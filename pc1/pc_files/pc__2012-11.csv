Androgen ablation/androgen receptor inhibition remains as the mainstay of treatment for advanced prostate cancer. Our understanding of the biology of prostate cancer has increased exponentially owing to advances in molecular biology. With this knowledge many intriguing issues have come to light, which clinicians and scientists alike strive to answer. These include why prostate cancer is so common, what drives the development of prostate cancer at a molecular level, why prostate cancer appears refractory to many families of cytotoxic chemotherapeutics, and why prostate cancer preferentially metastasizes to bone. Two clinical forms of prostate cancer have been identified: indolent organ confined disease, which elderly men often die of, and aggressive metastatic disease. A method of distinguishing between these two forms of the disease at an organ-confined stage remains elusive. Understanding the mechanisms of castrate resistance is a further issue of clinical importance. New trials of treatments, including molecular agents that target prostate cancer from a range of angles, have been instituted over the past 10-15 years. We can look at these trials not only as a chance to investigate the effectiveness of new treatments but also as an opportunity to further understand the complex biology of this disease.""","""[""C O'Hanlon Brown"", 'J Waxman']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Br J Radiol""","""['The biology of hormone refractory prostate cancer.

A total of 114 patients received combinations of MFSB, MB, and TZB based on prostate gland volume: those ≤15 cc received 8 biopsies; those >15 cc but ≤ 50 cc received 14 biopsies; and those >50 cc received 20 biopsies. The mean prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, Gleason score, and prostate volume were 8.0 ng/ml, 6.4, and 47 cc, respectively. PCa detection rate of the MB was 25% while the MFSB was 22%. The overall PCa detection rate was 33.3% with all biopsies. PCa and high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HG-PIN) detection rates decrease as the size of the prostate increases. PCa detection rates were 50.0% for volumes ≤19.9 cc and volumes of >50 cc had a detection rate of 25.8%. PSA levels of <3.0 had PCa detection rates of 15% which increased to 58% with PSA levels >9.0. In a multivariate analysis, only TZB was significant for PCa diagnosed by PSA (β=7.4, p<0.01). Our study showed that it is important to perform both the lateral MFSB and the MB to improve overall PCa detections rates. Thus, we recommend performing MB, MFSB, and TZB based on prostate volume, as follows: 8 biopsies for ≤15 cc; 14 for those >15 cc but ≤50 cc, and 14-20 for those >50 cc.""","""['Priya N Werahera', 'Kathryn Sullivan', 'Francisco G La Rosa', 'Fernando J Kim', 'M Scott Lucia', ""Colin O'Donnell"", 'Rameshwar S Sidhu', 'Holly T Sullivan', 'Beth Schulte', 'E David Crawford']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Int J Clin Exp Pathol""","""['Incremental value of transition zone and midline apical biopsy at baseline TRUS-guided biopsy for prostate cancer detection.', 'Prebiopsy Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging for Prostate Cancer Diagnosis in Biopsy-naive Men with Suspected Prostate Cancer Based on Elevated Prostate-specific Antigen Values: Results from a Randomized Prospective Blinded Controlled Trial.', 'Three-Tesla magnetic resonance-guided prostate biopsy in men with increased prostate-specific antigen and repeated, negative, random, systematic, transrectal ultrasound biopsies: detection of clinically significant prostate cancers.', 'Contemporary role of systematic prostate biopsies: indications, techniques, and implications for patient care.', 'Is an initial saturation prostate biopsy scheme better than an extended scheme for detection of prostate cancer?

Preventive services are key to reducing the burden of non-communicable diseases, and smoking counseling and cessation are among the most cost-effective and wide-reaching strategies. Internal medicine physicians are fundamental to providing such services, and their knowledge is a cornerstone of non-communicable disease control.  Methods:   A national cross-sectional survey was conducted in 2011 to evaluate knowledge of clinical preventive services for non-communicable diseases. Interns, residents, and attending physicians of the internal medicine departments of all teaching hospitals in Guatemala completed a self-administered questionnaire. Participants' responses were contrasted with the Guatemalan Ministry of Health (MoH) prevention guidelines and the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendations. Analysis compared knowledge of recommendations within and between hospitals.  Results:   In response to simulated patient scenarios, all services were recommended by more than half of physicians regardless of MoH or USPSTF recommendations. Prioritization was adequate according to the MoH guidelines but not including other potentially effective services (e.g. colorectal cancer and lipid disorder screenings). With the exception of colorectal and prostate cancer screening, less frequently recommended by interns, there was no difference in recommendation rates by level.  Conclusion:   Guatemalan internal medicine physicians' knowledge on preventive services recommendations for non-communicable diseases is limited, and prioritization did not reflect cost-effectiveness. Based on these data we recommend that preventive medicine training be strengthened and development of evidence-based guidelines for low-middle income countries be a priority.""","""['Juan E Corral', 'Lauren D Arnold', 'Erwin E Argueta', 'Akshay Ganju', 'Joaquín Barnoya']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Assessment of Physician Priorities in Delivery of Preventive Care.', 'Correlates of clinical preventive practices among internal medicine residents.', 'Awareness and attitudes of pre-exposure prophylaxis for HIV prevention among physicians in Guatemala: Implications for country-wide implementation.', 'An Ecological Model to Frame the Delivery of Pediatric Preventive Care.', 'Life course health care and preemptive approach to non-communicable diseases.', 'Perceptions of chronic kidney disease among at-risk adults in rural Guatemala.', 'CKD Care and Research in Guatemala: Overview and Meeting Report.', 'Primary Care Physicians Practicing Preventive Medicine in the Outpatient Setting.', 'Increasing chronic disease research capacity in Guatemala through a mentoring program.']"""

Recently, several global DNA methylation profiles have been reported in PCa, however, each of these has weaknesses in terms of ability to observe global DNA methylation alterations in PCa. We hypothesize that there remains unidentified aberrant DNA methylation in PCa, which may be identified using higher resolution assay methods. We used the newly developed Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip in PCa (n = 19) and adjacent normal tissues (n = 4) and combined these with gene expression data for identifying new DNA methylation that may have functional consequences in PCa development and progression. We also confirmed our methylation results in an independent data set. Two aberrant DNA methylation genes were validated among an additional 56 PCa samples and 55 adjacent normal tissues. A total 28,735 CpG sites showed significant differences in DNA methylation (FDR adjusted P<0.05), defined as a mean methylation difference of at least 20% between PCa and normal samples. Furthermore, a total of 122 genes had more than one differentially methylated CpG site in their promoter region and a gene expression pattern that was inverse to the direction of change in DNA methylation (e.g. decreased expression with increased methylation, and vice-versa). Aberrant DNA methylation of two genes, AOX1 and SPON2, were confirmed via bisulfate sequencing, with most of the respective CpG sites showing significant differences between tumor samples and normal tissues. The AOX1 promoter region showed hypermethylation in 92.6% of 54 tested PCa samples in contrast to only three out of 53 tested normal tissues. This study used a new BeadChip combined with gene expression data in PCa to identify novel differentially methylated CpG sites located within genes. The newly identified differentially methylated genes may be used as biomarkers for PCa diagnosis.""","""['Jin W Kim', 'Seong-Tae Kim', 'Aubrey R Turner', 'Tracey Young', 'Shelly Smith', 'Wennuan Liu', 'Johan Lindberg', 'Lars Egevad', 'Henrik Gronberg', 'William B Isaacs', 'Jianfeng Xu']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Epigenomic profiling of DNA methylation in paired prostate cancer versus adjacent benign tissue.', 'Identification of novel DNA-methylated genes that correlate with human prostate cancer and high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia.', 'Genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation in prostate cancer using the technology of Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (HM450).', 'Epigenome-wide DNA methylation and transcriptome profiling of localized and locally advanced prostate cancer: Uncovering new molecular markers.', 'Epigenetic regulation of EFEMP1 in prostate cancer: biological relevance and clinical potential.', 'Consistent DNA Hypomethylations in Prostate Cancer.', 'Sperm DNA methylome abnormalities occur both pre- and post-treatment in men with Hodgkin disease and testicular cancer.', 'Methylation pattern of caveolin-1 in prostate cancer as potential cfDNA biomarker.', 'Dysregulation of DNA Methylation and Epigenetic Clocks in Prostate Cancer among Puerto Rican Men.', 'The Multifaceted Role of Aldehyde Dehydrogenases in Prostate Cancer Stem Cells.']"""

Procedures:   25 PCa patients with inguinal (presumed benign) and enlarged pelvic LN (presumed malignant) showing enhanced [(18)F]FCH uptake at dual-phase PET-CT were analyzed. Associations between LN status (benign versus malignant) and SUV(max) and SUV(meanA50), determined at 2 min (early) and 30 min (late) post injection, were assessed. We considered two time-trends of [(18)F]FCH uptake: type A (SUV early > SUV late) and type B (SUV late ≥ SUV early). Histopathology and/or follow-up were used to confirm the assumption that LN with type A pattern are benign, and LN with type B pattern malignant.  Results:   Analysis of 54 nodes showed that LN status, time-trends, and 'late' (30 min p.i.) SUV(max) and SUV(meanA50) parameters were strongly associated (P<0.0001). SUV(max) relative difference was the best LN status predictor. All but one inguinal LN showed a decreasing [(18)F]FCH uptake over time (pattern A), while 95% of the pelvic nodes presented a stable or increasing uptake (pattern B) type.  Conclusions:   Time-trends of enhanced [(18)F]FCH uptake can help to characterize lymph nodes in prostate cancer patients.

We analyzed the efficacy of long-term treatment with ≥10 cycles of docetaxel, and validated the risk group classification in predicting overall survival (OS) in Japanese patients with mCRPC.  Patients and methods:   Fifty-two patients with mCRPC were administered 55 mg/m(2) docetaxel and 8 mg dexamethasone, every 3 or 4 weeks, simultaneously with hormonal therapy and daily oral dexamethasone. They were divided into two groups, short-term (9 or fewer cycles) and long-term (10 or more cycles). Four risk factors including the presence of anemia, bone metastases, significant pain and visceral metastases were utilized for the risk group classification.  Results:   Fourteen patients (27%) had an elevation of PSA in spite of docetaxel treatment, while 23 patients (44%) had a decline in PSA level, including 9 patients (17%) whose PSA level declined by ≥50%.

One study of circulating thyroid hormones supports this hypothesis with respect to prostate cancer. We undertook a prospective analysis of thyroid hormones and prostate cancer risk in the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention (ATBC) Study.  Methods:   Within the ATBC Study, a randomized controlled trial of α-tocopherol and β-carotene supplements and cancer incidence in male smokers, 402 prostate cancer cases were sampled. Controls were matched 2:1 to cases on age and date of blood collection. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of prostate cancer were estimated for quintiles of serum total and free thyroxine (T4), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), thyroid-binding globulin (TBG), and by categories of thyroid status.  Results:   Men with serum higher TSH had a decreased risk of prostate cancer compared to men with lower TSH (Q5 vs. Q1-4: OR = 0.70, 95% CI: 0.51-0.97, p = 0.03).

Results revealed that fucoxanthin significantly inhibited the growth of sarcoma at the dose of 50 or 100 mg/kg. TUNEL analysis showed that the number of positive cells in the fucoxanthin-treated group was higher than that in the control group. Western blotting analysis also revealed the suppressed expression of bcl-2 and enhanced expression of cleaved caspase-3 by fucoxanthin. In addition, immunohistochemistry analysis and Western blotting analysis showed that fucoxanthin significantly decreased the expressions of survivin and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Most importantly, fucoxanthin inhibited the expressions of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and STAT3 and phosphorylated STAT3 proteins.

Analysis of archival gene expression data demonstrated that AIF transcript levels are elevated in human prostate cancer, and we found that AIF protein is increased in prostate tumors. Suppression of AIF expression in the prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP, DU145, and PC3 demonstrated that AIF does not contribute to cell toxicity via a variety of chemical death triggers, and growth under nutrient-rich conditions is largely unaffected by AIF ablation. However, under growth stress conditions, AIF depletion from DU145 and PC3 cell lines led to significant reductions in cell survival and growth that were not observed in LNCaP cells. Moreover AIF-deficient PC3 cells exhibited substantial reduction of tumorigenic growth in vivo. This reduced survival correlated with decreased expression of mitochondrial complex I protein subunits and concomitant changes in glucose metabolism. Finally, restoration of AIF-deficient PC3 cells with AIF variants demonstrated that the enzymatic activity of AIF is required for aggressive growth.

Recent success in retargeting persistent AR activity with next generation androgen/AR axis inhibitors such as enzalutamide (MDV3100) has validated AR as a master regulator during all stages of disease progression. However, resistance to next generation AR inhibitors limits therapeutic efficacy for many patients. One emerging mechanism of CRPC progression is AR gene rearrangement, promoting synthesis of constitutively active truncated AR splice variants (AR-V) that lack the AR ligand-binding domain. In this study, we show that cells with AR gene rearrangements expressing both full-length and AR-Vs are androgen independent and enzalutamide resistant. However, selective knock-down of AR-V expression inhibited androgen-independent growth and restored responsiveness to androgens and antiandrogens. In heterogeneous cell populations, AR gene rearrangements marked individual AR-V-dependent cells that were resistant to enzalutamide. Gene expression profiling following knock-down of full-length AR or AR-Vs showed that AR-Vs drive resistance to AR-targeted therapy by functioning as constitutive and independent effectors of the androgen/AR transcriptional program. Further, mitotic genes deemed previously to be unique AR-V targets were found to be biphasic targets associated with a proliferative level of signaling output from either AR-Vs or androgen-stimulated AR. Overall, these studies highlight AR-Vs as key mediators of persistent AR signaling and resistance to the current arsenal of conventional and next generation AR-directed therapies, advancing the concept of AR-Vs as therapeutic targets in advanced disease.""","""['Yingming Li', 'Siu Chiu Chan', 'Lucas J Brand', 'Tae Hyun Hwang', 'Kevin A T Silverstein', 'Scott M Dehm']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Cancer Res""","""['Words of wisdom.

CIP2A acts by inhibiting protein phosphatase 2A-dependent destabilization of c-Myc, resulting in increased cell proliferation. Here, we have characterized the proximal promoter region of the human CIP2A gene in cervical, endometrial and liver carcinoma cells. The 5' flanking minimal proximal promoter of the CIP2A gene consists of putative binding sites for Ets1 and Elk1 in forward and reverse orientations. Here, we show that Ets1 and Elk1 binding is essential for CIP2A basal expression in several urogenital cancer cell lines. Interestingly, both Ets1 and Elk1 are required together for CIP2A expression, as siRNA knockdown of Ets1 and Elk1 together decreased CIP2A gene transcription, whereas knockdown of Ets1 or Elk1 alone had no effect. Moreover, ectopic expression of Ets1 and Elk1 together increased CIP2A expression. To gain physiological significance of the Ets1 and Elk1 regulation we observed, a panel of matched human cervical carcinoma samples was analyzed for the expression of CIP2A and Ets1 and/or Elk1. We found a direct correlation between the levels of CIP2A and the levels of Ets1 and Elk1. Our results suggest that the binding of Ets1 and Elk1 together to the proximal CIP2A promoter is absolutely required for CIP2A expression in cervical, endometrial and liver carcinoma cell lines.

Design, setting, and participants:   A total of 111 patients with a mean age of 67.9 yr (range: 49-81 yr) and progressive mCRPC were included. Patients had received a mean number of 12.7 ± 10.8 cycles (range: 6-69 cycles) of docetaxel with a mean cumulative dose of 970.9 mg/m(2); mean time from last docetaxel application to progression was 6.95 mo (range: 2-54 mo). Of the patients, 31.5% progressed by prostate-specific antigen (PSA) increase only; the remainder had a combination of PSA increase and clinical progression.  Intervention:   Cbz at a dosage of 25mg/m(2) intravenously every 3 wk combined with 5mg of oral prednisone twice a day.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Treatment-associated toxicity was the primary study end point; progression-free and overall survival were secondary end points.

Materials and methods:   For ten patients, two VMAT plans were generated: one with Monaco TPS (Elekta) and one with Pinnacle TPS (Philips Medical Systems). The total prescribed dose was 78 Gy delivered in one 360° arc with a Synergy(®) linear accelerator equipped with a MLCi2(®).  Results:   VMAT with Monaco provided better homogeneity and conformity indexes but lower mean dose to PTVs than Pinnacle. For the bladder wall (p = 0.019), the femoral heads (p = 0.017), and healthy tissues (p = 0.005), significantly lower mean doses were found using Monaco. For the rectal wall, VMAT with Pinnacle provided a significantly (p = 0.047) lower mean dose, and lower dose into 50% of the volume (p = 0.047) compared to Monaco. Despite a greater number of monitor units (factor 1.5) for Monaco TPS, the total treatment time was equivalent to that of Pinnacle. The treatment delivery parameter analysis showed larger mean MLC area for Pinnacle and lower mean dose rate compared to Monaco. The quality control results gave a high passing rate (>97.4%) for the gamma index for both TPS but Monaco provided slightly better results.  Conclusion:   For prostate cancer patients, VMAT treatment plans obtained with Monaco and Pinnacle offered clinically acceptable dose distributions.

While the relationship between PCA3 score and clinical or histological prostatitis was quite proven even in small patient groups, conversely the relationship between PCA3 score and HG-PIN is still under debate. We demonstrated in a large series (432 patients) that histologically documented chronic prostatitis and HG-PIN have similar PCA3 scores to patients with BPH and/or normal parenchyma at biopsy.  Objective:   To determine whether histological chronic prostatitis and high-grade prostate intra-epithelial neoplasia (HG-PIN) influence the prostate cancer gene 3 (PCA3) score in Italian patients with an elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level and a negative digital rectal examination (DRE) who were undergoing a first or repeat prostate biopsy.  Patients and methods:   A urinary PCA3 test was prospectively performed in 432 consecutive patients who were admitted to Gradenigo Hospital (Turin, Italy) between January and December 2011 and scheduled for first or repeat prostate biopsy as a result of an elevated PSA level and negative DRE. A comparison of the PCA3 score and patients with a negative biopsy (normal parenchyma, benign prostatic hyperplasia, chronic prostatitis, HG-PIN) or positive biopsy was performed.  Results:   PCA3 median (range) scores varied significantly (P < 0.001) in men with a negative vs positive biopsy: 33 (2-212) and 66 (5-324), respectively. By contrast, men with chronic prostatitis and HG-PIN showed no significant difference with respect to PCA3 score compared to other negative biopsy patients. No correlation was found between the number of positive cores for chronic prostatitis, HG-PIN and PCA3 score. Of all patients with a positive biopsy, 23 (20%) of 114 men had a PCA3 score ≤ 35. In total, 79 (40%) of 197 men with a negative biopsy (normal parenchyma and benign prostatic hyperplasia), 24 (37.5%) of 64 men with chronic prostatitis and 19 (39.6%) of 48 men with HG-PIN had a PCA3 score >35.

Enhanced osteoclastogenesis is an essential feature associated with metastatic PCA in the bone microenvironment. Silibinin, an effective chemopreventive agent, is in phase II clinical trials in PCA patients but its efficacy against PCA cells-induced osteoclastogenesis is largely unknown. Accordingly, here we examined silibinin effect on PCA cells-induced osteoclastogenesis employing human PCA (PC3MM2, PC3, and C4-2B) and murine macrophage RAW264.7 cells. We also assessed silibinin effect on receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand (RANKL)-induced signaling associated with osteoclast differentiation in RAW264.7 cells. Further, we analyzed silibinin effect on osteomimicry biomarkers in PCA cells. Results revealed that silibinin (30-90 μM) inhibits PCA cells-induced osteoclast activity and differentiation in RAW264.7 cells via modulating expression of several cytokines (IGF-1, TGF-β, TNF-α, I-TAC, M-CSF, G-CSF, GM-CSF, etc.) that are important in osteoclastogenesis. Additionally, in RAW264.7 cells, silibinin decreased the RANKL-induced expression and nuclear localization of NFATc1, which is considered the master regulator of osteoclastogenesis. Furthermore, silibinin decreased the RANKL-induced DNA binding activity of NFATc1 and its regulators NF-κB and AP1, and the protein expression of osteoclast specific markers (TRAP, OSCAR, and cathepsin K).

One hundred and thirty-five patients (64.6 %) had locally advanced disease. Conventional clinical tumour stage and MRI-assessed tumour stage were compared with histopathological tumour stage (pT).

Both agents dose-dependently inhibited proliferation of these cells. In PC-3 and DU145 subcutaneous xenografts, treatment with dasatinib, sunitinib or anti-Cav-1 antibody (Ab) alone produced significant tumor regression compared with that by vehicle or IgG alone. Combined dasatinib and anti-Cav-1 Ab treatment or sunitinib and anti-Cav-1 Ab produced greater tumor regression than either treatment alone. Serum Cav-1 levels were lower in dasatinib- and sunitinib-treated mice than they were in vehicle-treated mice, and correlated positively with tumor growth in dasatinib- and sunitinib-treated groups (r = 0.48, p = 0.031; r = 0.554, p = 0.0065, respectively), compared with vehicle controls. Cav-1 knockdown, in combination with dasatinib or sunitinib treatment in PC-3 cells, caused a greater reduction in the phosphorylation of PDGFR-β and VEGFR2, and expression and secretion of PDGF-B and VEGF-A than that in PC-3 cells treated with dasatinib or sunitinib alone in control siRNA cells, suggesting that Cav-1 is involved in an autocrine pathway that is affected by these drugs.

Therefore, we investigated the effect of sphingosine kinase inhibitors on androgen receptor expression.  Experimental approach:   Androgen-sensitive LNCaP cells were treated with SKi (2-(p-hydroxyanilino)-4-(p-chlorophenyl)thiazole), which inhibits sphingosine kinases 1 and 2 activity, and the effect on androgen receptor expression was measured.  Key results:   Treatment of cells with SK1 inhibitors reduced the expression of the androgen receptor and prostate-specific antigen, while (R)-FTY720 methyl ether (a sphingosine-kinase-2-selective inhibitor), at a concentration that eliminates sphingosine kinase 2 from cells, had no significant effect on androgen receptor expression. The effect of SKi on androgen receptor expression was independent of the SKi-induced proteasomal degradation of SK1 and was post translational, although androgen receptor mRNA transcript was reduced. Fumonisin B1 (a ceramide synthase inhibitor) also failed to reverse the effect of SKi on androgen receptor expression, thereby excluding a role for ceramide derived from the salvage pathway. The effect of SKi on androgen receptor expression was reversed by N-acetylcysteine, which was used to scavenge reactive oxygen species.  Conclusion and implications:   Inhibition of sphingosine kinase 1 activity abrogates androgen receptor signalling via an oxidative stress-induced, p53-independent mechanism in prostate cancer cells. Therefore, SK1 inhibitors may offer therapeutic potential in promoting the removal of AR receptors from prostate cancer cells, resulting in an increased efficacy, which is likely to be superior to inhibitors that simply reversibly inhibit AR signalling.""","""['Francesca Tonelli', 'Manal Alossaimi', 'Leon Williamson', 'Rothwelle J Tate', 'David G Watson', 'Edmond Chan', 'Robert Bittman', 'Nigel J Pyne', 'Susan Pyne']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Br J Pharmacol""","""['FTY720 and (S)-FTY720 vinylphosphonate inhibit sphingosine kinase 1 and promote its proteasomal degradation in human pulmonary artery smooth muscle, breast cancer and androgen-independent prostate cancer cells.', 'Proteasomal degradation of sphingosine kinase 1 and inhibition of dihydroceramide desaturase by the sphingosine kinase inhibitors, SKi or ABC294640, induces growth arrest in androgen-independent LNCaP-AI prostate cancer cells.', 'The roles of sphingosine kinases 1 and 2 in regulating the Warburg effect in prostate cancer cells.', 'Structure-function analysis of lipid substrates and inhibitors of sphingosine kinases.', 'Therapeutic potential of targeting sphingosine kinase 1 in prostate cancer.', 'TRIM14 promotes colorectal cancer cell migration and invasion through the SPHK1/STAT3 pathway.', 'Interdiction of Sphingolipid Metabolism Revisited: Focus on Prostate Cancer.', 'The Evaluation of Oxidative Stress Parameters in Serum Patients with Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis Treated with II-Line Immunomodulatory Therapy.', 'The emerging role of FTY720 (Fingolimod) in cancer treatment.', 'The Sphingosine Kinase 2 Inhibitor ABC294640 Reduces the Growth of Prostate Cancer Cells and Results in Accumulation of Dihydroceramides In Vitro and In Vivo.']"""

Methods:   Survivors (N = 1,822) and adults with no cancer history (N = 24,804) were identified from the 2010 National Health Interview Survey. The PROMIS® Global Health Scale was used to assess HRQOL. Poor HRQOL was defined as 1 SD or more below the PROMIS® population norm.  Results:   Poor physical and mental HRQOL were reported by 24.5% and 10.1% of survivors, respectively, compared with 10.2% and 5.9% of adults without cancer (both P < 0.0001).

GISTs can be located at any level of the gastrointestinal tract; the stomach is the most common location (60-70%), in contrast to the rectum, which is most rare (4%). When a GIST invades into the adjacent prostate tissue, it can simulate prostate cancer. In this study, we report on a case comprising the unexpected collision between a rectal GIST tumour and a prostatic adenocarcinoma.

The confounder tissue classes can often mimic and share attributes with both the diseased and normal tissue classes, and can be particularly difficult to identify, both manually and by automated classifiers. In the case of prostate cancer, they may be several confounding tissue types present in a biopsy sample, posing as major sources of diagnostic error for pathologists. Two common multi-class approaches are one-shot classification (OSC), where all classes are identified simultaneously, and one-versus-all (OVA), where a ""target"" class is distinguished from all ""non-target"" classes. OSC is typically unable to handle discrimination of classes of varying similarity (e.g. with images of prostate atrophy and high grade cancer), while OVA forces several heterogeneous classes into a single ""non-target"" class. In this work, we present a cascaded (CAS) approach to classifying prostate biopsy tissue samples, where images from different classes are grouped to maximize intra-group homogeneity while maximizing inter-group heterogeneity.  Results:   We apply the CAS approach to categorize 2000 tissue samples taken from 214 patient studies into seven classes: epithelium, stroma, atrophy, prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN), and prostate cancer Gleason grades 3, 4, and 5. A series of increasingly granular binary classifiers are used to split the different tissue classes until the images have been categorized into a single unique class. Our automatically-extracted image feature set includes architectural features based on location of the nuclei within the tissue sample as well as texture features extracted on a per-pixel level. The CAS strategy yields a positive predictive value (PPV) of 0.86 in classifying the 2000 tissue images into one of 7 classes, compared with the OVA (0.77 PPV) and OSC approaches (0.76 PPV).  Conclusions:   Use of the CAS strategy increases the PPV for a multi-category classification system over two common alternative strategies. In classification problems such as histopathology, where multiple class groups exist with varying degrees of heterogeneity, the CAS system can intelligently assign class labels to objects by performing multiple binary classifications according to domain knowledge.""","""['Scott Doyle', 'Michael D Feldman', 'Natalie Shih', 'John Tomaszewski', 'Anant Madabhushi']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""BMC Bioinformatics""","""['Deep Learning-Based Gleason Grading of Prostate Cancer From Histopathology Images-Role of Multiscale Decision Aggregation and Data Augmentation.', 'Computerized Classification of Prostate Cancer Gleason Scores from Whole Slide Images.', 'Comparison of Artificial Intelligence Techniques to Evaluate Performance of a Classifier for Automatic Grading of Prostate Cancer From Digitized Histopathologic Images.', 'Current prostate biopsy interpretation: criteria for cancer, atypical small acinar proliferation, high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, and use of immunostains.', 'Histopathology reporting of prostate needle biopsies. 2005 update.', 'Artificial Intelligence for Clinical Diagnosis and Treatment of Prostate Cancer.', 'Computer extracted gland features from H&E predicts prostate cancer recurrence comparably to a genomic companion diagnostic test: a large multi-site study.', 'Predicting Metastasis Risk in Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors Using Deep Learning Image Analysis.', 'Deep Learning-Based Object Detection, Localisation and Tracking for Smart Wheelchair Healthcare Mobility.', 'Reimagining T Staging Through Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Image Processing Approaches in Digital Pathology.']"""

It has been proposed that the pain interference factor can be further broken down into unique factors of affective (e.g., mood) and activity (e.g., work) interference. The purpose of this analysis was to confirm this affective/activity interference dichotomy.  Patients and methods:   A retrospective confirmatory factor analysis was completed for a sample of 184 individuals diagnosed with castrate-resistant prostate cancer (age 40-86, mean = 65.46, 77% White non-Hispanic) who had been administered the BPI as part of Cancer and Leukemia Group B trial 9480. A one-factor model was compared against two-factor and three-factor models that were developed based on the design of the instrument.  Results:   Root mean squared error of approximation (0.075), comparative fit index (0.971), and change in chi-square, given the corresponding change in degrees of freedom (13.33, P < 0.05) values for the three-factor model (i.e., pain intensity, activity interference, and affective interference), were statistically superior in comparison with the one- and two-factor models. This three-factor structure was found to be invariant across age, mean prostate-specific antigen, and hemoglobin levels.  Conclusions:   These results confirm that the BPI can be used to quantify the degree to which pain separately interferes with affective and activity aspects of a patient's everyday life. These findings will provide clinical trialists, pharmaceutical sponsors, and regulators with confidence in the flexibility of the BPI as they consider the use of this instrument to assist with understanding the patient experience as it relates to treatment.""","""['Thomas M Atkinson', 'Susan Halabi', 'Antonia V Bennett', 'Lauren Rogak', 'Laura Sit', 'Yuelin Li', 'Ellen Kaplan', 'Ethan Basch;Cancer and Leukemia Group B']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Pain Med""","""['Using confirmatory factor analysis to evaluate construct validity of the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI).', 'Translation and Validation of the Thai Version of a Modified Brief Pain Inventory: A Concise Instrument for Pain Assessment in Postoperative Cardiac Surgery.', 'Validation of the Brief Pain Inventory in Patients With Low Back Pain.', 'One, two, or three?

Diethylstilbestrol (DES) was the first hormone treatment used for prostate cancer and has also shown effectiveness in castration-resistant disease in small studies; however, concerns over thromboembolic toxicity have restricted its use in the past. Over 200 elderly men with castration-resistant prostate cancer were treated with 1-3 mg of DES, given with 75 mg aspirin and breast bud irradiation. Almost 30% of men showed a significant PSA response and the median time to PSA progression was 4.6 months. Almost 20% of patients with pain had a significant analgesic benefit. The most important toxicity was thromboembolism in 10% of men. Overall the drug has an acceptable toxicity profile and offers a palliative benefit in frail elderly men who may not be fit for chemotherapy.  Objective:   • To assess the efficacy and toxicity of diethylstilbestrol (DES) in the management of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).  Patients and methods:   • A total of 231 patients with CRPC received treatment with DES at the Royal Marsden Hospital between August 1992 and August 2000. • The median pre-treatment prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level was 221 ng/mL. • DES was used at a dose of 1-3 mg daily, with aspirin 75 mg. • The primary endpoint was PSA response rate.  Results:   • The PSA response rate (using PSA Working Group criteria) was 28.9%. • The median time to PSA progression was 4.6 months. • Of patients with bone pain, 18% had an improvement in their European Organisation for the Research and Treatment of Cancer pain score. • Thromboembolic complications were seen in 9.9% of all patients.

We previously reported that the positive association between calcium intake and risk of aggressive prostate cancer was modified by the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the CDX-2 binding site of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene, among African American men.  Methods:   We expanded our previous study to include White men, a population with a higher calcium intake and a higher prevalence of the low absorption allele. We also examined VDR polymorphisms at other loci unrelated to calcium absorption. The study included 1,857 prostate cancer cases (1,140 with advanced stage at diagnosis, 717 with localized stage) and 1,096 controls. OR were estimated using conditional logistic regression.  Results:   Among both Blacks and Whites, we observed a threshold for calcium intake (604 mg/d) below which prostate cancer risk declined sharply. Low calcium intake was most strongly associated with decreased risk among men with the VDR Cdx2 low calcium absorption genotype (P for interaction = 0.001 and P = 0.06 for Whites and African Americans, respectively). Among all men with this genotype, those in the lowest quartile of calcium intake (≤604 mg/d) had a 50% reduction in risk as compared with those in the upper three quartiles [OR = 0.49; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.36-0.67]. The association between calcium intake and prostate cancer risk was not modified by genotype at other VDR loci.

Selenoprotein P is the most abundant selenoprotein in serum and delivers ten selenocysteine residues to tissues. Variation in the selenoprotein P gene (SEPP1) may influence PCa development or modify the effects of selenium. We examined the association of SEPP1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with PCa risk and survival, and tested for interactions.  Methods:   The Physicians' Health Study (PHS) is a prospective cohort of 22,071 US physicians; we utilized a nested case-control study of 1,352 PCa cases and 1,382 controls. We assessed four SNPs capturing common variation within the SEPP1 locus. In a subset of men (n = 80), we evaluated SEPP1 mRNA expression in tumors.  Results:   Two SNPs were significantly associated with PCa risk. For rs11959466, each T allele increased risk (odds ratio (OR) = 1.31; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.02,1.69; P(trend) = 0.03). For rs13168440, the rare homozygote genotype decreased risk compared to the common homozygote (OR = 0.56, 95% CI: 0.33, 0.96). Moreover, there was a significant interaction of rs13168440 with plasma selenium; increasing selenium levels were associated with decreased PCa risk only among men with the minor allele (P(interaction) = 0.01). SEPP1 expression was significantly lower in men with lethal PCa than long-term survivors.

More knowledge concerning neuroendocrine (NE)-transformed PC cells, the NED process and its association with CRPC, is needed. Expression of growth factor midkine (MDK) is correlated with poor clinical outcomes in various human cancers, including PC. In the present study, we have evaluated MDK expression and NED in two separate tumor groups: early and advanced PC.  Methods:   Immunohistochemical analysis of MDK, the neuronal marker tubulin-beta III (TUBB3) and the NE-marker chromogranin A (CGA) in a human archival material consisting of hormone naive (HN)/stage T1b (n = 29) and CRPC (n = 24) tumors. Triple immunofluorescent imaging was performed on a selection of specimens.  Results:   MDK, TUBB3, and CGA were upregulated in CRPC compared to HN tumors. MDK was highly associated to the expression of both CGA and TUBB3, and identified MDK-positive NE-like looking cells found to co-express CGA or, more commonly, CGA together with TUBB3.

Recently, a low frequency recurring mutation in the HOXB13 gene was reported among both hereditary PC families and men from the general population.  Materials and methods:   We determined the distribution and frequency of the G84E HOXB13 variant in 1,310 incipient PC cases and 1,259 age-mated controls from a population-based, case-control study of PC.  Results:   The G84E mutation was more frequent in cases than controls (1.3% vs. 0.4%, respectively), and men with the HOXB13 G84E variant had a 3.3-fold higher relative risk of PC compared with noncarriers (95% CI, 1.21-8.96). There was a stronger association between the G84E variant and PC among men with no first-degree relative with PC (OR, 4.04; 95% CI, 1.12-14.51) compared to men with a family history of PC (OR, 1.49; 95% CI, 0.30-7.50; P = 0.36 for interaction). We observed some evidence of higher risk estimates associated with the variant for men with higher versus lower Gleason score (OR, 4.13; 95% CI, 1.38-12.38 vs. OR, 2.71; 95% CI, 0.88-8.30), and advanced versus local stage (OR, 4.47; 95% CI, 1.28-15.57 vs. OR, 2.98; 95% CI, 1.04-8.49), however these differences were not statistically different.

Here, we report the paradoxical stabilization of the prostate-specific tumor suppressor NKX3.1 by the oncogenic protein kinase Pim-1 in prostate cancer cells. Pharmacologic Pim-1 inhibition using the small molecule inhibitor CX-6258 decreased steady state levels and half-life of NKX3.1 protein but mRNA was not affected. This effect was reversed by inhibition of the 26S-proteasome, demonstrating that Pim-1 protects NKX3.1 from proteasome-mediated degradation.

However, the signal pathways that can augment the proapoptotic function of ROS remain largely unknown. We previously identified a tumor suppressor, alpha-tocopherol-associated protein (TAP), yet little is known regarding the role of TAP in the apoptotic signaling in prostate cancer. Interestingly, we recently found that exposure of prostate cancer cells to hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2) ) resulted in induced apoptosis as well as increased expression of TAP. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) mediated silencing of endogenous TAP expression conferred effective protection from H(2)O(2) -induced apoptosis. Further mechanistic study showed exposure of prostate cancer cells to H(2)O(2) resulted in increased phosphorylation of both JNK and c-Jun, and TAP siRNA effectively decreased H(2)O(2) -induced JNK and c-Jun phosphorylation. Immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that JNK physically associates with TAP. Furthermore, signaling downstream of JNK to the AP-1 complex and BH-3-only subfamily were found to be regulated on changing the TAP expression status. TAP could also promote the oxidative stress-induced apoptosis effect of docetaxel. In the mice xenograft model, H(2)O(2) treatment induced TAP expression, JNK phosphorylation and apoptosis of prostate cancer. Recombinant adeno-associated virus 2 (rAAV2)-TAP injection significantly sensitizes this H(2)O(2) proapoptotic effect. Together, we have identified a novel functional mechanism that the cross-talk of TAP-JNK is involved in oxidative stress-induced apoptosis in prostate cancer cells.

Post-RP treatment options include adjuvant radiotherapy (ART, for men with undetectable PSA) or salvage radiotherapy (SRT, for PSA persisting or re-rising above detection threshold). Presently, there are no published randomized trials evaluating ART vs. SRT directly.  Methods:   Published data on ART and SRT were reviewed to allow a comparison of the two treatment approaches.  Results:   Three randomized phase III trials demonstrated an almost 20% absolute benefit for biochemical progression-free survival after ART (60-64 Gy) compared to a ""wait and see"" policy. The greatest benefit was achieved in patients with positive margins and pT3 tumors. SRT can be offered to patients with elevated PSA after RP. In 30-70% of SRT patients, PSA will decrease to an undetectable level, thus giving a second curative chance. The rate of side effects for both treatments is comparably low.

Protein expression was evaluated by standard immunohistochemistry methods.  Results:   In cell culture experiments, no change was detected in radiosensitivity after depletion of GIPC1/Synectin in GIPC1/Synectin-expressing prostate cancer cell lines. Furthermore, there was no correlation between GIPC1/Synectin expression in human pretreatment biopsy samples and overall or biochemical recurrence-free survival after radiotherapy in a retrospective analysis of the study cohort.  Conclusion:   Our results do not show a predictive or prognostic function of GIPC1/Synectin expression for the outcome of radiotherapy in prostate cancer.

The aim of the study was to evaluate FSH physiopathology along the pituitary-testicular-prostate (PTP) axis at the time of initial diagnosis of prostate cancer in an operated population clustered according to the FSH/PSA ratio.  Patients and methods:   The study included 93 patients who underwent standard radical prostatectomy.

Category variables were pT and biopsy/pathology Gleason pattern I/II (b/pGPI/II). The population was clustered according to the FSH/PSA ratio which was computed from empirical data and then ranked for clustering the population as groups A (range 0.13 ≤ FSH/PSA ≤ 0.20), B (range 0.20 < FSH/PSA ≤ 0.50), C (range 0.50 < FSH/PSA ≤ 0.75), D (range 0.75 < FSH/PSA ≤ 1.00), E (range 1.00 < FSH/PSA ≤ 1.25), F (range 1.25 < FSH/PSA ≤ 2.00), G (range 2.00 < FSH/PSA ≤ 2.25), H (range 2.25 < FSH/PSA ≤ 6.40) and I (range 6.40 < FSH/ PSA ≤ 19.40). The model was assessed by simple linear regression analysis and differences between the groups were investigated by analysis of variance (ANOVA) for continuous variables and by contingency tables for category variables.  Results:   FSH was significantly correlated to and predicted by PSA in groups A (p = 0.04), B (p < 0.0001), C (p < 0.0001), D (p < 0.0001), E (p < 0.0001), F (p < 0.0001), G (p < 0.0001), H (p = 0.0001) and I (p = 0.001).

Conclusion:   The ranking FSH/PSA ratio significantly clustered, along the PTP axis, an operated population diagnosed with prostate cancer. Also, the ranking FSH/PSA ratio selected prostate cancer clusters expressing different levels of hormonal disorder along the PTP axis and prognostic potential with different risks of progression.

Preclinical studies have shown that DCP overcomes the problem of CBP instability in aqueous solution and maintains anticancer effects. Clinical evaluation in a Phase I dose-escalation study in patients with tumors showed that DCP was tolerated at doses ranging from 100 to 550 mg/m(2) and had potential efficacy in Chinese cancer patients. DCP showed favourable bioavailability and stability in vivo, and the recommended Phase II dosage for DCP-containing chemotherapy is 450 mg/m(2). DCP is currently being investigated as a monotherapy in several cancer types, such as prostatic carcinoma, and in combination with paclitaxel in a Phase II non-lung cancer study.  Purpose:   Dicycloplatin (DCP) is a novel supramolecule composed of carboplatin (CBP) and 1,1-cyclobutane dicarboxylate (CBDCA) joined by a strong hydrogen bond. DCP is stable in aqueous solution unlike CBP alone. The purpose of this study was to assess the maximally tolerated dose, safety, and pharmacokinetics of DCP in Chinese cancer patients.  Experimental design:   29 patients were included in this study. DCP was administered by intravenous infusion over 1 hour once every 21 days. The dose of DCP was escalated from 50 mg/m(2) to 650 mg/m(2) using a modified Fibonacci scheme. Pharmacokinetic analysis was performed in 26 patients to determine the total and ultrafiltered platinum concentrations in plasma.  Results:   29 and 20 patients were evaluated for toxicities and response, respectively. The primary adverse effects were nausea/vomiting (58.6%), thrombocytopenia (24.1%), neutropenia (17.2%), anemia (20.7%), fatigue (10.3%), anorexia (10.3%), liver enzyme elevation (10.3%) and alopecia (3.5%). There was no significant toxicity with doses up to 350 mg/m(2). At higher doses, a variety of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were observed, including Grade 3/4 anemia, Grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia, and Grade 3/4 emesis under antiemetic treatment. The maximum tolerated dose of DCP was 550 mg/m(2). Two partial responses occurred in patients with non-cell lung cancer who had received cisplatin- or carboplatin-based chemotherapy. Plasma decay of total and free platinum concentrations was best fitted by using a twocompartment analysis. The terminal plasma half-life of total platinum after DCP administration ranged from 41.86 to 77.20 hours without significant dose dependency. However, the terminal plasma half-life of free platinum concentrations ranged from 42.34 to 61.07 hours.  Conclusions:   DCP displayed a favorable safety profile at doses between 50 mg/m(2) and 550 mg/m(2), and first efficacy signals were observed. DLTs were thrombocytopenia, anemia and emesis. The recommended starting dose for a subsequent Phase II study is 450 mg/m(2) once every 3 weeks.""","""['Su Li', 'He Huang', 'Hai Liao', 'Jing Zhan', 'Yin Guo', 'Ben-Yan Zou', 'Wen-Qi Jiang', 'Zhong-Zhen Guan', 'Xu-Qing Yang']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Int J Clin Pharmacol Ther""","""['Phase I trial of intravenous carboplatin and cyclosporin A in refractory gynecologic cancer patients.', 'Phase I trial of the matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor marimastat combined with carboplatin and paclitaxel in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer.', 'A phase I/IIA trial of continuous five-day infusion of squalamine lactate (MSI-1256F) plus carboplatin and paclitaxel in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer.', 'Clinical pharmacokinetics and dose optimisation of carboplatin.', 'Comparative adverse effect profiles of platinum drugs.', 'A double-blind, randomized phase II study of dicycloplatin plus paclitaxel versus carboplatin plus paclitaxel as first-line therapy for patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancers.']"""

Many strategies including image guided radiation therapy alleviate the problem to certain extents. The authors propose a new modality called emission guided radiation therapy (EGRT) to accurately and directly track the tumor based on its biological signature. This work is to demonstrate the feasibility of EGRT under two clinical scenarios using a 4D digital patient model.  Methods:   EGRT uses lines of response (LOR's) from positron emission events to direct beamlets of therapeutic radiation through the emission sites inside a tumor. This is accomplished by a radiation delivery system consisting of a Linac and positron emission tomography (PET) detectors on a fast rotating closed-ring gantry. During the treatment of radiotracer-administrated cancer patients, PET detectors collect LOR's from tumor uptake sites and the Linac responds in nearly real-time with beamlets of radiation along the same LOR paths. Moving tumors are therefore treated with a high targeting accuracy. Based on the EGRT concept, the authors design a treatment method with additional modulation algorithms including attenuation correction and an integrated boost scheme. Performance is evaluated using simulations of a lung tumor case with 3D motion and a prostate tumor case with setup errors. The emission process is simulated by Geant4 Application for Tomographic Emission package (GATE) and Linac dose delivery is simulated using a voxel-based Monte Carlo algorithm (VMC++).  Results:   In the lung case with attenuation correction, compared to a conventional helical treatment, EGRT achieves a 41% relative increase in dose to 95% of the gross tumor volume (GTV) and a 55% increase to 50% of the GTV. All dose distributions are normalized for the same dose to the lung. In the prostate case with the integrated boost and no setup error, EGRT yields a 19% and 55% relative dose increase to 95% and 50% of the GTV, respectively, when all methods are normalized for the same dose to the rectum. In the prostate case with integrated boost where setup error is present, EGRT contributes a 21% and 52% relative dose increase to 95% and 50% of the GTV, respectively.  Conclusions:   As a new radiation therapy modality with inherent tumor tracking, EGRT has the potential to substantially improve targeting in radiation therapy in the presence of intrafractional and interfractional motion.""","""['Qiyong Fan', 'Akshay Nanduri', 'Samuel Mazin', 'Lei Zhu']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Toward a planning scheme for emission guided radiation therapy (EGRT): FDG based tumor tracking in a metastatic breast cancer patient.', 'Technical aspects of real time positron emission tracking for gated radiotherapy.', ""A novel four-dimensional radiotherapy planning strategy from a tumor-tracking beam's eye view."", 'Recent advances in light ion radiation therapy.', 'Positron emission tomography for radiation treatment planning.', 'Positron Emission Tomography (PET)/Computed Tomography (CT) Imaging in Radiation Therapy Treatment Planning: A Review of PET Imaging Tracers and Methods to Incorporate PET/CT.', 'Mitigation of Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy and Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy Treatment Planning Errors on the Novel RefleXion X1 System Using Failure Mode and Effect Analysis Within Six Sigma Framework.', 'Feasibility of biology-guided radiotherapy using PSMA-PET to boost to dominant intraprostatic tumour.', 'A detailed process map for clinical workflow of a new biology-guided radiotherapy (BgRT) machine.', 'Real-time marker-less tumor tracking with TOF PET:in silicofeasibility study.']"""

In order to compensate for this movement, different techniques have been developed. In this study the tracking performances of a multileaf collimator (MLC) tracking system and a robotic treatment couch tracking system were compared under equal conditions.  Methods:   MLC tracking was performed using a tracking system based on the Siemens 160 MLC. A HexaPOD robotic treatment couch tracking system was also installed at the same linac. A programmable 4D motion stage was used to reproduce motion trajectories with different target phantoms. Motion localization of the target was provided by the 4D tracking system of Calypso Medical Inc. The gained positional data served as input signal for the control systems of the MLC and HexaPOD tracking systems attempting to compensate for the target motion. The geometric and dosimetric accuracy for the tracking of eight different respiratory motion trajectories was investigated for both systems. The dosimetric accuracy of both systems was also evaluated for the tracking of five prostate motion trajectories.  Results:   For the respiratory motion the average root mean square error of all trajectories in y direction was reduced from 4.1 to 2.0 mm for MLC tracking and to 2.2 mm for HexaPOD tracking. In x direction it was reduced from 1.9 to 0.9 mm (MLC) and to 1.0 mm (HexaPOD). The average 2%/2 mm gamma pass rate for the respiratory motion trajectories was increased from 76.4% for no tracking to 89.8% and 95.3% for the MLC and the HexaPOD tracking systems, respectively. For the prostate motion trajectories the average 2%/2 mm gamma pass rate was 60.1% when no tracking was applied and was improved to 85.0% for MLC tracking and 95.3% for the HexaPOD tracking system.  Conclusions:   Both systems clearly increased the geometric and dosimetric accuracy during tracking of respiratory motion trajectories. Thereby, the geometric accuracy was increased almost equally by both systems, whereas the dosimetric accuracy of the HexaPOD tracking system was slightly better for all considered respiratory motion trajectories. Substantial improvement of the dosimetric accuracy was also observed during tracking of prostate motion trajectories during an intensity-modulated radiotherapy plan. Thereby, the HexaPOD tracking system showed better results than the MLC tracking.""","""['Martin J Menten', 'Matthias Guckenberger', 'Christian Herrmann', 'Andreas Krauß', 'Simeon Nill', 'Uwe Oelfke', 'Jurgen Wilbert']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Electromagnetic guided couch and multileaf collimator tracking on a TrueBeam accelerator.', 'Couch and multileaf collimator tracking: A clinical feasibility study for pancreas and liver treatment.', 'Accuracy of real-time couch tracking during 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy, intensity modulated radiation therapy, and volumetric modulated arc therapy for prostate cancer.', 'An experimentally validated couch and MLC tracking simulator used to investigate hybrid couch-MLC tracking.', 'A review of progress of real-time tumor tracking radiotherapy technology based on dynamic multi-leaf collimator.', 'Real-time intrafraction motion monitoring in external beam radiotherapy.', 'Reducing the tracking drift of an uncontoured tumor for a portal-image-based dynamically adapted conformal radiotherapy treatment.', 'Optimization based trajectory planning for real-time 6DoF robotic patient motion compensation systems.', 'A dosimetric comparison of real-time adaptive and non-adaptive radiotherapy: A multi-institutional study encompassing robotic, gimbaled, multileaf collimator and couch tracking.', 'Image-guided radiotherapy and motion management in lung cancer.']"""

Intraoperative imaging for prostate procedures, usually transrectal ultrasound (TRUS), is typically inferior to diagnostic-quality imaging of the pelvis such as endorectal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MR images contain superior detail of the prostate boundaries and provide substructure features not otherwise visible. Previous efforts to register diagnostic prostate images with the intraoperative coordinate system have been deterministic and did not offer a measure of the registration uncertainty. The authors developed a Bayesian registration method to estimate the posterior distribution on deformations and provide a case-specific measure of the associated registration uncertainty.  Methods:   The authors adapted a biomechanical-based probabilistic nonrigid method to register diagnostic to intraoperative images by aligning a physician's segmentations of the prostate in the two images. The posterior distribution was characterized with a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method; the maximum a posteriori deformation and the associated uncertainty were estimated from the collection of deformation samples drawn from the posterior distribution. The authors validated the registration method using a dataset created from ten patients with MRI-guided prostate biopsies who had both diagnostic and intraprocedural 3 Tesla MRI scans. The accuracy and precision of the estimated posterior distribution on deformations were evaluated from two predictive distance distributions: between the deformed central zone-peripheral zone (CZ-PZ) interface and the physician-labeled interface, and based on physician-defined landmarks. Geometric margins on the registration of the prostate's peripheral zone were determined from the posterior predictive distance to the CZ-PZ interface separately for the base, mid-gland, and apical regions of the prostate.  Results:   The authors observed variation in the shape and volume of the segmented prostate in diagnostic and intraprocedural images. The probabilistic method allowed us to convey registration results in terms of posterior distributions, with the dispersion providing a patient-specific estimate of the registration uncertainty. The median of the predictive distance distribution between the deformed prostate boundary and the segmented boundary was ≤3 mm (95th percentiles within ±4 mm) for all ten patients. The accuracy and precision of the internal deformation was evaluated by comparing the posterior predictive distance distribution for the CZ-PZ interface for each patient, with the median distance ranging from -0.6 to 2.4 mm. Posterior predictive distances between naturally occurring landmarks showed registration errors of ≤5 mm in any direction. The uncertainty was not a global measure, but instead was local and varied throughout the registration region. Registration uncertainties were largest in the apical region of the prostate.  Conclusions:   Using a Bayesian nonrigid registration method, the authors determined the posterior distribution on deformations between diagnostic and intraprocedural MR images and quantified the uncertainty in the registration results. The feasibility of this approach was tested and results were positive. The probabilistic framework allows us to evaluate both patient-specific and location-specific estimates of the uncertainty in the registration result. Although the framework was tested on MR-guided procedures, the preliminary results suggest that it may be applied to TRUS-guided procedures as well, where the addition of diagnostic MR information may have a larger impact on target definition and clinical guidance.""","""['Jennifer Pursley', 'Petter Risholm', 'Andriy Fedorov', 'Kemal Tuncali', 'Fiona M Fennessy', 'William M Wells', 'Clare M Tempany', 'Robert A Cormack']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Prostate CT segmentation method based on nonrigid registration in ultrasound-guided CT-based HDR prostate brachytherapy.', 'Evaluation of three-dimensional finite element-based deformable registration of pre- and intraoperative prostate imaging.', 'Biomechanical modeling constrained surface-based image registration for prostate MR guided TRUS biopsy.', 'Clinical evaluation of an MRI-to-ultrasound deformable image registration algorithm for prostate brachytherapy.', 'The Role of Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Brachytherapy.', 'Value of T1/T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging registration to reduce the postbiopsy hemorrhage effect for prostate cancer localization.', 'Performance comparison of 1.5-T endorectal coil MRI with 3.0-T nonendorectal coil MRI in patients with prostate cancer.', 'Multimodal imaging for improved diagnosis and treatment of cancers.', ""Prostate cancer detection and diagnosis: the role of MR and its comparison with other diagnostic modalities--a radiologist's perspective.""]"""

The aim of this study was to establish a method of immunotherapy for castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) using prostate cancer-specific CTLs generated in vitro by DCs. Monocyte-derived DCs from patients with CRPC were induced to mature using a standard cytokine cocktail (in IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6 and PGE(2) : standard DCs, sDCs) or using an α-type 1-polarized DC (αDC1) cocktail (in IL-1β, TNF-α, IFN-α, IFN-γ and polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid) and loaded with the UVB-irradiated CRPC cell line PC-3. Antigen-loaded DCs were evaluated by morphological and functional assays. The αDC1s significantly increased the expression of several molecules related to DC maturation, regardless of whether the αDC1s were loaded with tumour antigens or not, compared to sDCs. The αDC1s showed a higher production of interleukin-12 both during maturation and after subsequent stimulation with CD40L, which was not significantly affected by loading with tumour antigens, as compared to standard DCs (sDCs). Prostate cancer-specific CTLs against autologous CRPC cells were successfully induced by αDC1s loaded with dying PC-3 cells. Autologous αDC1s loaded with an allogeneic CRPC cell line can generate greater CRPC-specific CTL responses as compared to sDCs and may provide a novel source of DC-based vaccines that can be used for the development of immunotherapy in patients with CRPC.""","""['E C Hwang', 'M-S Lim', 'C-M Im', 'D-D Kwon', 'H-J Lee', 'T-N Nguyen-Pham', 'Y-K Lee', 'J-J Lee']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Scand J Immunol""","""['Generation of potent cytotoxic T lymphocytes against in male patients with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer by dendritic cells loaded with dying T24 bladder cancer cells.', 'Successful cross-presentation of allogeneic myeloma cells by autologous alpha-type 1-polarized dendritic cells as an effective tumor antigen in myeloma patients with matched monoclonal immunoglobulins.', 'Alpha-type 1-polarized dendritic cells loaded with apoptotic allogeneic myeloma cell line induce strong CTL responses against autologous myeloma cells.', 'Advances in specific immunotherapy for prostate cancer.', 'Cancer immunotherapy by fusions of dendritic cells and tumor cells.', 'Generation of potent cytotoxic T lymphocytes against in male patients with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer by dendritic cells loaded with dying T24 bladder cancer cells.', 'Protective effect of Schizandrin B against damage of UVB irradiated skin cells depend on inhibition of inflammatory pathways.', 'Dendritic Cell-Based Cancer Immunotherapy against Multiple Myeloma: From Bench to Clinic.']"""

The calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) is expressed on prostate tumors and may participate in bone metastases development. We assessed whether (i) common genetic variation in CaSR was associated with PCa risk and (ii) these associations varied by calcium intake or plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels.  Methods:   We included 1,193 PCa cases and 1,244 controls nested in the prospective Health Professionals Follow-up Study (1993-2004). We genotyped 18 CaSR single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) to capture common variation. The main outcome was risk of lethal PCa (n = 113); secondary outcomes were overall (n = 1,193) and high-grade PCa (n = 225). We used the kernel machine approach to conduct a gene-level multimarker analysis and unconditional logistic regression to compute per-allele ORs and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for individual SNPs.  Results:   The joint association of SNPs in CaSR was significant for lethal PCa (P = 0.04); this association was stronger in those with low 25(OH)D (P = 0.009). No individual SNPs were associated after considering multiple testing; three SNPs were nominally associated (P < 0.05) with lethal PCa with ORs (95% CI) of 0.65(0.42-0.99): rs6438705; 0.65(0.47-0.89): rs13083990; and 1.55(1.09-2.20): rs2270916.

Methods:   Legumain expression in prostate cancer cell lines was determined by real-time reverse transcriptase PCR and Western blot. Furthermore, legumain expression in 88 prostatectomy specimens was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. The association between legumain expression and clinicopathological factors was analyzed.  Results:   Legumain expression was confirmed at the mRNA and protein levels in all the cells. Although all the cancer tissues were positive for legumain, 2 staining patterns were observed in the cytoplasm: diffuse cytoplasmic and vesicular positivity. The rates of Gleason score ≥8, extracapsular extension, and perineural invasion in the group with vesicular staining were significantly higher than those in the diffuse cytoplasmic group (p < 0.05). The maximum size of the tumor with vesicular staining was significantly greater than that of the tumor with diffuse cytoplasmic staining (p = 0.0302).

However, study results remain inconsistent and contradictory. Using a meta-analytic approach, the present study explore the relationship incorporating more recent studies and provide more powerful evidence without the limitations of any individual study. Relevant studies were identified by searching Pubmed and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials through May 18, 2012. The strength of the relationship between diabetes mellitus and risk of prostate cancer was assessed using relative risk (RR). Either a fixed effects or random effects model was used to calculate the pooled RRs. Stratification analyses and sensitivity analyses were conducted, and publication bias was assessed by Egger's test and Begg's test. Twelve case-control studies involving 9,767 cases and 19,790 controls, and 25 cohort studies involving 118,825 cases were included. The person-years of follow-up ranged from 29,963 to 6,264,890 among included cohort studies. Diabetes was not significantly associated with incidence of prostate cancer in our analysis of case-control studies only (RR = 0.846, 95 % CI [0.710, 1.009]) or that of cohort studies only (RR = 0.925, 95 % CI [0.811, 1.054]). However, through subgroup analyses, statistically significant associations between diabetes and prostate cancer were found when considering population-based studies only (RR = 0.719, 95 % CI [0.637, 0.812]), cohort studies conducted in the United States (RR = 0.789, 95 % CI [0.727, 0.857]), and studies with follow-up of more than 5 years. Compared to risk of prostate cancer among people without diabetes, diabetic patients using insulin treatment experienced reduced incidence of prostate cancer in both case-control and cohort studies. The results suggest that diabetes mellitus is associated with decreased incidence of prostate cancer, specifically in the population of the United States. In addition, the time since onset of diabetes was positively associated with decreasing incidence of prostate cancer. The present conclusions should be considered carefully, however, and confirmed with further studies.""","""['Fan Zhang', 'Yuan Yang', 'Laura Skrip', 'Dayi Hu', 'Yang Wang', 'Chunguang Wong', 'Jingfu Qiu', 'Han Lei']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Acta Diabetol""","""['A meta-analysis of diabetes mellitus and the risk of prostate cancer.', 'Diabetes mellitus as an independent risk factor for lung cancer: a meta-analysis of observational studies.', 'Type 2 diabetes and risk of prostate cancer: a meta-analysis of observational studies.', 'Diabetes mellitus and incidence and mortality of gastric cancer: a meta-analysis.', 'Familial prostate cancer in Sweden.

Materials and methods:   A survey of standard questions used to examine current urinary and sexual function was mailed to 1,500 randomly selected patients from the Utah Cancer Registry who met certain criteria, including prostatectomy for cancer cure more than 1 year previously, current age 70 years or less and no metastatic disease or other cancer therapy. Questionnaire information was linked to cancer registry and hospital discharge abstract information. Hierarchical mixed models were used to examine whether surgeons varied with respect to risk adjusted outcomes.  Results:   The cooperation rate was 64%. Of the 678 qualifying responders 22% reported leaking urine more than once per day, 7% used more than 1 pad per day and 40% reported no erection without medication. Surgeon variation was significant for 3 patient outcomes, including erectile strength, urine leakage and length of hospital stay (each p <0.001). Surgeon risk adjusted erectile outcomes significantly correlated with leakage outcomes (r = 0.84, p <0.0001) and length of stay (r = -0.55, p = 0.0004). Annual surgeon volume significantly correlated with less leakage and shorter length of stay (r = 0.34 and -0.36, respectively, each p = 0.05). Compared to open retropubic surgery, robotic surgery was associated with a shorter stay. The perineal approach was associated with shorter stay, less urine leakage and weaker erection.

Therefore, they are envisioned as a treatment for urinary incontinence after radical prostatectomy. However, to our knowledge the safety of this treatment and the interaction of myoblasts with any remaining neighboring cancer are unknown. We investigated the interactions between myoblasts and prostate carcinoma cells in vitro and in vivo.  Materials and methods:   Myoblasts isolated from the rectus abdominis were used in a series of co-culture experiments with prostate cancer cells and subcutaneously co-injected in vivo. Cell proliferation, cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of cancer in co-culture with myoblasts were assessed. Tumor volume and metastasis formation were evaluated in a mouse model. Tissue specific markers were assessed by immunohistochemistry, fluorescence activated cell sorting analysis, Western blot and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction.  Results:   Myoblasts in proximity to tumor provided paracrine tumor necrosis factor-α to their microenvironment, decreasing the tumor growth of all prostate cancer cell lines examined. Co-culture experiments revealed induction of cell cycle arrest, tumor death by apoptosis and increased myoblast differentiation. This effect was largely blocked by tumor necrosis factor-α inhibition. The same outcome was noted in a mouse model, in which co-injected human myoblasts also inhibited the tumor growth and metastasis formation of all prostate cancer cell lines evaluated.

Objective:   We tested the impact of ART on cancer-specific mortality (CSM) and overall mortality (OM) in PCa patients according to pathologic PCa features.  Design, setting, and participants:   We evaluated 1049 PCa patients treated with RP and extended pelvic lymph node dissection alone or in combination with adjuvant treatments between 1998 and 2008. All patients had positive surgical margins and/or pT3/pT4 disease with or without positive lymph nodes.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Cox regression analyses tested the relationship between pathologic characteristics and CSM rates. Independent predictors of survival were used to develop a novel risk score based on the number of risk factors. Finally, Cox regression models tested the relationship between ART and survival according to the number of risk factors.  Results and limitations:   On multivariable analyses, only pathologic Gleason score ≥ 8, pT3b/T4 stage, and presence of positive lymph nodes represented independent predictors of CSM (all p ≤ 0.02). The cumulative number of these pathologic findings was used to develop a risk score, which was 0, 1, 2, and 3 in 43.6%, 22.1%, 20.7%, and 13.6% of patients, respectively. In patients sharing more than two mentioned predictors of CSM (primarily having a risk score of 0 or 1), ART did not significantly improve survival (all p ≥ 0.4). Conversely, in patients with a risk score ≥ 2, ART was associated with lower CSM and OM rates (all p=0.006). The observational nature of the cohort represents a limitation of the study.

The special feature of an MRMC receiver-operating characteristic study requires that the same set of patients' images be examined by the same set of doctors. One main difficulty of analyzing MRMC data is a complicated correlation structure. Four commonly used methods are available for dealing with this complicated correlation structure. The authors conducted an extensive simulation study to assess the performance of these methods in finite sample sizes. They summarize the relative strengths and weaknesses of these methods and make recommendations on the use of these methods.  Materials and methods:   A comprehensive simulation study was conducted to assess finite-sample performance of these methods with continuous data. The use of these methods for magnetic resonance imaging to predict extracapsular extension of prostate gland tumors is also illustrated.  Results:   The results indicate that when test outcomes are continuous, all four methods perform well for estimating the difference in areas under the curves for two diagnostic tests.

The normal and pathological growth of the prostate are both dependent on stimulation by dihydrotestosterone, which is synthesized from circulating testosterone by two 5α-reductase (5α-R) isozymes, 5α-reductase type 1 (5α-R1) and 5α-reductase type 2 (5α-R2). Both isozymes have been implicated in prostate disease. We used quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry, respectively, to quantify mRNA and protein levels of 5α-R isozymes in the ventral prostate of adult rats under environmental stress conditions analogous to those found in some common workplace situations, i.e. artificial light, excessive heat, and the sensation of immobility in a small space. Transcription and expression levels of both 5α-R isozymes were significantly higher in environmentally stressed rats than in unstressed rats. Increased 5α-R isozyme levels may play a role in the development or maintenance of prostate disease.

This method showed a linearity of 1-1000ng/mL in both mouse and human plasma with a lower limit of quantification of 1ng/mL. The within-day and between-day coefficient of variation ranged from 1.18 to 11.8% and accuracy from 92 to 110%. The method was applied to characterize the pharmacokinetics of PCA in mice after oral administration of 50mg/kg PCA. PCA was absorbed rapidly with a half-life of 2.9min, reached a peak plasma level (C(max)) of 73.6μM at 5min, and remained detectable up to 8h with the initial elimination half-life of about 3min and a terminal half-life of 16min. The area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC(0→8h)) of PCA was 1456μMmin. The method was capable of detecting low ng/mL quantities of PCA in the plasma of patients with prostate cancer after an oral ingestion of 60g of black raspberry (BRB) powder.

It occurs in 0.5% to 32% of men after open radical retropubic prostatectomy (RRP), although its etiology is poorly understood. In a series of patients who received RRP, we analyzed the incidence, possible predisposing factors, and management of AS after RP.  Materials & methods:   Between April 1997 and March 2006, 129 consecutive patients underwent RRP in our hospital. Anastomosis between the bladder neck and urethra was performed with interrupted anastomosis using four 2-0 absorbable sutures. AS was diagnosed when a 16Fr. panendoscope could not be passed. We assessed the relationship between the management method for AS and time interval between the surgical procedure and diagnosis of the stricture. The relationships between comorbidities identified preoperatively (hypertension [HT], diabetes mellitus [DM], cardiovascular disease [CVD], cerebral infarction [CI] and smoking history) and the incidence of AS were determined. Risk factors, including age, body mass index [BMI], preoperative PSA, total prostate volume, operative time, blood loss, Foley duration, amount of stress urinary incontinence (SUI) per day, amount of drain output, pathological T stage, Gleason sum and surgical margin status were also assessed.  Results:   The rate of AS after RRP was 10.9% (14/129). In 10 patients (72%), AS occurred within 3 months of surgery, in 2 (14%) it occurred at 4-12 months after surgery and in 2 (14%) more than 12 months after surgery. In univariate and multivariate analyses, intraoperative bleeding of 1,800 ml or more was independently the strongest predictor of AS. In two patients a urethral bougie was used and 11 underwent internal urethrotomy. Only 1 patient underwent transurethral resection. Of the 8 patients whose strictures were diagnosed within 3 months after surgery and underwent internal urethrotomy, 6 had recurrent anastomotic strictures.  Conclusions:   Risk factors for AS are thought to be multifactorial. Intraoperative blood loss was significantly associated with the development of anastomotic stricture. We should understand that anastomotic stricture following radical retropubic prostatectomy is not a rare morbidity and should inform patients about the possibility of postoperative AS.""","""['Takashi Shimizu', 'Atsushi Takahashi', 'Koji Ichihara', 'Nobuo Shinkai', 'Tatsuru Ikeda', 'Masanori Nojima', 'Yoshio Takagi']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Nihon Hinyokika Gakkai Zasshi""","""['Treatment of recurrent vesicourethral anastomotic stricture after radical prostatectomy using plasma-button vaporization.', 'Single center comparison of anastomotic strictures after radical perineal and radical retropubic prostatectomy.', 'Vesicourethral anastomotic strictures after radical retropubic prostatectomy: the experience of a single institution.', 'Management of Urethral Stricture and Bladder Neck Contracture Following Primary and Salvage Treatment of Prostate Cancer.', 'Stricture of the vesicourethral anastomosis after radical prostatectomy.', 'Transperineal reanastomosis for treatment of highly recurrent anastomotic strictures after radical retropubic prostatectomy: extended follow-up.', 'A new technique of bladder neck reconstruction during radical prostatectomy in patients with prostate cancer.']"""

Out of these 353 patients in the BT group, 305 patients received neoadjuvant hormone therapy (BT NHT + group), while 48 did not (BT NHT - group). SF was prospectively evaluated using the UCLA Prostate Cancer Index (UCLA-PCI). Potency was defined as the UCLA-PCI Q26 point of > or = 3.  Result:   The preimplant UCLA-PCI scores of SF for BT NHT - and BT NHT + groups were 50.9 and 13.4, respectively. The SF score of the NHT - group post operatively decreased to 38.9 within 6 months, but was maintained at the same level after that. With the recovery of the androgen, SF score of the NHT + group improved after BT: however, it did not reach up to that of the NHT - group. In the univariate analysis, patient's age was the only predictive factor for SF after BT. Thirty-four out of 48 patients in the BT NHT - group and 23 out of 56 patients in the RRP group showed adequate potency before surgery. Their 5-year potency preservation rate was 73.6% in the BT NHT - group and 4.3% in the RRP group.

Such putative stem cell populations are thought to proliferate slowly, but possess unlimited proliferative potential. Based on this, we hypothesized that CD133(pos) prostate cancer cells proliferate slower than CD133(neg) cells.  Methods:   Human prostate cancer cell lines were analyzed for CD133 expression and DNA content using flow cytometry. Rates of cell division and DNA synthesis were determined using CFSE cell tracing and BrdU uptake, respectively. Changes in cell cycle distribution and the percentage of CD133(pos) cells were assayed under conditions of different cell density and AR-pathway modulation. Lastly, we over-expressed lentiviral CD133 to measure whether CD133 regulates the cell cycle.  Results:   The cell cycle distribution differs between CD133(pos) and CD133(neg) cells in all three human prostate cancer cell lines studied. CD133(pos) cells have a greater proportion of cells in G2 and proliferate faster than CD133(neg) cells. High cell density increases the percentage of CD133(pos) cells without changing CD133(pos) cell cycle progression. Treatment with the AR agonist R1881, or the anti-androgen MDV3100, significantly changed the percentage and proliferation of CD133(pos) cells. Finally, ectopic over-expression of CD133 had no effect on cell cycle progression.  Conclusions:   Contrary to our hypothesis, we demonstrate that CD133(pos) cells proliferate faster than CD133(neg) cells.

We examined whether NEP expression is regulated by hypoxia, frequently encountered in the tumor microenvironment.  Methods:   NEP expression was compared in prostate cancer cell lines cultured in normoxic and hypoxic conditions. The NEP activity, protein levels, and mRNA levels were determined using enzyme assay, Western blotting and q-PCR analysis, respectively. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay (ChIP) was used to confirm the negative regulation of NEP at the transcriptional level by hypoxia responsive elements (HREs).  Results:   The results indicate that NEP expression was inhibited under hypoxic conditions in the NEP positive LNCaP, C4-2, and 22RV1 cells and human umbilical vascular endothelial (HUVEC) cells. NEP regulation appeared to be predominantly at the transcriptional level as NEP mRNA expression significantly reduced with hypoxia, concordant with the kinetics of protein levels, and NEP enzyme activity. A search of the NEP gene sequence revealed three putative HREs upstream of the NEP promoter. Two of the HREs demonstrated a specific reduction of shift in the presence of cobalt chloride; specificity of the binding sites was confirmed by ChIP.

We hypothesized that combining the direct oncolytic and antiangiogenic activities of the interleukin (IL)-12-secreting NV1042 oHSV with microtubule disrupting agents (MDAs) would be an effective means to enhance antitumor efficacy. Vinblastine (VB) was identified among several MDAs screened, which displayed consistent and potent cytotoxic killing of both prostate cancer and endothelial cell lines. In matrigel tube-forming assays, VB was found to be highly effective at inhibiting tube formation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells. The combination of VB with NV1023 (the parental virus lacking IL-12) or NV1042 showed additive or synergistic activity against prostate cancer cell lines, and was not due to increased oHSV replication by VB. In athymic mice bearing CWR22 prostate tumors, VB in combination with NV1042 was superior to the combination of VB plus NV1023 in reducing tumor burden, appeared to be nontoxic and resulted in a statistically significant diminution in the number of CD31(+) cells as compared with other treatment groups.

On the basis of previous findings, cyclic Arg-Gly-Asp (cRGD) peptides were conjugated to NPs to recognize the target site, integrin αvβ3, expressed in high levels in PC-3 prostate cancer cells. The suppression of angiogenesis by the downregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression has been widely used to inhibit the growth of malignant tumors. In our study, human VEGF (hVEGF)-siRNA was encapsulated in NPs to inhibit VEGF expression in PC-3 cells. Concurrently, sonoporation induced by ultrasound-targeted microbubble destruction (UTMD) was utilized for the delivery of siRNA-loaded NPs. Our results showed low cytotoxicity and high gene transfection efficiency, demonstrating that the targeted delivery of biodegradable NPs with UTMD may be potentially applied as new vector system for gene delivery.""","""['Yun-Hua Li', 'Qiu-Sheng Shi', 'Jing Du', 'Li-Fang Jin', 'Lian-Fang Du', 'Pei-Feng Liu', 'You-Rong Duan']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Int J Mol Med""","""['Enhanced delivery of monomethoxypoly(ethylene glycol)-poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)-poly l-lysine nanoparticles loading platelet-derived growth factor BB small interfering RNA by ultrasound and/or microbubbles to rat retinal pigment epithelium cells.', 'Enhanced delivery of PEAL nanoparticles with ultrasound targeted microbubble destruction mediated siRNA transfection in human MCF-7/S and MCF-7/ADR cells in vitro.', 'Biodegradable nanoparticles of mPEG-PLGA-PLL triblock copolymers as novel non-viral vectors for improving siRNA delivery and gene silencing.', 'Lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles as a new generation therapeutic delivery platform: a review.', 'Gene therapy for ocular diseases meditated by ultrasound and microbubbles (Review).', 'Basic Research on Tendon Repair: Strategies, Evaluation, and Development.', 'Targeted Delivery of siRNA Therapeutics to Malignant Tumors.', 'Biomaterial-Guided Gene Delivery for Musculoskeletal Tissue Repair.', 'Polymer nanoparticles for drug and small silencing RNA delivery to treat cancers of different phenotypes.']"""

Methods:   PZ prostate tumours were retrospectively annotated on multiparametric MR series using prostatectomy specimens as reference standard. Tumours were grouped based on homogeneous and heterogeneous apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values using an automated ADC texture analysis method. The proportion of heterogeneous tumours containing a distinct, high Gleason grade tumour focus yielding low ADC values was determined. Both overall tumour and high-grade focal volumes were calculated. All high-grade target volumes were then used in a simulated US biopsy system with adjustable accuracy to determine the hit rate.  Results:   An ADC-determined high-grade tumour focus was found in 63 % of the PZ prostate tumours. The focal volumes were significantly smaller than the total tumour volumes (median volume of 0.3 ml and 1.1 ml respectively). To correctly grade 95 % of the aggressive tumour components the target registration error (TRE) should be smaller than 1.9 mm.  Conclusions:   To enable finding the high Gleason grade component in 95 % of PZ prostate tumours with MR-guided US biopsies, a technical registration accuracy of 1.9 mm is required.  Key points:   • MRI can identify foci of prostatic cancer with reduced apparent diffusion coefficients • Sixty-three per cent of prostatic peripheral zone tumours contain high-grade tumour low ADC foci • The median volume of such foci is 0.3 ml • Biopsy targets are significantly smaller than whole tumour volumes • Simulated registration accuracy is 1.9 mm for correctly grading 95 % of tumours.""","""['Wendy J M van de Ven', 'Christina A Hulsbergen-van de Kaa', 'Thomas Hambrock', 'Jelle O Barentsz', 'Henkjan J Huisman']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Eur Radiol""","""['Relationship between T2 relaxation and apparent diffusion coefficient in malignant and non-malignant prostate regions and the effect of peripheral zone fractional volume.', 'Diagnostic evaluation of magnetization transfer and diffusion kurtosis imaging for prostate cancer detection in a re-biopsy population.', 'Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging in the prostate transition zone: histopathological validation using magnetic resonance-guided biopsy specimens.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Value of multiparametric MRI in the work-up of prostate cancer.', 'More than Meets the Eye: Using Textural Analysis and Artificial Intelligence as Decision Support Tools in Prostate Cancer Diagnosis-A Systematic Review.', 'Label-driven magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) registration using weakly supervised learning for MRI-guided prostate radiotherapy.', 'Automatic segmentation of prostate MRI using convolutional neural networks: Investigating the impact of network architecture on the accuracy of volume measurement and MRI-ultrasound registration.', 'How to implement magnetic resonance imaging before prostate biopsy in clinical practice: nomograms for saving biopsies.', 'Open Source Platform for Transperineal In-Bore MRI-Guided Targeted Prostate Biopsy.']"""

Patients and methods:   Fifty-six patients with incidental prostate cancer were included and the age ranged from 66 to 91 years (mean, 76.6; median, 75.0). Preoperative prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels were between 0.70 and 44.1 ng/mL (mean, 5.90; median, 4.60). We performed 69 RTUR-PCa's by resecting and fulgurating the residual prostate tissues after previous transurethral resection of the prostate. Prostate specific antigen nonrecurrence rate was calculated by Kaplan-Meier method.  Results:   Follow-up duration of 51 patients was mean ± SD 64.1 ± 21.6 months (median, 67.8 months; range, 13.8-99.8) excluding 5 patients that were lost to follow-up. Prostate specific antigen failure developed in 3 patients (5.9%). In the other 48 patients, PSA stabilized as follows: PSA ≤ 0.01, 24 cases; ≤ 0.02, 5 cases; ≤ 0.03, 6 cases; ≤ 0.04, 3 cases; ≤ 0.1, 7 cases; and ≤ 0.4, 3 cases. Prostate specific antigen nonrecurrence rates were 100% for pT2a and 91.3% for pT2b at the mean follow-up period of 64.1 months. Nonrecurrence rate grouped by D'Amico classification system were 100% in the low-risk group, 94.7% in the intermediate-risk group, and 88.2% in the high-risk group, respectively. Water intoxication did not develop and no patients required transfusion. Bladder neck contracture, which developed in 22 out of 51 patients (43.1%), was the most frequent postoperative complication.

Chemoprevention, a prophylactic approach that uses nontoxic natural or synthetic compounds to reverse, inhibit, or prevent cancer by targeting specific steps in the carcinogenic pathway, is gaining traction among health care practitioners. Soy isoflavones and curcumin, staples of the Asian diet, have shown promise as functional factors for the chemoprevention of prostate cancer because of their ability to modulate multiple intracellular signaling pathways, including cellular proliferation, apoptosis, inflammation, and androgen receptor signaling. Recent evidence has revealed the DNA damage response (DDR) to be one of the earliest events in the multistep progression of human epithelial carcinomas to invasive malignancy.

We set out to reduce the pro-tumorigenic activity of patient CAFs using the Dlk1 and SCUBE1 molecules that we had previously identified in prostate development. Our hypothesis was that mesenchymally expressed molecules might reduce CAF pro-tumorigenic activity, either directly or indirectly. We isolated primary prostatic CAFs and characterised their expression of CAF markers, expression of Notch2, Dlk1 and SCUBE1 transcripts, and confirmed their ability to stimulate BPH1 epithelial cell proliferation. Next, we expressed Dlk1 or SCUBE1 in CAFs and determined their effects upon tumorigenesis in vivo following recombination with BPH1 epithelia and xenografting in SCID mice. Tumour size was reduced by about 75% and BPH1 proliferation was reduced by about 50% after expression of Dlk1 or SCUBE1 in CAFs, and there was also a reduction in invasion of BPH1 epithelia into the host kidney. Inhibition of Notch signalling, using inhibitor XIX, led to a reduction in BPH1 cell proliferation in CAF-BPH1 co-cultures, whereas inhibition of Dlk1 in NIH3T3-conditioned media led to an increase in BPH1 growth.

Methods:   Semistructured in-person interviews were conducted with 21 men (14 black; 7 white) with recently diagnosed localized prostate cancer.  Results:   All cancers were detected by prostate-specific antigen screening; 14 men had low-risk disease. Nineteen chose surgery or radiation treatment. The majority wanted to ""get rid of"" or ""cure"" the cancer by undergoing aggressive therapy, even with awareness of the potential for significant side effects. Most men seemed unaware of the uncertainty/controversies that aggressive treatment may not cure their cancer or improve their survival. Limited knowledge about WW/AS was common, and few remembered WW/AS being presented as a viable option. Rather, many men perceived it as ""doing nothing."" Some men, who initially were inclined toward WW/AS, yielded to pressure from family, physicians, or both to choose aggressive treatment. Lack of physician support was a significant barrier to WW/AS.  Conclusions:   The observational strategy (WW/AS) was not viewed as a reasonable approach, even for those with low-risk cancer. The desire for aggressive therapy may reflect the complex psychology associated with receiving a diagnosis of cancer and the limited supportive counseling received.

Recent studies have revealed the immense biomarker capacity of microRNAs (miRNAs) in prostate cancer. The aim of this study was to analyze the expression pattern of miR-224, a cancer-related miRNA, in prostate tumors and investigate its clinical utility.  Methods:   Total RNA was isolated from 139 prostate tissue samples. After the polyadenylation of total RNA by poly(A) polymerase, cDNA was synthesized with a suitable poly(T) adapter. miR-224 expression was assessed by quantitative real-time PCR and analyzed with the comparative quantification cycle method, C(q)(2(-ΔΔCq)). We performed comprehensive biostatistical analyses to explore the clinical value of miR-224 in prostate cancer.  Results:   miR-224 expression was significantly downregulated in malignant samples compared with benign samples (P < 0.001). Higher miR-224 expression levels were found in prostate tumors that were less aggressive (P = 0.017) and in an earlier disease stage (P = 0.018). Patients with prostate cancer who were positive for miR-224 had significantly enhanced progression-free survival intervals compared with miR-224-negative patients (P = 0.021). Univariate bootstrap Cox regression confirmed that miR-224 was associated with favorable prognosis (hazard ratio 0.314, P = 0.013); nonetheless, multivariate analysis, adjusted for conventional markers, did not identify miR-224 as an independent prognostic indicator.  Conclusions:   miR-224 is aberrantly expressed in prostate cancer.

Experimental design:   This double-blinded phase II study randomized (1:1:1) patients with progressive, taxane-refractory CRPC to receive MP (12 mg/m(2) i.v. day 1, 5 mg twice a day orally days 1-21, respectively) plus 15 mg/kg rilotumumab, 7.5 mg/kg rilotumumab, or placebo (i.v. day 1) every 3 weeks. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS).  Results:   One hundred and forty-four patients were randomized. Median OS was 12.2 versus 11.1 months [HR, 1.10; 80% confidence interval (CI), 0.82-1.48] in the combined rilotumumab versus control arms. Median progression-free survival was 3.0 versus 2.9 months (HR, 1.02; 80% CI, 0.79-1.31). Treatment appeared well tolerated with peripheral edema (24% vs. 8%) being more common with rilotumumab. A trend toward unfavorable OS was observed in patients with high tumor MET expression regardless of treatment. Soluble MET levels increased in all treatment arms. Total HGF levels increased in the rilotumumab arms. Rilotumumab showed linear pharmacokinetics when co-administered with MP.

The impact of minimizing assistant/surgeon tension on urinary function has not been quantified. We assess urinary function after attenuating neurovascular bundle (NVB) and rhabdosphincter tension during robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP).  Methods:   Retrospective study of prospectively collected data for 268 (RARP-T) versus 342 (RARP-0T) men with versus without tension on the NVB and rhabdosphincter during RARP. Outcomes compared include Expanded Prostate Cancer Index (EPIC) urinary function, estimated blood loss (EBL), operative time, and positive surgical margins (PSM).  Results:   In unadjusted analysis, men undergoing RARP-T versus RARP-0T were older, had higher biopsy and pathologic Gleason grade, and higher preoperative prostate specific antigen (all p ≤ 0.023). Baseline urinary function was similar. Postoperatively, RARP-0T versus RARP-T was associated with higher 5-month urinary function scores (69.7 versus 64, p = 0.049). In adjusted analyses, RARP-0T versus RARP-T was associated with improved 5-month urinary function [Parameter Estimate (PE) 7.37, Standard Error (SE) 2.67, p = 0.006], while bilateral versus non-/unilateral nerve-sparing was associated with improved 12-month urinary function and continence (both p ≤ 0.035). RARP-0T versus RARP-T was associated with shorter operative times (PE 6.66, SE 1.90, p = 0.001) and higher EBL (PE 20.88, SE 6.49, p = 0.001). There were no significant differences in PSM.  Conclusions:   While the use of tension aids in dissection of anatomic planes, avoidance of NVB counter-traction and minimizing tension on the rhabdosphincter during apical dissection attenuates neuropraxia and leads to earlier urinary function recovery. Bilateral versus non-/unilateral nerve-sparing also improves urinary function recovery.""","""['Keith J Kowalczyk', 'Andy C Huang', 'Nathanael D Hevelone', 'Stuart R Lipsitz', 'Hua-yin Yu', 'John H Lynch', 'Jim C Hu']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""World J Urol""","""['Stepwise approach for nerve sparing without countertraction during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: technique and outcomes.', 'Retzius-sparing Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy Leads to Durable Improvement in Urinary Function and Quality of Life Versus Standard Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy Without Compromise on Oncologic Efficacy: Single-surgeon Series and Step-by-step Guide.', 'Independent predictors of recovery of continence 3 months after robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.', 'Comparison of perioperative, functional, and oncologic outcomes between standard laparoscopic and robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy: a systemic review and meta-analysis.', 'Systematic review and meta-analysis of studies reporting urinary continence recovery after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', ""Preservation of continence in radical prostatectomy patients: a laparoscopic surgeon's perspective."", 'The value of periprostatic fascia thickness and fascia preservation as prognostic factors of erectile function after nerve-sparing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.']"""

We analyzed the expression of epigenetics-related genes via a clustering analysis based on gene function in moderately and poorly differentiated PCa glands compared to normal glands of the peripheral zone (prostate proper) from PCa patients using Whole Human Genome Oligo Microarrays. Our analysis identified 12 epigenetics-related genes with a more than 2-fold increase or decrease in expression and a p-value <0.01. In modera-tely differentiated tumors compared to normal glands of the peripheral zone, we found the genes, TDRD1, IGF2, DICER1, ADARB1, HILS1, GLMN and TRIM27, to be upregulated, whereas TNRC6A and DGCR8 were found to be downregulated. In poorly differentiated tumors, we found TDRD1, ADARB and RBM3 to be upregulated, whereas DGCR8, PIWIL2 and BC069781 were downregulated. Our analysis of the expression level for each gene in the metastatic androgen-sensitive VCaP and LNCaP, and -insensitive PC3 and DU-145 PCa cell lines revealed differences in expression among the cell lines which may reflect the different biological properties of each cell line, and the potential role of each gene at different metastatic sites. The novel epigenetics-related genes that we identified in primary PCa tissues may provide further insight into the role that epigenetic changes play in PCa. Moreover, some of the genes that we identified may play important roles in primary PCa and metastasis, in primary PCa only, or in metastasis only.

Blood fatty acids are correlated through shared food sources and common endogenous desaturation and elongation pathways. Studies of individual fatty acids cannot take this into account, but pattern analysis can. Treelet transform (TT) is a novel method that uses data correlation structures to derive sparse factors that explain variation.  Objective:   The objective was to gain further insight in the association between plasma fatty acids and risk of prostate cancer by applying TT to take data correlations into account.  Design:   We reanalyzed previously published data from a case-control study of prostate cancer nested within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) cohort. TT was used to derive factors explaining the variation in 26 plasma phospholipid fatty acids of 962 incident prostate cancer cases matched to 1061 controls. Multiple imputation was used to deal with missing data in covariates. ORs of prostate cancer according to factor scores were determined by using multivariable conditional logistic regression.

Objective:   Our objective was to examine the associations between dietary intakes of carbohydrates, fiber, and their food sources and risk of prostate cancer, overall and by case severity, in the Malmö Diet and Cancer cohort.  Design:   The analysis included 8128 men aged 45-73 y without a history of cancer, cardiovascular disease, or diabetes and who were classified as adequate energy reporters. After a median follow-up time of 15 y, prostate cancer was diagnosed in 817 men. We used Cox proportional hazards regression to model associations between energy-adjusted nutrient and food intakes with risk of incident prostate cancer, with competing risk of death from non-prostate cancer causes taken into account.  Results:   After adjustment for age and other known or potential risk factors, we observed no associations between total carbohydrates or dietary fiber and prostate cancer. We observed positive associations between the intake of low-fiber cereals with overall and low-risk prostate cancer and between intakes of cake and biscuits and rice and pasta with low-risk prostate cancer (all P-trend < 0.05). A high intake compared with zero consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages was associated with increased risk of symptomatic prostate cancer (HR: 1.38; 95% CI: 1.04, 1.84).  Conclusions:   Results from this large study with high-validity dietary data suggest that a high intake of refined carbohydrates may be associated with increased risk of prostate cancer.

Here, we report on anticancer activity of C-PC that was isolated from the novel cyanobacterium Limnothrix sp. 37-2-1. C-PC from this organism exhibited anticancer properties in our in vitro systems; however, the required doses were well above the range of anticancer drugs normally used. Therefore, we conducted several experiments to test whether lower-than-usual doses of the anticancer drug topotecan (TPT) can offer the same level of cytotoxic effects as normal doses when combined with C-PC. For this purpose, cytotoxicities of C-PC and TPT were tested using the LNCaP (prostate cancer) cells. We found that when only 10% of a typical dose of TPT was combined with C-PC, the cancer cells were killed at a higher rate than when TPT was used alone at full dose. Similarly, we were also able to detect an increased level of radical oxygen species (ROS) generation as well as an increase in activities of caspase-9 and caspase-3 when these two compounds were used in combination. Taken together, our findings suggest that combining C-PC from Limnothrix sp. with the lower dose of TPT can induce apoptosis through generation of ROS and activation of caspases. In that respect, we suggest that C-PC can potentially improve the efficacy of the currently available anticancer drug, and therefore diminish its harsh side effects in the patient.""","""['Miroslav Gantar', 'Sivanesan Dhandayuthapani', 'Appu Rathinavelu']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""J Med Food""","""['Molecular mechanism of C-phycocyanin induced apoptosis in LNCaP cells.', 'C-phycocyanin from Limnothrix Species KNUA002 Alleviates Cisplatin-Induced Ototoxicity by Blocking the Mitochondrial Apoptotic Pathway in Auditory Cells.', 'The synergistic antitumor effects of all-trans retinoic acid and C-phycocyanin on the lung cancer A549 cells in vitro and in vivo.', 'Potential Therapeutic Applications of C-Phycocyanin.', 'Medical Application of Spirulina platensis Derived C-Phycocyanin.', 'A comprehensive review on algal nutraceuticals as prospective therapeutic agent for different diseases.', 'Microalgae in Terms of Biomedical Technology: Probiotics, Prebiotics, and Metabiotics.', 'Therapeutic Potential of Marine Peptides in Prostate Cancer: Mechanistic Insights.', 'Phycobiliproteins-A Family of Algae-Derived Biliproteins: Productions, Characterization and Pharmaceutical Potentials.', 'Physicochemical degradation of phycocyanin and means to improve its stability: A short review.']"""

The molecular mechanisms of the oncogenic signaling pathway(s) that are involved in prostate carcinogenesis play a crucial role in disease progression and persistence. There is an important role of signal transducer and activator of transcriptions (STATs) particularly STAT-3 and STAT-5 and its negative regulator suppressor of cytokine signaling-1 (SOCS-1).  Methods:   In the present study, the expression and localization of STAT and SOCS-1 proteins in prostate cancer by immunohistochemistry in a total of 150 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded human prostate tissues of different grade obtained by radical prostatectomies or transurethral resection.  Results:   A significantly strong STAT-3 expression pattern in 68% (65/95) prostate cancer cases as compared to 12% (5/55) in benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) controls (P < 0.001) was observed. Interestingly the SOCS-1 expression was found to be significantly elevated in prostate cancer cases (P < 0.001).  Conclusions:   The present study demonstrates overexpression of STAT-3 and STAT-5 proteins and a contrasting role of SOCS-1 in prostate cancer. These results suggest a critical association between altered expression of STAT-3 and STAT-5 with SOCS-1 and indicate its potential role as a negative regulator independent of JAK-STAT pathway in tumorigenic transformation of prostate tissue.

Se is incorporated into 25 selenoproteins. The aim of this work was to assess whether risk of prostate cancer is affected by genetic variants in genes coding for selenoproteins, either alone or in combination with Se status. 248 cases and 492 controls from an EPIC-Heidelberg nested case-control study were subjected to two-stage genotyping with an initial screening phase in which 384 tagging-SNPs covering 72 Se-related genes were determined in 94 cases and 94 controls using the Illumina Goldengate methodology. This analysis was followed by a second phase in which genotyping for candidate SNPs identified in the first phase was carried out in the full study using Sequenom. Risk of high-grade or advanced stage prostate cancer was modified by interactions between serum markers of Se status and genotypes for rs9880056 in SELK, rs9605030 and rs9605031 in TXNRD2, and rs7310505 in TXNRD1. No significant effects of SNPs on prostate cancer risk were observed when grade or Se status was not taken into account. In conclusion, the risk of high-grade or advanced-stage prostate cancer is significantly altered by a combination of genotype for SNPs in selenoprotein genes and Se status. The findings contribute to explaining the biological effects of selenium intake and genetic factors in prostate cancer development and highlight potential roles of thioredoxin reductases and selenoprotein K in tumour progression.""","""['Catherine Méplan', 'Sabine Rohrmann', 'Astrid Steinbrecher', 'Lutz Schomburg', 'Eugène Jansen', 'Jakob Linseisen', 'John Hesketh']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Association of Selenoprotein and Selenium Pathway Genotypes with Risk of Colorectal Cancer and Interaction with Selenium Status.', 'Association of genetic variations of selenoprotein genes, plasma selenium levels, and prostate cancer aggressiveness at diagnosis.', 'Expression of Selenoprotein Genes and Association with Selenium Status in Colorectal Adenoma and Colorectal Cancer.', 'Selenium and cancer: a story that should not be forgotten-insights from genomics.', 'Selenium, selenoproteins and human health: a review.', 'Selenium, Stroke, and Infection: A Threefold Relationship; Where Do We Stand and Where Do We Go?', 'Integrated Analysis to Study the Relationship between Tumor-Associated Selenoproteins: Focus on Prostate Cancer.', 'The Interaction between Dietary Selenium Intake and Genetics in Determining Cancer Risk and Outcome.', 'Epitranscriptomic systems regulate the translation of reactive oxygen species detoxifying and disease linked selenoproteins.', 'Association of Selenoprotein and Selenium Pathway Genotypes with Risk of Colorectal Cancer and Interaction with Selenium Status.']"""

Regulation of AR homeostasis in prostate tumorigenesis has not yet been fully characterized. In this study, we demonstrate that p21-activated kinase 6 (PAK6) inhibits prostate tumorigenesis by regulating AR homeostasis. First, we demonstrated that in normal prostate epithelium, AR co-localizes with PAK6 in the cytoplasm and translocates into the nucleus in malignant prostate. Furthermore, AR phosphorylation at Ser-578 by PAK6 promotes AR-E3 ligase murine double minute-2 (Mdm2) association, causing AR degradation upon androgen stimuli. We also showed that PAK6 phosphorylates Mdm2 on Thr-158 and Ser-186, which is critical for AR ubiquitin-mediated degradation. Moreover, we found that Thr-158 collaborates with Ser-186 for AR-Mdm2 association and AR ubiquitin-mediated degradation as it facilitates PAK6-mediated AR homeostasis. PAK6 knockdown promotes prostate tumor growth in vivo. Interestingly, we found a strong inverse correlation between PAK6 and AR expression in the cytoplasm of prostate cancer cells.

STX2171 is a novel selective non-steroidal 17β-HSD3 inhibitor with an IC(50) of ∼200 nM in a whole-cell assay. It inhibits adione-stimulated proliferation of 17β-HSD3-expressing androgen receptor-positive LNCaP(HSD3) prostate cancer cells in vitro.

One week after switching the stimulus to adione, mice were dosed additionally with the vehicle or inhibitor for a further 4 weeks. Both TP and adione efficiently stimulated tumour growth and increased plasma testosterone levels; however, in the presence of either 17β-HSD3 inhibitor, adione-dependent tumour growth was significantly inhibited and plasma testosterone levels reduced. Mouse body weights were unaffected. Both inhibitors also significantly lowered plasma testosterone levels in intact mice.

Methods:   PTOV1 and Ki67 were immunohistochemically evaluated in PCa, atypical adenomatous hyperplasia (AAH), high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN), and normal-looking epithelium (NEp) of the transition zone (TZ) in 40 radical prostatectomies with pT2a Gleason score 6 PCa (20 with AAH and 20 with HGPIN) and in 10 simple prostatectomies (SPs) (5 with AAH and 5 with HGPIN).

Logistic regression modeling was conducted to analyze potential demographic, health services, and treatment-related variables' influences on receipt of advanced RT.  Results:   Among the 19,161 (29.7%) patients who received radiation therapy, there was a significant decrease in the proportion of patients who received the simplest radiation technique (ie, 2D-radiation therapy) (P < .0001), and significant increases in the proportions of patients receiving more advanced radiation techniques (ie, IMRT, and SRS; P < .0001 for all curves); although the rates for use of IMRT and SRS in 2007 remained under 5%.

Experimental studies have indicated that they may be important regulators of tumor invasion and metastasis, and high expression of the tetraspanin CD151 has been linked to poor prognosis in a number of cancers. Here, we show for the first time that genetic ablation of CD151 inhibits spontaneous metastasis in a transgenic mouse model of de novo tumorigenesis. To evaluate the effects of CD151 on de novo prostate cancer initiation and metastasis, a Cd151(-/-) (KO) murine model was crossed with the Transgenic Adenocarcinoma of Mouse Prostate (TRAMP) model. Mice were analyzed for initiation of prostate tumor by palpation and primary tumors were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Liver and lungs were examined for incidence and size of spontaneous metastatic lesions by histopathology. Knocking-out Cd151 had no significant effect on prostate cancer initiation or on expression of markers of proliferation, apoptosis, or angiogenesis in primary tumors. However, it did significantly decrease metastasis in a site-specific fashion, notably to the lungs but not the liver. Thus, CD151 acts principally as promoter of metastasis in this model. Prostate cancer is the second highest cause of cancer-related deaths in men in most Western countries, with the majority of deaths attributed to late-stage metastatic disease.

We previously demonstrated increased nuclear accumulation of PDK1 in cells with enhanced PI3K activity.

Cells with nuclear-localized PDK1 showed anchorage-independent growth, and when injected into mice, these cells induced the formation of solid tumors. In human prostate tumors, cytoplasmic localization of PDK1 correlated only with early-stage, low-risk tumors, whereas nuclear PDK1 localization correlated with high-risk tumors.

Materials and methods:   Ten Brazilian patients underwent primary cryoablation for localized prostate cancer between October 2010 and June 2011. All patients consented for whole gland primary cryotherapy. The procedures were performed by 3rd generation cryoablation with the Cryocare System ® (Endocare, Irvine, California). Preoperative data collection included patient demographics along with prostate gland size, Gleason score, serum prostate specific antigen, and erectile function status. Operative and post--operative assessment involved estimated blood loss, operative time, complications, serum PSA level, erectile function status, urinary incontinence, biochemical disease free survival (BDFS), and follow-up time.  Results:   All patients in the study successfully underwent whole gland cryoablation. The mean of: age, prostate size, PSA level, and Gleason score, was 66.2 years old; 40.7 g; 7.8 ng/mL; and 6 respectively. All patients were classified as low or moderate D' Amico risk (5 low and 5 moderate). Erectile dysfunction was present in 50% of patients. The estimated blood loss was minimal, operative time was 46.1 minutes. All patients that developed erectile dysfunction post-treatment responded to oral or intracavernosal medications with early penile rehabilitation. All patients maintained urinary continence by the end of a 10 months evaluation period and none had biochemical relapse within the mean follow-up of 13 months (7-15 months).

To investigate its putative function in PCa biology, we used gene expression knockdown by small interference RNA, and also analyzed its involvement in androgen receptor (AR) signaling.  Methods:   LNCaP and PC3 cells were used as in vitro models for these functional assays, and three different siRNA sequences were specifically designed to target PCA3 exon 4. Transfected cells were analyzed by real-time qRT-PCR and cell growth, viability, and apoptosis assays. Associations between PCA3 and the androgen-receptor (AR) signaling pathway were investigated by treating LNCaP cells with 100 nM dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and with its antagonist (flutamide), and analyzing the expression of some AR-modulated genes (TMPRSS2, NDRG1, GREB1, PSA, AR, FGF8, CdK1, CdK2 and PMEPA1). PCA3 expression levels were investigated in different cell compartments by using differential centrifugation and qRT-PCR.  Results:   LNCaP siPCA3-transfected cells significantly inhibited cell growth and viability, and increased the proportion of cells in the sub G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle and the percentage of pyknotic nuclei, compared to those transfected with scramble siRNA (siSCr)-transfected cells. DHT-treated LNCaP cells induced a significant upregulation of PCA3 expression, which was reversed by flutamide. In siPCA3/LNCaP-transfected cells, the expression of AR target genes was downregulated compared to siSCr-transfected cells. The siPCA3 transfection also counteracted DHT stimulatory effects on the AR signaling cascade, significantly downregulating expression of the AR target gene. Analysis of PCA3 expression in different cell compartments provided evidence that the main functional roles of PCA3 occur in the nuclei and microsomal cell fractions.  Conclusions:   Our findings suggest that the ncRNA PCA3 is involved in the control of PCa cell survival, in part through modulating AR signaling, which may raise new possibilities of using PCA3 knockdown as an additional therapeutic strategy for PCa control.""","""['Luciana Bueno Ferreira', 'Antonio Palumbo', 'Kivvi Duarte de Mello', 'Cinthya Sternberg', 'Mauricio S Caetano', 'Felipe Leite de Oliveira', 'Adriana Freitas Neves', 'Luiz Eurico Nasciutti', 'Luiz Ricardo Goulart', 'Etel Rodrigues Pereira Gimba']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['PCA3 long noncoding RNA modulates the expression of key cancer-related genes in LNCaP prostate cancer cells.', 'CA916798 affects growth and metastasis of androgen-dependent prostate cancer cells.', 'PCA3 Silencing Sensitizes Prostate Cancer Cells to Enzalutamide-mediated Androgen Receptor Blockade.', 'Prostate androgen-regulated gene: a novel potential target for androgen-independent prostate cancer therapy.', 'Interaction between Non-Coding RNAs and Androgen Receptor with an Especial Focus on Prostate Cancer.', 'Identification of androgen response-related lncRNAs in prostate cancer.', 'Dysregulation of the PRUNE2/PCA3 genetic axis in human prostate cancer: from experimental discovery to validation in two independent patient cohorts.', 'Distinct Expression of Surface and Genetic Biomarkers in Prostate Cancer Cell Lines.', 'Biomarkers for the Detection and Risk Stratification of Aggressive Prostate Cancer.', 'The Role of Long Non-Coding RNAs in Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition-Related Signaling Pathways in Prostate Cancer.']"""

Over-treatment of indolent prostate cancer lesions is a problem which can result in increased human and medical costs. Lesions with a low suspician level at mpMRI of the prostate have low risk of including high risk prostate cancer.  Objective:   To determine whether multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) has the potential to identify patients at low risk for cancer, thus obviating the need for biopsy. Prostate cancer is currently diagnosed by random biopsies, resulting in the discovery of multiple low-risk cancers that often lead to overtreatment.  Patients and methods:   We reviewed 800 consecutive patients who underwent a 3 Tesla mpMRI of the prostate with an endorectal coil from March 2007 to November 2011. All suspicious lesions were independently reviewed by two radiologists using T2-weighted, diffusion-weighted, spectroscopic and dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI sequences. Patients with only low suspicion lesions (maximum of two positive parameters on mpMRI) who subsequently underwent transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS)/MRI fusion targeted biopsy were selected for analysis.  Results:   In total, 125 patients with only low suspicion prostatic lesions on mpMRI were identified. On TRUS/MRI fusion biopsy, 77 (62%) of these patients had no cancer detected, 38 patients had Gleason 6 disease and 10 patients had Gleason 7 (3+4) disease. There were 30 patients with cancer detected on biopsy who qualified for active surveillance using 2011 National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines. No cases of high-risk (≥ Gleason 4+3) cancer were identified on biopsy and, of the fifteen patients who underwent radical prostatectomy at our institution, none were pathologically upgraded to high-risk cancer. Thus, for patients with only low suspicion lesions, 107 (88%) patients either had no cancer or clinically insignificant disease.  Conclusions:   The results obtained in the present study show that low suspicion lesions on mpMRI are associated with either negative biopsies or low-grade tumours suitable for active surveillance.

Very few studies have examined end-of-life urological studies in men with prostate cancer. These studies reported fewer procedures in men who received primary therapy for prostate cancer. However, these studies were typically single institution or had a short follow-up period. The present study is the first population-based study examining end-of-life urological procedures and uses a geographic region encompassing 385 000 patients. Furthermore, this study incorporates both hospital- and office-based procedures. This approach has not been previously undertaken.  Objective:   To determine using a population-based approach whether men with end-stage prostate cancer who had definitive primary therapy might require fewer urological interventions. Repeated urological procedures can impact health-related quality of life in patients dying from prostate cancer.  Patients and methods:   Using the Marshfield Epidemiological Study Area (MESA) database and tumour registry, we compared end-of-life interventions in men who died from prostate cancer between 1991 and 2009. Patient charts were queried for urological procedures using International Classification of Disease Modification, 9th edition (ICD9) codes for 3 years before death. Clinicopathological information was examined including whether the patient had a history of primary therapy (radiation or radical prostatectomy).  Results:   Among 280 patients dying from prostate cancer, 52 (19%) required 153 urological procedures during the last 3 years of life. The frequency of procedures increased closer to death. The most common procedures involved nephrostomy tube (56%), Foley catheter (24%) and transurethral resection of the prostate (10%). Clinicopathological features did not predict the need for an end-of-life urological procedure. There was no difference in the frequency of upper or lower tract procedures in surgery or radiation patients compared with patients without primary therapy (P = 0.556 and P = 0.508). Using a Kaplan-Meier analysis, there were no differences between groups in the proportion of patients not requiring a procedure (n = 280; P = 0.179).  Conclusions:   This is the first population-based study to examine the frequency of urological procedures in patients with end-stage prostate cancer. A minority of patients (19%) required urological procedures during the final 3 years of life.

In search for novel targets, microRNAs (miRNAs) are becoming an emerging area because miRNAs function as regulators of gene expression in human cancers including PCa. Previous studies from our laboratory have shown that the expression of miR-34a is significantly down-regulated in human PCa specimens consistent with PCa cell lines with aggressive characteristics, and that the silencing of miR-34a expression was in part due to hypermethylation of its promoter. There are several genes that are direct targets of miR-34a, and in the current study we investigated the cellular consequence of miR-34a over-expression and under-expression in the regulation of androgen receptor (AR) and Notch-1 in PCa cells. We found that over-expression of miR-34a led to reduced expression of AR, PSA and Notch-1. We also found that over-expression of miR-34a significantly inhibited the growth of PCa cells. Moreover, over-expression of miR-34a resulted in decreased self-renewal capacity of PCa cells, and conversely inactivation of miR-34a led to increased self-renewal capacity, which is an indication of tumor cell aggressiveness. These findings suggest that the loss of miR-34a is directly linked with up-regulation of AR and Notch-1 both of which are highly expressed in PCa, and thus finding innovative approaches by which miR-34a expression could be up-regulated will have a huge impact on the treatment of PCa especially for the treatment of mCRPC.""","""['Maria Kashat', 'Lyna Azzouz', 'Shaan H Sarkar', 'Dejuan Kong', 'Yiwei Li', 'Fazlul H Sarkar']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Am J Transl Res""","""['Erratum: Epigenetic silencing of miR-34a in human prostate cancer cells and tumor tissue specimens can be reversed by BR-DIM treatment.', 'Epigenetic silencing of miR-34a in human prostate cancer cells and tumor tissue specimens can be reversed by BR-DIM treatment.', 'MicroRNA-34a Attenuates Paclitaxel Resistance in Prostate Cancer Cells via Direct Suppression of JAG1/Notch1 Axis.', 'MicroRNA-34a, Prostate Cancer Stem Cells, and Therapeutic Development.', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Artificial intelligence-driven pan-cancer analysis reveals miRNA signatures for cancer stage prediction.', 'State-of-the-art therapeutic strategies for targeting cancer stem cells in prostate cancer.', 'Molecular Mechanisms of Noncoding RNA in the Occurrence of Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Age- and Stage-Dependent Prostate Cancer Aggressiveness Associated with Differential Notch Signaling.', 'Identification of the Regulatory Targets of miR-3687 and miR-4417 in Prostate Cancer Cells Using a Proteomics Approach.']"""

Some evidence suggests that it is possible to derive additional information about tumors from expression analysis of CTCs, but the technical difficulty of isolating and analyzing individual CTCs has limited progress in this area. To assess the ability of a new generation of MagSweeper to isolate intact CTCs for downstream analysis, we performed mRNA-Seq on single CTCs isolated from the blood of patients with metastatic prostate cancer and on single prostate cancer cell line LNCaP cells spiked into the blood of healthy donors. We found that the MagSweeper effectively isolated CTCs with a capture efficiency that matched the CellSearch platform. However, unlike CellSearch, the MagSweeper facilitates isolation of individual live CTCs without contaminating leukocytes. Importantly, mRNA-Seq analysis showed that the MagSweeper isolation process did not have a discernible impact on the transcriptional profile of single LNCaPs isolated from spiked human blood, suggesting that any perturbations caused by the MagSweeper process on the transcriptional signature of isolated cells are modest. Although the RNA from patient CTCs showed signs of significant degradation, consistent with reports of short half-lives and apoptosis amongst CTCs, transcriptional signatures of prostate tissue and of cancer were readily detectable with single CTC mRNA-Seq.

One of the conflicts with this model is that cancer stem cells have been described to lack androgen receptor (AR) expression, which is of established importance in prostate cancer initiation and progression. We re-examined the expression patterns of AR within adult prostate epithelial differentiation using an optimised sensitive and specific approach examining transcript, protein and AR regulated gene expression. Highly enriched populations were isolated consisting of stem (α(2)β(1)(HI) CD133(+VE)), transiently amplifying (α(2)β(1)(HI) CD133(-VE)) and terminally differentiated (α(2)β(1)(LOW) CD133(-VE)) cells. AR transcript and protein expression was confirmed in α(2)β(1)(HI) CD133(+VE) and CD133(-VE) progenitor cells. Flow cytometry confirmed that median (±SD) fraction of cells expressing AR were 77% (±6%) in α(2)β(1)(HI) CD133(+VE) stem cells and 68% (±12%) in α(2)β(1)(HI) CD133(-VE) transiently amplifying cells. However, 3-fold lower levels of total AR protein expression (peak and median immunofluorescence) were present in α(2)β(1)(HI) CD133(+VE) stem cells compared with differentiated cells. This finding was confirmed with dual immunostaining of prostate sections for AR and CD133, which again demonstrated low levels of AR within basal CD133(+VE) cells. Activity of the AR was confirmed in prostate progenitor cells by the expression of low levels of the AR regulated genes PSA, KLK2 and TMPRSS2. The confirmation of AR expression in prostate progenitor cells allows integration of the cancer stem cell theory with the established models of prostate cancer initiation based on a functional AR. Further study of specific AR functions in prostate stem and differentiated cells may highlight novel mechanisms of prostate homeostasis and insights into tumourigenesis.""","""['Stuart C Williamson', 'Anastasia C Hepburn', 'Laura Wilson', 'Kelly Coffey', 'Claudia A Ryan-Munden', 'Deepali Pal', 'Hing Y Leung', 'Craig N Robson', 'Rakesh Heer']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['The role of androgen in determining differentiation and regulation of androgen receptor expression in the human prostatic epithelium transient amplifying population.', 'Hunterian Lecture.

The Src protein tyrosine kinase has been implicated in many of the biochemical pathways that drive these behaviors. Although Src itself is only rarely mutated in human tumors, its aberrant activity has been noted in various cancers and suggested to serve as a barometer of metastatic potential. With these features in mind, we examined Src kinase regulation at the structural, enzymatic, and expression levels as a function of progressively invasive prostate cancer cell lines. Surprisingly, both total Src content and kinase activity decrease with increasing cell line aggressiveness, an observation that appears to be inconsistent with the well-documented role of Src in the signaling pathways that drive growth and invasion. However, we do observe a direct correlation between Src kinase specific activity (total Src kinase activity/total Src content) and metastatic aggressiveness, possibly suggesting that in highly aggressive cell lines, key signaling enzymes are globally recruited to drive the cancerous phenotype. In addition, although the expected enhanced phosphorylation of Src at Tyr-416 (activation site) is present in the most aggressive prostate cancer cell lines, unexpectedly high phosphorylation levels at the Tyr-527 inhibitory site are observed as well.

Gain-and loss-of-function studies in several vertebrate species have demonstrated a requirement for Gbx2 in development of the anterior hindbrain, spinal cord, inner ear, heart, and neural crest cells. However, the target genes through which GBX2 exerts its effects remain obscure. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with direct sequencing (ChIP-Seq) analysis in a human prostate cancer cell line, we identified cis-regulatory elements bound by GBX2 to provide insight into its direct downstream targets. The analysis revealed more than 286 highly significant candidate target genes, falling into various functional groups, of which 51% are expressed in the nervous system. Several of the top candidate genes include EEF1A1, ROBO1, PLXNA4, SLIT3, NRP1, and NOTCH2, as well as genes associated with the Usher syndrome, PCDH15 and USH2A, and are plausible candidates contributing to the developmental defects in Gbx2(-/-) mice. We show through gel shift analyses that sequences within the promoter or introns of EEF1A1, ROBO1, PCDH15, USH2A and NOTCH2, are directly bound by GBX2. Consistent with these in vitro results, analyses of Gbx2(-/-) embryos indicate that Gbx2 function is required for migration of Robo1-expressing neural crest cells out of the hindbrain. Furthermore, we show that GBX2 activates transcriptional activity through the promoter of EEF1A1, suggesting that GBX2 could also regulate gene expression indirectly via EEF1A.

A heat-map of the microarray revealed considerable differences in the expression of GPCRs between NHLF and H1975 cells.

Among them, treatment with either a selective antagonist of adenosine A2a receptors, which were highly expressed in H1975 cell and another gefitinib-resistant NSCLC cells, HCC827GR cells or ""small interfering RNA"" (siRNA) targeting adenosine A2a receptors produced a significant decrease in cell viability of both H1975 and HCC827GR cells.

For example, in type 2 diabetes, odds ratios for established variants estimated from low-BMI cases are larger than those estimated from high-BMI cases. An unanswered question is how to use this information to maximize statistical power in case-control studies that ascertain individuals on the basis of phenotype (case-control ascertainment) or phenotype and clinical covariates (case-control-covariate ascertainment). While current approaches improve power in studies with random ascertainment, they often lose power under case-control ascertainment and fail to capture available power increases under case-control-covariate ascertainment. We show that an informed conditioning approach, based on the liability threshold model with parameters informed by external epidemiological information, fully accounts for disease prevalence and non-random ascertainment of phenotype as well as covariates and provides a substantial increase in power while maintaining a properly controlled false-positive rate. Our method outperforms standard case-control association tests with or without covariates, tests of gene x covariate interaction, and previously proposed tests for dealing with covariates in ascertained data, with especially large improvements in the case of case-control-covariate ascertainment. We investigate empirical case-control studies of type 2 diabetes, prostate cancer, lung cancer, breast cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, age-related macular degeneration, and end-stage kidney disease over a total of 89,726 samples. In these datasets, informed conditioning outperforms logistic regression for 115 of the 157 known associated variants investigated (P-value = 1 × 10(-9)).

Materials and methods:   Text from 4409 clinical encounters for 33 men enrolled in a 15-year longitudinal clinical/molecular autopsy study of metastatic prostate cancer (Project to ELIminate lethal CANcer) was subjected to natural language processing (NLP) using Unified Medical Language System-based terms. A four-tiered pain scale was developed, and logistic regression analysis identified factors that correlated with experience of severe pain during each month.  Results:   NLP identified 6387 pain and 13 827 drug mentions in the text. Graphical displays revealed the pain 'landscape' described in the textual records and confirmed dramatically increasing levels of pain in the last years of life in all but two patients, all of whom died from metastatic cancer. Severe pain was associated with receipt of opioids (OR=6.6, p<0.0001) and palliative radiation (OR=3.4, p=0.0002). Surprisingly, no severe or controlled pain was detected in two of 33 subjects' clinical records. Additionally, the NLP algorithm proved generalizable in an evaluation using a separate data source (889 Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside (i2b2) discharge summaries).  Discussion:   Patterns in the pain experience, undetectable without the use of NLP to mine the longitudinal clinical record, were consistent with clinical expectations, suggesting that meaningful NLP-based pain status monitoring is feasible. Findings in this initial cohort suggest that 'outlier' pain phenotypes useful for probing the molecular basis of cancer pain may exist.  Limitations:   The results are limited by a small cohort size and use of proprietary NLP software.

To evaluate each technique, the histology data must be precisely mapped to the imaged data. As the histology slices cannot be assumed to be cut along the same plane as the imaged data were acquired, the registration must be considered as a 3-D problem. This requires the prior alignment of the histology slices. We propose a protocol in which three needles are inserted into the fresh prostate, creating internal fiducial markers visible in the histology slices. Our algorithm then automatically detects and identifies these markers, enabling the automatic rigid alignment of each slice. The accuracy of the algorithm was quantified in simulated images, a beef liver sample in which a validation marker had been created, and ten prostate specimens. The simulated images showed that the algorithm has no associated residual error for a situation where there is no deformation. In the beef liver images, the average accuracy of the alignment was 0.12 ± 0.09 mm at the fiducial markers, and 0.62 ± 0.46 mm at a validation marker positioned approximately 20 mm from the fiducial markers. Concerning the ten prostates, there were 19.2 histology slices on average per specimen. On average, 93.7% of the fiducial markers created were visible in the slices, of which 96.1% were then automatically and correctly detected and identified, enabling an alignment of average accuracy 0.18 ± 0.13 mm at the fiducial markers. As a cancer of volume <0.5 cm(3) is classified as clinically insignificant, the accuracy achieved justified the choice of a rigid registration.

SNPs in GPX2, GPX3, GPX4, SEP15, and SEPP1 had different risk estimates for PCa in subgroups based on stage and grade. We observed associations between SNPs in GPX4, and TXNRD1 and risk of PCSM. None of these associations, however, remained significant after adjustment for multiple comparisons.  Conclusions:   We found evidence that genetic variation in a subset of selenoenzyme genes may alter risk of PCa and PCSM.

Aim of this study was to identify prognostic indicators of a positive second TURB or the need for a subsequent cystectomy.  Materials and methods:   The study cohort consisted of 101 patients with high-risk BC (T1G2-3, TaG3, Carcinoma in situ) who underwent second TURB after complete first resection. Age, gender, stage, grade, carcinoma in situ (Cis), tumour number, size, localization, surgeon experience and bladder wash cytology before the second TURB were considered as potential prognostic factors of positive histology at second TURB or the need for subsequent cystectomy.  Results:   The mean follow-up period was 23.8 months. The study cohort was comprised of 82 males and 17 females. Cytology on bladder wash urine was performed in 85/101 patients and in 39 was negative; 55.5 % of second TURB specimens were negative. The rate of upstaging to ≥T2 was 4.9 %. Cis (OR 8.4; 95 % CI 1.3-54.2; p = 0.03) and positive cytology (OR 6.8; 95 % CI 2.3-19.9; p = <0.01) were independent prognostic factors of a residual tumour in the second TURB. Cytology also correlated with clinical need for cystectomy in the follow-up (HR 6.5; 95 % CI 1.3-30.5; p = 0.02).

The multi-focal characteristics of prostate tumors cause inhomogeneity and local property variance in the prostate glands, which is one reason for inaccurate property characterizations of the tumors. Therefore, biomechanical models should include inhomogeneity and local property variance by taking into consideration the anatomical information (location and volume) of the tumors. We developed six inhomogeneous local prostate models using the finite element method, which takes into account the location and volume information of prostate tumors. The models were divided into six different sections: lateral apex, lateral mid, lateral base, medial apex, medial mid and medial base tumors. Information on the location and volume of prostate tumors was obtained using pathological analysis. The mechanical properties of prostate tumors were estimated using the developed model simulation and the ex vivo indentation experiment results from the human resected prostates. The results showed that the mean elastic moduli of the normal and tumoral regions were 14.7 and 41.6 kPa, respectively. Our models provided more reliable estimates of the elastic moduli than the conventionally used Hertz-Sneddon model, and the results from our model were more closely correlated with previous studies due to the inclusion of the anatomical information via inhomogeneous modeling.

Unlike conventional approaches to observe these processes, such as exchange spectroscopy (EXSY), this rapid approach requires only a single encoding step and thus is readily applicable to hyperpolarized MR in which the magnetization is not replenished after T(1) decay and RF excitations. This method is based on stimulated-echoes and uses phase-sensitive detection in conjunction with precisely chosen echo times in order to separate spins generated during the mixing time from those present prior to mixing. We are calling the method Metabolic Activity Decomposition Stimulated-echo Acquisition Mode or MAD-STEAM. We have validated this approach as well as applied it in vivo to normal mice and a transgenic prostate cancer mouse model for observing pyruvate-lactate conversion, which has been shown to be elevated in numerous tumor types. In this application, it provides an improved measure of cellular metabolism by separating [1-(13)C]-lactate produced in tissue by metabolic conversion from [1-(13)C]-lactate that has flowed into the tissue or is in the blood.

Indeed, the proteasome is often found to be overactive in cancer cells. It has also been found that cancer cells are more sensitive to proteasome inhibition than normal cells, and therefore proteasome inhibitors are pursued as antitumor drugs. The use of the proteasome inhibitor Bortezomib for treatment of multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma has proved this principle. Recent studies have suggested that copper complexes can inhibit proteasome activity and induce apoptosis in some human cancer cells. However, the involved molecular mechanism is unknown. In this study, we investigated the biological activities of four amino acid Schiff base-copper(II) complexes by using human breast (MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7) and prostate (PC-3) cancer cells. The complexes C1 and C3, but not their counterparts C2 and C4, inhibit the chymotrypsin-like activity of purified 20S proteasome and human cancer cellular 26S proteasome, cause accumulation of proteasome target proteins Bax and IκB-α, and induce growth inhibition and apoptosis in concentration- and time-dependent manners. Docking analysis shows that C1, but not C2 has hydrophobic, pi-pi, pi-cation and hydrogen bond interactions with the proteasomal chymotrypsin-like pocket and could stably fit into the S3 region, leading to specific inhibition. Our study has identified the mechanism of action of these copper complexes on inhibiting tumor cell proteasome and suggested their great potential as novel anticancer agents.""","""['Jian Zuo', 'Caifeng Bi', 'Yuhua Fan', 'Daniela Buac', 'Chiara Nardon', 'Kenyon G Daniel', 'Q Ping Dou']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Inorg Biochem""","""['L-Ornithine Schiff base-copper and -cadmium complexes as new proteasome inhibitors and apoptosis inducers in human cancer cells.', 'Metal-based 2,3-indolinedione derivatives as proteasome inhibitors and inducers of apoptosis in human cancer cells.', 'Amino- and chloro-8-hydroxyquinolines and their copper complexes as proteasome inhibitors and antiproliferative agents.', 'Novel copper complexes as potential proteasome inhibitors for cancer treatment (Review).', 'Computational Approaches for the Discovery of Human Proteasome Inhibitors: An Overview.', 'Design, synthesis, molecular modeling, and bioactivity evaluation of 1,10-phenanthroline and prodigiosin (Ps) derivatives and their Copper(I) complexes against mTOR and HDAC enzymes as highly potent and effective new anticancer therapeutic drugs.', 'Transition Metal Complexes with Tridentate Schiff Bases (O\u2009N\u2009O and O\u2009N\u2009N) Derived from Salicylaldehyde: An Analysis of Their Potential Anticancer Activity.', 'Response of Ancillary Azide Ligand in Designing a 1D Copper(II) Polymeric Complex along with the Introduction of High DNA- and HAS-Binding Efficacy, Leading to Impressive Anticancer Activity: A Compact Experimental and Theoretical Approach.', ""Copper coordination compounds with (5Z,5Z')-2,2'-(alkane-α,ω-diyldiselenyl)-bis-5-(2-pyridylmethylene)-3,5-dihydro-4H-imidazol-4-ones.

Abiraterone acetate potently disrupts intracrine androgen receptor signalling pathways implicated in the progression of the disease, including bone metastases. We assessed data for pain control and skeletal-related events prospectively collected as part of the randomised, phase 3 COU-AA-301 trial of abiraterone acetate plus prednisone versus placebo plus prednisone in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer after docetaxel chemotherapy.  Methods:   The COU-AA-301 trial enrolled patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer in whom one or two lines of chemotherapy (one docetaxel based) had been unsuccessful and who had Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance statuses of 2 or less. Pain intensity and interference of pain with daily activities were assessed with the Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form questionnaire at baseline, day 15 of cycle 1, and day 1 of each treatment cycle thereafter until discontinuation. We assessed, with prospectively defined response criteria that incorporated analgesic use, clinically meaningful changes in pain intensity and interference with daily living. We measured time to first occurrence of skeletal-related events, which we defined as pathological fracture, spinal cord compression, palliative radiation to bone, or bone surgery, and regularly assessed them throughout the study. Pain palliation was assessed in patients who had clinically significant baseline pain, whereas all other analyses were done in the overall intention-to-treat population. COU-AA-301 is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00638690.  Findings:   Median follow-up was 20·2 months (IQR 18·4-22·1). In patients with clinically significant pain at baseline, abiraterone acetate and prednisone resulted in significantly more palliation (157 of 349 [45·0%] patients vs 47 of 163 [28·8%]; p=0·0005) and faster palliation (median time to palliation 5·6 months [95% CI 3·7-9·2] vs 13·7 months [5·4-not estimable]; p=0·0018) of pain intensity than did prednisone only. Palliation of pain interference (134 of 223 [60·1%] vs 38 of 100 [38·0%], p=0·0002; median time to palliation of pain interference 1·0 months [95% CI 0·9-1·9] vs 3·7 months [2·7-not estimable], p=0·0004) and median duration of palliation of pain intensity (4·2 months [95% CI 3·0-4·9] vs 2·1 months [1·4-3·7]; p=0·0056) were significantly better with abiraterone acetate and prednisone than with prednisone only.

The case of hormonal therapy to treat prostate cancer""","""Objectives:   Prostate cancer patients, as well as their caregivers and healthcare providers, often search the Internet for information about treatment options. We aimed to assess how accurate and up-to-date information about prostate cancer treatments is on websites owned and managed by health-related organizations that most patients and health care providers would consider to be the most trustworthy, based on the reputations of the site providers.  Materials and methods:   We reviewed 43 noncommercial and easily found websites that offered extensive information on treatment options for prostate cancer patients. To assess how comprehensive the sites were, we focused on the information they provided on alternative hormonal therapies to commonly prescribed luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists, namely GnRH antagonists and parenteral estradiol.  Results:   Only 14 of 43 websites presented GnRH antagonists as a therapy option for prostate cancer. Sixteen of these 43 websites presented estrogen as a possible treatment option, but only 1 of the 43 websites contained current information on parenteral estrogen treatments. Less than half of the sites provided time stamps indicating when they were last updated. Furthermore, most sites with time stamps were not in fact up-to-date based on the information posted on the site.  Conclusions:   Few seemingly reputable Internet sources for medical information provide viewers with the detailed and up-to-date information that they may expect from such sites when searching for alternatives to standard treatment for androgen suppression. Strategies for keeping such websites up-to-date and reliable are discussed. Sites may improve their credibility and usefulness if they (1) present all evidence-based treatment options, (2) regularly update and time stamp their information, (3) acknowledge that their recommendations on treatments may become out-of-date quickly, (4) and direct viewers to information on relevant, active clinical trials.

We developed a radiosynthesis of [(11)C]YM155 to non-invasively evaluate its tissue and tumor distribution in mice bearing human prostate tumor xenografts.  Methods:   Methods utilizing [(11)C]acetyl chloride and [(11)C]methyl triflate, both accessible with automated radiosynthesis boxes, were evaluated. The O-methylation of ethanolamine-alkolate with [(11)C]methyl triflate proved to be the key development toward a rapid and efficient process. The whole-body distribution of [(11)C]YM155 in PC-3 xenografted mice was examined using a planar positron imaging system (PPIS).  Results:   Sufficient quantities of radiopharmaceutical grade [(11)C]YM155 were produced for our PET imaging and distribution studies. The decay corrected (EOB) radiochemical yield was 16-22%, within a synthesis time of 47 min. The radiochemical purity was higher than 99%, and the specific activity was 29-60 GBq/μmol (EOS). High uptake levels of radioactivity (%ID/g, mean±SE) were observed in tumor (0.0613±0.0056), kidneys (0.0513±0.0092), liver (0.0368±0.0043) and cecum (0.0623±0.0070). The highest tumor uptake was observed at an early time point (from 10 min after) following injection. Tumor-to-blood and tumor-to-muscle uptake ratios of [(11)C]YM155, at 40 min after injection, were 26.5 (±2.9) and 25.6 (±3.6), respectively.  Conclusion:   A rapid method for producing a radiopharmaceutical grade [(11)C]YM155 was developed. An in vivo distribution study using PPIS showed high uptake of [(11)C]YM155 in tumor tissue.

Many individual lipid molecules have been associated with the evolution of prostate cancer; however, none of them has been approved to be used as a biomarker. The aim of this study is to identify lipid molecules from hundreds plasma apparent lipid species as biomarkers for diagnosis of prostate cancer.  Methodology/principal findings:   Using lipidomics, lipid profiling of 390 individual apparent lipid species was performed on 141 plasma samples from 105 patients with prostate cancer and 36 male controls. High throughput data generated from lipidomics were analyzed using bioinformatic and statistical methods. From 390 apparent lipid species, 35 species were demonstrated to have potential in differentiation of prostate cancer. Within the 35 species, 12 were identified as individual plasma lipid biomarkers for diagnosis of prostate cancer with a sensitivity above 80%, specificity above 50% and accuracy above 80%. Using top 15 of 35 potential biomarkers together increased predictive power dramatically in diagnosis of prostate cancer with a sensitivity of 93.6%, specificity of 90.1% and accuracy of 97.3%. Principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA) demonstrated that patient and control populations were visually separated by identified lipid biomarkers. RandomForest and 10-fold cross validation analyses demonstrated that the identified lipid biomarkers were able to predict unknown populations accurately, and this was not influenced by patient's age and race. Three out of 13 lipid classes, phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), ether-linked phosphatidylethanolamine (ePE) and ether-linked phosphatidylcholine (ePC) could be considered as biomarkers in diagnosis of prostate cancer.

We hypothesized that in addition to natural CD4(+)CD25(+) regulatory T cells (Tregs) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells, tumor Ag-specific Tregs interfere with the detection of anti-tumor immunity after immunotherapy. Using samples from prostate cancer patients immunized with a DNA vaccine encoding prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP) and a trans-vivo delayed-type hypersensitivity (tvDTH) assay, we found that the detection of PAP-specific effector responses after immunization was prevented by the activity of PAP-specific regulatory cells. These regulatory cells were CD8(+)CTLA-4(+), and their suppression was relieved by blockade of CTLA-4, but not IL-10 or TGF-β. Moreover, Ag-specific CD8(+) Tregs were detected prior to immunization in the absence of PAP-specific effector responses. These PAP-specific CD8(+)CTLA-4(+) suppressor T cells expressed IL-35, which was decreased after blockade of CTLA-4, and inhibition of either CTLA-4 or IL-35 reversed PAP-specific suppression of tvDTH response. PAP-specific CD8(+)CTLA-4(+) T cells also suppressed T cell proliferation in an IL-35-dependent, contact-independent fashion. Taken together, these findings suggest a novel population of CD8(+)CTLA-4(+) IL-35-secreting tumor Ag-specific Tregs arise spontaneously in some prostate cancer patients, persist during immunization, and can prevent the detection of Ag-specific effector responses by an IL-35-dependent mechanism.""","""['Brian M Olson', 'Ewa Jankowska-Gan', 'Jordan T Becker', 'Dario A A Vignali', 'William J Burlingham', 'Douglas G McNeel']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""J Immunol""","""['Plasmid DNA vaccine encoding prostatic acid phosphatase is effective in eliciting autologous antigen-specific CD8+ T cells.', 'HLA-A2-restricted T-cell epitopes specific for prostatic acid phosphatase.', 'Dual blockade of PD-1 and CTLA-4 combined with tumor vaccine effectively restores T-cell rejection function in tumors.', 'CTLA-4 blockade increases antigen-specific CD8(+) T cells in prevaccinated patients with melanoma: three cases.', 'Unmasking the immune recognition of prostate cancer with CTLA4 blockade.', 'Cytolytic CD4+ and CD8+ Regulatory T-Cells and Implications for Developing Immunotherapies to Combat Graft-Versus-Host Disease.', 'A Mutated Prostatic Acid Phosphatase (PAP) Peptide-Based Vaccine Induces PAP-Specific CD8+ T Cells with Ex Vivo Cytotoxic Capacities in HHDII/DR1 Transgenic Mice.', 'Interleukin-35 in autoimmune dermatoses: Current concepts.', 'PD-L1+CD8+ T\xa0cells enrichment in lung cancer exerted regulatory function and tumor-promoting tolerance.', 'Gut microbiota-derived metabolite 3-idoleacetic acid together with LPS induces IL-35+ B cell generation.']"""

Of the 100 patients included in the study, 20 were colonized with ciprofloxacin-resistant organisms, 19 of which were E. coli. There was no significant difference (P > 0.1) between the culture methods or the ciprofloxacin concentrations in the medium when identifying patients with ciprofloxacin-resistant E. coli; however, broth enrichment using 1 μg/ml ciprofloxacin was the most sensitive at 100%, but it was the least specific. Direct plating of rectal swabs onto MacConkey agar containing 10 μg/ml of ciprofloxacin was 100% specific and missed only 1 positive specimen, with a sensitivity of 94.7%; this method was the most cost-effective.

Quantitative real time PCR analysis showed that Bim was transcriptionally up-regulated. We have identified eight endogenous E2F1-binding sites on the Bim promoter using in silico analysis. Luciferase assay demonstrated that Bim expression was E2F1-dependent as mutation of the E2F1-binding sites on the Bim promoter inhibited luciferase activities. In support, E2F1 silencing led to the loss of Bim expression in cancer cells. Bim primarily localized to mitochondrial and cytoskeleton-associated fractions. Bim silencing or microinjection of anti-Bim antibodies into the cell cytoplasm resulted in cell rounding, detachment, and subsequent apoptosis. We observed up-regulation of prosurvival proteins Bcl-xL and Mcl-1, which sequester Bim in cancer cells. In addition, a phosphorylated form of Bim was also elevated in cancer cells.

However, the incomplete efficacy and lack of durable response to this clinical strategy highlights an urgent need for alternative treatment options to improve patient outcomes. Targeting the molecular chaperone heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) represents a potential avenue for therapeutic intervention as its inhibition results in the coordinate blockade of multiple oncogenic signaling pathways in cancer cells. Moreover, Hsp90 is essential for the stability and function of numerous client proteins, a number of which have been causally implicated in the pathogenesis of prostate cancer, including the androgen receptor (AR). Here, we examined the preclinical activity of ganetespib, a small molecule inhibitor of Hsp90, in a panel of prostate cancer cell lines. Ganetespib potently decreased viability in all lines, irrespective of their androgen sensitivity or receptor status, and more effectively than the ansamycin inhibitor 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG). Interestingly, while ganetespib exposure decreased AR expression and activation, the constitutively active V7 truncated isoform of the receptor was unaffected by Hsp90 inhibition. Mechanistically, ganetespib exerted concomitant effects on mitogenic and survival pathways, as well as direct modulation of cell cycle regulators, to induce growth arrest and apoptosis. Further, ganetespib displayed robust antitumor efficacy in both AR-negative and positive xenografts, including those derived from the 22Rv1 prostate cancer cell line that co-expresses full-length and variant receptors. Together these data suggest that further investigation of ganetespib as a new therapeutic treatment for prostate cancer patients is warranted.""","""['Suqin He', 'Chaohua Zhang', 'Ayesha A Shafi', 'Manuel Sequeira', 'Jaime Acquaviva', 'Julie C Friedland', 'Jim Sang', 'Donald L Smith', 'Nancy L Weigel', 'Yumiko Wada', 'David A Proia']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Int J Oncol""","""['Role of Ganetespib, an HSP90 Inhibitor, in Cancer Therapy: From Molecular Mechanisms to Clinical Practice.', 'Ganetespib, a unique triazolone-containing Hsp90 inhibitor, exhibits potent antitumor activity and a superior safety profile for cancer therapy.', 'Co-targeting AR and HSP90 suppresses prostate cancer cell growth and prevents resistance mechanisms.', 'Ganetespib (STA-9090), a nongeldanamycin HSP90 inhibitor, has potent antitumor activity in in vitro and in vivo models of non-small cell lung cancer.', 'Hsp90 as a therapeutic target in prostate cancer.', 'Role of Ganetespib, an HSP90 Inhibitor, in Cancer Therapy: From Molecular Mechanisms to Clinical Practice.', 'The evolution and polymorphism of mono-amino acid repeats in androgen receptor and their regulatory role in health and disease.', 'The endoplasmic reticulum stress response in prostate cancer.', 'HSP90 identified by a proteomic approach as druggable target to reverse platinum resistance in ovarian cancer.', 'Senolytic compounds control a distinct fate of androgen receptor agonist- and antagonist-induced cellular senescent LNCaP prostate cancer cells.']"""

Methods:   We evaluated a large series of 157 consecutive PC patients previously treated by radical prostatectomy who presented with biochemical recurrence with increasing PSA levels in spite of ongoing HT (HT-resistant patients). At the time of (11)C-choline PET/CT, the mean value of trigger PSA level was 8.3 (range 0.2 - 60.6 ng/mL), the mean PSA doubling time (PSAdt) was 5.3 (range 0.4 - 35 months), and the mean PSA velocity (PSAvel) was 22.1 ng/mL/year (range 0.12 - 82 ng/mL/year). (11)C-Choline PET/CT was performed following a standard procedure at our centre to investigate increasing PSA levels, either as the first imaging procedure or in patients with negative conventional imaging. At the time of (11)C-choline PET/CT all patients were receiving HT (61 were receiving monotherapy and 96 multidrug therapy). PET-positive findings were validated by: (a) transrectal US-guided biopsy in patients with recurrence in the prostatic bed, (b) surgical pelvic lymphadenectomy, (c) other imaging modalities, including repeated (11)C-choline PET/CT, performed during a minimum follow-up of 12-months.  Results:   (11)C-Choline PET/CT showed positive findings in 104 of the 157 patients (66 %). (11)C-choline PET/CT detected: a single lesion in 40 patients (7 in the prostate bed, 10 in lymph nodes, 22 in bone, 1 at another site); two lesions in 18 patients (7 in lymph nodes, 7 in bone, 4 in both lymph nodes and bone); three or four lesions in 7 patients (4 in lymph nodes, 2 in bone, 1 at another site); and more than four lesions in the remaining 39 patients (2 in the prostate bed, 12 in lymph nodes, 12 in bone, 11 in both lymph nodes and bone, 2 at other sites). In (11)C-choline PET-negative patients, the mean values of trigger PSA, PSAdt and PSAvel were 3.8 ng/mL (range 0.2-11.9 ng/mL) 7.0 months (range 1.21 - 35 months) and 5.8 ng/mL/year (range 0.12 - 30.1) respectively, while in (11)C-Choline-PET-positive patients they were 10.5 ng/mL (range 0.2 - 60.6), 4.4 months (range 0.4 - 19.7) and 15.9 ng/mL/year (range 0.5 - 82.0) respectively. The differences between PET-negative and PET-positive patients were statistically significant for all these parameters: trigger PSA, p < 0.01; PSAdt, p < 0.01; PSAvel, p = 0.03.  Conclusion:   In our patient population, (11)C-choline PET/CT was able to detect relapsed disease in a large proportion of HT-resistant PC patients during HT.

Electronic records of 184 SRT patients treated consecutively between October 2001 and February 2007 were analyzed. Median age was 64 years (median follow-up 48 months). NHT was given to 165 patients (median 3 months). Pre-RP and pre-SRT PSA, PSA doubling time, Gleason score (GS), seminal vesicle invasion (SVI) and detectable post-SRT PSA were recorded. Any detectable PSA or PSA >0.1 ng/ml + nadir was considered biochemical failure (BcF). The Charlson co-morbidity index was used to correlate co-morbidities and rectal-genitourinary toxicity. Scores from the health-related QoL EORTC QLQ-C30 and PR-25 questionnaires were also evaluated. In 116 (63%) patients, a long-lasting curative effect was indicated by undetectable PSA levels. In univariate analysis, using BcF as an outcome variable, p<0.001 was found for GS, pre-SRT PSA, SVI and detectable post-SRT PSA. Multivariate analysis showed p=0.01 for SVI, p=0.09 for GS, and detectable post-SRT PSA (p=0.01); with metastases as an outcome variable, only SVI was significant (p=0.007). Cancer-specific and overall survival were 99 and 95%, respectively. Although microscopy showed SVI or GS 8-10 in the prostatectomy specimens 17/40 (43%) and 13/29 (45%), respectively, of patients still showed undetectable PSA at long-term follow-up (median 55 months) after SRT. Likewise, 11/31 (36%) patients with pre-SRT PSA >1.0 ng/ml and 80/134 (60%) patients with PSA doubling time (PSADT) <10 still showed undetectable PSA after 50 months. Slightly elevated acute and late rectal-genitourinary grade 3-4 toxicity was observed. No association with co-morbidity/toxicity was found. EORTC QLQ-C30 scores were similar to or slightly better than reference values.

In this study, we investigated whether these treatments had a detrimental effect on patient-reported-outcome (PRO) scores.  Methods:   We undertook a phase 3 trial with a 2×2 factorial design in 23 centres in Australia and New Zealand in men with non-metastatic adenocarcinoma of the prostate (stage T2b-4 or T2a, Gleason score ≥7, and baseline prostate-specific antigen concentration [PSA] ≥10 μg/L), and without previous lymph node or systemic metastases or comorbidities that could reduce life expectancy to less than 5 years. The men were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to 6 months of neoadjuvant (short-term) androgen suppression (STAS) with leuprorelin (22·5 mg every 3 months, intramuscularly) or an additional 12 months (intermediate-term androgen suppression [ITAS]) of leuprorelin with or without 18 months of zoledronic acid (4 mg every 3 months, intravenously). Study drug administration commenced at randomisation after which radiotherapy started within the fifth month in all groups. Treatment allocation was open-label, and computer-generated randomisation, stratified by centre, baseline concentrations of PSA, clinical stage of the tumour, Gleason score, and use of a brachytherapy boost, was done by use of the minimisation technique. PRO scores were calculated from European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer quality-of-life and prostate-specific quality-of-life module questionnaires and compared with multiple regression models at baseline, and end of radiotherapy, and 18 months and 36 months according to group and radiation dose. The trial is ongoing and the primary endpoint, prostate-cancer-specific mortality, will be reported in 2014. This study is the final report of PRO scores (a secondary endpoint). Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00193856.  Findings:   1071 men were randomly assigned to STAS (n=268), STAS plus zoledronic acid (n=268), ITAS (n=268), and ITAS plus zoledronic acid (n=267). At the end of radiotherapy, significant detrimental changes in PRO scores (p<0·01) occurred in all groups. There were no significant differences in global health status between groups at any timepoint. At 18 months, PROs that were significantly worse in the ITAS groups when compared with STAS were hormone-treatment-related symptoms (HTRS; STAS, 10·20 [95% CI 8·66-11·75]; ITAS, 17·36 [13·63-21·08], p<0·01; and ITAS plus zoledronic acid, 19·14 [15·43-22·85], p<0·01), sexual activity (STAS, 26·38 [23·50-29·27]; ITAS, 14·40 [7·44-21·36], p<0·01; and ITAS plus zoledronic acid, 16·34 [9·39-23·28], p<0·01), social function (STAS, 90·31 [87·89-92·73]; ITAS, 87·35 [81·52-93·18], p=0·09; and ITAS plus zoledronic acid, 83·66 [77·85-89·48], p<0·01), fatigue (STAS, 17·05 [14·58-19·51]; ITAS 24·52 [18·58-30·46], p<0·01; and ITAS plus zoledronic acid, 24·26 [18·33-30·18], p<0·01), and financial problems (STAS, 3·39 [1·29-5·48]; ITAS, 8·97 [3·92-14·02], p<0·01; and ITAS plus zoledronic acid, 8·92 [3·89-13·96], p<0·01). With the exception of HTRS, in which marginal differences remained, persisting significant differences disappeared by 36 months. Other factors associated with significant detrimental changes in PRO scores were a brachytherapy boost, incomplete testosterone and haemoglobin recoveries, age, and smoking.  Interpretation:   Compared with 6 months of androgen suppression, 18 months of androgen suppression causes additional detrimental changes at the 18 month follow-up in some PRO scores but not in global quality-of-life scores. However, with the exception of HTRS, these differences resolved by 36 months. The use of zoledronic acid every 3 months over 18 months does not result in additional detrimental changes, but the use of a brachytherapy boost to achieve radiation dose escalation in the prostate can adversely affect emotional function and financial problems.

A positive association between Cd and cancer mortality risk was identified for both genders. Despite limited cause-specific deaths, the increased risk associated with Cd was significant for lung cancer in men. All-cause cancer mortality risk was significantly elevated among women with Zn intakes below the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) compared with women who met the RDA. The effect of low dietary Zn was not observed in men. Similar trends for prostate and breast cancer deaths were not significant. There was a significant inverse association between cancer deaths and the Zn-to-Cd ratio for both genders.

We have previously reported beneficial changes in healthy lifestyle behaviors, physical function and fatigue as a result of a novel combined exercise and dietary advice intervention (a lifestyle intervention) in men with prostate cancer on androgen suppression therapy (AST). The aim of this research was to conduct a qualitative evaluation of the lifestyle intervention in these men with advanced prostate cancer receiving androgen suppression therapy (AST).  Methods:   Twelve men with prostate cancer on AST took part in three focus groups in a UK higher education institution following the 12 week intervention. Sessions lasted between 45 and 60 minutes in duration. All discussions were audio-taped and transcribed. A framework analysis approach was applied to the focus group data. An initial coding framework was developed from a priori issues listed in the topic guide and extended and refined following initial familiarization with the focus group transcripts. Line by line indexing of the transcripts was undertaken iteratively to allow for the incorporation of new codes. Coded sections of text were grouped together (charted) into themes and subthemes prior to a further process of comparison and interpretation.  Results:   None of the participants involved in the trial were provided with information on how lifestyle changes might be beneficial to men with prostate cancer during the course of their standard medical treatment. We present novel findings that this intervention was considered beneficial for reducing anxiety around treatment and fear of disease progression. Men were supportive of the benefits of the intervention over conventional cancer survival discussion group arrangements as it facilitated peer support in addition to physical rehabilitation.  Conclusions:   The benefits of lifestyle changes in men with prostate cancer are not well appreciated by care providers despite a range of benefits becoming apparent.

Here we show they function in prostate tumor suppression in the mouse. Concomitant inactivation of Spry1 and Spry2 in prostate epithelium causes ductal hyperplasia and low-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN). However, when Spry1 and Spry2 loss-of-function occurs in the context of heterozygosity for a null allele of the tumor suppressor gene Pten, there is a striking increase in PIN and evidence of neoplastic invasion. Conversely, expression of a Spry2 gain-of-function transgene in Pten null prostatic epithelium suppresses the tumorigenic effects of loss of Pten function. We show that Sprouty gene loss-of-function results in hyperactive RAS/ERK1/2 signaling throughout the prostate epithelium and cooperates with heterozygosity for a Pten null allele to promote hyperactive PI3K/AKT signaling. Furthermore, Spry2 gain-of-function can suppress hyperactivation of AKT caused by the absence of PTEN. Together, these results point to a key genetic interaction between Sprouty genes and Pten in prostate tumorigenesis and provide strong evidence that Sprouty genes can function to modulate signaling via the RAS/ERK1/2 and PI3K/AKT pathways. The finding that Sprouty genes suppress tumorigenesis caused by Pten loss-of-function suggests that therapeutic approaches aimed at restoring normal feedback mechanisms triggered by receptor tyrosine kinase signaling, including Sprouty gene expression, may provide an effective strategy to delay or prevent high-grade PIN and invasive prostate cancer.""","""['Jennifer L Schutzman', 'Gail R Martin']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A""","""['Coordinated activity of Spry1 and Spry2 is required for normal development of the external genitalia.', 'The pace of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia development is determined by the timing of Pten tumor suppressor gene excision.', 'Sprouty2, PTEN, and PP2A interact to regulate prostate cancer progression.', 'The Par-4/PTEN connection in tumor suppression.', 'Sprouty and cancer: the first terms report.', 'Loss of SPRY2 contributes to cancer-associated fibroblasts activation and promotes breast cancer development.', 'The olfactory receptor OR51E2 activates ERK1/2 through the Golgi-localized Gβγ-PI3Kγ-ARF1 pathway in prostate cancer cells.', 'G protein βγ translocation to the Golgi apparatus activates MAPK via p110γ-p101 heterodimers.', 'Mechanistic insights explain the transforming potential of the T507K substitution in the protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP2.', 'DNAH10 mutation correlates with cisplatin sensitivity and tumor mutation burden in small-cell lung cancer.']"""

Prostate cancer cells roll on E-selectin(+) BMEC through E-selectin ligand-binding interactions under shear flow, and prostate cancer cells exhibit firm adhesion to BMEC via β1, β4, and αVβ3 integrins in static assays. However, whether these discrete prostate cancer cell-BMEC adhesive contacts culminate in cooperative, step-wise transendothelial migration into bone is not known. Here, we describe how metastatic prostate cancer cells breach BMEC monolayers in a step-wise fashion under physiologic hemodynamic flow. Prostate cancer cells tethered and rolled on BMEC and then firmly adhered to and traversed BMEC via sequential dependence on E-selectin ligands and β1 and αVβ3 integrins. Expression analysis in human metastatic prostate cancer tissue revealed that β1 was markedly upregulated compared with expression of other β subunits. Prostate cancer cell breaching was regulated by Rac1 and Rap1 GTPases and, notably, did not require exogenous chemokines as β1, αVβ3, Rac1, and Rap1 were constitutively active. In homing studies, prostate cancer cell trafficking to murine femurs was dependent on E-selectin ligand, β1 integrin, and Rac1. Moreover, eliminating E-selectin ligand-synthesizing α1,3 fucosyltransferases in transgenic adenoma of mouse prostate mice dramatically reduced prostate cancer incidence. These results unify the requirement for E-selectin ligands, α1,3 fucosyltransferases, β1 and αVβ3 integrins, and Rac/Rap1 GTPases in mediating prostate cancer cell homing and entry into bone and offer new insight into the role of α1,3 fucosylation in prostate cancer development.""","""['Steven R Barthel', 'Danielle L Hays', 'Erika M Yazawa', 'Matthew Opperman', 'Kempland C Walley', 'Leonardo Nimrichter', 'Monica M Burdick', 'Bryan M Gillard', 'Michael T Moser', 'Klaus Pantel', 'Barbara A Foster', 'Kenneth J Pienta', 'Charles J Dimitroff']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Cancer Res""","""['Rolling of human bone-metastatic prostate tumor cells on human bone marrow endothelium under shear flow is mediated by E-selectin.', 'Alpha 1,3 fucosyltransferases are master regulators of prostate cancer cell trafficking.', 'Human fucosyltransferase 6 enables prostate cancer metastasis to bone.', 'Dynamic process of prostate cancer metastasis to bone.', 'Integrins and bone metastasis: integrating tumor cell and stromal cell interactions.', 'Mechanobiology and survival strategies of circulating tumor cells: a process towards the invasive and metastatic phenotype.', 'Cancer metastasis chemoprevention prevents circulating tumour cells from germination.', 'Targeting HECTD3-IKKα axis inhibits inflammation-related metastasis.', 'Fucosylation in Urological Cancers.', 'Probing Intravascular Adhesion and Extravasation of Tumor Cells with Microfluidics.']"""

However, the target of this drug has remained unclear. In this study, we applied diverse strategies to identify the histone deacetylase HDAC4 as a target for the antiangiogenic activity of tasquinimod. Our comprehensive analysis revealed allosteric binding (Kd 10-30 nmol/L) to the regulatory Zn(2+) binding domain of HDAC4 that locks the protein in a conformation preventing HDAC4/N-CoR/HDAC3 complex formation. This binding inhibited colocalization of N-CoR/HDAC3, thereby inhibiting deacetylation of histones and HDAC4 client transcription factors, such as HIF-1α, which are bound at promoter/enhancers where epigenetic reprogramming is required for cancer cell survival and angiogenic response. Through this mechanism, tasquinimod is effective as a monotherapeutic agent against human prostate, breast, bladder, and colon tumor xenografts, where its efficacy could be further enhanced in combination with a targeted thapsigargin prodrug (G202) that selectively kills tumor endothelial cells.

The capacity to select from a larger range of dose rates allows the linac to maintain higher gantry speeds, resulting in faster, smoother deliveries. The purpose of this study is to investigate two components of CVDR delivery - the increase in average dose rate and gantry speed, and a determination of their effects on beam stability, MLC positioning, and overall plan dosimetry. Initially, ten VMAT plans (5 prostate, 5head and neck) were delivered to a Delta4 dosimetric phantom using both the BDR and CVDR systems. The plans were found to be dosimetrically robust using both delivery methods, although CVDR was observed to give higher gamma pass rates at the 2%/2 mm gamma level for prostates (p &lt; 0.01). For the dual arc head-and-neck plans, CVDR delivery resulted in improved pass rates at all gamma levels (2%/2 mm to 4%/4 mm) for individual arc verifications (p &lt; 0.01), but gave similar results to BDR when both arcs were combined. To investigate the impact of increased gantry speed on MLC positioning, a dynamic leaf-tracking tool was developed using the electronic portal imaging device (EPID). Comparing the detected MLC positions to those expected from the plan, CVDR was observed to result in a larger mean error compared to BDR (0.13 cm and 0.06 cm, respectively, p &lt; 0.01). The EPID images were also used to monitor beam stability during delivery. It was found that the CVDR deliveries had a lower standard deviation of the gun-target (GT) and transverse (AB) profiles (p &lt; 0.01). This study has determined that CVDR may offer a dosimetric advantage for VMAT plans. While the higher gantry speed of CVDR appears to increase deviations in MLC positioning, the relative effect on dosimetry is lower than the positive impact of a flatter and more stable beam profile.""","""['Christopher Boylan', 'Alan McWilliam', 'Emily Johnstone', 'Carl Rowbottom']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""J Appl Clin Med Phys""","""['Validation of a new control system for Elekta accelerators facilitating continuously variable dose rate.', 'Evaluation of MLC leaf positioning accuracy for static and dynamic IMRT treatments using DAVID in vivo dosimetric system.', 'Commissioning and quality assurance for VMAT delivery systems: An efficient time-resolved system using real-time EPID imaging.', 'Analysis of direct clinical consequences of MLC positional errors in volumetric-modulated arc therapy using 3D dosimetry system.', 'Beam modeling and VMAT performance with the Agility 160-leaf multileaf collimator.', 'A Comparison Study Between CNN-Based Deformed Planning CT and CycleGAN-Based Synthetic CT Methods for Improving iCBCT Image Quality.', 'Validation of a secondary dose check tool against Monte Carlo and analytical clinical dose calculation algorithms in VMAT.', 'Feasibility of a GATE Monte Carlo platform in a clinical pretreatment QA system for VMAT treatment plans using TrueBeam with an HD120 multileaf collimator.', 'VMAT linear accelerator commissioning and quality assurance: dose control and gantry speed tests.', 'Time-resolved beam symmetry measurement for VMAT commissioning and quality assurance.']"""

The influence of several parameters that may introduce systematic dose errors when performing reference dose measurements were investigated. The effect of the film storage temperature was determined by comparing the performance of three lots of GAFCHROMIC EBT2 films stored at either 4ºC or room temperature. The effect of high (&gt; 80%) or low (&lt; 20%) relative humidity was also determined. Doses measured in optimal conditions with EBT and EBT2 films were then compared with an A12 ionization chamber measurement. Intensity-modulated radiation therapy quality controls using EBT2 films were also performed in reference dose. The results obtained using reference dose measurements were compared with those obtained using relative dose measurements. Storing the film at 4ºC improves the stability of the film over time, but does not eliminate the noncatalytic film development, seen as a rise in optical density over time in the absence of radiation. Relative humidity variations ranging from 80% to 20% have a strong impact on the optical density and could introduce dose errors of up to 15% if the humidity were not controlled during the film storage period. During the scanning procedure, the film temperature influences the optical density that is measured. When controlling for these three parameters, the dose differences between EBT or EBT2 and the A12 chamber are found to be within ± 4% (2σ level) over a dose range of 20-350 cGy.

For all cases investigated, plan metrics such as conformity indices and dose homogeneity indices increased, while plan QA decreased with increasing leaf speed. Leaf speed had a significant impact on the segment size for low dose per fractionation cases. Constraining leaf motion to a lower speed not only avoids tiny large leaf travel and low-dose rate value, but also achieves better PTV coverage (defined as the volume receiving prescription dose) with less total MUs. Maximum delivery time, the number of arcs, and the spacing of control points all had similar effects as the leaf motion constraint on dose rate and segment size. The maximum delivery time had a significant effect on the optimization, acting as a hard constraint. Increasing the control point spacing from 2 to 6 degrees increased the PTV coverage, but reduced the absolute dose gamma passing rate.

Patients and methods:   We analysed data on the stage at diagnosis of East of England patients diagnosed with any of 10 common cancers, 2006-2010. Stage information was available on 88 657 of 98 942 tumours (89.6%).  Results:   Substantial socio-demographic inequalities in advanced stage at diagnosis (i.e. stage III/IV) existed for seven cancers, but their magnitude and direction varied greatly by cancer: advanced stage at diagnosis was more likely for older patients with melanoma but less likely for older patients with lung cancer [odds ratios for 75-79 versus 65-69 1.60 (1.38-1.86) and 0.83 (0.77-0.89), respectively]. Deprived patients were more likely to be diagnosed in advanced stage for melanoma, prostate, endometrial and (female) breast cancer: odds ratios (most versus least deprived quintile) from 2.24 (1.66-3.03) for melanoma to 1.31 (1.15-1.49) for breast cancer.

Methods:   The expression of each receptor was immunohistochemically examined in 114 formalin-fixed biopsy specimens. Correlations with clinicopathologic features were investigated in these specimens. Angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis were measured by the percentage of CD34-stained vessels (microvessel density) and D2-40-stained vessels (lymph vessel density). The relationships between the density of each EPR-stained cells and the microvessel density or lymph vessel density were evaluated in 62 prostate cancer tissues obtained by radical surgery for more detailed analysis in a wider area of prostate cancer tissue.  Results:   The density of tumor-associated cells with EP2R expression was positively associated with the N (P<.001) and M (P=.002) stages. Similarly, EP3R-positive stromal cell density was significantly associated with the N (P=.033) and M (P=.026) stages. The density of EP2R- and EP3R-stained cells correlated with the microvessel density (r=0.42, P<.001) and lymph vessel density (r=0.36, P=.012), respectively. A greater density of EP2R-stained cells was recognized as an independent predictor of progression (hazard ratio 7.26, P=.002) on multivariate analysis.  Conclusion:   EP2R- and EP3R-stained cells might play important roles in tumor progression, angiogenesis, and lymphangiogenesis in prostate cancer. The density of EP2R-stained stromal cells could offer a useful predictor of biochemical recurrence after radical surgery.""","""['Yasuyoshi Miyata', 'Kojiro Ohba', 'Tomohiro Matsuo', 'Shin-Ichi Watanabe', 'Tomayoshi Hayashi', 'Hideki Sakai', 'Hiroshi Kanetake']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Urology""","""['Relationship between prostaglandin E2 receptors and clinicopathologic features in human prostate cancer tissue.', 'Roles of prostaglandin E2-EP3/EP4 receptor signaling in the enhancement of lymphangiogenesis during fibroblast growth factor-2-induced granulation formation.', 'Significance of divergent expression of prostaglandin EP4 and EP3 receptors in human prostate cancer.', 'Novel prostaglandin receptor modulators--part II: EP receptor modulators; a patent review (2002 - 2012).', 'Prognostic markers in clinically localized prostate cancer.', 'Oral administration of E-type prostanoid (EP) 1 receptor antagonist suppresses carcinogenesis and development of prostate cancer via upregulation of apoptosis in an animal model.', 'Calcitriol and cancer therapy: A missed opportunity.', 'Inhibition of Ep3 attenuates migration and promotes apoptosis of non-small cell lung cancer cells via suppression of TGF-β/Smad signaling.', 'Vitamin D in prostate cancer.', 'Prostaglandin E2-EP2 signaling as a node of chronic inflammation in the colon tumor microenvironment.']"""

The objective of this study is to 1) examine the effects of a prostate cancer screening intervention to promote SDM and 2) determine whether framing prostate information in the context of other clearly beneficial men's health services affects decisions.  Methods:   We conducted two separate randomized controlled trials of the same prostate cancer intervention (with or without additional information on more clearly beneficial men's health services). For each trial, we enrolled a convenience sample of 2 internal medicine practices, and their interested physicians and male patients with no prior history of prostate cancer (for a total of 4 practices, 28 physicians, and 128 men across trials). Within each practice site, we randomized men to either 1) a video-based decision aid and researcher-led coaching session or 2) a highway safety video. Physicians at each site received a 1-hour educational session on prostate cancer and SDM. To assess intervention effects, we measured key components of SDM, intent to be screened, and actual screening. After finding that results did not vary by trial, we combined data across sites, adjusting for the random effects of both practice and physician.  Results:   Compared to an attention control, our prostate cancer screening intervention increased men's perceptions that screening is a decision (absolute difference +41%; 95% CI 25 to 57%) and men's knowledge about prostate cancer screening (absolute difference +34%; 95% CI 19% to 50%), but had no effect on men's self-reported participation in shared decisions or their participation at their preferred level. Overall, the intervention decreased screening intent (absolute difference -34%; 95% CI -50% to -18%) and actual screening rates (absolute difference -22%; 95% CI -38 to -7%) with no difference in effect by frame.  Conclusions:   SDM interventions can increase men's knowledge, alter their perceptions of prostate cancer screening, and reduce actual screening. However, they may not guarantee an increase in shared decisions.

We have therefore investigated the anti-proliferative effects of ENL in an in vitro model of prostate tumourigenesis at concentrations reported to occur in a range of male populations.  Methods and results:   The effects of 0.1 and 1 μM ENL on three markers of viability and proliferation (metabolic activity, growth kinetics, and cell cycle progression) were assessed in the RWPE-1, WPE1-NA22, WPE1-NB14, WPE1-NB11, WPE1-NB26, LNCaP, and PC-3 cell lines over 72 h. Based on these data, we quantified the expression levels of 12 genes involved in the control of DNA replication initiation using TaqMan real-time PCR in the WPE1-NA22, WPE1-NB14, WPE1-NB11, and WPE1-NB26 cell lines. ENL significantly inhibited the abnormal proliferation of the WPE1-NB14 and WPE1-NB11 cell lines and appears to be a consequence of decreased expression of abnormal chromatin licensing and DNA replication factor 1.

This study was undertaken to investigate the status and role of miR-34b in prostate cancer.  Experimental design:   Profiling of miR-34b was carried out in human prostate cancer cell lines and clinical samples by quantitative real-time PCR and in situ hybridization. Statistical analyses were done to assess diagnostic/prognostic potential. Biological significance was elucidated by carrying out a series of experiments in vitro and in vivo.  Results:   We report that miR-34b is silenced in human prostate cancer and the mechanism is through CpG hypermethylation. miR-34b directly targeted methyltransferases and deacetylases resulting in a positive feedback loop inducing partial demethylation and active chromatin modifications. miR-34b expression could predict overall and recurrence-free survival such that patients with high miR-34b levels had longer survival. Functionally, miR-34b inhibited cell proliferation, colony formation, migration/invasion, and triggered G(0)/G(1) cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis by directly targeting the Akt and its downstream proliferative genes. miR-34b caused a decline in the mesenchymal markers vimentin, ZO1, N-cadherin, and Snail with an increase in E-cadherin expression, thus inhibiting epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Finally we showed the antitumor effect of miR-34b in vivo. MiR-34b caused a dramatic decrease in tumor growth in nude mice compared with cont-miR.

Conclusions:   There was little evidence of associations between chlorinated solvents and cancer. Limited power precludes strong inferences about absence of risk.

A total of 115 patients with mCRPC undergoing a docetaxel q3w regimen were enrolled in this study. A survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate the prognostic value of all covariates for OS. OS was also analysed after stratifying patients according to the results of multivariate analysis. The median OS for the entire cohort was 17.0 months. The multivariate analysis showed that the prostate-specific antigen doubling time (PSADT), baseline haemoglobin (Hb) concentration, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) concentration, cycles of chemotherapy and time to castration resistance were independent prognostic factors of OS. According to the presence of PSADT <46.3 days and baseline ALP ≥ 110 IU l(-1), all patients were divided into three risk groups: low-risk group (no risk factors), intermediate-risk group (one risk factor) and high-risk group (two risk factors). Median OSs for patients in low-, intermediate- and high-risk groups were 28.0 months (95% CI: 23.8-32.2), 21.0 months (95% CI: 18.9-23.1) and 11.0 months (95% CI: 7.6-14.4), respectively (P<0.001). In conclusion, PSADT, baseline Hb concentration, ALP concentration, cycles of chemotherapy and time to castration resistance were independent prognostic factors of OS in Chinese patients with mCRPC treated with docetaxel.

It is associated with prenatal androgen exposure, and studies have evaluated the ratio as a marker for certain traits and disease states known to be associated with higher levels of in utero androgens, such as prostate cancer. There are currently no screening tools that stratify men with prostate cancer according to the severity of their disease. This study aims to investigate the 2D:4D ratio as a potential marker for prostate cancer severity. Our hypothesis was that lower digit ratios, representing higher in utero androgen exposure, would be associated with more severe disease.  Methods:   Measurements were taken of the second and fourth digits of the right hand of male patients diagnosed with prostate cancer. Gleason score, presence of metastasis, family history, age at diagnosis and race were recorded. The distribution of demographic and other patient characteristics were compared with digit ratios to determine relationships.  Results:   African-American men with prostate cancer are 3.70 times more likely to have a low 2D:4D digit ratio than Caucasian men with prostate cancer (95% confidence interval: 1.98, 6.92; P < 0.0001). There were no statistically significant differences in the presence of metastasis, Gleason score, family history or age at diagnosis by digit ratio.  Conclusion:   2D:4D ratio shows strong differences between African-Americans and Caucasians; however, it does not correlate with disease severity in men already diagnosed with prostate cancer. Although this is a small population sample with possible confounding factors, it does not provide evidence to support the hypothesis that prenatal androgens affect prostate cancer grade or progression.""","""['M Waters', 'C M Rebholz', 'B Wood', 'A Kuske', 'M McIntyre', 'O Sartor']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['Comparison of digit ratio (2D:4D) between Brazilian men with and without prostate cancer.', 'Epidemiologic study of the sexually dimorphic second to fourth digit ratio (2D:4D) and other finger ratios in Greek population.', 'Second to fourth digit ratio, body mass index, waist-to-hip ratio, and waist-to-chest ratio: their relationships in heterosexual men and women.', 'Is the Second to Fourth Digit Ratio (2D:4D) a Biomarker of Sex-Steroids Activity?', 'The digit ratio (2D:4D) in China: A meta-analysis.', 'Systematical assessment of digit ratio in a female masculinization disease: polycystic ovary syndrome.', 'The Association of Digit Ratio (2D\u2009:\u20094D) with Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'Prognostic significance of the digit ratio after hormone therapy for prostate cancer: a prospective multicenter study.', 'Comparison of digit ratio (2D:4D) between Brazilian men with and without prostate cancer.', 'Sex-different abnormalities in the right second to fourth digit ratio in Japanese individuals with autism spectrum disorders.']"""

Current tools fail to identify patients at risk of recurrence. Glutathione-S-transferases (GSTs) are involved in the metabolism of carcinogens, hormones and drugs. Thus, genetic polymorphisms that modify the GST activities may modify the risk of PCa recurrence.  Methods:   We retrospectively recruited Argentine PCa patients treated with RRP to study the association between GST polymorphisms and PCa biochemical relapse after RRP. We genotyped germline DNA in 105 patients for: GSTP1 c.313A>G (p.105 Ile>Val, rs1695) by PCR-RFLP; and GSTT1 null and GSTM1 null polymorphisms by multiplex PCR. Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazard models were used to evaluate these associations.  Results:   Patients with GSTP1 c.313GG genotype showed shorter biochemical relapse-free survival (BRFS) (P = 0.003) and higher risk for recurrence in unadjusted (Hazard ratio (HR) = 3.16, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) = 1.41-7.06, P = 0.005) and multivariate models (HR = 3.01, 95% CI = 1.13-8.02, P = 0.028). We did not find significant associations for GSTT1 and GSTM1 genotypes. In addition, we found shorter BRFS (P = 0.010) and increased risk for recurrence for patients having two or more risk alleles when we combined the genotypes of the three GSTs in multivariate models (HR = 3.06, 95% CI = 1.20-7.80, P = 0.019).  Conclusions:   Our results give support to the implementation of GSTs genotyping for personalized therapies as a novel alternative for PCa management for patients who undergo RRP. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that examined GST polymorphisms in PCa progression in Argentine men.

Methods:   This was a retrospective, observational study using the Thomson MedStat MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters database from September 2002 to June 2011. Study subjects included all persons with claims for prostate cancer and for bone metastases, and one or more claims for an SRE. Unique SRE episodes were identified based on a gap of at least 90 days without an SRE claim, and classified by treatment setting (inpatient or outpatient) and SRE type (spinal cord compression, pathological fracture, surgery to bone or radiotherapy).  Results:   Of 3919 patients with prostate cancer and bone metastases, 2090 (53%) had one or more SRE episodes. Among 1237 patients who met all other criteria, there were 1623 SRE episodes over a mean (s.d.) follow-up of 16.1 (12.9) months. The percent of episodes that required inpatient treatment ranged from 14% (radiotherapy) to 82% (surgery to bone). On average, inpatient episodes with surgery to bone (n = 36 episodes) were most costly (mean (s.e.) $88,838 ($11,830)/episode), whereas outpatient episodes with surgery to bone (n = 8 episodes) were least costly (mean (s.e.) $4749 ($1690)/episode). Of the total SRE costs (mean (s.e.) $20,984 ($951)/episode), 41% were attributable to outpatient radiotherapy (n = 1169 episodes), 23% to inpatient radiotherapy (n = 184 episodes), and 19% to inpatient treatment of pathological fractures (n = 101 episodes).

Orteronel (TAK-700), 6-[(7S)-7-hydroxy-6,7-dihydro-5H-pyrrolo[1,2-c]imidazol-7-yl]-N-methyl-2-naphthamide, is a novel, non-steroidal, selective inhibitor of the 17,20-lyase activity of CYP17A--a key enzyme in the production of steroidal hormones--and is being developed as a therapy for PC. The purpose of this study was to elucidate the inhibitory activity of orteronel, in particular its specificity for androgen synthesis enzymes, in male rats--an androgen-synthesis model that largely reflects this pathway in humans. Orteronel inhibited 17,20-lyase activity in rats with an IC(50) of 1200 nM but did not inhibit 17α-hydroxylase or 11β-hydroxylase (CYP11B1) activity in rats at concentrations up to 10 μM. In cellular steroidogenesis assays using rat testicular cells, orteronel suppressed testosterone and androstenedione production with an IC(50) of 640 nM and 210 nM, respectively, but did not suppress either corticosterone or aldosterone production in rat adrenal cells at concentrations up to 30 μM. In addition, serum testosterone and androstenedione levels in human chorionic gonadotropin-injected hypophysectomized rats were significantly reduced by single oral administration of orteronel at a dose of 30 mg/kg (both p ≤ 0.01); serum corticosterone and aldosterone levels in ACTH-injected hypophysectomized rats did not result in significant differences compared with controls, following orteronel administration at doses up to 300 mg/kg. Serum testosterone levels in intact male rats were significantly reduced by orteronel 4h after dosing at 100mg/kg (p ≤ 0.01); testosterone levels showed a tendency to recover afterward. In intact male rats, the weight of the prostate glands and seminal vesicles was decreased in a dose-dependent manner following multiple doses of orteronel at 37.5, 150, and 600 mg/kg, TID for 4 days. The reversibility of orteronel was further confirmed using a human adrenocortical tumor cell line. In summary, orteronel is a selective and reversible 17,20-lyase inhibitor, and decreases the weight of androgen-dependent organs in male rats. Our data suggests that orteronel would therefore be effective for androgen-dependent disorders such as PC.""","""['Takahito Hara', 'Jin Kouno', 'Tomohiro Kaku', 'Toshiyuki Takeuchi', 'Masami Kusaka', 'Akihiro Tasaka', 'Masuo Yamaoka']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Steroid Biochem Mol Biol""","""['Orteronel (TAK-700), a novel non-steroidal 17,20-lyase inhibitor: effects on steroid synthesis in human and monkey adrenal cells and serum steroid levels in cynomolgus monkeys.', 'Effect of an investigational CYP17A1 inhibitor, orteronel (TAK-700), on estrogen- and corticoid-synthesis pathways in hypophysectomized female rats and on the serum estradiol levels in female cynomolgus monkeys.', 'Novel nonsteroidal inhibitor of cytochrome P450(17alpha) (17alpha-hydroxylase/C17-20 lyase), YM116, decreased prostatic weights by reducing serum concentrations of testosterone and adrenal androgens in rats.', 'The hunt for a selective 17,20 lyase inhibitor; learning lessons from nature.', 'Targeting the adrenal gland in castration-resistant prostate cancer: a case for orteronel, a selective CYP-17 17,20-lyase inhibitor.', 'Non-steroidal CYP17A1 Inhibitors: Discovery and Assessment.', ""Alzheimer's Disease, and Breast and Prostate Cancer Research: Translational Failures and the Importance to Monitor Outputs and Impact of Funded Research."", 'Multistep Binding of the Non-Steroidal Inhibitors Orteronel and Seviteronel to Human Cytochrome P450 17A1 and Relevance to Inhibition of Enzyme Activity.', 'Kinetic processivity of the two-step oxidations of progesterone and pregnenolone to androgens by human cytochrome P450 17A1.', 'The importance of non-nuclear AR signaling in prostate cancer progression and therapeutic resistance.']"""

Patients and methods:   Between 2006 and 2010, 2511 consecutive patients treated with RP, with or without pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND), for prostate cancer (PCa) at a single tertiary care centre were analysed. Baseline patient characteristics and PCa risk distribution were compared according to treatment type (RRP vs RARP) in the overall population, as well as in three surgeons' initial 50 RARP and three surgeons' initial 50 RRP cases (n = 300). We used a chi-squared trend test to evaluate the differences in treatment type administration over time according to PCa characteristics. Logistic regression analyses focused on the prediction of PLND and adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) use.  Results:   Overall, 1873 (74.6%) and 638 (25.4%) patients underwent RRP and RARP, respectively. Men treated with RARP were younger (mean age: 62 vs 65 years), less obese (mean BMI: 24.8 vs 26.4 kg/m(2) ), healthier (Charlson comorbidity index = 0: 68.7 vs 53.3%) and more likely to harbour clinical low-risk PCa (51 vs 30%) than their RRP counterparts (all P < 0.001). Similar findings were observed in sub-analyses focusing on six surgeons' 50 initial patients (all P ≤ 0.02). A significant increase in the rate of patients with low-risk PCa treated with RARP vs RRP was reported over time (5 vs 95% and 66 vs 34% in 2006 and 2010, respectively). Conversely, 76% of patients with high risk PCa were still treated with RRP in 2010. Patients treated with RARP were less likely to receive PLND at RP and adjuvant RT (all P ≤ 0.01), even after adjusting for clinical and PCa characteristics.  Conclusions:   The introduction of a robotic training programme at a high volume centre led to significant patient selection in terms of clinical and PCa characteristics. When both RRP and RARP facilities are available within the same centre, patients with the most favourable clinical and cancer profile are selected to undergo RARP. Use of RARP negatively influenced the rates and the extent of PLND as well as the use of adjuvant RT after surgery.

To achieve this goal, we identify and measure variables that pertain to each gender-specific social style.  Methods and findings:   We perform social network and statistical analysis on the communication flow of 8,388 members at six different cancer forums over eight years. Kruskal-Wallis tests were conducted to measure the difference between the number of intimate (and highly intimate) dyads, relationship length, and number of communications. We determine that two patients are more likely to form an intimate bond on a gender-specific cancer forum (ovarian P = <0.0001, breast P = 0.0089, prostate P = 0.0021). Two female patients are more likely to form a highly intimate bond on a female-specific cancer forum (Ovarian P<0.0001, Breast P<0.01). Typically a male patient communicates with more members than a female patient (Ovarian forum P = 0.0406, Breast forum P = 0.0013). A relationship between two patients is longer on the gender-specific cancer forums than a connection between two members not identified as patients (ovarian forum P = 0.00406, breast forum P = 0.00013, prostate forum P = .0.0003).  Conclusion:   The high level of interconnectedness among the prostate patients supports the hypothesis that men prefer to socialize in large, interconnected, less-intimate groups. A female patient is more likely to form a highly intimate connection with another female patient; this finding is consistent with the hypothesis that woman prefer fewer, more intimate connections. The relationships of same-gender cancer patients last longer than other relationships; this finding demonstrates homophily within these online communities. Our findings regarding online communication preferences are in agreement with research findings from person-to-person communication preference studies.

Materials and methods:   The data of 126 patients operated on for PC were retrospectively reviewed. No patient had previously received 5α-reductase inhibitor, luteinizing hormone (LH)-releasing hormone analogs or testosterone replacement treatment. The patient population was grouped according to the prostatectomy Gleason score (pGS) as 6=3+3, 7=3+4, 7=4+3 and 8-10. Twelve variables were simultaneously investigated in each group: age, prolactin (PRL), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), LH, total testosterone (TT), free testosterone (FT), estradiol (Er), prostate specific antigen (PSA), percentage of prostate biopsy positive cores (P+), biopsy Gleason score (bGS), overall cancer volume estimated as percentage of prostate volume (V+) and prostate weight (Wi). Univariate analysis of variance (ANOVA), multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) and multivariate discriminant analysis were the statistical methods used for evaluating the data.  Results:   There were 38 patients in pGS 6=3+3, 57 in pGS 7=3+4, 15 in pGS 7=4+3 and 16 in pGS 8-10. ANOVA showed that bGS (p<0.0001), P+ (p<0.0001), V+ (p<0.0001), PSA (p=0.02), Wi (p=0.001) and TT (p=0.04) were significantly different in the four pGS groups.

Tumor emboli were seen inside the tumor (8%), at the front edge of the tumor (30%), separated from the tumor (32%), and distant from the tumor (30%). Tumor emboli were more frequent per case and more often in an extraprostatic location in lymph node-positive cases (P<0.05). One hundred thirty-four emboli were in a single thin-walled vessel, 227 were in a thin-walled vessel next to an artery, and 3 were seen inside an artery. Twenty-eight tumor emboli were attached to a vessel wall, 18 had proteinaceous material in the vascular lumen, and 14 were surrounded by erythrocytes. The following mimickers were seen: retraction artifact and perineural invasion-all cases; cancer impinging upon vascular space-45 foci; tangential sections of endothelium-10 foci; displacement of benign and collapsed malignant glands-16 and 27 foci, respectively; retraction with erythrocytes-3 cases; intravascular degenerating tumor cells-3 foci; malignant glands in atrophic ducts-4 foci; and myofibroblastic proliferation in thrombosed vessels-2 foci. In 50 stained blocks, CD31 and D2-40 immunostaining studies confirmed all lymphovascular invasions diagnosed by hematoxylin and eosin staining and demonstrated emboli in 47 lymphatic and 16 blood vessels. In summary, the current study identifies features of true lymphovascular invasion and how to distinguish them from mimickers on routine hematoxylin and eosin sections.""","""['Oleksandr N Kryvenko', 'Jonathan I Epstein']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Am J Surg Pathol""","""['Lymphovascular invasion is an independent prognostic factor in prostatic adenocarcinoma.', 'Prediction of lymphatic invasion by peritumoral lymphatic vessel density in prostate biopsy cores.', 'Prediction of biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy using peritumoral lymphatic vessel density in biopsy specimens in patients with localized prostate cancer.', 'Lymphovascular invasion as a prognostic tool for advanced bladder cancer.', 'Prognostic significance of tumor volume in radical prostatectomy and needle biopsy specimens.', 'Blood Vessel Invasion in Endometrial Cancer Is One of the Mechanisms of Spread to the Cervix.', 'Utility of ERG Immunohistochemistry for Evaluation of Lymphovascular Invasion in Testicular Germ Cell Tumors: A Retrospective Pilot Study.', 'Impact of lymphovascular invasion on lymph node metastasis for patients undergoing radical prostatectomy with negative resection margin.', 'Histopathology of Prostate Cancer.', 'Utility of Clinical Risk Stratification in the Selection of Muscle-Invasive Bladder Cancer Patients for Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy: A Retrospective Cohort Study.']"""

Little research has studied the distress men experience as a normal response to PCa, or how they manage this distress during the early stages of the illness.  Objectives:   The objective of this study was to explore the experience of men diagnosed with localized PCa during their first postdiagnostic year.  Methods:   This constructivist qualitative study interviewed 8 men between the ages of 44 and 77 years, in their homes, on 2 occasions during the first 3 postdiagnostic months. Individual, in-depth semistructured interviews were used to collect the data.  Results:   After an initial feeling of shock, the men in this study worked diligently to camouflage their experience of distress through hiding and attenuating their feelings and minimizing the severity of PCa.  Conclusions:   Men silenced distress because they believed it was expected of them. Maintaining silence allowed men to protect their strong and stoic self-image. This stereotype, of the strong and stoic man, prevented men from expressing their feelings of distress and from seeking support from family and friends and health professionals.  Implications for practice:   It is important for nurses to acknowledge and recognize the normal distress experienced by men as a result of a PCa diagnosis. Hence, nurses must learn to identify the ways in which men avoid expressing their distress and develop early supportive relationships that encourage them to express and subsequently manage it.""","""['David P Wall', 'Linda J Kristjanson', 'Colleen Fisher', 'Duncan Boldy', 'Garth E Kendall']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Cancer Nurs""","""[""Prospective study of men's psychological and decision-related adjustment after treatment for localized prostate cancer."", 'Confronting the unexpected: temporal, situational, and attributive dimensions of distressing symptom experience for breast cancer survivors.', 'A prospective study of the use of alternative therapies by men with localized prostate cancer.', 'Symptoms and symptom distress in localized prostate cancer.', ""Men's experiences of deciding about treatment for localized prostate cancer: a meta-synthesis."", 'Supportive care needs of men with prostate cancer: A systematic review update.', 'Body image, self-esteem, and sense of masculinity in patients with prostate cancer: a qualitative meta-synthesis.', 'Negative recollections regarding doctor-patient interactions among men receiving a prostate cancer diagnosis: a qualitative study of patient experiences in Japan.', 'Beliefs that contribute to delays in diagnosis of prostate cancer among Afro-Caribbean men in Trinidad and Tobago.', 'Prostate care and prostate cancer from the perspectives of undiagnosed men: a systematic review of qualitative research.']"""

Materials and methods:   Between 2006 and 2012, we prospectively enrolled 1,018 men with no history of CaP undergoing prostate biopsy. The risk of detecting poorly differentiated CaP as a function of CgA concentration was evaluated using crude and adjusted logistic regressions. Further analyses were performed to determine whether CgA was a significant predictor of high-grade CaP in men with low PSA (<10 ng/ml).  Results:   We found a significantly higher level of CgA in men with poorly differentiated CaP. CgA was however co-linear with age, and serum CgA levels were not significantly associated with the overall risk of CaP, and the specific risk of poorly differentiated CaP (OR 1.001 95% CI 0.99-1.01, P = 0.74). Moreover, in men with low PSA levels (<10 ng/ml), CgA was not a significant predictor of high grade-disease on univariate (OR 1.00; 95% CI 0.99-1.01; P = 0.66) and multivariate analysis (P = 0.85).  Conclusions:   In our cohort of patients, the serum level of CgA is not a significant predictor of poorly differentiated CaP on initial prostate biopsy, even in men with low PSA levels (<10 ng/ml).

Co-factors, the co-repressors, or the co-activators are responsible for the regulation of AR activation. The pro-oncogene human Long Interspersed Nucleotide acid Element-1 (LINE-1) encodes LINE-1 ORF-1p and plays important roles in the development and progression of several human carcinomas. In this study, the results showed that LINE-1 ORF-1p increased the AR transcriptional activity and in turn enhanced the expression of prostate specific antigen (PSA) in the presence of R1881. A physical protein-protein interaction between the AR signaling and the LINE-1 ORF-1p was identified by the immunoprecipitation assays and GST pull-down assays. Furthermore, LINE-1 ORF-1p would function as a novel AR positive co-regulator through modulating its cytoplasm/nucleus translocation and the recruitment to the androgen response element in the PSA gene promoter. Our date also showed that the LINE-1 ORF-1p promoted the proliferation and anchor-independent growth of LNCaP (ligand dependent) and PC-3 (ligand independent) human prostatic carcinoma cells.

To test the hypothesis that SIO inhibits prostate cancer by inducing apoptosis, the effects of SIO on the proliferation of three human prostate cancer cell lines were examined using a CCK-8 assay. SIO significantly inhibited the proliferation of DU-145, PC-3 and LNCaP cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Flow cytometry studies showed that exposing DU-145, PC-3 and LNCaP cells to 5, 10, or 15 mg/mL SIO for 24 h increased the percentage of the early-stage apoptotic cells from 11.84% to 38.26% (DU-145), 22.76% to 39.96% (PC-3) and 5.05% to 16.11% (LNCaP), respectively. In addition, typical morphologic changes were observed in the cells with acridine orange/ethidium bromide staining. SIO treatment induced strong S and G₂/M phase cell cycle arrest in a dose-dependent manner in DU-145 and LNCaP. In contrast, SIO treatment induced strong Sub G₁ and G₀/G₁ phase cell cycle arrest in a dose-dependent manner in PC-3. SIO exposure for 24 h decreased the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and increased the expression of the apoptogenic protein Bax. Moreover, the Bax/Bcl-2expression ratio was increased. Concurrently, the expression of caspase-3 was upregulated. These data support our hypothesis that SIO has anticarcinogenic properties.""","""['Fangfang Huang', 'Zuisu Yang', 'Di Yu', 'Jiabin Wang', 'Rong Li', 'Guofang Ding']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Mar Drugs""","""['Sepia Ink Oligopeptide Induces Apoptosis of Lung Cancer Cells via Mitochondrial Pathway.', 'Sepia ink oligopeptide induces apoptosis and growth inhibition in human lung cancer cells.', 'Anticancer Activity of Anthopleura anjunae Oligopeptides in Prostate Cancer DU-145 Cells.', 'SRJ23, a new semisynthetic andrographolide derivative: in vitro growth inhibition and mechanisms of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in prostate cancer cells.', 'Paris saponin I induces apoptosis via increasing the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and caspase-3 expression in gefitinib-resistant non-small cell lung cancer in vitro and in vivo.', 'Activity Changes of the Peptic Lactoferrin Hydrolysate in Human Gastric Cancer AGS Cells in Response to Cu(II) or Mn(II) Addition.', 'Insights into Common Octopus (Octopus vulgaris) Ink Proteome and Bioactive Peptides Using Proteomic Approaches.', 'Therapeutic Potential of Marine Peptides in Prostate Cancer: Mechanistic Insights.', 'Preparation of Nereid oligopeptide and investigation of the mechanism underlying the induction of apoptosis in human lung cancer H1299 cells.', 'Recent Advances in Small Peptides of Marine Origin in Cancer Therapy.']"""

Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) is a NAD+-dependent class III histone deacetylase that has been linked to gene silencing, control of the cell cycle, apoptosis, and energy homeostasis. In prostate cancer, SIRT1 is required for androgen antagonist-mediated transcriptional repression and growth suppression of prostate cancer cells. Whether SIRT1 plays a similar role in the actions of estrogen or antagonists had not been determined. We report here that SIRT1 represses the transcriptional and proliferative response of breast cancer cells to estrogens, and this repression is ERα dependent. Inhibition of SIRT1 activity results in the phosphorylation of ERα in an AKT-dependent manner, and this activation requires phosphoinositide 3-kinase activity. Phosphorylated ERα subsequently accumulates in the nucleus, where ERα binds DNA ER-responsive elements and activates transcription of estrogen-responsive genes. This ER-dependent transcriptional activation augments estrogen-induced signaling, but also activates ER signaling in the absence of estrogen, thus defining a novel and unexpected mechanism of ligand-independent ERα-mediated activation and target gene transcription. Like ligand-dependent activation of ERα, SIRT1 inhibition-mediated ERα activation in the absence of estrogen also results in breast cancer cell proliferation. Together, these data demonstrate that SIRT1 regulates the most important cell signaling pathway for the growth of breast cancer cells, both in the presence and the absence of estrogen.""","""['Robert L Moore', 'Douglas V Faller']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Endocrinol""","""['SIRT1 is involved in oncogenic signaling mediated by GPER in breast cancer.', 'Inhibition of SIRT1 deacetylase suppresses estrogen receptor signaling.', 'Reciprocal roles of DBC1 and SIRT1 in regulating estrogen receptor α activity and co-activator synergy.', 'Molecular mechanisms of estrogen action: selective ligands and receptor pharmacology.', 'The Interplay between the Cellular Response to DNA Double-Strand Breaks and Estrogen.', 'The sirtuin family in health and disease.', 'The Mechanistic Roles of Sirtuins in Breast and Prostate Cancer.', 'Identifying and Validating of an Autophagy-Related Gene Signature for the Prediction of Early Relapse in Breast Cancer.', 'Ceruloplasmin correlates with immune infiltration and serves as a prognostic biomarker in breast cancer.', 'Combined Luteolin and Indole-3-Carbinol Synergistically Constrains ERα-Positive Breast Cancer by Dual Inhibiting Estrogen Receptor Alpha and Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4/6 Pathway in Cultured Cells and Xenograft Mice.']"""

Materials and methods:   We retrospectively reviewed 355 initial staging abdominopelvic contrast-enhanced CT examinations conducted from January 2000 to December 2010 in patients with prostate cancer for incidental findings that were not related to prostate cancer. A finding was judged to be potentially significant if therapeutic intervention, additional imaging, or tissue sampling was deemed advisable. The rate of incidental findings was correlated to patients' age and stratified prostate cancer risk groups.  Results:   We found 779 incidental finding in 292 patients (82.3%), of which 75 findings in 73 patients (20.6%) were potentially significant. Indeterminate masses were the most prevalent significant finding (n = 62). Synchronous malignancy was detected in 21 patients (5.9%). Kidney cancer (n = 7 [1.97%]) was the most common malignancy, followed by lymphoma (n = 4 [1.13%]). Staging of the cancers revealed that 15 patients, including all of those with renal cancer, had N0M0 disease. Significant vascular abnormalities were reported in six cases. Additionally, significant findings, synchronous malignancies in particular, were identified at a higher rate in patients older than 65 years. However, no significant differences were noticed between the different prostate cancer risk groups.  Conclusion:   Abdominal contrast-enhanced CT for initial staging of prostate cancer shows a considerable prevalence of incidental vascular events and synchronous cancers, with kidney cancers being the most common. Notably, 71.5% of these malignancies were at early stage. Our results show an incremental value of CT in prostate cancer staging, with an emphasis on focused evaluation of the kidneys.""","""['Azadeh Elmi', 'Shahin Tabatabaei', 'Saman Shafaat Talab', 'Sandeep S Hedgire', 'Kai Cao', 'Mukesh Harisinghani']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""AJR Am J Roentgenol""","""['Incidental detection of synchronous primary tumours during staging workup for prostate cancer.', 'Quantifying downstream impact of inappropriate staging imaging in a cohort of veterans with low- and intermediate-risk incident prostate cancer.', 'Incidence and significance of nonaneurysmal-related computed tomography scan findings in patients undergoing endovascular aortic aneurysm repair.', 'Cross-section diagnosis of tumors of the kidney and prostate gland: CT and MRI.', 'FDG in Urologic Malignancies.', 'Prevalence and clinical significance of incidental findings on multiparametric prostate MRI.', 'Locally advanced prostate cancer imaging findings and implications for treatment from the surgical perspective.', 'What Is the Clinical Importance of Incidental Findings on Staging CT Scans in Patients With Sarcoma?', 'Incidental bladder cancers found on multiparametric MRI of the prostate gland: a single center experience.', 'Relevance of computerized tomography in the preoperative evaluation of patients with vulvar cancer: a prospective study.']"""

Methods:   We used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) -Medicare linked databases to analyze claims data for 202,299 patients dying as a result of lung, breast, prostate, colorectal, and pancreas cancers from 2000 to 2007. Logistic regression modeling was used to conduct adjusted analyses of potential impacts of demographic, health services, and treatment-related variables on receipt of RT and treatment with greater than 10 days of RT. Costs were calculated in 2009 dollars.  Results:   Among the 15,287 patients (7.6%) who received RT in the last month of life, its use was associated with nonclinical factors such as race, gender, income, and hospice care. Of these patients, 2,721 (17.8%) received more than 10 days of treatment. Nonclinical factors that were associated with greater likelihood of receiving more than 10 days of RT in the last 30 days of life included: non-Hispanic white race, no receipt of hospice care, and treatment in a freestanding, versus a hospital-associated facility. Hospice care was associated with 32% decrease in total costs of care in the last month of life among those receiving RT.  Conclusion:   Although utilization of RT overall was low, almost one in five of patients who received RT in their final 30 days of life spent more than 10 of those days receiving treatment.

Serum PSA concentrations vary in the population, with PCa patients generally showing higher PSA concentrations than control individuals, although a small proportion of individuals in the population display very low PSA concentrations. We hypothesized that very low PSA concentrations might reflect gene-inactivating mutations in KLK3 that lead to abnormally reduced gene expression.  Methods:   We have sequenced all KLK3 exons and the promoter and searched for gross deletions or duplications in KLK3 in the 30 individuals with the lowest observed PSA concentrations in a sample of approximately 85 000 men from the Prostate Testing for Cancer and Treatment (ProtecT) study. The ProtecT study examines a community-based population of men from across the UK with little prior PSA testing.  Results:   We observed no stop codons or frameshift mutations, but we did find 30 single-base genetic variants, including 3 variants not described previously. These variants included missense variants that could be functionally inactivating and splicing variants. At this stage, however, we cannot confidently conclude whether these variants markedly lower PSA concentration or activity. More importantly, we identified 3 individuals with different large heterozygous deletions that encompass all KLK3 exons. The absence of a functional copy of KLK3 in these individuals is consistent with their reduced serum PSA concentrations.

This observation was further validated in two additional separate cohorts of microdissected tumours (total of n=10 benign and n=58 tumours) with specific downregulation of SPRED2 particularly in higher grade tumours. In functional assays, SPRED2 overexpression reduced ERK phosphorylation and inhibited prostate cancer cell proliferation and migration in response to different growth factors and full-media stimulation (P<0.001).

Results:   From 64 separate 3D-WMRP lesions, 25 had significant volume (mean 1.13 cm(3)) and 39 were insignificant (mean 0.09 cm(3)) (P < 0.0001); 18/64 lesions were missed by TPMB, but only one was clinically significant with GS-8 (0.02 cm(3)). When comparing the cumulative GS of TPMB versus RP, 72% (n = 18) had identical scores, 12% (n = 3) were upgraded, and only 16% (n = 4) were downgraded. Laterality of TPMB and RP was strongly correlated, 80% same laterality, 4% were up-staged, and 16% down-staged.  Conclusions:   Our clinical-pathology correlation showed very high accuracy of TPMB with a 5-mm grid template to detect clinically significant PCa lesions as compared with 3D-WMRP, providing physicians and patients with a reliable assessment of grade and stage of disease and the opportunity to choose the most appropriate therapeutic options.""","""['E David Crawford', 'Kyle O Rove', 'Al B Barqawi', 'Paul D Maroni', 'Priya N Werahera', 'Craig A Baer', 'Hari K Koul', 'Cory A Rove', 'M Scott Lucia', 'Francisco G La Rosa']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Magnetic resonance imaging-transectal ultrasound image-fusion biopsies accurately characterize the index tumor: correlation with step-sectioned radical prostatectomy specimens in 135 patients.', 'Pathological Concordance between Prostate Biopsies and Radical Prostatectomy Using Transperineal Sector Mapping Biopsies: Validation and Comparison with Transrectal Biopsies.', 'Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and MRI-Transrectal Ultrasound Fusion Biopsy for Index Tumor Detection: Correlation with Radical Prostatectomy Specimen.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Is transperineal prostate biopsy more accurate than transrectal biopsy in determining final Gleason score and clinical risk category?

Tumour protein p53 (TP53) gene increases the fidelity of DNA replication and homologous recombination by transcriptional transactivation of mismatch repair (MMR) genes. DNA repair thus has a potential role in molecular carcinogenesis of CaP. The aim of the present study was to identify mutations, and polymorphisms in TP53 gene and MMR protein expression in CaP in Indian male population.  Methods:   TP53 codon 72 polymorphism was analysed in 105 CaP, 120 benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) cases and 106 normal controls. Mutational analysis of TP53 was done in DNA extracted from formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue of 80 CaP and 24 BPH cases. Expression of MMR proteins viz. hMLH1, hMSH2, hPMS1 and hPMS2 was studied in 80 CaP, 15 prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) and 15 BPH cases.  Results:   A somatic C/A variation at the intronic boundary of exon 7 in TP53 gene was observed in one each biopsy samples from CaP and BPH. A significant association of codon 72 TP53 Pro/Pro genotype was observed with the risk of CaP (OR, 2.59, P=0.02) and BPH (OR, 6.27, P<0.001). Immunohistochemical analysis of MMR proteins showed maximum loss of hPMS1 expression in cases of CaP and PIN while no loss in expression of MMR proteins was observed in BPH cases. The study also identified a significant loss of hPMS2 protein in poorly differentiated tumours (Gleason score >7) than in well differentiated tumours (Gleason score 3-6) (P<0.05).  Interpretation & conclusions:   The results of the present study demonstrate that TP53 codon 72 polymorphism plays significant role in the pathogenesis and susceptibility to CaP and BPH. Also, an aberrant MMR protein expression could be involved in progression of prostate cancer through PIN, early CaP to aggressive CaP. The loss of hPMS2 protein expression may serve as a marker for progression of CaP.""","""['Anju Bansal', 'Abha Soni', 'Punita Rao', 'L C Singh', 'Ashwani Kumar Mishra', 'N K Mohanty', 'Sunita Saxena']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Indian J Med Res""","""['Gene expression profile and mutational analysis of DNA mismatch repair genes in carcinoma prostate in Indian population.', 'Mutations in mismatch repair genes are involved in the neoplastic transformation of human breast epithelial cells.', 'Loss of mismatch repair activity in simian virus 40 large T antigen-immortalized BPH-1 human prostatic epithelial cell line.', 'Molecular basis of HNPCC: mutations of MMR genes.', 'Alterations of the TP53 gene in gastric and esophageal carcinogenesis.', 'Mitochondria Dysfunction-Mediated Molecular Subtypes and Gene Prognostic Index for Prostate Cancer Patients Undergoing Radical Prostatectomy or Radiotherapy.', 'Association between TP53 gene codon72 polymorphism and prostate cancer risk: A systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Association between the rs1042522 polymorphism in TP53 and prostate cancer risk: An updated meta-analysis.', 'Loss of heterozygosity for chromosomal regions 15q14-21.1, 17q21.31, and 13q12.3-13.1 and its relevance for prostate cancer.', 'Functional role of DNA mismatch repair gene PMS2 in prostate cancer cells.']"""

Changes in Mg(2+) concentration have been shown to alter cell proliferation in various cells; however, the mechanism and the ion channel(s) involved have not yet been identified. Here we demonstrate that TRPM7 is expressed in control and prostate cancer cells. Supplementation of intracellular Mg-ATP or addition of external 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate inhibited MagNuM currents. Furthermore, silencing of TRPM7 inhibited whereas overexpression of TRPM7 increased endogenous MagNuM currents, suggesting that these currents are dependent on TRPM7. Importantly, although an increase in the serum Ca(2+)/Mg(2+) ratio facilitated Ca(2+) influx in both control and prostate cancer cells, a significantly higher Ca(2+) influx was observed in prostate cancer cells. TRPM7 expression was also increased in cancer cells, but its expression was not dependent on the Ca(2+)/Mg(2+) ratio per se. Additionally, an increase in the extracellular Ca(2+)/Mg(2+) ratio led to a significant increase in cell proliferation of prostate cancer cells when compared with control cells. Consistent with these results, age-matched prostate cancer patients also showed a subsequent increase in the Ca(2+)/Mg(2+) ratio and TRPM7 expression. Altogether, we provide evidence that the TRPM7 channel has an important role in prostate cancer and have identified that the Ca(2+)/Mg(2+) ratio could be essential for the initiation/progression of prostate cancer.""","""['Yuyang Sun', 'Senthil Selvaraj', 'Archana Varma', 'Susan Derry', 'Abe E Sahmoun', 'Brij B Singh']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Biol Chem""","""['Cholesterol-induced activation of TRPM7 regulates cell proliferation, migration, and viability of human prostate cells.', 'Transient receptor potential melastatin 7-like current in human head and neck carcinoma cells: role in cell proliferation.', 'TGFβ-induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in prostate cancer cells is mediated via TRPM7 expression.', 'Oncogenic role and therapeutic target of transient receptor potential melastatin 7 channel in malignancy.', 'The Mg2+ and Mg(2+)-nucleotide-regulated channel-kinase TRPM7.', 'STEAP1 Knockdown Decreases the Sensitivity of Prostate Cancer Cells to Paclitaxel, Docetaxel and Cabazitaxel.', 'Calcium signalling pathways in prostate cancer initiation and progression.', 'On the modulation of TRPM channels: Current perspectives and anticancer therapeutic implications.', 'Involvement of TRPM7 in Alcohol-Induced Damage of the Blood-Brain Barrier in the Presence of HIV Viral Proteins.', 'Plasma Micronutrient Profile of Prostate Cancer Cases Is Altered Relative to Healthy Controls-Results of a Pilot Study in South Australia.']"""

It has been proposed as a preventative agent for several types of early neoplastic lesions. Earlier studies have shown that sensitivity of prostatic carcinoma (PCa) to celecoxib is associated with apoptosis; however, these studies have not demonstrated adequately whether this effect is dependent on p53 status. We studied the relation between sensitivity to celecoxib and the phenotypic p53 status of PCa cells lines, LNCaP (wild type p53), PC3 (null p53) and DU145 (mutated p53). Cellular growth was assessed at 24, 48, 72 and 96 h after celecoxib treatment at concentrations of 0, 10, 30, 50, 70 and 100 μM using an MTT assay. Cellular proliferation (Ki-67 expression) was determined by immunocytochemistry. Phenotypic expression of p53 was analyzed by western blotting. The effects of celecoxib on cellular growth and its association with p53 were assessed after down-regulation of p53 using synthetic interfering RNAs (siRNA) in LNCaP cells. Expression of p53 and COX-2 at mRNA levels was assessed by quantitative real time polymerase reaction (qRT-PCR). We found that celecoxib inhibited cellular growth and proliferation in a dose-dependent manner in all three cell lines; LNCaP cells with a native p53 were the most sensitive to celecoxib. We observed a down- regulation effect on p53 in LNCaP cells exposed to ≥ 30 μM celecoxib for 72 h, but found no significant changes in the p53 levels of DU145 cells, which have a mutated p53. Reduced COX-2 expression was found with decreased p53 in LNCaP and PC-3 cells that were exposed to ≥ 20 μM of celecoxib for 72 h, but COX-2 expression was increased in DU145 cells. All three cell lines demonstrated pan-cytotoxicity when exposed to 100 μM celecoxib. When p53 expression was inhibited using siRNA in LNCaP cells, the inhibitory effects on cellular growth usually exerted by celecoxib were not changed significantly. Celecoxib reduces the growth of prostate cancer cell lines in part by decreasing proliferation, which suggests that the inhibition of growth of LNCaP cells by celecoxib is independent of normal levels of native p53.""","""['V R Katkoori', 'K Manne', 'V S Vital-Reyes', 'C Rodríguez-Burford', 'C Shanmugam', 'M Sthanam', 'U Manne', 'C Chatla', 'S A Abdulkadir', 'W E Grizzle']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Biotech Histochem""","""['Inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 activity by celecoxib does not lead to radiosensitization of human prostate cancer cells in vitro.', 'EP2 signaling mediates suppressive effects of celecoxib on androgen receptor expression and cell proliferation in prostate cancer.', 'Celecoxib inhibits prostate cancer growth: evidence of a cyclooxygenase-2-independent mechanism.', 'Compositions for treatment of cancer and inflammation.', 'Celecoxib and ion channels: a story of unexpected discoveries.', 'Celecoxib upregulates ULBP-1 expression in lung cancer cells via the JNK/PI3K signaling pathway and increases susceptibility to natural killer cell cytotoxicity.', 'The molecular targets of diclofenac differs from ibuprofen to induce apoptosis and epithelial mesenchymal transition due to alternation on oxidative stress management p53 independently in PC3 prostate cancer cells.', 'Effects of Celecoxib and Low-dose Aspirin on Outcomes in Adjuvant Aromatase Inhibitor-Treated Patients: CCTG MA.27.', 'Evidence to Support the Anti-Cancer Effect of Olive Leaf Extract and Future Directions.', 'Anti-tumor enhancement of Fei-Liu-Ping ointment in combination with celecoxib via cyclooxygenase-2-mediated lung metastatic inflammatory microenvironment in Lewis lung carcinoma xenograft mouse model.']"""

It was a population-based cross sectional study comprising 400 subjects at each site. In addition to socio-demographic data, history of the present and past medical illness, practice history of prostatic cancer examination, family history of cancer prostate; participants were inquired about their knowledge and attitude towards prostate cancer and screening behavior using two different likert scales. The percentage of participants who practiced regular prostate check up ranged from 8-30%. They had poor knowledge and fair attitude towards prostate cancer screening behavior, where the mean total knowledge score was 10.25±2.5, 10.76±3.39 and 11.24±3.39 whereas the mean total attitude score was 18.3±4.08, 20.68±6.4 and 17.96±5.3 for Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Jordan respectively. The respondents identified the physicians as the main sources of this information (62.4%), though they were not the main motives for regular checkup. Knowledge was the only significant predictor for participants' attitude in the multiple regression models. Participants' attitudes depends mainly on level of knowledge and quantity of information provided to the patients and their families. Such attitudes should rely on a solid background of proper information and motivation from physicians to enhance and empower behaviors towards prostate cancer screening practices.""","""['Mostafa A Arafa', 'Danny M Rabah', 'Iman H Wahdan']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Asian Pac J Cancer Prev""","""['Early Detection of Prostate Cancer: Self-Reported Knowledge and Attitude of Physicians in Jordan.', 'Knowledge and attitude of the population toward cancer prostate Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Knowledge, barriers and attitudes towards breast cancer mammography screening in jordan.', 'Enhancing Knowledge, Beliefs, and Intention to Screen for Prostate Cancer via Different Health Educational Interventions: a Literature Review.', 'With increasing trends of prostate cancer in the Saudi Arabia and Arab World: Should we start screening programs?', 'Public Knowledge, Practice, and Attitude Regarding Cancer Screening: A Community-Based Study in Saudi Arabia.', 'Variables Associated with False-Positive PSA Results: A Cohort Study with Real-World Data.', 'Early Detection of Prostate Cancer: Self-Reported Knowledge and Attitude of Physicians in Jordan.', 'The association between the knowledge on prostate cancer screening with the beliefs and behaviors of Saudi men attending King Khalid University Hospital.', 'Awareness about prostate cancer and its screening in Medina, Jeddah, and Makkah, Saudi Arabia population.']"""

Invasion in this system reflects the prevalence of HA in connective tissues and its role in the promotion of cancer cell motility and tissue invasion, making the system ideal to study invasion through bone marrow or other HA-rich connective tissues. The bio-compatible cross-linking process we used allows for direct encapsulation of cancer cells within the gel where they adopt a distinct, cluster-like morphology. Metastatic PCa cells in these hydrogels develop fingerlike structures, ""invadopodia"", consistent with their invasive properties. The number of invadopodia, as well as cluster size, shape, and convergence, can provide a quantifiable measure of invasive potential. Among candidate hyaluronan interacting proteins that could be responsible for the behavior we observed, we found that culture in the HA hydrogel triggers invasive PCa cells to differentially express and localize receptor for hyaluronan mediated motility (RHAMM)/CD168 which, in the absence of CD44, appears to contribute to PCa motility and invasion by interacting with the HA hydrogel components. PCa cell invasion through the HA hydrogel also was found to depend on the activity of hyaluronidases. Studies shown here reveal that while hyaluronidase activity is necessary for invadopodia and inter-connecting cluster formation, activity alone is not sufficient for acquisition of invasiveness to occur. We therefore suggest that development of invasive behavior in 3D HA-based systems requires development of additional cellular features, such as activation of motility associated pathways that regulate formation of invadopodia. Thus, we report development of a 3D system amenable to dissection of biological processes associated with cancer cell motility through HA-rich connective tissues.""","""['Lisa A Gurski', 'Xian Xu', 'Lyana N Labrada', 'Ngoc T Nguyen', 'Longxi Xiao', 'Kenneth L van Golen', 'Xinqiao Jia', 'Mary C Farach-Carson']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Hyaluronic acid, CD44 and RHAMM regulate myoblast behavior during embryogenesis.', 'Oligosaccharides of hyaluronan induce angiogenesis through distinct CD44 and RHAMM-mediated signalling pathways involving Cdc2 and gamma-adducin.', 'Elevated hyaluronan and hyaluronan-mediated motility receptor are associated with biochemical failure in patients with intermediate-grade prostate tumors.', 'The roles of hyaluronan/RHAMM/CD44 and their respective interactions along the insidious pathways of fibrosarcoma progression.', 'Role of receptor for hyaluronan-mediated motility (RHAMM) in human head and neck cancers.', 'Dynamic modulation of matrix adhesiveness induces epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in prostate cancer cells in 3D.', 'Role of Hyaluronic Acid in Selected Malignant Neoplasms in Women.', 'Three-dimensional in vitro culture models in oncology research.', '3D Modeling of Epithelial Tumors-The Synergy between Materials Engineering, 3D Bioprinting, High-Content Imaging, and Nanotechnology.', 'Biomimetic stiffening of cell-laden hydrogels via sequential thiol-ene and hydrazone click reactions.']"""

When we tested this model in the context of a prostate tumor xenograft, we found that 8CPT had no significant effect on prostate tumor growth alone. However, in cells harboring cRap1, 8CPT dramatically inhibited not only prostate tumor growth but also VEGF expression and angiogenesis within the tumor microenvironment. Subsequent analysis of the mechanism revealed that, in prostate tumor epithelial cells, 8CPT acted via stimulation of PKA rather than Epac/Rap1. PKA antagonizes Rap1 and hypoxic induction of 1α protein expression, VEGF production and, ultimately, angiogenesis.

Secondary bone cancer (SBC) is a complex disease caused by metastasis of tumor cells from their primary site and is characterized by intricate interplay of molecular interactions. Identification of targets for multifactorial diseases such as SBC, the most frequent complication of breast and prostate cancers, is a challenge. Towards achieving our aim of identification of targets specific to SBC, we constructed a 'Cancer Genes Network', a representative protein interactome of cancer genes. Using graph theoretical methods, we obtained a set of key genes that are relevant for generic mechanisms of cancers and have a role in biological essentiality. We also compiled a curated dataset of 391 SBC genes from published literature which serves as a basis of ontological correlates of secondary bone cancer. Building on these results, we implement a strategy based on generic cancer genes, SBC genes and gene ontology enrichment method, to obtain a set of targets that are specific to bone metastasis. Through this study, we present an approach for probing one of the major complications in cancers, namely, metastasis. The results on genes that play generic roles in cancer phenotype, obtained by network analysis of 'Cancer Genes Network', have broader implications in understanding the role of molecular regulators in mechanisms of cancers.

Internal and external validation of the model was conducted using a validation set (also from KnowledgeNet), permutations, and external data on genes with recurrent prostate tumor mutations. We evaluated a set of 33 gene characteristics as predictors. Sixteen of the original 33 predictors were significant in the model. We found that a typical PCa gene is a prostate-specific transcription factor, kinase, or phosphatase with high interindividual variance of the expression level in adjacent normal prostate tissue and differential expression between normal prostate tissue and primary tumor. PCa genes are likely to have an antiapoptotic effect and to play a role in cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and cell adhesion. Their proteins are likely to be ubiquitinated or sumoylated but not acetylated. A number of novel PCa candidates have been proposed. Functional annotations of novel candidates identified antiapoptosis, regulation of cell proliferation, positive regulation of kinase activity, positive regulation of transferase activity, angiogenesis, positive regulation of cell division, and cell adhesion as top functions.

Four core-targeted biopsies of low ADC lesions were performed under transrectal-ultrasound guidance with reference to ADC map. The positive predictive values (PPVs) of low ADC lesions were calculated and compared for the peripheral zone (PZ), transition zone (TZ), and anterior portion, respectively.

We previously revealed that the expression of C2GnT is positively correlated with poor prognosis in prostate cancer patients. However, the detailed mechanisms underlying their poor prognosis remain unclear. In the current study, we report that the core2 O-glycans carried by the surface MUC1 glycoproteins of prostate cancer cells play an important role in the evasion of NK cell immunity. In C2GnT‑expressing prostate cancer cells, the MUC1 core2 O-glycans are modified with poly-N-acetyllactosamine. MUC1 glycoproteins carrying poly-N-acetyllactosamine attenuated the interaction of the cancer cells with NK cells, resulting in decreased secretion of granzyme B by the NK cells. Poly‑N‑acetyllactosamine also interfered with the ability of tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) to access the cancer cell surface. These effects of poly-N-acetyllactosamine on NK cells render C2GnT-expressing prostate cancer cells resistant to NK cell cytotoxicity. By contrast, C2GnT-deficient prostate cancer cells carrying a lower amount of poly-N-acetyllactosamine than the C2GnT-expressing prostate cancer cells were significantly more susceptible to NK cell cytotoxicity.

Chronic inflammation has been proposed as a candidate mechanism at the crossroad between these two clinical entities.Aim of study is to examine the correlation among pre-operatory LUTS/BPH severity, MetS features and inflammatory infiltrates in prostatectomy specimens.  Methods:   A total of 271 consecutive men treated with simple prostatectomy were retrospectively selected for this study in two tertiary referral centers for LUTS/BPH. Prostate diameters and volume were measured by transrectal ultrasound, LUTS scored by International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and obstruction by uroflowmetry. The International Diabetes Federation and American Heart Association and the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute was used to define MetS. The inflammatory infiltrate was investigated combining anatomic location, grade and extent of flogosis into the overall inflammatory score (IS); the glandular disruption (GD) was used as a further marker.  Results:   Eighty-six (31.7%) men were affected by MetS. Prostatic volume and anterior-posterior (AP) diameter were positively associated to the number of MetS components. Among MetS determinants, only dyslipidaemia (increased serum triglycerides and reduced serum high-density lipoprotein) was associated with an increased risk of having a prostatic volume >60 cm(3) (hazard ratio (HR) = 3.268, P < 0.001). A significant positive correlation between the presence of MetS and the IS was observed. MetS patients presented lower uroflowmetric parameters as compared with those without MetS (Maximum flow rate (Q(max)): 8.6 vs 10.1, P = 0.008 and average flow rate (Q(ave)): 4.6 vs 5.3, P = 0.033, respectively), and higher obstructive urinary symptoms score (P = 0.064).

In contrast, the protein is not expressed in PCas of low malignant potential. To gain insight into the mechanism regulating its expression, we tested the hypothesis that differential methylation of CpG islands within HSPB1 controls transcription and subsequent translation of the gene.  Methods:   We studied prostate epithelial cell lines and tissue biopsies, including 59 BPH and 415 PCas, of which 367 were a cohort of men with up to 20 years of follow-up. Methylation across the gene (DNA methylation (DNAme)) was assayed by pyrosequencing. Hsp-27 expression was assessed by western blot and immunohistochemistry.  Results:   In cancer tissues, methylation increased in a 3' direction (P < 0.0001) whereas in benign hyperplasia methylation was constantly below 5%, a cutoff giving a specificity of 100% and sensitivity of 50%. Although methylation of the promoter region was significantly discriminating between benign and malignant prostatic epithelia, it compared poorly with methylation of the first intron. The prognostic value of HSPB1 DNAme was confirmed by both univariate (hazard ratio 1.77 per 50% increment, P = 0.02) and multivariate models.

Growth inhibition was measured using the MTT assay. Expression of P-glycoprotein (P-GP), multidrug resistance protein-1 (MRP-1), multidrug resistance protein-2 (MRP-2), breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) and androgen receptor (AR) were examined by western blot analysis. Pygeum africanum extract clearly turned out as the main cytotoxic component of the Prostaprotect prescription mixture, and initated apoptosis in sensitive cell lines. All other extracts had only minor toxic effects. Western blot analysis revealed increased expression of P-GP in HLaC79-Clone1 cells, while HLaC79 and FADU cells were negative. All three cell lines were negative for MRP-1 and BCRP but positive for MRP-2. HLaC79 and its descendant HLaC79-Clone1 both expressed AR, as verified by western blotting and immunofluorescence staining. Primary mucosal keratinocytes were negative for all multidrug resistance markers as well as for AR. Growth inhibition rates of the single herbal extracts were compared with previously published results in prostate carcinoma cell lines.

It may decrease the hospital cost and morbidity associated with transurethral resection of the prostate. However, prostate cancer may go undetected because tissue is not taken at laser vaporization. To our knowledge the rate of clinically significant prostate cancer missed by laser vaporization has not been assessed to date. We determined the rate of clinically significant prostate cancer detected by transurethral resection of the prostate compared to the estimated number of cancers missed by laser vaporization.  Materials and methods:   A total of 74,505 men diagnosed with stage T1 prostate cancer between 2004 and 2006 were identified from the SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results) program in the United States. The total number of laser vaporizations and transurethral resections were calculated based on Medicare claims for the same period. Clinically significant cancer was defined as that with a Gleason score of 7 or greater in men 40 to 75 years old.  Results:   If prostate specific antigen screening were used uniformly (excluding men with prostate specific antigen greater than 4 ng/ml), only 1 of 382 transurethral resections of the prostate would identify clinically significant prostate cancer for a total of 390 in the American population in 3 years. Based on Medicare reported laser vaporization use a total of only 163 clinically significant cancers would be missed in more than 60,000 procedures.  Conclusions:   The incidence of T1a and T1b prostate cancer remains low and few patients have clinically significant prostate cancer. When prostate specific antigen screening is used, the number of clinically significant tumors missed by ablative procedures is low (average of 0.26% of all procedures) and can be identified by prostate specific antigen screening.""","""['Joshua J Meeks', 'Alexandra C Maschino', 'Kevin T McVary', 'Jaspreet S Sandhu']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Extensive biopsies and transurethral prostate resection in men with previous negative biopsies and high or increasing prostate specific antigen.', 'A prospective, randomized trial comparing conventional transurethral prostate resection with PlasmaKinetic vaporization of the prostate: physiological changes, early complications and long-term followup.', 'Standard versus age-specific prostate specific antigen reference ranges among men with clinically localized prostate cancer: A pathological analysis.', 'Role of transurethral biopsy sampling of the prostate to diagnose prostate cancer in men undergoing surgical intervention for benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'Significance of serum free prostate specific antigen in the screening of prostate cancer.', 'A systematic review and meta-analysis of efficacy and safety comparing greenlight laser vaporization with transurethral resection of the prostate for benign prostatic hyperplasia with prostate volume less than 80\xa0ml.', 'Photoselective Vaporization of the Prostate in the Management of Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms in Prostate Cancer Patients on Active Surveillance.', 'Favorable long-term oncological and urinary outcomes of incidental prostate cancer following holmium laser enucleation of the prostate.', 'Comparison of Patients Undergoing PVP Versus TURP for LUTS/BPH.', 'Prognostic histopathological and molecular markers on prostate cancer needle-biopsies: a review.']"""

However, there are concerns that patients are being discharged from the hospital prematurely. We examined associations between hospital stay and short-term outcomes for a low risk procedure (prostatectomy) and high risk procedure (cystectomy).  Materials and methods:   We used SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results)-Medicare data from 1992 through 2005 to identify 46,781 prostatectomy and 9,035 cystectomy cases. We assessed our main outcome (adjusted likelihood of hospital readmission within 30 days) using a logistic regression model. Secondary outcomes included mortality rates and discharge disposition.  Results:   In comparing patients from 1992 to 1993, to 2004 to 2005, hospital stay decreased approximately 3 days for both surgeries (relative decrease of more than 50% for prostatectomy and 21% for cystectomy). Hospital readmission rates were 4.5% and 25.2% for prostatectomy and cystectomy, respectively, and remained stable with time. Skilled nursing/intermediate care use was stable for patients who underwent prostatectomy (approximately 1%), but increased from 8.2% (95% CI 5.4-11.4) to 18.9% (95% CI 16.8-21.3) for those treated with cystectomy. Use of home care increased from 8.1% (95% CI 7.3-9.0) to 11.1% (95% CI 10.1-12.1) and from 34.2% (95% CI 29.7-38.7) to 47.5% (95% CI 44.5-50.1) for prostatectomy and cystectomy cases, respectively.  Conclusions:   Reductions in hospital stay were more dramatic for patients who underwent prostatectomy and were associated with stable short-term outcomes. Conversely, smaller reductions in hospitalization for patients undergoing cystectomy were met with substantial increases in the use of post-acute care.

We determined if the new guidelines were reflective of differences in survival between subepithelial prostatic stromal invasion and transmural pT4a disease.  Materials and methods:   A retrospective, multi-institutional cohort of cystectomy cases with subepithelial prostatic stromal invasion from the University of Chicago and Cleveland Clinic were compared to a cohort with transmural pT4a disease. All pathological specimens were rereviewed at the respective institutions. Patients were excluded from the final cohort if variant bladder cancer histology, pT3 bladder disease or extraprostatic extension of urothelial carcinoma were identified. The primary end points were cancer specific and overall survival.  Results:   Our study sample consisted of 48 patients with subepithelial prostatic stromal invasion and 49 patients with transmural pT4a disease. Median followup was 12.8 months (IQR 4.9 to 31.4). Patients with subepithelial prostatic stromal invasion had lower rates of lymph node involvement than those with transmural pT4a disease (14.6% vs 61.2%, p <0.001) and lower rates of positive surgical margins (18.7% vs 61.2%, p <0.001). Rates of perioperative chemotherapy were similar in both groups. When comparing subepithelial prostatic stromal invasion and transmural pT4a groups, overall survival was 64.0 vs 9.8 months and median cancer specific survival was not achieved vs 16.5 months, respectively (p <0.001).

We studied the relationship between certificate of need laws and market level adoption of robotic prostatectomy.  Materials and methods:   We used SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results)-Medicare data from 2003 through 2007 to identify men 66 years old or older treated with prostatectomy for prostate cancer. Using data from the American Health Planning Association, we categorized Health Service Areas according to the stringency of certificate of need regulations (ie low vs high stringency) presiding over that market. We assessed our outcomes (probability of adopting robotic prostatectomy and propensity for robotic prostatectomy use in adopting Health Service Areas) using Cox proportional hazards and Poisson regression models, respectively.  Results:   Compared to low stringency markets, high stringency markets were more racially diverse (54% vs 15% nonwhite, p <0.01), and had similar population densities (886 vs 861 people per square mile, p = 0.97) and median incomes ($42,344 vs $39,770, p = 0.56). In general, both market types had an increase in the adoption and utilization of robotic prostatectomy. However, the probability of robotic prostatectomy adoption (p = 0.22) did not differ based on a market's certificate of need stringency and use was lower in high stringency markets (p <0.01).

Results:   Median prostate specific antigen was 0.61 ng/ml. [(11)C]choline positron emission tomography/computerized tomography was positive in 16 of 75 patients (21%).

Materials and methods:   A mean of 32 paraffin blocks was processed from prostate surgical specimens step sectioned at 3 to 5 mm intervals from 300 patients treated with radical retropubic prostatectomy. Each transverse section was subdivided into 2 anterolateral and 2 posterolateral quadrants. Tumor extent was evaluated by a semiquantitative point count method. Dominant nodule extent was recorded as the maximal number of positive points of the largest single focus of cancer in the quadrants. Time to biochemical recurrence was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier product limit analysis. Prediction of shorter time to biochemical recurrence was determined by univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models.  Results:   Except for age and race, total and index tumor extent was significantly associated with higher preoperative prostate specific antigen, clinical stage T2, pathological stage greater than T2, positive surgical margins and higher radical prostatectomy Gleason score.

We evaluated the time course of grade 2-4 genitourinary toxicities in men treated with primary radiation or observation for T1-T2 prostate cancer.  Materials and methods:   We performed a population based cohort study using Medicare claims data linked to SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results) data. Cumulative incidence functions for time to first genitourinary event were calculated based on the competing risks model with death before any genitourinary event as a competing event. The generalized estimating equation method was used to evaluate the risk ratios of recurrent events.  Results:   Of the study patients 60,134 received radiation therapy and 25,904 underwent observation. The adjusted risk ratio for genitourinary toxicity was 2.49 (95% CI 2.00-3.11) for 10 years and thereafter. Patients who had required prior procedures for obstruction/stricture, including transurethral prostate resection, before radiation therapy were at significantly increased risk for genitourinary toxicity (risk ratio 2.78, 95% CI 2.56-2.94).  Conclusions:   This study demonstrates that the increased risk of grade 2-4 genitourinary toxicities attributable to radiation therapy persists 10 years after treatment and thereafter. Patients who required prior procedures for obstruction/stricture were at higher risk for genitourinary toxicity than those without these preexisting conditions.""","""['Sung Kim', 'Dirk F Moore', 'Weichung Shih', 'Yong Lin', 'Hui Li', 'Yu-Hsuan Shao', 'Shunhua Shen', 'Grace L Lu-Yao']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Hypofractionated versus conventionally fractionated radiotherapy for patients with prostate cancer (HYPRO): acute toxicity results from a randomised non-inferiority phase 3 trial.', 'Prospective Phase II Trial of Once-weekly Hypofractionated Radiation Therapy for Low-risk Adenocarcinoma of the Prostate: Late Toxicities and Outcomes.', 'Stereotactic body radiation therapy for Japanese patients with localized prostate cancer: 2-year results and predictive factors for acute genitourinary toxicities.', 'Is there an increase in genitourinary toxicity in patients treated with transurethral resection of the prostate and radiotherapy?

Bone destruction in the acetabulum caused by metastatic tumors will cause hip pain and joint dysfunction. It results in decreased quality of life for patients. The aim of our study was to explore the clinical effect of metastatic periacetabular tumors treated with percutaneous cementoplasty and interstitial implantation of (125)I seeds.  Methods:   A retrospective analysis was performed on 24 patients with metastatic periacetabular tumors who underwent combined therapy of percutaneous acetabuloplasty and interstitial implantation of (125)I seeds between February 2003 and June 2011. There were 13 males and 11 females aged 19-80 years with a mean age of 57.3. The primary tumor site was the lung in eight cases, the breast in six, the prostate cancer in eight, and the liver in two. The amount of implanted (125)I seeds was 12-20 seeds/person, with a mean of 16.5 seeds/person, and the matching peripheral dosage (MPD) was 80~100Gy. Routine postoperative chemotherapy and other combined treatments were applied to patients after the surgical operation. Changes in the Karnofsky Score(KPS), Harris Hip Score(Harris), and Visual Analog Scale(VAS) were observed during the follow-up period.  Results:   The 24 patients' operations were all successful. No major complications occurred. Complete pain relief was achieved in 58% (14 of 24) of patients, and pain reduction was achieved in the 42% remaining (10) patients. The mean duration of pain relief was 8.3 months. Pain recurred in one patient 3 months after surgery. Six patients had died and 18 patients were alive at the time of the 1-year follow-up. Comparing the KPS, Harris and VAS scores pre- and postoperativelyat 1, 6, and 12 months, the combined therapy method was significantly effective in metastatic periacetabular tumor patients (P<0.05).

We present the first study to compare QOL after SBRT and radical prostatectomy, with QOL assessed at approximately the same times pre- and post-treatment and using the same validated QOL instrument.  Methods:   Patients with clinically localized prostate cancer were treated with either radical prostatectomy (n = 123 Spanish patients) or SBRT (n = 216 American patients). QOL was assessed using the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) grouped into urinary, sexual, and bowel domains. For comparison purposes, SBRT EPIC data at baseline, 3 weeks, 5, 11, 24, and 36 months were compared to surgery data at baseline, 1, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months. Differences in patient characteristics between the two groups were assessed using Chi-squared tests for categorical variables and t-tests for continuous variables. Generalized estimating equation (GEE) models were constructed for each EPIC scale to account for correlation among repeated measures and used to assess the effect of treatment on QOL.  Results:   The largest differences in QOL occurred in the first 1-6 months after treatment, with larger declines following surgery in urinary and sexual QOL as compared to SBRT, and a larger decline in bowel QOL following SBRT as compared to surgery. Long-term urinary and sexual QOL declines remained clinically significantly lower for surgery patients but not for SBRT patients.  Conclusions:   Overall, these results may have implications for patient and physician clinical decision making which are often influenced by QOL. These differences in sexual, urinary and bowel QOL should be closely considered in selecting the right treatment, especially in evaluating the value of non-invasive treatments, such as SBRT.""","""['Alan Katz', 'Montserrat Ferrer', 'José Francisco Suárez;Multicentric Spanish Group of Clinically Localized Prostate Cancer']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Radiat Oncol""","""['Patient-reported Quality of Life After SBRT, LDR, and HDR Brachytherapy for Prostate Cancer: A Comparison of Outcomes.', 'Patient-reported outcomes following stereotactic body radiation therapy for clinically localized prostate cancer.', 'Patient-reported quality of life after stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT), intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), and brachytherapy.', 'Quality of life after radiotherapy for prostate cancer.', 'A systematic review of expanded prostate cancer index composite (EPIC) quality of life after surgery or radiation treatment.', 'Liposomes in Cancer Therapy: How Did We Start and Where Are We Now.', 'Stereotactic Magnetic Resonance-Guided Adaptive and Non-Adaptive Radiotherapy on Combination MR-Linear Accelerators: Current Practice and Future Directions.', 'Isolation and identification of cancer stem cells from PC3 human prostate carcinoma cell line.', 'Comparisons of health-related quality of life among surgery and radiotherapy for localized prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Propensity score matched comparison of SBRT versus IMRT for the treatment of localized prostate cancer.']"""

Objective:   To determine whether long-term multivitamin supplementation decreases the risk of total and site-specific cancer events among men.  Design, setting, and participants:   A large-scale, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trial (Physicians"" Health Study II) of 14 641 male US physicians initially aged 50 years or older (mean [SD] age, 64.3 [9.2] years), including 1312 men with a history of cancer at randomization, enrolled in a common multivitamin study that began in 1997 with treatment and follow-up through June 1, 2011.  Intervention:   Daily multivitamin or placebo.  Main outcome measures:   Total cancer (excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer), with prostate, colorectal, and other site-specific cancers among the secondary end points.  Results:   During a median (interquartile range) follow-up of 11.2 (10.7-13.3) years, there were 2669 men with confirmed cancer, including 1373 cases of prostate cancer and 210 cases of colorectal cancer. Compared with placebo, men taking a daily multivitamin had a statistically significant reduction in the incidence of total cancer (multivitamin and placebo groups, 17.0 and 18.3 events, respectively, per 1000 person-years; hazard ratio [HR], 0.92; 95% CI, 0.86-0.998; P=.04). There was no significant effect of a daily multivitamin on prostate cancer (multivitamin and placebo groups, 9.1 and 9.2 events, respectively, per 1000 person-years; HR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.88-1.09; P=.76), colorectal cancer (multivitamin and placebo groups, 1.2 and 1.4 events, respectively, per 1000 person-years; HR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.68-1.17; P=.39), or other site-specific cancers.

We compared pudendal nerve block (NPB) and combined spinal-epidural anesthesia (CSE) in order to perform a pain-free high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy in a former pilot study in 2010. Regarding this background, in the present study, we only performed the bilateral perineal infiltration of the pudendal nerve.  Methods:   In 25 patients (71.8 ± 4.18 years) suffering from a high-risk prostate carcinoma, we performed the HDR-brachytherapy with the NPB. The perioperative compatibility, the subjective feeling (German school marks principle 1-6), subjective pain (VAS 1-10) and the early postoperative course (mobility, complications) were examined.  Results:   All patients preferred the NPB. There was no change of anesthesia form necessary. The expense time of NPB was 10.68 ± 2.34 min. The hollow needles (mean 24, range 13-27) for the HDR-brachytherapy remained on average 79.92 ± 12.41 min. During and postoperative, pain feeling was between 1.4 ± 1.08 and 1.08 ± 1.00. A transurethral 22 French Foley catheter was left in place for 6 h. All patients felt the bladder catheter as annoying, but they considered postoperative mobility as more important as complete lack of pain. The subjective feeling was described as 2.28 ± 0.74. Any side effects or complications did not appear.  Conclusions:   Bilateral NPB is a safe and effective analgesic option in HDR-brachytherapy and can replace CSE. It offers the advantage of almost no impaired mobility of the patient and can be performed by the urologist himself.

The growth inhibition of PC-3 cells was associated with sub-G(1) and G(0)/G(1) accumulation, confirmed by the down-regulation of CDK2, CDK4, cyclin D1 and cyclin E, which are correlated with G(1) phase of cell cycle. Pipernonaline up-regulated cleavage of procaspase-3/PARP, but did not change expression of proapoptotic bax and antiapoptotic bcl-2 proteins. Its caspase-3 activation was confirmed by the caspase-3 assay kit. In addition, pipernonaline caused the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), increase of intracellular Ca(2+), and mitochondrial membrane depolarization, which these phenomena were reversed by N-acetylcysteine, a ROS scavenger. The results suggest that pipernonaline exhibits apoptotic properties through ROS production, which causes disruption of mitochondrial function and Ca(2+) homeostasis and leads to its downstream events including activation of caspase-3 and cleavage of PARP in PC-3 cells.

The pro-survival function of AR is mediated mainly by transcriptional regulation of its target genes. By contrast, the pro-death function of AR can be transcription-dependent or -independent, although the underlying mechanism of the latter is incompletely understood. Here we report that, in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells, AR promotes UV-induced apoptosis through down-regulation of basal expression of p21 independently of its transcriptional activity. Down-regulation of basal p21 expression depends on AR N-terminal interacting protein PIRH2, an E3 ligase for proteasomal degradation of p53. Silencing of PIRH2 up-regulates p53, which in turn activates p21 transcription. Consistent with this, knockdown of PIRH2 suppresses UV-induced AR-dependent apoptosis.

Materials and methods:   Methylation was assessed using quantitative Pyrosequencing® in a training set consisting of 65 nontumor and tumor associated prostate tissues from University of Wisconsin. A multiplex model was generated using multivariate logistic regression and externally validated in blinded fashion in a set of 47 nontumor and tumor associated biopsy specimens from University of Washington.  Results:   We observed robust methylation differences in all genes at all CpGs assayed (p <0.0001). Regression models incorporating individual genes (EVX1, CAV1 and FGF1) and a gene combination (EVX1 and FGF1) discriminated nontumor from tumor associated tissues in the original training set (AUC 0.796-0.898, p <0.001). On external validation uniplex models incorporating EVX1, CAV1 or FGF1 discriminated tumor from nontumor associated biopsy negative specimens (AUC 0.702, 0.696 and 0.658, respectively, p <0.05). A multiplex model (EVX1 and FGF1) identified patients with prostate cancer (AUC 0.774, p = 0.001) and had a negative predictive value of 0.909. Comparison between 2 separate cores in patients in this validation set revealed similar methylation defects, indicating detection of a widespread field defect.  Conclusions:   A widespread epigenetic field defect can be used to detect prostate cancer in patients with histologically negative biopsies.

In contrast, recent genome-wide association studies identified single nucleotide polymorphisms that increase prostate cancer risk. Some of these single nucleotide polymorphisms may also predispose to surgical intervention for benign prostatic hyperplasia. We determined whether these single nucleotide polymorphisms are also associated with lower urinary tract symptom severity and benign prostatic hyperplasia medication use.  Materials and methods:   The genotypes of 38 single nucleotide polymorphisms previously associated with prostate cancer risk were determined for 1,168 healthy white male volunteers.

Statistical analyses were done to compare the frequency of the single nucleotide polymorphisms with American Urological Association symptom index and benign prostatic hyperplasia medication use.  Results:   Several single nucleotide polymorphisms, including rs2736098 on chromosome 5p15, showed a significant relationship with benign prostatic hyperplasia medication.

Active surveillance (AS) is of growing interest as an alternative to radical treatment of low-risk PCa.  Objective:   To update our experience in the largest worldwide prospective AS cohort.  Design, setting, and participants:   Eligible patients had clinical stage T1/T2 PCa, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) ≤ 10 ng/ml, PSA density <0.2 ng/ml per milliliter, one or two positive biopsy cores, and Gleason score ≤ 6. PSA was measured every 3-6 mo, and volume-based repeat biopsies were scheduled after 1, 4, and 7 yr. Reclassification was defined as more than two positive cores or Gleason >6 at repeat biopsy. Recommendation for treatment was triggered in case of PSA doubling time <3 yr or reclassification.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Multivariate regression analysis was used to evaluate predictors for reclassification at repeat biopsy. Active therapy-free survival (ATFS) was assessed with a Kaplan-Meier analysis, and Cox regression was used to evaluate the association of clinical characteristics with active therapy over time.  Results and limitations:   In total, 2494 patients were included and followed for a median of 1.6 yr. One or more repeat biopsies were performed in 1480 men, of whom 415 men (28%) showed reclassification. Compliance with the first repeat biopsy was estimated to be 81%. During follow-up, 527 patients (21.1%) underwent active therapy. ATFS at 2 yr was 77.3%. The strongest predictors for reclassification and switching to deferred treatment were the number of positive cores (two cores compared with one core) and PSA density. The disease-specific survival rate was 100%. Follow-up was too short to draw definitive conclusions about the safety of AS.  Conclusions:   Our short-term data support AS as a feasible strategy to reduce overtreatment. Clinical characteristics and PSA kinetics during follow-up can be used for risk stratification.

However, the independent prognostic value of this variable remains open to debate. In this study we evaluated the association of clinical stage with death from prostate cancer in men who underwent radical prostatectomy and assessed for changes in its prognostic value over time.  Materials and methods:   We reviewed the records of 14,842 consecutive patients who underwent radical prostatectomy at our institution between 1970 and 2008 without having received preoperative hormone or radiation therapy. Postoperative disease recurrence was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the log rank test. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to analyze the association of clinical stage with outcome.  Results:   A total of 5,725 (38.6%) men were classified as having cT1 tumors, 8,160 (55.0%) cT2 tumors and 957 (6.4%) cT3 disease. On univariate analysis clinical stage was significantly associated with postoperative biochemical recurrence, systemic progression and death from prostate cancer (p <0.001 for each). Moreover on multivariate analysis clinical stage was significantly associated with death from cancer for patients treated before (1.45, p = 0.006) and those treated during (1.96, p <0.001) the prostate specific antigen era. Furthermore, the incorporation of clinical stage into contemporary risk stratification improved the prediction of cancer specific survival (c statistic 0.782 without and 0.802 with clinical stage).  Conclusions:   Clinical stage is significantly associated with systemic progression and death from prostate cancer.

However, most previous studies were performed on specimens following salvage cryotherapy, which introduces additional confounding variables of the histologic changes after the other primary treatment modalities. We examined prostate needle core biopsies from a cohort of patients following cryotherapy as monotherapy for prostatic adenocarcinoma, to evaluate the true spectrum of morphologic changes in the prostate. Cases that had prior radiation therapy or androgen-deprivation therapy were excluded from the study. Thirty cases were identified. The average patient age was 69 years (range, 51-81 years), and the average time interval between cryotherapy and repeat biopsy was 19.2 months (range, 2-60 months). The original Gleason scores were as follows: 3 + 3 = 6 in 14 (46%) of 30 cases, 3 + 4 = 7 in 8 (27%) of 30 cases, 4 + 3 = 7 in 2 (7%) of 30 cases, 4 + 4 = 8 in 3 (10%) of 30 cases, 4 + 5 = 9 in 2 (7%) of 30 cases, and 5 + 4 = 9 in 1 (3%) of 30 cases. Postcryotherapy, 11 of 30 cases (37%) had recurrent/residual prostatic adenocarcinoma, which showed no therapy-related changes, similar to the residual benign glands. Gleason scores were higher in 5 (46%) of 11 cases, same in 4 (36%) of 11 cases, and lower in 2 (18%) of 11 cases. Multiple additional histologic findings were documented. Unlike other nonsurgical therapeutic modalities, cases with recurrent/residual prostatic adenocarcinoma and benign glands showed therapy-related changes predominantly involving the stroma.

The aim of this study is to assess the feasibility and the efficacy of RRP-WR as a surgical intervention for locally confined prostate cancer.  Methods:   A total of 90 Japanese patients with pathologically proven and clinically locally confined hormone-naïve prostate cancer were treated through RRP-WR, and the surgical morbidity was assessed. The patients were observed without immediate treatment until biochemical recurrence (BCR).  Results:   The surgical morbidities were comparable to conventional procedures. No positive surgical margin (pSM) was pathologically identified in pT2 cases from prostatectomy specimens. It was identified in only 14.3% of pT3a cases, 36.4% of pT3b cases and 100% of pT4 cases. No apical pSM was found except for one of the pT4 cases in the levator ani muscle. PSA was at an undetectable level in 80.0% of all cases, 90.0% of pT2 cases, and 67.5% of pT3 and pT4 cases after surgery. The BCR-free survival rate in all cases was 82.4% and that of high-risk cases without pSM was 76.9% at a median follow-up of 19.3 months (3.3 to 59.2).

The aim of this study is to investigate the expression of RBM5 in human prostate cancer and its mechanism of tumor suppression.  Methods:   The expression of RBM5 protein in cancerous prostatic tissues and normal tissues was examined by IHC. PC-3 cell line was used to determine the apoptotic function of RBM5 in vitro. PC-3 cells were transiently transfected with pcDNA3.1-RBM5. Cell viability was determined by MTT assay. Rhodamine 123 staining and Annexin V analysis were performed to observe the apoptotic activity of PC-3 cells overexpressing RBM5. Expression of apoptosis-related genes was assessed by western blot.  Results:   The expression of RBM5 protein was significantly decreased in cancerous prostatic tissues compared to the normal tissues. PC-3 cells overexpressing RBM5 showed not only significant growth inhibition compared with the vector controls, but also dysfunction of mitochondrial membrane potential and increased apoptotic activity. To further define RBM5 function in apoptotic pathways, we investigated differential expression profiles of various BH3-only proteins including Bid, Bad, and Bim, and apoptosis regulatory proteins include P53, cleaved caspase9, and cleaved caspase3. We found that the expression of both BH3-only proteins and apoptosis regulatory proteins was increased in RBM5 transfected cells.  Conclusion:   The expression of RBM5 protein was significantly decreased in cancerous prostatic tissues, which suggests that RBM5 plays an important role in the pathogenesis of prostate cancer. RBM5 may induce the apoptosis of prostate cancer PC-3 cells by modulating the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, and thus RBM5 might be a promising target for gene therapy on prostate cancer.""","""['Lijing Zhao', 'Ranwei Li', 'Chen Shao', 'Ping Li', 'Jian Liu', 'Ke Wang']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""World J Surg Oncol""","""['The tumor suppressor gene RBM5 inhibits lung adenocarcinoma cell growth and induces apoptosis.', '3p21.3 tumor suppressor gene H37/Luca15/RBM5 inhibits growth of human lung cancer cells through cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.', 'Tumor suppressor gene RBM5 delivered by attenuated Salmonella inhibits lung adenocarcinoma through diverse apoptotic signaling pathways.', 'RBM5 as a putative tumor suppressor gene for lung cancer.', 'Regulating RNA Binding Motif 5 Gene Expression- A Novel Therapeutic Target for Lung Cancer.', 'Structural basis for specific RNA recognition by the alternative splicing factor RBM5.', 'The RNA-Binding Motif Protein Family in Cancer: Friend or Foe?', 'Construction of an RNA-Binding Protein-Related Prognostic Model for Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma Based on TCGA and GTEx Databases.', 'RNA Binding Motif 5 (RBM5) in the CNS-Moving Beyond Cancer to Harness RNA Splicing to Mitigate the Consequences of Brain Injury.', 'Hallmarks of Splicing Defects in Cancer: Clinical Applications in the Era of Personalized Medicine.']"""

We evaluated prostate cancer detection rates in 171 consecutive men using magnetic resonance ultrasound fusion prostate biopsy.  Materials and methods:   Subjects underwent targeted biopsy for active surveillance (106) or persistently increased prostate specific antigen but negative prior conventional biopsy (65). Before biopsy, each man underwent multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging at 3.0 Tesla. Lesions on magnetic resonance imaging were outlined in 3 dimensions and assigned increasing cancer suspicion levels (image grade 1 to 5) by a uroradiologist. A biopsy tracking system was used to fuse the stored magnetic resonance imaging with real-time ultrasound, generating a 3-dimensional prostate model on the fly. Working from the 3-dimensional model, transrectal biopsy of target lesions and 12 systematic biopsies were performed with the patient under local anesthesia in the clinic.  Results:   A total of 171 subjects (median age 65 years) underwent targeted biopsy. At biopsy, median prostate specific antigen was 4.9 ng/ml and prostate volume was 48 cc. A targeted biopsy was 3 times more likely to identify cancer than a systematic biopsy (21% vs 7%). Prostate cancer was found in 53% of men, 38% of whom had Gleason grade 7 or greater cancer. Of the men with Gleason 7 or greater cancer 38% had disease detected only on targeted biopsies. Targeted biopsy findings correlated with level of suspicion on magnetic resonance imaging. Of 16 men 15 (94%) with an image grade 5 target (highest suspicion) had prostate cancer, including 7 with Gleason 7 or greater cancer.

An essential constraint was to achieve this within a busy centre without reducing patient throughput, which had been reported with other techniques.  Methods:   45 patients had 3 fiducial markers inserted into the prostate and were imaged daily using kilovoltage orthogonal images with online correction applied before treatment. A total of 1612 image pairs were acquired and analysed to identify interfractional motion, seed migration and interobserver variability, and assess ease of use.  Results:   This method of IGRT was implemented successfully in our centre with no impact on treatment times and patient throughput. Systematic (Σ) interfractional set-up errors were 2.2, 2.7 and 3.9 mm in right-left (RL), superoinferior (SI) and anteroposterior (AP) directions, respectively. Random (σ) interfractional set-up errors were 3.2 (RL), 3.7 (SI) and 5.7 mm (AP). There were significant differences between patients. Seed migration and interobserver variability were not significant issues.  Conclusions:   The described technique is facilitated by the advanced imaging system, allowing a fast and effective method of correcting set-up errors before treatment. Extended implementation of this technique has improved treatment delivery to the majority of our prostate radiotherapy patients. The measurement of interfractional motion in this study is potentially valuable for margin reduction in intensity-modulated radiotherapy/volumetric arc therapy.

Methods:   20 prostate patients received a CT, diagnostic MRI and an MRI scan in the radiotherapy position. The quality of registration between CT and MRI was compared between the two MRI set-ups. The prostate and seminal vesicles were contoured using all scans and intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) plans were generated. Changes in the target volume and IMRT plans were investigated. Two-tailed paired Student's t-tests determined the statistical significance.  Results:   There was a decrease in the mean distance from the centre of the bony anatomy between CT and MRI (from 3.9 to 1.9 mm, p-value<0.0001) when the MRI scan was acquired in the radiotherapy position. Assuming that registering CT with an MRI scan in the radiotherapy position is the gold standard for delineating the prostate and seminal vesicles, using a planning target volume delineated on the CT with a diagnostic MRI scan viewed separately, resulted in a mean conformation number of 0.80 instead of the expected 0.98 (p<0.0001).  Conclusion:   By registering CT with an MRI scan in the radiotherapy position, there is a statistically significant improvement in the registration and IMRT quality.  Advances in knowledge:   To achieve an acceptable registration and IMRT quality in prostatic radiotherapy, neither CT with a separate diagnostic MRI nor CT registered to a diagnostic MRI will suffice.

FILIP1L is a growth inhibitory gene with multiple isoforms whose expression is increased in senescent prostate and prostate cancer cells, and decreased in many cancers. We investigated whether DNA methylation regulates FILIP1L in senescence and in prostate cancer development.  Materials and methods:   FILIP1L mRNA expression was assessed in prostate cancer and associated normal prostate tissues using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. A tissue microarray was constructed using 95 prostate cancer specimens and 45 benign prostate specimens. Vectra™ imaging was used to quantitate nuclear and cytoplasmic FILIP1L protein expression. Bisulfite sequencing and Pyrosequencing® were used to assess methylation. Prostate cancer cell lines were treated with 2'-deoxy-5-azacytidine and mRNA expression was assessed.  Results:   FILIP1L isoform 2 mRNA was increased in replicatively senescent human prostate epithelial cells and decreased in prostate cancer specimens. We verified a reduction in nuclear FILIP1L protein in prostate cancer using tissue microarrays (p = 0.006). A CpG island 5' of the isoform 2 translational start site was identified that showed hypermethylation in prostate cancer cell lines and tumors compared to normal prostate cells and tissues. Pyrosequencing confirmed FILIP1L hypermethylation in all 14 tumors compared to paired normal tissues (p <0.0001). Isoform 2 expression was induced in prostate cancer cell lines using 2'-deoxy-5-azacytidine.  Conclusions:   FILIP1L isoform 2 is one of the most commonly hypermethylated genes in prostate cancer. It may serve as an important marker of prostate cancer. Isoform 2 expression is associated with senescence and its down-regulation may represent an early important biological event in prostate cancer development.""","""['Joshua Desotelle', 'Matthew Truong', 'Jonathan Ewald', 'Pushpa Weeratunga', 'Bing Yang', 'Wei Huang', 'David Jarrard']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Prostate cancer epigenomics.', 'Downregulation of Filamin A interacting protein 1-like is associated with promoter methylation and induces an invasive phenotype in ovarian cancer.', 'Hypermethylation of CpG islands in primary and metastatic human prostate cancer.', 'Analysis of promoter non-CG methylation in prostate cancer.', 'GSTP1 CpG island hypermethylation as a molecular biomarker for prostate cancer.', 'GSTP1 CpG island hypermethylation as a molecular marker of prostate cancer.', 'Smoking-associated Downregulation of FILIP1L Enhances Lung Adenocarcinoma Progression Through Mucin Production, Inflammation, and Fibrosis.', 'Hookah Smoke Mediates Cancer-Associated Epigenomic and Transcriptomic Signatures in Human Respiratory Epithelial Cells.', 'Promoter Methylation of PRKCB, ADAMTS12, and NAALAD2 Is Specific to Prostate Cancer and Predicts Biochemical Disease Recurrence.', 'The Impact of Whole Genome Data on Therapeutic Decision-Making in Metastatic Prostate Cancer: A Retrospective Analysis.', 'Identification of Crucial Candidate Genes and Pathways in Glioblastoma Multiform by Bioinformatics Analysis.']"""

The implementation of a 'live-planning' technique at the Royal Adelaide Hospital (RAH) in 2007 enabled the completion of the whole procedure (i.e. scanning, planning and implant) in one sitting. 'Live-planning' has the advantage of a more reliable delivery of the planned treatment compared to the 'traditional pre-plan' technique (where patient is scanned and planned in the weeks prior to implant). During live planning, the actual implanted needle positions are updated real-time on the treatment planning system and the dosimetry is automatically recalculated. The aim of this investigation was to assess the differences and clinical relevance between the planned dosimetry and the updated real-time implant dosimetry.  Methods:   A number of 162 patients were included in this dosimetric study. A paired t-test was performed on the D90, V100, V150 and V200 target parameters and the differences between the planned and implanted dose distributions were analysed. Similarly, dosimetric differences for the organs at risk (OAR) were also evaluated.  Results:   Small differences between the primary dosimetric parameters for the target were found. Still, the incidence of hotspots was increased with approximately 20% for V200. Statistically significant increases were observed in the doses delivered to the OAR between the planned and implanted data; however, these increases were consistently below 3% thus probably without clinical consequences.  Conclusions:   The current study assessed the accuracy of prostate implants with I-125 seeds when compared to initial plans. The results confirmed the precision of the implant technique which RAH has in place. Nevertheless, geographical misses, anatomical restrictions and needle displacements during implant can have repercussions for centres without live-planning option if dosimetric changes are not taken into consideration.""","""['Joshua Moorrees', 'John M Lawson', 'Loredana G Marcu']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Radiat Oncol""","""['Treatment technique evolution and dosimetry trends over seven years of low dose rate prostate brachytherapy at an Australian institution.', 'Is intraoperative nomogram-based overplanning of prostate implants necessary?', 'Dosimetric comparison between treatment plans of patients treated with low-dose-rate vs. high-dose-rate interstitial prostate brachytherapy as monotherapy: Initial findings of a randomized clinical trial.', 'Which patients benefit from post-implant CT dosimetry after real-time intraoperative planning for low dose rate prostate brachytherapy?

A specifically useful marker is the risk predicted by a survival regression model. This article extends the existing methodology for applications where the length of the follow-up period depends on the predictor variables. A class of inverse probability of censoring weighted estimators is discussed in which the estimates rely on a working model for the conditional censoring distribution. The estimators are consistent for a truncated concordance index if the working model is correctly specified and if the probability of being uncensored at the truncation time is positive. In this framework, all kinds of prediction models can be assessed, and time trends in the discrimination ability of a model can be captured by varying the truncation time point.

In this study, we demonstrate that BITC not only induces apoptosis but also induces autophagy in human hormone-sensitive (Rv1) and -refractory (PC3) prostate cancer cells. In BITC-treated cells, the induction of autophagy was detected by monitoring the processing of an autophagy marker protein, microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3), the aggregation of LC3 into granular structures and the formation of acidic organelles. Inhibition of autophagy using 3-methyladenine increased BITC-induced apoptosis, whereas the administration of caspase inhibitor suppressed BITC-induced cell death. Our data also showed that BITC inhibits mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase activity in a dose-dependent manner. The expression of phospho-mTOR (Ser2481), an indicator of mTOR intrinsic catalytic activity, and phospho-UNC-51-like kinase 1 (Ser757), a direct substrate of mTOR, were decreased in BITC-treated cells. However, the increased expression of phospho-mTOR (Ser2448), phospho-AKT (Ser473) and antiapoptotic Bcl-2 were detected only in PC3 cells at later stages of BITC treatment. Collectively, our results show that BITC induces a protective autophagy response in Rv1 and PC3 cells through inhibition of the mTOR signaling pathway. Activation of the AKT survival pathway was only observed in PC3 cells, representing a resistance mechanism of advanced prostate cancer upon BITC treatment.

MAGE-A11 mediated synergistic AR transcriptional activity in LAPC-4 prostate cancer cells. The ability of MAGE-A11 to rescue transcriptional activity of complementary inactive AR mutants and promote coimmunoprecipitation between unlike forms of AR suggests that MAGE-A11 links transcriptionally active AR dimers. A model for the AR·MAGE-A11 multidimeric complex is proposed in which one AR FXXLF motif of the AR dimer engages in the androgen-dependent AR NH(2)- and carboxyl-terminal interaction, whereas the second FXXLF motif region of the AR dimer interacts with dimeric MAGE-A11. The AR·MAGE-A11 multidimeric complex accounts for the dual functions of the AR FXXLF motif in the androgen-dependent AR NH(2)- and carboxyl-terminal interaction and binding MAGE-A11 and for synergy between reported AR splice variants and full-length AR. We conclude that the increased expression of MAGE-A11 in castration-recurrent prostate cancer, which is enhanced by cyclic AMP signaling, increases AR-dependent growth of prostate cancer by MAGE-A11 forming a molecular bridge between transcriptionally active AR dimers.""","""['John T Minges', 'Shifeng Su', 'Gail Grossman', 'Amanda J Blackwelder', 'Elena A Pop', 'James L Mohler', 'Elizabeth M Wilson']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Biol Chem""","""['Gain in transcriptional activity by primate-specific coevolution of melanoma antigen-A11 and its interaction site in androgen receptor.', 'Proto-oncogene activity of melanoma antigen-A11 (MAGE-A11) regulates retinoblastoma-related p107 and E2F1 proteins.', 'Up-Regulation of Follistatin-Like 1 By the Androgen Receptor and Melanoma Antigen-A11 in Prostate Cancer.', 'Structural features discriminate androgen receptor N/C terminal and coactivator interactions.', 'Functional analysis of androgen receptor N-terminal and ligand binding domain interacting coregulators in prostate cancer.', 'Identification of ELK1 interacting peptide segments in the androgen receptor.', 'Co-expression of cancer-testis antigens of MAGE-A6 and MAGE-A11 is associated with tumor aggressiveness in patients with bladder cancer.', 'Chromosome X aneusomy and androgen receptor gene copy number aberrations in apocrine carcinoma of the breast.', 'Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte elicited therapeutic vaccine candidate targeting cancer against MAGE-A11 carcinogenic protein.', 'Methylation Profile of X-Chromosome-Related Genes in Male Breast Cancer.']"""

We developed an abbreviated photovoice project to serve as a supplement to a National Cancer Institute-funded pilot study focusing on prostate cancer (PrCA) that was set in a faith-based African American community in South Carolina. We used photovoice for three reasons: (a) to enhance communication between study participants and researchers, (b) to empower African American men and women to examine their health decisions through photographs, and (c) to better understand how participants from this community make health-related decisions. The 15 individuals participating in the photovoice project were asked to photograph aspects of their community that informed their health-related decisions. Participants provided written and oral narratives to describe the images in a small sample of photographs. Four primary themes emerged in participants' photographs and narratives: (a) food choices, (b) physical activity practices, (c) community environment and access to care, and (d) influences of spirituality and nature on health. Although written and audio-recorded narratives were similar in content, the audio-recorded responses were more descriptive and emotional. Results suggest that incorporating audio-recorded narratives in community photovoice presentations may have a greater impact than written narratives on health promotion, decision making, and policy makers because of an increased level of detail and personalization.

Several genomic alterations have been identified in PCa which may serve as predictors of progression. PTEN, (10q23.3), is a negative regulator of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PIK3)/AKT survival pathway and a tumor suppressor frequently deleted in PCa. The androgen receptor (AR) signalling pathway is known to play an important role in PCa and its blockade constitutes a commonly used treatment modality. In this study, we assessed the deletion status of PTEN along with AR expression levels in 43 primary PCa specimens with clinical follow-up.  Methods:   Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) was done on formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) PCa samples to examine the deletion status of PTEN. AR expression levels were determined using immunohistochemistry (IHC).  Results:   Using FISH, we found 18 cases of PTEN deletion. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed an association with disease recurrence (P=0.03). Concurrently, IHC staining for AR found significantly lower levels of AR expression within those tumors deleted for PTEN (P<0.05). To validate these observations we interrogated a copy number alteration and gene expression profiling dataset of 64 PCa samples, 17 of which were PTEN deleted. We confirmed the predictive value of PTEN deletion in disease recurrence (P=0.03). PTEN deletion was also linked to diminished expression of PTEN (P<0.01) and AR (P=0.02). Furthermore, gene set enrichment analysis revealed a diminished expression of genes downstream of AR signalling in PTEN deleted tumors.  Conclusions:   Altogether, our data suggest that PTEN deleted tumors expressing low levels of AR may represent a worse prognostic subset of PCa establishing a challenge for therapeutic management.""","""['Khalil Choucair', 'Joshua Ejdelman', 'Fadi Brimo', 'Armen Aprikian', 'Simone Chevalier', 'Jacques Lapointe']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['PTEN genomic deletion is associated with p-Akt and AR signalling in poorer outcome, hormone refractory prostate cancer.', 'Interaction of the Androgen Receptor, ETV1, and PTEN Pathways in Mouse Prostate Varies with Pathological Stage and Predicts Cancer Progression.', 'Molecular profiling of ETS and non-ETS aberrations in prostate cancer patients from northern India.', 'Interplay Among PI3K/AKT, PTEN/FOXO and AR Signaling in Prostate Cancer.', 'Genomic Rearrangements of PTEN in Prostate Cancer.', 'Emerging RNA-Based Therapeutic and Diagnostic Options: Recent Advances and Future Challenges in Genitourinary Cancers.', 'Race and prostate cancer: genomic landscape.', 'Fatty acid oxidation enzyme Δ3, Δ2-enoyl-CoA isomerase 1 (ECI1) drives aggressive tumor phenotype and predicts poor clinical outcome in prostate cancer patients.', 'Intraductal Carcinoma of the Prostate as a Cause of Prostate Cancer Metastasis: A Molecular Portrait.', 'The Crosstalk of Long Non-Coding RNA and MicroRNA in Castration-Resistant and Neuroendocrine Prostate Cancer: Their Interaction and Clinical Importance.']"""

Methods:   Coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) microscopy was employed to examine the lipid content of CTC isolated from the peripheral blood of metastatic prostate cancer patients. CARS microscopy was also employed to evaluate lipid uptake and mobilization kinetics of a metastatic human prostate cancer cell line.  Results:   One hundred CTC from eight metastatic prostate cancer patients exhibited strong CARS signal which arose from intracellular lipid. In contrast, leukocytes exhibited weak CARS signal which arose mostly from cellular membrane. On average, CARS signal intensity of prostate CTC was 7-fold higher than that of leukocytes (P<0.0000001). When incubated with human plasma, C4-2 metastatic human prostate cancer cells exhibited rapid lipid uptake kinetics and slow lipid mobilization kinetics. Higher expression of lipid transport proteins in C4-2 cells compared to non-transformed RWPE-1 and non-malignant BPH-1 prostate epithelial cells further indicated strong affinity for lipid of metastatic prostate cancer cells.

The threshold of the tumor injury was determined for human prostate tumor model, and the threshold value (600-1300 V cm(-1)) is dependent on the IRE parameters including pulse duration and pulse number. This dependence was explained in the context of tissue electrical conductivity change during IRE. Further, the thermal injury was found not to be a dominant factor in IRE with our system, which is in agreement with previous numerical studies.

Methods:   A total of 37 patients with PC and rising prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels were subjected to (68)Ga-PSMA positron emission tomography (PET)/CT. Quantitative assessment of tracer uptake was performed 1 and 3 h post-injection (p.i.) by analysis of mean and maximum standardized uptake values (SUVmean/max) of several organs and 65 tumour lesions. Subsequently, tumour to background ratios were calculated.  Results:   The PET/CT images showed intense tracer uptake in both kidneys and salivary glands. Moderate uptake was seen in lacrimal glands, liver, spleen and in small and large bowel. Quantitative assessment revealed excellent contrast between tumour lesions and most normal tissues. Of 37 patients, 31 (83.8 %) showed at least one lesion suspicious for cancer at a detection rate of 60 % at PSA <2.2 ng/ml and 100 % at PSA >2.2 ng/ml. Median tumour to background ratios were 18.8 (2.4-158.3) in early images and 28.3 (2.9-224.0) in late images.  Conclusion:   The biodistribution of the novel (68)Ga-PSMA tracer and its ability to detect PC lesions was analysed in 37 patients.

Research on the mechanisms of prostate cancer progression has been limited by the lack of suitable in vitro systems. A hurdle in understanding the molecular genetic changes in prostate cancer has been the difficulty in establishing premalignant lesions and primary prostate tumors as in vitro cell cultures. Primary prostate epithelial cells grow for a finite life span and then senesce. Immortalization is defined by continuous growth of otherwise senescing cells and is believed to represent an early stage in tumor progression. To examine these early stages, we and others have developed in vitro models of prostate epithelial cell immortalization. Methods are described for the processing of primary human prostate biopsy samples and the generation of human prostate epithelial (HPE) cells in serum-free conditions. Retrovirus containing human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) is used for the immortalization of primary HPE cells, and the methods for the characterization of HPE cell lines are discussed. These in vitro prostate cell culture models are useful for the study of prostate normal and cancer stem cells, are critical for defining the mechanisms of prostate cancer progression and for testing preventive and therapeutic regimens.""","""['Johng S Rhim']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Methods Mol Biol""","""['Novel human prostate epithelial cell culture models for the study of carcinogenesis and of normal stem cells and cancer stem cells.', 'In vitro human cell culture models for the study of prostate cancer.', 'A novel human cancer culture model for the study of prostate cancer.', 'Novel Human Prostate Epithelial Cell Cultures.', 'Research into molecular and genetic mechanisms underlying prostate carcinogenesis would be greatly advanced by in vitro prostate cell models.', 'Live-single-cell phenotypic cancer biomarkers-future role in precision oncology?']"""

Furthermore, we assess the results of salvage cryotherapy (with intermediate follow-up) stratified by pre-treatment prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels to determine which patients may best be suited for treatment.  Methods:   The COLD registry was developed as a prospective, centrally collected database among patients undergoing salvage cryoablation for locally recurrent prostate cancer following primary prostate radiotherapy with curative intent. Of the patients undergoing salvage cryotherapy (without neoadjuvant hormonal ablative therapy), complete medical records were available in 156 patients, with their mean follow-up being 3.8 years (0.9-12.7 years). The treatment outcomes of salvage cryotherapy were assessed using the Phoenix definition (nadir PSA + 2 ng/ml) of biochemical failure.  Results:   Of our entire study population, the biochemical disease-free survival (bDFS) rates at 1, 2, and 3 years were 89.0, 73.7, and 66.7%, respectively. Stratification of our patients into two subgroups is based on their pre-treatment total serum PSA values <5 and ≥5 ng/ml, and bDFS rates at 3 years for these two subgroups were 78.3 and 52.9%, respectively. A Kaplan-Meier analysis of bDFS stratified by these same pre-treatment PSA values revealed that the subset of patients with a PSA ≥ 5 ng/ml had statistically significant poorer bDFS rates (P = 0.01).

To explore this hypothesis further, we investigated effect modification by Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) variation on this association. We hypothesized that TLR4 variation might serve a marker of the anti-trichomonad immune response because T. vaginalis has been shown to elicit inflammation through this receptor.  Methods:   We previously genotyped the non-synonymous TLR4 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs4986790, and determined T. vaginalis serostatus for 690 incident prostate cancer cases and 692 controls in a nested case-control study within the Health Professionals Follow-up Study.  Results:   A non-significant suggestion of effect modification was observed by rs4986790 carrier status on the association between T. vaginalis serostatus and prostate cancer risk (p interaction = 0.07). While no association was observed among men homozygous wildtype for this SNP (odds ratio (OR) = 1.23, 95 % confidence interval (CI): 0.86-1.77), a positive association was observed among variant carriers (OR = 4.16, 95 % CI: 1.32-13.1).

Methods:   GA Comprehensive Cancer Registry PrCA incidence data were obtained for 1998-2008. Directly standardized age-adjusted PrCA incidence rates per 100,000 were analyzed by race, stage, grade, and county. County-level hotspots of PrCA incidence were analyzed with the Getis-Ord Gi* statistic in a geographic information system; a census tract-level cluster analysis was performed with a Discrete Poisson model and implemented in SaTScan(®) software.  Results:   Significant (p < 0.05) hotspots of PrCA incidence were observed in nine southwestern counties and six centrally located counties among men of both races. Six significant (p < 0.1) clusters of PrCA incidence rates were detected for men of both races in north and northwest central Georgia. When stratified by race, clusters among white and black men were similar, although centroids were slightly shifted. Most notably, a large (122 km radius) cluster in northwest central Georgia was detected only in whites, and two smaller clusters (0-32 km radii) were detected in Southwest Georgia only in black men. Clusters of high-grade and late-stage tumors were identified primarily in the northern portion of the state among men of both races.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the characteristics of multiple malignancies and to analyze the risk of secondary malignancies after radiotherapy for prostate cancer.  Methods:   From 2000 to 2011, 150 patients with prostate cancer were treated with curative radiotherapy in our department. Patient age range was 54-92 years (median, 70 years), and the follow-up period was 4-142 months (median, 48 months). The incidence of multiple primary cancers was compared with the estimated incidence.  Results:   A total of 147 patients (98 %) survived more than 12 months (12-142 months; median, 48 months); 20/150 patients (13 %) died within 10 years. Cause of death was recurrent prostate cancer in 11 patients, other primary malignancies in 7 patients, and cardiovascular disease in 2 patients. Multiple primary cancers were present in 26 of 150 patients (17 %), including 16 subsequent malignancies (11 %) with latent periods of 13-83 months (median, 43 months). The subsequent non-prostate malignancies were lung cancer in 4 patients, urinary bladder or ureter cancer in 4, stomach cancer in 3, malignant lymphoma in 2, and other in 3. Analysis of the observed incidence of secondary malignancies compared with the estimated incidence in the general population revealed a higher incidence of ureter cancer and malignant lymphoma.

We studied the cytotoxic effects of camalexin treatment on prostate cancer cell lines and whether this was mediated by reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. As models, we utilized LNCaP and its aggressive subline, C4-2, as well as ARCaP cells stably transfected with empty vector (Neo) control or constitutively active Snail cDNA that represents an epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) model and displays increased cell migration and tumorigenicity. We confirmed previous studies showing that C4-2 and ARCaP-Snail cells express more ROS than LNCaP and ARCaP-Neo, respectively. Camalexin increased ROS, decreased cell proliferation, and increased apoptosis more significantly in C4-2 and ARCaP-Snail cells as compared to LNCaP and ARCaP-Neo cells, respectively, while normal prostate epithelial cells (PrEC) were unaffected. Increased caspase-3/7 activity and increased cleaved PARP protein shown by Western blot analysis was suggestive of increased apoptosis. The ROS scavenger N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) antagonized the effects of camalexin, whereas the addition of exogenous hydrogen peroxide potentiated the effects of camalexin, showing that camalexin is mediating its effects through ROS.

Both atRA and RASP dose-dependently inhibited angiogenesis in the chicken embryo chorioallantoic membrane model. RASP was more effective and could be used in a wider dose range due to lower toxicity compared with atRA. Both retinoids decreased the number of human umbilical vein endothelial and prostate cancer LNCaP and PC3 cells in a concentration-dependent manner. RASP was more effective and potent compared with atRA, spermine, their combination, or conjugates of spermine with other acidic retinoids and/or psoralens in prostate cancer cells. The inhibitory effect of both atRA and RASP seems to be related to an increase of the tumour repressing gene retinoic acid receptor beta mRNA, was mediated by retinoic acid receptor alpha, and was proportional to endogenous retinoic acid receptor beta expression.

These genes are known to be induced by transcription factor early growth response protein 1 (EGR1). BCA induces significant EGR1 upregulation, while EGR1 knockdown decreases the induction of these genes with concurrent alleviation of cell death by BCA. Antioxidant glutathione pretreatment with BCA removes EGR1 expression increase, suggesting that EGR1 upregulation is dependent on oxidative stress generated by BCA. In prostate cancer cells, EGR1 localizes in the cytoplasm; however, BCA remarkably upregulates EGR1 nuclear translocalization, suggesting its possible effect as a transcriptional activator. BCA induces transient upregulation of importin-7 (IPO7) which is critical for EGR1 nuclear translocation, and IPO7 knockdown led to a significant decrease in chemosensitivity to BCA. Taken together, our findings suggest that BCA induces prostate cancer cell death via EGR1 upregulation and nuclear translocalization, followed by activation of proapoptotic target genes.""","""['Hye-Sook Kang', 'Jiyeon Ock', 'Heon-Jin Lee', 'Yu-Jin Lee', 'Byoung-Mog Kwon', 'Su-Hyung Hong']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Cancer Lett""","""['EGR1-dependent PTEN upregulation by 2-benzoyloxycinnamaldehyde attenuates cell invasion and EMT in colon cancer.', 'E2F1 Induces tumor cell survival via nuclear factor-kappaB-dependent induction of EGR1 transcription in prostate cancer cells.', ""2'-Benzoyloxycinnamaldehyde-mediated DJ-1 upregulation protects MCF-7 cells from mitochondrial damage."", 'Egr1 transcription factor: multiple roles in prostate tumor cell growth and survival.', 'The transcription factor Egr1 is a direct regulator of multiple tumor suppressors including TGFbeta1, PTEN, p53, and fibronectin.', 'Assessment of Early Growth Response 1 in Tumor Suppression of Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma.', 'Early Growth Response 1 Strengthens Pol-III-Directed Transcription and Transformed Cell Proliferation by Controlling PTEN/AKT Signalling Activity.', 'EGR1/2 Inhibits Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma Cell Growth by Suppressing the Expression of PTEN and BAX.', 'Nanostructured Oxide-Based Systems for the pH-Triggered Release of Cinnamaldehyde.', 'Epstein-Barr Virus Limits the Accumulation of IPO7, an Essential Gene Product.']"""

Moreover, age and clinical stage have decreased as a result of earlier diagnosis. In this context, the risk of over-treatment including surgery may be important. The objective was to assess the evolution of pathological stages of radical prostatectomy (PR) to 5years apart.  Materials and methods:   Nine hundred and six PR were conducted in two French centers (503 in 2005 and 403 in 2010). Preoperative data (age, PSA, clinical stage, number of biopsies, Gleason score) and postoperative (pTNM, Gleason score, prostate weight) were analyzed and compared (Student test and Chi(2)).  Results:   In 2005 and 2010, the median age was respectively 62.85 and 62.52years (NS). The median PSA was 8.55 and 8.99ng/ml (NS). The number of positive biopsies increased significantly (2.30 to 2.88, P<0.0001), but not the biopsy Gleason score (6.34 to 6.43, NS). Clinical stage was significantly changed with T1c: 77.8 to 73%, T2a: 16.6 to 14.2%, T2b: 4 to 7.8%, T2c: 0 to 1%, T3: 1 to 3.9% T4: 0.4 to 0% in 2005 and 2010, respectively (P<0.0006). The average weight of prostate decreased significantly (55.6g versus 48.8g, P<0.0001), pathological Gleason score was unchanged (6.86 versus 6.80, NS). However, the pathological stage has changed significantly to tumours with higher stages pT2: 66.5 to 51.8% and pT3 33.5 to 48.1% (15%) (P=0.02).  Conclusion:   These results have shown that the number of PT performed for pT3 tumours has increased.

This biochemical recurrence typically predates clinically detectable metastatic disease by several years. Management of patients with biochemical recurrence is controversial.  Objective:   To assess the effect of dutasteride on progression of PCa in patients with biochemical failure after radical therapy.  Design, setting, and participants:   Randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 294 men from 64 centres across 9 European countries.  Intervention:   The 5α-reductase inhibitor, dutasteride.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The primary end point was time to PSA doubling from start of randomised treatment, analysed by log-rank test stratified by previous therapy and investigative-site cluster. Secondary end points included time to disease progression and the proportion of subjects with disease progression.  Results and limitations:   Of the 294 subjects randomised (147 in each treatment group), 187 (64%) completed 24 mo of treatment and 107 discontinued treatment prematurely (71 [48%] of the placebo group, 36 [24%] of the dutasteride group). Dutasteride significantly delayed the time to PSA doubling compared with placebo after 24 mo of treatment (p<0.001); the relative risk (RR) reduction was 66.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 50.35-76.90) for the overall study period. Dutasteride also significantly delayed disease progression (which included PSA- and non-PSA-related outcomes) compared with placebo (p<0.001); the overall RR reduction in favour of dutasteride was 59% (95% CI, 32.53-75.09). The incidence of adverse events (AEs), serious AEs, and AEs leading to study withdrawal were similar between the treatment groups. A limitation was that investigators were not blinded to PSA levels during the study.  Conclusions:   Dutasteride delayed the biochemical progression of PCa in patients with biochemical failure after radical therapy for clinically localised disease.

Proper documentation at the initial stage assists in establishing a foundation data. The authors are not aware of a documented pattern of malignant neoplasm in Ekiti State.  Objective:   The aim of this study is to update the available literature on malignant neoplasms and compare our findings with previous work done by other investigators.  Methods:   The estimates are based on a systematic retrospective survey of cancer cases identified in the Pathology Laboratories of Federal Medical Centre, Ido-Ekiti and University Teaching Hospital, Ado-Ekiti for the period; January 2002 to December 2009. The data recorded on each case were: source of information (histology or cytology), name, age, and sex, date of diagnosis and site of tumour. Tumour site and histology were coded according to the International Classification of Diseases, ICD-10 for presentation in tabular form.  Results:   A total of 498 cancers were recorded. There were 177 (35.5%) males with average age of 54.5 years and 321 (64.5%) females with average age of 48.6 years. The estimated Crude Incidence (CI) rates for all cancer sites are 14.7 for males and 27.4 for females, per 100,000 population. In males, the most frequent cancer is prostate cancer (37.9%) followed by cancer of the liver (10.7%) and NonHodgkin's Lymphoma, NHL (7.9%). In females, the most common cancer is that of the breast (49.3%) followed by the cervix (8.5%) and the ovary (5.32%). A total of 28 childhood cancers were registered (17 males, 11 females). The most frequent tumours were Burkitt's lymphoma (8 cases) and soft tissue sarcomas (3 cases).  Conclusion:   This study shows that malignant neoplasms are not uncommon in Ekiti State.

However, recent meta-analyses concluded that there is no consistent relation between circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations and prostate cancer, and several large studies have actually reported an increased risk of prostate cancer associated with high 25(OH)D.  Objective:   We aimed to assess the prospective relations between serum 25(OH)D, serum retinol, and risk of prostate cancer.  Design:   In this nested case-control study, Norwegian men who participated in population-based health studies between 1981 and 1991 were followed with respect to prostate cancer throughout 2006. For each case (n = 2106), a matched control was selected. Stored serum was analyzed for 25(OH)D by using HPLC atmospheric pressure chemical ionization mass spectrometry.  Results:   We showed a positive relation between an increasing 25(OH)D concentration and prostate cancer risk [rate ratio (RR): 1.15 (95% CI: 1.04, 1.27) per 30-nmol/L increase in 25(OH)D concentration]. Predefined analyses stratified by season showed no relation for subjects with serum collected during winter and spring (RR: 1.00 per 30-nmol/L increase), whereas a strengthened positive association [RR: 1.27 (95% CI: 1.09, 1.47) per 30-nmol/L increase] was observed in men with serum collected during the summer and autumn. There was no relation between serum retinol and prostate cancer.

Because the AR is amenable to targeting by small-molecule inhibitors, it remains the major druggable target for the advanced disease. Inflammation has also been implicated in the cancerous growth in the prostate. Here we show that 15-deoxy-Δ(12,14)-prostaglandin J(2) (15d-PGJ(2)), an endogenously produced antiinflammatory prostaglandin, targets the AR and acts as a potent AR inhibitor, rapidly repressing AR target genes, such as FKBP51 and TMPRSS2 in prostate cancer cells. However, exposure of prostate cancer cells to 15d-PGJ(2) does not simply evoke a general inhibition of nuclear receptor activity or transcription because under the same conditions, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ is activated by 15d-PGJ(2). Moreover, 15d-PGJ(2) rapidly triggers modifications of AR by small ubiquitin-related modifier-2/3 (SUMO-2/3), which may modulate the repressing effect of 15d-PGJ(2) on AR-dependent transcription. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays indicate that the inhibitory effect of 15d-PGJ(2) on FKBP51 and TMPRSS2 expression occurs in parallel with the inhibition of the AR binding to the regulatory regions of these genes. However, the DNA-binding activity is not the only AR function targeted by 15d-PGJ(2) because the prostaglandin also blunted the androgen-dependent interaction between the AR amino and carboxy termini. In conclusion, our results identify 15d-PGJ(2) as a potent and direct inhibitor of androgen signaling, suggesting novel possibilities in restricting the AR activity in prostate cancer cells.""","""['Sanna Kaikkonen', 'Ville Paakinaho', 'Päivi Sutinen', 'Anna-Liisa Levonen', 'Jorma J Palvimo']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Mol Endocrinol""","""['Inhibition of activator protein 1 activation, vascular endothelial growth factor, and cyclooxygenase-2 expression by 15-deoxy-Delta12,14-prostaglandin J2 in colon carcinoma cells: evidence for a redox-sensitive peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma-independent mechanism.', 'Inhibition of estrogen receptor beta-mediated human telomerase reverse transcriptase gene transcription via the suppression of mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling plays an important role in 15-deoxy-Delta(12,14)-prostaglandin J(2)-induced apoptosis in cancer cells.', '15-Deoxy-Delta12,14-prostaglandin J(2) induces death receptor 5 expression through mRNA stabilization independently of PPARgamma and potentiates TRAIL-induced apoptosis.', '15-deoxy-Delta12,14-prostaglandin J2 as a potential endogenous regulator of redox-sensitive transcription factors.', 'Anti- and proinflammatory effects of 15-deoxy-delta-prostaglandin J2(15d-PGJ2) on human eosinophil functions.', 'Genomic Insights into Non-steroidal Nuclear Receptors in Prostate and Breast Cancer.', 'Nuclear Receptor Coregulators in Hormone-Dependent Cancers.', 'TFEB, a master regulator of autophagy and biogenesis, unexpectedly promotes apoptosis in response to the cyclopentenone prostaglandin 15d-PGJ2.', 'AKR1C3 (type 5 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/prostaglandin F synthase): Roles in malignancy and endocrine disorders.', 'Crosstalk between the Androgen Receptor and PPAR Gamma Signaling Pathways in the Prostate.']"""

We previously reported anti-proliferative activity of deoxypodophyllotoxin (DPT) on human prostate cancer cells. Using the PC-3 cell model of human prostate cancer, the present study reveals that DPT induced apoptosis via a caspase-3-dependent pathway that is activated due to dysregulated mitochondrial function. DPT-treated cells showed accumulation of the reactive oxygen species (ROS), intracellular Ca (i)(2+) surge, increased mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP, ΔΨ(m)), Bax protein translocation to mitochondria and cytochrome c release to the cytoplasm. This resulted in caspase-3 activation, which in turn induced apoptosis. The antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) reduced ROS accumulation, MMP and Ca (i)(2+) surge, on the other hand the Ca(2+) chelator BAPTA inhibited the Ca( i)(2+) overload and MMP without affecting the increase of ROS, indicating that the generation of ROS occurred prior to Ca(2+) flux. This suggested that both ROS and Ca( i)(2+) signaling play roles in the increased MMP via Ca (i)(2+)-dependent and/or -independent mechanisms, since ΔΨ(m) elevation was reversed by NAC and BAPTA.

The scale invariant feature transformation (SIFT) has been employed to capture the information of the local patch surrounding the boundary. However, when SIFT feature being used for segmentation, the scale and variance are not specified with the location of the point of interest. To deal with it, the discriminant analysis in machine learning is introduced to measure the distinctiveness of the learned SIFT features for each landmark directly and to make the scale and variance adaptive to the locations. As the gray values and gradients vary significantly over the boundary of the prostate, separate appearance descriptors are built for each landmark and then optimized.

We have demonstrated this principle using in vitro and in vivo proliferative endpoints; however, the contributions of NE-derived pro-survival factors and anti-apoptosis to this phenomenon have not been thoroughly investigated.  Methods:   Here, we utilized conditioned-medium (CM) from LNCaP cells, engineered to undergo NE differentiation, and examined its effects on PC3 and LNCaP cell survival.  Results:   Statistically significant changes in clonogenic survival, Annexin V staining, PARP cleavage and trypan blue positivity of approximately twofold were observed in the presence of NE-derived CM relative to control-CM for both LNCaP and PC3 cells. These changes were partially abrogated by antagonists of the neuropeptides neurotensin, bombesin, and PTHrP. Selective inhibitors of IGF-1R, EGFR or Src caused significant and nearly complete blockade of prostate cancer cell survival due to NE secretions. Similar increases in cell survival were observed for LNCaP or PC3 cells treated with NE-derived medium in the presence of docetaxel.

In a previous study we described overexpression of MCT2 in prostate carcinoma raising the hypothesis of using MCT2 as a possible biomarker in prostate cancer. With the present study we aimed to compare the pattern of expression of MCT2 and alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase (AMACR), in prostate carcinoma, PIN lesions, non-neoplastic prostate tissue, and normal prostate and compare their sensitivity and specificity. Also, we wanted to evaluate the value of using MCT2 in combination with AMACR and the negative markers 34βE12 or p63 to detect prostate cancer.  Methods:   A total of 349 cases, including prostate carcinoma, non-neoplastic prostate tissue and PIN lesions, from radical prostatectomies were examined by immunohistochemistry for AMACR, MCT2, p63, and 34βE12, using tissue microarrays (TMAs). Normal prostate from radical cystoprostatectomy was also studied.  Results:   Our study revealed that MCT2, similarly to AMACR, was consistently expressed in prostate cancer regardless of the Gleason score. In combination with AMACR and p63 or 34βE12, MCT2 helped to improve the diagnosis of prostate carcinoma. Also, overexpression of MCT2 as well as AMACR in PIN lesions may indicate the involvement of these two proteins in prostate cancer initiation.  Conclusions:   We provided evidence for the presence of MCT2 in prostate cancer, selectively labeling malignant glands.

Prostate cancer cells secrete ligands of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and EGFR signaling could play an important role in the cross-talk between mesenchymal stem cells and prostate cancer cells. In this study, we showed that treatment of human primary MSCs with conditioned medium (CM) derived from the bone metastatic PC3 carcinoma cells (PC3-CM) resulted in: a significant activation of EGFR; increased proliferation; increased osteoblastic but decreased adipocitic differentiation; inhibition of senescence induced by serum starvation; increased CCL5 secretion. These activities were significantly inhibited in the presence of the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor gefitinib. PC3-CM directly inhibited osteoclastogenesis as well as the ability of osteoblasts to induce osteoclast differentiation. The increased MSCs migration by PC3-CM and PC3 cells was partially mediated by CCL5. MSC-CM increased the formation of colonies by PC3 cells and inhibited the anti-proliferative activity of Docetaxel. Activation of EGFR expressed on MSCs by PC3-CM enhanced their capability to increase PC3 cells proliferation and to inhibit Docetaxel activity. These findings, by showing that the tumor-promoting interactions between PC3 cells and MSCs are mediated, at least in part, by EGFR, suggest a novel application of the EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors in the treatment of prostate cancer.""","""['Cinzia Borghese', 'Lara Cattaruzza', 'Eliana Pivetta', 'Nicola Normanno', 'Antonella De Luca', 'Mario Mazzucato', 'Marta Celegato', 'Alfonso Colombatti', 'Donatella Aldinucci']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Cell Biochem""","""['Self-assembling nanoparticles encapsulating zoledronic acid inhibit mesenchymal stromal cells differentiation, migration and secretion of proangiogenic factors and their interactions with prostate cancer cells.', 'Role of the EGFR ligand/receptor system in the secretion of angiogenic factors in mesenchymal stem cells.', 'Suppression of EGF-R signaling reduces the incidence of prostate cancer metastasis in nude mice.', 'Tumor microenvironment: bone marrow-mesenchymal stem cells as key players.', 'Emerging Players in Prostate Cancer-Bone Niche Communication.', 'Transcription Factors STAT3 and MYC Are Key Players of Human Platelet Lysate-Induced Cell Proliferation.', 'Bone Marrow-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells Migrate toward Hormone-Insensitive Prostate Tumor Cells Expressing TGF-β via N-Cadherin.', 'Blocking the CCL5-CCR5 Axis Using Maraviroc Promotes M1 Polarization of Macrophages Cocultured with Irradiated Hepatoma Cells.', 'Research Trends and Regulation of CCL5 in Prostate Cancer.', 'The CCL5/CCR5 Axis in Cancer Progression.']"""

We hypothesized resveratrol will slow the growth of human prostate cancer xenografts.  Methods:   SCID mice were fed Western diet (40% fat, 44% carbohydrate, 16% protein by kcal). One week later, human prostate cancer cells, either LAPC-4 (151 mice) or LNCaP (94 mice) were injected subcutaneously. Three weeks after injection, LAPC-4 mice were randomized to Western diet (control group), Western diet plus resveratrol 50 mg/kg/day, or Western diet plus resveratrol 100 mg/kg/day. The LNCaP mice were randomized to Western diet or Western diet plus resveratrol 50 mg/kg/day. Mice were sacrificed when tumors reached 1,000 mm(3). Survival differences among groups were assessed using Cox proportional hazards. Serum insulin and IGF axis were assessed using ELISAs. Gene expression was analyzed using Affymetrix gene arrays.  Results:   Compared to control in the LAPC-4 study, resveratrol was associated with decreased survival (50 mg/kg/day--HR 1.53, P = 0.04; 100 mg/kg/day--HR 1.22, P = 0.32). In the LNCaP study, resveratrol did not change survival (HR 0.77, P = 0.22). In combined analysis of both resveratrol 50 mg/kg/day groups, IGF-1 was decreased (P = 0.05) and IGFBP-2 was increased (P = 0.01). Resveratrol induced different patterns of gene expression changes in each xenograft model, with upregulation of oncogenic pathways E2F3 and beta-catenin in LAPC-4 tumors.  Conclusion:   Resveratrol was associated with significantly worse survival with LAPC-4 tumors, but unchanged survival with LNCaP.

For the most part, these estimates were calculated using models recommended in the recent National Academy of Sciences' (BEIR VII) report on health effects from low levels of ionizing radiation. The new risk assessment includes uncertainty bounds associated with the projections for gender and cancer site-specific lifetime attributable risks. For most cancer sites, these uncertainty bounds were calculated using probability distributions for BEIR VII model parameter values, derived from a novel Bayesian analysis of cancer incidence data from the atomic bomb survivor lifespan study (LSS) cohort and subjective distributions for other relevant sources of uncertainty. This approach allowed for quantification of uncertainties associated with: 1) the effect of sampling variability on inferences drawn from the LSS cohort about the linear dose response and its dependence on temporal factors such as age-at-exposure, 2) differences in the radiogenic risks in the Japanese LSS cohort versus the U.S. population, 3) dosimetry errors, and 4) several other non-sampling sources. Some of the uncertainty associated with how risk depends on dose and dose rate was also quantified. For uniform whole-body exposures of low-dose gamma radiation to the entire population, EPA's cancer incidence risk coefficients and corresponding 90% uncertainty intervals (Gy) are 9.55 × 10 (4.3 × 10 to 1.8 × 10) for males and 1.35 × 10 (6.5 × 10 to 2.5 × 10) for females, where the numbers in parentheses represent an estimated 90% uncertainty interval. For many individual cancer sites, risk coefficients differ from corresponding uncertainty bounds by factors of about three to five, although uncertainties are larger for cancers of the stomach, prostate, liver, and uterus.

However, they do not account for the spatial dose distribution. This study proposes a metric based on both surface dose and distance that can predict the incidence of rectal bleeding in prostate cancer patients treated with radical radiotherapy. One hundred and forty-four patients treated with radical radiotherapy for prostate cancer were prospectively followed to record the incidence of grade ≥2 rectal bleeding. Radiotherapy plans were used to evaluate a dose-distance metric that accounts for the dose and its spatial distribution on the rectal surface, characterized by a logistic weighting function with slope a and inflection point d₀. This was compared to the effective dose obtained from dose-surface histograms, characterized by the parameter n which describes sensitivity to hot spots. The log-rank test was used to determine statistically significant (p < 0.05) cut-off values for the dose-distance metric and effective dose that predict for the occurrence of rectal bleeding. For the dose-distance metric, only d₀ = 25 and 30 mm combined with a > 5 led to statistical significant cut-offs. For the effective dose metric, only values of n in the range 0.07-0.35 led to statistically significant cut-offs. The proposed dose-distance metric is a predictor of rectal bleeding in prostate cancer patients treated with radiotherapy.

Recent evidence suggests that EZH2 may also have a role in rhabdoid tumors. Atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor (ATRT) is a rare, high-grade embryonal brain tumor that occurs most commonly in young children and carries a very poor prognosis. ATRTs are characterized by absence of the chromatin remodeling protein SMARCB1. Given the role of EZH2 in regulating epigenetic changes, we investigated the role of EZH2 in ATRT.  Methods:   Microarray analysis was used to evaluate expression of EZH2 in ATRT tumor samples. We used shRNA and a chemical inhibitor of EZH2 to examine the impact of EZH2 inhibition on cell growth, proliferation, and tumor cell self-renewal.  Results:   Here, we show that targeted disruption of EZH2 by RNAi or pharmacologic inhibition strongly impairs ATRT cell growth, suppresses tumor cell self-renewal, induces apoptosis, and potently sensitizes these cells to radiation. Using functional analysis of transcription factor activity, we found the cyclin D1-E2F axis to be repressed after EZH2 depletion in ATRT cells.

Objective:   Our objective was to characterize prostate biopsy outcomes and trends in Chinese men over a 10-year period, since the increasing use of PSA tests.  Methods:   All men (n = 1,650) who underwent prostate biopsy for PCa at Huashan Hospital, Shanghai, China from 2003-2011 were evaluated. Demographic and clinical information was collected for each patient, including age, digital rectal examination (DRE), transrectal ultrasound (prostate volume and nodule), total prostate-specific antigen (tPSA) levels and free PSA ratio (fPSA/tPSA) prior to biopsy. Prostate biopsy was performed using six cores before October 2007 or ten cores thereafter. Logistic regression and multivariate analysis were used to evaluate our data.  Results:   The overall positive rate of prostate biopsy for PCa was 47% and the rate decreased significantly over the years from 74% in 2003 to 33% in 2011 (P-trend = 0.004). Age at diagnosis was slightly increased (P-trend = 0.04) while fPSA/tPSA was significantly decreased (P-trend = 1.11×10-5). A statistically significant trend was not observed for tPSA levels, prostate volume, or proportion of positive nodule. The model including multiple demographic and clinical variables (i.e., age, DRE, tPSA, fPSA/tPSA and transrectal ultrasound results) (AUC = 0.93) statistically outperformed models that included only PSA (AUC = 0.85) or fPSA/tPSA (AUC = 0.66) to predict PCa risks (P<0.05). Similar results were observed in a subgroup of men whose tPSA levels were lower than 20 ng/mL (AUC = 0.87, vs. AUC of tPSA = 0.62, P<0.05).  Conclusions:   Detection rates of PCa and high-grade PCa among men that underwent prostate biopsy at the institution has decreased significantly in the past 10 years, likely due to increasing use of PSA tests. Predictive performance of demographic and clinical variables of PCa was excellent. These variables should be used in clinics to determine the need for prostate biopsy.""","""['Rong Na', 'Haowen Jiang', 'Seong-Tae Kim', 'Yishuo Wu', 'Shijun Tong', 'Limin Zhang', 'Jianfeng Xu', 'Yinghao Sun', 'Qiang Ding']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Age-specific prostate specific antigen cutoffs for guiding biopsy decision in Chinese population.', 'The influence of prostate volume on cancer detection in the Chinese population.', 'Performance of serum prostate-specific antigen isoform -2proPSA (p2PSA) and the prostate health index (PHI) in a Chinese hospital-based biopsy population.', 'Prostate health index vs percent free prostate-specific antigen for prostate cancer detection in men with ""gray"" prostate-specific antigen levels at first biopsy: systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Screening for prostate cancer in 2008 II: the importance of molecular subforms of prostate-specific antigen and tissue kallikreins.', 'Burden of Prostate Cancer in China, 1990-2019: Findings From the 2019 Global Burden of Disease Study.', 'Prostate health index is useful for prostate cancer detecting in Chinese people.', 'Using the prostate imaging reporting and data system version 2 (PI-RIDS v2) to detect prostate cancer can prevent unnecessary biopsies and invasive treatment.', 'Evaluation of PSA-age volume score in predicting prostate cancer in Chinese population.', 'TRUS Biopsy Yield in Indian Population: A Retrospective Analysis.']"""

Although microRNAs are frequently dysregulated in human cancers, the influence of microRNAs on PCa malignancy and whether targeting TIC-associated microRNAs inhibit PCa progression remain unclear. In this study, we found that miR-320 is significantly downregulated in PCa. Overexpression of miR-320 in PCa cells decreases PCa tumorigenesis in vitro and in vivo. Global gene expression profiling of miR-320-overexpressing PCa cells reveals that downstream target genes of Wnt/β-catenin pathway and cancer stem cell markers are significantly decreased. MicroRNA-320 inhibits β-catenin expression by targeting the 3'-untranslated region of β-catenin mRNA. The reduction of miR-320 associated with increased β-catenin was also found in CD44(high) subpopulation of prostate cancer cells and clinical PCa specimens. Interestingly, knockdown of miR-320 significantly increases the cancer stem-like properties, such as tumorsphere formation, chemoresistance and tumorigenic abilities, although enriching the population of stem-like TICs among PCa cells. Furthermore, increased miR-320 expression in prostate stem-like TICs significantly suppresses stem cell-like properties of PCa cells.

The development of prostate cancer from small regions of hyperplasia to invasive tumors requires genetic and epigenetic alterations of critical cellular components to aid in the development of cells more adapted for aberrant growth. The p53 transcription factor is a critical element in the cell's ability to regulate the cell cycle and its response to DNA damage. Mutations within the DNA-binding domain of p53 are common and allow the formation of tetramers; however, these alterations prevent this protein complex from associating with target gene promoters. In the present study, we examined the effects of p53 functionality in prostate cancer cells that harbored wild-type (WT) or mutant forms of the protein in response to commonly used chemotherapeutic drugs. The androgen receptor positive 22Rv-1 and LNCaP prostate cancer cell lines carry WT p53 and were demonstrated to have a decrease in chemotherapeutic drug sensitivity when transfected with a dominant-negative (DN) p53. Conversely, expression of the WT p53 in the p53-mutated and more advanced DU145 prostate cancer cell line significantly increased its overall sensitivity to anti-neoplastic drugs. Furthermore, analysis of colony formation in soft agar revealed that the functional status of p53 in each cell line altered the cell's ability to proliferate in an anchorage-independent fashion. Prostate cancer colony growth was more prevalent when p53 transcriptional activity was decreased, whereas growth was more limited in the presence of functional p53. These results demonstrate that the functional status of the tumor suppressor p53 is important in the progression of prostate cancer and dictates the overall effectiveness a given drug would have on disease treatment.""","""['William H Chappell', 'Brian D Lehmann', 'David M Terrian', 'Stephen L Abrams', 'Linda S Steelman', 'James A McCubrey']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Cell Cycle""","""['MDM2 antagonists boost antitumor effect of androgen withdrawal: implications for therapy of prostate cancer.', 'Comparison of the antitumor effects of an MDM2 inhibitor, nutlin-3, in feline lymphoma cell lines with or without p53 mutation.', 'MDM2 Inhibition Sensitizes Prostate Cancer Cells to Androgen Ablation and Radiotherapy in a p53-Dependent Manner.', 'Pharmacologic activation of p53 by small-molecule MDM2 antagonists.', 'Nutlins and ionizing radiation in cancer therapy.', 'In Vitro Antiproliferative Effects and Phytochemical Characterization of Carissa edulis ((Forssk) Vahl) and Pappea capensis (Eckyl and Zeyh) Extracts.', 'The CDK7 inhibitor CT7001 (Samuraciclib) targets proliferation pathways to inhibit advanced prostate cancer.', 'CRISPR screens reveal genetic determinants of PARP inhibitor sensitivity and resistance in prostate cancer.', 'Antrodia salmonea Extracts Regulate p53-AR Signaling and Apoptosis in Human Prostate Cancer LNCaP Cells.', 'Biological Response of Human Cancer Cells to Ionizing Radiation in Combination with Gold Nanoparticles.']"""

Method:   Among 167 oncology outpatients with breast, prostate, lung, or brain cancer and 85 of their FCs, growth mixture modeling (GMM) was used to identify latent classes of individuals based on Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression (CES-D) scores obtained prior to, during, and for four months following completion of radiation therapy. One hundred four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and haplotypes in 15 candidate cytokine genes were interrogated for differences between the two largest latent classes. Multivariate logistic regression analyses assessed effects of phenotypic and genotypic characteristics on class membership.  Results:   Four latent classes were confirmed: Resilient (56.3%), Subsyndromal (32.5%), Delayed (5.2%), and Peak (6.0%). Participants who were younger, female, non-white, and who reported higher baseline trait and state anxiety were more likely to be in the Subsyndromal, Delayed, or Peak groups.

Caucasians were genotyped for 109 haplotype-tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in CYP17A1, ESR1, CYP19A1, and HSD3B1, and their prognostic significance on disease progression was assessed using Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Cox regression models. Positive findings, including previously identified SRD5A1, SRD5A2, HSD17B2, HSD17B3, and HSD17B12 polymorphisms, were then explored in Taiwanese men (n = 32 SNPs). The influence of positive markers on the circulating hormonal levels was then appraised in Caucasians using specific and sensitive mass spectrometry-based methods.  Results:   After adjusting for known risk factors, variants of CYP17A1 (rs6162), HSD17B2 (rs4243229 and rs7201637), and ESR1 (rs1062577) were associated with progressive disease in both cohorts.

However, the exact site of local recurrence often remains undetermined. The present study shows that roughly one out of five patients with local recurrence after RP has histologically confirmed tumour deposits at the resection site of the vas deferens, clearly above the anastomotic site. This should be considered when offering 'blind' radiotherapy to the anastomotic site in patients with biochemical recurrence alone.  Objective:   To determine the anatomical pattern of local recurrence and the corresponding clinical and pathological variables of patients treated with retropubic radical prostatectomy (RRP).  Patients and methods:   In all, 41 patients with biopsy confirmed local recurrence after extended pelvic lymph node dissection and RRP performed between January 1992 and December 2009 at a single tertiary referral academic centre were retrospectively studied. The site of local recurrence as assessed on computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging was reviewed. Two sites were identified: the vesicourethral anastomotic site and the cranial resection margin of the surgical bed, where the vas deferens was transected and clipped. Age and serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level at RRP, pathological tumour and nodal stage, Gleason score, tumour location, surgical margin status, age and serum PSA level at the time of local recurrence, and time to diagnosis of local recurrence were assessed for the two sites and compared with the chi-square or Wilcoxon rank sum tests as appropriate.  Results:   Local recurrence occurred at the anastomotic site in 31/41 (76%) patients and at the resection site of the vas deferens in nine of 41 (22%) patients. One patient had distinct lesions at both sites. There was no significant difference in any of the clinical and pathological variables between patients with local recurrence in the former and latter site.

AND WHAT DOES THE STUDY ADD?: Removing of prostate for the treatment of localized prostate cancer is associated with a variable loss of erectile function due to injury of the nerves of erection during operation. Some researchers have reported that after nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy (RP), the natural recovery time of erectile function is at least 2 years. Factors such as thermal damage, ischaemic injury, mechanically induced nerve stretching and the local inflammatory effects of surgical trauma may also impair the cavernous nerves during RP. The concept of penile rehabilitation was first studied by Montorsi et al. in 1997. They showed that the use of any drug or device at or after RP could maximize the recovery of erectile function. Penile rehabilitation programmes (PRPs) with vasoactive agents, such as oral phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors (PDE5Is), intraurethral and intracavernosal vasoactive agents, and vacuum erection devices (VEDs) can protect erectile tissue integrity and prevent corporal smooth muscle atrophy and diminish collagen formation. The present findings are consistent with previous reports that PRPs have a significant beneficial effect on early erectile function recovery and that preoperative erectile function is one of the important predictors of erectile function after RP. Patients can be referred for penile rehabilitation if they have any degree of erectile function (mild, moderate or normal) before operation. We also showed that the combination of PDE5Is and VEDs for PRPs offers the shortest erectile function recovery period.  Objective:   To define the optimal penile rehabilitation programme (PRP) based on preoperative Sexual Health Inventory for Men (SHIM) scores after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP).  Patients and methods:   The medical records of 203 patients who underwent bilateral nerve-sparing RARP between 2007 and 2011 were reviewed for the present retrospective study. According to patients' preoperative erection status, group 1 (SHIM = 8-16), group 2 (SHIM = 17-21) and group 3 (SHIM = 22-25) were defined. After bilateral nerve-sparing RARP, phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors (PDE5Is), a vacuum erection device (VED), the combination of PDE5Is and a VED, or none of them were utilized by all patients for penile rehabilitation. Treatment success was defined as a rigid erection suitable for successful sexual intercourse.  Results:   The numbers of patients in groups 1, 2 and 3, respectively, were 9, 22 and 73, and the mean erectile function recovery periods (EFRPs) were 15.44 ± 7.73, 12.31 ± 8.12 and 8.73 ± 5.67 months (P < 0.05). Group 3 offered the best results for EFRP. Only PDE5Is or the combination of PDE5Is and VED use had a beneficial effect on EFRP (P < 0.05). Using PDE5Is and VED together provided the best result, but there was no difference between PDE5Is and a VED (P ≥ 0.05).  Conclusions:   After bilateral nerve-sparing RARP, PRP with PDE5Is, including the combination of PDE5Is and VED, has a beneficial effect on erectile function recovery across all levels of baseline erectile function. Further large randomized control studies are needed to validate these findings.""","""['Seref Basal', 'Chris Wambi', 'Cengizhan Acikel', 'Mantu Gupta', 'Ketan Badani']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Predicting participation in and successful outcome of a penile rehabilitation programme using a phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor with a vacuum erection device after radical prostatectomy.', 'Comparison of efficacy and satisfaction profile, between penile prosthesis implantation and oral PDE5 inhibitor tadalafil therapy, in men with nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy erectile dysfunction.', 'Erectile rehabilitation with intracavernous alprostadil after radical prostatectomy: refusal and dropout rates.', 'Penile rehabilitation after radical prostatectomy: what the evidence really says.', 'Update on erectile dysfunction in prostate cancer patients.', 'Vacuum erection device for erectile function rehabilitation after radical prostatectomy: which is the correct schedule?

Short-term success is well understood, but there is scarce data about effect of age on outcome, quality of life and catheter-free rates.  Methods:   One hundred consecutive patients who presented in urinary retention and underwent TURP were identified. Patients were followed up for 3 years to establish the rate of catheter dependence, incontinence, pad usage and quality of life using the International Prostate Symptom Score.  Results:   Data were obtained from 95 patients with mean age of 75.6 years and mean follow-up of 704 days. A total of 14 had died and 23 had prostate cancer. Eighty-seven per cent was passing urine and 13% was catheter dependent. Mean age of catheter-dependent patients was 84.9 years compared with 74.3 years in catheter-free men (P < 0.0001). Twenty-four per cent of patients 80 years and older were catheter dependent (P = 0.0039), 22% with prostate cancer were catheter dependent (P = 0.15). Fifty per cent of those who had died were catheter dependent (P = 0.0002). Thirty-one per cent of patients reported leakage of urine but only 5% reported leakage requiring pad use. Overall, the mean quality of life score was 1.08.  Conclusion:   Outcome after TURP for urinary retention is satisfactory. Advanced age is associated with higher long-term failure requiring catheterization, although it is still recommended in the elderly where an anaesthetic is safe. A high proportion of patients report urine leakage but the majority of this is clinically insignificant.

Using logistic regression, odds ratios of each body mass index category for risk of prostate cancer and high-grade disease (Gleason score ≥4 + 3) were estimated after controlling for age, prostate-specific antigen, %free prostate-specific antigen, prostate volume, digital rectal examination findings, family history of prostate cancer and the number of biopsy cores.

Results:   A significant positive association was observed between body mass index and prostate cancer risk at biopsy, with an increased risk observed in men whose body mass index was ≥27.0 compared with the reference group. A significantly increased risk starting at body mass index ≥25.0 was found in high-grade disease. In contrast to our results, there has been no reported increase in the risk of prostate cancer at biopsy in Caucasians within the overweight range (body mass index of 25.0-29.9 based on World Health Organization classification).

Prostate cancer (CaP) risk and prognosis are adversely correlated with a number of inflammatory and angiogenic mediators, including Toll-like receptors (TLRs), NF-κB and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Peroxiredoxin 1 (Prx1) was recently identified as an endogenous ligand for TLR4 that is secreted from CaP cells and promotes inflammation. Inhibition of Prx1 by CaP cells resulted in reduced expression of VEGF, diminished tumor vasculature and retarded tumor growth. The mechanism by which Prx1 regulates VEGF expression in normoxic conditions was investigated in the current study. Our results show that incubation of mouse vascular endothelial cells with recombinant Prx1 caused increases in VEGF expression that was dependent upon TLR4 and required hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) interaction with the VEGF promoter. The induction of VEGF was also dependent upon NF-κB; however, NF-κB interaction with the VEGF promoter was not required for Prx1 induction of VEGF suggesting that NF-κB was acting indirectly to induce VEGF expression. The results presented here show that Prx1 stimulation increased NF-κB interaction with the HIF-1α promoter, leading to enhanced promoter activity and increases in HIF-1α mRNA levels, as well as augmented HIF-1 activity that resulted in VEGF expression. Prx1 induced HIF-1 also promoted NF-κB activity, suggesting the presence of a positive feedback loop that has the potential to perpetuate Prx1 induction of angiogenesis. Strikingly, inhibition of Prx1 expression in CaP was accompanied with reduced expression of HIF-1α. The combined findings of the current study and our previous study suggest that Prx1 interaction with TLR4 promotes CaP growth potentially through chronic activation of tumor angiogenesis.""","""['Jonah R Riddell', 'Patricia Maier', 'Stephanie N Sass', 'Michael T Moser', 'Barbara A Foster', 'Sandra O Gollnick']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['A hypoxia-dependent upregulation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 by nuclear factor-κB promotes gastric tumour growth and angiogenesis.', 'Synergistic up-regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in macrophages by adenosine A2A receptor agonists and endotoxin involves transcriptional regulation via the hypoxia response element in the VEGF promoter.', 'Peroxiredoxin 1 controls prostate cancer growth through Toll-like receptor 4-dependent regulation of tumor vasculature.', 'Chronic and Cycling Hypoxia: Drivers of Cancer Chronic Inflammation through HIF-1 and NF-κB Activation: A Review of the Molecular Mechanisms.', 'Regulation of cells of the arterial wall by hypoxia and its role in the development of atherosclerosis.', 'Peroxiredoxins and Hypoxia-Inducible Factor-1α in Duodenal Tissue: Emerging Factors in the Pathophysiology of Pediatric Celiac Disease Patients.', 'Essential Roles of Peroxiredoxin IV in Inflammation and Cancer.', 'Could a Lower Toll-like Receptor (TLR) and NF-κB Activation Due to a Changed Charge Distribution in the Spike Protein Be the Reason for the Lower Pathogenicity of Omicron?', 'The immunohistochemical detection of peroxiredoxin 1 and 2 in canine spontaneous vascular endothelial tumors.', 'TLR4 Agonist and Hypoxia Synergistically Promote the Formation of TLR4/NF-κB/HIF-1α Loop in Human Epithelial Ovarian Cancer.']"""

Worldwide, an increase in prostate cancer incidence is expected due to an increased life-expectancy, aging of the population and improved diagnosis. Although the specific underlying mechanisms of prostate carcinogenesis remain unknown, prostate cancer is thought to result from a combination of genetic and environmental factors altering key cellular processes. To elucidate these complex interactions and to contribute to the understanding of prostate cancer progression and metastasis, analysis of large scale gene expression studies using bioinformatics approaches is used to decipher regulation of core processes.  Methodology/principal findings:   In this study, a standardized quality control procedure and statistical analysis (http://www.arrayanalysis.org/) were applied to multiple prostate cancer datasets retrieved from the ArrayExpress data repository and pathway analysis using PathVisio (http://www.pathvisio.org/) was performed. The results led to the identification of three core biological processes that are strongly affected during prostate carcinogenesis: cholesterol biosynthesis, the process of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and an increased metabolic activity.  Conclusions:   This study illustrates how a standardized bioinformatics evaluation of existing microarray data and subsequent pathway analysis can quickly and cost-effectively provide essential information about important molecular pathways and cellular processes involved in prostate cancer development and disease progression.

We therefore decided to investigate whether the aberrant transcription factors in both malignancies have some common downstream targets. We crossed a publicly available list of all putative EWSR1-FLI1 target genes in ESFT with our microarray expression data on 24 PCa and 6 non-malignant prostate tissues (NPT) and choose four genes among the top-most differentially expressed between PCa with (PCa ERG+) and without (PCa ETS-) ETS fusion genes (HIST1H4L, KCNN2, ECRG4 and LDOC1), as well as four well-validated direct targets of the EWSR1-FLI1 chimeric protein in ESFT (NR0B1, CAV1, IGFBP3 and TGFBR2). Using quantitative expression analysis in 16 ESFT and seven alveolar rhabdomyosarcomas (ARMS), we were able to validate the four genes previously described as direct targets of the EWSR1-FLI1 oncoprotein, showing overexpression of CAV1 and NR0B1 and underexpression of IGFBP3 and TGFBR2 in ESFT as compared to ARMS. Although none of these four genes showed significant expression differences between PCa ERG+ and PCa ETS-, CAV1, IGFBP3 and TGFBR2 were less expressed in PCa in an independent series of 56 PCa and 15 NPT, as also observed for ECRG4 and LDOC1, suggesting a role in prostate carcinogenesis in general. On the other hand, we demonstrate for the first time that both HIST1H4L and KCNN2 are significantly overexpressed in PCa ERG+ and that ERG binds to the promoter of these genes. Conversely, KCNN2 was found underexpressed in ESFT relative to ARMS, suggesting that the EWSR1-ETS oncoprotein may have the opposite effect of ERG rearrangements in PCa.

Real-time RT-PCR was performed to determine the relative expression of miRNAs, including miR-31-5p, -34c-5p, -96-5p, -182-5p, -183-5p, -205-5p, -221-3p, and -222-3p, which were currently reported to be involved in PC progression.  Results:   In radical prostatectomy samples, relative expression of miR-31-5p, miR-34c-5p, and miR-205-5p in any GP was significantly decreased compared to normal counterpart. However, no significant difference was detected among GP 3, GP 4, and GP 5. Meanwhile, in the same GP4, expression of miR-31-5p miR-182-5p, and miR-205-5p in cancer tissues obtained from high grade cancer was significantly higher than those obtained from intermediate grade cancer. Validation study using biopsy samples revealed that the relative expression of miR-182-5p was statistically higher in high grade cancer even in same GP4.  Conclusions:   We confirmed the expression of miR-182-5p depended on the cancer grade even in same GP 4. Expression of miRNA associated with Gleason grading system may contribute to more accurate preoperative cancer risk evaluation.""","""['Katsuki Tsuchiyama', 'Hideaki Ito', 'Minekatsu Taga', 'Seiji Naganuma', 'Yukinosuke Oshinoya', 'Ken-Ichi Nagano', 'Osamu Yokoyama', 'Hiroshi Itoh']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Regulation of microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) by miR-34c-5p determines the chemosensitivity of gastric cancer to paclitaxel.', 'The expression ratio of miR-17-5p and miR-155 correlates with grading in canine splenic lymphoma.', 'Diagnostic microRNA markers to screen for sporadic human colon cancer in stool: I.

Multiple microorganisms have been implicated in serving as a stimulus for prostatic inflammation. The pro-inflammatory anaerobe, Propionibacterium acnes, is ubiquitously found on human skin and is associated with the skin disease acne vulgaris. Recent studies have shown that P. acnes can be detected in prostatectomy specimens by bacterial culture or by culture-independent molecular techniques.  Methods:   Radical prostatectomy tissue samples were obtained from 30 prostate cancer patients and subject to both aerobic and anaerobic culture. Cultured species were identified by 16S rDNA gene sequencing. Propionibacterium acnes isolates were typed using multilocus sequence typing (MLST).  Results:   Our study confirmed that P. acnes can be readily cultured from prostatectomy tissues (7 of 30 cases, 23%). In some cases, multiple isolates of P. acnes were cultured as well as other Propionibacterium species, such as P. granulosum and P. avidum. Overall, 9 of 30 cases (30%) were positive for Propionibacterium spp. MLST analyses identified eight different sequence types (STs) among prostate-derived P. acnes isolates. These STs belong to two clonal complexes, namely CC36 (type I-2) and CC53/60 (type II), or are CC53/60-related singletons.  Conclusions:   MLST typing results indicated that prostate-derived P. acnes isolates do not fall within the typical skin/acne STs, but rather are characteristic of STs associated with opportunistic infections and/or urethral flora. The MLST typing results argue against the likelihood that prostatectomy-derived P. acnes isolates represent contamination from skin flora.""","""['Tim N Mak', 'Shu-Han Yu', 'Angelo M De Marzo', 'Holger Brüggemann', 'Karen S Sfanos']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Multilocus sequence typing and repetitive-sequence-based PCR (DiversiLab) for molecular epidemiological characterization of Propionibacterium acnes isolates of heterogeneous origin.', 'Propionibacterium acnes associated with inflammation in radical prostatectomy specimens: a possible link to cancer evolution?', 'MALDI-TOF MS fingerprinting facilitates rapid discrimination of phylotypes I, II and III of Propionibacterium acnes.', 'Recent progress in the research about Propionibacterium acnes strain diversity and acne: pathogen or bystander?', 'Propionibacterium acnes: infection beyond the skin.', 'Microbiome and Prostate Cancer: A Novel Target for Prevention and Treatment.', 'Prostate Infiltration by Treg and Th17 Cells as an Immune Response to Propionibacterium acnes Infection in the Course of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia and Prostate Cancer.', 'Differential Microbial Signature Associated With Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia and Prostate Cancer.', 'Bacteria-Mediated Oncogenesis and the Underlying Molecular Intricacies: What We Know So Far.', 'Cutibacterium acnes Phylotype I and II Strains Interact Differently With Human Skin Cells.']"""

Calcium phosphate co-precipitate has been used for nearly 40 years for in vitro transfection due to its non-toxic nature and simplicity of preparation. However, rapid particle growth has largely prevented the translation of this method for in vivo purposes. It has recently been shown that bisphosphonate derivatives can physically stabilize calcium phosphate nanoparticles while still allowing for efficient cell transfection with plasmid DNA. Herein, two novel PEGylated chelating agents (PEG-alendronate and PEG-inositolpentakisphosphate) with enhanced stabilizing properties are introduced, and it is demonstrated that the bisphosphonate-stabilized nanoparticles can efficiently deliver siRNA in vitro. The nanoparticles are mainly taken up by clathrin-dependent endocytosis, and acidification of the endosomal compartment is required to release the entrapped siRNA into the cytosol.

Logistic regression was used to examine the association between race and physical, dental, eye and foot examinations, blood pressure and cholesterol checks, and colon and prostate cancer screenings in men in the Exploring Health Disparities in Integrated Communities in Southwest Baltimore Study. After adjusting for covariates, African American men had greater odds of having had a physical, dental, and eye examination; having had their blood pressure and cholesterol checked; and having been screened for colon and prostate cancer than White men.

Methods:   One thousand and ninety-one consecutive patients scheduled for first ultrasound-guided transrectal prostate biopsy prospectively underwent a 18-core biopsy scheme, including the traditional sextant (6-core), 4 lateral peripheral (10-core), 4 paramedian peripheral (14-core) and additional 4 lateral peripheral cores (18-core).  Results:   The CDR of the 6-, 10-, 14- and 18-core schemes was 33.1, 39.2, 41.6 and 41.8 %, respectively; the difference between the 10- and 6-core scheme reached significance (p < 0.005), whereas that between the 18- or 14- and the 10-core scheme did not. The percentage of tumors diagnosed on the sole basis of the 14-core scheme was significantly greater in patients with low PSA (≤ 7.2 vs. >7.2 ng/ml: 12.1 vs. 1.8 %; p < 0.0001), large prostate volume (≥ 50 vs. <50 cc: 3.4 vs. 9.1 %; p = 0.011) and particularly low PSA density (<0.15 vs. ≥ 0.15: 15.9 vs. 1 %; p < 0.0001). The 18-core scheme did not provide diagnostic advantages in any patients' population.  Conclusions:   The addition of 4 lateral peripheral samples did not increase the CDR of the 10-core biopsy scheme. The addition of four paramedian peripheral samples was beneficial only in patients with PSA density <0.15, in whom the 10-core scheme would have miss almost 16 % of tumors.

Methods and materials:   From May 1989 to January 2011, 1190 Gleason 7 patients with localized prostate cancer were treated with EBRT at a single institution. Of these patients, 613 had a Gleason 7 with a minimum of a sextant biopsy with nonfragmented cores and full biopsy core details available, including number of cores of cancer involved, percentage individual core involvement, location of disease, bilaterality, and presence of perineural invasion. Median follow-up was 6 years (range, 1-16 years). The prognostic implication for the following outcomes was analyzed: biochemical recurrence-free survival (bRFS), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), and prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM).  Results:   The 8-year bRFS rate for pG3 versus pG4 was 77.6% versus 61.3% (P<.0001), DMFS was 96.8% versus 84.3% (P<.0001), and PCSM was 3.7% versus 8.1% (P=.002). On multivariate analysis, pG4 predicted for significantly worse outcome in all parameters. Location of disease (apex, base, mid-gland), perineural involvement, maximum individual core involvement, and the number of Gleason 3+3, 3+4, or 4+3 cores did not predict for distant metastases.

Methods:   Two hundred and thirty patients were enrolled into prospective trials delivering EPNI with a concomitant hypofractionated IMRT boost to the prostate. During accrual, the method of EPNI delivery changed as new literature emerged. Three methods were used (1) 4FB, (2) IMRT with 2cm CTV margins around the pelvic vessels as suggested by Shih et al. (2005) [7] (IMRT-Shih), and (3) IMRT with nodal volumes suggested by the RTOG (IMRT-RTOG). Initially patients were treated with an empty bladder, with the remainder treated with bladder full.  Results:   Patients in the 4FB group had higher rates of grade 2 acute GI toxicities compared to the IMRT-Shih and IMRT-RTOG groups (31.9% vs 20.8% vs 7.2%, p=0.0009). Patients in the 4FB group had higher rates of grade 3 urinary frequency compared to the two IMRT groups (8.5% vs 0% vs 0%, p=0.027). However, multivariate analysis suggested the factor that most influenced toxicity was bladder filling followed by IMRT.

The usefulness of hormonal patterns in PCa diagnosis is controversial. This study aimed to determine the relationship between hormonal patterns and PCa, and to find a cut-off point of hormone levels to assess PCa risk.  Material and methods:   A prospective analysis was undertaken of 279 patients referred for first or second prostate biopsy in the Hospital Clínic Barcelona from November 2006 to May 2009. The indication for prostate biopsy was suspicion of PCa based on the results of digital rectal examination (DRE) and/or elevation of serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA). Screening was carried out with a 5+5-core transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy. Age, prostate volume, DRE (normal or abnormal), biopsy findings (normal or report of PCa), PSA, free-to-total PSA, PSA density, testosterone and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) were also prospectively recorded. Free and bioavailable testosterone were calculated using Vermeulen's formula.  Results:   In the multivariate analysis, abnormal DRE [odds ratio (OR = 5.46, p < 0.001], SHBG levels ≥ 66.25 nmol/l [OR = 3.27; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.52 to 7.04, p < 0.002] and bioavailable testosterone levels ≤ 104 ng/dl (OR = 4.92, 95% CI 1.78 to 13.59, p = 0.002) were related to the diagnosis of prostate adenocarcinoma. Age, free testosterone, PSA, testosterone, PSA/testosterone, PSA/free testosterone and PSA/bioavailable testosterone were not related to PCa diagnosis.  Conclusions:   Low bioavailable testosterone levels and high SHBG levels were related to a 4.9- and 3.2-fold risk of detection of PCa on prostate biopsy owing to PSA elevation or abnormal DRE.

Material and methods:   A prospective consecutive single-institution Danish cohort of 1148 patients undergoing RP between 1995 and 2011 was investigated. To analyse the impact of covariates on risk of PSM, a multivariate logistic regression model was used, including cT category, biopsy Gleason score, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), percentage positive biopsies for cancer (PPB), surgeon and surgical technique.  Results:   The overall rate of PSM was 31.4%. The risk of PSM depended (p value for Wald χ(2)) on PSA (p < 0.0001), PPB (p = 0.003), nerve-sparing surgery (p = 0.03) and the surgeon (p < 0.0001). For every doubling of PSA, the risk of PSM increased by 56%, beginning at 0.5 ng/ml [odds ratio (OR) = 1.56, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.3-1.9, p < 0.01], and every 10% increase in PPB resulted in an 11% increased risk of PSM (OR = 1.11, 95% CI 1.0-1.2, p = 0.002). Two out of the six surgeons had a 50% reduction of risk of PSM compared to the referent surgeon. Nerve-sparing surgery increased the risk of PSM by 50% compared to wide resection (OR = 1.5, 95% CI 1.0-2.1, p = 0.03).  Conclusion:   Both preoperative and surgical parameters affect the risk of PSM after radical prostatectomy. Surgeon and high preoperative PSA, PPB and cT category were confirmed as predictors of PSM. Surprisingly, nerve-sparing surgery was independently associated with increased risk of PSM.

However, since short RNA reads spanning spliced junctions cannot be mapped contiguously onto to the chromosomes, there is a need for methods to profile splicing from RNA-seq data. Before the invent of RNA-seq technologies, microarrays containing probe sequences representing exon-exon junctions of known genes have been used to hybridize cellular RNAs for measuring context-specific differential splicing. Here, we extend this approach to detect tumor-specific splicing in prostate cancer from a RNA-seq dataset.  Method:   A database, SPEventH, representing probe sequences of under a million non-redundant splice events in human is created with exon-exon junctions of optimized length for use as virtual microarray. SPEventH is used to map tens of millions of reads from matched tumor-normal samples from ten individuals with prostate cancer. Differential counts of reads mapped to each event from tumor and matched normal is used to identify statistically significant tumor-specific splice events in prostate.  Results:   We find sixty-one (61) splice events that are differentially expressed with a p-value of less than 0.0001 and a fold change of greater than 1.5 in prostate tumor compared to the respective matched normal samples. Interestingly, the only evidence, EST (BF372485), in the public database for one of the tumor-specific splice event joining one of the intron in KLK3 gene to an intron in KLK2, is also derived from prostate tumor-tissue. Also, the 765 events with a p-value of less than 0.001 is shown to cluster all twenty samples in a context-specific fashion with few exceptions stemming from low coverage of samples.  Conclusions:   We demonstrate that virtual microarray experiments using a non-redundant database of splice events in human is both efficient and sensitive way to profile genome-wide splicing in biological samples and to detect tumor-specific splicing signatures in datasets from RNA-seq technologies. The signature from the large number of splice events that could cluster tumor and matched-normal samples into two tight separate clusters, suggests that differential splicing is yet another RNA phenotype, alongside gene expression and SNPs, that can be exploited for tumor stratification.""","""['Subhashini Srinivasan', 'Arun H Patil', 'Mohit Verma', 'Jonathan L Bingham', 'Raghunathan Srivatsan']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""J Clin Bioinforma""","""['Read-Split-Run: an improved bioinformatics pipeline for identification of genome-wide non-canonical spliced regions using RNA-Seq data.', 'Deep RNA sequencing analysis of readthrough gene fusions in human prostate adenocarcinoma and reference samples.', 'Comparison of RNA-seq and microarray platforms for splice event detection using a cross-platform algorithm.', 'Multiplexed primer extension sequencing: A targeted RNA-seq method that enables high-precision quantitation of mRNA splicing isoforms and rare pre-mRNA splicing intermediates.', 'The analytical landscape of static and temporal dynamics in transcriptome data.']"""

Prostate cancer represents the second leading cause of cancer death in American men. A number of clinical trials involving gene therapy for the treatment of prostate cancer have been reported. The ability to efficiently transduce tumors with effective levels of therapeutic genes has been identified as a fundamental barrier to effective cancer gene therapy. The approach utilizing gene therapy in prostate cancer patients at our institution attempts to address this deficiency. The sodium-iodide symporter (NIS) is responsible for the ability of the thyroid gland to transport and concentrate iodide. The characteristics of the NIS gene suggest that it could represent an ideal therapeutic gene for cancer therapy. Published results from Mayo Clinic researchers have indicated several important successes with the use of the NIS gene and prostate gene therapy. Studies have demonstrated that transfer of the human NIS gene into prostate cancer using adenovirus vectors in vitro and in vivo results in efficient uptake of radioactive iodine and significant tumor growth delay with prolongation of survival. Preclinical successes have culminated in the opening of a phase I trial for patients with advanced prostate disease which is currently accruing patients. Further study will reveal the clinical promise of NIS gene therapy in the treatment of prostate as well as other malignancies.""","""['Kamran A Ahmed', 'Brian J Davis', 'Torrence M Wilson', 'Gregory A Wiseman', 'Mark J Federspiel', 'John C Morris']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Front Oncol""","""['Probasin promoter (ARR(2)PB)-driven, prostate-specific expression of the human sodium iodide symporter (h-NIS) for targeted radioiodine therapy of prostate cancer.', 'Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) promoter-driven androgen-inducible expression of sodium iodide symporter in prostate cancer cell lines.', 'A transporter gene (sodium iodide symporter) for dual purposes in gene therapy: imaging and therapy.', 'Sodium/iodide symporter: a key transport system in thyroid cancer cell metabolism.', 'A probasin promoter, conditionally replicating adenovirus that expresses the sodium iodide symporter (NIS) for radiovirotherapy of prostate cancer.', 'NES1/KLK10 and hNIS gene therapy enhanced iodine-131 internal radiation in PC3 proliferation inhibition.', 'Oncolytic vaccinia virus as a vector for therapeutic sodium iodide symporter gene therapy in prostate cancer.', 'MLF1 interacting protein: a potential gene therapy target for human prostate cancer?', 'Future prospects in the diagnosis and management of localized prostate cancer.']"""
