In this study, we investigated whether downregulation of E-cadherin by E-cadherin-specific small intefering RNA (siRNA) was able to promote malignant phenotypes of prostate cancer cells through upregulating the metastasis-associated gene 1 (MTA1) in vitro. The expression levels of E-cadherin in human paired prostate adenocarcinoma cell lines, PC-3M-2B4 (2B4) and PC-3M-1E8 (1E8), were investigated using western blot analysis. The alteration of malignant phenotypes associated with decreasing E-cadherin expression were assessed in 2B4 cells using wound-healing assays, solid-phase adhesion assays, invasion assays and cytoskeletal staining. The expression of E-cadherin and MTA1 in normal, localized and metastatic prostate cancer cells was analyzed using immunohistochemistry. Downregulation of E-cadherin using an RNA interference approach led to the upregulation of MTA1 expression, decreased tumor cell adhesion ability as well as enhanced cell mobility, invasion and cellular polarity compared with the controls (P<0.05). E-cadherin regulated MTA1 in a time-dependent manner. The correlation between E-cadherin and MTA1 was inversed in the prostate cancer group (P<0.05; r(s)=-0.434). The data suggest that E-cadherin plays an important role in prostate cancer metastasis, which is likely to be due to the regulation of MTA1 expression. E-cadherin may combine with MTA1 and alter the malignant phenotype of prostate cancer cells. A combined testing strategy for detecting MTA1 and E-cadherin may be sufficient for selecting high-risk patients with metastasis. Therefore, E-cadherin and MTA1 may be potential powerful factors for the treatment of various types of cancer.""","""['Liangsheng Fan', 'Hongyan Wang', 'Xi Xia', 'Yumei Rao', 'Xiangyi Ma', 'Ding Ma', 'Peng Wu', 'Gang Chen']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Oncol Lett""","""['Erratum: Loss of E-cadherin promotes prostate cancer metastasis via upregulation of metastasis-associated gene 1 expression.', 'Akt mediates metastasis-associated gene 1 (MTA1) regulating the expression of E-cadherin and promoting the invasiveness of prostate cancer cells.', 'Silencing MTA1 by RNAi reverses adhesion, migration and invasiveness of cervical cancer cells (SiHa) via altered expression of p53, and E-cadherin/β-catenin complex.', 'Metastasis-associated protein\xa01 promotes tumor invasion by downregulation of E-cadherin.', 'Tumor metastasis-associated human MTA1 gene and its MTA1 protein product: role in epithelial cancer cell invasion, proliferation and nuclear regulation.', 'The role of the MTA family and their encoded proteins in human cancers: molecular functions and clinical implications.', 'Modulation of E-Cadherin Function through the AmotL2 Isoforms Promotes Ameboid Cell Invasion.', 'The Role of Cytokines in Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition in Gynaecological Cancers: A Systematic Review.', 'Expression of Concern: Akt Mediates Metastasis-Associated Gene 1 (MTA1) Regulating the Expression of E-cadherin and Promoting the Invasiveness of Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Targeting FHL2-E-cadherin axis by miR-340-5p attenuates colon cancer cell migration and invasion.', 'Metastasis-associated protein 1-mediated antitumor and anticancer activity of dietary stilbenes for prostate cancer chemoprevention and therapy.']"""

Resistance to chemotherapy poses a significant problem for the effective treatment of androgen-independent (hormone-refractory) prostate cancer. Although high concentrations of sodium selenite exert strong anticarcinogenic effects in several cell culture systems and animal models, the therapeutic potential of selenite in patients with advanced or metastatic prostate cancer is extremely limited by the genotoxicity of high-dose selenite. We examined the ability of nontoxic concentrations of selenite to promote apoptosis and inhibit proliferation in carmustine-sensitized androgen-independent human prostate cancer cells. Androgen-dependent LNCaP cells exhibited a significant decrease in cell viability when exposed to nontoxic concentrations of selenite, whereas androgen-independent PC-3 and DU145 cells showed a significant decrease in cell viability only at higher concentrations. Treatment of PC-3 cells with a combination of nontoxic selenite and carmustine resulted in greater increases in cytotoxicity, reactive oxygen species generation, growth inhibition, apoptosis, and DNA double-strand breaks, with concomitant decreases in DNA synthesis, glutathione, glutathione reductase, and antiapoptotic proteins. Combination treatment with carmustine and selenite triggered caspase-dependent apoptosis in PC-3 cells, which was not apparent when these cells were treated with selenite or carmustine alone. Genotoxicity in normal prostate epithelial cells was completely absent in the combination treatment of carmustine and selenite. In addition, carmustine decreased the induction of DNA double strand breaks by high-dose selenite in normal prostate epithelial cells. This is the first study to demonstrate that a nontoxic dose of selenite, in combination with carmustine, significantly induces apoptosis and growth inhibition in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells without causing undesirable genotoxicity in normal prostate epithelial cells, suggesting that this combination therapy may be a promising therapeutic approach in the treatment of patients with metastatic hormone-refractory prostate cancer.""","""['Vijayalakshmi Thamilselvan', 'Mani Menon', 'Sivagnanam Thamilselvan']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Cancer Manag Res""","""['Combination of carmustine and selenite effectively inhibits tumor growth by targeting androgen receptor, androgen receptor-variants, and Akt in preclinical models: New hope for patients with castration resistant prostate cancer.', 'Combination of Carmustine and Selenite Inhibits EGFR Mediated Growth Signaling in Androgen-Independent Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Differential effects of selenium on benign and malignant prostate epithelial cells: stimulation of LNCaP cell growth by noncytotoxic, low selenite concentrations.', 'Differential involvement of reactive oxygen species in apoptosis induced by two classes of selenium compounds in human prostate cancer cells.', 'Selenite-induced p53 Ser-15 phosphorylation and caspase-mediated apoptosis in LNCaP human prostate cancer cells.', 'Exploring targeted therapy of osteosarcoma using proteomics data.', 'Anti-tumor effect of RGD modified PTX loaded liposome on prostatic cancer.', 'Enhanced antitumor effects of low-frequency ultrasound and microbubbles in combination with simvastatin by downregulating caveolin-1 in prostatic DU145 cells.', 'Carmustine-induced phosphatidylserine translocation in the erythrocyte membrane.']"""

Purified active CtsH sequentially cleaved a synthetic peptide representing the N terminus of the talin F0 head domain. The processing of talin by CtsH was determined also in the metastatic PC-3 prostate cancer cell line, which exhibits increased expression of CtsH. The attenuation of CtsH aminopeptidase activity by a specific inhibitor or siRNA-mediated silencing significantly reduced the migration of PC-3 cells on fibronectin and invasion through Matrigel. We found that in migrating PC-3 cells, CtsH was co-localized with talin in the focal adhesions. Furthermore, specific inhibition of CtsH increased the activation of α(v)β(3)-integrin on PC-3 cells.

While CLT1 has no effect on mature, differentiated cells, we show here that CLT1 is highly cytotoxic for a panel of bladder tumor cell lines as well as a variety of cell lines derived from kidney, lung, breast, and prostate cancer. Paralleling our previous results, we found CLT1-induced tumor cell death to be increased in the presence of fibronectin, which mediated CLT1 internalization and subsequent autophagic cell death in a mechanism that depends on tumor cell integrin α5β1 and chloride intracellular channel 3 (CLIC3). This mechanistic link was further supported by our results showing upregulation of α5β1 and CLIC3 in CLT1-responsive tumor cell lines and colocalization with CLT1 in tumor tissues.

The main contributions of our method lie in the following aspects. 1) Instead of using voxel intensity information alone, patch-based representation in the discriminative feature space with logistic sparse LASSO is used as anatomical signature to deal with low contrast problem in prostate CT images. 2) Based on the proposed patch-based signature, a new multi-atlases label fusion method formulated under sparse representation framework is designed to segment prostate in the new treatment images, with guidance from the previous segmented images of the same patient. This method estimates the prostate likelihood of each voxel in the new treatment image from its nearby candidate voxels in the previous segmented images, based on the nonlocal mean principle and sparsity constraint. 3) A hierarchical labeling strategy is further designed to perform label fusion, where voxels with high confidence are first labeled for providing useful context information in the same image for aiding the labeling of the remaining voxels. 4) An online update mechanism is finally adopted to progressively collect more patient-specific information from newly segmented treatment images of the same patient, for adaptive and more accurate segmentation. The proposed method has been extensively evaluated on a prostate CT image database consisting of 24 patients where each patient has more than 10 treatment images, and further compared with several state-of-the-art prostate CT segmentation algorithms using various evaluation metrics.

Higher grade tumors eventually emerge in 20% to 30% of these cases, but this process may only reflect incomplete sampling on the initial biopsy, such that it remains unknown whether G3 tumors generally progress to higher grades. In this study, we examined a series of adjacent G3 and Gleason pattern 4 (G4) tumors in radical prostatectomy specimens and found that all were concordant for the TMPRSS2:ERG gene fusion. Using hybrid-capture and deep sequencing in four fusion-positive cases, we found that adjacent laser-capture microdissected G3 and G4 tumors had identical TMPRSS2:ERG fusion breakpoints, confirming their clonal origin. Two of these G3 tumors had deletion of a single PTEN gene that was also deleted in the adjacent G4, while the G4 tumors in two cases had additional PTEN losses. These findings establish that a subset of G3 tumors progress to G4 or emerge from a common precursor.

In this study, we describe a novel mechanism of antiapoptosis by NF-κB, revealing that it can block PAR-4-mediated apoptosis by downregulating trafficking of the PAR-4 receptor GRP78 from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cell surface. Mechanistic investigations revealed that NF-κB mediated this antiapoptotic mechanism by upregulating expression of UACA, a proinflammatory protein in certain disease settings. In clinical specimens of cancer, a strong correlation existed between NF-κB activity and UACA expression, relative to normal tissues. UACA bound to intracellular PAR-4 in diverse cancer cells, where it prevented translocation of GRP78 from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cell surface. This pathway of antiapoptosis could be inhibited by suppressing levels of NF-κB or UACA expression, which enhanced endoplasmic reticulum stress and restored GRP78 trafficking to the cell surface, thereby sensitizing cancer cells to apoptosis by extracellular PAR-4 or GRP78 agonistic antibody. In summary, our results identify a novel intracellular pathway of apoptosis mediated by NF-κB through UACA elevation, which by attenuating endoplasmic reticulum stress and GRP78 translocation to the cell surface can blunt the sensitivity of cancer cells to apoptosis.""","""['Ravshan Burikhanov', 'Tripti Shrestha-Bhattarai', 'Shirley Qiu', 'Nidhi Shukla', 'Nikhil Hebbar', 'Subodh M Lele', 'Craig Horbinski', 'Vivek M Rangnekar']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Cancer Res""","""['Role of prostate apoptosis response 4 in translocation of GRP78 from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cell surface of trophoblastic cells.', 'The Role of Prostate Apoptosis Response-4 (Par-4) in Mycobacterium tuberculosis Infected Macrophages.', 'The tumor suppressor Par-4 activates an extrinsic pathway for apoptosis.', 'Cancer-selective apoptosis by tumor suppressor par-4.', 'Cancer-selective apoptotic effects of extracellular and intracellular Par-4.', 'Crizotinib induces Par-4 secretion from normal cells and GRP78 expression on the cancer cell surface for selective tumor growth inhibition.', 'Prostate Apoptosis Response-4 (Par-4): A Novel Target in Pyronaridine-Induced Apoptosis in Glioblastoma (GBM) Cells.', 'Shedding Light on NF-κB Functions in Cellular Organelles.', 'ST08 Altered NF-κB Pathway in Breast Cancer Cells In Vitro as Revealed by miRNA-mRNA Analysis and Enhanced the Effect of Cisplatin on Tumour Reduction in EAC Mouse Model.', 'UACA locus is associated with breast cancer chemoresistance and survival.']"""

Methods:   Radical cystectomy was performed on 140 male patients (all cases body mass index >28 kg/m(2), 29 cases having undergone partial cystectomy) with bladder cancer. With the aid of the double-slice retractor to expose vascular pedicles from the bladder and prostate, 80 radical cystectomies were performed. The others were treated as the control.  Results:   The double-slice retractor provided excellent exposure for the division of vascular pedicles from the bladder and prostate. The handling of the vascular pedicles from the bladder and prostate became easier and safer without unnecessary bleeding and injury in the rectum. In double-slice retractor and control groups, the operative time to handle the vascular pedicles during radical cystectomy in the double-slice retractor group was 12.2 ± 1.4 min compared with 22.6 ± 3.4 min for the control group (P < 0.05), and the blood loss was 30.3 ± 2.2 ml compared with 50.2 ± 4.5 ml (P < 0.05).

Here, we describe the initial clinical experience and radiation dosimetry of (18)F-DCFBC in men with metastatic PCa.  Methods:   Five patients with radiologic evidence of metastatic PCa were studied after the intravenous administration of 370 MBq (10 mCi) of (18)F-DCFBC. Serial PET was performed until 2 h after administration. Time-activity curves were generated for selected normal tissues and metastatic foci. Radiation dose estimates were calculated using OLINDA/EXM 1.1.  Results:   Most vascular organs demonstrated a slow decrease in radioactivity concentration over time consistent with clearance from the blood pool, with primarily urinary radiotracer excretion. Thirty-two PET-positive suspected metastatic sites were identified, with 21 concordant on both PET and conventional imaging for abnormal findings compatible with metastatic disease. Of the 11 PET-positive sites not identified on conventional imaging, most were within the bone and could be considered suggestive for the detection of early bone metastases, although further validation is needed. The highest mean absorbed dose per unit administered radioactivity (μGy/MBq) was in the bladder wall (32.4), and the resultant effective dose was 19.9 ± 1.34 μSv/MBq (mean ± SD).

However, the mechanisms of action underlying the compound's anticancer activity have not been fully elucidated. In this study, the apoptotic effects of DADS were investigated in DU145 human prostate carcinoma cells. Our results showed that DADS markedly inhibited the growth of the DU145 cells by induction of apoptosis. Apoptosis was accompanied by modulation of Bcl-2 and inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) family proteins, depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP, &#916;&#936;m) and proteolytic activation of caspases. We also found that the expression of death-receptor 4 (DR4) and Fas ligand (FasL) proteins was increased and that the level of intact Bid proteins was down-regulated by DADS. Moreover, treatment with DADS induced phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), including extracellular-signal regulating kinase (ERK), p38 MAPK and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). A specific JNK inhibitor, SP600125, significantly blocked DADS-induced-apoptosis, whereas inhibitors of the ERK (PD98059) and p38 MAPK (SB203580) had no effect. The induction of apoptosis was also accompanied by inactivation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt and the PI3K inhibitor LY29004 significantly increased DADS-induced cell death.

Pharmacokinetic models are generally used to extract hemodynamic parameters, providing a quantitative description of the contrast uptake and wash-out. Empirical functions can also be used to fit experimental data without the need of any assumption about tumour physiology, as in pharmacokinetic models, increasing their diagnostic utility, in particular when automatic diagnosis systems are implemented on the basis of an MRI multi-parametric approach. Phenomenological universalities (PUN) represent a novel tool for experimental research and offer a simple and systematic method to represent a set of data independent of the application field. DCE-MRI acquisitions can thus be advantageously evaluated by the extended PUN class, providing a convenient diagnostic tool to analyse functional studies, adding a new set of features for the classification of malignant and benign lesions in computer aided detection systems. In this work the Tofts pharmacokinetic model and the class EU1 generated by the PUN description were compared in the study of DCE-MRI of the prostate, evaluating complexity of model implementation, goodness of fitting results, classification performances and computational cost. The mean R² obtained with the EU1 and Tofts model were equal to 0.96 and 0.90, respectively, and the classification performances achieved by the EU1 model and the Tofts implementation discriminated malignant from benign tissues with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve equal to 0.92 and 0.91, respectively. Furthermore, the EU1 model has a simpler functional form which reduces implementation complexity and computational time, requiring 6 min to complete a patient elaboration process, instead of 8 min needed for the Tofts model analysis.""","""['S Mazzetti', 'A S Gliozzi', 'C Bracco', 'F Russo', 'D Regge', 'M Stasi']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced MRI in the Study of Brain Tumors.

Supplementation with selenium in the form of selenized yeast (Se-yeast) significantly reduced prostate cancer incidence in the Nutritional Prevention of Cancer Trial. Conversely, the Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT) showed no such cancer-protective advantage using selenomethionine (SeMet). The possibility that SeMet and Se-yeast are not equipotent in promoting homeostasis and cancer risk reduction in the aging prostate has not been adequately investigated; no direct comparison has ever been reported in man or animals. Here, we analyzed data on prostatic responses to SeMet or Se-yeast from a controlled feeding trial of 49 elderly beagle dogs-the only non-human species to frequently develop prostate cancer during aging-randomized to one of five groups: control; low-dose SeMet, low-dose Se-yeast (3 μg/kg); high-dose SeMet, high-dose Se-yeast (6 μg/kg). After seven months of supplementation, we found no significant selenium form-dependent differences in toenail or intraprostatic selenium concentration. Next, we determined whether SeMet or Se-yeast acts with different potency on six markers of prostatic homeostasis that likely contribute to prostate cancer risk reduction-intraprostatic dihydrotestosterone (DHT), testosterone (T), DHT:T, and epithelial cell DNA damage, proliferation, and apoptosis. By analyzing dogs supplemented with SeMet or Se-yeast that achieved equivalent intraprostatic selenium concentration after supplementation, we showed no significant differences in potency of either selenium form on any of the six parameters over three different ranges of target tissue selenium concentration. Our findings, which represent the first direct comparison of SeMet and Se-yeast on a suite of readouts in the aging prostate that reflect flux through multiple gene networks, do not further support the notion that the null results of SELECT are attributable to differences in prostatic consequences achievable through daily supplementation with SeMet, rather than Se-yeast.""","""['David J Waters', 'Shuren Shen', 'Seema S Kengeri', 'Emily C Chiang', 'Gerald F Combs Jr', 'J Steven Morris', 'David G Bostwick']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Nutrients""","""['Targeted Metabolomics Analysis Reveals that Dietary Supranutritional Selenium Regulates Sugar and Acylcarnitine Metabolism Homeostasis in Pig Liver.', 'Selenium accumulation in prostate tissue during a randomized, controlled short-term trial of l-selenomethionine: a Southwest Oncology Group Study.', 'Application of isotope dilution analysis for the evaluation of extraction conditions in the determination of total selenium and selenomethionine in yeast-based nutritional supplements.', 'The nutritional significance, metabolism and toxicology of selenomethionine.', 'Five threads: How U-shaped thinking weaves together dogs, men, selenium, and prostate cancer risk.', 'Selenium and Dogs: A Systematic Review.', 'Selenium in Poultry Nutrition: from Sodium Selenite to Organic Selenium Sources.', 'Evaluating the probiotic and therapeutic potentials of Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain (OBS2) isolated from fermented nectar of toddy palm.', 'Selenium in pig nutrition and reproduction: boars and semen quality-a review.', 'Comparative effects of two different forms of selenium on oxidative stress biomarkers in healthy men: a randomized clinical trial.']"""

However, the precise mechanism underlying how indolent tumours with PTEN alterations acquire metastatic potential remains poorly understood. Recent studies suggest that upregulation of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β signalling triggered by PTEN loss will form a growth barrier as a defence mechanism to constrain prostate cancer progression, underscoring that TGF-β signalling might represent a pre-invasive checkpoint to prevent PTEN-mediated prostate tumorigenesis. Here we show that COUP transcription factor II (COUP-TFII, also known as NR2F2), a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, serves as a key regulator to inhibit SMAD4-dependent transcription, and consequently overrides the TGF-β-dependent checkpoint for PTEN-null indolent tumours. Overexpression of COUP-TFII in the mouse prostate epithelium cooperates with PTEN deletion to augment malignant progression and produce an aggressive metastasis-prone tumour. The functional counteraction between COUP-TFII and SMAD4 is reinforced by genetically engineered mouse models in which conditional loss of SMAD4 diminishes the inhibitory effects elicited by COUP-TFII ablation. The biological significance of COUP-TFII in prostate carcinogenesis is substantiated by patient sample analysis, in which COUP-TFII expression or activity is tightly correlated with tumour recurrence and disease progression, whereas it is inversely associated with TGF-β signalling. These findings reveal that the destruction of the TGF-β-dependent barrier by COUP-TFII is crucial for the progression of PTEN-mutant prostate cancer into a life-threatening disease, and supports COUP-TFII as a potential drug target for the intervention of metastatic human prostate cancer.""","""['Jun Qin', 'San-Pin Wu', 'Chad J Creighton', 'Fangyan Dai', 'Xin Xie', 'Chiang-Min Cheng', 'Anna Frolov', 'Gustavo Ayala', 'Xia Lin', 'Xin-Hua Feng', 'Michael M Ittmann', 'Shaw-Jenq Tsai', 'Ming-Jer Tsai', 'Sophia Y Tsai']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Nature""","""['Cell signalling: Breaking down the defenses.', 'SMAD4-dependent barrier constrains prostate cancer growth and metastatic progression.', 'MPC1, a key gene in cancer metabolism, is regulated by COUPTFII in human prostate cancer.', 'COUP-TFII, a prognostic marker and therapeutic target for prostate cancer.', 'The role of the orphan nuclear receptor COUP-TFII in tumorigenesis.', 'Multiple roles of COUP-TFII in cancer initiation and progression.', 'GATA2 co-opts TGFβ1/SMAD4 oncogenic signaling and inherited variants at 6q22 to modulate prostate cancer progression.', 'Reduced NR2F2 Expression in the Host Response to Infectious Bursal Disease Virus Infection Suppressed Viral Replication by Enhancing Type I Interferon Expression by Targeting SOCS5.', 'An epigenetic switch controls an alternative NR2F2 isoform that unleashes a metastatic program in melanoma.', 'SERPINF1 Mediates Tumor Progression and Stemness in Glioma.', 'ARID1A loss induces polymorphonuclear myeloid-derived suppressor cell chemotaxis and promotes prostate cancer progression.']"""

Objective:   To evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic value of Progensa PCA3 and TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusions (as individual biomarkers and as a panel) for PCa in a prospective multicentre setting.  Design, setting, and participants:   At six centres, post-digital rectal examination first-catch urine specimens prior to prostate biopsies were prospectively collected from 497 men. We assessed the predictive value of Progensa PCA3 and TMPRSS2-ERG (quantitative nucleic acid amplification assay to detect TMPRSS2-ERG messenger RNA [mRNA]) for PCa, Gleason score, clinical tumour stage, and PCa significance (individually and as a marker panel). This was compared with serum prostate-specific antigen and the European Randomised Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) risk calculator. In a subgroup (n=61) we evaluated biomarker association with prostatectomy outcome.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis and receiver operating curves were used.  Results and limitations:   Urine samples of 443 men contained sufficient mRNA for marker analysis. PCa was diagnosed in 196 of 443 men. Both PCA3 and TMPRSS2-ERG had significant additional predictive value to the ERSPC risk calculator parameters in multivariate analysis (p<0.001 and resp. p=0.002). The area under the curve (AUC) increased from 0.799 (ERSPC risk calculator), to 0.833 (ERSPC risk calculator plus PCA3), to 0.842 (ERSPC risk calculator plus PCA3 plus TMPRSS2-ERG) to predict PCa. Sensitivity of PCA3 increased from 68% to 76% when combined with TMPRSS2-ERG. TMPRSS2-ERG added significant predictive value to the ERSPC risk calculator to predict biopsy Gleason score (p<0.001) and clinical tumour stage (p=0.023), whereas PCA3 did not.  Conclusions:   TMPRSS2-ERG had independent additional predictive value to PCA3 and the ERSPC risk calculator parameters for predicting PCa. TMPRSS2-ERG had prognostic value, whereas PCA3 did not.

Dose on the subsequent images is evaluated in two ways: (A1) Dose is recalculated on each image. (A2) The initially planned dose distribution is copied to each image. A2 assumes dose-invariance in the accelerator-coordinate-system. Effects of patient miss-alignment are simulated by 27 per-patient image shifts; 0 and ±10 mm in left-right, anterior-posterior and superior-inferior directions. The per-voxel dose differences for each patient image, total accumulated patient dose, and dose-volume metrics (CTV-D98 and -D90, bladder- and rectum-D50, -D35, -D25 and -D15) are used to compare A1 and A2.  Results:   The per-voxel mean percent difference in A1 and A2 dose over all patient images at 6 MV is (0.01±1.56)% and at 18 MV is (0.00±0.96)%.

Emerging evidence shows that it requires interplays between cancer cells and micro-environmental biofactors. Indoleamine 3,5-dioxygenase-1 (IDO-1) produced by cancer, local lymph nodes, and satellite cells have been demonstrated as one of the biofactors. Aberrant IDO-1 activity has partially contributed to immunosuppressive environment by repressing T lymphocyte and natural killer cell activities, and activating regulatory T cells (Treg, CD4+CD25+). Clinical investigations further show a negative correlation between the enzyme activity and prognosis in patients with various cancer types. The findings suggest a possible role of IDO-1 inhibitor in restoring host anti-tumor immunity and attenuating cancer metastasis. Data from preclinical and phase I/II clinical studies with IDO-1 inhibitors support this hypothesis. Polyphenols as antioxidants are shown to exhibit anticancer activities. However, the underlying mechanism has not been entirely characterized. We recently found that certain flavone molecules profoundly inhibit the enzymatic activity of IDO-1 but not mRNA expression in human neuronal stem cells (hNSC) confirmed by cell-based assay and qRT-PCR. To further the investigation, we studied additional anti-cancer phytochemicals including chalcone, flavonol, isoflavone, and diterpene. Here we summarize the results and show that the inhibitory sensitivity depends on the molecular structure in the following order: apigenin > wogonin > chrysin > biacalein ~ genistein > quercetin. Curcumin and isoliquiritigenin (a chalcone) exhibited toxicity to hNSCs. Although oridonin (a diterpene) showed a null toxicity toward hNSCs, it repressed the enzymatic function only marginally in contrast to its potent cytotoxicity in various cancer cell lines. While the mode of action of the enzyme-polyphenol complex awaits to be investigated, the sensitivity of enzyme inhibition was compared to the anti-proliferative activities toward three cancer cell lines. The IC50s obtained from both sets of the experiments indicate that they are in the vicinity of micromolar concentration with the enzyme inhibition slightly more active. These results suggest that attenuation of immune suppression via inhibition of IDO-1 enzyme activity may be one of the important mechanisms of polyphenols in chemoprevention or combinatorial cancer therapy.""","""['Sophie S Chen', 'Randolph Corteling', 'Lara Stevanato', 'John Sinden']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Discov Med""","""['Natural inhibitors of indoleamine 3,5-dioxygenase induced by interferon-gamma in human neural stem cells.', 'Plant polyphenol induced cell death in human cancer cells involves mobilization of intracellular copper ions and reactive oxygen species generation: a mechanism for cancer chemopreventive action.', 'Discovery of Indoleamine 2,3-Dioxygenase 1 (IDO-1) Inhibitors Based on Ortho-Naphthaquinone-Containing Natural Product.', 'Site-specific anticancer effects of dietary flavonoid quercetin.', 'Dietary polyphenols in chemoprevention and synergistic effect in cancer: Clinical evidences and molecular mechanisms of action.', 'Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi and Their Natural Flavonoid Compounds in the Treatment of Ovarian Cancer: A Review.', 'Stability and anti-proliferative properties of biologically active compounds extracted from Cistus L. after sterilization treatments.', 'The Gut Microbiota Links Dietary Polyphenols With Management of Psychiatric Mood Disorders.', 'Apigenin inhibits TNFα/IL-1α-induced CCL2 release through IKBK-epsilon signaling in MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells.', 'Nanomedicine and cancer immunotherapy: focus on indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase inhibitors.']"""

However, its strongly hydrophobic nature causes aggregation of the molecules and prevents its unbiased bioavailability in the biological media, resulting in lower accumulation in the tumor cells. Several strategies have been adopted to improve the photodynamic characteristics of the photosensitizer. Among them, very promising seems to be the encapsulation of the molecule into liposomes, due to the superior properties of liposomes as drug carriers.  Methods:   In this paper the photodynamic characteristics of the PEGylated liposomal formulation of m-THPC, Fospeg, using the human prostate cancer cell line LNCaP, as an in vitro model, were investigated. In addition the spectral characteristics, cellular uptake and localization, dark and light induced cytotoxicity and photodynamic efficacy of Foscan(®) and Fospeg were compared.  Results:   Fospeg, compared with Foscan, showed higher intracellular uptake at any concentration and incubation time. Regarding PDT efficacy, Fospeg produced more severe cytotoxicity than Foscan(®) at any concentration and energy dose. Using Fospeg, the lowest concentration (0.22 μM) and energy dose (180 mJ/cm(2)) was adequate to result in the death of 50% of the cells 24h post PDT while an approximately 10 times higher Foscan(®) concentration (1.8 μM) was needed to result in the same cytotoxicity.  Conclusions:   The use of the PEGylated liposomal formulation of m-THPC resulted in the improvement of its intracellular uptake and the enhancement of its photodynamic activity. Fospeg, compared to Foscan(®), proved to be a more advantageous photosensitizer for photodynamic therapy.""","""['Aspasia Petri', 'Dido Yova', 'Eleni Alexandratou', 'Maria Kyriazi', 'Michail Rallis']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Photodiagnosis Photodyn Ther""","""['Photochemical internalization (PCI)-mediated enhancement of bleomycin cytotoxicity by liposomal mTHPC formulations in human head and neck cancer cells.', 'Improved in vivo delivery of m-THPC via pegylated liposomes for use in photodynamic therapy.', 'Uptake and photo-toxicity of Foscan®, Foslip® and Fospeg® in multicellular tumor spheroids.', 'mTHPC--a drug on its way from second to third generation photosensitizer?', 'Temoporfin (Foscan®, 5,10,15,20-tetra(m-hydroxyphenyl)chlorin)--a second-generation photosensitizer.', 'Establishing a Robust and Reliable Response from a Potent Osmium-Based Photosensitizer Via Lipid Nanoformulation†.', 'Implications of photodynamic cancer therapy: an overview of PDT mechanisms basically and practically.', 'Prospects for More Efficient Multi-Photon Absorption Photosensitizers Exhibiting Both Reactive Oxygen Species Generation and Luminescence.', 'Porphyrin photosensitizers in photodynamic therapy and its applications.', 'Photosensitizers in prostate cancer therapy.']"""

Using our laboratory newly identified peptide TMTP1 and diphtheria toxin, we developed a new fusion protein that showed remarkable ability to target highly metastatic tumors. Fusion protein toxins were generated by fusing the first 390 amino acids of diphtheria toxin [truncated diphtheria toxin (DT390)] to different repeats of peptide TMTP1 (DT390-TMTP1, DT390-biTMTP1, and DT390-triTMTP1). Efficacies of the recombinant fusion proteins on tumor growth and metastasis were evaluated in vitro and in vivo. DT390-triTMTP1 showed the most powerful toxicity against cancer, which led to tumor growth retardation or regression and prolonged survival of human prostate cancer PC-3M-1E8 subcutaneously bearing or gastric cancer MKN-45 orthotopic nude mice. Increased TUNEL and caspase-3 staining and reduced ki67 staining in tumor cells suggested that the anticancer effects of DT390-triTMTP1 were through selectively inducing apoptosis and inhibiting proliferation of cancer cells.

Adrenal androgens can be metabolized by prostate cancer cells, which is one of the mechanisms associated with progression to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Aldo-keto reductase family 1 member C3 (AKR1C3) is a steroidogenic enzyme that plays a crucial role in the conversion of adrenal androgen dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) into high-affinity ligands for the androgen receptor (testosterone [T] and dihydrotestosterone [DHT]). The aim of this study was to examine whether AKR1C3 could be used as a marker and therapeutic target for CRPC. AKR1C3 mRNA and protein levels were upregulated in CRPC tissue, compared with benign prostate and primary prostate cancer tissue. High AKR1C3 levels were found only in a subset of CRPC patients. AKR1C3 can be used as a biomarker for active intratumoral steroidogenesis and can be measured in biopsy or transurethral resection of the prostate specimens. DuCaP (a CRPC cell line that has high AKR1C3 expression levels) used and converted DHEA under hormone-depleted conditions into T and DHT. The DHEA-induced growth of DuCaP could be antagonized by indomethacine, an inhibitor of AKR1C3.

Although commonly associated with pregnancy (when it is known as linea gravidarum), it has been found in normal male and female individuals, particularly in the younger age group where estrogen or lack of sensitivity of androgen receptors has been suggested as a possible factor. From a previous study the incidence of LN varied in different genders, age groups, and certain clinical status such as pregnancy and, in men, benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH)/prostate carcinoma (PC).  Objective:   The need to get a clinical feature that can aid diagnosis of PC, the commonest male neoplasm in Nigeria, at an affordable cost prompted us to look at the incidence of LN in three male populations (i.e., one with BPH, one with PC, and a control population unaffected by these two conditions). Gynecomastia and female hair distribution, two features considered hormone related were looked for additionally in the study population. The study was carried out in a teaching hospital in Ibadan, southwestern Nigeria.  Results:   LN was found in 48% of PC, 26% of BPH, and 8% of controls. Female pubic hair was found in 48% of PC, 26% of BPH, and 12% of controls. Gynecomastia was found in 36% of PC, 12% of BPH, and 0% of controls. Differences between patients with BPH, PC, and controls regarding incidence of LN and female pubic hair were deemed explicable by chance (P = 0.17, Fisher exact test). Differences between PC and BPH patients with respect to gynecomastia were deemed inexplicable by chance (P = 0.008, Fisher exact test).  Conclusion:   LN alone cannot be used to differentiate PC and BPH.

Differences should be considered to ensure generalizability of trial results and equality of access.  Methods:   Phase I trials unit referrals at our center over 5 years, from 2007 to 2012, were reviewed. Socioeconomic status was defined by the Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD; 1, least deprived; 5, most deprived). Multivariate analysis was performed comparing incident cancer cases with referred patients and those ultimately enrolled onto a trial.  Results:   Four hundred thirty patients were referred (median age, 62 years). Compared with 10,784 incident cases, referral was less likely for patients in the more-deprived quintiles compared with the least deprived (IMD 5: odds ratio [OR], 0.53; 95% CI, 0.38 to 0.74). Once reviewed in the unit, enrollment onto a trial was not affected (IMD 5: OR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.40 to 1.63). Ethnicity analysis showed the nonwhite population was less likely to be recruited (OR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.26 to 0.88). This relationship was lost with adjustment for age, sex, cancer type, and deprivation index.  Conclusion:   We show for the first time to our knowledge that socioeconomic status affects early-phase cancer trial referrals. The least-deprived patients are almost twice as likely to be referred compared with the most deprived. This may be because more-deprived patients are less suitable for a trial-as a result of comorbidities, for example-or because of inequalities that could be addressed by patient or referrer education. Once reviewed at the unit, enrollment onto a trial is not affected by deprivation.""","""['Aisyah Mohd Noor', 'Debashis Sarker', 'Suzanne Vizor', 'Blair McLennan', 'Sarah Hunter', 'Aneta Suder', 'Henrik Moller', 'James F Spicer', 'Sophie Papa']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Clin Oncol""","""['Culture matters as well.', 'Reply to A.

The prostate health index (Phi), a measure based on p2PSA and calculated as p2PSA/fPSA × √tPSA, was evaluated in a multicenter study for detecting PCa.  Methods:   A total of 1362 patients from 4 different study sites who had tPSA values of 1.6-8.0 μg/L (668 patients with PCa, 694 without PCa) underwent ≥10 core biopsies. Serum concentrations of tPSA, fPSA (both calibrated against a WHO reference material), and p2PSA were measured on Access2 or DxI800 analyzers (Beckman Coulter).  Results:   The percentage ratio of p2PSA to fPSA (%p2PSA) and Phi were significantly higher in all PCa subcohorts (positive initial or repeat biopsy result or negative digital rectal examination) (P < 0.0001) compared with patients without PCa. Phi had the largest area under the ROC curve (AUC) (AUC = 0.74) and provided significantly better clinical performance for predicting PCa compared with %p2PSA (AUC = 0.72, P = 0.018), p2PSA (AUC = 0.63, P < 0.0001), %fPSA (AUC = 0.61) or tPSA (AUC = 0.56).

Results:   Of 246 enrolled men, prostate cancer (PCa) was diagnosed in 110 (45%) and there was no evidence of malignancy (NEM) in 136 (55%). A first set of biopsies was performed in 136 (55%) of all men, and 110 (45%) had ≥1 repeat biopsies. PCA3, Phi, and T2:ERG differed significantly between men with PCa and NEM, and these markers showed the largest areas under the ROC curve (AUCs) (0.74, 0.68, and 0.63, respectively). PCA3 had the largest AUC of all parameters, albeit not statistically different from Phi. Phi showed somewhat lower specificities than PCA3 at 90% sensitivity. Combination of both markers enhanced diagnostic power with modest AUC gains of 0.01-0.04. Although PCA3 had the highest AUC in the repeat-biopsy cohort, the highest AUC for Phi was observed in DRE-negative patients with PSA in the 2-10 μg/L range.

Male TRAMP mice, beginning at 4 weeks of age, were fed with 1%, 2%, or 4% (w/v) IP6 in drinking water or only drinking water till 28 weeks of age and monitored using MRI over the course of study. Longitudinal assessment of prostate volumes by conventional MRI and tumor vascularity by gadolinium-based DCE-MRI showed a profound reduction in tumor size, partly due to antiangiogenic effects by IP6 treatment. As potential mechanisms of IP6 efficacy, decrease in the expression of glucose transporter GLUT-4 protein together with an increase in levels of phospho-AMP-activated kinase (AMPK(Th172)) were observed in prostate tissues of mice from IP6 fed-groups, suggesting that IP6 is interfering with the metabolic events occurring in TRAMP prostate. Investigative metabolomics study using quantitative high-resolution (1)H-NMR on prostate tissue extracts showed that IP6 significantly decreased glucose metabolism and membrane phospholipid synthesis, in addition to causing an increase in myoinositol levels in the prostate. Together, these findings show that oral IP6 supplement blocks growth and angiogenesis of prostate cancer in the TRAMP model in conjunction with metabolic events involved in tumor sustenance.

Direct injections have been used to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia without major complications, but in limited cases. We evaluated the local oncotoxic effects of acetic acid in a prostate cancer xenograft murine model.  Materials and methods:   PC3 and LNCaP human prostate cancer cell lines were used to grow subcutaneous tumors in SCID mice. For each cell line, 14 mice underwent intratumor injection with 25% acetic acid (0.05 ml/100 cm3 of tumor) after the tumor was >300 mm3. Post-treatment one mouse/group was euthanized after 2 h, 24 h, 1 and 2 weeks; remaining mice (n = 10) were killed at 120 days. Control mice (8/group) were euthanized after they met the humane criteria for tumor burden and overall health.  Results:   Tumor necrosis was noted immediately post-injection; by 24 h, ulceration and crusting of overlying skin were noted, which healed into scars by 23 ± 5 days. Histological examination showed tumor degeneration and necrosis with blood vessel obstruction. Ten treated mice in both groups survived for 120 days, which was much longer than the mean survival of PC3 (40 ± 9 days) and LNCaP (56 ± 10) control mice.  Conclusions:   Direct injection of acetic acid successfully eradicated both tumors. This treatment option could potentially be used in humans for treatment of early localized prostate cancer and nonoperative management of locally advanced cases. This is the first report of successful local chemical therapy for prostate cancer.""","""['Jasneet Singh Bhullar', 'Gokulakkrishna Subhas', 'Sushant Chaudhary', 'Boris Silberberg', 'Jacqueline Tilak', 'Milessa Decker', 'Vijay K Mittal']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""World J Urol""","""['Severe combined immunodeficient-hu model of human prostate cancer metastasis to human bone.', 'The suppression of human prostate tumor growth in mice by the intratumoral injection of a slow-release polymeric paste formulation of paclitaxel.', 'Intratumor injection of the Hsp90 inhibitor 17AAG decreases tumor growth and induces apoptosis in a prostate cancer xenograft model.', 'Effects of direct injection of dehydrated ethanol on PC3 human prostate cancer cells in nude mice: preliminary study.', 'Osteoprotegerin/osteoclastogenesis inhibitory factor decreases human prostate cancer burden in human adult bone implanted into nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient mice.', 'Multifunctional Liposomes for Image-Guided Intratumoral Chemo-Phototherapy.', 'A novel in situ permeation system and its utility in cancer tissue ablation.']"""

Patients and methods:   Two hundred and forty-three consecutive patients with a PSA level less than 10 ng/ml and a DRE without anomaly had PDS-guided biopsies: 12 to 15 samples were systematically taken and echo-guided in the suspect areas. The PDS results were rated from 1 to 4: 1: normal, 2: slightly hypoechogenic avascular area in which the hypo-echogenicity disappears after compression by probe, 3: hypoechogenic avascular area, 4: hypoechogenic vascularised area with power Doppler sonography. Patients rated 3 or 4 were considered to be pathological. D'Amico's criteria were used to assess the risk of a biological recurrence after treatment and those of Dall'Era were used to select the patients that could benefit from active surveillance (AS). The PDS was considered to be a true positive if at least one biopsy was positive in the same sextant as the suspect image.  Results:   In a prospective manner, 106 cancers were diagnosed that could be qualified as low-risk in 84% of the cases (89% with a normal PDS and 79% with an abnormal PDS). Sixty-nine percent of the cases could be subject to AS (86% of the normal PDS cases and 47% of the abnormal PDS cases; P<0.001). The PDS was normal in 159 of the 243 patients (65%). With a normal PDS, there was a 96% probability of not having a high-risk cancer. With an abnormal PDS, at least one biopsy was positive in 57% of the cases and the probability of having a significant cancer was 30% according to the Dall'Era criteria. A significant reduction was noted with a normal PDS, to 36% and 5%, respectively (VPN=95%) (P=0.015).  Conclusion:   A normal PDS in patients presenting a PSA level less than 10 ng/ml and a DRE without anomaly may be used to put off the indication for a biopsy in order to reduce their number as well as the risks of overtreatment for a latent cancer.""","""['J-L Sauvain', 'E Sauvain', 'P Rohmer', 'D Louis', 'N Nader', 'R Papavero', 'J-M Bremon', 'J Jehl']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Diagn Interv Imaging""","""['Limiting overdiagnosis of low-risk prostate cancer through an evaluation of the predictive value of transrectal and power Doppler ultrasonography.', 'Value of power doppler and 3D vascular sonography as a method for diagnosis and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Power Doppler Imaging and prostate cancer: optional or necessary technique?.', 'Value of power Doppler sonography with 3D reconstruction in preoperative diagnostics of extraprostatic tumor extension in clinically localized prostate cancer.', 'Detection of prostate cancer with three-dimensional transrectal ultrasound: correlation with biopsy results.', 'Application of Multiple Ultrasonic Techniques in the Diagnosis of Prostate Cancer.', 'The role of diagnostic ultrasound imaging for patients with known prostate cancer within an active surveillance pathway: A systematic review.', 'Deep Recurrent Neural Networks for Prostate Cancer Detection: Analysis of Temporal Enhanced Ultrasound.', 'Toward a real-time system for temporal enhanced ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy.', 'Limiting overdiagnosis of low-risk prostate cancer through an evaluation of the predictive value of transrectal and power Doppler ultrasonography.']"""

In this dose escalation phase I study, we report safety, feasibility, and immunologic data of an immunotherapy composed of 2 human PC cell lines engineered to express αGal epitopes (HyperAcute-Prostate, HAP, NewLink Genetics). Eight patients received up to 12 biweekly vaccinations with HAP. Enrolled patients (aged range, 53-85 y) had American Joint Committee on Cancer stage IV, any T, any N, M1, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group PS≤2, at least 1 prior hormonal treatment and <3 prior chemotherapies, adequate bone marrow and organ function, and albumin ≥3.0 g/dL. Serum IgG antibodies to synthetic peptides overexpressed in PC were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results indicate that HAP immunotherapy induced humoral immune responses to autoantigens in 2 of 8 patients. These patients developed IgG antibody to multiple epitopes overexpressed in PC after immunization. These responding patients received higher doses of the immunotherapy suggesting a dose response. Two immunogenic proteins (prostate-specific membrane antigen, hepsin) belong to the extracellular molecules family participating in malignant cell invasion. Median overall survival for patients was 25.1 months with 1 patient surviving over 70 months with stable PSA and bone metastasis before expiring of other causes. Three of 8 patients showed PSA stabilization (>100 d). In conclusion, HAP immunotherapy induces IgG responses to epitopes from autoantigens overexpressed in PC suggesting dose-dependent effect.

We compared histopathological findings of prostate biopsies with the results of TRUS and elastography.  Results:   32.17% of all patients were positive for prostate cancer.TRUS showed a sensitivity of 76.35% with a low specificity (43.59%), a Positive Predictive Value (PPV) of 39.1% and a Negative Predictive Value (NPV) of 79.53%.

It completely blocks the synthesis and release of gonadotropins (LH and FSH), thus rapidly reducing the testosterone levels without causing clinical flare. The results of the clinical trials (36 months) demonstrate that degarelix, compared to high-dose leuprorelin (7.5 mg), suppresses levels of testosterone and PSA (Prostate-Specific Antigen) more rapidly and reduces levels of FSH and musculoskeletal events associated with treatment (pain, muscle weakness, spasms, oedema/joint stiffness, arthralgia, osteoporosis and osteopoenia) to a greater extent. In addition, these results demonstrate a significant increase in the probability of PSA progression-free survival, suggesting a possible delay in the onset of the ""castration-resistant"" stage.

In this study, we present a model system in which a C-terminally truncated variant of androgen receptor (TC-AR) is inducibly expressed in LNCaP, an androgen-dependent cell line, which expresses little truncated receptor. We observed that when TC-AR is overexpressed, the endogenous full length receptor (FL-AR) is transcriptionally downmodulated. This in essence allows us to ""replace"" FL-AR with TC-AR and compare their individual properties in exactly the same genetic and cellular background, which has not been performed before.

We also show that while there is significant overlap in the genes regulated by FL- and TC-AR there are also differences in the respective suites of target genes with each AR form regulating genes that the other does not. Among the genes uniquely activated by TC-AR is RHOB which is shown to be involved in the increased migration and morphological changes observed in LN/TC-AR, suggesting a role of RHOB in the regulation of androgen-independent behavior of prostate cancer cells.""","""['Hui-Chi Tsai', 'David L Boucher', 'Anthony Martinez', 'Clifford G Tepper', 'Hsing-Jien Kung']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Identification of novel androgen receptor target genes in prostate cancer.', 'Mechanism of androgen receptor corepression by CKβBP2/CRIF1, a multifunctional transcription factor coregulator expressed in prostate cancer.', 'Increased expression of androgen receptor sensitizes prostate cancer cells to low levels of androgens.', 'Androgen receptor variant-driven prostate cancer: clinical implications and therapeutic targeting.', 'The androgen receptor messenger RNA: what do we know?', 'Targeting androgen receptor and the variants by an orally bioavailable Proteolysis Targeting Chimeras compound in castration resistant prostate cancer.', ""The Signaling Pathways Project, an integrated 'omics knowledgebase for mammalian cellular signaling pathways."", 'Dual effects of constitutively active androgen receptor and full-length androgen receptor for N-cadherin regulation in prostate cancer.', 'ROR-γ drives androgen receptor expression and represents a therapeutic target in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Overview on the complexity of androgen receptor-targeted therapy for prostate cancer.']"""

Moreover, mTOR activation has been implicated in the resistance of cancer cells to many anticancer drugs, rendering this pathway a promising pharmacotherapeutic target. Here we explored the capability of a semisynthetic compound to intercept mTOR signaling. We synthesized and chemically characterized a novel, semisynthetic triterpenoid derivative, 3-cinnamoyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid (C-KβBA). Its pharmacodynamic effects on mTOR and several other signaling pathways were assessed in a number of prostate and breast cancer cell lines as well as in normal prostate epithelial cells. C-KβBA exhibits specific antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects in cancer cell lines in vitro as well as in PC-3 prostate cancer xenografts in vivo. Mechanistically, the compound significantly inhibits the cap-dependent transition machinery, decreases expression of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E and cyclin D1, and induces G(1) cell-cycle arrest. In contrast to conventional mTOR inhibitors, C-KβBA downregulates the phosphorylation of p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, the major downstream target of mTOR complex 1, without concomitant activation of mTOR complex 2/Akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathways, and independently of protein phosphatase 2A, liver kinase B1/AMP-activated protein kinase/tuberous sclerosis complex, and F12-protein binding. At the molecular level, the compound binds to the FKBP12-rapamycin-binding domain of mTOR with high affinity, thereby competing with the endogenous mTOR activator phosphatidic acid.

In addition, pretreatment measurements for prostate IMRT (50 patients, 309 beams) were performed by EPID and were evaluated by the gamma method (criterion: 3 mm/3 %). The signal-to-monitor unit ratio of PD showed dose dependence, indicating ghosting effects. Tongue-and-groove effects were observed as a result of the dose difference in the measured EPID images. The results of PD for clinical IMRT beams were in good agreement with the predicted dose image with average values of 1.37 and 0.25 for γ (max) and γ (ave), respectively.

This phase 1 trial evaluated the safety, tracer stability and uptake kinetics of [(18)F]fluciclovine in patients.  Methods:   Six patients with biopsy-proven prostate cancer were investigated with 3-T MRI and PET/CT. All underwent dynamic [(18)F]fluciclovine PET/CT of the pelvic area for up to 120 min after injection of 418 ± 10 MBq of tracer with simultaneous blood sampling of radioactivity. The kinetics of uptake in tumours and normal tissues were evaluated using standardized uptake values (SUVs) and compartmental modelling.  Results:   Tumour deposits as defined by MRI were clearly visualized by PET. Urine excretion was minimal and normal tissue background was low. Uptake of [(18)F]fluciclovine in tumour from the blood was rapid and the tumour-to-normal tissue contrast was highest between 1 and 15 min after injection with a 65 % reduction in mean tumour uptake at 90 min after injection. A one-compartment model fitted the tracer kinetics well. Early SUVs correlated well with both the influx rate constant (K (1)) and the volume of distribution of the tracer (V (T)). There were no signs of tracer metabolite formation. The product was well tolerated in all patients without significant adverse events.  Conclusion:   [(18)F]Fluciclovine shows high uptake in prostate cancer deposits and appears safe for use in humans. The production is robust and the formulation stable in vivo.

We identified active β1 integrin as a biochemical and functional partner of the membrane-retained 70-kDa CDCP1 fragment, newly generated from its full-length 135-kDa precursor though proteolytic cleavage by serine proteases. Both in cell cultures and in live animals, active β1 integrin complexed preferentially with functionally activated, phosphorylated 70-kDa CDCP1. Complexing of β1 integrin the 70-kDa with CDCP1 fragment induced intracellular phosphorylation signaling, involving focal adhesion kinase-1 (FAK) and PI3 kinase (PI3K)-dependent Akt activation. Thus, inhibition of FAK/PI3K activities by specific inhibitors as well as short-hairpin RNA downregulation of β1 integrin significantly reduced FAK/Akt phosphorylation under conditions where CDCP1 was processed by serine proteases, indicating that FAK/PI3K/Akt pathway operates downstream of cleaved CDCP1 complexed with β1 integrin. Furthermore, this complex-dependent signaling correlated positively with high levels of tumor cell intravasation and dissemination. Correspondingly, abrogation in vivo of CDCP1 cleavage either by unique cleavage-blocking monoclonal antibody 10-D7 or by inhibition of proteolytic activity of plasmin-like serine proteases with aprotinin prevented β1 integrin/CDCP1 complexing and downstream FAK/Akt signaling concomitant with significant reduction of stromal invasion and spontaneous metastasis. Therefore, β1 integrin appears to serve as a motility-regulating partner mediating cross-talk between proteolytically cleaved, membrane-retained CDCP1 and members of FAK/PI3K/Akt pathway. This CDCP1 cleavage-induced signaling cascade constitutes a unique mechanism, independent of extracellular matrix remodeling, whereby a proteolytically cleaved CDCP1 regulates in vivo locomotion and metastasis of tumor cells through β1 integrin partnering. Our findings indicate that CDCP1 cleavage, occurring at the apex of a β1 integrin/FAK/PI3K/Akt signaling cascade, may represent a therapeutic target for CDCP1-positive cancers.""","""['B Casar', 'I Rimann', 'H Kato', 'S J Shattil', 'J P Quigley', 'E I Deryugina']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['Blocking of CDCP1 cleavage in vivo prevents Akt-dependent survival and inhibits metastatic colonization through PARP1-mediated apoptosis of cancer cells.', ""Insulin-like growth factor-1 induces adhesion and migration in human multiple myeloma cells via activation of beta1-integrin and phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase/AKT signaling."", 'Focal adhesion kinase is upstream of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt in regulating fibroblast survival in response to contraction of type I collagen matrices via a beta 1 integrin viability signaling pathway.', 'Roles of CUB domain-containing protein 1 signaling in cancer invasion and metastasis.', 'Focal adhesion kinase and its potential involvement in tumor invasion and metastasis.', 'Mechanistic insights into CDCP1 clustering on non-small-cell lung cancer membranes revealed by super-resolution fluorescent imaging.', 'The roles of proteases in prostate cancer.', 'CDCP1 expression is frequently increased in aggressive urothelial carcinoma and promotes urothelial tumor progression.', 'Overexpression of Laminin 5γ2 Chain Correlates with Tumor Cell Proliferation, Invasion, and Poor Prognosis in Laryngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma.', 'Antibody-Based Approaches to Target Pancreatic Tumours.']"""

The mechanisms by which NE cells influence PCa growth and progression are not fully understood. Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine involved in oncogenic processes, and MIF serum levels correlate with aggressiveness of PCa. Here, we investigated the regulation and the functional consequences of MIF expression during NE transdifferentiation of PCa cells. NE differentiation (NED) of LNCaP cells, initiated either by increasing intracellular levels of cAMP or by culturing cells in an androgen-depleted medium, was associated with markedly increased MIF release. Yet, intracellular MIF protein and mRNA levels and MIF gene promoter activity decreased during NED of LNCaP cells, suggesting that NED favours MIF release despite decreasing MIF synthesis. Adenoviral-mediated forced MIF expression in NE-differentiated LNCaP cells increased cell proliferation without affecting the expression of NE markers. Addition of exogenous recombinant MIF to LNCaP and PC-3 cells stimulated the AKT and ERK1/2 signalling pathways, the expression of genes involved in PCa, as well as proliferation and resistance to paclitaxel and thapsigargin-induced apoptosis. Altogether, these data provide evidence that increased MIF release during NED in PCa may facilitate cancer progression or recurrence, especially following androgen deprivation.

Baseline demographic features, perioperative data, and oncologic outcomes were reviewed.  Results:   At diagnosis, mean patient age was 63.3 years and serum prostate specific antigen was 6.17 ng/mL. The mean total operative time was 186 minutes (range, 80-210 minutes). No intraoperative complications were noted. The mean hospital length of stay was 1.8 days (range, 1-3 days). Clavien grade II postoperative complications occurred in 3 of the 7 patients (42.9%), consisting of urosepsis, atrial fibrillation, and gross hematuria, all resolving with appropriate medical management. No significant changes were observed in graft function. Two patients (28.6%) had positive surgical margins. During a mean follow-up of 16 months, 1 patient with pathologic T3a, Gleason 9 cancer experienced a biochemical recurrence, which was treated with salvage external-beam radiation and androgen-deprivation therapy.

Methods:   We used Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare data to identify men diagnosed with prostate cancer between 2001 and 2007 who were treated with radiotherapy (n = 55,162). We categorized managed care penetration in Health Service Areas (HSAs) as low (<3%), intermediate (3%-10%), and high (>10%), and assessed our main outcomes (ie, probability of IMRT adoption, which is the ability of a health care market to deliver IMRT, and IMRT utilization in HSA markets) using a Cox proportional hazards model and Poisson regression model, respectively.  Results:   Compared with markets with low managed care penetration, populations in highly penetrated HSAs were more racially diverse (25% vs 15% non-white, P <.01), densely populated (2110 vs 145 people/square mile, P <.01), and wealthier (median income, $48,500 vs $31,900, P <.01). The probability of IMRT adoption was greatest in markets with the highest managed care penetration (eg, 0.82 [high] vs 0.72 [low] in 2007, P = .05). Among adopting markets, the use of IMRT increased in all HSA categories. However, relative to markets with low managed care penetration, IMRT use was constrained in markets with the highest penetration (0.69 [high] vs 0.76 [low] in 2007, P <.01).  Conclusion:   Markets with higher managed care penetration demonstrated a greater propensity for acquiring IMRT technology. However, after adopting IMRT, more highly penetrated markets had roughly 7% slower growth in IMRT use during the study period.

Topographical information regarding PCa extension and positive surgical margins (PSM) is essential for clinical routines, quality assessment, and research. However, local hospital information systems (HIS) often do not support the documentation of such information. Therefore, we investigated the feasibility of integrating a cMDX-based pathology report including topographical information into the clinical routine with the aims of obtaining data, performing analysis and generating heat maps in a timely manner, while avoiding data redundancy.  Methods:   We analyzed the workflow of the histopathological evaluation documentation process. We then developed a concept for a pathology report based on a cMDX data model facilitating the topographical documentation of PCa and PSM; the cMDX SSIS is implemented within the HIS of University Hospital Muenster. We then generated a heat map of PCa extension and PSM using the data. Data quality was assessed by measuring the data completeness of reports for all cases, as well as the source-to-database error. We also conducted a prospective study to compare our proposed method with recent retrospective and paper-based studies according to the time required for data analysis.  Results:   We identified 30 input fields that were applied to the cMDX-based data model and the electronic report was integrated into the clinical workflow. Between 2010 and 2011, a total of 259 reports were generated with 100% data completeness and a source-to-database error of 10.3 per 10,000 fields. These reports were directly reused for data analysis, and a heat map based on the data was generated. PCa was mostly localized in the peripheral zone of the prostate. The mean relative tumor volume was 16.6%. The most PSM were localized in the apical region of the prostate. In the retrospective study, 1623 paper-based reports were transferred to cMDX reports; this process took 15 ± 2 minutes per report. In a paper-based study, the analysis data preparation required 45 ± 5 minutes per report.  Conclusions:   cMDX SSIS can be integrated into the local HIS and provides clinical routine data and timely heat maps for quality assessment and research purposes.""","""['Okyaz Eminaga', 'Mahmoud Abbas', 'Reemt Hinkelammert', 'Ulf Titze', 'Olaf Bettendorf', 'Elke Eltze', 'Enver Ozgür', 'Axel Semjonow']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""BMC Med Inform Decis Mak""","""['Clinical map document based on XML (cMDX): document architecture with mapping feature for reporting and analysing prostate cancer in radical prostatectomy specimens.', 'Analysis of topographical distribution of prostate cancer and related pathological findings in prostatectomy specimens using cMDX document architecture.', 'Preoperative Serum Prostate-Specific Antigen Levels Vary According to the Topographical Distribution of Prostate Cancer in Prostatectomy Specimens.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Prognostic significance of tumor volume in radical prostatectomy and needle biopsy specimens.', 'Automatic cancer detection on digital histopathology images of mid-gland radical prostatectomy specimens.', 'Clinical decision support systems for improving diagnostic accuracy and achieving precision medicine.', 'Exploring prostate cancer genome reveals simultaneous losses of PTEN, FAS and PAPSS2 in patients with PSA recurrence after radical prostatectomy.', 'Linkage of data from diverse data sources (LDS): a data combination model provides clinical data of corresponding specimens in biobanking information system.']"""

Results:   The median Prostate Health Index was significantly higher in men with prostate cancer than in those with negative biopsies using WHO values (47.4 vs 39.8, p <0.001). The index offered improved discrimination of prostate cancer detection on biopsy (AUC 0.704) compared to percent free or total prostate specific antigen using the WHO calibration.

In studies predicting RT morbidity, the single estimate of the delivered dose provided by the treatment planning computed tomography (pCT) is typically assumed to be representative of the dose distribution throughout the course of RT. In this paper, a simple model for describing organ motion is introduced, and is associated to late rectal morbidity data, with the aim of improving morbidity prediction.  Material and methods:   Organ motion was described by normally distributed translational motion, with its magnitude characterised by the standard deviation (SD) of this distribution. Simulations of both isotropic and anisotropic (anterior-posterior only) motion patterns were performed, as were random, systematic or combined random and systematic motion. The associations between late rectal morbidity and motion-inclusive delivered dose-volume histograms (dDVHs) were quantified using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (Rs) in a series of 232 prostate cancer patients, and were compared to the associations obtained with the static/planned DVH (pDVH).  Results:   For both isotropic and anisotropic motion, different associations with rectal morbidity were seen with the dDVHs relative to the pDVHs. The differences were most pronounced in the mid-dose region (40-60 Gy). The associations were dependent on the applied motion patterns, with the strongest association with morbidity obtained by applying random motion with an SD in the range 0.2-0.8 cm.  Conclusion:   In this study we have introduced a simple model for describing organ motion occurring during RT. Differing and, for some cases, stronger dose-volume dependencies were found between the motion-inclusive dose distributions and rectal morbidity as compared to the associations with the planned dose distributions. This indicates that rectal organ motion during RT influences the efforts to model the risk of morbidity using planning distributions alone.""","""['Maria Thor', 'Aditya Apte', 'Joseph O Deasy', 'Ludvig Paul Muren']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Acta Oncol""","""['Rectum motion and morbidity prediction: Improving correlation between late morbidity and DVH parameters through use of rectum planning organ at risk volumes.', 'Dose/volume-response relations for rectal morbidity using planned and simulated motion-inclusive dose distributions.', 'A study on planning organ at risk volume for the rectum using cone beam computed tomography in the treatment of prostate cancer.', 'Effectiveness of rectal displacement devices during prostate external-beam radiation therapy: A review.', 'Reducing rectal injury during external beam radiotherapy for prostate cancer.', 'Associations between voxel-level accumulated dose and rectal toxicity in prostate radiotherapy.', 'Autosegmentation of the rectum on megavoltage image guidance scans.', 'A multiple-image-based method to evaluate the performance of deformable image registration in the pelvis.', 'An image-based method to quantify biomechanical properties of the rectum in radiotherapy of prostate cancer.', 'The distance discordance metric-a novel approach to quantifying spatial uncertainties in intra- and inter-patient deformable image registration.']"""

Intracellular cholesterol promotes prostate cancer progression as a substrate for de novo androgen synthesis and through regulation of AKT signaling. By conducting next-generation sequencing-based DNA methylome analysis, we have discovered marked hypermethylation at the promoter of the major cellular cholesterol efflux transporter, ABCA1, in LNCaP prostate cancer cells. ABCA1 promoter hypermethylation renders the promoter unresponsive to transactivation and leads to elevated cholesterol levels in LNCaP. ABCA1 promoter hypermethylation is enriched in intermediate- to high-grade prostate cancers and not detectable in benign prostate. Remarkably, ABCA1 downregulation is evident in all prostate cancers examined, and expression levels are inversely correlated with Gleason grade.

Yet, the regulation of androgen receptor signaling remains elusive. Even with stringent androgen deprivation therapy, androgen receptor signaling persists. Here, our data suggest that there is a complex interaction between the expression of the tumor suppressor miRNA, miR-31, and androgen receptor signaling. We examined primary and metastatic prostate cancer and found that miR-31 expression was reduced as a result of promoter hypermethylation, and importantly, the levels of miR-31 expression were inversely correlated with the aggressiveness of the disease. As the expression of androgen receptor and miR-31 was inversely correlated in the cell lines, our study further suggested that miR-31 and androgen receptor could mutually repress each other. Upregulation of miR-31 effectively suppressed androgen receptor expression through multiple mechanisms and inhibited prostate cancer growth in vivo. Notably, we found that miR-31 targeted androgen receptor directly at a site located in the coding region, which was commonly mutated in prostate cancer. In addition, miR-31 suppressed cell-cycle regulators including E2F1, E2F2, EXO1, FOXM1, and MCM2. Together, our findings suggest a novel androgen receptor regulatory mechanism mediated through miR-31 expression.

Methods:   We combined MNAzyme components with PCR primers and standard qPCR reagents to perform MNAzyme qPCR and reverse-transcription qPCR (RT-qPCR) assays with a set of universal reporter probes. Assays were performed on single targets and in multiplex formats that combined up to 5 different targets in a single reaction.  Results:   A comparison of 3 targets amplified in single and triplex formats showed no significant differences with respect to detection limit or amplification efficiency. Likewise, we successfully converted single-target assays for 11 transcripts of interest to triplex assays containing 2 reference transcripts without having to optimize or modify the conditions. A quintuplex RT-qPCR that simultaneously quantified 5 transcripts with 5 universal probes produced high amplification efficiencies and r(2) values for all transcripts. Despite the large numbers of oligonucleotides in the reactions, we observed no false-positive signals, owing to the requirement of 4 target-specific binding events to produce a signal. A quadruplex assay that combined MNAzymes with methylation-specific PCR to measure epigenetic biomarkers of prostate cancer was capable of detecting a single methylated DNA allele in a background of 1000-10 000 unmethylated alleles. The MNAzyme qPCR was compatible with a rapid-cycling protocol.  Conclusions:   MNAzymes offer a flexible and unique approach to qPCR that is specific, sensitive, and easily multiplexed.

MicroRNA (miRNA) have the potential to be used as biomarkers and therapeutic targets for the treatment of various cancers. We found significantly higher expression of miR-30d in 3 PCa cell lines (PC3, DU145 and LNCaP) compared with 2 normal prostate cell lines (RWPE-1 and PrSc) using miRNA microarrays and qPCR. Clinicopathological study revealed that miR-30d expression levels were significantly higher in cancer tissue samples than in the paired normal controls (P = 0.03). Furthermore, the miR-30d-high group had shorter time to biochemical recurrence (P = 0.026). MiR-30d overexpressed PCa cells promoted proliferation and invasion in vitro. Inoculation of miR-30d depleted PCa cells dramatically reduced tumor volumes in vivo. Using reporter gene assay, we identified miR-30d as a downregulator of SOCS1 expression by directly binding to 3'-UTR of SOCS1. MiR-30d regulated the expression of phospho-STAT3, MMP-2 and MMP-9 through the downregulation of SOCS1. The levels of SOCS1 mRNA and protein were significantly down-regulated in prostate cancer tissues. Consistently, miR-30d expression was inversely correlated with SOCS1 expression (P = 0.03). The miR-30d-high/SOCS1-low group was associated with an increased risk of early biochemical recurrence (P = 0.0057).

In the present study, we evaluated the role of SNCG in prostate cancer progression and explored the underlying mechanisms.  Methods:   First, alteration of SNCG expression in LNCaP cell line to test the ability of SNCG on cellular properties in vitro and vivo whenever exposing with androgen or not. Subsequently, the Dual-luciferase reporter assays were performed to evaluate whether the role of SNCG in LNCaP is through AR signaling. Last, the association between SNCG and prostate cancer progression was assessed immunohistochemically using a series of human prostate tissues.  Results:   Silencing SNCG by siRNA in LNCaP cells contributes to the inhibition of cellular proliferation, the induction of cell-cycle arrest at the G1 phase, the suppression of cellular migration and invasion in vitro, as well as the decrease of tumor growth in vivo with the notable exception of castrated mice. Subsequently, mechanistic studies indicated that SNCG is a novel androgen receptor (AR) coactivator. It interacts with AR and promotes prostate cancer cellular growth and proliferation by activating AR transcription in an androgen-dependent manner. Finally, immunohistochemical analysis revealed that SNCG was almost undetectable in benign or androgen-independent tissues prostate lesions. The high expression of SNCG is correlated with peripheral and lymph node invasion.  Conclusions:   Our data suggest that SNCG may serve as a biomarker for predicting human prostate cancer progression and metastasis. It also may become as a novel target for biomedical therapy in advanced prostate cancer.""","""['Junyi Chen', 'Li Jiao', 'Chuanliang Xu', 'Yongwei Yu', 'Zhensheng Zhang', 'Zheng Chang', 'Zhen Deng', 'Yinghao Sun']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['TACC2 is an androgen-responsive cell cycle regulator promoting androgen-mediated and castration-resistant growth of prostate cancer.', 'Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1alpha interacts with the androgen receptor (AR) and promotes prostate cancer cell growth by activating the AR.', 'Androgen-independent LNCaP cells are a subline of LNCaP cells with a more aggressive phenotype and androgen suppresses their growth by inducing cell cycle arrest at the G1\xa0phase.', 'Androgens as therapy for androgen receptor-positive castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'HER-2/neu receptor in prostate cancer development and progression to androgen independence.', 'Upregulation of Synuclein-γ and Snai1 Contributes to Poor Clinical Prognosis in Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma Patients.', 'Gamma-synuclein is a novel prognostic marker that promotes tumor cell migration in biliary tract carcinoma.', 'Adiponectin paradox as a therapeutic target of the cancer evolvability in aging.', 'Dual Inhibitory Action of a Novel AKR1C3 Inhibitor on Both Full-Length AR and the Variant AR-V7 in Enzalutamide Resistant Metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Alpha-synuclein is a DNA binding protein that modulates DNA repair with implications for Lewy body disorders.']"""

This study determined the cost/benefit balance of introducing PCA3 in the decision-making for PBx in France.  Methods:   Two RAM models, without and with PCA3, were retrospectively applied to a sample of 808 French men who had PBx in 2010 (78% first, 22% repeat). Outcome measures included the proportion of PBx that could have been avoided (i.e., judged inappropriate) in the French sample according to both RAM models, and the estimated impact of application of these models on the annual number of PBx and associated costs for France (based on most recent published data).  Results:   Complete profiles were available for 698 men. In the model without PCA3, 2% of PBx were deemed inappropriate. Knowledge of PCA3 would have avoided another 7% of PBx. Repeat PBx would have been avoided in 5% of cases without PCA3 and in 37% with PCA3. For France, application of the RAM model including PCA3 would result in 18,345 fewer repeat PBx. It would be budget-neutral in the unlikely hypothesis of no complications or no costs incurred by complications and would save €1.7 million for a mean cost for complications of €100/procedure or €5 million for a mean cost for complications of €280/procedure, calculated based on US and Canadian data.  Limitations:   Limitations of the study are the theoretical nature of the analysis and the fact that PCA3 distributions had to be derived from other sources.

The perturbed DVH is calculated by using a dedicated software, 3DVH (Sun Nuclear Corporation, Melbourne, FL), which is able to modify the dose distribution calculated by the treatment planning system (TPS) according to the dose discrepancies detected with planar measurements in order to predict the delivered 3D dose distribution in the patient.  Methods:   Twenty-seven high-risk prostate cancer (PP) patients and 15 head and neck (HN) cancer patients, treated with IMRT technique, were analyzed. Pretreatment verifications were performed for all patients' plans by acquiring planar dose distributions of each treatment field with 2D-diode array. Measured dose distributions were compared to the calculated ones using the gamma index (GI) method applying both global (Van Dyk) and local normalization, and %GP were generated for each pair of planar doses using the following acceptance criteria: 1%∕1, 2%∕2, and 3%∕3 mm. Planar dose distributions acquired during pretreatment verifications, together with patient's DICOM RT plan, RT structure set, and RT dose files from TPS were loaded into the 3DVH software. Percentage dose differences (%DE) between DVHs, obtained by TPS and by 3DVH, were calculated; statistical correlation between %DE and %GP was studied by using Pearson's correlation coefficient (r). This analysis was performed, for each patient, on planning target volumes and on some typical organs at risk of the prostatic and head and neck anatomical district. The sensitivity was calculated to correctly identify the pretreatment plans with high dose errors and to quantify the incidence of false negatives, on varying the gamma index method.  Results:   Analysis of %DE vs %GP showed that there were only weak correlations (Pearson's r-values < 0.8). The results also showed numerous instances of false negatives (cases where high IMRT QA passing rates did not imply good agreement in anatomy dose metrics) and the reverse, mainly for the 3%∕3 mm global gamma passing rate.

Methods:   A gradient-descent algorithm is used to optimize tomotherapy-like treatments, while VMAT-like optimization is carried out using a direct-aperture simulated annealing algorithm with 180 control points equispaced at 2° angles. Dose distributions are linked to fluences via a three-dimensional double-gaussian pencil beam model. Plans are optimized for a prostate geometry, outlined according to the CHHiP protocol. The cost function used for optimization contains ten simple functions, each of which describes a single planning objective. These functions are split into three structure groups according to whether they are used to control PTV, rectal or bladder dose levels. Different optimizations have been performed by varying the relative weights of each of these structure groups, exploring in this way a three-dimensional Pareto front. Plan quality is studied according to the value of the optimized cost function and the relative Euclidean distance between the components of the cost function and those of the nearest plan lying on a reference Pareto front obtained for tomotherapy-like plans generated using a 1 cm fan-beam width and 1/3 pitch.  Results:   The quality of tomotherapy-like optimization depends on the fan-beam width, s, and rotation pitch, p, used to deliver the treatment. These values together define the effective longitudinal resolution with which fluence can be modulated, and lower cost function values are obtained for treatments optimized with tighter pitches and narrower fan-beam widths (higher modulation resolution). On the other hand, the cost function values of VMAT-like optimizations depends on the optimization running time, leaf displacement constraints, and number of arcs employed, as well as on the size of the beamlets used in the optimization (a change in leaf width from 5 to 10 mm clearly worsens the value of the objective function, but only a marginal improvement is observed when the leaf movement discretization step is reduced from 5 to 5/3 mm). However, for no combination of these parameter values did VMAT-like optimizations match the cost function values of optimized tomo-like plans obtained for s = 1 cm and p = 1∕3 (or 1/2). This is the case all across the Pareto front. On the other hand, cost function values of VMAT-like plans are generally lower than those of optimized tomotherapy-like plans obtained for s = 2.5 cm.  Conclusions:   Tomotherapy-like plans created for the prostate geometry using a 1 cm fan-beam width and pitches of 1/3 or 1/2 have lower cost function values than VMAT-like plans, although the associated dosimetric improvements are quite small, both techniques generating very good dose distributions. When a 2.5 cm wide fan-beam is used for tomotherapy-like treatments the pattern is reversed, the tomotherapy-like plans having higher cost functions than the VMAT-like ones.""","""['Juan Pardo-Montero', 'John D Fenwick']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['An approach to multiobjective optimization of rotational therapy.

The identification of delayed-onset cell death has allowed for the manipulation of cellular responses through the regulation of apoptosis. We hypothesized that in addition to delayed apoptotic events associated with mild subfreezing temperatures (10 to -25 °C), cells exposed to ultra-low temperatures (<-30 °C) may undergo rapid, early-onset apoptosis.  Methods:   Human prostate cancer model and cells (PC-3) were exposed to temperatures of -60, -30 and -15 °C to simulate a cryoablative procedure. Using a combination of flow-cytometry, fluorescent microscopy and western blot analyses, samples were assessed at various times post thaw to identify the presence, levels and the pathways involved in cell death.  Results:   Exposure to temperatures <-30 °C yielded a significant apoptotic population within 30 min of thawing, peaking at 90 min (~40%), and by 6 h, only necrosis was observed. In samples only reaching temperatures >-30 °C, apoptosis was not noted until 6-24 h post thaw, with the levels of apoptosis reaching ~10% (-15 °C) and ~25% (-30 °C) at 6 h post thaw. Further, it was found that early-onset apoptosis progressed through a membrane-mediated mechanism, whereas delayed apoptosis progressed through a mitochondrial path.  Conclusions:   These data demonstrate the impact of apoptotic continuum, whereby the more severe cryogenic stress activated the extrinsic, membrane-regulated pathway, whereas less severe freezing activated the intrinsic, mitochondrial-mediated path. The rapid induction and progression of apoptosis at ultra-low temperatures provides an explanation as to why such results have not previously been identified following freezing. Ultimately, an understanding of the events and signaling pathways involved in triggering apoptosis following freezing may provide a path for selective induction of the rapid-onset and delayed programmed cell death pathways in an effort to improve the overall cryoablation efficacy.""","""['A T Robilotto', 'J M Baust', 'R G Van Buskirk', 'A A Gage', 'J G Baust']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['Cryosurgical technique: assessment of the fundamental variables using human prostate cancer model systems.', 'Chemo-cryo combination therapy: an adjunctive model for the treatment of prostate cancer.', 'Cryoablative response of prostate cancer cells is influenced by androgen receptor expression.', 'Targeted induction of apoptosis via TRAIL and cryoablation: a novel strategy for the treatment of prostate cancer.', 'The pathophysiology of thermoablation: optimizing cryoablation.', 'Boosting the Immune Response-Combining Local and Immune Therapy for Prostate Cancer Treatment.', 'An In Vitro Investigation into Cryoablation and Adjunctive Cryoablation/Chemotherapy Combination Therapy for the Treatment of Pancreatic Cancer Using the PANC-1 Cell Line.', 'Investigation of Bladder Cancer Cell Response to Cryoablation and Adjunctive Cisplatin Based Cryo/Chemotherapy.', 'Future perspective of focal therapy for localized prostate cancer.', 'Breast Cancer Cryoablation: Assessment of the Impact of Fundamental Procedural Variables in an In Vitro Human Breast Cancer Model.']"""

The aim of this present study is to determine the role of PNI on prostate biopsy in predicting adverse findings at radical prostatectomy in a recent cohort of screen detected prostate cancer.  Materials and methods:   We analyzed 470 patients diagnosed with prostate cancer from a prospectively maintained database at Princess Margaret Hospital. Out of the 470 patients diagnosed with prostate cancer, 139 underwent radical prostatectomy. Pathological specimens were examined, and perineural invasion was identified as carcinoma tracking along or around a nerve in the perineural space. We investigated the predictive value of PNI on biopsy with PNI on radical prostatectomy as well as the ability of PNI on prostate biopsy to predict adverse findings at radical prostatectomy.  Results:   Perineural invasion was present in 124 (26%) of biopsy specimens diagnosed with prostate cancer and 94 (68%) of those who chose radical prostatectomy. Perineural invasion on prostate needle biopsy was not predictive of radical prostatectomy Gleason score (p = .377), pathological stage (p = .852), extraprostatic extension (p = .258), surgical margin (p = .079), lymphovascular invasion (p = .499), and upgrading (p = .514) or downgrading (p = .208) at radical prostatectomy. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of PNI on biopsy for PNI on radical prostatectomy were 32%, 82%, 79%, and 37% respectively. The Cohen's Kappa correlation coefficient was .11.  Conclusions:   Perineural invasion on prostate needle biopsy is not predictive of radical prostatectomy outcome.

We evaluated a contemporary cohort of men undergoing PNB to determine cancer detection rates when stratified by DRE status.  Materials and methods:   The charts of 806 men who underwent a PNB were reviewed. Serum PSA was categorized as normal or abnormal according to age-specific criteria. A normal DRE was defined as a smooth, age-appropriate, asymmetric, or uniformly enlarged prostate. An abnormal DRE was defined by either a nodule or induration. Sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values were determined for an abnormal DRE and the diagnosis of prostate cancer.  Results:   Within the cohort, 516 patients (64%) had a normal and 290 (36%) an abnormal DRE. Three hundred six (38%) men were diagnosed with prostate cancer of which 136 (44%) had an abnormal DRE. Fourteen percent of patients with prostate cancer had an isolated DRE abnormality. Furthermore, when specifically considering these 136 men with an abnormal DRE and prostate cancer, 43 (31%) had a normal age-specific PSA value. No differences in cancer detection rate were noted when stratifying by type of DRE abnormality. In this select cohort of patients undergoing prostate biopsy, an abnormal DRE had a sensitivity of 44%, specificity of 68%, positive predictive value (PPV) of 46%, and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 67% for detecting prostate cancer on biopsy.  Conclusion:   Almost 50% of men in our cohort diagnosed with prostate cancer had an abnormal DRE.

We evaluated this agent in patients who had not received previous chemotherapy.  Methods:   In this double-blind study, we randomly assigned 1088 patients to receive abiraterone acetate (1000 mg) plus prednisone (5 mg twice daily) or placebo plus prednisone. The coprimary end points were radiographic progression-free survival and overall survival.  Results:   The study was unblinded after a planned interim analysis that was performed after 43% of the expected deaths had occurred. The median radiographic progression-free survival was 16.5 months with abiraterone-prednisone and 8.3 months with prednisone alone (hazard ratio for abiraterone-prednisone vs. prednisone alone, 0.53; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.45 to 0.62; P<0.001). Over a median follow-up period of 22.2 months, overall survival was improved with abiraterone-prednisone (median not reached, vs. 27.2 months for prednisone alone; hazard ratio, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.61 to 0.93; P=0.01) but did not cross the efficacy boundary. Abiraterone-prednisone showed superiority over prednisone alone with respect to time to initiation of cytotoxic chemotherapy, opiate use for cancer-related pain, prostate-specific antigen progression, and decline in performance status. Grade 3 or 4 mineralocorticoid-related adverse events and abnormalities on liver-function testing were more common with abiraterone-prednisone.

Methods:   A group of 27 patients presenting with PSA progression during primary HT for local prostate cancer RT was identified among patients who were treated in the years 2000-2004 either using external-beam RT (EBRT; 70.2 Gy; n=261) or Ir-192 brachytherapy as a boost to EBRT (HDR-BT; 18 Gy + 50.4 Gy; n=71). The median follow-up period after RT was 68 months.  Results:   Median biochemical recurrence free (BRFS), disease specific (DSS) and overall survival (OS) for patients with PSA progression during primary HT was found to be only 21, 54 and 53 months, respectively, with a 6-year BRFS, DSS and OS of 19%, 41% and 26%. There were no significant differences between different RT concepts (6-year OS of 27% after EBRT and 20% after EBRT with HDR-BT).Considering all 332 patients in multivariate Cox regression analysis, PSA progression during initial HT, Gleason score>6 and patient age were found to be predictive for lower OS (p<0.001). The highest hazard ratio resulted for PSA progression during initial HT (7.2 in comparison to patients without PSA progression during primary HT). PSA progression and a nadir >0.5 ng/ml during initial HT were both significant risk factors for biochemical recurrence.

In this study, we demonstrate that the silencing of MTA1 by siRNA treatment results in the upregulation of E-cadherin expression by the phosphorylation of AKT (p-AKT) and decreases the invasiveness of prostate cancer cells. We show that MTA1 is expressed in over 90% of prostate cancer tissues, especially metastatic prostate cancer tissue, comparing to non-expression in normal prostate tissue. RT-PCR analysis and Western blot assay showed that MTA1 expression is significantly higher in highly metastatic prostate cancer PC-3M-1E8 cells (1E8) than in poorly metastatic prostate cancer PC-3M-2B4 cells (2B4). Silencing MTA1 expression by siRNA treatment in 1E8 cells increased the cellular malignant characters, including the cellular adhesive ability, decreased the cellular invasive ability and changed the polarity of cellular cytoskeleton. 1E8 cells over-expressing MTA1 had a reduced expression of E-cadherin, while 1E8 cells treated with MTA1 siRNA had a higher expression of E-cadherin. The expression of phosphorylated AKT (p-AKT) or the inhibition of p-AKT by wortmannin treatment (100 nM) significantly altered the function of MTA1 in the regulation of E-cadherin expression. Alterations in E-cadherin expression changed the role of p-AKT in cellular malignant characters. All of these results demonstrate that MTA1 plays an important role in controlling the malignant transformation of prostate cancer cells through the p-AKT/E-cadherin pathway.

Several mechanisms have been identified in AR activation, among them signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling. Disruption of STAT3 activity has been associated to cancer progression. Recent studies suggest that heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) may play a key role in PCa that may be independent of its catalytic function. We sought to explore whether HO-1 operates on AR transcriptional activity through the STAT3 axis. Our results display that HO-1 induction in PCa cells represses AR activation by decreasing the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) promoter activity and mRNA levels. Strikingly, this is the first report to show by chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis that HO-1 associates to gene promoters, revealing a novel function for HO-1 in the nucleus. Furthermore, HO-1 and STAT3 directly interact as determined by co-immunoprecipitation studies. Forced expression of HO-1 increases STAT3 cytoplasmic retention. When PCa cells were transfected with a constitutively active STAT3 mutant, PSA and STAT3 downstream target genes were abrogated under hemin treatment. Additionally, a significant decrease in pSTAT3 protein levels was detected in the nuclear fraction of these cells. Confocal microscopy images exhibit a decreased rate of AR/STAT3 nuclear co-localization under hemin treatment. In vivo studies confirmed that STAT3 nuclear delimitation was significantly decreased in PC3 tumors overexpressing HO-1 grown as xenografts in nude mice.

In this study, we investigated the functional redundancy of PCs in prostate cancer in the commonly used androgen-sensitive LNCaP and the androgen-independent DU145 human cell lines. Using a lentiviral-based shRNA delivery system, we examined in vitro and in vivo cell proliferation characteristics of knockdown cell lines for the endogenous PCs furin, PACE4, and PC7 in both cell lines. Of the three PCs, only PACE4 was essential to maintain a high-proliferative status, as determined in vitro using XTT proliferation assays and in vivo using tumor xenografts in nude mice. Furin knockdowns in both cell lines had no effects on cell proliferation or tumor xenograft growth. Paradoxically, PC7 knockdowns reduced in vitro cellular proliferation but had no effect in vivo. Because PCs act within secretion pathways, we showed that conditioned media derived from PACE4 knockdown cells had very poor cell growth-stimulating effects in vitro. Immunohistochemistry of PACE4 knockdown tumors revealed reduced Ki67 and higher p27(KIP) levels (proliferation and cell cycle arrest markers, respectively). Interestingly, we determined that the epidermal growth factor receptor signaling pathway was activated in PC7 knockdown tumors only, providing some explanations of the paradoxical effects of PC7 silencing in prostate cancer cell lines. We conclude that PACE4 has a distinct role in maintaining proliferation and tumor progression in prostate cancer and this positions PACE4 as a relevant therapeutic target for this disease.""","""['Frédéric Couture', ""François D'Anjou"", 'Roxane Desjardins', 'François Boudreau', 'Robert Day']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Neoplasia""","""['Knockdown strategies for the study of proprotein convertases and proliferation in prostate cancer cells.', 'PACE4 is an important driver of ZR-75-1 estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer proliferation and tumor progression.', 'Pro-protein convertases (PCs) other than PC6 are not tightly regulated for implantation in the human endometrium.', 'The proprotein convertases furin and PACE4 play a significant role in tumor progression.', 'Proprotein convertases: ""master switches"" in the regulation of tumor growth and progression.', 'Cleavage of the V-ATPase associated prorenin receptor is mediated by PACE4 and is essential for growth of prostate cancer cells.', 'Identification of Genes Associated with Liver Metastasis in Pancreatic Cancer Reveals PCSK6 as a Crucial Mediator.', 'Efficacy of PACE4 pharmacotherapy in JHU-LNCaP-SM preclinical model of androgen independent prostate cancer.', 'Impact of COVID-19 on male urogenital health: Success of vaccines.', 'Proprotein Convertases and the Complement System.']"""

Methods:   Clinicopathologic data of 368 men who underwent radical prostatectomy between 2003 and 2011 at our institution were reviewed. The main interest of this study was to confirm that both isolated positive bladder neck margin and positive bladder neck margin associated with other surgical margin have more favorable biochemical outcomes than seminal vesicle invasion (pT3b).  Results:   The 3-year biochemical recurrence-free survival for men with organ confined disease, extraprostatic extension, isolated positive bladder neck margin, positive bladder neck margin with other surgical margin and seminal vesicle invasion was 88.9, 74.8, 51.2, 19.4 and 18.8%, respectively. On multivariate analysis, the increased risk of progression associated with an isolated positive bladder neck margin (hazard ratio 4.34, 95% confidence interval 1.40-13.46, P = 0.011) was less than that of seminal vesicle invasion (hazard ratio 9.67, 95% confidence interval 3.70-25.25, P < 0.001). As for the positive bladder neck margin with other surgical margin, the increased risk of progression (hazard ratio 9.32, 95% confidence interval 3.50-24.82, P < 0.001) was similar to that of men with seminal vesicle invasion.  Conclusions:   In our study, men with isolated positive bladder neck margin and positive bladder neck margin plus other surgical margin had no worse biochemical outcomes than those with seminal vesicle invasion (pT3b).

Cancer stage, initial treatment modalities, and the pattern of outpatient clinical management were reviewed.  Results:   Between 2006 and 2010, 386 prostate cancers were newly diagnosed at the institute. The proportion of localized and locally advanced cancer cases increased from 67% in 2006 to 79% in 2010 respectively.

In contrast, the proportion of hormone therapies decreased from 58% to 37%. For initial treatment choice, radical prostatectomy was chosen for 59% of the patients who were newly diagnosed with cancer during the study period. However, hormone therapy alone was administrated as a primary therapy to 26%. Analysis of the radical prostatectomy subgroup showed that a robot- assisted technique was used in 83% of the patients, and the remaining 17% underwent an open radical prostatectomy.

Methods:   The GLOBE study sent postal questionnaires to individuals in The Netherlands in 1991 resulting in 18 973 respondents (response 70%). Questions were asked on education, health and health-related behaviours. Participants were linked for cancer diagnosis (1991-2008), comorbidity and survival (up to 2010) with the population-based Eindhoven Cancer Registry; 1127 tumours were included in the analyses.  Results:   5-year crude survival was best in highly educated patients as compared with low educated patients for all cancers combined: 49% versus 32% in male subjects (log rank: p<0.0001), 65% versus 49% in female subjects (p=0.0001). Compared with highly educated, low educated prostate cancer patients had an increased risk of death (HR 2.9 (95% CI 1.7 to 5.1), adjusted for age, stage and year). No or inconsistent associations between educational level and risk of death were seen in multivariable analyses for breast, colon and non-small cell lung cancer. Although survival in prostate cancer patients was affected by comorbidities (HR2_vs_0_comorbidities: 2.6 (1.5 to 4.4)), physical activity (HRno/little_vs__moderate_physical__activity: 2.0 (1.2 to 3.4)) and smoking (HRcurrent_vs_never_smokers: 2.6 (1.0-6.8)), these did not contribute to educational inequalities in prostate cancer survival (HRlow_vs_high_education: 3.1 (1.6 to 5.8) with adjustment for comorbidity and lifestyle).  Conclusions:   Compared with low educated, highly educated prostate cancer patients had better survival. Although presence of comorbidities, physical activity levels and smoking status affected survival from prostate cancer, these did not contribute to educational inequalities in survival.

Patients and methods:   A total of 674 patients with needle biopsy-diagnosed GS6 PCa, who underwent radical prostatectomy (RP) between 1995 and 2011, were evaluated. Patients were stratified by preoperative PSA levels into low PSA (2-3,99 ng/ml) and an intermediate PSA of 4-10 ng/ml. Subsequently, the percentage of patients with extracapsular disease (pathological stage ≥pT3a) and/or positive surgical margins was determined among those whose RP GS was still 6 and compared to undergraded cases.  Results:   Out of 674 patients with needle biopsy-diagnosed GS6 PCa, 36.2% had no difference between biopsy and RP GS while 11.4% had been overgraded and 52.4% of patients were undergraded at biopsy. Stratified according to preoperative PSA levels, there was a significantly higher incidence of undergrading in the intermediate PSA group. Among those with ≥pT3a tumors, 74.1 % were undergraded in needle biopsy, out of which 67.7% had intermediate PSA levels and 32.3% low PSA levels. Among patients with R1 resections 75.1 % were underdiagnosed, out of which 75.9% had intermediate PSA levels. Stratifying these data according to preoperative PSA levels, ≥pT3a tumors and R1 resection were found significantly more often in the intermediate-PSA group.

However, several other clinical and experimental studies have suggested that α3β1 can possess anti-metastatic activity in certain settings. To help define the range of α3β1 functions in tumor cells in vivo, we used RNAi to silence the α3 integrin subunit in an aggressive, in vivo-passaged subline of PC-3 prostate carcinoma cells. Loss of α3 integrin impaired adhesion and proliferation on the α3β1 integrin ligand, laminin-332 in vitro. Despite these deficits in vitro, the α3-silenced cells were significantly more aggressive in a lung colonization model in vivo, with a substantially increased rate of tumor growth that significantly reduced survival. In contrast, silencing the related α6 integrin subunit delayed metastatic growth in vivo. The increased colonization of α3-silenced tumor cells in vivo was recapitulated in 3D collagen co-cultures with lung fibroblasts or pre-osteoblast-like cells, where α3-silenced cells showed dramatically enhanced growth. The increased response of α3-silenced tumor cells to stromal cells in co-culture could be reproduced by fibroblast conditioned medium, which contains one or more heparin-binding factors that selectively favor the growth of α3-silenced cells. Our new data suggest a scenario in which α3β1 regulates tumor-host interactions within the metastatic tumor microenvironment to limit growth, providing some of the first direct evidence that specific loss of α3 function in tumor cells can have pro-metastatic consequences in vivo.""","""['Afshin Varzavand', 'Justin M Drake', 'Robert U Svensson', 'Mary E Herndon', 'Bo Zhou', 'Michael D Henry', 'Christopher S Stipp']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Clin Exp Metastasis""","""['Comparative use of CRISPR and RNAi to modulate integrin α3β1 in triple negative breast cancer cells reveals that some pro-invasive/pro-metastatic α3β1 functions are independent of global regulation of the transcriptome.', 'Integrin α3β1 can function to promote spontaneous metastasis and lung colonization of invasive breast carcinoma.', 'Knockdown of cathepsin B and uPAR inhibits CD151 and α3β1 integrin-mediated cell adhesion and invasion in glioma.', 'Integrin α3β1 as a breast cancer target.', 'The role of stromal cells in the persistence of chronic inflammation.', 'The Emerging Role of Cell Adhesion Molecules on Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia.', 'A Novel Overall Survival Prediction Signature Based on Comprehensive Research in Prostate Cancer Bone Metastases.', 'Comparative use of CRISPR and RNAi to modulate integrin α3β1 in triple negative breast cancer cells reveals that some pro-invasive/pro-metastatic α3β1 functions are independent of global regulation of the transcriptome.', 'Integrin-associated CD151 is a suppressor of prostate cancer progression.', 'High-affinity peptide ligand LXY30 for targeting α3β1 integrin in non-small cell lung cancer.']"""

We examined associations of the adipokines leptin and adiponectin with the stage and grade of PSA-detected prostate cancer.  Methods:   We conducted a nested case-control study comparing 311 men with mainly locally advanced (≥T3, N1, or M1 cases) vs. 413 men with localized (T ≤2 & NX-0 & M0 controls) PSA-detected prostate cancer, recruited 2001-2009 from 9 UK regions to the ProtecT study. Associations of body mass index and adipokine levels with prostate cancer stage were determined by conditional logistic regression and with grade (Gleason score ≥7 vs. ≤6) by unconditional logistic regression.  Results:   Adiponectin was inversely associated with prostate cancer stage in overweight and obese men (OR 0.62; 95 % CI 0.42-0.90; p = 0.01), but not in normal weight men (OR 1.48; 0.77-2.82; p = 0.24) (p for interaction 0.007), or all men (OR 0.86; 0.66-1.11; p = 0.24).

However, the extent to which screening explains this association has not been well quantified.  Methods:   Within a Detroit area cohort of 6,692 men followed up after a benign prostate procedure, a case-control study was conducted of 494 PCa cases and controls matched on age, race, duration of follow-up, and date of initial benign finding; 2000 Census data were used in a principal component analysis to derive a single factor, labeled the neighborhood SES index (NSESI), representing zip code-level SES.  Results:   Among cases, higher SES was associated with a younger age at initial biopsy: -1.48 years (95 % CI, -2.32, -0.64) per unit NSESI. After adjustment for confounders and duration of follow-up, higher SES was associated with more PSA tests and DRE during follow-up; 9 % (95 % CI, 2, 16) and 8 % (95 % CI, 1, 15) more respectively, per unit NSESI. Higher SES was associated with a higher risk of PCa diagnosis during follow-up, multivariable adjusted OR = 1.26 per unit increase in NSESI (95 % CI, 1.04, 1.49). Further adjustment for screening frequency somewhat reduced the association between SES and PCa risk (OR = 1.19 per unit NSESI, 95 % CI, 0.98, 1.44).

Additionally, we demonstrate that LARGE2 (GYLTL1B), a gene not previously implicated in cancer, regulates functional αDG glycosylation in prostate cancer cell lines; knockdown of LARGE2 resulted in hypoglycosylation of αDG and loss of its ability to bind laminin-111 while overexpression restored ligand binding and diminished growth and migration of an aggressive prostate cancer cell line.

Results:   We identified 929 CanCORS/Medicare patients and 5298 HMO/CRN patients. Sensitivity, specificity, and PPV ranged widely depending on which codes were included and the type of cancer. For patients with lung, colorectal, and breast cancer, the combination of secondary malignant neoplasm and chemotherapy codes was the most sensitive (75%-85%); no code-set was highly sensitive and highly specific. For prostate cancer, no code-set offered even moderate sensitivity (≤ 19%).  Conclusions:   Secondary malignant neoplasm and chemotherapy codes could not identify recurrent cancer without some risk of misclassification. Findings based on existing algorithms should be interpreted with caution. More work is needed to develop a valid algorithm that can be used to characterize outcomes and define patient cohorts for comparative effectiveness research studies.""","""['Michael J Hassett', 'Debra P Ritzwoller', 'Nathan Taback', 'Nikki Carroll', 'Angel M Cronin', 'Gladys V Ting', 'Deb Schrag', 'Joan L Warren', 'Mark C Hornbrook', 'Jane C Weeks']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Med Care""","""['Detecting Lung and Colorectal Cancer Recurrence Using Structured Clinical/Administrative Data to Enable Outcomes Research and Population Health Management.', 'Limited validity of diagnosis codes in Medicare claims for identifying cancer metastases and inferring stage.', 'Validation of electronic data on chemotherapy and hormone therapy use in HMOs.', 'Influence of NCI cancer center attendance on mortality in lung, breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer patients.', 'Spending for Advanced Cancer Diagnoses: Comparing Recurrent Versus De Novo Stage IV Disease.', 'Racial and Ethnic Bias in Risk Prediction Models for Colorectal Cancer Recurrence When Race and Ethnicity Are Omitted as Predictors.', 'Machine Learning Algorithm to Estimate Distant Breast Cancer Recurrence at the Population Level with Administrative Data.', 'Economic Burden of Recurrence Among Resected Medicare Patients With Early Stage NSCLC.', 'A Validated Register-Based Algorithm to Identify Patients Diagnosed with Recurrence of Surgically Treated Stage I Lung Cancer in Denmark.', 'Estimating the incidence of breast cancer recurrence using administrative data.']"""

However, intraductal carcinoma exists on a morphologic continuum with high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) and distinguishing intraductal carcinoma from PIN is a common diagnostic dilemma with significant clinical implications. We evaluated whether immunostains for PTEN and ERG can sensitively identify intraductal carcinoma and accurately distinguish it from high-grade PIN. A combined immunostain for PTEN, ERG, p63 and CK903 was developed and validated. Radical prostatectomy specimens with lesions meeting criteria for intraductal carcinoma (n=45), intraductal cribriform proliferations falling short of intraductal carcinoma (n=15), and PIN lesions (n=39) were retrospectively identified and assessed for PTEN and ERG. Cytoplasmic PTEN loss was identified in 84% (38/45) of the intraductal carcinoma and 100% (15/15) of intraductal cribriform proliferation cases. In contrast, cytoplasmic PTEN loss was never observed in PIN (0/39; P<0.0001). Of the 53 cases of intraductal carcinoma or intraductal cribriform proliferation with cytoplasmic PTEN loss, it was homogeneously lost in 42 cases (79%). Weak, focal nuclear positivity for PTEN was retained in 31 of these 42 cases (74%). ERG expression was identified in 58% (26/45) of intraductal carcinoma and 67% (10/15) of intraductal cribriform proliferations compared with 13% (5/39) of PIN. Concordance between the PTEN/ERG status of the intraductal carcinoma lesions and the concurrent invasive carcinoma was high (>95% and P<0.0001 for each), and substantially less for PIN and the concurrent invasive tumor (83% for PTEN and 67% for ERG; P=NS for each). Cytoplasmic PTEN loss occurs in the majority of intraductal carcinoma and intraductal cribriform proliferation cases. Cytoplasmic PTEN loss was never observed in PIN (100% specificity). Our study identifies PTEN loss as a potentially useful marker to distinguish intraductal carcinoma from PIN and provides a plausible molecular explanation for why intraductal carcinoma is associated with poor prognosis.""","""['Tamara L Lotan', 'Berrak Gumuskaya', 'Hameed Rahimi', 'Jessica L Hicks', 'Tsuyoshi Iwata', 'Brian D Robinson', 'Jonathan I Epstein', 'Angelo M De Marzo']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Mod Pathol""","""['Utility of PTEN and ERG immunostaining for distinguishing high-grade PIN from intraductal carcinoma of the prostate on needle biopsy.', 'Atypical Intraductal Cribriform Proliferations of the Prostate Exhibit Similar Molecular and Clinicopathologic Characteristics as Intraductal Carcinoma of the Prostate.', 'ERG and PTEN status of isolated high-grade PIN occurring in cystoprostatectomy specimens without invasive prostatic adenocarcinoma.', 'High-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, PIN-like carcinoma, ductal carcinoma, and intraductal carcinoma of the prostate.', 'Premalignancy in Prostate Cancer: Rethinking What we Know.', 'Cribriform Patterned Lesions in the Prostate Gland with Emphasis on Differential Diagnosis and Clinical Significance.', 'Looking for a Simplified Diagnostic Model to Identify Potentially Lethal Cases of Prostate Cancer at Initial Diagnosis: An ImGO Pilot Study.', 'Intraductal Carcinoma of the Prostate as a Cause of Prostate Cancer Metastasis: A Molecular Portrait.', 'Identification of intraductal carcinoma of the prostate on tissue specimens using Raman micro-spectroscopy: A diagnostic accuracy case-control study with multicohort validation.', 'Intraductal carcinoma of the prostate.']"""

Notably, GPX3 hypermethylation and underexpression occur commonly in prostate, gastric, cervical, thyroid, and colon cancers. We took a reverse genetics approach to investigate whether GPX3 would augment inflammatory colonic tumorigenesis, a process characterized by oxidative stress and inflammation, comparing Gpx3(-/-) mice in an established two-stage model of inflammatory colon carcinogenesis. Gpx3-deficient mice exhibited an increased tumor number, though not size, along with a higher degree of dysplasia. In addition, they exhibited increased inflammation with redistribution toward protumorigenic M2 macrophage subsets, increased proliferation, hyperactive WNT signaling, and increased DNA damage. To determine the impact of acute gene loss in an established colon cancer line, we silenced GPX3 in human Caco2 cells, resulting in increased ROS production, DNA damage and apoptosis in response to oxidative stress, combined with decreased contact-independent growth.

We aimed to assess QoL differences in prostate cancer patients by stage and treatment for a population-based sample.  Methods:   The cross-sectional PCa patient population-based national level study for a prostate cancer patient population was performed. QoL was investigated with EORTC QLQ-C30. The analysis includes descriptive statistics and evaluation of differences in functional and symptom scales by stage and treatment group by predictors in the model.  Results:   Response rate was 79.1% (N=514). The highest QoL scores were observed in localised PCa, active surveillance treatment group. The lowest scores were observed in advanced stages, chemotherapy treatment group. Between cancer stages, statistically significant differences were observed only in scales of emotional functioning (p<0.001) and social functioning (p<0.001). Between treatment groups, statistically significant differences were observed in scales of physical functioning (p<0.001), role functioning (p<0.001), emotional functioning (p<0.001), and social functioning (p<0.001).  Conclusions:   Our study highlighted statistically significant differences in QoL between cancer stages and treatment.

We studied the expression of these CAMs in prostate cancer (PCa), high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN) and nodular adenomatous hyperplasia (NH).  Materials and methods:   135 paraffin blocks of radical prostatectomy specimens were assessed. CAMs were determined by immunohistochemistry. All sections included PCa, HGPIN and NH. The expression was semiquantitatively evaluated in three scores (1+, 2+, 3+). The markers' immunopositivity was statistically investigated with Gleason score and TNM stage.  Results and conclusions:   CD44s had score 3+ in 41.5, 46.7 and 37.8% of areas with NH, HGPIN and PCa, respectively. E-cadherin immunostaining was highly detected in 71.1, 78.5 and 63.0% of NH, HGPIN and PCa areas while β-catenin score 3+ was exclusively membranous in 80.7% of NH and nuclear/cytoplasmic in 70.4 and 48.9% of HGPIN and PCa areas. No marker related to the Gleason score (p = 0.352).

Methods:   Couples were recruited at the time the patient was first prescribed ADT and were randomized to a treatment or control group. Those in the treatment group were asked to read an educational guide and participate in an educational session designed to inform couples about possible ADT side effects and management strategies. To assess changes in the couples' relationships, they were administered the Dyadic Adjustment Scale and the Personal Assessment of Intimacy in Relationships questionnaire prior to randomization and again at 6 months.  Results:   While results were not statistically significant, trends and effect sizes suggest that the educational intervention helped attenuate declines in intimacy for patients, but not for their partners. Couples who participated in the intervention were more successful at maintaining sexual activity than were couples in the control group.  Conclusions:   ADT places considerable strain on intimate relationships, particularly for the partners. It appears that patients who receive help in anticipating and managing ADT related changes report better dyadic adjustment and closer intimacy.

Silencing OPG sensitized cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Interestingly, a positive correlation was noted between OPG production level and K-Ras mutation status. Earlier studies implicated K-Ras in conferring resistance to TRAIL-induced apoptosis in pancreatic cells and this study demonstrates that K-Ras mediated TRAIL resistance in pancreatic cancer cells occurs due to increased OPG production. Silencing K-Ras in pancreatic cancer cells decreased OPG levels and increased sensitivity to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. These observations indicate that OPG can play a role in both cell survival and in PDAC cell sensitivity to TRAIL-induced apoptosis, which may contribute to metastasis. Targeted inhibition of OPG binding to TRAIL may represent a therapeutic approach in the treatment of pancreatic cancer.""","""['Hirotaka Kanzaki', 'Akashi Ohtaki', 'Faisal K Merchant', 'Mark I Greene', 'Ramachandran Murali']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Exp Mol Pathol""","""['OPG is regulated by beta-catenin and mediates resistance to TRAIL-induced apoptosis in colon cancer.', 'Osteoprotegerin production by breast cancer cells is suppressed by dexamethasone and confers resistance against TRAIL-induced apoptosis.', 'Osteoprotegerin (OPG) expression by breast cancer cells in vitro and breast tumours in vivo--a role in tumour cell survival?', 'Role of full-length osteoprotegerin in tumor cell biology.', 'Pathophysiological roles of osteoprotegerin (OPG).', 'Bioinformatics Analysis of Immune Infiltration In Endometrial Carcinoma Tumors and its Relationship With Prognosis.', 'Co-Variation of Serum Osteoprotegerin and Pigment-Epithelial Derived Factor as Biomarker of Pancreatic Cancer.', 'LPS promotes resistance to TRAIL-induced apoptosis in pancreatic cancer.', 'Up-regulation of UHRF1 by oncogenic Ras promoted the growth, migration, and metastasis of pancreatic cancer cells.', 'Novel strategies for managing pancreatic cancer.']"""

Stromal-epithelial interactions are crucial for this development; however, the precise mechanisms by which epithelium responds to stromal cues remain unknown. We have previously reported ectopic expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ2 (PPARγ2) increased androgen receptor expression and promoted differentiation of mouse prostate epithelium. PPARγ is also implicated in urothelial differentiation. Herein we demonstrate that knockdown of PPARγ2 in benign human prostate epithelial cells (BHPrEs) promotes urothelial transdifferentiation. Furthermore, in vitro and in vivo heterotypic tissue regeneration models with embryonic bladder mesenchyme promoted urothelial differentiation of PPARγ2-deficient BHPrE cells, and deficiency of both PPARγ isoforms 1 and 2 arrested differentiation. Because PTEN deficiency is cooperative in urothelial pathogenesis, we engineered BHPrE cells with combined knockdown of PPARγ and PTEN and performed heterotypic recombination experiments using embryonic bladder mesenchyme. Whereas PTEN deficiency alone induced latent squamous differentiation in BHPrE cells, combined PPARγ and PTEN deficiency accelerated the development of keratinizing squamous metaplasia (KSM). We further confirmed via immunohistochemistry that gene expression changes in metaplastic recombinants reflected human urothelium undergoing KSM. In summary, these data suggest that PPARγ isoform expression provides a molecular basis for observations that adult human epithelium can be transdifferentiated on the basis of heterotypic mesenchymal induction. These data also implicate PPARγ and PTEN inactivation in the development of KSM.""","""['Douglas W Strand', 'David J DeGraff', 'Ming Jiang', 'Mansoureh Sameni', 'Omar E Franco', 'Harold D Love', 'William J Hayward', 'Opal Lin-Tsai', 'Anne Y Wang', 'Justin M M Cates', 'Bonnie F Sloane', 'Robert J Matusik', 'Simon W Hayward']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Am J Pathol""","""['Plasticity of the urothelial phenotype: effects of gastro-intestinal mesenchyme/stroma and implications for urinary tract reconstruction.', 'Alterations of mTOR and PTEN protein expression in schistosomal squamous cell carcinoma and urothelial carcinoma.', 'Disruption of PPARgamma signaling results in mouse prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia involving active autophagy.', 'Autophagy in nuclear receptor PPARgamma-deficient mouse prostatic carcinogenesis.', 'Development, validation and implementation of an in vitro model for the study of metabolic and immune function in normal and inflamed human colonic epithelium.', 'Glucocorticoids are induced while dihydrotestosterone levels are suppressed in 5-alpha reductase inhibitor treated human benign prostate hyperplasia patients.', 'The role and function of PPARγ in bladder cancer.', 'Repression of transcription factor AP-2 alpha by PPARγ reveals a novel transcriptional circuit in basal-squamous bladder cancer.', 'Heterogeneity of PTEN and PPAR-γ in cancer and their prognostic application to bladder cancer.', 'Differential transcription factor expression by human epithelial cells of buccal and urothelial derivation.']"""

In this context we determined whether quality of life and prediction instruments for prostate cancer have been adopted by radiation oncologists and urologists in the United States.  Materials and methods:   Using a nationally representative mail survey of 1,422 prostate cancer specialists in the United States, we queried about self-reported clinical implementation of quality of life instruments, prostate cancer nomograms and life expectancy prediction tools in late 2011. The Pearson chi-square test and multivariate logistic regression were used to determine differences in the use of each instrument by physician characteristics.  Results:   A total of 313 radiation oncologists and 328 urologists completed the survey for a 45% response rate. Although 55% of respondents reported using prostate cancer nomograms, only 27% and 23% reported using quality of life and life expectancy prediction instruments, respectively. On multivariate analysis urologists were less likely to use quality of life instruments than radiation oncologists (OR 0.40, p <0.001). Physicians who spent 30 minutes or more counseling patients were consistently more likely to use quality of life instruments (OR 2.57, p <0.001), prostate cancer nomograms (OR 1.83, p = 0.009) and life expectancy prediction tools (OR 1.85, p = 0.02) than those who spent less than 15 minutes.

Materials and methods:   We analyzed case logs from 2004 to 2010 for trends and used logistic regression models to assess the impact of surgeon age on endoscopic surgery use.  Results:   A total of 3,955 urologists included at least 1 endoscopic surgical management in the case logs, while 2,334 (59%) exclusively performed electrosurgical transurethral resection of the prostate and 309 (8%) exclusively performed laser vaporization or laser enucleation. We observed a large increase in the number and proportion of laser procedures from 11% in 2004 to 44% in 2010. Although there was no difference in median age between urologists who performed exclusively electrosurgical transurethral resection and those who performed laser procedures, the latter had a substantially higher case volume. Older urologists were significantly less likely to perform laser vaporization or enucleation when undergoing the second recertification (OR 0.56/10 years of age, 95% CI 0.36-0.87, p = 0.009), but not the initial certification.  Conclusions:   There was a substantial increase in laser vaporization or laser enucleation procedures performed by urologists who underwent board certification or recertification in 2004 to 2010.

These observations partially explain the failure of current androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) to reduce/prevent androgen binding to AR in every cell. Herein, we identified the AR degradation enhancer ASC-J9, which selectively degrades AR protein via interruption of the AR-AR selective coregulator interaction. Such selective interruption could, therefore, suppress AR-mediated PCa growth in the androgen-sensitive stage before ADT and in the castration-resistant stage after ADT. Mechanistic dissection suggested that ASC-J9 could activate the proteasome-dependent pathway to promote AR degradation through the enhanced association of AR-Mdm2 complex. The consequences of ASC-J9-promoted AR degradation included reduced androgen binding to AR, AR N-C terminal interaction, and AR nuclear translocation. Such inhibitory regulation could then result in suppression of AR transactivation and AR-mediated cell growth in eight different mouse models, including intact or castrated nude mice xenografted with androgen-sensitive LNCaP cells or androgen-insensitive C81 cells and castrated nude mice xenografted with castration-resistant C4-2 and CWR22Rv1 cells, and TRAMP and Pten(+/-) mice.

We then applied an acinar morphogenesis-specific gene profile to two independent cohorts of patients with PCA (total n = 79) and found that those with tumors expressing this profile, which we designated acini-like tumors, had a significantly lower risk of postoperative relapse compared with those tumors with a lower correlation (hazard ratio, 0.078; log-rank test P = 0.009).

Purpose:   The purpose of the present study was to investigate the angiographic appearance of a variety of spinal tumors, assess the safety and efficacy of preoperative embolization in relation to the amount of intraoperative blood loss, and correlate intraoperative tumor histology with the degree of gadolinium enhancement on spinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and tumor vascularity visualized during angiography.  Study design/setting:   Retrospective and single-institution cohort study.  Patient sample:   One hundred four patients with spinal tumors referred for preoperative embolization.  Outcome measures:   Effectiveness of preoperative embolization in relation to intraoperative blood loss and number of transfused packed red blood cell units in perioperative period (72 hours).  Methods:   From 2000 to 2009, 104 patients with spinal tumors underwent 114 spinal angiographies with the intent to embolize feeder vessels before surgery. The effectiveness of embolization was compared with the documented intraoperative blood loss. Angiographic tumor vascularity was graded from 0 (avascular) to 3 (highly vascular). Ninety-four patients had a pre- and post-gadolinium-enhanced MRI of the spine before transarterial embolization. Magnetic resonance imaging vascular enhancement was classified as Grade 3 (avid contrast enhancement), Grade 2 (moderate), or Grade 1 (mild).  Results:   Transarterial tumor embolization was angiographically complete in 63 (66%) and partial in 33 procedures (34%). In 18 cases, the target was not deemed suitable for embolization. A limited statistical analysis did not reveal a statistical difference in documented intraoperative blood loss between patients with complete versus partial embolization for the entire cohort or when stratified into renal cell carcinoma (RCC; p=.64), multiple myeloma (p=.28), malignant (p=.17) and benign tumor groups (p=.26). There were no clinical complications associated with embolization. There was poor correlation between MRI enhancement and angiographic vascularity.  Conclusions:   Preoperative embolization was angiographically effective in most cases. Avid gadolinium enhancement (Grade 3) on MRI was not predictive of hypervascularity on angiography. Furthermore, hypervascularity was not restricted to classically vascular tumors, such as RCC, as it was noted in some patients with breast and prostate cancer.

Results:   Intravesical FDG activity significantly decreased in 90% of the patients with forced diuresis protocol. Eighty eight percent of the bladder findings and 20% of the local lymph node metastases, and other pelvic findings (local invasion and second primary malignancy of prostate) were detected only by the additional pelvic PET/CT images.

Design, setting and subjects:   The clinical data and histopathology reports of men seen from January 1999 through March 2009 at our institution were analysed using Student's t-test, the Mann-Whitney test and Fisher's exact test where appropriate. Values were expressed as means, medians and ranges (p<0.05 accepted as statistically significant).  Outcome measures:   Data collected included patient age, duration of lower urinary tract symptoms and hospitalisation, findings on digital rectal examination, prostate volume, haemoglobin concentration, serum creatinine and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, and histological findings.  Results:   Prostatic tissue of 385 men without urinary retention at presentation was obtained via biopsy (48.3% of cases), transurethral prostatectomy (62.9%), retropubic prostatectomy (6.8%) or radical prostatectomy (28.3%). On histological examination, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) was found to be present in 213 patients (55.3%) and adenocarcinoma of the prostate (ACP) in 172 (44.7%). Histological prostatitis was present in 130 patients (61.0%) with BPH and 51 (29.7%) with ACP (p<0.001). A previous study of 405 men presenting with urinary retention at our institution showed histological prostatitis in 98/204 (48.0%) with BPH and in 51/201 (25.4%) with ACP. The group of men with BPH alone had a significantly lower mean serum PSA at presentation (4.5 ng/ml, range 0.3 - 20.8 ng/ml) compared with the group with BPH and prostatitis (11.2 ng/ml, range 0.2 - 145 ng/ml, p=0.011). The mean PSA level at presentation did not differ significantly between the group with ACP only (40.9 ng/ml, range 0 - 255 ng/ml) and the group with ACP plus prostatitis (1 672 ng/ml, range 0.3 - 38 169 ng/ml, p=0.076).  Conclusions:   Among men presenting without urinary retention, histological prostatitis was significantly more prevalent in those with BPH than in those with ACP (61% v. 30%), similar to the previous study of men presenting with retention at our institution, in which histological prostatitis was significantly more prevalent in BPH than in ACP (48% v. 25%). This finding suggests that histological prostatitis is not significantly associated with the causation of ACP or urinary retention. Serum PSA at presentation was significantly higher in the group with BPH plus prostatitis compared with BPH alone, but not in the group with ACP plus prostatitis compared with ACP alone.""","""['Rachel S Edlin', 'Chris F Heyns', 'Stephan P J Van Vuuren', 'Amir D Zarrabi']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""S Afr J Surg""","""['Significance of histological prostatitis in patients with urinary retention and underlying benign prostatic hyperplasia or adenocarcinoma of the prostate.', 'Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and prostatitis: prevalence of painful ejaculation in men with clinical BPH.', 'Calculated fast-growing benign prostatic hyperplasia--a risk factor for developing clinical prostate cancer.', 'Is screening for prostate cancer necessary in men with symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia?', 'The role of chronic prostatic inflammation in the pathogenesis and progression of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).', 'Bacteriological Profile of Isolates From Urine Samples in Patients of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia and or Prostatitis Showing Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms.', 'Prostate cancer incidence in men with self-reported prostatitis after 15 years of follow-up.', 'The relationship between histological prostatitis and lower urinary tract symptoms and sexual function.', 'Therapeutic efficacy of Cernilton in benign prostatic hyperplasia patients with histological prostatitis after transurethral resection of the prostate.']"""

One-hundred-four consecutive men with a normal digital rectal examination and a serum PSA level of 2.5-10 ng/ml underwent transrectal ultrasonography-guided biopsy using a 10-core scheme. The sTT level was determined before the procedure using a chemiluminescent assay, and the ratio of sTT to PSA (sTT/PSA) was calculated after transforming sTT measurements from ng/dL to ng/mL. The overall cancer detection rate was 17.3%. The median sTT level was 332 ng/dl in men with cancer and 413 ng/dL in those without (p = 0.032). The median sTT/PSA ratio in these groups was 0.55 and 0.74, respectively (p = 0.035). The receiver operator characteristic (ROC) method was used to evaluate the properties of the sTT/PSA ratio, with testosterone and PSA as predictors of prostate cancer risk. The accuracy of the sTT/PSA ratio in prostate cancer diagnosis, represented by the area under the curve (AUC), was 0.739 (95% CI 0.640-0.823, p < 0.05). Optimizing the sensitivity and specificity of the sTT/PSA ratio using the ROC provided a cutoff point of 0.60, which corresponded to 82% sensitivity and 62% specificity. When the patients were divided into normal- and low-sTT level groups according to testosterone value (300 ng/dl), the probability of detecting prostate cancer was 3.3-fold higher in hypogonadal men as compared with eugonadal men.

Detailed characteristics of the tumor are still unclear due to its rarity.We describe a case of prostatic stromal sarcoma in a 63 year-old man who suffered from urinary obstructive symptoms. Palliative transuterine resection was performed and the preliminary histopathological diagnosis was neuroendocrine carcinoma. After chemotherapy, total pelvic exenteration was performed. Histopathologically, the tumor was composed of monotonously proliferating small to medium-sized round cells, which existed in compact islands with loose or dense fibrovascular networks. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells were widely positive for vimentin, CD56, CD99 and focally positive for synaptophysin, CD10, progesterone receptor, desmin and CD34, but negative for EMA, cytokeratin, estrogen receptor, S-100 and myoglobin. Most of the previously reported tumors exhibited positive stainability for CD10 and progesterone receptor. In addition to these markers, expressions of CD56, CD99 and synaptophysin were characteristically detected in our case. To the best of our knowledge, we present the first case of prostatic stromal sarcoma with characteristic immunohistochemical staining properties. Although the biological characteristics of this rare tumor have not yet been elucidated, these findings suggest prostatic stromal sarcoma can potentially show neuroectodermal differentiation.

Recent studies reported that SPOP may be a tumor suppressor gene (TSG) and somatic mutation of SPOP was detected in prostate cancer (PCA). The aim of this study was to see whether alterations of SPOP protein expression and somatic mutation of SPOP gene are features of cancers. In this study, we analyzed SPOP somatic mutation in 45 gastric (GC), 45 colorectal cancer (CRC) and 45 PCA by single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP). Also, we analyzed SPOP protein expression in 60 GC, 60 CRC and 60 PCA by immunohistochemistry. Overall, we detected three somatic missense mutations of SPOP gene in the coding sequences (p.Ser14Leu, p.Tyr87Cys and p.Phe133Leu). The mutations were observed in two PCA and one CRC. Of note, the p.Phe133Leu was a recurrent mutation reported in an earlier study. In the immunohistochemistry, SPOP protein was expressed in normal gastric, colonic and prostate epithelial cells, whereas it was lost in 30% of GC, 20% of CRC and 37% of PCA. Our data indicate that loss of SPOP expression was common in GC, CRC and PCA, but somatic mutation of SPOP in this study was rare in these tumors.

Methods:   We performed RRP for 100 patients with prostate cancer, 50 (group A) with the Walsh or Poor method for handling the dorsal venous complex (DVC), and the other 50 (group B) through the following three additional procedures for hemostasis: first placing a #7 prophylactic suture in the distal position of DVC, then ligating the vascular bundle of the prostatic apex with continuous 4-0 Vicryl sutures, and lastly placing a 4-0 absorbable suture followed by freeing the neurovascular bundle (NVB) or freeing NVB before suturing the remained levator ani myofascia and the deep layer of Denovilliers' fascia above the rectal serosa with 4-0 Vicryl.

We also investigated if urologists assessed health related quality of life more accurately in the short or long term.  Materials and methods:   We identified 1,366 men from CaPSURE™, a national, prospective cohort, who had undergone prostatectomy, brachytherapy or external beam radiation therapy. At each visit urologists assessed fatigue, pain, and sexual, urinary and bowel dysfunction. Participants independently completed the SF-36™ and the UCLA-PCI. We contrasted the frequency of impairment reported by physicians and participants in select health related quality of life domains in the short (less than 1 year) and long (greater than 2 years) term. We also compared physician-patient concordance between the periods 1995 to 2000 and 2001 to 2007.  Results:   In short-term and long-term followup, and for the 1995 to 2000 and 2001 to 2007 cohorts, physician and participant assessments differed in all analyzed domains. Urologists noted impairment in urinary and sexual function more often than fatigue or pain. Disagreement between physician and participant ratings did not vary dramatically from short-term to long-term followup, or from the earlier to the later cohort.

In a multicenter retrospective study we evaluated the actuarial rates and predictors of remaining on active surveillance, the incidence of cancer progression and the pathological findings of delayed radical prostatectomy.  Materials and methods:   A cohort of 262 men from 4 institutions met the inclusion criteria of age 75 years or younger, prostate specific antigen 10 ng/ml or less, clinical stage T1-T2a, biopsy Gleason sum 6 or less, 3 or less positive cores at diagnostic biopsy, repeat biopsy before active surveillance and no treatment for 6 months following the repeat biopsy. Active surveillance started on the date of the second biopsy. Actuarial rates of remaining on active surveillance were calculated and univariate Cox regression was used to assess predictors of discontinuing active surveillance.  Results:   With a median followup of 29 months 43 patients ultimately received active treatment. The 2 and 5-year probabilities of remaining on active surveillance were 91% and 75%, respectively. Patients with cancer on the second biopsy (HR 2.23, 95% CI 1.23-4.06, p = 0.007) and a higher number of cancerous cores from the 2 biopsies combined (p = 0.002) were more likely to undergo treatment. Age, prostate specific antigen, clinical stage, prostate volume and number of total biopsy cores sampled were not predictive of outcome. Skeletal metastases developed in 1 patient 38 months after starting active surveillance. Of the 43 patients undergoing delayed treatment 41 (95%) are without disease progression at a median of 23 months following treatment.  Conclusions:   With a median followup of 29 months active surveillance for select patients appears to be safe and associated with a low risk of systemic progression.

Several studies have demonstrated the gram-positive bacterium Propionibacterium acnes to be frequently present in prostate tissue from men suffering from prostate disease. P. acnes has been shown to be associated with histological inflammation in human prostatectomy specimens, and also to induce strong inflammatory response in prostate-derived tissue culture models. The present paper describes a rat model for assessment of the pathogenic potential of P. acnes in prostate. Prostate glands of Sprague Dawley rats (n = 98) were exposed via an abdominal incision and live P. acnes or, in control rats, saline were injected into the ventral and dorso-lateral lobes. Rats were sacrificed 5 days, 3 weeks, 3 months and 6 months post infection, and prostate tissue was analyzed for bacterial content and histological inflammation. Rat sera were assessed for levels of CRP and anti-P. acnes IgG. Live P. acnes could be recovered from the dorso-lateral lobes up to 3 months post infection, while the ventral lobes were cleared from bacteria at that time. In samples up to 3 months post infection, the dorso-lateral lobes exhibited intense focal inflammation. CRP and IgG levels were elevated throughout the span of the experiment, and reached maximum levels 3 weeks and 3 months post infection, respectively.

Deregulation of APC/C is frequently observed in cancer cells and is suggested to contribute to chromosome instability and cancer predisposition. In this study, we identified Daxx as a novel APC/C inhibitor frequently overexpressed in prostate cancer. Daxx interacts with the APC/C coactivators Cdc20 and Cdh1 in vivo, with the binding of Cdc20 dependent on the consensus destruction boxes near the N-terminal of the Daxx protein. Ectopic expression of Daxx, but not the D-box deleted mutant (DaxxΔD-box), inhibited the degradation of APC/Cdc20 and APC/Cdh1 substrates, leading to a transient delay in mitotic progression. Daxx is frequently upregulated in prostate cancer tissues; the expression level positively correlated with the Gleason score and disease metastasis (P = 0.027 and 0.032, respectively). Furthermore, ectopic expression of Daxx in a non-malignant prostate epithelial cell line induced polyploidy under mitotic stress.

Methods:   A retrospective cohort study was conducted using data from record linkage of administrative databases (pharmaceutical prescription data, hospital discharge records, Italian population registry). Men aged ≥ 40 years old who had received a prescription for at least 10 packs/year between January 1, 2004 and December 31, 2004 were included and followed for 5 years. The association of the outcomes was assessed using a multiple Cox proportional hazard model. Propensity score-matched analysis and a 5-1, greedy 1:1 matching algorithm were performed.  Results:   8,132 patients were identified. Overall incidence rates of BPH hospitalization and BPH-related surgery were 21.05 (95 % CI 19.52-22.71) and 20.97 (95 % CI 19.45-22.61) per 1,000 person-years, respectively. In the dutasteride group compared with finasteride group, the incidence rate of both events was statistically significant lower: 16.07 versus 21.76 for BPH hospitalization and 15.91 versus 21.69 for BPH-related surgery. The incidence rate of new PCa was also lower for the dutasteride group [8.34 (95 % CI 5.96-11.68) vs. 10.25 (95 % CI 9.15-11.49)]. Dutasteride was associated with a reduction in BPH-related hospitalizations (HR 0.75, 95 % CI 0.58-0.98 and 0.58-0.98 for surgical and non-surgical reasons). The matched analysis confirmed the risk reduction with dutasteride for BPH-related surgery.

The progression and invasion of PCa are normally mediated by the overexpression of chemokine receptors (CKRs) and the interaction between CKRs and their cognate ligands. We recently demonstrated that venom extracted from Walterinnesia aegyptia (WEV) either alone or in combination with silica nanoparticles (WEV+NP) mediated the growth arrest and apoptosis of breast cancer cells. In the present study, we evaluated the impact of WEV alone and WEV+NP on the migration, invasion, proliferation and apoptosis of prostate cancer cells. We found that WEV alone and WEV+NP decreased the viability of all cell types tested (PCa cells isolated from patient samples, PC3 cells and LNCaP cells) using an MTT assay. The IC(50) values were determined to be 10 and 5 μg/mL for WEV alone and WEV+NP, respectively. WEV+NP decreased the surface expression of the CKRs CXCR3, CXCR4, CXCR5 and CXCR6 to a greater extent than WEV alone and subsequently reduced migration and the invasion response of the cells to the cognate ligands of the CKRs (CXCL10, CXCL12, CXCL13 and CXCL16, respectively). Using a CFSE proliferation assay, we found that WEV+NP strongly inhibited epidermal growth factor-mediated PCa cell proliferation. Furthermore, analysis of the cell cycle indicated that WEV+NP strongly altered the cell cycle of PCa cells and enhanced the induction of apoptosis. Finally, we demonstrated that WEV+NP robustly decreased the expression of anti-apoptotic effectors, such as B cell Lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), B cell Lymphoma-extra large (Bcl-(XL)) and myeloid cell leukemia sequence-1 (Mcl-1), and increased the expression of pro-apoptotic effectors, such as Bcl-2 homologous antagonist/killer (Bak), Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) and Bcl-2-interacting mediator of cell death (Bim). WEV+NP also altered the membrane potential of mitochondria in the PCa cells.

The expression of endogenous GH in prostate cancer cell lines has also been observed, suggesting the potential for an effect of autocrine GH. In the present study, we measure the levels of GH and GH receptor (GHR) mRNA in multiple prostate cancer and normal prostate-derived cell lines, and compare the effects of exogenous and autocrine GH on LNCaP prostate cancer cell proliferation and apoptosis, and the associated signal transduction pathways. We found that GHR and GH expression were higher in the prostate cancer cell lines, and that exogenous GH increased LNCaP cell proliferation, but had no effect on apoptosis. In contrast, autocrine GH overexpression reduced LNCaP cell proliferation and increased apoptosis. The distinct actions of exogenous and autocrine GH were accompanied by differences in the involvement of GHR-associated signal transduction pathways, and were paralleled by an alteration in the subcellular localization of GHR, in which autocrine GH appeared to sequester GHR in the Golgi and endoplasmic reticulum. This alteration of GHR trafficking may underlie a distinct mode of GH-mediated signaling associated with the effect of autocrine GH. These findings clarify the potential effects of GH on prostate cancer cell function, and indicate that the activity of autocrine GH may be distinct from that of endocrine GH in prostate cancer cells.""","""['Alona O Nakonechnaya', 'Holly S Jefferson', 'Xiaofei Chen', 'Brian M Shewchuk']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Cell Biochem""","""['Growth hormone (GH) receptors in prostate cancer: gene expression in human tissues and cell lines and characterization, GH signaling and androgen receptor regulation in LNCaP cells.', 'Regulation of growth hormone receptors in human prostate cancer cell lines.', 'Growth hormone affects gene expression and proliferation in human prostate cancer cells.', 'Morphogenic and tumorigenic potentials of the mammary growth hormone/growth hormone receptor system.', 'GH and GHR signaling in human disease.', 'Exogenous growth hormone promotes an epithelial-mesenchymal hybrid phenotype in cancerous HeLa cells but not in non-cancerous HEK293 cells.', 'GH Action in Prostate Cancer Cells Promotes Proliferation, Limits Apoptosis, and Regulates Cancer-related Gene Expression.', 'Second-Generation Jak2 Inhibitors for Advanced Prostate Cancer: Are We Ready for Clinical Development?', 'Emergent Coordination of the CHKB and CPT1B Genes in Eutherian Mammals: Implications for the Origin of Brown Adipose Tissue.', 'Why Should Growth Hormone (GH) Be Considered a Promising Therapeutic Agent for Arteriogenesis?

Matriptase-2 is a member of the TTSP family and has been shown to have a key role in cancer progression. The role of matriptase-2 in angiogenesis and angiogenesis-related cancer progression is currently poorly understood. This study aims to elucidate the role of matriptase-2 in tumour angiogenesis. Matriptase-2 was over-expressed in human vascular endothelial cells, HECV, using a mammalian expression plasmid. The altered cells were used in a number of in vitro and in vivo assays designed to investigate the involvement of matriptase-2 in angiogenesis. Over-expression had no significant effect on the growth and adhesion of HECV cells. However, there was a significant reduction in the motility of the cells and their ability to form tubules in an artificial basement membrane (p < 0.01 for both). HECV(mat2 exp) cells inoculated into CD-1 athymic mice along with either PC-3 prostate cancer cells or MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells showed a dramatic decrease in tumour development and growth in the prostate tumours (p < 0.01) and a lesser, non-significant, decrease in the breast tumours (p = 0.08). Over-expression of matriptase-2 also decreased urokinase type plasminogen activator total protein levels in HECV and prostate cells. The study concludes that matriptase-2 has the ability to suppress the angiogenic nature of HECV cells in vitro and in vivo. It also suggests that matriptase-2 could have a potential role in prostate and breast tumour suppression through its anti-angiogenic properties.""","""['Siobhan L Webb', 'Andrew J Sanders', 'Malcolm D Mason', 'Wen G Jiang']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Mol Cell Biochem""","""['The influence of matriptase-2 on prostate cancer in vitro: a possible role for β-catenin.', 'Matriptase-2 inhibits breast tumor growth and invasion and correlates with favorable prognosis for breast cancer patients.', 'Genetic upregulation of matriptase-2 reduces the aggressiveness of prostate cancer cells in vitro and in vivo and affects FAK and paxillin localisation.', 'The type II transmembrane serine protease, matriptase-2: Possible links to cancer?', 'Matriptase-2 (TMPRSS6): a proteolytic regulator of iron homeostasis.', 'Impact of pigment epithelium-derived factor on colorectal cancer in vitro and in vivo.', 'Membrane-anchored proteases in endothelial cell biology.', 'TMPRSS3 is a novel poor prognostic factor for breast cancer.', 'Liposome encapsulated Disulfiram inhibits NFκB pathway and targets breast cancer stem cells in vitro and in vivo.']"""

This underscores the urgent need to develop novel anti-PC therapies. Vernonia amygdalina (VA) could be one such candidate agent. We have shown that androgen-independent PC-3 cells are sensitive to VA treatment in vitro. VA extract (0.01, 0.1 and 1 mg/ml) inhibited DNA synthesis by 12%, 45% (p<0.05), and 73% (p<0.01) respectively. In contrast, TAX (0.01, 0.1, and 1 μM) failed to significantly affect cell growth, suggesting TAX resistance. We tested molecular mechanisms which may lend to the observed PC-3 cell VA sensitivity/TAX resistance. Though both VA and TAX stimulated MAPK activity, VA's induction was more intense, but transient, compared to TAX's sustained action. NF-κB activation was inhibited on average by 50% by either 1 mg/ml VA or 1 μM TAX. VA extract caused 35% and 45% increases in c-Myc activity at 10 and 60 min intervals respectively, with the highest stimulation attained 1h after treatment. In contrast, similar levels were attained by TAX rapidly (within 5 min) and were sustained compared to the slow/multi-phasic action of VA. VA extract treatments had no effect on AKT gene expression, while TAX treatments yielded a four-fold (P<0.01) increase; and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) activity was inhibited by VA and stimulated by TAX, compared to control (basal ATPase activity). This study shows that TAX-resistant PC-3 cells are sensitive to VA, perhaps explained by differential regulatory patterns of MAPK, c-Myc, AKT, and Pgp activities/expressions.""","""['Keyuna S Cameron', 'Carolyn B Howard', 'Ernest B Izevbigie', 'Brandon J Hill', 'Paul B Tchounwou']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Exp Toxicol Pathol""","""['Vernonia amygdalina: anticancer activity, authentication, and adulteration detection.', 'In vitro anti-prostate cancer and ex vivo antiangiogenic activity of Vernonia guineensis Benth.

Comorbidities may be important, and previous studies have indicated elevated second cancer risk after initial primary thyroid cancers. This study examined the risk of second cancers after development of a thyroid cancer, primary utilizing the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program database.  Methods:   The cohort consisted of men and women diagnosed with first primary thyroid cancer who were reported to a SEER database in 1973-2008 (n=52,103). Standardized incidence ratios (SIR) were calculated for all secondary cancers. Confidence intervals and p-values are at 0.05 significance alpha level and are two-sided based on Poisson exact methods.  Results:   In this cohort, 4457 individuals developed second cancers. The risk of developing second cancers after a primary thyroid cancer varied from 10% to 150% depending on different cancer types. Cancers in all sites, breast, skin, prostate, kidney, brain, salivary gland, second thyroid, lymphoma, myeloma, and leukemia were elevated. The magnitude of the risk varied by histology, tumor size, calendar year of first primary thyroid cancer diagnosis, and the treatment of the primary thyroid cancer. The risk of a second cancer was elevated in patients whose first primary thyroid carcinomas were small, or were diagnosed after 1994, or in whom some form of radiation treatment was administered.  Conclusions:   This large population-based analysis of second cancers among thyroid cancer patients suggests that there was an increase of second cancers in all sites, and the most commonly elevated second cancers were the salivary gland and kidney. Additionally, the increase in second cancers in patients with recently diagnosed thyroid microcarcinomas (<10 mm) suggests that aggressive radiation treatment of the first primary thyroid cancer, the environment, and genetic susceptibility, may increase the risk of a second cancer.""","""['Christopher Kim', 'Xiaofeng Bi', 'Dongsheng Pan', 'Yingtai Chen', 'Tobias Carling', 'Shuangge Ma', 'Robert Udelsman', 'Yawei Zhang']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Thyroid""","""['Links between Breast and Thyroid Cancer: Hormones, Genetic Susceptibility and Medical Interventions.', 'Second primaries after major salivary gland cancer.', 'Increased risk of second primary malignancy in pediatric and young adult patients treated with radioactive iodine for differentiated thyroid cancer.', 'Italian cancer figures, report 2013: Multiple tumours.', 'Risk of second primary malignancies following cutaneous melanoma diagnosis: a population-based study.', 'Risk prediction of second primary malignant tumor in primary differentiated thyroid cancer patients: a population-based study.', 'Sexual disparity and the risk of second primary thyroid cancer: a paradox.', 'Follow, consider, and catch: second primary tumors in acromegaly patients.', 'Links between Breast and Thyroid Cancer: Hormones, Genetic Susceptibility and Medical Interventions.', 'Breast cancer risk among thyroid cancer survivors and the role of I-131 treatment.']"""

Methods and materials:   Men treated for prostate cancer with radiation therapy at the Sahlgrenska University Hospital in Göteborg, Sweden from 1993 to 2006 were approached with a study-specific postal questionnaire addressing symptoms after treatment, including urethral burning pain during urination (n=985). The men had received primary or salvage external-beam radiation therapy (EBRT) or EBRT in combination with brachytherapy (BT). Prescribed doses were commonly 70 Gy in 2.0-Gy fractions for primary and salvage EBRT and 50 Gy plus 2×10.0 Gy for EBRT+BT. Prostatic urethral doses were assessed from treatment records. We also recruited 350 non-pelvic-irradiated, population-based controls matched for age and residency to provide symptom background rates.  Results:   Of the treated men, 16% (137 of 863) reported urethral pain, compared with 11% (27 of 242) of the controls. The median time to follow-up was 5.2 years (range, 1.1-14.3 years). Prostatic urethral doses were similar to prescription doses for EBRT and 100% to 115% for BT. Fractionation-corrected dose and time to follow-up affected the occurrence of the symptom. For a follow-up≥3 years, 19% of men (52 of 268) within the 70-Gy EBRT+BT group reported pain, compared with 10% of men (23 of 222) treated with 70 Gy primary EBRT (prevalence ratio 1.9; 95% confidence interval 1.2-3.0). Of the men treated with salvage EBRT, 10% (20 of 197) reported urethral pain.  Conclusions:   Survivors treated with EBRT+BT had a higher risk for urethral pain compared with those treated with EBRT.

CT and T2-weighed MRI images with 3 mm slice thickness were acquired for 13 patients with clinically organ-confined prostate cancer. Target volumes were contoured by two clinicians (""AP"" and ""SZ"") experienced in prostate radiotherapy. Two clinical target volumes were defined: prostate (CTVpros) and prostate with a margin including the proximal 1 cm of the seminal vesicles (CTVpvs). Eight clinical target volumes were outlined for all patients: CTVprosAPCT, CTVprosAPMR, CTVpvsAPCT, CTVpvsAPMR, CTVprosSZCT, CTVprosSZMR, CTVpvsSZCT, CTVpvsSZMR. Volumes were measured in cm3. The volumes of different PTVs were compared using the Student's t-test. Mean CTVpros and CTVpvs using CT vs. MRI were 36.9 (range:13.8-121) vs. 32.0 (9.7-120.1) (p=0.0002), and 77.2 (30.5-209.5) vs. 67.6 (29.8-191.1) (p=0.0001), respectively. Mean CTVprosAPCT vs. CTVprosAPMR were 39.2 vs. 32.0 (p<0.00005), respectively. Mean CTVprosSZCT vs. CTVprosSZMR were 34.6 vs. 31.9 (p=0.15). Mean CTVpvsAPCT vs. CTVpvsAPMR were 85.8 vs. 70.9 (p<0.00006). Mean CTVpvsSZCT vs. CTVpvsSZMR were 68.6 vs. 64.4 (p=0.14). Interobserver difference for CTVpros defined by CT images was significant (39.2 vs. 34.6; p=0,0058). However, the difference was not significant using MRI images (32.0 vs. 31.9; p=0.93). Interobserver differences for CTVpvs were significant using either CT (85.8 vs. 68.6; p=0.0001) or MRI (70.9 vs. 64.4; p=0.004). Ratio of mean volumes contoured by the two observers were 1,12 (CT) vs. 1 (MRI) for CTVpros and 1,2 (CT) vs. 1,09 (MRI) for CTVpvs. Clinical target volumes defined for prostate cancer external beam radiotherapy by MRI images are significantly smaller compared to CT image based contouring.

Thrombin generation has a central role in hemorrhage control and vascular occlusion and its measurement provides new metrics of these processes providing sufficient evaluation of an individual's hemostatic competence and response to anticoagulant therapy. The objective of the study is to assess a new measure of hypercoagulability that predisposes to venous thromboembolism in the postoperative period after radical prostatectomy. Pre- (day-1) and postoperative (hour 1, day 6, month 1 and 10) blood samples of 24 patients were tested for plasma thrombin generation (peak thrombin), routine hematology and hemostasis. Patients received low molecular weight heparin for thromboprophylaxis. Peak thrombin levels were higher in patients compared to controls at baseline (p<0.001), and elevated further in the early postoperative period (p<0.001). Longer general anesthesia and high body mass index were associated with increased thrombin generation after surgery (p = 0.024 and p = 0.040). D dimer and fibrinogen levels were higher after radical prostatectomy (p = 0.001 and p<0.001). Conventional clotting tests remained within the reference range. Our study contributed to the cognition of the hypercoagulable state in cancer patients undergoing pelvic surgery and revealed the course of thrombin generation after radical prostatectomy. Whilst it is unsurprising that thrombin generation increases after tissue trauma, further evaluation of this condition during the postoperative period would lead urologists to an international and well-supported consensus regarding thromboprophylaxis in order to provide better clinical outcome. Considering the routine evaluation of procoagulant activity and extending prophylactic anticoagulant therapy accordingly may potentially prevent late thrombotic events.""","""['Matyas Benyo', 'Tibor Flasko', 'Zsuzsanna Molnar', 'Adrienne Kerenyi', 'Zoltan Batta', 'Tamas Jozsa', 'Jolan Harsfalvi']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Assessment of the procoagulant potential after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy: a potential role for extended thromboprophylaxis.', 'Lobectomy and postoperative thromboprophylaxis with enoxaparin improve blood hypercoagulability in patients with localized primary lung adenocarcinoma.', 'Thromboelastometry as a supplementary tool for evaluation of hemostasis in severe sepsis and septic shock.', 'Laparoscopic and robotic-assisted versus open radical prostatectomy for the treatment of localised prostate cancer.', 'Prognostic prediction following radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer using conventional as well as molecular biological approaches.', 'Venous thromboprophylaxis in urological cancer surgery.', 'Thrombin Generation and Cancer: Contributors and Consequences.', 'Evaluation of D-dimer and lactate dehydrogenase plasma levels in patients with relapsed acute leukemia.']"""

Using univariate analysis, we found that increase in life decades of the cases almost doubles the risk of having PCa (odds ratio = 1.95; P = .00), and the probability of developing cancer may increase by 74% in ketchup consumers. After multiple variable regressions, it was revealed that the odds of developing PCa increase by 90% only for every decade, and other variables did not have any significant association with PCa.  Conclusion:   In clinical practice, PSA level combined with the age at presentation can be used as predictors of PCa probability and the necessity of biopsy.""","""['Gholam Reza Pourmand', 'Farzad Allameh', 'Kazem Mohammad', 'Sanaz Dehghani', 'Bita Pourmand', 'Abdol Rasoul Mehrsai', 'Seyed Hamed Hosseini']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Urol J""","""['Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) isoform p2PSA significantly improves the prediction of prostate cancer at initial extended prostate biopsies in patients with total PSA between 2.0 and 10 ng/ml: results of a prospective study in a clinical setting.', 'IGF-II serum levels increase discrimination between benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer and improve the predictive value of PSA in clinical staging.', 'The importance of human glandular kallikrein and its correlation with different prostate specific antigen serum forms in the detection of prostate carcinoma.', 'Accurate cut-off point for free to total prostate-specific antigen ratio used to improve differentiation of prostate cancer from benign prostate hyperplasia in Iranian population.', 'Risk of developing prostate cancer in the future: overview of prognostic biomarkers.', 'Can Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System Version 2 reduce unnecessary prostate biopsies in men with PSA levels of 4-10\xa0ng/ml?', 'Cytotoxic Effects of the Ethanol Bane Skin Extract in Human Prostate Cancer Pc3 Cells.']"""

Recent studies revealed MYD88 mutation in hematological malignancies and MYD88 overexpression in some solid cancers. The aim of this study was to see whether alterations of MYD88 protein expression and somatic mutation of MYD88 gene are features of common solid cancers.  Methods:   We analyzed MYD88 mutation in 45 gastric, 45 colorectal, 45 breast, 45 hepatocellular, 45 prostate and 45 lung carcinomas by single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP). We also analyzed MYD88 protein expression in 60 gastric, 60 coloretal and 107 prostate carcinomas by immunohistochemistry.  Results:   In the immunohistochemistry results, MYD88 protein was highly expressed in gastric (75%), colorectal (80%) and prostate (83%) cancers. However, MYD88 expression was significantly different among normal tissues (gastric: 58%, colon: 100%, prostate: 86%). MYD88 expression was significantly increased in gastric cancer cells compared with normal cells, whereas it was decreased in colorectal cancer cells compared with normal cells. There were no somatic mutations of the MYD88 gene in gastric, colorectal, breast, hepatocellular, prostate and lung carcinomas.  Conclusions:   Our data indicate that MYD88 overexpression might be a feature of many solid cancers, but MYD88 expression in normal cells differs depending on the organs. The data suggest that a gain of MYD88 expression in gastric cancers might play a role in cancer pathogenesis by activating oncogenic functions of MYD88.""","""['Eun Mi Je', 'Sung Soo Kim', 'Nam Jin Yoo', 'Sug Hyung Lee']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Tumori""","""['Mutational analysis of oncogenic AKT E17K mutation in common solid cancers and acute leukaemias.', 'Absence of paxillin gene mutation in lung cancer and other common solid cancers.', 'Mutational analysis of caspase-14 gene in common carcinomas.', 'Involvement of the multiple tumor suppressor genes and 12-lipoxygenase in human prostate cancer.

Methods:   Cancer death certifications (for 30 sites) and resident population estimates in 2008 stratified by sex and age were obtained from the World Health Organization (WHO) database (WHOSIS). Mortality rates were age-standardized on the world standard population.  Results:   Cancer deaths registered in Italy in 2008 were 172,783 (97,773 men and 75,010 women), corresponding to age-standardized death rates of 144.1/100,000 men and 84.3/100,000 women. The projected cancer deaths in 2012 are 178,000 (100,000 men, 78,000 women) and the corresponding rates 132,5/100,000 men and 80.5/100,000 women. The favorable trend in lung cancer mortality among men was confirmed, with rates of 37.7/100,000 in 2008 (all ages) and 33.3 for 2012. Other tobacco-related cancers also declined in men but not in women, including pancreatic cancer, whose rates tended to level off over the last 3 years. The fall in female cancer mortality rates continues to be led by favorable trends in breast cancer (16.1/100,000 in 2007 and 15.2 in 2012), intestinal cancer, stomach cancer and uterine cancer. However, the female lung cancer mortality was still rising with 7743 deaths in 2008 (9.5/100,000), and lung cancer is predicted to become the second cause of female cancer mortality by 2012 (8,500 deaths, 9.8/100,000).  Conclusions:   Reduced tobacco and alcohol consumption are largely responsible for the favorable trends in cancer mortality in men. Advances in treatment and management accounted for the reduced mortality from colorectal cancer, breast cancer, leukemias and a few other cancers, as well as improved diagnosis for colorectal, cervical and breast cancer. The rising epidemic of tobacco-related deaths in women indicates the need for targeted tobacco-control strategies.""","""['Tiziana Rosso', 'Matteo Malvezzi', 'Paola Bertuccio', 'Eva Negri', 'Carlo La Vecchia', 'Adriano Decarli']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Tumori""","""['Cancer mortality trend analysis in Italy, 1970-2007.', 'Cancer mortality trend analysis in Italy, 1980-2010, and predictions for 2015.', 'Trends in cancer mortality in Italy, 1955-1978.', 'Cancer, cigarette smoking and premature death in Europe: a review including the Recommendations of European Cancer Experts Consensus Meeting, Helsinki, October 1996.', 'Epidemiology of cancer in the United States.', 'Global disparities in patients with multiple myeloma: a rapid evidence assessment.', 'Diabetes and Insulin Therapy, but Not Metformin, Are Related to Hepatocellular Cancer Risk.', 'A Systematic Review of the Burden of Pancreatic Cancer in Europe: Real-World Impact on Survival, Quality of Life and Costs.', 'Cancer mortality trends between 1988 and 2009 in the metropolitan area of Naples and Caserta, Southern Italy: Results from a joinpoint regression analysis.']"""

The most common IDH1 mutation affects codon 132 and results in the conversion of amino acid residue arginine (R) to histidine (H). This IDH1 mutation is associated with a genetic and clinical characteristic group of gliomas in terms of grade and prognosis. We investigated whether immunohistochemistry (IHC) using a monoclonal antibody against the IDH1 mutant protein could be used in routine surgical pathology for identification of the mutation in solid human tumors. A total of 549 solid human tumors were examined in tissue microarrays, including prostate, thyroid, renal cell, ovarian, endometrial, breast, colorectal, non-small cell lung carcinoma, melanomas, and gliomas. IHC detected the IDH1 mutation in 72% (13/18) anaplastic astrocytomas and 30% (3/10) astrocytomas; however, it failed to detect the mutation in 258 thyroid, 11 renal cell, 10 ovarian, 18 endometrial, 20 breast, 25 colorectal, 22 non-small cell lung carcinoma, 25 melanomas, and 8 thyroid follicular adenomas. In contrast, expression of the IDH1 mutation was noted in 3 of 118 (2.5%) prostate carcinomas.

Thionine was used as redox system for electrochemical probe. The adsorbed thionine displayed a surface-controlled electrode process with electron transfer rate constant of 6.5 s⁻¹ and surface coverage of 3.1×10⁻¹¹ mol cm⁻². The PSA antibody (anti-PSA) was immobilized or entrapped in the nanocomposite and used in a sandwich type complex immunoassay with anti-PSA labeled with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) as secondary antibody and H₂O₂ as the substrate. Under optimal conditions, the DPV peak current of the immunosensor increased linearly with increasing PSA concentration in two concentration ranges, 0.2-1.0 and 1-40 ng ml⁻¹ with detection limit 20 pg ml⁻¹. The intra-assay and inter-assay coefficients of variation (CVs) for five replicate determinations were 2% and 1.35% at 5 ng ml⁻¹ PSA. The immunosensor has been used for PSA detection in serum samples and the accuracy of the method was demonstrated by comparison to the standard ELISA assay. Furthermore, the immunosensor can be used for detection of PSA in prostate tissue samples. The simple one-step fabrication method, high sensitivity, good reproducibility and repeatability as well as acceptable accuracy for PSA detection in human serum samples are the main advantages of this immunosensor.

Compared with a single-threshold (ST) rule, smaller deviations from baseline biomarker levels are required to signal disease. We demonstrated improvement in ovarian cancer early detection by using a longitudinal algorithm to monitor annual CA125 levels.  Patients and methods:   We retrospectively evaluated serial preclinical serum CA125 values measured annually in 44 incident ovarian cancer cases identified from participants in the PLCO (Prostate Lung Colorectal and Ovarian) Cancer Screening Trial to determine how frequently and to what extent the parametric empirical Bayes (PEB) longitudinal screening algorithm identifies ovarian cancer earlier than an ST rule.  Results:   The PEB algorithm detected ovarian cancer earlier than an ST rule in a substantial proportion of cases. At 99% specificity, which corresponded to the ST-rule CA125 cutoff ≥ 35 U/mL that was used in the PLCO trial, 20% of cases were identified earlier by using the PEB algorithm. Among these cases, the PEB signaled abnormal CA125 values, on average, 10 months earlier and at a CA125 concentration 42% lower (20 U/mL) than the ST-rule cutoff. The proportion of cases detected earlier by the PEB algorithm and the earliness of detection increased as the specificity of the screening rule was reduced.  Conclusion:   The PEB longitudinal algorithm identifies ovarian cancer earlier and at lower biomarker concentrations than an ST screening algorithm adjusted to the same specificity. Longitudinal biomarker assessment by using the PEB algorithm may have application for screening other solid tumors in which biomarkers are available.""","""['Charles W Drescher', 'Chirag Shah', 'Jason Thorpe', ""Kathy O'Briant"", 'Garnet L Anderson', 'Christine D Berg', 'Nicole Urban', 'Martin W McIntosh']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Clin Oncol""","""['Comparison of Longitudinal CA125 Algorithms as a First-Line Screen for Ovarian Cancer in the General Population.', 'Complementary Longitudinal Serum Biomarkers to CA125 for Early Detection of Ovarian Cancer.', 'Highly accurate detection of ovarian cancer using CA125 but limited improvement with serum matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry profiling.', 'Screening for ovarian cancer in the general population.', 'Ovarian cancer screening: Current status and future directions.', 'Smart Diagnostics: Combining Artificial Intelligence and In Vitro Diagnostics.', 'Detecting Early Hepatocellular Carcinoma in Patients With Chronic Hepatitis B Using Longitudinal α-Fetoprotein Screening.', 'The Increasing Prognostic and Predictive Roles of the Tumor Primary Chemosensitivity Assessed by CA-125 Elimination Rate Constant K (KELIM) in Ovarian Cancer: A Narrative Review.', 'LIM domain-containing 2 (LIMD2) promotes the progress of ovarian cancer via the focal adhesion signaling pathway.', 'Development and Validation of Prognostic Model in Transitional Bladder Cancer Based on Inflammatory Response-Associated Genes.']"""

In this study, we investigated the role of SIRT1 in multiple human prostate cancer cell lines and prostate-specific PTEN knockout mouse model using resveratrol. Androgen-independent prostate cancer cell lines (C42B, PC3, and DU145) express higher levels of SIRT1 than androgen-responsive (LNCaP) and nontumorigenic prostate cells (RWPE-1). Resveratrol enhanced this expression without any significant effect on SIRT1 enzymatic activity. Inhibition of SIRT1 expression using shRNA enhanced cell proliferation and inhibited autophagy by repressing phosphorylation of S6K and 4E-BP1. These biologic correlates were reversed in the presence of resveratrol. Analysis of prostates from dietary intervention with resveratrol showed a significant reduction in prostate weight and reduction in the incidence of high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplastic (HGPIN) lesions by approximately 54% with no significant change in body weight. Consistent with the in vitro findings, resveratrol intervention in the PTEN knockout mouse model was associated with reduction in the prostatic levels of mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) activity and increased expression of SIRT1. These data suggest that SIRT1/S6K-mediated inhibition of autophagy drives prostate tumorigenesis. Therefore, modulation of SIRT1/S6K signaling represents an effective strategy for prostate cancer prevention.""","""['Guiming Li', 'Paul Rivas', 'Roble Bedolla', 'Dinesh Thapa', 'Robert L Reddick', 'Rita Ghosh', 'Addanki P Kumar']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Cancer Prev Res (Phila)""","""['SIRT1 inhibition-induced senescence as a strategy to prevent prostate cancer progression.', 'Disruption of a Sirt1-dependent autophagy checkpoint in the prostate results in prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia lesion formation.', 'Resveratrol modulates tumor cell proliferation and protein translation via SIRT1-dependent AMPK activation.', 'The controversial links among calorie restriction, SIRT1, and resveratrol.', 'Sirtuins, resveratrol and the intertwining cellular pathways connecting them.', 'Admixture mapping implicates 13q33.3 as ancestry-of-origin locus for Alzheimer disease in Hispanic and Latino populations.', 'SIRT1 mediated gastric cancer progression under glucose deprivation through the FoxO1-Rab7-autophagy axis.', 'The Mechanistic Roles of Sirtuins in Breast and Prostate Cancer.', 'Resveratrol inhibits TRAF6/PTCH/SMO signal and regulates prostate cancer progression.', 'SIRT1 inhibition-induced senescence as a strategy to prevent prostate cancer progression.']"""

ESS measurements were performed on 42 prostate glands ex vivo and correlated with standard histopathological assessment. Sliced glands were examined with wavelength ranges of 330-760 nm. The ESS portable system used a new fiber-optic probe with integrated cutting tool, designed specifically for ex vivo pathology applications. ESS spectra were grouped by diagnosis from standard histopathological procedure and then classified using linear support vector machine. Preliminary data are encouraging. ESS data showed strong spectral trends correlating with the histopathological assignments. The classification results showed a sensitivity of 0.83 and specificity of 0.87 for distinguishing dysplastic prostatic tissue from benign prostatic tissue. Similar results were obtained for distinguishing dysplastic prostatic tissue from prostatitis with a sensitivity and specificity of 0.80 and 0.88, respectively.

The aim of this study was to demonstrate that an integrated lysis and measurement system could be used to quantitatively measure intracellular target molecules using prostate specific antigen as a model analyte. The system described utilises the inherent physical properties of paramagnetic particles for both cell lysis and antigen quantification in the same vessel. This is achieved using ultrasound to energise paramagnetic particles to lyse cells combined with a magnetic immunoassay to measure intracellular protein, synthesised within the cells. Antibody coated paramagnetic particles were energised using pulses of ultrasound energy to penetrate and lyse cells and capture intracellular protein on the particle surface. The particles were drawn to an antibody coated sensor surface, in an applied magnetic field, which bound to captured analyte on the paramagnetic particle. The number of immobilised particles on the sensor surface is quantified by a resonant coil magnetometer. The total assay time was reduced to less than 15min. To demonstrate the utility of the system a model assay for intracellular prostate specific antigen was developed to show that the assay could detect differences in the amount of intracellular protein. This was achieved by exposing LNCaP cells to increasing concentrations of testosterone, which causes an increase in prostate specific antigen production. The rapid intracellular assay was able to demonstrate increasing amounts of intracellular prostate specific antigen resulting from increasing testosterone exposure. The technology could be used to develop rapid diagnostic tests for intracellular biomarkers that are difficult to detect in normal serum samples, for example viral proteins and intracellular cancer proteins.""","""['Elham Sharif', 'Janice Kiely', 'Richard Luxton']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Immunol Methods""","""['The dual role of paramagnetic particles for integrated lysis and measurement in a rapid immunoassay for intracellular proteins.', 'Streamlining immunoassays with immiscible filtrations assisted by surface tension.', 'Sensitive immunoassay of tissue cell proteins procured by laser capture microdissection.', 'Improving the comparability of immunoassays for prostate-specific antigen (PSA): progress and problems.', 'Affinity assays for detection of cellular communication and biomarkers.', 'Bioconjugation and stabilisation of biomolecules in biosensors.', 'An inexpensive, fast and sensitive quantitative lateral flow magneto-immunoassay for total prostate specific antigen.']"""

Therefore, combinatorial approaches with TRAIL and different chemotherapeutic agents have been developed to overcome the resistance of cancer cells to TRAIL. Here, we investigated the sensitizing effects of ursolic acid (UA), a pentacyclic triterpenoid found in many plants, on TRAIL-induced prostate cancer cell apoptosis.

In vitro studies showed up to 50-fold increase of the reporter genome by DTSTA. Compared with TSTA reporter alone, DTSTA application exhibited a 25-fold increase in imaging signal in PCa xenografts. DTSTA approach is also beneficial for a combination of two TSTA Ads with distinct promoters, although amplification is observed only when TSTA-CRAd can replicate.

We investigated the mechanism of PGE2-induced SDF-1 regulation in human prostate stromal cell and analyzed the effects in a stromal-epithelial interaction model. PGE2 stimulation increased SDF-1 expression in the prostate stromal cell lines WPMY-1 and NAF. We revealed signaling through the PGE2 receptor EP3 and activation of protein kinase A (PKA) are required. The EP3 agonist sulprostone and the cAMP analog forskolin mimicked and the EP3 siRNA, antagonist L798106 and the PKA inhibitor H89 abrogated the effect of PGE2 on SDF-1 expression. SDF-1 promoter truncation experiments demonstrated a 254 bp (from nt -219 to nt +34) SDF-1 proximal promoter fragment containing 5 putative transcription factor Sp1 binding motifs is sufficient for PGE2 induction. CHIP assays confirmed binding and PGE2 induced recruitment of Sp1 to the SDF-1 promoter. Sp1 motif mutation identified Sp1 motifs -140/-133 and -9/+1 as the crucial elements responsible for PGE2 induction. Moreover, SDF-1 was up- or down-regulated by Sp1 over-expression or knock-down. We also demonstrate stimulation of migration of prostate cancer cell lines PC3 and DU145 with conditioned media collected from WPMY-1 or NAF cells stimulated with PGE2 and blockade of enhanced migration by a SDF-1 neutralizing antibody.

For each patient with a positive margin or extraprostatic extension we determined whether these pathological characteristics would have been diagnosed had the specimen been examined by 3 partial sampling techniques. The Harrell concordance index was used to quantify the predictive performance of the Cox models based on the potential findings of the different sampling methods.  Results:   Partial sampling methods 1 and 2, which included the examination of alternate slides, missed 13% to 21% of positive margins and 27% to 46% of extraprostatic extensions. The effect on biochemical recurrence-free survival of these undetected pathological features was similar to that of positive margins and extraprostatic extension that would have been diagnosed by corresponding techniques. Method 3, which sampled the entire posterior region, the mid anterior prostate and the rest of the ipsilateral anterior gland (if sizeable tumor was seen), detected 95% of positive margins and 94% of extraprostatic extensions. The extraprostatic extension missed by this method was not associated with a significant increase in the risk of biochemical recurrence. The Harrell concordance index of the multivariate models was 0.806, 0.797, 0.795 and 0.804 based on the results of complete sampling, and methods 1, 2 and 3, respectively.

By correcting for the effects of these variants on prostate specific antigen, it may be possible to create a personalized prostate specific antigen cutoff to more accurately identify individuals for whom biopsy is recommended. Therefore, we determined how many men would continue to meet common biopsy criteria after genetic correction of their measured prostate specific antigen concentrations.  Materials and methods:   The genotypes of 4 single nucleotide polymorphisms previously associated with serum prostate specific antigen levels (rs2736098, rs10788160, rs11067228 and rs17632542) were determined in 964 healthy Caucasian volunteers without prostate cancer. Genetic correction of prostate specific antigen was performed by dividing an individual's prostate specific antigen value by his combined genetic risk. Analyses were used to compare the percentage of men who would meet commonly used biopsy thresholds (2.5 ng/ml or greater, or 4.0 ng/ml or greater) before and after genetic correction.  Results:   Genetic correction of serum prostate specific antigen results was associated with a significantly decreased percentage of men meeting biopsy thresholds. Genetic correction could lead to a 15% or 20% relative reduction in the total number of biopsies using a biopsy threshold of 2.5 ng/ml or greater, or 4.0 ng/ml or greater, respectively. In addition, genetic correction could result in an 18% to 22% reduction in the number of potentially unnecessary biopsies and a 3% decrease in potentially delayed diagnoses.

Transfection with either YY1 or BclXL siRNA resulted in the inhibition of both YY1 and BclXL expressions and sensitized the cells to CDDP apoptosis. Mice bearing PC-3 tumor xenografts and treated with the combination of DETANONOate and CDDP resulted in significant inhibition of tumor growth; treatment with single agent alone did not have any effect on tumor growth. Analysis of patients TMA tissues with prostatic cancer revealed higher expression of both YY1 and BclXL as a function of tumor grades and their levels were directly correlated. Thus, both YY1 and BclXL are potential prognostic biomarkers. Overall, the above findings suggest that one mechanism of DETANONOate-induced sensitization of resistant tumor cells to CDDP correlated with the inhibition of NF-κB and its targets YY1 and BclXL. The examination of the combination of NO donors and cytotoxic therapy in the treatment of resistant prostate cancer may be warranted.""","""['Sara Huerta-Yepez', 'Stavroula Baritaki', 'Guillermina Baay-Guzman', 'Marco A Hernandez-Luna', 'Angeles Hernandez-Cueto', 'Mario I Vega', 'Benjamin Bonavida']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Nitric Oxide""","""['Nitric oxide sensitizes tumor cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis via inhibition of the DR5 transcription repressor Yin Yang 1.', 'Dual role of NO donors in the reversal of tumor cell resistance and EMT: Downregulation of the NF-κB/Snail/YY1/RKIP circuitry.', 'In vitro and in vivo sensitization of SW620 metastatic colon cancer cells to CDDP-induced apoptosis by the nitric oxide donor DETANONOate: Involvement of AIF.', 'Galiximab signals B-NHL cells and inhibits the activities of NF-κB-induced YY1- and snail-resistant factors: mechanism of sensitization to apoptosis by chemoimmunotherapeutic drugs.', 'Nitric oxide-mediated sensitization of resistant tumor cells to apoptosis by chemo-immunotherapeutics.', 'Targeting Transcription Factor YY1 for Cancer Treatment: Current Strategies and Future Directions.', 'Roles and Regulation of BCL-xL in Hematological Malignancies.', 'RKIP Pleiotropic Activities in Cancer and Inflammatory Diseases: Role in Immunity.', 'Effect of the transcription factor YY1 on the development of pancreatic endocrine and exocrine tumors: a narrative review.', 'The biological implications of Yin Yang 1 in the hallmarks of cancer.']"""

Relatively little is known about the prevalence and evolution of cancer among stroke patients over the last decade.  Methods:   We used the Nationwide Inpatient Sample to identify discharges with any InternationalClassification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, diagnosis code for cancer and ischemic stroke from 1997 to 2006. We then calculated age-adjusted yearly acute ischemic stroke hospitalization rates among adult populations with and without cancer.  Results:   Prevalence of cancer among hospitalized stroke patients increased from 1997 to 2006 (N = 31,075 [9.1% of all ischemic stroke hospitalizations] to 34,138 [10.6%], P < .0001). The most common types of cancer among hospitalized stroke patients in 1997 and 2006 were prostate (21% versus 19%), breast (19% versus 19%), gastrointestinal (16% versus 13%), and colorectal (13% versus 13%). Over the decade there was a significant decrease in the prevalence of stroke hospitalizations (slope -3.02, 95% confidence interval -3.69 to -2.34), but not among cancer patients (slope 1.35, 95% confidence interval -0.88 to 3.58).  Conclusion:   About 1 in 10 hospitalized ischemic stroke patients in the United States has comorbid cancer, and there has been a slight rise in this rate over the last decade.

However, the mechanism underpinning epigenetic-based gene activation in carcinogenesis is still poorly understood. Here, we identify a mechanism of domain gene deregulation through coordinated long-range epigenetic activation (LREA) of regions that typically span 1 Mb and harbor key oncogenes, microRNAs, and cancer biomarker genes. Gene promoters within LREA domains are characterized by a gain of active chromatin marks and a loss of repressive marks. Notably, although promoter hypomethylation is uncommon, we show that extensive DNA hypermethylation of CpG islands or ""CpG-island borders"" is strongly related to cancer-specific gene activation or differential promoter usage.

Objective:   To compare the operative, functional, and oncologic outcomes between pure laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (LRP) and RALP.  Design, setting, and participants:   From 2001 to 2011, 2386 extraperitoneal LRPs were performed consecutively in cases of localised prostate cancers.  Intervention:   A total of 1377 LRPs and 1009 RALPs were performed using an extraperitoneal approach.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Patient demographics, surgical parameters, pathologic features, and functional outcomes were collected into a prospective database and compared between LRP and RALP. Biochemical recurrence-free survival was tested using the Kaplan-Meier method. Mean follow-up was 39 and 15.4 mo in the LRP and RALP groups, respectively.  Results and limitations:   Shorter durations of operative time and of hospital stay were reported in the RALP group compared with the LRP group (p<0.001) even beyond the 100 first cases. Mean blood loss was significantly lower in the RALP group (p<0.001). The overall rate and the severity of the complications did not differ between the two groups. In pT2 disease, lower rates of positive margins were reported in the RALP group (p=0.030; odds ratio [OR]: 0.396) in multivariable analyses. The surgical approach did not affect the continence recovery. Robot assistance was independently predictive for potency recovery (p=0.045; OR: 5.9). Survival analyses showed an equal oncologic control between the two groups. Limitations were the lack of randomisation and the short-term follow-up.  Conclusions:   Robotic assistance using an extraperitoneal approach offers better results than pure laparoscopy in terms of operative time, blood loss, and hospital stay. The robotic approach independently improves the potency recovery but not the continence recovery. When strict indications of nerve-sparing techniques are respected, RALP gives better results than LRP in terms of surgical margins in pathologically organ-confined disease. Longer follow-up is justified to reach conclusions on oncologic outcomes.""","""['Guillaume Ploussard', 'Alexandre de la Taille', 'Morgan Moulin', 'Dimitri Vordos', 'Andras Hoznek', 'Claude-Clément Abbou', 'Laurent Salomon']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Minimally invasive radical prostatectomy: transition from pure laparoscopic to robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Preliminary results of robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RALP) after fellowship training and experience in laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (LRP).', 'Comparison of outcomes between pure laparoscopic vs robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy: a study of comparative effectiveness based upon validated quality of life outcomes.', 'Positive surgical margin and perioperative complication rates of primary surgical treatments for prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis comparing retropubic, laparoscopic, and robotic prostatectomy.', 'Retropubic, laparoscopic, and robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: a systematic review and cumulative analysis of comparative studies.', 'Robotic-assisted versus laparoscopic radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer: the first separate systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials and non-randomised studies.', 'Comparison of Perioperative, Functional, and Oncological Outcomes of Transperitoneal and Extraperitoneal Laparoscopic Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Laparoscopic simple prostatectomy versus robot-assisted simple prostatectomy for large benign prostatic hyperplasia: a systematic review and meta-analysis of comparative trials.', 'Robotic surgery in comparison to the open and laparoscopic approaches in the field of urology: a systematic review.', 'Influence of operative time and blood loss on surgical margins and functional outcomes for laparoscopic versus robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy: a prospective analysis.']"""

In the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2010 (GBD 2010), we aimed to estimate annual deaths for the world and 21 regions between 1980 and 2010 for 235 causes, with uncertainty intervals (UIs), separately by age and sex.  Methods:   We attempted to identify all available data on causes of death for 187 countries from 1980 to 2010 from vital registration, verbal autopsy, mortality surveillance, censuses, surveys, hospitals, police records, and mortuaries. We assessed data quality for completeness, diagnostic accuracy, missing data, stochastic variations, and probable causes of death. We applied six different modelling strategies to estimate cause-specific mortality trends depending on the strength of the data. For 133 causes and three special aggregates we used the Cause of Death Ensemble model (CODEm) approach, which uses four families of statistical models testing a large set of different models using different permutations of covariates. Model ensembles were developed from these component models. We assessed model performance with rigorous out-of-sample testing of prediction error and the validity of 95% UIs. For 13 causes with low observed numbers of deaths, we developed negative binomial models with plausible covariates. For 27 causes for which death is rare, we modelled the higher level cause in the cause hierarchy of the GBD 2010 and then allocated deaths across component causes proportionately, estimated from all available data in the database. For selected causes (African trypanosomiasis, congenital syphilis, whooping cough, measles, typhoid and parathyroid, leishmaniasis, acute hepatitis E, and HIV/AIDS), we used natural history models based on information on incidence, prevalence, and case-fatality. We separately estimated cause fractions by aetiology for diarrhoea, lower respiratory infections, and meningitis, as well as disaggregations by subcause for chronic kidney disease, maternal disorders, cirrhosis, and liver cancer. For deaths due to collective violence and natural disasters, we used mortality shock regressions. For every cause, we estimated 95% UIs that captured both parameter estimation uncertainty and uncertainty due to model specification where CODEm was used. We constrained cause-specific fractions within every age-sex group to sum to total mortality based on draws from the uncertainty distributions.  Findings:   In 2010, there were 52·8 million deaths globally. At the most aggregate level, communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional causes were 24·9% of deaths worldwide in 2010, down from 15·9 million (34·1%) of 46·5 million in 1990. This decrease was largely due to decreases in mortality from diarrhoeal disease (from 2·5 to 1·4 million), lower respiratory infections (from 3·4 to 2·8 million), neonatal disorders (from 3·1 to 2·2 million), measles (from 0·63 to 0·13 million), and tetanus (from 0·27 to 0·06 million). Deaths from HIV/AIDS increased from 0·30 million in 1990 to 1·5 million in 2010, reaching a peak of 1·7 million in 2006. Malaria mortality also rose by an estimated 19·9% since 1990 to 1·17 million deaths in 2010. Tuberculosis killed 1·2 million people in 2010. Deaths from non-communicable diseases rose by just under 8 million between 1990 and 2010, accounting for two of every three deaths (34·5 million) worldwide by 2010. 8 million people died from cancer in 2010, 38% more than two decades ago; of these, 1·5 million (19%) were from trachea, bronchus, and lung cancer. Ischaemic heart disease and stroke collectively killed 12·9 million people in 2010, or one in four deaths worldwide, compared with one in five in 1990; 1·3 million deaths were due to diabetes, twice as many as in 1990. The fraction of global deaths due to injuries (5·1 million deaths) was marginally higher in 2010 (9·6%) compared with two decades earlier (8·8%). This was driven by a 46% rise in deaths worldwide due to road traffic accidents (1·3 million in 2010) and a rise in deaths from falls. Ischaemic heart disease, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), lower respiratory infections, lung cancer, and HIV/AIDS were the leading causes of death in 2010. Ischaemic heart disease, lower respiratory infections, stroke, diarrhoeal disease, malaria, and HIV/AIDS were the leading causes of years of life lost due to premature mortality (YLLs) in 2010, similar to what was estimated for 1990, except for HIV/AIDS and preterm birth complications. YLLs from lower respiratory infections and diarrhoea decreased by 45-54% since 1990; ischaemic heart disease and stroke YLLs increased by 17-28%. Regional variations in leading causes of death were substantial. Communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional causes still accounted for 76% of premature mortality in sub-Saharan Africa in 2010. Age standardised death rates from some key disorders rose (HIV/AIDS, Alzheimer's disease, diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease in particular), but for most diseases, death rates fell in the past two decades; including major vascular diseases, COPD, most forms of cancer, liver cirrhosis, and maternal disorders. For other conditions, notably malaria, prostate cancer, and injuries, little change was noted.  Interpretation:   Population growth, increased average age of the world's population, and largely decreasing age-specific, sex-specific, and cause-specific death rates combine to drive a broad shift from communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional causes towards non-communicable diseases. Nevertheless, communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional causes remain the dominant causes of YLLs in sub-Saharan Africa. Overlaid on this general pattern of the epidemiological transition, marked regional variation exists in many causes, such as interpersonal violence, suicide, liver cancer, diabetes, cirrhosis, Chagas disease, African trypanosomiasis, melanoma, and others. Regional heterogeneity highlights the importance of sound epidemiological assessments of the causes of death on a regular basis.

The aim of this study was to test this hypothesis by measuring the average patient in-room time with VMAT versus dynamic multileaf collimator (DMLC) IMRT.  Methods:   Custom institutional software (RTMetrix) was used to mine the treatment times from the record-and-verify database. The in-room time (the time between patient entry and exit) was computed for each patient using RTMetrix. Average room time was compared between VMAT patients (n = 44) and IMRT patients (n = 99). Subgroup comparisons (1-arc or 2-arc VMAT, 5-field or 7-field IMRT, and electromagnetic transponder [Calypso] or gold-marker tracking) were performed. For all comparisons, 2-tailed, 2-sample, equal variance Student's t-tests were used.  Results:   Average room time was significantly shorter for all VMAT versus DMLC IMRT (P = .0014) procedures, along with VMAT versus 7-field DMLC IMRT (P < .001), but not VMAT versus 5-field DMLC IMRT (P = .81). Room time was longer for Calypso versus gold seed patients (P < .001), but VMAT reduced treatment time in Calypso patients (P = .01). This resulted in Calypso VMAT patients' having similar treatment times to non-Calypso DMLC IMRT patients (P = .220).  Conclusions:   These data show that VMAT can shorten room times and improve patient throughput over 7-field DMLC IMRT. Additionally, the data demonstrate that treatment with VMAT permits the use of advanced prostate tracking (Calypso), resulting in similar room times as with standard 7-field DMLC IMRT with conventional tracking.""","""['William A Hall', 'Timothy H Fox', 'Xiaojun Jiang', 'Roshan S Prabhu', 'Peter J Rossi', 'Karen Godette', 'Ashesh B Jani']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Am Coll Radiol""","""['Accuracy of real-time couch tracking during 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy, intensity modulated radiation therapy, and volumetric modulated arc therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Optimising the dosimetric quality and efficiency of post-prostatectomy radiotherapy: a planning study comparing the performance of volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT) with an optimised seven-field intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) technique.', 'Volumetric modulated arc therapy: planning and evaluation for prostate cancer cases.', 'Integration of real-time internal electromagnetic position monitoring coupled with dynamic multileaf collimator tracking: an intensity-modulated radiation therapy feasibility study.', 'A review of stereotactic body radiotherapy - is volumetric modulated arc therapy the answer?', 'Use of a Biodegradable, Contrast-Filled Rectal Spacer Balloon in Intensity-Modulated Radiotherapy for Intermediate-Risk Prostate Cancer Patients: Dosimetric Gains in the BioPro-RCMI-1505 Study.', 'Whole brain radiotherapy using four-field box technique with tilting baseplate for parotid gland sparing.', 'Evaluating the potential benefit of reduced planning target volume margins for low and intermediate risk patients with prostate cancer using real-time electromagnetic tracking.', 'Volumetric-modulated arc therapy versus intensity-modulated radiotherapy for large volume retroperitoneal sarcomas: A comparative analysis of dosimetric and treatment delivery parameters.', 'Dosimetric comparison of intensity-modulated radiotherapy and volumetric-modulated arc radiotherapy in patients with prostate cancer: a meta-analysis.']"""

Monitoring the movement of the prostate during treatment is a promising but in most centres not feasible solution. However, the projection images of the pre-treatment cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) provide information about the motion of the target immediately preceding the treatment. This motion information can be extracted from any standard CBCT scan which is available in many institutions. In this study we measure the motion of the prostate during the pre-treatment CBCT and investigate whether this motion is correlated with the intra-fractional movement of the prostate.  Material and methods:   Pre- and post-treatment CBCT scans were made during a number of the fractions (average 11 range 8-12) for 13 prostate cancer patients during the radiation treatment course. The displacement of the post-treatment CBCT scans relative to the pre-treatment position was used to assess the intra-fractional motion. Automated image analysis was used to track the 2D position of radiopaque markers in the projection images of the scans. The most probable 3D trajectory of the markers during the CBCT scan was estimated based on a probability density function which was established for each individual scan.  Results:   The accuracy of the tracking algorithm was found satisfactory and the motion of the markers during the CBCT scans was successfully extracted from the projection images. This motion was generally small and uncorrelated with the subsequent intra-fractional movement of the prostate. The correlation coefficients were 20.05, 0.07, and 20.05 in the LR, AP, and CC direction, respectively.  Conclusion:   It is tempting to exploit the pre-treatment CBCT to predict the intra-fractional movement of the prostate but, unfortunately, we have found no correlation between the intra-fractional movement and the motion of the prostate immediately prior to treatment.""","""['Uffe Bernchou', 'Søren N Agergaard', 'Carsten Brink']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Acta Oncol""","""['Assessment of residual error for online cone-beam CT-guided treatment of prostate cancer patients.', 'Automatic prostate localization on cone-beam CT scans for high precision image-guided radiotherapy.', 'Investigation of respiration induced intra- and inter-fractional tumour motion using a standard Cone Beam CT.', 'Intra-fractional uncertainties in image-guided intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) of prostate cancer.', 'Patient movement and motion artefacts in cone beam computed tomography of the dentomaxillofacial region: a systematic literature review.', 'Plan quality for high-risk prostate cancer treated with high field magnetic resonance imaging guided radiotherapy.', 'Target margins in radiotherapy of prostate cancer.', 'Automatic planning of head and neck treatment plans.']"""

This series investigates genitourinary and gastrointestinal toxicity in men with large prostates (> 60 cm(3)) undergoing definitive proton therapy (PT) for prostate cancer. Material and methods. From 2006 to 2010, 186 men with prostates ≥ 60 cm(3) were treated with definitive PT (median dose, 78 CGE) for low- (47%), intermediate- (37%) and high-risk (16%) prostate cancer. Median prostate size was 76 cm(3) (range, 60-143 cm(3)) and pretreatment IPSS was > 15 in 27%. At baseline, 51% were managed for obstructive symptoms with transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) (9.7%) or medical management with α blockers (32%), 5 α-reductase inhibitors (15%), and/or saw palmetto (11%). Fourteen men received ADT for cytoreduction. Results. Median follow-up was two years. Grade 3 genitourinary toxicities occurred in 14 men, including temporary catheterization (n = 7), TURP (n = 6), and balloon dilation for urethral stricture (n = 1). Multivariate analysis demonstrated pretreatment medical management (p = 0.0065) and pretreatment TURP (p = 0.0002) were significantly associated with grade 3 genitourinary toxicity. One man experienced grade 3 gastrointestinal toxicity and 15 men had grade 2 gastrointestinal toxicities.

The knowledge on the interrelation between unmet needs and health-related quality of life is scarce. This paper studies the hypothesis that patient-perceived unmet needs of rehabilitation during the cancer trajectory are associated with decreased quality of life.  Material and methods:   Based on registers, a Danish population-based cohort of adult, incident, mixed-site cancer patients diagnosed between 1 October 2007 and 30 September 2008 was established. At 14 months following diagnosis participants completed a questionnaire including health-related quality of life (EORTC QLQ C-30), psychological distress (POMS-SF), and unmet needs with regard to physical, emotional, family-oriented, sexual, work-related, and financial problems. Unmet needs were assessed through six ad hoc questions.  Results:   Questionnaires were received from 3439 of 4947 patients, resulting in a response rate of 70%. The three most frequent cancer types were breast (28.4%), prostate (14.6%) and colorectal cancer (15.2%). Overall, 60.1% expressed an unmet need of rehabilitation in at least one area, physical and emotional problems being the most frequent (40.0% and 37.5%). For all scales of the EORTC QLQ C-30 and POMS, significant adjusted mean differences were observed between patients with unmet needs in at least one area and patients with no unmet needs (p-values < 0.001). These differences were well above levels usually considered clinically relevant. Further, impairment increased with increasing number of areas in which unmet needs were reported.  Discussion:   We confirmed the hypothesis that patient-perceived unmet needs of rehabilitation during the cancer trajectory are associated with decreased quality of life. This study supports the use of unmet needs questions to identify patients in need of clinical attention. Interventions reducing cancer patients' perceived needs of rehabilitation may enhance quality of life.""","""['Dorte Gilså Hansen', 'Pia Veldt Larsen', 'Lise Vilstrup Holm', 'Nina Rottmann', 'Stinne Holm Bergholdt', 'Jens Søndergaard']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Acta Oncol""","""['Unmet needs in cancer rehabilitation during the early cancer trajectory--a nationwide patient survey.', 'Health-related quality of life in early breast cancer.', 'Social inequality in cancer rehabilitation: a population-based cohort study.', ""A comparison of American and Egyptian cancer patients' attitudes and unmet needs."", 'Health-related quality of life in Asian patients with breast cancer: a systematic review.', 'The mediation role of self-esteem and hope on the relationship of quality of life and unmet needs of elderly with psychiatric disorders.', 'Supportive care needs of patients with colorectal cancer undergoing anticancer therapy: A latent class analysis.', 'Implementation of electronic prospective surveillance models in cancer care: a scoping review.', 'Development and Validation of a Dual-Language (English and Malay) Needs Assessment Tool for Breast Cancer (NeAT-BC).', 'Associations among navigational support and health care utilization and costs in patients with advanced cancer: An analysis based on administrative health insurance data.']"""

We therefore compared patterns of PRT use, cost, and early toxicity among Medicare beneficiaries with prostate cancer with those of intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT).  Methods:   We performed a retrospective study of all Medicare beneficiaries aged greater than or equal to 66 years who received PRT or IMRT for prostate cancer during 2008 and/or 2009. We used multivariable logistic regression to identify factors associated with receipt of PRT. To assess toxicity, each PRT patient was matched with two IMRT patients with similar clinical and sociodemographic characteristics. The main outcome measures were receipt of PRT or IMRT, Medicare reimbursement for each treatment, and early genitourinary, gastrointestinal, and other toxicity. All statistical tests were two-sided.  Results:   We identified 27,647 men; 553 (2%) received PRT and 27,094 (98%) received IMRT. Patients receiving PRT were younger, healthier, and from more affluent areas than patients receiving IMRT. Median Medicare reimbursement was $32,428 for PRT and $18,575 for IMRT. Although PRT was associated with a statistically significant reduction in genitourinary toxicity at 6 months compared with IMRT (5.9% vs 9.5%; odds ratio [OR] = 0.60, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.38 to 0.96, P = .03), at 12 months post-treatment there was no difference in genitourinary toxicity (18.8% vs 17.5%; OR = 1.08, 95% CI = 0.76 to 1.54, P = .66). There was no statistically significant difference in gastrointestinal or other toxicity at 6 months or 12 months post-treatment.

Aneuploidy can be caused by cell division errors due to extra centrosomes and mitotic spindle poles. However, a link between FGF-2 overexpression and chromosome missegregation has so far been elusive. Here, we show that FGF-2 rapidly uncouples centrosome duplication from the cell division cycle in prostate cancer cells through CEP57, an intracellular FGF-2-binding and trafficking factor. CEP57 was initially identified as a regulator of centriole overduplication in an RNA interference screen. We subsequently found that CEP57 rapidly stimulates centriole overduplication and mitotic defects when overexpressed and is required not only for FGF-2-induced centriole overduplication but also for normal centriole duplication. We provide evidence that CEP57 functions by modulating tubulin acetylation, thereby promoting daughter centriole stability. CEP57 was found to be overexpressed on the mRNA and protein level in a subset of prostate cancers, of which the vast majority also showed FGF-2 upregulation.

Recent data suggest that the colonization of the skeleton is mediated in part by collagen type I, the most abundant protein within the bone. We have shown that enhanced collagen I binding through increased expression of integrin α2β1 stimulated in vitro invasion and promoted the growth of PCa cells within the bone. Accordingly, we sought to determine whether α2β1 integrin is a potential mediator of skeletal metastasis. To examine whether α2β1 integrin mediates PCa metastasis, α2 integrin was over-expressed in low-tumorigenic LNCaP PCa cells or selectively knocked-down in highly metastatic LNCaPcol PCa cells. We document that the over-expression of α2 cDNA stimulated whereas α2 shRNA inhibited the ability of transduced cells to bind to or migrate towards collagen in vitro. Correspondingly, α2 integrin knock-down reduced the tumor burden of intra-osseous tumors compared to control-transduced cells. To investigate the clinical significance of α2β1 expression in PCa, α2β1 protein was measured in prostatic tissues and in soft tissue and bone metastases. The data demonstrate that α2β1 protein was elevated in PCa skeletal metastases compared to either PCa primary lesions or soft tissue metastases suggesting that α2β1 contributes to the selective metastasis to the bone. Taken together, these data support that α2β1 integrin is needed for the efficient metastasis of PCa cells to the skeleton.""","""['Joseph L Sottnik', 'Stephanie Daignault-Newton', 'Xiaotun Zhang', 'Colm Morrissey', 'Maha H Hussain', 'Evan T Keller', 'Christopher L Hall']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Clin Exp Metastasis""","""['Type I collagen receptor (alpha2beta1) signaling promotes prostate cancer invasion through RhoC GTPase.', 'Induction of integrin α2 in a highly bone metastatic human prostate cancer cell line: roles of RANKL and AR under three-dimensional suspension culture.', 'Carbohydrate-to-carbohydrate interactions between α2,3-linked sialic acids on α2 integrin subunits and asialo-GM1 underlie the bone metastatic behaviour of LNCAP-derivative C4-2B prostate cancer cells.', 'RGD cadherins and α2β1 integrin in cancer metastasis: A dangerous liaison.', 'α2β1 Integrin.', 'Prostate cancer bone metastases biology and clinical management (Review).', 'Bone Metastases and Health in Prostate Cancer: From Pathophysiology to Clinical Implications.', 'The effects of inhibition and siRNA knockdown of collagen-binding integrins on human umbilical vein endothelial cell migration and tube formation.', 'Non-coding RNA regulation of integrins and their potential as therapeutic targets in cancer.', 'Prostate cancer cells of increasing metastatic potential exhibit diverse contractile forces, cell stiffness, and motility in a microenvironment stiffness-dependent manner.']"""

Patients and methods:   Three hundred thirty-one patients referred to us from January 2009 to April 2011 to perform 18FCH PET/CT were evaluated: 233 of them (mean age 69.7 years) met the inclusion criteria of the study: (1) biochemical relapse after radical prostatectomy (trigger PSA>0.2 ng/mL) (n=224) and (2) high risk for relapse (elevated Gleason score≥8) in spite PSA<0.1 ng/mL during FU (n=9).

The aim of the present study was to examine the PCA3 expression in blood as a diagnostic tool, and to provide an additional strategy to improve PCa diagnosis.  Methods:   PCA3 transcripts were detected by RT-PCR in PBL and prostatic tissues from patients. PBL sampling also included a group of young healthy volunteers. The relationship between the PCA3 RNA detection and clinical characteristics was analyzed.  Results:   PCA3 detection in blood presented 94% specificity and 32% sensitivity, and its combined detection in tissues significantly improved diagnostic parameters. However, PCA3 RNA detection in blood was also associated with PSA levels ≥10 ng/mL, and their combination provided a sensitivity of 60% and specificity of 93%.  Conclusions:   Detection of the PCA3 RNA in patients' blood is an efficient tool for PCa diagnosis because it allows a routine collection procedure, which is also supported by the ongoing screening marker, prostate-specific antigen (PSA).

Therefore, the PI3K-Akt pathway plays a central role in various cellular processes promoting survival signaling that can contribute to the malignant phenotype, and, consequently, is an attractive pharmacologic target. However, as single agents, the efficacy of AKT inhibitors may be limited by resistance mechanisms that result in minimal cell death in tumor cells.  Experimental design:   We investigated the effects of the Akt inhibitor AZD5363 on cell proliferation, cell cycle, apoptosis, and Akt downstream pathway proteins. Survival mechanisms induced by AZD5363 were investigated. We then examined the impacts of inhibition of autophagy in combination with AZD5363 on cell proliferation and apoptosis. Furthermore, the anticancer activity of combination treatment of the lysosomotropic inhibitor of autophagy (chloroquine) with the Akt inhibitor AZD5363 was evaluated in PC-3 prostate cancer xenografts.  Results:   Here, we show that the Akt inhibitor AZD5363 affected the Akt downstream pathway by reducing p-mTOR, p-P70S6K, and p-S6K. While AZD5363 monotherapy induced G(2) growth arrest and autophagy, it failed to induce significant apoptosis in PC-3 and DU145 prostate cancer cell lines. Blocking autophagy using pharmacologic inhibitors (3-methyladenine, chloroquine, and bafilomycin A) or genetic inhibitors (siRNA targeting Atg3 and Atg7) enhanced cell death induced by Akt inhibitor AZD5363 in these tumor prostate cell lines. Importantly, the combination of AZD5363 with chloroquine significantly reduced tumor volume by 84.9% compared with the control group and by 77.5% compared with either drug alone in PC3 xenografts.  Conclusion:   Taken together, these data show that the Akt inhibitor AZD5363 synergizes with the lysosomotropic inhibitor of autophagy chloroquine to induce apoptosis and delay tumor progression in prostate cancer models that are resistant to monotherapy AZD5363, providing a new therapeutic approach potentially translatable to patients.""","""['Francois Lamoureux', 'Christian Thomas', 'Claire Crafter', 'Masafumi Kumano', 'Fan Zhang', 'Barry R Davies', 'Martin E Gleave', 'Amina Zoubeidi']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Clin Cancer Res""","""['Dual inhibition of autophagy and the AKT pathway in prostate cancer.', 'High Efficacy of Combination Therapy Using PI3K/AKT Inhibitors with Androgen Deprivation in Prostate Cancer Preclinical Models.', 'Akt inhibition promotes autophagy and sensitizes PTEN-null tumors to lysosomotropic agents.', ""Enhancing perifosine's anticancer efficacy by preventing autophagy."", 'Autophagy inhibitors.', 'PI5P4Kα supports prostate cancer metabolism and exposes a survival vulnerability during androgen receptor inhibition.', 'Combined treatments with AZD5363, AZD8542, curcumin or resveratrol induce death of human glioblastoma cells by suppressing the PI3K/AKT and SHH signaling pathways.', 'Recent Advances in the Role of Autophagy in Endocrine-Dependent Tumors.', 'Subversion of autophagy machinery and organelle-specific autophagy by SARS-CoV-2 and coronaviruses.', 'From Therapy Resistance to Targeted Therapies in Prostate Cancer.']"""

Positive nuclear staining of AR was detected in malignant epithelial cells. The levels of androstenedione (Adione), T, and 5-alpha dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in the serum of the patient were similar to those in PC patients receiving neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), but were higher in the patient's prostate than in PC patients not receiving ADT. The gene expression of CYP17A1 and HSD3B1 was not detected, whereas that of STS, HSD3B2, AKR1C3, SRD5A1, and SRD5A2 was detected. Moreover, cytoplasmic staining of HSD3B2, AKR1C3, SRD5A1, and SRD5A2 was detected in malignant epithelial cells. Hence, in the present case (a man with primary hypogonadism), steroidogenesis in PC tissues from adrenal androgens, especially dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate, was the mechanism accounting for progression of PC. This mechanism might help elucidate the development of castration-resistant PC.""","""['S Arai', 'Y Shibata', 'Y Nakamura', 'B Kashiwagi', 'T Uei', 'Y Tomaru', 'Y Miyashiro', 'S Honma', 'K Hashimoto', 'Y Sekine', 'K Ito', 'H Sasano', 'K Suzuki']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Andrology""","""['Evidence of limited contributions for intratumoral steroidogenesis in prostate cancer.', 'Increased expression of genes converting adrenal androgens to testosterone in androgen-independent prostate cancer.', 'Pharmacologic basis for the enhanced efficacy of dutasteride against prostatic cancers.', 'Sex steroid hormone metabolism and prostate cancer.', 'Castration-recurrent prostate cancer is not androgen-independent.', 'Testosterone Deficiency is Not Protective Against the Development of Adenocarcinoma of the Prostate in a Type\xa01 Diabetic Patient.', 'Dihydrotestosterone: Biochemistry, Physiology, and Clinical Implications of Elevated Blood Levels.', 'Characterization of Prostate Cancer in a Functional Eunuch.', 'The hunt for a selective 17,20 lyase inhibitor; learning lessons from nature.']"""

Among the six isoforms, Pak1 is the most ubiquitous and the best characterized member. Previous studies have shown that inhibition of Pak6, which is predominantly present in the prostate compared with other tissues, inhibits prostate tumor growth in vivo. Even though Pak1 has been identified in normal prostatic epithelial cells and cancer cells, its specific role in the development of prostate cancer remains unclear. We report here that highly invasive prostate cancer cells express significantly higher levels of Pak1 protein compared with non-invasive prostate cancer cells. Furthermore, prostate tumor tissues and prostate cancer metastasized to lungs showed a higher expression of Pak1 compared with normal tissues. Interestingly, Pak6 protein expression levels did not change with the invasive/metastatic potential of the cancer cells or tumors. Although inhibition of Pak1, and not Pak6, resulted in impaired PC3 cell migration, the effects of Pak1 knockdown on transendothelial migration (microinvasion), tumor growth, and tumor angiogenesis was higher compared with Pak6 knockdown. Finally, gene array data revealed reduced expression of matrix metalloproteinase 9 with the ablation of either Pak1 or Pak6 gene expression in PC3 cells, whereas protein levels of TGFβ was elevated significantly with specific modulation of Pak1 activity or ablation of the Pak1 gene. Our observations suggest that although some level of functional redundancy exists between Pak1 and Pak6 in prostate cancer cells, targeting Pak1 is a potential option for the management of prostate tumor growth, microinvasion, and metastasis.""","""['Anna Goc', 'Ahmad Al-Azayzih', 'Maha Abdalla', 'Belal Al-Husein', 'Sravankumar Kavuri', 'Jeffrey Lee', 'Kelvin Moses', 'Payaningal R Somanath']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Biol Chem""","""['P21 activated kinase-1 mediates transforming growth factor β1-induced prostate cancer cell epithelial to mesenchymal transition.', 'Targeting p21-activated kinase 1 inhibits growth and metastasis via Raf1/MEK1/ERK signaling in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cells.', 'p21-Activated kinase 6 (PAK6) inhibits prostate cancer growth via phosphorylation of androgen receptor and tumorigenic E3 ligase murine double minute-2 (Mdm2).', 'Molecular pathways: targeting p21-activated kinase 1 signaling in cancer--opportunities, challenges, and limitations.', ""p21-activated kinase 1: PAK'ed with potential."", 'Targeting P21-Activated Kinase-1 for Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'p21-Activated Kinase: Role in Gastrointestinal Cancer and Beyond.', 'Gadd45 in Neuronal Development, Function, and Injury.', 'Cisatracurium attenuates LPS-induced modulation of MMP3 and junctional protein expression in human microvascular endothelial cells.', 'Liposomes Targeting P21 Activated Kinase-1 (PAK-1) and Selective for Secretory Phospholipase A2 (sPLA2) Decrease Cell Viability and Induce Apoptosis in Metastatic Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Cells.']"""

In analyses of open source transcriptional microarray data, we find that PRSS3 expression is upregulated in metastatic prostate cancer tissue, and that expression of PRSS3 in primary prostate tumors is prognostic of systemic progression following prostatectomy. Using a mouse orthotopic model with bioluminescent imaging, we show that PRSS3/mesotrypsin is critical for prostate cancer metastasis. Silencing of PRSS3 inhibits anchorage-independent growth of prostate cancer cells in soft agar assays, and suppresses invasiveness in Matrigel transwell assays and three-dimensional (3D) cell culture models. We further show that treatment with recombinant mesotrypsin directly promotes an invasive cellular phenotype in prostate cancer cells and find that these effects are specific and require the proteolytic activity of mesotrypsin, because neither cationic trypsin nor a mesotrypsin mutant lacking activity can drive the invasive phenotype. Finally, we show that a newly developed, potent inhibitor of mesotrypsin activity can suppress prostate cancer cell invasion to a similar extent as PRSS3 gene silencing.

A matched pairs analysis was performed using our database to identify men with a pathologic prostate specimen weight ≤50 g but with equivalent clinicopathologic characteristics to serve as the control group (group B).  Results:   Our results indicated that although the intraoperative results were more than satisfying in patients with large glands, there is a significant increase in blood loss, operative time needed, increased need for bladder neck reconstruction as well as an increase in intraoperative complications. Nevertheless, patients with large glands exhibit less aggressive tumors, less positive surgical margins and a lower incidence of biochemical recurrence.

Herein, cell and human tumor xenograft models of prostate cancer were utilized to resolve the downstream pathways that are required for the protumorigenic functions of cyclin D1b. Specifically, cyclin D1b was found to modulate the expression of a large transcriptional network that cooperates with androgen receptor (AR) signaling to enhance tumor cell growth and invasive potential. Notably, cyclin D1b promoted AR-dependent activation of genes associated with metastatic phenotypes. Further exploration determined that transcriptional induction of SNAI2 (Slug) was essential for cyclin D1b-mediated proliferative and invasive properties, implicating Slug as a critical driver of disease progression. Importantly, cyclin D1b expression highly correlated with that of Slug in clinical samples of advanced disease. In vivo analyses provided strong evidence that Slug enhances both tumor growth and metastatic phenotypes.

The aim of the present trial was to investigate whether degarelix achieves comparable efficacy with that of goserelin plus bicalutamide as neoadjuvant therapy before radiotherapy.  Materials and methods:   The study was a randomised, parallel-arm, active-controlled, open-label trial in 244 men with a UICC prostate cancer TNM category T2b-T4, N0, M0, Gleason score ≥7, or prostate-specific antigen ≥10 ng/ml and a total prostate volume >30 ml, who were scheduled to undergo radical radiotherapy and in whom neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy was indicated. Eligible patients received treatment with either monthly degarelix (240/80 mg) or goserelin (3.6 mg) for 12 weeks, the latter patients also receiving bicalutamide (50 mg) for 17 days initially. The primary efficacy measure was the mean percentage reduction in total prostate volume from baseline at week 12 measured by transrectal ultrasound. The severity and relief of lower urinary tract symptoms were assessed by the International Prostate Symptom Score questionnaire. Quality of life was assessed by the eighth question of the International Prostate Symptom Score. About 50% of the patients had moderate to severe lower urinary tract symptoms at baseline.  Results:   The total prostate volume decreased significantly from baseline to week 12 in both treatment groups, reaching -36.0 ± 14.5% in degarelix-treated patients and -35.3 ± 16.7% in goserelin-treated patients (adjusted difference: -0.3%; 95% confidence interval: -4.74; 4.14%).

Main outcome measures:   Familial risks of the concordant cancers by age at diagnosis.  Results:   The highest familial risk was seen for offspring whose parents were diagnosed at an early age. Familial risks were significantly increased for colorectal, lung, breast, prostate, and urinary bladder cancer and melanoma, skin squamous cell carcinoma, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, even when parents were diagnosed at age 70-79 or 80-89.

Conclusion:   Though the highest familial risks of cancer are seen in offspring whose parents received a diagnosis of a concordant cancer at earlier ages, increased risks exist even in cancers of advanced ages.

Therefore, the aim of the present study was to generate prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)×CD3 diabodies as a novel treatment option for this tumor.  Methods:   A PSMA×CD3 diabody and a covalently linked single-chain diabody were constructed from the anti-PSMA single-chain Fv fragment D7 and an anti-CD3 single-chain Fv fragment. The fusion proteins were periplasmatically expressed in Escherichia coli. The binding properties were tested on PSMA-expressing C4-2 prostate cancer cells and CD3(+) Jurkat cells by flow cytometry. For in vitro functional analysis, a cell viability assay was used. T-cell activation was determined by flow cytometry. In vivo activity of the diabody was tested in SCID mice reconstituted with human peripheral blood lymphocytes bearing C4-2 tumor xenografts.  Results:   Bacterial expression levels were significantly higher for the diabody (1-1.5 mg/l culture) compared with the single-chain diabody (0.2-0.4 mg/l culture). Specific binding on CD3-expressing Jurkat cells and PSMA-expressing C4-2 cells was shown with both diabody formats. In vitro, both diabodies proved to be potent agents for retargeting human CD4(+) and CD8(+) lymphocytes to lyse C4-2 prostate cancer cells. The formation of conjugates between T cells and target cells with clustering of the diabody at sites of interaction could be shown. SCID mice reconstituted with human peripheral blood lymphocytes bearing C4-2 tumor xenografts with the diabody showed an efficient inhibition of tumor growth.

Results:   The tested complexes displayed a stronger cytotoxic effect against all the cancer cells as compared to cisplatin. The highest cytotoxicity was found for the complexes 4 (IC50 = 0.36 ± 0.05 μM and 0.56 ± 0.15 μM), 5 (IC50 = 0.66 ± 0.07 μM and 0.73 ± 0.08 μM) and 6 (IC50 = 0.57 ± 0.11 μM and 0.70 ± 0.20 μM) against A2780, and A2780cis respectively, as compared with the values of 12.0 ± 0.8 μM and 27.0 ± 4.6 μM determined for cisplatin. Moreover, the tested complexes were much less cytotoxic to primary human hepatocytes than to the cancer cells. The complexes 5 and 6 exhibited significantly high ability to modulate secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α (2873 ± 238 pg/mL and 3284 ± 139 pg/mL for 5, and 6 respectively) and IL-1β (1177 ± 128 pg/mL and 1087 ± 101 pg/mL for 5, and 6 respectively) tested on the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated THP-1 cells as compared with the values of 1173 ± 85 pg/mL and 118.5 ± 4.8 pg/mL found for the commercially used anti-inflammatory drug prednisone. The ability of the tested complexes to interact with sulfur-containing biomolecules (cysteine and reduced glutathione) at physiological levels was proved by electrospray-ionization mass spectrometry.

However, little is known about the mechanism by which piceatannol inhibits invasion and metastasis. The aim of the current study was to investigate the effects of piceatannol on the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) in DU145 human prostate cancer cells. The results revealed that MMP-9 activity was significantly increased in response to tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). However, treatment with piceatannol reversed TNF-α- and MMP-9-induced gelatin zymography and its gene expression. In addition, a Matrigel invasion assay determined that piceatannol reduces the TNF-α-induced invasion of DU145 cells. Nuclear factor-κ B (NF-κB) is a significant transcription factor that regulates numerous genes involved in tumor cell invasion and metastasis. Therefore, whether piceatannol acts on NF-κB to regulate MMP-9 gene expression was analyzed. The results revealed that piceatannol attenuates MMP-9 gene expression via the suppression of NF-κB activity. Using a specific NF-κB inhibitor, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate, it was confirmed that TNF-α-induced MMP-9 gene expression is primarily regulated by NF-κB activation. Piceatannol inhibited NF-κB activity by suppressing nuclear translocation of the NF-κB p65 and p50 subunits. Furthermore, TNF-α-induced Akt phosphorylation was significantly downregulated in the presence of piceatannol. The Akt inhibitor LY294002 caused a significant decrease in TNF-α-induced NF-κB activity and MMP-9 gene expression.

The reported DNA methylation in the promoter of APC varies greatly among studies of colorectal cancer (CRC) in different populations. Insulin-like growth factor binding protein 7 (IGFBP7), also known as IGFBP-related protein 1 (IGFBP-rP1), is expressed in various tissue types, including the lung, brain, prostate and gastrointestinal tract, and has been suggested to play a tumour suppressor role against colorectal carcinogenesis. Studies have indicated that IGFBP7 is inactivated by DNA methylation in human colon, lung and breast cancer. In the present study, we used the methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction to study the methylation status of the APC and IGFBP7 gene promoters in cancerous and paired normal tissue to evaluate its impact on clinical factors and association with ethnicity, represented by Swedish and Vietnamese CRC patients. We also investigated the distribution of CpG islands and the CpG dinucleotide density of each CpG island in the regions which were the subject of our investigation. Overall, normal tissue from Swedish patients exhibited a significantly higher frequency of IGFBP7 gene methylation in comparison with that of Vietnamese patients. Moreover, a significantly higher number of cancer tissues from Vietnamese individuals showed higher levels of methylation versus the paired normal tissue compared with that of Swedish patients. When we studied the methylation in cancer compared with the matched normal tissue in individuals, we found that a significantly higher number of Vietnamese patients had a higher degree of IGFBP7 gene methylation in cancer versus matched normal tissue in comparison with Swedish patients. Taken together, our results suggest that the methylation of the APC and IGFBP7 gene promoter region in cancerous tissue, in combination with the predominance of methylation in normal tissue, may serve as a prognostic factor in CRC patients.""","""['Jan Dimberg', 'Thai Trinh Hong', 'Marita Skarstedt', 'Sture Löfgren', 'Niklas Zar', 'Andreas Matussek']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Oncol Lett""","""['APC Promoter Methylation in Gastrointestinal Cancer.', 'APC hypermethylation for early diagnosis of colorectal cancer: a meta-analysis and literature review.', 'Methylation profile of the promoter CpG islands of 31 genes that may contribute to colorectal carcinogenesis.', 'IGFBP7 is a p53-responsive gene specifically silenced in colorectal cancer with CpG island methylator phenotype.', 'Detection of cytomegalovirus DNA in colorectal tissue from Swedish and Vietnamese patients with colorectal cancer.', 'APC Promoter Methylation in Gastrointestinal Cancer.', 'Disparities in prostate cancer incidence and mortality rates: Solvable or not?', 'APC hypermethylation for early diagnosis of colorectal cancer: a meta-analysis and literature review.', 'Construction of a Dual-Fluorescence Reporter System to Monitor the Dynamic Progression of Pluripotent Cell Differentiation.', 'Molecular characteristics of colorectal serrated polyps and hyperplastic polyps: A STROBE compliant article.']"""

Suppression of sAC activity by treatment with the sAC-specific inhibitor KH7 or by sAC-specific knockdown mediated by siRNA or shRNA transfection prevented the proliferation of prostate carcinoma cells, led to lactate dehydrogenase release, and induced apoptosis. Cell cycle analysis revealed a significant rise in the G(2) phase population 12 h after sAC inhibition, which was accompanied by the down-regulation of cyclin B(1) and CDK1. sAC-dependent regulation of proliferation involves the EPAC/Rap1/B-Raf signaling pathway.

Methods:   Our LNCaP cells had been stably transfected with lentivirus-mediated shRNA for PSMA silencing in previous study. We first testify the efficacy of PSMA knockdown in our LNCaP cell line.

Then, cell viability and migration were measured by cell counting kit-8 reagent and Transwell analysis respectively. Flow cytometry was employed to evaluate cell survival.  Results:   After silencing the expression of PSMA, the level of the phospho-p38 (P-p38) decreased approximate 40% compared with the blank and NC groups (P < 0.05).

Although hormonotherapy and radiotherapy (RT) represent valid therapies for prostate cancer treatment, novel immunological approaches have been explored. The development of clinical trials employing cancer vaccines has indicated that immune response to tumor antigens can be boosted and that vaccine administration can improve patient survival. Immune response to tumor antigens could also be enhanced after standard therapies. In the present study, we determined the occurrence of antibodies to extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules, heat shock protein (HSP), ribosomal P0 protein, EGFR, ErbB2 and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in 35 prostate cancer patients prior to and following local RT and hormonotherapy. We demonstrated that immunity to P0, ECM molecules [collagens (C) CI, CIII, CV, fibronectin (FN) and laminin (LM)] and to HSP90 was associated with malignancy in untreated patients. None of the patient sera showed antibodies to EGFR, while 2 and 1 patients showed reactivity to ErbB2 and PSA, respectively. We also demonstrated that 8 months after therapy the IgG serum levels to CI, CIII, FN and HSP90 significantly decreased. Conversely, the level of P0 autoantibodies increased after therapy in 10 patients. Five of the 10 patients with increased levels of P0 autoantibodies were treated with RT plus hormonotherapy. Treatment of patients did not change the levels of antibodies against EGFR, ErbB2 and PSA. Our results indicated that the modification of antibody level to self molecules after standard treatment of prostate cancer patients is influenced by the type of antigen. Ribosomal P0 protein appears to be a high immunogenic antigen and its immunogenicity increases following RT. In addition, 10 patients with increased levels of autoantibodies to P0 showed PSA mean levels lower than the remaining 25 patients at 18 months. This study may contribute to a better understanding of the immunobiological behavior of prostate cancer patients following standard treatment.""","""['Gianluca Ingrosso', 'Massimo Fantini', 'Alessandra Nardi', 'Monica Benvenuto', 'Pamela Sacchetti', 'Laura Masuelli', 'Elisabetta Ponti', 'Giovanni Vanni Frajese', 'Florigio Lista', 'Orazio Schillaci', 'Riccardo Santoni', 'Andrea Modesti', 'Roberto Bei']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Oncol Rep""","""['Natural humoral immune response to ribosomal P0 protein in colorectal cancer patients.', 'Autoantibodies reactive with extracellular matrix proteins in patients with thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy.', 'Positive associations between galectin-3 and PSA levels in prostate cancer patients: a prospective clinical study-I.', 'Clinical experience with CD64-directed immunotherapy.

In recent years, several inhibitors of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTis) have been developed and evaluated in pre-clinical models and in clinical trials. While these compounds are effective in the treatment of hematological conditions, clinical trials in solid tumors and in prostate cancer have shown limited or no efficacy. This may be attributed to inappropriate dose regimens leading to toxicity-related adverse events. As with other anti-target compounds, one of the obstacles encountered with DNMTis in prostate cancer could be the inability to select patients for the clinical studies as well as the inability to monitor the efficacy of the drug if not the conclusion of the study. Primary cultures derived from human prostatic tissues harvested from patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and prostate cancer (PCa) as well as neoplastic and non-neoplastic prostate cell lines were tested for DNMT expression/activity and to monitor azacitidine molecular efficacy. We observed that in primary cultures the levels of DNMT activity as well as the protein levels of DNMT1, DNMT3a and DNMT3b were higher in cultures derived from PCa compared to BPH tissue samples and significantly higher in cultures derived from PCa with Gleason scores ≥7 compared to those observed in cultures derived from Gleason scores <7. In addition, DNMT activity as well as DNMT1, DNMT3a and DNMT3b levels were higher in PCa cell lines compared to their non-neoplastic counterparts. Although DNMT activity was higher in high tumorigenic/aggressive PCa cell lines compared to low tumorigenic/aggressive cell lines, only the levels of DNMT3a and DNMT3b were significantly higher in the first group of cells, suggesting that DNMT1 activity is related to the transition to non-neoplastic versus neoplastic phenotype whereas the de novo methylation enzymes were mainly related to progression. Nevertheless, the comparison in the more aggressive PC3 cell derivatives (PC3-LN4 cells) also possessed higher levels of DNMT1 compared to PC3 and PC3M from which these cells were derived. Collectively, our results confirm previous data on the increased methylation in more aggressive tumors supporting the use of DNMTis in advanced prostate cancer. In addition, since glutathione S-transferase-π (GSTP1) was re-expressed or its protein levels were increased after treatment with non-toxic azacitidine doses and since GSTP1 can easily be measured in patient sera, the monitoring of this protein may aide in the evaluation of therapy in future clinical trials.""","""['Giovanni Luca Gravina', 'Guido Ranieri', 'Paola Muzi', 'Francesco Marampon', 'Andrea Mancini', 'Boris Di Pasquale', 'Luigi Di Clemente', 'Vincenza Dolo', ""Anna Maria D'Alessandro"", 'Claudio Festuccia']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Oncol Rep""","""['Inhibition of DNA methyltransferase activity prevents tumorigenesis in a mouse model of prostate cancer.', 'Correlation between the expression of DNMT1, and GSTP1 and APC, and the methylation status of GSTP1 and APC in association with their clinical significance in prostate cancer.', 'Phenotypic characterization of human prostatic stromal cells in primary cultures derived from human tissue samples.', 'Preneoplastic prostate lesions: an opportunity for prostate cancer prevention.', 'Oxidative stress in prostate hypertrophy and carcinogenesis.', 'Alterations in the Epigenetic Machinery Associated with Prostate Cancer Health Disparities.', 'Crosstalk between miRNAs and DNA Methylation in Cancer.', 'Mechanistic Insights into Harmine-Mediated Inhibition of Human DNA Methyltransferases and Prostate Cancer Cell Growth.', 'Chemopreventive Activity of Ellagitannins from Acer pseudosieboldianum (Pax) Komarov Leaves on Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'MGL S3 Chimeric Enzyme Drives Apoptotic Death of EGFR-Dependent Cancer Cells through ERK Downregulation.']"""

AND WHAT DOES THE STUDY ADD?: Erectile dysfunction after nerve-sparing radical retropubic prostatectomy constitutes a challenge to the urologist. The mainstay of medical treatment after radical prostatectomy to restore spontaneous erectile function remains phosphodiesterase (PDE5) inhibitors, despite the fact that data from animal studies suggesting that PDE5 inhibitors can prevent smooth muscle apoptosis and fibrosis have not yet been extrapolated to humans because of a lack of standardized protocols. If the above treatment fails, second-line therapies such as intraurethral prostaglandins, penile injection therapy and vacuum devices are offered. When less invasive therapies are ineffective, interventions that preserve sexual function such as penile prosthesis implantation become the treatment of choice. Our study reveals the alternative of penile prosthesis implantation as first-line treatment in erectile dysfunction after nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy. It also highlights its superiority to the oral PDE5 inhibitor treatment, regarding the erection, frequency, firmness, maintenance and penetration ability. This suggests that a concept of an early penile intervention in the future would be promising for those patients who wish to remain sexually active without depending on oral formulations with doubtful and delayed results.  Objective:   To evaluate the outcome of penile prosthesis surgery in comparison to oral phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitor administration, in men with erectile dysfunction after nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy, as early penile intervention therapy.  Patients and methods:   A total of 174 patients treated by nerve-sparing retropubic radical prostatectomy (RRP) for clinically localized prostate cancer, between January 2006 and September 2009 enrolled in the study, 153 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria, and 69 (45%) patients presented with post-RRP erectile dysfunction 6 months after primary surgery. Fifty-four patients were disease-free and subdivided into two arms according to treatment modality, either tadalafil three times/week or penile prosthesis implantation. All patients were evaluated using the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) questionnaire preoperatively and at 6, 12 and 24 month postoperatively. Repeated measurements analysis of variance was conducted to evaluate the effect of time and group on IIEF total score.  Results:   There was a significant reduction in IIEF score from preoperative values to the first measurement after surgery in both treatment groups. The overall degree of change from the first time point immediately after surgery to 2 years was greater in the penile prosthesis group than the tadalafil group (20.4 ± 1.3 vs 8.1 ± 2.4, P < 0.001).  Conclusions:   The efficacy and satisfaction results of both treatment types are considered acceptable. However, regarding the erection frequency, firmness, penetration ability, maintenance and erection confidence it seems that penile prosthesis implantation is superior to oral treatment. The concept of early penile intervention should be considered and is promising for all patients with post-RRP erectile dysfunction.""","""['Georgios Megas', 'Georgios Papadopoulos', 'Georgios Stathouros', 'Dimitrios Moschonas', 'Ioannis Gkialas', 'Konstantinos Ntoumas']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Effects of tadalafil treatment on erectile function recovery following bilateral nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy: a randomised placebo-controlled study (REACTT).', 'Optimal strategy for penile rehabilitation after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy based on preoperative erectile function.', 'Nightly vs on-demand sildenafil for penile rehabilitation after minimally invasive nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy: results of a randomized double-blind trial with placebo.', 'Erectile function after radical prostatectomy.', 'Efficacy and safety of phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors in treating erectile dysfunction after bilateral nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy.', 'Surgical tips in difficult penile prosthetic surgery: a narrative review.', 'Penile implants: a look into the future.', 'Interventions to address sexual problems in people with cancer.', 'Erectile dysfunction post-radical prostatectomy - a challenge for both patient and physician.', 'Pharmacologic and surgical therapies for sexual dysfunction in male cancer survivors.']"""

Materials and methods:   After merging the NIS (Nationwide Inpatient Sample) and the AHA (American Hospital Association) survey from 2006 to 2008, we identified 29,837 patients with prostate cancer who underwent radical prostatectomy. The primary outcome was treatment with radical prostatectomy at hospitals that have adopted robotic surgery. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify patient and hospital characteristics associated with radical prostatectomy performed at hospitals with robotic surgery.  Results:   Overall 20,424 (68.5%) patients were surgically treated with radical prostatectomy at hospitals with robotic surgery, while 9,413 (31.5%) underwent radical prostatectomy at hospitals without robotic surgery. There was a marked increase in radical prostatectomy at hospital adopters from 55.8% in 2006 and 70.7% in 2007 to 76.1% in 2008 (p <0.001 for trend). After adjusting for patient and hospital features, lower odds of undergoing radical prostatectomy at hospitals with robotic surgery were seen in black patients (OR 0.81, p <0.001) and Hispanic patients (OR 0.77, p <0.001) vs white patients. Compared to having private health insurance, being primarily insured with Medicaid (OR 0.70, p <0.001) was also associated with lower odds of being treated at hospitals with robotic surgery.  Conclusions:   Although there was a rapid shift of patients who underwent radical prostatectomy to hospitals with robotic surgery from 2006 to 2008, black and Hispanic patients or those primarily insured by Medicaid were less likely to undergo radical prostatectomy at such hospitals.""","""['Simon P Kim', 'Stephen A Boorjian', 'Nilay D Shah', 'Christopher J Weight', 'Jon C Tilburt', 'Leona C Han', 'R Houston Thompson', 'Quoc-Dien Trinh', 'Maxine Sun', 'James P Moriarty', 'R Jeffrey Karnes']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Editorial comment.', 'Pretreatment expectations of patients undergoing robotic assisted laparoscopic or open retropubic radical prostatectomy.', 'Hospitalization costs for radical prostatectomy attributable to robotic surgery.', 'A comparison of the incidence and location of positive surgical margins in robotic assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy and open retropubic radical prostatectomy.', 'Laparoscopic radical prostatectomy: conventional and robotic.', 'Robotic assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy: a review of the current state of affairs.', 'Exploring the complexity and spectrum of racial/ethnic disparities in colon cancer management.', 'Disparities in access to robotic technology and perioperative outcomes among patients treated with radical prostatectomy.', 'Did ethno-racial disparities in access to transcatheter aortic valve replacement change over time?', 'Can PROMs improve racial equity in outcomes after prostatectomy?', 'Are there disparities in access to robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery among pediatric urology patients?

In this study, we aimed to delineate the impact of snake venom extracted from Walterinnesia aegyptia (WEV) alone or in combination with silica nanoparticles (WEV+NP) on primary MM cells isolated from patients diagnosed with MM as well as on two MM cell lines, U266 and RPMI 8226. The IC(50) values of WEV and WEV+NP that significantly decreased MM cell viability without affecting the viability of normal peripheral mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were determined to be 25 ng/ml and 10 ng/ml, respectively. Although both WEV (25 ng/ml) and WEV+NP (10 ng/ml) decreased the CD54 surface expression without affecting the expression of CXCR4 (CXCL12 receptor) on MM cells, they significantly reduced the ability of CXC chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12) to induce actin cytoskeleton rearrangement and the subsequent reduction in chemotaxis. It has been established that the binding of CXCL12 to its receptor CXCR4 activates multiple intracellular signal transduction pathways that regulate MM cell chemotaxis, adhesion, and proliferation. We found that WEV and WEV+NP clearly decreased the CXCL12/CXCR4-mediated activation of AKT, ERK, NFκB and Rho-A using western blot analysis; abrogated the CXCL12-mediated proliferation of MM cells using the CFSE assay; and induced apoptosis in MM cell as determined by PI/annexin V double staining followed by flow cytometry analysis. Monitoring the expression of B-cell CCL/Lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) family members and their role in apoptosis induction after treatment with WEV or WEV+NP revealed that the combination of WEV with NP robustly decreased the expression of the anti-apoptotic effectors Bcl-2, Bcl(XL) and Mcl-1; conversely increased the expression of the pro-apoptotic effectors Bak, Bax and Bim; and altered the mitochondrial membrane potential in MM cells.

Our recent results from a systematic chemical biology sensitivity screen covering most known drugs and drug-like molecules indicated that aldehyde dehydrogenase inhibitor disulfiram is one of the most potent cancer-specific inhibitors of prostate cancer cell growth, including TMPRSS2-ERG fusion positive cancers. However, the results revealed that disulfiram alone does not block tumor growth in vivo nor induce apoptosis in vitro, indicating that combinatorial approaches may be required to enhance the anti-neoplastic effects.  Methods and findings:   In this study, we utilized a chemical biology drug sensitivity screen to explore disulfiram mechanistic details and to identify compounds potentiating the effect of disulfiram in TMPRSS2-ERG fusion positive prostate cancer cells. In total, 3357 compounds including current chemotherapeutic agents as well as drug-like small molecular compounds were screened alone and in combination with disulfiram. Interestingly, the results indicated that androgenic and antioxidative compounds antagonized disulfiram effect whereas inhibitors of receptor tyrosine kinase, proteasome, topoisomerase II, glucosylceramide synthase or cell cycle were among compounds sensitizing prostate cancer cells to disulfiram. The combination of disulfiram and an antiangiogenic agent sunitinib was studied in more detail, since both are already in clinical use in humans. Disulfiram-sunitinib combination induced apoptosis and reduced androgen receptor protein expression more than either of the compounds alone. Moreover, combinatorial exposure reduced metastatic characteristics such as cell migration and 3D cell invasion as well as induced epithelial differentiation shown as elevated E-cadherin expression.  Conclusions:   Taken together, our results propose novel combinatorial approaches to inhibit prostate cancer cell growth. Disulfiram-sunitinib combination was identified as one of the potent synergistic approaches. Since sunitinib alone has been reported to lack efficacy in prostate cancer clinical trials, our results provide a rationale for novel combinatorial approach to target prostate cancer more efficiently.""","""['Kirsi Ketola', 'Olli Kallioniemi', 'Kristiina Iljin']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Preclinical evaluation of sunitinib, a multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor, as a radiosensitizer for human prostate cancer.', 'Synergistic antitumor effect of NVP-BEZ235 and sunitinib on docetaxel-resistant human castration-resistant prostate cancer cells.', 'Differential sensitivity of prostate tumor derived endothelial cells to sorafenib and sunitinib.', 'Novel therapies for metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Sunitinib: from rational design to clinical efficacy.', 'Mouse pharmacokinetics and metabolism of the phenylurea thiocarbamate NSC 161128.', 'Molecular and Functional Links between Neurodevelopmental Processes and Treatment-Induced Neuroendocrine Plasticity in Prostate Cancer Progression.', 'Targeting NPL4 via drug repositioning using disulfiram for the treatment of clear cell renal cell carcinoma.', 'EGF and IGF1 affect sunitinib activity in BP-NEN: new putative targets beyond VEGFR?', 'Cellular plasticity and the neuroendocrine phenotype in prostate cancer.']"""

Recent studies suggest that phenotypic changes associated with cancer may be transferred from cell-to-cell via microvesicles/exosomes. Here we aimed to investigate phenotypic changes associated with docetaxel-resistance in order to help determine the complexity of this problem and to assess the relevance of secreted exosomes in prostate cancer.  Methodology/principal findings:   Docetaxel-resistant variants of DU145 and 22Rv1 were established and characterised in terms of cross-resistance, morphology, proliferation, motility, invasion, anoikis, colony formation, exosomes secretion their and functional relevance. Preliminary analysis of exosomes from relevant serum specimens was also performed. Acquired docetaxel-resistance conferred cross-resistance to doxorubicin and induced alterations in motility, invasion, proliferation and anchorage-independent growth. Exosomes expelled from DU145 and 22Rv1 docetaxel-resistant variants (DU145RD and 22Rv1RD) conferred docetaxel-resistance to DU145, 22Rv1 and LNCap cells, which may be partly due to exosomal MDR-1/P-gp transfer. Exosomes from prostate cancer patients' sera induced increased cell proliferation and invasion, compared to exosomes from age-matched controls. Furthermore, exosomes from sera of patients undergoing a course of docetaxel treatment compared to matched exosomes from the same patients prior to commencing docetaxel treatment, when applied to both DU145 and 22Rv1 cells, showed a correlation between cellular response to docetaxel and patients' response to treatment with docetaxel.  Conclusions/significance:   Our studies indicate the complex and multifaceted nature of docetaxel-resistance in prostate cancer.

Since this is yet unclear for prostate cancer, we investigated IR isoform composition and IRS balance in prostate cancer compared to benign and tumor adjacent benign prostate tissue and brought this into relation to cell proliferation.  Methods:   We studied 23 benign prostate samples from radical cystectomy or benign prostatic hyperplasia surgery, 30 samples from benign tissue directly adjacent to prostate cancer foci and 35 cancer samples from different patients. RNA expression levels for insulin receptor isoforms A and B, IRS-1, IRS-2, and IGF-1 receptor were assessed by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. In addition, RNA- and protein expression of the cell cycle regulator p27(Kip1) was quantified by real-time RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry.  Results:   Insulin receptor isoform A to B ratio was significantly higher in cancer as well as in tumor adjacent benign prostate tissue compared to purely benign prostates (p<0.05). IRS-1 to IRS-2 ratios were lower in malignant than in benign prostatic tissue (p<0.05). These altered ratios both in cancer and adjacent tissue were significantly associated with reduced p27(Kip1) content (p<0.02). Interestingly, IGF-1 receptor levels were significantly lower in patients with type 2 diabetes (p = 0.0019).  Conclusions/interpretation:   We found significant differences in the insulin signaling cascade between benign prostate tissue and prostate cancer.

Thus, the objective of this study was to determine whether ARBs are associated with an overall increased risk of the four most common cancers, namely, lung, colorectal, breast and prostate cancers, and to explore these effects separately for each cancer type. We conducted a retrospective cohort study using a nested case-control analysis within the United Kingdom (UK) General Practice Research Database. We assembled a cohort of patients prescribed antihypertensive agents between 1995, the year the first ARB (losartan) entered the UK market, and 2008, with follow-up until December 31, 2010. Cases were patients newly-diagnosed with lung, colorectal, breast and prostate cancer during follow-up. We used conditional logistic regression to estimate adjusted rate ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of cancer incidence, comparing ever use of ARBs with ever use of diuretics and/or beta-blockers. The cohort included 1,165,781 patients, during which 41,059 patients were diagnosed with one of the cancers under study (rate 554/100,000 person-years). When compared to diuretics and/or beta-blockers, ever use of ARBs was not associated with an increased rate of cancer overall (RR: 1.00; 95% CI: 0.96-1.03) or with each cancer site separately. The use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium channel blockers was associated with an increased rate of lung cancer (RR: 1.13; 95% CI: 1.06-1.20 and RR: 1.19; 95% CI: 1.12-1.27, respectively).

Sensitivity and specificity for MTT were 77% and 100% at 1.5 T (cutoff ratio, 0.7) and 70% and 100% at 3 T (cutoff ratio, 0.6), respectively. We found no significant relationship between the Gleason score and PF/MTT (P = 0.17/0.11 for 1.5 T and P = 0.23/0.18 for 3 T).  Conclusions:   The differentiation between PC and the normal tissue is possible with both field strengths. Prostate cancer can be better distinguished from prostatitis at 3 T compared with 1.5 T. The differentiation between prostatitis and the normal tissue is limited at both field strengths.""","""['Metin Sertdemir', 'Stefan O Schoenberg', 'Steven Sourbron', 'Daniel Hausmann', 'Julia Heinzelbecker', 'Henrik J Michaely', 'Dietmar J Dinter', 'Anja M Weidner']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Invest Radiol""","""['Evaluation of normal prostate tissue, chronic prostatitis, and prostate cancer by quantitative perfusion analysis using a dynamic contrast-enhanced inversion-prepared dual-contrast gradient echo sequence.', 'Prostate MR imaging: tissue characterization with pharmacokinetic volume and blood flow parameters and correlation with histologic parameters.', 'Pharmacokinetic MRI of the prostate: parameters for differentiating low-grade and high-grade prostate cancer.', 'MR imaging of prostate cancer.', 'Prostate cancer and its mimics at multiparametric prostate MRI.', 'Diagnostic value of 3.0 T versus 1.5 T MRI in staging prostate cancer: systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Factors Influencing Variability in the Performance of Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Detecting Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Literature Review.', 'Accuracy of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging for diagnosing prostate Cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'A meta-analysis of use of Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System Version 2 (PI-RADS V2) with multiparametric MR imaging for the detection of prostate cancer.', 'DCE MRI of prostate cancer.']"""

The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of NHT prior to LRP for locally confined prostate cancer.  Methods:   From January 2004 to September 2009, 342 patients undergoing LRP were analyzed, specifically comparing 72 patients who received NHT to 270 who did not. All patients were in clinical stage T2 and nerve sparing LRP were not included.  Results:   The mean patient age, preoperative prostate specific antigen (PSA), clinical stage, and biopsy Gleason grade were similar for the NHT and the non-NHT LRP groups. The median blood loss and the median operative time were also similar. There were no differences in the intraoperative complication rate of rectum injury, blood transfusion, and open surgery conversion. The positive surgical margin rate was significantly improved in NHT patients. Moreover, PSA recurrence within two years was significantly less in long-term NHT than in non-NHT patients.  Conclusions:   LRP was shown as a safe and efficacious procedure in patients who have received NHT.

We have previously shown that DNA vaccines encoding native prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP) were able to elicit PAP-specific T cells in both rats and humans, but required multiple immunization courses. In this study, we investigated in a preclinical model whether immunizations with a DNA vaccine encoding a xenoantigen could elicit a cross-reactive immune response to the native protein, potentially requiring fewer immunizations. Lewis rats were immunized with a DNA vaccine encoding human PAP and splenocytes from immunized rats were screened with a human peptide library containing overlapping, 15-mer PAP-derived peptides using T-cell proliferation and interferon γ (IFNγ) release as measures of the immune response. One dominant PAP-specific, RT1.A(l)-restricted, epitope was identified. Direct immunization with the immunodominant peptide (HP(201-215)) containing this epitope demonstrated that it included a naturally presented MHC Class I epitope recognized by CD8(+) T cells in Lewis rats. However, no cross-reactive immune response was elicited to the corresponding rat peptide despite a difference of only three amino acids. Immunization with DNA vaccines encoding rat PAP (rPAP) in which this foreign dominant epitope was included as well as with DNA vaccines coding for a variant of the xenoantigen from which this epitope was deleted, did not elicit responses to the native antigen. Overall, these results indicate that the immunization with a xenoantigen-coding DNA vaccine can lead to an immune response which potentially favors foreign epitopes and hence limits any cross-reactive response to the native antigen.""","""['Laura E Johnson', 'Thomas P Frye', 'Douglas G McNeel']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Oncoimmunology""","""['Plasmid DNA vaccine encoding prostatic acid phosphatase is effective in eliciting autologous antigen-specific CD8+ T cells.', 'Identification of prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP) specific HLA-DR1-restricted T-cell epitopes.', 'HLA-A2-restricted T-cell epitopes specific for prostatic acid phosphatase.', 'DNA vaccine encoding prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP) elicits long-term T-cell responses in patients with recurrent prostate cancer.', 'Progress toward an artificial vaccine for HIV: identification of helper and cytotoxic T-cell epitopes and methods of immunization.', 'DNA vaccines for prostate cancer.', 'DNA vaccination for prostate cancer: key concepts and considerations.', 'Variable epitope library carrying heavily mutated survivin-derived CTL epitope variants as a new class of efficient vaccine immunogen tested in a mouse model of breast cancer.', 'Presence of antigen-specific somatic allelic mutations and splice variants do not predict for immunological response to genetic vaccination.', 'DNA vaccines encoding altered peptide ligands for SSX2 enhance epitope-specific CD8+ T-cell immune responses.']"""

Aside from the pathophysiological effects, almost nothing is known about the cellular function of MCJ. Here, we provide the first evidence that MCJ acts in the biogenesis of mitochondria. Our results demonstrate that MCJ is located in mitochondria. It is anchored in the mitochondrial inner membrane with the C-terminal J domain facing the matrix space. We show that MCJ forms a stable subcomplex with a component of the mitochondrial import motor, MAGMAS, a protein overexpressed in cells treated with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and in prostate carcinomas. In addition, MCJ and MAGMAS interact with the core components of the TIM23 pre-protein translocase. We demonstrate that the recombinant soluble MCJ domain stimulates the ATPase activity of the human mtHsp70 chaperone, mortalin, the central component of the import motor of the TIM23 translocase. This stimulation is counteracted by MAGMAS. Moreover, pre-protein import into mitochondria is impaired in the absence of MCJ. Interestingly, MCJ is able to take over the function of Tim14, the essential J co-chaperone of the mitochondrial protein import motor in yeast. In summary, our results show that MCJ functions as J co-chaperone of the human TIM23 pre-protein translocase, suggesting a link between mitochondrial pre-protein import and tumorigenesis.""","""['Christina Schusdziarra', 'Marta Blamowska', 'Abdussalam Azem', 'Kai Hell']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Hum Mol Genet""","""['Functional Diversity of Human Mitochondrial J-proteins Is Independent of Their Association with the Inner Membrane Presequence Translocase.', 'Association of the Tim14.Tim16 subcomplex with the TIM23 translocase is crucial for function of the mitochondrial protein import motor.', 'The import motor of the yeast mitochondrial TIM23 preprotein translocase contains two different J proteins, Tim14 and Mdj2.', 'Cooperation of translocase complexes in mitochondrial protein import.', 'How to get to the other side of the mitochondrial inner membrane - the protein import motor.', 'Regulation of p53 and Cancer Signaling by Heat Shock Protein 40/J-Domain Protein Family Members.', 'Mitochondrial chaperones in human health and disease.', 'Ablation of mitochondrial DNA results in widespread remodeling of the mitochondrial complexome.', 'Dense sampling of bird diversity increases power of comparative genomics.', ""Genome-wide epigenetic analyses in Japanese immigrant plantation workers with Parkinson's disease and exposure to organochlorines reveal possible involvement of glial genes and pathways involved in neurotoxicity.""]"""

Methods:   A cohort of women from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial with abnormal ovarian results at the initial (T0) and subsequent (T1+) screens were analyzed to estimate which findings were associated with high risk of ovarian cancer. Cancer risks more than 10% were designated as high and risks of 3% or less were designated as low.  Results:   For the T0 screen, two high-risk categories were identified: CA 125 of 70 or more with negative transvaginal ultrasound scan (positive predictive value [PPV] 15.9%, CI 14.7-17.7%); and positive for both CA 125 and transvaginal ultrasound scan (PPV 25.0%, CI 23.3-27.3%).

T1+ criteria yielded a sensitivity of 85.3%, specificity of 95.6%, PPV of 29.6%, and NPV of 99.7%.  Conclusions:   High-risk categories for predicting risk of cancer in women with abnormal CA 125, transvaginal ultrasound scan, or both at initial and subsequent screens have been identified. The large number of women in this study, the 4-year complete follow-up, and small number of invasive cancers in the low-risk categories provide guidance for clinical decisions regarding need for surgery in these women.

Here we have investigated whether the expression levels of FAAH and CB1 receptors influence the prognostic value of markers of angiogenesis in prostate cancer. Data from a cohort of 419 patients who were diagnosed with prostate cancer at transurethral resection for lower urinary tract symptoms, of whom approximately 2/3 had been followed by expectancy, were used. Scores for the angiogenesis markers endoglin and von Willebrand factor (vWf), the endocannabinoid markers fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) and cannabinoid CB1 receptors and the cell proliferation marker Ki-67 were available in the database. For the cases followed by expectancy, the prognostic value of endoglin was dependent upon the tumour epithelial FAAH immunoreactivity (FAAH-IR) and CB1IR scores, and the non-malignant epithelial FAAH-IR scores, but not the non-malignant CB1IR scores or the tumour blood vessel FAAH-IR scores. This dependency upon the tumour epithelial FAAH-IR or CB1IR scores was less apparent for vWf, and was not seen for Ki-67. Using an endoglin cut-off value of 10 positively stained vessels per core and a median split of tumour FAAH-IR, four groups could be generated, with 15year of disease-specific survival (%) of 68±7 (low endoglin, low FAAH), 45±11 (high endoglin, low FAAH), 77±6 (low endoglin, high FAAH) and 21±10 (high endoglin, high FAAH). Thus, the cases with high endoglin and high FAAH scores have the poorest rate of disease-specific survival. At diagnosis, the number of cases with tumour stages 1a-1b relative to stages 2-4 was sensitive to the endoglin score in a manner dependent upon the tumour FAAH-IR. It is concluded that the prognostic value of endoglin as a marker of neovascularisation in prostate cancer can be influenced by the expression level of markers of the endocannabinoid system.

In this study, we proposed an efficient approach, called ellipsoidFN (ellipsoid Feature Net), to model the disease complexity by ellipsoids and seek a set of heterogeneous biomarkers. Our approach achieves a non-linear classification scheme for the mixed samples by the ellipsoid concept, and at the same time uses a linear programming framework to efficiently select biomarkers from high-dimensional space. ellipsoidFN reduces the redundancy and improves the complementariness between the identified biomarkers, thus significantly enhancing the distinctiveness between cancers and normal samples, and even between cancer types. Numerical evaluation on real prostate cancer, breast cancer and leukemia gene expression datasets suggested that ellipsoidFN outperforms the state-of-the-art biomarker identification methods, and it can serve as a useful tool for cancer biomarker identification in the future.

Many anti-cancer drugs and chemicals induce NAG-1 expression, but the mechanisms are not fully understood. Transgenic mice expressing human NAG-1 are resistant to intestinal and prostate cancer, suggesting that NAG-1 is a tumor suppressor. Proteasome inhibitors exhibit anti-glioblastoma activities in preclinical studies. Here, we show that the proteasome inhibitors MG132 and bortezomib induced NAG-1 expression and secretion in glioblastoma cells. MG132 increased NAG-1 expression through transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. At the transcriptional level, the induction of NAG-1 required the -133 to +41 bp region of the promoter. At post-transcriptional levels, MG132 stabilized NAG-1 mRNA by increasing the half-life from 1.5 h to >8 h. Because of the dramatic increase in mRNA stability, this is likely the major contributor to MG132-mediated NAG-1 induction. Further probing into the mechanism revealed that MG132 increased phosphorylation of the p38 MAPK pathway. Consequently, inhibiting p38 phosphorylation blocked activation of the NAG-1 promoter and decreased mRNA stability, indicating that p38 MAPK activation mediates both MG132-dependent promoter activation and mRNA stabilization of NAG-1.

The median time to progression (TTP) from chemotherapy initiation is 6 to 8 months. Ketoconazole, a nonspecific cytochrome P17 inhibitor (CYP17i), blocks adrenal androgen synthesis. Low-dose ketoconazole (LDK), (200 mg three times daily [t.d.s]) has shown activity in mCRPC after progression to androgen deprivation. The role of a CYP17i after docetaxel treatment in the maintenance setting has been unexplored.  Methods:   We identified 38 patients with mCRPC who showed progression to luteinizing hormone releasing-hormone agonists (LHRHa) and who were treated with a median of 7 cycles of frontline three-weekly docetaxel (75 mg/m(2)) plus prednisone (10 mg/d) and LHRHa. Medical charts of 20 patients who showed no progression to docetaxel were reviewed. After the last docetaxel cycle, 10 patients received LDK maintenance treatment plus prednisone (10 mg/d) and LHRHa, whereas 10 patients received LHRHa alone. TTP was the primary endpoint.  Results:   After a follow-up of 27 months, disease in all patients receiving LHRHa alone progressed, whereas 8/10 patients progressed to maintenance therapy. Median TTP from docetaxel initiation was 11.5 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 6.3-16.6) for maintenance therapy and 9.2 months (95% CI, 8.5-9.9) for LHRHa alone (P = .047). The maintenance treatment was well tolerated. Only 1 patient experienced a grade 4 adverse event due to a nonsymptomatic pulmonary embolism.  Conclusion:   This is the first study evaluating a CYP17i for maintenance therapy after docetaxel therapy. We showed a 2-month significant benefit in TTP for patients with mCRPC treated with LDK maintenance therapy after docetaxel, with a favorable toxicity profile.

Results:   Although one SNP (rs8082134, P < 0.050) was significant, it is very rare and unstable. Other SNPs had no significant difference between genotype distributions in the PCa patients and the control group. Totally, SNPs in the MPO gene is not associated with PCa risk.  Conclusion:   Our data showed a limited association between the MPO SNPs and the susceptibility to PCa in population of Chinese Han population.

Patients and methods:   One hundred sixty-five patients who received RP for clinically localized PCa were enrolled. Serum levels of interleukin (IL)-10, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, IL-1β, IL-8, and IL-12p70 were quantitatively measured using a multiplex bead array at three time points (i.e., before the operation [pre-OP], immediately after the operation [post-OP], and on postoperative Day 1 [POD1]). The perioperative changes in serum stress markers, including cytokines, were compared between patients who underwent open and laparoscopic RP, and the predictors for high levels of postoperative cytokines were assessed.  Results:   The median age and estimated blood loss were significantly lower in the laparoscopic RP group than in the open RP group (P=.003 and P<.01, respectively). In all patients, body temperature, white blood cell count, and serum IL-10 and IL-6 levels were significantly higher at post-OP and POD1 than at pre-OP.

In this study, we sought to test a panel of cancer-specific markers in urine samples as an aid for early cancer diagnosis.  Materials and methods:   Sedimented urine samples of 66 candidates for needle biopsy were tested. Real time-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was applied to detect the expression of transmembrane protease serine-2 and Ets-related gene fusion (TMPRSS2-ERG), Ets-related gene (ERG), prostate cancer antigen-3 (PCA3), and serine peptidase inhibitor kazal type-1 (SPINK1) transcripts. For testing of the methylation status of Glutahione S-tranferase P (GSTP1) and Ras association domain family member-1(RASSF1A) promoter region, methylation-specific PCR (MSP-PCR) was applied.  Results:   Among the tested parameters, the presence of TMPRSS2-ERG (OR=9.044, 95% CI=2.207-37.066, p=0.002), as well as a positive test result for PCA3 (OR=7.549, 95% CI=1,858-30,672, p=0.005) were associated with the subsequent diagnosis of prostate cancer. A multivariable logistic regression including all the significantly associated variables [prostate-specific antigen (PSA), digital rectal examination (DRE), TMPRSS2-ERG and PCA3], yielded a model with area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) =0.894 (95% CI=0.772-1.00).

The ghrelin gene locus (GHRL) is highly complex and gives rise to a range of novel transcripts derived from alternative first exons and internally spliced exons. The wild-type transcript encodes a 117 amino acid preprohormone that is processed to yield the 28 amino acid peptide ghrelin. Here, we identified insulin-responsive transcription corresponding to cryptic exons in intron 2 of the human ghrelin gene. A transcript, termed in2c-ghrelin (intron 2-cryptic), was cloned from the testis and the LNCaP prostate cancer cell line. This transcript may encode an 83 amino acid preproghrelin isoform that codes for ghrelin, but not obestatin. It is expressed in a limited number of normal tissues and in tumours of the prostate, testis, breast and ovary. Finally, we confirmed that in2c-ghrelin transcript expression, as well as the recently described in1-ghrelin transcript, is significantly upregulated by insulin in cultured prostate cancer cells. Metabolic syndrome and hyperinsulinaemia have been associated with prostate cancer risk and progression. This may be particularly significant after androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer, which induces hyperinsulinaemia, and this could contribute to castrate-resistant prostate cancer growth. We have previously demonstrated that ghrelin stimulates prostate cancer cell line proliferation in vitro.

We examined possible differences in PCa risk by clinical risk category between native-born and immigrant populations in Sweden. Our hypothesis was that lower PSA-testing uptake among foreign-born men would result in lower rates of localized disease, and similar or higher risk of metastatic disease.  Methods:   Using the Prostate Cancer database Sweden, we identified 117,328 men with PCa diagnosed from 1991 to 2008, of which 8,332 were foreign born. For each case, 5 cancer-free matched controls were randomly selected from the population register. Conditional logistic regression was used to compare low risk, intermediate risk, high risk, regionally metastatic, and distant metastatic PCa based upon region of origin.  Results:   Across all risk categories, immigrants had significantly lower PCa risk than native-born Swedish men, except North Americans and Northern Europeans. The lowest PCa risk was observed in men from the Middle East, Southern Europe, and Asia. Multivariable adjustment for socioeconomic factors and comorbidities did not materially change risk estimates. Older age at immigration and more recent arrival in Sweden were associated with lower PCa risk. Non-native men were less likely to be diagnosed with PCa through PSA testing during a health checkup.  Conclusions:   The risk for all stages of PCa was lower among first-generation immigrants to Sweden compared with native-born men. Older age at immigration and more recent immigration were associated with particularly low risks. Patterns of PSA testing appeared to only partly explain the differences in PCa risk, since immigrant men also had a lower risk of metastatic disease.""","""['Stacy Loeb', 'Linda Drevin', 'David Robinson', 'Erik Holmberg', 'Sigrid Carlsson', 'Mats Lambe', 'Pär Stattin']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Cancer Causes Control""","""['Risk of prostate cancer among Swedish-born and foreign-born men in Sweden, 1961-2004.', 'Mortality in first- and second-generation immigrants to Sweden diagnosed with type 2 diabetes: a 10\xa0year nationwide cohort study.', 'Prostate cancer incidence and survival in immigrants to Sweden.', 'Evidence of cancer progression as the cause of death in men with prostate cancer in Sweden.', 'Epidemiology and Prevention of Prostate Cancer.', 'Marital status and prostate cancer incidence: a pooled analysis of 12 case-control studies from the PRACTICAL consortium.', 'The Value of Real-World Data in Understanding Prostate Cancer Risk and Improving Clinical Care: Examples from Swedish Registries.', 'The incidence, mortality, and risk factors of prostate cancer in Asian men.', 'Cancer and the healthy immigrant effect: a statistical analysis of cancer diagnosis using a linked Census-cancer registry administrative database.', 'Health inequalities among workers with a foreign background in Sweden: do working conditions matter?']"""

The impact of variants on a 3-dimensional structure of GCPII was explored by in silico studies. Six novel variations i.e. V108A, P160S, Y176H, D191V, G206R and G245S; and two known variations i.e. R190W and H475Y were identified in GCPII.

Haplotypes with V108A and G245S variants showed increased risk for prostate cancer due to high PSMA expression while P160S conferred protection against prostate cancer. In silico studies suggests that P160S and R190W variants result in relaxed substrate binding facilitating either rapid catalysis or exchange of substrates and products in the active site which was substantiated by high plasma folate levels associated with these variants. On the contrary, D191V was associated with very low plasma folate levels despite having a high PSMA expression.

AhR mediates the biochemical and toxic effects of a number of polyaromatic hydrocarbons such as 2,3,7,8,-tetrachloro-dibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). AhR is widely known for regulating the transcription of drug metabolizing enzymes involved in the xenobiotic metabolism of carcinogens and therapeutic agents, such as cytochrome P450-1B1 (CYP1B1). Additionally, AhR has also been reported to interact with multiple signaling pathways during prostate development. Here we investigate the effect of sustained AhR signaling on androgen receptor function in prostate cancer cells. Immunoblot analysis shows that AhR expression is increased in androgen independent (C4-2) prostate cancer cells when compared to androgen sensitive (LNCaP) cells. RT-PCR studies revealed constitutive AhR signaling in C4-2 cells without the ligand induced activation required in LNCaP cells. A reduction of AhR activity by short RNA mediated silencing in C4-2 cells reduced expression of both AhR and androgen responsive genes. The decrease in androgen responsive genes correlates to a decrease in phosphorylated androgen receptor and androgen receptor expression in the nucleus.

These data indicates that AhR is required to maintain hormone independent signaling and growth by the androgen receptor in C4-2 cells.

Methods:   Cross-sectional analysis of the 1999 and 2009 National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and the outpatient department component of the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, which are nationally representative annual surveys of visits to non-federally funded ambulatory care practices. We applied 22 quality indicators using a combination of current quality measures and guideline recommendations. The main outcome measures were the rates of underuse, overuse, and misuse and their 95% CIs.  Results:   We observed a statistically significant improvement in 6 of 9 underuse quality indicators. There was an improvement in the use of antithrombotic therapy for atrial fibrillation; the use of aspirin, β-blockers, and statins in coronary artery disease; the use of β-blockers in congestive heart failure; and the use of statins in diabetes mellitus. We observed an improvement in only 2 of 11 overuse quality indicators, 1 indicator became worse, and 8 did not change. There was a statistically significant decrease in the overuse of cervical cancer screening in visits for women older than 65 years and in the overuse of antibiotics in asthma exacerbations. However, there was an increase in the overuse of prostate cancer screening in men older than 74 years. Of the 2 misuse indicators, there was a decrease in the proportion of patients with a urinary tract infection who were prescribed an inappropriate antibiotic.  Conclusions:   We found significant improvement in the delivery of underused care but more limited changes in the reduction of inappropriate care.

The prospective discrimination of aggressive and clinically insignificant tumors still poses a significant and, as yet, unsolved problem. PITX2 DNA methylation is a strong prognostic biomarker in prostate cancer. Recently, a diagnostic microarray for prostate cancer prognosis based on PITX2 methylation has been developed and validated. Because this microarray requires nonstandard laboratory equipment, its use in a diagnostic setting is limited. This study aimed to develop and validate an alternative quantitative real-time PCR assay for measuring PITX2 methylation that can easily be established in clinical laboratories, thereby facilitating the implementation of this biomarker in clinical practice. A methylation cut-off for patient stratification was established in a training cohort (n = 157) and validated in an independent test set (n = 523) of men treated with radical prostatectomy. In univariate Cox proportional hazards analysis, PITX2 hypermethylation was a significant predictor for biochemical recurrence (P < 0.001, hazard ratio = 2.614). Moreover, PITX2 hypermethylation added significant prognostic information (P = 0.003, hazard ratio = 1.814) to the Gleason score, pathological T stage, prostate-specific antigen, and surgical margins in a multivariate analysis. The clinical performance was particularly high in patients at intermediate risk (Gleason score of 7) and in samples containing high tumor cell content.

We assembled the most recent cancer registry data to estimate the burden of the 17 most common cancers in the region, from Slovenia to Cyprus and Malta.  Methods:   Data were made available for analysis from Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Malta, Romania (Cluj County), Serbia, Slovenia and Turkey (Antalya and Izmir provinces). We analysed incidence and mortality of the 17 most common cancers (counts and age-standardised rates, for the most recent year available and for the period 1999-2008). We used Joinpoint regression to quantify recent trends.  Findings:   For much of SE Europe, there were no marked declines in overall cancer mortality rates during 1999-2008. In men, lung cancer incidence and mortality rates were high compared to other European countries (age-standardised rates (ASRW) of incidence being 50-60/100,000 in most of the countries), and still increasing in Bulgaria, Serbia and Turkey. Prostate cancer incidence rapidly increased throughout the region by 3-12% annually, largely without any clear declines in mortality. Colorectal cancer incidence increased throughout the region, as did mortality especially in Croatia, Serbia and Bulgaria (average annual percentage change (AAPC) 1.5-2%). In women, breast cancer mortality significantly declined in Slovenia, Croatia and Malta (Average Annual Percentage of Change [AAPC] -2%, -1% and -5%, respectively), but not elsewhere. Cervical cancer incidence rates remained very high in Romania, Serbia and Bulgaria (ASRW>20/100,000).

The behavior of such facilities is likely to change under the Affordable Care Act. We modeled how accountable care reform may affect the financial standing of PBT centers and their incentives to treat complex patient cases.  Methods and materials:   We used operational data and publicly listed Medicare rates to model the relationship between financial metrics for PBT center performance and case mix (defined as the percentage of complex cases, such as pediatric central nervous system tumors). Financial metrics included total daily revenues and debt coverage (daily revenues - daily debt payments). Fee-for-service (FFS) and accountable care (ACO) reimbursement scenarios were modeled. Sensitivity analyses were performed around the room time required to treat noncomplex cases: simple (30 minutes), prostate (24 minutes), and short prostate (15 minutes). Sensitivity analyses were also performed for total machine operating time (14, 16, and 18 h/d).  Results:   Reimbursement under ACOs could reduce daily revenues in PBT centers by up to 32%. The incremental revenue gained by replacing 1 complex case with noncomplex cases was lowest for simple cases and highest for short prostate cases. ACO rates reduced this incremental incentive by 53.2% for simple cases and 41.7% for short prostate cases. To cover daily debt payments after ACO rates were imposed, 26% fewer complex patients were allowable at varying capital costs and interest rates. Only facilities with total machine operating times of 18 hours per day would cover debt payments in all scenarios.  Conclusions:   Debt-financed PBT centers will face steep challenges to remain financially viable after ACO implementation. Paradoxically, reduced reimbursement for noncomplex cases will require PBT centers to treat more such cases over cases for which PBT has demonstrated superior outcomes. Relative losses will be highest for those facilities focused primarily on treating noncomplex cases.""","""['Shereef M Elnahal', 'John Kerstiens', 'Richard S Helsper', 'Anthony L Zietman', 'Peter A S Johnstone']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Proton beam therapy and accountable care: the challenges ahead: in regard to Elnahal et al.', 'Proton facility economics: the importance of ""simple"" treatments.', 'Proton beam therapy and accountable care: the challenges ahead: in regard to Elnahal et al.', 'Proton therapy expansion under current United States reimbursement models.', 'Transforming healthcare delivery: Why and how accountable care organizations must evolve.', 'The Bundled Payments for Care Improvement Initiative.', 'Operational Performance of a Compact Proton Therapy System: A 5-Year Experience.', 'PTCOG Head and Neck Subcommittee Consensus Guidelines on Particle Therapy for the Management of Head and Neck Tumors.', 'Early Experience of the First Single-Room Gantry Mounted Active Scanning Proton Therapy System at an Integrated Cancer Center.', 'Proton versus photon-based radiation therapy for prostate cancer: emerging evidence and considerations in the era of value-based cancer care.', 'Clinical evidence of variable proton biological effectiveness in pediatric patients treated for ependymoma.']"""

Long-term ADT decreases bone mineral density (BMD) and increases the risk of osteoporosis. The objective of this clinical trial was to evaluate the efficacy of risedronate for the prevention of BMD loss in nonmetastatic prostate cancer patients undergoing RT plus 2 to 3 years of ADT.  Methods and materials:   A double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized trial was conducted for nonmetastatic prostate cancer patients receiving RT plus 2 to 3 years of ADT. All had T scores > -2.5 on dual energy x-ray absorptiometry at baseline. Patients were randomized 1:1 between risedronate and placebo for 2 years. The primary endpoints were the percent changes in the BMD of the lumbar spine at 1 and 2 years from baseline, measured by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry. Analyses of the changes in BMD and bone turnover biomarkers were carried out by comparing mean values of the intrapatient changes between the 2 arms, using standard t tests.  Results:   One hundred four patients were accrued between 2004 and 2007, with 52 in each arm. Mean age was 66.8 and 67.5 years for the placebo and risedronate, respectively. At 1 and 2 years, mean (±SE) BMD of the lumbar spine decreased by 5.77% ± 4.66% and 13.55% ± 6.33%, respectively, in the placebo, compared with 0.12% ± 1.29% at 1 year (P=.2485) and 0.85% ± 1.56% (P=.0583) at 2 years in the risedronate. The placebo had a significant increase in serum bone turnover biomarkers compared with the risedronate.

Methods and materials:   Rectal toxicity was analyzed in 718 men previously treated for prostate cancer with EBRT (≥75 Gy). Comorbid illness was scored using the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCMI), and the NTCP was evaluated with the QUANTEC model. The influence of clinical and treatment-related parameters on rectal toxicity was assessed by Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards models.  Results:   The cumulative incidence of rectal toxicity grade ≥2 was 9.5% and 11.6% at 3 and 5 years and 3.3% and 3.9% at 3 and 5 years for grade ≥3 toxicity, respectively. Each year of age predicted an increasing relative risk of grade ≥2 (P<.03; hazard ratio [HR], 1.04 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 1.01-1.06]) and ≥3 rectal toxicity (P<.0001; HR, 1.14 [95% CI,1.07-1.22]). Increasing CCMI predicted rectal toxicity where a history of either myocardial infarction (MI) (P<.0001; HR, 5.1 [95% CI, 1.9-13.7]) or congestive heart failure (CHF) (P<.0006; HR, 5.4 [95% CI, 0.6-47.5]) predicted grade ≥3 rectal toxicity, with lesser correlation with grade ≥2 toxicity (P<.02 for MI, and P<.09 for CHF). An age comorbidity model to predict rectal toxicity was developed and confirmed in a validation cohort. The use of anticoagulants increased toxicity independent of age and comorbidity. NTCP was prognostic for grade ≥3 (P=.015) but not grade ≥2 (P=.49) toxicity. On multivariate analysis, age, MI, CHF, and an NTCP >20% all correlated with late rectal toxicity.

Objective:   This study aims to quantify the long-term HRQoL impact associated with screening for PCa.  Design, setting, and participants:   Postal questionnaire surveys were conducted in 1998, 2000, 2004, and 2011 among men in the Finnish PCa screening trial diagnosed with PCa (total n=7011) and among a random subsample of the trial population (n=2200). In 2011, for example, 1587 responses were received from men with PCa in the screening arm and 1706 from men in the control arm. In addition, from the trial subsample, 549 men in the screening arm and 539 in the control arm provided responses.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Health-state-value scores were compared between the intervention and control arms using three distinct HRQoL measures (15D, EQ-5D, and SF-6D), and statistical significance was assessed using t tests. In addition, differences over repeated assessments of HRQoL between groups were evaluated using generalised estimating equations.  Results and limitations:   In the 2011 survey, a small but statistically significant difference emerged between the trial arms among men diagnosed with PCa (mean scores, screening vs control arm: 15D: 0.872 vs 0.866, p=0.14; EQ-5D: 0.852 vs 0.831, p=0.03; and SF-6D: 0.763 vs 0.756, p=0.06). Such differences in favour of the screening arm were not found among the sample of men from the trial (15D: 0.889 vs 0.892, p=0.62; EQ-5D: 0.831 vs 0.852, p=0.08; and SF-6D: 0.775 vs 0.777, p=0.88). The slight advantage with screening among men with PCa was reasonably consistent across time in the longitudinal analysis and was strongest among men with early-stage disease.

PCa is strongly age associated; low death rates in surveillance cohorts call into question the widespread use of surgery, which leads to overtreatment and a reduction in quality of life. There is a great need to increase the understanding of tumor characteristics in the context of disease progression.  Objective:   To perform the first multigenome investigation of PCa through analysis of both autosomal and mitochondrial DNA, and to integrate exome sequencing data, and RNA sequencing and copy-number alteration (CNA) data to investigate how various different tumor characteristics, commonly analyzed separately, are interconnected.  Design, setting, and participants:   Exome sequencing was applied to 64 tumor samples from 55 PCa patients with varying stage and grade. Integrated analysis was performed on a core set of 50 tumors from which exome sequencing, CNA, and RNA sequencing data were available.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Genes, mutated at a significantly higher rate relative to a genomic background, were identified. In addition, mitochondrial and autosomal mutation rates were correlated to CNAs and proliferation, assessed as a cell cycle gene expression signature.  Results and limitations:   Genes not previously reported to be significantly mutated in PCa, such as cell division cycle 27 homolog (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) (CDC27), myeloid/lymphoid or mixed-lineage leukemia 3 (MLL3), lysine (K)-specific demethylase 6A (KDM6A), and kinesin family member 5A (KIF5A) were identified. The mutation rate in the mitochondrial genome was 55 times higher than that of the autosomes. Multilevel analysis demonstrated a tight correlation between high reactive-oxygen exposure, chromosomal damage, high proliferation, and in parallel, a transition from multiclonal indolent primary PCa to monoclonal aggressive disease. As we only performed targeted sequence analysis; copy-number neutral rearrangements recently described for PCa were not accounted for.  Conclusions:   The mitochondrial genome displays an elevated mutation rate compared to the autosomal chromosomes.

Here we investigated the molecular mechanism(s) underlying cell death induced in prostate cancer cells by α-TOS, VK3 and AA, and the potential use of targeted drug combination in the treatment of prostate cancer.  Methodology/principal findings:   The generation of ROS, cellular response to oxidative stress, and autophagy were investigated in PC3 prostate cancer cells by using drugs at sub-toxic doses. We evaluated whether PARP1-mediated apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) release plays a role in apoptosis induced by the combination of the agents. Next, the effect of the combination of α-TOS, VK3 and AA on tumor growth was examined in nude mice. VK3 plus AA induced early ROS formation associated with induction of autophagy in response to oxidative stress, which was reduced by α-TOS, preventing the formation of autophagosomes. α-TOS induced mitochondrial destabilization leading to the release of AIF. Translocation of AIF from mitochondria to the nucleus, a result of the combinatorial treatment, was mediated by PARP1 activation. The inhibition of AIF as well as of PARP1 efficiently attenuated apoptosis triggered by the drug combination.

Activated α(2)M (α(2)M*) binds to cancer cell surface GRP78 and triggers proliferative and antiapoptotic signaling. We have studied the role of α(2)M* in the regulation of mTORC1 and TORC2 signaling in the growth of human prostate cancer cells.  Methods:   Employing immunoprecipitation techniques and Western blotting as well as kinase assays, activation of the mTORC1 and mTORC2 complexes, as well as down stream targets were studied. RNAi was also employed to silence expression of Raptor, Rictor, or GRP78 in parallel studies.  Results:   Stimulation of cells with α(2)M* promotes phosphorylation of mTOR, TSC2, S6-Kinase, 4EBP, Akt(T308), and Akt(S473) in a concentration and time-dependent manner. Rheb, Raptor, and Rictor also increased. α(2)M* treatment of cells elevated mTORC1 kinase activity as determined by kinase assays of mTOR or Raptor immunoprecipitates. mTORC1 activity was sensitive to LY294002 and rapamycin or transfection of cells with GRP78 dsRNA. Down regulation of Raptor expression by RNAi significantly reduced α(2)M*-induced S6-Kinase phosphorylation at T389 and kinase activity in Raptor immunoprecipitates. α(2)M*-treated cells demonstrate about a twofold increase in mTORC2 kinase activity as determined by kinase assay of Akt(S473) phosphorylation and levels of p-Akt(S473) in mTOR and Rictor immunoprecipitates. mTORC2 activity was sensitive to LY294002 and transfection of cells with GRP78 dsRNA, but insensitive to rapamycin. Down regulation of Rictor expression by RNAi significantly reduces α(2)M*-induced phosphorylation of Akt(S473) phosphorylation in Rictor immunoprecipitates.

Resveratrol inhibits cancer by reducing cell proliferation and metastasis and by inducing apoptosis. These actions could be explained by its ability to inhibit (ERK-1/2), Akt and suppressing the levels of estrogen and insulin growth factor -1 (IGF-1) receptor. How these processes are manifested into the antitumor actions of resveratrol is not clear. Using microarray studies, we show that resveratrol reduced the expression of various prostate-tumor associated microRNAs (miRs) including miR-21 in androgen-receptor negative and highly aggressive human prostate cancer cells, PC-3M-MM2. This effect of resveratrol was associated with reduced cell viability, migration and invasiveness. Additionally, resveratrol increased the expression of tumor suppressors, PDCD4 and maspin, which are negatively regulated by miR-21. Short interfering (si) RNA against PDCD4 attenuated resveratrol's effect on prostate cancer cells, and similar effects were observed following over expression of miR-21 with pre-miR-21 oligonucleotides. PC-3M-MM2 cells also exhibited high levels of phospho-Akt (pAkt), which were reduced by both resveratrol and LY294002 (a PI3-kinase inhibitor). MiR-21 expression in these cells appeared to be dependent on Akt, as LY294002 reduced the levels of miR-21 along with a concurrent increase in PDCD4 expression. These in vitro findings were further corroborated in a severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mouse xenograft model of prostate cancer. Oral administration of resveratrol not only inhibited the tumor growth but also decreased the incidence and number of metastatic lung lesions. These tumor- and metastatic-suppressive effects of resveratrol were associated with reduced miR-21 and pAkt, and elevated PDCD4 levels. Similar anti-tumor effects of resveratrol were observed in DU145 and LNCaP prostate cancer cells which were associated with suppression of Akt and PDCD4, but independent of miR-21.These data suggest that resveratrol's anti-tumor actions in prostate cancer could be explained, in part, through inhibition of Akt/miR-21 signaling pathway.""","""['Sandeep Sheth', 'Sarvesh Jajoo', 'Tejbeer Kaur', 'Debashree Mukherjea', 'Kelly Sheehan', 'Leonard P Rybak', 'Vickram Ramkumar']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Essential role of NADPH oxidase-dependent reactive oxygen species generation in regulating microRNA-21 expression and function in prostate cancer.', 'Resveratrol sensitizes androgen independent prostate cancer cells to death-receptor mediated apoptosis through multiple mechanisms.', 'Resveratrol induces growth arrest and apoptosis through activation of FOXO transcription factors in prostate cancer cells.', 'Resveratrol as an anti-cancer agent: A review.', 'Research Progress in Elucidating the Mechanisms Underlying Resveratrol Action on Lung Cancer.', 'Inhibition of Cancer Development by Natural Plant Polyphenols: Molecular Mechanisms.', 'Combined treatments with AZD5363, AZD8542, curcumin or resveratrol induce death of human glioblastoma cells by suppressing the PI3K/AKT and SHH signaling pathways.', 'Contribution of Non-Coding RNAs to Anticancer Effects of Dietary Polyphenols: Chlorogenic Acid, Curcumin, Epigallocatechin-3-Gallate, Genistein, Quercetin and Resveratrol.', 'Evidence for Multilevel Chemopreventive Activities of Natural Phenols from Functional Genomic Studies of Curcumin, Resveratrol, Genistein, Quercetin, and Luteolin.', 'Resveratrol suppresses serum-induced vasculogenic mimicry through impairing the EphA2/twist-VE-cadherin/AKT pathway in human prostate cancer PC-3 cells.']"""

However, whether inactivation of this checkpoint contributes directly to prostate specific cancer predisposition is still unknown. Here, we show that exposure of non-malignant prostate epithelial cells (HPr-1AR) to androgen led to activation of the ATM/ATR DNA damage response and induction of cellular senescence. Notably, knockdown of the ATM gene expression in HPr-1AR cells can promote androgen-induced TMPRSS2: ERG rearrangement, a prostate-specific chromosome translocation frequently found in prostate cancer cells. Intriguingly, unlike the non-malignant prostate epithelial cells, the ATM/ATR DNA damage checkpoint appears to be defective in prostate cancer cells, since androgen treatment only induced a partial activation of the DNA damage response. This mechanism appears to preserve androgen induced autophosphorylation of ATM and phosphorylation of H2AX, lesion processing and repair pathway yet restrain ATM/CHK1/CHK2 and p53 signaling pathway.

We estimate longer-term costs of initial management strategies and potential US health expenditure savings by increased use of conservative management for men with localized prostate cancer. Five-year total health expenditures attributed to initial management strategies for localized prostate cancer were calculated using commercial claims data from 1998 to 2006, and savings were estimated from a US population health-care expenditure model. Our analysis finds that patients receiving combinations of active treatments have the highest additional costs over conservative management at $63 500, followed by $48 550 for intensity-modulated radiation therapy, $37 500 for primary androgen deprivation therapy, and $28 600 for brachytherapy. Radical prostatectomy ($15 200) and external beam radiation therapy ($18 900) were associated with the lowest costs. The population model estimated that US health expenditures could be lowered by 1) use of initial CM over all active treatment ($2.9-3.25 billion annual savings), 2) shifting patients receiving intensity-modulated radiation therapy to CM ($680-930 million), 3) foregoing primary androgen deprivation therapy($555 million), 4) reducing the use of adjuvant androgen deprivation in addition to local therapies ($630 million), and 5) using single treatments rather than combination local treatment ($620-655 million).

This is a summary of the rationale, method, and results of active surveillance beginning in 1995 with the first prospective trial of this approach. This was a prospective, single-arm cohort study. Patients were managed with an initial expectant approach. Definitive intervention was offered to those patients with a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) doubling time of less than 3 years, Gleason score progression (to 4+3 or greater), or unequivocal clinical progression. Survival analysis and Cox proportional hazard model were applied to the data. Since November 1995, 450 patients have been managed with active surveillance. The cohort included men under 70 with favorable-risk disease and men of age more than 70 with favorable- or intermediate-risk cancer (Gleason score 3+4 or PSA 10-15). Median follow-up is 6.8 years (range 1-16 years). Overall survival is 78.6%. Ten-year prostate cancer actuarial survival is 97.2%. Five of 450 patients (1.1%) have died of prostate cancer. Thirty percent of patients have been reclassified as higher-risk patients and offered definitive therapy. The commonest indication for treatment was a PSA doubling time less than 3 years (48%) or Gleason upgrading (26%). Of 117 patients treated radically, the PSA failure rate was 50%. This represents 13% of the total cohort. Most PSA failures occurred early; at 2 years, 44% of the treated patients had PSA failure. The hazard ratio for non-prostate cancer mortality to prostate cancer mortality was 18.6 at 10 years. In conclusion, we observed a very low rate of prostate cancer mortality in an intermediate time frame. Among the one-third of patients who were reclassified as higher risk and retreated, PSA failure was relatively common. However, other-cause mortality accounted for almost all of the deaths.

The research agenda for decision aids includes evaluating content elements and format, timing and setting for delivery, the quality of the decision-making process, and the effects of decision support on treatment selection (which will occur repeatedly for men opting for active surveillance) and quality of life.""","""['Richard M Hoffman']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""J Natl Cancer Inst Monogr""","""['Presenting treatment options to men with clinically localized prostate cancer: the acceptability of active surveillance/monitoring.', 'The comparative effectiveness of decision aids in diverse populations with early stage prostate cancer: a study protocol for a cluster-randomized controlled trial in the NCI Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP), Alliance A191402CD.', 'Active surveillance compared with initial treatment for men with low-risk prostate cancer: a decision analysis.', 'Decision aids for people facing health treatment or screening decisions.', 'Clarifying uncertainty regarding detection and treatment of early-stage prostate cancer.', 'Effectiveness of Decision Aid in Men with Localized Prostate Cancer: a Multicenter Randomized Controlled Trial at Tertiary Referral Hospitals in an Asia Pacific Country.', 'Informed decision-making based on a leaflet in the context of prostate cancer screening.', 'Decision-making processes among men with low-risk prostate cancer: A survey study.', ""Physicians' perspectives on the informational needs of low-risk prostate cancer patients."", 'Perceptions of Urologists About the Conversational Elements Leading to Treatment Decision-Making Among Newly Diagnosed Prostate Cancer Patients.']"""

Active surveillance and monitoring programs are now a recognized treatment option for men with low-risk localized prostate cancer, but many patients are not fully aware of the details of such programs, and most still opt for immediate radical (surgery or radiotherapy) treatment. The provision of high-quality information with decision aids has been shown to increase the acceptability of active surveillance/monitoring programs. This chapter outlines techniques for providing high-quality information about active surveillance/monitoring, based on the findings of a randomized controlled trial of treatments for localized prostate cancer. The ProtecT (Prostate testing for cancer and Treatment) trial has randomized over 1500 men between active monitoring, radical surgery, and radical radiotherapy by ensuring that information was tailored to men's existing knowledge and views. Care was taken with the content, order, and enthusiasm of the presentation of treatments by recruitment staff, and clinicians and other health professionals were supported to feel comfortable with being open about the uncertainties in the evidence and helped to rephrase terminology likely to be misinterpreted by patients. These techniques of information provision should be added to the use of decision aids to enable patients diagnosed with clinically localized prostate cancer in routine practice to reach well-informed and reasoned decisions about their treatment, including full consideration of active surveillance and monitoring programs.""","""['Jenny L Donovan']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""J Natl Cancer Inst Monogr""","""['Active monitoring, radical prostatectomy and radical radiotherapy in PSA-detected clinically localised prostate cancer: the ProtecT three-arm RCT.', 'Improving the communication of benefits and harms of treatment strategies: decision AIDS for localized prostate cancer treatment decisions.', 'An evidence review of active surveillance in men with localized prostate cancer.', 'The Prostate Cancer Intervention Versus Observation Trial: VA/NCI/AHRQ Cooperative Studies Program #407 (PIVOT): design and baseline results of a randomized controlled trial comparing radical prostatectomy with watchful waiting for men with clinically localized prostate cancer.', 'Clarifying uncertainty regarding detection and treatment of early-stage prostate cancer.', 'Quality of Life and Psychological Distress among Patients with Small Renal Masses.', ""Cross-cultural differences in men on active surveillance' anxiety: a longitudinal comparison between Italian and Dutch patients from the Prostate cancer Research International Active Surveillance study."", 'Perceived barriers to the adoption of active surveillance in low-risk prostate cancer: a qualitative analysis of community and academic urologists.', 'The effect of the area proportion of the metastatic lesion within the central metastatic lymph node on response to therapy in papillary thyroid carcinoma.', 'Prognostic significance of baseline fatigue for overall survival: A patient-level meta-analysis of 43 oncology clinical trials with 3915 patients.']"""

In the United States, 90% of men with prostate cancer are more than age 60 years, diagnosed by early detection with the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood test, and have disease believed confined to the prostate gland (clinically localized). Common treatments for clinically localized prostate cancer include watchful waiting (WW), surgery to remove the prostate gland (radical prostatectomy), external-beam radiation therapy and interstitial radiation therapy (brachytherapy), and androgen deprivation. Little is known about the relative effectiveness and harms of treatments because of the paucity of randomized controlled trials. The Department of Veterans Affairs/National Cancer Institute/Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Cooperative Studies Program Study #407:Prostate Cancer Intervention Versus Observation Trial (PIVOT), initiated in 1994, is a multicenter randomized controlled trial comparing radical prostatectomy with WW in men with clinically localized prostate cancer. We describe the study rationale, design, recruitment methods, and baseline characteristics of PIVOT enrollees. We provide comparisons with eligible men declining enrollment and men participating in another recently reported randomized trial of radical prostatectomy vs WW conducted in Scandinavia. We screened 13 022 men with prostate cancer at 52 US medical centers for potential enrollment. From these, 5023 met initial age, comorbidity, and disease eligibility criteria, and a total of 731 men agreed to participate and were randomized. The mean age of enrollees was 67 years. Nearly one-third were African American. Approximately 85% reported that they were fully active. The median PSA was 7.8ng/mL (mean 10.2ng/mL). In three-fourths of men, the primary reason for biopsy leading to a diagnosis of prostate cancer was a PSA elevation or rise. Using previously developed tumor risk categorizations incorporating PSA levels, Gleason histologic grade, and tumor stage, it was found that approximately 40% had low-risk, 34% had medium-risk, and 21% had high-risk prostate cancer based on local histopathology. Comparison to our national sample of eligible men declining PIVOT participation as well as to men enrolled in the Scandinavian trial indicated that PIVOT enrollees are representative of men being diagnosed and treated in the United States and quite different from men in the Scandinavian trial. PIVOT enrolled an ethnically diverse population representative of men diagnosed with prostate cancer in the United States.

The most powerful predictor of long-term outcome is the Gleason score, followed by tumor volume. Over the past two decades, changes in the interpretation of Gleason patterns have resulted in the reclassification of many well-differentiated tumors as higher grade tumors. Men with well-differentiated disease have an excellent prognosis and often survive 10-20 years without intervention.

It is important to understand these changes to develop appropriate treatment options for contemporarily diagnosed prostate cancer. We explored a group of four temporal changes in prostate cancer detection that occurred after the advent of PSA testing. Through changes in the use of PSA testing, performance of prostate biopsy, application of PSA testing in different age groups, and pathologic tumor grading, a significant increase in detection of potentially inconsequential prostate cancers has occurred.

The effect of screening on prostate cancer mortality is less certain. Screening has caused a dramatic increase in the number and proportion of men diagnosed with localized disease.

Factors promoting the overdiagnosis of prostate cancer are reviewed. First is the existence of a relatively large, silent reservoir of this disease, as can be seen by evaluating autopsy studies and histologic step-sectioning results of prostates removed for other causes. The second main factor responsible for prostate cancer overdiagnosis is fairly widespread prostate-specific antigen and digital rectal examination-based screening, which has been fairly widely practiced in the United States for the past 20 years among heterogeneous groups of men. This has resulted in the identification of many men from this reservoir who otherwise may never have been diagnosed with symptomatic prostate cancer and is substantially responsible for the current annual incidence to mortality ratio for prostate cancer of approximately 6 to 1. Finally, the relatively indolent natural history and limited cancer-specific mortality as reported in a variety of contemporary randomized screening and treatment trials is reviewed. We attempt to quantitate the proportion of newly diagnosed prostate cancers that are overdiagnosed using various trial results and models. We explore the impact of prostate cancer overdiagnosis in terms of patient anxiety and the potential for overtreatment, with its attendant morbidity. We explore strategies to minimize overdiagnosis by targeting screening and biopsy only to men at high risk for aggressive prostate cancer and by considering the use of agents such as 5-alpha reductase inhibitors.

Cells in suspension flowing through an orifice in a barrier inserted into the electrophoresis apparatus were exposed to defined localized dcEFs in the range of 0-1000 V/cm for a selected duration in the range 10-1000 ms. This method permitted the determination of the viability of irreversibly electroperforated cells. It also showed that the uptake by reversibly electroperforated cells of fluorescent dyes (calcein, carboxyfluorescein, Alexa Fluor 488 Phalloidin), which otherwise do not penetrate cell membranes, was dependent upon the dcEF strength and duration in any given single electrical field exposure. The method yields reproducible results, makes it easy to load large volumes of cell suspensions with membrane non-penetrating substances, and permits the elimination of irreversibly electroporated cells of diameter greater than desired. The results concur with and elaborate on those in earlier reports on cell electroporation in commercially available electroporators. They proved once more that the observed cell perforation does not depend upon the thermal effects of the electric current upon cells. In addition, the method eliminates many of the limitations of commercial electroporators and disposable electroporation chambers. It permits the optimization of conditions in which reversible and irreversible electroporation are separated. Over 90% of reversibly electroporated cells remain viable after one short (less than 400 ms) exposure to the localized dcEF. Experiments were conducted with the AT-2 cancer prostate cell line, human skin fibroblasts and human red blood cells, but they could be run with suspensions of any cell type.

Methods:   We examined the relation between both current and lifetime alcohol intake and prostate cancer risk in a population-based case-control study in Alberta, Canada with 947 cases with stage T2 and higher prostate cancer diagnosed between 1997 and 2000 and frequency matched to 1,039 controls, identified through random digit dialing.

In-person interviews were completed on current and lifetime history of alcohol consumption and all other prostate cancer risk factors.  Results:   Current alcohol intake did not increase prostate cancer risk but lifetime intake increased risk for both non-aggressive and aggressive cases, with an odds ratio of 1.78 (95 % CI 1.19-2.66) and 2.00 (95 % CI 1.19-3.36), respectively, for the highest intake quartile compared to non-drinkers with evidence for a linear trend.

In felines similarly to the situation reported in humans, a C-region encoding two open reading frames is spliced to a J-region gene. In contrast to humans, the feline J-region gene was found to be a pseudogene containing a deletion within its recombination signal sequence. Our findings demonstrated that the feline TARP ortholog is transcribed in the prostate gland and mammary tumors but not normal mammary tissues as is the case with human TARP.""","""['Alexander Th A Weiss', 'Marie-Charlotte von Deetzen', 'Werner Hecht', 'Manfred Reinacher', 'Achim D Gruber']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""J Vet Sci""","""['TARP as antigen in cancer immunotherapy.', 'TARP: a nuclear protein expressed in prostate and breast cancer cells derived from an alternate reading frame of the T cell receptor gamma chain locus.', 'Characterization of the androgen-regulated prostate-specific T cell receptor gamma-chain alternate reading frame protein (TARP) promoter.', 'T cells engineered with a T cell receptor against the prostate antigen TARP specifically kill HLA-A2+ prostate and breast cancer cells.', 'Morphogenic and tumorigenic potentials of the mammary growth hormone/growth hormone receptor system.', 'ACVIM consensus statement guidelines on diagnosing and distinguishing low-grade neoplastic from inflammatory lymphocytic chronic enteropathies in cats.', 'TARP as antigen in cancer immunotherapy.']"""

We carried out the uptake of [3H]-tyrosine to assess the functional activity of LAT1. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis is carried out to confirm the molecular expression of LAT1. [3H]-tyrosine uptake is found to be time dependent and linear up to 60 min. The uptake process does not exhibit any dependence on sodium ions, pH and energy. However, it is temperature dependent and found maximal at physiological temperature. The uptake of [3H]-tyrosine demonstrates saturable kinetics with K(m) and V(max) values of 34 ± 3 μM and 0.70 ± 0.02 nanomoles/min/mg protein, respectively. It is strongly inhibited by large neutral (phenylalanine, tryptophan, leucine, isoleucine) and small neutral (alanine, serine, cysteine) but not by basic (lysine and arginine) and acidic (aspartic and glutamic acid) amino acids. Isoleucine-quinidine (Ile-quinidine) prodrug generates a significant inhibitory effect on [3H]-tyrosine uptake suggesting that it is recognized by LAT1. RT-PCR analysis provided a product band at 658 and 840 bp, specific to LAT1 and LAT2, respectively. For the first time, this study demonstrates that LAT1, primarily responsible for the uptake of large neutral amino acids, is functionally active in PC-3 cells. Significant increase in the uptake generated by Ile-quinidine relative to quinidine suggests that LAT1 can be utilized for enhancing the cellular permeation of poor cell permeable anticancer drugs. Furthermore, this cell line can be utilized as an excellent in vitro model for studying the interaction of large neutral amino acid conjugated drugs with LAT1 transporter.""","""['Mitesh Patel', 'Pranjali Dalvi', 'Mitan Gokulgandhi', 'Susamita Kesh', 'Tanvi Kohli', 'Dhananjay Pal', 'Ashim K Mitra']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Int J Pharm""","""['Letter to the editor.', 'Functional characterization and molecular expression of large neutral amino acid transporter (LAT1) in human prostate cancer cells Int.

To improve the selectivity and therapeutic efficacy of such therapies, we developed a minimally invasive procedure based on a novel polymeric photosensitizer prodrug sensitive to urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA). The compound is inactive in its prodrug form and accumulates passively at the tumor site by the enhanced permeability and retention effect. There, the prodrug is selectively converted to its photoactive form by uPA, which is overexpressed by prostate cancer cells. Irradiation of the activated photosensitizer exerts a tumor-selective phototoxic effect. The prodrug alone (8 μmol/L) showed no toxic effect on PC-3 cells, but upon irradiation the cell viability was reduced by 90%. In vivo, after systemic administration of the prodrug, PC-3 xenografts became selectively fluorescent. This is indicative of the prodrug accumulation in the tumor and selective local enzymatic activation. Qualitative analysis of the activated compound confirmed that the enzymatic cleavage occurred selectively in the tumor, with only trace amounts in the neighboring skin or muscle. Subsequent photodynamic therapy studies showed complete tumor eradication of animals treated with light (150 J/cm(2) at 665 nm) 16 hours after the injection of the prodrug (7.5 mg/kg).

In this study, we evaluated a data set comprising almost 13,000 prostate biopsies that were prospectively tested for specimen provenance errors as part of routine clinical practice. The frequency of occult type 1 errors (a complete transposition between patients) and type 2 errors (contamination of the patient's tissue with 1 or more unrelated patients) was 0.26% and 0.67%, respectively; every urology practice setting and surgical pathology laboratory type with a representative sample size experienced at least 1 type 1 and 1 type 2 error during the study period.

AR is re-activated through multiple mechanisms including expression of constitutively active splice variants that lack hormone binding domains (HBDs). This highlights the need to develop therapies that target regions other than the HBD. Because the p160 coactivators interact most strongly with the amino-terminus of AR, we examined the consequences of disrupting this interaction. We identified two overlapping SRC-1 peptides that interact with AR, but not with progesterone receptor. These peptides reduce AR and AR variant AR-V7 dependent induction of an AR responsive reporter. Using mammalian two hybrid assays, we found that the peptides interrupt the AR/SRC-1, AR/SRC-2 and AR N/C interactions, but not SRC-1/CARM-1 interactions. Consistent with the SRC-1 dependence of induced, but not repressed genes, in LNCaP cells, the peptides inhibited hormone dependent induction of endogenous target genes including PSA and TMPRSS2, but did not block AR dependent repression of UGT2B17 or inhibit vitamin D receptor activity. Simultaneous detection of SRC-1 peptides and PSA by double immunofluorescence in transfected LNCaP cells clearly demonstrated a strong reduction in PSA levels in cells expressing the peptides. The peptides also inhibited the AR dependent expression of PSA in castration resistant C4-2 cells. Moreover they inhibited androgen dependent proliferation of LNCaP cells and proliferation of C4-2 cells in androgen depleted medium without affecting AR negative PC-3 cells.

Interviews were conducted by telephone or in person.  Setting:   Outpatient clinics at two regional cancer centers.  Participants:   160 total individuals; 80 patients with newly diagnosed breast (n = 22), advanced-stage prostate (n = 19), or advanced-stage lung (n = 39) cancer, and their caregivers (n = 80).  Methodologic approach:   Twenty-seven of the 80 pairs engaged in audio recorded interviews that were conducted using a semistructured interview guide. Continuous text immersion revealed themes. Validity of qualitative analysis was achieved by member checking.  Findings:   Significant findings included three themes: (a) the decision aid helped patients and caregivers understand treatment decisions better, (b) the decision aid helped patients and caregivers to be more involved in treatment decisions, and (c) frequent contact with the study nurse was valuable.  Conclusions:   Decision making was more complex than participants expected. The decision aid helped patients and caregivers make satisfying treatment decisions and become integral in a shared treatment decision-making process.  Interpretation:   Decision aids can help patients and their caregivers make difficult treatment decisions affecting quantity and quality of life during cancer treatment. The findings provide valuable information for healthcare providers helping patients and their caregivers make treatment decisions through a shared, informed, decision-making process.

Cell-free circulating DNA levels were measured by a quantitative real-time PCR method with a set of primers targeted to amplify the consensus ALU apoptotic versus necrotic origin. Prostate cancer patients before and 3 months after diagnosis showed cell-free circulating DNA released at apoptotic and non-apoptotic cell death.

Materials and methods:   At Henri Mondor's Hospital, we performed the first RALRP in 2001 and started to perform routinely RALRP since 2006. Preoperative characteristics, perioperative parameters, functional and oncological outcomes were collected in a prospective database and studied. All parameters were tested in patients undergoing RALRP beyond the learning curve of each surgeon. The overall cohort included 792 patients.  Results:   RALRP offers interesting results in terms of hospital stay, operative time, and blood loss. The overall rate of complications was low, especially concerning the rates of anastomosis' complications. An extraprostatic extension was seen in 42.8 % of specimens. The overall rate of positive margins was 30.7 % of specimens. In our cohort, after a mean follow-up of 19 months, 8.7 % of PSA failure has been reported. The rate of continence was 77.4 % at 6 months and 96.8 % at 2 years. The rate of potency was 17 % at 3 months and 60.9 % at 2 years. The 2-year rate was 86.7 % in case of intrafascial dissection. A trifecta outcome was achieved in 44 and 53 % of men at 12 and 24 months, respectively.  Conclusions:   The extraperitoneal approach confers interesting results in terms of perioperative parameters as previously described in series using a transperitoneal approach. Functional outcomes in terms of continence and potency recovery after extraperitoneal seem equivalent to those reported after transperitoneal RALRP. Longer follow-up is warranted to confirm our favorable mid-term oncologic outcomes.""","""['Guillaume Ploussard', 'Laurent Salomon', 'Bastien Parier', 'Claude Clément Abbou', 'Alexandre de la Taille']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""World J Urol""","""['Transperitoneal versus extraperitoneal robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy: A prospective single surgeon randomized comparative study.', 'Evaluation of combined oncologic and functional outcomes after robotic-assisted laparoscopic extraperitoneal radical prostatectomy: trifecta rate of achieving continence, potency and cancer control.', 'Comparisons of the perioperative, functional, and oncologic outcomes after robot-assisted versus pure extraperitoneal laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.', 'Current status of robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy: how does it compare with other surgical approaches?', 'Retropubic, laparoscopic, and robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: a systematic review and cumulative analysis of comparative studies.', 'Extraperitoneal Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy: Indications, Technique and Outcomes.', 'Laparascopic radical prostatectomy.', 'Laparoscopic varicocelectomy: virtual reality training and learning curve.']"""

Serum levels of PSA may be influenced by genetic factors as well as other factors. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) conducted in a European population successfully identified six genetic loci that were significantly associated with PSA level. In this study, we aimed to identify common genetic variants that are associated with serum level of PSA in a Chinese population. We also evaluated the effects of those variants by creating personalized PSA cutoff values. A two-stage GWAS of PSA level was performed among men age 20-69 years and self-reported cancer-free participants that underwent routine physical examinations at several hospitals in Guangxi Province, China. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) significantly associated with PSA levels in the first stage of sample (N = 1,999) were confirmed in the second stage of sample (N = 1,496). Multivariate linear regression was used to assess the independent contribution of confirmed SNPs and known covariates, such as age, to the level of PSA. SNPs in three regions were significantly associated with levels of PSA in this two-stage GWAS, and had combined P values between 4.62 × 10(-17) and 6.45 × 10(-37). The three regions are located on 1q32.1 at SLC45A3, 10q11.23 at MSMB, and 19q13.33 at KLK3. The region 1q32.1 at SLC45A3 was identified as a novel locus. Genetic variants contributed significantly more to the variance of PSA level than known covariates such as age. Personalized cutoff values of serum PSA, calculated based on the inheritance of these associated SNPs, differ considerably among individuals. Identification of these genetic markers provides new insight into the molecular mechanisms of PSA. Taking individual variation into account, these genetic variants may improve the performance of PSA to predict prostate cancer.""","""['Jielin Sun', 'Sha Tao', 'Yong Gao', 'Tao Peng', 'Aihua Tan', 'Haiying Zhang', 'Xiaobo Yang', 'Xue Qin', 'Yanling Hu', 'Junjie Feng', 'Seong-Tae Kim', 'Xiaoling Lin', 'Yongming Wu', 'Ju Zhang', 'Zhixian Li', 'Li Li', 'Linjian Mo', 'Zhengjia Liang', 'Deyi Shi', 'Zhang Huang', 'Xianghua Huang', 'Ming Liu', 'Qian Liu', 'Shijun Zhang', 'S Lilly Zheng', 'Jianfeng Xu', 'Zengnan Mo']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Hum Genet""","""['Genome-wide association study of serum prostate-specific antigen levels based on 1000 Genomes imputed data in Japanese: the Japan Multi-Institutional Collaborative Cohort Study.', 'Genetic variants at 1q32.1, 10q11.2 and 19q13.41 are associated with prostate-specific antigen for prostate cancer screening in two Korean population-based cohort studies.', 'Search for genetic factor association with cancer-free prostate-specific antigen level elevation on the basis of a genome-wide association study in the Korean population.', 'East meets West: ethnic differences in prostate cancer epidemiology between East Asians and Caucasians.', 'Polygenic risk score for genetic evaluation of prostate cancer risk in Asian populations: A narrative review.', 'A Germline Variant at 8q24 Contributes to the Serum p2PSA Level in a Chinese Prostate Biopsy Cohort.', 'Genetic polymorphisms at 19q13.33 are associated with -2proPSA (p2PSA) levels and provide additional predictive value to prostate health index for prostate cancer.', 'Genome-wide association study of serum prostate-specific antigen levels based on 1000 Genomes imputed data in Japanese: the Japan Multi-Institutional Collaborative Cohort Study.', 'Novel loci for childhood body mass index and shared heritability with adult cardiometabolic traits.', 'Gene‒Prostate-Specific-Antigen-Guided Personalized Screening for Prostate Cancer.']"""

Theoretical models of FCR suggest that patients with elevated levels of FCR will more frequently consult health care professionals for reassurance about their health. However, the relationship between FCR and health care utilization has not yet been firmly established. We examined the relationship between FCR and quantity of medications, number of emergency room (ER) visits, outpatient visits, specialist visits, allied health visits, and hospital overnight visits.  Methods:   A total of 231 participants diagnosed with breast, colon, prostate, or lung cancer in the past 10 years were recruited from a cancer survivor registry. Participants were sent a survey package that included demographic and medical characteristics, a health care utilization questionnaire, and the Fear of Cancer Recurrence Inventory.  Results:   A multiple regression analysis indicated that higher FCR significantly predicted greater number of outpatient visits in the past 6 months (ß = .016, F(1, 193) = 5.08, p = .025). A hierarchical multiple regression indicated that higher FCR significantly predicted greater number of ER visits in the past 6 months when controlling for relationship status and education level (F(1, 179) = 4.00, p = .047).  Conclusions:   The relationship between FCR and health care use has been understudied. Results indicate that patients with elevated FCR may indeed use more health care services. We recommend that clinicians monitor health care use in patients who are struggling with FCR.""","""['Sophie Lebel', 'Christina Tomei', 'Andrea Feldstain', 'Sara Beattie', 'Megan McCallum']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Support Care Cancer""","""['Anxiety and fear of cancer recurrence and its association with supportive care needs and health-care service utilization in cancer patients.', 'Fear of cancer recurrence and unmet needs among breast cancer survivors in the first five years.

In this study, we found a novel function for FoxA1 in defining the cell-type specificity of AR- and GR-binding events in a distinct fashion, namely, for AR in LNCaP-1F5 cells and for GR in VCaP cells. We also found different, cell-type and receptor-specific compilations of cis-elements enriched adjacent to the AR- and GR-binding sites. The AR pathway is central in prostate cancer biology, but the role of GR is poorly known. We find that AR and GR cistromes and transcription programs exhibit significant overlap, and GR regulates a large number of genes considered to be AR pathway-specific. This raises questions about the role of GR in maintaining the AR pathway under androgen-deprived conditions in castration-resistant prostate cancer patients. However, in the presence of androgen, ligand-occupied GR acts as a partial antiandrogen and attenuates the AR-dependent transcription program. .""","""['Biswajyoti Sahu', 'Marko Laakso', 'Päivi Pihlajamaa', 'Kristian Ovaska', 'Ievgenii Sinielnikov', 'Sampsa Hautaniemi', 'Olli A Jänne']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Cancer Res""","""['Novel steroid receptor phyto-modulator compound a inhibits growth and survival of prostate cancer cells.', 'The expression of glucocorticoid receptor is negatively regulated by active androgen receptor signaling in prostate tumors.', 'Dual role of FoxA1 in androgen receptor binding to chromatin, androgen signalling and prostate cancer.', 'Is the glucocorticoid receptor a key player in prostate cancer?: A literature review.', 'Pioneer of prostate cancer: past, present and the future of FOXA1.', 'Lineage plasticity and treatment resistance in prostate cancer: the intersection of genetics, epigenetics, and evolution.', 'Cellular specificity of androgen receptor, coregulators, and pioneer factors in prostate cancer.', 'A role for androgen receptor variant 7 in sensitivity to therapy: Involvement of IGFBP-2 and FOXA1.', 'Comparative and integrative analysis of transcriptomic and epigenomic-wide DNA methylation changes in African American prostate cancer.', 'Glucocorticoid regulation of cancer development and progression.']"""

Objective:   : To examine limitations of basing screening policy on evidence from screening trials.  Methods:   We reviewed published modeling studies that examined population and trial data. The studies (1) project the roles of screening and changes in primary treatment in the US mortality decline; (2) extrapolate the ERSPC mortality reduction to the long-term US setting; (3) estimate overdiagnosis based on US incidence trends; and (4) quantify the impact of control arm screening on PLCO mortality results.  Results:   Screening plausibly explains 45% and changes in primary treatment can explain 33% of the US prostate cancer mortality decline. Extrapolating the ERSPC results to the long-term US setting implies an absolute mortality reduction at least 5 times greater than that observed in the trial. Approximately 28% of screen-detected cases are overdiagnosed in the United States versus 58% of screen-detected cases suggested by the ERSPC results. Control arm screening can explain the null result in the PLCO trial.
