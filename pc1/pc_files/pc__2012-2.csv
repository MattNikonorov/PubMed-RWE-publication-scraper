In addition, we examined the extent to which exercise dose and clinical characteristics of cancer survivors influence the relationship between exercise and reductions in depressive symptoms.  Methods:   We conducted a systematic search identifying randomized controlled trials of exercise interventions among adult cancer survivors, examining depressive symptoms as an outcome. We calculated effect sizes for each study and performed weighted multiple regression moderator analysis.  Results:   We identified 40 exercise interventions including 2,929 cancer survivors. Diverse groups of cancer survivors were examined in seven exercise interventions; breast cancer survivors were examined in 26; prostate cancer, leukemia, and lymphoma were examined in two; and colorectal cancer in one. Cancer survivors who completed an exercise intervention reduced depression more than controls, d(+) = -0.13 (95% CI: -0.26, -0.01). Increases in weekly volume of aerobic exercise reduced depressive symptoms in dose-response fashion (β = -0.24, p = 0.03), a pattern evident only in higher quality trials. Exercise reduced depressive symptoms most when exercise sessions were supervised (β = -0.26, p = 0.01) and when cancer survivors were between 47-62 yr (β = 0.27, p = 0.01).  Conclusion:   Exercise training provides a small overall reduction in depressive symptoms among cancer survivors but one that increased in dose-response fashion with weekly volume of aerobic exercise in high quality trials. Depressive symptoms were reduced to the greatest degree among breast cancer survivors, among cancer survivors aged between 47-62 yr, or when exercise sessions were supervised.""","""['Justin C Brown', 'Tania B Huedo-Medina', 'Linda S Pescatello', 'Stacey M Ryan', 'Shannon M Pescatello', 'Emily Moker', 'Jessica M LaCroix', 'Rebecca A Ferrer', 'Blair T Johnson']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Exercise interventions on health-related quality of life for people with cancer during active treatment.', 'Exercise effects on depressive symptoms in cancer survivors: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Modality of exercise influences rate of decrease in depression for cancer survivors with elevated depressive symptomatology.', 'Efficacy of exercise interventions in modulating cancer-related fatigue among adult cancer survivors: a meta-analysis.', 'The effect of aerobic exercise on self-esteem and depressive and anxiety symptoms among breast cancer survivors.', 'The Role of Long-Term Physical Activity in Relation to Cancer-Related Health Outcomes: A 12-Month Follow-up of the Phys-Can RCT.', 'Preferences and engagement with physical activity resources among cancer survivors during the COVID-19 pandemic.', 'Mitigating long-term and delayed adverse events associated with cancer treatment: implications for survivorship.', 'Recent Findings in Physical Exercise for Cancer Survivors.', 'Breast Tissue Reconstruction Using Polycaprolactone Ball Scaffolds in a Partial Mastectomy Pig Model.']"""

Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors have been reported to have antitumor activity in different malignancies and immunomodulatory effects. Herein, we report the Tregs-targeting and immune-promoting effect of a class I specific HDAC inhibitor, entinostat, in combination with either IL-2 in a murine renal cell carcinoma (RENCA) model or a survivin-based vaccine therapy (SurVaxM) in a castration resistant prostate cancer (CR Myc-CaP) model.  Methods and results:   RENCA or CR Myc-CaP tumors were implanted orthotopically or subcutaneously, respectively. Inoculated mice were randomized into four treatment groups: vehicle, entinostat, cytokine or vaccine, and combination. Tregs in the blood were assessed by FACS analysis. Real time quantitative PCR and Western blot analysis of isolated T cell subpopulations from spleen were performed to determine Foxp3 gene and protein expression. The suppressive function of Tregs was tested by T cell proliferation assay. Low dose (5 mg/kg) entinostat reduced Foxp3 levels in Tregs and this was associated with enhanced tumor growth inhibition in combination with either IL-2 or a SurVaxM vaccine. Entinostat down-regulated Foxp3 expression transcriptionally and blocked Tregs suppressive function without affecting T effector cells (Teffs). In vitro low dose entinostat (0.5 µM) induced STAT3 acetylation and a specific inhibitor of STAT3 partially rescued entinostat-induced down-regulation of Foxp3, suggesting that STAT3 signaling is involved in Foxp3 down-regulation by entinostat.  Conclusions:   These results demonstrate a novel immunomodulatory effect of class I HDAC inhibition and provide a rationale for the clinical testing of entinostat to enhance cancer immunotherapy.""","""['Li Shen', 'Michael Ciesielski', 'Swathi Ramakrishnan', 'Kiersten M Miles', 'Leigh Ellis', 'Paula Sotomayor', 'Protul Shrikant', 'Robert Fenstermaker', 'Roberto Pili']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Synergistic in vivo antitumor effect of the histone deacetylase inhibitor MS-275 in combination with interleukin 2 in a murine model of renal cell carcinoma.', 'Cooperative Immune-Mediated Mechanisms of the HDAC Inhibitor Entinostat, an IL15 Superagonist, and a Cancer Vaccine Effectively Synergize as a Novel Cancer Therapy.', 'Entinostat Neutralizes Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells and Enhances the Antitumor Effect of PD-1 Inhibition in Murine Models of Lung and Renal Cell Carcinoma.', 'Entinostat for the treatment of breast cancer.', 'Histone deacetylase inhibitors and transplantation.', 'Epigenetic regulation and therapeutic targets in the tumor microenvironment.', 'Epigenetic regulation in the tumor microenvironment: molecular mechanisms and therapeutic targets.', 'A study of using epigenetic modulators to enhance response to pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in microsatellite stable advanced colorectal cancer.', 'Epigenetic modulation and prostate cancer: Paving the way for NK cell anti-tumor immunity.', 'HDAC3 is critical in tumor development and therapeutic resistance in Kras-mutant non-small cell lung cancer.']"""

However, models of angiogenesis by human endothelial cells localized within an intact human prostate tissue architecture are until now extremely limited. This report characterizes the burst of angiogenesis by endogenous human blood vessels in primary xenografts of fresh surgical specimens of benign prostate or prostate cancer (CaP) tissue that occurs between Days 6-14 after transplantation into SCID mice pre-implanted with testosterone pellets. The wave of human angiogenesis was preceded by androgen-mediated up-regulation of VEGF-A expression in the stromal compartment. The neo-vessel network anastomosed to the host mouse vascular system between Days 6-10 post-transplantation, the angiogenic response ceased by Day 15, and by Day 30 the vasculature had matured and stabilized, as indicated by a lack of leakage of serum components into the interstitial tissue space and by association of nascent endothelial cells with mural cells/pericytes. The angiogenic wave was concurrent with the appearance of a reactive stroma phenotype, as determined by staining for α-SMA, Vimentin, Tenascin, Calponin, Desmin and Masson's trichrome, but the reactive stroma phenotype appeared to be largely independent of androgen availability. Transplantation-induced angiogenesis by endogenous human endothelial cells present in primary xenografts of benign and malignant human prostate tissue was preceded by induction of androgen-driven expression of VEGF by the prostate stroma, and was concurrent with and the appearance of a reactive stroma phenotype. Androgen-modulated expression of VEGF-A appeared to be a causal regulator of angiogenesis, and possibly of stromal activation, in human prostate xenografts.""","""['Viviana P Montecinos', 'Alejandro Godoy', 'Jennifer Hinklin', 'R Robert Vethanayagam', 'Gary J Smith']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Androgen deprivation induces rapid involution and recovery of human prostate vasculature.', 'Phenotypic characterization of human prostatic stromal cells in primary cultures derived from human tissue samples.', 'Short-term human prostate primary xenografts: an in vivo model of human prostate cancer vasculature and angiogenesis.', 'Role of androgen and vitamin D receptors in endothelial cells from benign and malignant human prostate.', 'Tumor-stroma interactions directing phenotype and progression of epithelial skin tumor cells.', 'Role of prostate stem cells and treatment strategies in benign prostate hyperplasia.', 'D-Propranolol Impairs EGFR Trafficking and Destabilizes Mutant p53 Counteracting AKT Signaling and Tumor Malignancy.', 'Cytokines and Chemokines as Mediators of Prostate Cancer Metastasis.', 'Recapitulation of prostate tissue cell type-specific transcriptomes by an in vivo primary prostate tissue xenograft model.', 'Protective effect of stromal Dickkopf-3 in prostate cancer: opposing roles for TGFBI and ECM-1.']"""

The aim of this study was to examine the effect of surgically induced weight loss on serum testosterone, DHEA and PSA levels in obese men.  Methods:   Consecutive men undergoing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) participated in a prospective, longitudinal study. Main outcomes were changes were body mass index (BMI), percentage excess weight loss, serum levels of testosterone, DHEA and PSA, PSA mass and plasma volume, measured before operation and 3, 6 and 12 months later.  Results:   In 64 patients, mean BMI fell from 48.2 kg/m(2) before operation to 39.2, 35.6 and 32.4 kg/m(2) at 3, 6 and 12 months after RYGB. Testosterone levels rose significantly from 259 ng/dl to 386, 452 and 520 ng/dl respectively. Serum PSA levels increased significantly from 0.51 ng/ml to 0.67 ng/ml at 12 months. There were no significant changes in DHEA or PSA mass.  Conclusion:   RYGB normalizes the serum testosterone level. PSA levels increase with weight loss and may be inversely correlated with changes in plasma volume, indicating that PSA levels may be artificially low in obese men owing to haemodilution.""","""['G Woodard', 'S Ahmed', 'V Podelski', 'T Hernandez-Boussard', 'J Presti Jr', 'J M Morton']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Br J Surg""","""['Short-term outcomes for super-super obese (BMI > or =60 kg/m2) patients undergoing weight loss surgery at a high-volume bariatric surgery center: laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding, laparoscopic gastric bypass, and open tubular gastric bypass.', 'The effect of obesity and lower serum prostate-specific antigen levels on prostate-cancer screening results in American men.', 'Obesity and screening PSA levels among men undergoing an annual physical exam.', 'Effect of ageing and body mass index on prostate-specific antigen levels among Chinese men in Singapore from a community-based study.', 'Prostate-specific antigen changes and prostate cancer in hypogonadal men treated with testosterone replacement therapy.', 'Bone Health after Bariatric Surgery: Consequences, Prevention, and Treatment.', 'Obesity, Body Composition, and Sex Hormones: Implications for Cardiovascular Risk.', 'Impact of Bariatric Surgery on Male Sex Hormones and Sperm Quality: a Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'MOSH Syndrome (Male Obesity Secondary Hypogonadism): Clinical Assessment and Possible Therapeutic Approaches.', 'Changes in Testosterone Levels and Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin Levels in Extremely Obese Men after Bariatric Surgery.']"""

Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for prostate cancer causes drastic hormonal changes that alter both disease and host factors. We measured inflammatory and angiogenic biomarkers in ADT-treated and control groups of men with prostate cancer.  Materials and methods:   Baseline and 12-week plasma samples were collected from 37 ADT-naïve men with locally advanced or recurrent prostate cancer. Of those, 23 initiated ADT with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist and 14 served as nontreatment controls. Samples were tested for a panel of angiogenic and inflammatory biomarkers.  Results:   The treatment group had significantly higher concentrations of the inflammatory biomarkers interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and stromal cell-derived factor (SDF)-1α. None of the angiogenic biomarkers were significantly different between the groups at baseline. Among patients with a short prostate-specific antigen (PSA) doubling time (<6 months), the proangiogenic factor basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) was lower at baseline. In the treatment group, plasma placental growth factor (PlGF) increased and IL-6 decreased after 12 weeks of ADT. Moreover, the treatment group continued to have significantly higher concentrations of the inflammatory biomarkers IL-1β, IL-8, and SDF-1α as well as bFGF than controls.  Discussion:   These men were characterized by elevations in several traditional markers of aggressive disease and also by higher levels of several inflammatory biomarkers. Although ADT decreased IL-6 levels, IL-1β, IL-8, and SDF-1α remained significantly higher than in controls.

Visualization of tumors was achieved by the delivery of mono- and divalent radiolabeled haptens. To improve the ability to image tumors with bsMAb, we have combined the pretargeting approach with targeting of high specific activity radiotracer labeled negatively charged polymers. The tumor antigen-specific antibody was replaced with bombesin (Bom), a ligand that binds specifically to the growth receptors that are overexpressed by many tumors including prostate cancer. Bomanti- diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) bispecific antibody complexes were used to demonstrate pretargeting and imaging of very small human prostate cancer xenografts targeted with high specific activity ¹¹¹In- or ⁹⁹mTc-labeled negatively charged polymers.  Methods:   Bispecific antibody complexes consisting of intact anti-DTPA antibody or Fab′ linked to Bom via thioether bonds (Bom-bsCx or Bom-bsFCx, respectively) were used to pretarget PC-3 human prostate cancer xenografts in SCID mice. Negative control mice were pretargeted with Bom or anti-DTPA Ab. 111In-Labeled DTPA-succinyl polylysine (DSPL) was injected intravenously at 24 h (7.03 ± 1.74 or 6.88 ± 1.89 MBq ¹¹¹In-DSPL) after Bom-bsCx or 50 ± 5.34 MBq of ⁹⁹mTc-DSPL after Bom-bsFCx pretargeting, respectively. Planar or single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)/CT gamma images were obtained for up to 3 h and only planar images at 24 h. After imaging, all mice were killed and biodistribution of 111In or 99mTc activities were determined by scintillation counting.  Results:   Both planar and SPECT/CT imaging enabled detection of PC-3 prostate cancer lesions less than 1-2 mm in diameter in 1-3 h post 111In-DSPL injection. No lesions were visualized in Bom or anti-DTPA Ab pretargeted controls. 111In-DSPL activity in Bom-bsCx pretargeted tumors (1.21 ± 0.36 %ID/g) was 5.4 times that in tumors pretargeted with Bom or anti-DTPA alone (0.22 ± 0.08, p = 0.001). PC-3 xenografts pretargeted with Bom-bsFCx and targeted with ⁹⁹mTc-DSPL were visualizable by 1-3 h. Exquisite tumor uptake at 24 h (6.54 ± 1.58 %ID/g) was about 15 times greater than that of Bom pretargeted controls (0.44 ± 0.17, p = 0.002).

However, with current technology, distinction between local and distant recurrent PCa is not possible. This lack of an accurate test constrains the decision whether to offer systemic or local treatment. We hypothesise tests for detecting circulating tumour cells (CTCs) within the blood may assist with clinical decision-making and in this pilot study we investigated whether CTCs could be detected in this patient population using the CellSearch® system.  Materials and methods:   Blood samples were collected from PCa patients (n=26) prior to RT and 3 months following completion of RT. Samples were analysed for PSA level via immunoassay and CTC number using the CellSearch® system.  Results:   CTCs could be detected in this patient population and following RT CTCs appeared to decrease. However, no association was observed between a higher PSA and an increased number of CTCs pre- or post-RT. Interestingly, patients who failed RT trended toward an increased/ unchanged number of CTCs following RT vs. a decreased number in patients with RT response.  Conclusions:   Our results demonstrate that CTCs can be detected in early-stage PCa and suggest the possibility that post-treatment reduction in CTC levels may be indicative of RT response . We are currently evaluating CTCs in a larger cohort of patients to validate our preliminary findings and further investigate the prognostic value of CTCs in this patient population.""","""['Lori E Lowes', 'Michael Lock', 'George Rodrigues', ""David D'Souza"", 'Glenn Bauman', 'Belal Ahmad', 'Varagur Venkatesan', 'Alison L Allan', 'Tracy Sexton']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Clin Transl Oncol""","""['Limited prognostic value of preoperative circulating tumor cells for early biochemical recurrence in patients with localized prostate cancer.', 'The significance of circulating tumor cells in prostate cancer patients undergoing adjuvant or salvage radiation therapy.', 'Very low rate of circulating tumour cells (CTCs) in patients with PSA recurrence after radical prostatectomy referred to salvage radiotherapy.', 'Early salvage radiotherapy following radical prostatectomy.', 'Analysis of Circulating Tumor Cells in Prostate Cancer Patients at PSA Recurrence and Review of the Literature.', 'Liquid Biopsy in Diagnosis and Prognosis of Non-Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Circulating tumor cells in the early detection of human cancers.', 'Improving the diagnosis of prostate cancer by telomerase-positive circulating tumor cells: A prospective pilot study.', 'Does Direct and Indirect Exposure to Ionising Radiation Influence the Metastatic Potential of Breast Cancer Cells.', 'Clinical Impact of Circulating Tumor Cells in Patients with Localized Prostate Cancer.']"""

Our results confirm an increased lamin A/C protein expression in high-risk cancers and show association of expression with tumor cell formations at the invasion fronts of tumors and in invasion 'spearheading' tumor cell clusters. In the prostate tumor cell lines, LNCaP, DU145, and PC3 small hairpin RNA knockdown or overexpression of lamin A/C resulted in inhibition or stimulation, respectively, of cell growth, colony formation, migration and invasion. Further mechanism studies suggested that the lamin A/C-related malignant behavior is regulated through modulation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT/PTEN signaling pathway. Western blot results indicated that knockdown or overexpression of lamin A/C decreased or increased, respectively, protein levels of the PI3K subunits p110 and p85 in all three cell lines; phosphor-AKT in the PTEN-negative cell lines LNCaP and PC3, and, increased or decreased, respectively, PTEN protein levels in PTEN-positive DU145 cells. Together, our data suggest that lamin A/C proteins are positively involved in malignant behavior of PC cells through the PI3K/AKT/PTEN pathway. Lamin A/C may represent a new oncogenic factor and a novel therapeutic target for PC.""","""['Lu Kong', 'Georg Schäfer', 'Huajie Bu', 'Yong Zhang', 'Yuxiang Zhang', 'Helmut Klocker']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Carcinogenesis""","""['Activation of PI3K-Akt signaling pathway promotes prostate cancer cell invasion.', 'Knockdown of Phospholipase Cε (PLCε) Inhibits Cell Proliferation via Phosphatase and Tensin Homolog Deleted on Chromosome 10 (PTEN)/AKT Signaling Pathway in Human Prostate Cancer.', 'PTEN loss mediated Akt activation promotes prostate tumor growth and metastasis via CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling.', 'Interplay Among PI3K/AKT, PTEN/FOXO and AR Signaling in Prostate Cancer.', 'The PI3K/AKT pathway in the pathogenesis of prostate cancer.', 'Overview of cellular homeostasis-associated nuclear envelope lamins and associated input signals.', 'Elevated Levels of Lamin A Promote HR and NHEJ-Mediated Repair Mechanisms in High-Grade Ovarian Serous Carcinoma Cell Line.', 'Tuning between Nuclear Organization and Functionality in Health and Disease.', 'Effect of the Rho-Kinase/ROCK Signaling Pathway on Cytoskeleton Components.', 'Nuclear envelope, chromatin organizers, histones, and DNA: The many achilles heels exploited across cancers.']"""

Materials and methods:   We reviewed data from 300 consecutive men eligible for AS (PSA ≤ 10 ng/ml, clinical stage T1c, Gleason score ≤ 6, <3 positive cores, extent of cancer in any core < 50%) who have undergone a radical prostatectomy (RP). Reclassification was defined as upstaged disease and/or upgraded disease in RP specimens.  Results:   Biopsy features showed 36% of CaP involving 2 cores and a mean total tumor length of 2.63 mm.

Methods and materials:   We analyzed the cases of 2234 men with localized prostate cancer treated between 1991 and 2007 with low-dose rate BT monotherapy (n = 457) or BT with supplemental external-beam radiotherapy (EBRT, n = 229), androgen suppression therapy (AST, n = 424), or both (n = 1124). All men had at least one high-risk factor (prostate-specific antigen >20 ng/mL, biopsy Gleason score 8-10, or clinical stage ≥T2c). Competing-risks multivariable regressions were performed to determine whether the presence of at least two high-risk factors was associated with an increased risk of PCSM, with adjustment for age, comorbidity, and the type of supplemental treatment.  Results:   The median follow-up time was 4.3 years. The number of men with at least two high-risk factors was highest in the group treated with BT, EBRT, and AST (21%), followed by BT plus EBRT or AST (13%), and BT alone (8%) (p(trend) < 0.001). The adjusted hazard ratio (AHR) for PCSM for those with at least two high-risk factors (as compared with one) was 4.8 (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.8-8.0; p < 0.001).

Methods and materials:   Ten patients with high-risk prostate cancer were treated with helical tomotherapy to a dose of 60 Gy in 20 fractions. The prostate, rectum, and bladder were recontoured on their daily megavoltage computed tomography scans and the dose was recalculated. The bladder and rectal volumes (in mL) receiving ≥100% and ≥70% of the prescribed dose in each fraction and in the original plans were recorded. A fraction for which the difference between planned and delivered was more than 2 mL was considered a volume failure. Similarly if the difference in the planned and delivered maximum dose (D(max)) was ≥1% for the rectum and bladder, the fraction was considered a dose failure. Each patient's first 3 to 5 fractions were analyzed to determine if they correctly identified those patients who would consistently fail (i.e., ≥20% of fractions) during the course of their radiotherapy.  Results:   Six parameters were studied; the rectal volume (RV) and bladder volumes (BV) (in mL) received ≥100% and ≥70% of the prescribed dose and maximum dose to 2 mL of the rectum and bladder.

Clinical T3/T4 patients were examined separately as the highest-risk group. Logistic regression was used to examine the association between patient group and receipt of each primary treatment, adjusting for age, race, year of diagnosis, marital status, Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results database region, and county-level education. Separate models were constructed for primary surgery, external-beam radiotherapy (RT), and conservative management.  Results:   On multivariable analysis, increasing likelihood of extraprostatic disease was significantly associated with increasing use of RT and decreased conservative management. Use of surgery also increased. Patients with >50% likelihood of extraprostatic cancer had almost twice the odds of receiving prostatectomy as those with <25% likelihood, and T3-T4 patients had 18% higher odds. Prostatectomy use increased in recent years.

However, whether exogenous insulin use for glycaemic control in diabetic patients could increase the risk of prostate cancer has rarely been studied. This is the first prospective follow-up study for up to 12 years to show that exogenous insulin use for glycaemic control in the diabetic patients is not significantly predictive for prostate cancer mortality.

Recent evidence indicates that the CXCR4/CXCL12 axis is involved in promoting invasion and metastasis in tumors. Thus, novel agents that can downregulate CXCR4 expression have therapeutic potential in repressing cancer metastasis. Among ED and its derivatives, it is found that ED downregulated the expression of both CXCR4 and HER2 without affecting cell viability in tumor cells. The suppression of CXCR4 expression by ED was found to correlate with the inhibition of CXCL12-induced migration and invasion of both DU145 and A549 cells. Besides, neither proteasome inhibition nor lysosomal stabilization had any effect on ED-induced decrease in CXCR4 expression. The basic molecular mechanisms unveiled that the downregulation of CXCR4 was at the transcriptional level, as indicated by downregulation of mRNA expression and suppression of NF-κB activation. Overall, our findings suggest that ED is a novel blocker of CXCR4 expression and, thus, has enormous potential as a powerful therapeutic agent for metastatic cancer.""","""['Sooho Ok', 'Sung-Moo Kim', 'Chulwon Kim', 'Dongwoo Nam', 'Bum Sang Shim', 'Sung-Hoon Kim', 'Kyoo Seok Ahn', 'Seung-Hoon Choi', 'Kwang Seok Ahn']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Immunopharmacol Immunotoxicol""","""['Emodin: inhibitory effects on growth in malignant tumors.', 'Peroxisome proliferator‑activated receptor\xa0γ agonist rosiglitazone inhibits migration and invasion of prostate cancer cells through inhibition of the CXCR4/CXCL12 axis.', 'Inhibition of CXCR4/CXCL12 signaling axis by ursolic acid leads to suppression of metastasis in transgenic adenocarcinoma of mouse prostate model.', 'Butein downregulates chemokine receptor CXCR4 expression and function through suppression of NF-κB activation in breast and pancreatic tumor cells.', 'The role of adhesion molecules and chemokine receptor CXCR4 (CD184) in small cell lung cancer.', 'Perspective: Cooperation of Nanog, NF-κΒ, and CXCR4 in a regulatory network for directed migration of cancer stem cells.', 'The versatile emodin: A natural easily acquired anthraquinone possesses promising anticancer properties against a variety of cancers.', 'Antiangiogenic Phytochemicals Constituent of Diet as Promising Candidates for Chemoprevention of Cancer.', 'Is Emodin with Anticancer Effects Completely Innocent?

Methodology/principal findings:   We developed an algorithm based on primary known adenocarcinoma for testing sensitivity and specificity. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue samples from 71 patients of unfavorable subsets of unknown primary adenocarcinoma were obtained. We examined 15 molecular markers using the algorithm incorporating these IPs and classified the tumours into 9 subsets based on the primary tumour site. The sensitivity and specificity of this algorithm were 80.3% and 97.6%, respectively. Apparent primary sites were lung in 17 patients, digestive organs in 13, gynecological organs in 9, prostate in 7, liver or kidney in 6, breast in 4, urothelial organ in 2, biliary tract and pancreatic profile in none, and unclassified in 13. The response rate to chemotherapy was highest for the gynecological IPs. Patients with gynecological or lung cancer IPs had longer median progression-free survival than those with others: 11.2 months for gynecological IPs (p<0.001) and 6.8 months for lung IPs (p = 0.05). Lung, digestive, prostate, and gynecological profiles were associated with significantly longer median survival time than the other profiles.

Experimental design:   We carried out β-catenin immunocytochemical analysis, evaluated TOP-flash reporter activity (a reporter of β-catenin-mediated transcription), and sequenced the β-catenin gene in MDA prostate cancer 118a, MDA prostate cancer 118b, MDA prostate cancer 2b, and PC-3 prostate cancer cells. We knocked down β-catenin in AR-negative MDA prostate cancer 118b cells and carried out comparative gene-array analysis. We also immunohistochemically analyzed β-catenin and AR in 27 bone metastases of human CRPCs.  Results:   β-Catenin nuclear accumulation and TOP-flash reporter activity were high in MDA prostate cancer 118b but not in MDA prostate cancer 2b or PC-3 cells. MDA prostate cancer 118a and MDA prostate cancer 118b cells carry a mutated β-catenin at codon 32 (D32G). Ten genes were expressed differently (false discovery rate, 0.05) in MDA prostate cancer 118b cells with downregulated β-catenin. One such gene, hyaluronan synthase 2 (HAS2), synthesizes hyaluronan, a core component of the extracellular matrix. We confirmed HAS2 upregulation in PC-3 cells transfected with D32G-mutant β-catenin. Finally, we found nuclear localization of β-catenin in 10 of 27 human tissue specimens; this localization was inversely associated with AR expression (P = 0.056, Fisher's exact test), suggesting that reduced AR expression enables Wnt/β-catenin signaling.  Conclusion:   We identified a previously unknown downstream target of β-catenin, HAS2, in prostate cancer, and found that high β-catenin nuclear localization and low or no AR expression may define a subpopulation of men with bone metastatic prostate cancer.

We report outcomes from the PLCO screening FSG program and evaluate the increased yield produced by a second FSG.  Methods:   Participants were screened by 60-cm FSG in 10 regional screening centers at study entry and 3 or 5 years later, depending on the time of random assignment. Results from subsequent diagnostic intervention were tracked and recorded in a standardized fashion, and outcomes were compared according to sex and age. The protocol discouraged repeat FSG in persons with colorectal cancer or adenoma diagnosed after the initial FSG.  Results:   Of 77 447 enrollees, 67 073 (86.6%) had at least one FSG and 39 443 (50.9%) had two FSGs. Diagnostic intervention occurred in 74.9% after a positive first FSG and in 78.7% after a positive repeat FSG. The second FSG increased the screening yield by 32%: Colorectal cancer or advanced adenoma was detected in 37.8 per 1000 persons after first screening and in 49.8 per 1000 persons after all screenings. The second FSG increased the yield of cancer or advanced adenoma by 26% in women and by 34% in men. Of 223 subjects who received a diagnosis of colorectal carcinoma within 1 year of a positive FSG, 64.6% had stage I and 17.5% had stage II disease.

By experimentally measuring the refractive index sensitivity of Au nanorods, the Au nanorod with an aspect ratio of ~3.5 was proven optimal for the LSPR sensing. To reduce the steric hindrance effect as well as to immobilize a large amount of ligand on the nanoparticle surface, various mixtures containing different molar ratios of HS(CH(2))(11)(OCH(2)CH(2))(6)OCH(2)COOH and HS(CH(2))(11)(OCH(2)CH(2))(3)OH were applied to form different self-assembled monolayer surfaces. The results showed that the best molar ratio for antibody conjugation was 1 : 10. When using individual Au nanorod sensors for the detection of prostate specific antigen (PSA), the lowest concentration recorded was ~1 aM (~6 × 10(5) molecules), corresponding to LSPR λ(max) shifts of ~4.2 nm.

Methods:   We examined the hypothesis that plasma miRNA levels can differentiate patients by aggressiveness in 82 PCa patients. Taqman based quantitative RT-PCR assays were performed to measure copy number of target miRNAs.  Results:   miR-20a was significantly overexpressed in plasma from patients with stage 3 tumors compared to stage 2 or below (P = 0.03). The expression levels for miR-20a and miR-21 were significantly increased in patients with high risk CAPRA scores (16,623 and 1,595 copies, respectively). Significantly increased miR-21 and miR-145 expression were observed for patients with intermediate or high risk D'Amico scores compared to patients with low risk scores (P = 0.047 and 0.011, respectively). The relapse rates for CAPRA scores ranged from 1.9% for low risk to 9.5% for intermediate risk and to 22.2% for high risk patients (P = 0.023). For D'Amico scores, the relapse rates ranged from 0.0% for low risk to 7.4% for intermediate risk and 17.6% for high risk patients (P = 0.039). Expression of miR-21 and miR-221 significantly differentiated patients with intermediate risk from those with low risk CAPRA scores (AUC = 0.801, P = 0.002). Four miRNAs (miR-20a, miR-21, miR-145, and miR-221) could also distinguish high versus low risk in PCa patients by D'Amico score with an AUC of 0.824.  Conclusions:   These preliminary data suggest that altered plasma miRNAs may be useful predictors to distinguish PCa patients with varied aggressiveness.

Methods:   Illumina's Human v2 miRNA microarray was used to analyze miRNAs levels in a small set of patients [25 CaP, 17 benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)] in an effort to identify CaP-specific miRNAs. The identified miRNAs were further examined by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) in the same small set of patients.

Results:   Five miRNAs were confirmed by qRT-PCR analysis in validation sets. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis showed all 5 miRNAs had diagnostic value. More importantly, further principal component analysis indicated component 1 extracted from expression data of the 5 miRNAs could differentiate CaP from BPH and healthy controls with high diagnosis performance, with an AUC of 0.924 and 0.860, respectively.  Conclusions:   Our data suggested that circulating miRNAs could serve as biomarkers for CaP, and compared to single miRNA, the 5 miRNAs panel can accurately discriminate CaP from BPH and healthy controls with high sensitivity and specificity, and therefore, combined with routine PSA test, these 5 CaP-specific miRNAs may help improve CaP diagnosis in clinical application.""","""['Zhang-Hui Chen', 'Guang-Lin Zhang', 'Huan-Rong Li', 'Jin-Dan Luo', 'Zhong-Xiang Li', 'Ge-Ming Chen', 'Jun Yang']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Serum human glandular kallikrein (hK2) and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) improve the discrimination between prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia in combination with total and %free PSA.', 'Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) and IGF-binding protein-3 in benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer.', 'Differential blood-based diagnosis between benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer: miRNA as source for biomarkers independent of PSA level, Gleason score, or TNM status.', 'A review of expression profiling of circulating microRNAs in men with prostate cancer.', 'Circulating microRNAs: macro-utility as markers of prostate cancer?', 'The Potential of MicroRNAs as Non-Invasive Prostate Cancer Biomarkers: A Systematic Literature Review Based on a Machine Learning Approach.', 'Prostate Cancer-Associated miRNAs in Saliva: First Steps to an Easily Accessible and Reliable Screening Tool.', 'In Vivo Anticancer Evaluation of 6b, a Non-Covalent Imidazo1,2-aquinoxaline-Based Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Inhibitor against Human Xenograft Tumor in Nude Mice.', 'Diagnostic Value of Prostate-Specific Antigen Combined with Plasma miRNA-149 Expression in Patients with Prostate Cancer Based on Experimental Data and Bioinformatics.', 'miRNAs in Cancer (Review of Literature).']"""

Directional and isotropic dose kernels generated using Monte Carlo simulations based on Best Industries model 2301 I-125 source are utilized for treatment planning. The newly developed GH algorithm is employed for optimization of the treatment plans for seven interstitial prostate brachytherapy cases using mixed sources (directional brachytherapy) and using only isotropic sources (conventional brachytherapy).

The simulations demonstrated that the use of directional sources in the low dose-rate (LDR) brachytherapy of the prostate clearly benefits in sparing the urethra and the rectum sensitive structures from overdose. The time taken for a conventional treatment plan is less than three seconds, while the time taken for a mixed source treatment plan is less than nine seconds, as tested on an Intel Core2 Duo 2.2 GHz processor with 1GB RAM.

From clinical investigations, prostate cancer has been shown to be among the most hypoxic of the cancers investigated. Many solid tumors contain regions of hypoxia due to poor organization and efficiency of the vasculature. However, hypoxia is typically not present in normal tissue. Nitroimidazoles, a thoroughly investigated class of hypoxia selective drugs, have been shown to be highly retained in hypoxic tissues. The purpose of this study is to determine if the incorporation of hypoxia trapping moieties into the structural paradigm of BB2r-targeted peptides will increase the retention time of the agents in prostate cancer tumors. The present work involves the design, syntheses, purification, and in vitro investigation of hypoxia enhanced (111)In-BB2r-targeted radioconjugates. A total of four BB2r-targeted conjugates (1-4) were synthesized and coupled with increasing numbers of 2-nitroimidazoles, a hypoxia trapping moiety. Conjugates were radiolabeled with (111)In and purified by HPLC prior to in vitro studies. Receptor saturation assays under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions showed that the BB2r receptor expression on the PC-3 human prostate cancer cell line was not significantly affected by oxygen levels. Competitive binding assays revealed that incorporation of 2-nitroimidazoles had a detrimental effect to BB2r binding when adequate spacer groups, between the hypoxia trapping agent and the pharmacophore, were not employed. All of the 2-nitroimidazole containing BB2r-targeted agents exhibited significantly higher longitudinal retention in PC-3 cells under hypoxic conditions compared to the analogous normoxic studies. Protein association analysis revealed a 3-fold increase in binding of a 2-nitroimidazole containing BB2r-targeted agent under hypoxic relative to normoxic conditions. The positive nature of these results indicate that further exploration into the potential of hypoxia selective trapping agents for BB2r-targeted agents, as well as other targeted compounds, is warranted.""","""['Nilesh K Wagh', 'Zhengyuan Zhou', 'Sunny M Ogbomo', 'Wen Shi', 'Susan K Brusnahan', 'Jered C Garrison']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Bioconjug Chem""","""['Synthesis and in vitro and in vivo evaluation of hypoxia-enhanced 111In-bombesin conjugates for prostate cancer imaging.', 'Evaluation of the pharmacokinetic effects of various linking group using the 111In-DOTA-X-BBN(7-14)NH2 structural paradigm in a prostate cancer model.', 'Comparative Study of Subcutaneous and Orthotopic Mouse Models of Prostate Cancer: Vascular Perfusion, Vasculature Density, Hypoxic Burden and BB2r-Targeting Efficacy.', 'Cancer chemotherapy based on targeting of cytotoxic peptide conjugates to their receptors on tumors.', 'Preclinical development and current status of the fluorinated 2-nitroimidazole hypoxia probe N-(2-hydroxy-3,3,3-trifluoropropyl)-2-(2-nitro-1-imidazolyl) acetamide (SR 4554, CRC 94/17): a non-invasive diagnostic probe for the measurement of tumor hypoxia by magnetic resonance spectroscopy and imaging, and by positron emission tomography.', 'Biological reduction of nitroimidazole-functionalized gold nanorods for photoacoustic imaging of tumor hypoxia.', 'Development of Improved Tumor-Residualizing, GRPR-Targeted Agents: Preclinical Comparison of an Endolysosomal Trapping Approach in Agonistic and Antagonistic Constructs.', 'Synthesis and Evaluation of Radiolabeled Phosphoramide Mustard with Selectivity for Hypoxic Cancer Cells.', 'Synthesis and in vitro and in vivo evaluation of hypoxia-enhanced 111In-bombesin conjugates for prostate cancer imaging.', 'Bombesin analogue-mediated delivery preferentially enhances the cytotoxicity of a mitochondria-disrupting peptide in tumor cells.']"""

Methods:   The data for cancers of esophagus, stomach, bladder, colorectal, lung, prostate, and female breast along with their risk factors in all 30 provinces of Iran for the year 2007 were included into study. Smoking, overweight, inadequate consumption of fruits and vegetables, socioeconomic status and low physical activity were studied as risk factors. Standardized incidence ratios were estimated using full bayesian model. In addition, the shared component model was used to explore the spatial pattern of the cancers and to estimate the relative importance of their corresponding risk factors.  Results:   Fars and the Northwestern provinces were observed as high risk areas and Hormozgan (a Persian Gulf coastal province), Sistan and Baluchestan, South Khorasan, and Kerman provinces located in Southeast were areas of low risk for most cancers. For all five risk factors, larger effects on incidence of the relevant cancers were found in the Northern provinces compared to other areas. Smoking, overweight, inadequate consumption of fruit and vegetable, socioeconomic status, and low physical activity were found to have more effects on incidence of stomach, breast, esophagus, and breast cancers, respectively.

The methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene play a critical role in cancer development, but its potential impact on prostate cancer has not been well studied. The C677T variant lies in exon 4 at the folate binding site of the MTHFR gene and results in substitution of an alanine by a valine residue. The present study was carried out 55 cases with prostate cancer and 50 healthy men. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR), restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), and agarose gel electrophoresis techniques were employed to determine MTHFR C677T mutation. The frequencies of the CT genotype (p= 0.025) and T allele (p= 0.023) was found to be higher in control subjects when compared with patients group. No statistical difference was found between the alleles of MTHFR and PSA levels after (PSA-BT)/ before (PSA-AT) antiandrogen treatment or tumor stages.

Patients and methods:   • From 1989 to 2001, we calculated two serial PSAV measurements in 18 214 prostate cancer screening-study participants, of whom 1125 (6.2%) were diagnosed with prostate cancer. • The PSAV risk count was determined as the number of PSAV measurements of >0.4 ng/mL/year (0, 1, or 2). • We used receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and reclassification analyses to examine the ability of PSAV risk count to predict screen-detected and high-grade prostate cancer.  Results:   • The PSAV was >0.4 ng/mL/year twice (risk count 2) in 40% of prostate cancer cases compared with only 4% of those with no cancer (P < 0.001). • After adjusting for age and PSA level, a PSAV risk count of 2 was associated with an 8.2-fold increased risk of prostate cancer (95% confidence interval 7.0-9.6, P < 0.001) and 5.4-fold increased risk of Gleason score 8-10 prostate cancer on biopsy. • Compared with a model with age and PSA level, the addition of the PSAV risk count significantly improved discrimination (area under the ROC curve 0.625 vs 0.725, P= 0.031) and reclassified individuals for the risk of high-grade prostate cancer (net reclassification, P < 0.001).  Conclusions:   • Sustained rises in PSA indicate a significantly greater risk of prostate cancer, particularly high-grade disease. • Compared with men with a risk count of ≤1, those with two PSAV measurements of >0.4 ng/mL/year (risk count 2) had an 8-fold increased risk of prostate cancer and 5.4-fold increased risk of Gleason 8-10 disease on biopsy, adjusting for age and PSA level. • Compared to PSA alone, PSAV risk count may be useful in reducing unnecessary biopsies and the diagnosis of low-risk prostate cancer.""","""['Stacy Loeb', 'E Jeffrey Metter', 'Donghui Kan', 'Kimberly A Roehl', 'William J Catalona']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Re: Prostate-specific antigen velocity (PSAV) risk count improves the specificity of screening for clinically significant prostate cancer.', 'Prostate-specific antigen velocity and prostate cancer gleason grade and stage.', 'Prostate-specific antigen velocity risk count assessment: a new concept for detection of life-threatening prostate cancer during window of curability.', 'Prostate-specific antigen velocity in a prospective prostate cancer screening study of men with genetic predisposition.', 'The role of prostate-specific antigen velocity in prostate cancer early detection.', 'PSA velocity: a systematic review of clinical applications.', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen Trends Predict the Probability of Prostate Cancer in a Very Large U.S. Veterans Affairs Cohort.', 'Biomarkers for Prostate Biopsy and Risk Stratification of Newly Diagnosed Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'Prostate cancer screening with prostate-specific antigen: A guide to the guidelines.', 'Ratio of prostate specific antigen to the outer gland volume of prostrate as a predictor for prostate cancer.', 'Prostate-specific Antigen Velocity Risk Count to Discern Significant From Indolent Prostate Cancer.']"""

Results:   Men looking online for information about treatment options for PCa are exposed to a range of decision-making processes. Just under half (49.6%) of the messages reported non-systematic decision processes, with deferral to the doctor and proof of cancer removal being the most common. For systematic processing (36.5%), messages most commonly considered treatment outcomes and side-effects. Processes did not vary between the blogs and online forums.

The latter included 16 (80%) with positive apical margins, 2 (10%) incised intraprostatic margins, and 1 (5%) soft tissue margin. Two-colour triple antibody stain using a cocktail of antibodies against α-methylacyl coenzyme A racemase (AMACR), high molecular weight keratin and p63 was performed on all the selected cases.  Results:   In 10/10 specimens with crushed benign glands, basal cell staining continued to be detectable, while AMACR staining was negative in all cases (0/10). In the positive margin cases, none of the crushed glands expressed basal cell marker staining (0/20), whereas 14/20 (70%) of the cases showed variable levels of AMACR positivity at the inked margin.  Conclusion:   Two-colour triple antibody cocktail stain is useful in the assessment of most, but not all, surgical margins with crushed artefact in prostatectomy specimens by helping to establish whether glands are malignant or benign.""","""['Najla Al Daoud', 'Gangyong Li', 'Andrew J Evans', 'Theodorus H van der Kwast']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""J Clin Pathol""","""['Alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase (P504S)/34betaE12/p63 triple cocktail stain in prostatic adenocarcinoma after hormonal therapy.', 'Immunohistochemical antibody cocktail staining (p63/HMWCK/AMACR) of ductal adenocarcinoma and Gleason pattern 4 cribriform and noncribriform acinar adenocarcinomas of the prostate.', 'Reliability of the 34βE12, keratin 5/6, p63, bcl-2, and AMACR in the diagnosis of prostate carcinoma.', 'Application of alpha-methylacyl coenzyme A racemase immunohistochemistry in the diagnosis of prostate cancer: a review.', 'Best practices recommendations in the application of immunohistochemistry in the prostate: report from the International Society of Urologic Pathology consensus conference.', 'Immunohistochemistry and mass spectrometry for highly multiplexed cellular molecular imaging.']"""

As autophagy can promote either cell survival or death, it is important to understand its role in PCa treatment. The objective of this study was to elucidate the function of autophagy in lipid droplet (LD) homeostasis and survival in androgen-sensitive PCa cells.  Methods:   To produce androgen deprivation, charcoal filtered serum or the androgen inhibitor casodex were used in LNCaP and LAPC4 cells. Autophagy was monitored by immunofluorescence/confocal microscopy and immunoblot analysis. Levels of intracellular LDs and triacyglycerols after the inhibition of autophagy by 3-methyladenine, bafilomycin A(1) , or si-ATG5 were quantified by three independent methods, Oil Red O staining, triacyglycerols lipase assay, and nuclear magnetic resonance.  Results:   Androgen deprivation induced autophagy and the depletion of LDs in both of the androgen-sensitive PCa cell lines examined, whereas the blockage of autophagy by pharmacological or genetic means inhibited LD degradation and therefore lipolysis and cell growth. In addition, under androgen deprivation, increased colocalization of LDs and autophagic vesicles was observed in LNCaP cells, which can be further enhanced by blocking the autophagic flux.  Conclusion:   Autophagy mediates LD degradation and lipolysis in androgen-sensitive PCa cells during androgen deprivation which aids the survival of PCa cells during hormone therapy.""","""['Ramesh R Kaini', 'Laurel O Sillerud', 'Siqin Zhaorigetu', 'Chien-An A Hu']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Androgen deprivation and androgen receptor competition by bicalutamide induce autophagy of hormone-resistant prostate cancer cells and confer resistance to apoptosis.', 'Does androgen-ablation therapy (AAT) associated autophagy have a pro-survival effect in LNCaP human prostate cancer cells?', 'Comparison of the effect of the antiandrogen apalutamide (ARN-509) versus bicalutamide on the androgen receptor pathway in prostate cancer cell lines.', 'Casodex: preclinical studies and controversies.', 'The development of Casodex (bicalutamide): preclinical studies.', 'Label-Free Imaging of Lipid Droplets in Prostate Cells Using Stimulated Raman Scattering Microscopy and Multivariate Analysis.', 'Focused Design of Novel Cyclic Peptides Endowed with GABARAP-Inhibiting Activity.', 'Targeting autophagy in prostate cancer: preclinical and clinical evidence for therapeutic response.', 'Biogenesis and Breakdown of Lipid Droplets in Pathological Conditions.', 'The regulation, function, and role of lipophagy, a form of selective autophagy, in metabolic disorders.']"""

Pattern recognition methods have the potential to discriminate tumour from normal tissue using the spectral patterns of magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging data thus providing a powerful tool for diagnosis and monitoring treatment of prostate cancer. Prostate magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging data acquisition has been optimized for a flat baseline, including a long echo time and the use of water and fat suppression pulses. Despite this acquisition method, lipid resonances may still occur particularly at the margins of the prostate. Correcting the baseline by removing lipid artifacts is, therefore, a necessary processing step. We propose a simple baseline correction method for prostate magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging through subtraction of a single simulated-lorentzian resonance.

The histology-pathology and copy number profiles were remarkably homogeneous, yet it was possible to propose the quadrant of the prostate tumour that likely seeded the metastatic diaspora. Despite a homogeneous cell type, our transcriptome analysis revealed signatures of both luminal and neuroendocrine cell types. Remarkably, the repertoire of expressed but apparently private gene fusions, including C15orf21:MYC, recapitulated this biology.

Methods:   Data sources included cancer incidence (Georgia Comprehensive Cancer Registry), cancer mortality (Georgia Vital Records), and health factor (County Health Rankings) data. Age-adjusted incidence and mortality rates were calculated by cancer site (all sites combined, lung, colorectal, prostate, breast, oral, and cervical) for 2003-2007. MIRs and 95% confidence intervals were calculated overall and by district for each cancer site, race, and sex. MIRs were mapped by district and compared with geographic health factors.  Results:   In total, 186,419 incident cases and 71,533 deaths were identified. Blacks had higher MIRs than whites for every cancer site evaluated, and especially large differentials were observed for prostate, cervical, and oral cancer in men. Large geographic disparities were detected, with larger MIRs, chiefly among blacks, in Georgia compared with national data. The highest MIRs were detected in west and east central Georgia, and the lowest MIRs were detected in and around Atlanta. Districts with better health behavior, clinical care, and social/economic factors had lower MIRs, especially among whites.  Conclusions:   More fatal cancers, particularly prostate, cervical, and oral cancer in men were detected among blacks, especially in central Georgia, where health behavior and social/economic factors were worse.

The purpose of this study was to investigate whether HOXB13 could be used as a molecular marker to predict prostate cancer recurrence.

There was no significant correlation between the expression of HOXB13 and most clinical/pathological parameters, including tumor margin, invasion, pathological stage and risk level. The HOXB13 expression levels correlated with the Gleason score and there was a positive correlation with the pre-operative prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels. Accordingly, the tumor specimens from 4 patients who ultimately had biochemical failure (PSA >0.2 ng/ml), all showed a high expression of HOXB13, while their risk levels were either intermediate or high.

Materials and methods:   Bone scans with 99mTc-methylene diphosphonate were performed in 144 patients with pathologically proven prostate cancer, and distribution regularity of metastatic bony lesions was analyzed retrospectively.  Results:   A total of 2000 lesions of bone metastasis were detected in 102 patients, 28.9% of which were distributed in the ribs, 14.8% in thoracic vertebrae, 13.8% in the ilium, and 8.0% in the lumbar vertebrae. The distribution of metastatic bony lesions was correlated with the total number of lesions. The proportion of metastatic lesions of vertebrae and pelvis was up to 84.5% (49/58) in fewer bone metastases. The proportion gradually decreased with an increase in the total number of lesions, but the proportion of the bony lesions, except for the vertebrae and pelvis, gradually increased with an increase in the total number of lesions. Ninety-nine percent (903/912) of metastatic bony lesions, except for the vertebrae and pelvis, coexisted with metastasis of vertebrae or pelvis, whereas only 1.0% (9/912) of those were detected in no metastasis of the vertebrae and pelvis; their difference was significant (χ2=876.4, P=0.000).

As our constraint failed to prevent grade 2 or 3 rectal bleeding (bled-pts) in 5.1% of patients, we retrospectively explored another constraint for the prevention of rectal bleeding.  Materials and methods:   The study population consisted of 197 patients treated with the brachytherapy as monotherapy using real-time intraoperative transrectal ultrasound (US)-guided treatment at a prescribed dose of 145 Gy. Post-implant dosimetry was performed on Day 1 and Day 30 after implantation using computed tomography (CT) imaging. Rectal bleeding toxicity was classified by CTC-AE ver. 3.0 during a mean 29-month (range, 12-48 months) period after implantation. The differences in rV100s were compared among intraoperative, Day 1 and Day 30 dosimetry, and between that of patients with grade 2 or 3 rectal bleeding (the bled-pts) and of the others (the spared-pts). All patients were divided into groups based on provisional rV100s that were increased stepwise in 0.1-cc increments from 0 to 1.0 cc. The difference in the ratios of the bled-pts to the spared-pts was tested by chi-square tests, and their odds ratios were calculated (bled-OR). All statistical analyses were performed by t-tests.  Results:   The mean values of rV100us, rV100CT_1, and rV100CT_30 were 0.31 ± 0.43, 0.22 ± 0.36, and 0.59 ± 0.68 cc, respectively. These values temporarily decreased (p = 0.020) on Day 1 and increased (p = 0.000) on Day 30. There was no significant difference in rV100s between the bled-pts and spared-pts at any time of dosimetry. The maximum bled-OR was identified among patients with an rV100us value above 0.1 cc (p = 0.025; OR = 7.8; 95% CI, 1.4-145.8); an rV100CT_1 value above 0.3 cc (p = 0.014; OR = 16.2; 95% CI, 3.9-110.7), and an rV100CT_30 value above 0.5 cc (p = 0.019; OR = 6.3; 95% CI, 1.5-42.3).

Aim:   To assess interobserver reproducibility of Gleason grading of prostatic adenocarcinoma.  Design:   A total of 20 cases of prostatic adenocarcinoma were scored using Gleason grade by 21 general pathologists. The scores were then compared using κ-coefficient and consensus score.  Results:   For Gleason score groups (2-4, 5-6, 7 and 8-10) overall agreement with consensus score was 68%. Exact agreement for Gleason scores with consensus score was 43.3% and 92.3% within ±1 of the consensus score. κ coefficient for primary grade ranged from -0.32 to 0.92 with 60% of the readings in fair to moderate agreement range; and for secondary grade κ ranged from -0.30 to 0.62 with 78% of the readings in slight to fair agreement range.

Despite intensive investigations, molecular mechanisms underlying metastasis are not completely understood. Among prostate cancer-derived factors, parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP), first discovered as an etiologic factor for malignancy-induced hypercalcemia, regulates many cellular functions critical to tumor growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis. In this study, the role of PTHrP in tumor cell survival from detachment-induced apoptosis (i.e. anoikis) was investigated. Reduction of PTHLH (encoding PTHrP) gene expression in human prostate cancer cells (PC-3) increased the percentage of apoptotic cells when cultured in suspension. Conversely, overexpression of PTHrP protected prostate cancer cells (Ace-1 and LNCaP, both typically expressing low or undetectable basal PTHrP) from anoikis. Overexpression of nuclear localization signal (NLS)-defective PTHrP failed to protect cells from anoikis, suggesting that PTHrP-dependent protection from anoikis is an intracrine event. A PCR-based apoptosis-related gene array showed that detachment increased expression of the TNF gene (encoding the proapoptotic protein tumor necrosis factor-α) fourfold greater in PTHrP-knockdown PC-3 cells than in control PC-3 cells. In parallel, TNF gene expression was significantly reduced in PTHrP-overexpressing LNCaP cells, but not in NLS-defective PTHrP overexpressing LNCaP cells, when compared with control LNCaP cells. Subsequently, in a prostate cancer skeletal metastasis mouse model, PTHrP-knockdown PC-3 cells resulted in significantly fewer metastatic lesions compared to control PC-3 cells, suggesting that PTHrP mediated antianoikis events in the bloodstream. In conclusion, nuclear localization of PTHrP confers prostate cancer cell resistance to anoikis, potentially contributing to prostate cancer metastasis.""","""['Serk In Park', 'Laurie K McCauley']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Endocr Relat Cancer""","""['Parathyroid hormone-related protein upregulates integrin expression via an intracrine pathway in PC-3 prostate cancer cells.', 'EB1089 inhibits the parathyroid hormone-related protein-enhanced bone metastasis and xenograft growth of human prostate cancer cells.', 'Parathyroid hormone related-protein promotes epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in prostate cancer.', 'The multifaceted actions of PTHrP in skeletal metastasis.', 'Prostate secretory protein of 94 amino acids (PSP-94) and its peptide (PCK3145) as potential therapeutic modalities for prostate cancer.', 'Parathyroid hormone-related peptide and parathyroid hormone-related peptide receptor type 1 in locally advanced laryngeal cancer as prognostic indicators of relapse and survival.', 'PTHLH Predicts the Prognosis of Patients with Oral Leukoplakia.', 'Interaction between Tumor-Associated Dendritic Cells and Colon Cancer Cells Contributes to Tumor Progression via CXCL1.', 'Survival analysis of multiple peptide vaccination for the selection of correlated peptides in urological cancers.', 'Fatty Acids and Calcium Regulation in Prostate Cancer.']"""

We evaluated whether TβRII loss also affected prostate cancer bone metastatic growth. Immunohistologic analysis revealed that TβRII expression was lost in cancer-associated fibroblasts in human prostate cancer bone metastatic tissues. We recapitulated the human situation with a conditional stromal Tgfbr2 knockout (Tgfbr2-KO) mouse model. Conditioned media from primary cultured Tgfbr2-KO or control Tgfbr2-flox prostatic fibroblasts (koPFCM or wtPFCM, respectively) were applied to C4-2B prostate cancer cells before grafting the cells tibially. We found that koPFCM promoted prostate cancer cell growth in the bone and development of early mixed osteoblastic/osteolytic bone lesions. Furthermore, the koPFCM promoted greater C4-2B adhesion to type-I collagen, the major component of bone matrix, compared to wtPFCM-treated C4-2B. Cytokine antibody array analysis revealed that koPFCM had more than two-fold elevation in granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and CXCL1, CXCL16, and CXCL5 expression relative to wtPFCM. Interestingly, neutralizing antibodies of CXCL16 or CXCL1 were able to reduce koPFCM-associated C4-2B type-I collagen adhesion to that comparable with wtPFCM-mediated adhesion. Collectively, our data indicate that loss of TGF-β responsiveness in prostatic fibroblasts results in upregulation of CXCL16 and CXCL1 and that these paracrine signals increase prostate cancer cell adhesion in the bone matrix.

We surmised that by targeting MTZ to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), we may not only alter its toxicity profile, but also enhance its potency in EGFR-overexpressing tumors. To test this hypothesis, we designed JDF12, studied its mechanism of action in human prostate cancer (PCa) cells and determined its potency in vivo.  Experimental design:   To analyze its mixed EGFR-DNA targeting potential, we performed an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and western blotting analysis of EGFR phosphorylation in cells stimulated with EGF. DNA damage was analyzed using the comet assay, and apoptosis quantitated by annexin V binding assay. Growth inhibition in vitro was determined by the sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay and in vivo efficacy analyzed in male CD-1 nude mice.  Results:   The results showed that: Under physiological conditions, JDF12 was hydrolyzed to JDF04R and both agents were capable of inhibiting isolated EGFR tyrosine kinase (TK) and EGFR phosphorylation in EGF-stimulated cells.

The function or regulation of GPNMB in the human prostate remains unknown.  Methods:   The expression of GPNMB in prostate carcinoma cells were determined by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and immunoblot assays. Effects of ectopic GPNMB overexpression on cell proliferation, invasion, and tumorigenesis were determined by (3) H-thymidine incorporation, matrigel invasion, soft agar cloning assays, and murine xenograft study. Effects of GPNMB, p53, and androgen on target gene were assessed using RT-PCR, immunoblotting, and transient gene expression assays.  Results:   In vitro analysis using several prostate cell lines suggested that expression of GPNMB may be relevant to the extent of neoplasia. Ectopic overexpression of GPNMB significantly attenuated cell proliferation and invasion and exerted antitumorigenic activity on PC-3 cells in vitro and in vivo. GPNMB overexpression induced the gene expressions of N-myc downstream regulated gene 1 (Ndrg1) and maspin in PC-3 cells. Doxorubicin treatment or transient overexpression of p53 increased GPNMB expression. Androgen (R1881) treatment has a divergent effect on gene expression of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and GPNMB in LNCaP cells. Androgen treatment enhanced cell proliferation but downregulated GPNMB protein expression in stably overexpressed androgen receptor (AR) CA-HPV-10 cells.  Conclusions:   Together these results suggest that GPNMB gene is a p53- and androgen-dysregulated gene and should be regarded as an anti-tumor gene for prostate cancer. The enhancement of Ndrg1 and maspin gene expressions may account for the anti-proliferative and anti-invasive function of GPNMB in PC-3 cells.""","""['Ke-Hung Tsui', 'Ying-Ling Chang', 'Tsui-Hsia Feng', 'Phei-Lang Chang', 'Horng-Heng Juang']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Metallothionein 3: an androgen-upregulated gene enhances cell invasion and tumorigenesis of prostate carcinoma cells.', 'Growth differentiation factor-15 upregulates interleukin-6 to promote tumorigenesis of prostate carcinoma PC-3 cells.', 'Upregulation of prostate-derived Ets factor by luteolin causes inhibition of cell proliferation and cell invasion in prostate carcinoma cells.', 'Glycoprotein Non-Metastatic Melanoma Protein B (GPNMB) and Cancer: A Novel Potential Therapeutic Target.', 'The role of NDRG1 in the pathology and potential treatment of human cancers.', ""Inflammation in the CNS: Understanding Various Aspects of the Pathogenesis of Alzheimer's Disease."", 'Anti-inflammatory role of Gpnmb in adipose tissue of mice.', 'The role of N-cadherin/c-Jun/NDRG1 axis in the progression of prostate cancer.', ""The Association Analysis of GPNMB rs156429 With Clinical Manifestations in Chinese Population With Parkinson's Disease."", 'Prognostic values of GPNMB identified by mining TCGA database and STAD microenvironment.']"""

Methods:   We categorized 2675 men with prostate cancer treated at MD Anderson Cancer Center with definitive external beam radiation therapy with or without androgen deprivation therapy into 3 treatment eras: 1987 to 1993 (n = 722), 1994 to 1999 (n = 828), and 2000 to 2007 (n = 1125). To help adjust for stage migration, patients were stratified according to risk group as defined by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network. Biochemical (Phoenix definition), local, distant, and any clinical failure, prostate-cancer specific survival, and overall survival were analyzed according to the Kaplan-Meier method.  Results:   Median age was 68.5 years and median follow-up was 6.4 years. Fewer men in the most recent era had high-risk disease, and a higher proportion received 72 Gy or higher (99% vs 4%) and androgen deprivation therapy (60% vs 6%) than the earliest era. All risk groups treated in the modern era experienced improved rates of biochemical, local, and distant failure. In high-risk patients, decreased rates of distant failure and clinical failure led to improved prostate cancer-specific survival and overall survival. Local control was improved for intermediate- and high-risk patients, with a trend toward improvement in low-risk patients. On multivariate analysis, recent treatment era was closely correlated with a dose of 72 Gy or higher and treatment with androgen deprivation therapy and predicted for lower rates of biochemical, local, and distant failure. Androgen deprivation therapy, higher dose, and more recent treatment era predicted for improved prostate cancer-specific survival.  Discussion:   During the last 20 years of prostate cancer irradiation, disease control outcomes have improved in all patients, leading to improved prostate cancer-specific survival and overall survival for men with high-risk disease. This may reflect advances in workup, staging accuracy, and prostate cancer treatment in the modern era.""","""['Michelle M Kim', 'Karen E Hoffman', 'Lawrence B Levy', 'Steven J Frank', 'Thomas J Pugh', 'Seungtaek Choi', 'Quynh N Nguyen', 'Sean E McGuire', 'Andrew K Lee', 'Deborah A Kuban']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Cancer J""","""['Improvement in prostate cancer survival over time: a 20-year analysis: the Will Rogers phenomenon returns.', 'Excellent results from high dose rate brachytherapy and external beam for prostate cancer are not improved by androgen deprivation.', 'Year of treatment as independent predictor of relapse-free survival in patients with localized prostate cancer treated with definitive radiotherapy in the PSA era.', 'Lack of benefit from a short course of androgen deprivation for unfavorable prostate cancer patients treated with an accelerated hypofractionated regime.', 'Dose escalated external beam radiotherapy versus neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy and conventional dose external beam radiotherapy for clinically localized prostate cancer: do we need both?', 'Short-term androgen deprivation therapy for patients with intermediate-risk prostate cancer undergoing dose-escalated radiotherapy: the standard of care?', 'Comparison of satisfaction with penile prosthesis implantation in patients with prostate cancer radiation therapy versus radical prostatectomy.', 'Integrating CT-based radiomic model with clinical features improves long-term prognostication in high-risk prostate cancer.', 'A Humanized Monoclonal Antibody Targeting Extracellular Nicotinamide Phosphoribosyltransferase Prevents Aggressive Prostate Cancer Progression.', 'Induction of Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress-Mediated Apoptosis by Aminosteroid RM-581 Efficiently Blocks the Growth of PC-3 Cancer Cells and Tumors Resistant or Not to Docetaxel.', 'Role of secreted extracellular nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (eNAMPT) in prostate cancer progression: Novel biomarker and therapeutic target.']"""

Its aberrant expression and elevated activity have been linked to many human cancers, including prostate cancer. As an effort to develop new chemotherapy for prostate cancers, in this study, we tested the effects of tetra-bromo-cinnamic acid (TBCA), a newly synthetic CK2-selective CK2 inhibitor, on androgen receptor (AR) transactivation, cell proliferation, and viability in multiple prostate cancer cell lines.  Methods:   We utilized a comprehensive approach of a newly synthetic CK2-selective inhibitor TBCA, plus gene-specific siRNAs in multiple cell-based assays to further understand the role of CK2 in AR signaling. Alamar-blue-based cell growth assay, flow cytometry for cell cycle distribution, Luciferase report gene assay for AR transactivation, and immuno-fluorescent approach for AR nuclear localization as well as quantitative PCR assay for AR-mediated gene expression were utilized. The significance of the differences between treatment and control was analyzed using the SPSS software (SPSS, Chicago, IL).  Results:   Our data revealed that TBCA reduced cell proliferation and caused G2/M cell cycle arrest in a dose-dependent manner. Further analysis demonstrated that TBCA blocked AR nuclear translocation and gene expression. To confirm the target specificity, we used gene-specific siRNAs for both CK2α and CK2α' subunits, and the results suggested that both CK2 catalytic subunits are involved in androgen-stimulated AR nuclear translocation and AR-mediated gene expression in prostate cancer cells.  Conclusions:   CK2 subunits α and α' are likely involved in AR signaling, and TBCA might be useful in the management of prostate cancers as a chemo-preventive agent in the future.""","""['Kai Yao', 'Hyewon Youn', 'Xiaoyan Gao', 'Bijun Huang', 'Fangjian Zhou', 'Benyi Li', 'Hui Han']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Both CK2 catalytic subunits involves in androgen receptor signaling in prostate cancer cells.', 'Inhibition of protein kinase CK2 leads to a modulation of androgen receptor dependent transcription in prostate cancer cells.', 'GCP-mediated growth inhibition and apoptosis of prostate cancer cells via androgen receptor-dependent and -independent mechanisms.', 'Protein kinase CK2 inhibitors: a patent review.', 'Casein Kinase II (CK2) as a Therapeutic Target for Hematological Malignancies.', 'Protein kinase CK2 - diverse roles in cancer cell biology and therapeutic promise.', 'Mechanisms of Resistance to Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen-Targeted Radioligand Therapy in a Mouse Model of Prostate Cancer.', 'CK2 Pro-Survival Role in Prostate Cancer Is Mediated via Maintenance and Promotion of Androgen Receptor and NFκB p65 Expression.', 'Protein Kinase CK2, a Potential Therapeutic Target in Carcinoma Management.', 'Design, synthesis, and evaluation of 4,5,6,7-tetrahydrobenzodthiazole-based novel dual kinase inhibitors of CK2 and GSK3β.']"""

The process of oncogenic transformation leads to enhanced DNA damage and activates the checkpoint network that functions as an inducible barrier against cancer progression. Here, we analyzed the effects of testosterone on the DNA damage response in prostate cancer cells to assess whether testosterone functions a barrier to cancer progression under the oxidative stress.  Methods:   We examined the effects of testosterone on components of the DNA damage response pathway, including ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated kinase), H2AX (histone H2AX variant), and Chk2 (checkpoint kinase2) in prostate cancer cell lines, treated with various concentration of hydrogen peroxide (H(2) O(2) ). Cellular apoptosis was quantified by poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage and flow cytometry.  Results:   H(2) O(2) induced apoptosis and phosphorylation of ATM, Chk2, and H2AX in LNCaP cells. An ATM inhibitor, Ku55933, reduced H(2) O(2) -induced apoptosis in LNCaP and 22Rv1 cells. Androgen treatments increased H(2) O(2) -induced activation of the DNA damage response and PARP cleavage, but not when the H(2) O(2) -treated cells were also treated with the anti-androgen flutamide. The ATM inhibitor Ku55933 inhibited androgen-induced phosphorylation of ATM and PARP cleavage.

This increased incidence has led to overtreatment of many patients, as current pathology often cannot distinguish latent from aggressive PCa. Studies have shown that the depletion of zinc in prostate cells correlated with cell-line growth rates, and may therefore relate to the progression of PCa. Furthermore, as zinc is normally an inhibitor of citrate oxidation, the reduction of zinc in PCa may cause a decrease in citrate secretion levels in the glandular epithelia of PCa patients.  Methods:   Using high-resolution magic angle spinning proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy followed by quantitative histopathology, we investigate unit histo-benign prostate epithelial citrate concentrations in intact tissue samples obtained from 18 patients with pre-surgical PSA values less than 20 ng/ml. Using these data, we evaluate correlations between citrate concentrations and PSA velocities, densities and blood percent-free PSA.  Results:   We observe different linear patterns between citrate concentrations and histo-benign glandular epithelia from patients of different PSA velocities. More importantly, we obtain a significant correlation between PSA velocity, density and percent-free PSA, and citrate concentrations in unit volume of histo-benign epithelial glands of the peripheral zone.  Conclusions:   Low levels of citrate in unit volume represent rapidly increasing PSA values, and, therefore, may be used as an indicator of fast-growing PCa. Thus, tissue samples obtained at the time of biopsy may be evaluated for their citrate concentrations for the prediction of PCa growth rates, allowing for the implementation of alternative treatment options and reducing overtreatment.""","""['R Dittrich', 'J Kurth', 'E A Decelle', 'E M DeFeo', 'M Taupitz', 'S Wu', 'C-L Wu', 'W S McDougal', 'L L Cheng']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['Prostate cancer: Biopsy citrate concentration could predict prostate cancer growth rate.', 'Seminal citrate is superior to PSA for detecting clinically significant prostate cancer.', 'Magnetic resonance spectroscopy in patients with locally confined prostate cancer: association of prostatic citrate and metabolic atrophy with time on hormone deprivation therapy, PSA level, and biopsy Gleason score.', 'More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'The role of molecular forms of prostate-specific antigen (PSA or hK3) and of human glandular kallikrein 2 (hK2) in the diagnosis and monitoring of prostate cancer and in extra-prostatic disease.', 'High-resolution magic angle spinning 1H MRS in prostate cancer.', 'Ex Vivo High-Resolution Magic Angle Spinning (HRMAS) 1H NMR Spectroscopy for Early Prostate Cancer Detection.', 'Role of Altered Metabolic Microenvironment in Osteolytic Metastasis.', 'Dual-Surfactant-Capped Ag Nanoparticles as a Highly Selective and Sensitive Colorimetric Sensor for Citrate Detection.', 'Seminal citrate is superior to PSA for detecting clinically significant prostate cancer.', 'Vitamin D regulates prostate cell metabolism via genomic and non-genomic mitochondrial redox-dependent mechanisms.']"""

Methods:   Men enrolled in a state-funded program, providing free prostate cancer treatment for underserved men, were recruited, if they had received at least 3 months of continuous ADT and/or other forms of primary treatment. HRQOL was assessed with validated measures including the RAND Medical Outcomes Study 12-item Health Short Form Survey (SF-12), the UCLA Prostate Cancer Index Survey and the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite Survey. Repeated measures analysis was performed to evaluate the association between clinical and sociodemographic covariates with HRQOL.  Results:   We enrolled 322 men, including 94 on ADT and 228 who received other forms of treatment. When controlling for patient characteristics, men receiving ADT had poorer outcomes relative to sexual function (P<0.01), sexual bother (P<0.01), hormonal function (P<0.01) and hormonal bother (P=0.02). ADT use was significantly associated with worsening sexual function (P<0.01) and sexual bother (P=0.01) over two years compared with non-ADT users.

ADT users had better urinary function and less bother than non-ADT users among the Other group, while the opposite was true for whites and Hispanics. For hormonal bother, ADT use was associated with worse outcomes across all three race/ethnicity groups; however, Hispanics were less bothered by their hormonal symptoms than whites or Others.

Finasteride (Proscar) and dutasteride (Avodart) are 5-α reductase inhibitors (5-ARIs) used to treat LUTS in men with benign prostatic enlargement. Because these drugs suppress androgens, the theory has been put forward that 5-ARIs might prevent the development of prostate cancer. Careful analysis of two randomized controlled trials, however, showed that, in the clinical setting, this was not the case, and that these drugs can increase the occurrence of more aggressive high-grade disease. Because of this, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration did not approve 5-ARIs for the primary prevention of prostate cancer and notified healthcare professionals about a change in the 'Warnings and Precautions' for these drugs. Interest remains among some for using 5-ARIs in men diagnosed with very low-risk prostate cancer to delay the progression from clinically indolent disease to clinically significant disease requiring treatment. The present study investigated whether 5-ARI use among men with very low-risk prostate cancer in an active surveillance (AS) programme would reduce the number of cancers reclassified to clinically significant disease on surveillance biopsy. Our results do not support the use of 5-ARIs for slowing or preventing cancer progression in men with low-risk prostate cancer, but do suggest that men with very low-risk prostate cancer who take 5-ARIs for LUTS are unlikely to be at increased risk for the development of high grade disease during AS.  Objective:   To determine whether 5-α reductase inhibitor (5-ARI) use delays cancer reclassification in an active surveillance (AS) cohort.  Patients and methods:   We performed a retrospective study of 587 men enrolled in an AS programme, who had no history of 5-ARI use. Chi-squared and t-tests were used to compare characteristics of 5-ARI users and non-users. Univariable and multivariable proportional hazards models, treating 5-ARI use as a time-dependent covariate, were used to evaluate the influence of 5-ARIs on the risk of a subsequent biopsy no longer meeting criteria for continued AS (i.e. reclassification).  Results:   5-ARI use was initiated in 47 men while on AS. Men using 5-ARIs had larger prostates and higher PSA levels at diagnosis. During 5-ARI use, PSA levels and prostate volume deceased by mean values of 47% and 11%, respectively. Men using 5-ARIs had a mean of 2.5 surveillance biopsies while on the drug.

Level of Evidence 3a. What's known on the subject? and What does the study add? Treatment of advanced PC might put patients at an increased risk of cardiovascular events. Recent studies have suggested that the excess mortality is lower among men who were diagnosed with screen detected PC in comparison to men with clinically diagnosed PC, possibly due to the use of medications for cardiovascular disease and the change to a healthier lifestyle of men with a screen detected PC. Men with clinically diagnosed PC have an increased risk of death unrelated to PC itself, i.e., the excess mortality is based on an increased risk of dying from other neoplasm and diseases of the circulatory or respiratory system.  Objective:   • To assess the cause-specific mortality unrelated to prostate cancer (PC) itself in patients with screen- and clinically diagnosed PC.  Patients and methods:   • The present study was conducted among participants of the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer. • Based on consensus of the causes of death committee (CODC), all patients who died from PC were excluded. • In the intervention arm, cases were patients with a screen-detected PC, aged 55-74 years, between 1993 and 2001. • These cases were matched to two controls in whom no cancer was found after biopsy, and two controls in whom no cancer was suspected after screening. In the control arm, cases were patients with clinically diagnosed PC, aged 55-74 years, between 1993 and 2001. These cases were matched to four controls without PC. Matching was done with respect to date of birth, screening and/or diagnosis. Men were followed up to 31 December 2007.  Results:   • No statistically significant difference in overall mortality between cases and controls in the intervention arm was observed: relative risk (RR) 1.26 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.96-1.65; P = 0.102) and RR 1.13 (95% CI 0.86-1.47; P = 0.381). • In the control arm, the overall mortality was statistically significantly higher in cases relative to controls: RR 1.43 (95% CI 1.03-2.00; P = 0.033). • This difference was because of an increased risk of dying from neoplasms and disease of the circulatory or respiratory system among cases: RR 1.61 (95% CI 1.12-2.29; P = 0.009). • The present study was limited by the relatively small sample size.  Conclusions:   • Increased mortality unrelated to PC itself was observed in men with clinically diagnosed PC, but not in screen-detected PC. • The excess mortality in men with clinically diagnosed PC seems to be as a result of a significantly increased risk of dying from neoplasm and disease of the circulatory or respiratory system. • Results have to be studied more thoroughly in further clinical trials.""","""['Pim J van Leeuwen', 'Suzie J Otto', 'Ries Kranse', 'Monique J Roobol', 'Meelan Bul', 'Xiaoye Zhu', 'Harry de Koning', 'Fritz H Schröder']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Disease-specific survival of men with prostate cancer detected during the screening interval: results of the European randomized study of screening for prostate cancer-Rotterdam after 11 years of follow-up.', 'Towards an optimal interval for prostate cancer screening.', 'Long-term radical prostatectomy outcomes among participants from the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) Rotterdam.', 'Global update on defining and treating high-risk localized prostate cancer with leuprorelin: a USA perspective--identifying men at diagnosis who are at high risk of prostate cancer death after surgery or radiation therapy.', 'Detection of prostate cancer: the impact of the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC).', 'Assessing the nutritional needs of men with prostate cancer.']"""

The author has studied whether imaging fusion can be used to select a targeted needle biopsy (NB) portion if the development of recurrent prostate cancer (PC) is suspected after radical prostatectomy (RP). MRI-TRUS fusion was performed in 11 patients in different periods after RP. All the patients underwent dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI and then MRI-TRUS fusion during TRUS studies (TRUSS). MRI-TRUS fusion-guided NBs of suspected portions in the vesicourethral anastomotic area were carried out in 7 patients. A control group comprised 18 patients, of whom 12 patients underwent isolated TRUS-guided NB. The use of the fusion technology was shown to make a simultaneous assessment of the MRI and TRUS images of a vesicourethral anastomotic area in post-RP patients. At the same time, the high accuracy of comparison of MRI and TRUS images ensures the steady position of portions with early intensive accumulation of a MRI contrast agent during real-time TRUSS. Thus, morphologically relevant materials could be obtained in 6 of the 7 patients in the MRI-TRUS-guided NB group and only in 3 of the 12 control patients. Therefore, the use of MRI-TRUS fusion enhances the efficiency of NB in post-RP patients suspected of having recurrent PC. The criterion for selecting a target portion is the abnormal accumulation of a MRI contrast agent.""","""['V V Kapustin']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Vestn Rentgenol Radiol""","""['Localising prostate cancer: comparison of endorectal magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and 3D-MR spectroscopic imaging with transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy.', 'Magnetic resonance imaging-transectal ultrasound image-fusion biopsies accurately characterize the index tumor: correlation with step-sectioned radical prostatectomy specimens in 135 patients.', 'Targeted MRI-guided prostate biopsies for the detection of prostate cancer: initial clinical experience with real-time 3-dimensional transrectal ultrasound guidance and magnetic resonance/transrectal ultrasound image fusion.', 'MR imaging-guided prostate biopsy techniques.', 'Role of MRI in follow-up after focal therapy for prostate carcinoma.']"""

Breast, bladder and prostate cancers showed the highest rate of identification, whereas bone, liver and pancreatic cancers showed the lowest rate of identification. CR had no records on 10.6% of cancer cases recorded in DR. Similarly, the identification rate in HDR was 84.5% for concordant cancer and with 9.6% of cases missing. Neither source reported cancers for 3.4% of cancer cases recorded in DR. In conclusion, some 10% of cancer deaths had no cancer records in CR or in HDR, and 3.4% were missing in both sources.

Novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of CRPC are needed. Antagonists of hypothalamic growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) inhibit growth of various malignancies, including androgen-dependent and independent prostate cancer, by suppressing diverse tumoral growth factors, especially GHRH itself, which acts as a potent autocrine/paracrine growth factor in many tumors. We evaluated the effects of the GHRH antagonist, JMR-132, on PC-3 human androgen-independent prostate cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. JMR-132 suppressed the proliferation of PC-3 cells in vitro in a dose-dependent manner and significantly inhibited growth of PC-3 tumors by 61% (P < 0.05). The expression of GHRH, GHRH receptors, and their main splice variant, SV1, in PC-3 cells and tumor xenografts was demonstrated by RT-PCR and Western blot. The content of GHRH protein in PC-3 xenografts was lowered markedly, by 66.3% (P < 0.01), after treatment with JMR-132. GHRH induced a significant increase in levels of ERK, but JMR-132 abolished this outcome. Our findings indicate that inhibition of PC-3 prostate cancer by JMR-132 involves inactivation of Akt and ERK. The inhibitory effect produced by GHRH antagonist can result in part from inactivation of the PI3K/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin and Raf/MEK/ERK pathways and from the reduction in GHRH produced by cancer cells. Our findings support the role of GHRH as an autocrine growth factor in prostate cancer and suggest that antagonists of GHRH should be considered for further development as therapy for CRPC.""","""['Ferenc G Rick', 'Andrew V Schally', 'Luca Szalontay', 'Norman L Block', 'Karoly Szepeshazi', 'Mehrdad Nadji', 'Marta Zarandi', 'Florian Hohla', 'Stefan Buchholz', 'Stephan Seitz']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A""","""['Prostate cancer: GHRH antagonists could be effective in CRPC treatment.', 'Inhibitory effects of antagonists of growth hormone-releasing hormone on growth and invasiveness of PC3 human prostate cancer.', 'Antagonists of growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) reduce prostate size in experimental benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'Antiproliferative effect of growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) antagonist on ovarian cancer cells through the EGFR-Akt pathway.', 'Endocrine and antineoplastic actions of growth hormone-releasing hormone antagonists.', 'Antagonists of growth-hormone-releasing hormone: an emerging new therapy for cancer.', 'Growth Hormone-Releasing Hormone in Endothelial Inflammation.', 'Antagonist of Growth Hormone-Releasing Hormone Potentiates the Antitumor Effect of Pemetrexed and Cisplatin in Pleural Mesothelioma.', 'Interferon regulatory factor 1-triggered free ubiquitin protects the intestines against radiation-induced injury via CXCR4/FGF2 signaling.', 'Tumorigenic transformation of human prostatic epithelial cell line RWPE-1 by growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH).', 'Constitutive signal bias mediated by the human GHRHR splice variant 1.']"""

PC is the most common solid neoplasm (214 cases per 1000 men) and the second most common cause of cancer death in men. Its management involves several complex issues for both clinicians and patients. An early diagnosis is necessary to implement well-balanced therapeutic options, and the correct evaluation can reduce the risk of overtreatment with its consequential adverse effects. Breast and Prostate cancers, respectively, are the most common cancers in women and in men, and different similarities have been underlined. The paradigm of the patient consulting a multidisciplinary medical team has been an established standard approach in treating breast cancer. Such multidisciplinary approach can offer the same optional care for men with PC as it does for women with breast cancer. A multidisciplinary team (MDT) comprises healthcare professionals from different disciplines whose goal of providing optimal patient care is achieved through coordination and communication with one another. A Prostate Cancer Unit is a place where men can be cared for by specialists in PC, working together within a multi-professional team. The MTD approach guarantees a higher probability for the PC patient to receive adequate information on the disease and on all possible therapeutic strategies, balancing advantages and related side effects.

We previously showed that the synthetic organoselenium compound, p-XSC, effectively inhibits viability and critical signaling molecules (e.g., androgen receptor, Akt) in androgen responsive (AR) and androgen independent (AI) human prostate cancer cells. On the basis of its inhibition of Akt, we hypothesized that p-XSC modulates mTORC2, an upstream regulator of the kinase. We further hypothesized that combining p-XSC with rapamycin, an mTORC1 inhibitor, would be an effective combinatory strategy for the inhibition of prostate cancer. The effects of p-XSC and rapamycin, alone or in combination, on viability and mTOR signaling were examined in AR LNCaP prostate cancer cells and AI C4-2 and DU145 cells. Phosphorylation of downstream targets of mTORC1 and mTORC2 was analyzed by immunoblotting. The interaction of mTORC1- and mTORC2-specific proteins with mTOR was probed through immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting. p-XSC inhibited phosphorylation of mTORC2 downstream targets, Akt and PCKα, and decreased the levels of rictor, an mTORC2-specific protein, coimmunoprecipitated with mTOR in C4-2 cells.

Methods:   Sixty-four patients who met the Epstein criteria for clinically insignificant prostate cancer underwent TTMB. Each biopsy core position was recorded in 3 dimensions with documentation of location of each positive biopsy core, Gleason score, percentage of involvement of each core, and presence/absence of perineural invasion.

We hypothesized that sorafenib inhibits UGT1A1 and individuals carrying UGT1A1*28 and/or UGT1A9 variants experience greater sorafenib exposure and greater increase in sorafenib-induced plasma bilirubin concentration.  Experimental design:   Inhibition of UGT1A1-mediated bilirubin glucuronidation by sorafenib was assessed in vitro. UGT1A1*28 and UGT1A9*3 genotypes were ascertained with fragment analysis or direct sequencing in 120 cancer patients receiving sorafenib on five different clinical trials. Total bilirubin measurements were collected in prostate cancer patients before receiving sorafenib (n = 41) and 19 to 30 days following treatment and were compared with UGT1A1*28 genotype.  Results:   Sorafenib exhibited mixed-mode inhibition of UGT1A1-mediated bilirubin glucuronidation (IC(50) = 18 μmol/L; K(i) = 11.7 μmol/L) in vitro. Five patients carrying UGT1A1*28/*28 (n = 4) or UGT1A9*3/*3 (n = 1) genotypes had first dose, dose-normalized areas under the sorafenib plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) that were in the 93rd percentile, whereas three patients carrying UGT1A1*28/*28 had AUCs in the bottom quartile of all genotyped patients. The Drug Metabolizing Enzymes and Transporters genotyping platform was applied to DNA obtained from six patients, which revealed the ABCC2-24C>T genotype cosegregated with sorafenib AUC phenotype. Sorafenib exposure was related to plasma bilirubin increases in patients carrying 1 or 2 copies of UGT1A1*28 alleles (n = 12 and n = 5; R(2) = 0.38 and R(2) = 0.77; P = 0.032 and P = 0.051, respectively). UGT1A1*28 carriers showed two distinct phenotypes that could be explained by ABCC2-24C>T genotype and are more likely to experience plasma bilirubin increases following sorafenib if they had high sorafenib exposure.

The ETS-1 gene encodes three distinct proteins, ETS-1 p51 encoded by a full-length mRNA, ETS-1 p42 and ETS-1 p27 encoded by an alternatively spliced mRNA lacking exon VII and exons III-VI, respectively. ETS-1 p51, commonly considered to be the active form, has been studied in prostate cancer (PCa). However, the ETS-1 p42 and p27 variants have not yet been identified in PCa. Therefore, we aimed in this study at investigating whether the splice variants p42 and p27 are expressed in the androgen-dependent VCaP and LNCaP and the androgen-independent PC3 and DU-145 PCa cell lines. Using RT-PCR, we found the expression of both splice variants p42 and p27 at the mRNA level in the VCaP, LNCaP, PC3 and DU-145 PCa cell lines. We then confirmed the expression of ETS-1 p51 and its splice variants p42 and p27 at the protein level using an anti-ETS-1 antibody directed against the DNA-binding domain (DBD) in lysates prepared from the latter-mentioned cell lines, as well as in PC3 cell nuclear extract. Moreover, differences in the expression ratios of the ETS-1 splice variants within each cell line were also found. In conclusion, we have demonstrated for the first time the novel identification of the ETS-1 splice variants p42 and p27 in PCa cell lines. It is very likely that the role of ETS-1 p51 in PCa is significantly influenced by the presence of its splice variants ETS-1 p42 and p27 as competition, abundance, affinity, interactions and cross-talk among them will eventually determine the genes that will be targeted and subsequently affect cellular functions. Follow-up studies will need to address in functional terms, the roles of these splice variants in PCa cell lines, as well as their expression in PCa tissues and its correlation with clinical outcome.""","""['David Adler', 'Jacqueline Ochsenfahrt', 'Kerstin Fuchs', 'Nicolas Wernert']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Oncol Rep""","""['The caspase-generated cleavage product of Ets-1 p51 and Ets-1 p27, Cp17, induces apoptosis.', 'Differential expression of ETS family members in prostate cancer tissues and androgen-sensitive and insensitive prostate cancer cell lines.', 'Ets-1 p27: a novel Ets-1 isoform with dominant-negative effects on the transcriptional properties and the subcellular localization of Ets-1 p51.', 'The role of mRNA splicing in prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptor splice variants and prostate cancer: From bench to bedside.', 'Identification and characterization of novel ETV4 splice variants in prostate cancer.']"""

However, due to sensitivity constraints in current enrichment-based CTC detection technologies, there are few published data about CTC prevalence rates and morphologic heterogeneity in early-stage NSCLC, or the correlation of CTCs with disease progression and their usability for clinical staging. We investigated CTC counts, morphology and aggregation in early stage, locally advanced and metastatic NSCLC patients by using a fluid-phase biopsy approach that identifies CTCs without relying on surface-receptor-based enrichment and presents them in sufficiently high definition (HD) to satisfy diagnostic pathology image quality requirements. HD-CTCs were analyzed in blood samples from 78 chemotherapy-naïve NSCLC patients. 73% of the total population had a positive HD-CTC count (>0 CTC in 1 mL of blood) with a median of 4.4 HD-CTCs mL⁻¹ (range 0-515.6) and a mean of 44.7 (±95.2) HD-CTCs mL⁻¹. No significant difference in the medians of HD-CTC counts was detected between stage IV (n = 31, range 0-178.2), stage III (n = 34, range 0-515.6) and stages I/II (n = 13, range 0-442.3). Furthermore, HD-CTCs exhibited a uniformity in terms of molecular and physical characteristics such as fluorescent cytokeratin intensity, nuclear size, frequency of apoptosis and aggregate formation across the spectrum of staging. Our results demonstrate that despite stringent morphologic inclusion criteria for the definition of HD-CTCs, the HD-CTC assay shows high sensitivity in the detection and characterization of both early- and late-stage lung cancer CTCs. Extensive studies are warranted to investigate the prognostic value of CTC profiling in early-stage lung cancer.

Blocking such mechanisms restores antitumor immunity as was demonstrated by the improved survival of patients with metastatic melanoma after treatment with an antibody blocking the CTLA-4 inhibitory receptor (ipilimumab). Enhanced expression of another inhibitory immunoreceptor, programmed death-1 (PD-1), and its ligand, PD-L1, was found to correlate with a poor prognosis in prostate cancer and melanoma. PD-1-blocking antibodies are being developed to modulate antitumor immune responses. To support preclinical and clinical development of anti-PD-1 therapy, we sought to develop biomarker assays that can detect the effect of PD-1-blocking agents in whole blood and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. In this study, we assessed the effect of PD-1 blockade in modulating super antigen (staphylococcus enterotoxin B)-induced and recall antigen (tetanus toxoid)-induced T-cell reactivity in vitro using whole blood and peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with advanced melanoma, prostate cancer, and healthy controls. PD-1 blockade was found to shift antigen-induced cellular reactivity toward a proinflammatory Th1/Th17 response, as evidenced by enhanced production of interferon γ, interleukin (IL)-2, tumor necrosis factor α, IL-6, and IL-17 and reduced production of the Th2 cytokines IL-5 and IL-13. It is interesting to note that suppression of Th2 responsivity was seen with whole blood cells only from patients with cancer. Taken together, we identified novel biomarker assays that might be used to determine the functional consequences of PD-1 blockade in peripheral blood cells from patients with cancer.

The Bone Scan Index (BSI) is predictive of survival in patients with progressive prostate cancer (PCa), but the popularity of this metric is hampered by the tedium of the manual calculation.  Objective:   Develop a fully automated method of quantifying the BSI and determining the clinical value of automated BSI measurements beyond conventional clinical and pathologic features.  Design, setting, and participants:   We conditioned a computer-assisted diagnosis system identifying metastatic lesions on a bone scan to automatically compute BSI measurements. A training group of 795 bone scans was used in the conditioning process. Independent validation of the method used bone scans obtained ≤3 mo from diagnosis of 384 PCa cases in two large population-based cohorts. An experienced analyser (blinded to case identity, prior BSI, and outcome) scored the BSI measurements twice. We measured prediction of outcome using pretreatment Gleason score, clinical stage, and prostate-specific antigen with models that also incorporated either manual or automated BSI measurements.  Measurements:   The agreement between methods was evaluated using Pearson's correlation coefficient. Discrimination between prognostic models was assessed using the concordance index (C-index).  Results and limitations:   Manual and automated BSI measurements were strongly correlated (ρ=0.80), correlated more closely (ρ=0.93) when excluding cases with BSI scores≥10 (1.8%), and were independently associated with PCa death (p<0.0001 for each) when added to the prediction model. Predictive accuracy of the base model (C-index: 0.768; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.702-0.837) increased to 0.794 (95% CI, 0.727-0.860) by adding manual BSI scoring, and increased to 0.825 (95% CI, 0.754-0.881) by adding automated BSI scoring to the base model.

Methods and materials:   From a retrospective study of 826 patients who underwent prostate biopsy between January 2005 and December 2009 at the Instituto Nacional de Cancerología, Mexico, logistic regression was used to assess the effects of age, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), digital rectal exam (DRE), first-degree family history of CaP, and history of a prior prostate biopsy on CaP and HGCaP, separately. Internal discrimination, goodness-of-fit, and clinical utility of the resulting models were assessed with comparison to the PCPTRC.  Results:   Rates of both CaP (73.2%) and HGCaP (33.3%) were high among referral patients in this Mexican urology clinic. The PCPTRC generally underestimated the risk of CaP but overestimated the risk of HGCaP. Four factors influencing CaP on biopsy were logPSA, DRE, family history and a prior biopsy history (all P < 0.001). The internal AUC of the logistic model was 0.823 compared with 0.785 of the PCPTRC for CaP (P < 0.001).

Production of this autologous cellular therapy was initially limited to one facility with supply projected to serve only 2,000 out of approximately 30,000 potentially eligible patients in the United States.  Results and conclusions:   We propose basic guidelines that should be followed when allocating scarce cancer therapies and highlight ongoing challenges that must be resolved both with regard to rationing cancer care and with regard to access to high cost novel interventions in oncology in general.""","""['Jeffrey Peppercorn', 'Andrew Armstrong', 'David W Zaas', 'Daniel George']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Practical guide to immunotherapy in castration resistant prostate cancer: the use of sipuleucel-T immunotherapy.', 'Prostate Cancer Immunotherapy with Sipuleucel-T: Current Standards and Future Directions.', 'Optimizing the efficiency and quality of sipuleucel-T delivery in an academic institution.', 'Targeted treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer with sipuleucel-T immunotherapy.', 'Sipuleucel-T (Provenge®) for castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Ethical considerations for the clinical oncologist in an era of oncology drug shortages.', 'The cost of cancer care--balancing our duties to patients versus society: are they mutually exclusive?', 'The changing landscape in the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.']"""

Methods and materials:   Intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer patients who elected brachytherapy as their treatment of choice were offered SVB for either Gleason score ≥7, prostate-specific antigen levels >10ng/mL, or clinical stage ≥T2b. Three cores were taken from both seminal vesicles at the base of the prostate using transrectal ultrasound. Patients with a positive SVB and either a negative pelvic lymph node dissection or pelvic computerized tomogram were treated with a combination of a partial implant followed by 45Gy of external beam irradiation therapy. During the seed implant, sources were positioned in the anterior wall of the seminal vesicles using intraoperative dosimetry to guide placement. Biochemical freedom from failure was determined using a definition of >0.2ng/mL. Survival was measured using the Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportions projections.  Results:   Of 526 patients who underwent SVB, 52 (9.9%) were positive for prostate cancer invasion. Clinical stage, prostate-specific antigen levels, and Gleason score were all predictive of a positive SVB (p<0.001). The 10-year biochemical freedom from failure was 64%. Cox regression demonstrated Gleason score (p=0.044) and biologic effective dose (p=0.013) as significant.  Conclusions:   Patients with pathologically confirmed seminal vesicle involvement of prostate cancer can be successfully identified and managed by a combined approach of permanent seed implantation to the prostate and seminal vesicles followed by external beam irradiation therapy.

Visualization tools are therefore useful to better understand the underlying structure of the data in a 'blind' (unsupervised) way. A well-established technique to do so is Principal Component Analysis (PCA). PCA is particularly powerful if the biological question is related to the highest variance. Independent Component Analysis (ICA) has been proposed as an alternative to PCA as it optimizes an independence condition to give more meaningful components. However, neither PCA nor ICA can overcome both the high dimensionality and noisy characteristics of biological data.  Results:   We propose Independent Principal Component Analysis (IPCA) that combines the advantages of both PCA and ICA. It uses ICA as a denoising process of the loading vectors produced by PCA to better highlight the important biological entities and reveal insightful patterns in the data. The result is a better clustering of the biological samples on graphical representations. In addition, a sparse version is proposed that performs an internal variable selection to identify biologically relevant features (sIPCA).  Conclusions:   On simulation studies and real data sets, we showed that IPCA offers a better visualization of the data than ICA and with a smaller number of components than PCA. Furthermore, a preliminary investigation of the list of genes selected with sIPCA demonstrate that the approach is well able to highlight relevant genes in the data with respect to the biological experiment.IPCA and sIPCA are both implemented in the R package mixomics dedicated to the analysis and exploration of high dimensional biological data sets, and on mixomics' web-interface.""","""['Fangzhou Yao', 'Jeff Coquery', 'Kim-Anh Lê Cao']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""BMC Bioinformatics""","""['Mining gene expression data by interpreting principal components.', 'Translational Metabolomics of Head Injury: Exploring Dysfunctional Cerebral Metabolism with Ex Vivo NMR Spectroscopy-Based Metabolite Quantification.', 'Independent Component Analysis for Unraveling the Complexity of Cancer Omics Datasets.', 'Nonlinear dimensionality reduction of gene expression data for visualization and clustering analysis of cancer tissue samples.', 'Applying dimension reduction to EEG data by Principal Component Analysis reduces the quality of its subsequent Independent Component decomposition.', 'Comparative serum proteomic analysis of a selected protein panel in individuals with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder and the impact of genetic risk burden on serum proteomic profiles.', 'The use of predictive models to develop chromatography-based purification processes.', 'A drug repurposing endeavor to discover a multi-targeting ligand against RhlR and LasR proteins from opportunistic human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa.', 'Immune Memory After Respiratory Infection With Streptococcus pneumoniae Is Revealed by in vitro Stimulation of Murine Splenocytes With Inactivated Pneumococcal Whole Cells: Evidence of Early Recall Responses by Transcriptomic Analysis.', 'GenomicSuperSignature facilitates interpretation of RNA-seq experiments through robust, efficient comparison to public databases.']"""

Patients and methods:   We reviewed our RARP database at our institution for patients with at least 12 months of follow-up. Erectile function was defined using the University of California, Los Angeles Prostate Cancer Index as erections ""firm enough for masturbation and foreplay"" or ""firm enough for intercourse,"" while urinary continence was defined as being ""pad free."" Only patients who were potent and pad free preoperatively were included in the analysis. Multivariate logistic regression was used to compare postoperative potency and urinary pad-free status between AA and non-AA patients while controlling for pertinent demographic, clinical, and pathologic variables.  Results:   In the urinary continence analysis, 140 AA patients and 576 non-AA patients were included, compared with 105 AAs and 500 non-AA patients who were included in the analysis of sexual function. At 12 months postoperatively, a smaller proportion of AA patients were potent compared with non-AA patients (60% vs 76.4%, P=0.001). Similarly, we found a lower incidence of pad-free status for AA patients at 12 months postoperatively (55.7% vs 69.8%, P=0.039). Similar functional results were found at 6 months postoperatively for both analysis groups.  Conclusion:   AA men appear to have worse urinary and sexual outcomes at 12 months after RARP compared with non-AA patients. At 6 months, there is no statistically significant difference.

In multivariate analysis, a Gleason score ≥ 8 in the surgical specimen (HR = 3.08), existence of affected surgical margins (HR = 2.98), pT3 stage (HR = 1.61) and involvement of more than 50% of the piece by cancer (HR = 3.39) were identified as independent predictors of biochemical recurrence. Stratifying by independent predictors of biochemical recurrence (pT, Gleason score and margin), patients with at least 2 of these factors had an incidence of biochemical recurrence at 5 years exceeding 50%.  Conclusions:   Patients who have a Gleason score ≥ 8, positive margins, pT3 tumour or a percentage of >50% after prostatectomy have an increased risk of biochemical recurrence. Patients with at least 2 predictors of relapse have a probability of recurrence over 50% in the first 5 years of recurrence and should therefore be candidates for adjuvant radiotherapy.""","""['Eva V Paños Fagundo', 'Felipe Herranz Amo', 'Esther López López', 'Javier Piñero Sánchez', 'Gema del Pozo Jiménez', 'Juan Aragón Chamizo', 'José María Díez Cordero', 'María Elena Rodríguez Fernández', 'Carlos Hernández Fernández']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Arch Esp Urol""","""['Impact of positive surgical margins on prostate-specific antigen failure after radical prostatectomy in adjuvant treatment-naïve patients.', 'High Gleason grade carcinoma at a positive surgical margin predicts biochemical failure after radical prostatectomy and may guide adjuvant radiotherapy.', 'External beam radiotherapy versus radical prostatectomy for clinical stage T1-2 prostate cancer: therapeutic implications of stratification by pretreatment PSA levels and biopsy Gleason scores.', 'Positive margins after radical prostatectomy: implications for failure and role of adjuvant treatment.', 'Radical prostatectomy: positive surgical margins matter.']"""

Another accepted attitude is to perform the biopsy after biochemical recurrence, but sometimes the pathological stage is already locally advanced tumor. It is also difficult to determine which patients are suitable for this rescue treatment, probably those with locally confined tumors and with favorable PSA kinetics, PSA velocity below 2.0 or a PSA doubling time over 12 months, and in whom detectable PSA is reached 2 years after treatment. These patients are suitable for radical prostatectomy if they have a live expectancy of more than 10 years.

Materials and methods:   One thousand fifty-eight patients who underwent RALRP at City of Hope from June 2007 to October 2009 were assessed. Endoscopic stapling and suture ligature of the DVC were compared. Positive apical margins were identified and compared based on DVC-control technique. Recurrence probability was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and logistic regression analysis was used to predict the odds of positive apical margins.  Results:   Of 1058 patients, 633 (60%) underwent endoscopic stapling, and 425 (40%) had suture ligature. The groups had similar baseline characteristics including age and body mass index. We observed a statistically different PSA (5.4 ng/mL versus 5.2 ng/mL, p = 0.03) and operative time (2.8 hours versus 2.7 hours, p = 0.02) between stapling and suture groups, but the actual difference was small. Operative time, Gleason score, pathologic stage, and overall positive margin rates were not significantly different between groups. Positive apical margins were observed in 39 (6%) and 27 (6%) patients in the staple and suture groups, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that the positive apical margin rate was greater in patients with higher pathologic stage and final pathological Gleason score.

However several popular DR approaches suffer from sensitivity to choice of parameters and/or presence of noise in the data. In this paper, we present a novel DR technique known as consensus embedding that aims to overcome these problems by generating and combining multiple low-dimensional embeddings, hence exploiting the variance among them in a manner similar to ensemble classifier schemes such as Bagging. We demonstrate theoretical properties of consensus embedding which show that it will result in a single stable embedding solution that preserves information more accurately as compared to any individual embedding (generated via DR schemes such as Principal Component Analysis, Graph Embedding, or Locally Linear Embedding). Intelligent sub-sampling (via mean-shift) and code parallelization are utilized to provide for an efficient implementation of the scheme.  Results:   Applications of consensus embedding are shown in the context of classification and clustering as applied to: (1) image partitioning of white matter and gray matter on 10 different synthetic brain MRI images corrupted with 18 different combinations of noise and bias field inhomogeneity, (2) classification of 4 high-dimensional gene-expression datasets, (3) cancer detection (at a pixel-level) on 16 image slices obtained from 2 different high-resolution prostate MRI datasets. In over 200 different experiments concerning classification and segmentation of biomedical data, consensus embedding was found to consistently outperform both linear and non-linear DR methods within all applications considered.  Conclusions:   We have presented a novel framework termed consensus embedding which leverages ensemble classification theory within dimensionality reduction, allowing for application to a wide range of high-dimensional biomedical data classification and segmentation problems. Our generalizable framework allows for improved representation and classification in the context of both imaging and non-imaging data.

Given that AR-mediated gene regulation is enhanced by AR coregulators, inactivation of those coregulators is emerging as a promising therapy for prostate cancer (PCa). Here, we show that the N-acetyltransferase arrest-defect 1 protein (ARD1) functions as a unique AR regulator in PCa cells. ARD1 is up-regulated in human PCa cell lines and primary tumor biopsies. The expression of ARD1 was augmented by treatment with synthetic androgen (R1881) unless AR is deficient or is inhibited by AR-specific siRNA or androgen inhibitor bicalutamide (Casodex). Depletion of ARD1 by shRNA suppressed PCa cell proliferation, anchorage-independent growth, and xenograft tumor formation in SCID mice, suggesting that AR-dependent ARD1 expression is biologically germane. Notably, ARD1 was critical for transcriptionally regulating a number of AR target genes that are involved in prostate tumorigenesis. Furthermore, ARD1 interacted physically with and acetylated the AR protein in vivo and in vitro. Because AR-ARD1 interaction facilitated the AR binding to its targeted promoters for gene transcription, we propose that ARD1 functions as a unique AR regulator and forms a positive feedback loop for AR-dependent prostate tumorigenesis.

We investigated postdiagnostic milk and dairy intake in relation to risk of lethal prostate cancer (metastases and prostate cancer death) among participants in the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study.  Methods:   The cohort consisted of 3,918 men diagnosed with apparently localized prostate cancer between 1986 and 2006, and followed to 2008. Data on milk and dairy intake were available from repeated questionnaires. We used Cox proportional hazards models to calculate HRs and 95% CIs of the association between postdiagnostic milk and dairy intake and prostate cancer outcomes.  Results:   We ascertained 229 prostate cancer deaths and an additional 69 metastases during follow-up. In multivariate analysis, total milk and dairy intakes after diagnosis were not associated with a greater risk of lethal prostate cancer. Men with the highest versus lowest intake of whole milk were at an increased risk of progression (HR = 2.15, 95% CI: 1.28-3.60; P(trend) < 0.01). Men in the highest versus lowest quintile of low-fat dairy intake were at a decreased risk of progression (HR = 0.62; 95% CI: 0.40-0.95; P(trend) = 0.07).  Conclusions:   With the exception of whole milk, our results suggest that milk and dairy intake after a prostate cancer diagnosis is not associated with an increased risk of lethal prostate cancer.

To date, only a few studies have explored the relationship between CAD and PCa risk, with conflicting results.  Methods:   The four-year REDUCE study tested dutasteride 0.5 mg daily for PCa risk reduction in men with prostate specific antigen (PSA) of 2.5 to 10.0 ng/mL and a negative biopsy. Among men who underwent at least one on-study biopsy (n = 6,729; 82.8%), the association between CAD and overall PCa risk and disease grade was examined with logistic and multinomial logistic regression adjusting for clinicopathologic features, respectively.  Results:   Overall, 547 men (8.6%) had a history of CAD. Men with CAD were significantly older and had higher body mass index, PSA, and larger prostate volumes and were more likely to have diabetes, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia and take aspirin and statins. On multivariate analysis, CAD was associated with a 35% increased risk of PCa diagnosis (OR = 1.35, 95% CI: 1.08-1.67, P = 0.007), while elevating risk of both low- (OR = 1.34, 95% CI: 1.05-1.73, P = 0.02) and high-grade disease (OR = 1.34, 95% CI: 0.95-1.88, P = 0.09).  Conclusions:   In a post hoc hypothesis developing secondary analysis of the REDUCE study, CAD was significantly associated with increased PCa diagnosis.  Impact:   If confirmed in other studies, this suggests CAD may be a novel PCa risk factor and suggests common shared etiologies. Whether lifestyle changes shown to reduce CAD risk (i.e., weight loss, exercise, cholesterol reduction, etc.) can reduce PCa risk, warrants further study.""","""['Jean-Alfred Thomas nd', 'Leah Gerber', 'Lionel L Bañez', 'Daniel M Moreira', 'Roger S Rittmaster', 'Gerald L Andriole', 'Stephen J Freedland']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev""","""['Coronary artery disease in REDUCE--letter.', 'Neoadjuvant hormonal therapy use and the risk of death in men with prostate cancer treated with brachytherapy who have no or at least a single risk factor for coronary artery disease.', 'Calculated fast-growing benign prostatic hyperplasia--a risk factor for developing clinical prostate cancer.', 'Effect of diabetes mellitus on high-grade prostate cancer detection among Japanese obese patients with prostate-specific antigen less than 10 ng/mL.', 'Hyperinsulinaemia: a prospective risk factor for lethal clinical prostate cancer.', 'Risk of developing prostate cancer in the future: overview of prognostic biomarkers.', 'Cardiovascular Complications in Patients with Prostate Cancer: Potential Molecular Connections.', 'Association between coronary artery disease and incident cancer risk: a systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort studies.', 'Assessment of Aortoiliac Atherosclerotic Plaque on CT in Prostate Cancer Patients Undergoing Treatment.', 'Metabolic Syndrome and Physical Inactivity May Be Shared Etiological Agents of Prostate Cancer and Coronary Heart Diseases.', 'Oxidative Stress Links Aging-Associated Cardiovascular Diseases and Prostatic Diseases.']"""

The WASF3 gene has been shown to be up-regulated in high-grade tumors and its down-regulation leads to loss of invasion and metastasis. WASF3 phosphorylation by ABL kinase is essential for its ability to regulate invasion. Mass spectroscopy analysis now shows that HSP90 is present in the WASF3 immunocomplex from prostate cancer cells. Inactivation of HSP90 in these and other cell types does not affect WASF3 stability but prevents its phosphoactivation as a result of destabilization of ABL. HSP70 was also found in the WASF3 immunocomplex and inactivation of HSP70 results in destabilization of WASF3 through proteasome degradation. Knockdown of WASF3, HSP90, and HSP70 individually, all lead to loss of invasion but as knockdown of WASF3 in the presence of robust expression of HSP90/70 has the same effect, it seems that the influence these chaperone proteins have on invasion is mediated, at least in part, by their control over the critical invasion promoting capacity of the WASF3 protein. Overexpression of HSP70 in WASF3 null cells does not enhance invasion.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate correlation of F/T PSA with tumor extracapsular extension (ECE) and biochemical recurrence (BR) at long-term follow-up.  Patient and methods:   Clinical and pathological data were prospectively gathered from 200 patients treated with RP for clinically localized prostate cancer (PCa) and PSA between 4 and 10 ng/mL. Correlations of preoperative variables including F/T PSA with ECE and BR were evaluated with uni- and multivariate analysis. Adjunctive analyses evaluated the association of PSA F/T with other pathological results. The relationship between preoperative F/T PSA and BR was also assessed with Kaplan–Meier survival analysis.  Results:   Lower F/T PSA was significantly correlated with ECE (p = 0.0063), higher GS (p = 0.0054), and seminal vesicles involvement (p = 0.0047). The F/T PSA value of 14% provided the greatest discrimination in predicting ECE. At multivariate analysis, F/T PSA did not achieve the statistical significance for predicting ECE independently. At a mean (median, range) follow-up of 52 (48, 14–116) months, preoperative F/T PSA resulted significantly correlated with BR (p = 0.001). At the Kaplan–Meier survival analysis, the 5-year BR free survival rate resulted 89.3 and 68.9% in the group with F/T PSA >14 and ≤14 ng/mL, respectively (log rank p = 0.0022). At Cox proportional hazard model, only ECE resulted an independent predictor of BR (R = 2.646, p = 0.037).

Materials and methods:   We evaluated prospectively 60 randomized patients with advanced prostate carcinoma, with indication for hormone blockade. The patients were divided into 3 groups of 20: Group (1) received leuprolide 3.75 mg; Group (2) received leuprolide 7.5 mg; and Group (3) received goserelin 3.6 mg.

Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a circulating lipid second messenger involved in cell growth and migration, the immune response, angiogenesis, and malignant transformation.  Methods:   Eighty-eight patients with localised, locally advanced, or metastatic PCa were recruited into this prospective single-centre study. Plasma S1P levels were measured and compared with age-matched controls with benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) (n=110) or with young healthy males with the very small chance of having PCa foci (n=20).  Results:   Levels of circulating S1P were significantly higher in healthy subjects (10.36 ± 0.69 pmol per mg protein, P<0.0001) and patients with BPH (9.39 ± 0.75, P=0.0013) than in patients with PCa (6.89 ± 0.58, ANOVA, P=0.0019). Circulating S1P levels were an early marker of PCa progression to hormonal unresponsiveness and correlated with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels and lymph node metastasis. During the course of the study, nine patients have died of PCa. Importantly, their circulating S1P levels were significantly lower (5.11 ± 0.75) than in the surviving patients (7.02 ± 0.22, n=79, P=0.0439). Our data suggest that the decrease in circulating S1P during PCa progression may stem from a highly significant downregulation of erythrocyte sphingosine kinase-1 (SphK1) activity (2.14 ± 0.17 pmol per mg protein per minute in PCa patients vs 4.7 ± 0.42 in healthy individuals, P<0.0001), which may be a potential mechanism of cancer-induced anaemia.

Methods:   Here, we investigated the correlation of Shp expression with the cellular level of miR-141 and its effects on AR transcriptional activity in non-malignant and malignant human prostate epithelial cell lines.  Results:   We found that Shp was downregulated in multiple PCa cell lines. The mature form of miR-141 was upregulated in PCa cells. miR-141 could target 3'-untranslated region of Shp mRNA resulting in translational suppression and RNA degradation. Moreover, enforced expression of Shp or inhibition of miR-141 function by anti-miR-141 attenuated AR-regulated transcriptional activity in AR-responsive LNCaP cells. Phenethyl isothiocyanate, a natural constituent of many edible cruciferous vegetables, increased Shp expression, downregulated miR-141, and inhibited AR transcriptional activity in LNCaP cells.  Conclusions:   Shp is a target for miR-141 and it is downregulated in cultured human PCa cells with the involvement of upregulation of miR-141, which promotes AR transcriptional activity.

This study included a total of 43 patients with suspected prostate cancer observed over a period of 12 months. Out of 43 consecutive male patients (mean age 69±9.39 years, range 48-100 years), 32 had benign disease (74%) and 11 had prostate carcinoma patients (26%), who had histologically proven prostate cancer. The mean total PSA was 67.9 ng/ml and 12.4 ng/ml in patients with carcinoma prostate and nodular hyperplasia of prostate (NHP) respectively (p<0.05). The mean free PSA in carcinoma patients was 7.4±9.8 ng/ml and in NHP patients it was 2.3±4.1 ng/ml. The difference in mean free PSA concentration was significant (p<0.05). The free to total PSA ratio in two groups was significantly different (p<0.01) from each other. In carcinoma patients, mean F/T PSA ratio was 0.144±0.152 as compared 0.328±0.076 in patients with benign disease. The sensitivity and specificity of the test was calculated at different F/T PSA ratio cutoff. At 0.1 cut off value, sensitivity of the test was 64% and specificity was 84%. The positive predictive value (PPV) was 58% and negative predictive value (NPV) was 87%. From cutoff value of 0.12 to 0.16, sensitivity was increased from 64% to 91% but specificity was reduced from 84% to 59%. The PPV did not show much change and NPV was increased from 89% to 95%. Increasing the cut off value thereafter showed no change in sensitivity but specificity was further reduced to 41%. Therefore in this patient, F/T PSA ratio cut off of 0.15 was found to be the appropriate cutoff value. In 43 men who were biopsied, 11(26%) prostatic carcinoma were identified. Only one patient (9.1%) had F/T PSA ratio above 0.15 and diagnosed by biopsied. Out of 32 patients who were negative for malignancy, 13 patients had F/T PSA ratio more than 0.15 and 19 patients had F/T PSA ratio less than 0.15. The validity of tPSA and F/T PSA ratio in the diagnosis of prostate cancer was identified by calculating their sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV. In case of F/T PSA ratio the sensitivity was 91% and in conventional tPSA the sensitivity was 82%. Specificity was low in both the cases. But in tPSA the specificity was only 13% compare to 59% in F/T PSA. Positive predictive value (PPV) for tPSA was 25% and in F/T PSA it was 44%. Negative predictive value (NPV) for t PSA was 67% and for F/T PSA was 95% which was very high. The effectiveness of F/T PSA ratio at 0.15 cut off value with corresponding tPSA>10ng/ml shows sensitivity 83% in prostate cancer and 50% in NHP patient.""","""['L Chakraborty', 'A N Ahmed', 'B K Paul', 'A Haque', 'A Ara', 'S Nabi', 'M Nessa']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Mymensingh Med J""","""['Utility of free/total prostate specific antigen (f/t PSA) ratio in diagnosis of prostate carcinoma.', 'Significance and limitations of f/tPSA in differential diagnosis of prostate cancer with tPSA levels between 4 and 10 ng/ml.', 'Accurate cut-off point for free to total prostate-specific antigen ratio used to improve differentiation of prostate cancer from benign prostate hyperplasia in Iranian population.', 'The incidence of the variability of the free PSA/total PSA ratio on the early diagnosis of prostate cancer.', 'Use of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) isoforms for the detection of prostate cancer in men with a PSA level of 2-10 ng/ml: systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Actual Contribution of Free to Total PSA Ratio in Prostate Diseases Differentiation.', 'Usefulness of Total PSA Value in Prostate Diseases Diagnosis.']"""

Animal models of bone metastasis induced by inoculating human prostate cell lines into mice are well established. Here, we report the characterization of a mouse model of prostatic bone metastasis using non-invasive microCT and targeted microSPECT imaging of bone tumors using the bombesin receptor (BB2r)-avid radiolabeled peptide, (111)In-DOTA-8-Aoc-BBN[7–14]NH(2).  Procedures:   Immunocompromised mice were inoculated with human prostate cancer cells by intracardiac injection. Metastatic lesion development was monitored by serially imaging mice weekly with microCT. Mice with CT imaging-confirmed bone lesions were administered (111)In-DOTA-8-Aoc-BBN[7–14]NH(2) for microSPECT imaging of BB2r expressing lesions.  Results:   Metastatic bone lesions as small as 0.3 mm in diameter were detected by microCT image analysis as early as 21 days after tumor cell inoculation and had wide anatomical distribution. MicroSPECT imaging using (111)In-DOTA-8-Aoc-BBN[7–14]NH(2) successfully targeted BB2r expressing metastatic bone lesions of the tibia at day 29.  Conclusions:   MicroCT imaging can accurately and non-invasively follow the onset and progression of metastatic bone lesions in mouse models of prostate cancer.

Germline DNA copy number variation (CNV) has recently been implicated in predisposition to cancers such as neuroblastomas as well as prostate and colorectal cancer. We evaluated the role of germline CNVs in breast cancer susceptibility, in particular those with low population frequencies (rare CNVs), which are more likely to cause disease.""  Methods:   Using whole-genome comparative genomic hybridization on microarrays, we screened a cohort of women fulfilling criteria for hereditary breast cancer who did not carry BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations.  Results:   The median numbers of total and rare CNVs per genome were not different between controls and patients. A total of 26 rare germline CNVs were identified in 68 cancer patients, however, a proportion that was significantly different (P = 0.0311) from the control group (23 rare CNVs in 100 individuals). Several of the genes affected by CNV in patients and controls had already been implicated in cancer.  Conclusions:   This study is the first to explore the contribution of germline CNVs to BRCA1/2-negative familial and early-onset breast cancer. The data suggest that rare CNVs may contribute to cancer predisposition in this small cohort of patients, and this trend needs to be confirmed in larger population samples.""","""['Ana Cv Krepischi', 'Maria Isabel W Achatz', 'Erika Mm Santos', 'Silvia S Costa', 'Bianca Cg Lisboa', 'Helena Brentani', 'Tiago M Santos', 'Amanda Gonçalves', 'Amanda F Nóbrega', 'Peter L Pearson', 'Angela M Vianna-Morgante', 'Dirce M Carraro', 'Ricardo R Brentani', 'Carla Rosenberg']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Breast Cancer Res""","""['Hereditary breast and ovarian cancer: assessment of point mutations and copy number variations in Brazilian patients.', 'copy number variation analysis in familial BRCA1/2-negative Finnish breast and ovarian cancer.', 'Copy Number Variants Captured by the Array Comparative Genomic Hybridization in a Cohort of Patients Affected with Hereditary Colorectal Cancer in Sri Lanka: The First CNV Analysis Study of the Hereditary Colorectal Cancer in the Sri Lankan Population.', 'Contribution of BRCA1 large genomic rearrangements to early-onset and familial breast/ovarian cancer in Pakistan.', 'Clinical significance of germline copy number variation in susceptibility of human diseases.', 'Epidemiological, Clinical, and Genomic Profile in Head and Neck Cancer Patients and Their Families.', ""DNA rare copy number alterations in Reinke's Edema."", 'Identification of the Novel Tumor Suppressor Role of FOCAD/miR-491-5p to Inhibit Cancer Stemness, Drug Resistance and Metastasis via Regulating RABIF/MMP Signaling in Triple Negative Breast Cancer.', 'An Integrative Co-localization (INCO) Analysis for SNV and CNV Genomic Features With an Application to Taiwan Biobank Data.', 'Recurrent HBV Integration Targets as Potential Drivers in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.']"""

Prostate cancer characterisation, based on laboratory findings, clinical examination and histopathological cancer features that are used to define selection criteria for AS, is not ideal. Consequently, a panel of strict or more lenient criteria to select patients for AS have been published. Studies investigating the relationship between pretreatment variables and final pathology have been done in the past showing the risk of cancer misclassification for some criteria. No study has presented an overview of cancer selection using a panel of 16 currently used AS criteria that is presented in the present study. In an exactly defined cohort after radical prostatectomy, each set of criteria was used as a diagnostic test to separate between patients with more favourable (pT2, no Gleason upgrade between biopsy grading and final pathology) and unfavourable cancer features (pT3, pN+, Gleason upgrade). To the best of our knowledge a comparison of test quality criteria for AS criteria given by sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value and likelihood ratio has not yet been reported. Moreover, we showed that tumour characterisation, by a formally sufficient 12-core biopsy, in the present dataset harboured a risk of ≈20% that unfavourable cancer features were missed regardless of whether strict or more lenient selection criteria for AS were chosen.  Objective:   To evaluate final histopathological features among men diagnosed with prostate cancer eligible for low-risk (LR) or active surveillance (AS) criteria.  Patients and methods:   Retrospective application of 16 definitions for AS or LR prostate cancer to a contemporary (January 2008 to March 2011) open retropubic radical prostatectomy (RRP) series of 1745 patients.  Exclusion criteria:   neoadjuvant hormones, radiotherapy, inadequate histopathological reports, <10 biopsy cores. Report on the number of men with insignificant tumours (defined as: ≤pT2, Gleason score ≤6, tumour volume <0.5 mL) and men who had unfavourable tumour characteristics on final pathology (defined as: extracapsular extension or seminal vesicle invasion or lymph node metastasis or Gleason upgrading). Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive values (NPV) were calculated.  Results:   Eligibility of patients in the final study cohort (n = 1070) varied from 5.1% to 92.7% depending on the AS or LR criteria used. Final pathology revealed 77 insignificant cancers and 578 patients who had unfavourable histopathological criteria. The detection rate for insignificant cancers on final pathology was variable ranging from 7.8% to 28.3% depending on the AS- or LR-prediction tool used; unfavourable tumour characteristics were found in up to 33.5% on final pathology. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV were 8.5-97.9%, 24.7-97.8%, 67.7-89.1% and 45.3-78.2%, respectively. The likelihood ratio to correctly identify a patient with LR disease on final pathology ranged from 1.3 to 8.  Conclusions:   AS or LR criteria have a significant risk of cancer misclassification. Better prediction tools are needed to improve these criteria. Re-biopsy might improve safety and should be considered more frequently in patients who opt for AS.""","""['Jüri R Palisaar', 'Joachim Noldus', 'Björn Löppenberg', 'Christian von Bodman', 'Florian Sommerer', 'Thilo Eggert']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Comprehensive report on prostate cancer misclassification by 16 currently used low-risk and active surveillance criteria.', 'Pathological and biochemical outcomes after radical prostatectomy in men with low-risk prostate cancer meeting the Prostate Cancer International: Active Surveillance criteria.', 'The ability of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) density to predict an upgrade in Gleason score between initial prostate biopsy and prostatectomy diminishes with increasing tumour grade due to reduced PSA secretion per unit tumour volume.', 'Magnetic resonance imaging does not improve the prediction of misclassification of prostate cancer patients eligible for active surveillance when the most stringent selection criteria are based on the saturation biopsy scheme.', 'Prostatectomy pathology findings in an active surveillance population.', 'Management of localised prostate cancer: watchful waiting, surgery or radiation therapy, depending on the natural course, which is often relatively slow.', 'Diagnostic Accuracy of Contemporary Selection Criteria in Prostate Cancer Patients Eligible for Active Surveillance: A Bayesian Network Meta-Analysis.', 'Trans-Perineal Template-Guided Mapping Biopsy vs. Freehand Trans-Perineal Biopsy in Chinese Patients With PSA < 20 ng/ml: Similar Cancer Detection Rate but Different Lesion Detection Rate.', 'ESTIMATING AND COMPARING CANCER PROGRESSION RISKS UNDER VARYING SURVEILLANCE PROTOCOLS.', 'Circulating miRNAs in localized/locally advanced prostate cancer patients after radical prostatectomy and radiotherapy.', 'Targeting MicroRNAs in Prostate Cancer Radiotherapy.']"""

Metastatic spread to the regional lymph nodes (LNs) is the single worst predictor of survival in prostate cancer. Knowledge of the LN status is crucial, as the treatment strategy is substantially altered in non-organ-confined disease. Current routine pathological protocols for evaluation of LN resection specimens do not demand a minimum of cross-sections per LN to be examined. Depending on the LN size, usually one to two sections are examined. This might lead to underestimation of the true metastatic burden. The present study shows that additional examination of cross-sections in pelvic LNs and applying prostate cancer-specific cytokeratine immunostaining does not lead to significantly increased detection of prostate cancer metastases. However, the work-load and the expenses were significantly higher compared with routine evaluation.  Objective:   To evaluate the diagnostic gain in the detection of lymph node (LN) metastases of prostate cancer and the additional expenses of histological step-section analysis, including immunohistochemistry compared with routine histopathological evaluation.  Patients and methods:   In a prospective study, 19 patients with prostate cancer at high risk of LN metastases (>cT2c and/or PSA level of >20 ng/mL and/or Gleason score >8) underwent sentinel-guided LN resection. All palpable LNs were submitted to step-section analysis in 200-µm sections and concomitant immunohistochemical staining for cytokeratine (AE1/AE3), in addition to routine histopathology of one or two haematoxylin and eosin-stained sections per LN. The number of positive LNs and LN-positive patients for each method was compared; additional expenses in labour time and material for the extended evaluation were estimated.  Results:   In all, 413 LNs were resected; 220 LNs were palpable and were included in the study. In seven of the 19 patients routine histopathological evaluation revealed LN metastases in 24 of 220 LNs (10.9%). Extended LN evaluation with step sectioning and cytokeratin immunohistochemistry did not reveal any additional patients with LN metastases. In one patient already diagnosed with LN metastases on routine histology, four additional LN metastases were detected upon extended LN evaluation. Three LNs of two patients, one of them pN0, contained disseminated tumour cells. Compared with conventional histological evaluation, serial-section analysis and immunohistochemistry increased expenses in materials and labour time 18.7-fold.  Conclusions:   Serial-section analysis seems to have only a minimal diagnostic gain; however, valid conclusions cannot be drawn, as not all LNs were submitted to extended evaluation. Considering the additional expenses, extensive LN evaluation in prostate cancer cannot generally be recommended.""","""['David Schilling', 'Jörg Hennenlotter', 'Georgios Gakis', 'Christian Schwentner', 'Ursula Kuehs', 'Arnulf Stenzl', 'Karl Sotlar']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Update on histopathological evaluation of lymphadenectomy specimens from prostate cancer patients.', 'Quantification of tumor cell burden by analysis of single cell lymph node disaggregates in metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Periprostatic lymph node metastasis in prostate cancer and its clinical significance.', 'The extent of pelvic lymph node dissection correlates with the biochemical recurrence rate in patients with intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer.', 'Sentinel lymph node as a new marker for therapeutic planning in breast cancer patients.', 'Update on histopathological evaluation of lymphadenectomy specimens from prostate cancer patients.', 'Histological step sectioning of pelvic lymph nodes increases the number of identified lymph node metastases.', 'Isolated, disseminated and circulating tumour cells in prostate cancer.']"""

To date, there has been limited impetus to examine the use of cytarabine in prostate cancer. We presented preliminary laboratory data to suggest its utility in the castration refractory prostate cancer (CRPC) population which, combined with a previous case report, suggested it may have hitherto unrecognized utility in this setting. Embedded in this study was peripheral blood sampling for TMPRSS2-ERG and SPINK1, two genes that are believed to define prostate cancer genotypes, to assess their utility as biomarkers This study suggests that at the delivered doses, cytarabine has limited efficacy and significant myelotoxicity suggesting, it does not have a role in the treatment of docetaxel-refractory CRPC. The presence of serum TMPRSS2-ERG and SPINK1 mRNA biomarkers recovered from blood suggest that their analysis is worthy of further study.  Objectives:   To run a phase II clinical trial of cytarabine in men with docetaxel-refractory, castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), based on evidence that cytarabine might be effective in men with abnormalities of ERG oncogenes. To measure mRNA levels of prostate cancer-related genes in blood as biomarkers.  Patients and methods:   Ten of a planned maximum of 30 men received i.v. cytarabine at doses of 0.25-1g/m(2) at 21-day intervals. The primary endpoint was prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response. Archival tumour samples were assessed by fluorescence in-situ hybridization for TMPRSS2:ERG translocation, and by immunohistochemistry for serine peptidase inhibitor Kazal type 1 (SPINK1). Blood was processed for mRNA quantification of TMPRSS2:ERG (exon1:exon4), SPINK1 and PSA.  Results:   A PSA response was not observed in any patient. The trial was stopped at the end of stage 1 of a modified Flemming design. The median number of cycles administered was 3. Grade 3-4 haematological toxicity was common. Five patients were subsequently excluded from the study for toxicity, and five for disease progression. Analysis of whole blood mRNA for T1:E4 translocation in TMPRSS2:ERG was consistent with that in the tumour in 8/9 evaluable cases (one was concordantly positive, seven were concordantly negative), SPINK1 results were concordant in 9/10 cases (two were concordantly positive, seven were concordantly negative [P = 0.047 for the predictive value]). There was no correlation between PSA or SPINK protein and their respective mRNA copy levels in blood.  Conclusions:   Cytarabine at the doses used is ineffective for men with CRPC.

Several risk factors increase VTE after RP: advanced age, comorbidities such as cardiopulmonary disease, rheumatologic diseases, prior history of VTE, more advanced prostate cancer, and simultaneous pelvic lymph node dissection. To date, the effect of annual surgical caseload (ASC), an established determinant of various RP outcomes, has not been tested. A previous study showed in adjusted analyses that patients operated for colorectal cancer by very high ASC surgeons were 60% less likely to suffer a VTE than those operated by low ASC surgeons. Moreover, some authors hypothesized that laparoscopy may contribute to a higher risk of VTE, due to peritoneal insufflation, reverse Trendelenburg position and prolonged operative time. The VTE rates reported in the current population-based study closely reflect those reported in institutional series. Moreover, we validated the practice-makes-perfect concept, since ASC was linked to VTE. We could not detect statistically significantly differences between minimally invasive radical prostatectomy (MIRP) patients and others. Our results indicate that lower rates of VTE should be expected in patients treated by high ASC surgeons. Our findings suggest that VTE-specific processes of care need to be improved, with the intent of reaching the level recorded in patients treated by high ASC surgeons. Finally, MIRP seems to be no risk factor for VTE.  Objective:   To examine the effect of annual surgical caseload (ASC) on the likelihood of venous thromboembolism (VTE) after radical prostatectomy (RP).  Patients and methods:   Between 1999 and 2008, 36 699 RPs were performed in the state of Florida. Logistic regression models predicting the likelihood of VTE were fitted. Covariates included year of surgery, age, race, baseline Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), lymph node dissection, ASC and surgical approach.  Results:   The overall VTE rate was 0.3%. It was higher in patients operated within the low (0.4%) and intermediate (0.3%) ASC tertile than in those operated within the high-ASC tertile (0.1%, P < 0.001). Mortality rate was 6.0% in patients with VTE vs 0.1% in others (P < 0.001). Median length of stay and median total hospital charges were 9 vs 3 days (P < 0.001) and $51 571 vs $24 943 (P < 0.001) in patients with VTE vs others, respectively. In multivariable analyses predicting VTE, patients operated on by low-ASC surgeons were at higher risk of VTE than those operated on by high-ASC surgeons (odds ratio [OR] = 3.78, P < 0.001). Additionally, black patients were more likely to experience a VTE (OR = 1.80, P = 0.023). Patients with CCI ≥ 1 were also more likely to experience a VTE than others (OR = 1.65, P = 0.016). Conversely, patients who had undergone minimally invasive radical prostatectomy were not more likely to experience a VTE than those who had undergone open RP (OR = 1.97, P = 0.086).  Conclusions:   RP by high-ASC surgeons exerts a protective effect on the likelihood of VTE. Additionally, VTE is associated with higher mortality, prolonged length of stay and increased hospital charges.""","""['Jan Schmitges', 'Quoc-Dien Trinh', 'Maxine Sun', 'Firas Abdollah', 'Marco Bianchi', 'Lars Budäus', 'Georg Salomon', 'Thorsten Schlomm', 'Paul Perrotte', 'Shahrokh F Shariat', 'Francesco Montorsi', 'Mani Menon', 'Markus Graefen', 'Pierre I Karakiewicz']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Annual prostatectomy volume is related to rectal laceration rate after radical prostatectomy.', 'The effect of annual surgical caseload on the rates of in-hospital pneumonia and other in-hospital outcomes after radical prostatectomy.', 'The impact of surgical experience on total hospital charges for minimally invasive prostatectomy: a population-based study.', 'Pharmacological prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism in contemporary radical retropubic prostatectomy: does concomitant pelvic lymphadenectomy matter?', 'Perioperative, functional and oncological outcomes after open and minimally invasive prostate cancer surgery: experience from Australasia.', 'Construction and Verification of Risk Predicting Models to Evaluate the Possibility of Venous Thromboembolism After Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Caprini score and surgical times linked to the risk for venous thromboembolism after robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Venous thromboprophylaxis in urological cancer surgery.', 'Perioperative changes in pro and anticoagulant factors in prostate cancer patients undergoing laparoscopic and robotic radical prostatectomy with different anaesthetic techniques.', 'Advances in Robotic-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy over Time.']"""

However, case-control studies are often embedded in existing cohort studies containing a wealth of longitudinal exposure history about the participants. Recent medical studies have indicated that incorporating past exposure history, or a constructed summary measure of cumulative exposure derived from the past exposure history, when available, may lead to more precise and clinically meaningful estimates of the disease risk. In this article, we propose a flexible Bayesian semiparametric approach to model the longitudinal exposure profiles of the cases and controls and then use measures of cumulative exposure based on a weighted integral of this trajectory in the final disease risk model. The estimation is done via a joint likelihood. In the construction of the cumulative exposure summary, we introduce an influence function, a smooth function of time to characterize the association pattern of the exposure profile on the disease status with different time windows potentially having differential influence/weights. This enables us to analyze how the present disease status of a subject is influenced by his/her past exposure history conditional on the current ones. The joint likelihood formulation allows us to properly account for uncertainties associated with both stages of the estimation process in an integrated manner. Analysis is carried out in a hierarchical Bayesian framework using reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms. The proposed methodology is motivated by, and applied to a case-control study of prostate cancer where longitudinal biomarker information is available for the cases and controls.""","""['Dhiman Bhadra', 'Michael J Daniels', 'Sungduk Kim', 'Malay Ghosh', 'Bhramar Mukherjee']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Biometrics""","""['Semiparametric Bayesian modeling of random genetic effects in family-based association studies.', 'Joint partially linear model for longitudinal data with informative drop-outs.', 'Bayesian semiparametric modeling for matched case-control studies with multiple disease states.', 'Bayesian adaptive regression splines for hierarchical data.', 'Joint latent class models for longitudinal and time-to-event data: a review.', 'Two-stage model for time varying effects of zero-inﬂated count longitudinal covariates with applications in health behaviour research.', 'Statistical methods for modeling repeated measures of maternal environmental exposure biomarkers during pregnancy in association with preterm birth.', 'Functional logistic regression approach to detecting gene by longitudinal environmental exposure interaction in a case-control study.', 'Imaging markers for Alzheimer disease: which vs how.', 'On the proportional hazards model for occupational and environmental case-control analyses.']"""

We found that the combination of both a vaccine consisting of 4-1BBL-expressing RM-1 cells and CTLA-4 blockade resulted in regression of RM-1 tumors and a significant increase in survival of the tumour cell recipients, compared to that of either treatment alone. The combined vaccination resulted in higher CTL against RM-1 cells and increased secretion of IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-2 in the mix-cultured supernatant.

Methods:   In this retrospective cohort study, results of transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS)-guided biopsy were assessed in 616 consecutive Chinese men; all subjects had intermediate serum PSA levels and normal digital rectal examination findings. The prostate and transition zone volumes were determined by TRUS. A TZI cutoff value of 0.47 produced the best sensitivity and specificity rates in receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and thus was used to classify the study subjects into two subgroups: group 1 with TZI ≤ 0.47 and group 2 with TZI > 0.47. Logistic regression analysis was used to predict outcomes. The variables that were statistically significant in the stepwise logistic regression analysis were assessed using the ROC curve and the area under the curve.  Results:   Overall, 166 of the 616 patients (26.9%) had histologically confirmed PCa. A total of 238 (38.6%) patients were classified into group 1, of whom 97 (40.8%) exhibited a positive biopsy; and 378 (61.4%) patients were classified into group 2, of whom 69 (18.3%) exhibited a positive biopsy. The stepwise logistic regression analysis revealed that PSA density (PSAD) exhibited the strongest predictive value in the overall population and in group 1, whereas PSA transition zone density (PSATZD) was the optimal predictor in group 2. The ROC curve analysis revealed that when using the TZI-specific 100% sensitivity cutoffs, 17.7% and 25% of the biopsies were unnecessary and could be avoided in the overall patient population prior to and following the division into groups, respectively (P = 0.002). Using an individually generated 95% sensitivity cutoff of 0.12 ng/mL(2) for PSAD and a cutoff of 0.179 ng/mL(2) for PSATZD for TZI-stratified cohorts of TZI ≤ 0.47 and TZI > 0.47, a more consistent specificity of 44% and 46.9%, respectively, for each cohort was observed.  Conclusions:   The optimal predictor for PCa differs between various TZI levels.

We performed case control study to analyze the genetic variants of TLR2, 3 and 9 gene polymorphisms with PCa risk in a North Indian population. For this study we genotyped age matched, unrelated 195 PCa patients and 250 healthy controls of similar ethnicity in a case-control study.

Its inhibition was found to confer protection against certain neurological disorders and cancer. Despite the pivotal role of this enzyme, the most common polymorphism i.e. H475Y has not been explored comprehensively in all its splice variants. In this study, we have determined the role of this variant in different disease conditions such as breast and prostate cancers, autism, coronary artery disease (CAD) and miscarriages (N=1561). Genotyping was done by PCR-RFLP and dideoxy sequencing. Plasma folate levels were estimated by Axysm folate kit. GCPII expression was studied by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. In silico model was developed using PYMOL. We observed the protective role of H475Y variant in cancers [breast cancer; OR (95% CI): 0.81 (0.55-1.19), prostate cancer: OR (95% CI): 0.00 (0.00-0.66)], and in autism (OR (95% CI): 0.47 (0.21-1.03), whereas inflated risk was observed in CAD (OR (95% CI): 1.69 (1.20-2.37) and miscarriages [Maternal OR (95% CI): 3.26 (2.11-5.04); Paternal OR(95% CI): 1.99 (1.23-3.21)].

In silico model of GCPII showed steric hindrance with H475Y resulting in stereochemical alteration of catalytic site, thus interfering with ligand binding. Statistically significant association was not observed between dietary folate levels and GCPII expression. However, a positive correlation was seen between plasma folate levels and GCPII expression (r=0.70, p<0.05).

After applying a selection strategy, we analyzed the methylation status of CpG islands upstream to a subset of miRNAs by methylation-specific PCR. The CpG islands of miR-18b, miR-132, miR-34b/c, miR-148a, miR-450a and miR-542-3p showed methylation patterns congruent with their expression modulations in response to AZA. Methylation analysis of these CpG islands in a panel of 50 human prostate carcinoma specimens and 24 normal controls revealed miR-132 to be methylated in 42% of human cancer cases in a manner positively correlated to total Gleason score and tumor stage. Expression analysis of miR-132 in our tissue panel confirmed its downregulation in methylated tumors. Re-expression of miR-132 in PC3 cells induced cell detachment followed by cell death (anoikis).

Typically, vesicles are modified with distearoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DSPE)-polyethylene glycol (PEG) at a high PEG grafting density. However, long circulation time and slow drug release rate might induce severe hand-foot syndrome in clinical practice. In this study, a liposomal topotecan formulation with a low PEG grafting density was prepared and its pharmacokinetics, acute toxicity and antitumour effect were investigated.  Methods:   Topotecan was loaded into liposomes using an ammonium sulfate gradient. The resulting formulation was injected to healthy Wistar rats at different dose levels to investigate whether its clearance followed linear kinetics. Biodistribution was performed in Lewis lung cancer-bearing mice. The acute toxicity was evaluated in healthy mice and beagle dogs. To compare the antitumour effects of different formulations and dose schedule, RM-1 prostate, Lewis lung, H446 and L1210 cancer models were used.  Key findings:   Topotecan could be encapsulated into low DSPE-PEG liposomes with ∼100% loading efficiency. The clearance of the liposomal formulation followed linear kinetics at a dose level ranging from 0.5 to 4 mg/kg despite the fact that the vesicles were coated at a low PEG density. Compared with free topotecan the liposomal formulation preferentially accumulated into tumour zones instead of normal tissues. Both formulations could rapidly accumulate into liver and tumour, but the liposomal formulation was cleared from tissues at a slow rate relative to the conventional formulation. In rats and beagle dogs, liposomal formulations could not induce skin toxicity. In all the tumour models, smaller split doses were more therapeutically active than larger doses when the overall dose intensity was equivalent.  Conclusions:   This has been the first report that plasma kinetics of a liposomal formulation with a low PEG density followed linear kinetics. Moreover, due to its short circulation half-life, the formulation did not induce skin toxicity. Our data revealed that the dose schedule of liposomal drugs should be adjusted in accordance with the biophysical and biological properties of the formulations to achieve the optimal therapeutic efficacy.""","""['Chunlei Li', 'Caixia Wang', 'Hanyu Yang', 'Xi Zhao', 'Na Wei', 'Jingxia Cui']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""J Pharm Pharmacol""","""['The effect of PEG coating on in vitro cytotoxicity and in vivo disposition of topotecan loaded liposomes in rats.', 'Encapsulation of vinorelbine into cholesterol-polyethylene glycol coated vesicles: drug loading and pharmacokinetic studies.', 'Accelerated blood clearance of pegylated liposomal topotecan: influence of polyethylene glycol grafting density and animal species.', 'In vivo applications of PEG liposomes: unexpected observations.', 'Pharmacokinetics of pegylated liposomal Doxorubicin: review of animal and human studies.', 'Application of Biocompatible Drug Delivery Nanosystems for the Treatment of Naturally Occurring Cancer in Dogs.', 'In vivo evaluation of cetuximab-conjugated poly(γ-glutamic acid)-docetaxel nanomedicines in EGFR-overexpressing gastric cancer xenografts.', 'In vitro assay for measuring real time topotecan release from liposomes: release kinetics and cellular internalization.', 'Biodistribution and pharmacokinetics of EGFR-targeted thiolated gelatin nanoparticles following systemic administration in pancreatic tumor-bearing mice.', 'Natural material adsorbed onto a polymer to enhance immune function.']"""

Radionuclide molecular imaging of HER2 expression in disseminated prostate cancer might identify patients for HER2-targeted therapy. Affibody molecules are small (7 kDa) targeting proteins with high potential as tracers for radionuclide imaging. The goal of this study was to develop an optimal Affibody-based tracer for visualization of HER2 expression in prostate cancer.  Methods:   A synthetic variant of the anti-HER2 Z(HER2:342) Affibody molecule, Z(HER2:S1), was N-terminally conjugated with the chelators DOTA, NOTA and NODAGA. The conjugated proteins were biophysically characterized by electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy (ESI-MS), circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy and surface plasmon resonance (SPR)-based biosensor analysis. After labelling with (111)In, the biodistribution was assessed in normal mice and the two most promising conjugates were further evaluated for tumour targeting in mice bearing DU-145 prostate cancer xenografts.  Results:   The HER2-binding equilibrium dissociation constants were 130, 140 and 90 pM for DOTA-Z(HER2:S1), NOTA-Z(HER2:S1) and NODAGA-Z(HER2:S1), respectively. A comparative study of (111)In-labelled DOTA-Z(HER2:S1), NOTA-Z(HER2:S1) and NODAGA-Z(HER2:S1) in normal mice demonstrated a substantial influence of the chelators on the biodistribution properties of the conjugates. (111)In-NODAGA-Z(HER2:S1) had the most rapid clearance from blood and healthy tissues. (111)In-NOTA-Z(HER2:S1) showed high hepatic uptake and was excluded from further evaluation. (111)In-DOTA-Z(HER2:S1) and (111)In-NODAGA-Z(HER2:S1) demonstrated specific uptake in DU-145 prostate cancer xenografts in nude mice. The tumour uptake of (111)In-NODAGA-Z(HER2:S1), 5.6 ± 0.4%ID/g, was significantly lower than the uptake of (111)In-DOTA-Z(HER2:S1), 7.4 ± 0.5%ID/g, presumably because of lower bioavailability due to more rapid clearance. (111)In-NODAGA-Z(HER2:S1) provided higher tumour-to-blood ratio, but somewhat lower tumour-to-liver, tumour-to-spleen and tumour-to-bone ratios.  Conclusion:   Since distant prostate cancer metastases are situated in bone or bone marrow, the higher tumour-to-bone ratio is the most important.

Gene interference was used to block PSMA and the expression of its splice variants in LNCap cells. Three shRNA fragments were synthesized against PSMA, cloned into the vector pSilencer 2.1-U6-neo, their interference effect was evaluated by RT-PCR and Western blotting, and pSilencer 2.1-U6-neo‑shRNA3 (named p‑shRNA3) was chosen in further analyses.

The ceramide hydrolyzing enzyme acid ceramidase (AC), overexpressed in most prostate tumors, causes an aggressive and invasive phenotype through downstream effectors that have not yet been well characterized. Here, we demonstrate that AC, through generation of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), promotes Ets1 nuclear expression and binding to the promoter region of matrix-degrading protease cathepsin B. Through confocal microscopy and flow cytometry, we found that AC overexpression promotes pericellular localization of cathepsin B and its translocation to the outer leaflet of the cell membrane. AC overexpressing cells have an increased abundance of cathepsin B-enriched invasive structures and enhanced ability to invade through a collagen matrix, but not in the presence of an inhibitor of cathepsin B. In human prostate tissues, AC and cathepsin B overexpression were strongly associated and may relate to poor outcome. These results demonstrate a novel pathway by which AC, through S1P, promotes an invasive phenotype in prostate cancer by causing overexpression and secretion of cathepsin B through activation and nuclear expression of Ets1.

PON1 activity varies widely among individuals, which is in part related to two common nonsynonymous polymorphisms in the PON1 gene (Q192R and L55M). The polymorphisms in PON1 have been implicated in cancer risk. However, results from the studies to date have been conflicting. To clarify the association, a meta-analysis was performed for 7,073 cases and 9,520 controls from 25 published case-control studies. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to assess the strength of the association. Significant associations between PON1-L55M but not Q192R polymorphism and total cancer were observed from all the comparisons. In stratified analyses, PON1-55M allele was a risk factor for breast cancer. Similarly, increased risk was observed for prostate cancer (OR = 1.18, 95% CI: 1.01-1.36, P (heterogeneity) = 0.260) and Caucasian population (OR = 1.18, 95% CI: 1.02-1.38, P (heterogeneity) = 0.1) of the LM genotype, compared with the LL genotype. For PON1-Q192R polymorphism, PON1-192R allele was a decreased risk factor for cancer in the Asian group (RR vs QQ: OR = 0.61, 95% CI: 0.38-0.98, P (heterogeneity) = 0.268; QR vs QQ: OR = 0.71, 95% CI: 0.52-0.96, P (heterogeneity) = 0.130; RR + QR vs QQ: OR = 0.71, 95% CI: 0.53-0.95, P (heterogeneity) = 0.135). Although some modest bias could not be eliminated, this meta-analysis suggests that the PON1-55M allele is a risk factor for the development of cancer, in particular for breast cancer.

Patients with renal failure more frequently harbour RCC due to predisposing factors such as cystic disease of the kidney. The benefit of nephrectomy might be outweighed by adverse perioperative events, however, which may be more prevalent in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). In a population-based study focusing on patients after non-elective colorectal surgery, patients with ESRD had an increased risk of mortality and complications. To date, small-scale studies have reported complication rates in patients with ESRD after nephrectomy for RCC with conflicting results. However, no formal contemporary analysis has been compiled within a nephrectomy cohort of adequate size. The present population-based case-control study showed that patients with ESRD are at substantially higher risk of in-hospital mortality and in-hospital complications. Specifically, we demonstrated higher cardiac-related complications, transfusion and haemorrhage/haematoma rates in patients with ESRD than in others. Moreover, patients with ESRD are more likely to have prolonged length of stay in hospital, and incur higher hospital charges. Based on the findings of the present study, use of biopsy and active surveillance for small, carefully selected renal masses might be considered in patients with ESRD at high risk of morbidity and mortality after surgery.  Objective:   To examine the effect of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on six short-term nephrectomy outcomes.  Patients and methods:   The Nationwide Inpatient Sample was used to assess the rates of blood transfusions, intra-operative and postoperative complications, length of hospital stay (LOS) within the highest quartile (>5 days), total hospital charges within the highest quartile (>$33 391) and in-hospital mortality. Propensity-based matching was performed to adjust for potential baseline differences between patients with ESRD and others. Multivariable logistic regression analyses further adjusted for confounding variables.  Results:   Overall, 46 225 patients underwent open radical, open partial, laparoscopic radical or laparoscopic partial nephrectomy for non-metastatic kidney cancer between 1998 and 2007. Of those, 941 patients with ESRD were identified (2.0%). For patients with ESRD and others, the following rates were recorded, respectively: blood transfusions, 17.4 vs 9.1% (P < 0.001); intra-operative complications, 3.5 vs 3.3% (P = 0.81); postoperative complications, 19.2 vs 15.6% (P = 0.007); length of stay within the highest quartile, 55.4 vs 30.1% (P < 0.001); total hospital charges within the highest quartile, 50.4 vs 26.3% (P < 0.001); in-hospital mortality, 2.4 vs 0.5% (P < 0.001). In multivariable logistic regression analyses, patients with ESRD were more likely to receive a blood transfusion (odds ratio [OR] = 2.05, P < 0.001), to experience any postoperative complication (OR = 1.25, P = 0.019), to have a LOS within the highest quartile (OR = 3.06, P < 0.001), to have hospital charges within the highest quartile (OR = 3.10, P < 0.001), and to die during hospitalization (OR = 4.85, P < 0.001).

It has an active immunologic armamentarium. There are three major prostate abnormalities namely, prostatitis, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and prostate cancer. In all these abnormalities, infection/inflammation has been implicated. As infection/inflammation of the male genital tract can also be involved in induction of antisperm antibodies (ASA), this study was conducted to examine if these prostate abnormalities lead to the formation of ASA. Sera were obtained from normal healthy men (n = 20), men with chronic prostatitis (n = 20), men with BPH (n = 25), men with prostate cancer (n = 25) and immunoinfertile men (n = 10). The presence of antisperm antibodies against lithium diiodosalicylate (LIS)-solubilized human sperm extract (HSE), seminal plasma and synthetic peptides based upon sperm-specific antigens namely fertilization antigen (FA-1) and YLP(12), were analysed using the sperm immobilization technique (SIT), tray agglutination technique (TAT), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and indirect immunobead binding technique (IBT). All the sera from normal men and men with prostate abnormalities (chronic prostatitis/BPH/prostate cancer) were found to be negative in SIT and TAT. In ELISA, a few sera from men having prostate abnormalities (4-24%) showed a weak positive immunoreactivity (2-3 SD units) with some of the spermatozoa/seminal plasma antigens. Majority of the samples did not show any immunoreactivity (<2 SD units) in ELISA. Even the samples that showed a weak positive immunoreactivity in ELISA did not bind to live human sperm in IBT, indicating lack of sperm binding antibodies in these sera. In all these assays, the sera from immunoinfertile men were positive. Our findings indicate that chronic prostatitis, BPH and prostate cancer do not induce antibodies to spermatozoa, sperm-specific antigens and seminal plasma components. Although prostate is an immunologically competent organ, and its abnormalities cause a rise in circulating prostate-specific antigen (PSA), it appears that there is no concomitant induction of immunity to spermatozoa/seminal components including sperm-specific fertility-related antigens, thus not causing ASA-induced immunoinfertlity. This is the first study to our knowledge reporting the absence of ASA in men with BPH and prostate cancer.""","""['P Hoover', 'R K Naz']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Int J Androl""","""['Presence of PSA auto-antibodies in men with prostate abnormalities (prostate cancer/benign prostatic hyperplasia/prostatitis).', 'Presence of antibodies to sperm YLP(12) synthetic peptide in sera and seminal plasma of immunoinfertile men.', 'Antibodies to prostate-specific antigen in immunoinfertile women and men.', 'Implications of prostate inflammation on male fertility.', 'Interleukin 8 and the male genital tract.', 'Seasonal expressions of VEGF and its receptors VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 in the prostate of the wild ground squirrels (<em>Spermophilus dauricus</em>).', 'Chronic prostatitis and its detrimental impact on sperm parameters: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'The role of the prostate in male fertility, health and disease.', 'Prostasomes: Their Characterisation: Implications for Human Reproduction: Prostasomes and Human Reproduction.']"""

Given the important roles of these genes in tumor control, the present study was conducted to test the hypothesis that there was different expression of NF-kB in androgen- dependent or androgen-independent prostate cancer cells. In addition NF-kB decoy oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) were transfected into two prostate cancer cells to determine affects on growth and apoptosis.  Methods:   First, NF-kB decoy ODNs were designed according to the NF-κB elements in the promoter region of c-myc gene. Then, NF-kB and control decoy ODNs were transfected with lipofectamine. Their influence on prostate cancer cell line proliferative activity was detected by MTT assay. Cell apoptosis was determined by flow cytometric(FCM) analysis and AO/EB study. Thirdly, nuclear extracts were prepared from PC-3M cells and DNA-protein interactions were examined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Lastly, to confirm mechanisms of action, a pGL3-C-MYC luciferase expression vector containing a fragment of the c-myc promoter was constructed and co-transfected with NF-kB decoy ODNs into PC-3M cells with lipofectamineTM2000. Expression levels of related endogenous genes were assessed by western blotting.  Results:   We found overexpression of NF-kB in the androgen-independent prostate cancer cell line PC-3M compared to the androgen-independent LNCaP. Treatment with NF-kB decoy ODNs resulted in strong suppression of proliferation, especially in the PC-3M case. Induction of apoptosis of PC-3M was observed in FCM and AO/EB studies. Activity of luciferase was significantly reduced in the NF-kB decoy-transfected cells, but not in cells transfected with a control decoy. Furthermore, we found that expression of some endogenous genes was reduced, while other genes transcripts were induced. EMSA demonstrated specific binding of the NF-kB decoy to NF-kB protein.  Conclusions:   These findings indicate that NF-kB activation plays an important role in evolution of androgen-independent prostate cancer via manipulating expression of target genes. Inhibitors of NF-kB may thus offer promise as a therapeutic approach for the treatment of androgen-independent prostate cancer. NF-kB decoy ODNs may allow development of therapeutic and investigative tools for human malignancies.""","""['Yongqi Fang', 'Hongli Sun', 'Jing Zhai', 'Yuanying Zhang', 'Shuying Yi', 'Gangping Hao', 'Tao Wang']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Asian Pac J Cancer Prev""","""['Antitumor activity of decoy oligodeoxynucleotides targeted to NF-kappaB in vitro and in vivo.', 'The inhibitory effects of dumb-bell decoy oligodeoxynucleotides targeting NF-kappaB on the growth of multiple myeloma cells and IL-6 expression.', 'Antitumor mechanisms of oligodeoxynucleotides with CpG and polyG motifs in murine prostate cancer cells: decrease of NF-kappaB and AP-1 binding activities and induction of apoptosis.', 'NF-kappaB activation in human prostate cancer: important mediator or epiphenomenon?', 'Regulation of NF-kappaB signaling by decoy oligodeoxynucleotides.', 'Immunobiology of periprosthetic inflammation and pain following ultra-high-molecular-weight-polyethylene wear debris in the lumbar spine.', 'Hsp70 and gama-Semino protein as possible prognostic marker of prostate cancer.', 'Oridonin exerts anticancer effect on osteosarcoma by activating PPAR-γ and inhibiting Nrf2 pathway.', 'Inhibition of Allergic Response by Intranasal Selective NF-κB Decoy Oligodeoxynucleotides in a Murine Model of Allergic Rhinitis.', 'KHF16 is a Leading Structure from Cimicifuga foetida that Suppresses Breast Cancer Partially by Inhibiting the NF-κB Signaling Pathway.']"""

Material and methods:   The study included data from 605 consecutive patients treated with RRP for localized prostate cancer. Patients with node-positive disease were excluded. Biochemical recurrence-free survival was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate and multivariate analysis was used to assess risk factors.  Results:   The overall PSM rate was 35.4%. Eighty-three per cent (82.7%) of these had a single PSM, whereas 17.3% of patients had two or more PSMs. Apical PSMs were present in 42.5% and non-apical in 57.5%. The presence of any PSM had a significant impact on the risk of biochemical recurrence (BR) [hazard ratio (HR) = 3.3, p < 0.0001]. Compared with margin-negative patients, both apical and non-apical PSMs increased the risk of BR (HR = 2.1 and 4.2, p = 0.02 and p < 0.0001, respectively). The number of PSMs also influenced the risk of BR (one PSM: HR = 2.8, p < 0.0001, vs two or more PSMs: HR = 5.5, p < 0.0001). In multivariate analysis, pT category, PSA and prostatectomy Gleason score independently increased the risk of BR. In an exploratory multivariate analysis of pT2 tumours, the impact of apical PSMs on biochemical recurrence-free survival (BRFS) was not statistically significant, although with an HR of 2.1. Non-apical PSM was associated with a significantly increased risk of BR (HR = 3.4, p = 0.01). Number of PSMs did not influence the risk of BR in multivariate analysis.

In this work, the authors study a method to adapt intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) treatment plans so as to compensate for this motion by adaptively morphing the multileaf collimator apertures and adjusting the segment weights.  Methods:   The study used CT images, tumor volumes, and normal tissue contours from patients treated in our institution. An IMRT treatment plan was then created using direct aperture optimization to deliver 45 Gy to the pelvic lymph nodes and 50 Gy to the prostate and seminal vesicles. The prostate target volume was then shifted in either the anterior-posterior direction or in the superior-inferior direction. The treatment plan was adapted by adjusting the aperture shapes with or without re-optimizing the segment weighting. The dose to the target volumes was then determined for the adapted plan.  Results:   Without compensation for prostate motion, 1 cm shifts of the prostate resulted in an average decrease of 14% in D-95%. If the isocenter is simply shifted to match the prostate motion, the prostate receives the correct dose but the pelvic lymph nodes are underdosed by 14% ± 6%. The use of adaptive morphing (with or without segment weight optimization) reduces the average change in D-95% to less than 5% for both the pelvic lymph nodes and the prostate.  Conclusions:   Adaptive morphing with and without segment weight optimization can be used to compensate for the independent motion of the prostate and lymph nodes when combined with daily imaging or other methods to track the prostate motion. This method allows the delivery of the correct dose to both the prostate and lymph nodes with only small changes to the dose delivered to the target volumes.""","""['A B Hwang', 'J Chen', 'T B Nguyen', 'A G Gottschalk', 'M R Roach', 'J Pouliot']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Effect of MLC leaf width on treatment adaptation and accuracy for concurrent irradiation of prostate and pelvic lymph nodes.', 'Offline multiple adaptive planning strategy for concurrent irradiation of the prostate and pelvic lymph nodes.', 'Pelvic nodal dose escalation with prostate hypofractionation using conformal avoidance defined (H-CAD) intensity modulated radiation therapy.', ""Practical aspects of inverse-planned intensity-modulated radiation therapy for prostate cancer: a radiation treatment planner's perspective."", 'Prostate cancer.', 'Varian ethos online adaptive radiotherapy for prostate cancer: Early results of contouring accuracy, treatment plan quality, and treatment time.', 'Impact of prostate focused alignment on planned pelvic lymph node dose.']"""

Methods:   Plans adhering to the RTOG-0126 protocol are developed for 28 prostate patients using PTP and margin-based planning. For PTP, an objective function that simultaneously considers multiple possible patient positions is developed. PTP plans are optimized using clinical target volume (CTV) structures and organ at risk (OAR) structures. The desired CTV coverage probability is 95%. Plans that cannot achieve a 95% CTV coverage probability are re-optimized with a desired CTV coverage probability reduced by 5% until the desired CTV coverage probability is achieved. Margin-based plans are created which achieve the same CTV coverage probability as the PTP plans by iterative adjustment of the CTV-to-PTV margin. Postoptimization, probabilistic dose-volume coverage metrics are used to compare the plans.  Results:   For equivalent target coverage probability, PTP plans significantly reduce coverage probability for rectum objectives (-17% for D(35) < 65 Gy, p = 0.0010; -23% for D(25) < 70 Gy, p < 0.0001; and -27% for D(15) < 75 Gy, p < 0.0001). Physician assessment indicates PTP plans are entirely preferred 71% of the time while margin-based plans are entirely preferred 7% of the time.

The conventional inverse treatment planning of IMPT optimized based on the planning target volume (PTV) is not often sufficient to ensure robustness of treatment plans. In this paper, a method that takes the uncertainties into account during plan optimization is used to mitigate the influence of uncertainties in IMPT.  Methods:   The authors use the so-called ""worst-case robust optimization"" to render IMPT plans robust in the face of uncertainties. For each iteration, nine different dose distributions are computed-one each for ± setup uncertainties along anteroposterior (A-P), lateral (R-L) and superior-inferior (S-I) directions, for ± range uncertainty, and the nominal dose distribution. The worst-case dose distribution is obtained by assigning the lowest dose among the nine doses to each voxel in the clinical target volume (CTV) and the highest dose to each voxel outside the CTV. Conceptually, the use of worst-case dose distribution is similar to the dose distribution achieved based on the use of PTV in traditional planning. The objective function value for a given iteration is computed using this worst-case dose distribution. The objective function used has been extended to further constrain the target dose inhomogeneity.  Results:   The worst-case robust optimization method is applied to a lung case, a skull base case, and a prostate case. Compared with IMPT plans optimized using conventional methods based on the PTV, our method yields plans that are considerably less sensitive to range and setup uncertainties. An interesting finding of the work presented here is that, in addition to reducing sensitivity to uncertainties, robust optimization also leads to improved optimality of treatment plans compared to the PTV-based optimization. This is reflected in reduction in plan scores and in the lower normal tissue doses for the same coverage of the target volume when subjected to uncertainties.  Conclusions:   The authors find that the worst-case robust optimization provides robust target coverage without sacrificing, and possibly even improving, the sparing of normal tissues. Our results demonstrate the importance of robust optimization. The authors assert that all IMPT plans should be robustly optimized.""","""['Wei Liu', 'Xiaodong Zhang', 'Yupeng Li', 'Radhe Mohan']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Effectiveness of robust optimization in intensity-modulated proton therapy planning for head and neck cancers.', 'Comparison of linear and nonlinear programming approaches for ""worst case dose"" and ""minmax"" robust optimization of intensity-modulated proton therapy dose distributions.', 'PTV-based IMPT optimization incorporating planning risk volumes vs robust optimization.', 'Robust Proton Treatment Planning: Physical and Biological Optimization.', 'Robust radiotherapy planning.', 'Beam mask and sliding window-facilitated deep learning-based accurate and efficient dose prediction for pencil beam scanning proton therapy.', 'Deep-Learning-based Fast and Accurate 3D CT Deformable Image Registration in Lung Cancer.', 'Fraction optimization for hybrid proton-photon treatment planning.', 'Spot delivery error predictions for intensity modulated proton therapy using robustness analysis with machine learning.', 'Dosimetric advantages of robust optimization combined with flattening filter free in treating cancer of the left breast.']"""

The authors performed a risk comparison study for two standard step-and-shoot IMRT plans and two step-and-shoot Rotational IMRT plans that were designed specifically for a Siemens Primus linear accelerator.  Methods:   CT images of a RANDO phantom were used to generate R-IMRT and static IMRT plans. One simple and one complex prostate cases were created to investigate these techniques. The R-IMRT plans consisted of 72 single-segmented 6 MV beams, equally spaced with beam angle separations of 5°. The static IMRT plans employed seven multisegmented 6 MV beams. Both types of plans were optimized in Pinnacle(3) with the direct machine parameter optimization (DMPO) algorithm using the same set of optimization objectives. The plans were delivered to a RANDO phantom and thermoluminescent diode (TLD) dose measurements were performed at various locations throughout the phantom. Risk coefficients and organ weightings as defined by International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) Publication 103 were used to calculate the resulting effective doses to various organs at risk, as well as the overall risk estimate for both techniques.  Results:   For the simple prostate case, the R-IMRT technique provided a higher dose to organs at risk within the CT volume and a lower overall peripheral dose to remaining organs. The R-IMRT plan had a risk estimate of 4.56% when compared to the IMRT risk of 4.78%. For the complex prostate case, there was no significant difference in the lifetime risks of the IMRT (5.73%) and R-IMRT (5.74%) plans.

Concern has been raised for the corresponding undesired hot spots, and various methods to mitigate these have been developed. The hypotheses upon this work is based are (a) that one cause for the long dwell times is the use of objective functions comprising simple linear penalties and (b) that alternative penalties, as these are piecewise linear, would lead to reduced length of individual dwell times.  Methods:   The characteristics of the linear penalties and the piecewise linear penalties are analyzed mathematically. Experimental comparisons between the two types of penalties are carried out retrospectively for a set of prostate cancer patients.  Results:   When the two types of penalties are compared, significant changes can be seen in the dwell times, while most dose-volume parameters do not differ significantly. On average, total dwell times were reduced by 4.2%, with a reduction of maximum dwell times by 25%, when the alternative penalties were used.  Conclusions:   The use of linear penalties in optimization models for HDR brachytherapy is one cause for the undesired long dwell times that arise in mathematically optimized plans. By introducing alternative penalties, a significant reduction in dwell times can be achieved for HDR brachytherapy dose plans. Although various measures for mitigating the long dwell times are already available, the observation that linear penalties contribute to their appearance is of fundamental interest.""","""['Asa Holm', 'Torbjorn Larsson', 'Asa Carlsson Tedgren']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Optimization of HDR brachytherapy dose distributions using linear programming with penalty costs.', 'Evaluation of anatomy-based dwell position and inverse optimization in high-dose-rate brachytherapy of prostate cancer: a dosimetric comparison to a conventional cylindrical dwell position, geometric optimization, and dose-point optimization.', 'Adaptation of the CVT algorithm for catheter optimization in high dose rate brachytherapy.', 'A gEUD-based inverse planning technique for HDR prostate brachytherapy: feasibility study.', 'Optimization in treatment planning of high dose-rate brachytherapy - Review and analysis of mathematical models.', 'An Inverse Dose Optimization Algorithm for Three-Dimensional Brachytherapy.', 'An extended dose-volume model in high dose-rate brachytherapy - Using mean-tail-dose to reduce tumor underdosage.', 'A fast multitarget inverse treatment planning strategy optimizing dosimetric measures for high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy.']"""

However, the orientation of stranded seeds soon after implantation is predictable, as these seeds tend to maintain their relative spacing, and orient themselves along the implant trajectory. The aim of this study was to develop a method for determining seed orientations from reconstructed strand trajectories, and to use this information to investigate the dosimetric impact of applying the TG-43 2D formalism to clinical postimplant analysis.  Methods:   Using in-house software, the preplan to postimplant seed correspondence was determined for a cohort of 30 patients during routine day-0 CT-based postimplant dosimetry. All patients were implanted with stranded-seed trains. Spline curves were fit to each set of seeds composing a strand, with the requirement that the distance along the spline between seeds be equal to the seed spacing within the strand. The orientations of the seeds were estimated by the tangents to the spline at each seed centroid. Dose distributions were then determined using the 1D and 2D TG-43 formalisms. These were compared using the TG-137 recommended dose metrics for the prostate, prostatic urethra, and rectum.  Results:   Seven hundred and sixty one strands were analyzed in total. Defining the z-axis to be cranial-positive and the x-axis to be left-lateral positive in the CT coordinate system, the average seed had an inclination of 21° ± 10° and an azimuth of -81° ± 57°. These values correspond to the average strand rising anteriorly from apex to base, approximately parallel to the midsagittal plane. Clinically minor but statistically significant differences in dose metrics were noted. Compared to the 2D calculation, the 1D calculation underestimated prostate V100 by 1.1% and D90 by 2.3 Gy, while overestimating V150 and V200 by 1.6% and 1.3%, respectively. Urethral and rectal dose quantifiers tended to be underestimated by the 1D calculation. The most pronounced differences were in the urethral D30 and rectal D2cc, which rose by 3.8 and 1.9 Gy, respectively, using the 2D calculation. The total volume of the 100% isodose region as a percentage of the prostate volume was found to increase by 0.4%.  Conclusions:   Stranded seeds in the supine patient are not oriented in a uniformly random manner, nor are they aligned along the axis of the CT scanner. Instead, this study identified a consistent anterior pitch that is likely attributable to differences in patient pose between implant and CT imaging. The angle of the ultrasound probe with respect to the patient during implant may have also been a contributing factor. The dose metrics derived using the 1D formalism were found to be within 2%, on average, of those derived using the 2D formalism. For greater accuracy, 2D dosimetry can be pursued using the strand-fitting method described in this work. If a 1D representation is used, integrating over the empirically determined seed orientation density reported here may be more appropriate than assuming that seed inclinations are distributed uniformly.""","""['Nicholas Chng', 'Ingrid Spadinger', 'Rosey Rasoda', 'W James Morris', 'Septimiu Salcudean']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Prostate seed implantation using 3D-computer assisted intraoperative planning vs. a standard look-up nomogram: Improved target conformality with reduction in urethral and rectal wall dose.', 'Quantifying the effect of seed orientation in postplanning dosimetry of low-dose-rate prostate brachytherapy.', 'Correlation between real-time intraoperative and postoperative dosimetry and its implications on intraoperative planning.', 'The American Brachytherapy Society recommendations for permanent prostate brachytherapy postimplant dosimetric analysis.', 'Which patients benefit from post-implant CT dosimetry after real-time intraoperative planning for low dose rate prostate brachytherapy?

Outpatient medical records for 120 breast, lung, head and neck, colon, prostate, and acute leukemia cancer patients were reviewed to assess current smoking cessation assessment and intervention documentation practices.  Results:   Providers reported commonly assessing smoking in new patients (82.4% frequently or always), but rates declined at subsequent visits for both current smokers and recent quitters. Rates of advising patients to quit smoking were also high (86.5% frequently or always), but <30% of providers reported frequently or always providing intervention to smoking patients (e.g., nicotine replacement therapy or other medications, self-help materials, and/or referrals). Only 30% of providers reported that they frequently or always followed up with patients to assess progress with quitting. Few providers (18.1%) reported high levels of confidence in their ability to counsel smoking patients. Patients' lack of motivation was identified as the most important barrier to smoking cessation.

Methods:   Using administrative data from advanced lung, prostate, colon, or breast cancer patients diagnosed between January 2000 and December 2007 at four HMOs with integrated delivery systems, patients with an inpatient or outpatient VTE diagnosed within 2 years after cancer diagnosis and an outpatient purchase of warfarin, LMWH, and/or fondaparinux anticoagulant within 7 days of the VTE diagnosis were identified.

Results:   Overall, 25% of the 1,089 eligible patients received LMWH monotherapy as primary VTE treatment. The percentage increased steadily over time from 18% among patients diagnosed in 2000 to 31% among those diagnosed in 2007. Factors associated with LMWH monotherapy included VTE diagnosis year, chemotherapy within 60 days prior to VTE diagnosis, history of VTE prior to cancer diagnosis, and invasive surgery in the 90 days following VTE diagnosis. Colorectal and prostate cancer patients versus lung cancer patients and stage III versus stage IV patients were less likely to be treated with LMWH monotherapy.

Understanding the clonal origin of multifocal cancers is of both etiological and clinical importance. The molecular basis of multifocal prostate cancer has previously been explored using a limited number of isolated markers and, although independent origin is widely believed, the clonal origin of multifocal prostate cancer is still debatable. We attempted to address clonal origin using a genome-wide copy-number analysis of individual cancer and high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN) lesions. Using Affymetrix array 6.0 copy-number analysis, we compared the genomic changes detected in 48 individual cancer and HGPIN lesions, isolated from 18 clinically localized prostate cancer cases. Identical genomic copy-number changes, shared by all same-case cancer foci, were detected in all 13 informative cases displaying multiple tumor foci. In addition, individual HGPIN lesions in the two multifocal-HGPIN cases available shared identical genomic changes. Commonly known genomic alterations, including losses at 6q15, 8p21.3-8p21.2, 10q23.2-10q23.31, 16q22.3, 16q23.2-16q23.3 and 21q22.2-21q22.3 regions and gain of 8q24.3 were the most frequently detected changes in this study and each was detected in all same-case foci in at least one case. Microarray data were confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization in selected foci. Our high-resolution genome-wide copy-number data suggest that many multifocal cases derive from a single prostate cancer precursor clone and that this precursor may give rise to separate HGPIN foci and may further progress to multifocal invasive prostate cancer. These findings, which demonstrate the monoclonal origin of multifocal prostate cancer, should significantly enhance our understanding of prostate carcinogenesis.""","""['Lara K Boyd', 'Xueying Mao', 'Liyan Xue', 'Dongmei Lin', 'Tracy Chaplin', 'Sakunthala C Kudahetti', 'Elzbieta Stankiewicz', 'Yongwei Yu', 'Luis Beltran', 'Greg Shaw', 'John Hines', 'R Tim D Oliver', 'Daniel M Berney', 'Bryan D Young', 'Yong-Jie Lu']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Genes Chromosomes Cancer""","""['Molecular evidence that invasive adenocarcinoma can mimic prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) and intraductal carcinoma through retrograde glandular colonization.', 'Genetic Progression of High Grade Prostatic Intraepithelial Neoplasia to Prostate Cancer.', 'TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion causing ERG overexpression precedes chromosome copy number changes in prostate carcinomas and paired HGPIN lesions.', 'In situ and intraductal epithelial proliferations of prostate: definitions and treatment implications.

The standard medication for advanced prostate cancer, androgen deprivation therapy(ADT)has been associated with bone loss, consequently, the management of controlling the risk of fracture is required. A new drug denosumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds to RANKL, a cytokine essential for the differentiation, function, and survival of osteoclasts which mainly regulate bone metabolic turnover. In a phase 3 clinical study in patients with bone metastasis of castrate-resistant prostate cancer, 120 mg denosumabsub cutaneously every 4 weeks statistically significantly delayed the time to first skeletal-related events(SRE)by 18% and also the time to first and subsequent on-study SRE by 18%when compared with that of the standard of care, 4 mg zoledronic acid by iv infusion every 4 weeks. In another phase 3 clinical study in patients with castrate-resistant prostate cancer without bone metastases, 120 mg once in 4-week subcutaneous injection of denosumab has been indicated to delay the onset of the bone metastasis significantly when compared with placebo. In another phase 3 clinical study in patients with hormone-sensitive nonmetastatic prostate cancer, 60 mg denosumab subcutaneously every 6 months significantly reversed bone loss due to ADT and demonstrated statistically significant prevention of vertebral fractures compared with placebo. Based on these evidences, it has been proved that denosumab is effective in many different stages across the disease continuum of advanced prostate cancer. In US, denosumab has been approved for the indication of prevention of SRE caused by bone metastasis of solid tumor since 2010. Denosumab is useful for treatment of bone metastases from prostate cancer, because the administration route is an every 4-week subcutaneous injection and, dose adjustment by renal impairment is not required. The use of denosumab will be expected to largely contribute to prostate cancer treatment in the future.""","""['Hideyuki Akaza', 'Taiji Tsukamoto', 'Kazuhiro Suzuki', 'Mikio Namiki', 'Seiichiro Ozono', 'Seiji Naitodept']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Gan To Kagaku Ryoho""","""['Anti-RANKL antibody for treatment of patients with bone metastasis from breast cancer.', 'Denosumab for the prevention of skeletal-related events in patients with bone metastasis from solid tumor.', 'Randomized, double-blind study of denosumab versus zoledronic acid in the treatment of bone metastases in patients with advanced cancer (excluding breast and prostate cancer) or multiple myeloma.', 'Economic evaluation of denosumab compared with zoledronic acid in hormone-refractory prostate cancer patients with bone metastases.', 'Anti-RANKL antibody for the management of bone metastasis.']"""

Here we describe a Demons field-initialized B-spline deformable registration of prostate MRI.  Material and methods:   T2-weighted endorectal MRIs of five patients were used. The prostate and the tumor of each patient were manually contoured. The planning MRIs and their segmentations were simulated by warping the corresponding endorectal MRIs using thin plate spline (TPS). Deformable registration was initialized using the deformation field generated using Demons algorithm to map the deformed prostate MRI to the non-deformed one. The solution was refined with B-Spline registration. Volume overlap similarity was used to assess the accuracy of registration and to suggest a minimum margin to account for the registration errors.  Results:   Initialization using Demons algorithm took about 15 min on a computer with 2.8 GHz Intel, 1.3 GB RAM. Refinement B-spline registration (200 iterations) took less than 5 min. Using the synthetic images as the ground truth, at zero margin, the average (S.D.) 98 (±0.4)% for prostate coverage was 97 (±1)% for tumor. The average (±S.D.) treatment margin required to cover the entire prostate was 1.5 (±0.2)mm. The average (± S.D.) treatment margin required to cover the tumor was 0.7 (±0.1)mm.

Multimeric gastrin-releasing peptides are expected to have enhanced tumor uptake and affinity for GRPR. In this study, a 64Cu-labeled 1,4,7-triazacyclononane-1,4,7-triacetic acid [NOTA]-monomer and two NOTA-dimers of [D-Tyr6,βAla11, Thi13, Nle14]bombesin(6-14) ] [BBN(6-14)] were compared.  Methods:   Monomeric and dimeric peptides were synthesized on solid phase support and radiolabeled with 64Cu. NOTA-dimer 1 consists of asymmetrically linked BBN(6-14), while NOTA-dimer 2 has similar spacer between the two BBN(6-14) ligands and the chelator. In vitro GRPR-binding affinities were determined with competitive binding assays on PC3 human prostate cancer cells. In vivo stability and biodistribution of radiolabeled compounds were assessed in Balb/c mice. Cellular uptake and efflux were measured with radiolabeled NOTA-monomer and NOTA-dimer 2 on PC3 cells for up to 4 h. In vivo biodistribution kinetics were measured in PC3 tumor-bearing Balb/c nude mice by μ-positron emission tomography [μPET] imaging and confirmed by dissection and counting.  Results:   NOTA-monomer, NOTA-dimers 1 and 2 were prepared with purity of 99%. The inhibition constants of the three BBN peptides were comparable and in the low nanomolar range. All 64Cu-labeled peptides were stable up to 24 h in mouse plasma and 1 h in vivo. 64Cu/NOTA-dimer 2 featuring a longer spacer between the two BBN(6-14) ligands is a more potent GRPR-targeting probe than 64Cu/NOTA-dimer 1. PC3 tumor uptake profiles are slightly different for 64Cu/NOTA-monomer and 64Cu/NOTA-dimer 2; the monomeric BBN-peptide tracer exhibited higher tumor uptake during the first 0.5 h and a fast renal clearance resulting in higher tumor-to-muscle ratio when compared to 64Cu/NOTA-dimer 2. The latter exhibited higher tumor-to-blood ratio and was retained longer at the tumor site when compared to 64Cu/NOTA-monomer. Lower ratios of tumor-to-blood and tumor-to-muscle in blocking experiments showed GRPR-dependant tumor uptake for both tracers.  Conclusion:   Both 64Cu/NOTA-monomer and 64Cu/NOTA-dimer 2 are suitable for detecting GRPR-positive prostate cancer in vivo by PET. Tumor retention was improved in vivo with 64Cu/NOTA-dimer 2 by applying polyvalency effect and/or statistical rebinding.""","""['Patrick Fournier', 'Véronique Dumulon-Perreault', 'Samia Ait-Mohand', 'Réjean Langlois', 'François Bénard', 'Roger Lecomte', 'Brigitte Guérin']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""EJNMMI Res""","""['Novel radiolabeled peptides for breast and prostate tumor PET imaging: (64)Cu/and (68)Ga/NOTA-PEG-D-Tyr(6),βAla(11),Thi(13),Nle(14)BBN(6-14).', 'A new (68)Ga-labeled BBN peptide with a hydrophilic linker for GRPR-targeted tumor imaging.', '64Cu-NOTA-8-Aoc-BBN(7-14)NH2 targeting vector for positron-emission tomography imaging of gastrin-releasing peptide receptor-expressing tissues.', '64Cu-1,4,7-Triazacyclononane-1,4-diacetic acid-para-aminobenzoic acid-Gln-Trp-Ala-Val-Gly-His-Leu-Met-NH2.', '64Cu-1,4,7-Triazacyclononane-1,4-diacetic acid-9-aminonanoic acid-Gln-Trp-Ala-Val-Gly-His-Leu-Met-NH2.', 'Development of Novel Paclitaxel-Loaded ZIF-8 Metal-Organic Framework Nanoparticles Modified with Peptide Dimers and an Evaluation of Its Inhibitory Effect against Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Human Dose Assessment of 68Ga-NODAGA-RGD-BBN Heterodimer Peptide based on Animal Data.', 'Design, Synthesis, and Cytotoxicity Assessment of 64CuCu-NOTA-Terpyridine Platinum Conjugate: A Novel Chemoradiotherapeutic Agent with Flexible Linker.', 'Enhanced anti-tumor activity of the Multi-Leu peptide PACE4 inhibitor transformed into an albumin-bound tumor-targeting prodrug.', 'Multi-Leu PACE4 Inhibitor Retention within Cells Is PACE4 Dependent and a Prerequisite for Antiproliferative Activity.']"""

A preoperative biofeedback session, combined with postoperative pelvic floor muscle training, and assisted sessions on a monthly basis only, is an effective low-intensity programme to improve recovery of continence in patients undergoing RP.  Objective:   To evaluate the efficacy of preoperative biofeedback (BFB) combined with an assisted low-intensity programme of postoperative perineal physiokinesitherapy in reducing the incidence, duration and severity of urinary incontinence (UI) in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy (RP).  Patients and methods:   A prospective, single-centre, randomized controlled clinical study was designed. • The intervention group received a training session with BFB, supervised oral and written instructions on Kegel exercises and a structured programme of postoperative exercises on the day before open RP. After RP, patients received control visits, including a session of BFB, at monthly intervals only. • The control group received, after catheter removal, only oral and written instructions on Kegel exercises to be performed at home. Patients received control visits at 1, 3 and 6 months after catheter removal. • At each visit the number of incontinence episodes, the number of pads used and patient-reported outcome measures (International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire on Urinary Incontinence [ICIQ-UI], [ICIQ]-Overactive Bladder [OAB], University of California, Los Angeles-Prostate Cancer Index [UCLA-PCI], International Prostate Symptom Score-Quality of Life [IPSS-QoL]) were assessed in both groups. All patients were followed-up for a period of at least 6 months after catheter removal. • The primary outcome was the recovery of continence, strictly defined as a ICIQ-UI score of zero.  Results:   Overall, 34 consecutive patients were eligible and 32 were available for the final analysis: 16 patients for each study group. The two groups were homogeneous for all pre- and intraoperative features examined. • In the intervention group, continence had been achieved by six, eight and 10 patients at 1-, 3- and 6-month follow-ups, respectively, vs no patients (P= 0.02), one patient (P= 0.01) and one patient (P= 0.002) in the control group at each follow-up, respectively. • The analysis of the UCLA-PCI and ICIQ-OAB scores, the number of incontinence episodes per week and the number of pads per week showed significant differences in favour of patients in the intervention group at 3 and 6 months. • Patients in the intervention group reported better IPSS-QoL scores at all follow-up times but the difference did not reach statistical significance.  Conclusions:   Preoperative BFB combined with a postoperative programme of perineal physiokinesitherapy and assisted sessions on a monthly basis only, is a treatment strategy significantly more effective than the standard care in improving recovery of continence in patients undergoing RP. • The impact on QoL appeared less evident, although a trend for a better QoL was observed in the intervention group.""","""['Daniele Tienforti', 'Emilio Sacco', 'Francesco Marangi', ""Alessandro D'Addessi"", 'Marco Racioppi', 'Gaetano Gulino', 'Francesco Pinto', 'Angelo Totaro', ""Daniele D'Agostino"", 'Pierfrancesco Bassi']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Efficacy of an assisted low-intensity programme of perioperative pelvic floor muscle training in improving the recovery of continence after radical prostatectomy: a randomized controlled trial.', 'Long-term effect of early postoperative pelvic floor biofeedback on continence in men undergoing radical prostatectomy: a prospective, randomized, controlled trial.', 'Influence of preoperative and postoperative pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) compared with postoperative PFMT on urinary incontinence after radical prostatectomy: a randomized controlled trial.', 'Effects of perioperative pelvic floor muscle training on early recovery of urinary continence and erectile function in men undergoing radical prostatectomy: a randomized clinical trial.', 'Safety and outcome of early catheter removal after radical retropubic prostatectomy.', 'Conservative management for postprostatectomy urinary incontinence.', 'Efficacy and safety of mirabegron in the treatment of overactive bladder syndrome after radical prostatectomy: a prospective randomized controlled study.', 'Physiotherapy as an Effective Method to Support the Treatment of Male Urinary Incontinence: A Systematic Review.', 'How to Predict Outcomes from a Biofeedback and Pelvic Floor Muscle Electric Stimulation Program in Patients with Urinary Incontinence after Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Acupuncture for prostatectomy incontinence: study protocol for a multicenter single-blind randomized parallel controlled trial.', 'Preoperative exercise interventions to optimize continence outcomes following radical prostatectomy.']"""

Patients and methods:   Between August 2006 and August 2010, 116 patients undergoing RALP for clinically localized PCa had baseline and 1-year Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) questionnaire data obtained. Patients were divided into three groups with respect to nocturia: N1 (0 or 1 episode per night), N2 (2 episodes per night), and N3 (3 or more episodes per night).  Results:   N1 (63 patients) had stable or worsened nocturia with 78% of patients retaining their N1 status, 21% progressed to N2 status, and 2% progressed to N3. N2 (29 patients) were 52% N1, 34% N2, and 14% N3 after surgery. The N3 (24 patients) had 29% improved to N1, 38% improved to N2, and 33% remained N3.

Subjects were women aged 55-74 at baseline from the screening arm of the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial. Incident breast cancers were identified through annual health surveys. Controls were frequency matched to cases by age and year of entry into the trial. A self-administered food frequency questionnaire queried frequency and usual serving size of beer, wine or wine coolers, and liquor. Three SNPs in genes in the alcohol metabolism pathway were genotyped: alcohol dehydrogenase 2, alcohol dehydrogenase 3, and CYP2E1. The study included 1,041 incident breast cancer cases and 1,070 controls. In comparison to non-drinkers, the intake of any alcohol significantly increased the risk of breast cancer, and this risk increased with each category of daily alcohol intake (OR 2.01, 95% CI 1.14, 3.53) for women who drank three or more standard drinks per day. Stratification by genotype revealed significant gene/environment interactions. For the ADH1B gene, there were statistically significant associations between all levels of alcohol intake and risk of breast cancer (all OR > 1.34 and all lower CI > 1.01), while for women with the GA or AA genotype, there were no significant associations between alcohol intake and risk of breast cancer. Alcohol intake, genes involved in alcohol metabolism and their interaction increase the risk of breast cancer in post-menopausal women.

Methods and materials:   This retrospective study was HIPAA compliant and approved by our Committee on Human Research. We identified all patients in our institutional prostate cancer database (1996 onward) who underwent endorectal MR imaging and MR spectroscopic imaging before radiotherapy for biopsy-proven prostate cancer and again at least 2 years after radiotherapy (n = 124). Two radiologists recorded the presence, location, and size of unequivocal dominant tumor on pre- and postradiotherapy scans. Recurrent tumor was considered to be at the same location as the baseline tumor if at least 50% of the tumor location overlapped. Clinical and biopsy data were collected from all patients.  Results:   Nine patients had unequivocal dominant tumor on both pre- and postradiotherapy imaging, with mean pre- and postradiotherapy dominant tumor diameters of 1.8 cm (range, 1-2.2) and 1.9 cm (range, 1.4-2.6), respectively.

Methods and materials:   We conducted a retrospective claims-based analysis of the use of radiation therapy, surgery, and androgen deprivation therapy in the 12 months after diagnosis of prostate cancer in a nationally representative 5% sample of Medicare claims. Patients were Medicare beneficiaries 67 years or older with incident prostate cancer diagnosed between 1999 and 2007.  Results:   There were 20,918 incident cases of prostate cancer between 1999 and 2007. The proportion of patients receiving androgen deprivation therapy decreased from 55% to 36%, and the proportion of patients receiving no active therapy increased from 16% to 23%. Intensity-modulated radiation therapy replaced three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy as the most common method of radiation therapy, accounting for 77% of external beam radiotherapy by 2007. Minimally invasive radical prostatectomy began to replace open surgical approaches, being used in 49% of radical prostatectomies by 2007.  Conclusions:   Between 2002 and 2007, the use of androgen deprivation therapy decreased, open surgical approaches were largely replaced by minimally invasive radical prostatectomy, and intensity-modulated radiation therapy replaced three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy as the predominant method of radiation therapy in the Medicare population.

This Phase II trial was performed to document late gastrointestinal or genitourinary toxicity as well as biochemical control for this treatment in a multi-institutional cooperative group setting. This report defines the long-term results of this trial.  Methods and materials:   All eligible patients received external-beam radiation (45 Gy in 25 fractions) followed 2-6 weeks later by a permanent iodine 125 implant of 108 Gy. Late toxicity was defined by the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group/European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer late radiation morbidity scoring scheme. Biochemical control was defined by the American Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology (ASTRO) Consensus definition and the ASTRO Phoenix definition.  Results:   One hundred thirty-eight patients were enrolled from 20 institutions, and 131 were eligible. Median follow-up (living patients) was 8.2 years (range, 2.7-9.3 years). The 8-year estimate of late grade >3 genitourinary and/or gastrointestinal toxicity was 15%. The most common grade >3 toxicities were urinary frequency, dysuria, and proctitis. There were two grade 4 toxicities, both bladder necrosis, and no grade 5 toxicities. In addition, 42% of patients complained of grade 3 impotence (no erections) at 8 years. The 8-year estimate of biochemical failure was 18% and 21% by the Phoenix and ASTRO consensus definitions, respectively.  Conclusion:   Biochemical control for this treatment seems durable with 8 years of follow-up and is similar to high-dose external beam radiation alone or brachytherapy alone. Late toxicity in this multi-institutional trial is higher than reports from similar cohorts of patients treated with high-dose external-beam radiation alone or permanent low-doserate brachytherapy alone, perhaps suggesting further attention to strategies that limit doses to normal structures or to unimodal radiotherapy techniques.""","""['Colleen A Lawton', 'Yan Yan', 'W Robert Lee', 'Michael Gillin', 'Selim Firat', 'Madhava Baikadi', 'Juanita Crook', 'Michael Kuettel', 'Gerald Morton', 'Howard Sandler']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Re: Long-term results of an RTOG phase II trial (00-19) of external-beam radiation therapy combined with permanent source brachytherapy for intermediate-risk clinically localized adenocarcinoma of the prostate.', 'A phase II study of external beam radiotherapy combined with permanent source brachytherapy for intermediate-risk, clinically localized adenocarcinoma of the prostate: preliminary results of RTOG P-0019.', 'Late toxicity and biochemical recurrence after external-beam radiotherapy combined with permanent-source prostate brachytherapy: analysis of Radiation Therapy Oncology Group study 0019.', 'High-dose-rate brachytherapy as a monotherapy for favorable-risk prostate cancer: a Phase II trial.', ""High-dose-rate intensity-modulated brachytherapy with external beam radiotherapy for prostate cancer: California endocurietherapy's 10-year results."", 'Management of localised prostate cancer: watchful waiting, surgery or radiation therapy, depending on the natural course, which is often relatively slow.', 'Real-world utilisation of brachytherapy boost and patient-reported functional outcomes in men who had external beam radiation therapy for prostate cancer in Australia.', 'Long-Term Results of NRG Oncology/RTOG 0321: A Phase II Trial of Combined High Dose Rate Brachytherapy and External Beam Radiation Therapy for Adenocarcinoma of the Prostate.', 'Impact of real-time, dose-escalated permanent seed implant brachytherapy in intermediate-risk prostate cancer.', 'A comparison of outcomes for patients with intermediate and high risk prostate cancer treated with low dose rate and high dose rate brachytherapy in combination with external beam radiotherapy.', 'Clinical outcomes of 125I brachytherapy with and without external-beam radiation therapy for localized prostate cancer: results from 300 patients at a single institution in Japan.']"""

Materials and methods:   Between 2008 and 2009, 186 patients with prostate cancer were treated with IGRT to a dose of 86.4 Gy with daily correction of the target position based on kilovoltage imaging of implanted prostatic fiducial markers. This group of patients was retrospectively compared with a similar cohort of 190 patients who were treated between 2006 and 2007 with IMRT to the same prescription dose without, however, implanted fiducial markers in place (non-IGRT). The median follow-up time was 2.8 years (range, 2-6 years).  Results:   A significant reduction in late urinary toxicity was observed for IGRT patients compared with the non-IGRT patients. The 3-year likelihood of grade 2 and higher urinary toxicity for the IGRT and non-IGRT cohorts were 10.4% and 20.0%, respectively (p = 0.02). Multivariate analysis identifying predictors for grade 2 or higher late urinary toxicity demonstrated that, in addition to the baseline Internatinoal Prostate Symptom Score, IGRT was associated with significantly less late urinary toxicity compared with non-IGRT. The incidence of grade 2 and higher rectal toxicity was low for both treatment groups (1.0% and 1.6%, respectively; p = 0.81). No differences in prostate-specific antigen relapse-free survival outcomes were observed for low- and intermediate-risk patients when treated with IGRT and non-IGRT. For high-risk patients, a significant improvement was observed at 3 years for patients treated with IGRT compared with non-IGRT.  Conclusions:   IGRT is associated with an improvement in biochemical tumor control among high-risk patients and a lower rate of late urinary toxicity compared with high-dose IMRT.

Adaptive planning using a combined MRI-linear accelerator approach will also require dose calculations to be performed using MRI data. The aim of this work was to develop an atlas-based method to map realistic electron densities to MRI scans for dose calculations and digitally reconstructed radiograph (DRR) generation.  Methods and materials:   Whole-pelvis MRI and CT scan data were collected from 39 prostate patients. Scans from 2 patients showed significantly different anatomy from that of the remaining patient population, and these patients were excluded. A whole-pelvis MRI atlas was generated based on the manually delineated MRI scans. In addition, a conjugate electron-density atlas was generated from the coregistered computed tomography (CT)-MRI scans. Pseudo-CT scans for each patient were automatically generated by global and nonrigid registration of the MRI atlas to the patient MRI scan, followed by application of the same transformations to the electron-density atlas. Comparisons were made between organ segmentations by using the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and point dose calculations for 26 patients on planning CT and pseudo-CT scans.  Results:   The agreement between pseudo-CT and planning CT was quantified by differences in the point dose at isocenter and distance to agreement in corresponding voxels. Dose differences were found to be less than 2%. Chi-squared values indicated that the planning CT and pseudo-CT dose distributions were equivalent. No significant differences (p > 0.9) were found between CT and pseudo-CT Hounsfield units for organs of interest. Mean ± standard deviation DSC scores for the atlas-based segmentation of the pelvic bones were 0.79 ± 0.12, 0.70 ± 0.14 for the prostate, 0.64 ± 0.16 for the bladder, and 0.63 ± 0.16 for the rectum.

However, there are limited data on the effect of this treatment on cancer-specific mortality (CSM). Our objective was to test the relationship between radiotherapy and survival in men with localized PCa and compare it with those treated with observation.  Methods:   A population-based cohort identified 68,797 men with cT1-T2 PCa treated with radiotherapy or observation between the years 1992 and 2005. Propensity-score matching was used to minimize potential bias related to treatment assignment. Competing-risks analyses tested the effect of treatment type (radiotherapy vs. observation) on CSM, after accounting to other-cause mortality. All analyses were carried out within PCa risk, baseline comorbidity status, and age groups.  Results:   Radiotherapy was associated with more favorable 10-year CSM rates than observation in patients with high-risk PCa (8.8 vs. 14.4%, hazard ratio [HR]: 0.59, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.50-0.68). Conversely, the beneficial effect of radiotherapy on CSM was not evident in patients with low-intermediate risk PCa (3.7 vs. 4.1%, HR: 0.91, 95% CI: 0.80-1.04). Radiotherapy was beneficial in elderly patients (5.6 vs. 7.3%, HR: 0.70, 95% CI: 0.59-0.80).

In the A-P direction, target motion was twice as likely to move posteriorly, toward the rectum, than anteriorly. Fifteen percent of all treatments were interrupted for repositioning, and 70% of patients were repositioned at least once during their treatment course.  Conclusion:   Set-up errors and motion of the prostatic fossa during radiotherapy are nontrivial, leading to potential undertreatment of target and excess normal tissue toxicity if not taken into account during treatment planning. Localization and real-time tracking of the prostate bed via implanted Calypso transponders can be used to improve the accuracy of plan delivery.""","""['Tracy Klayton', 'Robert Price', 'Mark K Buyyounouski', 'Mark Sobczak', 'Richard Greenberg', 'Jinsheng Li', 'Lanea Keller', 'Dennis Sopka', 'Alexander Kutikov', 'Eric M Horwitz']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Assessment of planning target volume margins for intensity-modulated radiotherapy of the prostate gland: role of daily inter- and intrafraction motion.', 'Prostate and patient intrafraction motion: impact on treatment time-dependent planning margins for patients with endorectal balloon.', 'Adaptive radiation therapy for postprostatectomy patients using real-time electromagnetic target motion tracking during external beam radiation therapy.', 'A review of artificial intelligence applications for motion tracking in radiotherapy.', 'Rationale and development of image-guided intensity-modulated radiotherapy post-prostatectomy: the present standard of care?', 'Evaluation of Dose-Painting in the Dominant Intraprostatic Lesions by Radiobiological Parameters using 68Ga- PSMA PET/CT.', '68Ga-PSMA-PET screening and transponder-guided salvage radiotherapy to the prostate bed alone for biochemical recurrence following prostatectomy: interim outcomes of a phase II trial.', 'Evaluation of the XVI dual registration tool for image-guided radiotherapy in prostate cancer.', 'Intra-fraction displacement of the prostate bed during post-prostatectomy radiotherapy.', 'Volumetric and Voxel-Wise Analysis of Dominant Intraprostatic Lesions on Multiparametric MRI.']"""

We investigated N-telopeptide of type I collagen (NTX) and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BAP) as potential predictors of ONJ onset.  Patients and methods:   Patients with ONJ and available stored serum were identified retrospectively from the institutional databases. Four approximate points were examined: point of ONJ diagnosis and 12, 6, and 1 month before the diagnosis. NTX and BAP were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and examined as possible predictors of ONJ.  Results:   From March 1998 to September 2009, we identified 122 patients with ONJ. Of these, 56 (46%) had one or more serum samples available. Overall, 55 patients (98%) received bisphosphonates. Using the exact dates, no obvious patterns in either NTX or BAP were noted. Similarly, using the ordinal points, no evidence of suppression of NTX or BAP over time was seen. The consecutive median values were as follows: The median NTX values were 8.0 nmol/L (range 3.8 to 32.9) at 12 months before ONJ; 9.5 nmol/L (range 4.7 to 42.7) at 6 months; 9.5 nmol/L (range 4.5 to 24.6) at 1 month, and 10.4 nmol/L (range 4.4 to 32.5) at the ONJ diagnosis. The median BAP values were BAP 18.0 U/L (range 7.0 to 74) at 12 months before ONJ; 18.0 U/L (range 4.0 to 134) at 6 months; 14.0 U/L (range 4.0 to 132) at 1 month, and 18.0 U/L (range 0.7 to 375) at the ONJ diagnosis.

The Set and RING-finger-associated domain-containing protein UHRF1 might be an important link between different epigenetic pathways. Here, we report that UHRF1 is frequently overexpressed in human prostate tumours and has an important role in prostate cancer pathogenesis and progression. Analysis of human prostate cancer samples by microarrays and immunohistochemistry showed increased expression of UHRF1 in about half of the cases. Moreover, UHRF1 expression was associated with reduced overall survival after prostatectomy in patients with organ-confined prostate tumours (P < 0.0001). UHRF1 expression was negatively correlated with several tumour suppressor genes and positively with the histone methyltransferase (HMT) EZH2 both in prostate tumours and cell lines. UHRF1 knockdown reduced proliferation, clonogenic capability and anchorage-independent growth of prostate cancer cells. Depletion of UHRF1 resulted in reactivation of several tumour suppressor genes. Gene reactivation upon UHRF1 depletion was associated with changes in histone H3K9 methylation, acetylation and DNA methylation, and impaired binding of the H3K9 HMT Suv39H1 to the promoter of silenced genes. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed direct interaction between UHRF1 and Suv39H1. Our data support the notion that UHRF1, along with Suv39H1 and DNA methyltransferases, contributes to epigenetic gene silencing in prostate tumours. This could represent a parallel and convergent pathway to the H3K27 methylation catalyzed by EZH2 to synergistically promote inactivation of tumour suppressor genes. Deregulated expression of UHRF1 is involved in the prostate cancer pathogenesis and might represent a useful marker to distinguish indolent cancer from those at high risk of lethal progression.""","""['F Babbio', 'C Pistore', 'L Curti', 'I Castiglioni', 'P Kunderfranco', 'L Brino', 'P Oudet', 'R Seiler', 'G N Thalman', 'E Roggero', 'M Sarti', 'S Pinton', 'M Mello-Grand', 'G Chiorino', 'C V Catapano', 'G M Carbone', 'I M Bonapace']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['UHRF1 is associated with epigenetic silencing of BRCA1 in sporadic breast cancer.', 'Gene silencing in cancer by histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation independent of promoter DNA methylation.', 'Overexpression of UHRF1 promotes silencing of tumor suppressor genes and predicts outcome in hepatoblastoma.', 'Signalling pathways in UHRF1-dependent regulation of tumor suppressor genes in cancer.', 'Down-regulation of UHRF1, associated with re-expression of tumor suppressor genes, is a common feature of natural compounds exhibiting anti-cancer properties.', 'UHRF1 is a mediator of KRAS driven oncogenesis in lung adenocarcinoma.', 'PIP4K2B is mechanoresponsive and controls heterochromatin-driven nuclear softening through UHRF1.', 'UHRF1-induced connexin26 methylation is involved in hearing damage triggered by intermittent hypoxia in neonatal rats.', 'Histone lysine methylation patterns in prostate cancer microenvironment infiltration: Integrated bioinformatic analysis and histological validation.', 'Novel UHRF1-MYC Axis in Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia.']"""

Responses were tabulated and descriptive statistics are reported.  Results:   Sixty-five brachytherapy practitioners responded to the survey. Eighty-nine percent (89%) of respondents performed LDR and 49% perform high-dose-rate brachytherapy. The median number of years of experience for LDR brachytherapists increased from 5 to 10 years over the course of the 12 years since the preceding survey. Compared with the first ABS, a smaller proportion of respondents received formal brachytherapy residency training (43% vs. 56%) or formal ""hands-on"" brachytherapy training (15% vs. 63%). There has been a marked decline in the utilization of the Mick applicator (Mick Radio-Nuclear Instruments, Inc., Mount Vernon, NY, USA) (60% vs. 28%) and an increase in the use of stranded seeds (40% vs. 11%).

Methods and materials:   A total of 245 patients who received (125)I prostate brachytherapy with or without external beam radiotherapy were enrolled. For postimplant analysis, CT and MRI scans were obtained at 1 month after seed implantation. For MRI-based dosimetry, T2-weighted images were fused with the CE-T1WI; the prostate was delineated on the T2-weighted images, and the seed detection was performed manually on the CE-T1WI. In CT-based dosimetry, the seed detection was essentially performed automatically. The dosimetric results obtained by MRI-based and CT-based dosimetry were compared.  Results:   The mean prostate D(90) (the minimum dose received by 90% of the prostate volume) estimated by MRI-based and CT-based dosimetry were 113% and 115%, respectively, with no significant difference. The mean prostate V(100) (the percent volume of the postimplant prostate receiving 100% of the prescribed dose) estimated by MRI-based and CT-based dosimetry were 95.2% and 95.8%, respectively, again with no significant difference. The mean prostate V(150) (the percent volume of the postimplant prostate receiving 150% of the prescribed dose) estimated by MRI-based and CT-based dosimetry were 52.8% and 57.0%, respectively (p<0.01). In all of the 35 patients (14%) in whom the MRI-based V(150) were at least 10% lower than the CT-based results, the seed detection by CT-based dosimetry was overestimated in highly seed-clustered areas or in the areas close to calcifications because of reconstruction artifacts in CT images.

This study consisted of 50 women with breast benign tumors and 50 malignant (invasive) tumors.

However, whether tumor aggressiveness is driven by CSC and by what extent this property may be relevant within the tumor mass is still unsettled. To address this issue, we isolated a rare tumor cell population on the basis of its CD44(+)CD24(-) phenotype from the human androgen-independent prostate carcinoma cell line DU145 and established its CSC properties. The behavior of selected CSC was investigated with respect to the bulk DU145 cells. The injection of CSC in nude mice generated highly vascularized tumors infiltrating the adjacent tissues, showing high density of neuroendocrine cells and expressing low levels of E-cadherin and β-catenin as well as high levels of vimentin. On the contrary, when a comparable number of unsorted DU145 cells were injected the resulting tumors were less aggressive. To investigate the different features of tumors in vivo, the influence of differentiated tumor cells on CSC was examined in vitro by growing CSC in the absence or presence of conditioned medium from DU145 cells. CSC grown in permissive conditions differentiated into cell populations with features similar to those of cells held in aggressive tumors generated from CSC injection. Differently, conditioned medium induced CSC to differentiate into a cell phenotype comparable to cells of scarcely aggressive tumors originated from bulk DU145 cell injection. These findings show for the first time that CSC are able to generate differentiated cells expressing either highly or scarcely aggressive phenotype, thus influencing prostate cancer progression. The fate of CSC was determined by signals released from tumor environment. Moreover, using microarray analysis we selected some molecules which could be involved in this cell-to-cell signaling, hypothesizing their potential value for prognostic or therapeutic applications.""","""['Luisa Salvatori', 'Francesca Caporuscio', 'Alessandra Verdina', 'Giuseppe Starace', 'Stefania Crispi', 'Maria Rita Nicotra', 'Andrea Russo', 'Raffaele Adolfo Calogero', 'Emanuela Morgante', 'Pier Giorgio Natali', 'Matteo Antonio Russo', 'Elisa Petrangeli']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Radiation-induced glucocorticoid receptor promotes CD44+ prostate cancer stem cell growth through activation of SGK1-Wnt/β-catenin signaling.', 'CD44+ CD24(-) prostate cells are early cancer progenitor/stem cells that provide a model for patients with poor prognosis.', 'CD133+, CD166+CD44+, and CD24+CD44+ phenotypes fail to reliably identify cell populations with cancer stem cell functional features in established human colorectal cancer cell lines.', 'More than markers: biological significance of cancer stem cell-defining molecules.', 'Breast cancer stem cells and intrinsic subtypes: controversies rage on.', 'CgB promotes EMT and stemness via MAPK pathway in colonic neuroendocrine carcinoma.', 'DNA-GEL, Novel Nanomaterial for Biomedical Applications and Delivery of Bioactive Molecules.', 'High Skp2 expression is associated with a mesenchymal phenotype and increased tumorigenic potential of prostate cancer cells.', 'RNA sequencing reveals upregulation of a transcriptomic program associated with stemness in metastatic prostate cancer cells selected for taxane resistance.', 'Identification of an IL-1-induced gene expression pattern in AR+ PCa cells that mimics the molecular phenotype of AR- PCa cells.']"""

All cancers were incident, histologically confirmed; controls were subjects admitted to the same network of hospitals as cases for a wide spectrum of acute nonneoplastic conditions.  Results:   The multivariate odds ratio (OR) for consumption of cruciferous vegetables at least once a week as compared with no/occasional consumption was significantly reduced for cancer of the oral cavity/pharynx (OR=0.83), esophagus (OR=0.72), colorectum (OR=0.83), breast (OR=0.83), and kidney (OR=0.68). The OR was below unity, but not significant, for stomach (OR=0.90), liver (OR=0.72), pancreatic (OR=0.90), laryngeal (OR=0.84), endometrial (OR=0.93), ovarian (OR=0.91), and prostate (OR=0.87) cancer.  Conclusion:   This large series of studies provides additional evidence of a favorable effect of cruciferous vegetables on several common cancers.""","""['C Bosetti', 'M Filomeno', 'P Riso', 'J Polesel', 'F Levi', 'R Talamini', 'M Montella', 'E Negri', 'S Franceschi', 'C La Vecchia']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Ann Oncol""","""['Vegetable and fruit consumption and cancer risk.', 'Fish consumption and cancer risk.', 'Dietary acrylamide and human cancer.', 'Conference on ""Multidisciplinary approaches to nutritional problems"".

However, improvements are required in therapies against TRAIL-resistant tumor cells. We report, here, that the anti-obesity drug orlistat enhances the sensitivity to TRAIL in hormone-refractory prostate cancer (HRPC) cells through two different pathways. The combination of orlistat and TRAIL remarkably induced apoptosis in TRAIL-resistant HRPC, DU145 and PC3 cells. Orlistat induced the expression of death receptor (DR) 5, which is one of the TRAIL receptors, at both the mRNA and protein levels. The suppression of DR5 with siRNA reduced the apoptosis induced by the combination of orlistat and TRAIL, suggesting that the apoptosis was at least partially due to the upregulation of DR5. Although the upregulation by orlistat of CHOP at both mRNA and protein levels was observed in both cell lines, the activation of the DR5 promoter in DU145 cells was CHOP-dependent, but that in PC3 cells was CHOP-independent. Moreover, orlistat induced reactive oxygen species (ROS), and a ROS scavenger diminished the sensitivity to TRAIL through the suppression of CHOP and DR5 expression in both cell lines. These results suggest that there are two pathways of upregulation of DR5 by orlistat, which are the ROS-CHOP pathway and the ROS-direct pathway. In conclusion, orlistat promotes the sensitivity to TRAIL by ROS-mediated pathways in prostate cancer cells, especially in TRAIL-resistant cells. We believe that the combination of orlistat and TRAIL in HRPC is promising as a new chemotherapeutic strategy.""","""['Jun Fujiwara', 'Yoshihiro Sowa', 'Mano Horinaka', 'Makoto Koyama', 'Miki Wakada', 'Tsuneharu Miki', 'Toshiyuki Sakai']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Int J Oncol""","""['The anti-obesity drug orlistat promotes sensitivity to TRAIL by two different pathways in hormone-refractory prostate cancer cells.', 'Anti-gout agent allopurinol exerts cytotoxicity to human hormone-refractory prostate cancer cells in combination with tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand.', 'Baicalein overcomes tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand resistance via two different cell-specific pathways in cancer cells but not in normal cells.', 'Tunicamycin enhances tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand-induced apoptosis in human prostate cancer cells.', 'Anticancer drugs for the modulation of endoplasmic reticulum stress and oxidative stress.', 'Intracellular localization of DR5 and related regulatory pathways as a mechanism of resistance to TRAIL in cancer.', 'Pharmacological Small Molecules against Prostate Cancer by Enhancing Function of Death Receptor 5.', 'Lipid Metabolism and Resistance to Anticancer Treatment.', 'Anti-Tumorigenic Potential of a Novel Orlistat-AICAR Combination in Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Effects of Fatty Acid Synthase Inhibition by Orlistat on Proliferation of Endometrial Cancer Cell Lines.', 'Ethanolic extract of Descurainia sophia seeds sensitizes A549 human lung cancer cells to TRAIL cytotoxicity by upregulating death receptors.']"""

Further, we examined whether there was a coincident change in the proportion of men potentially suitable for focal therapy.  Methods:   All cancer foci in 195 whole mount radical prostatectomy samples during two periods (Period 1: 07/2001-10/2003, n = 100 and Period 2: 01/2007-11/2009, n = 95) were examined. Individual tumor volumes, Gleason grade, and extracapsular extension/positive surgical margins were evaluated. The index lesion was defined as the largest by volume.  Results:   There was a statistically significant increase in the proportion of Gleason score ≥7 tumors (31-69%; P < 0.001) and pathologically non-organ confined disease (21-37%; P = 0.008), between period 1 and 2, respectively. The proportion of patients with unifocal prostate cancer potentially suitable for focal ablation was stable (14-13.7%; P = 0.9). Although there was a decrease in the proportion of patients potentially suitable for index lesion ablation (51-43%; P = 0.4) and unilateral prostate cancer potentially suitable for hemi-ablation (11-6.3%; P = 0.3), these differences were not statistically significant.  Conclusion:   The increasing use of active surveillance in the UK may be responsible for a trend towards higher grade and stage prostate cancer in whole mount specimens. Despite this, there remain a significant proportion of men who currently undergo radical surgery who may be suitable for focal therapy, if that included index lesion ablation.""","""['Markos Karavitakis', 'Hashim U Ahmed', 'Paul D Abel', 'Naomi Livni', 'Steven Hazell', 'Mathias H Winkler']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Pathological parameters of radical prostatectomy for clinical stages T1c versus T2 prostate adenocarcinoma: decreased pathological stage and increased detection of transition zone tumors.', 'Trends in Radical Prostatectomy Risk Group Distribution in a European Multicenter Analysis of 28 572 Patients: Towards Tailored Treatment.', 'A pathological reassessment of organ-confined, Gleason score 6 prostatic adenocarcinomas that progress after radical prostatectomy.', 'Management of localised prostate cancer: watchful waiting, surgery or radiation therapy, depending on the natural course, which is often relatively slow.', 'An evidence review of active surveillance in men with localized prostate cancer.']"""

In the present study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms involved in the effect of formononetin on prostate cancer cells. Our results suggested that higher concentrations of formononetin inhibited the proliferation of prostate cancer cells (LNCaP and PC-3), while the most striking effect was observed in LNCaP cells. We further found that formononetin inactivated extracellular signal-regulated kinase1/2 (ERK1/2) mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway in a dose-dependent manner, which resulted in increased the expression levels of BCL2-associated X (Bax) mRNA and protein, and induced apoptosis in LNCaP cells. Thus, we concluded that the induced apoptosis effect of formononetin on human prostate cancer cells was related to ERK1/2 MAPK-Bax pathway.

The microneedle array is molded out of polylactic acid. Electrodes and circuitry required for electroporation are applied to the microneedle array surface by a new metal-transfer micromolding method. The microneedle array maintains mechanical integrity after insertion into pig cadaver skin and is able to electroporate human prostate cancer cells in vitro. Quantitative measurements show that increasing electroporation pulse voltage increases uptake efficiency of calcein and bovine serum albumin, whereas increasing pulse length has lesser effects over the range studied. Uptake of molecules by up to 50% of cells and transfection of 12% of cells with a gene for green fluorescent protein is demonstrated at high cell viability.

It has therefore become necessary to precisely track tumour position in order to minimise geometrical uncertainties due to setup errors and organ motion. We conducted this prospective evaluation of prostate cancer patients treated with image-guided conformal radiation therapy at our institution. We implanted three fiducial markers (gold seeds) within the prostatic gland in order to quantify daily target displacements and to generate specific margins around the clinical target volume (CTV) to create an appropriate planned target volume (PTV).  Materials and methods:   Between April and December 2009, ten patients affected with localised prostate cancer were transrectally implanted with three radio-opaque markers. Each patient underwent a computed tomography (CT) scan for planning purposes following proper bladder and rectum preparation. During treatment two orthogonal images were acquired daily and compared with previously generated digitally reconstructed radiographs. After manual localisation, comparison between the position of the gold seeds on the portal and reference images was carried out, and a set of extrapolated lateral-lateral (LL), anterior-posterior (AP) and cranial-caudal (CC) shift corrections was calculated and recorded. Couch corrections were applied with a threshold of 3 mm displacement.  Results:   Systematic and random errors for each direction were calculated either as measured according to displacement of the gold seeds prior to any couch movement and after couch position correction according to the radio-opaque markers. For skin marks, mean systematic and random errors were 0.12+2.94 mm for LL, 1.04+3.37 mm for AP, -1.14+2.71 mm for CC, whereas for seed markers, mean and systematic errors were 0.6+1.5 mm for LL, 0.51+2.45 mm for AP and -0.25+2.51 mm for CC. A scatter plot generated on all measurements after couch repositioning according to gold-seed displacement suggested a confidence range of shift distributions within 5 mm for LL, 8 mm for CC, and 7 mm for AP. The total systematic and random components were then used to calculate proper PTV in patients receiving conventional treatment (7 mm for LL and 9 mm for both AP and CC).  Conclusions:   Prostate positional variability during a course of radiation treatment is strongly influenced by setup and organ motion. Organ tracking through fiducial markers and electronic portal imaging is able to reduce the spread of displacements, significantly contributing to improve the ballistic precision of radiation delivery.""","""['F Munoz', 'C Fiandra', 'P Franco', 'A Guarneri', 'P Ciammella', 'P De Stefanis', 'N Rondi', 'F Moretto', 'S Badellino', 'C Iftode', 'R Ragona', 'U Ricardi']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Radiol Med""","""['Portal imaging protocol for radical dose-escalated radiotherapy treatment of prostate cancer.', 'Potentials of on-line repositioning based on implanted fiducial markers and electronic portal imaging in prostate cancer radiotherapy.', 'Daily CT localization for correcting portal errors in the treatment of prostate cancer.', 'Pediatric radiotherapy for thoracic and abdominal targets: Organ motion, reported margin sizes, and delineation variations - A systematic review.', 'Planning target volume : Management of uncertainties, immobilization, image guided and adaptive radiation therapy.', 'A comparison of robotic arm versus gantry linear accelerator stereotactic body radiation therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Analysis of Geometric Shifts and Proper Setup-Margin in Prostate Cancer Patients Treated With Pelvic Intensity-Modulated Radiotherapy Using Endorectal Ballooning and Daily Enema for Prostate Immobilization.', 'Displacements of fiducial markers in patients with prostate cancer treated with image guided radiotherapy: A single-institution descriptive study.', ""Impact of the observers' experience on daily prostate localization accuracy in ultrasound-based IGRT with the Clarity platform.""]"""

Ipilimumab is an antagonistic monoclonal antibody that binds cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4, an immunomodulatory molecule expressed by activated T cells, and to CD80 on antigen-presenting cells. We aimed to assess the safety and tolerability of ipilimumab in combination with a poxviral-based vaccine targeting prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and containing transgenes for T-cell co-stimulatory molecule expression, including CD80.  Methods:   We did a phase 1 dose-escalation trial, with a subsequent expansion phase, to assess the safety and tolerability of escalating doses of ipilimumab in combination with a fixed dose of the PSA-Tricom vaccine. Patients with mCRPC received 2×10(8) plaque-forming units of recombinant vaccinia PSA-Tricom subcutaneously on day 1 of cycle 1, with subsequent monthly boosts of 1×10(9) plaque-forming units, starting on day 15.

Findings:   We completed enrolment with 30 patients (24 of whom had not been previously treated with chemotherapy) and we did not identify any dose-limiting toxic effects. Grade 1 and 2 vaccination-site reactions were the most common toxic effects: three of 30 patients had grade 1 reactions and 26 had grade 2 reactions. 21 patients had grade 2 or greater immune-related adverse events.

We aimed to assess the safety of combined treatment with GVAX and ipilimumab in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).  Methods:   We did an open-labelled, single-centre, dose-escalation study of ipilimumab concurrent with a fixed dose of GVAX, with a subsequent expansion phase, both at the VU University Medical Centre (Amsterdam, Netherlands). Eligible patients had documented mCRPC and had not been previously treated with chemotherapy. All patients received a 5×10(8) cell priming dose of GVAX intradermally on day 1 with subsequent intradermal injections of 3×10(8) cells every 2 weeks for 24 weeks. The vaccinations were combined with intravenous ipilimumab every 4 weeks. We enrolled patients in cohorts of three; each cohort received an escalating dose of ipilimumab at 0·3, 1·0, 3·0, or 5·0 mg/kg. Our primary endpoint was safety. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01510288.  Findings:   We enrolled 12 patients into our dose-escalation cohort. We did not record any severe immune-related adverse events at the first two dose levels. At the 3·0 mg/kg dose level, one patient had grade 2 and two patients grade 3 hypophysitis; at the 5·0 mg/kg dose level, two patients had grade 3 hypophysitis and one patient developed grade 4 sarcoid alveolitis (a dose-limiting toxic effect). Due to observed clinical activity and toxic events, we decided to expand the 3·0 mg/kg dose level, rather than enrol a further three patients at the 5·0 mg/kg level. 16 patients were enrolled in the expansion cohort, two of whom developed grade 2 hypophysitis, three colitis (one grade 1 and two grade 2), and one grade 3 hepatitis--all immune-related adverse events. The most common adverse events noted in all 28 patients were injection-site reactions (grade 1-2 events seen in all patients), fatigue (grade 1-2 in 20 patients, grade 3 in two), and pyrexia (grade 1-2 in 15 patients, grade 3 in one). 50% or greater declines in prostate-specific antigen from baseline was recorded in seven patients (25%); all had received 3·0 mg/kg or 5·0 mg/kg ipilimumab.

Objective:   Determine the detection rate of (clinically significant) PCa for MRGB of cancer-suspicious regions (CSRs) on 3-T multiparametric MR imaging (MP-MRI) in patients with elevated PSA and one or more negative TRUS-biopsy sessions.  Design, setting, and participants:   Of 844 patients who underwent 3-T MP-MRI in our referral centre between March 2008 and February 2011, 438 consecutive patients with a PSA >4.0 ng/ml and one negative TRUS-biopsy session or more were included. MRGB was performed in 265 patients. Exclusion criteria were existent PCa, endorectal coil use, and MP-MRI for indications other than cancer detection.  Intervention:   Patients underwent MRGB of MP-MRI CSRs.  Measurements:   (Clinically significant) MRGB cancer-detection rates were determined. Clinically significant cancer was defined by accepted (i.a. Epstein and d'Amico) criteria based on PSA, Gleason score, stage, and tumour volume. Follow-up PSA and histopathology were collected. Sensitivity analysis was performed for patients with MP-MRI CSRs without MRGB.  Results and limitations:   In a total of 117 patients, cancer was detected with MRGB (n=108) or after negative MRGB (n=9). PCa was detected in 108 of 438 patients (25%) and in 41% (108 of 265) of MRGB patients. The majority of detected cancers (87%) were clinically significant. Clinically significant cancers were detected in seven of nine (78%) negative MRGB patients in whom PCa was detected during follow-up. Sensitivity analysis resulted in increased cancer detection (47-56%). Complications occurred in 0.2% of patients (5 of 265).

Central to nuclear factor kappa B regulation is the ubiquitin-proteasome system, pharmacological inhibition of which has been proposed as an anticancer strategy. We investigated the putative role of the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib in neuropeptides signaling effects on prostate cancer cells.  Methods:   Human prostate cancer cell lines, LNCaP and PC-3, were used to examine cell proliferation, levels of proapoptotic (caspase-3, Bad) and cell cycle regulatory proteins (p53, p27, p21), as well as total and phosphorylated Akt and p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase proteins. Furthermore, 20S proteasome activity, subcellular localization of nuclear factor kappa B and transcription of nuclear factor kappa B target genes, interleukin-8 and vascular endothelial growth factor, were assessed.  Results:   Neuropeptides (endothelin-1, bombesin) increased cell proliferation, whereas bortezomib decreased proliferation and induced apoptosis, an effect maintained after cotreatment with neuropeptides. Bad, p53, p21 and p27 were downregulated by neuropeptides in PC-3, and these effects were reversed with the addition of bortezomib. Neuropeptides increased proteasomal activity and nuclear factor kappa B levels in PC-3, and these effects were prevented by bortezomib. Interleukin-8 and vascular endothelial growth factor transcripts were induced after neuropeptides treatment, but downregulated by bortezomib. These results coincided with the ability of bortezomib to reduce mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling in both cell lines.  Conclusions:   These findings are consistent with bortezomib-mediated abrogation of neuropeptides-induced proliferative and antiapoptotic signaling. Thus, the effect of the drug on the neuropeptides axis needs to be further investigated, as neuropeptide action in prostate cancer might entail involvement of the proteasome.""","""['Konstantinos Tsapakidis', 'Panagiotis J Vlachostergios', 'Ioannis A Voutsadakis', 'Christina D Befani', 'Anna Patrikidou', 'Eleana Hatzidaki', 'Danai D Daliani', 'George Moutzouris', 'Panagiotis Liakos', 'Christos N Papandreou']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Int J Urol""","""['Synergistic induction of oxidative injury and apoptosis in human multiple myeloma cells by the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib and histone deacetylase inhibitors.', 'Novel signaling molecules implicated in tumor-associated fatty acid synthase-dependent breast cancer cell proliferation and survival: Role of exogenous dietary fatty acids, p53-p21WAF1/CIP1, ERK1/2 MAPK, p27KIP1, BRCA1, and NF-kappaB.', 'Indole-3-carbinol (I3C) induced cell growth inhibition, G1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in prostate cancer cells.', 'Melatonin as a proteasome inhibitor.

Methods:   Systematic error data collected from 50 patients were used together with a random error of σ=3.0 mm to model non-IGRT treatment. IGRT was modelled with residual errors of Σ=σ=1.5 mm. Population tumour control probability (TCP(pop)) was calculated for two three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy techniques: two-phase and concomitant boost. Treatment volumes and dose prescriptions were ostensibly the same. The relative field sizes of the treatment techniques, distribution of systematic errors and correlations between movement axes were examined.  Results:   The differences in TCP(pop) between the IGRT and non-IGRT regimes were 0.3% for the two-phase and 1.5% for the concomitant boost techniques. A 2-phase plan, in each phase of which the 95% isodose conformed to its respective PTV, required fields that were 3.5 mm larger than those required for the concomitant boost plan. Despite the larger field sizes, the TCP (without IGRT) in the two-phase plan was only 1.7% higher than the TCP in the concomitant boost plan. The deviation of craniocaudal systematic errors (p=0.02) from a normal distribution, and the correlation of translations in the craniocaudal and anteroposterior directions (p<0.0001) were statistically significant.

Materials and methods:   This study used 22 preoperative prostate MRI data sets (16 PZ, 6 CG) acquired from men with confirmed prostate cancer (CaP) and scheduled for radical prostatectomy (RP). The prostate region-of-interest (ROI) was automatically delineated on T2w MRI, following which it was corrected for intensity-based acquisition artifacts. An expert pathologist manually delineated the dominant tumor regions on ex vivo sectioned and stained RP specimens as well as identified each of the studies as either a CG or PZ CaP. A nonlinear registration scheme was used to spatially align and then map CaP extent from the ex vivo RP sections onto the corresponding MRI slices. A total of 110 texture features were then extracted on a per-voxel basis from all T2w MRI data sets. An information theoretic feature selection procedure was then applied to identify QISes comprising T2w MRI textural features specific to CG and PZ CaP, respectively. The QISes for CG and PZ CaP were evaluated by means of Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA) on a per-voxel basis against the ground truth for CaP on T2w MRI, mapped from corresponding histology.  Results:   The QDA classifier yielded an area under the Receiver Operating characteristic curve of 0.86 for the CG CaP studies, and 0.73 for the PZ CaP studies over 25 runs of randomized three-fold cross-validation. By comparison, the accuracy of the QDA classifier was significantly lower when (a) using all 110 texture features (with no feature selection applied), as well as (b) a randomly selected combination of texture features.

In a recent article in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Chang et al. show that, contrary to widely held assumptions, the dominant pathway to DHT synthesis does not involve testosterone as a precursor to DHT, but instead involves the conversion of Δ ( 4) -androstenedione (AD) to 5α-dione (AD→5α-dione→DHT) by the steroid-5α-reductase isoenzyme 1 (SRD5A1). The authors show that it is this alternative pathway that drives the progression of CRPC, and they confirm these findings in six established human prostate cancer cell lines as well as in the metastatic tumors from two patients with CRPC.

Methods:   Outcomes of 2675 men with localised PC treated with RT±ADT from 1987-2007 were analysed. Prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM) and non-PCSM rates were calculated after stratifying patients according to National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) risk-group, RT dose, use of ADT and age at treatment.  Results:   Only 0.2% of low-risk men died of PC 10 years after treatment. All of these deaths occurred in patients treated with < 72 Gy, and only one patient ≥ 70 years old who received ≥ 72 Gy died of PC at last follow-up. Likewise, none of the patients with intermediate-risk disease treated with ≥ 72 Gy and ADT died of PC at 10 years, and the highest 10-year rate of PCSM was seen in men ≥ 70 years old treated with < 72 Gy without ADT (5.1%). Among high-risk men < 70 years old, treatment with RT dose < 72 Gy without ADT yielded similar 10-year rates of PCSM (15.2%) and non-PCSM (18.5%), whereas men treated with ≥ 72 Gy and ADT were twice as likely to die from other causes (16.2%) than PC (9.4%). In high-risk men ≥ 70 years old, dose-escalation with ADT reduced 10-year PCSM from 14% to 4%, and most deaths were due to other causes.

Objective:   To assess the relation of biopsy and RP grade in the largest study to date.  Design, setting, and participants:   A total of 7643 totally embedded RP and corresponding needle biopsies (2004-2010) were analyzed according to the updated Gleason system.  Interventions:   All patients underwent prostate biopsy prior to RP.  Measurements:   The relation of upgrading or downgrading to patient and cancer characteristics was compared using the chi-square test, Student t test, and multivariable logistic regression.  Results and limitations:   A total of 36.3% of cases were upgraded from a needle biopsy GS 5-6 to a higher grade at RP (11.2% with GS 6 plus tertiary). Half of the cases had matching GS 3+4=7 at biopsy and RP with an approximately equal number of cases downgraded and upgraded at RP. With biopsy GS 4+3=7, RP GS was almost equally 3+4=7 and 4+3=7. Biopsy GS 8 led to an almost equal distribution between RP GS 4+3=7, 8, and 9-10. A total of 58% of the cases had matching GS 9-10 at biopsy and RP. In multivariable analysis, increasing age (p<0.0001), increasing serum prostate-specific antigen level (p<0.0001), decreasing RP weight (p<0.0001), and increasing maximum percentage cancer/core (p<0.0001) predicted the upgrade from biopsy GS 5-6 to higher at RP. Despite factoring in multiple variables including the number of positive cores and the maximum percentage of cancer per core, the concordance indexes were not sufficiently high to justify the use of nomograms for predicting upgrading and downgrading for the individual patient.

Objective:   To study the risk of peripheral artery disease (PAD) and venous thromboembolism associated with ADT for PCa.  Design, settings, and participants:   This was a population-based observational study of 182 757 US men ≥ 66 yr of age who were diagnosed with nonmetastatic PCa from 1992 to 2007, with a median follow-up of 5.1 yr, of whom 47.8% received GnRH agonists and 2.2% orchiectomy.  Measurements:   We used Cox proportional hazards models with time-varying treatment variables to adjust for demographic and tumor characteristics in assessing whether treatment with GnRH agonists or orchiectomy were associated with PAD and/or venous thromboembolism.

Sensitivity of outcomes to uncertainties in model parameters was tested.  Results:   For 65-year-old men in average health, surgery resulted in 0.3 additional years of life expectancy, 1.6 additional years of impotence or incontinence and a 4.9% decrease in prostate cancer specific mortality compared to surveillance, for a net difference of 0.05 fewer quality adjusted life years. Increased age and poorer baseline health status favored surveillance. With greater than 95% probability, surveillance resulted in net benefits compared to surgery for age older than 74, 67 and 54 years for men in excellent, average and poor health, respectively. Patient preferences toward life under surveillance, biochemical recurrence of disease, treatment side effects and future discount rate affected optimal management choice.

The primary outcome was the impact of magnetic resonance imaging on identifying patients who were reclassified by confirmatory biopsy as no longer fulfilling active surveillance criteria. We further identified clinical parameters associated with reclassification. The cohort was stratified as patients with 1) normal magnetic resonance imaging, 2) cancer on magnetic resonance imaging concordant with initial biopsy (less than 1 cm) and 3) cancer on magnetic resonance imaging larger than 1 cm. We performed univariate analysis to assess differences in clinical parameters among the groups.  Results:   Magnetic resonance imaging did not detect cancer in 23 cases (38%) while magnetic resonance imaging and initial biopsy were concordant in 24 (40%). Magnetic resonance imaging detected a 1 cm or larger lesion in 13 patients (22%). Of the cases 18 (32.14%) were reclassified. When no cancer was identified on magnetic resonance imaging, only 2 cases (3.5%) were reclassified. The positive and negative predictive values for magnetic resonance imaging predicting reclassification were 83% (95% CI 73-93) and 81% (95% CI 71-91), respectively.

However, it is unknown if survival differences exist among treatments. We analyzed the survival of patients treated with these modalities according to contemporary standards.  Materials and methods:   A total of 10,429 consecutive patients with localized prostate cancer treated with radical prostatectomy (6,485), external beam radiotherapy (2,264) or brachytherapy (1,680) were identified. Multivariable regression analyses were used to model the disease (biopsy grade, clinical stage, prostate specific antigen) and patient specific (age, ethnicity, comorbidity) parameters for overall survival and prostate cancer specific mortality.

Materials and methods:   From the SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results)-Medicare database we identified 52,290 men with incident nonmetastatic prostate cancer from 2000 to 2007 who were treated with radiotherapy. We tracked trends in the use of intensity modulated radiotherapy, 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy, brachytherapy and combinations. Patient demographic and clinical characteristics were described and compared using chi-square and multivariate logistic regression. Trends at the place of service were also examined.  Results:   Intensity modulated radiotherapy use increased from 1% of all radiotherapy in 2000 to 70% in 2007. Three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy use decreased from 75% to 12%. Most cases were treated with intensity modulated radiotherapy monotherapy. In 2007, 12% of the cohort received intensity modulated radiotherapy plus brachytherapy. In 2005, 81% of all external radiation was given as intensity modulated radiotherapy. Except for geography there were minimal differences in patient demographic and clinical characteristics between those treated with 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy vs intensity modulated radiotherapy. On multivariate analysis significant predictors of the odds of receiving intensity modulated radiotherapy vs 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy were low Gleason score, high education, white or Asian race and urban place of residence. The odds of receiving intensity modulated radiotherapy varied greatly by registry. A lesser part of the growth in intensity modulated radiotherapy use occurred at freestanding facilities.  Conclusions:   Intensity modulated radiotherapy has replaced 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy as the primary form of external radiation for prostate cancer. The choice of intensity modulated radiotherapy over 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy is not related to common clinical factors such as age, comorbidities or tumor aggressiveness. Although geographic variations exist, by 2007 intensity modulated radiotherapy dominated in all regions studied.""","""['Sean P Elliott', 'Oluwakayode O Adejoro', 'Badrinath R Konety', 'Stephanie L Jarosek', 'Kathryn E Dusenbery', 'Beth A Virnig']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['High dose radiation delivered by intensity modulated conformal radiotherapy improves the outcome of localized prostate cancer.', 'Intensity-modulated radiotherapy causes fewer side effects than three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy when used in combination with brachytherapy for the treatment of prostate cancer.', 'Predictors of IMRT and conformal radiotherapy use in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma: a SEER-Medicare analysis.', 'Recent developments in radiation oncology-integrating radiation physics and molecular radiobiology advances into clinical radiotherapy practice and beyond.', 'Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT).', 'Race-specific prostate cancer outcomes in a cohort of low and favorable-intermediate risk patients who underwent external beam radiation therapy from 1990 to 2017.', 'Hypofractionated Radiation Therapy for Localized Prostate Cancer: An ASTRO, ASCO, and AUA Evidence-Based Guideline.', 'Locoregional prostate cancer treatment pattern variation in independent cancer centers: policy effect, patient preference, or physician incentive?', 'The natural history and predictors of outcome following biochemical relapse in the dose escalation era for prostate cancer patients undergoing definitive external beam radiotherapy.']"""

Given the high prevalence of smoking and the frequency of prostate specific antigen screening, it is important to determine any association between smoking and prostate specific antigen values using nationally representative data.  Materials and methods:   Included in the final study population were 3,820 men 40 years old or older who participated in the 2001-2006 NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) and met the eligibility criteria for prostate specific antigen testing. The distributions of total, free and percent free prostate specific antigen were estimated by sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. Multivariate linear regression models were fit to determine the adjusted relationship between smoking and total and percent free prostate specific antigen while simultaneously controlling for these characteristics.  Results:   For all ages combined the median total and free prostate specific antigen levels were 0.90 (0.81-0.90) and 0.26 (0.25-0.28) ng/ml, respectively. Multivariate linear regression analysis showed that total prostate specific antigen was 7.9% and 12.2% lower among current and former smokers, respectively, than among never smokers. High body mass index and diabetes were also statistically significantly associated with a lower total prostate specific antigen. Approximately a third of the men had a percent free prostate specific antigen less than 25%. Current smokers had a significantly lower percent free prostate specific antigen than former smokers.  Conclusions:   Our finding that smoking is inversely associated with total prostate specific antigen may have potential implications for the interpretation of prostate specific antigen levels in men who are current or former smokers.

Materials and methods:   We identified 795 patients who underwent 3 or more prostate specific antigen tests before prostate biopsy. Prostate specific antigen velocity was calculated by linear regression and used to assess associations with the risk of prostate cancer overall and of high grade prostate cancer (Gleason score 7-10). We created ROC curves and determined the AUC for several models, including only prostate specific antigen velocity or the last prostate specific antigen measurement before biopsy, to predict prostate cancer and high grade prostate cancer.  Results:   The risk of prostate cancer and high grade prostate cancer increased linearly with increasing prostate specific antigen velocity quartiles (each p trend<0.001). Older patients were more likely to be diagnosed with prostate cancer, given the same prostate specific antigen velocity. In black and Hispanic patients there were strong linear associations between increasing prostate specific antigen velocity and the risk of prostate cancer overall and high grade prostate cancer.

The AUC of models in black and Hispanic patients was significantly higher than in white patients (0.62 and 0.64, respectively, vs 0.47, p=0.03).  Conclusions:   Prostate specific antigen velocity is a significant predictor of prostate cancer and high grade prostate cancer in men with 3 or more prostate specific antigen tests before prostate biopsy.

The enlarged angular space and machine delivery constraints make inverse planning of IMAT more intractable as compared to its counterpart of fixed gantry IMRT. Currently, IMAT inverse planning is being done using two extreme methods: the first one computes in beamlet domain with a subsequent arc leaf sequencing, and the second proceeds in machine parameter domain with entire emphasis placed on a pre-determined delivery method without exploring potentially better alternative delivery schemes. Towards truly optimizing the IMAT treatment on a patient specific basis, in this work we propose a total-variation based inverse planning framework for IMAT, which takes advantage of the useful features of the above two existing approaches while avoiding their shortcomings. A quadratic optimization algorithm has been implemented to demonstrate the performance and advantage of the proposed approach. Applications of the technique to a prostate case and a head and neck case indicate that the algorithm is capable of generating IMAT plans with patient specific numbers of arcs efficiently. Superior dose distributions and delivery time are achieved with a maximum number of apertures of three for each field. As compared to conventional beamlet-based algorithms, our method regularizes the field modulation complexity during optimization, and permits us to obtain the best possible plan with a pre-set modulation complexity of fluences. As illustrated in both prostate and head-and-neck case studies, the proposed method produces more favorable dose distributions than the segment-based algorithms, by optimally accommodating the clinical need of intensity modulation levels for each individual field. On a more fundamental level, our formulation preserves the convexity of optimization and makes the search of the global optimal solution possible with a deterministic method.""","""['Lei Zhu', 'Tianye Niu', 'Kihwan Choi', 'Lei Xing']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Technol Cancer Res Treat""","""['Using total-variation regularization for intensity modulated radiation therapy inverse planning with field-specific numbers of segments.', 'Impact of leaf motion constraints on IMAT plan quality, deliver accuracy, and efficiency.', 'Incorporating geometric ray tracing to generate initial conditions for intensity modulated arc therapy optimization.', 'Intensity-modulated arc therapy: principles, technologies and clinical implementation.', 'Clinical implementation of intensity-modulated arc therapy.', 'Deterministic direct aperture optimization using multiphase piecewise constant segmentation.', 'Toward a planning scheme for emission guided radiation therapy (EGRT): FDG based tumor tracking in a metastatic breast cancer patient.', 'Emission guided radiation therapy for lung and prostate cancers: a feasibility study on a digital patient.']"""

They are intracellular, non-lysosomal cytoplasmic cysteine endopeptidases. Calcium is required for their activation. Their endogenous specific inhibitor is calpastatin, which is expressed ubiquitously and coexists within cells besides calpain. When calcium is present, calpastatin and calpain attach to each other inhibiting the protease. The calpain system plays an important role in many processes including apoptosis, necrosis, ischemia formation and exocytosis. So far, many reports exist on studies about the influence of calpains in different tumors (skin, breast, renal cell and prostate cancers). The role of calpains in pathogenesis or further tumor progression has always been proved in related studies, but their exact function could not be demonstrated. So far, no studies on calpains being involved in the pathogenesis of ovarian cancer have been published. In our study we focused on the expression of the enzymes calpain 1, calpain 2 and their inhibitor calpastatin in normal and malign ovarian tissue. Therefore, we performed immunohistochemical stainings of paraffin slices and evaluated staining intensity (SI), percentage of positive cells (PP) and immunoreactive score (IRS). We evaluated the correlation between enzyme expression in malign and benign ovarian tissues. In malignant ovarian tissue, we found decreased expression, staining intensity and immunoreactive score of calpastatin. With higher grading of the ovarian carcinoma, staining intensity and immunoreactive score of calpain 1 decreased. Staining intensity of calpain 2 in ovarian carcinoma decreased with increasing lymph node status. We clearly demonstrated differences between enzyme expressions in malign and benign tissue. This study could not find any specific function of calpains. Only few studies in the literature have been found that deal with calpain evaluation of ovarian cancer.

The C1 domain of Vav1, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor, plays a critical role in regulation of Vav activity through stabilization of the Dbl homology domain, which is responsible for exchange activity of Vav. Although the C1 domain of Vav1 is classified as atypical, it retains a binding pocket geometry homologous to that of the typical C1 domains of PKCs. This study clarifies the basis for its failure to bind ligands. Substituting Vav1-specific residues into the C1b domain of PKCδ, we identified five crucial residues (Glu(9), Glu(10), Thr(11), Thr(24), and Tyr(26)) along the rim of the binding cleft that weaken binding potency in a cumulative fashion. Reciprocally, replacing these incompatible residues in the Vav1 C1 domain with the corresponding residues from PKCδ C1b (δC1b) conferred high potency for phorbol ester binding. Computer modeling predicts that these unique residues in Vav1 increase the hydrophilicity of the rim of the binding pocket, impairing membrane association and thereby preventing formation of the ternary C1-ligand-membrane binding complex.

Results:   Patients with higher comorbidity burden were more likely to receive systemic treatment for prostate cancer [adjusted odds ratio 1.21, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.05-1.39] but less likely for NSCLC (0.63, 95% CI 0.45-0.86).

To investigate the role of variants in 8q24 region, the authors analyzed data from a prospective study (n = 10,372 participants who were followed for 11 years) in which a large number of health events (>1,500) occurred (1993-1998). They genotyped all subjects for 5 candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs672888, rs1447295, rs9642880, rs16901979, and rs6983267) that were identified in previous genome-wide scans. Although significant associations with individual single nucleotide polymorphisms were small in magnitude, the authors observed higher increases in the risks of different types of cancer with specific haplotypes, particularly when subjects were homozygous for the haplotype: for breast cancer and homozygotes for haplotype CAGCT, hazard ratio = 3.40, 95% confidence interval: 1.24, 9.21; for prostate cancer and grouped rare haplotypes, hazard ratio = 7.43, 95% confidence interval: 3.00, 18.37; and for brain cancer and homozygotes for haplotype CGGCT, hazard ratio = 13.48, 95% confidence interval: 3.00, 59.53. Significant associations were also observed between haplotypes and deaths from cardiovascular diseases and cerebrovascular diseases; the most stable association was between homozygotes for haplotypes CGTCG and CAGCT and total deaths in men (hazard ratio = 3.5, 95% confidence interval: 1.8, 6.9, and hazard ratio = 2.8, 95% confidence interval: 1.3, 6.4, respectively).

However, in preclinical murine models, deletion of Pten alone fails to mimic the significant metastatic burden that frequently accompanies the end stage of human disease. To identify additional pathway alterations that cooperate with PTEN loss in prostate cancer progression, we surveyed human prostate cancer tissue microarrays and found that the RAS/MAPK pathway is significantly elevated in both primary and metastatic lesions. In an attempt to model this event, we crossed conditional activatable K-ras(G12D/WT) mice with the prostate conditional Pten deletion model. Although RAS activation alone cannot initiate prostate cancer development, it significantly accelerated progression caused by PTEN loss, accompanied by epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and macrometastasis with 100% penetrance. A novel stem/progenitor subpopulation with mesenchymal characteristics was isolated from the compound mutant prostates, which was highly metastatic upon orthotopic transplantation. Importantly, inhibition of RAS/MAPK signaling by PD325901, a mitogen-activated protein (MAP)-extracellular signal-regulated (ER) kinase (MEK) inhibitor, significantly reduced the metastatic progression initiated from transplanted stem/progenitor cells. Collectively, our findings indicate that activation of RAS/MAPK signaling serves as a potentiating second hit to alteration of the PTEN/PI3K/AKT axis, and cotargeting both the pathways is highly effective in preventing the development of metastatic prostate cancers.""","""['David J Mulholland', 'Naoko Kobayashi', 'Marcus Ruscetti', 'Allen Zhi', 'Linh M Tran', 'Jiaoti Huang', 'Martin Gleave', 'Hong Wu']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Cancer Res""","""['PTEN loss and activation of K-RAS and β-catenin cooperate to accelerate prostate tumourigenesis.', 'In vivo activity of combined PI3K/mTOR and MEK inhibition in a Kras(G12D);Pten deletion mouse model of ovarian cancer.', 'HDAC inhibition impedes epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity and suppresses metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR inhibitors: rationale and importance to inhibiting these pathways in human health.', 'Akt in prostate cancer: possible role in androgen-independence.', 'A synthetic lethal screen for Snail-induced enzalutamide resistance identifies JAK/STAT signaling as a therapeutic vulnerability in prostate cancer.', 'A potential biological signature of 7-methylguanosine-related lncRNA to predict the immunotherapy effects in bladder cancer.', 'Plexin-B1 Mutation Drives Metastasis in Prostate Cancer Mouse Models.', 'Phosphorylation of TGIF2 represents a therapeutic target that drives EMT and metastasis of lung adenocarcinoma.', 'Inhibitory Effects of Ursolic Acid on the Stemness and Progression of Human Breast Cancer Cells by Modulating Argonaute-2.']"""

Methods:   The study was a community-based, cross-sectional study targeting males 40 years and above in the township of Bedok North, Singapore. An interviewer-administered questionnaire inclusive of the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) was used to score symptom severity objectively.

To define prognostic biomarkers for aggressive prostate cancer, we carried out gene-expression profiling of 98 prostate tumors and 52 benign adjacent prostate tissue samples with detailed clinical annotation. We identified 28 transcripts significantly associated with recurrence after radical prostatectomy including NuSAP, a protein that binds DNA to the mitotic spindle. Elevated NuSAP transcript levels were associated with poor outcome in two independent prostate cancer gene-expression datasets. To characterize the role and regulation of NuSAP in prostate cancer, we studied the expression of NuSAP in the LNCaP and PC3 human prostate cancer cell lines. Posttranscriptional silencing of the NuSAP gene severely hampered the ability of PC3 to invade and proliferate in vitro. The promoter region of the NuSAP gene contains two CCAAT boxes and binding sites for E2F. Transient transfection of an E2F1 cDNA and 431 bp of the NuSAP promoter demonstrated E2F1 as an important regulator of expression. Deletion of the E2F-binding site at nucleotide -246 negated the effects of E2F1 on NuSAP expression. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated that nuclear extracts of cells overexpressing E2F1 bound directly to the E2F-binding site in the NuSAP promoter region. Finally, immunohistochemistry showed a strong correlation between E2F1 and NuSAP expression in human prostate cancer samples.

Doses were measured using gafchromic EBT films in the sagittal position. Each treatment plan was delivered to the static and dynamic phantom. Dose measurements performed with the dynamic phantom were quantitatively compared to static phantom doses in terms of dose-area histograms (DAH) for the planning target volume (PTV) and prostate, percentage of prostate and PTV receiving the prescription dose, and the minimum dose received by 95% of the prostate.

This multicenter protocol was characterized by the prospective evaluation of rectal toxicity, with a minimum follow-up of 36 months. Radiotherapy doses were between 70 and 80 Gy. Information was recorded for comorbidity, previous abdominal surgery, use of drugs and hormonal therapy. For each patient, a rectal dose-volume histogram (DVH) of the whole treatment was recorded and the equivalent uniform dose (EUD) evaluated as an effective descriptor of the whole DVH. Late rectal bleeding of grade ≥ 2 was considered to define positive events in this study (52 of 718 patients). The overall population was split into training and verification sets, both of which were involved in model instruction, and a test set, used to evaluate the predictive power of the model with independent data. Fourfold cross-validation was also used to provide realistic results for the full dataset. The LR was performed on the same data. Five variables were selected to predict late rectal bleeding: EUD, abdominal surgery, presence of hemorrhoids, use of anticoagulants and androgen deprivation. Following a receiver operating characteristic analysis of the independent test set, the areas under the curves (AUCs) were 0.704 and 0.655 for ANN and LR, respectively. When evaluated with cross-validation, the AUC was 0.714 for ANN and 0.636 for LR, which differed at a significance level of p = 0.03. When a practical discrimination threshold was selected, ANN could classify data with sensitivity and specificity both equal to 68.0%, whereas these values were 61.5% for LR. These data provide reasonable evidence that results obtained with ANNs are superior to those achieved with LR when predicting late radiotherapy-related rectal bleeding.

Here, we present a comprehensive landscape of the transcriptome profiles of 14 primary prostate cancers and their paired normal counterparts from the Chinese population using RNA-seq, revealing tremendous diversity across prostate cancer transcriptomes with respect to gene fusions, long noncoding RNAs (long ncRNA), alternative splicing and somatic mutations. Three of the 14 tumors (21.4%) harbored a TMPRSS2-ERG fusion, and the low prevalence of this fusion in Chinese patients was further confirmed in an additional tumor set (10/54=18.5%). Notably, two novel gene fusions, CTAGE5-KHDRBS3 (20/54=37%) and USP9Y-TTTY15 (19/54=35.2%), occurred frequently in our patient cohort.

We explore how CT image quality affects patient repositioning and CTV-to-PTV margins in soft tissue registration-based IGRT for prostate cancer patients.  Methods and materials:   Four CT-based IGRT modalities used for prostate RT were considered in this study: MV fan beam CT (MVFBCT) (Tomotherapy), MV cone beam CT (MVCBCT) (MVision; Siemens), kV fan beam CT (kVFBCT) (CTVision, Siemens), and kV cone beam CT (kVCBCT) (Synergy; Elekta). Daily shifts were determined by manual registration to achieve the best soft tissue agreement. Effect of image quality on patient repositioning was determined by statistical analysis of daily shifts for 136 patients (34 per modality). Inter- and intraobserver variability of soft tissue registration was evaluated based on the registration of a representative scan for each CT modality with its corresponding planning scan.  Results:   Superior image quality with the kVFBCT resulted in reduced uncertainty in soft tissue registration during IGRT compared with other image modalities for IGRT. The largest interobserver variations of soft tissue registration were 1.1 mm, 2.5 mm, 2.6 mm, and 3.2 mm for kVFBCT, kVCBCT, MVFBCT, and MVCBCT, respectively.  Conclusions:   Image quality adversely affects the reproducibility of soft tissue-based registration for IGRT and necessitates a careful consideration of residual uncertainties in determining different CTV-to-PTV margins for IGRT using different image modalities.""","""['Natalya V Morrow', 'Colleen A Lawton', 'X Sharon Qi', 'X Allen Li']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Observer uncertainties of soft tissue-based patient positioning in IGRT.', 'Assessment of interfraction patient setup for head-and-neck cancer intensity modulated radiation therapy using multiple computed tomography-based image guidance.', 'Patient positioning using in-room kV CT for image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT) of prostate cancer.', 'Image guided radiation therapy for prostate cancer; how, when and why?.', 'A review of cone-beam CT applications for adaptive radiotherapy of prostate cancer.', 'Insights From Image Guided Radiation Therapy Credentialing for the NRG Oncology RTOG 1112 Liver Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy Trial.', 'Dosimetric comparison of automatically propagated prostate contours with manually drawn contours in MRI-guided radiotherapy: A step towards a contouring free workflow?', 'Evaluating the impact of possible interobserver variability in CBCT-based soft-tissue matching using TCP/NTCP models for prostate cancer radiotherapy.', 'MR-guided radiotherapy for prostate cancer: state of the art and future perspectives.', 'Dose Reduction and Low-Contrast Detectability Using Iterative CBCT Reconstruction Algorithm for Radiotherapy.']"""

Although some of these markers have helped clinicians provide an earlier diagnosis (or prognosis), they have failed to provide adequate information about the mechanisms responsible for different stages of tumor malignancy so that more effective anticancer therapies can be developed. Recently translocator protein (TSPO), formerly known as the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR), has received attention as a potential target for anticancer drug development. It is a well-conserved protein, located at outer-inner mitochondrial membrane contact sites, and is expressed in almost all tissues, although the level of expression varies. TSPO is closely associated with the 32 kDa voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) and the 30 kDa adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT), considered to form the core of a mitochondria multiprotein complex [named the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP)] and plays a role in apoptotic cell death. As the major role of TSPO is steroid biosynthesis, TSPO expression is particularly high in organs involved in steroidogenesis such as the adrenals, testes, ovaries, placenta, prostate, colon, kidney, and cardiovascular system. It is well known that TSPO is over-expressed in highly aggressive tumors, especially those of the breast, and that expression correlates with advancing stages of this malignancy. TSPO expression, nuclear localization, and TSPO-mediated cholesterol transport into the nucleus are involved in breast cancer cell proliferation and aggressive phenotype expression. Hence, it can be used as a biomarker in the stage-dependent diagnosis of this cancer. In addition, cell proliferation, invasion and migration appears to be decreased when treated with high doses of TSPO ligand PK-11195, a compound that may represent a therapeutic agent for the control of breast cancer progression. Control of breast cancer development by consumption of dietary soy protein has been linked to down-regulation of the expression of TSPO-mediated angiogenic signaling molecules. This chapter provides insight into the potential of TSPO as a rational target for the development of novel therapeutics for breast cancer.""","""['S Mukherjee', 'S K Das']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Curr Mol Med""","""['Channel-like functions of the 18-kDa translocator protein (TSPO): regulation of apoptosis and steroidogenesis as part of the host-defense response.', 'Structural requirements to obtain highly potent and selective 18 kDa Translocator Protein (TSPO) Ligands.', ""18 kDa translocator protein--implications in cell's functions."", 'The role of 18 kDa mitochondrial translocator protein (TSPO) in programmed cell death, and effects of steroids on TSPO expression.', 'An update into the medicinal chemistry of translocator protein (TSPO) ligands.', '18F-Radiolabeled Translocator Protein (TSPO) PET Tracers: Recent Development of TSPO Radioligands and Their Application to PET Study.', 'Gold(I) Complexes with a Quinazoline Carboxamide Alkynyl Ligand: Synthesis, Cytotoxicity, and Mechanistic Studies.', 'Rewiring of Cancer Cell Metabolism by Mitochondrial VDAC1 Depletion Results in Time-Dependent Tumor Reprogramming: Glioblastoma as a Proof of Concept.', 'Causal Inference Network of Genes Related with Bone Metastasis of Breast Cancer and Osteoblasts Using Causal Bayesian Networks.', '18FFEPPA: Improved Automated Radiosynthesis, Binding Affinity, and Preliminary in Vitro Evaluation in Colorectal Cancer.']"""

Patients and methods:   18 patients entered into this prospective evaluation. Three gold markers were implanted into the prostate during the first HDR-brachytherapy procedure after the irradiation was administered. Three days after marker implantation all patients had a CT-scan for planning purpose of the percutaneous irradiation. Marker localization was defined on the digitally-reconstructed-radiographs (DRR) for daily (VMAT technique) or weekly (IMRT) set-up error correction. Percutaneous therapy started one week after first HDR-brachytherapy. After the second HDR-brachytherapy, two weeks after first HDR-brachtherapy, a cone-beam CT-scan was done to evaluate marker displacement due to needle insertion. In case of marker displacement, the actual positions of the gold markers were adjusted on the DRR.  Results:   The value of the gold marker displacement due to the second HDR-brachytherapy was analyzed in all patients and for each gold marker by comparison of the marker positions in the prostate after soft tissue registration of the prostate of the CT-scans prior the first and second HDR-brachytherapy. The maximum deviation was 5 mm, 7 mm and 12 mm for the anterior-posterior, lateral and superior-inferior direction. At least one marker in each patient showed a significant displacement and therefore new marker positions were adjusted on the DRRs for the ongoing percutaneous therapy.  Conclusions:   Needle insertion in the prostate due to HDR-brachytherapy can lead to gold marker displacements. Therefore, it is necessary to verify the actual position of markers after the second HDR-brachytherapy.

Somatic mutation of NRF2 has been analysed in a wide variety of human cancers, whereas somatic mutation of KEAP1 has been reported only in lung and gall bladder cancers. The aim of our study was to investigate whether KEAP1 mutations are widespread in human cancers.  Methods and results:   We analysed 499 cancer tissues from lung, breast, colon, stomach, liver, larynx and prostate, and leukaemias, by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis. We detected somatic mutations of KEAP1 in gastric (11.1%), hepatocellular (8.9%), colorectal (7.8%), lung (4.6%), breast (2.0%) and prostate (1.3%) carcinomas. Allelic losses of the KEAP1 locus were identified in 42.9% of cancers with KEAP1 mutations, but no NRF2 mutations were detected in these cancers. The NRF2-activated cytoprotective proteins (NAD(P)H dehydrogenase quinone 1 and glutamine-cysteine ligase catalytic subunit) were expressed in all of the cancers with KEAP1 mutations.  Conclusions:   Our data show that KEAP1 mutations occur widely in solid cancers, irrespective of histological type.

However, numerous studies have found little to no trace of XMRV in different human cohorts. Based on evidence suggesting common transmission routes between XMRV and HIV-1, HIV-1 infected individuals may represent a high-risk group for XMRV infection and spread.  Methodology/principal findings:   DNA was isolated from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of 179 HIV-1 infected treatment naïve patients, 86 of which were coinfected with HCV, and 54 healthy blood donors. DNA was screened for XMRV provirus with two sensitive, published PCR assays targeting XMRV gag and env and one sensitive, published nested PCR assay targeting env. Detection of XMRV was confirmed by DNA sequencing. One of the 179 HIV-1 infected patients tested positive for gag by non-nested PCR whereas the two other assays did not detect XMRV in any specimen. All healthy blood donors were negative for XMRV proviral sequences. Sera from 23 HIV-1 infected patients (15 HCV(+)) and 12 healthy donors were screened for the presence of XMRV-reactive antibodies by Western blot. Thirteen sera (57%) from HIV-1(+) patients and 6 sera (50%) from healthy donors showed reactivity to XMRV-infected cell lysate.  Conclusions/significance:   The virtual absence of XMRV in PBMCs suggests that XMRV is not associated with HIV-1 infected or HIV-1/HCV coinfected patients, or blood donors.

Moreover, treatment options for primary PCa for preventing the occurrence of CRPC is limited; therefore, novel strategy for direct inactivation of AR is urgently needed. In this study, we found loss of miR-34a, which targets AR, in PCa tissue specimens, especially in patients with higher Gleason grade tumors, consistent with increased expression of AR. Forced overexpression of miR-34a in PCa cell lines led to decreased expression of AR and prostate specific antigen (PSA) as well as the expression of Notch-1, another important target of miR-34a. Most importantly, BR-DIM intervention in PCa patients prior to radical prostatectomy showed re-expression of miR-34a, which was consistent with decreased expression of AR, PSA and Notch-1 in PCa tissue specimens. Moreover, BR-DIM intervention led to nuclear exclusion both in PCa cell lines and in tumor tissues.

Moreover, a dual labelling protocol has been optimised to facilitate a comparative study of the adhesion mechanisms and the effect of aberrant adhesion protein expression in both healthy and cancerous epithelial cells. This study reports clear differences in the morphology and phenotype of healthy and cancerous cells. In healthy prostate epithelial cells (PNT2), E-cadherin was predominantly located around the cell periphery and within filopodial extensions. The presence of E-cadherin appeared to be enhanced when cell-cell contact was established. In contrast, examination of metastatic prostate adenocarcinoma cells (PC-3) revealed no E-cadherin labelling around the periphery of the cells. This lack of functional E-cadherin in PC-3 cells coincided with a markedly different morphology and PC-3 cells were not found to form close cell-cell associations with their neighbours.

Sialyltransferases have received much attention in terms of their relationship with cancer because they modulate the expression of gangliosides. We previously demonstrated that GD1a production was high in castration-resistant prostate cancer cell lines, PC3 and DU145, mainly due to their high expression of β-galactoside α2,3-sialyltransferase (ST3Gal) II (not ST3Gal I), and the expression of both ST3Gals was regulated by NF-κB, mainly by RelB. We herein demonstrate that GD1a was produced in abundance in cancerous tissue samples from human patients with hormone-sensitive prostate cancers as well as castration-resistant prostate cancers. The expression of ST3Gal II was constitutively activated in castration-resistant prostate cancer cell lines, PC3 and DU145, because of the hypomethylation of CpG island in its promoter. However, in androgen-depleted LNCap cells, a hormone-sensitive prostate cancer cell line, the expression of ST3Gal II was silenced because of the hypermethylation of the promoter region. The expression of ST3Gal II in LNCap cells increased with testosterone treatment because of the demethylation of the CpG sites. This testosterone-dependent ST3Gal II expression was suppressed by RelB siRNA, indicating that RelB activated ST3Gal II transcription in the testosterone-induced demethylated promoter. Therefore, in hormone-sensitive prostate cancers, the production of GD1a may be regulated by androgen.

We therefore examined the potential effects of kava root extracts and its active components (kavalactones and flavokawains) on PCa growth and androgen receptor (AR) expression. PCa cell lines (LNCaP, LAPC-4, 22Rv1, C4-2B, DU145 and PC-3) with different AR expression, and a transformed prostate myofibroblast cell line (WPMY-1), were treated with a commercial kava extract, kavalactones (kawain, 5'6'-dehydrokawain, yangonin, methysticin) and flavokawain B. Expression of AR and its target genes (PSA and TMPRSS2) was examined. Two novel patient-derived PCa xenograft models from high grade PCa specimens were established by implanting the specimens into nude mice and passing tumor pieces through subcutaneous injection in nude mice, and then treated with kava extract and flavokawain B to examine their effects on tumor growth, AR expression and serum PSA levels. The kava extract and flavokawain B effectively down-regulated the expression of both the full-length AR and AR splice variants. The kava extract and kavalactones accelerated AR protein degradation, while flavokawain B inhibited AR mRNA transcription via decreasing Sp1 expression and the binding of Sp1 to the AR promoter. The kava root extract and flavokawain B reduce tumor growth, AR expression in tumor tissues and levels of serum PSA in the patient-derived PCa xenograft models.

With many small molecule inhibitors that target PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway being exploited clinically, sensitive and reliable ways of stratifying patients according to their PTEN functional status and determining treatment outcomes are urgently needed. Heterogeneous loss of PTEN is commonly associated with human cancers and yet PTEN can also be regulated on epigenetic, transcriptional or post-translational levels, which makes the use of simple protein or gene expression-based analyses in determining PTEN status less accurate. In this study, we used network component analysis to identify 20 transcription factors (TFs) whose activities deduced from their target gene expressions were immediately altered upon the re-expression of PTEN in a PTEN-inducible system. Interestingly, PTEN controls the activities (TFA) rather than the expression levels of majority of these TFs and these PTEN-controlled TFAs are substantially altered in prostate cancer mouse models. Importantly, the activities of these TFs can be used to predict PTEN status in human prostate, breast and brain tumor samples with enhanced reliability when compared to straightforward IHC-based or expression-based analysis. Furthermore, our analysis indicates that unique sets of PTEN-controlled TFAs significantly contribute to specific tumor types.

The transcriptional effects of estrogens are transduced by two estrogen receptors, ERα and ERβ, which elicit opposing roles in regulating proliferation: ERα is proliferative while ERβ is anti-proliferative. Exogenous expression of ERβ in ERα-positive cancer cell lines inhibits cell proliferation in response to estrogen and reduces xenografted tumor growth in vivo, suggesting that ERβ might oppose ERα's proliferative effects via formation of ERα/β heterodimers. Despite biochemical and cellular evidence of ERα/β heterodimer formation in cells co-expressing both receptors, the biological roles of the ERα/β heterodimer remain to be elucidated. Here we report the identification of two phytoestrogens that selectively activate ERα/β heterodimers at specific concentrations using a cell-based, two-step high throughput small molecule screen for ER transcriptional activity and ER dimer selectivity. Using ERα/β heterodimer-selective ligands at defined concentrations, we demonstrate that ERα/β heterodimers are growth inhibitory in breast and prostate cells which co-express the two ER isoforms. Furthermore, using Automated Quantitative Analysis (AQUA) to examine nuclear expression of ERα and ERβ in human breast tissue microarrays, we demonstrate that ERα and ERβ are co-expressed in the same cells in breast tumors. The co-expression of ERα and ERβ in the same cells supports the possibility of ERα/β heterodimer formation at physio- and pathological conditions, further suggesting that targeting ERα/β heterodimers might be a novel therapeutic approach to the treatment of cancers which co-express ERα and ERβ.""","""['Emily Powell', 'Erin Shanle', 'Ashley Brinkman', 'Jun Li', 'Sunduz Keles', 'Kari B Wisinski', 'Wei Huang', 'Wei Xu']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['A Computational-Based Approach to Identify Estrogen Receptor α/β Heterodimer Selective Ligands.', 'Generation of stable reporter breast cancer cell lines for the identification of ER subtype selective ligands.', 'Estrogen receptor-beta sensitizes breast cancer cells to the anti-estrogenic actions of endoxifen.', 'Estrogen receptor beta in breast cancer.', 'Estrogen receptor alpha negative breast cancer patients: estrogen receptor beta as a therapeutic target.', 'Significant Association of Estrogen Receptor-β Isoforms and Coactivators in Breast Cancer Subtypes.', 'ERβ1 Sensitizes and ERβ2 Desensitizes ERα-Positive Breast Cancer Cells to the Inhibitory Effects of Tamoxifen, Fulvestrant and Their Combination with All-Trans Retinoic Acid.', 'Cell Uptake of Steroid-BODIPY Conjugates and Their Internalization Mechanisms: Cancer Theranostic Dyes.', 'ERβ Isoforms Have Differential Clinical Significance in Breast Cancer Subtypes and Subgroups.', 'Estrogen Receptor β Expression and Its Clinical Implication in Breast Cancers: Favorable or Unfavorable?']"""

Although the genomic revolution appears to have had little impact on this problem, and might even have exacerbated it because of the flood of additional and usually ineffective leads, the emergence of high throughput resources promises the possibility of rapid, reliable and systematic identification of approved drugs for originally unintended uses. In this paper we develop and apply a method for identifying such repositioned drug candidates against breast cancer, myelogenous leukemia and prostate cancer by looking for inverse correlations between the most perturbed gene expression levels in human cancer tissue and the most perturbed expression levels induced by bioactive compounds. The method uses variable gene signatures to identify bioactive compounds that modulate a given disease. This is in contrast to previous methods that use small and fixed signatures. This strategy is based on the observation that diseases stem from failed/modified cellular functions, irrespective of the particular genes that contribute to the function, i.e., this strategy targets the functional signatures for a given cancer. This function-based strategy broadens the search space for the effective drugs with an impressive hit rate. Among the 79, 94 and 88 candidate drugs for breast cancer, myelogenous leukemia and prostate cancer, 32%, 13% and 17% respectively are either FDA-approved/in-clinical-trial drugs, or drugs with suggestive literature evidences, with an FDR of 0.01.

The effect of CCN3 on human prostate cancer cells, however, is unknown. Here, we have shown that CCN3 increased cell migration and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) expression in prostate cancer cells. In addition, expression of CCN3 was positively correlated with both cell migration and ICAM-1 expression in human prostate cancer cells. CCN3 activated a signal transduction pathway that included αvβ3 integrin, integrin-linked kinase (ILK), Akt and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB). Reagents that inhibit specific components of this pathway each diminished the ability of CCN3 to effect cell migration and ICAM-1 expression. Moreover, CCN3 increased binding of p65 to an NF-κB-binding element in the ICAM-1 promoter. Finally, knockdown of CCN3 expression markedly inhibited cell migration, tumor growth in bone and bone metastasis. Taken together, our results indicate that CCN3 enhances the migration of prostate cancer cells by increasing ICAM-1 expression through a signal transduction pathway that involves αvβ3 integrin, ILK, Akt and NF-κB.

Primary causes and molecular mechanisms of LNM are still largely unclear. We hypothesized that factors related with cancer progress and/or prognosis in OSCC are revealed by genome-wide investigation of DNA copy number aberrations (CNAs). In order to find biomarkers for occult LNM of OSCC, we comprehensively investigated genomic DNAs from 60 OSCC patients using Affymetrix mapping arrays and statistically analyzed correlations between CNAs of genes and the presence of occult LNM in the patients. The genome-wide CNA study indicated significant correlations between the presence of occult LNM and CNAs of certain genes. Through a literature survey, we narrowed down the candidates and focused on loss of NKX3-1, which is a homeodomain-containing transcription factor. NKX3-1 is known as a tumor suppressor gene in prostate cancer but has never been reported in OSCC. Quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry (IHC) analyses also showed significantly lower expression of NKX3-1 in the cases with occult LNM, which was further validated by IHC analysis in independent cases. The survival analyses indicated that NKX3-1 loss is a significant risk factor to decrease the disease-free survival (DFS) and the overall survival (OS) rates. This is the first time that the significant association of NKX3-1 loss and occult LNM was indicated in OSCC. The present results suggest that loss of NKX3-1 may be a potential biomarker for occult LNM of OSCC.""","""['Ken Miyaguchi', 'Narikazu Uzawa', 'Kaoru Mogushi', 'Ken-Ichiro Takahashi', 'Chieko Michikawa', 'Yoshimi Nakata', 'Jun Sumino', 'Norihiko Okada', 'Hiroshi Mizushima', 'Yutaka Fukuoka', 'Hiroshi Tanaka']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Int J Oncol""","""['Expression of vascular endothelial growth factor-C does not predict occult lymph-node metastasis in early oral squamous cell carcinoma.', 'Cyclin D1 gene numerical aberration is a predictive marker for occult cervical lymph node metastasis in TNM Stage I and II squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity.', 'High MMP-21 expression in metastatic lymph nodes predicts unfavorable overall survival for oral squamous cell carcinoma patients with lymphatic metastasis.', 'The diagnostic value of 11q13 amplification and protein expression in the detection of nodal metastasis from oral squamous cell carcinoma: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Prognostic factors of survival rate in oral squamous cell carcinoma: clinical, histologic, genetic and molecular concepts.', 'KLF5-induced miR-487a augments the progression of osteosarcoma cells by targeting NKX3-1 in vitro.', 'CNV Analysis of the Correlation between Preoperative Lymph Node Metastasis and Prognosis of Early Tongue Cancer.', 'The Role of Nkx3.1 in Cancers and Stemness.', 'A Novel RNA-Seq-Based Model for Preoperative Prediction of Lymph Node Metastasis in Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma.', 'The Homeodomain Transcription Factor NKX3.1 Modulates Bladder Outlet Obstruction Induced Fibrosis in Mice.']"""

Androgen receptor (AR), a key regulator of prostate cancer, has been shown to regulate its target genes via distal enhancers, leading to the hypothesis of global long-range gene regulation. However, despite numerous flows of newly generated data, the precise mechanism with respect to AR-mediated long-range gene regulation is still largely unknown. In this study, we carried out an integrated analysis combining several types of high-throughput data, including genome-wide distribution data of H3K4 di-methylation (H3K4me2), CCCTC binding factor (CTCF), AR and FoxA1 cistrome data as well as androgen-regulated gene expression data. We found that a subset of androgen-responsive genes was significantly enriched near AR/H3K4me2 overlapping regions and FoxA1 binding sites within the same CTCF block. Importantly, genes in this class were enriched in cancer-related pathways and were downregulated in clinical metastatic versus localized prostate cancer. Our results suggest a relatively short combinatorial long-range regulation mechanism facilitated by CTCF blocking. Under such a mechanism, H3K4me2, AR and FoxA1 within the same CTCF block combinatorially regulate a subset of distally located androgen-responsive genes involved in prostate carcinogenesis.""","""['Cenny Taslim', 'Zhong Chen', 'Kun Huang', 'Tim Hui-Ming Huang', 'Qianben Wang', 'Shili Lin']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Nucleic Acids Res""","""['Darolutamide antagonizes androgen signaling by blocking enhancer and super-enhancer activation.', 'Three-tiered role of the pioneer factor GATA2 in promoting androgen-dependent gene expression in prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptor regulates a distinct transcription program in androgen-independent prostate cancer.', 'Pioneer of prostate cancer: past, present and the future of FOXA1.', 'FOXA1: a transcription factor with parallel functions in development and cancer.', 'Prostate Cancer Epigenetic Plasticity and Enhancer Heterogeneity: Molecular Causes, Consequences and Clinical Implications.', 'Androgen receptor signaling and spatial chromatin organization in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Chromatin and Epigenetic Dysregulation of Prostate Cancer Development, Progression, and Therapeutic Response.', 'BRD9 Is a Critical Regulator of Androgen Receptor Signaling and Prostate Cancer Progression.', 'Darolutamide antagonizes androgen signaling by blocking enhancer and super-enhancer activation.']"""

As a diagnostic tool, the CTC count can be used to follow disease progression, and as a treatment tool, CTCs can be used to rapidly develop personalized therapeutic strategies. To be effectively used, however, CTCs must be isolated at high purity without inflicting cellular damage.  Methods:   We designed a microscale flow device with a functionalized surface of E-selectin and antibody molecules against epithelial markers. The device was additionally enhanced with a halloysite nanotube coating. We created model samples in which a known number of labeled cancer cells were suspended in healthy whole blood to determine device capture efficiency. We then isolated and cultured primary CTCs from buffy coat samples of patients diagnosed with metastatic cancer.  Results:   Approximately 50% of CTCs were captured from model samples. Samples from 12 metastatic cancer patients and 8 healthy participants were processed in nanotube-coated or smooth devices to isolate CTCs. We isolated 20-704 viable CTCs per 3.75-mL sample, achieving purities of 18%-80% CTCs. The nanotube-coated surface significantly improved capture purities (P = 0.0004). Experiments suggested that this increase in purity was due to suppression of leukocyte spreading.  Conclusions:   The device successfully isolates viable CTCs from both blood and buffy coat samples. The approximately 50% capture rate with purities >50% with the nanotube coating demonstrates the functionality of this device in a clinical setting and opens the door for personalized cancer therapies.""","""['Andrew D Hughes', 'Jeff Mattison', 'Laura T Western', 'John D Powderly', 'Bryan T Greene', 'Michael R King']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Clin Chem""","""['Catch me if you can: isolating circulating tumor cells from flowing blood.', 'Rapid isolation of viable circulating tumor cells from patient blood samples.', 'Immobilized surfactant-nanotube complexes support selectin-mediated capture of viable circulating tumor cells in the absence of capture antibodies.', 'Size-selective collection of circulating tumor cells using Vortex technology.', 'Technologies for detection of circulating tumor cells: facts and vision.', 'Current and future role of circulating tumor cells in patients with epithelial ovarian cancer.', 'Advances in the Biology, Detection Techniques, and Clinical Applications of Circulating Tumor Cells.', 'TRAIL-coated leukocytes to kill circulating tumor cells in the flowing blood from prostate cancer patients.', 'Antibody-Functionalized Halloysite Nanotubes for Targeting Bacterial Cells.', 'Application of Halloysite Nanotubes in Cancer Therapy-A Review.', 'Stabilization of the Hinge Region of Human E-selectin Enhances Binding Affinity to Ligands Under Force.']"""

We therefore investigated the role of inflammation-based prognostic scores, the modified Glasgow Prognostic Score (mGPS) and neutrophil lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and their associations with Gleason grade in patients with prostate cancer.  Methods:   Patients from a cohort, the Glasgow Inflammation Outcome Study, who had diagnosis of prostate cancer, were included in this study. The mGPS was constructed by combining C-reactive protein and albumin whereas NLR by calculating the ratio of neutrophils to lymphocytes. We estimated 5-year relative survival and relative excess risk (RER) of death by mGPS and NLR categories after adjusting for age, socioeconomic circumstances and Gleason grade.  Results:   In all, 897 prostate cancer patients were identified; of those 422 (47%) died during a maximum follow-up of 6.2 years. Systemic inflammation appeared to have significant prognostic value. The mGPS predicted poorer 5-year overall and relative survival independent of age, socioeconomic circumstances, disease grade and NLR. Raised mGPS also had a significant association with excess risk of death (mGPS 2: RER =2.41, 95% confidence interval 1.37-4.23) among aggressive, clinically significant prostate cancer (Gleason grades 8-10).  Conclusions:   The mGPS is a strong measure of systemic inflammation, when compared with NLR. Prostate cancer patients with a raised mGPS had significantly higher risk of death for overall as well high-grade disease.

Results:   Association of a biochemical network of 12 genes with SPARC gene as a central node was highlighted with PD phenotype. Of note, there was remarkable enrichment of NKXH_NKXH_HOX composite regulatory elements in the promoter of the genes in this network suggesting a biological significance of this gene-expression regulatory mechanism in CaP progression. Further, quantitative expression analyses of SPARC mRNA in primary prostate tumor cells of 110 patients validated the association of SPARC expression with poor differentiation and higher Gleason score. Most significantly, higher SPARC protein expression at the time of prostatectomy was associated with the subsequent development of metastasis (P=0.0006, AUC=0.803).

Methods:   Thirty-nine men with presumed localized PCa underwent dynamic-static abdominal-pelvic (11)C-acetate PET/CT for 30 min and 3-T multiparametric MRI before prostatectomy. PET/CT images were registered to MR images using pelvic bones for initial rotation-translation, followed by manual adjustments to account for prostate motion and deformation from the MRI endorectal coil. Whole-mount pathology specimens were sectioned using an MRI-based patient-specific mold resulting in improved registration between the MRI, PET, and pathology. (11)C-acetate PET standardized uptake values were compared with multiparametric MRI and pathology.  Results:   (11)C-acetate uptake was rapid but reversible, peaking at 3-5 min after injection and reaching a relative plateau at approximately 10 min. The average maximum standardized uptake value (10-12 min) of tumors was significantly higher than that of normal prostate tissue (4.4 ± 2.05 [range, 1.8-9.2] vs. 2.1 ± 0.94 [range, 0.7-3.4], respectively; P < 0.001); however, it was not significantly different from that of benign prostatic hyperplasia (4.8 ± 2.01 [range, 1.8-8.8]).

However, accurate segmentation of the prostate in computer tomography (CT) images remains challenging mainly due to three factors: (1) low image contrast between the prostate and its surrounding tissues, (2) unpredictable prostate motion across different treatment days and (3) large variations of intensities and shapes of the bladder and rectum around the prostate. In this paper, an online-learning and patient-specific classification method based on the location-adaptive image context is presented to deal with all these challenging issues and achieve the precise segmentation of the prostate in CT images. Specifically, two sets of location-adaptive classifiers are placed, respectively, along the two coordinate directions of the planning image space of a patient, and further trained with the planning image and also the previous-segmented treatment images of the same patient to jointly perform prostate segmentation for a new treatment image (of the same patient). In particular, each location-adaptive classifier, which itself consists of a set of sequential sub-classifiers, is recursively trained with both the static image appearance features and the iteratively updated image context features (extracted at different scales and orientations) for better identification of each prostate region. The proposed learning-based prostate segmentation method has been extensively evaluated on 161 images of 11 patients, each with more than nine daily treatment three-dimensional CT images. Our method achieves the mean Dice value 0.908 and the mean ± SD of average surface distance value 1.40 ± 0.57 mm. Its performance is also compared with three prostate segmentation methods, indicating the best segmentation accuracy by the proposed method among all methods under comparison.""","""['Wei Li', 'Shu Liao', 'Qianjin Feng', 'Wufan Chen', 'Dinggang Shen']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Learning image context for segmentation of prostate in CT-guided radiotherapy.', 'Prostate segmentation by sparse representation based classification.', 'Locally-constrained boundary regression for segmentation of prostate and rectum in the planning CT images.', 'MRI-GUIDED RADIOTHERAPY FOR PROSTATE CANCER: A NEW PARADIGM.', 'Investigation and benchmarking of U-Nets on prostate segmentation tasks.', 'Aligning Small Datasets Using Domain Adversarial Learning: Applications in Automated in Vivo Oral Cancer Diagnosis.', 'Three-dimensional prostate CT segmentation through fine-tuning of a pre-trained neural network using no reference labeling.', 'Deep Learning-Based Image Segmentation of Cone-Beam Computed Tomography Images for Oral Lesion Detection.', 'Boundary Restored Network for Subpleural Pulmonary Lesion Segmentation on Ultrasound Images at Local and Global Scales.', 'Hierarchical Vertex Regression-Based Segmentation of Head and Neck CT Images for Radiotherapy Planning.']"""

Objective:   Evaluate pathology findings after RP in our prospective AS cohort.  Design, setting, and participants:   All men participated in the Prostate Cancer Research International: Active Surveillance (PRIAS) study. Eligible men were initially diagnosed with low-risk PCa (clinical stage ≤ T2, prostate-specific antigen [PSA] ≤ 10 ng/ml, PSA density <0.2 ng/ml per ml, one or two positive biopsy cores, and Gleason score ≤ 6) and underwent RP between December 2006 and July 2011. The study protocol recommends RP in case of risk reclassification on repeat biopsy (Gleason score >6 and/or more than two positive cores) or a PSA doubling time ≤ 3 yr.  Measurements:   Descriptive statistics were used to report on pathology findings for staging and grading.  Results and limitations:   Pathology results were available in 167 out of 189 RP cases (88.4%). Median time to RP was 1.3 yr (range: 1.1-1.9). Protocol-based recommendations led to deferred RP in 143 men (75.7%); 24 men (12.7%) switched because of anxiety, and 22 (11.6%) had other reasons. Pathology results showed 134 (80.8%) organ-confined cases and 32 (19.2%) cases with extracapsular extension. Gleason scores ≤ 6, 3+4, 4+3, and 8 were found in 79 (47.3%), 64 (38.3%), 21 (12.6%), and 3 (1.8%) cases, respectively. Unfavourable RP results (pT3-4 and/or Gleason score ≥ 4+3) were found in 49 patients (29%), of whom 33 (67%) had a biopsy-related reason for deferred RP.  Conclusions:   RP results in men initially followed on AS show organ-confined disease and favourable Gleason grading in a majority of cases. Most men in our cohort had a protocol-based reason to switch to deferred RP. A main focus for AS protocols should be to improve the selection of patients at the time of inclusion to minimise reclassification of risk and preserve the chance for curative treatment, if indicated.""","""['Meelan Bul', 'Xiaoye Zhu', 'Antti Rannikko', 'Frédéric Staerman', 'Riccardo Valdagni', 'Tom Pickles', 'Chris H Bangma', 'Monique J Roobol']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['How best to use our tools?', 'Re: Meelan Bul, Xiaoye Zhu, Antti Rannikko, et al.

A narrow pH cut (ΔpH=0.5) of carrier ampholyte was used in IEF-AF4 to finely resolve phosphoproteins by pI. When the channel lane of multilane AF4 became acidic, the relative ratio of phosphorylated to unmodified or less phosphorylated peptides increased. The current method was applied to prostate cancer cell lysates to demonstrate that IEF-AF4 can examine the relative abundances of specific phosphoproteins, known as biomarkers, in prostate cancer.

Recently, the authors developed a nomogram to predict the risk of AUR preoperatively. The aim of this study was to assess the external validity of the nomogram.  Methods and materials:   The nomogram was initially developed on 714 patients treated with (125)I prostate brachytherapy at the University Medical Center Utrecht, the Netherlands. Predictive factors included in the nomogram were prostate volume, international prostate symptom score, neoadjuvant hormonal treatment, and prostate protrusion. For external validation, the data of 715 consecutive patients treated between January 2003 and July 2008 at the Princess Margaret Hospital, Toronto, were used. The performance of the nomogram was evaluated by discrimination (ability to distinguish between patients who develop AUR yes or no) and calibration (agreement between observed and predicted numbers of AUR).  Results:   Of the 715 patients treated at the Princess Margaret Hospital, 67 patients (9.4%) developed AUR compared with 8.0% in the University Medical Center Utrecht cohort. In the validation data set, the discriminatory ability of the nomogram was good (receive operating characteristic area: 0.86; 95% confidence interval: 0.82-0.91), and comparable to the derivation data set (receive operating characteristic area: 0.82; 95% confidence interval: 0.77-0.88). Comparison between the predicted risks and the observed frequencies of AUR showed underestimation of the nomogram in the validation data set for high AUR risks values. Still, the negative predictive value for the risk of AUR, using a cutoff value of 5%, was high (98.1%).  Conclusion:   External validation of the nomogram shows adequate discrimination of patients with and without AUR.

Methods and materials:   Data from 1009 patients treated on Radiation Therapy Oncology Group protocol 94-06 were analyzed using three approaches. First, the contribution of intermediate doses to a previously published fit of the Lyman-Kutcher-Burman (LKB) normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) model was determined. Next, the extent to which intermediate doses provide additional risk information, after taking the LKB model into account, was investigated. Third, the proportion of rectum receiving doses higher than a threshold, VDose, was computed for doses ranging from 5 to 85 Gy, and a multivariate Cox proportional hazards model was used to determine which of these parameters were significantly associated with time to Grade ≥ 2 late rectal toxicity.  Results:   Doses <60 Gy had no detectable impact on the fit of the LKB model, as expected on the basis of the small estimate of the volume parameter (n = 0.077). Furthermore, there was no detectable difference in late rectal toxicity among cohorts with similar risk estimates from the LKB model but with different volumes of rectum exposed to intermediate doses. The multivariate Cox proportional hazards model selected V75 as the only value of VDose significantly associated with late rectal toxicity.  Conclusions:   There is no evidence from these data that intermediate doses influence the risk of Grade ≥ 2 late rectal toxicity. Instead, the critical doses for this endpoint seem to be ≥ 75 Gy.

Results:   miR-21 expression in prostate cancer tissue samples was significantly associated with pathological stage, lymph node metastasis, capsular invasion, organ confined disease, Gleason score, biochemical recurrence and patient followup. Multivariate analysis also indicated that miR-21 expression could be an independent predictor of biochemical recurrence. The 5-year recurrence-free probability for patients positive vs negative for miR-21 expression was 33.9% vs 44.5%. In vivo treatment with antagomir-21 also repressed the tumor growth of DU145 cells in nude mice.  Conclusions:   Positive miR-21 expression was associated with poor biochemical recurrence-free survival and predicted the risk of biochemical recurrence in patients with prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy. Accordingly gene therapy using miR-21 inhibition strategies may prove useful for prostate cancer therapy.""","""['Tao Li', 'Run-Sheng Li', 'Yu-Hua Li', 'Shang Zhong', 'Yu-Ying Chen', 'Cun-Ming Zhang', 'Ming-Ming Hu', 'Zhou-Jun Shen']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['MicroRNA in prostate cancer: an opportunity to individualize patient care.', 'Improved risk stratification for biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy using a novel risk group system based on prostate specific antigen density and biopsy Gleason score.', 'Lymphovascular invasion is an independent prognostic factor in prostatic adenocarcinoma.', 'Overexpression of high mobility group box 1 with poor prognosis in patients after radical prostatectomy.', 'No difference in six-year biochemical failure rates with or without pelvic lymph node dissection during radical prostatectomy in low-risk patients with localized prostate cancer.', 'Decreased expression of lysophosphatidylcholine (16:0/OH) in high resolution imaging mass spectrometry independently predicts biochemical recurrence after surgical treatment for prostate cancer.', 'MiR-375 and miR-21 as Potential Biomarkers of Prostate Cancer: Comparison of Matching Samples of Plasma and Exosomes.', 'Secreted miR-153 Controls Proliferation and Invasion of Higher Gleason Score Prostate Cancer.', 'CRISPR-Cas knockout of miR21 reduces glioma growth.', 'The clinical significance of circulating miR-21, miR-142, miR-143, and miR-146a in patients with prostate cancer.', 'Prognostic value of miR-21 for prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.']"""

In the decision about treatment, the patients' subjective experience of function (bother) should also be considered. In this prospective study of CaP patients, we used both categorical and dimensional methods to examine changes of sexual, urinary, and bowel bother after robot-assisted prostatectomy (RALP), after high dose radiotherapy alone (RAD), or with adjuvant androgen deprivation therapy (RAD + ADT). We also studied the associations between psychosocial factors and post-treatment bother and the correlations between bother and function at the follow-up time points.  Methods:   A total of 462 patients (n = 150 RALP, n = 104 RAD, and n = 208 RAD + ADT) completed questionnaires at all time points (baseline, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months post-treatment). Our outcome measures were the proportion of patients who regained their baseline bother core (PBS-100) and the mean group scores on sexual, urinary, and bowel bother based on the UCLA-PCI questionnaire. Generalized estimating equation (GEE) identified the time points at which various variables were significantly associated with bother at 2 years. The time points at which the proportions of bothered patients became stable were defined.  Results:   The different treatment modalities provided distinctive patterns over time regarding urinary, sexual, and bowel bothers. RALP gave sexual and urinary bother, RAD + ADT patients reported bowel and sexual bother, while RAD patient suffered mainly from bowel bother. According to GEE, the bother scores at 3 or 6 months were significantly associated with the bother scores at 24 months for all groups. PBS-100 and stability of the recovered bother domains was reached at 3 to 6 months. Strong correlations were observed between function and bother for the urinary and bowel domains but not for the sexual domain. The associations between psychosocial factors and bother were weak.  Conclusions:   Two years after treatment, RALP patients mainly reported sexual and urinary bother, while irradiated patients were bothered by bowel dysfunction. Sexual, urinary, and bowel bother reached stable proportions at 3 to 6 months post-treatment.

Materials and methods:   Axial and sagittal DWI and T2-weighted imaging of the pelvis were evaluated in 157 patients with bladder cancer. Two observers assessed T2-weighted imaging with DWI independently. The observers pointed out 67 areas showing abnormal high signal intensity on DWI in the ureter (n = 17), urethra (n = 8), prostate (n = 20), and bone (n = 22). Of the 67 high-intensity areas, 33 lesions were confirmed histopathologically (ureter, n = 10; urethra, n = 7; prostate, n = 16), and 22 bone lesions were diagnosed using T1-weighted imaging and follow-up computed tomography. Thus, 55 lesions were evaluable for correlation with DWI findings.  Results:   Of the 55 high-intensity areas, 28 (53%) were synchronous or metastatic urothelial cancer or invasion of urothelial cancer.

Currently no consensus exists on which patients are at risk for impaired health related quality of life secondary to post-prostatectomy urinary incontinence. Using trajectory clustering analysis we identified predictors of post-prostatectomy urinary incontinence recovery in unique patient groups.  Materials and methods:   In a 5-year period health related quality of life was evaluated in patients treated with radical prostatectomy using UCLA-PCI preoperatively, and 3, 6 and 12 months postoperatively. We used a novel cluster modeling technique to identify unique group trajectories of urinary function recovery with time.  Results:   Group based modeling of UCLA-PCI urinary function scores identified 3 distinct post-prostatectomy urinary incontinence recovery patterns. The 73 group 1 patients had a significant postoperative decrease with only 33.4% of optimum function at 12 months. The 258 group 2 patients had moderately decreased urinary function at 3 months with improvement to 76.8% of optimum function at 12 months. The 89 group 3 patients had high scores throughout. Group 1 patients tended to be older (p=0.001), have major depression (p=0.008) and lower extremity circulatory disease (p=0.004), be a past or a current smoker (p=0.004) and have more comorbidities (p<0.001) than those in groups 2 and 3. On multivariate analysis age and the number of comorbidities significantly predicted inclusion in the poor function group.  Conclusions:   A novel modeling approach identified 3 distinct post-prostatectomy urinary incontinence recovery patterns. Patient age and the number of comorbidities predicted worse outcome.

Materials and methods:   Peripheral blood samples were collected from 57 patients with histologically confirmed prostate cancer, 8 patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia and 16 healthy donors. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated and antigen specific interferon-γ secretion of isolated T cells was analyzed by enzyme-linked immunospot assay. T cells were functionally characterized and T-cell responses before and after regulatory T-cell depletion were compared. As test tumor antigens, a panel of 11 long synthetic peptides derived from a total of 8 tumor antigens was used, including prostate specific antigen and prostatic acid phosphatase.  Results:   In patients with prostate cancer we noted a 74.5% effector T-cell response rate compared with only 25% in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia and 31% in healthy donors. In most patients 2 or 3 tumor antigens were recognized. Comparing various disease stages there was a clear increase in the immune response against prostate specific antigens from intermediate to high risk tumors and castration resistant disease. Regulatory T-cell depletion led to a significant boost in effector T-cell responses against prostate specific antigen and prostatic acid phosphatase.  Conclusions:   Tumor specific effector T cells were detected in most patients with prostate cancer, especially those with castration resistant prostate cancer.

In this study we determined the association between alcohol consumption and lower urinary tract symptoms, including voiding and storage symptoms, in a large general screening population.  Materials and methods:   This cross-sectional study included 30,196 men 30 years old or older participating in a comprehensive health evaluation at the Seoul National University Hospital Healthcare System Gangnam Center. Men with a history of prostate related medical problems such as prostate cancer, prostate surgery or prostatitis were excluded from study. Using the International Prostate Symptom Score, lower urinary tract symptoms were defined as a score of 8 or greater, indicating moderate to severe symptoms. We used logistic regression analysis to determine the association between alcohol consumption and lower urinary tract symptoms.  Results:   After adjustment for eligible covariates, graphing of the association between alcohol consumption and the risk of moderate to severe lower urinary tract symptoms showed a J-shaped curve. Compared with nondrinkers, the odds ratios of moderate to severe lower urinary tract symptoms were 0.91 (95% CI 0.84-0.98) in men who drank 0 to 10 gm daily and 1.19 (95% CI 1.07-1.33) in those who drank 40 or more gm daily. This is a cross-sectional study with data from self-reported alcohol consumption and, therefore, the reported amounts of alcohol consumption might be underestimated.  Conclusions:   To the best of our knowledge this is the largest population based study to evaluate the relationship between alcohol consumption and moderate to severe lower urinary tract symptoms, including voiding and storage symptoms.

We contrast screening-detected cancers with cancers not detected by screening among participants assigned to flexible sigmoidoscopy (FSG) in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial to determine the reasons for the lack of detection of prevalent lesions.  Design:   Cancers detected within 1 year of a screening FSG with abnormal findings were classified as screening detected. All other cancers were categorized, based on cancer stage and years until detection, as either not detectable or prevalent but not detected at the time of screening.  Setting/patients:   A total of 77,447 subjects in the multicenter PLCO trial.  Main outcome measurements:   A total of 977 colorectal cancers were diagnosed with a mean follow-up of 11.5 years.  Results:   A total of 243 (24.9%) cancers were screening detected, 470 (48.1%) were not detectable at screening, and 264 (27.0%) were considered prevalent but not detected. Among prevalent nondetected lesions, 35.6% (n = 94) were attributed to problems in patient compliance (58 never screened, 34 delayed colonoscopy follow-up, and 2 inadequate bowel preparation), 43.9% (n = 116) were attributable to a limitation in the FSG procedure (97 beyond the reach of the sigmoidoscope and 19 inadequate depth of insertion on FSG), and 20.5% (n = 54) were caused by endoscopist limitation (33 missed on FSG, 21 missed at initial colonoscopy) (P < .0001). Had colonoscopy instead of FSG been used for screening, an additional 15.6% and as many as 19.0% of cancers may have been screening-detected.  Limitations:   These estimates are reasonable approximations, but biological variability precludes precise determinations.  Conclusions:   Prevalent nondetected cancers were more often attributable to problems with patient compliance or limitations in the FSG procedure than to missed lesions.

In the present study, we determined the accuracy of DNA synthesis of the reverse transcriptases (RTs) of XMRV and Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMLV) using a combination of pre-steady-state kinetics of nucleotide incorporation and an M13mp2-based forward mutation assay. The results obtained were compared with those previously reported for the HIV type 1 BH10 strain (HIV-1(BH10)) RT. MoMLV and XMRV RTs were 13.9 and 110 times less efficient [as determined by the catalytic rate constant of the nucleotide incorporation reaction ((pol))/equilibrium constant (K(d))] than the HIV-1(BH10) RT in incorporating correct nucleotides. Misinsertion and mispair extension kinetic studies demonstrated that MoMLV RT was more accurate than the HIV-1(BH10) RT. In comparison with the MoMLV RT, the XMRV RT showed decreased mispair extension fidelity and was less faithful when misincorporating C or A opposite A. However, the XMRV RT showed stronger selectivity against G in misinsertion fidelity assays. Forward mutation assays revealed that XMRV and MoMLV RTs had similar accuracy of DNA-dependent DNA synthesis, but were > 13 times more faithful than the HIV-1(BH10) enzyme. The mutational spectra of XMRV and MoMLV RTs were similar in having a relatively higher proportion of frameshifts and transversions compared with the HIV-1(BH10) RT.

This study aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of Her-2/neu protein expression and clinicopathologic factors in antiandrogen-treated Chinese men with PCa for disease progression and PCa-specific death.  Methods:   Her-2/neu protein expression was determined using immunohistochemistry (IHC) in specimens collected from 124 prostate biopsies and transurethral resection of prostate (TURP) from seven prostate cancer patients.  Results:   Her-2/neu protein expression was 0, 1+, 2+, and 3+ in 40 (30.5%), 8 (6.1%), 67 (51.1%), and 16 (12.2%) cases, respectively.

PSA (P = 0.001), Gleason score (P = 0.017), cTNM (P = 0.000) and Her-2/neu protein expression (P = 0.001) had prognostic value for evaluating the progression of PCa in univariate analysis. In Kaplan-Meier plots, both Gleason score (P = 0.035) and cTNM (P = 0.013) correlated with PCa-specific death. In multivariate analysis, only cTNM was significant for both disease progression (P = 0.001) and PCa-specific death (P = 0.031).

In this study, we aimed to present the initial experience and evaluate the efficacy of laparoscopic radical prostatectomy performed through a single incision using a multichannel port.  Methods:   Between July 2010 and April 2011, six patients diagnosed with early stage prostate cancer underwent LESS radical prostatectomy (RP) in our institute. A multichannel port was inserted transperitoneally through a 2-cm umbilical incision. Specially articulating and flexible laparoscopic were used. Some technical tricks and points were applied during the operation to overcome the drawbacks and reduce the difficulties of this approach. Two continuous urethrovesical sutures in both sides were performed to complete both lateral aspects of anastomosis. The two ends of the suture threads were fixed by double Lapro-Clips, instead of the difficult knot-tying.  Results:   Total operative time was (265 ± 43) minutes. Mean blood loss was (230 ± 65) ml. All cases were completed successfully, without conversion to open surgery or adding additional abdomen ports. No patient required a blood transfusion and no intraoperative complications occurred. The Foley catheter was removed at the 14th day (range 12th - 16th) after surgery. At the 12th week of follow-up, all patients had an undetectable prostate-specific antigen level.

This study aimed to assess the influence of environmental exposure to Cd on long term outcome of inhabitants living in an area polluted by Cd.  Methods:   A 22-year follow-up study was conducted with 3119 inhabitants (1403 men and 1716 women) living in the Cd polluted Kakehashi River basin in Japan. The subjects were divided into 4 groups according to the amount of urinary Cd level (< 3.0 µg/g creatinine (Cr), 3.0 - 4.9 µg/g Cr, 5.0 - 9.9 µg/g Cr, and ≥ 10.0 µg/g Cr). Mortality was calculated by the person-years method. Hazards ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were assessed by the Cox's proportional hazard model.  Results:   Compared with urinary Cd < 3.0 µg/g Cr group, the HR of 5.0 - 9.9 µg/g Cr and ≥ 10.0 µg/g Cr groups were significantly increased after adjustment for age in both sexes: 1.24 (95%CI 1.01 - 1.51) and 1.48 (95%CI 1.17 - 1.90) for men; 1.64 (95%CI 1.17 - 2.28) and 1.78 (95%CI 1.27 - 2.50) for women.

We further applied MudPIT-based proteomics to generate and compare the differential proteome from a subset of pooled urines (pre-DRE) and EPS-urines (post-DRE) from noncancer and PCa patients. The direct proteomic comparison of these highly controlled patient sample pools enabled us to define a list of prostate-enriched proteins detectable in EPS-urine and distinguishable from a complex urine protein background. A combinatorial analysis of both proteomics data sets and systematic integration with publicly available proteomics data of related body fluids, human tissue transcriptomic data, and immunohistochemistry images from the Human Protein Atlas database allowed us to demarcate a robust panel of 49 prostate-derived proteins in EPS-urine.

We found that IR combined with ATO increases the therapeutic efficacy compared to individual treatments in LNCaP and PC-3 human prostate cancer cells. In addition, combined treatment showed enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation compared to treatment with ATO or IR alone in PC-3 cells. Combined treatment induced autophagy and apoptosis in LNCaP cells, and mainly induced autophagy in PC-3 cells. The cell death that was induced by the combined treatment was primarily the result of inhibition of the Akt/mTOR signaling pathways.

Recent evidence suggests that small interfering RNA (siRNA) induces transcriptional gene silencing (TGS) in human cells. In this study, transfection of siRNA against -9/+10 bp (siH3), but not -174/-155 bp (siH1) or -134/-115 bp (siH2) region relative to transcription start site (TSS) locating at 101 bp upstream of the translation start site, resulted in TGS of heparanase in human prostate cancer, bladder cancer, and gastric cancer cells in a sequence-specific manner. Methylation-specific PCR and bisulfite sequencing revealed no DNA methylation of CpG islands within heparanase promoter in siH3-transfected cells. The TGS of heparanase did not involve changes of epigenetic markers histone H3 lysine 9 dimethylation (H3K9me2), histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) or active chromatin marker acetylated histone H3 (AcH3). The regulation of alternative splicing was not involved in siH3-mediated TGS. Instead, siH3 interfered with transcription initiation via decreasing the binding of both RNA polymerase II and transcription factor II B (TFIIB), but not the binding of transcription factors Sp1 or early growth response 1, on the heparanase promoter. Moreover, Argonaute 1 and Argonaute 2 facilitated the decreased binding of RNA polymerase II and TFIIB on heparanase promoter, and were necessary in siH3-induced TGS of heparanase. Stable transfection of the short hairpin RNA construct targeting heparanase TSS (-9/+10 bp) into cancer cells, resulted in decreased proliferation, invasion, metastasis and angiogenesis of cancer cells in vitro and in athymic mice models. These results suggest that small RNAs targeting TSS can induce TGS of heparanase via interference with transcription initiation, and significantly suppress the tumor growth, invasion, metastasis and angiogenesis of cancer cells.""","""['Guosong Jiang', 'Liduan Zheng', 'Jiarui Pu', 'Hong Mei', 'Jun Zhao', 'Kai Huang', 'Fuqing Zeng', 'Qiangsong Tong']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Heparanase gene silencing, tumor invasiveness, angiogenesis, and metastasis.', 'Small RNA interference-mediated gene silencing of heparanase abolishes the invasion, metastasis and angiogenesis of gastric cancer cells.', 'miRNA-558 promotes tumorigenesis and aggressiveness of neuroblastoma cells through activating the transcription of heparanase.', 'Regulation, function and clinical significance of heparanase in cancer metastasis and angiogenesis.', 'Heparanase: Historical Aspects and Future Perspectives.', 'Long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) HOTAIR: Pathogenic roles and therapeutic opportunities in gastric cancer.', 'Therapeutic targeting of the USP2-E2F4 axis inhibits autophagic machinery essential for zinc homeostasis in cancer progression.', 'Modulating the Crosstalk between the Tumor and Its Microenvironment Using RNA Interference: A Treatment Strategy for Hepatocellular Carcinoma.', 'Long Noncoding RNA NHEG1 Drives β-Catenin Transactivation and Neuroblastoma Progression through Interacting with DDX5.', 'Heparanase: A Challenging Cancer Drug Target.']"""

We provide evidence that the retinoic acid receptor gamma (RAR-G) plays a major role in the regulation of the hTGP gene and that presence of the AR, but not its transcriptional transactivation activity, is critical for hTGP transcription. RA and androgen responsive elements (RARE and ARE) were mapped to the hTGP promoter by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), which also indicated that the active ARE and RARE sites were adjacent, suggesting that the antagonistic effect of androgen and RA is related to the relative position of binding sites. Publicly available AR and RAR ChIP-seq data was used to find gene potentially regulated by AR and RAR. Four of these genes (CDCA7L, CDK6, BTG1 and SAMD3) were tested for RAR and AR binding and two of them (CDCA7L and CDK6) proved to be antagonistically regulated by androgens and RA confirming that this regulation is not particular of hTGP.""","""['Guillermo C Rivera-Gonzalez', 'Alastair P Droop', 'Helen J Rippon', 'Katrin Tiemann', 'Davide Pellacani', 'Lindsay J Georgopoulos', 'Norman J Maitland']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Nucleic Acids Res""","""['Androgen and retinoic acid interaction in LNCaP cells, effects on cell proliferation and expression of retinoic acid receptors and epidermal growth factor receptor.', 'Changes in tissue transglutaminase activity and expression during retinoic acid-induced growth arrest and apoptosis in primary cultures of human epithelial prostate cells.', 'Sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c represses the transactivation of androgen receptor and androgen-dependent growth of prostatic cells.', 'Androgen receptor enhancer usage and the chromatin regulatory landscape in human prostate cancers.', 'Transglutaminase-4 (Prostate Transglutaminase), a Potential Biological Factor and Clinical Indicator for the Diagnosis and Prognosis of Prostate Cancer.', 'Expansion of the 4-(Diethylamino)benzaldehyde Scaffold to Explore the Impact on Aldehyde Dehydrogenase Activity and Antiproliferative Activity in Prostate Cancer.', 'Biochemical Characterisation of Human Transglutaminase 4.', 'TGM4: an immunogenic prostate-restricted antigen.', 'Recent Progress in Discovering the Role of Carotenoids and Their Metabolites in Prostatic Physiology and Pathology with a Focus on Prostate Cancer-A Review-Part I: Molecular Mechanisms of Carotenoid Action.', 'Resistance to Antiandrogens in Prostate Cancer: Is It Inevitable, Intrinsic or Induced?']"""

These AR variants termed ARΔLBD are either products of alternative splicing, point mutations leading to premature stop codons or proteolytic cleavage of the AR. Some controversies exist about the requirement of additional full-length AR for the full transcriptional activity of the ARΔLBD. On basis of a mutated, C-terminally truncated AR termed Q640X, we developed an experimental model for the study of ARΔLBD in PCa cells.  Methods:   Activation of AR-dependent promoters was analyzed by reporter gene assays. Dimerization studies were conducted using a mammalian two-hybrid system.  Results:   Although Q640X/Q640X homodimers were able to induce the expression of certain AR target genes, Q640X/AR heterodimers were necessary to activate the full panel of androgen-dependent genes under androgen-deprived conditions.  Conclusions:   The following study supports the hypothesis that castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) cells are able to activate specific androgen-dependent genes by selective modulation of the ratio between ARΔLBD and their putative dimerization partners like the full-length AR or other ARΔLBD in the absence of androgens.

Despite modern surgical techniques, 15%-30% of prostate cancer patients undergoing radical prostatectomy develop a biochemical recurrence during follow-up. Unfortunately, poor analytical sensitivity of standard PSA assays delays biochemical recurrence detection, and because of day-to-day assay imprecision ultrasensitive PSA assays cannot assess PSA kinetics. We developed an immuno-PCR assay for total PSA that has a limit of quantification >10 times lower than current ultrasensitive assays.  Methods:   The 2-site immunometric assay for total PSA employed 2 monoclonal antibodies, one conjugated to a double-stranded DNA label and the other bound to paramagnetic microparticles. After several washing steps, quantification cycles were determined and values were converted to PSA concentrations. We characterized analytical performance and compared accuracy with a commercially available total PSA assay.  Results:   The limit of quantification was 0.65 ng/L and the assay was linear in the range of 0.25-152.0 ng/L. Total imprecision estimates at PSA concentrations of 3.8, 24.1, and 69.1 ng/L were <15.2%, <9.4%, and <10.6%, respectively. Recovery of supplemented PSA ranged from 87.5% to 119.2% (mean 100.3%). Dilution recovery ranged from 96.4% to 115.3% (mean 102.3%). There was no high-dose hook effect up to 50 000 ng/L of PSA. Comparison with the commercial PSA assay showed a regression slope of 1.06 and a correlation coefficient of 0.996.

In the present study we report that the C-terminal truncated AR, which we named AR-NH1 (the N-terminal fragment of AR cleaved in the neighborhood of helix 1 of the ligand-binding domain), is produced in LNCaP prostatic carcinoma cells. The AR-NH1 of ~90 kDa was observed in an androgen-independent LNCaP subline and was further accumulated by the proteasome inhibitor MG132. MG132 treatment caused the accumulation of AR-NH1 even in parent LNCaP cells. AR-NH1 was produced in the absence of ligand or in the presence of the AR antagonist bicalutamide, whereas AR agonists suppressed its production. AR-NH1 was detected with different AR antibodies recognizing amino acid residues 1-20 and 300-316 and was also generated from exogenous AR. Both siRNA-mediated AR knockdown and treatment with a serine protease inhibitor (4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride) reduced AR-NH1 levels. According to the predicted cleavage site (between amino acid residues 660-685) and its nuclear localization, it is assumed that AR-NH1 functions as a constitutively active transcription factor. These data suggest that AR-NH1 is produced under hormone therapy and contributes to the development of castration-resistant prostate cancer due to its ligand-independent transcriptional activity.""","""['Naoki Harada', 'Kaoru Inoue', 'Ryoichi Yamaji', 'Yoshihisa Nakano', 'Hiroshi Inui']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Cancer Sci""","""['Activity of androgen receptor antagonist bicalutamide in prostate cancer cells is independent of NCoR and SMRT corepressors.', 'A competitive inhibitor that reduces recruitment of androgen receptor to androgen-responsive genes.', 'Hunterian Lecture.

For high-throughput genomic datasets, the common approach to analyzing ordinal response data has been to break the problem into one or more dichotomous response analyses. This dichotomous response approach does not make use of all available data and therefore leads to loss of power and increases the number of type I errors. Herein we describe an innovative frequentist approach that combines two statistical techniques, L(1) penalization and continuation ratio models, for modeling an ordinal response using gene expression microarray data. We conducted a simulation study to assess the performance of two computational approaches and two model selection criteria for fitting frequentist L(1) penalized continuation ratio models. Moreover, we empirically compared the approaches using three application datasets, each of which seeks to classify an ordinal class using microarray gene expression data as the predictor variables. We conclude that the L(1) penalized constrained continuation ratio model is a useful approach for modeling an ordinal response for datasets where the number of covariates (p) exceeds the sample size (n) and the decision of whether to use Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) or Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) for selecting the final model should depend upon the similarities between the pathologies underlying the disease states to be classified.""","""['K J Archer', 'A A A Williams']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Stat Med""","""['Bayesian penalized cumulative logit model for high-dimensional data with an ordinal response.', 'Development of a clinical prediction model for an ordinal outcome: the World Health Organization Multicentre Study of Clinical Signs and Etiological agents of Pneumonia, Sepsis and Meningitis in Young Infants.

In this chapter, we updated current information on methylated genes associated with the development and progression of prostate cancer. Over 40 genes have been investigated for methylation in promoter region in prostate cancer. These methylated genes are involved in critical pathways, such as DNA repair, metabolism, and invasion/metastasis. The role of hypermethylated genes in regulation of critical pathways in prostate cancer is discussed.

Given the comparable efficacy of both modalities quality of life (QOL) has been suggested as an additional decision criterion. In recent years several validated instruments have been introduced to assess QOL. Most of them allow for patient-based rating of QOL.  Aim:   Herein, we aim to compare QOL after RP and RT in our own cohort of patients in Tübingen using validated questionnaires.  Methods:   In total, 165 patients who had been treated for PC in Tübingen were enrolled. Of those 100 men had RP and 65 had RT. The validated QOL questionnaires EORTC QLQ-C30 and EORTC QLQ-PR 25 were used for assessment. Statistical analyses focused on analyses of variance.  Results:   Concordant to previous studies it could be shown that RP mainly creates voiding problems most importantly urinary incontinence but also erectile dysfunction. After RT, patients mainly complained about disturbed bowel function including diarrhea and proctitis as well as about urgency and frequency. RP patients had better PF2 Scale values than RT patients (p= 0.00357143). On DI scales RT patients yielded significantly poorer values than the RP group (p= 0.003333).

Recently, a novel peptide obtained using a phage display library demonstrated an affinity for prostate tumor cells. The aim of this study was to compare the use of a bombesin analog to that of a phage display library peptide (DUP-1) radiolabeled with technetium-99m for the treatment of prostate carcinoma. The peptides were first conjugated to S-acetyl-MAG3 with a 6-carbon spacer, namely aminohexanoic acid.  Methods:   The technetium-99m labeling required a sodium tartrate buffer. Radiochemical evaluation was performed using ITLC and was confirmed by high-performance liquid chromatography. The coefficient partition was determined, and in vitro studies were performed using human prostate tumor cells. Biodistribution was evaluated in healthy animals at various time points and also in mice bearing tumors.  Results:   The radiochemical purity of both radiotracers was greater than 95%. The DUP-1 tracer was more hydrophilic (log P = -2.41) than the bombesin tracer (log P = -0.39). The biodistribution evaluation confirmed this hydrophilicity by revealing the greater kidney uptake of DUP-1. The bombesin concentration in the pancreas was greater than that of DUP-1 due to specific gastrin-releasing peptide receptors. Bombesin internalization occurred for 78.32% of the total binding in tumor cells. The DUP-1 tracer showed very low binding to tumor cells during the in vitro evaluation, although tumor uptake for both tracers was similar. The tumors were primarily blocked by DUP1 and the bombesin radiotracer primarily targeted the pancreas.  Conclusion:   Further studies with the radiolabeled DUP-1 peptide are recommended. With further structural changes, this molecule could become an efficient alternative tracer for prostate tumor diagnosis.""","""['Bluma Linkowski Faintuch', 'Erica A Oliveira', 'Eutimio G F Nunez', 'Ana M Moro', 'P K Nanda', 'Charles J Smith']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Clinics (Sao Paulo)""","""['Radiolabeled bombesin analogs for prostate cancer diagnosis: preclinical studies.', 'Synthesis and evaluation of a technetium-99m labeled cytotoxic bombesin peptide conjugate for targeting bombesin receptor-expressing tumors.', '18F-labeled bombesin analogs for targeting GRP receptor-expressing prostate cancer.', 'Gastrin releasing peptide (GRP) receptor targeted radiopharmaceuticals: a concise update.', 'An update of radiolabeled bombesin analogs for gastrin-releasing peptide receptor targeting.', 'Cell-Penetrating Peptides Derived from Animal Venoms and Toxins.']"""

It is derived from the proteolytic cleavage of collagen XVIII, which is encoded by the COL18A1 gene. A polymorphic COL18A1 allele encoding the functional polymorphism p.D104N impairs the activity of endostatin, resulting in a decreased ability to inhibit angiogenesis. This polymorphism has been previously analyzed in many types of cancer and has been considered a phenotype modulator in some benign and malignant tumors. However, these data are controversial, and different results have been reported for the same tumor types, such as prostate and breast cancer. The purpose of this study was to genotype the p.D104N variant in a cohort of pediatric and adult patients with adrenocortical tumors and to determine its possible association with the biological behavior of adrenocortical tumors.  Methods:   DNA samples were obtained from 38 pediatric and 56 adult patients (0.6-75 yrs) with adrenocortical tumors. The DNA samples were obtained from peripheral blood, frozen tissue or paraffin-embedded tumor blocks when blood samples or fresh frozen tissue samples were unavailable. Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis was used to genotype the patients and 150 controls. The potential associations of the p.D104N polymorphism with clinical and histopathological features and oncologic outcome (age of onset, tumor size, malignant tumor behavior, and clinical syndrome) were analyzed.  Results:   Both the patient group and the control group were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The frequencies of the p.D104N polymorphism in the patient group were 81.9% (DD), 15.9% (DN) and 2.2% (NN).

Methods and materials:   Of 125 patients, 47 patients with and without local recurrence confirmed by biopsy or clinical follow-up were identified. All patients underwent DCE-MRI with a spatial resolution of 3 mm and mean temporal resolution of 11.3 seconds (range, 8.4-14.0 seconds).  Results:   In patients with local recurrence, the mean (± SD) prostate-specific antigen level and tumor size were 1.9 ± 1.8 mg/dL and 10.8 ± 5.7 mm, respectively, at the time of MRI. Thirty-six of 37 patients (97%) with biopsy or clinically confirmed local recurrence had positive MRI findings. Eight of 10 patients (80%) with negative recurrence had negative MRI findings. Of the 36 patients, 16 (44%) had time-intensity curves of rapid increase-rapid washout and 18 (50%) had rapid increase-plateau or slow washout. The recurrent tumor reached the peak enhancement within one phase following the peak enhancement of the common femoral artery. In patients with a negative MRI result, the mean PSA level was 0.2 ± 0.1 mg/dL.  Conclusion:   DCE-MRI using high temporal and spatial resolution is highly accurate in detecting subcentimeter local recurrences within the postprostatectomy bed.

Materials and methods:   Twenty-four patients with rising prostate-specific antigen levels after having completed radiation therapy 30-130 months earlier (median, 62 months) underwent endorectal T2-weighted imaging and DWI (b = 0, 100, 300, 500, and 800 s/mm(2)) followed by transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided biopsy. Images were scored prospectively as positive for tumor if a region of low signal intensity on T2-weighted imaging within the prostate corresponded with a focally restricted area on the ADC map. A region of interest (ROI) was drawn around the suspicious lesion on a single slice of the ADC map and a corresponding ROI was drawn around presumed nontumor irradiated peripheral zone and central gland tissues on the opposite side of the prostate. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were determined against TRUS-guided biopsy reference standard (octant, n = 17; sextant, n = 5; two samples, n = 1; 12 samples, n = 1).

Therefore, we sought to investigate this question with tremendous public health implications. Data on mortality rates of cancers of the breast, colon, prostate, esophagus, and stomach for China (1988-2000), Hong Kong (1960-2006), Japan (1950-2006), Korea (1985-2006), and Singapore (1963-2006) were obtained from WHO. Joinpoint regression was used to investigate trends in mortality of these cancers. A remarkable increase in mortality rates of breast, colon, and prostate cancers and a precipitous decrease in those of esophageal and stomach cancers have been observed in selected countries (except breast cancer in Hong Kong) during the study periods. For example, the annual percentage increase in breast cancer mortality was 5.5% (95% confidence interval: 3.8, 7.3%) for the period 1985-1993 in Korea, and mortality rates for prostate cancer significantly increased by 3.2% (95% confidence interval: 3.0, 3.3%) per year from 1958 to 1993 in Japan. These changes in cancer mortality lagged ∼ 10 years behind the inception of the nutrition transition toward a westernized diet in selected countries or regions.

Methods:   Patients scheduled for a transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) biopsy of the prostate because of elevated prostate-specific antigen levels or abnormal digital rectal examination result underwent a standard TRUS and SWE. A second TRUS examination and sextant biopsy by a second physician blinded to SWE results was then performed. Pathologic result was reviewed, and sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value (NPV), and positive predictive value (PPV) were calculated.  Results:   A total of 53 patients (318 sextants) participated in the study. Mean age was 64.2 years (range, 53-79 years). A total of 26 foci of PC were detected in 11 patients (20.7%). On the basis of the receiver operating characteristic curve, a value of 37 kPa was used as the cutoff between benign and malignant. This produced a sensitivity of 96.2% (25/26), a specificity of 96.2% (281/292), a PPV of 69.4% (25/36), and an NPV of 99.6% (281/282). Six (55%) of 11 false-positive samples were secondary to benign calcifications. The Young modulus of PC ranged from 30 to 110 kPa (mean [SD], 58.0 [20.7] kPa).

We conducted a survey with breast, prostate, and colon cancer patients diagnosed in 2005 (n = 2,013), who were randomly drawn from the Pennsylvania Cancer Registry in the fall of 2006. We found that education was more strongly associated with Internet use than with the use of other sources regardless of topics. Also, when information was sought from mass media, education had a greater association with treatment information seeking than with quality-of-life information seeking. Preference for active participation in treatment decision making, however, did not moderate the effect of education on treatment information seeking.

HIF-1α activity is associated with nuclear accumulation of the transcription factor and regulated by several mechanisms including modulation of protein stability and degradation. Among recent advances are the discoveries that inflammation-induced cytokines and growth factors affect protein accumulation of HIF-1α under normoxia conditions. TNFα, a major pro-inflammatory cytokine that promotes tumorigenesis is known as a stimulator of HIF-1α activity. To improve our understanding of TNFα-mediated regulation of HIF-1α nuclear accumulation we screened a kinase-specific siRNA library using a cell imaging-based HIF-1α-eGFP chimera reporter assay. Interestingly, this systematic analysis determined that depletion of kinases involved in conventional TNFα signaling (IKK/NFκB and JNK pathways) has no detrimental effect on HIF-1α accumulation. On the other hand, depletion of PRKAR2B, ADCK2, TRPM7, and TRIB2 significantly decreases the effect of TNFα on HIF-1α stability in osteosarcoma and prostate cancer cell lines. These newly discovered regulators conveyed their activity through a non-conventional RELB-depended NFκB signaling pathway and regulation of superoxide activity. Taken together our data allow us to conclude that TNFα uses a distinct and complex signaling mechanism to induce accumulation of HIF-1α in cancer cells. In summary, our results illuminate a novel mechanism through which cancer initiation and progression may be promoted by inflammatory cytokines, highlighting new potential avenues for fighting this disease.""","""['Angela Schoolmeesters', 'Daniel D Brown', 'Yuriy Fedorov']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""[""Hypoxia and hypoglycaemia in Ewing's sarcoma and osteosarcoma: regulation and phenotypic effects of Hypoxia-Inducible Factor."", 'DEC2 expression is positively correlated with HIF-1 activation and the invasiveness of human osteosarcomas.', 'Inflammatory stimulation and hypoxia cooperatively activate HIF-1{alpha} in bronchial epithelial cells: involvement of PI3K and NF-{kappa}B.', 'Regulation of the Hypoxia-Inducible Factor (HIF) by Pro-Inflammatory Cytokines.', 'Hypoxia, stem cells and bone tumor.', 'Identification of the mitochondrial protein ADCK2 as a therapeutic oncotarget of NSCLC.', 'Integrative Analysis of Bulk RNA-Seq and Single-Cell RNA-Seq Unveils the Characteristics of the Immune Microenvironment and Prognosis Signature in Prostate Cancer.', 'ADCK2 Knockdown Affects the Migration of Melanoma Cells via MYL6.', 'Suppression of TRPM7 Inhibited Hypoxia-Induced Migration and Invasion of Androgen-Independent Prostate Cancer Cells by Enhancing RACK1-Mediated Degradation of HIF-1α.', 'ADCK2 Haploinsufficiency Reduces Mitochondrial Lipid Oxidation and Causes Myopathy Associated with CoQ Deficiency.']"""

However, the therapeutic strategy to target these AR splice variants still remains unresolved. Through tissue survey of tumors from the same patients before and after castration resistance, we found that the expression of AR3, a major AR splice variant that lacks the AR ligand-binding domain, was substantially increased after castration resistance development. The currently used antiandrogen, Casodex, showed little growth suppression in CWR22Rv1 cells. Importantly, we found that AR degradation enhancer ASC-J9 could degrade both full-length (fAR) and AR3 in CWR22Rv1 cells as well as in C4-2 and C81 cells with addition of AR3. The consequences of such degradation of both fAR and AR3 might then result in the inhibition of AR transcriptional activity and cell growth in vitro. More importantly, suppression of AR3 specifically by short-hairpin AR3 or degradation of AR3 by ASC-J9 resulted in suppression of AR transcriptional activity and cell growth in CWR22Rv1-fARKD (fAR knockdown) cells in which DHT failed to induce, suggesting the importance of targeting AR3. Finally, we demonstrated the in vivo therapeutic effects of ASC-J9 by showing the inhibition of PCa growth using the xenografted model of CWR22Rv1 cells orthotopically implanted into castrated nude mice with undetectable serum testosterone. These results suggested that targeting both fAR- and AR3-mediated PCa growth by ASC-J9 may represent the novel therapeutic approach to suppress castration-resistant PCa.

This study investigated the ability of a synthetic small-molecular-weight nontoxic carbohydrate-based TF-Ag mimic lactulose-L-leucine (Lac-L-Leu) to inhibit these processes in vitro and, ultimately, prostate cancer bone metastasis in vivo. Using an in vivo mouse model, based on intracardiac injection of human PC-3 prostate carcinoma cells stably expressing luciferase, we investigated the ability of Lac-L-Leu to impede the establishment and growth of bone metastasis. Parallel-flow chamber assay, homotypic aggregation assay, modified Boyden chamber assay, and clonogenic growth assay were used to assess the effects of Lac-L-Leu on tumor cell adhesion to the endothelium, homotypic tumor cell aggregation, transendothelial migration, and clonogenic survival and growth, respectively. We report that daily intraperitoneal administration of Lac-L-Leu resulted in a three-fold (P < .05) decrease in metastatic tumor burden compared with the untreated control. Mechanistically, the effect of Lac-L-Leu, which binds and inhibits galectins by mimicking essential structural features of the TF-Ag, was associated with a dose-dependent inhibition of prostate cancer cell adhesion to bone marrow endothelium, homotypic aggregation, transendothelial migration, and clonogenic growth.

Severe comorbidity was associated with higher overall mortality in the lung, colorectal, and prostate cancer patients, hazard ratios 1.51 (95% CI 1.24-1.83), 1.41 (95% CI 1.14-1.73), and 2.14 (95% CI 1.65-2.77), respectively. Comorbidity did not affect cancer-specific mortality in general.  Conclusion:   Colorectal and lung cancer was associated with increased comorbidity burden in the elderly compared with the background population.

In this study, we aimed to retrospectively evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of DTX with or without EMP and to elucidate the significance of DTX and EMP combination therapy in Japanese EMP-refractory CRPC patients.  Methods:   To compare the efficacy and toxicity of DTX and EMP, we divided CRPC patients, who were confirmed to be resistant to EMP, into the following two groups: group D (n = 28), which included patients treated with DTX (60 mg/m2, once in every four weeks) alone, and group DE (n = 33), which included patients treated with a combination of DTX (60 mg/m2, once in every four weeks) and EMP (twice daily oral administration at 280 mg).  Results:   Prostate specific antigen (PSA) response (> 50% decline in PSA) was observed in six patients (21%) in group D and eight patients (24%) in group DE. The median time to progression (TTP) was 12.0 months and 6.2 months and the median overall survival (OS) was 26.4 months and 24.3 months in group D and DE, respectively. There was no statistical difference between the two groups in terms of PSA response, TTP, and OS. The incidence of adverse events of grade 3/4 was low in both the groups, and there was no statistical difference between the two groups.

The sensitivity of a magnetic field strength of 7 T might enable 3D (31)P MR spectroscopic imaging with relevant spatial resolution in a clinically acceptable measurement time. To this end, a (31)P endorectal coil was developed and combined with an eight-channel (1)H body-array coil to relate metabolic information to anatomical location. An extensive safety validation was performed to evaluate the specific absorption rate, the radiofrequency field distribution, and the temperature distribution of both coils. This validation consisted of detailed Finite Integration Technique simulations, confirmed by MR thermometry and B 1+ measurements in a phantom and in vivo temperature measurements. The safety studies demonstrated that the presence of the (31)P endorectal coil had no influence on the specific absorption rate levels and temperature distribution of the external eight-channel (1)H array coil. To stay within a 10 g averaged local specific absorption rate of 10 W/kg, a maximum time-averaged input power of 33 W for the (1)H array coil was allowed. For transmitting with the (31)P endorectal coil, our safety limit of less than 1°C temperature increase in vivo during a 15-min MR spectroscopic imaging experiment was reached at a time-averaged input power of 1.9 W. With this power setting, a second in vivo measurement was performed on a healthy volunteer. Using adiabatic excitation, 3D (31)P MR spectroscopic imaging produced spectra from the entire prostate in 18 min with a spatial resolution of 4 cm(3).

Detected lesions were compared against expert markings to assess the accuracy of the CAD system. The metrics Bone Scan Lesion Area, Bone Scan Lesion Intensity, and Bone Scan Lesion Count were calculated from identified lesions, and their utility in assessing treatment effects was evaluated by analyzing before and after scans from metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients: 10 treated and 10 untreated.

Gene-gene interaction is speculated to be one of the major factors contributing to the so-called missing heritability. To evaluate the gene-gene interaction and PCa risk, we performed a two-stage genome-wide gene-gene interaction scan using a novel statistical approach named ""Boolean Operation-based Screening and Testing"".

Methods:   Acute side effects and DVH data were evaluated of the first 40 intermediate risk prostate cancer patients treated with a definitive daily image-guided SIB-IMRT protocol via helical tomotherapy in our department. The planning target volume including the prostate and the base of the seminal vesicles with safety margins was treated with 70 Gy in 35 fractions. The boost volume containing the prostate and 3 mm safety margins (5 mm craniocaudal) was treated as SIB to a total dose of 76 Gy (2.17 Gy per fraction). Planning constraints for the anterior rectal wall were set in order not to exceed the dose of 76 Gy prescribed to the boost volume. Acute toxicity was evaluated prospectively using a modified CTCAE (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events) score.  Results:   SIB-IMRT allowed good rectal sparing, although the full boost dose was permitted to the anterior rectal wall. Median rectum dose was 38 Gy in all patients and the median volumes receiving at least 65 Gy (V65), 70 Gy (V70), and 75 Gy (V75) were 13.5%, 9%, and 3%, respectively.

The 2005 International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP)-modified Gleason grading scheme defines several gland arrangements of high Gleason grade patterns 4 and 5. The aim of this investigation was to quantitate the frequency of the ISUP-defined high Gleason grade patterns in needle biopsy tissue, to determine the common admixtures and to characterize patterns not presented in the 2005 ISUP report. For patients who underwent radical prostatectomy, we analyzed for association of specific high-grade patterns in needle biopsy with extraprostatic extension in radical prostatectomy tissues. A total of 268 prostate needle biopsy cases with Gleason score of 8 to 10 were examined. A mean of 3.6 patterns (range, 1 to 8) were identified per case and only 12% of cases had a pure single pattern. Ill-defined glands with poorly formed lumina (at 57%) and fused microacinar glands (at 53%) comprised the predominant and most frequently admixed patterns. Single cells and single signet ring cells were present in 53% and 31% of cases, respectively. Additional patterns in order of frequency included cords (35%), cribriform glands (25%), sheets of cells (19%), chains (4%), glomeruloid (3%), comedonecrosis (2%), and hypernephromatoid (1 case=0.3%). Gleason score 8 to 10 carcinomas are typically extensive in needle core tissue, with a mean of 4.4 positive cores (range, 1 to 15 cores) per case. Only 14 cases (5%) had high-grade minimal carcinoma measuring <1 mm in needle core tissue. Gleason grade patterns not described in the 2005 ISUP report include single file growth, solid cylinders, and nested patterns. The single file pattern was present in 40% of cases, and the small solid nested pattern was detected in 24% of cases. One case displayed solid cylinders. Only the single file pattern was associated with extraprostatic extension at radical prostatectomy (P=0.005). These results show that the 2005 ISUP-defined patterns of high Gleason score 8 to 10 prostatic adenocarcinoma can be stratified on the basis of frequency of occurrence in needle biopsy tissue. Three patterns not defined in the 2005 ISUP scheme have been characterized, including single file, nested, and solid cylinder arrangements. As aggressive and potentially lethal prostate cancer is most often of Gleason score 8 to 10, it is important for diagnostic recognition purposes to be aware of the frequency of various patterns encountered in high Gleason score 8 to 10 adenocarcinomas, the types of pattern admixtures, and the histomorphologic presentation of unusual patterns. We propose that Gleason grade assignments should incorporate single file, solid nested, and solid cylinder arrangements as high-grade pattern 5 because of the absence of glandular luminal space formation.""","""['Srinivas Gottipati', 'Jason Warncke', 'Robin Vollmer', 'Peter A Humphrey']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Am J Surg Pathol""","""['High-grade foamy gland prostatic adenocarcinoma on biopsy or transurethral resection: a morphologic study of 55 cases.', 'High-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasialike ductal adenocarcinoma of the prostate: a clinicopathologic study of 28 cases.', 'SOCS3 Immunohistochemical Expression Seems to Support the 2005 and 2014 International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) Modified Gleason Grading System.', 'The 2014 International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) Consensus Conference on Gleason Grading of Prostatic Carcinoma: Definition of Grading Patterns and Proposal for a New Grading System.', 'Contemporary Gleason Grading of Prostatic Carcinoma: An Update With Discussion on Practical Issues to Implement the 2014 International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) Consensus Conference on Gleason Grading of Prostatic Carcinoma.', 'Patient with prostatic adenocarcinoma with plasmacytoid features and an aberrant immunohistochemical phenotype diagnosed by biopsy and a mini-review of plasmacytoid features in the genitourinary system: A case report.', 'Development of a highly sensitive digital PCR assay to quantify long non-coding RNA MYU in urine samples which exhibited great potential as an alternative diagnostic biomarker for prostate cancer.', 'Comedonecrosis Gleason pattern 5 is associated with worse clinical outcome in operated prostate cancer patients.', 'Stunning Response with Low-Dose Enzalutamide after Abiraterone Acetate Failure in a Patient Diagnosed with Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: A Case Report.', 'Comedonecrosis Revisited: Strong Association With Intraductal Carcinoma of the Prostate.']"""

We used RNAi to deplete 12 different Rho GTPases to screen for effects on uPA-stimulated migration, and found that depletion of RhoB significantly reduces uPA-induced migration and invasion of prostate carcinoma cells. RhoB depletion did not affect the expression or surface levels of uPAR but reduced the uPAR-induced increase in levels of several integrins and inhibited uPAR signalling to the actin regulator cofilin, the cell-adhesion signal-transduction adaptor molecule paxillin and the serine/threonine kinase Akt. uPAR rapidly activated RhoB and increased RhoB expression. RhoB depletion also reduced cell adhesion to and spreading on vitronectin, which is a uPAR ligand.

Limited data are available regarding robotic extended pelvic lymphadenectomy (PLA) in this setting.  Objective:   Analyze our experience performing robotic extended PLA.  Design, setting, and participants:   A total of 143 consecutive men with intermediate- or high-risk clinically localized adenocarcinoma of the prostate underwent robotic extended PLA and radical prostatectomy between September 2010 and November 2011 by a single surgeon.  Surgical procedure:   Lymph node packets were sent separately from bilateral common, external, and internal iliacs, obturators, node of Cloquet, and anterior prostatic fat.  Measurements:   Descriptive statistics were used to summarize lymph node yields and positive nodes. Clinical variables were examined in logistic regression models to predict lymph node positivity.  Results and limitations:   Median lymph node yield was 20 (range: 9-65, interquartile range: 15-25). Eighteen patients (13%) were found to have metastatic prostate cancer in the lymph nodes. The mean number of positive nodes found was 2.9 (range: 1-11). In 14 of 18 node-positive patients (78%), the extent of nodal invasion was outside the boundaries of a limited PLA. For four patients with positive nodes (22%), prostate biopsy predicted unilateral disease but PLA revealed contralateral positive lymph nodes. A total of 82% of patients experienced no complications, and most Clavien grade 1-2 complications consisted of anastomotic leakage, urinary retention, ileus, and lymphocele. Only 4% of patients experienced a grade 3 complication. Under multivariate regression analysis, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), clinical stage, and maximum biopsy core tumor volume were identified as significant predictors of finding positive pelvic lymph nodes (area under the curve: 91%). The main limitations include short follow-up and lack of randomization.  Conclusions:   Robotic extended bilateral PLA for prostate cancer up to the common iliac bifurcation increases nodal yield and positive nodal rate and can be performed safely. PSA, clinical stage, and maximum biopsy core volume are predictors for lymph node invasion.

However, this two-step approach has limited sensitivity and specificity.  Objective:   Evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of whole-body MRI (WBMRI) as a one-step screening test for PCa metastases.  Design, setting, and participants:   One hundred consecutive PCa patients at high risk for metastases prospectively underwent WBMRI, CT, and BS completed with targeted x-rays (BS/TXR) in case of equivocal BS. Four independent reviewers reviewed the images.  Measurements:   This study compares the diagnostic performance of WBMRI, CT, BS, and BS/TXR in detecting PCa metastases using area under the curve (AUC) receiver operator characteristics. A best valuable comparator (BVC) approach was used to adjudicate final metastatic status in the absence of pathologic evaluation.  Results and limitations:   Based on the BVC, 68 patients had metastases. The sensitivity of BS/TXR and WBMRI for detecting bone metastases was 86% and 98-100%, respectively (p<0.04), and specificity was 98% and 98-100%, respectively. The first and second WBMRI readers respectively identified bone metastases in 7 and 8 of 55 patients with negative BS/TXR. The sensitivity of CT and WBMRI for detecting enlarged lymph nodes was similar, at 77-82% for both; specificity was 95-96% and 96-98%, respectively. The sensitivity of the combination of BS/TXR plus CT and WBMRI for detecting bone metastases and/or enlarged lymph nodes was 84% and 91-94%, respectively (p=0.03-0.10); specificities were 94-97% and 91-96%, respectively. The 95% confidence interval of the difference between the AUC of the worst WBMRI reading and the AUC of any of the BS/TXR plus CT lay within the noninferiority margin of ±10% AUC.  Conclusions:   WBMRI outperforms BS/TXR in detecting bone metastases and performs as well as CT for enlarged lymph node evaluation. WBMRI can replace the current multimodality metastatic work-up for the concurrent evaluation of bones and lymph nodes in high-risk PCa patients.""","""['Frédéric E Lecouvet', 'Jawad El Mouedden', 'Laurence Collette', 'Emmanuel Coche', 'Etienne Danse', 'François Jamar', 'Jean-Pascal Machiels', 'Bruno Vande Berg', 'Patrick Omoumi', 'Bertrand Tombal']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Whole-body magnetic resonance imaging and prostate cancer metastases: a new gold standard of detection, but does it help us and at what cost?', 'Prostate cancer - detection of metastases: MRI or scintigraphy better?.', 'One-step TNM staging of high-risk prostate cancer using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): toward an upfront simplified ""all-in-one"" imaging approach?', 'Prospective evaluation of planar bone scintigraphy, SPECT, SPECT/CT, 18F-NaF PET/CT and whole body 1.5T MRI, including DWI, for the detection of bone metastases in high risk breast and prostate cancer patients: SKELETA clinical trial.', 'Magnetic resonance imaging of the axial skeleton for detecting bone metastases in patients with high-risk prostate cancer: diagnostic and cost-effectiveness and comparison with current detection strategies.', 'Head-To-Head Comparison of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT and 99mTc-MDP Bone Scintigraphy for the Detection of Bone Metastases in Patients With Prostate Cancer: A Meta-Analysis.', 'Detection of vertebral metastases: a meta-analysis comparing MRI, CT, PET, BS and BS with SPECT.', 'The current status of prostate cancer treatment and PSMA theranostics.', 'Personalizing approaches to the management of metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer: role of advanced imaging, genetics and therapeutics.', 'AGREEMENT ON MRI DIAGNOSIS IN COMPRESSIVE MALIGNANT VERTEBRAL FRACTURES.', 'Diagnostic and cost-effectiveness of axial skeleton MRI in staging high-risk prostate cancer.', 'Next-Generation Diffusion Imaging of Osseous Metastases.']"""

Patients and methods:   Six patients were treated for prostate cancer with conformal irradiation. Daily online cone beam computed tomography was performed for repositioning and an additional one was performed following irradiation once weekly. Four craniocaudal levels were defined to calculate movements amplitudes compared to the scanner tracking: level 1 at the bladder neck, level 2 at mid-height of the bladder, level 3 at mid-height of the dome, level 4 at the apex in a distended bladder. Bladder height was also measured.  Results:   On 198 daily cone beam computed tomographies, radial bladder right/left/anterior/posterior wall displacements at level 2 were 0.08 ± 0.24, 0.11 ± 0.33, 0.16 ± 0.45 and 0.14 ± 0.50 cm and at level 3 0.07 ± 0.78, 0.18 ± 0.98, 0.43 ± 0.94 and 0.04 ± 1.02 cm. Dome and neck displacements were 0.08 ± 1.41 cm and 0.08 ± 0.64 cm. Seventeen cone beam computed tomographies were done following irradiation. Radial bladder right/left/anterior/halfway up the trine wall displacements at level 2 before and after irradiation were 0.02±0.18, 0.01±0.30, 0.09 ± 0.32 and 0.22 ± 0.42 cm and at level 3 0.27 ± 0.60, 0.37 ± 1.15, 0.18 ± 0.87 and 0.54 ± 1.68 cm.  Conclusion:   Significant bladder wall displacements were observed on the anterior wall and upper portion of the bladder. Isotropic margins may not be sufficient to account for inter- and intrafraction bladder wall displacements at the latter levels. Tailored bladder anatomy-based anisotropic margins may be necessary to optimally spare the small intestine and to guaranty proper tumour coverage in case of bladder cancer. For upper bladder tumours, margins of over 2 cm would be necessary, which make them less adequate for external beam irradiation.""","""['Q Pan', 'J Thariat', 'F Bogalhas', 'J-L Lagrange']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Cancer Radiother""","""['Image-guided radiation therapy for muscle-invasive bladder cancer.', 'Intrafraction bladder motion in radiation therapy estimated from pretreatment and posttreatment volumetric imaging.', 'Quantification of organ motion during chemoradiotherapy of rectal cancer using cone-beam computed tomography.', 'Impact of intrafraction and residual interfraction effect on prostate proton pencil beam scanning.', 'Pelvic nodal dosing with registration to the prostate: implications for high-risk prostate cancer patients receiving stereotactic body radiation therapy.', 'Image-guided radiation therapy for muscle-invasive bladder cancer.']"""

The signaling of BMP family members is tightly regulated by their antagonists, including noggin and SOST, which are, in turn, positively regulated by BMP, thereby forming a negative feedback loop. Consequently, the expression of these antagonists should be taken into account in studies on the prognostic significance of BMP. In the present paper, we correlated protein and mRNA expression levels of BMP6, noggin and SOST, alone or in combination, with patient survival in various types of cancer. We found that BMP6 alone was not significantly correlated with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma patient survival. Instead, a high level of inhibitor of differentiation 1, a downstream factor of BMP6, was associated with shorter survival in patients whose tumors stained strongly for BMP6. Knockdown of noggin in esophageal cancer cell line EC109, which expresses BMP6 strongly and SOST weakly, enhanced the non-adherent growth of the cells. Noggin and SOST expression levels, when analyzed alone, were not significantly correlated with patient survival. However, high BMP6 activity, defined by strong BMP6 expression coupled with weak noggin or SOST expression, was significantly associated with shorter survival in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma patients. We further confirmed that BMP6 activity could be used as a prognostic indicator in prostate, bladder and colorectal cancers, using publicly available data on BMP6, noggin and SOST mRNA expression and patient survival.

Results:   Median follow-up was 108 months [interquartile range (IQR) 73.5-144.5]. The median serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was 16.9 ng/ml (IQR 7-37.2). Median biopsy and pathological Gleason (pGS) score were both scored as 7 (range 4-10 and 5-9, respectively). Overstaging was frequent (37.2%); four patients (7.8%) had organ-confined stage pT2, while 15 (29.4%) had extracapsular extension only (pT3a). Another 23 (45.1%) were confirmed with seminal vesicle invasion (pT3b) and nine (17.7%) had adjacent structure invasion (pT4). Eleven patients (21.6%) had lymph-node involvement. Thirty-two patients (62.7%) had positive surgical margins. The BPFS, CPFS, CSS and OS at 5 and 10 years were 52.7%, 45.8%;78.0%, 72.5%; 91.9%, 91.9% and 88.0%, 70.7%. In the multivariate Cox proportional hazard models, pathological stage was an independent predictor of BPFS while preoperative PSA and pGS was an independent predictor of CPFS.  Conclusions:   The management of cT3b-T4 PCa typically consists of a multimodality treatment in which RP is a valuable first step. Overstaging was frequent (37.2%), and almost one-quarter of the patients remained free of additional treatments. Long-term cancer-related outcomes were very satisfactory.""","""['Steven Joniau', 'Chao-Yu Hsu', 'Paolo Gontero', 'Martin Spahn', 'Hein Van Poppel']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Scand J Urol Nephrol""","""['Radical prostatectomy improves progression-free and cancer-specific survival in men with lymph node positive prostate cancer in the prostate-specific antigen era: a confirmatory study.', 'Radical prostatectomy represents an effective treatment in patients with specimen-confined high pathological Gleason score prostate cancer.', 'Impact of positive surgical margins on prostate-specific antigen failure after radical prostatectomy in adjuvant treatment-naïve patients.', 'No difference in six-year biochemical failure rates with or without pelvic lymph node dissection during radical prostatectomy in low-risk patients with localized prostate cancer.', 'Long-term oncological outcomes after laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.', 'Surgical management of high-risk, localized prostate cancer.', 'The role of cystoprostatectomy in management of locally advanced prostate cancer: a systematic review.', 'Comparative effectiveness of radical prostatectomy with adjuvant radiotherapy versus radiotherapy plus androgen deprivation therapy for men with advanced prostate cancer.', 'Surgical margin status and its impact on prostate cancer prognosis after radical prostatectomy: a meta-analysis.', 'Radical prostatectomy in locally advanced prostate cancer.']"""

Such modifications are likely to lead to only slight improvements in outcomes. Although small differences would be worthwhile, an appropriately powered randomized trial would need to be very large, and thus of doubtful feasibility given the expense, complexity and regulatory burden of contemporary clinical trials. We have proposed a novel methodology, the clinically-integrated randomized trial, which dramatically streamlines trial procedures in order to reduce the marginal cost of an additional patient towards zero. We aimed to determine the feasibility of implementing such a trial for radical prostatectomy.  Methods:   Patients undergoing radical prostatectomy as initial treatment for prostate cancer were randomized in a factorial design to involvement of the fascia during placement of the anastomotic sutures, urethral irrigation, both or neither. Endpoint data were obtained from routine clinical documentation. Accrual and compliance rates were monitored to determine the feasibility of the trial.  Results:   From a total of 260 eligible patients, 154 (59%) consented; 56 patients declined to participate, 20 were not approached on recommendation of the treating surgeon, and 30 were not approached for logistical reasons. Although recording by surgeons of the procedure used was incomplete (~80%), compliance with randomization was excellent when it was recorded, with only 6% of procedures inconsistent with allocation. Outcomes data was received from 71% of patients at one year. This improved to 83% as the trial progressed.  Conclusions:   A clinically-integrated randomized trial was conducted at low cost, with excellent accrual, and acceptable compliance with treatment allocation and outcomes reporting. This demonstrates the feasibility of the methodology. Improved methods to ensure documentation of surgical procedures would be required before wider implementation.
