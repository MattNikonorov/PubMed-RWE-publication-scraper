The present study was undertaken to establish the possibility of using a combination of specific oncogenic products, including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), pAkt, nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) and macrophage inhibitory cytokine-1 (MIC-1) as biomarkers and therapeutic targets for optimizing the management of patients with localized PC at earlier disease stages. The immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence data have revealed that the expression levels of EGFR, Ser(473)-pAkt, NF-κB p65 and MIC-1 proteins were significantly enhanced in the same subset of 76 cases of prostatic adenocarcinoma specimens during the disease progression and these biomarkers were expressed in a small subpopulation of CD133(+) PC cells and the bulk tumor mass of CD133(-) PC cells. Importantly, all of these biomarkers were also overexpressed in 80-100% of 30 PC metastasis bone tissue specimens. Moreover, the results have indicated that the EGF-EGFR signaling pathway can provide critical functions for the self-renewal of side population (SP) cells endowed with stem cell-like features from highly invasive WPE1-NB26 cells. Of therapeutic interest, the targeting of EGFR, pAkt, NF-κB or MIC-1 was also effective at suppressing the basal and EGF-promoted prostasphere formation by SP WPE1-NB26 cells, inducing disintegration of SP cell-derived prostaspheres and decreasing the viability of SP and non-SP WPE1-NB26 cell fractions. Also, the targeting of these oncogenic products induced the caspase-dependent apoptosis in chemoresistant SP WPE1-NB26 cells and enhanced their sensibility to the cytotoxic effects induced by docetaxel. These findings suggest that the combined use of EGFR, pAkt, NF-κB and/or MIC-1 may represent promising strategies for improving the accuracy of current diagnostic and prognostic methods and efficacy of treatments of PC patients in considering the disease heterogeneity, thereby preventing PC progression to metastatic and lethal disease states.""","""['Murielle Mimeault', 'Sonny L Johansson', 'Surinder K Batra']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Cytotoxic effects induced by docetaxel, gefitinib, and cyclopamine on side population and nonside population cell fractions from human invasive prostate cancer cells.', 'Marked improvement of cytotoxic effects induced by docetaxel on highly metastatic and androgen-independent prostate cancer cells by downregulating macrophage inhibitory cytokine-1.', 'Frequent gene products and molecular pathways altered in prostate cancer- and metastasis-initiating cells and their progenies and novel promising multitargeted therapies.', 'Hierarchical clustering of immunohistochemical analysis of the activated ErbB/PI3K/Akt/NF-kappaB signalling pathway and prognostic significance in prostate cancer.', 'Animal models relevant to human prostate carcinogenesis underlining the critical implication of prostatic stem/progenitor cells.', 'C-reactive protein levels could be a prognosis predictor of prostate cancer: A meta-analysis.', 'GDF15 promotes prostate cancer bone metastasis and colonization through osteoblastic CCL2 and RANKL activation.', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Is Increased in Conjunctival Malignant Melanoma.', 'AKT in Bone Metastasis of Solid Tumors: A Comprehensive Review.', 'Growth and differentiation factor 15 and NF-κB expression in benign prostatic biopsies and risk of subsequent prostate cancer detection.']"""

The effectivity of these therapies is limited and the development of alternative approaches is necessary. In the present study, we report on the use of the multikinase inhibitor sorafenib in a panel of prostate cancer cell lines and their derivatives which mimic endocrine and chemotherapy resistance. (3)H-thymidine incorporation assays revealed that sorafenib causes a dose-dependent inhibition of proliferation of all cell lines associated with downregulation of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 and cyclin D1 expression. Apoptosis was induced at 2 μM of sorafenib in androgen-sensitive cells, whereas a higher dose of the drug was needed in castration-resistant cell lines. Sorafenib stimulated apoptosis in prostate cancer cell lines through downregulation of myeloid cell leukemia-1 (MCL-1) expression and Akt phosphorylation. Although concentrations of sorafenib required for the antitumor effect in therapy-resistant sublines were higher than those needed in parental cells, the drug showed efficacy in cells which became resistant to bicalutamide and docetaxel respectively. Most interestingly, we show that sorafenib has an inhibitory effect on androgen receptor (AR) and prostate-specific antigen expression. In cells in which AR expression was downregulated by short interfering RNA, the treatment with sorafenib increased apoptosis in an additive manner. In summary, the results of the present study indicate that there is a potential to use sorafenib in prostate cancers as an adjuvant therapy option to current androgen ablation treatments, but also in progressed prostate cancers that become unresponsive to standard therapies.""","""['Su Jung Oh', 'Holger H H Erb', 'Alfred Hobisch', 'Frédéric R Santer', 'Zoran Culig']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Endocr Relat Cancer""","""['Targeting of distinct signaling cascades and cancer-associated fibroblasts define the efficacy of Sorafenib against prostate cancer cells.', 'The multikinase inhibitor sorafenib induces caspase-dependent apoptosis in PC-3 prostate cancer cells.', 'Sorafenib induces growth inhibition and apoptosis in human synovial sarcoma cells via inhibiting the RAF/MEK/ERK signaling pathway.', 'Treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer: updates on therapeutics targeting the androgen receptor signaling pathway.', 'The role of cyclins in the development and progression of prostate cancer.', 'eEF2 improves dense connective tissue repair and healing outcome by regulating cellular death, autophagy, apoptosis, proliferation and migration.', 'Knockdown of lncRNA TP53TG1 Enhances the Efficacy of Sorafenib in Human Hepatocellular Carcinoma Cells.', 'Co-administration of tyrosine kinase inhibitors with rottlerin in metastatic prostate cancer cells.', 'Fibrinogen-Like Protein 1 Modulates Sorafenib Resistance in Human Hepatocellular Carcinoma Cells.', 'Combined Anti-Cancer Effects of Platycodin D and Sorafenib on Androgen-Independent and PTEN-Deficient Prostate Cancer.']"""

Nevertheless, the extent of the contribution of p53 dysfunction to PC remains unclear. Here we analyze the effects of p53 inhibition in PC cells and show that it has significant consequences for both the interaction between AR, and chromatin and the proliferative capacity of these cells. Inhibition of p53 expression enabled LNCaP cells to proliferate independently of androgens. Moreover, it modified the genome-wide binding pattern of AR. ChIP-sequnce analyis (ChIP-seq) revealed that fewer AR-binding sites were present in the context of p53 inhibition, suggesting that wild-type p53 is required for stable binding of AR to certain chromatin regions. Further analysis revealed that a lower AR occupancy was accompanied by a reduction in FoxA1 binding at regulatory regions of AR-dependent genes. Our study also identifies a pool of genes that may be transcriptionally regulated by AR only in the absence of p53, and that may contribute to the CRPC phenotype. Overall, our results point to p53 playing an important role in regulating AR activity across the genome.""","""['Natalya V Guseva', 'Oskar W Rokhlin', 'Thomas B Bair', 'Rebecca B Glover', 'Michael B Cohen']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['Elevated levels of FOXA1 facilitate androgen receptor chromatin binding resulting in a CRPC-like phenotype.', 'Overexpression of androgen receptor enhances the binding of the receptor to the chromatin in prostate cancer.', 'Cooperativity and equilibrium with FOXA1 define the androgen receptor transcriptional program.', 'Shaping Chromatin States in Prostate Cancer by Pioneer Transcription Factors.', 'Androgen receptor enhancer usage and the chromatin regulatory landscape in human prostate cancers.', 'Antrodia salmonea Extracts Regulate p53-AR Signaling and Apoptosis in Human Prostate Cancer LNCaP Cells.', 'Somatic Alterations Impact AR Transcriptional Activity and Efficacy of AR-Targeting Therapies in Prostate Cancer.', 'Diversity in Androgen Receptor Action Among Treatment-naïve Prostate Cancers Is Reflected in Treatment Response Predictions and Molecular Subtypes.', 'Androgen receptor co-regulation in prostate cancer.', 'Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma controls prostate cancer cell growth through AR-dependent and independent mechanisms.']"""

Previous studies have ascribed a protective role of cGMP signaling on hypoxia-mediated cancer progression. Herein, we determine their potential role in hypoxia-mediated chemoresistance and immune escape.  Materials and methods:   Phosphodiesterase assays were used to measure PDE activity in prostate cancer cell lines (DU145, PC3). Immunoblots were performed to determine the presence of PDEs in human prostate tissue samples. The effect of PDE inhibition on hypoxia-induced chemoresistance (compared to normoxic controls, 20% O2) was determined using clonogenic assays. Flow cytometry was used to determine the effects of PDE inhibition on surface MHC class I-related chain A (MICA), a natural killer (NK) cell-activating ligand. A mouse model was used to evaluate the in vivo effects of PDE inhibition on the growth of human prostate cancer cells.  Results:   PDE5 and PDE11 were the most prominent PDEs in the cell lines, representing between 86 and 95% of the total cGMP-specific PDE activity. Treatment of DU-145 cells with a PDE inhibitor significantly reduced the hypoxia-associated acquisition of resistance to doxorubicin, with a mean 51% reduction in surviving fraction compared to controls (p < 0.001, ANOVA). As well, PDE inhibition completely reversed (p = 0.02, ANOVA) hypoxia-induced shedding of the immune stimulatory molecule, MICA, and attenuated the growth of human prostate tumor xenografts in an NK cell-competent murine model (p = 0.03, Wilcoxon, Mann-Whitney).  Conclusions:   These results suggest a rationale for future studies on the potential therapeutic applications of PDE inhibitors in men with prostate cancer.""","""['Thomas K Hamilton', 'Nianping Hu', 'Klodiana Kolomitro', 'Erin N Bell', 'Donald H Maurice', 'Charles H Graham', 'D Robert Siemens']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""World J Urol""","""['Changes in phosphodiesterase activity in the developing rat submandibular gland.', 'The role of phosphodiesterase isoforms 2, 5, and 9 in the regulation of NO-dependent and NO-independent cGMP production in the rat cervical spinal cord.', 'Interaction between phosphodiesterases in the regulation of the cardiac β-adrenergic pathway.', 'Phosphodiesterase inhibitors in airways disease.', 'Cardiac Phosphodiesterases and Their Modulation for Treating Heart Disease.', 'The recent progress of myeloid-derived suppressor cell and its targeted therapies in cancers.', 'Cardio-oncology: Shared Genetic, Metabolic, and Pharmacologic Mechanism.', 'Low Expression of Phosphodiesterase 2 (PDE2A) Promotes the Progression by Regulating Mitochondrial Morphology and ATP Content and Predicts Poor Prognosis in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.', 'Identification of\xa0ISG15 and ZFP36 as novel hypoxia- and immune-related gene signatures contributing to a new perspective for the treatment of prostate cancer by bioinformatics and experimental verification.', 'Targeting myeloid-derived suppressor cells to enhance natural killer cell-based immunotherapy.']"""

TH-302, a hypoxia-activated prodrug selectively targeting hypoxic regions of solid tumors, delivers a cytotoxic warhead to the tumor, while maintaining relatively low systemic toxicity. The antitumor activity, different dosing sequences, and dosing regimens of TH-302 in combination with commonly used conventional chemotherapeutics were investigated in human tumor xenograft models.  Methods:   Seven chemotherapeutic drugs (docetaxel, cisplatin, pemetrexed, irinotecan, doxorubicin, gemcitabine, and temozolomide) were tested in combination with TH-302 in eleven human xenograft models, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), colon cancer, prostate cancer, fibrosarcoma, melanoma, and pancreatic cancer.  Results:   The antitumor activity of docetaxel, cisplatin, pemetrexed, irinotecan, doxorubicin, gemcitabine, and temozolomide was increased when combined with TH-302 in nine out of eleven models tested. Administration of TH-302 2-8 h prior to the other chemotherapeutics yielded superior efficacy versus other sequences tested. Simultaneous administration of TH-302 and chemotherapeutics increased toxicity versus schedules with dosing separations. In a dosing optimization study, TH-302 administered daily at 50 mg/kg intraperitoneally for 5 days per week in the H460 NSCLC model showed the optimal response with minimal toxicity.  Conclusions:   TH-302 enhances the activity of a wide range of conventional anti-neoplastic agents in a broad panel of in vivo xenograft models.

Few epidemiology studies have measured 25(OH)D on all participants, weakening the evidence-base through reduced statistical power and the potential for bias. We developed a score to predict individual 25(OH)D based on potential predictors, including sun exposure, nutrient intake, and vitamin D pathway genes, providing a method of substituting missing values. We assessed the usefulness of predicted 25(OH)D by comparison with multiple imputation of 25(OH)D levels.  Methods:   Amongst 1,091 controls from a population-based case-control study (ProtecT), we quantified relationships of sun exposure, demographic, clinical, anthropologic, nutrient, and genetic data with circulating 25(OH)D and constructed several prediction scores from subsets of these measures. We investigated associations of three prostate cancer risk factors (PSA level, BMI, family history of prostate cancer) with 25(OH)D levels in sensitivity analyses based upon participants with measured 25(OH)D only and based upon the addition of all participants with missing 25(OH)D levels substituted by prediction score values or by multiple imputation.  Results:   Our score accounted for 27.7% of the variation in measured 25(OH)D. Associations with risk factors of prostate cancer were consistent across the different estimates of 25(OH)D. However, standard deviations for the prediction score did not incorporate extra error from prediction. Multiple imputation of missing 25(OH)D values predicted a more realistic range of 25(OH)D.  Conclusion:   In epidemiological studies of cancer risk associated with vitamin D, multiple imputation of missing 25(OH)D is preferable to prediction scores, as a wider range of 25(OH)D levels are imputed and appropriate confidence intervals calculated.""","""['Rebecca Gilbert', 'Richard M Martin', 'William D Fraser', 'Sarah Lewis', 'Jenny Donovan', 'Freddie Hamdy', 'David E Neal', 'J Athene Lane', 'Chris Metcalfe']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Cancer Causes Control""","""['Associations of circulating retinol, vitamin E, and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D with prostate cancer diagnosis, stage, and grade.', 'Using genetic proxies for lifecourse sun exposure to assess the causal relationship of sun exposure with circulating vitamin d and prostate cancer risk.', 'Associations of circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D with prostate cancer diagnosis, stage and grade.', 'Relative importance of summer sun exposure, vitamin D intake, and genes to vitamin D status in Dutch older adults: The B-PROOF study.', 'The epidemiology of vitamin D and cancer incidence and mortality: a review (United States).', 'Active monitoring, radical prostatectomy and radical radiotherapy in PSA-detected clinically localised prostate cancer: the ProtecT three-arm RCT.', 'The Elderly-Nutrient Rich Food Score Is Associated With Biochemical Markers of Nutritional Status in European Older Adults.', 'Sex consideration in diet-biomarker-related indices: a systematic review.', 'Determinants of Plasma 25-Hydroxyvitamin D Concentrations among Breast Cancer Survivors in Korea.', 'Circulating vitamin D concentration and risk of prostate cancer: a dose-response meta-analysis of prospective studies.']"""

One aspect of inertial focusing that has not been studied is how particles suspended in whole or minimally diluted blood respond to inertial forces in microchannels. The utility of imaging techniques (i.e., high-speed bright-field imaging and long exposure fluorescence (streak) imaging) primarily used to observe particle focusing in microchannels is limited in complex fluids such as whole blood due to interference from the large numbers of red blood cells (RBCs). In this study, we used particle trajectory analysis (PTA) to observe the inertial focusing behavior of polystyrene beads, white blood cells, and PC-3 prostate cancer cells in physiological saline and blood. Identification of in-focus (fluorescently labeled) particles was achieved at mean particle velocities of up to 1.85 m s(-1). Quantitative measurements of in-focus particles were used to construct intensity maps of particle frequency in the channel cross-section and scatter plots of particle centroid coordinates vs. particle diameter. PC-3 cells spiked into whole blood (HCT = 45%) demonstrated a novel focusing mode not observed in physiological saline or diluted blood.

Methods and materials:   In this prospective study, 14 patients underwent adjuvant or salvage radiotherapy to the prostate bed under image guidance using linac-based kilovoltage cone-beam CT (kV-CBCT). Inter- and intrafraction uncertainty/motion was assessed by offline analysis of three consecutive daily kV-CBCT images of each patient: (1) after initial setup to skin marks, (2) after correction for positional error/immediately before radiation treatment, and (3) immediately after treatment.  Results:   The magnitude of interfraction PBM was 2.1 mm, and intrafraction PBM was 0.4 mm. The maximum inter- and intrafraction prostate bed motion was primarily in the anterior-posterior direction.

Conclusions:   PBM is a predominant source of intrafraction error compared with setup error and has implications for appropriate PTV margins. Based on inter- and estimated intrafraction motion of the prostate bed using pre- and post-kV-CBCT images, CBCT IGRT to correct for day-to-day variances can potentially reduce CTV-PTV margins by 1-2 mm.

We identified 21 factors that impacted patients' WTP, which largely centered on five major themes: altruism/desire to compare treatments, randomization, deference to physician opinion, financial incentives, and time demands/scheduling. Most patients (27 of 46, 59%) stated they would either ""definitely"" or ""probably"" participate. Seventeen percent (8 of 46) stated they would ""definitely not"" or ""probably not"" enroll, most of whom (6 of 8) preferred PBT before their physician visit.

The present study describes the preparation and evaluation of a series of new BN derivatives as potential tumor imaging agents.  Methods:   Several new BN derivatives with the common structure MAG(3)-X-BN(1-14 or 6-14), where X=Asp or Asp-Asp, were synthesized by solid-phase peptide synthesis. S-benzoylmercaptoacetic acid was incorporated at the end of synthesis via manual conjugation to yield MAG(3)-BN conjugates. Radiolabeling with (99m)Tc was accomplished by ligand exchange method. The receptor-binding affinity assays were performed in MDA-MB-231, MCF-7, T47-D and PC-3 cancer cell lines. In vivo biodistribution and clearance kinetics were assessed in Balb/c mice, and tumor targeting efficacy was determined in nude mice bearing breast tumor xenografts.  Results:   The peptides were prepared conveniently and radiolabeled efficiently with (99m)Tc (up to 95% labeling efficiency). In vitro cell binding assays demonstrated high affinity (values in the nanomolar range) of (99m)Tc peptides towards breast and prostate cancer cell lines. In addition, the radioconjugates displayed significant internalization (values ranged between 19% and 35%) in tumor cells. In vivo biodistribution and biokinetics are characterized by efficient clearance from the blood and variable degrees of excretion through the renal pathway. In vivo tumor targeting studies displayed variable uptake capacity of different BN derivatives, underlining the influence of specific amino acid sequence on tumor targeting profiles. Tumor uptake was always higher than the radioactivity in the blood and muscle, with good tumor retention and good tumor-to-blood and tumor-to-muscle ratios, indicating the potential of these agents for targeting tumors in vivo.  Conclusions:   The combination of favorable in vitro and in vivo properties may render these BN peptides as potential candidates for targeting BN/GRP receptor-positive tumors. They deserve further evaluation to determine their real strength. The present data indeed provide useful information regarding peptide structure-pharmacologic activity relationship, which might be useful in designing and developing new BN-like peptides for efficient targeting of tumors in vivo.""","""['Subhani M Okarvi', 'Ibrahim A Jammaz']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Nucl Med Biol""","""['PEGylation of (99m)Tc-labeled bombesin analogues improves their pharmacokinetic properties.', 'Design, preparation, in vitro and in vivo evaluation of (99m)Tc-N2S2-Tat(49-57)-bombesin: a target-specific hybrid radiopharmaceutical.', 'Spacer site modifications for the improvement of the in vitro and in vivo binding properties of (99m)Tc-N(3)S-X-bombesin2-14 derivatives.', '99mTc(v)O-Gly-Gly-Cys-Orn-Orn-Orn-Bombesin2-14.', '99mTc-labeled N40,Pro1,Tyr4bombesin.', 'A convenient and efficient total solid-phase synthesis of DOTA-functionalized tumor-targeting peptides for PET imaging of cancer.', 'HYNIC and DOMA conjugated radiolabeled bombesin analogs as receptor-targeted probes for scintigraphic detection of breast tumor.', 'Multivalent Ligand Binding to Cell Membrane Antigens: Defining the Interplay of Affinity, Valency, and Expression Density.', 'Radiolabeled bombesin derivatives for preclinical oncological imaging.', 'Evaluation of a new radiolabeled bombesin derivative with 99mTc as potential targeted tumor imaging agent.']"""

Design, setting, and participants:   A cohort of 1100 patients undergoing RC with pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND) without neoadjuvant therapy for urothelial carcinoma of the bladder between January 1, 1986, and December 2009 was evaluated. Patients with other than metastases to the pelvic lymph nodes were excluded. Median age was 65 yr. Clinical course, pathologic characteristics, and long-term outcomes were evaluated. Follow-up was obtained until December 2009 with a median of 38 mo and a completeness of 96.5%.  Intervention:   RC with PLND; urinary diversion with ileal neobladder whenever possible.  Measurements:   Primary end points were disease-specific survival (DSS), recurrence-free survival (RFS), and overall survival (OS) according to the tumor stage of the RC specimen versus the maximum tumor stage. The log-rank test was used to compare subgroups.  Results and limitations:   The 30-d (90-d) mortality rate was 3.2% (5.2%).

Methods:   The authors propose a three-stage postprocessing technique that can be applied to image volumes previously reconstructed by a cone-beam system. The stages are (1) segmentation of voxels into air, soft-tissue, and bone; (2) application of a 2D spatial-filter in the axial plane to the soft-tissue voxels; and (3) normalization to remove streaking along the axial-direction. The algorithm was tested on patient data acquired with Synergy XVI cone-beam CT systems (Elekta, Crawley, United Kingdom).  Results:   The computational demands of the suggested correction are small, taking less than 15 s per cone-beam reconstruction on a desktop PC.

Methods:   A series of six IMRT and VMAT treatment plans were generated, evaluated, and compared for two patient CT scans with dissimilar anatomies. Plans were generated for the prostate with and without the DIL. Plans were delivered using a Varian CLINAC and 2D dose distributions were measured using mapcheck(TM)-mapphan(TM) system. The effect of the prostate intrafractional motion on the delivery of the plans was studied by delivering the plans to the mapcheck(TM)-mapphan(TM) system on a programmable motion platform. Prostate intrafractional motion was simulated based on six different motion patterns from the literature obtained on Calypso system (Calypso System, Calypso Medical, Seattle, WA, USA) in a clinical study that provided continuous, real-time localization, and monitoring of the prostate. Absolute dose differences and Gamma analysis were used to assess the quality of a total of 42 plans with motion and without motion.  Results:   Dose escalation to the whole prostate from 76 to 86 Gy caused the rectum and bladder to exceed normal tissue tolerances in both patients. All the DIL boost plans satisfied the planning criteria and delivery quality assurance when motion was not present. For a single fraction, the motion pattern with large constant shift caused the largest dose delivery discrepancy with mean Gamma value (1.14-1.44) and the lowest plan passing percentage (18.9%-35.7%), while the motion pattern with continuous random changes during treatment had the least impact on dose delivery with mean Gamma value (0.33-0.55) and the highest passing percentage (81.9%-100%) for all the investigated plans. For dose escalation to DIL in the presence of intrafractional prostate motion, a significant difference was observed between the different motion patterns (p < 0.05), but no significant difference in the sensitivity to motion between the various plans was observed (p = 0.30). Based on Gamma analysis, treatment courses in which 15% of the fractions are dominated by severe motion proved to be significantly different from those dominated by random motion (p < 0.05).  Conclusions:   The impact of intrafractional prostate motion on dose delivery is sensitive to different motion patterns but not to different delivery techniques. Dose escalation to DIL using either sequential or simultaneous boost plans with 7 mm PTV margin is achievable in the presence of intrafractional prostate motion, even if the severe motion comprised 8.6% (3 out of the 35) treatment fractions.""","""['Ady Abdellatif', 'Jeff Craig', 'Michael Jensen', 'Matt Mulligan', 'Homeira Mosalaei', 'Glenn Bauman', 'Jeff Chen', 'Eugene Wong']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Effect of intrafractional prostate motion on simultaneous boost intensity-modulated radiotherapy to the prostate: a simulation study based on intrafractional motion in the prone position.', 'IMRT boost dose planning on dominant intraprostatic lesions: gold marker-based three-dimensional fusion of CT with dynamic contrast-enhanced and 1H-spectroscopic MRI.', 'Volumetric modulated arc therapy planning for primary prostate cancer with selective intraprostatic boost determined by 18F-choline PET/CT.', 'Radiotherapy Boost for the Dominant Intraprostatic Cancer Lesion-A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'Target motion management in breast cancer radiation therapy.', 'Dosimetric Evaluation of PSMA PET-Delineated Dominant Intraprostatic Lesion Simultaneous Infield Boosts.', 'A planning study of focal dose escalations to multiparametric MRI-defined dominant intraprostatic lesions in prostate proton radiation therapy.', 'Dosimetric impact of intrafraction motion on boosts on intraprostatic lesions: a simulation based on actual motion data from real time ultrasound tracking.', 'Quantification of the margin required for treating intraprostatic lesions.']"""

Methods:   A virtual water phantom was designed containing a single FM. Single and multi source scenarios were investigated by performing Monte Carlo dose calculations, along with the influence of varying orientation and distance of the FM with respect to the sources. Three prostate cancer patients treated with LDR brachytherapy for a recurrence following external beam radiotherapy with implanted FM were studied as surrogate cases to combined therapy. FM and brachytherapy seeds were identified on post implant CT scans and Monte Carlo dose calculations were performed with and without FM. The dosimetric impact of the FM was evaluated by quantifying the amplitude of dose shadows and the volume of cold spots. D(90) was reported based on the post implant CT prostate contour.  Results:   Large shadows are observed in the single source-FM scenarios. As expected from geometric considerations, the shadows are dependent on source-FM distance and orientation. Large dose reductions are observed at the distal side of FM, while at the proximal side a dose enhancement is observed. In multisource scenarios, the importance of shadows appears mitigated, although FM at the periphery of the seed distribution caused underdosage (<prescription dose). In clinical cases, the FM reduced the dose to some voxels by up to 50% and generated shadows with extents of the order of 4 mm. Within the prostate contour, cold spots (<95% prescription dose) of the order of 20 mm(3) were observed. D(90) proved insensitive to the presence of FM for the cases selected.

Methods:   At our institute, daily prostate positioning is routinely performed at the start of treatment beam using stereographic targeting (SGT). iSGT was implemented by extension of the SGT software to facilitate fast and accurate intrafraction motion corrections with minimal user interaction. iSGT entails megavoltage (MV) image acquisitions with the first segment of selected IMRT beams, automatic registration of implanted markers, followed by remote couch repositioning to correct for intrafraction motion above a predefined threshold, prior to delivery of the remaining segments. For a group of 120 patients, iSGT with corrections for two nearly lateral beams was evaluated in terms of workload and impact on effective intrafraction displacements in the sagittal plane.  Results:   SDs of systematic (Σ) and random (σ) displacements relative to the planning CT measured directly after initial SGT setup correction were <0.5 and <0.8 mm, respectively. Without iSGT corrections, effective Σ and σ for the 11-min treatments would increase to Σ(eff) < 1.1 mm and σ(eff) < 1.2 mm. With the iSGT procedure with an action level of 4 mm, effective positioning errors were reduced to Σ(eff) < 0.8 mm and σ(eff) < 1.0 mm, with 23.1% of all fractions requiring a correction. Computer simulations demonstrated that with an action level of 2 mm, the errors would have been reduced to Σ(eff) < 0.6 mm and σ(eff) < 0.7 mm, requiring corrections in 82.4% of the fractions. Because iSGT is highly automated, the extra time added by iSGT is <30 s if a correction is required.  Conclusions:   Without increasing imaging dose, iSGT successfully reduces intrafraction prostate motion with minimal workload and increase in fraction time.

Methods:   The authors vary the σ of the initial Gaussian size of the spot, from σ(x) = σ(y) = 3 mm to σ(x) = σ(y) = 8 mm, to evaluate the impact of the proton beam size on the quality of intensity modulated proton therapy (IMPT) plans. The distance between spots, Δx and Δy, is optimized on the spot plane, ranging from 4 to 12 mm (i.e., each spot size is coupled with the best spot grid resolution). In our Hyperion treatment planning system (TPS), constrained optimization is applied with respect to the organs at risk (OARs), i.e., the optimization tries to satisfy the dose objectives in the planning target volume (PTV) as long as all planning objectives for the OARs are met. Three-field plans for a nasopharynx case, two-field plans for a prostate case, and two-field plans for a malignant pleural mesothelioma case are considered in our analysis.  Results:   For the head and neck tumor, the best grids (i.e., distance between spots) are 5, 4, 6, 6, and 8 mm for σ = 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8 mm, respectively. σ ≤ 5 mm is required for tumor volumes with low dose and σ ≤ 4 mm for tumor volumes with high dose. For the prostate patient, the best grid is 4, 4, 5, 5, and 5 mm for σ = 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8 mm, respectively. Beams with σ > 3 mm did not satisfy our first clinical requirement that 95% of the prescribed dose is delivered to more than 95% of prostate and proximal seminal vesicles PTV. Our second clinical requirement, to cover the distal seminal vesicles PTV, is satisfied for beams as wide as σ = 6 mm. For the mesothelioma case, the low dose PTV prescription is well respected for all values of σ, while there is loss of high dose PTV coverage for σ > 5 mm. The best grids have a spacing of 6, 7, 8, 9, and 12 mm for σ = 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8 mm, respectively.  Conclusions:   The maximum acceptable proton pencil beam σ depends on the volume treated, the protocol of delivery, and optimization of the plan. For the clinical cases, protocol and optimization used in this analysis, acceptable σs are ≤ 4 mm for the head and neck tumor, ≤ 3 mm for the prostate tumor and ≤ 6 mm for the malignant pleural mesothelioma. One can apply the same procedure used in this analysis when given a ""class"" of patients, a σ and a clinical protocol to determine the optimal grid spacing.""","""['Lamberto Widesott', 'Antony J Lomax', 'Marco Schwarz']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Simultaneous beam geometry and intensity map optimization in intensity-modulated radiation therapy.', 'Comparison of linear and nonlinear programming approaches for ""worst case dose"" and ""minmax"" robust optimization of intensity-modulated proton therapy dose distributions.', 'Feasibility and robustness of dose painting by numbers in proton therapy with contour-driven plan optimization.', 'Vision 20/20: proton therapy.', 'Consensus Statement on Proton Therapy in Mesothelioma.', 'The influence of beam optics asymmetric distribution on dose in scanning carbon-ion radiotherapy.', 'Innovations and the Use of Collimators in the Delivery of Pencil Beam Scanning Proton Therapy.', 'Improving Head and Neck Cancer Treatments Using Dynamic Collimation in Spot Scanning Proton Therapy.', 'Proton therapy for non-squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck: planning comparison and toxicity.', 'Technical Note: Optimization of spot and trimmer position during dynamically collimated proton therapy.']"""

Objective:   Our objective was to investigate whether the prospective association between soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1) and cancer risk is modulated by n-3 PUFA intake.  Design:   A nested case-control study was designed to include all first-incident cancer cases diagnosed in the SUpplémentation en VItamines et Minéraux AntioXydants cohort between 1994 and 2007, with available dietary data from 24-h records (n = 408). Cases were matched with 1 or 2 randomly selected controls (n = 760). Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate ORs and 95% CIs for the association between prediagnostic plasma concentrations of sICAM-1 and cancer risk, stratified by n-3 PUFA intake. The interactions between sICAM-1 and n-3 PUFA intake were tested.  Results:   An interaction was observed between sICAM-1 and n-3 PUFA intake, which was consistent across the studied cancer locations (P-interaction = 0.036 for overall, 0.038 for breast, and 0.020 for prostate cancer risk). sICAM-1 concentrations were positively associated with cancer risk among subjects with n-3 PUFA intakes below the median (multivariate OR(Tertile3vsTertile1): 2.8; 95% CI: 1.5, 5.2; P-trend = 0.001), whereas this association was not observed for subjects with n-3 PUFA intakes above the median (OR(Tertile3vsTertile1): 1.3; 95% CI: 0.8, 2.3; P-trend = 0.3).

Prostate-derived Ets transcription factor (PDEF), a member of the Ets family, is reported to be present in tissues with high epithelial content, notably breast and prostate. However, the role of PDEF in cancer development is not fully understood. To gain insight into the molecular mechanisms associated with prostate cancer progression, we employed iTRAQ labeling followed by mass spectrometric (MS) analysis to identify candidate proteins that are differentially expressed in prostate cancer cells with or without PDEF. To this end, we overexpressed PDEF in PC3 human prostate cells using a tetracycline inducible system (Tet-On). Many differentially expressed proteins which play important roles in various cellular and biological processes were identified. Among them, stathmin (STMN), which is a microtubule (MT)-destabilizing protein, was found to be downregulated in multiple analyses. We demonstrated that re-expression of STMN reversed the antitumor properties of PDEF in PDEF-overexpressing PC3 cells. Using in vitro functional assays, we showed that STMN overexpression counteracted PDEF's effects against cell proliferation, colony formation and tumor migration. Similar results were further confirmed with the prostate cancer cell line CWR22rv1. In conclusion, many differentially expressed proteins were identified and STMN was found to be downregulated by PDEF. These results suggest that PDEF may inhibit prostate cancer progression by transcriptional downregulation of oncogenic STMN expression. Analyzing the association among differentially expressed proteins may provide a basis to better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the process of cancer progression and development and further aid in designing therapeutics in the future.""","""['Yamini Sabherwal', 'Nitin Mahajan', 'Donald L Helseth', 'Mayumi Gassmann', 'Heidi Shi', 'Ming Zhang']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Int J Oncol""","""['Signatures of prostate-derived Ets factor (PDEF) in cancer.', 'Proteomic analysis of a PDEF Ets transcription factor-interacting protein complex.', 'PDEF in prostate cancer.', 'Prostate derived ETS factor (PDEF): a putative tumor metastasis suppressor.', 'Pdef expression in human breast cancer is correlated with invasive potential and altered gene expression.', 'SPDEF suppresses head and neck squamous cell carcinoma progression by transcriptionally activating NR4A1.', 'PTEN loss promotes oncogenic function of STMN1 via PI3K/AKT pathway in lung cancer.', 'The androgen-induced protein AIbZIP facilitates proliferation of prostate cancer cells through downregulation of p21 expression.', ""Stathmin-dependent molecular targeting therapy for malignant tumor: the latest 5\xa0years' discoveries and developments."", 'Signatures of prostate-derived Ets factor (PDEF) in cancer.']"""

Trop-2 has been suggested to regulate cell-cell adhesion, given its high homology with the other member of the Trop family, Trop-1/EpCAM, and its ability to bind the tight junction proteins claudin-1 and claudin-7. However, a role for Trop-2 in cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix has never been postulated. Here, we show for the first time that Trop-2 expression in PrCa cells correlates with their aggressiveness. Using either shRNA-mediated silencing of Trop-2 in cells that endogenously express it, or ectopic expression of Trop-2 in cells that do not express it, we show that Trop-2 inhibits PrCa cell adhesion to fibronectin (FN). In contrast, expression of another transmembrane receptor, α(v) β(5) integrin, does not affect cell adhesion to this ligand. We find that Trop-2 does not modulate either protein or activation levels of the prominent FN receptors, β(1) integrins, but acts through increasing β(1) association with the adaptor molecule RACK1 and redistribution of RACK1 to the cell membrane. As a result of Trop-2 expression, we also observe activation of Src and FAK, known to occur upon β(1) -RACK1 interaction. These enhanced Src and FAK activities are not mediated by changes in either the activity of IGF-IR, which is known to bind RACK1, or IGF-IR's ability to associate with β(1) integrins. In summary, our data demonstrate that the transmembrane receptor Trop-2 is a regulator of PrCa cell adhesion to FN through activation of the β(1) integrin-RACK1-FAK-Src signaling axis.""","""['Marco Trerotola', 'Jing Li', 'Saverio Alberti', 'Lucia R Languino']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""J Cell Physiol""","""['RACK1, an insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) receptor-interacting protein, modulates IGF-I-dependent integrin signaling and promotes cell spreading and contact with extracellular matrix.', 'RACK1-mediated integration of adhesion and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) signaling and cell migration are defective in cells expressing an IGF-I receptor mutated at tyrosines 1250 and 1251.', 'Trop-2 promotes prostate cancer metastasis by modulating β(1) integrin functions.', 'The cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase 4D5 (PDE4D5)/receptor for activated C-kinase 1 (RACK1) signalling complex as a sensor of the extracellular nano-environment.', 'Integrins in cell adhesion and signaling.', 'An assembly of TROP2-mediated signaling events.', 'Overview of Trop-2 in Cancer: From Pre-Clinical Studies to Future Directions in Clinical Settings.', 'Expression and Therapeutic Targeting of TROP-2 in Treatment-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'A literature review of the promising future of TROP2: a potential drug therapy target.', 'Identification and Characterization of Specific Nanobodies against Trop-2 for Tumor Targeting.']"""

In the current study, cell cycle profiles of normal proliferating human umbilical vein endothelial cells, prostate cancer, and lung cancer cell lines expressing varying levels of survivin and its splice variants were compared using a novel functional complementation assay. Defects in chromosome segregation and cytokinesis that were observed after depletion of endogenous survivin were not complemented by any of the survivin splice variants: survivin-2B, survivin-3B, survivin-ΔEx3, or survivin-2A when expressed exogenously at a level comparable to endogenous full-length survivin. Survivin variants were not detectable at the endogenous protein level. Cancer cells with higher levels of full-length survivin and survivin-2B expression, exhibited reduced caspase-3 activation following doxorubicin treatment and radiation. Whereas earlier studies focused on function and expression levels of survivin specific to cancer cells, the current study brings forward the essential role of survivin in normal dividing cells.

MMP2/TIMP2 system has a significant impact on the development and progression of cancer and genetic polymorphisms in the promoters of MMP2 (-1306C/T, 735C/T) and TIMP2 (-418G/A, -303C/T) are correlated with decreased enzyme activity. We sought to determine whether genetic polymorphisms in MMP2 and TIMP2 polymorphisms may be associated with varying risk of prostate cancer (PCa) in men in North India.  Methods:   Genotyping was done by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism method in 190 histologically confirmed PCa patients and 200 unrelated, healthy, age-matched individuals of similar ethnicity.  Results:   Patients with MMP2 (-1306) CT genotype as well as T allele were at higher risk of PCa (p = 0.018; OR = 1.68 and p = 0.015; OR = 1.52). This effect was even more evident in the case of the T allele carrier (CT + TT) (p = 0.011; OR = 1.71). MMP2 (735) C>T, TIMP2 (-418) G>C and TIMP2 (-303) C>T polymorphism demonstrated no association. However, TIMP2 (-418) GC was found to be involved in progression of PCa but not in initiation. Haplotype results demonstrated that MMP2 (1306T-735C) and TIMP2 (418G-303T) were associated with a 1.5- and 1.8-fold increased risk, respectively.  Conclusions:   Our data indicated that MMP2-1306C>T gene polymorphism contributes to PCa susceptibility. These findings suggested MMP2 variants as a predictor of PCa progression risk among North Indian men. We assume that analysis of these gene polymorphisms can help identify patient subgroups at high risk of poor disease outcome.""","""['Priyanka Srivastava', 'Tasleem A Lone', 'Rakesh Kapoor', 'Rama Devi Mittal']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Arch Med Res""","""['Association of polymorphism in matrix metalloproteinase-2 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 with genetic susceptibility of gastric cancer.', 'The role of genetic polymorphisms in the promoters of the matrix metalloproteinase-2 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 genes in head and neck cancer.', 'Substantial reduction in risk of breast cancer associated with genetic polymorphisms in the promoters of the matrix metalloproteinase-2 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 genes.', 'Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) -2, -7 and -9 promoter polymorphisms in colorectal cancer in ethnic Kashmiri population - A case-control study and a mini review.', 'Association between MMP2-1306 C/T polymorphism and prostate cancer susceptibility: a meta-analysis based on 3906 subjects.', 'Identification of TIMP2 as a Prognostic Biomarker and Its Correlation with Tumor Immune Microenvironment: A Comprehensive Pan-Cancer Analysis.', 'OTX1 promotes tumorigenesis and progression of cervical cancer by regulating the Wnt signaling pathway.', 'The Role of the Metzincin Superfamily in Prostate Cancer Progression: A Systematic-Like Review.', 'Glucose Transporter 1 Promotes the Malignant Phenotype of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer through Integrin β1/Src/FAK Signaling.', 'Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-2 Polymorphisms and Risk for HIV-Associated Neurocognitive Disorder.']"""

However, it is the molecular characterization of CTCs that offers insight into the biology of these tumor cells in the context of personalized treatment.  Methods:   We developed a novel approach to isolate CTCs away from hematopoietic cells with high purity, enabling genomic analysis of these cells. The isolation protocol involves immunomagnetic enrichment followed by fluorescence activated cell sorting (IE/FACS). To evaluate the feasibility of isolation of CTCs by IE/FACS and downstream genomic profiling, we conducted a pilot study in patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Twenty (20) sequential CRPC patients were assayed using CellSearch™. Twelve (12) patients positive for CTCs were subjected to immunomagnetic enrichment and fluorescence activated cell sorting (IE/FACS) to isolate CTCs. Genomic DNA of CTCs was subjected to whole genome amplification (WGA) followed by gene copy number analysis via array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH).  Results:   CTCs from nine (9) patients successfully profiled were observed to have multiple copy number aberrations including those previously reported in primary prostate tumors such as gains in 8q and losses in 8p. High-level copy number gains at the androgen receptor (AR) locus were observed in 7 (78%) cases. Comparison of genomic profiles between CTCs and archival primary tumors from the same patients revealed common lineage. However, high-level copy number gains in the AR locus were observed in CTCs, but not in the matched archival primary tumors.  Conclusions:   We developed a new approach to isolate prostate CTCs without significant leukocyte admixture, and to subject them to genome-wide copy number analysis.

What's known on the subject? and What does the study add? ADIPOSE tissue secretes various endocrine and paracrine mediators. Some authors have begun to consider whether peri-prostatic fat (PPF) may interact with the prostate and play a role in carcinogenesis. It has recently been shown that the PPF quantity measured by CT is associated with more aggressive disease in patients undergoing radiation therapy. Our group studied a population not yet diagnosed with prostate cancer. By doing so we were able to identify PPF thickness on transrectal ultrasonography as a risk factor for prostate cancer detection upon biopsy, and as a risk factor for high-grade disease. Our study also raises interesting questions about the underlying mechanisms of the association between PPF quantity and prostate cancer.  Objective:   To determine if the amount of peri-prostatic fat (PPF) on transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS) is a risk factor for incident prostate cancer overall and high-grade prostate cancer (Gleason ≥4).  Patients and methods:   A prospectively maintained database of patients undergoing prostate biopsy at Princess Margaret Hospital for cancer suspicion was used. • All TRUS examinations were retrospectively reviewed upon 'blinding' to outcome. • PPF thickness, measured as the distance between the prostate and the pubic bone, was used as an index of the quantity of PPF. • PPF measurements, together with other prostate cancer risk factors, were evaluated against prostate cancer and high-grade prostate cancer detection upon biopsy with univariable and multivariable logistic regression and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) analysis.  Results:   Of the 931 patients, 434 (47%) were diagnosed with prostate cancer and 218 (23%) were diagnosed with high-grade prostate cancer. • The mean (range) PPF thickness was 5.3 (0-15) mm. • Increasing PPF thickness was associated with prostate cancer and high-grade prostate cancer diagnosis, with graded effect. When adjusting for other variables, the odds of detecting any prostate cancer and high-grade prostate cancer increased 12% (odds ratio [OR] 1.12, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02-1.23) and 20% (OR 1.20, 95% CI 1.07-1.34), respectively, for each millimetre increase in PPF thickness. • The AUCs for the association of PPF with prostate cancer and high-grade prostate cancer were 0.58 (95% CI 0.54-0.62) and 0.59 (95% CI 0.55-0.64), respectively.  Conclusion:   The amount of PPF can be estimated with TRUS and is a predictor of prostate cancer and high-grade prostate cancer at biopsy.

The experience with HIFU as a minimally invasive treatment for localized prostate cancer is relatively new and most reports are from European centres. Our study is unique in five regards: 1. Data was collected prospectively. 2. All patients were treated with contemporary technology. 3. Outcomes are reported after a single HIFU session using two definitions of biochemical failure that have the ability to predict longer-term clinical failure after primary ablative therapies for prostate cancer (Stuttgart definition for HIFU and Horwitz definition for radiation). 4. All patients were treated in a single centre. 5. No patients underwent peri-HIFU TURP. The present study represents the largest North American prospective cohort of primary HIFU for prostate cancer with mid-term oncological outcome data.  Objective:   To assess 4-year biochemical failure (BCF) rates in patients after high-intensity focused ultrasonography (HIFU) treatment using the Horwitz and Stuttgart definitions.  Patients and methods:   A total of 447 consecutive patients were treated with a single session of HIFU between May 2005 and December 2010. Follow-up included prostate-specific antigen (PSA) measurement every 3 months during the first year and every 6 months thereafter. Patients who had previously received radiation, androgen deprivation or HIFU therapy, and patients with <2 consecutive PSA measurements were excluded. BCF was reported using the Stuttgart (PSA nadir + 1.2 ng/mL rising) and the Horwitz (two consecutive increases of at least 0.5 ng/mL) definitions.  Results:   In all, 402 patients met the inclusion criteria and the median (range) follow-up was 24 (6-48) months. Of these patients, 183 (45.5%) had low and 219 (54.5%) had intermediate D'Amico's risk stratification disease. Mean and median absolute PSA nadir levels were 0.36 ± 0.69 and 0.1 ng/mL (Q(1):0, Q(3):0.37), respectively and these were achieved in median time of 3 months. Overall 4-year mean (range) BCF-free rates were 68 (61-75)% and 72 (68-77)% according to the Stuttgart and Horwitz definitions at 4 years, respectively. Mean (range) BCF-free rates were significantly higher for a PSA nadir ≤0.5 ng/mL and prostate volume ≤30 mL for both definitions at 4-year follow-up [Stuttgart: 79 (72-86)% vs. 25 (13-38)%; Horwitz: 82 (77-87)% vs. 33 (21-44)%] and [Stuttgart: 72 (64-79)% vs. 56 (42-69)%; Horwitz: 75 (69-80)% vs. 63 (53-74)%], respectively. Pre-treatment PSA and PSA nadir of >0.5 ng/mL were the predictors of BCF using both definitions.

Resulting mortality, however, is low since most prostatic cancers are slow-growing, non-lethal tumours. The introduction of PSA screening has profoundly impacted on the epidemiology of prostate cancer. Men bearing aggressive disease are diagnosed sooner so that radical treatment can be applied more effectively. But PSA screening also unveil many indolent cancers that would have not threaten the patient if left undiscovered. Systematic treatment of indolent cancers may result into many men being exposed to unwanted side effects. For this reason, the true benefit of PSA screening is still a matter of intense debate.

To better understand the normal function of CD44, we have investigated its role in mouse mammary gland development and its expression in human breast and prostate cancer. We have found that CD44 is expressed in the myoepithelium of the developing mammary gland and modulates ductal development of FVB/N mice. The loss of CD44 results in defective luminal-myoepithelial cell-cell adhesion and promotes the mixing of luminal and myoepithelial layers, disrupting epithelial bilayer organization, and CD44-null mice experience delayed ductal outgrowth and impaired terminal end bud formation. The myoepithelial expression of CD44 is also relevant to its expression in cancer, as CD44 is expressed in the basal cells of early-stage breast and prostate cancer but exhibits altered localization with increasing tumorigenicity and is strongly expressed by tumor epithelium.""","""['Jeanne M V Louderbough', 'Jessie A Brown', 'Ray B Nagle', 'Joyce A Schroeder']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Genes Cancer""","""['Asymmetric expression of connexins between luminal epithelial- and myoepithelial- cells is essential for contractile function of the mammary gland.', 'Transcriptome analysis of mammary epithelial subpopulations identifies novel determinants of lineage commitment and cell fate.', 'P190A RhoGAP is required for mammary gland development.', 'Mammary gland development: Role of basal myoepithelial cells.', 'Application of the D492 Cell Lines to Explore Breast Morphogenesis, EMT and Cancer Progression in 3D Culture.', 'Local Delivery and Glioblastoma: Why Not Combining Sustained Release and Targeting?', 'Epsilon-aminocaproic acid prevents high glucose and insulin induced-invasiveness in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, modulating the plasminogen activator system.', 'Aberrant Splicing of Estrogen Receptor, HER2, and CD44 Genes in Breast Cancer.', 'Characterization of Epithelial Progenitors in Normal Human Palatine Tonsils and Their HPV16 E6/E7-Induced Perturbation.', 'Utilization of Glycosaminoglycans/Proteoglycans as Carriers for Targeted Therapy Delivery.']"""

In this study, we have investigated the enhancement of the therapeutic impact of valrubicin (AD-32), an antineoplastic agent that has been limited to intravesicular application against bladder cancer, despite the encouraging original preclinical data. Earlier studies validated the superior therapeutic efficacy of AD-32 over doxorubicin. In the present study, rHDL/AD-32 nanoparticles were formulated and characterized with regard to encapsulation efficiency, physicochemical properties, selective toxicity, and receptor-mediated uptake. The half maximal inhibitory concentration values (IC(50)) for rHDL/AD-32 nanoparticles were 1.8 and 2.6 times lower than the free AD-32 for prostate (PC-3) and ovarian (SKOV-3) cancer cell lines, respectively, whereas nonmalignant cell lines demonstrated 5 and 1.48 times higher IC(50) doses with rHDL/AD-32 formulations. The data obtained demonstrated effective receptor- mediated uptake of AD-32 from the rHDL nanocarriers by PC-3 and SKOV-3 cancer cells via a targeted drug-delivery process. The rHDL/AD-32 formulation was stable for 6 months when stored at 4°C or at -20°C, as 92% of the AD-32 was retained in the nanoparticles.

In addition, reports suggest that diltiazem induces cell death, which could make it a drug of choice for the treatment of cancer associated with hypertension. The goal of this research was to determine whether diltiazem is capable of inducing apoptosis in prostate cancer cells, either alone or in combination with the proteasome inhibitors, lactacystin and bortezomib (Velcade). Bortezomib is approved for the treatment of multiple myeloma; unfortunately, it has side effects that limit its utility. Presumably these side effects could be decreased by reducing its dose in combination with another drug. We have previously shown that lactacystin induces apoptosis in LNCaP cells; here, we show that this effect was enhanced by diltiazem. Furthermore, in proteasome inhibitor-resistant DU145 cells, diltiazem alone did not induce apoptosis but decreased cytosolic calcium levels and induced mitochondrial fission; likewise, lactacystin did not induce apoptosis but up-regulated the proapoptotic protein Bik. However, increasing concentrations of diltiazem in combination with lactacystin or bortezomib induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent and synergistic manner. The combination of diltiazem and lactacystin also up-regulated the levels of Bik and released Bak from Bcl-xL, indicating the involvement of the Bcl2 family pathway in this apoptosis. In addition, the drug combination up-regulated GRP78, suggesting also the involvement of endoplasmic reticulum stress in the apoptotic response.

In vivo mouse model tumor studies using the total prostate epithelial knockout mice (pes-ARKO) also revealed that AR played a suppressive role in proliferation of the CK5(+)/CK8(+) progenitor/intermediate cells but a positive role in the CK5(-)/CK8(+) luminal epithelial cells. Using three different resources (one human basal epithelial cell line, one mouse basal epithelial originated progenitor cell line, and a basal epithelium-specific ARKO mouse model), we here demonstrated that the AR in basal epithelial cells of normal prostate plays a suppressive role in their proliferation but a positive role in differentiation into luminal epithelial cells. These results led us to conclude that ARs may play a negative role to suppress CK5(+) basal epithelial and progenitor cell proliferation, yet play an essential role to drive basal epithelial cells into more differentiated states. These results may explain why differential AR expression in different cell types within normal prostate is needed and suggest that ARs in prostate basal epithelial cells, although expressed at a very low level, are necessary to maintain the balance between progenitor cells and differentiated luminal epithelial cells.""","""['Soo Ok Lee', 'Jing Tian', 'Chiung-Kuei Huang', 'Zhifang Ma', 'Kuo-Pao Lai', 'HsiMin Hsiao', 'Ming Jiang', 'Shuyuan Yeh', 'Chawnshang Chang']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""J Endocrinol""","""['Increased prostate cell proliferation and loss of cell differentiation in mice lacking prostate epithelial androgen receptor.', 'Increased CK5/CK8-positive intermediate cells with stromal smooth muscle cell atrophy in the mice lacking prostate epithelial androgen receptor.', 'Stem/progenitor and intermediate cell types and the origin of human prostate cancer.', 'Concise review: androgen receptor differential roles in stem/progenitor cells including prostate, embryonic, stromal, and hematopoietic lineages.', 'Differentiation pathways and histogenetic aspects of normal and abnormal prostatic growth: a stem cell model.', 'Bipolar Androgen Therapy: When Excess Fuel Extinguishes the Fire.', 'The Role of Epigenetic Change in Therapy-Induced Neuroendocrine Prostate Cancer Lineage Plasticity.', 'Bipotent Progenitors Do Not Require Androgen Receptor for Luminal Specification during Prostate Organogenesis.', 'From genomics to functions: preclinical mouse models for understanding oncogenic pathways in prostate cancer.', 'YAP1 regulates prostate cancer stem cell-like characteristics to promote castration resistant growth.']"""

We carried out a phase 1 dose-escalation study of the alkylating agent melphalan with autologous stem cell transplantation, comparing rapid changes in circulating tumor cells (CTC) and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) as a measure of response.  Experimental design:   Cohorts of individuals with advanced CRPC received high-dose intravenous melphalan, and autologous blood was returned to patients during treatment. The efficacy endpoints were the PSA reduction rate, CTC response, survival parameters, toxicity and whether reinduction of endocrine sensitivity occurred.  Results:   Twenty-four patients were recruited. Dose escalation was feasible with the highest dose cohort being reached. Of 23 individuals evaluable for response, 16 had a PSA response of more than 30%; of 11 patients with soft tissue disease, 4 achieved a partial response and 7 had stable disease. Patients with CTC counts that decreased to less than 5 within 2 weeks from the start of therapy had a longer overall survival (30.6 months vs. 15.3 months, P = 0.03) Treatment was associated with myelosuppression and frequent hospitalizations. In 20 patients after the study, hormone therapy was reintroduced when PSA increased again; response rates were high.  Conclusions:   Autologous transplantation following high-dose alkylating agent chemotherapy induces responses but proved toxic, although dose escalation proved possible. The possibility of using CTCs to identify responders at two weeks may be used to justify such an intensive approach.

Methods:   Within the Health Care Utilization Project Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS), the authors focused on RPs performed within the 7 most contemporary years (2001-2007). They tested rates of in-hospital mortality, intraoperative complications, postoperative complications, and blood transfusions as well as the mean length of stay (LOS), stratified according to the number of LVTs that were met. Multivariable regression analyses were adjusted further for potential confounders.  Results:   Overall, 36.2%, 17.3%, 14.9%, 15.7%, 12.9%, and 3% of RPs were performed at institutions that reached 0 LVT, 1 LVT, 2 LVTs, 3 LVTs, 4 LVTs, and 5 LVTs, respectively. Relative to patients who underwent RP at institutions that reached 0 LVTs, patients who underwent RP at institutions that reached 5 LVTs had fewer comorbidities, were younger, were more likely to hold private insurance, and were more likely to undergo concomitant pelvic lymphadenectomy (all P < .001). In multivariable analyses adjusted for hospital volume (HV), age, race, year of surgery, Charlson Comorbidity Index, hospital region and location, pelvic lymphadenectomy, and insurance status, LVT status was related inversely to LOS and the likelihood of receiving blood transfusions (both P < .001).  Conclusions:   The current results indicated that LVTs can provide a highly accurate prediction of the probability of 2 important, detrimental, short-term outcomes after RP, even after accounting for HV. The benefit at institutions that meet LVTs may exceed that at other institutions when short-term RP outcomes are considered.

This study compared PSA velocity (PSAV) and PSADT to predict 11C choline PET/CT findings.  Materials and methods:   PSAV and PSADT were retrospectively calculated in 170 PCa patients with biochemical failure after radical prostatectomy, who underwent 11C choline PET/CT for restaging of disease.  Results:   Median PSA was 1.25 ng/mL (range: 0.23-48.6 ng/mL), and median PSAV was 0.99 ng/mL/y (range: 0.11-98.9 ng/mL/y). Patients with positive 11C choline PET/CT (n = 75) had significantly (P < 0.05) higher PSAV than patients with negative 11C choline PET/CT (n = 95) (6.93 ± 13.08 vs. 1.23 ± 2.03 ng/mL/y). The percent of patients with positive 11C choline PET/CT was 21% for PSAV <1 ng/mL/y, 56% for PSAV between 1 and 2 ng/mL/y, and 76% for PSAV >2 ng/mL/y. The quality of fitting (r2) of PSA values according to the exponential function (PSADT) was significantly (P < 0.05) better than the quality of fitting according to the linear function (PSAV) in the entire sample and in all anatomic regions. At multivariate analysis, trigger PSA, PSADT but not PSAV obtained the statistical significance (P < 0.05).  Conclusions:   PSAV can be used to stratify the risk of positive 11C choline PET/CT in PCa patients with biochemical failure. Patients with PSAV >1 ng/mL/y should be selected to increase the positive detection rate of 11C choline PET/CT.

Twenty-six patients treated with EBRT plus vaccine returned for follow-up, and we reviewed the most recent labs and clinical notes of the remaining patients.  Results:   Median follow-up for the S-IL-2, M-IL-2 and EBRT-alone groups was 98, 76 and 79 months, respectively. Actuarial 5-year PSA failure-free probability was 78%, 82% and 86% (P=0.58 overall), respectively. There were no significant differences between the actuarial overall survival and the prostate cancer-specific survival between the two vaccine arms. Of the 26 patients who returned for follow-up, Radiation Therapy Oncology Group grade ≥2 genitourinary (GU) and gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity was seen in 19% and 8%, respectively, with no difference between the arms (P=1.00 and P=0.48 for grade ≥2 GU and GI toxicity, respectively). In all, 12 patients were evaluated for PSA-specific immune responses, and 1 demonstrated a response 66 months post-enrollment.  Conclusions:   We demonstrate that vaccine combined with EBRT does not appear to have significant differences with regard to PSA control or late-term toxicity compared with standard treatment. We also found limited evidence of long-term immune response following vaccine therapy.""","""['M Kamrava', 'A H Kesarwala', 'R A Madan', 'E Lita', 'A Kaushal', 'K-Y Tsang', 'D J Poole', 'S M Steinberg', 'T Ferrara', 'W Dahut', 'J Schlom', 'J L Gulley']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['Safety and immunologic response of a viral vaccine to prostate-specific antigen in combination with radiation therapy when metronomic-dose interleukin 2 is used as an adjuvant.', 'Acute genitourinary toxicity after high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy combined with hypofractionated external-beam radiation therapy for localized prostate cancer: correlation between the urethral dose in HDR brachytherapy and the severity of acute genitourinary toxicity.', 'Combining a recombinant cancer vaccine with standard definitive radiotherapy in patients with localized prostate cancer.', 'Preliminary toxicity and prostate-specific antigen response of a Phase I/II trial of neoadjuvant hormonal therapy, 103Pd brachytherapy, and three-dimensional conformal external beam irradiation in the treatment of locally advanced prostate cancer.', ""High-dose-rate intensity-modulated brachytherapy with external beam radiotherapy for prostate cancer: California endocurietherapy's 10-year results."", 'Interaction Between Modern Radiotherapy and Immunotherapy for Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Cancer Vaccines for Genitourinary Tumors: Recent Progresses and Future Possibilities.', 'Radiation therapy and immunotherapy: what is the optimal timing or sequencing?', 'Radiation and Anti-Cancer Vaccines: A Winning Combination.', 'Combination regimens of radiation therapy and therapeutic cancer vaccines: mechanisms and opportunities.']"""

Here we show that the microRNAs miR-130a, miR-203 and miR-205 jointly interfere with the two major oncogenic pathways in prostate carcinoma and are downregulated in cancer tissue. Using transcriptomics we show that the microRNAs repress several gene products known to be overexpressed in this cancer. Argonaute 2 (AGO2) co-immunoprecipitation, reporter assays and western blot analysis demonstrate that the microRNAs directly target several components of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and androgen receptor (AR) signaling pathways, among those several AR coregulators and HRAS (Harvey rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog), and repress signaling activity. Both pathways are central for the development of the primary tumor and in particular the progression to its incurable castration-resistant form. Reconstitution of the microRNAs in LNCaP PCa cells induce morphological changes, which resemble the effect of androgen deprivation, and jointly impair tumor cell growth by induction of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. We therefore propose that these microRNAs jointly act as tumor suppressors in prostate carcinoma and might interfere with progression to castration resistance.""","""['K Boll', 'K Reiche', 'K Kasack', 'N Mörbt', 'A K Kretzschmar', 'J M Tomm', 'G Verhaegh', 'J Schalken', 'M von Bergen', 'F Horn', 'J Hackermüller']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['miR-124 and Androgen Receptor Signaling Inhibitors Repress Prostate Cancer Growth by Downregulating Androgen Receptor Splice Variants, EZH2, and Src.', 'Involvement of aberrantly activated HOTAIR/EZH2/miR-193a feedback loop in progression of prostate cancer.', 'miR-326 functions as a tumor suppressor in human prostatic carcinoma by targeting Mucin1.', 'The transcriptional regulation of miR-21, its multiple transcripts, and their implication in prostate cancer.', 'Androgen action in the prostate gland.', 'Plasmatic MicroRNAs and Treatment Outcomes of Patients with Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: A Hospital-Based Cohort Study and In Silico Analysis.', 'Post-transcriptional modification of m6A methylase METTL3 regulates ERK-induced androgen-deprived treatment resistance prostate cancer.', 'MicroRNA in adenoid cystic carcinoma (Review).', 'microRNA-205 in prostate cancer: Overview to clinical translation.', 'Association of Androgenic Regulation and MicroRNAs in Acinar Adenocarcinoma of Prostate.']"""

One finding revealed that Cdk9 and Cdk7 could substitute each other in RNA polII CTD phosphorylation in contrast to the in vitro system. Thus, a simultaneous inhibition of Cdk9 and Cdk7 might be required both for targeting malignant cells and developing a platform for microarray analysis. However, these two pathways are not redundant, as indicated by differential effects observed in cell cycle regulation following siRNA-mediated inhibition of Cdk9 and/or Cdk7 in human PC3 prostate cancer cell line. Specifically, siRNA-mediated inhibition of Cdk9 caused a shift from G 0/G 1 to G 2/M phase in human PC3 prostate cancer cell line. Another finding showed that flavopiridol treatment induced a substantial AKT-Ser473 phosphorylation in human glioblastoma T98G cell line in contrast to siRNA-mediated inhibition of Cdk9 and Cdk9 combined with Cdk7, whereas siRNA-mediated silencing of Cdk7 caused a minor increase in AKT-Ser473 phosphorylation.

This study aimed to elucidate the link between elevated expression of p110δ PI3K and cancer. We report that in breast and prostate cancer cells that contain leukocyte levels of p110δ, p110δ activity dampens the activity of the PTEN tumor suppressor. Indeed, inactivation of p110δ in these cells led to PTEN activation, suppression of Akt phosphorylation, and inhibition of cell proliferation, with inhibition of PTEN activity being able to counterbalance p110δ inactivation. Likewise, forced overexpression of p110δ in cells with low p110δ expression reduced PTEN activity, resulting in increased Akt phosphorylation. Our data indicate that the oncogenic potential of p110δ PI3K overexpression might at least partially act through PTEN inactivation, and that p110δ-selective PI3K inhibitors can have a dual antitumor mechanism, namely by directly inhibiting p110δ signaling and by a broader inhibition of class I PI3K activity through PTEN activation.

The CAD method consists of multiple sequential steps in order to detect locations that are suspicious for prostate cancer. In the initial stage, a voxel classification is performed using a Hessian-based blob detection algorithm at multiple scales on an apparent diffusion coefficient map. Next, a parametric multi-object segmentation method is applied and the resulting segmentation is used as a mask to restrict the candidate detection to the prostate. The remaining candidates are characterized by performing histogram analysis on multiparametric MR images. The resulting feature set is summarized into a malignancy likelihood by a supervised classifier in a two-stage classification approach. The detection performance for prostate cancer was tested on a screening population of 200 consecutive patients and evaluated using the free response operating characteristic methodology. The results show that the CAD method obtained sensitivities of 0.41, 0.65 and 0.74 at false positive (FP) levels of 1, 3 and 5 per patient, respectively. In conclusion, this study showed that it is feasible to automatically detect prostate cancer at a FP rate lower than systematic biopsy.

Patients and methods:   The patients' baseline demographic, clinical, and oncologic parameters were prospectively recorded. The study end points included oncologic outcome, functional outcomes (at 3 months), and perioperative parameters. Complications were classified according to the modified Clavien system.  Results:   No statistically significant differences were noted between the two groups in terms of preoperative patient characteristics and oncologic parameters.

It is a member of the tetraspan transmembrane superfamily (TM4SF) of membrane glycoproteins. As part of a tetraspanin-enriched microdomain (TEM), KAI1 inhibits tumor metastasis by negative regulation of Src. However, the underlying regulatory mechanism has not yet been fully elucidated. CUB-domain-containing protein 1 (CDCP1), which was previously known as tetraspanin-interacting protein in TEM, promoted metastasis via enhancement of Src activity. To better understand how KAI1 is involved in the negative regulation of Src, we here examined the function of KAI1 in CDCP1-mediated Src kinase activation and the consequences of this process, focusing on HIF-1 α and VEGF expression.  Methods:   We used the human prostate cancer cell line PC3 which was devoid of KAI1 expression. Vector-transfected cells (PC3-GFP clone #8) and KAI1-expressing PC3 clones (PC3-KAI1 clone #5 and #6) were picked after stable transfection with KAI1 cDNA and selection in 800 μg/ml G418. Protein levels were assessed by immunoblotting and VEGF reporter gene activity was measured by assaying luciferase activitiy. We followed tumor growth in vivo and immunohistochemistry was performed for detection of HIF-1, CDCP1, and VHL protein level.  Results:   We demonstrated that Hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) and VEGF expression were significantly inhibited by restoration of KAI1 in PC3 cells. In response to KAI1 expression, CDCP1-enhanced Src activation was down-regulated and the level of von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) protein was significantly increased. In an in vivo xenograft model, KAI1 inhibited the expression of CDCP1 and HIF-1α.  Conclusions:   These novel observations may indicate that KAI1 exerts profound metastasis-suppressor activity in the tumor malignancy process via inhibition of CDCP1-mediated Src activation, followed by VHL-induced HIF-1α degradation and, ultimately, decreased VEGF expression.""","""['Jung-Jin Park', 'Yeung Bae Jin', 'Yoon-Jin Lee', 'Jae-Seon Lee', 'Yun-Sil Lee', 'Young-Gyu Ko', 'Minyoung Lee']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['HIF-1alpha, STAT3, CBP/p300 and Ref-1/APE are components of a transcriptional complex that regulates Src-dependent hypoxia-induced expression of VEGF in pancreatic and prostate carcinomas.', 'Prolyl hydroxylase 2 dependent and Von-Hippel-Lindau independent degradation of Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 and 2 alpha by selenium in clear cell renal cell carcinoma leads to tumor growth inhibition.', 'Requirement of the p130CAS-Crk coupling for metastasis suppressor KAI1/CD82-mediated inhibition of cell migration.', 'KAI1/CD82, a tumor metastasis suppressor.', 'Roles of CUB domain-containing protein 1 signaling in cancer invasion and metastasis.', 'Confinement of unliganded EGFR by tetraspanin nanodomains gates EGFR ligand binding and signaling.', 'KAI1(CD82) is a key molecule to control angiogenesis and switch angiogenic milieu to quiescent state.', 'CD82 Suppresses ADAM17-Dependent E-Cadherin Cleavage and Cell Migration in Prostate Cancer.', 'An oncogenic viral interferon regulatory factor upregulates CUB domain-containing protein 1 to promote angiogenesis by hijacking transcription factor lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1 and metastasis suppressor CD82.', 'c-Src is required for hypoxia-induced metastasis-associated functions in prostate cancer cells.']"""

To elucidate the surgical consequences, morbidity and mortality, and perioperative care, we conducted a nationwide survey.  Materials and methods:   Assisted by the Japanese Society of Endourology, perioperative data from 156 hospitals participating in this survey in 2007 were analyzed. Using a spreadsheet database, data were collected from each institution.  Results:   Open radical prostatectomy was performed in 3,138 patients at 143 hospitals, minimum incision endourological radical prostatectomy in 361 at 15 hospitals, laparoscopic radical prostatectomy via transperitoneal approach in 143 at 11 hospitals and laparoscopic radical prostatectomy via extraperitoneal approach in 337 at 13 hospitals. For open and minimum incision endourological radical prostatectomy, the surgical duration was shorter but the bleeding volume was greater than that in laparoscopic radical prostatectomy via both approaches. As a whole, perioperatvie mortality rate was 0.05% and morbidity rate was 23.4%. Rectal injury was similarly infrequent among the four types of surgery. Superficial surgical site infection was most frequent in open radical prostatectomy. Perioperative management significantly varied among the four types of surgery. In laparoscopic radical prostatectomy via extraperitoneal approach, urethral catheter was removed earlier but acute urinary retention frequently occurred.  Conclusions:   In Japan, open radical prostatectomy was the most frequently performed surgery for prostate cancer. Surgical volume per hospital was small, however, mortality was low and morbidity was acceptable. Comparisons of complications and outcomes among the types of currently performed surgery should be useful to promote standardization of the perioperative care.""","""['Kikuo Okamura', 'Tomoyasu Tsushima', 'Mutsushi Kawakita', 'Yoshikatsu Nojiri', 'Seiji Naito', 'Tadashi Matsuda', 'Ryohei Hattori', 'Tomonori Hasegawa', 'Yasuhiro Kaiho', 'Yoichi Arai']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Nihon Hinyokika Gakkai Zasshi""","""['Influence of hospital surgical volume of radical prostatectomy on quality of perioperative care.', 'Robot-assisted versus open radical prostatectomy: the differential effect of regionalization, procedure volume and operative approach.', 'Morbidity of laparoscopic radical prostatectomy: summary of early multi-institutional experience in Japan.', 'Laparoscopic radical prostatectomy for localized prostate cancer: a systematic review of comparative studies.', 'Robotic Surgical System for Radical Prostatectomy: A Health Technology Assessment.', 'Influence of hospital surgical volume of radical prostatectomy on quality of perioperative care.']"""

Increased activation of the AKT and NFkB pathways have been identified as critical steps in prostate cancer initiation and progression. GGAP2 (GTP-binding and GTPase activating protein 2) is a multidomain protein that contains an N-terminal Ras homology domain (GTPase), followed by a PH domain, a C-terminal GAP domain and an ankyrin repeat domain. GGAP2 can directly activate signaling via both the AKT and NFkB pathways and acts as a node of crosstalk between these pathways. Increased GGAP2 expression is present in three quarters of prostate cancers. Mutations of GGAP2 have been reported in cell lines from other malignancies. We therefore analyzed 84 prostate cancer tissues and 43 benign prostate tissues for somatic mutations in GGAP2 by direct sequencing of individual clones derived from the GAP and GTPase domains of normal and tumor tissue. Overall, half of cancers contained mutant GAP domain clones and in 20% of cancers, 30% or more of clones were mutant in the GAP domain. Surprisingly, the mutations were heterogeneous and nonclonal, with multiple different mutations being present in many tumors. Similar findings were observed in the analysis of the GTPase domain. Mutant GGAP2 proteins had significantly higher transcriptional activity using AP-1 responsive reporter constructs when compared to wild-type protein. Furthermore, the presence of these mutations was associated with aggressive clinical behavior. The presence of high frequency nonclonal mutations of a single gene is novel and represents a new mode of genetic alteration that can promote tumor progression. Analysis of mutations in cancer has been used to predict outcome and guide therapeutic target identification but such analysis has focused on clonal mutations. Our studies indicate that in some cases high frequency nonclonal mutations may need to be assessed as well.""","""['Yi Cai', 'Jianghua Wang', 'Chengxi Ren', 'Michael Ittmann']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['GGAP2/PIKE-a directly activates both the Akt and nuclear factor-kappaB pathways and promotes prostate cancer progression.', 'GGAPs, a new family of bifunctional GTP-binding and GTPase-activating proteins.', 'Cancer-Associated Point Mutations in the DLC1 Tumor Suppressor and Other Rho-GAPs Occur Frequently and Are Associated with Decreased Function.', 'Involvement of the multiple tumor suppressor genes and 12-lipoxygenase in human prostate cancer.

During metastasis, cells from a primary tumor acquire characteristics that enable them to escape from the primary tumor and migrate through the heterogeneous stromal environment to establish secondary tumors. Despite being linked to poor prognosis, there are no direct clinical tests available to diagnose the likelihood of metastasis. Moreover, the physical mechanisms employed by metastatic cancer cells to migrate are poorly understood. Because metastasis of most solid tumors requires cells to exert force to reorganize and navigate through dense stroma, we investigated differences in cellular force generation between metastatic and non-metastatic cells. Using traction force microscopy, we found that in human metastatic breast, prostate and lung cancer cell lines, traction stresses were significantly increased compared to non-metastatic counterparts. This trend was recapitulated in the isogenic MCF10AT series of breast cancer cells. Our data also indicate that increased matrix stiffness and collagen density promote increased traction forces, and that metastatic cells generate higher forces than non-metastatic cells across all matrix properties studied. Additionally, we found that cell spreading for these cell lines has a direct relationship with collagen density, but a biphasic relationship with substrate stiffness, indicating that cell area alone does not dictate the magnitude of traction stress generation. Together, these data suggest that cellular contractile force may play an important role in metastasis, and that the physical properties of the stromal environment may regulate cellular force generation. These findings are critical for understanding the physical mechanisms of metastasis and the role of the extracellular microenvironment in metastatic progression.""","""['Casey M Kraning-Rush', 'Joseph P Califano', 'Cynthia A Reinhart-King']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['The matrix environmental and cell mechanical properties regulate cell migration and contribute to the invasive phenotype of cancer cells.', 'Integrin-mediated traction force enhances paxillin molecular associations and adhesion dynamics that increase the invasiveness of tumor cells into a three-dimensional extracellular matrix.', 'COX-2 dependent regulation of mechanotransduction in human breast cancer cells.', 'Cellular traction stresses mediate extracellular matrix degradation by invadopodia.', 'Molecular insights into prostate cancer progression: the missing link of tumor microenvironment.', 'Fungus-derived protein particles as cell-adhesive matrices for cell-cultivated food.', 'Extracellular matrix composition alters endothelial force transmission.', 'High extracellular glucose promotes cell motility by modulating cell deformability and contractility via the cAMP-RhoA-ROCK axis in human breast cancer cells.', 'Elastomeric Pillar Cages Modulate Actomyosin Contractility of Epithelial Microtissues by Substrate Stiffness and Topography.', 'Cell-extracellular matrix mechanotransduction in 3D.']"""

It is composed of pure neuroendocrine (NE) tumor cells, but unlike the scattered NE cells in benign prostate and adenocarcinoma that are quiescent, the NE cells in SCNC are highly proliferative and aggressive, causing death in months. In this study, we provide evidence that interleukin 8 (IL8)-CXCR2-P53 (TP53) signaling pathway keeps the NE cells of benign prostate and adenocarcinoma in a quiescent state normally. While P53 appears to be wild-type in the NE cells of benign prostate and adenocarcinoma, immunohistochemical studies show that the majority of the NE tumor cells in SCNC are positive for nuclear p53, suggesting that the p53 is mutated. This observation is confirmed by sequencing of genomic DNA showing p53 mutation in five of seven cases of SCNC. Our results support the hypothesis that p53 mutation leads to inactivation of the IL8-CXCR2-p53 signaling pathway, resulting in the loss of an important growth inhibitory mechanism and the hyper-proliferation of NE cells in SCNC. Therefore, we have identified potential cells of origin and a molecular target for prostatic SCNC that are very different from those of conventional adenocarcinoma, which explains SCNC's distinct biology and the clinical observation that it does not respond to hormonal therapy targeting androgen receptor signaling, which produces short-term therapeutic effects in nearly all patients with prostatic adenocarcinoma.""","""['Hongbing Chen', 'Yin Sun', 'Chengyu Wu', 'Clara E Magyar', 'Xinmin Li', 'Liang Cheng', 'Jorge L Yao', 'Steven Shen', 'Adeboye O Osunkoya', 'Chaozhao Liang', 'Jiaoti Huang']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Endocr Relat Cancer""","""['p53 Mutation Directs AURKA Overexpression via miR-25 and FBXW7 in Prostatic Small Cell Neuroendocrine Carcinoma.', 'Androgen-deprivation therapy-induced aggressive prostate cancer with neuroendocrine differentiation.', 'PC3 is a cell line characteristic of prostatic small cell carcinoma.', 'Neuroendocrine differentiation in usual-type prostatic adenocarcinoma: Molecular characterization and clinical significance.', 'Neuroendocrine pathogenesis in adenocarcinoma of the prostate.', 'Small-Cell Carcinoma of the Prostate - Challenges of Diagnosis and Treatment: A Next of Kin and Physician Perspective Piece.', 'The Neuropilin-1/PKC axis promotes neuroendocrine differentiation and drug resistance of prostate cancer.', 'Targeting phase separation on enhancers induced by transcription factor complex formations as a new strategy for treating drug-resistant cancers.', 'Aggressive variants of prostate cancer: underlying mechanisms of neuroendocrine transdifferentiation.', 'The Crosstalk of Long Non-Coding RNA and MicroRNA in Castration-Resistant and Neuroendocrine Prostate Cancer: Their Interaction and Clinical Importance.']"""

G9a function was locus-dependent. Whereas depletion of G9a reduced expression of many Runx2 target genes, including MMP9, CSF2, SDF1, and CST7, expression of others, such as MMP13 and PIP, was enhanced. Physical association between G9a and Runx2 was indicated by co-immunoprecipitation, GST-pulldown, immunofluorescence, and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) assays. Since G9a makes repressive histone methylation marks and is primarily known as a corepressor, we further investigated the mechanism by which G9a functioned as a positive regulator for Runx2 target genes. Transient reporter assays indicated that the histone methyltransferase activity of G9a was not required for transcriptional activation by Runx2. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays for Runx2 and G9a showed that G9a was recruited to endogenous Runx2 binding sites.

Recently, there has been interest in examining the effects of whole extracts from commonly harvested crops on the behaviour and progression of cancer. Here, we describe the effects of whole cranberry extract (WCE) on the behaviour of DU145 human prostate cancer cells in vitro. Following treatment of DU145 human prostate cancer cells with 10, 25 and 50 μg ml⁻¹ of WCE, respectively for 6 h, WCE significantly decreased the cellular viability of DU145 cells. WCE also decreased the proportion of cells in the G2-M phase of the cell cycle and increased the proportion of cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle following treatment of cells with 25 and 50 μg ml⁻¹ treatment of WCE for 6 h. These alterations in cell cycle were associated with changes in cell cycle regulatory proteins and other cell cycle associated proteins. WCE decreased the expression of CDK4, cyclin A, cyclin B1, cyclin D1 and cyclin E, and increased the expression of p27. Changes in p16(INK4a) and pRBp107 protein expression levels also were evident, however, the changes noted in p16(INK4a) and pRBp107 protein expression levels were not statistically significant.

However, the effect of PAB on DU145 cells, an in vitro model of hormone-refractory prostate cancer (HRPC), has not been reported previously. In the study, PAB significantly suppressed proliferation of DU145 cells in a dose-dependent manner without obvious cytotoxicity. IC(50) values of 0.89 ± 0.18 and 0.76 ± 0.15 μM at 48h was determined by Cell counting kit (CCK-8) assay and clone formation assay, respectively. PAB also induced DU145 cells apoptosis as confirmed by typical morphological changes and Annexin V-FITC staining. Furthermore, we demonstrated that PAB caused a concentration-dependent elevation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) level in DU145 cells, and N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC, a well-known ROS scavenger) could block PAB-induced ROS generation and apoptosis. Western blotting and/or caspase activity data indicated that PAB downregulated anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein and activated caspase-9 and caspase-3, which were largely rescued by NAC or MG-132 (proteasome inhibitor). Taken together, these findings provide the first evidence that PAB may inhibit growth of HRPC DU145 cells and induce apoptosis through ROS generation and Bcl-2 degradation via the activation of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.""","""['Dandan Zhao', 'Feng Lin', 'Xingde Wu', 'Qinshi Zhao', 'Binjiahui Zhao', 'Ping Lin', 'Yanlong Zhang', 'Xiaoguang Yu']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Toxicol In Vitro""","""['Barakol-induced apoptosis in P19 cells through generation of reactive oxygen species and activation of caspase-9.', 'Tanshinone IIA reduces apoptosis induced by hydrogen peroxide in the human endothelium-derived EA.hy926 cells.', 'Pseudolaric acid B induces caspase-dependent cell death in human ovarian cancer cells.', 'Chinese herb related molecules of cancer-cell-apoptosis: a minireview of progress between Kanglaite injection and related genes.', 'A Systematic Review of the Immune-Regulating and Anticancer Activities of Pseudolaric Acid B.', 'Molecular Basis of Prostate Cancer and Natural Products as Potential Chemotherapeutic and Chemopreventive Agents.', 'Pseudolaric Acid B Inhibits Proliferation, Invasion, and Angiogenesis in Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma Through Regulating CD147.', 'Early Intracellular Trafficking and Subsequent Activity of Programmed Cell Death in Channel Catfish Macrophages Infected with Edwardsiella ictaluri.', 'Pseudolaric Acid B Induces Growth Inhibition and Caspase-Dependent Apoptosis on Head and Neck Cancer Cell lines through Death Receptor 5.', 'Pseudolaric acid B inhibits PAX2 expression through Wnt signaling and induces BAX expression, therefore promoting apoptosis in HeLa cervical cancer cells.']"""

However, it is not known how the incidence trends for specific locations of metastasis vary. Site-specific data are available on the basis of the ninth international classification of diseases. CUP patients were identified between 1987 and 2008 from the Swedish Family-Cancer Database. Malignant neoplasms of ill-defined sites were diagnosed in 4042 patients, 1976 developed metastasis in lymph nodes, 9615 had metastasis in specified organs, and in 8052 patients, the malignant neoplasm was diagnosed without further specification. Age-standardized incidence rates for 23 685 patients were analyzed using a direct method of standardization. Overall, the incidence of CUP decreased from 6.98 to 6.00 per 100 000 from 1987 to 2008. The number of patients diagnosed with metastasis in specified organs decreased, whereas the number of patients diagnosed with CUP without further specification increased from 2.65 to 3.02 per 100 000. With improvements in diagnostic methods and imaging techniques for identification of cancer, the incidences of CUP have been decreasing because primary tumors can be specified more often. Computed tomography is typically sensitive in detecting lung, kidney, and colorectal cancers, which are known to have a genetic link with CUP. Prostate-specific antigen testing is used to detect prostate cancer, for which bone is a common metastatic site. Liver metastases are common if the primary tumor is located in the colorectum. If the primary tumor is found, this cancer site replaces the diagnosis of CUP within the Cancer Register and therefore CUP incidence is decreased.""","""['Melanie Bevier', 'Jan Sundquist', 'Kari Hemminki']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Eur J Cancer Prev""","""['Cancer patients without a known primary: incidence and survival trends in Sweden 1960-2007.', 'Time trends in incidence, causes of death, and survival of cancer of unknown primary in Sweden.', 'Descriptive epidemiology of cancer of unknown primary site in Scotland, 1961-2010.', 'Skin disease and malignancy.

However, the management of CRPC remains an important challenge in oncology. There have been many reports on the effects of rapamycin, which is an inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), in the treatment of carcinogenesis. We assessed the cytotoxic effects of the combination treatment of docetaxel and rapamycin in prostate cancer cells. Furthermore, we examined the relationship between these treatments and survivin, which is a member of the inhibitory apoptosis family.  Methods:   Prostate cancer cells were cultured and treated with docetaxel and rapamycin. The effects on proliferation were evaluated with the MTS assay. In addition, we evaluated the effect on proliferation of the combination treatment induced knockdown of survivin expression by small interfering RNA transfection and docetaxel. Protein expression levels were assayed using western blotting. PC3 cells and xenograft growth in nude mice were used to evaluate the in vivo efficacy of docetaxel and its combination with rapamycin.  Results:   In vitro and in vivo, the combination of rapamycin with docetaxel resulted in a greater inhibition of proliferation than treatment with rapamycin or docetaxel alone. In addition, in vitro and in vivo, rapamycin decreased basal surviving levels, and cotreatment with docetaxel further decreased these levels. Transfection siRNA against survivin enhanced the cytotoxicity of docetaxel in PC3 cells.  Conclusion:   The rapamycin-dependent enhancement of the cytotoxic effects of docetaxel was associated with the downregulation of survivin expression.

Therefore, the inhibition of CK2 is a promising therapeutic strategy to fight this disease.  Methods:   We screened a library of synthetic molecules concerning their capacity to inhibit CK2. The activity of CK2 and their IC50 and Ki values were determined by a capillary electrophoresis assay. The effects of the inhibitor in a cell culture model were analyzed by cell counting, a viability assay, cytofluorimetry and Western blot.  Results:   The best CK2 inhibitor found in this screen was 6,7-dichloro-1,4-dihydro-8-hydroxy-4-[(4-methylphenylamino)methylen]dibenzo [b,d]furan-3(2H)-one, which we refer to as ""TF"". TF showed tight binding to CK2 with low IC50 (29 nM) and Ki (15 nM) values. TF inhibited only seven out of 61 human kinases tested (>70% inhibition). Incubation of LNCaP cells with 50 μM TF for 48 h decreased the intracellular CK2 activity by 50%, confirming that the inhibitor is membrane permeable. The decrease in activity was correlated with a severe reduction in cell viability. The reduction in cell viability is at least partly due to the induction of apoptosis.

Since 1990, efforts have been ongoing to implement prospective documentation of all oncologic cases in our department accompanied by a special aftercare program ensuring regular visits and reliable data acquisition.  Materials and methods:   Our prospective database comprises a total of 6,567 cases covering all types of urologic malignancies: prostate (40.7%), renal (30.5%), urothelial (21.8%), testicular (5.8%), penile (0.8%), and other (0.4%). A specialized full-time documentalist supported by 3 student assistants entered 38,135 aftercare visits characterized by approximately 100 partly disease-specific items. The Institute of Pathology's general collection contains more than 6 million paraffin-embedded samples, and since 2005 the interdisciplinary Tissue Bank at the National Center for Tumor Diseases in Heidelberg has collected about 21,000 cryo-samples. Furthermore, we asked the opinion of 158 patients who attended our clinic for cancer surgery using a self-designed questionnaire.  Results:   Of 158 patients asked to be included in the biobank, from 09/07 through 02/08, none refused. Their additional questionnaire had a return rate of 81% (n = 128). Moral obligation for supporting medical research was realized by 95%, and circumstantial pressure to participate was not a relevant factor for 87%. Whereas only 68% were hoping for personal benefit, altruism seemed to be a much stronger motive: 96% believe others could be healed because of further medical progress; 93% wanted to be actively informed about recommended aftercare visits. Consequently, response rates in the ""Heidelberg Cancer Maintenance Program"" are constantly above 93%. Regarding research, a total of 144 scientific inquiries have been answered using our database since 1995. Within the last 5 years, 37 manuscripts originated from biobank data: herein, molecular markers and risk factors have been correlated with clinical outcome.

Results:   Fifty-five of 61 eligible patients completed the trial with radical prostatectomy after neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). The median preoperative prostate-specific antigen value was 19.8 ng/mL, and 67% of patients had a Gleason score of ≥ 7. Among 41 patients last known to be alive, median follow-up is 10.6 years (range 5.1-12.6). In all, 38 patients have had disease progression (30/55, 55%) or died without progression (8/55, 15%) for a 10-year progression-free survival (PFS) estimate of 40% (95% CI 27-53). Median PFS was 7.5 years, and median survival has not been reached. The 10-year overall survival (OS) estimate is 68% (95% CI 56-80).  Conclusions:   In this small, prospective phase II study, neoadjuvant hormonal therapy with goserelin acetate and flutamide followed by radical prostatectomy achieves long-term PFS and OS comparable with alternative treatments. This approach is feasible and may be an alternative to a strategy of combined radiation and ADT.""","""['Ryan K Berglund', 'Catherine M Tangen', 'Isaac J Powell', 'Bruce A Lowe', 'Gabriel P Haas', 'Peter R Carroll', 'Edith D Canby-Hagino', 'Ralph deVere White', 'George P Hemstreet rd', 'E David Crawford', 'Ian M Thompson Jr', 'Eric A Klein']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Urology""","""['Neoadjuvant therapy before radical prostatectomy for clinical T3/T4 carcinoma of the prostate: 5-year followup, Phase II Southwest Oncology Group Study 9109.', 'Short-term neoadjuvant androgen deprivation and radiotherapy for locally advanced prostate cancer: 10-year data from the TROG 96.01 randomised trial.', 'Preliminary results of a prospective randomized study comparing radical prostatectomy versus radical prostatectomy associated with neoadjuvant hormonal combination therapy in T2-3 N0 M0 prostatic carcinoma.

Methods:   We performed a prospective study of 133 consecutive patients who underwent robot-assisted radical prostatectomy in January and February of 2011. The surgeon graded the amount of NS intraoperatively independently for either side as follows: 1, no NS; 2, <50% NS; 3, 50% NS; 4, 75% NS; and 5, ≥ 95% NS. A pathologist who was unaware of the surgeon's score measured the area of residual nerve tissue on the posterolateral surface of the prostate.  Results:   A greater NS score correlated significantly with a decreasing area of residual nerve tissue on the prostatectomy specimens (P < .001). Overall, the area of residual nerve tissue on the prostatectomy specimens was significantly different among the NS groups (P < .001). On specific intergroup analysis, significant differences were found in the area of residual nerve tissue on the prostatectomy specimens between the greater NS groups: NS score 3 versus 4, median 13 mm(2) (interquartile range [IQR] 7-23) versus 3 mm(2) (IQR 0-8; P = .01); NS score 4 versus 5, median 3 mm(2) (IQR 0-8) versus 0.5 mm(2) (IQR 0-2; P = .001).  Conclusion:   Subjective NS classification using the surgeon's intraoperative perception correlated significantly with the area of residual nerve tissue on the prostatectomy specimens determined by the pathologist. It is possible to intentionally tailor the amount of NS performed at surgery. This finding demonstrates that NS is a graded rather than an all-or-none phenomenon that can even go beyond the traditional concept of complete, partial, or no NS.""","""['Oscar Schatloff', 'Sanket Chauhan', 'Darian Kameh', 'Rair Valero', 'Young H Ko', 'Ananthakrishnan Sivaraman', 'Rafael F Coelho', 'Jeff Marquinez', 'Kenneth J Palmer', 'Vipul R Patel']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Urology""","""['Current status of various neurovascular bundle-sparing techniques in robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Pathological confirmation of nerve-sparing types performed during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP).', 'Anatomic grading of nerve sparing during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Stepwise approach for nerve sparing without countertraction during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: technique and outcomes.', 'Nerve-sparing techniques in open and laparoscopic prostatectomy.', 'Nerve-sparing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: Current perspectives.', 'Climacturia After Radical Prostatectomy: MRI-Based Predictors.', 'Lessons learned from 12,000 robotic radical prostatectomies: Is the journey as important as the outcome?', 'Current status of various neurovascular bundle-sparing techniques in robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Newer concepts in neural anatomy and neurovascular preservation in robotic radical prostatectomy.']"""

The Briganti nomogram predicts the probability of LNI in patients undergoing extended pelvic lymph node dissection (EPLND) during radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer.  Methods:   Irrespective of the risk of LNI, 173 consecutive patients were treated for localized prostate cancer with radical laparoscopic prostatectomy and EPLND. The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve was used to estimate the predictive accuracy of the nomograms, and calibration plots were used for comparisons between the predicted and observed probabilities of LNI.  Results:   The median number of nodes removed was 15 (range 10-34). Of the 173 patients, 12 (6.9%) had LNI. The Briganti nomogram achieved a receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.88 versus 0.83 with the Cagiannos nomogram and 0.84 with the 2007 Partin tables. The difference in predictive accuracy was not statistically significant (P < .2). The Briganti nomogram showed only minor departures from the ideal predictions in the low-risk range and the Cagiannos nomogram showed major departures from the ideal predictions for the entire risk range.  Conclusion:   The Briganti nomogram provides highly accurate predictions of the risk of LNI after EPLND. Its performance tended to be increased without being significantly better.

Data on incidence of fractures and risks in subgroups of men with prostate cancer are sparse. Our aim with this study is to report the risk of fractures among men with prostate cancer in a nationwide population-based study.  Patients and methods:   We identified 76,600 Swedish men diagnosed with prostate cancer 1997-2006 in the Prostate Cancer Data Base (PCBaSe) Sweden and compared the occurrence of fractures requiring hospitalisation with the Swedish male population.  Results:   Only men treated with gonadotropin releasing-hormone (GnRH) agonists or orchiectomy had increased incidence and increased relative risk of fractures requiring hospitalisation. Men treated with GnRH agonists had 9.8 and 6.3/1000 person-years higher incidence of any fracture and hip fracture requiring hospitalisation than the general population. The corresponding increases in incidence for men treated with orchiectomy were 16 and 12/1000 person-years, respectively. Men treated with orchiectomy, GnRH agonists, and antiandrogen monotherapy, had SIR for hip fracture of 2.0 (95% Confidence Interval 1.8-2.2), 1.6 (95% CI 1.5-1.8) and 0.9 (95% CI 0.7-1.1), respectively. Men treated with a curative intent (radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy) or managed with surveillance had no increased risk of fractures. Older men had the highest incidence of fractures while younger men had the highest relative risk.  Conclusion:   Prostate cancer patients treated with GnRH agonists or orchiectomy have significantly increased risk of fractures requiring hospitalisation while patients treated with antiandrogen monotherapy had no increase in such fractures. In absolute terms the excess risk in men treated with GnRH agonists corresponded to almost 10 extra fractures leading to hospitalisation per 1000 patient-years.

Purpose:   BMS-247550 (ixabepilone) is an epothilone B analogue with activity in taxane-resistant cancer cell lines. Here we report the activity and toxicity of ixabepilone, administered by using a weekly schedule, in men with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).  Experimental design:   Patients with metastatic CRPC received ixabepilone at 20 mg/m(2) intravenous weekly x 3, in 4-week cycles. This noncomparative study stratified patients to either a chemotherapy naive (CN), prior taxane (Tax) only, or 2 prior cytotoxic (TCx) chemotherapy arm. The primary endpoint was prostate-specific antigen response by using PCWG (Prostate Cancer Working Group) 1 criteria.

Studies have suggested familial concordance in survival, but the extent to which that is due to tumor characteristics is not known.  Objective:   We hypothesized that a brother of an index case with prostate cancer is at particularly increased risk of prostate cancer with the same tumor differentiation as the index case.  Design, setting and participants:   We identified 21,930 brothers of index cases with prostate cancer in the Prostate Cancer Data Base Sweden and followed them up for incidence of prostate cancer.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The relative risk of Gleason score-specific prostate cancer in the cohort of brothers was estimated by using the standardized incidence ratio (SIR) stratified by Gleason score of the index case. We estimated 95% confidence intervals (CIs) assuming a Poisson distribution.  Results and limitations:   Among brothers of index cases with Gleason score 8-10 cancer, the SIR was 2.53 (95% CI, 1.97-3.21) for a Gleason score 2-6 cancer and 4.00 (95% CI, 2.63-5.82) for a Gleason score 8-10 cancer. SIR for Gleason score 2-6 cancer among brothers decreased with time since the date of the index cases' diagnoses, whereas the risk of Gleason 8-10 cancer increased over time for brothers of index cases with Gleason 8-10 cancer (p for trend = 0.009).  Conclusions:   Brothers of men with high-grade prostate cancer are at particularly increased risk of high-grade prostate cancer. Likewise, there is a concordance of less malignant prostate cancers within families.

Patients and methods:   In a cohort of 304 patients with advanced prostate cancer undergoing ADT, we genotyped 746 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 72 genes from germline DNA (680 tagSNPs from 58 genes and 66 candidate SNPs from 20 genes [6 genes common in both]). Association with the primary end point of time to ADT failure was assessed using proportional hazards regression models at the gene level (for genes with tagging SNPs) and at the SNP level. False discovery rates (FDRs) of 0.10 or less were considered noteworthy to account for multiple testing.  Results:   At the gene level, TRMT11 showed the strongest association with time to ADT failure (P<.001; FDR=0.008). Two of 4 TRMT11 tagSNPs were associated with time to ADT failure. Median time to ADT failure for rs1268121 (A>G) was 3.05 years for the AA, 4.27 years for the AG, and 6.22 years for the GG genotypes (P=.002), and for rs6900796 (G>A), it was 2.42 years for the GG, 3.52 years for the AG, and 4.18 years for the AA genotypes (P<.001).

However, how cellular PSA level is associated with sensitivity of PCa to radiotherapy is unknown. The previous finding that the RelB-based NF-κB alternative pathway differentially regulates PSA and interleukin-8 (IL-8) in aggressive PCa has directed our attention to the role of RelB in the response of PCa to radiotherapy.  Methodology/principal findings:   RelB and its targets PSA and IL-8 in PCa cells were manipulated by ectopic expression in PCa cells with a low endogenous level of RelB (LNCaP) and by RNAi-based knock-down in PCa cells with a high constitutive level of RelB (PC3). The effects of RelB, PSA and IL-8 on the response of PCa to radiation treatment were examined in vitro and in xenograft tumors. RelB regulates PSA and IL-8 in an inverse manner. When the cellular levels of PSA and IL-8 were directly modulated by genetic manipulations or by the addition of recombinant proteins, the results demonstrate that up-regulation of IL-8 enhanced radioresistance of PCa cells and concurrently down-regulated PSA. In contrast, up-regulation of PSA resulted in reduced radioresistance with concurrent down-regulation of IL-8.  Conclusion/significance:   RelB plays a critical role in the response of PCa to radiotherapy and the inverse expression of IL-8 and PSA. The results identify a previously unrecognized relationship between IL-8 and PSA in the response of PCa cells to radiotherapy.""","""['Yong Xu', 'Fang Fang', 'Daret K St Clair', 'William H St Clair']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['HZ08 suppresses RelB-activated MnSOD expression and enhances Radiosensitivity of prostate Cancer cells.', 'RelB enhances prostate cancer growth: implications for the role of the nuclear factor-kappaB alternative pathway in tumorigenicity.', 'RelB upregulates PD-L1 and exacerbates prostate cancer immune evasion.', 'RelB-dependent differential radiosensitization effect of STI571 on prostate cancer cells.', 'RelB regulates manganese superoxide dismutase gene and resistance to ionizing radiation of prostate cancer cells.', 'IL-27/IL-27RA signaling may modulate inflammation and progression of benign prostatic hyperplasia via suppressing the LPS/TLR4 pathway.', 'Radioresistance in Prostate Cancer: Focus on the Interplay between NF-κB and SOD.', 'Angiotensin 1-7 modulates molecular and cellular processes central to the pathogenesis of prostate cancer.', 'HZ08 suppresses RelB-activated MnSOD expression and enhances Radiosensitivity of prostate Cancer cells.', 'DNA Repair and Cytokines: TGF-β, IL-6, and Thrombopoietin as Different Biomarkers of Radioresistance.']"""

Instead, AR induced p21, which subsequently reduced ΔN isoform of p63. Second, AR activation increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) and thereby suppressed Rb phosphorylation. Both pathways were critical for senescence as was proven by p21 and Rb knock-down and by quenching ROS with N-Acetyl cysteine and p63 silencing also mimicked AR-induced senescence. The two pathways engaged in a cross-talk, likely via PML tumor suppressor, whose localization to senescence-associated chromatin foci was increased by AR activation. All these pathways contributed to growth arrest, which resolved in senescence due to concomitant lack of p53 and high mTOR activity.

Here, we show the predominant estrogen receptor (ER) isoform expressed in PCa specimens and cell lines is ERβ. Our data indicate that E2 induces the formation of a complex between androgen receptor (AR), ERβ, and a proline-, glutamic acid-, and leucine-rich cofactor protein 1 (PELP1) in PCa cells. This protein complex is formed on AR's cognate DNA-responsive elements on the promoter in response to E2. Formation of this complex enables the transcription of AR-responsive genes in response to E2. Knockdown of PELP1, AR, or ERβ blocks the assembly of this complex, blocks E2-induced genomic activation of AR-regulated genes, and blocks E2-stimulated proliferation of PCa cells. Overall, this study shows that PELP1 may enable E2-induced AR signaling by forming a protein complex between AR, ERβ, and PELP1 on the DNA, leading to the proliferation of PCa cells in the absence of androgen. PELP1 may bridge the signal between E2 bound to ERβ and AR and thus allow for cross talk between these steroid receptors. These data suggest a novel mechanism of AR activation in the absence of androgens in PCa cells.

Methods:   This retrospective study was conducted in patients who were being followed up after EBRT for histological proven prostate cancer. We selected the patients with a local recurrence by [11C]choline PET/CT fusion. The results of PET were compared with the results of histology and with clinical follow-up.  Results:   Forty-two patients with a local recurrence suggested by PET were included in this study. According to PET results: of the 42 patients, 15 (36%) had a focal recurrence, 27 (64%) showed a diffuse recurrence. The overall concordance of PET with histology concerning detection of recurrence was 76% (32 patients had positive PET results and positive biopsies). We confirmed the local recurrence as visualized by PET in 37/42 (88%) patients using a composite reference with histology and clinical follow up after local salvage treatment. The concordance of the intraprostatic distribution of the tumor with PET with histology from transrectal prostate biopsies (median biopsies 7, range 4-12) was 47% (7/15) in unilateral cases and 41% (11/27) in bilateral cases.

VMAT relies on precise combinations of dose rate, gantry speed, and multileaf collimator (MLC) shapes to deliver intensity-modulated patterns. Such complexity warrants the development of correspondingly robust performance verification systems. In this work, we report on a remote, automated software system for daily delivery verification of VMAT treatments. The performance verification software system consists of three main components: (1) a query module for retrieving daily MLC, gantry, and jaw positions reported by the linear accelerator control system to the record and verify system; (2) an analysis module which reads the daily delivery report generated from the database query module, compares the reported treatment positions against the planned positions, and compiles delivery position error reports; and (3) a graphical reporting module which displays reports initiated by a user anywhere within the institutional network or which can be configured to alert authorized users when predefined tolerance values are exceeded. The utility of the system was investigated through analysis of patient data collected at our clinic. Nearly 2500 VMAT fractions have been analyzed with the delivery verification system at our institution. The average percentage of reported MLC leaf positions within 3 mm, gantry positions within 2°, and jaw positions within 3 mm of their planned positions was 92.9% ± 5.5%, 95.9%± 2.9%, and 99.7% ± 0.6%, respectively. The level of agreement between planned and reported MLC positions decreased for treatment plans requiring larger MLC leaf movements between control points. Differences in the reported MLC position error between the delivery verification system and data extracted manually from the control system were noted; however, the differences are likely systematic and, therefore, may be characterized if appropriately accounted for. Further investigation is needed to confirm the utility and accuracy of the system.""","""['Jonas D Fontenot']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""J Appl Clin Med Phys""","""['A method to reconstruct and apply 3D primary fluence for treatment delivery verification.', 'Quality assurance of non-coplanar, volumetric-modulated arc therapy employing a C-arm linear accelerator, featuring continuous patient couch rotation.', 'An EPID-based system for gantry-resolved MLC quality assurance for VMAT.', 'A novel method for routine quality assurance of volumetric-modulated arc therapy.', 'Securing the information system of health care organisations.', 'A method to reconstruct and apply 3D primary fluence for treatment delivery verification.', 'A software tool to automatically assure and report daily treatment deliveries by a cobalt-60 radiation therapy device.']"""

Methods:   This report includes 963 newly diagnosed cases of histologically confirmed prostate cancer and 941 randomly selected age-matched controls ascertained from the population-based Prostate Cancer in a Black Population study conducted between July 2002 and January 2011 in Barbados, West Indies. Trained nurse interviewers obtained data on height, weight, waist and hip circumferences, family and medical history, and lifestyle factors. ORs and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used to assess associations between anthropometric measures and prostate cancer.  Results:   A two-fold increased risk of prostate cancer was found among men in the highest quartile of waist-hip ratio compared with those in the lowest quartile (OR = 2.11, 95% CI, 1.54-2.88). Similarly, men with the largest waist circumferences had an OR of 1.84 (95% CI, 1.19-2.85) compared with those with the smallest waist sizes.  Conclusions:   These results suggest that measures of central rather than global adiposity may be more predictive of prostate cancer, especially in westernized African populations, where patterns of visceral fat distribution are different than other groups.

Early diagnosis increases survival rate in patients; however, treatments for advanced disease are limited to hormone ablation techniques and palliative care. Thus, new methods of treatment are necessary for inhibiting prostate cancer disease progression. Here, we have shown that miRNA-29b (miR-29b) expression was lower in prostate cancer cells (PC3 and LNCaP) as compared with immortalized prostate epithelial cells. Between these two prostate cancer cell lines, metastatic prostate cancer PC3 cells displayed lower expression of miR-29b. We also observed a significant downregulation of miR-29b expression in human prostate cancer tissues as compared with patient-matched nontumor tissues. PC3 cells ectopically expressing miR-29b inhibited wound healing, invasiveness, and failed to colonize in the lungs and liver of severe combined immunodeficient mice after intravenous injection, while PC3 cells expressing a control miRNA displayed metastasis. Epithelial cell marker E-cadherin expression was enhanced miR-29b transfected in prostate cancer cells as compared with cells expressing control miRNA. On the other hand, N-cadherin, Twist, and Snail expression was downregulated in PC3 cells expressing miR-29b. Together these results suggested that miR-29b acts as an antimetastatic miRNA for prostate cancer cells at multiple steps in a metastatic cascade.

Methods and materials:   A Feldkamp-David-Kress-based CBTS reconstruction was applied to selected sets of cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) projection data to simulate volumetric imaging achievable from tomosynthesis for a limited range of scan angles. Projection data were calculated from planning CT images of 10 prostate cancer patients treated with an endorectal balloon, as were experimental CBCT projections for a pelvic phantom in two patients. More than 50 points at the air-tissue interface were objectively identified by an intensity-based interface-finding algorithm. Using three-dimensional point sets extracted from CBTS images compared with points extracted from corresponding CBCT images, the relative shift resulting from a reduced scan angle was determined. Because the CBCT and CBTS images were generated from the same projection data set, shift identified was presumed to be due to distortions introduced by the tomosynthesis technique.  Results:   Scans of ≥60° were shown to be able to localize an air-tissue interface near the isocenter with accuracy on the order of a millimeter. The accuracy was quantified in terms of the mean discrepancy as a function of reconstruction angle.  Conclusion:   This work provides an understanding of the effect of scan angle used in localization of a portion of an endorectal balloon by means of CBTS. CBTS with relatively small scan angles is capable of accurately localizing an extended interface near the isocenter and may provide clinically relevant measurements to guide IGRT treatments while reducing imaging radiation to the patient.""","""['Sook Kien Ng', 'Piotr Zygmanski', 'Yulia Lyatskaya', ""Anthony V D'Amico"", 'Robert A Cormack']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Development and clinical evaluation of a three-dimensional cone-beam computed tomography estimation method using a deformation field map.', 'Evaluation and Clinical Application of a Commercially Available Iterative Reconstruction Algorithm for CBCT-Based IGRT.', 'Characterization of a prototype rapid kilovoltage x-ray image guidance system designed for a ring shape radiation therapy unit.', 'Comparison of image-guided radiotherapy technologies for prostate cancer.', 'Image guided radiation therapy for prostate cancer; how, when and why?.', 'Impact of androgen-deprivation therapy on the outcome of dose-escalation prostate cancer radiotherapy without elective pelvic irradiation.', 'Reliability of semiquantitative assessment of osteophytes and subchondral cysts on tomosynthesis images by radiologists with different levels of expertise.']"""

However, intrafraction motion may compromise the delivered target dose distribution. Dynamic multileaf collimator (DMLC) tracking can potentially mitigate the impact of target motion on the dose. The purpose of this study was to use a single kV imager for DMLC tracking during IMAT and to investigate the ability of this tracking to maintain the dose distribution.  Methods:   A motion phantom carrying a two-dimensional (2D) ion chamber array and buildup material with an embedded gold marker reproduced eight representative tumor trajectories (four lung tumors, four prostate). For each trajectory, a low and high IMAT plan were delivered with and without DMLC tracking. The three-dimensional (3D) real-time target position signal for tracking was provided by fluoroscopic kV images acquired immediately before and during treatment. For each image, the 3D position of the embedded marker was estimated from the imaged 2D position by a probability-based method. The MLC leaves were continuously refitted to the estimated 3D position. For lung, prediction was used to compensate for the tracking latency. The delivered 2D dose distributions were measured with the ion chamber array and compared with a reference dose distribution delivered without target motion using a 3%/3 mm γ-test.  Results:   For lung tumor motion, tracking reduced the mean γ-failure rate from 38% to 0.7% for low-modulation IMAT plans and from 44% to 2.8% for high-modulation plans. For prostate, the γ-failure rate reduction was from 19% to 0% (low modulation) and from 20% to 2.7% (high modulation). The dominant contributor to the residual γ-failures during tracking was target localization errors for most lung cases and leaf fitting errors for most prostate cases.  Conclusion:   Image-based tracking for IMAT was demonstrated for the first time.

Methods and materials:   Fifteen physicians from different Institutes drew the PB on CT images of 10 patients. The spread of DICE values was used to objectively select those observers who significantly disagreed with the others.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided biopsy demonstrates high prostate cancer detection rates in these patients if functional MRI is suspicious for prostate cancer. However, MRI-guided biopsy is not commonly available and features considerable technical requirements. This was a pilot study to investigate if a standard repeat TRUS-GB, with additional targeted cores to suspicious lesions on functional MRI, can achieve similar detection rates as compared to MRI-guided biopsy.  Patients and methods:   3 Tesla functional MRI was performed in 58 patients with ≥1 previous negative biopsy, persistently increased PSA ≥4 ng/ml and unsuspicious digital rectal examination. Suspicious lesions were marked on a localization map to enable their finding on TRUS. Random TRUS-GB with additional targeted cores according to the functional MRI findings were performed in patients with ≥1 suspicious lesion.  Results:   In 37.9% (22/58), functional MRI demonstrated suspicious findings. Out of these 22 patients, 16 underwent TRUS-GB with additional targeted cores. Prostate cancer was diagnosed in 68.8% (11/16). Eight out of these 11 patients subsequently underwent radical prostatectomy and all tumors fulfilled criteria for high-risk prostate cancer. With a median follow-up of 49.1 weeks neither significant PSA increase nor prostate cancer was detected in patients with normal functional MRI findings.  Conclusion:   Our approach enables excellent detection rates of clinically significant prostate cancer in patients with ≥1 previous negative biopsy and persistently increased PSA levels. Due to the current disadvantages of MRI-guided biopsy, our approach therefore represents an excellent alternative to MRI-guided biopsy.""","""['Christian Arsov', 'Michael Quentin', 'Robert Rabenalt', 'Gerald Antoch', 'Peter Albers', 'Dirk Blondin']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Anticancer Res""","""['MRI-guided biopsy of the prostate increases diagnostic performance in men with elevated or increasing PSA levels after previous negative TRUS biopsies.', 'Direct comparison of targeted MRI-guided biopsy with systematic transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy in patients with previous negative prostate biopsies.', 'Critical evaluation of magnetic resonance imaging targeted, transrectal ultrasound guided transperineal fusion biopsy for detection of prostate cancer.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'MRI for troubleshooting detection of prostate cancer.', 'Which Prostate Cancers are Undetected by Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Men with Previous Prostate Biopsy?

Therefore, we compared biweekly to triweekly docetaxel as first- or second-line chemotherapy for advanced HRPC in this prospective randomized multicenter trial.  Patients and methods:   In this study, 360 patients were randomly allocated to receive docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) i.v. d1 q3 weeks (tT) or 50 mg/m(2) i.v. d1 and d 14, q4 weeks (bT) from March 2004 to May 2009. Oral prednisolone (10 mg/day) was administered in both groups. The groups were well balanced according to the WHO performance status in terms of mean age (70 vs. 68, range 45-87 years) and median serum PSA level at the time of study entry (109 vs. 98 μg/l, range 11-1490 μg/l).

Complication rate and clinical outcome were examined.  Results:   Mean patient age was 69.2 (63-81) years. Primary therapy was radical prostatectomy, radiation therapy, or pelvic LND and androgen deprivation in 3, 2 and 1 cases, respectively.

There were no significant effects by genistein intervention on proliferation-, cell cycle-, apoptosis- or neuroendocrine biomarkers. Genistein intervention, however, significantly reduced the mRNA level of KLK4 in tumour cells (P = 0·033) and there was a non-significant reduction in androgen and cell cycle-related biomarkers, except for p27Kip1, whose expression in the nuclear compartment was increased. Genistein intervention modulated the expression of several biomarkers which may be related to PCa prediction and progression. The present study supports genistein as a chemopreventive agent in PCa.

We evaluated the use of the barbed suture for urethrovesical anastomosis (UVA) during robotic assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP). Time to completion of UVA, post-operative anastomotic leak rate, and urinary incontinence were compared in patients undergoing UVA with 3-0 unidirectional-barbed suture vs. 3-0 Monocryl™ (Ethicon, Somerville, NJ).  Materials and methods:   Data were prospectively collected for 70 consecutive patients undergoing RALP for prostate cancer between November 2009 and October 2010. In the first 35 patients, the UVA was performed using a modified running van Velthoven anastomosis technique using two separate 3-0 monofilament sutures. In the subsequent 35 patients, the UVA was performed using two running novel unidirectional barbed sutures. At 7-12 days postoperatively, all patients were evaluated with a cystogram to determine anastomotic integrity. Urinary incontinence was assessed at two months and five months by total daily pad usage. Clinical symptoms suggestive of bladder neck contracture were elicited.  Results:   Age, PSA, Gleason score, prostate size, estimated blood loss, body mass index, and clinical and pathologic stage between the 2 groups were similar. Comparing the monofilament group and V-Loc™180 cohorts, average time to complete the anastomosis was similar (27.4 vs. 26.4 minutes, p = 0.73) as was the rate of urinary extravasation on cystogram (5.7 % vs. 8.6%, p = 0.65). There were no symptomatic bladder neck contractures noted at 5 months of follow-up. At 2 months, the percentage of patients using 2 or more pads per day was lower in the V-Loc™180 cohort (24% vs. 44%, p < 0.02). At 5 months, this difference was no longer evident.  Conclusions:   Time to complete the UVA was similar in the intervention and control groups. Rates of urine leak were also comparable.

This technology enables large-scale and quantitative analysis of gene matrices associated with specific disease phenotypes, therefore allowing screening for small molecules that can specifically intervene with disease-linked gene-expression events. By initially applying this multitarget strategy to the pressing problem of hormone-refractory prostate cancer, which tends to be accelerated by the current antiandrogen therapy, we identify Peruvoside, a cardiac glycoside, which can potently inhibit both androgen-sensitive and -resistant prostate cancer cells without triggering severe cytotoxicity. We further show that, despite transcriptional reprogramming in prostate cancer cells at different disease stages, the compound can effectively block androgen receptor-dependent gene expression by inducing rapid androgen receptor degradation via the proteasome pathway. These findings establish a genomics-based phenotypic screening approach capable of quickly connecting pathways of phenotypic response to the molecular mechanism of drug action, thus offering a unique pathway-centric strategy for drug discovery.""","""['Hairi Li', 'Hongyan Zhou', 'Dong Wang', 'Jinsong Qiu', 'Yu Zhou', 'Xiangqiang Li', 'Michael G Rosenfeld', 'Sheng Ding', 'Xiang-Dong Fu']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A""","""['Peruvoside, a Cardiac Glycoside, Induces Primitive Myeloid Leukemia Cell Death.', 'Chemical genomics reveals inhibition of breast cancer lung metastasis by Ponatinib via c-Jun.', 'Application of high-throughput, molecular-targeted screening to anticancer drug discovery.', 'Functionalised cyclopentadienyl zirconium compounds as potential anticancer drugs.', 'A chemical genetics approach for the discovery of apoptosis inducers: from phenotypic cell based HTS assay and structure-activity relationship studies, to identification of potential anticancer agents and molecular targets.', 'PHDs-seq: a large-scale phenotypic screening method for drug discovery through parallel multi-readout quantification.', 'Hypoxic Stress-Dependent Regulation of Na,K-ATPase in Ischemic Heart Disease.', 'Drug Repurposing: A New Hope in Drug Discovery for Prostate Cancer.', 'Integrating network pharmacology analysis and pharmacodynamic evaluation for exploring the active components and molecular mechanism of moutan seed coat extract to improve cognitive impairment.', 'Wenshenyang recipe treats infertility through hormonal regulation and inflammatory responses revealed by transcriptome analysis and network pharmacology.']"""

Such adaptive AR increase paradoxically is a liability in castrated hosts, however, when supraphysiologic androgen is acutely replaced. Cell synchronization/anti-androgen response is due to AR binding to replication complexes (RC) at origin of replication sites (ORS) in early G1 associated with licensing/restricting DNA for single round of duplication during S-phase. When CRPC cells are acutely exposed to supraphysiologic androgen, adaptively increased nuclear AR is over-stabilized, preventing sufficient degradation in mitosis, inhibiting DNA re-licensing, and thus death in the subsequent cell cycle. These mechanistic results and the fact that AR/RC binding occurs in metastatic CRPCs directly from patients provides a paradigm shifting rationale for bipolar androgen therapy (BAT) in patient progressing on chronic androgen ablation. BAT involves giving sequential cycles alternating between periods of acute supraphysiologic androgen followed by acute ablation to take advantage of vulnerability produced by adaptive auto-regulation and binding of AR to RC in CRPC cells.

Results:   Prostate cancer was diagnosed in 26% of the men. • A median of 30 cores was taken by TTSB. • Adenocarcinoma in >2 cores was detected in 58.5% and Gleason score ≥7 was detected in 46% of the diagnosed men. • Most of the tumours (83.3%) were found in the anterior zones of the gland, with a significantly higher number of positive cores vs the posterior zones (mean 4.9 vs 1.5, P= 0.015). • PSADT and PSAV were the only independent predictors of prostate cancer detection at multivariate analyses with odds ratios of 0.71 (P= 0.014) and 1.58 (P= 0.025), respectively.  Conclusions:   TTSB has a high prostate cancer-detection rate, especially in the anterior zones. • Men after at least two previous negative transrectal biopsy series and persistent suspicion of prostate cancer, as evidenced by rapid PSA dynamics, should be offered TTSB.""","""['Nicola J Mabjeesh', 'Ghalib Lidawi', 'Juza Chen', 'Larissa German', 'Haim Matzkin']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Transperineal prostate biopsy detects significant cancer in patients with elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels and previous negative transrectal biopsies.', 'Unilateral positive biopsies in low risk prostate cancer patients diagnosed with extended transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy schemes do not predict unilateral prostate cancer at radical prostatectomy.', 'Prostate cancer diagnosis using a saturation needle biopsy technique after previous negative sextant biopsies.', 'Prostate biopsy: who, how and when.

It is known that both lactate inhibition and carbohydrate restriction inhibit tumour growth. What is unknown is whether the two work synergistically together. This study adds that though the combination of lactate inhibition and carbohydrate restriction did not synergistically slow tumour growth in our model, we confirmed that carbohydrate restriction started after tumour inoculation slowed tumour growth. Moreover, lactate inhibition resulted in changes in the tumour microenvironment that may have implications for future metabolic targeting of prostate cancer growth.  Objective:   To determine if a no-carbohydrate ketogenic diet (NCKD) and lactate transporter inhibition can exert a synergistic effect on delaying prostate tumour growth in a xenograft mouse model of human prostate cancer.  Materials and methods:   120 nude athymic male mice (aged 6-8 weeks) were injected s.c. in the flank with 1.0 × 10(5) LAPC-4 prostate cancer cells. • Mice were randomized to one of four treatment groups: Western diet (WD, 35% fat, 16% protein, 49% carbohydrate) and vehicle (Veh) treatment; WD and mono-carboxylate transporter-1 (MCT1) inhibition via α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamate (CHC) delivered through a mini osmotic pump; NCKD (84% fat, 16% protein, 0% carbohydrate) plus Veh; or NCKD and MCT1 inhibition. • Mice were fed and weighed three times per week and feed was adjusted to maintain similar body weights. • Tumour size was measured twice weekly and the combined effect of treatment was tested via Kruskal-Wallis analysis of all four groups. Independent effects of treatment (NCKD vs WD and CHC vs Veh) on tumour volume were tested using linear regression analysis. • All mice were killed on Day 53 (conclusion of pump ejection), and serum and tumour sections were analysed for various markers. Again, combined and independent effects of treatment were tested using Kruskal-Wallis and linear regression analysis, respectively.  Results:   There were no significant differences in tumour volumes among the four groups (P= 0.09). • When testing the independent effects of treatment, NCKD was significantly associated with lower tumour volumes at the end of the experiment (P= 0.026), while CHC administration was not (P= 0.981). However, CHC was associated with increased necrotic fraction (P < 0.001).

Transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS)-guided biopsies can miss prostate cancer and misclassify risk in a diagnostic setting; the exact extent to which it does so in a repeat biopsy strategy in men with low-intermediate risk prostate cancer is unknown. A simulation study of different biopsy strategies showed that repeat 12-core TRUS biopsy performs poorly. Adding anterior sampling improves on this but the highest accuracy is achieved using transperineal template prostate mapping using a 5 mm sampling frame.  Objective:   To determine the effectiveness of two sampling strategies; repeat transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS)-biopsy and transperineal template prostate mapping (TPM) to detect and exclude lesions of ≥0.2 mL or ≥0.5 mL using computer simulation on reconstructed three-dimensional (3-D) computer models of radical whole-mount specimens.  Patients and methods:   Computer simulation on reconstructed 3-D computer models of radical whole-mount specimens was used to evaluate the performance characteristics of repeat TRUS-biopsy and TPM to detect and exclude lesions of ≥0.2 mL or ≥0.5 mL. In all, 107 consecutive cases were analysed (1999-2001) with simulations repeated 500 times for each biopsy strategy. TPM and five different TRUS-biopsy strategies were simulated; the latter involved a standard 12-core sampling and incorporated variable amounts of error, as well as the addition of anterior cores. Sensitivity, specificity, negative and positive predictive values for detection of lesions with a volume of ≥0.2 mL or ≥0.5 mL were calculated.  Results:   The mean (SD) age and PSA concentration were 61 (6.4) years and 8.5 (5.9) ng/mL, respectively.In all, 53% (57/107) had low-intermediate risk disease. In all, 665 foci were reconstructed; there were 149 foci ≥0.2 mL and 97 ≥ 0.5 mL in the full cohort and 68 ≥ 0.2 mL and 43 ≥ 0.5 mL in the low-intermediate risk group. Overall, TPM accuracy (area under the receiver operating curve, AUC) was ≈0.90 compared with AUC 0.70-0.80 for TRUS-biopsy. In addition, at best, TRUS-biopsy missed 30-40% of lesions of ≥0.2 mL and ≥0.5 mL whilst TPM missed 5% of such lesions.

To cast light on this question regarding use of open as compared to laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (LRP) the present study was conducted focusing on biochemical (PSA) recurrence-free survival of Japanese patients with clinically localized prostate carcinomas.  Materials and methods:   From April 2004 to December 2010 we identified 579 patients undergoing LRP (n=245) and retropubic radical prostatectomy (RRP) (n=334) who did not undergo immediate adjuvant therapy (radiation and/or hormonal) and whose PSA levels were lower than 25 ng/ml. Preoperative prostate specific antigen (PSA) level, clinical stage, biopsy Gleason score and pathological features were assessed and Kaplan-Meier estimates of biochemical recurrence (BCR)-free survival were compared. A Cox regression model analysis was performed to determine predictors of biochemical recurrence.  Results:   Median follow up was 35 months(2- 115). On univariate analysis the LRP group had a slightly lower pathological T stage (p<0.001), higher biopsy Gleason score (p<0.001), but much more organ confined disease (p=0.001) than the RRP group. BCR-free survival did not significantly differ between LRP and RRP groups with preoperative PSA <6, clinical stage T1c,T2a, pathological stage T3 or more, biopsy Gleason score of 8 or more, pathological Gleason score of 6 or less and 8 or more, extra-capsular extension and negative surgical margin. The 3-year BCR-free survival rates were 91.0%(RRP) and 82.2%(LRP) (p<0.001).  Conclusion:   We conclude that in general LRP may be associated with a less positive outcome than BCR for resection of low risk prostate cancers. Therefore indications for LRP should be very carefully monitored.""","""['Hidetoshi Akita', 'Takehiko Okamura', 'Ryosuke Ando', 'Daisuke Nagata', 'Hiromichi Naruyama', 'Yasuyuki Yamada', 'Taku Naiki', 'Takahiro Yasui', 'Keiichi Tozawa', 'Kenjiro Kohri']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Asian Pac J Cancer Prev""","""['Propensity score comparison of the various radical surgical techniques for high-risk prostate cancer.', 'Biochemical (prostate specific antigen) recurrence probability following radical prostatectomy for clinically localized prostate cancer.', 'Radical prostatectomy and positive surgical margins: relationship with prostate cancer outcome.', 'Long-term oncological outcomes after laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.', 'Systematic review and meta-analysis of studies reporting oncologic outcome after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Transurethral marking incision of the bladder neck: a helpful technique in robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy involving post-transurethral resection of the prostate and cancers protruding into the bladder neck.']"""

While only a handful of lncRNAs have been characterized, their involvement in fundamental cellular processes that control gene expression highlights a central role in cell homeostasis. Not surprisingly, aberrant expression of regulatory lncRNAs has been increasingly documented in different types of cancer, where they can mediate both oncogenic or tumor suppressor effects. Interaction with chromatin remodeling complexes that promote silencing of specific genes or modulation of splicing factor proteins seem to be two general modes of lncRNA regulation, but it is conceivable that additional mechanisms of action are yet to be unveiled. LncRNAs show greater tissue specificity compared to protein-coding mRNAs making them attractive in the search of novel diagnostics/prognostics cancer biomarkers in body fluid samples. In fact, lncRNA prostate cancer antigen 3 can be detected in urine samples and has been shown to improve diagnosis of prostate cancer. We suggest that an unbiased screening of the presence of RNAs in easily accessible body fluids such as serum and urine might reveal novel circulating lncRNAs as potential biomarkers in many types of cancer.

The exact role of this pathway in prostate cancer (PC) has not been identified yet. Herein, we evaluate the expression of farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase (FPPS), the key enzyme of the mevalonate pathway, in PC.  Patients and methods:   Prostate cancer (PC) and benign prostate tissue of 114 men who underwent radical prostatectomy were constructed to a tissue microarray. Immunohistochemical staining of FPPS was quantified by the Remmele/Stegner immunoreactivity-score. Patients' clinical follow-up was assessed. IRS was correlated to pathological and clinical data. The impact of FPPS expression on clinical course was assessed univariate and multivariate.  Results:   Mean IRS in PC and benign tissue was 5.7 (95% CI 5.0-6.5) and 2.6 (2.1-3.0, p < 0.0001). Mean IRS in PC tissue of patients with organ-confined and locally advanced disease (pT ≥ 3) was 5.09 (4.22-5.96) and 6.87 (5.57-8.17, p = 0.035). IRS of PC tissue significantly correlated with Gleason score (p = 0.03). Patients with PC tissue IRS >3 showed shorter recurrence-free survival compared to the remaining (p = 0.01). Increased FPPS expression is an independent risk factor for early biochemical recurrence (p = 0.032).  Conclusions:   This is the first study on FPPS in PC specimens. The association of FPPS with established histopathological risk parameters and biochemical recurrence implicates a contribution of the mevalonate pathway to PC progression. Further functional analysis is required to explore the role of this pathway in PC and to investigate whether FPPS expression affects the response of PC cells to N-BPs.""","""['Tilman Todenhöfer', 'Jörg Hennenlotter', 'Ursula Kühs', 'Valentina Gerber', 'Georgios Gakis', 'Ulrich Vogel', 'Stefan Aufderklamm', 'Axel Merseburger', 'Judith Knapp', 'Arnulf Stenzl', 'Christian Schwentner']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""World J Urol""","""['Nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates can inhibit angiogenesis in vivo without the involvement of farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase.', 'Correlation between time-dependent inhibition of human farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase and blockade of mevalonate pathway by nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates in cultured cells.', 'Farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase modulators: a patent review (2006 - 2010).', 'Human farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase is allosterically inhibited by its own product.', 'Computational insights into binding of bisphosphates to farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase.', 'The role of lipid metabolism in cancer radioresistance.', 'PT-112 Induces Mitochondrial Stress and Immunogenic Cell Death, Targeting Tumor Cells with Mitochondrial Deficiencies.', 'Prenylation Defects and Oxidative Stress Trigger the Main Consequences of Neuroinflammation Linked to Mevalonate Pathway Deregulation.', 'Enzymes in the Cholesterol Synthesis Pathway: Interactomics in the Cancer Context.', 'Targeting SREBP-2-Regulated Mevalonate Metabolism for Cancer Therapy.']"""

We also found that lactacystin decreased AR-DNA binding 3-fold in LNCaP but no binding decrease was observed in LN-sip53.

However, exposure of DU-145 cells to the demethylating agent, 5-aza-2'deoxycytidine, restores the TM expression and its control by retinoic acid, NF-κB- and GSK3-β-dependent signalling. In conclusion, the study establishes that in prostate cancer cell lines relative to PrEC the TM is down-regulated and that the TM promoter is hypermethylated, which seems to be responsible for the down-regulation and failed regulation of TM expression in DU-145 cells.""","""['Mario Menschikowski', 'Albert Hagelgans', 'Oliver Tiebel', 'Margot Vogel', 'Graeme Eisenhofer', 'Gabriele Siegert']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Cancer Lett""","""['Deregulated expression of urokinase and its inhibitor type 1 in prostate cancer cells: role of epigenetic mechanisms.', 'DNA methylation paradigm shift: 15-lipoxygenase-1 upregulation in prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and prostate cancer by atypical promoter hypermethylation.', 'CpG methylation at promoter site -140 inactivates TGFbeta2 receptor gene in prostate cancer.', 'Increased heparanase expression is caused by promoter hypomethylation and up-regulation of transcriptional factor early growth response-1 in human prostate cancer.', 'CpG island promoter methylation and silencing of 14-3-3sigma gene expression in LNCaP and Tramp-C1 prostate cancer cell lines is associated with methyl-CpG-binding protein MBD2.', 'Recent Progress in Discovering the Role of Carotenoids and Their Metabolites in Prostatic Physiology and Pathology with a Focus on Prostate Cancer-A Review-Part I: Molecular Mechanisms of Carotenoid Action.', 'Identification of thrombomodulin as a dynamic monitoring biomarker for deep venous thrombosis evolution.', 'Activated thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFIa) attenuates breast cancer cell metastatic behaviors through inhibition of plasminogen activation and extracellular proteolysis.', 'Thrombomodulin expression regulates tumorigenesis in bladder cancer.', 'Thrombomodulin modulates cell migration in human melanoma cell lines.']"""

Methods:   Tissue biopsies banked from 332 fresh prostatectomy specimens were assessed for accuracy of diagnosis, comparing two separate methods of tumour identification: one in which tumour was identified in the gross specimen by visual inspection (n = 155) and one in which rapid frozen sectioning was applied (n = 177). The associations with correct tumour annotation and clinicopathological variables, including age, pre-operative prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels, pathological Gleason score, pathological T stage, tumour volume and surgical margins, were examined using univariable and multivariable binary logistic regression models.  Results:   For the gross visual inspection cohort the rate of correctly identifying and banking specimens containing prostate cancer was 69%. For the cohort assessed with rapid frozen sections, 94% of banked specimens actually had cancer. On multivariable analysis, we found that only frozen sectioning and tumour volume variables were independent predictors of correctly banked tumour specimens whilst all other routinely reported pathological variables had no influence on the success rates of fresh prostate tumour banking.

Methods:   A search of surgical pathology and consultation files was made for cystoprostatectomy specimens with confirmed urothelial carcinoma with prostatic stromal invasion. Intensity for both p63 and high molecular weight cytokeratin within the tumour cells were scored as negative/weak or strong.  Results:   A total of 34 cases were identified, 23 (68%) of which had associated foci of urothelial carcinoma with colonisation of prostatic ducts and acini. Mean patient age was 68.5 years (range 44-88 years). In all cases, basal cells of benign prostatic glands showed strong staining for both p63 and high molecular weight cytokeratin. Seventeen of 34 cases (50%) of urothelial carcinoma showed no or weak expression of high molecular weight cytokeratin in the tumour cells. The other 17 cases (50%) of urothelial carcinoma showed strong expression of high molecular weight cytokeratin in the tumour cells. Fourteen of 34 cases (41%) showed negative or weak expression of p63 in tumour cells. Twenty of 34 cases (59%) showed strong expression of p63 in tumour cells. In the 14 of 34 cases (41%) and 17 of 34 cases (50%) which showed negative/weak expression of p63 and high molecular weight cytokeratin, respectively, in the tumour cells, the positive staining of the basal cells by p63 and high molecular weight cytokeratin in the benign prostatic glands and acini or those colonised by urothelial carcinoma, aided in the distinction from urothelial carcinoma with prostatic stromal invasion. In the remaining 20 of 34 cases (59%) and 17 of 34 cases (50%) in which the tumour cells showed strong expression of p63 and high molecular weight cytokeratin, respectively, larger malignant tumour cells and smaller benign basal cells of the prostatic glands and acini were highlighted with these markers, and were easily distinguishable.

The need for more effective antitumor agents has led researchers to target signaling pathways that drive tumorigenesis by modulating or bypassing androgen receptor signaling--attenuation or blockade of which current treatments aim to effect. The transcription factor nuclear factor κB/p65 has been implicated in prostate cancer progression; however, few studies have examined the involvement of nuclear factor κB in hormone-naive disease. We used immunohistochemistry to investigate expression of p65, androgen receptor, Ki-67, and phosphorylation status of p65 at serine 536, in 154 tumor samples taken from patients before hormone ablation or radical treatment. Nuclear p65 expression was significantly associated with disease-specific mortality: P = .005; hazard ratio, 2.2. When patients were stratified according to androgen receptor status, this relationship was abolished in low androgen receptor-expressing patients and potentiated in high androgen receptor-expressing patients: P = .002; hazard ratio, 3.1. Ki-67 expression was also prognostic of shorter disease-specific mortality: P = .001; hazard ratio, 2.3. When the cohort was stratified according to androgen receptor status, this relationship held for high androgen receptor expressers but not low expressers: P = .0003; hazard ratio, 3.5.

However, whether IQGAP2 also suppresses prostate tumorigenesis remains unclear. We report here that IQGAP2 is a candidate tumour suppressor of prostate cancer (PC). Elevated IQGAP2 was detected in prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN), early stages of PCs (Gleason score ≤3), and androgen-dependent LNCaP PC cells. However, IQGAP2 was expressed at substantially reduced levels not only in prostate glands and non-tumorigenic BPH-1 prostate epithelial cells but also in advanced (Gleason score 4 or 5) and androgen-independent PCs. Furthermore, xenograft tumours that were derived from stem-like DU145 cells displayed advanced features and lower levels of IQGAP2 in comparison to xenograft tumours that were produced from non stem-like DU145 cells. Collectively, these results suggest that IQGAP2 functions in the surveillance of prostate tumorigenesis. Consistent with this concept, ectopic IQGAP2 reduced the proliferation of DU145, PC3, and 293T cells as well as the invasion ability of DU145 cells. While ectopic IQGAP2 up-regulated E-cadherin in DU145 and PC3 cells, knockdown of IQGAP2 reduced E-cadherin expression. In primary PC and DU145 cells-derived xenograft tumours, the majority of tumours with high levels of IQGAP2 were strongly-positive for E-cadherin. Therefore, IQGAP2 may suppress PC tumorigenesis, at least in part, by up-regulation of E-cadherin. Mechanistically, overexpression of IQGAP2 significantly reduced AKT activation in DU145 cells and inhibition of AKT activation upregulated E-cadherin, suggesting that IQGAP2 increases E-cadherin expression by inhibiting AKT activation.

Objective:   To assess the external validity of the European Randomised study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) Risk Calculator (RC) in a contemporary clinical cohort.  Methods:   The RC calculates the probability of a positive sextant prostate biopsy (P(posb)) using serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA), results of digital rectal examination, transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) and ultrasound assessed prostate volume. We prospectively validated the RC in 320 biopsied men (55-75 years), with no previous prostate biopsy, included in five Dutch hospitals in 2008-2011. If the P(posb) was ≥ 20% a biopsy was recommended. The performance of the RC was tested by comparing the observed outcomes to predicted probabilities, using the area under the curve (AUC) and decision curves analyses.  Results:   Compared to the screening cohort, men in the clinical cohort differed. They had higher PSA levels (median 6.8 versus 4.3 ng/ml, p<0.01), less TRUS-lesions (27% versus 34%, p = 0.01) and more prostate cancer (PCa) at biopsy (43% versus 25%, p<0.01). Mainly eight biopsy cores were taken. Despite the differences between these cohorts, the mean observed probability agreed with the mean predicted probability (43% versus 40%). The RC predicted P(posb) better than a model with PSA and digital rectal examination, AUC 0.77 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.72-0.83) and 0.71 (95%CI 0.65-0.76, p<0.01), respectively. This was confirmed by the decision curves analysis. Under the 20% threshold, 17% (11/63) of the biopsied men were diagnosed with PCa. Two of 11 men had an important cancer (Gleason 3+4).

The authors explored whether tobacco use adversely impacts treatment outcomes in men treated with permanent interstitial brachytherapy.  Methods and materials:   From April 1995 to August 2008, 2057 patients underwent brachytherapy by a single brachytherapist. Median follow-up was 7.5 years. The role of tobacco use as a prognostic factor for biochemical progression-free survival, cause-specific survival, and overall survival was investigated. Differences in survival between smokers and nonsmokers were compared using Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank tests.  Results:   Current smokers presented with a lower body mass index (p<0.001), smaller prostate size (p=0.003), younger age (p<0.001), higher prostate-specific antigen level (p=0.002), a trend toward higher percentage biopsy core involvement (p=0.08), higher incidence of perineural invasion (p=0.015), and higher risk disease (p<0.001) than former or nonsmokers. There was no difference in biochemical progression-free survival (p=0.30) or cause-specific survival (p=0.72) at 10 years for smokers compared with nonsmokers. On univariate and multivariate analysis, tobacco use was an adverse risk factor for overall survival (p<0.001). There was no association between smoking and any prostate cancer-specific outcome.

To explore these potential mechanisms, brewed GT was administered instead of drinking water to male severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice with androgen-dependent human LAPC4 prostate cancer cell subcutaneous xenografts. Tumor volume was decreased significantly in mice consuming GT, and tumor size was significantly correlated with GT polyphenol (GTP) content in tumor tissue. There was a significant reduction in hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha and vascular endothelial growth factor protein expression. GT consumption significantly reduced oxidative DNA and protein damage in tumor tissue as determined by 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine/deoxyguanosine ratio and protein carbonyl assay, respectively. Methylation is known to inhibit antioxidative enzymes such as glutathione S-transferase pi to permit reactive oxygen species promotion of tumor growth. GT inhibited tumor 5-cytosine DNA methyltransferase 1 mRNA and protein expression significantly, which may contribute to the inhibition of tumor growth by reactivation of antioxidative enzymes. This study advances our understanding of tumor growth inhibition by brewed GT in an animal model by demonstrating tissue localization of GTPs in correlation with inhibition of tumor growth.

Currently the most relevant prognostic factor to predict a patient's risk of death due to prostate cancer is the Gleason score of the biopsied tissue samples. However, pathological analysis is subjective, and the Gleason score is only a qualitative estimate of the cancer malignancy. Molecular biomarkers and diagnostic tests that can accurately predict prostate tumor aggressiveness are rather limited.  Method:   We report here for the first time the development of a nanoparticle test that not only can distinguish prostate cancer from normal and benign conditions, but also has the potential to predict the aggressiveness of prostate cancer quantitatively. To conduct the test, a prostate tissue lysate sample is spiked into a blood serum or human IgG solution and the spiked sample is incubated with a citrate-protected gold nanoparticle solution. IgG is known to adsorb to citrate-protected gold nanoparticles to form a ""protein corona"" on the nanoparticle surface. From this study, we discovered that certain tumor-specific molecules can interact with IgG and change the adsorption behavior of IgG to the gold nanoparticles. This change is reflected in the nanoparticle size of the assay solution and detected by a dynamic light scattering technique. Assay data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA for multiple variant analysis, and using the Student t-test or nonparametric Mann-Whitney U-tests for pairwise analyses.  Results:   An inverse, quantitative correlation of the average nanoparticle size of the assay solution with tumor status and histological diagnostic grading was observed from the nanoparticle test. IgG solutions spiked with prostate tumor tissue exhibit significantly smaller nanoparticle size than the solutions spiked with normal and benign tissues. The higher grade the tumor is, the smaller the nanoparticle size is. The test particularly revealed large differences among the intermediate Grade 2 tumors, and suggested the need to treat them differently.  Conclusion:   Development of a new nanoparticle test may provide a quantitative measure of the prostate cancer aggressiveness. If validated in a larger study of patients with prostate cancer, this test could become a new diagnostic tool in conjunction with Gleason Score pathology diagnostics to better distinguish aggressive cancer from indolent tumor.""","""['Qun Huo', 'Sally A Litherland', 'Shannon Sullivan', 'Hillari Hallquist', 'David A Decker', 'Inoel Rivera-Ramirez']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""J Transl Med""","""['Gold nanoparticle-enabled blood test for early stage cancer detection and risk assessment.', 'A facile nanoparticle immunoassay for cancer biomarker discovery.', 'Different interaction modes of biomolecules with citrate-capped gold nanoparticles.', 'The 2014 International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) Consensus Conference on Gleason Grading of Prostatic Carcinoma: Definition of Grading Patterns and Proposal for a New Grading System.', 'Do Gleason patterns 3 and 4 prostate cancer represent separate disease states?', 'Self-Therapeutic Nanomaterials: Applications in Biology and Medicine.', 'A rapid blood test to monitor immunity shift during pregnancy and potential application for animal health management.', 'Computational advances of tumor marker selection and sample classification in cancer proteomics.', 'An Ultra-Rapid Biosensory Point-of-Care (POC) Assay for Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) Detection in Human Serum.', 'A Monte Carlo study of I-125 prostate brachytherapy with gold nanoparticles: dose enhancement with simultaneous rectal dose sparing via radiation shielding.']"""

Having analysed the data of the 2260 multidisciplinary clinics held from March 2005 to March 2011, our dynamic and modifiable organisational model was evaluated for ways to optimise the human resources, offer high-quality standards, meet new needs and ultimately reduce costs. The study is focused on the organisational aspects and adds a perspective from one of the major oncological centres of reference in Italy and in Europe.  Objectives:   To describe the establishing of a multidisciplinary clinic for men with prostate cancer at the Istituto Nazionale Tumori, Milan. • To evaluate the quality of care provided and to describe the management changes implemented to improve standards and meet new needs.  Materials and methods:   In March 2005, we established a multidisciplinary clinic comprising weekly clinics and case-discussion sessions. • We have altered the organisational model periodically to meet new needs and improve quality.  Results:   We held 2260 multidisciplinary clinics up to March 2011. • For stage distribution, patients with low-risk prostate cancer increased to a peak of 61% in 2009, probably because of the anticipation of diagnosis and the active surveillance expertise of the Prostate Cancer Programme at Istituto Nazionale Tumori, Milan. The slight decrease in 2010 might be due to the availability of robot-assisted prostatectomy in several hospitals in Milan, and the start of a multicentre active surveillance protocol in December 2009. • In terms of the efficacy of our multidisciplinary strategy, 11% of drug therapies (mostly hormones) prescribed outside our institute were terminated in the multidisciplinary clinic, and 6% of indications formulated in the multidisciplinary clinics were altered during the case-discussion sessions.  Conclusions:   The multidisciplinary approach needs to be adaptable to meet new needs and improve quality. • Our experience has proved successful for both physicians and patients. The team agrees on strategies; complex cases are managed by a multidisciplinary team; dedicated psychologists contribute their knowledge and perspectives; and patients report the feeling of being cared for.""","""['Tiziana Magnani', 'Riccardo Valdagni', 'Roberto Salvioni', 'Sergio Villa', 'Lara Bellardita', 'Simona Donegani', 'Nicola Nicolai', 'Giuseppe Procopio', 'Nice Bedini', 'Tiziana Rancati', 'Nadia Zaffaroni']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['The requirements of a specialist Prostate Cancer Unit: a discussion paper from the European School of Oncology.', 'PCA: prostate cancer, patient-centred approach or both?', ""How has the impact of 'care pathway technologies' on service integration in stroke care been measured and what is the strength of the evidence to support their effectiveness in this respect?"", 'Multidisciplinary care and management selection in prostate cancer.', 'An innovative off-campus infusion suite designed to improve experiences of patients with cancer.', 'Do Multidisciplinary Tumor Board Discussions Correlate With Increase in 5-Year Survival?

Topics addressed include incidence, prevalence, mortality rates, health expenditures and costs of care, and effect on caregivers and society. The report also explores issues that arise when people with AD and other dementias live alone. The characteristics, risks, and unmet needs of this population are described. An estimated 5.4 million Americans have AD, including approximately 200,000 age <65 years who comprise the younger-onset AD population. Over the coming decades, the aging of the baby boom generation is projected to result in an additional 10 million people with AD. Today, someone in America develops AD every 68 seconds. By 2050, there is expected to be one new case of AD every 33 seconds, or nearly a million new cases per year, and AD prevalence is projected to be 11 million to 16 million. Dramatic increases in the number of ""oldest-old"" (those age ≥85 years) across all racial and ethnic groups are expected to contribute to the increased prevalence of AD. AD is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States and the fifth leading cause of death in Americans age ≥65 years. Although the proportions of deaths due to other major causes of death have decreased in the last several years, the proportion due to AD has risen significantly. Between 2000 and 2008, the proportion of deaths due to heart disease, stroke, and prostate cancer decreased by 13%, 20%, and 8%, respectively, whereas the proportion due to AD increased by 66%. In 2011, more than 15 million family members and other unpaid caregivers provided an estimated 17.4 billion hours of care to people with AD and other dementias, a contribution valued at more than $210 billion. Medicare payments for services to beneficiaries age ≥65 years with AD and other dementias are three times as great as payments for beneficiaries without these conditions, and Medicaid payments are 19 times as great. In 2012, payments for health care, long-term care, and hospice services for people age ≥65 years with AD and other dementias are expected to be $200 billion (not including the contributions of unpaid caregivers). An estimated 800,000 people with AD (one in seven) live alone, and up to half of them do not have an identifiable caregiver. People with dementia who live alone are exposed to risks that exceed the risks encountered by people with dementia who live with others, including inadequate self-care, malnutrition, untreated medical conditions, falls, wandering from home unattended, and accidental deaths.""","""[""Alzheimer's Association""]""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Alzheimers Dement""","""[""2010 Alzheimer's disease facts and figures."", ""2011 Alzheimer's disease facts and figures."", ""2009 Alzheimer's disease facts and figures."", ""The costs of Alzheimer's disease and the value of effective therapies."", ""The growing burden of Alzheimer's disease."", ""Using community-based geographical information system (GIS) to recruit older Asian Americans in an Alzheimer's disease study."", ""Single-cell RNA sequencing data reveals rewiring of transcriptional relationships in Alzheimer's Disease associated with risk variants."", 'The value of supportive care: A systematic review of cost-effectiveness of non-pharmacological interventions for dementia.', ""A study of auxiliary screening for Alzheimer's disease based on handwriting characteristics."", 'Selective Targeting of Class I HDAC Reduces Microglial Inflammation in the Entorhinal Cortex of Young APP/PS1 Mice.']"""

Methods:   (11)C-choline PET/CT and MRI were performed in 17 patients with untreated primary prostate cancer, followed by prostatectomy. Registration of in vivo imaging with histology was achieved using a mutual-information objective function and by performing ex vivo MRI of the prostatectomy specimen (obtained at 3 T) and whole-mount sectioning with block-face photography as intermediate steps. Data analysis included volumetrically registered whole-mount histology with Gleason scoring, (11)C-choline, and ADC data (obtained at 1.5 T). Volumes of interest were defined on the basis of histologically proven tumor tissue to calculate tumor-to-benign prostate background ratios (TBRs) for (11)C-choline, ADC, and a derived fusion PET/MRI parameter calculating the quotient of (11)C-choline over ADC (P(CHOL/ADC)).  Results:   Fifty-one tumor nodules were identified at pathology. The TBRs for (11)C-choline (P < 0.05) and P(CHOL/ADC) (P < 0.005) were significantly higher in prostate cancers with a Gleason score of ≥3 + 4 than with a Gleason score of ≤3 + 3 disease and controls. For Gleason ≥ 3 + 4, the ADC TBRs were significantly lower than controls and Gleason ≤ 3 + 3 disease (P < 0.05). The absolute value of TBRs obtained from Gleason ≥ 3 + 4 cancers increased from ADC to (11)C-choline PET/CT and from (11)C-choline PET/CT to P(CHOL/ADC), with each step being statistically significant.  Conclusion:   Our data indicate that parametric PET/MRI using P(CHOL/ADC) improves lesion-to-background contrast (TBRs) of Gleason ≥ 3 + 4 disease, compared with (11)C-choline PET/CT or diffusion-weighted MRI, and thus hold promise that parametric imaging performed on hybrid PET/MRI may further improve identification and localization of significant primary prostate cancer.""","""['Hyunjin Park', 'David Wood', 'Hero Hussain', 'Charles R Meyer', 'Rajal B Shah', 'Timothy D Johnson', 'Thomas Chenevert', 'Morand Piert']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""['Detection of aggressive primary prostate cancer with 11C-choline PET/CT using multimodality fusion techniques.', 'Index lesion characterization by (11)C-Choline PET/CT and Apparent Diffusion Coefficient parameters at 3 Tesla MRI in primary prostate carcinoma.', 'Is there an additional value of ¹¹C-choline PET-CT to T2-weighted MRI images in the localization of intraprostatic tumor nodules?', 'Imaging of prostate cancer with PET/CT and radioactively labeled choline derivates.', 'Challenges in accurate registration of 3-D medical imaging and histopathology in primary prostate cancer.', 'Magnetic Fields and Cancer: Epidemiology, Cellular Biology, and Theranostics.', 'MRI/PET Imaging in elevated PSA and localized prostate cancer: a narrative review.', 'The impact of the co-registration technique and analysis methodology in comparison studies between advanced imaging modalities and whole-mount-histology reference in primary prostate cancer.', 'Contrast-enhanced dual mode imaging: photoacoustic imaging plus more.', 'Comparison of PET/CT and whole-mount histopathology sections of the human prostate: a new strategy for voxel-wise evaluation.']"""

In the context of increasing fluoroquinolone resistance, and the international emergence of fluoroquinolone-resistant sequence type 131 (ST131) Escherichia coli, we describe a large series of E. coli bacteremia after TRUS biopsy.  Methods:   All male patients admitted with community-onset (CO) E. coli bacteremia from January 2006 through December 2010 were included. Patient characteristics, treatment outcomes, and rates of antimicrobial resistance were compared between patients with TRUS biopsy-related bacteremia and other male patients with CO E. coli bacteremia. Molecular typing was performed on E. coli isolates to determine phylogenetic group.  Results:   A total of 258 male patients were admitted with CO E. coli bacteremia. Of these, 47 patients (18%) were admitted after TRUS biopsy. Patients who had undergone TRUS biopsy were twice as likely to require intensive care admission (25% vs 12%) and had significantly higher rates of resistance to gentamicin (43%), trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole (60%), and ciprofloxacin (62%) as well as all 3 agents in combination (19%). Thirty-six percent of post-TRUS biopsy patients did not receive active empirical antibiotic therapy. The ST131 clone accounted for 41% of all E. coli isolates after TRUS biopsy.  Conclusions:   E. coli bacteremia can be a life-threatening complication of TRUS biopsy. Infecting strains are frequently multidrug-resistant and resistant to common empirical antibiotic agents. E. coli ST131 is an important cause of sepsis after TRUS biopsy. Further studies should evaluate colonization with fluoroquinolone-resistant E. coli as a risk factor for postbiopsy sepsis.""","""['Deborah A Williamson', 'Sally A Roberts', 'David L Paterson', 'Hanna Sidjabat', 'Anna Silvey', 'Jonathan Masters', 'Michael Rice', 'Joshua T Freeman']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Clin Infect Dis""","""['Escherichia coli bloodstream infection after transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy: our experience in North West London.', 'Clinical and molecular correlates of virulence in Escherichia coli causing bloodstream infection following transrectal ultrasound-guided (TRUS) prostate biopsy.', 'Prevalence of fluoroquinolone-resistant Escherichia coli before and incidence of acute bacterial prostatitis after prostate biopsy.', 'Comparative Effectiveness of Single versus Combination Antibiotic Prophylaxis for Infections after Transrectal Prostate Biopsy.', 'Infectious complications following transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy: new challenges in the era of multidrug-resistant Escherichia coli.', 'Levofloxacin resistant Escherichia coli sepsis following an ultrasound-guided transrectal prostate biopsy: report of four cases and review of the literature.', 'MRI Screening and MRI/US Fusion-Guided Transperineal Biopsy in Detecting Prostate Cancer.', 'Cefixime versus prulifloxacin as a prophylactic treatment for prostate biopsy: a randomized study.', 'Transperineal prostate biopsy: The modern gold standard to prostate cancer diagnosis.', 'Antibiotic Multidrug Resistance of Escherichia coli Causing Device- and Procedure-related Infections in the United States Reported to the National Healthcare Safety Network, 2013-2017.', 'Impact of insertion sequences on convergent evolution of Shigella species.']"""

The authors recruited 640 localized PCa patients from the Texas Medical Center, Houston, Texas, between 1996 and 2004. The authors used a structured questionnaire to collect data through personal interviews. Three main treatment modalities for localized PCa, consisting of surgery, radiation therapy, and watchful waiting, were considered for this study. It was found that health professionals were less likely to discuss surgery (odds ratio [OR] = 0.35, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.18-0.68) and watchful waiting (OR = 0.53, 95% CI = 0.34-0.83) with Hispanics than Whites. However, African Americans were less likely to receive watchful waiting (OR = 0.22, 95% CI = 0.05-0.93).

Higher age was associated with lower likelihood of discussing, preferring, and receiving surgical treatment. Higher Gleason sum was associated with lower likelihood of discussing treatment.

While the use of α-methylacyl coA racemase and high molecular weight cytokeratins have aided in distinguishing benign mimics from malignancy, their sensitivity and specificity are limited. We studied 6C4, a monoclonal antibody to glutamate receptor 2, an excitatory amino acid receptor subunit distributed throughout the central nervous system, on benign prostatic epithelium, high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, and PC. Ten cases with post-atrophic or adenosis-like prostate glands were also stained with prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia 4, an immunostain cocktail against α-methylacyl coA racemase, p63, and high molecular weight cytokeratin, in parallel with 6C4. Immunoreactivity for 6C4 was graded as negative (0% to 10%), +1 (11%% to 50%), and +2 (>50%). Malignant epithelium was classified by Gleason patterns. Gleason patterns 4 and 5 were subdivided into cribriform or noncribriform type. Its utility in distinguishing postatrophic or adenosis-like glands from prostate cancer, both of which show absence of basal cells on prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia 4 immunostain, was also investigated. Our results revealed a statistically significant difference in staining of benign secretory prostatic epithelium, high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, and low Gleason pattern carcinomas. The results also showed 6C4 is a sensitive marker in separating basal cell negative postatrophic or adenosis-like glands from prostate carcinoma. In addition, there was a statistically significant difference between staining of cribriform versus noncribriform Gleason pattern 4 and 5 carcinomas.

Methods and materials:   A total of 29 patients underwent MRL and PET/CT for LN evaluation. The MRL and PET/CT data were analyzed independently. The number, size, and location of the LN metastases were determined. The location was described as within or outside the standard clinical target volume for elective pelvic irradiation as defined by the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group. Subsequently, the results from MRL and PET/CT were compared.  Results:   Of the 738 LNs visible on MRL, 151 were positive in 23 of 29 patients. Of the 132 LNs visible on PET/CT, 34 were positive in 13 of 29 patients. MRL detected significantly more positive LNs (p < 0.001) in more patients than PET/CT (p = 0.002).

We updated prostate-cancer mortality in the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer with 2 additional years of follow-up.  Methods:   The study involved 182,160 men between the ages of 50 and 74 years at entry, with a predefined core age group of 162,388 men 55 to 69 years of age. The trial was conducted in eight European countries. Men who were randomly assigned to the screening group were offered PSA-based screening, whereas those in the control group were not offered such screening. The primary outcome was mortality from prostate cancer.  Results:   After a median follow-up of 11 years in the core age group, the relative reduction in the risk of death from prostate cancer in the screening group was 21% (rate ratio, 0.79; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.68 to 0.91; P=0.001), and 29% after adjustment for noncompliance. The absolute reduction in mortality in the screening group was 0.10 deaths per 1000 person-years or 1.07 deaths per 1000 men who underwent randomization. The rate ratio for death from prostate cancer during follow-up years 10 and 11 was 0.62 (95% CI, 0.45 to 0.85; P=0.003). To prevent one death from prostate cancer at 11 years of follow-up, 1055 men would need to be invited for screening and 37 cancers would need to be detected.

Although AAT has some adverse side effects and data from breast cancer patients indicate that such side effects from hormonal therapies may contribute to anxiety and depression and may also hinder AAT treatment compliance, this issue has not been investigated within a sample of PCa patients. This study explores the incidence of AAT side effects in a sample of PCa patients, the links between those side effects and anxiety and depression, the possible ways in which these factors may contribute to AAT treatment noncompliance in PCa patients, and how psychosocial treatments might be developed to attend to this issue. 147 PCa patients completed questionnaires on demographic factors, treatment compliance, AAT side effects, anxiety and depression. About 18% of the sample reported AAT side effects, and there was a significant association between the presence of side effects and elevated anxiety and depression scores. Increased frequency of side effects was significantly associated with elevated anxiety, but not depression. The most powerful relationship between AAT side effects and anxiety-depression was for the subfactors of (1) Fatigue, Pain and Discomfort, and (2) Psychological Agitation and Pessimism. Although fatigue, pain, and discomfort may be outcomes of the hormonal treatment itself, psychological agitation and pessimism represent a discrete psychological pathway between AAT side effects and anxiety and depression and (potentially) treatment noncompliance.

What's known on the subject? and What does the study add? Many patients undergo serial biopsy with a low rate of detection of prostate cancer, and the rate of detection declines as more biopsies are pursued. Furthermore, the clinical significance of detected cancer appears to decline as well. It is important to follow all possible methods to detect cancer; however, there should be a parallel consideration for the clinical value for detection of these tumours with low malignant potential. The present study investigated in detail the total rate of cancer detection in serial biopsy and how many of these were deemed clinically insignificant. Moreover, it addressed the impact of detecting premalignant lesions on further detection of cancer in serial biopsy.  Objective:   Many patients pursue serial prostate biopsies after two consecutive negative biopsy sessions. The objective of this study is to determine the indications of serial prostate biopsy and to compare outcomes, including the risk of detecting clinically insignificant cancer using different biopsy protocols in this highly selected population.  Patients and methods:   • Most cases of prostate cancer are detected on initial or one repeat biopsy, but persistent suspicion of prostate cancer occasionally leads to serial biopsy, which we define as more than two biopsy sessions. We recently showed that transrectal saturation biopsy (sPBx) significantly increases cancer detection when compared with extended schemes (ePBx) in the initial repeat biopsy (second overall biopsy) population, and that most cases identified are clinically significant. • In the past decade, 479 men underwent 749 repeat prostate biopsies after two prior negative biopsy sessions. • The ePBx group included 347 biopsies with 10-14 cores. • The sPBx group included 402 biopsies with >20 cores. • We analysed overall cancer detection and risk of detecting clinically significant vs insignificant tumours.  Results:   Prostate cancer was detected in 15.9% of 749 serial biopsies, representing a cumulative prostate cancer detection rate of 24.8% (119/479 patients). • The sPBx group had a significantly higher detection rate per biopsy session (18.6% vs 12.7%, P= 0.026). • Nevertheless, most positive biopsies 75/119 (63%) revealed clinically insignificant cancer, including 74.6% of cancers detected by sPBx.  Conclusion:   In men with two prior negative prostate biopsies, prostate cancer detection remains low regardless of clinical indication or transrectal biopsy protocol; most cancers identified are clinically insignificant, suggesting the threshold to repeat biopsy after more than one negative session should be very high.""","""['Osama M Zaytoun', 'Andrew J Stephenson', 'Khaled Fareed', 'Ahmed El-Shafei', 'Tianming Gao', 'David Levy', 'J Stephen Jones']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Office based transrectal saturation biopsy improves prostate cancer detection compared to extended biopsy in the repeat biopsy population.', 'High detection rate of significant prostate tumours in anterior zones using transperineal ultrasound-guided template saturation biopsy.', 'Prostate biopsy: who, how and when.

Fifteen carers took part in focus groups and 19 were interviewed. Carers' needs varied and were often unmet because of barriers to existing services. Carers needed: information; emotional support; practical support; effective medical care for the patient. Barriers to carers meeting their needs included: lack of awareness of sources of help; lack of understanding of information; reluctance to ask for help; prioritising the patient's needs. Enablers included better signposting to information and sources of support, and assessment of their needs. Interventions to address these needs should be developed taking account of the barriers and enablers identified here, and the experience of reported interventions for carers of other cancer patients.

Methods:   We assessed 20 789 prostate cancer patients treated with radical prostatectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection between 2004 and 2006. Receiver operating characteristics analyses were used to define the probability of correctly staging lymph node metastases patients according to lymph node count. Univariable and multivariable regression analyses tested the relationship between lymph node count and lymph node metastases rate.  Results:   The average lymph node count was 6.4 (median 5.0). Overall, the lymph node metastases rate was 2.5%; and it resulted to be 0.2, 1.5 and 6.7% in low, intermediate and high-risk tumors, respectively. The rate of lymph node metastases was 3.5 and 6.7% in patients with 10 and 20 lymph node count, respectively. Removing 20 lymph nodes yielded a 90% probability of correctly staging lymph node metastases, regardless of risk group. In multivariable analysis, lymph node count was an independent predictor of lymph node metastases stage (odds ratio: 1.07, P < 0.001).  Conclusions:   A direct relationship might exist between the extent of pelvic lymph node dissection and the lymph node metastases rate. An extended pelvic lymph node dissection with at least 20 lymph nodes would offer correct lymph node staging in 90% of cases, regardless of tumor characteristics.

To fine-map this region, we imputed 642 SNPs within 100 Kb of rs2294008 in addition to 33 markers genotyped in one of the reported genome-wide association study in 8,652 subjects. A multivariable logistic regression model adjusted for rs2294008 revealed a unique signal, rs2978974 (r(2) = 0.02, D' = 0.19 with rs2294008). In the combined analysis of 5,393 cases and 7,324 controls, we detected a per-allele odds ratio (OR) = 1.11 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.06-1.17, P = 5.8 × 10(-5)] for rs2294008 and OR = 1.07 (95% CI = 1.02-1.13, P = 9.7 × 10(-3)) for rs2978974. The effect was stronger in carriers of both risk variants (OR = 1.24, 95% CI = 1.08-1.41, P = 1.8 × 10(-3)) and there was a significant multiplicative interaction (P = 0.035) between these two SNPs, which requires replication in future studies. The T risk allele of rs2294008 was associated with increased PSCA mRNA expression in two sets of bladder tumor samples (n = 36, P = 0.0007 and n = 34, P = 0.0054) and in normal bladder samples (n = 35, P = 0.0155), but rs2978974 was not associated with PSCA expression.

XIAP is the most potent member of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) family of the endogenous caspase inhibitors. Therefore, targeting XIAP may be a promising strategy for the treatment of apoptosis-resistant malignancies. In this study, we systematically studied the relationships of chemical structures of several novel ligands to their zinc (Zn)-binding ability, molecular target XIAP, and tumor cell death-inducing activity. We show that treatment of PC-3 prostate cancer and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells with these membrane-permeable Zn-chelators with different Zn affinities results in varying degrees of XIAP depletion. Following decreased level of XIAP expression, we also show apoptosis-related caspase activation and cellular morphological changes upon treatment with strong Zn-chelators N4Py and BnTPEN. Addition of Zn has a full protective effect on the cells treated with these chelators, while iron (Fe) addition has only partial protection that, however, can be further increased to a comparable level of protection as Zn by inhibition of ROS generation, indicating that cell death effects mediated by Fe- but not Zn-complexes involve redox cycling.

This has consequences to patient care and better methods of preoperatively determining ECE are required.  Methods:   We followed a biomarker development pathway and compared the preoperative serum expressions of VEGF-D, PEDF, IGF-I, IGFBP3, and CD14 in patients from the Irish Prostate Cancer Research Consortium (PCRC) with radical prostatectomy determined ECE against patients with nonECE.  Results:   The expression measurements of five proteins were fitted into a logistic regression model and backwards variable elimination methods were applied which resulted in a model with IGFBP3 and CD14 as the best combination biomarker panel. This panel was tested in an independent cohort of patients using an optimized multiplex electrochemiluminescence assay. Receiver operating characteristic curves were generated and the areas under the curve (AUC) were calculated as an estimation of prediction accuracy. The biomarker panel was validated with an AUC of 76.6%, and a sensitivity and specificity of 80% and 75% was obtained.  Conclusions:   This is the first internally validated, preoperative serum biomarker panel that identifies ECE in patients with Gleason score 7 PCa with AUC 76.6%.

Here, we aim to analyze the relevance of the recently identified member RASSF10 in prostate carcinogenesis.  Methods:   RASSF10 promoter methylation and mRNA expression were investigated by bisulfite-pyrosequencing and qRT-PCR, respectively, in prostate carcinoma (PCa) cell lines (LNCaP, 22Rv1, DU-145) and in 83 primary PCa and 53 primary benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) tissues obtained after radical prostatectomy. Histological localization of RASSF10 was done by in situ hybridization. To prove the epigenetic nature of RASSF10 down regulation, PCa cell lines were treated with 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine and trichostatin A. Potential function of RASSF10 was analyzed in LNCaP by colony formation and apoptosis assays.  Results:   RASSF10 mRNA was localized to cells of the basal layer of the prostatic gland. Absence (LNCaP) and decrease (22Rv1, DU-145) of RASSF10 expression was associated with promoter methylation and could be restored by demethylating agents. A link between RASSF10 mRNA reduction and promoter methylation was also detected in primary prostate tissues (P = 0.006), where PCa showed more frequently reduced RASSF10 levels when compared with BPH (33.7% vs. 13.2%, P = 0.009). RASSF10 methylation could be further associated with advanced tumor stage and advanced age (P-values < 0.05). Our preliminary functional assays revealed the ability of RASSF10 to inhibit colony formation (P = 0.018) and to increase apoptosis (P = 0.035).

Previously we discovered that gene fusions between the 5'-untranslated region of androgen regulated gene TMPRSS2 and the ETS transcription factor family members were present in a majority of the prostate cancer cases. The resulting aberrant overexpression of ETS genes drives tumor progression.  Methods:   Here, we evaluated the expression levels of 5α-reductase isoenzymes in prostate cancer cell lines and tissues. We tested the effect of dutasteride, a 5α-reductase inhibitor, in TMPRSS2-ERG fusion-positive VCaP cell proliferation and cell invasion. We also evaluated the effect of dutasteride on the TMPRSS2-ERG fusion gene expression. Finally, we tested dutasteride alone or in combination with an anti-androgen in VCaP cell xenografts tumor model.  Results:   Our data showed that 5α-reductase SRD5A1 and SRD5A3 isoenzymes that are responsible for the conversion of testosterone to DHT, are highly expressed in metastatic prostate cancer compared to benign and localized prostate cancer. Dutasteride treatment attenuated VCaP cell proliferation and invasion. VCaP cells pre-treated with dutasteride showed a reduction in ERG and PSA expression. In vivo studies demonstrated that dutasteride in combination with the anti-androgen bicalutamide significantly decreased tumor burden in VCaP cell xenograft model.  Conclusions:   Our findings suggest that dutasteride can inhibit ERG fusion-positive cell growth and in combination with anti-androgen, significantly reduce the tumor burden.

For this reason, the Hh pathway is a flourishing area for development of anticancer drugs such as Hh ligand antagonists (e.g., 5E1 and robotnikinin), Smo inhibitors (e.g., GDC-0449 and IPI-926), and Gli transcriptional activity inhibitors (e.g., GANT58 and GANT61). It is now clear that primary cilia are required for activation of the Hh pathway in normal vertebrate cells. It is in the primary cilium that both positive and negative effectors of the Hh pathway are processed by posttranslational modifications. In many cancers, preliminary results suggest that primary cilia are lost. As drugs that inhibit different steps of the Hh pathway are developed, it will be important to consider how these drugs will function in the context of primary cilia in the tumor environment. Here, we discuss why some of the Hh inhibitors may be ineffective if primary cilia are lost on cancer cells. Understanding the relationships between clinical inhibitors of the Hh pathway and the presence or absence of primary cilia may turn out to be critical for targeting these therapeutics to the correct population of patients and improving their efficacy.

However, the mechanism by which AQP1 protein expression is regulated in tumor cells remains to be fully elucidated. We hypothesized that hypoxia might play an important role in AQP1 induction during tumorigenesis and at the late stages of tumor development.  Methods:   Isotonic and serum-free hypoxic models were used to investigate AQP1 expression in PC-3M human prostate cancer cells.  Results:   AQP1 expression was up-regulated by density-induced pericellular hypoxia and cobalt(II) chloride (CoCl(2))-induced hypoxia at the transcriptional level. Moreover, phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) was induced by density-induced pericellular hypoxia and CoCl(2)-induced hypoxia, specific inhibitors of p38 MAPK could concentration-dependently block those effects of hypoxia on AQP1 expression. Intracellular calcium ion (Ca(2+)) and protein kinase C (PKC) were shown to be responsible for the activation of p38 MAPK pathway. In addition, AQP1 induction in dense cultures was dependent on lowered oxygen (O(2)) tension. In high cell density culture, certain secretory proteins might induce AQP1 expression indirectly.

Results:   Stimulation of PPAT explants with PCa PC3 CM induced adipokines associated with cancer progression (osteopontin, tumoral necrosis factor alpha and interleukin-6) and reduced the expression of the protective adipokine adiponectin. Notably, osteopontin protein expression was 13-fold upregulated. Matrix metalloproteinase 9 activity and mitochondrial DNA copy number were higher after stimulation with cancer CM. Stromovascular cells from PPAT in culture were not influenced by tumor-derived factors.

It is important for pathologists and urologists to compare RALP with conventional open radical retropubic prostatectomy (RRP), and evaluate their effects on surgical pathology specimens.  Methods:   We retrospectively reviewed and statistically analyzed 262 consecutive RALP (n = 182) and RRP (n = 80) procedures performed in our institution from 2007 to 2010. From these, 49 RALP and 33 RRP cases were randomly selected for additional microscopic examination to analyze the degree of capsular incision and the amount of residual prostate surface adipose tissue.  Results:   Positive surgical margins were present in 28.6% RALP and 57.5% RRP cases, a statistically significant difference. In patients with stage T2c tumors, which represent 61.2% RALP and 63.8% RRP patients, the positive surgical margin rate was 24.1% in the RALP group and 58.8% in the RRP group (statistically significant difference). For other pathologic stages, the differences in positive margins between RALP and RRP groups were not statistically significant. The incidence of positive surgical margins after RALP was related to higher tumor stage, higher Gleason score, higher tumor volume and lower prostate weight, but was not related to the surgeons performing the procedure. When compared with RRP, RALP also caused less severe prostatic capsular incision and maintained larger amounts of residual surface adipose tissue in prostatectomy specimens.  Conclusions:   In this study RALP showed a statistically significant lower positive surgical margin rate than RRP. Analysis of capsular incision and amount of prostatic surface residual adipose tissue suggested that RALP caused less prostatic capsular damage than RRP.

Our study was designed to assess global methylation levels of histone 4 lysine 20 (H4K20me1-3) at different stages of prostate cancer (PCA) carcinogenesis.  Methods:   Global H4K20 methylation levels were evaluated using a tissue microarray in patients with clinically localized PCA (n = 113), non-malignant prostate disease (n = 27), metastatic hormone-naive PCA (mPCA, n = 30) and castration-resistant PCA (CRPC, n = 34). Immunohistochemistry was performed to assess global levels of H4K20 methylation levels.  Results:   Similar proportions of the normal, PCA, and mPCA prostate tissues showed strong H4K20me3 staining. CRPC tissue analysis showed the weakest immunostaining levels of H4K20me1 and H4K20me2, compared to other prostate tissues. H4K20me2 methylation levels indicated significant differences in examined tissues except for normal prostate versus PCA tissue. H4K20me1 differentiates CRPC from other prostate tissues. H4K20me1 was significantly correlated with lymph node metastases, and H4K20me2 showed a significant correlation with the Gleason score.

We also assessed NBS1 mRNA expression among the different groups by quantitative real time (qRT)-polymerase chain reaction.

Methodology/principal findings:   In this study we analyzed the influence of PTEN expression on the outcome of a randomized clinical trial of conventional versus 7-days-a-week postoperative radiotherapy for squamous cell cancer of the head and neck. The patients with cancer of the oral cavity, oropharynx, and larynx were randomized to receive 63 Gy in fractions of 1.8 Gy given 5 days a week (CF) or 7 days a week (p-CAIR). Out of 279 patients enrolled in the study, 147 paraffin blocks were available for an immunohistochemical assessment of PTEN. To evaluate the prognostic value of PTEN expression and the effect of fractionation relative to PTEN, the data on the outcome of a randomized clinical trial were analyzed. Tumors with a high intensity of PTEN staining had significant gain in the loco-regional control (LRC) from p-CAIR (5-year LRC 92.7% vs. 70.8%, for p-CAIR vs. CF, p = 0.016, RR = 0.26). By contrast, tumors with low intensity of PTEN did not gain from p-CAIR (5-year LRC 56.2% vs. 47.2%, p = 0.49, RR = 0.94). The intensity of PTEN highly affected the LRC in a whole group of 147 patients (5-year LRC 80.9% vs. 52.3% for high vs. low PTEN, p = 0.0007, RR = 0.32). In multivariate Cox analysis, including neck node involvement, EGFR, nm23, Ki-67, p53, cyclin D1, tumor site and margins, PTEN remained an independent predictor of LRC (RR = 2.8 p = 0.004).

However, recent studies have shown increased osteolytic activity in the beginning stages of PCa bone metastases, suggesting that targeting both osteolytic and osteoblastic mediators would likely inhibit bone remodeling and PCa bone metastasis. In this study, we found that PCa cells could stimulate differentiation of osteoclasts and osteoblasts through the up-regulation of RANKL, RUNX2 and osteopontin, promoting bone remodeling. Interestingly, we found that formulated isoflavone and 3,3'-diindolylmethane (BR-DIM) were able to inhibit the differentiation of osteoclasts and osteoblasts through the inhibition of cell signal transduction in RANKL, osteoblastic, and PCa cell signaling. Moreover, we found that isoflavone and BR-DIM down-regulated the expression of miR-92a, which is known to be associated with RANKL signaling, EMT and cancer progression. By pathway and network analysis, we also observed the regulatory effects of isoflavone and BR-DIM on multiple signaling pathways such as AR/PSA, NKX3-1/Akt/p27, MITF, etc. Therefore, isoflavone and BR-DIM with their multi-targeted effects could be useful for the prevention of PCa progression, especially by attenuating bone metastasis mechanisms.""","""['Yiwei Li', 'Dejuan Kong', 'Aamir Ahmad', 'Bin Bao', 'Fazlul H Sarkar']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['DU145 human prostate cancer cells express functional receptor activator of NFkappaB: new insights in the prostate cancer bone metastasis process.', 'Regulation of Akt/FOXO3a/GSK-3beta/AR signaling network by isoflavone in prostate cancer cells.', 'Prostatic Acid Phosphatase Alters the RANKL/OPG System and Induces Osteoblastic Prostate Cancer Bone Metastases.', ""Role of BioResponse 3,3'-Diindolylmethane in the Treatment of Human Prostate Cancer: Clinical Experience."", 'Targeting the receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB (RANK) ligand in prostate cancer bone metastases.', ""3,3'-Diindolylmethane and its derivatives: nature-inspired strategies tackling drug resistant tumors by regulation of signal transduction, transcription factors and microRNAs."", 'MicroRNA mediated therapeutic effects of natural agents in prostate cancer.', 'AKT in Bone Metastasis of Solid Tumors: A Comprehensive Review.', ""Regulation of carcinogenesis and mediation through Wnt/β-catenin signaling by 3,3'-diindolylmethane in an enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer cell line."", 'Secretome analysis reveals upregulated granzyme B in human androgen-repressed prostate cancer cells with mesenchymal and invasive phenotype.']"""

Abiraterone, a rationally designed inhibitor of CYP17A1 recently approved for the treatment of docetaxel-treated castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), is often effective, but requires coadministration with glucocorticoids to curtail side effects. Here, we hypothesized that progressive disease on abiraterone may occur secondary to glucocorticoid-induced activation of mutated AR. We found that prednisolone plasma levels in patients with CRPC were sufficiently high to activate mutant AR. Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, such as spironolactone and eplerenone that are used to treat side effects related to mineralocorticoid excess, can also bind to and activate signaling through wild-type or mutant AR. Abiraterone inhibited in vitro proliferation and AR-regulated gene expression of AR-positive prostate cancer cells, which could be explained by AR antagonism in addition to inhibition of steroidogenesis. In fact, activation of mutant AR by eplerenone was inhibited by MDV3100, bicalutamide, or greater concentrations of abiraterone.

Logistic regression was used to identify associations between financial stress and strain and depression, anxiety and distress of (a) any severity and (b) severe or worse.  Results:   The response rate was 54%. Of 654 respondents, 49% reported increased financial stress and 32% increased financial strain due to cancer.

In particular, sexually transmitted infections (STIs) have been implicated in PCa etiology, and studies have found that the risk of acquiring a STI can be reduced with circumcision. Therefore, circumcision may reduce PCa risk.  Methods:   Participant data collected as part of 2 population-based case-control studies of PCa were analyzed. Self-reported circumcision status, age at circumcision, and age at first sexual intercourse were recorded along with a history of STIs or prostatitis. Multivariate logistic regression was used to estimate the relative risk of PCa by circumcision status.  Results:   Data from 1754 cases and 1645 controls were available. Circumcision before first sexual intercourse was associated with a 15% reduction in risk of PCa compared to that of uncircumcised men (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.73-0.99). This risk reduction was observed for cases with both less aggressive (odds ratio, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.74-1.04) and more aggressive (odds ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.66-1.00) PCa features.

However, the role of Axl in prostate cancer remains poorly understood, and the therapeutic efficacy of Axl targeting remains untested. In this report we identified Axl as a new therapeutic target for prostate cancer. Axl is consistently overexpressed in prostate cancer cell lines and human prostate tumors. Interestingly, the blockage of Axl gene expression strongly inhibits proliferation, migration, invasion and tumor growth. Furthermore, inhibition of Axl expression by small interfering RNA regulates a transcriptional program of genes involved in cell survival, strikingly all connected to the nuclear factor-κB pathway. Additionally, blockage of Axl expression leads to inhibition of Akt, IKKα and IκBα phosphorylation, increasing IκBα expression and stability. Furthermore, induction of Akt phosphorylation by insulin-like growth factor 1 in Axl knockdown cells restores Akt activity and proliferation.

Subcutaneous denosumab is superior to intravenous zoledronic acid (ZA) for the prevention of skeletal-related events (SREs) in patients with advanced solid tumors and bone metastases. This study sought to determine the lifetime cost-effectiveness of denosumab vs ZA in this setting, from a US managed-care perspective.  Methods:   A lifetime Markov model was developed, with relative rate reductions in SREs for denosumab vs ZA derived from three pivotal Phase 3 trials involving patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), breast cancer, and non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and bone metastases. The real-world SRE rates in ZA-treated patients were derived from a large commercial database. SRE and treatment administration quality-adjusted life year (QALY) decrements were estimated with time-trade-off studies. SRE costs were estimated from a nationally representative commercial claims database. Drug, drug administration, and renal monitoring costs were included. Costs and QALYs were discounted at 3% annually. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted.  Results:   Across tumor types, denosumab was associated with a reduced number of SREs, increased QALYs, and increased lifetime total costs vs ZA. The costs per QALY gained for denosumab vs ZA in CRPC, breast cancer, and NSCLC were $49,405, $78,915, and $67,931, respectively, commonly considered good value in the US. Costs per SRE avoided were $8567, $13,557, and $10,513, respectively. Results were sensitive to drug costs and SRE rates.  Limitations:   Differences in pain severity and analgesic use favoring denosumab over ZA were not captured. Mortality was extrapolated from fitted generalized gamma function beyond the trial duration.  Conclusion:   Denosumab is a cost-effective treatment option for the prevention of SREs in patients with advanced solid tumors and bone metastases compared to ZA. The overall value of denosumab is based on superior efficacy, favorable safety, and more efficient administration.""","""['Alison Stopeck', 'Michael Rader', 'David Henry', 'Mark Danese', 'Marc Halperin', 'Ze Cong', 'Yi Qian', 'Roger Dansey', 'Karen Chung']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""J Med Econ""","""['Re.: Cost-effectiveness of denosumab vs zoledronic acid for prevention of skeletal-related events in patients with solid tumors and bone metastases in the United States.', ""Authors' response to letter to the editor."", 'Economic evaluation of denosumab compared with zoledronic acid in hormone-refractory prostate cancer patients with bone metastases.', 'Denosumab versus zoledronic acid for treatment of bone metastases in men with castration-resistant prostate cancer: a cost-effectiveness analysis.', 'Cost-effectiveness of denosumab compared with zoledronic acid in patients with breast cancer and bone metastases.', 'Health-economic review of zoledronic acid for the management of skeletal-related events in bone-metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Zoledronic acid: a pharmacoeconomic review of its use in the management of bone metastases.', 'A bibliometric research based on hotspots and frontier trends of denosumab.', 'A Systematic Review of Time and Resource Use Costs of Subcutaneous Versus Intravenous Administration of Oncology Biologics in a Hospital Setting.', 'Real-world use of bone modifying agents in metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of 12-Versus 4-Weekly Administration of Bone-Targeted Agents in Patients with Bone Metastases from Breast and Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Early palliative radiation versus observation for high-risk asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic bone metastases: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.']"""

Of the many aspects of survivorship affected by prostate cancer, body image receives limited attention despite some indication that it may be important to men with the disease. The present study investigated how body image changes over time and the relations between changes in body image and quality of life (QOL) in men with prostate cancer.  Methods:   In a longitudinal design, patients (N = 74) completed questionnaires before treatment (T1) and at 1 month (T2) and 2 years (T3) following treatment completion.  Results:   Growth curve modeling indicated that there was no significant change over time in group-level body image scores. However, hormone treatment was associated with a negative trajectory of change over 2 years. Also, analysis of individual difference scores indicated that ≥50% of patients demonstrated change of at least 0.5 standard deviation between time points. Hierarchical regression indicated that change in body image between T1 and T2 was significantly associated with change in QOL between T1 and T3, while controlling for demographic variables, treatment, treatment-related functioning, and general and treatment-specific positive expectations. In predicting change in body image between T1 and T2, treatment-specific positive expectation was the only significant predictor.  Conclusions:   The present study demonstrates that body image is an important component of the prostate cancer experience.

The proteasome is a primary vehicle for selective degradation of damaged proteins in a cell and due to its role in cell proliferation, inhibition of the proteasome has become a target for cancer therapy. Metals are essential to the proteasome's normal function and have been used within proteasome-inhibiting complexes for cancer therapy. This study evaluated the association of erythrocyte metal levels and proteasome chymotrypsin-like (CT-like) activity in age- and race-matched prostate cancer cases (n=61) and controls (n=61). Erythrocyte metals were measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). CT-like activity was measured by proteasome activity assay using a fluorogenic peptide substrate. Among cases, significant correlations between individual toxic metals were observed (r(arsenic-cadmium)=0.49, p<0.001; r(arsenic-lead)=0.26, p=0.04, r(cadmium-lead) 0.53, p<0.001), but there were no significant associations between metals and CT-like activity. In contrast, within controls there were no significant associations between metals, however, copper and lead levels were significantly associated with CT-like activity. The associations between copper and lead and proteasome activity (r(copper-CT-like)=-0.28, p=0.002 ; r(lead-CT-like)=0.23, p=0.011) remained significant in multivariable models that included all of the metals. These findings suggest that biologically essential metals and toxic metals may affect proteasome activity in healthy controls and, further, show that prostate cancer cases and controls differ in associations between metals and proteasome activity in erythrocytes.

We show that CUL4A is frequently overexpressed in human primary prostate cancer and cell lines. Notably, subjects with tumors that highly expressed CUL4A had poor overall survival. CUL4A downregulation inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in vitro and in vivo, whereas CUL4A overexpression transformed human normal prostate epithelial cells and promoted invasion, which was attenuated by the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) inhibitor. We further show that the sensitivity to thalidomide is positively correlated with CUL4A expression in a panel of prostate cell lines. Ectopic CUL4A expression greatly enhanced sensitivity to thalidomide, while its downregulation conferred resistance to this drug. Mechanistically, thalidomide decreased CUL4A in a time- and dose-dependent manner, consequently leading to inaction of ERK pathway. Finally, we show that cereblon level is correlated with CUL4A expression and downregulated in thalidomide-resistant prostate cancer cell.

This effect, known as conditional survival, has not yet been assessed.  Objective:   Evaluate the conditional rates of UC and EF recovery after nerve-sparing RP (NSRP).  Design, setting, and participants:   We included 1135 PCa patients treated between January 2000 and June 2011 at a single referral center.  Intervention:   All patients underwent NSRP.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The Kaplan-Meier method assessed the time to recovery of UC (defined as an International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire score<6) and of EF (defined as an International Index of Erectile Function-Erectile Function score≥22). Cumulative survival estimates were used to generate conditional recovery rates assessed at a 6-mo interval. Multivariable Cox regression analyses were performed to predict functional outcomes recovery after accounting for confounders.  Results and limitations:   UC recovery rates were 89.5%, 94.7%, and 97.0% at 6-, 24-, and 36-mo follow-up, respectively. Corresponding EF recovery rates were 53.6%, 65.0%, and 67.5%, respectively. In patients who were still incontinent at 1, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, and 36 mo after surgery, UC recovery rates in the following 6-mo period significantly decreased as the time from surgery increased: 74.9%, 58.2%, 41.4%, 14.9%, 24.8%, 24.6%, and 13.3%, respectively. Similarly, in patients still impotent at the same time points, the 6-mo rate of sexual potency recovery was 36.9%, 26.8%, 17.8%, 8.2%, 3.1%, 4.0%, and 0%, respectively. Multivariable analyses confirmed these results. The study is limited by its retrospective design.

Inhibition studies of ccKDM5B showed both in vitro and in cell inhibition of ccKDM5B by 2,4-pyridinedicarboxylic acid (2,4-PDCA) with a potency similar to that reported for the HDM KDM4C.

The chemical structure of TOR differs from that of tamoxifen (TAM) by the presence of a chlorine atom in the ethyl side chain, resulting in a more favorable toxicity spectrum with TOR. In addition, some patients who fail on TAM therapy benefit from high-dose TOR therapy. Several studies have indicated that functional genetic variants in the TAM metabolic pathway influence response to therapy, but pharmacogenomic studies of patients treated with TOR are lacking. In this study, we examined individual variability in sulfation of 4-hydroxy TOR (4-OH TOR) (the active metabolite of TOR) in human liver cytosols from 104 subjects and found approximately 30-fold variation in activity. 4-OH TOR sulfation was significantly correlated (r = 0.98, P < 0.0001) with β-naphthol sulfation (diagnostic for SULT1A1) but not with 17β estradiol sulfation, a diagnostic substrate for SULT1E1(r = 0.09, P = 0.34).

Methods:   69 patients who underwent L-TME (n = 39) or R-TME (n = 30) were prospectively enrolled. Their urogenital function was evaluated by uroflowmetry, a standard questionnaire of the international prostate symptom score (IPSS) and the international index of erectile function (IIEF) before surgery and 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery. The pre- and postoperative IPSS and IIEF scores were compared to detect functional deterioration by paired t test for each group. How postoperative IPSS and IIEF scores and uroflowmetry data deviated from the preoperative values (Δ) were statistically compared between the two groups.  Results:   The IPSS score significantly increased 1 month after surgery; the recovery from decreased urinary function took 6 months for patients in the L-TME group (8.2 ± 6.3; P = 0.908) but 3 months in the R-TME group (8.36 ± 5.5; P = 0.075). The ΔIPSS scores were significantly different between the two groups at 3 months (P = 0.036). In male patients (L-TME 20, R-TME 18), the total IIEF score in R-TME and L-TME significantly decreased 1 month after surgery, L-TME gradually recovered over 12 months (46.00 ± 16.9; P = 0.269), but R-TME recovered within 6 months (44.61 ± 13.76; P = 0.067). The ΔIIEF score value was not significantly different at any time between the two groups, but in an itemized analysis of the change in erectile function and sexual desire, there were significant differences at 3 months between the two groups.

Changes in the risk were examined by plotting the SIR and its 95% confidence interval against time after the diagnosis of prostate cancer. The overall risk of SPC was significantly increased by 14% compared with the general male population. With regard to specific cancer types, a significantly increased risk of SPC was found for the urinary bladder, kidney, pancreas, melanoma of skin, leukemia, myeloma, brain/nervous system, renal pelvis/ureter, thyroid, and the small intestine. The absolute risk of SPC for most cancer types, however, was below 10 cases per 10 000 person-years. A significantly decreased risk of SPC was found in the lung/bronchus and the liver.

In order to invade, cells must detach from the primary tumor. Cell-cell and cell-ECM interactions are important regulators of cohesion--a property previously demonstrated to mediate cell detachment and invasion. The studies reported here propose a novel role for α5β1 integrin--the principle mediator of fibronectin matrix assembly (FNMA)--as an invasion suppressor of prostate cancer cells.  Methods:   Using a combination of biophysical and cell biological methods, and well-characterized prostate cancer cell lines of varying invasiveness, we explore the relationship between cohesion, invasiveness, and FNMA.  Results:   We show that cohesion is inversely proportional to invasive capacity. We also show that more invasive cells express lower levels of α5β1 integrin and lack the capacity for FNMA. Cells were generated to over-express either wild-type α5 integrin or an integrin in which the cytoplasmic domain of α5 was replaced with that of α2. The α2 construct does not promote FNMA. We show that only wild-type α5 integrin promotes aggregate compaction, increases cohesion, and reduces invasion of the more aggressive cells, and that these effects can be blocked by the 70-kDa fibronectin fragment.  Conclusions:   We propose that restoring capacity for FNMA in deficient cells can increase tumor intercellular cohesion to a point that significantly reduces cell detachment and subsequent invasion. In prostate cancer, this could be of therapeutic benefit by blocking an early key step in the metastatic cascade.""","""['Dongxuan Jia', 'Ildiko Entersz', 'Christine Butler', 'Ramsey A Foty']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Alpha5beta1 integrin mediates strong tissue cohesion.', 'Dexamethasone-Mediated Activation of Fibronectin Matrix Assembly Reduces Dispersal of Primary Human Glioblastoma Cells.', 'Fibronectin matrix assembly regulates alpha5beta1-mediated cell cohesion.', 'Modulation of MMPs by cell surface integrin receptor α5β1.', 'Cohesive cancer invasion of the biophysical barrier of smooth muscle.', 'The Prolactin Inducible Protein Modulates Antitumor Immune Responses and Metastasis in a Mouse Model of Triple Negative Breast Cancer.', 'An overview of neuroblastoma cell lineage phenotypes and in vitro models.', 'Teaching an Old Drug New Tricks: Dexamethasone as an In Vivo Inhibitor of Glioblastoma Dispersal.', 'Fibronectin in Cancer: Friend or Foe.', 'HDAC Inhibition Counteracts Metastatic Re-Activation of Prostate Cancer Cells Induced by Chronic mTOR Suppression.']"""

Through the screening of two genome-wide expression profile data sets, one for cells in which exogenous p53 was introduced and the other for senescent fibroblasts, we have identified chloride channel accessory 2 (CLCA2) as a p53-inducible senescence-associated gene. CLCA2 was remarkably induced by replicative senescence as well as oxidative stress in a p53-dependent manner. We also found that ectopically expressed CLCA2 induced cellular senescence, and the down-regulation of CLCA2 by small interfering RNA caused inhibition of oxidative stress-induced senescence. Interestingly, the reduced expression of CLCA2 was frequently observed in various kinds of cancers including prostate cancer, whereas its expression was not affected in precancerous prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia.

Here, we have investigated the functional significance of Myb in prostate cancer. Our studies demonstrate Myb expression in all prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP, C4-2, PC3 and DU145) examined, whereas it is negligibly expressed in normal/benign prostate epithelial cells (RWPE1 and RWPE2).

Using loss and gain of function approaches, we demonstrate that Myb promotes and sustains cell cycle progression and survival under androgen-supplemented and -deprived conditions, respectively, through induction of cyclins (A1, D1 and E1), Bcl-xL and Bcl2 and downregulation of p27 and Bax. Interestingly, Myb overexpression is also associated with enhanced prostate-specific antigen expression. Furthermore, our data show a role of Myb in enhanced motility and invasion and decreased homotypic interactions of prostate cancer cells.

Immunoblot analyses demonstrate gain of mesenchymal and loss of epithelial markers and vice versa, in Myb-overexpressing LNCaP and -silenced C4-2 cells, respectively, indicating a role of Myb in epithelial to mesenchymal transition.

Many studies have shown that traditional Chinese medicine exhibited antitumor responses. Quercetin, a natural polyphenolic compound, has been shown to induce apoptosis in many human cancer cell lines. Although numerous evidences show multiple possible signaling pathways of quercetin in apoptosis, there is no report to address the role of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in quercetin-induced apoptosis in PC-3 cells. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of quercetin on the induction of the apoptotic pathway in human prostate cancer PC-3 cells. Cells were treated with quercetin for 24 and 48 h and at various doses (50-200 μM), and cell morphology and viability decreased significantly in dose-dependent manners. Flow cytometric assay indicated that quercetin at 150 μM caused G0/G1 phase arrest (31.4-49.7%) and sub-G1 phase cells (19.77%) for 36 h treatment and this effect is a time-dependent manner. Western blotting analysis indicated that quercetin induces the G0/G1 phase arrest via decreasing the levels of CDK2, cyclins E, and D proteins. Quercetin also stimulated the protein expression of ATF, GRP78, and GADD153 which is a hall marker of ER stress.

This condition is called post-TUR prostatitis or cystitis. In the present study, we noticed a similar phenomenon in five patients who underwent cholecystectomy, of whom four had gallbladder adenocarcinoma and one had metastatic liver cancer originating from the rectum. We detected necrotizing granulomas with massive eosinophil accumulation, associated with marked eosinophilia. To induce these phenomena, the interval between the first operation (i.e., cholecystectomy) and the second operation (i.e., resection of the hepatic bed and extrahepatic bile duct) is very important. If the interval was 1 week, no granuloma formation was detected. On the other hand, if it was more than 2 weeks, the resected hepatic bed contained necrotizing granulomas with substantial eosinophil accumulation combined with an increase in peripheral eosinophilia (up to 34% in one case). Secondary resection was necessary to induce eosinophilia after cholecystectomy. In this sense, malignancies possessed a relationship with delayed eosinophilia. In the granulomas, some foreign body-type multinucleated giant cells were positive for both anti-interleukin (IL)-5 and CD68 antibodies. In sharp contrast, no eosinophilia was detected after cholecystectomy, with or without hepatic resection consequent to severe adhesion. Clinicians as well as pathologists should keep in mind that these peculiar phenomena of eosinophil accumulation surrounding the necrotizing granulomas and peripheral eosinophilia after cholecystectomy could occur.""","""['Yuji Ohtsuki', 'Masashi Kimura', 'Ryohei Watanabe', 'Yuhei Okada', 'Yuki Teratani', 'Atsushi Kurabayashi', 'Tamotsu Takeuchi', 'Gang-Hong Lee', 'Mutsuo Furihata']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Med Mol Morphol""","""['Eosinophil infiltration in post-transurethral resection prostatitis and cystitis with special reference to sequential changes of eosinophilia.', 'Do hepatic-sided tumors require more extensive resection than peritoneal-sided tumors in patients with T2 gallbladder cancer?

In this study, we studied the molecular mechanisms of hormonal therapy by comparing the effect of bicalutamide (anti-androgen), goserelin (GnRH agonist) and no therapy, followed by radical prostatectomy. For this purpose, 28 men were randomly assigned to treatment groups. Freshly frozen specimens were used for gene expression profiling for all known protein-coding genes. An in silico Bayesian modelling tool was used to assess cancer-specific gene expression from heterogeneous tissue specimens. The expression of 128 genes was > two-fold reduced by the treatments. Only 16% of the altered genes were common in both treatment groups. Of the 128 genes, only 24 were directly androgen-regulated genes, according to re-analysis of previous data on gene expression, androgen receptor-binding sites and histone modifications in prostate cancer cell line models. The tumours containing TMPRSS2-ERG fusion showed higher gene expression of genes related to proliferation compared to the fusion-negative tumours in untreated cases. Interestingly, endocrine therapy reduced the expression of one-half of these genes and thus diminished the differences between the fusion-positive and -negative samples.

In this study, we assessed the role of serum sarcosine as a biomarker for PCa, as well as any association between sarcosine levels and clinical-pathological parameters.  Methods:   Sarcosine was measured by fluorometric assay in serum samples from 290 PCa patients and 312 patients with no evidence of malignancy (NEM), confirmed by 8-12 core prostate biopsies. Nonparametric statistical tests and receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analyses were performed to assess the diagnostic performance of sarcosine in different (prostate-specific antigen) PSA ranges.  Results:   ROC analyses in subjects with PSA < 4 ng/ml showed a higher predictive value of sarcosine (AUC = 0.668) versus total PSA (AUC = 0.535) (P = 0.03), whereas for the other two PSA ranges (4-10 ng/ml and >10 ng/ml), percent ratio of free to total PSA (%fPSA) showed a predictive superiority over sarcosine. Moreover, in patients with a PSA < 4 ng/ml, the percentage of low/intermediate-grade cancers was positively associated with sarcosine levels (P = 0.005). The specificities for serum sarcosine, %fPSA, PSA, and the logistic regression model at 95% sensitivity were 24.4, 3.41, 2.22, and 28.4%, respectively.  Conclusions:   We provide evidence that serum sarcosine has a higher predictive value than tPSA and %fPSA in patients with PSA < 4 ng/ml. Moreover, sarcosine levels were significantly different in low grade versus high grade cancers in this subset of patients, suggesting that this marker may be a further tool not only for diagnosing PCa in normal PSA and abnormal DRE/TRUS patients but also for selecting candidates for non-aggressive therapies and active surveillance.""","""['Giuseppe Lucarelli', 'Margherita Fanelli', 'Angela Maria Vittoria Larocca', 'Cinzia Annatea Germinario', 'Monica Rutigliano', 'Antonio Vavallo', 'Francesco Paolo Selvaggi', 'Carlo Bettocchi', 'Michele Battaglia', 'Pasquale Ditonno']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Sarcosine, a biomarker for prostate cancer: ready for prime time?', 'Spondin-2, a secreted extracellular matrix protein, is a novel diagnostic biomarker for prostate cancer.', 'Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) isoform p2PSA significantly improves the prediction of prostate cancer at initial extended prostate biopsies in patients with total PSA between 2.0 and 10 ng/ml: results of a prospective study in a clinical setting.', 'Electrophoretic subforms of free prostate-specific antigen in serum as promising diagnostic tool in prostate cancer diagnostics.', 'Selective application of tumor markers PSA.', 'Diagnostic tests in urology: percentage of free prostate-specific antigen (PSA).', 'Radiogenomics in Renal Cancer Management-Current Evidence and Future Prospects.', 'Mechanisms of Prostate Cancer Cells Survival and Their Therapeutic Targeting.', 'Emerging Hallmarks of Metabolic Reprogramming in Prostate Cancer.', 'MUC1 Tissue Expression and Its Soluble Form CA15-3 Identify a Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma with Distinct Metabolic Profile and Poor Clinical Outcome.', 'Circulating metabolite biomarkers: a game changer in the human prostate cancer diagnosis.']"""

We hypothesize that factors stimulating the activity of PSA could be used to reduce prostate tumor growth. Using phage display, we have developed peptides C4 and B2 that stimulate the enzymatic activity of PSA. Our aim was to study whether these peptides enhance the antiangiogenic activity of PSA.  Methods:   We used an in vitro angiogenesis assay where human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) form tubular networks when they are grown on Matrigel. Proteolytically active PSA and peptides that stimulate the activity of PSA were added to the cells. Endothelial cell tube formation was quantified and expressed as an angiogenesis index.  Results:   PSA reduced the angiogenesis index to ∼50% of controls both in serum-containing and serum-free medium. The addition of peptide C4 or B2 together with PSA caused a significant further decrease in angiogenesis index to ∼70% of that caused by PSA alone. A similar decrease in angiogenesis index was observed when PSA concentration was increased 2.4-fold of that used with peptides.  Conclusions:   The inhibitory effect of PSA on tube formation can be enhanced by the addition of peptides that stimulate the activity of PSA.

Recent studies have demonstrated that an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) has the potential to decrease serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level and improve performance status in CRPC patients. These facts prompted us to investigate the direct effects of ARBs on prostate cancer growth and progression.  Methods:   Transgenic rat for adenocarcinoma of prostate (TRAP) model established in our laboratory was used. TRAP rats of 3 weeks of age received ARB (telmisartan or candesartan) at the concentration of 2 or 10 mg/kg/day in drinking water for 12 weeks. In vitro analyses for cell growth, ubiquitylation or reporter gene assay were performed using LNCaP cells.  Results:   We found that both telmisartan and candesartan attenuated prostate carcinogenesis in TRAP rats by augmentation of apoptosis resulting from activation of caspases, inactivation of p38 MAPK and down-regulation of the androgen receptor (AR). Further, microarray analysis demonstrated up-regulation of estrogen receptor β (ERβ) by ARB treatment. In both parental and androgen-independent LNCaP cells, ARB inhibited both cell growth and AR-mediated transcriptional activity. ARB also exerted a mild additional effect on AR-mediated transcriptional activation by the ERβ up-regulation. An intervention study revealed that PSA progression was prolonged in prostate cancer patients given an ARB compared with placebo control.

Recently, accumulating evidence indicates that cancer cells, as well as some normal cells can secret IgG. This study was designed to evaluate IgG gene expression and its possible significance in PCa tissue samples and cell lines.  Methods:   IgG expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, immunofluorescence, RT-PCR, and Western blot. The possible significance of IgG was evaluated on tissue array and cell lines. To assess cell viability and proliferation, MTS assay was carried out. Apoptosis was evaluated with propidium iodide and annexin-V staining.  Results:   Expressions of IgG and its related genes were detected in cell lines. Abundant gene expressions of Igγ and Igκ chain were detected in PCa tissue samples, but not in normal prostate tissues. In addition, IgG expression was significantly higher in PCa tissues than in the benign prostate hyperplasia tissues (P < 0.001). Igγ expression was positively correlated to Gleason score and histological grade (P < 0.05). Furthermore, in vitro experiments showed that anti-human monoclonal IgG antibody suppressed cell proliferation and increased apoptosis in cultured PCa cells.  Conclusion:   IgG gene expression in PCa is related to cell differentiation and clinical status. PCa cell produced IgG is involved in the biological behavior of this cancer and may serve as a useful marker for cancer cell differentiation and prognosis.

Treatment options in the UK for men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) have been limited, and there is no standard approach, particularly in the second-line setting. The absence of a standard approach is further confounded by the differing definitions and terminologies still used in clinical practice to describe this group of patients (e.g. androgen-independent prostate cancer, hormone refractory prostate cancer, CRPC). With multiple new treatment options emerging, it will be critical to identify key considerations in our decision-making process and to establish an optimum, standardized approach to treatment so that new therapies can be assimilated into an mCRPC treatment algorithm and our routine clinical practice. Most UK oncologists consider patients with advanced, symptomatic prostate cancer as eligible for chemotherapy, although a poor performance status, significant co-morbid factors, advancing age, and the presence of asymptomatic disease with slowly rising prostate-specific antigen levels would prevent chemotherapy use. The decision to retreat with chemotherapy is largely driven by prior response to first-line chemotherapy. Many UK oncologists feel that UK clinical practice is likely to change over the next 5 years, with abiraterone acetate, MDV3100 and cabazitaxel likely to have the most positive impacts in the treatment of mCRPC.  Objectives:   To evaluate the current management of patients with advanced prostate cancer by UK oncologists. To gain insights into the future role of emerging therapies.  Materials and methods:   A semi-structured questionnaire was issued by the British Uro-oncology Group to society members during a closed meeting in September 2010. Emerging therapies evaluated were: abiraterone acetate, aflibercept, bevacizumab, cabazitaxel, custirsen, MDV3100, sipuleucel-T and zibotentan.  Results:   Eighty of 98 (82%) surveys were completed. Responders had on average 189 new referrals, and treated 126 patients with advanced prostate cancer each year. Chemotherapy was used by 86% of responders for patients with symptomatic metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), although poor performance status, advancing age and slowly rising prostate-specific antigen levels would prevent chemotherapy use. The decision to retreat with chemotherapy was largely driven by prior response to first-line chemotherapy, with docetaxel preferred for those responding. Many (78%) felt that UK clinical practice was likely to change over the next 5 years, and that abiraterone acetate, MDV3100 and cabazitaxel would have the most positive impact. Opinions regarding the future use of aflibercept and custirsen were mixed. Few (≤3%) would use zibotentan or bevacizumab in the future based on recent negative phase III study results, or because of cost and complexity for sipuleucel-T.  Conclusions:   Although emerging therapies for mCRPC mean that the future is bright, guidelines are needed to ensure optimum use and sequencing of treatments.

What's known on the subject? and What does the study add? Accumulating evidence suggests that inflammation may contribute to the development of BPH and LUTS. Therefore, it is plausible that anti-inflammatory agents, such as aspirin and other NSAIDs, may reduce the risk of BPH/LUTS, as was observed in a recent analysis of daily aspirin use and BPH/LUTS risk in the Olmsted County Study of Urinary Symptoms and Health Status in Men. The present study, conducted in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial, found no association for recent aspirin or ibuprofen use with the risk of BPH/LUTS.  Objective:   To investigate the relationship between non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use and the incidence of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)-related outcomes and nocturia, a lower urinary tract symptom (LUTS) of BPH, in light of accumulating evidence suggesting a role for inflammation in BPH/LUTS development.  Patients and methods:   At baseline, participants in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial completed questions on recent, regular aspirin and ibuprofen use, BPH surgery, diagnosis of an enlarged prostate/BPH, and nocturia. Participants in the intervention arm also underwent a digital rectal examination (DRE), from which prostate dimensions were estimated, as well as a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test. Only participants in the intervention arm without BPH/LUTS at baseline were included in the analysis (n= 4771). • During follow-up, participants underwent annual DREs and PSA tests, provided annual information on finasteride use, and completed a supplemental questionnaire in 2006-2008 that included additional questions on diagnosis of an enlarged prostate/BPH and nocturia. • Information collected was used to investigate regular aspirin or ibuprofen use in relation to the incidence of six BPH/LUTS definitions: diagnosis of an enlarged prostate/BPH, nocturia (waking two or more times per night to urinate), finasteride use, any self-reported BPH/LUTS, prostate enlargement (estimated prostate volume ≥30 mL on any follow-up DRE) and elevation in PSA level (>1.4 ng/mL on any follow-up PSA test).  Results:   Generally, null results were observed for any recent, regular aspirin or ibuprofen use (risk ratio = 0.92-1.21, P= 0.043-0.91) and frequency of use (risk ratios for one category increase in NSAID use = 0.98-1.11, P-trends = 0.10-0.99) with incident BPH/LUTS.

Here, we report that CHIP, the chaperone-associated E3 ligase, induces ubiquitination and regulates the proteasomal turnover of PTEN. It was apparent from our findings that PTEN transiently associates with the molecular chaperones and thereby gets diverted to the degradation pathway through its interaction with CHIP. The TPR domain of CHIP and parts of the N-terminal domain of PTEN are required for their interaction. Overexpression of CHIP leads to elevated ubiquitination and a shortened half-life of endogenous PTEN. On the other hand, depletion of endogenous CHIP stabilizes PTEN.

In the bladder and prostate, basal epithelial and stromal cells appear similar in cytomorphology and share several cell surface markers. Their total gene expression (transcriptome) should provide a clear measure of the extent to which they are alike functionally. Since urologic stromal cells are known to mediate organ-specific tissue formation, these cells in cancers might exhibit aberrant gene expression affecting their function. For transcriptomes, cluster designation (CD) antigens have been identified for cell sorting. The sorted cell populations can be analyzed by DNA microarrays. Various bladder cell types have unique complements of CD molecules. CD9(+) urothelial, CD104(+) basal and CD13(+) stromal cells of the lamina propria were therefore analyzed, as were CD9(+) cancer and CD13(+) cancer-associated stromal cells. The transcriptome datasets were compared by principal components analysis for relatedness between cell types; those with similarity in gene expression indicated similar function. Although bladder and prostate basal cells shared CD markers such as CD104, CD44 and CD49f, they differed in overall gene expression. Basal cells also lacked stem cell gene expression.

Methods:   TNF-α-mediated migration and invasion of PC3 cells was examined using migration and invasion assays, respectively. NF-κB transcriptional activity and nuclear translocation were analyzed with luciferase reporter gene assays, immunofluorescence assays and Western blots. The ability of p65 to bind the promoter of Snail, an important mesenchymal molecular marker, was detected using a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay. After treatment with Snail-specific siRNA, the expression of invasiveness-associated genes was measured using quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot.  Results:   GA significantly inhibited the viability of PC3 cells at 1-5 μmol/L, but did not produce cytotoxic effect at the concentrations below 0.5 μmol/L. GA (0.125-0.5 μmol/L) dose-dependently inhibited the migration and invasion of PC3 cells induced by TNF-α (10 ng/mL). Moreover, the TNF-α-mediated activation of phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/Akt) and NF-κB pathways was suppressed by GA (0.5 μmol/L). Furthermore, this anti-invasion effect of GA was associated with regulation of Snail. Snail expression was significantly down-regulated by treatment with GA (0.5 μmol/L) in the TNF-α-stimulated PC3 cells.

AR expression is maintained throughout the progression of prostate cancer and is also associated with an aggressive, castration-resistant (CR) phenotype. Despite the critical roles of AR expression in prostate cancer progression, the exact signaling mechanism regulating AR expression remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrated that AR expression was increased by a low-affinity leukotriene B(4) receptor (BLT2)-linked pathway. We found that BLT2 was overexpressed in AR-positive prostate cancer cells, such as LNCaP cells, and BLT2 inhibition, using an inhibitor or siRNA knockdown, clearly attenuated AR expression and triggered apoptosis in these cells. These results suggest a role for BLT2 in AR expression and the survival of AR-positive prostate cancer cells. Moreover, we found that the NADPH oxidase family protein, Nox4, lay downstream of BLT2 and mediated the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and subsequent NF-κB stimulation, thereby inducing AR expression. Taken together, our results demonstrate that BLT2 plays a critical role in AR expression via a Nox4-ROS-NF-κB-linked pathway, thereby mediating the survival of AR-positive prostate cancer cells.

The anti-proliferation effect of Rg3 on prostate cancer cells has been well reported. To test whether Rg3 has an anti-metastatic effect on prostate cancer, we treated a highly metastatic PC-3M prostate cancer cell line with Rg3. We found that Rg3 (10μM) led to remarkable inhibition of PC-3M cell migration. Simultaneously, exposure to Rg3 suppressed expression of the aquaporin 1 (AQP1) water channel protein, which has previously been reported to be involved in cell migration. Overexpression of AQP1 attenuated Rg3-induced inhibition of cell migration, and introduction of a shRNA targeting AQP1 abrogated the inhibitory effect of Rg3, although the basal level of cell migration was decreased by RNA interference. In mechanism study, estrogen receptor- and glucocorticoid receptor-dependent pathways are proved uninvolved in the AQP1 regulation by Rg3. However, Rg3 treatment triggered the activation of p38 MAPK; and SB202190, a specific inhibitor of p38 MAPK, antagonized the Rg3-induced regulation of AQP1 and cell migration, suggesting a crucial role for p38 in the regulation process. Deletion analysis of the promoter region of AQP1 was also conducted using dual-luciferase assay, which indicated that the -1000 bp to -200 bp promoter region was involved in the AQP1 regulation by Rg3. In all, we conclude that Rg3 effectively suppresses migration of PC-3M cells by down-regulating AQP1 expression through p38 MAPK pathway and some transcription factors acting on the AQP1 promoter.""","""['Xue-Yang Pan', 'Hao Guo', 'Jing Han', 'Feng Hao', 'Yu An', 'Yan Xu', 'Yilixiati Xiaokaiti', 'Yan Pan', 'Xue-Jun Li']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Eur J Pharmacol""","""['Hypoxia-induced up-regulation of aquaporin-1 protein in prostate cancer cells in a p38-dependent manner.', 'Stereospecific effects of ginsenoside 20-Rg3 inhibits TGF-β1-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition and suppresses lung cancer migration, invasion and anoikis resistance.', 'Ginsenoside Rg3 inhibits cell growth, migration and invasion in Caco-2 cells by downregulation of lncRNA CCAT1.', 'Anticancer effects of ginsenoside Rg3 (Review).', 'Role of Aquaporin 1 Signalling in Cancer Development and Progression.', 'Water channel protein AQP1 in cytoplasm is a critical factor in breast cancer local invasion.', 'Aquaporin-mediated dysregulation of cell migration in disease states.', 'Aquaporins as Prognostic Biomarker in Prostate Cancer.', 'Phytochemicals in Inhibition of Prostate Cancer: Evidence from Molecular Mechanisms Studies.', 'A cyclodextrin-based nanoformulation achieves co-delivery of ginsenoside Rg3 and quercetin for chemo-immunotherapy in colorectal cancer.']"""

Two histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDAC), suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) and trichostatin A (TSA) induced histone acetylation of the DLC1 promoter in all three lines. DLC1 promoter methylation and deacetylation were detected in LNCaP and C4-2B-2 cells while in 22Rv1 cells DLC1 is silenced by deacetylation. Treatment with SAHA or TSA efficiently increased DLC1 expression in all lines, particularly in 22Rv1 cells, and activated the DLC1 promoter through the same Sp1 sites. The 22Rv1 cell line was selected to evaluate the efficacy of combined DLC1 transduction and SAHA treatment on tumor growth in athymic mice. Individually, DLC1 transduction and SAHA exposure reduced the tumor size by 75-80% compared to controls and in combination almost completely inhibited tumor growth. The antitumor effect was associated with the induction of apoptosis and inhibition of RhoA activity. SAHA alone significantly reduced RhoA activity, showing that this RhoGTPase is a target for SAHA.

Use of CAD holds promise to enable new levels of decision support and allow for additional layers of quality assurance and consistency in rendered diagnoses. However, the development and testing of prostate cancer CAD solutions requires a ground truth map of the cancer to enable the generation of receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves. This requires a pathologist to annotate, or paint, each of the malignant glands in prostate cancer with an image editor software - a time consuming and exhaustive process. Recently, two CAD algorithms have been described: probabilistic pairwise Markov models (PPMM) and spatially-invariant vector quantization (SIVQ). Briefly, SIVQ operates as a highly sensitive and specific pattern matching algorithm, making it optimal for the identification of any epithelial morphology, whereas PPMM operates as a highly sensitive detector of malignant perturbations in glandular lumenal architecture.  Methods:   By recapitulating algorithmically how a pathologist reviews prostate tissue sections, we created an algorithmic cascade of PPMM and SIVQ algorithms as previously described by Doyle el al. [1] where PPMM identifies the glands with abnormal lumenal architecture, and this area is then screened by SIVQ to identify the epithelium.  Results:   The performance of this algorithm cascade was assessed qualitatively (with the use of heatmaps) and quantitatively (with the use of ROC curves) and demonstrates greater performance in the identification of malignant prostatic epithelium.  Conclusion:   This ability to semi-autonomously paint nearly all the malignant epithelium of prostate cancer has immediate applications to future prostate cancer CAD development as a validated ground truth generator. In addition, such an approach has potential applications as a pre-screening/quality assurance tool.""","""['Jason Hipp', 'James Monaco', 'L Priya Kunju', 'Jerome Cheng', 'Yukako Yagi', 'Jaime Rodriguez-Canales', 'Michael R Emmert-Buck', 'Stephen Hewitt', 'Michael D Feldman', 'John E Tomaszewski', 'Mehmet Toner', 'Ronald G Tompkins', 'Thomas Flotte', 'David Lucas', 'John R Gilbertson', 'Anant Madabhushi', 'Ulysses Balis']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Anal Cell Pathol (Amst)""","""['Optimization of complex cancer morphology detection using the SIVQ pattern recognition algorithm.', 'Automated vector selection of SIVQ and parallel computing integration MATLAB™: Innovations supporting large-scale and high-throughput image analysis studies.', 'High-throughput detection of prostate cancer in histological sections using probabilistic pairwise Markov models.', 'Spatially Invariant Vector Quantization: A pattern matching algorithm for multiple classes of image subject matter including pathology.', 'Computer technology in detection and staging of prostate carcinoma: a review.', 'Computer-Aided Laser Dissection: A Microdissection Workflow Leveraging Image Analysis Tools.', 'Evaluating stability of histomorphometric features across scanner and staining variations: prostate cancer diagnosis from whole slide images.', 'Diagnostic assessment of osteosarcoma chemoresistance based on Virtual Clinical Trials.', 'SIVQ-LCM protocol for the ArcturusXT instrument.', 'Image microarrays derived from tissue microarrays (IMA-TMA): New resource for computer-aided diagnostic algorithm development.']"""

Additionally, while learning curve studies often define volume thresholds for improvement, few of these studies demonstrate specific technical modifications that allow reproducibility of improved outcomes.  Objective:   Demonstrate and quantify the learning curve for improving sexual function outcomes based on technical refinements that reduce neurovascular bundle displacement during nerve-sparing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP).  Design, setting, and participants:   We performed a retrospective study of 400 consecutive RARPs, categorized into groups of 50, performed after elimination of continuous surgeon/assistant neurovascular bundle countertraction.  Surgical procedure:   Our approach to RARP has been described previously. A single-console robotic system was used for all cases.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite sexual function was measured within 1 yr of RARP. Linear regression was performed to determine factors influencing the recovery of sexual function.  Results and limitations:   Greater surgeon experience was associated with better 5-mo sexual function (p = 0.007) and a trend for better 12-mo sexual function (p = 0.061), with improvement plateauing after 250-300 cases. Additionally, younger patient age (both p<0.02) and better preoperative sexual function (<0.001) were associated with better 5- and 12-mo sexual function. Moreover, trainee robotic console time during nerve sparing was associated with worse 12-mo sexual function (p=0.021), while unilateral nerve sparing/non-nerve sparing was associated with worse 5-mo sexual function (p = 0.009). Limitations include the retrospective single-surgeon design.  Conclusions:   With greater surgeon experience, attenuating lateral displacement of the neurovascular bundle and resultant neurapraxia improve postoperative sexual function.

Materials and methods:   Medical records of patients undergoing robotic laparoendoscopic single site procedures between May 2008 and December 2010 were analyzed. The da Vinci® S or Si systems and 3 different multichannel single port devices were used. Demographic, intraoperative and postoperative data were assessed.  Results:   Overall, 50 patients were scheduled to undergo robotic laparoendoscopic single site urological surgery during the study period, representing 36% of the total patients undergoing laparoendoscopic single site surgery at our institution. Mean ± SD patient age was 60.2 ± 13.6 years. Mean body mass index was 27.0 ± 4.5 kg/m(2). Specifically, 24 patients underwent robotic laparoendoscopic single site renal surgery and the same method was used in 26 patients undergoing pelvic surgery. Mean operative time was 207 ± 74 minutes and mean estimated blood loss was 140 ± 111 ml. Four cases were converted to laparoscopy (2 standard, 2 robotic assisted) and 6 cases required at least 1 additional trocar outside of the single site incision.

Both methods aim at reducing serum testosterone concentrations to a castrate level which is currently defined as less than 50 ng/dl. The results of previous studies are based on testosterone immunoassays that have insufficient accuracy in the low range. In this study we reevaluated serum testosterone concentrations in men on androgen deprivation therapy using isotope dilution-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, an accurate method of measuring testosterone in the castrate range.  Materials and methods:   Subjects underwent surgical castration (34) or received a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist (32). Serum samples were obtained more than 3 months after surgery or initiation of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist therapy. Testosterone levels were determined using isotope dilution-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Dihydroepiandrosterone sulfate, androstenedione, sex hormone-binding globulin and inhibin B levels were determined.  Results:   All subjects had serum testosterone values less than 50 ng/dl and 97% had testosterone concentrations less than 20 ng/dl. Medically castrated men had significantly lower testosterone levels (median 4.0 ng/dl, range less than 2.9 to 20.2) than those surgically castrated (median 9.2 ng/dl, range less than 2.9 to 28.8, p <0.001). No difference was found in dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, androstenedione and sex hormone-binding globulin levels between the groups, whereas inhibin B levels were significantly higher in the luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist treated group.  Conclusions:   Using an accurate technique for testosterone measurement, subjects on luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist therapy had significantly lower testosterone concentrations than men who underwent surgical castration.

We also examined the relationship between other clinical parameters and the change in prostate specific antigen doubling time.  Materials and methods:   We retrospectively reviewed the prostate cancer database from 1989 to 2008 to identify patients treated with radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer who experienced prostate specific antigen recurrence. Of the 2,237 patients identified 329 had biochemical recurrence. Prostate specific antigen doubling time was calculated at each visit and linear regression of prostate specific antigen doubling time with time was fit. Rate of change in prostate specific antigen doubling time was defined as the slope of the least squares regression line.  Results:   Median followup was 5 years (range 0.2 to 18). High Gleason score and local recurrence within 5 years were significantly associated with shorter 2-year prostate specific antigen doubling time and a decreased rate of change in doubling time (p = 0.0096, 0.0119, 0.0195 and 0.0258, respectively). Metastasis within 5 years was significantly associated with shorter 2 and 5-year doubling time (p = 0.0006 and 0.0014, respectively). Using all prostate specific antigen values within 5 years of initial biochemical recurrence yielded an overall median prostate specific antigen doubling time of 52.8 months (range 5.4 to 100.0). The median rate of change in doubling time was -1.05 (range -64.7 to 27.0). Median time to metastasis after biochemical recurrence was 12.9 years.  Conclusions:   Median prostate specific antigen doubling time decreases with time.

We objectively compared the resection speed of contemporary holmium laser enucleation vs transurethral resection of the prostate and of holmium laser enucleation vs simple open prostatectomy.  Materials and methods:   The study cohort consisted of 100 cases of transurethral prostate resection and 60 of simple open prostatectomy from our previous randomized, controlled trials. These cases were subjected to matched pair analysis with greater than 1,000 from our prospective contemporary database on holmium laser prostate enucleation. Exact matches were made for the same amount of resected tissue. In all contemporary holmium laser enucleation cases a mechanical soft tissue morcellator was used. We calculated and compared the specific resection speed in gm per minute and operative time for the same amount of resected tissue.  Results:   In groups 1 and 2 we matched 99 exact laser enucleation-transurethral resection pairs and 53 exact laser enucleation-simple open prostatectomy pairs, respectively. Resection speed and operative time for laser enucleation were statistically significantly faster than for resection (0.61 vs 0.51 gm per minute and 62 vs 73 minutes, p <0.01) and similar to those of simple open prostatectomy (0.92 vs 1.0 gm per minute and 101 vs 90 minutes, respectively, p ≥0.21).

However, little is known about the characteristics associated with the increased probability of progression in patients on active surveillance. We analyzed our active surveillance cohort in search of such features.  Materials and methods:   A total of 272 men with prostate cancer have enrolled in our active surveillance program since 1994, of whom 249 underwent at least 1 surveillance biopsy and were included in analysis. Our active surveillance inclusion criteria are biopsy Gleason grade less than 7, 2 or fewer positive biopsy cores, 20% or less tumor in any core and clinical stage T1-T2a. Changes in any of these parameters during followup that went beyond these limits were considered progression. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis was done to determine patient characteristics associated with an increased risk of progression.  Results:   A total of 64 patients (26%) showed progression at a median 2.9-year followup on a mean of 2.3 surveillance biopsies. The progression risk was significantly increased in black patients (adjusted HR 3.87-4.12), and in men with a smaller prostate and higher prostate specific antigen density. The latter 2 variables had no specific cutoff for an association with progression.  Conclusions:   Black men with low risk prostate cancer should be advised that the risk of progression on active surveillance may be higher than that in the available literature.

We examined the proportion and outcomes of men 65 years old or older with low risk disease who underwent radical prostatectomy at our institution.  Materials and methods:   Our institutional radical prostatectomy database with more than 19,000 patients was queried for men 65 years old or older with low risk prostate cancer. Pathological and survival outcomes were assessed. Subanalysis was done on men 70 years old or older to determine whether outcomes among older men differed by age.  Results:   A total of 1,560 men (8.1%) 65 years old or older with low risk prostate cancer underwent radical prostatectomy between 1983 and 2010. After radical prostatectomy 38.3% of the men had evidence of more aggressive cancer, including Gleason score 7 or greater, or extraprostatic extension. After radical prostatectomy actuarial 5, 10 and 15-year biochemical recurrence-free survival was 93.2%, 89.2% and 82.2%, prostate cancer specific survival was 99.7%, 98.4% and 97.2%, and overall survival was 96.1%, 83.5% and 60.2%, respectively.

In this study we determined the incidence of pathology (benign and malignant) in patients with visible hematuria and those with persistent and recurrent visible hematuria, and evaluated the policy for investigations.  Materials and methods:   Data were prospectively collected for 1,804 patients with visible hematuria at a United Kingdom teaching hospital from January 1999 to September 2007. In October 2010 the comprehensive hospital electronic database was checked for every individual patient to ensure no urological pathology was missed. All patients underwent standard hematuria investigations, including renal tract ultrasound and excretory urography or contrast enhanced computer tomography urogram, flexible cystoscopy and urine cytology.  Results:   The male-to-female ratio was 4.8:1. Median age ± SD was 67 ± 17.0 years (range 21 to 109). Median followup was 6.6 ± 2.5 years (range 1.5 to 11.6). No urological pathology was found in 965 (53.5%) patients. Malignant urological disease was found in 386 (21.4%) patients, of whom 329 had bladder tumors.

Of these patients 35 received a significant urological diagnosis, including 12 (17.4%) urological malignancies, while 34 (49.3%) still had no diagnosis. Limitations include the possibility of missing pathology.  Conclusions:   Almost 50% of patients presenting with visible hematuria will have a diagnosis.

This scheme is predominantly based on the textural appearance of aberrant glandular structures. Gleason grade is difficult to standardize and often leads to discussion due to interrater and intrarater disagreement. Thus, we investigated whether digital image based automated quantitative histomorphometry could be used to achieve a more standardized, reproducible classification outcome.  Materials and methods:   In a proof of principle study we developed a method to evaluate digitized histological images of single prostate cancer regions in hematoxylin and eosin stained sections. Preprocessed color images were subjected to color deconvolution, followed by the binarization of obtained hematoxylin related image channels. Highlighted neoplastic epithelial gland related objects were morphometrically assessed by a classifier based on 2 calculated quantitative and objective geometric measures, that is inverse solidity and inverse compactness. The procedure was then applied to the prostate cancer probes of 125 patients. Each probe was independently classified for Gleason grade 3, 4 or 5 by an experienced pathologist blinded to image analysis outcome.  Results:   Together inverse compactness and inverse solidity were adequate discriminatory features for a powerful classifier that distinguished Gleason grade 3 from grade 4/5 histology. The classifier was robust on sensitivity analysis.  Conclusions:   Results suggest that quantitative and interpretable measures can be obtained from image based analysis, permitting algorithmic differentiation of prostate Gleason grades. The method must be validated in a large independent series of specimens.""","""['Markus Loeffler', 'Lars Greulich', 'Patrick Scheibe', 'Philip Kahl', 'David Adler', 'Ulf-Dietrich Braumann', 'Jens-Peer Kuska', 'Nicolas Wernert']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Automated gleason grading on prostate biopsy slides by statistical representations of homology profile.', 'Comparison of Artificial Intelligence Techniques to Evaluate Performance of a Classifier for Automatic Grading of Prostate Cancer From Digitized Histopathologic Images.', 'Automated approach for estimation of grade groups for prostate cancer based on histological image feature analysis.', 'The 2014 International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) Consensus Conference on Gleason Grading of Prostatic Carcinoma: Definition of Grading Patterns and Proposal for a New Grading System.', 'Contemporary Gleason Grading of Prostatic Carcinoma: An Update With Discussion on Practical Issues to Implement the 2014 International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) Consensus Conference on Gleason Grading of Prostatic Carcinoma.', 'The Quantitative Criteria Based on the Fractal Dimensions, Entropy, and Lacunarity for the Spatial Distribution of Cancer Cell Nuclei Enable Identification of Low or High Aggressive Prostate Carcinomas.', 'Identifying in vivo DCE MRI markers associated with microvessel architecture and gleason grades of prostate cancer.', 'Fractal geometry in the objective grading of prostate carcinoma.', 'Objective grading of prostate carcinoma based on fractal dimensions: Gleason 3 + 4= 7a ≠ Gleason 4 + 3 =7b.']"""

Objective:   We present contemporary variations in PCa incidence and mortality patterns across five continents using the most recent data from the International Agency for Research on Cancer.  Evidence acquisition:   PCa incidence and mortality estimates for 2008 from GLOBOCAN are presented. We also examine recent trends in PCa incidence rates for 40 countries and mortality rates for 53 countries from 1985 and onward via join-point analyses using an augmented version of Cancer Incidence in Five Continents and the World Health Organization mortality database.  Evidence synthesis:   Estimated PCa incidence rates remain most elevated in the highest resource counties worldwide including North America, Oceania, and western and northern Europe. Mortality rates tend to be higher in less developed regions of the world including parts of South America, the Caribbean, and sub-Saharan Africa. Increasing PCa incidence rates during the most recent decade were observed in 32 of the 40 countries examined, whereas trends tended to stabilize in 8 countries. In contrast, PCa mortality rates decreased in 27 of the 53 countries under study, whereas rates increased in 16 and remained stable in 10 countries.  Conclusions:   PCa incidence rates increased in nearly all countries considered in this analysis except in a few high-income countries. In contrast, the increase in PCa mortality rates mainly occurred in lower resource settings, with declines largely confined to high-resource countries.""","""['Melissa M Center', 'Ahmedin Jemal', 'Joannie Lortet-Tieulent', 'Elizabeth Ward', 'Jacques Ferlay', 'Otis Brawley', 'Freddie Bray']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Prostate cancer epidemic in sight?', 'Words of Wisdom: re: international variation in prostate cancer incidence and mortality rates.', 'International variations in bladder cancer incidence and mortality.', 'Recent Global Patterns in Prostate Cancer Incidence and Mortality Rates.', 'Global Incidence and Mortality for Prostate Cancer: Analysis of Temporal Patterns and Trends in 36 Countries.', 'International variations and trends in testicular cancer incidence and mortality.', 'Worldwide variations in colorectal cancer.', 'Resource use in the last year of life of prostate cancer patients-A register-based analysis.', 'Predictors of Prostate Cancer at Fusion Biopsy: The Role of Positive Family History, Hypertension, Diabetes, and Body Mass Index.', 'Correlations of PTEN and ERG Immunoexpression in Prostate Carcinoma and Lesions Related to Its Natural History: Clinical Perspectives.', 'Association Between Statin Exposure and Incidence and Prognosis of Prostate Cancer: A Meta-analysis Based on Observational Studies.', 'A retrospective study on the incidence, management and risk factors of skin rash in patients with advanced prostate cancer in Japan.']"""

While cancer of the lung, breast, colorectum, stomach and prostate are the most common types of cancer globally, in east and southern Africa these are less common and comprehensive data to inform policies are lacking.  Methods:   Nationwide cancer registry was conducted between September and October 2010 in Malawi. New cancer cases registered from 2007 to 2010 were identified from hospital and clinic registers of 81 out of 84 health facilities providing cancer diagnosis, treatment or palliative care services. Demographic and cancer data were extracted from registers and case notes using a standard form.  Results:   A total of 18,946 new cases of cancer were registered in Malawi from 2007-2010. Of these 55.9% were females, 7.2% were children aged less than 15 years, 76.5% were adults aged 15-59 years and 16.4% were elderly aged 60 years or more. Only 17.9% of the cases had histologically verified diagnosis, 33.2% were diagnosed clinically and 49.6% based on clinical and some investigations. Amongst females, cancer of the cervix was the commonest accounting for 45.4% of all cases followed by Kaposi sarcoma (21.1%), cancer of the oesophagus (8.2%), breast (4.6%) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (4.1%). In males, Kaposi sarcoma was the most frequent (50.7%) then cancer of oesophagus (16.9%), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (7.8), prostate (4.0%) and urinary bladder (3.7%). Age-standardised incidence rate per 100,000 population for all types of cancer in males increased from 31 in 1999-2002 to 56 in 2007-2010. In females it increased from 29 to 69. Kaposi sarcoma and cancer of the oesophagus, cervical cancer and Kaposi sarcoma were the main causes for the increased incidence in males and females respectively. It was estimated that, annually at least 8,151 new cases of cancer (all types) occur in Malawi.  Conclusions:   This study provided data on common types and trends of cancer that could be used to focus prevention, treatment and control interventions in the context of limited resources.

Few studies have examined the involvement of NFκB and inflammatory signalling in PCa.Immunohistochemistry was employed to investigate the expression of NFκB/p65, C-reactive protein and Ki67 in 61 clinical samples. Tumours expressing high levels of p65 (p=0.004), CRP (p=0.011) and Ki67 (p=0.0003) had a shorter disease specific survival. Upon combining p65 and CRP status it was observed that those tumours with low expression of both proteins had a median survival of 11 years compared to 3.9 years for those with tumours with high expression of both (p=0.005). CRP expression was significantly higher in the 21 patients who died of their disease and on multivariate analysis CRP expression retained independent significance (p=0.005).

Recent studies have shown that deregulated expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) contributes to the initiation and progression of PCa. Among several known miRNAs, let-7 family appears to play a key role in the recurrence and progression of PCa by regulating CSCs; however, the mechanism by which let-7 family contributes to PCa aggressiveness is unclear. Enhancer of Zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), a putative target of let-7 family, was demonstrated to control stem cell function. In this study, we found loss of let-7 family with corresponding over-expression of EZH2 in human PCa tissue specimens, especially in higher Gleason grade tumors. Overexpression of let-7 by transfection of let-7 precursors decreased EZH2 expression and repressed clonogenic ability and sphere-forming capacity of PCa cells, which was consistent with inhibition of EZH2 3'UTR luciferase activity. We also found that the treatment of PCa cells with BR-DIM (formulated DIM: 3,3'-diindolylmethane by Bio Response, Boulder, CO, abbreviated as BR-DIM) up-regulated let-7 and down-regulated EZH2 expression, consistent with inhibition of self-renewal and clonogenic capacity. Moreover, BR-DIM intervention in our on-going phase II clinical trial in patients prior to radical prostatectomy showed upregulation of let-7 consistent with down-regulation of EZH2 expression in PCa tissue specimens after BR-DIM intervention. These results suggest that the loss of let-7 mediated increased expression of EZH2 contributes to PCa aggressiveness, which could be attenuated by BR-DIM treatment, and thus BR-DIM is likely to have clinical impact.""","""['Dejuan Kong', 'Elisabeth Heath', 'Wei Chen', 'Michael L Cher', 'Isaac Powell', 'Lance Heilbrun', 'Yiwei Li', 'Shadan Ali', 'Seema Sethi', 'Oudai Hassan', 'Clara Hwang', 'Nilesh Gupta', 'Dhananjay Chitale', 'Wael A Sakr', 'Mani Menon', 'Fazlul H Sarkar']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Androgen receptor splice variants contribute to prostate cancer aggressiveness through induction of EMT and expression of stem cell marker genes.', 'MicroRNA-101 negatively regulates Ezh2 and its expression is modulated by androgen receptor and HIF-1alpha/HIF-1beta.', ""Role of BioResponse 3,3'-Diindolylmethane in the Treatment of Human Prostate Cancer: Clinical Experience."", 'BRCA1 and EZH2 cooperate in regulation of prostate cancer stem cell phenotype.', 'The role of EZH2 in tumour progression.', 'Synthetic Methodologies and Therapeutic Potential of Indole-3-Carbinol (I3C) and Its Derivatives.', 'State-of-the-art therapeutic strategies for targeting cancer stem cells in prostate cancer.', 'Discovery of Novel Lin28 Inhibitors to Suppress Cancer Cell Stemness.', 'MicroRNA Associated with the Invasive Phenotype in Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma: Let-7c-5p Inhibits Proliferation, Migration, and Invasion by Targeting Insulin-like Growth Factor 1 Receptor.', 'microRNA-205 in prostate cancer: Overview to clinical translation.']"""

Results:   A total of 3795 cases of SPCs were registered in the SEER between 1973 and 2006. The ratio of observed/expected number of SPCs in RCC was 1.18, which was significantly greater than expected. Solid tumors comprised 90% of all second malignancies in RCC patients, with the most second cancers reported in the prostate gland and the digestive and respiratory systems. The overall risk of second primaries was highest in patients aged over 30 years at the time of diagnosis. The site-specific risk of second cancers varied with the age at diagnosis, sex, race of the patient, size of the primary renal tumor, and history of radiation therapy. Patients with second primaries had a significantly longer overall survival than those without second malignancies. An interval of <1 year between the diagnosis of RCC and the second primary was the strongest predictor of poor overall survival in RCC patients with a second malignancy.

However, the patients who had a moderately large-sized DVC (2.3-2.8 cm(2)) regained their continence significantly sooner (mean duration = 2.1 months) than those with small (3.7 months, p = 0.002) or extremely large DVC (4.0 months, p = 0.006). In a multivariate analysis, DVC size, age, transfusion and the length of membranous urethra were significant predictors of continence recovery.

Methods:   Sex steroids were assessed the day before surgery (7-11 a.m.) in a cohort of 605 patients with a median follow-up of 24 months following RP. Cox regression models tested the association between predictors [including age, body mass index (BMI), prostate-specific antigen (PSA), clinical stage, biopsy Gleason scores, tT, hypogonadism, E2, and SHBG] and early BCR (defined as a PSA ≥ 0.1 ng/ml that occurred within 24 months after RP).

Recently, a number of case-control studies were conducted to investigate the association between TLR4 gene polymorphism and cancer risk, especially Asp299Gly and Thr399Ile polymorphisms. However, published data were still conflicting. In this paper, we summarized 9463 cancer cases and 10,825 controls from 22 studies and attempted to assess the susceptibility of TLR4 gene polymorphism to cancers by a synthetical meta-analysis. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated to assess the relationship. Our results suggested that Asp299Gly represented a risk factor on cancers in digestive system (G allele versus A allele, OR=1.64, 95% CI: 1.02-2.64; GA+GG versus AA, OR=1.64, 95% CI: 1.00-2.71) but tend to have a protective effect on prostate cancer (GG versus AA, OR=0.37, 95% CI: 0.14-0.98; GG versus GA+AA, OR=0.37, 95% CI: 0.14-0.98).

In the context of metastatic disease, invading cancer cells hijack autophagic processes to survive and adapt in the host microenvironment. We sought to understand how autophagy is regulated in the metastatic niche for prostate cancer (PCa) cells where bone marrow stromal cell (BMSC) paracrine signaling induces PCa neuroendocrine differentiation (NED). In PCa, this transdifferentiation of metastatic PCa cells to neuronal-like cells correlates with advanced disease. Because autophagy provides a survival advantage for cancer cells and promotes cell differentiation, we hypothesized that autophagy mediates PCa NED in the bone. Thus, we determined the ability of paracrine factors in conditioned media (CM) from two separate BMSC subtypes, HS5 and HS27a, to induce autophagy in C4-2 and C4-2B bone metastatic PCa cells by characterizing the autophagy marker, LC3. Unlike HS27a CM, HS5 CM induced LC3 accumulation in PCa cells, suggesting autophagy was induced and indicating that HS5 and HS27a secrete a different milieu of paracrine factors that influence PCa autophagy. We identified interleukin-6 (IL-6), a cytokine more highly expressed in HS5 cells than in HS27a cells, as a paracrine factor that regulates PCa autophagy. Pharmacological inhibition of STAT3 activity did not attenuate LC3 accumulation, implying that IL-6 regulates NED and autophagy through different pathways. Finally, chloroquine inhibition of autophagic flux blocked PCa NED; hence autophagic flux maintains NED.

Methods:   From 1995 to 2008, 503 Japanese patients undergoing RP for clinically localized prostate cancer were included in the validation cohort. The BCR-free rate was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Performance of the CAPRA score was assessed using Cox proportional hazards regression models, concordance index (c-index) and calibration plots.  Results:   Unlike the results in the Cancer of the Prostate Strategic Urologic Research Endeavor (CaPSURE) cohort, the BCR-free rate and the hazard ratio for CAPRA score 4 were inversely better than those for CAPRA scores 2 and 3 in Japanese patients. The c-index of the CAPRA score was 0.673. The calibration plot demonstrated that the CAPRA score was generally well calibrated.  Conclusions:   In Japanese patients, the CAPRA score can predict BCR after RP only to some degree. Although our c-index is comparable with the c-index of 0.66 in the original CaPSURE cohort, it is lower than the c-indices reported in other validation cohorts, which range from 0.68 to 0.81.

We conducted this study to determine if increasing the number of prostate needle biopsies in patients with prostate cancer improves the accuracy of Gleason scores in the Taiwanese population.  Methods:   Between March 2000 and September 2009, 281 patients underwent radical prostatectomy at Taipei Veterans General Hospital. All of these patients had prostate cancer that was diagnosed and graded either by extended needle biopsy (121 patients, ≥ 10 cores/patient, range: 10-13, median: 12) or by traditional sextant transrectal biopsy (160 patients, <10 cores/patient, range: 6-9, median: 6). We analyzed the patients' Gleason scores of their biopsies and radical prostatectomy specimens.  Results:   The concordance rate, defined as similarity between the Gleason score of a patient's biopsy and prostatectomy specimens, was 57.9% in the extended biopsy group and 45.6% in the nonextended biopsy group (χ(2) test: p = 0.042). The primary Gleason pattern was accurately predicted by extended needle biopsy in 81% of cases (98/121 cases), higher than the 70% accuracy rate of the nonextended biopsies (112/160 cases, p = 0.036). Undergrading was found in 43/121 cases (32%) and 63/160 cases (39.4%) (p = 0.511).

Recent data suggests higher radiation doses decrease local recurrence and may ultimately benefit biochemical, metastasis-free and disease-specific survival. No randomized data is available on the benefits of long-term hormonal therapy (HT) in these patients. A prospective study on the efficacy and safety of trimodality treatment consisting of HT, external beam radiation therapy (EBRT), and brachytherapy (BT) for high-risk prostate cancer (PCa) is strongly required.  Methods/design:   This is a phase III, multicenter, randomized controlled trial (RCT) of trimodality with BT, EBRT, and HT for high-risk PCa (TRIP) that will investigate the impact of adjuvant HT following BT using iodine-125 ((125)I-BT) and supplemental EBRT with neoadjuvant and concurrent HT. Prior to the end of September 2012, a total of 340 patients with high-risk PCa will be enrolled and randomized to one of two treatment arms. These patients will be recruited from more than 41 institutions, all of which have broad experience with (125)I-BT. Pathological slides will be centrally reviewed to confirm patient eligibility. The patients will commonly undergo 6-month HT with combined androgen blockade (CAB) before and during (125)I-BT and supplemental EBRT. Those randomly assigned to the long-term HT group will subsequently undergo 2 years of adjuvant HT with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist. All participants will be assessed at baseline and every 3 months for the first 30 months, then every 6 months until 84 months from the beginning of CAB.The primary endpoint is biochemical progression-free survival. Secondary endpoints are overall survival, clinical progression-free survival, disease-specific survival, salvage therapy non-adaptive interval, and adverse events.  Discussion:   To our knowledge, there have been no prospective studies documenting the efficacy and safety of trimodality therapy for high-risk PCa. The present RCT is expected to provide additional insight regarding the potency and limitations of the addition of 2 years of adjuvant HT to this trimodality approach, and to establish an appropriate treatment strategy for high-risk PCa.

Methods:   Two prostate cell lines (LNCaP and DU145) and two primary cells, Peripheral Blood Lymphocytes [PBL] and Monocyte-derived Macrophages [MDM] were infected with XMRV.

Medical castration and anti-androgen treatment were used sequentially as delayed-combined androgen blockade therapy. Time to prostate-specific antigen biochemical failure was estimated, and risk factors for prostate-specific antigen biochemical failure were evaluated.  Results:   The average patient age was 76.4 years (range, 59-91 years), the median observation period was 52.8 months (range, 26-106.6 months) and the median pre-treatment prostate-specific antigen level was 14 ng/ml (range, 3.68-492 ng/ml). The TNM classification distribution was as follows: T1c, n= 27; T2a, n = 39; T2b, n = 20; and T3a, n = 6. In the multivariate analysis, Gleason's score ≥8 (P < 0.05; hazard ratio, 3.02), prostate-specific antigen nadir >1.4 ng/ml (P = 0.001; hazard ratio, 8.76) and a half-life of the prostate-specific antigen level >1.2 months (P < 0.005; hazard ratio, 6.3) during the initial 6 months of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist monotherapy were significant independent risk factors for prostate-specific antigen biochemical failure with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist monotherapy. The high-risk group, which had at least one of these three risk factors, had a shorter time to prostate-specific antigen biochemical failure than the low-risk group, during luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist monotherapy (P < 0.0001). For the total delayed-combined androgen blockade therapy observation period, the free-prostate-specific antigen biochemical failure rate was 88.3% at 5 years.

Although this treatment is initially effective, tumors invariably relapse as incurable, castration-resistant PC (CRPC). Adaptation of androgen-dependent PC cells to an androgen-depleted environment or selection of pre-existing, CRPC cells have been proposed as mechanisms of CRPC development. Stem cell (SC)-like PC cells have been implicated not only as tumor initiating/maintaining in PC but also as tumor-reinitiating cells in CRPC. Recently, castration-resistant cells expressing the NK3 homeobox 1 (Nkx3-1) (CARNs), the other luminal markers cytokeratin 18 (CK18) and androgen receptor (AR), and possessing SC properties, have been found in castrated mouse prostate and proposed as the cell-of-origin of CRPC. However, the human counterpart of CARNs has not been identified yet. Here, we demonstrate that in the human PC xenograft BM18, pre-existing SC-like and neuroendocrine (NE) PC cells are selected by castration and survive as totally quiescent. SC-like BM18 cells, displaying the SC markers aldehyde dehydrogenase 1A1 or NANOG, coexpress the luminal markers NKX3-1, CK18, and a low level of AR (AR(low)) but not basal or NE markers. These CR luminal SC-like cells, but not NE cells, reinitiate BM18 tumor growth after androgen replacement. The AR(low) seems to mediate directly both castration survival and tumor reinitiation. This study identifies for the first time in human PC SC-/CARN-like cells that may represent the cell-of-origin of tumor reinitiation as CRPC. This finding will be fundamental for refining the hierarchy among human PC cancer cells and may have important clinical implications.""","""['Markus Germann', 'Antoinette Wetterwald', 'Natalia Guzmán-Ramirez', 'Gabri van der Pluijm', 'Zoran Culig', 'Marco G Cecchini', 'Elizabeth D Williams', 'George N Thalmann']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Stem Cells""","""['Conversion from a paracrine to an autocrine mechanism of androgen-stimulated growth during malignant transformation of prostatic epithelial cells.', 'Testosterone boosts for treatment of castration resistant prostate cancer: an experimental implementation of intermittent androgen deprivation.', 'Midkine is associated with neuroendocrine differentiation in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptor (AR) expression in prostate cancer and progression of the tumor: Lessons from cell lines, animal models and human specimens.', 'The molecular and cellular origin of human prostate cancer.', 'Exploring the Onset and Progression of Prostate Cancer through a Multicellular Agent-based Model.', 'The testosterone paradox of advanced prostate cancer: mechanistic insights and clinical implications.', 'Nonmalignant AR-positive prostate epithelial cells and cancer cells respond differently to androgen.', 'Prediction of Biochemical Recurrence Based on Molecular Detection of Lymph Node Metastasis After Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Spatio-temporal analysis of prostate tumors in situ suggests pre-existence of treatment-resistant clones.']"""

In the present study, the potential effects of C. indicum on signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling pathway in different tumor cells were examined. The solvent fractions (hexane, CH₂Cl₂, EtOAc, and BuOH,) were obtained from a crude extract (80% EOH extract) of C. indicum. The methylene chloride fraction of C. indicum (MCI) exhibited strong cytotoxic activity as compared with the other fractions and clearly suppressed constitutive STAT3 activation against both DU145 and U266 cells, but not MDA-MB-231 cells. The suppression of constitutive STAT3 activation by MCI is associated with blocking upstream JAK1 and JAK2, but not Src. MCI downregulated the expression of STAT3-regulated gene products; this is correlated with the accumulation of the cell cycle at sub-G1 phase, the induction of caspase-3 activation, and apoptosis. Moreover, the major components of the MCI were bioactive compounds such as sudachitin, hesperetin, chrysoeriol, and acacetin. Sudachitin, chrysoeriol, and acacetin also exerted significantly cytotoxicity, clearly suppressed constitutive STAT3 activation, and induced apoptosis, although hesperetin did not show any significant effect in DU145 cells.

Results:   : In fee-for-service Medicare, higher-spending areas had higher rates of recommended care (curative surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy for early-stage non-small-cell lung cancer and chemotherapy for stage III colon cancer) and preference-sensitive care (chemotherapy for stage IV lung and colon cancer and primary treatment of local/regional prostate cancer) and had lower lung cancer mortality. In the VA, we observed minimal variation in care by area-level Medicare spending.

We have found that forced overexpression of TRPM8 in PC-3 cells can inhibit the cell proliferation and motility probably through the TRPM8 activation. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether activating the TRPM8 channel by its selective agonist menthol can inhibit the proliferation and motility of androgen-independent prostate cancer (AIPC) with remarkable expression of TRPM8. Menthol is a naturally occurring compound, which has been widely used in cosmetics and pharmaceutical products, and also as flavoring in food. DU145 cells are androgen-independent but have a remarkable expression of TRPM8. The demonstration of the existence of TRPM8 and the absence of TRPA1 in DU145 cells provided the foundation for the following experiments, because both TRPM8 and TRPA1 are molecular targets of menthol. The outcome of MTT assay indicated that menthol inhibited the cell growth (p < 0.01). Cell cycle distribution and scratch assay analysis revealed that menthol induced cell cycle arrest at the G(0)/G(1) phase (p < 0.01). Furthermore, menthol inhibited the migration of DU145 cells by downregulating the focal-adhesion kinase. So it suggests that the activation of the existing TRPM8 channels may serve as a potential and pragmatic treatment for those AIPC with remarkable expression of TRPM8, and menthol is a useful compound for future development as an anticancer agent.""","""['Yongzhi Wang', 'Xinghuan Wang', 'Zhonghua Yang', 'Guangbin Zhu', 'Dong Chen', 'Zhe Meng']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Pathol Oncol Res""","""['Erratum to: Menthol Inhibits the Proliferation and Motility of Prostate Cancer DU145 Cells.', 'Menthol regulates TRPM8-independent processes in PC-3 prostate cancer cells.', 'Inhibition of TRPM8 by icilin distinct from desensitization induced by menthol and menthol derivatives.', 'Differentiation dependent expression of TRPA1 and TRPM8 channels in IMR-32 human neuroblastoma cells.', 'TRPM8 in prostate cancer cells: a potential diagnostic and prognostic marker with a secretory function?', 'TRPM8 and prostate: a cold case?', 'Therapeutic potential of TRPM8 channels in cancer treatment.', 'Menthol: An underestimated anticancer agent.', 'Calcium signalling pathways in prostate cancer initiation and progression.', 'Anti-leukemic effect of menthol, a peppermint compound, on induction of apoptosis and autophagy.', 'TRPM8 as an Anti-Tumoral Target in Prostate Cancer Growth and Metastasis Dissemination.']"""

It is recommended that all cases of PCa should be diagnosed with needle biopsy before treatment. The exclusion criteria for those that may not be suitable have not yet been defined.  Materials and methods:   We reviewed all the patients diagnosed with PCa at the Nnamdi Azikiwe University Teaching Hospital Nnewi, Southeast, Nigeria, from January 2007 to December 2010. Relevant biodata and method of diagnosis of PCa before treatment were reviewed.  Results:   A total of 133 patients had bilateral orchidectomy over the period. 120 (90.2%) had their diagnosis confirmed by needle biopsy before bilateral orchidectomy (category 1), while 13 (9.8%) had bilateral orchidectomy before diagnosis was confirmed. The method of diagnosis for category 1 patients was with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), abnormal DRE findings, elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and transrectal needle biopsy. For category 11 patients, diagnosis of PCa was suspected based on LUTS, abnormal DRE findings, and elevated PSA. Of this number, 11 (84.6%) had, in addition, sudden onset paraplegia at presentation, while 2 (15.4%) had severe uncontrolled hematuria at presentation. All the patients in both categories had needle biopsy confirmation of their disease. The sensitivity of PSA was 99.2%.  Conclusion:   Needle biopsy of the prostate is the preferred method for the diagnosis of PCa in most cases before treatment is undertaken. There are valid reasons why all PCas will not be diagnosed in this fashion. Elevated PSA when combined with an abnormal DRE finding increases the predictive value for cancer. In areas where pathologists are lacking, abnormal DRE and elevated PSA results can be a guide to proceed to treatment especially, where there is severe compromise of patients' quality of life due to symptoms of advanced PCa while awaiting confirmation.""","""['C K Oranusi', 'A I Ugezu', 'Ame Nwofor']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Niger J Clin Pract""","""['The digital rectal examination (DRE) remains important - outcomes from a contemporary cohort of men undergoing an initial 12-18 core prostate needle biopsy.', 'An overview of cancer of the prostate diagnosis and management in Nigeria: the experience in a Nigerian tertiary hospital.', 'A multicenter study on the detection of prostate cancer by digital rectal examination and prostate-specific antigen in men with or without urinary symptoms.

Methods and materials:   Between 2006 and 2008, 109 patients were consecutively enrolled. MA was assessed by choline and citrate peak area-to-noise-ratio <5:1. Cancerous metabolism (CM) was defined by choline-to-creatine ratio >1.5:1 or choline signal-to-noise-ratio >5:1. To test the strength of association between MRSI results and the time elapsed since EBRT (TEFRT), PSA levels, Gleason score (GS), and stage, logistic regression (LR) was performed. p value <0.05 was statistically significant. The patients' outcomes were verified in 2011.  Results:   MRSI documented MA in 84 of 109 and CM in 25 of 109 cases. LR showed that age, GS, stage, and initial and recent PSA had no significant impact on MRSI results which were significantly related to PSA values at the time of MRSI and to TEFRT. Patients were divided into three groups according to TEFRT: <1 year, 1-2 years, and >2 years. MA was detected in 54.1% of patients of group 1, 88.9% of group 2, and in 94.5% of group 3 (100% when PSA nadir was reached). CM was detected in 50% of patients with reached PSA nadir in group 1. Local relapse was found in 3 patients previously showing CM at long TEFRT.  Conclusion:   MA detection, indicative of successful treatment because growth of normal or abnormal cells cannot occur without metabolism, increases with decreasing PSA levels and increasing time on HT after EBRT. This supports long-term HT in advanced prostate cancer.

Methods/design:   A 12-month prospective, single-blinded, randomized controlled trial will be conducted to compare the Exercise Group with the Control Group. Sixty men with prostate cancer who will be starting ADT will be recruited and randomly assigned to one of the two groups: the Exercise Group will receive instructions in setting up an individualized 12-month home-based walking exercise program, while the Control Group will receive standard medical advice from the attending physician. A number of outcome measures will be used to assess bone health, physical function, and health-related quality of life. At baseline and 12 months, bone health will be assessed using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry.

The selection concerned data from 1997-2008 and, except for prostate cancer, only patients without distant metastases were included.  Results:   Between 1997 and 2008, the use of primary external radiotherapy increased approximately 7% in breast cancer patients and approximately 30% in rectal cancer patients. In the latter group preoperative radiotherapy strongly increased, while postoperative radiotherapy decreased. For prostate cancer there was an increase in brachytherapy (9%). The use of external beam radiotherapy in patients with prostate cancer and non-small cell lung cancer remained the same. Regional differences in the extent of use of radiotherapy for breast and rectal cancer clearly decreased. These differences remained limited for external beam radiotherapy in prostate and non-small cell lung cancer. Older patients less often received radiotherapy.  Conclusion:   The increase in use of radiotherapy for breast cancer is explained by the increase in breast conserving surgery.

One hundred twenty (91.6%) patients received supplemental EBRT and 100 (76.4%) received androgen deprivation therapy (median duration, 19.5 months; range, 4-36 months). The median postimplant day 0 D(90) (i.e., the minimum percentage of the prescription dose that covers the planning target volume) was 121.9% of prescription dose. Multiple clinical treatment and dosimetric parameters were evaluated for impact on the evaluated survival parameters.  Results:   The median pretreatment PSA and Gleason score were 11.0ng/mL and 8. One hundred ten (84%) patients had a Gleason score ≥8. At 9 and 12 years, the cause-specific survival, biochemical progression-free survival, and overall survival were 91.0% and 86.5%, 87.3% and 87.3%, and 70.5% and 60.5%, respectively. The most common cause of death was heart disease (22.2%) with deaths from nonprostate cancer (12.7%) and prostate cancer (8.3%) being less likely.  Conclusions:   Permanent interstitial brachytherapy usually with supplemental EBRT and androgen deprivation therapy results in excellent biochemical control and cause-specific survival in the most unfavorable subset of high-risk prostate cancer patients. Death from diseases of the heart was more than twice as likely as death from prostate cancer.""","""['Nathan Bittner', 'Gregory S Merrick', 'Wayne M Butler', 'Robert W Galbreath', 'Jonathan Lief', 'Edward Adamovich', 'Kent E Wallner']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Brachytherapy""","""['Impact of supplemental external beam radiotherapy and/or androgen deprivation therapy on biochemical outcome after permanent prostate brachytherapy.', 'Lack of benefit from a short course of androgen deprivation for unfavorable prostate cancer patients treated with an accelerated hypofractionated regime.', 'Influence of body mass index on biochemical outcome after permanent prostate brachytherapy.', ""High-dose-rate intensity-modulated brachytherapy with external beam radiotherapy for prostate cancer: California endocurietherapy's 10-year results."", 'Current issues in techniques of prostate brachytherapy.', 'A Review on the Current Treatment Paradigm in High-Risk Prostate Cancer.', 'Combined-modality 125J-seed-brachytherapy, external beam radiation and androgen deprivation therapy of unfavorable-risk prostate cancer: report of outcomes and side-effects.', 'American Brachytherapy Society Task Group Report: Use of androgen deprivation therapy with prostate brachytherapy-A systematic literature review.', 'Recovery of serum testosterone following neoadjuvant and adjuvant androgen deprivation therapy in men treated with prostate brachytherapy.', 'Additional androgen deprivation makes the difference: Biochemical recurrence-free survival in prostate cancer patients after HDR brachytherapy and external beam radiotherapy.']"""

There are evidences that cancer progression is characterized by disruption and/or reorganization of cytoskeleton (i.e. cellular scaffold). This is accompanied by various molecular alterations influencing the overall mechanical resistance of cells. Current approach in diagnosis focuses mainly on microbiological, immunological, and pathological aspects rather than on the biomechanics of diseases. The determination of mechanical properties of an individual living cell has became possible with the development of local measurement techniques, such as atomic force microscopy, magnetic or optical tweezers. The advantage of them lies in the capability to measure living cells at a single cell level and in liquid conditions, close to natural environment. Here, we present the studies on mechanical properties of single cells originating from various cancers. The results show that, independently of the cancer type (bladder, melanoma, prostate, breast and colon), single cells are characterized by the lower Young's modulus, denoting higher deformability of cancerous cells. However, the obtained Young's modulus values were dependent on various factors, like the properties of substrates used for cell growth, force loading rate, or indentation depth. Their influence on elastic properties of cells was considered. Based on these findings, the identification of cancerous cells based on their elastic properties was performed. These results proved the AFM capability in recognition of a single, mechanically altered cell, also in cases when morphological changes are not visible. The quantitative analysis of cell deformability carried out using normal (reference) and cancerous cells and, more precisely, their characterization (qualitative and quantitative) can have a significant impact on the development of methodological approaches toward precise identification of pathological cells and would allow for more effective detection of cancer-related changes.""","""['Małgorzata Lekka', 'Katarzyna Pogoda', 'Justyna Gostek', 'Olesya Klymenko', 'Szymon Prauzner-Bechcicki', 'Joanna Wiltowska-Zuber', 'Justyna Jaczewska', 'Janusz Lekki', 'Zbigniew Stachura']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Micron""","""['Applicability of atomic force microscopy to determine cancer-related changes in cells.', 'AFM indentation study of breast cancer cells.', 'Cancer cell detection in tissue sections using AFM.', 'Comparison of mechanical properties of normal and malignant thyroid cells.', 'Atomic force microscopy in mechanobiology: measuring microelastic heterogeneity of living cells.', 'Insights in Cell Biomechanics through Atomic Force Microscopy.', 'Pancreatic Cancer Presents Distinct Nanomechanical Properties During Progression.', 'Application of self-organizing maps to AFM-based viscoelastic characterization of breast cancer cell mechanics.', 'Determining Spatial Variability of Elastic Properties for Biological Samples Using AFM.', 'Automatic Multi-functional Integration Program (AMFIP) towards all-optical mechano-electrophysiology interrogation.']"""

Triggers and stressors""","""Objective:   This study examined general and cancer-related stressors of depression that are unique to African-American cancer patients.  Method:   The study used cohort design and mixed methods. Seventy-four breast and prostate cancer survivors including 34 depressed and 23 non-depressed African-Americans and 17 depressed whites were interviewed. Qualitative data analysis identified themes. The thematic codes were converted to a SPSS data set numerically. The Fisher's exact test was performed to examine group differences in the experience of stress.  Results:   Significantly more depressed African-Americans experienced a dramatic reaction to a cancer diagnosis (p = 0.03) or had concerns about functional decline (p = 0.01), arguments with relatives or friends (p = 0.02), and unemployment status (p = 0.03) than did non-depressed African-Americans, who reacted to the cancer diagnosis as a matter of reality (p = 0.02). Significantly more depressed African-Americans talked about feeling shocked by a cancer diagnosis (p = 0.04) and being unable to do things that they used to do (p = 0.02) than did depressed whites. Qualitative analysis shed light on the extent of such group differences.  Significance of results:   Distress from the initial cancer diagnosis and functional decline were likely to have triggered or worsened depression in African-American cancer patients. This study highlighted racial differences in this aspect. It is critical to screen African-American cancer patients for depression at two critical junctures: immediately after the disclosure of a cancer diagnosis and at the onset of functional decline.

The prostate is a potential target for cadmium carcinogenesis, although the underlying mechanisms are still unclear. Furthermore, cadmium may induce cell death by apoptosis in various cell types, and it has been hypothesized that a key factor in cadmium-induced malignant transformation is acquisition of apoptotic resistance. We investigated the in vitro effects produced by cadmium exposure in normal or tumor cells derived from human prostate epithelium, including RWPE-1 and its cadmium-transformed derivative CTPE, the primary adenocarcinoma 22Rv1 and CWR-R1 cells and LNCaP, PC-3 and DU145 metastatic cancer cell lines. Cells were treated for 24 hours with different concentrations of CdCl(2) and apoptosis, cell cycle distribution and expression of tumor suppressor proteins were analyzed. Subsequently, cellular response to cadmium was evaluated after siRNA-mediated p53 silencing in wild type p53-expressing RWPE-1 and LNCaP cells, and after adenoviral p53 overexpression in p53-deficient DU145 and PC-3 cell lines. The cell lines exhibited different sensitivity to cadmium, and 24-hour exposure to different CdCl(2) concentrations induced dose- and cell type-dependent apoptotic response and inhibition of cell proliferation that correlated with accumulation of functional p53 and overexpression of p21 in wild type p53-expressing cell lines. On the other hand, p53 silencing was able to suppress cadmium-induced apoptosis. Our results demonstrate that cadmium can induce p53-dependent apoptosis in human prostate epithelial cells and suggest p53 mutation as a possible contributing factor for the acquisition of apoptotic resistance in cadmium prostatic carcinogenesis.""","""['Pierpaolo Aimola', 'Marco Carmignani', 'Anna Rita Volpe', 'Altomare Di Benedetto', 'Luigi Claudio', 'Michael P Waalkes', 'Adrie van Bokhoven', 'Erik J Tokar', 'Pier Paolo Claudio']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Acquisition of apoptotic resistance in cadmium-transformed human prostate epithelial cells: Bcl-2 overexpression blocks the activation of JNK signal transduction pathway.', 'Leptomycin B stabilizes and activates p53 in primary prostatic epithelial cells and induces apoptosis in the LNCaP cell line.', 'Induction of Plac8 promotes pro-survival function of autophagy in cadmium-induced prostate carcinogenesis.', 'Altered apoptotic gene expression and acquired apoptotic resistance in cadmium-transformed human prostate epithelial cells.', 'Stem Cells as Target for Prostate cancer Therapy: Opportunities and Challenges.', 'Highlights of Strategies Targeting Fibroblasts for Novel Therapies for Rheumatoid Arthritis.', 'The Multifaceted Roles of Proline in Cell Behavior.', 'Acinetobacter tandoii ZM06 Assists Glutamicibacter nicotianae ZM05 in Resisting Cadmium Pressure to Preserve Dipropyl Phthalate Biodegradation.', 'The role of autophagy in metal-induced urogenital carcinogenesis.', 'A Systematic Review on Metal Dynamics and Marine Toxicity Risk Assessment Using Crustaceans as Bioindicators.']"""

Western blot analysis revealed troglitazone-induced phosphorylation of Erk in both PC-3 and C4-2 cells. Troglitazone-induced increases in Erk phosphorylation were suppressed by the MEK inhibitor U0126 but not by the PPARγ antagonist GW9662. Pretreatment with U0126 did not alter the ability of troglitazone to regulate expression of two proteins that control cell cycle, p21, and c-Myc.

DWI-MRI was performed at 1.5 T with a body coil combined with a spine coil in consecutive 100 cases. The histopathology of biopsies has been used as reference standard. Two examiners were evaluating MRI and TRUS, both of them were blinded regarding pathological findings. Accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity were statistically analyzed.  Results:   Based on pathological diagnosis: group A (cancerous); 75 cases and group B (non-cancerous); 25 cases. Mean age was 65.3 and 62.8 years in groups A and B, respectively. Mean PSA was 30.7 and 9.2 ng/mL in groups A and B, respectively. Sensitivity of DWI was 58.3% while specificity was 83.8%. Accuracy of lesion detection was 52.4-77.8% (P < 0.05).

In April 2009, coverage for PET performed to inform the initial treatment strategy of most solid tumors was expanded by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, but they continued to require CED for subsequent treatment strategy evaluations for many cancers.  Methods:   For all years, we assessed National Oncologic PET Registry data for bladder, kidney, pancreas, prostate, stomach, small cell lung, uterine, and all other cancers that required CED. We compared clinical profiles and changes in intended management by interval (before or after April 2009, designated as the 2006 and 2009 cohorts) for PET scans performed for restaging or suspected recurrence (2006, n = 30,911; 2009, n = 54,747) or for chemotherapy monitoring (2006, n = 10,234; 2009, n = 15,611).  Results:   There were slight differences between time periods but little difference by cancer type or patient age within a time period. For restaging or suspected recurrence, comparing the 2006 and 2009 cohorts, total change in intended management for all cancer types was about 33% in those younger than 65 y and about 35% in those older than 65 y (range by cancer type, 31%-41%). The referring physician impression of disease extent (restaging) or prognosis (chemotherapy monitoring) after PET was similar between cohorts. In the 2009 cohort, PET for chemotherapy monitoring was associated with a 25% increase in plans to continue therapy and a complementary decline in plans to adjust therapy. The greatest management impact of PET was during chemotherapy monitoring in the 2009 cohort, where a post-PET prognosis judged to be worse than before PET was associated with a plan to discontinue that therapy in 90% and to change to a different therapy in 65%.  Conclusion:   Our data demonstrate a similar impact of PET on planned management of cancer patients before and after the 2009 expansion of coverage. These results strongly suggest it is unlikely that new useful information will be obtained by extending the coverage of certain cancer types and indications only under CED.

Common drawbacks to automated imaging systems include an inability to classify tissue type and an inability to segregate cytoplasmic and nuclear staining.  Methods:   Immunohistochemistry for the membranous marker α-catenin, the cytoplasmic marker stathmin and the nuclear marker Ki-67 was performed on tissue microarrays (TMA) of archival formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue comprising 471 (α-catenin and stathmin) and 511 (Ki-67) cases of prostate adenocarcinoma. These TMA were quantitatively analysed using two commercially available automated image analysers, the Ariol SL-50 system and the Nuance system from CRi. Both systems use brightfield microscopy for automated, unbiased and standardised quantification of immunohistochemistry, while the Nuance system has spectral deconvolution capabilities.  Results:   Overall concordance between scores from both systems was excellent (r=0.90; 0.83-0.95). The software associated with the multispectral imager allowed accurate automated classification of tissue type into epithelial glandular structures and stroma, and a single-step segmentation of staining into cytoplasmic or nuclear compartments allowing independent evaluation of these areas. The Nuance system, however, was not able to distinguish reliably between tumour and non-tumour tissue. In addition, variance in the labour and time required for analysis between the two systems was also noted.

All cells were stained with Hoechst 33342 and propidium iodide and visualized under a fluorescence microscope. Necrosis was observed at: a) 8000 protons per cell (corresponding to ∼209 Gy/cell) after 2-4 passages, b) 3200 protons per cell (corresponding to ∼84 Gy/cell) for cells after 11-14 passages and c) only 800 protons per cell (corresponding to ∼2 Gy/cell ) after 47-50 passages.

However, the molecular mechanisms that drive this synthetic lethality remain unclear. Here, we show increased levels of Mre11, a key component of MRN (Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1) complex that plays a role in the restart of stalled replication forks and enhanced resection at stalled replication forks in BRCA2-deficient cells. BRCA2-deficient cells also showed hypersensitivity to the Mre11 inhibitor mirin. Interestingly, PARP1 activity was required to protect stalled forks from Mre11-dependent degradation. Resistance to PARP inhibition in BRCA2-mutant cells led to reduced levels of Mre11 foci and also rescued their sensitivity to mirin. Taken together, our findings not only show that Mre11 activity is required for the survival of BRCA2 mutant cells but also elucidate roles for both the BRCA2 and PARP1 proteins in protecting stalled replication forks, which offers insight into the molecular mechanisms of the synthetic lethality between BRCA2 and PARP1.""","""['Songmin Ying', 'Freddie C Hamdy', 'Thomas Helleday']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Cancer Res""","""['DNA-PKcs and PARP1 Bind to Unresected Stalled DNA Replication Forks Where They Recruit XRCC1 to Mediate Repair.', 'Synthetic viability by BRCA2 and PARP1/ARTD1 deficiencies.', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase is hyperactivated in homologous recombination-defective cells.', 'Mechanisms of PARP inhibitor sensitivity and resistance.', 'Moonlighting at replication forks - a new life for homologous recombination proteins BRCA1, BRCA2 and RAD51.', 'Alkylation of nucleobases by 2-chloro-N,N-diethylethanamine hydrochloride (CDEAH) sensitizes PARP1-deficient tumors.', 'The Multiple Faces of the MRN Complex: Roles in Medulloblastoma and Beyond.', 'Selective Killing of BRCA2-Deficient Ovarian Cancer Cells via MRE11 Blockade.', 'Innate immunity mediator STING modulates nascent DNA metabolism at stalled forks in human cells.', 'Discovery of synthetic lethal interactions from large-scale pan-cancer perturbation screens.']"""

Methods:   Implanted iodine brachytherapy seeds are segmented via a region-based implicit active contour model. Overlapping seed groups are then resolved using a template-based declustering technique.  Results:   Ground truth seed coordinates were obtained through manual segmentation.

The major metabolic pathways of flutamide are hydroxylation and hydrolysis. The hydrolyzed metabolite, 5-amino-2-nitrobenzotrifluoride (FLU-1), is further metabolized to N-hydroxy FLU-1, an assumed hepatotoxicant. Our previous study demonstrated that arylacetamide deacetylase (AADAC), one of the major serine esterases expressed in the human liver and gastrointestinal tract, catalyzes the flutamide hydrolysis. However, the enzyme kinetics in human tissue microsomes were not consistent with the kinetics by recombinant human AADAC. Thus, it seemed that AADAC is not the sole enzyme responsible for flutamide hydrolysis in human. In the present study, we found that recombinant carboxylesterase (CES) 2 could hydrolyze flutamide at low concentrations of flutamide. In the inhibition assay, the flutamide hydrolase activities at a flutamide concentration of 5 μM in human liver and jejunum microsomes were strongly inhibited by a selective CES2 inhibitor, 10 μM loperamide, with the residual activities of 22.9 ± 3.5 and 18.6 ± 0.7%, respectively. These results suggest that CES2 is also involved in the flutamide hydrolysis in human tissues. Using six individual human livers, the contributions of AADAC and CES2 to flutamide hydrolysis were estimated by using the relative activity factor. The relative contribution of CES2 was approximately 75 to 99% at the concentration of 5 μM flutamide. In contrast, the relative contribution of AADAC increased in parallel with the concentration of flutamide. Thus, CES2, rather than AADAC, largely contributed to the flutamide hydrolysis in clinical therapeutics.""","""['Yuki Kobayashi', 'Tatsuki Fukami', 'Mai Shimizu', 'Miki Nakajima', 'Tsuyoshi Yokoi']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Drug Metab Dispos""","""['Human arylacetamide deacetylase is a principal enzyme in flutamide hydrolysis.', 'Indiplon is hydrolyzed by arylacetamide deacetylase in human liver.', 'Comparison of substrate specificity among human arylacetamide deacetylase and carboxylesterases.', 'Role of Human Orphan Esterases in Drug-induced Toxicity.', 'The emerging role of human esterases.', 'Fluorine impairs carboxylesterase 1-mediated hydrolysis of T-2 toxin and increases its chondrocyte toxicity.', 'Identification of a nine-gene prognostic signature for gastric carcinoma using integrated bioinformatics analyses.', 'Inhibition of human carboxylesterases by ginsenosides: structure-activity relationships and inhibitory mechanism.', 'Metabolic Hydrolysis of Aromatic Amides in Selected Rat, Minipig, and Human In Vitro Systems.', 'Structure-Activity Relationships of Pentacyclic Triterpenoids as Potent and Selective Inhibitors against Human Carboxylesterase 1.']"""

To accomplish that, we identified men who underwent SRT after radical prostatectomy for PCa and failed SRT. PSA doubling time (PSADT) was used as a surrogate endpoint for cancer aggressiveness. We compared PSADT calculated before start of SRT and after SRT failure.  Methods:   Of 287 men in the SEARCH database since 1988 who underwent SRT, we detected 78 with SRT failure defined as PSA ≥ 0.2 ng/mL above the post-SRT nadir. Of these, 39 had PSADT available before and after SRT, which was compared using Wilcoxon's paired test with men serving as their own controls. We tested predictors of PSADT change using multivariable logistic regression.  Results:   There were no differences in PSADT before and after SRT (10.2 vs 12.6 months; P = .46). However, in some individual cases, large changes were observed. Only seminal vesicle invasion showed a trend towards an association with a shorter post-SRT PSADT relative to the pre-SRT PSADT (P = .13).  Conclusion:   Overall, the PSADT after and before SRT were statistically identical, suggesting that after SRT failure, PCa does not emerge with more aggressive biological features.

All patients underwent transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) and Doppler-guided sextant and targeted biopsies at entry.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Post-therapy follow-up included measuring prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level every 3-6 mo; TRUS biopsies at 6-12 mo and yearly, as indicated; and validated symptom questionnaires.

We evaluated the ability of these criteria to predict three pathologic end points: insignificant disease defined using a classical and updated formulation, and organ-confined Gleason ≤ 6 prostate cancer. Measures of diagnostic accuracy and areas under the receiver operating curve were calculated for each protocol and compared.  Results and limitations:   A total of 75% of the patients met the inclusion criteria of at least one protocol; 23% were eligible for AS by all studied criteria. The PRIAS and UM criteria had the best balance between sensitivity and specificity for both definitions of insignificant prostate cancer and a higher discriminative ability for the end points than any criteria including patients with two or more positive cores. The Epstein criteria demonstrated high specificity but low sensitivity for all pathologic end points, and therefore the discriminative ability was not superior to those of other protocols.

The extent to which the guideline-derived plans meet the dosimetric constraints of present trials or of the Quantitative Analysis of Normal Tissue Effects in the Clinic (QUANTEC) trial is also unknown. Our study also explored the dosimetric benefits of intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT).  Methods and materials:   A total of 20 patients treated with postoperative RT were included. The three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) plans were applied to cover the guideline-generated planning target volumes (66 Gy in 33 fractions). Dose-volume histograms (DVHs) were analyzed for CTV/planning target volume coverage and to evaluate OAR irradiation. The OAR DVHs were compared with the constraints proposed in the QUANTEC and Radiotherapy and Androgen Deprivation In Combination After Local Surgery (RADICALS) trials. 3D-CRT plans were compared with the tomotherapy plans for the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group planning target volume to evaluate the advantages of IMRT.  Results:   The CTV differed significantly between guidelines (p < 0.001). The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer-CTVs were significantly smaller than the other CTVs (p < 0.001). Differences in prostate bed coverage superiorly accounted for the major volumetric differences between the guidelines. Using 3D-CRT, the DVHs rarely met the QUANTEC or RADICALS rectal constraints, independent of the guideline used. The RADICALS bladder constraints were met most often by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer consensus guideline (14 of 20). The tomotherapy IMRT plans resulted in significant OAR sparing compared with the 3D-CRT plans; however, the RADICALS and QUANTEC criteria were still missed in a large percentage of cases.  Conclusion:   Treatment volumes using the current consensus guidelines differ significantly. For the four CTV guidelines, the rectal and bladder DVH constraints proposed in the QUANTEC and RADICALS trials are rarely met with 3D-CRT. IMRT results in significant OAR sparing; however, the RADICALS dose constraints are still missed for a large percentage of cases. The rectal and bladder constraints of RADICALS should be modified to avoid a reduction in the CTVs.""","""['Shawn Malone', 'Jennifer Croke', 'Nicolas Roustan-Delatour', 'Eric Belanger', 'Leonard Avruch', 'Colin Malone', 'Christopher Morash', 'Cathleen Kayser', 'Kathryn Underhill', 'Yan Li', 'Kyle Malone', 'Balazs Nyiri', 'Johanna Spaans']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Proposal of a post-prostatectomy clinical target volume based on pre-operative MRI: volumetric and dosimetric comparison to the RTOG guidelines.', 'Anatomic variations due to radical prostatectomy.

Redox imbalance activates NF-E2 p45-related factor 2 (Nrf2), a transcription factor involved in cell protection and detoxification responses. Here we examined the involvement of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in the regulation of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) signaling by short exposure to α-TOS in prostate cancer cells. A short-term (4 h) exposure to α-TOS causes a significant reduction in cell viability (76%±9%) and a moderate rise in ROS production (113%±8%). α-TOS alters glutathione (GSH) homeostasis by inducing a biphasic effect, i.e., an early (1 h) decrease in intracellular GSH content (56%±20%) followed by a threefold rise at 4 h. α-TOS increases nuclear translocation and electrophile-responsive/antioxidant-responsive elements binding activity of Nrf2, resulting in up-regulation of downstream genes cystine-glutamic acid exchange transporter and HO-1, while decreasing NF-κB nuclear translocation. This effect is suppressed by the pharmacological inhibition of HO-1 and mimicked by the end-products of HO activity, i.e., bilirubin and carbon monoxide.

Results:   Although correlation was good for both TRUS and specimen volumes, they equally underestimated prostate weight with a large range of errors and poor concordance coefficients. Only 22% of TRUS volumes and 11% of calculated specimen volumes were within 10% of weight measurements. Application of a bullet-shaped mathematical model for prostates <55 g did not correct the large individual variation seen within these values.

Both methylation and deletion of GPx3 gene underlie the alterations of GPx3 expression in prostate cancer. A strong correlation between the down-regulation of GPx3 expression and progression of prostate cancer and the suppression of prostate cancer xenografts in SCID mice by forced expression of GPx3 suggests a tumor suppression role of GPx3 in prostate cancer. However, the mechanism of GPx3-mediated tumor suppression remains unclear. In this report, GPx3 was found to interact directly with p53-induced gene 3 (PIG3). Forced overexpression of GPx3 in prostate cancer cell lines DU145 and PC3 as well as immortalized prostate epithelial cells RWPE-1 increased apoptotic cell death. Expression of GPx3(x73c), a peroxidase-negative OPAL codon mutant, in DU145 and PC3 cells also increased cell death. The induced expression of GPx3 in DU145 and PC3 cells resulted in an increase in reactive oxygen species and caspase-3 activity. These activities were abrogated by either knocking down PIG3 or mutating the PIG3 binding motif in GPx3 or binding interference from a peptide corresponding to PIG3 binding motif in GPx3. In addition, UV-treated RWPE-1 cells underwent apoptotic death, which was partially prevented by knocking down GPx3 or PIG3, suggesting that GPx3-PIG3 signaling is critical for UV-induced apoptosis. Taken together, these results reveal a novel signaling pathway of GPx3-PIG3 in the regulation of cell death in prostate cancer.""","""['Hui Wang', 'Katherine Luo', 'Lang-Zhu Tan', 'Bao-Guo Ren', 'Li-Qun Gu', 'George Michalopoulos', 'Jian-Hua Luo', 'Yan P Yu']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""J Biol Chem""","""['Glutathione peroxidase 3, deleted or methylated in prostate cancer, suppresses prostate cancer growth and metastasis.', 'p53-inducible gene 3 promotes cell migration and invasion by activating the FAK/Src pathway in lung adenocarcinoma.', 'Identification of prohibitin and prohibiton as novel factors binding to the p53 induced gene 3 (PIG3) promoter (TGYCC)(15) motif.', 'BRCA1 regulates PIG3-mediated apoptosis in a p53-dependent manner.', 'PIG3: a novel link between oxidative stress and DNA damage response in cancer.', 'The Selenoprotein Glutathione Peroxidase 4: From Molecular Mechanisms to Novel Therapeutic Opportunities.', 'RNA sequencing of long-term label-retaining colon cancer stem cells identifies novel regulators of quiescence.', 'The NRF2, Thioredoxin, and Glutathione System in Tumorigenesis and Anticancer Therapies.', 'Honeybee products and edible insect powders improve locomotive and learning abilities of Ubiquilin-knockdown Drosophila.', 'Extracellular Glutathione Peroxidase GPx3 and Its Role in Cancer.']"""

In this study, we report that the treatment of LNCaP cells with epidermal growth factor (EGF) in the presence of LY294002, an inhibitor of the phosphoinositol 3'-kinase (PI3K)-AKT pathway, induced an increase of levels and activity of ErbB2. Under these conditions, we also observed cell survival and NE differentiation. When we treated with wortmannin, another PI3K inhibitor, or we knocked down PI3K or AKT isoforms in the presence of EGF, ErbB2 up-regulation was not observed, suggesting that the increase of ErbB2 induced by EGF plus LY294002 is not mediated by the PI3K-Akt pathway. Other targets of LY294002 were also discounted. We also show that ErbB2 up-regulation is directly involved in neuroendocine differentiation but not in cell survival as ErbB2 levels increased in parallel with NE differentiation marker levels, whereas ErbB2 knockdown reduced them; other NE differentiation inducers also increased the ErbB2 levels and the immunohistochemical analysis of prostate cancer samples showed colocalization of ErbB2 and chromogranin A. We found that, in LNCaP cells, EGF in combination with LY294002 increased ErbB2 levels by a PI3K/AKT-independent mechanism and that this increase was associated with the acquisition of a NE phenotype.

An important feature of these risk-associated SNPs is their weak individual effect but stronger cumulative effect on disease risk. To date, a stable summary estimate of the joint effect of genetic variants on disease risk prediction is not available. In this study, we propose to use the graded response model (GRM), which is based on the item response theory, for estimating the individual risk that is associated with a set of SNPs. We compare the GRM with a recently proposed risk prediction model called cumulative relative risk (CRR). Thirty-three prostate cancer risk-associated SNPs were originally discovered in GWAS by December 2009. These SNPs were used to evaluate the performance of GRM and CRR for predicting prostate cancer risk in three GWAS populations, including populations from Sweden, Johns Hopkins Hospital, and the National Cancer Institute Cancer Genetic Markers of Susceptibility study. Computational results show that the risk prediction estimates of GRM, compared to CRR, are less biased and more stable.""","""['Shyh-Huei Chen', 'Edward H Ip', 'Jianfeng Xu', 'Jielin Sun', 'Fang-Chi Hsu']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Hum Genet""","""['A systematic review of replication studies of prostate cancer susceptibility genetic variants in high-risk men originally identified from genome-wide association studies.', 'Cumulative effect of five genetic variants on prostate cancer risk in multiple study populations.', 'Association of prostate cancer risk with SNPs in regions containing androgen receptor binding sites captured by ChIP-On-chip analyses.', 'A genome-wide search for loci interacting with known prostate cancer risk-associated genetic variants.', 'Systematic enrichment analysis of potentially functional regions for 103 prostate cancer risk-associated loci.', 'Multigene panels in prostate cancer risk assessment: a systematic review.']"""

PTEN loss is considered to be a key event in prostate carcinogenesis but the mechanisms of loss remain to be fully elucidated. We hypothesised that gross rearrangements may exist that cause disruption of the PTEN gene in the absence of genomic deletion. We therefore designed a novel fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) assay with probes overlying regions 3' and 5' of PTEN and a third probe overlying the gene. We aimed to identify both genomic deletions and gross rearrangements of PTEN that would be overlooked by previously reported single-probe FISH assays. We proceeded to evaluate a tissue microarray with radical prostatectomy and trans-urethral resection of the prostate specimens from 187 patients. We identified PTEN genomic loss in 45/150 (30%) radical prostatectomy patients and 16/37 (43%) trans-urethral resection of the prostate patients. Importantly, our assay detected novel chromosomal alterations in the PTEN gene (characterised by splitting of FISH signals) in 13 tumours (6.9% of all prostate cancers; 21% of PTEN-lost cancers). All PTEN-rearranged tumours had genomic loss at the other allele and had no expression of PTEN by immunohistochemistry. PTEN-rearranged tumours were significantly more likely to have an underlying ERG rearrangement. Our assay differentiated loss of the probe overlying PTEN in isolation or in combination with either one of or both the probes overlying the 3' and 5' regions. This gave an indication of the size of genomic loss and we observed considerable inter-tumoural heterogeneity in the extent of genomic loss in PTEN-lost tumours. In summary, gross rearrangements of the PTEN locus occur in prostate cancer and can be detected by a 'break-apart' FISH assay. This observation could explain the absence of PTEN protein expression in a subgroup of tumours previously classified as having heterozygous genomic loss using single-probe traditional FISH assays.""","""['Alison H M Reid', 'Gerhardt Attard', 'Daniel Brewer', 'Susana Miranda', 'Ruth Riisnaes', 'Jeremy Clark', 'Lucy Hylands', 'Sue Merson', 'Roy Vergis', 'Charles Jameson', 'Søren Høyer', 'Karina Dalsgaard Sørenson', 'Michael Borre', 'Chris Jones', 'Johann S de Bono', 'Colin S Cooper']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Mod Pathol""","""['Integrated analysis of the genomic instability of PTEN in clinically insignificant and significant prostate cancer.', 'PTEN genomic deletion is an early event associated with ERG gene rearrangements in prostate cancer.', 'PTEN losses exhibit heterogeneity in multifocal prostatic adenocarcinoma and are associated with higher Gleason grade.', 'Association of ERG/PTEN status with biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy for clinically localized prostate cancer.', 'The prognostic and predictive value of TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion and ERG protein expression in prostate cancer biopsies.', 'An Insight on Novel Molecular Pathways in Metastatic Prostate Cancer: A Focus on DDR, MSI and AKT.', 'New Prognostic Biomarkers in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Docetaxel Treatment in PTEN- and ERG-aberrant Metastatic Prostate Cancers.', 'Clinical implications of PTEN loss in prostate cancer.', 'Appraising the relevance of DNA copy number loss and gain in prostate cancer using whole genome DNA sequence data.']"""

Although atrophy and inflammation may be precursors of prostate cancer, only HGPIN is currently recommended to be included in surgical pathology reports. To determine whether these benign findings increase prostate cancer risk, we conducted a case-control study nested within a historical cohort of 6692 men with a benign prostate specimen collected between 1990 and 2002. The analytic sample included 574 case-control pairs comprised of cases diagnosed with prostate cancer a minimum of 1 year after cohort entry and controls matched to cases on date and age at cohort entry, race, and type of specimen. The initial benign specimen was reviewed for presence of HGPIN, atrophy (simple, lobular, and partial) and inflammation (glandular and/or stromal). HGPIN significantly increased risk for prostate cancer (odds ratio (OR)=2.00; 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.25-3.20). Inflammation within the stromal compartment was associated with decreased risk (OR=0.66; CI=0.52-0.84), and diffuse stromal inflammation of severe grade had the strongest inverse association with risk (OR=0.21; CI=0.07-0.62). In a model adjusted for prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level at cohort entry and inflammation, simple atrophy was associated with a 33% increased prostate cancer risk that was marginally significant (P=0.03). Clinicians should consider patterns and extent of inflammation when managing high-risk patients with negative biopsy results. Identifying benign inflammatory processes that underlie high PSA levels would help to reduce the number of unnecessary repeated prostate biopsies.""","""['Oleksandr N Kryvenko', 'Michelle Jankowski', 'Dhananjay A Chitale', 'Deliang Tang', 'Andrew Rundle', 'Sheri Trudeau', 'Benjamin A Rybicki']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Mod Pathol""","""['Risk of prostate cancer after detection of isolated high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN) on extended core needle biopsy: a UK hospital experience.', 'High grade intraepithelial neoplasia of prostate is associated with values of prostate specific antigen related parameters intermediate between prostate cancer and normal levels.', 'The incidence of high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and atypical glands suspicious for carcinoma on first-time saturation needle biopsy, and the subsequent risk of cancer.', 'Prostate needle biopsies containing prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia or atypical foci suspicious for carcinoma: implications for patient care.', 'Prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia: a risk factor for prostate cancer.', 'Multifunctionality of Calebin A in inflammation, chronic diseases and cancer.', 'Biological mechanisms of aging predict age-related disease co-occurrence in patients.', 'Racial differences in the systemic inflammatory response to prostate cancer.', 'Growth and differentiation factor 15 and NF-κB expression in benign prostatic biopsies and risk of subsequent prostate cancer detection.', 'The interplay of growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) expression and M2 macrophages during prostate carcinogenesis.']"""

This year's report highlights the increased cancer risk associated with excess weight (overweight or obesity) and lack of sufficient physical activity (<150 minutes of physical activity per week).  Methods:   Data on cancer incidence were obtained from the CDC, NCI, and NAACCR; data on cancer deaths were obtained from the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics. Annual percent changes in incidence and death rates (age-standardized to the 2000 US population) for all cancers combined and for the leading cancers among men and among women were estimated by joinpoint analysis of long-term trends (incidence for 1992-2008 and mortality for 1975-2008) and short-term trends (1999-2008). Information was obtained from national surveys about the proportion of US children, adolescents, and adults who are overweight, obese, insufficiently physically active, or physically inactive.  Results:   Death rates from all cancers combined decreased from 1999 to 2008, continuing a decline that began in the early 1990s, among men and among women in most racial and ethnic groups. Death rates decreased from 1999 to 2008 for most cancer sites, including the 4 most common cancers (lung, colorectum, breast, and prostate). The incidence of prostate and colorectal cancers also decreased from 1999 to 2008. Lung cancer incidence declined from 1999 to 2008 among men and from 2004 to 2008 among women. Breast cancer incidence decreased from 1999 to 2004 but was stable from 2004 to 2008. Incidence increased for several cancers, including pancreas, kidney, and adenocarcinoma of the esophagus, which are associated with excess weight.  Conclusions:   Although improvements are reported in the US cancer burden, excess weight and lack of sufficient physical activity contribute to the increased incidence of many cancers, adversely affect quality of life for cancer survivors, and may worsen prognosis for several cancers.

Flow cytometry analysis of α- and γ-tocopherol-treated prostate carcinoma PC3 cells showed decreased progression into the S-phase. This effect, particularly evident for γ-tocopherol, was associated with an up-regulation and increased activity of transglutaminase 2 (TG2), a reduced DNA synthesis and a remarkable decreased levels of cyclin D1 and cyclin E. Activation of TG2 suggests that γ-tocopherol has an evident differentiative capacity on PC3 cells, leading to an increased expression of TG2, and reduced cyclin D1 and cyclin E levels, affecting cell cycle progression. It is feasible that up-regulation and activation of TG2, associated with a reduced proliferation, are parts of a large-scale reprogramming that can attenuate the malignant phenotype of PC3 cells in vitro.

Although the detection threshold for relapse after RP has steadily been lowered, only about 30% of the SRT patients achieve a durable response. We have previously shown the association between a PSA decrease below detectable levels after SRT and biochemical progression-free survival (BPFS). After recalculating our data according to a more recent definition of biochemical failure after SRT, we now show the significance of the post-RP PSA nadir.  Materials and methods:   Among 159 prostate cancer patients without hormonal treatment after RP, SRT was given to 72 patients with persistently detectable PSA after RP and to 87 whose PSA increased out of an undetectable range. The median pre-SRT PSA was 0.29 ng/ml for the former group and 0.34 ng/ml for the latter group. A radiation dose of 66.6 Gy was applied to the prostate bed.  Results:   The overall median follow-up time was 41.7 months. The probability for BPFS after this period was 52.8% in 72 patients with persistently detectable PSA after RP and 65.4% in 87 patients who had a post-RP PSA nadir below detection limit. Univariate and multivariate analyses showed no significant difference in BPFS of both patient groups (p > 0.05).

After excluding those with a history of BPH diagnosis or treatment, or an International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) ≥ 8 at study entry, 9253 men were available for analysis.

After allowing for multiple testing, none of the SNPs examined were significantly associated with growth factor or hormone concentrations, and the SNP-prostate cancer associations did not differ by these concentrations, although 4 interactions were marginally significant (MSMB-rs10993994 with androstenedione (uncorrected P = 0.008); CTBP2-rs4962416 with IGFBP-3 (uncorrected P = 0.003); 11q13.2-rs12418451 with IGF-1 (uncorrected P = 0.006); and 11q13.2-rs10896449 with SHBG (uncorrected P = 0.005)).

Here, depression and coping up to 8 years posttreatment are described for patients treated with (125)I brachytherapy for localized prostate cancer.  Methods and materials:   Between December 2000 and June 2010, 132 patients received questionnaires at: baseline, 1 month, 6 months, 1 year, and 8 years posttreatment. The measures included the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) and the Utrecht Coping List. Also general quality of life measures were used: the Short Form Health Survey (RAND-36), the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer C30 questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30+3) and a prostate cancer specific questionnaire (EORTC-PR25). Descriptive statistics were performed and correlations among depression, coping, and general quality of life measures were investigated.  Results:   At baseline and all follow-up moments, approximately 10% of the patients had a CES-D score of 16 or more, indicating a clinically significant level of depressive symptoms. Depression did not seem to change in time. Active coping was the most predominant style of coping in problem situations. Coping strategy did not change in time. No relevant correlations were found between coping and depression. No significant associations were found between CES-D mean score and patient characteristics (medical and demographic). Relevant negative correlations were found between depression and HRQOL variables vitality, emotional functioning, and mental health (ρ>0.5).

We therefore conducted a nationwide population-based Danish cohort study to evaluate whether a history of cutaneuos SCC has prognostic impact in patients with one of the following index cancers: non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), or cancer of the lung, colon, rectum, breast, or prostate.  Methods:   We used Danish medical databases, which cover the entire Danish population of 5.6 million inhabitants and linked them using the unique personal identification number assigned to all Danish residents. From 1982 through 2003, we identified 745 index cancer patients with and 79,143 without previous cutaneous SCC. Using Cox proportional hazards regression, we calculated adjusted mortality rate ratios (MRRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).  Results:   Overall, previous SCC was associated with an increased mortality of cancer (MRR 1.13, 95% CI: 1.04-1.23). When examining index cancers separately, increased MRRs were found for cancer of the lung (MRR 1.23, 95% CI: 1.05-1.43), colon (MRR 1.13, 95% CI: 0.92-1.40), rectum (MRR 1.29, 95% CI: 1.00-1.67), breast (MRR 1.09, 95% CI: 0.82-1.43), and NHL (MRR 1.09, 95% CI: 0.81-1.47), but not for prostate cancer (MRR 0.99, 95% CI: 0.83-1.18).

However, randomized controlled trials are needed to scientifically determine the effectiveness of strength training on the muscle cell level. Furthermore, close examination of the feasibility of a high-load strength training program is warranted. The Physical Exercise and Prostate Cancer (PEPC) trial is designed to determine the effectiveness of strength training on clinical and muscle cellular outcomes in non-metastatic prostate cancer patients after high-dose radiotherapy and during ongoing androgen deprivation therapy.  Methods/design:   Patients receiving androgen deprivation therapy for 9-36 months combined with external high-dose radiotherapy for locally advanced prostate cancer are randomized to an exercise intervention group that receives a 16 week high-load strength training program or a control group that is encouraged to maintain their habitual activity level. In both arms, androgen deprivation therapy is continued until the end of the intervention period.Clinical outcomes are body composition (lean body mass, bone mineral density and fat mass) measured by Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry, serological outcomes, physical functioning (muscle strength and cardio-respiratory fitness) assessed with physical tests and psycho-social functioning (mental health, fatigue and health-related quality of life) assessed by questionnaires. Muscle cellular outcomes are a) muscle fiber size b) regulators of muscle fiber size (number of myonuclei per muscle fiber, number of satellite cells per muscle fiber, number of satellite cells and myonuclei positive for androgen receptors and proteins involved in muscle protein degradation and muscle hypertrophy) and c) regulators of muscle fiber function such as proteins involved in cellular stress and mitochondrial function. Muscle cellular outcomes are measured on muscle cross sections and muscle homogenate from muscle biopsies obtained from muscle vastus lateralis.  Discussion:   The findings from the PEPC trial will provide new knowledge on the effects of high-load strength training on clinical and muscle cellular outcomes in prostate cancer patients during androgen deprivation therapy.

Background:   Prostate cancer incidence is increasing with the result that more men are living longer with the disease and the side effects of treatment. It is important to know the effects this has on their quality of life.  Design:   Survey.  Method:   Between September 2006-September 2007, all men who were about to undergo radical conformal radiotherapy ± neo-adjuvant androgen deprivation for localized prostate cancer were invited to participate in the study; 149 men were recruited. They completed the European Organization on Research and Treatment of Cancer quality of life questionnaire C-30 and Prostate Cancer module PR25 at four time-points.  Results:   At 4-6 weeks after radiotherapy, participants experienced the biggest relative decline in global quality of life, social, physical, and role functioning and an increase in treatment side effects. At 6 months postradiotherapy the majority of men experienced an improvement in their side effects. However, a minority of men were experiencing severe side effects of radiotherapy at 1 year post-treatment. Single men and men who had a low quality of life prior to radiotherapy, reported a lower quality of life at 1 year after treatment in comparison to married men.

Recently, microvesicles have appeared as a novel source for cancer biomarkers. We present here the results from a proteomic analysis of microvesicles released to the extracellular environment by the metastatic prostate cancer cell line PC-3. Using nanocapillary liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry 266 proteins were identified with two or more peptide sequences. Further analysis showed that 16% of the proteins were classified as extracellular and that intracellular proteins were annotated in a variety of locations. Concerning biological processes, the proteins found in PC-3 cell-released microvesicles are mainly involved in transport, cell organization and biogenesis, metabolic process, response to stimulus, and regulation of biological processes. Several of the proteins identified (tetraspanins, annexins, Rab proteins, integrins, heat shock proteins, cytoskeletal proteins, 14-3-3 proteins) have previously been found in microvesicles isolated from other sources. However, some of the proteins seem to be more specific to the vesicular population released by the metastatic prostate cancer PC-3 cell line. Among these proteins are the tetraspanin protein CD151 and the glycoprotein CUB domain-containing protein 1.

Aberrant Hedgehog signaling activation has been associated with prostate cancer aggressiveness. We hypothesize that Hedgehog pathway is a candidate therapeutic target in advanced prostate cancer. We confirm increased Hedgehog signaling in advanced and bone metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer and examine the pharmacodynamic effect of Smoothened inhibition by the novel reagent GDC-0449 in an experimental prostate cancer model.  Methods:   Hedgehog signaling component expression was assessed in tissue microarrays of high grade locally advanced and bone metastatic disease. Male SCID mice subcutaneously injected with the bone forming xenograft MDA PCa 118b were treated with GDC-0449. Hedgehog signaling in the tumor microenvironment was assessed by proteomic and species specific RNA expression and compared between GDC-0449 treated and untreated animals.  Results:   We observe Hedgehog signaling in high grade locally advanced and bone marrow infiltrating disease. Evidence of paracrine activation of Hedgehog signaling in the tumor xenograft, was provided by increased Sonic Hedgehog expression in human tumor epithelial cells, coupled with increased Gli1 and Patched1 expression in the murine stromal compartment, while normal murine stroma did not exhibit Hh signaling expression. GDC-0449 treatment attenuated Hh signaling as evidenced by reduced expression of Gli1 and Ptch1. Reduction in proliferation (Ki67) was observed with no change in tumor volume.

In this study, we evaluated the anticancer activity of calcitriol, the active form of vitamin D, dietary soy, and their combinations in a mouse model of PCa.  Methods:   Athymic male nude mice bearing PC-3 human PCa xenografts received diets containing 10 or 20 kcal% soy, calcitriol injections, or a combination of dietary soy and calcitriol. Changes in tumor growth, serum levels of 1,25(OH)(2)D and calcium, and regulation of tumor gene expression were examined.  Results:   The combination treatments resulted in substantially greater inhibition of tumor growth than either agent alone. Soy diets alone caused a modest elevation in serum 1,25(OH)(2)D, whereas the calcitriol-soy combinations led to substantially elevated serum 1,25(OH)(2) D, hypercalcemia, and in some cases lethal toxicity. The combinations enhanced calcitriol activity in regulating target gene expression, including greater up-regulation of anti-proliferative (p21, IGFBP-3) and pro-apoptotic (Bax) genes, increased inhibition of anti-apoptotic (Bcl-2) and cell cycle promoting (cyclin D1) genes, and suppression of prostaglandin (PG) synthesis and signaling (COX-2, 15-PGDH, PG receptors). Increases in serum calcium were accompanied by elevated expression of intestinal calcium absorption genes (TRPV6, calbindin-9k).  Conclusions:   Soy increases the bioavailability of endogenous and administered calcitriol, thereby enhancing its anticancer effects and risk of hypercalcemia. Since both agents are easily available as dietary supplements, the increased potential for hypercalcemic toxicity becomes an important factor when considering the combined use of vitamin D and soy in PCa therapy.""","""['Jennifer Y Wang', 'Srilatha Swami', 'Aruna V Krishnan', 'David Feldman']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Dietary vitamin D₃ and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D₃ (calcitriol) exhibit equivalent anticancer activity in mouse xenograft models of breast and prostate cancer.', 'Molecular pathways mediating the anti-inflammatory effects of calcitriol: implications for prostate cancer chemoprevention and treatment.', 'Novel pathways that contribute to the anti-proliferative and chemopreventive activities of calcitriol in prostate cancer.', 'Calcitriol and 20(S)-protopanaxadiol synergistically inhibit growth and induce apoptosis in human prostate cancer cells.', 'Equivalent anticancer activities of dietary vitamin D and calcitriol in an animal model of breast cancer: importance of mammary CYP27B1 for treatment and prevention.', 'ESS2 controls prostate cancer progression through recruitment of chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 1.', 'Vitamin D-Induced Molecular Mechanisms to Potentiate Cancer Therapy and to Reverse Drug-Resistance in Cancer Cells.', 'Transient Receptor Potential Cation Channels in Cancer Therapy.', 'Fine tuning of vitamin D receptor (VDR) activity by post-transcriptional and post-translational modifications.', 'Calcitriol in Combination Therapy for Prostate Cancer: Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Interactions.']"""

Research design and methods:   The study cohort consisted of 5,042 type 2 diabetic male patients seen in the Veteran Administration Health Care System who were without prior cancer and were prescribed with metformin or sulfonylurea as the exclusive hypoglycemic medication between fiscal years 1999 and 2005.

Results:   Mean follow-up was 5 years, and 7.5% had a PCa diagnosis. Statin use modified the effect of metformin on PCa incidence (P < 0.0001). Metformin was associated with a significantly reduced PCa incidence among patients on statins (HR 0.69 [95% CI 0.50-0.92]; 17 cases/533 metformin users vs. 135 cases/2,404 sulfonylureas users) and an increased PCa incidence among patients not on statins (HR 2.15 [1.83-2.52]; 22 cases/175 metformin users vs. 186 cases/1,930 sulfonylureas users). The HR of PCa incidence for those taking metformin and statins versus those taking neither medication was 0.32 (0.25-0.42).

The device has 64 individually addressable cell culture chambers in which cells can be cultured and exposed either sequentially or simultaneously to 64 pair-wise concentration combinations of two drugs. For sequential exposure, a simple microfluidic diffusive mixer is used to generate different concentrations of drugs from two inputs. For generation of 64 pair-wise combinations from two drug inputs, a novel time dependent variable concentration scheme is used in conjunction with the simple diffusive mixer to generate the desired combinations without the need for complex multi-layer structures or continuous medium perfusion. The generation of drug combinations and exposure to specific cell culture chambers are controlled using a LabVIEW interface capable of automatically running a multi-day drug screening experiment. Our cell array does not require continuous perfusion for keeping cells exposed to concentration gradients, minimizing the amount of drug used per experiment, and cells cultured in the chamber are not exposed to significant shear stress continuously. The utility of this platform is demonstrated for inducing loss of viability of PC3 prostate cancer cells using combinations of either doxorubicin or mitoxantrone with TRAIL (TNF-alpha Related Apoptosis Inducing Ligand) either in a sequential or simultaneous format.

Elucidation of the molecular mechanisms underlying the resistance for androgen deprivation in terms of the androgen receptor (AR)-regulated pathways is a requisite to manage castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Using a ChIP-cloning strategy, we identified functional AR binding sites (ARBS) in the genome of prostate cancer cells. We discovered that a centrosome- and microtubule-interacting gene, transforming acidic coiled-coil protein 2 (TACC2), is a novel androgen-regulated gene. We identified a functional AR-binding site (ARBS) including two canonical androgen response elements in the vicinity of TACC2 gene, in which activated hallmarks of histone modification were observed. Androgen-dependent TACC2 induction is regulated by AR, as confirmed by AR knockdown or its pharmacological inhibitor bicalutamide. Using long-term androgen-deprived cells as cellular models of CRPC, we demonstrated that TACC2 is highly expressed and contributes to hormone-refractory proliferation, as small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of TACC2 reduced cell growth and cell cycle progression. By contrast, in TACC2-overexpressing cells, an acceleration of the cell cycle was observed. In vivo tumor formation study of prostate cancer in castrated immunocompromised mice revealed that TACC2 is a tumor-promoting factor. Notably, the clinical significance of TACC2 was demonstrated by a correlation between high TACC2 expression and poor survival rates. Taken together with the critical roles of TACC2 in the cell cycle and the biology of prostate cancer, we infer that the molecule is a potential therapeutic target in CRPC as well as hormone-sensitive prostate cancer.""","""['Ken-ichi Takayama', 'Kuniko Horie-Inoue', 'Takashi Suzuki', 'Tomohiko Urano', 'Kazuhiro Ikeda', 'Tetsuya Fujimura', 'Satoru Takahashi', 'Yukio Homma', 'Yasuyoshi Ouchi', 'Satoshi Inoue']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Mol Endocrinol""","""['Editorial: Molecular Endocrinology articles in the spotlight for May 2012.', 'RhoA as a mediator of clinically relevant androgen action in prostate cancer cells.', 'Sox2 is an androgen receptor-repressed gene that promotes castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Androgen Receptor Regulation of Local Growth Hormone in Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Androgen receptor-dependent and -independent mechanisms driving prostate cancer progression: Opportunities for therapeutic targeting from multiple angles.', 'Androgen receptors in early and castration resistant prostate cancer: friend or foe?', 'The diagnostic yield, candidate genes, and pitfalls for a genetic study of intellectual disability in 118 middle eastern families.', 'Functional characterization of FBXL7 as a novel player in human cancers.', 'Nanopore sequencing reveals TACC2 locus complexity and diversity of isoforms transcribed from an intronic promoter.', 'TACC3 is a prognostic biomarker for kidney renal clear cell carcinoma and correlates with immune cell infiltration and T cell exhaustion.', 'Development of Prostate Cancer Organoid Culture Models in Basic Medicine and Translational Research.']"""

Genes that rely on SRF for androgen responsiveness represent a small fraction of androgen-regulated genes, but distinguish benign from malignant prostate, correlate with aggressive disease, and are associated with biochemical recurrence. Thus, understanding the mechanism(s) by which SRF conveys androgen regulation to its target genes may provide novel opportunities to target clinically relevant androgen signaling. Here, we show that the small GTPase ras homolog family member A (RhoA) mediates androgen-responsiveness of more than half of SRF target genes. Interference with expression of RhoA, activity of the RhoA effector Rho-associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase 1 (ROCK), and actin polymerization necessary for nuclear translocation of the SRF cofactor megakaryocytic acute leukemia (MAL) prevented full androgen regulation of SRF target genes. Androgen treatment induced RhoA activation, increased the nuclear content of MAL, and led to MAL recruitment to the promoter of the SRF target gene FHL2. In clinical specimens RhoA expression was higher in PCa cells than benign prostate cells, and elevated RhoA expression levels were associated with aggressive disease features and decreased disease-free survival after radical prostatectomy. Overexpression of RhoA markedly increased the androgen-responsiveness of select SRF target genes, in a manner that depends on its GTPase activity. The use of isogenic cell lines and a xenograft model that mimics the transition from androgen-stimulated to castration-recurrent PCa indicated that RhoA levels are not altered during disease progression, suggesting that RhoA expression levels in the primary tumor determine disease aggressiveness. Androgen-responsiveness of SRF target genes in castration-recurrent PCa cells continued to rely on AR, RhoA, SRF, and MAL and the presence of intact SRF binding sites. Silencing of RhoA, use of Rho-associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase 1 inhibitors, or an inhibitor of SRF-MAL interaction attenuated (androgen-regulated) cell viability and blunted PCa cell migration. Taken together, these studies demonstrate that the RhoA signaling axis mediates clinically relevant AR action in PCa.""","""['Lucy J Schmidt', 'Kelly Duncan', 'Neelu Yadav', 'Kevin M Regan', 'Alissa R Verone', 'Christine M Lohse', 'Elena A Pop', 'Kristopher Attwood', 'Gregory Wilding', 'James L Mohler', 'Thomas J Sebo', 'Donald J Tindall', 'Hannelore V Heemers']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Mol Endocrinol""","""['Editorial: Molecular Endocrinology articles in the spotlight for May 2012.', 'Identification of a RhoA- and SRF-dependent mechanism of androgen action that is associated with prostate cancer progression.', 'TACC2 is an androgen-responsive cell cycle regulator promoting androgen-mediated and castration-resistant growth of prostate cancer.', 'Protein Kinase N1 control of androgen-responsive serum response factor action provides rationale for novel prostate cancer treatment strategy.', 'Androgen action in the prostate gland.', 'Oxidative stress and androgen receptor signaling in the development and progression of castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'AR activates YAP/TAZ differentially in prostate cancer.', 'Glia maturation factor beta deficiency protects against diabetic osteoporosis by suppressing osteoclast hyperactivity.', 'Synergistic activation of genes promoting invasiveness by dual deprivation in oxygen and nutrients.', 'The NOGO receptor NgR2, a novel αVβ3 integrin effector, induces neuroendocrine differentiation in prostate cancer.', 'The Role of LIM Kinase in the Male Urogenital System.']"""

We found that the most effective compound, quinoline imidoselenocarbamate EI201, inhibits the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, which is persistently activated and contributes to malignant progression in various cancers. EI201 blocked the phosphorylation of AKT, mTOR and several of its downstream regulators (p70S6K and 4E-BP1) and ERK1/2 in PC-3, HT-29 and MCF-7 cells in vitro, inducing both autophagy and apoptosis. EI201 also contributes to the loss of maintenance of the selfrenewal and tumorigenic capacity of cancer stem cells (CSCs). 0.1 μmol/L EI201 triggered a reduction in size and number of tumorspheres in PC-3, HT-29 and MCF-7 cells and 4 μmol/L induced the elimination of almost all the tumorspheres in the three studied cell lines. In addition, EI201 suppressed almost 80% prostate tumor growth in vivo (p < 0.01) compared to controls at a relatively low dose (10 mg/kg) in a mouse xenograft model.

Here, we present a solid-phase permethylation-based total N-glycan quantitative method that includes N-glycan releasing, purification, and derivatization on a 96-well plate platform. The solid-phase neutralization enabled us to perform reliable absolute quantification of the acidic N-glycans as well as neutral N-glycans from model glycoproteins (i.e., chicken ovalbumin and porcine thyroglobulin) by only using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). Furthermore, low-abundance sialylated N-glycans from human serum prostate specific antigen (PSA), an extremely valuable prostate cancer marker, were initially quantified, and their chemical compositions were proposed.

We sought to determine the risk of developing SIC before and after other primary malignancies (PM) and the prognosis of patients with SIC, with and without another PM. We used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database to identify patients diagnosed with SICs between 1973 and 2007. Multiple primary-standardized incidence ratios were calculated as an approximation of relative risk (RR) to explore the association of SICs with metachronous malignancies. Survival analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier methods and Cox proportional-hazard models. Among 8331 patients with SICs, 2424 (29%) had another PM at some time. The most common sites were prostate (26.2%), breast (14.3%), colon (9.1%), lung/bronchus (6.3%), and bladder (5.3%). Overall, 67% of patients had a PM diagnosed before SIC (pre-SIC), 33% after SIC (post-SIC), and 8% had a PM both before and after SIC. Among the pre-SIC group, the risk of future SIC was increased after cancers of the small bowel (RR 11.86 (95% CI: 6.13-20.72)), esophagus (4.05 (1.10-10.36)), colon (1.39 (1.05-1.81)), kidney (1.93 (1.12-3.09)), prostate (1.38 (1.17-1.62)), and leukemia (2.15 (1.18-3.61)). Among the post-SIC group, there was an increased risk of future PM of the small bowel (8.78 (4.54-15.34)), liver (2.49 (1.08-4.91)), prostate (1.25 (1.0-1.53)), and thyroid (2.73 (1.10-5.62)). Compared to patients with only SIC, those with a PM pre-SIC had worse mean survival (57.9 vs 40.9 months, HR 1.55 (1.42-1.69), P<0.001). In conclusion, almost one-third of patients with SICs have an associated metachronous primary tumor.

Dietary vitamin D(3) inhibition of tumor growth was equivalent to administered calcitriol (0.025, 0.05, or 0.1 μg/mouse, three times a week). Both treatments equivalently inhibited PC-3 prostate cancer xenograft growth but to a lesser extent than the MCF-7 tumors. Calcitriol at 0.05 μg and 0.1 μg caused modest but statistically significant increases in serum calcium levels indicating that the dietary vitamin D(3) comparison was to a maximally safe calcitriol dose. Dietary vitamin D(3) did not increase serum calcium, demonstrating its safety at the concentration tested. The vitamin D(3) diet raised circulating 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D levels and did not alter CYP27B1 mRNA in the kidney but increased it in the tumors, suggesting that extrarenal sources including the tumors contributed to the elevated circulating 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D(3).

Materials and methods:   The immunoexpression of HPSE2 in normal and neoplastic cervical squamous epithelia was determined using a semiquantitative (SQ) method and an index of expression (IE) method, using Image Lab Software. A total of 230 cervical tissue samples were analyzed and segregated into the following diagnostic groups: normal (27.4%), cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 1 (CIN 1, 15.2%), CIN 2 (16.5%), CIN 3 (15.2%), and invasive neoplasia (25.7%). The mean HPSE2 expression in the normal group was significantly lower than that of the other groups individually or combined (p < .001, for all combinations). The immunoexpression via the SQ method was significantly greater in the CIN 3 group compared with that in the CIN 1 group (p = .02).

CA induced anti-proliferative effects in PC-3 cells in a concentration- and time-dependent manner, which was due to apoptotic induction as evident from flow-cytometry, DNA laddering and TUNEL assay. Apoptosis was associated with the activation of caspase-8, -9, -3 and -7, increase in Bax:Bcl-2 ratio, release of cytochrome-c and decrease in expression of inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) family of proteins. Apoptosis was attenuated upon pretreatment with specific inhibitors of caspase-8 (Z-IETD-fmk) and caspase-9 (Z-LEHD-fmk) suggesting the involvement of both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic cascades. Further, apoptosis resulted from the inhibition of IKK/NF-κB pathway as evident from decreased DNA binding activity, nuclear translocation of p50 and p65 and IκBα phosphorylation. The down-regulation of IKK/NF-κB was associated with inhibition of Akt phosphorylation and its kinase activity with a concomitant increase in the serine/threonine protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) activity. Pharmacologic inhibition of PP2A by okadaic acid and calyculin A, significantly reversed CA-mediated apoptotic events in PC-3 cells indicating that CA induced apoptosis by activation of PP2A through modulation of Akt/IKK/NF-κB pathway.

Topotecan Hydrochloride (Hycamtin) is an FDA-approved chemotherapy drug, primarily used for secondary treatment of ovarian, cervical and small cell lung cancers. This study was to demonstrate the potential anticancer efficacy of genistein-topotecan combination in LNCaP prostate cancer cells and the mechanism of the combination treatment. The LNCaP cells were grown in complete RPMI medium, and cultured at 37°C, 5% CO(2) for 24-48 hrs to achieve 70-90% confluency. The cells were treated with varying concentrations of genistein, topotecan and genistein-topotecan combination and incubated for 24 hrs. The treated cells were assayed for (i) post-treatment sensitivity using MTT assay and DNA fragmentation, (ii) treatment-induced apoptosis using caspase-3 and -9 binding assays and (iii) treatment-induced ROS generation levels. The overall data indicated that (i) both genistein and topotecan induce cellular death in LNCaP cells, (ii) genistein-topotecan combination was significantly more efficacious in reducing LNCaP cell viability compared with either genistein or topotecan alone, (iii) in all cases, cell death was primarily through apoptosis, via the activation of caspase-3 and -9, which are involved in the intrinsic pathway, (iv) ROS generation levels increased significantly with the genistein-topotecan combination treatment.

The aim of this study was to analyze the relationship between ERG expression, DNA methylation of three biomarkers, and clinicopathologic features of prostate cancer.  Experimental design:   Immunohistochemistry for ERG protein was conducted as a surrogate for TMPRSS2-ERG fusions. We analyzed methylation of CYP26A1, TBX15, and HOXD3 in 219 prostatectomy specimens by the quantitative MethyLight assay. DNA methylation was compared between ERG-positive and -negative cases and correlations of ERG and DNA methylation with clinicopathologic features were analyzed using χ(2), Spearman correlation, logistic regression, and Cox regression.  Results:   ERG expression varied according to Gleason pattern (almost absent in pattern II, highest in pattern III, and lower in pattern IV/V) and showed a strong positive correlation with methylation levels of CYP26A1, TBX15, and HOXD3 (Spearman P < 0.005). TBX15 and HOXD3 methylation were significantly associated with pathologic stage, Gleason score, and Gleason pattern (P ≤ 0.015). In multivariate regression analysis, PSA, TBX15 high methylation, and HOXD3 high methylation were significantly associated with stage (P < 0.05), whereas ERG expression was negatively correlated with Gleason score (P = 0.003). In univariate time-to-recurrence analysis, a combination of HOXD3/TBX15 high methylation predicted recurrence in ERG-positive and -negative cases (P < 0.05).

STAMPEDE--an international, open-label, randomised controlled trial--uses a novel multiarm, multistage design to assess whether the early additional use of one or two drugs (docetaxel, zoledronic acid, celecoxib, zoledronic acid and docetaxel, or zoledronic acid and celecoxib) improves survival in men starting first-line, long-term hormone therapy. Here, we report the preplanned, second intermediate analysis comparing hormone therapy plus celecoxib (arm D) with hormone therapy alone (control arm A).  Methods:   Eligible patients were men with newly diagnosed or rapidly relapsing prostate cancer who were starting long-term hormone therapy for the first time. Hormone therapy was given as standard care in all trial arms, with local radiotherapy encouraged for newly diagnosed patients without distant metastasis. Randomisation was done using minimisation with a random element across seven stratification factors. Patients randomly allocated to arm D received celecoxib 400 mg twice daily, given orally, until 1 year or disease progression (including prostate-specific antigen [PSA] failure). The intermediate outcome was failure-free survival (FFS) in three activity stages; the primary outcome was overall survival in a subsequent efficacy stage. Research arms were compared pairwise against the control arm on an intention-to-treat basis. Accrual of further patients was discontinued in any research arm showing safety concerns or insufficient evidence of activity (lack of benefit) compared with the control arm. The minimum targeted activity at the second intermediate activity stage was a hazard ratio (HR) of 0·92. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00268476, and with Current Controlled Trials, number ISRCTN78818544.  Findings:   2043 patients were enrolled in the trial from Oct 17, 2005, to Jan 31, 2011, of whom 584 were randomly allocated to receive hormone therapy alone (control group; arm A) and 291 to receive hormone therapy plus celecoxib (arm D). At the preplanned analysis of the second intermediate activity stage, with 305 FFS events (209 in arm A, 96 in arm D), there was no evidence of an advantage for hormone therapy plus celecoxib over hormone therapy alone: HR 0·94 (95% CI 0·74-1·20). [corrected]. 2-year FFS was 51% (95% CI 46-56) in arm A and 51% (95% CI 43-58) in arm D. There was no evidence of differences in the incidence of adverse events between groups (events of grade 3 or higher were noted at any time in 123 [23%, 95% CI 20-27] patients in arm A and 64 [25%, 19-30] in arm D). The most common grade 3-5 events adverse effects in both groups were endocrine disorders (55 [11%] of patients in arm A vs 19 [7%] in arm D) and musculoskeletal disorders (30 [6%] of patients in arm A vs 15 [6%] in arm D). The independent data monitoring committee recommended stopping accrual to both celecoxib-containing arms on grounds of lack of benefit and discontinuing celecoxib for patients currently on treatment, which was endorsed by the trial steering committee.  Interpretation:   Celecoxib 400 mg twice daily for up to 1 year is insufficiently active in patients starting hormone therapy for high-risk prostate cancer, and we do not recommend its use in this setting. Accrual continues seamlessly to the other research arms and follow-up of all arms will continue to assess effects on overall survival.

Here, we show that rapamycin activates Smads 1 and 5 in human prostate cancer cells and tissues through blocking mTORC1 kinase. Small hairpin RNA-based gene silencing and gene overexpression approaches reveal that Smads 1 and 5 mediate, whereas Smad8 represses, rapamycin-induced cell death and expression of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) transcriptional target Id1 in human prostate cancer cell lines. Moreover, such phospho-Smad1/5-mediated rapamycin responses were blocked by LDN-193189 (a BMPRI kinase inhibitor) or Noggin (a BMP antagonist) in LNCaP prostate cancer cells. Likewise, the mTOR kinase inhibitors Ku-0063794 and WYE-354 each enhanced phosphorylation of Smad1/5. Intriguingly, silencing raptor alone enhanced, whereas silencing rictor repressed, the phosphorylation of Smad1/5, indicating that mTORC1 represses, whereas mTORC2 activates, BMP signaling. Immunohistochemical analysis showed increased levels of phospho-Smad1/5 concomitant with suppression of phospho-S6 and survivin levels in PC3 human prostate cancer xenografts in athymic mice administered rapamycin (intraperitoneally, 5 mg/kg/d, 2-6 days). Moreover, we show that compared with prostate tumor tissue from untreated patients, levels of phospho-Smad1/5 were significantly elevated in the prostate tumor tissue of patients with high-risk prostate cancer who received 8 weeks of the rapalog everolimus as part of a neoadjuvant clinical trial before undergoing local definitive therapy by radical prostatectomy.

We therefore investigated whether quercetin, a natural inhibitor of catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT), will inhibit EGCG methylation leading to enhanced antiproliferative activity of EGCG in prostate cancer cells. Incubation with both quercetin and EGCG for 2 h increased the cellular concentrations of EGCG by 4- to 8-fold and 6- to 10-fold in androgen-independent PC-3 cells and androgen-dependent LNCaP cells, respectively. Concurrently, the percent of 4″-MeEGCG in the total EGCG was decreased from 39% to 15% in PC-3 cells and from 61% to 38% in LNCaP cells. Quercetin and EGCG in combination synergistically inhibited cell proliferation, caused cell cycle arrest, and induced apoptosis in PC-3 cells. In LNCaP cells, EGCG and quercetin exhibited a stronger antiproliferative activity leading to an additive effect. The synergistic effect of these 2 agents in PC-3 cells could be based on the fact that EGCG primarily inhibited COMT activity, whereas quercetin reduced the amount of COMT protein.

Material and methods:   From a consecutive series of men diagnosed with prostate cancer at transurethral resection in 1975-1990, tissue microarrays (TMAs) were constructed. A majority of men had no metastases at diagnosis and were followed by watchful waiting (n = 295). The TMAs were stained for Ki67, endoglin and factor VIII-related antigen (vWf).  Results:   In univariate Cox analyses, increased Ki67 index, endoglin vascular density and vWf vascular density were associated with shorter cancer-specific survival. Ki67 index and endoglin vascular density added independent prognostic information to clinical stage, estimated tumour size and Gleason score (GS) in multivariate Cox analysis. In GS 6 tumours, high Ki67 index and high endoglin vascular density identified patients with poor outcome. After 15 years of follow-up not a single man out of 34 men with low staining for both markers (35% of all GS 6 tumours) had died of prostate cancer, in contrast to 15 prostate cancer deaths among the remaining 63 men with GS 6 tumours (65% cumulative risk of prostate cancer death). vWf vascular density in benign areas was a prognostic marker in GS 6 and 7 tumours.

Protein inhibitor of activated signal transducers and activators of transcription (PIAS)1, a regulator of cytokine signaling, may be implicated in the modulation of cellular events during carcinogenesis. This study was designed to investigate the functional significance of PIAS1 in models of human prostate cancer. We demonstrate for the first time that PIAS1 protein expression is significantly higher in malignant areas of clinical prostate cancer specimens than in normal tissues, thus suggesting a growth-promoting role for PIAS1. Expression of PIAS1 was observed in the majority of tested prostate cancer cell lines. In addition, we investigated the mechanism by which PIAS1 might promote prostate cancer and found that down-regulation of PIAS1 leads to decreased proliferation and colony formation ability of prostate cancer cell lines. This decrease correlates with cell cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase, which is mediated by increased expression of p21(CIP1/WAF1). Furthermore, PIAS1 overexpression positively influences cell cycle progression and thereby stimulates proliferation, which can be mechanistically explained by a decrease in the levels of cellular p21.

Materials and methods:   Series of steroid derivatives having pure and potent antagonistic activity on the human and rodent AR were synthesized. Assays of AR binding and activity in carcinoma mouse Shionogi and human LNCaP cells as well as in vivo bioavailability measurements and in vivo prostate weight assays in the rat were used.  Results:   The chosen lead steroidal compound, namely EM-5854, has a 3.7-fold higher affinity than BICA for the human AR while EM-5855, an important metabolite of EM-5854, has a 94-fold higher affinity for the human AR compared to BICA. EM-5854 and EM-5855 are 14 times more potent than BICA in inhibiting androgen (R1881)-stimulated prostatic specific antigen (PSA) secretion in human prostatic carcinoma LNCaP cells in vitro. MDV3100 has a potency comparable to bicalutamide in these assays. Depending upon the oral formulation, EM-5854 is 5- to 10-times more potent than BICA to inhibit dihydrotestosterone (DHT)-stimulated ventral prostatic weight in vivo in the rat while MDV3100 has lower activity than BICA in this in vivo model. These data are supported by respective 40-fold and 105-fold higher potencies of EM-5854 and EM-5855 compared to BICA to inhibit cell proliferation in the androgen-sensitive Shionogi carcinoma cell model.  Conclusions:   Although the present preclinical results data need evaluation in clinical trials in men, combination of the data obtained in vitro in human LNCaP cells as indicator of potency in the human prostate and the data on metabolism evaluated in vivo on ventral prostate weight in the rat, could suggest the possibility of a 70- to 140-fold higher potency of EM-5854 compared to bicalutamide (Casodex) for the treatment of prostate cancer in men.""","""['Sylvain Gauthier', 'Céline Martel', 'Fernand Labrie']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""J Steroid Biochem Mol Biol""","""['Androgen receptor or estrogen receptor-beta blockade alters DHEA-, DHT-, and E(2)-induced proliferation and PSA production in human prostate cancer cells.', 'A novel steroidal antiandrogen targeting wild type and mutant androgen receptors.', 'Hormonal therapy of prostate cancer.', 'The development of Casodex (bicalutamide): preclinical studies.', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Resistance to second generation antiandrogens in prostate cancer: pathways and mechanisms.', 'Recent Advances in Drug Design and Drug Discovery for Androgen- Dependent Diseases.', 'Novel stably transfected human reporter cell line AIZ-AR as a tool for an assessment of human androgen receptor transcriptional activity.', 'Androgen receptors beyond prostate cancer: an old marker as a new target.', 'Synthesis and In vitro cytotoxic activity evaluation of (E)-16-(substituted benzylidene) derivatives of dehydroepiandrosterone.']"""

What's known on the subject? and What does the study add? Married individuals have lower morbidity and mortality rates for all major causes of death. Cancer-specific survival is better in married patients with testis cancer, prostate cancer, breast cancer, cervical cancer, as well as head and neck cancers. We have found the effect of marital status on outcomes after radical cystectomy to be variable, depending on gender and the outcome addressed. Being married is predictive of lower all-cause mortality for both men and women relative to their separated, divorced or widowed (SDW) or never-married counterparts. It is also predictive of lower bladder-cancer-specific mortality relative to SDW individuals. Marriage also exerts a protective effect on men regarding non-organ-confined disease, with those never having married having significantly higher rates.  Objectives:   • To examine the effect of marital status (MS) on the rate of non-organ-confined disease (NOCD) at radical cystectomy (RC) • To assess the effect of MS on the rate of bladder-cancer-specific mortality (BCSM) and all-cause mortality (ACM) after RC for urothelial carcinoma of the urinary bladder (UCUB).  Materials and methods:   • A total of 14 859 patients, who underwent RC for UCUB, were captured within the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database, between 1988 and 2006. • Logistic regression analysis was used to assess the rate of NOCD (T(3-4) /N(I-3) /M(0) ) at RC and Cox regression analyses were used to assess BCSM and ACM. • Analyses were stratified according to gender; covariates included socio-economic status, tumour stage, age, race, tumour grade and year of surgery.  Results:   • Never-married males had a higher rate of NOCD at RC (odds ratio = 1.22, P= 0.004), an effect not found in never-married females. • Separated, divorced or widowed (SDW) males (hazard ratio [HR]= 1.18, P= 0.005) and females (HR = 1.16, P= 0.002) had higher rates of BCSM than their married counterparts. • SDW and never-married males had higher rates of ACM than their married counterparts (HR = 1.22, P < 0.001 and HR = 1.26, P < 0.001, respectively). • SDW and never-married females also had higher rates of ACM than married females (HR = 1.24, P < 0.001 and HR = 1.22, P= 0.01, respectively).

Materials and methods:   Men treated with exclusive permanent 125I seed brachytherapy from November 1999, with at least a 36 months follow-up were included. Bounce was defined as an increase ≥ 0.2 ng/ml above the nadir, followed by a spontaneous return to the nadir. Biochemical failure (BF) was defined using the criteria of the Phoenix conference: nadir +2 ng/ml.  Results:   198 men were included. After a median follow-up of 63.9 months, 21 patients experienced a BF, and 35.9% had at least one bounce which occurred after a median period of 17 months after implantation (4-50). Bounce amplitude was 0.6 ng/ml (0.2-5.1), and duration was 13.6 months (4.0-44.9). In 12.5%, bounce magnitude exceeded the threshold defining BF. Age at the time of treatment and high PSA level assessed at 6 weeks were significantly correlated with bounce but not with BF. Bounce patients had a higher BF free survival than the others (100% versus 92%, p = 0,007). In case of PSA increase, PSA doubling time and velocity were not significantly different between bounce and BF patients. Bounces occurred significantly earlier than relapses and than nadir + 0.2 ng/ml in BF patients (17 vs 27.8 months, p < 0.0001).

Sodium pump regulation is tissue as well as isoform specific. Intracellular messengers differentially regulate the activity of the individual NKA isozymes. Regulation of specific NKA isozymes gives cells the ability to precisely coordinate NKA activity to their physiological requirements. It is the only known receptor for the cardiac glycosides used to treat congestive heart failure and cardiac arrhythmias. Endogenous ligands structurally similar to cardiac glycosides may act as natural regulators of the sodium pump in heart and other tissues. Identification of naturally occurring regulators of NKA could initiate the discovery of new hormone-like control systems involved in the etiology of selected disease processes, hence the importance of understanding the relation of the sodium pump and its ligands to disease. Diabetes has a marked effect on the metabolism of a variety of tissues and because the NKA is critical for the membrane potential and many transports, a change in its activity in diabetes would have profound consequence in these tissues. NKA is also involved in hypertension, salt balance, cardiovascular and renal disorders, sperm capacitation, cell volume regulation, apoptosis, rheumatoid arthritis, sepsis, neurological disorders, lung edema clearance and preeclampsia. NKA activity and expression in the collecting duct of kidney are modulated physiologically by hormones like aldosterone, vasopressin, and insulin. NKA enzyme activity and subunit levels are reduced in carcinoma, NKA-β levels were highly reduced in an invasive form of human renal clear cell carcinoma, androgen-dependent prostate cancer, in early stages of urothelial cancer, as well as in poorly differentiated, highly motile carcinoma cell lines obtained from various tissues suggesting a functional link between reduced NKA-β expression and cancer progression. It could be a target for the development of anticancer drugs as it serves as a signal transducer, it is a player in cell adhesion and its aberrant expression and activity are implicated in the development and progression of different cancers.
