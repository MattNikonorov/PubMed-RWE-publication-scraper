CD11b(+) S100A9 expressing cells were not observed in normal prostate tissue from control C57BL/6 mice but were readily detected in TRAMP prostate tumors. Also, S100A9 expression was observed in association with CD68(+) macrophages in biopsies from human prostate tumors. Delayed growth of TRAMP tumors was also observed in mice lacking the S100A9 ligand TLR4. In the EL-4 lymphoma model tumor growth inhibition was observed in S100A9(-/-) and TLR4(-/-), but not in RAGE(-/-) animals lacking an alternative S100A9 receptor. When expression of immune-regulating genes was analyzed using RT-PCR the only common change observed in mice lacking S100A9 and TLR4 was a down-regulation of TGFβ expression in splenic CD11b(+) cells. Lastly, treatment of mice with a small molecule (ABR-215050) that inhibits S100A9 binding to TLR4 inhibited EL4 tumor growth. Thus, S100A9 and TLR4 appear to be involved in promoting tumor growth in two different tumor models and pharmacological inhibition of S100A9-TLR4 interactions is a novel and promising target for anti-tumor therapies.""","""['Eva Källberg', 'Thomas Vogl', 'David Liberg', 'Anders Olsson', 'Per Björk', 'Pernilla Wikström', 'Anders Bergh', 'Johannes Roth', 'Fredrik Ivars', 'Tomas Leanderson']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Common interactions between S100A4 and S100A9 defined by a novel chemical probe.', 'S100A9 induces differentiation of acute myeloid leukemia cells through TLR4.', ""CD68 on rat macrophages binds tightly to S100A8 and S100A9 and helps to regulate the cells' immune functions."", 'The endogenous Toll-like receptor 4 agonist S100A8/S100A9 (calprotectin) as innate amplifier of infection, autoimmunity, and cancer.', 'Review of S100A9 biology and its role in cancer.', 'Current progress on innate immune evasion mediated by Npro protein of pestiviruses.', 'Kidney stone matrix proteins: Role in stone formation.', 'S100A8/S100A9 Promote Progression of Multiple Myeloma via Expansion of Megakaryocytes.', 'Neutrophil S100A9 supports M2 macrophage niche formation in granulomas.', 'Decreased S100A9 expression alleviates Clostridium perfringens beta2 toxin-induced inflammatory injury in IPEC-J2 cells.']"""

The objective of this study was to obtain additional insights into the mechanisms involved in BP induced cell death in human prostate cancer cells.  Methods/principal findings:   Two human prostate cancer cell lines, PC-3 and LNCaP, were treated with BP, and subsequently evaluated for their viability and cell cycle profiles. BP caused cell cycle arrest and cell death in both cell lines. The G0/G1 phase arrest was correlated with increase levels of CDK inhibitors (p16, p21 and p27) and decrease of the checkpoint proteins. To determine the mechanisms of BP-induced growth arrest and cell death in prostate cancer cell lines, we performed a microarray study to identify alterations in gene expression induced by BP in the LNCaP cells. Several BP-induced genes, including the GADD153/CHOP, an endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER stress)-regulated gene, were identified. BP-induced ER stress was evidenced by increased expression of the downstream molecules GRP78/BiP, IRE1-α and GADD153/CHOP in both cell lines. Blockage of IRE1-α or GADD153/CHOP expression by siRNA significantly reduced BP-induced cell death in LNCaP cells. Furthermore, blockage of JNK1/2 signaling by JNK siRNA resulted in decreased expression of IRE1-α and GADD153/CHOP genes, implicating that BP-induced ER stress may be elicited via JNK1/2 signaling in prostate cancer cells. BP also suppressed LNCaP xenograft tumor growth in NOD-SCID mice. It caused 68% reduction in tumor volume after 18 days of treatment.  Conclusions:   Our results suggest that BP can cause G0/G1 phase arrest in prostate cancer cells and its cytotoxicity is mediated by ER stress induction. Thus, BP may serve as an anticancer agent by inducing ER stress in prostate cancer.""","""['Sheng-Chun Chiu', 'Shee-Ping Chen', 'Sung-Ying Huang', 'Mei-Jen Wang', 'Shinn-Zong Lin', 'Horng-Jyh Harn', 'Cheng-Yoong Pang']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Tanshinone IIA inhibits human prostate cancer cells growth by induction of endoplasmic reticulum stress in vitro and in vivo.', 'Proteomic-based identification of multiple pathways underlying n-butylidenephthalide-induced apoptosis in LNCaP human prostate cancer cells.', 'Dienogest regulates apoptosis, proliferation, and invasiveness of endometriotic cyst stromal cells via endoplasmic reticulum stress induction.', 'Role of endoplasmic reticulum stress in atherosclerosis and diabetic macrovascular complications.', 'Endoplasmic reticulum stress in doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity may be therapeutically targeted by natural and chemical compounds: A review.', 'The endoplasmic reticulum stress response in prostate cancer.', 'Improved Delivery Performance of n-Butylidenephthalide-Polyethylene Glycol-Gold Nanoparticles Efficient for Enhanced Anti-Cancer Activity in Brain Tumor.', 'A perspective on therapies for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: can disease progression be curbed?', 'Enhancement of cytotoxicity and induction of apoptosis by cationic nano-liposome formulation of n-butylidenephthalide in breast cancer cells.', 'n-Butylidenephthalide Modulates Autophagy to Ameliorate Neuropathological Progress of Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 3 through mTOR Pathway.']"""

One study in nude mice injected via tail vein with hepatocarcinoma SK-Hep-1 cells showed that BC decreases the plasma VEGF level, whereas the other study in nude mice injected subcutaneously with prostate tumor PC-3 cells showed that BC increases the plasma VEGF level. Herein we investigated whether BC (0.5-20 μM) possesses diverse effects on VEGF secretion in SK-Hep-1, PC-3 and melanoma B16F10 cells. We found that incubation of SK-Hep-1 cells with BC (1-20 μM) for 6 h significantly decreased VEGF secretion, whereas BC (1-10 μM) significantly increased the VEGF secretion in PC-3 cells. However, these effects disappeared at 12 h of incubation. Similar effects occurred in VEGF mRNA and protein expression after treatment of SK-Hep-1 and PC-3 cells with BC for 6 h. In contrast, BC (0.5-20 μM) did not affect mRNA and protein expression and secretion of VEGF in B16F10 cells. We also found that the proliferation of SK-Hep-1 and B16F10 cells was significantly inhibited by 20 μM BC at 6 and 12 h of incubation, whereas the proliferation of PC-3 cells was significantly inhibited by 20 μM BC at 12 h of incubation.

Methods:   During 2008-2011, 8 adult patients underwent CCD; 4 had classical exstrophy, 2 bladder cancer, 1 recurrent vaginal cancer post-radiotherapy, and 1 prostate cancer with post-simple retropubic prostatectomy urethral stricture with incontinence. For reconstruction, a 45- to 50-cm segment of terminal ileum sparing 25 cm of terminal ileum was harvested. Its distal 3- to 6-cm and proximal 3-cm segments were separated on vascular pedicle and fashioned into Yang-Monti tubes (1 proximally and 1 or 2 distally). The middle 40- to 45-cm detubularized segment was fashioned into a ""W"" shape, and serosal aspects of adjacent loops were sutured together close to the mesentery. The tubes were implanted into the W pouch via extramural serosa-lined tunnel (Abol-Enein and Ghoneim). The pouch was closed transversely over an 18-Fr pouchostomy and 16-Fr stomal catheter. The ureters were implanted into the proximal tube using the Wallace principle, over 6- to 8-Fr infant feeding tubes exteriorized through the pouch. The distal end of the distal tube was made into a flush stoma.  Results:   In the early postoperative period, intestinal obstruction (2 cases), ureteroileal anastomotic leakage (3 cases) and vesico-ileocutaneous fistula (1 case) were encountered. No ureteroileal anastomotic obstruction or catherization-related difficulty was observed until the last follow-up (2 months to 3 years). Of 15 anastomoses, 14 were nonrefluxing.  Conclusion:   Ileal double-T CCD using the Yang-Monti principle is technically feasible and relatively simple, particularly in nonirradiated ileum.

Methods:   From 1999 to 2008, 36 699 radical prostatectomy procedures were performed in Florida. First, logistic regression models predicting the RL rate were fitted. Second, other logistic regression models were used to examine the association between RL and 2 other secondary outcomes: prolonged length of stay (>3 days) and increased hospital charges (>$37 621). The covariates included APV quintiles, surgical approach (minimally invasive vs open radical prostatectomy), lymph node dissection status, age, year of surgery, race, and baseline Charlson comorbidity index.  Results:   The overall RL rate was 0.7%. The RL rate was 0.3%, 0.6%, 0.7%, 0.9%, and 1.0% for the very high, high, intermediate, low, and very low APV quintiles, respectively (P < .001).

The contribution of periprostatic adipose tissue, which is often infiltrated by malignant cells, to cancer progression is largely unknown. Thus, this study aimed to determine if periprostatic adipose tissue is linked with aggressive tumor biology in prostate cancer.  Methods:   Supernatants of whole adipose tissue (explants) or stromal vascular fraction (SVF) from paired fat samples of periprostatic (PP) and pre-peritoneal visceral (VIS) anatomic origin from different donors were prepared and analyzed for matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) 2 and 9 activity. The effects of those conditioned media (CM) on growth and migration of hormone-refractory (PC-3) and hormone-sensitive (LNCaP) prostate cancer cells were measured.  Results:   We show here that PP adipose tissue of overweight men has higher MMP9 activity in comparison with normal subjects. The observed increased activities of both MMP2 and MMP9 in PP whole adipose tissue explants, likely reveal the contribution of adipocytes plus stromal-vascular fraction (SVF) as opposed to SVF alone. MMP2 activity was higher for PP when compared to VIS adipose tissue. When PC-3 cells were stimulated with CM from PP adipose tissue explants, increased proliferative and migratory capacities were observed, but not in the presence of SVF. Conversely, when LNCaP cells were stimulated with PP explants CM, we found enhanced motility despite the inhibition of proliferation, whereas CM derived from SVF increased both cell proliferation and motility. Explants culture and using adipose tissue of PP origin are most effective in promoting proliferation and migration of PC-3 cells, as respectively compared with SVF culture and using adipose tissue of VIS origin. In LNCaP cells, while explants CM cause increased migration compared to SVF, the use of PP adipose tissue to generate CM result in the increase of both cellular proliferation and migration.  Conclusions:   Our findings suggest that the PP depot has the potential to modulate extra-prostatic tumor cells' microenvironment through increased MMPs activity and to promote prostate cancer cell survival and migration.

In this study, we have evaluated the effects and potential mechanisms of Sox2 on cell proliferation and apoptosis, and investigated effects of TGF-α on expression of Sox2 on androgen-independent human prostate cancer cells.  Materials and methods:   Expression of Sox2 has been determined by RT-PCR, western blot analysis and immunocytochemistry, using RNAi and over-expression strategy to study functions of Sox2 in DU145 and PC-3 cells. Changes in level of proliferation, cell cycle and apoptosis profiles were measured by MTT, colony-forming, bromodeoxyuridine incorporation assays, cell cycle and annexin V analysis.  Results:   Sox2 was expressed in six human prostate cancer cell lines, and its inhibition reduced cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in DU145 cells. We have shown that knock-down of Sox2 inhibited G(1) to S phase transition concomitantly with down-regulation of cyclin E and up-regulation of p27 proteins. Conversely, over-expression of Sox2 led to the opposite effect in PC-3 cells but its inhibition induced apoptosis by down-regulation of survivin in DU145 cells. We also found that TGF-α up-regulated Sox2 and survivin protein expression via the EGFR/PI3K/AKT pathway.

Materials and methods:   The study included 982 consecutive men with intermediate risk PCa (PSA 10–20 ng/ml or cT2b-c or biopsy Gleason 3 + 4/ 4 + 3) treated with ePLND and radical prostatectomy (RP) at a single center. All patients underwent an anatomically defined ePLND. A novel risk stratification tool was developed by applying the nonparametric tree modeling technique of classification and regression tree analysis (CART) which relied on pre-operative PSA, clinical stage, biopsy Gleason score, and percentage of positive cores. The area under the receiver characteristic curve (AUC) method was used to quantify the accuracy of the model.  Results:   Lymph node invasion (LNI) was found in 81 (8.2%) patients.

A fine-mapping analysis with tag SNPs in the cancer genetic markers of susceptibility study identified three independent loci, marked by rs10896438, rs12793759, and rs10896449. This study further annotates common and uncommon variation across this region.  Methods:   A next generation resequence analysis of a 122.9-kb region of 11q13.3(68,642,755-68,765,690) was conducted in 78 unrelated individuals of European background,1 CEPH trio, and 1 YRI trio.  Results:   In total, 644 polymorphic loci were identified by our sequence analysis. Of these,166 variants—118 SNPs and 48 insertion-deletion polymorphisms (indels)—were novel,namely not present in the 1000 Genomes or International HapMap Projects. We identified 22,25, 6, and 4 variants strongly correlated (r2 ≥ 0.8) with rs10896438, rs10896449, rs12793759,and rs11228565, respectively.

Differences in methylation patterns between neoplastic and normal cells can be used to detect the presence of cancer. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the usefulness of glutathione-S-transferase-Pi (GSTP1) hypermethylation in discriminating between normal and prostate cancer (PCa) cells and in predicting tumor characteristics by use of quantitative pyrosequencing analysis.  Materials and methods:   A total of 100 human prostate tissues obtained from our institute were used in this study: 45 for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and 55 for PCa. The methylation level of GSTP1 was examined by a quantitative pyrosequencing analysis. The associations between GSTP1 methylation level and clinico-pathological parameter were also compared.  Results:   The level of GSTP1 methylation was significantly higher in PCa samples than in BPH samples (56.7±32.7% vs. 1.6±2.2%, p<0.001). The sensitivity and specificity of GSTP1 methylation status in discriminating between PCa and BPH reached 85.5% and 100%, respectively. Even after stratification by stage, Gleason score, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, similar results were obtained. A positive correlation between GSTP1 methylation level and serum PSA level was observed (r=0.303, p=0.002). There were no associations between GSTP1 methylation level and age, Gleason score, and staging.

Ezrin and moesin have been implicated in cell polarization and cell migration, but little is known about the involvement of radixin in these processes. Here we show that radixin is required for migration of PC3 prostate cancer cells, and that radixin, but not ezrin or moesin, depletion by RNA interference increases cell spread area and cell-cell adhesion mediated by adherens junctions. Radixin depletion also alters actin organization, and distribution of active phosphorylated ezrin and moesin. Similar effects were observed in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. The phenotype of radixin-depleted cells is similar to that induced by constitutively active Rac1, and Rac1 is required for the radixin knockdown phenotype. Radixin depletion also increases the activity of Rac1 but not Cdc42 or RhoA. Analysis of Rac guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) suggests that radixin affects the activity of Vav GEFs. Indeed, Vav GEF depletion reverses the phenotype of radixin knockdown and reduces the effect of radixin knockdown on Rac1 activity. Our results indicate that radixin plays an important role in promoting cell migration by regulating Rac1-mediated epithelial polarity and formation of adherens junctions through Vav GEFs.""","""['Ferran Valderrama', 'Subangi Thevapala', 'Anne J Ridley']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""J Cell Sci""","""['MEK/ERK regulates adherens junctions and migration through Rac1.', 'Differential involvement of ezrin/radixin/moesin proteins in sphingosine 1-phosphate-induced human pulmonary endothelial cell barrier enhancement.', 'ERM stable knockdown by siRNA reduced in vitro migration and invasion of human SGC-7901 cells.', 'Ezrin/radixin/moesin: versatile controllers of signaling molecules and of the cortical cytoskeleton.', 'ERM Proteins at the Crossroad of Leukocyte Polarization, Migration and Intercellular Adhesion.', 'A biophysical perspective of the regulatory mechanisms of ezrin/radixin/moesin proteins.', 'Gα13 Contributes to LPS-Induced Morphological Alterations and Affects Migration of Microglia.', 'MiR-19b-3p and miR-101-3p as potential biomarkers for prostate cancer diagnosis and prognosis.', 'Unraveling the surface glycoprotein interaction network by integrating chemical crosslinking with MS-based proteomics.', 'ARHGEF10L Promotes Cervical Tumorigenesis via RhoA-Mediated Signaling.']"""

Here, a potential role of AGR2 in cellular senescence was investigated. We first observed that AGR2 was overexpressed in Chinese Han PCa tissues and had a positive correlation with cyclin D1 and p-Rb but not with p16(INK4a). AGR2 expression profiles varied among cell lines, with PC3 cells being the highest level, LNCaP and DU145 relatively less. The expression of cyclin D1 showed similar pattern to the AGR2 in cell lines. Knockdown of AGR2 caused a decrease in cell viability in PC3 cells, whereas forced expression of AGR2 led to an increased cell proliferation of LNCaP and DU145 cells. Importantly, AGR2 depletion resulted in accumulation of cells at the G(0)/G(1) phase and induction of cellular senescence in all three PCa cell lines as indicated by an increase of flat, enlarged and senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-Gal) positive cells. Senescent response to AGR2 silencing was also evidenced by elevated γH2AX and fluorescent punctuate formation of tri-methyl-histone H3 in AGR2-depleted cells. Further studies indicated that LNCaP underwent a p21(CIP1)-dependent cellular senescence in response to AGR2 depletion that requires inactivation of ERK signaling, whereas PC-3 was also p21(CIP1) dependent but involved in suppression of PI3K/Akt. Unlike LNCaP and PC-3, senescent response of DU145 was found to be mainly p27(KIP1) dependent that may require upregulation of PTEN and inhibition of PI3K/Akt signaling.

Unlike most previous reports based on correlative techniques, we found using direct bisulfite sequencing of Polycomb H3K27me3-enriched DNA from normal and prostate cancer cells that DNA methylation and H3K27me3-marked histones are not always mutually exclusive, but can co-occur in a genomic region-dependent manner. Notably, in cancer, the co-dependency of marks is largely redistributed with an increase of the dual repressive marks at CpG islands and transcription start sites of silent genes. In contrast, there is a loss of DNA methylation in intergenic H3K27me3-marked regions. Allele-specific methylation status derived from the BisChIP-seq data clearly showed that both methylated and unmethylated alleles can simultaneously be associated with H3K27me3 histones, highlighting that DNA methylation status in these regions is not dependent on Polycomb chromatin status.

Because TFs classically function within the cells that produce them, Nkx3.1-induced growth inhibition was considered to occur in a cell-autonomous manner. We, however, found that Nkx3.1 protein can be secreted from cultured PECs and is detectable in the prostatic fluid and urine. A PCa-related point mutation (T164A) abolished Nkx3.1 secretion. Amazingly, secreted Nkx3.1 protein can translocate into adjacent cells, bind to the regulatory sequence of Nkx3.1 target genes and impact the expression of these genes in these adjacent cells. Expression of Nkx3.1 in PECs can also affect gene expression in adjacent cells, and this effect is abolished by the T164A mutation. Nkx3.1 protein inhibits cell proliferation when added to the culture. Expression of Nkx3.1, not the T164A mutant, also inhibits the proliferation of co-cultured cells. These results indicate that Nkx3.1 functions as a ""para-transcription factor (PTF),"" with the ability to regulate genes and inhibit cell proliferation in a non-cell autonomous manner. We also demonstrate that Nkx3.1 contains an evolutionarily conserved protein transduction domain essential for its PTF function, implicating potentially common PTF function among homeoproteins. In addition to the PCa-related T164A mutant, the secreted Nkx3.1 is reduced drastically in the prostatic fluid and urine of mice with PCa.

The aim of this study was to determine the effect of hypoxia in patients with prostate cancer treated with radiotherapy.  Experimental design:   Tumor hypoxia was measured in 247 patients with clinically localized prostate cancer before radiotherapy, with or without hormonal therapy. The median pO(2) was 6.8 mm Hg and the median hypoxic percentage less than 10 mm Hg (HP(10)) was 63%. The median follow-up was 6.6 years.  Results:   The 5-year biochemical relapse-free rate (bRFR) was 78%. Prostrate-specific antigen and Gleason score were both associated with biochemical relapse and formed a baseline clinical model. The effect of hypoxia was found to vary with the duration of patient follow-up. HP(10), when added to the clinical model, was an independent predictor of early bRFR (P = 0.019). The relationship between hypoxia and early bRFR was more pronounced when the analysis was restricted to 142 patients with bulk tumor at the site of the oxygen measurements (P = 0.004).

In an attempt to unveil the molecular determinants that lye at the root of their different biological effects, here we investigate the interactions of the two resveratrol derivatives with DMPC model membranes by using DSC, membrane permeation/poration assays and molecular dynamics. The results show that the 3-O-derivative interacts with DMPC membranes and diffuses across them. The 4'-O-derivative lies preferentially onto the surface of membrane. The MD simulations provide a molecular interpretation of the experiments and highlight that, in order to maximize the apolar interactions, the 3-O-derivative is embedded in the lipid hydrophobic region. This topographical position of the 3-O resveratrol analog perturbs the liquid-crystalline order of the lipid bilayer promoting membrane curvature and partial lipid loss from the vesicle. This finding reconciles with the lowering of the enthalpy of the lipid phase transition and the ability of the molecule to diffuse across membranes. The present data contribute to explain the different biological activity of the two molecules and evidence that membrane permeability is a key requirement for effective design of resveratrol derivatives to be used for therapeutic purposes.""","""['Michele F M Sciacca', 'Rosa Chillemi', 'Sebastiano Sciuto', 'Matteo Pappalardo', 'Carmelo La Rosa', 'Domenico Grasso', 'Danilo Milardi']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Arch Biochem Biophys""","""['Interaction of the chemopreventive agent resveratrol and its metabolite, piceatannol, with model membranes.', 'Comparison of thermal effects of stilbenoid analogs in lipid bilayers using differential scanning calorimetry and molecular dynamics: correlation of thermal effects and topographical position with antioxidant activity.', 'Effects of cyclosporin A on model lipid membranes.', 'Molecular dynamics simulation study of the effect of DMSO on structural and permeation properties of DMPC lipid bilayers.', 'Resveratrol derivatives: a patent review (2009 - 2012).', 'Phosphorylated resveratrol as a protein aggregation suppressor in vitro and in vivo.', 'Proteostasis of Islet Amyloid Polypeptide: A Molecular Perspective of Risk Factors and Protective Strategies for Type II Diabetes.', 'Amyloidogenic Intrinsically Disordered Proteins: New Insights into Their Self-Assembly and Their Interaction with Membranes.', 'Strategic Syntheses of Vine and Wine Resveratrol Derivatives to Explore their Effects on Cell Functions and Dysfunctions.', 'Resveratrol-based cinnamic ester hybrids: synthesis, characterization, and anti-inflammatory activity.']"""

(Asteraceae) root decoction is used in folk medicine in Cameroon to treat a number of ailments including prostate cancer. The aim of this study was to provide a preliminary validation of the use of Vernonia guineensis Benth. extracts to treat prostate cancer by evaluating the in vitro activity of its crude extracts and isolated molecules on prostate cancer cells lines and effect on angiogenesis which is essential for growth and metastases of prostate cancer.  Materials and methods:   Aqueous, dichloromethane and methanol extracts of Vernonia guineensis Benth. tubers were tested for activity against three prostate cancer cell lines (PC-3, DU-145 and AT3B-1). The dichloromethane extract was subjected to bioactivity guided fractionation. Anti-proliferation, clonogenic and antiangiogenic activity of the crude extracts and isolated compound were tested. The WST-1 assay was used for the anti-proliferation activity meanwhile the standard clonogenic test and the rat ring aorta assay were carried out to determine the clonogenic and antiangiogenic activity of tested products respectively.  Results:   The aqueous and methanol extracts of Vernonia guineensis Benth. demonstrated weak activity against prostate cancer cell lines in vitro with IC(50)>100 μg/mL. The dichloromethane extract was more potent with IC(50) of 56.233±3.630 μg/ml and 67.316±2.452 μg/ml against the DU-145 and PC-3 cell lines respectively. Activity guided fractionation of this extract yielded a Pentaisovalerylsucrose (1) isolated for the first time from a natural source to the best of our knowledge. Compound 1 demonstrated in vitro activity against the human prostate cancer cell lines PC-3 and DU-145 with IC(50) of 5.701±0.142 μM and 4.275±0.710 μM, respectively. The IC(50) of the compound was 5.763±0.425 μM against AT3B-1, a rat prostate cancer cell line expressing P-glycoprotein which is linked to drug resistance in most metastatic cancers. Compared to compound 1, Paclitaxel and Docetaxel were active against AT3B-1 at 2.641±1.253 μM and 0.613±0.251 μM. Paclitaxel showed IC(50) values of 0.004±0.002 μM and 0.003±0.001 μM against DU-145 and PC-3 prostate cancer cell lines respectively. Docetaxel showed IC(50) values of 0.002±0.001 μM and 0.004±0.001 μM against DU-145 and PC-3 prostate cancer cell lines respectively.

When the bladder tumour infiltrates the detrusor muscle, the situation becomes life-threatening for the patient and radical treatment is envisaged. Uro-CT is the standard examination to characterise the lesion and describe its relationship with neighbouring organs. It is essential, and must be performed before endoscopic resection of the tumour, to be correctly interpreted.

Methods and materials:   From 2001 through 2006, 26 consecutive patients were treated on the trial. The primary objective was to demonstrate a high rate of completion without experiencing a treatment-limiting toxicity. Eligibility was limited to patients with T stage ≤2b, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) ≤20, and Gleason score ≤7. Treatment began with a single HDR fraction of 6Gy to the entire prostate and 9Gy to the peripheral zone, followed by IMRT optimized to deliver in 28 fractions with a normalized total dose of 70Gy. Patients received 50.4Gy to the pelvic lymph node. The prostate dose (IMRT and HDR) resulted in an average biologic equivalent dose >128Gy (α/β=3). Patients whose pretreatment PSA was ≥10ng/mL, Gleason score 7, or stage ≥T2b received short-term androgen ablation.  Results:   Median followup was 53 months (9-68 months). There were no biochemical failures by either the American Society of Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology or the Phoenix definitions. The median nadir PSA was 0.32ng/mL. All the 26 patients completed the treatment as prescribed. The rate of Grade 3 late genitourinary toxicity was 3.8% consisting of a urethral stricture.

Materials and methods:   Forty-two patients without biopsy-proven cancer and who underwent MRI were included. In all patients, MRI was performed at 3T using a pelvic phased-array coil and included T2-weighted imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging, and dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging. Thirteen had undergone no previous biopsy, and 29 had undergone at least 1 previous negative biopsy. All patients underwent prostate biopsy following MRI. Two fellowship-trained radiologists in consensus reviewed all cases and categorized each lobe as positive or negative for tumor. These interpretations were correlated with findings on post-MRI biopsy.  Results:   Follow-up biopsy was positive in 23 lobes in 15 patients (36% of study cohort). On a per-patient basis, MRI had a sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 74%, positive predictive value (PPV) of 68%, and negative predictive value (NPV) of 100%.

Conclusions:   In our sample, MRI had 100% sensitivity in predicting the presence of tumor on subsequent biopsy on a per-patient basis, suggesting a possible role for MRI in selecting patients with an elevated prostatic specific antigen (PSA) to undergo prostate biopsy.

Subjects:   Incident PC patients (n 1386) and population controls (n 940), frequency-matched on age and region.  Results:   No overall association with PC was found, possibly due to the generally high adherence to the NNR score and its narrow distribution in the study population. Among individual NNR score components, high compared with low intakes of polyunsaturated fat were associated with an increased relative risk of localized PC. No formal interaction with genetic or lifestyle factors was observed, although in stratified analysis a positive association between the NNR and PC was suggested among men with a high genetic risk score but not among men with a medium or low genetic risk score.

In consequence NO-donors could be of special interest for the treatment of deregulated androgen receptor(AR)-signaling in castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).  Methods:   Prostate cancer (PCa) cells were treated with JS-K, a diazeniumdiolate derivate capable of generating large amounts of intracellular NO following activation by glutathione S-transferase. Generation of NO was determined indirectly by the detection of nitrate in tissue culture medium or by immunodetection of nitrotyrosine in the cytoplasm. Effects of JS-K on intracellular AR-levels were determined by western blotting. AR-dimerization was analyzed by mammalian two hybrid assay, nuclear translocation of the AR was visualized in PCa cells transfected with a green fluorescent AR-Eos fusion protein using fluorescence microscopy. Modulation of AR- and WNT-signalling by JS-K was investigated using reporter gene assays. Tumor cell proliferation following JS-K treatment was measured by MTT-Assay.  Results:   The NO-releasing compound JS-K was shown to inhibit AR-mediated reporter gene activity in 22Rv1 CRPC cells. Inhibition of AR signaling was neither due to an inhibition of nuclear import nor to a reduction in AR-dimerization. In contrast to previously tested NO-donors, JS-K was able to reduce the intracellular concentration of functional AR. This could be attributed to the generation of extremely high intracellular levels of the free radical NO as demonstrated indirectly by high levels of nitrotyrosine in JS-K treated cells. Moreover, JS-K diminished WNT-signaling in AR-positive 22Rv1 cells. In line with these observations, castration resistant 22Rv1 cells were found to be more susceptible to the growth inhibitory effects of JS-K than the androgen dependent LNCaP which do not exhibit an active WNT-signaling pathway.  Conclusions:   Our results suggest that small molecules able to inhibit WNT- and AR-signaling via NO-release represent a promising platform for the development of new compounds for the treatment of CRPC.""","""['Martin Laschak', 'Klaus-Dieter Spindler', 'Andres J Schrader', 'Andrea Hessenauer', 'Wolfgang Streicher', 'Mark Schrader', 'Marcus V Cronauer']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['JS-K, a glutathione S-transferase-activated nitric oxide donor with antineoplastic activity in malignant gliomas.', 'JS-K, a nitric oxide pro-drug, regulates growth and apoptosis through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in prostate cancer cells.', 'JS-K, a glutathione/glutathione S-transferase-activated nitric oxide donor of the diazeniumdiolate class with potent antineoplastic activity.', 'The nitric oxide prodrug JS-K and its structural analogues as cancer therapeutic agents.', 'A review of the relatively complex mechanism of JS-K induced apoptosis in cancer cells.', 'Functional roles of E3 ubiquitin ligases in prostate cancer.', 'Gasotransmitters in the tumor microenvironment: Impacts on cancer chemotherapy (Review).', 'Metformin in combination with JS-K inhibits growth of renal cell carcinoma cells via reactive oxygen species activation and inducing DNA breaks.', 'The evolving landscape for cellular nitric oxide and hydrogen sulfide delivery systems: A new era of customized medications.', 'The Yin Yang Role of Nitric Oxide in Prostate Cancer.']"""

Methods:   Colon cancer (HCT116, SW480), prostate cancer (PC3, LNCaP) and leukemia (K562) cells were treated with STI571 and TRAIL. Cell viability was determined by MTT assay and sub-G1 appearance. Protein expression and kinase phosphorylation were determined by Western blotting. c-Abl and p73 activities were inhibited by target-specific small interfering (si)RNA. In vitro kinase assay of c-Abl was conducted using CRK as a substrate.  Results:   We found that STI571 exerts opposite effects on the antitumor activity of TRAIL. It enhanced cytotoxicity in TRAIL-treated K562 leukemia cells and reduced TRAIL-induced apoptosis in HCT116 and SW480 colon cancer cells, while having no effect on PC3 and LNCaP cells. In colon and prostate cancer cells, TRAIL caused c-Abl cleavage to the active form via a caspase pathway. Interestingly, JNK and p38 MAPK inhibitors effectively blocked TRAIL-induced toxicity in the colon, but not in prostate cancer cells. Next, we found that STI571 could attenuate TRAIL-induced c-Abl, JNK and p38 activation in HCT116 cells. In addition, siRNA targeting knockdown of c-Abl and p73 also reduced TRAIL-induced cytotoxicity, rendering HCT116 cells less responsive to stress kinase activation, and masking the cytoprotective effect of STI571.  Conclusions:   All together we demonstrate a novel mediator role of p73 in activating the stress kinases p38 and JNK in the classical apoptotic pathway of TRAIL. TRAIL via caspase-dependent action can sequentially activate c-Abl, p73, and stress kinases, which contribute to apoptosis in colon cancer cells. Through the inhibition of c-Abl-mediated apoptotic p73 signaling, STI571 reduces the antitumor activity of TRAIL in colon cancer cells.

To obtain these data and to characterize the stability of aPPD, appropriate analytical assay development was carried out. The solubility and stability of aPPD were determined, and the compound was formulated for oral gavage. aPPD levels in blood and tissues following oral administration to nu/nu nude mice were determined using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry. The efficacy of aPPD was determined upon oral administration to nu/nu nude mice bearing PC-3 human prostate cancer xenograft tumors. Immunohistochemical analysis of tumor tissues was performed to establish apoptotic indices and Ki-67 expression as markers of proliferation. The maximum solubility of aPPD in ethanol was 68.4 mg/ml. aPPD administered at a dose of 70 mg/kg yielded a T(max) of approximately 40 min and a C(max) value of 3.9 ± 1.4 μg/ml, and no toxicity was observed. aPPD accumulated largely in the stomach and small intestine and was also present in the brain. This dose engendered a significant delay in PC-3 tumor growth, an increase in apoptotic index, and a decrease in Ki-67 levels.

This represents a possible approach to increase the receptor mediated tumor targeting and consequently the cytostatic effect of anticancer drug-peptide bioconjugates. The multifunctional bioconjugates were prepared according to two drug design approaches recently developed by our group. Both bifunctional GnRH-III derivatives, [(4)Lys]-GnRH-III (Glp-His-Trp-Lys-His-Asp-Trp-Lys-Pro-Gly-NH(2)) and [(8)Lys(Lys)]-GnRH-III (Glp-His-Trp-Ser-His-Asp-Trp-Lys(Lys)-Pro-Gly-NH(2)), contain two free amino groups suitable for the attachment of two anticancer drugs, such as methotrexate and daunorubicin. The drugs were chosen with respect to their different mechanisms of action, with the goal of increasing the antitumor effect of the bioconjugates. The in vitro cytostatic effect of the bioconjugates was determined on MCF-7 human breast, HT-29 human colon and LNCaP human prostate cancer cells by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. Their in vitro stability/degradation in human serum and in the presence of rat liver lysosomal homogenate was investigated by liquid chromatography in combination with mass spectrometry. The influence of the multifunctional bioconjugates on the cell adhesion and cell proliferation was studied on Mono Mac 6 human leukemic monocytes. It was found that (1) all synthesized bioconjugates had in vitro cytostatic effect; (2) they were stable in human serum for at least 24 h; (3) they were hydrolyzed in the presence of lysosomal homogenate and (4) they exerted a moderate cell-cell adhesion inducing effect. These results demonstrate that multifunctional bioconjugates containing two different anticancer drugs attached to the same GnRH-III targeting moiety could be successfully prepared and resulted in higher in vitro cytostatic effect than the monofunctional bioconjugates containing either methotrexate or daunorubicin, in particular on HT-29 human colon cancer cells.""","""['Ulrike Leurs', 'Eszter Lajkó', 'Gábor Mező', 'Erika Orbán', 'Peter Öhlschläger', 'Andreas Marquardt', 'László Kőhidai', 'Marilena Manea']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Eur J Med Chem""","""['Enhanced enzymatic stability and antitumor activity of daunorubicin-GnRH-III bioconjugates modified in position 4.', 'In vitro degradation and antitumor activity of oxime bond-linked daunorubicin-GnRH-III bioconjugates and DNA-binding properties of daunorubicin-amino acid metabolites.', 'Synthesis, enzymatic stability and in vitro cytostatic effect of Daunorubicin-GnRH-III derivative dimers.', 'lGnRH-III -- a promising candidate for anticancer drug development.', 'Peptides and antitumor activity.

Recent studies showed that XMRV is a recombinant mouse retrovirus; hence, its association with human diseases has become questionable. Here, we demonstrated that XMRV envelope (Env)-mediated pseudoviral infection is not blocked by lysosomotropic agents and cellular protease inhibitors, suggesting that XMRV entry is not pH-dependent. The full length XMRV Env was unable to induce syncytia formation and cell-cell fusion, even in cells overexpressing the viral receptor, XPR1. However, truncation of the C-terminal 21 or 33 amino acid residues in the cytoplasmic tail (CT) of XMRV Env induced substantial membrane fusion, not only in the permissive 293 cells but also in the nonpermissive CHO cells that lack a functional XPR1 receptor. The increased fusion activities of these truncations correlated with their enhanced SU shedding into culture media, suggesting conformational changes in the ectodomain of XMRV Env. Noticeably, further truncation of the CT of XMRV Env proximal to the membrane-spanning domain severely impaired the Env fusogenicity, as well as dramatically decreased the Env incorporations into MoMLV oncoretroviral and HIV-1 lentiviral vectors resulting in greatly reduced viral transductions. Collectively, our studies reveal that XMRV entry does not require a low pH or low pH-dependent host proteases, and that the cytoplasmic tail of XMRV Env critically modulates membrane fusion and cell entry.

The objective of this study was the identification and characterization of miR-let-7c as a potential tumor suppressor in PCa.  Experimental design:   Levels of expression of miR-let-7c were examined in human PCa cell lines and tissues using qRT-PCR and in situ hybridization. Let-7c was overexpressed or suppressed to assess the effects on the growth of human PCa cell lines. Lentiviral-mediated re-expression of let-7c was utilized to assess the effects on human PCa xenografts.  Results:   We identified miR-let-7c as a potential tumor suppressor in PCa. Expression of let-7c is downregulated in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) cells. Overexpression of let-7c decreased while downregulation of let-7c increased cell proliferation, clonogenicity and anchorage-independent growth of PCa cells in vitro. Suppression of let-7c expression enhanced the ability of androgen-sensitive PCa cells to grow in androgen-deprived conditions in vitro. Reconstitution of Let-7c by lentiviral-mediated intratumoral delivery significantly reduced tumor burden in xenografts of human PCa cells. Furthermore, let-7c expression is downregulated in clinical PCa specimens compared to their matched benign tissues, while the expression of Lin28, a master regulator of let-7 miRNA processing, is upregulated in clinical PCa specimens.

When studying complex diseases such as CaP that have a heritable component, chances of finding true disease susceptibility alleles can be increased by accounting for genetic ancestry within the population investigated. Race, ethnicity and ancestry were studied in a geographically diverse cohort of men with newly diagnosed CaP.  Methods:   Individual ancestry (IA) was estimated in the population-based North Carolina and Louisiana Prostate Cancer Project (PCaP), a cohort of 2,106 incident CaP cases (2063 with complete ethnicity information) comprising roughly equal numbers of research subjects reporting as Black/African American (AA) or European American/Caucasian/Caucasian American/White (EA) from North Carolina or Louisiana. Mean genome wide individual ancestry estimates of percent African, European and Asian were obtained and tested for differences by state and ethnicity (Cajun and/or Creole and Hispanic/Latino) using multivariate analysis of variance models. Principal components (PC) were compared to assess differences in genetic composition by self-reported race and ethnicity between and within states.  Results:   Mean individual ancestries differed by state for self-reporting AA (p = 0.03) and EA (p = 0.001). This geographic difference attenuated for AAs who answered ""no"" to all ethnicity membership questions (non-ethnic research subjects; p = 0.78) but not EA research subjects, p = 0.002. Mean ancestry estimates of self-identified AA Louisiana research subjects for each ethnic group; Cajun only, Creole only and both Cajun and Creole differed significantly from self-identified non-ethnic AA Louisiana research subjects. These ethnicity differences were not seen in those who self-identified as EA.  Conclusions:   Mean IA differed by race between states, elucidating a potential contributing factor to these differences in AA research participants: self-reported ethnicity.

Sr-89 is an established alternative for the palliation of bone pain in prostate cancer. We aimed to assess the effect of Sr-89 radionuclide therapy on quality of life (QOL) in prostate cancer patients with painful bone metastases.  Materials and methods:   Thirteen patients received a single intravenous injection of Sr-89 at a dose of 2.0 MBq/kg. All patients underwent QOL evaluation prior to Sr-89 treatment and 1, 2, and 3 months afterward using the Japanese version of the EORTC QLQ-BM22, EORTC QLQ-C30, a VAS, and face scale. We also evaluated PSA and ALP response and toxicity of the Sr-89 therapy.  Results:   The pain characteristics subscale of the EORTC QLQ-BM22 was significantly reduced from 1 month onward compared with the baseline. The functional interference and psychosocial aspects subscales were significantly higher than baseline from 2 months onward. At 2 months, VAS indicated a significant reduction in pain as compared to the baseline. Sr-89 therapy caused a nonsignificant reduction in PSA and ALP levels.

Weight gain with insulin resistance, disturbances of lipid metabolism and gynecomastia are other effects of androgen deficiency. A decrease in bone mineral density may lead to an increased susceptibility to bone fractures.

During the last decade, curcumin (diferuloylmethane), a natural compound from the root of turmeric (Curcuma longa), was described as a potent chemopreventive agent. Curcumin exhibits anti-inflammatory, anticarcinogenic, antiproliferative, antiangiogenic, and antioxidant properties in various cancer cell models. This study was designed to identify proteins involved in the anticancer activity of curcumin in androgen-dependent (22Rv1) and -independent (PC-3) human prostate cancer cell lines using two-dimensional difference in gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE). Out of 425 differentially expressed spots, we describe here the MALDI-TOF-MS analysis of 192 spots of interest, selected by their expression profile. This approach allowed the identification of 60 differentially expressed proteins (32 in 22Rv1 cells and 47 in PC-3 cells). Nineteen proteins are regulated in both cell lines. Further bioinformatic analysis shows that proteins modulated by curcumin are implicated in protein folding (such as heat-shock protein PPP2R1A; RNA splicing proteins RBM17, DDX39; cell death proteins HMGB1 and NPM1; proteins involved in androgen receptor signaling, NPM1 and FKBP4/FKBP52), and that this compound could have an impact on miR-141, miR-152, and miR-183 expression.

The goal of the current study was to examine the relationship between changes in fatigue following initiation of ADT and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in three pro-inflammatory cytokine genes: interleukin-1 beta (IL1B), interleukin-6 (IL6), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFA).  Methods:   As part of a larger study, men with prostate cancer (n = 53) were recruited prior to initiation of ADT. Fatigue was assessed at recruitment and 6 months after initiation of ADT. DNA was extracted from blood drawn at baseline.  Results:   Patients with the IL6-174 (rs1800795) G/C or C/C genotype displayed greater increases in fatigue intrusiveness, frequency, and duration than the G/G genotype (p values ≤ 0.05), although inclusion of age, race, and baseline depressive symptomatology in the model attenuated these relationships (p values ≤ 0.09). Patients with the TNFA-308 (rs1800629) G/A genotype showed greater increases in fatigue severity than the G/G genotype (p = 0.02). IL1B-511 (rs16944) genotype did not significantly predict changes in fatigue (p values >0.46). Patients with higher numbers of variants displayed greater increases in fatigue duration and interference (p values ≤ 0.02) than patients with lower numbers of variants.  Conclusions:   Prostate cancer patients treated with ADT who carry variant alleles of the IL6 and TNFA genes are susceptible to heightened fatigue. These preliminary data lend support for the role of genetic variation in the development of cancer-related fatigue secondary to ADT.

However, its effectiveness may be limited by negative immunological checkpoints that attenuate immune responses. Recently a clinical trial of IL-15 in cancer immunotherapy was initiated. Finding strategies to conquer negative regulators and enhance efficacy of IL-15 is critical and meaningful for such clinical trials. In a preclinical study, we evaluated IL-15 combined with antibodies to block negative immune regulator cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) and programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) in an established murine transgenic adenocarcinoma of mouse prostate (TRAMP)-C2 prostate tumor model. IL-15 treatment resulted in a significant prolongation of survival in tumor-bearing animals. Coadministration of anti-PD-L1 or anti-CTLA-4 singly with IL-15 did not improve animal survival over that of IL-15 alone. However, simultaneous administration of IL-15 with anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-L1 was associated with increased numbers of tumor antigen-specific tetramer-positive CD8 T cells, increased CD8 T-cell tumor lytic activity, augmented antigen-specific IFN-γ release, decreased rates of tumor growth, and improved animal survival compared with IL-15 alone. Furthermore, triple combination therapy was associated with inhibition of suppressive functions of CD4(+)CD25(+) regulatory T cells and CD8(+)CD122(+) regulatory T cells. Thus, simultaneous blockade of CTLA-4 and PD-L1 protected CD4 and/or CD8 T-cell activity from these regulatory T cells. Combining the immune stimulatory properties of IL-15 with simultaneous removal of two critical immune inhibitory checkpoints, we showed enhancement of immune responses, leading to increased antitumor activity.""","""['Ping Yu', 'Jason C Steel', 'Meili Zhang', 'John C Morris', 'Rebecca Waitz', 'Marcella Fasso', 'James P Allison', 'Thomas A Waldmann']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A""","""['Re: simultaneous inhibition of two regulatory T-cell subsets enhanced interleukin-15 efficacy in a prostate tumor model.', 'Dual blockade of PD-1 and CTLA-4 combined with tumor vaccine effectively restores T-cell rejection function in tumors.', 'Enhanced tumor eradication by combining CTLA-4 or PD-1 blockade with CpG therapy.', 'Simultaneous blockade of multiple immune system inhibitory checkpoints enhances antitumor activity mediated by interleukin-15 in a murine metastatic colon carcinoma model.', 'Immunotherapy for cancer treatment.', 'B7x in cancer immunity and immunotherapy.', 'Cyto-IL-15 synergizes with the STING agonist ADU-S100 to eliminate prostate tumors and confer durable immunity in mouse models.', 'The Detection of Exosomal PD-L1 in Peripheral Blood.', 'Tumor extracellular vesicles mediate anti-PD-L1 therapy resistance by decoying anti-PD-L1.', 'Peripheral cytokine levels as novel predictors of survival in cancer patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors: A systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Harnessing IL-15 signaling to potentiate NK cell-mediated cancer immunotherapy.']"""

A well-organized protein biomarker validation process that includes facile measurement of protein isoforms would accelerate development of effective protein-based diagnostics.

The multistep assay performs all immunoblotting steps: separation, immobilization of resolved proteins, antibody probing of immobilized proteins, and all interim wash steps.

Malignant transformation and tumor progression to metastasis are often associated with changes in cytoskeletal organization and cell-cell adhesion. Here we have established in human cells that the AJ-associated protein α-catenin is a new binding partner of DLC1. Their binding was mediated by the N-terminal amino acids 340 to 435 of DLC1 and the N-terminal amino acids 117 to 161 of α-catenin. These proteins colocalized in the cytosol and in the plasma membrane, where together they associated with E-cadherin and β-catenin, constitutive AJ proteins. Binding of DLC1 to α-catenin led to their accumulation at the plasma membrane and required DLC1 GAP activity. Knocking down α-catenin in DLC1-positive cells diminished DLC1 localization at the membrane. The DLC1-α-catenin complex reduced the Rho GTP level at the plasma membrane, increased E-cadherin's mobility, affected actin organization, and stabilized AJs. This process eventually contributed to a robust oncosuppressive effect of DLC1 in metastatic prostate carcinoma cells.

NRBP1 interacts directly with TSC-22, a potential tumor suppressor gene that is differently expressed in prostate cancer. Consequently, we analyzed the role of NRBP1 expression in prostate cancer cell lines and its expression on prostate cancer tissue microarrays (TMA).  Methods:   The effect of NRBP1 expression on tumor cell growth was analyzed by using RNAi. NRBP1 protein expression was evaluated on two TMAs containing prostate samples from more than 1,000 patients. Associations with clinico-pathological features, the proliferation marker Ki67 and survival data were analyzed.  Results:   RNAi mediated silencing of NRBP1 expression in prostate cancer cell lines resulted in reduced cell growth (P < 0.05). TMA analysis revealed NRBP1 protein expression in benign prostate hyperplasia in 6% as compared to 60% in both, high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia and prostate cancer samples. Strong NRBP1 protein expression was restricted to prostate cancer and correlated with higher expression of the proliferation marker Ki67 (P < 0.05). Further, patients with strong NRBP1 protein expression showed poor clinical outcomes (P < 0.05). Analysis of matched localized cancer tissues before and after castration revealed that post-therapy-related repression of NRBP1 expression was significantly associated with better overall survival.

However, tumors formed by a mixture of tumor cells and Matrigel may vary significantly. The purpose of this study was to compare tumor development and growth of LNCaP human prostate cancer cells mixed with Matrigel or in gelatin sponges.  Methods:   LNCaP cells were mixed with Matrigel or absorbed into VETSPON, a gelatin sponge, and inoculated into the subcutis of nude mice. Tumor incidence and growth rate were determined. Gene expression and cell growth and survival in tumor lesions were evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC), immunoblotting, and RT-PCR.  Results:   All mice (12/12) inoculated with LNCaP cells in VETSPON produced tumors, compared to 70% (19/27) of mice injected with the cells with Matrigel. Tumor volume also varied less with VETSPON implants. No significant differences were observed in gene expression, cell growth, apoptosis, and microvessel density in tumors established from the two types of implants. However, in samples collected on days 1 and 4, more cells in Matrigel implants than those in VETSPON implants were stained positive for cleaved-caspase 3 and -PARP1. Expression of VEGF-A, HIF-1α, and Bcl-2 was elevated in the early VETSPON implants.  Conclusion:   These data indicate that VETSPON promotes tumor cell survival at the early stage of implantation and suggest that the gelatin sponge is superior to Matrigel in supporting development and progression of human prostate cancer in nude mice.

However, few insights are available regarding the functional role of MUC1 in prostate cancer.  Methods:   Effects of MUC1-C on androgen receptor (AR) expression were determined by RT-PCR, immunoblotting and AR promoter activation. Coimmunoprecipitations, direct binding assays, and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) studies were performed to assess the interaction between MUC1-C and AR. Cells were analyzed for invasion, growth in androgen-depleted medium, and sensitivity to MUC1-C inhibitors.  Results:   The present studies in androgen-dependent LNCaP and LAPC4 prostate cancer cells demonstrate that the oncogenic MUC1-C subunit suppresses AR expression. The results show that MUC1-C activates a posttranscriptional mechanism involving miR-135b-mediated downregulation of AR mRNA levels. The results further demonstrate that MUC1-C forms a complex with AR through a direct interaction between the MUC1-C cytoplasmic domain and the AR DNA-binding domain (DBD). In addition, MUC1-C associates with AR in a complex that occupies the PSA promoter. The interaction between MUC1-C and AR is associated with induction of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and increased invasion. MUC1-C also conferred growth in androgen-depleted medium and resistance to bicalutamide treatment. Moreover, expression of MUC1-C resulted in sensitivity to the MUC1-C inhibitor GO-203 with inhibition of growth in vitro. GO-203 treatment also inhibited growth of established tumor xenografts in nude mice.

Cell invasion was assessed by Boyden-chamber assay and flow cytometry analysis was used to study apoptosis and cell cycle distribution. An orthotopic mouse model for prostate cancer with PC-3-Luc cells was used to study the in vivo effect of TA.  Results:   TA inhibited the expression of Sp1, c-Met, p-Akt, and survivin; increased c-PARP expression and caspases activity in PC-3 cells. TA caused cell arrest at G(0) /G(1) phase accompanied by a decrease in cdk4, cdc2, cyclin D3, and E2F1 and an increase in critical apoptotic markers.

Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), a lipid mediator present in serum, enhances migration of carcinoma cells. The effects of LPA on calpain-mediated proteolysis were, therefore, examined in PC-3, a human prostate cancer cell line.  Methods:   Cultured PC-3 cells were used in studies utilizing pharmacologic interventions, immunoblotting, and confocal immunolocalization.  Results:   Focal adhesion kinase (FAK), a tyrosine kinase involved in cell adhesion, is rapidly proteolyzed in serum-starved PC-3 cells exposed to the calcium ionophore, ionomycin; Nck, p130CAS, PKCα, and Ras-GAP are also degraded. Thapsigargin, which causes more moderate increases in intracellular calcium, induces partial proteolysis of these proteins. Calpain inhibitors block the proteolytic responses to ionomycin and thapsigargin. Ionomycin does not induce proteolysis in cells maintained in serum, suggesting a protective role for growth factors contained in serum. LPA causes minor FAK proteolysis when added alone, but protects against ionomycin-induced proteolysis in a time-dependent manner. LPA also protects against the cell detachment that eventually follows ionomycin treatment. The response to LPA is blocked by an LPA receptor antagonist. A similar effect of LPA is observed in ionomycin-treated Rat-1 fibroblasts. In PC-3 cells, the protective effects of LPA and serum are correlated with phosphorylation and redistribution of paxillin, suggesting roles for phosphorylation-mediated protein-protein interactions.

Tumor cell growth, cell cycle progression, and cell cycle regulating proteins were then investigated by the MTT assay, flow cytometry, and western blotting. Tumor cell adhesion to endothelium or to immobilized extracellular matrix proteins, as well as migratory properties of the cells, were evaluated. Integrin α and β adhesion molecules and alterations of cell signaling pathways were analyzed. Finally, effects of the drug treatment on prostate cancer growth in vivo were determined in the NOD/SCID mouse model. VPA reduced tumor cell adhesion, migration, and growth in vitro. A much stronger anti-cancer potential was evoked by the VPA-IFNa combination, although IFNa in itself did not block growth or adhesion. The same effect was seen when tumor growth was evaluated in vivo. Molecular analysis revealed distinct elevation of histone H3 acetylation caused by VPA which was further up-regulated by VPA-IFNa, whereas IFNa alone did not alter H3 acetylation. The combinatorial benefit became obvious in Akt phosphorylation, p21 and p27 and integrin α1, α3, and β1 expression. Application of low-dosed IFNa to a VPA based regimen profoundly boosts the anti-tumor properties of VPA.

We recently found that DC-SCRIPT is a prognostic marker in breast cancer and a unique NR coregulator differentially regulating different classes of NRs. Here we investigated the importance of DC-SCRIPT in prostate cancer.  Methods:   DC-SCRIPT mRNA expression was measured by qPCR. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect DC-SCRIPT protein expression. The functional effects of DC-SCRIPT on the transcriptional activity of AR and VDR were assessed by luciferase reporter assays and qPCR assays on well-known AR and VDR target genes.  Results:   DC-SCRIPT mRNA was higher in normal than in corresponding malignant prostate tissue but could not be related to disease stage. DC-SCRIPT protein was found in morphologically normal prostate glands and in infiltrating immune cells. Strikingly, DC-SCRIPT protein expression was absent in malignant prostate epithelial tissue and prostate carcinoma cell lines. DC-SCRIPT protein expression appears to be lost prior to the basal cell marker HMW cytokeratin used in prostate carcinoma diagnostics. In addition, our data demonstrated that DC-SCRIPT repressed transcription mediated by wild-type and mutated AR while enhancing VDR mediated transcription. In addition, transient expression of DC-SCRIPT expression in prostate carcinoma cells strongly repressed cell growth.

Malignant cells release extracellular factors, modifying tumor behavior. Inorganic arsenic, a human carcinogen, is associated with an overproduction of CSCs in various model systems of carcinogenesis.  Objective:   We aimed to determine if NSCs are influenced by nearby arsenic-transformed malignant epithelial cells (MECs) as a possible factor in arsenic-associated CSC overabundance.  Methods:   Transwell noncontact co-culture allowed the study of the effects of non-contiguous, arsenic-transformed prostate MECs on the isogenic human prostate NSC line, WPE-stem. Cancer phenotype was assessed by evaluating secreted matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), invasiveness, colony formation, and spheroid formation. Gene expression was assessed at the protein (Western blot) or mRNA (real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction) levels.  Results:   Noncontact co-culture of MECs and NSCs rapidly (≤ 3 weeks) caused hypersecretion of MMPs and marked suppression of the tumor suppressor gene PTEN in NSCs. NSCs co-cultured with MECs also showed increased invasiveness and clonogenicity and formed more free-floating spheroids and highly branched ductal-like structures in Matrigel, all typical for CSCs. MEC co-culture caused dysregulated self-renewal and differentiation-related gene expression patterns and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in NSCs consistent with an acquired cancer phenotype. Interleukin-6 (IL-6), a cytokine involved in tumor microenvironment control, was hypersecreted by MECs, and IL-6 exposure of NSCs resulted in the duplication of several responses in NSCs of conversion to CSCs via MEC co-culture (e.g., MMP hypersecretion, decreased PTEN).  Conclusions:   Arsenic-transformed MECs recruit nearby NSCs into a cancer phenotype, thereby potentially increasing CSC number.

The goal of this work is to determine inter-fraction setup errors and prostate motion in IMRT for localized prostate cancer, guided by daily kilovoltage cone beam computed tomography (kVCBCT).  Methods:   Systematic and random components of the shifts were retrospectively evaluated by comparing two matching modalities (automatic bone and manual soft-tissue) between each of the 641 daily kVCBCTs (18 patients) and the planning kVCT. A simulated Adaptive Radiation Therapy (ART) protocol using the average of the first 5 kVCBCTs was tested by non-parametric bootstrapping procedure.  Results:   Shifts were < 1 mm in left-right (LR) and in supero-inferior (SI) direction. In antero-posterior (AP) direction systematic prostate motion (2.7 ± 0.7 mm) gave the major contribution to the variability of results; the averages of the absolute total shifts were significantly larger in anterior (6.3 ± 0.2 mm) than in posterior (3.9 mm ± 0.2 mm) direction. The ART protocol would reduce margins in LR, SI and anterior but not in posterior direction.  Conclusions:   The online soft-tissue correction based on daily kVCBCT during IMRT of prostate cancer is fast and efficient. The large random movements of prostate respect to bony anatomy, especially in the AP direction, where anisotropic margins are needed, suggest that daily kVCBCT is at the present time preferable for high dose and high gradients IMRT prostate treatments.""","""['Marcella Palombarini', 'Stefano Mengoli', 'Paola Fantazzini', 'Cecilia Cadioli', 'Claudio Degli Esposti', 'Giovanni Piero Frezza']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Radiat Oncol""","""['Adaptive radiotherapy and the dosimetric impact of inter- and intrafractional motion on the planning target volume for prostate cancer patients.', 'The impact of the three degrees-of-freedom fiducial marker-based setup compared to soft tissue-based setup in hypofractionated intensity-modulated radiotherapy for prostate cancer.', 'PTV margin analysis for prostate patients treated with initial pelvic nodal IMRT and prostate proton boost.', 'Superiority of a soft tissue-based setup using cone-beam computed tomography over a bony structure-based setup in intensity-modulated radiotherapy for prostate cancer.', 'Image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT) for prostate cancer comparing kV imaging of fiducial markers with cone beam computed tomography (CBCT).', 'Dosimetric comparison between volumetric modulated arc therapy planning techniques for prostate cancer in the presence of intrafractional organ deformation.', 'IMPACT OF THREE DIFFERENT MATCHING METHODS ON PATIENT SET-UP ERROR IN X-RAY VOLUMETRIC IMAGING FOR HEAD AND NECK CANCER.', 'Retrospective analysis of the impact of respiratory motion in treatment margins for frameless lung SBRT based on respiratory-correlated CBCT data-sets.', 'Impact of Inter-fractional Anatomical Changes on Dose Distributions in Passive Carbon-Ion Radiotherapy for Prostate Cancer: Comparison of Vertical and Horizontal Fields.', 'Positioning error and expanding margins of planning target volume with kilovoltage cone beam computed tomography for prostate cancer radiotherapy.']"""

We present the results of a pilot study investigating the association between type 2 diabetes and selected single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in/near nine circadian genes. The variants were chosen based on their previously reported association with prostate cancer, a disease that has been suggested to have a genetic link with type 2 diabetes through a number of shared inherited risk determinants.  Methodology/principal findings:   The pilot study was performed using two genetically homogeneous Punjabi cohorts, one resident in the United Kingdom and one indigenous to Pakistan. Subjects with (N = 1732) and without (N = 1780) type 2 diabetes were genotyped for thirteen circadian variants using a competitive allele-specific polymerase chain reaction method. Associations between the SNPs and type 2 diabetes were investigated using logistic regression. The results were also combined with in silico data from other South Asian datasets (SAT2D consortium) and white European cohorts (DIAGRAM+) using meta-analysis. The rs7602358G allele near PER2 was negatively associated with type 2 diabetes in our Punjabi cohorts (combined odds ratio [OR] = 0.75 [0.66-0.86], p = 3.18 × 10(-5)), while the BMAL1 rs11022775T allele was associated with an increased risk of the disease (combined OR = 1.22 [1.07-1.39], p = 0.003). Neither of these associations was replicated in the SAT2D or DIAGRAM+ datasets, however.

Thirty patients treated with HDR-ISBT as monotherapy were examined. All patients received a treatment dosage of 49 Gy per 7 fractions over 4 days. For dose administration, we examined 376 flexible applicators (1128 points) using our unique ambulatory implant technique. Using CT images with a 3-mm slice thickness, we calculated the relative coordinates of the titanium markers and the tips of the applicators. We calculated the distance between the center of gravity of the markers and the tips of the catheters, and compared the distances measured on the day of implantation and the second, third, and fourth treatment days. The mean displacement distance for all applicators was 4.3 ± 3.4 mm, 4.6 ± 4.1 mm, and 5.8 ± 4.5 mm at 21, 45, and 69 hours after initial planning CT. We used a 15-mm margin for needle displacement and only 2 points of 2 patients (16 mm and 18 mm at 69 hours, 2/1128 = 0.2%) exceeded this range. Almost patients (87%) showed the largest displacement within the first 21 hours.

They are key molecules during inflammatory processes, and many studies are focusing on their regulatory functions in tumor growth and angiogenesis during metastatic cell seeding and spreading. Bindarit is an anti-inflammatory indazolic derivative that can inhibit the synthesis of MCP-1/CCL2, with a potential inhibitory function in tumor progression and metastasis formation. We show here that in vitro, bindarit can modulate cancer-cell proliferation and migration, mainly through negative regulation of TGF-β and AKT signaling, and it can impair the NF-κB signaling pathway through enhancing the expression of the NF-κB inhibitor IkB-α. In vivo administration of bindarit results in impaired metastatic disease in prostate cancer xenograft mice (PC-3M-Luc2 cells injected intra-cardially) and impairment of local tumorigenesis in syngeneic Balb/c mice injected under the mammary gland with murine breast cancer cells (4T1-Luc cells). In addition, bindarit treatment significantly decreases the infiltration of tumor-associated macrophages and myeloid-derived suppressor cells in 4T1-Luc primary tumors.

Here, we used ChIP coupled to massively parallel sequencing (ChIP-seq) and gene expression profiling in mouse prostates to identify direct targets of the tumor suppressor Nkx3.1. Further analysis indicated that a substantial fraction of Nkx3.1 target genes are also direct targets of the oncoprotein Myc.

Furthermore, loss of Nkx3.1 cooperated with concurrent overexpression of Myc to promote prostate cancer in transgenic mice. In human prostate cancer patients, dysregulation of shared NKX3.1/MYC target genes was associated with disease relapse. Our results indicate that NKX3.1 and MYC coregulate prostate tumorigenesis by converging on, and crossregulating, a common set of target genes.

Several studies by us and other investigators have linked this enzyme to effects on estrogen receptor activation. In a previous report we examined the effect of CYP7B1-mediated hormone metabolism for estrogen-mediated response in kidney-derived HEK293 cells. In the current study we used an androgen response element (ARE) reporter system to examine androgen-dependent response of some CYP7B1 substrates and CYP7B1-formed metabolites in several cell lines derived from different tissues. The results indicate significantly lower androgen receptor activation by CYP7B1-formed steroid metabolites than by the corresponding steroid substrates, suggesting that CYP7B1-mediated catalysis may decrease some androgenic responses. Thus, CYP7B1-dependent metabolism may be of importance not only for estrogenic signaling but also for androgenic. This finding, that CYP7B1 activity may be a regulator of androgenic signaling by converting AR ligands into less active metabolites, is also supported by real-time RT-PCR experiment where a CYP7B1 substrate, but not the corresponding product, was able to stimulate known androgen-sensitive genes. Furthermore, our data indicate that the effects of some steroids on hormone response element reporter systems are cell line-specific. For instance, despite transfection of the same reporter systems, 5-androstene-3β,17β-diol strongly activates an androgen-dependent response element in prostate cancer cells whereas it elicits only ER-dependent responses in kidney HEK293 cells.

Therefore, targeting prostate CSCs may be an ideal strategy to cure PCa. Genistein is a major isoflavone constituent of soybeans and soy products, which has been shown to exhibit potent anticancer effect on many cancers. We have previously reported that genistein can inhibit PCa cell invasion by reversing epithelial to mesenchymal transition, suggesting that genistein may be effective against metastatic PCa. In addition, we have recently demonstrated that PCa tumorsphere cells (TCs) possess CSC properties. Here, we found that tumorsphere formation and colony formation of Pca cells were noticeably suppressed in the presence of genistein. Pretreatment of PCa TCs with genistein also suppressed tumorigenicity in vivo. Additionally, genistein treatment inhibited tumor growth of PCa TCs. Further studies showed that genistein treatment not only led to the down-regulation of PCa CSC markers CD44 in vitro and in vivo, but also inhibited Hedgehog-Gli1 pathway, which may contribute to the anti-CSC effect of genistein in PCa TCs.

Methods and materials:   Intrafraction prostate motion data from 486 fractions and 15 patients were available. A motion-encoded dose calculation technique was used to determine the variation of the clinical target volume (CTV) D(95%) values with respect to the static plan for SNS plans. The motion data were analyzed separately, and the correlation coefficients between various motion-based metrics and the dosimetric effect were determined. The dosimetric impact was compared with that incurred during another IMRT technique to assess correlation across different delivery techniques.  Results:   The mean (±1 standard deviation [SD]) change in D(95%) in the CTV over all 486 fractions was 0.2 ± 0.5%. After the delivery of five and 12 fractions, the mean (±1 SD) changes over the 15 patients in CTV D(95%) were 0.0 ± 0.2% and 0.1 ± 0.2%, respectively. The correlation coefficients between the CTV D(95%) changes and the evaluated motion metrics were, in general, poor and ranged from r = -0.2 to r = -0.39. Dosimetric effects introduced by identical motion in SNS and helical tomotherapy IMRT techniques were poorly correlated with a correlation coefficient of r = 0.32 for the CTV.  Conclusions:   The dosimetric impact of intrafraction prostate motion on the CTV is, in general, small. In only 4% of all fractions did the dosimetric consequence exceed 1% in the CTV. As expected, the cumulative effect was further reduced with fractionation. The poor correlations between the calculated motion parameters and the subsequent dosimetric effect implies that motion-based thresholds are of limited value in predicting the dosimetric impact of intrafraction motion.

Patients and methods:   Patients who fulfilled the following criteria were included: PSA ≤ 10ng/ml, T1c disease, biopsy Gleason Score ≤ 6 affecting <5% of only 1 core and who had undergone a radical prostatectomy. The following variables were studied: Age, PSA, dPSA, free/total PSA ratio and prostatic volume assessed by transrectal ultrasound.  Results:   In a series of 2424 biopsies, 77 patients completely fulfilled the inclusion criteria, with 66.23% (n=51) of clinical significant disease in the prostatectomy specimen. No differences were observed between these patients and those with insignificant disease in age, PSA, free/total PSA ratio. However, prostatic volume was significantly greater and PSA density significantly lower in those patients with an insignificant disease.

Methods:   The in vitro and in vivo cytotoxic activity of RESV and 3,5-dihydroxy-4'-acetoxy-trans-stilbene (4-ACE) was tested using cellular assays and a xenograft model. Five prostate carcinoma cell lines were used for in vitro evaluation. A melanoma cell line (Duke melanoma 738 [DM738]) and the prostate carcinoma line CWR22 were used for in vivo experiments. Mice were randomized to osmotic mini pumps with 200 μL of RESV (250 mg/mL), 4-ACE (335 mg/mL), or vehicle (50% dimethyl sulfoxide, 50% polyethylene glycol). Serum drug and metabolite levels were calculated by high-performance liquid chromatography with diode-array detection. Western blots were performed on treated tumors.

Pretreatment MRI is now beginning to be acquired at several medical centers. Delineation of the prostate on MRI is acknowledged as being significantly simpler to perform, compared to delineation on CT. In this work, the authors present a novel framework for building a linked statistical shape model (LSSM), a statistical shape model (SSM) that links the shape variation of a structure of interest (SOI) across multiple imaging modalities. This framework is particularly relevant in scenarios where accurate boundary delineations of the SOI on one of the modalities may not be readily available, or difficult to obtain, for training a SSM. In this work the authors apply the LSSM in the context of multimodal prostate segmentation for radiotherapy planning, where the prostate is concurrently segmented on MRI and CT.  Methods:   The framework comprises a number of logically connected steps. The first step utilizes multimodal registration of MRI and CT to map 2D boundary delineations of the prostate from MRI onto corresponding CT images, for a set of training studies. Hence, the scheme obviates the need for expert delineations of the gland on CT for explicitly constructing a SSM for prostate segmentation on CT. The delineations of the prostate gland on MRI and CT allows for 3D reconstruction of the prostate shape which facilitates the building of the LSSM. In order to perform concurrent prostate MRI and CT segmentation using the LSSM, the authors employ a region-based level set approach where the authors deform the evolving prostate boundary to simultaneously fit to MRI and CT images in which voxels are classified to be either part of the prostate or outside the prostate. The classification is facilitated by using a combination of MRI-CT probabilistic spatial atlases and a random forest classifier, driven by gradient and Haar features.  Results:   The authors acquire a total of 20 MRI-CT patient studies and use the leave-one-out strategy to train and evaluate four different LSSMs. First, a fusion-based LSSM (fLSSM) is built using expert ground truth delineations of the prostate on MRI alone, where the ground truth for the gland on CT is obtained via coregistration of the corresponding MRI and CT slices. The authors compare the fLSSM against another LSSM (xLSSM), where expert delineations of the gland on both MRI and CT are employed in the model building; xLSSM representing the idealized LSSM. The authors also compare the fLSSM against an exclusive CT-based SSM (ctSSM), built from expert delineations of the gland on CT alone. In addition, two LSSMs trained using trainee delineations (tLSSM) on CT are compared with the fLSSM. The results indicate that the xLSSM, tLSSMs, and the fLSSM perform equivalently, all of them out-performing the ctSSM.  Conclusions:   The fLSSM provides an accurate alternative to SSMs that require careful expert delineations of the SOI that may be difficult or laborious to obtain. Additionally, the fLSSM has the added benefit of providing concurrent segmentations of the SOI on multiple imaging modalities.""","""['Najeeb Chowdhury', 'Robert Toth', 'Jonathan Chappelow', 'Sung Kim', 'Sabin Motwani', 'Salman Punekar', 'Haibo Lin', 'Stefan Both', 'Neha Vapiwala', 'Stephen Hahn', 'Anant Madabhushi']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Locally-constrained boundary regression for segmentation of prostate and rectum in the planning CT images.', 'Object-constrained meshless deformable algorithm for high speed 3D nonrigid registration between CT and CBCT.', 'Radiomics based targeted radiotherapy planning (Rad-TRaP): a computational framework for prostate cancer treatment planning with MRI.', 'MRI-GUIDED RADIOTHERAPY FOR PROSTATE CANCER: A NEW PARADIGM.', 'Challenges in accurate registration of 3-D medical imaging and histopathology in primary prostate cancer.', 'Automatic segmentation of pulmonary lobes on low-dose computed tomography using deep learning.', 'Segmentation of prostate and prostate zones using deep learning : A\xa0multi-MRI vendor analysis.', 'Towards a universal MRI atlas of the prostate and prostate zones : Comparison of MRI vendor and image acquisition parameters.', 'A review of substitute CT generation for MRI-only radiation therapy.', 'A Learning-Based CT Prostate Segmentation Method via Joint Transductive Feature Selection and Regression.']"""

Methods:   For CT images, an acrylic phantom mimicking a clinical implantation plan and embedded with low contrast regions of interest (ROIs) was designed for both the 0.774 mm diameter 6711 (standard) and the 0.508 mm diameter 9011 (thin) seed models (Oncura, Inc., and GE Healthcare, Arlington Heights, IL). Image quality metrics were assessed using the standard deviation of ROIs between the seeds and the contrast to noise ratio (CNR) within the low contrast ROIs. For US images, water phantoms with both single and multiseed arrangements were constructed for both seed sizes. For MR images, both seeds were implanted into a porcine gel and imaged with pelvic imaging protocols. The standard deviation of ROIs and CNR values were used as metrics of artifact quantification. Seed localization within the CT images was assessed using the automated seed finder in a commercial brachytherapy treatment planning system. The number of erroneous seed placements and the average and maximum error in seed placements were recorded as metrics of the localization accuracy.  Results:   With the thin seeds, CT image noise was reduced from 48.5 ± 0.2 to 32.0 ± 0.2 HU and CNR improved by a median value of 74% when compared with the standard seeds. Ultrasound image noise was measured at 50.3 ± 17.1 dB for the thin seed images and 50.0 ± 19.8 dB for the standard seed images, and artifacts directly behind the seeds were smaller and less prominent with the thin seed model. For MR images, CNR of the standard seeds reduced on average 17% when using the thin seeds for all different imaging sequences and seed orientations, but these differences are not appreciable. Automated seed localization required an average (±SD) of 7.0 ± 3.5 manual corrections in seed positions for the thin seed scans and 3.0 ± 1.2 manual corrections in seed positions for the standard seed scans. The average error in seed placement was 1.2 mm for both seed types and the maximum error in seed placement was 2.1 mm for the thin seed scans and 1.8 mm for the standard seed scans.

In this paper, the authors present a deformable prostate phantom for use with multimodal imaging (end-fire or side-fire ultrasound, CT and MRI) and more specifically for transperineal or transrectal needle-insertion procedures. It is made of soft polyvinyl chloride (PVC) plastic and includes a prostate, a perineum, a rectum, a soft periprostatic surrounding and embedded targets for image registration and needle-targeting. Its main particularity is its realistic deformability upon manipulation.  Methods:   After a detailed manufacturing description, the imaging and mechanical characteristics of the phantom are described and evaluated. First, the speed of sound and stress-strain relationship of the PVC material used in the phantom are described, followed by an analysis of its storage, imaging, needle-insertion force, and deformability characteristics.  Results:   The average speed of sound in the phantom was measured to be 1380 ± 20 m/s, while the stress-strain relationship was found to be viscoelastic and in the range of typical prostatic tissues. The mechanical and imaging characteristics of the phantom were found to remain stable at cooler storage temperatures. The phantom had clearly distinguishable morphology in all three imaging modalities, with embedded targets that could be precisely segmented, resulting in an average US-CT rigid registration error of 0.66 mm. The mobility of the phantom prostate upon needle insertion was between 2 and 4 mm, with rotations between 0° and 2°, about the US probe head.  Conclusion:   The phantom's characteristics compare favorably with in vitro and in vivo measurements found in the literature.

However, the current CBCT has poor image qualities mainly due to scatter contamination. Its current clinical application is therefore limited to patient setup based on only bony structures. To improve CBCT imaging for quantitative use, we recently proposed a correction method using planning CT (pCT) as the prior knowledge. Promising phantom results have been obtained on a tabletop CBCT system, using a correction scheme with rigid registration and without iterations. More challenges arise in clinical implementations of our method, especially because patients have large organ deformation in different scans. In this paper, we propose an improved framework to extend our method from bench to bedside by including several new components.  Methods:   The basic principle of our correction algorithm is to estimate the primary signals of CBCT projections via forward projection on the pCT image, and then to obtain the low-frequency errors in CBCT raw projections by subtracting the estimated primary signals and low-pass filtering. We improve the algorithm by using deformable registration to minimize the geometry difference between the pCT and the CBCT images. Since the registration performance relies on the accuracy of the CBCT image, we design an optional iterative scheme to update the CBCT image used in the registration. Large correction errors result from the mismatched objects in the pCT and the CBCT scans. Another optional step of gas pocket and couch matching is added into the framework to reduce these effects.  Results:   The proposed method is evaluated on four prostate patients, of which two cases are presented in detail to investigate the method performance for a large variety of patient geometry in clinical practice. The first patient has small anatomical changes from the planning to the treatment room. Our algorithm works well even without the optional iterations and the gas pocket and couch matching. The image correction on the second patient is more challenging due to the effects of gas pockets and attenuating couch. The improved framework with all new components is used to fully evaluate the correction performance. The enhanced image quality has been evaluated using mean CT number and spatial nonuniformity (SNU) error as well as contrast improvement factor. If the pCT image is considered as the ground truth, on the four patients, the overall mean CT number error is reduced from over 300 HU to below 16 HU in the selected regions of interest (ROIs), and the SNU error is suppressed from over 18% to below 2%. The average soft-tissue contrast is improved by an average factor of 2.6.  Conclusions:   We further improve our pCT-based CBCT correction algorithm for clinical use. Superior correction performance has been demonstrated on four patient studies. By providing quantitative CBCT images, our approach significantly increases the accuracy of advanced CBCT-based clinical applications for IGRT.""","""['Tianye Niu', 'Ahmad Al-Basheer', 'Lei Zhu']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Deep learning methods for enhancing cone-beam CT image quality toward adaptive radiation therapy: A systematic review.', 'Shading correction for on-board cone-beam CT in radiation therapy using planning MDCT images.', 'Planning CT-guided robust and fast cone-beam CT scatter correction using a local filtration technique.', 'Assessing the impact of choosing different deformable registration algorithms on cone-beam CT enhancement by histogram matching.', ""Source-detector trajectory optimization in cone-beam computed tomography: a comprehensive review on today's state-of-the-art."", 'Development and validation of a scatter-corrected CBCT image-guided method for cervical cancer brachytherapy.', 'Deep learning methods for enhancing cone-beam CT image quality toward adaptive radiation therapy: A systematic review.', 'Image-based shading correction for narrow-FOV truncated pelvic CBCT with deep convolutional neural networks and transfer learning.', 'Comparison of Supervised and Unsupervised Approaches for the Generation of Synthetic CT from Cone-Beam CT.', 'Evaluation of an a priori scatter correction algorithm for cone-beam computed tomography based range and dose calculations in proton therapy.']"""

Methods:   Ten consecutive prostate IMRT cases and ten consecutive head and neck IMRT cases were used. Systematic MLC offsets (i.e., calibration error) were introduced for each control point of the plan separately for X1 and X2 leaf banks. Offsets were from - 2 to 2 mm with a 0.5 mm increment. The modified files were imported into the planning system for forward dose recalculation. The original plan served as the reference. The generalized equivalent uniform dose (gEUD) was used as the biological index for the targets, rectum, parotid glands, brainstem, and spinal cord. Each plan was recalculated on a CT scan of a 27 cm diameter cylindrical phantom with a contoured 0.6 cc ion chamber. Dose to ion chamber and 3D gamma analysis were compared to the reference plan. QA pass criteria: (1) at least 95% of voxels with a dose cutoff of 50% of maximum dose have to pass at 3 mm/3% and (2) dose to chamber within 2% of the reference dose.  Results:   For prostate cases, differences in PTV and rectum gEUD greater than 2% were identified. However, a larger proportion of plans leading to greater than 2% difference in prostate PTV gEUD passed the ion chamber QA but not 3D gamma QA. A similar trend was found for the rectum gEUD. For head and neck IMRT, the QA pass criteria flagged plans leading to greater than 4% differences in PTV gEUD and greater than 5% differences in the maximum dose to brainstem. If pass criteria were relaxed to 90% for gamma and 3% for ion chamber QA, plans leading to a 5% difference in PTV gEUD and a 5%-8% difference in brainstem maximum dose would likely pass IMRT QA. A larger proportion of head and neck plans with greater than 2% PTV gEUD difference passed 3D gamma QA compared to ion chamber QA.  Conclusions:   For low modulation plans, there is a better chance to catch MLC calibration errors with 3D gamma QA rather than ion chamber QA. Conversely, for high modulation plans, there is a better chance to catch MLC calibration errors with ion chamber QA rather than with 3D gamma QA. Ion chamber and 3D gamma analysis IMRT QA can detect greater than 2% change in gEUD for PTVs and critical structures for low modulation treatment plans. For high modulation treatment plans, ion chamber and 3D gamma analysis can detect greater than 2% change in gEUD for PTVs and a 5% change in critical structure gEUD since either QA methods passes the QA criteria. For gEUD changes less than those listed above, either QA method has the same proportion of passing rate.""","""['Vitali Moiseenko', 'Vincent Lapointe', 'Kerry James', 'Lingshu Yin', 'Mitchell Liu', 'Todd Pawlicki']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Clinical implementation and error sensitivity of a 3D quality assurance protocol for prostate and thoracic IMRT.', 'Benefit of using biologic parameters (EUD and NTCP) in IMRT optimization for treatment of intrahepatic tumors.', 'IMRT quality assurance using a second treatment planning system.', 'A six-year review of more than 13,000 patient-specific IMRT QA results from 13 different treatment sites.', 'Evaluation of fluence-based dose delivery incorporating the spatial variation of dosimetric leaf gap (DLG).', 'Dosimetric and mechanical equivalency of Varian TrueBeam linear accelerators.', 'Dosimetric and radiobiological characterizations of prostate intensity-modulated radiotherapy and volumetric-modulated arc therapy: A single-institution review of ninety cases.', 'On the sensitivity of TG-119 and IROC credentialing to TPS commissioning errors.', 'Analysis of direct clinical consequences of MLC positional errors in volumetric-modulated arc therapy using 3D dosimetry system.', 'Determining the optimal dosimetric leaf gap setting for rounded leaf-end multileaf collimator systems by simple test fields.']"""

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the dosimetric benefit of curvilinear distribution of seeds for low-dose-rate (LDR) prostate brachytherapy.  Methods:   Twenty LDR prostate brachytherapy cases planned intraoperatively with VariSeed planning system and I-125 seeds were randomly selected as reference rectilinear cases. All the cases were replanned by using curved-needle approach keeping the same individual source strength and the volume receiving 100% of prescribed dose 145 Gy (V(100)). Parameters such as number of needles, seeds, and the dose coverage of the prostate (D(90), V(150), V(200)), urethra (D(30), D(10)) and rectum (D(5), V(100)) were compared for the rectilinear and the curvilinear methods. Statistical significance was assessed using two-tailed student's t-test.  Results:   Reduction of the required number of needles and seeds in curvilinear method were 30.5% (p < 0.001) and 11.8% (p < 0.49), respectively. Dose to the urethra was reduced significantly; D(30) reduced by 10.1% (p < 0.01) and D(10) reduced by 9.9% (p < 0.02). Reduction in rectum dose D(5) was 18.5% (p < 0.03) and V(100) was also reduced from 0.93 cc in rectilinear to 0.21 cc in curvilinear (p < 0.001). Also the V(150) and V(200) coverage of prostate reduced by 18.8% (p < 0.01) and 33.9% (p < 0.001), respectively.  Conclusions:   Significant improvement in the relevant dosimetric parameters was observed in curvilinear needle approach. Prostate dose homogeneity (V(150), V(200)) improved while urethral dose was reduced, which might potentially result in better treatment outcome. Reduction in rectal dose could potentially reduce rectal toxicity and complications. Reduction in number of needles would minimize edema and thereby could improve postimplant urinary incontinence.

During the procedure, needle deflection leads to seed misplacement and suboptimal radiation dose to cancerous cells. In practice, radiation oncologists commonly use high-speed hand needle insertion to minimize displacement of the prostate as well as the needle deflection. Effects of speed during needle insertion and stiffness of trocar (a solid rod inside the hollow cannula) on needle deflection are studied.  Methods:   Needle insertion experiments into phantom were performed using a 2(2) factorial design (2 parameters at 2 levels), with each condition having replicates. Analysis of the deflection data included calculating the average, standard deviation, and analysis of variance (ANOVA) to find significant single and two-way interaction factors.  Results:   The stiffer tungsten carbide trocar is effective in reducing the average and standard deviation of needle deflection.

Materials and methods:   In the 2007-2009 period, at the KCUS Urology Clinic, there were 379 TRUS guided prostate biopsies in 323 patients with known prostate volume. The total of 56 patients (17.3%) underwent the first rebiopsy, primarily due to precancerous lesions. The mean prostate volume, ranges of prostate size, PSAT, PSAD and the number of biopsy samples were analysed retrospectively, and the main characteristics in patients with primarily and rebiopsy diagnosed Pca were evaluated as well.  Results:   The first biopsy cancer detection rate was 29.6% (112/379). The rebiopsy detection rate was 30.3%. There was no statistically significant difference in the prostate volume and the number of biopsy samples among the total number of patients with prostate cancer against the group with benign (suspected) findings. There was a higher Pca detection rate in patients with the prostate volume < 40 cm3 and 40-60 cm3, against the group with the prostate volume > 60 cm3. PSAD was significantly higher in patients with PCa (0.24 vs. 0.18; p = 0.013). The total of 27.2% of the patients with negative biopsy findings and 48% of the patients with diagnosed Pca had PSAD > 0.15. PSAD showed sensitivity and specificity in prostate cancer detection of 50% and 75%, with PPV of 48%. Furthermore, the patients with PSAD >0.15 had a higher Gleason score versus the patients with PSAD < 0.15 (6.7 +/- 2.4 vs. 5.9 +/- 1.7; p < 0.003). A comparison of the main characteristics in patients with primarily and rebiopsy detected prostate cancer gave a statistically significant difference only in the number of biopsy samples (10.9 vs. 14.1, p <.0000).

However, most PCa and PCa cell lines depend on the activity of the AR, and the role of NF-κB in these AR-expressing PCa remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that inhibition of NF-κB signaling by the IKK inhibitor BMS345541 reduced proliferation and increased apoptosis in AR-expressing PCa cell lines. Furthermore, AR activity and target gene expression were distinctively reduced, whereas AR protein levels remained unaltered on BMS345541 treatment. Similar effects were observed particularly after small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of IKK1, but not by siRNA-mediated suppression of IKK2. Moreover, IKK1 overexpression augmented 5α-dihydrotestosterone-induced nuclear AR translocation, whereas nuclear AR was reduced by IKK1 knockdown or BMS345541. However, because IKK1 also enhances the activity of a chronically nuclear AR mutant, modulation of the subcellular distribution seems not to be the only mechanism by which IKK1 enhances AR activity. Finally, reduced in vivo AR phosphorylation after BMS345541 treatment and in vitro AR phosphorylation by IKK1 or IKK2 imply that AR constitutes a novel IKK target. Taken together, our data identify IKK1 as a potentially target structure for future therapeutic intervention in PCa.""","""['Garima Jain', 'Cornelia Voogdt', 'Anna Tobias', 'Klaus-Dieter Spindler', 'Peter Möller', 'Marcus V Cronauer', 'Ralf B Marienfeld']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Neoplasia""","""['IKK inhibitor suppresses epithelial-mesenchymal transition and induces cell death in prostate cancer.', 'RhoA as a mediator of clinically relevant androgen action in prostate cancer cells.', 'Inflammatory NF-kappaB activation promotes hepatic apolipoprotein B100 secretion: evidence for a link between hepatic inflammation and lipoprotein production.', 'IKK biology.', 'NF-κB signaling in prostate cancer: a promising therapeutic target?', 'Role of Metabolism and Metabolic Pathways in Prostate Cancer.', 'Molecular Mechanism of Tanshinone against Prostate Cancer.', 'Phospho Tensin Homolog in Human and Lipid Peroxides in Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells Following Exposure to Flavonoids.', 'Inhibitory-κB Kinase (IKK) α and Nuclear Factor-κB (NFκB)-Inducing Kinase (NIK) as Anti-Cancer Drug Targets.', 'Inflammation and NF-κB Signaling in Prostate Cancer: Mechanisms and Clinical Implications.']"""

However, the influence of testosterone treatment on mortality in men with low testosterone levels is not known.  Objective:   The objective of the study was to examine the association between testosterone treatment and mortality in men with low testosterone levels.  Design:   This was an observational study of mortality in testosterone-treated compared with untreated men, assessed with time-varying, adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression models. Effect modification by age, diabetes, and coronary heart disease was tested a priori.  Setting:   The study was conducted with a clinical database that included seven Northwest Veterans Affairs medical centers.  Patients:   Patients included a cohort of 1031 male veterans, aged older than 40 yr, with low total testosterone [≤250 ng/dl (8.7 nmol/liter)] and no history of prostate cancer, assessed between January 2001 and December 2002 and followed up through the end of 2005.  Main outcome measure:   Total mortality in testosterone-treated compared with untreated men was measured.  Results:   Testosterone treatment was initiated in 398 men (39%) during routine clinical care. The mortality in testosterone-treated men was 10.3% compared with 20.7% in untreated men (P<0.0001) with a mortality rate of 3.4 deaths per 100 person-years for testosterone-treated men and 5.7 deaths per 100 person-years in men not treated with testosterone. After multivariable adjustment including age, body mass index, testosterone level, medical morbidity, diabetes, and coronary heart disease, testosterone treatment was associated with decreased risk of death (hazard ratio 0.61; 95% confidence interval 0.42-0.88; P = 0.008). No significant effect modification was found by age, diabetes, or coronary heart disease.  Conclusions:   In an observational cohort of men with low testosterone levels, testosterone treatment was associated with decreased mortality compared with no testosterone treatment.

Current AR antagonists, such as bicalutamide and hydroxyflutamide, have a low affinity for the AR and as a result block AR signaling insufficiently. Moreover, many patients develop a resistance for bicalutamide or hydroxyflutamide during therapy or show a clinical improvement after withdrawal of the antiandrogen. New and more effective AR antagonists are needed to ensure follow-up of these patients. We therefore developed a screening system to identify novel AR antagonists from a collection of compounds. MEL-3 [8-(propan-2-yl)-5,6-dihydro-4H-pyrazino[3,2,1-jk]carbazole] was selected as potent inhibitor of the AR and was further characterized in vitro. On different prostate cancer cell lines MEL-3 displayed an improved therapeutic profile compared with bicalutamide. Not only cell growth was inhibited but also the expression of androgen-regulated genes: PSA and FKBP5. Prostate cancer is often associated with mutated ARs that respond to a broadened spectrum of ligands including the current antiandrogens used in the clinic, hydroxyflutamide and bicalutamide. The activity of two mutant receptors (AR T877A and AR W741C) was shown to be reduced in presence of MEL-3, providing evidence that MEL-3 can potentially be a follow-up treatment for bicalutamide- and hydroxyflutamide-resistant patients.

Functional interactions between the IGF-I and androgen signaling pathways have crucial roles in the progression of prostate cancer from early to advanced stages. DNA methylation is a major epigenetic alteration affecting gene expression. Hypermethylation of tumor suppressor promoters is a frequent event in human cancer, leading to inactivation and repression of specific genes. The aim of the present study was to identify the entire set of methylated genes (""methylome"") in a cellular model that replicates prostate cancer progression. The methylation profiles of the P69 (early stage, benign) and M12 (advanced stage, metastatic) prostate cancer cell lines were established by treating cells with the demethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-Aza) followed by DNA microarray analysis. Comparative genome-wide methylation analyses of 5-Aza-treated versus untreated cells identified 297 genes overexpressed in P69 and 191 genes overexpressed in M12 cells. 102 genes were upregulated in both benign and metastatic cell lines. In addition, our analyses identified the PITX2 gene as a master regulator upstream of the AR and IGF-IR genes.

This work aims to investigate the roles of each OPN-SI in prostate cancer (PCa) progression by using in vivo and in vitro functional assays.  Methods:   The expression levels of OPN-SI in prostate cell lines were analyzed by qRT-PCR. PC-3 was stably transfected with expression vectors containing OPNa, OPNb, and OPNc, as well as empty vector controls. PC-3 cells overexpressing each construct were analyzed for in vivo tumor growth and in relation to different aspects mimicking tumor progression, such as cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and soft agar colony formation.  Results:   OPN-SI are overexpressed in PCa as compared to non-tumoral prostate cell lines. OPNc and OPNb overexpressing cells significantly activated enhanced xenograft tumor growth and PC-3 proliferation, migration, invasion, and soft agar colony formation, as well as the expression of MMP-2, MMP-9, and VEGF. These isoforms also support sustained proliferative survival. We found that both OPNc and OPNb pro-tumorigenic roles are mainly mediated through PI3K signaling. Inhibition of this pathway by using LY294002 specifically inhibited tumor progression features evoked by OPNc and OPNb overexpression.  Conclusions:   Our data provide evidence that both OPNc and OPNb splicing isoforms promote distinct aspects of PCa progression by inducing PI3K signaling. These data give support to strategies aiming to downregulate OPNc and OPNb expression as an approach to inhibit PCa progression.""","""['Tatiana M Tilli', 'Kivvi D Mello', 'Luciana B Ferreira', 'Aline R Matos', 'Maria Thereza S Accioly', 'Paulo A S Faria', 'Akeila Bellahcène', 'Vincent Castronovo', 'Etel R Gimba']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Re: Both osteopontin-c and osteopontin-b splicing isoforms exert pro-tumorigenic roles in prostate cancer cells.', 'Osteopontin-c splicing isoform contributes to ovarian cancer progression.', 'Osteopontin (OPN/SPP1) isoforms collectively enhance tumor cell invasion and dissemination in esophageal adenocarcinoma.', 'Osteopontin splice variants expression is involved on docetaxel resistance in PC3 prostate cancer cells.', 'Human osteopontin splicing isoforms: known roles, potential clinical applications and activated signaling pathways.', 'Osteopontin b and c Splice isoforms in Leukemias and Solid Tumors: Angiogenesis Alongside Chemoresistance.', 'Quercetin can be a more reliable treatment for metastatic prostate cancer than the localized disease: An in vitro study.', 'Meta-analysis of Osteopontin splice variants in cancer.', 'Osteopontin Splicing Isoforms Contribute to Endometriotic Proliferation, Migration, and Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition in Endometrial Epithelial Cells.', 'PSSNet-An Accurate Super-Secondary Structure for Protein Segmentation.', 'Expression of osteopontin-5 splice variant in the mouse primary and metastatic breast cancer cells.']"""

Sirtinol has been used extensively to identify chemopreventive/chemotherapeutic agents that modulate the sirtuins. However, the molecular effect of sirtinol other than serving as sirtuin inhibitor in cells is less clear. The present study addressed this deficiency in the literature. Based on structural similarity with plant-derived cancer preventive/therapeutic compounds such as 3', 3'-diindolylmethane, resveratrol, and genistein, we hypothesized that sirtinol may act on pathways similar to that affected by these compounds in the human prostate cancer cell LNCaP. We found that treatment of LNCaP cells with sirtinol led to concentration-dependent effects on multiple pathways. Sirtinol inhibited LNCaP cell cycle and growth that was correlated with up-regulation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A mRNA and protein levels. This effect of sirtinol may due in part to modulation of androgen, estrogen, and insulin-like growth factor-1 mediated pathways as sirtinol treatment led to inhibition of mRNA and protein expression of marker genes involved in these pathways. We also found sirtinol activates aryl hydrocarbon-dependent pathways in LNCaP cells. The effects of sirtinol were observed at 25 µM, a concentration lower than Ki (38 µM) for sirtuin activity. Based on these results we reasoned that sirtinol exerts pleiotropic effects in cells and that biological effects of sirtinol may not be due solely to inhibition of sirtuin.""","""['Thomas T Y Wang', 'Norberta W Schoene', 'Eun-Kyung Kim', 'Young S Kim']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Mol Carcinog""","""['A role for SIRT1 in cell growth and chemoresistance in prostate cancer PC3 and DU145 cells.', 'Sirt1 inhibitor, Sirtinol, induces senescence-like growth arrest with attenuated Ras-MAPK signaling in human cancer cells.', ""Broccoli-derived phytochemicals indole-3-carbinol and 3,3'-diindolylmethane exerts concentration-dependent pleiotropic effects on prostate cancer cells: comparison with other cancer preventive phytochemicals."", 'Sirtuin activators and inhibitors.', 'Sirtuin inhibitors as anticancer agents.', 'Putative involvement of sirtuin modulators in LPS-induced sickness behaviour in mice.', 'SIRT1 inhibition-induced senescence as a strategy to prevent prostate cancer progression.', 'Development of a NanoBRET assay to validate inhibitors of Sirt2-mediated lysine deacetylation and defatty-acylation that block prostate cancer cell migration.', 'Metal-binding effects of sirtuin inhibitor sirtinol.', 'Investigating the role of Sirtuins in cell reprogramming.']"""

WebChoice is an Internet-based, interactive health communication application that allows cancer patients to monitor their symptoms and problems, provides individually tailored information and self-management support, e-communication with expert cancer nurses, and an e-forum for group discussion with other patients.  Objective:   The objective of this study was to examine the effects of WebChoice on symptom distress (primary outcome), depression, self-efficacy, health-related quality of life, and social support (secondary outcomes).  Methods:   In this 1-year repeated-measures randomized controlled trial, 325 breast and prostate cancer patients were randomized into 1 experimental group with access to WebChoice and 1 control group who received URLs of publicly available cancer Web sites.  Results:   Group differences on symptom distress were significant only for the global symptom distress index on the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale (slope estimate, -0.052 [95% confidence interval, -0.101 to -0.004]; t = 4.42; P = .037). There were no significant group differences on secondary outcomes. Additional analyses showed significant within-group improvements in depression in the experimental group only. In the control group, self-efficacy and health-related quality of life deteriorated significantly over time.  Conclusion:   This randomized controlled trial is one of the first to evaluate effects of an interactive health communication application to support cancer patients in illness management on symptoms. Although only 1 hypothesis was partially supported, the combined results show a clear trend toward better scores in the intervention group on most outcome measures.

Objective:   The objective of the study was to assess sociodemographic, clinical, and psychosocial factors associated with physical and mental health QOL (PHQOL and MHQOL) among African American and white cancer survivors.  Methods:   Patients were recruited from tumor registries. Telephone interviews were conducted with 248 African American and 244 white respondents with a history of breast, prostate, or colorectal cancers. Multivariate regression models were used to assess what factors were associated with PHQOL and MHQOL.  Results:   Key racial differences in adjusted analyses included poorer MHQOL scores among African Americans compared with white survivors. Furthermore, race moderated the relationship between perceived social support and MHQOL, where higher social support levels were associated with increased MHQOL among African Americans. Other correlates of QOL impacted racial groups similarly. For example, factors associated with PHQOL scores included being unemployed, being uninsured, the presence of medical comorbidities, a longer time since diagnosis, and higher levels of cancer-related stress appraisals. Factors associated with MHQOL scores included being unemployed, higher levels of daily stress, higher levels of stress associated with the diagnosis, higher levels of education, higher levels of perceived social support, and higher levels of spirituality.  Conclusion:   Interventions aimed at increasing social support may have important implications for improving QOL outcomes among African Americans.

It has been suggested that this lesion is of renal tubular cell origin or differentiation. Immunohistochemical studies of NA emphasize its staining with α-methylacyl-coenzyme A racemase (AMACR), and prostatic adenocarcinoma may be a possible differential diagnosis. This reactivity was recently discussed as an artifact due to endogenous biotin. Kidney-specific cadherin (Ksp-cad) is a marker of distal nephron. CD10 and KIT are also expressed in the kidney. We studied the immunohistochemical expression of AMACR, p63, Ksp-cad, CD10, and KIT in 9 cases of NA (forming a total of 12 lesions). Practically all of the lesions stained for AMACR with 2 different antibodies and 2 high-sensitivity (multimer or polymer based) biotin-free methods (83% and 100%). The staining was similar for both methods in 9 of these 12 lesions. All of the NAs were negative for p63 and KIT, except 1 case, with focal reactivity for KIT. CD10 was expressed very focally in 4 of the 12 lesions (33%). We observed weak staining for Ksp-cad in 6 lesions (50%) and 3 (25%) showed a moderate positivity in 15% to 50% of the cells. In conclusion, positivity of NA for AMACR is not an artifact, as we confirmed using 2 different methods. Besides, p63, a basal cell marker, is usually negative. Immunoreactivity for Ksp-cad seems to support the differentiation of NA to distal nephron cells, at least in some of the cases.

Previous studies have suggested that Wnt pathway inhibitory genes are silenced by CpG hypermethylation, and other studies have suggested that genistein can demethylate hypermethylated DNA. Genistein is a soy isoflavone with diverse effects on cellular proliferation, survival, and gene expression that suggest it could be a potential therapeutic agent for prostate cancer. We undertook the present study to investigate the effects of genistein on the epigenome of prostate cancer cells and to discover novel combination approaches of other compounds with genistein that might be of translational utility. Here, we have investigated the effects of genistein on several prostate cancer cell lines, including the ARCaP-E/ARCaP-M model of the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), to analyze effects on their epigenetic state. In addition, we investigated the effects of combined treatment of genistein with the histone deacetylase inhibitor vorinostat on survival in prostate cancer cells.  Methods:   Using whole genome expression profiling and whole genome methylation profiling, we have determined the genome-wide differences in genetic and epigenetic responses to genistein in prostate cancer cells before and after undergoing the EMT. Also, cells were treated with genistein, vorinostat, and combination treatment, where cell death and cell proliferation was determined.  Results:   Contrary to earlier reports, genistein did not have an effect on CpG methylation at 20 μM, but it did affect histone H3K9 acetylation and induced increased expression of histone acetyltransferase 1 (HAT1). In addition, genistein also had differential effects on survival and cooperated with the histone deacteylase inhibitor vorinostat to induce cell death and inhibit proliferation.  Conclusion:   Our results suggest that there are a number of pathways that are affected with genistein and vorinostat treatment such as Wnt, TNF, G2/M DNA damage checkpoint, and androgen signaling pathways. In addition, genistein cooperates with vorinostat to induce cell death in prostate cancer cell lines with a greater effect on early stage prostate cancer.""","""['Cornel J Phillip', 'Christopher K Giardina', 'Birdal Bilir', 'David J Cutler', 'Yu-Heng Lai', 'Omer Kucuk', 'Carlos S Moreno']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Effectiveness of the histone deacetylase inhibitor (S)-2 against LNCaP and PC3 human prostate cancer cells.', 'Combining histone deacetylase inhibitor vorinostat with aurora kinase inhibitors enhances lymphoma cell killing with repression of c-Myc, hTERT, and microRNA levels.', 'DNA microarray profiling of genes differentially regulated by the histone deacetylase inhibitors vorinostat and LBH589 in colon cancer cell lines.', 'New clinical developments in histone deacetylase inhibitors for epigenetic therapy of cancer.', 'Impact of soy isoflavones on the epigenome in cancer prevention.', 'Neuromodulating roles of estrogen and phytoestrogens in cognitive therapeutics through epigenetic modifications during aging.', 'A Mini-Review of Flavone Isomers Apigenin and Genistein in Prostate Cancer Treatment.', 'Targeting Histone Deacetylases: Opportunities for Cancer Treatment and Chemoprevention.', 'Dietary Phytoestrogens and Their Metabolites as Epigenetic Modulators with Impact on Human Health.', 'Studies of hormonal regulation, phenotype plasticity, bone metastasis, and experimental therapeutics in androgen-repressed human prostate cancer (ARCaP) model.']"""

Methods and materials:   Records of 204 hormone-naïve patients with localized adenocarcinoma of the prostate treated at St. Mary's Regional Medical Center in Reno, NV, and at Carson Tahoe Regional Medical Center in Carson City, NV, between 1998 and 2003, using I-125 or Pd-103 seed brachytherapy, were retrospectively analyzed. Treatment planning was done using a preplanned, modified peripheral loading technique. A total of 185 of 204 patients had PSA records at 12 months after implant. Variables included were age, initial pretreatment PSA, Gleason score, T stage, National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) risk group (RG), perineural invasion (PNI), external beam boost, dose, and ptPSA levels at 12 months with cutpoints at ≤1, 1.01 to 2.00, 2.01 to 3.00, and >3.00 ng/ml.  Results:   Median follow-up was 80 months, and median age was 69 years. The numbers of patients stratified by NCCN low, intermediate, and high RG were 110:65:10, respectively. Monotherapy and boost prescription doses were 145 Gy and 110 Gy for I-125, and 125 Gy and 100 Gy for Pd-103 seeds, respectively. The median dose (D90) was 95.4% of the prescribed dose. The 5-year PRFS at the 12-months ptPSA levels of ≤1, 1.01 to 2.00, 2.01 to 3.00, and >3.00 ng/ml were 98.5%, 85.7%, 61.5%, and 22.2%, respectively. The 10-year PRFS at the 12-months ptPSA levels of ≤1 and 1.01 to 2.00 ng/ml were 90.5% and 85.7%, respectively. In multivariate analysis, both ptPSA and PNI were significant independent predictors of PRFS. Hazard ratios (HR) for ptPSA levels at ≤1, 1.01 to 2.00, 2.01 to 3.00, and >3.00 ng/ml at 12 months were 1, 4.96, 27.57, and 65.10, respectively. PNI had an HR of 6.1 (p=0.009).

In this work, hydrazide-based chemistry was used to identify N-linked glycopeptides from 22Rv1 prostate cancer cells cultured in vitro, which were compared with glycopeptides identified from explanted 22Rv1 murine tumor xenografts. One hundred and four human glycoproteins were identified in the former analysis and 75 in the latter, with 40 proteins overlapping between data sets. Of the 40 overlapping proteins, 80% have multiple literature references to the neoplastic process and ∼40% to prostatic neoplasms. These include a number of well-known prostate cancer-associated biomarkers, such as prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA). By integrating gene expression data and available literature, we identified members of the overlap data set that deserve consideration as potential prostate cancer biomarkers. Specifically, the identification of the extracellular domain of protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type F (PTPRF) was of particular interest due to the direct involvement of PTPRF in the control of β-catenin signaling, as well as dramatically elevated gene expression levels in the prostate compared to other tissues. In this investigation, we demonstrate that the PTPRF E-subunit is more abundant in human prostate tumor tissue compared to normal control and also detectable in murine plasma by immunoblot and ELISA. Specifically, PTPRF distinguishes between animals xenografted with the 22Rv1 cells and control animals as early as 14 days after implantation. This result suggests that the ectodomain of PTPRF has the potential to function as a novel plasma or tissue-based biomarker for prostate cancer. The workflow described adds to the literature of potential biomarker candidates for prostate cancer and demonstrates a pathway to developing new diagnostic assays.""","""['Theodore E Whitmore', 'Amelia Peterson', 'Ted Holzman', 'Ashley Eastham', 'Lynn Amon', 'Martin McIntosh', 'Adrian Ozinsky', 'Peter S Nelson', 'Daniel B Martin']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""J Proteome Res""","""['Proteomic analysis of conditioned media from the PC3, LNCaP, and 22Rv1 prostate cancer cell lines: discovery and validation of candidate prostate cancer biomarkers.', 'Establishment of a serum tumor marker for preclinical trials of mouse prostate cancer models.', 'Gene expression profiles of prostate cancer stem cells isolated by aldehyde dehydrogenase activity assay.', 'The role of tissue microarrays in prostate cancer biomarker discovery.', 'Discovery of prostate cancer biomarkers by microarray gene expression profiling.', 'Liprins in oncogenic signaling and cancer cell adhesion.', 'Mapping human N-linked glycoproteins and glycosylation sites using mass spectrometry.', 'N-GlycositeAtlas: a database resource for mass spectrometry-based human N-linked glycoprotein and glycosylation site mapping.', 'Identification of Core Genes and Key Pathways via Integrated Analysis of Gene Expression and DNA Methylation Profiles in Bladder Cancer.', 'Site-Specific Profiling of Serum Glycoproteins Using N-Linked Glycan and Glycosite Analysis Revealing Atypical N-Glycosylation Sites on Albumin and α-1B-Glycoprotein.']"""

This platform consists of 64 antigen-decorated CdS nanorod spots with the diameter of 1.0 cm uniformly distributed on 16 indium tin oxide (ITO) strips, which is coated with a multichannel decorated polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) slice to realize multiplexed determination of antigens. To shorten the immune reaction time in the microchannels and simplify the device, magnetic stirring and four-channel universal serial bus (USB) ports for plug-and-play were used. When Ru(bpy)(3)(2+) labeled antibodies were selectively captured by the corresponding antigens on the CdS nanorod spot array, ECL-RET from the CdS nanorod (donor) by cathodic emission in the presence of K(2)S(2)O(8) to Ru(bpy)(3)(2+) (acceptor) occurred. With signal amplification of Ru(bpy)(3)(2+) and competitive immunoassay, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), α-fetoprotein (AFP), and prostate specific antigen (PSA) as models were detected on this microfluidic device via recording the increased ECL-RET signals on electrode surfaces. Furthermore, this multiplexed competitive immunoassay was successfully used for detecting cancer cell surface antigens via the specific antibody-cell interactions and cell counting via cell surface receptors and antigens on the CdS nanorod surface.

It is known to provide valuable information on disease state and grade based on lipid profiles in tissue sections. Comprehensive exploration of the spatial and chemical information contained in 2D MS images requires further development of methods for data treatment and interpretation in conjunction with multivariate analysis. In this study, we employ an interactive approach based on principal component analysis (PCA) to interpret the chemical and spatial information obtained from MS imaging of human bladder, kidney, germ cell and prostate cancer and adjacent normal tissues. This multivariate strategy facilitated distinction between tumor and normal tissue by correlating the lipid information with pathological evaluation of the same samples. Some common lipid ions, such as those of m/z 885.5 and m/z 788.5, nominally PI(18 : 0/20 : 4) and PS(18 : 0/18 : 1), as well as ions of free fatty acids and their dimers, appeared to be highly characterizing for different types of human cancers, while other ions, such as those of m/z 465.5 (cholesterol sulfate) for prostate cancer tissue and m/z 795.5 (seminolipid 16 : 0/16 : 0) for germ tissue, appeared to be extremely selective for the type of tissue analyzed. These data confirm that lipid profiles can reflect not only the disease/health state of tissue but also are characteristic of tissue type. The manual interactive strategy presented here is particularly useful to visualize the information contained in hyperspectral MS images by automatically connecting regions of PCA score space to pixels of the 2D physical object.

In the adult male host, however, most high affinity T cells targeting these potential tumor rejection antigens will be removed during negative selection. In contrast, the female mature T-cell repertoire should contain abundant precursors capable of recognizing these classes of prostate cancer antigens and mediating effective anti-tumor immune responses.  Methodology/principal findings:   We find that syngeneic TRAMP-C2 prostatic adenocarcinoma cells are spontaneously rejected in female hosts. Adoptive transfer of naïve female lymphocytes to irradiated male hosts bearing pre-implanted TRAMP-C2 tumor cells slows tumor growth and mediates tumor rejection in some animals. The success of this adoptive transfer was dependent on the transfer of female CD4 T cells and independent of the presence of CD25-expressing regulatory T cells in the transferred lymphocytes. We identify in female CD4 T cells stimulated with TRAMP-C2 a dominant MHC II-restricted response to the Y-chromosome antigen DBY. Furthermore, CD8 T cell responses in female lymphocytes to the immunodominant MHC I-restricted antigen SPAS-1 are markedly increased compared to male mice. Finally, we find no exacerbation of graft-versus-host disease in either syngeneic or minor-antigen mismatched allogeneic lymphocyte adoptive transfer models by using female into male versus male into male cells.  Conclusions/significance:   This study shows that adoptively transferred female lymphocytes, particularly CD4 T cells, can control the outgrowth of pre-implanted prostatic adenocarcinoma cells. This approach does not significantly worsen graft-versus-host responses suggesting it may be viable in the clinic. Further, enhancing the available immune repertoire with female-derived T cells may provide an excellent pool of prostate cancer reactive T cells for further augmentation by combination with either vaccination or immune regulatory blockade strategies.""","""['Robert R Jenq', 'Michael A Curran', 'Gabrielle L Goldberg', 'Chen Liu', 'James P Allison', 'Marcel R M van den Brink']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Killing of rat adenocarcinoma 13762 in situ by adoptive transfer of CD4+ anti-tumor T cells requires tumor expression of cell surface MHC class II molecules.', 'Immunity to murine prostatic tumors: continuous provision of T-cell help prevents CD8 T-cell tolerance and activates tumor-infiltrating dendritic cells.', 'Persistence, immune specificity, and functional ability of murine mutant ras epitope-specific CD4(+) and CD8(+) T lymphocytes following in vivo adoptive transfer.', 'Central and effector memory CD4 and CD8 T-cell responses to tumor-associated antigens.', 'Adoptive transfer of allogeneic antigen-specific T cells.', 'Sex-biased adaptive immune regulation in cancer development and therapy.', 'To Remember or to Forget: The Role of Good and Bad Memories in Adoptive T Cell Therapy for Tumors.', 'Inhibitory effects of human lactoferrin on U14 cervical carcinoma through upregulation of the immune response.']"""

The process of averaging reduces the problem of clinical heterogeneity while simultaneously minimizing sample handling.  Methodology/principal findings:   RNA was isolated from the blood of prostate cancer patients and healthy controls. Samples were pooled and subjected to the averaged differential display process. Transcripts present at different levels between patients and controls were purified and sequenced for identification. Transcript levels in the blood of prostate cancer patients and controls were verified by quantitative RT-PCR. Means were compared using a t-test and a receiver-operating curve was generated. The Ring finger protein 19A (RNF19A) transcript was identified as having higher levels in prostate cancer patients compared to healthy men through the averaged differential display process. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis confirmed a more than 2-fold higher level of RNF19A mRNA levels in the blood of patients with prostate cancer than in healthy controls (p = 0.0066). The accuracy of distinguishing cancer patients from healthy men using RNF19A mRNA levels in blood as determined by the area under the receiving operator curve was 0.727.  Conclusions/significance:   Averaged differential display offers a simplified approach for the comprehensive screening of body fluids, such as blood, to identify biomarkers in patients with prostate cancer.

However, it is very important to understand the mechanism responsible for this activation and the relation between them. Here, we report the mechanism of EGFR expression by transcriptionally active β-catenin in GSK3β-inactivated prostate cancer cells that eventually leads to its enhanced proliferation and survival. Expressions of β-catenin and EGFR are elevated in various cancers specifically in prostate cancer cells, DU145. When GSK3β is inactivated in these cells, β-catenin gets stabilized, phosphorylated at Ser-552 by protein kinase A, accumulates in the nucleus, and regulates the expression of its target genes that include EGFR. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and promoter analysis revealed that the EGFR promoter gets occupied by transcriptionally active β-catenin when elevated in GSK3β-inactivated cells. This phenomenon not only leads to increased expression of EGFR but also initiates the activation of its downstream molecules such as ERK1/2 and Stat3, ultimately resulting in up-regulation of multiple genes involved in cell proliferation and survival.""","""['Kiran Kumar Naidu Guturi', 'Tapashi Mandal', 'Anirban Chatterjee', 'Moumita Sarkar', 'Seemana Bhattacharya', 'Uttara Chatterjee', 'Mrinal K Ghosh']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""J Biol Chem""","""['Epidermal growth factor receptor regulates beta-catenin location, stability, and transcriptional activity in oral cancer.', 'Proline oxidase, a p53-induced gene, targets COX-2/PGE2 signaling to induce apoptosis and inhibit tumor growth in colorectal cancers.', 'Activation of beta-catenin signalling increases StarD7 gene expression in JEG-3 cells.', 'Inappropriate activation of androgen receptor by relaxin via beta-catenin pathway.', 'Multifaceted interaction between the androgen and Wnt signaling pathways and the implication for prostate cancer.', 'Upregulated Expression of ErbB1 in Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma as a Predictor of Poor Overall Survival Outcome.', 'ERBB1/EGFR and JAK3 Tyrosine Kinases as Potential Therapeutic Targets in High-Risk Multiple Myeloma.', 'Pathogenic Role of Diabetes-Induced Overexpression of Kallistatin in Corneal Wound Healing Deficiency Through Inhibition of Canonical Wnt Signaling.', 'Substratum stiffness regulates Erk signaling dynamics through receptor-level control.', 'The deubiquitinase UCHL1 regulates cardiac hypertrophy by stabilizing epidermal growth factor receptor.']"""

Patients and methods:   Men with prostate cancer who lacked radiographically detectable metastases were treated in a prospective trial of IAD. After 9 months of treatment with leuprolide and flutamide, androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) was stopped until prostate-specific antigen reached a threshold (1 ng/mL for radical prostatectomy; 4 ng/mL for radiation or primary ADT) for a new cycle. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans were performed before starting ADT and subsequently with each change in therapy. At least two consecutive DXA scans were required for this analysis. Computed tomography, bone scintigraphy, and lumbar spine x-rays were performed at the beginning and end of each treatment period.  Results:   Fifty-six of 100 patients met criteria for this analysis.

Patients and methods:   Ninety-two operated prostate cancer patients were retrospectively reviewed. No patient had previously received hormonal treatment. The investigated variables included PRL, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), total testosterone (TT), free testosterone (FT), total prostate specific antigen (PSA), percentage of positive cores at transrectal ultrasound scan biopsy (TRUSB) (P+), biopsy Gleason score (bGS), pathology Gleason score (pGS), estimated tumor volume in relation to percentage of prostate volume (V+), overall prostate weight (Wi) and age. Empirical PRL correlations and multiple linear predictions were investigated along the pituitary testis prostate axis in the different groups of the prostate cancer population and clustered according to pT (2a/b, 3a, 3b/4) status. The patient population was classified according to the log(10) PRL/V+ ratio and clustered as follows: group A (log(10) PRL/V+ ≤1.5), B (1.5< log(10)PRL/V+ ≤2.0) and C (log(10) PRL/V+ >2.0). Simple linear regression analysis of V+ predicting PRL was computed for assessing the clustered model and analysis of variance was performed for assessing significant differences between the groups.  Results:   PRL was independently predicted by FSH (p=0.01), LH (p=0.008) and P+ (p=0.06) in low-stage prostate cancer (pT2a/b). Interestingly, PRL was independently predicted by LH (p=0.03) and FSH, TT, FT, PSA, bGS, pGS, V+, Wi and age (all at p=0.01) in advanced stage-disease (pT3b/4). V+ was also significantly correlated (r=0.47) and predicted by P+ (p<0.0001) in the prostate cancer population. PRL was significantly correlated and predicted by V+ when the patient population was clustered according to the log(10)PRL/V+ ratio in group A (p=0.008), B (p<0.0001) and C (p<0.0001). Moreover, the three groups had significantly different mean values of PRL (p<0.0001), PSA (p=0.007), P+ (p=0.0001), V+ (p<0.0001), Wi (p=0.03), bGS (p=0.008), pGS (p=0.003); also, groups A, B and C had significant different pGS (p=0.03), pT (p=0.0008) and pR (p=0.01) frequency distributions.  Conclusion:   At diagnosis, in an operated prostate cancer population, PRL was significantly correlated and independently predicted along the pituitary testis prostate axis in high-stage disease; V+ was also significantly correlated and predicted by P+. Because of the high correlation and prediction of PRL by both V+ and P+, the prostate cancer population at diagnosis was clustered according to the log(10)PRL/V+ ratio into groups A, B and C that, in theory, might be models with prognostic potential and clinical applications in the prostate cancer population.

In ovarian carcinogenesis, oestrogen may play a role. As oestrogen seems to mediate at least some of its biological effects through serotonin, we decided to evaluate if serotonin receptors are expressed in ovary and in ovarian tumours and if the expression is correlated to ovarian tumour development.  Materials and methods:   An immunohistochemical study of the serotonin (5-HT) receptors 5-HTR1A, 5-HTR1B, 5-HTR2B and 5-HTR4 in frozen samples of ovary, and benign, borderline and invasive ovarian tumours was performed.  Results:   Expression of all four serotonin receptors was strong to intermediate in the ovarian epithelium. In benign and non-invasive cancer cells, strong staining was seen, while in invasive cancer cells, decreased expression was observed. For 5-HTR2B, the decrease was correlated to dissemination of the disease. For none of the serotonin receptors was the expression correlated to survival. In the stromal part, a variable immunoreactivity was observed that was strongest for 5-HTR2B in both ovary and tumours. Staining of blood vessels was observed in ovary and all tumour groups for 5-HTR2B, but only occasionally was a weak expression seen for 5-HTR1A, 5-HTR1B and 5-HTR4.  Conclusion:   The staining pattern of serotonin receptors in ovary indicates their functional role in ovarian physiology. In ovarian tumours, the expression is in harmony with a tumour suppressor role in ovarian carcinogenesis, which is supported by observations in the literature.

In this study, a chemical genetic approach was used to identify malignant targets of Aurora A, which revealed LIMK2 as a novel Aurora A substrate. Aurora A regulates LIMK2 kinase activity, subcellular localization and protein levels by direct phosphorylation at S283, T494 and T505. In response, LIMK2 also positively regulates the level of Aurora A, thereby engaging in a positive-feedback loop, promoting Aurora-A-mediated oncogenic pathways. Most importantly, LIMK2 ablation fully abrogates Aurora-A-mediated tumorigenesis in nude mice, suggesting that LIMK2 is a key oncogenic effector of Aurora A. Furthermore, LIMK2 ablation acts synergistically with inhibition of Aurora A in promoting cell death. Finally, Aurora-A-mediated upregulation of LIMK2 appears to be a common mechanism in many cancers.

IMRT is an innovative treatment for prostate cancer that delivers higher doses of radiation with improved precision compared to alternative radiotherapies. We observed rapid adoption of this new treatment among men diagnosed with prostate cancer from 2001 through 2007, despite uncertainty about its relative effectiveness. We compared patient and disease characteristics of those receiving IMRT and the previous radiation standard of care, three-dimensional conformal therapy; assessed intermediate-term outcomes; and examined potential factors associated with the increased use of IMRT. We found that in the early period of IMRT adoption (2001-03) men with high-risk disease were more likely to receive IMRT, whereas after IMRT's initial dissemination (2004-07) men with low-risk disease had fairly similar likelihoods of receiving IMRT as men with high-risk disease. This raises concerns about overtreatment, as well as considerable health care costs, because treatment with IMRT costs $15,000-$20,000 more than other standard therapies.

This study examined Medicare claims for men in a set of geographically dispersed counties to determine how the ""in-office ancillary services"" exception affected the use of surgical pathology services and cancer detection rates associated with prostate biopsies. I found that self-referring urologists billed Medicare for 4.3 more specimens per prostate biopsy than the adjusted mean of 6 specimens per biopsy that non-self-referring urologists sent to independent pathology providers, a difference of almost 72 percent. Additionally, the regression-adjusted cancer detection rate in 2007 was twelve percentage points higher for men treated by urologists who did not self-refer.

Design:   Linkage study with multivariable competing risks flexible parametric survival model to examine the incidence of new diagnoses of cancer in patients with metal-on-metal hip replacement compared with those with alternative bearings and to compare the observed incidence of diagnoses in patients undergoing hip replacement with that predicted by national incidence rates in the general population.  Setting:   National Joint Registry of England and Wales (NJR) linked to NHS hospital episode statistics data.  Participants:   40,576 patients with hip replacement with metal-on-metal bearing surfaces and 248,995 with alternative bearings.  Main outcome measures:   Incidence of all cancers and incidence of malignant melanoma and prostate, renal tract, and haematological cancers.  Results:   The incidence of new diagnoses of cancer was low after hip replacement (1.25% at one year, 95% confidence interval 1.21% to 1.30%) and lower than that predicted from the age and sex matched normal population (1.65%, 1.60% to 1.70%). Compared with alternative bearings, there was no evidence that metal-on-metal bearing surfaces were associated with an increased risk of any cancer diagnosis in the seven years after surgery (mean follow-up of three years, 23% (n=67,361) of patients observed for five years or more). Similarly, there was no increase in the risk of malignant melanoma or haematological, prostate, and renal tract cancers. The adjusted five year incidence of all cancers for men aged 60 was 4.8% (4.4% to 5.3%) with resurfacing, 6.2% (5.7% to 6.7%) with stemmed metal-on-metal, and 6.7% (6.5% to 7.0%) for other bearing surfaces. Equivalent rates for women aged 60 were lower: 3.1% (2.8% to 3.4%) with resurfacing, 4.0% (3.7% to 4.3%) with stemmed metal-on-metal, and 4.4% (4.2% to 4.5%) with other bearings.  Conclusions:   These data are reassuring, but the findings are observational with short follow-up. The use of hospital episode statistics data might underestimate cancer diagnoses, and there is the possibility of confounding by indication.

Rottlerin, a natural polyphenolic component, synergistically increased PC-3 (a HRPC cell line) apoptosis induced by camptothecin (a topoisomerase I inhibitor). Using siRNA technique to knockdown protein kinase C-δ (PKCδ), the data showed that rottlerin-mediated synergistic effect was PKCδ-independent, although rottlerin has been used as a PKCδ inhibitor. Rottlerin potentiated camptothecin-induced DNA fragmentation at S phase and ATM phosphorylation at Ser1981. The effect was correlated to apoptosis (r2 = 0.9). To detect upstream signals, the data showed that camptothecin acted on and stabilized topoisomerase I-DNA complex, leading to the formation of camptothecin-trapped cleavage complexes (TOP1cc). The effect was potentiated by rottlerin. To determine DNA repair capability, the time-related γH2A.X formation was examined after camptothecin removal. Consequently, rottlerin significantly inhibited camptothecin removal-mediated decline of γH2A.X formation at S phase, indicating the impairment of DNA repair activity in the presence of rottlerin. The combinatory treatment of camptothecin and rottlerin induced conformational change and activation of Bax and formation of truncated Bad, suggesting the contribution of mitochondria stress to apoptosis. In summary, the data suggest that rottlerin-mediated camptothecin sensitization is through the augmented stabilization of TOP1cc, leading to an increase of DNA damage stress and, possibly, an impairment of DNA repair capability. Subsequently, mitochondria-involved apoptosis is triggered through Bax activation and truncated Bad formation. The novel discovery may provide an anticancer approach of combinatory use between rottlerin and camptothecin for the treatment of HRPCs.""","""['Jui-Ling Hsu', 'Yunn-Fang Ho', 'Tsai-Kun Li', 'Ching-Shih Chen', 'Lih-Ching Hsu', 'Jih-Hwa Guh']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Biochem Pharmacol""","""['Dual action of NSC606985 on cell growth and apoptosis mediated through PKCδ in prostatic cancer cells.', 'A novel small molecule hybrid of vorinostat and DACA displays anticancer activity against human hormone-refractory metastatic prostate cancer through dual inhibition of histone deacetylase and topoisomerase I.', 'Rottlerin inhibits migration of follicular thyroid carcinoma cells by PKCdelta-independent destabilization of the focal adhesion complex.', 'Rottlerin: an inappropriate and ineffective inhibitor of PKCdelta.', 'Rottlerin and cancer: novel evidence and mechanisms.', 'Construction of Bone Metastasis-Specific Regulation Network Based on Prognostic Stemness-Related Signatures in Prostate Cancer.', 'Co-administration of tyrosine kinase inhibitors with rottlerin in metastatic prostate cancer cells.', 'Protease Nexin I is a feedback regulator of EGF/PKC/MAPK/EGR1 signaling in breast cancer cells metastasis and stemness.', 'Enhanced Liver Targeting of Camptothecin via Conjugation with Deoxycholic Acid.', 'Tumor suppressive role of rottlerin in cancer therapy.']"""

Methods:   PC-3 cells were treated with various concentrations of docetaxel or (and) ABT-737. Cell viability was determined using MTT assay. Apoptosis was assessed by fluorescence microscopy analysis of cells with condensed and segmented nuclei following staining with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Cellular DNA was stained with propidium iodide and flow cytometric analysis was performed to analyze the cell cycle distribution.

Patients and methods:   From July 2008 to July 2010, 357 patients underwent RALP. Of these, 19 (5.3%) patients had undergone previous TURP. Operative and perioperative data of patients were compared with those of matched controls selected from a database of 616 post-RRP patients. Matching criteria were age, clinical stage, the level of preoperative prostate-specific-antigen, the biopsy Gleason score, the American Society of Anesthesiologists classification score, and prostate volume assessed during transrectal ultrasonography. All RRP and RALP procedures were performed by experienced surgeons.  Results:   Mean time to prostatectomy was 67.4 months in the RALP group and 53.1 months in the RRP group. Mean operative time was 217 ± 51.9 minutes for RALP and 174 ± 57.7 minutes for RRP (P<0.05). The overall positive surgical margin rate was 15.8% in both groups (pT(2) tumors: 10.5% for RALP and 5.3% for RRP; P=1.0). Mean estimated blood loss was 333 ± 144 mL in RALP patients and 1103 ± 636 mL in RRP patients (P<0.001). The difference between preoperative and postoperative hemoglobin levels was 3.22 ± 0.98 g/dL for RALP and 5.85 ± 1.95 g/dL for RRP (P=0.0002). The RALP and RRP groups also differed in terms of hospital stay (8.58 ± 1.17 vs 11.74 ± 5.22 days; P=0.0037), duration of catheterization (7.95 ± 5.69 vs 11.78 ± 6.97 days; P=0.0016), postoperative complications according to the Clavien classification system (6 vs 15 patients; P=0.0027), and transfusion rate (0% vs 10.5%; P<0.001).  Conclusion:   RALP offers advantages over open radical prostatectomy after previous surgery. Although both techniques are associated with adequate surgical outcomes, RALP appeared to be preferable in our population of patients with previous prostate surgery.""","""['Andreas Martinschek', 'Kathrin Heinzelmann', 'Manuel Ritter', 'Elmar Heinrich', 'Lutz Trojan']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""J Endourol""","""['Robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy versus open: comparison of the learning curve of a single surgeon.', 'Surgical, oncologic, and short-term functional outcomes in patients undergoing robot-assisted prostatectomy after previous transurethral resection of the prostate.', 'Comparative analysis of surgical margins between radical retropubic prostatectomy and RALP: are patients sacrificed during initiation of robotics program?', 'Radical prostatectomy: a comparison of open, laparoscopic and robot-assisted laparoscopic techniques.', 'Retropubic, laparoscopic, and robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: a systematic review and cumulative analysis of comparative studies.', 'Robotic assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy following open trans-vesical adenomectomy: A single centre experience and review of the literature.', 'Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy Is More Beneficial for Prostate Cancer Patients: A System Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'Comparison of Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy and Open Radical Prostatectomy Outcomes: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'Robotic radical prostatectomy in patients with previous prostate surgery and radiotherapy.']"""

Thus antagonists that inhibit ephrin binding to EphA4 could be useful for a variety of research and therapeutic applications. In the present study we characterize the binding features of three antagonistic peptides (KYL, APY and VTM) that selectively target EphA4 among the Eph receptors. Isothermal titration calorimetry analysis demonstrated that all three peptides bind to the ephrin-binding domain of EphA4 with low micromolar affinity. Furthermore, the effects of a series of EphA4 mutations suggest that the peptides interact in different ways with the ephrin-binding pocket of EphA4. Chemical-shift changes observed by NMR spectroscopy upon binding of the KYL peptide involve many EphA4 residues, consistent with extensive interactions and possibly receptor conformational changes. Additionally, systematic replacement of each of the 12 amino acids of KYL and VTM identify the residues critical for EphA4, binding. The peptides exhibit a long half-life in cell culture medium which, with their substantial binding affinity and selectivity for EphA4, makes them excellent research tools to modulate EphA4 function.""","""['Ilaria Lamberto', 'Haina Qin', 'Roberta Noberini', 'Lakshmanane Premkumar', 'Caroline Bourgin', 'Stefan J Riedl', 'Jianxing Song', 'Elena B Pasquale']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Biochem J""","""['Development and structural analysis of a nanomolar cyclic peptide antagonist for the EphA4 receptor.', 'Crystal structure and NMR binding reveal that two small molecule antagonists target the high affinity ephrin-binding channel of the EphA4 receptor.', 'Structural characterization of the EphA4-Ephrin-B2 complex reveals new features enabling Eph-ephrin binding promiscuity.', 'Are we using the right pharmacological tools to target EphA4?', 'Targeting the Eph System with Peptides and Peptide Conjugates.', ""An Insight into Cellular and Molecular Mechanisms Underlying the Pathogenesis of Neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's Disease."", 'Structural insights into EphA4 unconventional activation from prediction of the EphA4 and its complex with ribonuclease 1.', 'NMR-Guided Design of Potent and Selective EphA4 Agonistic Ligands.', 'Human ribonuclease 1 serves as a secretory ligand of ephrin A4 receptor and induces breast tumor initiation.', 'Increased Expression of Ephrins on Immune Cells of Patients with Relapsing Remitting Multiple Sclerosis Affects Oligodendrocyte Differentiation.']"""

Thus, this work is to evaluate the effect of different b-values on IVIM perfusion fractions (f) and diffusion coefficients (D) for prostate cancer detection.

We assumed a clinically significant screening benefit, applied population treatments and survival patterns, and calculated mortality rate ratios relative to the contaminated and uncontaminated control arms.  Results:   The virtual trial reproduced observed incidence, including stage and grade distributions, and control arm mortality after 10 years of complete follow-up. Under the assumed screening benefit, the three models found that contamination increased the mortality rate ratio from 0.68-0.77 to 0.86-0.91, increased the chance of excess mortality in the intervention arm from 0-4 % to 15-28 %, and decreased the power of the trial to detect a mortality difference from 40-70 % to 9-25 %.  Conclusions:   Our computer simulation models indicate that contamination substantially limited the ability of the PLCO to identify a clinically significant screening benefit. While the trial shows annual screening does not reduce mortality relative to population screening, contamination prevents concluding whether screening reduces mortality relative to no screening.""","""['Roman Gulati', 'Alex Tsodikov', 'Elisabeth M Wever', 'Angela B Mariotto', 'Eveline A M Heijnsdijk', 'Jeffrey Katcher', 'Harry J de Koning', 'Ruth Etzioni']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Cancer Causes Control""","""['Assessing contamination and compliance in the prostate component of the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial.', 'Prostate cancer screening in the randomized Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial: mortality results after 13 years of follow-up.', 'Lung cancer screening in the randomized Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial.', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen-Based Screening for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Evidence Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA)-Based Population Screening for Prostate Cancer: An Evidence-Based Analysis.', 'The Patient Journey from Randomization to Detection of Prostate Cancer and Death: Results from ERSPC Rotterdam.', 'How Did CNBSS Influence Guidelines for So Long and What Can That Teach Us?', 'Assessment of factors associated with PSA level in prostate cancer cases and controls from three geographical regions.', 'Differences in Prostate Cancer Incidence and Mortality in Lower Saxony (Germany) and Groningen Province (Netherlands): Potential Impact of Prostate-Specific Antigen Testing.', 'When to Discuss Prostate Cancer Screening With Average-Risk Men.']"""

However, the molecular determinants of anoikis resistance and sensitivity are poorly understood. To better understand resistance to anoikis we conducted a genome wide lentiviral shRNA screen to identify genes whose knockdown render anoikis-sensitive RWPE-1 prostate cells resistant to anoikis. RWPE-1 cells were infected with a pooled lentiviral shRNA library with 54,021 shRNA targeting 11,255 genes. After infection, an anoikis-resistant cell population was selected and shRNA sequences were amplified and sequenced. Thirty-four shRNA sequences reproducibly protected RWPE-1 cells from anoikis after culture under suspension conditions including the top validated hit, α/β hydrolase domain containing 4 (ABHD4). In validation studies, ABHD4 knockdown inhibited anoikis in RWPE-1 cells as well as anoikis sensitive NP69 nasopharyngeal and OVCAR3 ovarian cancer cells, while over-expression of the gene increased sensitivity. Induction of anoikis after ABHD4 knockdown was associated with cleavage of PARP and activation of caspases-3, but was independent in changes of FLIP, FAK and Src expression. Interestingly, induction of anoikis after ABHD4 knockdown was independent of the known role of ABHD4 in the anandamide synthesis pathway and the generation of glycerophospho-N-acyl ethanolamines. Thus, ABHD4 is a novel genetic regulator of anoikis sensitivity.""","""['Craig D Simpson', 'Rose Hurren', 'Dahlia Kasimer', 'Neil MacLean', 'Yanina Eberhard', 'Troy Ketela', 'Jason Moffat', 'Aaron D Schimmer']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Apoptosis""","""['ABHD4-dependent developmental anoikis safeguards the embryonic brain.', 'Suppression of ABHD2, identified through a functional genomics screen, causes anoikis resistance, chemoresistance and poor prognosis in ovarian cancer.', 'A chemical screen identifies anisomycin as an anoikis sensitizer that functions by decreasing FLIP protein synthesis.', 'Critical role for Fas-associated death domain-like interleukin-1-converting enzyme-like inhibitory protein in anoikis resistance and distant tumor formation.', 'Anoikis resistance and tumor metastasis.', 'α/β-Hydrolase Domain (ABHD) Inhibitors as New Potential Therapeutic Options against Lipid-Related Diseases.', 'ABHD4-Regulating RNA Panel: Novel Biomarkers in Acute Coronary Syndrome Diagnosis.', 'TSHZ2 is an EGF-regulated tumor suppressor that binds to the cytokinesis regulator PRC1 and inhibits metastasis.', 'ABHD4-dependent developmental anoikis safeguards the embryonic brain.', 'Gene Expression Signature of BRAF Inhibitor Resistant Melanoma Spheroids.']"""

Methods:   High-resolution two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2D-PAGE) was used to identify tumor-associated NM proteins in the PCa specimens obtained from 94 patients. The association between the expression of each protein and the probability of PSA progression or death was studied through univariate analysis. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis was then used to generate patient clusters showing comparable outcomes by including the proteins that were predictive at univariate analysis. PSA-free and overall survival curves relative to each cluster were constructed by means of the Kaplan-Meier method and curves compared by the log-rank test. Multi-parametric models were constructed according to Cox proportional hazard technique.  Results:   After a median follow-up of 11.7 years (range, 6.5-16.2), 50 patients progressed and 22 died. Of the eight NM proteins identified through 2D-PAGE, proteins NM-6, NM-7 and NM-8 were confirmed to be individually associated with a higher risk of PSA progression at univariate analysis. Proteins NM-6 and NM-8 were also predictive of survival probability. Hierarchical clustering analysis of these proteins allowed to identify one cluster of tumors co-expressing the three proteins or proteins NM-6 and NM-8, characterized by a very poor outcome, suggesting a specific role for these proteins in PCa progression.

We retrospectively compared two group of patients, who underwent surgery for GIST before and after Imatinib advent in order to analyze the recurrence and survival rate.  Methods:   Two patient groups who underwent surgery for GIST, from January 1997 to December 2002 (Pre-Imatinib group) and from January 2003 to December 2008 (Post-Imatinib group) were compared. Patients were evaluated on the base of gender, age, clinical manifestations, primary location and metastasis positivity, tumor size, mitotic index, immunoreactivity for CD117 and the outcome, including date of death.  Results:   In the Pre-IM group only one patient died for prostate cancer, 12 months after operation, the other died because of GIST with a 24.6 months of median survival rate (range 15-51). In the remaining 12 patients the median follow up period was 55 months (range 6-152 months). In the Post-IM group the mean follow up was 50.7 months (range 26-74) and they are still being assessed for oncological as well as surgical treatment.  Conclusion:   Early diagnosis and radical resection remain the standard of cure for GISTs. To date, the use of Imatinib lead to its utilization as adjuvant and neo-adjuvant therapy in adults.

For this analysis, the data repository was reviewed for information on patients with localized prostate cancer (T1 -- T2) treated with complete (whole-gland) HIFU on the basis of an anterior-posterior prostate height of ≤24 mm and a treated volume >120% of the prostate volume. Patients were regularly followed with PSA measurement and biopsy. Biochemical failure was defined for this study as PSA nadir +2 ngml(-1) (Phoenix definition). Disease-free survival was based on a biopsy, retreatment and biochemical data. Patients were risk group-stratified using the D'Amico classification system.  Results:   The median follow-up was 2.8 years for the 356 patients included in the analysis. The majority could be classified as either low (44.9%) or intermediate risk (39.6%); 14.6% patients were classified as high risk. The median (mean, s.d.)

The expression of B7-H3 and the proliferation marker Ki-67, as well as other standard clinicopathological parameters, were evaluated.  Results:   A high expression of B7-H3 was associated with pathological stage T3a and T3b, high Gleason score, extraprostatic extension, seminal vesicle invasion and high proliferative activity.

AND WHAT DOES THE STUDY ADD?: To date, only a few studies have addressed the long-term oncological outcomes of radical prostatectomy (RP) in patients with pathological Gleason score ≥ 8 prostate cancer. According to these reports, some individuals with pathological Gleason score ≥ 8 may benefit from RP, with cancer-control outcomes comparable with those of patients with low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancer. The presence of pathological Gleason score 8-10 represents a poor prognostic factor in the outcome of men with prostate cancer. However, in patients with specimen-confined disease, RP and bilateral PLND provided long-term cancer-control outcomes similar to those of patients with more favourable disease characteristics.  Objectives:   To evaluate the outcomes of patients with pathological Gleason score 8-10 prostate cancer subjected to radical prostatectomy (RP). To determine the prognostic factors associated with cancer-specific survival (CSS) in this subset of patients.  Patients and methods:   The study included 580 consecutive patients with pathological Gleason sum 8-10 prostate cancer treated with RP and pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND) at a single European institution between July 1988 and April 2010. All patients had detailed pathological and follow-up data. Pathological Gleason score was determined by a single expert genitourinary pathologist. Biochemical recurrence (BCR) was defined PSA concentration of ≥ 0.2 ng/mL and rising. Kaplan-Meier plots were used to graphically explore BCR-free survival as well as CSS and overall survival (OS) rates. Moreover, univariable and multivariable Cox regression models were fitted to test the predictors of CSS.  Results:   The mean (median, range) age at surgery was 66.1 (66.4, 41-85) years. The mean (median, range) total PSA concentration was 29.6 (11.1, 0.5-1710) ng/mL. Pathological Gleason score was 8 in 238 (41.0%), 9 in 330 (56.9%) and 10 in 12 (2.1%) patients. Overall, 119 (20.5%), 124 (21.4%), 281 (48.4%) and 56 (9.7%) patients had pT2, pT3a, pT3b and pT4 prostate cancer, respectively. Overall, 275 (47.4%) had LN invasion, while 150 (25.1%) patients had specimen-confined disease (defined as pT2cR0 pN0 or pT3aR0 pN0 prostate cancer). The mean (median, range) follow-up was 53 (47, 1-226) months. At 5 and 10 years after RP, BCR-free survival was 76.7% and 49.6%, respectively. Similarly, the 5- and 10-year CSS rates were 87.3% and 69.5%, respectively. Patients with specimen-confined disease (P < 0.001) and patients with negative LNs (P = 0.012) had significantly better CSS rates than their counterparts with less favourable pathological characteristics. In multivariable Cox regression models, only the presence of specimen-confined disease achieved independent predictor status (P = 0.001).

Their quality of life, however, can deteriorate because of the incidence of bladder neck contracture (BNC). Our aim was to evaluate the incidence and the risk factors of BNC after minimally invasive radical prostatectomy (MIRP) with a single-knot running suture also known as the Van Velthoven technique (VVT).  Patients and methods:   From 2003 to 2010, 2115 patients underwent extraperitoneal, transperitoneal, or robot-assisted RP for localized PCa. A single-knot running suture according to the VVT was performed for the vesicourethral anastomosis. Follow-up was scheduled and standardized for all patients and recorded into a prospective database. BNC was defined by a reduction of the lumen that does not allow the passage of an 18F fibroscope.  Results:   Mean follow-up of the patients was 43 (6-144) months. Of all, 1342, 241, and 532 had extraperitoneal, transperitoneal, and robot-assisted prostatectomy, respectively. BNC was diagnosed in 30 (1.4%) patients. Among them, 78% had the diagnosis within the first year of follow-up. Previous transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) and external beam radiotherapy were independent risk factors of BNC.  Conclusions:   BNC incidence after MIRP using the single-knot running suture for the vesicourethral anastomosis is low. Previous TURP and external beam radiotherapy are identified as risk factors.

Interestingly, several years ago it was reported by a Russian group that Ivermectin can suppress almost completely the growth of human melanoma and a few other cancer xenografts in mice at the much higher doses (3-5 mg/kg) without any adverse effect on mice. However, its anti-cancer mechanism still remained to be clarified at the molecular levels, that would determine the specific type of cancers susceptible to this drug. The first hint towards its anti-PAK1 potential was a recent finding that Ivermectin at its sublethal doses dramatically reduces the litter size (number of eggs laid) of the tiny nematode C. elegans. Interestingly, either a PAK1-deficiency (gene knock-out) or treatment with natural anti-PAK1 products such as CAPE (caffeic acid phenethyl ester) and ARC (artepillin C), the major anti-cancer ingredients in propolis, also causes the exactly same effect on this nematode, suggesting the possibility that the kinase PAK1 might be a new target of Ivermectin.

Evidence from several groups indicates that epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) may enhance AR activity in prostate cancer cell lines. This study was designed to investigate the protein expression of AR, EGFR, and HER2 and to determine whether the EGFR and HER2 genes are amplified in prostate cancer tissues.  Materials and methods:   The protein expression levels of AR, EGFR, and HER2 in a tissue microarray block of 66 prostate cancer samples were investigated by immunohistochemical analysis and chromogenic in situ hybridization was used to determine whether the EGFR and HER2 genes were amplified in these tissues.  Results:   The AR and EGFR proteins were expressed in 59.1% and 40.9% of prostate cancers, respectively, but their expression levels were not significantly associated with clinicopathologic factors. Of the cases in which tissues were negative for EGFR protein expression, 69.2% were positive for AR protein expression; however, AR protein expression was significantly reduced (44.4%) in tissues in which EGFR protein was expressed. HER2 expression was detected in only 1 case (1.5%). No amplification of the EGFR or HER2 genes was found in prostate cancer specimens.  Conclusion:   This study was limited by small number of subjects, but it can still be inferred that the expression levels of the AR and EGFR proteins are inversely correlated in prostate cancer patients.

Here, we report that β(2)AR regulates formation of focal adhesions, whose dynamic remodeling is critical for directed cell migration. β(2)ARs induce activation of RhoA, which is dependent on βArrestin2 but not G(s). βArrestin2 forms a complex with p115RhoGEF, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for RhoA that is well known to be activated by G(12/13)-coupled receptors. Our results show that βArrestin2 forms a complex with p115RhoGEF in the cytosol in resting cells. Upon β(2)AR activation, both βArrestin2 and p115RhoGEF translocate to the plasma membrane, with concomitant activation of RhoA and formation of focal adhesions and stress fibers. Activation of RhoA and focal adhesion remodeling may explain, at least in part, the role of β(2)ARs in cell migration.

Currently, clinical phase I trials are underway to examine whether patients with FGFR1-amplified L-SCC benefit from a targeted therapy approach using small-molecule inhibitors. Because most patients with lung cancer present with metastatic disease, we investigated whether lymph node metastases in L-SCC share the FGFR1 amplification status of their corresponding primary tumor.  Methods:   The study cohort consisted of 72 patients with L-SCC, 39 with regional lymph node metastases. Tissue microarrays were constructed from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue of the primary tumors and, where present, of the corresponding lymph node metastasis. A biotin-labeled target probe spanning the FGFR1 locus (8p11.22-23) was used to determine the FGFR1 amplification status by fluorescence in situ hybridization.  Results:   FGFR1 amplification was detected in 16% (12 of 72) of all primary L-SCCs.

Conclusions:   FGFR1 amplification is a common genetic event occurring at a frequency of 16% in L-SCCs. Moreover, lymph node metastases derived from FGFR1-amplified L-SCCs also exhibit FGFR1 amplification. Therefore, we suggest that the FGFR1 amplification is a clonal event in tumor progression.

However, due to sensitivity limitations related to in-source ionization yield, many potential biomarkers are not detected by standard mass spectrometers. Therefore, more efficient ion-source technologies are needed to improve MS applications in biomarker discovery.  Methods:   Among novel ion-source technologies, Surface-Activated Chemical Ionization (SACI), although endowed with high sensitivity linked to its ability to reduce chemical noise in mass spectra, has seen limited application in biomarker discovery to date, due to its selectivity for highly polar compounds. However, in combination with an Electrospray Ionization (ESI) source, SACI selectivity can be enlarged in the range of less polar compounds. To validate the new SACI-ESI approach in biomarker discovery, we applied it to a translational setting in oncology. We performed MS profiles of 101 human serum samples from a male population, aged 40 or older, coming to the clinic for prostate cancer evaluation based on multiple PSA exams, digital rectal examination and echography. The SACI-ESI MS spectra were analyzed and classified with an innovative bioinformatic approach based on the MS-search freeware developed in house.  Results:   Here we demonstrate that the SACI-ESI combination can produce MS spectra with greater sensitivity and lower noise than those obtained with the common ESI alone. We found that the SACI-ESI combination increased the number of detectable compounds and produced better quality of profiles in liquid chromatography (LC) coupled with MS (LC/MS) analysis of human serum samples, improving disease prediction potential.  Conclusions:   SACI-ESI can facilitate MS-based discovery of potential biomarkers in human serum.

A major limitation of active contours, however, is in their 1) inability to resolve boundaries of intersecting objects and to 2) handle occlusion. Multiple overlapping objects are typically segmented out as a single object. On the other hand, ASMs are limited by point correspondence issues since object landmarks need to be identified across multiple objects for initial object alignment. ASMs are also are constrained in that they can usually only segment a single object in an image. In this paper, we present a novel synergistic boundary and region-based active contour model that incorporates shape priors in a level set formulation with automated initialization based on watershed. We demonstrate an application of these synergistic active contour models using multiple level sets to segment nuclear and glandular structures on digitized histopathology images of breast and prostate biopsy specimens. Unlike previous related approaches, our model is able to resolve object overlap and separate occluded boundaries of multiple objects simultaneously. The energy functional of the active contour is comprised of three terms.

This study investigated the acute effects of the small-molecule HIF-pathway inhibitor NSC-134754.  Methods:   Human PC-3LN5 prostate cancer cells were treated with NSC-134754 for 24 h in hypoxia. Orthotopic prostate tumour-bearing mice were treated with a single dose of NSC-134754 for 6, 24 or 48 h. Treatment response was measured using magnetic resonance spectroscopy and imaging. Ex-vivo histological validation of imaging findings was also sought.  Results:   In vitro, NSC-134754 significantly reduced lactate production and glucose uptake (P<0.05), while significantly increasing intracellular glucose (P<0.01) and glutamine uptake/metabolism (P<0.05). Increased glutamine metabolism was independent of c-Myc, a factor also downregulated by NSC-134754. In vivo, a significantly higher tumour apparent diffusion coefficient was determined 24 h post-treatment (P<0.05), with significantly higher tumour necrosis after 48 h (P<0.05). NSC-134754-treated tumours revealed lower expression of HIF-1α and glucose transporter-1, at 6 and 24 h respectively, while a transient increase in tumour hypoxia was observed after 24 h. Vessel perfusion/flow and vascular endothelial growth factor levels were unchanged with treatment.  Conclusion:   NSC-134754 induces metabolic alterations in vitro and early anti-tumour activity in vivo, independent of changes in vascular function.

We studied time to progression, overall and prostate cancer specific survival, and time to treatment failure.  Materials and methods:   Between May 1997 and February 2003, 852 men with locally advanced or metastatic prostate cancer were enrolled to receive androgen deprivation therapy for 24 weeks. Patients in whom prostate specific antigen decreased to less than 10 ng/ml, or by 50% or more if less than 20 ng/ml at baseline, were randomized to intermittent or continuous androgen deprivation. In the intermittent therapy arm androgen deprivation therapy was withdrawn and resumed again for at least 24 weeks based mainly on prostate specific antigen decrease and increase.  Results:   There were 298 patients who did not meet the randomization criteria. The remaining 554 patients were randomized, with 274 (49.5%) to intermittent androgen deprivation and 280 (50.5%) to the continuous androgen deprivation arm. Median followup was 65.0 months. Of these patients 392 (71%) died, including 186 (68%) in the intermittent androgen deprivation arm and 206 (74%) in the continuous androgen deprivation arm (p=0.12). There were 248 prostate cancer deaths, comprised of 117 (43%) in the intermittent androgen deprivation and 131 (47%) in the continuous androgen deprivation arm (p=0.29). Median times from randomization to progression were 34.5 and 30.2 months in the intermittent androgen deprivation and continuous androgen deprivation arms, respectively. Median times to death (all cause) were 45.2 and 45.7 months, to prostate cancer death 45.2 and 44.3 months, and to treatment failure 29.9 and 30.5 months, respectively.

Materials and methods:   American urologists submit case logs for initial board certification and recertification. We analyzed logs from 2004 to 2010 for trends and used logistic regression to assess the impact of urologist age on robotic radical prostatectomy use.  Results:   A total of 4,709 urologists submitted case logs for certification between 2004 and 2010. Of these logs 3,374 included 1 or more radical prostatectomy cases. Of the urologists 2,413 (72%) reported performing open radical prostatectomy only while 961 (28%) reported 1 or more robotic radical prostatectomies and 308 (9%) reported robotic radical prostatectomy only. During this 7-year period we observed a large increase in the number of urologists who performed robotic radical prostatectomy and a smaller corresponding decrease in those who performed open radical prostatectomy. Only 8% of patients were treated with robotic radical prostatectomy by urologists who were certified in 2004 while 67% underwent that procedure in 2010. Median age of urologists who exclusively performed open radical prostatectomy was 43 years (IQR 38-51) vs 41 (IQR 35-46) for those who performed only robotic radical prostatectomy.  Conclusions:   While the rate was not as high as the greater than 85% industry estimate, 67% of radical prostatectomies were done robotically among urologists who underwent board certification or recertification in 2010.

Materials and methods:   This retrospective diagnostic accuracy study compares the results of primary transperineal biopsies with the radical prostatectomy pathology of 414 consecutive patients treated at a single institution between November 2002 and August 2010.  Results:   The average sensitivity and specificity for the detection of cancer in all prostates across all biopsy zones was 48% (95% CI 42.6-53.4) and 84.1% (95% CI 80-88.2), respectively. There was a statistically significant decrease in the sensitivity of transperineal biopsy in larger prostates (t11=4.687, p=0.001). The overall Kappa value was 0.255 (95% CI 0.212-0.298). Grading concordance between biopsy and pathology specimens was achieved in 65.7% of patients. Upgrading of Gleason scores occurred in 25.6% of patients and downgrading occurred in 8.8%.  Conclusions:   Our current transperineal biopsy method has only demonstrated fair agreement with the histopathology findings of the corresponding radical prostatectomy specimens. This finding is most likely due to the small, multifocal nature of prostate cancer in the patient series. The cancer detection rate was lower in larger prostates.

Results:   Complete pathological information was available for 427 patients, who had a median of 16 lymph nodes removed. Of the patients 35 (8.2%) had lymph node metastases, including 1.7% with low, 8.6% with intermediate and 23.9% with high risk cancer. Of those with nodal metastases 24 (69%) had positive lymph nodes in only 1 of the 3 areas, including the external iliac in 4 (11%), the obturator in 9 (26%) and the hypogastric in 11 (31%).

We determined age stratified 95th percentile prostate specific antigen reference ranges and the prostate cancer detection rate at specific prostate specific antigen intervals for patients with end stage renal disease.  Materials and methods:   We retrospectively reviewed the records of 775 male patients with end stage renal disease on the waiting list for a renal transplant who had undergone a serum prostate specific antigen test. Prostate specific antigen was stratified by age at the time of the blood test and 95th percentile reference ranges were calculated for each decade. A total of 80 patients underwent prostate biopsy for increased prostate specific antigen and/or abnormal digital rectal examination. The cancer detection rate was calculated for specific prostate specific antigen reference ranges.  Results:   The age specific 95th percentile prostate specific antigen references ranges were 0 to 4.0 ng/ml for ages 40 to 49 in 137 patients, 0 to 5.3 ng/ml for ages 50 to 59 in 257, 0 to 10.5 ng/ml for ages 60 to 69 in 265 and 0 to 16.6 ng/ml for ages 70 to 79 years in 69.

Number of biopsy sessions (range 1 to 8) was examined as a continuous and categorical (1, 2 and 3 to 8) variable.

The association between number of prior biopsy sessions and biochemical recurrence was analyzed using the Cox proportional hazards model. Kaplan-Meier estimates of freedom from biochemical recurrence were compared among the groups.  Results:   Of the 2,739 men in the SEARCH database who met the inclusion criteria 2,251 (82%) had only 1 biopsy, 365(13%) had 2 biopsies and 123 (5%) had 3 or more biopsies. More biopsy sessions were associated with higher prostate specific antigen (p<0.001), greater prostate weight (p<0.001), lower biopsy Gleason sum (p=0.01) and more organ confined (pT2) disease (p=0.017). The Cox proportional hazards model demonstrated no association between number of biopsy sessions as a continuous or categorical variable and biochemical recurrence. Kaplan-Meier estimates of freedom from biochemical recurrence were similar across biopsy groups (log rank p=0.211).

Increasing the number of cores enhances the cancer detection rate by sampling additional sites and obtaining more tissue. An alternative way to inspect more tissue would be to obtain longer cores.

We assessed the role of biopsy core length in prostate biopsy and determined the minimal tissue length to serve as quality assurance.  Materials and methods:   We retrospectively analyzed the records of 331 patients who underwent transrectal ultrasound guided initial prostate biopsy with 12 to 18 cores. The biopsy procedure and pathological evaluation were standardized. Core length was compared in patients with vs without cancer. Statistical analysis was done to determine a minimally acceptable cutoff for biopsy length.  Results:   We analyzed data on 245 patients. The overall cancer detection rate was 30.2%. Mean core length in patients with vs without cancer was 12.3±2.6 vs 11.4±2.4 mm (p=0.015). Thus, core length was significantly longer in patients with cancer. Core length greater than 11.9 mm was associated with an increased prostate cancer detection rate (OR 2.57, 95% 1.46-4.52). The cancer detection rate for cores less vs greater than 11.9 mm was 23% vs 39%.

Materials and methods:   The study included 204 men with cT1b-T2bN0M0 prostate adenocarcinoma and at least 1 unfavorable factor, including prostate specific antigen less than 10 to 40 ng/ml, Gleason 7 or greater, or T3 on magnetic resonance imaging. We performed Fine and Gray regression, and Cox multivariable analysis to determine whether an increasing prostate specific antigen nadir was associated with prostate cancer specific and all cause mortality, adjusting for treatment, age, Adult Comorbidity Evaluation 27 score and cancer prognostic factors.  Results:   At a 6.9-year median followup median prostate specific antigen nadir was 0.7 ng/ml for radiation alone and 0.1 ng/ml for radiation plus androgen deprivation therapy. The prostate specific antigen nadir (adjusted HR 1.18/ng/ml increase, 95% CI 1.07-1.31, p=0.001) and Gleason 8 or greater (adjusted HR 8.05, 95% CI 1.01-64.05, p=0.049) significantly predicted increased prostate cancer specific mortality. Moderate/severe comorbidity carried a decreased risk (adjusted HR 0.13, 95% CI 0.02-0.96, p=0.045). Higher prostate specific antigen nadir (adjusted HR 1.10/ng/ml increase, 95% CI 1.04-1.17), older age (adjusted HR 1.10/year, 95% CI 1.04-1.15) and interaction between comorbidity score and randomization arm (each p<0.001) increased the all cause mortality risk. Men who achieved a prostate specific antigen nadir of the median value or less had lower estimated prostate cancer specific and all cause mortality at 7 years (3.7% vs 18.3%, p=0.0005 and 31.5% vs 55.0%, p=0.002).

Materials and methods:   A total of 353 consecutive patients suspicious for prostate cancer were prospectively randomized for real-time elastography (178) or gray scale ultrasound (175). Each patient enrolled in the study underwent a 10-core prostate biopsy. Six lateral prostate sectors (base, mid, apex) were scanned for cancer suspicious areas, defined as stiffer blue lesions using real-time elastography and hypoechoic lesions using gray scale ultrasound. Suspicious areas were sampled by a single targeted biopsy and considered representative of a defined prostate sector. If real-time elastography or gray scale ultrasound did not visualize a suspicious area in a sector, the biopsy core was taken systematically. Imaging findings were correlated with histopathological reports. Real-time elastography and gray scale ultrasound cases were compared in terms of cancer detection rate and imaging guidance accuracy.  Results:   Characteristics of patients undergoing real-time elastography and gray scale ultrasound, including age, prostate specific antigen, prostate volume and digital rectal examination, were not significantly different (p>0.05). Prostate cancer was detected in 160 of 353 patients (45.3%). The prostate cancer detection rate was significantly higher in patients who underwent biopsy with the real-time elastography guided approach compared to the gray scale ultrasound guided biopsy at 51.1% (91 of 178) vs 39.4% (69 of 175) (p=0.027). Overall sensitivity and specificity to detect prostate cancer was 60.8% and 68.4% for real-time elastography vs 15% and 92.3% for gray scale ultrasound, respectively.

Exclusion bias may occur since D'Amico staging requires all 3 variables to be known and data may not be missing at random.  Materials and methods:   From the SEER database we identified 132,606 men with incident prostate cancer from 2004 to 2006. We documented age, race, Gleason score, clinical T stage, PSA and geographic region. Men were categorized into D'Amico risk groups. Those with 1 or more unknown tumor variables (prostate specific antigen, T stage and/or Gleason score) were labeled unclassified. We compared the value of the other 2 known clinical variables for men with known vs unknown prostate specific antigen, Gleason score and T stage. Demographics were compared for those with and without missing data. Results were compared using chi-square and logistic regression.  Results:   Of the men 33% had 1 or more unknown tumor variables with T stage the most commonly missing variable. There was no clinically significant difference in the value of the other 2 known tumor variables when T stage or prostate specific antigen was missing. Men older than 75 years were more likely to have unknown variables than younger men. There was significant geographic variation in the frequency of unclassified D'Amico data.  Conclusions:   In studies in which the data set is limited to men who can be classified into a D'Amico risk group 33% of eligible patients are excluded from analysis.

Methods:   Between December 2002 and November 2007, 101 consecutive patients with intermediate or high risk prostate cancer were treated with EBRT plus an HDR boost. The HDR boost was initially delivered in three fractions of 6.5 Gy each via one implant; this was subsequently modified to a two-fraction technique with separate implants 2 weeks apart (8.5 Gy each). Most patients also received at least 3 months of androgen ablation.  Results:   Our cohort included 65 intermediate risk and 36 high-risk patients.

While aberrant activation of beta-catenin signaling has been implicated in cancers, the biochemical identity of transcriptionally active beta-catenin (ABC), commonly known as unphosphorylated serine 37 (S37) and threonine 41 (T41) β-catenin, remains elusive. Our current study demonstrates that ABC transcriptional activity is influenced by phosphorylation of T120 by Protein Kinase D1 (PKD1). Whereas the nuclear β-catenin from PKD1-low prostate cancer cell line C4-2 is unphosphorylated S37/T41/T120 with high transcription activity, the nuclear β-catenin from PKD1-overexpressing C4-2 cells is highly phosphorylated at T120, S37 and T41 with low transcription activity, implying that accumulation of nuclear β-catenin alone cannot be simply used as a read-out for Wnt activation. In human normal prostate tissue, the phosphorylated T120 β-catenin is mainly localized to the trans-Golgi network (TGN, 22/30, 73%), and this pattern is significantly altered in prostate cancer (14/197, 7.1%), which is consistent with known down regulation of PKD1 in prostate cancer. These in vitro and in vivo data unveil a previously unrecognized post-translational modification of ABC through T120 phosphorylation by PKD1, which alters subcellular localization and transcriptional activity of β-catenin. Our results support the view that β-catenin signaling activity is regulated by spatial compartmentation and post-translational modifications and protein level of β-catenin alone is insufficient to count signaling activity.""","""['Cheng Du', 'Chuanyou Zhang', 'Zhuo Li', 'Md Helal Uddin Biswas', 'K C Balaji']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Beta-catenin phosphorylated at serine 45 is spatially uncoupled from beta-catenin phosphorylated in the GSK3 domain: implications for signaling.', 'Bryostatin 1 modulates beta-catenin subcellular localization and transcription activity through protein kinase D1 activation.', 'Issues associated with assessing nuclear localization of N-terminally unphosphorylated beta-catenin with monoclonal antibody 8E7.', 'Multifaceted interaction between the androgen and Wnt signaling pathways and the implication for prostate cancer.', 'Regulation of protein kinase D1 activity.', 'Golgi Complex: A Signaling Hub in Cancer.', 'Walking the tight wire between cell adhesion and WNT signalling: a balancing act for β-catenin.', 'β-Catenin: oncogenic role and therapeutic target in cervical cancer.', 'CXCL12 promotes atherosclerosis by downregulating ABCA1 expression via the CXCR4/GSK3β/β-cateninT120/TCF21 pathway.', 'Proteomic screen with the proto-oncogene beta-catenin identifies interaction with Golgi coatomer complex I.']"""

We show that the N-terminal region of PRK2 prevents the interaction with its upstream kinase, the 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1), which phosphorylates the activation loop of PRK2. We confirm that the N-terminal region directly inhibits the kinase activity of PRK2. However, in contrast to previous models, our data indicate that this inhibition is mediated in trans through an intermolecular PRK2-PRK2 interaction. Our results also suggest that amino acids 487-501, located in the linker region between the N-terminal domains and the catalytic domain, contribute to the PRK2-PRK2 dimer formation. This dimerization is further supported by other N-terminal domains. Additionally, we provide evidence that the region C-terminal to the catalytic domain intramolecularly activates PRK2.

It remains as a challenging problem mainly due to three issues: First, the image contrast between the prostate and its surrounding tissues is low in prostate CT images and no obvious boundaries can be observed. Second, the unpredictable prostate motion causes large position variations of the prostate in the treatment images scanned at different treatment days. Third, the uncertainty of the existence of bowel gas in treatment images significantly changes the image appearance even for images taken from the same patient. To address these issues, in this paper we are motivated to propose a feature based learning framework for accurate prostate localization in CT images. The main contributions of the proposed method lie in the following aspects: (1) Anatomical features are extracted from input images and adopted as signatures for each voxel. The most robust and informative features are identified by the feature selection process to help localize the prostate. (2) Regions with salient features but irrelevant to the localization of prostate, such as regions filled with bowel gas are automatically filtered out by the proposed method. (3) An online update mechanism is adopted in this paper to adaptively combine both population information and patient-specific information to localize the prostate. The proposed method is evaluated on a CT prostate dataset of 24 patients to localize the prostate, where each patient has more than 10 longitudinal images scanned at different treatment times. It is also compared with several state-of- the-art prostate localization algorithms in CT images, and the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves the highest localization accuracy among all the methods under comparison.""","""['Shu Liao', 'Dinggang Shen']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""IEEE Trans Image Process""","""['Sparse patch based prostate segmentation in CT images.', 'Sparse patch-based label propagation for accurate prostate localization in CT images.', 'Locally-constrained boundary regression for segmentation of prostate and rectum in the planning CT images.', 'Review of automatic pulmonary lobe segmentation methods from CT.', 'Segmentation and Image Analysis of Abnormal Lungs at CT: Current Approaches, Challenges, and Future Trends.', 'Automatic segmentation of the prostate on CT images using deep learning and multi-atlas fusion.', 'A combined learning algorithm for prostate segmentation on 3D CT images.', 'Combining Population and Patient-Specific Characteristics for Prostate Segmentation on 3D CT Images.', 'A Learning-Based CT Prostate Segmentation Method via Joint Transductive Feature Selection and Regression.', 'Subspace Regularized Sparse Multitask Learning for Multiclass Neurodegenerative Disease Identification.']"""

In our study, the cell killing and radiosensitizing effects of statin were analyzed in PC3 cell line. Activation of the autophagy pathway was analyzed using the GFP-LC3 assay and western blot to determine LC3-II expression. The radiosensitivity of PC3 cells was determined using the clonal survival assay, TUNEL assay, and the Annexin V apoptosis assay. The expression profiles of autophagy related genes were analyzed using a pathway specific real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) array. Autophagic response was induced in PC3 cells after exposure to statin and/or gamma rays. Inhibition of the autophagic process using small interfering RNAs (siRNA) targeting Atg7 and/or Atg12 significantly reduced radiosensitivity of PC3 cells. Statin also exhibited a significant apoptosis-inducing effect in PC3 cells, which can be partially suppressed by Atg7 siRNA. Cells treated with statin and gamma irradiation showed significantly reduced colony forming efficiency and increased number of Annexin V positive early apoptotic cells. Analysis of autophagy and its regulatory gene profile showed that the expressions of 22 genes out of 86 genes assessed were significantly altered in the cells exposed to combined treatment or statin alone. The data indicate that activation of the autophagy pathway may be responsible for apoptosis inducing effect of statin. Furthermore, combined treatment with radiation and autophagic inducer, such as statin, may be synergistic in inducing cell death of PC3 cells.""","""['Zhenhua He', 'Lingegowda S Mangala', 'Corey A Theriot', 'Larry H Rohde', 'Honglu Wu', 'Ye Zhang']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""J Radiat Res""","""['Statin-induced autophagy by inhibition of geranylgeranyl biosynthesis in prostate cancer PC3 cells.', 'Atorvastatin induces autophagy in prostate cancer PC3 cells through activation of LC3 transcription.', 'Inhibition of proliferation and induction of autophagy by atorvastatin in PC3 prostate cancer cells correlate with downregulation of Bcl2 and upregulation of miR-182 and p21.', 'Atorvastatin induces autophagic cell death in prostate cancer cells in\xa0vitro.', 'Targeting autophagy in prostate cancer: preclinical and clinical evidence for therapeutic response.', 'Modulation of radiosensitivity of DU145 prostate carcinoma cells by simvastatin.', 'Atorvastatin-mediated rescue of cancer-related cognitive changes in combined anticancer therapies.', 'Simultaneous impact of atorvastatin and mesenchymal stem cells for glioblastoma multiform suppression in rat glioblastoma multiform model.', 'CAV1 - GLUT3 signaling is important for cellular energy and can be targeted by Atorvastatin in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.', 'Statin use and longitudinal changes in prostate volume; results from the REduction by DUtasteride of prostate Cancer Events (REDUCE) trial.']"""

The objective was to investigate the gene expression changes underlying these metabolic aberrations to find regulatory genes with potential for targeted therapies.  Experimental design:   Fresh frozen samples (n = 133) from 41 patients undergoing radical prostatectomy were included. Histopathologic evaluation was carried out for each sample before a metabolic profile was obtained with high-resolution magic angle spinning (HR-MAS) spectroscopy. Following the HR-MAS, RNA was extracted from the same sample and quality controlled before carrying out microarray gene expression profiling. A partial least square statistical model was used to integrate the data sets to identify genes whose expression show significant covariance with citrate and ChoCC levels.  Results:   Samples were classified as benign, n = 35; cancer of low grade (Gleason score 6), n = 24; intermediate grade (Gleason score 7), n = 41; or high grade (Gleason score ≥ 8), n = 33.

Gene products predicting significantly a reduced citrate level were acetyl citrate lyase (ACLY, P = 0.003) and m-aconitase (ACON, P < 0.001). The two genes whose expression most closely accompanied the increase in ChoCC were those of phospholipase A2 group VII (PLA2G7, P < 0.001) and choline kinase α (CHKA, P = 0.002).

All cases were performed or supervised by the primary surgeon. Patient details, operative details, complications, early oncological and functional outcomes were analysed.  Results:   The median age was 65 (45-76) years and median preoperative prostate-specific antigen was 7.5 (2.5-23) ng/mL, with palpable disease present in 48%.

Recently it was shown that ADAM17 is highly expressed on the surface of many cancer cells, whereas normal cells express low levels of ADAM17, implying that ADAM17 is a potential immunotherapeutic target. We have generated a monoclonal antibody against human ADAM17, which recognized the membrane proximal cysteine-rich extension of the ADAM17 protein. Unlike normal cells, tumour cell lines, such as a prostate cancer cell line, pancreatic cancer cell lines, a breast cancer cell line and a non-small lung cancer cell line, expressed ADAM17 on the cell surface. Using the sequence of the antibody we generated an ADAM17-specific scFv (single-chain variable fragment) and fused this to a CD3-specific scFv to generate a bispecific T-cell engager antibody [A300E-BiTE (bispecific T-cell engager antibody)]. Specificity was demonstrated on cells in which ADAM17 was knocked down with a specific shRNA (short hairpin RNA). A300E-BiTE recognized ADAM17 and CD3 on the cell surface of tumour cells and T-cells respectively. In the presence of primary human peripheral blood mononuclear cells or human T-cells the addition of A300E-BiTE led to ADAM17-specific killing of prostate tumour cells indicating a novel strategy for the treatment of cancer.""","""['Kosuke Yamamoto', 'Ahmad Trad', 'Anja Baumgart', 'Linda Hüske', 'Inken Lorenzen', 'Athena Chalaris', 'Joachim Grötzinger', 'Tobias Dechow', 'Jürgen Scheller', 'Stefan Rose-John']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Biochem J""","""['A tetravalent bispecific TandAb (CD19/CD3), AFM11, efficiently recruits T cells for the potent lysis of CD19(+) tumor cells.', 'A bispecific diabody directed against prostate-specific membrane antigen and CD3 induces T-cell mediated lysis of prostate cancer cells.', 'A bispecific T cell engager targeting Glypican-1 redirects T cell cytolytic activity to kill prostate cancer cells.', 'Bispecific antibodies and trispecific immunocytokines for targeting the immune system against cancer: preparing for the future.', 'Design and Production of Bispecific Antibodies.', 'Progression in immunotherapy for advanced prostate cancer.', 'Metastatic Prostate Cancer-A Review of Current Treatment Options and Promising New Approaches.', 'Immunomodulatory role of metalloproteinase ADAM17 in tumor development.', 'Recent advances in therapeutic strategies for triple-negative breast cancer.', 'Immunotherapy in Advanced Prostate Cancer-Light at the End of the Tunnel?']"""

One of the major proteins of caveolae is caveolin 1 (Cav-1). Cellular levels of Cav-1 are associated with cancer progression. In prostate cancer cells, levels of Cav-1 are positively correlated with tumor progression and metastasis. Cav-1 can be secreted by prostate cancer cells into the microenvironment and triggers proliferation and anti-apoptosis of the tumor and tumor endothelial cells. Clinical studies have shown increased serum Cav-1 levels in patients with poor prognosis. In tissue culture and animal model experiments, blocking secreted Cav-1 by polyclonal antibodies inhibits tumor cell growth. Cav-1 is therefore a potential therapeutic target for prostate cancer treatment. In this study, we used Cav-1 knock-out mice as hosts to produce monoclonal anti-Cav-1 antibodies. A total of 11 hybridoma cell lines were selected for their ability to produce antibodies that bound GST-Cav-1 but not GST on glutathione-coated ELISA plates. Further screening with ELISAs using GST-Cav-1 fragments on GSH-coated plates classified these antibodies into four groups: N1-31 with five antibodies binds the far N-terminus between amino acids 1 and 31; N32-80 with three antibodies binds between amino acids 32 and 80; CSD with two antibodies potentially bind the scaffolding domain (amino acids 80-101); and Cav-1-C with 1 antibody binds parts of the C-terminal half. Binding affinities (Kd) of these antibodies to soluble Cav-1 ranged from 10(-11) to 10(-8) M. Binding competition experiments revealed that these antibodies recognized a total of six different epitopes on Cav-1. Potency of these antibodies to neutralize Cav-1-mediated signaling pathways in cultured cells and in animal models will be tested. A selected monoclonal antibody will then be humanized and be further developed into a potential anti-prostate cancer therapeutic.""","""['Shu-Ru Kuo', 'Salahaldin A Tahir', 'Sanghee Park', 'Timothy C Thompson', 'Scott Coffield', 'Arthur E Frankel', 'Jen-Sing Liu']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Hybridoma (Larchmt)""","""['Caveolin-1 regulates VEGF-stimulated angiogenic activities in prostate cancer and endothelial cells.', 'Stromal antiapoptotic paracrine loop in perineural invasion of prostatic carcinoma.', 'Functional analysis of secreted caveolin-1 in mouse models of prostate cancer progression.', 'The role of caveolin-1 in prostate cancer: clinical implications.', 'Caveolin-1: a novel biomarker for prostate cancer.', 'Caveolins as Regulators of Stress Adaptation.', 'Endothelial Caveolin-1 regulates the radiation response of epithelial prostate tumors.', 'Caveolin-1 is a risk factor for postsurgery metastasis in preclinical melanoma models.', '1,25 Dihydroxyvitamin D3 uptake is localized at caveolae and requires caveolar function.', 'Caveola-forming proteins caveolin-1 and PTRF in prostate cancer.']"""

The woodchuck post-transcriptional element (WPRE) was also introduced at the downstream of the E1A coding sequence, resulting in much higher expression of the E1A gene. DD3 is one of the most prostate cancer-specific genes and has been used as a clinical bio-diagnostic marker. PTEN is frequently inactivated in primary prostate cancers, which is crucial for prostate cancer progression. Therefore, the Ad.DD3.D55-PTEN has prostate cancer specific and potent antitumor effect. The tumor growth rate was almost completely inhibited with the final tumor volume after Ad.DD3.D55-PTEN treatment less than the initial volume at the beginning of Ad.DD3.D55-PTEN treatment, which shows the powerful antitumor effect of Ad.DD3.D55-PTEN on prostate cancer tumor growth. The CTGVT-PCa construct reported here killed all of the prostate cancer cell lines tested, such as DU145, 22RV1 and CL1, but had a reduced or no killing effect on all the non-prostate cancer cell lines tested.

However, the function and mechanisms of AR signaling in prostate cancer (PCa) stroma remain elusive. Here we report, by using proteomics pathway array analysis (PPAA), that androgen and its receptor inhibit the proliferation of prostate stromal cells through transcriptional suppression of cyclin B1, and we confirmed our findings at mRNA and protein levels using AR-negative or -positive primary prostate stromal cells. Furthermore, AR showed a negative correlation with cyclin B1 expression in stroma of human PCa samples in vivo. Mechanistically, we identify cyclin B1 as a bona fide AR target gene in prostate stromal cells. The negative regulation of cyclin B1 by AR is mediated through switching between E2F1 and E2F4 on the promoter of cyclin B1. E2F1 binds to the cyclin B1 promoter and maintains its expression and subsequent cell cycle progression in AR-negative stromal cells or AR-positive stromal cells when androgens are depleted. Upon stimulation with androgen in AR-positive stromal cells, E2F1 is displaced from the binding site by AR and replaced with E2F4, leading to the recruitment of the silencing mediator for retinoid and thyroid hormone receptor (SMRT)/histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) corepressor complex and repression of cyclin B1 at the chromatin level. The switch between E2F1 and E2F4 at the E2F binding site of the cyclin B1 promoter coincides with an androgen-dependent interaction between AR and E2F1 as well as the cytoplasmic-to-nuclear translocation of E2F4. Thus, we identified a novel mechanism for E2F factors in the regulation of cell cycle gene expression and cell cycle progression under the control of AR signaling.""","""['Yirong Li', 'David Y Zhang', 'Qinghu Ren', 'Fei Ye', 'Xin Zhao', 'Garrett Daniels', 'Xinyu Wu', 'Brian Dynlacht', 'Peng Lee']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Mol Cell Biol""","""['Formation of AR-SMRT binding in prostate cancer cells treated with natural histone deacetylase inhibitor.', 'Androgen Receptor-Mediated Growth Suppression of HPr-1AR and PC3-Lenti-AR Prostate Epithelial Cells.', 'Androgen regulates Cdc6 transcription through interactions between androgen receptor and E2F transcription factor in prostate cancer cells.', 'Influence of stromal-epithelial interactions on androgen action.', 'Stromal androgen receptor in prostate development and cancer.', 'Potential Therapeutic Targets for Luminal Androgen Receptor Breast Cancer: What We Know so Far.', 'Deep Learning-Based Multi-Omics Integration Robustly Predicts Relapse in Prostate Cancer.', 'Comprehensive analysis of the functional and prognostic value of E2F transcription factors in human prostate cancer through data mining and experimental validation.', 'The androgen receptor inhibits transcription of GPER1 by preventing Sp1 and Sp3 from binding to the promoters in prostate cancer cells.', 'Hsa-mir-3163 and CCNB1 may be potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for androgen receptor positive triple-negative breast cancer.']"""

At initial assessment and 4 to 5 weeks later, patients completed a 25-item measure of pain, functional interference, and other symptoms. Providers recorded analgesic prescribing. The pain management index was calculated to assess treatment adequacy.  Results:   Of the 3,023 patients we identified to be at risk for pain, 2,026 (67%) reported having pain or requiring analgesics at initial assessment; of these 2,026 patients, 670 (33%) were receiving inadequate analgesic prescribing.

Patients and methods:   From a collaborative data set of men with clinically localized prostate cancer treated with RT from four institutions in three countries, we identified 1,722 men with biochemical failure (BF; prostate-specific antigen nadir + 2 ng/mL). The IBF was defined as the time interval from completion of treatment to the date of BF. The primary outcome measure was discriminatory power in the form of the concordance index (c-index).  Results:   Seventeen percent of men had an IBF ≤ 18 months. Median potential follow-up beyond the time of BF was 67 months. There were 290 deaths from prostate cancer. The IBF was the most discriminating individual prognostic factor overall, with a sensitivity of IBF ≤ 18 months to predict PCM within 10 years of 48.4% (95% CI, 43.3% to 54.1%); the specificity was 86.1% (95% CI, 84.5% to 87.7%), equating to a c-index of 0.611 (95% CI, 0.578 to 0.647).

Chromatin accessibility, histone modifications, and nucleosome occupancy have all been found to play a role in defining these binding locations. Here, we show that hormone-induced DNase I hypersensitivity changes (ΔDHS) are highly predictive of androgen receptor (AR) and estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) binding in prostate cancer and breast cancer cells, respectively. While chromatin structure prior to receptor binding and nucleosome occupancy after binding are strikingly different for ESR1 and AR, ΔDHS is highly predictive for both.

In contrast, while global ESR1 binding is unrelated to changes in nucleosome occupancy, DNase I hypersensitivity dynamics are also predictive of the ESR1 cistrome.

Objectives:   The objective of the study was to determine whether vitamin D(3) supplementation at 4000 IU/d for 1 yr is safe and would result in a decrease in serum levels of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) or in the rate of progression.  Design:   In this open-label clinical trial (Investigational New Drug 77,839), subjects were followed up until repeat biopsy.  Setting:   All subjects were enrolled through the Medical University of South Carolina and the Ralph H. Johnson Veterans Affairs Medical Center, both in Charleston, SC.  Patients and other participants:   All subjects had a diagnosis of low-risk prostate cancer. Fifty-two subjects were enrolled in the study, 48 completed 1 yr of supplementation, and 44 could be analyzed for both safety and efficacy objectives.  Intervention:   The intervention included vitamin D(3) soft gels (4000 IU).  Main outcome measures:   Adverse events were monitored throughout the study. PSA serum levels were measured at entry and every 2 months for 1 yr. Biopsy procedures were performed before enrollment (for eligibility) and after 1 yr of supplementation.  Results:   No adverse events associated with vitamin D(3) supplementation were observed. No significant changes in PSA levels were observed. However, 24 of 44 subjects (55%) showed a decrease in the number of positive cores or decrease in Gleason score; five subjects (11%) showed no change; 15 subjects (34%) showed an increase in the number of positive cores or Gleason score.

Inhibition of androgen biosynthesis and/or AR antagonism should be efficacious in the treatment of CRPC. AKR1C3 catalyzes the formation of potent AR ligands from inactive precursors and is one of the most upregulated genes in CRPC. AKR1C3 inhibitors should not inhibit the related isoforms, AKR1C1 and AKR1C2 that are involved in 5α-dihydrotestosterone inactivation in the prostate. We have previously developed a series of flufenamic acid analogs as potent and selective AKR1C3 inhibitors [Adeniji, A. O. et al., J. Med. Chem.2012, 55, 2311]. Here we report the X-ray crystal structure of one lead compound 3-((4-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl) amino)benzoic acid (1) in complex with AKR1C3. Compound 1 adopts a similar binding orientation as flufenamic acid, however, its phenylamino ring projects deeper into a subpocket and confers selectivity over the other AKR1C isoforms. We exploited the observation that some flufenamic acid analogs also act as AR antagonists and synthesized a second generation inhibitor, 3-((4-nitronaphthalen-1-yl)amino)benzoic acid (2). Compound 2 retained nanomolar potency and selective inhibition of AKR1C3 but also acted as an AR antagonist. It inhibited 5α-dihydrotestosterone stimulated AR reporter gene activity with an IC(50)=4.7 μM and produced a concentration dependent reduction in androgen receptor levels in prostate cancer cells. The in vitro and cell-based effects of compound 2 make it a promising lead for development of dual acting agent for CRPC. To illuminate the structural basis of AKR1C3 inhibition, we also report the crystal structure of the AKR1C3·NADP(+)·2 complex, which shows that compound 2 forms a unique double-decker structure with AKR1C3.""","""['Mo Chen', 'Adegoke O Adeniji', 'Barry M Twenter', 'Jeffrey D Winkler', 'David W Christianson', 'Trevor M Penning']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Bioorg Med Chem Lett""","""['Development of potent and selective indomethacin analogues for the inhibition of AKR1C3 (Type 5 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/prostaglandin F synthase) in castrate-resistant prostate cancer.', 'A 3-(4-nitronaphthen-1-yl) amino-benzoate analog as a bifunctional AKR1C3 inhibitor and AR antagonist: Head to head comparison with other advanced AKR1C3 targeted therapeutics.', 'AKR1C3 as a target in castrate resistant prostate cancer.', 'Development of potent and selective inhibitors of aldo-keto reductase 1C3 (type 5 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase) based on N-phenyl-aminobenzoates and their structure-activity relationships.', 'New agents and strategies for the hormonal treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'X-ray structure of human aldo-keto reductase 1C3 in complex with a bile acid fused tetrazole inhibitor: experimental validation, molecular docking and structural analysis.', 'Novel inhibition of AKR1C3 and androgen receptor axis by PTUPB synergizes enzalutamide treatment in advanced prostate cancer.', 'Computational modeling studies reveal the origin of the binding preference of 3-(3,4-di hydroisoquinolin-2(1H)-ylsulfonyl)benzoic acids for AKR1C3 over its isoforms.', 'Intracrine androgen biosynthesis and drug resistance.', 'Analogues of Natural Chalcones as Efficient Inhibitors of AKR1C3.']"""

More recent approaches have modelled target displacement allowing for differences in random error between patients. However, until recently it has not been feasible to compare the goodness of fit of alternate models of random error rigorously. This is because the large volumes of real patient data necessary to distinguish between alternative models have only very recently become available. This work uses real-world displacement data collected from 365 patients undergoing radical radiotherapy for prostate cancer to compare five candidate models for target displacement. The simplest model assumes constant random errors across patients, while other models allow for random errors that vary according to one of several candidate distributions. Bayesian statistics and Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation of the model parameters are used to compare model goodness of fit. We conclude that modelling the random error as inverse gamma distributed provides a clearly superior fit over all alternatives considered.

Alpha-Methyl-CoA racemase (AMACR) mRNA was identified as being overexpressed in PCa. PTOV1 and racemase were immunohistochemically evaluated in PCa, high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN), atrophy and normal-looking epithelium (NEp) in 20 radical prostatectomies (RPs) with pT2a Gleason score 6 prostate cancer with the aim of analyzing the differences in marker expression between PTOV1 and AMACR. The level of expression of PTOV1 and AMACR increased from NEp and atrophy through HGPIN, away from and adjacent to prostate cancer, to PCa. With the ROC curve analysis the overall accuracy in distinguishing PCa vs HGPIN away from and adjacent to cancer was higher for AMACR than for PTOV1. In conclusion, AMACR can be considered a more accurate marker than PTOV1 in the identification of HGPIN and of PCa.

It is used to study dynamics of cytokinesis machinery in cells. However, the potential of this inhibitor as an anticancer agent has not been studied so far.  Methods:   Cytotoxicity of blebbistatin was evaluated in five human cell lines, FEMX-I melanoma, U87 glioma, androgen independent Du145 and androgen sensitive LNCaP prostate adenocarcinoma, and F11-hTERT immortalized fibroblasts. Phototoxicity of blebbistatin was assessed in these cell lines after their exposure to a blue light (390-470 nm). Photostability of blebbistatin and its reactive oxygen species (ROS) generating properties were measured during irradiation with the blue light.  Results:   Blebbistatin at a concentration range of 10-200 μmol/L was toxic to all studied cells. Toxic concentrations (TC) were about 10-25 μmol/L corresponding to TC10, 50-100 μmol/L to TC50 and 140-190 μmol/L to TC90. Only for the U87 glioma cells TC90 could not be measured as the highest studied concentration of 200 μmol/L gave around 70% toxicity. However, after exposure to the blue light blebbistatin exhibited phototoxicity on the cells, with a cytotoxicity enhancement ratio that was greatest for the FEMX-I cells (about 9) followed by LNCaP (5), Du145 (3), U87 (2) and F11-hTERT (1.7) cells.  Conclusions:   Blebbistatin inhibits cell motility and viability. Under exposure to the blue light blebbistatin exhibits photodynamic action on human cancer cells.

However, AR-mediated oncomiR pathways remain to be elucidated. We demonstrate that miR-27a is an androgen-regulated oncomir in prostate cancer, acting via targeting the tumour suppressor and AR corepressor, Prohibitin (PHB). Increasing miR-27a expression results in reduced PHB mRNA and protein levels, and increased expression of AR target genes and prostate cancer cell growth. This involves a novel mechanism for androgen-mediated miR regulation, whereby AR induces a transient increase in miR-23a27a24-2 transcription, but more significantly accelerates processing of the primiR-23a27a24-2 cluster. Androgens therefore regulate miR-27a expression both transcriptionally (via AR binding to the cluster promoter) and post-transcriptionally (accelerating primiR processing to the mature form).

Constitutive overexpression of the transcription factor Snai1 in the epithelial/TIC-enriched populations engaged a mesenchymal gene program and suppressed their self renewal and metastatic phenotypes. Conversely, knockdown of EMT factors in the mesenchymal-like prostate cancer cell subpopulation caused a gain in epithelial features and properties of TICs. Both tumor cell subpopulations cooperated so that the nonmetastatic mesenchymal-like prostate cancer subpopulation enhanced the in vitro invasiveness of the metastatic epithelial subpopulation and, in vivo, promoted the escape of the latter from primary implantation sites and accelerated their metastatic colonization.

We also examined the molecular mechanisms that promote apoptosis of LNCaP cells after infection with small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting HMGN5 (siRNA-HMGN5). The androgen-dependent LNCaP human prostate cancer cells were infected with siRNA-HMGN5. Apoptosis was detected using the Annexin V-PE/7-AAD double staining and the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) assays. Mitochondrial membrane potential was measured by JC-1 staining. HMGN5 and GAPDH mRNA expression were determined using real-time PCR. Bcl-2 and other apoptosis-related protein levels were determined by Western blot analysis. Caspase activity was measured by cleavage of the caspase substrate. Infection with siRNA targeting HMGN5 efficiently and specifically reduced the HMGN5 expression in LNCaP cells. The downregulation of HMGN5 induced remarkable apoptosis of LNCaP cells and resulted in the reduction of mitochondrial membrane potential. The induction of cell apoptosis was accompanied by the upregulation of Bax, the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and the activation of caspase3. The HMGN5-targeted siRNA was effective in downregulating the expression of HMGN5 in androgen-dependent prostate cancer cells and inducing cell apoptosis via the regulation of a caspase-related mitochondrial pathway and Bcl-2 family proteins.

Here we have examined how cyclic AMP elevation regulates early events in the neuroendocrine differentiation process. We demonstrate that selective activation of protein kinase A is necessary and sufficient for cyclic AMP (cAMP) elevation to rapidly promote a neuroendocrine phenotype in LNCaP cells independent of de novo protein synthesis. Furthermore, the effects of cAMP could be recapitulated by inhibition of RhoA signalling or pharmacological inhibition of Rho kinase. Conversely, expression of constitutively active Gln63Leu-mutated RhoA acted as a dominant-negative inhibitor of cAMP-mediated NE phenotype formation. Consistent with these observations, cAMP elevation triggered the PKA-dependent phosphorylation of RhoA on serine 188, and a non-phosphorylatable Ser188Ala RhoA mutant functioned as a dominant-negative inhibitor of cAMP-mediated neuroendocrine phenotype formation. These results suggest that PKA-mediated inhibition of RhoA via its phosphorylation on serine 188 and the subsequent inhibition of ROCK activity plays a key role in determining initial changes in cellular morphology during LNCaP cell differentiation to a neuroendocrine phenotype.

PET-CT images were interpreted by visual inspection and semi-quantitative analysis (standardized uptake value, SUV). Histopathological and formal clinical follow-up findings were used to assess the value of FDG PET-CT.  Results:   FDG PET-CT was able to detect the primary tumor in 54/120 patients (42.5%). The primary tumors were confirmed by histopathologic and formal clinical follow-up findings, and located in the head and neck (n=17), the lung (n=19), the breast (n=2), the esophagus (n=1), the stomach (n=2), the bile ducts (n=1), the pancreas (n=3), the co1on (n=3), the ovary (n=2), the prostate (n=l), others (n=3).

Methods and materials:   From April 1995 to June 2008, 2024 patients underwent brachytherapy by a single brachytherapist. Median follow-up was 7.4 years. The role of small prostate size (≤ 20 cm(3)) as a prognostic factor for biochemical progression-free survival, cause-specific survival, and all-cause mortality was investigated. The differences in survival between men with small and larger prostates were compared using Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank tests.  Results:   Median prostate size for the entire cohort was 32.7 cm(3). For the 167 men with small prostates, median prostate size was 17.4 cm(3). There was no difference in biochemical progression-free survival (95.2% vs 96.2%, P=.603), cause-specific survival (97.7% vs 98.3%, P=.546), or all-cause mortality (78.0% vs 77.2%, P=.838) at 10 years for men with small prostates compared with men with larger prostates. On univariate and multivariate analysis, small prostate size was not associated with any of the primary outcome measures.  Conclusion:   Men with small prostates treated with brachytherapy have excellent outcomes and are at no higher risk of treatment failure than men with larger glands. High-quality implants with adequate margins seem sufficient to address the increased adverse risk factors associated with small prostate size.""","""['Al V Taira', 'Gregory S Merrick', 'Robert W Galbreath', 'Wayne M Butler', 'Edward Adamovich', 'Kent E Wallner']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Distant metastases following permanent interstitial brachytherapy for patients with clinically localized prostate cancer.', 'Prognostic importance of tobacco use in men receiving definitive prostate brachytherapy.', 'Young men have equivalent biochemical outcomes compared with older men after treatment with brachytherapy for prostate cancer.', 'Clinically localised prostate cancer.', 'Updating in prevention and treatment of prostate cancer.', 'The Impact of Tobacco Use on Outcomes and Toxicity in a Predominantly Minority Population of Males with Prostate Cancer Receiving External Beam Radiation.', 'Comparing CTVs for permanent prostate brachytherapy.']"""

Materials and methods:   We conducted a phase II cohort study of 250 patients with prostate cancer undergoing intermittent maximal androgen deprivation therapy. Flutamide (Eulexin®) 250 mg 3 times daily and leuprolide (Lucrin®) 22.5 mg were given during a 9-month treatment phase (ONPhase). Therapy was ceased provided that prostate specific antigen was 4 ng/ml or less. Monitoring continued every 3 months for a further 2 years (OFFPhase) unless re-treatment occurred. Sexual function was assessed with the QLQ-PR25 version 3.0 prostate module in conjunction with the QLQ-C30 questionnaire at baseline and every 3 months thereafter.  Results:   At baseline 46% of patients reported sexual activity with almost half (43%) reporting mild or no erectile problems. Of the men 63% reported an interest in sex (libido), with 28% reporting moderate to high libido. In addition, 26% felt less masculine as a result of illness or treatment. By 3 months of ONPhase all parameters deteriorated, worsening to a low at 9 months. Only 13% of the men reported sexual activity and 10% reported moderate to high libido. The proportion of men feeling less masculine increased to 50%. During the OFFPhase recovery was observed. Of those previously sexually active men 52% resumed sexual activity. Of these patients all reported erectile function returning to baseline. Levels of libido, masculinity and sexual activity recovered but not to baseline levels.

The rapid development of sequencing technology has the potential to deliver new biomarkers with emphasis on aggressive disease and to revolutionise personalised cancer treatment. However, a prostate harbouring cancer commonly contains multiple separate tumour foci, with the potential to aggravate tumour sampling. The level of intraprostatic tumour heterogeneity remains to be determined.  Objective:   To determine the level of intraprostatic tumour heterogeneity through genome-wide, high-resolution profiling of multiple tumour samples from the same individual.  Design, settings, and participants:   Multiple tumour samples were obtained from four individuals following radical prostatectomy. One individual (SWE-1) contained >70% cancer cells in all tumour samples, whereas the other three (SWE-2 to SWE-4) required the use of laser capture microdissection for tumour cell enrichment. Subsequently, DNA was extracted from all tissue samples, and exome sequencing was performed. All tumour foci of SWE-1 were also profiled using a high-resolution array for the identification of copy number alterations (CNA).  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Shared somatic high-frequency single nucleotide variants (SNV) and CNAs were used to infer the level of intraprostatic tumour heterogeneity.  Results and limitations:   No high-frequency mutations, common for the three tumour samples of SWE-1, were identified. Ten randomly chosen positions were validated with Sanger sequencing in all foci, which verified the exome data. The high level of intraprostatic heterogeneity was consistent in all individuals. In total, three out of four individuals harboured tumours without an apparent common somatic denominator. Although we cannot exclude the presence of common structural rearrangements, a high-density array was used for the detection of deletions and amplifications in SWE-1, which agreed with the exome data.  Conclusions:   We present evidence for the presence of somatically independent tumours within the same prostate.

Design, setting, and participants:   A multicentre randomised open controlled phase 3 trial in 264 histologically confirmed T3-4 or pT3N0M0 prostate cancer patients randomised from March 2000 to December 2003.  Intervention:   ADT (11.25mg subcutaneous depot injection of leuprorelin every 3 mo for 3 yr) plus external-beam radiotherapy or ADT alone. Flutamide (750 g/d) was administered for 1 mo.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The primary objective was 5 yr progression-free survival (PFS) according to clinical or biologic criteria, using the American Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology (ASTRO) and the newer (Phoenix) definition (nadir plus 2 ng/ml), by intention to treat. Secondary objectives included time to locoregional recurrence and distant metastases, and overall and disease-specific survival. Our Analyses: intent-to-treat analysis, multivariate analyses using a Cox model with a 5% threshold from univariate analysis, and Kaplan-Meier estimates.  Results and limitations:   ADT alone was administered to 130 patients and combined therapy to 133.

What's known on the subject? and What does the study add? Intermittent androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) involves cycling ADT, allowing hormonal recovery during off-treatment periods. This could lead to a better quality of life during off-treatment periods and could delay progression to castration resistance. Safety and feasibility of intermittent ADT have been shown but tolerability and health-related quality of life improvement have been suggested but questioned by others. Results from randomized trials, including relapsing or mixed populations, have suggested intermittent ADT to be as effective as continuous ADT. In this study of only metastatic patients, no statistical difference in either overall survival or progression-free survival was shown between intermittent and continuous ADT and suggests that intermittent might be as safe as continuous castration. It could be an option in highly responding and well-informed metastatic patients even if no clear benefit in health-related quality of life was shown. This intermittent modality could be of interest in metastatic patients with significant treatment-induced side-effects.  Objective:   • To compare intermittent androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and continuous ADT after 6 months of induction of ADT in patients with metastatic prostate cancer (PCa).  Patients and methods:   • This is an open-label randomized multi-centre study conducted in 58 centres in Europe. • Patients with metastatic PCa and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level >20 ng/mL at selection were randomized after 6 months of induction of ADT (leuprorelin and flutamide) if PSA level had decreased below 4 ng/mL. • Patients received either continuous or intermittent ADT. All patients were treated until signs of disease progression under treatment or until study end with a monthly central PSA determination and follow-up visits were performed every 3 months. • The primary endpoint was overall survival. Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival, health-related quality of life (QLQ C30 questionnaire) and safety criteria.  Results:   • Of 383 selected patients, 173 had a PSA level below 4 ng/mL after 6 months of induction of ADT and were randomized. Median overall survival (52 vs 42 months, P= 0.75) and median progression-free survival (15.1 vs 20.7 months, P= 0.74) were not significantly different between continuous and intermittent ADT. • Although some differences in quality of life were observed, most of the functional and symptom scales showed no significant difference between the two groups. • Significantly fewer treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in the intermittent group (P= 0.042), with the incidence of headache and hot flushes also lower.

Optimal doses and schedules are not yet established. Debate still exists about whether prophylaxis with TAM is more effective than treatment of BEs when diagnosed. The results of a randomized study comparing TAM prophylaxis vs. TAM therapy are presented.  Methods:   One hundred seventy-six patients with prostate cancer (PC) who were candidates for bicalutamide monotherapy were randomized to receive TAM 20 mg daily orally within 1 month from the onset of BEs (arm A) vs. TAM 10 mg daily starting simultaneously with bicalutamide (arm B). TAM was administered for up to 1 year. BEs were evaluated by a self-administered visual analogue scale. Neither ultrasonography nor calipers were used to measure the degree of gynecomastia.  Results:   In arm A, BEs showed a prevalence, increasing with time up to 78.3%. After therapy with TAM they persisted in 27.7% of cases. Two patients (3%) interrupted TAM therapy because of dizziness, and 3 patients (4%) interrupted bicalutamide therapy because of painful gynecomastia. In arm B, the prevalence of BEs was 35% after 12 months of therapy. The difference in BEs between the 2 arms was statistically significant (P < .0001). The differences in prevalence of gynecomastia and breast pain between the 2 arms both favored TAM prophylaxis (P < .0001 and P < .001, respectively). Up to 35% of patients had BEs of low intensity, never requiring bicalutamide withdrawal. Two patients (3%) interrupted the treatment because of gastrointestinal intolerance. No difference emerged between the 2 arms in terms of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response, plasma testosterone levels, and tumor progression.  Conclusion:   Bicalutamide-induced BEs can be prevented to a significant degree by prophylaxis with TAM 10 mg/day or effectively treated with TAM therapy 20 mg/day.

What's known on the subject? and What does the study add? Patient-reported quality of life (QoL) in prostate cancer is recognized as an important outcome, and has been shown in multiple studies to capture the incidence and timing of patient symptoms more accurately than physician-graded toxicity reports. Although the long-term QoL after completing radiation therapy (RT) has been previously studied, patient experience during RT is not well described in the literature. The present study collected patient-reported QoL during RT in a prospective phase II clinical trial. The study describes in detail the time course and severity of gastrointestinal and genitourinary symptoms during radiation, providing clinically useful information for patients and physicians considering RT during the treatment decision-making process.  Objective:   • To evaluate data collected from a phase II trial to describe the time course and trajectory of patient-reported acute urinary and bowel symptom development during radiation therapy (RT) for prostate cancer.  Patients and methods:   • In all, 100 patients with intermediate- or high-risk prostate cancer received 72 Gy of RT to the prostate and seminal vesicles, with 6 months of concurrent androgen deprivation therapy; a rectal balloon was used for prostate immobilization. • Patients completed the validated Prostate Cancer Symptom Indices questionnaire every 1-2 weeks, reporting urinary and bowel symptoms on a four- or five-point Likert scale. • A score of ≥ 3 in a symptom is associated with clinically meaningful distress. Cumulative incidence of each symptom is reported. Bonferroni corrections of P values were used to adjust for multiple comparisons.  Results:   • Urinary symptoms were frequent at baseline and worsened during treatment. By the end of RT, 28-50% of patients developed clinically meaningful obstructive and irritative urinary symptoms. • Acute bowel symptoms were less frequent. Each bowel symptom increased in frequency by 9-26% from baseline to end of RT. • Urinary incontinence was rare. • Overall, symptom burden at the end of treatment was modest.  Conclusions:   • Urinary symptoms were common during RT, and bowel symptoms were less frequent. • These results inform patients and physicians during the decision-making process about potential patient quality of life experiences during RT, and also provide a benchmark for comparative effectiveness studies against newer treatments and technologies.""","""['Ronald C Chen', 'Yuanye Zhang', 'Ming-Hui Chen', 'Elizabeth McMahon', 'Marian Loffredo', 'Carol P McPherson', 'Angela U Nguyen', 'Paul L Nguyen', ""Anthony V D'Amico""]""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Functional outcomes and complications following radiation therapy for prostate cancer: a critical analysis of the literature.', 'Intensity-modulated radiotherapy causes fewer side effects than three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy when used in combination with brachytherapy for the treatment of prostate cancer.', 'Patient-reported quality of life during definitive and postprostatectomy image-guided radiation therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Single-fraction high-dose-rate brachytherapy and hypofractionated external beam radiotherapy for men with intermediate-risk prostate cancer: analysis of short- and medium-term toxicity and quality of life.', 'Quality of life after radiotherapy for prostate cancer.', 'Relationships between holmium laser enucleation of the prostate and prostate cancer.', 'Evaluation of the clinical impact of the differences between planned and delivered dose in prostate cancer radiotherapy based on CT-on-rails IGRT and patient-reported outcome scores.', 'Testing the efficacy of a couple-focused, tailored eHealth intervention for symptom self-management among men with prostate cancer and their partners: the study protocol.', 'Enhancing survivorship care planning for patients with localized prostate cancer using a couple-focused web-based, mHealth program: the results of a pilot feasibility study.', 'Quality of life worsened the most severely in patients immediately after intensity-modulated radiotherapy for prostate cancer.']"""

To assess potential genetic associations between the prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA) gene in the chromosome 8q24 locus and breast cancer risk in Korean women, 13 SNPs were selected and associations with breast cancer risk were analyzed with reference to hormone receptor (HR) and menopausal status.  Methods:   We analyzed DNA extracted from buffy coat from 456 patients and 461 control samples, using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) based upon region-specific PCR followed by allele- specific single base primer extension reactions. Risks associated with PSCA genotypes and haplotypes were estimated with chi-square test (χ2 -test), and polytomous logistic regression models using odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), by HR and menopausal status.  Results:   In case-control analysis, odds ratios (OR) of rs2294009, rs2294008, rs2978981, rs2920298, rs2976395, and rs2976396 were statistically significant only among women with estrogen receptor (ER) negative cancers, and those of rs2294008, rs2978981, rs2294010, rs2920298, rs2976394, rs10216533, and rs2976396 were statistically significant only in pre-menopausal women, and not in postmenopausal women. Risk with the TTGGCAA haplotype was significantly elevated in ER (-) status (OR= 1.48, 95% CI= 1.03~2.12, p<0.05). Especially risk of allele T of rs2294008 is significantly low in pre-menopausal breast cancer patients and AA genotype of rs2976395 in ER (-) status represents the increase of OR value.  Conclusion:   This report indicated for the first time that associations exist between PSCA SNPs and breast cancer susceptibility in Korean women, particularly those who are pre-menopausal with an estrogen receptor negative tumor status.""","""['Sook-Young Kim', 'Jae-Young Yoo', 'Aesun Shin', 'Yeonju Kim', 'Eun-Sook Lee', 'Yeon-Su Lee']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Asian Pac J Cancer Prev""","""['Single-nucleotide polymorphisms in PSCA and the risk of breast cancer in a Chinese population.', 'PSCA gene variants (rs2294008 and rs2978974) confer increased susceptibility of gallbladder carcinoma in females.', 'Common genetic variants in the PSCA gene influence gene expression and bladder cancer risk.', 'Prostate stem cell antigen polymorphisms and susceptibility to gastric cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Genetic factors related to gastric cancer susceptibility identified using a genome-wide association study.', 'The Correlation between PSCA Expression and Neuroendocrine Differentiation in Prostate Cancer.', 'Integrated landscape of copy number variation and RNA expression associated with nodal metastasis in invasive ductal breast carcinoma.', 'Association between PSCA gene polymorphisms and the risk of cancer: an updated meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis.', 'Single-nucleotide polymorphisms in PSCA and the risk of breast cancer in a Chinese population.', 'PSCA rs2294008 polymorphism contributes to the decreased risk for cervical cancer in a Chinese population.']"""

What's known on the subject? and What does the study add? Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is commonly used as a primary treatment for patients with prostate cancer (PCa) who are not eligible for radical treatment options. ADT is also used in patients with PCa as neo-adjuvant hormone therapy to reduce prostate volume and down-stage the disease before radiotherapy with curative intent. The present study showed that ADT with the gonadotropin hormone-releasing hormone (GhRH) antagonist degarelix is non-inferior to combined treatment with the LHRH agonist goserelin and bicalutamide in terms of reducing prostate volume during the treatment period of 3 months. Degarelix treatment evokes, however, significantly better relief of lower urinary tract symptoms in patients having moderate and severe voiding problems.  Objective:   • To assess the efficacy of monthly degarelix treatment for reduction of total prostate volume (TPV), relief of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and improvement of quality of life (QoL) in patients with prostate cancer (PCa) using monthly goserelin as active control.  Methods:   • This was a randomized, parallel-arm, active-controlled, open-label, multicentre trial on 182 patients treated with either monthly degarelix (240/80 mg) or goserelin (3.6 mg) for 12 weeks. • For flare protection, goserelin-treated patients also received daily bicalutamide (50 mg) during the initial 28 days. • Key trial variables monitored monthly were TPV (primary endpoint), serum testosterone, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and the Benign Prostate Hyperplasia Impact Index.  Results:   • In all, 175 patients completed the trial (96.1%). • At week 12, changes in TPV for degarelix and goserelin were similar (-37.2% vs -39.0%) and met the predefined non-inferiority criterion. • Decreases in IPSS were greater in degarelix than in goserelin-treated patients, differences being statistically significant in patients with baseline IPSS > 13 (-6.7 ± 1.8 vs -4.0 ± 1.0; P = 0.02). • The number of patients with an IPSS change of ≥ 3 over baseline was also significantly higher in patients treated with degarelix (61.0 vs 44.3%, P = 0.02). • Both treatments were safe and well tolerated.  Conclusions:   • Medical castration reduces TPV and could also improve LUTS in patients with PCa. • While the short-term efficacy of degarelix and goserelin + bicalutamide was the same in terms of TPV reduction, degarelix showed superiority in LUTS relief in symptomatic patients, which could highlight the different actions of these drugs on extrapituitary gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptors in the bladder and/or the prostate.""","""['Karol Axcrona', 'Sirpa Aaltomaa', 'Carlos Martins da Silva', 'Haluk Ozen', 'Jan-Erik Damber', 'László B Tankó', 'Enrico Colli', 'Peter Klarskov']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""[]"""

Therefore there has been considerable interest to explore neoadjuvant therapy. Polypeptide extracted from scorpion venom (PESV), originally obtained from the East-Asian scorpion Buthus martensi Karsch (BmK), is being studied for both prevention and treatment of various human malignancies including prostate cancer.  Methods:   The present study was to investigate the effect of PESV on cell proliferation, cell cycle, and apoptosis in human androgen-independent prostate cancer cells DU-145 in vitro.  Results:   PESV treatment on these cells resulted in a significantly dose-dependent growth inhibition with a G1 phase arrest at 40μg/mL after 48h treatment. PESV treatment strongly induced expression of p27 (Kip1), but resulted in a decrease in cyclin E, one of cyclins involved in G1 progression. In other studies, PESV treatment also induced high apoptosis index (AI), confirmed by TdTmediated dUTP-biotin nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay. Further, the apoptosis induction by PESV (40μg/mL) in DU145 cells was associated with an increase of pro-apoptotic protein Bax.  Conclusions:   These results suggest that PESV modulates the expression of cell cycle-related and apoptosis-related proteins and induces growth inhibition and apoptosis of DU145 cells, providing a strong rationale for future studies to evaluate prevention or/and intervention strategies for PESV in pre-clinical prostate cancer models.

When this happens the prognosis is usually poor. An early suspicion of recurrence may result in investigation leading to earlier and better treatment. A physical sign that may be an early and only sign of recurrence is described.  Objective:   To report the late Dr Ramon Evans' unpublished case series of the hot foot syndrome due to (mostly malignant) retroperitoneal disease. This unique contribution is an opportunity to pay tribute to a man who was a meticulous recorder of the patient narrative and practitioner of a detailed and comprehensive physical examination.  Methods:   A longitudinal, observational, retrospective, descriptive study is reported. Data were collected from a convenience sample of 86&nbsp;patients, 75 of whom had retroperitoneal cancer and 11 of whom were diagnosed with other conditions in that area. Patients referred to the Smythe Pain Clinic were seen at both the Princess Margaret Hospital and Toronto General Hospital in Toronto, Ontario, in the 1970s. They were referred with intractable pain in the leg or back and often a history of a treated abdominal or pelvic cancer in the previous months or years. Baseline demographic data were collected including age, sex, diagnosis, pain location, characteristics and severity, physical findings, investigations and mortality.  Results:   The 86 subjects comprised 27 men and 59 women. Carcinoma of the cervix was the most common tumour. Most had a presenting complaint of leg pain. Neurological physical signs were demonstrated in the lower extremities in 44%; however, 56% (48 patients) had only an ipsilateral, warm, dry 'hot foot' due to sympathetic deafferentation. The prognosis for the underlying illness was poor for the malignant group.  Discussion:   Sympathetic interruption by cancer is well known in apical lung cancer as the tumour spreads upwards to involve the inferior brachial plexus. An analogous situation occurs as cancers, such as that of the cervix, spread laterally to invade the lumbosacral plexus and sympathetic chain. Signs of sympathetic deafferentation (the 'hot foot') may be the earliest and only sign in this situation. This sign may be missed unless it is anticipated and a thorough physical examination carried out.  Conclusion:   Evans' sign is important because it may be an early and solitary sign of retroperitoneal recurrence of pelvic (cervix, rectum, bladder, ovary and prostate) cancers. Recognition of this finding when intractable pain in the back and leg occurs with a history of this type of cancer could lead to earlier and more successful treatment.""","""['R J Evans', 'C Peter N Watson']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Pain Res Manag""","""[""'Trident sign' in pelvis: sinister sign with poor prognosis."", 'Cancers of the uterine cervix in Port Harcourt, Rivers State--a 13-year clinico-pathological review.', 'No. 385-Indications for Pelvic Examination.', 'Peripheral Arterial Disease – Diagnosis and Treatment: A Systematic Review Internet.', 'Cutaneous metastasis from squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix.', 'Surgical Management of Symptomatic Lumbar, Sacral, and Lumbosacral Plexus Tumors: a Peripheral Nerve Unit Experience.', 'Neurological complications of systemic tumor therapy.']"""

The authors of this report examined providers' decision-making regarding discontinuing PSA screening.  Methods:   A survey of primary providers from a large, university-affiliated primary care practice was administered. Providers were asked about their current screening practices, factors that influenced their decision to discontinue screening, and barriers to discontinuing screening. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to examine whether taking age and/or life expectancy into account and barriers to discontinuing were associated with clinician characteristics and practice styles.  Results:   One hundred twenty-five of 141 providers (88.7%) participated in the survey. Over half (59.3%) took both age and life expectancy into account, whereas 12.2% did not consider either in their decisions to discontinue PSA screening. Providers varied in the age at which they typically stopped screening patients, and the majority (66.4%) reported difficulty in assessing life expectancy. Taking patient age and life expectancy into account was not associated with provider characteristics or practice styles. The most frequently cited barriers to discontinuing PSA screening were patient expectation (74.4%) and time constraints (66.4%). Black providers were significantly less likely than nonblack providers to endorse barriers related to time constraints and clinical uncertainty, although these results were limited by the small sample size of black providers.  Conclusions:   Although age and life expectancy often figured prominently in decisions to use screening, providers faced multiple barriers to discontinuing routine PSA screening.""","""['Craig E Pollack', 'Elizabeth A Platz', 'Nrupen A Bhavsar', 'Gary Noronha', 'Gene E Green', 'Sean Chen', 'H Ballentine Carter']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Cancer""","""['Medical center characteristics associated with PSA screening in elderly veterans with limited life expectancy.', 'Primary Care Physicians Beliefs about Prostate-Specific Antigen Evidence Uncertainty, Screening Efficacy, and Test Use.', 'Prostate cancer screening using prostate-specific antigen: The views of general and laboratory physicians.', 'Clarifying uncertainty regarding detection and treatment of early-stage prostate cancer.', 'The Aging Mountaineer: PSA screening in older men--of value or should we skip this test?', 'Initial Longitudinal Outcomes of Risk-Stratified Men in Their Forties Screened for Prostate Cancer Following Implementation of a Baseline Prostate-Specific Antigen.', 'A mixed-methods study of multi-level factors influencing mammography overuse among an older ethnically diverse screening population: implications for de-implementation.', 'Examining primary care physician rationale for not following geriatric choosing wisely recommendations.', ""Examining Older Adults' Attitudes and Perceptions of Cancer Screening and Overscreening: A Qualitative Study."", 'Assessment of Clinician Decision-making on Cancer Screening Cessation in Older Adults With Limited Life Expectancy.']"""

Three multileaf collimators (MLCs) were modeled: two 10 mm leaf width MLCs, with and without interdigitating leafs, and a 5 mm leaf width MLC with interdigitating leafs. Three rectum patients and three prostate patients were used for the planning study. In order to compare treatment techniques in an objective way, a Pareto front comparison was carried out. 200 plans were generated in an automated way, per patient per MLC model, resulting in a total of 3600 plans. From these plans, Pareto-optimal plans were selected which were evaluated for various dosimetric variables. The capability of leaf interdigitation showed little dosimetric impact on the treatment plans, when comparing the 10 mm leaf width MLC with and without leaf interdigitation. When comparing the 10 mm leaf width MLC with the 5 mm leaf width MLC, both with interdigitating leafs, improvement in plan quality was observed. For both patient groups, the integral dose was reduced by 0.6 J for the thin MLC. For the prostate patients, the mean dose to the anal sphincter was reduced by 1.8 Gy and the conformity of the V(95%) was reduced by 0.02 using the thin MLC. The V(65%) of the rectum was reduced by 0.1% and the dose homogeneity with 1.5%. For rectum patients, the mean dose to the bowel was reduced by 1.4 Gy and the mean dose to the bladder with 0.8 Gy for the thin MLC. The conformity of the V(95%) was equivalent for the 10 and 5 mm leaf width MLCs for the rectum patients.

Family history of PrCa, particularly at a young age, is a strong risk factor. There have been previous reports of increased PrCa risk in male BRCA1 mutation carriers in female breast cancer families, but there is a controversy as to whether this risk is substantiated. We sought to evaluate the role of germline BRCA1 mutations in PrCa predisposition by performing a candidate gene study in a large UK population sample set.  Methods:   We screened 913 cases aged 36–86 years for germline BRCA1 mutation, with the study enriched for cases with an early age of onset. We analysed the entire coding region of the BRCA1 gene using Sanger sequencing. Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification was also used to assess the frequency of large rearrangements in 460 cases.  Results:   We identified 4 deleterious mutations and 45 unclassified variants (UV). The frequency of deleterious BRCA1 mutation in this study is 0.45%; three of the mutation carriers were affected at age 65 years and one developed PrCa at 69 years. Using previously estimated population carrier frequencies, deleterious BRCA1 mutations confer a relative risk of PrCa of ~3.75-fold, (95% confidence interval 1.02–9.6) translating to a 8.6% cumulative risk by age 65.  Conclusion:   This study shows evidence for an increased risk of PrCa in men who harbour germline mutations in BRCA1. This could have a significant impact on possible screening strategies and targeted treatments.""","""['D Leongamornlert', 'N Mahmud', 'M Tymrakiewicz', 'E Saunders', 'T Dadaev', 'E Castro', 'C Goh', 'K Govindasami', 'M Guy', ""L O'Brien"", 'E Sawyer', 'A Hall', 'R Wilkinson', 'D Easton;UKGPCS Collaborators;D Goldgar', 'R Eeles', 'Z Kote-Jarai']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Br J Cancer""","""['The role of germline mutations in the BRCA1/2 and mismatch repair genes in men ascertained for early-onset and/or familial prostate cancer.', 'Interim Results from the IMPACT Study: Evidence for Prostate-specific Antigen Screening in BRCA2 Mutation Carriers.', 'BRCA2 is a moderate penetrance gene contributing to young-onset prostate cancer: implications for genetic testing in prostate cancer patients.', 'Genetic predisposition to prostate cancer.', 'Updates in Prostate Cancer Research and Screening in Men at Genetically Higher Risk.', 'Impact of DNA damage repair alterations on prostate cancer progression and metastasis.', 'Recent Research Advances in Double-Strand Break and Mismatch Repair Defects in Prostate Cancer and Potential Clinical Applications.', 'BRCA mutations detected by tumour next-generation sequencing in non-small cell lung cancer: impact on response to therapy and disease course.', 'Clinical characteristics and prostate-cancer-specific mortality of competitive risk nomogram in the second primary prostate cancer.', 'The Prevalence of CHEK1 and CHEK2 Mutations in Prostate Cancer: a Retrospective Cohort Study.']"""

Materials and methods:   A single institution cohort of 2,487 men with cT1-T2 CaP treated with open radical prostatectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection between 1988 and 2008 were analyzed. Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional regression models were used to analyze overall survival (OS), clinical recurrence-free survival (cRFS), and biochemical recurrence-free survival (bRFS).  Results:   Overall, 150 out of 2,487 patients (6%) had pN1 disease, with a median follow-up of 10.4 years. The predicted 10-year OS, cRFS, and bRFS rates for patients with pN0 and pN1 were 86% and 74% (Log rank P < 0.001), 97% and 84% (Log rank P < 0.001), and 88% and 57% (Log rank P < 0.001), respectively. In the subset of pN1 patients treated with surgery only (n = 49), the predicted 10-year OS, cRFS, and bRFS rates were 81%, 80%, and 59%, respectively. Exploratory univariate regression analysis showed that age (P = 0.003), total number of lymph nodes identified (P = 0.040), and total number of positive lymph nodes identified (P = 0.004) were associated with OS. Total number of positive lymph nodes (LNs) identified was also significantly associated with cRFS (P = 0.05).

Results:   For patients with Stage T1c disease, the AUC for the PSA ROC curve increased in a stepwise fashion as both the total cancer volume and the high-grade cancer volume increased. Significant differences between the AUCs for low and high volumes of total and high-grade disease were observed. For T2 disease, the AUCs for predicting high-grade cancer volume were generally greater than the corresponding AUCs for T1c disease, although no incremental increase was observed.  Conclusion:   In patients with Stage T1c disease, in whom the PSA level was the driving force for biopsy, the PSA performance improved in a stepwise fashion with greater total and high-grade cancer volumes as evidenced by improved ROC.

In the current study, we found that Axl is highly expressed in metastatic prostate cancer cell lines PC3 and DU145 and has negligible levels of expression in a nonmetastatic cancer cell line LNCaP. Knockdown of Axl in PC3 and DU145 cells resulted in decreased expression of several mesenchymal markers including Snail, Slug, and N-cadherin, and enhanced expression of the epithelial marker E-cadherin, suggesting that Axl is involved in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition in prostate cancer cells. The Axl-knockdown PC3 and DU145 cells also displayed decreased in vitro migration and invasion. Interestingly, when PC3 and DU145 cells were treated with GAS6, Axl protein levels were downregulated. Moreover, CoCl(2), a hypoxia mimicking agent, prevented GAS6-mediated downregulation of Axl in these cell lines. Immunochemical staining of human prostate cancer tissue microarrays showed that Axl, GAS6, and hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (Hif-1α; indicator of hypoxia) were all coexpressed in prostate cancer and in bone metastases compared with normal tissues. Together, our studies indicate that Axl plays a crucial role in prostate cancer metastasis and that GAS6 regulates the expression of Axl.

The prostate specific antigen (PSA) is characterized by its imperfections justifying the evaluation of new serum or urinary specific markers allowing a better selection of patients at risk of developing aggressive Pca.  Aim:   To compare the value of -2pro PSA and phi index to total and free PSA.  Methods:   Serum sampled from 452 patients from two university centers were used to determine levels of PSA before performing biopsies. The patients were included in this study based on the PSA serum concentration between 1.6 ng/mL and 8 ng/mL according to the WHO international standard. All biopsies were performed according to a standardized protocol consisting of 12 cores or more. Sera were analyzed centrally in one of the two institutions with on a single analyzer. Sera from 243 prostate cancer and 208 negative biopsies patients have been taken into account.  Results:   Sera were analyzed blinded for total PSA, free PSA and [-2] proPSA using Access(®) immunoassay method from Beckman Coulter. The Prostate Health Index (phi) was calculated using the formula phi=([-2] proPSA/fPSA)×sqrt (PSA). The median value of the phi index is significantly (P>0.0001) higher for patients with cancer (phi=65.8) compared to patients with negative biopsies (phi=40.6). At a given sensitivity, the phi index significantly increases the specificity of detection of prostate cancer compared to other markers.  Conclusion:   The phi index currently appears as the best predictor of prostate cancer for patients with a total PSA between 1.6 and 8 ng/mL according to the WHO standard. The improvement in specificity of the phi index over tPSA could reduce significantly the numbers of unnecessary biopsies.

In this regard, targeting aberrant angiogenesis through non-toxic phytochemicals could be an attractive angiopreventive strategy against PCA. The rationale of the present study was to compare the anti-angiogenic potential of four pure diastereoisomeric flavonolignans, namely silybin A, silybin B, isosilybin A and isosilybin B, which we established previously as biologically active constituents in Milk Thistle extract. Results showed that oral feeding of these flavonolignans (50 and 100 mg/kg body weight) effectively inhibit the growth of advanced human PCA DU145 xenografts. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed that these flavonolignans inhibit tumor angiogenesis biomarkers (CD31 and nestin) and signaling molecules regulating angiogenesis (VEGF, VEGFR1, VEGFR2, phospho-Akt and HIF-1α) without adversely affecting the vessel-count in normal tissues (liver, lung, and kidney) of tumor bearing mice. These flavonolignans also inhibited the microvessel sprouting from mouse dorsal aortas ex vivo, and the VEGF-induced cell proliferation, capillary-like tube formation and invasiveness of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) in vitro. Further studies in HUVEC showed that these diastereoisomers target cell cycle, apoptosis and VEGF-induced signaling cascade. Three dimensional growth assay as well as co-culture invasion and in vitro angiogenesis studies (with HUVEC and DU145 cells) suggested the differential effectiveness of the diastereoisomers toward PCA and endothelial cells.

Epithelial cell fractions were isolated, including Epcam(+)CD44(+) and Epcam+CD44+CD49f(Hi) basal cells that formed abundant spheres. When non-sphere-forming Epcam(+)CD44(-) cells were fractionated based upon CD49f expression, a distinct subpopulation (Epcam(+)CD44(-)CD49f(Hi)) was identified that possessed a basal profile similar to Epcam(+)CD44(+)CD49f(Hi) sphere-forming cells (p63(+)AR(Lo)PSA(-)). Evaluation of tubule induction capability of fractionated cells was performed, in vivo, via a fully humanized prostate tissue regeneration assay.

Further fractionation based upon CD49f co-expression identified Epcam(+)CD44(-)CD49f(Hi) (non-sphere-forming) basal cells with significantly increased tubule induction activity compared to Epcam(+)CD44(-)CD49f(Lo) (true) luminal cells.  Conclusions/significance:   Our data delineates antigenic profiles that functionally distinguish human prostate epithelial subpopulations, including putative SCs that display superior tubule initiation capability and induce differentiated ductal/acini structures, sphere-forming PCs with relatively decreased tubule initiation activity, and terminally differentiated LCs that lack both sphere-forming and tubule-initiation activity. The results clearly demonstrate that sphere-forming ability is not predictive of tubule-initiation activity. The subpopulations identified are of interest because they may play distinct roles as cells of origin in the development of prostatic diseases, including cancer.""","""['Changyong Guo', 'Haibo Liu', 'Bao-Hui Zhang', 'Radu M Cadaneanu', 'Aqila M Mayle', 'Isla P Garraway']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Differential gene expression profiling of functionally and developmentally distinct human prostate epithelial populations.', 'Human prostate sphere-forming cells represent a subset of basal epithelial cells capable of glandular regeneration in vivo.', 'Identification and expansion of a unique stem cell population from adult mouse gallbladder.', 'CD49f is an efficient marker of monolayer- and spheroid colony-forming cells of the benign and malignant human prostate.', 'CD44 and EpCAM: cancer-initiating cell markers.', 'Generation of human tonsil epithelial organoids as an ex vivo model for SARS-CoV-2 infection.', 'Establishment and characterization of prostate organoids from treatment-naïve patients with prostate cancer.', 'Live cell molecular analysis of primary prostate cancer organoids identifies persistent androgen receptor signaling.', 'Vitamin D sufficiency enhances differentiation of patient-derived prostate epithelial organoids.', 'Dynamics of Cellular Plasticity in Prostate Cancer Progression.']"""

Gap junctions, formed of proteins called connexins, are ensembles of intercellular channels that permit the exchange of small growth regulatory molecules between adjoining cells. Gap junctional communication is instrumental in the control of cell growth. We examined the effect of 9-cis-retinoic acid and all-trans retinoic acid on the formation and degradation of gap junctions as well as on junctional communication in an androgen-responsive prostate cancer cell line, LNCaP, which expressed retrovirally introduced connexin32, a connexin expressed by the luminal cells and well-differentiated cells of prostate tumors. Our results showed that 9-cis-retinoic acid and all-trans retinoic acid enhanced the assembly of connexin32 into gap junctions. Our results further showed that 9-cis-retinoic acid and all-trans-retinoic acid prevented androgen-regulated degradation of gap junctions, post-translationally, independent of androgen receptor mediated signaling. Finally, our findings showed that formation of gap junctions sensitized connexin32-expressing LNCaP cells to the growth modifying effects of 9-cis-retinoic acid, all-trans-retinoic acid and androgens. Thus, the effects of retinoids and androgens on growth and the formation and degradation of gap junctions and their function might be related to their ability to modulate prostate growth and cancer.""","""['Linda Kelsey', 'Parul Katoch', 'Kristen E Johnson', 'Surinder K Batra', 'Parmender P Mehta']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Vitamin D3 regulates the formation and degradation of gap junctions in androgen-responsive human prostate cancer cells.', 'Androgen-regulated formation and degradation of gap junctions in androgen-responsive human prostate cancer cells.', 'Control of LNCaP proliferation and differentiation: actions and interactions of androgens, 1alpha,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol, all-trans retinoic acid, 9-cis retinoic acid, and phenylacetate.', 'Natural and synthetic retinoids in prostate cancer.', 'Regulation of gap junction intercellular communication by the ubiquitin system.', 'Src Regulation of Cx43 Phosphorylation and Gap Junction Turnover.', 'Direct Intercellular Communications and Cancer: A Snapshot of the Biological Roles of Connexins in Prostate Cancer.', 'A near infrared light-triggerable modular formulation for the delivery of small biomolecules.', 'Gap junctions and cancer: communicating for 50 years.', 'Kinase programs spatiotemporally regulate gap junction assembly and disassembly: Effects on wound repair.']"""

Methods:   We investigated the effects of different diets on prostate cancer cell growth and the relevant circulating factors including serum insulin, growth factors, and inflammatory cytokines using the in vivo and ex vivo model.  Results:   The tumor growth of prostate cancer LNCaP xenograft was significantly higher in the HFD group than in the HCD and control diet (CD) groups (P = 0.01; HFD vs. HCD, P = 0.025; HFD vs. CD, P = 0.003).

Herein, we provide the first evaluation of the ability of staining levels of the tumor based biomarkers MDM2, p16, and p53 to aid in prediction of biochemical recurrence (BCR) among men undergoing SRT for recurrent prostate cancer.  Material and methods:   We identified 152 patients who were treated with SRT between July 1987 and July 2003. Staining levels of MDM2, p16, and p53 in primary tumor samples removed during prostatectomy were detected using monoclonal antibodies and quantified by use of a computer-assisted method. Associations of staining levels with BCR were evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression models; relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated.  Results:   Compared to patients with low staining (≤median) as measured by percentage of cells with nuclear staining, there was no significant difference in risk of BCR for patients with high MDM2 staining (RR: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.57-1.45, P = 0.67), high p16 staining (RR: 0.88, 95% CI: 0.54-1.44, P = 0.62), or high p53 staining (RR: 1.33, 95% CI: 0.84-2.11, P = 0.23) in multivariable analysis. These results were consistent when considering alternate percentile cutpoints and alternate quantifications of biomarker staining.

Recent evidence supports the idea that PC is initiated by a subset of cells, termed cancer stem cells (CSCs). CSCs have also been implicated in radioresistance in various malignancies, but their role in PC has not yet been investigated.  Methods:   We compared the relative radiosensitivity of isolated CSCs to the total population of their corresponding cell lines, and examined the relative numbers of CSCs in irradiated cell lines following long-term recovery and in recurrent human PC.  Results:   Here, we show that while irradiation does not immediately favor increased survival of CSCs, irradiated PC cell lines showed an increase in CSC properties with long-term recovery.

The Monte Carlo code specifies the treatment head at MGH with sub-millimeter accuracy. The code was configured based on the results of experimental measurements performed at MGH. This model was then used to compare out-of-field doses in simulated DS treatments and PBS treatments. For the conditions explored, the penumbra in PBS is wider than in DS, leading to higher absorbed doses and equivalent doses adjacent to the primary field edge. For lateral distances greater than 10 cm from the field edge, the doses in PBS appear to be lower than those observed for DS. We found that placing a patient-specific aperture at nozzle exit during PBS treatments can potentially reduce doses lateral to the primary radiation field by over an order of magnitude.

In humans, many polymorphic sites within the RNASEL gene have been associated with an increased risk of developing prostate cancer. Here, we obtained coding sequences for the RNASEL gene from 11 primates and found evidence that positive selection has operated on the C-terminal endoribonuclease domain and the N-terminal ankyrin repeats domain of the protein, domains that directly interact with virus (i.e., ankyrin repeats are responsible for receiving environmental signals, and the endoribonuclease catalyses the destruction of the pathogenic viral RNA). To extend this finding, we studied variation within this gene in modern human populations by resequencing alleles from 144 individuals representing four separate populations. Interestingly, the frequency of the 541D allele shows a negative association with the incidence rate of prostate cancer in worldwide populations, and haplotypes containing the 541D polymorphisms demonstrate signatures of positive selection. RNASEL variants having the 541D haplotype likely have a greater ability to defend against infections by viruses, thus the loss of this activity may be associated with the development of prostate cancer.

Transrectal ultrasound images can, however, be used for the entire process, allowing treatment without changes in the patient position. This study assesses needle reconstruction accuracy using US images.  Methods and materials:   Prostate phantoms were implanted with 10-18 needles. Three-dimensional US images were acquired, and needles were reconstructed using specialized software. A CT scan was also obtained. The image sets were registered and needle reconstruction errors were assessed. A dose plan was obtained using the US images and the dwell times were transferred to the CT reconstruction to obtain the true ""delivered dose,"" which was evaluated using standard dosimetric parameters.  Results:   Two sources of error were identified. First, reconstruction based on the bright echoes in the US images introduces a systematic error because these echoes correspond to the proximal wall of the needle, and not the center of the needle channel. If left uncorrected, this shift can lead to an underestimate of urethral doses. Second, incorrect needle tip identification can occur in the cranial-caudal direction. Errors up to 5.8mm were observed. A measurement of needle lengths protruding beyond the template can be used to compensate for this.  Conclusions:   Factors limiting the accuracy of US-based needle reconstruction have been identified. Once recognized, these errors can be corrected for, resulting in accurate implant geometry.

This intervention, accomplished transurethrally, is both diagnostic and potentially therapeutic for patients with bladder cancer, especially for low grade, non muscle-invasive bladder tumors. Although usually safe and sufficient, this technique can create technical challenges, especially in the dynamically changing spherical space of the bladder. Bipolar energy has been available for many years and has been readily adopted for the endoscopic treatment of benign prostatic enlargement. A further refinement on bipolar energy has been the recent introduction of the Olympus Button Electrode (Olympus, Southborough, MA, USA). Coupling bipolar energy into the Olympus Button Electrode not only harnesses the benefits of less thermal spread but also obviates many of the geometric challenges associated with loop electrodes during resection of either large or inauspiciously placed bladder tumors.

Materials and methods:   Seventy patients accrued to the pHART3 (n = 84) study were analyzed for out-of-pocket patient costs as a result of undergoing treatment. All costs are in Canadian dollars. Using the postal code of the patient's residence, the distance between the hospital and patient home was found using Google Maps. The Canada Revenue Agency automobile allowance rate was then applied to determine the cost per kilometer driven.  Results:   The average cost of travel from the hospital and pHART3 patient's residence was $246 per person after five trips. In a standard fractionation regimen, pHART3 patients would have incurred an average cost of $1921 after 39 visits. The patients receiving hypofractionated radiotherapy would have paid an average of $38 in parking while those receiving conventional treatment would have paid $293. The difference in out-of-pocket costs for the patients receiving a standard versus hypofractionated treatment was $1930.  Conclusions:   Medium term prospective data shows that hypofractionated radiotherapy is an effective treatment method for localized prostate cancer. Compared to standard EBRT, hypofractionated radiotherapy requires significantly fewer visits. Due to the long distance patients may have to travel to the cancer center and the expense of parking, the short course treatment saves each patient an average of $1900. A randomized study of standard versus hypofractionated accelerated radiotherapy should be conducted to confirm a favorable efficacy and tolerability profile of the shorter fractionation scheme.""","""['Perakaa Sethukavalan', 'Patrick Cheung', 'Colin I Tang', 'Harvey Quon', 'Gerard Morton', 'Robert Nam', 'Andrew Loblaw']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Can J Urol""","""['The changing costs of radiation treatment for early prostate cancer in Ontario: a comparison between conventional and conformal external beam radiotherapy.', 'Acute genitourinary toxicity after high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy combined with hypofractionated external-beam radiation therapy for localized prostate cancer: correlation between the urethral dose in HDR brachytherapy and the severity of acute genitourinary toxicity.', 'Acute genitourinary toxicity after high dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy combined with hypofractionated external-beam radiation therapy for localized prostate cancer: Second analysis to determine the correlation between the urethral dose in HDR brachytherapy and the severity of acute genitourinary toxicity.', 'Hypofractionated radiation therapy for prostate cancer: risks and potential benefits in a fiscally conservative health care system.', 'Hypofractionated Radiotherapy for Localized Prostate Cancer: When and for Whom?', 'A prospective randomized comparative study to evaluate the effect of palliative hypo-fractionated radiotherapy with concurrent chemotherapy versus hypo-fractionated radiotherapy alone in advanced and unresectable head and neck cancer with no metastasis.', 'Benefits of Adopting Hypofractionated Radiotherapy as a Standard of Care in Low-and Middle-Income Countries.', 'Shorter Radiation Regimens and Treatment Noncompletion Among Patients With Breast and Prostate Cancer in the United States: An Analysis of Racial Disparities in Access and Quality.', 'Impact of centralization of prostate cancer services on the choice of radical treatment.', 'Quality-of-Life Outcomes and Toxic Effects Among Patients With Cancers of the Uterus Treated With Stereotactic Pelvic Adjuvant Radiation Therapy: The SPARTACUS Phase 1/2 Nonrandomized Controlled Trial.']"""

We report on whether selective focal ablation of unifocal and multifocal cancer lesions can reduce this treatment burden.  Methods:   Men aged 45-80 years were eligible for this prospective development study if they had low-risk to high-risk localised prostate cancer (prostate specific antigen [PSA] ≤15 ng/mL, Gleason score ≤4 + 3, stage ≤T2), with no previous androgen deprivation or treatment for prostate cancer, and who could safely undergo multiparametric MRI and have a general anaesthetic. Patients received focal therapy using high-intensity focused ultrasound, delivered to all known cancer lesions, with a margin of normal tissue, identified on multiparametric MRI, template prostate-mapping biopsies, or both. Primary endpoints were adverse events (serious and otherwise) and urinary symptoms and erectile function assessed using patient questionnaires. Analyses were done on a per-protocol basis. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00561314.  Findings:   42 men were recruited between June 27, 2007, and June 30, 2010; one man died from an unrelated cause (pneumonia) 3 months after treatment and was excluded from analyses. After treatment, one man was admitted to hospital for acute urinary retention, and another had stricture interventions requiring hospital admission. Nine men (22%, 95% CI 11-38) had self-resolving, mild to moderate, intermittent dysuria (median duration 5·0 days [IQR 2·5-18·5]). Urinary debris occurred in 14 men (34%, 95% CI 20-51), with a median duration of 14·5 days (IQR 6·0-16·5). Urinary tract infection was noted in seven men (17%, 95% CI 7-32). Median overall International Index of Erectile Function-15 (IIEF-15) scores were similar at baseline and at 12 months (p=0·060), as were median IIEF-15 scores for intercourse satisfaction (p=0·454), sexual desire (p=0·644), and overall satisfaction (p=0·257). Significant deteriorations between baseline and 12 months were noted for IIEF-15 erectile (p=0·042) and orgasmic function (p=0·003). Of 35 men with good baseline function, 31 (89%, 95% CI 73-97) had erections sufficient for penetration 12 months after focal therapy. Median UCLA Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) urinary incontinence scores were similar at baseline as and 12 months (p=0·045). There was an improvement in lower urinary tract symptoms, assessed by International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), between baseline and 12 months (p=0·026), but the IPSS-quality of life score showed no difference between baseline and 12 months (p=0·655). All 38 men with no baseline urinary incontinence were leak-free and pad-free by 9 months. All 40 men pad-free at baseline were pad-free by 3 months and maintained pad-free continence at 12 months. No significant difference was reported in median Trial Outcomes Index scores between baseline and 12 months (p=0·113) but significant improvement was shown in median Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT)-Prostate (p=0·045) and median FACT-General scores (p=0·041). No histological evidence of cancer was identified in 30 of 39 men biopsied at 6 months (77%, 95% CI 61-89); 36 (92%, 79-98) were free of clinically significant cancer. After retreatment in four men, 39 of 41 (95%, 95% CI 83-99) had no evidence of disease on multiparametric MRI at 12 months.  Interpretation:   Focal therapy of individual prostate cancer lesions, whether multifocal or unifocal, leads to a low rate of genitourinary side-effects and an encouraging rate of early absence of clinically significant prostate cancer.

The source of tumor heterogeneity and the accompanying mechanisms leading to treatment resistance are major areas of prostate cancer research. Although our understanding of tumor heterogeneity is evolving, the functional isolation of tumor propagating populations, also known as cancer stem cells (CSCs), is fundamental to the identification and molecular characterization of castration-resistant prostate cancer cells. Of clinical importance, knowledge of prostate CSCs has implications for design of next generation-targeted therapies aimed at both eradicating primary tumor mass and preventing castration-resistant disease. The inability to routinely transplant fractionated primary human prostate tumors has prevented progress in analyzing the source of heterogeneous and treatment-resistant populations in prostate cancer.

We previously identified (3α,5β)-3-hydroxycholan-24-oic acid (lithocholic acid) as an Eph-ephrin antagonist that is able to inhibit EphA2 receptor activation; it is therefore potentially useful as a novel EphA2 receptor-targeting agent. Herein we explore the structure-activity relationships of a focused set of lithocholic acid derivatives based on molecular modeling investigations and displacement binding assays. Our exploration shows that while the 3-α-hydroxy group of lithocholic acid has a negligible role in recognition of the EphA2 receptor, its carboxylate group is critical for disrupting the binding of ephrinA1 to EphA2. As a result of our investigation, we identified (5β)-cholan-24-oic acid (cholanic acid) as a novel compound that competitively inhibits the EphA2-ephrinA1 interaction with higher potency than lithocholic acid. Surface plasmon resonance analysis indicates that cholanic acid binds specifically and reversibly to the ligand binding domain of EphA2, with a steady-state dissociation constant (K(D) ) in the low micromolar range. Furthermore, cholanic acid blocks the phosphorylation of EphA2 as well as cell retraction and rounding in PC3 prostate cancer cells, two effects that depend on EphA2 activation by the ephrinA1 ligand. These findings suggest that cholanic acid can be used as a template structure for the design of effective EphA2 antagonists, and may have potential impact in the elucidation of the role played by this receptor in pathological conditions.""","""['Massimiliano Tognolini', 'Matteo Incerti', 'Iftiin Hassan-Mohamed', 'Carmine Giorgio', 'Simonetta Russo', 'Renato Bruni', 'Barbara Lelli', 'Luisa Bracci', 'Roberta Noberini', 'Elena B Pasquale', 'Elisabetta Barocelli', 'Paola Vicini', 'Marco Mor', 'Alessio Lodola']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""ChemMedChem""","""['Synthesis and structure-activity relationships of amino acid conjugates of cholanic acid as antagonists of the EphA2 receptor.', 'UniPR129 is a competitive small molecule Eph-ephrin antagonist blocking in vitro angiogenesis at low micromolar concentrations.', 'Amino acid conjugates of lithocholic acid as antagonists of the EphA2 receptor.', 'The EphA2 receptor and ephrinA1 ligand in solid tumors: function and therapeutic targeting.', 'Roles of EphA1/A2 and ephrin-A1 in cancer.', 'Conjugation as a Tool in Therapeutics: Role of Amino Acids/Peptides-Bioactive (Including Heterocycles) Hybrid Molecules in Treating Infectious Diseases.', 'Optimization of the Lead Compound NVP-BHG712 as a Colorectal Cancer Inhibitor.', 'Protein-Protein Interaction Inhibitors Targeting the Eph-Ephrin System with a Focus on Amino Acid Conjugates of Bile Acids.', 'Lipophilic Conjugates for Carrier-Free Delivery of RNA Importable into Human Mitochondria.', 'Targeting EphA2 in cancer.']"""

Unfortunately, few successful therapies for castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) exist. The protein kinase A (PKA) pathway is a critical mediator of cellular proliferation and differentiation in various normal and cancerous cells. However, the PKA activity and the mechanism of regulation in CRPC remain unclear. Then, in this study, we intended to reveal the PKA activity and the mechanism of regulation in CRPC.  Methods:   Western blotting, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, cytotoxicity analysis, and cell proliferation assay were used to resolve the regulatory role of PKA in prostate cancer cell line, LNCaP and their derivatives.  Results:   cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase 4B (PDE4B) was downregulated and the PKA pathway was activated in castration-resistant LNCaP derivatives (CxR cells). Rolipram activated the PKA pathway via inhibition of PDE4B, resulting in AR transactivation while the PKA inhibitor, H89 reduced AR transactivation. In response to hydrogen peroxide and in hydrogen peroxide-resistant LNCaP derivatives (HPR50 cells) PDE4B was decreased and as a result PKA activity was increased. Moreover, PDE4B expression was reduced in advanced prostate cancer and PDE4B knockdown promoted castration-resistant growth of LNCaP cells.

We and others have demonstrated that PAP-specific T-cell responses can be elicited and augmented following antigen-specific immunization in both humans and animal models. We have previously reported that prostate cancer patients immunized with a DNA vaccine encoding PAP (pTVG-HP) developed both CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses. PAP-specific, CD4+ T-cell proliferative responses were generated in three out of four HLA-DRB1*0101 patients suggesting the possibility that DR1-restricted epitopes exist.  Methods:   To identify PAP-specific HLA-DRB1*0101 restricted epitopes, we immunized HLA-A2.01/HLA-DRB1*0101 (A2/DR1) transgenic mice with the pTVG-HP DNA vaccine. To map DRB1*0101-restricted epitopes, splenocytes from immunized mice were screened against a library of overlapping 15-residue, PAP-derived peptides using an IFNγ ELISPOT assay.  Results:   We identified four HLA-DRB1*0101 epitopes for PAP in A2/DR1 mice (PAP(161-175) , PAP(181-195) , PAP(191-205) , and PAP (351-365) ). T cells specific for one epitope (PAP(181-195) ) were found to be augmented after immunization in a HLA-DRB1*0101+ prostate cancer patient.

Methods:   A total of 1,016 bladder cancer inpatients from October 1995 to October 2005 and 804 outpatients from January 2004 to January 2006 were enrolled in this study. Each patient provided the morning urine specimen of 30-50 ml in a sterile container. Urine sediments were stained by acridine orange and observed with a fluorescence microscope; 60 bladder cancer inpatients from January 2006 to July 2007 were also chosen for the control study of three different detection methods, including AO-F, hematoxylin and eosin and Feulgen staining.  Results:   Of the 1,016 bladder carcinoma samples analyzed, 793 were AO-F positive. Total positive rate of AO-F was 78.05 %. The positive rate was 74.69 % (611/818) for non-muscle invasive bladder carcinoma and 91.91 % (182/198) for muscle invasive bladder carcinoma. A significant correlation of AO-F positivity with clinical stage was observed (P < 0.01).

Current approaches do not effectively engage cancer survivors or advocacy groups. A group of clinicians in collaboration with the Canadian Urologic Association held a forum for GU cancer survivors, advocacy groups, and health professionals to explore ways to collaboratively enhance survivorship care.  Methods:   Participants attended a 2-day conference that included presentations, breakout groups, and a postconference survey. Discussions by breakout groups were recorded and analyzed alongside open-ended survey responses for common themes. Basic statistics were calculated.  Results:   Conference participants (n = 42) included 18 cancer survivors/caregivers, 21 health professionals, and 3 researchers representing bladder, kidney, prostate, and testis cancer groups. Breakout group discussions and responses to the postconference survey (83.3 % response rate) showed strong support for greater collaboration among all parties. Strategies to facilitate collaboration reflected a need to: (1) raise awareness of the shared and unique needs of GU cancer survivors and the expertise of cancer advocacy groups, (2) facilitate communication and collaborative opportunities among clinicians/researchers and cancer survivors/advocacy groups, (3) facilitate collaborative programming and fund-raising among GU advocacy groups, and (4) synthesize and facilitate access to GU cancer survivorship resources and services.  Conclusions:   There is strong support for formal collaboration to enhance survivorship care among a critical mass of GU cancer survivors, advocacy groups, clinicians, and researchers. Responsibility for collaboration lies with all stakeholder groups. Strategies to foster such partnerships should employ integrated knowledge translation approaches that actively engage all parties throughout the entire research to practice process.  Implications for cancer survivors:   Successful partnerships between cancer survivors, advocacy groups, clinicians, and researchers require familiarity with each other's expertise, along with sufficient resources and organizational structures.

Methods:   Forty-one patients with biopsy-proven PCa underwent endorectal 3-T MRI before prostatectomy. Different combinations of b values (0-800 s/mm(2)) were used to calculate four representative ADC maps. Mean ADCs of tumours and non-malignant tissue were determined. Tumour appearance on different ADC maps was rated by three radiologists as good, fair or poor by assigning a visual score (VS) of 2, 1 or 0, respectively. Differences in the ADC values with the choice of b values were analysed using one-way ANOVA.  Results:   Choice of b values had a highly (P < 0.001) significant influence on the absolute ADC in each tissue. Maps using b = [50, 800] and [0, 800] were rated best (VS= 1.6 ± 0.3) and second best (1.1 ± 0.3, P < 0.001), respectively. For low-grade carcinomas (Gleason score ≤ 6, 13/41 patients), only the former choice received scores better than fair (VS = 1.4 ± 0.3). Mean tumour ADCs showed significant negative correlation (Spearman's ρ -0.38 to -0.46, P < 0.05) with Gleason score.  Conclusions:   Absolute ADC values strongly depend on the choice of b values and therefore should be used with caution for diagnostic purposes. A minimum b value greater than zero is recommended for ADC calculation to improve the visual assessment of PCa in ADC maps.  Key points:   • Absolute ADC values are highly dependent on the choice of b values. • Absolute ADC thresholds should be used carefully to predict tumour aggressiveness. • Subjective ratings of ADC maps involving b = 0 s/mm ( 2 ) are poor to fair. • Minimum b value greater than 0 s/mm ( 2 ) is recommended for ADC calculation.""","""['Gregor Thörmer', 'Josephin Otto', 'Martin Reiss-Zimmermann', 'Matthias Seiwerts', 'Michael Moche', 'Nikita Garnov', 'Toni Franz', 'Minh Do', 'Jens-Uwe Stolzenburg', 'Lars-Christian Horn', 'Thomas Kahn', 'Harald Busse']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Eur Radiol""","""['Evaluation of Diffusion Kurtosis Imaging Versus Standard Diffusion Imaging for Detection and Grading of Peripheral Zone Prostate Cancer.', 'Prostate cancer aggressiveness: assessment with whole-lesion histogram analysis of the apparent diffusion coefficient.', 'Whole-lesion apparent diffusion coefficient metrics as a marker of percentage Gleason 4 component within Gleason 7 prostate cancer at radical prostatectomy.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Progress in prostate cancer imaging.', 'AI-predicted mpMRI image features for the prediction of clinically significant prostate cancer.', 'Tumor Area Highlighting Using T2WI, ADC Map, and DWI Sequence Fusion on bpMRI Images for Better Prostate Cancer Diagnosis.', 'Introducing new plan evaluation indices for prostate dose painting IMRT plans based on apparent diffusion coefficient images.', 'Feature extraction from MRI ADC images for brain tumor classification using machine learning techniques.', 'Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging at 1.5 T for peripheral zone prostate cancer: the influence of the b-value combination on the diagnostic performance of apparent diffusion coefficient.']"""

This study examines the association between dietary factors associated with prostate cancer and serum levels of these peptides.  Methods:   A cross-sectional analysis of self-reported 12-month dietary intake with serum IGF and IGFBP levels was performed using data from 1,798 subjects screened negative for prostate cancer as part of a UK multicenter trial comparing treatments for this condition. Multivariable linear regression models tested associations of diet with IGFs and IGFBPs.  Results:   For a one standard deviation (SD) increase in dairy product and dairy protein intake, IGF-I increased by 5.28 ng/mL (95 % confidence interval: 2.64, 7.92 ng/mL) and 6.02 ng/mL (3.34, 8.71 ng/mL), respectively.

Although many countries have reduced methyl bromide use because of its ozone depleting properties, some uses remain in the United States and other countries, warranting further investigation of human health effects.  Methods:   We used Poisson regression to calculate rate ratios (RR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) for associations between methyl bromide use and all cancers combined, as well as 12 specific sites, among 53,588 Agricultural Health Study pesticide applicators with follow-up from 1993 to 2007. We also evaluated interactions with a family history for four common cancers (prostate, lung, colon, and lymphohematopoietic). We categorized methyl bromide exposure based on lifetime days applied weighted by an intensity score.  Results:   A total of 7,814 applicators (14.6 %) used methyl bromide, predominantly before enrollment. Based on 15 exposed cases, stomach cancer risk increased monotonically with increasing methyl bromide use (RR = 1.42; 95 % CI, 0.51-3.95 and RR = 3.13; 95 % CI, 1.25-7.80 for low and high use compared with no use; p (trend) = 0.02). No other sites displayed a significant monotonic pattern. Although we previously observed an association with prostate cancer (follow-up through 1999), the association did not persist with longer follow-up. We observed a nonsignificant elevated risk of prostate cancer with methyl bromide use among those with a family history of prostate cancer, but the interaction with a family history did not achieve statistical significance.  Conclusions:   Our results provide little evidence of methyl bromide associations with cancer risk for most sites examined; however, we observed a significant exposure-dependent increase in stomach cancer risk. Small numbers of exposed cases and declining methyl bromide use might have influenced our findings.

Unlike traditionally secreted neuropeptide precursors, however, we find that Ecrg4 localizes to the epithelial cell surface and remains tethered after secretion. Here, we used cell surface biotinylation to establish that 14-kDa Ecrg4 localizes to the cell surface of prostate (PC3) or kidney (HEK) epithelial cells after transfection. Accordingly, this Ecrg4 is resistant to washing cells with neutral, high salt (2 M NaCl), acidic (50 mM glycine, pH 2.8), or basic (100 mM Na(2)CO(3), pH 11) buffers. Mutagenesis of Ecrg4 established that cell tethering was mediated by an NH(2)-terminus hydrophobic leader sequence that enabled both trafficking to the surface and tethering. Immunoblotting analyses, however, showed that different cells process Ecrg4 differently. Whereas PC3 cells release cell surface Ecrg4 to generate soluble Ecrg4 peptides of 6-14 kDa, HEK cells do neither, and the 14-kDa precursor resembles a sentinel attached to the cell surface. Because a phorbol ester treatment of PC3 cells stimulated Ecrg4 release from, and processing at, the cell surface, these data are consistent with a multifunctional role for Ecrg4 that is dependent on its cell of origin and the molecular form produced.""","""['Xitong Dang', 'Sonia Podvin', 'Raul Coimbra', 'Brian Eliceiri', 'Andrew Baird']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Cell Tissue Res""","""['Potential functions of esophageal cancer-related gene-4 in the cardiovascular system.', 'Cell surface localization and release of the candidate tumor suppressor Ecrg4 from polymorphonuclear cells and monocytes activate macrophages.', 'Pulmonary preconditioning, injury, and inflammation modulate expression of the candidate tumor suppressor gene ECRG4 in lung.', 'Open reading frame mining identifies a TLR4 binding domain in the primary sequence of ECRG4.', 'ECRG4: a new potential target in precision medicine.', 'Complex and pleiotropic signaling pathways regulated by the secreted protein augurin.', 'A potential link between aberrant expression of ECRG4 and atrial fibrillation.', 'C2orf40 inhibits metastasis and regulates chemo-resistance and radio-resistance of nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells by influencing cell cycle and activating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.', 'Cardiac Expression of Esophageal Cancer-Related Gene-4 is Regulated by Sp1 and is a Potential Early Target of Doxorubicin-Induced Cardiotoxicity.', 'Potential functions of esophageal cancer-related gene-4 in the cardiovascular system.']"""

In this context, CAR-mediated CD3ζ signaling is sufficient to elicit cytotoxicity and interferon-γ production while the additional provision of CD28-mediated signal 2 promotes T-cell proliferation and interleukin (IL)-2 production. This compartmentalisation of signaling opens the possibility that complementary CARs could be used to focus T-cell activation within the tumor microenvironment.  Methods:   Here, we have tested this principle by co-expressing an ErbB2- and MUC1-specific CAR that signal using CD3ζ and CD28 respectively. Stoichiometric co-expression of transgenes was achieved using the SFG retroviral vector containing an intervening Thosea asigna peptide.  Results:   We found that ""dual-targeted"" T-cells kill ErbB2(+) tumor cells efficiently and proliferate in a manner that requires co-expression of MUC1 and ErbB2 by target cells. Notably, however, IL-2 production was modest when compared to control CAR-engineered T-cells in which signaling is delivered by a fused CD28 + CD3ζ endodomain.

BetA can kill a broad range of tumor cell lines, but has no effect on untransformed cells. The chemical also kills melanoma, leukemia, lung, colon, breast, prostate and ovarian cancer cells via induction of apoptosis, which depends on caspase activation. However, no reports are yet available about the effects of BetA on nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), a widely spread malignancy in the world, especially in East Asia. In this study, we first showed that BetA can effectively kill CNE2 cells, a cell line derived from NPC. BetA-induced CNE2 apoptosis was characterized by typical apoptosis hallmarks: caspase activation, DNA fragmentation, and cytochrome c release. Overexpression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL could partially prevent apoptosis caused by BetA. Moreover, Bax was not activated during the induction of apoptosis. Bax/Bak knockdown and wild-type CNE2 cells showed the same kinetics of cytochrome c release.

Patients and methods:   Of 436 patients, 218 patients were assigned to the test group and 218 patients to the validation group. Eight potential prognostic factors (age, performance status, number of involved vertebrae, ambulatory status, other bone metastases, visceral metastases, interval from cancer diagnosis to radiotherapy of MSCC, time developing motor deficits) plus the fractionation regimen were retrospectively investigated for associations with survival. Factors significant in the multivariate analysis were included in the survival score. The score for each significant prognostic factor was determined by dividing the 6-month survival rate (%) by 10. The total score represented the sum of the scores for each factor. The prognostic groups of the test group were compared to the validation group.  Results:   In the multivariate analysis of the test group, performance status, ambulatory status, other bone metastases, visceral metastases, and interval from cancer diagnosis to radiotherapy were significantly associated with survival. Total scores including these factors were 20, 21, 22, 24, 26, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 35, 37, or 39 points. In the test group, the 6-month survival rates were 6.5% for 20-24 points, 44.6% for 26-33 points, and 95.8% for 35-39 points (p < 0.0001). In the validation group, the 6-month survival rates were 7.4%, 45.4%, and 94.7%, respectively (p < 0.0001).

The strive to achieve similar oncological and functional results to this gold standard open procedure but with further reduction of morbidity through a minimally invasive access led to the establishment of laparoscopic prostatectomy. However, this procedure is complex and difficult and is associated with a long learning curve. The technical advantages of robotically assisted surgery coupled with the intuitive handling of the device led to increased precision and shortening of the learning curve. These main advantages, together with a massive internet presence and aggressive marketing, have resulted in a rapid dissemination of robotic radical prostatectomy and an increasing patient demand. However, superiority of robotic radical prostatectomy in comparison to the other surgical therapeutic options has not yet been proven on a scientific basis.

The functional variant (-1304T>G) in the MKK4 promoter has been implicated as a risk factor for many types of cancer. However, its role in prostate cancer (PCa) is unclear. To determine whether this SNP constitutes a risk factor for PCa susceptibility and to derive a more precise estimation of the associations between this SNP and cancer risk, we performed a case-control study and then a meta-analysis covering previous case-control studies.  Methods:   In this study, 222 male patients with PCa and 244 cancer-free controls were evaluated MKK4-1304T>G genotype. The transcriptional activity of MKK4 gene was measured by luciferase assay, and MKK4 serum expression was measured by ELISA.  Results:   As a whole, we found that compared to the most common -1304TT genotype, carriers of -1304G variant genotypes had a decreased risk of PCa (OR = 0.670; 95 % CI = 0.452-0.993, P = 0.046 for TG, and OR = 0.647; 95 % CI = 0.441-0.948, P = 0.025 for TG + GG). We found that carriers of the -1304G variant genotypes had greater transcriptional activity and serum expression of MKK4 than carriers of the -1304T allele. Our meta-analysis also suggested that the -1304G variant contributes to decreased risk of various cancers.  Conclusion:   Our results suggest that the functional -1304G variant in the MKK4 promoter decreases the risk of PCa by increasing the promoter activity.

Methods:   Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data from 90 patients (55 men, 35 women) with VM between 2004 and 2006. For each patient, data on the primary tumor (PT), date of diagnosis, TS at the time of VM diagnosis and date of death were retrieved from the electronic medical records and civil registry. True survival time and TS survival time were estimated to calculate the accuracy rate of the TS. A Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to study the survival function by prognostic groups. A correlation study between survival time and other variables was performed.  Results:   PT distribution was as follows: breast (22.2 %), lung (20 %), prostate (17.8 %), rectum (10 %), unknown (11 %), and others (18 %). Average overall survival after the VM diagnosis was 11.8 months (SD, 11 m): breast, 20 months (SD, 20 m); lung, 5.8 months (SD, 5.9 m); prostate, 14.5 months (SD, 13.4 m); rectum, 9.4 months (SD, 9.3); and unknown tumors, 2.7 months (SD, 5 m). Survival time was accurately predicted with the TS in 63 % of patients with a short life expectancy (survival, <6 months; TS, 0-8), 16 % of patients in the intermediate group (survival, 6-12 months; TS, 9-11), and 77 % of patients with a good prognosis (survival >12 months; TS, 12-15). By specific PT, the accuracy rate of the TS was low for breast cancer metastasis (35 %). The Kaplan-Meier curves show a significant separation among the prognostic groups (p < 0.05), but the log-rank test showed a statistically significant difference in survival only between short expectancy group and good prognostic group. Age at PT diagnosis and at VM diagnosis negatively correlated with survival (r = 0.22; p = 0.032 and r = 0.3, p = 0.04).  Conclusions:   The TS was not highly accurate for predicting survival in patients with VM, treated or not surgically, and it was particularly imprecise in patients with an intermediate score (9-11 points) and those with breast cancer, so it is possible that the TS currently has a poor external validity.""","""['Alberto Hernandez-Fernandez', 'Roberto Vélez', 'Ana Lersundi-Artamendi', 'Ferrán Pellisé']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""J Cancer Res Clin Oncol""","""['Tokuhashi score and other prognostic factors in 260 patients with surgery for vertebral metastases.', 'Predictive value of three surgical scoring systems for estimation of life expectancy in patients with extradural spinal metastasis.', 'Accuracy of Tokuhashi score system in predicting survival of lung cancer patients with vertebral metastasis.', 'Tokuhashi score is predictive of survival in a cohort of patients undergoing surgery for renal cell carcinoma spinal metastases.', 'The Tokuhashi score: effectiveness and pitfalls.', 'Artificial Intelligence and Predictive Modeling in Spinal Oncology: A Narrative Review.', 'Prognostic Factors for Bone Survival and Functional Outcomes in Patients With Breast Cancer Spine Metastases.', 'Prognostic Scoring System Development for Malignant Spinal Cord Compression.', 'Classification and scoring systems for metastatic spine tumors: a literature review.', 'The Role of Prognostic Scoring Systems in Assessing Surgical Candidacy for Patients With Vertebral Metastasis: A Narrative Review.']"""

Osteonectin/SPARC/BM-40 is a collagen binding matricellular protein that is enriched in bone. Its expression is increased in prostate cancer metastases, and it stimulates the migration of prostate carcinoma cells. However, the presence of osteonectin in cancer cells and the stroma may limit prostate tumor development and progression. To determine how bone matrix osteonectin affects the behavior of prostate cancer cells, we modeled prostate cancer cell-bone interactions using the human prostate cancer cell line PC-3, and mineralized matrices synthesized by wild type and osteonectin-null osteoblasts in vitro. We developed this in vitro system because the structural complexity of collagen matrices in vivo is not mimicked by reconstituted collagen scaffolds or by more complex substrates, like basement membrane extracts. Second harmonic generation imaging demonstrated that the wild type matrices had thick collagen fibers organized into longitudinal bundles, whereas osteonectin-null matrices had thinner fibers in random networks. Importantly, a mouse model of prostate cancer metastases to bone showed a collagen fiber phenotype similar to the wild type matrix synthesized in vitro. When PC-3 cells were grown on the wild type matrices, they displayed decreased cell proliferation, increased cell spreading, and decreased resistance to radiation-induced cell death, compared to cells grown on osteonectin-null matrix. Our data support the idea that osteonectin can suppress prostate cancer pathogenesis, expanding this concept to the microenvironment of skeletal metastases.""","""['Kristina Kapinas', 'Katie M Lowther', 'Catherine B Kessler', 'Karissa Tilbury', 'Jay R Lieberman', 'Jennifer S Tirnauer', 'Paul Campagnola', 'Anne M Delany']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Matrix Biol""","""['Mineralized human primary osteoblast matrices as a model system to analyse interactions of prostate cancer cells with the bone microenvironment.', 'Secreted Protein Acidic and Rich in Cysteine (SPARC) Mediates Metastatic Dormancy of Prostate Cancer in Bone.', 'Valproate reduces collagen and osteonectin in cultured bone cells.', 'SPARC/osteonectin in mineralized tissue.', 'Molecular insights into prostate cancer progression: the missing link of tumor microenvironment.', 'Data-Independent Acquisition Mass Spectrometry of EPS-Urine Coupled to Machine Learning: A Predictive Model for Prostate Cancer.', 'Adaptive and non-adaptive gene expression responses in prostate cancer during androgen deprivation.', 'The interplay between physical cues and mechanosensitive ion channels in cancer metastasis.', 'Castration-Induced Downregulation of SPARC in Stromal Cells Drives Neuroendocrine Differentiation of Prostate Cancer.', 'Exercise-induced myokines and their effect on prostate cancer.']"""

Although patients with serrated polyposis are known to be at increased risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) and possibly extracolonic cancers, cancer risk for their relatives has not been widely explored. The aim of this study was to estimate the risks of CRC and extracolonic cancers for relatives of patients with serrated polyposis.  Methods:   A cohort of the 1,639 first- and second-degree relatives of 100 index patients with serrated polyposis recruited regardless of a family history of polyps or cancer from genetic clinics in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and the USA, were retrospectively analyzed to estimate the country-, age-, and sex-specific standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) for relatives compared with the general population.  Results:   A total of 102 CRCs were observed in first- and second-relatives (SIR 2.25, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.75-2.93; P<0.001), with 54 in first-degree relatives (SIR 5.16, 95% CI 3.70-7.30; P<0.001) and 48 in second-degree relatives (SIR 1.38, 95% CI 1.01-1.91; P=0.04). Six pancreatic cancers were observed in first-degree relatives (SIR 3.64, 95% CI 1.70-9.21; P=0.003).

This study attempts to validate the stochastic model, relating absorbed dose to the emission and processing of cell death signals by non-irradiated cells, in vitro in PC3 human prostate cancer cell line.  Methods:   The recipient cell survival was measured after exposure of cells to ICMM derived from donor cells: a) exposed to radiation doses from 2 Gy to 8 Gy and b) of concentrations varying from 2 × 10(2) to 6 × 10(6) irradiated with 2 Gy.  Results:   Exposure to ICCM, irradiated with doses between 2-8 Gy, resulted in a significant (p < 0.001) decrease in clonogenic survival of non-irradiated recipient cells compared to the control group. However, dose dependency above 2 Gy was not observed, indicating that any dose threshold was below 2 Gy. A significant (p < 0.001) decrease in survival was found in recipient cells exposed to the ICCM, derived from different concentrations of donor cells exposed to 2 Gy, compared to the control group. The recipient cell survival following exposure to ICCM derived from 2 × 10(2) cells was significantly higher (p < 0.5) compared to the rest of donor cell concentrations, indicating that the toxicity of ICCM depends on the cellular concentration of donor cells. Non-linear regression data fitting provided reasonable agreement with the microdosimetric model for the induction of cell killing through medium-borne signals.

Understanding the molecular basis of prostate cancer progression can serve as a tool for early diagnosis and development of novel treatment strategies for this disease. Protein Kinase D1 (PKD1) is a multifunctional kinase that is highly expressed in normal prostate. The decreased expression of PKD1 has been associated with the progression of prostate cancer. Therefore, synthetic or natural products that regulate this signaling pathway can serve as novel therapeutic modalities for prostate cancer prevention and treatment. Curcumin, the active ingredient of turmeric, has shown anti-cancer properties via modulation of a number of different molecular pathways. Herein, we have demonstrated that curcumin activates PKD1, resulting in changes in β-catenin signaling by inhibiting nuclear β-catenin transcription activity and enhancing the levels of membrane β-catenin in prostate cancer cells. Modulation of these cellular events by curcumin correlated with decreased cell proliferation, colony formation and cell motility and enhanced cell-cell aggregation in prostate cancer cells. In addition, we have also revealed that inhibition of cell motility by curcumin is mediated by decreasing the levels of active cofilin, a downstream target of PKD1. The potent anti-cancer effects of curcumin in vitro were also reflected in a prostate cancer xenograft mouse model. The in vivo inhibition of tumor growth also correlated with enhanced membrane localization of β-catenin.

One of the major challenges in the present era is to design drugs that can specifically target tumor cells not normal cells. In this context, tumor homing peptides have drawn much attention. These peptides are playing a vital role in delivering drugs in tumor tissues with high specificity. In order to provide service to scientific community, we have developed a database of tumor homing peptides called TumorHoPe.  Description:   TumorHoPe is a manually curated database of experimentally validated tumor homing peptides that specifically recognize tumor cells and tumor associated microenvironment, i.e., angiogenesis. These peptides were collected and compiled from published papers, patents and databases. Current release of TumorHoPe contains 744 peptides. Each entry provides comprehensive information of a peptide that includes its sequence, target tumor, target cell, techniques of identification, peptide receptor, etc. In addition, we have derived various types of information from these peptide sequences that include secondary/tertiary structure, amino acid composition, and physicochemical properties of peptides. Peptides in this database have been found to target different types of tumors that include breast, lung, prostate, melanoma, colon, etc. These peptides have some common motifs including RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp) and NGR (Asn-Gly-Arg) motifs, which specifically recognize tumor angiogenic markers. TumorHoPe has been integrated with many web-based tools like simple/complex search, database browsing and peptide mapping. These tools allow a user to search tumor homing peptides based on their amino acid composition, charge, polarity, hydrophobicity, etc.  Conclusion:   TumorHoPe is a unique database of its kind, which provides comprehensive information about experimentally validated tumor homing peptides and their target cells. This database will be very useful in designing peptide-based drugs and drug-delivery system.

The molecular mechanism of SRY action in testis determination is, however, poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrate that WDR5, which encodes a WD-40 repeat protein, is a direct target of SRY. EMSA experiments and ChIP assays showed that SRY could bind to the WDR5 gene promoter directly. Overexpression of SRY in LNCaP cells significantly increased WDR5 expression concurrent with histone H3K4 methylation on the WDR5 promoter. To specifically address whether SRY contributes to WDR5 regulation, we introduced a 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen-inducible SRY allele into LNCaP cells. Conditional SRY expression triggered enrichment of SRY on the WDR5 promoter resulting in induction of WDR5 transcription. We found that WDR5 was self regulating through a positive feedback loop. WDR5 and SRY interacted and were colocalized in cells. In addition, the interaction of WDR5 with SRY resulted in activation of Sox9 while repressing the expression of β-catenin.

The number of prostate cancer deaths was obtained from the World Health Organization mortality database. We also used population estimates for Croatia from the Population Division of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs of the United Nations. Age standardized incidence and mortality rates were calculated by the direct standardization method. To describe time trends of incidence and mortality, joinpoint regression analysis was used.  Results:   Average age-standardized incidence rate between the first and last five-year period doubled, from 19.0/100,000 in 1988-1992 to 39.1 per 100,000 in 2004-2008. Age-standardized mortality rate increased by 6.9%, from 14.5 to 15.5 per 100,000. Joinpoint analysis of incidence identified two joinpoints. The increasing incidence trend started from 1997, with the estimated annual percent of change (EAPC) of 12.9% from 1997-2002 and of 4.1% from 2002-2008. Joinpoint analyses of mortality identified one joinpoint. Mortality trend first decreased, with EAPC of -3.0% from 1988-1995 to increase later with EAPC of 2.0% from 1995-2008.

The Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) plays an important role in the local staging of prostate cancer, although its use in clinical practice is widely debated. Therefore, the purpose of our study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of T2-weighted MR imaging in association with DCE-MRI, performed using an endorectal coil, in preoperative local staging of patients with prostate cancer, by using the histopathologic findings as the reference standard.  Materials and methods:   From April 2010 to May 2011, 65 patients (mean age, 65 years; range, 51-77 years) with clinical localized PCa, underwent radical prostatectomy at our institution, performed by 2 experienced surgeons. All patients were prospectively evaluated with eMRI in association with DCE-MRI prior to radical prostatectomy. In all patients MRI was performed at least 6 weeks after biopsy and within 2 weeks before Radical Prostatectomy (RP). Histologic analysis was our diagnostic ""gold standard"". To ensure that the histopathological findings matched with MR images, the assessment of radiological images and the RP specimens were performed dividing the prostate in 14 regions.  Results:   First, we performed a ""per-patient"" analysis, considering the entire prostate as a single region. Then, we performed a ""per-emigland"" analysis, finally a ""per-region"" analysis. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV and AUC in predicting ECE in the analysis ""per-emigland"" were respectively 66.7, 95.7, 66.7, 95.7, 0.824. The evaluation of SVI reported similar results: 62.5, 97.5, 62.5, 97.5, 0.797. DCE-MRI did not improve the diagnostic accuracy of T1-T2-weighted MR images in the evaluation of ECE or SVI.

The objective of this study was to specifically analyze the respiratory-induced prostate motion using a four-dimensional CT scan (4DCT).  Materials and methods:   Ten patients have been treated for prostate cancer in the supine position and with three implanted gold markers; they underwent a 4DCT using a GE LightSpeed16 CT scan (slice thickness 2.5mm). This acquisition was divided into 10 phases over the respiratory cycle using the Advantage4D software. For each phase, digitally-reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) were created at 0° and 90° with the view of the markers. The coordinates of each marker center were generated from the scan isocenter. The motion amplitude was: visually analyzed on the dynamic 4DCT sequences and then more precisely calculated by comparing the marker coordinates on the 10 scans.  Results:   There was not any difficulty in defining the coordinates of the markers on each series. No prostate motion was observed on a simple visual analysis of the dynamic 4DCT sequences. After a more specific analysis, using the coordinates of the fiducials on the 10 phases, the prostate motion remained below 1mm in all directions, except for the cranio-caudal, where it was undetectable (thereby below the slice thickness of 2.5mm).  Conclusions:   To our knowledge, this is the first study that evaluates the respiratory-induced prostate motion, using a 4DCT scan. Even if important prostate displacement can occur during the prostate treatment, because of the bladder or rectum filling, in the present study no respiratory-induced prostate motion was observed.""","""['Corina Udrescu', 'Patrice Jalade', 'Berardino de Bari', 'Géraldine Michel-Amadry', 'Olivier Chapet']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Radiother Oncol""","""['The influence of respiratory motion on CT image volume definition.', 'Dosimetric effects of the prone and supine positions on image guided localized prostate cancer radiotherapy.', 'Target localization accuracy in a respiratory phantom using BrainLAB ExacTrac and 4DCT imaging.', 'A randomized trial of supine vs. prone positioning in patients undergoing escalated dose conformal radiotherapy for prostate cancer.', 'Four-dimensional computed tomography: musculoskeletal applications.', 'GI factors, potential to predict prostate motion during radiotherapy; a scoping review.', 'Clinical applicability of deep learning-based respiratory signal prediction models for four-dimensional radiation therapy.', 'SBRT and extreme hypofractionation: A new era in prostate cancer treatments?', 'Respiratory-induced prostate motion using wavelet decomposition of the real-time electromagnetic tracking signal.', 'Challenges in accurate registration of 3-D medical imaging and histopathology in primary prostate cancer.']"""

Methods:   Results concerning questionnaire-based scored late bleeding and faecal incontinence in 718 patients with a complete follow-up of 36 months were analysed, focusing on the impact of specific pre-radiotherapy abdominal/pelvic surgery procedures. Patients were accrued in the prospective study AIROPROS 0102. Different types of surgery (rectum-sigma resection, kidney resection, cholecystectomy or appendectomy) were considered as covariates together with a number of different parameters previously found to be predictive of late toxicity and including clinical as well as dosimetric parameters. Univariate (UVA) and multivariate (MVA) logistic analyses were carried out.  Results:   In total 69/718 patients were previously submitted to one or more surgical procedures, mostly cholecystectomy (n=21) and appendectomy (n=27). Actuarial incidences of G2-G3 and G3 bleeding were 52 (7.2%) and 24 (3.3%) respectively; 19 (2.6%) chronic incontinence events were registered. Cholecystectomy was found to be highly correlated with late rectal bleeding at UVA: OR=4.3 and p=0.006 for G2-G3 and OR=5.4 and p=0.01 for G3. Considering MVA (including dosimetric and clinical factors), G2-G3 bleeding was significantly correlated to cholecystectomy (OR=6.5, p=0.002), V75 Gy (OR=1.074, p=0.003) and secondarily with appendectomy (OR=2.7, p=0.10), presence of acute radioinduced rectal bleeding (OR=1.70, p=0.21) and androgen deprivation (OR=0.67, p=0.25). Appendectomy (OR=5.9, p=0.004) and cholecystectomy (OR=5.5, p=0.016) were very strong predictors of G3 bleeding with V75 Gy playing a less significant role (OR=1.037, p=0.26). Conversely, no specific surgery was correlated with actuarial or chronic incontinence.  Conclusions:   This analysis highlights previous SURG as the best predictor of late rectal bleeding.

The aim of this study is to analyze the relationship between these parameters and their influence on the quality of treatment plans and beam-on time.  Material and methods:   Ten prostate cancer patients were included in the study. For each patient, two cases of irradiation were considered depending on the target volume: PTV1 included the prostate gland, seminal vesicles, pelvic lymph nodes and a 1 cm margin, whereas PTV2 included only the prostate gland with a 1 cm margin. For each patient and each case of irradiation (PTV1 and PTV2) 8 treatment plans were created - all consisted of a different combination of planning parameters (FW = 1.05, 2.5, 5 cm; PF = 0.107, 0.215, 0.43; MF = 1.5, 2.5, 3.5). Default values used in this study were FW = 2.5 cm, PF = 0.215 and MF = 2.5. Hence, for plans with different FWs, parameters of PF and MF were 0.215 and 2.5, respectively; for different PFs, FW and MF were 2.5 and 2.5, respectively; finally for different MFs, FW and PF were 2.5 and 0.215, respectively. The reference plan was optimized for FW = 1.05 cm, PF = 0.107 and MF = 3.5, which was assumed to result in the best dose distribution and the longest treatment time. As a result, 160 plans were created. Each plan was analyzed for dose distribution and execution time.  Results and conclusion:   : Treatment plans with FW of 5 cm resulted in the shortest execution time compromising the dose distribution. Moreover, the dose fall off in the longitudinal direction was not sharp. FW of 1.05 cm and PF of 0.107 were not recommended for routine prostate plans due to long execution time, which was 3 times longer than for plans with FW = 5 cm. There was no substantial decrease of irradiation time when PF was increased from 0.215 to 0.43 for both cases (PTV1 and PTV2); however, the dose distribution was slightly compromised. Finally, decreasing MF from 2.5 to 1.5 was useless because it did not change the beam-on time; however, it did remarkably decrease the dose distribution. Nevertheless, increasing MF up to 3.5 could be considered. The lowest EUD for the rectum and intestines, could be observed for PF = 0.107. For the other plans the differences were rather small (the EUD was almost the same). By reducing PF from 0.43 to 0.107 or FW from 5 to 1.05 the EUD for bladder (in PTV1 case) decreased by 3.13% and 2.60%. When PTV2 was a target volume, the EUD for bladder decreased by 4.54% and 3.43% when FW was changed from 5 to 1.05 and MF from 1.5 to 3.5, respectively. For optimal balance between beam-on time and dose distribution in OARs for routine patients, the authors would suggest to use: FW = 2.5, PF = 0.215 and MF = 2.5.""","""['M Skórska', 'T Piotrowski']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Phys Med""","""['Evaluation of the dosimetric impact of non-exclusion of the rectum from the boost PTV in IMRT treatment plans for prostate cancer patients.', 'Simultaneous beam geometry and intensity map optimization in intensity-modulated radiation therapy.', 'Comparison of treatment planning parameters for dose painting head and neck plans delivered with tomotherapy.', 'Significant improvement in normal tissue sparing and target coverage for head and neck cancer by means of helical tomotherapy.', 'Treatment plan comparison between helical tomotherapy and MLC-based IMRT using radiobiological measures.', 'Impact of delivery time factor on treatment time and plan quality in tomotherapy.', 'Optimal Combination of Pitch, Modulation Factor and Dosimetric Considerations in Treatment Planning for Total Body Irradiation Using Helical Tomotherapy.', 'Comprehensive clinical evaluation of TomoEQA for patient-specific pre-treatment quality assurance in helical tomotherapy.', 'Parotid gland dose reduction in the hippocampus avoidance whole-brain radiotherapy using helical tomotherapy.', 'Influence of Modulation Factor on Treatment Plan Quality and Irradiation Time in Hippocampus-Sparing Whole-Brain Radiotherapy Using Tomotherapy.']"""

Median patient age was 66 yr (range: 54-88), baseline prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was 5.3 (range: 1.3-17.9), and four patients (40%) had clinical high-grade and high-stage disease.

Relevant intraoperative TRUS findings were relayed in real time to the robotic surgeon, particularly during dissection of the bladder neck and prostatic apex, during neurovascular bundle preservation, and when hypoechoic prostate lesions approximated nerve-preserving dissection. Negative margins were achieved in nine patients (90%), including cases where significant intraprostatic lesions abutted or extended through the prostate capsule. No complications occurred.

Elucidating the mechanisms of how cancer cells evade or delay apoptosis should lead to novel therapeutic strategies. Previously, we showed that HT-29 colorectal cancer cells undergoing apoptosis overexpressed cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), in a p38 dependent pathway, to delay ursolic acid-induced apoptosis. Here, we focused on elucidating the upstream signaling pathways regulating this resistance mechanism. The role of ATP as an extracellular signaling molecule took a long time to be accepted. In recent years, ATP and its analogs, via the activation of specific purinergic receptors, have been implicated in many biological processes including cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. In the present report, we have demonstrated a novel role involving purinergic receptors and particularly the P2Y(2) receptor in resistance to ursolic acid-induced apoptosis in both colorectal HT-29 and prostate DU145 cancer cells. We found that ursolic acid induced an increase in intracellular ATP and P2Y(2) transcript levels. Upon activation, P2Y(2) activated Src which in turn phosphorylated p38 leading to COX-2 overexpression which induced resistance to apoptosis in both HT-29 and DU145 cells. Furthermore, Ca(2+)-independent PLA(2) (iPLA(2)) and Ca(2+)-dependent secretory PLA(2) (sPLA(2)) were responsible for arachidonic acid release, the substrate of COX-2. Our findings document that apoptosis triggering was dependent on protein kinase C (PKC) activation in both cell lines after ursolic acid treatment.""","""['Youness Limami', 'Aline Pinon', 'David Yannick Leger', 'Emilie Pinault', 'Christiane Delage', 'Jean-Louis Beneytout', 'Alain Simon', 'Bertrand Liagre']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Biochimie""","""['Ursolic Acid against Prostate and Urogenital Cancers: A Review of In Vitro and In Vivo Studies.', 'HT-29 colorectal cancer cells undergoing apoptosis overexpress COX-2 to delay ursolic acid-induced cell death.', 'Changes in androgen receptor nongenotropic signaling correlate with transition of LNCaP cells to androgen independence.', 'Asiatic acid, a triterpene, induces apoptosis and cell cycle arrest through activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways in human breast cancer cells.', 'P2Y2 Receptor Functions in Cancer: A Perspective in the Context of Colorectal Cancer.', 'Ursolic Acid against Prostate and Urogenital Cancers: A Review of In Vitro and In Vivo Studies.', 'Colorectal Cancer and Purinergic Signalling: An Overview.', 'The P2 purinoceptors in prostate cancer.', 'Potentiating Cancer Immune Therapy via Nanomaterials and Purinergic Signaling.', 'An Extensive Pharmacological Evaluation of New Anti-Cancer Triterpenoid (Nummularic Acid) from Ipomoea batatas through In Vitro, In Silico, and In Vivo Studies.']"""

Results:   Prostate cancer standardized mortality rates increased 2.8%/year (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 2.1 to 3.6) between 1986 and 1998 and changed -3.1%/year (95% CI: -4.1 to -2.2) from 1998 to 2006. At a regional level there was a significant decline in Porto since 1992, and later on in Aveiro, Lisboa, Viana do Castelo and Viseu. The regional trends were inversely associated with the standardized mortality rates in each region at the beginning of the period (r=-0.67, p=0.003).  Conclusion:   An inflection in prostate cancer mortality was observed in Portugal in the late 1990s, with an estimated annual percent change of -3%/year from 1998 to 2006, and higher declines in the regions with the highest mortality rates at the beginning of the period.""","""['Joana Bastos', 'Francisco Botelho', 'Francisco Pina', 'Nuno Lunet']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Acta Med Port""","""['Breast cancer mortality trend in Portugal (1955-2002).', 'Prostate cancer incidence and mortality in Portugal: trends, projections and regional differences.', 'Interpreting trends in prostate cancer incidence and mortality in the five Nordic countries.', 'Trends in mortality from urologic cancers in Europe, 1970-2008.', 'Overview of Membrane Science and Technology in Portugal.']"""

Serum C-reactive protein (C-reactive protein) is emerging as a potential novel prognostic factor in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). In the present study, a prospective trial was investigated retrospectively and a significant prognostic impact for C-reactive protein that was independent of multiple published prognostic models was identified in men receiving docetaxel-based chemotherapy for mCRPC. Prospective validation is warranted.  Objective:   • Given the recent emergence of C-reactive protein levels as a novel prognostic factor in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), we sought to evaluate the independent prognostic ability of C-reactive protein in the context of published prognostic nomograms, risk grouping and disease state models in men receiving docetaxel-based chemotherapy for mCRPC.  Patients and methods:   • A large randomized phase II trial (CS-205) of mCRPC patients who received docetaxel-prednisone + AT-101 (Bcl-2 inhibitor) or docetaxel-prednisone + placebo was analyzed retrospectively (n= 220). • Overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS) and measures of discriminatory ability were assessed in a hypothesis-generating analysis using Cox regression and concordance probabilities. • Patients from both treatment groups were combined for this analysis because no significant differences in outcomes were observed. • Because some factors used in nomograms were not collected or defined differently, risk was estimated based on slightly modified versions of nomograms.  Results:   • C-reactive protein was independently prognostic for OS and PFS (P ≤ 0.002) after adjusting for all modeled risk estimates and classifiers. • C-reactive protein showed a concordance probability of 0.65 for both OS and PFS. • A 10-factor modified prognostic model based on the TAX327 trial had the greatest observed discrimination ability for OS and PFS (concordance probability = 0.623 and 0.603, respectively) among the modified nomograms or classifiers. • Adding the TAX327 model risk estimates to C-reactive protein did not substantially increase discrimination ability over C-reactive protein alone.  Conclusions:   • Current prognostic classifications provide modest discrimination of outcomes in mCRPC receiving docetaxel-based chemotherapy, highlighting the need for improved risk-based models. • Baseline C-reactive protein appears to be an useful, independent prognostic factor and prospective external validation is warranted.""","""['Gregory R Pond', 'Andrew J Armstrong', 'Brian A Wood', 'Lance Leopold', 'Matthew D Galsky', 'Guru Sonpavde']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['C-reactive protein as a prognostic marker FOR mCRPC.', 'Rational indication for docetaxel rechallenge in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'The development of risk groups in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer based on risk factors for PSA decline and survival.', 'Efficacy of docetaxel-based chemotherapy following ketoconazole in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: implications for prior therapy in clinical trials.', 'Chemotherapy-based treatment for castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Optimizing the use of docetaxel in men with castration-resistant metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Serum biomarkers of inflammation for diagnosis of prostate cancer in patients with nonspecific elevations of serum prostate specific antigen levels.', 'Efficiency of C-reactive protein in prognosis evaluation of prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'C-Reactive Protein Is a Poor Marker of Baseline Inflammation in Prostate Cancer and Response to Radiotherapy or Androgen Ablation.', 'A systematic review of the overlap of fluid biomarkers in delirium and advanced cancer-related syndromes.', 'The Pretherapeutic Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio for Docetaxel-Based Chemotherapy Is Useful for Predicting the Prognosis of Japanese Patients with Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.']"""

What's known on the subject? and What does the study add? Different tools allow the individual estimation of the various endpoints in patients with prostate cancer. The Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment (CAPRA) score is an easy to calculate prediction tool, based on a large population based database. However, little is known about the performance of this prediction tool in European patients. The data obtained in the present study demonstrate differences in tumour characteristics between European patients and the initial development cohort from the USA. However, the concordance index of the CAPRA scores for predicting biochemical recurrence and metastatic recurrence was 76.2 and 78.5, respectively, in European patients. Therefore, the CAPRA score also allows reliable prediction of the examined endpoints in European patients.  Objectives:   • To assess the ability of the Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment Score (CAPRA) score for predicting biochemical recurrence (BCR) and metastatic recurrence (MR) by using a large cohort of European patients with prostate cancer. • The CAPRA score was initially developed using patients treated in community-based hospitals in the USA and allows a prediction of the risk of different clinical endpoints, without incorporating the surgical margin status.  Patients and methods:   • BCR and metastatic recurrence rates were studied in 2937 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy in a tertiary referral centre after a mean (median, range) follow-up of 49 (56, 12-220) months. • The association between the examined endpoints, individual CAPRA scores and pathological features was analyzed by using Kaplan-Meier, proportional hazard and logistic regressions analyses. • Graphical representation assessed the calibration of the CAPRA score for predicting both endpoints.  Results:   • Compared to the initial development cohort, worse tumour characteristics and a lower overall positive surgical margin rate (17.2% vs 32.4%) were detected in the European cohort. • Overall, 530 (18.4%) and 58 (1.9%) of patients developed BCR and MR. Increasing CAPRA scores were related to less favourable pathological characteristics and higher BCR and metastatic recurrence rates. • For example, the 5-year BCR and metastatic recurrence rates were markedly different at the extremes of 0-1 vs ≥ 8 (9.2% vs 70.8% and 0.7% vs 16.4%, respectively). • The concordance index for the prediction of BCR and metastatic recurrence was 76.2 and 78.5, respectively.  Conclusions:   • Despite differences between the present cohort and the initial development cohort with respect to clinical features and the outcomes achieved, the data obtained in the present study shows the generalizability of the CAPRA score. • Specifically, the data allow the precise identification of those European patients who are at high risk for BCR and MR.""","""['Lars Budäus', 'Hendrik Isbarn', 'Pierre Tennstedt', 'Georg Salomon', 'Thorsten Schlomm', 'Thomas Steuber', 'Alexander Haese', 'Felix Chun', 'Margit Fisch', 'Uwe Michl', 'Hans Heinzer', 'Hartwig Huland', 'Markus Graefen']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Comparative analysis of three risk assessment tools in Australian patients with prostate cancer.', 'Validity of the CAPRA score to predict biochemical recurrence-free survival after radical prostatectomy.

Methods and materials:   Sixty-five candidates for salvage radiation therapy were referred for an MRL to determine their lymph node status. Clinical and histopathologic features were recorded. For 49 patients, data were complete to calculate the Stephenson nomogram score. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed to determine how well this nomogram related to the MRL result.

Results:   MRL detected positive lymph nodes in 47 patients. ROC analysis for the Stephenson nomogram yielded an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.78 (95% confidence interval, 0.61-0.93). Of 29 patients with a PSA <1.0 ng/mL, 18 had a positive MRL. Of 37 patients without lymph node involvement at initial lymph node dissection, 25 had a positive MRL. ROC analysis for the Stephenson nomogram showed AUCs of 0.84 and 0.74, respectively, for these latter groups.  Conclusion:   MRL detected positive lymph nodes in 72% of candidates for salvage radiation therapy, in 62% of candidates for early salvage radiation therapy, and in 68% of initially node-negative patients.

In this study correlations between the 3D dose distribution to the anal-sphincter region and radiation-induced side-effects were quantified.  Materials and methods:   Dose-surface maps of the anal canal were generated. Next, longitudinal and lateral extent and eccentricity were calculated at different dose levels; DSHs and DVHs were also determined. Correlations between these dosimetric measures and seven clinically relevant endpoints were determined by assessing dosimetric constraints. Furthermore, an LKB model was generated. The study was performed using the data of 388 prostate patients from the RT01 trial (ISRCTN 47772397).  Results:   Subjective sphincter control was significantly correlated with the dose to the anal surface. The strongest correlations were found for lateral extent at 53 Gy (p=0.01).

What's known on the subject? and What does the study add? The role of the vacuum erection device (VED) has increased with its use in combined therapy with a phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor (PDE5i) for penile rehabilitation after radical prostatectomy (RP) and radiotherapy. The advantages of the VED are non-invasive, cost-effective, and a possibility of preventing shrinkage of penis length. Albeit current widespread use of penile rehabilitation programmes for post-RP erectile dysfunction, independent predictors for the rehabilitation participants, as well as for its treatment success have not been fully investigated. In the present study, we have added several new predictors for rehabilitation participation, e.g. African-Americans and higher preoperative sexual function. Conversely, higher preoperative PSA concentrations and the presence of positive surgical margins were predictors for avoidance of rehabilitation. Notably, there was a primary surgeon difference, which had a trend for predicting outcome of the rehabilitation among the participants, implying their surgical technique and follow-up might influence success of the rehabilitation.  Objectives:   • To investigate baseline demographic and clinicopathological characteristics of men who participate in our penile rehabilitation programme after radical prostatectomy (RP). • To determine predictors for participation in rehabilitation, as well as successful rehabilitation outcome using multivariable logistic regression analyses.  Patients and methods:   • We analysed data on 2345 consecutive patients who underwent RP between 2001 and 2009 in our institution. • The decision to participate in penile rehabilitation using phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor (PDE5i) with a vacuum erection device (VED) was based on the patient's choice after post-RP discussions. • Rehabilitation success was defined using the following criteria: (i) patients who continued the penile rehabilitation programme and did not switch treatment from PDE5i to other erectile aids, (ii) success was noted in men who had an Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) sexual function (SF) score of >75% of the patient's baseline EPIC score, and (iii) patients who answered that they achieved adequate erections with a PDE5i. • Logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with treatment participation and its success.  Results:   • Of 676 patients, 354 (53.2%) men participated in a penile rehabilitation programme. Among 329 rehabilitation participants with available data, 96 (29.2%) had treatment success. • In multivariable regression analysis, African-Americans (odds ratio [OR] 3.47, P < 0.001), and higher preoperative SF (OR 1.02, P < 0.001) were associated with participation in rehabilitation. • Higher preoperative PSA concentration (OR 0.50, P = 0.004) and presence of positive surgical margins (OR 0.68, P = 0.042) were found to be independent predictors for non-participation in the rehabilitation. • For rehabilitation outcomes, being older at surgery (OR 0.93, P = 0.001) and adjuvant therapy (OR 0.34, P = 0.047) had a negative association with successful outcome. • There was a trend in the relationship between primary surgeon and rehabilitation success (OR 1.05, P = 0.053)  Conclusions:   • Those patients who have risk factors, e.g. adverse prostate cancer features, need to be carefully counselled and encouraged to participate in the penile rehabilitation programme. • Clinicians could lead patients toward successful outcomes if appropriate surgical techniques and rehabilitation are provided.""","""['Masaki Kimura', 'Jorge R Caso', 'Lionel L Bañez', 'Bridget F Koontz', 'Leah Gerber', 'Cagri Senocak', 'Craig F Donatucci', 'Zeljko Vujaskovic', 'Judd W Moul', 'Thomas J Polascik']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Optimal strategy for penile rehabilitation after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy based on preoperative erectile function.', 'Erectile rehabilitation with intracavernous alprostadil after radical prostatectomy: refusal and dropout rates.', 'Penile rehabilitation following radical prostatectomy: predicting success.', 'Application of the vacuum erectile device in penile rehabilitation for erectile dysfunction after radical prostatectomy.', 'Optimization of sexual function outcome after radical prostatectomy using phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors.', 'Vacuum erection device for erectile function rehabilitation after radical prostatectomy: which is the correct schedule?

Material and methods:   A retrospective analysis of 110 consecutive radical prostatectomy cases operated on between 2000 and 2006 and worked up using large-format ""two-dimensional"" (2D; 4 μm thick) and ""three-dimensional"" (3D; 1500 μm thick) histology sections was carried out, with an average follow-up of 5.1 years. The same material was also analysed for selected biomarkers in tissue microarray blocks. The most discriminatory biomarkers were then tested on preoperative core biopsy specimens from 24 of these patients.  Results:   3D histology classified 97/110 (88%) cases of AAP and 13/110 (12%) DAP, which was then confirmed in 2D specimens. The DAP cases had a significantly greater frequency of pT3a and more advanced cancers, > 20 mm tumour focus, high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, Gleason score ≥ 7, positive margin, extracapsular extension, vascular invasion, seminal vesicle infiltration, biochemical/local recurrence, regional lymph-node metastases and distant metastases. Three biomarkers in combination (chromogranin A, epidermal growth factor receptor and p53] distinguished DAP from AAP with an accuracy of 94% (area under the curve 0.94, 95% confidence interval 0.88-0.99). The same high accuracy was achieved using these three biomarkers on the preoperative specimens.  Conclusions:   Both 3D histology and the three selected biomarkers can help in accurately distinguishing DAP from AAP. The clear-cut distinction of two forms of prostate cancers by the approach advocated in this paper would allow AAP patients to undergo less radical treatment and would segregate DAP patients into a subset requiring more effective treatment regimens.""","""['Miklós Tarján', 'Hsiu-Hsi Chen', 'Tibor Tot', 'Wendy Wu', 'Anna Lenngren', 'Peter B Dean', 'László Tabár']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Scand J Urol Nephrol""","""['Diagnostic problems and prognostic factors in prostate cancer.', 'Immunohistochemical verification of ductal differentiation in prostate cancer.', 'High-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasialike ductal adenocarcinoma of the prostate: a clinicopathologic study of 28 cases.', 'Small cell-like change in prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, intraductal carcinoma, and invasive prostatic carcinoma: a study of 7 cases.', 'Intraductal Carcinoma of the Prostate Gland: Recent Advances.', 'Ductal adenocarcinoma of the prostate: A systematic review and meta-analysis of incidence, presentation, prognosis, and management.', 'Optimizing the diagnosis and management of ductal prostate cancer.', 'Immunohistochemical profile of ductal adenocarcinoma of the prostate.', 'A Proposal to Unify the Classification of Breast and Prostate Cancers Based on the Anatomic Site of Cancer Origin and on Long-term Patient Outcome.']"""

Increased expression of Prostate Stem Cell Antigen (PSCA) is correlated with development of malignant human prostate cancer, while studies in mouse models suggest that decreased PSCA levels promote prostate cancer metastasis. These studies suggest that PSCA has context-dependent functions, and could be differentially regulated during tumor progression. In the present study, we identified the multi-functional transcription factor Yin Yang 1 (YY1) as a modulator of PSCA expression in prostate epithelial cell lines. Increased YY1 levels are observed in prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) and advanced disease. We show that androgen-mediated up-regulation of PSCA in prostate epithelial cell lines is dependent on YY1. We identified two direct YY1 binding sites within the PSCA promoter, and showed that the upstream site inhibited, while the downstream site, proximal to the androgen-responsive element, stimulated PSCA promoter activity. Thus, changes in PSCA expression levels in prostate cancer may at least partly be affected by cellular levels of YY1. Our results also suggest multiple roles for YY1 in prostate cancer which may contribute to disease progression by modulation of genes such as PSCA.""","""['Shuai Tang', 'Meenu Mishra', 'Donna P Frazier', 'Miranda L Moore', 'Kazushi Inoue', 'Rajendar Deora', 'Guangchao Sui', 'Purnima Dubey']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['rs2294008T, a risk allele for gastric and gallbladder cancers, suppresses the PSCA promoter by recruiting the transcription factor YY1.', 'Yin Yang 1 regulates the transcriptional activity of androgen receptor.', 'Yin Yang 1 intronic binding sequences and splicing elicit intron-mediated enhancement of ubiquitin C gene expression.', 'Prostate stem cell antigen: a Jekyll and Hyde molecule?', 'Prostate stem cell antigen and cancer risk, mechanisms and therapeutic implications.', 'Novel Redirected T-Cell Immunotherapies for Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'Functional interplay between YY1 and CARM1 promotes oral carcinogenesis.', 'Prostate-specific markers to identify rare prostate cancer cells in liquid biopsies.', 'miRNA-584-3p inhibits gastric cancer progression by repressing Yin Yang 1- facilitated MMP-14 expression.', 'Aberrant expression of cyclin D1 in cancer.']"""

Purpose:   To evaluate the accuracy of MRI with an endorectal surface coil for staging primary endometrial carcinoma.  Material and methods:   A total of 33 consecutive patients with biopsy-proven endometrial cancer underwent 1.5T MRI with an endorectal surface coil (eMRI) using sagittal and axial T2-weighted (T2w) turbo spin echo (TSE), axial T1 gradient echo 2D fat-saturated (fs), sagittal T1 gradient echo 3D with and without contrast enhancement (CE), and axial T1 TSE fs CE sequence. Evaluation of local tumor extension was based on the revised standard TNM classification for endometrial cancer. eMRI staging was compared with the histopathological results after surgery.  Results:   A total of 33 consecutive patients underwent eMRI for staging endometrial cancer, and 21 of these underwent primary surgery. The histological stages were as follows: T1a (n = 8), T1b (n = 10), T2b (n = 2), and T3a (n = 1). Overall staging accuracy by eMRI was 71% (15 of 21). With regard to depth of myometrial invasion, eMRI correctly diagnosed stage T1a in 75% (6/8) and stage T1b in 80% (8/10). eMRI overstaged the tumor in four patients and understaged it in two.  Conclusion:   eMRI is highly accurate in staging myometrial invasion. However, eMRI at 1.5T does not seem to be significantly more accurate than pelvic MRI without an endorectal coil at 1.5T for staging primary endometrial cancer. eMRI for endometrial carcinoma therefore might not meet expectations compared with the results obtained using eMRI for staging prostate cancer at 1.5T.""","""['Céline D Alt', 'Kerstin A Brocker', 'Michael Eichbaum', 'Christof Sohn', 'Annette Kopp-Schneider', 'Hans-Ulrich Kauczor', 'Peter Hallscheidt']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Acta Radiol""","""['Endometrial cancer: results of clinical and histopathological staging compared to magnetic resonance imaging using an endorectal surface coil.', 'Endoscopic ultrasound and endorectal magnetic resonance imaging: a prospective, comparative study for preoperative staging and follow-up of rectal cancer.', 'Endorectal coil MRI in local staging of rectal cancer.', 'Endometrial cancer: magnetic resonance imaging.', 'Tumor staging and follow-up care in rectosigmoid carcinoma: colonoscopic endosonography compared to CT, MRI and endorectal MRI.', 'An endovaginal MRI array with a forward-looking coil for advanced gynecological cancer brachytherapy procedures: Design and initial results.']"""

All malignancies that had developed between 1966 and 2007 were recorded. Time-dependent Cox regression analyses were used to calculate the association between the development of cutaneous SCCs and IMs. The incidence of IMs in the KTRs after transplantation was also compared with the general Dutch population by calculating standardized morbidity ratios (SMRs) and was matched for age, sex, and time period in which the malignancy had occurred.

Application of this technique to two disparate sites, complex cranial tumors, and prostate was examined. HybridArc plans were compared with either dynamic conformal arc (DCA) or IMRT plans to determine whether HybridArc offers a synergy through combination of these 2 techniques. Plans were compared with regard to target volume dose conformity, target volume dose homogeneity, sparing of proximal organs at risk, normal tissue sparing, and monitor unit (MU) efficiency. For cranial cases, HybridArc produced significantly improved dose conformity compared with both DCA and IMRT but did not improve sparing of the brainstem or optic chiasm. For prostate cases, conformity was improved compared with DCA but not IMRT. Compared with IMRT, the dose homogeneity in the planning target volume was improved, and the maximum doses received by the bladder and rectum were reduced. Both arc-based techniques distribute peripheral dose over larger volumes of normal tissue compared with IMRT, whereas HybridArc involved slightly greater volumes of normal tissues compared with DCA. Compared with IMRT, cranial cases required 38% more MUs, whereas for prostate cases, MUs were reduced by 7%. For cranial cases, HybridArc improves dose conformity to the target.

The ExacTrac/Novalis Body X-ray 6-day image acquisition system (ET/NB; BrainLab AG, Feldkirchen, Germany) was used to determine and correct the target position. During the first period in 10 patients we recorded all rotation errors but used only Y (table) for correction. For the next 28 patients we used for correction all rotational coordinates, i.e., in addition Z (superior-inferior [SI] or roll) and X (left-right [LR] or tilt/pitch) according to the fiducial marker position by use of the Robotic Tilt Module and Varian Exact Couch. Rotation correction was applied above a threshold of 1° displacement. The systematic and random errors were specified. Overall, 993 software-assisted rotational corrections were performed. The interfraction rotation errors of the prostate as assessed from the radiodense surrogate markers around the three axes Y, Z, and X were on average 0.09, -0.52, and -0.01° with standard deviations of 2.01, 2.30, and 3.95°, respectively. The systematic uncertainty per patient for prostate rotation was estimated with 2.30, 1.56, and 4.13° and the mean random components with 1.81, 2.02, and 3.09°. The largest rotational errors occurred around the X-axis (pitch), but without preferring a certain orientation. Although the error around Z (roll) can be compensated on average by a transformation with 4 coordinates, a significant error around X remains and advocates the full correction with 6 coordinates. Rotational errors as assessed via daily stereoscopic online imaging are significant and dominate around X.

We aimed to examine the incidence, location, and extent of PSM as well as their impact on biochemical recurrence (BCR) following RPP.  Materials and methods:   A total of 794 patients underwent RPP by a single surgeon between June 1993 and August 2010. Covariates included age, pathologic T stage, pathologic Gleason sum, preoperative PSA, prostate volume, PSM extent, and location. Life table, Kaplan-Meier, and Cox regression analyses assessed predictors of BCR following RPP.  Results:   PSM were recorded in 162 patients (20.4%); of these, 83 (51.2%) were focal (≤ 1 mm) whereas 79 (48.8%) were broad (>1 mm). Location of PSM was anterior 10.5%, posterior or lateral 14.8%, bladder neck 23.5%, apical 32.1%, and multifocal 19.1%. At a median follow-up of 54 months, the 5-year BCR-free probability was 90.8% in patients with negative margins, 77.5% in patients with focal PSM, and 47.5% in patients with broad PSM.

Methods:   To identify new SNPs associated with PCa and CRC in the Polish population, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed using DNA sample pools on Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP 6.0 arrays. A total of 135 PCa patients and 270 healthy men (PCa sub-study) and 525 patients with adenoma (AD), 630 patients with CRC and 690 controls (AD/CRC sub-study) were included in the analysis. Allele frequency distributions were compared with t-tests and χ(2)-tests. Only those significantly associated SNPs with a proxy SNP (p<0.001; distance of 100 kb; r(2)>0.7) were selected. GWAS marker selection was conducted using PLINK. The study was replicated using extended cohorts of patients and controls. The association with previously reported PCa and CRC susceptibility variants was also examined. Individual patients were genotyped using TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assays.  Results:   The GWAS selected six and 24 new candidate SNPs associated with PCa and CRC susceptibility, respectively. In the replication study, 17 of these associations were confirmed as significant in additive model of inheritance. Seven of them remained significant after correction for multiple hypothesis testing. Additionally, 17 previously reported risk variants have been identified, five of which remained significant after correction.  Conclusion:   Pooled-DNA GWAS enabled the identification of new susceptibility loci for CRC in the Polish population.

Posttranslational modification of histone proteins is a major mechanism of epigenetic regulation. The kinase PRK1 (protein kinase C related kinase 1, also known as PKN1) phosphorylates histone H3 at threonine 11 and is involved in the regulation of androgen receptor signalling. Thus, it has been identified as a novel drug target but little is known about PRK1 inhibitors and consequences of its inhibition.  Methodology/principal finding:   Using a focused library screening approach, we identified the clinical candidate lestaurtinib (also known as CEP-701) as a new inhibitor of PRK1. Based on a generated 3D model of the PRK1 kinase using the homolog PKC-theta (protein kinase c theta) protein as a template, the key interaction of lestaurtinib with PRK1 was analyzed by means of molecular docking studies. Furthermore, the effects on histone H3 threonine phosphorylation and androgen-dependent gene expression was evaluated in prostate cancer cells.  Conclusions/significance:   Lestaurtinib inhibits PRK1 very potently in vitro and in vivo. Applied to cell culture it inhibits histone H3 threonine phosphorylation and androgen-dependent gene expression, a feature that has not been known yet.

However, recent clinical studies have shown an equivocal response to sunitinib in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer.

Our experiments showed that PTEN expression inversely correlates with sunitinib resistance in renal and prostate cancer cells.

Aberrant PKD expression and activity have been shown in multiple cancers, and novel PKD inhibitors show promising anticancer activities. Despite these advances, the mechanisms through which PKD contributes to the pathogenesis of cancer remain unknown. Here, we establish a novel role for PKD3, the least studied member of the PKD family, in the regulation of prostate cancer cell growth and motility through modulation of secreted tumor-promoting factors. Using both a stable inducible knockdown cell model and a transient knockdown system using multiple siRNAs, we show that silencing of endogenous PKD3 significantly reduces prostate cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. In addition, conditioned medium from PKD3-knockdown cells exhibits less migratory potential compared with that from control cells. Further analysis indicated that depletion of PKD3 blocks secretion of multiple key tumor-promoting factors including matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and GROα but does not alter mRNA transcript levels for these factors, implying impairment of the secretory pathway. More significantly, inducible depletion of PKD3 in a subcutaneous xenograft model suppresses tumor growth and decreases levels of intratumoral GROα in mice.

Although the bone metastasis of prostate cancer is characterized by increased ossification, the molecular mechanisms involved in this process are not fully understood. Here, the roles of bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) in the interactions between prostate cancer cells and bone stromal cells were investigated. In human prostate cancer LNCaP cells, BMP-4 induced the production of Sonic hedgehog (SHH) through a Smad-dependent pathway. In mouse stromal MC3T3-E1 cells, SHH up-regulated the expression of activin receptor IIB (ActR-IIB) and Smad1, which in turn enhanced BMP-responsive reporter activities in these cells. The combined stimulation with BMP-4 and SHH of MC3T3-E1 cells cooperatively induced the expression of osteoblastic markers, including alkaline phosphatase, bone sialoprotein, collagen type II α1, and osteocalcin. When MC3T3-E1 cells and LNCaP cells were co-cultured, the osteoblastic differentiation of MC3T3-E1 cells, which was induced by BMP-4, was accelerated by SHH from LNCaP cells. Furthermore, LNCaP cells and BMP-4 cooperatively induced the production of growth factors, including fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-2 and epidermal growth factor (EGF) in MC3T3-E1 cells, and these may promote the proliferation of LNCaP cells. Taken together, our findings suggest that BMPs provide favorable circumstances for the survival of prostate cancer cells and the differentiation of bone stromal cells in the bone microenvironment, possibly leading to the osteoblastic metastasis of prostate cancer.""","""['Hikaru Nishimori', 'Shogo Ehata', 'Hiroshi I Suzuki', 'Yoko Katsuno', 'Kohei Miyazono']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""J Biol Chem""","""['Osteoblast-secreted collagen upregulates paracrine Sonic hedgehog signaling by prostate cancer cells and enhances osteoblast differentiation.', 'Influence of BMPs on the formation of osteoblastic lesions in metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Menin is required for bone morphogenetic protein 2- and transforming growth factor beta-regulated osteoblastic differentiation through interaction with Smads and Runx2.', 'Bone morphogenetic proteins.', 'Osteomimetic properties of prostate cancer cells: a hypothesis supporting the predilection of prostate cancer metastasis and growth in the bone environment.', 'Antagonizing exosomal miR-18a-5p derived from prostate cancer cells ameliorates metastasis-induced osteoblastic lesions by targeting Hist1h2bc and activating Wnt/β-catenin pathway.', 'Bone Health Management in the Continuum of Prostate Cancer Disease.', 'Bone Morphogenetic Protein Signaling in Cancer; Some Topics in the Recent 10 Years.', 'Bone morphogenetic protein receptor 1α promotes osteolytic lesion of oral squamous cell carcinoma by SHH-dependent osteoclastogenesis.', ""To B (Bone Morphogenic Protein-2) or Not to B (Bone Morphogenic Protein-2): Mesenchymal Stem Cells May Explain the Protein's Role in Osteosarcomagenesis.""]"""

However, the precise role of these factors at this stage of the disease is not clear due to loss of multiple COOH-terminal AR protein domains, including the canonical nuclear localization signal (NLS) in the AR hinge region. Despite loss of this NLS, we show that diverse truncated AR variant species have a basal level of nuclear localization sufficient for ligand-independent transcriptional activity. Whereas full-length AR requires Hsp90 and importin-β for active nuclear translocation, basal nuclear localization of truncated AR variants is independent of these classical signals. For a subset of truncated AR variants, this basal level of nuclear import can be augmented by unique COOH-terminal sequences that reconstitute classical AR NLS activity. However, this property is separable from ligand-independent transcriptional activity. Therefore, the AR splice variant core consisting of the AR NH(2)-terminal domain and DNA binding domain is sufficient for nuclear localization and androgen-independent transcriptional activation of endogenous AR target genes. Indeed, we show that truncated AR variants with nuclear as well as nuclear/cytoplasmic localization patterns can drive androgen-independent growth of PCa cells.

In addition there is some evidence that moderate food consumption, reduction of dairy product consumption and an Asian or Mediterranean diet can prevent prostate cancer and also harbor additional beneficial effects for general health. These observations should be the starting point of future epidemiological research. This may be considered as a change of paradigm in prostate cancer prevention.

Ultrasound (US)-coupled transrectal electrical impedance tomography (TREIT), featuring an endorectal US probe retrofitted with electrodes, has been developed for prostate imaging. This multi-modal imaging system aims to identify suspicious tumor regions based on their electrical properties and ultimately provide additional patient-specific locations where to take biopsy samples. Unfortunately, the open-domain geometry associated with TREIT results in a severely ill-posed problem due to the small number of measurements and unbounded imaging domain. Furthermore, reconstructing contrasts within the prostate volume is challenging because the conductivity differences between the prostate and surrounding tissues are much larger than the conductivity differences between benign and malignant tissues within the prostate. To help overcome these problems, anatomically accurate hard priors can be employed to limit estimation of the electrical property distribution to within the prostate volume; however, this requires the availability of structural information. Here, a method that extracts the prostate surface from US images and incorporates this surface into the image reconstruction algorithm has been developed to enable estimation of electrical parameters within the prostate volume. In this paper, the performance of this algorithm is evaluated against a more traditional EIT algorithm that does not use anatomically accurate structural information, in the context of numerical simulations and phantom experiments. The developed anatomically accurate hard-prior algorithm demonstrably identifies contrasts within the prostate volume while an algorithm that does not rely on anatomically accurate structural information is unable to localize these contrasts. While inclusions are identified in the correct locations, they are found to be smaller in size than the actual object due to the rapid decay in sensitivity at increasing distances from the probe surface. Despite this, identifying the size of the inclusion accurately may not be essential for biopsy guidance in a clinical setting; instead, knowledge of the general vicinity of a cancerous lesion may be sufficient for suggesting and guiding clinicians to extract additional biopsy cores.""","""['H Syed', 'A Borsic', 'A Hartov', 'R J Halter']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Physiol Meas""","""['Sensitivity study of an ultrasound coupled transrectal electrical impedance tomography system for prostate imaging.', 'Electrical impedance tomography reconstruction for three-dimensional imaging of the prostate.', 'Fused-data transrectal EIT for prostate cancer imaging.', 'Magnetic resonance electrical impedance tomography (MREIT) for high-resolution conductivity imaging.', 'Electrical impedance tomography: a review of current literature.', 'Complementary use of priors for pulmonary imaging with electrical impedance and ultrasound computed tomography.', 'Absolute Reconstructions Using Rotational Electrical Impedance Tomography for Breast Cancer Imaging.', 'Evaluation of measurement and stimulation patterns in open electrical impedance tomography with scanning electrode.', 'Incorporating a biopsy needle as an electrode in transrectal electrical impedance imaging.']"""

Moreover, the ZKSCAN3 protein is highly expressed in the PC3 prostate cancer cell line, which has high metastatic potential, but little expression was observed in non-metastatic prostate cancer cell lines.

In contrast, when ZKSCAN3 cDNA was overexpressed in PC3 cells, cell detachment was observed and suspension culture induced apoptosis was greatly decreased, suggesting that ZKSCAN3 is able to enhance PC3 cell survival under anoikis stress.

Interestingly, the ZKSCAN3 gene was amplified in 26% (5/19) of metastatic prostate cancers and 20% (1/5) of lymph node metastases, but there was no amplification found in primary prostate cancers, further supporting the role of ZKSCAN3 in tumor cell migration. In vivo studies using orthotopic tumor models indicated that overexpression of ZKSCAN3 significantly enhanced tumorigenicity.

Objectives:   To assess the accuracy of chemotherapy and hormone therapy treatment data available through the Cancer Research Network's Virtual Data Warehouse (VDW).  Research design:   Retrospective, longitudinal cohort study. Medical record-abstracted, tumor registry-indicated treatments (gold standard) were compared with VDW-indicated treatments derived from health maintenance organization pharmacy, electronic medical record, and claim-based data systems.  Subjects:   Enrollees aged 18 years and older diagnosed with incident breast, colorectal, lung, or prostate cancer from 2000 through 2007.  Measures:   Sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value were computed at 6 and 12 months after cancer diagnosis.  Results:   Approximately 45% of all cancer cases (total N=23,800) were aged 64 years or younger. Overall chemotherapy sensitivity/specificities across the 3 health plans for incident breast, colorectal, lung, and prostate cancer cases were 95%/90%, 95%/93%, 93%/93%, and 85%/77%, respectively. With the exception of prostate cancer cases, overall positive predictive value ranged from 86% to 89%. Small variations in chemotherapy data accuracy existed due to cancer site and data source, whereas greater variation existed in hormone therapy capture across sites.  Conclusions:   Strong concordance exists between gold standard tumor registry measures of chemotherapy receipt and Cancer Research Network VDW data.

Methods:   Bone marrow stroma (BMS) was isolated with ethical approval from consenting patients undergoing surgery for non-malignant disease. PC-3 binding, invasion and colony formation within BMS was assessed by standardised in vitro co-culture assays in the presence of different statins.  Results:   Statins act directly on PC-3 cells with atorvastatin, mevastatin, simvastatin (1 μM) and rosuvastatin (5 μM), but not pravastatin, significantly reducing invasion towards BMS by an average of 66.68% (range 53.93-77.04%; P<0.05) and significantly reducing both number (76.2±8.29 vs 122.9±2.48; P=0.0055) and size (0.2±0.0058 mm(2) vs 0.27±0.012 mm(2); P=0.0019) of colonies formed within BMS.

However, since PolII enriched regions in the genome can be very long, existing peak finding algorithms for ChIP-seq data are not adequate for identifying such long regions.  Methods:   Here we propose an enriched region detection method for ChIP-seq data to identify long enriched regions by combining a signal denoising algorithm with a false discovery rate (FDR) approach. The binned ChIP-seq data for PolII are first processed using a non-local means (NL-means) algorithm for purposes of denoising. Then, a FDR approach is developed to determine the threshold for marking enriched regions in the binned histogram.  Results:   We first test our method using a public PolII ChIP-seq dataset and compare our results with published results obtained using the published algorithm HPeak. Our results show a high consistency with the published results (80-100%). Then, we apply our proposed method on PolII ChIP-seq data generated in our own study on the effects of hormone on the breast cancer cell line MCF7. The results demonstrate that our method can effectively identify long enriched regions in ChIP-seq datasets. Specifically, pertaining to MCF7 control samples we identified 5,911 segments with length of at least 4 Kbp (maximum 233,000 bp); and in MCF7 treated with E2 samples, we identified 6,200 such segments (maximum 325,000 bp).  Conclusions:   We demonstrated the effectiveness of this method in studying binding patterns of PolII in cancer cells which enables further deep analysis in transcription regulation and epigenetics.

The vitamin D receptor (VDR) is highly expressed in epithelial cells at risk for carcinogenesis including those resident in skin, breast, prostate and colon, providing a direct molecular link by which vitamin D status impacts on carcinogenesis. Consistent with this concept, activation of VDR by its ligand 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)(2)D) triggers comprehensive genomic changes in epithelial cells that contribute to maintenance of the differentiated phenotype, resistance to cellular stresses and protection of the genome. Many epithelial cells also express the vitamin D metabolizing enzyme CYP27B1 which enables autocrine generation of 1,25(OH)(2)D from the circulating vitamin D metabolite 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D), critically linking overall vitamin D status with cellular anti-tumor actions. Furthermore, pre-clinical studies in animal models have demonstrated that dietary supplementation with vitamin D or chronic treatment with VDR agonists decreases tumor development in skin, colon, prostate and breast. Conversely, deletion of the VDR gene in mice alters the balance between proliferation and apoptosis, increases oxidative DNA damage, and enhances susceptibility to carcinogenesis in these tissues. Because VDR expression is retained in many human tumors, vitamin D status may be an important modulator of cancer progression in persons living with cancer. Collectively, these observations reinforce the need to further define the molecular actions of the VDR and the human requirement for vitamin D in relation to cancer development and progression.""","""['Joellen Welsh']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Scand J Clin Lab Invest Suppl""","""['Cellular and molecular effects of vitamin D on carcinogenesis.', 'Vitamin D and prevention of breast cancer.', 'Role of Vitamin D Metabolism and Activity on Carcinogenesis.', 'Vitamin D and human health: lessons from vitamin D receptor null mice.', 'Vitamin D receptor (VDR) and metabolizing enzymes CYP27B1 and CYP24A1 in breast cancer.', 'Upregulation of microRNA-181a-5p increases the sensitivity of HS578T breast cancer cells to cisplatin by inducing vitamin D receptor-mediated cell autophagy.', 'Potential Use of 1-25-dihydroxyvitamin D in the Diagnosis and Treatment of Papillary Thyroid Cancer.', 'Vitamin D receptor regulates autophagy in the normal mammary gland and in luminal breast cancer cells.', 'RIPK1 binds to vitamin D receptor and decreases vitamin D-induced growth suppression.', 'Vitamin D and Mammographic Findings.']"""

The aim of this study was to determine whether occupational WBV was a risk factor for prostate cancer. Existing data, collected on 447 incident cases and 532 population controls (or their proxies), in Montreal, Canada, were used to evaluate this question. Personal interviews collected detailed job descriptions for every job held, the tasks involved, and type of equipment used. For each job, experts assessed the intensity and daily duration of WBV exposure. Inter-rater agreement for WBV ratings was examined using the kappa statistic, with values that ranged from 0.83 to 0.94. Logistic regression models explored the relationship between WBV exposure and prostate cancer, using various combinations of intensity, daily duration, and years of exposure. Potential confounders were also examined. Occupations with WBV exposure demonstrated an increased statistically non-significant risk [odds ratio (OR) = 1.44, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.99-2.09]. The risk for transport equipment operation, a job with WBV exposure, was significantly elevated (OR = 1.90, 95% CI: 1.07-3.39).

Fifty-eight patients with bladder or prostate cancer were examined on a 3 T MR unit and their respective lymph node signal intensities (SI), signal-to-noise (SNR) and contrast-to-noise (CNR) were determined on pre- and post-contrast 3D T(2)-weighted turbo spin echo (TSE) images. Based on histology and/or localization, USPIO-uptake-related SI/SNR decrease of benign vs malignant and pelvic vs inguinal lymph nodes was compared. Out of 2182 resected lymph nodes 366 were selected for MRI post-processing. Benign pelvic lymph nodes showed a significantly higher SI/SNR decrease compared with malignant nodes (p < 0.0001). Inguinal lymph nodes in comparison to pelvic lymph nodes presented a reduced SI/SNR decrease (p < 0.0001). CNR did not differ significantly between benign and malignant lymph nodes. The receiver operating curve analysis yielded an area under the curve of 0.96, and the point with optimal accuracy was found at a threshold value of 13.5% SNR decrease. Overlap of SI and SNR changes between benign and malignant lymph nodes were attributed to partial voluming, lipomatosis, histiocytosis or focal lymphoreticular hyperplasia.

Methods:   Microarray analysis showed that a novel thiazolidinedione-derived ERMA, CG-12, and glucose deprivation could suppress DNA methyltransferase (DNMT)1 expression and reactivate DNA methylation-silenced tumor suppressor genes in LNCaP prostate cancer cells. Thus, we investigated the effects of a potent CG-12 derivative, CG-5, vis-à-vis 2-deoxyglucose, glucose deprivation and/or 5-aza-deoxycytidine, on DNMT isoform expression (Western blotting, RT-PCR), DNMT1 transcriptional activation (luciferase reporter assay), and expression of genes frequently hypermethylated in prostate cancer (quantitative real-time PCR). Promoter methylation was assessed by pyrosequencing analysis. SiRNA-mediated knockdown and ectopic expression of DNMT1 were used to validate DNMT1 as a target of CG-5.  Results:   CG-5 and glucose deprivation upregulated the expression of DNA methylation-silenced tumor suppressor genes, including GADD45a, GADD45b, IGFBP3, LAMB3, BASP1, GPX3, and GSTP1, but also downregulated methylated tumor/invasion-promoting genes, including CD44, S100A4, and TACSTD2. In contrast, 5-aza-deoxycytidine induced global reactivation of these genes. CG-5 mediated these epigenetic effects by transcriptional repression of DNMT1, which was associated with reduced expression of Sp1 and E2F1. SiRNA-mediated knockdown and ectopic expression of DNMT1 corroborated DNMT1's role in the modulation of gene expression by CG-5. Pyrosequencing revealed differential effects of CG-5 versus 5-aza-deoxycytidine on promoter methylation in these genes.

GSK-3 inhibitors reduce prostate tumor cell growth; however, it is not clear if both isoforms, GSK-3α and GSK-3β, are involved. Here, we compared their expression in prostate tumors and used gene silencing to study their functions in 22Rv1 prostate cancer cells. Compared to normal prostate, GSK-3α and GSK-3β were upregulated in 25/79 and 24/79 cases of prostate cancer, respectively, with GSK-3α elevated in low Gleason sum score tumors and GSK-3β expressed in high Gleason tumors, and both isoforms correlating with high expression of the androgen receptor (AR). Gene silencing of GSK-3α and, to a lesser extent, GSK-3β reduced AR transcriptional activity. In addition, silencing of GSK-3β, but not GSK-3α, reduced Akt phosphorylation. Acute and chronic silencing of either isoform reduced 22Rv1 growth in colony formation assays; however, this did not correlate with effects on AR activity. The GSK-3 inhibitor CHIR99021 reduced 22Rv1 colony formation by 50% in normal growth medium and by 15% in hormone-depleted medium, suggesting that GSK-3 is required both for hormone-dependent and hormone-independent proliferation.

We aimed to assess the association between an objective measure of ambient UVR exposure and risk of total and site-specific cancer in a large, regionally diverse cohort [450,934 white, non-Hispanic subjects (50-71 years) in the prospective National Institutes of Health (NIH)-AARP Diet and Health Study] after accounting for individual-level confounding risk factors. Estimated erythemal UVR exposure from satellite Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) data from NASA was linked to the US Census Bureau 2000 census tract (centroid) of baseline residence for each subject. We used Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for multiple potential confounders to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for quartiles of UVR exposure. Restricted cubic splines examined nonlinear relationships. Over 9 years of follow-up, UVR exposure was inversely associated with total cancer risk (N = 75,917; highest versus lowest quartile; HR = 0.97, 95% CI = 0.95-0.99; p-trend < 0.001). In site-specific cancer analyses, UVR exposure was associated with increased melanoma risk (highest versus lowest quartile; HR = 1.22, 95% CI = 1.13-1.32; p-trend < 0.001) and decreased risk of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (HR = 0.82, 95% CI = 0.74-0.92) and colon (HR = 0.88, 95% CI = 0.82-0.96), squamous cell lung (HR = 0.86, 95% CI = 0.75-0.98), pleural (HR = 0.57, 95% CI = 0.38-0.84), prostate (HR = 0.91, 95% CI = 0.88-0.95), kidney (HR = 0.83, 95% CI = 0.73-0.94) and bladder (HR = 0.88, 95% CI = 0.81-0.96) cancers (all p-trend < 0.05).

To assess the effect of smoking at diagnosis on survival, structured smoking assessments were obtained in a cohort of 5,185 cancer patients within 30 days of a cancer diagnosis between 1982 and 1998. Hazard ratios (HRs) or odds ratios were generated to analyze the effects of smoking at diagnosis on overall mortality (OM) and disease-specific mortality (DSM) in a patient cohort from 13 disease sites containing at least 100 patients in each disease site. With a minimum of 12 years of follow-up, current smoking increased OM risk versus recent quit (HR 1.17), former (HR 1.29) and never smokers (HR 1.38) in the overall cohort. Current smoking increased DSM risk versus former (HR 1.23) and never smokers (HR 1.18). In disease sites with proportionately large (>20%) recent quit cohorts (lung and head/neck), current smoking increased OM and DSM risks as compared with recent quit. Current smoking increased mortality risks in lung, head/neck, prostate and leukemia in men and breast, ovary, uterus and melanoma in women. Current smoking was not associated with any survival benefit in any disease site.

Some data suggest that men with certain conditions may be more susceptible to developing cardiovascular disease than others.  Objective:   To assess whether the risk of myocardial infarction (MI) or diabetes during ADT is modified by specific baseline comorbidities.  Design, setting, and participants:   We conducted a population-based observational study of 185 106 US men ≥66 yr of age diagnosed with local/regional PCa from 1992 to 2007. We assessed comorbidities monthly over the follow-up period.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Cox proportional hazards models with time-varying variables assessing incident diabetes or MI.  Results and limitations:   A total of 49.9% of the men received ADT during follow-up. Among men with no comorbidities, ADT was associated with an increase in the adjusted hazard of MI (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR]: 1.09; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-1.16) and diabetes (AHR: 1.33; 95% CI, 1.27-1.39). Risks of MI and diabetes were similarly increased among men with and without specific comorbid illnesses (p>0.10 for all interactions, with one exception). Previous MI, congestive heart failure, peripheral arterial disease, stroke, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and renal disease were associated with new MI and diabetes, and obesity and rheumatologic disease were also associated with diabetes. Limitations include the observational study design, reliance on administrative data to ascertain outcomes, and lack of information on risk factors such as smoking and family history.  Conclusions:   Traditional risk factors for MI and diabetes were also associated with developing these conditions during ADT but did not significantly modify the risk attributable to ADT. Strategies to screen and prevent diabetes and cardiovascular disease in men with PCa should be similar to the strategies recommended for the general population.""","""['Nancy L Keating', ""A James O'Malley"", 'Stephen J Freedland', 'Matthew R Smith']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Re: does comorbidity influence the risk of myocardial infarction or diabetes during androgen-deprivation therapy for prostate cancer?', 'Androgen-deprivation therapy for nonmetastatic prostate cancer is associated with an increased risk of peripheral arterial disease and venous thromboembolism.', 'Diabetes and cardiovascular disease during androgen deprivation therapy: observational study of veterans with prostate cancer.', 'Diabetes and cardiovascular disease during androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Quantifying observational evidence for risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular disease following androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer: a meta-analysis.', 'Adding abiraterone to androgen deprivation therapy in men with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer: A\xa0systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Review of Cardiovascular Risk of Androgen Deprivation Therapy and the Influence of Race in Men with Prostate Cancer.', 'Management of Biochemical Recurrence of Prostate Cancer After Curative Treatment: A Focus on Older Patients.', 'Conventional androgen deprivation therapy is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease in advanced prostate cancer, a nationwide population-based study.', 'Association between medical androgen deprivation therapy and long-term cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality in nonmetastatic prostate cancer.', 'Impact of Hypertension on Early Renal Dysfunction in Japanese Prostate Cancer Patients Treated With Androgen Deprivation Therapy.']"""

Design:   Retrospective electronic chart abstraction.  Setting:   Marshfield Clinic, the largest private multispecialty group practice in Wisconsin, and one of the largest in the United States, provides health care services annually to approximately 385,000 unique patients through 1.8 million annual patient encounters.  Participants:   Individuals within the Marshfield Clinic cancer registry who had been diagnosed with prostate cancer between 1960 and 2009.  Methods:   Electronic chart abstraction from the cancer registry and the electronic medical record was conducted (N=6,181). Data abstracted included age at diagnosis; stage and grade of tumor; prostate specific antigen (PSA) values before, at, and after diagnosis; initial cancer treatment; follow-up time; subsequent cancer treatments; evidence of metastasis; age of death; and cause of death, if known.  Results:   The average age of prostate cancer diagnosis has decreased from 70-71 years in the 1960's and 1970's to an average age at diagnosis of 67 years in the 2000's (P<0.001). This decrease in age occurred within the decades of implementation of PSA screening. Approximately 74% of men diagnosed with prostate cancer within the PSA screening era had at least one PSA test, and the presence of a PSA test did not appear to change treatment outcome. Age, grade, and stage were the biggest predictors of prostate cancer outcome. There was no difference in event-free survival between current treatment types (radical prostatectomy, brachytherapy, photon treatment, or intensity-modulated radiation therapy) (2003 or later) when stratified by age (greater than 85%, 5-year event-free survival P=0.85); however, more events occurred with older external beam radiation treatment regimens (1993-2003) (70% to 75%, 5-year event-free survival P=0.001).

Methods and materials:   This randomized phase III trial compared conventional fractionation (80 Gy at 2 Gy per fraction in 8 weeks) vs hypofractionation (62 Gy at 3.1 Gy per fraction in 5 weeks) in combination with 9-month androgen deprivation therapy in 168 patients with high-risk prostate cancer. Freedom from biochemical failure (FFBF), freedom from local failure (FFLF), and freedom from distant failure (FFDF) were analyzed.  Results:   In a median follow-up of 70 months, biochemical failure (BF) occurred in 35 of the 168 patients (21%) in the study. Among these 35 patients, local failure (LF) only was detected in 11 (31%), distant failure (DF) only in 16 (46%), and both LF and DF in 6 (17%). In 2 patients (6%) BF has not yet been clinically detected. The risk reduction by hypofractionation was significant in BF (10.3%) but not in LF and DF. We found that hypofractionation, with respect to conventional fractionation, determined only an insignificant increase in the actuarial FFBF but no difference in FFLF and FFDF, when considering the entire group of patients. However, an increase in the 5-year rates in all 3 endpoints-FFBF, FFLF, and FFDF-was observed in the subgroup of patients with a pretreatment prostate-specific antigen (iPSA) level of 20 ng/mL or less. On multivariate analysis, the type of fractionation, iPSA level, Gleason score of 4+3 or higher, and T stage of 2c or higher have been confirmed as independent prognostic factors for BF. High iPSA levels and Gleason score of 4+3 or higher were also significantly associated with an increased risk of DF, whereas T stage of 2c or higher was the only independent variable for LF.  Conclusion:   Our results confirm the isoeffectiveness of the 2 fractionation schedules used in this study, although a benefit in favor of hypofractionation cannot be excluded in the subgroup of patients with an iPSA level of 20 ng/mL or less.

Materials and methods:   The induction patterns of HIF-1α and -2α after treatment with ZnSO4 were evaluated in PC3 and DU145 cells. Both cell lines were transfected with siRNA targeted against HIF-1α and/or -2α, and the expression patterns of these 2 HIF isoforms were examined. We next performed cell counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assays and matrigel invasion assays. Potential additive effects of HIF blockade to chemotherapy (docetaxel) or target agents (sunitinib and sorafenib) were examined. In addition, gene expression changes were determined in ZnSO4-treated DU145 cells using Western blotting.  Results:   ZnSO4 affected the expression of HIF in a dose-dependent manner. HIF expression was increased within the first 3 hours but then decreased. Cells in which HIF-1α and/or -2α had been knocked down using siRNA showed decreased cell viability. Invasion abilities were increased by ZnSO4 treatment in both cell lines overexpressing HIF. However, invasion potencies were decreased in response to treatment with HIF siRNAs. Blocking HIF prominently augmented the antitumor effects of target agents. The underlying mechanism could be associated with p21, cMET, IGF-1, and GLUT-1.
