The ongoing United Kingdom Collaborative Trial of Ovarian Cancer Screening involves 202,638 low-risk postmenopausal women. The performance characteristics on prevalence screen in sensitivity, specificity, and stage distribution have been encouraging. Screening differs from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial in the use of algorithms to interpret CA125 and ultrasound imaging and well-defined, centrally coordinated management of screen-detected abnormalities with protocols for intervention based on screening findings.

We describe here two novel in vivo metrics of cell proliferation in men with prostate neoplasia.  Experimental design:   Three groups of men drank heavy water, a nonradioactive, stable isotopic tracer for 14 to 28 days: (i) healthy men, (ii) men scheduled for transrectal core needle biopsy, and (iii) men scheduled for radical prostatectomy. Prostate epithelial cells (PEC) were isolated from ejaculated seminal fluid in all subjects. Histologically graded lesions were microdissected from tissue slides obtained from subjects undergoing surgery and proliferation rates were measured from isolated cells via mass spectrometry.  Results:   Proliferation rates of seminal PEC in healthy men (0.10%-0.27%/d) were stable on repeat sampling. Rates above 0.34%/d were seen only in patients with cancer where rates increased progressively from normal tissue through benign prostate hyperplasia, prostate intraepithelial neoplasia, and tumor grades III and IV in all subjects. Seminal PEC kinetics correlated highly with the most proliferative microdissected region in each subject (r(2) = 0.94).  Conclusions:   Prostate cell proliferation can be measured in vivo from microdissected histopathology sections or noninvasively from seminal fluid where the latter reflects the most proliferative region of the gland. This approach may allow monitoring of progression in men with low-risk prostate cancer.""","""['Gregory M Hayes', 'Jeff Simko', 'Daniel Holochwost', 'Kyle Kuchinsky', 'Robert Busch', 'Lisa Misell', 'Elizabeth J Murphy', 'Peter Carroll', 'June Chan', 'Katsuto Shinohara', 'Marc K Hellerstein']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Clin Cancer Res""","""['Prostate cancer: Heavy water labelling could be used to monitor progression of low-risk prostate cancer.', 'p63 cytoplasmic aberrance is associated with high prostate cancer stem cell expression.', 'The morphogenesis of cancer of the prostate (immunohistochemical research).', 'Lymphatic vessel density in the normal-looking columnar epithelium adjacent to and distant from prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and prostate cancer assessed in whole-mount sections.', 'Repeat biopsy strategy in patients with atypical small acinar proliferation or high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia on initial prostate needle biopsy.', 'Seminal vesicle intraepithelial neoplasia versus basal cell hyperplasia in a seminal vesicle.', 'Semen as a rich source of diagnostic biomarkers for prostate cancer: latest evidence and implications.', 'In vivo kinetics and nonradioactive imaging of rapidly proliferating cells in graft-versus-host disease.', 'Analysis of Mammalian Cell Proliferation and Macromolecule Synthesis Using Deuterated Water and Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry.', 'Strategies for Extending Metabolomics Studies with Stable Isotope Labelling and Fluxomics.', 'Prostate cancer: Heavy water labelling could be used to monitor progression of low-risk prostate cancer.']"""

This study evaluated biologic and clinical effects of figitumumab, a fully human monoclonal IGF-IR antibody, in patients with localized prostate cancer.  Experimental design:   Eligible patients received figitumumab 20 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks for 3 cycles followed by prostatectomy. The primary endpoint was IGF-IR expression inhibition as assessed by immunohistochemistry.  Results:   Sixteen patients were accrued. Median age was 63 years, median prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was 7.2 μg/L (range, 2.5-35), clinical stage was T1 in four patients and T2 in 12 patients, Gleason score ≤ 7 or >7 in 15 and one patients. Two patients received only 1 cycle (patient choice and grade III hyperglycemia). A PSA decline from baseline of ≥ 25% and ≥ 50% occurred in 15 (94%) and 5 (31%) of patients. Mean figitumumab concentration was 350.4 μg/mL (range, 26.3-492.8) in plasma and 51.3 μg/g (range, 27.4-79.6) in prostate tissue. Compared with pretreatment biopsies, IGF-IR expression decreased in the prostatectomy specimens in 14 of 16 patients. The mean IGF-IR immunohistochemistry visual score was 2.1 (SD = 0.6) in biopsy and 1.1 (SD = 0.5) in prostatectomy specimens (P < 0.0001). Androgen receptor expression was also decreased and there was a trend for a decrease in downstream IGF-IR signaling components.  Conclusions:   Figitumumab is biologically active in prostate cancer. PSA declines in treatment-naive patients were observed, potentially mediated by IGF-IR effects on androgen receptor expression. These results support the clinical relevance of IGF-IR signaling in prostate cancer and justify further clinical trials.""","""['Kim N Chi', 'Martin E Gleave', 'Ladan Fazli', 'S Larry Goldenberg', 'Alan So', 'Christian Kollmannsberger', 'Nevin Murray', 'Anna Tinker', 'Michael Pollak']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Clin Cancer Res""","""['Up-regulation of insulin-like growth factor axis components in human primary prostate cancer correlates with tumor grade.', 'Plasma and tissue insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR) as a prognostic marker for prostate cancer and anti-IGF-IR agents as novel therapeutic strategy for refractory cases: a review.', 'Update on Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center studies of neoadjuvant hormonal therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Factors affecting recurrence rates after prostatectomy or radiotherapy in localized prostate carcinoma patients with biopsy Gleason score 8 or above.', 'Figitumumab (CP-751,871) for cancer therapy.', 'Emerging Role of IGF-1 in Prostate Cancer: A Promising Biomarker and Therapeutic Target.', 'Preclinical Evaluation of a New Format of 68Ga- and 111In-Labeled Affibody Molecule ZIGF-1R:4551 for the Visualization of IGF-1R Expression in Malignant Tumors Using PET and SPECT.', 'The IGF-II-Insulin Receptor Isoform-A Autocrine Signal in Cancer: Actionable Perspectives.', 'New incriminating evidence against IGF2.', 'Recent advances on the progressive mechanism and therapy in castration-resistant prostate cancer.']"""

We assembled a cohort of six patients with high-risk disease, and performed deep RNA and shallow DNA sequencing in primary tumours and matched metastases where available. Our analysis identified copy number abnormalities, accurately profiled gene expression levels, and detected both differential splicing and expressed fusion genes. We revealed occult and potentially dormant metastases, unambiguously supporting the patients' clinical history, and implicated the REST transcriptional complex in the development of neuroendocrine prostate cancer, validating this finding in a large independent cohort. We massively expand on the number of novel fusion genes described in prostate cancer; provide fresh evidence for the growing link between fusion gene aetiology and gene expression profiles; and show the utility of fusion genes for molecular pathology.

However, because of steric constraints associated with interfacial packing and molecular orientations, the binding efficiency is often very low. In this study, spectroscopic ellipsometry and neutron reflection have been used to investigate how solution pH, salt concentration and surface chemistry affect antibody adsorption and subsequent antigen binding. The adsorbed amount of antibody was found to vary with pH and the maximum adsorption occurred between pH 5 and 6, close to the isoelectric point of the antibody. By contrast, the highest antigen binding efficiency occurred close to the neutral pH. Increasing the ionic strength reduced antibody adsorbed amount at the silica-water interface but had little effect on antigen binding. Further studies of antibody adsorption on hydrophobic C8 (octyltrimethoxysilane) surface and chemical attachment of antibody on (3-mercaptopropyl)trimethoxysilane/4-maleimidobutyric acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester-modified surface have also been undertaken. It was found that on all surfaces studied, the antibody predominantly adopted the 'flat on' orientation, and antigen-binding capabilities were comparable.

Histone deacetylases (HDACs), a family of evolutionarily conserved enzymes, counterbalance the acetylation of lysine residues on histone and non-histone proteins. In this study, we demonstrate that green tea polyphenols (GTPs) and their major constituent, (-) epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), activate p53 through acetylation at the Lys373 and Lys382 residues by inhibiting class I HDACs in LNCaP human prostate cancer cells. Treatment of cells with GTPs (2.5-10 µg/ml) and EGCG (5-20 µM) resulted in dose- and time-dependent inhibition of class I HDACs (HDAC1, 2, 3 and 8), albeit at varying levels. Discontinuation of treatment with GTP/EGCG resulted in the loss of p53 acetylation at both the sites in these cells. GTP/EGCG treatment also resulted in increased expression of p21/waf1 and Bax at the protein and message levels in these cells. The increased GTP/EGCG-mediated p53 acetylation enhanced its binding on the promoters of p21/waf1 and Bax, which was associated with increased accumulation of cells in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle and induction of apoptosis. Our findings indicate that GTP/EGCG causes acetylation of p53 by inhibiting class I HDACs, a function that is likely to be part of the mechanisms that control the physiological activity of p53.""","""['Vijay S Thakur', 'Karishma Gupta', 'Sanjay Gupta']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Int J Oncol""","""['Green tea polyphenols causes cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in prostate cancer cells by suppressing class I histone deacetylases.', 'Ablation of either p21 or Bax prevents p53-dependent apoptosis induced by green tea polyphenol epigallocatechin-3-gallate.', 'Green tea polyphenols induce p53-dependent and p53-independent apoptosis in prostate cancer cells through two distinct mechanisms.', 'Histone deacetylase inhibitors: signalling towards p21cip1/waf1.', 'Molecular Targets of Epigallocatechin-Gallate (EGCG): A Special Focus on Signal Transduction and Cancer.', 'Niacin mitigates rumen epithelial damage in vivo by inhibiting rumen epithelial cell apoptosis on a high concentrate diet.', ""Circulating (Poly)phenol Metabolites: Neuroprotection in a 3D Cell Model of Parkinson's Disease."", 'Role of Flavonoids as Epigenetic Modulators in Cancer Prevention and Therapy.', 'Cardiac troponin I R193H mutant interacts with HDAC1 to repress phosphodiesterase 4D expression in cardiomyocytes.', 'The Major Constituent of Green Tea, Epigallocatechin-3-Gallate (EGCG), Inhibits the Growth of HPV18-Infected Keratinocytes by Stimulating Proteasomal Turnover of the E6 and E7 Oncoproteins.']"""

TIO was suspected, and increased levels of FGF23 reinforced such diagnosis. The patient died 4 months after being diagnosed with TIO.

Therefore, there is a need for novel markers in the detection and management of PCa. The 80-kDa soluble form of E-cadherin (sE-cad) and the cytokine IL-6 are being discussed as supplemental serum markers for PCa. In this study, sE-cad and IL-6 serum levels were determined in patients with pathological localized or locally advanced PCa without any previous treatment. These patients underwent radical retropubic prostatectomy (RRP) in accordance with the EAU Guidelines on Prostate Cancer. The molecules were determined via immunoenzymatic assays in samples collected before and after surgery. Statistical analysis was performed by Student's t-test and Pearson's correlation test. sE-cad levels were 6.0 ± 2.7 and 4.6 ± 2.3 µg/ml, before and after RRP, respectively. A highly statistically significant decrease in sE-cad concentrations after RRP was observed (p<0.0001), in 50/61 patients (82%). sE-cad levels before and after surgery were correlated (Pearson's correlation coefficient, r=0.6993, p<0.0001). sE-cad values detected after surgery were higher in patients with PSA levels >10 ng/ml (p<0.05). sE-cad levels before RRP were significantly higher in patients with G3 tumours compared to those with G2 tumours (p<0.02). Finally, sE-cad concentrations both before and after surgery were higher in tumours with Gleason score =7 compared to those with Gleason score <7 (p<0.002 and p<0.05, respectively). Preliminary data from 20 patients indicated a statistically significant increase in IL-6 levels after RRP (11.2 vs. 7.2 pg/ml, p<0.001). This is the first study on the reduction in sE-cad levels after RRP in PCa patients. Moreover, it shows that preoperative sE-cad concentrations are higher in patients with less differentiated PCa. Promising findings of this pilot study may lead to investigation of sE-cad in a larger study with follow-up.""","""['Fortunata Iacopino', 'Francesco Pinto', 'Alessandro Bertaccini', 'Alessandro Calarco', 'Gabriella Proietti', 'Angelo Totaro', 'Giuseppe Martorana', 'Pierfrancesco Bassi', 'Gigliola Sica']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Oncol Rep""","""['Sex hormone-binding globulin is a significant predictor of extracapsular extension in men undergoing radical prostatectomy.', 'Preoperative PSA level significantly associated with interval to biochemical progression after radical retropubic prostatectomy.', 'Radical prostatectomy for incidental (stage T1a-T1b) prostate cancer: analysis of predictors for residual disease and biochemical recurrence.', 'Impact of positive surgical margins on prostate-specific antigen failure after radical prostatectomy in adjuvant treatment-naïve patients.', 'IGF-II serum levels increase discrimination between benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer and improve the predictive value of PSA in clinical staging.', 'Application of Proteogenomics to Urine Analysis towards the Identification of Novel Biomarkers of Prostate Cancer: An Exploratory Study.', 'Association Between IL-4 and IL-6 Expression Variants and Gastric Cancer Among Portuguese Population.', 'IL-6 Inhibits the Targeted Modulation of PDCD4 by miR-21 in Prostate Cancer.', 'sE-cadherin serves as a diagnostic and predictive parameter in prostate cancer patients.', 'Levels of soluble E-cadherin in breast, gastric, and colorectal cancers.']"""

Demethoxycurcumin (DMC) is a candidate that has been verified in several tumor types and has potential for the treatment of prostate cancer. In the present study, we investigated the effects of DMC on proliferation, apoptosis and migration of PC-3 cells. MTT assay results indicated that DMC inhibited PC-3 cell viability in a dose- and time-dependent manner, and DMC induced G2/M phase arrest. Furthermore, PC-3 cells in DMC-treated groups had a higher apoptotic rate compared with DMSO-treated control. This effect may be due to the activation of the caspase-3 pathway. In DMC-treated groups, migrating and invasive cells were dramatically reduced (P<0.05). The activity of MMP-2, which is correlated with migration and invasion was also suppressed by DMC. These results indicated that DMC may inhibit PC-3 cell migration and invasion partially by affecting MMP-2 activity.

Prognosis and study of influential variables""","""Background:   To study the biochemical progression-free survival (BPFS) achieved by a group of high risk patients in accordance with D'Amico's classification treated with radical prostatectomy. To identify the clinical-pathological variables which are influential in biochemical progression-free survival and, if possible, use them to design a prognostic model.  Material and methods:   The study involves 232 patients, out of a series of 1,054, diagnosed with clinically localized prostate cancer, qualified as high risk on D'Amico's classification (PSA>20 ng/ml or Gleason score 8-10 or T3) treated with radical prostatectomy. The BPFS is studied and the clinical-pathological variables obtained (PSA, Gleason score of the biopsy and of the piece, clinical and pathological study, unilateral or bilateral affectation, margins of the prostatectomy piece, Ki-67 expression) are analyzed to identify whether they influenced the BPFS. Contingency tables and tables for survival analysis: Kaplan-Meyer, log-rank and Cox models were used for the statistical study.  Results:   Descriptive study: PSA: 23.3 ng/ml (median); cGleason 2-6: 33%; 7: 13%; 8-10: 54%; T2: 58%; Bilateral affectation in the diagnostic biopsy: 59%; RNM T2: 60%; RNM T3: 40%. pGleason 2-6: 24%; 7: 28%; 8-10: 48%; pT2: 43%; pT3a: 30%; pT3b: 27%; Affected margin: 51%; N1:13%. Progression-free survival: with a mean and median follow-up of 64 months; 53% show biochemical progression. The median until progression: 42 months. Progression-free survival at 5 and 10 years is 43±3% and 26±7%. The multivariate study (Cox models) shows that the variables that are independently influential in the BPFS are the affectation of margins (HR: 3.5; 95% IC.1.9-6.7; p<0001); and Ki67 >10% (HR: 2.3; 95% IC: 1.2-4.3; P: 0.009). Risk groups: using the two influential variables and employing Cox models, three risk groups emerged as the best model: Group 1 (0 variables present); Group 2 (1 variable); Group 3 (2 variables). The progression-free survival is 69±8%; 27±6% and 18±11% at 5 years. The differences amongst the three groups are significant.

Here we use high-resolution transcriptome-scale ribosome profiling to monitor translation in mouse cells acutely treated with the mTOR inhibitor Torin 1, which, unlike rapamycin, fully inhibits mTORC1 (ref. 2). Our data reveal a surprisingly simple model of the mRNA features and mechanisms that confer mTORC1-dependent translation control. The subset of mRNAs that are specifically regulated by mTORC1 consists almost entirely of transcripts with established 5' terminal oligopyrimidine (TOP) motifs, or, like Hsp90ab1 and Ybx1, with previously unrecognized TOP or related TOP-like motifs that we identified. We find no evidence to support proposals that mTORC1 preferentially regulates mRNAs with increased 5' untranslated region length or complexity. mTORC1 phosphorylates a myriad of translational regulators, but how it controls TOP mRNA translation is unknown. Remarkably, loss of just the 4E-BP family of translational repressors, arguably the best characterized mTORC1 substrates, is sufficient to render TOP and TOP-like mRNA translation resistant to Torin 1. The 4E-BPs inhibit translation initiation by interfering with the interaction between the cap-binding protein eIF4E and eIF4G1. Loss of this interaction diminishes the capacity of eIF4E to bind TOP and TOP-like mRNAs much more than other mRNAs, explaining why mTOR inhibition selectively suppresses their translation. Our results clarify the translational program controlled by mTORC1 and identify 4E-BPs and eIF4G1 as its master effectors.""","""['Carson C Thoreen', 'Lynne Chantranupong', 'Heather R Keys', 'Tim Wang', 'Nathanael S Gray', 'David M Sabatini']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Nature""","""[""Cancer biology: The director's cut."", 'Re: A unifying model for mTORC1-mediated regulation of mRNA translation.', 'La-related Protein 1 (LARP1) Represses Terminal Oligopyrimidine (TOP) mRNA Translation Downstream of mTOR Complex 1 (mTORC1).', 'Role of p70S6K1-mediated phosphorylation of eIF4B and PDCD4 proteins in the regulation of protein synthesis.', 'Stable isotope-labelling analysis of the impact of inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin on protein synthesis.', ""Translational control of mRNAs by 3'-Untranslated region binding proteins."", 'mTOR-sensitive translation: Cleared fog reveals more trees.', ""Salamanders' regenerative potential might be driven by a specific protein variant."", 'Evolutionarily divergent mTOR remodels translatome for tissue regeneration.', 'Effects of Different Dietary Starch Sources and Digestible Lysine Levels on Carcass Traits, Serum Metabolites, Liver Lipid and Breast Muscle Protein Metabolism in Broiler Chickens.', 'The coordinated management of ribosome and translation during injury and regeneration.', 'Translational control of Ybx1 expression regulates cardiac function in response to pressure overload in vivo.']"""

Given that the reported efficacy of AA is lower following docetaxel vs. pre-docetaxel, the potential exists for cross resistance given docetaxel's partly androgen receptor targeting activity. The efficacy of docetaxel following ketoconazole (KC), a weaker and nonspecific inhibitor of CYP17, may provide some insights into this potential interaction. We retrospectively evaluated the efficacy of every 3-week docetaxel with prednisone (DP) in mCRPC previously exposed to KC compared to KC-naive patients.  Materials and methods:   A randomized phase II trial of men with mCRPC treated with DP + AT-101 (bcl-2 inhibitor) vs. DP plus placebo was analyzed. Both arms were combined for analysis as no significant differences were seen. Overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), objective response (ORR), pain, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response rates were estimated with and without prior KC. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate the effect of covariates on OS.  Results:   Of 220 evaluable men, 40 (18.2%) received prior KC. The median OS with DP-based therapy of KC-naive patients (18.3 months, 95% CI: 15.0, 24.5) and post-KC patients (17.0 months, 95% CI: 9.9, 20.4) was not statistically different (P = 0.20). After controlling for prognostic classifications, analyses demonstrated consistent trends for worsening of OS after KC, with (hazard ratios (HRs) 1.33-1.46. Similar unfavorable trends were observed for ORR, PSA declines, and PFS.  Conclusions:   In this hypothesis-generating analysis, patients treated with docetaxel-based chemotherapy following prior KC had numerically and consistently worse outcomes than patients not exposed to prior KC. Although the estimated differences did not attain statistical significance, evaluation of outcomes with docetaxel in particular, and all classes of novel and emerging agents following AA, is of clinical importance, given its more potent androgen synthesis inhibition compared with KC.

In addition, determinants of erectile function (EF) and the extent of sexual activity were investigated. We conducted a multicentric, longitudinal study in seven German hospitals before, 3, 6 and 12 months after radical prostatectomy (RP). A total of 329 patients were asked to self-assess the symptoms associated with erectile dysfunction (ED). These symptoms were assessed using the International Index of Erectile Function and EORTC QLQ-PR25 questionnaires. A multiple regression model was used to test the influence of clinical, socio-demographic and quality-of-life-associated variables on the patients' EF 1 year after RP. Before surgery, 39% of patients had a severe ED (complete impotence). At 3, 6 and 12 months after surgery, it was 80, 79 and 71%, respectively. Although the surgical approach had no significant effect on EF, patients who had undergone nerve-sparing surgery had significantly lower ED rates. Nevertheless, 1 year after RP, 66% of these patients had severe ED. Age, nerve-sparing status and the burden of urinary symptoms had the greatest impact on the patients' EF. Regardless of nerve-sparing status and surgical approach, postsurgical improvement of EF does not mean a full convalescence of presurgical EF. Instead, it may rather reduce the degree of postsurgical ED in time. Consequently, urologists should disclose to the patient that ED is a likely side effect of RP.""","""['N Koehler', 'S Holze', 'L Gansera', 'U Rebmann', 'S Roth', 'H-J Scholz', 'D Fahlenkamp', 'R Thiel', 'E Braehler']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Int J Impot Res""","""['Evaluation of erectile function after laparoscopic radical prostatectomy in a single center.', 'Defining the impact of vascular risk factors on erectile function recovery after radical prostatectomy.', 'Prediction of postoperative sexual function after nerve sparing radical retropubic prostatectomy.', 'Prevention and management of postprostatectomy sexual dysfunctions part 2: recovery and preservation of erectile function, sexual desire, and orgasmic function.', 'Tadalafil rehabilitation therapy for erectile dysfunction following prostatectomy.', 'Is there a role for stem cell therapy in erectile dysfunction secondary to cavernous nerve injury?

This study investigated the hypothesis that IGF-1R regulates DNA double strand break (DSB) repair.  Methods:   We tested effects of IGF-1R siRNA transfection on the repair of radiation-induced DSBs by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence for γH2AX, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Homologous recombination (HR) was quantified by reporter assays, and cell cycle distribution by flow cytometry.  Results:   We confirmed that IGF-1R depletion sensitized DU145 and PC3 prostate cancer cells to ionizing radiation. DU145 control transfectants resolved radiation-induced DSBs within 24 h, while IGF-1R depleted cells contained 30-40% unrepaired breaks at 24 h. IGF-1R depletion induced significant reduction in DSB repair by HR, although the magnitude of the repair defect suggests additional contributory factors. Radiation-induced G2-M arrest was attenuated by IGF-1R depletion, potentially suppressing cell cycle-dependent processes required for HR. In contrast, IGF-1R depletion induced only minor radiosensitization in LNCaP cells, and did not influence repair. Cell cycle profiles were similar to DU145, so were unlikely to account for differences in repair responses.  Conclusions:   These data indicate a role for IGF-1R in DSB repair, at least in part via HR, and support use of IGF-1R inhibitors with DNA damaging cancer treatments.""","""['Benjamin W Turney', 'Martin Kerr', 'Meenali M Chitnis', 'Kunal Lodhia', 'Yong Wang', 'Johann Riedemann', 'Mark Rochester', 'Andrew S Protheroe', 'Simon F Brewster', 'Valentine M Macaulay']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Radiother Oncol""","""['IGF-1R inhibition enhances radiosensitivity and delays double-strand break repair by both non-homologous end-joining and homologous recombination.', 'Suppression of homologous recombination sensitizes human tumor cells to IGF-1R inhibition.', 'Insulin-like growth factor-type 1 receptor inhibitor NVP-AEW541 enhances radiosensitivity of PTEN wild-type but not PTEN-deficient human prostate cancer cells.', 'DNA double strand break repair inhibition as a cause of heat radiosensitization: re-evaluation considering backup pathways of NHEJ.', 'The Determinant of DNA Repair Pathway Choices in Ionising Radiation-Induced DNA Double-Strand Breaks.', 'Local non-pituitary growth hormone is induced with aging and facilitates epithelial damage.', 'CHK1 inhibition exacerbates replication stress induced by IGF blockade.', 'Dual Characters of GH-IGF1 Signaling Pathways in Radiotherapy and Post-radiotherapy Repair of Cancers.', 'EPHA2 Interacts with DNA-PKcs in Cell Nucleus and Controls Ionizing Radiation Responses in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Cells.', 'Nuclear IGF1R interact with PCNA to preserve DNA replication after DNA-damage in a variety of human cancers.']"""

It is important to identify differentially expressed genes between PCa and normal prostate tissues and to reveal the function of these genes that are involved in progression of PCa.  Methods:   We performed cDNA microarray analysis to identify differentially expressed genes, calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase 2 (CAMKK2). Immunohistochemical analysis was conducted to investigate the relationship between the CAMKK2 expression level and prognosis. The function of CAMKK2 was assessed by generating CAMKK2 overexpressed LNCaP cells and by knockdown of CAMKK2.  Results:   We identified CAMKK2 overexpressed six times in PCa more than normal prostate by cDNA microarray analysis. Immunohistochemical analysis of CAMKK2 protein showed that CAMKK2 protein was expressed more in PCa than normal tissue. However, the expression in the high-grade PCa diminished. Moreover, the narrowness of CAMKK2-positive area before ADT was a poor prognostic factor. Androgen-deprivation treatment from the medium in which LNCaP cells were cultured in the presence of 10 nM DHT repressed CAMKK2 expression. CAMKK2 overexpressed LNCaP cells (LNCaP/GFP-CAMKK2) attenuated androgen-sensitivity. Tumorigenesis of LNCaP/GFP-CAMKK2 cells in male SCID mice was decreased compared with control cells irrespective of castration. Finally, knockdown of CAMKK2 mRNA in LNCaP cells induced androgen-hypersensitivity and stimulated LNCaP cell proliferation.  Conclusions:   Induction of androgen-hypersensitivity after ADT may be involved in down-regulation of CAMKK2. This result may provide new therapeutic approach to keep androgen-sensitivity of PCa after ADT.""","""['Takashi Shima', 'Atsushi Mizokami', 'Toru Miyagi', 'Keiichi Kawai', 'Kouji Izumi', 'Misako Kumaki', 'Mitsuo Ofude', 'Jian Zhang', 'Evan T Keller', 'Mikio Namiki']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['A regulatory feedback loop between Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase 2 (CaMKK2) and the androgen receptor in prostate cancer progression.', 'Establishment and characterization of androgen-independent human prostate cancer cell lines, LN-REC4 and LNCaP-SF, from LNCaP.', 'Y-box binding protein-1 promotes castration-resistant prostate cancer growth via androgen receptor expression.', 'Oxidative stress and androgen receptor signaling in the development and progression of castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Regulation and role of CAMKK2 in prostate cancer.', 'Roles of calcium signaling in cancer metastasis to bone.', 'Radioresistance in Prostate Cancer: Focus on the Interplay between NF-κB and SOD.', 'CaMKK2 facilitates Golgi-associated vesicle trafficking to sustain cancer cell proliferation.', 'Hinge Binder Scaffold Hopping Identifies Potent Calcium/Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinase Kinase 2 (CAMKK2) Inhibitor Chemotypes.', 'A complete map of the Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase 2 (CAMKK2) signaling pathway.']"""

This study evaluates whether such replication SNPs or other candidate SNPs are associated with CaP aggressiveness in African-American (AA) and European-American (EA) men.  Methods:   A 1,536 SNP panel which included 34 genome-wide association study (GWAS) replication SNPs, 38 flanking SNPs, a set of ancestry informative markers, and SNPs in candidate genes and other areas was genotyped in 1,060 AA and 1,087 EA men with incident CaP from the North Carolina-Louisiana Prostate Cancer Project (PCaP). Tests for association were conducted using ordinal logistic regression with a log-additive genotype model and a 3-category CaP aggressiveness variable.  Results:   Four GWAS replication SNPs (rs2660753, rs13254738, rs10090154, rs2735839) and seven flanking SNPs were associated with CaP aggressiveness (P < 0.05) in three genomic regions: One at 3p12 (EA), seven at 8q24 (5 AA, 2 EA), and three at 19q13 at the kallilkrein-related peptidase 3 (KLK3) locus (two AA, one AA and EA). The KLK3 SNPs also were associated with serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels in AA (P < 0.001) but not in EA.

VEGF is believed to implicate poor prognosis in various cancers. The overexpression of VEGF may be an early step in the process of metastasis.  Methods:   ELISA was used to investigate the levels of VEGF, bFGF and IL8 in human bone metastatic LNCaP-derivative C4-2B prostate cancer cell line and its parental cell line, LNCaP and to determine the effect of bevacizumab on reducing the level of VEGF. Cell proliferation assay, invasion assay and in vitro angiogenesis assay were performed under the condition with bevacizumab or control IgG.  Results:   Human bone metastatic LNCaP-derivative C4-2B prostate cancer cell line expressed a higher level of VEGF than its parental primary prostate cancer cell line LNCaP. The effect of bevacizumab is dose-dependent and time-dependent: 100 μg/mL of bevacizumab and 3-day treatment was more effective than low-dose and lesser-day treatment for decreasing the level of VEGF.

We have adapted this strategy to develop new polymeric photosensitizer prodrugs (PPP) sensitive to urokinase-like plasminogen activator (uPA). In these compounds (to be referred to as uPA-PPPs) multiple copies of pheophorbide a are attached to a polymeric carrier via peptide linkers that can be cleaved by uPA, a protease overexpressed in prostate cancer (PCa). uPA-PPPs are non-phototoxic in their native state but become fluorescent and produce singlet oxygen after uPA-mediated activation. In the present work, we studied the influence of side-chain modifications, molecular weight, and overall charge on the photoactivity and pharmacokinetics of uPA-PPPs. An in vitro promising candidate with convertible phototoxicity was then further investigated in vivo. Systemic administration resulted in a selective accumulation and activation of the prodrug in luciferase transfected PC-3 xenografts, resulting in a 4-fold increase in fluorescence emission over time. Irradiation of fluorescent tumors induced immediate tumor cell eradication as shown by whole animal bioluminescence imaging.

Androgens are hydrophobic and as such require carrier proteins, including sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), to enable efficient distribution from sites of biosynthesis to target tissues. The similarly hydrophobic corticosteroids also require a carrier protein whose affinity for steroid is modulated by proteolysis. However, proteolytic mechanisms regulating the SHBG/androgen complex have not been reported. Here, we show that the cancer-associated serine proteases, kallikrein-related peptidase (KLK)4 and KLK14, bind strongly to SHBG in glutathione S-transferase interaction analyses. Further, we demonstrate that active KLK4 and KLK14 cleave human SHBG at unique sites and in an androgen-dependent manner. KLK4 separated androgen-free SHBG into its two laminin G-like (LG) domains that were subsequently proteolytically stable even after prolonged digestion, whereas a catalytically equivalent amount of KLK14 reduced SHBG to small peptide fragments over the same period. Conversely, proteolysis of 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT)-bound SHBG was similar for both KLKs and left the steroid binding LG4 domain intact. Characterization of this proteolysis fragment by [(3)H]-labeled DHT binding assays revealed that it retained identical affinity for androgen compared with full-length SHBG (dissociation constant = 1.92 nM). Consistent with this, both full-length SHBG and SHBG-LG4 significantly increased DHT-mediated transcriptional activity of the androgen receptor compared with DHT delivered without carrier protein. Collectively, these data provide the first evidence that SHBG is a target for proteolysis and demonstrate that a stable fragment derived from proteolysis of steroid-bound SHBG retains binding function in vitro.""","""['Washington Y Sanchez', 'Simon J de Veer', 'Joakim E Swedberg', 'Eui-Ju Hong', 'Janet C Reid', 'Terry P Walsh', 'John D Hooper', 'Geoffrey L Hammond', 'Judith A Clements', 'Jonathan M Harris']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Endocrinology""","""['Biological effects of sex hormone-binding globulin on androgen-induced proliferation and androgen metabolism in LNCaP prostate cells.', 'Relative binding affinity of anabolic-androgenic steroids: comparison of the binding to the androgen receptors in skeletal muscle and in prostate, as well as to sex hormone-binding globulin.', 'Structure-function relationships of rat androgen--binding protein/human sex-hormone binding globulin: the effect of mutagenesis on steroid-binding parameters.', 'Prolactin influences upon androgen action in male accessory sex organs.', 'Structural analyses of sex hormone-binding globulin reveal novel ligands and function.', 'The Roles of Androgens in Humans: Biology, Metabolic Regulation and Health.', 'KLK4 Induces Anti-Tumor Effects in Human Xenograft Mouse Models of Orthotopic and Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', ""Advanced high-grade serous ovarian cancer: inverse association of KLK13 and KLK14 mRNA levels in tumor tissue and patients' prognosis."", 'Kallikrein-related peptidase 4 induces cancer-associated fibroblast features in prostate-derived stromal cells.', 'Kallikrein-related peptidase 8 is expressed in myocardium and induces cardiac hypertrophy.']"""

This hybrid navigation approach allowed us to accurately identify marker seeds in a phantom setup. The multispectral nature of the fluorescence endoscope enabled stepwise visualization of the two clinically approved fluorescent dyes, fluorescein and indocyanine green. In addition, the approach was used to navigate toward the prostate in a patient undergoing robot-assisted prostatectomy.

However, the results are still limited and the diagnosis of major forms of cancer, such as prostate cancer, are currently based on systematic biopsies. The difficulty in the detection of angiogenesis partly resides in a complex relationship between angiogenesis and perfusion. This may be overcome by analysis of the dispersion kinetics of ultrasound contrast agents. Determined by multipath trajectories through the microvasculature, dispersion permits a better characterization of the microvascular architecture and, therefore, more accurate detection of angiogenesis. In this paper, a novel dispersion analysis method is proposed for prostate cancer localization. An ultrasound contrast agent bolus is injected intravenously. Spatiotemporal analysis of the concentration evolution measured at different pixels in the prostate is used to assess the local dispersion kinetics of the injected agent. In particular, based on simulations of the convective diffusion equation, the similarity between the concentration evolutions at neighbor pixels is the adopted dispersion measure.

PCa mortality is higher among black and younger white men in a band of states spanning from Washington DC to Louisiana (the ""PCa belt""). This study assessed the associations of birth and adult residence in the PCa belt with PCa mortality among black and white men and trends in these associations over time.  Methods:   PCa-specific mortality rates in 1980, 1990, and 2000 for black and white men born in the continental US, aged 40-89, were calculated by linking national mortality records with population data based on birth state, state of residence at the census, race, and age. PCa belt (Washington DC, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Mississippi, Alabama, and Louisiana) birth was cross-classified against PCa belt adult residence.  Results:   Black men born in the PCa belt had elevated PCa mortality in 1980, 1990, and 2000. Associations were independent of adult residence in the PCa belt. For example, in 2000, black men aged 65-89 who were born in the PCa belt but no longer lived there in adulthood had an odds ratio of 1.19 (1.14-1.24) for PCa mortality compared to black men born and residing outside the PCa belt.

To increase the recurrence-free and overall survival, we conducted an adjuvant, randomized trial using docetaxel (T) in PC patients (Scandinavian Prostate Cancer Group trial 13).  Methods:   The inclusion criteria are the following: men >18 and ≤75 years of age, WHO/ECOG performance status 0--1, histologically proven PC within 12 months before randomization and one of the following: T2, Gleason 7 (4+3), PSA >10; T2, Gleason 8--10, any PSA; or any T3 tumors.

Recent in vitro evidence has demonstrated significant alterations in cell survival occurring out-of-field which cannot be accounted for on the basis of scattered dose. The radiobiological effect of area, dose and dose-rate on out-of-field cell survival responses following exposure to intensity-modulated radiation fields is presented in this study. Cell survival was determined by clonogenic assay in human prostate cancer (DU-145) and primary fibroblast (AG0-1522) cells following exposure to different modulated field configurations delivered using a X-Rad 225 kVp x-ray source. Uniform survival responses were compared to in- and out-of-field responses in which 25-99% of the cell population was shielded. Dose delivered to the out-of-field region was varied from 1.6-37.2% of that delivered to the in-field region using different levels of brass shielding. Dose rate effects were determined for 0.2-4 Gy min⁻¹ for uniform and modulated exposures with no effect seen in- or out-of-field. Survival responses showed little dependence on dose rate and area in- and out-of-field with a trend towards increased survival with decreased in-field area. Out-of-field survival responses were shown to scale in proportion to dose delivered to the in-field region and also local dose delivered out-of-field. Mathematical modelling of these findings has shown survival response to be highly dependent on dose delivered in- and out-of-field but not on area or dose rate.

Yet, few studies emphasize the interaction of variant apoptotic genes and their joint modifying effects on prostate cancer (PCA) outcomes. An exhaustive assessment of all the possible two-, three- and four-way gene-gene interactions is computationally burdensome. This statistical conundrum stems from the prohibitive amount of data needed to account for multiple hypothesis testing.  Methods:   To address this issue, we systematically prioritized and evaluated individual effects and complex interactions among 172 apoptotic SNPs in relation to PCA risk and aggressive disease (i.e., Gleason score ≥ 7 and tumor stages III/IV). Single and joint modifying effects on PCA outcomes among European-American men were analyzed using statistical epistasis networks coupled with multi-factor dimensionality reduction (SEN-guided MDR). The case-control study design included 1,175 incident PCA cases and 1,111 controls from the prostate, lung, colo-rectal, and ovarian (PLCO) cancer screening trial. Moreover, a subset analysis of PCA cases consisted of 688 aggressive and 488 non-aggressive PCA cases. SNP profiles were obtained using the NCI Cancer Genetic Markers of Susceptibility (CGEMS) data portal. Main effects were assessed using logistic regression (LR) models. Prior to modeling interactions, SEN was used to pre-process our genetic data. SEN used network science to reduce our analysis from > 36 million to < 13,000 SNP interactions. Interactions were visualized, evaluated, and validated using entropy-based MDR. All parametric and non-parametric models were adjusted for age, family history of PCA, and multiple hypothesis testing.  Results:   Following LR modeling, eleven and thirteen sequence variants were associated with PCA risk and aggressive disease, respectively. However, none of these markers remained significant after we adjusted for multiple comparisons. Nevertheless, we detected a modest synergistic interaction between AKT3 rs2125230-PRKCQ rs571715 and disease aggressiveness using SEN-guided MDR (p = 0.011).  Conclusions:   In summary, entropy-based SEN-guided MDR facilitated the logical prioritization and evaluation of apoptotic SNPs in relation to aggressive PCA. The suggestive interaction between AKT3-PRKCQ and aggressive PCA requires further validation using independent observational studies.""","""['Nicole A Lavender', 'Erica N Rogers', 'Susan Yeyeodu', 'James Rudd', 'Ting Hu', 'Jie Zhang', 'Guy N Brock', 'Kevin S Kimbro', 'Jason H Moore', 'David W Hein', 'La Creis R Kidd']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""BMC Med Genomics""","""['Interaction among variant vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptor in relation to prostate cancer risk.', 'Toll-like receptor-associated sequence variants and prostate cancer risk among men of African descent.', 'Genetic variants in cell cycle control pathway confer susceptibility to aggressive prostate carcinoma.', 'No association between variant DNA repair genes and prostate cancer risk among men of African descent.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'PRKCE non-coding variants influence on transcription as well as translation of its gene.', 'Polymorphic variants of the CASP3, CASP9, BCL-2 and NKX3-1 genes as candidate markers for prostate cancer susceptibility and poor prognosis.', 'Relationship Between CASP9 and CASP10 Gene Polymorphisms and Cancer Susceptibility: Evidence from an Updated Meta-analysis.', ""Exploring Prostate Cancer Patients' Interest and Preferences for Receiving Genetic Risk Information About Cancer Aggressiveness."", 'SNP by SNP by environment interaction network of alcoholism.']"""

Current tissue extraction protocols involve sample destruction, precluding additional uses of the tissue. This is particularly problematic for high value samples with limited availability, such as clinical tumor biopsies that require structural preservation to histologically diagnose and gauge cancer aggressiveness. To overcome this limitation and increase the amount of information obtained from patient biopsies, we developed and characterized a workflow to perform metabolomic analysis and histological evaluation on the same biopsy sample.  Methods:   Biopsies of ten human tissues (muscle, adrenal gland, colon, lung, pancreas, small intestine, spleen, stomach, prostate, kidney) were placed directly in a methanol solution to recover metabolites, precipitate proteins, and fix tissue. Following incubation, biopsies were removed from the solution and processed for histology. Kidney and prostate cancer tumor and benign biopsies were stained with hemotoxylin and eosin and prostate biopsies were subjected to PIN-4 immunohistochemistry.

The number (ranging from 260 in prostate to 340 in colon) and identity of metabolites were comparable to results obtained with the current method requiring 30 mg ground tissue. Comparing relative levels of metabolites, cancer tumor from benign kidney and prostate biopsies could be distinguished. Successful histopathological analysis of biopsies by chemical staining (hematoxylin, eosin) and antibody binding (PIN-4, in prostate) showed cellular architecture and immunoreactivity were retained.  Conclusions:   Concurrent metabolite extraction and histological analysis of intact biopsies is amenable to the clinical workflow. Methanol fixation effectively preserves a wide range of tissues and is compatible with chemical staining and immunohistochemistry. The method offers an opportunity to augment histopathological diagnosis and tumor classification with quantitative measures of biochemicals in the same tissue sample. Since certain biochemicals have been shown to correlate with disease aggressiveness, this method should prove valuable as an adjunct to differentiate cancer aggressiveness.""","""['Meredith V Brown', 'Jonathan E McDunn', 'Philip R Gunst', 'Elizabeth M Smith', 'Michael V Milburn', 'Dean A Troyer', 'Kay A Lawton']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Genome Med""","""['Molecular preservation by extraction and fixation, mPREF: a method for small molecule biomarker analysis and histology on exactly the same tissue.', 'Translational Metabolomics of Head Injury: Exploring Dysfunctional Cerebral Metabolism with Ex Vivo NMR Spectroscopy-Based Metabolite Quantification.', 'Metabolite Analysis and Histology on the Exact Same Tissue: Comprehensive Metabolomic Profiling and Metabolic Classification of Prostate Cancer.', 'Use of Deep Learning to Develop and Analyze Computational Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining of Prostate Core Biopsy Images for Tumor Diagnosis.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Trends in Population-Based Studies: Molecular and Digital Epidemiology (Review).', 'Data-driven identification of plasma metabolite clusters and metabolites of interest for potential detection of early-stage non-small cell lung cancer cases versus cancer-free controls.', 'Relevance of Circulating Tumor Cells as Predictive Markers for Cancer Incidence and Relapse.', 'Endogenous Metabolites Released by Sanitized Sprouting Alfalfa Seed Inhibit the Growth of Salmonella enterica.', 'Machine learning assisted intraoperative assessment of brain tumor margins using HRMAS NMR spectroscopy.']"""

Of the 242 patients, 119 (49.2%) were treated with (125)I and 123 (50.8%) with (103)Pd. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was used to analyze BRFS, defined according to the Phoenix definition (prostate-specific antigen nadir plus 2 ng/mL) with respect to Gleason score, stage, pretreatment prostate-specific antigen level, and source selection. Late genitourinary/gastrointestinal toxicities were assessed using the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group/European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer scale.

Increasing evidence also supports their involvement in the development of certain lung, colon and prostate cancers.  Methods:   In this study we systemically surveyed endogenous estrogen and estrogen metabolite levels in each of the NCI-60 human tumor cell lines, which include human breast, central nerve system, colon, ovarian, prostate, kidney and non-small cell lung cancers, as well as melanomas and leukemia. The absolute abundances of these metabolites were measured using a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method that has been previously utilized for biological fluids such as serum and urine.  Results:   Endogenous estrogens and estrogen metabolites were found in all NCI-60 human tumor cell lines and some were substantially elevated and exceeded the levels found in well known estrogen-dependent and estrogen receptor-positive tumor cells such as MCF-7 and T-47D. While estrogens were expected to be present at high levels in cell lines representing the female reproductive system (that is, breast and ovarian), other cell lines, such as leukemia and colon, also contained very high levels of these steroid hormones. The leukemia cell line RMPI-8226 contained the highest levels of estrone (182.06 pg/106 cells) and 17β-estradiol (753.45 pg/106 cells). In comparison, the ovarian cancer cell line with the highest levels of these estrogens contained only 19.79 and 139.32 pg/106 cells of estrone and 17β-estradiol, respectively. The highest levels of estrone and 17β-estradiol in breast cancer cell lines were only 8.45 and 87.37 pg/106 cells in BT-549 and T-47D cells, respectively.  Conclusions:   The data provided evidence for the presence of significant amounts of endogenous estrogens and estrogen metabolites in cell lines not commonly associated with these steroid hormones. This broad discovery of endogenous estrogens and estrogen metabolites in these cell lines suggest that several human tumors may be beneficially treated using endocrine therapy aimed at estrogen biosynthesis and estrogen-related signaling pathways.""","""['Xia Xu', 'Timothy D Veenstra']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Genome Med""","""['Estrogen metabolism and risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal women.', 'Quantitative measurement of endogenous estrogens and estrogen metabolites in human serum by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.', 'Relationship between estrogen receptors, 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and estrogen content in human breast cancer.', 'Importance of estrogen sulfates in breast cancer.', 'Effect of nomegestrol acetate on estrogen biosynthesis and transformation in MCF-7 and T47-D breast cancer cells.', 'Potentiation of temozolomide activity against glioblastoma cells by aromatase inhibitor letrozole.', 'Nanoscale Metal-Organic Framework Mediates Radical Therapy to Enhance Cancer Immunotherapy.', 'Sex-dependent association of circulating sex steroids and pituitary hormones with treatment-free survival in chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients.', 'Hop (Humulus lupulus L.)

During pre-clinical evaluation, rhArg has exhibited significant anti-proliferative activity in cancer cells deficient in the expression of ornithine carbamoyl transferase (OCT). Interestingly, a variety of cancer cells such as melanoma and prostate cancer deficient in argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS) are sensitive to arginine deprivation by arginine deiminase. In this study, we investigated levels of gene expression of OCT and ASS, and the effects of rhArg in human prostate cancer cells: LNCaP (androgen-dependent), PC-3 and DU-145 (both androgen-independent).  Results:   Quantitative real-time PCR showed minimal to absent gene expression of OCT, but ample expression of ASS expression in all 3 cell lines. Cell viability assay after 72-h exposure of rhArg showed all 3 lines had half maximal inhibitory concentration less than or equal to 0.02 U/ml. Addition of ornithine to cell culture media failed to rescue these cells from rhArg-mediated cytotoxicity.Decreased phosphorylation of 4E-BP1, a downstream effector of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), was noted in DU-145 and PC-3 after exposure to rhArg. Moreover, there was no significant apoptosis induction after arginine deprivation by rhArg in all 3 prostate cancer cell lines.  Conclusion:   rhArg causes significant cytotoxicity in LNCaP, DU-145 and PC-3 prostate cancer cells which all demonstrate decreased OCT expression.

In this study, we investigated the mechanism underlying the anti-tumor effects of a TIMP-2 fusion protein conjugated with human serum albumin (HSA/TIMP-2). Systemic administration of HSA/TIMP-2 effectively inhibited tumor growth at a minimum effective dose of 60 mg/kg. The suppressive effect of HSA/TIMP-2 was accompanied by a marked reduction of in vivo vascularization. The anti-angiogenic activity of HSA/TIMP-2 was directly confirmed by CAM assays. In HSA/TIMP-2-treated tumor tissues, MMP-2 expression was profoundly decreased without a change in MT1-MMP expression of PECAM-1-positive cells. MMP-2 mRNA was also decreased by HSA/TIMP-2 treatment of human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Zymographic analysis showed that HSA/TIMP-2 substantially decreased extracellular pro-MMP-2 activity (94-99% reduction) and moderately decreased active MMP-2 activity (10-24% reduction), suggesting MT1-MMP-independent MMP-2 modulation. Furthermore, HSA/TIMP-2 had no effect on in vitro active MMP-2 activity and in vivo MMP-2 activity.

This provides the rationale for development of inhibitors of Sp TFs as cancer therapeutics. Mithramycin A (MTM-A) is a natural polyketide that binds GC-rich DNA sequences, inhibits activity of Sp TFs and exhibits potent antitumor activity in experimental systems. However, clinical use of MTM-A is limited by the severe toxicity of the compound. Here, we studied two MTM-A analogues, which had been generated by genetically engineering of the MTM-A biosynthetic pathway, and evaluated their activity in human prostate cancer in cell cultures and mouse models. The compounds, named MTM-SDK and MTM-SK, were highly effective in vitro inhibiting proliferation of prostate cancer cells and transcription of Sp-regulated genes by blocking binding of Sp proteins to the gene promoters. When administered to mice, both compounds were well tolerated with maximum tolerated doses of MTM-SDK and MTM-SK, respectively, 4- and 32- fold higher than MTM-A. After systemic administration, both compounds were cleared rapidly from the bloodstream but maintained plasma levels well above the active concentrations required in vitro for inhibition of Sp TF activity and cell proliferation. Consistently, MTM-SDK and MTM-SK inhibited transcription of Sp-regulated genes in prostate tumor xenografts and exhibited potent antitumor activity in subcutaneous and metastatic tumor xenograft models with no or minimal toxicity. Taken together, these data indicate that MTM-SDK and MTM-SK possess significantly improved pharmacological and toxicological properties compared to MTM-A and represent promising drugs for treatment of advanced prostate cancer.""","""['Anastasia Malek', 'Luz-Elena Núñez', 'Marco Magistri', 'Lara Brambilla', 'Sandra Jovic', 'Giuseppina M Carbone', 'Francisco Morís', 'Carlo V Catapano']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Inhibition of Sp1-dependent transcription and antitumor activity of the new aureolic acid analogues mithramycin SDK and SK in human ovarian cancer xenografts.', 'Novel GC-rich DNA-binding compound produced by a genetically engineered mutant of the mithramycin producer Streptomyces argillaceus exhibits improved transcriptional repressor activity: implications for cancer therapy.', 'Inhibition of c-src transcription by mithramycin: structure-activity relationships of biosynthetically produced mithramycin analogues using the c-src promoter as target.', 'Mithramycin, an agent for developing new therapeutic drugs for neurodegenerative diseases.', 'The antitumor antibiotic mithramycin: new advanced approaches in modification and production.', 'Controlled Release of DNA Binding Anticancer Drugs from Gold Nanoparticles with Near-Infrared Radiation.', 'Transcription factor SP1 regulates haptoglobin fucosylation via induction of GDP-fucose transporter 1 in the hepatoma cell line HepG2.', 'Mithramycin and Analogs for Overcoming Cisplatin Resistance in Ovarian Cancer.', ""Mithramycin 2'-Oximes with Improved Selectivity, Pharmacokinetics, and Ewing Sarcoma Antitumor Efficacy."", 'SP8 Promotes an Aggressive Phenotype in Hepatoblastoma via FGF8 Activation.']"""

Methods:   Two-thousand four hundred twenty-nine men who received definitive radiotherapy with or without androgen-deprivation therapy (median follow-up, 74 months) were analyzed.  Results:   There was a migration of stage II patients to stage I with AJCC seventh edition (stage I increased from 1% to 38%, and stage II decreased from 91% to 55%). One pair-wise comparison (4%) of Kaplan-Meier estimates of biochemical failure, distant metastasis, prostate cancer-specific survival, and overall survival between stages was statistically significant for the AJCC sixth edition.

In the current study, the authors addressed these gaps by providing unique estimates of the effects of a cancer diagnosis on HRQOL accounting for the confounding effects of ageing and comorbidity.  Methods:   Data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registry were linked with Medicare Health Outcomes Survey (MHOS) data. Eligible patients (n = 445) were Medicare beneficiaries aged ≥65 years from 1998 to 2003 whose first prostate cancer diagnosis occurred between their baseline and follow-up MHOS. By using propensity score matching, 2225 participants without cancer were identified from the MHOS data. Analysis of covariance models were used to estimate changes in HRQOL as assessed with the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36 survey and the activities of daily living scale.  Results:   Before diagnosis, patients with prostate cancer reported HRQOL similar to that of men without cancer. After diagnosis, men with prostate cancer experienced significant decrements in physical, mental, and social aspects of their lives relative to controls, especially within the first 6 months after diagnosis. For men who were surveyed beyond 1 year after diagnosis, HRQOL was similar to that for controls. However, an increased risk for major depressive disorder was observed among men who received either conservative management or external beam radiation.  Conclusions:   The current findings illustrated the time-sensitive nature of decline in HRQOL after a cancer diagnosis and enhanced understanding of the impact of prostate cancer diagnosis and treatment on physical, mental, and social well being among older men.""","""['Bryce B Reeve', 'Angela M Stover', 'Roxanne E Jensen', 'Ronald C Chen', 'Kathryn L Taylor', 'Steven B Clauser', 'Sean P Collins', 'Arnold L Potosky']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Cancer""","""['Impact of cancer on health-related quality of life of older Americans.', 'Impact of colorectal cancer diagnosis and treatment on health-related quality of life among older Americans: a population-based, case-control study.', 'The effects of cancer and racial disparities in health-related quality of life among older Americans: a case-control, population-based study.', 'The effect of androgen deprivation therapy on health-related quality of life in men with prostate cancer.', 'How does active surveillance for prostate cancer affect quality of life?

The relationship between change in self-efficacy and long-term physical activity (PA) also was examined.  Methods:   Breast and prostate cancer survivors (N = 543) from 39 US states and two Canadian provinces participated in the FRESH START intervention trial. Participants were randomly assigned to receive a 10-month program of mailed print materials on diet and PA available in the public domain or a 10-month program of tailored materials designed to increase fruit and vegetable (F&V) intake, decrease fat intake, and/or increase PA. Changes in self-efficacy for F&V intake and fat restriction were analyzed as potential mediators of the intervention's effects on diet at 2-year follow-up. Because we previously found that change in self-efficacy for PA did not vary by group assignment, the relationship between change in self-efficacy and PA at 2-year follow-up was examined across study conditions.  Results:   Results suggest that change in self-efficacy for fat restriction partially explained the intervention's effect on fat intake (mean indirect effect = -0.28), and change in self-efficacy for F&V consumption partially explained the intervention's effect on daily F&V intake (mean indirect effect = .11). Change in self-efficacy for fat restriction partially accounted for the intervention's impact on overall diet quality among men only (mean indirect effect = 0.60). Finally, change in self-efficacy for PA predicted PA at 2-year follow-up.

There are impediments to this, one being CBCT number accuracy. The purpose of this study was to investigate CBCT number correction methods and the affect of residual inaccuracies on dose deposition. Four different correction strategies were applied to the same patient data to compare performance and the sophistication of correction-method needed for acceptable dose errors.  Methods and materials:   Planning CT and CBCT reconstructions were used for 12 patients (6 brain, 3 prostate, and 3 bladder cancer patients). All patients were treated using Elekta linear accelerators and XVI imaging systems. Two of the CBCT number correction methods investigated were based on an algorithm previously proposed by the authors but only previously applied to phantoms. Two further methods, based on an approach previously suggested in the research literature, were also examined. Dose calculations were performed using scans of a ""worst"" subset of patients using the Pinnacle³ version 9.0 treatment planning system and the patients' clinical plans.  Results:   All mean errors in CBCT number were <50 HU, and all correction methods performed well or adequately in dose calculations. The worst single dose discrepancy identified for any of the examined methods or patients was 3.0%. Mean errors in the doses to treatment volumes or organs at risk were negatively correlated with the mean error in CT number. That is, a mean CT number that was too large, averaged over the entire CBCT volume, implied an underdosing in a volume-of-interest and vice versa.  Conclusions:   Results suggest that (1) the correction of CBCT numbers to within a mean error of 50 HU in the scan volume provides acceptable discrepancies in dose (<3%) and (2) this is achievable with even quite unsophisticated correction methods.""","""['Gavin G Poludniowski', 'Philip M Evans', 'Steve Webb']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Quantitative cone-beam CT imaging in radiation therapy using planning CT as a prior: first patient studies.', 'Megavoltage cone beam computed tomography dose and the necessity of reoptimization for imaging dose-integrated intensity-modulated radiotherapy for prostate cancer.', 'Comparison of CT number calibration techniques for CBCT-based dose calculation.', 'The influence of the bowel and bladder preparation protocol for radiotherapy of prostate cancer using kilo-voltage cone beam CT: Our experience.', 'Deep learning methods for enhancing cone-beam CT image quality toward adaptive radiation therapy: A systematic review.', 'CBCT-to-CT Translation Using Registration-Based Generative Adversarial Networks in Patients with Head and Neck Cancer.', 'Feasibility evaluation of kilovoltage cone-beam computed tomography dose calculation following scatter correction: investigations of phantom and representative tumor sites.', 'Dosimetric benefits of daily treatment plan adaptation for prostate cancer stereotactic body radiotherapy.', 'Cone beam CT based dose calculation in the thorax region.', 'Evaluating the impact of cone-beam computed tomography scatter mitigation strategies on radiotherapy dose calculation accuracy.']"""

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified over 40 risk-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), including variants in androgen pathway genes (e.g., KLK3 and AR). Androgens are important in PC and genes involved in this pathway are therefore candidates for conferring susceptibility to PC.  Methods:   In this hypothesis-testing study, we evaluated PC risk in association with SNPs in 22 candidate genes involved in androgen metabolism or interactions with the androgen receptor (AR). A total of 187 SNPs were genotyped in 1458 cases and 1351 age-matched controls from a population-based study. PC risk was estimated using adjusted unconditional logistic regression and multinomial regression models.  Results:   Single SNP analyses showed evidence (p < 0.05) for associations with 14 SNPs in 9 genes: NKX3.1, HSD17B3, AKR1C3, SULT2A1, CYP17A1, KLK3, JAK2, NCOA4 and STAT3.

The sulfhydryl modified single-strand aptamer could interact with AuNPs, which made the AuNPs stable in high concentration of salt. In pH 7.0 BR buffer solution, the highly selective combination of PSA and AuNPs-labeling aptamer resulted in the aggregation of AuNPs which showed high RLS intensity. Under the optimal conditions, the magnitude of enhanced RLS intensity (ΔI(RLS)) was proportional to the concentration of PSA in the range from 0.13 to 110 ng/mL, with a detection limit (LOD, 3σ) of 0.032 ng/mL. This developed RLS assay as well as a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit was successfully applied to the detection of PSA in 15 serum samples, and an excellent correlation of the levels of PSA measured was obtained.

We also investigate their biological characteristics as potential tumor imaging agents mediated by alanine-serine-cysteine preferring (ASC) transporter system.  Methods:   Three new (18)F alanine derivatives were prepared from corresponding tosylate-precursors through a two-step labeling reaction. In vitro uptake studies to evaluate and to compare these three analogs were carried out in 9L glioma and PC-3 prostate cancer cell lines. Potential transport mechanisms, protein incorporation and stability of 3-(1-[(18)F]fluoromethyl)-L-alanine (L-[(18)F]FMA) were investigated in 9L glioma cells. Its biodistribution was determined in a rat-bearing 9L tumor model. PET imaging studies were performed on rat bearing 9L glioma tumors and transgenic mouse carrying spontaneous generated M/tomND tumor (mammary gland adenocarcinoma).  Results:   New (18)F alanine derivatives were prepared with 7%-34% uncorrected radiochemical yields, excellent enantiomeric purity (>99%) and good radiochemical purity (>99%). In vitro uptake of the L-[(18)F]FMA in 9L glioma and PC-3 prostate cancer cells was higher than that observed for the other two alanine derivatives and [(18)F]FDG in the first 1h. Inhibition of cell uptake studies suggested that L-[(18)F]FMA uptake in 9L glioma was predominantly via transport system ASC. After entering into cells, L-[(18)F]FMA remained stable and was not incorporated into protein within 2h. In vivo biodistribution studies demonstrated that L-[(18)F]FMA had relatively high uptake in liver and kidney. Tumor uptake was fast, reaching a maximum within 30 min. The tumor-to-muscle, tumor-to-blood and tumor-to-brain ratios at 60 min post injection were 2.2, 1.9 and 3.0, respectively. In PET imaging studies, tumors were visualized with L-[(18)F]FMA in both 9L rat and transgenic mouse.  Conclusion:   L-[(18)F]FMA showed promising properties as a PET imaging agent for up-regulated ASC transporter associated with tumor proliferation.""","""['Limin Wang', 'Zhihao Zha', 'Wenchao Qu', 'Hongwen Qiao', 'Brian P Lieberman', 'Karl Plössl', 'Hank F Kung']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Nucl Med Biol""","""['Synthesis and evaluation of ¹⁸F labeled FET prodrugs for tumor imaging.', 'Comparative evaluation of 18F-labeled glutamic acid and glutamine as tumor metabolic imaging agents.', 'Synthesis and comparative biological evaluation of L- and D-isomers of 18F-labeled fluoroalkyl phenylalanine derivatives as tumor imaging agents.', '68Ga-Labeled alanine derivatives of 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,7-diacetic acid and 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,-triacetic acid.', '18F-(2S,4R)4-fluoroglutamine.', 'Chemical Reporters for Bacterial Glycans: Development and Applications.', 'Sensing Living Bacteria in Vivo Using d-Alanine-Derived 11C Radiotracers.', 'Flagging Bacteria with Radiolabeled d-Amino Acids.', 'Deconstructive fluorination of cyclic amines by carbon-carbon cleavage.', 'Pathogen-Specific Bacterial Imaging in Nuclear Medicine.']"""

Initial classification with central DXA demonstrated 60 (17%) normal, 187 (55%) osteopenic, and 96 (28%) osteoporotic patients. Sixteen of 60 (27%) normal patients were reclassified as osteopenic (14) or osteoporotic (2), and 20 of 187 (11%) osteopenic patients were reclassified as osteoporotic with the combination of central DXA plus distal third radius DXA. The difference in reclassification was statistically significant. The addition of distal third radius to central DXA scanning in men with bone loss associated with ADT identifies a statistically significant number of men being reclassified as having osteopenia or osteoporosis. Combined central and distal third radius DXA scanning should be considered routine in the evaluation of all men suspected of bone loss associated with ADT. This has specific significant clinical relevance because of the large number of men with nonevaluable central DXA studies.

Methods and materials:   Three or 4 gold FMs were implanted in 37 patients with prostate adenocarcinoma receiving androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in conjunction with 70-78 Gy. Androgen deprivation therapy was started a median of 3.9 months before EBRT (range, 0.3-12.5 months). To establish the extent of FM migration, the distance between each FM was calculated for 5-8 treatments once per week throughout the EBRT course. For each treatment, the distance between FMs was compared with the distance from the digitally reconstructed radiographs generated from the planning CT. A total of 281 treatments were analyzed.  Results:   The average daily migration was 0.8 ± 0.3 mm, with distances ranging from 0.2 mm-2.6 mm. Two of the 281 assessed treatments (0.7%) showed migrations >2 mm. No correlation between FM migration and patient weight or time delay between ADT and start of EBRT was found. There was no correlation between the extent of FM migration and prostate volume.  Conclusion:   This is the largest report of implanted FM migration in patients receiving concomitant ADT. Only 0.7% of the 281 treatments studied had significant marker migrations (>2 mm) throughout the course of EBRT.

Methods and materials:   Intrafractional motion trajectories of 15 prostate cancer patients were the basis for this phantom study; prostate motion had been monitored with the Calypso System. An industrial robot moved a phantom along these trajectories, motion was detected via an infrared camera system, and the robotic HexaPOD couch was used for real-time counter-steering. Residual phantom motion during real-time tracking was measured with the infrared camera system. Film dosimetry was performed during delivery of 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT), step-and-shoot intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), and volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT).  Results:   Motion of the prostate was largest in the anterior-posterior direction, with systematic (∑) and random (σ) errors of 2.3 mm and 2.9 mm, respectively; the prostate was outside a threshold of 5 mm (3D vector) for 25.0%±19.8% of treatment time. Real-time tracking reduced prostate motion to ∑=0.01 mm and σ = 0.55 mm in the anterior-posterior direction; the prostate remained within a 1-mm and 5-mm threshold for 93.9%±4.6% and 99.7%±0.4% of the time, respectively. Without real-time tracking, pass rates based on a γ index of 2%/2 mm in film dosimetry ranged between 66% and 72% for 3D-CRT, IMRT, and VMAT, on average. Real-time tracking increased pass rates to minimum 98% on average for 3D-CRT, IMRT, and VMAT.

Objective:   We aimed to create a statistical model to calculate the decrease in risk of death associated with surgery for an individual patient, using stage, grade, prostate-specific antigen, and age as predictors.  Design, setting, and participants:   A total of 695 men with T1 or T2 prostate cancer participated in the Scandinavian Prostate Cancer Group 4 trial (SPCG-4).  Intervention:   Patients in SPCG-4 were randomized to radical prostatectomy or conservative management.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Competing risk models were created separately for the radical prostatectomy and the watchful waiting group, with the difference between model predictions constituting the estimated benefit for an individual patient.  Results and limitations:   Individualized predictions of surgery benefit varied widely depending on age and tumor characteristics. At 65 yr of age, the absolute 10-yr risk reduction in prostate cancer mortality attributable to radical prostatectomy ranged from 4.5% to 17.2% for low- versus high-risk patients. Little expected benefit was associated with surgery much beyond age 70. Only about a quarter of men had an individualized benefit within even 50% of the mean. A limitation is that estimates from SPCG-4 have to be applied cautiously to contemporary patients.  Conclusions:   Our model suggests that it is hard to justify surgery in patients with Gleason 6, T1 disease or in those patients much above 70 yr of age. Conversely, surgery seems unequivocally of benefit for patients who have Gleason 8, or Gleason 7, stage T2. For patients with Gleason 6 T2 and Gleason 7 T1, treatment is more of a judgment call, depending on patient preference and other clinical findings, such as the number of positive biopsy cores and comorbidities.""","""['Andrew Vickers', 'Caroline Bennette', 'Gunnar Steineck', 'Hans-Olov Adami', 'Jan-Erik Johansson', 'Anna Bill-Axelson', 'Juni Palmgren', 'Hans Garmo', 'Lars Holmberg']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Radical prostatectomy: yes or no?

Prostate cancer is generally considered to be high risk when the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) concentration is >20 ng/mL, the Gleason score is ≥8 or the American Joint Commission on Cancer (AJCC) tumour (T) category is ≥2c. There is no consensus on the best treatment for men with prostate cancer that includes these high-risk features. Options include external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) with androgen suppression therapy (AST), treatment with a combination of brachytherapy, EBRT and AST termed combined-modality therapy (CMT) or radical prostatectomy (RP) followed by adjuvant RT in cases where there are unfavourable pathological features, e.g. positive surgical margin, extracapsular extension and seminal vesicle invasion. While outcomes for both approaches have been published independently these treatments have not been compared in the setting of a prospective RCT where confounding factors related to patient selection for RP or CMT would be minimised. These factors include age, known prostate cancer prognostic factors and comorbidity. RCTs that compare RP to radiation-based regimens have been attempted but failed to accrue.  Objective:   To assess the risk of prostate cancer-specific mortality after therapy with radical prostatectomy (RP) or combined-modality therapy (CMT) with brachytherapy, external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) and androgen-suppression therapy (AST) in men with Gleason score 8-10 prostate cancer.  Patients and methods:   Men with localised high-risk prostate cancer based on a Gleason score of 8-10 were selected for study from Duke University (285 men), treated between January 1988 and October 2008 with RP or from the Chicago Prostate Cancer Center or within the 21st Century Oncology establishment (372) treated between August 1991 and November 2005 with CMT. Fine and Gray multivariable regression was used to assess whether the risk of prostate cancer-specific mortality differed after RP as compared with CMT adjusting for age, cardiac comorbidity and year of treatment, and known prostate cancer prognostic factors.  Results:   As of January 2009, with a median (interquartile range) follow-up of 4.62 (2.4-8.2) years, there were 21 prostate cancer-specific deaths. Treatment with RP was not associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer-specific mortality compared with CMT (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.8, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.6-5.6, P = 0.3). Factors associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer-specific mortality were a PSA concentration of <4 ng/mL (adjusted HR 6.1, 95% CI 2.3-16, P < 0.001) as compared with ≥4 ng/mL, and clinical category T2b, c (adjusted HR 2.9; 95% CI 1.1-7.2; P = 0.03) as compared with T1c, 2a.

There are only a few studies and no consensus concerning the relationship between LUTS and prostate cancer. This paper focuses on 2353 men with an elevated PSA level within the Gothenburg Randomized Screening Trial who underwent biopsy and answered questions regarding LUTS. The main conclusion was that the absence of voiding symptoms is an independent risk factor for prostate cancer detection.  Objective:   To investigate whether men with obstructive voiding symptoms are at increased risk for being diagnosed with prostate cancer within the Gothenburg randomized population-based prostate cancer screening trial.  Subjects and methods:   In 1995, 20 000 men born between 1930 and 1944 were randomly selected from the population register and randomized to either a screening group (10 000), invited for total prostate-specific antigen (tPSA) testing every second year until they reached an upper age-limit pending between 67 and 71 years, or to a control group not invited (10 000). Men with a PSA concentration of ≥3.0 ng/mL were offered further examination with prostate biopsies. Immediately before the physician's examination a self-administered, study-specific questionnaire was completed including one question concerning obstructive voiding symptoms. Multivariate logistic regression modelling was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) for associations of age, tPSA, free/total PSA (f/tPSA) ratio, prostate volume and the presence of voiding symptoms in prostate cancer risk. A P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.  Results:   Between 1995 and 2010 there were 2590 men who had an elevated PSA concentration (≥3.0 ng/mL) at least once during the study. Of these, 2353 men (91%) accepted further clinical examination with transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS) and prostate biopsies. In all, 633/2353 men had prostate cancer (27%) on biopsy and 1720/2353 men (73%) had a benign pathology. Men with prostate cancer reported a lower frequency of voiding symptoms (24% vs 31%, P < 0.001), independent of age and locally advanced tumours (T2b-T4). In the multivariate logistic regression model increasing age and tPSA were positively associated with prostate cancer while prostate volume, f/tPSA ratio and the presence of voiding symptoms were all inversely associated with the risk of detecting prostate cancer in a screening setting. This inverse association of voiding symptoms and prostate cancer detection was restricted to men with large prostates (>37.8 mL); 15% in men with voiding symptoms vs 22% in asymptomatic men (P < 0.001).  Conclusion:   The presence of voiding symptoms should not be a decision tool for deciding which men with an elevated PSA concentration should be offered biopsies of the prostate.""","""['Maria Frånlund', 'Sigrid Carlsson', 'Johan Stranne', 'Gunnar Aus', 'Jonas Hugosson']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Population-based screening for prostate cancer by measuring free and total serum prostate-specific antigen in Sweden.', 'Utility of digital rectal examination, serum prostate specific antigen, and transrectal ultrasound in the detection of prostate cancer: a developing country perspective.', 'Complexed prostate-specific antigen for early detection of prostate cancer in men with serum prostate-specific antigen levels of 2 to 4 nanograms per milliliter.', 'Screening for prostate cancer: an update.', 'Prostate Cancer in Primary Care.', 'Urinary symptoms and prostate cancer-the misconception that may be preventing earlier presentation and better survival outcomes.', 'Identifying Prostate Cancer Among Men with Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms.', 'The relationship between overactive bladder and prostate cancer: A scoping review.', 'Contemporary outcomes in the detection of\xa0prostate cancer using transrectal ultrasound-guided 12-core biopsy in Singaporean men with elevated prostate specific antigen and/or abnormal\xa0digital rectal examination.', 'Absence of Bladder Outlet Obstruction Is an Independent Risk Factor for Prostate Cancer in Men Undergoing Prostate Biopsy.']"""

We postulate similar effects in castration-resistant prostate cancer because it exhibits a lipogenic phenotype. Nelfinavir inhibited androgen receptor activation in androgen-sensitive prostate cancer and the nuclear translocation of the fusion proteins sterol regulatory element binding protein-1 (SREBP-1)-enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6)-EGFP in castration-resistant prostate cancer cells, viewed under confocal microscopy. Nelfinavir and site-1 protease (S1P) and S2P small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) reduced the proliferation of castration-resistant prostate cancer and induced apoptosis, which was opposed by autophagy. Inhibition of autophagy with hydroxychloroquine was additive to the apoptotic effect of nelfinavir. Western blotting of S1P and S2P siRNA knockdown and/or nelfinavir-treated cells confirmed the accumulation of precursor SREBP-1 and ATF6. 3,4-Dichloroisocoumarin, an S1P inhibitor, did not affect SREBP-1 processing. In contrast, 1,10-phenanthroline, an S2P inhibitor, reproduced the nelfinavir-treated molecular and biological phenotype. Nelfinavir-mediated inhibition of regulated intramembrane proteolysis led to the accumulation of unprocessed SREBP-1 and ATF6. This resulted in sequential endoplasmic reticulum stress, inhibition of the unfolded protein response, reduced fatty acid synthase expression and apoptosis, which was countered by autophagy. Inhibition of autophagy was at least additive to this pro-apoptotic effect. These findings provide new insights into nelfinavir-induced endoplasmic reticulum stress and cancer cell death, and lead us to propose investigating its clinical activity in castration-resistant prostate cancer.

What's known on the subject? and What does the study add? With the increased use of laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (LRP) and robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP), a growing number of publications have sought to compare these more advanced techniques to retropubic RP (RRP). Many studies have found RALP and LRP to be associated with lower blood loss, postoperative pain, and hospital stay when compared with RRP. The present study showed that, after adjusting for potential confounders, patients undergoing RALP had a lower risk of 90-day re-admission than patients undergoing RRP. However, there was no significant difference in the odds of being re-admitted ≤ 90 days after RP between patients undergoing a LRP and RRP.  Objective:   • To examine the risk of 90-day re-admission among patients undergoing retropubic radical prostatectomy (RRP), laparoscopic RP (LRP), and robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP) in Taiwan.  Patients and methods:   • We identified 2741 hospitalised patients who underwent a RP. Of these 2741 cases, 1773 patients underwent RRP, 694 LRP, and 274 RALP. • We performed a conditional (fixed-effect) logistic regression model to explore the odds of 90-day re-admission from RP among patients undergoing RRP, LRP, and RALP.  Results:   • In all, 257 of the 2741 (9.4%) sampled subjects were re-admitted ≤ 90 days of the index RP. • Patients undergoing a RALP had a significantly lower incidence rate of 90-day re-admission than patients undergoing a RRP or LRP (3.6% vs 10.7% vs 8.2%, P < 0.001). • Compared with patients undergoing a RRP, the odds ratio (OR) of 90-day re-admission for patients undergoing a RALP was only 0.35 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.19-0.68) after adjusting for patient age, geographic region, year of surgery, Charlson Co-morbidity Index score, and surgeon age and the number of RP cases/year. • However, there was no significant difference in the odds of being re-admitted ≤ 90 days of RP between patients undergoing a LRP and RRP. • The adjusted odds of 90-day re-admission for patients undergoing a RALP were 0.46 (95% CI 0.23-0.94) those of patients undergoing a LRP.

To circumvent these limitations, we have synthesized EM011-cyclodextrin inclusion complexes to improve solubility and enhance therapeutic index of EM011. Phase solubility analysis indicated that EM011 formed a 1:1 stoichiometric complex with β-CD and methyl-β-CD, with a stability constant (K(c)) of 2.42 × 10(-3) M and 4.85 × 10(-3) M, respectively. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy suggested the penetrance of either a O-CH(2) or OCH(3)-C(6)H(4)-OCH(3) moiety of EM011 in the β-CD or methyl-β-CD cavity. In addition, multifarious techniques, namely, differential scanning calorimetry, powder X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, NMR spectroscopy, and computational studies validated the cage complex of EM011 with β-CD and methyl-β-CD. Moreover, rotating frame overhauser enhancement spectroscopy showed that the H(a) proton of the OCH(3)-C(6)H(4)-OCH(3) moiety was in close proximity with H3 proton of the β-CD or methyl-β-CD cavity. Furthermore, we found that the solubility of EM011 in phosphate buffer saline (pH 7.4) was enhanced by ~11 fold and ~21 fold upon complexation with β-CD and methyl-β-CD, respectively. The enhanced dissolution of the drug CD-complexes in aqueous phase remarkably decreased their IC(50) to 28.5 μM (9-Br-Nos-β-CD) and 12.5 μM (9-Br-Nos-methyl-β-CD) in PC-3 cells compared to free EM011 (~200 μM).

Previously, it has been reported that PSA may not perform as accurately as PSA density (PSAD) in predicting outcomes after radical prostatectomy among patients with Gleason score 6 prostate cancer. However, there have been few studies comparing the usefulness of PSA and PSAD in predicting upgrading after surgery. Also, most published studies on the prediction of upgrading included significant proportions of subjects who did not undergo contemporary multicore prostate biopsy. Moreover, most studies from major academic centres on the potential usefulness of PSAD as a preoperative predictor of pathological and/or biochemical outcomes after surgery have not included detailed biopsy core-related data. Even when accounting for detailed biopsy core data, this study found that PSAD may be a significantly more accurate preoperative predictor of upgrading than PSA in the current era of extended prostate biopsies. This finding supports the inclusion of PSAD into the risk stratification system for patients with prostate cancer seeking less invasive treatment, such as active surveillance.  Objective:   • To compare the accuracies of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and PSA density (PSAD) in predicting Gleason score upgrading after radical prostatectomy (RP) in men who have undergone contemporary multicore prostate biopsy and for whom detailed biopsy core data are available.  Patients and methods:   • We analysed prospectively collected data on 505 patients who were diagnosed with Gleason 6 prostate cancer after multicore (≥ 12 cores) biopsy and who underwent RP without neoadjuvant treatment. • Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to analyse the predictive accuracies of multivariate logistic regression models.  Results:   • When multivariate models were constructed incorporating either PSA or PSAD along with other upgrading predictors, including biopsy core, both PSA and PSAD were observed to be independent predictors of upgrading in all versions of models (all P < 0.05). • When predictive accuracies of multivariate models including PSA and PSAD were compared, the PSAD model was found to have significantly higher accuracy than the PSA model in three out of four versions of models analysed (model 1, P= 0.048; model 2, P= 0.002; model 3, P= 0.201; model 4, P= 0.044).  Conclusion:   • According to our analysis of prospectively collected data, PSAD may be a significantly more accurate preoperative predictor of upgrading than PSA, even when accounting for detailed biopsy core data in the current era of extended prostate biopsies. • Our findings would support the inclusion of PSAD, rather than PSA, into the risk stratification system for patients seeking less invasive treatment for prostate cancer.""","""['Jong Jin Oh', 'Sung Kyu Hong', 'Jung Keun Lee', 'Byung Ki Lee', 'Sangchul Lee', 'Oh Sung Kwon', 'Seok-Soo Byun', 'Sang Eun Lee']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['The ability of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) density to predict an upgrade in Gleason score between initial prostate biopsy and prostatectomy diminishes with increasing tumour grade due to reduced PSA secretion per unit tumour volume.', 'Unilateral positive biopsies in low risk prostate cancer patients diagnosed with extended transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy schemes do not predict unilateral prostate cancer at radical prostatectomy.', 'Clinical and pathologic predictors of Gleason sum upgrading in patients after radical prostatectomy: results from a single institution series.', 'Contemporary grading for prostate cancer: implications for patient care.', 'Risk factors for Gleason Score upgrading following radical prostatectomy.', 'Determination of Whether Apex or Non-Apex Prostate Cancer Is the Best Candidate for the Use of Prostate-Specific Antigen Density to Predict Pathological Grade Group Upgrading and Upstaging after Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Combining prostate-specific antigen density with prostate imaging reporting and data system score version 2.1 to improve detection of clinically significant prostate cancer: A retrospective study.', 'From Cognitive MR-Targeted Fusion Prostate Biopsy to Radical Prostatectomy: Incidence and Predictors of Gleason Grade Group Upgrading in a Chinese Cohort.', 'Predictors of upgrading from low-grade cancer at prostatectomy in men with biparametric magnetic resonance imaging.', 'CRMP4 CpG Hypermethylation Predicts Upgrading to Gleason Score ≥ 8 in Prostate Cancer.']"""

We have developed polymeric nanoparticles (NPs), based on poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid), that provide sustained intracellular delivery of plasmid DNA, resulting in sustained gene expression without vector-associated toxicity. Our previous studies with p53 gene-loaded NPs (p53NPs) demonstrated sustained antiproliferative effects in cancer cells in vitro. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of p53NPs in vivo. Tumor xenografts in mice were established with human p53-null prostate cancer cells. Animals were treated with p53NPs by either local (intratumoral injection) or systemic (intravenous) administration. Controls included saline, p53 DNA alone, and control NPs. Mice treated with local injections of p53NPs demonstrated significant tumor inhibition and improved animal survival compared with controls. Tumor inhibition corresponded to sustained and greater p53 gene and protein expression in tumors treated with p53NPs than with p53 DNA alone. A single intravenous dose of p53NPs was successful in reducing tumor growth and improving animal survival, although not to the same extent as with local injections. Imaging studies showed that NPs accumulate in tumor tissue after intravenous injection; however, further improvement in tumor targeting efficiency of p53NPs may be needed for better outcome. In conclusion, the NP-mediated p53 gene therapy is effective in tumor growth inhibition.

In the present study, we explored the therapeutically chemosensitizing effect of β-elemene on cisplatin anti-tumour efficacy in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells as well as the underlying mechanism. β-Elemene significantly increased cisplatin cytotoxicity in the androgen-independent prostate carcinoma cell lines DU145 and PC-3. In addition, β-elemene markedly promoted cisplatin-induced apoptotic cell death in both cell lines, as determined by three different apoptosis assays. β-Elemene augmented the cisplatin-induced activation of caspase-3/7/10 and caspase-9, cleavage of caspase-3 and -9, suppression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-X(L) expression, and release of cytochrome c from mitochondria in these cells. Thus, β-elemene enhancement of cisplatin-induced apoptosis via mitochondrial activation of the caspase-mediated apoptotic pathway may account for the augmented anti-cancer potency of cisplatin in prostate cancer.

Patients and methods:   We conducted a prospective study in the urology department of Aristide Le-Dantec hospital (Dakar) between January 2008 and June 2010 (30 months). It included 84 cases of prostate cancer treated by bilateral pulpectomy under local anesthesia.  Results:   The mean age of patients was 72.17±12.48 years (53-91). The median PSA level was 101 ng/mL (12.18-9990). Metastasis have been detected in 75% of cases. The Gleason score was higher than 7 in 40 patients (47.6%). Three months after pulpectomy, an improvement of performance status was seen in 76 patients (90.4%). The back pain significantly decreased in intensity or disappeared in 65.3% (32/49) of cases. A complete recovery of lower limbs motor deficit was observed in 50% of cases (7/14). The PSA levels decreased in 57 of the 76 patients alive and the mean PSA level was then 72±11.7 ng/mL (3.8-2433). At six months, of the 53 patients in urinary retention, 18 had recovered spontaneous and complete urination. The PSA level was below 4 ng/mL in 33.8% (22/65) of cases and between 4 and 10 ng/mL in 52.3% (34/65) of cases. At 12 months, the median PSA nadir was 0.76 ng/mL (0,002-8,17) and 57.4% of the 54 patients alive had a PSA nadir less than 2 ng/mL. The mean follow-up was 11.08±10.34 months (1-30). A rising PSA occurred in 17 patients (20.2%) after an mean progression-free survival of 10.5 months (6-25). The overall survival at 6, 12 and 24 months were respectively 77.3, 64.3 and 52.3%. The overall cost of pulpectomy was 50 000 FCFA (76€). The specific morbidity of pulpectomy was two cases (2.4%) of infection of the operative site.  Conclusion:   The bilateral pulpectomy was a method of androgen suppression immediately effective, efficacious with a low morbidity. Its very low cost is the main reason why it is still the most used method in our country.""","""['B Fall', 'K Tengue', 'Y Sow', 'A Sarr', 'A Thiam', 'S Mohamed', 'B Diao', 'P A Fall', 'A K Ndoye', 'M Ba', 'B A Diagne']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Prog Urol""","""['Predictors of androgen independence in metastatic prostate cancer.', ""High-dose-rate intensity-modulated brachytherapy with external beam radiotherapy for prostate cancer: California endocurietherapy's 10-year results."", 'PSA nadir predicts biochemical and distant failures after external beam radiotherapy for prostate cancer: a multi-institutional analysis.', 'Prostate-cancer-specific survival and clinical progression-free survival in men with prostate cancer treated intermittently with testosterone-inactivating pharmaceuticals.', 'PSA and follow-up after treatment of prostate cancer.', 'Impact of tumor cytoreduction in metastatic prostate cancer.']"""

In the particular case of the cancer of prostate, a hypofractionned protocol allows to deliver an equivalent radiobiological dose identical even higher than a standard plan of irradiation. The hypofractionation is presented as a solution to improve the access to the care (fewer processing times by patient, more patients treated by machine) while increasing the quality of the care: better carcinologic control, less radiotoxicity. The objective of this article is to make a clarification on the hypofractionned radiotherapy in first intention in the treatment of the localized prostate cancer. We count three studies on large cohorts, comparing standard plans to 1.8-2 Gy/session and hypofractionned plans (2.5-3 Gy/session). The inferior carcinologic results of the two first comparative studies with regard to the study of phase I/II of the Cleveland clinic were owed to a sub-dosage of hypofractionned plans. The administered equivalent biological doses were lower than the at present recommended total doses and lower than the theoretical doses, calculated on the bases of an erroneous evaluation of the radiosensibility of the prostate cancer. In the comparative study of Arcangeli, the rate of survival without biological recurrence in 4 years (82%) was significantly to the advantage of the hypofractionned group, while reducing the duration of treatment of 3 weeks. Four comparative studies reported aigues/late toxicity, gastrointestinal (GI)/genito-urinary acceptable (GU) even lower with a hypofractionned plan. The hypofractionation is potentially the future of the radiotherapy in the treatment of the localized prostate cancer thanks to the technological innovation, but for all that does not constitute at present a standard.""","""['R Boissier', 'E Gross']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Prog Urol""","""['Hypofractionated versus conventionally fractionated radiotherapy for patients with prostate cancer (HYPRO): late toxicity results from a randomised, non-inferiority, phase 3 trial.', 'Hypofractionated versus conventionally fractionated radiotherapy for patients with prostate cancer (HYPRO): acute toxicity results from a randomised non-inferiority phase 3 trial.', 'Hypofractionated versus conventionally fractionated radiotherapy for patients with localised prostate cancer (HYPRO): final efficacy results from a randomised, multicentre, open-label, phase 3 trial.', 'Hypofractionated Radiotherapy for Localized Prostate Cancer: A Challenging Accelerated Hypofractionated Radiotherapy.', 'Intensity-modulated radiotherapy for the treatment of prostate cancer: a systematic review and economic evaluation.']"""

The AD cohort contained 24,066 patients with each patient randomly frequency matched according to age and sex with 4 individuals from the general population without AD. Cox's proportional hazard regression analysis was conducted to estimate the influence of AD on the risk of cancer.  Results:   Among patients with AD, the overall risk of developing cancer was only 1% higher than among subjects without AD, and the difference was not significant (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.01, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] = 0.95-1.07). With regard to individual types of cancer, the risk of developing prostate cancer among male patients with AD was significantly higher (HR = 1.32, 95% CI = 1.02-1.71). On the other hand, the risk of cervical cancer among female patients with AD was marginally significantly lower than among female subjects without AD (HR = 0.72, 95% CI = 0.51-1.03).  Limitations:   One major limitation is the lack of information regarding the life style or behavior of patients in the NHI database, such as smoking and alcohol consumption.

Two polymorphisms located in the MDM2 promoter P2 have been shown to affect cancer risk. One of these polymorphisms (SNP309T>G; rs2279744) facilitates Sp1 transcription factor binding to the promoter and is associated with increased cancer risk. In contrast, SNP285G>C (rs117039649), located 24 bp upstream of rs2279744, and in complete linkage disequilibrium with the SNP309G allele, reduces Sp1 recruitment and lowers cancer risk. Thus, fine tuning of MDM2 expression has proven to be of significant importance with respect to tumorigenesis. We assessed the potential functional effects of a third MDM2 promoter P2 polymorphism (SNP344T>A; rs1196333) located on the SNP309T allele.

Molecular understanding of metastasis-associated drug resistance remains elusive due to the scarcity of available tumor tissue. Isolation of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) from the peripheral blood of patients has emerged as a valid alternative source of tumor tissue that can be subjected to molecular characterization. However, issues with low purity and sensitivity have impeded adoption to clinical practice. Here we report a novel method to capture and molecularly characterize CTCs isolated from castrate-resistant prostate cancer patients (CRPC) receiving taxane chemotherapy. We have developed a geometrically enhanced differential immunocapture (GEDI) microfluidic device that combines an anti-prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) antibody with a 3D geometry that captures CTCs while minimizing nonspecific leukocyte adhesion. Enumeration of GEDI-captured CTCs (defined as intact, nucleated PSMA+/CD45- cells) revealed a median of 54 cells per ml identified in CRPC patients versus 3 in healthy donors. Direct comparison with the commercially available CellSearch® revealed a 2-400 fold higher sensitivity achieved with the GEDI device. Confocal microscopy of patient-derived GEDI-captured CTCs identified the TMPRSS2:ERG fusion protein, while sequencing identified specific androgen receptor point mutation (T868A) in blood samples spiked with only 50 PC C4-2 cells. On-chip treatment of patient-derived CTCs with docetaxel and paclitaxel allowed monitoring of drug-target engagement by means of microtubule bundling. CTCs isolated from docetaxel-resistant CRPC patients did not show any evidence of drug activity. These measurements constitute the first functional assays of drug-target engagement in living circulating tumor cells and therefore have the potential to enable longitudinal monitoring of target response and inform the development of new anticancer agents.""","""['Brian J Kirby', 'Mona Jodari', 'Matthew S Loftus', 'Gunjan Gakhar', 'Erica D Pratt', 'Chantal Chanel-Vos', 'Jason P Gleghorn', 'Steven M Santana', 'He Liu', 'James P Smith', 'Vicente N Navarro', 'Scott T Tagawa', 'Neil H Bander', 'David M Nanus', 'Paraskevi Giannakakou']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Capture of circulating tumor cells from whole blood of prostate cancer patients using geometrically enhanced differential immunocapture (GEDI) and a prostate-specific antibody.', 'Androgen receptor nuclear localization correlates with AR-V7 mRNA expression in circulating tumor cells (CTCs) from metastatic castration resistance prostate cancer patients.', 'Isolation of circulating tumor cells using a microvortex-generating herringbone-chip.', 'Circulating tumor cells as biomarkers in prostate cancer.', 'In vitro models of the metastatic cascade: from local invasion to extravasation.', 'On-chip modeling of tumor evolution: Advances, challenges and opportunities.', 'Role of Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition for the Generation of Circulating Tumors Cells and Cancer Cell Dissemination.', 'Circulating Tumor Cells in Colorectal Cancer: Detection Systems and Clinical Utility.', 'Polycarboxybetaine-Based Hydrogels for the Capture and Release of Circulating Tumor Cells.', 'The Tumor Microenvironment: An Introduction to the Development of Microfluidic Devices.']"""

The aim of this study was to compare the learning curves of two surgeons with different surgical experiences.  Methods:   A prospective collection of peri-operative data was made: age, body mass index, PSA, clinical stage, biopsy Gleason score, operative time (OT), blood loss (BL), pathological stages, final Gleason scores, and complications. Patients were included, in two groups. The first group comprised the first 100 patients undergoing RARP by an expert laparoscopic surgeon. The second group of 100 patients was operated on by a junior surgeon without robotic console experience. Post-operative complications were defined according to the Clavien grading system for surgical morbidity  Results:   For groups 1 and 2 median age was 63 and 62 years, respectively; median pre-operative PSA level was 10 and 8, respectively; the median BMI was 24 and 25, respectively. The median operative time (OT) was 179 and 160 min, respectively (p > 0.05); and median blood loss was 217 and 346 ml, respectively (p = 0.04). The overall transfusion rate was 1.5% and two major complications were recorded in group 1 and four in group 2.  Conclusions:   RARP is safe and reproducible even during the initial learning curve. Overcoming the learning curve is multifactorial and is necessarily dependent on the surgeon. However, joining a well-trained team probably affects positively the performance of the surgeon.

Therefore, BM maintenance represents a barrier against cancer development and progression. In the study, we show that miR-205 participates in a network involving ΔNp63α, which is essential for maintenance of the BM in prostate epithelium. At the molecular level, ΔNp63α is able to enhance miR-205 transcription by binding to its promoter, whereas the microRNA can post-transcriptionally limit the amount of ΔNp63α protein, mostly by affecting ΔNp63α proteasomal degradation rather than through a canonical miRNA/target interaction. Functionally, miR-205 is able to control the deposition of laminin-332 and its receptor integrin-β4. Hence, pathological loss of miR-205, as widely observed in prostate cancer, may favor tumorigenesis by creating discontinuities in the BM.

We studied the influence of focal and diffuse extraprostatic extension and positive surgical margins on biochemical progression using a simple method for quantification.  Materials and methods:   A total of 360 prostates were step-sectioned and totally processed from 175 patients with stage T1c and 185 patients with clinical stage T2 submitted to radical retropubic prostatectomy. Extraprostatic extension was stratified into 2 groups: present up to 1 quadrant and/or section from the bladder neck or apex (Group 1, focal) and in more than 1 quadrant or section (Group 2, diffuse); and, positive surgical margin present up to 2 quadrants and/or sections (Group 1, focal) and in more than 2 quadrants or sections (Group 2, diffuse). The Kaplan-Meier product-limit analysis was used for the time to biochemical recurrence, and an univariate and multivariate Cox stepwise logistic regression model to identify significant predictors.  Results:   Extraprostatic extension was found in 129/360 (35.8%) patients, 39/129 (30.2%) in Group 1 and 90/129 (69.8%) in Group 2. In univariate analysis but not in multivariate analysis, patients showing diffuse extraprostatic extension (Group 2) had a significant higher risk to develop biochemical recurrence in a shorter time. Positive surgical margin was present in 160/360 (44.4%) patients, 81/160 (50.6%) patients in Group 1 and 79/160 (49.4%) patients in Group 2.

The purpose of this study was to investigate whether MMP-2 and its specifi c regulators, TIMP-2, MT1-MMP and IL-8, are expressed in a reproducible, specific pattern and if the profiles are related to prognosis and clinical outcome of prostate cancer (PCa).  Materials and methods:   MMP-2, TIMP-2, MT1-MMP and IL-8 expression levels were analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) in freshly frozen malignant and benign tissue specimens collected from 79 patients with clinically localized PCa who underwent radical prostatectomies. The control group consisted of 11 patients with benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH). The expression profile of the MMP-2 and its regulators were compared using Gleason scores, pathological stage, pre-operative PSA levels and the fi nal outcome of the PCa.  Results:   The analysis of 79 specimens of PCa revealed that MMP-2, TIMP-2, MT1-MMP and IL-8 were underexpressed at 60.0%, 72.2%, 62.0% and 65.8%, respectively, in malignant prostatic tissue in relation to BPH samples. Considering the prognostic parameters, we demonstrated that high Gleason score tumors (≥ 7) overexpressed MMP-2 (p = 0.048) and TIMP-2 (p = 0.021), compared to low Gleason score tumors (< 7).  Conclusion:   We have demonstrated that MMP-2 and its regulators are underexpressed in PCa. Alternatively, overexpression of MMP-2 and TIMP-2 was related to higher Gleason score tumors.

Materials and methods:   A total of 1,082 physicians affiliated to the Sao Paulo Section of the Brazilian Society of Urology were invited to participate in this cross-sectional, web-based survey. Between September 2004 and September 2005, participating urologists entered data on demographic, clinical and pathological characteristics of patients diagnosed with prostate cancer in their practice. Data on patients attended at public institutions were analyzed and compared with those patients attended at private practice.  Results:   One hundred and ten society members contributed with data from 1915 patients, 1026 (53.6%) of whom from public institutions. When compared with patients attended at private institutions, those attended at public institutions were older and more likely to be black, had higher serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels, had a higher probability of being diagnosed with metastatic disease, but were less likely to undergo prostatectomy (all P < 0.001). In multivariate analysis, age, biopsy Gleason score, and being attended at a public institution were independently associated with metastatic disease upon diagnosis. The significant predictors of nonsurgical treatment were age, black race, and higher serum levels of PSA.

Prostate equivalent rotation is a new metric introduced in this study to quantify prostate rotations by accounting for prostate shape and length of rotational lever arm.  Results:   Large variations in prostate delivered dose were seen among patients. Adequate target coverage was met in 39%, 65%, and 84% of the patients for plans with 2-, 3-, and 5-mm PTV margins, respectively. Although no correlations between prostate delivered dose and daily rotations were seen, the data showed a clear correlation with prostate equivalent rotation.

Established clinicopathologic parameters such as Gleason score, T stage, and prostate-specific antigen levels are currently the guiding tools for prognostication and disease management. The addition of biomarkers could increase the accuracy of these parameters for predicting disease progression, response to therapy, and survival. In this regard, the goal of this study was to evaluate minichromosome maintenance complex protein 2 and Ki-67 immunohistochemical expression as predictors of outcome in prostate cancer. For this purpose, 11 tissue microarrays were constructed using tumor and nontumor samples from 428 patients. Patients were divided into short-term (mean, 2.9 years) and long-term (mean, 14.1 years) follow-up groups. End points were biochemical recurrence for the short-term follow-up group and prostate cancer-related death for the long-term follow-up group. All men in the long-term follow-up group had biochemical recurrence at the time of recruitment. Expression of both markers was higher in tumor than in nontumor glands. Percentage of minichromosome maintenance complex protein 2 was associated with Gleason score in both groups. Percentage of Ki-67 was associated with Gleason score and pathologic stage only in the short-term follow-up group. Higher minichromosome maintenance complex protein 2 percentages were associated with biochemical recurrence in the short-term follow-up group. In the long-term follow-up group, neither minichromosome maintenance complex protein 2 nor Ki-67 levels predicted prostate cancer death.

Methods:   The anti-angiogenic effects of IDR-E804 were examined by assessing the proliferation, migration and capillary tube formation of HUVECs were induced by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) with or without various concentrations of IDR-E804. The inhibitory effect of IDR-E804 angiogenesis and tumor growth in vivo was also investigated in Balb/c mice subcutaneously transplanted with CT-26 colon cancer cells.  Results:   IDR-E804 significantly decreased proliferation, migration and tube formation of vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF-treated HUVECs. These effects were accompanied by decreased phosphorylation of VEGF receptor (VEGFR)-2, AKT and extracellular signal regulated kinase in VEGF-treated HUVECs. Intratumor injections of IDR-E804 inhibited the growth of subcutaneously inoculated CT-26 allografts in syngenic mice. Immunohistochemistry revealed a decreased CD31 microvessel density index and Ki-67 proliferative index, but an increased apoptosis index in IDR-E804-treated tumors.

In the search for markers of metastasis and more effective therapies, the tumor metabolome is relevant because of its importance to the malignant phenotype and metastatic capacity of tumor cells. Altered choline metabolism is a hallmark of cancer. More specifically, a decreased glycerophosphocholine (GPC) to phosphocholine (PC) ratio was reported in breast, ovarian, and prostate cancers. Improved strategies to exploit this altered choline metabolism are therefore required. However, the critical enzyme cleaving GPC to produce choline, the initial step in the pathway controlling the GPC/PC ratio, remained unknown. In the present work, we have identified the enzyme, here named EDI3 (endometrial differential 3). Purified recombinant EDI3 protein cleaves GPC to form glycerol-3-phosphate and choline. Silencing EDI3 in MCF-7 cells decreased this enzymatic activity, increased the intracellular GPC/PC ratio, and decreased downstream lipid metabolites. Downregulating EDI3 activity inhibited cell migration via disruption of the PKCα signaling pathway, with stable overexpression of EDI3 showing the opposite effect. EDI3 was originally identified in our screening study comparing mRNA levels in metastasizing and nonmetastasizing endometrial carcinomas. Both Kaplan-Meier and multivariate analyses revealed a negative association between high EDI3 expression and relapse-free survival time in both endometrial (P < 0.001) and ovarian (P = 0.029) cancers. Overall, we have identified EDI3, a key enzyme controlling GPC and choline metabolism.

In this study, the GRPR-targeting potential of (18)F-labeled NOTA-8-Aoc-BBN(7-14)NH(2) was studied using (68)Ga-NOTA-8-Aoc-BBN(7-14)NH(2) as a reference.

The labeled product was purified by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. The log P values of the radiotracers were determined. The tumor-targeting characteristics of the compounds were assessed in mice with subcutaneously growing PC-3 xenografts. GRPR-binding specificity was studied by coinjection of an excess of unlabeled NOTA-8-Aoc-BBN(7-14)NH(2). Small-animal PET/CT images were acquired.  Results:   NOTA-8-Aoc-BBN(7-14)NH(2) could be efficiently labeled with (18)F or with (68)Ga. NOTA-8-Aoc-BBN(7-14)NH(2) was labeled with (18)F in a single step, with 50%-90% yield.

Results:   The model structure consists of a central exchange compartment (blood), 2 compartments each for the liver and kidneys, 1 for spleen, 1 for urinary bladder, and 1 generic compartment accounting for the remaining material. The model can successfully describe the individual patients' data. The parameters showing the greatest interindividual variations are the blood volume (the clearance process is rapid, and early blood data are not available for several patients) and the transfer out from liver (the physical half-life of (18)F is too short to follow this long-term process with the necessary accuracy). The organs receiving the highest doses are the kidneys (reference patient, 0.079 mGy/MBq; individual values, 0.033-0.105 mGy/MBq) and the liver (reference patient, 0.062 mGy/MBq; individual values, 0.036-0.082 mGy/MBq). The dose to the urinary bladder wall of the reference patient varies between 0.017 and 0.030 mGy/MBq, depending on the assumptions on bladder voiding.  Conclusion:   The model gives a satisfactory description of the biodistribution of (18)F-FCH and realistic estimates of the radiation dose received by the patients.""","""['Augusto Giussani', 'Tilman Janzen', 'Helena Uusijärvi-Lizana', 'Federico Tavola', 'Maria Zankl', 'Marie Sydoff', 'Anders Bjartell', 'Sigrid Leide-Svegborn', 'Marcus Söderberg', 'Sören Mattsson', 'Christoph Hoeschen', 'Marie-Claire Cantone']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""['Biodistribution and radiation dosimetry of deuterium-substituted 18F-fluoromethyl-1, 2-2H4choline in healthy volunteers.', 'Nonlinear compartmental model of 18F-choline.', '18F-Fluorothymidine radiation dosimetry in human PET imaging studies.', 'PET-based radiation dosimetry in man of 18F-fluorodihydrotestosterone, a new radiotracer for imaging prostate cancer.', 'Synthesis and evaluation of (18)F-labeled choline analogs as oncologic PET tracers.', 'A revised compartmental model for biokinetics and dosimetry of 2-18FFDG.', 'Development of a Compartmental Pharmacokinetic Model for Molecular Radiotherapy with 131I-CLR1404.', 'Quantification of internal dosimetry in PET patients II: Individualized Monte Carlo-based dosimetry for 18Ffluorocholine PET.', 'Benefit of 18F-fluorocholine PET imaging in parathyroid surgery.', 'A quantitative evaluation of multiple biokinetic models using an assembled water phantom: A feasibility study.']"""

Methods:   Two hundred eighty-nine newly diagnosed prostate cancer patients were eligible. 123 consented and were randomised to usual care (n = 60) or navigation (n = 63). The intervention involved a 'navigator' guiding the patient in creating a personal question list for a consultation and providing a CD and typed summary of the consultation to patients, the general practitioner and physician. The primary outcome was decisional self efficacy. Secondary outcomes included decisional conflict (DCS) and decisional regret (RS). Measures of mood (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) and adjustment (Mental Adjustment to Cancer Scale) were included to detect potential adverse effects of the intervention.  Results:   ANOVA showed a main effect for the group (F = 7.161, df 1, p = 0.009). Post hoc comparisons showed significantly higher decisional self efficacy in the navigated patients post-consultation and 6 months later. Decisional conflict was lower for navigated patients initially (t = 2.005, df = 105, p = 0.047), not at follow-up (t = 1.969, df = 109, p = 0.052). Regret scores were significantly lower in the navigation group compared to the controls 6 months later (t = -2.130, df = 100, p = 0.036). There was no impact of the intervention on mood or adjustment.  Conclusion:   Compared to control patients, navigated patients were more confident in making decisions about cancer treatment, were more certain they had made the right decision after the consultation and had less regret about their decision 6 months later.

However, registry data also can be used to calculate survival from cancer in the presence of competing risks, which is more clinically relevant.  Methods:   Statistical methods were developed to predict the risk of death from cancer and other causes, as well as natural life expectancy if the patient did not have cancer based on a profile of prognostic factors including characteristics of the cancer, demographic factors, and comorbid conditions. The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program database was used to calculate the risk of dying of cancer. Because the risks of dying of cancer versus other causes are assumed to be independent conditional on the prognostic factors, a wide variety of independent data sources can be used to calculate the risk of death from other causes. Herein, the risk of death from other causes was estimated using SEER and Medicare claims data, and was matched to the closest fitting portion of the US life table to obtain a ""health status-adjusted age.""

A complete ophthalmologic exam, Goldmann visual fields (GVFs), intravenous fluorescein angiography (IVFA), macular and disc optical coherence tomography (OCT), pattern-reversal visual evoked potentials (PVEPs), and flash electroretinograms (ERGs) were performed. On examination, visual acuity was reduced bilaterally. Fundus exam showed juxtapapillary changes (OS > OD) and, in OS, disc pallor, peripheral RPE dropout and whitish retinal discoloration along the arcades. OCTs were normal OU. Cancer-associated retinopathy (CAR) was suspected. A flash ERG was normal OD and markedly reduced and electronegative OS. An IVFA showed bilateral juxtapapillary staining and changes highly suggestive of sequelae of central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) OS , in which a cilioretinal artery existed along the papillomacular bundle. GVFs showed bilateral blind spot enlargement and centrocecal scotomas, and PVEPs were delayed. These findings suggested cancer-associated optic neuropathy (CAON), confirmed by presence of anti-optic nerve autoantibodies (auto-Abs). No anti-retinal auto-Abs were found. CAON is a less common paraneoplastic manifestation than CAR and it is rarely observed in association with prostate cancer. A combination of visual function testing methods permitted the recognition, in this highly unusual case, of the concurrent presence of unilateral ERG changes most likely attributable to CRAO complications in OS, in all likelihood unrelated to CAON, and not to be confused with unilateral CAR.

Several studies have assessed the rearrangement status of the most commonly found ETS rearranged gene ERG, and the less frequent genes, ETV-1, ETV-4, ETV-5, and ELK-4 in primary prostate cancer. However, frequency in metastatic disease is not well investigated. Recently, we have assessed the ERG rearrangement status in both primary and corresponding lymph node metastases and observed that ERG rearrangement in primary prostate cancer transfers into lymph node metastases, suggesting it to be a clonal expansion event during prostate cancer progression. As a continuation, we investigated in this study whether this observation is valid for the less frequent ETS rearranged genes. Using dual-color break-apart fluorescent in situ hybridization assays, we evaluated the status of all less frequent ETS gene rearrangements for the first time on tissue microarrays constructed from a large cohort of 86 patients with prostate cancer and composed of primary and corresponding lymph node metastases, as well as in a second cohort composed of 43 distant metastases. ETV-1, ETV-4, ETV-5, and ELK-4 rearrangements were found in 8 (10%) of 81, 5 (6%) of 85, 1 (1%) of 85, and 2 (2%) of 86 of primary prostate cancer, respectively, and in 6 (8%) of 73, 4 (6%) of 72, 1 (1%) of 75, and 1 (1%) of 78 of corresponding lymph node metastases, respectively.

However, recent data suggest that integrins regulate not only tumor cell proliferation, survival and migration, but may also influence their response to anti-cancer agents. Interestingly, these influences are largely masked by growth of tumor cells in the standard, yet artificial, environment of 2D cell culture, but are readily apparent under 3D in vitro culture conditions and in tumor growth in vivo. We, and others, have recently demonstrated that the β1 integrin subunit controls the growth and invasion of prostate tumor cells in 3D culture conditions. Recently, the importance of integrins has also been demonstrated using tissue specific conditional knockout strategies in transgenic mouse tumor models, where they control primary tumor growth and dictate the site of metastatic spread. Furthermore, integrin-extracellular matrix interactions may modulate the response of tumors to standard chemotherapy agents or radiation.

However, the disease recurs, and this recurrent cancer is referred to as castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Radiotherapy is the treatment of choice; however, in addition to androgen independence, CRPC is often resistant to radiotherapy, making radioresistant CRPC an incurable disease. The molecular mechanisms by which CRPC cells acquire radioresistance are unclear. Androgen receptor (AR)-tyrosine 267 phosphorylation by Ack1 tyrosine kinase (also known as TNK2) has emerged as an important mechanism of CRPC growth. Here, we demonstrate that pTyr(267)-AR is recruited to the ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) enhancer in an Ack1-dependent manner to up-regulate ATM expression. Mice engineered to express activated Ack1 exhibited a significant increase in pTyr(267)-AR and ATM levels. Furthermore, primary human CRPCs with up-regulated activated Ack1 and pTyr(267)-AR also exhibited significant increase in ATM expression. The Ack1 inhibitor AIM-100 not only inhibited Ack1 activity but also was able to suppress AR Tyr(267) phosphorylation and its recruitment to the ATM enhancer. Notably, AIM-100 suppressed Ack1 mediated ATM expression and mitigated the growth of radioresistant CRPC tumors. Thus, our study uncovers a previously unknown mechanism of radioresistance in CRPC, which can be therapeutically reversed by a new synergistic approach that includes radiotherapy along with the suppression of Ack1/AR/ATM signaling by the Ack1 inhibitor, AIM-100.""","""['Kiran Mahajan', 'Domenico Coppola', 'Bhupendra Rawal', 'Y Ann Chen', 'Harshani R Lawrence', 'Robert W Engelman', 'Nicholas J Lawrence', 'Nupam P Mahajan']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""J Biol Chem""","""['Activated Cdc42-associated kinase Ack1 promotes prostate cancer progression via androgen receptor tyrosine phosphorylation.', 'Dasatinib inhibits site-specific tyrosine phosphorylation of androgen receptor by Ack1 and Src kinases.', 'Chronologically modified androgen receptor in recurrent castration-resistant prostate cancer and its therapeutic targeting.', 'ACK1/TNK2 tyrosine kinase: molecular signaling and evolving role in cancers.', 'Shepherding AKT and androgen receptor by Ack1 tyrosine kinase.', 'Epigenetic reprogramming of cell cycle genes by ACK1 promotes breast cancer resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitor.', 'Histone H2A Lys130 acetylation epigenetically regulates androgen production in prostate cancer.', 'ACKnowledging the role of the Activated-Cdc42 associated kinase (ACK) in regulating protein stability in cancer.', 'Domain Architecture of the Nonreceptor Tyrosine Kinase Ack1.', 'Acetylated HOXB13 Regulated Super Enhancer Genes Define Therapeutic Vulnerabilities of Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.']"""

However, a major limitation of state-of-the-art CTC-chips is their inability to characterize the behavior and function of captured CTCs, for example to obtain information on proliferative and invasive properties or, ultimately, tumor re-initiating potential. Although CTCs can be efficiently immunostained with markers reporting phenotype or fate (e.g. apoptosis, proliferation), it has not yet been possible to reliably grow captured CTCs over long periods of time and at single cell level. It is challenging to remove CTCs from a microchip after capture, therefore such analyses should ideally be performed directly on-chip. To address this challenge, we merged CTC capture with three-dimensional (3D) tumor cell culture on the same microfluidic platform. PC3 prostate cancer cells were isolated from spiked blood on a transparent PDMS CTC-chip, encapsulated on-chip in a biomimetic hydrogel matrix (QGel™) that was formed in situ, and their clonal 3D spheroid growth potential was assessed by microscopy over one week in culture.

Unexpectedly, E2A immuno-histochemistry demonstrated increased E2A expression in prostate cancer as compared to normal prostate. Silencing of E2A in prostate cancer cells DU145 and PC3 led to a significant reduction in proliferation due to G1 arrest that was in part mediated by increased CDKN1A(p21) and decreased Id1, Id3 and c-myc. E2A silencing in prostate cancer cell lines also resulted in increased apoptosis due to increased mitochondrial permeability and caspase 3/7 activation.

What's known on the subject? and What does the study add? In clinical practice, we know that it is necessary to identify new biomarkers that can better detect prostate cancer (PC), at the same time as reducing the number of unnecessary biopsies. Recently, studies have suggested that the most relevant clinical scenario in which the prostate cancer antigen 3 (PCA3) score could be used comprises patients with a previous negative prostate biopsy and persistently elevated PSA levels. At the same time, although multiparametric MRI is not currently used as a first approach for diagnosing PC, it can be useful for directing targeted biopsies, especially in those patients with elevated PSA levels and a previous negative TRUS-guided biopsy. Considering all of these aspects, the present study aimed to evaluate the role of multiparametric MRI as an additional diagnostic tool for improving the accuracy of the urinary PCA3 test in patients with increased PSA levels and a previous negative prostate biopsy. Our hypothesis is that the potential value of the PCA3 test as a biomarker for PC diagnosis could be improved by the use of multiparametric MRI in directing prostate biopsy. In the present study, we show that, in cases with a previous negative biopsy and persistently elevated PSA levels submitted to multiparametric MRI to direct biopsies, the sensitivity of the PCA3 test significantly improved (79% vs 68%). However, further larger randomized studies on this combination using a new biomarker and a new imaging modality for PC diagnosis are expected.  Objective:   • To evaluate the role of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as an additional diagnostic tool for improving the accuracy of the urinary prostate cancer antigen 3 (PCA3) test in patients with an increase in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels and a previous negative prostate biopsy.  Patients and methods:   • The present study comprised a prospective randomized study on patients with a previous negative transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS)-guided prostate biopsy and elevated PSA levels. • In total, 180 cases were analyzed, and all were submitted to PCA3 assay. • Patients in group A were submitted to a second random TRUS-guided prostate biopsy, whereas patients in group B were submitted to a multiparametric MRI examination and then to a second TRUS-guided prostate biopsy.  Results:   • At the second biopsy, a histological diagnosis of prostate cancer was found in 26 of 84 cases (30.9%) in group A and in 29 of 84 cases (34.5%) in group B. • In group A, the sensitivity and specificity of the PCA3 score were 68.0% and 74.5% respectively (positive predictive value of 53.1%, negative predictive value of 84.6% and accuracy of 72.6%). • In group B, the sensitivity and specificity of the PCA3 score were 79.3% and 72.7%, respectively (positive predictive value of 60.5%, negative predictive value of 86.9% and accuracy of 75.0%). • For the PCA3 score, the area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve was 0.825 (95% confidence interval, 0.726-0.899) in group A and 0.857 (95% confidence interval, 0.763-0.924) in group B (P < 0.001).

AND WHAT DOES THE STUDY ADD?: Active surveillance is an established management option for patients with favourable-risk prostate cancer. However, about 25-30% of active surveillance patients demonstrate biopsy progression within the first 3-5 years of follow-up. Although several factors, such as the results of the diagnostic and surveillance biopsies, are known to be associated with the risk of progression, our ability to accurately predict this risk remains limited. Our analysis demonstrated that the overall number of positive cores in the diagnostic and first surveillance biopsies is strongly associated with the risk of progression in active surveillance patients. Furthermore, combined results of diagnostic and first surveillance biopsies provide more information about the probability of progression than they do separately. The most important variable affecting the progression-free survival was the overall number of cores positive for cancer. By 3 years of active surveillance, most of the patients who had four positive cores in the diagnostic and surveillance biopsies progressed, while those who had only one positive core had an excellent prognosis. These findings could be used to improve the accuracy of assessments of the prognosis of patients with low-risk prostate cancer and to help them make informed decisions about their treatment.  Objective:   To analyse the prognostic importance of information provided by the diagnostic biopsy, the first surveillance biopsy and a combination thereof to identify active surveillance patients with a particularly high risk of progression.  Materials and methods:   The present study included 161 active surveillance patients who had at least two surveillance biopsies. The first surveillance biopsy was performed within 1 year of the diagnosis. Further surveillance biopsies usually took place every 1-2 years. Progression on the surveillance biopsy was defined as the presence of Gleason 4/5 cancer, > two positive cores or >20% involvement of any core. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to examine the relationship between biopsy characteristics and progression. Three distinct statistical models were built using characteristics of diagnostic biopsies, surveillance biopsies, and a combination thereof. Harrell's c-index was used to quantify the predictive accuracy of each multivariate Cox model.  Results:   The median follow-up was 3.6 years; 46 (28.6%) patients progressed. In multivariate analysis the major factor associated with progression was the number of positive cores. The model based on the combined results of diagnostic and first surveillance biopsies was significantly more predictive than the models based on the individual results of each biopsy. Patients with four positive cores in the diagnostic and first surveillance biopsies had estimated 5-year progression rate of 100%.

Results:   • A biopsy Gleason score of 8-10 had an adjusted hazard ratio (AHR) of 1.56 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04, 2.34; P= 0.03) for a shorter time to testosterone normalization relative to Gleason 6. Specifically, the 51 men with biopsy Gleason score of 8-10 had a median time to testosterone normalization of 17.0 months compared with 22.1 months and 23.8 months for those with biopsy Gleason ≤ 6 and 7, respectively. • Increasing age was significantly associated with a longer duration of testosterone suppression (AHR of 0.95 [95% CI 0.92, 0.97; P < 0.001]) as was a higher baseline PSA (AHR 0.82 [95% CI 0.69, 0.97; P= 0.02]).  Conclusion:   • A biopsy Gleason score of 8-10 was associated with a shorter period of testosterone suppression following 6 months of CAB and RT. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that a factor released from high-grade PCa cells may impact on testosterone production.""","""['Neil E Martin', 'Ming-Hui Chen', 'Paul L Nguyen', 'Clair J Beard', 'Marian J Loffredo', 'Philip W Kantoff', ""Anthony V D'Amico""]""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Prostate-specific antigen response to deferred combined androgen blockade therapy using bicalutamide predicts survival after subsequent oestrogen and docetaxel therapies in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Prostate-cancer-specific survival and clinical progression-free survival in men with prostate cancer treated intermittently with testosterone-inactivating pharmaceuticals.', 'Secondary chemoprevention of localized prostate cancer by short-term androgen deprivation to select indolent tumors suitable for active surveillance: a prospective pilot phase II study.', 'Antiandrogen in prostate cancer.', 'Total androgen blockade.', 'Impact of time to testosterone rebound and comorbidity on the risk of cause-specific mortality in men with unfavorable-risk prostate cancer.', 'Kinetics of testosterone recovery in clinically localized prostate cancer patients treated with radical prostatectomy and subsequent short-term adjuvant androgen deprivation therapy.']"""

Previous reports, with small numbers of patients, have described the problem of incomplete testosterone suppression (>1.1 or 1.7 nmol/L) with LHRH agonists. Various predisposing factors have been suggested: different drug agents and patient factors such as age, pretreatment testosterone levels and weight. Such incomplete testosterone suppression has been shown in one small report to be associated with increased PSA failure rates and in another report in those with metastases, with worse survival. This study used testosterone assays that are more accurate at low levels than those used in most previous reports in a large dataset of 2196 men, and confirmed incomplete testosterone suppression (breakthrough) rates >1.7 nmol/L of 3.4% and >1.1 nmol/L of 6.6%. We showed that younger age was strongly associated with the risk of breakthrough, with a minor effect of increasing body mass index. Repeated breakthroughs were more common (16%) in those who had already had one breakthrough. Interim measures of cancer control (PSA kinetics during LHRH therapy) were inferior in those with a breakthrough, and those with breakthroughs between 1.1 and 1.7 nmol/L had worse long-term biochemical control rates.  Objectives:   • To describe breakthrough rates above castrate levels of testosterone, in a population-based series of men undergoing adjuvant luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist therapy with curative radiation therapy. • To explore the predisposing factors for such breakthroughs and their impact on subsequent outcomes.  Patients and methods:   • All men treated for prostate cancer between 1998 and 2007 with curative radiation in the province of British Columbia, Canada were potentially eligible (n= 11752). Of these, 2196 fulfilled the eligibility criteria. • Serial testosterone measurements were obtained during continuous LHRH therapy. • Breakthrough rates >1.1 nmol/L and >1.7 nmol/L were calculated for each LHRH injection and for each patient course. • Predisposing factors were identified, and early surrogates of oncological outcome (neoadjuvant nadir and post-treatment nadir) were determined.  Results:   • The risk of a breakthrough >1.1 nmol/L was 6.6%, and >1.7 nmol/L was 3.4% per patient course and 5.4% and 2.2% per LHRH injection (inclusive ranges). • Repeated breakthroughs occurred in 16% of patients. • Younger men were more liable to breakthroughs (P < 0.001). • Early PSA kinetic surrogates of cancer control were inferior in those with breakthroughs. • Neither overall biochemical non-evidence of disease (bNED) nor survival were compromised, although subgroup analysis showed inferior 5-year bNED in those with breakthroughs of 1.1-1.7 nmol/L vs those without (58% vs 73%, respectively; P= 0.048).  Conclusions:   • Breakthroughs with LHRH agonists occur occasionally per injection, but occur commonly per patient course of treatment, and adversely affect early surrogate measures of outcome. • The monitoring of testosterone levels during therapy is therefore advised.""","""['Tom Pickles', 'Jeremy Hamm', 'W James Morris', 'William E Schreiber', 'Scott Tyldesley']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['New treatment paradigm for prostate cancer: abarelix initiation therapy for immediate testosterone suppression followed by a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist.', 'Serum testosterone recovery after cessation of long-term luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist in patients with prostate cancer.', 'Determining dosing intervals for luteinizing hormone releasing hormone agonists based on serum testosterone levels: a prospective study.', 'Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonists in the treatment of prostate cancer: a review of their discovery, development, and place in therapy.', 'Gonadotropin-releasing hormone: an update review of the antagonists versus agonists.', 'Methods for Evaluating the Efficacy of Medical Castration: A Systematic Review.', 'Population PK and Semimechanistic PK/PD Modeling and Simulation of Relugolix Effects on Testosterone Suppression in Men with Prostate Cancer.', 'Does Exist a Differential Impact of Degarelix Versus LHRH Agonists on Cardiovascular Safety?

The use of surgical staging has to be balanced against the complications of the procedure, the individual patient's risk for harbouring metastases and the consequences for the treatment of the patient if such metastases are present. The aim of this study was to investigate complications at 90 days using a standardized method (Clavien) in a consecutive series of patients submitted to laparoscopic extended pelvic lymphadenectomy.  Material and methods:   This population-based study included 133 high-risk prostate cancer patients scheduled for external beam radiation. Laparoscopic extended pelvic lymphadenectomy and registration of complications were performed in a standardized fashion. Complications were registered on a five-grade scale, and differences between groups were compared with the chi-squared test.  Results:   The mean hospital stay was 1.3 days. Only three patients (2%) suffered from grade 3 complications after surgery, whereas 35 patients (26%) had grade 1 complications and another 11 patients (8%) were treated for grade 2 complications. Of all patients, 35% had lymph-node metastasis, of whom 50% received intensified oncological treatment including adjuvant androgen deprivation and regional lymph-node radiation. Thus, 65% of the patients could be spared regional lymph-node radiation and its associated long-term toxicity.

In vitro studies have determined several common mutations of Tp53 that have specific gain-of-function properties in addition to loss of function, including the ability to promote castration-resistant (CR) growth of CaP cells in some contexts. To date, a lack of suitable mouse models has prohibited investigation of the role played by Tp53 mutations in mediating CaP progression in vivo. Here, we describe the effects of conditional expression of a mutant Tp53 (Tp53(R270H); equivalent to the human hotspot mutant R273H) in the prostate epithelium of mice. Heterozygous ""Tp53(LSL-R270H/+)"" [129S4(Trp53(tm3Tyj))] and ""Nkx3.1-Cre"" [129S(Nkx3-1(tm3(cre)Mms))] mice with prostate-specific expression of the Tp53(R270H) mutation (p53(R270H/+) Nkx3.1-Cre mice) were bred onto an FVB/N background via speed congenesis to produce strain FVB.129S4(Trp53(tm3Tyj/wt)); FVB.129S(Nkx3-1(tm3(cre)Mms/wt)) and littermate genotype negative control mice. These mutant mice had significantly increased incidences of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) lesions, and these appeared earlier, compared with the Nkx3.1 haploinsufficient (Nkx3.1-Cre het) littermate mice, which did not express the Tp53 mutation. PIN lesions in these mice showed consistent progression and some developed into invasive adenocarcinoma with a high grade, sarcomatoid or epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype. PIN lesions were similar to those seen in PTEN conditional knockout mice, with evidence of AKT activation concomitant with neoplastic proliferation. However, the invasive tumor phenotype is rarely seen in previously described mouse models of prostatic neoplasia. These data indicate that the Tp53(R270H) mutation plays a role in CaP initiation. This finding has not previously been reported.

Methods:   A nationwide clinical cohort of incident prostate cancer, PCBaSe, was linked to the Swedish Prescribed Drug Register. Men with a planned first line monotherapy AA treatment were identified; dosages and extent of off-label treatment were investigated. Cumulative incidence proportions for reasons for drug discontinuation were calculated. Factors potentially influencing adherence were explored using the medical possession ratio based on the individual prescribed daily dose.  Results:   First line monotherapy AA was planned in 4.4 % of all incident cases and in 2.1 % of low risk disease cases. Among 1,406 men prescribed bicalutamide, 1,109 (79 %) received the approved daily dose of 150 mg. Discontinuation reasons differed with disease severity. Off-label, low-dose prescription associated with age above 75 years and disease categorised as low risk was noted in 297 men (21 %). Sixty percent of the men adhered well, i.e. to ≥80 %. Age above 75 years and less severe disease were both negatively associated with adherence.

CAPE has been shown to have antimitogenic, anticarcinogenic, and other beneficial medicinal properties. Many of its effects have been shown to be mediated through its inhibition of NF-κB signaling pathways. We took a systematic approach to uncover the effects of CAPE from hours to days on the signaling networks in human prostate cancer cells. We observed that CAPE dosage dependently suppressed the proliferation of LNCaP, DU-145, and PC-3 human prostate cancer cells. Administration of CAPE by gavage significantly inhibited the tumor growth of LNCaP xenografts in nude mice. Using LNCaP cells as a model system, we examined the effect of CAPE on gene expression, protein signaling, and transcriptional regulatory networks using micro-Western arrays and PCR arrays. We built a model of the impact of CAPE on cell signaling which suggested that it acted through inhibition of Akt-related protein signaling networks. Overexpression of Akt1 or c-Myc, a downstream target of Akt signaling, significantly blocked the antiproliferative effects of CAPE. In summary, our results suggest that CAPE administration may be useful as an adjuvant therapy for prostate and potentially other types of cancers that are driven by the p70S6K and Akt signaling networks.""","""['Chih-Pin Chuu', 'Hui-Ping Lin', 'Mark F Ciaccio', 'John M Kokontis', 'Ronald J Hause Jr', 'Richard A Hiipakka', 'Shutsung Liao', 'Richard Baker Jones']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Cancer Prev Res (Phila)""","""['CAPE suppresses migration and invasion of prostate cancer cells via activation of non-canonical Wnt signaling.', 'Caffeic acid phenethyl ester induced cell cycle arrest and growth inhibition in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells via regulation of Skp2, p53, p21Cip1 and p27Kip1.', 'Caffeic acid phenethyl ester suppresses EGFR/FAK/Akt signaling, migration, and tumor growth of prostate cancer cells.', 'The anticancer mechanism of caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE): review of melanomas, lung and prostate cancers.', 'Caffeic Acid phenethyl ester is a potential therapeutic agent for oral cancer.', 'Propolis: A Detailed Insight of Its Anticancer Molecular Mechanisms.', 'The Role of ERα and ERβ in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer and Current Therapeutic Approaches.', 'Molecular and Cellular Mechanisms of Propolis and Its Polyphenolic Compounds against Cancer.', 'Aspalathus linearis suppresses cell survival and proliferation of enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer cells via inhibition of c-Myc and stability of androgen receptor.', 'Caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) confers wild type p53 function in p53Y220C mutant: bioinformatics and experimental evidence.']"""

Most of these tools were designed for use with Western populations and have not been validated across different ethnic groups. Therefore, we evaluated the predictive value of the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) and the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) risk calculators in a Chinese cohort. Clinicopathological information was obtained from 495 Chinese men who had undergone extended prostate biopsies between January 2009 and March 2011. The estimated probabilities of prostate cancer and high-grade disease (Gleason >6) were calculated using the PCPT and ERSPC risk calculators. Overall measures, discrimination, calibration and clinical usefulness were assessed for the model evaluation. Of these patients, 28.7% were diagnosed with prostate cancer and 19.4% had high-grade disease. Compared to the PCPT model and the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) threshold of 4 ng ml(-1), the ERSPC risk calculator exhibited better discriminative ability for predicting positive biopsies and high-grade disease (the area under the curve was 0.831 and 0.852, respectively, P<0.01 for both). Decision curve analysis also suggested the favourable clinical utility of the ERSPC calculator in the validation dataset. Both prediction models demonstrated miscalibration: the risk of prostate cancer and high-grade disease was overestimated by approximately 20% for a wide range of predicted probabilities. In conclusion, the ERSPC risk calculator outperformed both the PCPT model and the PSA threshold of 4 ng ml(-1) in predicting prostate cancer and high-grade disease in Chinese patients.

Despite intensive studies on steroid function at the genomic level, their nongenomic actions remain an enigma. In this study, we investigated the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in androgen-stimulated prostate cancer (PCa) cell proliferation. In androgen-treated PCa cells, increased cell growth and ROS production correlated with elevated p66Shc protein, an authentic oxidase. This growth stimulation was blocked by antioxidants. Further, elevated expression of p66Shc protein by cDNA transfection encoding wild-type protein, but not a redox-deficient (W134F) mutant, was associated with increased PCa cell proliferation. Conversely, knockdown of p66Shc expression by shRNA resulted in diminished cell growth. Increased p66Shc expression in PCa cells enhanced their tumorigenicity in xenograft animals. Importantly, p66Shc protein level is higher in clinical prostate adenocarcinomas than in adjacent noncancerous cells. Expression of redox-deficient p66Shc mutant protein abolished androgen-stimulated cell growth. In androgen-treated, H(2)O(2)-treated, and p66Shc cDNA-transfected PCa cells, cellular prostatic acid phosphatase, an authentic tyrosine phosphatase, was inactivated by reversible oxidation; subsequently, ErbB-2 was activated by phosphorylation at tyrosine-1221/1222. These results together support the notion that androgens induce ROS production through the elevation of p66Shc protein, which inactivates tyrosine phosphatase activity for the activation of interacting tyrosine kinase, leading to increased cell proliferation and enhanced tumorigenicity. Our results thus suggest that p66Shc protein functions at the critical junction point between androgens and tyrosine phosphorylation signaling in human PCa cells.""","""['Suresh Veeramani', 'Yu-Wei Chou', 'Frank C Lin', 'Sakthivel Muniyan', 'Fen-Fen Lin', 'Satyendra Kumar', 'Yan Xie', 'Subodh M Lele', 'Yaping Tu', 'Ming-Fong Lin']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Free Radic Biol Med""","""['Mitochondrial redox signaling by p66Shc is involved in regulating androgenic growth stimulation of human prostate cancer cells.', 'The mitochondrial reactive oxygen species regulator p66Shc controls PDGF-induced signaling and migration through protein tyrosine phosphatase oxidation.', 'p66Shc longevity protein regulates the proliferation of human ovarian cancer cells.', 'p66Shc--a longevity redox protein in human prostate cancer progression and metastasis : p66Shc in cancer progression and metastasis.', 'The interplay between p66Shc, reactive oxygen species and cancer cell metabolism.', 'Dynamics of antioxidant heme oxygenase-1 and pro-oxidant p66Shc in promoting advanced prostate cancer progression.', 'Roles of Reactive Oxygen Species in Biological Behaviors of Prostate Cancer.', 'ErbB-2 signaling in advanced prostate cancer progression and potential therapy.', 'p66Shc protein through a redox mechanism enhances the progression of prostate cancer cells towards castration-resistance.', 'p66Shc regulates migration of castration-resistant prostate cancer cells.']"""

Methods:   Screening center coordinators were asked, using a self-administered paper questionnaire, to rate the extent to which specific tracking and tracing methods were used.  Results:   Many methods were used by the screening centers, including telephone calls, mail, and internet searches. The most extensively used methods involved telephoning the participant on his or her home or cell phone, or telephoning a person identified by the participant as someone who would know about the participant's whereabouts. Internet searches were used extensively as well; these included searches on names, reverse-lookup searches (on addresses or telephone numbers) and searches of the Social Security Death Index.

The William Buckland Radiotherapy Center has been performing high-dose-rate brachytherapy with external beam radiation treatment for prostate cancer since 1998 and has an extensive prospective database on all patients treated. The purpose of this analysis was to assess the risk of stricture formation and identify the predictive or causative factors.  Methods and materials:   Three hundred fifty-four patients were treated between 1998 and 2008. Patients received one of three differing dose schedules: 20Gy in four treatments (20Gy/4), 18Gy/3, and 19Gy/2 during three sequential time periods. Nelson-Aalen cumulative hazard modeling was used to estimate risk of events over time. Potential risk factors, including dose, were identified and used in the analysis.  Results:   There were 45 patients who developed at least one stricture, an overall risk of 8.2% at 2 years. The 2-year risk of stricture formation was 3.4%, 2.3%, and 31.6% for 18Gy/3, 20Gy/4, and 19Gy/2, respectively. Most strictures occurred in the bulbomembranous urethra (50%) or external sphincter region (33%). On multivariable analysis, the dose schedule used was the only significant predictor for increased stricture formation.  Conclusions:   In our patients, those who received 19Gy/2 were at a significantly higher risk of stricture formation.

Three tools--Partin tables, the European Society for Urological Oncology (ESUO) criteria, and the Gallina nomogram--have been proposed for the prediction of seminal vesicle invasion (SVI) in patients with clinically localized prostate cancer who are candidates for a radical prostatectomy.  Objectives:   Using different statistical methods, we aimed to determine which of these tools should be used to predict SVI.  Design, settings, and participants:   The independent validation cohort consisted of 2584 patients treated surgically for clinically localized prostate cancer at four North American tertiary care centers between 2002 and 2007.  Interventions:   Robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Primary outcome was the presence of SVI. Traditional (area under the receiver operating characteristic [ROC] curve, calibration plots, the Brier score, sensitivity and specificity, positive and negative predictive value) and novel (decision curve analysis and predictiveness curves) statistical methods quantified the predictive abilities of the three models.  Results and limitations:   Traditional statistical methods (ie, ROC plots and Brier scores) could not clearly determine which one of the three SVI prediction tools should be preferred. For example, ROC plots and Brier scores seemed biased against the binary decision tool (ESUO criteria) and gave discordant results for the continuous predictions of the Partin tables and the Gallina nomogram. The results of the calibration plots were discordant with those of the ROC plots. Conversely, the decision curve indicated that the Partin tables represent the best strategy for stratifying the risk of SVI, resulting in the highest net benefit within the whole range of threshold probabilities.  Conclusions:   When predicting SVI, surgeons should prefer the Partin tables over the ESUO criteria and the Gallina nomogram because this tool provided the highest net benefit. In contrast to traditional statistical methods, decision curve analysis gave an unambiguous result applicable to both continuous and binary models, providing an insight into clinical utility.""","""['Giovanni Lughezzani', 'Kevin C Zorn', 'Lars Budäus', 'Maxine Sun', 'David I Lee', 'Arieh L Shalhav', 'Gregory P Zagaya', 'Sergey A Shikanov', 'Ofer N Gofrit', 'Alan E Thong', 'David M Albala', 'Leon Sun', 'Angel Cronin', 'Andrew J Vickers', 'Pierre I Karakiewicz']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Stages of prediction model comparison.', 'Multi-institutional external validation of seminal vesicle invasion nomograms: head-to-head comparison of Gallina nomogram versus 2007 Partin tables.', 'External Validation of a Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging-based Nomogram for the Prediction of Extracapsular Extension and Seminal Vesicle Invasion in Prostate Cancer Patients Undergoing Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Development and split-sample validation of a nomogram predicting the probability of seminal vesicle invasion at radical prostatectomy.', 'Is it necessary to remove the seminal vesicles completely at radical prostatectomy? decision curve analysis of European Society of Urologic Oncology criteria.', 'Evaluation of markers and risk prediction models: overview of relationships between NRI and decision-analytic measures.', 'Predictive model containing PI-RADS v2 score for postoperative seminal vesicle invasion among prostate cancer patients.', 'External validation of a prediction tool to estimate the risk of human immunodeficiency virus infection amongst men who have sex with men.', 'Prediction of Low Birth Weight Delivery by Maternal Status and Its Validation: Decision Curve Analysis.', 'Development and comparison of a Chinese nomogram adding multi-parametric MRI information for predicting extracapsular extension of prostate cancer.', 'Assessing the Clinical Impact of Risk Prediction Models With Decision Curves: Guidance for Correct Interpretation and Appropriate Use.']"""

Results:   In the healthy subjects, rs16901979 A-allele frequency was highest amongst Chinese (0.32) compared with Malays (0.13; P < 0.0001) or Indians (0.09; P < 0.0001); rs6983267 G-allele was highest in Indians (0.51) compared with Chinese (0.42; P = 0.041) or Malays (0.43; P = 0.077); whereas rs1859962 G-allele frequency was highest amongst Indians (0.56) compared with Chinese (0.40; P = 0.0002) or Malays (0.38; P < 0.0001). Individuals with the rs4430796 TT genotype were at increased CaP risk in the Chinese via a recessive model (odds ratios (OR) = 1.56, 95% CI = 1.04-2.33). Significant associations were observed for rs4430796 TT with Gleason scores of ≥ 7 (OR = 1.76, 95% CI = 1.14-2.73) and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels of ≥ 10 ng/ml at diagnosis (OR = 1.63, 95% CI = 1.01-2.63), as well as for rs6983267 GG with stage 3-4 CaPs (OR = 1.91, 95% CI = 1.01-3.61). A cumulative gene interaction influence on disease risk, which approximately doubled for individuals with at least 2 susceptibility genotypes, was also identified (OR = 2.18, 95% CI = 1.10-4.32).  Conclusions:   This exploratory analysis suggests that the 5 genetic variants previously described may contribute to prostate cancer risk in Singaporean men.""","""['Jason Yongsheng Chan', 'Huihua Li', 'Onkar Singh', 'Anupama Mahajan', 'Saminathan Ramasamy', 'Koilan Subramaniyan', 'Ravindran Kanesvaran', 'Hong Gee Sim', 'Tsung Wen Chong', 'Yik-Ying Teo', 'Sin Eng Chia', 'Min-Han Tan', 'Balram Chowbay']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['A replication study examining three common single-nucleotide polymorphisms and the risk of prostate cancer in a Japanese population.', 'Association between single nucleotide polymorphisms on chromosome 17q and the risk of prostate cancer in a Chinese population.', 'Association between two unlinked loci at 8q24 and prostate cancer risk among European Americans.', 'Racial disparities in the association between diabetes mellitus-associated polymorphic locus rs4430796 of the HNF1β gene and prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', '8q24 rs4242382 polymorphism is a risk factor for prostate cancer among multi-ethnic populations: evidence from clinical detection in China and a meta-analysis.', 'Association of 17q24 rs1859962 gene polymorphism with prostate cancer risk: A systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'The incidence, mortality, and risk factors of prostate cancer in Asian men.', 'Cumulative evidence for relationships between multiple variants of HNF1B and the risk of prostate and endometrial cancers.', 'Association between 8q24 Gene Polymorphisms and the Risk of Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'Association between 8q24 rs6983267 polymorphism and cancer susceptibility: a meta-analysis involving 170,737 subjects.']"""

Cholinesterase is well known as having non-cholinergic functions such as cellular proliferation and differentiation, suggesting a possible influence of cholinesterase in tumorogenesis. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the whole blood acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and plasma butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) activities and some biochemical parameters in PCa patients. This study was performed in 66 PCa patients and 40 control subjects. AChE and BChE activities were determined in PCa patients and the influence of the Gleason score; bone metastasis and treatment in the enzyme activities were also verified. Furthermore, we also analyzed possible biochemical alterations in these patients. AChE and BChE activities decreased in PCa patients in relation to the control group and various biochemical changes were observed in these patients. Moreover, Gleason score, metastasis and treatment influenced cholinesterase activities and biochemical determinations. Our results suggest that cholinesterases activities and biochemical parameters are altered in PCa. These facts support the idea that the drop in the cholinesterase activity and the consequent increased amount of acetylcholine could lead to a cholinergic overstimulation and increase the cell proliferation in PCa.""","""['Vanessa Battisti', 'Margarete D Bagatini', 'Liési D K Maders', 'Juarez Chiesa', 'Karen F Santos', 'Jamile F Gonçalves', 'Fátima H Abdalla', 'Iara E Battisti', 'Maria R C Schetinger', 'Vera M Morsch']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Biomed Pharmacother""","""['Oxidative stress and antioxidant status in prostate cancer patients: relation to Gleason score, treatment and bone metastasis.', 'Ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase (E-NPP) and adenosine deaminase (ADA) activities in prostate cancer patients: influence of Gleason score, treatment and bone metastasis.', 'Analysis of cholinesterases in human prostate and sperm: implications in cancer and fertility.', 'Acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase as possible markers of low-grade systemic inflammation.', 'Status of cholinesterase activities in blood in neuropsychiatric disorders.', 'Clinical value of cholinesterase in patients treated with radical nephroureterectomy for upper urinary tract carcinoma.', 'An Investigation of the Prognostic Role of Genes Related to Lipid Metabolism in Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma.', 'Identification and validation of a lipid metabolism gene signature for predicting biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy.', 'Cholinesterase is Associated With Prognosis and Response to Chemotherapy in Advanced Gastric Cancer.', 'Biphasic Alteration of Butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) During Prostate Cancer Development.']"""

The relative advantages and disadvantages of each approach have been the subject of extensive debate, and some contend that the intraoperative approach is vital to the delivery of optimal therapy. The purpose of this study was to determine whether high-quality permanent prostate implants can be achieved consistently using a preoperative planning approach that allows for, but does not necessitate, intraoperative optimization. To achieve this purpose, we reviewed the records of 100 men with intermediate-risk prostate cancer who had been prospectively treated with brachytherapy monotherapy between 2006 and 2009 at our institution. All patients were treated with iodine-125 stranded seeds; the planned target dose was 145 Gy. Only 8 patients required adjustments to the plan on the basis of intraoperative findings. Consistency and quality were assessed by calculating the correlation coefficient between the planned and implanted amounts of radioactivity and by examining the mean values of the dosimetric parameters obtained on preoperative and 30 days postoperative treatment planning. The amount of radioactivity implanted was essentially identical to that planned (mean planned radioactivity, 41.27 U vs. mean delivered radioactivity, 41.36 U; R(2) = 0.99). The mean planned and day 30 prostate V100 values were 99.9% and 98.6%, respectively. The mean planned and day 30 prostate D90 values were 186.3 and 185.1 Gy, respectively. Consistent, high-quality prostate brachytherapy treatment plans can be achieved using a preoperative planning approach, mostly without the need for intraoperative optimization. Good quality assurance measures during simulation, treatment planning, implantation, and postimplant evaluation are paramount for achieving a high level of quality and consistency.""","""['Rajat J Kudchadker', 'Thomas J Pugh', 'David A Swanson', 'Teresa L Bruno', 'Yasemin Bolukbasi', 'Steven J Frank']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Med Dosim""","""['Prostate seed implantation using 3D-computer assisted intraoperative planning vs. a standard look-up nomogram: Improved target conformality with reduction in urethral and rectal wall dose.', 'Real-time intraoperative evaluation of implant quality and dose correction during prostate brachytherapy consistently improves target coverage using a novel image fusion and optimization program.', 'Sensitivity of clinically relevant dosimetric parameters to contouring uncertainty in postimplant dosimetry of low-dose-rate prostate permanent seed brachytherapy.', 'Which patients benefit from post-implant CT dosimetry after real-time intraoperative planning for low dose rate prostate brachytherapy?

First, experiments on a tissue mimic phantom to determine the optimal acoustic power and exposure durations with a 10% duty cycle and a 1 Hz pulse rate were performed. The temperature variation was monitored using real-time MR thermometry. Second, tumor-bearing animals were treated with pFUS. There were three groups (n = 8/group): group 1 received pFUS + Dox (10 mg/kg i.v. injection immediately after pFUS exposure), group 2 received Dox only (10 mg/kg i.v. injection), and group 3 was a control. Animals were euthanized 2 h after the pFUS treatment. The Dox concentration in the treated tumors was measured by quantifying fluorescent tracers using a fluorometer. Third, the histological changes of tumors with and without pFUS treatments were evaluated. Finally, experiments were performed to study the spatial drug distribution in tumors after the pFUS treatment, in which two animals received pFUS + Dox, two animals received Dox only, and one animal was used as control. Two hours following the treatment, animals were euthanized and processed. The Dox distribution was determined using a fluorescence microscope.  Results:   Parametric measurements using a tissue phantom showed that the temperature increased with an increasing acoustic power (from 10 to 50 W) or sonication duration (from 10 to 60 s) with a given acoustic frequency of 1 MHz, duty cycle 10%, and pulse rate 1 Hz. A set of ultrasound parameters was identified with which the temperature elevation was less than 5 °C, which was used for nonthermal pFUS sonication. Increased Dox concentration (14.9 ± 2.5 μg/g) was measured in the pFUS-treated group compared to the Dox-only group (9.5 ± 1.6 μg/g), indicating an approximate 60% increase with p = 0.05. The results were consistent with the increased spatial drug distributions by fluorescence imaging. Histological analysis showed increased extravasation in pFUS-treated prostate tumors suggesting increased drug delivery with pFUS.  Conclusions:   The results showed that pFUS-enhanced drug uptake in prostate tumors was significant. This increased uptake may be due to increased extravasation by pFUS. Optimal pFUS parameters may exist to maximize the drug uptake, and this study using Dox demonstrated a quantitative method for such systematic parametric studies.

Methods:   A daily nonzero action level setup correction strategy using CUSUM chart was proposed and tested retrospectively on 34 nonrandomized patients with prostate-implanted fiducial markers in situ plus daily localization via stereoscopic electronic portal imaging. A cumulative error index, which monitors a cumulative process index over time, was implemented in parallel with the localization offsets of the prostate. A value of this index exceeding a decision interval H indicated that a systematic change in the mean value of localization had occurred. When a value of the index exceeding H was recorded, the magnitude of the systematic shift was estimated and the subsequent prescribed offsets were corrected to account for the new setup positions. With the new protocol, the authors produced simulated treatment histories in which the detection of systematic shifts and the frequency of localization offset exceeding action level were evaluated. The protocol was examined against three levels of mean systematic shifts of localization for detection (μ(1)) of 3, 5, and 7 mm.  Results:   The overall rates of detection of systematic shifts using this algorithm were relatively high. The level μ(1) = 3 mm resulted in the highest rate of detection of systematic offset change, in 42% of the charts. For larger values of μ(1), the overall detection numbers fell to 18% and 12% of the charts for μ(1) = 5 and 7 mm, respectively. The mean magnitude of change in systematic offset at time of detection was 3.1, 4.4, and 5.2 mm for μ(1) = 3, 5, and 7 mm, respectively. By adapting the setup position for any change in systematic localization offset over a course of treatment using the new protocol, it has been shown that the frequency of localization offsets exceeding action levels was reduced. For the optimal choice of intervention levels for correction and μ(1), the number of localization offsets exceeding action levels has been reduced by approximately half.  Conclusions:   The nonzero fixed action level setup correction strategy incorporating CUSUM charts has been shown to provide an objective method for (i) detecting a systematic shift of a patient localization offset, (ii) quantifying the magnitude of a systematic change based on previous observations, and (iii) correcting the prescribed offset by accounting for the systematic shift(s) in patient setup position.""","""['N M Ung', 'L Wee']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Retrospective analysis of prostate cancer patients with implanted gold markers using off-line and adaptive therapy protocols.', 'Evaluation of multiple image-based modalities for image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT) of prostate carcinoma: a prospective study.', 'Daily ultrasound-based image-guided targeting for radiotherapy of upper abdominal malignancies.', 'Correction of systematic setup errors in prostate radiation therapy: how many images to perform?', 'Application of the No Action Level (NAL) protocol to correct for prostate motion based on electronic portal imaging of implanted markers.', 'Calibrated breast density methods for full field digital mammography: a system for serial quality control and inter-system generalization.']"""

The innovation of this program is that the number of 2D contours can be very much smaller than the number of transverse sections, even for anatomy structures spanning many sections. This program can edit 3D structures from prior segmentations, including those from autosegmentation programs. The reconstruction and surface editing works with any image modality.  Methods:   Structures are represented by variational implicit surfaces defined by weighted sums of radial basis functions (RBFs). Such surfaces are smooth, continuous, and closed and can be reconstructed with RBFs optimally located to efficiently capture shape in any combination of transverse (T), sagittal (S), and coronal (C) views. The accuracy of implicit surface reconstructions was measured by comparisons with the corresponding expert-contoured surfaces in 103 prostate cancer radiotherapy plans. Editing a pre-existing surface is done by overdrawing its profiles in image views spanning the affected part of the structure, deleting an appropriate set of prior RBFs, and merging the remainder with the new edit contour RBFs. Two methods were devised to identify RBFs to be deleted based only on the geometry of the initial surface and the locations of the new RBFs.  Results:   Expert-contoured surfaces were compared with implicit surfaces reconstructed from them over varying numbers and combinations of T/S/C planes. Studies revealed that surface-surface agreement increases monotonically with increasing RBF-sample density, and that the rate of increase declines over the same range. These trends were observed for all surface agreement metrics and for all the organs studied-prostate, bladder, and rectum. In addition, S and C contours may convey more shape information than T views for CT studies in which the axial slice thickness is greater than the pixel size. Surface editing accuracy likewise improves with larger sampling densities, and the rate of improvement similarly declines over the same conditions.  Conclusions:   Implicit surfaces based on RBFs are accurate representations of anatomic structures and can be interactively generated or modified to correct segmentation errors. The number of input contours is typically smaller than the number of T contours spanned by the structure.""","""['Lyndon S Hibbard']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Contour interpolated radial basis functions with spline boundary correction for fast 3D reconstruction of the human articular cartilage from MR images.', 'Adaptive reconstruction of pipe-shaped human organs from 3D ultrasonic volume.', 'Statistical shape model-based reconstruction of a scaled, patient-specific surface model of the pelvis from a single standard AP x-ray radiograph.', 'A continuous surface reconstruction method on point cloud captured from a 3D surface photogrammetry system.', '3D ultrasonography for examination of the musculoskeletal system.', 'Accurate validation of ultrasound imaging of prostate cancer: a review of challenges in registration of imaging and histopathology.', 'Making the right software choice for clinically used equipment in radiation oncology.']"""

A hallmark of osteoblast differentiation is the formation of matrix whose predominant protein is type 1 collagen. We investigated the formation of a collagen matrix by osteoblasts cultured with prostate cancer cells, and its effects on interactions between prostate cancer cells and osteoblasts.  Results:   In the presence of exogenous ascorbic acid (AA), a co-factor in collagen synthesis, mouse MC3T3 pre-osteoblasts in mixed cultures with human LNCaP prostate cancer cells or LNCaP cells modified to overexpress Shh (LNShh cells) formed collagen matrix with distinct fibril ultrastructural characteristics. AA increased the activity of alkaline phosphatase and the expression of the alkaline phosphatase gene Akp2, markers of osteoblast differentiation, in MC3T3 pre-osteoblasts cultured with LNCaP or LNShh cells. However, the AA-stimulated increase in Akp2 expression in MC3T3 pre-osteoblasts cultured with LNShh cells far exceeded the levels observed in MC3T3 cells cultured with either LNCaP cells with AA or LNShh cells without AA. Therefore, AA and Shh exert a synergistic effect on osteoblast differentiation. We determined whether the effect of AA on LNShh cell-induced osteoblast differentiation was mediated by Shh signaling. AA increased the expression of Gli1 and Ptc1, target genes of the Shh pathway, in MC3T3 pre-osteoblasts cultured with LNShh cells to at least twice their levels without AA. The ability of AA to upregulate Shh signaling and enhance alkaline phosphatase activity was blocked in MC3T3 cells that expressed a dominant negative form of the transcription factor GLI1. The AA-stimulated increase in Shh signaling and Shh-induced osteoblast differentiation was also inhibited by the specific collagen synthesis inhibitor 3,4-dehydro-L-proline.  Conclusions:   Matrix collagen, formed by osteoblasts in the presence of AA, potentiates Shh signaling between Shh-expressing prostate cancer cells and osteoblasts. Collagen and Shh signaling exert a synergistic effect on osteoblast differentiation, a defining event in prostate carcinoma bone metastasis. Investigations into paracrine interactions among prostate cancer cells, osteoblasts, and osteoblast-synthesized matrix proteins advance our understanding of mechanisms contributing to prostate cancer bone metastasis.""","""['Samantha M Zunich', 'Maria Valdovinos', 'Taneka Douglas', 'David Walterhouse', 'Philip Iannaccone', 'Marilyn L G Lamm']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Mol Cancer""","""['Paracrine sonic hedgehog signalling by prostate cancer cells induces osteoblast differentiation.', 'Distinct proliferative and differentiated stages of murine MC3T3-E1 cells in culture: an in vitro model of osteoblast development.', 'Prostate cancer cells and bone stromal cells mutually interact with each other through bone morphogenetic protein-mediated signals.', 'Actions of hedgehog proteins on skeletal cells.', 'Sonic Hedgehog Signaling Pathway: A\xa0Role in\xa0Pain Processing.', 'Cancer Stem Cells and Prostate Cancer: A Narrative Review.', 'Procoxacin bidirectionally inhibits osteoblastic and osteoclastic activity in bone and suppresses bone metastasis of prostate cancer.', 'Repurposing Vitamin C for Cancer Treatment: Focus on Targeting the Tumor Microenvironment.', 'Ras and Wnt Interaction Contribute in Prostate Cancer Bone Metastasis.', 'The regulatory pathways leading to stem-like cells underlie prostate cancer progression.']"""

Current diagnosis methods lack specificity and sensitivity, leading to overdiagnosis and overtreatment of patients with low-risk organ-confined localized disease. Therefore, new non-invasive molecular tools are needed to discriminate between localized and locally advanced disease.  Methods:   Plasma telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) mRNA levels were determined by qRT-PCR in 49 patients with localized and locally advanced PCa. Diagnostic accuracy and efficacy as a prognostic factor of biochemical recurrence of plasma hTERT mRNA were determined using univariate and multivariate analyses and compared with conventional tumor markers.  Results:   Patients with locally advanced disease had significantly (p < 0.05) higher plasma hTERT mRNA and serum PSA levels than those with localized disease. Plasma hTERT mRNA test showed lower sensitivity (83% vs. 100%), higher specificity (73% vs. 43%), AUC ROC curve (0.911 vs. 0.757), and positive likelihood ratios (6.17 vs. 1.76) than the PSA assay in discriminating between localized and locally advanced disease. At multivariate analysis, plasma hTERT mRNA levels and age but not PSA showed a positive trend (p = 0.05) in the risk of locally advanced PCa. On univariate analysis, plasma hTERT mRNA and serum PSA were identified as significant prognostic factors of biochemical recurrence. Using ROC curves and the appropriate cutoff, both tests showed high sensitivity (85%) and specificity (72%). Kaplan-Meier curves confirmed the significant differences between the groups and patients with higher levels than the cutoff value showed diminished recurrence-free survival (p < 0.05). At multivariate analysis, Gleason score and PSA were the strongest factors associated with biochemical recurrence (p < 0.05), whereas hTERT mRNA did not reach statistical significance, although a positive trend was observed (p = 0.09).  Conclusion:   Plasma hTERT mRNA quantification can be both a useful non-invasive tumor marker for discriminating between localized and locally advanced PCa, as well as a prognostic factor of recurrence at the molecular level.""","""['José A March-Villalba', 'José M Martínez-Jabaloyas', 'María J Herrero', 'José Santamaría', 'Salvador F Aliño', 'Francisco Dasí']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Expert Opin Biol Ther""","""['Cell-free circulating plasma hTERT mRNA is a useful marker for prostate cancer diagnosis and is associated with poor prognosis tumor characteristics.', 'Real-time quantification of human telomerase reverse transcriptase mRNA in the plasma of patients with prostate cancer.', 'Multigene methylation analysis for detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Prostate biopsy: who, how and when.

Until the 1990s, Western European countries showed a low frequency of TB infection, but the rise of immigration has led to a rapid increase in its occurrence. In the elderly, TB is emerging as a significant health problem (age-related decline of the cell-mediated immunity, associated illnesses, use of immunosuppressive drugs, malnutrition, poor life conditions), although its detection and diagnosis is not easy also considering its subclinical presentation. Almost 70% of all TB infections in Italy are found in the lungs; 50% of the extrapulmonary infections affect lymph nodes. Due to the low incidence of superficial tuberculous lymphadenitis without pulmonary manifestations, the possibility of a TB aetiology is often not taken into consideration in the differential diagnosis of lymphadenopathy, resulting in significant delay of appropriate treatment. Herein, we describe the case of a 78-year-old male with nocturnal fever, weakness, night sweats, loss of weight and decay in general condition. The patient had a past medical history of prostate adenocarcinoma treated with hormone therapy. The past medical history in association with clinical findings and laboratory data (anaemia, high titers of fibrinogen and reactive C-protein) led to the suspect of metastatic adenocarcinoma.

Results:   Eighteen of 576 identified patients (3.1%) developed BRONJ including 8 of 190 patients (4.2%) with breast cancer, 6 of 83 patients (7.2%) with multiple myeloma, 2 of 84 patients (2.4%) with prostate cancer, 1 of 76 patients (1.3%) with lung cancer, 1 of 52 patients (1.9%) with renal cell carcinoma, and in none of the 73 patients with other malignancies. Ten patients (59%) developed BRONJ after tooth extraction, whereas 7 (41%) developed it spontaneously (missing data for 1 patient). The mean number of BP infusions (38.1 ± 19.06 infusions vs. 10.5 ± 12.81 infusions; P<0.001) and duration of BP treatment (44.3 ± 24.34 mo vs. 14.6 ± 18.09 mo; P<0.001) were significantly higher in patients with BRONJ compared with patients without BRONJ.

We determined whether recombinant human apolipoprotein(a) kringle V, rhLK8, produces therapeutic efficacy in an orthotopic human prostate cancer animal model. Fifty thousand androgen-independent human prostate cancer cells (PC-3MM2) were injected into the prostate of nude mice. After 3 days, these mice were randomized to receive the vehicle solution (intraperitoneally [i.p.], daily), paclitaxel (8 mg/kg i.p., weekly), rhLK8 (50 mg/kg i.p., daily), or a combination of paclitaxel and rhLK8 for 4 weeks. Treatment with paclitaxel or rhLK8 alone did not show significant therapeutic effects on tumor incidence or on tumor size compared with the control group. The combination of rhLK8 and paclitaxel significantly reduced tumor size and incidence of lymph node metastasis. Significant reduction in microvessel density and cellular proliferation and induction of apoptosis of tumor cells, and tumor-associated endothelial cells, were also achieved. Similarly, PC-3MM2 tumors growing in the tibia showed significant suppression of tumor growth and lymph node metastasis by the combination treatment with rhLK8 and paclitaxel. The integrity of the bone was significantly preserved, and apoptosis of tumor cells and tumor-associated endothelial cells was increased.

Here, we determined the uptake of iodide (I(-) ) and iodine (I(2) ), as well as the antiproliferative and apoptotic effects of 6-iodolactone (6-IL) and both forms of iodine in human prostate cells lines.  Methods:   Non-cancerous (RWPE-1) and cancerous (LNCaP, DU-145) cells, as well as nude mice xenotransplanted with DU-145 cells were used as cancer models. Iodine uptake was analyzed with radioactive tracers, transporter expression by qRT-PCR, cell proliferation by blue trypan, apoptosis by enzyme immunoassay or fluorescence, BAX and BCL-2 by western-blot, and caspsase 3 by enzymatic assay.  Results:   All three cell lines take up both forms of iodine. In RWPE-1 cells, I(-) uptake depends on the Na(+) /I(-) symporter (NIS), whereas it was independent of NIS in LNCaP and DU-145 cells. Antiproliferative effects of iodine and 6-IL were dose and time dependent; RWPE-1 was most sensitive to I(-) and 6-IL, whereas LNCaP was more sensitive to I(2) . In the three cell lines both forms of iodine activated the intrinsic apoptotic pathway (increasing the BAX/BCL-2 index and caspases).

Methods:   From 2009 onwards, a consecutive series of patients with PCa were enrolled. All patients were staged to evaluate the presence of bone metastasis (BM) with a conventional total-body Tc 99 m MDP scintigraphy performed regardless of baseline PCa characteristics. The area under the curve (AUC) estimates were used to test the accuracy of the Briganti's risk stratification tool that recommended staging baseline bone scan for patients with a biopsy Gleason score >7 or with a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) >10 ng/ml and palpable disease (cT2/T3). The new tool was compared to the European Association of Urology (EAU) guideline.  Results:   A total of 313 patients were consecutively enrolled. Median age was 68 (range 49-95 years), and median PSA was 7 ng/ml (range 0.81-2,670). Twenty (6.4 %) patients presented BMs. Patients with BMs were significantly older, with higher PSA and a higher Gleason score (p = 0.001).

We previously reported that advanced prostate cancer (PCa) patients with multiple distant bone metastases had markedly decreased serum α2M levels (<20 mg/dl) and no detection of α2M by immunoelectrophoresis (defined as α2M deficiency). We also showed a relationship between serum α2M levels and acute inflammatory biomarkers in PCa patients with or without α2M deficiency. In this study, we analyzed in detail the clinicopathological characteristics and pathogenesis of α2M deficiency in androgen-dependent advanced PCa patients. In this study, 15 PCa patients were diagnosed at the Kitasato University Hospital. α2M levels were determined by laser-nephelometry and immunoelectrophoresis, and PSA levels were determined by enzyme immunoassay. IL-6 levels were measured by a specific luminescence sandwich-type enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and CRP levels were determined by latex nephelometry.

The binding assay for purified α2M and PSA was analyzed by western blotting. α2M deficiency was specific for advanced PCa patients with multiple distant bone metastases. PSA was markedly detected in sera and prostate specimens of advanced PCa patients with α2M deficiency, and there was a negative correlation between serum α2M and PSA levels during the course of clinical treatment. Acute inflammatory biomarkers such as IL-6 and CRP were within reference range in α2M-deficient patients. The binding assay showed that PSA easily bound to α2M, which was detected as an approximately 800-kDa complex by western blotting. Further, genetic analysis of a α2M-deficient patient showed no mutations in the α2M gene. These results suggested that α2M deficiency develops from catabolism of α2M in androgen-dependent advanced PCa patients, and serum α2M level may be an indicator of PCa disease progression in addition to PSA level.""","""['Yuhsaku Kanoh', 'Hideki Ohtani', 'Shin Egawa', 'Shiro Baba', 'Tohru Akahoshi']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Int J Oncol""","""['Changes of proteases and proteinase inhibitors in androgen-dependent advanced prostate cancer patients with alpha2-macroglobulin deficiency.', 'Levels of acute inflammatory biomarkers in advanced prostate cancer patients with α2-macroglobulin deficiency.', 'Prognostic potential of a PSA complex in sera of prostate cancer patients with alpha2-macroglobulin deficiency.', 'Immunological background of plasma protein abnormalities--the relation between inflammation and malignant neoplasm.', 'Alpha-2-macroglobulin as a radioprotective agent: a review.', 'Altered CSF Proteomic Profiling of Paediatric Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Patients with CNS Infiltration.', 'PSA-alpha-2-macroglobulin complex is enzymatically active in the serum of patients with advanced prostate cancer and can degrade circulating peptide hormones.']"""

Certain unique features of CMV, including its capacity to actively replicate in the presence of strong host CMV-specific immunity, may give CMV an advantage compared with other virus-based vaccine delivery platforms. In the present study, we tested the utility of mouse CMV (mCMV)-based vaccines expressing human prostate-specific antigen (PSA) for prostate cancer immunotherapy in double-transgenic mice expressing PSA and HLA-DRB1*1501 (DR2bxPSA F1 mice). We assessed the capacity of 2 mCMV-based vectors to induce PSA-specific CD8 T-cell responses and affect the growth of PSA-expressing Transgenic Adenocarcinoma of the Mouse Prostate tumors (TRAMP-PSA). In the absence of tumor challenge, immunization with mCMV vectors expressing either a H2-D(b)-restricted epitope PSA(65-73) (mCMV/PSA(65-73)) or the full-length gene for PSA (mCMV/PSA(FL)) induced comparable levels of CD8 T-cell responses that increased (inflated) with time. Upon challenge with TRAMP-PSA tumor cells, animals immunized with mCMV/PSA(65-73) had delay of tumor growth and increased PSA-specific CD8 T-cell responses, whereas animals immunized with mCMV/PSA(FL) showed progressive tumor growth and no increase in number of splenic PSA(65-73)-specific T cells. The data show that a prototype CMV-based prostate cancer vaccine can induce an effective antitumor immune response in a ""humanized"" double-transgenic mouse model.

We investigated the effect of siRNA-mediated gene silencing of 222 metabolic enzymes, transporters, and regulators on the survival of 3 metastatic prostate cancer cell lines and a nonmalignant prostate epithelial cell line. This approach revealed significant complexity in the metabolic requirements of prostate cancer cells and identified several genes selectively required for their survival. Among these genes was 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-biphosphatase 4 (PFKFB4), an isoform of phosphofructokinase 2 (PFK2). We show that PFKFB4 is required to balance glycolytic activity and antioxidant production to maintain cellular redox balance in prostate cancer cells. Depletion of PFKFB4 inhibited tumor growth in a xenograft model, indicating that it is required under physiologic nutrient levels. PFKFB4 mRNA expression was also found to be greater in metastatic prostate cancer compared with primary tumors. Taken together, these results indicate that PFKFB4 is a potential target for the development of antineoplastic agents.  Significance:   Cancer cells undergo several changes in their metabolism that promote growth and survival. Using an unbiased functional screen, we found that the glycolytic enzyme PFKFB4 is essential for prostate cancer cell survival by maintaining the balance between the use of glucose for energy generation and the synthesis of antioxidants.

Objective:   To delineate the risk factors associated with post-PNB bacteremia and/or urinary tract infection (UTI) and determine why this risk has risen over time.  Design, setting, and participants:   A case-control study in a Canadian tertiary-care center. Cases were all patients who developed bacteremia and/or UTIs after PNB between 2002 and 2011; controls were randomly selected among patients who underwent a PNB without such complications.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Crude and adjusted odds ratios and their 95% confidence intervals were calculated using logistic regression.  Results and limitations:   A total of 5798 PNBs were performed during the study period, following which there were 48 cases of urinary sepsis (42% with bacteremia). The incidence increased from 0.52 infections per 100 biopsies in 2002-2009 to 2.15 infections per 100 biopsies in 2010-2011 (p<0.001). Escherichia coli was the predominant pathogen (75% of cases). Among 42 patients whose post-PNB infection was caused by aerobic or facultative Gram-negative rods, 22 patients (52%) were infected by pathogens resistant to ciprofloxacin. Independent risk factors for post-PNB infection were diabetes, hospitalization during the preceding month, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and performance of the biopsy in 2010-2011. In 2010-2011, the minimal inhibitory concentrations for ciprofloxacin increased compared with 2002-2009 (p<0.03). The major limitation of the study was its retrospective hospital-based nature, which hampered data collection on outpatient antibiotic prescriptions.

While single-center salvage RP outcomes appear promising, little is known about outcomes in the community setting in elderly men. We sought to evaluate utilization, outcomes, and costs of salvage RP vs. primary RP in older men.  Materials and methods:   Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results-Medicare linked data from 1992 to 2007 was used to identify 18,317 men aged 65 years or older who underwent RP from 2002 to 2007. Propensity score analyses were used to compare outcomes and costs for primary vs. salvage RP.  Results:   Salvage RP was rare, accounting for 0.5% of RP. Men undergoing salvage vs. primary RP were older, white, and less likely to undergo CT, bone scan and prostate biopsy preoperatively (P < 0.05 for all). In adjusted analyses, salvage vs. primary RP was associated with increased 30-day complications (60.1% vs. 22.7%, P < 0.01), lengths of stay (mean 7 vs. 3 days, P < 0.01), and hospital readmissions within 30 days (30.4% vs. 5.7%, P < 0.01). The odds of death within 90 days were higher for salvage vs. primary RP (OR 26.7, 95% CI 12.9-55.1, P < 0.01). The median expenditure for salvage RP within 6 months postoperatively was almost twice that for primary RP (US$30,881 vs. US$12,431, P < 0.01).

Electron transport measurements indicate that functionalized NT-FET may be used to detect the binding of OPN to the complementary scFv protein. A concentration-dependent increase in the source-drain current is observed in the regime of clinical significance, with a detection limit of approximately 30 fM. The scFv-NT hybrid devices exhibit selectivity for OPN over other control proteins. These devices respond to the presence of OPN in a background of concentrated bovine serum albumin, without loss of signal. On the basis of these observations, the detection mechanism is attributed to changes in scattering at scFv protein-occupied defect sites on the carbon nanotube sidewall.

Methods:   We conducted a cohort study of men in the UK based General Practice Research Database who were users of the oral undecanoate and injectable forms of testosterone and calculated rates and relative risks of hypertension, polycythemia and prostate conditions (cancer, BPH and prostatism).  Results:   We identified 5841 men who received at least one study testosterone preparation. There were 202 cases of hypertension (crude incidence rates (IRs) for oral and injectable testosterone respectively 12.3/1000 person-years (PY) and 14.4/1000 PY). There were 146 cases of polycythemia (IRs 1.2/1000 PY and 10.1/1000 PY), 46 cases of prostate cancer (IRs 2.5/1000 PY and 1.8/1000 PY), 106 cases of BPH (IRs 4.1 /1000 PY and 2.1/1000 PY), and 251 cases of prostatism (IRs 8.4/1000 PY and 6.1/1000 PY respectively). Adjusted relative risks for oral compared with injectable testosterone were 0.8 (95% CI 0.6, 1.2) for hypertension, 0.13 (0.05, 0.35) for polycythemia, 1.1 (0.7, 1.7) for prostate cancer, 1.5 (1.1, 2.2) for BPH and 1.1 (0.8, 1.4) for prostatism.  Conclusions:   Risks of prostate cancer and prostatism were similar in users of the two preparations, but risks were higher for hypertension and polycythemia in the injectable compared with the oral testosterone users.

Methods:   Our cohort consisted of 68 665 patients with localized prostate cancer, treated with radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy, between 1992 and 2005. Propensity-score matching was used to minimize potential bias related to treatment assignment. Competing-risks analyses tested the effect of treatment type on cancer-specific mortality, after accounting for other-cause mortality. All analyses were stratified according to prostate cancer risk groups, baseline Charlson Comorbidity Index and age.  Results:   For patients treated with radical prostatectomy versus radiotherapy, the 10-year cancer-specific mortality rates were 1.4 versus 3.9% in low-intermediate risk prostate cancer and 6.8 versus 11.5% in high-risk prostate cancer, respectively.

Methods:   A total of 505 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy between 1993 and 2009 were included in this analysis. Cancer location, resection margins and pathological factors were assessed based on the 2010 General Rules for Clinical and Pathological Studies on Prostate Cancer. Biochemical recurrence was defined as prostate-specific antigen >0.2 ng/mL.  Results:   Positive resection margins were found in 38.4% of all cases, in 30.3% of pT2 cases and in 57.7% of pT3 cases. The cancer was distributed evenly among the apex-anterior, apex-posterior and middle lesions, which each accounted for approximately 30% of the whole lesion in the main tumor. A higher rate of positive resection margins (47.6%) was found in the apex-anterior lesions. In minor tumors, most cancer was located in the middle lesion and accounted for approximately 60% of the lesion. However, positive resection margins were detected significantly more frequently in the apex-anterior lesion of minor tumors. The 5-year and 10-year biochemical recurrence-free survival rates were 36.2% and 32.0%, respectively, in patients with a positive resection margin, and 82.7% and 77.4%, respectively, in those with a negative resection margin. Cancer location was an independent risk factor for biochemical recurrence and a positive resection margin. Recurrence-free survival was lower in pT2 cases with a positive resection margin compared with pT3 cases with a negative resection margin.

We surveyed 690 male and female cancer patients and non-patients through an online questionnaire. A large proportion of participants did not understand the terminology used to describe prostate cancer treatments. Most did not know that the terms 'chemical castration', 'hormonal therapy' and 'androgen deprivation' are synonymous. Male respondents stated that they would more readily agree to hormonal therapy than to castration to treat prostate cancer and felt significantly more strongly than women about how androgen deprivation therapy, described in various terms, affected masculinity. Men and women differed substantially in their opinion about the impact of androgen deprivation.

The prosthesis was a hollow silicone elastomer YH-G1 made in China, selected according to the volume of the scrotum and the size of the contralateral testis.  Results:   Thirteen of the patients received testicular prosthesis implantation with orchiectomy, and the other 5 underwent the procedure 6 months later. The operation time of testicular prosthesis implantation was (22.6 +/- 4.6) min, ranging from 15 to 30 minutes. All the patients were discharged after 12 hours of postoperative observation, with a mean hospital stay of (1.3 +/- 0.4) days. A follow-up after 6 months revealed no complications in 17 cases. Rejection occurred in 1 case at 3 months after the implantation, ending in the removal of the prosthesis.

In this retrospective study, we aimed to evaluate our initial experience concerning the bipolar plasma vaporization (BPV) performed in patients with secondary BNS and to assess the efficiency, safety and short-term postoperative results of this approach.  Materials & methods:   Between May 2009 and May 2010, a total of 30 male patients with BNS underwent BPV and were followed for a period of 6 months. BNS was secondary to monopolar transurethral resection of prostate (TURP) in 19 cases, to open surgery for BPH (open prostatectomy) in 8 cases and to radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer in 3 cases. The follow-up protocol included the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), quality of life score (QoL), maximum flow rate (Qmax) and post-voiding residual urinary volume (RV) evaluated at 1, 3 and 6 months after surgery.  Results:   BPV was successfully performed in all cases. All patients were able to void spontaneously and were continent after catheter removal. The mean operating time was 9 minutes, the mean catheterization period was 18 hours and the mean hospital stay was 24 hours.

Depending on the detection method used, neuroendocrine cells are found in 10% to 100% of prostate cancer specimens.  Objective:   A 64-year-old patient was diagnosed in 2006 with adenocarcinoma of the prostate, PSA 4.1 ng/ml, Gleason 6, T3b, positive PSA immunohistochemistry.  Methods and results:   The patient was started on hormone therapy: orchidectomy followed by flutamide 750 mg/day for three years, and underwent radiotherapy 6400 R. The patient was asymptomatic for three years. In 2009, the patient complained of perineal and rectal pain, but the PSA remained normal. In 2010, the patient underwent TUR of the prostate for acute urinary retention. Pathological exam revealed Gleason 8 adenocarcinoma of the prostate (different pathologist suggested Gleason 9) and foci of neuroendocrine cells. Immunohistochemistry detected 15-20% positivity for Cromogranin A and 10% for synaptophysin. The patient developed multiple liver metastases in October 2010 and underwent five cycles of etoposide, carboplatin. The patient died of liver failure in March 2011.  Discussion:   Regarding prevalence, neuroendocrine differentiation is the second phenotype after prostate adenocarcinoma, but still remains undiagnosed. It is resistant to radiation therapy and chemotherapy.

Preliminary studies showed that it not only suppressed tumor growth but also closely related to tumor metastasis, however, its molecular mechanisms is still unclear. There have been reported that protein encoded by LASS2/TMSG-1 could directly interact with the C subunit of Vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase), which suggested that LASS2/TMSG1 might inhibit the invasion and metastasis through regulating the function of V-ATPase. Thus, in this study, we explored the effect of small interference RNA (siRNA) targeting LASS2/TMSG1 on the invasion of human prostate carcinoma cell line PC-3M-2B4 and its molecular mechanisms associated with the V-ATPase. Real-time fluorogentic quantitative PCR (RFQ-PCR) and Western blot revealed dramatic reduction of 84.5% and 60% in the levels of LASS2/TMSG1 mRNA and protein after transfection of siRNA in PC-3M-2B4 cells. The V-ATPase activity and extracellular hydrogen ion concentration were significantly increased in 2B4 cells transfected with the LASS2/TMSG1-siRNA compared with the controls. The activity of secreted MMP-2 was up-regulated in LASS2/TMSG1-siRNA treated cells compared with the controls; and the capacity for migration and invasion in LASS2/TMSG1-siRNA treated cells was significantly higher than the controls. Thus, we concluded that silencing of LASS2/TMSG1 may promote invasion of prostate cancer cell in vitro through increase of V-ATPase activity and extracellular hydrogen ion concentration and in turn the activation of secreted MMP-2.""","""['Xiaoyan Xu', 'Jiangfeng You', 'Fei Pei']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""J Cell Biochem""","""['Clinical and pathological significance of Homo sapiens ceramide synthase 2 (CerS-2) in diverse human cancers.', 'Silencing of LASS2/TMSG1 enhances invasion and metastasis capacity of prostate cancer cell.', 'Silencing of tumor metastasis suppressor gene 1 promotes invasion of prostate cancer cell in vitro and its molecular mechanisms.', 'LASS2/TMSG1 gene silencing promotes the invasiveness and metastatic of human prostatic carcinoma cells through increase in vacuolar ATPase activity.', 'TMSG-1 and its roles in tumor biology.', 'Effect of Esomeprazole Treatment on Extracellular Tumor pH in a Preclinical Model of Prostate Cancer by MRI-CEST Tumor pH Imaging.', 'Downregulation of miRNA-205 Expression and Biological Mechanism in Prostate Cancer Tumorigenesis and Bone Metastasis.', 'Evaluation of CERS2 Gene as a Potential Biomarker for Bladder Cancer.', 'Lipid droplet velocity is a microenvironmental sensor of aggressive tumors regulated by V-ATPase and PEDF.', 'Clinical and pathological significance of Homo sapiens ceramide synthase 2 (CerS-2) in diverse human cancers.']"""

However, the underlying mechanisms and the sequence of these changes remain to be fully elucidated. The tumor suppressor gene RARRES1 (TIG1) is frequently hypermethylated in several cancers. Having noted changes in the expression of its paralogous neighbor gene LXN at 3q25.32, we used pyrosequencing to quantify DNA methylation at both genes and determine its relationship with clinicopathological parameters in 86 prostate cancer tissues from radical prostatectomies. Methylation at LXN and RARRES1 was highly correlated. Increasing methylation was associated with worse clinical features, including biochemical recurrence, and decreased expression of both genes. However, expression of three neighboring genes was unaffected. Intriguingly, RARRES1 methylation was influenced by the genotype of the rs6441224 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in its promoter. We found that this SNP is located within an ETS-family-response element and that the more strongly methylated allele confers lower activity in reporter assays. Concomitant methylation of RARRES1 and LXN in cancerous tissues was also detected in prostate cancer cell lines and was shown to be associated with repressive histone modifications and transcriptional downregulation.

Recently, a phase I study aimed at defining a biologically active dose reported the first response to an Hsp90 inhibitor in a patient with prostate cancer, which supports the development of new generation compounds for this disease.  Experimental design:   The biological actions of two new synthetic Hsp90 inhibitors, NVP-AUY922 and NVP-HSP990, were evaluated in the prostate cancer cell lines PC-3, LNCaP, and VCaP and in an ex vivo culture model of human prostate cancer.  Results:   In cell lines, both NVP-AUY922 and NVP-HSP990 showed greater potency than 17-AAG with regard to modulation of Hsp90 client proteins, inhibition of proliferation, and induction of apoptotic cell death. In prostate tumors obtained from radical prostatectomy that were cultured ex vivo, treatment with 500 nmol/L of NVP-AUY922, NVP-HSP990, or 17-AAG caused equivalent target modulation, determined by the pharmacodynamic marker Hsp70, but only NVP-AUY922 and NVP-HSP990 showed antiproliferative and proapoptotic activity.  Conclusions:   This study provides some of the first evidence that new generation Hsp90 inhibitors are capable of achieving biologic responses in human prostate tumors, with both NVP-AUY922 and NVP-HSP990 showing potent on-target efficacy.

In this study, we used a probe compound for an FGFR inhibitor, which potently inhibits FGFR-1-3 and significantly inhibits FGFR-4. The purpose of this study is to determine whether targeting FGFR signaling from all four FGFRs will have in vitro activities consistent with inhibition of tumor progression and will inhibit tumor progression in vivo.  Experimental design:   Effects of AZ8010 on FGFR signaling and invasion were analyzed using immortalized normal prostate epithelial (PNT1a) cells and PNT1a overexpressing FGFR-1 or FGFR-4. The effect of AZ8010 on invasion and proliferation in vitro was also evaluated in prostate cancer cell lines. Finally, the impact of AZ8010 on tumor progression in vivo was evaluated using a VCaP xenograft model.  Results:   AZ8010 completely inhibits FGFR-1 and significantly inhibits FGFR-4 signaling at 100 nmol/L, which is an achievable in vivo concentration. This results in marked inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation and invasion in PNT1a cells expressing FGFR-1 and FGFR-4 and all prostate cancer cell lines tested. Treatment in vivo completely inhibited VCaP tumor growth and significantly inhibited angiogenesis and proliferation and increased cell death in treated tumors.

L-dopa decarboxylase (DDC) has been documented as a novel co-activator of androgen receptor transcriptional activity. Recently, it was shown that DDC gene expression is significantly higher in patients with PCa than in those with BPH. In the present study, there was a significant association between the DDC gene expression levels and the pathological stage and Gleason score of patients with prostate cancer (PCa). Moreover, DDC expression was shown to be an unfavourable prognostic marker of biochemical recurrence and disease-free survival in patients with PCa treated by radical prostatectomy.  Objective:   To determine whether L-dopa decarboxylase gene (DDC) expression levels in patients with prostate cancer (PCa) correlate to biochemical recurrence and disease prognosis after radical prostatectomy (RP).  Patients and methods:   The present study consisted of 56 samples with confirmed malignancy from patients with PCa who had undergone RP at a single tertiary academic centre. Total RNA was isolated from tissue specimens and a SYBR Green fluorescence-based quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction methodology was developed for the determination of DDC mRNA expression levels of the tested tissues. Follow-up time ranged between 1.0 and 62.0 months (mean ± SE, 28.6 ± 2.1 month; median, 31.5 months). Time to biochemical recurrence was defined as the interval between the surgery and the measurement of two consecutive values of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) ≥0.2 ng/mL.  Results:   DDC expression levels were found to be positively correlated with the tumour-node-metastasis stage (P = 0.021) and Gleason score (P = 0.036) of the patients with PCa. Patients with PCa with raised DDC expression levels run a significantly higher risk of biochemical recurrence after RP, as indicated by Cox proportional regression analysis (P = 0.021). Multivariate Cox proportional regression models revealed the preoperative PSA-, age- and digital rectal examination-independent prognostic value of DDC expression for the prediction of disease-free survival (DFS) among patients with PCa (P = 0.036). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis confirms the significantly shorter DFS after RP of PCa with higher DDC expression levels (P = 0.015).  Conclusions:   This is the first study indicating the potential of DDC expression as a novel prognostic biomarker in patients with PCa who have undergone RP. For further evaluation and clinical application of the findings of the present study, a direct analysis of mRNA and/or its protein expression level in preoperative biopsy, blood serum and urine should be conducted.""","""['Georgios Koutalellis', 'Konstantinos Stravodimos', 'Margaritis Avgeris', 'Konstantinos Mavridis', 'Andreas Scorilas', 'Andreas Lazaris', 'Constantinos Constantinides']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Overexpression of high mobility group box 1 with poor prognosis in patients after radical prostatectomy.', 'Expression analysis and clinical utility of L-Dopa decarboxylase (DDC) in prostate cancer.', 'Radical prostatectomy improves progression-free and cancer-specific survival in men with lymph node positive prostate cancer in the prostate-specific antigen era: a confirmatory study.', 'Debulking surgery in the setting of very high-risk prostate cancer scenarios.', 'Molecular characteristic and physiological role of DOPA-decarboxylase.', 'Multi-omics profiles refine L-dopa decarboxylase (DDC) as a reliable biomarker for prognosis and immune microenvironment of clear cell renal cell carcinoma.', 'Reference-free transcriptome signatures for prostate cancer prognosis.', 'Revised Exon Structure of l-DOPA Decarboxylase (DDC) Reveals Novel Splice Variants Associated with Colorectal Cancer Progression.', 'Non-coding RNAs: the riddle of the transcriptome and their perspectives in cancer.', 'ORTI: An Open-Access Repository of Transcriptional Interactions for Interrogating Mammalian Gene Expression Data.']"""

There appears to be a clear difference in cancer control outcomes for patients with Gleason scores of 3+4 and those with scores of 4+3 after radical prostatectomy. It has been documented that patients with Gleason 4+3 prostate cancer have higher incidences of non-organ-confined disease than those with primary pattern 3. Higher rates of extracapsular extension, seminal vesicle invasion and positive margins have been found to be associated with primary pattern 4 over 3. These higher rates of non-organ-confined disease can lead to increased biochemical failure, which, in turn, can lead to higher mortality rates. This study provides information on the prognostic significance of primary Gleason pattern in the brachytherapy management of prostate cancer. Study Type - Prognosis (case series) Level of Evidence 4.  Objectives:   • To report the biochemical outcomes for Gleason 7 prostate cancer treated with brachytherapy. • To analyse the impact of the primary Gleason pattern as well as other disease- and treatment-related factors on outcome.  Patients and methods:   • A total of 560 patients with Gleason 7 prostate cancer were treated between 1990 and 2008 with brachytherapy, alone or in combination with hormonal therapy and/or external beam radiation therapy. • There were 352 patients with Gleason pattern 3+4 and 208 with Gleason pattern 4+3. • The mean (range) presenting PSA level was 11.2 (1-300) ng/mL, and the median was 7.8 ng/mL. • The presenting clinical stages were T1b in 1%, T1c in 33%, T2a in 16%, T2b in 32%, T2c in 16% and T3 in 2% of patients.  Results:   • The actuarial freedom from biochemical failure rate at 10 years was 82%. • There was no significant difference between 10-year freedom from biochemical failure rates for patients with Gleason scores of 3+4 (79%) and those with scores of 4+3 (82%). • Biologically effective dose and presenting PSA level were both significant predictors of biochemical failure in multivariate analysis.  Conclusions:   • The primary Gleason pattern in Gleason 7 prostate cancer shows no significant effect on biochemical failure when treated with brachytherapy. • These results are different from those found after radical prostatectomy and are probably attributable to the enhanced local control afforded by a brachytherapy approach to this disease subset.""","""['Richard G Stock', 'Joshua Berkowitz', 'Seth R Blacksburg', 'Nelson N Stone']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Relationship between percent positive biopsies and biochemical outcome after permanent interstitial brachytherapy for clinically organ-confined carcinoma of the prostate gland.', 'Biochemical outcomes after prostate brachytherapy with 5-year minimal follow-up: importance of patient selection and implant quality.', 'PSA nadir of <0.5 ng/mL following brachytherapy for early-stage prostate adenocarcinoma is associated with freedom from prostate-specific antigen failure.', 'Preliminary toxicity and prostate-specific antigen response of a Phase I/II trial of neoadjuvant hormonal therapy, 103Pd brachytherapy, and three-dimensional conformal external beam irradiation in the treatment of locally advanced prostate cancer.', 'Management of localised prostate cancer: watchful waiting, surgery or radiation therapy, depending on the natural course, which is often relatively slow.', 'High Intensity Focused Ultrasound versus Brachytherapy for the Treatment of Localized Prostate Cancer: A Matched-Pair Analysis.', '125Iodine monotherapy for Japanese men with low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancer: outcomes after 5 years of follow-up.']"""

Method:   Between January 2007 and June 2009, a total of 47 operations on 46 patients were performed and reviewed retrospectively. All patients had perioperative clinical assessment, hormonal profile and magnetic resonance imaging studies for residual/recurrent disease. The collaborative model utilized two neurosurgeons with experience in the microsurgical resection of pituitary tumours: an endoscopic skull base fellowship trained rhinologist and an endoscopic skull base rhinologist with more experience who visited twice a year from Adelaide, Australia.  Results:   The pathology results included: 30 non-functioning pituitary adenomas, 10 secreting pituitary adenomas, 3 meningiomas, 1 chordoma, 1 anterior skull base adenocarcinoma and 1 clival prostate metastasis. Complete tumour resection was intended and achieved in 38 cases. All 10 patients with secreting adenomas achieved improvement of hormonal profile. Nineteen out of 27 cases demonstrated improvement of vision. Perioperative complications included one epistaxis, three cerebrospinal fluid fistulae, one delayed chronic subdural haematoma and one persistent diabetes insipidus.

This study examined the utility of a comprehensive psychosocial screening tool to identify psychosocial traits that prospectively predict HrQoL status among men treated for localized prostate cancer. The Millon Behavioral Medicine Diagnostic (MBMD) was administered to 66 men (M age = 68 years, 59% White) treated by either radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy along with standard measures of general and prostate-cancer-specific quality of life assessed at a 12-month follow-up. Higher scores on both summary MBMD Management Guides (Adjustment Difficulties and Psych Referral) and higher scores on personality styles characterized by avoidance, dependency, depression, passive aggressiveness, and self-denigration predicted lower HrQoL (β range = -.21 to -.50). Additionally, higher scores on the MBMD Depression, Tension-Anxiety, and Future Pessimism scales predicted lower HrQoL. Finally, higher scores on the MBMD Intervention Fragility and Utilization Excess scale also consistently predicted poorer mental and physical health functioning over time.

Methods:   The physicochemical characterization of the association between RF and CDs was performed by UV-vis absorption, fluorescence, differential scanning calorimetry and NMR techniques. Molecular dynamics simulation was used to shed light on the mechanism of interaction of RF and CDs. Additionally, in-vitro cell culture tests were performed to evaluate the cytotoxicity of the RF-CD complexes against prostate cancer cells.  Key findings:   Neither βCD nor HPβCD led to substantial changes in the physicochemical properties of RF (with the exception of solubility). Additionally, rotating frame Overhauser effect spectroscopy experiments detected no spatial correlations between hydrogens from the internal cavity of CDs and RF, while molecular dynamics simulations revealed 'out-of-ring' RF-CD interactions. Notwithstanding, both RF-βCD and RF-HPβCD complexes were cytotoxic to PC3 prostate cancer cells.  Conclusions:   The interaction between RF and either βCD or HPβCD, at low concentrations, seems to be made through hydrogen bonding between the flavonoid and the external rim of both CDs.

Mutagenesis of the Chk2 phosphorylation sites enhanced the stability of survivin-ΔEx3 in tumor cells, inhibited the expression of phosphorylated H2AX (γH2AX) in response to double-strand DNA breaks, and impaired growth after DNA damage. DNA damage induced Chk2 phosphorylation, stabilization of p53, induction of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21, and homologous recombination-induced repair were not affected.

Transgenic MYC expression drives invasive adenocarcinomas in the murine prostate. We show that overexpression of USP2a downregulates a set of microRNAs that collectively increase MYC levels by MDM2 deubiquitination and subsequent p53 inactivation. By establishing MYC as a target of miR-34b/c, we demonstrate that this cluster functions as a tumor suppressor in prostate cancer cells. We identify a distinct mRNA signature that is enriched for MYC-regulated transcripts and transcription factor binding sites in USP2a overexpressing prostate cancer cells. We demonstrate that these genes are associated with an invasive phenotype in human prostate cancer and that the proliferative and invasive properties of USP2a overexpressing cells are MYC-dependent. These results highlight an unrecognized mechanism of MYC regulation in prostate cancer and suggest alternative therapeutic strategies in targeting MYC.  Significance:   The deubiquitinating enzyme USP2a has previously been shown to be oncogenic, overexpressed in almost half of human prostate adenocarcinomas, and prolongs the half-life of targets such as fatty acid synthase, MDM2, and cyclin D1. Here, we highlight a new mechanism by which USP2a enhances MYC levels through the modulation of specific subsets of microRNAs in prostate cancer, suggesting alternative therapeutic strategies for targeting MYC.""","""['Barbara Benassi', 'Richard Flavin', 'Luigi Marchionni', 'Silvio Zanata', 'Yunfeng Pan', 'Dipanjan Chowdhury', 'Marina Marani', 'Sabrina Strano', 'Paola Muti', 'Giovanni Blandino', 'Massimo Loda']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Cancer Discov""","""['USP2a activation of MYC in prostate cancer.', 'USP2a activation of MYC in prostate cancer.', 'USP2a alters chemotherapeutic response by modulating redox.', 'The isopeptidase USP2a protects human prostate cancer from apoptosis.', 'Targeting RNA polymerase I to treat MYC-driven cancer.', 'Targeting MYC in cancer therapy: RNA processing offers new opportunities.', 'Dysregulation and oncogenic activities of ubiquitin specific peptidase 2a in the pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'The role of E3 ubiquitin ligases and deubiquitinases in bladder cancer development and immunotherapy.', 'Ubiquitin specific peptidases and prostate cancer.', 'Role of ubiquitin specific proteases in the immune microenvironment of prostate cancer: A new direction.', 'CKAP2L, a crucial target of miR-326, promotes prostate cancer progression.']"""

Methods:   From the statistical power of published genome-wide association studies, we estimated the number of undetected susceptibility loci and the distribution of effect sizes for all cancers. Assuming a log-normal model for risks and multiplicative relative risks for SNPs, family history (FH), and known risk factors, we estimated the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and the proportion of patients with risks above risk thresholds for screening. From additional prevalence data, we estimated the positive predictive value and the ratio of non-patient cases to patient cases (false-positive ratio) for various risk thresholds.  Results:   Age-specific discriminatory accuracy (AUC) for models including FH and foreseeable SNPs ranged from 0.575 for ovarian cancer to 0.694 for prostate cancer. The proportions of patients in the highest decile of population risk ranged from 16.2% for ovarian cancer to 29.4% for prostate cancer. The corresponding false-positive ratios were 241 for colorectal cancer, 610 for ovarian cancer, and 138 or 280 for breast cancer in women age 50 to 54 or 40 to 44 years, respectively.

We evaluated the value of this test in patients undergoing initial and repeat prostate biopsy.  Methods:   PCA3 and PSA levels were obtained from 456 men with no known personal history of prostate cancer prior to prostate biopsy. Two hundred eighty-nine men underwent an initial prostate biopsy and 167 underwent a repeat prostate biopsy. PCA3 and PSA levels were compared to the prostate biopsy results.  Results:   PCA3 score was shown to be independent of prostate volume (P = 0.162) and PSA level (P = 0.959). PCA3 scores were significantly higher in patients with cancer on prostate biopsy compared to patients with negative biopsy results (P < 0.0001). In logistic regression, PCA3 showed a significantly higher AUC than PSA (0.726 vs. 0.512, P = 0.0001). This difference persisted when examining the initial biopsy subgroup, with PCA3 out-performing PSA (AUC 0.772 vs. AUC = 0.552, P < 0.0001), but not in the repeat biopsy subgroup (AUC = 0.605 vs. AUC = 0.500, P = 0.2488).

Methods:   From January 2004 to May 2011, 3,107 patients underwent transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) prostate biopsies due to elevated PSA levels ranging between 3 and 20 ng/ml or abnormal digital rectal exams (DREs). Multivariate logistic analysis was used to assess the potential association of LUTS and PCa detection via biopsy. The predictive accuracy of the multivariate model was assessed based on the receiver operating characteristics-derived area under the curve.  Results:   The median International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) was 11, and the mean PSA was 6.81 ng/ml. Of the total subjects, PCa was detected from biopsy in 931 (30.0%) patients. In a comparison of 1,465 patients with IPSS ≥ 11 and 1,642 patients with IPSS <11, those with a higher IPSS were older, had higher PSA and had a larger prostate, but there were no significant differences in the PCa detection rates. However, in multivariate analysis incorporating other associated variables, a higher IPSS was significantly associated with lower odds of PCa detection (P = 0.016). Nevertheless, addition of the IPSS did not significantly increase the accuracy of the multivariate model devised for the detection of PCa (P = 0.098).

Part of its effect on tumor cells is related to the cellular pro-oxidative imbalance provoked by the generation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) through naphthoquinone redox cycling. In this study, we attempted to find new naphthoquinone derivatives that would increase the efficiency of H2O2 production, thereby potentially increasing its efficacy for cancer treatment. The presence of an electron-withdrawing group in the naphthoquinone moiety had a direct effect on the efficiency of H2O2 production. The compound 2-bromo-1,4-naphthoquinone (BrQ), in which the bromine atom substituted the methyl group in VK3, was approximately 10- and 19-fold more efficient than VK3 in terms of oxygen consumption and H2O2 production, respectively. The ratio [H2O2]produced / [naphthoquinone]consumed was 68 ± 11 and 5.8 ± 0.2 (µM/µM) for BrQ and VK3, respectively, indicating a higher efficacy of BrQ as a catalyst for the autoxidation of ascorbic acid. Both VK3 and BrQ reacted with glutathione (GSH), but BrQ was the more effective substrate. Part of GSH was incorporated into the naphthoquinone, producing a nucleophilic substitution product (Q-SG). The depletion of BrQ by GSH did not prevent its redox capacity since Q-SG was also able to catalyze the production of reactive oxygen species. VK3/VC has already been submitted to clinical trials for the treatment of prostate cancer and has demonstrated promising results.

RM-1 cells were actively injected into the femoral bone cavity, leading to bilateral dissymmetry of bone density in the femoral bone. Tumor cells were also detected in bone tissue by pathological examination. The impact on bone density was demonstrated by the significant difference between animals injected with RM-PSMA cells (0.0738 ± 0.0185 g/cm²) and animals injected with RM-empty plasmid cells (0.0895 ± 0.0241 g/cm²). The lytic bone lesion of the RM-PSMA group (68.4%) was higher than that of the control group (27.8%). Immunohistochemistry showed that the expression of both vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) was distinctly higher in the RM-PSMA group than in the control group, while ELISA and Western blot assay indicated that VEGF and MMP-9 were higher in the RM-PSMA group compared to the control group (in vitro). Thus, the present study proposed and then confirmed for the first time that PSMA can promote in vivo osseous metastasis of PCa by increasing sclerotic destruction of PCa cells.

Regulation of AR transcriptional activity by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation by multiple kinases, is well documented. Here, we report that two PIM-1 kinase isoforms which are up-regulated during prostate cancer progression, namely PIM-1S and PIM-1L, modulate AR stability and transcriptional activity through differentially phosphorylating AR at serine 213 (Ser-213) and threonine 850 (Thr-850). Although both kinases are capable of interacting with and phosphorylating AR at Ser-213, only PIM-1L could phosphorylate Thr-850. We also showed that PIM-1S induced Ser-213 phosphorylation destabilizes AR by recruiting the ubiquitin E3 ligase Mdm2 and promotes AR degradation in a cell cycle-dependent manner, while PIM-1L-induced Thr-850 phosphorylation stabilizes AR by recruiting the ubiquitin E3 ligase RNF6 and promotes AR-mediated transcription under low-androgen conditions. Furthermore, both PIM-1 isoforms could promote prostate cancer cell growth under low-androgen conditions. Our data suggest that these kinases regulate AR stability and transcriptional activity through recruitment of different functional partners in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. As AR turnover has been previously shown to be critical for cell cycle progression in prostate cancer cells, PIM-1 kinase isoforms may promote prostate cancer cell growth, at least in part, through modulating AR activity via distinct mechanisms.""","""['Douglas E Linn', 'Xi Yang', 'Yingqiu Xie', 'Alan Alfano', 'Dhanraj Deshmukh', 'Xin Wang', 'Hermela Shimelis', 'Hegang Chen', 'Wei Li', 'Kexin Xu', 'Mingyuan Chen', 'Yun Qiu']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""J Biol Chem""","""['p21-Activated kinase 6 (PAK6) inhibits prostate cancer growth via phosphorylation of androgen receptor and tumorigenic E3 ligase murine double minute-2 (Mdm2).', 'Attenuation of androgen receptor-dependent transcription by the serine/threonine kinase Pim-1.', 'Regulation of androgen receptor transcriptional activity and specificity by RNF6-induced ubiquitination.', 'Implications of ubiquitin ligases in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'p27(Kip1) signaling: Transcriptional and post-translational regulation.', 'Pim Kinases: Important Regulators of Cardiovascular Disease.', 'Urolithin A analog inhibits castration-resistant prostate cancer by targeting the androgen receptor and its variant, androgen receptor-variant 7.', 'A hotspot for posttranslational modifications on the androgen receptor dimer interface drives pathology and anti-androgen resistance.', 'Mechanisms and targeting of proteosome-dependent androgen receptor degradation in prostate cancer.', 'Choosing Kinase Inhibitors for Androgen Deprivation Therapy-Resistant Prostate Cancer.']"""

Because a plateau has been reached in the development of taxane-based treatments for prostate cancer, this study was undertaken to evaluate the relative efficacy of targeting telomeres and microtubules in taxane-sensitive, taxane-resistant, androgen-sensitive, and androgen-insensitive prostate cancer cells. Paclitaxel- and docetaxel-resistant DU145 cells were developed and their underlying adaptive responses were evaluated. Telomere dynamics and the effects of targeting telomeres with sodium meta-arsenite (KML001) (an agent undergoing early clinical trials), including combinations with paclitaxel and docetaxel, were evaluated in parental and drug-resistant cells. The studies were extended to androgen-sensitive LNCaP cells and androgen-insensitive LNCaP/C81 cells. Both P-glycoprotein (Pgp)-dependent and non-Pgp-dependent mechanisms of resistance were recruited within the same population of DU145 cells with selection for drug resistance. Wild-type DU145 cells have a small side population (SP) (0.4-1.2%). The SP fraction increased with increasing drug resistance, which was correlated with enhanced expression of Pgp but not breast cancer resistance protein. Telomere dynamics remained unchanged in taxane-resistant cells, which retained sensitivity to KML001. Furthermore, KML001 targeted SP and non-SP fractions, inducing DNA damage signaling in both fractions. KML001 induced telomere erosion, decreased telomerase gene expression, and was highly synergistic with the taxanes in wild-type and drug-resistant DU145 cells. This synergism extended to androgen-sensitive and androgen-insensitive LNCaP cells under basal and androgen-deprived conditions.

On average, each patient had three correction times during one fraction treatment. The radiation dose is about 3 mSv per fraction. With the ExacTrac 6D X-ray system, the prostate IMRT treatment with marker implanted can achieve less than 2 mm setup uncertainty in translations, and less than 0.25° in rotations as overall interfraction mean error.

Currently, in Brazil, the seeds are imported with high prices, which prohibit their use in public hospitals. A ceramic matrix that can be used as a radioisotope carrier and radiographic marker was developed at our institution. The ceramic matrix is distinguished by the characteristic of maintaining the radioactive material uniformly distributed in its surface. In this work, Monte Carlo simulations were performed in order to assess the dose distributions generated by this prototype seed model, with the ceramic matrix encapsulated in titanium, in the same way as the commercial 6711 seed. The obtained data was assessed, as described in the TG-43U1 report by the American Association of Physicists in Medicine, for two seed models: (1) the most used model 6711 source - for validation and comparison, and (2) for the prototype model with the ceramic matrix. The dosimetric parameters dose rate constant, Λ, radial dose function, gL(r), and anisotropy function, F(r,θ), were derived from simulations by the Monte Carlo method using the MCNP5 code. A Λ 0.992 (± 2.33%) cGyh-1U-1 was found for the prototype model. In comparison with the 6711 model, a lower dose fall-off on transverse axis was found, as well as a lower dose anisotropy for the radius r = 0.25 cm. In general, for all distances, the prototype seed model presents a slightly larger anisotropy between 0° ≤ Θ < 50° and anisotropy similar to the 6711 model for Θ ≥ 50°. The dosimetric characteristics of the prototype model presented in this study suggest that its use is feasible. Because of the model's characteristics, seeds of lower specific activity iodine might be necessary which, on the other hand, would help to reduce costs. However, it has to be emphasized that the proposed source is a prototype, and the required (AAPM prerequisites) experimental study and tolerance manufacturer values are pending for future studies.""","""['Lucas Paixão', 'Alessandro Facure', 'Ana Maria M Santos', 'Adriano Márcio dos Santos', 'Suely Epsztein Grynberg']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""J Appl Clin Med Phys""","""['Monte Carlo calculations and experimental measurements of the TG-43U1-recommended dosimetric parameters of 125I (Model IR-Seed2) brachytherapy source.', 'Monte Carlo calculated TG-43 dosimetry parameters for the SeedLink 125Iodine brachytherapy system.', 'Investigation of the dosimetric parameters of 125I BEBIG IsoSeed® I25.S06 source: GATE 8.2 Monte Carlo code.', 'An experimental palladium-103 seed (OptiSeedexp) in a biocompatible polymer without a gold marker: characterization of dosimetric parameters including the interseed effect.', 'A modern Monte Carlo investigation of the TG-43 dosimetry parameters for an 125I seed already having AAPM consensus data.']"""

In this treatment planning study, the effects of intra- and interfractional organ motion on PBS dose distributions are investigated using repeated CT scans at close and distant time intervals. The minimum dose (Dmin) and the dose to 2% and 98% of the volumes (D2% and D98%), as well as EUD in the clinical target volumes (CTV), is used as measure of robustness. In all patients, D98% was larger than 96% and D2% was less than 106% of the prescribed dose. The combined information from Dmin, D98% and EUD led to the conclusion that there are no relevant cold spots observed in any of the verification plans.

Prostate growth is ruled by testosterone. Nevertheless, the paradigm that high testosterone levels induce prostate cancer development or lead to a poor prognosis in prostate cancer is not supported by evidence. A growing number of studies suggest that, on the contrary, low testosterone levels are related to poor prognosis features in prostate cancer such as higher prostate-specific antigen or higher Gleason score. Our experience shows that testosterone levels are related to risk of progression of prostate cancer - those men with lower testosterone levels are at higher risk of progression of their prostate cancer after treatment delivery.  Objectives:   • Low testosterone levels have been related to a higher diagnosis of prostate cancer (PCa). Hormonal levels have been related to poor prognosis factors in men with PCa, mainly after radical prostatectomy. • Our aim was to determine the relationship between hormonal levels and PCa prognosis factors in men with PCa prior to the onset of treatment.  Patients and methods:   • We prospectively analysed 137 males diagnosed in our centre with PCa with 5+5 core prostate biopsies from February 2007 to December 2009. • As part of our clinical protocol, we performed hormonal determination (testosterone and sex hormone binding globulin) following International Society of Andrology, International Society for the Study of the Aging Male and European Association of Urology recommendations. • Free testosterone and bioavailable testosterone were calculated using Vermeulen's formula. • Age, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), free to total PSA, PSA density, number of previous biopsies, digital rectal examination staging, Gleason score, percentage of tumour in the biopsy sample, bilaterality of the tumour and risk of progression group were prospectively recorded.  Results:   • Higher testosterone levels were related to lower digital rectal examination staging (P= 0.02) and lower PSA level (P= 0.05). Higher testosterone was not related to lower Gleason score (P= 0.08). • Testosterone was inversely related to PCa bilaterality (P < 0.01) and percentage of tumour in the biopsy (P < 0.01). • High testosterone levels were found in patients allocated to the low risk of progression group and inversely (P= 0.03). • In multivariate analysis, higher age and lower testosterone were related to higher D'Amico risk of progression.  Conclusion:   • Patients with PCa and lower testosterone levels have poor prognosis factors and higher tumour burden before treatment onset. These findings reinforce the idea that low testosterone levels pretreatment are related to a poor prognosis in PCa.""","""['Eduardo García-Cruz', 'Marta Piqueras', 'Jorge Huguet', 'Lluis Peri', 'Laura Izquierdo', 'Mireia Musquera', 'Agustin Franco', 'Ricardo Alvarez-Vijande', 'Maria Jose Ribal', 'Antonio Alcaraz']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Low testosterone levels are related to poor prognosis factors in men with prostate cancer prior to treatment.', 'Low testosterone level predicts prostate cancer in re-biopsy in patients with high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia.', 'Higher sex hormone-binding globulin and lower bioavailable testosterone are related to prostate cancer detection on prostate biopsy.', 'Low pretreatment serum total testosterone is associated with a high incidence of Gleason score 8-10 disease in prostatectomy specimens: data from ethnic Chinese patients with localized prostate cancer.', 'Management of localised prostate cancer: watchful waiting, surgery or radiation therapy, depending on the natural course, which is often relatively slow.', 'Prostate biopsy: who, how and when.

There are a lot of potential prostate cancer biomarkers being evaluated. All aim to improve on the sensitivity and specificity of PSA. EN2 was recently shown by our group to have better sensitivity and specificity than PSA. EN2 is a simple ELISA test and is not dependent on other parameters, even PSA, unlike all the other current biomarkers under evaluation. To date, no marker correlates with the amount of cancer present - the present study shows this positive correlation with EN2 in men undergoing prostatectomy. The potential utility of this work is that by knowing that the level of EN2 corresponds to the amount of cancer present, irrelevant of tumour grade and number of cancer foci, we can define an EN2 level corresponding to small cancers, which can then undergo surveillance. We are conducting a further study that is aimed at determining whether the levels of EN2 in urine can indicate 'significant' vs 'non-significant cancer' using the threshold of 0.5 mL cancer (after Epstein's work).  Objectives:   To evaluate the relationship between levels of a recently described prostate cancer biomarker engrailed-2 (EN2) in urine and cancer volume in men who had undergone radical prostatectomy (RP) for prostate cancer. To date, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels have not reliably predicted prostate cancer volume. Reliable volume indicator biomarker(s) may aid management decisions, e.g. active treatment vs active surveillance.  Patients and methods:   Archived patient samples from the Aarhus Prostate Cancer Project, Denmark, were assessed. Pre-treatment mid-stream urines, without preceding prostatic massage, were collected and stored at -80 °C. Urinary EN2 levels were measured by a recently published enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.  Results:   In all, 88 of the whole cohort of 125 men (70%) were positive for EN2 in their urine (>42.5 µg/L); 38/58 (65%) men where cancer volume data was available. There was no statistical relationship between urinary EN2 levels and serum PSA levels. PSA levels did not correlate with tumour stage, combined Gleason grade, total prostatic weight or cancer volume. There was a strong statistical relationship between urinary EN2 and prostate cancer volume by linear regression (P = 0.006). Higher EN2 levels correlated with tumour stage T1 vs T2 (P = 0.027).  Conclusions:   Pre-surgical urinary EN2 levels were associated with increasing tumour stage and closely reflected the volume of cancer in RP specimens. Given the ease of collection (no prostatic massage required) and the simplicity, low cost and robustness of the assay, EN2 may become a useful biomarker in not only identifying which patients have prostate cancer but may also facilitate risk stratification by indicating the burden of tumour volume.""","""['Hardev Pandha', 'Karen D Sorensen', 'Thorsten F Orntoft', 'Stephen Langley', 'Soren Hoyer', 'Michael Borre', 'Richard Morgan']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['The ability of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) density to predict an upgrade in Gleason score between initial prostate biopsy and prostatectomy diminishes with increasing tumour grade due to reduced PSA secretion per unit tumour volume.', 'Engrailed-2 protein as a potential urinary prostate cancer biomarker: a comparison study before and after digital rectal examination.', 'Tumour volume is an independent predictor of prostate-specific antigen recurrence in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy for clinically localized prostate cancer.', 'EN2 in Prostate Cancer.', 'EN2: a novel prostate cancer biomarker.', 'A simple urine test by 3D-plus-3D immunoassay guides precise in vitro cancer diagnosis.', 'Aptamer-antibody hybrid ELONA that uses hybridization chain reaction to detect a urinary biomarker EN2 for bladder and prostate cancer.', 'Integration of Urinary EN2 Protein & Cell-Free RNA Data in the Development of a Multivariable Risk Model for the Detection of Prostate Cancer Prior to Biopsy.', 'Integrin Alpha V in Urine: A Novel Noninvasive Marker for Prostate Cancer Detection.', 'Altered staining patterns and expression level of Engrailed-2 in benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate Cancer predict prostatic disease progression.']"""

Our previous reports showed that knocking down the expression of the AR gene using a siRNA-based approach in prostate cancer cells led to apoptotic cell death and xenograft tumor eradication. In this study, we utilized a biodegradable nanoparticle to deliver the therapeutic AR shRNA construct specifically to prostate cancer cells.  Materials & methods:   The biodegradable nanoparticles were fabricated using a poly(dl-lactic-co-glycolic acid) polymer and the AR shRNA constructs were loaded inside the particles. The surface of the nanoparticles were then conjugated with prostate-specific membrane antigen aptamer A10 for prostate cancer cell-specific targeting.  Results:   A10-conjugation largely enhanced cellular uptake of nanoparticles in both cell culture- and xenograft-based models. The efficacy of AR shRNA encapsulated in nanoparticles on AR gene silencing was confirmed in PC-3/AR-derived xenografts in nude mice. The therapeutic property of A10-conjugated AR shRNA-loaded nanoparticles was evaluated in xenograft models with different prostate cancer cell lines: 22RV1, LAPC-4 and LNCaP. Upon two injections of the AR shRNA-loaded nanoparticles, rapid tumor regression was observed over 2 weeks. Consistent with previous reports, A10 aptamer conjugation significantly enhanced xenograft tumor regression compared with nonconjugated nanoparticles.

We compared the results of applying two different analytical methods--the traditional human capital approach (HCA) and the emerging friction cost approach (FCA)--to estimate breast and prostate cancer productivity costs in Ireland in 2008.  Methods:   Data from a survey of breast and prostate cancer patients were combined with population-level survival estimates and a national wage data set to calculate costs of temporary disability (cancer-related work absence), permanent disability (workforce departure, reduced working hours), and premature mortality.  Results:   For breast cancer, productivity costs per person using the HCA were € 193,425 and those per person using the FCA were € 8,103; for prostate cancer, the comparable estimates were € 109,154 and € 8,205, respectively. The HCA generated higher costs for younger patients (breast cancer) because of greater lifetime earning potential. In contrast, the FCA resulted in higher productivity costs for older male patients (prostate cancer) commensurate with higher earning capacity over a shorter time period. Reduced working hours postcancer was a key driver of total HCA productivity costs. HCA costs were sensitive to assumptions about discount and growth rates. FCA costs were sensitive to assumptions about the friction period.  Conclusions:   The magnitude of the estimates obtained in this study illustrates the importance of including productivity costs when considering the economic impact of illness. Vastly different results emerge from the application of the HCA and the FCA, and this finding emphasizes the importance of choosing the study perspective carefully and being explicit about assumptions that underpin the methods.""","""['Paul Hanly', 'Aileen Timmons', 'Paul M Walsh', 'Linda Sharp']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Value Health""","""['Productivity Losses Associated with Head and Neck Cancer Using the Human Capital and Friction Cost Approaches.', 'Valuing productivity costs in a changing macroeconomic environment: the estimation of colorectal cancer productivity costs using the friction cost approach.', 'Variation in the methodological approach to productivity cost valuation: the case of prostate cancer.', 'Friction Cost Estimates of Productivity Costs in Cost-of-Illness Studies in Comparison with Human Capital Estimates: A Review.', 'The value of productivity: human-capital versus friction-cost method.', 'Estimating Global Friction Periods for Economic Evaluation: A Case Study of Selected OECD Member Countries.', 'Cost of illness in a super-aged society-comparison of breast, lung, and prostate cancer in Japan.', 'A systemmatic literature review on indirect costs of women with breast cancer.', 'The Cost of Von Willebrand Disease in Europe: The CVESS Study.', 'Estimating Productivity Loss from Breast and Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer among Working-Age Patients and Unpaid Caregivers: A Survey Study Using the Multiplier Method.']"""

We previously reported on a number of androgen-dependent advanced prostate cancer (PCa) patients in which serum alpha2-macroglobulin (alpha2M) levels were markedly decreased to < 20 mg/dL (defined as alpha2M deficiency). Anti-androgen therapy is at first generally very effective for androgen-dependent advanced PCa, yielding survival benefits for most patients. In the present study, we evaluated serum levels of PSA, matrix metalloproteinases-2 (MMP-2), alpha2M, and alpha2-plasmin inhibitor (alpha2PI) in advanced PCa patients with or without alpha2M deficiency in order to determine the clinical significance of these proteases and proteinase inhibitors for PCa progression.  Methods:   In this study, 33 PCa patients were diagnosed at the Kitasato University Hospital and compared with 10 healthy controls. PSA and MMP-2 levels were determined by enzyme immunoassay. Measurement of alpha2M was performed by laser-nephelometry, alpha2PI levels were determined by turbidimetric immunoassay.  Results:   Serum levels of PSA and MMP-2 in PCa patients with alpha2M deficiency were significantly higher than in patients not alpha2M-deficient. In contrast, serum levels of alpha2M and alpha2PI in these patients were significantly lower than in those not alpha2M-deficient. PSA and alpha2M levels showed an inverse relationship in androgen-dependent advanced PCa with alpha2M deficiency.  Conclusions:   Our findings indicate that the serum levels of these proteases and proteinase inhibitors, which are involved in the invasion and metastasis of PCa, may be indicators of PCa disease progression in addition to PSA levels.""","""['Yuhsaku Kanoh', 'Hideki Ohtani', 'Shin Egawa', 'Shiro Baba', 'Tohru Akahoshi']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Clin Lab""","""['Clinicopathological characteristics of androgen-dependent advanced prostate cancer patients with α2-macroglobulin deficiency.', 'Levels of acute inflammatory biomarkers in advanced prostate cancer patients with α2-macroglobulin deficiency.', 'Associations of IgG N-linked oligosaccharide chains and proteases in sera of prostate cancer patients with and without alpha2-macroglobulin deficiency.', 'Immunological background of plasma protein abnormalities--the relation between inflammation and malignant neoplasm.', 'Alpha-2-macroglobulin as a radioprotective agent: a review.', 'Effects of berberine hydrochloride on immune response in the crab Charybdis japonica.', 'Early supplemental α2-macroglobulin attenuates cartilage and bone damage by inhibiting inflammation in collagen II-induced arthritis model.', 'A repertoire of protease inhibitor families in Amblyomma americanum and other tick species: inter-species comparative analyses.']"""

However, this technique has multiple limitations owing to the operator's inability in most cases to directly visualize and target prostate lesions. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the prostate overcomes many of these limitations by directly depicting areas of abnormality and allowing targeted biopsies. Accuracy in the detection of prostate cancer is improved by the combined use of standard T2-weighted MR imaging and advanced MR imaging techniques such as diffusion-weighted imaging, dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging, and MR spectroscopy. Suspicious-appearing regions of the prostate seen on MR images can be targeted at real-time transrectal US-guided biopsy to improve the diagnostic yield. MR imaging also can be performed for real-time guidance of transrectal prostate biopsy. Studies among patients who underwent at least one transrectal US-guided biopsy with a negative result before undergoing an MR imaging-guided biopsy showed improved detection rates with MR imaging-guided biopsy in comparison with the detection rates achieved with a repeat transrectal US-guided biopsy; however, MR imaging-guided biopsy is a more time-consuming procedure. A technique known as fused MR imaging- and transrectal US-guided biopsy, which relies on the coregistration of previously acquired MR images with real-time transrectal US images acquired during the procedure, shows promise but is limited by deformation of the prostate; this limitation is the subject of ongoing investigation. Another technique that is currently under investigation, MR imaging-guided prostate biopsy with robotic assistance, may one day help improve the accuracy of biopsy needle placement.""","""['Joseph H Yacoub', 'Sadhna Verma', 'Jonathan S Moulton', 'Scott Eggener', 'Oto Aytekin']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Radiographics""","""['Feasibility of a pneumatically actuated MR-compatible robot for transrectal prostate biopsy guidance.', 'Areas suspicious for prostate cancer: MR-guided biopsy in patients with at least one transrectal US-guided biopsy with a negative finding--multiparametric MR imaging for detection and biopsy planning.', 'Thirty-two-channel coil 3T magnetic resonance-guided biopsies of prostate tumor suspicious regions identified on multimodality 3T magnetic resonance imaging: technique and feasibility.', 'MR imaging-guided prostate biopsy techniques.', 'MR-guided interventions for prostate cancer.', 'The Performance of FDA-Approved PET Imaging Agents in the Detection of Prostate Cancer.', 'Office-Based, Single-Sided, Low-Field MRI-Guided Prostate Biopsy.', 'Prostate cancer: diagnostic yield of modified transrectal ultrasound-guided twelve-core combined biopsy (targeted plus systematic biopsies) using prebiopsy magnetic resonance imaging.', 'A Prospective Study on the Efficacy of Cognitive Targeted Transrectal Ultrasound Prostate Biopsy in Diagnosing Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer.', 'Semi-automated PIRADS scoring via mpMRI analysis.']"""

Aim:   To produce a risk assessment model for PC based on familial background of related cancers.  Method:   976 859 independent index men aged ≥30 in year 1998 and their family members in the Swedish Family-Cancer Database (FCD2010) were randomly divided into development (60%) and validation (40%) datasets (follow-up=10 years). The HR from Cox model was used to extrapolate risk scores. Results Specified scores were: for PC in situ at age <60 years in index man, 5; for PC at age <60 years in each first-degree relative (FDR), 15; for PC at age ≥60 years in each FDR, 10; for PC at age <60 years in each second-degree relative, 5; for breast cancer in each FDR, 2; for oesophageal carcinoma in situ in index man, 2; and for oesophagus cancer in each FDR, 2. Based on the findings, if the milestone age for a PC screening programme was 60 years or more, the recommended starting age for the men with the score-group 6-10 would be 54 years; score-group 11-15, 52 years; score-group 16-20, 50 years; score-group 21-25, 44 years; and for the score-group 26+ it should start before age 40. The concordance index in development and validation sets was 0.885 (95% CI 0.883 to 0.888). No significant difference was found between curves from development and validation datasets (internally validated using twofold validation and bootstrapping).  Conclusion:   Familial history of relevant malignancies can be used as risk factors to estimate a man's prior risk of developing PC.

Similar to human prostate carcinogenesis, glutathione S-transferase P1 (GSTP1) expression was lost or partially lost in HgPIN. E-Cadherin expression was also lost in HgPIN. The expression of DNA methyltransferase 1 was elevated, possibly to enhance promoter hypermethylation for the silencing of GSTP1 and E-cadherin.

Recently, the alpha subunit of this dimeric hormone (inhibin‑α) was reported to be involved in prostate tumorigenesis. To identify additional roles outside the reproductive axis, we investigated inhibin‑α gene activity and subsequent cell fate in human gastric cancer cells. The results were as follows: all the gastric cancer cells had at least one of a set of abnormalities including hypermethylation of the promoter, mutation of the 5'‑UTR or allelic imbalance including LOH in the inhibin‑α gene. Hypermethylation of the promoter and mutation of the 5'‑UTR in inhibin‑α were observed in SNU‑1, SNU‑5 and SNU‑484 cells. LOH was observed in AGS, KATO III, SNU‑5, SNU‑484 and SNU‑668 cells. Treatment with 5‑AzaC, a demethylating agent, induced demethylation of the inhibin‑α promoter in the SNU‑1, SNU‑5 and SNU‑484 cell lines, with the CpG5 site being strongly influenced by 5‑AzaC. In addition, inhibin‑α mRNA and protein were maintained at low levels in most of the gastric cancer cell lines. These low levels of mRNA and protein expression could be increased in most lines by treatment with 5‑AzaC. These increased inhibin‑α expression levels seemed to be closely associated with apoptosis and suppression of cell growth. Taken together, our results reveal that the inhibin‑α gene is transcriptionally silenced in human gastric cancer cells, and that reactivation of the gene suppresses their growth characteristics. This suggests that inhibin‑α may have a more general tumor suppressor activity outside the reproductive axis.""","""['Young Il Kim', 'Jaejun Shim', 'Byung-Ho Kim', 'Sung Jae Lee', 'Ha Kyu Lee', 'Chunghee Cho', 'Byung-Nam Cho']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Int J Oncol""","""['Methylation and mutation of the inhibin‑α gene in human melanoma cells and regulation of PTEN expression and AKT/PI3K signaling by a demethylating agent.', 'Promoter methylation of cyclin D2 gene in gastric carcinoma.', 'Inhibin-α gene mutations and mRNA levels in human lymphoid and myeloid leukemia cells.', 'Hypermethylation downregulates Runx3 gene expression and its restoration suppresses gastric epithelial cell growth by inducing p27 and caspase3 in human gastric cancer.', 'Correlation between the single-site CpG methylation and expression silencing of the XAF1 gene in human gastric and colon cancers.', 'DNA methylation and histone modifications are associated with repression of the inhibin α promoter in the rat corpus luteum.']"""

Materials and methods:   Forty-one patients with suspected prostate cancer underwent MR imaging (1.5 Tesla). A DWI sequence was added to the standard morphological protocol, with a maximum b value of 1,000 s/mm(2). Diffusion maps were obtained, and the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) was calculated by drawing a region of interest (ROI) over healthy tissue and areas suspicious for malignancy. Histology was considered the gold standard.  Results:   The areas correctly classified by MR imaging (42/51) had a low signal intensity on T2-weighted imaging and low ADC value (0.99 ± 0.15 mm(2)/s; p<0.01) compared with the healthy peripheral zone (PZ) (1.73 ± 0.27 mm(2)/s; p<0.01). Nine areas classified as suspicious for malignancy on T2-weighted sequences showed high ADC (1.44 ± 0.06 mm(2)/s; p<0.01) and were confirmed to be disease free by subsequent histological examination. The accuracy of morphofunctional MR imaging was 81.6% compared with 73.7% of the morphological analysis alone.

As high levels of Bcl-3 expression and activation have been detected in different types of human cancer, Bcl-3 has been labeled a proto-oncogene. Our study uncovered a markedly upregulated Bcl-3 expression in human prostate cancer (PCa), where inflammatory cell infiltration was observed. Elevated Bcl-3 expression in PCa was dependent on the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-6-mediated STAT3 activation. Microarray analyses, using Bcl-3 knockdown in PCa cells, identified the inhibitor of DNA-binding (Id) family of helix-loop-helix proteins as potential Bcl-3-regulated genes. Bcl-3 knockdown reduced the abundance of Id-1 and Id-2 proteins and boosted PCa cells to be more receptive to undergoing apoptosis following treatment with anticancer drug.

Methods and materials:   A phase I trial in 3 dose-escalation steps was designed: 14 Gy (3.5-Gy fractions), 16 Gy (4-Gy fractions), and 18 Gy (4.5-Gy fractions). The eligibility criteria included locally advanced and/or metastatic pelvic cancer and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of ≤ 3. Treatment was delivered in 2 days with twice-daily fractionation and at least an 8-hour interval. Patients were treated in cohorts of 6-12 to define the maximum tolerated dose. The dose-limiting toxicity was defined as any acute toxicity of grade 3 or greater, using the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group scale. Pain was recorded using a visual analog scale. The effect on quality of life was evaluated according to Cancer Linear Analog Scale (CLAS).  Results:   Of the 27 enrolled patients, 11 were male and 16 were female, with a median age of 72 years (range 47-86). The primary tumor sites were gynecologic (48%), colorectal (33.5%), and genitourinary (18.5%). The most frequent baseline symptoms were bleeding (48%) and pain (33%). Only grade 1-2 acute toxicities were recorded. No patients experienced dose-limiting toxicity. With a median follow-up time of 6 months (range 3-28), no late toxicities were observed. The overall (complete plus partial) symptom remission was 88.9% (95% confidence interval 66.0%-97.8%). Five patients (41.7%) had complete pain relief, and six (50%) showed >30% visual analog scale reduction. The overall response rate for pain was 91.67% (95% confidence interval 52.4%-99.9%).

One of the main products of these cells, sclerostin, inhibits bone formation and may also stimulate bone resorption. Circulating sclerostin has been evaluated in humans, but data are scarce in patients with different rates of bone turnover. To address this issue we evaluated serum sclerostin levels in patients with Paget's disease of bone (PD) and in patients with prostate cancer metastatic to the skeleton (PC). Sclerostin levels were measured in 88 patients with PD, 20 patients with PC and 237 healthy individuals (113 men and 124 women, aged 20 to 77 years). Bone turnover was evaluated by measuring serum levels of procollagen type 1 amino-terminal propeptide (P1NP) in all individuals studied and β-carboxy-terminal cross-linking telopeptide of type I collagen (β-CTX) only in patients. Patients were aged between 45 and 88 years and had a wide range of bone turnover: serum P1NP 9.2 to 1872 ng/ml and β-CTX 50 to 3120 pg/ml. Patients with PD and with PC had significantly higher mean serum sclerostin levels (53.1 ± 22.7 pg/ml and 56.6 ± 25.8 pg/ml, respectively) compared to healthy controls (38.1 ± 12.1 pg/ml) (p<0.001). Serum sclerostin levels were significantly correlated with P1NP in all (n=345) studied subjects (r=0.32, p<0.001). Circulating sclerostin levels are significantly increased in patients with increased bone turnover, regardless of underlying pathology. These increased levels may be due to a compensatory response to the increased number of osteoblasts at affected skeletal sites and may contribute to the increased bone resorption in patients with PC .""","""['Maria P Yavropoulou', 'Antoon H van Lierop', 'Neveen A T Hamdy', 'Rene Rizzoli', 'Socrates E Papapoulos']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Bone""","""['Patients with sclerosteosis and disease carriers: human models of the effect of sclerostin on bone turnover.', 'Distinct effects of pioglitazone and metformin on circulating sclerostin and biochemical markers of bone turnover in men with type 2 diabetes mellitus.', 'The amino-terminal propeptide (PINP) of type I collagen is a clinically valid indicator of bone turnover and extent of metastatic spread in osseous metastatic breast cancer.', ""Biochemical assessment of Paget's disease of bone."", 'Sclerostin: a possible target for the management of cancer-induced bone disease.', 'Metabolic Health and Disease: A Role of Osteokines?', 'The link between bone-derived factors osteocalcin, fibroblast growth factor 23, sclerostin, lipocalin 2 and tumor bone metastasis.', 'Bone Metastases and Health in Prostate Cancer: From Pathophysiology to Clinical Implications.', 'Serum Sclerostin and Its Association with Bone Turnover Marker in Metabolic Bone Diseases.', 'Sclerostin: From Molecule to Clinical Biomarker.']"""

This coordination is achieved by a network of autocrine and paracrine signalling molecules between cells of the osteoclastic lineage and cells of the osteoblastic lineage. Mathematical modelling of signalling between cells of both lineages can assist in the interpretation of experimental data, clarify signalling interactions and help develop a deeper understanding of complex bone diseases. Several mathematical models of bone cell interactions have been developed, some including RANK-RANKL-OPG signalling between cells and systemic parathyroid hormone PTH. However, to our knowledge these models do not currently include key aspects of some more recent biological evidence for anabolic responses. In this paper, we further develop a mathematical model of bone cell interactions by Pivonka et al. (2008) to include the proliferation of precursor osteoblasts into the model. This inclusion is important to be able to account for Wnt signalling, believed to play an important role in the anabolic responses of bone. We show that an increased rate of differentiation to precursor cells or an increased rate of proliferation of precursor osteoblasts themselves both result in increased bone mass. However, modelling these different processes separately enables the new model to represent recent experimental discoveries such as the role of Wnt signalling in bone biology and the recruitment of osteoblast progenitor cells by transforming growth factor β. Finally, we illustrate the power of the new model's capabilities by applying the model to prostate cancer metastasis to bone. In the bone microenvironment, prostate cancer cells are believed to release some of the same signalling molecules used to coordinate bone remodelling (i.e.,Wnt and PTHrP), enabling the cancer cells to disrupt normal signalling and coordination between bone cells. This disruption can lead to either bone gain or bone loss. We demonstrate that the new computational model developed here is capable of capturing some key observations made on the evolution of the bone mass due to metastasis of prostate cancer to the bone microenvironment.""","""['Pascal R Buenzli', 'Peter Pivonka', 'Bruce S Gardiner', 'David W Smith']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""J Theor Biol""","""['A theoretical model for simulating effect of parathyroid hormone on bone metabolism at cellular level.', 'Parathyroid hormone temporal effects on bone formation and resorption.', 'Studies on the mechanisms of the skeletal anabolic action of endogenous and exogenous parathyroid hormone.', 'Prostate cancer cells-osteoblast interaction shifts expression of growth/survival-related genes in prostate cancer and reduces expression of osteoprotegerin in osteoblasts.', 'The roles of parathyroid hormone in bone remodeling: prospects for novel therapeutics.', 'Spatio-temporal simulations of bone remodelling using a bone cell population model based on cell availability.', 'Trabecular bone remodeling in the aging mouse: A micro-multiphysics agent-based in silico model using single-cell mechanomics.', 'Mathematical modeling of the effects of Wnt-10b on bone metabolism.', 'Clinical Data for Parametrization of In Silico Bone Models Incorporating Cell-Cytokine Dynamics: A Systematic Review of Literature.', 'Integrated computational and in vivo models reveal Key Insights into macrophage behavior during bone healing.']"""

Design:   BMD and samples of blood and urine were studied before and after 6months of ADT in 70 patients with localized prostate cancer.  Results:   Before ADT, serum free-testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S), androstenedione, and IGF-I levels were correlated with BMD (rs=0.344, p=0.004; rs=0.264, p=0.027; rs=0.329, p=0.005; rs=0.300, p=0.012, respectively). The serum IGF-I level was independently correlated with the pretreatment BMD (Multivariate p=0.001). These relationships disappeared after ADT (p=0.519, 0.316, 0.116, and 0.597, respectively). After ADT, serum levels of free-testosterone decreased (7.9 to 0.2pg/mL), and DHEA-S and androstenedione were also reduced (3.6 to 2.3μmol/L and 5.6 to 2.9nmol/L, respectively) (p<0.001 in all). In contrast, IGF-I levels were elevated after ADT by 11.6% (19.9 to 22.3nmol/L, p<0.001). Delta-values of IGF-I (post- minus pretreatment levels, mean: +2.2, ranged between -7.1 and +15.3) were inversely correlated with the pretreatment (rs=-0.333 p=0.005) and post-treatment (rs=-0.408, p=0.001) BMD. After ADT, the serum IGF-I level was closely correlated with the serum level of the bone formation marker bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BAP) (rs=0.328, p=0.006), and delta-IGF-I and delta-BAP showed a close positive correlation (rs=0.388, p=0.001). The post-treatment BMD was correlated only with the urine deoxypyridinoline (DPD) concentration (rs=-0.302, p=0.024) among the bone formation/resorption markers including serum/urine N-telopeptide.  Conclusions:   Serum IGF-I levels increased during ADT in men with a low BMD. Coupled with reduced androgen levels, elevated IGF-I levels, which were positively correlated with BAP during ADT, possibly explain the mechanism of ADT-related high bone turnover. The increase of IGF-I is more prominent in men whose BMD is already low at the baseline, and urine DPD might be a marker that reflects BMD during ADT.""","""['Fumio Ishizaki', 'Noboru Hara', 'Itsuhiro Takizawa', 'Tsutomu Nishiyama', 'Etsuko Isahaya', 'Takashi Kawasaki', 'Kota Takahashi']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Growth Horm IGF Res""","""['Insulin-like growth factor-1 is associated with regulation of the luteinizing hormone production in men receiving androgen deprivation therapy with gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues for localized prostate cancer.', 'Bone metabolic disorder in patients with prostate cancer receiving androgen deprivation therapy (ADT): impact of ADT on the growth hormone/insulin-like growth factor-1/parathyroid hormone axis.', 'Decline of the red blood cell count in patients receiving androgen deprivation therapy for localized prostate cancer: impact of ADT on insulin-like growth factor-1 and erythropoiesis.', 'Androgens and prostate cancer; pathogenesis and deprivation therapy.', 'A Review on the Effects of Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT) on Bone Health Status in Men with Prostate Cancer.', 'Prostate carcinogenesis with diabetes and androgen-deprivation-therapy-related diabetes: an update.']"""

The exposure cohort (mean age = 47.9 years, standard deviation [SD] = 17.3 years) consisted of 59,647 patients with benzodiazepine use. Each patient from the exposure cohort was randomly frequency-matched by age and sex to a person from the cohort with no benzodiazepine exposure (the comparison group; mean age = 46.4 years, SD = 17.8 years). Each study subject was followed until a diagnosis of cancer was made (according to ICD-9-CM) or until the time the subject was censored for loss to follow-up, death, or termination of insurance-or to the end of 2009. A Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was conducted to estimate the effects of benzodiazepine use on cancer risk.  Results:   In the group with benzodiazepine use, the overall risk of developing cancer was 19% higher than in the group without benzodiazepine exposure, and the difference between the groups was statistically significant (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.19; 99.6% CI, 1.08-1.32).

Retrospective studies have suggested that such probes might have greater cancer detection rates.  Methods:   The present prospective randomized multicenter trial aimed to compare the prostate cancer detection rates of the end-fire versus side-fire probe configuration during transrectal ultrasound-guided 12-core prostate biopsy. Patients were randomized according to age, prostate-specific antigen level and prostate volume. An interim analysis was planned after the inclusion of 300 patients.  Results:   At the interim analysis after the inclusion of 297 patients, no differences were found in the mean prostate-specific antigen level (P = .412), mean age (P = .519), mean prostate volume (P = .730), and positive digital rectal examination findings (P = .295). The prostate cancer detection rate did not differ between the end-fire and side-fire probe (34.3% vs 34.4%, P = .972). On multivariate analysis, suspicious digital rectal examination findings (relative risk 8.185, P < .001), prostate-specific antigen level (relative risk 1.051, P = .041), and prostate volume (relative risk 0.973, P < .001), but not probe configuration (relative risk 0.942, P = .831), were independent predictive factors for the detection of prostate cancer. The interim analysis committee suggested that, because no difference of 5 absolute percent was achieved after 300 patients, no additional recruitment was necessary. Therefore, the study was terminated early.  Conclusion:   The results of the present study have shown that the transrectal ultrasound probe configuration does not affect the prostate cancer detection rate during transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy.""","""['Maximilian Rom', 'Armin Pycha', 'Christian Wiunig', 'Andreas Reissigl', 'Matthias Waldert', 'Tobias Klatte', 'Mesut Remzi', 'Christian Seitz']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Urology""","""['Editorial comment.', 'Does transrectal ultrasound probe configuration really matter?

We assessed the relationship between treatment type (radical prostatectomy vs observation) and cancer specific mortality in a large, population based cohort.  Materials and methods:   We examined the records of 44,694 patients treated with radical prostatectomy or observation between 1992 and 2005 in the SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results)-Medicare linked database. Patients were matched by propensity score. Competing risks analysis was done to test the effect of treatment type on cancer specific mortality after accounting for other cause mortality. The number needed to treat was calculated. All analysis was stratified by prostate cancer risk group, baseline Charlson comorbidity index and patient age.  Results:   For patients treated with radical prostatectomy vs observation the 10-year cancer specific mortality rate was 5.2% vs 12.8% for high risk prostate cancer, 1.4% vs 3.8% for low-intermediate risk prostate cancer, 2.4% vs 5.8% for a Charlson comorbidity index of 0, 2.3% vs 6.4% for a comorbidity index of 1, 2.5% vs 5.4% for a comorbidity index of 2 or greater, 2.0% vs 4.6% at ages 65 to 69, 2.6% vs 5.6% at ages 70 to 74 and 2.7% vs 8.1% at ages 75 to 80 years (each p <0.001). The corresponding number need to treat was 13, 42, 29, 24, 34, 38, 33 and 19, respectively.

Current guidelines state that a close surgical margin should simply be reported as negative. However, this recommendation remains controversial and relies on limited evidence. We evaluated the impact of close surgical margins on the long-term risk of biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy.  Materials and methods:   We identified 1,195 consecutive patients who underwent radical prostatectomy and lymphadenectomy for localized prostate cancer at our institution from 1993 to 1999. In 894 of these patients associations between margin status and location, Gleason score, pathological stage, preoperative prostate specific antigen, prostate weight and age with the risk of biochemical recurrence were examined.  Results:   Of these 894 patients 644 (72%) had negative margins and of these patients 100 (15.5%) had close surgical margins. In the group with prostate specific antigen failure, median time to recurrence was 3.5 years. In the group without recurrence median followup was 9.9 years. Cumulative recurrence-free survival differed significantly among positive, negative and close surgical margins (p <0.001). On multivariate analysis a close surgical margin constituted a significant, independent predictor of recurrence (HR 2.1, 95% CI 1.04-4.33). Gleason score and positive margins were the strongest prognostic factors.  Conclusions:   In this cohort close surgical margins were independently associated with a twofold risk of postoperative biochemical recurrence. Further evaluation of the clinical significance of close surgical margins is indicated as they might be an indicator of local recurrence and of relevance when considering salvage therapy.""","""['Jian Lu', 'Gregory J Wirth', 'Shulin Wu', 'Junxing Chen', 'Douglas M Dahl', 'Aria F Olumi', 'Robert H Young', 'W Scott McDougal', 'Chin-Lee Wu']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Impact of positive surgical margins on prostate-specific antigen failure after radical prostatectomy in adjuvant treatment-naïve patients.', 'Length of positive surgical margin after radical prostatectomy as a predictor of biochemical recurrence.', 'High Gleason grade carcinoma at a positive surgical margin predicts biochemical failure after radical prostatectomy and may guide adjuvant radiotherapy.', 'The importance of surgical margins in prostate cancer.', 'Radical prostatectomy: positive surgical margins matter.', 'Predictive Factors for Positive Surgical Margins in Patients With Prostate Cancer After Radical Prostatectomy: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'Factors affecting biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy in patients with positive and negative surgical margin.', 'Positive surgical margin is associated with biochemical recurrence risk following radical prostatectomy: a meta-analysis from high-quality retrospective cohort studies.', 'Safety and efficacy of salvage low-dose-rate brachytherapy for prostate bed recurrences following radical prostatectomy.', 'Determinants and effects of positive surgical margins after prostatectomy on prostate cancer mortality: a population-based study.']"""

Predictors of cancer related death in this patient group are necessary.  Materials and methods:   We performed subset analysis of a prospective trial including 550 consecutive patients with preoperative high risk prostate cancer (prostate specific antigen greater than 20 ng/ml ± cT3/4 ± biopsy Gleason 8-10). Men who underwent radical prostatectomy and received continuous adjuvant androgen deprivation therapy for pT3a/b N0-1 positive surgical margin disease were included in the analysis, and none of the patients received neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy or adjuvant radiation therapy.  Results:   Overall 173 of 550 patients (31.5%) with a median followup of 67 months met the study inclusion criteria. For these men the estimated 8-year prostate cancer specific and overall survival rates were 86.3% and 77.0%, respectively. Tumor stage and positive surgical margin at the bladder neck were independent predictors of prostate cancer specific survival and overall survival, and were used to substratify cases. Those with pT3b disease with positive surgical margins at the bladder neck had the highest risk of death (5-year cancer specific survival 60.0% and overall survival 52.3%), while pT3a disease (regardless of positive surgical margin location and lymph node invasion) and pT3b tumors with negative bladder neck margins had 8-year prostate cancer specific survival and overall survival rates of 92.0% and 84.9%, respectively.  Conclusions:   The results of this trial demonstrated the heterogeneity of high risk prostate cancer cases with T3 tumors and positive surgical margins.

If patients can be selected properly, focal therapy could enable tumor eradication without the morbidity associated with salvage radical prostatectomy. We describe the pathological features of recurrent prostate cancer in salvage radical prostatectomy specimens and the implications of these results for focal therapy.  Materials and methods:   We gathered data on 50 consecutive patients who had recurrence after primary radiation therapy and underwent salvage radical prostatectomy between 1993 and 2008. Preoperatively prostate specific antigen was less than 10 ng/ml in 49 patients (98%) and biopsy Gleason score was 7 or less in 18 (36%). Salvage radical prostatectomy specimens were analyzed for tumor zonal origin, site and volume, Gleason score and pathological stage.  Results:   Median preoperative prostate specific antigen was 3.4 ng/ml. Pathological stage was T2 in 23 patients (46%). The salvage radical prostatectomy Gleason score was 7 or less in 17 patients (34%) and surgical margins were negative in 43 (86%). A single cancer focus was found in 33 cases (66%) while there was bilateral involvement in 37 (74%). The base and apex were involved in 23 cases (46%) and 37 tumors (74%) were located within 5.0 mm of the urethra. Median tumor volume was 1.27 cm(3) (range 0.05 to 12.96).  Conclusions:   Prostate cancer recurrence after radiation therapy is often bilateral and involves multiple zones. It is often high grade, bulky and close to the urethra.

This implies that the CR concentration [CR] is high in the extracellular, extravascular space (EES) during a large portion of the DCE-MRI study. Since CR is detected indirectly, through water proton signal change, the effects of equilibrium transcytolemmal water exchange may be significant in the data and thus should be admitted in DCE-MRI pharmacokinetic modeling. The implications for parameter values were investigated through simulations, and analyses of actual prostate data, with different models. Model parameter correlation and precision were also explored. A near-optimal version of the exchange-sensitized model was found. Our results indicate that ΔK(trans) (the K(trans) difference returned by this version and a model assuming exchange to be effectively infinitely fast) may be a very useful biomarker for discriminating malignant from benign prostate tissue.

Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) has been associated with increased risk of cardiovascular and overall mortality. Therefore, the objective of our study was to evaluate the impact of baseline renal function on oncologic outcomes and overall survival following radical prostatectomy.  Materials and methods:   We identified 10,099 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy at our institution from 1990 to 2004 with a preoperative serum creatinine available for analysis. eGFR was calculated by the chronic kidney disease-epidemiology formula (CKD-EPI) and reported as ml/min per 1.73 m(2). Patients were then classified according to their eGFR: <30, 30-59, 60-89, 90-119, and 120-150 ml/min/1.73 m(2). Multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to analyze the impact of eGFR on postoperative outcomes.  Results:   At the time of surgery, 25 patients (0.1%) had an eGFR <30 ml/min/1.73 m(2), 2,398 (23.7%) between 30 and 60, 7,097 (70.3%) between 60 and 90, and 605 (6.0%) patients had an eGFR >90. eGFR was not associated with oncologic outcomes, including biochemical recurrence, systemic progression or cancer-specific survival (P > 0.05 for all). However, eGFR was strongly associated with all-cause mortality and non-prostate cancer death. On multivariate analysis, after controlling for age, BMI, prostate-specific antigen doubling time (PSA), Gleason score, and clinical stage, eGFR remains a statistically significant predictor of all-cause mortality.  Conclusions:   Assessment of eGFR is an important metric in the overall evaluation of patient health and should be considered in combination with patient age and other medical comorbidities when selecting the initial treatment of prostate cancer. While prostate cancer-specific outcomes do not appear to be impacted by renal function, overall survival is decreased in those with lower and higher than normal eGFR.""","""['Matthew K Tollefson', 'Stephen A Boorjian', 'Matthew T Gettman', 'Laureano J Rangel', 'Eric J Bergstralh', 'R Jeffrey Karnes']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Long-term oncological outcomes of men undergoing radical prostatectomy with preoperative prostate-specific antigen <2.5 ng/ml and 2.5-4 ng/ml.', 'PSA doubling time as a predictor of clinical progression after biochemical failure following radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer.', 'Impact of positive surgical margins on prostate-specific antigen failure after radical prostatectomy in adjuvant treatment-naïve patients.', 'Long-term oncological outcomes after laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.', 'Is there always a role for radical prostatectomy in the treatment of localized prostate cancer?', 'Post-surgical outcomes of patients with chronic kidney disease and end stage renal disease undergoing radical prostatectomy: 10-year results from the US National Inpatient Sample.', 'Chronic kidney disease and positive surgical margins as prognosticators for upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma patients undergoing radical nephroureterectomy.', 'Is preoperative chronic kidney disease status associated with oncologic outcomes in upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma?

Materials and methods:   Three-dimensional proton MRSI was applied at 1.5 T. MRSI data from 10 patients with histologically proven prostate adenocarcinoma, scheduled either for prostatectomy or intensity-modulated radiation therapy, were evaluated. First, two readers manually labeled spectra using spatial information to identify the localization of spectra and neighborhood information, establishing the reference set of this study. Then, spectra were labeled again manually in a blinded and randomized manner and evaluated automatically using software that applied spectral line fitting as well as pattern recognition routines. Statistical analysis of the results of the different approaches was performed.  Results:   Altogether, 1018 spectra were evaluable by all methods. Numbers of evaluable spectra differed significantly depending on patient and evaluation method. Compared to automated analysis, the readers made rather binary decisions, using information from neighboring spectra in ambiguous cases, when evaluating MRSI data as a whole. Differences between anatomically blinded and unblinded evaluation were larger than differences between evaluations using blinded data and automated techniques.  Conclusions:   An automated approach, which evaluates each spectrum individually, can be as good as an anatomy-blinded human reader.

The common clinical practice for advanced prostatic adenocarcinoma is combination therapy of zoledronic acid (ZA) and docetaxel (TAX). Little is known about the consequences of this combination therapy with regard to osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ). This study shows that the combination therapy of ZA and TAX increases the risk of ONJ and that tooth extraction and leukopenia induced by TAX are the risk factors.  Objective:   • To determine whether docetaxel (TAX) can increase the risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) in patients with prostatic adenocarcinoma (PC) receiving zoledronic acid (ZA), a bisphosphonate (BP) used in the treatment of patients with cancer.  Materials and methods:   • The medical records of 111 patients with PC who received ZA between September 2006 and March 2011 at our institutions were reviewed to assess the incidence and risk factors for ONJ.  Results:   • Nine patients (8.1%) developed ONJ during a median follow-up of 14.5 months. • Using univariate analysis we found that TAX chemotherapy (P=0.037, hazard ratio [HR] 6.611), tooth extraction during ZA therapy (P<0.001, HR 11.254), and high prostate-specific antigen level (P=0.019, HR 8.008) at the start of ZA were predictive factors. • Using multivariate analysis we found that TAX chemotherapy (P=0.011, HR 56.35), steroid use (P=0.044, HR = 17.795), and tooth extraction (P=0.039, HR 7.471) were independent predictors. • Among those receiving TAX chemotherapy, multivariate analysis identified tooth extraction (P=0.009) and nadir WBC counts <1000/µL during TAX chemotherapy (P=0.030) as independent risk factors.  Conclusion:   • Tooth extraction and nadir WBC counts <1000/µL were found to be risk factors for ONJ in metastatic prostate cancer treated with ZA and TAX combination therapy, showing that leukopenia is an important factor in the development of ONJ.""","""['Hideyo Miyazaki', 'Hiroaki Nishimatsu', 'Haruki Kume', 'Motofumi Suzuki', 'Tetsuya Fujimura', 'Hiroshi Fukuhara', 'Yutaka Enomoto', 'Akira Ishikawa', 'Yasuhiko Igawa', 'Yoshikazu Hirano', 'Yukio Homma']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Osteonecrosis of the jaw in cancer after treatment with bisphosphonates: incidence and risk factors.', 'Prevalence and risk factors of bisphosphonate-associated osteonecrosis of the jaw in prostate cancer patients with advanced disease treated with zoledronate.', 'Clinical study evaluating the effect of bevacizumab on the severity of zoledronic acid-related osteonecrosis of the jaw in cancer patients.', 'Osteonecrosis of jaw in patient with hormone-refractory prostate cancer treated with zoledronic acid.', 'Osteonecrosis of the Jaw in Patients Receiving Bone-Targeted Therapies: An Overview--Part I.', 'Prevalence of Medication-Related Osteonecrosis of the Jaw in Patients with Breast Cancer, Prostate Cancer, and Multiple Myeloma.', 'Osteonecrosis of the Jaw Developed in Mice: DISEASE VARIANTS REGULATED BY γδ T CELLS IN ORAL MUCOSAL BARRIER IMMUNITY.', 'Diabetes as a risk factor for medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw.', 'Legal liability in bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw.', 'Risk factors and indices of osteomyelitis of the jaw in osteoporosis patients: results from a hospital-based cohort study in Japan.']"""

To further improve molecular classification of inflammatory bowel disease phenotypes we focused on a single anatomic site, the disease unaffected proximal ileal margin of resected ileum, and three phenotypes that were unlikely to overlap: ileal Crohn's disease (ileal CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), and control patients without IBD. Whole human genome (Agilent) expression profiling was conducted on two independent sets of disease-unaffected ileal samples collected from the proximal margin of resected ileum. Set 1 (47 ileal CD, 27 UC, and 25 Control non-IBD patients) was used as the training set and Set 2 was subsequently collected as an independent test set (10 ileal CD, 10 UC, and 10 control non-IBD patients). We compared the 17 gene signatures selected by four different feature-selection methods to distinguish ileal CD phenotype with non-CD phenotype. The four methods yielded different but overlapping solutions that were highly discriminating. All four of these methods selected FOLH1 as a common feature. This gene is an established biomarker for prostate cancer, but has not previously been associated with Crohn's disease. Immunohistochemical staining confirmed increased expression of FOLH1 in the ileal epithelium.

The androgen dependent prostate cancer cell line, LNCaP, expresses the ErbB-1, ErbB-2 and ErbB-3 receptor tyrosine kinases. Previously, it was demonstrated that NRG activates ErbB-2/ErbB-3 heterodimers to induce LNCaP cell death, whereas, EGF activates ErbB-1/ErbB-1 or ErbB-1/ErbB-2 dimers to induce cell growth and survival. It was also demonstrated that PI3K inhibitors repressed this cell death suggesting that in androgen deprived LNCaP cells, NRG activates a PI3K-dependent pathway associated with cell death.  Methodology/principal findings:   In the present study we demonstrate that NRG induces autophagy in LNCaP cells, using LC3 as a marker. However, the autophagy induced by NRG may be incomplete since p62 levels elevate. We also demonstrated that NRG- induced autophagy is independent of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibition since NRG induces Akt and S6K activation. Interestingly, inhibition of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by N-acetylcysteine (NAC), inhibited NRG-induced autophagy and cell death. Our study also identified JNK and Beclin 1 as important components in NRG-induced autophagy and cell death. NRG induced elevation in JNK phosphorylation that was inhibited by NAC. Moreover, inhibitor of JNK inhibited NRG-induced autophagy and cell death. Also, in cells overexpressing Bcl-2 or cells expressing sh-RNA against Beclin 1, the effects of NRG, namely induction of autophagy and cell death, were inhibited.  Conclusions/significance:   Thus, in LNCaP cells, NRG-induces incomplete autophagy and cell death that depend on ROS levels. These effects of NRG are mediated by signaling pathway that activates JNK and Beclin 1, but is independent of mTOR inhibition.""","""['Eran Schmukler', 'Ben Shai', 'Marcelo Ehrlich', 'Ronit Pinkas-Kramarski']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Neuregulin promotes autophagic cell death of prostate cancer cells.', 'ROS Promote Ox-LDL-Induced Platelet Activation by Up-Regulating Autophagy Through the Inhibition of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR Pathway.', 'Puquitinib mesylate (XC-302) induces autophagy via inhibiting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway in nasopharyngeal cancer cells.', ""Can the interplay between autophagy and apoptosis be targeted as a novel therapy for Parkinson's disease?"", 'Autophagy and cardiovascular aging: lesson learned from rapamycin.', 'Autophagy is induced and modulated by cholesterol depletion through transcription of autophagy-related genes and attenuation of flux.', 'HER3 Differentiates Basal From Claudin Type Triple Negative Breast Cancer and Contributes to Drug and Microenvironmental Induced Resistance.', 'The Interplay Between Apolipoprotein E4 and the Autophagic-Endocytic-Lysosomal Axis.', 'Interplay of autophagy, receptor tyrosine kinase signalling and endocytic trafficking.', 'microRNA-32 induces radioresistance by targeting DAB2IP and regulating autophagy in prostate cancer cells.']"""

The impact of changes in primary treatment and adjuvant and neoadjuvant hormone therapy on this decline is unknown.  Methods:   The authors applied 3 independently developed models of prostate cancer natural history and disease detection under common assumptions about treatment patterns, treatment efficacy, and survival in the population. Primary treatment patterns were derived from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registry; data on the frequency of hormone therapy were obtained from the CaPSURE (Cancer of the Prostate Strategic Urologic Research Endeavor) database; and treatment efficacy was based on estimates from randomized trials and comparative effectiveness studies of treatment alternatives. The models projected prostate cancer mortality without prostate-specific antigen screening and in the presence and absence of treatment benefit. The impact of primary treatment was expressed as a fraction of the difference between observed mortality and projected mortality in the absence of treatment benefit.  Results:   The 3 models projected that changes in treatment explained 22% to 33% of the mortality decline by 2005. These contributions were accounted for mostly by surgery and radiation therapy, which increased in frequency until the 1990s, whereas hormone therapies contributed little to the mortality decline by 2005. Assuming that treatment benefit was less for older men, changes in treatment explained only 16% to 23% of the mortality decline by 2005.

The method was tested on 30 randomly selected image frames from three cases, comparing the results from the automatic algorithm to a manual delineation of 924 nuclei. The automatic method segmented a few more nuclei compared to the manual method, and about 73% of the manually segmented nuclei were also segmented by the automatic method. For each nucleus segmented both manually and automatically, the accuracy (i.e., agreement with manual delineation) was estimated. The mean segmentation sensitivity/specificity were 95%/96%.

Most of the detailed understanding that we have of AR transcriptional activation has been gained by studying classical target genes. For more than two decades, Kallikrein 3 (KLK3) (prostate-specific antigen) has been used as a prototypical AR target gene, because it is highly androgen responsive in prostate cancer cells. Three regions upstream of the KLK3 gene, including the distal enhancer, are known to contain consensus androgen-responsive elements required for AR-mediated transcriptional activation. Here, we show that KLK3 is one of a specific cluster of androgen-regulated genes at the centromeric end of the kallikrein locus with enhancers that evolved from the long terminal repeat (LTR) (LTR40a) of an endogenous retrovirus. Ligand-dependent recruitment of the AR to individual LTR-derived enhancers results in concurrent up-regulation of endogenous KLK2, KLK3, and KLKP1 expression in LNCaP prostate cancer cells. At the molecular level, a kallikrein-specific duplication within the LTR is required for maximal androgen responsiveness. Therefore, KLK3 represents a subset of target genes regulated by repetitive elements but is not typical of the whole spectrum of androgen-responsive transcripts.

Second, the longitudinal response of chemically induced rat mammary adenocarcinomas to the VEGFR2 inhibitor vandetanib was monitored by intrinsic susceptibility MRI, to identify the time window of transient vascular normalisation.  Results:   No significant differences in fractional blood volume (%), vessel calibre (μm), native T(1) (ms) or apparent water diffusion coefficient were determined, despite reduced expression of activated Fak and paxillin in the saracatinib cohort.

In tissue culture, compared with HSV1716, HSV1716Ing4 produced significantly higher numbers of infectious progeny in human squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), breast, ovarian, prostate and colorectal cancer cell lines.

Methods:   Two sets of experiments were performed, IPDT only and IPDT in the presence of antioxidant.

Treatment outcome was monitored twice a week by an imaging system and by measuring tumour dimensions using a caliper. Photosensitivity was assessed by monitoring erythema of the tail using the imaging system.  Results:   IPDT with Fospeg and 15 J total light energy is a therapeutic scheme that can eliminate tumours in the murine model of prostate cancer. Two months after complete tumour remission no tumour recurrence was observed. Also, the cosmetic outcome of the research was excellent. The major drawback of this treatment scheme was that 90% of the animals developed photosensitivity.

It was also noteworthy that apoptosis correlated with reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, mitochondrial damage, oxidative stress and chromatin condensation in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Results also showed involvement of caspases, Bcl-2 family proteins, heat shock protein 70, and a cell-cycle checkpoint protein p53 in apoptosis induction by bsCdS QDs in LNCaP cells. Moreover, pro-apoptotic protein Bax was upregulated and the anti-apoptotic proteins, survivin and NF-κB were downregulated in bsCdS QDs exposed cells. Protection of N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) against ROS clearly suggested the implication of ROS in hyper-activation of apoptosis and cell death. It is encouraging to conclude that biologically stabilized CdS QDs bear the potential of its applications in biomedicine, such as tumor therapy specifically by inducing caspase-dependent apoptotic cell death of human prostate cancer LNCaP cells.""","""['Braj R Singh', 'Brahma N Singh', 'W Khan', 'H B Singh', 'A H Naqvi']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Biomaterials""","""['CdSe/ZnS quantum dots induce photodynamic effects and cytotoxicity in pancreatic cancer cells.', 'Apigenin drives the production of reactive oxygen species and initiates a mitochondrial mediated cell death pathway in prostate epithelial cells.', 'Guggulsterone-induced apoptosis in human prostate cancer cells is caused by reactive oxygen intermediate dependent activation of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase.', 'Research advances on apoptosis caused by quantum dots.', 'Oxidative stress and apoptosis: impact on cancer therapy.', 'Ameliorative role of nanocurcumin against the toxicological effects of novel forms of Cuo as nanopesticides: a comparative study.', 'Study on the genetic damage caused by cadmium sulfide quantum dots in human lymphocytes.', 'Polycaprolactone/gelatin electrospun nanofibres containing biologically produced tellurium nanoparticles as a potential wound dressing scaffold: Physicochemical, mechanical, and biological characterisation.', 'Activity of CdTe Quantum-Dot-Tagged Superoxide Dismutase and Its Analysis in Capillary Electrophoresis.', 'Reactive Oxygen Species-Related Nanoparticle Toxicity in the Biomedical Field.']"""

Some of these compounds antagonize transient receptor potential melastatin type-8 (TRPM8) channels, the expression of which is necessary for androgen receptor (AR)-dependent PCC survival.  Experimental approach:   We tested pure cannabinoids and extracts from Cannabis strains enriched in particular cannabinoids (BDS), on AR-positive (LNCaP and 22RV1) and -negative (DU-145 and PC-3) cells, by evaluating cell viability (MTT test), cell cycle arrest and apoptosis induction, by FACS scans, caspase 3/7 assays, DNA fragmentation and TUNEL, and size of xenograft tumours induced by LNCaP and DU-145 cells.  Key results:   Cannabidiol (CBD) significantly inhibited cell viability. Other compounds became effective in cells deprived of serum for 24 h. Several BDS were more potent than the pure compounds in the presence of serum. CBD-BDS (i.p.) potentiated the effects of bicalutamide and docetaxel against LNCaP and DU-145 xenograft tumours and, given alone, reduced LNCaP xenograft size. CBD (1-10 µM) induced apoptosis and induced markers of intrinsic apoptotic pathways (PUMA and CHOP expression and intracellular Ca(2+)). In LNCaP cells, the pro-apoptotic effect of CBD was only partly due to TRPM8 antagonism and was accompanied by down-regulation of AR, p53 activation and elevation of reactive oxygen species. LNCaP cells differentiated to androgen-insensitive neuroendocrine-like cells were more sensitive to CBD-induced apoptosis.

Fibroblasts represent the major cell type of the stromal compartment. Aiming at clarifying the relationships between normal fibroblasts and epithelial cancer cells, we utilized a co-culture system, which included both androgen-sensitive (LNCaP) and -insensitive (PC-3, DU-145) prostate cancer cell lines and a human gingival fibroblast cell line (FG).  Materials and methods:   The morphological aspects of the cultures were analyzed under an inverted phase-contrast microscope; the proliferation in conditioned media (CM) was assessed by cell counts, and the E-cadherin expression was evaluated by immunocytochemistry.  Results:   In co-culture, androgen-sensitive LNCaP cells grew in a network on the top of the monolayer formed by FG, while colonies of androgen-insensitive PC-3 and DU-145 cells were surrounded by FG cells. After six days, the LNCaP cell number was apparently lower in the co-cultures than in the plates where they grew alone. Both LNCaP and FG cells underwent morphological changes. After the same period of time, the growth of PC-3 and DU-145 cells overcame the growth of FG cells, which were almost abolished. The CM of FG inhibited the proliferation of LNCaP cells, after three days by 33% (p<0.01) and after six days by up to 82% (p<0.01), but had no effect on the PC-3 and DU-145 cell growth. The CM of all three prostate cancer cell lines reduced the growth of FG. Growth reduction in DU-145 cells was the most effective (50% inhibition after three days, p<0.01, and 55% after six days, p<0.01). FG did not express E-cadherin, while strong E-cadherin staining was detected in LNCaP cells. PC-3 cells exhibited E-cadherin nuclear staining, while sporadic membrane expression of the specific protein was observed in DU-145 cells. In co-culture, there seemed to be a reduction in the nuclear E-cadherin reactivity of PC-3 cells.  Conclusion:   Our data confirm the existence of a dialogue between normal fibroblasts and prostate cancer cells, which results in both a peculiar modality of growth and a regulation of proliferation, probably due to factors secreted in the culture medium.

In the current study, we asked whether an extracellular matrix (ECM), produced by human foreskin fibroblasts in culture, could inhibit PC-3 human prostate cancer CTC metastasis in the chick embryo model. The chorioallantoic membranes (CAM) of 18 chicken embryos were inoculated with either PC-3 human prostate cancer cells or PC-3 CTCs, both stably expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP). Embryos were divided into six groups: PC-3 parental-cell control; PC-3 plus soluble ECM; PC-3 parental cells plus semi-solid ECM; PC-3 CTC control; PC-3 CTC plus soluble ECM, and PC-3 CTC plus semi-solid ECM. Twelve hours following inoculation of the cells, a single dose of 100 μl of either soluble or semi-solid ECM was added to the appropriate group. Embryo brains were removed on day 8 post-inoculation, and were processed for cryosectioning. Imaging was performed on the cryosections using a scanning laser microscope in order to count metastatic foci.

However, recent study results suggest that many such genes relate to a small number of biological functions. We hypothesized that analysis of these functions provides a better understanding of tumor biology than does actual identification of these genes.  Materials and methods:   We re-analyzed publicly available gene expression data for paired samples of prostate tumor and adjacent normal tissue from the same patients to identify genes differently expressed in individual tumors and then used them to identify the functions.  Results:   We found significant interindividual variation in the type and the number of functions. After adjusting for redundancy and nonspecificity of the functional terms, we identified seven functions. Several of them showed a strong association with clinical traits, e.g. age at diagnosis, preoperative prostate-specific antigen concentration, Gleason grade, and biochemical recurrence. Actin cytoskeleton was the function most frequently associated with clinical traits.

We show here that stromal-derived androgenic precursors are metabolized by DU145 human prostate cancer (PCa) cells to generate ligands for estrogen receptor-β, which act to limit their motility through transcriptional regulation of E-cadherin. Although primary human PCa-associated fibroblasts and the human WPMY-1-reactive prostate stromal cell line maintain this inherent estrogen receptor (ER)β-dependent motility inhibitor activity, they are subverted by TGF-β1 pro-oxidant signals derived from cocultured DU145 PCa cells. Specifically, stromal-produced H(2)O(2), which requires Cox-2, acts as a second paracrine factor to inhibit ERβ activity in adjacent DU145 cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis reveals that ERβ recruitment to the E-cadherin promoter is inhibited when H(2)O(2) is present. Both neutralization of H(2)O(2) with catalase and prevention of its production by silencing Cox-2 expression in stromal cells restore the motility-suppression activity of stromal-derived ERβ ligand precursors. These data suggest that reactive stromal cells may still have a capacity to limit cancer cell motility through a local endocrine network but must be protected from pro-oxidant signals triggered by cancer cell-derived TGF-β1 to exhibit this cancer-suppressive function.""","""['Melanie J Grubisha', 'M E Cifuentes', 'Stephen R Hammes', 'Donald B Defranco']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Mol Endocrinol""","""['Inhibition of Nox4-dependent ROS signaling attenuates prostate fibroblast activation and abrogates stromal-mediated protumorigenic interactions.', 'Expression of two WFDC1/ps20 isoforms in prostate stromal cells induces paracrine apoptosis through regulation of PTGS2/COX-2.', 'Estrogens promote invasion of prostate cancer cells in a paracrine manner through up-regulation of matrix metalloproteinase 2 in prostatic stromal cells.', 'Local endocrine, paracrine and redox signaling networks impact estrogen and androgen crosstalk in the prostate cancer microenvironment.', 'Signaling pathways regulating aromatase and cyclooxygenases in normal and malignant breast cells.', 'Cancer-Associated Fibroblast Heterogeneity, Activation and Function: Implications for Prostate Cancer.', 'Estrogen receptor-β signaling induces cisplatin resistance in bladder cancer.', 'Heart failure as interstitial cancer: emergence of a malignant fibroblast phenotype.', 'Comprehensive assessment of estrogen receptor beta antibodies in cancer cell line models and tissue reveals critical limitations in reagent specificity.', 'MicroRNA-382-5p aggravates breast cancer progression by regulating the RERG/Ras/ERK signaling axis.']"""

While tumour cells migrate through tissues using diverse strategies, the signalling networks controlling such behaviours in human tumours are poorly understood. Here we define a role for the Diaphanous-related formin-3 (DIAPH3) as a non-canonical regulator of metastasis that restrains conversion to amoeboid cell behaviour in multiple cancer types. The DIAPH3 locus is close to RB1, within a narrow consensus region of deletion on chromosome 13q in prostate, breast and hepatocellular carcinomas. DIAPH3 silencing in human carcinoma cells destabilized microtubules and induced defective endocytic trafficking, endosomal accumulation of EGFR, and hyperactivation of EGFR/MEK/ERK signalling. Silencing also evoked amoeboid properties, increased invasion and promoted metastasis in mice. In human tumours, DIAPH3 down-regulation was associated with aggressive or metastatic disease. DIAPH3-silenced cells were sensitive to MEK inhibition, but showed reduced sensitivity to EGFR inhibition.

Prostate cancer can be initiated in both benign basal and luminal stem cells, but because basal cell markers are not expressed in patient tumors, the former result was unexpected. Since the cells of origin of prostate cancer are important therapeutic targets, we sought to provide further proof that basal stem cells have tumorigenic potential. Prostatic basal cells were enriched based on α2β1integrin(hi) expression and further enriched for stem cells using CD133 in nontumorigenic BPH-1 cells. Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) were also used as a source of normal stem cells. To test their tumorigenicity, we used two alternate stromal-based approaches; (a) recombination with human cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) or (b) recombination with embryonic stroma (urogenital mesenchyme) and treated host mice with testosterone and 17β-estradiol. Enriched α2β1integrin(hi) basal cells from BPH-1 cells resulted in malignant tumor formation using both assays of tumorigenicity. Surprisingly, the tumorigenic potential did not reside in the CD133(+) stem cells but was consistently observed in the CD133(-) population. CAFs also failed to induce prostatic tumors from hESCs. These data confirmed that benign human basal cells include cells of origin of prostate cancer and reinforced their importance as therapeutic targets. In addition, our data suggested that the more proliferative CD133(-) basal cells are more susceptible to tumorigenesis compared to the CD133(+)-enriched stem cells.

However, its usefulness has not been fully validated in Japanese patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic utility of AMACR in prostate needle biopsy examination in Japanese patients.  Methods:   A total of 119 prospective consecutive prostate needle biopsy specimens (680 cores) obtained from Japanese patients were examined. Sixty patients had adenocarcinoma (adenocarcinoma, 160 cores; benign, 204 cores), 14 patients had high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN; 19 cores), and 45 patients did not have any neoplastic lesions (297 cores). AMACR expression was scored semi-quantitatively as 0 (no expression), 1+ (partial and/or weak expression), or 2+ (strong, circumferential expression). The number of positively stained glands was counted.  Results:   2+ AMACR expression was observed in 70.1% of adenocarcinoma cases and in 52.6% of HGPIN cases. Of the adenocarcinoma cases showing 2+ AMACR expression, 34.8% demonstrated a heterogeneous expression pattern, with 1-75% of AMACR-positive glands. Three hundred eighty-five of the benign glands with an adenocarcinoma component showed 2+ AMACR expression (35 cases, 94 cores). 2+ AMACR expression was observed in 67 non-neoplastic benign glands (9 cases, 19 cores).

Natural products are the most consistent source of small molecules for drug development. In this study, we investigate the functional impact of piperlongumine (PL), a naturally occurring alkaloid present in the Long pepper (Piper longum), on AR expression in PC cells and delineate its mechanism of action.  Methods:   Expression and transcriptional activity of AR was examined by western blotting and luciferase reporter assay, respectively. CellTiter Blue assay was utilized to quantify cell proliferation. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation was examined by staining cells with a ROS indicator CM-H(2) DCFDA, followed by flow cytometry analysis.  Results:   The results of our experiments demonstrate that PL rapidly reduces AR protein levels in PC cells via proteasome-mediated ROS-dependent mechanism. Moreover, PL effectively depletes a modified AR lacking the ligand-binding domain, shedding light on a new paradigm in the treatment approach to prostatic carcinoma that expresses mutated constitutively active AR. Importantly, PL effectively depletes AR in PC cells at low micromolar concentrations, while concurrently exerting a significant inhibitory effect on AR transcriptional activity and proliferation of PC cells.  Conclusions:   Our investigation demonstrates for the first time that PL induces rapid depletion of the AR in PC cells.

A novel real-time impedance-based growth monitoring system was compared with widely used end-point MTT assay. Impedance-based IC(50) for zinc(ii) is 55.5 and 150.8 μM for PC-3 and PNT1A, respectively. MTT-determined IC(50) are >1.3-fold higher. Impedance-based viability correlates with viable count (r > 0.92; p < 0.03), not with MTT. Two-fold lower intracellular zinc(ii) in the tumour PC-3 cell line was found. After zinc(ii) treatment >2.6-fold increase of intracellular zinc(ii) was observed in non-tumour PNT1A and in tumour PC-3 cells. In PC-3 cells, free and bound zinc(ii) levels were enhanced more markedly as compared to PNT1A. PNT1A produced 4.2-fold less MT compared to PC3. PNT1A cells showed a 4.8-fold increase trend (r = 0.94; p = 0.005); PC-3 did show a significant trend at MT1 and MT2 protein levels (r = 0.93; p = 0.02) with nearly ten-fold increase after 100 μM zinc(ii) treatment. In terms of redox state, PNT1A had a predominance of reduced GSH forms (GSH : GSSG ratio > 1), when exposed to zinc(ii) compared to PC3, where predominance of oxidised forms remains at all concentrations. IC(50) differs significantly when determined by MTT and real-time impedance-based assays due to dependence of impedance on cell morphology and adhesion.

To evaluate the clinical outcome of patients upgraded by the ISUP criteria, the histologic slides of 1240 consecutive radical prostatectomy specimens at a single institution were reviewed, and each case of adenocarcinoma was graded on the basis of the original and modified Gleason criteria. A total of 806 patients with prostate cancer of classical Gleason score 3+3=6 or 3+4=7 and modified Gleason score 6 to 8 were analyzed with a median overall follow-up of 12.6 years.

We investigated contemporary trends in the use of these treatments.  Materials and methods:   Annualized case log data for incontinence surgeries from certifying and recertifying urologists were obtained from the ABU (American Board of Urology), ranging from 2004 to 2010. Chi-square tests and logistic regression models were used to evaluate the association between surgeon characteristics (type of certification, annual volume, practice type and practice location) and the use of incontinence procedures.  Results:   Among the 2,036 nonpediatric case logs examined the number of incontinence treatments reported for certification has steadily increased over time from 1,936 to 3,366 treatments per year from 2004 to 2010 (p = 0.008). Nearly a fifth of urologists reported placing at least 1 sling. The proportion of endoscopic procedures decreased from 80% of all incontinence procedures in 2004 to 60% in 2010, but they remained the exclusive incontinence procedure performed by 49% of urologists. A urologist's increased use of endoscopic treatments was associated with a decreased likelihood of performing a sling procedure (OR 0.5, p <0.0005). Artificial urinary sphincter use remained stable, accounting for 12% of procedures.  Conclusions:   Incontinence procedures are on the rise. Urethral slings have been widely adopted and account for the largest increase among treatment modalities.

Moreover, we examined the effect of incorporating positive SM as a higher stage on the discrimination accuracy of the current TNM staging system.  Materials and methods:   We evaluated 1,503 prostate cancer patients treated with radical prostatectomy, between 1998 and 2010. Only individuals with pT2N0 or pT3aN0, without neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant therapy, were included. Cox regression analyses tested the relationship between SM status (negative [R0] vs. positive [R1]) and BCR rate, after stratification according to T stage. Predictive accuracy of the current T stage and of a novel T stage, which consider positive SM as a higher stage, was quantified with Harrell's concordance index.  Results:   Positive SM rate was 20.3%. The 5-year BCR rates were 96%, 82%, 78%, and 62% for patients with, respectively, pT2R0, pT2R1, pT3aR0, and pT3a1 (all P ≤ 0.03). In multivariable analyses, the BCR rate was 3.6-, 2.5-, and 6.0-fold higher (all P < 0.001) in patients with, respectively, pT2R1, pT3aR0, and pT3aR1 stage relative to patients with pT2R0 stage. The maximum univariable (14.1%) and multivariable (6.9%) discrimination accuracy gains were observed, when tumor stage was stratified into pT2R0 vs. pT2R1/pT3R0 vs. pT3R1.  Conclusions:   The presence of positive SM at radical prostatectomy (RP) specimen substantially increases the BCR risk. Patients with pT2R1 have similar BCR risk to patients with pT3aR0.

Objective:   To examine the efficacy and oncologic safety of a systematic neurovascular structure-adjacent frozen-section examination (NeuroSAFE) during NS radical prostatectomy (RP).  Design, setting, and participants:   From January 2002 to June 2011, 11 069 consecutive RPs were performed at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf. Of these, 5392 (49%) were conducted with NeuroSAFE.  Surgical procedure:   Our NeuroSAFE approach included the whole laterorectal circumference of the prostate to determine the SM status of the complete neurovascular tissue-corresponding prostatic surface.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The impact of NeuroSAFE on NS frequency, SM status, and biochemical recurrence (BCR) was analyzed by chi-square test, and by Kaplan-Meier analyses in propensity score-based matched cohorts.  Results and limitations:   Positive SMs (PSMs) were detected in 1368 (25%) NeuroSAFE RPs, leading to a secondary resection of the ipsilateral neurovascular tissue. Secondary wide resection resulted in conversion to a definitive negative SM (NSM) status in 1180 (86%) patients. In NeuroSAFE RPs, frequency of NS was significantly higher (all stages: 97% vs 81%; pT2: 99% vs 92%; pT3a: 94% vs 72%; pT3b: 88% vs 40%; p<0.0001) and PSM rates were significantly lower (all stages: 15% vs 22%; pT2: 7% vs 12%; pT3a: 21% vs 32%; p<0.0001) than in the matched non-NeuroSAFE RPs. In propensity score-based comparisons, NeuroSAFE had no negative impact on BCR (pT2, p=0.06; pT3a, p=0.17, pT3b, p=0.99), and BCR-free survival of patients with conversion to NSM did not differ significantly from patients with primarily NSM (pT2, p=0.16; pT3, p=0.26). The accuracy of our NeuroSAFE approach was 97% with a false-negative rate of 2.5%. The major limitations of this study are its retrospective nature and relatively short follow-up.

A new DuoRotate manual system developed by Richard Wolf (KeyPort; Richard Wolf GmbH, Knittlingen, Germany) can be applied to RP.  Objectives:   Our aim was to describe the surgical technique and report early outcomes of KeyPort LESS-RP to determine if this procedure is feasible and safe.  Design, setting, and participants:   Prospective study performed between October 2011 and January 2012 to standardize LESS-RP. A total of 31 procedures were performed (10 with and 21 without neurovascular preservation, 8 with and 23 without pelvic lymph node dissection).  Surgical procedure:   LESS-RP was performed using the methods outlined in the manuscript. All patients underwent LESS RP by the same surgical team. Access was achieved via a tri-channel reusable KeyPort and one 3.5-mm extra port to facilitate urethrovesical anastomosis and drainage extraction.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Preoperative, perioperative, and pathologic outcomes data are presented.  Results and limitations:   The mean age of the patients was 64 yr; mean body mass index: 30.7 kg/m(2); mean prostate-specific antigen level: 7 ng/ml; mean operative time: 207 min; and mean estimated blood loss: 258 ml. The average length of stay was 2.9 d and visual analog pain score (range: 0 [no pain] to 10) at day 2 was 1.2. Five focal positive margins (16.7%) were encountered (4.4% for pT2 and 57.1% for pT3). Five cases (16.7%) were pT2a, 3 (10%) were pT2b, 15 (50%) were pT2c, and 7 (23.3%) were pT3a. Lymph node dissection results were negative in all patients. Major complications occurred in two patients (6.5%) (hypercapnia with respiratory acidosis and rectourethral fistula) and minor complications in four (12.9%) (atrial fibrillation, orchitis, transfusion, and vomiting). No case required additional analgesia. Incision was totally hidden in the umbilicus. Study limitations included short follow-up (mean: 20.2 ± 4.1 wk), premature functional data, and absence of a comparative cohort.

For further development of CTCs as a biomarker, we compared the performance of different protocols for CTC detection in murine breast cancer xenograft models (MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468 and KPL-4). Blood samples were taken from tumour bearing animals (20 to 200 mm2) and analysed for CTCs using 1. an epithelial marker based enrichment method (AdnaTest), 2. an antibody independent technique, targeting human gene transcripts (qualitative PCR), and 3. an antibody-independent approach, targeting human DNA-sequences (quantitative PCR). Further, gene expression changes associated with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) were determined with an EMT-specific PCR assay.  Methods:   We used the commercially available Adna Test, RT-PCR on human housekeeping genes and a PCR on AluJ sequences to detect CTCs in xenografts models. Phenotypic changes in CTCs were tested with the commercially available ""Human Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition RT-Profiler PCR Array"".  Results:   Although the AdnaTest detects as few as 1 tumour cell in 1 ml of mouse blood spiking experiments, no CTCs were detectable with this approach in vivo despite visible metastasis formation. The presence of CTCs could, however, be demonstrated by PCR targeting human transcripts or DNA-sequences - without epithelial pre-enrichment. The failure of CTC detection by the AdnaTest resulted from downregulation of EpCAM, whereas mesenchymal markers like Twist and EGFR were upregulated on CTCs. Such a change in the expression profile during metastatic spread of tumour cells has already been reported and was linked to a biological program termed epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT).  Conclusions:   The use of EpCAM-based enrichment techniques leads to the failure to detect CTC populations that have undergone EMT. Our findings may explain clinical results where low CTC numbers have been reported even in patients with late metastatic cancers. These results are a starting point for the identification of new markers for detection or capture of CTCs, including the mesenchymal-like subpopulations.""","""['Tobias M Gorges', 'Ingeborg Tinhofer', 'Michael Drosch', 'Lars Röse', 'Thomas M Zollner', 'Thomas Krahn', 'Oliver von Ahsen']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['EpCAM-Independent Enrichment of Circulating Tumor Cells in Metastatic Breast Cancer.', 'EpCAM-independent isolation of circulating tumor cells with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and cancer stem cell phenotypes using ApoStream® in patients with breast cancer treated with primary systemic therapy.', 'Circulating tumor cell enumeration with a combination of epithelial cell adhesion molecule- and cell-surface vimentin-based methods for monitoring breast cancer therapeutic response.', 'Circulating tumour cells: the evolving concept and the inadequacy of their enrichment by EpCAM-based methodology for basic and clinical cancer research.', 'Circulating Tumor Cells: A Review of Non-EpCAM-Based Approaches for Cell Enrichment and Isolation.', 'Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition Gene Signature in Circulating Melanoma Cells: Biological and Clinical Relevance.', 'Cluster-Wells: A Technology for Routine and Rapid Isolation of Extremely Rare Circulating Tumor Cell Clusters from Unprocessed Whole Blood.', 'Utilization of Circulating Tumor Cells in the Management of Solid Tumors.', 'Investigation of Inlet Conditions in The Mixing Process of Nanoparticles and Blood in a T-Shaped Microfluidic Reactor with Small Rectangular Cavities.', 'Ex vivo expansion of circulating tumour cells (CTCs).']"""

Methods:   The response of metastatic CaP cells to 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU), Pemetrexed or Tomudex was determined using cell count assays, flow cytometry and PARP cleavage analysis. Quantitative-PCR, ELISA and immunoblots were employed to determine effects of drugs or CXCL8 administration on target gene/protein expression.  Results:   Administration of 5-FU but not pemetrexed potentiated CXCL8 secretion and increased CXCR1 and CXCR2 gene expression in metastatic PC3 cells. Consistent with this, the inhibition of CXCL8 signaling using a CXCR2 antagonist, AZ10397767, increased the cytotoxicity of 5-FU by 4-fold (P<0.001), and increased 5-FU-induced apoptosis in PC3 cells (P<0.01). In contrast, while administration of AZ10397767 had no effect on the sensitivity of pemetrexed, the CXCR2 antagonist exerted the greatest effect in increasing the sensitivity of PC3 cells to Tomudex, a directed thymidylate synthase (TS) inhibitor. Subsequent experiments confirmed that administration of recombinant human CXCL8 increased TS expression, a response mediated in part by the CXCR2 receptor. Moreover, siRNA-mediated knockdown of the CXCL8-target gene Bcl-2 increased the sensitivity of PC3 cells to 5-FU.

CPIC (1-(3-(2-chlorophenoxy) propyl)-1H-indole-3-carbonitrile) was identified as a small molecule that blocks AR transactivation to a greater extent than other steroid receptors. CPIC inhibited AR-mediated proliferation of androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cell lines, with minimal toxicity in AR-negative cell lines. CPIC treatment also reduced the anchorage-independent growth of LAPC-4 prostate cancer cells. CPIC functioned as a pure antagonist by inhibiting the expression of AR-regulated genes in LAPC-4 cells that express wild-type AR and exhibited weak agonist activity in LNCaP cells that express the mutant AR-T877A. CPIC treatment did not reduce AR levels or alter its nuclear localization. We used chromatin immunoprecipitation to identify the site of action of CPIC.

Extracted samples were split into equal parts for analysis on the gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry platforms.  Results:   Of the 292 identified metabolites, 56 changed significantly (P < 0.05) from baseline to 3 months. Notable changes were grouped as follows: (i) Multiple steroids were lower at 3 months, consistent with the effect of therapy on gonadal androgen synthesis. (ii) Most bile acids and their metabolites were higher during treatment. Cholesterol levels changed very little. (iii) Markers of lipid beta-oxidation (acetyl-carnitines and ketone bodies) and omega-oxidation were lower at 3 months. (iv) Two previously identified biomarkers of insulin resistance (2-hydroxybutyrate and branch chain keto-acid dehydrogenase complex products) were stable to lower at 3 months.  Conclusions:   Unbiased metabolomic analyses revealed expected, novel, and unexpected results. Steroid levels fell, consistent with the effects of ADT. Most bile acids and their metabolites increased during ADT, a novel finding. Biomarkers of lipid metabolism and insulin resistance fell, unexpected given that ADT has been shown to increase fasting insulin.""","""['Philip J Saylor', 'Edward D Karoly', 'Matthew R Smith']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Clin Cancer Res""","""['The effect of androgen deprivation therapy on fasting serum lipid and glucose parameters.', 'Androgen-deprivation therapy and metabolic syndrome in men with prostate cancer.', 'Androgen deprivation in men with prostate cancer is associated with an increased rate of bone loss.', 'Androgen deprivation therapy with Leuprolide acetate for treatment of advanced prostate cancer.', 'Androgen deprivation therapy, insulin resistance, and cardiovascular mortality: an inconvenient truth.', '2 Hydroxybutyric Acid-Producing Bacteria in Gut Microbiome and Fusobacterium nucleatum Regulates 2 Hydroxybutyric Acid Level In Vivo.', 'Molecular Mechanisms of Noncoding RNA in the Occurrence of Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Histone methyltransferase KMT2D mediated lipid metabolism via peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma in prostate cancer.', 'Carbon Ion Radiotherapy Induce Metabolic Inhibition After Functional Imaging-Guided Simultaneous Integrated Boost for Prostate Cancer.', 'How previous treatment changes the metabolomic profile in patients with metastatic breast cancer.']"""

Using an experimental prostate cancer metastasis model, we investigated the effects of cyclophosphamide, a bone marrow-suppressive chemotherapeutic drug, on the development and growth of metastatic tumors in bone. Priming the murine host with cyclophosphamide before intracardiac tumor cell inoculation was found to significantly promote tumor localization and subsequent growth in bone. Shortly after cyclophosphamide treatment, there was an abrupt expansion of myeloid lineage cells in the bone marrow and the peripheral blood, associated with increases in cytokines with myelogenic potential such as C-C chemokine ligand (CCL)2, interleukin (IL)-6, and VEGF-A. More importantly, neutralizing host-derived murine CCL2, but not IL-6, in the premetastatic murine host significantly reduced the prometastatic effects of cyclophosphamide. Together, our findings suggest that bone marrow perturbation by cytotoxic chemotherapy can contribute to bone metastasis via a transient increase in bone marrow myeloid cells and myelogenic cytokines.

Dysregulation of miRNA expression can promote cancer formation and progression. Research has largely focused on the function and expression of single miRNAs. However, complex physiological processes require the interaction, regulation and coordination of many molecules including miRNAs and proteins. Highly connected molecules often serve important roles in the cell. A protein-protein interaction network of established miRNA targets confirmed these proteins to be highly connected and essential to the cell, affecting tumorigenesis, cell growth/proliferation, cellular death, cell assembly, and maintenance pathways. This analysis showed that miRNAs contribute to the overall health of the prostate, and their aberrant expression destabilized homeostatic balance.

Design and setting:   Cross-sectional study in Middle Eastern men with BPH and prostatitis or BPH only.  Patients and methods:   Transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsies were collected from 106 patients suspected of having prostate cancer; however, the histology revealed BPH. Upon further pathological examination, 56 of these cases were identified as BPH with prostatitis and classified as: acute prostatitis (n=13); active chronic prostatitis (n=32); and, chronic inactive prostatitis (n=12). Serum IL-6 levels and EZH2 mRNA expression were measured and compared between patient groups.  Results:   EZH2 mRNA was overexpressed in BPH with prostatitis patients compared to BPH only patients (P<.0001). BPH with active chronic prostatitis had higher EZH2 expression than BPH with acute or chronic inactive prostatitis compared to BPH only (P=.05 and .73, respectively). EZH2 mRNA expression showed a negative correlation with IL-6 concentrations in BPH with prostatitis patients (rs=-0.31, P=.02). EZH2 overexpression was associated with an increased risk of having BPH with prostatitis (crude odds ratio 0.20, 95% CI 0.06-0.65, P=.0076).  Conclusions:   EZH2 mRNA expression correlates positively with prostatitis conditions associated with BPH and negatively with serum IL-6 levels.

Monte Carlo dose calculations were used to investigate the dosimetric effect of trace elements present in normal or cancerous human tissues. The effect of individual traces (atomic number Z = 11-30) was studied in soft tissue irradiated by low-energy brachytherapy sources. Three other tissue types (prostate, adipose and mammary gland) were also simulated with varying trace concentrations to quantify the contribution of each trace to the dose distribution. The dose differences between cancerous and healthy prostate tissues were calculated in single- and multi-source geometries. The presence of traces in a tissue produces a difference in the dose distribution that is dependent on Z and the concentration of the trace. Low-Z traces (Na) have a negligible effect (<0.3%) in all tissues, while higher Z (K) had a larger effect (>3%). There is a potentially significant difference in the dose distribution between cancerous and healthy prostate tissues (4%) and even larger if compared to the trace-free composition (15%) in both single- and multi-sourced geometries. Trace elements have a non-negligible (up to 8% in prostate D(90)) effect on the dose in tissues irradiated with low-energy photon sources.

No data have been reported in patients with prostate cancer about the relation between serum sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and bone metabolism. We found that SHBG levels were inversely related to bone mass and vertebral fractures in this population.  Introduction:   Fractures are increased among prostate cancer patients, especially those on androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), but few data are available on the role of SHBG in their bone status. Our objective was to analyze the relation between serum SHBG and bone metabolism in prostate cancer patients.  Methods:   This is a cross-sectional study including 91 subjects with prostate cancer (54 % with ADT). We measured serum levels of SHBG and sex steroids, bone mineral density (BMD) by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, and prevalent radiographic vertebral fractures.  Results:   SHBG levels were inversely related to BMD (femoral neck: r = -0.299, p = 0.00; total hip: r = -0.259, p = 0.019). Subjects with osteoporosis had higher SHBG concentrations than patients without osteoporosis (60.97 ± 39.56 vs 44.45 ± 23.32 nmol/l, p = 0.022). Patients with SHBG levels in the first quartile (>57.6 nmol/l) had an odds ratio (OR) for osteoporosis of 2.59 (95 % CI, 1.30-5.12; p = 0.009) compared with patients with lower SHBG levels. In patients with SHBG >57.6 nmol/l, the OR for vertebral fractures was 2.34 (95 % CI, 1.15-4.78; p = 0.034). The calculated OR was higher after adjustment for age (OR, 5.16; 95 % CI, 1.09-24.49; p = 0.039), estrogens (OR, 6.45; 95 % CI, 1.44-28.95; p = 0.023), and androgens (OR, 5.51; 95 % CI, 1.36-22.37; p = 0.017).

In this study, we report an approximate method for rapid calculation of dose when setup errors and anatomical changes occur during proton therapy. This fast dose approximation method calculates new dose distributions under various circumstances based on the prior knowledge of dose distribution from a reference setting. In order to validate the method, we calculated and compared the dose distributions from our approximation method to the dose distributions calculated from a clinically commissioned treatment planning system which was used as the ground truth. The overall accuracy of the proposed method was tested against varying degrees of setup error and anatomical deformation for selected patient cases. The setup error was simulated by rigid shifts of the patient; while the anatomical deformation was introduced using weekly acquired repeat CT data sets. We evaluated the agreement between the dose approximation method and full dose recalculation using a 3D gamma index and the root-mean-square (RMS) and maximum deviation of the cumulative dose volume histograms (cDVHs). The average passing rate of 3D gamma analysis under 3% dose and 3 mm distance-to-agreement criteria were 96% and 89% for setup errors and severe anatomy changes, respectively. The average of RMS and maximum deviation of the cDVHs under the setup error was 0.5% and 1.5%, respectively for all structures considered. Similarly, the average of RMS and maximum deviations under the weekly anatomical change were 0.6% and 2.7%, respectively.

Painful bone metastases require regular control and treatment. Systemic palliative radiotherapy using beta-emitting radionuclides is an alternative method to analgesics and external beam radiotherapy. The aim of the study was to establish the efficacy and risk of side effects of radionuclide therapy in patients with bone metastases.  Material and methods:   Strontium-89 (Sr-89) therapy was performed in 49 patients, 14 women and 35 men, aged 42-82 (mean 62) years with bone metastases confirmed by MDP-Tc99m whole body scan. The primary tumour was prostate cancer in 28 patients, breast cancer in 14, bladder cancer in 2, lung cancer in 2, gastric cancer in 2, and renal cancer in 1 patient. Intravenous injection of 150 MBq of Sr-89 was given and patients were observed for at least 3 months. Blood count, intensity of pain, drugs intake, life activity, and duration of effect were assigned 0-3 points. The overall response index was very good when the points totalled 10-12, good - 7-9, satisfactory - 4-6, poor - 2-3 and no response 0-1 points. Haemotoxicity was evaluated according to the Common Toxicity Criteria of the World Health Organisation (WHO).  Results:   We found a very good response in 10 (20%) patients, good in 20 (41%), satisfactory in 8 (16%), poor in 2 (4%), and no response in 9 (19%) patients. Transient haemotoxicity of the Sr-89 therapy was observed in 39 (80%) patients. The mean decrease in platelets and leukocytes was 33-35%, but the haemoglobin concentration was reduced by only 15% in comparison to baseline values. The majority of patients did not require any treatment for haematologic side effects. Hospitalization was necessary in only 2 patients with grade 4 CTC WHO.  Conclusion:   Palliative radionuclide treatment of painful bone metastases with Strontium-89 in various primary tumours is in most cases an effective therapy with limited haemotoxicity.""","""['Piotr Zorga', 'Bozena Birkenfeld', 'Maria H Listewnik', 'Hanna Piwowarska-Bilska']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Ann Acad Med Stetin""","""['Strontium-89 in palliative treatement of painfull bone metastases.', 'Use of strontium-89 in endocrine-refractory prostate cancer metastatic to bone.

A total of 4,407 cases of histologically confirmed new cancer cases were registered at the Medical Records Department (MRD) of SKIMS from a period between January, 2005 and April 2010. Among 4407 cancers, 2,457 (55.7 %) were men and 1,950 (44.3 %) were women. Stomach cancer is the leading one with an average frequency of 19.2 % followed by esophagus and lung as 16.5 % and 14.6 %, respectively. Stomach (23 %) and lung (21 %) are the leading cancers in men while as esophageal cancer tops (18.3 %) in women followed by breast cancer (16.6 %). This distribution of cancer types is strikingly different from that in the rest of India where oropharyngeal cancer is most common form. Among urinogenital cancers, bladder cancer was observed to primarily affect Kashmiri population (5.9 %) followed by prostate cancer (2.1 %) and renal carcinoma (1.1 %).

Also no information exist on the eventual modulation exerted by the neurotoxin on Phospholipase A2 (PLA2) expression in prostate cancer. The aim of this study was to evaluate the activity of BoNT/A on cell growth and expression of PLA2 in prostate cancer lines.  Materials and methods:   PC-3 and LNCaP cell lines were exposed to BoNT/A (Xeomin®), different doses and time of exposure. Presence of SV2 receptors (SV2-A and SV2-B) for the neurotoxin was also investigated. The expression of P-Ser505-cPLA2-α (phosphorylated enzyme) was performed immunofluorescence.  Results:   After 96 hours of BoNT/A administration a 20% reduction of cell growth in LNCaP and 25% in PC-3 were observed. SV-2 receptors were expressed in both cell lines. No cPLA2-α total expression was found in LnCaP. In PC-3 there was a high expression of cPLA2-α total which was not modified after BoNT/A treatment. In both LNCap and PC-3 the expression of P-Ser505-cPLA2-α (phosphorylated enzyme) increases significantly after treatment with [10 U/ml] of BoNT/A.  Conclusions:   LNCaP and PC-3 cell lines are sensitive to treatment with BoNT/A which probably enters the cells by SV2 receptors.

Common genetic alterations in prostate cancer include losses of NKX3.1 (8p21) and PTEN (10q23), gains of AR (the androgen receptor gene) and fusion of ETS family transcription factor genes with androgen-responsive promoters. Recurrent somatic base-pair substitutions are believed to be less contributory in prostate tumorigenesis but have not been systematically analyzed in large cohorts. Here, we sequenced the exomes of 112 prostate tumor and normal tissue pairs. New recurrent mutations were identified in multiple genes, including MED12 and FOXA1. SPOP was the most frequently mutated gene, with mutations involving the SPOP substrate-binding cleft in 6-15% of tumors across multiple independent cohorts. Prostate cancers with mutant SPOP lacked ETS family gene rearrangements and showed a distinct pattern of genomic alterations.

The effects of these carcinogens may undergo modification by the enzymes responsible for their detoxification and/or activation. In this study, we investigated genetic polymorphisms in nine carcinogen metabolism enzymes and their modifying effects on the association between white or dark fish consumption and prostate cancer (PCA) risk. We genotyped 497 localized and 936 advanced PCA cases and 760 controls from the California Collaborative Case-Control Study of Prostate Cancer. Three polymorphisms, EPHX1 Tyr113His, CYP1B1 Leu432Val and GSTT1 null/present, were associated with localized PCA risk. The PTGS2 765 G/C polymorphism modified the association between white fish consumption and advanced PCA risk (interaction P 5 0.002), with high white fish consumption being positively associated with risk only among carriers of the C allele. This effect modification by PTGS2 genotype was stronger when restricted to consumption of well-done white fish (interaction P 5 0.021). These findings support the hypotheses that changes in white fish brought upon by high-temperature cooking methods, such as carcinogen accumulation and/or fatty acid composition changes, may contribute to prostate carcinogenesis. However, the gene-diet interactions should be interpreted with caution given the limited sample size.

Subtyping was based on recA, tly, and Tc12S sequences. The MLST analysis identified 23 sequence types and displayed a superior ability to discriminate P. acnes isolates compared to DiversiLab and the subtyping. The highest discriminatory index was found when using seven genes. DiversiLab was better able to differentiate the isolates compared to the MLST clonal complexes of sequence types.

Most studies have suggested that the absolute serum testosterone and free testosterone levels are not related to PCa risk. However, to date, the concurrent effect of free and total testosterone levels has not been evaluated. In particular, the association of the %FT (free testosterone/total testosterone) with PCa risk has not been explored.  Methods:   From 2006 to 2010, we collected data on 812 white Italian men with no history of PCa who underwent 12-core biopsy. The testosterone, free testosterone, and %FT (free testosterone/total testosterone) were examined as predictors of low-grade (Gleason score of ≤ 6) and high-grade (Gleason score ≥ 7) PCa using crude and adjusted multinomial logistic regression analysis.  Results:   On multivariate analysis, testosterone (P ≥ .11) and free testosterone (P ≥ .45) were not significantly associated with low- or high-grade PCa. A greater %FT level significantly predicted high-grade PCa on both crude (P = .01) and multivariate (P = .02) analysis but not low-grade PCa (P ≥ .38). When examined in tertiles, men in the greatest %FT tertile had a significant twofold increased risk of high-grade PCa (odds ratio 2.04, 95% confidence interval 1.23-3.37, P = .005).  Conclusion:   In white Italian men, a greater %FT level was associated with an increased risk of high-grade PCa on initial prostate biopsy.

We compared methylation at histone H3 lysine 9 at the AR promoter region between androgen dependent and castration resistant prostate cancer by chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. The cytotoxic effect of adenosine dialdehyde on prostate cancer was also evaluated in vitro and in vivo.  Results:   Adenosine dialdehyde suppressed the monomethylation and dimethylation of histone H3 lysine 9 and inhibited Twist1 as well as androgen receptor expression, which are critical for the survival and growth of androgen dependent, androgen sensitive and castration resistant prostate cancer cells in which monomethylated histone H3 lysine 9 increased at the 5' untranslated region of the AR gene. As a result, adenosine dialdehyde had a cytotoxic effect on androgen dependent, androgen sensitive and castration resistant prostate cancer cells in vitro. Adenosine dialdehyde also suppressed prostate cancer growth in vivo in a mouse xenograft model.  Conclusions:   Results indicate that the methyltransferase inhibitor adenosine dialdehyde is a promising, novel therapeutic compound for prostate cancer.""","""['Masaki Shiota', 'Ario Takeuchi', 'Akira Yokomizo', 'Eiji Kashiwagi', 'Katsunori Tatsugami', 'Seiji Naito']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Gender specific differences in bladder cancer.', 'Androgen receptor-dependent regulation of Bcl-xL expression: Implication in prostate cancer progression.', 'Effect of histone deacetylase and DNA methyltransferase inhibitors on the expression of the androgen receptor gene in androgen-independent prostate cancer cell lines.', 'Identification of EP4 as a potential target for the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer using a novel xenograft model.', 'Transcriptional network of androgen receptor in prostate cancer progression.', 'Androgens as therapy for androgen receptor-positive castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'DNA and protein methyltransferases inhibition by adenosine dialdehyde reduces the proliferation and migration of breast and lung cancer cells by downregulating autophagy.', 'PRMT5: a putative oncogene and therapeutic target in prostate cancer.', 'Protein arginine methylation: an emerging regulator of the cell cycle.']"""

Due to increased G protein activation the GNB3 825T allele, a truncated form of the G3 protein, is associated with enhanced signal transduction capacity. This splice variant is associated with various malignant diseases. We investigated the possible association of GNB3 gene polymorphism with prostate cancer and its clinicopathological characteristics.  Materials and methods:   Using polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism the allele frequency of the C825T polymorphism was investigated in 172 patients with prostate cancer. Results were compared with those of 344 age matched, healthy blood donors.  Results:   The frequency of the GNB3 825T allele in patients with prostate cancer was significantly higher than in controls (49.1% vs 42.7%, OR 3.76, p = 0.003). Patients with prostate cancer who had the TT genotype were at 2.52 times higher risk for prostate cancer than the CC genotype referent group (OR 2.22, 95% CI 1.18-4.22, p = 0.008). Accordingly a significant increased risk of advanced disease was observed in men carrying the GNB3 TT genotype compared with those homozygous for the wild-type C allele (OR 6.24, 95% CI 4.16-12.45, p = 0.001). Men lacking the C825 allele were at approximately sevenfold higher risk for high grade (Gleason score greater than 7) prostate cancer than men with the GNB3 CC genotype.

Recently aldehyde dehydrogenase activity was used to isolate stem cells of various cancer and normal cells. We evaluated the aldehyde dehydrogenase activity of the human prostate cancer cell line 22Rv1 (ATCC®) with the ALDEFLUOR® assay and determined its potency as prostate cancer stem-like/cancer initiating cells.  Materials and methods:   The human prostate cancer cell line 22Rv1 was labeled with ALDEFLUOR reagent and analyzed by flow cytometry. ALDH1(high) and ALDH1(low) cells were isolated and tumorigenicity was evaluated by xenograft transplantation into NOD/SCID mice. Tumor sphere forming ability was evaluated by culturing in a floating condition. Invasion capability was evaluated by the Matrigel™ invasion assay. Gene expression profiling was assessed by microarrays and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction.  Results:   ALDH1(high) cells were detected in 6.8% of 22Rv1 cells, which showed significantly higher tumorigenicity than ALDH1(low) cells in NOD/SCID mice (p < 0.05). Gene expression profiling revealed higher expression of the stem cell related genes PROM1 and NKX3-1 in ALDH1(high) cells than in ALDH1(low) cells. ALDH1(high) cells also showed higher invasive capability and sphere forming capability than ALDH1(low) cells.  Conclusions:   Results indicate that cancer stem-like/cancer initiating cells are enriched in the ALDH1(high) population of the prostate cancer cell line 22Rv1. This approach may provide a breakthrough to further clarify prostate cancer stem-like/cancer initiating cells.

We examined the effects of vandetanib, an inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGFR), EGFR, and rearranged during transfection (RET) tyrosine-kinase activities, alone or combined with docetaxel, on PC3 docetaxel-sensitive (PC3wt) or docetaxel-resistant (PC3R) AIPC cell growth in vivo and in vitro.  Methods:   Mice bearing PC3wt or PC3R tumors were treated for 3 weeks with vandetanib (25 or 50 mg/kg/d p.o., 5 d/wk), docetaxel (10 or 30 mg/kg i.p., 1 d/wk), or their combination (low or high doses). Xenograft tumors were analyzed for expression of Ki-67, EGFR, VEGFR2, and production of VEGFA.  Results:   On PC3wt, vandetanib at both doses stimulated tumor growth, whereas docetaxel at both doses exerted strong growth-inhibiting effects. The low-dose vandetanib-docetaxel combination resulted in tumor growth similar to that of control, whereas the high-dose combination induced a significant antiproliferative effect. In contrast, on PC3R, the low-dose of vandetanib had no effect on tumor growth, whereas the high-dose of vandetanib significantly inhibited tumor growth. Docetaxel at both doses exerted moderate and transient antitumor effects. The combination of high-dose vandetanib with high-dose docetaxel resulted in antiproliferative effects, which were lower than expected from the sum of individual drug effects. Importantly, tumor analyses revealed overexpression of the EGFR/VEGFR pathways in PC3R relative to PC3wt.  Conclusion:   Present results suggest that vandetanib should not be associated with docetaxel in treatment-naive or docetaxel-resistant prostate cancer (CaP).

Materials and methods:   Patients treated at the Center for Prostate Disease Research between June 2003 and February 2010 were offered enrollment into a HRQoL study that entailed a baseline evaluation before prostate biopsy and at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, and 30 months thereafter. The instruments used were the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC), EPIC Demographic, and Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form 36 (SF-36). A Student's t-test and ANOVA were used to examine the association between HRQoL scores, patient demographic, and disease features. Multivariable regression models were used to analyze change over time. Estimates of risk, corresponding confidence intervals, and P values are presented for these longitudinal findings.  Results:   The study group was comprised of 595 patients. African Americans (AA) had slightly lower baseline raw scores in all EPIC and SF-36 HRQoL domains, but on bivariate analysis, there was no statistical difference in change of scores over time. Radical prostatectomy (RP) led to the greatest decline in urinary function. Bowel function significantly worsened with the addition of hormone therapy (HT) to external beam radiation therapy (EBRT). Sexual bother and function had a marked decline in all active treatment options. Despite these changes, there were no differences in overall satisfaction. SF-36 domains were not affected by RP, whereas EBRT and EBRT + HT had universal impact. For the 12- to 24-month interval, specifically, patients who underwent EBRT fared worse over this time period, showing continued worsening of urinary bother, hormonal function, physical role, physical component summary, and overall satisfaction. Patients who underwent RP did not show any further decline in the 12- to 24-month interval, but instead showed improvement.  Conclusions:   Because of the protracted nature of recovery after surgery, delayed onset of effects from radiation, potential interval decline secondary to age-related symptoms, and longevity of patients with prostate cancer, determination of long-term HRQoL outcomes is integral.

Objective:   This study evaluates whether the early use of PADT affects the subsequent receipt of additional palliative cancer treatments such as chemotherapy, palliative radiation therapy, or intervention for spinal cord compression or bladder outlet obstruction.  Design, setting, and participants:   This longitudinal population-based cohort study consists of Medicare patients aged ≥ 66 yr diagnosed with localized PCa from 1992 to 2006 in areas covered by the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) program. SEER-Medicare linked data through 2009 were used to identify the use of PADT and palliative cancer therapy.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Instrumental variable analysis methods were used to minimize confounding effects. Confidence intervals were derived from the bootstrap estimates.  Results and limitations:   This study includes 29 775 men who did not receive local therapy for T1-T2 PCa within the first year of cancer diagnosis. Among low-risk patients (Gleason score 2-7 in 1992-2002 and Gleason score 2-6 in 2003-2006) with a median age of 78 yr and a median follow-up of 10.3 yr, PADT was associated with a 25% higher use of chemotherapy (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.25; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.08-1.44) and a borderline higher use of any palliative cancer treatment (HR: 1.07; 95% CI, 0.97-1.19) within 10 yr of diagnosis in regions with high PADT use compared with regions with low PADT use.

As the spinal compression frequently occurs ventrally, performing a simple posterior laminectomy alone is generally ineffective and dangerous. Many aggressive surgical strategies have been developed to improve outcomes for patients with metastatic spine disease. These strategies are associated with high morbidity and complication rates, especially in patients with numerous neoplasm-associated comorbidities, which can limit their indication in patients with a limited life expectancy. The authors performed a prospective evaluation of minimally invasive decompression and stabilization for the palliative management of symptomatic thoracolumbar spine metastasis.  Methods:   Ten patients with metastasis to the thoracolumbar spine and neurological compromise underwent minimally invasive transpedicular vertebrectomy and spinal cord decompression through a tubular expandable retractor. Percutaneous stabilization was also systematically performed to ensure spinal stability.  Results:   No complications during the procedure were reported. The mean operative duration was 170 minutes and the mean estimated blood loss was 400 ml. The postoperative course of all patients was uneventful, with the exception of 1 benign urinary tract infection. Eight patients (80%) improved at least 1 Frankel grade.

The coupling of TiO(2) and CdS NPs results in a cathodic ECL intensity 14.7 times stronger than that of the pure TiO(2) NTs electrode, which could be efficiently quenched by the CdTe-MWNTs. The enhanced mechanism of TiO(2) NTs ECL by CdS NPs was studied in detail by cyclic voltammetry and ECL spectroscopy. The strong absorption of the CdTe-MWNTs in the wavelength range of 400-800 nm renders them highly efficient for ECL quenching labeled on anti-PSA antibody. Based on a sandwich structure, we developed an ECL immunoassay method for the sensitive and selective detection of PSA. The ECL intensity decrement was logarithmically related to the concentration of the PSA in the range of 1.0 fg mL(-1) to 10 pg mL(-1) with a detection limit of 1 fg mL(-1). Human serum samples were then tested using the proposed immunoassay with excellent correlations, suggesting that the proposed immunoassay method is of great promise in clinical screening of cancer biomarkers.""","""['Chun-Yuan Tian', 'Wei-Wei Zhao', 'Jing Wang', 'Jing-Juan Xu', 'Hong-Yuan Chen']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Analyst""","""['Enhanced electrochemiluminescence quenching of CdS:Mn nanocrystals by CdTe QDs-doped silica nanoparticles for ultrasensitive detection of thrombin.', 'TiO2 nanotubes loaded with CdS nanocrystals as enhanced emitters of electrochemiluminescence: application to an assay for prostate-specific antigen.', 'An electrochemiluminescence sensor for the detection of prostate protein antigen based on the graphene quantum dots infilled TiO2 nanotube arrays.', 'Label-free photoelectrochemical immunosensor based on CdTe/CdS co-sensitized TiO2 nanotube array structure for octachlorostyrene detection.', 'Highly sensitive electrochemiluminescence detection of single-nucleotide polymorphisms based on isothermal cycle-assisted triple-stem probe with dual-nanoparticle label.', 'An electrochemiluminescence resonance energy transfer biosensor for the detection of circulating tumor DNA from blood plasma.', 'Ultrasensitive label-free electrochemiluminescence immunosensor based on N-(4-aminobutyl)-N-ethylisoluminol-functionalized graphene composite.', 'Nanomaterial-based biosensors for detection of prostate specific antigen.', 'Diagnosis of prostate cancer via nanotechnological approach.']"""

Since 1997, its involvement in tumor suppression has smoothly increased, up to the current importance. Germline mutations of PTEN cause the PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome (PHTS), which include the past-called Cowden, Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba, Proteus, Proteus-like, and Lhermitte-Duclos syndromes. Somatic mutations of PTEN have been observed in glioblastoma, prostate cancer, and brest cancer cell lines, quoting only the first tissues where the involvement has been proven. The negative regulation of cell interactions with the extracellular matrix could be the way PTEN phosphatase acts as a tumor suppressor. PTEN gene plays an essential role in human development. A recent model sees PTEN function as a stepwise gradation, which can be impaired not only by heterozygous mutations and homozygous losses, but also by other molecular mechanisms, such as transcriptional regression, epigenetic silencing, regulation by microRNAs, posttranslational modification, and aberrant localization. The involvement of PTEN function in melanoma and multistage skin carcinogenesis, with its implication in cancer treatment, and the role of front office in diagnosing PHTS are the main reasons why the dermatologist should know about PTEN.""","""['Corrado Romano', 'Carmelo Schepis']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""ScientificWorldJournal""","""['Cowden syndrome.', 'Association of germline mutation in the PTEN tumour suppressor gene and Proteus and Proteus-like syndromes.', 'PTEN hamartoma tumor syndromes in childhood: description of two cases and a proposal for follow-up protocol.', 'Unexpected cancer-predisposition gene variants in Cowden syndrome and Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome patients without underlying germline PTEN mutations.', 'PTEN: one gene, many syndromes.', 'Crosstalk Between microRNAs and the Pathological Features of Secondary Lymphedema.', 'Aetiology and Pathogenesis of Cutaneous Melanoma: Current Concepts and Advances.', 'Human Schlafen 5 Inhibits Proliferation and Promotes Apoptosis in Lung Adenocarcinoma via the PTEN/PI3K/AKT/mTOR Pathway.', 'Glioblastoma: Pathogenesis and Current Status of Chemotherapy and Other Novel Treatments.', 'Redox Regulation of the Tumor Suppressor PTEN by Hydrogen Peroxide and Tert-Butyl Hydroperoxide.']"""

Experimental design:   c-FLIP expression was characterized by immunohistochemical analysis of prostatectomy tissue. The functional importance of c-FLIP to survival and modulating response to bicalutamide was studied by molecular and pharmacologic interventions.  Results:   c-FLIP expression was increased in high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and prostate cancer tissue relative to normal prostate epithelium (P < 0.001). Maximal c-FLIP expression was detected in castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC; P < 0.001). In vitro, silencing of c-FLIP induced spontaneous apoptosis and increased 22Rv1 and LNCaP cell sensitivity to bicalutamide, determined by flow cytometry, PARP cleavage, and caspase activity assays. The histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi), droxinostat and SAHA, also downregulated c-FLIP expression, induced caspase-8- and caspase-3/7-mediated apoptosis, and increased apoptosis in bicalutamide-treated cells. Conversely, the elevated expression of c-FLIP detected in the CRPC cell line VCaP underpinned their insensitivity to bicalutamide and SAHA in vitro. However, knockdown of c-FLIP induced spontaneous apoptosis in VCaP cells, indicating its relevance to cell survival and therapeutic resistance.  Conclusion:   c-FLIP reduces the efficacy of AR-targeted therapy and maintains the viability of prostate cancer cells. A combination of HDACi with androgen deprivation therapy may be effective in early-stage disease, using c-FLIP expression as a predictive biomarker of sensitivity. Direct targeting of c-FLIP, however, may be relevant to enhance the response of existing and novel therapeutics in CRPC.""","""['Clare McCourt', 'Pamela Maxwell', 'Roberta Mazzucchelli', 'Rodolfo Montironi', 'Marina Scarpelli', 'Manuel Salto-Tellez', ""Joe M O'Sullivan"", 'Daniel B Longley', 'David J J Waugh']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Clin Cancer Res""","""['Cytoplasmic FLIP(S) and nuclear FLIP(L) mediate resistance of castrate-resistant prostate cancer to apoptosis induced by IAP antagonists.', 'Nutlin-3 inhibits androgen receptor-driven c-FLIP expression, resulting in apoptosis of prostate cancer cells.', 'Interleukin-8 signaling attenuates TRAIL- and chemotherapy-induced apoptosis through transcriptional regulation of c-FLIP in prostate cancer cells.', 'c-FLIP, a master anti-apoptotic regulator.', 'FLIP-ping out: death receptor signaling in the prostate.', 'Attenuating Adaptive VEGF-A and IL8 Signaling Restores Durable Tumor Control in AR Antagonist-Treated Prostate Cancers.', 'Interaction between the Hepatitis B Virus and Cellular FLIP Variants in Viral Replication and the Innate Immune System.', 'Estrogen Receptors-Mediated Apoptosis in Hormone-Dependent Cancers.', 'Non-apoptotic function of caspase-8 confers prostate cancer enzalutamide resistance via NF-κB activation.', 'Cut-like homeobox 1 (CUX1) tumor suppressor gene haploinsufficiency induces apoptosis evasion to sustain myeloid leukemia.']"""

We conducted an analysis of serum 25(OH)D and risk of bladder cancer in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Study and examined whether serum vitamin D binding protein (DBP) concentration confounded or modified the association.  Methods:   Three hundred and seventy-five cases of bladder cancer were matched 1:1 with controls based on age (±5 years), race, sex, and date of blood collection (±30 days). Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate ORs and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of bladder cancer by prediagnosis levels of 25(OH)D.  Results:   We found no strong or statistically significant association between serum 25(OH)D and bladder cancer risk (Q1 vs. Q4: OR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.52-1.36; P(trend) = 0.56). Further adjustment for, or stratification by, serum DBP did not alter the findings, nor was there a main effect association between DBP and risk.  Conclusion:   In contrast to an earlier report, we observed no association between vitamin D status and risk of bladder cancer; this difference could be due to the inclusion of women and nonsmokers in the current study population or due to the differences in the distribution of vitamin D concentrations between the two study populations.

Despite the threat that cancer poses to public health in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), few countries in this region have data on cancer incidence. In this paper, we present estimates of cancer incidence in Nigeria based on data from 2 population-based cancer registries (PBCR) that are part of the Nigerian national cancer registry program.  Materials and methods:   We analyzed data from 2 population based cancer registries in Nigeria, the Ibadan Population Based Cancer Registry (IBCR) and the Abuja Population Based Cancer Registry (ABCR) covering a 2 year period 2009-2010. Data are reported by registry, gender and in age groups. We present data on the age specific incidence rates of all invasive cancers and report age standardized rates of the most common cancers stratified by gender in both registries.  Results:   The age standardized incidence rate for all invasive cancers from the IBCR was 66.4 per 100000 men and 130.6 per 100000 women. In ABCR it was 58.3 per 100000 for men and 138.6 per 100000 for women. A total of 3393 cancer cases were reported by the IBCR. Of these cases, 34% (1155) were seen among males and 66% (2238) in females. In Abuja over the same period, 1128 invasive cancers were reported. 33.6% (389) of these cases were in males and 66.4% (768) in females. Mean age of diagnosis of all cancers in men for Ibadan and Abuja were 51.1 and 49.9 years respectively. For women, mean age of diagnosis of all cancers in Ibadan and Abuja were 49.1 and 45.4 respectively. Breast and cervical cancer were the commonest cancers among women and prostate cancer the most common among men. Breast cancer age standardized incidence rate (ASR) at the IBCR was 52.0 per 100000 in IBCR and 64.6 per 100000 in ABCR. Cervical cancer ASR at the IBCR was 36.0 per 100000 and 30.3 per 100000 at the ABCR. The observed differences in incidence rates of breast, cervical and prostate cancer between Ibadan and Abuja, were not statistically significant.  Conclusion:   Cancer incidence data from two population based cancer registries in Nigeria suggests substantial increase in incidence of breast cancer in recent times.

Tumor vascularization is recognized as an important physiological feature likely to impact on both RT and ADT response, and this study therefore aimed to characterize the vascular responses to RT and ADT in experimental PC.  Methods:   Using mice implanted with CWR22 PC xenografts, vascular responses to RT and ADT by castration were visualized in vivo by DCE MRI, before contrast-enhancement curves were analyzed both semi-quantitatively and by pharmacokinetic modeling. Extracted image parameters were correlated to the results from ex vivo quantitative fluorescent immunohistochemical analysis (qIHC) of tumor vascularization (9 F1), perfusion (Hoechst 33342), and hypoxia (pimonidazole), performed on tissue sections made from tumors excised directly after DCE MRI.  Results:   Compared to untreated (Ctrl) tumors, an improved and highly functional vascularization was detected in androgen-deprived (AD) tumors, reflected by increases in DCE MRI parameters and by increased number of vessels (VN), vessel density (VD), and vessel area fraction (VF) from qIHC. Although total hypoxic fractions ( HF) did not change, estimated acute hypoxia scores (AHS)--the proportion of hypoxia staining within 50 μm from perfusion staining--were increased in AD tumors compared to in Ctrl tumors. Five to six months after ADT renewed castration-resistant (CR) tumor growth appeared with an even further enhanced tumor vascularization. Compared to the large vascular changes induced by ADT, RT induced minor vascular changes. Correlating DCE MRI and qIHC parameters unveiled the semi-quantitative parameters area under curve (AUC) from initial time-points to strongly correlate with VD and VF, whereas estimation of vessel size (VS) by DCE MRI required pharmacokinetic modeling. HF was not correlated to any DCE MRI parameter, however, AHS may be estimated after pharmacokinetic modeling. Interestingly, such modeling also detected tumor necrosis very strongly.  Conclusions:   DCE MRI reliably allows non-invasive assessment of tumors' vascular function. The findings of increased tumor vascularization after ADT encourage further studies into whether these changes are beneficial for combined RT, or if treatment with anti-angiogenic therapy may be a strategy to improve the therapeutic efficacy of ADT in advanced PC.""","""['Kathrine Røe', 'Lars Tg Mikalsen', 'Albert J van der Kogel', 'Johan Bussink', 'Heidi Lyng', 'Anne H Ree', 'Laure Marignol', 'Dag R Olsen']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Radiat Oncol""","""['Longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging-based assessment of vascular changes and radiation response in androgen-sensitive prostate carcinoma xenografts under androgen-exposed and androgen-deprived conditions.', 'N-cadherin increases after androgen deprivation and is associated with metastasis in prostate cancer.', 'Liposomal doxorubicin improves radiotherapy response in hypoxic prostate cancer xenografts.', 'Androgen deprivation therapy in combination with radiotherapy for high-risk clinically localized prostate cancer.', 'Castration-recurrent prostate cancer is not androgen-independent.', 'TNF Signaling Is Required for Castration-Induced Vascular Damage Preceding Prostate Cancer Regression.', 'Pre-Treatment Hemoglobin Concentration and Absolute Monocyte Count as Independent Prognostic Factors for Survival in Localized or Locally Advanced Prostate Cancer Patients Undergoing Radiotherapy.', 'Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced MRI of Prostate Lesions of Simultaneous 68GaGa-PSMA-11 PET/MRI: Comparison between Intraprostatic Lesions and Correlation between Perfusion Parameters.', 'Prognostication of anaplastic astrocytoma patients: application of contrast leakage information of dynamic susceptibility contrast-enhanced MRI and dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI.', '4D perfusion CT of prostate cancer for image-guided radiotherapy planning: A proof of concept study.']"""

The goal of this study is to identify the differences between cells that take up plasmid DNA (pDNA) after sonication but are not transfected and cells that similarly take up pDNA but are transfected. We used these findings to select drugs that regulate intracellular processes expected to enhance gene transfection in combination with US.  Materials and methods:   Gene expression among DU145 human prostate cancer cells after ultrasound-mediated transfection was analyzed using Affymetrix GeneChip Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Arrays. Drug treatments suggested by the microarray analysis were combined with US exposure to regulate the corresponding intracellular processes. Cell viability and transfection efficiency were determined by flow cytometry to analyze the effects of US combined with drug treatment.  Results:   Genes such as GADD45α (growth arrest and DNA-damage inducible, alpha) and Topoisomerase IIα were found to be associated with successful transfection. Drugs that regulate GADD45α and Topoisomerase IIα (e.g., ethyl methanesulfomate, amsacrine and chloroquine) were shown to increase ultrasound-mediated transfection efficiency by up to 2 fold.  Conclusions:   Among cells with pDNA uptake after sonication, we found that genes are differentially expressed among transfected cells versus non-transfected cells. Regulation of the expression level of GADD45α and TOP2α and other intracellular processes can yield higher efficiency of ultrasound-mediated gene transfection. This suggests that a strategy to increase gene transfection efficiency involving the combination of sonication and regulation of intracellular processes using drugs could further enhance US-mediated gene transfection.""","""['Ying Liu', 'Nathan J Bowen', 'Lilya Matyunina', 'John McDonald', 'Mark R Prausnitz']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Int J Hyperthermia""","""['Transfection of 9-hydroxyellipticine-resistant Chinese hamster fibroblasts with human topoisomerase IIalpha cDNA: selective restoration of the sensitivity to DNA religation inhibitors.', 'Ultrasound-mediated gene transfection in vitro: effect of ultrasonic parameters on efficiency and cell viability.', 'The correlation between acoustic cavitation and sonoporation involved in ultrasound-mediated DNA transfection with polyethylenimine (PEI) in vitro.', 'Controlled release of cell-permeable gene complex from poly(L-lactide) scaffold for enhanced stem cell tissue engineering.', 'Ultrasound‑targeted microbubbles combined with a peptide nucleic acid binding nuclear localization signal mediate transfection of exogenous genes by improving cytoplasmic and nuclear import.', 'Toward Self-Powered Wearable Adhesive Skin Patch with Bendable Microneedle Array for Transdermal Drug Delivery.']"""

This study addresses novel liposome composition approaches to specifically target tissues overexpressing bombesin (BN) receptors.  Methods:   A new amphiphilic peptide derivative (MonY-BN) containing the BN(7-14) peptide, the DTPA (diethylenetriaminepentaacetate) chelating agent, a hydrophobic moiety with two C(18) alkyl chains, and polyethylene glycol spacers, has been synthesized by solid-phase methods. Liposomes have been generated by co-aggregation of MonY-BN with 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC). The structural and biological properties of these new target-selective drug-delivery systems have been characterized.  Results:   Liposomes with a DSPC/MonY-BN (97/3 molar ratio) composition showed a diameter of 145.5 ± 31.5 nm and a polydispersity index of 0.20 ± 0.05. High doxorubicin (Dox) loading was obtained with the remote pH gradient method using citrate as the inner buffer.

Incubation of cells with DSPC/ MonY-BN/Dox showed significantly lower cell survival compared with DSPC/Dox-treated cells, in the presence of 100 ng/mL and 300 ng/mL drug amounts, in cytotoxicity experiments. Intravenous treatment of PC-3 xenograft-bearing mice with DSPC/MonY-BN/Dox at 10 mg/kg Dox dose produced higher tumour growth inhibition (60%) compared with nonspecific DSPC/ Dox liposomes (36%) relative to control animals.

The cell-penetrating function of a polycationic cell-penetrating peptide (CPP) is efficiently blocked by intramolecular electrostatic interactions with a polyanionic peptide. Proteolysis of a proteinase-sensitive substrate present between the CPP and polyanionic peptide affords dissociation of both domains and enables the activated CPP to enter cells. This ACPP strategy could also be used to modify antitumor agents for tumor-targeting therapy. Here, we aimed to develop a conjugate of ACPP with antitumor drug doxorubicin (DOX) sensitive to matrix metalloproteinase-2 and -9 (MMP-2/9) for tumor-targeting therapy purposes. The ACPP-DOX conjugate was successfully synthesized. Enzymatic cleavage of ACPP-DOX conjugate by matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2/9 indicated that the activation of ACPP-DOX occurred in an enzyme concentration-dependent manner. Flow cytometry and laser confocal microscope studies revealed that the cellular uptake of ACPP-DOX was enhanced after enzymatic-triggered activation and was higher in HT-1080 cells (overexpressed MMPs) than in MCF-7 cells (under-expressed MMPs). The antiproliferative assay showed that ACPP had little toxicity and that ACPP-DOX effectively inhibited HT-1080 cell proliferation. These experiments revealed that the ACPP-DOX conjugate could be triggered by MMP-2/9, which enabled the activated CPP-DOX to enter cells.

The purpose of this study was to develop a novel delivery approach for tumor antigenic peptides in order to elicit enhanced immune responses using poly(DL-lactide-co-glycolide) nanoparticles (PLGA-NPs) encapsulating tumor antigenic peptides. PLGA-NPs were made using the double emulsion-solvent evaporation method. Artificial antigen-presenting cells were generated by human dendritic cells (DCs) loaded with PLGA-NPs encapsulating tumor antigenic peptide(s). The efficiency of the antigen presentation was measured by interferon-γ ELISpot assay (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) were generated and evaluated by CytoTox 96(®) Non-Radioactive Cytotoxicity Assay (Promega, Fitchburg, WI). The efficiency of the peptide delivery was compared between the methods of emulsification in incomplete Freund's adjuvant and encapsulation in PLGA-NPs. Our results showed that most of the PLGA-NPs were from 150 nm to 500 nm in diameter, and were negatively charged at pH 7.4 with a mean zeta potential of -15.53 ± 0.71 mV; the PLGA-NPs could be colocalized in human DCs in 30 minutes of incubation. Human DCs loaded with PLGA-NPs encapsulating peptide induced significantly stronger CTL cytotoxicity than those pulsed with free peptide, while human DCs loaded with PLGA-NPs encapsulating a three-peptide cocktail induced a significantly greater CTL response than those encapsulating a two-peptide cocktail. Most importantly, the peptide dose encapsulated in PLGA-NPs was 63 times less than that emulsified in incomplete Freund's adjuvant, but it induced a more powerful CTL response in vivo. These results demonstrate that the delivery of peptides encapsulated in PLGA-NPs is a promising approach to induce effective antitumor CTL responses in vivo.""","""['Wenxue Ma', 'Mingshui Chen', 'Sharmeela Kaushal', 'Michele McElroy', 'Yu Zhang', 'Cengiz Ozkan', 'Michael Bouvet', 'Carol Kruse', 'Douglas Grotjahn', 'Thomas Ichim', 'Boris Minev']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Int J Nanomedicine""","""['Artificial human antigen-presenting cells are superior to dendritic cells at inducing cytotoxic T-cell responses.', 'Enhanced stimulation of anti-breast cancer T cells responses by dendritic cells loaded with poly lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) nanoparticle encapsulated tumor antigens.', 'Polymer nanoparticles for cross-presentation of exogenous antigens and enhanced cytotoxic T-lymphocyte immune response.', 'Harnessing Dendritic Cells for Poly (D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) Microspheres (PLGA MS)-Mediated Anti-tumor Therapy.', 'Polylactide-co-glycolide nanoparticles for controlled delivery of anticancer agents.', 'Peptide-Based Vaccine against Breast Cancer: Recent Advances and Prospects.', 'Immunoinformatics Approach to Design a Multi-Epitope Nanovaccine against Leishmania Parasite: Elicitation of Cellular Immune Responses.', 'PLGA Particles in Immunotherapy.', 'Development of Foot-and-Mouth Disease Vaccines in Recent Years.', 'Surface Modification of Biodegradable Microparticles with the Novel Host-Derived Immunostimulant CPDI-02 Significantly Increases Short-Term and Long-Term Mucosal and Systemic Antibodies against Encapsulated Protein Antigen in Young Naïve Mice after Respiratory Immunization.']"""

To test this hypothesis, we investigated cirDNA modifications in prostate cancer patients with locally confined disease (n = 19), in patients with benign prostate hyperplasias (n = 20) and in men without any known prostate disease (n = 20). This initial discovery screen identified 39 disease-associated changes in cirDNA modification, and seven of these were validated using the sodium bisulfite-based mapping of modified cytosines in both the discovery cohort and an independent 38-patient validation cohort. In particular, we showed that the DNA modification of regions adjacent to the gene encoding ring finger protein 219 distinguished prostate cancer from benign hyperplasias with good sensitivity (61%) and specificity (71%). We also showed that repetitive sequences detected in this study were meaningful, as they indicated a highly statistically significant loss of DNA at the pericentromeric region of chromosome 10 in prostate cancer patients (p = 1.8 × 10(-6)). Based on these strong univariate results, we applied machine-learning techniques to develop a multi-locus biomarker that correctly distinguished prostate cancer samples from unaffected controls with 72% accuracy. Lastly, we used systems biology techniques to integrate our data with publicly available DNA modification and transcriptomic data from primary prostate tumors, thereby prioritizing genes for further studies.

However, the mechanisms regulating Mst1 remain obscure. Here, we characterized the effects of phospho-Thr-120 on Mst1 in prostate cancer cells. We demonstrated that phospho-Thr-120 did not alter the nuclear localization or cleavage of Mst1 in a LNCaP or castration-resistant C4-2 prostate tumor cell model, as revealed by a mutagenesis approach. Phospho-Thr-120 appeared to be specific to cancer cells and predominantly localized in the nucleus. In contrast, phospho-Thr-183, a critical regulator of Mst1 cell death, was exclusively found in the cytoplasm. As assessed by immunohistochemistry, a similar distribution of phospho-Mst1-Thr-120/Thr-183 was also observed in a prostate cancer specimen. In addition, the blockade of PI3K signaling by a small molecule inhibitor, LY294002, increased cytoplasmic phospho-Mst1-Thr-183 without having a significant effect on nuclear phospho-Mst1-Thr-120. However, the attenuation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activity by a selective pharmacologic inhibitor, Ku0063794 or CCI-779, caused the up-regulation of nuclear phospho-Mst1-Thr-120 without affecting cytoplasmic phospho-Mst1-Thr-183. This suggests that PI3K and mTOR pathway signaling differentially regulate phospho-Mst1-Thr-120/Thr-183. Moreover, mutagenesis and RNAi data revealed that phospho-Thr-120 resulted in C4-2 cell resistance to mTOR inhibition and reduced the Mst1 suppression of cell growth and androgen receptor-driven gene expression.

The methods proposed by Bray and Parkin, and Parkin and Bray (Eur J Cancer 2009;45:747-64) were applied to the registry data from 1990 to 2009 to assess comparability, validity and completeness. The system used for classification and coding of neoplasms followed international standards. The percentage of cases morphologically verified was 18.1% for men and 33.1% for women, and that of death certificate only cases was 6.6 and 3.6%, respectively. Incidence rates in rural regions were lower than in the urban part of the country, except amongst young male adults. Comparison with other West African registries showed that the incidences of liver and uterine cervical cancer were comparable, but those of prostate and breast in The Gambia were relatively low.

However to date, none of these definitions have been validated for this use. We have reviewed several definitions of BF to determine their accuracy in predicting biopsy-proven local recurrence following prostate cryoablation.  Methods:   The Columbia University Urologic Oncology Database was queried for patients who underwent prostate cryoablation between 1994 and 2010, and who subsequently underwent surveillance biopsy due to clinical suspicion of prostate cancer recurrence. Serial postoperative prostate-specific antigen (PSA) results were used to determine BF according to various definitions of BF. Biopsy results were used to determine local recurrence. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve area were calculated for each of the BF definitions.  Results:   A total of 110 patients met inclusion criteria for the study. These patients were treated with primary full-gland (n = 38), primary focal (n = 24), or salvage cryoablation (n = 48). On surveillance biopsy, 66 patients (60%) were found to have locally recurrent prostate cancer. The most accurate BF definition overall was PSA nadir plus 2 ng/ml (Phoenix definition), with sensitivity, specificity, and ROC curve area of 68%, 59%, and 0.64, respectively.  Conclusions:   Overall, the Phoenix definition best predicted local cancer recurrence following prostate cryoablation. These preliminary data may be useful for researchers evaluating the short-term efficacy of cryoablation, and for urologists assessing their patients for potential cancer recurrence.""","""['Max Pitman', 'Edan Y Shapiro', 'Gregory W Hruby', 'Matthew D Truesdale', 'Philippa J Cheetham', 'Shumaila Saad', 'Aaron E Katz']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Unification of a common biochemical failure definition for prostate cancer treated with brachytherapy or external beam radiotherapy with or without androgen deprivation.', 'Predictors of prostate-specific antigen biochemical recurrence in patients undergoing primary whole-gland prostate cryoablation.', 'Definitions of biochemical failure that best predict clinical failure in patients with prostate cancer treated with external beam radiation alone: a multi-institutional pooled analysis.', 'Variation in the definition of biochemical recurrence in patients treated for localized prostate cancer: the American Urological Association Prostate Guidelines for Localized Prostate Cancer Update Panel report and recommendations for a standard in the reporting of surgical outcomes.', 'Salvage cryoablation for locally recurrent prostate cancer following primary radiotherapy.', ""Defeating Cancers' Adaptive Defensive Strategies Using Thermal Therapies: Examining Cancer's Therapeutic Resistance, Ablative, and Computational Modeling Strategies as a means for Improving Therapeutic Outcome."", 'Enhanced killing of HepG2 during cryosurgery with Fe3O4-nanoparticle improved intracellular ice formation and cell dehydration.', 'Percutaneous MR-guided focal cryoablation for recurrent prostate cancer following radiation therapy: retrospective analysis of iceball margins and outcomes.', 'Fe3O4 nanoparticles and cryoablation enhance ice crystal formation to improve the efficiency of killing breast cancer cells.', 'Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging of Recurrent Prostate Cancer.']"""

Methods:   Linked census-cancer registration data were used to calculate age-standardized cancer incidence rates for Pacific people. Both trends over time within Pacific people and differences in rates between Pacific and European/Other people in New Zealand were assessed.  Results:   Pacific rates were higher for cancers of the cervix, endometrium, gallbladder, lip, mouth and pharynx, liver, lung, ovary, pancreas, stomach, and thyroid, and lower for colorectal, bladder, and testicular cancers and melanoma. Differences were large, ranging from a 90 % lower rate of melanoma to over seven times higher rate of liver cancer compared to European/Other. Breast and prostate cancers were the commonest malignancies for Pacific women and men, respectively. Important changes for Pacific women over time include a 64 % decrease in cervical cancer incidence (ptrend = 0.02) and a 245 % increase for lung cancer (ptrend = 0.02), while men had a 366 % increase in prostate cancer (ptrend = 0.02).  Conclusions:   Pacific people in New Zealand have a disproportionate cancer burden related to infectious diseases such as HPV and Hepatitis B. However, with escalating evidence for causal associations between diabetes, obesity, and physical inactivity with various cancers, the challenge will be to prevent these cancers from rising in Pacific people who have the highest rates of these conditions in New Zealand. Disparities for tobacco-related cancers support tobacco consumption as another important cause of cancer incidence disparity.

However, the quality of such CBCTs is degraded by megavoltage (MV) scatter from the treatment beam onto the imaging panel. The objective of this paper is to introduce a novel MV scatter correction method for simultaneous CBCT during VMAT, and to investigate its effectiveness when compared to other techniques. The correction requires the acquisition of a separate set of images taken during VMAT delivery, while the kV beam is off. These images--which contain only the MV scatter contribution on the imaging panel--are then used to correct the corresponding kV/MV projections. To test this method, CBCTs were taken of an image quality phantom during VMAT delivery and measurements of contrast to noise ratio were made. Additionally, the correction was applied to the datasets of three VMAT prostate patients, who also received simultaneous CBCTs. The clinical image quality was assessed using a validated scoring system, comparing standard CBCTs to the uncorrected simultaneous CBCTs and a variety of correction methods. Results show that the correction is able to recover some of the low and high-contrast signal to noise ratio lost due to MV scatter. From the patient study, the corrected CBCT scored significantly higher than the uncorrected images in terms of the ability to identify the boundary between the prostate and surrounding soft tissue. In summary, a simple MV scatter correction method has been developed and, using both phantom and patient data, is shown to improve the image quality of simultaneous CBCTs taken during VMAT delivery.""","""['C J Boylan', 'T E Marchant', 'J Stratford', 'J Malik', 'A Choudhury', 'R Shrimali', 'J Rodgers', 'C G Rowbottom']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['A novel method for megavoltage scatter correction in cone-beam CT acquired concurrent with rotational irradiation.', 'A moving blocker-based strategy for simultaneous megavoltage and kilovoltage scatter correction in cone-beam computed tomography image acquired during volumetric modulated arc therapy.', 'Acquisition of MV-scatter-free kilovoltage CBCT images during RapidArc™ or VMAT.', 'Evaluating the image quality of cone beam CT acquired during rotational delivery.', 'Application of 4-D medical imaging in radiation therapy of tumors.', 'Effect of scattered megavoltage x-rays on markerless tumor tracking using dual energy kilovoltage imaging.', 'Concurrent kilovoltage CBCT imaging and megavoltage beam delivery: suppression of cross-scatter with 2D antiscatter grids and grid-based scatter sampling.', 'Megavoltage cross-scatter rejection and correction using 2D antiscatter grids in kilovoltage CBCT imaging.', 'Quantification and correction of the scattered X-rays from a megavoltage photon beam to a linac-mounted kilovoltage imaging subsystem.', 'Image quality evaluation of intra-irradiation cone-beam computed tomography acquired during one- and two-arc prostate volumetric-modulated arc therapy delivery: A phantom study.']"""

However, the role of these proteins in prostate cancer is poorly understood. We immunohistochemically stained for semenogelins I and II and eppin in 291 radical prostatectomy specimens. We then evaluated the association between their expressions in nuclei, cytoplasms, or intraluminal secretions of benign/high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia/carcinoma cells and clinicopathologic profile available for our patient cohort. Stains were positive in 32%/77%/84% (nuclear semenogelin I), 87%/94%/84% (nuclear semenogelin II), 56%/64%/37% (nuclear eppin), 7%/15%/11% (cytoplasmic semenogelin I), 6%/11%/9% (cytoplasmic semenogelin II), 68%/74%/95% (cytoplasmic eppin), 97%/98%/13% (secreted semenogelin I), 98%/97%/11% (secreted semenogelin II), and 97%/98%/48% (secreted eppin) of benign/prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia/carcinoma, respectively. The levels of nuclear semenogelin I/cytoplasmic eppin were significantly higher in carcinoma than in benign (P<.001/P<.001) or prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (P<.001/P<.001) and in prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia than in benign (P<.001/P=.006). Significantly higher nuclear semenogelin II expression was found in prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia than in benign (P<.001) or carcinoma (P<.001). Significantly lower nuclear eppin expression was seen in carcinoma than in benign (P<.001) or prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (P<.001). Secreted semenogelin I, secreted semenogelin II, and secreted eppin were all significantly lower in carcinoma than in benign (P<.001) or prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (P<.001). There were no statistically significant correlations between each stain and clinicopathologic features except significantly lower nuclear eppin expression in Gleason score 8 or higher tumors. Kaplan-Meier and log-rank tests further revealed that patients with nuclear semenogelin I-positive tumor had a significantly higher risk for biochemical recurrence (P=.046). Multivariate Cox model showed a trend toward significance (P=.093) in nuclear semenogelin I positivity as an independent predictor for recurrence.

Aims:   We assessed the relationships between RP and quality of life (QOL) according to the preoperative SD.  Main outcome measure:   General QOL was measured with Short Form 36. Sexual function and bother were measured with the University of California, Los Angeles Prostate Cancer Index (PCI). Changes of postoperative SD were also evaluated using PCI.  Methods:   We analyzed data from 285 men who underwent RP and were prospectively enrolled into a longitudinal cohort study. Patients were divided into two groups according to whether they had SD at baseline, which is addressed in the PCI questionnaire: a low SD (LSD) group and a high SD (HSD) group. The assessments were completed before treatment and 3, 6, 12, 24, and 60 months after RP.  Results:   Of the 244 men, 52% had high or a fair level of SD before RP, whereas 48% reported that the level of their SD was low. The HSD group reported better sexual function and sexual bother scores than the LSD group at baseline (both P < 0.001). Fifty-one percent of the HSD group reported that SD at 3 months was poor or very poor, which did not return to the preoperative level at all postoperative time points. Nearly 20% of the LSD group regained higher SD after RP than the baseline level. The HSD group showed worse sexual bother scores than the baseline throughout the postoperative follow-up (P < 0.001). However, the LSD group demonstrated equivalent sexual bother scores after RP compared with the baseline.  Conclusions:   RP adversely affected SD as well as sexual function and sexual bother.

To accomplish a more precise estimation of the relationship, a meta-analysis was performed.  Methodology/principal findings:   We assessed published studies of the association between caspase 9 polymorphisms and cancer risk from nine studies with 5,528 subjects for rs4645978, six studies with 2,403 subjects for rs105276 and two studies for rs4645981.

Although the associations of the XMRV infection with human diseases appear unlikely, the XMRV is a retrovirus of undefined pathogenic potential, able to replicate in human cells in vitro. Since recent studies using animal models for infection have yielded conflicting results, we set out an ex vivo model for XMRV infection of human tonsillar tissue to determine whether XMRV produced by 22Rv1 cells is able to replicate in human lymphoid organs. Tonsil blocks were infected and infection kinetics and its pathogenic effects were monitored  Results:   XMRV, though restricted by APOBEC, enters and integrates into the tissue cells. The infection did not result in changes of T or B-cells, immune activation, nor inflammatory chemokines. Infectious viruses could be recovered from supernatants of infected tonsils by reinfecting DERSE XMRV indicator cell line, although these supernatants could not establish a new infection in fresh tonsil culture, indicating that in our model, the viral replication is controlled by innate antiviral restriction factors.  Conclusions:   Overall, the replication-competent retrovirus XMRV, present in a high number of laboratories, is able to infect human lymphoid tissue and produce infectious viruses, even though they were unable to establish a new infection in fresh tonsillar tissue.

To find prostate cancer (PCa) diagnostic biomarkers that can make up for the defects of PSA, we compared the secretomes of several benign and PCa cell lines, selected candidate molecules, and then confirmed their clinical value.  Methodology/principal findings:   We first identified extracellular proteins by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) coupled with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) identification. We then validated the secreted proteins on a cellular level, and finally determined whether they could be used as PCa diagnostic biomarkers using prostate tissue and serum specimens of Chinese volunteers by immunohistostaining and sandwich ELISA. We obtained credible extracellular protein 2-DE graphs of prostate cell lines. The 5 spots that showed superior repeatability were selected for LC-MS/MS analysis, which identified seven candidate molecules. One of the candidate molecules, spondin-2 (SPON2), was only expressed in the conditioned media (CM) of androgen receptor (AR) positive PCa cell lines. Using tissue microarray by immunohistostaining, we found SPON2 to be over-expressed in PCa. SPON2 staining was more intense in Gleason score sum 7-8 and in PCa patients with metastasis. By receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, we found that the serum SPON2 level was elevated in PCa patients, showing sensitivity and specificity suitable for diagnostic use.

Its association with CFS is now largely discredited, and current results support a laboratory origin for XMRV with no reproducible evidence for infection of humans. However, some results indicating the presence of XMRV in prostate cancer are difficult to attribute to sample contamination. Here we have sought biological evidence that might confirm the presence of XMRV in prostate cancer samples previously having tested positive.  Methods and results:   We have tested for infectious XMRV and neutralizing antibodies against XMRV in blood plasma from 29 subjects with prostate cancer, and for infectious XMRV in prostate secretions from another five prostate cancer subjects. Nine of these subjects had previously tested positive for XMRV by PCR or by virus assay. We did not detect XMRV or related retroviruses in any sample, and the neutralizing activities of the plasma samples were all very low, a result inconsistent with XMRV infection of the plasma donors.  Conclusions:   We find no evidence for XMRV infection of any human subject tested, either by assay for infectious virus or for neutralizing antibodies. Our results are consistent with the majority of published studies on XMRV, which find that XMRV is not present in humans.

These cells were established from a human prostate tumor, CWR22, that was serially passaged in nude mice and selected for androgen independence. The 22Rv1 cells are known to produce high titers of xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus (XMRV). Recent studies suggested that XMRV was inadvertently created in the 1990's when two murine leukemia virus (MLV) genomes (pre-XMRV1 and pre-XMRV-2) recombined during passaging of the CWR22 tumor in mice. The conclusion that XMRV originated from mice and not the patient was based partly on the failure to detect XMRV in early CWR22 xenografts. While that deduction is certainly justified, we examined the possibility that a closely related virus could have been present in primary tumor tissue. Here we report that we have located the original prostate tumor tissue excised from patient CWR22 and have assayed the corresponding DNA by PCR and the tissue sections by fluorescence in situ hybridization for the presence of XMRV or a similar virus. The primary tumor tissues lacked mouse DNA as determined by PCR for intracisternal A type particle DNA, thus avoiding one of the limitations of studying xenografts.

Glutamine is converted to glutamate by GLS, entering the tricarboxylic acid cycle as an important energy source. Less well-recognized, glutamate can also be converted to proline through Δ(1)-pyrroline-5-carboxylate (P5C) and vice versa. This study suggests that some MYC-induced cellular effects are due to MYC regulation of proline metabolism. Proline oxidase, also known as proline dehydrogenase (POX/PRODH), the first enzyme in proline catabolism, is a mitochondrial tumor suppressor that inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis. MiR-23b* mediates POX/PRODH down-regulation in human kidney tumors. MiR-23b* is processed from the same transcript as miR-23b; the latter inhibits the translation of GLS. Using MYC-inducible human Burkitt lymphoma model P493 and PC3 human prostate cancer cells, we showed that MYC suppressed POX/PRODH expression primarily through up-regulating miR-23b*. The growth inhibition in the absence of MYC was partially reversed by POX/PRODH knockdown, indicating the importance of suppression of POX/PRODH in MYC-mediated cellular effects. Interestingly, MYC not only inhibited POX/PRODH, but also markedly increased the enzymes of proline biosynthesis from glutamine, including P5C synthase and P5C reductase 1. MYC-induced proline biosynthesis from glutamine was directly confirmed using (13)C,(15)N-glutamine as a tracer. The metabolic link between glutamine and proline afforded by MYC emphasizes the complexity of tumor metabolism. Further studies of the relationship between glutamine and proline metabolism should provide a deeper understanding of tumor metabolism while enabling the development of novel therapeutic strategies.""","""['Wei Liu', 'Anne Le', 'Chad Hancock', 'Andrew N Lane', 'Chi V Dang', 'Teresa W-M Fan', 'James M Phang']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A""","""['Proline dehydrogenase (oxidase) in cancer.', 'Prolidase-proline dehydrogenase/proline oxidase-collagen biosynthesis axis as a potential interface of apoptosis/autophagy.', 'Collagen metabolism as a regulator of proline dehydrogenase/proline oxidase-dependent apoptosis/autophagy.', 'Oncogenic human herpesvirus hijacks proline metabolism for tumorigenesis.', 'Unraveling delta1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate-proline cycle in plants by uncoupled expression of proline oxidation enzymes.', 'Decoding Metabolic Symbiosis between Pancreatic Cancer Cells and Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts Using Cultured Tumor Microenvironment.', 'Amino Acid Metabolism in Bone Metastatic Disease.', 'PI3K/ c-Myc/AFF4 axis promotes pancreatic tumorigenesis through fueling nucleotide metabolism.', 'Targeting Mitochondria with ClpP Agonists as a Novel Therapeutic Opportunity in Breast Cancer.', 'PYCR1 promotes the malignant progression of lung cancer through the JAK-STAT3 signaling pathway via PRODH-dependent glutamine synthesize.']"""

Methods:   A modified 2-round Delphi technique was used, which was composed of 7 clinical experts. The first round was performed through telephone interviews with individual clinical experts to assess the management of patients with bone metastases receiving IV zoledronic acid and pamidronate. The interviews focused on qualitative issues, such as drugs administered, cancers identified, and the method of drug administration. The information obtained from the first round was used to describe typical patient management patterns. The information obtained from the second round was done by a face-to-face meeting involving all expert members, with the aim of confirming the management patterns, and identifying commonality and uniqueness across institutions. The time and health care resources needed for preparation and administration of the IV bisphosphonates were estimated.  Results:   The expert panel comprised 4 pharmacists and 3 nurses from 2 centers in Ontario and 3 centers in Quebec. The main stages identified, which were associated with the preparation and administration of pamidronate and zoledronic acid, included preinfusion activities, IV access set-up, IV bisphosphonate preparation, chemotherapy infusion (if applicable), IV bisphosphonate infusion, and postinfusion activities. Five patient management patterns were identified and varied with respect to inclusion of chemotherapy and the use of ambulatory infusion devices. Without chemotherapy, the mean time for preparation and administration of zoledronic acid ranged from 38 minutes in a community service center to 85 minutes in a hospital-based cancer center. With chemotherapy, the total mean time increased to 119 minutes for patients with prostate cancer and 173 minutes for patients with breast cancer. The mean time for preparation and administration of pamidronate was 159 minutes with the use of a regular infusion device, and the time in the clinic was only 14 minutes with the use of an ambulatory infusion device. If chemotherapy was scheduled on the same visits, the mean time increased substantially, and varied depending on the type of cancer being treated.  Conclusion:   Preparation and administration of IV bisphosphonates are associated with notable burden to health care providers and patients, even if the waiting time, including preinfusion (eg, IV access set-up, serum creatinine level monitoring) and postinfusion activities, were excluded. Variations in the time and health care resources utilized for preparing and administering IV bisphosphonates were observed across the centers in Canada.

Methods:   In order to identify the susceptible locus (loci) for prostate cancer in African Americans, we have performed linkage analyses on members of 15 large high-risk families. Specifically, these families were recruited from Louisiana and represent a uniquely admixed African American population exclusive to Southern Louisiana. In addition to geographical constraints, these families were clinically homogeneous creating a well-characterized collection of large pedigrees.

Methods:   Between July 2005 and May 2007, the Reach Out to Enhance Wellness (RENEW) trial accrued 641 locoregionally staged, long-term (≥ 5 years from diagnosis) colorectal, breast, and prostate cancer survivors in the United States (21 states), Canada, and the United Kingdom. All participants were sedentary (< 150 minutes of physical activity [PA] a week), overweight or obese (body mass index, 25 to 40 kg/m(2)), and over age 65 years. The trial tested a diet-exercise intervention delivered via mailed print materials and telephone counseling. RENEW used a wait-list control, cross-over design (ie, participants received the year-long intervention immediately or after a 1-year delay), which allowed the opportunity to assess program efficacy (previously reported primary outcome), durability, and reproducibility (reported herein). Measures included diet quality (DQ), PA, BMI, and physical function (PF).  Results:   No significant relapse was observed in the immediate-intervention arm for DQ, PA, and BMI; however, rates of functional decline increased when the intervention ceased. From year 1 to year 2, significant improvements were observed in the delayed-intervention arm; mean change scores in behaviors and BMI and PF slopes were as follows: DQ score, 5.2 (95% CI, 3.4 to 7.0); PA, 45.8 min/wk (95% CI, 26.9 to 64.6 min/wk); BMI, -0.56 (95% CI, -0.75 to -0.36); and Short Form-36 PF, -1.02 versus -5.52 (P < .001 for all measures). Overall, both arms experienced significant improvements in DQ, PA, and BMI from baseline to 2-year follow-up (P < .001).

Med. Biol. 50 5893-908). PCA determines the most important geometric variability in terms of eigenmodes, which represent 3D vector fields of correlated organ deformations around the mean geometry. Weighted sums of a few dominating eigenmodes can be used to simulate synthetic geometries, which are statistically meaningful inter- and extrapolations of the input geometries, and predict their probability of occurrence. We present the use of PCA as a versatile treatment simulation tool, which allows comprehensive dosimetric assessment of the detrimental effects that deformable geometric uncertainties can have on a planned dose distribution. For this, a set of random synthetic geometries is generated by a PCA model for each simulated treatment course, and the dose of a given treatment plan is accumulated in the moving tissue elements via dose warping. This enables the calculation of average voxel doses, local dose variability, dose-volume histogram uncertainties, marginal as well as joint probability distributions of organ equivalent uniform doses and thus of TCP and NTCP, and other dosimetric and biologic endpoints.

We used MC3T3-E1 cells, a mouse osteoblast cell line, LM8, a mouse osteosarcoma cell line, SaOS2, a human osteosarcoma cell line, 786-O, a human renal cancer cell line, PC-3, a human prostate cancer cell line, and A549, a human lung cancer cell line. The expression of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2), Akt, β-catenin, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and cell migration were analyzed. LIPUS stimulation did not affect proliferation of all the cells examined. The phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and Akt was induced by LIPUS stimulation in MC3T3-E1, LM8, SaOS2 and A549 cells, but not in PC-3 and 786-O cells. LIPUS stimulation did not significantly increase β-catenin. VEGF protein levels and cell migration were significantly increased only in MC3T3-E1 cells. It may be concluded that LIPUS stimulation on metastatic bone tumors induces differentiation of osteoblasts without proliferation of tumor cells. Our study suggests that LIPUS may be a new method of treatment without surgery for metastatic bone tumors.""","""['Yasushi Sawai', 'Hiroaki Murata', 'Kazutaka Koto', 'Takaaki Matsui', 'Naoyuki Horie', 'Eishi Ashihara', 'Taira Maekawa', 'Shinji Fushiki', 'Toshikazu Kubo']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Oncol Rep""","""['Osteocytes exposed to far field of therapeutic ultrasound promotes osteogenic cellular activities in pre-osteoblasts through soluble factors.', 'Effects of low-intensity pulsed ultrasound on the differentiation of C2C12 cells.', 'Osteogenic differentiation of rat bone marrow stromal cells by various intensities of low-intensity pulsed ultrasound.', 'Comparison of the in\xa0vitro effects of low-level laser therapy and low-intensity pulsed ultrasound therapy on bony cells and stem cells.', 'Developmental pathways hijacked by osteosarcoma.', 'Low-intensity pulsed ultrasound inhibits fibroblast-like synoviocyte proliferation and reduces synovial fibrosis by regulating Wnt/β-catenin signaling.', 'Low-Intensity Continuous Ultrasound Therapies—A Systematic Review of Current State-of-the-Art and Future Perspectives.', 'Adjuvant Biophysical Therapies in Osteosarcoma.', 'Inhibitory effects of low intensity pulsed ultrasound on osteoclastogenesis induced in vitro by breast cancer cells.', 'Low-intensity pulsed ultrasound in combination with SonoVue induces cytotoxicity of human renal glomerular endothelial cells via repression of the ERK1/2 signaling pathway.']"""

One proposed mechanism to account for androgen receptor (AR) activity in the castrate environment is via crosstalk with other signaling pathways. Specifically, reciprocal interactions between the AKT/mTOR and AR pathways have been implicated in prostate cancer progression. Here, we used the potent inhibitor ridaforolimus to target mTOR signaling alone and in combination with AR blockade by bicalutamide to examine the effect of abrogating these signaling pathways. Ridaforolimus treatment inhibited the proliferation of all six prostate cancer cell lines examined with the greatest sensitivity associated with loss of PTEN and elevated AKT/mTOR pathway activity. Dual inhibition of the AR and mTOR signaling pathways provided further benefit with the ridaforolimus-bicalutamide combination producing synergistic antiproliferative effects in prostate cancer cells in vitro when compared with each agent alone. Pharmacodynamic analysis confirmed that combination treatment resulted in full inhibition of each of the respective pathways. Importantly, the ridaforolimus-bicalutamide combination exhibited potent antitumor activity with parallel reductions in plasma PSA levels in vivo. Taken together, ridaforolimus exhibited potent antiproliferative and antitumor activity in prostate cancer models and the addition of bicalutamide represents a potentially effective combination strategy for patient therapy.""","""['Rachel M Squillace', 'David Miller', 'Scott D Wardwell', 'Frank Wang', 'Tim Clackson', 'Victor M Rivera']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Int J Oncol""","""['Prolonging hormone sensitivity in prostate cancer xenografts through dual inhibition of AR and mTOR.', 'The androgen receptor is a negative regulator of eIF4E phosphorylation at S209: implications for the use of mTOR inhibitors in advanced prostate cancer.', 'Tolerability, safety and pharmacokinetics of ridaforolimus in combination with bicalutamide in patients with asymptomatic, metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).', 'Role of PI3K-AKT-mTOR Pathway as a Pro-Survival Signaling and Resistance-Mediating Mechanism to Therapy of Prostate Cancer.', 'Addressing the Reciprocal Crosstalk between the AR and the PI3K/AKT/mTOR Signaling Pathways for Prostate Cancer Treatment.', 'A Systematic Comparison of Antiandrogens Identifies Androgen Receptor Protein Stability as an Indicator for Treatment Response.', 'Inhibitors of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR Pathway in Prostate Cancer Chemoprevention and Intervention.', 'Hydralazine and Enzalutamide: Synergistic Partners against Prostate Cancer.', 'Highly Conserved Homotrimer Cavity Formed by the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Glycoprotein: A Novel Binding Site.', 'Diagnostic Value of 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT for Detection of Phosphatase and Tensin Homolog Expression in Prostate Cancer: A Pilot Study.']"""

Both are higher in developed countries. Some attribute this to westernized lifestyles of high-energy diets and limited physical activity with consequent obesity. Obesity and obesity-related diseases like diabetes cause hyperinsulinaemia, which upregulates pro-survival cell signalling. Previous work revealed diet-induced hyperinsulinaemia enhances prostate cancer xenograft growth in vivo. Metformin, an antidiabetic medication, reduces hyperinsulinaemia and also exhibits antineoplastic properties. Herein, we assess the potential additive benefit of combining bicalutamide antiandrogen therapy with metformin, in vitro and in vivo.  Methods:   Using clonogenic assays, we assessed the effect of bicalutamide and/or metformin on clonogenicity in prostate cancer cell lines. Western blot and cell cycle analyses were used to elucidate mechanisms of interaction between the drugs in androgen receptor (AR)-positive (LNCaP) and AR-negative (PC3) cell lines. The combination treatment regimen was assessed in vivo using an LNCaP murine xenograft model.  Results:   Micromolar bicalutamide or millimolar metformin caused a significant dose-dependent reduction in clonogenicity (P<0.001). Combination treatment further significantly reduced clonogenicity (P<0.005) with greater effects in AR-positive cells. Western blot and cell cycle analyses suggested differing mechanisms of interaction in AR-positive and -negative cell lines. Following combination treatment, LNCaP cells exhibited an altered cell proliferation (decreased phospho mammalian target of rapamycin expression) and perturbed cell cycle kinetics (G1/S cell cycle arrest). PC3 cells showed evidence of enhanced apoptosis (increased Bcl-2-associated X protein and decreased total caspase 3 expression). Markedly diminished tumour growth occurred following combination treatment in vivo (P<0.001).  Conclusions:   Combining bicalutamide and metformin significantly reduces prostate cancer cell growth further than either monotherapy. In AR-positive cells, this effect appeared to be mediated by reducing proliferation rates, whereas in AR-negative cells the combination treatment appeared to promote apoptosis. This combination drug regimen may improve prostate-cancer-specific survival by the direct antineoplastic properties outlined.""","""['A J Colquhoun', 'N A Venier', 'A D Vandersluis', 'R Besla', 'L M Sugar', 'A Kiss', 'N E Fleshner', 'M Pollak', 'L H Klotz', 'V Venkateswaran']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['5-Azacitidine restores and amplifies the bicalutamide response on preclinical models of androgen receptor expressing or deficient prostate tumors.', 'Carbidopa enhances antitumoral activity of bicalutamide on the androgen receptor-axis in castration-resistant prostate tumors.', 'Antagonistic interaction between bicalutamide (Casodex) and radiation in androgen-positive prostate cancer LNCaP cells.', 'Maximal androgen blockade for advanced prostate cancer.', 'A review for clinicians: Prostate cancer and the antineoplastic properties of metformin.', 'Systematic review of antitumour efficacy and mechanism of metformin activity in prostate cancer models.', 'Metformin regulates multiple signaling pathways within castration-resistant human prostate cancer cells.', 'Salmon Protein Hydrolysate Potentiates the Growth Inhibitory Effect of Bicalutamide on Human Prostate Cancer Cell Lines LNCaP and PC3 by Modulating Iron Homeostasis.', 'Metformin and Cancer Hallmarks: Molecular Mechanisms in Thyroid, Prostate and Head and Neck Cancer Models.', 'Metformin and Androgen Receptor-Axis-Targeted (ARAT) Agents Induce Two PARP-1-Dependent Cell Death Pathways in Androgen-Sensitive Human Prostate Cancer Cells.']"""

Despite significant advances in prostate cancer diagnosis and management, the molecular events involved in the transformation of normal prostate cells into cancer cells have not been fully understood. It is generally accepted that prostate cancer derives from the basal compartment while expressing luminal markers. We investigated whether downregulation of the basal protein B-cell translocation gene 2 (BTG2) is implicated in prostate cancer transformation and progression. Here we show that BTG2 loss can shift normal prostate basal cells towards luminal markers expression, a phenotype also accompanied by the appearance of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) traits. We also show that the overexpression of microRNA (miR)-21 suppresses BTG2 levels and promotes the acquisition of luminal markers and EMT in prostate cells. Furthermore, by using an innovative lentiviral vector able to compete with endogenous mRNA through the overexpression of the 3'-untranslated region of BTG2, we demonstrate that in prostate tumor cells, the levels of luminal and EMT markers can be reduced by derepression of BTG2 from microRNA-mediated control. Finally, we show that the loss of BTG2 expression confers to non-tumorigenic prostate cells ability to grow in an orthotopic murine model, thus demonstrating the central role of BTG2 downregulaton in prostate cancer biology.""","""['V Coppola', 'M Musumeci', 'M Patrizii', 'A Cannistraci', 'A Addario', 'M Maugeri-Saccà', 'M Biffoni', 'F Francescangeli', 'M Cordenonsi', 'S Piccolo', 'L Memeo', 'A Pagliuca', 'G Muto', 'A Zeuner', 'R De Maria', 'D Bonci']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['Androgen-regulated miR-32 targets BTG2 and is overexpressed in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'The relationship between microRNA-18 and BTG2 in the carcinogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'Regulation of the cell cycle gene, BTG2, by miR-21 in human laryngeal carcinoma.', 'BTG2: a rising star of tumor suppressors (review).', 'Tumor suppressors BTG1 and BTG2: Beyond growth control.', 'Expression and methylation status of BTG2, PPP1CA, and PEG3 genes in colon adenocarcinoma cell lines: promising treatment targets.', 'MiR-375 and miR-21 as Potential Biomarkers of Prostate Cancer: Comparison of Matching Samples of Plasma and Exosomes.', 'B-Cell Translocation Gene 2 Upregulation Is Associated with Favorable Prognosis in Lung Adenocarcinoma and Prolonged Patient Survival.', 'BTG2 as a tumor target for the treatment of luminal A breast cancer.', 'BTG2 Serves as a Potential Prognostic Marker and Correlates with Immune Infiltration in Lung Adenocarcinoma.']"""

Rab25 carries a constitutively activating mutation in its GTPase domain. Increased expression of Rab25 has been associated with the aggressiveness of migrating tumor cells. Here, we aimed to elucidate potential differences in the role of those two GTPases in vesicle trafficking during cell migration.  Methods:   We expressed Rab11 and Rab25 wildtype and mutant constructs in HeLa and MDA-MB231 cells and measured their effect on cell morphology, vesicle dynamics and migration behaviour. In prostate cancer samples we analyzed the expression of both GTPases.  Results:   Cells grown on fibronectin displayed a more stretched morphology when Rab11 was inactivated, whereas inactivation of Rab25 led to reduced stretching. Overexpression of both Rab11 and Rab25 accelerated cell migration. Analysis of vesicular movement revealed higher transport efficiency in the inner cell compartment for Rab11 positive vesicles and in proximity to the membrane for Rab25 positive vesicles. Interestingly, we found Rab25 to be highly expressed in prostate cancer tissue.  Conclusion:   Taken together, our data suggest that Rab11 is mainly responsible for basal long-distance transport from the rear end to the front of the migrating cell, whereas Rab25 acts predominantly in the small-scale fast recycling within the tips of the cell.

PTEN suppresses tumor cell proliferation, survival, and growth mainly by inhibiting the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway through dephosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate. In addition to it role in tumor suppression, the PTEN-PI3K pathway controls many cellular functions, some of which may be important for cellular resistance to infection. Currently, the intersection between tumorigenic signaling pathways and cellular susceptibility to infection is not well defined. In this study we report that PTEN signaling regulates infection of both noncancerous and cancerous cells by multiple intracellular mycobacterial pathogens and that pharmacological modulation of PTEN signaling can affect mycobacterial infection. We found that PTEN deficiency renders multiple types of cells hyper-susceptible to infection by Mycoplasma and Mycobacterium bovis Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG). The lipid phosphatase activity of PTEN is required for attenuating infection. Furthermore, we found mycobacterial infection activates host cell Akt phosphorylation, and pharmacological inhibition of Akt or PI3K activity reduced levels of intracellular infection. Intriguingly, inhibition of mTOR, one of the downstream components of the Akt signaling and a promising cancer therapeutic target, also lowered intracellular Bacillus Calmette-Guérin levels in mammary epithelial cancer MCF-7 cells. These findings demonstrate a critical role of PTEN-regulated pathways in pathogen infection.

We hypothesized that ICS would not increase rates of long-term prostate cancer recurrence characterized by biochemical failure, disease dissemination, or mortality.  Study design and methods:   Consecutive patients undergoing RP by a single urologist over two 3-month periods 1 year apart were analyzed retrospectively.

Results:   A total of 116 consecutive patients were analyzed. Of these, 32 patients in the PAD group and 42 patients in the ICS group had follow-up of at least 4.75 years.

However, RNAi may also cause off-target silencing and elicit non-specific side effects. To achieve cell-specific gene silencing, a cell-selective promoter has to be used to drive RNAi expression. Furthermore, different terminators of cell-selective promoters may cause different silencing efficacies. In order to explore the best promoter and terminator combination and prove the cell-selective gene silencing effect of PSMAe/p (prostate-specific membrane antigen enhancer/promoter), we first constructed three plasmids by using PSMAe/p and three different terminators [poly(A), minipoly(A) and poly(U)] to explore the cell-selective driving ability of PSMAe/p by targeting EGFP (enhanced green fluorescent protein) in LNCaP, PC-3, EJ and HEK-293 (human embryonic kidney) cells. Then we chose NS (nucleostemin), an important endogenous gene of prostate cancer, and constructed the NS-targeting shRNA (small-hairpin RNA) expression plasmid by using PSMAe/p-poly(A) combination. Cell proliferation, cell cycle and early apoptosis in vitro and xenograft tumour growth in BALB/c nude mice in vivo were detected after NS knockdown. Results showed that PSMAe/p can drive EGFP silencing in LNCaP, not in PC-3, EJ and HEK-293 cells and PSMAe/p-poly(A) combination achieved the best silencing efficacy. Then PSMAe/p-shNS-poly(A) drives NS knockdown in LNCaP cells, not in PC-3, EJ and HEK-293 cells. Furthermore, RNAi-mediated NS knockdown not only reduces cell proliferation rate, reduces the percentage of S-stage cells and increases the percentage of G1-stage cells and increases the early apoptosis ratio in LNCaP cells in vitro, but also inhibited the LNCaP xenograft tumour growth in BALB/c nude mice in vivo by intratumoural injection. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that PSMAe/p-poly(A) combination is a promising delivery system for targeted RNAi gene therapy of prostate cancer. We showed one effective antitumour strategy by targeting NS protein, an important target in prostate cancer, with PSMAe/p-shNS-poly(A).

Here we report a novel interaction of ezrin with a HECT E3 ubiquitin ligase, WWP1/Aip5/Tiul1, a potential oncogene that undergoes genomic amplification and overexpression in human breast and prostate cancers. We show that ezrin binds to the WW domains of WWP1 via the consensus motif PPVY(477) present in ezrin's C-terminus. This association results in the ubiquitylation of ezrin, a process that requires an intact PPVY(477) motif. Interestingly ezrin ubiquitylation does not target the protein for degradation by the proteasome. We find that ezrin ubiquitylation by WWP1 in epithelial cells leads to the upregulation of Met level in absence of HGF stimulation and increases the response of Met to HGF stimulation as measured by the ability of the cells to heal a wound. Interestingly this effect requires ubiquitylated ezrin since it can be rescued, after depletion of endogenous ezrin, by wild type ezrin but not by a mutant of ezrin that cannot be ubiquitylated. Taken together our data reveal a new role for ezrin in Met receptor stability and activity through its association with the E3 ubiquitin ligase WWP1.

One approach to deal with such issues is to consider the principal strata effect (PSE, or equally, the survivor average causal effect). PSE is defined as the effect of treatment on the outcome among the subpopulation that would have been selected under either treatment arm. Unfortunately, the PSE cannot generally be estimated without the identifying assumptions; however, the bounds can be derived using a deterministic causal model.

The oncofetal protein Insulin-Like Growth Factor II has been demonstrated to be associated with aggressive tumor behavior in many organs including urothelial tumors and renal cell carcinoma. Our aim was to investigate the expression status of Insulin-Like Growth Factor II in benign prostate glands, high grade PIN and prostate adenocarcinoma, and to determine the role of Insulin-Like Growth Factor II in pathogenesis of prostate adenocarcinoma.  Material and method:   A total of 70 prostate adenocarcinoma cases accompanied by high grade PIN and benign prostate glands were evaluated by immunohistochemistry for the expression of Insulin-Like Growth Factor II.  Results:   Insulin-Like Growth Factor II expression was not seen in any of the 70 prostate adenocarcinoma and high grade PIN cases and benign prostate glands.  Conclusion:   Although the number of our cases was limited, our results suggested that Insulin-Like Growth Factor II protein expression was not included in the pathogenesis of the prostate adenocarcinomas and Insulin-Like Growth Factor II expression status cannot be used for diagnosis of prostate adenocarcinomas.""","""['Hülya Tosun Yildirim', 'Nilay Sentürk']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Turk Patoloji Derg""","""['Immunohistochemical expression of retinoblastoma and p53 tumor suppressor genes in prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia: comparison with prostatic adenocarcinoma and benign prostate.', 'Prostate specific membrane antigen expression in prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and adenocarcinoma: a study of 184 cases.', 'Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-2 and -3 expression in benign human prostate epithelium, prostate intraepithelial neoplasia, and adenocarcinoma of the prostate.', 'Changes in biomarker expression in the development of prostatic adenocarcinoma.', 'Prostate pathology: histologic and molecular perspectives.', 'IMP3 overexpression occurs in various important cancer types and is linked to aggressive tumor features: A tissue microarray study on 8,877 human cancers and normal tissues.', 'Does milk intake promote prostate cancer initiation or progression via effects on insulin-like growth factors (IGFs)?

CD147 is a transmembrane protein highly expressed in tumour cells which aids in tumour invasion and growth. BIGH3, an Extracellular matrix protein (ECM) which interacts with various ECM component in different tissue system and Stathmin(STMN1) is cytosolic microtubule destabilising protein also called as Oncoprotein18 due to its role in tumour promotion. So far the expression of BIGH3 and STMN1 remains undetermined in cancer subjects including TCC. We therefore studied the levels and molecular expression of these molecules in TCC patients, to evaluate their usefulness as diagnostic markers.  Methods:   Thirty consecutive TCC patients and two sets of control- 15 Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) patient and 15 healthy were taken. Serum and urine levels of these molecules were estimated by ELISA and relative mRNA expression by Q-PCR from tumour and normal urothelium. Post-Hoc analysis and ROC curve were determined to evaluate the significance and sensitivity and specificity.  Results:   The mean concentrations of these molecules were found to be significantly increased (p<0.001) in the serum and urine of TCC patients, with varying significance in each grade for different molecules. The urinary levels of CD147 (67 pg/ml) and serum STMN1 concentration (1.38 ng/ml) showed a specific increase as compared to the controls, while BIGH3 was elevated in both serum and urine samples. Molecular (mRNA) expression was elevated in the high grade (Muscle Invasive) stage of the disease for all the molecules, with a significant 3-fold increase that correlated with disease severity being observed for STMN1. ROC analysis gave optimal combination of sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis of the disease in urine and serum sample for STMN1.  Conclusion:   Of CD147, BIGH3 and STMN1, significant results were obtained for STMN1 and it could serve as the best possible diagnostic marker for TCC detection in future.""","""['Divya Bhagirath', 'Nitin Abrol', 'Rehan Khan', 'Manoj Sharma', 'Amlesh Seth', 'Alpana Sharma']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Clin Chim Acta""","""['A prospective evaluation of the diagnostic and potential prognostic utility of urinary human telomerase reverse transcriptase mRNA in patients with bladder cancer.', 'Expression of cytokeratin 20 in urinary cytology of patients with bladder carcinoma.', 'Testing for urinary hyaluronate improves detection and grading of transitional cell carcinoma.', 'The occult urothelial cancer.', 'Molecular biomarkers for predicting outcomes in urothelial carcinoma of the bladder.', 'Stathmin 1 is a biomarker for diagnosis of microvascular invasion to predict prognosis of early hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'Autophagy-associated HMGB-1 as a novel potential circulating non-invasive diagnostic marker for detection of Urothelial Carcinoma of Bladder.', 'Pan-Cancer Analysis of the Associations of TGFBI Expression With Prognosis and Immune Characteristics.', 'Can new immunoassay techniques improve bladder cancer diagnostics With protein biomarkers?', 'STMN1 accumulation is associated with dysplastic and neoplastic lesions in patients with ulcerative colitis.']"""

Net benefit curve analysis was used to gain insight into the use of the finPCPTRC for clinical decisions.  Results:   Prostate cancer (PCa) incidence (72.8%) was high in this Mexican referral cohort and 45.7% of men who were diagnosed with PCa had high-grade lesions (HGPCa, Gleason score >6). 1.3% of the patients were taking finasteride. The finPCPTRC was a superior diagnostic tool compared to prostate-specific antigen alone when discriminating patients with PCa from those without PCa (AUC = 0.784 vs. AUC = 0.687, p < 0.001) and when discriminating patients with HGPCa from those without HGPCa (AUC = 0.768 vs. AUC = 0.739, p < 0.001). The finPCPTRC underestimated the risk of PCa but overestimated the risk of HGPCa (both p < 0.001). Compared with other strategies to opt for biopsy, the net benefit would be larger with utilization of the finPCPTRC for patients accepting higher risks of HGPCa.  Conclusions:   Rates of biopsy-detectable PCa and HGPCa were high and 1.3% of this referral cohort in Mexico was taking finasteride.

Methods:   Thirteen men (median age 61.3 years) fulfilled the criteria of recurrent prostate cancer after HIFU undergoing sLRP with HIFU performed using Ablatherm devices (EDAP TMS, Lyon, France). The median interval from primary treatment and biochemical recurrence was 38 months, and the median serum PSA nadir after primary therapy was 1.05 ng\mL. Perioperative data and functional outcome were recorded for each patient. Complications were recorded and graded according to Clavien scale. The prostatectomy specimens were analyzed for Gleason score, extracapsular extension, and surgical margins. Mean follow-up was 14 months.  Results:   There was no perioperative mortality and no conversion to open surgery was necessary. Mean operation time was 220 minutes, mean blood loss was 150 mL, and none of the patients received any transfusion. On histopathologic evaluation, 8 patients had extracapsular extension (pT3a) and 5 patients had intracapsular disease (pT2b). Positive surgical margins (PSMs) were detected in 2 patients in the pT3a group. Gleason score was 7 (3 + 4) in 6 patients and (4 + 3) in 5 patients. Two patients had a Gleason score of 8.

However, the underlying mechanism is still unclear. We report here that histone methyltransferase NSD2 (also known as MMSET or WHSC1), a target of bromodomain protein ANCCA/ATAD2, acts as a strong coactivator of NF-κB by directly interacting with NF-κB for activation of target genes, including those for interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-8, vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), cyclin D, Bcl-2, and survivin, in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) cells. NSD2 is recruited to the target gene promoters upon induction and mediates NF-κB activation-associated elevation of histone H3K36me2 and H3K36me3 marks at the promoter, which involves its methylase activity. Interestingly, we found that NSD2 is also critical for cytokine-induced recruitment of NF-κB and acetyltransferase p300 and histone hyperacetylation. Importantly, NSD2 is overexpressed in prostate cancer tumors, and its overexpression correlates with NF-κB activation. Furthermore, NSD2 expression is strongly induced by tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and IL-6 via NF-κB and plays a crucial role in tumor growth. These results identify NSD2 to be a key chromatin regulator of NF-κB and mediator of the cytokine autocrine loop for constitutive NF-κB activation and emphasize the important roles played by NSD2 in cancer cell proliferation and survival and tumor growth.""","""['Ping Yang', 'Linlang Guo', 'Zhijian J Duan', 'Clifford G Tepper', 'Ling Xue', 'Xinbin Chen', 'Hsing-Jien Kung', 'Allen C Gao', 'June X Zou', 'Hong-Wu Chen']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Mol Cell Biol""","""['Reprogramming metabolism by histone methyltransferase NSD2 drives endocrine resistance via coordinated activation of pentose phosphate pathway enzymes.', 'The host environment promotes the constitutive activation of nuclear factor-kappaB and proinflammatory cytokine expression during metastatic tumor progression of murine squamous cell carcinoma.', 'Histone methyltransferase NSD2 mediates the survival and invasion of triple-negative breast cancer cells via stimulating ADAM9-EGFR-AKT signaling.', 'NSD2 as a Promising Target in Hematological Disorders.', 'The role of NSD1, NSD2, and NSD3 histone methyltransferases in solid tumors.', 'Natural compounds ursolic acid and digoxin exhibit inhibitory activities to cancer cells in RORγ-dependent and -independent manner.', 'ATPase family AAA domain-containing protein 2 (ATAD2): From an epigenetic modulator to cancer therapeutic target.', 'The genomic response of human granulosa cells (KGN) to melatonin and specific agonists/antagonists to the melatonin receptors.', 'Deletion of mdig enhances H3K36me3 and metastatic potential of the triple negative breast cancer cells.', 'Tumor-Promoting ATAD2 and Its Preclinical Challenges.']"""

Methods:   Nineteen patients with prostate carcinoma scheduled for robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy and lymph node (LN) dissection were included. ICG-(99m)Tc-nanocolloid was injected intraprostatically, guided by ultrasound. SN biopsy was performed using a combination of radioguidance and fluorescence guidance. Tracer distribution was visualized in paraffin-embedded prostate samples using ex vivo fluorescence imaging. This distribution was correlated to the number and location of the SNs identified on preoperative lymphoscintigraphy and SPECT/CT.  Results:   ICG-(99m)Tc-nanocolloid helped guide surgical excision of the SNs. Ex vivo fluorescence imaging revealed a large variation in the locations of intraprostatic tracer deposits among patients. Tracer deposits in the peripheral zone correlated with a higher number of visualized LNs than deposits in the central zone (on average, 4.7 vs. 2.4 LNs per patient). Furthermore, tracer deposits in the mid gland correlated with a higher number of visualized LNs than deposits near the base or apex of the prostate (on average, 6 vs. 3.5 LNs per patient).  Conclusion:   The hybrid nature of the tracer not only enables surgical guidance but also provides an opportunity to study the correlation between the location of tracer deposits within the prostate and the number and location of preoperatively visualized SNs.

For better understanding of the effects of these two polymorphisms on prostate cancer risk, a meta-analysis was performed.  Methods:   An extensive search was performed to identify all case-control studies investigating such association. The strength of association between these two polymorphisms and prostate cancer risk was assessed by odds ratio (OR) with the corresponding 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI).  Results:   A total of seven case-control studies were identified, among which five studies (1,257 cases and 1,956 controls) were eligible for Asp312Asn polymorphism and six studies (1,451 cases and 2,375 controls) were eligible for Lys751Gln polymorphism. Asp312Asn polymorphism was associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer in additive and recessive genetic models (additive model: OR = 1.68, 95 % CI = 1.28-2.22, P = 0.00; recessive model: OR = 1.65, 95 % CI = 1.27-2.15, P = 0.00). In the subgroup analysis, Asp312Asn polymorphism was associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer among Asians in all three genetic models (additive model: OR = 2.09, 95 % CI = 1.39-3.14, P = 0.00; dominant model: OR = 1.49, 95 % CI = 1.12-1.98, P = 0.01; recessive model: OR = 1.93, 95 % CI = 1.31-2.83, P = 0.00). However, no significant associations were found between Lys751Gln polymorphism and prostate cancer risk in the overall analyses or the subgroup analyses by ethnicity.

The primary objective of this study was to determine whether Ang-(1-7) effectively reduces prostate cancer metastasis in mice.  Methods:   Human PC3 prostate cancer cells were injected into the aortic arch via the carotid artery of SCID mice pre-treated with Ang-(1-7) or injected into the tibia of athymic mice, administered Ang-(1-7) for 5 weeks beginning 2 weeks post-injection. Tumor growth and volume were determined by bioluminescent and magnetic resonance imaging. The presence of tumors was confirmed by hematoxylin and eosin staining; TRAP histochemistry was used to identify osteolytic lesions. The effect of Ang-(1-7) on osteoclastogenesis was assessed in differentiated bone marrow cells.  Results:   Pre-treatment with Ang-(1-7) prevented metastatic tumor formation following intra-aortic injection of PC3 cells, while 83% of untreated mice developed tumors in metastatic sites. Circulating VEGF was significantly higher in control mice compared to mice administered Ang-(1-7). A 5-week regimen of the heptapeptide hormone attenuated intra-tibial tumor growth; Ang-(1-7) was significantly higher in the tibia of treated mice than in control animals. Osteoclastogenesis was reduced by 50% in bone marrow cells differentiated in the presence of Ang-(1-7), suggesting that the heptapeptide hormone prevents the formation of osteolytic lesions to reduce tumor survival in the bone microenvironment.

The purpose of this study was to determine the anti-proliferative and anti-angiogenic efficacy of angiotensin-(1-7) [Ang-(1-7)], an endogenous peptide hormone, in human prostate cancer xenografts.  Methods:   Human LNCaP prostate cancer cells were injected into the flank of athymic mice and tumors were treated with Ang-(1-7) for 54 days. Tumor growth and angiogenesis were determined by immunohistochemistry and western blot hybridization.  Results:   Ang-(1-7) markedly reduced the volume and wet weight of LNCaP xenograft tumors. Histological analysis of tumor sections from saline-treated mice showed increased Ki67 immunoreactivity and enhanced phosphorylation of the MAP kinases ERK1/2 compared to tumors from Ang-(1-7)-treated mice, suggesting that the heptapeptide reduces cell proliferation. Intratumoral vessel density was decreased in Ang-(1-7)-treated mice with an associated reduction in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and placental growth factor (PlGF), suggesting that the heptapeptide attenuates vascularization by reducing angiogenic factors. Ang-(1-7) administration markedly increased the soluble fraction of VEGF receptor 1 (sFlt-1), with a concomitant reduction in VEGF receptors 1 and 2. sFlt-1 serves as a decoy receptor that traps VEGF and PlGF, making the ligands unavailable to membrane-bound VEGF receptors and preventing activation of pro-angiogenic signaling.  Conclusions:   The decrease in PlGF and VEGF coupled with the increase in sFlt-1 suggests that Ang-(1-7) may serve as a novel anti-angiogenic therapy for prostate cancer.

Some antimicrobial peptides have become therapeutic candidates as new anticancer agents. As part of an effort to develop new antimicrobial and/or anticancer agents from natural peptides with low molecular weights, we have investigated the shortest bioactive analogues, which were derived from a 24-residue antimicrobial peptide, Brevinin-1EMa. Recently, we found four bioactive undecapeptides derived from a cationic, amphipathic α-helical, 11-residue peptide (named herein GA-W2: FLGWLFKWASK-NH(2)) (Won et al., 2011). In order to identify the potential of these peptides as anticancer agents, we investigated the anticancer activity of four undecapeptides against seven tumor cell lines such as A498 (kidney), A549 (lung), HCT116 (colon), MKN45 (stomach), PC-3 (prostate), SK-MEL-2 (skin) and SK-OV-3 (ovary). GA-K4 (FLKWLFKWAKK-NH(2)), which had the most potent antimicrobial activity of the four undecapeptides, also exhibited the most potent anticancer activity and synergistic effect in combination with doxorubicin.

However, according to NCBI, the gene has undergone several major iterations. Therefore, to understand the relationship between its structure and biological activities, we have analysed its expressed sequence in prostate cancer cell lines and tissues.  Methods:   Transcriptome-walking and targeted PCR were used to sequence the mRNA transcribed from PRKCZ. Hydropathy analysis was employed to analyse the hypothetical protein sequence subsequently translated and to identify an appropriate epitope to generate a specific monoclonal antibody.  Results:   A novel sequence was identified within the 3'-terminal domain of human PRKCZ that, in prostate cancer cell lines and tissues, is expressed during transcription and thereafter translated into protein (designated PKC-ζ(-PrC)) independent of conventional PKC-ζ(-a). The monoclonal antibody detected expression of this 96 kD protein only within malignant prostatic epithelium.  Interpretation:   Transcription and translation of this gene sequence, including previous intronic sequences, generates a novel specific biomarker of human prostate cancer.

They are involved in virtually every cellular process including development, apoptosis, and cell cycle regulation. MiRNAs are estimated to regulate the expression of 30% to 90% of human genes by binding to their target messenger RNAs (mRNAs). Widespread dysregulation of miRNAs has been reported in various diseases and cancer subtypes. Due to their prevalence and unique structure, these small molecules are likely to be the next generation of biomarkers, therapeutic agents and/or targets. Methods used to investigate miRNA expression include SYBR green I dye-based as well as Taqman-probe based qPCR. If miRNAs are to be effectively used in the clinical setting, it is imperative that their detection in fresh and/or archived clinical samples be accurate, reproducible, and specific. qPCR has been widely used for validating expression of miRNAs in whole genome analyses such as microarray studies. The samples used in this protocol were from patients who underwent radical prostatectomy for clinically localized prostate cancer; however other tissues and cell lines can be substituted in. Prostate specimens were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen after resection. Clinical variables and follow-up information for each patient were collected for subsequent analysis. Quantification of miRNA levels in prostate tumor samples. The main steps in qPCR analysis of tumors are: Total RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis, and detection of qPCR products using miRNA-specific primers. Total RNA, which includes mRNA, miRNA, and other small RNAs were extracted from specimens using TRIzol reagent. Qiagen's miScript System was used to synthesize cDNA and perform qPCR (Figure 1). Endogenous miRNAs are not polyadenylated, therefore during the reverse transcription process, a poly(A) polymerase polyadenylates the miRNA. The miRNA is used as a template to synthesize cDNA using oligo-dT and Reverse Transcriptase. A universal tag sequence on the 5' end of oligo-dT primers facilitates the amplification of cDNA in the PCR step. PCR product amplification is detected by the level of fluorescence emitted by SYBR Green, a dye which intercalates into double stranded DNA. Specific miRNA primers, along with a Universal Primer that binds to the universal tag sequence will amplify specific miRNA sequences. The miScript Primer Assays are available for over a thousand human-specific miRNAs, and hundreds of murine-specific miRNAs. Relative quantification method was used here to quantify the expression of miRNAs. To correct for variability amongst different samples, expression levels of a target miRNA is normalized to the expression levels of a reference gene. The choice of a gene on which to normalize the expression of targets is critical in relative quantification method of analysis. Examples of reference genes typically used in this capacity are the small RNAs RNU6B, RNU44, and RNU48 as they are considered to be stably expressed across most samples.

The micro RNA (miRNA) mir-21 has been shown to regulate invasiveness in cancer through translational repression of the Metaloproteinase (MMP) inhibitor RECK. Our aim is to investigate the levels of expression of RECK and miR-21 in PCa comparing with classical prognostic factors and disease outcome and also test if RECK is a target of miR-21 in in vitro study using PCa cell line.  Materials and methods:   To determine if RECK is a target of miR-21 in prostate cancer we performed an in vitro assay with PCa cell line DU-145 transfected with pre-miR-21 and anti-miR-21. To determine miR-21 and RECK expression levels in PCa samples we performed quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR).  Results:   The in vitro assays showed a decrease in expression levels of RECK after transfection with pre-miR-21, and an increase of MMP9 that is regulated by RECK compared to PCa cells treated with anti-miR-21. We defined three profiles to compare the prognostic factors. The first was characterized by miR-21 and RECK underexpression (N = 25) the second was characterized by miR-21 overexpression and RECK underexpression (N = 12), and the third was characterized by miR-21 underexpression and RECK overexpression (N = 16).

To detect this alteration, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is the method of choice. However, FISH has some disadvantages for widespread adoption in clinical practice. Subsequently, chromogenic in situ hybridization, which uses organic chromogens, and enzymatic metallography silver in situ hybridization have emerged as promising bright-field alternatives. Compared with chromogenic in situ hybridization, silver in situ hybridization signals are very distinct and superior with regard to signal clarity and resolution, but the method excludes multicolor protocols. Based on the ERG break-apart FISH assay, we established a dual-color ERG break-apart assay using combined chromogenic in situ hybridization and silver in situ hybridization (CS-ISH) and compared these results with those obtained by FISH. We assessed 178 PCa and 10 benign specimens for their ERG rearrangement status by applying dual-color FISH and CS-ISH ERG break-apart assays to consecutive sections. We observed a highly significant concordance (97.7%) between FISH- and CS-ISH-based results (Pearson's correlation coefficient = 0.955, P < 0.001). Our findings demonstrate that the ERG rearrangement status can reliably be assessed by CS-ISH. Further, the CS-ISH technique combines the accuracy and precision of FISH with the ease of bright-field microscopy. This tool allows a much broader spectrum of applications in which to study the biological role and clinical use of ERG rearrangements in PCa.""","""['Martin Braun', 'Julia Stomper', 'Diana Boehm', 'Wenzel Vogel', 'Veit J Scheble', 'Nicolas Wernert', 'David Adler', 'Falko Fend', 'Glen Kristiansen', 'Sven Perner']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""J Mol Diagn""","""['A novel four-color fluorescence in situ hybridization assay for the detection of TMPRSS2 and ERG rearrangements in prostate cancer.', 'Frequent TMPRSS2-ERG rearrangement in prostatic small cell carcinoma detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization: the superiority of fluorescence in situ hybridization over ERG immunohistochemistry.', 'ERG rearrangement is specific to prostate cancer and does not occur in any other common tumor.', 'The prognostic and predictive value of TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion and ERG protein expression in prostate cancer biopsies.', 'Clinical applications of novel ERG immunohistochemistry in prostate cancer diagnosis and management.', 'Array-based DNA-methylation profiling in sarcomas with small blue round cell histology provides valuable diagnostic information.', 'TMPRSS2:ERG Gene Fusions in Prostate Cancer of West African Men and a Meta-Analysis of Racial Differences.', 'Epigenomic profiling of prostate cancer identifies differentially methylated genes in TMPRSS2:ERG fusion-positive versus fusion-negative tumors.', 'A new bright-field dual-colour chromogenic and silver in situ hybridization method for the detection of FGFR1 gene copy number status.']"""

The current study investigates whether delayed cancer detection is related to lack of health insurance, physician shortage and higher percentages of Hispanics rather than WI per se since these factors are directly related to delayed cancer detection and may confound WI.  Methods:   Cancer data and potential determinants of delayed cancer detection are derived from Texas Cancer Registry, Texas State Data Center, and Texas Department of State Health Services and U.S. Census Bureau. Texas cancer data from 1997 to 2003 are aggregated to calculate age-adjusted late- and early-stage cancer detection rates. The WI for each county is computed using data from the USA Census 2000. A weighted Tobit regression model is used to account for population size and censoring. The percentage of late-stage cancer cases is the dependent variable while independent variables include WI and the aforementioned potential confounders.  Results:   Delayed detection of breast, lung, colorectal and female genital cancers is associated with higher percentage of uninsured residents (p < 0.05). Delayed detection is also associated with physician shortage and lower percentages of Hispanics for certain cancers ceteris paribus ( p < 0.05). The percentage of late-stage cases is positively correlated with WI for lung, and prostate cancers after adjusting for confounders ( p < 0.05).  Conclusions:   The percentages of uninsured and Hispanic residents as well as physician supply are determinants of delayed detection for several cancers independently of WI, and vice versa. Identification of these determinants provides the evidence-base critical for decision makers to address specific issues for promoting early detection in effective cancer control.""","""['Gordon Gong', 'Eric Belasco', 'Kristopher A Hargrave', 'Conrad P Lyford', 'Billy U Philips Jr']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Int J Equity Health""","""['Socioeconomic deprivation as a determinant of cancer mortality and the Hispanic paradox in Texas, USA.', 'Correlation of the ratio of metastatic to non-metastatic cancer cases with the degree of socioeconomic deprivation among Texas counties.', 'Comparison of Insurance Status and Diagnosis Stage Among Patients With Newly Diagnosed Cancer Before vs After Implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.', 'Affordable Care Act and cancer stage at diagnosis in an underserved population.', 'The joint effects of census tract poverty and geographic access on late-stage breast cancer diagnosis in 10 US States.', 'Advanced stage presentation and its determinant factors among colorectal cancer patients in Amhara regional state Referral Hospitals, Northwest Ethiopia.', 'Sociodemographic Determinants in Breast Cancer Screening among Uninsured Women of West Texas.', 'Socio-economic inequalities in stage at diagnosis, and in time intervals on the lung cancer pathway from first symptom to treatment: systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Improving Cancer Risk Awareness Including Obesity as a Risk Factor for Cancer in a Small U.S. Community.', 'How do integrated health care systems address racial and ethnic disparities in colon cancer?']"""

Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) promises to make it a successful imaging tool for improving many aspects of prostate cancer management.  Aim:   The aim of this study is to evaluate whether a modern multiparametric MRI can help either to better select prostate cancer cases for a nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy or to improve the functional evaluation related to neurovascular bundles preservation.  Main outcome measures:   The effect of preoperative MRI on neurovascular bundle management was examined for the frequency and the appropriateness of changes of the surgical plane on the basis of MRI indications.  Methods:   In a prospective study, 125 consecutive patients with biopsy proven prostate cancer who were scheduled to undergo bilateral nerve-sparing surgery. All patients included into the study were submitted to a preoperative multiparametric MRI. On the basis of MRI evaluation, patients were divided into two groups. Patients in group A were then submitted to a bilateral nerve-sparing (NS) radical prostatectomy (RP), whereas patients in group B were submitted to unilateral NS or non-NS RP.  Results:   In group A, the confirmation from the MRI study to perform a bilateral NS procedure was appropriate in 70 of 73 cases (95.9%), whereas in group B, the surgical plan was appropriate in 28 of 32 cases (87.5%). On the contrary, MRI findings suggested a change in the initial surgical plan (group B) for 32 of 105 cases (30.5%). Of these 32 cases in group B, MRI suggested to perform a unilateral NS procedure in 21 of 32 cases (65.6%) and a non-NS procedure in 11 of 32 cases (34.4%).

Methods:   Men with nonmetastatic prostate cancer receiving ADT were treated with subcutaneous denosumab 60 mg (n=734) or placebo (n=734) every 6 months for up to 36 months in a phase 3, randomized, double-blind study. Patients were instructed to take supplemental calcium and vitamin D. For this BMD responder analysis, the primary outcome measure was the percentage change in BMD from baseline to month 36 at the LS, FN and TH as measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. BMD at the distal 1/3 radius at 36 months was measured in a substudy of 309 patients.  Results:   At 36 months, significantly more patients in the denosumab arm had increases of >3% BMD from baseline at each site studied compared with placebo (LS, 78 vs 17%; FN, 48 vs 13%; TH, 48 vs 6%; distal 1/3 radius, 40 vs 7% (P<0.0001 for all)). BMD loss at the LS, FN and TH occurred in 1% of denosumab-treated patients vs 42% of placebo patients, and BMD gain at all three sites occurred in 69% of denosumab patients vs 8% of placebo patients. Lower baseline BMD was associated with higher-magnitude BMD responses to denosumab at the LS, FN and TH.

Based on a feature set derived from grey-level images, including first-order statistics, Haralick features, gradient features, semi-quantitative and quantitative (pharmacokinetic modelling) dynamic parameters, four kinds of classifiers were trained and compared: nonlinear support vector machine (SVM), linear discriminant analysis, k-nearest neighbours and naïve Bayes classifiers. A set of feature selection methods based on t-test, mutual information and minimum-redundancy-maximum-relevancy criteria were also compared. The aim was to discriminate between the relevant features as well as to create an efficient classifier using these features. The diagnostic performances of these different CADx schemes were evaluated based on a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. The evaluation database consisted of 30 sets of multiparametric MR images acquired from radical prostatectomy patients. Using histologic sections as the gold standard, both cancer and nonmalignant (but suspicious) tissues were annotated in consensus on all MR images by two radiologists, a histopathologist and a researcher. Benign tissue regions of interest (ROIs) were also delineated in the remaining prostate PZ. This resulted in a series of 42 cancer ROIs, 49 benign but suspicious ROIs and 124 nonsuspicious benign ROIs. From the outputs of all evaluated feature selection methods on the test bench, a restrictive set of about 15 highly informative features coming from all MR sequences was discriminated, thus confirming the validity of the multiparametric approach. Quantitative evaluation of the diagnostic performance yielded a maximal area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.89 (0.81-0.94) for the discrimination of the malignant versus nonmalignant tissues and 0.82 (0.73-0.90) for the discrimination of the malignant versus suspicious tissues when combining the t-test feature selection approach with a SVM classifier. A preliminary comparison showed that the optimal CADx scheme mimicked, in terms of AUC, the human experts in differentiating malignant from suspicious tissues, thus demonstrating its potential for assisting cancer identification in the PZ.""","""['Emilie Niaf', 'Olivier Rouvière', 'Florence Mège-Lechevallier', 'Flavie Bratan', 'Carole Lartizien']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Prostate cancer: computer-aided diagnosis with multiparametric 3-T MR imaging--effect on observer performance.', 'Computerized analysis of prostate lesions in the peripheral zone using dynamic contrast enhanced MRI.', 'Peripheral zone prostate cancer localization by multiparametric magnetic resonance at 3 T: unbiased cancer identification by matching to histopathology.', 'Computer aided-diagnosis of prostate cancer on multiparametric MRI: a technical review of current research.', 'Benign causes of diffusion restriction foci in the peripheral zone of the prostate: diagnosis and differential diagnosis.', 'Diagnostic Performance Evaluation of Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging in the Detection of Prostate Cancer with Supervised Machine Learning Methods.', 'Multi-resolution super learner for voxel-wise classification of prostate cancer using multi-parametric MRI.', 'Radiomics-Based Machine Learning Models for Predicting P504s/P63 Immunohistochemical Expression: A Noninvasive Diagnostic Tool for Prostate Cancer.', 'Robustness Assessment of Images From a 0.35T Scanner of an Integrated MRI-Linac: Characterization of Radiomics Features in Phantom and Patient Data.', 'Automatic Segmentation of Pelvic Cancers Using Deep Learning: State-of-the-Art Approaches and Challenges.']"""

Its anticancer properties have been demonstrated both, in cancer cell lines as well as tumors in animal models. It has been shown that SFN inhibits cell proliferation, induces apoptosis, autophagy, and sensitizes cancer cells to therapies. As induction of catabolic processes is often related to perturbation in protein synthesis we aimed to investigate the impact of SFN on this process in PC-3 human prostate cancer cells. In the present study we show that SFN inhibits protein synthesis in PC-3 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner which is accompanied by a decreased phosphorylation of mTOR substrates. Translation inhibition is independent of mitochondria-derived ROS as it is observed in PC-3 derivatives devoid of functional mitochondrial respiratory chain (Rho0 cells). Although SFN affects mitochondria and slightly decreases glycolysis, the ATP level is maintained on the level characteristic for control cells. Inhibition of protein synthesis might be a protective response of prostate cancer cells to save energy. However, translation inhibition contributes to the death of PC-3 cells due to decreased level of a short-lived protein, survivin. Overexpression of this anti-apoptotic factor protects PC-3 cells against SFN cytotoxicity. Protein synthesis inhibition by SFN is not restricted to prostate cancer cells as we observed similar effect in SKBR-3 breast cancer cell line.""","""['Aleksandra Wiczk', 'Dagmara Hofman', 'Grażyna Konopa', 'Anna Herman-Antosiewicz']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Biochim Biophys Acta""","""['D,L-Sulforaphane-induced cell death in human prostate cancer cells is regulated by inhibitor of apoptosis family proteins and Apaf-1.', 'Sulforaphane-induced cell death in human prostate cancer cells is initiated by reactive oxygen species.', 'Sulforaphane retards the growth of UM-UC-3 xenographs, induces apoptosis, and reduces survivin in athymic mice.', 'Modulation of mitochondrial functions by the indirect antioxidant sulforaphane: a seemingly contradictory dual role and an integrative hypothesis.', 'Multi-targeted prevention of cancer by sulforaphane.', 'How to Tackle Bacteriophages: The Review of Approaches with Mechanistic Insight.', 'Sulforaphane Ameliorates Metabolic Changes Associated With Status Epilepticus in Immature Rats.', 'Evaluation of the Anti-Shigellosis Activity of Dietary Isothiocyanates in Galleria mellonella Larvae.', 'Sulforaphane: A Broccoli Bioactive Phytocompound with Cancer Preventive Potential.', 'Induction of the Stringent Response Underlies the Antimicrobial Action of Aliphatic Isothiocyanates.']"""

We hypothesized that shared expression alterations in PCa and benign prostates containing PCa (BPCs) would have a higher potential for independent validation than alterations identified in BPCs alone. Expression analyses were performed on 37 PCas and 36 unmatched BPCs and were contrasted with 28 benign prostates (BPs) from patients free of PCa. Most of the protein-coding genes and nonexonic RNAs selected according to the hypothesis were validated by quantitative RT-PCR in an independent set of 51 BPCs and BPs. A statistical model based on two markers distinguished BPCs from BPs in the RT-PCR set and in an external microarray (area under the curve = 0.84 and 0.90, respectively). In addition, genes with predominant expression in stroma were identified by expression profiling of pure stroma and epithelial cells.

Patients and methods:   From 2008 to 2011, 134 men were prospectively administered the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF), American Urological Association Symptom Index (AUA-SI), and quality-of-life (QoL) questionnaires before and after undergoing a single 12-core PNBx. Comparisons of IIEF and AUA-SI scores before and after PNBx, based upon baseline characteristics and prostate cancer (PCa) diagnosis, were performed. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression models were used to characterize predictors of change in IIEF scores.  Results:   In the 85 men who fulfilled the inclusion criteria, there were no significant differences between the mean (sd) total pre-biopsy and the mean (sd) post-biopsy IIEF scores: 57.8 (12.9) vs 54.3 (17.2). Subgroup analysis showed that men who had biopsy-proven PCa had significantly greater changes in their post-biopsy IIEF scores compared with men without (-10.1 vs. 1.0; P < 0.001). After specific analyses of the IIEF domains in these groups we found significant decreases in every domain, including erectile function (P = 0.01). On multivariate analyses, only PCa diagnosis was associated with a significant change in IIEF (odds ratio 7.2; P = 0.003). There were no differences in AUA-SI or QoL scores in the overall population or in subgroups.  Conclusions:   Cancer diagnosis appears to have an adverse effect on the erectile function of men undergoing PNBx but no effect on LUTS.

In a prior study we showed that prostate cancer PC-3 cells exhibit constitutively activated c-Met without exogenous hepatocyte growth factor (HGF); however whether this characteristic is due to an endogenous HGF/c-Met autocrine loop remains controversial. In the current study we examined the response of PC-3 cells to an anti-HGF neutralizing antibody or a small molecule Met kinase inhibitor (BMS-777607).  Methods:   Cell scattering was tested by monitoring cell morphology after HGF stimulation. Cell migration was examined by both ""wound-healing"" and transwell assasy and invasion was detected by Matrigel-coated transwell assay. Proliferation, survival and anoikis were determined by MTT, colony formation and trypan blue exclusion assay, respectively. Gene and protein expression were assessed by real-time PCR and Western blot, respectively.  Results:   Although HGF mRNA could be detected in PC-3 cells, the molecular weight of secreted ""HGF"" protein was inconsistent with the functional recombinant HGF. Furthermore, conditioned medium from PC-3 cell cultures was ineffective at triggering either motogenic behavior or c-Met signaling in DU145, another prostate cancer cell line expressing c-Met but lacking basal c-Met activation. PC-3 cells also were not responsive to the anti-HGF neutralizing antibody in experiments assessing proliferation, migration, or c-Met signaling. BMS-777607 treatment with micromolar doses nonetheless led to significant inhibition of multiple PC-3 cell functions including proliferation, clonogenicity, migration and invasion. At the molecular level, BMS-777607 suppressed autophosphorylated c-Met and downstream c-Src and Akt pathways.  Conclusions:   These results suggest that the constitutive c-Met activation in PC-3 is independent of autocrine stimulation. Because PC-3 cells were responsive to BMS-777607 but not the anti-HGF antibody, the findings also indicate that under circumstances where c-Met is constitutively hyperactive in the absence of functional HGF, targeting the c-Met receptor remains a viable therapeutic option to impede cancer progression.""","""['Yao Dai', 'Dietmar W Siemann']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['BMS-777607, a small-molecule met kinase inhibitor, suppresses hepatocyte growth factor-stimulated prostate cancer metastatic phenotype in vitro.', 'Differential responses of MET activations to MET kinase inhibitor and neutralizing antibody.', 'A novel rabbit anti-hepatocyte growth factor monoclonal neutralizing antibody inhibits tumor growth in prostate cancer cells and mouse xenografts.', 'Roles of the HGF/Met signaling in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma: Focus on tumor immunity (Review).', 'Hepatocyte growth factor/MET in cancer progression and biomarker discovery.', 'Therapeutic targeting of anoikis resistance in cutaneous melanoma metastasis.', 'Targeting c-Met in the treatment of urologic neoplasms: Current status and challenges.', 'From Therapy Resistance to Targeted Therapies in Prostate Cancer.', 'Excess hepsin proteolytic activity limits oncogenic signaling and induces ER stress and autophagy in prostate cancer cells.', 'TYRO3: A potential therapeutic target in cancer.']"""

Application of mass spectrometry to protein and peptide measurement can provide advantages including high sensitivity, the ability to multiplex analytes, and high specificity at the amino acid sequence level. In our previous study, we demonstrated excellent reproducibility of mass spectrometry-selective reaction monitoring (MS-SRM) assays when applying standardized standard operating procedures (SOPs) to measure synthetic peptides in a complex sample, as lack of reproducibility has been a frequent criticism leveled at the use of mass spectrometers in the clinical laboratory compared to immunoassays. Furthermore, an important caveat of SRM-based assays for proteins is that many low-abundance analytes require some type of enrichment before detection with MS. This adds a level of complexity to the procedure and the potential for irreproducibility increases, especially across different laboratories with different operators. The purpose of this study was to test the interlaboratory reproducibility of SRM assays with various upfront enrichment strategies and different types of clinical samples (representing real-world body fluids commonly encountered in routine clinical laboratories). Three different, previously published enrichment strategies for low-abundance analytes and a no-enrichment strategy for high-abundance analytes were tested across four different laboratories using different liquid chromatography-SRM (LC-SRM) platforms and previously developed SOPs.

We explored the potential advantages of using an instrumental variable approach in the context of primary androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for prostate cancer.  Methods:   We identified 31,930 men in the linked Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare database with a diagnosis of prostate cancer who were not treated definitively with radical prostatectomy or radiation in the years 1992 through 2002, with follow-up through 2005. The association between use of primary ADT and overall, prostate cancer-specific, and nonprostate cancer survival was assessed using multivariable regression and instrumental variable methods. Two instrumental variables, based on region and urologist prescribing preference, were constructed and analyzed using exogenous probit models. Prespecified subgroup analyses in patients with lower-risk and higher-risk prostate tumors were also carried out.  Results:   In the overall cohort, standard multivariable regression analyses showed a significantly increased risk of prostate cancer-related death, whereas the instrumental variable approaches showed a protective effect of primary ADT, which was significant for the urologist preference instrument (hazard ratio: 0.74; 95% confidence interval, 0.60-0.93). In the high-risk subgroup, using urologist preference for primary ADT as the instrument, there was a significant reduction in overall mortality (hazard ratio: 0.75; 95% confidence interval, 0.57-0.99), driven by a large reduction in prostate cancer-specific mortality.

Assuming that exposure to light early in life could determine the stability of an individual's circadian system later in life, the present hypothesis proposes that time of year and location of birth (i.e., season and latitude) and thus differential Zeitgeber strengths may be key contributors to a person's susceptibility of developing mood disorders like seasonal affective disorder (SAD) and common internal cancers such as those of breast and prostate. Consequently, when and where people are born might critically predispose them to both mood disorders and internal cancers, and may affect the onset and course of such illnesses. This paper develops a causal framework and presents suggestions for rigorous tests of the associated corollary and predictions.

However, because conventional transducers generate a signal that is directly proportional to the concentration of the target molecule, ultralow concentrations of the molecule result in variations in the physical properties of the sensor that are tiny, and therefore difficult to detect with confidence. Here we present a signal-generation mechanism that redefines the limit of detection of nanoparticle sensors by inducing a signal that is larger when the target molecule is less concentrated. The key step to achieve this inverse sensitivity is to use an enzyme that controls the rate of nucleation of silver nanocrystals on plasmonic transducers. We demonstrate the outstanding sensitivity and robustness of this approach by detecting the cancer biomarker prostate-specific antigen down to 10(-18) g ml(-1) (4 × 10(-20) M) in whole serum.""","""['Laura Rodríguez-Lorenzo', 'Roberto de la Rica', 'Ramón A Álvarez-Puebla', 'Luis M Liz-Marzán', 'Molly M Stevens']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Nat Mater""","""['Addendum: Plasmonic nanosensors with inverse sensitivity by means of enzyme-guided crystal growth.', 'Corrigendum: Plasmonic nanosensors with inverse sensitivity by means of enzyme-guided crystal growth.', 'Erratum: Corrigendum: Plasmonic nanosensors with inverse sensitivity by means of enzyme-guided crystal growth.', 'Prostate cancer: Novel ""inverse sensitivity"" enzyme-linked crystal-growth assay to detect ultralow PSA levels.', 'Plasmonic nanosensors: Inverse sensitivity.', 'Plasmonic nanosensors: Inverse sensitivity.', 'Superstructure of silver crystals in a caged framework for plasmonic inverse sensing.', 'A plasmonic nanosensor for immunoassay via enzyme-triggered click chemistry.', 'Silver nanoparticle in biosensor and bioimaging: Clinical perspectives.', 'Stabilization of Silver and Gold Nanoparticles: Preservation and Improvement of Plasmonic Functionalities.', 'Full Control of Plasmonic Nanocavities Using Gold Decahedra-on-Mirror Constructs with Monodisperse Facets.', 'Nanoparticles for Biomedical Application and Their Synthesis.', 'Monocrystalline Labeling Enables Stable Plasmonic Enhancement for Isolation-Free Extracellular Vesicle Analysis.', 'Analyte-mediated formation and growth of nanoparticles for the development of chemical sensors and biosensors.', 'Nanoparticle-based mobile biosensors for the rapid detection of sepsis biomarkers in whole blood.']"""

We demonstrate here that 2-(p-hydroxyanilino)-4-(p-chlorophenyl)thiazole (SKi, also referred to as SKI-II), FTY720 (Fingolimod), and (S)-FTY720 vinylphosphonate inhibit sphingosine kinase 1 activity with distinct kinetics, indicating that these compounds exhibit different binding modalities with sphingosine kinase 1. Thus, SKi is a mixed inhibitor of sphingosine and ATP binding, whereas FTY720 is competitive with sphingosine and uncompetitive with ATP, and (S)-FTY720 vinylphosphonate is uncompetitive with sphingosine and is a mixed inhibitor with respect to ATP. A novel 'see-saw' model is proposed for the binding of inhibitor to catalytic and allosteric sites, the latter dependent on substrate binding, that provides an explanation for the different inhibitor kinetics. In addition, we demonstrate that the expression level and properties unique to an N-terminal 86 amino-acid isoform variant of sphingosine kinase 1 (SK1b) in prostate cancer cells reduce its sensitivity to SKi-induced proteasomal degradation in comparison to SK1a, i.e. these two N-terminal variants of sphingosine kinase 1 (SK1a and SK1b) have different properties. The reduced sensitivity of SK1b to proteasomal degradation in response to SKi is translated into specific changes in ceramide and S1P levels that leads to apoptosis of androgen-sensitive but not androgen-independent LNCaP prostate cancer cells. Therefore, our proposed 'see-saw' model might be usefully employed in the design of sphingosine kinase inhibitors to promote apoptosis of chemotherapeutic resistant cancer cells.""","""['Keng Gat Lim', 'Francesca Tonelli', 'Evgeny Berdyshev', 'Irina Gorshkova', 'Tamara Leclercq', 'Stuart M Pitson', 'Robert Bittman', 'Susan Pyne', 'Nigel J Pyne']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Int J Biochem Cell Biol""","""['The sphingosine kinase 1 inhibitor 2-(p-hydroxyanilino)-4-(p-chlorophenyl)thiazole induces proteasomal degradation of sphingosine kinase 1 in mammalian cells.', 'FTY720 and (S)-FTY720 vinylphosphonate inhibit sphingosine kinase 1 and promote its proteasomal degradation in human pulmonary artery smooth muscle, breast cancer and androgen-independent prostate cancer cells.', 'Proteasomal degradation of sphingosine kinase 1 and inhibition of dihydroceramide desaturase by the sphingosine kinase inhibitors, SKi or ABC294640, induces growth arrest in androgen-independent LNCaP-AI prostate cancer cells.', 'Roles, regulation and inhibitors of sphingosine kinase 2.', 'Sphingosine 1-phosphate signalling in cancer.', 'Expression Profile of Sphingosine Kinase 1 Isoforms in Human Cancer Tissues and Cells: Importance and Clinical Relevance of the Neglected 1b-Isoform.', 'Resveratrol Affects Sphingolipid Metabolism in A549 Lung Adenocarcinoma Cells.', 'The sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 2/4 antagonist JTE-013 elicits off-target effects on sphingolipid metabolism.', 'Transcriptional Regulation of Sphingosine Kinase 1.', 'Sphingosine-1-Phosphate in the Tumor Microenvironment: A Signaling Hub Regulating Cancer Hallmarks.']"""

Material and methods:   This is a population survival study of incident cases of prostate cancer in four Spanish areas: Basque Country, Girona, Murcia and Navarra. We calculated the relative survival (RS) at 5 years and its 95% confidence intervals using a cohort analysis and adjusted for age. To assess the trend in survival between the periods (1995-1999 and 2000-2003) a Poisson regression model was used, adjusting for age, region and period, obtaining the relative risk of death.  Results:   The number of patients diagnosed during the 1995- 1999 period was 6493 and 8331 in the period 2000-03. The RS at 5 years adjusted for age increased significantly, from 75.3% (95% CI 73.3-77.2) in the period 1995-99 to 85% (95% CI 83.4-86.4) in the period 2000-03.  Conclusion:   In Spain the survival of patients with prostate cancer has increased significantly from 1999 to 2003, probably due to the advancement in diagnosis produced by the opportunistic screening of prostate-specific antigen (PSA). Differences in the dissemination and use of the PSA level could explain the observed geographic differences in the increase of survival. It would be necessary to carry out studies to quantify the produced overdiagnosis by screening with PSA in prostate cancer.""","""['Rafael Marcos-Gragera', 'Diego Salmerón', 'Isabel Izarzugaza', 'Eva Ardanaz', 'Bernat-Carles Serdà', 'Nerea Larrañaga', 'Erkuden San Román', 'Carmen Navarro', 'María-Dolores Chirlaque']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Clin Transl Oncol""","""['Cancer survival in Spain: estimate for nine major cancers.', 'Prostate cancer incidence trends in Spain before and during the prostate-specific antigen era: impact on mortality.', 'Trends in prostate cancer survival in Sweden, 1960 through 1988: evidence of increasing diagnosis of nonlethal tumors.', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen-Based Screening for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Evidence Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen-Based Screening for Prostate Cancer: Evidence Report and Systematic Review for the US Preventive Services Task Force.', 'Prostate Cancer Survival by Risk and Other Prognostic Factors in Mallorca, Spain.', 'The PI3K/mTOR dual inhibitor BEZ235 nanoparticles improve radiosensitization of hepatoma cells through apoptosis and regulation DNA repair pathway.', 'Literature review of the burden of prostate cancer in Germany, France, the United Kingdom and Canada.', 'Cancer survival in adult patients in Spain.

Estimates were adjusted for time outdoors, vitamin D intake and other factors known to affect vitamin D status.  Results:   Persons who tended to stay in the shade had lower vitamin D levels than those who never stayed in the shade (62.5 vs. 68.8 nmol/L respectively, p=0.01), and this association remained in persons who spent less than 50% (p=0.02) but not in those who spent more than 50% of their time outdoors. Wearing a hat, long sleeves, sunglasses and use of sunscreen or umbrella were not associated with vitamin D status after adjustments, including after stratification by time outdoors.

CsA attenuated cell growth by inducing a G1 arrest through the inhibition of mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling. In this context, Akt was paradoxically activated downstream of the EGF receptor (EGFR)-mediated increase in phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP₃) production. However, CsA also caused a Ca²⁺/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase β (CaMKKβ)-dependent activation of AMPK, which inhibits mTORC1 signaling; this led to ineffective Akt signaling. An EGFR or Akt inhibitor increased the growth suppressive activity of CsA, whereas the combination of an AMPK inhibitor and CsA markedly rescued cells from the G1 arrest and increased cell growth.

Materials and methods:   A total of 130 patients were randomly assigned to one of two groups: an intervention group (IG, n=64), instructed to reduce their intake of insoluble dietary fibres and lactose, a standard care group (SC, n=66), instructed to continue their normal diet. Gastrointestinal side effects and other aspects of HRQOL were evaluated from baseline up to 2 months after completed radiotherapy, using the EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-PR25 and the study-specific Gastrointestinal Side Effects Questionnaire (GISEQ). A scale indicating adherence to dietary instructions was developed from a Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ), with lower scores representing better compliance. Descriptive and inferential statistical analyses were conducted.  Results:   There was an interaction effect between randomization and time in the FFQ Scores (p<0.001), indicating that both groups followed their assigned dietary instructions. The dietary intervention had no effect on gastrointestinal side effects or other aspects of HRQOL. During radiotherapy, the percentage of patients with bowel symptoms and bloated abdomen was lower in IG compared to SC, but the between-group differences were not statistically significant. During radiotherapy, the percentage of patients with bowel symptoms, urinary symptoms, pain, fatigue and diminished physical and role functioning increased in both groups.  Conclusions:   The dietary intervention had no effect on gastrointestinal side effects or other aspects of HRQOL.

However, there is currently no evidence supporting early salvage radiation therapy (eSRT) as equivalent to aRT in improving freedom from biochemical recurrence (BCR) after radical prostatectomy (RP).  Objective:   To evaluate BCR-free survival for aRT versus observation followed by eSRT in cases of relapse in patients undergoing RP for pT3pN0, R0-R1 PCa.  Design, setting, and participants:   Using a European multi-institutional cohort, 890 men with pT3pN0, R0-R1 PCa were identified.  Intervention:   All patients underwent RP. Subsequently, patients were stratified into two groups: aRT versus initial observation followed by eSRT in cases of relapse. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSES: Propensity-matched analysis was employed, and patients were stratified into two groups: aRT versus observation and eventual eSRT, defined as RT given at a postoperative serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) ≤ 0.5 ng/ml at least 6 mo after RP. BCR, defined as PSA >0.20 ng/ml and rising after administration of RT, was compared between aRT and initial observation followed by eSRT in cases of relapse using Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression methods.  Results and limitations:   Overall, 390 (43.8%) and 500 (56.2%) patients were treated with aRT and initial observation, respectively. Within the latter group, 225 (45.0%) patients experienced BCR and underwent eSRT. In the postpropensity-matched cohort, the 2- and 5-yr BCR-free survival rates were 91.4% and 78.4% in aRT versus 92.8% and 81.8% in patients who underwent initial observation and eSRT in cases of relapse, respectively (p=0.9). No differences in the 2- and 5-yr BCR-free survival rates were found, even when patients were stratified according to pT3 substage and surgical margin status (all p ≥ 0.4). These findings were also confirmed in multivariable analyses (p=0.6). Similar results were achieved when the cut-off to define eSRT was set at 0.3 ng/ml (all p ≥ 0.5).  Conclusions:   The current study suggests that timely administration of eSRT is comparable to aRT in improving BCR-free survival in the majority of pT3pN0 PCa patients. Therefore, eSRT may not compromise cancer control but significantly reduces overtreatment associated with aRT.""","""['Alberto Briganti', 'Thomas Wiegel', 'Steven Joniau', 'Cesare Cozzarini', 'Marco Bianchi', 'Maxine Sun', 'Bertrand Tombal', 'Karin Haustermans', 'Tom Budiharto', 'Wolfgang Hinkelbein', 'Nadia Di Muzio', 'Pierre I Karakiewicz', 'Francesco Montorsi', 'Hein Van Poppel']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['When should we pull the trigger for post-radical prostatectomy radiotherapy?', 'Commentary on ""early salvage radiation therapy does not compromise cancer control in patients with pT3N0 prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy: Results of a match-controlled multi-institutional analysis"".

Objective:   To report biochemical recurrence-free survival (BRFS) outcomes for men who underwent RARP ≥5 yr ago at a single European centre.  Design, setting, and participants:   A total of 944 patients underwent RARP as monotherapy for PCa from January 2002 to December 2006 at Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden. Standard clinicopathologic variables were recorded and entered into a secure, ethics-approved database made up of those men with registered domiciles in Stockholm. The median follow-up time was 6.3 yr (interquartile range: 5.6-7.2).  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The outcome of this study was biochemical recurrence (BCR), defined as a confirmed prostate-specific antigen (PSA) of ≥0.2 ng/ml. Kaplan-Meier survival plots with log-rank tests, as well as Cox univariable and multivariable regression analyses, were used to determine BRFS estimates and determine predictors of PSA relapse, respectively.  Results and limitations:   The BRFS for the entire cohort at median follow-up was 84.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 82.2-87.1); estimates at 5, 7, and 9 yr were 87.1% (95% CI, 84.8-89.2), 84.5% (95% CI, 81.8-86.8), and 82.6% (95% CI, 79.0-85.6), respectively. Nine and 19 patients died of PCa and other causes, respectively, giving end-of-follow-up Kaplan-Meier survival estimates of 98.0% (95% CI, 95.5-99.1) and 94.1% (95% CI, 90.4-96.4), respectively. Preoperative PSA >10, postoperative Gleason sum ≥4 + 3, pathologic T3 disease, positive surgical margin status, and lower surgeon volume were associated with increased risk of BCR on multivariable analysis. This study is limited by a lack of nodal status and tumour volume, which may have confounded our findings.  Conclusions:   This case series from a single, high-volume, European centre demonstrates that RARP has satisfactory medium-term BRFS.

Although prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is an established marker for monitoring prostate cancer patients, correlations between PSA and disease outcomes during ZOL therapy are unclear.  Objective:   To evaluate the relationships among PSA kinetics, bone-directed therapy with ZOL, and clinical outcomes in men with bone metastases from CRPC using a ZOL phase 3 trial database.  Design, setting, and participants:   Exploratory analyses from a phase 3 trial in men with bone metastases from CRPC (n=643) randomized to ZOL or placebo every 3 wk.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   PSA levels during the first 3 mo of the study were evaluated in linear and logarithmic (log) models stratified using prognostic factors established in a ZOL phase 3 trial and a CRPC nomogram. Relative risks of SREs, bone disease progression (BDP), and death were calculated per 1 log (nanograms per milliliter) PSA increase. Baseline PSA models used the study median (PSA: 77.3 ng/ml) as the high/low cut-off point.  Results and limitations:   A total of 202 placebo- and 434 ZOL-treated patients were assessable. In both groups, PSA increases correlated with significantly increased risks of death, BDP, and first SRE. In the placebo and ZOL groups, associated increases in risk per 1 log (nanograms per milliliter) PSA increase were 29% (p<0.0001) and 10% (p<0.0074), respectively, for BDP, and 24% (p=0.0010) and 13% (p=0.0079), respectively, for first SRE. Limitations include the retrospective nature of these analyses and the potential confounding effects of concurrent antineoplastic therapies.

In typical immunoassays, analytes are captured, labeled, and quantified on a single surface (e.g., the bottom of a well plate). In order to minimize the background, this type of assay must be washed multiple times between each of these steps to ensure residual reagents (e.g., unbound labeling antibody) are removed from the system. In this manuscript, the immunoassay is fundamentally reconfigured, such that each reagent is confined to its own well and no wash steps are required. Using immiscible filtration assisted by surface tension (IFAST), a technique developed for nucleic acid and whole cell purifications, immunoassays can be drastically simplified such that all reagent manipulation is performed at the start of the assay (i.e., no pipetting steps are necessary during the assay). Analytes are bound to paramagnetic particles via antibodies and drawn through oil barriers between four isolated compartments: (1) sample well, (2) primary antibody labeling well, (3) secondary antibody labeling well, and (4) readout buffer well. Using this technique, we have demonstrated repeatable detection of as little as 188 fg of protein. IFAST immunoassay functionality is demonstrated by detecting a well accepted prostate cancer biomarker, prostate specific antigen (PSA). Assay performance was assessed by measuring known concentrations of recombinant PSA protein. The assay was then used to measure PSA concentrations in conditioned media and human plasma samples.""","""['Scott M Berry', 'Lindsey J Maccoux', 'David J Beebe']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Anal Chem""","""['One-step immunostrip test for the simultaneous detection of free and total prostate specific antigen in serum.', 'Novel immunoassay technique for rapid measurement of intracellular proteins using paramagnetic particles.', 'Femtomolar detection of prostate-specific antigen: an immunoassay based on surface-enhanced Raman scattering and immunogold labels.', 'Issues on standardization of immunoassays for prostate-specific antigen: a review.', 'Issues in the assessment of PSA immunoassays.', 'Integrated microscale immiscible phase extraction and isothermal amplification for colorimetric detection of Neisseria gonorrhoeae.', 'Escherichia coli Enumeration in a Capillary-Driven Microfluidic Chip with SERS.', 'Detection of anti-p53 autoantibodies in saliva using microfluidic chips for the rapid screening of oral cancer.', 'Centrifugation-Assisted Immiscible Fluid Filtration for Dual-Bioanalyte Extraction.', 'Microfluidic communicating vessel chip for expedited and automated immunomagnetic assays.']"""

While surgery remains the most commonly received treatment for localised disease in Australia more recently a robotic approach has emerged as an alternative to open and laparoscopic surgery. However, high level data is not yet available to support this as a superior approach or to guide treatment decision making between the alternatives. This paper presents the design of a randomised trial of Robotic and Open Prostatectomy for men newly diagnosed with localised prostate cancer that seeks to answer this question.  Methods/design:   200 men per treatment arm (400 men in total) are being recruited after diagnosis and before treatment through a major public hospital outpatient clinic and randomised to 1) Robotic Prostatectomy or 2) Open Prostatectomy. All robotic prostatectomies are being performed by one surgeon and all open prostatectomies are being performed by one other surgeon. Outcomes are being measured pre-operatively and at 6 weeks and 3, 6, 12 and 24 months post-surgery. Oncological outcomes are being related to positive surgical margins, biochemical recurrence +/- the need for further treatment. Non-oncological outcome measures include: pain, physical and mental functioning, fatigue, summary (preference-based utility scores) and domain-specific QoL (urinary incontinence, bowel function and erectile function), cancer specific distress, psychological distress, decision-related distress and time to return to usual activities. Cost modelling of each approach, as well as full economic appraisal, is also being undertaken.  Discussion:   The study will provide recommendations about the relative benefits of Robotic and Open Prostatectomy to support informed patient decision making about treatment for localised prostate cancer; and to assist in treatment services planning for this patient group.

Results:   A mixture of isopropyl alcohol: acetone: water: chloroform: and methanol extract of C. longa showed significant bioactivity. Further partition of this extract showed that bioactivity resides in the dichloromethane soluble fraction. Column chromatography of this fraction showed presence of biological activity only in ethyl acetate eluted fraction. HPLC, UV-Vis and Mass spectra studies showed presence three curcuminoids in this fraction besides few unidentified components.
