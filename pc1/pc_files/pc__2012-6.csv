Historically, androgen deprivation therapy and docetaxel based chemotherapy were the only treatments able to improve survival. Two studies have been published during last few months regarding the management of castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) progressed after docetaxel: for the first time second line therapies have been demonstrated to improve prognosis of these patients. The relevance of these trials is the reintroduction of chemotherapy and hormonal therapy in a disease once considered chemotherapy and castration resistant. All these data may change the traditional approach to CRPC but no evidences have came out from recently closed or ongoing clinical trials about the therapeutic algorithm. How to get oriented in this forest? We propose that patient's conditions, response and toxicities reported with previous treatments and, above all, dynamics and evolution of disease may influence the choice of subsequent therapies in docetaxel progressed CRPC.""","""['Amelia Altavilla', 'Roberto Iacovelli', 'Giuseppe Procopio', 'Enrico Cortesi']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Ther Adv Urol""","""['Treating Patients with Metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer: A Comprehensive Review of Available Therapies.', 'Systemic therapy in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: a systematic review.', 'EAU-ESTRO-SIOG Guidelines on Prostate Cancer.

Therefore, computational methods are needed to present clues to the biomedical community to explore genes that are more likely to be related to a specific disease as biomarker. We present biomarker identification problem using gene prioritization method called gene prioritization from microarray data based on shortest paths, extended with structural and biological properties and edge flux using voting scheme (GP-MIDAS-VXEF). The method is based on finding relevant interactions on protein interaction networks, then scoring the genes using shortest paths and topological analysis, integrating the results using a voting scheme and a biological boosting. We applied two experiments, one is prostate primary and normal samples and the other is prostate primary tumor with and without lymph nodes metastasis. We used 137 truly prostate cancer genes as benchmark. In the first experiment, GP-MIDAS-VXEF outperforms all the other state-of-the-art methods in the benchmark by retrieving the truest related genes from the candidate set in the top 50 scores found.

We report that Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent kinase kinase 2 (CaMKK2) expression increases and becomes nuclear or perinuclear in advanced PCa. In the TRAMP (transgenic adenocarcinoma of mouse prostate) model of PCa, CaMKK2 expression increases with PCa progression with many cells exhibiting nuclear staining. CaMKK2 expression is higher in human castration-resistant tumor xenografts compared with androgen-responsive xenografts and is markedly higher in the AR-expressing, tumorigenic cell line LNCaP compared with cell lines that are AR-nonexpressing and/or nontumorigenic. In LNCaP cells, dihydrotestosterone induced CaMKK2 mRNA and protein expression and translocation of CaMKK2 to the nucleus. Conversely, androgen withdrawal suppressed CaMKK2 expression. Knockdown of CaMKK2 expression by RNAi reduced LNCaP cell proliferation and increased percentages of cells in G(1) phase, whereas correspondingly reducing percentages in S phase, of the cell cycle. CaMKK2 knockdown reduced expression of the AR target gene prostate-specific antigen at both mRNA and protein levels, AR transcriptional activity driven by androgen responsive elements from the prostate-specific probasin gene promoter and levels of the AR-regulated cell cycle proteins, cyclin D1 and hyperphosphorylated Rb. Our results suggest that in PCa progression, CaMKK2 and the AR are in a feedback loop in which CaMKK2 is induced by the AR to maintain AR activity, AR-dependent cell cycle control, and continued cell proliferation.""","""['Loukia G Karacosta', 'Barbara A Foster', 'Gissou Azabdaftari', 'David M Feliciano', 'Arthur M Edelman']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""J Biol Chem""","""['Regulation and role of CAMKK2 in prostate cancer.', 'Nucleoporin 62 and Ca(2+)/calmodulin dependent kinase kinase 2 regulate androgen receptor activity in castrate resistant prostate cancer cells.', 'Down-regulation of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase 2 by androgen deprivation induces castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'GLUT12 promotes prostate cancer cell growth and is regulated by androgens and CaMKK2 signaling.', 'CaMKK2: a novel target for shaping the androgen-regulated tumor ecosystem.', 'Identification of calcium metabolism related score associated with the poor outcome in papillary thyroid carcinoma.', 'The role of CaMKK2 in Golgi-associated vesicle trafficking.', 'Androgen receptor signaling and spatial chromatin organization in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Systemic Ablation of Camkk2 Impairs Metastatic Colonization and Improves Insulin Sensitivity in TRAMP Mice: Evidence for Cancer Cell-Extrinsic CAMKK2 Functions in Prostate Cancer.', 'Regulation and role of CAMKK2 in prostate cancer.']"""

We previously proposed that compounds recruited to ligand-binding domain (LBD) surfaces could regulate AR activity in hormone-refractory PCa and discovered several surface modulators of AR function. Surprisingly, the most effective compounds bound preferentially to a surface of unknown function [binding function 3 (BF-3)] instead of the coactivator-binding site [activation function 2 (AF-2)]. Different BF-3 mutations have been identified in PCa or androgen insensitivity syndrome patients, and they can strongly affect AR activity. Further, comparison of AR x-ray structures with and without bound ligands at BF-3 and AF-2 showed structural coupling between both pockets. Here, we combine experimental evidence and molecular dynamic simulations to investigate whether BF-3 mutations affect AR LBD function and dynamics possibly via allosteric conversation between surface sites. Our data indicate that AF-2 conformation is indeed closely coupled to BF-3 and provide mechanistic proof of their structural interconnection. BF-3 mutations may function as allosteric elicitors, probably shifting the AR LBD conformational ensemble toward conformations that alter AF-2 propensity to reorganize into subpockets that accommodate N-terminal domain and coactivator peptides. The induced conformation may result in either increased or decreased AR activity. Activating BF-3 mutations also favor the formation of another pocket (BF-4) in the vicinity of AF-2 and BF-3, which we also previously identified as a hot spot for a small compound. We discuss the possibility that BF-3 may be a protein-docking site that binds to the N-terminal domain and corepressors.

GLOI has been considered a general marker of cell proliferation, but a direct link between the two has yet to be demonstrated. The aim of the present work was to clarify whether GLOI was involved in the proliferation control of LNCaP and PC3 human prostate cancer cells or might play a different role in the growth regulation of these cells.  Methods:   RNA interference was used to study the role of GLOI in cell proliferation or apoptosis. Cell proliferation was evaluated by [3H]thymidine incorporation assay and flow cytometry, that was also used to analyze apoptosis. Real-time TaqMan polymerase chain reaction and spectrophotometric analyses were used to study transcript levels or specific activity, respectively. Proteins levels were analyzed by Western blot. MG was measured by high-performance liquid chromatography.  Results:   We found that GLOI is not implicated in the proliferation control of LNCaP and PC3 cells but plays a role in the apoptosis of invasive prostate cancer PC3 cells, through a mechanism involving a specific MG-adduct and NF-kB signaling pathway.  Conclusions:   Our data represent the first systematic demonstration that GLOI cannot be considered a general marker of cell proliferation and that acts as a pro-survival factor in invasive PC3 cells by elusing apoptosis.

Age-adjusted PSA have been proposed as an alternative to serum PSA. The primary objective of the present study is to determine the age-specific PSA and the percentage of free PSA (%FPSA) in healthy Syrian men. A total of 3,000 healthy Syrian men over 40 years old participated in this study. All men were asked to have total serum (TPSA) and free PSA (FPSA) tested, a DRE, and, when recommended, a prostate biopsy. Serum TPSA levels correlated with age (r=0.30, p<0.001). The 95th percentile TPSA values ranged from 1.7 ng/mL in the age group 40-49 years to 5.8 ng/mL in the group 70-80 years. The general pattern for medians and the percentile values for FPSA across age groups were similar to those seen for TPSA concentrations (r=0.37, p<0.001). However, the %FPSA was fairly constant across age groups except for the higher ratios in the youngest age group. These findings confirm that the serum TPSA and FPSA levels correlate with age. Interestingly, however, Syrian men have lower PSA values compared with other races. Racial differences of PSA concentrations were observed.

Objective:   To determine whether there is an improvement in PCa risk prediction by adding these SNPs to existing predictors of PCa.  Design, setting, and participants:   Subjects included men in the placebo arm of the randomized Reduction by Dutasteride of Prostate Cancer Events (REDUCE) trial in whom germline DNA was available. All men had an initial negative prostate biopsy and underwent study-mandated biopsies at 2 yr and 4 yr. Predictive performance of baseline clinical parameters and/or a genetic score based on 33 established PCa risk-associated SNPs was evaluated.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) were used to compare different models with different predictors. Net reclassification improvement (NRI) and decision curve analysis (DCA) were used to assess changes in risk prediction by adding genetic markers.  Results and limitations:   Among 1654 men, genetic score was a significant predictor of positive biopsy, even after adjusting for known clinical variables and family history (p = 3.41 Ã 10(-8)). The AUC for the genetic score exceeded that of any other PCa predictor at 0.59. Adding the genetic score to the best clinical model improved the AUC from 0.62 to 0.66 (p<0.001), reclassified PCa risk in 33% of men (NRI: 0.10; p=0.002), resulted in higher net benefit from DCA, and decreased the number of biopsies needed to detect the same number of PCa instances. The benefit of adding the genetic score was greatest among men at intermediate risk (25th percentile to 75th percentile). Similar results were found for high-grade (Gleason score â¥ 7) PCa. A major limitation of this study was its focus on white patients only.  Conclusions:   Adding genetic markers to current clinical parameters may improve PCa risk prediction. The improvement is modest but may be helpful for better determining the need for repeat prostate biopsy.

Methods and materials:   A total of 502 patients were selected from a prospective database, who had localized prostate adenocarcinoma treated with 2-12 months of neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy (N-ADT) followed by external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) between 1994 and 2000, and had at least 2 NA PSA values. Seventy-four percent of patients had high-risk prostate cancer. Median initial PSA value, N-ADT duration, total ADT duration, and radiation therapy dose were 14 ng/mL, 6.9 months, 10.8 months, and 68 Gy, respectively.  Results:   At a median follow-up of 9.9 years, 210 patients have had a BF. Median PSAHT was 18 days. On univariate analysis, PSAHT was not shown to predict for BF (P=.69) or PCSS (P=.28). However, NA nadir PSA (nanPSA) and post-therapy nadir PSA (ptnPSA), when analyzed as continuous or categoric variables, predicted for BF (P<.001) and PCSS (P<.001). On multivariate analysis, nanPSA (P=.037) and ptnPSA (P<.001) continued to be significantly associated with BF. However, N-ADT duration lost significance (P=.67), and PSAHT remained a nonsignificant predictor (P=.97). For PCSS, multivariate analysis showed nanPSA (P=.049) and ptnPSA (P<.001) to be significant. Again PSAHT (P=.49) remained nonsignificant.  Conclusions:   In this large, prospective cohort of patients, NA PSA kinetics, expressed as PSAHT, did not predict BF or PCSS. However, nadir PSAs, in both the NA and post-therapy settings, were significant predictors of BF and PCSS. Optimization of therapy could potentially be based on early PSA response, with shorter durations of ADT for those predicted to do favorably, and intensification of therapy for those likely to have poorer outcomes.""","""['Marcus Foo', 'Mariel Lavieri', 'Tom Pickles']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Unification of a common biochemical failure definition for prostate cancer treated with brachytherapy or external beam radiotherapy with or without androgen deprivation.', 'Extreme-risk prostate adenocarcinoma presenting with prostate-specific antigen (PSA)>40 ng/ml: prognostic significance of the preradiation PSA nadir.', 'Biochemical response to androgen deprivation therapy before external beam radiation therapy predicts long-term prostate cancer survival outcomes.', 'Prognostic value of biochemical response to neoadjuvant androgen deprivation before external beam radiotherapy for prostate cancer: A systematic review of the literature.', 'Current role of neoadjuvant and adjuvant systemic therapy for high-risk localized prostate cancer.', 'The significance of metabolic response to neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy detected with 68GaGa-PSMA-11-PET/CT in high-risk prostate cancer patients treated with definitive radiotherapy.', 'Adjusting the duration of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) based on nadir PSA for high risk localized prostate cancer patients treated with definitive external beam radiation therapy and ADT.', 'A prospective study of the effect of testosterone escape on preradiotherapy prostate-specific antigen kinetics in prostate cancer patients undergoing neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy.', 'Stereotactic body radiotherapy with periprostatic hydrogel spacer for localized prostate cancer: toxicity profile and early oncologic outcomes.', 'Early biochemical predictors of survival in intermediate and high-risk prostate cancer treated with radiation and androgen deprivation therapy.']"""

Methods and materials:   Between 1989 and 2006, 2051 men with clinically localized prostate cancer received definitive RT alone (median dose, 76 Gy). The rates of aspirin use and statin use (defined as any use at the time of RT or during follow-up) were 36% and 34%, respectively. The primary endpoint of the study was an interval to biochemical failure (IBF) of less than 18 months, which has been shown to be the single strongest predictor of distant metastasis, prostate cancer survival, and overall survival after RT. Patient demographic characteristics and tumor staging factors were assessed with regard to associations with the endpoint. Univariate analysis was performed with the Ï(2) test for categorical variables and the Wilcoxon test for continuous variables. Multivariable analysis was performed with a multiple logistic regression.  Results:   The median follow-up was 75 months. Univariate analysis showed that an IBF of less than 18 months was associated with aspirin nonuse (P<.0001), statin nonuse (P<.0001), anticoagulant nonuse (P=.0006), cardiovascular disease (P=.0008), and prostate-specific antigen (continuous) (P=.008) but not with Gleason score, age, RT dose, or T stage.

Material and methods:   From January 2008 to December 2010, 144 subjects, with an increased PSA value or with a suspect digital rectal examination, were enrolled. Transrectal grey-scale Ultrasound (US) and CD examination were performed in all patients. CD US was considered positive or negative on the basis of the presence or absence of vascular abnormality. Prostate biopsy was performed immediately after grey-scale and Doppler evaluation, with a mean of 10 core-biopsy for each patient as well as a selective biopsy of all US abnormal areas (hypoechoic lesion or CD abnormality areas).  Results:   PCa has been detected in 71 (49.3%) patients. 58 of the 71 patients had a hypoechoic area at US scan and 27 had a CD abnormality. The PSA value was < 4 ng/ml in 11 patients (Group 1), in 63 patients PSA ranged between 4 and 10 ng/ml (Group 2) and in 70 patients PSA was greater than 10 ng/ml (Group 3). The detection rate was 36.7, 36.5 and 62.8% respectively. In Group 1 we detected 5 hypoechoic areas and 4 CD abnormal areas. Moreover 6 of 11 patients had a positive DRE. In the Group 2, 20 patients were positive to DRE; we visualized 21 hypoechoic areas and 7 CD abnormality. In the Group 3, 38 patients had a positive DRE, with 32 hypoechoic areas and 16 CD abnormalities found. We obtained 1537 total bioptic cores, 1440 randomly from peripheral gland, 70 from hypoechoic areas and 27 from abnormal CD flow areas. The detection rate was 17.1, 65.7 and 22.2% respectively.

When nanoparticles interact with living cells, their spatial distribution is progressively modified by cellular activity, which tends to concentrate them into intracellular compartments, changing in turn their responsivity to physical stimuli. In this paper, we investigate the consequences of cellular uptake on the related magnetic properties and NMR relaxivity of iron oxide nanoparticles. The superparamagnetic behavior (field-dependent and temperature-dependent magnetization curves investigated by SQUID (Superconducting Quantum Interference Device) measurements) and nuclear magnetic relaxation dispersion (NMRD) R(1) profiles of citrate-coated maghemite nanoparticles (mean diameter 8 nm) were characterized in colloidal suspension and after being uptaken by several types of cells (tumor cells, stem cells and macrophages). The temperature-dependent magnetization as well as the NMRD profile were changed following cellular uptake depending on the stage of endocytosis process while the field-dependent magnetization at room temperature remained unchanged. Magnetic coupling between nanoparticles confined in cell lysosomes accounts for the modification in magnetic behavior, thereby reflecting the local organization of nanoparticles. NMR longitudinal relaxivity was directly sensitive to the intracellular distribution of nanoparticles, in line with Transmission Electron Microscopy TEM observations.

SPRY2 loss may functionally synergize with aberrant cellular signalling to drive PC and to promote treatment-resistant disease. Here, we report evidence for a positive feedback regulation of the ErbB-PI3K/AKT cascade by SPRY2 loss in in vitro as well as pre-clinical in vivo models and clinical PC. Reduction in SPRY2 expression resulted in hyper-activation of PI3K/AKT signalling to drive proliferation and invasion by enhanced internalization of EGFR/HER2 and their sustained signalling at the early endosome in a PTEN-dependent manner. This involved p38 MAPK activation by PI3K to facilitate clathrin-mediated ErbB receptor endocytosis. Finally, in vitro and in vivo inhibition of PI3K suppressed proliferation and invasion, supporting PI3K/AKT as a target for therapy particularly in patients with PTEN-haploinsufficient-, low SPRY2- and ErbB-expressing tumours. In conclusion, SPRY2 is an important tumour suppressor in PC since its loss drives the PI3K/AKT pathway via functional interaction with the ErbB system.""","""['Meiling Gao', 'Rachana Patel', 'Imran Ahmad', 'Janis Fleming', 'Joanne Edwards', 'Stuart McCracken', 'Kanagasabai Sahadevan', 'Morag Seywright', 'Jim Norman', 'Owen Sansom', 'Hing Y Leung']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""EMBO Mol Med""","""['Sprouty2, PTEN, and PP2A interact to regulate prostate cancer progression.', 'Regulation of EGFR trafficking and cell signaling by Sprouty2 and MIG6 in lung cancer cells.', 'MiR-592 Promotes Gastric Cancer Proliferation, Migration, and Invasion Through the PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK Signaling Pathways by Targeting Spry2.', 'Involvement of PI3K/Akt pathway in prostate cancer--potential strategies for developing targeted therapies.', 'Interplay Among PI3K/AKT, PTEN/FOXO and AR Signaling in Prostate Cancer.', 'Examining the Effects of Gestational Physical Activity and Hofbauer Cell Polarization on Angiogenic Factors.', 'Cyclocreatine Suppresses Creatine Metabolism and Impairs Prostate Cancer Progression.', 'The microdissected gene expression landscape of nasopharyngeal cancer reveals vulnerabilities in FGF and noncanonical NF-ÎºB signaling.', 'Aurora kinase blockade drives de novo addiction of cervical squamous cell carcinoma to druggable EGFR signalling.', 'TMEM52B suppression promotes cancer cell survival and invasion through modulating E-cadherin stability and EGFR activity.']"""

TLR4 has been shown to be highly expressed in prostate cancer cells and contributes to tumor cell survival and invasion. In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of TLR4 signaling in the chemoresistance of prostate cancer cells. We showed that ligation of TLR4 with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) abrogated docetaxel-induced growth suppression in PC-3 prostate cancer cells, with an increase in the half-maximal inhibitory concentration. Downregulation of TLR4 using small-interference RNA sensitized PC-3 cells to docetaxel-induced apoptosis as determined by annexin V staining and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage, which was coupled with increased Bax expression and decreased Bcl-2. TLR4 ligation resulted in a marked increase in the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) and Akt. The pretreatment with a PI3-K inhibitor LY294002 reduced LPS-mediated resistance to docetaxel, significantly decreasing the viability of PC-3 cells.

Alternatively, the method evaluated here, PSF-choice, can modify the PSF localization to reduce the contamination from adjacent lipids by conforming the signal response more closely to the desired MRSI voxel grid. This is done without increasing scan time or degrading SNR of important metabolites.

Expression differs between tumor and normal tissue in several malignancies. Most work has focused on tissue and cell expression with few reports of circulating miRNAs in colorectal cancer. Available biomarkers for colorectal cancer have limited sensitivity and specificity, thus there is a need for new markers.  Aims:   This study aimed to identify miRNAs that are differentially expressed in the blood of colorectal cancer patients compared to controls and to establish if this is specific to colorectal cancer and thus could be utilized as potential tumor markers.  Methods:   Blood samples were collected from 63 colorectal cancer patients and 45 controls. Expression of 7 target miRNAs (miR-143, miR-145, miR-21, miR-30a-3p, miR-31, miR-34a, and miR-92) was measured using RQ-PCR. Results were correlated with clinicopathological data and analyzed.

Objective:   The aim was to obtain a clinical score for prediction of survival after surgery.  Summary of background data:   Survival prognosis is important when deciding about treatment of patients with metastatic spinal cord compression. The criteria for identifying patients with prostate cancer who may benefit from surgical treatment are unclear.  Methods:   The study comprised 68 consecutive patients with prostate cancer operated for metastatic spinal cord compression at UmeÃ¥ University Hospital, Sweden. The indication for surgery was neurological deficit; 53 patients had hormone-refractory prostate cancer and 15 patients had previously untreated, hormone-naÃ¯ve prostate cancer. In 42 patients, posterior decompression was performed and 26 patients were operated with posterior decompression and stabilization.  Results:   A new score for prediction of survival was developed on the basis of the results of survival analyses. The score includes hormone status of prostate cancer, Karnofsky performance status, evidence of visceral metastasis, and preoperative serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA). The total scores ranged from 0 to 6. Three prognostic groups were formulated: group A (n = 32) with scores 0-1; group B (n = 23) with scores 2-4, and group C (n = 12) with scores 5-6. The median overall survival was 3 (0.3-20) months in group A, 16 (1.8-59) months in group B, and more than half (7 of 12) of patients were still alive in group C.  Conclusion:   We present a new prognostic score for predicting survival of patients with prostate cancer after surgery for metastatic spinal cord compression.

Recently, aberrant expression of LEDGF was found in prostate cancer (PC). Herein, we showed that LEDGF overexpression upregulated Hsp27 in PC cells, DU145, PC-3 and LNCaP and promoted antiapoptotic pathways in PCs. We found that these cells had higher abundance of Hsp27, which was correlated with the levels of LEDGF expression. Transactivation assay in DU145 cells revealed that transactivation of Hsp27 was related to the magnitude of LEDGF expression. Silencing of LEDGF in DU145 cells abrogated Hsp27 expression and inhibited stimulated cell proliferation, invasiveness and migration. These cells were arrested in S and G2 phase, and failed to accumulate cyclin B1, and showed increased apoptosis. Furthermore, LEDGF-depleted DU145 cells displayed elevated Bax and cleaved caspase 9 expression and reduced levels of Bcl2, Bcl-(XL). The activated survival pathway(s), ERK1/2 and Akt, were selectively decreased in these cells, which characteristically have lower tumorigenicity. Conversely, the depleted cells, when re-overexpressed with LEDGF or Hsp27, regained tumorigenic properties. Collectively, results reveal the involvement of LEDGF-mediated elevated expression of Hsp27-dependent survival pathway(s) in PC.

This pattern was confirmed by protein secretion data and correlated with high levels of anti-BKV L-Tag IgG. Furthermore, in PBMC from these PCa-bearing patients, L-Tag-derived peptides significantly expanded an IL-10-secreting CD4(+) CD25(+(high)) CD127(-) FoxP3(+) T cell population with an effector memory phenotype (CD103(+)) capable of inhibiting proliferation of autologous anti-CD3/CD28-triggered CD4(+) CD25(-) T cells.

Methods:   47 patients with t-PSA 4.0-10.0 ng/mL underwent gray scale, power Doppler TRUS and MFI examinations before ultrasound guided biopsies. Biopsies were performed at twelve sites in the base, the mid-gland and the apex of the prostate in each patient, when there was no abnormal ultrasound finding.

The examination protocol included assessment of a total score of the scales IPSS and QoL, parameters of uroflowmetry, total PSA, the size of the prostate, number of prostatic biopsies in a high PSA level. The removed adenomatous tissue was examined histologically. By a PSA level, all the patients were divided into 3 groups. Group 1 - 18 patients with a preoperative PSA level above 10 ng/ml, group 2 - 23 patients with a PSA level from 4 to 10 ng/ml, group 3 - 17 control patients with PSA under 4 ng/ml. Mean age of the examinees was 67.7 +/- 7, 68.7 +/- 7.7, 67.9 +/- 8.9 years (p>0.05), respectively. A mean PSA level was 20.9 (10.3-53), 6.6 (4.1-9.9) and 2.4 (1.3-3.9) ng/ml (p<0.01), respectively. A mean size of the prostate was larger in group 1 patients than in the controls: 127.3 (82-185) cm3 versus 100.7 (81-134) cm3 (p<0.05). Median of the number of transrectal multifocal biopsies was 2 (1-7), 1 (1-2) and 0 in groupl, 2 and 3, respectively.

Thus, the above protocol of examination of patients with prostatic adenoma including measurement of a PSA level, conduction of finger rectal examination followed by prostatic biopsy (transrectal saturation procedure is preferable) provides performance of adenomectomy without a risk to miss a clinically significant prostatic cancer even in a PSA level above 10 ng/ml.""","""['E I Veliev', 'S V Kotov', 'E N Golubtsova', 'A E Sokolov', 'A B Bogdanov', 'A Iu Avakian']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Urologiia""","""['Detection of prostatic carcinoma: the role of TRUS, TRUS guided biopsy, digital rectal examination, PSA and PSA density.', 'Prevalence of histological prostatitis in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia or adenocarcinoma of the prostate presenting without urinary retention.', 'Benefit of primary saturational biopsy in detection of localized prostatic cancer after radical prostatectomy.', 'The incidence of the variability of the free PSA/total PSA ratio on the early diagnosis of prostate cancer.', 'Prostatitis and serum prostate-specific antigen.']"""

Percent uptake, competitive binding, and internalization will evaluate the imaging agent in vitro. Preliminary biodistribution and imaging will be utilized for in vivo evaluation.  Results:   In vitro studies demonstrate that the radiotracer 99mTc-(CO)3-DTPA-CTT-54 exhibits increasing cellular uptake in the PSMA+ LNCaP cells over time. More importantly, it was found that 99mTc-(CO)3-DTPA-CTT-54 is rapidly internalized into LNCaP cells, presumably through the PSMA enzyme-inhibitor complex. In a pilot biodistribution study, increasing accumulation of the radiotracer in LNCaP xenografts was observed from 2 to 4 hr and significant clearance from non-target tissues.

The accuracy was benchmarked against interobserver variability.  Material and methods:   A total of 20 planning computed tomographs (CTs) and 10 cone-beam CTs (CBCTs) were selected for prostate, rectum, and bladder delineation. The images varied regarding to individual (age, body mass index) and setup parameters (contrast agent, rectal balloon, implanted markers). Automatically created contours with ABAS(Â®) and iPlan(Â®) were compared to an expert's delineation by calculating the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and conformity index.  Results:   Demo-atlases of both systems showed different results for bladder (DSC(ABAS) 0.86 Â± 0.17, DSC(iPlan) 0.51 Â± 0.30) and prostate (DSC(ABAS) 0.71 Â± 0.14, DSC(iPlan) 0.57 Â± 0.19).

Methods:   Human prostate cancer PC-3M cells were incubated with heparin 0.5 to 125 Î¼g/mL for 24 h. The proliferation of PC-3M cells was assessed by MTS assay. BrdU incoporation and Ki67 expression were detected using a high content screening (HCS) assay. The cell cycle and apoptosis of PC-3M cells were tested by flow cytometry. B16-F10-luc-G5 cardinoma cells were injected into the lateral tail vein of 6-week old male Balb/c nude mice and heparin 30 mg/kg was administered iv 30 min before and 24 h after injection. The metasis of B16-F10-luc-G5 cells was detected by bioluminescence assay. Activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and hemorheological parameters were measured on d 14 after injection of B16-F10-luc-G5 carcinoma cells in Balb/c mice. The global protein changes in PC-3M cells and frozen lung tissues from mice burdened with B16-F10-luc-G5 cells were determined by 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis and image analysis. The protein expression of vimentin and 14-3-3 zeta/delta was measured by Western blot. The mRNA transcription of vimentin, transforming growth factor (TGF)-Î², E-cadherin, and Î±(v)-integrin was measured by RT-PCR.  Results:   Heparin 25 and 125 Î¼g/mL significantly inhibited the proliferation, arrested the cells in G(1) phase, and suppressed BrdU incorporation and Ki67 expression in PC-3M cells compared with the model group. But it had no significant effect on apoptosis of PC-3M cells. Heparin 30 mg/kg markedly inhibits the metastasis of B16-F10-luc-G5 cells on day 8. Additionally, heparin administration maintained relatively normal red blood hematocrit but had no influence on APTT in nude mice burdened with B16-F10-luc-G5 cells. Thirty of down-regulated protein spots were identified after heparin treatment, many of which are related to tumor development, extracellular signaling, energy metabolism, and cellular proliferation. Vimentin and 14-3-3 zeta/delta were identified in common in PC-3M cells and the lungs of mice bearing B16-F10-luc-G5 carcinoma cells. Heparin 25 and 125 Î¼g/mL decreased the protein expression of vimentin and 14-3-3 zeta/delta and the mRNA expression of Î±(v)-integrin. Heparin 125 Î¼g/mL decreased vimentin and E-cadherin mRNA transcription while increased TGF-Î² mRNA transcription in the PC-3M cells, but the differences were not significant. Transfection of vimentin-targeted siRNA for 48 h significantly decreased the BrdU incoporation and Ki67 expression in PC-3M cells.

Three cases showed no perineurial proliferation (grade 0), 7 showed grade 1 proliferation, and 11 showed grade 2 proliferation. For comparison, we studied 17 cases of neoplasms with perineural invasion (PNI): 7 cutaneous neoplasms [squamous cell carcinomas (n = 3), cutaneous lymphoma, malignant melanoma, eccrine carcinoma, congenital neurotropic nevus (n = 1 each)] and 10 noncutaneous tumors [prostatic (n = 2), gastric (n = 2), and colonic (n = 2) adenocarcinomas; invasive ductal carcinoma of breast (n = 2); urothelial carcinoma of bladder (n = 1); and oral squamous cell carcinoma (n = 1)] with the same antibodies for perineurial cells. We found perineurial cell proliferation in 10 cases, 6 grade 1, and 4 grade 2. These perineurial cells were limited to the areas around the nerve fascicles. Most of the tumor was devoid of perineurial cells. Thus, it was interpreted more as a hyperplastic or reactive phenomenon than a neoplastic component. Claudin-1 was the most sensitive of the 3 markers that we used. Such proliferation was less intense in non-GCTs. In conclusion, proliferation of perineurial cells in GCTs and neoplasms with PNI is a common finding that had not been previously studied. It seems to be a non-neoplastic phenomenon.""","""['Francisco Izquierdo', 'Dimas SuÃ¡rez-Vilela', 'Emiliano Honrado']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Am J Dermatopathol""","""['Plexiform hybrid granular cell tumor/perineurioma: a novel variant of benign peripheral nerve sheath tumor with divergent differentiation.', 'Immunohistochemical demonstration of EMA/Glut1-positive perineurial cells and CD34-positive fibroblastic cells in peripheral nerve sheath tumors.', 'The normal and neoplastic perineurium: a review.', 'Hybrid schwannoma/perineurioma: clinicopathologic analysis of 42 distinctive benign nerve sheath tumors.', 'Perineural involvement: what does it mean?', 'Establishment of a Convenient System for the Culture and Study of Perineurium Barrier In Vitro.', 'Hybrid granular cell tumor/perineurioma.']"""

STAG2 is a gene that encodes a component of cohesion complex required for normal chromosomal segregation. Recently, somatic mutation of STAG2 gene and loss of STAG2 protein have been reported in glioblastoma, Ewing's sarcoma and melanoma. The aim of this study was to see whether such alterations of STAG2 are also common in other cancers. In this study, we analyzed STAG2 somatic mutation in 45 colorectal carcinomas (CRC), 45 gastric carcinomas (GC), 45 breast carcinomas, 45 non-small cell lung cancers and 45 prostate carcinomas (PCA) by single-strand conformation polymorphism. We analyzed also STAG2 protein expression in 100 GC, 103 CRC and 107 PCA by immunohistochemistry. STAG2 protein was well expressed in normal stomach, colon and prostate epithelial cells, while it was lost in 27% of GC, 23% of CRC and 30% of PCA. The loss of STAG2 was observed irrespective of subtypes, stages and grades of the cancers. However, we could not find any STAG2 mutations in these cancers. The loss of expression of STAG2 in GC, CRC and PCA tissues compared to their corresponding normal cells indicates that STAG2 loss is common in carcinomas as well. The data suggest also that loss of expression of STAG2, but not somatic mutation, might be responsible to STAG2 inactivation and is common in studied types of carcinomas.""","""['M S Kim', 'S S Kim', 'E M Je', 'N J Yoo', 'S H Lee']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Neoplasma""","""['Mutational and expressional analyses of SPOP, a candidate tumor suppressor gene, in prostate, gastric and colorectal cancers.', 'Somatic frameshift mutations of bone morphogenic protein receptor 2 gene in gastric and colorectal cancers with microsatellite instability.', 'Mutational analysis of MYC in common epithelial cancers and acute leukemias.', 'The role of STAG2 in bladder cancer.', 'Tissue, cell and stage specificity of (epi)mutations in cancers.', 'Suv420 enrichment at the centromere limits Aurora B localization and function.', 'Loss of Stag2 cooperates with EWS-FLI1 to transform murine Mesenchymal stem cells.', 'Regulatory signaling network in the tumor microenvironment of prostate cancer bone and visceral organ metastases and the development of novel therapeutics.', 'The Functional Role of Prostate Cancer Metastasis-related Micro-RNAs.', 'Fixation and Spread of Somatic Mutations in Adult Human Colonic Epithelium.']"""

At earlier stages, most diagnosed prostate cancers are responsive to androgen depletion treatment, yet, nearly all patients will eventually progress to metastatic androgen-independent prostate cancer (AIPC), which still has no effective therapeutic method or drug to deal with. 11'-Deoxyverticillin A (C42) belongs to the family of epipolythiodioxopiperazines (ETPs), an interesting class of fungal toxins that inhibit farnesyl transferase. Compounds holding such a property have been explored as putative anticancer agents. In this study, using PC3M cells, an AIPC cell line, we investigated the effect of the compound on apoptosis and explored the underlying mechanism. It revealed that C42 markedly enhanced the activity of caspase-3/7 and increased the accumulation of the cleaved PARP, all of which are the markers of apoptosis. It also revealed that C42 either decreased cell viability or inhibited the growth of PC3M cells. Moreover, we observed that the loss of cell viability and cell growth inhibition induced by C42 were both time- and dosage dependent. Taken together, we indicated that C42 can induce caspase-dependent apoptosis in AIPC cells, and the results presented here will broaden our knowledge about the molecular mechanisms by which C42 exerts its anticancer activity, and future work in this direction may provide valuable information in the development of these compounds into effective cancer therapeutic strategies against androgen-independent prostate cancer.""","""['Yingdi Shi', 'Yingqiu Zhang', 'Yangxiao Ni', 'Guoli Shi', 'Huaiyi Yang']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Sheng Wu Gong Cheng Xue Bao""","""[""PFKFB3 regulates 11'-deoxyverticillin A (C42)-induced autophagy and apoptosis in HeLa cells."", ""PARP and RIP 1 are required for autophagy induced by 11'-deoxyverticillin A, which precedes caspase-dependent apoptosis."", 'Î±-Santalol, a derivative of sandalwood oil, induces apoptosis in human prostate cancer cells by causing caspase-3 activation.', 'Induction of apoptosis and histone hyperacetylation by diallyl disulfide in prostate cancer cell line PC-3.', 'Tumor apoptosis induced by epoxide-containing piperazines, a new class of anti-cancer agents.']"""

Unknown to the pathologists, each carcinoma was shown twice, once before a background of a low grade, tubule-rich carcinoma and once before the background of a high grade, solid carcinoma. Eye tracking allowed to identify which nuclei the pathologists fixated during the 8 second projection period. For all 20 pathologists, nuclear grade assignment was significantly biased by tumor architecture. Pathologists tended to fixate on bigger, darker, and more irregular nuclei when those were projected before kigh grade, solid carcinomas than before low grade, tubule-rich carcinomas (and vice versa). However, the morphometric differences of the selected nuclei accounted for only 11% of the architecture-induced bias, suggesting that it can only to a small part be explained by the unconscious fixation on nuclei that ""match the expectation"".

However, the mechanism of action of RB remains unclear. In this study, we found that using PC3 and DU145 cells as models, RB inhibited phosphorylation levels of IÎºBÎ± and p65 subunit of NF-ÎºB in a time- and dosage-dependent manner. Detailed study revealed that RB blocked the nuclear translocation of p65 and its DNA binding activity, which correlated with suppression of NF-ÎºB-regulated proteins including Bcl-2, Bcl-x(L), cyclin D1 and survivin. NF-ÎºB reporter assay suggested that RB was able to inhibit both constitutive activated-NF-ÎºB and LPS (lipopolysaccharide)-induced activation of NF-ÎºB. Overexpression of RelA/p65 rescued RB-induced cell death, while knockdown of RelA/p65 significantly promoted RB-mediated inhibitory effect on cell proliferation, suggesting the crucial involvement of NF-ÎºB pathway in this event. We further analyzed antitumor activity of RB in in vivo study. In C57BL/6 mice carrying RM-1 homografts, RB inhibited tumor growth and triggered apoptosis mainly through suppressing NF-ÎºB activity in tumor tissues. Additionally, DNA microarray data revealed global changes in the gene expression associated with cell proliferation, apoptosis, invasion and metastasis in response to RB treatment. Therefore, our findings suggested that RB exerted its anti-tumor effect by targeting the NF-ÎºB pathway in PCa cells, and this could be a general mechanism for the anti-tumor effect of RB in other types of cancers as well.""","""['Yong-Qing Liu', 'Xiao-Yan Hu', 'Tao Lu', 'Yan-Na Cheng', 'Charles Y F Young', 'Hui-Qing Yuan', 'Hong-Xiang Lou']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['3-Formylchromone interacts with cysteine 38 in p65 protein and with cysteine 179 in IÎºBÎ± kinase, leading to down-regulation of nuclear factor-ÎºB (NF-ÎºB)-regulated gene products and sensitization of tumor cells.', 'Ursolic acid inhibits multiple cell survival pathways leading to suppression of growth of prostate cancer xenograft in nude mice.', 'Suppression of constitutive and tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB activation and induction of apoptosis by apigenin in human prostate carcinoma PC-3 cells: correlation with down-regulation of NF-kappaB-responsive genes.', 'Targeting nuclear factor-kappa B activation pathway by thymoquinone: role in suppression of antiapoptotic gene products and enhancement of apoptosis.', 'Targeting inflammatory pathways by triterpenoids for prevention and treatment of cancer.', 'Pharmacological Small Molecules against Prostate Cancer by Enhancing Function of Death Receptor 5.', 'Targeting Inflammatory Signaling in Prostate Cancer Castration Resistance.', ""Anticancer Potential of Lichens' Secondary Metabolites."", 'Impaired lipid metabolism markers to assess the risk of neuroinflammation in autism spectrum disorder.', 'Enhancement of cisplatin cytotoxicity by Retigeric acid B involves blocking DNA repair and activating DR5 in prostate cancer cells.']"""

We investigated here two 8q24 breast and colon cancer risk alleles in the close vicinity of the MYC gene for their role in the occurrence of distant metastases.  Methodology/principal findings:   A retrospective series of 449 patients affected with breast or colon adenocarcinoma was genotyped for the rs13281615 and/or rs6983267 SNPs. Statistical analyses were done using the survival package v2.30 in the R software v2.9.1. The two SNPs did not influence the development of distant metastases of colon cancer; rs6983267 showed a mild effect on breast cancer. However, this effect was greatly emphasized when considering inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) solely. Replicated on a larger and independent series of IBC the contribution of the genotype to the metastatic risk of IBC was found an independent predictor of outcome (p = 2e-4; OR 8.3, CI95:2.6-33).  Conclusions/significance:   Our study shows first that the monitoring of this specific germline variation may add a substantial tool for IBC prognostication, an aggressive disease that evolves towards distant metastases much more frequently than non-IBC and for which no reliable prognostic factor is available in medical practice.

Celastrol and Triptolide, two active components extracted from the Chinese herb Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F (known as Lei Gong Teng or Thunder of God Vine), have shown anti-tumor effects. Celastrol was identified as a natural 26 s proteasome inhibitor which promotes cell apoptosis and inhibits tumor growth. The effect and mechanism of Triptolide on prostate cancer (PCa) is not well studied. Here we demonstrated that Triptolide, more potent than Celastrol, inhibited cell growth and induced cell death in LNCaP and PC-3 cell lines. Triptolide also significantly inhibited the xenografted PC-3 tumor growth in nude mice. Moreover, Triptolide induced PCa cell apoptosis through caspases activation and PARP cleavage. Unbalance between SUMOylation and deSUMOylation was reported to play an important role in PCa progression. SUMO-specific protease 1 (SENP1) was thought to be a potential marker and therapeutical target of PCa. Importantly, we observed that Triptolide down-regulated SENP1 expression in both mRNA and protein levels in dose-dependent and time-dependent manners, resulting in an enhanced cellular SUMOylation in PCa cells. Meanwhile, Triptolide decreased AR and c-Jun expression at similar manners, and suppressed AR and c-Jun transcription activity. Furthermore, knockdown or ectopic SENP1, c-Jun and AR expression in PCa cells inhibited the Triptolide anti-PCa effects. Taken together, our data suggest that Triptolide is a natural compound with potential therapeutic value for PCa. Its anti-tumor activity may be attributed to mechanisms involving down-regulation of SENP1 that restores SUMOylation and deSUMOyaltion balance and negative regulation of AR and c-Jun expression that inhibits the AR and c-Jun mediated transcription in PCa.""","""['Weiwei Huang', 'Tiantian He', 'Chengsen Chai', 'Yuan Yang', 'Yahong Zheng', 'Pei Zhou', 'Xiaoxia Qiao', 'Bin Zhang', 'Zengzhen Liu', 'Junru Wang', 'Changhong Shi', 'Liping Lei', 'Kun Gao', 'Hewei Li', 'Sue Zhong', 'Libo Yao', 'Meng-Er Huang', 'Ming Lei']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Triptolide induces protective autophagy through activation of the CaMKKÎ²-AMPK signaling pathway in prostate cancer cells.', 'Synergistic anticancer effects of triptolide and celastrol, two main compounds from thunder god vine.', 'Triptolide inhibits human breast cancer MCF-7 cell growth via downregulation of the ERÎ±-mediated signaling pathway.', 'The main anticancer bullets of the Chinese medicinal herb, thunder god vine.', 'Immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory mechanisms of triptolide, the principal active diterpenoid from the Chinese medicinal herb Tripterygium wilfordii Hook. f.', 'The emerging roles of SUMOylation in the tumor microenvironment and therapeutic implications.', 'Triptolide increases resistance to bile duct ligation-induced liver injury and fibrosis in mice by inhibiting RELB.', 'Ubiquitin and Ubiquitin-like Proteins in Cancer, Neurodegenerative Disorders, and Heart Diseases.', 'SUMOylation and NEDDylation in Primary and Metastatic Cancers to Bone.', 'Therapeutic Potential of Certain Terpenoids as Anticancer Agents: A Scoping Review.']"""

The ATF3-AR interaction requires the leucine zipper domain of ATF3 that independently binds the DNA-binding and ligand-binding domains of AR, and the interaction prevents AR from binding to cis-acting elements required for expression of androgen-dependent genes while inhibiting the AR N- and C-terminal interaction. The functional consequences of the loss of ATF3 expression include increased transcription of androgen-dependent genes in prostate cancer cells that correlates with increased ability to grow in low-androgen-containing medium and increased proliferative activity of the prostate epithelium in ATF3 knockout mice that is associated with prostatic hyperplasia. Our results thus demonstrate that ATF3 is a novel repressor of androgen signaling that can inhibit AR functions, allowing prostate cells to restore homeostasis and maintain integrity in the face of a broad spectrum of intrinsic and environmental insults.""","""['Hongbo Wang', 'Ming Jiang', 'Hongmei Cui', 'Mengqian Chen', 'Ralph Buttyan', 'Simon W Hayward', 'Tsonwin Hai', 'Zhengxin Wang', 'Chunhong Yan']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Mol Cell Biol""","""['Edelfosine Promotes Apoptosis in Androgen-Deprived Prostate Tumors by Increasing ATF3 and Inhibiting Androgen Receptor Activity.', 'Botanical Formulation HX109 Ameliorates TP-Induced Benign Prostate Hyperplasia in Rat Model and Inhibits Androgen Receptor Signaling by Upregulating Ca2+/CaMKKÎ² and ATF3 in LNCaP Cells.', 'The CCAAT enhancer-binding protein-alpha negatively regulates the transactivation of androgen receptor in prostate cancer cells.', 'Androgen-selective gene regulation in the prostate.', 'Androgen action in the prostate gland.', 'The evolution and polymorphism of mono-amino acid repeats in androgen receptor and their regulatory role in health and disease.', 'Transient receptor potential vanilloid subtype 1 depletion mediates mechanical allodynia through cellular signal alterations in small-fiber neuropathy.', 'Omega-3 Fatty Acids DHA and EPA Reduce Bortezomib Resistance in Multiple Myeloma Cells by Promoting Glutathione Degradation.', 'ATF3 promotes the serine synthesis pathway and tumor growth under dietary serine restriction.', 'Male Breast Cancer-Immunohistochemical Patterns and Clinical Relevance of FASN, ATF3, and Collagen IV.']"""

The 17q24.3 locus harbors the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs1859962 that is statistically associated with prostate cancer (PCa). It defines a 130-kb linkage disequilibrium (LD) block that lies in an â¼2-Mb gene desert area. The functional biology driving the risk associated with this LD block is unknown. Here, we integrate genome-wide chromatin landscape data sets, namely, epigenomes and chromatin openness from diverse cell types. This identifies a PCa-specific enhancer within the rs1859962 risk LD block that establishes a 1-Mb chromatin loop with the SOX9 gene. The rs8072254 and rs1859961 SNPs mapping to this enhancer impose allele-specific gene expression. The variant allele of rs8072254 facilitates androgen receptor (AR) binding driving increased enhancer activity. The variant allele of rs1859961 decreases FOXA1 binding while increasing AP-1 binding. The latter is key to imposing allele-specific gene expression. The rs8072254 variant in strong LD with the rs1859962 risk SNP can account for the risk associated with this locus, while rs1859961 is a rare variant less likely to contribute to the risk associated with this LD block. Together, our results demonstrate that multiple genetic variants mapping to a unique enhancer looping to the SOX9 oncogene can account for the risk associated with the PCa 17q24.3 locus. Allele-specific recruitment of the transcription factors androgen receptor (AR) and activating protein-1 (AP-1) account for the increased enhancer activity ascribed to this PCa-risk LD block. This further supports the notion that an integrative genomics approach can identify the functional biology disrupted by genetic risk variants.""","""['Xiaoyang Zhang', 'Richard Cowper-Sal lari', 'Swneke D Bailey', 'Jason H Moore', 'Mathieu Lupien']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Genome Res""","""['Comprehensive functional annotation of 77 prostate cancer risk loci.', 'Three-tiered role of the pioneer factor GATA2 in promoting androgen-dependent gene expression in prostate cancer.', 'In-silico identification and functional validation of allele-dependent AR enhancers.', 'Androgen receptor enhancer usage and the chromatin regulatory landscape in human prostate cancers.', 'Systematic enrichment analysis of potentially functional regions for 103 prostate cancer risk-associated loci.', 'Systematic fine-mapping and functional studies of prostate cancer risk variants.', 'SNP-Target Genes Interaction Perturbing the Cancer Risk in the Post-GWAS.', 'Prostate Cancer Transcriptomic Regulation by the Interplay of Germline Risk Alleles, Somatic Mutations, and 3D Genomic Architecture.', 'The landscape of GWAS validation; systematic review identifying 309 validated non-coding variants across 130 human diseases.', 'An enhancer variant at 16q22.1 predisposes to hepatocellular carcinoma via regulating PRMT7 expression.']"""

Our previously reported cDNA microarray experiments identified PAG as a gene down-regulated in the high metastatic potential prostate cancer cell line PC-3M-1E8. In this study, we investigated the role of PAG in the proliferation, invasion and metastasis of prostate cancer cells and the underlying mechanisms. We confirmed that the expression of PAG at both the mRNA and protein levels was low in PC-3M-1E8 and DU145 cells compared to low metastatic potential prostate cancer cells PC-3M-2B4. In addition, we demonstrated that the reintroduction of PAG to PC-3M-1E8 and DU145 cells led to reduced proliferation through cell cycle arrest, decreased anchorage-independent growth and reduced invasion ability of tumor cells in vitro. This is the first report demonstrating that PAG inhibits the proliferation and invasion potential of prostate cancer cells via the interaction with RasGAP to recruit RasGAP to the cell membrane, where RasGAP hydrolyzes GTP to GDP, reduces the level of activated Ras, and ultimately suppresses the activation of ERK1/2, cyclin D1 and other effectors of the Ras signaling pathway. Morphologically, we observed that PAG could diminish the formation of pseudopodia on the cell surface and redistribute the intracellular F-actin in PC-3M-1E8 cells, which directly leads to the decreased invasion and metastasis potential of tumor cells. Taken together, these results suggest that PAG acts to inhibit the development and metastasis of prostate cancers and represents a novel therapeutic target for prostate cancer.""","""['Wenjuan Yu', 'Yuewei Wang', 'Miaozi Gong', 'Fei Pei', 'Jie Zheng']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Oncol Rep""","""['Screening of phosphoprotein associated with glycosphingolipid microdomains 1 (PAG1) by cDNA microarray and influence of overexpression of PAG1 on biologic behavior of human metastatic prostatic cancer cell line in vitro.', 'Effects of vimentin on invasion and metastasis of prostate cancer cell lines PC-3M-1E8 and PC-3M-2B4.', 'Influence of phosphoprotein associated with glycosphingolipid microdomains 1 on biologic behavior of human prostatic cancer cell line in-vitro.', 'The role of choline in prostate cancer.', 'Regulation of Ras signaling and function by plasma membrane microdomains.', 'Transmembrane adaptor protein PAG is a mediator of PD-1 inhibitory signaling in human T cells.', 'Ras and Wnt Interaction Contribute in Prostate Cancer Bone Metastasis.', 'Structural studies of UBXN2A and mortalin interaction and the putative role of silenced UBXN2A in preventing response to chemotherapy.', 'Combined treatment of PC-3 cells with ultrasound and microbubbles suppresses invasion and migration.']"""

Population estimates were derived from the 2001 and 2006 censuses.  Methods:   Cancer cases were combined from 1998 to 2007 for Inuit Nunangat and the rest of Canada. Age-standardised incidence rates were calculated for all site cancers and sub-sites by sex. Standardised rate ratios between these 2 areas were calculated for all site cancers and sub-sites.  Results:   The age-standardised incidence rate for all cancer sites (1998-2007) was 14% lower for the Inuit Nunangat male population and 29% higher for the female population by comparison to the rest of Canada. Cancers of the nasopharynx, lung and bronchus, colorectal, stomach (males), and kidney and renal pelvis (females), were elevated in the Inuit Nunangat population compared to the rest of Canada, whereas prostate and female breast cancers were lower in the Inuit Nunangat population.  Conclusions:   Cancers with potentially modifiable risk factors, such as buccal cavity and pharynx, nasopharynx, lung and bronchus, and colorectal cancer were elevated in the Inuit Nunangat population compared to the rest of Canada. Besides greater smoking prevalence within Inuit Nunangat by comparison to the rest of Canada, distinct socioeconomic characteristics between respective area populations including housing, and income may have contributed to incidence differentials.

The study sample consists of 1,169 Chinese Hans, comprising 483 patients and 686 healthy controls. Then in phase II, flanking SNPs of the successfully replicated SNPs in Phase I were genotyped and tested for association with prostate cancer to fine map those significant association signals.  Results:   We successfully replicated the association of rs13385191 (located in the C2orf43 gene, P = 8.60Ã10(-5)), rs12653946 (P = 1.33Ã10(-6)), rs1983891 (FOXP4, P = 6.22Ã10(-5)), and rs339331 (GPRC6A/RFX6, P = 1.42Ã10(-5)) with prostate cancer.

Variants in the promoter of the MSMB gene have been associated with the risk of prostate cancer (PCa) in several independent genome-wide association studies. Both MSMB and an adjacent gene, NCOA4, are subjected to transcriptional control via androgen response elements. The gene product of NCOA4 interacts directly with the androgen receptor as a co-activator to enhance AR transcriptional activity. Here, we provide evidence for the expression of full-length MSMB-NCOA4 fusion transcripts regulated by the MSMB promoter. The predominant MSMB-NCOA4 transcript arises by fusion of the 5'UTR and exons 1-2 of the MSMB pre-mRNA, with exons 2-10 of the NCOA4 pre-mRNA, producing a stable fusion protein, comprising the essential domains of NCOA4. Analysis of the splice sites of this transcript shows an unusually strong splice acceptor at NCOA4 exon 2 and the presence of Alu repeats flanking the exons potentially involved in the splicing event. Transfection experiments using deletion clones of the promoter coupled with luciferase reporter assays define a core MSMB promoter element located between -27 and -236 of the gene, and a negative regulatory element immediately upstream of the start codon.

Yet current therapies do not significantly improve the long-term survival of patients with distant metastasis. In this study, we investigated the role of the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Vav3 in prostate cancer progression and metastasis and found that Vav3 expression correlated positively with prostate cancer cell migration and invasion. Stimulation of the receptor tyrosine kinase EphA2 by ephrinA1 resulted in recruitment and tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav3, leading to Rac1 activation as well as increased migration and invasion in vitro. Reduction of Vav3 resulted in fewer para-aortic lymph nodes and bone metastasis in vivo. Clinically, expression of Vav3 and EphA2 was elevated in late-stage and metastatic prostate cancers. Among patients with stage IIB or earlier prostate cancer, higher Vav3 expression correlated with lower cumulative biochemical failure-free survival, suggesting that Vav3 may represent a prognostic marker for posttreatment recurrence of prostate cancer.

Post-HIFU biopsies were performed in 30 of these patients (67%) at mean 14.1 months (95% CI 11.7 to 16.5) follow-up, 22 due to rising PSA and eight as part of routine follow-up. Biopsies were examined for presence, distribution and extent of adenocarcinoma, Gleason scores, use of standard immunohistochemistry and ablative tissue changes were attributable to HIFU.  Results:   In post-HIFU biopsies performed for biochemical failure, 17/22 (77%) contained adenocarcinoma; 4/22 (18%) had higher post-HIFU Gleason score; 3/22 (14%) had newly recognised bilateral involvement; and 4/22 (18%) had higher percentage tissue involvement compared with pre-HIFU biopsies. Of cases without rising post-HIFU PSA, 2/8 (25%) routine follow-up biopsies contained adenocarcinoma. Stromal fibrosis was the commonest finding in non-tumour post-HIFU biopsy tissue (17/30, 57%) with coagulative necrosis occurring in fewer cases (4/30, 13%) and over a shorter follow-up interval than cases showing fibrosis (8.5 (0.2-16.8) vs 15.3 (11.5-19.1) months). Treatment effects in tumour cells precluding the assignment of Gleason scores or use of immunohistochemistry in post-HIFU biopsies were not identified.

Concern exists that MHC may adversely impact prostate health.  Objective:   The objective of the study was to determine the molecular impact of MHC on intraprostatic androgen concentrations and androgen action.  Design:   This was a single-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study.  Setting:   The study was conducted at an academic medical center.  Participants:   32 healthy men aged 25-55 yr participated in the study.  Intervention:   Interventions included placebo, daily transdermal testosterone (T) (T-gel), T-gel + depomedroxyprogesterone acetate (T+DMPA), or T-gel + dutasteride daily (T+D) for 12 wk, and prostate biopsy during treatment wk 10.  Main outcome measures:   Serum and prostate androgen concentrations and prostate epithelial-cell gene expression were measured.  Results:   Thirty men completed the study. Serum T levels were significantly increased in T-gel and T+D groups compared with baseline (P < 0.05) but were decreased with the addition of DMPA. Intraprostatic androgens were no different from placebo with T-gel treatment. Addition of DMPA to T resulted in 40% lower intraprostatic dihydrotestosterone (DHT) concentration (P = 0.0273 vs. placebo), whereas combining dutasteride with T resulted in a 90% decrease in intraprostatic DHT (P = 0.0012), 11-fold increased intraprostatic T (P = 0.0011), and 7-fold increased intraprostatic androstenedione (P = 0.0011). Significant differences in global or androgen-regulated prostate epithelial-cell gene expression were not observed. Androgen-regulated gene expression correlated with epithelial-cell androgen receptor and prostatic DHT in placebo, T-gel, and T+DMPA arms and with T and androstenedione levels in the T+D arm.

Herein, we report the synthesis and biological properties of 1:1:1 square-planar copper(II) complexes incorporating the dicarboxylate o-phthalate and 1,10-phenanthroline (1) or 2,2'-dipyridyl (2) ligands. Their broad-spectrum chemotherapeutic potential has been assessed at 24- and 96-h intervals, along with that of the clinical agent cisplatin, using breast (MCF-7), prostate (DU145), colon (HT29), and intrinsically cisplatin-resistant ovarian (SK-OV-3) human cancer cells. 1 represents a potent cytotoxic agent with IC(50) values ranging from 5.6 to 3.4Î¼M across all cell lines, including SK-OV-3.

DNA cleavage reactions using superhelical plasmid DNA, in the presence of exogenous reductant, l-ascorbic acid, revealed excellent agreement between double-stranded DNA scission capability and antitumoral IC(50) concentration. The presence of double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs) was confirmed within SK-OV-3 cancer cells using immunodetection of Î³-H2AX foci by confocal microscopy and flow cytometry, with complex 1 quantitatively producing superior numbers of DSBs compared with complex 2.

Androgens may affect prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, thereby influencing biopsy recommendations. Also, androgens may stimulate prostate growth at very low levels with no additional effects at higher levels (saturation model).  Objective:   To test whether androgens were associated with PCa risk in the placebo arm of a prospective study in which biopsies were performed regardless of PSA level.  Design, setting, and participants:   Of 8122 men in the Reduction by Dutasteride of Prostate Cancer Events (REDUCE) trial, 4073 men (50.1%) received placebo. Key entry criteria were PSA 2.5-10 ng/ml and one prior negative biopsy.  Intervention:   Per-protocol biopsies at 2 and 4 yr; for-cause biopsies at physician discretion.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Multivariable logistic regression was used to test the association between baseline log-transformed testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) levels and the risk of detecting either PCa or low-grade PCa (Gleason score <6) compared with high-grade PCa (Gleason score >7). In secondary analysis, we stratified the analysis by low baseline androgen levels (testosterone <10 nmol/l; DHT <0.76 nmol/l) compared with normal baseline androgen levels.  Results and limitations:   Of 4073 men, 3255 (79.9%) had at least one biopsy after randomization and were analyzed. Androgen levels tested continuously or by quintiles were generally unrelated to PCa detection or grade. PCa detection was similar among men with low compared with normal baseline testosterone levels (25.5% and 25.1%; p=0.831). In secondary analysis, higher testosterone levels at baseline were associated with higher PCa detection (odds ratio: 1.23; 95% confidence interval, 1.06-1.43; p=0.006) only if men had low baseline testosterone (<10nmol/l). For men with normal baseline testosterone (â¥10 nmol/l), higher testosterone levels at baseline were unrelated to PCa risk (p=0.33). No association was found for DHT and PCa (all p>0.85).

We aimed to assess the changing patterns of cancer according to varying levels of human development.  Methods:   We used four levels (low, medium, high, and very high) of the Human Development Index (HDI), a composite indicator of life expectancy, education, and gross domestic product per head, to highlight cancer-specific patterns in 2008 (on the basis of GLOBOCAN estimates) and trends 1988-2002 (on the basis of the series in Cancer Incidence in Five Continents), and to produce future burden scenario for 2030 according to projected demographic changes alone and trends-based changes for selected cancer sites.  Findings:   In the highest HDI regions in 2008, cancers of the female breast, lung, colorectum, and prostate accounted for half the overall cancer burden, whereas in medium HDI regions, cancers of the oesophagus, stomach, and liver were also common, and together these seven cancers comprised 62% of the total cancer burden in medium to very high HDI areas. In low HDI regions, cervical cancer was more common than both breast cancer and liver cancer. Nine different cancers were the most commonly diagnosed in men across 184 countries, with cancers of the prostate, lung, and liver being the most common. Breast and cervical cancers were the most common in women. In medium HDI and high HDI settings, decreases in cervical and stomach cancer incidence seem to be offset by increases in the incidence of cancers of the female breast, prostate, and colorectum. If the cancer-specific and sex-specific trends estimated in this study continue, we predict an increase in the incidence of all-cancer cases from 12Â·7 million new cases in 2008 to 22Â·2 million by 2030.  Interpretation:   Our findings suggest that rapid societal and economic transition in many countries means that any reductions in infection-related cancers are offset by an increasing number of new cases that are more associated with reproductive, dietary, and hormonal factors. Targeted interventions can lead to a decrease in the projected increases in cancer burden through effective primary prevention strategies, alongside the implementation of vaccination, early detection, and effective treatment programmes.

Methods and materials:   A total of 102 patients from the trial who recurred were analyzed at a median follow-up of 8.5 years. The patients were divided into 3 groups based on the timing of salvage HT: 57 patients had prostate-specific antigen (PSA)â¤10 ng/mL and absent distant metastases (group 1, early), 21 patients had PSA>10 ng/mL and absent distant metastases (group 2, late), and 24 patients had distant metastases (group 3, late). The endpoint analyzed was overall survival (OS) calculated from 2 different time points: date of enrolment in the trial (OS1) and date of initiation of salvage HT (OS2). Survival was estimated using Kaplan-Meier curves and a Cox regression model.  Results:   The OS1 differed significantly between groups (P<.0005): OS1 at 10 years was 78% in group 1, 42% in group 2, and 29% in group 3.

This may be highly bothersome with a major impact on the patient's quality of life. In the past, nocturia is seldom reported as a single, physiologically distinct endpoint, and little is known about its etiology. It is assumed that in addition to dose-volume parameters and patient- and therapy-related factors, a genetic component contributes to the development of radiation-induced damage. In this study, we investigated the association among dosimetric, clinical, and TGFÎ²1 polymorphisms and the development of acute radiation-induced nocturia in prostate cancer patients.  Methods and materials:   Data were available for 322 prostate cancer patients treated with primary or postoperative intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). Five genetic markers in the TGFÎ²1 gene (-800 G>A, -509 C>T, codon 10 T>C, codon 25 G>C, g.10780 T>G), and a high number of clinical and dosimetric parameters were considered. Toxicity was scored using an symptom scale developed in-house.  Results:   Radical prostatectomy (P<.001) and the presence of pretreatment nocturia (P<.001) are significantly associated with the occurrence of radiation-induced acute toxicity. The -509 CT/TT (P=.010) and codon 10 TC/CC (P=.005) genotypes are significantly associated with an increased risk for radiation-induced acute nocturia.  Conclusions:   Radical prostatectomy, the presence of pretreatment nocturia symptoms, and the variant alleles of TGFÎ²1 -509 C>T and codon 10 T>C are identified as factors involved in the development of acute radiation-induced nocturia.

Methods and materials:   This was an RT planning study of 8 patients with prostate cancer who had (11)C-choline PET scans prior to radical prostatectomy. Two contours were semiautomatically generated on the basis of the PET scans for each patient: 60% and 70% of the maximum standardized uptake values (SUV(60%) and SUV(70%)). Three IMRT plans were generated for each patient: PLAN(78), which consisted of whole-prostate radiation therapy to 78 Gy; PLAN(78-90), which consisted of whole-prostate RT to 78 Gy, a boost to the SUV(60%) to 84 Gy, and a further boost to the SUV(70%) to 90 Gy; and PLAN(72-90), which consisted of whole-prostate RT to 72 Gy, a boost to the SUV(60%) to 84 Gy, and a further boost to the SUV(70%) to 90 Gy. The feasibility of these plans was judged by their ability to reach prescription doses while adhering to published dose constraints. Tumor control probabilities based on PET scan-defined volumes (TCP(PET)) and on prostatectomy-defined volumes (TCP(path)), and rectal normal tissue complication probabilities (NTCP) were compared between the plans.  Results:   All plans for all patients reached prescription doses while adhering to dose constraints. TCP(PET) values for PLAN(78), PLAN(78-90), and PLAN(72-90) were 65%, 97%, and 96%, respectively. TCP(path) values were 71%, 97%, and 89%, respectively. Both PLAN(78-90) and PLAN(72-90) had significantly higher TCP(PET) (P=.002 and .001) and TCP(path) (P<.001 and .014) values than PLAN(78). PLAN(78-90) and PLAN(72-90) were not significantly different in terms of TCP(PET) or TCP(path). There were no significant differences in rectal NTCPs between the 3 plans.

We assessed the antitumor activity and safety of BMS-936558, an antibody that specifically blocks PD-1.  Methods:   We enrolled patients with advanced melanoma, non-small-cell lung cancer, castration-resistant prostate cancer, or renal-cell or colorectal cancer to receive anti-PD-1 antibody at a dose of 0.1 to 10.0 mg per kilogram of body weight every 2 weeks. Response was assessed after each 8-week treatment cycle. Patients received up to 12 cycles until disease progression or a complete response occurred.  Results:   A total of 296 patients received treatment through February 24, 2012. Grade 3 or 4 drug-related adverse events occurred in 14% of patients; there were three deaths from pulmonary toxicity. No maximum tolerated dose was defined. Adverse events consistent with immune-related causes were observed. Among 236 patients in whom response could be evaluated, objective responses (complete or partial responses) were observed in those with non-small-cell lung cancer, melanoma, or renal-cell cancer. Cumulative response rates (all doses) were 18% among patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (14 of 76 patients), 28% among patients with melanoma (26 of 94 patients), and 27% among patients with renal-cell cancer (9 of 33 patients). Responses were durable; 20 of 31 responses lasted 1 year or more in patients with 1 year or more of follow-up. To assess the role of intratumoral PD-1 ligand (PD-L1) expression in the modulation of the PD-1-PD-L1 pathway, immunohistochemical analysis was performed on pretreatment tumor specimens obtained from 42 patients. Of 17 patients with PD-L1-negative tumors, none had an objective response; 9 of 25 patients (36%) with PD-L1-positive tumors had an objective response (P=0.006).  Conclusions:   Anti-PD-1 antibody produced objective responses in approximately one in four to one in five patients with non-small-cell lung cancer, melanoma, or renal-cell cancer; the adverse-event profile does not appear to preclude its use. Preliminary data suggest a relationship between PD-L1 expression on tumor cells and objective response.

Consequently, cholesterol-lowering drugs such as statins are being evaluated in prostate cancer treatment. Furthermore, natural products such as betulin (from birch tree bark) and tocotrienol (a minor form of vitamin E) have been shown to lower cholesterol levels. Using these drugs and oxysterols, we have determined which aspects of cholesterol homoeostasis should be targeted in prostate cancer, e.g. cellular cholesterol levels are increased by the transcription factor SREBP-2 (sterol-regulatory-element-binding protein isoform 2), whereas LXR (liver X receptor) promotes cholesterol efflux. Whereas betulin exerted non-specific effects on cell viability, tocotrienols produced a strong direct correlation between SREBP-2 activity and cell viability. Mechanistically, tocotrienols lowered SREBP-2 activity by degrading mature SREBP-2 independently of the proteasome. In contrast, no correlation was seen between LXR activity and cell viability, implying that SREBP-2 is a better target than LXR for prostate cancer treatment. Lastly, androgen-dependent and -independent LNCaP cells were both sensitive to tocotrienols. Overall, this suggests that tocotrienols and other drugs targeting the SREBP-2 pathway are a potential therapeutic option for prostate cancer.""","""['James R Krycer', 'Lisa Phan', 'Andrew J Brown']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Biochem J""","""['Overexpression of a key regulator of lipid homeostasis, Scap, promotes respiration in prostate cancer cells.', 'Does changing androgen receptor status during prostate cancer development impact upon cholesterol homeostasis?', 'Taurine is a liver X receptor-Î± ligand and activates transcription of key genes in the reverse cholesterol transport without inducing hepatic lipogenesis.', 'Cholesterol accumulation in prostate cancer: a classic observation from a modern perspective.', 'Oxysterol receptors, AKT and prostate cancer.', 'New insights into lipid metabolism and prostate cancer (Review).', 'The Integration of Metabolomics with Other Omics: Insights into Understanding Prostate Cancer.', 'Cholesterol-Lowering Phytochemicals: Targeting the Mevalonate Pathway for Anticancer Interventions.', 'Cancer as a Metabolic Disorder.', 'The cholesterol pathway: impact on immunity and cancer.']"""

The low accuracy of prostate biopsy for Gleason grade determination is well known but its accuracy for bilateral or multifocal tumor has not been evaluated. The goal of this study was to assess the concordance between prostate biopsy and whole prostate specimen obtained after radical prostatectomy especially for bilateral and/or multifocal tumor.  Methods:   We retrospectively compared the pathological results of prostate biopsy cores to the prostate specimen in patients who underwent radical prostatectomy in our department between the 01/01/1999 and the 31/12/2008. The criteria analyzed were the Gleason score, tumor bilaterality or multifocality. The impact of the number of prostate biopsy cores was also analyzed.  Results:   Two hundred and five complete histological records were studied. Regarding the Gleason score overall concordance was 55%. In 38%, prostate biopsies downgraded the Gleason score. This concordance decreased with tumor differentiation (90.6% for Gleason 6 vs. 31% for Gleason greater than 7). For the tumor bilaterality, 78% of cancers affected both lobes at the definitive specimen analysis while only 49% were bilateral at prostate biopsies, achieving a concordance of 61%. Multifocal disease was observed in 36% at definitive pathology analysis with low concordance with prostate biopsies (36%). The number of biopsies increased the concordance for the Gleason score (60 to 81% for Gleason 7 and from 28 to 50% for Gleason greater than 7) and tumor location (44 to 70%).  Conclusion:   Pathological criteria and tumor mapping obtained from prostate biopsies were not very reliable especially when the tumor was poorly differentiated.

Methods:   We retrospectively evaluated the data from 2038 patients with a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level <10 ng/mL undergoing initial extended biopsy at our institutions. The DM history was determined by self-report and medication use. Multivariate analyses of DM for PCa risk and grade were done using logistic regression. Moreover, we examined whether these associations were modified by the body mass index using subgroup analyses (nonobese <25 kg/m(2) or obese â¥25 kg/m(2)) and interaction tests.

Limited data suggests that this hexapeptide could contribute to cancer development and/or progression.  Materials and methods:   Using the MTT reduction assay as an indicator of cell viability, and the bromodeoxyuridine incorporation assay as an indicator of cell proliferation, the influence of Angiotensin IV was evaluated on two human prostate cancer lines: androgen-dependent (LNCaP) and androgen-independent (DU-145). The potential effect of Angiotensin IV classic angiotensin receptors was examined by using the selective antagonists losartan and PD123319. Finally, the changes in expression levels of AT1 and AT2 receptors were compared, before and after angiotensin treatment.  Results:   Angiotensin IV caused significant changes in cell viability and proliferation in LNCaP cells but not in DU-145. It was found that AT2 receptor blocker (PD123319) was able to diminish the suppressor effect of Angiotensin IV on bromodeoxyuridine incorporation into the DNA of androgen-dependent prostate cancer cells. Simultaneously, it was reported that Angiotensin IV is the factor that modulates the density of AT1 and AT2 receptors in prostate cancer cells.  Conclusions:   These findings suggested that Angiotensin IV can modulate tumour cell proliferation in the early stage of androgen-dependent prostate cancer. The effect might be promoted by the change of the angiotensin receptor level.""","""['Kamila Dominska', 'Agnieszka W Piastowska-Ciesielska', 'Elzbieta Pluciennik', 'Agnieszka Lachowicz-Ochedalska', 'Tomasz Ochedalski']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Renin Angiotensin Aldosterone Syst""","""['Similarities and differences between effects of angiotensin III and angiotensin II on human prostate cancer cell migration and proliferation.', 'Angiotensin II up-regulates PAX2 oncogene expression and activity in prostate cancer via the angiotensin II type I receptor.', 'Angiotensin receptors in hormone-independent prostate cancer cell line DU145: presence of two variants of angiotensin type 1 receptor.', 'Pharmacology and new perspectives of angiotensin II receptor blocker in prostate cancer treatment.', 'The evaluation of involvement of angiotensin II, its receptors, and androgen receptor in endometrial cancer.', 'Association of a common genetic variant (insertion/deletion) in ACE gene with prostate cancer susceptibility in a Tunisian population.', 'Angiotensin II and Angiotensin Receptors 1 and 2-Multifunctional System in Cells Biology, What Do We Know?', 'The Impact of Ang-(1-9) and Ang-(3-7) on the Biological Properties of Prostate Cancer Cells by Modulation of Inflammatory and Steroidogenesis Pathway Genes.', 'Synthesis of 11C-labeled Sulfonyl Carbamates through a Multicomponent Reaction Employing Sulfonyl Azides, Alcohols, and 11CCO.', 'Effect of berberine on PPARÎ±-NO signalling pathway in vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation induced by angiotensin IV.']"""

In this phantom study, different sources contributing to the overall needle placement error of a MRI-guided robot for prostate biopsy have been identified, quantified and minimized to the possible extent.  Methods:   The overall needle placement error of the system was evaluated in a prostate phantom. This error was broken into two parts: the error associated with the robotic system (called 'before-insertion error') and the error associated with needle-tissue interaction (called 'due-to-insertion error'). Before-insertion error was measured directly in a soft phantom and different sources contributing into this part were identified and quantified. A calibration methodology was developed to minimize the 4-DOF manipulator's error. The due-to-insertion error was indirectly approximated by comparing the overall error and the before-insertion error. The effect of sterilization on the manipulator's accuracy and repeatability was also studied.  Results:   The average overall system error in the phantom study was 2.5 mm (STD = 1.1 mm). The average robotic system error in the Super Soft plastic phantom was 1.3 mm (STD = 0.7 mm). Assuming orthogonal error components, the needle-tissue interaction error was found to be approximately 2.13 mm, thus making a larger contribution to the overall error. The average susceptibility artifact shift was 0.2 mm. The manipulator's targeting accuracy was 0.71 mm (STD = 0.21 mm) after robot calibration. The robot's repeatability was 0.13 mm. Sterilization had no noticeable influence on the robot's accuracy and repeatability.  Conclusions:   The experimental methodology presented in this paper may help researchers to identify, quantify and minimize different sources contributing into the overall needle placement error of an MRI-guided robotic system for prostate needle placement. In the robotic system analysed here, the overall error of the studied system remained within the acceptable range.""","""['Reza Seifabadi', 'Nathan B J Cho', 'Sang-Eun Song', 'Junichi Tokuda', 'Nobuhiko Hata', 'Clare M Tempany', 'Gabor Fichtinger', 'Iulian Iordachita']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Int J Med Robot""","""['Robotic system for MRI-guided prostate biopsy: feasibility of teleoperated needle insertion and ex vivo phantom study.', 'CT-guided robotic needle biopsy of lung nodules with respiratory motion - experimental system and preliminary test.', 'Preclinical evaluation of an MRI-compatible pneumatic robot for angulated needle placement in transperineal prostate interventions.', 'Robotic systems for percutaneous needle-guided interventions.', 'MRI-guided and robotic-assisted prostate biopsy.', 'MRI Distortion Correction and Robot-to-MRI Scanner Registration for an MRI-Guided Robotic System.', 'An MR-Conditional Needle Driver for Robot-Assisted Spinal Injections: Design Modifications and Evaluations.', 'Differential Image Based Robot to MRI Scanner Registration with Active Fiducial Markers for an MRI-Guided Robotic Catheter System.', 'Initial phantom studies for an office-based low-field MR system for prostate biopsy.', 'In-Bore MRI-guided Prostate Biopsies in Patients with Prior Positive Transrectal US-guided Biopsy Results: Pathologic Outcomes and Predictors of Missed Cancers.']"""

Methods:   We extended our MRI-compatible pneumatic robot for needle placement to utilize its four degrees-of-freedom (4-DOF) mechanism with two parallel triangular structures and support transperineal prostate biopsies in a closed-bore magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner. The robot is designed to guide a needle toward a lesion so that a radiologist can manually insert it in the bore. The robot is integrated with navigation software that allows an operator to plan angulated needle insertion by selecting a target and an entry point. The targeting error was evaluated while the angle between the needle insertion path and the static magnetic field was between -5.7Â° and 5.7Â° horizontally and between -5.7Â° and 4.3Â° vertically in the MRI scanner after sterilizing and draping the device.  Results:   The robot positioned the needle for angulated insertion as specified on the navigation software with overall targeting error of 0.8 Â± 0.5mm along the horizontal axis and 0.8 Â± 0.8mm along the vertical axis. The two-dimensional root-mean-square targeting error on the axial slices as containing the targets was 1.4mm.

Previous studies have indicated that TGFÎ² isoforms may exert differential effects on cancer cells during different stages of the disease, however very little is known about the expression patterns and activity of the three isoforms in prostate cancer. Non-traditional signaling pathways including the PI3-Kinase have been associated with TGFÎ²-mediated effects on cancer cell invasion. In the present study, we have carried out expression analysis of TGFÎ² isoforms and signaling components in cell line models representing different stages of prostate cancer and studied the differential effects of specific isoforms on migratory and invasive behavior and induction of the PI3-kinase pathway. TGFÎ²1 and TGFÎ²3 were expressed in all cell lines, with TGFÎ²3 expression increasing in metastatic cell lines. Both TGFÎ²1 and TGFÎ²3 induced motility and invasive behavior in PC3 cells, however, TGFÎ²3 was significantly more potent than TGFÎ²1. TGFÎ²RI and Smad3 inhibitors blocked TGFÎ²1 and TGFÎ²3 induced motility and invasion. TGFÎ²3 caused a significant increase in pAKT(ser473) in PC3 cells and PI3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 blocked TGFÎ²3 induced migration, invasion and phosphorylation of AKT. Both TGFÎ²RI and Smad3 inhibitors blocked TGFÎ²3 induced pAKT(ser473). Based on these results, we conclude that TGFÎ²3 is expressed in metastatic prostate cancer cell lines and is involved in induction of invasive behavior in these cells.

The immunoproteasome is an alternative form of the constitutive proteasome that is expressed at high levels in cancer tissues, but not in most normal cells in the body.

Results:   A small molecule inhibitor of the immunoproteasome subunit LMP2, UK-101, induced apoptosis of PC-3 cells and resulted in significant inhibition (~50-60%) of tumour growth in vivo. Interestingly, UK-101 did not block degradation of IÎºBÎ± in PC-3 cells treated with TNF-Î±, suggesting that its mode of action may be different from that of general proteasome inhibitors, such as bortezomib, which block IÎºBÎ± degradation.  Conclusion:   These results strongly suggest that the immunoproteasome has important roles in cancer cell growth and thus provide a rationale for targeting the immunoproteasome in the treatment of prostate cancer.""","""['M Wehenkel', 'J-O Ban', 'Y-K Ho', 'K C Carmony', 'J T Hong', 'K B Kim']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Br J Cancer""","""['Molecular basis of the selectivity of the immunoproteasome catalytic subunit LMP2-specific inhibitor revealed by molecular modeling and dynamics simulations.', 'LMP2-specific inhibitors: chemical genetic tools for proteasome biology.', 'Characterization of the Interaction between the Matrix Protein of Vesicular Stomatitis Virus and the Immunoproteasome Subunit LMP2.', 'Immunoproteasome-selective and non-selective inhibitors: A promising approach for the treatment of multiple myeloma.', 'Inhibitors of the immunoproteasome: current status and future directions.', 'The dichotomous role of immunoproteasome in cancer: Friend or foe?', 'Suppression of prostate cancer and amelioration of the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment through selective immunoproteasome inhibition.', 'A Novel Mechanism of Immunoproteasome Regulation via miR-369-3p in Intestinal Inflammatory Response.', 'Site-Specific Proteasome Inhibitors.', 'The Functional and Mechanistic Roles of Immunoproteasome Subunits in Cancer.']"""

Additionally, it enables correct cancer localization in patients with known PCa under active surveillance to avoid misclassification on repeat biopsies. Nevertheless, suspicious lesions on MRI findings need verification by biopsy. The aim of the present study was to establish a standardized functional prostate MRI reporting scheme.  Methods:   Prostate MRI with T(2)-weighted images, T(1)-weighted images, diffusion-weighted imaging, and dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI of 56 consecutive patients were performed on a 3-T scanner. Patients with prior negative random transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided biopsy and continuous suspicion for PCa as well as patients under active surveillance were included. The MRI localization report of suspicious lesions followed a standardized scheme. TRUS-guided random biopsy with addition of targeted biopsy cores was performed afterwards based on the structured report.  Results:   Of the 56 patients, 18 had suspicious MRI findings and subsequently underwent repeat biopsy under guidance of the standardized localization scheme. PCa was documented in 72% (13/18).

These SNPs are local tagging markers for causal gene alterations. Consideration of candidate genes in the tagged regions would be facilitated by additional information on the particular pathomechanisms which contribute to the observed risk increase. In this study we test for an association of prostate cancer tagging SNPs with alterations in DNA repair capacity, a phenotype that is frequently involved in cancer predisposition. DNA repair capacity was assessed on blood lymphocytes from 128 healthy probands after ionizing irradiation. We used the micronucleus (MN) assay to determine the cellular DNA double-strand break repair capacity and flow cytometry to measure damage induced mitotic delay (MD). Probands were genotyped for a panel of 14 SNPs, each representing an independent prostate cancer risk locus previously identified by GWAS. Associations between germline variants and DNA repair capacity were found for the SNPs rs1512268 (8p21), rs6983267 (8q24) and rs10993994 (10q11). The most significant finding was an association of homozygous rs10993994 T-allele carriers with a lower MN frequency (p=0.0003) and also a decreased MD index (p=0.0353). Cells with prostate cancer risk alleles at rs10993994 seem to cope more efficiently with DNA double strand breaks (less MN) in a shorter time (decreased MD index). This intriguing finding imposes concern about the accuracy of repair, with respect to the cancer risk that is mediated by T genotypes. To date, MSMB (microseminoprotein Î²) is favored as the causal gene at the 10q11 risk locus, since it was the first candidate gene known to be expressionally altered by rs10993994. Based on the present observation, candidate genes from the contexts of DNA repair and apoptosis may be more promising targets for expression studies with respect to the rs10993994 genotype.""","""['Antje E Rinckleb', 'Harald M Surowy', 'Manuel Luedeke', 'Dominic Varga', 'Mark Schrader', 'Josef Hoegel', 'Walther Vogel', 'Christiane Maier']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""DNA Repair (Amst)""","""['Fine mapping association study and functional analysis implicate a SNP in MSMB at 10q11 as a causal variant for prostate cancer risk.', 'Prognostic significance of prostate cancer susceptibility variants on prostate-specific antigen recurrence after radical prostatectomy.', 'Fine mapping and functional analysis of a common variant in MSMB on chromosome 10q11.2 associated with prostate cancer susceptibility.', 'Systematic enrichment analysis of potentially functional regions for 103 prostate cancer risk-associated loci.', 'Single nucleotide polymorphisms in DNA repair genes and prostate cancer risk.', 'Prostate Cancer Genomics: Recent Advances and the Prevailing Underrepresentation from Racial and Ethnic Minorities.', 'MSMB variation and prostate cancer risk: clues towards a possible fungal etiology.', 'Genetics and genomics of prostate cancer.', 'Genome-wide association study reveals novel genetic determinants of DNA repair capacity in lung cancer.']"""

Both algorithms present, however, a particular difference in terms of dose calculation and report. Whereas dose from conventional methods is traditionally computed and reported as the water-equivalent dose (Dw), MC dose algorithms calculate and report dose to medium (Dm). In order to compare consistently both methods, the conversion of MC Dm into Dw is therefore necessary. This study aims to assess the effect of applying the conversion of MC-based Dm distributions to Dw for prostate IMRT plans generated for 6 MV photon beams. MC phantoms were created from the patient CT images using three different ramps to convert CT numbers into material and mass density: a conventional four material ramp (CTCREATE) and two simplified CT conversion ramps: (1) air and water with variable densities and (2) air and water with unit density. MC simulations were performed using the BEAMnrc code for the treatment head simulation and the DOSXYZnrc code for the patient dose calculation. The conversion of Dm to Dw by scaling with the stopping power ratios of water to medium was also performed in a post-MC calculation process. The comparison of MC dose distributions calculated in conventional and simplified (water with variable densities) phantoms showed that the effect of material composition on dose-volume histograms (DVH) was less than 1% for soft tissue and about 2.5% near and inside bone structures. The effect of material density on DVH was less than 1% for all tissues through the comparison of MC distributions performed in the two simplified phantoms considering water. Additionally, MC dose distributions were compared with the predictions from an Eclipse treatment planning system (TPS), which employed a pencil beam convolution (PBC) algorithm with Modified Batho Power Law heterogeneity correction. Eclipse PBC and MC calculations (conventional and simplified phantoms) agreed well (<1%) for soft tissues. For femoral heads, differences up to 3% were observed between the DVH for Eclipse PBC and MC calculated in conventional phantoms. The use of the CT conversion ramp of water with variable densities for MC simulations showed no dose discrepancies (0.5%) with the PBC algorithm. Moreover, converting Dm to Dw using mass stopping power ratios resulted in a significant shift (up to 6%) in the DVH for the femoral heads compared to the Eclipse PBC one. Our results show that, for prostate IMRT plans delivered with 6 MV photon beams, no conversion of MC dose from medium to water using stopping power ratio is needed. In contrast, MC dose calculations using water with variable density may be a simple way to solve the problem found using the dose conversion method based on the stopping power ratio.""","""['M Zarza-Moreno', 'I Cardoso', 'N Teixeira', 'A P Jesus', 'G Mora']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Phys Med""","""['Quantitative assessment of the accuracy of dose calculation using pencil beam and Monte Carlo algorithms and requirements for clinical quality assurance.', 'Clinical comparison of head and neck and prostate IMRT plans using absorbed dose to medium and absorbed dose to water.', 'Dose verification of an IMRT treatment planning system with the BEAM EGS4-based Monte Carlo code.', 'High-density dental implants and radiotherapy planning: evaluation of effects on dose distribution using pencil beam convolution algorithm and Monte Carlo method.', 'Report of the AAPM Task Group No. 105: Issues associated with clinical implementation of Monte Carlo-based photon and electron external beam treatment planning.', 'Influence of internal fixation systems on radiation therapy for spinal tumor.']"""

Methods and materials:   Plans were generated for 10 consecutive patients treated for high-risk prostate cancer with prophylactic whole pelvic radiation therapy (WPRT) using VMAT and HT. After WPRT, a sequential boost was delivered to the prostate. Plan quality was assessed according to the criteria of the International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements 83 report: the near-minimal (D98%), near-maximal (D2%), and median (D50%) doses; the homogeneity index (HI); and the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC). Beam-on time, integral dose, and several organs at risk (OAR) dosimetric indexes were also compared.  Results:   For WPRT, HT was able to provide a higher D98% than VMAT (44.3 Â± 0.3 Gy and 43.9 Â± 0.5 Gy, respectively; P=.032) and a lower D2% than VMAT (47.3 Â± 0.3 Gy and 49.1 Â± 0.7 Gy, respectively; P=.005), leading to a better HI. The DSC was better for WPRT with HT (0.89 Â± 0.009) than with VMAT (0.80 Â± 0.02; P=.002). The dosimetric indexes for the prostate boost did not differ significantly. VMAT provided better rectum wall sparing at higher doses (V70, V75, D2%). Conversely, HT provided better bladder wall sparing (V50, V60, V70), except at lower doses (V20). The beam-on times for WPRT and prostate boost were shorter with VMAT than with HT (3.1 Â± 0.1 vs 7.4 Â± 0.6 min, respectively; P=.002, and 1.5 Â± 0.05 vs 3.7 Â± 0.3 min, respectively; P=.002). The integral dose was slightly lower for VMAT.  Conclusion:   VMAT and HT provided very similar and highly conformal plans that complied well with OAR dose-volume constraints.

Methods and materials:   For 12 prostate patients, scanned beam carbon ion treatment plans were prepared using 2 lateral opposed beams and the raster scanning technique with different clinical target volume (CTV) to planning target volume (PTV) margins (2-10 mm). Internal target motion of 2-15 mm in anteroposterior (AP), superoinferior (SI), and left-to-right (LR) directions was simulated by displacing the CTV contours with respect to the computed tomography data. The plans were recalculated with and without target-based isocenter realignment and the CTV coverage was assessed.  Results:   For CTV shifts within the applied planning margin, the CI-98% is greater than 98.0%, both with and without isocenter realignment. Without realignment, because of the sharp lateral gradients, the CI-98% shows rapid fall as soon as the target shift exceeds the applied planning margin for all displacement directions. With isocenter realignment, the coverage improves notably for shifts in AP and SI directions and the CI-98% is restored to >95.0% for plans optimized with a 2-mm margin, >97% with a 3-mm margin, and >98% with larger margins. For large corrections, predominately in AP direction, cold spots in the CTV may occur. Their magnitude is dependent on the patients' individual anatomies.  Conclusions:   Within the physiological limits of internal prostate movement, target-based isocenter realignment results in improved CTV coverage for shifts in AP and SI directions exceeding the applied planning margin.

Higher Gleason score was the only clinicopathologic variable associated with higher PSA frequency in multivariable analysis for both the RP and RT groups (P value of .001 and .05, respectively). After adjustment for other covariates, the frequency of PSA tests during the first 2 years after RP did not increase the ability to detect BCR (hazard ratio, 1.00; 95% confidence interval, 0.84-1.19) or all-cause mortality (hazard ratio, 0.95; 95% confidence interval, 0.70-1.30) in the landmark analysis.  Conclusion:   Higher intensity of PSA surveillance during the 2 years after RP or RT did not improve earlier detection of BCR or survival.

We previously showed that targeted suppression of Hsp27 sensitizes cancer cells to hormone and chemotherapy. However, mechanisms by which Hsp27 confers cell treatment resistance are incompletely defined. Here, we report that Hsp27 protects human prostate cancer cells against proteotoxic stress induced by proteasome inhibition, and that Hsp27 silencing using siRNA or antisense (OGX-427) induced both apoptosis and autophagy through mechanisms involving reduced proteasome activity and induction of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. We found that autophagy activation protected against ER stress-induced cell death, whereas inhibition of autophagy activation following Hsp27 silencing using either pharmacologic inhibitors or atg3 silencing enhanced cell death. Importantly, cotargeting Hsp27 and autophagy by combining OGX-427 with the autophagy inhibitor, chloroquine, significantly delayed PC-3 prostate tumor growth in vivo. These findings identify autophagy as a cytoprotective, stress-induced adaptive pathway, activated following disruption of protein homeostasis and ER stress induced by Hsp27 silencing. Combinatorial cotargeting cytoprotective Hsp27 and autophagy illustrates potential benefits of blocking activation of adaptive pathways to improve treatment outcomes in cancer.""","""['Masafumi Kumano', 'Junya Furukawa', 'Masaki Shiota', 'Anousheh Zardan', 'Fan Zhang', 'Eliana Beraldi', 'Romina M Wiedmann', 'Ladan Fazli', 'Amina Zoubeidi', 'Martin E Gleave']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Ther""","""['Suppression of heat shock protein 27 using OGX-427 induces endoplasmic reticulum stress and potentiates heat shock protein 90 inhibitors to delay castrate-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Hsp27 Inhibition with OGX-427 Sensitizes Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Cells to Erlotinib and Chemotherapy.', 'Simultaneous inhibition of the ubiquitin-proteasome system and autophagy enhances apoptosis induced by ER stress aggravators in human pancreatic cancer cells.', 'New Insight into Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Therapy: The Potential Roles of Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress and Autophagy Mechanisms.', 'Inhibition of autophagy enhances heat-induced apoptosis in human non-small cell lung cancer cells through ER stress pathways.', 'Research progress on non-protein-targeted drugs for cancer therapy.', 'The endoplasmic reticulum stress response in prostate cancer.', 'miRNA-612 suppresses ovarian cancer cell tumorigenicity by downregulating NOB1.', 'Targeting autophagy in prostate cancer: preclinical and clinical evidence for therapeutic response.', 'HSP27 Protein Dampens Encephalomyocarditis Virus Replication by Stabilizing Melanoma Differentiation-Associated Gene 5.']"""

If non-organ-confined cancer and metastasis are categorically excluded by cross-sectional imaging using computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography CT (PET-CT) and bone scintigraphy, a prostate biopsy should be performed. Biopsy proven detection of recurrent or persisting prostate cancer after irradiation is essential prior to a salvage prostatectomy.

The authors examined PTEN and additional protein markers in primary tumors from patients with high-risk, localized prostate cancer who received adjuvant docetaxel in a prospective multicenter trial (TAX2501).  Methods:   Fifty-six of 77 patients enrolled in TAX2501 had primary prostatectomy specimens available for immunohistochemical analysis of PTEN, MYC, ERG, tumor protein p53 (p53), antigen KI-67 (Ki67), and phosphorylated forms of Akt, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and S6 ribosomal protein. Protocol-defined progression included a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level â¥ 0.4 ng/mL, radiologic/clinical recurrence, or death. Univariate and multivariable proportional hazards regression analyses were used to investigate the influence of PTEN status (and other protein markers) on progression-free survival (PFS).  Results:   In this exploratory, post hoc analysis, PTEN protein loss (vs presence) was observed in 61% of patients and was associated with lower preoperative PSA levels, higher clinical stage, lower Ki67 expression, the presence of p53, and the presence of ERG. In univariate analysis, the factors associated with PFS included Gleason sum, seminal vesicle invasion, PTEN status, MYC expression, and Ki67 expression. In multivariable analysis, only 3 variables emerged as independent prognostic factors for PFS: PTEN status (P = .035), MYC expression (P = .001), and Ki67 expression (P < .001). A prognostic model was constructed that incorporated clinical covariates as well as information on PTEN, MYC, and Ki67.  Conclusions:   The current results indicated that PTEN status, MYC expression, and Ki67 expression in primary tumor samples may predict PFS more accurately than clinical factors alone in men with high-risk prostate cancer who receive adjuvant docetaxel after prostatectomy.

Although various arterial spin labeling methods have been demonstrated previously in highly perfused organs, such as the brain and kidneys, the prospect of obtaining such measurements in the prostate is challenging because of the relatively low blood flow, long transit times, susceptibility-induced image distortion and local motion. However, despite these challenges, this study demonstrates that, with a whole-body transmit coil and external receiver array, global prostate perfusion can be measured with arterial spin labeling at 3 T.

Methods:   The PCBaSe Sweden database is based on the National Prostate Cancer Register (NPCR), which covers >96% of PCa cases. The authors estimated the prevalence and cumulative incidence of different cancers before and after PCa diagnosis in 72,613 men according to PCa treatment and disease stage in PCBaSe and their matched comparison cohort of men who were free of PCa.  Results:   In total, 6829 men were diagnosed with another primary cancer before their PCa diagnosis, including 138 men at the time of PCa diagnosis and 5230 men were diagnosed after PCa diagnosis. Cancer of the bladder or colon and nonmelanoma of the skin were the 3 most frequently observed cancers before and after PCa diagnosis. At the time of PCa diagnosis, the prevalence of these 3 cancers was 1.94% for bladder cancer, 1.08% for colon cancer, and 1.08% for nonmelanoma skin cancer, compared with 1.30%, 0.96%, and 1.03%, respectively, for the matched comparison cohort. Five years after PCa diagnosis, the difference in incidence proportion between PCa men and their comparison cohort was 7 â° (95% CI, 5.6 â°-8.5 â°), 1.3 â° (0 â°-2.6 â°), and 1.6 â° (0.6 â°-2.6 â°) for these 3 cancers, respectively. From a uro-oncologic point of view, it is interesting to note that the prevalence of kidney cancer at the time of PCa diagnosis was 0.42% compared with 0.28% for the matched comparison cohort.

Survivin, an inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) family member, mediates resistance to cancer chemotherapy particularly in prostate cancers. Therefore, development of anticancer agents targeting mitochondria and survivin is a potential strategy.  Method:   Cell proliferation was examined by sulforhodamine B, CFSE staining, and clonogenic assays. Mitochondrial membrane potential (ÎÎ¨(m) ) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) were detected by flow cytometric analysis. Protein expression was detected by Western blot. RNA levels were examined by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay. Overexpression of constitutively active Akt was also used in this study.  Results:   Ardisianone, a natural benzoquinone derivative, displayed anti-proliferative and apoptotic activities against human hormone-refractory prostate cancer cells (HRPC), PC-3, and DU-145. Ardisianone dramatically induced mitochondrial damage, identified by downregulation of Bcl-2 family proteins, ROS production, and loss of ÎÎ¨(m) . Ardisianone also inhibited Akt and mTOR/p70S6K pathways and induced a fast downregulation of survivin, leading to activation of mitochondria-involved caspase cascades. Overexpression of constitutively active Akt partly rescued ardisianone-mediated apoptotic signaling cascades. Furthermore, a long-term treatment of ardisianone caused an increase of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, upregulation of cIAP1 and cIAP2, and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF)-mediated caspase-independent apoptosis.  Conclusions:   The data suggest that the ardisianone induces apoptosis in human prostate cancers through mitochondrial damage stress, leading to the inhibition of mTOR/p70S6K pathway, downregulation of Bcl-2 family members, degradation of survivin, and activation of caspase cascades. The data provide evidence supporting that ardisianone is a potential anticancer agent against HRPCs.""","""['Chia-Chun Yu', 'Ping-Jung Wu', 'Jui-Ling Hsu', 'Yunn-Fang Ho', 'Lih-Ching Hsu', 'Yu-Jia Chang', 'Hsun-Shuo Chang', 'Ih-Sheng Chen', 'Jih-Hwa Guh']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Methoxychalcone induces cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis in human hormone-resistant prostate cancer cells through PI 3-kinase-independent inhibition of mTOR pathways.', 'Benzyl isothiocyanate (BITC) induces G2/M phase arrest and apoptosis in human melanoma A375.S2 cells through reactive oxygen species (ROS) and both mitochondria-dependent and death receptor-mediated multiple signaling pathways.', 'The roles of AIF and Endo G in the apoptotic effects of benzyl isothiocyanate on DU 145 human prostate cancer cells via the mitochondrial signaling pathway.', 'Mitochondria, reactive oxygen species and cadmium toxicity in the kidney.', 'The role of survivin for radiation oncology: moving beyond apoptosis inhibition.', 'Activation of multiple proteolysis systems contributes to acute cadmium cytotoxicity.', 'Antileukemic Natural Product Induced Both Apoptotic and Pyroptotic Programmed Cell Death and Differentiation Effect.', 'Enhancing the Efficacy of Glutamine Metabolism Inhibitors in Cancer Therapy.', 'The Role of the ER-Induced UPR Pathway and the Efficacy of Its Inhibitors and Inducers in the Inhibition of Tumor Progression.', 'Anti-Cancer Natural Products and Their Bioactive Compounds Inducing ER Stress-Mediated Apoptosis: A Review.']"""

They hypothesize that the qGS can improve prostate cancer risk stratification and help prevent the overtreatment of patients with clinically indolent tumors.  Methods:   The qGS was applied to patients in the University of California San Francisco urologic oncology database with tumors determined to have a GS of 7 on prostate biopsy or final pathology after radical prostatectomy (RP). Using multivariable logistic regression, Cox proportional hazards regression, receiver operating characteristic (ROC), and decision curve analyses, the ability of qGS to predict pathological GS and the risk of disease recurrence after RP was assessed.  Results:   A total of 225 men were included in the analysis of biopsy specimens and 618 men were included in the assessment of RP specimens. Compared with traditional Gleason scoring, the qGS improved concordance between biopsy and pathological GS on decision curve and ROC analyses (area under the curve ROC curve, 0.79 vs 0.71). On regression analysis, the qGS of biopsy specimens was found to be significantly associated with pathological grade after RP (hazard ratio [HR], 1.78; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.49-2.12) and the qGS of RP specimens was significantly associated with the risk of biochemical disease recurrence after RP (HR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.04-1.24).  Conclusions:   The qGS, a simple modification of the current Gleason system, appears to improve the correlation between biopsy and pathological GS, as well as the prediction of biochemical disease recurrence after RP. This scoring system may allow more men to pursue active surveillance, thereby avoiding the morbidity of prostate cancer treatment modalities.""","""['Adam C Reese', 'Janet E Cowan', 'Jonathan S Brajtbord', 'Catherine R Harris', 'Peter R Carroll', 'Matthew R Cooperberg']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Cancer""","""['Re: the quantitative Gleason score improves prostate cancer risk assessment.', 'The ability of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) density to predict an upgrade in Gleason score between initial prostate biopsy and prostatectomy diminishes with increasing tumour grade due to reduced PSA secretion per unit tumour volume.', 'Prostate cancer grading: the effect of stratification of needle biopsy Gleason Score 4 + 3 as high or intermediate grade.', 'Radical prostatectomy represents an effective treatment in patients with specimen-confined high pathological Gleason score prostate cancer.', 'Prostatectomy pathology findings in an active surveillance population.', 'What Are the Predictive Factors for Gleason Score Upgrade following RP?', 'Evaluating the Outcomes of Active Surveillance in Grade Group 2 Prostate Cancer: Prospective Results from the Canary PASS Cohort.', 'Application of Artificial Intelligence/Machine Vision & Learning for the Development of a Live Single-cell Phenotypic Biomarker Test to Predict Prostate Cancer Tumor Aggressiveness.', '(Dis)concordance of comorbidity data and cancer status across administrative datasets, medical charts, and self-reports.', 'Tailoring Intensity of Active Surveillance for Low-Risk Prostate Cancer Based on Individualized Prediction of Risk Stability.', 'Percent Gleason pattern 4 in stratifying the prognosis of patients with intermediate-risk prostate cancer.']"""

Our aim was to simultaneously quantify the expression levels of PCA3 and TMPRSS2:ERG in a panel of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), normal prostate adjacent to PCa (NP) and PCa tissue samples, to provide a rational basis for the understanding of the false-positive and false-negative results of the urine assays.  Methods:   The tissue samples were carefully histopathologically characterized to obtain homogeneous groups. The mRNA was isolated, transcribed into cDNA and the relative expressions of PCA3 and TMPRSS2:ERG were measured using a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. The expression levels of PCA3 and TMPRSS2:ERG were compared between the different groups.  Results:   We included 48 BPH, 32 NP, and 48 PCa. The PCA3 expression levels progressively increased from BPH to NP (3 times) and finally to PCa (30 times). There were one false-positive sample and seven false-negative samples. The TMPRSS2:ERG gene fusion was found in 8.3% of the BPH, 15.6% of the NP, and 50% of the PCa samples. The use of TMPRSS2:ERG in the PCA3 negative cases allowed diagnosis of four of the seven false-negative samples and added one false-positive, but we had to define a cut-off value to avoid eight false-positive results.  Conclusions:   Considering tissue expression of the markers, most of the false-negative results of the PCA3 test were corrected by TMPRSS2:ERG (57%) and the combination of both had a higher sensitivity for PCa diagnosis.

Of the 52 miRNAs, only 10 were equally affected by the two treatment modalities in the cancer compartment. Twenty-six of the 52 genes (50%) showed AR binding sites in their proximity in either VCaP or LNCaP cell lines. Forty-seven miRNAs were differentially expressed in TMPRSS2:ERG fusion positive compared with fusion negative cases.

Certain volatile compounds were also confirmed by positive chemical ionization and NMR spectra. Further, the volatile oil demonstrated good DPPH radical scavenging activity and antioxidant capacity. Kumquat volatile oil at 200 ppm concentration exhibited 55 %, 61 %, and 63.4 % inhibition of human prostate cancer (LNCaP) cell proliferation at 24, 48, and 72 h, respectively, by cell count assays. Significant increases in expression of bax/bcl2 and p53 proteins confirmed that volatile oil induces apoptosis. In addition, inhibition of inflammatory markers such as NF-ÎºB and Cox-2 was observed.

Twelve analogs (5-12, 15, 16, 19, and 20) are conjugates of curcumin (1) or methyl curcumin (2) with a flutamide- or bicalutamide-like moiety. Two compounds (22 and 23) are C4-mono- and difluoro-substituted analogs of dimethyl curcumin (DMC, 21). Among the newly synthesized conjugates compound 15, a conjugate of 2 with a partial bicalutamide moiety, was more potent than bicalutamide alone and essentially equipotent with 1 and 2 against both prostate tumor cell lines with IC(50) values of 41.8 Î¼M (for LNCaP) and 39.1 Î¼M (for PC-3). A cell morphology study revealed that the cytotoxicity of curcumin analogs or curcumin-anti-androgen conjugates detected from both prostate cancer cell lines might be due to the suppression of pseudopodia formation.

Methods and materials:   From 2003-2009, 15 patients underwent MRI/magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) planning for salvage brachytherapy (psPPI, I-125 [n=14; 144 Gy]; Pd-103 [n=1; 125 Gy]) without hormone therapy. Full dose was prescribed to areas of recurrence and underdosage, without entire prostate implantation. Limiting urethral and rectal toxicity was prioritized. Follow-up was from salvage date to prostate-specific antigen (PSA) concentration failure (Phoenix criteria = nadir + 2.0; ASTRO = 3 consecutive rises), recurrence, distant metastases, or last follow-up PSA level. Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as no PSA failure or biopsy-proven recurrence without all-cause mortality. Toxicity was scored using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0.  Results:   At salvage, median age was 68 years, and PSA concentration was 3.5 ng/mL (range, 0.9-5.6 ng/mL). Abnormal MRI/MRS findings were evident in 40% of patients. Biopsy-proven recurrences consisted of a single focus (80%) or 2 foci (20%). At recurrence, Gleason score was 6 (67%) or â¥7 (27%). Median interval between initial and salvage implantation was 69 months (range, 28-132 months). psPPI planning characteristics limited doses to the rectum (mean V100 = 0.5% [0.07 cc]) and urethra (V100 = 12% [0.3 cc]). At median follow-up (23.3 months; range, 8-88 months), treatment failure (n=2) resulted only in localized recurrence; both patients underwent second psPPI with follow-up PSA tests at 12 and 26 months, resulting in 0.6 and 0.7 ng/mL, respectively. American Society for Radiation Oncology PFS rates at 1, 2, and 3 years were 86.7%, 78.4%, and 62.7%, respectively, with 5 patients for whom treatment failed (n=3 with negative transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy results). Phoenix PFS rates at 1, 2, and 3 years were 100%, 100%, and 71.4%. 73%, respectively; achieved PSA nadir of <0.5 ng/mL; and 47% of patients had a nadir of <0.1 ng/mL. Treatment-related toxicity was minimal, with no operative interventions, fistulas, or other grade â¥3 gastrointestinal (GI)/genitourinary (GU) toxicity. Thirteen percent had grade 1 GI and 33% had grade 2 GU toxicities. Postsalvage, 20% of patients had no erectile dysfunction, 67% of patients had medication-responsive erectile dysfunction, and 13% of patients had erectile dysfunction refractory to medication.  Conclusions:   Focal psPPI with MR-planning in highly selected patients is feasible with short-term control comparable to conventional salvage, with less toxicity.

Aim:   An updated audit of prostate safety from the UK Androgen Study was carried out to analyze the incidence of PCa during long-term TRT.  Main outcome measures:   Diagnosis of PCa in men receiving TRT, by serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing and digital rectal examination (DRE), and its relation to different testosterone preparations.  Methods:   One thousand three hundred sixty-five men aged 28-87 (mean 55) years with symptomatic androgen deficiency and receiving TRT have been monitored for up to 20 years. All patients were prescreened for PCa by DRE and PSA along with endocrine, biochemical, hematological, and urinary profiles at baseline and every 6 months. Abnormal findings or rising PSA were investigated by transrectal ultrasound and prostate biopsy. The data were compared for the four different testosterone preparations used in TRT, including pellet implants, Restandol, mesterolone, and Testogel.  Results:   Fourteen new cases of PCa were diagnosed at one case per 212 years treatment, after 2,966 man-years of treatment (one case per 212 years). Time to diagnosis ranged from 1 to 12 years (mean 6.3 years). All tumors were clinically localized and suitable for potentially curative treatment. Initiating testosterone treatment had no statistically significant effect on total PSA, free PSA or free/total PSA ratio, and any initial PSA change had no predictive relationship to subsequent diagnosis of cancer.  Conclusions:   The incidence of PCa during long-term TRT was equivalent to that expected in the general population. This study adds to the considerable weight of evidence that with proper clinical monitoring, testosterone treatment is safe for the prostate and improves early detection of PCa. Testosterone treatment with regular monitoring of the prostate may be safer for the individual than any alternative without surveillance.""","""['Mark R Feneley', 'Malcolm Carruthers']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""J Sex Med""","""['Prostate-specific antigen changes and prostate cancer in hypogonadal men treated with testosterone replacement therapy.', 'Influence of demographic factors and biochemical characteristics on the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response to testosterone replacement therapy.', 'Outcomes of Prostate Biopsy in Men with Hypogonadism Prior or During Testosterone Replacement Therapy.', 'The effect of testosterone replacement therapy on prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Testosterone and the prostate.', 'Voiding function improves under long-term testosterone treatment (TTh) in hypogonadal men, independent of prostate size.', 'Clinical efficiency of combination therapy using testosterone replacement therapy, phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors and Kampo herbal medicine for eugonadal patients with late-onset hypogonadism syndrome.', 'Testosterone Therapy in Relation to Prostate Cancer in a U.S. Commercial Insurance Claims Database.', 'The effects of testosterone replacement therapy on the prostate: a clinical perspective.', 'Testosterone treatment and the risk of aggressive prostate cancer in men with low testosterone levels.']"""

Aim:   The aim of this study was to compare the effect of radical prostatectomy (RP) delay on postoperative functional outcomes and mortality in a North American population-based cohort.  Methods:   Overall, 17,153 men treated with RP for non-metastatic clinical stage T1-2, low-grade PCa between years 1995 and 2005 within the U.S. Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Medicare-linked database were abstracted.  Main outcome measures:   The effect of treatment delay (from PCa diagnosis to RP of >3 months) on pathological upstaging at surgery (â¥pT3) and postoperative functional outcomes (urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction) was examined using logistic regression analyses. The 10-year PCa mortality rates were computed using cumulative incidence rates.  Results:   Overall, 2,576 (15%) patients underwent RP > 3 months after diagnosis. A treatment delay of >3 months was associated with a 24% and 33% higher rate of erectile dysfunction diagnosis and procedure, respectively (both P â¤ 0.001). Treatment delay was also associated with 6% higher rate of urinary incontinence procedure (P = 0.01). Furthermore, a dose-response effect was detected with respect to increasing durations of RP delay (â¤3 vs. 3-5 vs. 5-9 vs. â¥9 months) the rates of erectile dysfunction and urinary incontinence diagnoses/procedures. Treatment delay was not associated with pathological upstaging and PCa mortality.  Conclusions:   Customarily, the timing of RP following biopsy is dictated by tumor aggressiveness.

What's known on the subject? and What does the study add? Over the past decade, minimally invasive laparoscopic radical prostatectomy and more recently robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy have been introduced and have proven equally effective compared with open surgery in terms of mid-term cancer control and complication rates. Because long-term data is lacking, open prostatectomy is still considered the 'gold standard' by some authors, who argue that minimally invasive approaches have to measure up to the excellent long-term results of open surgery. This study represents one of the largest series (1845 patients) of minimally invasive radical prostatectomy with extended follow-up (11.3 years) and detailed data on oncological outcome and postoperative incontinence. It therefore supplies previously lacking information on these details for minimally invasive prostate surgery and provides important information for patient counselling.  Objective:   â¢ To investigate biochemical recurrence (BCR) rates and data on postoperative incontinence in a large laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (LRP) cohort with extended follow-up.  Materials and methods:   â¢ BCR and independent predictors of BCR were identified using Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analysis of 1845 patients who underwent LRP from 1999 to 2007. â¢ Urinary incontinence was evaluated by pads per day and stratified as follows: 0-1 pad: no incontinence; 2-3 pads: mild incontinence; and â¥ 3 pads: severe incontinence.  Results:   â¢ Organ-confined disease, extraprostatic extension, seminal vesicle invasion and lymph node metastasis were present in 71.3%, 20.5%, 6.7% and 3.2% of patients, respectively. The positive surgical margin rate was 29.2%. â¢ Postoperatively, 74.9% of the patients were continent, while 9.2% had mild and 15.9% severe incontinence. â¢ The mean follow-up was 5 years with a maximum follow-up of 11.3 years. â¢ There were 51 overall deaths and six deaths from prostate cancer. The 5-year, 8-year and 10-year BCR-free survival rates were 83.9%, 78.6% and 75.6%, respectively. â¢ On univariate analyses preoperative D'Amico risk classification, pathological tumour stage, postoperative Gleason sum and surgical margin status were predictors of BCR (P < 0.001). â¢ On multivariable analysis, D'Amico classification, Gleason sum (P < 0.001), postoperative tumour stage (P < 0.001), nodal status (P < 0.001) and surgical margin status (P = 0.002) were independent predictors of BCR.

We investigated the relationship between HMGB1 expression and the characteristics of prostate cancer, and also evaluated the significance of HMGB1 as a prognostic factor for biochemical recurrence-free survival after radical prostatectomy.  Objective:   â¢ To investigate high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) expression in human prostate cancer (PC) cell lines and its prognostic significance after radical prostatectomy (RP).

Epigenetic biomarkers have proven useful, exhibiting frequent and abundant inactivation of tumor suppressor genes through such mechanisms. An epigenetic, multiplex PCR test for prostate cancer diagnosis could provide physicians with better tools to help their patients. Biomarkers like GSTP1, APC and RASSF1 have demonstrated involvement with prostate cancer, with the latter two genes playing prominent roles in the field effect. The epigenetic states of these genes can be used to assess the likelihood of cancer presence or absence.  Results:   An initial test cohort of 30 prostate cancer-positive samples and 12 cancer-negative samples was used as basis for the development and optimization of an epigenetic multiplex assay based on the GSTP1, APC and RASSF1 genes, using methylation specific PCR (MSP). The effect of prostate needle core biopsy sample volume and age of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples was evaluated on an independent follow-up cohort of 51 cancer-positive patients. Multiplexing affects copy number calculations in a consistent way per assay. Methylation ratios are therefore altered compared to the respective singleplex assays, but the correlation with patient outcome remains equivalent. In addition, tissue-biopsy samples as small as 20 Î¼m can be used to detect methylation in a reliable manner. The age of FFPE-samples does have a negative impact on DNA quality and quantity.  Conclusions:   The developed multiplex assay appears functionally similar to individual singleplex assays, with the benefit of lower tissue requirements, lower cost and decreased signal variation. This assay can be applied to small biopsy specimens, down to 20 microns, widening clinical applicability. Increasing the sample volume can compensate the loss of DNA quality and quantity in older samples.""","""['Leander Van Neste', 'Joseph Bigley', 'Adam Toll', 'GaÃ«tan Otto', 'James Clark', 'Paul DelrÃ©e', 'Wim Van Criekinge', 'Jonathan I Epstein']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""BMC Urol""","""['Clinical validation of an epigenetic assay to predict negative histopathological results in repeat prostate biopsies.', 'Evaluation of GSTP1 and APC methylation as indicators for repeat biopsy in a high-risk cohort of men with negative initial prostate biopsies.', 'Risk score predicts high-grade prostate cancer in DNA-methylation positive, histopathologically negative biopsies.', 'GSTP1 methylation in cancer: a liquid biopsy biomarker?', 'The epigenetic promise for prostate cancer diagnosis.', 'Expression of hsv1-miR-H18 and hsv2-miR-H9 as a field defect marker for detecting prostate cancer.', 'Tissue-Based Biomarkers for the Risk Stratification of Men With Clinically Localized Prostate Cancer.', 'Methylation Dynamics of RASSF1A and Its Impact on Cancer.', 'Genomic DNA Methylation-Derived Algorithm Enables Accurate Detection of Malignant Prostate Tissues.', 'Evaluation of an Epigenetic Assay for Predicting Repeat Prostate Biopsy Outcome in African American Men.']"""

All had completed their initial treatment. In the present study, 771 compliers were categorized into four groups of localized or locally advanced PCa related to the treatment they completed: (i) no treatment; (ii) radical prostatectomy (RP); (iii) radiotherapy (RAD) without hormones; and (iv) RAD with hormone therapy of 3-24 months duration. Measurement of AEs was restricted to function, using selected items from the 50-item Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite and the Brief Sexual Function Inventory among others, whereas global QoL was measured with the 12-item short-form health survey. National prescription data enabled assessment of adjuvant hormone application and EDmed use.  Results:   Men who had undergone RP reported more urinary incontinence (24%) than the other treatment groups, but had the lowest level of moderate/severe urinary irritative-obstructive symptoms. Men from the 'no treatment' group had the highest level of moderate/severe irritative-obstructive urinary symptoms. Men who had undergone RAD reported higher levels of irritative intestinal symptoms and faecal leakage compared with the RP group and the no treatment group. In all treatment groups, poor sexual drive and poor erectile function were common AEs, with men treated with RP reporting the highest prevalence of poor erectile function (89%). Presence of irritative-obstructive urinary symptoms and poor sexual drive were independently associated with low global QoL in multivariate analyses. Fifty percent of the study group had used EDmed after treatment start, but only 47% of them were still using EDmed at the time of the survey. Use of EDmed was not significantly associated with global QoL.  Conclusions:   PCa survivors after curative treatment, but also patients without any anticancer therapy, report high levels of urinary and sexual AEs. Irritative-obstructive urinary symptoms and poor sexual drive were significantly associated with low global QoL, whereas erectile function and use of EDmed were not.""","""['Anne E Kyrdalen', 'Alv A Dahl', 'Eivor Hernes', 'Milada Cvancarova SmÃ¥stuen', 'Sophie D FossÃ¥']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Re: A National study of adverse effects and global quality of life among candidates for curative treatment for prostate cancer.', 'Long-term morbidity and quality of life in patients with localized prostate cancer undergoing definitive radiotherapy or radical prostatectomy.', 'Population-based study of long-term functional outcomes after prostate cancer treatment.', 'Association Between Radiation Therapy, Surgery, or Observation for Localized Prostate Cancer and Patient-Reported Outcomes After 3 Years.', 'Epidemiology of urinary incontinence in prostate cancer.

Epidemiological studies have linked the consumption of fruits and vegetables to a reduced risk of prostate cancer, and small fruits are particularly rich sources of many active phytochemical stilbenes, such as pterostilbene. As a constituent of small fruits such as grapes, berries, and their products, pterostilbene is under intense investigation as a cancer chemopreventive agent. Using the p53 wild type LNCaP and p53 null PC3 cells, we found that treatment with pterostilbene resulted in dose-dependent inhibition of cellular proliferation, which suggested that the interaction of pterostilbene with the p53 might not fully explain its inhibitory effect on proliferation. In this study, we found that pterostilbene activated AMPK in both p53 positive and negative human prostate cancer cells. Pterostilbene-activated AMPK decreased the activity and/or expression of lipogenic enzymes, such as fatty acid synthase (FASN) and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC). Interestingly, the resolution between apoptosis and growth arrest following AMPK activation is greatly influenced by p53 status. In p53 positive LNCaP cells, pterostilbene blocked the progression of cell cycle at G1 phase by inducing p53 expression and further up-regulating p21 expression. However, pterostilbene induced apoptosis in p53 negative PC3 cells. Our results suggest that pterostilbene may be a functional chemopreventive agent and that dietary exposure to pterostilbene would be helpful for antiprostate cancer activity.""","""['Victor Chia-Hsiang Lin', 'Ya-Chu Tsai', 'Jia-Ni Lin', 'Ling-Ling Fan', 'Min-Hsiung Pan', 'Chi-Tang Ho', 'Jiumn-Yih Wu', 'Tzong-Der Way']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""J Agric Food Chem""","""['EGCG inhibits protein synthesis, lipogenesis, and cell cycle progression through activation of AMPK in p53 positive and negative human hepatoma cells.', 'Pterostilbene induces apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in human gastric carcinoma cells.', 'Indole-3-carbinol (I3C) induced cell growth inhibition, G1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in prostate cancer cells.', 'Biological/chemopreventive activity of stilbenes and their effect on colon cancer.', 'Potential Chemopreventive Role of Pterostilbene in Its Modulation of the Apoptosis Pathway.', 'Synthesis, In Vitro, and In Vivo Investigations of Pterostilbene-Tethered Analogues as Anti-Breast Cancer Candidates.', 'Pterostilbene-Mediated Inhibition of Cell Proliferation and Cell Death Induction in Amelanotic and Melanotic Melanoma.', 'Timosaponin A3 Inhibits Palmitate and Stearate through Suppression of SREBP-1 in Pancreatic Cancer.', 'Inhibitory effect of polyphenols (phenolic acids, lignans, and stilbenes) on cancer by regulating signal transduction pathways: a review.', 'Pterostilbene in Cancer Therapy.']"""

Material and method:   103 patients were treated curatively (RAD), 94 postoperatively (POST-OP). The mean age was higher in RAD group (72.6 years, range 56.4-85.1) than in POST-OP group (65.4 years, 43.9-77) (p < 0.0001). According to NCCN prognostic classification 13 (12%) patients was low risk, 48 (47%) intermediate risk and 42 (41%) high risk in RAD group. In POST-OP group 13 (14%) patients were low risk, 37 (40%) intermediate risk and 44 (46%) high risk. Hormone Therapy (HT) was administered in 98 patients (95%) in RAD and in 45 patients (47.8%) in POST-OP. Patients were treated with a three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT). In RAD 15 (15%) were alive with disease (AWD), 5 (5%) dead of disease (DOD) and 10 (10%) dead of other cause (DOC); in POST-OP 14 (14.8%) were AWD, 2 (2%) DOD and 3 (3%) DOC. The prescription dose was 80 Gy in 2-Gy fractions in the RAD group, and 70 Gy in 2-Gy fractions in the POST-OP, respectively.  Results:   No biochemical or clinical relapse was found in low risk patients in RAD group and 1 relapse in POST-OP group. The largest number of relapses occurred and in intermediate-high risk in RAD (39%) and POST-OP group (33%).

Because obesity may be a risk factor for prostate cancer, we investigated proliferative effects of adipocytes-derived hormone leptin on human prostate cancer cells and assessed the role of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway in mediating these actions. Material and Methods. Three human prostate cancer cell lines were treated with increasing doses of recombinant leptin. Cell growth was measured under serum-free conditions using a spectrophotometric assay. Further, Western blotting was applied to detect the phosphorylation of an ERK1/2, and a specific inhibitor of MAPK (PD98059; 40 Î¼M) was used. Results. In both androgen-resistant cell lines DU145 and PC-3, cell growth was dose-dependently increased by leptin after 24 hrs and 48 hrs of incubation, whereas leptin's proliferative effects on androgen-sensitive cell line LNCaP was less pronounced. Further, leptin caused dose-dependent ERK1/2 phosphorylation in both androgen-resistant cell lines, and pretreatment of these cells with PD98059 inhibited these responses. Conclusions. Leptin may be a potential link between obesity and risk of progression of prostate cancer.

In a rat model, chronic ZD induces an inflammatory gene signature that fuels ESCC development. microRNAs regulate gene expression and are aberrantly expressed in cancers. Here we investigated whether chronic ZD (23 weeks) also induces a protumorigenic microRNA signature. Using the nanoString technology, we evaluated microRNA profiles in ZD esophagus and six additional tissues (skin, lung, pancreas, liver, prostate and peripheral blood mononuclear cells [PBMC]). ZD caused overexpression of inflammation genes and altered microRNA expression across all tissues analyzed, predictive of disease development. Importantly, the inflammatory ZD esophagus had a distinct microRNA signature resembling human ESCC or tongue SCC miRNAomes with miR-31 and miR-21 as the top-up-regulated species. Circulating miR-31 was also the top-up-regulated species in PBMCs. In ZD esophagus and tongue, oncogenic miR-31 and miR-21 overexpression was accompanied by down-regulation of their respective tumor-suppressor targets PPP2R2A and PDCD4. Importantly, esophageal miR-31 and miR-21 levels were directly associated with the appearance of ESCC in ZD rats, as compared with their cancer-free Zn-sufficient or Zn-replenished counterparts. In situ hybridization analysis in rat and human tongue SCCs localized miR-31 to tumor cells and miR-21 to stromal cells. In regressing tongue SCCs from Zn-supplemented rats, miR-31 and miR-21 expression was concomitantly reduced, establishing their responsiveness to Zn therapy.

With the advent of high-throughput transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq), the problem of identifying structural alterations in the transcriptome is now attracting significant attention. In this article, we introduce two novel algorithmic formulations for identifying transcriptomic structural variants through aligning transcripts to the reference genome under the consideration of such variation. The first formulation is based on a nucleotide-level alignment model; a second, potentially faster formulation is based on chaining fragments shared between each transcript and the reference genome. Based on these formulations, we introduce a novel transcriptome-to-genome alignment tool, Dissect (DIScovery of Structural Alteration Event Containing Transcripts), which can identify and characterize transcriptomic events such as duplications, inversions, rearrangements and fusions. Dissect is suitable for whole transcriptome structural variation discovery problems involving sufficiently long reads or accurately assembled contigs.  Results:   We tested Dissect on simulated transcripts altered via structural events, as well as assembled RNA-Seq contigs from human prostate cancer cell line C4-2. Our results indicate that Dissect has high sensitivity and specificity in identifying structural alteration events in simulated transcripts as well as uncovering novel structural alterations in cancer transcriptomes.

This study examined potential oncogenic functions of Î²-PDGFR ligands PDGF B and PDGF D, using nonmalignant prostate epithelial cells engineered to overexpress these ligands. In our models, PDGF D induced cell migration and invasion more effectively than PDGF B in vitro. Importantly, PDGF D supported prostate epithelial cell tumorigenesis in vivo and showed increased tumor angiogenesis compared with PDGF B. Autocrine signaling analysis of the mitogen-activated protein kinase and phosphoinositide 3-kinase pathways found PDGF D-specific activation of the c-jun-NH2-kinase (JNK) signaling cascade. Using short hairpin RNA and pharmacologic inhibitors, we showed that PDGFD-mediated phenotypic transformation is Î²-PDGFR and JNK dependent. Importantly, we made a novel finding of PDGF D-specific increase in the shedding and activation of the serine protease matriptase in prostate epithelial cells. Our study, for the first time to our knowledge, showed ligand-specific Î²-PDGFR signaling as well as PDGF D-specific regulation of matriptase activity and its spatial distribution through shedding.

Methods:   This randomized, multi-center, double-blind phase II, dose-exploring trial randomized men with a rising PSA and without metastases to receive 1 or 3 g of POMx, stratified by baseline PSADT and Gleason score. Patients (104) were enrolled and treated for up to 18 months. The intent-to-treat (ITT) population was 96% white, with median age 74.5 years and median Gleason score 7.

In response, PAK4 phosphorylates LIM kinase 1 (LIMK1) in an HGF-dependent manner in metastatic prostate carcinoma cells. PAK4 overexpression is known to induce increased cell migration speed but the requirement for kinase activity has not been established. We have used a panel of PAK4 truncations and mutations in a combination of overexpression and RNAi rescue experiments to determine the requirement for PAK4 kinase activity during carcinoma cell motility downstream of HGF. We find that neither the kinase domain alone nor a PAK4 mutant unable to bind Cdc42 is able to fully rescue cell motility in a PAK4-deficient background. Nevertheless, we find that PAK4 kinase activity and associated LIMK1 activity are essential for carcinoma cell motility, highlighting PAK4 as a potential anti-metastatic therapeutic target. We also show here that overexpression of PAK4 harbouring a somatic mutation, E329K, increased the HGF-driven motility of metastatic prostate carcinoma cells. E329 lies within the glycine-rich loop region of the kinase. Our data suggest that E329K mutation leads to a modest increase in kinase activity, conferring resistance to competitive ATP inhibitors in addition to promoting cell migration.

Although endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced upregulation and retrotranslocation of cytoplasmic CLU (presecretory (psCLU) and secreted (sCLU) forms) has been linked to its anti-apoptotic properties, mechanisms mediating these processes remain undefined. Here, we show using human prostate cancer cells that GRP78 (Bip) associates with CLU under ER stress conditions to facilitate its retrotranslocation and redistribution to the mitochondria. Many ER stress inducers, including thapsigargin, MG132 or paclitaxel, increased expression levels of GRP78 and CLU, as well as post-translationally modified hypoglycosylated CLU forms. ER stress increased association between GRP78 and CLU, which led to increased cytoplasmic CLU levels, while reducing sCLU levels secreted into the culture media. GRP78 stabilized CLU protein and its hypoglycosylated forms, in particular after paclitaxel treatment. Moreover, subcellular fractionation and confocal microscopy with CLUGFP indicated that GRP78 increased stress-induced CLU retrotranslocation from the ER with co-localized redistribution to the mitochondria, thereby reducing stress-induced apoptosis by cooperatively stabilizing mitochondrial membrane integrity. GRP78 silencing reduced CLU protein, but not mRNA levels, and enhanced paclitaxel-induced cell apoptosis. Taken together, these findings reveal novel dynamic interactions between GRP78 and CLU under ER stress conditions that govern CLU trafficking and redistribution to the mitochondria, elucidating how GRP78 and CLU cooperatively promote survival during treatment stress in prostate cancer.""","""['N Li', 'A Zoubeidi', 'E Beraldi', 'M E Gleave']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['Clusterin protects hepatocellular carcinoma cells from endoplasmic reticulum stress induced apoptosis through GRP78.', 'Clusterin is a critical downstream mediator of stress-induced YB-1 transactivation in prostate cancer.', 'GRP78 and Raf-1 cooperatively confer resistance to endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced apoptosis.', 'Chapter 4: Regulation of Clusterin activity by calcium.', 'Clusterin as a therapeutic target.', 'Partial Inhibition of Complex I Restores Mitochondrial Morphology and Mitochondria-ER Communication in Hippocampus of APP/PS1 Mice.', 'The clusterin connectome: Emerging players in chondrocyte biology and putative exploratory biomarkers of osteoarthritis.', 'The Benefit of Optimal Dietary Lipid Level for Black Seabream Acanthopagrus schlegelii Juveniles under Low-Salinity Environment.', 'Mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum membrane: Overview and inextricable link with cancer.', 'Glycosylated clusterin species facilitate AÎ² toxicity in human neurons.']"""

Slopes â¤ 2.0 pg/ml/month are associated with reduced risk for prostate cancer recurrence. However, an indicator based on measurement at multiple time points, calculation of slope, and relation of slope to a binary cutoff may be subject to effects of analytical imprecision and sampling time variation. We performed simulation studies to determine the presence and magnitude of such effects.  Design and methods:   Using data from a two-site precision study and a multicenter clinical trial of 304 men, we performed simulation studies to assess whether analytical imprecision and sampling time variation can drive misclassifications or classification switching of patients with stable disease or recurrence.  Results:   Analytical imprecision related to expected PSA values in a stable disease population results in â¤1.2% misclassifications. For populations with recurrent disease, an analysis taking into account correlation between sampling time points demonstrates that classification switching across the 2.0 pg/ml/month cutoff occurs at a rate â¤11%. In the narrow region of overlap between populations, classification switching maximizes at 12.3%. Lastly, sampling time variation across a wide range of scenarios results in 99.7% retention of proper classification for stable disease patients with linear slopes up to the 75th percentile of the distribution.

Its introduction in clinical practice to supplement low specificity of prostate specific antigen (PSA) can improve CaP diagnosis and follow-up. However, before its introduction, it is necessary to validate the method of PCA3 detection in distinct geographic populations.  Objectives:   Our aim was to describe for the first time in Latin America, the application of the PROGENSA PCA3 assay for PCA3 detection in urine in Chilean men and its utility for CaP diagnosis in men with an indication of prostate biopsy.  Materials and methods:   Sixty-four Chilean patients (mean age, 64 years) with indication of prostate biopsy because of elevated PSA and/or suspicious digital rectal examination (DRE) were prospectively recruited. PCA3 scores were assessed from urine samples obtained after DRE, before biopsy, and compared with PSA levels and biopsy outcome.  Results:   The median PSA value and mean PCA3 score were 5.8 ng/ml and 31.7, respectively. Using a cutoff PCA3 score of 35, the sensitivity and specificity for detecting CaP were 52% and 87%, respectively. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis showed an area under the curve of 0.77 for PCA3 and 0.57 for PSA, for the same group of patients.

The trial and the self-help materials have been adapted from a previous RCT, which showed that a cognitive behavioural intervention reduced the self-reported problem-rating of hot flushes in women with menopausal symptoms, and in women undergoing breast cancer treatment. We hypothesize that guided self-help will be more effective than usual care in reducing HF/NS problem-rating at post treatment assessment.  Methods/design:   Seventy men who are undergoing treatment for prostate cancer and who have been experiencing more than ten HF/NS weekly for over a month are recruited into the trial from urology clinics in London. They are randomly allocated to either a four-week self-help cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) treatment or to their usual care (control group). The treatment includes information and discussion about hot flushes and night sweats in the context of prostate cancer, monitoring and modifying precipitants, relaxation and paced respiration, stress management, cognitive therapy for unhelpful thoughts and beliefs, managing sleep and night sweats, and advice on maintaining these changes. Prior to randomisation, men attend a clinical interview, undergo 24-48-hour sternal skin conductance monitoring, and complete pre-treatment questionnaires (e.g., problem-rating and frequency of hot flushes and night sweats; quality of life; mood; hot flush beliefs and behaviours). Post-treatment measures (sternal skin conductance and the above questionnaires) are collected four-six weeks later, and again at a six-month follow-up.  Discussion:   MANCAN is the first randomised controlled trial of cognitive behavioural therapy for HF/NS for men that measures both self-reported and physiologically indexed symptoms. The results will inform future clinical practice by evaluating an evidence-based, non-medical treatment, which can be delivered by trained health professionals.

Since these processes depend on the mechanism of cell-protein interaction, we have attempted to show the contribution of Î±5Î²1 and Î±vÎ²3 integrins of the prostate cancer PC-3 cells in in vitro interaction with FN (fibronectin) adsorbed on defined polystyrene surfaces. Cell adhesion, spreading and cytoskeleton organization were studied using antibodies against integrins or a GRGDSP (Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser-Pro) peptide. The results show that blocking the Î±5Î²1 integrin causes: (i) a decrease in the number of the adherent cells in the early phase of adhesion and (ii) a decrease in the dynamics of cell spreading and cell shape changes, and weaker reorganization of cytoskeletal proteins than in the control cells. Conversely, the blocking of the Î±vÎ²3 integrin: (i) causes no observable effect on the number of the adhered cells; however, (ii) causes an increase in the dynamics of cell spreading and cell shape changes, and stronger reorganization of cytoskeletal proteins than in the control cells. Interestingly, the blocking of integrins with a GRGDSP peptide strongly decreases the number of the adhered cells, and a complete inhibition of cell spreading. Our results strongly suggest that the Î±5Î²1 integrin plays the main role in the adhesion and spreading of PC-3 cells interacting with FN, whereas the Î±vÎ²3 integrin seems to regulate other receptors in the spreading process. Moreover, integrin-FN interaction through the RGD sequence evidently curbed the cell adhesion and spreading.""","""['Anna Stachurska', 'Jerzy Elbanowski', 'Hanna M KowalczyÅska']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Cell Biol Int""","""['RGD binding to integrin alphavbeta3 affects cell motility and adhesion in primary human breast cancer cultures.', 'The lipoxygenase inhibitor, baicalein, modulates cell adhesion and migration by up-regulation of integrins and vinculin in rat heart endothelial cells.', 'The integrin alpha5beta1 regulates alphavbeta3-mediated extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation.', 'Biological Relevance of RGD-Integrin Subtype-Specific Ligands in Cancer.', 'Structural basis for ligand recognition by RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp)-dependent integrins.', 'Targeting integrin Î±5Î²1 in urological tumors: opportunities and challenges.', 'Characterization of the Tumor Microenvironment and the Biological Processes with a Role in Prostatic Tumorigenesis.', 'Personalized 3-Gene Panel for Prostate Cancer Target Therapy.', 'Chitosan Containing Nano Zn-Organic Framework: Synthesis, Characterization and Biological Activity.', 'S100A9 promotes prostate cancer cell invasion by activating TLR4/NF-ÎºB/integrin Î²1/FAK signaling.']"""

Recently, the inhibitor of differentiation 1 (Id1) has been linked with angiogenesis, tumorigenesis, metastasis and bone formation. However, the function of Id1 during the process of bone destruction caused by cancer in vivo has not yet been elucidated. We, therefore, examined whether and how Id1 affects the ability of cancer to form osteolytic lesion in vivo. The study used a lentiviral vector overexpressing short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting Id1 gene. PC3 cells, a prostate cancer cell line, were transduced with Id1 shRNA or negative control (NC) shRNA before implantation in BALB/c mice. Cells were implanted in a tibial injection model. Tumor formation in bone was monitored by X-ray. The relationship between parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP), an osteolytic factor, and Id1 was analyzed by using immunohistochemistry in tissue sections from osteolytic lesion of the BALB/c mice. Our results showed that Id1 shRNA delivery to PC3 cells by lentivirus caused efficient and stable Id1 gene silencing. In the intratibial model, PC3 cells produced primarily osteolytic lesions in the bone. Eleven of 14 mice in Id1 shRNA group but only 4 of 14 mice in the NC shRNA group developed osteolytic lesions with cortical destruction at 4th week. Mice treated with Id1 shRNA had larger tumor volume in the bone and larger cortical destruction. The expression of PTHrP protein in PC3 cells was not affected by Id1 knockdown in vivo. These results indicate that Id1 may down-regulate the ability of PC3 cells to form osteolytic lesions in vivo and the signal pathway needs to be further investigated.""","""['Zhengguo Zhang', 'Kuanxin Li', 'Xiaomei Zhang', 'Zhong Fang', 'Wei Xiong', 'Qi Chen', 'Wenjian Chen', 'Feng Li']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""J Huazhong Univ Sci Technolog Med Sci""","""['Downregulation of Id1 by small interfering RNA in prostate cancer PC3 cells in vivo and in vitro.', 'Inhibitor of differentiation 1 (Id1) and Id3 proteins play different roles in TGFÎ² effects on cell proliferation and migration in prostate cancer cells.', 'Runx2 association with progression of prostate cancer in patients: mechanisms mediating bone osteolysis and osteoblastic metastatic lesions.', 'Role of Wnts in prostate cancer bone metastases.', 'Basic mechanisms responsible for osteolytic and osteoblastic bone metastases.', 'Inhibitor of Differentiation 1 (Id1) in Cancer and Cancer Therapy.', 'Mouse models for studying prostate cancer bone metastasis.', 'Assessment of the number and function of macrophages in the placenta of gestational diabetes mellitus patients.']"""

However, therapies targeting EGFR have demonstrated limited effectiveness in PCa. A potential mechanism to overcome EGFR blockade in cancer cells is the autocrine activation of alternative receptors of the human EGFR (HER) family through the overexpression of the HER receptors and ligands. In the present study, we were interested in analyzing if this intrinsic resistance mechanism might contribute to the inefficacy of EGFR inhibitors in PCa. To this end, we selected two androgen-independent human prostate carcinoma cell lines (DU145 and PC3) and established DU145 erlotinib-resistant cells (DUErR). Cells were treated with three EGFR inhibitors (cetuximab, gefinitib and erlotinib) and the sensitivity to each treatment was assessed. The gene expression of the four EGFR/HER receptors and seven ligands of the HER family was analyzed by real-time PCR prior to and after each treatment. The receptors expression and activation were further characterized by flow cytometry and western blot analysis. EGFR inhibition rapidly induced enhanced gene expression of the EGF, betacellulin and neuregulin-1 ligands along with HER2, HER3 and HER4 receptors in the DU145 cells. In contrast, slight changes were observed in the PC3 cells, which are defective in the phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) tumor suppressor gene. In the erlotinib-resistant DUErR cells, the expression of HER2 and HER3 was increased at mRNA and protein levels together with neuregulin-1, leading to enhanced HER3 phosphorylation and the activation of the downstream PI3K/Akt survival pathway. HER3 blockage by a monoclonal antibody restored the cytostatic activity of erlotinib in DUErR cells.

We aimed to explore whether the parameters of postoperative ultrasensitive prostate-specific antigen (PSA) decline provide additional information for predicting PCa progression.  Methods:   A total of 319 consecutive men, with at least 2 years of follow-up after RP for clinically localized PCa were subjected to this study. Intensive postoperative measurements of ultrasensitive PSA resulted in total of 4028 PSA values available for statistical evaluation. Biochemical recurrence (BCR) was defined as PSA â¥0.2 ng/ml.

In patients with BCR, significantly higher values of PSA nadir (p < 0.001) and a decreased time interval from surgery to reach PSA nadir (p < 0.001) were observed. A multivariable Cox regression model confirmed that PSA nadir >0.01 ng/ml (HR 6.01, 95% CI: 3.89-9.52) and time to PSA nadir <3 months (HR 2.86, 95% CI: 1.74-5.01) were independent predictors of BCR.

While the mechanisms underlying this change remain uncertain, characterization of common signaling components that regulate both stages of prostate cancer proliferation is important for developing effective treatment strategies. Here, we demonstrate that paxillin, a known cytoplasmic adaptor protein, regulates both androgen- and EGF-induced nuclear signaling. We show that androgen and EGF promoted MAPK-dependent phosphorylation of paxillin, resulting in nuclear translocation of paxillin. We found nuclear paxillin could then associate with androgen-stimulated androgen receptor (AR). This complex bound AR-sensitive promoters, retaining AR within the nucleus and regulating AR-mediated transcription. Nuclear paxillin also complexed with ERK and ELK1, mediating c-FOS and cyclin D1 expression; this was followed by proliferation. Thus, paxillin is a liaison between extranuclear MAPK signaling and nuclear transcription in response to androgens and growth factors, making it a potential regulator of both castration-sensitive and castration-resistant prostate cancer. Accordingly, paxillin was required for normal growth of human prostate cancer cell xenografts, and its expression was elevated in human prostate cancer tissue microarrays. Paxillin is therefore a potential biomarker for prostate cancer proliferation and a possible therapeutic target for prostate cancer treatment.""","""['Aritro Sen', 'Ismary De Castro', 'Donald B Defranco', 'Fang-Ming Deng', 'Jonathan Melamed', 'Payel Kapur', 'Ganesh V Raj', 'Randall Rossi', 'Stephen R Hammes']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""J Clin Invest""","""['Paxillin regulates androgen- and epidermal growth factor-induced MAPK signaling and cell proliferation in prostate cancer cells.', 'Changes in androgen receptor nongenotropic signaling correlate with transition of LNCaP cells to androgen independence.', 'Angiogenin mediates androgen-stimulated prostate cancer growth and enables castration resistance.', 'Minireview: Recent advances in extranuclear steroid receptor actions.', 'Understanding extranuclear (nongenomic) androgen signaling: what a frog oocyte can tell us about human biology.', 'The Role of Paxillin Aberrant Expression in Cancer and Its Potential as a Target for Cancer Therapy.', 'Paxillin is a potential prognostic biomarker associated with immune cell infiltration in ovarian cancer.', 'Portrait of Molecular Signaling and Putative Therapeutic Targets in Prostate Cancer with ETV4 Fusion.', 'Identification of Paxillin as a Prognostic Factor for Glioblastoma via Integrated Bioinformatics Analysis.', 'Jumonji Domain-containing Protein-3 (JMJD3/Kdm6b) Is Critical for Normal Ovarian Function and Female Fertility.']"""

In this perspective, we upgraded the GATE/GEANT4 Monte Carlo platform in order to recalculate the treatment planning system (TPS) dose distributions for active scanning systems. A method that allows evaluating the TPS dose distributions with the GATE Monte Carlo platform has been developed and applied to the XiO TPS (Elekta), for the IBA proton pencil beam scanning (PBS) system. First, we evaluated the specificities of each dose engine. A dose-conversion scheme that allows one to convert dose to medium into dose to water was implemented within GATE. Specific test cases in homogeneous and heterogeneous configurations allowed for the estimation of the differences between the beam models implemented in XiO and GATE. Finally, dose distributions of a prostate treatment plan were compared. In homogeneous media, a satisfactory agreement was generally obtained between XiO and GATE. The maximum stopping power difference of 3% occurred in a human tissue of 0.9 g cm(-3) density and led to a significant range shift. Comparisons in heterogeneous configurations pointed out the limits of the TPS dose calculation accuracy and the superiority of Monte Carlo simulations. The necessity of computing dose to water in our Monte Carlo code for comparisons with TPSs is also presented. Finally, the new capabilities of the platform are applied to a prostate treatment plan and dose differences between both dose engines are analyzed in detail. This work presents a generic method to compare TPS dose distributions with the GATE Monte Carlo platform. It is noteworthy that GATE is also a convenient tool for imaging applications, therefore opening new research possibilities for the PBS modality.""","""['L Grevillot', 'D Bertrand', 'F Dessy', 'N Freud', 'D Sarrut']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['A Monte Carlo pencil beam scanning model for proton treatment plan simulation using GATE/GEANT4.', 'Clinical implementation of full Monte Carlo dose calculation in proton beam therapy.', 'Monte Carlo simulations for configuring and testing an analytical proton dose-calculation algorithm.', 'A review of the use and potential of the GATE Monte Carlo simulation code for radiation therapy and dosimetry applications.', 'A Monte Carlo tutorial and the application for radiotherapy treatment planning.', 'Proton Minibeam Radiation Therapy and Arc Therapy: Proof of Concept of a Winning Alliance.', 'Technical Note: validation of a material assignment method for a retrospective study of carbon-ion radiotherapy using Monte Carlo simulation.', 'Computer-assisted beam modeling for particle therapy.', 'The role of Monte Carlo simulation in understanding the performance of proton computed tomography.', 'Benchmarking a GATE/Geant4 Monte Carlo model for proton beams in magnetic fields.']"""

Previous studies have indicated that the expression of CSR1 induces cell death. In this study, we found that CSR1 interacts with X-linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein (XIAP), using yeast two-hybrid screening analyses. XIAP overexpression has been found in many human cancers, and forced expression of XIAP blocks apoptosis. Both in vitro and in vivo analyses indicated that the C-terminus of CSR1 binds XIAP with high affinity. Through a series of in vitro recombinant protein-binding analyses, the XIAP-binding motif in CSR1 was determined to include amino acids 513 to 572. Targeted knock-down of XIAP enhanced CSR1-induced cell death, while overexpression of XIAP antagonized CSR1 activity. The binding of CSR1 with XIAP enhanced caspase-9 and caspase-3 protease activities, and CSR1-induced cell death was dramatically reduced on expression of a mutant CSR1 that does not bind XIAP. However, a XIAP mutant that does not interact with caspase-9 had no impact on CSR1-induced cell death. These results suggest that cell death is induced when CSR1 binds XIAP, preventing the interaction of XIAP with caspases. Thus, this study may have elucidated a novel mechanism by which tumor suppressors induce cell death.""","""['Zhong-Liang Zheng', 'Lang-Zhu Tan', 'Yan P Yu', 'George Michalopoulos', 'Jian-Hua Luo']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Am J Pathol""","""['CSR1 induces cell death through inactivation of CPSF3.', 'Cellular stress response 1 down-regulates the expression of epidermal growth factor receptor and platelet-derived growth factor receptor through inactivation of splicing factor 3A3.', 'CSR1 suppresses tumor growth and metastasis of human hepatocellular carcinoma via inhibition of HPIP.', 'Sumoylation Negatively Regulates CSR1-Dependent Prostate Cancer Cell Death.', 'Cellular, biochemical, and genetic analysis of mechanism of small molecule IAP inhibitors.', 'Yeast as a tool to decipher the molecular mechanisms underlying the functions of Bcl-2 family.', 'DICER-AS1 functions as competing endogenous RNA that targets CSR1 by sponging microRNA-650 and suppresses gastric cancer progression.', 'Effect of matrine combined with cisplatin on the expression of XIAP in human rhabdomyosarcoma RD cells.', 'A potential role of X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein in mitochondrial membrane permeabilization and its implication in cancer therapy.', 'Oncogenic Activity of miR-650 in Prostate Cancer Is Mediated by Suppression of CSR1 Expression.']"""

The addition of neo-adjuvant androgen deprivation (NAD) has an indeterminate additive effect. We examined the long-term effect on erectile function (EF) of two durations (4 months: arm 1 and 8 months: arm 2) of NAD prior to radiation (RT) for patients with localised prostate cancer from the Irish Clinical Oncology Research Group (ICORG 97-01) 4- versus 8-month trial. In this study we aimed to (1) analyse the overall effect on EF of NAD in an EBRT population, (2) compare the probability of retained EF over time in an EBRT population treated with either 4 or 8 months of NAD and (3) identify any variables such as risk group and age which may have an additive detrimental effect. This analysis provides unique long term follow up data.  Materials and methods:   From 1997 to 2001, 276 patients with adenocarcinoma of the prostate were randomised to 4 or 8 months of NAD before RT. EF data were recorded at baseline and at each follow-up visit by physician directed questions, using a 4-point grading system.  Results:   Two hundred and thirty patients were included in the analysis of EF and were followed for a median of 80 months. One hundred and forty-one patients had EF at baseline. Neo-adjuvant androgen deprivation in addition to radiation therapy caused a significant reduction in EF. The most significant reduction in EF happens within the first year. The median time to grade 3-4 EF toxicity was 14.6 months, 17.6 months in arm 1 and 13.7 in arm 2. Freedom from late EF toxicity did not differ significantly between arms, overall or at 5 years (n=141). The cumulative probability of EF preservation at 5 years was 28% (22-34) in arm 1 and 24% (19-30) in arm 2. Age was a significant predictor of post-treatment EF.  Conclusions:   The first year post ADT and EBRT poses the greatest risk to sexual function and a continued decline may be expected.

Acute urinary symptoms are common during external beam radiotherapy (EBRT), while chronic symptoms have been linked to urethral dose. Since most low-risk PCa occurs in the peripheral zone (PZ), we hypothesized that EBRT using urethral sparing intensity modulated radiation therapy (US-IMRT) could improve urinary health-related quality of life (HRQOL) while maintaining high rates of PCa control.  Methods:   Patients with National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) defined low-risk PCa with no visible lesion within 5 mm of the prostatic urethra on MRI were randomized to US-IMRT or standard (S-) IMRT. Prescription dose was 75.6 Gy in 41 fractions to the PZ + 3-5 mm for US-IMRT and to the prostate + 3 mm for S-IMRT. For US-IMRT, mean proximal and distal urethral doses were limited to 65 Gy and 74 Gy, respectively. HRQOL was assessed using the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index (EPIC) Quality of Life questionnaire. The primary endpoint was change in urinary HRQOL at 3 months.  Results:   From June 2004 to November 2006, 16 patients were randomized, after which a futility analysis concluded that continued accrual was unlikely to demonstrate a difference in the primary endpoint. Mean change in EPIC urinary HRQOL at 3 months was -0.5 Â± 11.2 in the US-IMRT arm and +3.9 Â± 15.3 in the S-IMRT arm (p = 0.52). Median PSA nadir was higher in the US-IMRT arm (1.46 vs. 0.78, p = 0.05). At 4.7 years median follow-up, three US-IMRT and no S-IMRT patients experienced PSA failure (p = 0.06; HR 8.8, 95% CI 0.9-86). Two out of 3 patients with PSA failure had biopsy-proven local failure, both located contralateral to the original site of disease.  Conclusions:   Compared with S-IMRT, US-IMRT failed to improve urinary HRQOL and resulted in higher PSA nadir and inferior biochemical control. The high rate of PSA failure and contralateral local failures in US-IMRT patients, despite careful selection of MRI-screened low-risk patients, serve as a cautionary tale for focal PCa treatments.""","""['Jeffrey Vainshtein', 'Eyad Abu-Isa', 'Karin B Olson', 'Michael E Ray', 'Howard M Sandler', 'Dan Normolle', 'Dale W Litzenberg', 'Kathryn Masi', 'Charlie Pan', 'Daniel A Hamstra']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Radiat Oncol""","""['Urethra-Sparing Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy for Prostate Cancer: Quality Assurance of a Randomized Phase 2 Trial.', 'Phase 2 trial of guideline-based postoperative image guided intensity modulated radiation therapy for prostate cancer: Toxicity, biochemical, and patient-reported health-related quality-of-life outcomes.', 'Five-year results of IMRT for prostate cancer - tumor control.', 'Dosimetric comparison of high-dose-rate brachytherapy and intensity-modulated radiation therapy as a boost to the prostate.', 'Intensity-modulated radiotherapy for the treatment of prostate cancer: a systematic review and economic evaluation.', 'Stereotactic body radiation therapy for prostate cancer: a study comparing 3-year genitourinary toxicity between CyberKnife and volumetric-modulated arc therapy by propensity score analysis.', 'Prostatic urinary tract visualization with super-resolution deep learning models.', 'SABR for High-Risk Prostate Cancer: A Prospective Multilevel MRI-Based Dose Escalation Trial.', 'A treatment planning study of urethra-sparing intensity-modulated proton therapy for localized prostate cancer.', 'Dosimetric feasibility of stereotactic irradiation of primary prostate cancer at 5x9 Gy with a method of urethral sparing.']"""

Large-scale mRNA profiling experiments have paved the way in identifying androgen-regulated gene networks that control the proliferation, survival, and differentiation of prostate cancer cells. Despite these extensive research efforts, it remains to be determined whether all androgen-mediated mRNA changes faithfully translate into changes in protein abundance that influence prostate tumorigenesis. Here, we report on a mass spectrometry-based quantitative proteomics analysis that identified known androgen signaling pathways and also novel, androgen-sensitive microsome-associated proteins and protein networks that had not been discovered by gene network studies in human LNCaP prostate cancer cells. Androgen-sensitive microsome-associated proteins encoded components of the insulin growth factor-1 (IGF-1), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways. Further bioinformatic analyses showed most of the androgen-sensitive microsome-associated protein networks play roles in cell proliferation and differentiation. Functional validation experiments showed that the androgen-sensitive microsome-associated proteins Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) and I-kappa B kinase complex-associated protein (IKAP) modulated the expression of prostate epithelial and neuronal markers, attenuated proliferation through an androgen receptor-dependent mechanism, and co-regulated androgen receptor-mediated transcription in LNCaP cells. Further biochemical analyses showed that the increased proliferation in JAK2 knockdown cells was mediated by activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), as determined by increased phosphorylation of several downstream targets (p70 S6 kinase, translational repressor 4E-BP1, and 40S ribosomal S6 protein). We conclude that the expression of microsome-associated proteins that were previously implicated in the tumorigenesis of prostate epithelial cells is strongly influenced by androgens. These findings provide a molecular framework for exploring the mechanisms underlying prostate tumorigenesis and how these protein networks might be attenuated or potentiated in disrupting the growth and survival of human prostate cancers.""","""['Harryl D Martinez', 'Jordy J Hsiao', 'Rohini J Jasavala', 'Izumi V Hinkson', 'Jimmy K Eng', 'Michael E Wright']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Genes Cancer""","""['Signal transduction pathways in androgen-dependent and -independent prostate cancer cell proliferation.', 'Androgens induce prostate cancer cell proliferation through mammalian target of rapamycin activation and post-transcriptional increases in cyclin D proteins.', 'IGF-1-stimulated protein synthesis in oligodendrocyte progenitors requires PI3K/mTOR/Akt and MEK/ERK pathways.', 'Androgen receptor-mediated non-genomic regulation of prostate cancer cell proliferation.', 'The PI3K-AKT-mTOR Pathway and Prostate Cancer: At the Crossroads of AR, MAPK, and WNT Signaling.', 'Ribosomal Protein S6: A Potential Therapeutic Target against Cancer?', 'Potentially functional genetic variants in the TNF/TNFR signaling pathway genes predict survival of patients with non-small cell lung cancer in the PLCO cancer screening trial.', 'Structure of the Golgi apparatus is not influenced by a GAG deletion mutation in the dystonia-associated gene Tor1a.', 'Discovery Proteomics Identifies a Molecular Link between the Coatomer Protein Complex I and Androgen Receptor-dependent Transcription.', 'Research Resource: Androgen Receptor Activity Is Regulated Through the Mobilization of Cell Surface Receptor Networks.']"""

Methods:   139 patients suspected of prostate cancer were evaluated with CETRUS followed by systematic and targeted transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsies. The degree of enhancement of the lesions was objectively measured using peak intensity with time-intensity curve analysis software. Ultrasound findings were correlated with clinical characteristics as well as biopsy and radical prostatectomy findings.  Results:   Prostate cancers were detected in 230 biopsy sites from 91 patients. The mean peak intensity value of prostate cancer was significantly higher than that of the benign lesions (9.82 Â± 3.73 vs 7.51 Â± 2.97; p<0.001), and the peak intensity value of the cancer foci varied across the prostate. The mixed model analysis revealed that the location and Gleason score of tumour foci were the influencing factors of the peak intensity value, and the former had a stronger influence upon peak intensity than the latter (p=0.000 and 0.040, respectively). However, age, prostate volume or serum prostate-specific antigen of the patient had no significant influence on the peak intensity value (p>0.05). Furthermore, the peak intensity value of tumours larger than 5 mm diameter was significantly higher than tumours of 5 mm or smaller diameter (9.28 Â± 2.46 vs 6.69 Â± 2.65; p<0.001).

We examined the association of diabetes with cause-specific mortality, including deaths from specific cancers.  Research design and methods:   A prospective cohort of 1,053,831 U.S. adults, without cancer at baseline, enrolled in the Cancer Prevention Study-II in 1982 and was followed for mortality until December 2008. At baseline, participants completed a self-administered questionnaire that included information on diabetes, smoking, physical activity, height, and weight. Multivariable-adjusted relative risks (RRs) (95% CI) were estimated using Cox proportional hazards regression.  Results:   During 26 years of follow-up, 243,051 men and 222,109 women died. In multivariable models that controlled for age, BMI, and other variables, diabetes was associated with higher risk of all-cause mortality (women RR 1.90 [95% CI 1.87-1.93]; men 1.73 [1.70-1.75]). Among women, diabetes was associated with higher risk of death from cancers of the liver (1.40 [1.05-1.86]), pancreas (1.31 [1.14-1.51]), endometrium (1.33 [1.08-1.65]), colon (1.18 [1.04-1.33]), and breast (1.16 [1.03-1.29]).

Dynamic light scattering and freeze-fracture transmission electron microscopy studies showed that ETO and RUB formed ETO-RUB nanoparticles (â¼6 nm in diameter). The powder of ETO-RUB nanoparticles was completely reconstitutable in water and remained stable in this solution at 25 and 37Â°C for at least 24h. Under other physiologic conditions, ETO solution was clear and free of precipitation at 25Â°C, but underwent various structural transformations. In PBS and simulated intestinal fluid, RUB-solubilized ETO underwent epimerization and equilibrated to cis-ETO. In simulated gastric fluid, RUB-solubilized ETO degraded to 4'-demethylepipodophyllotoxin-beta-d-glucoside and 4'-demethylepipodophyllotoxin. Higher temperatures favored epimerization or degradation. Furthermore, a side-by-side comparison with DMSO-solubilized ETO confirmed that the RUB-solubilized ETO showed no significant differences in cytotoxicity in colon, breast and prostate cancer cell lines.

We examined the ability of these guidelines to correctly predict lymph node invasion in patients treated with extended pelvic lymph node dissection.  Materials and methods:   We examined 3,064 consecutive patients treated with radical prostatectomy and extended pelvic lymph node dissection between 2000 and 2010. We formally validated the NCCN guideline nomogram using discrimination, calibration and decision curve analysis as benchmarks. Moreover the performance characteristics of the 2% nomogram cutoff as well as other cutoff values (range 1% to 10%) were tested.  Results:   Overall 10.0% of patients had lymph node invasion. The discrimination accuracy of the NCCN guideline nomogram was 79.8%, with a maximum underestimation of the lymph node invasion risk of 41.2%. On decision curve analysis the NCCN nomogram fared better than not performing pelvic lymph node dissection in all patients. However, in the prediction range between 0% and 9% the nomogram did not fare better than performing pelvic lymph node dissection in all patients. The use of the 2% cutoff would allow the avoidance of 49.3% of pelvic lymph node dissections, at the cost of missing 20.3% of patients with lymph node invasion.

Objective:   To prospectively evaluate the diagnostic yield of a 21-core biopsy protocol as an initial strategy for prostate cancer (PCa) detection.  Design, setting, and participants:   During 10 yr, 2753 consecutive patients underwent a 21-core biopsy scheme for their first set of biopsy specimens.  Intervention:   All patients underwent a standardized 21-core protocol with cores mapped for location.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The PCa detection rate of each biopsy scheme (6, 12, or 21 cores) was compared using a McNemar test. Predictive factors of the diagnostic yield achieved by a 21-core scheme were studied using logistic regression analyses.  Results and limitations:   PCa detection rates using 6 sextant biopsies, 12 cores, and 21 cores were 32.5%, 40.4%, and 43.3%, respectively. The 12-core procedure improved the cancer detection rate by 19.4% (p=0.004), and the 21-biopsy scheme improved the rate by 6.7% overall (p<0.001). The six far lateral cores were the most efficient in terms of detection rate. The diagnostic yield of the 21-core protocol was >10% in prostates with volume >70 ml, in men with a prostate-specific antigen level<4 ng/ml, with a prostate-specific antigen density (PSAD) <0.20 ng/ml per gram. A PSAD <0.20 ng/ml per gram was the strongest independent predictive factor of the diagnostic yield offered by the 21-core scheme (p<0.001). The 21-core protocol significantly increased the rate of PCa eligible for active surveillance (62.5% vs 48.4%; p=0.036) than those detected by a 12-core scheme without statistically increasing the rate of insignificant PCa (p=0.503).  Conclusions:   A 21-core biopsy scheme improves significantly the PCa detection rate compared with a 12-core protocol.

Methods:   We identified men at 2 centers who presented with PVF after prostate cancer treatment from January 2000 to December 2010. Prostate cancer was treated with radiotherapy (RT) or radical prostatectomy, or both. Patients with bladder neck contracture (BNC) received endoscopic treatment. The demographic and clinical data were collected.  Results:   Of the 12 patients who presented with PVF, the treatment of prostate cancer was external beam RT in 8 (5 of whom underwent subsequent salvage radical prostatectomy) and radical prostatectomy (followed by salvage RT) in 4. All patients developed BNC requiring endoscopic treatment. The median interval between primary endoscopic treatment of BNC and the development of PVF was 35.9 months (range 0.6 to 97). The most common presenting symptom was suprapubic or groin pain. Of the 12 patients, 10 ultimately required cystectomy with urinary diversion.  Conclusion:   The treatment of prostate cancer with RT followed by the development of BNC requiring endoscopic intervention appears to be associated with PVF development Despite conservative measures, patients who developed PVF often required cystectomy with urinary diversion. To avoid PVF, care should be taken during endoscopic intervention for BNC in patients who have received RT for prostate cancer.

This study was performed to identify preoperative values predictive of pathological and oncological outcomes based on standardized extended prostate biopsies with core histological results diagrammed/mapped in patients receiving radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer clinically diagnosed as localized or locally advanced disease.  Methods:   In 124 patients with clinically localized or locally advanced prostate cancer (cT1c-cT3a) without prior treatment, pathological outcomes on the surgical specimen including seminal vesicle involvement (SVI), positive surgical margin (PSM), and perineural invasion (PNI) were studied in comparison with clinical parameters based on the results of 14-core prostate biopsies comprising sextant, laterally-directed sextant, and bilateral transition zone (TZ) sampling.  Results:   Concerning the association of pathological outcomes with oncological outcomes, patients with PSM and PNI on surgical specimens had poorer biochemical-progression-free survival than those without PSM (logrank p = 0.002) and PNI (p = 0.003); it was also poorer concerning SVI, although the difference was not significant (p = 0.120). Concerning the impact of clinical parameters on these pathological outcomes, positive TZ and multiple positive biopsy cores in the prostatic middle were independent values predictive of SVI with multivariate analyses (p = 0.020 and p = 0.025, respectively); both positive TZ and multiple positive prostatic middle biopsies were associated with larger tumor volume (p < 0.001 in both). The percentage of positive biopsy cores (%positive cores) and biopsy Gleason score were independent values predictive of PSM (p = 0.001) and PNI (p = 0.001), respectively. Multiple positive cores in the prostatic base were associated with proximal/bladder-side PSM (p < 0.001), and also linked to poorer biochemical-progression-free survival (p = 0.004). Clinical T stage had no association with these pathological outcomes.  Conclusions:   %positive cores and Gleason score in extended biopsies were independent values predictive of PSM and PNI in prostate cancer clinically diagnosed as localized or locally advanced disease, respectively, which were associated with poorer oncological outcomes.

An institutional experience is reported with perioperative morbidity and oncological outcomes.  Methods:   Patients were identified retrospectively from a prospectively collected institutional database (1992-2010). Outcomes, and clinical and pathological factors were determined from medical records. Estimated overall survival, overall recurrence and local recurrence were compared using the log rank method and Cox regression analysis.  Results:   Among 1831 patients with rectal cancer, 124 (6Â·8 per cent) underwent en bloc resection of part or all of an adjacent organ (vagina/uterus/ovary 90, prostate/seminal vesicle 23, bladder/ureter 15, small bowel/appendix 7). Five-year overall survival and local recurrence rates were 53Â·3 and 18Â·8 per cent respectively. There was one postoperative death, from multiple organ failure in a patient with liver cirrhosis. Fifty-two patients underwent sphincter-preserving surgery and three (6 per cent) developed an anastomotic leak. On univariable analysis, the only factor associated with local recurrence was completeness of resection (local recurrence rate 15 per cent versus 69 per cent for R0 versus R1 resection; P < 0Â·001). On multivariable analysis, factors associated with overall survival were sphincter-preserving surgery, absence of metastatic disease and R0 resection.

The goal of this paper is to evaluate the diagnostic potential of the S3 technique for the detection and characterization of normal and cancerous prostate tissues. Pairs of cancerous and normal prostate tissue samples were taken from each of eight patients. Stokes shift spectra were measured by simultaneously scanning both the excitation and emission wavelengths while keeping a fixed wavelength interval ÎÎ»=20 nm between them. The salient features of this technique are the highly resolved emission peaks and significant spectral differences between the normal and cancerous prostate tissues, as observed in the wavelength region of 250 to 600 nm. The Stokes shift spectra of cancerous and normal prostate tissues revealed distinct peaks around 300, 345, 440, and 510 nm, which are attributed to tryptophan, collagen, NADH, and flavin, respectively. To quantify the spectral differences between the normal and cancerous prostate tissues, two spectral ratios were computed. The findings revealed that both ratio parameters R1=I297/I345 and R2=I307/I345 were excellent diagnostic ratio parameters giving 100% specificity and 100% sensitivity for distinguishing cancerous tissue from the normal tissue.

Patients and methods:   In this open-label phase II study, the mTOR inhibitor Ridaforolimus was administered at a dose of 50 mg intravenous once weekly to 38 patients with taxane-treated CRPC. The primary end point was best overall response according to modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors guidelines. Serum prostate-specific antigen levels were prospectively monitored as a biomarker for cancer activity.  Results:   No objective responses were observed, but 18 patients (47.4%) had stable disease as their best response. Based on progression-free survival analysis, median time to progression with Ridaforolimus was 28 days (95% confidence interval, 27-29). Eight patients (21.1%) had stable disease as their best overall prostate-specific antigen response. The median number of days from first to last dose was 109.5 days (range, 1-442 days). Ridaforolimus was generally well tolerated, with a safety profile similar to that observed in patients with advanced malignancies. The most common side effects were typically mild or moderate in severity.  Conclusions:   Ridaforolimus was generally well tolerated.

Both corepressors and coactivators regulate AR-mediated transcriptional activity, and aberrant expression or activity due to mutation(s) contributes to changes in AR function in the progression to androgen resistance acquired during hormonal ablation therapies. Primary culture of epithelial cells from androgen-dependent CWR22 and androgen-resistant CWR22R xenograft tumors were used to evaluate the effect of androgens on AR function, and the association with coactivators (SRC-1 and TIF-2) and corepressors (SMRT and NCoR). Both androgen-dependent CWR22 and androgen-resistant CWR22R cells expressed functional AR as the receptor bind ligand with high affinity and increased trafficking to the nuclei in the presence of androgens. However, in the presence of androgens, AR-mediated transcriptional activity in androgen-sensitive CWR22 cells was limited to a 2-fold increase, as compared to a 6-fold increase in androgen-resistance CWR22R cells. In androgen-sensitive CWR22 cells, immunoblot, confocal microscopy, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays indicated that the androgen bound AR transcriptional initiation complex in the PSA promoter contained corepressor SMRT, resulting in limited receptor transcriptional activity. In contrast, increased AR-mediated transcriptional activity in the CWR22R cells was consistent with decreased expression and recruitment of the corepressors SMRT/NCoR, as well as increased recruitment of the coactivator TIF-2 to the receptor complex. Similar changes in the response to androgens were observed in the LNCaP/C4-2 model of androgen resistance prostate cancer. Thus, altered recruitment and loss of corepressors SMRT/NCoR may provide a mechanism that changes the response of AR function to ligands and contributes to the progression of the advanced stages of human prostate cancer.""","""['Alejandro S Godoy', 'Paula C Sotomayor', 'Marcelo Villagran', 'Rami Yacoub', 'Viviana P Montecinos', 'Eileen M McNerney', 'Michael Moser', 'Barbara A Foster', 'Sergio A Onate']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Biochem Biophys Res Commun""","""['Activity of androgen receptor antagonist bicalutamide in prostate cancer cells is independent of NCoR and SMRT corepressors.', 'Formation of AR-SMRT binding in prostate cancer cells treated with natural histone deacetylase inhibitor.', 'Inhibition of MAPK-signaling pathway promotes the interaction of the corepressor SMRT with the human androgen receptor and mediates repression of prostate cancer cell growth in the presence of antiandrogens.', 'Androgen axis in prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptor signaling in prostate cancer.', 'Nuclear receptor co-repressor NCOR2 and its relation to GPER with prognostic impact in ovarian cancer.', 'Transcriptional Repression of Aerobic Glycolysis by OVOL2 in Breast Cancer.', 'Nuclear receptor corepressor (NCoR) is a positive prognosticator for cervical cancer.', 'The COSMIC Cancer Gene Census: describing genetic dysfunction across all human cancers.', 'High-Content Screening Campaign to Identify Compounds That Inhibit or Disrupt Androgen Receptor-Transcriptional Intermediary Factor 2 Protein-Protein Interactions for the Treatment of Prostate Cancer.']"""

Methods:   MMP-9, MMP-2 and its specific inhibitors expression levels were analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) in fresh-frozen malignant tissue collected from 40 patients with BC submitted to transurethral resection of bladder. The control group consisted of normal bladder tissue from five patients who had undergone retropubic prostatectomy to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia.  Results:   MMP-9 was overexpressed in 59.0 % of patients, and MMP-2, TIMP-1, TIMP-2, MMP-14, RECK and IL-8 was underexpressed in most of the patients.

The effects of manipulating psoriasin expression on cellular functions of CaP cells were assessed using in vitro assays.  Results:   Psoriasin was expressed in prostate epithelia and cancer cells. Elevated expression of psoriasin was evident in CaP from its IHC staining in CaP frozen specimens. Psoriasin promoted cell survival under serum starvation. Its expression was inversely correlated with cell-matrix adhesion. Psoriasin increased invasiveness of PC-3 cells via a regulation of matrix metalproteinases (MMPs).

Materials and methods:   IGRT treatment delivery times were recorded automatically on either unit. Costing was calculated from real costs derived from the implementation of a new radiotherapy centre. To derive cost per minute for EPI and KVI units the total annual setting up and running costs were divided by the total annual working time. The cost per IGRT fraction was calculated by multiplying the cost per minute by the duration of treatment. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to test the robustness of our analysis. Treatment times without couch shift were compared.  Results:   Time data were analysed for 8648 fractions, 6057 from KVI treatment and 2591 from EPI treatment from a total of 294 patients. The median time for KVI treatment was 6.0 min (interquartile range 5.1-7.4 min) and for EPI treatment it was 10.0 min (interquartile range 8.3-11.8 min) (P value < 0.0001). The cost per fraction for KVI was A$258.79 and for EPI was A$345.50. The cost saving per fraction for KVI varied between A$66.09 and A$101.64 by sensitivity analysis. In patients where no couch shift was made, the median treatment delivery time for EPI was 8.8 min and for KVI was 5.1 min.  Conclusions:   Treatment time is less on KVI units compared with EPI units.

Materials and methods:   A Markov decision analysis model with probabilistic sensitivity analysis was designed with the various disease states of a 70-year-old patient with organ-confined prostate cancer to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of 2 external beam radiation treatment options.  Results:   The Monte Carlo simulation revealed that the mean cost and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) for SBRT and IMRT were $22,152 and 7.9 years and $35,431 and 7.9 years, respectively. The sensitivity analysis revealed that if the SBRT cohort experienced a decrease in quality of life of 4% or a decrease in efficacy of 6%, then SBRT would no longer dominate IMRT in cost-effectiveness. In fact, with these relaxed assumptions for SBRT, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of IMRT met the societal willingness to pay threshold of $50,000 per QALY.  Conclusions:   Compared with IMRT, SBRT for lowto intermediate-risk prostate cancer has great potential cost savings for our healthcare system payers and may improve access to radiation, increase patient convenience, and boost quality of life for patients. Our model suggests that the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of IMRT compared with SBRT is highly sensitive to quality-oflife outcomes, which should be adequately and comparably measured in current and future prostate SBRT studies.""","""['Joseph C Hodges', 'Yair Lotan', 'Thomas P Boike', 'Rhonda Benton', 'Alyson Barrier', 'Robert D Timmerman']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Am J Manag Care""","""['Cost-effectiveness analysis of stereotactic body radiation therapy versus intensity-modulated radiation therapy: an emerging initial radiation treatment option for organ-confined prostate cancer.', 'Cost-effectiveness analysis of SBRT versus IMRT for low-risk prostate cancer.', 'Cost-effectiveness of modern radiotherapy techniques in locally advanced pancreatic cancer.', 'Systematic review of the cost effectiveness of radiation therapy for prostate cancer from 2003 to 2013.', 'Cost-effectiveness analysis of intensity-modulated radiation therapy with normal and hypofractionated schemes for the treatment of localised prostate cancer.', 'Benefits of Adopting Hypofractionated Radiotherapy as a Standard of Care in Low-and Middle-Income Countries.', 'Acute side effects after definitive stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for patients with clinically localized or locally advanced prostate cancer: a single institution prospective study.', 'A Cost-Effectiveness and Quality of Life Analysis of Different Approaches to the Management and Treatment of Localized Prostate Cancer.', 'Decision Support Systems in Prostate Cancer Treatment: An Overview.', 'Economic evaluation of treatments for patients with localized prostate cancer in Europe: a systematic review.']"""

To meet this need for novel therapies, our laboratory has previously generated conditionally replicating adenovirus (CRAd) vectors expressing the sodium iodide symporter (hNIS). This virus transduced PCa cells and induced functional NIS expression, allowing for noninvasive tumor imaging and combination therapy with radioiodide, referred to as radiovirotherapy. We have now generated two new modified vectors to further improve efficacy. Ad5/3PB-ADP-hNIS and Ad5/3PB-hNIS include a hybrid Ad5/3 fiber knob to improve transduction efficiency, and express NIS from the endogenous major late promoter to restrict NIS expression to target cells. Additionally, Ad5/3PB-ADP-hNIS includes the adenovirus death protein (ADP), which hastens the release of viral particles after assembly. These two vectors specifically induce radioisotope uptake, cytopathic effect, and viral replication in androgen receptor-expressing PCa cell lines with Ad5/3PB-ADP-hNIS showing earlier (131)I uptake and cytolysis at low multiplicity of infection. SPECT-CT imaging of xenograft tumors infected with Ad5/3PB-hNIS showed steady uptake, whereas infection with Ad5/3PB-ADP-hNIS led to increasing uptake, indicating viral spread. Radiovirotherapy of xenograft LNCaP tumors with Ad5/3PB-ADP-hNIS showed the most significant survival extension versus control tumors (p=0.001), but the benefit of radiovirotherapy was not statistically significant compared with virotherapy alone in this model.

On the other hand, AMP showed much less activity in inhibiting the proliferation of normal prostate epithelial cells than that of prostate cancer cell lines. AMP also inhibited the migration and invasion of PC-3 cells in vitro associated with down-regulation of CXCR4 expression. In the animal study using an orthotopic prostate tumor model, AMP (150 and 300 mg/kg body weight) inhibited the growth of PC-3 tumors and lymph node and lung metastases in a dose-dependent manner.

The in vivo anti-growth and anti-metastasis activities of AMP were associated with induction of apoptosis and inhibition of proliferation of prostate cancer cells, reduction of prostate tumor angiogenesis, and reduction of CXCR4 expression.

However, the precise mechanisms by which the predominantly cytoplasmic TPR proteins affect downstream transcriptional outcomes of steroid signaling remain unclear. In this study, we assessed how SGTA affects ligand sensitivity and action of the androgen receptor (AR) using a transactivation profiling approach. Deletion mapping coupled with structural prediction, transcriptional assays, and in vivo regulation of AR-responsive promoters were used to assess the role of SGTA domains in AR responses. At subsaturating ligand concentrations of â¤ 0.1 nM 5Î±-dihydrotestosterone, SGTA overexpression constricted AR activity by an average of 32% (P<0.002) across the majority of androgen-responsive loci tested, as well as on endogenous promoters in vivo. The strength of the SGTA effect was associated with the presence or absence of bioinformatically predicated transcription factor motifs at each site. Homodimerizaion of SGTA, which is thought to be necessary for chaperone complex formation, was found to be dependent on the structural integrity of amino acids 1-80, and a core evolutionary conserved peptide within this region (amino acids 21-40) necessary for an effect of SGTA on the activity of both exogenous and endogenous AR. This study provides new insights into the subdomain structure of SGTA and how SGTA acts as a regulator of AR ligand sensitivity.

In the present study, we investigated the efficacy of a novel phytochemical poly[3-(3, 4-dihydroxyphenyl)glyceric acid] (p-DGA) from Caucasian species of comfrey (Symphytum caucasicum) and its synthetic derivative syn-2, 3-dihydroxy-3-(3, 4-dihydroxyphenyl) propionic acid (m-DGA) against PCA LNCaP and 22Rv1 cells. We found that both p-DGA and m-DGA suppressed the growth and induced death in PCA cells, with comparatively lesser cytotoxicity towards non-neoplastic human prostate epithelial cells. Furthermore, we also found that both p-DGA and m-DGA caused G(1) arrest in PCA cells through modulating the expression of cell cycle regulators, especially an increase in CDKIs (p21 and p27). In addition, p-DGA and m-DGA induced apoptotic death by activating caspases, and also strongly decreased AR and PSA expression. Consistent with in vitro results, our in vivo study showed that p-DGA feeding strongly inhibited 22Rv1 tumors growth by 76% and 88% at 2.5 and 5mg/kg body weight doses, respectively, without any toxicity, together with a strong decrease in PSA level in plasma; and a decrease in PCNA, AR and PSA expression but increase in p21/p27 expression and apoptosis in tumor tissues from p-DGA-fed mice.

Here, we sought to identify a predictor of treatment benefit for renal cancer patients treated with MVA-5T4. Statistical modeling was undertaken using data from a phase III trial in which patients requiring first-line treatment for metastatic renal cell carcinoma were randomized 1:1 to receive MVA-5T4 or placebo alongside sunitinib, IL-2 or IFN-Î±. Numerous pre-treatment factors associated with inflammatory anemia (e.g., CRP, hemoglobin, hematocrit, IL-6, ferritin, platelets) demonstrated a significant relationship with tumor burden and patient survival. From these prognostic factors, the pre-treatment mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) was found to be the best predictor of treatment benefit (P < 0.01) for MVA-5T4 treated patients and also correlated positively with tumor shrinkage (P < 0.001).

Percentages of patients with either 18F-NaF- or 18F-FDG-positive PET/CT in RP and external beam radiation therapy were 10% (n=10) and undefined (n=0) for a PSA of 2 ng/mL or less, 29% (n=7) and 50% (n=2) for PSA greater than 2 ng/mL but 4 ng/mL or less, 60% (n=5) and 40% (n=5) for PSA greater than 4 ng/mL but 10 ng/mL or less, and 25% (n=4) and 25% (n=4) for PSA greater than 10 ng/mL, respectively.  Conclusions:   In biochemical relapse of prostate cancer, 18 F-NaF PET/CT is useful in the detection of occult osseous metastases, whereas the yield of 18F-FDG PET/CT is relatively limited. 18F-NaF PET/CT positivity tends to associate with increasing PSA level in prostatectomized men and may occur in lower PSA ranges than conventionally recognized.""","""['Hossein Jadvar', 'Bhushan Desai', 'Lingyun Ji', 'Peter S Conti', 'Tanya B Dorff', 'Susan G Groshen', 'Mitchell E Gross', 'Jacek K Pinski', 'David I Quinn']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Clin Nucl Med""","""['More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Prospective Comparison of 99mTc-MDP Scintigraphy, Combined 18F-NaF and 18F-FDG PET/CT, and Whole-Body MRI in Patients with Breast and Prostate Cancer.', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen and Prostate-Specific Antigen Kinetics in Predicting 18F-Sodium Fluoride Positron Emission Tomography-Computed Tomography Positivity for First Bone Metastases in Patients with Biochemical Recurrence after Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Positron emission tomography for prostate, bladder, and renal cancer.', 'The role of choline positron emission tomography/computed tomography in the management of patients with prostate-specific antigen progression after radical treatment of prostate cancer.', 'The value of 18F-NaF PET/CT in the diagnosis of bone metastases in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma using visual and quantitative analyses.', 'With New Technology Comes Great Responsibility: Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen Imaging in Recurrent Prostate Cancer.', 'Comparison of Bone Metastases between 18F-NaF PET/CT, 18F-NaF PET, and Planar 99mTc-MDP Bone Scintigraphy in Patients with Newly Diagnosed Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma.', 'Lipid Metabolism and Epigenetics Crosstalk in Prostate Cancer.', ""PARP Inhibitors and Radiometabolic Approaches in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: What's Now, What's New, and What's Coming?""]"""

We evaluated the results of treatment for hemorrhagic proctitis after IMRT for prostate cancer.  Methods:   Between November 2004 and February 2010, 403 patients with prostate cancer were treated with IMRT at 2 institutions. Among these patients, 64 patients who developed late rectal bleeding were evaluated. Forty patients had received IMRT using a linear accelerator and 24 by tomotherapy. Their median age was 72 years. Each patient was assessed clinically and/or endoscopically. Depending on the severity, steroid suppositories or enemas were administered up to twice daily and Argon plasma coagulation (APC) was performed up to 3 times. Response to treatment was evaluated using the Rectal Bleeding Score (RBS), which is the sum of Frequency Score (graded from 1 to 3 by frequency of bleeding) and Amount Score (graded from 1 to 3 by amount of bleeding). Stoppage of bleeding over 3 months was scored as RBS 1.  Results:   The median follow-up period for treatment of rectal bleeding was 35 months (range, 12-69 months). Grade of bleeding was 1 in 31 patients, 2 in 26, and 3 in 7. Nineteen of 45 patients (42%) observed without treatment showed improvement and bleeding stopped in 17 (38%), although mean RBS did not change significantly. Eighteen of 29 patients (62%) treated with steroid suppositories or enemas showed improvement (mean RBS, from 4.1 Â± 1.0 to 3.0 Â± 1.8, p = 0.003) and bleeding stopped in 9 (31%). One patient treated with steroid enema 0.5-2 times a day for 12 months developed septic shock and died of multiple organ failure. All 12 patients treated with APC showed improvement (mean RBS, 4.7 Â± 1.2 to 2.3 Â± 1.4, p < 0.001) and bleeding stopped in 5 (42%).

The aim of the present study was to investigate the genes for vitamin D enzymes in patients with DTC and healthy controls (HC) as well as the vitamin D (25-hydroxyvitamin D(3), and 1,25-hydroxyvitamin) status.  Methods:   German patients (n=253) with DTC (papillary thyroid carcinoma [PTC] and follicular thyroid carcinoma [FTC]) and HC (n=302) were genotyped for polymorphisms within the vitamin D metabolizing enzymes such as 25-hydroxylase (CYP2R1[rs12794714, rs10741657]), 25-hydroxyvitamin D-1Î±-hydroxylase (CYP27B1[rs10877012, rs4646536]), and 25-hydroxyvitamin D 24-hydrolase (CYP24A1[rs927650, rs2248137, rs2296241]). Furthermore, the 25-hydroxyvitamin D(3) [25(OH)D(3)] and 1,25-hydroxyvitamin [1,25(OH)(2)D(3)] plasma levels were measured by a radioimmunoassay.  Results:   There was no difference in the genotypes; however, the CYP24A1 haplotype analysis showed that rs2248137C/rs2296241A (13.1% vs. 19.1%; corrected p [pc]=0.04) was less frequent in the PTC, whereas the haplotypes rs2248137C/rs2296241G (56.0% vs. 41.9%; pc=0.03), rs927650C/rs2296241G (22.5% vs. 8.4%; pc=1.6Ã10(-3)), and rs927650C/rs2248137C/rs2296241G (21.1% vs. 7.3%; pc=1.5Ã10(-3)) were more frequent in the FTC compared with HC. Furthermore, if patients and controls were grouped according to four 25(OH)D(3) categories (severely deficient, deficient, insufficient, and sufficient), then the patients with both DTC subtypes had significantly lower levels of circulating 1,25(OH)(2)D(3), especially in the group with a deficient 25(OH)D(3) status compared with the controls. Although the polymorphisms showed no differences stratified for the four 25(OH)D(3) categories, the activation status by 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) differed significantly depending on the genotypes of the investigated CYP24A1 polymorphisms.  Conclusions:   A higher risk for DTC is conferred by haplotypes within the CYP24A1 gene, low circulating 25(OH)D(3) levels (deficiency), and a reduced conversion to 1,25(OH)(2)D(3). These results confirm and extend previous observations and also support a role of the vitamin D system in the pathogenesis of DTC. How deficient 25(OH)D(3) levels in combination with certain CYP24A1 haplotypes affect vitamin D activation is the subject of future studies.""","""['Marissa Penna-Martinez', 'Elizabeth Ramos-Lopez', 'Julienne Stern', 'Heinrich Kahles', 'Nora Hinsch', 'Martin-Leo Hansmann', 'Ivan Selkinski', 'Frank GrÃ¼nwald', 'Christian VorlÃ¤nder', 'Wolf O Bechstein', 'Stefan Zeuzem', 'Katharina Holzer', 'Klaus Badenhoop']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Thyroid""","""['Vitamin D in Type 2 Diabetes: Genetic Susceptibility and the Response to Supplementation.', 'Vitamin D hydroxylases CYP2R1, CYP27B1 and CYP24A1 in renal cell carcinoma.', 'Vitamin D Metabolic Pathway Genes Polymorphisms and Their Methylation Levels in Association With Rheumatoid Arthritis.', 'Vitamin D status and gene transcription in immune cells.', 'Metabolism of vitamin D3 by cytochromes P450.', 'Vitamin D Status in Patients before Thyroidectomy.', 'Vitamin D-Related Genes and Thyroid Cancer-A Systematic Review.', 'Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level is unreliable as a risk factor and prognostic marker in papillary thyroid cancer.', 'Relationship Between Vitamin D and Thyroid: An Enigma.', 'The Role of Vitamin D as a Prognostic Marker in Papillary Thyroid Cancer.']"""

We show that this communication occurs via sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) generated systemically by sphingosine kinase 1 (SK1), rather than via tumour-derived S1P. Modulation of systemic, but not tumour SK1, prevented S1P elevation, and inhibited TRAMP-induced prostate cancer growth in TRAMP(+/+) SK1(-/-) mice, or lung metastasis of multiple cancer cells in SK1(-/-) animals. Genetic loss of SK1 activated a master metastasis suppressor, Brms1 (breast carcinoma metastasis suppressor 1), via modulation of S1P receptor 2 (S1PR2) in cancer cells. Alterations of S1PR2 using pharmacologic and genetic tools enhanced Brms1. Moreover, Brms1 in S1PR2(-/-) MEFs was modulated by serum S1P alterations. Accordingly, ectopic Brms1 in MB49 bladder cancer cells suppressed lung metastasis, and stable knockdown of Brms1 prevented this process.

Reasons may include poor functional status, comorbidities, and patient preference. To the authors' knowledge, the prevalence and characteristics of this population have not previously been described.  Methods:   The National Cancer Data Base was queried for patients diagnosed with metastatic (stage IV according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer) solid tumors (including those of the breast, cervix, colon, and kidney; small cell and nonsmall cell lung cancer [NSCLC]; and tumors of the prostate, rectum, and uterus) who received neither radiotherapy nor systemic therapy. Log-binomial regression analysis was used to estimate prevalence ratios (PRs) for the percentage of untreated to treated patients with stage IV cancer.  Results:   Between 2000 and 2008, 773,233 patients with stage IV cancer were identified, 159,284 of whom (20.6%; 95% confidence interval, 20.5%-20.7%) received no anticancer therapy. Patients with NSCLC accounted for 55% of the untreated population. Patients with cancers of the kidney and lung had the highest rates of no treatment at 25.5% and 24.0%, respectively, whereas patients with prostate cancer had the lowest rate of no treatment at 11.1%. Across all cancer types, older age (PR range, 1.37-1.49; all P < .001), black race (PR range, 1.05-1.32; all P < .001), lack of medical insurance (PR range, 1.47-2.46; all P < .001), and lower income (except for cancer of the uterus; PR range, 0.91-0.98 for every $10,000-increase in income [all P < .001]) were associated with a lack of treatment.  Conclusions:   Approximately 20% of patients who present with stage IV solid tumors do not receive anticancer therapy.

Among the R-Smads, Smads 1, 5, and 8 mainly mediate signals in the bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) pathways, while Smads 2/3 mediate TGF-Î² signaling. The regulation of Smads in the TGF-Î² signal pathway has been well defined, but the relationship of Smads 1, 5, and 8 to the BMP pathways has been relatively understudied. To understand the specific regulation of BMP mediating Smads, we performed yeast two-hybrid screening using the Mad homology 2(MH2) domain of Smad8 as bait. In this screening, novel Smad-binding protein, CREBZF-a basic region-leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor-was identified. The interaction of CREBZF and Smads 1, 5, and 8 was confirmed by immunoprecipitation in a human prostate cancer cell line. Overexpression of CREBZF inhibited the promoter activity of BMP response element and abolished the cell growth inhibition induced by BMP-6. Thus, CREBZF inhibits the function of BMP-6 by interacting with Smads.

Moreover, the algorithm selects regions of interest (masks) in the x-rays based on 3D segmentations from the pre-planning stage. For validation, orthogonal x-ray pairs from different viewing directions of 80 pelvic cone-beam CT (CBCT) raw data sets were used. The 2D/3D results were compared to corresponding standard 3D/3D CBCT-to-CT alignments. Outcome over 8400 2D/3D experiments showed that parametric errors in root mean square were <0.18Â° (rotations) and <0.73 mm (translations), respectively, using rank correlation as intensity metric. This corresponds to a mean target registration error, related to the voxels of the lesser pelvis, of <2 mm in 94.1% of the cases.

This effect of hypoxia and TGF-Î²1 might be responsible for tumor progression and metastasis of advanced prostate cancer. In the present study, TGF-Î²1 was shown to induce VEGFA(165) secretion from both normal cell lines (HPV7 and RWPE1) and prostate cancer cell lines (DU145 and PC3). Conversely, hypoxia-stimulated VEGFA(165) secretion was observed only in prostate cancer cell lines. Hypoxia induced TGF-Î²1 expression in PC3 prostate cancer cells, and the TGF-Î² type I receptor (ALK5) kinase inhibitor partially blocked hypoxia-mediated VEGFA(165) secretion. This effect of hypoxia provides a novel mechanism to increase VEGFA expression in prostate cancer cells. Although autocrine signaling of VEGFA has been implicated in prostate cancer progression and metastasis, the associated mechanism is poorly characterized. VEGFA activity is mediated via VEGF receptor (VEGFR) 1 (Flt-1) and 2 (Flk-1/KDR). Whereas VEGFR-1 mRNA was detected in normal prostate epithelial cells, VEGFR-2 mRNA and VEGFR protein were expressed only in PC3 cells. VEGFA(165) treatment induced phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) in PC3 cells but not in HPV7 cells, suggesting that the autocrine function of VEGFA may be uniquely associated with prostate cancer. Activation of VEGFR-2 by VEGFA(165) was shown to enhance migration of PC3 cells. A similar effect was also observed with endogenous VEGFA induced by TGF-Î²1 and hypoxia. These findings illustrate that an autocrine loop of VEGFA via VEGFR-2 is critical for the tumorigenic effects of TGF-Î²1 and hypoxia on metastatic prostate cancers.""","""['Eric Darrington', 'Miao Zhong', 'Bao-Han Vo', 'Shafiq A Khan']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Asian J Androl""","""['Opposite functions of HIF-Î± isoforms in VEGF induction by TGF-Î²1 under non-hypoxic conditions.', 'Differential role of PTEN in transforming growth factor Î² (TGF-Î²) effects on proliferation and migration in prostate cancer cells.', 'Overexpression of transforming growth factor Î²1 in malignant prostate cells is partly caused by a runaway of TGF-Î²1 auto-induction mediated through a defective recruitment of protein phosphatase 2A by TGF-Î² type I receptor.', 'Apigenin inhibits TGF-Î²-induced VEGF expression in human prostate carcinoma cells via a Smad2/3- and Src-dependent mechanism.', 'TGF-Î² Effects on Prostate Cancer Cell Migration and Invasion Require FosB.', 'Vasculogenic Mimicry-An Overview.', 'Neuroprotective Effects of VEGF in the Enteric Nervous System.', 'The Synergistic Cooperation between TGF-Î² and Hypoxia in Cancer and Fibrosis.', 'Functional tissue-engineered microtissue formed by self-aggregation of cells for peripheral nerve regeneration.', 'Psychosocial Stress and Age Influence Depression and Anxiety-Related Behavior, Drive Tumor Inflammatory Cytokines and Accelerate Prostate Cancer Growth in Mice.']"""

The segmented prostate shapes are represented by shape-contexts and the Bhattacharyya distance between the shape representations is used to find the point correspondences between the 2D fixed and moving images. The registration method involves parametric estimation of the non-linear diffeomorphism between the multimodal images and has its basis in solving a set of non-linear equations of thin-plate splines. The solution is obtained as the least-squares solution of an over-determined system of non-linear equations constructed by integrating a set of non-linear functions over the fixed and moving images. However, this may not result in clinically acceptable transformations of the anatomical targets. Therefore, the regularized bending energy of the thin-plate splines along with the localization error of established correspondences should be included in the system of equations.

Education-specific incidence and mortality rate ratios were estimated by means of multivariate Poisson regression models.  Results:   We found both the positive and inverse educational gradients in cancer incidence and mortality. The risk of developing cancer (all sites) was lower among men and women with the lowest education, whereas cancer mortality was higher among lower educated men. The higher educational level was also associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer among men and an increased risk of breast cancer among women. However, prostate cancer mortality was the highest in the lowest education group, whereas breast cancer mortality among women did not show any statistically significant differences. Lower educated men had significantly higher incidence and mortality due to lung and stomach cancers. Strikingly high incidence and mortality due to cervix cancer was observed among women with secondary and lower than secondary education.

To determine the prevalence and clinical significance of the different mechanisms of PTEN inactivation, we analyzed PTEN deletions in TMAs containing 4699 hormone-naÃ¯ve and 57 hormone-refractory prostate cancers using fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis. PTEN mutations and methylation were analyzed in subsets of 149 and 34 tumors, respectively. PTEN deletions were present in 20.2% (458/2266) of prostate cancers, including 8.1% heterozygous and 12.1% homozygous deletions, and were linked to advanced tumor stage (P < 0.0001), high Gleason grade (P < 0.0001), presence of lymph node metastasis (P = 0.0002), hormone-refractory disease (P < 0.0001), presence of ERG gene fusion (P < 0.0001), and nuclear p53 accumulation (P < 0.0001). PTEN deletions were also associated with early prostate-specific antigen recurrence in univariate (P < 0.0001) and multivariate (P = 0.0158) analyses. The prognostic impact of PTEN deletion was seen in both ERG fusion-positive and ERG fusion-negative tumors.

In view of the rising incidence of cancer in sub-Saharan Africa, urgent steps are needed to guide appropriate policy, health sector investment and resource allocation. We posit that hospital based cancer registries (HBCR) are fundamental sources of information on the frequent cancer sites in limited resource regions where population level data is often unavailable. In regions where population based cancer registries are not in existence, HBCR are beneficial for policy and planning.  Materials and methods:   Nineteen of twenty-one cancer registries in Nigeria met the definition of HBCR, and from these registries, we requested data on cancer cases recorded from January 2009 to December 2010. 16 of the 19 registries (84%) responded. Data on year hospital was established; year cancer registry was established, no. of pathologists and types of oncology services available in each tertiary health facility were shown. Analysis of relative frequency of cancers in each HBCR, the basis of diagnosis recorded in the HBCR and the total number of cases recorded by gender was carried out.  Results:   The total number of cancers registered in these 11 hospital based cancer registries in 2009 and 2010 was 6484. The number of new cancer cases recorded annually in these hospital based cancer registries on average was 117 cases in males and I77 cases in females. Breast and cervical cancer were the most common cancers seen in women while prostate cancer was the commonest among men seen in these tertiary hospitals.

Objective:   The aim of this multinational multicentre study was to evaluate prospectively the incidence of infective complications after P-Bx and identify risk factors.  Design, setting, and participants:   The study was performed as an adjunct to the Global Prevalence Study of Infections in Urology (GPIU) during 2010 and 2011. Men undergoing P-Bx in participating centres during the 2-wk period commencing on the GPIU study census day were eligible.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Baseline data were collected and men were questioned regarding infective complications at 2 wk following their biopsy. The Fisher exact test, Student t test, Mann-Whitney U test, and multivariate regression analysis were used for data analysis.  Results and limitations:   A total of 702 men from 84 GPIU participating centres worldwide were included. Antibiotic prophylaxis was administered prior to biopsy in 98.2% of men predominantly using a fluoroquinolone (92.5%). Outcome data were available for 521 men (74%). Symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI) was seen in 27 men (5.2%), which was febrile in 18 (3.5%) and required hospitalisation in 16 (3.1%). Multivariate analysis did not identify any patient subgroups at a significantly higher risk of infection after P-Bx. Causative organisms were isolated in 10 cases (37%) with 6 resistant to fluoroquinolones. The small sample size per participating site and in compared with other studies may have limited the conclusions from our study.  Conclusions:   Infective complications after transrectal P-Bx are important because of the associated patient morbidity.

Methods and materials:   Eleven patients with prostate cancer treated at our institution were randomly selected for this study. For each patient, a VMAT plan and a series of IMRT plans using an increasing number of beams (8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 beams) were examined. All plans were generated using our in-house-developed automatic inverse planning (AIP) algorithm. An existing eight-beam clinical IMRT plan, which was used to treat the patient, was used as the reference plan. For each patient, all AIP-generated plans were optimized to achieve the same level of planning target volume (PTV) coverage as the reference plan. Plan quality was evaluated by measuring mean dose to and dose-volume statistics of the organs at risk, especially the rectum, from each type of plan.  Results:   For the same PTV coverage, the AIP-generated VMAT plans had significantly better plan quality in terms of rectum sparing than the eight-beam clinical and AIP-generated IMRT plans (p < 0.0001). However, the differences between the IMRT and VMAT plans in all the dosimetric indices decreased as the number of beams used in IMRT increased. IMRT plan quality was similar or superior to that of VMAT when the number of beams in IMRT was increased to a certain number, which ranged from 12 to 24 for the set of patients studied. The superior VMAT plan quality resulted in approximately 30% more monitor units than the eight-beam IMRT plans, but the delivery time was still less than 3 min.  Conclusions:   Considering the superior plan quality as well as the delivery efficiency of VMAT compared with that of IMRT, VMAT may be the preferred modality for treating prostate cancer.""","""['Enzhuo M Quan', 'Xiaoqiang Li', 'Yupeng Li', 'Xiaochun Wang', 'Rajat J Kudchadker', 'Jennifer L Johnson', 'Deborah A Kuban', 'Andrew K Lee', 'Xiaodong Zhang']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Assessing the role of volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) relative to IMRT and helical tomotherapy in the management of localized, locally advanced, and post-operative prostate cancer.', 'Efficiency of biological versus physical optimization for single-arc VMAT for prostate and head and neck cases.', 'Treatment planning comparison of IMPT, VMAT and 4Ï radiotherapy for prostate cases.', 'VMAT partial arc technique decreases dose to organs at risk in whole pelvic radiotherapy for prostate cancer when compared to full arc VMAT and IMRT.', 'Urethra-Sparing Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy for Prostate Cancer: Quality Assurance of a Randomized Phase 2 Trial.', 'Reducing the margin in prostate radiotherapy: optimizing radiotherapy with a general-purpose linear accelerator using an in-house position monitoring system.', 'Evaluation of intrafractional prostate displacement during prostate radiotherapy using real-time ultrasound system.', 'Feasibility of 4D VMAT-CT.', 'Sub-arc collimator angle optimization based on the conformity index heatmap for VMAT planning of multiple brain metastases SRS treatments.', 'Evaluation of QA software system analysis for the static picket fence test.']"""

Like other cysteine cathepsins, it is synthesized as an inactive precursor and activated by proteolytic removal of its propeptide. Here we demonstrate that, in human cells, the processing of the propeptide is an autocatalytic, multistep process proceeding from an inactive 41kDa pro-form, through a 30kDa intermediate form, to the 28kDa mature form. Tyr87P and Gly90P were identified as the two major endopeptidase cleavage sites, converting the 30kDa form into the mature 28kDa form. The level of processing differs significantly in different human cell lines. In monocyte-derived macrophages U937 and prostate cancer cells PC-3, the 28kDa form is predominant, whereas in osteoblasts HOS the processing from the 30kDa form to the 28kDa form is significantly lower. The aminopeptidase activity of the enzyme and its subcellular localization are independent of the product, however the 30kDa form was not secreted in HOS cells. The activity of the resulting cathepsin H in U937 cells was significantly lower than that in HOS cells, presumably due to the high levels of endogenous cysteine protease inhibitor cystatin F present specifically in this cell line. These results provide an insight into the dependence of human cathepsin H processing and regulation on cell type.""","""['Matija Rojnik', 'Zala R Jevnikar', 'Bojan Doljak', 'Samo Turk', 'Nace Zidar', 'Janko Kos']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Eur J Cell Biol""","""['Activation processing of cathepsin H impairs recognition by its propeptide.', 'The crystal structure of human procathepsin K.', 'Multiple processing of procathepsin L to cathepsin L in vivo.', 'Cysteine cathepsins as regulators of the cytotoxicity of NK and T cells.', 'Biosynthesis, processing and activity control of cathepsin E.', 'The Key Role of Lysosomal Protease Cathepsins in Viral Infections.', 'Human CD4+ T-Cell Clone Expansion Leads to the Expression of the Cysteine Peptidase Inhibitor Cystatin F.', 'Crystal structures of human procathepsin H.', 'Regulation of split anergy in natural killer cells by inhibition of cathepsins C and H and cystatin F.', 'Cathepsin H mediates the processing of talin and regulates migration of prostate cancer cells.']"""

Prior studies of breast and cervical cancer revealed that cellular adaptation to microenvironmental hypoxia and acidosis is associated with the transition from in situ to invasive cancer. We hypothesized that decreased acidosis in intraductal tumors would alter environmental selection pressures for acid adapted phenotypes and delay or prevent evolution to invasive cancer.  Materials and methods:   A total of 37 C57BL/6 TRAMP mice were randomized to a control group or to 1 of 4 treatment groups. In the latter groups 200 mM sodium bicarbonate were added to drinking water starting between ages 4 and 10 weeks.

When sodium bicarbonate therapy commenced before age 6 weeks in 10 mice, all reached senescence (age 76 weeks) without radiographic evidence of prostate cancer. Histological sections of the prostates in this cohort showed hyperplasia but no cancer in 70% of mice and minimal well differentiated cancer in the remainder. When therapy commenced after age 6 weeks in 9 mice, prostate cancer development was no different from that in controls.

During epithelial to mesenchymal transition epithelial cells down-regulate cell-cell adhesion molecules (ie E-cadherin), up-regulate mesenchymal proteins (ie N-cadherin and cadherin-11), alter polarity, reorganize the cytoskeleton and become isolated. In combination this leads to greater motility. We investigated the role of E-cadherin and the associated catenin-protein complex in regulating epithelial to mesenchymal transition in prostate cancer progression.  Materials and methods:   The relative invasion index of prostate cancer cells was assessed by MTT based in vitro invasion assay. Immunoprecipitation and Western blot were done to determine cadherin-complex formation, and catenin and cadherin protein expression.  Results:   Restoration of E-cadherin expression in nonE-cadherin expressing prostate cancer cells decreased invasive potential. However, in vitro invasive potential was tightly regulated by the interaction of cadherin proteins with the catenin complex. E and N-cadherin, cadherin-11, and the catenin proteins Î±, Î², Î³ and p120 are important for the downstream signaling associated with epithelial to mesenchymal transition in tumor cells.  Conclusions:   Restoration of epithelial specific proteins, such as E-cadherin, in tumor cells can inhibit invasion. However, invasion is a complex process regulated not only by E and N-cadherin but also by catenin-complex proteins.

Design, setting, and participants:   Data were available for 76,813 men aged 55-69 yr coming from four centers of the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC). The presence of metastatic disease was evaluated by imaging or by prostate-specific antigen (PSA) values >100 ng/ml at diagnosis and during follow-up.  Intervention:   Regular screening based on serum PSA measurements was offered to 36270 men randomized to the screening arm, while no screening was provided to the 40543 men in the control arm.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The Nelson-Aalen technique and Poisson regression were used to calculate cumulative incidence and rate ratios of M+ disease.  Results and limitations:   After a median follow-up of 12 yr, 666 men with M+ PCa were detected, 256 in the screening arm and 410 in the control arm, resulting in cumulative incidence of 0.67% and 0.86% per 1000 men, respectively (p<0.001). This finding translated into a relative reduction of 30% (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.70; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.60-0.82; p=0.001) in the intention-to-screen analysis and a 42% (p=0.0001) reduction for men who were actually screened. An absolute risk reduction of metastatic disease of 3.1 per 1000 men randomized (0.31%) was found. A large discrepancy was seen when comparing the rates of M+ detected at diagnosis and all M+ cases that emerged during the total follow-up period, a 50% reduction (HR: 0.50; 95% CI, 0.41-0.62) versus the 30% reduction. The main limitation is incomplete explanation of the lack of an effect of screening during follow-up.  Conclusions:   PSA screening significantly reduces the risk of developing metastatic PCa.

However, a percentage of these patients in active surveillance move on to active treatment. Our aim was to examine urinary incontinence (UI) rates in men who move on to treatment from active surveillance and compare it to quoted rates in the literature. We examined the question that a potential delay in the treatment of prostate cancer in those on active surveillance may result in an increase in incontinence rates.  Materials and methods:   From July 1992 to June 2009, 443 men at our institution entered into active surveillance for newly diagnosed prostate cancer. We reviewed their medical records and data was abstracted from physician-reported medical records. The mean age of the entire group was 64.1 years old (range 40-80). Their mean prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was 7.65 (range 0.21-36) and their mean Gleason score was 6.2 (range 4-8). Of these patients on active surveillance, 150/443 (33.3%) went on to active treatment. Median time to active treatment was 31.5 months (range 3-180 months). Only 5 patients went onto active treatment less than 1 year after starting active surveillance. Of these patients who went onto active treatment, 85 had radiation alone, 48 had a radical prostatectomy (RP), 7 had a RP and radiation, 7 had HIFU alone, 2 had focal ablation and 1 had HIFU followed by salvage RP. Of those undergoing radiation (92 patients), 66 had external beam and 26 had brachytherapy.  Results:   Prior to active treatment 25/443 (5.6%) patients had UI documented in their history. Of those 25 patients only 3 went on to a RP and all had persistent UI after surgery. Two of the 25 patients went on to radiation therapy and their UI resolved. In the active treatment groups, after RP alone, 14/48 (29.2%) patients had new onset UI that persisted at a mean of 47.2 months (range 11-149 months) postoperatively. Of these 14 patients, 7 patients (14.6%) had significant leakage (> 1 pad/day). After radiation therapy alone 2/85(2.4%) had new onset persistent UI at 34 and 49 months post radiation. Only 1/7 (14.3%) patients that had high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) alone had persistent UI at 38 months after HIFU. Of the 7 patients that had both a RP and radiation, 2 had persistent significant UI at 49 and 153 months after surgery. One patient that had HIFU and a RP had persistent UI at 23 months post surgery. The 2 patients that had focal ablation were dry.  Conclusions:   The UI rates in our cohort of active surveillance patients who move on to active treatment are similar to patients who undergo treatment immediately after prostate cancer is diagnosed as quoted in the literature. This suggests that active surveillance, as an initial mode of therapy, does not increase the risk of UI if active treatment occurs at a later date.""","""['Lenny Radomski', 'Johan Gani', 'Greg Trottier', 'Antonio Finelli']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Can J Urol""","""['Re: Active surveillance failure for prostate cancer: does the delay in treatment increase the risk of urinary incontinence?', 'Management of localised prostate cancer: watchful waiting, surgery or radiation therapy, depending on the natural course, which is often relatively slow.', 'HIFU as salvage first-line treatment for palpable, TRUS-evidenced, biopsy-proven locally recurrent prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy: a pilot study.', 'External beam radiotherapy versus radical prostatectomy for clinical stage T1-2 prostate cancer: therapeutic implications of stratification by pretreatment PSA levels and biopsy Gleason scores.', 'Results of high intensity focused ultrasound treatment of prostate cancer: early Canadian experience at a single center.', 'High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) for definitive treatment of prostate cancer.', 'Active surveillance for the management of localized prostate cancer: Guideline recommendations.', 'Timing of curative treatment for prostate cancer: a systematic review.']"""

It can be treated with post-prostatectomy surgical procedures. The long-term rate of patients who undergo these surgeries, including artificial urinary sphincter or urethral sling insertion, is not well described. We examined the long-term rate of post-prostatectomy incontinence surgery and factors influencing it.  Materials and methods:   We performed a population based study of 25,346 men who underwent radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer in Ontario, Canada between 1993 and 2006. We used hospital and cancer registry administrative data to identify patients from this cohort who were later treated with surgery for urinary incontinence.  Results:   Of the 25,346 patients 703 (2.8%) underwent artificial urinary sphincter insertion and 282 (1.1%) underwent urethral sling placement a median of 2.9 years after prostatectomy. The probability of an artificial urinary sphincter/sling procedure increased with time from prostatectomy. Cumulative 5, 10 and 15-year Kaplan-Meier rates of an artificial urinary sphincter/sling procedure were 2.6% (95% CI 2.4-2.8), 3.8% (95% CI 3.6-4.1) and 4.8% (95% CI 4.4-5.3), respectively. Factors predicting surgery for incontinence were patient age at radical prostatectomy (HR 1.24 per decade, 95% CI 1.11-1.38, p = 0.0002), radiotherapy after surgery (HR 1.61, 95% CI 1.36-1.90, p <0.0001) and surgeon volume (49 or greater prostatectomies per year) (HR 0.59, 95% CI 0.46-0.77, p <0.0001).

Four cardiac hormones [i.e. vessel dilator, long-acting natriuretic peptide (LANP), kaliuretic peptide (KP) and atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP)] that eliminate up to up to 86% of human small-cell lung cancers growing in mice were investigated for their effects on VEGF and the VEGFR2/KDR/Flk-1 receptor. The VEGFR2 receptor is the main receptor mediating VEGF's cancer-enhancing effects.  Materials and methods:   Four cardiac hormones were evaluated for their ability to decrease VEGF/VEGFR2 measured by ELISAs in three human cancer cell lines.  Results:   Vessel dilator, LANP, KP and ANP, over a concentration range of 100 pM to 10 Î¼M, maximally decreased the VEGFR2 receptor in human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells by 48%, 49%, 74% and 83%. Vessel dilator, LANP, KP and ANP decreased the VEGFR2 receptor by 77%, 89%, 88% and 67% in human small-cell lung cancer cells and by 48%, 92%, 64% and 71% in human prostate cancer cells. These results were confirmed with the cardiac hormones also decreasing the VEGFR2 receptor measured by Western blots.

Potential roles of SOXs have been demonstrated in various neoplastic tissues as tumor suppressors or promoters depending on tumor status and types. The aim of this study was to investigate the involvement of SOXs in the progression and prognosis of human prostate cancer (PCa).  Methods:   The gene expression changes of SOXs in human PCa tissues compared with non-cancerous prostate tissues was detected using gene expression microarray, and confirmed by real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (QRT-PCR) analysis and immunohositochemistry. The roles of these genes in castration resistance were investigated in LNCaP xenograft model of PCa.  Results:   The microarray analysis identified three genes (SOX7, SOX9 and SOX10) of SOX family that were significantly dis-regulated in common among four PCa specimens. Consistent with the results of the microarray, differential mRNA and protein levels of three selected genes were found in PCa tissues by QRT-PCR analysis and immunohistochemistry. Additionally, we found that the immunohistochemical staining scores of SOX7 in PCa tissues with higher serum PSA level (P = 0.02) and metastasis (P = 0.03) were significantly lower than those with lower serum PSA level and without metastasis; the increased SOX9 protein expression was frequently found in PCa tissues with higher Gleason score (P = 0.02) and higher clinical stage (P < 0.0001); the down-regulation of SOX10 tend to be found in PCa tissues with higher serum PSA levels (P = 0.03) and advanced pathological stage (P = 0.01). Moreover, both univariate and multivariate analyses showed that the down-regulation of SOX7 and the up-regulation of SOX9 were independent predictors of shorter biochemical recurrence-free survival. Furthermore, we discovered that SOX7 was significantly down-regulated and SOX9 was significantly up-regulated during the progression to castration resistance.  Conclusions:   Our data offer the convince evidence that the dis-regulation of SOX7, SOX9 and SOX10 may be associated with the aggressive progression of PCa. SOX7 and SOX9 may be potential markers for prognosis in PCa patients.

AND WHAT DOES THE STUDY ADD?: A significant proportion of patients diagnosed with prostate cancer do not require immediate treatment and could be managed by active surveillance, which usually includes serial measurements of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels and regular biopsies. The rate of rise in PSA levels, which could be calculated as PSA velocity or PSA doubling time, was previously suggested to be associated with the biological aggressiveness of prostate cancer. Although these parameters are obvious candidates for predicting tumour progression in active surveillance patients, earlier studies that examined this topic provided conflicting results. Our analysis showed that PSA velocity and PSA doubling time calculated at different time-points, by different methods, over different intervals, and in different sub-groups of active surveillance patients provide little if any prognostic information. Although we found some significant associations between PSA velocity and the risk of progression as determined by biopsy, the actual clinical significance of this association was small. Furthermore, PSA velocity did not add to the predictive accuracy of total PSA.  Objective:   To study whether prostate-specific antigen (PSA) velocity (PSAV) and PSA doubling time (PSADT) are associated with biopsy progression in patients managed by active surveillance.  Patients and methods:   Our inclusion criteria for active surveillance are biopsy Gleason sum <7, two or fewer positive biopsy cores, â¤20% tumour present in any core, and clinical stage T1-T2a. Changes in any of these parameters during the follow-up that went beyond these limits are considered to be progression. This study included 250 patients who had at least one surveillance biopsy, an available PSA measured no earlier than 3 months before diagnosis, and at least one PSA measurement before each surveillance biopsy. We evaluated the association between PSA kinetics and progression at successive surveillance biopsies in different sub-groups of patients by calculating the area under the curve (AUC) as well as sensitivity and specificity of different thresholds.  Results:   Over a median follow-up of 3.0 years, the disease of 64 (26%) patients progressed. PSADT was not associated with biopsy progression, whereas PSAV was only weakly associated with progression in certain sub-groups. However, incorporation of PSAV in models including total PSA resulted in a moderate increase in AUC only when the entire cohort was analysed. In other sub-groups the predictive accuracy of total PSA was not significantly improved by adding PSAV.  Conclusions:   Our findings confirm that PSA kinetics should not be used in decision-making in patients with low-risk prostate cancer managed by active surveillance. Regular surveillance biopsies should remain as the principal method of monitoring cancer progression in these men.""","""['Viacheslav Iremashvili', 'Murugesan Manoharan', 'Soum D Lokeshwar', 'Daniel L Rosenberg', 'David Pan', 'Mark S Soloway']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Prostate-specific antigen kinetics during follow-up are an unreliable trigger for intervention in a prostate cancer surveillance program.', 'Biopsy features associated with prostate cancer progression in active surveillance patients: comparison of three statistical models.', 'A comparative performance analysis of total prostate-specific antigen, percentage free prostate-specific antigen, prostate-specific antigen velocity and urinary prostate cancer gene 3 in the first, second and third repeat prostate biopsy.', 'Prostate-specific antigen kinetics in clinical decision-making during active surveillance for early prostate cancer--a review.', 'Active surveillance with selective delayed intervention using PSA doubling time for good risk prostate cancer.', 'Active Surveillance for Prostate Cancer: Past, Current, and Future Trends.', 'Prostate-specific antigen velocity in diagnosis and prognosis of prostate cancer - a systematic review.', 'Green tea extract for prevention of prostate cancer progression in patients on active surveillance.', 'Low-risk prostate cancer selected for active surveillance with negative MRI at entry: can repeat biopsies at 1\xa0year be avoided?

We investigated the potential positive effect of clinical trial participation on survival outcomes of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who were treated with first-line docetaxel-containing chemotherapy. After accounting for potential baseline inequalities, participation in a clinical trial itself was associated with significantly longer overall survival in these patients.  Objective:   â¢ To study differences in baseline characteristics and outcomes of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) receiving first-line docetaxel-containing chemotherapy on prospective clinical studies (trial participants) versus those receiving this therapy outside of a clinical study (non-participants).  Patients and methods:   â¢ Records from 247 consecutive chemotherapy-naive patients who were treated with docetaxel-containing chemotherapy for mCRPC at a single high-volume centre from 1998 to 2010 were reviewed. â¢ All patients received docetaxel either as clinical trial participants (n= 142; 11 separate studies) or as non-participants (n= 105). â¢ Univariable and multivariable Cox regression models predicted overall survival after chemotherapy initiation.

Conclusions:   â¢ Patients that were treated with docetaxel for mCRPC showed a significantly longer overall survival when enrolled in a clinical trial. â¢ Improved survival in trial participants may reflect the better medical oversight typically seen in patients enrolled in trials, more regimented follow-up schedules, or a positive effect on caregivers' attitudes because of greater contact with medical services. â¢ With the retrospective nature of this analysis and the small study population, prospective studies are needed to validate the present findings and to further investigate the relationship between clinical trial participation and outcomes.""","""['Jatinder Goyal', 'Philipp Nuhn', 'Peng Huang', 'Prachi Tyagi', 'Daniel Oh', 'Michael A Carducci', 'Mario A Eisenberger', 'Emmanuel S Antonarakis']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Ability of C-reactive protein to complement multiple prognostic classifiers in men with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer receiving docetaxel-based chemotherapy.', 'Rational indication for docetaxel rechallenge in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Association of pretreatment neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and overall survival (OS) in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) treated with first-line docetaxel.', 'Treating Patients with Metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer: A Comprehensive Review of Available Therapies.', 'Docetaxel Activity in the Era of Life-prolonging Hormonal Therapies for Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Clinical Predictors of Early Trial Discontinuation for Patients Participating in Phase I Clinical Trials in Oncology.', 'Analysis of Not Structurable Oncological Study Eligibility Criteria for Improved Patient-Trial Matching.', ""Ambassadors of hope, research pioneers and agents of change-individuals' expectations and experiences of taking part in a randomised trial of an innovative health technology: longitudinal qualitative study."", 'Impact of clinical trial participation on survival in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer: a multi-center analysis.', 'Early identification of sepsis in hospital inpatients by ward nurses increases 30-day survival.']"""

What defines the cellular and molecular predilection for prostate cancer to metastasize to bone marrow is not well understood. CD4(+)CD25(+) regulatory T (Treg) cells contribute to self-tolerance and tumor immune pathology. We now show that functional Treg cells are increased in the bone marrow microenvironment in prostate cancer patients with bone metastasis, and that CXCR4/CXCL12 signaling pathway contributes to Treg cell bone marrow trafficking. Treg cells exhibit active cell cycling in the bone marrow, and bone marrow dendritic cells express high levels of receptor activator of NFÎºB (RANK), and promote Treg cell expansion through RANK and its ligand (RANKL) signals. Furthermore, Treg cells suppress osteoclast differentiation induced by activated T cells and M-CSF, adoptive transferred Treg cells migrate to bone marrow, and increase bone mineral intensity in the xenograft mouse models with human prostate cancer bone marrow inoculation. In vivo Treg cell depletion results in reduced bone density in tumor bearing mice. The data indicates that bone marrow Treg cells may form an immunosuppressive niche to facilitate cancer bone metastasis and contribute to bone deposition, the major bone pathology in prostate cancer patients with bone metastasis. These findings mechanistically explain why Treg cells accumulate in the bone marrow, and demonstrate a previously unappreciated role for Treg cells in patients with prostate cancer. Thus, targeting Treg cells may not only improve anti-tumor immunity, but also ameliorate bone pathology in prostate cancer patients with bone metastasis.""","""['Ende Zhao', 'Lin Wang', 'Jinlu Dai', 'Ilona Kryczek', 'Shuang Wei', 'Linda Vatan', 'Saleh Altuwaijri', 'Tim Sparwasser', 'Guobin Wang', 'Evan T Keller', 'Weiping Zou']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Oncoimmunology""","""['DU145 human prostate cancer cells express functional receptor activator of NFkappaB: new insights in the prostate cancer bone metastasis process.', 'Lack of estrogen down-regulates CXCR4 expression on Treg cells and reduces Treg cell population in bone marrow in OVX mice.', 'CD4+CD25+FOXP3+ T regulatory cells reconstitute and accumulate in the bone marrow of patients with multiple myeloma following allogeneic stem cell transplantation.', 'Thymic commitment of regulatory T cells is a pathway of TCR-dependent selection that isolates repertoires undergoing positive or negative selection.', 'Bone Marrow Microenvironment as a Regulator and Therapeutic Target for Prostate Cancer Bone Metastasis.', 'New insights and options into the mechanisms and effects of combined targeted therapy and immunotherapy in prostate cancer.', 'Immune determinants of the pre-metastatic niche.', 'Adaptor proteins mediate CXCR4 and PI4KA crosstalk in prostate cancer cells and the significance of PI4KA in bone tumor growth.', 'Impact of Immune Cells in the Tumor Microenvironment of Prostate Cancer Metastasis.', 'The tumor-immune ecosystem in shaping metastasis.']"""

Results:   Comparing HbA1c >58 mmol/mol with â¤ 58 mmol/mol, adjusted HR for all cancer was 1.02 [95% CI 0.95-1.10] using baseline HbA1c, and 1.04 [95% CI 0.97-1.12] using updated mean HbA1c, and HRs were all non-significant for specific cancers of gastrointestinal, kidney and urinary organs, respiratory organs, female genital organs, breast or prostate. Similarly, no increased risks of all cancer or the specific types of cancer were found with higher quartiles of baseline or updated mean HbA1c, compared to the lowest quartile. HR for all cancer was 1.01 [0.98-1.04] per 1%-unit increase in HbA1c used as a continuous variable, with non-significant HRs also for the specific types of cancer per unit increase in HbA1c.

The fusion RNA and protein products often play causal roles in tumorigenesis and therefore represent ideal diagnostic and therapeutic targets. Formerly, fusion chimeric products in cancer were thought to be produced solely by chromosomal translocation. Here, we show that a chimeric SLC45A3-ELK4 RNA is generated in the absence of chromosomal rearrangement. We showed that it is not a product of RNA trans-splicing, but formed by cis-splicing of adjacent genes/read-through. The binding of CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) to the insulator sequences inversely correlates with the expression of the chimera transcript. The SLC45A3-ELK4 fusion, but not wild-type, ELK4 plays important roles in regulating cell growth in both androgen-dependent and -independent prostate cancer cells. The level of the chimeric transcript correlates with disease progression, with the highest levels in prostate cancer metastases. Our results suggest that gene fusions can arise from cis-splicing of adjacent genes without corresponding DNA changes.  Significance:   With the absence of corresponding DNA rearrangement, chimeric fusion SLC45A3-ELK4 transcript in prostate cancer cells is generated by cis-splicing of adjacent genes/gene read-through instead of trans-splicing.

Prior studies have shown that free PSA (fPSA), intact PSA (iPSA) and human kallikrein-related peptidase 2 (hK2) are eliminated more rapidly after radical prostatectomy. In contrast, all three markers have similarly slow elimination rates after castration induced by gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists, possibly due to the slow onset of castration. Therefore, we assessed elimination rates of tPSA, fPSA, iPSA and hK2 after rapid induction of castration with degarelix (Firmagon(Â®)), a novel GnRH antagonist.  Methods:   This study included 24 patients treated with degarelix. Blood was taken at 1, 3, 7, 14, 21 and 28 days after injection of degarelix. Free and total PSA were measured with a commercial dual-label assay, and with inhouse research assays of intact PSA and hK2.  Results:   Median (interquartile range, IQR) tPSA at baseline was 23.4 (15.8, 59.8). Twenty-two patients (92 % ) reached castrate levels of testosterone within 24 h of degarelix initiation, and all patients did so within 72 h. All kallikrein forms declined in an exponential fashion after degarelix administration. The median time to 50 % reduction in biomarker level was 8 â 9 days for tPSA or complexed PSA vs. 2-4 days for hK2, iPSA and fPSA. The percentage eliminated at day 3 and day 7 was significantly higher for hK2, iPSA and fPSA than for tPSA (all p < 0.02), while tPSA and complexed PSA were similar.  Conclusions:   The rapid decline of fPSA, iPSA and hK2 after fast induction of castration with degarelix is similar to that reported after prostatectomy and offers a novel, informative method to monitor rapid onset of therapeutic action targeting signaling of the androgen receptor.""","""['David Ulmert', 'Andrew J Vickers', 'Howard I Scher', 'Charlotte Becker', 'Peter Iversen', 'David Frankel', 'Jens-Kristian Jensen', 'Tine Kold Olesen', 'Hans Lilja']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Clin Chem Lab Med""","""['Similar rates of exponential decrease in serum concentrations of free prostate-specific antigen (PSA), PSA complexed to alpha-1-antichymotrypsin, and human glandular kallikrein 2 (hK2) in prostate cancer patients treated with GnRH-analogues.', 'Human glandular kallikrein as a tool to improve discrimination of poorly differentiated and non-organ-confined prostate cancer compared with prostate-specific antigen.', 'Risk assessment for biochemical recurrence prior to radical prostatectomy: significant enhancement contributed by human glandular kallikrein 2 (hK2) and free prostate specific antigen (PSA) in men with moderate PSA-elevation in serum.', 'Screening for prostate cancer in 2008 II: the importance of molecular subforms of prostate-specific antigen and tissue kallikreins.', 'Degarelix: a gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist for the management of prostate cancer.', 'Treatment with a GnRH receptor agonist, but not the GnRH receptor antagonist degarelix, induces atherosclerotic plaque instability in ApoE(-/-) mice.', 'An update on the use of degarelix in the treatment of advanced hormone-dependent prostate cancer.']"""

During the development of this disease, prostate cancer cells enter the bloodstream as single cells or clusters of cells. Prostate fibroblasts, a cancer-promoting cell type in the prostate cancer microenvironment, could in theory incorporate into these migrating cell clusters or follow cancer cells into the bloodstream through holes in the tumor vasculature. Based on this idea, we hypothesized that fibroblast-like cells, defined here as cytokeratin 8/18/19(-) /DAPI(+) /CD45(-) /vimentin(+) cells, are present in the blood of men with metastatic prostate cancer.  Methods:   Veridex's CellSearchÂ® system was used to immunomagnetically capture EpCAM(+) cells and clusters of cells heterogeneous for EpCAM expression from the blood of men with metastatic prostate cancer, localized cancer, and no known cancer, and immunostain them for the presence of cytokeratins 8/18/19, a nucleus, CD45, and vimentin. Fibroblast-like cells were then quantified.  Results:   Fibroblast-like cells were present in 58.3% of men with metastatic prostate cancer but not in any men with localized prostate cancer or no known cancer. The presence of these cells correlated with certain known indicators of poor prognosis: â¥ 5 circulating tumor cells, defined here as cytokeratin 8/18/19(+) /DAPI(+) /CD45(-) cells, per 7.5 ml of blood, and a relatively high serum prostate-specific antigen level of â¥ 20 ng/ml.

The goal of this study is to test association between HOXB13 genetic variants and PCa risk in Chinese men.  Methods:   All study subjects were part of the Chinese Consortium for Prostate Cancer Genetics (ChinaPCa). In the first stage, we screened for mutations by sequencing the HOXB13 coding region in 96 unrelated PCa patients. In stage 2, G84E and novel mutations found in stage 1 were genotyped in 671 PCa patients and 1,536 controls. In stage 3, mutation status in 751 additional PCa patients was imputed via haplotype.  Results:   The G84E mutation was not detected in this study. However, a novel mutation, G135E, was identified among 96 patients in stage 1. It was also observed twice in 575 additional PCa patients but not in 1,536 control subjects of stage 2. The frequency of G135E was significantly different between cases and controls, with a P-value of 0.027, based on Fisher's exact test. Haplotype estimation showed that G135E mutation carriers shared a unique haplotype that was not observed in other subjects. In stage 3, two more PCa patients were predicted to carry the G135E mutation.  Conclusions:   We identified a novel rare mutation in the HOXB13 gene, G135E, which appears to be a founder mutation.

Methods:   TRUS prostate biopsies from 170 patients with suspected PCa were used to measure the mRNA levels of AMACR and survivin using semi-quantitative RT-PCR technique. The diagnosis, staging and risk stratification of PCa was based on established clinical criteria. The ability of tissue mRNA levels to distinguish benign from malignant prostate and high- and low-risk PCa was assessed. The diagnostic value for the two genes was evaluated by calculating their individual and combined sensitivity and specificity, which were compared with that of PSA.  Results:   Histological examination showed 90/170 (53%) of patients had benign prostate pathology, while 80/170 (47%) had PCa. Tissue mRNA levels of both AMACR and survivin were able to distinguish benign from PCa biopsies (p<0.0001) and also high-risk from low-risk PCa cases (p<0.02, p<0.05, respectively). Compared with serum PSA levels, the combined use of tissue mRNA levels of AMACR and survivin yielded a higher detection specificity (84 vs. 22%).

Methods and materials:   Between 2007 and 2011, 88 men without clinically palpable disease underwent eMRI for detectable prostate-specific antigen (PSA) after RP. The median interval between RP and eMRI was 32 months (interquartile range, 14-57 months), and the median PSA level was 0.30 ng/mL (interquartile range, 0.19-0.72 ng/mL). Magnetic resonance imaging scans consisting of T2-weighted, diffusion-weighted, and dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging were evaluated for features consistent with local recurrence. The prostate bed was scored from 0-4, whereby 0 was definitely normal, 1 probably normal, 2 indeterminate, 3 probably abnormal, and 4 definitely abnormal. Local recurrence was defined as having a score of 3-4.  Results:   Local recurrence was identified in 21 men (24%). Abnormalities were best appreciated on T2-weighted axial images (90%) as focal hypointense lesions. Recurrence locations were perianastomotic (67%) or retrovesical (33%). The only risk factor associated with local recurrence was PSA; recurrence was seen in 37% of men with PSA >0.3 ng/mL vs 13% if PSA â¤0.3 ng/mL (P<.01). The median volume of recurrence was 0.26 cm(3) and was directly associated with PSA (r=0.5, P=.02).

In the present study, DU145 human prostate cancer cells were cultured with 0-25 Î¼m-maslinic acid to examine the effects of maslinic acid on the metastatic capacity of prostate cancer cells. Maslinic acid significantly (P <0.05) inhibited the basal and epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced migration (27-64 %), invasion (23-60 %) and adhesion (8-40 %) of DU145 cells. Maslinic acid significantly (P <0Â·05) down-regulated both basal and EGF-stimulated secretion of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 (25-67 %), MMP-2 (50-86 %), urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA, about 100 %), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF, 98-100 %) and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMP)-1, as well as expression of uPA receptor (uPAR), intercellular adhesion molecules (22-33 %), vascular cell adhesion molecules (23-46 %) and E-cadherin, whereas it increased TIMP-2 secretion. Maslinic acid dramatically reduced the levels of hypoxia-inducible factor-1Î± (HIF-1Î±) protein and mRNA; the reduction was accompanied by reduced stability, nuclear levels and transcriptional activity of HIF-1Î±. The levels of phospho-Akt and phospho-extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) were reduced in cells treated with maslinic acid, and the phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 and the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase inhibitor PD98059 reduced HIF-1Î± levels and VEGF secretion. The results show that maslinic acid markedly inhibited the migration, invasion and adhesion of DU145 prostate cancer cells. Suppressing HIF-1Î± activation by inhibiting Akt and ERK activation may be part of the mechanism by which maslinic acid inhibited uPAR, E-cadherin, VEGF and MMP expression in DU145 cells.""","""['So Young Park', 'Chu Won Nho', 'Dae Young Kwon', 'Young-Hee Kang', 'Ki Won Lee', 'Jung Han Yoon Park']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Br J Nutr""","""['Isoliquiritigenin inhibits migration and invasion of prostate cancer cells: possible mediation by decreased JNK/AP-1 signaling.', 'Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, P276-00, inhibits HIF-1Î± and induces G2/M arrest under hypoxia in prostate cancer cells.', 'Magnolol suppresses hypoxia-induced angiogenesis via inhibition of HIF-1Î±/VEGF signaling pathway in human bladder cancer cells.', 'Unraveling galectin-1 as a novel therapeutic target for cancer.', 'Melatonin as an angiogenesis inhibitor to combat cancer: Mechanistic evidence.', 'Maslinic Acid: A New Compound for the Treatment of Multiple Organ Diseases.', 'Maslinic Acid Inhibits the Growth of Malignant Gliomas by Inducing Apoptosis via MAPK Signaling.', 'Transcriptome and proteome analysis of the antitumor activity of maslinic acid against pancreatic cancer cells.', 'The Anticancer Potential of Maslinic Acid and Its Derivatives: A Review.', 'Assessment of the Antiangiogenic and Anti-Inflammatory Properties of a Maslinic Acid Derivative and its Potentiation using Zinc Chloride.']"""

A single nucleotide polymorphism in murine double minute 2 promoter, SNP309 T>G, has been reported to alter murine double minute 2 protein expression and to accelerate tumor formation in humans. We carried out a meta-analysis to explore the association between this polymorphism and prostate cancer risk.  Methods:   All eligible studies were searched in PubMed. Crude odds ratios, with 95% confidence intervals, were assessed for the association using fixed- and random-effects models.  Results:   Overall, five case-control studies (872 cases, 1005 controls) were included in the meta-analysis. A significant association between murine double minute 2 SNP309 and prostate cancer risk was observed for homozygote genetic model GG versus TT (odds ratio 0.72, 95% confidence interval 0.55-0.95, P < 0.05, P = 0.130 for heterogeneity), and for dominant model TG + GG versus TT (odds ratio 0.79, 95% confidence interval 0.65-0.96, P < 0.05, P = 0.119 for heterogeneity). The stratified analysis based on ethnicity showed a significant effect of the polymorphism on prostate cancer risk in Caucasians for GG versus TT.  Conclusions:   Findings of the present meta-analysis suggest that the murine double minute 2 309 G allele might be associated with a reduced risk of prostate cancer.

Methods:   An Action Threshold (AT), defined as the maximum acceptable discrepancy between measured dose and dose calculated with the Treatment Planning System (TPS) (for each field) has been determined from phantom data. To investigate the sensitivity of the system to direction of the patient movements, fixed displacements have been simulated in phantom. The AT has been used as an indicator to establish if patients move during a treatment session, after having verified the set-up with 2D and/or 3D images. Phantom tests have been performed matching different linear accelerators and two TPSs (TPS1 and TPS2).  Results:   The ATs have been found to be very similar (5.0% for TPS1 and 4.5% for TPS2). From statistical data analysis, the system has been found not sensitive enough to reveal displacements smaller than 1 cm (within two standard deviations). The ATs applied to in vivo treatments showed that among the twenty five patients treated for breast cancer, only four of them moved during each measurement session. Splitting data into medial and lateral field, two patients have been found to move during all these sessions; the others, instead, moved only in the second part of the treatment. Patients with prostate cancer have behaved better than patients with breast cancer. Only two out of twenty five moved in each measurement session.

It is assumed that the tumor microenvironment of the prostate contributes to invasion and metastasis. Stroma-epithelial crosstalk has shown to change with progression of prostate cancer, and thereby the stromal compartment might be an attractive target in diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to prostate cancer. The purpose of this project was to study the reciprocal influence between fibroblasts and cancer cells in prostate cancer. Prostate fibroblast primary cultures from areas with cancer and hyperplasia were cocultivated with cells of the PC-3 lineage. Gene expression profiles of both cell types were studied to reveal possible associations to cancer invasion and metastasis. There were 383 differentially expressed genes between fibroblasts from cancerous areas and fibroblasts from areas with hyperplasia before cocultivation with PC-3 cells. Several of the differentially expressed gene classes are associated with cancer development and metastasis. After cocultivation, there were 26 differentially expressed genes between cancerous and hyperplastic fibroblasts. There were only three differentially expressed genes between PC-3 cells that had been cocultivated with cancerous fibroblasts and PC-3 cells that had been cocultivated with hyperplastic fibroblasts. The fibroblasts from cancer areas showed a different expression pattern from the characteristics reported as reactive stroma in previous studies. We found tenascin C to be downregulated, which is contrary to previous findings. TGF-Î²3 and TGF-Î²R3 were also downregulated, which has been associated with disturbance of TGF-Î² signaling during prostate cancer progression. Cocultivation with PC-3 cells seems to make the cancerous and hyperplastic fibroblasts more alike each other, as the number of differentially expressed genes decreases. It is desirable to find out if the reduction in differential gene expression is attributable to that hyperplastic fibroblasts become more alike the cancerous fibroblasts or vice versa. Also, we think that the lower expression levels of c-Jun and c-Fos in cancerous fibroblasts without coculture may cause loss of normal fibroblast differentiation, proliferation and inflammatory response, and hence, favor the proliferation and invasion of cancer cells.""","""['Tove Reinertsen', 'Jostein Halgunset', 'Trond Viset', 'Arnar Flatberg', 'Linn Lervik Haugsmoen', 'Haakon Skogseth']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""APMIS""","""['Fibroblast and prostate tumor cell cross-talk: fibroblast differentiation, TGF-Î², and extracellular matrix down-regulation.', 'Reactive stroma in human prostate cancer: induction of myofibroblast phenotype and extracellular matrix remodeling.', 'Profiling molecular targets of TGF-beta1 in prostate fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transdifferentiation.', 'Molecular insights into prostate cancer progression: the missing link of tumor microenvironment.', 'Gene expression profiling in prostatic cancer.', 'Molecular Characterization of Cancer Associated Fibroblasts in Prostate Cancer.', 'Stroma-derived extracellular vesicle mRNA signatures inform histological nature of prostate cancer.', 'Human Bocavirus Infection of Permanent Cells Differentiated to Air-Liquid Interface Cultures Activates Transcription of Pathways Involved in Tumorigenesis.', 'Prostate cancer cells specifically reorganize epithelial cell-fibroblast communication through proteoglycan and junction pathways.', 'A New Combinatorial Optimization Approach for Integrated Feature Selection Using Different Datasets: A Prostate Cancer Transcriptomic Study.']"""

However, little is known about this pathway in patients with non-metastatic PC. We aimed to investigate whether changes of RANKL, its inhibitor osteoprotegerin (OPG) and bone marrow-mesenchymal stromal cells (BM-MSCs) occur in PC patients without manifest bone metastases.  Patients and methods:   We determined OPG and soluble RANKL (sRANKL) in serum and corresponding bone marrow (BM) samples of 140 patients before radical prostatectomy by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). As control serum samples of 50 patients with benign prostate hyperplasia were analyzed. BM mononuclear cells (BMNCs) of 16 PC patients were analyzed for expression of RANKL and CD271 (as marker for MSCs) by flow cytometry.  Results:   PC patients had significantly lower serum levels of OPG compared to BPH patients (P = 0.007), whereas no differences were observed for serum sRANKL (P = 0.74). Both OPG and sRANKL concentrations of serum and corresponding BM samples correlated significantly (P < 0.0001 each). Interestingly, in PC patients, lower serum and BM OPG levels were associated with a higher proportion of BM-MSCs (P = 0.04 and 0.0016, respectively). No correlations were observed for sRANKL, OPG, BM-MSCs, and established risk parameters of PC.  Discussion:   The results of the study indicate that localized PC is associated with early specific changes of the RANKL pathway in serum and bone marrow (BM).

We compare three estimators of the causal effect of treatment on compliers when this is a parameter in a proportional hazards model and quantify the bias due to omitting baseline prognostic factors. Causal estimates are found directly by maximising a novel partial likelihood; based on a structural proportional hazards model; and based on a 'corrected dataset' derived after fitting a rank-preserving structural failure time model. Where necessary, we extend these methods to incorporate baseline covariates. Comparisons use simulated data and a real data example. Analysing the simulated data, we found that all three methods are accurate when an important covariate was included in the proportional hazards model (maximum bias 5.4%). However, failure to adjust for this prognostic factor meant that causal treatment effects were underestimated (maximum bias 11.4%), because estimators were based on a misspecified marginal proportional hazards model. Analysing the real data example, we found that adjusting causal estimators is important to correct for residual imbalances in prognostic factors present between trial arms after randomisation.

Methods:   We evaluated the G84E germline mutation (rs138213197) of HOXB13 in a case-control study of familial prostate cancer at Vanderbilt University (Nashville, TN) to independently evaluate the association of the mutation with familial prostate cancer. We genotyped 928 familial prostate cancer probands and 930 control probands without a personal or family history of prostate cancer.  Results:   Our study confirmed the association between the G84E mutation of HOXB13 and risk of prostate cancer among subjects of European descent. We observed the mutation in 16 familial cases and in two controls, each as heterozygotes. The odds ratio (OR) for prostate cancer was 7.9 [95% confidence interval, (CI) 1.8-34.5, P = 0.0062] among carriers of the mutation. The carrier rate was 1.9% among all familial case probands and 2.7% among probands of pedigrees with â¥3 affected. In a separate case series of 268 probands of European descent with no additional family history of prostate cancer, the carrier rate was 1.5%.

Here, we report that less differentiated stem-like cells in the basal compartment of human and mouse prostate contain lower levels of the polycomb heterochromatin marker H3K27me3 than more differentiated luminal cells. This link to differentiated normal cells is also found in a number of other human and rodent tissues characterized by hierarchical differentiation. In addition to MYC's traditional role as a gene-specific transcription factor, recent studies indicate that MYC also affects global chromatin structure where it is required to maintain ""open"" or active chromatin. We now demonstrate that in both MYC-driven prostate cancers in mice and human prostate cancers, global levels of H3K27me3 are reduced in prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and invasive adenocarcinoma lesions. Moreover, decreased levels of H3K27me3 correlate with increased markers of disease aggressiveness (eg, Gleason score and pathological stage). In vitro, experimentally forced reductions in MYC levels result in increased global levels of H3K27me3.

Agonists activate the GnRH receptor (GnRH-R), triggering apoptosis in PCa cells. In gonadotropes, the amount of GnRH-R in the plasma membrane is regulated by protein folding and endoplasmic reticulum retention, mechanisms that can be overcome by the pharmacoperone IN3. Our aim was to describe the intracellular distribution of GnRH-R in PCa cells and its relation to response to GnRH analog treatments. The expressions of GnRH-R in PCa biopsies were evaluated by immunohistochemistry and the intracellular distribution was determined by immunofluorescence in primary cell cultures from human PCa samples. Cultured cells were pretreated with IN3 and then with leuprolide. Cell survival was evaluated by 1-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-3,5-diphenylformazan (MTT) thiazolyl blue formazan and cell cycle and apoptosis by flow cytometry. We observed that the expression of GnRH-R decreased according to malignant progression. Most GnRH-R are located inside the cell, colocalizing with endoplasmic reticulum markers. The treatment with IN3 decreased cellular GnRH-R retention, increasing plasma membrane expression in approximately 60%. Pretreatment with IN3 decreased PCa cell survival compared with leuprolide-alone treatment, primarily because of an increase in apoptosis. We conclude that the response of PCa cells to leuprolide is related to the amount of GnRH-R in the plasma membrane. Therefore, pretreatment evaluation of the amount of these receptors may be a predictor of the outcome of leuprolide treatment in PCa patients.

To identify genes in synthetic lethality with Chk1, we did a high-throughput screening using a siRNA library directed against 719 human protein kinases in the human ovarian cancer cell line OVCAR-5, resistant to Chk1 inhibitors. Wee1 tyrosine kinase was the most significant gene in synthetic lethality with Chk1. Treatment with non-toxic concentrations of a Chk1 inhibitor (PF-00477736) and a Wee1 inhibitor (MK-1775) confirmed the marked synergistic effect in various human cancer cell lines (breast, ovarian, colon, prostate), independently of the p53 status. Detailed molecular analysis showed that the combination caused cancer cells to undergo premature mitosis before the end of DNA replication, with damaged DNA leading to cell death partly by apoptosis. In vivo treatment of mice bearing OVCAR-5 xenografts with the combination of Chk1 and Wee1 inhibitors led to greater tumor growth inhibition than with the inhibitors used as single agents with no toxicity.

In several cases, CT imaging is needed only for dose calculation and generation of digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs). Image co-registration errors between MRI and CT can be avoided by using MRI-only based treatment planning, especially in the pelvis. Since electron density information can not be directly derived from the MRI, a method is needed to convert MRI data into CT like data. We investigated whether there is a relationship between MRI intensity and Hounsfield unit (HU) values for the pelvic bones. The aim was to generate a method to convert bone MRI intensity into HU data surrogate for RT treatment planning.  Material and methods:   The HU conversion model was generated for 10 randomly chosen prostate cancer patients and independent validation was performed in another 10 patients. Data consisted of 800 image voxels chosen within the pelvic bones in both T1/T2*-weighted gradient echo and CT images. Relation between MRI intensity and electron density was derived from calibrated HU-values. The proposed method was tested by constructing five ""pseudo""-CT series.  Results:   We found that the MRI intensity is related to the HU value within a HU range from 0 to 1400 within the pelvic bones. The mean prediction error of the conversion model was 135 HU. Dose calculation based on the pseudo-CT images was accurate and the generated DRRs were of good quality.  Conclusions:   The proposed method enables generation of clinically relevant pseudo-CT data for the pelvic bones from one MRI series. It is simpler than previously reported approaches which require either acquisition of several MRI series or T2* maps with special imaging sequences. The method can be applied with commercial clinical image processing software.

Full elucidation of the genetic etiology of prostate cancer is difficult because of incomplete penetrance and genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity. Current evidence suggests that genetic linkage to prostate cancer has been found on several chromosomes including the X; however, identification of causative genes has been elusive.  Methods:   Parametric and non-parametric linkage analyses were performed using 26 microsatellite markers in each of 11 groups of multiple-case prostate cancer families from the International Consortium for Prostate Cancer Genetics (ICPCG). Meta-analyses of the resultant family-specific linkage statistics across the entire 1,323 families and in several predefined subsets were then performed.  Results:   Meta-analyses of linkage statistics resulted in a maximum parametric heterogeneity lod score (HLOD) of 1.28, and an allele-sharing lod score (LOD) of 2.0 in favor of linkage to Xq27-q28 at 138 cM. In subset analyses, families with average age at onset less than 65 years exhibited a maximum HLOD of 1.8 (at 138 cM) versus a maximum regional HLOD of only 0.32 in families with average age at onset of 65 years or older. Surprisingly, the subset of families with only 2-3 affected men and some evidence of male-to-male transmission of prostate cancer gave the strongest evidence of linkage to the region (HLOD = 3.24, 134 cM). For this subset, the HLOD was slightly increased (HLOD = 3.47 at 134 cM) when families used in the original published report of linkage to Xq27-28 were excluded.  Conclusions:   Although there was not strong support for linkage to the Xq27-28 region in the complete set of families, the subset of families with earlier age at onset exhibited more evidence of linkage than families with later onset of disease. A subset of families with 2-3 affected individuals and with some evidence of male to male disease transmission showed stronger linkage signals. Our results suggest that the genetic basis for prostate cancer in our families is much more complex than a single susceptibility locus on the X chromosome, and that future explorations of the Xq27-28 region should focus on the subset of families identified here with the strongest evidence of linkage to this region.""","""['Joan E Bailey-Wilson', 'Erica J Childs', 'Cheryl D Cropp', 'Daniel J Schaid', 'Jianfeng Xu', 'Nicola J Camp', 'Lisa A Cannon-Albright', 'James M Farnham', 'Asha George', 'Isaac Powell', 'John D Carpten', 'Graham G Giles', 'John L Hopper', 'Gianluca Severi', 'Dallas R English', 'William D Foulkes', 'Lovise MÃ¦hle', 'PÃ¥l MÃ¸ller', 'Rosalind Eeles', 'Douglas Easton', 'Michelle Guy', 'Steve Edwards', 'Michael D Badzioch', 'Alice S Whittemore', 'Ingrid Oakley-Girvan', 'Chih-Lin Hsieh', 'Latchezar Dimitrov', 'Janet L Stanford', 'Danielle M Karyadi', 'Kerry Deutsch', 'Laura McIntosh', 'Elaine A Ostrander', 'Kathleen E Wiley', 'Sarah D Isaacs', 'Patrick C Walsh', 'Stephen N Thibodeau', 'Shannon K McDonnell', 'Scott Hebbring', 'Ethan M Lange', 'Kathleen A Cooney', 'Teuvo L J Tammela', 'Johanna Schleutker', 'Christiane Maier', 'Sylvia Bochum', 'Josef Hoegel', 'Henrik GrÃ¶nberg', 'Fredrik Wiklund', 'Monica Emanuelsson', 'Geraldine Cancel-Tassin', 'Antoine Valeri', 'Olivier Cussenot', 'William B Isaacs;International Consortium for Prostate Cancer Genetics']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""BMC Med Genet""","""['Combined analysis of hereditary prostate cancer linkage to 1q24-25: results from 772 hereditary prostate cancer families from the International Consortium for Prostate Cancer Genetics.', 'Results of a genome-wide linkage analysis in prostate cancer families ascertained through the ACTANE consortium.', 'Linkage of prostate cancer susceptibility loci to chromosome 1.', 'An Update on Genetic Predisposition for Prostate Cancer: Perspectives and Prospects.', 'New insights and candidate genes and their implications for care of patients with hereditary prostate cancer.', 'Two-stage Study of Familial Prostate Cancer by Whole-exome Sequencing and Custom Capture Identifies 10 Novel Genes Associated with the Risk of Prostate Cancer.', 'The genetic epidemiology of prostate cancer and its clinical implications.', 'Prostate cancer risk-associated genetic markers and their potential clinical utility.']"""

Apoptosis was evaluated by Annexin V staining of externalized phosphatidylserine by flow cytometry. Expression of protein was analyzed by Western blotting. Localization of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) was detected by immunocytochemistry. RNA interference was employed to inhibit expression of specific protein. We found here that combining curcumin with MSeA led to a significantly enhanced apoptosis in both MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells and DU145 prostate cancer cells. Further mechanistic investigations revealed that curcumin treatment alone caused a concentration dependent upregulation of Mcl-1, which can be overcome by combining it with MSeA. In line with the Mcl-1 reduction, an enhanced mitochondrial permeability transition and AIF nuclear translocation by the combination were achieved. In addition, an increased suppression of focal adhesion kinase activity was observed in the combination-treated cells which were associated with cell detachment-induced apoptosis by the combination.

The aims of this meta-analysis were to understand whether it is oncologically safe or advantageous to combine the two procedures in terms of subsequent overall recurrences with particular interest to that in the prostatic fossa and to understand whether some characteristics of the bladder tumors can influence the recurrence rate.  Methods:   A bibliographic search covering the period from January 1950 to December 2011 was conducted in PubMed, MEDLINE and EMBASE. Meta-analysis approach was applied comparing prostatic fossa recurrences and total recurrences in simultaneous TURBT and TURP and control. Also, prostatic fossa recurrences and tumors' grading and multifocality in patients treated with simultaneous TURBT and TURP were analyzed. To investigate to what extent observational time influenced relapses/recurrence, a random effect meta-regression logistic model-based approach was applied. All statistical evaluations were performed using SAS version 9.2 and by RevMan 5.0. An Î± level of 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.  Results:   Overall, there were 1,234 participants in the eight studies considered. The study group consists of 634 patients and the control group 600. Mean age was 67.88 and 61.64 years, respectively, in the study and control groups. In the study group, on a total of 634 patients, 65 recurrences in the prostatic fossa appear. In the control group, on a total of 600 patients, 58 recurrences in the prostatic fossa occurred. Data do not show a statistically significant difference in recurrence in the prostatic fossa between patients treated simultaneously with TURB and TURP and the control group. Meta-analysis does not show a statistically significant difference in recurrence in the prostatic fossa with the increased grading of the neoplasms. But there is a statistically significant increased recurrence in patients with multifocal tumors. There is a statistically significant reduction in recurrence between patients treated simultaneously with TURB and TURP and the control group, but there is no reduction in the recurrence rate in the time.  Conclusions:   This meta-analysis emphasized that the two operations could be performed during the same session without any negative oncologic results. The resolution during the same session of bladder outlet obstruction will improve the patients' quality of life and performing the procedures in the same session sparing the patients from a further anesthesiological maneuvers and the need for a further hospitalization for the surgical resolution of the prostatic obstruction.""","""['Stefano C M Picozzi', 'Cristian Ricci', 'Maddalena Gaeta', 'Stefano Casellato', 'Giorgio Bozzini', 'Dario Ratti', 'Luca Carmignani']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Int Urol Nephrol""","""['Oncological and safety profiles in patients undergoing simultaneous transurethral resection (TUR) of bladder tumour and TUR of the prostate.', 'Simultaneous transurethral resection of bladder tumor and benign prostatic hyperplasia: hazardous or a safe timesaver?', 'Oncological safety and quality of life in men undergoing simultaneous transurethral resection of bladder tumor and prostate: results from a randomized controlled trial.', 'Simultaneous transurethral resection of bladder tumour and prostate: is it safe?', 'Upper urinary tract recurrence following radical cystectomy for bladder cancer: a meta-analysis on 13,185 patients.', 'Oncological safety of simultaneous transurethral resection of high-grade urothelial carcinoma of the bladder and benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'Concomitant Endoscopic Surgery for Bladder Tumors and Prostatic Obstruction: Are We Safely Hitting Two Birds with One Stone?

Methods:   We developed a predictive model incorporating clinicopathological tumor variables, patient age, comorbidity status, and primary treatment modality. We identified 6091 patients with clinically-localized prostate cancer managed with radical prostatectomy (n=4117) or radiation therapy (n=1974) from the Cancer of the Prostate Strategic Urologic Research Endeavor database. Fine and Gray competing-risks proportional hazards regression models were used to calculate the risks of prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM) and non-prostate cancer death and to generate a nomogram.  Results:   The median follow-up after treatment was 53 months (interquartile range 30, 80 months). In total, 983 men died during follow-up, including 167 who died of prostate cancer and 816 who died of non-prostate cancer causes. On multivariate analysis, higher Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment score and primary treatment with radiation were associated with an increased risk of PCSM, whereas older age, African-American race, and treatment with radiation predicted non-prostate cancer death. The number of comorbidities and receipt of androgen deprivation therapy correlated with an increased risk of non-prostate cancer death, but not PCSM. The resulting nomogram allows quantification and comparison of the 10-year risk of PCSM and non-prostate cancer death.  Conclusions:   Integrating clinicopathological variables with comorbid conditions in a competing-risks model affords quantification and comparison of relative probabilities of PCSM and non-prostate cancer death following treatment.

Results:   A total of 6,353 men were diagnosed with PCa and 731 died of PCa during mean follow-up of 12 years. A weak negative association was found between levels of calcium or albumin-corrected calcium and PCa risk (HR for quartiles of albumin-corrected calcium: 0.95 (0.89-1.02), 0.93 (0.86-1.00), and 0.91 (0.85-0.98) for the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th quartile compared to the 1st; p for trend: 0.012).

A positive association between Ca and death was observed when censoring for PCa [HR per SD: 1.14 (1.13-1.16)].  Conclusion:   The weak negative association between Ca and PCa risk is likely explained by the relation between Ca and death.

Src-suppressed C-kinase substrate (SSeCKS, the rodent orthologue of human Gravin/AKAP12), whose expression is downregulated by oncogenic Src and in many human cancers, antagonizes oncogenic Src pathways including those driving neovascularization at metastatic sites, metastatic cell motility and invasiveness. This is likely manifested through its function as a scaffolder of F-actin and signaling proteins such as cyclins, calmodulin, protein kinase C and A. Here we show that in contrast to its ability to inhibit haptotaxis, SSeCKS increased prostate cancer cell adhesion to fibronectin and type I collagen in a FAK-dependent manner, correlating with a relative increase in FAK(poY397) levels. In contrast, SSeCKS suppressed adhesion-induced Src activation (Src(poY416)) and phosphorylation of FAK at Y925, a known Src substrate site. SSeCKS also induced increased cell spreading, cell flattening, integrin Î²1 clustering and formation of mature focal adhesion plaques. An in silico analysis identified a Src-binding domain on SSeCKS(aa 153-166) that is homologous to the Src-binding domain of caveolin-1, and this region is required for SSeCKS-Src interaction, for SSeCKS-enhanced Src activity and sequestration to lipid rafts and for SSeCKS-enhanced adhesion of MAT-LyLu and CWR22Rv1 prostate cancer cells. Our data suggest a model in which SSeCKS suppresses oncogenic motility by sequestering Src to caveolin-rich lipid rafts, thereby disengaging Src from FAK-associated adhesion and signaling complexes.""","""['B Su', 'L Gao', 'F Meng', 'L-W Guo', 'J Rothschild', 'I H Gelman']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['SSeCKS/Gravin/AKAP12 inhibits cancer cell invasiveness and chemotaxis by suppressing a protein kinase C- Raf/MEK/ERK pathway.', 'Control of cytoskeletal architecture by the src-suppressed C kinase substrate, SSeCKS.', 'SSeCKS/Gravin/AKAP12 metastasis suppressor inhibits podosome formation via RhoA- and Cdc42-dependent pathways.', 'Suppression of tumor and metastasis progression through the scaffolding functions of SSeCKS/Gravin/AKAP12.', 'The role of SSeCKS/gravin/AKAP12 scaffolding proteins in the spaciotemporal control of signaling pathways in oncogenesis and development.', 'PTEN regulated PI3K-p110 and AKT isoform plasticity controls metastatic prostate cancer progression.', 'Dietary flavonoid myricetin inhibits invasion and migration of radioresistant lung cancer cells (A549-IR) by suppressing MMP-2 and MMP-9 expressions through inhibition of the FAK-ERK signaling pathway.', 'SSeCKS/Akap12 suppresses metastatic melanoma lung colonization by attenuating Src-mediated pre-metastatic niche crosstalk.', 'Small-Molecule Modulation of Lipid-Dependent Cellular Processes against Cancer: Fats on the Gunpoint.', 'EACR-MRS conference on Seed and Soil: In Vivo Models of Metastasis.']"""

The present study investigated a role for p21-activated kinase 4 (PAK4) in prostate cancer progression. PAK4 activation was markedly inhibited by H89, a specific protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor, and PAK4 was activated by the elevation of cAMP. The catalytic subunit of PKA interacted with the regulatory domain of PAK4, and directly phosphorylated PAK4 at serine 474 (S474). Catalytically active PAK4 enhanced the transcriptional activity of CREB independent of S133 phosphorylation. Stable knockdown of PAK4 in PC-3 and DU145 prostate cancer cells inhibited tumor formation in nude mice. Decreased tumorigenicity correlated with decreased expression of CREB and its targets, including Bcl-2 and cyclin A1. Additionally, in androgen-dependent LNCap-FGC cells, PAK4 regulated cAMP-induced neuroendocrine differentiation, which is known to promote tumor progression. Finally, PAK4 enhanced survival and decreased apoptosis following chemotherapy. These results suggested that PAK4 regulates progression toward hormone- and chemo-resistance in prostate cancer, and this study identified both a novel activation mechanism and potential downstream effector pathways.

Constitutively active androgen receptor splice variants (AR-Vs) lack the androgen receptor ligand-binding domain (AR-LBD), the intended target of androgen deprivation therapies including CRPC therapies such as abiraterone and MDV3100. While the canonical full-length androgen receptor (AR-FL) and AR-Vs are both increased in CRPCs, their expression regulation, associated transcriptional programs, and functional relationships have not been dissected. In this study, we show that suppression of ligand-mediated AR-FL signaling by targeting AR-LBD leads to increased AR-V expression in two cell line models of CRPCs. Importantly, treatment-induced AR-Vs activated a distinct expression signature enriched for cell-cycle genes without requiring the presence of AR-FL. Conversely, activation of AR-FL signaling suppressed the AR-Vs signature and activated expression programs mainly associated with macromolecular synthesis, metabolism, and differentiation. In prostate cancer cells and CRPC xenografts treated with MDV3100 or abiraterone, increased expression of two constitutively active AR-Vs, AR-V7 and ARV567ES, but not AR-FL, paralleled increased expression of the androgen receptor-driven cell-cycle gene UBE2C. Expression of AR-V7, but not AR-FL, was positively correlated with UBE2C in clinical CRPC specimens.

The tertiary prevention needs of rural-dwelling survivors can be even greater, yet little is known about rural and urban differences in lifestyle factors among this high-risk population.  Objectives:   To compare dietary patterns of urban and rural cancer survivors and to examine associations of dietary patterns with body mass index (BMI).  Design:   A secondary analysis was performed of baseline data from the Reach Out to Enhance Wellness (RENEW) trial, a diet and exercise intervention among overweight, long-term (â¥5 years), older survivors of colorectal, breast, and prostate cancer. Survivors in the present analysis (n=729) underwent two 45- to 60-minute telephone surveys, which included two 24-hour dietary recalls. Principal components analysis and multivariable general linear models were used to derive dietary patterns and to evaluate associations between dietary patterns and BMI, respectively.  Results:   Principal components analysis identified three primary dietary patterns among rural dwellers (high sweets and starches, high reduced-fat dairy, cereal, nuts, and fruits, and mixed) and three among urban dwellers (high fruits and vegetables, high meat and refined grains, and high sugar-sweetened beverages). Among rural survivors, greater adherence to the high reduced-fat dairy, cereal, nuts, and fruits pattern was positively associated with lower BMI (P trend <0.05), whereas higher scores on the mixed pattern was associated with greater BMI (P trend <0.05). Greater adherence to the high fruits and vegetables pattern among urban survivors was inversely associated with BMI (P trend <0.05).

Telephone surveys with 1,029 first-degree relatives (354 non-Latino Whites, 228 Latinos, 272 African Americans, 175 Asians) assessed prostate cancer screening behavior and correlates of screening.  Results:   Less than half of the participants had received a prostate specific antigen (PSA) test in the past year, with lowest rates observed among Latinos. Factors independently associated with an increased likelihood of the PSA test receipt in the total sample included: prior PSA testing, having a physician recommendation to be screened, and reporting fewer barriers to screening. Being the brother versus the son of the case predicted a higher likelihood of screening for all ethnic groups except for African Americans. In addition, the negative influence of barriers on screening was significantly greater for Latinos compared with Asians.

YM155 also inhibited tumor growth in vivo, reducing the size of pancreatic cancer cell line MIAPaCa-2 xenografts by 77.1% on day 31. Western blot analyses further showed that YM155 downregulated phosphoinoside 3-kinase (PI3K) expression and reduced the levels of phosphorylated (activated) extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) in PANC-1 cells. Interestingly, we also found that YM155 downregulated the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in various cancer cell lines and induced the EGFR phosphorylation and ubiquitination of EGFR in PANC-1 cells.

To this end, despite shared androgen-dependence and functional similarities to the prostate gland, seminal vesicle cancer is exceptionally rare.  Experimental design:   We conducted genomic pathway analyses comparing patient-matched normal prostate and seminal vesicle epithelial cells to identify novel pathways for tumor initiation and progression. Derived gene expression profiles were grouped into cancer biomodules using a protein-protein network algorithm to analyze their relationship to known oncogenes. Each resultant biomodule was assayed for its prognostic ability against publically available prostate cancer patient gene array datasets.  Results:   Analyses show that the embryonic developmental biomodule containing four homeobox gene family members (Meis1, Meis2, Pbx1, and HoxA9) detects a survival difference in a set of watchful-waiting patients (n = 172, P = 0.05), identify men who are more likely to recur biochemically postprostatectomy (n = 78, P = 0.02), correlate with Gleason score (r = 0.98, P = 0.02), and distinguish between normal prostate, primary tumor, and metastatic disease.

In 2010, ~217,730 new cases of prostate cancer were reported in the United States. Prompt diagnosis of the disease can substantially improve its clinical outcome. Improving capability for early detection, as well as developing new therapeutic targets in advanced disease are research priorities that will ultimately lead to better patient survival. Eukaryotic cells secrete proteins via distinct regulated mechanisms which are either ER/Golgi dependent or microvesicle mediated. The release of microvesicles has been shown to provide a novel mechanism for intercellular communication. Exosomes are nanometer sized cup-shaped membrane vesicles which are secreted from normal and cancerous cells. They are present in various biological fluids and are rich in characteristic proteins. Exosomes may thus have potential both in facilitating early diagnosis via less invasive procedures or be candidates for novel therapeutic approaches for castration resistance prostate cancer. Because exosomes have been shown previously to have a role in cell-cell communication in the local tumor microenvironment, conferring activation of numerous survival mechanisms, we characterized constitutive lipids, cholesterol and proteins from exosomes derived from six prostate cell lines and tracked their uptake in both cancerous and benign prostate cell lines respectively.

This study aimed to gather cancer patients' and clinicians' opinions and preferences about the best time, in the secondary care pathway, to approach patients about joining longitudinal observational PROMs-based (LO-PROMs) research.  Methods:   The sample comprised 15 patients with non-metastatic breast, colorectal or prostate cancer, and 15 clinicians including surgeons, oncologists and nurse specialists. Patients and clinicians participated in one face-to-face topic-guided audio-recorded interview. Data were analysed using thematic content analysis.  Results:   Patients did not want to be approached about LO-PROMs research early in the care pathway, near diagnosis and treatment planning or before any surgery and its results. Patients felt that LO-PROMs research is best introduced from the time people are 'settled' on (post-surgical) treatment regimens, provided they are coping well emotionally and not experiencing significant physical side effects; patients emphasised variability in people's experience of and response to cancer and treatment. Clinicians also advised against approach near diagnosis, although generally recommended initiating recruitment somewhat sooner than patients.  Conclusions:   Patients expressed strong homogeneous preferences and ideally wanted to be approached about LO-PROMs research when their initial fears and anxiety about cancer treatment and survival had diminished, and they felt some sense of certainty and optimism about the future. As the timeline of clinical events varies, maximising recruitment may mean approaching patients at varied time points post-diagnosis.

However, less is known about the role of mutations. Here we sequenced the exomes of 50 lethal, heavily pre-treated metastatic CRPCs obtained at rapid autopsy (including three different foci from the same patient) and 11 treatment-naive, high-grade localized prostate cancers. We identified low overall mutation rates even in heavily treated CRPCs (2.00 per megabase) and confirmed the monoclonal origin of lethal CRPC. Integrating exome copy number analysis identified disruptions of CHD1 that define a subtype of ETS gene family fusion-negative prostate cancer. Similarly, we demonstrate that ETS2, which is deleted in approximately one-third of CRPCs (commonly through TMPRSS2:ERG fusions), is also deregulated through mutation. Furthermore, we identified recurrent mutations in multiple chromatin- and histone-modifying genes, including MLL2 (mutated in 8.6% of prostate cancers), and demonstrate interaction of the MLL complex with the AR, which is required for AR-mediated signalling. We also identified novel recurrent mutations in the AR collaborating factor FOXA1, which is mutated in 5 of 147 (3.4%) prostate cancers (both untreated localized prostate cancer and CRPC), and showed that mutated FOXA1 represses androgen signalling and increases tumour growth. Proteins that physically interact with the AR, such as the ERG gene fusion product, FOXA1, MLL2, UTX (also known as KDM6A) and ASXL1 were found to be mutated in CRPC. In summary, we describe the mutational landscape of a heavily treated metastatic cancer, identify novel mechanisms of AR signalling deregulated in prostate cancer, and prioritize candidates for future study.""","""['Catherine S Grasso', 'Yi-Mi Wu', 'Dan R Robinson', 'Xuhong Cao', 'Saravana M Dhanasekaran', 'Amjad P Khan', 'Michael J Quist', 'Xiaojun Jing', 'Robert J Lonigro', 'J Chad Brenner', 'Irfan A Asangani', 'Bushra Ateeq', 'Sang Y Chun', 'Javed Siddiqui', 'Lee Sam', 'Matt Anstett', 'Rohit Mehra', 'John R Prensner', 'Nallasivam Palanisamy', 'Gregory A Ryslik', 'Fabio Vandin', 'Benjamin J Raphael', 'Lakshmi P Kunju', 'Daniel R Rhodes', 'Kenneth J Pienta', 'Arul M Chinnaiyan', 'Scott A Tomlins']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Nature""","""['Urological cancer: Genetic landscape studies of prostate cancer offer new clues.', 'Prostate cancer: Painting the genetic landscape of prostate cancer.', 'A picture with more details is painted for prostate cancer.', 'Mapping mutations in prostate cancer exomes.', 'Uncovering the genetic landscape driving castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Uncovering the genetic landscape driving castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Characterization of ERG, AR and PTEN gene status in circulating tumor cells from patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptor (AR) aberrations in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Exome sequencing identifies recurrent SPOP, FOXA1 and MED12 mutations in prostate cancer.', 'Pioneer of prostate cancer: past, present and the future of FOXA1.', 'Exploring the Onset and Progression of Prostate Cancer through a Multicellular Agent-based Model.', 'Histone methyltransferase KMT2D inhibits ENKTL carcinogenesis by epigenetically activating SGK1 and SOCS1.', 'Genetic alterations in MED12 promote castration-resistant prostate cancer through modulation of GLI3 signaling.', 'METTL1 promotes tumorigenesis through tRNA-derived fragment biogenesis in prostate cancer.', 'CDC20 Is Regulated by the Histone Methyltransferase, KMT5A, in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.']"""

Patients with bone metastases can experience complications known as skeletal-related events (SREs) which may cause significant debilitation and have a negative impact on quality of life and functional independence. The current recommended systemic treatment for the prevention of SREs is based on the use of bisphosphonates: ibandronate, pamidronate and zoledronic acid- the most potent one- are approved in advanced breast cancer with bone metastases, whereas only zoledronic acid is indicated in advanced prostate cancer with bone metastases. The 2011 ASCO guidelines on breast cancer, recommend initiating bisphosphonate treatment only for patients with evidence of bone destruction due to bone metastases. Denosumab, a fully human antibody that specifically targets the RANK-L, has been demonstrated in two phase III studies to be superior to zoledronic acid in preventing or delaying SREs in breast and prostate cancer and non-inferior in other solid tumours and mieloma; it's convenient subcutaneous administration and the fact that does not require dose adjustment in cases of renal impairment, make this agent an attractive new therapeutic option in patients with bone metastases.

Methods:   Patients with newly diagnosed, locally advanced, or metastatic adenocarcinoma of the prostate were enrolled in our study, after informed consent was obtained. All patients received bicalutamide 50 mg daily for 28 days, starting 7 days before the first injection of triptorelin. A dosage of 11.25 mg triptorelin was injected on Day 0 (baseline) and repeated on Day 90. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and testosterone concentrations were measured on Days 90 and 180.  Results:   A total of 41 patients were enrolled, with a median age of 78 (57-92) years, and a baseline median PSA of 122.69 ng/mL. One patient dropped out of the study, one was excluded in the fourth month due to a protocol violation, and one died 4 months after initiation of treatment as a result of disease progression. In total, 40 men were eligible for Day 90 and 38 men for Day 180 analysis. On Day 90, 97.5% of men had reached castration testosterone concentration â¤0.5 ng/mL, and all men had reached this concentration on Day 180.

Methods:   Daily prostate localization using cone beam CT or orthogonal kV imaging has been performed at UT Southwestern Medical Center since 2006. Prostate patients are implanted with gold seeds, which are matched with the planning CT or DRR before treatment. More recently, a technology using electromagnetic transponders implanted within the prostate was introduced into our clinic (CalypsoÂ®). With each technology, patients are localized initially using skin marks and the room lasers. In this study, patients were localized with Calypso and either CBCT or kV orthogonal images in the same treatment session, allowing a direct comparison of the technologies. Localization difference distributions were determined from the difference in the offsets determined by CBCT/kV imaging and Calypso. CBCT-Calypso and kV imaging-Calypso localization data were summarized from over 900 and 250 fractions each, respectively. The Wilcoxon signed rank test is used to determine if the localization differences are statistically significant. We also calculated Pearson's product-moment correlation coefficient (R2) to determine if there is a linear relationship between the shifts determined by Calypso and the radiographic techniques.  Results:   The differences between CBCT-Calypso and kV imaging-Calypso localizations are -0.18 Â± 2.90 mm, -0.79 Â± 2.18 mm, -0.01 Â± 1.20 mm and -0.09 Â± 1.40 mm, 0.48 Â± 1.50 mm, 0.08 Â± 1.04 mm, respectively, in the AP, SI, and RL directions. The Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients for the CBCT-Calypso shifts were 0.71, 0.92 and 0.88 and for the OBI-Calypso comparison were 0.95, 0.89 and 0.85. The percentage of localization differences that were less than 3 mm were 86.1%, 84.5% and 96.0% for the CBCT-Calypso comparison and 95.8%, 94.3% and 97% for the kV OBI-Calypso comparison. No trends were observed in the Bland-Altman analysis.  Conclusions:   Localization of the prostate using electromagnetic transponders agrees well with radiographic techniques and each technology is suitable for high precision radiotherapy.

Comparisons were made across groups differentiated by age in terms of the expected value of the prostate cancer screening.  Results:   Uptake of prostate screening in men 40 years and over in the preceding 12 months was approximately 24%. Uptake was higher among those in age groups that are perceived to receive most benefit from a Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) test based on the findings of the ERSPC trial. Screening is highest in those with highest socioeconomic status and educational attainment, and who also hold private insurance cover. The largest socioeconomic inequality is observed for men over 70 years of age (0.2298). The smallest inequality was observed for those aged 55-69 (0.1573). Decomposition of the concentration indices shows that possession of private insurance is the largest determinant of inequality among those aged 55-69 (36%) and remains a significant determinant for those aged 40-54 (26%) and those aged 70 and over (17%).  Conclusions:   There are high levels of prostate cancer screening uptake and significant income-related inequality in uptake in the Republic of Ireland. Given that the merits of prostate cancer screening overall and across different age groups are the subject of debate, the high levels of screening and income-related inequalities in uptake warrant closer attention and identification of potential policy responses.""","""['RichÃ©al Burns', 'Brendan Walsh', 'Linda Sharp', ""Ciaran O'Neill""]""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""J Health Serv Res Policy""","""['The role of private medical insurance in socio-economic inequalities in cancer screening uptake in Ireland.', 'An examination of variations in the uptake of prostate cancer screening within and between the countries of the EU-27.', 'Predictors of prostate cancer screening among health fair participants.', 'Detection of prostate cancer: the impact of the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC).', 'Landmarks in prostate cancer screening.', 'Effect of Perceived Self-Vulnerability on Prostate Cancer Screening Uptake and Associated Factors: A Cross-Sectional Study of Public Health Facilities in Western Kenya.', 'Prostate specific antigen test uptake: a cross sectional study on elderly men in Western Iran.', 'Factors associated with the use of health services by elderly men in Brazil: a cross-sectional study.', 'Challenges in generating costs and utilisation rates associated with castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Factors driving inequality in prostate cancer survival: a population based study.']"""

Two-dimensional protein electrophoresis, mass spectrometry, and immunodepletion assays identified one of the major active factors in the conditioned medium as Î±-type enolase (Î±-enolase, or ENO1). Moreover, in prostate stromal cells, estradiol not only enhanced the stability of ENO1 at the protein level in an estrogen receptor-Î±-dependent manner but also promoted its secretion to the extracellular matrix. Furthermore, recombinant ENO1 bound to the surface of PCa cells and promoted cell migration via their plasminogen receptor activity in a paracrine manner.

Patients and methods:   PCa survivors (n = 529), 5 to 10 years postdiagnosis, were frequency-matched to noncancer controls (n = 514) for race, screening center, year of enrollment, and trial arm. Participants completed a telephone interview regarding PCa-specific symptomatology. Weights accounted for patient selection from the five PLCO screening centers. Propensity-score methods were used to balance groups of interest with respect to demographic and medical characteristics.  Results:   Weighted linear regression analyses revealed poorer sexual and urinary function among PCa survivors compared with noncancer controls (P < .001). Trial arm was not significantly related to any outcome (P > .31). Compared with radical prostatectomy patients (n = 201), radiation-therapy patients (n = 110) reported better sexual (P < .05) and urinary (P < .001) functioning but poorer bowel outcomes (P < .05). Survivors who received treatment combinations including androgen deprivation (n = 207) reported significantly poorer hormone-related symptoms compared with radical prostatectomy patients (P < .05). CONCLUSION This study demonstrated the persistence of clinically significant, long-term PCa treatment-related sexual and urinary adverse effects up to 10 years postdiagnosis. To our knowledge, this was the first comparison of prostate-related dysfunction among screened survivors versus screened noncancer controls and indicated that these long-term problems were attributable to PCa treatment and not to aging or comorbidities.

The strongest linkage peak of prostate cancer overlies a variable region of ~750 kb at Xq27 enriched by segmental duplications (SDs), suggesting that the predisposition to prostate cancer may be a genomic disorder caused by recombinational interaction between SDs. The large size of SDs and their sequence similarity make it difficult to examine this region for possible rearrangements using standard methods. To overcome this problem, direct isolation of a set of genomic segments by in vivo recombination in yeast (a TAR cloning technique) was used to perform a mutational analysis of the 750 kb region in X-linked families. We did not detect disease-specific rearrangements within this region. In addition, transcriptome and computational analyses were performed to search for nonannotated genes within the Xq27 region, which may be associated with genetic predisposition to prostate cancer. Two candidate genes were identified, one of which is a novel gene termed SPANXL that represents a highly diverged member of the SPANX gene family, and the previously described CDR1 gene that is expressed at a high level in both normal and malignant prostate cells, and mapped 210 kb of upstream the SPANX gene cluster. No disease-specific alterations were identified in these genes. Our results exclude the 750-kb genetically unstable region at Xq27 as a candidate locus for prostate malignancy.

We analyzed the therapeutic efficacy of triptorelin pamoate (TP) as salvage treatment due to its higher potency than endogenous luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH). The amino acid sequence of TP is identical to that of endogenous LHRH except for position 6 where L-glycine is replaced by D-tryptophane rendering the synthetic moiety less susceptible to cleavage by proteolytic enzymes.  Patients and methods:   In this study 36 patients with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression following first line complete androgen blockade and antiandrogen (ADT) withdrawal were retrospectively analyzed. All patients demonstrated no or minimal metastatic disease. The PSA levels, PSA doubling time (PSADT), PSA velocity (PSAV) and testosterone serum concentrations were correlated with the therapeutic response. All patients received TP at a dose of 11.5 mg at 3-month intervals until documented progression.  Results:   The mean patient age was 69.2 years (range 52-79 years), the mean PSA level was 23.4 ng/ml (8.7-53.1 ng/ml) and the mean PSADT was 9.2 months (2.9-15.4 months). Mean testosterone serum concentration was 38.67 ng/dl (21-76 ng/dl), the mean time between start of ADT and progression was 42.4 months (13-76 months) and the median time was 46.8 months (16-82 months). A PSA decrease of â¥50% was reached in 9 out of 36 (25%) patients, 3 out of 36 (13.9%) patients each demonstrated stable PSA levels and a prolongation of PSADT from 6.2 to 9.8 months. Mean progression-free survival (PFS) was 21.4 weeks (7-53 weeks). PSA-responders exhibited a PFS of 53.2 weeks (26-64 weeks) as compared to 28 weeks (17-35 weeks) in nonresponders. PSA responders demonstrated significantly higher testosterone serum concentrations of 48.3 ng/dl (29-76 ng/dl) as compared to nonresponders with 32.6 ng/dl (21-62 ng/dl, p=0.02). Mean follow-up was 31.4 months (27-39 months), overall survival was 80.5% and cancer-specific survival was 88.9%.  Conclusion:   Changing the LHRH analogue in castration-refractory prostate cancer (CRPC) with testosterone serum concentrations at or above the castration level results in a temporary PSA response. This treatment option might be included in the therapeutic algorithm of CRPC. Although the PFS is short it allows the continuation of a treatment option with minimal side effects in a mere palliative situation. The data underline the need for continuous monitoring of testosterone during treatment with LHRH analogues.""","""['A Heidenreich', 'D Porres', 'R Epplen', 'T van Erps', 'D Pfister']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Urologe A""","""['EAU guidelines on prostate cancer.

There also appears to be a quality of life benefit during off-treatment intervals owing to the recovery of serum testosterone levels.  Methods:   In this multicentre European prospective randomised phase III trial EC507, testosterone serum concentrations were analysed in prostate cancer patients with PSA progression after radical prostatectomy. Patients were randomised to a continuous androgen deprivation (CAD) and IAD therapy using a 3-month depot with 11.25 mg leuprorelin acetate as microcapsule formulation. A complete IAD cycle comprises both a 6-month androgen deprivation therapy plus the off-treatment time (OTT).  Results:   Serum testosterone recovery was recorded in 109 patients during OTT in the IAD group. Testosterone recovery to baseline values was achieved in 79.3% during the first and in 64.9% during the second IAD cycle, respectively. Median time to testosterone normalisation was 100 days in the first and 115 days in the second cycle, respectively. No significant difference was observed up to 1000 days between IAD and CAD with regard to time to androgen-independent progression. This is the first prospective study of leuprorelin acetate 11.25mg demonstrating normalisation of testosterone levels in the off-treatment period in patients undergoing IAD.

This activity profile of SENP1 prompted us to investigate whether SENP1 is involved in the pathogenesis of prostate cancer. In previous studies, we have detected the overexpression of SENP1 in both precancerous prostate intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) lesions and prostate cancer tissue samples from patients. Whereas our whole-animal model has demonstrated that SENP1 induction is critical for prostate cell transformation, the role of SENP1 in prostate cancer progression is still unknown. In this study, we show that SENP1 expression directly correlates with prostate cancer aggressiveness and reccurrence, by analyzing more than 150 prostate cancer specimens. Modulating SENP1 level dictates colony formation of prostate cancer cell lines, tumor growth in nude mice and also prostate cancer cell migration and invasion. Silencing SENP1 level in highly metastatic prostate cancer cells perturbs their ability to metastasize to the bone and initiates secondary tumors. Mechanistically, the expression of two critical bone remodeling proteins, matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2) and MMP9, is regulated by SENP1 through the HIF1Î± signaling pathway.

Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis has provided product band at 774 bp, specific to SMVT. The mechanism and intracellular regulation of [3H]-biotin is also studied. [3H]-biotin uptake is found to be time and concentration dependent with K(m) and V(max) values of 19Â±2 Î¼M and 23Â±1 pmol/min/mg protein, respectively. The uptake process is saturable in micromolar concentration range but linear in nanomolar concentration range. [3H]-biotin uptake shows significant sodium, temperature, pH and energy dependency. The process is strongly inhibited by unlabeled biotin and structural analogs such as desthiobiotin, pantothenate, lipoate and valeric acid. Intracellular regulatory pathways such as Ca(2+)/calmodulin and PKC pathway but not PTK pathway appears to play an important role in modulating [3H]-biotin uptake.

Methods:   The cancer cell lines, including the LS174T G12D mutant (GGT to GAT) and the COLO320 wild-type, were tested to determine the limitation of detection and reproducibility of the PS method. In addition, 101 PCa patient samples, 13 benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and 12 normal adjacent tissue samples, were assayed by PS and SS to evaluate their detection abilities for K-Ras mutations in codons 12 and 13.  Results:   The PS assay was able to reproducibly detect 5% mutant alleles and had an intra-assay variability of 4.21% and inter-assay variability of 11.37%. The PS assay detected a higher number of K-Ras mutations in PCa samples than the SS assay (8.91% vs. 3.96%). Correlation and stratification analyses of the PCa samples and K-Ras mutation status revealed no associations between age, serum prostate specific antigen (PSA), depth of invasion (pT category), or Gleason score.  Conclusions:   We demonstrated that the PS method detected more K-Ras mutations in codons 12 and 13 of FFPE prostate cancer samples from Chinese patients than the traditional SS method.

We examined CT postplans of four experienced brachytherapists for comparison with MR-determined prostate volumes.  Methods and materials:   Seventy-five patients had CT and MR scans 1 month post-(125)I prostate brachytherapy. CT scans were contoured by the treating physician and dosimetry calculated. The prostate was contoured independently on MR by one observer with extensive MR experience, the scans were fused and dosimetric parameters compared.  Results:   The mean prostate volume on CT was 38.3 cc (17.5-78.6 cc), on MR 33.3 cc (16.3-66.1 cc). On average, the volume on CT was 16.1% larger than on MR (range, 8% smaller to 64% larger). Craniocaudal discordance of the CT vs. MR prostate contours ranged from 4 mm cranial to 10 mm caudal to MR base and from 6 mm cranial to 14 mm caudal to MR apex. The CT prostate volume not only included an average of 90% of the MR prostate (range, 75-99%) but also included normal tissue (mean, 8.3 cc; range, 2.9-17.1 cc). The average difference between the calculated D(90) from CT contours vs. MR contours was 10.0 Gy (standard deviation, 8.8; range, -37.6 to +41.6 Gy).  Conclusions:   On average, only 90% of the MR-defined prostate is included in CT contours, while a volume of normal tissue is erroneously designated as prostate.

The present study investigated the association of androgen receptor (AR), prostate-specific antigen (PSA or KLK3), and cytochrome P450 (CYP19) gene polymorphisms in CaP (n=105) and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) (n=120) in comparison to normal healthy controls (n=106) in an Indian population. We also evaluated the functional consequences of these gene variants on AR and PSA mRNA expression. Significant association of short AR CAG repeats (â¤24) with risk of CaP (odds ratios [OR]=2.98, p<0.001) and BPH (OR=1.96, p=0.01) was observed; however, CYP19 gene polymorphism was not found to be associated with disease phenotype (p>0.05).

PSA G-158A genotype independently increased the risk of developing BPH (OR=16.37, p<0.001), irrespective of AR CAG repeat length. Using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, we found a significant upregulation of AR and PSA mRNA expression in CaP comparison to BPH. While short AR CAG (â¤24) repeats were associated with higher AR mRNA expression in CaP (p=0.002), the PSA SNP did not correlate with its mRNA expression. Interestingly, significantly higher risk estimates for CaP were observed for the combined analysis of short AR CAG and CYP19 genotypes (A2A2) (OR=7.18, p<0.001) or A2A3 (OR=7.60, p=0.004).

Clinical data of patients with multiple sclerosis residing in British Columbia, Canada who visited a British Columbia multiple sclerosis clinic from 1980 to 2004 were linked to provincial cancer registry, vital statistics and health registration data.

For example, in prostate cancer, models predicting disease-specific survival use serum prostate-specific antigen levels. These models typically show that higher marker levels are associated with poorer prognosis. Consequently, they are often interpreted as indicating that detecting disease at a lower threshold of the biomarker is likely to generate a survival benefit. However, lowering the threshold of the biomarker is tantamount to early detection. For survival benefit to not be simply an artifact of starting the survival clock earlier, we must account for the lead time of early detection. It is not known whether the existing prognostic models imply a survival benefit under early detection once lead time has been accounted for. In this article, we investigate survival benefit implied by prognostic models where the predictor(s) of disease-specific survival are age and/or biomarker level at disease detection. We show that the benefit depends on the rate of biomarker change, the lead time, and the biomarker level at the original date of diagnosis as well as on the parameters of the prognostic model. Even if the prognostic model indicates that lowering the threshold of the biomarker is associated with longer disease-specific survival, this does not necessarily imply that early detection will confer an extension of life expectancy.""","""['L Y T Inoue', 'R Gulati', 'C Yu', 'M W Kattan', 'R Etzioni']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Biostatistics""","""['Wisteria floribunda Agglutinin and Its Reactive-Glycan-Carrying Prostate-Specific Antigen as a Novel Diagnostic and Prognostic Marker of Prostate Cancer.', 'Two-Stage Biomarker Protocols for Improving the Precision of Early Detection of Prostate Cancer.', '-2proenzyme prostate specific antigen for prostate cancer detection: a national cancer institute early detection research network validation study.', 'Mass screening for detection of prostatic carcinoma.', 'PSA--Quo vadis?.', 'Genetic variants in RNA m5 C modification genes associated with survival and chemotherapy efficacy of colorectal cancer.', 'Identification of LEA, a podocalyxin-like glycoprotein, as a predictor for the progression of colorectal cancer.', 'Comparative Analysis of Biopsy Upgrading in Four Prostate Cancer Active Surveillance Cohorts.']"""

Because of our relatively poorer understanding of this part of the genome, the functional consequences of trait-associated variants pose a considerable challenge. To identify the genes through which risk loci act, we hypothesized that the risk variants are regulatory elements. For each of 12 known risk polymorphisms, we evaluated the correlation between risk allele status and transcript abundance for all annotated protein-coding transcripts within a 1-Mb interval. A total of 103 transcripts were evaluated in 662 prostate tissue samples [normal (n = 407) and tumor (n = 255)] from 483 individuals [European Americans (n = 233), Japanese (n = 127), and African Americans (n = 123)].

Although associations were also observed in tumor tissue, they tended to be more attenuated. Previously, we showed that MSMB and NCOA4 participate in prostate cancer pathogenesis.

Materials and methods:   This study included a total of 159 consecutive patients agedâ¥75 years with mCRPC who were treated with docetaxel-based chemotherapy. The efficacy and tolerability of this therapy were retrospectively analyzed.  Results:   In these 159 patients, the median age and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level before docetaxel-based chemotherapy were 78 years and 44.0 ng/ml, respectively.

After prostate cancer, benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostatitis may induce PSA increase. PSA reduction, after medical therapy, might identify those patients in whom biopsy can be avoided. The aim of this study was to determine if antibiotic and anti-inflammatory allow avoiding prostate biopsies in patients showing PSA decrease or normalization after medical therapy.  Materials and methods:   Between January 2009 and May 2011, a total of 31 men with total PSA between 4 and 10 ng/ml were enrolled in this study. Patients with pathological digital rectal examination and clinical symptoms of prostatitis or lower urinary tract infection were excluded from the study. Total PSA, free PSA and free/total PSA were evaluated for all of them. Patients received 1000 mg ciprofloxacin daily for 15 days in combination with 100 mg ketoprofen administered rectally. PSA determinations were repeated two weeks after treatment. SPSS for Windows (version 10.0.7) computer package was used for statistical analysis of the data; a p value <0.05 was considered as level of statistical significance.  Results:   19 patients (61%) showed a reduction of PSA level after therapy. Initial total PSA and free-PSA levels were 7.41 and 1.24 ng/ml, respectively. After medical therapy total and free PSA decreased to 5.72 and 1.19 ng/ml. Free/total PSA changed from 15.2% to 14.3%. PSA reached a normal range value in 5 patients (16%), while in 26 patients it was persistently >4 ng/ml, it decreased in 14 patients (45%), and increased in 12 (39%). Patients with PSA up to 4 ng/ml reported a prostatic cancer in 28.5% and 41.6% of cases if PSA was respectively decreased or increased from the initial value.

We evaluated the effect of intramuscular vaccination without or with electroporation (EP) on vaccine potency. Thirty-two HLA-A2(+) patients were vaccinated and monitored for immune and clinical responses for a follow-up period of 72 weeks.

Thirty-two HLA-A2(-) control patients were assessed for time to next treatment and overall survival. Vaccination was safe and well tolerated. The vaccine induced DOM-specific CD4(+) and PSMA(27)-specific CD8(+) T cells, which were detectable at significant levels above baseline at the end of the study (p = 0.0223 and p = 0.00248, respectively).

Objectives:   The purpose of this study was to determine the long-term effects of prostate cancer treatment on partners' appraisal of their caregiving experience, marital satisfaction, sexual satisfaction, and quality of life (QOL) and factors related to these variables.  Methods:   This exploratory study evaluated QOL among spouses of prostate cancer survivors at 24 months after treatment. Partners completed a battery of self-report questionnaires in a computer-assisted telephone interview.  Results:   The sample consisted of 121 partners with average age of 60 years. There was a significant relationship between partners' perceptions of bother about the man's treatment outcomes and negative appraisal of their caregiving experience and poorer QOL. Younger partners who had a more negative appraisal of caregiving also had significantly worse QOL.  Conclusions:   Men's treatment outcomes continued to bother the partner and resulted in more negative appraisal and lower QOL 2 years after initial prostate cancer treatment. Younger partners may be at greater risk of poorer QOL outcomes especially if they have a more negative view of their caregiving experience.  Implications for practice:   Findings support prior research indicating that prostate cancer affects not only the person diagnosed with the disease but also his partner. Partners may benefit from tailored interventions designed to decrease negative appraisal and improve symptom management and QOL during the survivorship period.""","""['Janet K Harden', 'Martin G Sanda', 'John T Wei', 'Hossein Yarandi', 'Larry Hembroff', 'Jill Hardy', 'Laurel L Northouse;PROSTQA Consortium Study Group']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Cancer Nurs""","""[""Survivorship after prostate cancer treatment: spouses' quality of life at 36 months."", 'Quality of life in partners of patients with localised prostate cancer.', 'The influence of developmental life stage on quality of life in survivors of prostate cancer and their partners.', 'Predictors of Patient and Partner Satisfaction Following Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Psychosocial interventions to support partners of men with prostate cancer: a systematic and critical review of the literature.', 'Mindfulness-based stress reduction for men on active surveillance for prostate cancer and their spouses: Design and methodology of a randomized controlled trial.', 'A pilot feasibility study of Exercising TogetherÂ© during radiation therapy for prostate cancer: a dyadic approach for patients and spouses.', 'Beyond pain, distress, and disability: the importance of social outcomes in pain management research and practice.', 'Treating the patient and not just the cancer: therapeutic burden in prostate cancer.', ""The Ecology of Patients' Sexual Health Adjustment After Prostate Cancer Treatment: The Influence of the Social and Healthcare Environment.""]"""

Methods:   In this prospective study, 73 patients (31 patients with multiple myeloma or myeloma precursor disease and 42 with prostate cancer) were injected with a mean administered dose of 141 MBq of (18)F-NaF. Sixty patients underwent 3 sequential sessions of 3-dimensional PET/CT of the torso beginning approximately 15 min after (18)F-NaF injection, followed by whole-body 3-dimensional PET/CT at 2 h. The remaining 13 prostate cancer patients were imaged only at 2 and 3 h after injection. Twenty-one prostate cancer patients underwent repeated baseline studies (mean interval, 5.9 d) to evaluate reproducibility.  Results:   The measured effective dose was 0.017 mSv/MBq, with the urinary bladder, osteogenic cells, and red marrow receiving the highest doses at 0.080, 0.077, and 0.028 mGy/MBq, respectively. Visual analysis showed that uptake in both normal and abnormal bone increased with time; however, the rate of increase decreased with time. A semiautomated workflow provided objective uptake parameters, including the mean standardized uptake value of all pixels within bone with SUVs greater than 10 and the average of the mean SUV of all malignant lesions identified by the algorithm. The values of these parameters for the images beginning at approximately 15 min and approximately 35 min were significantly different (0.3% change per minute). Differences between the later imaging time points were not significant (P < 0.01). Repeated baseline studies showed high intraclass correlations (>0.9) and relatively low critical percentage change (the value above which a change can be considered real) for these parameters. The tumor-to-normal bone ratio, based on the maximum SUV of identified malignant lesions, decreased with time; however, this difference was small, estimated at approximately 0.16%/min in the first hour.  Conclusion:   (18)F-NaF PET/CT images obtained with modest radiation exposures can result in highly reproducible imaging parameters. Although the tumor-to-normal bone ratio decreases slightly with time, the high temporal dependence during uptake periods less than 30 min may limit accurate quantitation.

Here we show that S100A8 and to a lesser extent S100A9 mRNA expression is induced by prostaglandin E2 in a dose and time-dependent manner in PC-3 prostate cancer cells as well as in BPH-1 benign prostatic epithelial cells. Prostanoid receptor EP2 antagonist AH6809 and EP4 antagonist AH23848, as well as protein kinase A inhibitor H89, inhibited prostaglandin E2 mediated increase in S100A8 mRNA expression as well as promoter activity. Sequence analysis detected a potential binding site of the transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer-binding-protein-beta within the proximal S100A8 promoter. CCAAT/enhancer-binding-protein-beta overexpression increased S100A8 mRNA and protein expression as well as its promoter activity. The latter was prevented by mutation of the potential CCAAT/enhancer-binding-protein-beta binding site within the S100A8 promoter. Chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed increased binding of CCAAT/enhancer-binding-protein-beta to the S100A8 promoter in prostaglandin E2 treated cells. Knockdown of CCAAT/enhancer-binding-protein-beta by siRNA blocked prostaglandin E2 mediated induction of S100A8 promoter activity and mRNA expression. Our results indicate that in prostate cancer cells, S100A8 expression is stimulated by prostaglandin E2 via EP2 and EP4 receptors through activation of the protein kinase A signaling pathway and subsequent stimulation of CCAAT/enhancer-binding-protein-beta binding to the S100A8 promoter.""","""['Lin Miao', 'Sina Grebhardt', 'Jiandang Shi', 'Isabelle Peipe', 'Ju Zhang', 'Doris Mayer']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Int J Biochem Cell Biol""","""['Hypoxia and HIF-1 increase S100A8 and S100A9 expression in prostate cancer.', 'A nonclassic CCAAT enhancer element binding protein binding site contributes to alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase expression in prostate cancer.', 'Malignant breast epithelial cells stimulate aromatase expression via promoter II in human adipose fibroblasts: an epithelial-stromal interaction in breast tumors mediated by CCAAT/enhancer binding protein beta.', 'Prostaglandin E2 induces stromal cell-derived factor-1 expression in prostate stromal cells by activating protein kinase A and transcription factor Sp1.', 'Human papillomavirus E5 protein induces expression of the EP4 subtype of prostaglandin E2 receptor in cyclic AMP response element-dependent pathways in cervical cancer cells.', 'Prostaglandins and calprotectin are genetically and functionally linked to the Inflammatory Bowel Diseases.', 'Chronic Inflammatory Microenvironment in Epidermodysplasia Verruciformis Skin Lesions: Role of the Synergism Between HPV8 E2 and C/EBPÎ² to Induce Pro-Inflammatory S100A8/A9 Proteins.', 'Can Wound Exudate from Venous Leg Ulcers Measure Wound Pain Status?: A Pilot Study.', 'Expression of prostaglandin E2 prostanoid receptor EP2 and interleukin-1Î² in laryngeal carcinoma - preliminary study.', 'S100 proteins in cancer.']"""

The aims of this paper are to verify whether wash-in-rate parameter (speed of contrast uptake in dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance) can help to differentiate prostate cancer from non-neoplastic T2-weighted hypointense lesions within prostate gland and to assess a cut-off for prostate cancer diagnosis.  Methods:   Prospective, monocentric, multi-departmental study. Thirty consecutive patients underwent T2-weighted and dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance, and re-biopsy. T2-weighted hypointense lesions, >5mm in size, were noted. Lesions were assessed as cancerous (showing mass effect, or no defined margin within transitional zone) and non cancerous (no mass effect) and were compared with histopathology by 2Ã2 tables. Wash-in-rate of each lesion was calculated and was correlated with histopathology. Student's t-test was adopted to assess significant differences. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was employed to identify the best cut-off for wash-in-rate in detecting prostate cancer.  Results:   At re-biopsy, cancer was proven in 43% of patients. On T2-weighted MRI, 111 hypointense lesions â¥5 mm in size were found. Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of T2-weighted MRI were 80% (Â±12.4 CI 95%), 74.6% (Â±10.1 CI 95%), and 76.5% (Â±7.9 CI 95%), respectively. Mean WR was 5.8Â±1.9/s for PCa zones and 2.96Â±1.44/s for non-PCa zones (p<0.00000001). At ROC analysis, the best area under curve (AUC) for wash-in-rate parameter was associated to 4.2/s threshold with 82.5% sensitivity (CIÂ±7.07), 97.2% specificity (CIÂ±4.99) and 91.2% accuracy (CIÂ±5.27). Eighteen false positive lesions on T2-weighted MRI showed low wash-in-rate values suggesting non-cancer lesions, while in 5/8 false negative cases high wash-in-rate values correctly suggested prostate cancer. Nine lesions with surgically proven cancer were not included in the saturation biopsy scheme, in 2/9 cases the only site of cancer.

However, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides greater anatomic detail than TRUS. We compared treatment plans generated using TRUS, endorectal coil MRI (erMRI), and standard body array coil MRI (sMRI).  Methods and materials:   Treatment plans were used from patients treated with permanent, stranded-seed (125)I brachytherapy in a prospective trial. All men underwent pretreatment planning based on TRUS, and all underwent erMRI before treatment and sMRI 30 days after the implant. Treatments for 20 consecutive patients were replanned on sMRI and erMRI images by investigators blinded to TRUS-based plans. Prostate volume/dimensions, radioactivity-to-prostate-volume ratio, and dosimetric parameters were compared.  Results:   Compared with TRUS, mean prostate volume measured by erMRI was smaller, medial-lateral diameter was larger, and anterior-posterior diameter was smaller, suggesting that the endorectal coil produced anatomic distortions. Craniocaudal prostate length was smaller on both types of MRI than on TRUS, suggesting that TRUS overestimates prostate length. Activity per volume was 7.5% lower for plans based on sMRI than on TRUS (0.901 vs. 0.974mCi/cm(3), p<0.001). sMRI plans had similar coverage of the planning target volume (PTV) (dose to 90% of the prostate [D(90)] 116.6% sMRI vs. 117.5% TRUS, p=0.526) and improved dose homogeneity (percentage of PTV receiving 150% of the prescription dose [V(150)] 47.4% sMRI vs. 53.8% TRUS, p=0.001 and percentage of PTV receiving 200% of the prescription dose [V(200)] 16.6% sMRI vs. 19.2% TRUS, p<0.001).  Conclusions:   Staging erMRI should not be routinely used for treatment planning because it produces anatomic distortion. sMRI may have treatment planning advantages over TRUS because of superior soft-tissue delineation of the prostate and adjacent normal tissue structures.""","""['Jeffrey M Albert', 'David A Swanson', 'Thomas J Pugh', 'Michael Zhang', 'Teresa L Bruno', 'Rajat J Kudchadker', 'Steven J Frank']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Brachytherapy""","""['Ultrasound-CT fusion compared with MR-CT fusion for postimplant dosimetry in permanent prostate brachytherapy.', 'Comparison of multiparametric MRI-based and transrectal ultrasound-based preplans with intraoperative ultrasound-based planning for low dose rate interstitial prostate seed implantation.', 'Dosimetric evaluation of MRI-to-ultrasound automated image registration algorithms for prostate brachytherapy.', 'Clinical evaluation of an MRI-to-ultrasound deformable image registration algorithm for prostate brachytherapy.', 'Use of three-dimensional radiation therapy planning tools and intraoperative ultrasound to evaluate high dose rate prostate brachytherapy implants.', 'Being certain about uncertainties: a robust evaluation method for high-dose-rate prostate brachytherapy treatment plans including the combination of uncertainties.', 'Dosimetric outcomes of preoperative treatment planning with intraoperative optimization using stranded seeds in prostate brachytherapy.', 'The current role of prostate multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging.', 'The association between the outcomes of extraperitoneal laparoscopic radical prostatectomy and the anthropometric measurements of the prostate by magnetic resonance imaging.', 'Permanent prostate brachytherapy pubic arch evaluation with diagnostic magnetic resonance imaging.']"""

MRI has demonstrated greater interobserver consistency in prostate contouring compared with CT. Although a valuable tool in postimplant assessment, MRI is costly and not always available. Our purpose is to compare dosimetry obtained using fusion of postimplant CT with preimplant transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) vs. CT-MR fusion.  Methods and materials:   Twenty patients receiving permanent (125)I seed prostate brachytherapy underwent preimplant TRUS with urethrography, 1-month CT with a Foley catheter, and 1-month MRI. No patient received androgen deprivation therapy or external beam radiotherapy. The prescription dose of (125)I implant monotherapy was 144Gy. The preimplant TRUS and postimplant CT images were fused based on urethral position, and the CT-TRUS images were subsequently fused to the MRI using a seed-to-seed match. Dosimetric parameters for the ultrasound- and MR-derived prostate were compared.  Results:   The mean absolute difference between dosimetry from MRI or CT-TRUS fusion for D(90) was 3.2% and in V(100) was 1.2%. Only 1 patient had a difference in MR- and ultrasound-derived D(90) of more than 10% (11.4%) and only 1 had a difference in V(100) of more than 5%.

The aim of this analysis was to describe additional relevant aspects of late side effects after prostate cancer radiotherapy.  Materials and methods:   All 178 primary prostate-cancer patients were treated within the Austrian-German multicenter trial by three-dimensional radiotherapy up to a local dose of 70 Gy (low/intermediate-risk) or 74 Gy (high-risk), respectively. Late gastrointestinal/urogenital (GI/GU) side-effects were prospectively assessed by the use of EORTC/RTOG score. Maximum side-effects, actuarial incidence rate and prevalence rates, initial appearance and duration of â¥grade 2 toxicity were evaluated.  Results:   Median follow-up was 74 months. Late GI/GU side-effects â¥grade 2 were detected in 15% (27/178) and 22% (40/178). The corresponding 5-year actuarial incidence rates for GI/GU side-effects were 19% and 23%, whereas the prevalence was 1-2% and 2-7% after 5 years, respectively. Late side effects â¥grade 2 appeared within 5 years after radiotherapy in all patients with GI side-effects (27/27) and in 85% (34/40) of the patients with GU side-effects, respectively and lasted for less than 3 years in 90% (GI) and 98% (GU).  Conclusions:   This study demonstrates that the majority of late GI and GU side effects after primary external beam radiotherapy for prostate cancer are transient. Using only actuarial incidence rates for reporting side effects may lead to misinterpretation or overestimation. The combination of incidence and prevalence rates provides a more comprehensive view on the complex issue of late side effects.""","""['Maximilian P Schmid', 'Richard PÃ¶tter', 'Valentin Bombosch', 'Samir Sljivic', 'Christian Kirisits', 'Wolfgang DÃ¶rr', 'Gregor Goldner']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Radiother Oncol""","""['Late toxicity after intensity-modulated radiation therapy for localized prostate cancer: an exploration of dose-volume histogram parameters to limit genitourinary and gastrointestinal toxicity.', 'Acute and late complications after radiotherapy for prostate cancer: results of a multicenter randomized trial comparing 68 Gy to 78 Gy.', 'Role of principal component analysis in predicting toxicity in prostate cancer patients treated with hypofractionated intensity-modulated radiation therapy.', 'Late toxicity rates following definitive radiotherapy for prostate cancer.', 'Systematic review of the effect of radiation dose on tumor control and morbidity in the treatment of prostate cancer by 3D-CRT.', 'Risk and prognosis of second corpus uteri cancer after radiation therapy for pelvic cancer: A population-based analysis.', 'Hospital readmissions for patients with prostate cancer are higher after radiotherapy than after prostatectomy.', 'Impact of Hypofractionated Radiotherapy on Patient-reported Outcomes in Prostate Cancer: Results up to 5\xa0yr in the CHHiP trial (CRUK/06/016).', 'Patient reported toxicity and quality of life after hypofractionated high-dose intensity-modulated radiotherapy for intermediate- and high risk prostate cancer.', 'Protective Effects of Biscoclaurine Alkaloids on Leukopenia Induced by 60Co-Î³ Radiation.']"""

AND WHAT DOES THE STUDY ADD?: Urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction are the most bothersome sequelae affecting health-related quality of life in patients treated with radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer. While it has been widely reported that a nerve-sparing approach significantly improves postoperative erectile function, the impact of neurovascular bundle preservation on urinary continence recovery is still a matter of controversy. Our study clearly demonstrates that patients treated with nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy have higher chances of recovering full continence after surgery. The results indicate that, when technically and oncologically feasible, an attempt at a nerve-sparing approach should be planned in order to increase the probability of achieving full continence after radical prostatectomy.  Objective:   To demonstrate that nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy (NSRP) is associated with higher rates of urinary continence (UC) recovery compared with non-nerve-sparing procedures in patients with surgically treated organ-confined prostate cancer.  Patients and methods:   The study included 1249 patients treated with radical prostatectomy between 2003 and 2010. Patients were divided into three preoperative risk groups: low (PSA < 10 ng/mL, cT1, biopsy Gleason sum â¤ 6), high (cT3 or biopsy Gleason 8-10 or PSA > 20 ng/mL) and intermediate (all the remaining). Postoperative UC recovery was defined as the absence of any protection device. The association between nerve-sparing status and UC recovery was assessed in univariable and multivariable Cox regression analyses after accounting for age at surgery, Charlson Comorbidity Index and preoperative risk group.  Results:   At a mean follow-up of 42.2 months (range 1-78), 993 patients (79.5%) recovered UC. Overall, UC recovery rate at 1 and 2 years was 76% and 79%, respectively. On univariable Cox regression analysis, age at surgery, preoperative risk group, medical comorbidities and nerve-sparing status were significantly associated with UC recovery (all P â¤ 0.001). On multivariable analysis, age, risk group and nerve-sparing status were also independently associated with UC recovery (all P < 0.003). Patients treated with bilateral NSRP had a 1.8-fold higher chance of full UC recovery.  Conclusions:   Patients treated with bilateral NSRP have significantly higher chances of recovering full continence. Therefore, when oncologically and technically feasible, a nerve-sparing procedure should be attempted.""","""['Nazareno Suardi', 'Marco Moschini', 'Andrea Gallina', 'Giorgio Gandaglia', 'Firas Abdollah', 'Umberto Capitanio', 'Marco Bianchi', 'Manuela Tutolo', 'NiccolÃ² Passoni', 'Andrea Salonia', 'Petter Hedlund', 'Patrizio Rigatti', 'Francesco Montorsi', 'Alberto Briganti']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Preoperative erectile function represents a significant predictor of postoperative urinary continence recovery in patients treated with bilateral nerve sparing radical prostatectomy.', 'Prediction of functional outcomes after nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy: results of conditional survival analyses.', 'Impact of nerve sparing technique on patient self-assessed outcomes after radical perineal prostatectomy.', 'Preservation of the neurovascular bundles is associated with improved time to continence after radical prostatectomy but not long-term continence rates: results of a systematic review and meta-analysis.', ""Intrafascial nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy improves patients' postoperative continence recovery and erectile function: A pooled analysis based on available literatures."", 'Exploring the Applications of Indocyanine Green in Robot-Assisted Urological Surgery: A Comprehensive Review of Fluorescence-Guided Techniques.', 'Advanced Reconstruction of Vesicourethral Support May Improve Urinary Continence and Quality of Life After Non-nerve-sparing Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Impact of Pelvic Anatomical Changes Caused by Radical Prostatectomy.', 'NeuroSAFE in radical prostatectomy increases the rate of nerve-sparing surgery without affecting oncological outcome.', 'Radical or Not-So-Radical Prostatectomy: Do Surgical Margins Matter?']"""

Despite limited evidence, non-physician providers now perform a number of routine urological procedures such as transrectal ultrasound-guided prostatic biopsies (TRUSP) in a bid to help relieve this increasing workload. In the largest series to date, we provide evidence that an adequately trained non-physician provider is able to perform TRUSP as effectively as an experienced urologist after an initial learning curve.  Objective:   To evaluate differences in cancer detection rates between a trained non-physician provider (NPP) and an experienced urologist performing transrectal ultrasound-guided prostatic biopsies (TRUSP) at a single UK institution.  Patients and methods:   We retrospectively analysed a prospectively accrued database of patients (n = 440) referred for investigation of an abnormal digital rectal examination and/or a raised age-specific prostate-specific antigen (PSA) value undergoing first-time outpatient prostatic biopsies who were sequentially allocated to either an NPP or a physician-led TRUSP clinic. Differences in overall and risk-stratified prostate cancer detection rates were evaluated according to TRUSP operator. Continuous variables were analysed using Mann-Whitney U test whereas categorical variables were analysed using Pearson's chi-squared test. A multivariate binary logistic regression model was fitted for predictors of a positive biopsy.  Results:   In all, 57.3% (126/220) of patients who underwent physician-led TRUSP were diagnosed with prostate cancer compared with 52.7% (116/220) in the NPP-led clinic (P = 0.338). Sub-group analysis revealed a lower cancer detection rate in men presenting with a low PSA level (<9.9 ng/mL) during the first 50 independent TRUSP procedures performed by the NPP (P = 0.014). This initial difference was lost with increasing case volume, suggesting the presence of a learning curve. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed age (odds ratio (OR) 1.054, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.025-1.084, P â¤ 0.001), presenting PSA level (OR 1.05, 95% CI 1.02-1.081, P = 0.001), prostatic volume (OR 0.969, 95% CI 0.958-0.981, P â¤ 0.001) and clinical stage (OR 1.538, 95% CI 1.046-2.261, P = 0.029) to be predictors of a positive prostatic biopsy outcome. The choice of TRUSP operator was not predictive of a positive prostatic biopsy (OR 0.729, 95% CI 0.464-1.146, P = 0.171).  Conclusion:   An adequately trained NPP is able to perform TRUSP as effectively as an experienced urologist after an initial learning curve of 50 cases.""","""['Satoshi Hori', 'Oliver Fuge', 'Kay Trabucchi', 'Peter Donaldson', 'John McLoughlin']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Operator is an independent predictor of detecting prostate cancer at transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy.', 'Clinical efficacy of transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy in men younger than 50 years old with an elevated prostate-specific antigen concentration (>4.0\xa0ng/mL).', 'Can Power Doppler enhanced transrectal ultrasound guided biopsy improve prostate cancer detection on first and repeat prostate biopsy?', 'Safety and morbidity of first and repeat transrectal ultrasound guided prostate needle biopsies: results of a prospective European prostate cancer detection study.', 'Transrectal ultrasound and biopsy in the early diagnosis of prostate cancer.', ""Effect of training and individual operator's expertise on prostate cancer detection through prostate biopsy: Implications for the current quantitative training evaluation system."", 'The association of level of practical experience in transrectal ultrasonography guided prostate biopsy with its diagnostic outcome.', '3D Navigoâ¢ versus TRUS-guided prostate biopsy in prostate cancer detection.', 'Gleason underestimation is predicted by prostate biopsy core length.']"""

To determine the mediating role of prostate enlargement on LUTS severity and PA.  Patients and methods:   The study included 405 men without prostate cancer or prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia. LUTS severity was ascertained using the American Urological Association Symptom Index and prostate size by ultrasonography. PA was assessed using validated questionnaires, with conversion to metabolic equivalent of task (MET)-h/week to estimate leisure-time PA energy expenditure. Analysis used multivariable linear regression, controlling for body mass index (BMI), age, race, and treatment for benign prostatic hyperplasia, cardiovascular disease and diabetes.  Results:   Higher leisure-time PA energy expenditure and light housework activities were significantly associated with lower LUTS severity. Prostate volume was not significantly associated with PA in adjusted analyses, and controlling for prostate volume did not affect the association between LUTS severity and PA. Stratification by BMI showed a moderate interaction (P = 0.052), suggesting that PA was more strongly associated with LUTS severity among obese men.  Conclusions:   In this cross-sectional analysis, leisure-time and home-time PA was inversely associated with LUTS severity. The association between PA and LUTS severity was stronger for irritative symptoms and among obese men, and was not mediated through changes in prostate size.

Using an in vivo murine model of human PCa cell metastasis to bone, we noted that the majority of animals that develop skeletal metastasis have either spinal lesions or lesions in the bones of the hindlimb. Much less frequently, lesions develop in the bones of the forelimb. We therefore speculated whether the environment of the forelimb bones is not permissive for the growth of PCa. Consequently, data on tumor prevalence were normalized to account for the number of PCa cells arriving after intravascular injection, marrow cellularity, and number of hematopoietic stem cell niches. None of these factors were able to account for the observed differences in tumor prevalence. An analysis of differential gene and protein levels identified that growth arrest specific-6 (GAS6) levels were significantly greater in the forelimb versus hindlimb bone marrow. When murine RM1 cells were implanted into subcutaneous spaces in immune competent animals, tumor growth in the GAS6(-/-) animals was greater than in GAS6(+/+) wild-type animals. In an osseous environment, the human PC3 cell line grew significantly better in vertebral body transplants (vossicles) derived from GAS6(-/-) animals than in vossicles derived from GAS6(+/+) animals.

However, the mechanism is not fully understood.  Methods:   Human prostate cancer (HPC) cells were cultured in vitro and cell viability was detected by the CCK-8 assay. The ultrastructure changes were observed under transmission electron microscope (TEM). Chemical staining with acridine orange (AO), MDC or DAPI was used to detect acidic vesicular organelles (AVOs) and alternation of DNA. Expression of LC3 and P21 was detected by Western Blot. Apoptotic rates and cell cycle arrest were detected by FACS.  Results:   Our study demonstrated that after ORI treatment, the proliferations of human prostate cancer (HPC) cell lines PC-3 and LNCaP were inhibited in a concentration and time-dependent manner. ORI induced cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase. A large number of autophagosomes with double-membrane structure and acidic vesicular organelles (AVOs) were detected in the cytoplasm of HPC cells treated with ORI for 24 hours. ORI resulted in the conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II and recruitment of LC3-II to the autophagosomal membranes. Autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA) reduced AVOs formation and inhibited LC3-I to LC3-II conversion. At 48 h, DNA fragmentation, chromatin condensation and disappearance of surface microvilli were detected in ORI-treated cells. ORI induced a significant increase in the number of apoptotic cells (PC-3: 5.4% to 27.0%, LNCaP: 5.3% to 31.0%). Promoting autophagy by nutrient starvation increased cell viability, while inhibition of autophagy by 3-MA promoted cell death. The expression of P21 was increased by ORI, which could be completely reversed by the inhibition of autophagy.  Conclusions:   Our findings indicated that autophagy occurred before the onset of apoptosis and protected cancer cells in ORI-treated HPC cells. P21 was involved in ORI-induced autophagy and apoptosis.

CGRs are characterized by multiple genomic breakpoints and thus have the potential to simultaneously affect multiple genes, fusing some genes and interrupting other genes. Analysis of high-throughput whole-genome shotgun sequencing (WGSS) is beginning to facilitate the discovery and characterization of CGRs, but further development of computational methods is required. We have developed an algorithmic method for identifying CGRs in WGSS data based on shortest alternating paths in breakpoint graphs. Aiming for a method with the highest possible sensitivity, we use breakpoint graphs built from all WGSS data, including sequences with ambiguous genomic origin. Since the majority of cell function is encoded by the transcriptome, we target our search to find CGRs that underlie fusion transcripts predicted from matched high-throughput cDNA sequencing (RNA-seq). We have applied our method, nFuse, to the discovery of CGRs in publicly available data from the well-studied breast cancer cell line HCC1954 and primary prostate tumor sample 963. We first establish the sensitivity and specificity of the nFuse breakpoint prediction and scoring method using breakpoints previously discovered in HCC1954. We then validate five out of six CGRs in HCC1954 and two out of two CGRs in 963. We show examples of gene fusions that would be difficult to discover using methods that do not account for the existence of CGRs, including one important event that was missed in a previous study of the HCC1954 genome. Finally, we illustrate how CGRs may be used to infer the gene expression history of a tumor.""","""['Andrew McPherson', 'Chunxiao Wu', 'Alexander W Wyatt', 'Sohrab Shah', 'Colin Collins', 'S Cenk Sahinalp']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Genome Res""","""['Comrad: detection of expressed rearrangements by integrated analysis of RNA-Seq and low coverage genome sequence data.', 'Identification of complex genomic rearrangements in cancers using CouGaR.', 'Breakpoint profiling of 64 cancer genomes reveals numerous complex rearrangements spawned by homology-independent mechanisms.', 'Using high-throughput sequencing transcriptome data for INDEL detection: challenges for cancer drug discovery.', 'Complex genomic rearrangements: an underestimated cause of rare diseases.', 'Novel gene-intergenic fusion involving ubiquitin E3 ligase UBE3C causes distal hereditary motor neuropathy.', 'Overview of research on fusion genes in prostate cancer.', 'Fusion transcripts and their genomic breakpoints in polyadenylated and ribosomal RNA-minus RNA sequencing data.', 'ChiTaH: a fast and accurate tool for identifying known human chimeric sequences from high-throughput sequencing data.', 'Mako: A Graph-based Pattern Growth Approach to Detect Complex Structural Variants.']"""

Androgen receptor (AR) gene mutation, altered AR regulation, or overexpression of AR often found in CRPC is believed to become one of the key factors to the lethal phenotype. Here we identify Slug, a member of the Snail family of zinc-finger transcription factors associated with cancer metastasis, as a unique androgen-responsive gene in PCa cells. In addition, the presence of constitutively active AR can induce Slug expression in a ligand-independent manner. Slug overexpression will increase AR protein expression and form a complex with AR. In addition, Slug appears to be a novel coactivator to enhance AR transcriptional activities and AR-mediated cell growth with or without androgen. In vivo, elevated Slug expression provides a growth advantage for PCa cells in androgen-deprived conditions. Most importantly, these observations were validated by several data sets from tissue microarrays. Overall, there is a reciprocal regulation between Slug and AR not only in transcriptional regulation but also in protein bioactivity, and Slug-AR complex plays an important role in accelerating the androgen-independent outgrowth of CRPC.""","""['Kaijie Wu', 'Crystal Gore', 'Lin Yang', 'Ladan Fazli', 'Martin Gleave', 'Rey-Chen Pong', 'Guanghua Xiao', 'Linlin Zhang', 'Eun-Jin Yun', 'Shu-Fen Tseng', 'Payal Kapur', 'Dalin He', 'Jer-Tsong Hsieh']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Mol Endocrinol""","""['Androgen receptor variants occur frequently in castration resistant prostate cancer metastases.', 'Hedgehog/Gli supports androgen signaling in androgen deprived and androgen independent prostate cancer cells.', 'Increased PrLZ-mediated androgen receptor transactivation promotes prostate cancer growth at castration-resistant stage.', 'Increased androgen receptor transcription: a cause of castration-resistant prostate cancer and a possible therapeutic target.', 'Androgen receptor cofactors in prostate cancer: potential therapeutic targets of castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Emergent dynamics of underlying regulatory network links EMT and androgen receptor-dependent resistance in prostate cancer.', 'Cancer Stemness/Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition Axis Influences Metastasis and Castration Resistance in Prostate Cancer: Potential Therapeutic Target.', 'The DNA/RNA helicase DHX9 contributes to the transcriptional program of the androgen receptor in prostate cancer.', 'ISL1 promotes enzalutamide resistance in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) through epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT).', 'LncRNA PAINT is associated with aggressive prostate cancer and dysregulation of cancer hallmark genes.']"""

We compared the automated and semi-automated bone scan index (BSI) system with extent of disease (EOD) grade if there is a possibility to substitute for EOD grading.  Materials and methods:   We evaluated the bone scintigraphic images of 158 prostate carcinoma patients (mean age, 69.2 years old; range 50-97). Bone scans were obtained approximately 3 h after the intravenous injection of 740 MBq technetium-99 m-methylene diphosphonate. EOD grade was evaluated by 2 experienced radiologists using bone scintigraphy, magnetic resonance imaging, and computed tomography. We calculated the BSI using the Bonenavi(Â®) system (Fujifilm RI Pharma Co., Ltd.), utilizing data from a Japanese database. The semi-automated BSI of the patients was obtained by modifying the automated BSI independently by 3 radiologists (referred to as ""observers"" in this study) with 25, 10, and 4 years of experience. We then compared the EOD with the corresponding 4 independent BSIs for each patient. We used the Steel-Dwass test for multiple comparisons of the BSI among different EOD groups of patients. We analyzed the receiver-operating characteristics (ROC) curve to determine the cutoff values of sensitivity and specificity, which were both set at 95 %.  Results:   There were significant correlations observed among the mean EOD and BSI scores as determined using the Bonenavi(Â®) system for every patient group for all observers and the automated method. There was also a statistically significant difference in the mean BSI among all EOD groups (grades 0, 1, or 2-4) for all observers and the automated method. Each ROC curve showed an ideal shape and was within the optimal cutoff range.  Conclusion:   On the basis of the present results, BSI as calculated using the Bonenavi(Â®) system significantly correlated with EOD. Sensitivity and specificity as measured by the fully automated method were lower than those of semi-automated BSI with modification by radiologists. Therefore, semi-automated BSI is considered to have the possibility to substitute for EOD grading to predict the survival of prostate carcinoma patients with bone metastases, with only slight interobserver variation.""","""['Yoshiko Takahashi', 'Mana Yoshimura', 'Kunihito Suzuki', 'Tsuyoshi Hashimoto', 'Hideji Hirose', 'Kenji Uchida', 'Shingo Inoue', 'Kiyoshi Koizumi', 'Koichi Tokuuye']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Ann Nucl Med""","""['Analytic Validation of the Automated Bone Scan Index as an Imaging Biomarker to Standardize Quantitative Changes in Bone Scans of Patients with Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Evaluation of bone scan index change over time on automated calculation in bone scintigraphy.', 'Bone scintigraphy as a new imaging biomarker: the relationship between bone scan index and bone metabolic markers in prostate cancer patients with bone metastases.', 'Scoring systems of quantitative bone scanning in prostate cancer: historical overview, current status and future perspectives.', 'Measuring the unmeasurable: automated bone scan index as a quantitative endpoint in prostate cancer clinical trials.', 'The DASciS Software for BSI Calculation as a Valuable Prognostic Tool in mCRPC Treated with 223RaCl2: A Multicenter Italian Study.', 'Novel diagnostic model for bone metastases in renal cell carcinoma patients based on bone scintigraphy analyzed by computer-aided diagnosis software and bone turnover markers.', 'Systematic review & meta-analysis of positron emission tomography/computed tomography and bone scan in the diagnosis of prostate lesions.', 'Current state of bone scintigraphy protocols and practice in Japan.', 'Assessment of Skeletal Tumor Load in Metastasized Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Patients: A Review of Available Methods and an Overview on Future Perspectives.']"""

Recently, a European consensus meeting proposed the use of a simple 5-point scale for estimating the probability of a lesion being malignant. The aim of the present study was to determine the inter-reader agreement of MR imaging using a scoring system based on the recommendations of the consensus.  Materials and methods:   The appearance of 108 predefined lesions in three different MR sequences (T2-weighted images, DWI, and DCE-MRI) in 50 functional prostate MR examinations were retrospectively scored by three blinded radiologists using a 5-point scale for each MR sequence. After scoring T2/DWI and T2/DWI/DCE-MRI, every lesion was graded based on its probability for malignancy. The inter-observer reliability was evaluated using Kappa statistics (Ä¸).  Results:   With respect to T2-weighted images, DWI and DCE-MRI Ä¸ was 0.49, 0.97, and 0.77, respectively. Combined scoring of T2-weighted images and DWI demonstrated correct tumor diagnosis (true positive) in 71-88% (depending on reader) of cases (Ä¸=0.78). The accuracy was further improved to 88-96% after scoring all three MR sequences including DCE-MRI (Ä¸=0.90).

Analyzing data for multiple time-point treatments with a view toward optimal treatment regimes is of interest in many types of afflictions: HIV infection, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder in children, leukemia, prostate cancer, renal failure, and many others. Methods for analyzing data from SRCTs exist but they are either inefficient or suffer from the drawbacks of estimating equation methodology. We describe an estimation procedure, targeted maximum likelihood estimation (TMLE), which has been fully developed and implemented in point treatment settings, including time to event outcomes, binary outcomes and continuous outcomes. Here we develop and implement TMLE in the SRCT setting.

Methods:   Using the search terms ""advanced prostate cancer"", ""prostate cancer"", ""intermittent androgen blockade"", ""continuous androgen blockade"", ""randomized controlled trial"" (RCT), the literature in Chinese and English language was searched in several databases to see for any difference between IAB and CAB concerning the effectiveness, QoL and side effects. Then, the studies to be included were identified according to previously established inclusion criteria, and those selected were assessed by methodological quality. Finally, the data of the studies included were extracted using self-tabulate tables, and the criteria of RCTs were studied. At the same time, odds ratio (OR) and weighted mean difference (WMD) of random effects model and fixed effects model were calculated to evaluate sensitivity.  Results:   There were 16 RCTs that compared IAB with CAB with a total of 3264 patients (1624 with IAB and 1640 with CAB). Pooled effects indicated no significant difference between IAB and CAB groups in terms of death and progression rate (OR=0.99, 95% CI 0.80-1.23, and OR=1.03, 95% CI 0.84-1.26 respectively). Calculated results indicated that QoL on sexual activity was significantly higher in the IAB group (OR=0.24, 95% Cl 0.17-0.33, p<0.00001). Moreover, IAB could effectively reduce side effects.  Conclusion:   The therapeutic efficacy (progression and death rate) was not significantly different between the IAB and CAB groups. However, IAB can effectively preserve the QoL (sexual life) and reduce the side effects.

Physical activity is a significant supportive care management strategy for prostate cancer survivors, though the optimal modality is not yet understood.  Hypotheses:   The authors hypothesized that yoga would be a feasible physical activity option for prostate cancer survivors and their support persons and that the incorporation of social support would increase physical activity adherence.  Methods:   This 14-week feasibility study involved a 7-week class-based yoga program (adherence phase), followed by 7 weeks of self-selected physical activity (maintenance phase). Demographic information, physical activity behavior, quality of life, fatigue, stress, mood, and fitness variables were assessed at 3 time points. Prostate cancer survivors' perceived social support was rated during yoga and after yoga.  Results:   Class attendance was 6.1 and 5.8 for prostate cancer survivors (n = 15) and their support persons (n = 10), respectively, for the 7 classes. Levels of perceived social support were higher for those who brought a support person. Significant improvements with regard to stress, fatigue, and mood before and after yoga class (all Ps < .05) were reported by all participants. No clinically significant changes were noted on prostate cancer survivor's quality of life or fatigue over the course of the 14-week study.  Conclusions:   Yoga is a feasible physical activity option for prostate cancer survivors.

Treatment often includes androgendeprivation therapy (ADT), which results in a range of side effects (e.g., fatigue, urinary dysfunction) that further impact HRQOL. Despite these challenges, there are limited evaluations of the impact of stress and stress management skills on HRQOL among APC survivors on ADT. This study evaluated relationships among stress, stress management skills, and HRQOL, and it was hypothesized that better stress management skills would relate to greater physical and emotional well-being by mitigating perceived stress levels. Participants (N = 77) were 69.7 years old (SD = 9.8), 18.6 months post-treatment (SD = 17.5), and ethnically diverse (65 % Non-Hispanic White, 13 % Hispanic, 21 % African-American). Measures included the Measure of Current Status for stress management skills, the Perceived Stress Scale for perceived stress, and the Medical Outcomes Study-Short Form (MOS SF-36; physical functioning and emotional well-being subscales) for HRQOL. Direct effects and mediation models were evaluated to determine the relationships between perceived stress, stress management skills, and HRQOL domains, controlling for relevant covariates. Stress management skills and perceived stress were significantly associated with physical functioning (Î² = .24, p < .05 and Î² = -.43, p < .01, respectively) and emotional well-being (Î² = .35, p < .01 and Î² = -.64, p < .01, respectively). Regression analyses supported the hypothesis that reduced perceived stress mediated the relationship between stress management skills and both physical functioning and emotional well-being.

Our previous studies showed that DADS inhibits cell growth and induces apoptosis on prostate cancer cells. Insulin like growth factor signaling pathway plays a significant role on prostate cancer cell growth and survival and it's over expression also identified in human prostate cancers. The molecular mechanism of IGF mediated PI3K/Akt signaling remains to be elucidated. The present study was designed to evaluate the effects of diallyl disulfide on IGF signaling in androgen independent prostate cancer cells (PC-3).  Methods:   DADS (10-50 Î¼M) caused dose-dependent inhibition of PC-3 cells, were analyzed by MTT, IC50 value of PC-3 cells was 40 Î¼M for 24h. Interestingly, DADS also altered the mRNA and protein expressions of IGF signaling and apoptotic molecules which were confirmed by semi quantitative PCR and western blot method. Further the docking study of DADS with IGF receptor was carried out by Ligand Fit of Discovery studio. Accord Excel Package was used for the prediction of ADME properties of the compound.  Results:   The results suggests that DADS decreases the survival rate of androgen independent prostate cancer cells by modulating the expression of IGF system, which leads to inhibition of phosphorylation of Akt, thereby inhibits cell cycle progression and survival by lowering the expression of cyclin D1, NFkB and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 molecule and increasing the level of pro-apoptotic (Bad and Bax) signaling molecules which leads to apoptosis.  Conclusion:   The present investigation showed downregulation of Akt and a concomitant increase in apoptosis in DADS treated prostate cancer cells. Since inhibition of this Akt pathway by DADS leads to inhibition in cancer cell progression, it is highly suggested that DADS has the potential use as a therapy for prostate cancer.""","""['R Arunkumar', 'G Sharmila', 'P Elumalai', 'K Senthilkumar', 'S Banudevi', 'D N Gunadharini', 'C S Benson', 'P Daisy', 'J Arunakaran']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Phytomedicine""","""['Effect of zinc on regulation of insulin-like growth factor signaling in human androgen-independent prostate cancer cells.', 'Diallyl disulfide causes caspase-dependent apoptosis in human cancer cells through a Bax-triggered mitochondrial pathway.', 'Diallyl Disulfide Induces Apoptosis and Autophagy in Human Osteosarcoma MG-63 Cells through the PI3K/Akt/mTOR Pathway.', 'Molecular mechanisms for the anti-cancer effects of diallyl disulfide.', 'A comprehensive understanding about the pharmacological effect of diallyl disulfide other than its anti-carcinogenic activities.', 'Structure-Guided Approach to Discover Tuberosin as a Potent Activator of Pyruvate Kinase M2, Targeting Cancer Therapy.', 'Diallyl Disulfide: A Bioactive Garlic Compound with Anticancer Potential.', 'Identification of Phytoconstituents as Potent Inhibitors of Casein Kinase-1 Alpha Using Virtual Screening and Molecular Dynamics Simulations.', 'Chinese nutraceuticals and physical activity; their role in neurodegenerative tauopathies.', 'Immunomodulatory effect of diallyl sulfide on experimentally-induced benign prostate hyperplasia via the suppression of CD4+T/IL-17 and TGF-Î²1/ERK pathways.']"""

In contrast poor soft tissue contrast between prostate and surrounding tissues in computed tomography (CT) images pose a challenge in accurate prostate segmentation.

The objective of this work is to study the key similarities and differences among the different methods, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses in order to assist in the choice of an appropriate segmentation methodology. We define a new taxonomy for prostate segmentation strategies that allows first to group the algorithms and then to point out the main advantages and drawbacks of each strategy.

The aim of the current study was to examine the model of cell-to-cell interaction between PBMC and prostate cancer cells from two lines - androgen resistant (PC-3) and androgen-dependent (LNCaP). For that purpose, cancer cells from both lines were incubated with PBMC, and cytokine secretion by PBMC was evaluated. The results showed a cell-concentration dependent increase in secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 by PBMC induced by cells from both lines, whereas generation of IL-1Î² and the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 were found to be increased after incubation with PC-3 cells only. The secretion of IL-10 was slightly lower following incubation of PBMC with supernatants derived from PC-3 cells. The results of the study support the possibility that prostate cancer cell-induced cytokine production by PBMC, and particularly IL-6, are involved in prostate cancer development.

The secondary aim was to evaluate the ""learning curve"" for the procedure. The following parameters were compared: the radiation dose to 90% of the prostate volume (D90), the radiation dose to 30% of the urethral volume (DU30), the percentage of the prostate volume receiving 100% or 200% of the prescribed dose (V100 or V200, respectively), the percentage of the rectal volume receiving 100% of the prescribed dose (VR100), and the homogeneity index (HI).

Methods and materials:   We retrospectively reviewed 13 patients diagnosed with IBD from a cohort of over 3200 patients with low- to intermediate-risk prostate cancer treated with (125)I brachytherapy (144Gy). Acute (i.e. <12 months) and late lower GI toxicity after brachytherapy using the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) grading system was assessed. Possible factors (e.g. patient, treatment, dosimetry, and characteristics of IBD) influencing GI toxicity were assessed.  Results:   Median followup was 4.2 years. Ten patients had ulcerative colitis (UC) and 3 had Crohn's disease. Seven patients with UC had known involvement of the rectum. Acute RTOG GI Grade 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 toxicity was seen in 7, 1, 2, 2, 1 patients, respectively. The corresponding late RTOG GI toxicity was seen in 7, 1, 3, 1, 1 patients, respectively.

All patients with severe GI toxicity (i.e., Grade â¥3) had UC with disease involving the rectum and underwent endoscopic biopsies of the rectum within 3 months after the implant. There was no clear association with other factors with toxicity.  Conclusions:   Twenty-three percent and 15% patients with IBD experienced Grade 3 or higher acute and late GI toxicity, respectively, after brachytherapy. Prostate brachytherapy should be used with great caution or avoided, particularly for men with active IBD involving the rectum.

However, the impact of the extent of pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND) on EF has never been addressed.  Aim:   The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of ePLND on potency recovery in patients who underwent bilateral nerve-sparing RP (BNSRP).  Methods:   The study included 396 patients with prostate cancer treated with BNSRP by two high-volume surgeons. Patients were retrospectively divided into two groups based on PLND status: no PLND (N=161; 40.9%) and ePLND (N=235; 59.1%) at the time of BNSRP. All patients had preoperative functional and oncological data. Univariable and multivariable Cox regression models tested the association between ePLND and EF recovery after surgery, after accounting for confounders.  Main outcome measure:   The International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) was used to evaluate EF after BNSRP. Postoperative EF recovery was defined as an IIEF-EF domain score â¥ 22.  Results:   At a mean follow up of 33.2 months after surgery (median 30), 183 patients (46.2%) recovered EF. Overall, postoperative EF recovery rate at 2 years was 48.4%. No significant differences were recorded when patients were stratified according to the extent of PLND (EF recovery rates at 2-year: 46.6% vs. 49.7% for patients who did not undergo PLND vs. those treated with ePLND; P=0.33). These results were confirmed at multivariable analyses, where only age at surgery and preoperative IIEF-EF (all P â¤ 0.03), but not ePLND (P=0.8), represented independent predictors of EF recovery.  Conclusions:   The extent of PLND is not associated with potency after BNSRP. Conversely, other factors such as age at surgery and preoperative EF represent the major predictors of postoperative potency recovery. Therefore, when indicated, ePLND can be safely performed without compromising EF outcomes.""","""['Giorgio Gandaglia', 'Nazareno Suardi', 'Andrea Gallina', 'Firas Abdollah', 'Umberto Capitanio', 'Andrea Salonia', 'Renzo Colombo', 'Marco Bianchi', 'Felix K Chun', 'Jens Hansen', 'Patrizio Rigatti', 'Francesco Montorsi', 'Alberto Briganti']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""J Sex Med""","""['Extended versus limited pelvic lymph node dissection during bilateral nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy and its effect on continence and erectile function recovery: long-term results and trifecta rates of a comparative analysis.', 'Predicting erectile function recovery after bilateral nerve sparing radical prostatectomy: a proposal of a novel preoperative risk stratification.', 'Erectile Function Recovery After Nerve-Sparing Radical Prostatectomy for Prostate Cancer: Is Back to Baseline Status Enough for Patient Satisfaction?', 'The Benefits and Harms of Different Extents of Lymph Node Dissection During Radical Prostatectomy for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review.', 'Pelvic lymph node dissection in prostate cancer.', 'Comparison of Functional Outcome after Extended versus Super-Extended Pelvic Lymph Node Dissection during Radical Prostatectomy in High-Risk Localized Prostate Cancer.', 'Postprostatectomy Erectile Dysfunction: A Review.', 'Penile rehabilitation after radical prostatectomy: does it work?', 'Extended versus limited pelvic lymph node dissection during bilateral nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy and its effect on continence and erectile function recovery: long-term results and trifecta rates of a comparative analysis.', 'Preoperative erectile function is the only predictor of the use of a high number of phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitors after bilateral nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy.']"""

Melatonin reduces proliferation without increasing apoptosis, and it promotes cell differentiation into a neuroendocrine phenotype. Because neuroendocrine cells displayed an androgen-independent growth and high resistance to radiotherapy and chemotherapy, the role of molecules that induce neuroendocrine differentiation was questioned in terms of their usefulness as oncostatic agents. By using human epithelial androgen-dependent and androgen-independent prostate cancer cells, the role of melatonin in drug-induced apoptosis was studied after acute treatments. In addition to cytokines such as hrTNF-alpha and TRAIL, chemotherapeutic compounds, including doxorubicin, docetaxel, or etoposide, were employed in combination with melatonin to promote cell death. Melatonin promotes cell toxicity caused by cytokines without influencing the actions of chemotherapeutic agents. In addition, antioxidant properties of melatonin were confirmed in prostate cancer cells. However, its ability to increase cell death caused by cytokines was independent of the redox changes. Finally, phenotypic changes caused by chronic treatment with the indole, that is, neuroendocrine differentiation, make cells significantly more sensitive to cytokines and slightly more sensitive to some chemotherapeutic compounds. Thus, melatonin is a good inhibitor of the proliferation of prostate cancer cells, promoting phenotypic changes that do not increase survival mechanisms and make cells more sensitive to cytokines such as TNF-alpha or TRAIL.""","""['Aida Rodriguez-Garcia', 'Juan C Mayo', 'David Hevia', 'Isabel Quiros-Gonzalez', 'Maria Navarro', 'Rosa M Sainz']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Pineal Res""","""['Drug interactions between the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib and cytotoxic chemotherapy, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha, and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand in prostate cancer.', 'Critical role of glutathione in melatonin enhancement of tumor necrosis factor and ionizing radiation-induced apoptosis in prostate cancer cells in vitro.', 'Resistance of prostate cancer cells to soluble TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL/Apo2L) can be overcome by doxorubicin or adenoviral delivery of full-length TRAIL.', 'Melatonin, a Full Service Anti-Cancer Agent: Inhibition of Initiation, Progression and Metastasis.', 'Basic mechanisms involved in the anti-cancer effects of melatonin.', 'Adipokines regulate mesenchymal stem cell osteogenic differentiation.', 'Melatonin and Prostate Cancer: Anti-tumor Roles and Therapeutic Application.', 'Melatonin is a potential oncostatic agent to inhibit HepG2 cell proliferation through multiple pathways.', 'Melatonin as a Therapeutic Agent for the Inhibition of Hypoxia-Induced Tumor Progression: A Description of Possible Mechanisms Involved.', 'Roles of circadian clocks in cancer pathogenesis and treatment.']"""

Monascuspiloin effectively inhibits the growth of both androgen-dependent LNCaP and androgen-independent PC-3 human prostate cancer cells. Monascuspiloin preferentially induces apoptosis in LNCaP cells by attenuating the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. In androgen-independent PC-3 cells, monascuspiloin induces G2/M arrest and autophagic cell death by an AMPK-dependent pathway. Induction of autophagy in PC-3 cells further sensitizes cells to apoptosis induced by monascuspiloin.

Methods:   Among men with prostate cancer in the prospective Physicians' Health and Health Professionals Follow-Up Studies, we identified rearrangement status by immunohistochemical assessment of ERG protein expression. We used Cox models to examine associations of ERG overexpression with biochemical recurrence and lethal disease (distant metastases or cancer-specific mortality). In a meta-analysis including 47 additional studies, we used random-effects models to estimate associations between rearrangement status and outcomes.  Results:   The cohort consisted of 1,180 men treated with radical prostatectomy between 1983 and 2005. During a median follow-up of 12.6 years, 266 men experienced recurrence and 85 men developed lethal disease.

Methods:   An inter-institutional retrospective cohort study compared outcomes for patients who received SRT at 2 separate academic institutions with disparate treatment paradigms: almost exclusively favoring WPRT (n = 112) versus limiting treatment to the prostate bed (PBRT) (n = 135). Patients were excluded if they had lymph node involvement or if they received androgen-deprivation therapy. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to adjust for potential confounders.  Results:   In total, 247 patients were analyzed with a median follow-up of 4 years. The pre-SRT prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.58; P < .0001) and a Gleason score of 8 to 10 (adjusted HR, 3.21; P < .0001) were identified as independent predictors of increased risk of biochemical PSA progression after SRT.

Neither low-risk patients nor high-risk patients (defined a priori by a preoperative PSA level â¥20 ng/mL, a pathologic Gleason score between 8 and 10, or pathologic T3 tumor classification) benefited from WPRT. Overall survival was similar between treatment groups.

Methods:   715 men who underwent a transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy in Tayside region of Scotland between April 2007 and September 2011 were identified from hospital records using their unique Community Health Index Number. Multiple hospital electronic databases (Central Vision, Insite, Wisdom, and TOPAS) and departmental-based resources (morbidity and mortality records, daily ward electronic records) were linked to estimate urological complications (urinary tract infection, urinary retention, haematuria) and rates of hospital admission. Cross-validation of information was obtained by searching a drug dispensing information network and microbiology database for infective complications. The hospital admission rate was compared for two different prophylactic antibiotic regimens used during the study period.  Results:   Of the 715 men who underwent transrectal ultrasound biopsy, 386 (53.9 %) were diagnosed with prostate cancer and 329 (46.1 %) were found to have benign histology. The hospital admission rate for urological complications within 30 days of the procedure for men without cancer was 1.95 % (14/715). The 30-day hospital admission rate was not different for different regimens of prophylactic antibiotics. There were 50 (6.99 %; 50/715) urine cultures requested to the microbiology department within 30 days of procedures; out of which 20 (2.79 %; 20/715) were positive. Most of these were generated from general practice requests. Eight blood cultures obtained within the same period were all negative. Eleven patients (1.7 %) presented with urinary retention during the same period and required indwelling catheterisation. None of them had any surgical procedure. Validation of electronic record linkage against telephonic questionnaires by specialist nurse showed a high reliability of the methodology (Îº = 0.91).  Conclusion:   High quality validated record linkage of cohort data in the present study using a unique identifier, protocol-based procedure and antibiotic prophylaxis showed that hospitalisation following TRUS biopsies occurs in less than 2 % of patients.

Data from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial were used and simple decision analytic techniques were applied to compare different eligibility criteria for a screening trial.  Methods:   For a variety of possible eligibility criteria, the percentage of the population aged 55 years to 74 years and classified as being at high risk for developing invasive or high-grade carcinoma, and therefore likely to benefit from screening, was calculated. Regression models were used to calculate a risk score based on age, sex, smoking history, and family history of bladder cancer. The reduction in cases was calculated given hypothetical risk reductions associated with screening. The trade-off between patients screened and tumors avoided was calculated as a net benefit.  Results:   The 5-year probability of being diagnosed with invasive bladder cancer was 0.24%. Using a risk score > 6 or > 8 as the eligibility criterion for a trial was generally superior to including all older adults. In a typical scenario, a risk score > 6 would result in approximately 25% of the population being screened to prevent 57 invasive or high-grade bladder cancers per 100,000 population; screening the entire population would prevent only an additional 38 cases.  Conclusions:   Screening for bladder cancer can be optimized by restricting it to a subgroup of patients considered to be at elevated risk.

TRAIL is a potent stimulator of apoptosis in cancer cells and an important immune effector molecule in the surveillance and elimination of developing tumours. However, many cancer cells are resistant to TRAIL-mediated death. In this study, we aimed to determine the mechanisms by which TRAIL resistance can be overcome in prostate cancer cells by 3,5-diprenyl-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (artepillin C). Artepillin C is a bioactive component of Brazilian green propolis that possesses antitumour and chemopreventive activities. TRAIL-resistant LNCaP prostate cancer cells were treated with TRAIL and artepillin C. Cytotoxicity was measured by MTT and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assays. Apoptosis was detected using Annexin V-FITC staining by flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy. Death receptor (DR) (TRAIL-R1/DR4 and TRAIL-R2/DR5) expression was analyzed using flow cytometry. Mitochondrial membrane potential (âÏm) was evaluated using DePsipher staining by fluorescence micro-scopy. The inhibition of NF-ÎºB (p65) activation was confirmed with the ELISA-based TransAM NF-ÎºB kit. Caspase-8 and caspase-3 activities were determined by colorimetric protease assays. The results showed that artepillin C sensitized the TRAIL-resistant LNCaP cells by engaging the extrinsic (receptor-mediated) and intrinsic (mitochondrial) apoptotic pathways. Artepillin C increased the expression of TRAIL-R2 and decreased the activity of NF-ÎºB. Co-treatment with TRAIL and artepillin C induced the significant activation of caspase-8 and caspase-3, as well as the disruption of âÏm. These findings show that prostate cancer cells can be sensitized to TRAIL-mediated immunoprevention by artepillin C and confirm the role of phenolic compounds in prostate cancer immunochemoprevention.""","""['Ewelina Szliszka', 'Grzegorz Zydowicz', 'Elzbieta Mizgala', 'Wojciech Krol']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Int J Oncol""","""['Ethanolic extract of Brazilian green propolis sensitizes prostate cancer cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis.', 'The dietary flavonol fisetin enhances the apoptosis-inducing potential of TRAIL in prostate cancer cells.', 'The dietary isoflavone biochanin-A sensitizes prostate cancer cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis.', 'Compartmentalization of TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) death receptor functions: emerging role of nuclear TRAIL-R2.', 'The role of TRADD in death receptor signaling.', 'Molecular and Cellular Mechanisms of Propolis and Its Polyphenolic Compounds against Cancer.', 'Pharmacological Small Molecules against Prostate Cancer by Enhancing Function of Death Receptor 5.', 'Phosphatidylserine Exposed Lipid Bilayer Models for Understanding Cancer Cell Selectivity of Natural Compounds: A Molecular Dynamics Simulation Study.', 'Death Receptor 5 (TNFRSF10B) Is Upregulated and TRAIL Resistance Is Reversed in Hypoxia and Normoxia in Colorectal Cancer Cell Lines after Treatment with Skyrin, the Active Metabolite of Hypericum spp.', 'Changes in the Concentration of Markers Participating in the Regulation of the Apoptosis Receptor Pathway Involving Soluble Tumour Necrosis Factor Ligand inducing Apoptosis (sTRAIL) and Osteoprotegerin (OPG) in the Serum of Women with Ovarian Cancer-Participation in Pathogenesis or a Possible Clinical Use?']"""

Previously, rates of potency preservation with or without external beam radiation and/ or hormone therapy have been published with smaller series and limited follow-up. The study provides greater numbers and longer follow-up giving patients and clinicians a better appreciation of the true potency preservation rates in this population and how various factors such as age, hormone use and external beam affect those rates.  Objectives:   â¢ To assess potency preservation in men following brachytherapy for prostate cancer with or without external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) and/or androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). â¢ To evaluate the factors that significantly impact this rate.  Patients and methods:   â¢ In all, 1063 potent men with T1-T3 prostate cancer were treated from 1990 to 2007 with seed implantation alone ((103) Pd or (125) I) (69.6%) or combined modality treatment consisting of a partial dose (103) Pd implant followed 6-8 weeks later by EBRT (45 Gy, prostate/seminal vesicles only) (30.4%). ADT was used in 49.1% of cases (range 1-27 months). â¢ Patients were required to have a minimum of 2 years follow-up and to be off ADT for a minimum of 1 year. â¢ Erectile function was assessed prior to seed implantation and at each follow-up visit using the physician-assigned Mount Sinai Erectile Function Score (MSEFS): 0, unable to have erections; 1, erections insufficient for intercourse; 2, suboptimal erections but sufficient for intercourse; 3, normal erectile function. Potent was defined as a score of greater than or equal to 2 with or without use of a phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor. â¢ The potency rate was calculated using actuarial methods with comparisons tested by log-rank and Cox regression analysis.  Results:   â¢ The 5-year and 10-year actuarial rate of potency preservation was 68.0% and 57.9%, respectively, at last follow-up. â¢ On multivariate analysis, 5- and 10-year potency was 87.6% (79.5%) for men younger than 60, 68.0% (57.5%) for age 60-70, and 42.2% (31.0%) for men older than 70 (P < 0.001). â¢ Pretreatment MSEFS of 2 had a potency rate of 51.7% (37.2%) vs 74.2% (65.2%) for an MSEFS of 3 (P < 0.001). â¢ There was a 75.8% (62.6%) potency rate without ADT vs 60.0% (53.0%) with ADT (P < 0.001). â¢ Five-year potency was 76.4% for implant alone, 71.0% for implant with EBRT, 62.2% for implant with ADT, and 57.9% for implant with EBRT and ADT (P < 0.001).
