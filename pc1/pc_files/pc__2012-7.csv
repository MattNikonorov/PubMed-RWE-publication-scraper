MTT assays were employed to assess the effects of many drugs, including disulfiram, on cell viability.  Results:   ATF3 protein expression was up-regulated after cytotoxic doses of cisplatin treatment and it directly bound to the CHOP gene promoter, increasing this pro-apoptotic protein's expression. In a library screen of 1200 compounds, disulfiram, a dithiocarbamate drug, was identified as an enhancer of the cytotoxic effects of cisplatin.

Resistance to abi invariably occurs, probably due in part to upregulation of steroidogenic enzymes and/or other mechanisms that sustain dihydrotestosterone (DHT) synthesis, which raises the possibility of reversing resistance by concomitant inhibition of other required steroidogenic enzymes. On the basis of the 3β-hydroxyl, Δ(5)-structure, we hypothesized that abi also inhibits 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/isomerase (3βHSD), which is absolutely required for DHT synthesis in CRPC, regardless of origins or routes of synthesis.  Experimental design:   We tested the effects of abi on 3βHSD activity, androgen receptor localization, expression of androgen receptor-responsive genes, and CRPC growth in vivo.  Results:   Abi inhibits recombinant 3βHSD activity in vitro and endogenous 3βHSD activity in LNCaP and LAPC4 cells, including conversion of [(3)H]-dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) to Δ(4)-androstenedione, androgen receptor nuclear translocation, expression of androgen receptor-responsive genes, and xenograft growth in orchiectomized mice supplemented with DHEA. Abi also blocks conversion of Δ(5)-androstenediol to testosterone by 3βHSD. Abi inhibits 3βHSD1 and 3βHSD2 enzymatic activity in vitro; blocks conversion from DHEA to androstenedione and DHT with an IC(50) value of less than 1 μmol/L in CRPC cell lines; inhibits androgen receptor nuclear translocation; expression of TMPRSS2, prostate-specific antigen, and FKBP5; and decreases CRPC xenograft growth in DHEA-supplemented mice.  Conclusions:   We conclude that abi inhibits 3βHSD-mediated conversion of DHEA to active androgens in CRPC. This second mode of action might be exploited to reverse resistance to CYP17A1 inhibition at the standard abi dose by dose-escalation or simply by administration with food to increase drug exposure.""","""['Rui Li', 'Kristen Evaul', 'Kamalesh K Sharma', 'Kai-Hsiung Chang', 'Jennifer Yoshimoto', 'Jiayan Liu', 'Richard J Auchus', 'Nima Sharifi']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Clin Cancer Res""","""['3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase is a possible pharmacological target in the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'New agents and strategies for the hormonal treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Steroidogenic enzyme AKR1C3 is a novel androgen receptor-selective coactivator that promotes prostate cancer growth.', 'Conversion of abiraterone to D4A drives anti-tumour activity in prostate cancer.', 'Clinical implications of the 5α-androstanedione pathway for castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Androgen Metabolism and Response in Prostate Cancer Anti-Androgen Therapy Resistance.', 'Intracrine androgen biosynthesis and drug resistance.', 'Aldo-Keto Reductases and Cancer Drug Resistance.', 'Upregulation of glucocorticoid receptor-mediated glucose transporter 4 in enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Improved Dissolution and Pharmacokinetics of Abiraterone through KinetiSol® Enabled Amorphous Solid Dispersions.']"""

Methods:   Tissue microarrays from prostatectomy specimens were derived from 53 patients treated preoperatively with androgen ablation (AA) with or without chemotherapy, and from 26 stage- and grade-matched controls. A previously characterized androgen-regulated human prostate cancer xenograft was used to conduct parallel murine studies. Expression of markers of interest was determined on both untreated and castrated tumors.  Results:   Four-month exposure to AA or AA with chemotherapy led to a uniform increase in Hh signaling as compared to controls, paired with an inverse trend of androgen receptor (AR) and CYP17 expression in clinically derived specimens. Changes in the expression profiles of Hh signaling were observed in the epithelium and stroma, in response to genotoxic stress of androgen ablation and chemotherapy. A reduced expression of KI67 and increased bcl2 expression was observed in the malignant epithelial compartment.  Conclusion:   To our knowledge, this is the first clinical evidence that Hh signaling is induced by AA or the combination of AA and chemotherapy and, by inference, contributes to castrate-resistant progression of prostate cancer as supported by parallel human and murine studies. These data are in agreement with previous reports that implicate Hh signaling in castrate-resistant progression of prostate cancer. Based on these findings, we are pursuing parallel clinical and murine investigations to determine if Hh signaling inhibition combined with AA will be more effective than AA alone.""","""['Eleni Efstathiou', 'Maria Karlou', 'Sijin Wen', 'Anh Hoang', 'Curtis A Pettaway', 'Louis L Pisters', 'Sankar Maity', 'Patricia Troncoso', 'Christopher J Logothetis']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Hedgehog signaling inhibition by the small molecule smoothened inhibitor GDC-0449 in the bone forming prostate cancer xenograft MDA PCa 118b.', 'TAK-441, a novel investigational smoothened antagonist, delays castration-resistant progression in prostate cancer by disrupting paracrine hedgehog signaling.', 'Sox2 is an androgen receptor-repressed gene that promotes castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Molecular biology of castration-resistant prostate cancer: basis for the novel therapeutic targets.', 'Oxidative stress and androgen receptor signaling in the development and progression of castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Patched 1 Expression Correlates with Biochemical Relapse in High-Risk Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'Inhibition of Gli1-mediated prostate cancer cell proliferation by inhibiting the mTOR/S6K1 signaling pathway.', 'Pharmacodynamic study of the oral hedgehog pathway inhibitor, vismodegib, in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Tissue Effects in a Randomized Controlled Trial of Short-term Finasteride in Early Prostate Cancer.', 'Clinical Implications of Hedgehog Pathway Signaling in Prostate Cancer.']"""

Methods:   Percutaneous MR-guided cryoablation was performed in 11 patients with prostatic adenocarcinoma contraindicated for surgery (mean age: 72 years, mean Gleason score: 6.45, mean prostate-specific antigen (PSA): 6.21 ng/ml, T1-2c/N0/M0, mean: prostate volume 36.44 ml). Free-hand probe positioning was performed under real-time MR imaging. Four to seven cryoprobes were inserted into the prostate, depending on gland volume. The ice ball was monitored using real-time and high-resolution BLADE multi-planar imaging. Patients were followed at 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after the procedure with serum PSA level and post-ablation MRI.  Results:   Prostate cryoablation was technically feasible in 10/11 patients. The ice ball was clearly and sharply visualised in all cases as a signal-void area. Mean ice-ball volume was 53.3 ml. Mean follow-up was 15 months (range: 1-25).

Patients received AA 1,000 mg orally once daily + prednisone 5 mg orally twice daily. Electrocardiograms (ECGs) were collected in triplicate using 12-lead Holter monitoring. Baseline ECGs were obtained on Cycle 1 Day-1. Serial ECG recordings and time-matched pharmacokinetic (PK) blood samples were collected over 24 h on Cycle 1 Day 1 and Cycle 2 Day 1. Serial PK blood samples were also collected over 24 h on Cycle 1 Day 8.  Results:   After AA administration, the upper bound of the 2-sided 90 % confidence interval (CI) for the mean baseline-adjusted QTcF change was <10 ms; no patients discontinued due to QTc prolongation or adverse events. No apparent relationship between change in QTcF and abiraterone plasma concentrations was observed [estimated slope (90 % CI): 0.0031 (-0.0040, 0.0102)].

The present study aimed to compare the short-term outcomes between robot-assisted intersphincteric resection (ISR) and laparoscopic ISR for distal rectal cancer.  Methods:   Patients who underwent robot- or laparoscopy-assisted ISR for rectal cancer between March 2008 and July 2011 were included in this retrospective comparative study. Perioperative and postoperative data, including complications and early functional outcomes, were analyzed between the two groups. Functional outcomes were evaluated using the Wexner scoring system, the International Prostate Symptom Score, and the 5-item version of the International Index of Erectile Function.  Results:   A total of 40 patients underwent robot-assisted and 40 underwent laparoscopic ISR. The mean operative time was significantly longer in the robotic group than in the laparoscopic group (235.5 vs. 185.4 min; p < 0.001). Transabdominal ISR, in which intersphincteric dissection is completed in the pelvic cavity, was performed more with robotic assistance than with laparoscopic surgery (8 vs. 2 cases; p = 0.043). No difference was observed between groups regarding postoperative morbidity and pathological outcomes. The robot-assisted group showed a trend toward less postoperative blood loss and early recovery of functional outcomes.  Conclusion:   Robot-assisted surgery was safe and effective for ISR of distal rectal cancer and showed surgical outcomes similar to those of the latest laparoscopic ISR. The favorable results of the robot-assisted ISR included reduced adaptation time, alleviated difficulty of perineal phase, and early recovery of functional outcomes in this analysis of short-term clinical outcomes.""","""['Soo Yeun Park', 'Gyu-Seog Choi', 'Jun Seok Park', 'Hye Jin Kim', 'Jong-Pil Ryuk']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Surg Endosc""","""['Comparison of the short-term efficacy of two types of robotic\xa0total mesorectal excision for rectal cancer.', 'Robot-assisted intersphincteric resection for low rectal cancer: technique and short-term outcome for 29 consecutive patients.', 'Robotic coloanal anastomosis with or without intersphincteric resection for low rectal cancer: starting with the perianal approach followed by robotic procedure.', 'Robotic resection compared with laparoscopic rectal resection for cancer: systematic review and meta-analysis of short-term outcome.', 'Delayed anastomotic leakage following laparoscopic intersphincteric resection for lower rectal cancer: report of four cases and literature review.', 'Possible Advantages of Minimal-Invasive Approaches in Rectal Cancer Surgery: A Nationwide Analysis.', 'The urinary and sexual outcomes of robot-assisted versus laparoscopic rectal cancer surgery: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Comparison of Non-Oncological Postoperative Outcomes Following Robotic and Laparoscopic Colorectal Resection for Colorectal Malignancy: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'Clinical efficacy of different approaches for laparoscopic intersphincteric resection of low rectal cancer: a comparison study.', 'Comparison of Clinical Efficacy and Safety Between da Vinci Robotic and Laparoscopic Intersphincteric Resection for Low Rectal Cancer: A Meta-Analysis.']"""

Methods:   Six patients were included per dose level. Following docetaxel infusion on day 1 (75 mg/m(2)/q3 weeks), sorafenib was administered at 200 mg BID on days 2-19 (dose level 1), at 200 mg BID on days 1-21 (dose level 2), at 400 mg BID on days 2-19 (dose level 3), at 400 mg BID on days 1-21 (dose level 4). Maximal tolerated dose (MTD) was exceeded if ≥2 patients experienced dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) during cycle 1. The recommended phase 2 dose for sorafenib was defined as one dose level below MTD. If MTD was not reached, the highest feasible dose would be selected to treat an expanded cohort to confirm safety.  Results:   Two DLTs were observed during sorafenib dose-escalation consisting of grade 4 febrile neutropenia (dose level 2) and grade 3 hand-foot syndrome (HFS) (dose level 3). Our pharmacokinetic results showed an increased exposure to docetaxel across all dose levels during sorafenib comedication. The main grade ≥3 toxicities were neutropenia (35 %), HFS (27 %), and febrile neutropenia (19 %). The prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response rate was 74 %. Median overall survival was 25.2 months.

MARCKS-like protein 1 (MARCKSL1) is widely expressed in nervous tissue, where, like Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK), it is required for neural tube formation, though the mechanism is unknown. Here we show that MARCKSL1 is directly phosphorylated by JNK on C-terminal residues (S120, T148, and T183). This phosphorylation enables MARCKSL1 to bundle and stabilize F-actin, increase filopodium numbers and dynamics, and retard migration in neurons. Conversely, when MARCKSL1 phosphorylation is inhibited, actin mobility increases and filopodium formation is compromised whereas lamellipodium formation is enhanced, as is cell migration. We find that MARCKSL1 mRNA is upregulated in a broad range of cancer types and that MARCKSL1 protein is strongly induced in primary prostate carcinomas. Gene knockdown in prostate cancer cells or in neurons reveals a critical role for MARCKSL1 in migration that is dependent on the phosphorylation state; phosphomimetic MARCKSL1 (MARCKSL1(S120D,T148D,T183D)) inhibits whereas dephospho-MARCKSL1(S120A,T148A,T183A) induces migration. In summary, these data show that JNK phosphorylation of MARCKSL1 regulates actin homeostasis, filopodium and lamellipodium formation, and neuronal migration under physiological conditions and that, when ectopically expressed in prostate cancer cells, MARCKSL1 again determines cell movement.""","""['Benny Björkblom', 'Artur Padzik', 'Hasan Mohammad', 'Nina Westerlund', 'Emilia Komulainen', 'Patrik Hollos', 'Lotta Parviainen', 'Anastassios C Papageorgiou', 'Kristiina Iljin', 'Olli Kallioniemi', 'Markku Kallajoki', 'Michael J Courtney', 'Mats Mågård', 'Peter James', 'Eleanor T Coffey']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Mol Cell Biol""","""['Yap promotes hepatocellular carcinoma metastasis and mobilization via governing cofilin/F-actin/lamellipodium axis by regulation of JNK/Bnip3/SERCA/CaMKII pathways.', 'MARCKS and MARCKS-like proteins in development and regeneration.', 'Paxillin is the target of c-Jun N-terminal kinase in Schwann cells and regulates migration.', 'Interaction of profilin-1 and F-actin via a β-arrestin-1/JNK signaling pathway involved in prostaglandin E(2)-induced human mesenchymal stem cells migration and proliferation.', 'Adducin is an in vivo substrate for protein kinase C: phosphorylation in the MARCKS-related domain inhibits activity in promoting spectrin-actin complexes and occurs in many cells, including dendritic spines of neurons.', 'Circulating extracellular vesicle-derived MARCKSL1 is a potential diagnostic non-invasive biomarker in metastatic colorectal cancer patients.', 'Integrated omics analysis reveals the epigenetic mechanism of visceral hypersensitivity in IBS-D.', 'circPLIN2 promotes clear cell renal cell carcinoma progression by binding IGF2BP proteins and miR-199a-3p.', 'MDFI is a novel biomarker for poor prognosis in LUAD.', 'The Role of MARCKS in Metastasis and Treatment Resistance of Solid Tumors.']"""

Aurora B kinase is known to play a critical role in mitosis. However, whether Aurora B is regulated by acetylation is not known. Using IP with an anti-acetyl lysine antibody, we identified Aurora B as an acetylated protein in PC3 prostate cancer cells. Knockdown of HDAC3 or inhibiting HDAC3 deacetylase activity led to a significant increase (P<0.01 and P<0.05, respectively) in Aurora B acetylation as compared to siLuc or vehicle-treated controls. Increased Aurora B acetylation is correlated with a 30% reduction in Aurora B kinase activity in vitro and resulted in significant defects in Aurora B-dependent mitotic processes, including kinetochore-microtubule attachment and chromosome congression. Furthermore, Aurora B transiently interacts with HDAC3 at the kinetochore-microtubule interface of congressing chromosomes during prometaphase. This window of interaction corresponded with a transient but significant reduction (P=0.02) in Aurora B acetylation during early mitosis. Together, these results indicate that Aurora B is more active in its deacetylated state and further suggest a new mechanism by which dynamic acetylation/deacetylation acts as a rheostat to fine-tune Aurora B activity during mitotic progression.""","""['Maria Fadri-Moskwik', 'Kimberly N Weiderhold', 'Arpaporn Deeraksa', 'Carol Chuang', 'Jing Pan', 'Sue-Hwa Lin', 'Li-Yuan Yu-Lee']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""FASEB J""","""['Inhibitors of histone deacetylases alter kinetochore assembly by disrupting pericentromeric heterochromatin.', 'Sds22 regulates aurora B activity and microtubule-kinetochore interactions at mitosis.', 'A novel histone deacetylase pathway regulates mitosis by modulating Aurora B kinase activity.', 'Regulation of kinetochore-microtubule attachments by Aurora B kinase.', 'Chromosome dynamics: new light on Aurora B kinase function.', 'USP48 Governs Cell Cycle Progression by Regulating the Protein Level of Aurora B.', 'Overexpression of PRC1 indicates a poor prognosis in ovarian cancer.', 'Haploinsufficient tumor suppressor Tip60 negatively regulates oncogenic Aurora B kinase.', 'Structural Characterization of the Aurora Kinase B ""DFG-flip"" Using Metadynamics.', 'Loss of HDAC3 contributes to meiotic defects in aged oocytes.']"""

Pulsed low dose rate (PLDR) external beam radiotherapy has the potential to reduce normal tissue toxicities while still providing significant tumor control for recurrent cancers. This work investigates the dosimetry feasibility of PLDR treatment using dynamic arc delivery techniques. Five treatment sites were investigated in this study including breast, pancreas, prostate, head and neck, and lung. Dynamic arc plans were generated using the Varian Eclipse system and the RapidArc delivery technique with 6 and 10 MV photon beams. Each RapidArc plan consisted of two full arcs and the plan was delivered five times to achieve a daily dose of 200 cGy. The dosimetry requirement was to deliver approximately 20 cGy/arc with a 3 min interval to achieve an effective dose rate of 6.7 cGy min⁻¹. Monte Carlo simulations were performed to calculate the actual dose delivered to the planning target volume (PTV) per arc taking into account beam attenuation/scattering and intensity modulation. The maximum, minimum and mean doses to the PTV were analyzed together with the dose volume histograms and isodose distributions. The dose delivery for the five plans was validated using solid water phantoms inserted with an ionization chamber and film, and a cylindrical detector array. Two intensity-modulated arcs were used to efficiently deliver the PLDR plans that provided conformal dose distributions for treating complex recurrent cancers. For the five treatment sites, the mean PTV dose ranged from 18.9 to 22.6 cGy/arc. For breast, the minimum and maximum PTV dose was 8.3 and 35.2 cGy/arc, respectively. The PTV dose varied between 12.9 and 27.5 cGy/arc for pancreas, 12.6 and 28.3 cGy/arc for prostate, 12.1 and 30.4 cGy/arc for H&N, and 16.2 and 27.6 cGy/arc for lung.

Among the metachronous pancreatic cancer patients, the disease-free interval was 88.3 months in the MCP group, and 49.6 months in the DPPC group (P=0.062). The number of the patients who showed elevated CA 19-9 levels was higher in the DPPC group than in the MCP group (39 (65%) vs. 9 (26.5%); P=0.001). Total bilirubin (P=0.006) and fasting plasma glucose (P=0.050) were also higher in the DPPC group. The numbers of patients who showed pancreatic duct dilatation (P=0.002) and pancreatic atrophy (P=0.008) on radiographs were meaningfully higher in the DPPC group than in the MCP group. On the other hand, the numbers of patients who showed well demarcated tumor margin (P<0.000), tumor necrosis (P=0.002), enhancement (P=0.005) and distant metastasis (P=0.028) were significantly higher in the MCP group than in the DPPC group. We evaluated differences in survival between the two groups. The median survival time in the MCP group (55 months) was significantly longer than that in the DPPC group (20 months).  Conclusions:   Other than elevated levels of CA 19-9, total bilirubin and fasting glucose, radiologic findings were the most reliable factors for distinguishing the MCP from the DPPC.""","""['Hwan Sic Yun', 'Yang Won Min', 'Min Ji Lee', 'Woo Ik Chang', 'Kwang Hyuck Lee', 'Kyu Taek Lee', 'Jong Kyun Lee', 'Young Kon Kim', 'Jae Hoon Lim']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Clin Res Hepatol Gastroenterol""","""['Resection or cryosurgery relates with pancreatic tumor type: primary pancreatic cancer with previous non-pancreatic cancer or secondary metastatic cancer within the pancreas.', 'MDCT findings of pancreatic metastases according to primary tumors.', 'Synchronous or metachronous double cancers of the pancreas and other organs: report on 12 cases.', 'Pancreatic resection for metastatic tumors to the pancreas.', 'Spontaneous change of malignancy of solid malignant tumors : statistical investigations of colorectal and pancreatic carcinoma.', 'Synchronous Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma in the Head and Tail, a Double Trouble: A Case Report and Literature Review.', 'Laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy for metastatic pancreatic melanoma: A case report.', 'Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration cytology of metastatic renal cell carcinoma to the pancreas: A multi-center experience.']"""

This study determined whether SPC was a viable technique for evaluating the proper operation of a high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy treatment delivery system.  Methods and materials:   A surrogate prostate patient was developed using Vyse ordnance gelatin. A total of 10 metal oxide semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) were placed from prostate base to apex. Computed tomography guidance was used to accurately position the first detector in each train at the base. The plan consisted of 12 needles with 129 dwell positions delivering a prescribed peripheral dose of 200 cGy. Sixteen accurate treatment trials were delivered as planned. Subsequently, a number of treatments were delivered with errors introduced, including wrong patient, wrong source calibration, wrong connection sequence, single needle displaced inferiorly 5 mm, and entire implant displaced 2 mm and 4 mm inferiorly. Two process behavior charts (PBC), an individual and a moving range chart, were developed for each dosimeter location.  Results:   There were 4 false positives resulting from 160 measurements from 16 accurately delivered treatments. For the inaccurately delivered treatments, the PBC indicated that measurements made at the periphery and apex (regions of high-dose gradient) were much more sensitive to treatment delivery errors. All errors introduced were correctly identified by either the individual or the moving range PBC in the apex region. Measurements at the urethra and base were less sensitive to errors.  Conclusions:   SPC is a viable method for assessing the quality of HDR treatment delivery. Further development is necessary to determine the most effective dose sampling, to ensure reproducible evaluation of treatment delivery accuracy.""","""['Charles M Able', 'Megan Bright', 'Bart Frizzell']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Identifying afterloading PDR and HDR brachytherapy errors using real-time fiber-coupled Al(2)O(3):C dosimetry and a novel statistical error decision criterion.', 'A new model using number of needles and androgen deprivation to predict chronic urinary toxicity for high or low dose rate prostate brachytherapy.', 'Acute genitourinary toxicity after high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy combined with hypofractionated external-beam radiation therapy for localized prostate cancer: correlation between the urethral dose in HDR brachytherapy and the severity of acute genitourinary toxicity.', 'High dose rate brachytherapy: its clinical applications and treatment guidelines.', 'Statistical process control: separating signal from noise in emergency department operations.', 'Control charts for evaluation of quality of low-dose-rate brachytherapy for prostate cancer.', 'Image registration assessment in radiotherapy image guidance based on control chart monitoring.', 'In vivo dosimetry: trends and prospects for brachytherapy.', 'Physics-aspects of dose accuracy in high dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy: source dosimetry, treatment planning, equipment performance and in vivo verification techniques.', 'Initial investigation using statistical process control for quality control of accelerator beam steering.']"""

Methods:   Men with favorable and intermediate-risk prostate cancer were assigned to receive prostate intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) versus an erectile tissue-sparing IMRT technique in a Phase III randomized, prospective study. The stamp test and International Index of Erectile Function and Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite questionnaires were completed at baseline and 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years after IMRT. The Sexual Health Inventory for Men scores were abstracted from the International Index of Erectile Function questionnaire. A partner questionnaire, designated IIEF-P, modeled after the International Index of Erectile Function questionnaire but from the perspective of the partner, was also collected.  Results:   The data from 94 men who were enrolled in the trial and who had completed ≥1 questionnaire or 1 stamp test were analyzed. The median age of the patient population was 62.5 years. The median radiation dose was 76 Gy (range 74-80). At 6 months and 1 year after high-dose IMRT, a positive stamp result correlated significantly with the median Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite sexual summary, sexual function, and bother subscale scores. Additionally, 6 months after IMRT, the stamp test correlated with the median International Index of Erectile Function, International Index of Erectile Function sexual function domain, and Sexual Health Inventory for Men scores. Robust concordance for the International Index of Erectile Function and Sexual Health Inventory for Men scores was appreciated between responding patient and partner pairs.  Conclusion:   Nocturnal tumescence, as indicated by a positive stamp test, correlated well with established quality of life questionnaires after IMRT. The stamp test should strongly be considered as an objective measure of erectile function in future studies of erectile dysfunction in patients with prostate cancer.""","""['Lanea M M Keller', 'Mark K Buyyounouski', 'Dennis Sopka', 'Karen Ruth', 'Tracy Klayton', 'Alan Pollack', 'Deborah Watkins-Bruner', 'Richard Greenberg', 'Robert Price', 'Eric M Horwitz']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Urology""","""['Long-Term Results of a Phase 3 Randomized Prospective Trial of Erectile Tissue-Sparing Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy for Men With Clinically Localized Prostate Cancer.', 'The Effects of Focal Therapy for Prostate Cancer on Sexual Function: A Combined Analysis of Three Prospective Trials.', 'Preliminary patient-reported outcomes analysis of 3-dimensional radiation therapy versus intensity-modulated radiation therapy on the high-dose arm of the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) 0126 prostate cancer trial.', 'Detailing Sexual Outcomes After Focal Therapy for Localised Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'Exercise therapy for sexual dysfunction after prostate cancer.', 'Baseline status and dose to the penile bulb predict impotence 1\xa0year after radiotherapy for prostate cancer.', 'Patient-reported sexual toxicity after radiation therapy in long-term prostate cancer survivors.']"""

The approach is used to explore how time series of annual county-level proportions of late-stage prostate cancer diagnosis differ across Florida. The state-average proportion of late-stage diagnosis decreased 50% since 1981. This drop started in the early 1990s when prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test became widely available and several parts of Florida underwent fast urbanization.

In this paper, a combined model is proposed: an alternative convolution model accounting for both overdispersion and spatial correlation in the data by combining the Poisson-gamma model with a spatially-structured normal CAR random effect. The Limburg Cancer Registry data on kidney and prostate cancer in Limburg were used to compare the conventional and new models. A simulation study confirmed results and interpretations coming from the real datasets.

Patients receiving leuprolide could receive antiandrogens for flare protection. Treatment effects on testosterone and PSA reduction, testosterone surge, and microsurges were investigated in 3 baseline testosterone subgroups: <3.5, 3.5-5.0, and >5.0 ng/mL. Data are presented for the groups receiving degarelix 240/80 mg (the approved dose) and leuprolide 7.5 mg.  Results:   Higher baseline testosterone delayed castration with both treatments. However, castrate testosterone levels and PSA suppression occurred more rapidly with degarelix irrespective of baseline testosterone. With leuprolide, the magnitude of testosterone surge and microsurges increased with increasing baseline testosterone. There was no overall correlation between baseline testosterone and initial PSA decrease in either treatment group, although PSA suppression tended to be slowest with leuprolide and fastest with degarelix in the high baseline testosterone subgroup.  Conclusion:   Patients with high baseline testosterone may have greater risk of tumor stimulation (clinical flare) and mini-flares during gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonist treatment and so the need for flare protection with antiandrogens in these patients is obvious, especially in metastatic disease.

Compounds were then compared with doxorubicin, a clinically used anticancer compound for breast and prostate cancers. Our most active compound 3d is more effective than doxorubicin at the dose level of 10 μm at 3 days after radiation, cell viabilities of 18%, 13% compared to 87%, 94% against MCF-7, and 15%, 20% compared to 60%, 75% against DU-145 without and with radiation, respectively. At 10 μm, compound 5c had no effects as compared to control, whereas compound 3d reduced DU-145 cell viability to 16% and that of MCF-7 cells to 9% even at 5 days after radiation.

In the present study, we investigated the effect of ATP on the cytotoxicity of doxorubicin in various cancer cell types and found that ATP had no effect on doxorubicin cytotoxicity in colon, prostate, breast, and cervical cancers or in osteosarcoma. In contrast, ATP has divergent effects on lung cancer cells: it can protect against doxorubicin-induced cell death in non-metastatic lung cancer CL1.0 cells, but not in highly metastatic CL1.5 cells. Both apoptotic (characterized by sub-G(1) peak, caspase 3 activation, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 cleavage) and necrotic (characterized by propidium iodide uptake and ROS production) features induced by doxorubicin in CL1.0 cells were reduced by ATP. In addition, ATP attenuated p53 accumulation, DNA damage (assessed by poly(ADP-ribose) formation and the comet assay) and topoisomerase II inhibition after doxorubicin treatment, and doxorubicin cytotoxicity was diminished by the p53 inhibitor pifithrin-α. Moreover, UTP, UDP, ADP, and pyrophosphate sodium pyrophosphate tetrabasic decahydrate diminished the antitumor effect of doxorubicin in CL1.0 cells, whereas purinergic P2 receptors antagonists did not abrogate the action of ATP. In summary, ATP fails to alter the antitumor efficacy of doxorubicin in most cancer cell types, except in CL1.0 cells, in which pyrophosphate mediates the cell protection afforded by ATP via attenuation of reactive oxygen species production, DNA damage, p53 accumulation, and caspase activation.""","""['Jang-Shiun Wang', 'Yeo-Loo Chang', 'Yang-Hao Yu', 'Chih-Yi Chen', 'Ming-Ching Kao', 'Tsai-Kun Li', 'Wan-Wan Lin']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Cancer Sci""","""['Pro-apoptotic activity of new analog of anthracyclines--WP 631 in advanced ovarian cancer cell line.', 'Interferon-alpha enhances sensitivity of human osteosarcoma U2OS cells to doxorubicin by p53-dependent apoptosis.', 'Adenosine uptake is the major effector of extracellular ATP toxicity in human cervical cancer cells.', ""Cell death induced by uridine 5'-triphosphate (UTP) in contrast to adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) in human epidermoid carcinoma cells (A-431)."", 'Extracellular ATP and adenosine induce cell apoptosis of human hepatoma Li-7A cells via the A3 adenosine receptor.', 'Extracellular ATP protects endothelial cells against DNA damage.']"""

Material and methods:   A prospective randomized controlled trial was conducted at St. Olavs Hospital, Trondheim University Hospital, Norway. Eighty-five men were randomized into two intervention groups (A and B). patients in group A (n = 42) were offered physiotherapist-guided PFMT (in groups or by DVD) once weekly throughout the first 12 months after RP, while those in group B (n = 43) trained on their own. HRQoL data were assessed using the University of California, Los Angeles Prostate Cancer Index (UCLA-PCI) and the Short Form-12 (SF-12) health survey. The physical component summary (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS) scores of the SF-12 plus the urinary, sexual and bowel function and bother of the UCLA-PCI make up the eight quality of life outcomes used in this study.

Results:   Eighty patients completed at least one follow-up assessment, 38 in group A and 42 in group B, giving a dropout rate of 5.9%. The overall response rates were 96% at baseline, 83% at 6 weeks, 90% at 3 months, 88% at 6 months and 68% at 12 months.

A cholesterol-sensitive gene expression network was constructed from these data and the transcription factor ATF3 was identified as a prominent node in the network. Validation experiments confirmed that elevated cholesterol reduced ATF3 expression and enhanced proliferation of prostate cells, while cholesterol depletion increased ATF3 levels and inhibited proliferation. Cholesterol reduction in vivo alleviated dense lymphomononuclear infiltrates in the periprostatic adipose tissue, which were closely associated with nerve tracts and blood vessels.

In particular, a highly lipogenic phenotype is a hallmark of many tumor types, including prostate. Cancer cells also have increased turnover of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+)), a coenzyme involved in multiple metabolic pathways. However, a specific role for NAD(+) in tumor cell lipogenesis has yet to be described. Our studies demonstrate a novel role for the NAD(+)-biosynthetic enzyme Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (Nampt) in maintaining de novo lipogenesis in prostate cancer (PCa) cells. Inhibition of Nampt reduces fatty acid and phospholipid synthesis. In particular, short chain saturated fatty acids and the phosphatidylcholine (PC) lipids into which these fatty acids are incorporated were specifically reduced by Nampt inhibition. Nampt blockade resulted in reduced ATP levels and concomitant activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and phosphorylation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC). In spite of this, pharmacological inhibition of AMPK was not sufficient to fully restore fatty acid synthesis. Rather, Nampt blockade also induced protein hyperacetylation in PC-3, DU145, and LNCaP cells, which correlated with the observed decreases in lipid synthesis. Moreover, the sirtuin inhibitor Sirtinol, and the simultaneous knockdown of SIRT1 and SIRT3, phenocopied the effects of Nampt inhibition on fatty acid synthesis. Altogether, these data reveal a novel role for Nampt in the regulation of de novo lipogenesis through the modulation of sirtuin activity in PCa cells.""","""['Sarah C Bowlby', 'Michael J Thomas', ""Ralph B D'Agostino Jr"", 'Steven J Kridel']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Inhibition of NAMPT aggravates high fat diet-induced hepatic steatosis in mice through regulating Sirt1/AMPKα/SREBP1 signaling pathway.', 'Both gain and loss of Nampt function promote pressure overload-induced heart failure.', 'FK866-induced NAMPT inhibition activates AMPK and downregulates mTOR signaling in hepatocarcinoma cells.', 'Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (Nampt) in carcinogenesis: new clinical opportunities.', 'Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) inhibitors as therapeutics: rationales, controversies, clinical experience.', 'Neuromuscular electrical stimulation enhances the ability of serum extracellular vesicles to regenerate aged skeletal muscle after injury.', 'Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Inhibition Leads to Decreased Glycolysis, Increased Reliance on Gluconeogenesis and Alternative Sources of Acetyl-CoA in Acute Myeloid Leukemia.', 'Integrating Pharmacogenomics Data-Driven Computational Drug Prediction with Single-Cell RNAseq to Demonstrate the Efficacy of a NAMPT Inhibitor against Aggressive, Taxane-Resistant, and Stem-like Cells in Lethal Prostate Cancer.', 'Different Effects of RNAi-Mediated Downregulation or Chemical Inhibition of NAMPT in an Isogenic IDH Mutant and Wild-Type Glioma Cell Model.', 'Nicotinamide (niacin) supplement increases lipid metabolism and ROS-induced energy disruption in triple-negative breast cancer: potential for drug repositioning as an anti-tumor agent.']"""

Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in men. Unlike other major types of cancer, no single gene has been identified as being mutated in the majority of prostate tumors. This implies that the expression profiling of genes, including the non-coding miRNAs, may substantially vary across individual cases of this cancer. The within-class variability makes it possible to reconstruct or infer disease-specific miRNA-mRNA correlation and regulatory modular networks using high-dimensional microarray data of prostate tumor samples. Furthermore, since miRNAs and tumor suppressor genes are usually tissue specific, miRNA-mRNA modules could potentially differ between primary prostate cancer (PPC) and metastatic prostate cancer (MPC). We herein performed an in silico analysis to explore the miRNA-mRNA correlation network modules in the two tumor subtypes. Our analysis identified 5 miRNA-mRNA module pairs (MPs) for PPC and MPC, respectively. Each MP includes one positive-connection (correlation) module and one negative-connection (correlation) module. The number of miRNAs or mRNAs (genes) in each module varies from 2 to 8 or from 6 to 622. The modules discovered for PPC are more informative than those for MPC in terms of the implicated biological insights. In particular, one negative-connection module in PPC fits well with the popularly recognized miRNA-mediated post-transcriptional regulation theory. That is, the 3'UTR sequences of the involved mRNAs (∼620) are enriched with the target site motifs of the 7 modular miRNAs, has-miR-106b, -191, -19b, -92a, -92b, -93, and -141. About 330 GO terms and KEGG pathways, including TGF-beta signaling pathway that maintains tissue homeostasis and plays a crucial role in the suppression of the proliferation of cancer cells, are over-represented (adj.p<0.05) in the modular gene list.

Studies were conducted on PTX resistant DU145-TXR and PC3-TXR cell lines and clinical prostate tissues. Drug sensitivity and apoptosis assays showed significantly improved cytotoxicity with combination of PTX and CYA. To distinguish the presence of cancer stem cell like side populations (SP), Hoechst 33342 flow cytometry method was used. PTX resistant DU145 and PC3 cells, as well as human prostate cancer tissue possess a distinct SP fraction. Nearly 75% of the SP cells are in the G0/G1 phase compared to 62% for non-SP cells and have higher expression of stem cell markers as well. SP cell fraction was increased following PTX monotherapy and treatment with CYA or CYA plus PTX effectively reduced their numbers suggesting the effectiveness of combination therapy. SP fraction cells were allowed to differentiate and reanalyzed by Hoechst staining and gene expression analysis. Post differentiation, SP cells constitute 15.8% of total viable cells which decreases to 0.6% on treatment with CYA. The expression levels of P-gp efflux protein were also significantly decreased on treatment with PTX and CYA combination. MicroRNA profiling of DU145-TXR and PC3-TXR cells and prostate cancer tissue from the patients showed decreased expression of tumor suppressor miRNAs such as miR34a and miR200c. Treatment with PTX and CYA combination restored the expression of miR200c and 34a, confirming their role in modulating chemoresistance.

Patients and methods:   Patients received escalating doses of intravenous TRC105 until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity using a standard 3 + 3 phase I design.  Results:   Fifty patients were treated with escalating doses of TRC105. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was exceeded at 15 mg/kg every week because of dose-limiting hypoproliferative anemia. TRC105 exposure increased with increasing dose, and continuous serum concentrations that saturate CD105 receptors were maintained at 10 mg/kg weekly (the MTD) and 15 mg/kg every 2 weeks. Common adverse events including anemia, telangiectasias, and infusion reactions reflected the mechanism of action of the drug. Antibodies to TRC105 were not detected in patients treated with TRC105 from Chinese hamster ovary cells being used in ongoing phase Ib and phase II studies. Stable disease or better was achieved in 21 of 45 evaluable patients (47%), including two ongoing responses at 48 and 18 months.

This work was done to develop a practical picture of the magnitude of these changes. We used Varian's Eclipse Treatment Planning System to calculate the number of MUs and beam-on times for a total of 40 different treatment plans across an array of common IMRT sites including prostate/pelvis, prostate bed, head and neck, and central nervous system cancers using dose rates of 300, 400 and 600 MU/min. In general, we observed a 4%-7% increase in the number of MUs delivered and a 10-40 second decrease in the beam-on time for each 100 MU/min of dose rate increase. The increase in the number of MUs resulted in a reduction of the ""beam-on time saved"". The exact magnitude of the changes depended on treatment site and planning target volume. These changes can lead to minor, but not negligible, concerns with respect to radiation protection and treatment planning. Although the number of MUs increased more rapidly for more complex treatment plans, the absolute beam-on time savings was greater for these plans because of the higher total number of MUs required to deliver them. We estimate that increasing the IMRT dose rate from 300 to 600 MU/min has the potential to add up to two treatment slots per day for each IMRT linear accelerator. These results will be of value to anyone considering general changes to IMRT dose rates within their clinic.""","""['E Ghasroddashti', 'W L Smith', 'S Quirk', 'C Kirkby']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""J Appl Clin Med Phys""","""['Interplay effect on a 6-MV flattening-filter-free linear accelerator with high dose rate and fast multi-leaf collimator motion treating breast and lung phantoms.', 'Rotational IMRT techniques compared to fixed gantry IMRT and tomotherapy: multi-institutional planning study for head-and-neck cases.', 'Major reduction of monitor units with the avoidance of leaf-sequencing step by direct aperture based IMRT optimisation.', 'Effects of organ motion on IMRT treatments with segments of few monitor units.', 'The potential for sparing of parotids and escalation of biologically effective dose with intensity-modulated radiation treatments of head and neck cancers: a treatment design study.', 'Comparison of Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy Treatment Plans Between 1.5T MR-Linac and Conventional Linac.', 'Empirical Driven Automatic Detection of Lobulation Imaging Signs in Lung CT.', 'Single arc volumetric-modulated arc therapy is sufficient for nasopharyngeal carcinoma: a dosimetric comparison with dual arc VMAT and dynamic MLC and step-and-shoot intensity-modulated radiotherapy.']"""

The protocol acquires two CBCT scans with a couch shift similar to the ""step-and-shoot"" cine CT acquisition, allowing a small longitudinal overlap of the two reconstructed volumes. An in-house DICOM reading/writing software was developed to combine the two image sets into one. Three different approaches were explored to handle the possible misalignment between the two image subsets: simple stacking, averaging the overlapped volumes, and a 3D-3D image registration with the three translational degrees of freedom. Using thermoluminescent dosimeters and custom-designed holders for a CTDI phantom set, dose measurements were carried out to assess the resultant imaging dose of the technique and its geometric distribution.

However, to confirm this, PAX2p-null SCOUTs must be precisely quantified relative to the epithelial surface. We developed a method by which fallopian tube sections were digitized using an iScan brightfield scanner (BioImagene) and uploaded in Adobe Photoshop CS3 Extended. Pixel length was translated into microns and epithelial length measured with the Magic Wand tool. SCOUTs were expressed as a function of total epithelial perimeter. Frequency, required perimeter length, topographic clustering tendency and effects of age were ascertained. SCOUT frequency per 10 cm was 0-4.60 for cases and 0-1.66 for controls, averaging 0.84 and 0.27, respectively, (P=0.007). Required perimeter length for SCOUT detection was less in serous cancer cases and topographic distribution followed a random pattern without aberrant clustering. Age was also associated with SCOUT frequency (P=0.025) and differences between cancers and controls were still significant after adjusting for age (P=0.001).

Immunoreactivity was graded for extent and intensity of positive tumor cell nuclei. ERG labeling was seen in 7/8 EWSR1-ERG cases (predominantly diffuse (5+), moderate to strong), while only 3/24 non-EWR1-ERG cases showed labeling (very weak). FLI1 labeling was observed in 29/31 cases regardless of fusion variant; 23 displayed diffuse (5+) strong/moderate labeling (5/7 EWSR1-ERG, 18/22 EWSR1-FLI1).

However, this feature of prostate cells is lost during carcinogenesis and, thus, prostate cells are unable to accumulate zinc(II) ions in high levels. Therefore, we can expect that zinc(II) ions can significantly contribute to the progression of tumour disease and to the ability of prostate cell lines to metastasize. In this study, we aimed our attention on determining the expression of Bcl-2, c-Fos, c-Jun, Ki-67, NF-κB and p53 genes in two prostate cell lines, as the 22Rv1 cell line, a model of aggressive partially androgen-sensitive prostate cancer and the PNT1A cell line, a normal prostate cell line model. Moreover, we were interested in the mechanisms through which exposure of these cell lines to zinc(II) ions could influence expression of the above-mentioned genes. We found that zinc(II) ions caused elevated expression of Ki-67, a marker of proliferation, extremely low expression of p53, high expression of Bcl-2 and no changes in the expression of p53.

A number of observations suggest that JNK-1 is a growth promoting factor in prostate cancer cells and blocking its function may induce apoptosis. To test this further, we used a small interfering RNA (siRNA) against JNK-1 mRNA that efficiently inhibits JNK-1 expression in the prostate cancer cell line, PC-3. The application of siRNA against JNK-1 decreased the expression of JNK-1 and affected the expression of p21, XIAP and Bcl-2, but had no effect on the expression of VEGF. In contrast, a control scramble siRNA did not affect the expression of the above indicated proteins. The downregulation of JNK-1 expression at both the mRNA and protein levels was detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and western blot analysis. Cell proliferation inhibition rates were determined by the MTT assay. The effect of JNK-1-siRNA on cell cycle distribution and cell apoptosis was determined by flow cytometry, DNA fragmentation and caspase activity. Our data showed that siRNA against JNK-1 mRNA, could efficiently suppress the expression of JNK-1 in PC-3 cells. After 5 days of transfection, the cell death rate was 52%, the apoptotic rate 26% and the viability rate 22%. In conclusion, downregulation of JNK-1 expression by siRNA against JNK-1 mRNA induces apoptotic signaling in prostate cancer PC-3 cells.

H3K27me3 is characteristic of the chromatin at genes involved in developmental regulation in undifferentiated cells. Overexpression of EZH2 has been found in several cancer types such as breast, prostate, melanoma and bladder cancer. Moreover, overexpression is associated with highly proliferative and aggressive types of breast and prostate tumors. We have analyzed the abundance of EZH2 and H3K27me3 using immunohistochemistry in two large and well-characterized breast tumor data sets encompassing more than 400 tumors. The results have been analyzed in relation to the molecular subtypes of breast tumors (basal-like, luminal A, luminal B, HER2-enriched and normal-like), as well as in subtypes defined by clinical markers (triple negative, ER+/HER2-/Ki67low, ER+/HER2-/Ki67high and HER2+), and were validated in representative breast cancer cell lines by western blot. We found significantly different expression of both EZH2 and H3K27me3 across all subtypes with high abundance of EZH2 in basal-like, triple negative and HER2-enriched tumors, and high H3K27me3 in luminal A, HER2-enriched and normal-like tumors. Intriguingly, the two markers show an inverse correlation, particularly for the basal-like and triple negative tumors. Consequently, high expression of EZH2 was associated with poor distant disease-free survival whereas high expression of H3K27me3 was associated with better survival. Additionally, none of 182 breast tumors was found to carry a previously described EZH2 mutation affecting Tyr641. Our observation that increased expression of EZH2 does not necessarily correlate with increased abundance of H3K27me3 supports the idea that EZH2 can have effects beyond epigenetic silencing of target genes in breast cancer.""","""['Karolina Holm', 'Dorthe Grabau', 'Kristina Lövgren', 'Steina Aradottir', 'Sofia Gruvberger-Saal', 'Jillian Howlin', 'Lao H Saal', 'Stephen P Ethier', 'Pär-Ola Bendahl', 'Olle Stål', 'Per Malmström', 'Mårten Fernö', 'Lisa Rydén', 'Cecilia Hegardt', 'Åke Borg', 'Markus Ringnér']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Mol Oncol""","""['The methyltransferase EZH2 is not required for mammary cancer development, although high EZH2 and low H3K27me3 correlate with poor prognosis of ER-positive breast cancers.', 'EZH2 overexpression in different immunophenotypes of breast carcinoma and association with clinicopathologic features.', 'Poorly differentiated synovial sarcoma is associated with high expression of enhancer of zeste homologue 2 (EZH2).', 'EZH2 methyltransferase and H3K27 methylation in breast cancer.', 'The noncanonical role of EZH2 in cancer.', 'PIC recruitment by synthetic reader-actuators to polycomb-silenced genes blocks triple-negative breast cancer invasion.', 'Polycomb deficiency drives a FOXP2-high aggressive state targetable by epigenetic inhibitors.', 'EZH2-H3K27me3 mediated KRT14 upregulation promotes TNBC peritoneal metastasis.', 'H3K27me3 in Diffuse Midline Glioma and Epithelial Ovarian Cancer: Opposing Epigenetic Changes Leading to the Same Poor Outcomes.', 'Histone modification and histone modification-targeted anti-cancer drugs in breast cancer: Fundamentals and beyond.']"""

There are conflicting data regarding the role of COX-2 in the progression of this disease. Here we examined the expression of VIP receptors (VPAC1 and VPAC2) and COX-2 in prostate cancer specimens. Correlations among protein levels and various clinicopathological factors and prognosis of patients were statistically analyzed. For these purposes, formaldehyde-fixed, paraffin-embedded prostate tissue specimens from 63 patients with prostate cancer and 9 control samples were used. The expression of VPAC1 and VPAC2 receptors and COX-2 was analyzed at mRNA levels by quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR. The corresponding expression at protein level was studied by immunohistochemistry, scored as negative, weak, moderate, or strong, and correlated with different clinicopathological factors by means of multivariate analysis. 88% of prostate cancer tissues overexpressed VPAC1-receptor at mRNA level, 72% VPAC2-receptor and 77% COX-2. Simultaneous overexpression of the three genes was seen in 52% of patients. Similar overexpression patterns were observed at protein level. The correlation between VPAC1 and VPAC2 receptor protein levels was statistically significant. However, no significant correlations existed among protein levels of VPAC receptors and COX-2 with patient age, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, tumor stage, Gleason score and survival time. The overexpression of VPAC1 and VPAC2 receptors and COX-2 in cancer tissue gives them a potential role as targets for diagnosis of prostate cancer but results do not support a clear value as biomarkers for the clinical prognosis of this disease.""","""['Ana B Fernández-Martínez', 'María J Carmena', 'M Isabel Arenas', 'Ana M Bajo', 'Juan C Prieto', 'Manuel Sánchez-Chapado']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Histol Histopathol""","""['Gene expression of vasoactive intestinal peptide receptors in human lung cancer.', 'Alterations in the relative abundance of the vasoactive intestinal peptide receptors (VPAC1 and VPAC2) and functions in uterine contractility during inflammation.', 'Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide/vasoactive intestinal peptide receptors in human normal mammary gland and breast cancer tissue.', 'VPAC receptors: structure, molecular pharmacology and interaction with accessory proteins.', 'VPAC1-targeted PET/CT scan: improved molecular imaging for the diagnosis of prostate cancer using a novel cell surface antigen.', 'VIPR1 promoter methylation promotes transcription factor AP-2α binding to inhibit VIPR1 expression and promote hepatocellular carcinoma cell growth in vitro.', 'Colorectal Cancer Early Detection in Stool Samples Tracing CpG Islands Methylation Alterations Affecting Gene Expression.', 'ADRB2-Targeting Therapies for Prostate Cancer.', 'VPAC1 couples with TRPV4 channel to promote calcium-dependent gastric cancer progression via a novel autocrine mechanism.', 'Establishment of a 12-gene expression signature to predict colon cancer prognosis.']"""

Methods:   Preoperative sex hormone serum levels were prospectively measured in 137 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy at the University Hospital Ulm from February 2011 to February 2012. We related sex hormone levels to clinicopathologic data including tumour stage, Gleason score and prostate specific antigen (PSA). (Non)parametric statistical tests and receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analyses were performed.  Results:   Preoperative serum fT levels were significantly associated with advanced disease (pT3-4 and/or pN+; p = 0.047) and lymph node involvement (pN+) (p = 0.027). Patients with low (<0.047 μg/l) vs. normal fT values (≥0.047 μg/l) were associated with higher tumour stage (p = 0.049), positive lymph node status (pN+ , p = 0.038) and advance disease (p = 0.016). Moreover, low tT values (≤0.193 μg/l; p = 0.018) and elevated SHBG levels (>48.4 nmol/l, p = 0.043) correlated with a higher Gleason score. Conversely, E2 levels were not associated with tumour stage or grade. Applying multivariate analysis, unlike tT, SHBG, and E2 levels, low fT levels were a significant independent predictor of advanced disease (relative hazard ratio 3.05, p = 0.028).

Participants in this study included 2499 prostate cancer survivors from the Michigan Cancer Registry from 1985 to 2004. Participants completed surveys regarding health-seeking behavior, post-treatment symptoms, quality of care and recurrence. Ethnicity was self-reported and AAs and CAs were compared with respect to clinical profile, quality of care, and recurrence. There were 52 AAs and 1886 CAs patients with AAs being younger ([Formula: see text] age 68.3 ± SD 21.4 years, [Formula: see text] age 72.3 ± SD 14.1 years, for AAs and CAs, respectively) (P = 0.05). AAs had lower socioeconomic standard than CAs (34 vs. 10.6 %, <$20,000 yearly income/year; for AAs vs. CAs, respectively) (P < 0.0001). AAs reported poorer health than AAs (7.7 vs. 3.0 % for AAs vs. CAs, respectively) (P < 0.0001). AAs were more likely to visit specialists for prostate follow-up (44.5 vs. 19.7 % visited a specialist, for AAs vs. CAs respectively) (P < 0.0001) and received supplementary healthcare workers (13 % of AAs vs. 3.1 % CAs) (P = 0.032).

This study examined the outcome for high-risk localized PCa patients treated with RP.  Material and methods:   Of 1300 patients who underwent RP, 231 were identified as high-risk. Patients were followed for biochemical recurrence (BCR) (defined as prostate-specific antigen ≥ 0.2 ng/ml), metastatic disease and survival. Excluding node-positive patients, none of the patients received adjuvant therapy before BCR was confirmed. Univariate and multivariate analysis was performed with Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazard models.  Results:   Median follow-up was 4.4 years (range:0.1-14.9). The estimated 10-year biochemical recurrence-free survival was 49%, 10-year metastasis-free survival was 81%, 10-year overall survival was 84% and estimated cause-specific survival after 10 years was 90%. In multivariate analysis extracapsular extension, seminal vesicle invasion and young age were significant predictors of BCR.  Conclusion:   The results confirm that a significant proportion of patients with high-risk PCa remain biochemically diseasefree and without a need for ET following RP as the primary and only treatment.

AIM1, ERGIC1, and TPX2 were shown to be highly expressed especially in prostate cancer tissues, and high mRNA expression of ERGIC1 and TMED3 associated with AR and ERG oncogene expression. ERGIC1 silencing specifically regulated the proliferation of ERG oncogene positive prostate cancer cells and inhibited ERG mRNA expression in these cells, indicating that it is a potent drug target in ERG positive subgroup of prostate cancers. TPX2 expression associated with PSA failure and TPX2 silencing reduced PSA expression, indicating that TPX2 regulates androgen receptor mediated signaling.

Cells were treated with 1-50 µg/ml LDL-cholesterol and/or 100 nM simvastatin for seven days. Cell number relative to control was measured with crystal violet staining. Changes in mRNA and protein expression of key effectors in cholesterol metabolism (HMGCR, LDLR, SREBP2 and ABCA1) were measured with RT-PCR and immunoblotting, respectively. LDL increased the relative cell number of prostate cancer cell lines, but reduced the number of normal epithelial cells at high concentrations. Treatment with cholesterol-lowering simvastatin induced up to 90% reduction in relative cell number of normal cell lines but a 15-20% reduction in relative number of cancer cells, an effect accompanied by sharp upregulation of HMGCR and LDLR. These effects were prevented by LDL. Compared to the normal cells, prostate cancer cells showed high expression of cholesterol-producing HMGCR but failed to express the major cholesterol exporter ABCA1. LDL increased relative cell number of cancer cell lines, and these cells were less vulnerable than normal cells to cholesterol-lowering simvastatin treatment. Our study supports the importance of LDL for prostate cancer cells, and suggests that cholesterol metabolism in prostate cancer has been reprogrammed to increased production in order to support rapid cell growth.""","""['Teemu J Murtola', 'Heimo Syvälä', 'Pasi Pennanen', 'Merja Bläuer', 'Tiina Solakivi', 'Timo Ylikomi', 'Teuvo L J Tammela']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Effects of simvastatin, acetylsalicylic acid, and rosiglitazone on proliferation of normal and cancerous prostate epithelial cells at therapeutic concentrations.', 'Human prostate cancer cells lack feedback regulation of low-density lipoprotein receptor and its regulator, SREBP2.', 'The effects of metformin and simvastatin on the growth of LNCaP and RWPE-1 prostate epithelial cell lines.', 'Comparative effects of high and low-dose simvastatin on prostate epithelial cells: the role of LDL.', 'Deferoxamine stimulates LDLR expression and LDL uptake in HepG2 cells.', 'Adaptive and non-adaptive gene expression responses in prostate cancer during androgen deprivation.', 'Emerging Hallmarks of Metabolic Reprogramming in Prostate Cancer.', 'Pleotropic effects of statins: the dilemma of wider utilization of statin.', 'Association between genetically proxied PCSK9 inhibition and prostate cancer risk: A Mendelian randomisation study.', ""Role of Lipids and Lipid Metabolism in Prostate Cancer Progression and the Tumor's Immune Environment.""]"""

Most castration-resistant prostate tumors continue to express the androgen receptor (AR) as well as androgen-responsive genes, despite the near absence of circulating androgen in these patients. The AR is regulated not only by its cognate steroid hormone, but also by interactions with a constellation of co-regulatory and signaling molecules. Thus, the elevated signaling activity that occurs during progression to castration resistance can affect prostate cancer cell growth either through the AR or independent of the AR. In order to identify signaling pathways that regulate prostate cancer cell growth, we screened a panel of shRNAs targeting 673 human kinases against LNCaP prostate cancer cells grown in the presence and absence of hormone. The screen identified multiple shRNA clones against known and novel gene targets that regulate prostate cancer cell growth. Based on the magnitude of effect on growth, we selected six kinases for further study: MAP3K11, DGKD, ICK, CIT, GALK2, and PSKH1. Knockdown of these kinases decreased cell growth in both androgen-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer cells. However, these kinases had different effects on basal or androgen-induced transcriptional activity of AR target genes. MAP3K11 knockdown most consistently altered transcription of AR target genes, suggesting that MAP3K11 affected its growth inhibitory effect by modulating the AR transcriptional program. Consistent with MAP3K11 acting on the AR, knockdown of MAP3K11 inhibited AR Ser 650 phosphorylation, further supporting stress kinase regulation of AR phosphorylation. This study demonstrates the applicability of lentiviral-based shRNA for conducting phenotypic screens and identifies MAP3K11, DGKD, ICK, CIT, GALK2, and PSKH1 as regulators of prostate cancer cell growth. The thorough evaluation of these kinase targets will pave the way for developing more effective treatments for castration-resistant prostate cancer.""","""['Hilary Whitworth', 'Shriti Bhadel', 'Melissa Ivey', 'Mark Conaway', 'Andrea Spencer', 'Ronald Hernan', 'Heather Holemon', 'Daniel Gioeli']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Identification of novel genes that regulate androgen receptor signaling and growth of androgen-deprived prostate cancer cells.', 'The NLR-related protein NWD1 is associated with prostate cancer and modulates androgen receptor signaling.', 'Androgen receptor and its splice variant, AR-V7, differentially regulate FOXA1 sensitive genes in LNCaP prostate cancer cells.', 'Androgen action in the prostate gland.', 'Androgen receptor-dependent and -independent mechanisms driving prostate cancer progression: Opportunities for therapeutic targeting from multiple angles.', 'PSKH1 affects proliferation and invasion of osteosarcoma cells via the p38/MAPK signaling pathway.', 'Screening and identification of key biomarkers of depression using bioinformatics.', 'Regulation of Kinase Signaling Pathways by α6β4-Integrins and Plectin in Prostate Cancer.', 'Urinary marker panels for aggressive prostate cancer detection.', 'The Hippo effector YAP1/TEAD1 regulates EPHA3 expression to control cell contact and motility.']"""

An obstacle currently impeding translational progress has been the inability to quantify the mAb dose that reaches the tumor site and binds to the targeted TAs. The coupling of mAb to nanoparticle-based magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) probes should permit in vivo measurement of patient-specific biodistributions; these measurements could facilitate future development of novel dosimetry paradigms wherein mAb dose is titrated to optimize outcomes for individual patients.  Methods:   The prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA) is broadly expressed on the surface of prostate cancer (PCa) cells. Anti-human PSCA monoclonal antibodies (mAb 7F5) were bound to Au/Fe(3)O(4) (GoldMag) nanoparticles (mAb 7F5@GoldMag) to serve as PSCA-specific theragnostic MRI probe permitting visualization of mAb biodistribution in vivo. First, the antibody immobilization efficiency of the GoldMag particles and the efficacy for PSCA-specific binding was assessed. Next, PC-3 (prostate cancer with PSCA over-expression) and SMMC-7721 (hepatoma cells without PSCA expression) tumor-bearing mice were injected with mAb 7F5@GoldMag for MRI. MRI probe biodistributions were assessed at increasing time intervals post-infusion; therapy response was evaluated with serial tumor volume measurements.  Results:   Targeted binding of the mAb 7F5@GoldMag probes to PC-3 cells was verified using optical images and MRI; selective binding was not observed for SMMC-7721 tumors. The immunotherapeutic efficacy of the mAb 7F5@GoldMag in PC-3 tumor-bearing mice was verified with significant inhibition of tumor growth compared to untreated control animals.  Conclusion:   Our promising results suggest the feasibility of using mAb 7F5@GoldMag probes as a novel paradigm for the detection and immunotherapeutic treatment of PCa.

The present study examined the effects of SPDEF on tumor cell metastasis using prostate tumor cells as a model. Utilizing two experimental metastasis models, we demonstrate that SPDEF inhibits cell migration and invasion in vitro and acts a tumor metastasis suppressor in vivo. Using stable expression of SPDEF in PC3-Luc cells and shRNA-mediated knockdown of SPDEF in LNCaP-Luc cells, we demonstrate for the first time that SPDEF diminished the ability of disseminated tumors cells to survive at secondary sites and establish micrometastases. These effects on tumor metastasis were not a result of the effect of SPDEF on cell growth as SPDEF expression had no effect on cell growth in vitro or subcutaneous tumor xenograft-growth in vivo. Transcriptional analysis of several genes associated with tumor metastasis, invasion, and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition demonstrated that SPDEF expression selectively down-regulated MMP9 and MMP13 in prostate cancer cells. Further analysis indicated that forced MMP9 or MMP13 expression rescued the invasive phenotype in SPDEF expressing PC3 cells in vitro, suggesting that the effects of SPDEF on tumor invasion are mediated, in part, through the suppression of MMP9 and MMP13 expression.

Methods:   In a nested case-control design, 1,542 incident prostate cancer cases from eight European countries were individually matched to 1,542 controls by study center, age at recruitment, duration of follow-up, time of day, and duration of fasting at blood collection.

Abrogation of Sox9 expression prior to the initiation of androgen signaling blocks the initiation of prostate development. Similarly, Sox9 deletion in two genetic models of prostate cancer (TRAMP and Hi-Myc) prevented cancer initiation. Expression profiling of Sox9-null prostate epithelial cells revealed that the role of Sox9 in the initiation of prostate development may relate to its regulation of multiple cytokeratins and cell adherence/ polarity.

Methods:   PPAT conditioned media (CM) were obtained from tissue samples from patients with clinically primary PCa (TPPAT) or BPH (BPPAT).

Methods:   We conducted a descriptive population-based study of incident cases of prostate cancer (International Classification of Diseases version 10 codes for prostate cancer) in the West of Scotland, using the Scottish Cancer Registry data from 1991 to 2007. Socio-economic circumstances were measured using the Carstairs score, and disease grade measured using the Gleason score. Deprivation-specific European age-standardised incidence rates were calculated, and joinpoint regression analysis were used to identify significant changes in trends over time.  Results:   A total of 15 519 incident cases of prostate cancer were diagnosed. Incidence increased by 70% from 44 to 75 per 100 000 cases between 1991 and 2007, an average annual growth of 3.6%. Men aged <65 years experienced the largest increase in incidence. A widening socio-economic deprivation gap in incidence appeared from 1998 onwards in low-grade disease only. From 2003 to 2007, the deprivation gap (affluent to deprived) was 40.3 per 100 000 cases (P<0.001; trend), with rates 37% lower among the most deprived compared with the most affluent. This deprivation gap represents an estimated 1764 cases of prostate cancer over a 5-year period.  Conclusion:   Prostate cancer incidence continues to increase; an increase in low-grade disease in affluent men may suggest that prostate-specific antigen testing is responsible, but it does not explain the overall increases in all grades of disease.""","""['K Shafique', 'R Oliphant', 'D S Morrison']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Br J Cancer""","""['Socio-economic inequalities in survival of patients with prostate cancer: role of age and Gleason grade at diagnosis.', 'Socio-economic inequalities in the incidence of four common cancers: a population-based registry study.', 'Socioeconomic variation and prostate specific antigen testing in the community: a United Kingdom based population study.', 'Breast cancer incidence trends in deprived and affluent Scottish women.', 'Metastatic prostate cancer incidence in Australia after amendment to prostate-specific antigen screening guidelines.', 'Neighbourhood social deprivation and risk of prostate cancer.', 'Spatio-temporal mapping of breast and prostate cancers in South Iran from 2014 to 2017.', 'Socioeconomic inequalities in cancer incidence in Europe: a comprehensive review of population-based epidemiological studies.', 'Geographical Variations in Prostate Cancer Outcomes: A Systematic Review of International Evidence.', 'Literature review of the burden of prostate cancer in Germany, France, the United Kingdom and Canada.']"""

The approach involves the reliable detection of a subset of radioactive seeds from 3-D ultrasound, and the use of needle tracks in both ultrasound and fluoroscopy for registration. Seed detection in ultrasound is achieved through template matching in 3-D radio frequency ultrasound signals, followed by thresholding and spatial filtering. The resulting subset of seeds is registered to the complete reconstruction of the brachytherapy implant from multiple C-arm fluoroscopy views. To compensate for the deformation caused by the ultrasound probe, simulated warping is applied to the seed cloud from fluoroscopy. The magnitude of the applied warping is optimized within the registration process. The registration is performed in two stages. First, the needle track projections from fluoroscopy and ultrasound are matched. Only the seeds in the matched needles are then used as fiducials for point-based registration. We report results from a physical phantom with a realistic implant (average postregistration seed distance of 1.6 ± 1.2 mm) and from five clinical patient datasets (average error: 2.8 ± 1.5 mm over 128 detected seeds).

AND WHAT DOES THE STUDY ADD?: Currently available nomograms to predict preoperative risk of early biochemical recurrence (EBCR) after radical prostatectomy are solely based on classic clinicopathological variables. Despite providing useful predictions, these models are not perfect. Indeed, most researchers agree that nomograms can be improved by incorporating novel biomarkers. In the last few years, several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been associated with prostate cancer, but little is known about their impact on disease recurrence. We have identified four SNPs associated with EBCR. The addition of SNPs to classic nomograms resulted in a significant improvement in terms of discrimination and calibration. The new nomogram, which combines clinicopathological and genetic variables, will help to improve prediction of prostate cancer recurrence.  Objectives:   To evaluate genetic susceptibility to early biochemical recurrence (EBCR) after radical prostatectomy (RP), as a prognostic factor for early systemic dissemination. To build a preoperative nomogram to predict EBCR combining genetic and clinicopathological factors.  Patients and methods:   We evaluated 670 patients from six University Hospitals who underwent RP for clinically localized prostate cancer (PCa), and were followed-up for at least 5 years or until biochemical recurrence. EBCR was defined as a level prostate-specific antigen >0.4 ng/mL within 1 year of RP; preoperative variables studied were: age, prostate-specific antigen, clinical stage, biopsy Gleason score, and the genotype of 83 PCa-related single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Univariate allele association tests and multivariate logistic regression were used to generate predictive models for EBCR, with clinicopathological factors and adding SNPs. We internally validated the models by bootstrapping and compared their accuracy using the area under the curve (AUC), net reclassification improvement, integrated discrimination improvement, calibration plots and Vickers' decision curves.  Results:   Four common SNPs at KLK3, KLK2, SULT1A1 and BGLAP genes were independently associated with EBCR. A significant increase in AUC was observed when SNPs were added to the model: AUC (95% confidence interval) 0.728 (0.674-0.784) vs 0.763 (0.708-0.817). Net reclassification improvement showed a significant increase in probability for events of 60.7% and a decrease for non-events of 63.5%. Integrated discrimination improvement and decision curves confirmed the superiority of the new model.

The idea of using photosensitizing agents to enhance visualization of cancer tissue dates back to 1900. 5-Aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) was first suggested for photodynamic diagnosis (PDD) of transitional cell cancer (TCC) of the bladder in 1992. Since then, PDD with intravesical application of 5-ALA or its ester hexaminolevulinate (Hexvix) has proven to be superior over standard white-light cystoscopy in detection of carcinoma in situ and dysplasia as well as enhancing margins of TCC. PDD of upper urinary tract TCC is under-studied because of trouble with delivery of the photosensitizer. Fluorescence after oral 5-ALA was initially reported in 1956. Oral 5-ALA for photodynamic therapy was suggested for upper urinary tract TCC in 1998 and for refractory non-muscle invasive bladder cancer in 2001. A study in 2012 on oral and intravesical application of 5-ALA for bladder PDD showed no difference in diagnostic accuracy for each modality. To our knowledge our series is the first report on use of oral 5-ALA for PDD in detection of upper urinary tract tumours. We published our initial results in 2010. We think that our recent audit is quite encouraging. PDD ureterorenoscopy resulted in detection of additional urothelial tumours that could have been missed by the conventional white-light endoscopy. We suggest that this technique should be used in large multicentre trials to replicate our results.  Objective:   • To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of photodynamic diagnostic ureterorenoscopy after oral administration of 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) for upper urinary tract urothelial cancers.  Patients and methods:   • In this audit, twenty-six patients underwent thirty-nine procedures (cystoscopy/ureterorenoscopy) following oral administration of 5-ALA for photodynamic diagnosis (PDD). • Twenty mg/kg body weight of 5-ALA was given orally 3-4 hours prior to the planned endoscopic visualisation. • Following standard white light cystoscopy and ureterorenoscopy, photodynamic diagnostic endoscopy was performed using D-light system (Olympus PDD cystoscope and 7.5Fr KARL STORZ PDD Flex-X ureterorenoscope) to detect fluorescence. • Biopsies were carried out from all suspicious areas, noting if lesions were detected under white or blue light or both.  Results:   • A total of sixty-two biopsies were performed for suspicious urothelial lesions (35 bladder, 26 ureter/renal pelvis and 1 from prostatic urethra). • Of the 35 bladder biopsies, 11 lesions were seen under both white and blue light and 91% of these were malignant. • While 24 (68.5%) biopsies were taken from lesions seen only under blue light and 45.8% of these were malignant. • Similarly, of the 26 ureteric/renal pelvicalyceal biopsies, 11 were concurrent in both white and blue light and 100% of these were malignant. • While 10 (38.5%) lesions were seen only under blue light and 70% of these were malignant.  Conclusions:   • Photodynamic diagnosis using oral 5-ALA is safe and feasible with additional advantages of detecting lesions not visualised with conventional white light endoscopy. • This may translate into more complete treatment thereby decreasing subsequent recurrences and possibly progression of the upper urinary tract urothelial cancers.""","""['Sarfraz Ahmad', 'Omar Aboumarzouk', 'Bhaskar Somani', 'Ghulam Nabi', 'Slawomir Grzegorz Kata']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""[""Hexylaminolaevulinate 'blue light' fluorescence cystoscopy in the investigation of clinically unconfirmed positive urine cytology."", 'Photodynamic diagnosis (PDD) for upper urinary tract transitional cell carcinoma (UT-TCC): evolution of a new technique.', '5-aminolevulinic acid-mediated photodynamic diagnosis using fluorescence ureterorenoscopy for urinary upper tract urothelial carcinoma ∼Preliminary prospective single centre trial∼.', 'Diagnosis of urothelial carcinoma of the bladder using fluorescence endoscopy.', 'Novel endoscopic diagnosis for bladder cancer.', '5-Aminolevulinic Acid-Induced Protoporphyrin IX Fluorescence Imaging for Tumor Detection: Recent Advances and Challenges.', 'Differences in 5-Aminolevulinic Acid-Induced Hemodynamic Changes between Patients Undergoing Neurosurgery and Urological Surgery.', 'Photodynamic diagnostic ureteroscopy using the VISERA ELITE video system for diagnosis of upper-urinary tract urothelial carcinoma: a prospective cohort pilot study.', 'Developments in Vascular-Targeted Photodynamic Therapy for Urologic Malignancies.', 'Future strategies to enhance kidney preservation in upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma.']"""

Two of the new compounds bear the unusual aminosugar rednose, which was found here for the first time in angucyclines. The different attachment positions of this aminosugar in these two compounds indicate a high acceptor substrate flexibility of the responsible glycosyl transferase or alternatively the involvement of multiple glycosyl transferases.

Age and preoperative erectile function are the 2 patient factors that have been consistently shown to impact postoperative erectile function. The presence of vascular risk factors preoperatively seems to negatively impact erectile function recovery after radical prostatectomy independently from age, preoperative erectile function and surgical technique.  Objective:   To examine whether vascular risk factors (VRFs) affect erectile function (EF) recovery after radical prostatectomy (RP).  Patients and methods:   From our prospective database we identified patients with clinically localised prostate cancer who had undergone RP and had preoperative information on EF and VRFs (hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease [CAD], and cigarette smoking), surgeon-graded nerve-sparing status, and EF data collected between 24 and 30 months after RP.  Results:   In all, 984 patients were included in the analyses. The frequency of the VRFs was as follows: hypertension (38%), hypercholesterolaemia (36%), diabetes mellitus (7%), CAD (5%), and cigarette smoking (37%). On univariate analysis, EF between 24 and 30 months was associated with age (r = 0.37, P < 0.001), EF before RP (r = 0.41, P < 0.001), NSS (r = 0.35, P < 0.001), and VRFs (0-2 vs >3 VRFs; r = 0.15, P = 0.003). On multivariable analysis all variables remained statistically significant, and accounted for 28% of the total variance in EF between 24 and 30 months after RP.

What's known on the subject? and What does the study add? There is little data on the utility of digital rectal examination (DRE) as a diagnostic tool in the era of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing. Using a population-based database, we found that detection of prostate cancer while still localized among men with high-grade PSA-occult disease may result in survival benefit.  Objective:   • To determine whether detection of high-grade prostate cancer while still clinically localised on digital rectal examination (DRE) can improve survival in men with a normal prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level.  Patients and methods:   • From the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results database, 166,104 men with prostate cancer diagnosed between 2004 and 2007 were identified. • Logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with the occurrence of palpable, PSA-occult (PSA level of <2.5 ng/mL), Gleason score 8-10 prostate cancer. • Fine and Gray's and Cox multivariable regressions were used to analyse whether demographic, treatment, and clinicopathological factors were associated with the risk of prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM) and all-cause mortality (ACM), respectively.

The criteria used for selecting patients with prostate cancer for active surveillance (AS) are still not satisfactory due to the difficulty in predicting the significance of the prostate cancer. Urologists could predict insignificant prostate cancer by incorporating cumulative cancer length and biopsy Gleason score, derived from extended biopsy. The present study has added new criteria for predicting insignificant prostate cancer, which would lead to a better selection of candidates for AS.  Objective:   • To develop extended biopsy based criteria for predicting insignificant cancer (IC) using extended biopsy findings.  Patients and methods:   • From 2000 to 2009, 1575 patients with prostate cancer were primarily treated by radical prostatectomy in two referral hospitals. • Of these, the study cohort comprised 499 patients with extended biopsy confirmed, clinically organ-confined (cT1-2N0M0) prostate cancer with PSA levels of <20 ng/mL. • Cancer information obtained through extended biopsy included cumulative cancer length (CCL) divided by the number of biopsy cores (CCL/core).

All these ICs fell in a category of prostate cancer with clinical stage ≤ T2a and 2005 International Society of Urological Pathology Consensus Conference (ISUP) modified biopsy Gleason score ≤ 7. • Accordingly, we analysed predictors of IC in a subset cohort of 370 patients in this category. A multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that 2005 ISUP modified biopsy Gleason score and CCL/core were independently significant predictors of IC. • We determined a threshold value of CCL/core of 0.20 mm for predicting IC using receiver operating characteristic analysis. • Based on these findings, we developed simple extended biopsy based criteria for predicting IC as follows: (i) PSA level of <20 ng/mL; (ii) Clinical stage ≤ T2a; (iii) 2005 ISUP modified biopsy Gleason score ≤ 6; (iv) CCL/core of <0.20 mm. • The specificity of the criteria was 91%, which was significantly higher than the value from a subset of criteria without item iv (P < 0.001).

Diffusion-weighted (DW) MRI is a non-invasive technique measuring the microscopic mobility of water molecules in the tissues without contrast administration. It provides information on perfusion and diffusion simultaneously in any organ, so it can be used to differentiate normal and abnormal tissue structure, and it might help in the characterization of various abnormalities. In recent years, DW-MRI has been applied in the evaluation of urinary tract lesions, such as malignant renal, prostatic and bladder tumours; however, it has not previously been tested on its ability to distinguish residual cancer from fibrotic and inflammatory changes secondary to transurethral resection (TUR) and intravesical chemotherapy, both of which manifest as bladder-wall thickening on T2-weighted MRI. This is the first study to show the feasibility of DW-MRI in follow-up of patients with superficial bladder tumours after TUR. DW-MRI was highly reliable in differentiating post-TUR inflammatory changes from bladder tumours, with results similar to those of conventional cystoscopy. This non-invasive method could be used efficiently in future for follow-up of this patient group and may obviate the need for routine cystoscopy.  Objective:   • To study the feasibility of using diffusion-weighted (DW) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in bladder cancer follow-up after transurethral resection (TUR).  Patients and methods:   • Included in the study were 47 patients with a history of TUR of superficial bladder carcinoma, who were admitted to our centre between January and December 2011 for follow-up cystoscopy. • Before cystoscopy, DW-MRI was performed and the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value was measured in a circular region of interest within the carcinoma and normal bladder wall. • Two radiologists, blinded to the results of cystoscopy, independently interpreted the DW images. • A comparison of imaging findings with those of cystoscopy was performed using the McNemar test.  Results:   • In our 47 patients, cystoscopy identified 34 bladder lesions in 24 patients and in the remaining 23 the bladder looked normal. • In the 24 patients with malignant bladders, DW-MRI detected 32/34 tumours with two false-negative findings of lesions in two patients. • In 23 patients with non-malignant bladders, the DW-MRI data were accurate for 21 patients, as two patients were misdiagnosed as malignant. • The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive and negative predictive values of DW-MRI for identifying bladder tumours were 91.6% (22/24), 91.3% (21/23), 91.5% (43/47), 91.6 (22/24) and 91.3 (21/23), respectively. • Using the McNemar test there was no significant difference between DW-MRI and cystoscopy.  Conclusions:   • DW-MRI has a high reliability in differentiating post-TUR inflammatory changes from bladder tumours, which is similar to that of cystoscopy. • DW-MRI could be a first-line diagnostic test in follow-up of patients after TUR.""","""['Ahmed El-Assmy', 'Mohamed E Abou-El-Ghar', 'Huda F Refaie', 'Ahmed Mosbah', 'Tarek El-Diasty']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Evaluation of risk of muscle invasion, perivesical and/or lymph node affectation by diffusion-weighted magnetic nuclear resonance in the patient who is a candidate for radical cystectomy.', 'Combined T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted MRI for diagnosis of urinary bladder invasion in patients with prostate carcinoma.', 'Potential and limitations of diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging in kidney, prostate, and bladder cancer including pelvic lymph node staging: a critical analysis of the literature.', 'Urinary CYFRA 21.1 is not a useful marker for the detection of recurrences in the follow-up of superficial bladder cancer.', 'Magnetic resonance diffusion-weighted imaging: extraneurological applications.', 'Evaluation of Whole-Tumor Texture Analysis Based on MRI Diffusion Kurtosis and Biparametric VI-RADS Model for Staging and Grading Bladder Cancer.', 'Feasibility of Early Evaluation for the Recurrence of Bladder Cancer after Trans-Urethral Resection: A Comparison between Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Multidetector Computed Tomography.', 'Predicting Recurrence of Non-Muscle-Invasive Bladder Cancer: Current Techniques and Future Trends.', 'VI-RADS score system - A primer for urologists.', 'Diagnostic accuracy of vesical imaging-reporting and data system (VI-RADS) for the detection of muscle-invasive bladder cancer: a meta-analysis.']"""

The method provides a systematic approach to developing high-quality radiation therapy treatment plans.  Methods:   Treatment planners consider numerous dosimetric criteria of varying importance that, when optimized simultaneously through multicriteria optimization, yield a Pareto frontier which represents the set of Pareto-optimal treatment plans. However, generating and navigating this frontier is a time-consuming, nontrivial process. A lexicographic ordering (LO) approach to IMRT uses a physician's criteria preferences to partition the treatment planning decisions into a multistage treatment planning model. Because the relative importance of criteria optimized in the different stages may not necessarily constitute a strict prioritization, the authors introduce an interactive process, sensitivity analysis in lexicographic ordering (SALO), to allow the treatment planner control over the relative sequential-stage tradeoffs. By allowing this flexibility within a structured process, SALO implicitly restricts attention to and allows exploration of a subset of the Pareto efficient frontier that the physicians have deemed most important.  Results:   Improvements to treatment plans over a LO approach were found by implementing the SALO procedure on a brain case and a prostate case. In each stage, a physician assessed the tradeoff between previous stage and current stage criteria. The SALO method provided critical tradeoff information through curves approximating the relationship between criteria, which allowed the physician to determine the most desirable treatment plan.  Conclusions:   The SALO procedure provides treatment planners with a directed, systematic process to treatment plan selection. By following a physician's prioritization, the treatment planner can avoid wasting effort considering clinically inferior treatment plans. The planner is guided by criteria importance, but given the information necessary to accurately adjust the relative importance at each stage. Through these attributes, the SALO procedure delivers an approach well balanced between efficiency and flexibility.""","""['T Long', 'M Matuszak', 'M Feng', 'B A Fraass', 'R K Ten Haken', 'H E Romeijn']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Multicriteria plan optimization in the hands of physicians: a pilot study in prostate cancer and brain tumors.', 'Lexicographic ordering: intuitive multicriteria optimization for IMRT.', 'Pareto navigation: algorithmic foundation of interactive multi-criteria IMRT planning.', 'Dose-shaping using targeted sparse optimization.', 'Knowledge-based planning for intensity-modulated radiation therapy: A review of data-driven approaches.', 'Automated 4π radiotherapy treatment planning with evolving knowledge-base.', 'Optimization of rotational arc station parameter optimized radiation therapy.', 'Intensity modulated proton therapy.', 'A column-generation-based method for multi-criteria direct aperture optimization.']"""

However, once implanted, the seeds are vulnerable to loss and movement. The goal of this work is to investigate the dosimetric and radiobiological effects of the types of seed loss and migration commonly seen in prostate brachytherapy.  Methods:   Five patients were used in this study. For each patient three treatment plans were created using Iodine-125, Palladium-103, and Cesium-131 seeds. The three seeds that were closest to the urethra were identified and modeled as the seeds lost through the urethra. The three seeds closest to the exterior of prostatic capsule were identified and modeled as those lost from the prostate periphery. The seed locations and organ contours were exported from Prowess and used by in-house software to perform the dosimetric and radiobiological evaluation. Seed loss was simulated by simultaneously removing 1, 2, or 3 seeds near the urethra 0, 2, or 4 days after the implant or removing seeds near the exterior of the prostate 14, 21, or 28 days after the implant.  Results:   Loss of one, two or three seeds through the urethra results in a D(90) reduction of 2%, 5%, and 7% loss, respectively. Due to delayed loss of peripheral seeds, the dosimetric effects are less severe than for loss through the urethra. However, while the dose reduction is modest for multiple lost seeds, the reduction in tumor control probability was minimal.  Conclusions:   The goal of this work was to investigate the dosimetric and radiobiological effects of the types of seed loss and migration commonly seen in prostate brachytherapy. The results presented show that loss of multiple seeds can cause a substantial reduction of D(90) coverage.

In this study, the authors explored the application of DET in IMPT (IMPT-DET) and conducted robust optimization of IMPT-DET to see if the planning technique's sensitivity to uncertainties was reduced. They also compared conventional and robust optimization of IMPT-DET with three-dimensional IMPT (IMPT-3D) to gain understanding about how plan robustness is achieved.  Methods:   They compared the robustness of IMPT-DET and IMPT-3D plans to uncertainties by analyzing plans created for a typical prostate cancer case and a base of skull (BOS) cancer case (using data for patients who had undergone proton therapy at our institution). Spots with the highest and second highest energy layers were chosen so that the Bragg peak would be at the distal edge of the targets in IMPT-DET using 36 equally spaced angle beams; in IMPT-3D, 3 beams with angles chosen by a beam angle optimization algorithm were planned. Dose contributions for a number of range and setup uncertainties were calculated, and a worst-case robust optimization was performed. A robust quantification technique was used to evaluate the plans' sensitivity to uncertainties.  Results:   With no uncertainties considered, the DET is less robust to uncertainties than is the 3D method but offers better normal tissue protection. With robust optimization to account for range and setup uncertainties, robust optimization can improve the robustness of IMPT plans to uncertainties; however, our findings show the extent of improvement varies.  Conclusions:   IMPT's sensitivity to uncertainties can be improved by using robust optimization. They found two possible mechanisms that made improvements possible: (1) a localized single-field uniform dose distribution (LSFUD) mechanism, in which the optimization algorithm attempts to produce a single-field uniform dose distribution while minimizing the patching field as much as possible; and (2) perturbed dose distribution, which follows the change in anatomical geometry. Multiple-instance optimization has more knowledge of the influence matrices; this greater knowledge improves IMPT plans' ability to retain robustness despite the presence of uncertainties.""","""['Wei Liu', 'Yupeng Li', 'Xiaoqiang Li', 'Wenhua Cao', 'Xiaodong Zhang']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Comparison of linear and nonlinear programming approaches for ""worst case dose"" and ""minmax"" robust optimization of intensity-modulated proton therapy dose distributions.', 'Robust optimization of intensity modulated proton therapy.', 'Robust optimization for intensity-modulated proton therapy with soft spot sensitivity regularization.', 'Reflections on beam configuration optimization for intensity-modulated proton therapy.', 'Empowering Intensity Modulated Proton Therapy Through Physics and Technology: An Overview.', 'Beam mask and sliding window-facilitated deep learning-based accurate and efficient dose prediction for pencil beam scanning proton therapy.', 'Deep-Learning-based Fast and Accurate 3D CT Deformable Image Registration in Lung Cancer.', 'Longitudinally Heterogeneous Tumor Dose Optimizes Proton Broadbeam, Interlaced Minibeam, and FLASH Therapy.', 'A Review of Proton Therapy - Current Status and Future Directions.', 'Virtual particle Monte Carlo: A new concept to avoid simulating secondary particles in proton therapy dose calculation.']"""

This work assessed the dosimetric impact of manual interventions on ERB position in patients receiving prostate SBRT and investigated the impact of ERB interventions on prostate shape.  Methods:   The data of seven consecutive patients receiving SBRT for the treatment of clinical stage T1cN0M0 prostate cancer enrolled in a multi-institutional, IRB-approved trial were analyzed. The SBRT dose was 50 Gy in five fractions to a planning target volume (PTV) that included the prostate (implanted with three fiducial markers) with a 3-5 mm margin. All plans were based on simulation images that included an ERB inflated with 60 cm(3) of air. Daily kilovoltage cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) imaging was performed to localize the PTV, and an automated fusion with the planning images yielded displacements required for PTV relocalization. When the ERB volume and/or position were judged to yield inaccurate repositioning, manual adjustment (ERB reinflation and/or repositioning) was performed. Based on all 59 CBCT image sets acquired, a deformable registration algorithm was used to determine the dose received by, displacement of, and deformation of the prostate, bladder (BLA), and anterior rectal wall (ARW). This dose tracking methodology was applied to images taken before and after manual adjustment of the ERB (intervention), and the delivered dose was compared to that which would have been delivered in the absence of intervention.  Results:   Interventions occurred in 24 out of 35 (69%) of the treated fractions. The direct effect of these interventions was an increase in the prostate radiation dose that included 95% of the PTV (D95) from 9.6 ± 1.0 to 10.0 ± 0.2 Gy (p = 0.06) and an increase in prostate coverage from 94.0% ± 8.5% to 97.8% ± 1.9% (p = 0.03). Additionally, ERB interventions reduced prostate deformation in the anterior-posterior (AP) direction, reduced errors in the sagittal rotation of the prostate, and increased the similarity in shape of the prostate to the radiotherapy plan (increased Dice coefficient from 0.76 ± 0.06 to 0.80 ± 0.04, p = 0.01). Postintervention decreases in prostate volume receiving less than the prescribed dose and decreases in the voxel-wise displacement of the prostate, bladder, and anterior rectal wall were observed, which resulted in improved dose-volume histogram (DVH) characteristics.  Conclusions:   Image-guided interventions in ERB volume and/or position during prostate SBRT were necessary to ensure the delivery of the dose distribution as planned.

Imatinib has shown preclinical activity against HRPC although minimal clinical therapeutic efficacy. Our previous in vitro studies demonstrated that simultaneous combination of imatinib with mitoxantrone yielded additive growth inhibition effects against PC-3 cell line. The main aim of the work was to develop novel liposomal formulations comprising imatinib co-encapsulated with mitoxantrone, by different loading methods and experimental conditions, in order to achieve the highest drug loading and maximum physical stability. In the optimized formulations, imatinib and mitoxantrone were actively co-loaded by means of a (NH4)2SO4 transmembrane gradient.

Our study presented for the first time an active loading method for imatinib and suggests that the optimized liposomal formulation co-encapsulates both drugs with high encapsulation efficiency (> 95%), shows enhanced drug retention under tested conditions and delivers a drug:drug ratio capable of improving tumor cell growth inhibition with a mitoxantrone dose reduction of 2.6-fold as compared to single liposomal formulation.

The objective of this study was to assess the relation between a cancer diagnosis and future cancer screening, exploring provider-, patient-, and cancer-specific factors that explain observed relationships.  Methods:   The Wisconsin Longitudinal Study (WLS) and Wisconsin Tumor Registry were used to identify 2 participant groups: 415 patients diagnosed with nonmetastatic cancer between 1992 to 1993 (before cancer) and 2003 to 2004 (after cancer) and 4680 controls (no cancer). Adjusted average predicted probabilities of cancer screening were estimated with models that first did not include and then included, provider (provider relationship length), participant (depressive symptoms per the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale), and cancer-specific (time since diagnosis) factors. Participants with a history of cancer associated with a given screening test were then excluded to assess whether relationships are explained by screening for recurrence versus second cancers.  Results:   Female cancer survivors were more likely than no-cancer controls to undergo pelvic/Papanicolaou screening (survivors: 70%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 63% to 76%; controls: 61%, 95% CI: 59% to 63%) and mammography screening (survivors: 86%, 95% CI: 78% to 90%; controls: 76%, 95% CI: 74% to 77%), though male cancer survivors were not more likely to receive prostate exams (survivors: 76%, 95% CI: 70% to 82%; controls: 69%, 95% CI: 67% to 71%). After excluding people with a history of the cancer being screened for, there were few significant differences in cancer screening between short- or long-term survivors (≥5 years) and no-cancer controls. Relationships were not sensitive to adjustment for provider or participant factors.  Conclusions:   The significant positive differences in cancer screening between people with and without cancer can be explained by screening for recurrence. Long-term cancer survivors are not more likely to receive follow-up screening for second cancers. This information should be used by providers to ensure patients receive recommended follow-up preventive care.""","""['Jessica R Schumacher', 'Whitney P Witt', 'Mari Palta', 'Noelle K Loconte', 'Susan M Heidrich', 'Amy Trentham-Dietz', 'Nancy Pandhi', 'Maureen A Smith']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""J Am Board Fam Med""","""['Cancer screening practices among racially and ethnically diverse breast cancer survivors: results from the 2001 and 2003 California health interview survey.', 'Cancer screening among patients with advanced cancer.', 'Preventive care in prostate cancer patients: following diagnosis and for five-year survivors.', 'Screening for Skin Cancer in Adults: An Updated Systematic Evidence Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.', 'Screening for Cervical Cancer With High-Risk Human Papillomavirus Testing: A Systematic Evidence Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.', 'Preventative Cancer Screening Rates Among Uninsured Patients in Free Clinics: A Retrospective Cohort Study of Cancer Survivors and Non-cancer Survivors.', 'Cervical Cancer Screening Among Patients with Physical Disability.', 'Trends in Participation Rates of the National Cancer Screening Program among Cancer Survivors in Korea.', 'Participation in breast cancer screening among breast cancer survivors -A nationwide register-based cohort study.', 'Cancer surveillance and preventive services in a diverse sample of breast and colorectal cancer survivors.']"""

Firstly, Hypergeometric analysis against KEGG database for HK genes disclosed that three disease terms (Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, Alzheimer's disease) are intensively enriched. Secondly, Hypergeometric analysis against the KEGG database for Skeletal Muscle tissue genes shows that two cardiac diseases of ""Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM)"" and ""Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC)"" are heavily enriched, which are also considered as no relationship with skeletal functions.

The symptoms of this disease are increased prostate size, bladder outlet obstruction and lower urinary tract disorders. It influences bladder infections, bladder stone formation and increases the risk of urinary retention which can cause renal failure. It is necessary for the disease to be treated operatively. The number of conducted surgical interventions for pharmacotherapy has been significantly reduced in recent years due to increased efficacy in conservative therapy including combined treatment mostly with two groups of drugs: finasteride and alpha-blockers with different pharmacological activities. The aim of the study was to evaluate finasteride efficacy in the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia.  Materials and methods:   The clinical trial was conducted from October 2008 to November 2009. According to the urologist's recommendation the patients took finasteride at a dose of 5 mg daily. A total of 4,315 patients participated in the clinical trial and were enrolled in 50 urological centres in Poland. The average age of the patients was 66.5 years, the youngest patient was 46 and the oldest was 91 (median 67.00 years, standard deviation SD±8.101). The use of finasteride at least for 2 weeks was the criterion for the patient to be included in the study. The medical trial lasted 12 months and consisted of 6 visits at which data relating to IPSS, QoL, intensification of urinary system symptoms, the results of the additional studies, PSA serum concentrations, the urinary tract USG with evaluation of residual urine and prostate, urine analysis with evaluation of crystalline, uroflowmetry, transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS) and biopsy were recorded. The study did not exclude the combined treatment with finasteride and alpha-adrenergic blocking drugs.  Results:   Prostatocystitis was diagnosed in 30 men among the patients treated at the first visit after the digital rectal examination (DRE) trial and they qualified for antibiotic therapy. Suspicion of a tumor was diagnosed in 69 (1.59 %) patients of the study group at the first visit after the DRE trial and they qualified for biopsy of the prostate after the PSA trial and TRUS at the second visit. Therefore, 4,216 patients took part in the clinical trial. In the course of 12 months 392 patients were excuded from the study for different reasons: cardiac infarct, apoplexy, resignation without reason and change of address. According to the IPSS scale (International Prostate Symptom Score) a small intensification of symptoms was diagnosed in 676 patients (16%), in 2,830 patients (67%) moderate and in 718 patients (17 %) considerable. Prostate cancer was confirmed histopathologically in 50 (1.15%) out of 69 patients who qualified for biopsy of the prostate. In 2,677 (70%) patients taking both alpha-blocker and finasteride, the progression of disease reduced, the micturation improved considerably and the mass of adenoma of the prostate diminished by 40%. However, in 956 (25%) patients taking only finasteride or finasteride + phytotherapy the mass of adenoma of the prostate diminished by 40%, too. When the medical trial was finished, 212 patients (5.02 %) of the study group who showed intensive symptoms of BPH and the finasteride and alfa-blocker treatment proved not to be effective enough qualified for surgical therapy. A total of 3,824 out of 4,216 (90.7%) patients finished the medical trial and 3,612 (85.6 %) were willing to continue the further therapy.""","""['T Ząbkowski']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Urologe A""","""['Evaluation of the clinical indications, adverse drug reactions, and finasteride use in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia in Poland.', 'Monotherapy versus combination drug therapy for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'Efficacy and safety of Finasteride (5 alpha-reductase inhibitor) monotherapy in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia: A critical review of the literature.', 'Ultrasound image features of intravesical prostatic protrusion indicated failure of medication therapy of finasteride and doxazosin in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (LUTS/BPH).', 'Influence of baseline variables on changes in International Prostate Symptom Score after combined therapy with dutasteride plus tamsulosin or either monotherapy in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia and lower urinary tract symptoms: 4-year results of the CombAT study.']"""

In this study, ex vivo and in vivo experiments were performed using a prostate-dedicated endorectal phased array (16 circular elements arranged on a truncated spherical cap of radius 60 mm) and a translation-rotation mechanical actuator in order to evaluate the lesion formation and the potential interest of dual-modality (electronic and mechanical) interleaved displacement of the focus for volumetric sonication paradigms. Different sonication sequences, including elementary lesions, line scan, slice sweeping and volume sonications, were investigated with a clinical 1.5 T MR scanner. Two orthogonal planes (axial and sagittal) were simultaneously monitored using rapid MR thermometry (PRFS method) and the temperature and thermal dose maps were displayed in real time. No RF interferences were detected in MR acquisition during sonications. The shape of the thermal lesions in vivo was examined at day 5 post-treatment by MRI follow-up (T2w sequence and Gd-T1w-TFE) and postmortem histological analysis. This study suggests that electronic displacement of the focus (along the ultrasound propagation axis) interleaved with mechanical X-Z translations and rotation around B(0) can be a suitable modality to treat patient-specific sizes and shapes of a pathologic tissue. The electronic displacement of focus (achieved in less than 0.1 s) is an order of magnitude faster than the mechanical motion of the HIFU device (1 s latency). As an example, for an in vivo volumetric sonication with foci between 32 and 47 mm (7 successive line scans, 11 lines/slice, 4 foci/line) with applied powers between 17.4 and 39.1 Wac, a total duration of sonication of 408.1 s was required to ablate a volume of approximately 5.7 cm(3) (semi-chronic lesion measured at day 5), while the maximum temperature elevation reached was 30 °C. While electronic focusing is necessary to speed up the procedure, one should consider as a potential drawback the non-negligible risk for generating secondary lobes with full steering in 3D. Reference-free PRFS thermometry accurately removed the effects of B(o) dynamic perturbation in the vicinity of the moving transducer. Therefore, the dual-modality volumetric sonication paradigm represents a cost-effective technological compromise to induce the desired shape of the lesion in the prostate through the limited endorectal space, in a reasonable period of time and without side effects.""","""['Lorena Petrusca', 'Jacqueline Ngo', 'Lucie Brasset', 'Emmanuel Blanc', 'Adriana Murillo', 'Vincent Auboiroux', 'François Cotton', 'Jean-Yves Chapelon', 'Rares Salomir']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Interleaved Mapping of Temperature and Longitudinal Relaxation Rate to Monitor Drug Delivery During Magnetic Resonance-Guided High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound-Induced Hyperthermia.', 'Magnetic resonance-guided shielding of prefocal acoustic obstacles in focused ultrasound therapy: application to intercostal ablation in liver.', 'Ultrasonography-based 2D motion-compensated HIFU sonication integrated with reference-free MR temperature monitoring: a feasibility study ex vivo.', 'Magnetic resonance-guided high-intensity ultrasound ablation of the prostate.', 'Transrectal high-intensity focused ultrasound for local treatment of prostate cancer: current role.', 'Image-guided ultrasound phased arrays are a disruptive technology for non-invasive therapy.', 'An experimental model to investigate the targeting accuracy of MR-guided focused ultrasound ablation in liver.']"""

Abiraterone pre-docetaxel is currently undergoing evaluation in a phase III study. In vitro studies indicate that taxanes may act by disrupting androgen receptor signalling. We hypothesised that prior abiraterone exposure would adversely impact docetaxel efficacy.  Patients and methods:   We retrospectively evaluated activity of docetaxel in mCRPC patients previously treated with abiraterone, using Prostate Cancer Working Group and radiological criteria.  Results:   Of the 54 patients treated with abiraterone, 35 subsequently received docetaxel. Docetaxel resulted in a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) decline of ≥50% in nine patients [26%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 13% to 43%], with a median time to PSA progression of 4.6 months (95% CI 4.2% to 5.9%). PSA declines ≥30% were achieved by 13 patients (37%, 95% CI 22% to 55%). The median overall survival was 12.5 months (95% CI 10.6-19.4). All patients who failed to achieve a PSA fall on abiraterone and were deemed abiraterone-refractory were also docetaxel-refractory (N = 8). In the 24 patients with radiologically evaluable disease, partial responses were reported in four patients (11%), none of whom were abiraterone-refractory.

ATAD2 is a coactivator of the androgen receptor (AR) and the MYC protein. We showed that ATAD2 expression is directly regulated by AR via an AR binding sequence (ARBS) located in the distal enhancer of its regulatory region. The gene is also regulated by the E2F1 transcription factor. Using knockdown and chromatin immunoprecipitation technique approaches, we could demonstrate that AR and E2F1 functionally collaborate and physically interact between each other. From the analysis of chromatin conformation, we conclude that this cooperation results from a chromatin looping over the ATAD2 promoter region between the ARBS and E2F1 binding site in an androgen-dependent manner. Furthermore, we could show that several genes overexpressed in prostate cancer and potentially involved in several aspects of tumor development have an ARBS and an E2F1 binding site in their regulatory regions and exhibit the same mechanism of regulation by both transcription factors as ATAD2.""","""['D M Altintas', 'M S Shukla', 'D Goutte-Gattat', 'D Angelov', 'J P Rouault', 'S Dimitrov', 'Jacques Samarut']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Mol Endocrinol""","""['Repression of androgen receptor transcription through the E2F1/DNMT1 axis.', 'Induction of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and modulation of androgen receptor by ETS variant 1/ETS-related protein 81.', 'Regulation of a novel androgen receptor target gene, the cyclin B1 gene, through androgen-dependent E2F family member switching.', 'Elevated E2F1 inhibits transcription of the androgen receptor in metastatic hormone-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Tumor-Promoting ATAD2 and Its Preclinical Challenges.', 'ATAD2 is a driver and a therapeutic target in ovarian cancer that functions by upregulating CENPE.', 'Rbf/E2F1 control growth and endoreplication via steroid-independent Ecdysone Receptor signalling in Drosophila prostate-like secondary cells.', 'ATAD2 promotes glycolysis and tumor progression in clear cell renal cell carcinoma by regulating the transcriptional activity of c-Myc.', 'Significance of RB Loss in Unlocking Phenotypic Plasticity in Advanced Cancers.', 'ATPase family AAA domain-containing protein 2 (ATAD2): From an epigenetic modulator to cancer therapeutic target.']"""

Results:   Across all three dimensions, pain, lack of energy, feeling drowsy, and difficulty sleeping followed a decreasing linear trend. Problems with urination and diarrhea demonstrated more complex patterns of change over time.  Conclusion:   Although longitudinal data on pain, lack of energy, feeling drowsy, and difficulty sleeping are limited, they are highly prevalent symptoms in these patients.

Methods:   Eighty-six patients with advanced lung, prostate, colorectal, or gynecologic cancers receiving treatment at a comprehensive cancer center were stratified by recruitment clinics (chemotherapy and radiation therapy) and randomized to intervention or control groups. Forty-three patients were assigned to receive training in and use of up to 12 relaxation, imagery, or distraction exercises delivered via an MP3 player for two weeks during cancer treatment. Forty-three patients were assigned to a waitlist control condition for the same two week period. Outcomes included symptom cluster severity and overall symptom interference with daily life measured at baseline (Time 1) and two weeks later (Time 2).  Results:   Eight participants dropped out; 78 completed the study and were analyzed (36 intervention and 42 control subjects). Participants used the CB strategies an average of 13.65 times (SD=6.98). Controlling for baseline symptom cluster severity and other relevant covariates, it was found that the symptom cluster severity at Time 2 was lower in the intervention group (M(Adj)=2.99, SE=0.29) than in the waitlist group (M(Adj)=3.87, SE=0.36), F(1, 65)=3.57, P=0.032. Symptom interference with daily life did not differ between groups. No significant adverse events were noted with the CB intervention.

In 2008, the National Cancer Institute began building the Quantitative Imaging Network (QIN) initiative with the goal of advancing quantitative imaging in the context of personalized therapy and evaluation of treatment response. Computerized analysis is an important component contributing to reproducibility and efficiency of the quantitative imaging techniques. The success of quantitative imaging is contingent on robust analysis methods and software tools to bring these methods from bench to bedside. 3D Slicer is a free open-source software application for medical image computing. As a clinical research tool, 3D Slicer is similar to a radiology workstation that supports versatile visualizations but also provides advanced functionality such as automated segmentation and registration for a variety of application domains. Unlike a typical radiology workstation, 3D Slicer is free and is not tied to specific hardware. As a programming platform, 3D Slicer facilitates translation and evaluation of the new quantitative methods by allowing the biomedical researcher to focus on the implementation of the algorithm and providing abstractions for the common tasks of data communication, visualization and user interface development. Compared to other tools that provide aspects of this functionality, 3D Slicer is fully open source and can be readily extended and redistributed. In addition, 3D Slicer is designed to facilitate the development of new functionality in the form of 3D Slicer extensions. In this paper, we present an overview of 3D Slicer as a platform for prototyping, development and evaluation of image analysis tools for clinical research applications.

Methods:   Retrospective analysis of 10 785 consecutive radical prostatectomy performed in 10 university hospitals (January 2003 through December 2008). A total of 919 patients fulfilled the following unique and very stringent criteria: T1c, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) <10 ng/mL, a single positive biopsy, tumor length <3 mm, and Gleason score <7. Clinico-biologic and pathologic data at diagnosis and after radical prostatectomy, prostatic and tumor volume, pathologic Gleason score and stage, positive surgical margins, insignificant prostate cancer, and PSA outcomes were recorded.  Results:   Median age was 63 years. Mean prebiopsy PSA level was 6.2 ng/mL. At radical prostatectomy, Gleason score was upgraded in 34% of patients, including 1.2% Gleason score 8-9.

Methods:   For low-risk PCa, active surveillance is frequently chosen as a monitoring strategy. Active surveillance has been shown to be associated with low anxiety levels and a fair health-related quality of life in patients. However, little is known about the impact on their partners. We hypothesized that the latter suffer more from PCa diagnosis than the men themselves. Therefore, between February and August 2010, 133 couples-a response rate of 46.9%-completed a written questionnaire at their individual time lags from PCa diagnosis. A Wilcoxon test was performed to assess how distress levels affected the couples' quality of life. Binary logistic regression was used to determine factors affecting distress levels.  Results:   The mean age was 66.2 years in partners and 69.3 in men. At the time quartiles, partners had anxiety scores of 5.5, 4.6, 5.4, and 5.6. Scores in men were statistically significantly lower: 3.9 (P = .05), 2.0 (P < .001), 3.3 (P = .002), and 3.3 (P = .02), respectively. However, the partners' scores were still well below 7 (ie, normal). Prostate-specific anxiety scores were below the clinical threshold as well: 15.5, 9.5, 6.5, and 9.0, respectively.

The objective of this work was to evaluate the influence of prostatic diseases on ED.  Materials and method:   Data on the influence of BPH and PCa on ED have been explored in Medline and Embase using the MeSH keywords: benign prostatic hyperplasia, prostate cancer, prostatectomy, external beam radiotherapy; androgen deprivation therapy; erectile dysfunction. The articles were selected based on their methodology, relevance, date and language of publication.  Results:   The rate of ED in patients with BPH ranged from 30 to 70 %. The LUTS were an independent risk factor of ED. The pathophysiology linking BPH to ED has not been elucidated but seems to involve the path of Nitric Oxide - cyclic Guanosine Monophosphate (cGMP-No.), the RhoA - Rho - Kinase (ROCK) signal, the sympathetic autonomic nervous system and pelvic atherosclerosis. The rate of ED after radical prostatectomy (RP) ranged from 60 to 89 %. The bilateral preservation of neurovascular bundels improved these results. Risk factors of ED after RP were age, PSA levels, pretreatment erectile function and surgical technique. The rate of ED after prostate external beam radiotherapy ranged from 6 to 84 %. Risk factors of ED after external beam radiotherapy were age, pretreatment erectile function and association of androgen deprivation therapy. The rate of ED with androgen deprivation therapy was 85 %. Risk factors of ED with androgen deprivation therapy were age > 70 years, diabetes and pretreatment erectile function. Intermittent androgen deprivation therapy was associated with better results on erectile function than continue androgen deprivation therapy.  Conclusion:   ED is responsible for a decrease of elderly patients life quality already affected by urinary symptoms and prostate disease progression.

Competitive binding assays on T47D breast and PC3 prostate cancer cells showed that the affinity for GRPR depends on the complexed metal and can vary up to a factor of about 3; (64)Cu/NOTA-PEG-BBN(6-14) was found to have the lowest inhibition constant (1.60 ± 0.59 nM). (64)Cu/and (68)Ga/NOTA-PEG-BBN(6-14) presented similar cell uptake on T47D and PC3 cells and were stable in vivo. Biodistribution studies of radiolabeled peptides carried out in Balb/c and tumor-bearing Balb/c nude mice showed that (64)Cu/NOTA-PEG-BBN(6-14) presented higher GRPR-mediated uptake in pancreas and adrenal glands, but comparable PC3 tumor uptake as (68)Ga/NOTA-PEG-BBN(6-14). Finally, receptor-dependent responses were observed during blocking studies with unlabeled peptide in both biodistribution and small-animal PET imaging studies. Our results confirmed the dependence of the affinity and pharmacokinetics of BBN-based radiopeptides on the complexed radiometal.

Methods:   In total, 141 patients with localized prostate cancer treated with image-guided IMRT (76 Gy in 13 patients and 80 Gy in 128 patients) between 2003 and 2008 were enrolled in this study. The patients were classified according to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network-defined risk groups. Thirty-six intermediate-risk patients and 105 high-risk patients were included. Androgen-deprivation therapy was performed in 124 patients (88%) for a median of 11 months (range: 2-88 months). Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) relapse was defined according to the Phoenix-definition (i.e., an absolute nadir plus 2 ng/ml dated at the call). The 5-year actuarial PSA relapse-free survival, the 5-year distant metastasis-free survival, the 5-year cause-specific survival (CSS), the 5-year overall survival (OS) outcomes and the acute and late toxicities were analyzed. The toxicity data were scored according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0. The median follow-up was 60 months.  Results:   The 5-year PSA relapse-free survival rates were 100% for the intermediate-risk patients and 82.2% for the high-risk patients; the 5-year actuarial distant metastasis-free survival rates were 100% and 95% for the intermediate- and high-risk patients, respectively; the 5-year CSS rates were 100% for both patient subsets; and the 5-year OS rates were 100% and 91.7% for the intermediate- and high-risk patients, respectively.

Although the underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive, cytoplasmic Skp2 correlates with more aggressive forms of breast and prostate cancers. Here, we report that Skp2 is acetylated by p300 at K68 and K71, which is a process that can be antagonized by the SIRT3 deacetylase. Inactivation of SIRT3 leads to elevated Skp2 acetylation, which leads to increased Skp2 stability through impairment of the Cdh1-mediated proteolysis pathway. As a result, Skp2 oncogenic function is increased, whereby cells expressing an acetylation-mimetic mutant display enhanced cellular proliferation and tumorigenesis in vivo. Moreover, acetylation of Skp2 in the nuclear localization signal (NLS) promotes its cytoplasmic retention, and cytoplasmic Skp2 enhances cellular migration through ubiquitination and destruction of E-cadherin.

This can cause positioning injuries as well as rhabdomyolysis. The primary diagnostic indicator of rhabdomyolysis is elevated serum creatine kinase (CK). We investigate whether RARP with extended pelvic lymph node dissection (ePLND) in a prolonged extreme Trendelenburg position can cause positioning injuries and rhabdomyolysis.  Patients and methods:   We performed a prospective study of the first 60 patients undergoing RARP and ePLND for organ-confined prostate cancer at our institute. Positioning injuries were graded according to three degrees of clinical severity. Serum-CK, serum-pH, and base excess (BE) were measured before, during, and for 5 days after surgery. Rhabdomyolysis was defined by serum-CK levels >5000 IU/L.  Results:   Median operative time was 317 minutes (range 200-475 min); median time in the Trendelenburg position was 282 minutes (range 170-470 min). Serum-CK was significantly elevated 6 hours postoperatively, peaking at 18 hours postoperatively. Serum-CK levels did not correlate with pH, BE, and perioperative creatinine values. Serum-CK course shows weak correlation with body mass index (BMI), operative time, Trendelenburg position time, and medium correlation with positioning injuries of any degree. Twenty-one of the 60 (35%) patients showed positioning-related injuries: 16 (27%) patients degree I, 2 (3%) patients degree II, and 3 (5%) patients degree III. Rhabdomyolysis developed in 10 patients. Postoperative renal failure did not develop in any patient receiving postoperative hypervolemic diuretic therapy nor any patient with injuries degrees I, II, or III. conclusion: Clinically relevant positioning injuries and rhabdomyolysis can occur in patients who are subjected to prolonged extreme Trendelenburg position during RARP and ePLND, especially at the beginning of the learning curve. Serum-CK increases significantly after surgery, peaking 18 hours postoperatively. Serum-CK elevation alone is not predictive of positioning injury. By very long operative and Trendelenburg times as well as high BMI with visible position injuries, we recommend serum-CK measurement 6 and 18 hours postoperatively followed by hypervolemic therapy to prevent possible renal injury from rhabdomyolysis if serum-CK >5000 IU/L.""","""['Agostino Mattei', 'Giovanni Battista Di Pierro', 'Verena Rafeld', 'Christoph Konrad', 'Jonas Beutler', 'Hansjörg Danuser']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Endourol""","""['Impact of a single-surgeon learning curve on complications, positioning injuries, and renal function in patients undergoing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy and extended pelvic lymph node dissection.', 'Extended pelvic lymphadenectomy and various radical prostatectomy techniques: is pelvic drainage necessary?', 'Standardized and simplified extended pelvic lymph node dissection during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: the monoblock technique.', 'Rhabdomyolysis after radical nephrectomy in the lateral decubitus position: report of 2 cases.', 'Rhabdomyolysis and acute renal failure following radical perineal prostatectomy.', 'Gluteal Compartment Syndrome and Rhabdomyolysis after Prolonged Laparoscopic Nephroureterectomy and Treatment Strategies Including Rehabilitation: A Case Report.', 'Well-Leg Compartment Syndrome After Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy in the Galdakao-Modified Supine Valdivia Position.', 'Creatine kinase elevation after robotic surgery for rectal cancer due to a prolonged lithotomy position.', 'Patient positioning during minimally invasive surgery: what is current best practice?', 'Complications in robotic urological surgeries and how to avoid them: A systematic review.']"""

Colloidal nanotechnologies can provide tremendous enhancements to existing targeting/treatment strategies for prostate cancer to which malignant cells are less sensitive.

These nanoparticles selectively accumulated in hormone-insensitive and chemotherapy-resistant prostate cancer cells, bound androgen receptor with multivalent affinity, and exhibited greatly enhanced drug potency versus monovalent antiandrogens currently in clinical use. Further, antiandrogen gold nanoparticles selectively stimulated GPRC6A with multivalent affinity, demonstrating that the delivery of nanoscale antiandrogens can also be facilitated by the transmembrane receptor in order to realize increasingly selective, increasingly potent therapy for treatment-resistant prostate cancers.""","""['Erik C Dreaden', 'Berkley E Gryder', 'Lauren A Austin', 'Brice A Tene Defo', 'Steven C Hayden', 'Min Pi', 'L Darryl Quarles', 'Adegboyega K Oyelere', 'Mostafa A El-Sayed']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Bioconjug Chem""","""['Identification of a potent antiandrogen that targets the BF3 site of the androgen receptor and inhibits enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Improvement in Therapeutic Efficacy and Reduction in Cellular Toxicity: Introduction of a Novel Anti-PSMA-Conjugated Hybrid Antiandrogen Nanoparticle.', 'Exploitation of the Androgen Receptor to Overcome Taxane Resistance in Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'Multivalent Peptoid Conjugates Which Overcome Enzalutamide Resistance in Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Antiandrogens in prostate cancer.', 'Synthesis, bioactivity, and molecular docking of novel arylpiperazine derivatives as potential AR antagonists.', 'Undercarboxylated, But Not Carboxylated, Osteocalcin Suppresses TNF-α-Induced Inflammatory Signaling Pathway in Myoblasts.', 'First principle simulation of coated hydroxychloroquine on Ag, Au and Pt nanoparticles.', 'Potential and Applications of Nanocarriers for Efficient Delivery of Biopharmaceuticals.', 'Surface-functionalised hybrid nanoparticles for targeted treatment of cancer.']"""

Methods:   The patient sample (N = 788) was taken from a prospective follow-up study of a population-based cohort. Participants included 343 African American and 445 Caucasian-American patients with clinically localized prostate cancer. Multinomial logistic regression was used to investigate relations between the explanatory variables and the nominal 3-level decision-making variable: patient-only, patient-physician shared, and physician-only.  Results:   Approximately 41% of patients reported patient-only decision-making, 45% reported shared decision-making, and 13% reported physician-only decision-making. The odds of patient-only over physician-only decision-making were greater for younger men (vs those aged ≥ 65 years) (odds ratio [OR], 1.68; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.03-2.74), and were less for men with high (vs low) cancer aggressiveness (OR,0.29; 95% CI, 0.15-0.55).

Conclusions:   The findings of the current study indicate that, to facilitate a more patient-oriented decision-making process regarding treatment in those with clinically localized prostate cancer, clinicians need to tailor their interventions according to patient age and cancer aggressiveness, help reduce patient concerns and misconceptions regarding the physical impact of treatments, allow sufficient time for patients to consider treatment options, and assist patients in balancing advice and information received from different sources.""","""['Lixin Song', 'Ronald C Chen', 'Jeannette T Bensen', 'George J Knafl', 'Matthew E Nielsen', 'Laura Farnan', 'Eric M Wallen', 'Merle Mishel', 'Raj S Pruthi', 'James L Mohler', 'Paul A Godley']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Cancer""","""['Quality of physician-patient relationships is associated with the influence of physician treatment recommendations among patients with prostate cancer who chose active surveillance.', 'Elderly prostate cancer patients: patient information and shared decision making.', 'Satisfaction with Care Among Men with Localised Prostate Cancer: A Nationwide Population-based Study.', 'Current decision-making in prostate cancer therapy.', 'New technology in prostate cancer and financial toxicity.', 'Diabetes mellitus lowers the chance of short-term urinary continence recovery in prostate cancer patients undergoing radical prostatectomy.', 'How are patient-related characteristics associated with shared decision-making about treatment?

Recently, we demonstrated that a noscapinoid member, reduced bromonoscapine, (S)-3-(R)-9-bromo-5-(4,5-dimethoxy-1,3-dihydroisobenzofuran-1-yl)-4-methoxy-6-methyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-[1,3]dioxolo-[4,5-g]isoquinoline (Red-Br-nos), induces reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated autophagy and caspase-independent death in prostate cancer PC-3 cells. Herein, we show that Red-Br-nos induces ROS-dependent DNA damage that resulted in high-grade CA and SM in PC-3 cells. Unlike doxorubicin, which causes double-stranded DNA breaks and chronic G2 arrest accompanied by 'templated' CA, Red-Br-nos-mediated DNA damage elicits de novo CA during a transient S/G2 stall, followed by checkpoint abrogation and mitotic entry to form aberrant mitotic figures with supernumerary spindle poles. Attenuation of multipolar phenotype in the presence of tiron, a ROS inhibitor, indicated that ROS-mediated DNA damage was partly responsible for driving CA and SM. Although a few cells (∼5%) yielded to aberrant cytokinesis following an 'anaphase catastrophe', most mitotically arrested cells (∼70%) succumbed to 'metaphase catastrophe,' which was caspase-independent. This report is the first documentation of rapid de novo centrosome formation in the presence of parent centrosome by a noscapinoid family member, which triggers death-inducing SM via a unique mechanism that distinguishes it from other ROS-inducers, conventional DNA-damaging agents, as well as other microtubule-binding drugs.""","""['V Pannu', 'P C G Rida', 'A Ogden', 'R Clewley', 'A Cheng', 'P Karna', 'M Lopus', 'R C Mishra', 'J Zhou', 'R Aneja']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Cell Death Dis""","""['Induction of reactive oxygen species-mediated autophagy by a novel microtubule-modulating agent.', 'A novel microtubule-modulating noscapinoid triggers apoptosis by inducing spindle multipolarity via centrosome amplification and declustering.', 'Centrosome-declustering drugs mediate a two-pronged attack on interphase and mitosis in supercentrosomal cancer cells.', ""Let's huddle to prevent a muddle: centrosome declustering as an attractive anticancer strategy."", 'Mitotic spindle multipolarity without centrosome amplification.', 'Targeting TACC3 represents a novel vulnerability in highly aggressive breast cancers with centrosome amplification.', 'Polo-like kinase 4 (Plk4) potentiates anoikis-resistance of p53KO mammary epithelial cells by inducing a hybrid EMT phenotype.', 'Kinesin Family Member C1 (KIFC1) Accelerates Proliferation and Invasion of Endometrial Cancer Cells Through Modulating the PI3K/AKT Signaling Pathway.', 'Tryptone-stabilized gold nanoparticles induce unipolar clustering of supernumerary centrosomes and G1 arrest in triple-negative breast cancer cells.', 'Mitotic Catastrophe Induced in HeLa Tumor Cells by Photodynamic Therapy with Methyl-aminolevulinate.']"""

The treatment success depends on adequate coverage of the target gland with a therapeutic dose, while sparing the surrounding tissue. Since seed implantation is performed under transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) imaging, intraoperative localization of the seeds in ultrasound can provide physicians with dynamic dose assessment and plan modification. However, since all the seeds cannot be seen in the ultrasound images, registration between ultrasound and fluoroscopy is a practical solution for intraoperative dosimetry. In this manuscript, we introduce a new image-based nonrigid registration method that obviates the need for manual seed segmentation in TRUS images and compensates for the prostate displacement and deformation due to TRUS probe pressure. First, we filter the ultrasound images for subsequent registration using thresholding and Gaussian blurring. Second, a computationally efficient point-to-volume similarity metric, an affine transformation and an evolutionary optimizer are used in the registration loop.

This enzyme drives irreversible degradation of sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), a bioactive lipid associated with resistance to therapeutics in various cancers, including prostate adenocarcinoma. In fresh human prostatectomy specimens, a remarkable decrease in SPL enzymatic activity was found in tumor samples, as compared with normal adjacent tissues. A significant relationship between loss of SPL expression and higher Gleason score was confirmed in tissue microarray (TMA) analysis. Moreover, SPL protein expression and activity were inversely correlated with those of sphingosine kinase-1 (SphK1), the enzyme producing S1P. SPL and SphK1 expressions were independently predictive of aggressive cancer on TMA, supporting the relevance of S1P in prostate cancer. In human C4-2B and PC-3 cell lines, silencing SPL enhanced survival after irradiation or chemotherapy by decreasing expression of proteins involved in sensing and repairing DNA damage or apoptosis, respectively. In contrast, enforced expression of SPL sensitized cancer cells to irradiation or docetaxel by tilting the ceramide/S1P balance toward cell death. Interestingly, the S1P degradation products failed to sensitize to chemo- and radiotherapy, supporting the crucial role of ceramide/S1P balance in cancer. Of note, the combination of SPL enforced expression with a SphK1 silencing strategy by further decreasing S1P content made prostate cancer cells even more sensitive to anticancer therapies, suggesting that a dual strategy aimed at stimulating SPL, and inhibiting SphK1 could represent a future approach to sensitize cancer cells to cancer treatments.""","""['Leyre Brizuela', 'Isabelle Ader', 'Catherine Mazerolles', 'Magalie Bocquet', 'Bernard Malavaud', 'Olivier Cuvillier']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Ther""","""['Recent Insight into the Role of Sphingosine-1-Phosphate Lyase in Neurodegeneration.', 'Sphingosine kinase-1 as a chemotherapy sensor in prostate adenocarcinoma cell and mouse models.', 'Products by the sphingosine kinase/sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) lyase pathway but not S1P stimulate mitogenesis.', 'Regulation of cellular sphingosine-1-phosphate by sphingosine kinase 1 and sphingosine-1-phopshate lyase determines chemotherapy resistance in gastroesophageal cancer.', 'Sphingosine-1-phosphate metabolism and intestinal tumorigenesis: lipid signaling strikes again.', 'Recent Insight into the Role of Sphingosine-1-Phosphate Lyase in Neurodegeneration.', 'Developing New Treatment Options for Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer and Recurrent Disease.', 'Sphingosine-1-phosphate-lyase deficiency affects glucose metabolism in a way that abets oncogenesis.', 'Extracellular Lipids in the Lung and Their Role in Pulmonary Fibrosis.', 'Ginsenoside Rg1 exerts anti‑apoptotic effects on non‑alcoholic fatty liver cells by downregulating the expression of SGPL1.']"""

Methods:   For ten patients with localized prostate cancer plans for simultaneous integrated boost were optimized, varying systematically the number of arcs, collimator angle, the maximum delivery time, and the gantry spacing. Homogeneity in clinical target volume, minimum dose in planning target volume, median dose in the organs at risk, maximum dose in the posterior part of the rectum, and number of monitor units were evaluated using student's test for statistical analysis. Measurements were performed with a 2D-array, taking the delivery time, and compared to the calculation by the gamma method.  Results:   Plans with collimator 45° were superior to plans with collimator 0°. Single arc resulted in higher minimum dose in the planning target volume, but also higher dose values to the organs at risk, requiring less monitor units per fraction dose than dual arc. Single arc needs a higher value (per arc) for the maximum delivery time parameter than dual arc, but as only one arc is needed, the measured delivery time was shorter and stayed below 2.5 min versus 3 to 5 min. Balancing plan quality, dosimetric results and calculation time, a gantry spacing of 4° led to optimal results.

The characterisation of early tumour development is of major interest in order to evaluate the efficacy of therapeutic agents. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) based in-vivo characterisation allows visualisation and characterisation of tumour development in early stages prior to manual palpation. Contrast agents for MRI such as superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIOs) and manganese chloride (MnCl2) represent powerful tools for the in-vivo characterisation of early stage tumours. In this experimental study, we labelled prostate cancer cells with MnCl2 or SPIOs in vitro and used 1 T MRI for tracing labelled cells in-vitro and 7 T MRI for tracking in an in-vivo animal model.  Methods:   Labelling of prostate cancer cells CT1258 was established in-vitro with MnCl2 and SPIOs. In-vitro detection of labelled cells in an agar phantom was carried out through 1 T MRI while in-vivo detection was performed using 7 T MRI after subcutaneous (s.c.) injection of labelled cells into NOD-Scid mice (n = 20). The animals were scanned in regular intervals until euthanization. The respective tumour volumes were analysed and corresponding tumour masses were subjected to histologic examination.  Results:   MnCl2in-vitro labelling resulted in no significant metabolic effects on proliferation and cell vitality. In-vitro detection-limit accounted 105 cells for MnCl2 as well as for SPIOs labelling. In-vivo 7 T MRI scans allowed detection of 103 and 104 cells. In-vivo MnCl2 labelled cells were detectable from days 4-16 while SPIO labelling allowed detection until 4 days after s.c. injection. MnCl2 labelled cells were highly tumourigenic in NOD-Scid mice and the tumour volume development was characterised in a time dependent manner. The amount of injected cells correlated with tumour size development and disease progression. Histological analysis of the induced tumour masses demonstrated characteristic morphologies of prostate adenocarcinoma.  Conclusions:   To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study reporting direct in-vitro MnCl2 labelling and 7 T based in-vivo MRI tracing of cancer cells in a model of prostate cancer. MnCl2 labelling was found to be suitable for in-vivo tracing allowing long detection periods. The labelled cells kept their highly tumourigenic potential in-vivo.

In recent years, a non-neuronal role for MeCP2 has emerged in cell growth and proliferation. Mutations in the MeCP2 gene have been reported to determine growth disadvantages in cultured lymphocyte cells, and its functional ablation suppresses cell growth in glial cells and proliferation in mesenchymal stem cells and prostate cancer cells. MeCP2 interacts with lamin B receptor (LBR) and with Heterochromatin Protein 1 (HP1) at the nuclear envelope (NE), suggesting that it could be part of complexes involved in attracting heterochromatin at the nuclear periphery and in mediating gene silencing. The nuclear lamins, major components of the lamina, have a role in maintaining NE integrity, in orchestrating mitosis, in DNA replication and transcription, in regulation of mitosis and apoptosis and in providing anchoring sites for chromatin domains.In this work, we inferred that MeCP2 might have a role in nuclear envelope stability, thereby affecting the proliferation pattern of highly proliferating systems.  Results:   By performing knock-down (KD) of MeCP2 in normal murine (NIH-3 T3) and in human prostate transformed cells (PC-3 and LNCaP), we observed a strong proliferation decrease and a defect in the cell cycle progression, with accumulation of cells in S/G2M, without triggering a strong apoptotic and senescent phenotype. In these cells, KD of MeCP2 evidenced a considerable decrease of the levels of lamin A, lamin C, lamin B1 and LBR proteins. Moreover, by confocal analysis we confirmed the reduction of lamin A levels, but we also observed an alteration in the shape of the nuclear lamina and an irregular nuclear rim.

Pleiotrophin seems to have a significant role in prostate cancer cell growth and to mediate the stimulatory actions of other factors that affect prostate cancer cell functions. However, all studies carried out up to date are in vitro, using different types of human prostate cancer cell lines. The aim of the present work was to study the role of endogenous PTN in human prostate cancer growth in vivo. For this purpose, human prostate cancer PC3 cells were stably transfected with a plasmid vector, bearing the antisense PTN sequence, in order to inhibit PTN expression (AS-PC3). Migration, apoptosis, and adhesion on osteoblastic cells were measured in vitro. In vivo, PC3 cells were s.c. injected into male NOD/SCID mice, and tumor growth, survival rates, angiogenesis, apoptosis, and the number of metastasis were estimated. Pleiotrophin depletion resulted in a decreased migration capability of AS-PC3 cells compared with the corresponding mock-transfected or the non-transfected PC3 cells, as well as increased apoptosis and decreased adhesiveness to osteoblastic cells in vitro. In prostate cancer NOD/SCID mouse xenografts, PTN depletion significantly suppressed tumor growth and angiogenesis and induced apoptosis of cancer cells. In addition, PTN depletion decreased the number of metastases, providing a survival benefit for the animals bearing AS-PC3 xenografts. Our data suggest that PTN is implicated in human prostate cancer growth in vivo and could be considered a potential target for the development of new therapeutic approaches for prostate cancer.""","""['Sotiria Tsirmoula', 'Kostas Dimas', 'Maria Hatziapostolou', 'Margarita Lamprou', 'Panagiota Ravazoula', 'Evangelia Papadimitriou']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Cancer Sci""","""['Binding of pleiotrophin to cell surface nucleolin mediates prostate cancer cell adhesion to osteoblasts.', 'Nitric oxide stimulates migration of human endothelial and prostate cancer cells through up-regulation of pleiotrophin expression and its receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase beta/zeta.', 'Pharmacological Inhibition of NFκB Reduces Prostate Cancer Related Osteoclastogenesis In Vitro and Osteolysis Ex Vivo.', 'Pleiotrophin as a possible new target for angiogenesis-related diseases and cancer.', 'Pleiotrophin promotes perineural invasion in pancreatic cancer.', 'Activated ALK Cooperates with N-Myc via Wnt/β-Catenin Signaling to Induce Neuroendocrine Prostate Cancer.', 'Pleiotrophin: Activity and mechanism.', 'Neural Precursor-Derived Pleiotrophin Mediates Subventricular Zone Invasion by Glioma.', 'Pleiotrophin, the angiogenic and mitogenic growth factor: levels in serum and synovial fluid in rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis : And correlation with clinical, laboratory and radiological indices.', 'Increased Pleiotrophin Concentrations in Papillary Thyroid Cancer.']"""

As such, novel concepts, such as of heterogeneity and signalling pathways, grow exponentially and many mathematical models accommodating the latest knowledge have been proposed. Here, we present a simple mathematical model that exhibits many characteristics of experimental data, using prostate carcinoma cell spheroids under treatment.  Materials and methods:   We have modelled cancer as a two-subpopulation system, with one subpopulation representing a cancer stem cell state, and the other a normal cancer cell state. As a first approximation, these follow a logistical growth model with self and competing capacities, but they can transform into each other by using an autocrine signalling pathway.  Results and conclusion:   By analysing regulation behaviour of each of the system parameters, we show that the model exhibits many characteristics of actual cancer growth curves. Features reproduced in this model include delayed phase of evolving cancer under 17AAG treatment, and bi-stable behaviour under treatment by irradiation. In addition, our interpretation of the system parameters corresponds well with known facts involving 17AAG treatment.

Three evaluation points were defined: E1, immediately before PB; E2, after definitive diagnosis and when RP was scheduled; and E3, on the day of admission for RP.  Results:   Emotional distress was highest before PB, declining significantly until RP (p = 0.02). Symptoms of depression and anxiety were low at all evaluation points, with anxiety rising significantly after cancer diagnosis (p = 0.008). Concerns about postoperative erectile dysfunction and incontinence were registered at all evaluation points. Concerns about the effect on their partnership due to PC were low.

These compounds have previously been shown to have adjunctive antineoplastic activity through their actions as powerful superoxide dismutase mimics, peroxynitrite scavengers, and modulators of cellular redox-based signaling pathways. Strong paramagnetic MRI contrast properties and affinity for cancer cells suggest their potential application as novel diagnostic imaging agents.  Materials and methods:   MRI experiments were performed at 7.0T on a Bruker Biospec horizontal bore scanner. All in-vivo experiments were performed on 12 C57 black mice implanted with RM-9 prostate cancer cells on the hind limb. Two mg/kg of MnTnHex-2-PyP(5+) (n=6) and 8 mg/kg MnTE-2-PyP(5+) (n=6) were administered intraperitoneally 90 minutes before imaging. All the images were collected using a volume coil and processed using Paravision 4.0.  Results:   Phantom studies reveal remarkably high T1 relaxivity changes for both metalloporphyrins, which are twofold to threefold higher than commercially available gadolinium chelates. Observable detection limits using conventional T1-weighted MRI are in the low micromolar range for both compounds.

Initially identified from activated macrophages, the MIC-1 gene may provide a potential link between inflammation and prostate cancer. In this context, we performed MIC-1 expression analysis using mouse prostate tissues to determine whether there was any correlation with age and inflammation. Reverse transcription PCR analysis on RNA samples isolated from prostate lobes from prostate-specific antigen transgenic mice of varying ages revealed that MIC-1 gene expression is extremely low to non-detectable in the prostate tissues obtained from young mice, while its expression increases in the prostate tissues harvested from elderly mice. Increased MIC-1 gene expression in the mouse prostate was found to be associated with an increased level of infiltrating lymphocytes. To confirm this observation, we showed that inflammation-associated cytokines (IL-1β and TNF-α) significantly upregulate the secretion of the MIC-1 protein in a human prostate cancer cell line (LNCaP cells), while cytokines IL-6 and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor were less effective.

Methods:   In 127 patients treated with radical prostatectomy for clinically localized prostate cancer, urinary PCA3 score was quantified using Progensa™ PCA3 assay. Total TV and Gleason patterns' specific tumor volumes (GPTV) were assessed by computer-assisted planimetry. Spearman's rank correlations coefficients (r) were calculated to assess relationships between PCA3 and TV as well as GPTV. Regression analyses were performed to estimate the relationship between PCA3 and TV as well as non-organ confined disease.  Results:   Mean patients' age was 60.8 years. Patients showed a mean PSA level of 8.1 ng/ml and a mean PCA3 score of 68.5. PCA3 was not significantly correlated with TV (r = 0.131, P = 0.142).

Impact of genotypes on IL-6 transcriptional activity was measured using Low Density Arrays.  Results:   A significant increase in IL-6 transcriptional activity in malignant compared to benign prostate tissue supports a role for IL-6 in PCa. The -174G>C variant showed no association with PCa risk, overall survival, or IL-6 transcriptional activity. The -6331 C-allele was significantly associated with an increased risk in the RFPCS (OR = 1.29, 95% CI = 1.08-1.54), but not in the MCCS.

Furthermore, we associate the minor C-allele with a significant decrease in IL-6 transcriptional activity.  Conclusions:   While our study refutes a role for IL-6 -174G>C, it is the first to implicate -6331T>C with PCa risk and poor survival.

Furthermore, an adenocarcinoma component was found in 72.5 % (37 of 51) of neuroendocrine carcinomas, whereas none of the grade 1 and 2 neuroendocrine tumours contained an adenocarcinoma component. In 83 % of neuroendocrine carcinomas, the adenocarcinoma component was positive for alpha-methylacyl-coenzyme A racemase, and both adenocarcinoma and neuroendocrine carcinoma components stained positively in 78 % of these cases. Our results indicate that alpha-methylacyl-coenzyme A racemase is a useful marker for distinguishing between grade 1 (negative) and grade 2 neuroendocrine tumours, and neuroendocrine carcinoma of the stomach (frequently positive). Different patterns of alpha-methylacyl-coenzyme A racemase expression between gastric neuroendocrine tumours and neuroendocrine carcinoma suggest that these might develop via different tumourigenic pathways.""","""['Alexey Annenkov', 'Ken Nishikura', 'Koji Domori', 'Yoichi Ajioka']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Virchows Arch""","""['Relationship between alpha-methylacyl-coenzyme A racemase expression and mucin phenotype in gastric cancer.', 'Prognostic significance of alpha-methylacyl-coA racemase among men with high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia in prostate biopsies.', 'Alpha-methylacyl CoA racemase in pulmonary adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and neuroendocrine tumors: expression and survival analysis.', 'Application of alpha-methylacyl coenzyme A racemase immunohistochemistry in the diagnosis of prostate cancer: a review.', 'Discovery and clinical application of a novel prostate cancer marker: alpha-methylacyl CoA racemase (P504S).', 'Gastric neuroendocrine carcinoma with positive staining for prostate cancer markers including prostate-specific antigen and alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase.', 'Neuroendocrine Carcinomas of the Gastroenteropancreatic System: A Comprehensive Review.', 'Current early diagnostic biomarkers of prostate cancer.', 'Guidelines for biomarker testing in gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms: a national consensus of the Spanish Society of Pathology and the Spanish Society of Medical Oncology.']"""

However, chronic drug exposure may trigger resistance, limiting the utility of mTOR inhibitors.  Methods:   Metastatic potential of PC3 prostate cancer cells, susceptible (PC3(par)) or resistant (PC3(res)) to the mTOR-inhibitor RAD001 was investigated. Adhesion to vascular endothelium or immobilised collagen, fibronectin and laminin was quantified. Motility, migration and invasion were explored by modified Boyden chamber assay. Integrin α and β subtypes were analysed by flow cytometry, western blotting and real-time PCR. Integrin-related signalling, EGFr, Akt, p70S6kinase and ERK1/2 activation were determined.  Results:   Adhesion was reduced, whereas motility, migration and invasion were enhanced in PC3(res). The α2 and β1 integrin subtypes were dramatically elevated, integrins α1 and α6 were lowered, whereas α5 was nearly lost in PC3(res). Activation of the Akt signalling pathway was strongly upregulated in these cells. Treating PC3(par) cells with RAD001 reduced motility, migration and invasion and deactivated Akt signalling.

The long-term objective of this study is to develop a database of prostate models for computerized training.  Methods:   Cryosurgery is typically performed on patients with localized prostate cancer found in stage T3 or earlier. The distribution of key geometric features likely to be found in the prostate at stage T3 is integrated into a 3D prostate template by employing the extended free-form deformation (EFFD) method. The applied scheme combines two steps: pre-selecting a set of geometric parameter values and manipulating the lattice control points until the prostate model meets the desired criteria.  Results:   Examples for model generation are displayed, based on two 3D prostate templates previously obtained from ultrasound imaging. These examples include selected cases with unilateral and bilateral stage T3 tumor growth, suitable for incorporation into a training database.  Conclusions:   EFFD is an efficient method for rapid generation of prostate models. The compiled criteria for model generation do not lead to a unique shape since the contours for template deformation are randomly selected. Nevertheless, these criteria do lead to shapes resembling cancer growth, as various growth histories can lead to a tumor characterized by the same key parameter values.""","""['Anjali Sehrawat', 'Kenji Shimada', 'Yoed Rabin']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Int J Comput Assist Radiol Surg""","""['The role of exposure time in computerized training of prostate cryosurgery: performance comparison of surgical residents with engineering students.', 'Image-guided prostate cryosurgery: state of the art.', 'Computerized planning of prostate cryosurgery using variable cryoprobe insertion depth.', 'Role of transrectal ultrasonography in the follow-up of patients treated with prostatic cryosurgery.', 'Cryoablation for carcinoma of the prostate.', ""Defeating Cancers' Adaptive Defensive Strategies Using Thermal Therapies: Examining Cancer's Therapeutic Resistance, Ablative, and Computational Modeling Strategies as a means for Improving Therapeutic Outcome."", 'The role of exposure time in computerized training of prostate cryosurgery: performance comparison of surgical residents with engineering students.', 'Computerized Planning of Prostate Cryosurgery and Shape Considerations.', 'A Computerized Tutor Prototype for Prostate Cryotherapy: Key Building Blocks and System Evaluation.', 'GPU-Based Simulation of Ultrasound Imaging Artifacts for Cryosurgery Training.']"""

The simultaneous inhibition of multiple AGC kinases may increase antitumor activity and minimize clinical resistance compared with a single pathway component.  Experimental design:   We investigated the detailed pharmacology and antitumor activity of the novel clinical drug candidate AT13148, an oral ATP-competitive multi-AGC kinase inhibitor. Gene expression microarray studies were undertaken to characterize the molecular mechanisms of action of AT13148.  Results:   AT13148 caused substantial blockade of AKT, p70S6K, PKA, ROCK, and SGK substrate phosphorylation and induced apoptosis in a concentration and time-dependent manner in cancer cells with clinically relevant genetic defects in vitro and in vivo. Antitumor efficacy in HER2-positive, PIK3CA-mutant BT474 breast, PTEN-deficient PC3 human prostate cancer, and PTEN-deficient MES-SA uterine tumor xenografts was shown. We show for the first time that induction of AKT phosphorylation at serine 473 by AT13148, as reported for other ATP-competitive inhibitors of AKT, is not a therapeutically relevant reactivation step. Gene expression studies showed that AT13148 has a predominant effect on apoptosis genes, whereas the selective AKT inhibitor CCT128930 modulates cell-cycle genes. Induction of upstream regulators including IRS2 and PIK3IP1 as a result of compensatory feedback loops was observed.  Conclusions:   The clinical candidate AT13148 is a novel oral multi-AGC kinase inhibitor with potent pharmacodynamic and antitumor activity, which shows a distinct mechanism of action from other AKT inhibitors.

Methods:   The expression of NF-κB subunits and maspin was detected by Western blot analysis in prostate cancer DU145, PC-3, and LNCaP cell lines. RNA interference was performed to analyze whether RelB- or RelA-deletion affectes cell death as well as the expression of NF-κB subunits and maspin. The impact of RelB-silencing in DU145 cells was investigated by flow cytometry. The regulation of RelB on maspin expression in the prostate cancer PC-3 cells was also examined via stable transfection of RelB expression plasmid.  Results:   RelA, p50, RelB, and p52 were constitutively expressed in androgen-independent prostate cancer DU145 and PC-3 cells, while RelB had the highest expression in DU145 cells. Low expression of maspin was detected in LNCaP and DU145 cells, but elevated expression in PC-3 cells. RelB-silencing in DU145 cells by siRNA interference upregulated the endogenous expression of maspin and induced cell apoptosis (13.3±4.2)%. Overexpression of RelB in PC-3 cells inhibited the endogenous expression of maspin. RelA-silecing had no significant influence on the endogenous expression of maspin.  Conclusions:   The classical and alternative NF-κB activitions are sustained in androgen-independent prostate cancer cell lines.

More commonly computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are used although these have limited sensitivities and specificities. The aim of this study was to find out the correlation between higher scrotal uptake ratio (SUR) of (99m)Tc-methylene diphosphonate (MDP) on bone scan and pelvic node metastasis in patients with PC at high risk for nodal metastasis.  Methods:   This was a retrospective study which included 68 biopsy proven newly diagnosed PC patients who had bone scan from January 2008 till January 2012. MRI of the pelvis, prostate specific antigen (PSA) and Gleason's score were available in all patients. Whole body bone scan was performed in all patients and SUR was calculated by dividing mean counts over scrotum and soft tissue over lateral aspect of right thigh. PLND was carried out within 2-3 weeks of MRI study in these patients.  Results:   Mean age of studied males was 71 ± 07 years with a mean PSA level of 65 ± 162 ng/ml. Prostate biopsy revealed adenocarcinoma in all patients with mean Gleason's score 7 ± 1. Mean SUR was 2.786 ± 0.496. MRI was positive for pelvic lymphadenopathy in 32/68 (47 %). PLND revealed evidence of nodal metastasis in 16/68 (24 %) patients. Receiver operating characteristic analysis revealed good diagnostic strength of SUR for nodal metastasis with a cut off value of >2.99 with an area under curve (AUC) 0.708 (95 % CI 0.533-0.847, p value <0.05) and a mean sensitivity of 68.75 % and mean specificity of 80 %. Diagnostic strength of MRI for nodal metastasis was found to be low (AUC 0.566, 95 % CI 0.047-0.657, non-significant p value). No significant correlation was found between SUR and PSA in nodes positive and nodes negative patients.  Conclusion:   We conclude that in newly diagnosed PC patients, higher SUR on bone scan has a high diagnostic accuracy for pelvic node metastasis. Furthermore, a bone scan with a SUR <2.99 and negative for bone metastasis can stratify newly diagnosed PC patients as low risk.""","""['Maseeh Uz Zaman', 'Nosheen Fatima', 'Zafar Sajjad', 'Ibrahim Hashmi', 'Khalil Khan']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Ann Nucl Med""","""['Significance of increased scrotal Tc-99m MDP uptake in patients with prostate cancer.', 'Serum prostate-specific antigen as a predictor of radiographic staging studies in newly diagnosed prostate cancer.', 'Laparoscopic pelvic lymph node dissection allows significantly more accurate staging in ""high-risk"" prostate cancer compared to MRI or CT.', 'A report on the incidence of intestinal 99mTc-methylene diphosphonate uptake of bone scans and a review of the literature.', 'Prostatic specific antigen and bone scan in the diagnosis and follow-up of prostate cancer.

NRP2 is a robust biomarker for predicting response to IGF-IR therapy because prostate carcinomas that express NRP2 exhibit low levels of IGF-IR.

This study determined the effect of growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) antagonists, JMR-132 and JV-1-38 on growth of PC3 tumors as well as on angiogenesis and metastasis through the evaluation of various factors that contribute largely to the progression of prostate cancer. Human PC3 androgen-independent prostate cancer cells were injected subcutaneously into nude mice. The treatment with JMR-132 (10 μg/day) or JV-1-38 (20 μg/day) lasted 41 days. We also evaluated the effects of JMR-132 and JV-1-38 on proliferation, cell adhesion and migration in PC-3 cells in vitro. Several techniques (Western blot, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, immunohistochemistry, ELISA and zymography) were used to evaluate the expression levels of GHRH receptors and its splice variants, GHRH, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1α, metalloproteinases (MMPs) -2 and -9, β-catenin and E-cadherin. GHRH antagonists suppressed the proliferation of PC-3 cells in vitro and significantly inhibited growth of PC3 tumors. After treatment with these analogues, we found an increase in expression of GHRH receptor accompanied by a decrease of GHRH levels, a reduction in both VEGF and HIF-1α expression and in active forms of MMP-2 and MMP-9, a significant increase in levels of membrane-associated β-catenin and a significant decline in E-cadherin. These results support that the blockade of GHRH receptors can modulate elements involved in angiogenesis and metastasis. Consequently, GHRH antagonists could be considered as suitable candidates for therapeutic trials in the management of androgen-independent prostate cancer.""","""['Laura Muñoz-Moreno', 'M Isabel Arenas', 'Andrew V Schally', 'Ana B Fernández-Martínez', 'Elías Zarka', 'Marta González-Santander', 'María J Carmena', 'Eva Vacas', 'Juan C Prieto', 'Ana M Bajo']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Int J Cancer""","""['Anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects of GHRH antagonists in prostate cancer.', 'Combination of GHRH antagonists and docetaxel shows experimental effectiveness for the treatment of triple-negative breast cancers.', 'Dose-dependent growth inhibition in vivo of PC-3 prostate cancer with a reduction in tumoral growth factors after therapy with GHRH antagonist MZ-J-7-138.', 'Antagonists of growth-hormone-releasing hormone: an emerging new therapy for cancer.', 'Growth hormone-releasing hormone: extrapituitary effects in physiology and pathology.', 'miR-425-5p suppresses tumorigenesis and DDP resistance in human-prostate cancer by targeting GSK3β and inactivating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.', 'RNA-Sequencing data supports the existence of novel VEGFA splicing events but not of VEGFAxxxb isoforms.', 'Growth Hormone-Releasing Hormone and Its Analogues: Significance for MSCs-Mediated Angiogenesis.', 'Dissecting major signaling pathways in prostate cancer development and progression: Mechanisms and novel therapeutic targets.', 'Anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects of GHRH antagonists in prostate cancer.']"""

We investigated whether the differential white cell count could predict the result of prostate biopsy.  Methods:   Prostate needle biopsy was carried out in 323 Japanese men with elevated PSA levels or abnormal digital rectal findings. White blood cell count (WBC), differential white cell count (neutrophils, lymphocytes, basophils, eosinophils, and monocytes), and serum C-reactive protein level were assessed for associations with biopsy findings.  Results:   In all, 203 (62.1%) were positive for prostate cancer. WBC, neutrophil count, age, PSA, prostate volume, and PSA density (PSAD) were associated with the results of biopsy (P<0.05). Multivariate analysis showed that neutrophil count, age, PSA, prostate volume and PSAD were independent predictors. When the cut-off neutrophil count was set at 2900 μl(-1), 78 of 104 men (75.0%) with a count below this value had a positive biopsy, while 125 of 219 (57.0%) men with a count above this value were positive. The area under the receiver-operator characteristics curve (AUC) for the predicted probability of a positive biopsy for prostate cancer according to the optimum logistic model was 0.83 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.78-0.87), while the AUC for PSA was 0.70 (95% CI 0.64-0.76) and that for PSAD was 0.79 (95% CI 0.74-0.84).

The majority of these analyses are based on chemoprevention starting in men aged 50-55 years. We sought to evaluate the impact of varying both age at commencement of therapy and length of therapy on the cost-effectiveness of finasteride.  Methods:   A probabilistic Markov model was designed to estimate lifetime prostate health-related costs and quality-adjusted survival for men receiving or not receiving chemoprevention with finasteride. ICERs across scenarios varying age at start of therapy and duration of chemoprevention were compared.  Results:   The ICER for men starting chemoprevention at age 50 and continuing to age 75 was $88 800 per QALY when assuming finasteride causes a constant risk reduction across all tumor grades (base case 1) and $142 300 per QALY when assuming a differential treatment effect according to Gleason score (base case 2). When starting age is increased, the ICERs trend downward and nadir at 65 years to $64 700 per QALY (base case 1) and $118 600 per QALY (base case 2). Altering duration of therapy had minimal impact. Patient-level experiences with finasteride and BPH significantly influenced the cost-effectiveness of chemoprevention.  Conclusions:   Initiating chemoprevention at ages when prostate cancer incidence is higher improves its cost-effectiveness profile.

Although complement and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α potentially exert significant anti-tumour effects, both mediators may also promote tumour progression. It has been demonstrated that sublytic complement confers resistance on tumour cells not only against lytic complement, but also other danger molecules such as perforin. In low concentrations, TNF promotes survival of malignant cells rather than exerting cytotoxic activity. In this study, we tested if sublytic complement is able to interfere with TNF-mediated tumour cell killing. Our results demonstrate that either subcytotoxic concentrations of TNF or sublytic complement rescue prostate carcinoma cells (DU145) from TNF-α-mediated cell death. Upon pretreatment with low-dose TNF-α, but not upon pre-exposure to sublytic complement, TNF resistance was associated with the down-regulation of TNF receptor 1 (TNF-R1) expression. Complement-induced protection against TNF-mediated apoptosis accompanied the induction of anti-apoptotic proteins [B cell leukaemia/lymphoma (Bcl)-2 and Bcl-xL] at an early stage followed by inhibition of the TNF-induced decrease in the amount of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. Cell protection also accompanied the inhibition of caspase-8 activation, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)-1 cleavage and the activation of nuclear factor (NF)-κB.

Because the significance of this polymorphism to cancer risk has been recognized, there are increasing studies investigating -160C/A in different types of cancers and ethnic populations. However, there is still uncertainty about the level of risk for a variety of cancers.  Methods:   To resolve the controversial question raised by these studies as of March 2012 and provide more statistical power for detecting the significance of -160C/A, we performed a meta-analysis of 47 case-control studies in 16 types of cancers (18,194 cases and 20,207 controls). A meta-regression model and subgroup analysis were employed to identify the source of heterogeneity. Publication bias was evaluated, and sensitivity analysis and cumulative evidence assessment were also performed.  Results:   Using fixed- and random-effects models, the -160AA homozygote was more susceptible to urothelial cancer compared with the -160CA heterozygote. Additionally, the -160A allele is an ethnicity-dependent risk factor for prostate and colorectal cancers. Carriers of the -160A allele in Asians and Europeans were more susceptible to prostate cancer, whereas their North American counterparts seemed tolerant. The -160AA homozygote plays a protective role for Europeans who develop colorectal cancer. The stability of these observations was confirmed by a one-way sensitivity analysis. However, the cumulative evidence for all cancer types was considered 'weak' using the Venice guidelines.

Many studies suggest protective effects among smokers and for aggressive prostate cancer, however.  Methods:   We conducted a nested case-control study of serum α-tocopherol and γ-tocopherol and prostate cancer risk in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial, with 680 prostate cancer cases and 824 frequency-matched controls. Multivariate-adjusted, conditional logistic regression models were used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for tocopherol quintiles.  Results:   Serum α-tocopherol and γ-tocopherol were inversely correlated (r = -0.24, p<0.0001). Higher serum α-tocopherol was associated with significantly lower prostate cancer risk (OR for the highest vs. lowest quintile = 0.63, 95% CI 0.44-0.92, p-trend 0.05). By contrast, risk was non-significantly elevated among men with higher γ-tocopherol concentrations (OR for the highest vs. lowest quintile = 1.35, 95% CI 0.92-1.97, p-trend 0.41). The inverse association between prostate cancer and α-tocopherol was restricted to current and recently former smokers, but was only slightly stronger for aggressive disease. By contrast, the increased risk for higher γ-tocopherol was more pronounced for less aggressive cancers.  Conclusions:   Our findings indicate higher α-tocopherol status is associated with decreased risk of developing prostate cancer, particularly among smokers. Although two recent controlled trials did not substantiate an earlier finding of lower prostate cancer incidence and mortality in response to supplementation with a relatively low dose of α-tocopherol, higher α-tocopherol status may be beneficial with respect to prostate cancer risk among smokers.

Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) tend to have weak individual effects but, in combination, they have stronger predictive value. Adipokine pathways have been implicated in the pathogenesis. We used a candidate pathway approach to investigate 29 functional SNPs in key genes from relevant adipokine pathways in a sample of 1006 men eligible for prostate biopsy. We used stepwise multivariate logistic regression and bootstrapping to develop a multilocus genetic risk score by weighting each risk SNP empirically based on its association with disease. Seven common functional polymorphisms were associated with overall and high-grade prostate cancer (Gleason≥7), whereas three variants were associated with high metastatic-risk prostate cancer (PSA≥20 ng/mL and/or Gleason≥8). The addition of genetic variants to age and PSA improved the predictive accuracy for overall and high-grade prostate cancer, using either the area under the receiver-operating characteristics curves (P<0.02), the net reclassification improvement (P<0.001) and integrated discrimination improvement (P<0.001) measures. These results suggest that functional polymorphisms in adipokine pathways may act individually and cumulatively to affect risk and severity of prostate cancer, supporting the influence of adipokine pathways in the pathogenesis of prostate cancer.

Methods:   Five prostate cancer patients with diffusion-weighted MR images were selected for analysis. A two-step VMAT optimization was performed, which consisted of an initial biological optimization of a static gantry angle delivery followed by conversion of the static delivery to a single arc VMAT plan. A dosimetric analysis was performed on the resulting plans.  Results:   The VMAT plans resulted in a ΔEUD between the prostate and the boost volume of between 15.1 Gy and 20.3 Gy. Rectal volumes receiving 75.6 Gy ranged from 4.5 to 9.9%. Expected rectal normal tissue complication probabilities were between 8.6% and 21.4%. Maximum bladder doses ranged from 73.6 Gy to 75.8 Gy. Estimated treatment time was 120 s or less.

Changes in cellular response to the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) cytokine are known to promote epithelial cell invasion and metastasis in part through induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transitions (EMTs). In this report, we demonstrate that non-metastatic human prostate cancer cell lines of increasing Gleason score can be induced to undergo EMT when treated with TGF-β in combination with epidermal growth factor. Mechanistic studies revealed that in cells stably transfected with activated Ras, TGF-β alone induced EMT and that a Ras-Raf-MEK1, but not MEK2, signaling cascade is necessary and sufficient for Erk2 nuclear localization that works in concert with TGF-β to promote EMT. Furthermore, we show for the first time that expression of the transcription factor c-myc, which is phosphorlyated by Erk2, is required for EMT. Characteristically, EMT involved adoption of a spindle-shaped morphology, loss of E-cadherin and increased expression of Vimentin, Fibronectin and Fibroblast Specific Protein-1 (S100A4). Prostate cells undergoing EMT became invasive and expressed several genes associated with metastasis, including MT-MMP1, MMP-2/9, the MMP-9 homodimer, Slug and Twist2.

For example, the efficacy of the common anticancer agent doxorubicin (DOX) is limited by the emergence of multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotype in cancer cells. While dose escalation of DOX can circumvent such resistance to a degree, this is precluded by the appearance of cardiotoxicity, a particularly debilitating condition in children. In vitro studies have established the ability of the natural phytochemical curcumin to overcome MDR; however, its widespread clinical application is restricted by poor solubility and low bioavailability. Building upon our recently developed polymer nanoparticle of curcumin (NanoCurc or NC) that significantly enhances the systemic bioavailability of curcumin, we synthesized a doxorubicin-curcumin composite nanoparticle formulation called NanoDoxCurc (NDC) for overcoming DOX resistance. Compared to DOX alone, NDC inhibited the MDR phenotype and caused striking growth inhibition both in vitro and in vivo in several models of DOX-resistant cancers (multiple myeloma, acute leukemia, prostate and ovarian cancers, respectively). Notably, NDC-treated mice also demonstrated complete absence of cardiac toxicity, as assessed by echocardiography, or any bone marrow suppression, even at cumulative dosages where free DOX and pegylated liposomal DOX (Doxil®) resulted in demonstrable attenuation of cardiac function and hematological toxicities. This improvement in safety profile was achieved through a reduction of DOX-induced intracellular oxidative stress, as indicated by total glutathione levels and glutathione peroxidase activity in cardiac tissue. A composite DOX-curcumin nanoparticle that overcomes both MDR-based DOX chemoresistance and DOX-induced cardiotoxicity holds promise for providing lasting and safe anticancer therapy.""","""['Dipankar Pramanik', 'Nathaniel R Campbell', 'Samarjit Das', 'Sonal Gupta', 'Venugopal Chenna', 'Savita Bisht', 'Polina Sysa-Shah', 'Djahida Bedja', 'Collins Karikari', 'Charles Steenbergen', 'Kathleen L Gabrielson', 'Amarnath Maitra', 'Anirban Maitra']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['Doxorubicin and curcumin co-delivery by lipid nanoparticles for enhanced treatment of diethylnitrosamine-induced hepatocellular carcinoma in mice.', 'A self-assembled polyjuglanin nanoparticle loaded with doxorubicin and anti-Kras siRNA for attenuating multidrug resistance in human lung cancer.', 'Reversibly crosslinked hyaluronic acid nanoparticles for active targeting and intelligent delivery of doxorubicin to drug resistant CD44+ human breast tumor xenografts.', 'Microformulations and Nanoformulations of Doxorubicin for Improvement of Its Therapeutic Efficiency.', 'Multifunctional micelle delivery system for overcoming multidrug resistance of doxorubicin.', 'Integrative Medicine for Ovarian Cancer.', 'Nanotechnology-based diagnostics and therapeutics in acute lymphoblastic leukemia: a systematic review of preclinical studies.', 'Curcumin at Low Doses Potentiates and at High Doses Inhibits ABT-737-Induced Platelet Apoptosis.', 'Protective effects of curcumin on chemical and drug-induced cardiotoxicity: a review.', 'Doxorubicin Hydrochloride-Loaded Nonionic Surfactant Vesicles to Treat Metastatic and Non-Metastatic Breast Cancer.']"""

However, there are few reports on the impact of dose reduction on survival.  Methods:   Fifty-seven patients with CRPC treated with first-line docetaxel in a single institution from 2005 to 2008 were evaluated retrospectively.  Results:   The median follow-up period was 20.5 months. Twenty-eight patients (49 %) received a standard 60 mg/m(2) regimen (SR), and 29 patients (51 %) received an adapted regimen (AR) with dose reduction. There was no difference in their baseline characteristics. The prostate-specific antigen response rates were not significantly different between the SR and AR groups (50 vs. 62 %, p = 0.36). Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were also not significantly different between the groups (PFS 5.3 vs. 7.3 months, p = 0.39; OS 26.4 vs. 27.1 months, p = 0.53, respectively). No significant difference in the incidence of grade 3 or 4 adverse events was noted between the groups (89 vs. 83 %, p = 0.70). In multivariate analysis, hemoglobin and alkaline phosphatase were significant predictive factors for OS (hazard ratios 2.81 and 2.39, p = 0.012 and 0.024, respectively).

We determined the effect of culture conditions (seeding density, serum concentration, type of medium and substrate) on the proportion of each colony type and the cell number of individual colonies, using three prostate cancer cell lines, DU145, LNCaP and PC-3. In less favourable culture conditions, stem cell (SC) colonies tended to be lost; but in more favourable conditions, only modest increases in the proportion of SC colonies were observed. Under some conditions, cell number, but not colony-forming ability, was altered, indicating that colony cell number is controlled, at least in part, by different factors to colony formation. Colony-forming ability of individual cell lines is remarkably stable and there is little evidence for clonal evolution in culture, which might be expected and would result in more aggressive, faster-growing cells.

Although allowing for the delivery of higher doses of radiation to the prostate, its effectiveness compared with the prior standard three-dimensional conformal therapy (3D-CRT) is uncertain.  Objective:   To examine the comparative effectiveness of IMRT relative to 3D-CRT.  Design, setting, and participants:   We performed a population-based cohort study using Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare data to identify men diagnosed with prostate cancer between 2001 and 2007 who underwent either 3D-CRT (n=6976) or IMRT (n=11 039).  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   We assessed our main outcomes (ie, the adjusted use of salvage therapy with androgen-deprivation therapy [ADT] and risk of a complication requiring an intervention) using Cox proportional hazards models.  Results and limitations:   The percentage of men receiving IMRT increased from 9% in 2001 to 93% in 2007. Compared with those treated with 3D-CRT, low-risk patients treated with IMRT had similar likelihoods of using salvage therapy with ADT and similar risks of having a complication requiring an intervention (all p>0.05). Conversely, a subset of higher risk patients treated with IMRT who did not receive concurrent ADT were less likely to use salvage therapy (p=0.02) while maintaining similar complication rates. Because our cohort includes Medicare beneficiaries, our findings may not be generalizable to younger patients.  Conclusions:   For a subset of higher risk patients, IMRT appears to show a benefit in terms of reduced salvage therapy without an increase in complications.

This study investigated the gastrin-releasing peptide expression in breast cancer to demonstrate the role of this biomarker in breast cancer metastasis. Gastrin-releasing peptide was analyzed in breast cancer tissue microarray specimens, including 200 primary breast cancer specimens and the corresponding lymph nodes from the same patients, through immunohistochemistry. The effect of gastrin-releasing peptide on the invasion ability of MCF-7 cells was evaluated using transwell assays. Gastrin-releasing peptide was highly expressed in breast cancer patients with lymph node metastasis. Besides, among the patients with lymph node metastasis, the ones with higher expression of gastrin-releasing peptide had shorter survival time. Overexpression of gastrin-releasing peptide significantly enhanced cell invasiveness.

However, little is known regarding the scope and actual physical integration of such practices. We sought to characterize the emergence of such practices in Texas, their extent of physical integration, and their potential effect on patient travel times for radiation therapy.  Methods and materials:   A telephone survey identified integrated urology-RO practices, defined as practices owned by urologists that offer RO services. Geographic information software was used to determine the proximity of integrated urology-RO clinic sites with respect to the state's population. We calculated patient travel time and distance from each integrated urology-RO clinic offering urologic services to the RO treatment facility owned by the integrated practice and to the nearest nonintegrated (independent) RO facility. We compared these times and distances using the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test.  Results:   Of 229 urology practices identified, 12 (5%) offered integrated RO services, and 182 (28%) of 640 Texas urologists worked in such practices. Approximately 53% of the state population resides within 10 miles of an integrated urology-RO clinic site. Patients with a diagnosis of prostate cancer at an integrated urology-RO clinic site travel a mean of 19.7 miles (26.1 min) from the clinic to reach the RO facility owned by the integrated urology-RO practice vs 5.9 miles (9.2 min) to reach the nearest nonintegrated RO facility (P<.001).  Conclusions:   Integrated urology-RO practices are common in Texas and are generally clustered in urban areas. In most integrated practices, the urology clinics and the integrated RO facilities are not at the same location, and driving times and distances from the clinic to the integrated RO facility exceed those from the clinic to the nearest nonintegrated RO facility.""","""['Pavan M Jhaveri', 'Zhuyi Sun', 'Leslie Ballas', 'David S Followill', 'Karen E Hoffman', 'Jing Jiang', 'Benjamin D Smith']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Effect of practice integration between urologists and radiation oncologists on prostate cancer treatment patterns.', 'The American Society for Radiation Oncology 2017 Radiation Oncologist Workforce Study.', 'Geographic disparities in residential proximity to colorectal and cervical cancer care providers.', 'Multidisciplinary management of prostate malignancy.', 'Development, acceptability, appropriateness and appeal of a cancer clinical trials implementation intervention for rural- and minority-serving urology practices.', 'Value of Geographical Information Systems in Analyzing Geographic Accessibility to Inform Radiotherapy Planning: A Systematic Review.', ""Impact of urologists' ownership of radiation equipment in the treatment of prostate cancer.""]"""

Methods:   Stratified cluster sampling of census tracts in Brooklyn, New York yielded 533 men, aged 45-70 years. The men were classified into the following groups: U.S.-born white, U.S.-born African-American, Jamaican, and Trinidadian/Tobagonian. The subjects completed a written 6-item survey assessing the healthcare barriers.  Results:   Overall, 27% of men reported never having had a PSA test and 28% reported that they had received annual PSA screening. On multivariate analysis, those who viewed the healthcare system as convenient were more likely to report an initial PSA test (odds ratio 1.8, P < .05). Those who perceived difficulty in accessing reliable care were less likely to ever have had a PSA test (odds ratio 0.6, P < .05). Subjects who had not had a comprehensive discussion with their physician about prostate cancer were less likely to have had an initial PSA test and more likely to have maintained annual PSA screening (odds ratio 0.3 and 1.7, respectively, P < .05).  Conclusion:   We identified 2 novel perceived barriers to prostate cancer screening: men who experience the healthcare system as inconvenient were less likely to initiate PSA testing, and those who found it difficult to obtain quality care were less likely to ever have had a PSA test. The perceived system barriers were more closely linked to PSA screening behavior than were the measures assessing perceptions of self-efficacy.

AdΔΔ potentiates apoptotic cell death induced by drugs, including mitoxantrone and docetaxel, which are commonly used to treat prostate cancer. Here, we demonstrate that AdΔΔ can also interact synergistically with dietary phytochemicals known to have anti-cancer activities, without incurring the toxic side effects of chemodrugs. Curcumin, genistein, epigallocatechin-gallate, equol, and resveratrol efficiently killed both androgen-receptor positive (22Rv1) and negative cell lines (PC-3, DU145) in combination with adenoviral mutants. Synergistic cell killing was demonstrated with wild-type virus (Ad5) and AdΔΔ in combination with equol and resveratrol. EC(50) values for both phytochemicals and viruses were reduced three- to eightfold in all three combination-treated cell lines. The most potent efficacy was achieved in the cytotoxic drug- and virus-insensitive PC-3 cells, both in vitro and in vivo, while cell killing in normal bronchial epithelial cells was not enhanced.

Different spacing agents have been tested to reduce incidential radiation exposure of the rectum during radiotherapy to the prostate. These agents all had certain drawbacks; either the created space was too small or the agents used did not stay in place during radiotherapy treatment. The study describes the transperineal injection technique of a spacing agent in detail. Furthermore it shows the safety and efficacy of the spacing hydrogel used and shows that it overcomes some of the drawbacks of the previously examined spacing agents.  Objective:   • To describe the technique used to apply a hydrogel spacer between the prostate and rectum so as to decrease the radiation dose to the rectum in patients with prostate cancer who are undergoing radiotherapy.  Methods:   • A prospective study evaluating the safety and efficacy of prostate-rectum spacer injection was conducted in 29 male patients with prostate cancer scheduled for radiotherapy. • Spacing hydrogel was injected into the perirectal space using a transperineal approach under real-time transrectal ultrasonography guidance. • With the needle tip positioned beyond the rectourethralis muscle, saline injection opened the space between Denonvilliers' fascia and the anterior rectal wall, allowing needle advancement to the mid-prostate without rectal wall injury. Injection of hydrogel precursors further opened this space, which was then maintained as a result of hydrogel polymerization. • Procedure duration and adverse events were monitored. Computed tomography and/or magnetic resonance imaging simulation scans were performed before and after injection. The hydrogel-created space was measured and the reduction in percent volume of the rectum receiving at least 70 Gy (rectal V70) was determined.  Results:   • Hydrogel injection resulted in mean (sd) additional prostate-rectum space relative to baseline of 9.87 (5.92) mm. • The mean (sd) procedure time, as measured by needle insertion and removal, was 6.3 (3.2) min. • The relative reduction in rectal V70 was 60.6%. • There were no unanticipated adverse events associated with the hydrogel procedure or the hydrogel.  Conclusions:   • Hydrogel spacer injection using hydrodissection is a fast and effective procedure to separate the rectal wall from the prostate in order to avoid rectal toxicity. • Hydrogel spacer injection resulted in the addition of ∼1 cm of space • Computed incidental radiation exposure, the rectal V70, was substantially reduced.""","""['Gencay Hatiboglu', 'Michael Pinkawa', 'Jean-Paul Vallée', 'Boris Hadaschik', 'Markus Hohenfellner']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Hydrogel Spacer Prospective Multicenter Randomized Controlled Pivotal Trial: Dosimetric\xa0and Clinical Effects of Perirectal Spacer Application in Men Undergoing Prostate\xa0Image Guided Intensity Modulated Radiation\xa0Therapy.', 'Low rectal toxicity after dose escalated IMRT treatment of prostate cancer using an absorbable hydrogel for increasing and maintaining space between the rectum and prostate: results of a multi-institutional phase II trial.', 'Human collagen injections to reduce rectal dose during radiotherapy.', 'High-dose-rate brachytherapy for prostate cancer in a previously radiated patient with polyethylene glycol hydrogel spacing to reduce rectal dose: case report and review of the literature.', 'Dose-volume analysis of predictors for chronic rectal toxicity after treatment of prostate cancer with adaptive image-guided radiotherapy.', 'Dose Distribution of High Dose-Rate and Low Dose-Rate Prostate Brachytherapy at Different Intervals-Impact of a Hydrogel Spacer and Prostate Volume.', 'New modified technique of hydrogel spacer implantation for prostate cancer: a novel method for separation at the prostate apex level under real-time ultrasound guidance.', 'Dose-escalated radiotherapy to 82\xa0Gy for prostate cancer following insertion of a peri-rectal hydrogel spacer: 3-year outcomes from a phase II trial.', 'Comprehensive review of the use of hydrogel spacers prior to radiation therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Rationale for Utilization of Hydrogel Rectal Spacers in Dose Escalated SBRT for the Treatment of Unfavorable Risk Prostate Cancer.']"""

What's known on the subject? and What does the study add? Surgical margin status at radical prostatectomy (RP) has been shown to be a predictor of disease progression and the strongest predictor of benefit from adjuvant therapy, but the impact of a positive surgical margin (PSM) on long-term prostate-cancer-specific survival is unknown. The PSM rate is dependent on the pathological stage of the cancer. In a recent multicentre nomogram for 15-year prostate-cancer-specific mortality (PCSM) after RP, PSM was not significantly associated with PCSM, while Gleason score and pathological stage were the only significant predictors. This has not been validated in a single centre, and PSM has been shown to vary greatly with surgical technique. This is the first study on the impact of PSM on PCSM in a single surgeon's cohort. In other centres, the decision to administer adjuvant therapy may be influenced by surgical margin status. In this cohort, men routinely did not receive adjuvant therapy, affording the unique opportunity to study the long-term implications of a PSM.  Objective:   • To examine the relative impact of a positive surgical margin (PSM) and other clinicopathological variables on prostate-cancer-specific mortality (PCSM) in a large retrospective cohort of patients undergoing radical prostatectomy (RP).  Patients and methods:   • Between 1982 and 2011, 4569 men underwent RP performed by a single surgeon. • Of the patient population, 4461 (97.6%) met all the inclusion criteria. • The median (range) age was 58 (33-75) years and the median prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was 5.4 ng/mL; RP Gleason score was ≤ 6 in 2834 (63.7%), 7 in 1351 (30.3%), and 8-10 in 260 (6.0%) patients; PSMs were found in 462 (10.4%) patients. • Cox proportional hazards models were used to determine the impact of a PSM on PCSM.  Results:   • At a median (range) follow-up of 10 years (1-29), 187 men (4.3%) had died from prostate cancer. • The 20-year prostate-cancer-specific survival rate was 75% for those with a PSM and 93% for those without. • Compared with those with a negative surgical margin, men with a PSM were more likely to be older (median age 60 vs 58 years) and to have undergone RP in the pre-PSA era (36.6% vs 11.8%). Additionally, they were more likely to have a higher PSA level (median 7.6 vs 5.2 ng/mL), a Gleason score of ≥ 7 (58.7% vs 33.7%), and a non-organ-confined tumour (90.9% vs 30.6% [P < 0.001 for all]). • In a univariate model for PCSM, PSM was highly significant (hazard ratio [HR] 5.0, 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.7-6.7, P < 0.001). • In a multivariable model, adjusting for pathological variables and RP year, PSM remained an independent predictor of PCSM (HR 1.4, 95% CI 1.0-1.9, P = 0.036) with a modest effect relative to RP Gleason score (HR 5.7-12.6) and pathological stage (HR 2.2-11.0 [P < 0.001]).

A bone scan index (BSI) can quantify the extent of bone involvement and response to treatment, but it has not been widely accepted, because of its time-consuming nature. The study is the first to demonstrate that automated BSI calculated with a computer-assisted diagnosis system is effective in judging the chemotherapeutic response of bone metastatic lesions in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer.  Objective:   • To evaluate the value of an automated bone scan index (aBSI), calculated using a computer-assisted diagnosis system, to indicate chemotherapy response and to predict prognosis in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) with bone metastasis.  Patients and methods:   • Forty-two consecutive CRPC patients underwent taxane-based chemotherapy between November 2004 and March 2011 at our institution. • The aBSIs were retrospectively calculated at the diagnosis of CRPC and 16 weeks after starting chemotherapy. • Cox proportional hazards regression models were applied to multivariate analyses with and without aBSI response in addition to the basic model. • Based on the difference in the concordance index (c-index) between each model, the prognostic relevance of adding the aBSI response was determined.  Results:   • A decrease in aBSI was found in 28 patients (66.7%), whereas a response was shown by bone scan in only 23.8% of patients. • Patients with a reduction in aBSI had longer overall survival (OS) in comparison with the other patients (P= 0.0157). • Multivariate analysis without aBSI response showed that performance status (P= 0.0182) and PSA response (P= 0.0375) were significant prognosticators. • By adding the aBSI response to this basic model, the prognostic relevance of the model was improved with an increase in the c-index from 0.621 to 0.660.

Patients and methods:   We have been using a laparoscopic bulldog clamp to control DVC before apical dissection and urethral division. Data of 50 patients who underwent DVC control with laparoscopic bulldog clamp (group 1) were retrospectively compared with 50 consecutive patients in whom DVC was controlled with suture ligation (group 2). In the bulldog and suture groups, 30 and 31 patients underwent concomitant bilateral extended pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND), respectively. Operative and anastomosis time, estimated blood loss (EBL), apical surgical margin positivity, and early continence rates were evaluated.  Results:   Patients in the bulldog group had significantly shorter operative time compared with patients in the suture group (146.8 vs 178.4 min, P=0.0005). Anastomosis time was significantly shorter in the bulldog group (12.3 vs 15.5 min, P=0.002). There was no difference in EBL between the groups (185 vs 184.2 mL). Immediate, postoperative first and third month continence rates were 62% vs 44%, 74% vs 60%, 90% vs 74% in groups 1 and 2, respectively. Although continence rates were better in favor of the bulldog group at each evaluation period, the difference did not reach statistical difference. None of the patients in both groups had apical surgical margin positivity.  Conclusions:   The use of a laparoscopic bulldog clamp to control DVC was associated with shorter operation and anastomosis time and a trend toward quicker recovery of continence. This technique provides clear vision during apical dissection and urethral division while potentially minimizing the external sphincteric trauma.

Methods:   Serum from patients with prostate cancer (n = 24), bladder cancer (n = 24), renal cell carcinoma (n = 24) and control subjects (n = 48) was spiked with cel-miR-39, and then ribonucleic acid was isolated.

Reference gene stability was determined using the NormFinder, geNorm and comparative delta-Ct algorithm. The effect of normalization was tested with miR-21 as the target gene, as this was previously suggested to be upregulated in cancer patients' serum.  Results:   Recovery of cel-miR-39 (mean 11.6%, range 1-56%) was similar in control subjects and cancer patients. SNORD44 and SNORD74A levels were around the detection limit of the assay and were thus omitted. All remaining candidates showed satisfying stability; SNORD43 was the most stable reference gene using all three algorithms. A combination of two genes (SNORD43, RNU1-4) increases the stability somewhat. The level of miR-21 was similar in cancer patients and healthy controls, irrespective of the normalization strategy.

We discovered that ATRA was able to induce the growth arrest and to increase HOXB13 expression in AR(-) prostate cancer cells. Both EZH2 and DNMT3b participated in the repression of HOXB13 expression through an epigenetic mechanism involving DNA and histone methylation modifications. Specifically, EZH2 recruited DNMT3b to HOXB13 promoter to form a repression complex. Moreover, ATRA could upregulate HOXB13 through decreasing EZH2 and DNMT3b expressions and reducing their interactions with the HOXB13 promoter.

Furthermore, in this cell line with respect to LNCaP cells, these changes are synchronous with modifications in both the nuclear distribution of the MAR sequences and in the average loop dimensions that significantly increase. Although the expression of many NM proteins changes during dedifferentiation, only a very limited group of MAR-binding proteins seem to play a key role in this process. Variations in the expression of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and special AT-rich sequence-binding protein-1 (SATB1) along with an increase in the phosphorylation of lamin B represent changes that might trigger passage towards a more aggressive phenotype. These results suggest that elucidating the MAR-binding proteins that are involved in the differentiation of prostate cancer cells could be an important tool to improve our understanding of this carcinogenesis process, and they could also be novel targets for prostate cancer therapy.""","""['Paola Barboro', 'Erica Repaci', ""Cristina D'Arrigo"", 'Cecilia Balbi']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Expression of nuclear matrix proteins binding matrix attachment regions in prostate cancer.

Its effects are mainly mediated by binding to selective phosphoserine/threonine proteins. The importance of 14-3-3 proteins in cancer have only started to become apparent and its exact role in cancer progression as well as the mechanisms by which 14-3-3 proteins mediate cancer cell function remain unknown. While protein 14-3-3σ is widely accepted as a tumor suppressor, 14-3-3ζ, β and γ isoforms have been shown to have tumor promoting effects. Despite the importance of 14-3-3 family in mediating various cell processes, the exact role and mechanism of 14-3-3ζ remain unexplored. In the current study, we investigated the role of protein 14-3-3ζ in prostate cancer cell motility and transendothelial migration using biochemical, molecular biology and electric cell-substrate impedance sensing approaches as well as cell based functional assays. Our study indicated that expression with wild-type protein 14-3-3ζ significantly enhanced Rac activity in PC3 cells. In contrast, expression of dimer-resistant mutant of protein 14-3-3ζ (DM-14-3-3) inhibited Rac activity and associated phosphorylation of p21 activated kinase-1 and 2. Expression with wild-type 14-3-3ζ or constitutively active Rac1 enhanced extracellular matrix recognition, lamellipodia formation, cell migration and trans-endothelial migration by PC3 cells. In contrast, expression with DM 14-3-3ζ or DN-Rac1 in PC3 cells significantly inhibited these cell functions.

Although classical machine learning techniques have successfully been applied to find informative genes and to predict class labels for new samples, common restrictions of microarray analysis such as small sample sizes, a large attribute space and high noise levels still limit its scientific and clinical applications. Increasing the interpretability of prediction models while retaining a high accuracy would help to exploit the information content in microarray data more effectively. For this purpose, we evaluate our rule-based evolutionary machine learning systems, BioHEL and GAssist, on three public microarray cancer datasets, obtaining simple rule-based models for sample classification. A comparison with other benchmark microarray sample classifiers based on three diverse feature selection algorithms suggests that these evolutionary learning techniques can compete with state-of-the-art methods like support vector machines. The obtained models reach accuracies above 90% in two-level external cross-validation, with the added value of facilitating interpretation by using only combinations of simple if-then-else rules. As a further benefit, a literature mining analysis reveals that prioritizations of informative genes extracted from BioHEL's classification rule sets can outperform gene rankings obtained from a conventional ensemble feature selection in terms of the pointwise mutual information between relevant disease terms and the standardized names of top-ranked genes.""","""['Enrico Glaab', 'Jaume Bacardit', 'Jonathan M Garibaldi', 'Natalio Krasnogor']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Accurate molecular classification of cancer using simple rules.', 'A multiple kernel support vector machine scheme for feature selection and rule extraction from gene expression data of cancer tissue.', 'Feature selection and classification of MAQC-II breast cancer and multiple myeloma microarray gene expression data.', 'Filter versus wrapper gene selection approaches in DNA microarray domains.', 'Classification of breast cancer using microarray gene expression data: A survey.', 'DeepGenePrior: A deep learning model for prioritizing genes affected by copy number variants.', ""On the challenges of predicting treatment response in Hodgkin's Lymphoma using transcriptomic data."", 'Clinical Decision Support System for Diabetic Patients by Predicting Type 2 Diabetes Using Machine Learning Algorithms.', 'Utilization of Computer Classification Methods for Exposure Prediction and Gene Selection in Daphnia magna Toxicogenomics.', 'Construction of a multiple-class classifier based on mRNAs and lncRNA FAM66A and PSORS1C3 for predicting distant metastasis in lung adenocarcinoma.']"""

However, its levels are increased also in some non-malignant conditions. In circulation, the majority of PSA is complexed with protease inhibitors, including α(1) -antichymotrypsin (ACT). The proportion of the PSA-ACT complex is higher in patients with prostate cancer than in controls without cancer. The expression of ACT has been shown to be higher in prostate cancer than in benign prostatic hyperplasia. However, results regarding the extent which PSA forms complexes within the prostate and whether there are differences in complex formation between normal and malignant prostatic tissue are inconsistent and limited.  Methods:   We studied complex formation of PSA secreted by cultured human prostate tissues and in the tissue by in situ proximity ligation assay (PLA). Free, total and active PSA, and the PSA-ACT complex were determined in tissue culture media by immunoassays, immunoblotting, and chromatographic methods.  Results:   The majority of PSA in tissue culture medium was free and enzymatically active. However, a significant proportion (1.6 ± 0.5%) of immunoreactive PSA was found to be complexed with ACT. Complex formation was confirmed by in situ PLA, which showed more intense staining of PSA-ACT in cancers with Gleason grade 3 than in adjacent benign tissues from the same patients.

Recent studies have shown that a number of microRNAs (miRNAs) are also epigenetically regulated in different types of cancers including PCa. In this study, we found that the DNA sequence of the promoters of miR-29a and miR-1256 are partly methylated in PCa cells, which leads to their lower expression both in PCa cells and in human tumor tissues compared with normal epithelial cells and normal human prostate tissues. By real-time PCR, Western Blot analysis and miRNA mimic and 3'-UTR-Luc transfection, we found that TRIM68 is a direct target of miR-29a and miR-1256 and that the downregulation of miR-29a and miR-1256 in PCa cells leads to increased expression of TRIM68 and PGK-1 in PCa cells and in human tumor tissue specimens. Interestingly, we found that a natural agent, isoflavone, could demethylate the methylation sites in the promoter sequence of miR-29a and miR-1256, leading to the upregulation of miR-29a and miR-1256 expression. The increased levels of miR-29a and miR-1256 by isoflavone treatment resulted in decreased expression of TRIM68 and PGK-1, which is mechanistically linked with inhibition of PCa cell growth and invasion. The selective demethylation activity of isoflavone on miR-29a and miR-1256 leading to the suppression of TRIM68 and PGK-1 expression is an important biological effect of isoflavone, suggesting that isoflavone could be a useful non-toxic demethylating agent for the prevention of PCa development and progression.""","""['Yiwei Li', 'Dejuan Kong', 'Aamir Ahmad', 'Bin Bao', 'Gregory Dyson', 'Fazlul H Sarkar']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Epigenetics""","""['Epigenetic disruption of miR-130a promotes prostate cancer by targeting SEC23B and DEPDC1.', 'miR-22 and miR-29a Are Members of the Androgen Receptor Cistrome Modulating LAMC1 and Mcl-1 in Prostate Cancer.', 'MicroRNA-27a-5p regulation by promoter methylation and MYC signaling in prostate carcinogenesis.', 'Regulation of miR-200c and miR-141 by Methylation in Prostate Cancer.', 'Epigenetic mechanisms underlying prostate cancer radioresistance.', 'Eight Differential miRNAs in DN Identified by Microarray Analysis as Novel Biomarkers.', 'MiR-29b may suppresses peritoneal metastases through inhibition of the mesothelial-mesenchymal transition (MMT) of human peritoneal mesothelial cells.', 'MicroRNA mediated therapeutic effects of natural agents in prostate cancer.', 'Research advances on epigenetics and cancer metabolism.', 'TRIM68, PIKFYVE, and DYNLL2: The Possible Novel Autophagy- and Immunity-Associated Gene Biomarkers for Osteosarcoma Prognosis.']"""

Methods:   PC-3 and LNCaP cells were exposed to irradiation and/or DHMEQ. Cell viability, cell cycle analysis, western blotting assay, and NF-κB activity were measured. The antitumour effect of irradiation combined with DHMEQ in vivo was also assessed.  Results:   The combination of DHMEQ with irradiation resulted in cell growth inhibition and G2/M arrest relative to treatment with irradiation alone. Inducible NF-κB activity by irradiation was inhibited by DHMEQ treatment. The expression of p53 and p21 in LNCaP, and of 14-3-3σ in PC-3 cells, was increased in the combination treatment. In the in vivo study, 64 days after the start of treatment, tumour size was 85.1%, 77.1%, and 64.7% smaller in the combination treatment group than that of the untreated control, DHMEQ-treated alone, and irradiation alone groups, respectively.

Methods:   Using a microsimulation model, we estimated lifetime probabilities of prostate cancer diagnosis and death, overall life expectancy and expected time to diagnosis, both with and without screening. We calculated anticipated loss in quality of life due to prostate cancer diagnosis and treatment that would be acceptable to decide in favour of screening.  Results:   Men who were screened had a gain in life expectancy of 0.08 years but their expected time to diagnosis decreased by 1.53 life-years. Of the screened men, 0.99% gained on average 8.08 life-years and for 17.43% expected time to diagnosis decreased by 8.78 life-years. These figures imply that the anticipated loss in quality of life owing to diagnosis and treatment should not exceed 4.8%, for screening to have a positive effect on quality-adjusted life expectancy.

We hypothesized that prostate tumor specific epigallocatechin-gallate (EGCg) functionalized radioactive gold nanoparticles, when delivered intratumorally (IT), would circumvent transport barriers, resulting in targeted delivery of therapeutic payloads. The results described herein support our hypothesis. We report the development of inherently therapeutic gold nanoparticles derived from the Au-198 isotope; the range of the (198)Au β-particle (approximately 11 mm in tissue or approximately 1100 cell diameters) is sufficiently long to provide cross-fire effects of a radiation dose delivered to cells within the prostate gland and short enough to minimize the radiation dose to critical tissues near the periphery of the capsule. The formulation of biocompatible (198)AuNPs utilizes the redox chemistry of prostate tumor specific phytochemical EGCg as it converts gold salt into gold nanoparticles and also selectively binds with excellent affinity to Laminin67R receptors, which are over expressed in prostate tumor cells. Pharmacokinetic studies in PC-3 xenograft SCID mice showed approximately 72% retention of (198)AuNP-EGCg in tumors 24 h after intratumoral administration. Therapeutic studies showed 80% reduction of tumor volumes after 28 d demonstrating significant inhibition of tumor growth compared to controls. This innovative nanotechnological approach serves as a basis for designing biocompatible target specific antineoplastic agents.

As a follow-up to the previous report on the decisions made by expert commissions, this paper deals with recent developments and their assessment.  Methods:   The procedures followed for assessment have been extensively described in the previous paper. The criteria for assessment of disputed treatment were and are the accepted standards (i.e. the standards applicable to medical specialists) and the quality of care applied in accordance with the pertinent definitions.  Results:   In the period from 2005 to 2011 (i.e. 7 years) errors in medical treatment were determined in connection with PSA determinations in 22 out of the 37 cases reviewed, i.e. 71%. These were subdivided into 3 cases from general practitioners, 5 cases from specialists in internal medicine and 15 cases from urologists (in 1 case 2 different doctors were involved). They were faulted for omitting a follow-up biopsy of the prostate. In 12 cases this involved PSA values above the recommended cut-off level without suspicious palpation results, in 7 cases raised PSA levels with suspicious palpation findings, in 2 cases suspicious palpation findings without raised PSA and in 1 case the omission of both palpation and PSA determination. An error in treatment was negated if the PSA value was below the recommended cut-off value or had fallen below it again subsequently (two cases each), if follow-up prostate biopsy was recommended and documented following the determination of raised PSA and/or suspicious palpation findings (three cases) or if follow-up treatment was rejected in spite of a documented recommendation (one case).  Conclusions:   Treatment errors in association with PSA determinations can therefore be uniformly and plausibly assessed using objective criteria and can thus be avoided.""","""['V Lent', 'F Baumbusch', 'B Weber']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Urologe A""","""['Treatment errors involving diagnosis using prostate specific antigen.

It has been suggested that targeting intracellular molecules, which have been altered during neoplastic development, may slow tumor growth. Therefore, the growth-blocking potential of the histone deacetylase-inhibitor LBH589 and the multiple tyrosine kinase-inhibitor TKI258, applied alone or in combination, was investigated in a panel of prostate cancer cell lines. PC-3, DU-145 or LNCaP cells were treated with various concentrations of LBH589 and/or TKI258. Tumor cell growth, cell cycle regulating proteins, HDAC3- and HDAC4-expression and histone H3 and H4 acetylation were then evaluated by MTT assay and Western blotting. LBH589 dose-dependently blocked prostate cancer cell growth. In contrast, TKI258 did not down-regulate tumor cell growth up to a 1,000 nM dosage. LBH589 elevated histone H3 and H4 acetylation. The cell cycle regulators cyclin B, cyclin D1, cdk1 and cdk4 were down-regulated in PC-3, whereas the suppressor proteins p21 and p27 were up-regulated in LNCaP by LBH589. TKI258 up-regulated p27 in PC-3 or p21 in LNCaP and additionally elevated cyclin B, cyclin D1, cdk1 and cdk4 in both cell lines. Presumably, the increase in cyclin and cdk caused by TKI258 counteracts the benefit of p21 or p27 up-regulation, resulting in TKI258 non-responsiveness. The LBH589/TKI258-combination was not superior to the LBH589 single-drug use in terms of growth reduction. Obviously, TKI258 did not enhance the sensitivity of prostate cancer cells towards an HDAC based regimen. Therefore, the LBH589/TKI258-combination probably does not provide an optimum strategy in fighting advanced prostate cancer.""","""['Stefan Vallo', 'Jens Mani', 'Matthias Stastny', 'Jasmina Makarević', 'Eva Juengel', 'Igor Tsaur', 'Georg Bartsch', 'Axel Haferkamp', 'Roman A Blaheta']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Invest New Drugs""","""['The HDAC inhibitor LBH589 induces ERK-dependent prometaphase arrest in prostate cancer via HDAC6 inactivation and down-regulation.', 'Effects of Histone Deacetylase Inhibitor Panobinostat (LBH589) on Bone Marrow Mononuclear Cells of Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma Patients and Its Mechanisms.', 'Targeting tumor angiogenesis with histone deacetylase inhibitors: the hydroxamic acid derivative LBH589.', 'Low dose histone deacetylase inhibitor, LBH589, potentiates anticancer effect of docetaxel in epithelial ovarian cancer via PI3K/Akt pathway in vitro.', 'Profile of panobinostat and its potential for treatment in solid tumors: an update.', 'HDAC inhibitors with potential to overcome drug resistance in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Activation of AMPK inhibits TGF-β1-induced airway smooth muscle cells proliferation and its potential mechanisms.', 'Receptor tyrosine kinases: Characterisation, mechanism of action and therapeutic interests for bone cancers.', 'Knockdown of NOB1 expression inhibits the malignant transformation of human prostate cancer cells.', 'Targeting fibroblast growth factor pathways in prostate cancer.']"""

Results:   Increasing doses of adenovirus expressing human Slug were added to DU-145 cells separately, but there were no significantly difference on expressions of Slug and cyclin D1.

Given recent results from admixture mapping and genome-wide association studies for PCa in AA men, it is clear that many risk alleles are enriched in men with West African genetic ancestry.  Methods:   A total of 77 ancestry informative markers (AIMs) within surrounding candidate gene regions were genotyped and haplotyped using Pyrosequencing in 358 unrelated men enrolled in a PCa genetic association study at the Howard University Hospital between 2000 and 2004. Sequence analysis of promoter region single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to evaluate disruption of transcription factor-binding sites was conducted using in silico methods.  Results:   Eight AIMs were significantly associated with PCa risk after adjusting for age and West African ancestry. SNP rs1993973 (intervening sequences) had the strongest association with PCa using the log-additive genetic model (P=0.002). SNPs rs1561131 (genotypic, P=0.007), rs1963562 (dominant, P=0.01) and rs615382 (recessive, P=0.009) remained highly significant after adjusting for both age and ancestry. We also tested the independent effect of each significantly associated SNP and rs1561131 (P=0.04) and rs1963562 (P=0.04) remained significantly associated with PCa development. After multiple comparisons testing using the false discovery rate, rs1993973 remained significant. Analysis of the rs156113-, rs1963562-rs615382l and rs1993973-rs585224 haplotypes revealed that the least frequently found haplotypes in this population were significantly associated with a decreased risk of PCa (P=0.032 and 0.0017, respectively).

The aim of the study was to evaluate the oncologic outcomes of patients treated with ELRP in China.  Methods:   From January 2005 to March 2010, a total of 152 consecutive patients diagnosed with clinically localized prostate cancer were included in this study and treated with ELRP. The patients were staged according to the TNM (tumor, nodes, metastases) system. Median and mean postoperative follow-up were 28.1 months and 27.0 months, respectively. The patients were retrospectively analyzed for progression-free survival.  Results:   One hundred and twelve cases (73.7%) were postoperatively diagnosed as pT2 in, and 40 cases (26.3%) as pT3. Positive lymph nodes were shown in 5 patients (3.3%). Gleason score was < 7 in 49 men (32.2%), 7 in 69 men (45.4%), and > 7 in 34 men (22.4%).

Indole-3-carbinol (I3C) and 3,3'-diindolylmethane (DIM) are phytochemicals derived from cruciferous vegetables that have shown promise in inhibiting prostate cancer in experimental models. Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibition is an emerging target for cancer prevention and therapy. We sought to examine the effects of I3C and DIM on HDACs in human prostate cancer cell lines: androgen insensitive PC-3 cells and androgen sensitive LNCaP cells. I3C modestly inhibited HDAC activity in LNCaP cells by 25% but no inhibition of HDAC activity was detected in PC-3 cells. In contrast, DIM significantly inhibited HDAC activity in both cell lines by as much as 66%. Decreases in HDAC activity correlated with increased expression of p21, a known target of HDAC inhibitors. DIM treatment caused a significant decrease in the expression of HDAC2 protein in both cancer cell lines but no significant change in the protein levels of HDAC1, HDAC3, HDAC4, HDAC6 or HDAC8 was detected. Taken together, these results show that inhibition of HDAC activity by DIM may contribute to the phytochemicals' anti-proliferative effects in the prostate. The ability of DIM to target aberrant epigenetic patterns, in addition to its effects on detoxification of carcinogens, may make it an effective chemopreventive agent by targeting multiple stages of prostate carcinogenesis.""","""['Laura M Beaver', 'Tian-Wei Yu', 'Elizabeth I Sokolowski', 'David E Williams', 'Roderick H Dashwood', 'Emily Ho']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Toxicol Appl Pharmacol""","""[""Broccoli-derived phytochemicals indole-3-carbinol and 3,3'-diindolylmethane exerts concentration-dependent pleiotropic effects on prostate cancer cells: comparison with other cancer preventive phytochemicals."", ""Natural indoles, indole-3-carbinol and 3,3'-diindolymethane, inhibit T cell activation by staphylococcal enterotoxin B through epigenetic regulation involving HDAC expression."", 'Differential effects of sulforaphane on histone deacetylases, cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in normal prostate cells versus hyperplastic and cancerous prostate cells.', 'Indole-3-carbinol and prostate cancer.', 'Review.

These burdens can be estimated in a variety of ways; ""Years of Life Lost"" (YLL) measures the severity of death in regard to the age it occurs, ""Disability-Adjusted Life-Years"" (DALY) estimates the effects of non-lethal disabilities incurred by disease and economic metrics focus on the losses to tax revenue, productivity or direct medical expenses. We compared research funding from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) to a variety of burden metrics for the most common types of cancer to identify mismatches between spending and societal burden.  Methods:   Research funding levels were obtained from the NCI website and information for societal health and economic burdens were collected from government databases and published reports. We calculated the funding levels per unit burden for a wide range of different cancers and burden metrics and compared these values to identify discrepancies.  Results:   Our analysis reveals a considerable mismatch between funding levels and burden. Some cancers are funded at levels far higher than their relative burden suggests (breast cancer, prostate cancer, and leukemia) while other cancers appear underfunded (bladder, esophageal, liver, oral, pancreatic, stomach, and uterine cancers).

Patients and methods:   Between 2006 and 2011, two surgeons performed 904 RALP procedures. LND was performed in 440 (48.6%) cases based on the European Association of Urology guidelines. Both surgeons had extensive experience with open LND for both prostate and bladder cancer. Clinical data were prospectively recorded into an online database. Complications were reported using the Clavien-Dindo system and documented prospectively.  Results:   For both surgeons, the operative time for LND decreased over time during the first 150 LND procedures. After that, a mean plateau of operative time of 49 minutes for LND was reached. Nodal yield increased from a mean of 10 nodes for the first 50 cases to 14 for cases 351 to 400. The percentage of positive nodes increased significantly in these intervals from 4% to 23.1% (P<0.001, Mann Whitney U test). Overall complications by grade were not significantly different between RALP with or without LND. In 440 LND cases, 5 (1.5%) grade IIIb complications occurred. All were infection related with bowel perforation in one. Symptomatic lymphoceles necessitating drainage were present in five (1.5%) men. Thromboembolic events (0% vs 1.5%) and anastomosis dehiscence (0.2% vs 1.1%) were more common in men with LND. During the learning curve, the incidence of Clavien grade I and II but not grade III and IV complications decreased.

Methods:   Sixty-six prostate needle biopsies were analysed prospectively. Serial sections were immunostained with the two- and three- antibody cocktails. Blinded slides were assessed individually by two pathologists and sensitivity, specificity and kappa statistics were calculated.  Results:   Both antibody cocktails contributed to the detection of prostate carcinoma in needle biopsies. There was an acceptable level of agreement between the pathologists for both the cocktails. Sensitivity was similar for one pathologist comparing both the cocktails (76.4% and 75.7%), but was slightly lower comparing the three-antibody with the two-antibody cocktail for the other pathologist (66.6% vs. 77.4%, respectively). Higher specificity values of 90.3% were achieved by both pathologists using three-antibody as compared with two-antibody cocktails (68.7% and 71.8%).  Conclusions:   Antibody cocktails are important in diagnosing prostate carcinoma in needle biopsies. Adding an extra basal cell marker to the traditional two-antibody cocktail improves the specificity of detecting prostate carcinoma in limited needle biopsy material, and should be considered for routine diagnostic use.

A cancer registry was started in 1970, but it was partial and was stopped mainly because no government body was responsible. Realizing the above situation, the Indonesian government established the Sub Directorate of Cancer Control within the Ministry of Health, with responsibility for developing a national cancer control program, including a cancer registry. A sustainable cancer registry was then started in 2007 within Jakarta Province, first hospital-based but then expanded to be population-based. Steps of cancer registration in Jakarta are data collection, data verification, data validation, data management and analysis, and data publication. Data collection is conducted by health facilities (hospitals, laboratories, primary health centers) at the district/municipal level, with reports to the provincial level. Data are collected passively by holding meetings every three months in the district/municipality. Verification of data is the responsibility of the medical doctor or pathologist in each data source. Data validation is conducted by a team in the cancer registry, consisting of district/municipal/province health officers, pathologists, and registrars. Data management and analyses are conducted by a cancer registry team at the provincial level, assisted by the national team. We use software named Indonesian Cancer Registry System (SRIKANDI) which is adopted from CanReg4 IARC. Data from the population-based cancer registry in Jakarta Province showed the leading cancers among females in 2005-2007 to be breast cancer, cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, colorectal cancer and among males are bronchus and lung cancer, colorectal cancer, liver cancer, pharyngeal cancer, and prostate cancer.

Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was applied for mRNA expression of mPGES-1 and Beclin-1, while MTT assays were used to ascertain the best working concentration of the mPGES-1 inhibitor (CAY10526). The effect of CAY10526 treatment on expression of Beclin-1 in DU-145 cells was studied using Western blot analysis. Localization of Beclin-1 and mPGES-1 was in endochylema. Significant differences in expression was noted among PCa, BPH and normal issues (P<0.05). Beclin-1 expression inversely correlated with mPGES-1 expression in PCa tissue (P<0.05). CAY10526 could significantly block mPGES-1 expression and the proliferation of DU-145 cells (P<0.05), while increasing Beclin-1 levels (P<0.05). Overexpression of mPGES-1 could decrease the autophagic PCa cell death. Inhibiting the expression of mPGES-1 may lead to DU-145 cell death and up-regulation of Beclin-1.

Materials and methods:   From March 2007 to March 2011, 121 patients with stage T1-T2 prostate cancer underwent transperineal interstitial prostate brachytherapy. Pre-planning was performed 3 weeks prior to implantation, and the implants were inserted using the standard parallel needle insertion technique. All patients underwent a series of radiographs [chest radiography, kidney-ureter-bladder (KUB) radiography, and a CT scan] to assess whether seed migration had occurred on postoperative days 1 and 30, and 12 months.  Results:   Seed migration occurred in 31 (25.6 %) of 121 patients. A total of 51 of 7,883 (0.65 %) implanted seeds migrated. Migration was detected on postoperative day 1 in 16 patients, day 30 in 13 patients and at 12 months in 4 patients (migration occurred at different times in 2 patients).

However, the emergence of androgen resistance, largely due to inefficient anti-hormone action, limits the therapeutic usefulness of these therapies. Here, we report that 6-(3,4-dihydro-1H-isoquinolin-2-yl)-N-(6-methylpyridin-2-yl)nicotinamide (DIMN) acts as a novel anti-androgenic compound that may be effective in the treatment of both androgen-dependent and androgen-independent prostate cancers. Through AR structure-based virtual screening using the FlexX docking model, fifty-four compounds were selected and further screened for AR antagonism via cell-based tests. One compound, DIMN, showed an antagonistic effect specific to AR with comparable potency to that of the classical AR antagonists, hydroxyflutamide and bicalutamide. Consistent with their anti-androgenic activity, DIMN inhibited the growth of androgen-dependent LNCaP prostate cancer cells. Interestingly, the compound also suppressed the growth of androgen-independent C4-2 and CWR22rv prostate cancer cells, which express a functional AR, but did not suppress the growth of the AR-negative prostate cancer cells PPC-1, DU145, and R3327-AT3.1.

Here, we show that PKD2 and PKD3 promote nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling and urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) expression/activation, which are crucial for prostate cancer cell invasion. Silencing of endogenous PKD2 and/or PKD3 markedly decreased prostate cancer cell migration and invasion, reduced uPA and uPA receptor (uPAR) expression and increased plasminogen activator inhibitor-2 (PAI-2) expression. These results were further substantiated by the finding that PKD2 and PKD3 promoted the activity of uPA and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9). Furthermore, depletion of PKD2 and/or PKD3 decreased the level of binding of the p65 subunit of NF-κB to the promoter of the gene encoding uPA (PLAU), suppressing transcriptional activation of uPA. Endogenous PKD2 and PKD3 interacted with inhibitor of NF-κB (IκB) kinase β (IKKβ); PKD2 mainly regulated the phosphorylated IKK (pIKK)-phosphorylated IκB (pIκB)-IκB degradation cascade, p65 nuclear translocation, and phosphorylation of Ser276 on p65, whereas PKD3 was responsible for the phosphorylation of Ser536 on p65. Conversely, inhibition of uPA transactivation by PKD3 silencing was rescued by constitutive Ser536 p65 phosphorylation, and reduced tumor cell invasion resulting from PKD2 or PKD3 silencing was rescued by ectopic expression of p65. Interestingly, PKD3 interacted with histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1), suppressing HDAC1 expression and decreasing its binding to the uPA promoter. Moreover, depletion of HDAC1 resulted in recovery of uPA transactivation in PKD3-knockdown cells. Taken together, these data suggest that PKD2 and PKD3 coordinate to promote prostate cancer cell invasion through p65 NF-κB- and HDAC1-mediated expression and activation of uPA.""","""['Zhipeng Zou', 'Fangyin Zeng', 'Wanfu Xu', 'Chunxia Wang', 'Zhiyong Ke', 'Q Jane Wang', 'Fan Deng']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""J Cell Sci""","""['Aspirin Inhibits IKK-β-mediated Prostate Cancer Cell Invasion by Targeting Matrix Metalloproteinase-9 and Urokinase-Type Plasminogen Activator.', 'MUC1 protein induces urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) by forming a complex with NF-κB p65 transcription factor and binding to the uPA promoter, leading to enhanced invasiveness of cancer cells.', 'BRMS1 contributes to the negative regulation of uPA gene expression through recruitment of HDAC1 to the NF-kappaB binding site of the uPA promoter.', ""Osteopontin: it's role in regulation of cell motility and nuclear factor kappa B-mediated urokinase type plasminogen activator expression."", 'Small Molecule Inhibitors of Protein Kinase D: Early Development, Current Approaches, and Future Directions.', 'Potential role for protein kinase D inhibitors in prostate cancer.', 'Protein Kinase D2 and D3 Promote Prostate Cancer Cell Bone Metastasis by Positively Regulating Runx2 in a MEK/ERK1/2-Dependent Manner.', 'Protein Kinase D3 (PKD3) Requires Hsp90 for Stability and Promotion of Prostate Cancer Cell Migration.', 'Exosomal RNF157 mRNA from prostate cancer cells contributes to M2 macrophage polarization through destabilizing HDAC1.', 'Emerging photodynamic/sonodynamic therapies for urological cancers: progress and challenges.']"""

Patients and methods:   A total of 38 patients at an age of 68 ± 8 years with radiation cystitis following irradiation of prostate cancer were treated with HBO at 2 absolute atmospheric pressures for 90 min daily. The average number of HBO treatment sessions in each patient was 62 ± 12. The follow-up period was 11.6 ± 3.7 years.

The histone methyltransferase MMSET/WHSC1 (Multiple Myeloma SET domain) is overexpressed in a number of metastatic tumors, but its mechanism of action has not been defined. In this work, we found that PCa cell lines expressed significantly higher levels of MMSET compared with immortalized, non-transformed prostate cells. Knockdown experiments showed that, in metastatic PCa cell lines, dimethylation of lysine 36 and trimethylation of lysine 27 on histone H3 (H3K36me2 and H3K27me3, respectively) depended on MMSET expression, whereas depletion of MMSET in benign prostatic cells did not affect chromatin modifications. Knockdown of MMSET in DU145 and PC-3 tumor cells decreased cell proliferation, colony formation in soft agar and strikingly diminished cell migration and invasion. Conversely, overexpression of MMSET in immortalized, non-transformed RWPE-1 cells promoted cell migration and invasion, accompanied by an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Among a panel of EMT-promoting genes analyzed, TWIST1 expression was strongly activated in response to MMSET. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated that MMSET binds to the TWIST1 locus and leads to an increase in H3K36me2, suggesting a direct role of MMSET in the regulation of this gene. Depletion of TWIST1 in MMSET-overexpressing RWPE-1 cells blocked cell invasion and EMT, indicating that TWIST1 was a critical target of MMSET, responsible for the acquisition of an invasive phenotype.

Proline is oxidized to glutamate in the mitochondria, with the rate-limiting step catalyzed by proline dehydrogenase (PRODH). PRODH expression is inducible by p53, leading to increased proline oxidation, reactive oxygen species formation, and induction of apoptosis. Paradoxical to its role in apoptosis, proline also protects cells against oxidative stress. Here we explore the mechanism of proline protection against hydrogen peroxide stress in melanoma WM35 cells. Treatment of WM35 cells with proline significantly increased cell viability, diminished oxidative damage of cellular lipids and proteins, and maintained ATP and NADPH levels after exposure to hydrogen peroxide. Inhibition or siRNA-mediated knockdown of PRODH abolished proline protection against oxidative stress, whereas knockdown of Δ(1)-pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase, a key enzyme in proline biosynthesis, had no impact on proline protection. Potential linkages between proline metabolism and signaling pathways were explored. The combined inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTORC2 eliminated proline protection. A significant increase in Akt activation was observed in proline-treated cells after hydrogen peroxide stress along with a corresponding increase in the phosphorylation of the forkhead transcription factor class O3a (FoxO3a). The role of PRODH in proline-mediated protection was validated in the prostate carcinoma cell line PC3. Knockdown of PRODH in PC3 cells attenuated phosphorylated levels of Akt and FoxO3a and decreased cell survival during hydrogen peroxide stress.

ERα plays a major role in reproductive physiology and behavior, and mediates classic estrogen signaling in such tissues as the uterus, mammary gland, and skeleton. ERβ, however, modulates estrogen signaling in the ovary, the immune system, prostate, gastrointestinal tract, and hypothalamus, and there is some evidence that ERβ can regulate ERα activity. Moreover, ERβ knockout studies and receptor distribution analyses in the CNS suggest that this receptor may play a role in the modulation of mood and cognition. In recent years several ERβ-specific compounds (selective estrogen receptor beta modulators; SERM-beta) have become available, and research suggests potential utility of these compounds in menopausal symptom relief, breast cancer prevention, diseases that have an inflammatory component, osteoporosis, cardiovascular disease, and inflammatory bowel disease, as well as modulation of mood, and anxiety.

SERM-beta1 and 2 are non-proliferative with respect to breast as determined using the MCF-7 breast cancer cell-based assay and non-proliferative in the uterus as determined by assessing the effects of SERM-beta compounds on immature rat uterine weight and murine uterine weight. In vivo SERM-beta1 and 2 are brain penetrant and display dose dependent efficacy in the murine dorsal raphe assays for induction of tryptophan hydroxylase mRNA and progesterone receptor protein. These compounds show activity in the murine forced swim test and promote hippocampal neurogenesis acutely in rats. Taken together these data suggest that ERβ may play an important role in modulating mood and the ERβ specific compounds described herein will be useful tools for probing the utility of an ERβ agonist for treating neuroendocrine-related mood disturbance and menopausal symptoms.""","""['J A Clark', 'S Alves', 'C Gundlah', 'B Rocha', 'E T Birzin', 'S-J Cai', 'R Flick', 'E Hayes', 'K Ho', 'S Warrier', 'L Pai', 'J Yudkovitz', 'R Fleischer', 'L Colwell', 'S Li', 'H Wilkinson', 'J Schaeffer', 'R Wilkening', 'E Mattingly', 'M Hammond', 'S P Rohrer']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Neuropharmacology""","""['Effect of genistein as a selective estrogen receptor beta agonist on the expression of Calbindin-D9k in the uterus of immature rats.', 'Raloxifene induces cell death and inhibits proliferation through multiple signaling pathways in prostate cancer cells expressing different levels of estrogen receptor α and β.', 'Antidepressant effects of ERbeta-selective estrogen receptor modulators in the forced swim test.', 'Lasofoxifene, a next generation estrogen receptor modulator: preclinical studies.', 'Structure-function relationship of estrogen receptors in cardiovascular pathophysiological models.', 'Deciphering the Influence of Estradiol and Estrogen Receptors on Cognitive Function: A Bibliometric Analysis and Emerging Research Trends.', 'Potential Protective Mechanisms of S-equol, a Metabolite of Soy Isoflavone by the Gut Microbiome, on Cognitive Decline and Dementia.', 'Fluoxetine treatment supports predictive validity of the three hit model of depression in male PACAP heterozygous mice and underpins the impact of early life adversity on therapeutic efficacy.', 'Hormonal Regulation of Mammalian Adult Neurogenesis: A Multifaceted Mechanism.', 'Korean Red Ginseng prevents posttraumatic stress disorder-triggered depression-like behaviors in rats via activation of the serotonergic system.']"""

However, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) considerations and their impacts regarding pharmacokinetic modeling of the time-course data continue to represent challenges in the design of DCE-MRI acquisitions. Given that many acquisition parameters can affect the nature of DCE-MRI data, minimizing tissue-specific data acquisition discrepancy (among sites and scanner models) is as important as synchronizing pharmacokinetic modeling approaches. For cancer-related DCE-MRI studies where rapid contrast reagent (CR) extravasation is expected, current DCE-MRI protocols often adopt a three-dimensional fast low-angle shot (FLASH) sequence to achieve spatial-temporal resolution requirements. Based on breast and prostate DCE-MRI data acquired with different FLASH sequence parameters, this paper elucidates a number of SNR and CNR considerations for acquisition optimization and pharmacokinetic modeling implications therein.

Methods and materials:   Between August 1997 and December 2008, 1002 patients were treated to a dose of 86.4 Gy using a 5-7 field IMRT technique. Patients were stratified by prognostic risk group based on National Comprehensive Cancer Network risk classification criteria. A total of 587 patients (59%) were treated with neoadjuvant and concurrent androgen deprivation therapy. The median follow-up for the entire cohort was 5.5 years (range, 1-14 years).  Results:   For low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups, 7-year biochemical relapse-free survival outcomes were 98.8%, 85.6%, and 67.9%, respectively (P<.001), and distant metastasis-free survival rates were 99.4%, 94.1%, and 82.0% (P<.001), respectively. On multivariate analysis, T stage (P<.001), Gleason score (P<.001), and >50% of initial biopsy positive core (P=.001) were predictive for distant mestastases. No prostate cancer-related deaths were observed in the low-risk group. The 7-year prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM) rates, using competing risk analysis for intermediate- and high-risk groups, were 3.3% and 8.1%, respectively (P=.008). On multivariate analysis, Gleason score (P=.004), percentage of biopsy core positivity (P=.003), and T-stage (P=.033) were predictive for PCSM.

Late grade 3 gastrointestinal and genitourinary toxicity was experienced by 7 patients (0.7%) and 22 patients (2.2%), respectively. Of the 427 men with full potency at baseline, 317 men (74%) retained sexual function at time of last follow-up.

The purpose of this study was to estimate an ideal planning margin to account for intrafraction prostate motion as a function of imaging and repositioning frequency in the absence of continuous prostate motion monitoring.  Methods and materials:   For 31 patients receiving intensity modulated radiation therapy treatment, prostate positions sampled at 10 Hz during treatment using the Calypso system were analyzed. Using these data, we simulated multiple, less frequent imaging protocols, including intervals of every 10, 15, 20, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 180, and 240 seconds. For each imaging protocol, the prostate displacement at the imaging time was corrected by subtracting prostate shifts from the subsequent displacements in that fraction. Furthermore, we conducted a principal component analysis to quantify the direction of prostate motion.  Results:   Averaging histograms of every 240 and 60 seconds for all patients, vector displacements of the prostate were, respectively, within 3 and 2 mm for 95% of the treatment time. A vector margin of 1 mm achieved 91.2% coverage of the prostate with 30 second imaging. The principal component analysis for all fractions showed the largest variance in prostate position in the midsagittal plane at 54° from the anterior direction, indicating that anterosuperior to inferoposterior is the direction of greatest motion. The smallest prostate motion is in the left-right direction.  Conclusions:   The magnitudes of intrafraction prostate motion along the superior-inferior and anterior-posterior directions are comparable, and the smallest motion is in the left-right direction. In the absence of continuous prostate motion monitoring, and under ideal circumstances, 1-, 2-, and 3-mm vector planning margins require a respective imaging frequency of every 15, 60, and 240 to account for intrafraction prostate motion while achieving adequate geometric target coverage for 95% of the time.""","""['William Curtis', 'Mohammad Khan', 'Anthony Magnelli', 'Kevin Stephans', 'Rahul Tendulkar', 'Ping Xia']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Day-to-day reproducibility of prostate intrafraction motion assessed by multiple kV and MV imaging of implanted markers during treatment.', 'Effect of body mass index on intrafraction prostate displacement monitored by real-time electromagnetic tracking.', 'Prostate and patient intrafraction motion: impact on treatment time-dependent planning margins for patients with endorectal balloon.', 'Assessment of planning target volume margins for intensity-modulated radiotherapy of the prostate gland: role of daily inter- and intrafraction motion.', 'Organ motion and its management.', 'Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy for Prostate Cancer Using Tomotherapy With Synchrony Fiducial Tracking.', 'Intrafraction motion during CyberKnife® prostate SBRT: impact of imaging frequency and patient factors.', 'Intrafraction Prostate Motion Management for Ultra-Hypofractionated Radiotherapy of Prostate Cancer.', 'Clinical Assessment of Prostate Displacement and Planning Target Volume Margins for Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy of Prostate Cancer.', 'Prostate cancer - Advantages and disadvantages of MR-guided RT.']"""

Drainage and dissemination patterns are not necessarily identical.  Objective:   To present a precise overview of the lymphatic drainage pattern and to correlate those findings with dissemination patterns. We also investigated the relationship between the number of positive lymph nodes (LN+) and resected lymph nodes (LNs) per region.  Design, setting, and participants:   Seventy-four patients with localized prostate adenocarcinoma were prospectively enrolled. Patients did not show suspect LNs on computed tomography scan and had an LN involvement risk of ≥ 10% but ≤ 35% (Partin tables) or a cT3 tumor.  Intervention:   After intraprostatic technetium-99m nanocolloid injection, patients underwent planar scintigraphy and single-photon emission computed tomography imaging. Then surgery was performed, starting with a sentinel node (SN) procedure and a superextended lymphadenectomy followed by radical prostatectomy.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Distribution of scintigraphically detected SNs and removed SNs per region were registered. The number of LN+, as well as the percentage LN+ of the total number of removed LNs per region, was demonstrated in combining data of all patients. The impact of the extent of LND on N-staging and on the number of LN+ removed was calculated.  Results and limitations:   A total of 470 SNs were scintigraphically detected (median: 6; interquartile range [IQR]: 3-9), of which 371 SNs were removed (median: 4; IQR: 2.25-6). In total, 91 LN+ (median: 2; IQR: 1-3) were found in 34 of 74 patients. The predominant site for LN+ was the internal iliac region. An extended LND (eLND) would have correctly staged 32 of 34 patients but would have adequately removed all LN+ in only 26 of 34 patients. When adding the presacral region, these numbers increased to 33 of 34 and 30 of 34 patients, respectively.  Conclusions:   Standard eLND would have correctly staged the majority of LN+ patients, but 13% of the LN+ would have been missed. Adding the presacral LNs to the template should be considered to obtain a minimal template with maximal gain.

To date, there are limited data available on the outcomes of patients diagnosed with low PSA (≤ 4 ng/ml) who underwent RP. This study aimed to evaluate long-term oncological outcomes of patients undergoing RP with preoperative PSA <2.5 and 2.5-4 ng/ml compared with PSA 4.1-10 ng/ml.  Materials and methods:   Data were analyzed from 3,621 men who underwent RP between 1988 and 2010 at our institution. Patients were stratified into 3 PSA groups: <2.5 ng/ml (n = 280), 2.5-4 ng/ml (n = 563), and 4.1-10 ng/ml (n = 2,778). Patient and disease characteristics were compared. Overall, biochemical disease-free (bDFS), and PCa-specific survivals were analyzed and compared between the groups. Multivariable analyses were conducted using proportional hazards model.  Results:   Compared with the 4.1-10 ng/ml PSA group, Gleason score >7, extracapsular extension, and non-organ-confined disease were less common in patients with PSA ≤ 4 ng/ml (all P < 0.001). The incidence of organ-confined disease was similar between the PSA < 2.5 and 2.5-4 ng/ml groups while perineural invasion (P = 0.050) and Gleason score ≥ 7 (P = 0.026) were more common in the 2.5-4 ng/ml PSA group. Estimated 10-year overall and PCa-specific survivals were comparable across all PSA groups, whereas bDFS was significantly lower in PSA 4.1-10 group (P < 0.001). bDFS was not statistically different between PSA <2.5 and 2.5-4 groups (P = 0.300). 10-year bDFS were 59.0%, 70.1%, and 76.4% in PSA 4.1-10, 2.5-4, and <2.5, respectively. For the PSA ≤ 4 ng/ml groups, age, race, margin status, pathologic stage, but not PSA were independent predictors of bDFS, whereas age, pathologic Gleason, and biochemical recurrence were associated with overall survival.  Conclusions:   Long-term oncological outcomes (overall, bDFS, PCa-specific survivals) of patients presenting with low PSA (≤ 4 ng/ml) were excellent in this study. Compared with PSA 4.1-10 ng/ml, patients presenting with PSA ≤ 4 ng/ml had better bDFS outcomes.

Identification of the most important factors affecting overall well-being may allow health care practitioners to target these symptoms and improve patients' quality of life. The purpose of this study was to determine factors most predictive of well-being in advanced cancer patients.  Materials and methods:   Patients referred to the Rapid Response Radiotherapy Program completed the Edmonton Symptom Assessment System (ESAS) at consultation. ESAS scores and demographics were analysed for their predictive ability for well-being via regression analysis of the raw and categorical scores.  Results:   In total, 1439 ESAS assessments were analysed; the median age was 69 years (range 21-95). The most common primary cancers were of the lung (36%), breast (21%) and prostate (18%). Greater distress in all ESAS items, lower Karnofsky performance status (KPS) and referral for bone metastases significantly predicted for worse well-being (all P < 0.0001). However, referral for brain metastases predicted for better well-being. In multivariate analysis, the most predictive factors for worse well-being were lower KPS (P = 0.003) and greater distress in drowsiness (P = 0.01), pain (P < 0.0001), fatigue (P < 0.0001), depression (P < 0.0001) and appetite loss (P < 0.0001). Repeated analyses with categorical scores led to similar results.  Conclusion:   Greater distress in physical and emotional symptoms assessed by ESAS contributes significantly to poorer well-being. Management for patients with advanced cancer should be directed towards these symptoms, as they form the basis for well-being. Although emotional symptoms may be scored lower than physical symptoms by patients, both significantly affect well-being.""","""['K Lien', 'L Zeng', 'L Zhang', 'J Nguyen', 'J Di Giovanni', 'M Popovic', 'R Jamani', 'G Cramarossa', 'S Culleton', 'E Chow']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Clin Oncol (R Coll Radiol)""","""['Frequency of reporting and predictive factors for anxiety and depression in patients with advanced cancer.', 'Symptom distress in patients attending an outpatient palliative radiotherapy clinic.', 'Fatigue in advanced cancer patients attending an outpatient palliative radiotherapy clinic as screened by the Edmonton Symptom Assessment System.', 'A review of the Rapid Response Radiotherapy Program in patients with advanced cancer referred for palliative radiotherapy over two decades.', 'Prediction of breast cancer-related outcomes with the Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale: A literature review.', 'Additional Benefit of Intraoperative Electroacupuncture in Improving Tolerance of Deep Brain Stimulation Surgical Procedure in Parkinsonian Patients.', 'Symptom Burden in Patients With Reduced Performance Status at the Start of Palliative Radiotherapy.', 'Analysis of curative effect of I125 implantation combined with radiofrequency ablation in treating bone metastases.', 'Patient-reported symptoms before palliative radiotherapy predict survival differences.', 'The Edmonton Symptom Assessment System 25\xa0Years Later: Past, Present, and Future Developments.']"""

The amplified detection was achieved by the enhanced precipitation of 4-chloro-1-naphthol (CN) using a higher number of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) molecules attached on MWCNTs. The PSA nanoimmunosensor was fabricated by immobilizing a monoclonal anti-PSA antibody (anti-PSA) on the AuNP-attached thiolated MWCNT on a gold electrode. The sensor surface was characterized using scanning electron microscope, transmission electron microscope, quartz crystal microbalance, and electrochemical techniques. Cyclic and square wave voltammetric techniques were used to monitor the enhanced precipitation of CN that accumulated on the electrode surface and subsequent decrement in the electrode surface area by monitoring the reduction process of the Fe(CN)(6)(3-)/Fe(CN)(6)(4-) redox couple. Under the optimized experimental condition, the linear range and the detection limit of PSA immunosensor were determined to be 1.0 pg/mL to 10.0 ng/mL and 0.40 ± 0.03 pg/mL, respectively.

Results:   Of 337 patients, 317 (94%) answered the questionnaire. The sexual and hormonal summary scores in the EPIC significantly improved during time since radiotherapy (p < 0.001). Current smoking had a negative effect on SF-12 Physical Component Summary (PCS) and the Mental Component Summary (MCS) scores, on EPIC bowel overall bother (OR 7.8; p = 0.003), on EPIC mean urinary incontinence scores, and on the sexual domain. Severe obesity had a negative influence on SF-12 PCS and vitality. Severe obesity also was a negative predictor for moderate-to-severe problems in the EPIC urinary incontinence, and in the hormonal domain. Living alone was associated with lower SF-12 PCS, MCS scores, and SF-12 general health, social functioning, and the EPIC hormonal domain. The stage of disease or the radiation dose had no statistically significant impact on QoL.  Conclusion:   Results showed significant negative associations between smoking, severe obesity and living alone on self-assessed late adverse effects after radiotherapy for prostate cancer.

Prostate cancer generally presents in one of three ways: asymptomatic patients who are screened (usually by a PSA test); men with LUTS who are investigated and undergo prostate biopsy; or patients with symptoms of metastasis such as bone pain. Men can be reassured that the main cause of LUTS is BPH. Only a small proportion of men have LUTS that are directly attributable to prostate cancer. Digital rectal examination (DRE) gives an evaluation of prostate size, which is relevant in particular to BPH management, and along with PSA testing it is one of the only ways of differentiating clinically between BPH and prostate cancer. If a nodular abnormality is present there is around a 50% chance of a diagnosis of prostate cancer being made on biopsy. Raised levels of serum PSA may be suggestive of prostate cancer, but diagnosis requires histological confirmation in almost every case. A normal PSA, PSA density and DRE can give reasonable confidence with regards to excluding clinically significant prostate cancer. BPH is not a known risk factor for prostate cancer, although the two frequently coexist. Age is the strongest predictor of prostate cancer risk, along with family history. BPH is not considered to be a precursor of prostate cancer. It is likely that although BPH may not make prostate cancer more likely to occur, it may increase the chance of diagnosing an incidental cancer.""","""['R T M Chang', 'Roger Kirby', 'B J Challacombe']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Practitioner""","""['Percent free PSA as an additional measure in a prostate cancer screen.', 'The effect of high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia on serum total and percentage of free prostate specific antigen levels.', 'Predictive value of prostate specific antigen density in the detection of prostate cancer in patients with elevated prostate specific antigen levels and normal digital rectal findings or stage A prostate cancer.', 'The utility of serum prostatic-specific antigen in the management of men with benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'The effect of finasteride on prostate specific antigen: review of available data.', 'Role of prostate stem cells and treatment strategies in benign prostate hyperplasia.', 'Economic Evaluation for Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia in Iran: Surgical Treatment or Dutasteride.', 'Does prior surgical interventional therapy for BPH affect the oncological or functional outcomes after primary whole-gland prostate cryoablation for localized prostate cancer?', 'Genome-wide association study identifies a role for the progesterone receptor in benign prostatic hyperplasia risk.', 'Protective effects of combination of Stauntonia hexaphylla and Cornus officinalis on testosterone-induced benign prostatic hyperplasia through inhibition of 5α- reductase type 2 and induced cell apoptosis.']"""

These organelles play an essential role in apoptosis and the production of reactive oxygen species; in addition, mtDNA also reveals the history of populations and ancient human migration. All these events and variations in the mitochondrial genome are thought to cause some cancers, including prostate cancer, and also help us to group individuals into common origin groups. The aim of the present study is to analyze the different haplogroups and variations in the sequence in the mitochondrial genome of a southern European population consisting of subjects affected (n = 239) and non-affected (n = 150) by sporadic prostate cancer.  Methodology and principal findings:   Using primer extension analysis and DNA sequencing, we identified the nine major European haplogroups and CR polymorphisms. The frequencies of the haplogroups did not differ between patients and control cohorts, whereas the CR polymorphism T16356C was significantly higher in patients with PC compared to the controls (p = 0.029). PSA, staging, and Gleason score were associated with none of the nine major European haplogroups. The CR polymorphisms G16129A (p = 0.007) and T16224C (p = 0.022) were significantly associated with Gleason score, whereas T16311C (p = 0.046) was linked with T-stage.

Thus, sialidases are believed to modulate the function of sialoglycoconjugates by desialylation. We previously reported that the membrane-associated mammalian sialidase NEU3, which preferentially acts on gangliosides, is involved in cell differentiation, motility, and tumorigenesis. The NEU3 gene expression is aberrantly elevated in several human cancers, including colon, renal, prostate, and ovarian cancers. The small interfering RNA-mediated knock-down of NEU3 in cancer cell lines, but not in normal cell-derived primary cultures, downregulates EGFR signaling and induces apoptosis. Here, to investigate the physiological role of NEU3 in tumorigenesis, we established Neu3-deficient mice and then subjected them to carcinogen-induced tumorigenesis, using a sporadic and a colitis-associated colon cancer models. The Neu3-deficient mice showed no conspicuous accumulation of gangliosides in the brain or colon mucosa, or overt abnormalities in their growth, development, behavior, or fertility. In dimethylhydrazine-induced colon carcinogenesis, there were no differences in the incidence or growth of tumors between the Neu3-deficient and wild-type mice. On the other hand, the Neu3-deficient mice were less susceptible than wild-type mice to the colitis-associated colon carcinogenesis induced by azoxymethane and dextran sodium sulfate.

In order to identify SCEs with an acceptable type I error rate, better computational approaches should be developed based on reasonable statistics and null distributions. In this article, we propose a new approach named TAGCNA for identifying SCEs in somatic CNAs that may encompass cancer driver genes. TAGCNA employs a peel-off permutation scheme to generate a reasonable null distribution based on a prior step of selecting tag CNA markers from the genome being considered. We demonstrate the statistical power of TAGCNA on simulated ground truth data, and validate its applicability using two publicly available cancer datasets: lung and prostate adenocarcinoma. TAGCNA identifies SCEs that are known to be involved with proto-oncogenes (e.g. EGFR, CDK4) and tumor suppressor genes (e.g. CDKN2A, CDKN2B), and provides many additional SCEs with potential biological relevance in these data.

Methods:   Subjects were recruited from 666 PCa patients and 708 cancer-free controls, and eight SNPs in the PTEN/AKT/mTOR axis were determined by the TaqMan assay.

Mimicking endogenous electric fields in vitro has profound effects on the behaviour of many cell types. Intriguingly, specific cell types migrate cathodally, others anodally and some polarise with their long axis perpendicular to the electric vector. These striking phenomena are likely to have in vivo relevance since one of the determining factors during cancer metastasis is the ability to switch between attractive and repulsive migration in response to extracellular guidance stimuli. We present evidence that the cervical cancer cell line HeLa migrates cathodally in a direct current electric field of physiological intensity, while the strongly metastatic prostate cancer cell line PC-3-M migrates anodally. Notably, genetic disruption of protein serine/threonine phosphatase-1 (PP1) and its regulator NIPP1 decrease directional migration in these cell lines. Conversely, the inducible expression of NIPP1 switched the directional response of HeLa cells from cathodal to slightly anodal in a PP1-dependent manner. Remarkably, induction of a hyperactive PP1/NIPP1 holoenzyme, further shifted directional migration towards the anode. We show that PP1 association with NIPP1 upregulates signalling by the GTPase Cdc42 and demonstrate that pharmacological inhibition of Cdc42 in cells overexpressing NIPP1 recovered cathodal migration. Taken together, we provide the first evidence for regulation of directional cell migration by NIPP1.

We found that dual targeting of the Akt and mTOR signaling pathways with their respective inhibitors, MK-2206 and ridaforolimus (MK-8669), is highly effective for inhibiting CRPC in preclinical studies in vivo using a refined genetically engineered mouse model of the disease. The efficacy of the combination treatment contrasts with their limited efficacy as single agents, since delivery of MK-2206 or MK-8669 individually had a modest impact in vivo on the overall tumor phenotype. In human prostate cancer cell lines, although not in the mouse model, the synergistic actions of MK-2206 and ridaforolimus (MK-8669) are due in part to limiting the mTORC2 feedback activation of Akt. Moreover, the effects of these drugs are mediated by inhibition of cellular proliferation via the retinoblastoma (Rb) pathway.

An in silico search predicted that zinc finger protein 217 (ZNF217) and importin 7 (IPO7) were potential target genes of these miRNAs.

The regulation of the 3'-untranslated regions of the four genes by their respective miRNAs was confirmed by luciferase assays. As expected, the upregulation of ZNF217, hnRNP-K, VEGF-A and IPO7 could be verified at the protein level in the PCa cell lines LNCaP and DU145. ZNF217 and IPO7, which had not yet been studied in PCa, were analyzed in more detail. ZNF217 mRNA is overexpressed in primary PCa samples, and this overexpression translates to an elevated protein level. However, IPO7 was upregulated at the protein level alone. The inhibition of ZNF217 and IPO7 by siRNA resulted in reduced proliferation of the PCa cell lines. ZNF217 could thus be identified as an oncogene that is overexpressed in PCa and affects the growth of PCa cell lines, whereas the function of IPO7 remains to be elucidated in greater detail.""","""['Jaroslaw Szczyrba', 'Elke Nolte', 'Martin Hart', 'Celina Döll', 'Sven Wach', 'Helge Taubert', 'Bastian Keck', 'Elisabeth Kremmer', 'Robert Stöhr', 'Arndt Hartmann', 'Wolf Wieland', 'Bernd Wullich', 'Friedrich A Grässer']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Int J Cancer""","""['GATA3-driven expression of miR-503 inhibits prostate cancer progression by repressing ZNF217 expression.', 'MiR-203 suppresses ZNF217 upregulation in colorectal cancer and its oncogenicity.', 'The proto-oncogene ERG is a target of microRNA miR-145 in prostate cancer.', 'MicroRNAs and prostate cancer.', 'Recent updates on the role of microRNAs in prostate cancer.', 'The Intricate Interplay between the ZNF217 Oncogene and Epigenetic Processes Shapes Tumor Progression.', 'IPO7 promotes pancreatic cancer progression via regulating ERBB pathway.', 'Pancreatic Cancer Progression Is Regulated by IPO7/p53/LncRNA MALAT1/MiR-129-5p Positive Feedback Loop.', 'Increased Nuclear Transporter Importin 7 Contributes to the Tumor Growth and Correlates With CD8 T Cell Infiltration in Cervical Cancer.', 'ZNF217: the cerberus who fails to guard the gateway to lethal malignancy.']"""

Results:   11C-Choline PET was positive in 124/185 cases (65%) (in 22/61 (36%) after RP, 102/124 (82%) after EBRT). In 79 patients a local recurrence was identified, and 45 patients showed locoregional metastases on PET/CT. In 20 cases a proven false-negative PET scan was observed. Positive PET scans were confirmed by histology in 87/124 (70%) cases, by confirmatory imaging in 34/124 (28%) and by clinical follow-up after salvage treatment in 3 (2%) cases. The ROC analysis to detect a recurrence showed significant difference in area under the curve (AUC) of tPSA 0.721(p < 0.001) and PSA velocity 0.730 (p < 0.001). PSA doubling time showed no significant difference with an AUC of 0.542 (p = 0.354). Detection rates are <50% in tPSA <2 ng/ml and/or PSA velocity <1 ng/ml/year.

The aim of this study was to test whether the occurrence of malignant mesothelioma (MM) or pleural plaques (PPs) in the province of Sivas, Turkey, is determined by the proximity of the patient's birthplace to ophiolites and, if so, to establish the magnitude of the risk.  Methods:   The birthplaces of patients with MM or PPs (cases) and patients with prostate or breast cancer (control subjects), diagnosed between 2000 and 2010 and identified through a mandatory cancer registry or from hospital records (PPs), were located on a geologic map, and the nearest distance to ophiolites was measured. The relation of MM or PPs with distance to ophiolites was analyzed by logistic regression. Samples of soil and house plaster were determined by x-ray diffraction.  Results:   Patients with MM (n = 100) or PPs (n = 133) were born significantly nearer to ophiolites (median distance, 4.5 km for men, 0 km for women) than were patients with prostate cancer (n = 161) or breast cancer (n = 139) (median distance, 20 km for both). ORs were 1.6 (men) ( P < .001) and 2.0 (women) ( P < .001) for every 5-km decrease in the distance of birthplace to ophiolites for MM, compared with prostate and breast cancer, respectively.

While the toxicity of other cucurbitacins has been explored in several cancers, little data exist on the effect of DHCF on human cancers, including prostate cancer (PCa). In this study, we explore the level and mechanisms of DHCF toxicity on human PCa cell lines.  Methods:   Human PCa DU145, PC3, and LNCaP cells were treated with graded doses of DHCF in vitro, and anti-proliferative, cytotoxic, and proteomic effects were determined using MTS assay, cell cycle analysis, immunofluorescent staining, and western blotting.  Results:   DHCF inhibited cell growth and induced cell cycle arrest at G(2)/M phase, formation of binucleated cells, and increased levels of apoptosis in all PCa cell lines tested. G-actin depletion, actin aggregation, and rod-like actin fibers, with little effect on microtubule structure, were observed after DHCF treatment. Actin aggregation and cofilin-actin rod formation were highly correlated with rapid and persistent dephosphorylation of cofilin-1 (cofilin). DHCF treatment resulted in upregulation of p21(Cip1) and downregulation of cyclin A in all three PCa cell lines.  Conclusions:   The anti-proliferative activity of DHCF on human PCa cells may be brought about by inducing actin aggregation and cofilin-actin rod formation, leading to cell cycle arrest, cytokinesis failure, and apoptosis.""","""['Shuai Ren', 'Dong-Yun Ouyang', 'Mark Saltis', 'Li-Hui Xu', 'Qing-Bing Zha', 'Ji-Ye Cai', 'Xian-Hui He']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Cancer Chemother Pharmacol""","""['Suppression of human prostate cancer cell growth by ciprofloxacin is associated with cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.', 'Formation of cofilin-actin rods following cucurbitacin-B-induced actin aggregation depends on Slingshot homolog 1-mediated cofilin hyperactivation.', 'Induction of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest by a chalcone panduratin A isolated from Kaempferia pandurata in androgen-independent human prostate cancer cells PC3 and DU145.', 'Biological activities and potential molecular targets of cucurbitacins: a focus on cancer.', 'Cucurbitacins as inducers of cell death and a rich source of potential anticancer compounds.', 'Cucurbitacin IIb Extracted from Hemsleya penxianensis Induces Cell Cycle Arrest and Apoptosis in Bladder Cancer Cells by Regulating Cell Cycle Checkpoints and Mitochondrial Apoptotic Pathway.', 'Modulation of Cytoskeleton, Protein Trafficking, and Signaling Pathways by Metabolites from Cucurbitaceae, Ericaceae, and Rosaceae Plant Families.', 'Pharmacokinetics and Biological Activity of Cucurbitacins.', 'Treatment of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia by Natural Drugs.', 'Natural Compounds in Sex Hormone-Dependent Cancers: The Role of Triterpenes as Therapeutic Agents.']"""

Aim:   The objective of this study is to assess NNT, numbers needed to treat to harm and corresponding confidence intervals for radical prostatectomy (RP) in patients with prostate cancer defined as a PSAV ≤2 ng/ml/year.  Methods:   NNT following RP were estimated in risk groups defined by PSAV using mortality statistics and hazard ratios obtained in a noncontrolled trial. As no suited control group and no appropriate randomized trials were available for doing this calculation and as such trials are unlikely to become available in the near future we have calculated our NNTs as published previously by using relative risk reduction from an earlier randomized trial (RCT) comparing RP with watchful waiting (WW) [Can J Urol 2006;13(suppl 1):48-55].  Results:   For preoperative PSAV >2 ng/ml/year, NNT for RP were estimated at 25, whereas for preoperative PSAV ≤2 ng/ml/year, the estimate was 618. The lower 95% confidence limits (NNTBl) were 9 and 126, respectively (treatment with benefit). The implications emerging from these findings are discussed by comparison with published NNT values from other RCTs. The lower 95% confidence limit for preoperative PSAV ≤2 ng/ml/year was found to be large in comparison.  Conclusion:   The NNT estimate obtained here for PSAV >2 ng/ml/year and its lower 95% confidence interval is comparable to values in other studies on prostate cancer for therapies considered to be effective, while the estimated NNT for patients with PSAV ≤2 ng/ml/year is large in comparison. We conclude that the benefits of RP for localized prostate cancer with preoperative PSAV ≤2 ng/ml/year may be considered small. There are several limitations to our findings, the most important of which lies in the fact that while PSAV remains significantly associated with outcomes, the predictive value of PSA measurements is low. While PSAV >2 ng/ml/year clearly indicates a need for surgery, a PSAV ≤2 ng/ml/year should imply further decision making.""","""['J Scheerer', 'P Kahabka', 'J E Altwein', 'L Weißbach']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Urol Int""","""['Optimal timing, cutoff, and method of calculation of preoperative prostate-specific antigen velocity to predict relapse after prostatectomy: a report from SEARCH.', 'Impact of obesity on the utility of preoperative prostate-specific antigen velocity to predict for relapse after prostatectomy: a report from the SEARCH database.', 'Prostate-specific antigen velocity and prostate cancer gleason grade and stage.', 'Management of localised prostate cancer: watchful waiting, surgery or radiation therapy, depending on the natural course, which is often relatively slow.', 'Radical prostatectomy versus watchful waiting for prostate cancer.', 'Assessment of oligometastasis status of prostate cancer following combined robot-assisted radical prostatectomy and androgen deprivation versus androgen deprivation therapy alone using PSA percentage decline rate.', 'Measuring midkine: the utility of midkine as a biomarker in cancer and other diseases.']"""

In adult tissues, Rab27B is expressed in a wide variety of differentiated secretory epithelial cells, including those lining the salivary gland, gastrointestinal, mammary and prostate tracts.

Altered microRNAs (miRNAs) expression has been found in many cancers, including lung cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer, bladder cancer and colorectal cancer. Many recent studies have demonstrated that aberrant plasma miRNAs were also found in various types of cancers. However the alteration of plasma expression in HNSCC remains unclear. In this present study, the expression profiles of ten miRNAs, let-7a, miR-21, miR26b, miR-34c, miR-99a, miR-133a, miR-137, miR-184, miR-194a, and miR-375, in plasma from 50 patients and 36 healthy subjects were evaluated using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Our results demonstrated that the expression level of miR-21 was significantly up-regulated in plasma samples obtained from HNSCC patients (p < 0.01) than those from healthy subjects, which were in consistent with our finding in HNSCC tissues. A 7.7-fold increase of miR-21 in cancerous parts when compared to their non-cancerous counterparts (p < 0.0001) was observed in HNSCC tissues. In addition, the expression levels of miR-21 and miR-26b were both reduced in post-operative HNSCC patients with good prognosis. In contrast, the concentration of plasma miR-21 and miR-26b stayed high after tumor removal in the expired cases.

Chemotherapy aims to control the number and proliferation of cancer cells, but it does not effectively control the two best-known conditions of the tumor-permissive environment: neoangiogenesis and tolerogenic immunity. Many malignant diseases exhibit poor outcomes after treatment with chemotherapy. Therefore, we investigated the potential benefits of adding an induction regimen of antiangiogenesis and antitumor immunity to chemotherapy in poor outcome disease. In a prospective, randomized trial, we included patients with advanced, unresectable pancreatic adenocarcinomas, non-small cell lung cancer, or prostate cancer. Two groups of each primary condition were compared: group 1 (G1), n = 30, was treated with the standard chemotherapy and used as a control, and group 2 (G2), n = 30, was treated with chemotherapy plus an induction regimen of antiangiogenesis and antitumor immunity. This induction regimen included a low dose of metronomic cyclophosphamide, a high dose of Cox-2 inhibitor, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, a sulfhydryl (SH) donor, and a hemoderivative that contained autologous tumor antigens released from patient tumors into the blood. After treatment, the G2 group demonstrated significantly longer survival, lower blood level of neoangiogenesis and immune-tolerance mediators, and higher blood levels of antiangiogenesis and antitumor immunity mediators compared with the G1 group. Toxicity and quality of life were not significantly different between the groups. In conclusion, in several advanced malignancies of different primary localizations, an increase in survival was observed by adding an induction regimen of antiangiogenesis and antitumor immunity to standard chemotherapy.""","""['Eduardo Lasalvia-Prisco', 'Pablo Goldschmidt', 'Felipe Galmarini', 'Silvia Cucchi', 'Jesús Vázquez', 'Martha Aghazarian', 'Eduardo Lasalvia-Galante', 'Wilson Golomar', 'William Gordon']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Med Oncol""","""['Clinical and pharmacodynamic evaluation of metronomic cyclophosphamide, celecoxib, and dexamethasone in advanced hormone-refractory prostate cancer.', 'A phase I clinical trial of thoracic radiotherapy and concurrent celecoxib for patients with unfavorable performance status inoperable/unresectable non-small cell lung cancer.', 'Biologic markers of angiogenesis: circulating endothelial cells in patients with advanced malignancies treated on phase I protocol with metronomic chemotherapy and celecoxib.', 'COX-2 inhibition and lung cancer.', ""The potential clinical promise of 'multimodality' metronomic chemotherapy revealed by preclinical studies of metastatic disease."", 'Pooled analysis of the clinical benefit of cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors combined with chemotherapy in advanced non-small cell lung cancer.', 'A Review on Nano-Based Drug Delivery System for Cancer Chemoimmunotherapy.', 'Clinical benefit of COX-2 inhibitors in the adjuvant chemotherapy of advanced non-small cell lung cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Modulation of Determinant Factors to Improve Therapeutic Combinations with Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors.', 'Chemotherapy and radiotherapy for advanced pancreatic cancer.']"""

To preserve these functions, surgeons need to pay special attention to the fascial planes and autonomic nerve plexuses.  Objective:   The aim of this study is to describe the locations of autonomic nerves in critical areas and to demonstrate the correct surgical planes for protecting these nerves during total mesorectal excision.  Design and settings:   Macroscopic and microscopic surgical dissections were performed in the anatomy laboratory. The dissections were recorded as video clips.  Methods:   Dissections were performed in accordance with the total mesorectal excision technique down to the pelvic floor on 2 female and 7 male cadavers. Autonomic nerves and related fascias were shown.  Results:   Autonomic nerves can be damaged during total mesorectal excision in 4 crucial areas: around the origin of the inferior mesenteric artery, in front of the promontory, the side walls of the pelvis, and the posterolateral corners of the prostate close to the anterior rectal wall. Fibers extending in front of the aorta and fibers coming from the sympathetic trunks combine to form the inferior mesenteric plexus around the origin of the inferior mesenteric artery. Most of the fibers that form the superior hypogastric plexus were fibers going downward from the inferior mesenteric plexus. The erigent nerves merge with the pelvic plexuses through the fascia of piriformis, which is part of the pelvic parietal fascia.  Limitations:   The number of cadavers should be increased, especially the number of female cadavers.  Conclusions:   The autonomic nerves must be protected during rectal cancer surgery to maintain the patient's quality of life.

We studied the relationships among DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) genotype, DNA methylation, Gleason score, and mortality in two cohorts of prostate cancer patients, previously reported with associations between DNA methylation in GSTP1, APC, and RUNX3 and prostate cancer mortality. Herein, we considered possible causal relationships between the studied variables, assuming that (1) DNMT activity affects tumor tissue methylation, (2) methylation status affects tumor morphology, and thus the Gleason score, and (3) DNA methylation affects mortality via Gleason score.  Methods:   The cohorts comprised 438 patients diagnosed at one Italian pathology ward before 1997, with DNA obtained from paraffin-embedded tumor tissues. The polymorphism rs406193 in the DNMT3b gene was assessed by allele discrimination in real-time PCR. According to the assumed causal model, we analyzed the effects of rs406193 (T carriers vs others) on the Gleason score without adjusting for gene methylation, and the effects of rs406193 on gene methylation and prostate cancer mortality without adjusting for Gleason score.  Results:   We found no evidence of association between T carriers and the number of methylated genes. However, T carriers had reduced risk of a Gleason score 8+ (odds ratio = 0.57, 95 % CI 0.39-0.85), and a hazard ratio of 0.81 (0.61-1.09) of dying from prostate cancer, which would have been erroneously estimated of 0.93 if adjusted for Gleason score.

Validation experiments investigating all three AKT isoforms demonstrated that, unlike in breast cancer, both AKT1 and AKT2 function as negative regulators of cell migration and invasion in PC3 prostate cancer cells. Down-regulation of AKT1 and AKT2, but not AKT3, induced activation of cell surface β1-integrins and enhanced adhesion, migration, and invasion. Silencing of AKT1 and AKT2 also resulted in increased focal adhesion size. Importantly, the mechanisms involved in integrin activity regulation were distinct for the two AKT isoforms. Silencing of AKT1 relieved feedback suppression of the expression and activity of several receptor tyrosine kinases, including EGFR and MET, with established cross-talk with β1-integrins. Silencing of AKT2, on the other hand, induced up-regulation of the microRNA-200 (miR-200) family, and overexpression of miR-200 was sufficient to induce integrin activity and cell migration in PC3 cells.

We explored the direct use of IV in gene expression to identify candidate genes associated with cancer development. We focused on prostate (PCa) and lung (LC) cancers and compared IV in the expression level of genes shown to be cancer related with that in all other genes in the human genome. Compared with all those other genes, cancer-related genes tended to have greater IV in normal tissues and a greater increase in IV during the transition from normal to tumorous tissue. Genes without significantly different mean expression values between tumor and normal tissues but with greater IV in tumor than in normal tissue (note: the DE-based approach completely ignores those genes) had stronger associations with clinically important features like Gleason score in PCa or tumor histology in LC than all other genes were.

The incidence increase began primarily in the mid-1990s. The corresponding mortality rates of PC remained largely unchanged during the entire study period; around 19 per 100,000 person-years. The incidence increase was most pronounced among men aged 60 + years. A clear pattern was also seen for selected birth cohorts, with increasing incidence rates among the youngest cohorts, and the highest relative increase in age-specific incidence rates was seen among men born between 1943 and 1947. The distribution of stage changed from 1998, with an increasing proportion of PC patients with localised disease.  Conclusion:   The observed increase in PC incidence during the period 1993-2009 in Denmark may be attributed primarily to increasing unsystematic use of prostate specific antigen (PSA) testing. The mortality rates remained stable during the same period suggesting that there is not yet any major influence of intensified PSA screening and more frequent use of curatively intended therapy on the overall prognosis of PC.""","""['Malene Outzen', 'Klaus Brasso', 'Nick Martinussen', 'Jane Christensen', 'Anne Tjønneland', 'Søren Friis', 'Anja Olsen']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Acta Oncol""","""['Prostate cancer in Denmark 1943-2002.', 'Trends in survival of patients diagnosed with male genital cancers in the Nordic countries 1964-2003 followed up until the end of 2006.', 'Interpreting trends in prostate cancer incidence and mortality in the five Nordic countries.', 'Patterns and trends in prostate cancer incidence, survival, prevalence and mortality.

Methods:   From November 1994 through January 2002, we randomly assigned 731 men with localized prostate cancer (mean age, 67 years; median PSA value, 7.8 ng per milliliter) to radical prostatectomy or observation and followed them through January 2010. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality; the secondary outcome was prostate-cancer mortality.  Results:   During the median follow-up of 10.0 years, 171 of 364 men (47.0%) assigned to radical prostatectomy died, as compared with 183 of 367 (49.9%) assigned to observation (hazard ratio, 0.88; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.71 to 1.08; P=0.22; absolute risk reduction, 2.9 percentage points). Among men assigned to radical prostatectomy, 21 (5.8%) died from prostate cancer or treatment, as compared with 31 men (8.4%) assigned to observation (hazard ratio, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.36 to 1.09; P=0.09; absolute risk reduction, 2.6 percentage points). The effect of treatment on all-cause and prostate-cancer mortality did not differ according to age, race, coexisting conditions, self-reported performance status, or histologic features of the tumor. Radical prostatectomy was associated with reduced all-cause mortality among men with a PSA value greater than 10 ng per milliliter (P=0.04 for interaction) and possibly among those with intermediate-risk or high-risk tumors (P=0.07 for interaction). Adverse events within 30 days after surgery occurred in 21.4% of men, including one death.  Conclusions:   Among men with localized prostate cancer detected during the early era of PSA testing, radical prostatectomy did not significantly reduce all-cause or prostate-cancer mortality, as compared with observation, through at least 12 years of follow-up.

The CCND1 G870A polymorphism has been associated with an increased susceptibility to squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, bladder, prostate, and gastric cardiac cancers. There are a number of studies that explored the relationship between CCND1 G870A polymorphism and breast cancer risk, with inconsistent conclusions. In order to better define the predictive value of CCND1 G870A polymorphism in breast cancer, we searched PubMed and EBSCO for relevant publications. A total of 13 studies were indentified, which included 11,235 cases and 12,763 controls. We calculated the summary odds ratios and the corresponding 95% confidence interval. Our meta-analysis showed that carriers of AA genotype have a significantly higher risk in developing breast cancer compared with that of GG genotype (OR = 1.08, 95% CI = 1.01-1.17, p > = 0.03) in overall population. Furthermore, in subgroup analysis, CCND1 G870A polymorphism was associated with a marginally increased risk of breast cancer for Chinese compared to Caucasian populations with an OR = 1.14, 95% CI = 1.00-1.20, p-trend = 0.06 for AA + GA versus GG, if the controls were hospital-based population with an OR = 1.21, 95% CI = 0.99-1.47, p = 0.06 for AA versus GG and if the distributions of genotypes in control groups were consistent with the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) with an OR = 1.08, 95% CI = 1.00-1.15, p = 0.04 for AA versus GA + GG. Our meta-analysis represents the largest study to date indicating that the G870A polymorphism in CCND1 confers an increased risk for breast cancer.

The number of cancer cases in this region could double, ranging between 700 000 and 1 600 000 new cases in 2030. The mortality rate is higher than 80% and is explained, mainly, by a lack of early detection, diagnostics and treatment resources. In Angola, about 7,000 patients die of cancer every year.  Methods:   Data were derived from open-ended interviews conducted in 2010-11 with health authorities, clinicians, nurses and Administration of Hospitals. According Angola epidemiological data, results of interviews and international published advocacy for cancer control we develop a potential strategy for its control. The objectives are to identify existing resources for cancer control and describe the needs thereto, in order to establish an oncological program to guide the development of Angola cancer control strategies.  Results:   Malaria remains the leading cause of illness and death in Angola, and other communicable diseases remain a public health problem. However, 9 000 new cases of cancer are diagnosed each year.The most common types of cancer are: cancer of the cervix, breast, prostate, esophagus, stomach and head and neck, as well as cancers with infectious origin, such as Kaposi's sarcoma and liver and bladder cancer. The foundation for developing national cancer control strategies includes: oncological data; investment and training; identifying and removing barriers; guidance and protection of the patient. Angolan National Cancer Centre, Sagrada Esperança Clinic and Girassol Clinic are now developing a cancer program.  Conclusion:   Improving the economic situation of Angola creates conditions for an increase in life expectancy which in itself is associated with an increased risk of oncological diseases. On the other hand, infectious diseases, associated with the risk of malignant tumors, are endemic. Thus, an increase in patients with malignant disease is expected. A plan is therefore necessary to organize the response to this old but less visible nosologic situation.""","""['Lygia Vieira Lopes', 'Ana Vaz Conceição', 'João Blasques Oliveira', 'António Tavares', 'Clarinha Domingos', 'Lucio Lara Santos']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Pan Afr Med J""","""['Stage at presentation of breast cancer in Luanda, Angola - a retrospective study.', 'Establishing of cancer units in low or middle income African countries: Angolan experience--a preliminary report.', 'Italian cancer figures--Report 2015: The burden of rare cancers in Italy.', 'Tuberculosis.', 'Dementia -- Caring, Ethics, Ethnical and Economical Aspects: A Systematic Review Internet.', 'Evaluating Barriers and Opportunities in Delivering High-Quality Oncology Care in a Resource-Limited Setting Using a Comprehensive Needs Assessment Tool.', 'Stage at presentation of breast cancer in Luanda, Angola - a retrospective study.', 'Establishing of cancer units in low or middle income African countries: Angolan experience--a preliminary report.', 'Urinary estrogen metabolites and self-reported infertility in women infected with Schistosoma haematobium.']"""

The aim of this study was to refine the current knowledge about indicators associated with cancer incidence by evaluating the influence of neighbourhood characteristics on breast, prostate and lung cancer incidence in Denmark.  Methods:   All women aged 30-83 years were followed for breast cancer between 2004 and 2008, men between 50 and 83 years were followed for prostate cancer and both sexes between ages 50 and 83 were followed for lung cancer. Registry data obtained from Statistics Denmark included age, sex, availability of breast cancer screening, marital status, education, disposable income and occupational socioeconomic status on the individual level and population density and neighbourhood socioeconomic status (the proportion of unemployed) on the parish level. Frailty modelling with individuals on the first level and parishes on the second level was conducted.  Results:   A significantly lower HR of breast cancer was found in areas with low population density (HR=0.93; CI 0.88 to 0.99), while neighbourhood unemployment had no effect. Inhabitants of lower unemployment areas had a higher risk of prostate cancer (HR=1.14; CI 1.08 to 1.21) compared with those in higher unemployment areas, whereas population density had no effect. Risk of lung cancer was lower in areas with lowest population density (HR=0.80; CI 0.74 to 0.85) and lowest in areas with lowest unemployment (HR=0.88; CI 0.84 to 0.92).

Common polymorphisms in p53 gene may play a role in some cancers. Some studies have reported an association between human papillomavirus (HPV) infections and prostate cancer. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the TP53 codon 72 polymorphism and HPV infection are responsible for susceptibility to prostate cancer in Iranian men. The prostate biopsies were taken during surgery from 68 Iranian prostatic cancer patients, and 85 patients with benign prostate hyperplasia. For genotyping of the p53 polymorphism at codon 72, PCRRFLP methods were used and the PCR products were digested with BstU1. An attempt was also made to detect HPV DNA in benign prostate hyperplasia and prostate cancer specimens. Among cancer cases, the distribution of Arg/Arg, Arg/Pro and Pro/Pro genotypes were 26.5%, 45.4%, and 19.1%, respectively. Among patients with benign prostate hyperplasia, the distribution of Arg/Arg, Arg/Pro, and Pro/Pro genotypes were 27%, 53%, and 20%, respectively. The allele frequencies did not differ significantly between prostate cancer and benign prostate hyperplasia samples. Human papillomavirus was detected only in three patients (4.4%; P = 0.71). The results from this study suggest that the TP53 codon 72 polymorphism and HPV infection do not confer susceptibility to prostate cancer in the Iranian population.

In the present study, we investigated the anti-metastatic activity of MJ-33 (2-(3-ethoxyphenyl)-6-pyrrolidinylquinazolinone), a novel quinazolinone derivate, and the signaling pathway of MJ-33 in human prostate cells. MJ-33 exhibited a growth inhibitory effect on DU145, LNCaP and PC-3 cells by MTT assay. DU145 cells showed greater sensitivity to the growth inhibition of MJ-33 than that of LNCaP and PC-3 cells. MJ-33 also had an inhibitory effect on the invasion, migration and adhesion of DU145 cells using Boyden chamber transwell assays, wound-healing and adhesion assay. In addition, MJ-33 inhibited cell metastasis through the reduction of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA) enzyme activities and protein levels by gelatin zymography assay and western blot analysis, respectively. MJ-33 reduced the protein levels of p-JNK, p-p38, p-ERK, p-AKT and nuclear NF-κB (p65), c-fos and c-Jun protein levels by western blotting. Using electrophoretic mobility-shift assay (EMSA), we demonstrated that MJ-33 blocked the activation of transcription factor AP-1 (activator protein-1) and NF-κB, which led to the inhibition of MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression. Collectively, our data showed that MJ-33 decreased protein levels of MAPKs (mitogen-activated protein kinases), AKT, AP-1 and NF-κB, resulting in the inhibition of matrix metalloproteinases.

Methods:   We calculated hazard ratios (HRs) for height, assessed in increments of 6.5 cm, using individual-participant data on 174374 deaths or major non-fatal vascular outcomes recorded among 1085949 people in 121 prospective studies.  Results:   For people born between 1900 and 1960, mean adult height increased 0.5-1 cm with each successive decade of birth. After adjustment for age, sex, smoking and year of birth, HRs per 6.5 cm greater height were 0.97 (95% confidence interval: 0.96-0.99) for death from any cause, 0.94 (0.93-0.96) for death from vascular causes, 1.04 (1.03-1.06) for death from cancer and 0.92 (0.90-0.94) for death from other causes. Height was negatively associated with death from coronary disease, stroke subtypes, heart failure, stomach and oral cancers, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, mental disorders, liver disease and external causes. In contrast, height was positively associated with death from ruptured aortic aneurysm, pulmonary embolism, melanoma and cancers of the pancreas, endocrine and nervous systems, ovary, breast, prostate, colorectum, blood and lung. HRs per 6.5 cm greater height ranged from 1.26 (1.12-1.42) for risk of melanoma death to 0.84 (0.80-0.89) for risk of death from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Methods:   We examined a database wherein U.S. Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network identifiers for 4,650 living kidney donors in 1987 to 2007 were linked to administrative data of a U.S. private health insurer (2000-2007 claims) to identify postdonation cancer diagnoses. Skin cancer and non-skin cancer diagnoses were ascertained from International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification diagnosis codes on billing claims. Donors were also matched one-to-one with general insurance beneficiaries by sex and age when benefits began. Diagnosis rates within observation windows were compared as rate ratios.  Results:   The median time from donation to the end of plan insurance enrollment was 7.7 years, with a median observation period of 2.1 years. Skin cancer rates were similar among prior living donors in the observation period and nondonor controls (rate ratio, 0.91; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.59-1.40). In contrast, the rate of total non-skin cancers was significantly less common among donors than among controls (rate ratio, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.55-0.99), although reduced relative risk was limited to donors captured earlier in relation to donation. Several cases of cancer diagnosis (uterine, melanoma, ""other"") were identified within the first year after donation. Prostate cancer diagnosis was significantly more common among living donors compared with controls (rate ratio, 3.80; 95% CI, 1.42-10.2).

Material and methods:   A total of 103 patients was treated curatively (RAD) and 94 postoperatively (POST-OP). The mean age was higher in the RAD group (72.6 years; range, 56.4-85.1) than in the POST-OP group (65.4 years; range, 43.9-77) (P <0.0001). According to the NCCN prognostic classification, 13 (12%) patients were at low risk, 48 (47%) at intermediate risk and 42 (41%) at high risk in the RAD group. In the POST-OP group, 13 (14%) patients were low risk, 37 (40%) at intermediate risk and 44 (46%) at high risk. Hormone therapy was used in 98 patients (95%) in the RAD group and 45 patients (47.8%) in the POST-OP group. Patients were treated with three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy. The prescription dose was 80 Gy in 2-Gy fractions in the RAD group and 70 Gy in 2-Gy fractions in the POST-OP.  Results:   No biochemical, clinical relapse was found in low-risk patients in the RAD group and 1 relapse was found in the POST-OP group. The largest number of relapses occurred (39%) and (33%) in intermediate-high risk in RAD and POST-OP groups, respectively. In the cause-specific survival analysis, no significant differences were found in the high-risk group between RAD and POST-OP groups (P = 0.9). In the analysis of 5-year biochemical relapse-free survival, no significant differences were found in the high-risk group between RAD and POST-OP groups (P = 0.1020).  Conclusions:   Radiotherapy in the RAD low-risk group was an excellent treatment. RAD and POST-OP radiotherapy were well tolerated with very low toxicity.

The method is based on a back-calculation approach using cancer-specific mortality and relative survival to derive expected incident and prevalent cases. Multiple tumors occurring in the same site for the same person (for example colon-colon) can be estimated just once. This has little effect on cancer-specific estimates, whereas it limits all cancers-combined estimates, where only cancer cases, rather than cancer diagnoses, can be accounted for by the method. The aim of this article is to present a specific strategy of application of the MIAMOD method to all cancers sites, which better approximates an estimate of 'cancer diagnoses'.  Methods:   The strategy consists of breaking down the estimation process in separate applications to the most frequent cancer sites and to a 'remainder-site', given by all malignant sites except the previous ones. The separate estimates are then summed up to derive the overall quantities for all cancers combined. Cancer-specific mortality in the years 1985-2004 in the Tuscany cancer registry area (about 1,200,000 inhabitants) and relative survival data in the same area and periods (end of follow-up, 31 December 2006) were used to produce the estimates, which were then tested using observed incidence data in the same area and period.  Results:   The standard application of the MIAMOD method underestimates all cancer incidence for both sexes. The mean relative difference between observed and expected incident cases is -14.8% for males and -17.2% for females. With the alternative method, the same mean relative difference drops to -8.2% for males and -6.1% for females.

Prostate cancer outcomes have been linked to variations in urologist density, however, the impact of geographic variation in the radiation oncologist workforce and prostate cancer mortality has yet to be investigated. The goal of this study was to determine the effect of increasing radiation oncologist density on regional prostate cancer mortality.  Methods:   Using county-level prostate cancer mortality data from the National Cancer Institute and Centers for Disease Control as well as physician workforce and health system data from the Area Resource File a regression model was built for prostate cancer mortality controlling for categorized radiation oncologist density, urologist density, county socioeconomic factors and pre-existing health system infrastructure.  Results:   There was statistically significant reduction in prostate cancer mortality (3.91-5.45% reduction in mortality) in counties with at least 1 radiation oncologist compared with counties lacking radiation oncologists. However, increasing the density of radiation oncologists beyond 1 per 100 000 residents did not yield statistically significant incremental reductions in prostate cancer mortality.  Conclusion:   The presence of at least one radiation oncologist is associated with significant reductions in prostate cancer mortality within that county. However, the incremental benefit of increasing radiation oncologist density exhibits a plateau effect providing marginal benefit. In order to optimize outcomes a geographically aware policy, which addresses the size and distribution of the workforce, must be in place in order prevent geographic disparities in prostate cancer mortality.""","""['S Aneja', 'J B Yu']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['Urologist density and county-level urologic cancer mortality.', 'Geographic analysis of urologist density and prostate cancer mortality in the United States.', 'Rural-Urban Differences in Access to Specialist Providers of Colorectal Cancer Care in the United States: A Physician Workforce Issue.', 'The negative impact of stark law exemptions on graduate medical education and health care costs: the example of radiation oncology.', 'Minority issues in prostate disease.', ""Addressing patient's unmet social needs: disparities in access to social services in the United States from 1990 to 2014, a national times series study."", 'Geographic disparities in Saskatchewan prostate cancer incidence and its association with physician density: analysis using Bayesian models.', 'Overall survival based on oncologist density in the United States: A retrospective cohort study.', 'Radiotherapy in the Caribbean: a spotlight on the human resource and equipment challenges among CARICOM nations.', 'The Caribbean Community Clinical Oncology Workforce: Analyzing Where We Are Today and Projecting for Tomorrow.']"""

We report a simple, robust, and reproducible CE-ESI-MS/MS method for the determination of sarcosine and other representative potential biomarkers in pooled urine. The pooled urine was obtained from 20 healthy adult volunteers between the ages of 23-30 years old. A solid phase extraction (SPE) technique was optimized for maximum recovery of sarcosine. With no derivatization step, excellent resolution between sarcosine and its isomers (α-alanine and β-alanine) was achieved. A separate non-SPE method was also developed for quantitative determination of highly concentrated urinary metabolites. CE separation was performed on a positively-charged, polyethyleneimine (PEI)-coated capillary using 0.4-2% formic acid in 50% methanol. Precision for intra- and inter-day standard addition calibration of sarcosine were found to be within 15%, whereas intra-day precisions for the rest of the metabolites varied from 0.03 to 13.4%.

To investigate the impact of an extended PLND on urinary and sexual function.  Patients and methods:   In all, 760 men underwent robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy from January 2010 to May 2011 by a single surgeon (AKT). Low and intermediate risk groups (as defined by the D'Amico classification) underwent a minimum of a limited PLND (obturator/external iliac packets) and high risk patients underwent an extended PLND (as limited plus hypogastric, triangle of Marcille and common iliac packets up to the level of the ureteric crossing). In order to analyse LNY for staging purposes, the high risk group (n = 82) was subdivided into patients with ≥13 LNY vs <13 LNY and the incidence of lymph node (LN) invasion was compared between these groups. To study the impact of extended PLND on functional outcomes, we evaluated patients from our total cohort who were preoperatively potent (Sexual Health Inventory for Men ≥17), continent and who received bilateral nerve-sparing surgery. Return to potency at 26 weeks postoperatively was defined as a score of ≥3 on questions 2 and 3 of the Sexual Health Inventory for Men questionnaire, and continence was defined as zero pads per day or one pad for security per day.  Results:   Median LNYs in the low, intermediate and high risk groups were (interquartile range [IQR]) 5 (2-10), 7 (3-12) and 13 (6-20) (P < 0.001); LN positivity was 0% (0 of 309), 0.8% (3 of 369) and 13.4% (11 of 82) in the three respective groups (P < 0.001). Median LNYs (IQR) among the high risk LN positive and negative patients were 20 (13-22) and 11 (5-18) (P = 0.05); 5% of the patients had positive LNs in the <13 LNY group vs 21% of patients in the >13 LNY group (P = 0.036). Median (IQR) console time was significantly different, at 120 min (95-137) for the ≥13 LNY group vs 100 min (85-120) for the <13 LNY group (P = 0.04). Among patients who fitted the inclusion criteria for functional outcomes (n = 561), 55.2% (16 of 29) with ≥20 LNs removed recovered potency at a median follow-up of 6 months postoperatively vs 70% of patients with <20 LNs (301 of 430) (P = 0.020). There was no significant difference in continence recovery between the groups.  Conclusions:   High risk patients should undergo an extended dissection with at least 13 LNs removed for accurate staging. Extended PLND with LNYs of ≥20 is associated with worse potency outcomes. With LN positivity occurring rarely in low risk patients, extended PLND may be of little oncological benefit but with significant functional compromise in this cohort.""","""['Daniel Sagalovich', 'Adam Calaway', 'Abhishek Srivastava', 'Prasanna Sooriakumaran', 'Ashutosh K Tewari']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Erratum.', 'Surgeon-led prostate cancer lymph node staging: pathological outcomes stratified by robot-assisted dissection templates and patient selection.', 'Assessment of lymph node yield after pelvic lymph node dissection in men with prostate cancer: a comparison between robot-assisted radical prostatectomy and open radical prostatectomy in the modern era.', 'Topography of lymph node metastases in prostate cancer patients undergoing radical prostatectomy and extended lymphadenectomy: results of a combined molecular and histopathologic mapping study.', 'Anatomical extent of pelvic lymphadenectomy in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy.', 'Current status of pelvic lymph node dissection in prostate cancer: the New York PLND nomogram.', 'Head-to-Head Comparison of Two Nomograms Predicting Probability of Lymph Node Invasion in Prostate Cancer and the Therapeutic Impact of Higher Nomogram Threshold.', 'Pathological outcomes and biochemical recurrence-free survival after radical prostatectomy for high-risk prostate cancer in the Indian population.', 'Comparison of Functional Outcome after Extended versus Super-Extended Pelvic Lymph Node Dissection during Radical Prostatectomy in High-Risk Localized Prostate Cancer.', 'External Validation of the Pathologic Nodal Staging Score for Prostate Cancer: A\xa0Population-based Study.', 'Current technique and results for extended pelvic lymph node dissection during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.']"""

Clinical evaluation is based on a double-blind comparative trial of good methodological quality that included 1195 patients. The median overall survival time was 4 months longer in the group treated with abiraterone + prednisone (or prednisolone) than in the group treated with placebo + prednisone (or prednisolone): 15.8 versus 11.2 months. The addition of prednisone (or prednisolone) reduced but did not eliminate the effects of hyperaldosteronism induced by abiraterone; oedema occurred in 26.7% of patients, arterial hypertension in 8.5%, and hypokalaemia in 17.1%. Moderate hepatotoxicity was reported with abiraterone and needs to be better assessed. Abiraterone was also associated with cardiac arrhythmias (7.2% versus 4.6% with placebo) and heart failure (1% versus 0.3%). Abiraterone is metabolised by cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP3A4 and inhibits isoenzyme CYP2D6, resulting in a high potential for drug interactions. Treatment is somewhat inconvenient. Abiraterone must be taken between meals, serum potassium levels must be monitored, and care must be taken to avoid interactions. Overall, the known risks of abiraterone appear to be acceptable in view of its efficacy, but patients must be carefully monitored.

Methods:   From electronic medical records of primary care practices affiliated with one health care system in San Antonio, we identified 9,267 men aged 50 to 74 with 2+ clinic visits from 2008 through 2010 and no prior prostate cancer diagnosis. Logistic regression was used to examine the association of race ethnicity with the use of PSA testing and, if tested, with an abnormal result (≥4 ng/mL) adjusted for demographics, health care, and clinical factors. Time to a follow-up activity after an abnormal PSA was assessed using Cox proportional models.  Results:   The race ethnicity of this cohort was 63% Hispanic, 27% non-Hispanic white, 7% African-American, and 3% other. In a 3-year period, 26.8% of men had at least one PSA test.

The second most common 5' fusion partner after TMPRSS2 is SLC45A3. The aim of our study was to quantify the protein expression of ERG, TMPRSS2 and SLC45A3 in prostate cancer to assess for diagnostic or prognostic utility. Six hundred and forty consecutive prostate cancer cases in tissue microarray format were immunohistochemically analyzed for ERG, TMPRSS2 and SLC45A3 protein. Resultant protein expression data was correlated to the respective gene rearrangement status and clinico-pathological parameters including PSA follow up times. ERG showed no expression in benign prostate glands. In cancer tissue, ERG protein expression showed a high rate of concordance with an underlying ERG rearrangement (91.5%). SLC45A3 showed a weaker expression in cancer as compared to benign tissue, which was pronounced in cases with SLC45A3-ERG fusion. Importantly, SLC45A3 down regulation was significantly associated with shorter PSA-free survival times. In contrast, TMPRSS2 was neither differentially expressed nor did it show a correlation between protein expression and rearrangement status. This study provides first evidence that the expression of SLC45A3 protein is down regulated through SLC45A3-ERG fusion in prostate cancer. Moreover, these cases may represent a distinct molecular subclass of ERG rearranged prostate cancer with distinct clinical features. This study also confirms that ERG protein expression is predominantly found in prostate carcinomas with ERG gene rearrangement and does not occur in benign glands.""","""['Sven Perner', 'Niels J Rupp', 'Martin Braun', 'Mark A Rubin', 'Holger Moch', 'Manfred Dietel', 'Nicolas Wernert', 'Klaus Jung', 'Carsten Stephan', 'Glen Kristiansen']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Int J Cancer""","""['Prevalence of TMPRSS2-ERG and SLC45A3-ERG gene fusions in a large prostatectomy cohort.', 'Concurrent TMPRSS2-ERG and SLC45A3-ERG rearrangements plus PTEN loss are not found in low grade prostate cancer and define an aggressive tumor subset.', 'Retention of Interstitial Genes between TMPRSS2 and ERG Is Associated with Low-Risk Prostate Cancer.', 'ERG protein expression as a biomarker of prostate cancer.', 'The progress of TMPRSS2-ETS gene fusions and their mechanism in prostate cancer.', 'SLC45A3 Serves as a Potential Therapeutic Biomarker to Attenuate White Matter Injury After Intracerebral Hemorrhage.', 'Evaluation of automatic discrimination between benign and malignant prostate tissue in the era of high precision digital pathology.', 'A transcriptomic signature for prostate cancer relapse prediction identified from the differentially expressed genes between TP53 mutant and wild-type tumors.', 'Characterization of stage-specific tumor progression in TMPRSS2-ERG (fusion)-driven and non-fusion-driven prostate cancer in GEM models.', 'Precision Targets for Intercepting the Lethal Progression of Prostate Cancer: Potential Avenues for Personalized Therapy.']"""

Methods:   Between 2004 and 2007, 17,569 men were screened in 231 small municipalities using mobile screening units. Positive FH was defined as any relative having PCa among screened men. Men were biopsied if they had digital rectal examination suggestive of PCa or PSA >4.0 ng/mL or PSA of 2.5-4 ng/mL with percent free PSA ≤ 15 %. We analyzed the association between FH and PCa using multivariable logistic regression in the first screening round of the program.  Results:   Positive FH was present in 735 men (4.2 % of total), and they were younger, better educated and more likely to have had previous PCa screening (41.5 vs. 28.5 %; P < 0.001) compared to men with negative FH. FH status did not affect compliance rates in men recommended to undergo biopsy (P = 0.94). In first round, PCa was detected in 3.1 % of screened men (n = 552). In multivariable analysis, positive FH was associated with increased PCa risk (OR = 1.79; 95 % CI, 1.21-2.65; P = 0.003).

In the present study, we found that silibinin was able to repress endogenous LRP6 expression and block Wnt3A-induced LRP6 phosphorylation and Wnt/β-catenin signaling activation in HEK293 cells. Importantly, silibinin was also able to suppress endogenous LRP6 expression and phosphorylation and block Wnt/β-catenin signaling in prostate cancer PC-3 and DU-145 cells and breast cancer MDA-MB-231 and T-47D cells. Mechanistically, silibinin inhibited LRP6 promoter activity and decreased LRP6 mRNA levels in prostate and breast cancer cells. Finally, we demonstrated that silibinin displayed anticancer activity with IC(50) values comparable to those shown to suppress LRP6 expression and Wnt/β-catenin signaling activities in prostate and breast cancer cells.

Testing diverse genetic and epigenetic features, here we show that mutation rates in cancer genomes are strikingly related to chromatin organization. Indeed, at the megabase scale, a single feature—levels of the heterochromatin-associated histone modification H3K9me3—can account for more than 40% of mutation-rate variation, and a combination of features can account for more than 55%. The strong association between mutation rates and chromatin organization is upheld in samples from different tissues and for different mutation types.

Prostate cancer cells of varying metastatic potential and apoptotic resistance show altered expression of plasma membrane ion channels and unbalanced Ca2+ homeostasis. Ca(2+)-activated Cl(-) channels (CaCCs) are robustly expressed in epithelial cells and function to regulate epithelial secretion and cell volume for maintenance of ion and tissue homeostasis in proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. ANO1/TMEM16A was recently identified as a CaCC, and it is of interest to determine whether ANO1 plays a role in development and metastasis of prostate carcinoma. Here we show that ANO1 mRNA and protein are highly expressed in human metastatic prostate cancer LNCaP and PC-3 cells by quantitative analysis of real-time PCR and Western blot. These findings were confirmed by whole-cell patch clamp recording of LNCaP and PC-3 cells with increased current density of ANO1 channels. Immunohistochemistry staining further revealed overexpression of ANO1 in human prostate cancer tissues, which correlated with the clinical TNM stage and Gleason score. Experiments with small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) targeting human ANO1 resulted in a significant reduction of proliferation, metastasis and invasion of PC-3 cells using WST-8, colony formation, wound-healing and transwell assays. Moreover, intratumoral injection of ANO1 shRNA completely inhibited established tumor growth and survival in orthotopic nude mice implanted with PC-3 cells. Our findings provide compelling evidence that upregulation of CaCC ANO1 is involved in the proliferation, progression and pathogenesis of metastatic prostate cancer. Membrane ANO1 protein may therefore serve as a biomarker, and inhibition of overexpressed ANO1 has potential for use in prostate cancer therapy.""","""['Wen Liu', 'Min Lu', 'Baogang Liu', 'Yi Huang', 'KeWei Wang']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Cancer Lett""","""['Re: Inhibition of Ca2+ -activated Cl- channel ANO1/TMEM16A expression suppresses tumor growth and invasiveness in human prostate carcinoma.', 'Inhibition of Calcium-Activated Chloride Channel ANO1/TMEM16A Suppresses Tumor Growth and Invasion in Human Lung Cancer.', 'Inhibition of TMEM16A expression suppresses growth and invasion in human colorectal cancer cells.', 'Inhibition of Ca2+ -activated chloride channel ANO1 suppresses ovarian cancer through inactivating PI3K/Akt signaling.', 'Bestrophin and TMEM16-Ca(2+) activated Cl(-) channels with different functions.', 'Role of volume-regulated and calcium-activated anion channels in cell volume homeostasis, cancer and drug resistance.', 'The impact of the Hedgehog signal pathway on the tumor immune microenvironment of gastric adenocarcinoma by integrated analysis of scRNA-seq and RNA-seq datasets.', 'ANO1-downregulation induced by schisandrathera D: a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of prostate and oral cancers.', 'TMEM16A partners with mTOR to influence pathways of cell survival, proliferation, and migration in cholangiocarcinoma.', 'Identification of a druggable pocket of the calcium-activated chloride channel TMEM16A in its open state.', 'ANO4 Expression Is a Potential Prognostic Biomarker in Non-Metastasized Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma.']"""

Recently a novel function of chloroquine (CLQ) in inhibiting degradation of autophagic vesicles has been revealed, which raises the question whether CLQ can be used as an adjuvant in targeting autophagic pro-survival mechanism in prostate cancer (PCa). We previously showed that autophagy played a protective role during hormone ablation therapy, in part, by consuming lipid droplets in PCa cells. In addition, blocking autophagy by genetic and pharmacological means in the presence of androgen deprivation caused cell death in PCa cells. To further investigate the importance of autophagy in PCa survival and dissect the role of CLQ in PCa death, we treated hormone responsive LNCaP cells with CLQ in combination with androgen deprivation. We observed that CLQ synergistically killed LNCaP cells during androgen deprivation in a dose- and time-dependent manner. We further confirmed that CLQ inhibited the maturation of autophagic vesicles and decreased the cytosolic ATP. Moreover, CLQ induced nuclear condensation and DNA fragmentation, a hallmark of apoptosis, in androgen deprived LNCaP cells.

Ten patients who underwent magnetic resonance imaging and 22-core 3D-PMB were retrospectively analyzed. For visual assessment of DWI, the prostate was divided into 22 regions corresponding to 3D-PMB. Two diagnostic radiologists determined the presence of abnormal high signal intensity in each region on DWI, and the results of DWI were compared with those of 3D-PMB. Of the 220 regions, 16 regions in six patients were positive for cancer on 3D-PMB, and 30 regions in six patients were judged as positive on DWI. On a patient-by-patient basis, sensitivity and specificity were 100% (6/6) and 100% (4/4), respectively. On a region-by-region basis, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and accuracy were 69% (11/16), 91% (185/204), 37% (11/30), 97% (185/190) and 89% (196/220), respectively. For discrepant localization between DWI and pathology, DWI-positive and pathology-positive regions tended to be adjacent to each other.

In the previous study, thirteen (1.3%) focal carcinomas and 29 (2.9%) cases with atypical proliferation were found.  Conclusions:   There was an increase of 4.2% to 6.4% of focal lesions carcinomas increased from 1.3% to 2.8%. Making additional sections in all biopsies may have practical drawbacks.

Impact of the extent of PLND may be determined by the disease risk. The aim of our study was to find the association between the extent of PLND on biochemical progression and disease risk.  Methods:   The study included 360 consecutive patients treated with RP for clinically localized prostate cancer at our department between 2000 and 2003. Patients were randomized to receive extended PLND (n = 180) and standard PLND (n = 180) at RP. Clinical and pathological data were prospectively collected. The patients did not receive any neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy. The relation of disease risk and the extent of PLND to biochemical progression-free survival (BPFS) were examined.  Results:   There were no significant differences in age, prostate-specific antigen, and other preoperative features in patients who underwent standard and extended PLND. Mean patient age was 68 y old and median follow-up was 74 mo. BPFS for the standard PLND group and the extended PLND group was 90.1% and 91.3% in low risk disease (log rank P = 0.807), 73.1% and 85.7% in intermediate risk disease (log rank P = 0.042), and 51.1% and 71.4% in high risk disease (log rank P = 0.036), respectively. In multivariate Cox proportional hazard analysis, extended PLND was an independent prognostic factor of biochemical progression-free survival when adjusting for other clinical and pathologic features.  Conclusions:   In intermediate and high risk patients, extended PLND positively affects BPFS. In low risk patients, extended PLND may be omitted to reduce operation time and complications.""","""['Jindong Ji', 'Hexing Yuan', 'Liangliang Wang', 'Jianquan Hou']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""J Surg Res""","""['Retraction: “Is the impact of the extent of lymphadenectomy in radical prostatectomy related to the disease risk?

Materials and methods:   24 prostate 3-T MRI examinations of young volunteers (YV, n=8), patients with biopsy proven prostate cancer (PC, n=8) and an aged matched control group (AC, n=8) were included. Diffusion-weighted imaging was performed using 11 b-values ranging from 0 to 800 s/mm(2).

To evaluate how well different biopsy strategies perform at detecting clinically significant prostate cancer we used computer simulation in cystoprostatectomy cases with cancer.  Materials and methods:   A computer simulation study was performed on prostates acquired at radical cystoprostatectomy. A total of 346 prostates were processed and examined for prostate cancer using 3 mm whole mount slices. The 96 prostates that contained cancer were digitally reconstructed. Biopsy simulations incorporating various degrees of random localization error were performed using the reconstructed 3-dimensional prostate computer model. Each biopsy strategy was simulated 500 times. Two definitions of clinically significant prostate cancer were used to define the reference standard, including definition 1--Gleason score 7 or greater, and/or lesion volume 0.5 ml or greater and definition 2--Gleason score 7 or greater, and/or lesion volume 0.2 ml or greater.  Results:   A total of 215 prostate cancer foci were present.

Conclusions:   To our knowledge our biopsy simulation study is the first to evaluate the performance of different sampling strategies to detect clinically important prostate cancer in a population that better reflects the demographics of a screened cohort.

GRα binds glucocorticoids, modulates transcription in a glucocorticoid dependent manner and has a growth inhibitory role in prostate cells. Due to this role glucocorticoids are often used to treat androgen independent prostate cancer. In contrast, GRβ has intrinsic transcriptional activity and binds mifepristone (RU486) but not glucocorticoids to control gene expression. To our knowledge the role of GRβ in prostate cell proliferation is unknown.  Materials and methods:   We determined GRβ levels in various prostate cancer cell lines by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and Western blot. The effect of GRβ on the kinetics of prostate cancer cell growth was determined by cell counting and flow cytometry upon mifepristone and dexamethasone treatment. Cell proliferation was also examined after siRNA mediated knockdown and over expression of GRβ.  Results:   GRβ mRNA and protein were up-regulated in LNCaP cells that over expressed the androgen receptor co-factor ARA70β. Treatment of LNCaP-ARA70β with mifepristone or siRNA targeting GRβ inhibited proliferation compared to that of parental LNCaP cells. The immortal but nontumorigenic RC165 prostate cell line and the tumorigenic DU145 prostate cell line with endogenous GRβ also showed partial growth reduction upon GRβ depletion but to a lesser extent than LNCaP-ARA70β cells. The growth stimulatory effect of ARA70β on LNCaP cells was partly GRβ dependent, as was the proliferation of RC165 cells and to a lesser extent of DU145 cells.

In prostate, DHT is the major androgen and reduction and glucuronidation are the major metabolic pathways for DHT elimination. A streamlined method for quantitation of dihydrotestosterone (DHT), 5α-androstan-3α,17β-diol (3α-diol), and 3α-diol glucuronide (diol-gluc) was established and validated for use with archived prostate tissue specimens to facilitate examination of the roles of the underlying metabolism. This involved a sequential 70/30 hexane/ethyl acetate (hex/EtOAc) extraction of steroids, followed by an ethyl acetate extraction for diol-gluc. Derivatization of the hex/EtOAc fraction with2-fluoro-1-methylpyridinium p-toluene-4-sulfonate (FMP) was used to enhance sensitivity for hydroxyl steroids and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was utilized for analysis of both fractions. The method was validated with calibration standards followed by recovery assessment from spiked samples of BPH and normal prostate. Lower limits of quantitation (LLOQ) were 50 pg/g, 20 pg/g and 100 pg/g for DHT, 3α-diol and diol-gluc, respectively for extracts from 50mg equivalents of tissue. Prepared samples were stable for up to three weeks at 4 °C and 37 °C. The method provides excellent sensitivity and selectivity for determination of tissue levels of DHT, 3α-diol, and diol-gluc. Furthermore, this protocol can easily be extended to other hydroxyl steroids, is relatively straightforward to perform and is an effective tool for assessing steroid levels in archived clinical prostate samples.""","""['Hans H Adomat', 'Onkar S Bains', 'Joanna M Lubieniecka', 'Martin E Gleave', 'Emma S Guns', 'Thomas A Grigliatti', 'Ronald E Reid', 'K Wayne Riggs']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""J Chromatogr B Analyt Technol Biomed Life Sci""","""['Androgen glucuronides analysis by liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry: could it raise new perspectives in the diagnostic field of hormone-dependent malignancies?', 'Simultaneous quantitation of nine hydroxy-androgens and their conjugates in human serum by stable isotope dilution liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry.', 'Simultaneous determination of steroid composition of human testicular fluid using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry.', 'Validation and application of a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometric method for the simultaneous determination of testosterone and dihydrotestosterone in rat prostatic tissue using a 96-well format.', 'Intraprostatic testosterone and dihydrotestosterone.

The following planning target volume (PTV) approaches were investigated: a clinical target volume (CTV) delineated on the planning CT (CTV(ct)) plus 10-mm margin (PTV(10mm)); a reduced PTV (PTV(Red)): CTV(ct) plus 5 mm in the left-right (LR) and anterior-posterior (AP) directions and 8 mm in the inferior-superior (IS) directions; and a PTV(Hull) method: the sum of CTV(ct) and CTVs from 5 CBCTs from the first week plus 3 mm in the LR and IS directions and 5 mm in the AP direction. For each approach, separate plans were calculated using a spot-scanning technique with 2 lateral fields.  Results:   Each approach achieved excellent target coverage. Differences were observed in volume receiving 98% of the prescribed dose (V(98%)) where PTV(Hull) and PTV(Red) results were superior to the PTV(10mm) concept.

There is no published data on the PSA spike with this radioisotope and the goal of this study was to quantify PSA spikes with ¹³¹Cs and compare it with published data for other isotopes.  Methods and materials:   We have been maintaining a prospective database for all patients treated with ¹³¹Cs prostate brachytherapy at our institution. We selected patients for whom followup PSA was available for at least 24 months. The PSA spike was defined as an increase of 0.2 ng/mL, followed by a decline to prespike level.  Results:   One hundred twenty-three patients had monotherapy, whereas 32 had external beam radiation therapy followed by a brachytherapy boost. Median followup was 36 months and mean numbers of PSAs obtained were 7. Forty-six (29.7%) patients had a PSA spike. The mean time and duration for the PSA spike were 12.5 and 8.8 months, respectively. The mean magnitude of increase and mean PSA value at increase were 0.63 and 1.56 ng/mL, respectively.  Conclusions:   The incidence of a PSA spike in our series is consistent with reported numbers for other radioisotopes.

Materials and methods:   A total of 124 men who were attributed a favorable risk prostate cancer status based on transrectal ultrasound guided biopsy and who were considering a policy of active surveillance underwent combined transrectal ultrasound biopsy and template prostate mapping as a confirmatory strategy.

Results:   Depending on the definition used between 8% and 22% of men had prostate cancer reclassified as clinically important by repeat transrectal ultrasound biopsy whereas template guided prostate mapping reclassified the disease in 41% to 85% of the men. Repeat transrectal ultrasound biopsy failed to detect up to 80% of clinically important cancers detected by the reference standard.

The clinical management of prostate cancer has been outlined, yet is not intended to describe quality prostate cancer care. Therefore, RAND researchers developed quality indicators for early stage prostate cancer. The ACoS (American College of Surgeons) used these indicators to perform the first national assessment to our knowledge of the quality of care among men with early stage prostate cancer undergoing expectant management.  Materials and methods:   Information from medical records was abstracted for evidence of compliance with the RAND indicators (structure and process). Weighted and stratified proportions were calculated to assess indicator compliance. Logistic regression models were fit and evaluated by hospital type and patient factors.  Results:   A weighted and stratified total of 13,876 early stage prostate cancer cases on expectant management in 2000 to 2001 were investigated. Compliance with structural indicators was high (greater than 80%) and compliance with process indicators varied (19% to 87%). Differences in process indicators were observed from models by hospital type and comorbid conditions, but not for age, race or insurance status.  Conclusions:   Using the RAND quality indicators this study revealed several process areas for quality improvement among men with early stage prostate cancer on expectant management in the United States.

Materials and methods:   We prospectively studied preoperative serum sex hormone-binding globulin, luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, and free and total testosterone in 372 patients undergoing radical prostatectomy. Biochemical recurrence was analyzed in 285 patients and defined as prostate specific antigen 0.2 ng/ml or higher at least 30 days after radical prostatectomy. Median followup was 43.6 months.  Results:   Median sex hormone-binding globulin was 37.4 nmol/l, luteinizing hormone 4.1 mU/ml, follicle-stimulating hormone 5.9 mU/ml, and free and total testosterone 0.069 and 3.7 ng/ml, respectively. There was no significant association of sex hormone-binding globulin, luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone or total testosterone with T and N stage, and margin status. Luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, and free and total testosterone were not associated with biochemical recurrence. In contrast, for each 10 U increase in sex hormone-binding globulin the risk of biochemical recurrence increased by 12% (p = 0.045). On multivariable analysis sex hormone-binding globulin achieved independent predictor status after adjusting for standard clinicopathological variables. After stepwise regression a model containing T and N stage, Gleason score, margin status, prostate weight and sex hormone-binding globulin improved the accuracy of a base model by 1.3% (79.0% vs 77.7%).

The specific uPA inhibitor plasminogen activator inhibitor type-2 (PAI-2, SerpinB2) specifically targets cell bound uPA and is internalised. Furthermore, preclinical studies have established the ""proof-of-principle"" of uPA-targeting by PAI-2-cytotoxin conjugates in human carcinoma models. However, these studies also suggest that PAI-2 is rapidly cleared via the renal system with low total dose reaching the tumour. In this study, a comparative single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and biodistribution (BD) analysis of different forms of PAI-2 labelled with the radioisotopes iodine-123 ((123)I) and technetium-99m ((99m)Tc) was undertaken.  Methods:   The pharmacokinetic (PK) properties and BD of wild-type, ΔCD-loop and PEGylated ΔCD-loop PAI-2 labelled with the commonly used diagnostic SPECT radioisotopes (99m)Tc or (123)I were compared in mouse models of human prostate carcinoma. Whole body SPECT imaging was also performed.  Results:   Both wild-type and the shorter but active ΔCD-loop form of PAI-2 (123)I-labelled indirectly via conjugation to free amine groups (termed (123)I-Bn-PAI-2) exhibited low tumour uptake, rapid excretion and similar PK profiles. Preliminary studies with a short branched-chain PEGylated (123)I-Bn-PAI-2 ΔCD-loop indicated an increase in blood retention time and tumour uptake. All (123)I-Bn-labelled radiotracers were largely excreted through the kidneys. By comparison, both wild-type (123)I-PAI-2 (labelled directly via tyrosine residues) and (99m)Tc-PAI-2 displayed different PK/BD patterns compared to (123)I-Bn-PAI-2, suggesting greater liver based catabolism and thus slower elimination. SPECT imaging mimicked the BD results of all radiotracers.  Conclusion:   The different labelling methods gave distinct PAI-2 BD and tumour uptake profiles, with radioiodination resulting in the best non-tumour organ clearance profiles. Preliminary analyses with short branched-chain PEGylated (123)I-Bn-PAI-2 ΔCD-loop suggest that further investigations with other PEGylation reagents are required to optimise this approach for tumour imaging.

Tyrosine phosphorylation of vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cad) has been implicated in the disruption of endothelial cell adherens junctions and in the diapedesis of metastatic cancer cells. We sought to determine the signaling mechanisms underlying the disruption of endothelial adherens junctions after the attachment of invasive breast cancer cells. Attachment of invasive breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231) to human umbilical vein endothelial cells induced tyrosine phosphorylation of VE-cad, dissociation of β-catenin from VE-cad, and retraction of endothelial cells. Breast cancer cell-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of VE-cad was mediated by activation of the H-Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling cascade and depended on the phosphorylation of endothelial myosin light chain (MLC). The inhibition of H-Ras or MLC in endothelial cells inhibited TEM of MDA-MB-231 cells. VE-cad tyrosine phosphorylation in endothelial cells induced by the attachment of MDA-MB-231 cells was mediated by MDA-MB-231 α(2)β(1) integrin. Compared with highly invasive MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, weakly invasive MCF-7 breast cancer cells expressed lower levels of α(2)β(1) integrin. TEM of MCF-7 as well as induction of VE-cad tyrosine phosphorylation and dissociation of β-catenin from the VE-cad complex by MCF-7 cells were lower than in MDA-MB-231 cells. These processes were restored when MCF-7 cells were treated with β(1)-activating antibody. Moreover, the response of endothelial cells to the attachment of prostatic (PC-3) and ovarian (SKOV3) invasive cancer cells resembled the response to MDA-MB-231 cells.

Loss of GSTP1 expression via promoter hypermethylation is the most common epigenetic alteration observed in human prostate cancer. Silencing of GSTP1 can increase generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and DNA damage in cells. In this study we investigated whether loss of GSTP1 contributes to increased DNA damage that may predispose men to a higher risk of prostate cancer. We found significantly elevated (103%; P < 0.0001) levels of 8-oxo-2'-deoxogunosine (8-OHdG), an oxidative DNA damage marker, in adenocarcinomas, compared to benign counterparts, which positively correlated (r = 0.2) with loss of GSTP1 activity (34%; P < 0.0001). Silencing of GSTP1 using siRNA approach in normal human prostate epithelial RWPE1 cells caused increased intracellular production of ROS and higher susceptibility of cells to H2 O2 -mediated oxidative stress. Additionally, human prostate carcinoma LNCaP cells, which contain a silenced GSTP1 gene, were genetically modified to constitutively express high levels of GSTP1. Induction of GSTP1 activity lowered endogenous ROS levels in LNCaP-pLPCX-GSTP1 cells, and when exposed to H2 O2 , these cells exhibited significantly reduced production of ROS and 8-OHdG levels, compared to vector control LNCaP-pLPCX cells. Furthermore, exposure of LNCaP cells to green tea polyphenols caused reexpression of GSTP1, which protected the cells from H2 O2 -mediated DNA damage through decreased ROS production compared to nonexposed cells. These results suggest that loss of GSTP1 expression in human prostate cells, a process that increases their susceptibility to oxidative stress-induced DNA damage, may be an important target for primary prevention of prostate cancer.""","""['Rajnee Kanwal', 'Mitali Pandey', 'Natarajan Bhaskaran', 'Gregory T Maclennan', 'Pingfu Fu', 'Lee E Ponsky', 'Sanjay Gupta']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Mol Carcinog""","""['piR-31470 epigenetically suppresses the expression of glutathione S-transferase pi 1 in prostate cancer via DNA methylation.', 'Protection against 2-hydroxyamino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo4,5-bpyridine cytotoxicity and DNA adduct formation in human prostate by glutathione S-transferase P1.', 'GSTP1 Loss results in accumulation of oxidative DNA base damage and promotes prostate cancer cell survival following exposure to protracted oxidative stress.', 'Preneoplastic prostate lesions: an opportunity for prostate cancer prevention.', 'GSTP1 and cancer: Expression, methylation, polymorphisms and signaling (Review).', 'Epigenetic factors in breast cancer therapy.', 'Radioresistance in Prostate Cancer: Focus on the Interplay between NF-κB and SOD.', 'Adaptive responses to air pollution in human dermal fibroblasts and their potential roles in aging.', 'Low expression of GSTP1 in the aqueous humour of patients with primary open-angle glaucoma.', 'Glutathione S-Transferase pi-1 Knockdown Reduces Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma Growth by Activating Oxidative Stress Response Pathways.']"""

As previous studies indicated a higher frequency of RAS and BRAF mutation rates in Eastern Asian than in Western prostate cancers and fusion genes involving the RAF family genes BRAF and RAF1 were recently identified in prostate cancer in the American population, we investigated BRAF and RAF1 alterations in Chinese prostate cancer. Using fluorescence in situ hybridization, we found that BRAF was truncated in five of 200 informative Chinese cases (2.5%) and that RAF1 was truncated in three of 204 informative cases (1.5%) and genomic rearrangements of these genes were significantly correlated with high Gleason scores (>7; P < 0.01) and have a trend to appear in high clinical stage disease. A high frequency of BRAF and RAF1 copy number gain was found (29 and 15%, respectively). BRAF copy number gain in Chinese cancers was significantly higher than in UK cases (9.2%)(P < 0.001) and correlated with a number of clinical parameters. High-level expression of BRAF was found by immunohistochemistry in Chinese cancer samples compared with adjacent nonmalignant epithelial cells, which was correlated with high BRAF copy number. We also identified KRAS codon 12 mutations in three of 96 Chinese cases, no BRAF V600E mutations were observed.

Recently we have reported that BRCA1 regulates the transcription of several genes in prostate cancer, including ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated). Although it is well accepted that ATM is a pivotal mediator in genotoxic stress, it is unknown whether ATM transcription is regulated during the molecular response to DNA damage. Here we investigate ATM transcription regulation in human prostate tumor PC3 cell line. We have found that doxorubicin and mitoxantrone repress ATM transcription in PC3 cells but etoposide and methotrexate do not affect ATM expression. We have demonstrated that BRCA1 binds to ATM promoter and after doxorubicin exposure, it is released. BRCA1 overexpression increases ATM transcription and this enhancement is abolished by BRCA1 depletion. Moreover, BRCA1-BRCT domain loss impairs the ability of BRCA1 to regulate ATM promoter activity, strongly suggesting that BRCT domain is essential for ATM regulation by BRCA1. BRCA1-overexpressing PC3 cells exposed to KU55933 ATM kinase inhibitor showed significant decreased ATM promoter activity compared to untreated cells, suggesting that ATM transcriptional regulation by BRCA1 is partially mediated by the ATM kinase activity. In addition, we have demonstrated E2F1 binding to ATM promoter before and after doxorubicin exposure. E2F1 overexpression diminishes ATM transcription after doxorubicin exposure which is impaired by E2F1 dominant negative mutants. Finally, the co-regulator of transcription CtIP increases ATM transcription. CtIP increases ATM transcription. Altogether, BRCA1/E2F1/CtIP binding to ATM promoter activates ATM transcription. Doxorubicin exposure releases BRCA1 and CtIP from ATM promoter still keeping E2F1 recruited and, in turn, represses ATM expression.""","""['Cristian Moiola', 'Paola De Luca', 'Javier Cotignola', 'Kevin Gardner', 'Elba Vazquez', 'Adriana De Siervi']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Cell Physiol Biochem""","""['Regulation of E2F1 by BRCT domain-containing protein TopBP1.', 'ATM-dependent MiR-335 targets CtIP and modulates the DNA damage response.', 'Pharmacological inhibition of ATM by KU55933 stimulates ATM transcription.', 'CtIP, a candidate tumor susceptibility gene is a team player with luminaries.', ""An emerging model for BAP1's role in regulating cell cycle progression."", 'CtIP -mediated alternative mRNA splicing finetunes the DNA damage response.', 'CtIP is required for DNA damage-dependent induction of P21.', 'BRCA1 and p53 regulate critical prostate cancer pathways.']"""

Methods and materials:   Between 1998 and 2009, 229 patients were treated with HDR brachytherapy followed 3 weeks later by supplemental EBRT. The HDR brachytherapy boost consisted of three fractions of (192)Ir (5.5-7.5Gy per fraction), and EBRT consisted of intensity-modulated radiotherapy delivering an additional 45.0-50.4Gy directed to the prostate gland and seminal vesicles.

Translation of this technology to full clinical use, however, requires the capability to generate thermal coagulation in a volume up to that of the prostate gland itself. The aim of this study was to investigate the parameters required to treat a full 3D human prostate accurately with a multi-element transurethral applicator and multiplanar MR temperature control.  Methods:   The approach was a combination of simulations (to select appropriate parameters) followed by experimental confirmation in tissue-mimicking phantoms. A ten-channel, MRI-compatible transurethral ultrasound therapy system was evaluated using six human prostate models (average volume: 36 cm(3)) obtained from the preliminary human feasibility study. Real-time multiplanar MR thermometry at 3 T was used to control the spatial heating pattern in up to nine planes simultaneously. Treatment strategies incorporated both single (4.6 or 8.1 MHz) and dual (4.6 and 14.4 MHz) frequencies, as well as maximum acoustic surface powers of 10 or 20 W cm(-2).  Results:   Treatments at 4.6 MHz were capable of coagulating a volume equivalent to 97% of the prostate. Increasing power from 10 to 20 W cm(-2) reduced treatment times by approximately 50% with full treatments taking 26 ± 3 min at a coagulation rate of 1.8 ± 0.4 cm(3) min(-1). A dual-frequency 4.6∕14.4 MHz treatment strategy was shown to be the most effective configuration for achieving full human prostate treatment while maintaining good treatment accuracy for small treatment radii. The dual-frequency approach reduced overtreatment close to the prostate base and apex, confirming the simulations.  Conclusions:   This study reinforces the capability of MRI-controlled transurethral ultrasound therapy to treat full prostate volumes in a short treatment time with good spatial targeting accuracy and provides key parameters necessary for the next clinical trial.""","""[""William Apoutou N'djin"", 'Mathieu Burtnyk', 'Ilya Kobelevskiy', 'Stefan Hadjis', 'Michael Bronskill', 'Rajiv Chopra']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['3D conformal MRI-controlled transurethral ultrasound prostate therapy: validation of numerical simulations and demonstration in tissue-mimicking gel phantoms.', 'Investigation of power and frequency for 3D conformal MRI-controlled transurethral ultrasound therapy with a dual frequency multi-element transducer.', 'Method for MRI-guided conformal thermal therapy of prostate with planar transurethral ultrasound heating applicators.', 'Catheter-based ultrasound applicators for selective thermal ablation: progress towards MRI-guided applications in prostate.', 'Targeted prostate biopsy and MR-guided therapy for prostate cancer.', 'MRI-guided transurethral insonation of silica-shell phase-shift emulsions in the prostate with an advanced navigation platform.', 'Evaluation of Focal Ablation of Magnetic Resonance Imaging Defined Prostate Cancer Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging Controlled Transurethral Ultrasound Therapy with Prostatectomy as the Reference Standard.', 'MRI-guided biopsies and minimally invasive therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Modelling of endoluminal and interstitial ultrasound hyperthermia and thermal ablation: applications for device design, feedback control and treatment planning.']"""

NPIP generates needle configurations that are specific to the anatomy of the patient, avoid critical structures near the penile bulb and other healthy structures, and avoid needle collisions inside the body.  Methods:   NPIP consisted of three major components: a method for generating a set of candidate needles, a needle selection component that chose a candidate needle subset to be inserted, and a dose planner for verifying that the final needle configuration could meet dose objectives. NPIP was used to compute needle configurations for prostate cancer data sets from patients previously treated at our clinic. NPIP took two user-parameters: a number of candidate needles, and needle coverage radius, δ. The candidate needle set consisted of 5000 needles, and a range of δ values was used to compute different needle configurations for each patient. Dose plans were computed for each needle configuration. The number of needles generated and dosimetry were analyzed and compared to the physician implant.  Results:   NPIP computed at least one needle configuration for every patient that met dose objectives, avoided healthy structures and needle collisions, and used as many or fewer needles than standard practice. These needle configurations corresponded to a narrow range of δ values, which could be used as default values if this system is used in practice. The average end-to-end runtime for this implementation of NPIP was 286 s, but there was a wide variation from case to case.  Conclusions:   The authors have shown that NPIP can automatically generate skew line needle configurations with the aforementioned properties, and that given the correct input parameters, NPIP can generate needle configurations which meet dose objectives and use as many or fewer needles than the current HDR brachytherapy workflow. Combined with robot assisted brachytherapy, this system has the potential to reduce side effects associated with treatment. A physical trial should be done to test the implant feasibility of NPIP needle configurations.""","""['Timmy Siauw', 'Adam Cunha', 'Dmitry Berenson', 'Alper Atamturk', 'I-Chow Hsu', 'Ken Goldberg', 'Jean Pouliot']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['IPIP: A new approach to inverse planning for HDR brachytherapy by directly optimizing dosimetric indices.', 'Simultaneous needle catheter selection and dwell time optimization for preplanning of high-dose-rate brachytherapy of prostate cancer.', 'Adaptation of the CVT algorithm for catheter optimization in high dose rate brachytherapy.', 'Use of flexible needles and ways to control their placement in robot-assisted prostate brachytherapy.', 'Robotic brachytherapy of the prostate.', 'Overcoming pubic arch interference in prostate brachytherapy using steerable needles.', 'Multiple direction needle-path planning and inverse dose optimization for robotic low-dose rate brachytherapy.', 'Bi-objective optimization of catheter positions for high-dose-rate prostate brachytherapy.', 'Hybrid optimization based on non-coplanar needles for brachytherapy dose planning.', 'A fast multitarget inverse treatment planning strategy optimizing dosimetric measures for high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy.']"""

The aim of the current work was to assess the progress of prostate implant quality via postimplant dosimetry over seven years.  Methods:   The following factors were investigated to assess the PID results obtained over seven years: the improvement in implant technique, the computed tomography (CT) delineation-based PID versus ultrasound-CT (US-CT) fusion-based PID, and the evolution of parameters such as D90 and NDR (natural dose ratio). The correlation between dosimetric parameters and clinical outcomes were also evaluated.  Results:   The seven years PID learning curve shows clear changes in dosimetric trend for the 265 patients studied. Manual target contouring on CT was shown to overestimate the prostate volume when compared to ultrasound data, translating to CT-based D90 values being lower than US-CT D90. It was found that NDR does not contribute with additional dosimetric information to postimplant dosimetry evaluation. Patient follow-up data show that 4.7% patients have relapsed, and urinary retention was reported in 2.7% of the patients.  Conclusions:   CT-based PID was found less reliable than US-CT fusion-based PID due to target volume overestimation. This result shows the biased interpretation of low D90 values based on CT-based targeting, providing unreliable correlations between D90 and relapse probability. The low urinary retention statistics are in accordance with the PID data for the organ, as only 5.2% of patients had their PID D10 > 218 Gy, i.e., above the recommended GEC-ESTRO guidelines.

Our goal was to develop a decision support system (DSS) for detecting and localizing peripheral zone prostate cancers by using machine learning approach to calculate a cancer probability map from multiparametric MR images (MP-MRI).  Methods:   This IRB approved Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act compliant retrospective study consisted of 31 patients (mean age and serum prostate specific antigen of 60.4 and 6.62 ng∕ml, respectively) who had MP-MRI at 3 T followed by radical prostatectomy. Seven patients were excluded due to technical issues with their MP-MRI (e.g., motion artifact, failure to perform all sequences). Cancer and normal regions were identified in the peripheral zone by correlating them to whole mount histology slides of the excised prostatectomy specimens. To facilitate the correlation, tissue blocks matching the MR slices were obtained using a MR-based patient-specific mold. Segmented regions on the MP-MRI were correlated to histopathology and used as training sets for the learning system that generated the cancer probability maps. Leave-one-patient-out cross-validation on the cancer and normal regions was performed to determine the learning system's efficacy, an evolutionary strategies approach (also known as a genetic algorithm) was used to find the optimal values for a set of parameters, and finally a cancer probability map was generated.  Results:   For the 24 patients that were used in the study, 225 cancer and 264 noncancerous regions were identified from the region maps. The efficacy of DSS was first determined without optimizing support vector machines (SVM) parameters, where a region having a cancer probability greater than or equal to 50% was considered as a correct classification. The nonoptimized system had an f-measure of 85% and the Kappa coefficient of 71% (Rater's agreement, where raters are DSS and ground truth histology). The efficacy of the DSS after optimizing SVM parameters using a genetic algorithm had an f-measure of 89% and a Kappa coefficient of 80%. Thus, after optimization of the DSS there was a 4% increase in the f-measure and a 9% increase in the Kappa coefficient.  Conclusions:   This DSS provides a cancer probability map for peripheral zone prostate tumors based on endorectal MP-MRI. These cancer probability maps can potentially aid radiologists in accurately localizing peripheral zone prostate cancers for planning targeted biopsies, focal therapy, and follow up for active surveillance.""","""['Vijay Shah', 'Baris Turkbey', 'Haresh Mani', 'Yuxi Pang', 'Thomas Pohida', 'Maria J Merino', 'Peter A Pinto', 'Peter L Choyke', 'Marcelino Bernardo']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Combined unsupervised-supervised classification of multiparametric PET/MRI data: application to prostate cancer.', 'Transition zone prostate cancer: detection and localization with 3-T multiparametric MR imaging.', 'Central gland and peripheral zone prostate tumors have significantly different quantitative imaging signatures on 3 Tesla endorectal, in vivo T2-weighted MR imagery.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging in the detection of prostate cancer.', 'Multi-resolution super learner for voxel-wise classification of prostate cancer using multi-parametric MRI.', 'Machine and Deep Learning Prediction Of Prostate Cancer Aggressiveness Using Multiparametric MRI.', 'The feasibility of a dose painting procedure to treat prostate cancer based on mpMR images and hierarchical clustering.', 'Synthesis of Prostate MR Images for Classification Using Capsule Network-Based GAN Model.', 'Imaging-Based Algorithm for the Local Grading of Glioma.']"""

To assess the role of β1 integrin in vivo, we conditionally deleted β1 integrin from prostate epithelium and subsequently crossed these mice to the TRAMP prostate carcinogenesis model. Deletion of β1 integrin following castration and subsequent androgen supplementation resulted in an expansion of the p63-positive basal cell population and decreased differentiation. Consistent with these findings, deletion of β1 integrin in TRAMP mice decreased animal survival, decreased retention of normal prostate morphology, increased the percentage of tissue with poorly differentiated carcinoma, and increased cell proliferation.

However, its effect is limited as some cancers including pancreatic cancer show de novo resistance to TRAIL induced apoptosis. In this study we report that GSK-3 inhibition using the pharmacologic agent AR-18, enhanced TRAIL sensitivity in a range of pancreatic and prostate cancer cell lines. This sensitization was found to be caspase-dependent, and both pharmacological and genetic knock-down of GSK-3 isoforms resulted in apoptotic features as shown by cleavage of PARP and caspase-3. Elevated levels of reactive oxygen intermediates and disturbance of mitochondrial membrane potential point to a mitochondrial amplification loop for TRAIL-induced apoptosis after GSK-3 inhibition. Consistent with this, overexpression of anti-apoptotic mitochondrial targets such as Bcl-XL, Mcl-1, and Bcl-2 rescued PANC-1 and PPC-1 cells from TRAIL sensitization. However, overexpression of the caspase-8 inhibitor CrmA also inhibited the sensitizing effects of GSK-3 inhibitor, suggesting an additional role for GSK-3 that inhibits death receptor signaling. Acute treatment of mice bearing PANC-1 xenografts with a combination of AR-18 and TRAIL also resulted in a significant increase in apoptosis, as measured by caspase-3 cleavage. Sensitization to TRAIL occurred despite an increase in β-catenin due to GSK-3 inhibition, suggesting that the approach might be effective even in cancers with dysregulated β-catenin. These results suggest that GSK-3 inhibitors might be effectively combined with TRAIL for the treatment of pancreatic cancer.""","""['Shadi Mamaghani', 'Craig D Simpson', 'Pinjiang M Cao', 'May Cheung', 'Sue Chow', 'Bizhan Bandarchi', 'Aaron D Schimmer', 'David W Hedley']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Differential activity of GSK-3 isoforms regulates NF-κB and TRAIL- or TNFα induced apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells.', 'Bcl-xL inhibition by molecular-targeting drugs sensitizes human pancreatic cancer cells to TRAIL.', 'Glycogen synthase kinase-3beta suppression eliminates tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand resistance in prostate cancer.', 'Down-regulation of intracellular anti-apoptotic proteins, particularly c-FLIP by therapeutic agents; the novel view to overcome resistance to TRAIL.', 'GSK-3 Inhibitors in the Regulation and Control of Colon Carcinoma.', 'GSK-3β Allosteric Inhibition: A Dead End or a New Pharmacological Frontier?', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3β: A True Foe in Pancreatic Cancer.', 'PET imaging of glycogen synthase kinase-3 in pancreatic cancer xenograft mouse models.', 'Lithium and Therapeutic Targeting of GSK-3.', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3β in Cancer Biology and Treatment.']"""

We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis of 21,791 individuals from 10 epidemiologic studies and validated these findings in 7,046 individuals in an additional six studies. We identified twelve genomic regions (SNPs) associated with circulating SHBG concentrations. Loci near the identified SNPs included SHBG (rs12150660, 17p13.1, p = 1.8 × 10(-106)), PRMT6 (rs17496332, 1p13.3, p = 1.4 × 10(-11)), GCKR (rs780093, 2p23.3, p = 2.2 × 10(-16)), ZBTB10 (rs440837, 8q21.13, p = 3.4 × 10(-09)), JMJD1C (rs7910927, 10q21.3, p = 6.1 × 10(-35)), SLCO1B1 (rs4149056, 12p12.1, p = 1.9 × 10(-08)), NR2F2 (rs8023580, 15q26.2, p = 8.3 × 10(-12)), ZNF652 (rs2411984, 17q21.32, p = 3.5 × 10(-14)), TDGF3 (rs1573036, Xq22.3, p = 4.1 × 10(-14)), LHCGR (rs10454142, 2p16.3, p = 1.3 × 10(-07)), BAIAP2L1 (rs3779195, 7q21.3, p = 2.7 × 10(-08)), and UGT2B15 (rs293428, 4q13.2, p = 5.5 × 10(-06)).

We found evidence of sex-differentiated genetic influences on SHBG. In a sex-specific GWAS, the loci 4q13.2-UGT2B15 was significant in men only (men p = 2.5 × 10(-08), women p = 0.66, heterogeneity p = 0.003). Additionally, three loci showed strong sex-differentiated effects: 17p13.1-SHBG and Xq22.3-TDGF3 were stronger in men, whereas 8q21.12-ZBTB10 was stronger in women. Conditional analyses identified additional signals at the SHBG gene that together almost double the proportion of variance explained at the locus. Using an independent study of 1,129 individuals, all SNPs identified in the overall or sex-differentiated or conditional analyses explained ~15.6% and ~8.4% of the genetic variation of SHBG concentrations in men and women, respectively.

Alterations in AR function are central to reproductive disorders, prostate cancer, and Kennedy disease. AR activity is influenced by post-translational modifications, but their role in AR-based diseases is poorly understood. Conjugation by small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) proteins at two synergy control (SC) motifs in AR exerts a promoter context-dependent inhibitory role. SC motifs are composed of a four-amino acid core that is often preceded and/or followed by nearby proline or glycine residues. The function of these flanking residues, however, has not been examined directly. Remarkably, several AR mutations associated with oligospermia and androgen insensitivity syndrome map to Pro-390, the conserved proline downstream of the first SC motif in AR. Similarly, mutations at Gly-524, downstream of the second SC motif, were recovered in recurrent prostate cancer samples. We now provide evidence that these clinically isolated substitutions lead to a partial loss of SC motif function and AR SUMOylation that affects multiple endogenous genes. Consistent with a structural role as terminators of secondary structure elements, substitution of Pro-390 by Gly fully supports both SC motif function and SUMOylation.

We assessed the safety and tolerability of siltuximab in combination with docetaxel, the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel alone and with siltuximab, and the efficacy and pharmacodynamics of siltuximab plus docetaxel.  Patients and methods:   In an open-label, dose-escalation, multicenter, phase 1 study, patients with metastatic, progressive CRPC received docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) q3w plus siltuximab 6 mg/kg q2w (n=12), 9 mg/kg q3w (n=12), or 12 mg/kg q3w (n=15). Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), PSA, and radiologic response according to WHO criteria were evaluated.  Results:   DLT was reported in 1 of 11 patients receiving 6 mg/kg, 1 of 12 receiving 9 mg/kg, and in 1 of 14 receiving 12 mg/kg. Common Grade ≥ 3 adverse events were neutropenia (73 %), leukopenia (60 %), lymphopenia (30 %), dyspnea (19 %), and fatigue (14 %). Toxicities were not dose dependent. Siltuximab did not affect docetaxel pharmacokinetics. The pharmacokinetic profile for siltuximab in combination was similar to single-agent siltuximab pharmacokinetics. Twenty-three (62 %; 95 % CI 45 %, 78 %) of 37 combination-treated patients achieved a confirmed ≥ 50 % PSA decline. Of 17 patients with measurable disease at baseline, 2 confirmed and 2 unconfirmed radiologic partial responses ranging 190 to 193 days were achieved with 9- and 12-mg/kg siltuximab.

Methods:   A male in his 60s with prostatic carcinoma consented to this study. Full details of treatment costs in AUD were obtained (AUD 1.0, approx. EUR 0.6). A detailed patient diary accurately cross-referenced the consultations, investigations, admissions and treatment. Costs were recorded on a spreadsheet, dated and grouped under eight major headings related to treatment. Costs were compared for radiation cystitis treatment pre- and post-HBOT, to calculate savings or losses.  Results:   The study covered three years (including 2.5 years post successful HBOT). Costs prior to HBOT (139 days) were AUD32,571.42 at an average of AUD231.09 per day, 70% from inpatient fees. Direct HBOT costs were AUD12,014.95 for 38 treatments, AUD316.18 per treatment. Post-HBOT (897 days), healthcare costs were AUD17,113.42 (AUD19.08 per day), with no emergency admissions. HBOT reduced costs of inpatient admissions, consultations, investigations and procedures and provided a projected healthcare saving of AUD187,483.96 over a 2.5 year follow up.  Conclusions:   The cost of HBOT compared favourably against other costs, and HBOT may provide major health cost savings in this condition.

Methods:   RTE of the prostate was performed in 60 PC patients prior to radical prostatectomy (RP). All patients were examined by a novice and an expert observer in a blinded fashion. The novice's results were validated with the results of the expert. Kappa indexes, sensitivities, specificities as well as the duration of the examination were assessed. Learning curves (LC) were obtained by assessment of 16 (LC A) and eight (LC B) prostate sectors. Cochrane-Armitage trend test, Chi(2) test and t test for paired samples were used.  Results:   For the 16-sector method (LC A), overall sensitivity and specificity were 58.2 and 77.7 % and, for the 8-sector method, 68.3 and 64.5 %, respectively. For LC A, sensitivity rose over the whole study period (p = 0.0055). As a result, no learning plateau was reached. In contrast, a learning plateau with no constant rise in sensitivity (p = 0.4667) was reached for LC B after 30 examined patients. The mean examination time for both observers was 7.9 min (±3.7).  Conclusions:   When being trained by an expert examiner, skills in RTE of the prostate can be obtained quickly. Performed by a trained examiner, the examination itself is little time-consuming.

We sought to examine whether testosterone and related hormones are associated with incident prostate, lung, and colorectal cancer.  Methods:   This was a population-based cohort study. Demographic and clinical predictors of cancer, and testosterone, sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), and luteinizing hormone (LH) were measured between 2001 and 2004 in 3,635 community-dwelling men aged 70 to 88 years (mean 77 years). Cancer notifications were obtained via electronic record linkage until December 31, 2010.  Results:   During a mean follow-up period of 6.7 ± 1.8 years, there were 297, 104, and 82 cases of prostate, colorectal, and lung cancer. In adjusted competing risks proportional hazards models, each one SD increase in free testosterone was associated with a 9% increase in prostate cancer risk (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.00-1.18), but other hormones were not significantly associated. No significant associations were observed between hormonal parameters and colorectal cancer. Higher total testosterone was associated with lung cancer. Compared with the mean of 15 nmol/L, men with levels of 20 nmol/L were 1.38 times more likely to be cases (95% CI, 1.21-1.57), whereas those with levels of 30 nmol/L were 3.62 times more likely to be cases (95% CI, 2.53-5.18). Higher free testosterone was also associated with lung cancer, though SHBG and LH were not. Associations were maintained after exclusion of current smokers.

Despite high incidence rates and the common adverse effects there is a lack of supportive measures for male patients and specific physical exercise recommendations for prostate cancer patients during rehabilitation or in the aftercare are still missing.  Methods/design:   The ProRehab Project aims to establish rehabilitative sports groups particularly for prostate cancer patients and to evaluate the effects of the offered exercise program. Starting 8-12 weeks after prostatectomy or combination therapy, prostate cancer patients will exercise for 15 months within a patient preference randomized controlled trial. One exercise session will be conducted within a pre-established rehabilitative sports group, while the other will be completed independently. Patients in the control group will not participate in the intervention. The main outcomes of the study include aerobic fitness, quality of life, incontinence and erectile dysfunction.  Discussion:   By combining science, practice, and public relations the first rehabilitative sports groups for prostate cancer patients in Germany have been set up and thus contribute to the care structure for prostate cancer patients.

However, these AKT sites are not conserved in mouse, and it has not been clear whether AKT negatively regulates murine p27. Transgenic mice with a probasin promoter controlled prostate specific reverse tetracycline transactivator (ARR2Pb-rtTA) were generated and used to achieve doxycycline inducible expression of a tetracycline operon regulated constitutively active myristoylated AKT1 transgene (tetO-myrAKT). Doxycycline induction of myrAKT occurred within 1 day and rapidly induced proliferation (within 4 days) and the development of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) lesions in ventral prostate, which did not progress to prostate cancer. Cells in these lesions expressed high levels of p27, had increased proliferation, and there was apoptosis of centrally located cells. Doxycycline withdrawal resulted in apoptosis of cells throughout the lesions and rapid clearing of hyperplastic glands, confirming in vivo the critical antiapoptotic functions of AKT. Significantly, analyses of prostates immediately after initiating doxycycline treatment further showed that p27 expression was rapidly increased, coincident with the induction of myrAKT and prior to the development of hyperplasia and PIN. These findings establish in vivo that murine p27 is not negatively regulated by AKT and indicate that proliferation in PI3 kinase/AKT pathway driven mouse models is mediated by p27 independent mechanisms that may be distinct from those in human. Further studies using prostate specific doxycycline regulated transgene expression may be useful to assess the acute effects of inducing additional transgenes in adult murine prostate epithelium, and to assess the requirements for continued transgene expression in transgene induced tumors.""","""['Hongyun Wang', 'Youyuan Xu', 'Zi Fang', 'Sen Chen', 'Steven P Balk', 'Xin Yuan']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['A prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia-dependent p27 Kip1 checkpoint induces senescence and inhibits cell proliferation and cancer progression.', 'BCR/ABL regulates expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27Kip1 through the phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase/AKT pathway.', 'Sulforaphane down-regulates SKP2 to stabilize p27(KIP1) for inducing antiproliferation in human colon adenocarcinoma cells.', 'The inhibition of activated hepatic stellate cells proliferation by arctigenin through G0/G1 phase cell cycle arrest: persistent p27(Kip1) induction by interfering with PI3K/Akt/FOXO3a signaling pathway.', 'Androgen Receptor Enhances p27 Degradation in Prostate Cancer Cells through Rapid and Selective TORC2 Activation.', 'ErbB2 Signaling Increases Androgen Receptor Expression in Abiraterone-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Androgen receptor functions in prostate cancer development and progression.', 'Activation of Akt1 accelerates carcinogen-induced tumorigenesis in mammary gland of virgin and post-lactating transgenic mice.', 'Prostate cancer induced by loss of Apc is restrained by TGFβ signaling.', 'Silencing of protein kinase D2 induces glioma cell senescence via p53-dependent and -independent pathways.']"""

Among 167 oncology outpatients with breast, prostate, lung, or brain cancer and 85 of their FCs, growth mixture modeling (GMM) was used to identify latent classes of individuals based on General Sleep Disturbance Scale (GSDS) obtained prior to, during, and for four months following completion of radiation therapy. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and haplotypes in candidate cytokine genes were interrogated for differences between the two latent classes. Multiple logistic regression was used to assess the effect of phenotypic and genotypic characteristics on GSDS group membership. Two latent classes were identified: lower sleep disturbance (88.5%) and higher sleep disturbance (11.5%).

TRUS-guided biopsy, under local anaesthetic and prophylactic antibiotics, is now the most widely accepted method to diagnose prostate cancer. However, the sensitivity and specificity of greyscale TRUS in the detection of prostate cancer is low. Prostate cancer most commonly appears as a hypoechoic focal lesion in the peripheral zone on TRUS but the appearances are variable with considerable overlap with benign lesions. Because of the low accuracy of greyscale TRUS, TRUS-guided biopsies have become established in the acquisition of systematic biopsies from standard locations. The number of systematic biopsies has increased over the years, with 10-12 cores currently accepted as the minimum standard. This article describes the technique of TRUS and biopsy and its complications.

The aim of our phase I-II clinical trial was to assess the efficacy and toxicity of docetaxel-ifosfamide combination chemotherapy in patients with castration-resistant metastatic prostate cancer (CRPC).  Patients and methods:   A total of 31 patients were enrolled to receive first-line chemotherapy consisting of 40-60 mg/m(2) docetaxel followed by 3.0 g/m(2) ifosfamide with mesna. All drugs were administered intravenously. The maximum duration of the chemotherapy was six cycles. The median age of the patients was 70 (range 58-82) years. Prostate specific antigen (PSA) responses were determined according to the PSA working group guidelines and all toxicities, time-to-progression and overall survival were determined according to the WHO criteria.  Results:   The objective PSA response rate was 32% in 11/31 patients. The mean PSA value at baseline was 300 (range 2.5-1577) μg/l. The overall median survival was 14.1 months; 15 patients were alive at a median follow-up time of 18 months. The observed side-effects were as expected, with grade 3-4 neutropenia developing in 38% of the cycles, whereas febrile neutropenia occurred in only 12% of the patients. The median number of administered cycles was 4.8. No acute hypersensitivity reactions were observed. Transient renal insufficiency developed in two patients, thus necessitating dose reductions.  Conclusion:   The combination of docetaxel and ifosfamide seems to be well-tolerated and has some activity in patients with CRPC.

Prostate cancer is indisputably one of the main targets of IMRT. However, the current status and interfacility differences in dose-prescription policies for prostate IMRT are unknown. Therefore, a nationwide survey of 43 institutions that had implemented prostate IMRT was conducted by sending a questionnaire regarding the above-mentioned issues. Thirty-three institutions (77%) had responded to the questionnaire by the end of October 2010. A total of 5245 patients with localized prostate cancer had been treated with IMRT by the end of 2009. Regular multileaf collimator-based techniques were the most common beam delivery method. Dose-prescription policies were divided into four major categories: isocenter-based (@isocenter), dose delivered to 95% of the planning target volume (PTV) (D95)-based (D95@PTV), mean dose to the PTV-based (Mean@PTV), and mean dose to the clinical target volume (CTV)-based (@CTV). The mean doses of the CTV and PTV, and the volume of the PTV receiving 95% of the dose (V95) were significantly higher with the D95@PTV policy than with the other prescription policies. Low-dose areas and hot spots were observed within the PTV in plans with @isocenter and @CTV policies. In conclusion, there are currently considerable differences among institutions in Japan regarding target doses for prostate IMRT. The D95@PTV prescription policy resulted in significant dose escalation compared with the other policies. These differences should be taken into consideration when interpreting treatment outcomes and creating multi-institutional protocols in the future.""","""['Takashi Mizowaki', 'Kazuo Hatano', 'Masahiro Hiraoka']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""J Radiat Res""","""['Towards automated on-line adaptation of 2-Step IMRT plans: QUASIMODO phantom and prostate cancer cases.', 'Persistently better treatment planning results of intensity-modulated (IMRT) over conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) in prostate cancer patients with significant variation of clinical target volume and/or organs-at-risk.', 'Prostate and seminal vesicle volume based consideration of prostate cancer patients for treatment with 3D-conformal or intensity-modulated radiation therapy.', ""Practical aspects of inverse-planned intensity-modulated radiation therapy for prostate cancer: a radiation treatment planner's perspective."", 'Medical Imaging Biomarker Discovery and Integration Towards AI-Based Personalized Radiotherapy.', 'Target coverage of daily cone-beam computed tomography in breath-hold image-guided radiotherapy for gastric lymphoma.', 'Analysis of prostate intensity- and volumetric-modulated arc radiation therapy planning quality with PlanIQTM.', 'Dose impact of rectal gas on prostatic IMRT and VMAT.', 'Dose-volume histogram comparison between static 5-field IMRT with 18-MV X-rays and helical tomotherapy with 6-MV X-rays.', 'Results and DVH analysis of late rectal bleeding in patients treated with 3D-CRT or IMRT for localized prostate cancer.']"""

We have demonstrated that Nodal, another member of the TGF-β superfamily, and its receptors are expressed in prostate cancer cells. Nodal and TGF-β exerted similar biological effects on prostate cells; both inhibited proliferation in WPE, RWPE1 and DU145 cells, whereas neither had any effect on the proliferation of LNCaP or PC3 cells. Interestingly, Nodal and TGF-β induced migration in PC3 cells, but not in DU145 cells. TGF-β induced predominantly phosphorylation of Smad3, whereas Nodal induced phosphorylation of only Smad2. We also determined the expression and differential role of Ski, a corepressor of Smad2/3, in Nodal and TGF-β signaling in prostate cancer cells. Similar levels of Ski mRNA were found in several established prostate cell lines; however, high levels of Ski protein were only detected in prostate cancer cells and prostate cancer tissue samples. Exogenous Nodal and TGF-β had no effects on Ski mRNA levels. On the other hand, TGF-β induced a rapid degradation of Ski protein mediated by the proteasomal pathway, whereas Nodal had no effect on Ski protein. Reduced Ski levels correlated with increased basal and TGF-β-induced Smad2/3 phosphorylation. Knockdown of endogenous Ski reduced proliferation in DU145 cells and enhanced migration of PC3 cells.

Between 2000 and 2006, 41 patients received salvage RT because of increasing prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels following an RP for clinically localized prostate cancer. All the patients received conformal radiotherapy to the prostate bed. The prescribed radiation dose was 60-70 Gy in 26-35 fractions. The overall 5-year biochemical disease-free survival rate was 38%. A multivariate analysis showed that the following pathological findings of the surgical specimen were significantly associated with biochemical failure following salvage RT: a high Gleason score, a negative surgical margin, seminal vesicle invasion, lymphatic vessel invasion and negative vascular invasion.

A questionnaire-based national structure survey was conducted from March 2010 to January 2011 by the Japanese Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology (JASTRO). These data were analyzed in terms of the institutional stratification of the Patterns of Care Study (PCS). The total numbers of new cancer patients and total of cancer patients (new and repeat) treated with radiation in 2009 were estimated at 201,000 and 240,000, respectively. The type and numbers of systems in actual use consisted of Linac (816), telecobalt (9), Gamma Knife (46), (60)Co remote afterloading system (RALS) (29) and (192)Ir RALS systems (130). The Linac systems used dual energy function for 586 (71.8%), 3DCRT for 663 (81.3%) and IMRT for 337 units (41.3%). There were 529 JASTRO-certified radiation oncologists (ROs), 939.4 full-time equivalent (FTE) ROs, 113.1 FTE medical physicists and 1836 FTE radiation therapists. The frequency of interstitial radiation therapy use for prostate and of intensity-modulated radiotherapy increased significantly. PCS stratification can clearly identify the maturity of structures based on their academic nature and caseload. Geographically, the more JASTRO-certified physicians there were in a given area, the more radiation therapy tended to be used for cancer patients. In conclusion, the Japanese structure has clearly improved during the past 19 years in terms of equipment and its use, although a shortage of manpower and variations in maturity disclosed by PCS stratification remained problematic in 2009.""","""['Teruki Teshima', 'Hodaka Numasaki', 'Masamichi Nishio', 'Hiroshi Ikeda', 'Kenji Sekiguchi', 'Norihiko Kamikonya', 'Masahiko Koizumi', 'Masao Tago', 'Yutaka Ando', 'Nobuhito Tsukamoto', 'Atsuro Terahara', 'Katsumasa Nakamura', 'Masao Murakami', 'Mitsuhiro Takahashi', 'Tetsuo Nishimura;Japanese Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology Database Committee']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""J Radiat Res""","""['Japanese structure survey of radiation oncology in 2005 based on institutional stratification of patterns of care study.', 'Japanese Structure Survey of Radiation Oncology in 2011.', 'Japanese structure survey of radiation oncology in 2010.', 'Status of Japanese radiation oncology.', 'Patterns of care study in Japan.', 'Japanese structure survey of radiation oncology in 2015.', 'Repetitive Painting (REPEAT) Irradiation in Stereotactic Radiotherapy Using Helical Tomotherapy.', 'Particle therapy using protons or carbon ions for cancer patients with cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIED): a retrospective multi-institutional study.', 'Japanese structure survey of radiation oncology in 2013.', 'Japanese structure survey of radiation oncology in 2012.']"""

The TRUS volume study was performed in 21 patients, followed by large-bore computed tomography of patients in the lithotomy position. Then, we created TRUS-CT fusion images using a radiation planning treatment system. TRUS images in which the prostate outline was the largest were overlaid on CT images with the narrowest pubic arch. PAI was estimated in the right and left arch separately and classified to three grades: no PAI, PAI positive within 5 mm and PAI of >5 mm. If the estimated PAI was more than 5 mm on at least one side of the arch, we judged there to be a significant PAI. Brachytherapy was performed in 18 patients who were evaluated as not having significant PAI on TRUS. Intra-operative PAI was observed in one case, which was also detected with a fusion image. On the other hand, intra-operative PAI was not observed in one case that had been evaluated as having significant PAI with a fusion image. In the remaining three patients, TRUS suggested the presence of significant PAI, which was also confirmed by a fusion image. Intra-operative PAI could be predicted by TRUS-CT fusion imaging, even when it was undetectable by TRUS.

However, it is difficult and laborious to visually identify and count all implanted seeds on the pelvic radiographs within a short time. Therefore, our purpose in this research was to develop an automated method for estimation of the number of implanted seeds based on two-view analysis of pelvic radiographs. First, the images of the seed candidates on the pelvic image were enhanced using a difference of Gaussian filter, and were identified by binarizing the enhanced image with a threshold value determined by multiple-gray level thresholding. Second, a simple rule-base method using ten image features was applied for false positive removal. Third, the candidates for the likely number of a multiply overlapping seed region, which may include one or more seeds, were estimated by a seed area histogram analysis and calculation of the probability of the likely number of overlapping seeds. As a result, the proposed method detected 99.9% of implanted seeds with 0.71 false positives per image on average in a test for training cases, and 99.2% with 0.32 false positives in a validation test. Moreover, the number of implanted seeds was estimated correctly at an overall recognition rate of 100% in the validation test using the proposed method. Therefore, the verification time for the number of implanted seeds could be reduced by the provision of several candidates for the likely number of seeds.""","""['Hidemichi Kawata', 'Hidetaka Arimura', 'Hiroaki Suefuji', 'Sunao Ohkura', 'Yoshifumi Saida', 'Kazutaka Nashiki', 'Kazuya Hayashida', 'Tomomi Kawahara', 'Ayumu Ohishi', 'Naofumi Hayabuchi']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""J Radiat Res""","""['Seed fixity in the prostate/periprostatic region following brachytherapy.', 'Incidence of seed migration to the chest, abdomen, and pelvis after transperineal interstitial prostate brachytherapy with loose (125)I seeds.', 'Prediction of seed migration after transperineal interstitial prostate brachytherapy with I-125 free seeds.', 'Pulmonary embolization of permanently implanted radioactive iodine-125 seeds for carcinoma of the prostate.', '125I seeds implantation plus pelvic lymphadenectomy in the management of localized prostate cancer.']"""

Genotoxic effects of the tested compounds were assessed in micronucleation assay. The presence of centromeres in the micronuclei and the multiplication of centrosomes were evaluated in fluorescence immunolabelled specimens. The inhibition of tubulin polymerization was measured spectrophotometrically. We found that both tested drugs were able to inhibit topoisomerase II activity; however, G21, in contrast to genistein, blocked this enzyme at the concentration far exceeding cytotoxic IC(50). We also found that both compounds caused micronucleation in DU 145 prostate cancer cells, but in contrast to genistein, G21 exhibited aneugenic activity, manifested by the presence of centromeres in micronuclei formed in cells treated with the drug. Aneugenic properties of G21 resulted from the inhibition of tubulin polymerization and centrosome disruption, not observed in the presence of genistein.

The homodimeric protease (PR) of XMRV plays a critical role in the production of functional viral proteins and is a prerequisite for viral replication. We synthesized XMRV PR using the wheat germ cell-free expression system and carried out structural analysis of XMRV PR in a complex with an inhibitor, amprenavir (APV), by means of NMR. Five different combinatorially (15)N-labeled samples were prepared and backbone resonance assignments were made by applying Otting's method, with which the amino acid types of the [(1)H, (15)N] HSQC resonances were automatically identified using the five samples (Wu et al., 2006) [14]. A titration experiment involving APV revealed that one APV molecule binds to one XMRV PR dimer. For many residues, two distinct resonances were observed, which is thought to be due to the structural heterogeneity between the two protomers in the APV:XMRV PR=1:2 complex. PR residues at the interface with APV have been identified on the basis of chemical shift perturbation and identification of the intermolecular NOEs by means of filtered NOE experiments. Interestingly, chemical shift heterogeneity between the two protomers of XMRV PR has been observed not only at the interface with APV but also in regions apart from the interface. This indicates that the structural heterogeneity induced by the asymmetry of the binding of APV to the XMRV PR dimer is transmitted to distant regions. This is in contrast to the case of the APV:HIV-1 PR complex, in which the structural heterogeneity is only localized at the interface. Long-range transmission of the structural change identified for the XMRV PR complex might be utilized for the discovery of a new type of drug.""","""['Ayako Furukawa', 'Hideyasu Okamura', 'Ryo Morishita', 'Satoko Matsunaga', 'Naohiro Kobayashi', 'Takahisa Ikegami', 'Tsutomu Kodaki', 'Akifumi Takaori-Kondo', 'Akihide Ryo', 'Takashi Nagata', 'Masato Katahira']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Biochem Biophys Res Commun""","""['Molecular and enzymatic characterization of XMRV protease by a cell-free proteolytic analysis.', 'Inhibition of XMRV and HIV-1 proteases by pepstatin A and acetyl-pepstatin.', 'Crystal structure of XMRV protease differs from the structures of other retropepsins.', 'Lack of evidence for a role of xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus in the pathogenesis of prostate cancer and/or chronic fatigue syndrome.', 'Evidence and controversies on the role of XMRV in prostate cancer and chronic fatigue syndrome.']"""

Their peptide ligands, the melanocortins, are α-, β- and γ-melanocyte-stimulating hormone and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) all of which are secreted from the anterior pituitary gland under hypothalamic control. MC2R binds ACTH but has no affinity for the other melanocortins and is, thereby, pharmacologically different from MCRs that bind those ligands. Evidence suggests that elevated GPCRs transactivate the androgen receptor (AR), the critical mediator of prostate cell growth, and consequently promote prostate cancer cell proliferation. It may be that reduced central melanocortin signaling is coincidental with reversal of prostate cancer cachexia, but no data are available on the expression of, or the role for, MCRs in prostate cancer. Here, we show that MCR (1-5) mRNAs are expressed in androgen-dependent LNCaP and androgen-independent PC3 and DU-145 human prostate cancer cell lines. Further, MC2R, the specific target of ACTH, is expressed in LNCaP, PC3 and DU-145 cells. Among the several synthetic MCR peptide ligands that we used, only ACTH promoted concentration-dependent cell proliferation in the three cell lines as shown by MTT cell proliferation assay. In LNCaP cells, the effect was additive with testosterone stimulation and was partially blunted with SHU9119, a non-selective MCR antagonist. In the same cells, ACTH induced cAMP production and increased AR nuclear labeling in immunocytochemical assays.

Objective:   To develop and validate a prediction tool for the risk of PCa 4 yr after an initially negative screen.  Design, setting, and participants:   We analyzed data from 15 791 screen-negative men aged 55-70 yr at the initial screening round of the Rotterdam section of the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Follow-up and repeat screening at 4 yr showed either no PCa, low-risk PCa, or potentially high-risk PCa (defined as clinical stage >T2b and/or biopsy Gleason score ≥ 7 and/or PSA ≥ 10.0 ng/ml). A multinomial logistic regression analysis included initial screening data on age, PSA, digital rectal examination (DRE), family history, prostate volume, and having had a previous negative biopsy. The 4-yr risk predictions were validated with additional follow-up data up to 8 yr after initial screening.  Results and limitations:   Positive family history and, especially, PSA level predicted PCa, whereas a previous negative biopsy or a large prostate volume reduced the likelihood of future PCa. The risk of having PCa 4 yr after an initially negative screen was 3.6% (interquartile range: 1.0-4.7%). Additional 8-yr follow-up data confirmed these predictions. Although data were based on sextant biopsies and a strict protocol-based biopsy indication, we suggest that men with a low predicted 4-yr risk (eg, ≤ 1.0%) could be rescreened at longer intervals or not at all, depending on competing risks, while men with an elevated 4-yr risk (eg, ≥ 5%) might benefit from immediate retesting. These findings need to be validated externally.

Design, setting, and participants:   G84E and 14 additional HOXB13 polymorphisms were genotyped in two population-based, Swedish, case-control samples (Cancer of the Prostate in Sweden [CAPS] and Stockholm-1) comprising 4693 controls and 5003 prostate cancer cases. CAPS collected data on patients and population controls nationally between 2001 and 2003. Stockholm-1 collected data on biopsy-positive patients and biopsy-negative controls in the Stockholm area between 2005 and 2007.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The outcome was pathologically verified prostate cancer. Relative and absolute risks among HOXB13 G84E mutation carriers were explored, as was the combined impact on disease risk of G84E and a polygenic score based on 33 established, common, low-risk variants.  Results and limitations:   HOXB13 G84E was observed in 1.3% of population controls and was strongly associated with prostate cancer risk (CAPS: odds ratio [OR]: 3.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.2-5.4; Stockholm-1: OR: 3.5; 95% CI, 2.4-5.2). The strongest association was observed for young-onset (OR: 8.6; 95% CI, 5.1-14.0) and hereditary (OR: 6.6; 95% CI, 3.3-12.0) prostate cancer. Haplotype analyses supported that G84E is a founder mutation. G84E carriers have an estimated 33% (95% CI, 23-46) cumulative risk to age 80 yr of prostate cancer, compared to 12% (95% CI, 11-13) among noncarriers. For G84E carriers within the top quartile of a polygenic score of established susceptibility variants, the cumulative risk was estimated at 48% (95% CI, 36-64).  Conclusions:   HOXB13 G84E is prevalent in >1% of the Swedish population and is associated with a 3.5-fold increased risk of prostate cancer. One-third of G84E carriers will be diagnosed with prostate cancer, which has implications for surveillance in mutation carriers.""","""['Robert Karlsson', 'Markus Aly', 'Mark Clements', 'Lilly Zheng', 'Jan Adolfsson', 'Jianfeng Xu', 'Henrik Grönberg', 'Fredrik Wiklund']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Prevalence of the HOXB13 G84E germline mutation in British men and correlation with prostate cancer risk, tumour characteristics and clinical outcomes.', 'HOXB13 G84E mutation in Finland: population-based analysis of prostate, breast, and colorectal cancer risk.', 'Homeobox B13 G84E Mutation and Prostate Cancer Risk.', 'Germline homeobox B13 (HOXB13) G84E mutation and prostate cancer risk in European descendants: a meta-analysis of 24,213 cases and 73, 631 controls.', 'Update on genetic predisposition to prostate cancer.', 'Genomic, epigenomic, and transcriptomic signatures of prostate cancer between African American and European American patients.', 'Identification of molecular subtypes and a prognostic signature based on chromatin regulators related genes in prostate cancer.', 'CanRisk-Prostate: A Comprehensive, Externally Validated Risk Model for the Prediction of Future Prostate Cancer.', 'Complexities of Prostate Cancer.', 'Germline Mutations in Patients With Early-Onset Prostate Cancer.']"""

This retrospective case-control study was designed to explore the relationship between dose to the apical/peri-apical regions of the urethra and development of brachytherapy (BXT)-related urethral stricture.  Materials and methods:   Cases were patients who developed urethral stricture after treatment with BXT as monotherapy and who had urethral dosimetry post-implant. Each case was matched with a control that had not developed urethral stricture. Dosimetry was compared between cases and controls.  Results:   Twenty-three cases were pair matched with 23 controls. There were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of age, presenting Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA), International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) or Gleason score. The dose delivered to the peri-apical and apical urethra was significantly higher for cases when compared with controls (peri-apical urethra: mean V(150) 1.1 Vs 0.8 cc [p=0.02]; apical urethra: mean dose 200 Vs 174 Gy [p=0.01]). The distance from the prostate apex to isodose lines was also found to be significant in predicting stricture formation.

Methods:   The localization of GOLM1 in prostate cancer cells was detected by immunofluorescence. The GOLM1 expression in prostate cancer cells at the mRNA and protein level was determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis, respectively. A prostate cancer tissue microarray was used to analyze GOLM1 protein expression by immunohistochemistry.  Results:   The immunofluorescence results demonstrated that GOLM1 was located at the cis-Golgi in the DU145 cells. GOLM1 transcripts and protein were overexpressed in a wide variety of prostate cancer cell lines (DU145, 22RV1, PC-3, and LNCaP). Tissue microarray immunohistochemistry demonstrated that GOLM1 protein staining was occasionally found in the normal prostate gland and benign prostatic hyperplasia, whereas that in prostate cancer was predominantly observed in the cytoplasm of tumor cells. GOLM1 protein was strongly expressed in prostate cancer tissues, and there was a significant difference compared with the normal prostate and benign prostatic hyperplasia cases (P < .05). There were no significant differences between GOLM1 overexpression and pathologic variables of prostate cancer, including histologic grade and pathologic stage (P > .05).  Conclusion:   Our results suggest that GOLM1 protein is significantly expressed in prostate cancer in comparison with the normal prostate gland and benign prostatic hyperplasia.

Design, setting, and participants:   From January 2010 to January 2011, 120 patients with organ-confined prostate cancer were enrolled and randomly assigned (using a randomisation plan) to one of two groups based on surgical approach: the RARP group and the LRP group.  Intervention:   All RARP and LRP interventions were performed with the same technique by the same single surgeon.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The demographic, perioperative, and pathologic results, such as the complications and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) measurements, were recorded and compared. Continence was evaluated at the time of catheter removal and 48 h later, and continence and potency were evaluated after 1, 3, 6, and 12 mo.

Objective:   To report outcomes of patients undergoing SC.  Design, setting, and participants:   A consecutive series of 396 patients who had failed either primary radiotherapy or cryosurgery underwent SC between October 1994 and August 2011.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Demographic and clinical parameters before primary and salvage treatment were evaluated; disease-free-survival (DFS), overall-survival (OS), disease-specific-survival (DSS), and complications were assessed.  Results and limitations:   Sufficient follow-up data were available for 328 patients. Median age was 65.8 yr (range: 45-81 yr), median serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level was 8.0 ng/ml (range: 0.6-290.0 ng/ml). After primary treatment, median time to recurrence was 55 mo (range: 0.0-183.6 mo). SC was performed at a median of 67.5 mo (range: 7.0-212.7 mo) later; median pre-SC PSA level was 4.0 ng/ml (range: 0.1-112.4 ng/ml). Median PSA nadir was 0.2 ng/ml (range: 0.01-70.70 ng/ml), reached after a median of 2.6 mo (range: 2.0-67.3 mo) after SC. Median follow-up was 47.8 mo (range: 1.6-203.5 mo).

In univariate analyses, time from primary treatment to SC or recurrence, PSA level before SC, and PSA nadir after SC were all significant predictors of recurrence (p ≤ 0.01). PSA before SC and time to recurrence were also predictive of DSS (p=0.003 and p=0.01, respectively). In multivariate analyses, only PSA nadir after SC was predictive of recurrence and DSS (p<0.001 and p=0.012, respectively). Complications were rare (range: 0.6-4.6%). Fifty-five patients (16.7%) underwent focal SC. Median PSA nadir after focal SC was 0.44 ng/ml (range: 0.04-20.1 ng/ml). Twenty-seven patients (49%) experienced recurrence. Respective 5- and 10-yr DFS was 47% and 42%; OS: 87% and 81%; and DSS: 100% and 83%.  Conclusions:   Our analysis confirms SC as an effective treatment option for patients failing primary therapy.

Systematic efforts to characterize such structural variants must effectively distinguish significant consensus events from random background aberrations. Here we introduce Significant Aberration in Cancer (SAIC), a new method for characterizing and assessing the statistical significance of recurrent CNA units. Three main features of SAIC include: (1) exploiting the intrinsic correlation among consecutive probes to assign a score to each CNA unit instead of single probes; (2) performing permutations on CNA units that preserve correlations inherent in the copy number data; and (3) iteratively detecting Significant Copy Number Aberrations (SCAs) and estimating an unbiased null distribution by applying an SCA-exclusive permutation scheme.  Results:   We test and compare the performance of SAIC against four peer methods (GISTIC, STAC, KC-SMART, CMDS) on a large number of simulation datasets. Experimental results show that SAIC outperforms peer methods in terms of larger area under the Receiver Operating Characteristics curve and increased detection power. We then apply SAIC to analyze structural genomic aberrations acquired in four real cancer genome-wide copy number data sets (ovarian cancer, metastatic prostate cancer, lung adenocarcinoma, glioblastoma). When compared with previously reported results, SAIC successfully identifies most SCAs known to be of biological significance and associated with oncogenes (e.g., KRAS, CCNE1, and MYC) or tumor suppressor genes (e.g., CDKN2A/B). Furthermore, SAIC identifies a number of novel SCAs in these copy number data that encompass tumor related genes and may warrant further studies.  Conclusions:   Supported by a well-grounded theoretical framework, SAIC has been developed and used to identify SCAs in various cancer copy number data sets, providing useful information to study the landscape of cancer genomes. Open-source and platform-independent SAIC software is implemented using C++, together with R scripts for data formatting and Perl scripts for user interfacing, and it is easy to install and efficient to use.

General practitioners (GPs) are expected to inform their patients about risks and benefits of screening before undergoing a PSA test. Ideally, this information corresponds to the model of informed decision making (IDM).The aim of this qualitative pilot-study is to explore factors, which gain insight into GPs' practice of counselling about the PSA test.  Methods:   This qualitative pilot study involves 5 focus groups with 30 GPs and 4 internists and in-depth interviews with 8 GPs. Both the discussions and the interviews were audio-taped, transcribed verbatim, and qualitatively analysed. Data were analysed by using typological analysis and qualitative content analysis as methodological approaches and by means of the software MAXqda.  Results:   The results of the in-depth interviews show 2 groups of GPs which can be classified by frequency of performing a PSA test: (i) routine screeners, who recommend PSA testing to all patients of 50 years and older, and (ii) non-routine screeners, who inform the patients only if they formally wish it. In-depth interviews as well as focus groups reveal that risks and adverse effects are rarely reported in GP counselling. More often they discuss the potential benefit of the testing. They regard balanced information as unacceptable for both the GP and the patient. Influencing factors concerning the patient (cognitive and emotional demand, preference of the authoritarian doctor, discouraging), factors concerning the GP (own belief in the efficacy of PSA screening, lack of knowledge) and structural factors (lack of time, lack of remuneration) were detected.  Conclusion:   The results indicate a selective presentation of aspects of screening for prostate cancer within the GP practice of counselling, which seem to overvalue the benefits of the screening and undervalue the associated risks of the PSA test. It should be made clear that the aim - the implementation of informed decision making (IDM) within the context of counselling about PSA test - within the Austrian Periodic Health Examination has not yet been put into practice. Results show that it is necessary to improve GPs' practice of communication, for example, by integrating IDM into the context of GPs' continuous training.""","""['G Malli']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Gesundheitswesen""","""[""The PSA testing dilemma: GPs' reports of consultations with asymptomatic men: a qualitative study."", ""PSA screening in New Zealand: total population results and general practitioners' current attitudes and practices."", ""Does 'peer coaching' increase GP capacity to promote informed decision making about PSA screening?

In this study, the effectiveness of Tomotherapy's 4-dof bony anatomy-based autoregistration was compared with the idealized 4-dof PTV contour-based optimization.  Results:   The maximum DTA (maxDTA) of the bony anatomy-based autoregistration was 3.2 ± 1.9 mm, with the maximum value of 8.0 mm. The maxDTA of the contour-based optimization was 1.8 ± 1.3 mm, with the maximum value of 5.7 mm. Comparison of Pearson correlation of the compensating parameters between the 2 4-dof optimization algorithms shows that there is a small but statistically significant correlation in y and z (0.236 and 0.300, respectively), whereas there is very weak correlation in x and roll (0.062 and 0.025, respectively).  Conclusions:   We find that there is an average improvement of approximately 1 mm in terms of maxDTA on the PTV going from 4-dof bony anatomy-based autoregistration to the 4-dof contour-based optimization. Pearson correlation analysis of the 2 4-dof optimizations suggests that uncertainties due to deformation and inadequate resolution account for much of the compensating parameters, but pitch variation also makes a statistically significant contribution.""","""['Steve Suh', 'Timothy E Schultheiss']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Dosimetric effects of the prone and supine positions on image guided localized prostate cancer radiotherapy.', 'Evaluation of the accuracy of a 3D surface imaging system for patient setup in head and neck cancer radiotherapy.', 'Adaptive image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT) eliminates the risk of biochemical failure caused by the bias of rectal distension in prostate cancer treatment planning: clinical evidence.', 'Use of deformed intensity distributions for on-line modification of image-guided IMRT to account for interfractional anatomic changes.', 'Simultaneous beam geometry and intensity map optimization in intensity-modulated radiation therapy.', 'Effects of megavoltage computed tomographic scan methodology on setup verification and adaptive dose calculation in helical TomoTherapy.']"""

Methods:   Three groups of men treated with intensity modulated RT or 3-dimensional conformal RT (75.6-78 Gy) from 1993-2008 for prostate cancer were categorized as (1) 326 intermediate-risk patients treated with RT alone, (2) 218 intermediate-risk patients treated with RT and ≤6 months of ADT, and (3) 274 low-risk patients treated with definitive RT. Median follow-up was 58 months. Recursive partitioning analysis based on FFF using Gleason score (GS), T stage, and pretreatment PSA concentration was applied to the intermediate-risk patients treated with RT alone. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate 5-year FFF.  Results:   Based on recursive partitioning analysis, intermediate-risk patients treated with RT alone were divided into 3 prognostic groups: (1) 188 favorable patients: GS 6, ≤T2b or GS 3+4, ≤T1c; (2) 71 marginal patients: GS 3+4, T2a-b; and (3) 68 unfavorable patients: GS 4+3 or T2c disease. Hazard ratios (HR) for recurrence in each group were 1.0, 2.1, and 4.6, respectively. When intermediate-risk patients treated with RT alone were compared to intermediate-risk patients treated with RT and ADT, the greatest benefit from ADT was seen for the unfavorable intermediate-risk patients (FFF, 74% vs 94%, respectively; P=.005). Favorable intermediate-risk patients had no significant benefit from the addition of ADT to RT (FFF, 94% vs 95%, respectively; P=.85), and FFF for favorable intermediate-risk patients treated with RT alone approached that of low-risk patients treated with RT alone (98%).  Conclusions:   Patients with favorable intermediate-risk prostate cancer did not benefit from the addition of ADT to dose-escalated RT, and their FFF was nearly as good as patients with low-risk disease. In patients with GS 4+3 or T2c disease, the addition of ADT to dose-escalated RT did improve FFF.""","""['Katherine O Castle', 'Karen E Hoffman', 'Lawrence B Levy', 'Andrew K Lee', 'Seungtaek Choi', 'Quynh N Nguyen', 'Steven J Frank', 'Thomas J Pugh', 'Sean E McGuire', 'Deborah A Kuban']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['High-dose radiotherapy with or without androgen deprivation therapy for intermediate-risk prostate cancer: cancer control and toxicity outcomes.', 'The addition of low-dose-rate brachytherapy and androgen-deprivation therapy decreases biochemical failure and prostate cancer death compared with dose-escalated external-beam radiation therapy for high-risk prostate cancer.', 'Improved biochemical relapse-free survival with increased external radiation doses in patients with localized prostate cancer: the combined experience of nine institutions in patients treated in 1994 and 1995.', 'Association of radiotherapy and hormonotherapy in locally advanced prostate cancer.', 'Short-term androgen deprivation therapy for patients with intermediate-risk prostate cancer undergoing dose-escalated radiotherapy: the standard of care?', 'Neoadjuvant versus Concurrent Androgen Deprivation Therapy in Localized Prostate Cancer Treated with Radiotherapy: A Systematic Review of the Literature.', 'Combining androgen deprivation and radiation therapy in the treatment of localised prostate cancer: Summary of level 1 evidence and current gaps in knowledge.', 'Trends in Androgen Deprivation Use in Men With Intermediate-Risk Prostate Cancer Who Underwent Radiation Therapy.', 'Active surveillance for intermediate-risk prostate cancer.', 'Long-term biochemical progression-free survival following brachytherapy for prostate cancer: Further insight into the role of short-term androgen deprivation and intermediate risk group subclassification.']"""

Temporal trends in specific causes of death among prostate cancer patients have not been well described.  Methods:   We analyzed causes of death among all incident prostate cancer cases recorded in the nationwide Swedish Cancer Registry (1961-2008; n = 210 112) and in the US Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program (1973-2008; n = 490 341). We calculated the cumulative incidence of death due to seven selected causes that accounted for more than 80% of the reported deaths (including ischemic heart disease and non-prostate cancer) and analyzed mortality trends by calendar year and age at diagnosis and length of follow-up.  Results:   During follow-up through 2008, prostate cancer accounted for 52% of all reported deaths in Sweden and 30% of reported deaths in the United States among men with prostate cancer; however, only 35% of Swedish men and 16% of US men diagnosed with prostate cancer died from this disease. In both populations, the cumulative incidence of prostate cancer-specific death declined during follow-up, while the cumulative incidences of death from ischemic heart disease and non-prostate cancer remained constant. The 5-year cumulative incidence of death from prostate cancer among all men was 29% in Sweden and 11% in the United States.  Conclusions:   In Sweden and the United States, men diagnosed with prostate cancer are less likely to die from prostate cancer than from another cause. Because many of these other causes of death are preventable through changes in lifestyle, interventions that target lifestyle factors should be integrated into prostate cancer management.""","""['Mara M Epstein', 'Gustaf Edgren', 'Jennifer R Rider', 'Lorelei A Mucci', 'Hans-Olov Adami']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""J Natl Cancer Inst""","""['Prostate cancer: Proponents of PSA screening boosted by new study.', 'Cancer surveillance series: interpreting trends in prostate cancer--part II: Cause of death misclassification and the recent rise and fall in prostate cancer mortality.', 'Outcomes in localized prostate cancer: National Prostate Cancer Register of Sweden follow-up study.', 'What do prostate cancer patients die of?', 'Annual report to the nation on the status of cancer, 1975-2000, featuring the uses of surveillance data for cancer prevention and control.', 'Prostate cancer in young men: an important clinical entity.', 'Safety, Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Evaluation of Teverelix for the Treatment of Hormone-Sensitive Advanced Prostate Cancer: Phase 2 Loading-Dose-Finding Studies.', 'Cause of Death among Long-Term Cancer Survivors: The NANDE Study.', 'Androgen-deprivation therapy with leuprolide increases abdominal adiposity without causing cardiac dysfunction in middle-aged male mice: effect of sildenafil.', 'The Effect of Age on Prostate Cancer Survival.', 'Causes of Death Among Prostate Cancer Patients Aged 40 Years and Older in the United States.']"""

Material and methods:   In total, 327 consecutive patients with prostate cancer who underwent radical prostatectomy (144 with LRP and 183 with RALRP) were enrolled. No significant differences were found in prostate-specific antigen level, biopsy Gleason score, clinical T stage or D'Amico risk stratification between the two groups. The operating time was longer in the LRP group (p < 0.001). The RALRP group patients had significantly lower postoperative pain numerical rating scale (NRS) (p = 0.016) and catheter duration (p < 0.001). There were no differences in pathological Gleason score, pathological T stage or positive surgical margin rate. No differences were found in biochemical recurrence-free survival. Postoperative pad-free continence rates revealed a more rapid recovery in the RALRP group, but rates at 12 months were not significantly different. Multivariate analysis showed that the type of surgery was a strong independent factor to predict early postoperative pad use. Postoperative potency rates were not significantly different at 3, 6 and 12 months in patients who underwent nerve-sparing procedures.  Conclusions:   LRP and RALRP performed by a single surgeon yielded similar results in terms of safety and oncological outcomes. More favorable outcomes were noted in operating time, pain NRS and catheter duration, as well as urinary continence recovery time.

We analyzed how the increasing prevalence of MIP has affected the outcomes of MIP and open radical prostatectomy (RRP).  Methods:   In the Nationwide Inpatient Sample, 23,473 patients undergoing MIP and 118,266 undergoing RRP between 2002 and 2008 are reported. We analyzed length of stay (LOS), hospital charges (THC), complication rates (CR), and socioeconomic characteristics. We used the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) to identify complication rates (RRP n=666, and MIP n=2205).  Results:   The proportion of MIP increased from 1.4% in 2002 to 29.5% in 2008. Mean LOS decreased for MIP (2.4 days in 2002, 1.6 days in 2008) and RRP (3.1 days in 2002, 2.1 days in 2008). Mean THC for MIP decreased ($46k in 2002, $34k in 2008) and increased for RRP ($18k in 2002, $32k in 2008). After 2005, overall CRs of MIP were lower than for RRP. High-volume centers reported lower CRs for both procedures. MIP was associated with fewer transfusions and wound complications. Men living in ZIP codes with the top quartile of yearly mean household income were more likely to undergo MIP than RRP (P<0.001). Although there were more white patients receiving MIP and black or Hispanic patients more frequently underwent RRP, there was no statistically significant difference.  Conclusions:   Increasing use of MIP led to decreased hospital stay for all patients, increase charges for RRP, and decreased CRs for both MIP and RRP. In recent years, MIP was associated with fewer complications. Charges for RRP have increased over time to approach those for MIP, and patients with increased socio-economic status were more likely to undergo MIP.""","""['Matthias D Hofer', 'Joshua J Meeks', 'John Cashy', 'Shilajit Kundu', 'Lee C Zhao']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Endourol""","""['Cost comparison of robotic, laparoscopic, and open radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer.', 'Comparative hospital cost-analysis of open and robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'National multi-institutional comparison of 30-day postoperative complication and readmission rates between open retropubic radical prostatectomy and robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy using NSQIP.', 'Costs of radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer: a systematic review.', 'Robot assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy in 2013.', 'Application of artificial intelligence in screening for adverse perinatal outcomes: A protocol for systematic review.', 'Trends in the diffusion of robotic surgery in prostate, uterus, and colorectal procedures: a retrospective population-based study.', 'A census of laparoscopic and robotic urological practice: a survey of minimally invasive surgery department of the Brazilian Society of Urology.', 'Medical Travel among Non-Seoul Residents to Seek Prostate Cancer Treatment in Medical Facilities of Seoul.', 'Trends in the diffusion of robotic surgery: A retrospective observational study.']"""

Patients and methods:   Between July 2011 and January 2012, 110 RALP were performed by one of two surgeons, each with previous experience of more than 1000 LRP. The cases were pair matched from among the last 208 patients who had undergone LRP by the same surgeons at the same time. The clinical parameters, operative details, postoperative complications, and short-term outcomes from these patients, collected prospectively, were compared between the two groups.  Results:   The prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level and age of the two groups was similar. The operative time (128.4 vs 153.9 min; P=0.01) and blood loss (200 vs 254 mL; P=0.01) was significantly less for the LRP group, but the duration of catheterization was similar (5.89 vs 6.2 days). The complication rate was low. No procedures needed conversions, and no patient had a visceral injury or blood transfusion. Twenty-three patients in the LRP group and 33 patients in the RALP group had extraprostatic disease, and the positive margin rate was 14% and 19% for these respective groups. At 3 months, PSA level was undetectable in 94% of LRP and 92% RALP patients, while 56% and 65% (P=0.062) patients in these groups were using 0 to 2 pads per day.

Polychotomous logistic regression analysis was used to predict the probability of each pathologic stage category: organ-confined disease (OC), extraprostatic extension (EPE), seminal vesicle involvement (SV+), or lymph node involvement (LN+) based on preoperative criteria. Preoperative variables included biopsy Gleason score (6, 3+4, 4+3, 8, and 9-10), serum PSA (0-2.5, 2.6-4.0, 4.1-6.0, 6.1-10.0, greater than 10.0 ng/mL), and clinical stage (T1c, T2c, and T2b/T2c). Bootstrap re-sampling with 1000 replications was performed to estimate 95% confidence intervals for predicted probabilities of each pathologic state.  Results:   The median PSA was 4.9 ng/mL, 63% had Gleason 6 disease, and 78% of men had T1c disease. 73% of patients had OC disease, 23% had EPE, 3% had SV+ but not LN+, and 1% had LN+ disease. Compared to the previous Partin nomogram, there was no change in the distribution of pathologic state. The risk of LN+ disease was significantly higher for tumours with biopsy Gleason 9-10 than Gleason 8 (O.R. 3.2, 95% CI 1.3-7.6). The c-indexes for EPE vs. OC, SV+ vs. OC, and LN+ vs. OC were 0.702, 0.853, and 0.917, respectively. Men with biopsy Gleason 4+3 and Gleason 8 had similar predicted probabilities for all pathologic stages. Most men presenting with Gleason 6 disease or Gleason 3+4 disease have <2% risk of harboring LN+ disease and may have lymphadenectomy omitted at RP.

In this study, we attempted to regenerate the damaged cavernous nerve (CN), which is the main cause of ED. We investigated the effectiveness of human adipose-derived stem cell (hADSC) and nerve growth factor-incorporated hyaluronic acid-based hydrogel (NGF-hydrogel) application on the CN in a rat model of bilateral cavernous nerve crush injury. Four weeks after the operation, erectile function was assessed by detecting the intracavernous pressure (ICP)/arterial pressure level by CN electrostimulation. The ICP was significantly increased by application of hADSC with NGF-hydrogel compared to the other experimental groups. CN and penile tissue were collected for histological examination. PKH-26 labeled hADSC colocalized with beta III tubulin were shown in CN tissue sections. hADSC/NGF-hydrogel treatment prevented smooth muscle atrophy in the corpus cavernosum.

After 4 weeks, the tumor nude mouse models were randomly assigned into five groups. ³²P-CP-PLLA seeds (3.7, 7.4, 14.8, and 0 MBq) and ³²P-CP (14.8 MBq) were implanted in the tumor tissues of the nude mouse models. The following were discussed in this study: (1) the distributions of ³²P-CP-PLLA, (2) the pathological and morphological changes in the tumor and regional lymph nodes, and (3) the changes in white blood cell (WBC) and platelet counts in peripheral blood for toxic reactions. The homemade ³²P-CP-PLLA seed was a regular green cylinder, with an even distribution of mass and radioactivity. After implantation, single-photon emission computed tomograph (SPECT) showed that ³²P was mainly gathered in the tumor and regional lymph nodes. Morphological examinations revealed that necrosis and hemorrhage were around the tumor and focal lymph nodes. The tumor inhibition rates of the five groups were 70.16% ± 5.48%, 80.18% ± 5.84%, 84.97% ± 4.79%, (-), and 78.81% ± 3.13%, respectively. These values were all positive when compared with the control group. As a new homemade agent of pure β-ray, local implantation of the agent increased the focal retention of radioactivity at the target. Moreover, effective half-life showed an obvious damage to the tumor and metastatic foci of Pca.""","""['Xingjun He', 'Ruipeng Jia', 'Luwei Xu', 'Kai Liang', 'Zizheng Wang', 'Guoqiang Shao', 'Peilin Huang', 'Wencheng Li']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Cancer Biother Radiopharm""","""['Investigation of Newly Prepared Biodegradable 32P-chromic Phosphate-polylactide-co-glycolide Seeds and Their Therapeutic Response Evaluation for Glioma Brachytherapy.', 'Implantation brachytherapy with 32P-chromic phosphate-poly (L-lactide) delayed-release particles for prostate cancer in nude mice.', 'Antitumor effects of 32P-chromic-poly (L-lactide) brachytherapy in nude mice with human prostate cancer.', 'Preliminary study of the biodegradation and the correlation between in vitro and in vivo release of (32)P-chromic phosphate-poly(L-lactide) seeds.', 'Experimental study of CT guided ³²P-CP-PLLA microparticle implantation in the treatment of rabbit VX2 lung tumor.', 'Investigation of Newly Prepared Biodegradable 32P-chromic Phosphate-polylactide-co-glycolide Seeds and Their Therapeutic Response Evaluation for Glioma Brachytherapy.']"""
