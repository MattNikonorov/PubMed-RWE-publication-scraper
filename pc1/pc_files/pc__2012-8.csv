While reduced levels of PG have been reported in localized and hormone refractory prostate tumors, the functional significance of these changes is unknown. Here we report that PG expression is reduced in samples of a prostate tumor tissue array and inversely correlated with advancing tumor potential in 7 PCa cell lines. Ectopically expressed PG enhanced intercellular adhesive strength, and attenuated the motility and invasion of aggressive cell lines, whereas silencing PG in less tumorigenic cells had the opposite effect. PG also regulated cell-substrate adhesion and motility through extracellular matrix (ECM)-dependent inhibition of Src kinase, suggesting that PG's effects were not due solely to increased intercellular adhesion. PG silencing resulted in elevated levels of the ECM protein vitronectin (VN), and exposing PG-expressing cells to VN induced Src activity. Furthermore, increased VN levels and Src activation correlated with diminished expression of PG in patient tissues. Thus, PG may inhibit Src by keeping VN low. Our results suggest that loss of intercellular adhesion due to reduced PG expression might be exacerbated by activation of Src through a PG-dependent mechanism. Furthermore, PG down-regulation during PCa progression could contribute to the known VN-dependent promotion of PCa invasion and metastasis, demonstrating a novel functional interaction between desmosomal cell-cell adhesion and cell-substrate adhesion signaling axes in prostate cancer.""","""['Carrie A Franzen', 'Viktor Todorović', 'Bhushan V Desai', 'Salida Mirzoeva', 'Ximing J Yang', 'Kathleen J Green', 'Jill C Pelling']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Mechanisms of plakoglobin-dependent adhesion: desmosome-specific functions in assembly and regulation by epidermal growth factor receptor.', 'Plakoglobin regulates cell motility through Rho- and fibronectin-dependent Src signaling.', 'Plakoglobin suppresses keratinocyte motility through both cell-cell adhesion-dependent and -independent mechanisms.', 'Analysis of desmosomal cadherin-adhesive function and stoichiometry of desmosomal cadherin-plakoglobin complexes.', 'Plakophilins in desmosomal adhesion and signaling.', 'Desmosomal proteins of DSC2 and PKP1 promote cancer cells survival and metastasis by increasing cluster formation in circulatory system.', 'Opposing prognostic relevance of junction plakoglobin in distinct prostate cancer patient subsets.', 'Adherens Junctions and Desmosomes Coordinate Mechanics and Signaling to Orchestrate Tissue Morphogenesis and Function: An Evolutionary Perspective.', 'Beyond cell-cell adhesion: Plakoglobin and the regulation of tumorigenesis and metastasis.', 'Mice with Hepatic Loss of the Desmosomal Protein γ-Catenin Are Prone to Cholestatic Injury and Chemical Carcinogenesis.']"""

Here we describe an in vivo mouse model that recapitulates the most frequent rearrangement in prostate cancer, the fusion of the promoter region of TMPRSS2 with the coding region of the transcription factor, ERG. A recombinant bacterial artificial chromosome including an extended TMPRSS2 promoter driving genomic ERG was constructed and used for transgenesis in mice. TMPRSS2-ERG expression was evaluated in tissue sections and FACS-fractionated prostate cell populations. In addition to the anticipated expression in luminal cells, TMPRSS2-ERG was similarly expressed in the Sca-1(hi)/EpCAM(+) basal/progenitor fraction, where expanded numbers of clonogenic self-renewing progenitors were found, as assayed by in vitro sphere formation. These clonogenic cells increased intrinsic self renewal in subsequent generations. In addition, ERG dependent self-renewal and invasion in vitro was demonstrated in prostate cell lines derived from the model. Clinical studies have suggested that the TMPRSS2-ERG translocation occurs early in prostate cancer development. In the model described here, the presence of the TMPRSS2-ERG fusion alone was not transforming but synergized with heterozygous Pten deletion to promote PIN. Taken together, these data suggest that one function of TMPRSS2-ERG is the expansion of self-renewing cells, which may serve as targets for subsequent mutations. Primary prostate epithelial cells demonstrated increased post transcriptional turnover of ERG compared to the TMPRSS2-ERG positive VCaP cell line, originally isolated from a prostate cancer metastasis. Finally, we determined that TMPRSS2-ERG expression occurred in both castration-sensitive and resistant prostate epithelial subpopulations, suggesting the existence of androgen-independent mechanisms of TMPRSS2 expression in prostate epithelium.""","""['Orla M Casey', 'Lei Fang', 'Paul G Hynes', 'Wassim G Abou-Kheir', 'Philip L Martin', 'Heather S Tillman', 'Gyorgy Petrovics', 'Hibah O Awwad', 'Yvona Ward', 'Ross Lake', 'Luhua Zhang', 'Kathleen Kelly']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Role of the TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion in prostate cancer.', 'Loss of FOXO1 Cooperates with TMPRSS2-ERG Overexpression to Promote Prostate Tumorigenesis and Cell Invasion.', 'TMPRSS2:ERG blocks neuroendocrine and luminal cell differentiation to maintain prostate cancer proliferation.', 'The progress of TMPRSS2-ETS gene fusions and their mechanism in prostate cancer.', 'Current mouse and cell models in prostate cancer research.', 'ETV4 mediates dosage-dependent prostate tumor initiation and cooperates with p53 loss to generate prostate cancer.', 'TMPRSS2-ERG promotes the initiation of prostate cancer by suppressing oncogene-induced senescence.', 'ETS factors in prostate cancer.', 'ETV4 promotes late development of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and cell proliferation through direct and p53-mediated downregulation of p21.', 'From genomics to functions: preclinical mouse models for understanding oncogenic pathways in prostate cancer.']"""

The purpose of this study was to determine the role of pancreatic cancer-associated fibroblasts (human pancreatic stellate cells, HPSCs) in Hh signaling. In addition, we evaluated the efficacy of a novel Hh antagonist, AZD8542, on tumor progression with an emphasis on the role of the stroma compartment.  Experimental design:   Expression of Hh pathway members and activation of the Hh pathway were analyzed in both HPSCs and pancreatic cancer cells. We tested the effects of Smoothened (SMO) inhibition with AZD8542 on tumor growth in vivo using an orthotopic model of pancreatic cancer containing varying amounts of stroma.  Results:   HPSCs expressed high levels of SMO receptor and low levels of Hh ligands, whereas cancer cells showed the converse expression pattern. HPSC proliferation was stimulated by Sonic Hedgehog with upregulation of downstream GLI1 mRNA. These effects were abrogated by AZD8542 treatment. In an orthotopic model of pancreatic cancer, AZD8542 inhibited tumor growth only when HPSCs were present, implicating a paracrine signaling mechanism dependent on stroma. Further evidence of paracrine signaling of the Hh pathway in prostate and colon cancer models is provided, demonstrating the broader applicability of our findings.  Conclusion:   Based on the use of our novel human-derived pancreatic cancer stellate cells, our results suggest that Hh-targeted therapies primarily affect the tumor-associated stroma, rather than the epithelial compartment.""","""['Rosa F Hwang', 'Todd T Moore', 'Maureen Mertens Hattersley', 'Meghan Scarpitti', 'Bin Yang', 'Erik Devereaux', 'Vijaya Ramachandran', 'Thiruvengadam Arumugam', 'Baoan Ji', 'Craig D Logsdon', 'Jeffrey L Brown', 'Robert Godin']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Res""","""['TAK-441, a novel investigational smoothened antagonist, delays castration-resistant progression in prostate cancer by disrupting paracrine hedgehog signaling.', 'A novel synthetic smoothened antagonist transiently inhibits pancreatic adenocarcinoma xenografts in a mouse model.', 'Tumor-stroma interaction in orthotopic primary pancreatic cancer xenografts during hedgehog pathway inhibition.', 'The Role of Smoothened in Cancer.', 'Paracrine sonic hedgehog signaling derived from tumor epithelial cells: a key regulator in the pancreatic tumor microenvironment.', 'Fibroblasts as Turned Agents in Cancer Progression.', 'Combined treatments with AZD5363, AZD8542, curcumin or resveratrol induce death of human glioblastoma cells by suppressing the PI3K/AKT and SHH signaling pathways.', 'Signaling pathways in cancer-associated fibroblasts: recent advances and future perspectives.', 'Therapeutic Potential of Targeting Stromal Crosstalk-Mediated Immune Suppression in Pancreatic Cancer.', 'The molecular biology of pancreatic adenocarcinoma: translational challenges and clinical perspectives.']"""

Between April 2005 and September 2009, 89 patients with T1c-2cN0M0 prostate cancer were treated with permanent I-125 seed implantation alone. The prostate prescription dose was 145 Gy, and the grade of rectal bleeding was scored according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0. Post-treatment planning was performed with fusion images of computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging 4-5 weeks after brachytherapy. Patient characteristics and dosimetric parameters were evaluated to determine risk factors for bleeding. The calculated parameters included the rectal volume in cubic centimeters that received >50-200% of the prescribed dose (RV50-200) and the minimal doses received by 1-30% of the rectal volume (RD1-30). The median follow-up time was 42 months (ranging 18-73 months). Grade 1 rectal bleeding occurred in 24 (27.0%) patients, but no Grade 2 or severe bleeding was observed. Usage of anticoagulants had a significant correlation with the occurrence of bleeding (P = 0.007). The RV100-150 and RD1-10 were significantly higher in patients with rectal bleeding than in those without bleeding. The RV100 was identified as a possible threshold value; the 3-year rectal bleeding rate in patients with an RV100 > 1.0 cm(3) was 36%, whereas that with an RV100 ≤ 1.0 cm(3) was 14% (P < 0.05).

Factors that influence PSA growth, however, are unclear. We evaluated associations of anthropometric and lifestyle factors with age-related PSA growth.  Methods:   Repeat PSA measures from 404 men, aged 50 to 69 years, with localized prostate cancer undergoing active monitoring were obtained. From log(PSA) measures, age-specific multilevel mixed effect linear models were developed to predict PSA at age 50 years and yearly increase in postdiagnosis PSA. Baseline anthropometric measures, alcohol consumption, occupational class, smoking status, and physical activity were added to the model as covariates.  Results:   The median number of repeat PSAs was 13 (range, 2-40), and the mean duration of follow-up was 4.8 years (SD, 2.3). The basic model of age-related PSA growth in men with localized prostate cancer estimated a mean PSA at age 50 of 3.95 ng/mL [95% confidence interval (CI): 3.55 to 4.39] and a yearly increase of 8.50% (95% CI: 7.90% to 9.10%). PSA at age 50 years was 2.1% lower per unit increase in weighted exercise score (95% CI: -3.3 to -0.8), 5.3% lower per 5 cm increase in height (95% CI: -9.4 to -1.1), and 24.5% higher (95% CI: 4.0 to 49.1) in current smokers than never smokers. Similar associations with PSA growth were seen.  Conclusion:   Smoking and exercise are modifiable lifestyle factors that may be associated with PSA levels in men with localized prostate cancer undergoing active monitoring/surveillance.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the expression of two genes that are regulators of the cell cycle, the p53 and p21 genes, in human non-transformed epithelial prostatic cells (HNTEPs) treated with different concentrations of hormones. Samples of prostate tissue were obtained from 10 patients between 60 and 77 years of age. HNTEP cells were grown in basal medium and treated with dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in different conditions for 4 h. A low concentration of DHT resulted in a significant increase in cell growth; this effect was eradicated by addition of the antiandrogen hydroxyflutamide. Furthermore, the low concentration of DHT induced lower mRNA levels in the p53 and p21 genes in HNTEP cells. In turn, high DHT concentrations induced a significant increase in the expression of the p53 and p21 genes. The present data suggest that the p53 and p21 genes play a role in the control of responsiveness and androgen dose-dependent cell proliferation in HNTEP cells.

Within the TTSPs, matriptase-2 is a relatively newly identified member and this protease has been shown to play a key role in cancer progression. β-catenin has long been regarded as an oncogene. The deregulation of the β-catenin signalling pathway plays a significant role in the progression and possibly the development of cancer. However, little is known about the role of matriptase-2 in prostate cancer. This study aimed to examine the correlation between matriptase-2 and β-catenin. Matriptase-2 was knocked down in the normal prostate cells, PZHPV7 and PNT2C2, using a ribozyme transgene targeting matriptase-2. The altered cells were used in a number of in vitro experiments designed to investigate the involvement of matriptase-2 with β-catenin and to further characterise its function. The knockdown of matriptase-2 had no effect on cell growth or adhesion but significantly reduced cell motility (PZHPV7 cells, p<0.001; PNT2C2 cells, p=0.001 vs. respective control cells) and invasive capability (PZHPV7 cells, p=0.001; PNT2C2 cells, p=0.007). The knockdown also caused a large increase in β-catenin protein expression at the cell membrane in PZHPV7 and PNT2C2 cells and a decrease in PC3 cells overexpressing matriptase-2, but did not affect the mRNA levels. Matriptase-2 may have an important impact on prostate cancer progression. The data gained from this study suggest that matriptase-2 protects against the development and progression of prostate cancer by regulating the motility and invasive capabilities of prostate cancer cells. Matriptase-2 also reduces the levels of β-catenin at the cell membrane. As β-catenin is highly involved in the regulation of cellular processes, including motility and invasion, the reduction of β-catenin expression by matriptase-2 may be a possible mechanism by which matriptase-2 functions.""","""['Siobhan L Webb', 'Andrew J Sanders', 'Malcolm D Mason', 'Wen G Jiang']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Oncol Rep""","""['Genetic upregulation of matriptase-2 reduces the aggressiveness of prostate cancer cells in vitro and in vivo and affects FAK and paxillin localisation.', 'Genetic reduction of matriptase-1 expression is associated with a reduction in the aggressive phenotype of prostate cancer cells in vitro and in vivo.', 'Curcumin-targeting pericellular serine protease matriptase role in suppression of prostate cancer cell invasion, tumor growth, and metastasis.', 'The type II transmembrane serine protease, matriptase-2: Possible links to cancer?', 'The role of type II transmembrane serine protease-mediated signaling in cancer.', 'Matriptase-2/NR4A3 axis switches TGF-β action toward suppression of prostate cancer cell invasion, tumor growth, and metastasis.', 'Transcriptome analysis reveals TMPRSS6 isoforms with distinct functionalities.', 'The role of TMPRSS6/matriptase-2 in iron regulation and anemia.', 'N-glycosylation is required for matriptase-2 autoactivation and ectodomain shedding.', 'Matriptase-2 inhibits HECV motility and tubule formation in vitro and tumour angiogenesis in vivo.']"""

Treatment of tumor bearing mice with AM inhibited the growth of the tumors investigated, with an inhibitory effect ranging from 40 to 69%. The AM had a comparable antitumor effect with 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin in the Colon-26 tumor model, and combined treatment with AM and 5-fluorouracil or cisplatin resulted in an enhanced tumor growth inhibitory effect. The AM induced apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway and induced G1 arrest in PC-3 cells and increased the number of apoptotic cells in PC-3 xenografts. These findings suggest that the AM might offer an interesting perspective in the treatment of cancer and in combination with other treatments may offer hope for a more effective cancer therapy.""","""['Gyula Kulcsár', 'Dezső Gaál', 'Péter I Kulcsár', 'Ákos Schulcz', 'Tamás Czömpöly']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Int J Cancer""","""['P276-00, a novel cyclin-dependent inhibitor induces G1-G2 arrest, shows antitumor activity on cisplatin-resistant cells and significant in vivo efficacy in tumor models.', 'Identification of Further Components of an Anticancer Defense System Composed of Small Molecules Present in the Serum.', 'Midazolam induces cellular apoptosis in human cancer cells and inhibits tumor growth in xenograft mice.', 'Characterization of the anticancer effects of S115, a novel heteroaromatic thiosemicarbazone compound, in vitro and in vivo.', 'Chidamide and 5-flurouracil show a\xa0synergistic antitumor effect on human colon cancer xenografts in nude mice.', 'Parsing the life-shortening effects of dietary protein: effects of individual amino acids.', 'Soy-Based Multiple Amino Acid Oral Supplementation Increases the Anti-Sarcoma Effect of Cyclophosphamide.', 'Tumor-dependent increase of serum amino acid levels in breast cancer patients has diagnostic potential and correlates with molecular tumor subtypes.']"""

Using this new compound, we delivered a specific siRNA designed to knockdown cofilin-1, a key protein in the regulation of cellular cytoskeleton, to human prostate cancer (PCa) cells. The carbon nanohorn (CNH) derivative was able to bind siRNA and release it in the presence of an excess of the polyanion heparin. Moreover, this hybrid nanomaterial protected the siRNA from RNAse-mediated degradation. Synthetic siRNA delivered to PCa cells by f-CNH3 decreased the cofilin-1 mRNA and protein levels to about 20% of control values. Docetaxel, the drug of choice for the treatment of PCa, produced a concentration-dependent activation of caspase-3, an increase in cell death assessed by lactate dehydrogenase release to the culture medium, cell cycle arrest and inhibition of tumor cell proliferation. All of these toxic effects were potentiated when cofilin-1 was down regulated in these cells by a siRNA delivered by the nanoparticle.

Design, setting, and participants:   A total of 852 men with advanced prostate cancer (PCa) were enrolled to receive goserelin acetate 3.6 mg every 28 d for 24 wk. A total of 554 patients whose prostate-specific antigen (PSA) decreased to <10 ng/ml or by ≥50% (<20 ng/ml at baseline) were randomised to IAD or CAD.  Intervention:   In the IAD arm, ADT was resumed for at least 24 wk whenever PSA increased >20 ng/ml or above baseline.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   QoL was monitored with a validated Cleary 30-item questionnaire and analysed by the Mann-Whitney U test, 0.5 standard deviation rule, and repeated measures analysis of variance.

In this study the GEC-ESTRO groups BRAPHYQS and PROBATE investigated the interobserver variability in post-implant prostate contouring, seed reconstruction and image fusion and its impact on the dose-volume parameters.  Materials:   Post-implant T2-TSE, T1-GE and CT images were acquired for three patients, in order to evaluate four post-plan techniques: (a) CT, (b) T1+T2, (c) CT+T2, (d) CT+T1(int)+T2. Three interobserver studies were set up. (1) Contouring: the CTV-prostate was delineated on CT and T2 by eight physicians. Additionally one reference contour was defined on both image modalities for each patient. (2) Seed reconstruction: seven physicists localised the seeds on T1 and CT, manually and with CT seed finder tools. A reference seed geometry was defined on CT and T1. (3) Fusion: six physicists registered the image sets for technique (b)-(d), using seeds (if visible) and anatomical landmarks. A reference fusion was determined for each combined technique.  Results:   (1) The SD(ref) for contouring (1 SD with respect to the reference volume) was largest for CT (23%), but also surprisingly large for MRI (17%). This resulted in large SD(ref) values for D90 for all techniques (17-23%). The surprisingly large SD(ref) for MRI was partly due to variations in interpretation of what to include in the prostate contour. (2) The SD(ref) in D90 for seed reconstruction was small (2%) for all techniques, except for T1+T2 (7%). (3) The SD(ref) in D90 due to image fusion was quite large, especially for direct fusion of CT+T2 (16%) where clearly corresponding landmarks were missing (seeds hardly visible on T2). In general, we observed large differences in D90 depending on the technique used.

Screening for cancer of the prostate (CaP) with prostate-specific antigen has been questioned because of its modest impact on survival in two randomized trials. Its impact on the metastatic disease burden in a population was not assessed. To account for lead-time bias, we compared the 10-year metastasis-free survival rate for the prescreening era group (PRE) to the 15-year metastases-free survival rate of the postscreening era group (POST).  Methods:   From 1986 to 1996, a total of 1721 CaP patients were definitively treated at our institution. The cohort was divided into PRE (1986-1992; n = 575) and POST (1993-1996; n = 1146). PRE patients were censored at 10 years, and POST patients were censored at 15 years. The 10- and 15-year metastasis-free survival rate and the characteristics associated with the risk of developing metastatic disease were assessed.  Results:   Median follow up for all patients was 10 years (range 0.1-15 years), 9.6 years (range 0.1-10 years) for PRE, and 10.25 years (range 0.1-15 years) for POST. The 10-year PRE versus 15-year POST metastasis-free survival rate was 58% versus 65% for high-risk (P < .0001), 79% versus 86% for intermediate-risk (P < .0001), and 90% versus 96% (P = .0001) for low-risk patients. On multivariable analysis, screening era (P < .0001, hazard ratio = 4.2, 95% confidence interval = 3.1-5.7), T-stage, biopsy Gleason score, and post-treatment prostate-specific antigen testing frequency were significant for the development of metastatic disease.

Snail transcription factor is a zinc finger protein that is increased in breast cancer and is associated with increased tumor motility and invasion by induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). We investigated the molecular mechanisms by which Snail increases tumor motility and invasion utilizing prostate cancer cells.  Methods:   Expression levels were analyzed by RT-PCR and western blot analyses. Cell motility and invasion assays were performed, while Snail regulation and binding to maspin promoter was analyzed by luciferase reporter and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays.  Results:   Snail protein expression was higher in different prostate cancer cells lines as compared to normal prostate epithelial cells, which correlated inversely with maspin expression. Snail overexpression in 22Rv1 prostate cancer cells inhibited maspin expression and led to increased migration and invasion. Knockdown of Snail in DU145 and C4-2 cancer cells resulted in up-regulation of maspin expression, concomitant with decreased migration. Transfection of Snail into 22Rv1 or LNCaP cells inhibited maspin promoter activity, while stable knockdown of Snail in C4-2 cells increased promoter activity. ChIP analysis showed that Snail is recruited to the maspin promoter in 22Rv1 cells.  Conclusions:   Overall, this is the first report showing that Snail can negatively regulate maspin expression by directly repressing maspin promoter activity, leading to increased cell migration and invasion. Therefore, therapeutic targeting of Snail may be useful to re-induce expression of maspin tumor suppressor and prevent prostate cancer tumor progression.""","""['Corey L Neal', 'Veronica Henderson', 'Bethany N Smith', 'Danielle McKeithen', 'Tisheeka Graham', 'Baohan T Vo', 'Valerie A Odero-Marah']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Snail promotes cell migration through PI3K/AKT-dependent Rac1 activation as well as PI3K/AKT-independent pathways during prostate cancer progression.', 'The glycosyltransferase LARGE2 is repressed by Snail and ZEB1 in prostate cancer.', 'MnSOD up-regulates maspin tumor suppressor gene expression in human breast and prostate cancer cells.', 'Tumor suppressor maspin as a rheostat in HDAC regulation to achieve the fine-tuning of epithelial homeostasis.', 'The role of Snail in prostate cancer.', 'Integrating the tumor-suppressive activity of Maspin with p53 in retuning the epithelial homeostasis: A working hypothesis and applicable prospects.', 'Biomarkers of Response to Neoadjuvant Androgen Deprivation in Localised Prostate Cancer.', 'SNAIL Transctiption factor in prostate cancer cells promotes neurite outgrowth.', 'Prostatic Carcinogenesis: More Insights.', 'Fibroblast growth factor\xa018 promotes the growth, migration and invasion of MDA‑MB‑231 cells.']"""

The aim of the present investigation was to identify the transcription factor that mediates melatonin's up-regulatory effect on p27(Kip1) in LNCaP and 22Rv1 prostate cancer cells. Deletion mapping and reporter assays of the p27(Kip1) promoter revealed that the putative melatonin-responsive transcription factor binds to a 116 base-pair region of the promoter sequence, which contains a potential nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) binding site. When the NF-κB binding site was abolished by site-directed mutagenesis, the stimulatory effect of melatonin on p27(Kip1) promoter activity was mitigated. Notably, melatonin inhibited the DNA binding of activated NF-κB via MT1 receptor-induced PKA and PKC stimulation. Furthermore, melatonin's up-regulatory effect on p27(Kip1) transcription and consequent cell antiproliferation were abrogated by NF-κB activator but mimicked by NF-κB inhibitor. The results indicate that inhibition of constitutively active NF-κB via melatonin MT1 receptor-induced dual activation of (Gα(s)) PKA and (Gα(q)) PKC can de-repress the p27(Kip1) promoter leading to transcriptional up-regulation of p27(Kip1).

Methods:   All cancer centres in Germany that were re-certified in 2010 provided data documenting how many patients with primary cancer received at least 30 min of psycho-oncological consultation in 2009.  Results:   Data from n = 456 certified cancer centres were available. In the centres, a total of 36,165 patients were seen by a psycho-oncologist for at least 30 min, representing 37.3% of all patients in the centres. The highest percentage of patients who received psycho-oncological care was found in breast cancer centres (66.7%), and the lowest in prostate cancer centres (6.8%). Half of the patients (50.0%) in gynaecological cancer centres, 37.7% in colon cancer centres and 25.4% in lung cancer centres received psycho-oncological care.  Conclusions:   Compared with non-certified centres, the proportion of patients receiving psycho-oncological care in certified cancer centres has increased.""","""['Susanne Singer', 'Sebastian Dieng', 'Simone Wesselmann']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Psychooncology""","""['Certification of breast centres in Germany: proof of concept for a prototypical example of quality assurance in multidisciplinary cancer care.', 'Better patient orientation through certified cancer centres in oncological care?

We hypothesized that CSA is also associated with factors affecting quality of life. Herein, we examine the association of CSA with psychosocial factors and PCa aggressiveness in a cohort of men 1 year after prostatectomy for localized PCa.  Methods:   From our prospective PCa Registry, we identified 365 men who underwent prostatectomy for localized PCa who completed the Memorial Anxiety Scale for Prostate Cancer (MAX-PC) and Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite at 1-year follow-up. We evaluated the association of scores on the MAX-PC with demographics, clinicopathologic features, sexual function, and depression scores using Wilcoxon Rank Sum and Kendall's tau correlation tests.  Results:   Higher scores on the MAX-PC (i.e., higher anxiety) are associated with younger age (p < 0.01) and non-Caucasian race (p < 0.01). Men with higher MAX-PC scores also reported poor sexual satisfaction/function (p < 0.01) and increasing depressive symptoms (p < 0.01). Finally, although higher anxiety is associated with several pathologic features of aggressiveness (stage, positive margins, PSA at 1 year; all p-values < 0.01), we noted several men with clinically indolent disease who reported significant anxiety.  Conclusions:   Our data suggest that higher levels of CSA are associated with poor sexual function and increased depressive symptoms 1 year after prostatectomy. Moreover, we noted demographic and pathologic features associated with higher CSA as well. If confirmed, our data support development of models to predict men at high risk of CSA following PCa surgery and targeted referral for additional counseling.""","""['Andrea M Tavlarides', 'Steven C Ames', 'Nancy N Diehl', 'Richard W Joseph', 'Erik P Castle', 'David D Thiel', 'Gregory A Broderick', 'Alexander S Parker']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Psychooncology""","""['Baseline and follow-up association of the MAX-PC in Men with newly diagnosed prostate cancer.', 'A longitudinal study of anxiety, depression and distress as predictors of sexual and urinary quality of life in men with prostate cancer.', 'Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite versus Incontinence Symptom Index and Sexual Health Inventory for Men to measure functional outcomes after prostatectomy.', 'Psychological impact of different primary treatments for prostate cancer: A critical analysis.', 'Coping with losses, grief, and mourning in prostate cancer.', 'Factors that influence treatment decisions: A qualitative study of racially and ethnically diverse patients with low- and very-low risk prostate cancer.', 'Prostate cancer-related anxiety among long-term survivors after radical prostatectomy: A longitudinal study.', 'Systematic Review of Focal and Salvage Cryotherapy for Prostate Cancer.', 'Fear of cancer recurrence and PSA anxiety in patients with prostate cancer: a systematic review.', 'Changes in Beck Depression Inventory scores in prostate cancer patients undergoing androgen deprivation therapy or prostatectomy.']"""

The study objectives were to investigate practice patterns in the management of PC and to determine the adherence to the 2007 Spanish guidelines for the management of PC.  Materials and methods:   An epidemiological, cross-sectional study was undertaken. Study-specific questionnaires were distributed to all centers with radiation oncology (RO) facilities delivering megavoltage radiation therapy (RT) in Spain (n = 108). A questionnaire evaluated diagnostic and treatment approaches to PC in low-risk and high-risk cases. And a 12-item questionnaire was used to assess guidelines adherence.  Results:   Responses were obtained from 102 centers (94.0 % response rate). In the high-risk scenario, the majority of clinicians (99.0 %) chose combined modality treatment with RT and androgen deprivation (AD) and 93.0 % recommended long-term AD. External-beam RT (EBRT) doses ranging 72-76 Gy were used in 59.5 % of centers and >76 Gy was employed in 40.5 %. In the low-risk scenario, EBRT was chosen by 59.6 %, brachytherapy by 39.4 %, and active surveillance by 1 %. The consensus was high (score 5 + 4 ≥ 90 %) on 8/12 questions assessing adherence to guidelines, being high specifically on items related to RT technique, RT dose, combination of HT and RT in intermediate/high-risk patients, and prognostic factors.  Conclusions:   This is the largest survey to date of Spanish RO departments dealing with PC. The study results therefore likely provide a highly reliable picture of clinical practice in Spain in this century and show how this practice is influenced by clinical evidence from randomized trials and consensus conferences.""","""['Almudena Zapatero', 'José López-Torrecilla', 'Ismael Herruzo', 'Felipe A Calvo;SEOR URONCOR GICOR participating Investigators']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Clin Transl Oncol""","""['Consensus and differences in primary radiotherapy for localized and locally advanced prostate cancer in Switzerland: A survey on patterns of practice.', 'Management of prostate cancer patients following radiation therapy after radical surgery referred from urology to radiation oncology departments in Spain.', 'Dramatically Polarized Opinion on the Role of Brachytherapy Boost in Management of High-risk Prostate Cancer: A Survey of North American Genitourinary Expert Radiation Oncologists.', 'The role of androgen ablation in patients with biochemical or local failure after definitive radiation therapy: a survey of practice patterns of urologists and radiation oncologists in the United States.', 'Patterns of practice of androgen deprivation therapy combined to radiotherapy in favorable and unfavorable intermediate risk prostate cancer.

Hypofractionated regimens included: 68.04 Gy at 2.52 Gy/fraction, 70 Gy at 2.5 Gy/fraction, and 70.2 Gy at 2.6 Gy/fraction. Genitourinary (GU) and gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity was scored using the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group scoring system.  Results:   Thirty-two patients were treated with 68.04 Gy, 5 patients with 70 Gy, and 11 with 70.2 Gy. The median age at diagnosis was 69 years (range 49-87) and the median follow-up 11 months (range 7-40). Grade 2 acute GI toxicity occurred in 9 patients (19 %). No grade 3 or higher acute GI toxicity was observed. Grade 2 and 3 acute GU toxicities occurred in 19 and 6 % of patients, respectively. The incidence of late grade 2 GI and GU toxicity was 4 and 2 %, respectively. No grade 3 or higher late toxicities were observed. Multivariate analysis showed that patients treated at 2.6 Gy/fraction or those who received a total radiation dose ≥70 Gy had higher rates of grade ≥2 acute GU toxicity (P = 0.004 and P = 0.048, respectively).

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the potency of specific short-interfering RNA (siRNA) to suppress human VEGF expression by siRNA and investigate the effects of VEGF down-regulation on the cell proliferation and apoptosis of the human prostate cancer cell lines DU-145.  Methods:   Transfection was performed using X-tremeGENE siRNA transfection reagent. At different time intervals, transfected cells were harvested and total RNA was extracted for RT-PCR. The VEGF content in supernatants were measured by ELISA. Inhibition of cell growth by hVEGF-siRNA was measured by using cell proliferation ELISA BrdU assay. Apoptotic cells were evaluated by using annexin-V-FITC apoptotic detection method.  Results:   Transfection of hVEGF-siRNA resulted in statistically significant inhibition of hVEGF-mRNA that in turn caused a marked reduction in the expression of hVEGF. The cell growth was assessed every 24 h for 4 days after siRNA treatment resulted in a marked inhibition of cell proliferation as compared to scramble siRNA. The results of apoptosis showed that approximately 15 % of the cells treated with control-siRNA manifested evident apoptotic changes after 24 hpt, whereas DU-145 cells treated with hVEGF-siRNA significantly were positive, that is to say, 53 % at 72 hpt 23.9 ± 2.78 % (P < 0.001) and 13 ± 1.57 % at 96 hpt.  Conclusion:   Our findings indicate that siRNA are effective in eliciting the RNAi pathway in cancerous cells and that specific siRNA efficiently down-regulate VEGF expression. They could decrease VEGF production and induce apoptosis, which may also be linked to the inhibition of cancerous cell proliferation. Therefore, it can be concluded that siRNA-mediated suppression of VEGF represents a powerful tool against prostate cancer cell proliferation. VEGF down-regulation exerts a direct anti-apoptotic function in the DU-145 cell lines and promises the development of drugs for cancer therapy.""","""['A Deezagi', 'S Ansari-Majd', 'N Vaseli-Hagh']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Clin Transl Oncol""","""['Inhibiting the growth of malignant melanoma by blocking the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor using an RNA interference approach.', 'Inhibition of JNK-1 by small interfering RNA induces apoptotic signaling in PC-3 prostate cancer cells.', 'Proliferation suppression and apoptosis of ovarian carcinoma cells induced by small interfering RNA against vascular endothelial growth factor.', 'Inhibition of bladder cancer cell growth and angiogenesis by co-blockage of vascular endothelial growth factor and its receptor KDR.', 'hVEGF siRNA inhibits initial growth of A549 tumor cells in nude mice and angiogenesis on CAM assay.', 'Progress in Delivery of siRNA-Based Therapeutics Employing Nano-Vehicles for Treatment of Prostate Cancer.', 'Prostaglandin F-2α Stimulates The Secretion of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor and Induces Cell Proliferation and Migration of Adipose Tissue Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells.', 'Antiproliferative effect of a synthetic aptamer mimicking androgen response elements in the LNCaP cell line.', 'A prostate-specific antigen-dependent fusion polypeptide inhibits growth of prostate cancer cells in vitro and in vivo.', 'A small interfering RNA targeting vascular endothelial growth factor efficiently inhibits growth of VX2 cells and VX2 tumor model of hepatocellular carcinoma in rabbit by transarterial embolization-mediated siRNA delivery.']"""

Although it is very toxic, cisplatin is still one of the most applied chemotherapeutics used for treatment of sarcomas, carcinomas, etc. It causes severe side effects as a result of the lack of selectivity of the drug to tumor tissue and acquired or intrinsic resistance occurs. Wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) is a lectin that specifically recognizes transformed cells: prostate cancer cells, pancreatic cells etc., and is uptaken into the tumor cells for which it appears to be a suitable target for anticancer agents. A fluorescence spectroscopy method was used to study the interaction of WGA with four metal-based anticancer drugs: cisplatin, Pt porphyrin and two gold porphyrins. The affinity constant (k(D)) for binding of cisplatin with WGA was k(D) = 6.67 ± 2.5 μM. The hyperbolic curve indicated the presence of a single cisplatin binding site. The affinity of Au and Pt porphyrin to WGA (k(D) = 0.08-0.49 μM) is almost two orders of magnitude higher than that for cisplatin. We found that Pt porphyrin could displace fluorescent dye ANS showing an increase in the fluorescence intensity with a concomitant blue shift of the emission maximum suggesting that the compounds accommodate the same binding site. Current research characterizes the metalloanticancer binding capacity of WGA. Our results indicate that four metal-based anticancer agents have high affinity for WGA. Since WGA recognizes transformed cells, the obtained data show that this protein might have putative usage as a drug delivery molecule in cancer.""","""['Vanya P Bogoeva', 'Lidiya P Petrova', 'Ivan B Ivanov', 'Hristina N Kulina', 'Ivan Ch Buchvarov']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Mol Biosyst""","""['Wheatgerm agglutinin-mediated toxicity in pancreatic cancer cells.', 'Tumor-specific protein human galectin-1 interacts with anticancer agents.', 'Dual-targeting topotecan liposomes modified with tamoxifen and wheat germ agglutinin significantly improve drug transport across the blood-brain barrier and survival of brain tumor-bearing animals.', 'Characterization of the wheat germ agglutinin binding to self-assembled monolayers of neoglycoconjugates by AFM and SPR.', 'Fluorescence analysis of hormone binding activities of wheat germ agglutinin.', 'New Activity of a Protein from Canavalia ensiformis.']"""

The miRNA expression signature in clinical specimens of PCa showed that 56 miRNAs were significantly downregulated in PCa compared with non-PCa tissues. We focused on the top four downregulated miRNAs (miR-187, miR-205, miR-222 and miR-31) to investigate their functional significance in PCa cells. Expression levels of these four miRNAs were validated in PCa specimens (15 PCa tissues and 17 non-PCa tissues) to confirm that they were significantly reduced in these PCa tissues. Gain-of-function analysis demonstrated that miR-222 and miR-31 inhibited cell proliferation, invasion and migration in PCa cell lines (PC3 and DU145), suggesting that miR-222 and miR-31 may act as tumor suppressors in PCa. Genome-wide gene expression analysis using miR-222 or miR-31 transfectants to identify the pathways they affect showed that many cancer-related genes are regulated by these miRNAs in PC3 cells.

Objective:   To develop and validate internally the first IBX-specific PCA3-based nomogram that allows an individual assessment of a man's risk of harboring any PCa and high-grade PCa (HGPCa).  Design, setting, and participants:   Clinical and biopsy data including urinary PCA3 score of 692 referred IBX men at risk of PCa were collected within two prospective multi-institutional studies.  Intervention:   IBX (≥ 10 biopsy cores) with standard risk factor assessment including prebiopsy urinary PCA3 measurement.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   PCA3 assay cut-off thresholds were investigated. Regression coefficients of logistic risk factor analyses were used to construct specific sets of PCA3-based nomograms to predict any PCa and HGPCa at IBX. Accuracy estimates for the presence of any PCa and HGPCa were quantified using area under the curve of the receiver operator characteristic analysis and compared with a clinical model. Bootstrap resamples were used for internal validation. Decision curve analyses quantified the clinical net benefit related to the novel PCA3-based IBX nomogram versus the clinical model.  Results and limitations:   Any PCa and HGPCa were diagnosed in 46% (n=318) and 20% (n=137), respectively. Age, prostate-specific antigen, digital rectal examination, prostate volume, and PCA3 were independent predictors of PCa at IBX (all p<0.001). The PCA3-based IBX nomograms significantly outperformed the clinical models without PCA3 (all p<0.001). Accuracy was increased by 4.5-7.1% related to PCA3 inclusion. When applying nomogram-derived PCa probability thresholds ≤ 30%, only a few patients with HGPCa (≤ 2%) will be missed while avoiding up to 55% of unnecessary biopsies. External validation of the PCA3-based IBX-specific nomogram is warranted.  Conclusions:   The internally validated PCA3-based IBX-specific nomogram outperforms a clinical prediction model without PCA3 for the prediction of any PCa, leading to the avoidance of unnecessary biopsies while missing only a few cases of HGPCa.

In this situation the physician performing the transperineal implant is required to be close to the fluoroscopy unit and dose to the eye lens may be of concern. In 1991 the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) provided a recommended dose limit of 150 mSv yr(-1) for occupational exposures to the lens of the eye. With more long term follow-up data, this limit was revised in 2011 to 20 mSv yr(-1). With this revised limit in mind, we have investigated the dose to the lens of the eye received by physicians during prostate brachytherapy seed implantation. By making an approximation of annual workload, we have related the dose received to the annual background dose.

Thirty-six men with recurring prostate cancer were randomized to the intervention or wait-list control. Assessments were at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months. Of 17 men randomized to the intervention, 14 completed the requirements. Nineteen were randomized to control and 17 completed requirements. Compared with controls, a significant postintervention (3 months) decrease in A:V in the intervention group (P=0.01) was self-maintained 3 months postintervention (P=0.049). At each assessment, A:V was correlated with lycopene, fiber, saturated fat, and dietary cholesterol, four dietary components linked to clinically relevant outcomes in prostate cancer.

Materials and methods:   We treated a total of 130 patients for intermediate and high risk prostate cancer at our institution between 2000 and 2007 using PDR-brachytherapy as a boost after conformal external beam radiation therapy to 50.4 Gy. The majority of patients had T2 disease (T1c 6%, T2 75%, T3 19%). Seventy three patients had intermediate-risk and 53 patients had high-risk disease according to the D'Amico classification. The dose of the brachytherapy boost was escalated from 25 to 35 Gy - 33 pts. received 25 Gy (total dose 75 Gy), 63 pts. 30 Gy (total dose 80 Gy) and 34 pts. 35 Gy, (total dose 85 Gy) given in one session (dose per pulse was 0.60 Gy or 0.70 Gy/h, 24h per day, night and day, with a time interval of 1h between two pulses). PSA-recurrence-free survival according to Kaplan-Meier using the Phoenix definition of biochemical failure was calculated and also late toxicities according to Common Toxicity Criteria scale were assessed.  Results:   At the time of analysis with a median follow-up of 60 months biochemical control was achieved by 88% of patients - only 16/130 patients (12.3%) developed a biochemical relapse. Biochemical relapse free survival calculated according to Kaplan-Meier for all patients at 5 years was 85.6% (83.9% for intermediate-risk patients and 84.2% for high-risk patients) and at 9 years' follow up it was 79.0%. Analysing biochemical relapse free survival separately for different boost dose levels, at 5 years it was 97% for the 35 Gy boost dose and 82% for the 25 and 30 Gy dose levels. The side effects of therapy were negligible: There were 18 cases (15%) of grade 1/2 rectal proctitis, one case (0.8%) of grade 3 proctitis, 18 cases (15%) of grade 1/2 cystitis, and no cases (0%) with dysuria grade 3. No patient had a bulbourethral stricture requiring dilation or new onset incontinence.  Conclusions:   Image-guided conformal PDR-brachytherapy using up to 35 Gy as boost dose after 50 Gy of external beam radiation therapy (total dose up to 85 Gy) is a very effective treatment option with very low morbidity in patients with intermediate or high risk prostate cancer.

Methods:   A total of 104 prostate cancer patients were enrolled in this study. Their urinary morbidity was followed up using the International Prostate Symptom Score and Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite for 12 months or more after permanent prostate brachytherapy. Patients were classified into two groups based on their baseline International Prostate Symptom Score: the low International Prostate Symptom Score group (score ≤ 7) and the high International Prostate Symptom Score group (score ≥ 8). Urinary morbidity was estimated in each group based on the results of the International Prostate Symptom Score and Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite measured before permanent prostate brachytherapy, and at 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after the end of all radiation therapy.  Results:   The overall mean total International Prostate Symptom Score, International Prostate Symptom Score quality of life score, and urinary-related scores for Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite were significantly worse at 1 month after the end of treatment, but they improved gradually after the treatment and recovered to the baseline level within 12 months. Even in the high-International Prostate Symptom Score group, the International Prostate Symptom Score and International Prostate Symptom Score Quality of Life score were significantly worse at 1-3 months after permanent prostate brachytherapy, and then recovered to the baseline level without prolongation. Although the urination-related Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite score in the high-International Prostate Symptom Score group was significantly worse at 1 month after permanent prostate brachytherapy in comparison with that in the low-International Prostate Symptom Score group, it recovered to the baseline level without prolongation.

If filling status of rectum and bladder is constant, motion should be reduced. We attempted to reduce interfraction motion errors by proper patient instruction.  Method:   In 38 patients pairs of radio-opaque fiducial markers were implanted prior to definitive radiotherapy. Patients were positioned either according to skin marks or infrared body marker. We measured prostate displacement, i.e. pelvic bones versus intraprostatic marker position, via ExacTrac (two orthogonal radiographies) in 1252 fractions. Systematic and random setup and displacement errors were determined and safety margins estimated.  Results:   In our study interfraction prostate displacement is < 1 mm in RL direction, and < 2 mm in AP and SI direction. Systematic errors are slightly below random errors (< 1.5 mm). Positioning according skin marks results in higher inaccuracies of ±1.5 - 2 mm in RL and ±2 - 2.5 mm in AP/SI direction.  Conclusions:   In case of appropriate patient instructions (constant organ filling) the positioning via bone fusion requires CTV-PTV margins of 2 mm in RL, 4 mm in AP, and 5 mm in SI direction.

Yet, limited data exist to show that such clinics affect management. The purpose of this study was to determine whether consultation at a multidisciplinary clinic is associated with selection of active surveillance in patients with low-risk prostate cancer.  Patients and methods:   The study comprised 701 men with low-risk prostate cancer managed at three tertiary care centers in Boston, MA in 2009. Patients either obtained consultation at a multidisciplinary prostate cancer clinic, at which they were seen by a combination of urologic, radiation, and medical oncologists in a concurrent setting, or they were seen by individual practitioners in sequential settings. The primary outcome was selection of active surveillance.  Results:   Crude rates of selection of active surveillance in patients seen at a multidisciplinary clinic were double that of patients seen by individual practitioners (43% v 22%), whereas the proportion of men treated with prostatectomy or radiation decreased by approximately 30% (P < .001).

Methods:   This case-control study is nested within the Multiethnic Cohort of African Americans, Native Hawaiians, Japanese Americans, Latinos, and whites in Hawaii and California. The analysis included 392 prostate cancer cases and 783 controls matched on age, race/ethnicity, date/time of blood draw and fasting status. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI).  Results:   The mean serum zinc concentrations did not significantly differ between cases (94.9 µg/dl) and controls (93.9 µg/dl).

Conclusions:   We found no evidence to support an inverse relationship between serum zinc and prostate cancer risk, and, to the contrary, found a suggestion in the ethnic-specific results of a possible increase in risk; however, blood concentrations of zinc may not adequately reflect the levels in prostate tissue.

The proportion of these patients imaged and rate of imaging per-patient per-month of survival were calculated for each phase of care in patients diagnosed between January 2002 and December 2006 (N = 55,253 patients). Logistic regression was used to estimate trends in imaging use in stage IV patients diagnosed between January 1995 and December 2006, which were compared with trends in imaging use in early-stage (stages I and II) patients with the same tumor types during the same period (N = 192,429 patients).

Methods:   We used a range of analytical techniques including in situ polymerase chain reaction (IS-PCR) and standard liquid PCR followed by sequencing of the product to seek to identify HPV and EBV in normal, benign, and malignant prostate tissues.  Results:   Both HPV type 18 and EBV gene sequences were identified in a high and approximately equal proportion of normal, benign, and prostate cancer specimens. These sequences were located in the nuclei of prostate epithelial cells. HPV associated koilocytes were identified in 24% of prostate cancer specimens.  Conclusions:   The presence of both HPV and EBV gene sequences in most of the same normal, benign, and malignant prostate specimens is particularly noteworthy because of recent experimental evidence demonstrating that EBV and HPV can collaborate to increase proliferation of cultured cervical cells.

Here it functions as a pro-proliferative and anti-apoptotic signaling receptor via NH(2)-terminal domain ligation. Auto-antibodies to this domain may appear in cancer patient serum where they are a poor prognostic indicator. Conversely, GRP78 COOH-terminal domain ligation is pro-apoptotic and anti-proliferative. There is no method to disrupt cell-surface GRP78 without compromising the total GRP78 pool, making it difficult to study cell-surface GRP78 function. We studied six cell lines representing three cancer types. One cell line per group expresses high levels of cell-surface GRP78, and the other expresses low levels (human hepatoma: Hep3B and HepG2; human prostate cancer: PC3 and 1-LN; murine melanoma: B16F0 and B16F1). We investigated the effect of Escherichia coli subtilase cytoxin catalytic subunit (SubA) on GRP78. We report that SubA specifically cleaves cell-surface GRP78 on HepG2, 1-LN, and B16F1 cells without affecting intracellular GRP78. B16F0 cells (GRP78(low)) have lower amounts of cleaved cell-surface GRP78. SubA has no effect on Hep3B and PC3 cells. The predicted 28-kDa GRP78 COOH-terminal fragment is released into the culture medium by SubA treatment, and COOH-terminal domain signal transduction is abrogated, whereas pro-proliferative signaling mediated through NH(2)-terminal domain ligation is unaffected. These experiments clarify cell-surface GRP78 topology and demonstrate that the COOH-terminal domain is necessary for pro-apoptotic signal transduction occurring upon COOH-terminal antibody ligation.

Epigenetic changes control chromosomal integrity, gene functions and ultimately carcinogenesis. The enzyme glycine-N-methyltransferase (GNMT) contributes to S-adenosylmethionine level regulation and, by affecting DNA methylation, influences gene expression. The genotype and allele distribution of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the promoter regions of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), interleukin (IL)-10, IL-1β, alpha-1-antichymotrypsin (ACT) and GNMT genes, the level of global DNA methylation and the influence of GNMT SNP upon DNA methylation in a PCa case-control study have been investigated.  Methods:   SNPs of VEGF (rs699947), ACT (rs1884082), IL-1β (rs16944), IL-10 (rs1800896) and GNMT (rs9462856) genes were assessed by PCR or by real-time PCR methods. DNA methylation was assessed by an ELISA assay.  Results:   Frequencies of the VEGF AA genotype, the IL-10 A allele and GNMT T allele were higher in PCa. The concomitant presence of the AA genotype of VEGF, the A allele of IL-10 and T allele of GNMT increased the risk of PCa. Total DNA methylation was decreased in PCa; control GNMT T carriers (T+) showed the highest level of DNA methylation.  Conclusions:   SNPs in VEGF, IL-10 and GNMT genes might have a synergistic role in the development of PCa. The GNMT T allele may influence PCa risk by affecting DNA methylation and prostate gene expression.

Results:   PSA concentration significantly decreased with increasing body mass index (BMI; β = -0.011, P < 0.001); however, PSA mass estimated by HCT- (β = 0.004, P = 0.132) and BSA (β = -0.003, P = 0.094)-based equations remained consistent.

Moreover, the mean (95% confidence interval) difference of PV between the two equations was 0.33 (-0.06 to 0.73) L.  Conclusions:   The inverse relationship between PSA concentration and BMI might be explained by a hemodilution effect among obese men.

Here we show that the reciprocal interplay between CAFs and prostate cancer cells goes beyond the engagement of EMT to include mutual metabolic reprogramming. Gene expression analysis of CAFs cultured ex vivo or human prostate fibroblasts obtained from benign prostate hyperplasia revealed that CAFs undergo Warburg metabolism and mitochondrial oxidative stress. This metabolic reprogramming toward a Warburg phenotype occurred as a result of contact with prostate cancer cells. Intercellular contact activated the stromal fibroblasts, triggering increased expression of glucose transporter GLUT1, lactate production, and extrusion of lactate by de novo expressed monocarboxylate transporter-4 (MCT4). Conversely, prostate cancer cells, upon contact with CAFs, were reprogrammed toward aerobic metabolism, with a decrease in GLUT1 expression and an increase in lactate upload via the lactate transporter MCT1. Metabolic reprogramming of both stromal and cancer cells was under strict control of the hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF1), which drove redox- and SIRT3-dependent stabilization of HIF1 in normoxic conditions. Prostate cancer cells gradually became independent of glucose consumption, while developing a dependence on lactate upload to drive anabolic pathways and thereby cell growth. In agreement, pharmacologic inhibition of MCT1-mediated lactate upload dramatically affected prostate cancer cell survival and tumor outgrowth. Hence, cancer cells allocate Warburg metabolism to their corrupted CAFs, exploiting their byproducts to grow in a low glucose environment, symbiotically adapting with stromal cells to glucose availability.""","""['Tania Fiaschi', 'Alberto Marini', 'Elisa Giannoni', 'Maria Letizia Taddei', 'Paolo Gandellini', 'Alina De Donatis', 'Michele Lanciotti', 'Sergio Serni', 'Paolo Cirri', 'Paola Chiarugi']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Cancer Res""","""['Tumor-stroma metabolic relationship based on lactate shuttle can sustain prostate cancer progression.', 'Androgens enhance the glycolytic metabolism and lactate export in prostate cancer cells by modulating the expression of GLUT1, GLUT3, PFK, LDH and MCT4 genes.', 'Nuclear factor E2-related factor-2 has a differential impact on MCT1 and MCT4 lactate carrier expression in colonic epithelial cells: a condition favoring metabolic symbiosis between colorectal cancer and stromal cells.', 'Metabolic coupling and the Reverse Warburg Effect in cancer: Implications for novel biomarker and anticancer agent development.', 'Tumor microenvironment and metabolic synergy in breast cancers: critical importance of mitochondrial fuels and function.', 'Breast cancers as ecosystems: a metabolic perspective.', 'Association between pH regulation of the tumor microenvironment and immunological state.', 'Lactate as Key Metabolite in Prostate Cancer Progression: What Are the Clinical Implications?', 'Tumor metabolism rewiring in epithelial ovarian cancer.', 'The epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity landscape: principles of design and mechanisms of regulation.']"""

In prostatectomy specimens, ERG rearrangements are greater than 99% specific for prostate cancer or high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia adjacent to ERG-rearranged prostate cancer by fluorescence in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry.  Objective:   To evaluate ERG staining by immunohistochemistry on needle biopsies, including diagnostically challenging cases.  Design:   Biopsies from a retrospective cohort (n = 111) enriched in cores requiring diagnostic immunohistochemistry and a prospective cohort from all cases during 3 months (n = 311) were stained with an anti-ERG antibody (clone EPR3864).  Results:   Among evaluable cores (n = 418), ERG staining was confined to cancerous epithelium (71 of 160 cores; 44%), high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (12 of 68 cores; 18%), and atypical foci (3 of 28 cores; 11%), with staining in only 2 of 162 cores (1%) diagnosed as benign. The ERG was expressed in about 5 morphologically benign glands across 418 cores and was uniformly expressed by all cancerous glands in 70 of 71 cores (99%).  Conclusions:   ERG staining is more prostate cancer-specific than α-methylacyl-coenzyme A racemase, and staining in an atypical focus supports a diagnosis of cancer if high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia can be excluded. Thus, ERG staining shows utility in diagnostically challenging biopsies and may be useful in molecularly subtyping prostate cancer and in stratifying isolated high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia by risk of subsequent cancer.""","""['Scott A Tomlins', 'Nallasivam Palanisamy', 'Javed Siddiqui', 'Arul M Chinnaiyan', 'Lakshmi P Kunju']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Arch Pathol Lab Med""","""['The utility of ERG/P63 double immunohistochemical staining in the diagnosis of limited cancer in prostate needle biopsies.', 'Antibody-based detection of ERG rearrangement-positive prostate cancer.', 'The diagnostic utility of novel immunohistochemical marker ERG in the workup of prostate biopsies with ""atypical glands suspicious for cancer"".', 'Clinical applications of novel ERG immunohistochemistry in prostate cancer diagnosis and management.', 'The prognostic and predictive value of TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion and ERG protein expression in prostate cancer biopsies.', 'PCA3 and TMPRSS2: ERG Urine Level as Diagnostic Biomarker of Prostate Cancer.', 'Human ERG oncoprotein represses a Drosophila LIM domain binding protein-coding gene Chip.', 'Cellular and Molecular Progression of Prostate Cancer: Models for Basic and Preclinical Research.', 'Serial Molecular Profiling of Low-grade Prostate Cancer to Assess Tumor Upgrading: A Longitudinal Cohort Study.', 'Molecular characterization of prostate cancer in Middle Eastern population highlights differences with Western populations with prognostic implication.']"""

While chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with massively parallel sequencing (ChIP-Seq) is becoming an essential tool for studying transcription and chromatin modification factors, it has rarely been employed in the context of drug discovery.  Results:   Here we report changes in the genome-wide AR binding landscape due to dose-dependent inhibition by drug-like small molecules using ChIP-Seq. Integration of sequence analysis, transcriptome profiling, cell viability assays and xenograft tumor growth inhibition studies enabled us to establish a direct cistrome-activity relationship for two novel potent AR antagonists. By selectively occupying the strongest binding sites, AR signaling remains active even when androgen levels are low, as is characteristic of first-line androgen ablation therapy. Coupled cistrome and transcriptome profiling upon small molecule antagonism led to the identification of a core set of AR direct effector genes that are most likely to mediate the activities of targeted agents: unbiased pathway mapping revealed that AR is a key modulator of steroid metabolism by forming a tightly controlled feedback loop with other nuclear receptor family members and this oncogenic effect can be relieved by antagonist treatment. Furthermore, we found that AR also has an extensive role in negative gene regulation, with estrogen (related) receptor likely mediating its function as a transcriptional repressor.  Conclusions:   Our study provides a global and dynamic view of AR's regulatory program upon antagonism, which may serve as a molecular basis for deciphering and developing AR therapeutics.""","""['Zhou Zhu', 'Manli Shi', 'Wenyue Hu', 'Heather Estrella', 'Jon Engebretsen', 'Tim Nichols', 'David Briere', 'Natilie Hosea', 'Gerrit Los', 'Paul A Rejto', 'Andrea Fanjul']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""BMC Genomics""","""['The transcriptional programme of the androgen receptor (AR) in prostate cancer.', 'A competitive inhibitor that reduces recruitment of androgen receptor to androgen-responsive genes.', 'Discovery of N-(4-(Benzyloxy)-phenyl)-sulfonamide Derivatives as Novel Antagonists of the Human Androgen Receptor Targeting the Activation Function 2.', 'Strategy for Tumor-Selective Disruption of Androgen Receptor Function in the Spectrum of Prostate Cancer.', 'Androgen receptor enhancer usage and the chromatin regulatory landscape in human prostate cancers.', 'Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma controls prostate cancer cell growth through AR-dependent and independent mechanisms.', 'Decoding the Inversion Symmetry Underlying Transcription Factor DNA-Binding Specificity and Functionality in the Genome.', 'Identification of Androgen Receptor Modulators in a Prostate Cancer Cell Line Microarray Compendium.', 'Transcriptional Regulation in Prostate Cancer.', 'DNA Sequence Constraints Define Functionally Active Steroid Nuclear Receptor Binding Sites in Chromatin.']"""

Recently, this cell line was shown to harbor multiple copies of a gammaretrovirus, called XMRV, integrated in its genome. While the original prostate cancer xenograft CWR22 is free of any retrovirus, subsequently generated cell lines 22Rv1 and CWR-R1, carry this virus and additionally shed infectious gammaretroviral particles in their supernatant. Although XMRV most likely was generated by recombination events in cell culture this virus has been demonstrated to infect human cells in vitro and 22Rv1 as well as CWR-R1 cells are now considered biosafety 2 reagents. Here, we demonstrate that 22Rv1 cells with reduced retroviral transcription show reduced tumor angiogenesis and increased necrosis of the primary tumor derived from xenografted cells in scid mice when compared to the parental cell line. The presence of XMRV transcripts significantly increases secretion of osteopontin (OPN), CXCL14, IL13 and TIMP2 in 22Rv1 cells. Furthermore, these data are supported by in vitro cell invasion and differentiation assays. Collectively, our data suggest that the presence of XMRV transcripts at least partially contributes to 22Rv1 characteristics observed in vitro and in vivo with regard to migration, invasion and tumor angiogenesis.

The expected number was computed by multiplying each age-race-specific average annual incidence rate from the pre-PSA era (1983-1985) by the number of men in the corresponding age-race category in the year 2008 and adding the products.  Results:   In the year 2008, the observed and expected numbers of men presenting with M1 PC in the SEER 9 registries area were 739 and 2277, respectively, with an expected-to-observed ratio of 3.1 (95% confidence interval, 3.0-3.2).

There are concerns that PSA may be less accurate in detecting prostate cancer in men with increased body mass index (BMI). We determine whether the diagnostic potential of PSA is negatively influenced by obesity by comparing its operating characteristics across BMI categories among men undergoing prostate biopsy.  Methods:   Demographic, clinical, and histopathological data on 917 men who underwent trans-rectal ultrasound-guided prostate needle biopsy from 2002 to 2010 at a University hospital in Italy were used in the study. Men were categorized for BMI as follows: <25 kg/m(2) (normal weight), 25-29.9 kg/m(2) (overweight), and ≥ 30 kg/m(2) (obese). Receiver operator characteristics (ROC) curves were used to assess PSA accuracy for predicting prostate cancer overall and then stratified according to digital rectal examination (DRE) findings using the area under the ROC curve (AUC).  Results:   The obesity rate of the study cohort was 21 %. There was no statistically significant difference in the overall AUCs of PSA for predicting CaP among normal-weight (AUC = 0.56), overweight (AUC = 0.60), and obese men (AUC = 0.60; p = 0.68) in either DRE-positive or negative men.

Second, in the statistical methodology, we used a distance indicator instead of the standard aggregating method principal component analysis. Third, we propose another methodological improvement, which consists in the use of a more robust statistical method to assess the relationship between deprivation and health responses in ecological regressions.  Methods:   We conducted an ecological small-area analysis based on the residents of the Metropolitan region of Barcelona in the period 1994-2007. Standardized mortality rates, stratified by sex, were studied for four mortality causes: tumor of the bronquial, lung and trachea, diabetes mellitus type II, breast cancer, and prostate cancer. Socioeconomic conditions were summarized using a deprivation index. Sixteen socio-demographic variables available in the Spanish Census of Population and Housing were included. The deprivation index was constructed by aggregating the above-mentioned variables using the distance indicator, DP2. For the estimation of the ecological regression we used hierarchical Bayesian models with some improvements.  Results:   At greater deprivation, there is an increased risk of dying from diabetes for both sexes and of dying from lung cancer for men. On the other hand, at greater deprivation, there is a decreased risk of dying from breast cancer and lung cancer for women. We did not find a clear relationship in the case of prostate cancer (presenting an increased risk but only in the second quintile of deprivation).  Conclusions:   We believe our results were obtained using a more robust methodology. First off, we have built a better index that allows us to directly collect the variability of contextual variables without having to use arbitrary weights.

The aggressiveness of breast cancers in women has been positively correlated with the expression of the RyR in breast tumor tissue, but it is unknown if this is limited to specific isoforms. Identification and characterization of RyRs in cancer models is important in understanding the role of the RyR channel complex in cancer and as a potential therapeutic target. The objective of this report was to identify the RyR isoforms expressed in widely used prostate cancer cell lines, DU-145 and LNCaP, and the non-tumorigenic prostate cell line, PWR-1E. Oligonucleotide primers specific for each isoform were used in semi-quantitative and real-time PCR to determine the identification and expression levels of the RyR isoforms. RyR1 was expressed in the highest amount in DU-145 tumor cells, expression was 0.48-fold in the non-tumor cell line PWR-1E compared to DU-145 cells, and no expression was observed in LNCaP tumor cells. DU-145 cells had the lowest expression of RyR2. The expression was 26- and 15-fold higher in LNCaP and PWR-1E cells, respectively. RyR3 expression was not observed in any of the cell lines. All cell types released Ca(2+) in response to caffeine showing they had functional RyRs. Total cellular RyR-associated Ca(2+) release is determined by both the number of activated RyRs and its accessory proteins which modulate the receptor. Our results suggest that the correlation between the expression of the RyR and tumor aggression is not related to specific RyR isoforms, but may be related to the activity and number of receptors.""","""['Sarah E Kobylewski', 'Kimberly A Henderson', 'Curtis D Eckhert']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Biochem Biophys Res Commun""","""['Two ryanodine receptor isoforms in nonmammalian vertebrate skeletal muscle: possible roles in excitation-contraction coupling and other processes.', 'Expression and role of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor and ryanodine receptor in a human lens epithelial cell line.', 'Functional ryanodine receptors are expressed by human microglia and THP-1 cells: Their possible involvement in modulation of neurotoxicity.', 'Type 1 and type 3 ryanodine receptors generate different Ca(2+) release event activity in both intact and permeabilized myotubes.', 'Structure and pharmacology of ryanodine receptors.', 'Structural Insight Into Ryanodine Receptor Channelopathies.', 'Genome-wide association analysis reveals regulation of at-risk loci by DNA methylation in prostate cancer.', 'Interception Targets of Angelica Gigas Nakai Root Extract versus Pyranocoumarins in Prostate Early Lesions and Neuroendocrine Carcinomas in TRAMP Mice.', 'Calcium and Nuclear Signaling in Prostate Cancer.', 'Low spinophilin expression enhances aggressive biological behavior of breast cancer.']"""

Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) has been the core therapy for men with advanced prostate cancer. It is only in recent years that clinicians began to recognize the cognitive-psychosocial side effects from ADT, which significantly compromise the quality of life of prostate cancer survivors. The objectives of the study are to determine the efficacy of a simple and accessible home-based, walking exercise program in promoting cognitive and psychosocial functions of men with prostate cancer receiving ADT.  Methods:   A 6-month prospective, single-blinded, randomized controlled trial will be conducted to compare the Exercise Group with the Control Group. Twenty men with prostate cancer starting ADT will be recruited and randomly assigned to one of the two groups: the Exercise Group will receive instructions in setting up an individualized 6-month home-based, walking exercise program, while the Control Group will receive standard medical advice from the attending physician. The primary outcomes will be psychosocial and cognitive functions. Cognitive functions including memory, attention, working memory, and executive function will be assessed using a battery of neurocognitive tests at baseline and 6 months. Psychosocial functions including depression, anxiety and self-esteem will be assessed at baseline, 3 and 6 months using the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale, Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, and Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale.  Discussion:   The significance of the cognitive-psychosocial side effects of ADT in men with prostate cancer has only been recently recognized, and the management remains unclear. This study addresses this issue by designing a simple and accessible home-based, exercise program that may potentially have significant impact on reducing the cognitive and psychosocial side effects of ADT, and ultimately improving the health-related quality of life in men with prostate cancer receiving ADT.

Methods:   A total of 708 patients were evaluated regarding urinary continence status at 1 year after surgery from a prospectively maintained radical prostatectomy database. Of these, 73 (10.3%) did not recover urinary continence within 1 year after surgery. For these patients, incontinence status and the number of pads for urinary control were assessed serially.  Results:   In 708 patients, factors associated with the recovery of urinary continence within 1 year after radical prostatectomy were membranous urethral length, prostatic apex shape and patient age. Among 73 patients with urinary incontinence, 41 (56.2%) achieved urinary continence with a mean time of 15.4 months subsequent to the first year after radical prostatectomy (baseline). A younger age at surgery (P = 0.027) and one pad being required (vs ≥2 pads) at baseline (P = 0.046) were identified as independent factors for achievement of urinary continence within a further 2 years. Only the number of pads was a significant factor for further recovery of urinary continence in the longer follow up (hazard ratio 0.36, P = 0.029).  Conclusion:   Compared with factors related to the prostate or membranous urethra, patient age and severity of incontinence at 1 year after radical prostatectomy are more strongly related to the recovery of urinary continence later than 1 year after surgery. These findings might help to decide whether a definite treatment is required for persistent incontinence beyond 1 year after radical prostatectomy.""","""['Seong Jin Jeong', 'Hyeon June Kim', 'Jeong Hyun Kim', 'Jong Jin Oh', 'Sang Cheol Lee', 'Chang Wook Jeong', 'Cheol Yong Yoon', 'Sung Kyu Hong', 'Seok-Soo Byun', 'Sang Eun Lee']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Int J Urol""","""['Impact of variations in prostatic apex shape on early recovery of urinary continence after radical retropubic prostatectomy.', 'Factors determining functional outcomes after radical prostatectomy: robot-assisted versus retropubic.', 'Urinary incontinence after radical prostatectomy: incidence by definition, risk factors and temporal trend in a large series with a long-term follow-up.', 'Preoperative Membranous Urethral Length Measurement and Continence Recovery Following Radical Prostatectomy: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'Risk factors for urinary incontinence after radical prostatectomy.', 'Prediction of Incontinence after Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy: Development and Validation of a 24-Month Incontinence Nomogram.', 'Pelvic floor muscles after prostate radiation therapy: morpho-functional assessment by magnetic resonance imaging, surface electromyography and digital anal palpation.', 'Urodynamic studies prior to urinary incontinence surgery : What is useful?.', 'Unexpected Long-term Improvements in Urinary and Erectile Function in a Large Cohort of Men with Self-reported Outcomes Following Radical Prostatectomy.', 'A new technique of bladder neck reconstruction during radical prostatectomy in patients with prostate cancer.']"""

Castration results in hypoxia in prostate cancer cells, and hypoxia enhances transcriptional activity of AR through hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α at low serum androgen levels mimicking the castration-resistant stage. However, HIF-1α is necessary but not sufficient for hypoxia-activated AR transactivation, and the molecular mechanism that regulates AR function in castration-resistant prostate cancer remains unclear. Here, we report that β-catenin is required for HIF-1α-mediated AR transactivation in hypoxic LNCaP prostate cancer cells under low androgen conditions. HIF-1α and β-catenin coordinately enhanced AR N-terminal and C-terminal interaction. β-Catenin accumulated in the nucleus in the HIF-1α protein-positive cells of LNCaP xenografts in castrated mice. In LNCaP cells, when HIF-1α was knocked down or was exogenously expressed in the cytoplasm, hypoxia-induced nuclear localization of β-catenin was inhibited. β-Catenin formed a complex with HIF-1α both in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm. Hypoxia increased the amount of a complex composed of AR and β-catenin, and knockdown of HIF-1α attenuated the recruitment of AR and β-catenin to the androgen response elements (AREs) of androgen-responsive genes. Furthermore, together with β-catenin, HIF-1α bound to the AREs in the presence of androgen. These results demonstrate that (i) HIF-1α and β-catenin coordinately enhance AR transactivation by accelerating N-terminal and C-terminal interaction; (ii) HIF-1α promotes nuclear translocation of β-catenin in hypoxia; and (iii) AR, HIF-1α, and β-catenin form a ternary complex on AREs.""","""['Takakazu Mitani', 'Naoki Harada', 'Yoshihisa Nakano', 'Hiroshi Inui', 'Ryoichi Yamaji']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""J Biol Chem""","""['Resveratrol inhibits hypoxia-inducible factor-1α-mediated androgen receptor signaling and represses tumor progression in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Hypoxia enhances transcriptional activity of androgen receptor through hypoxia-inducible factor-1α in a low androgen environment.', 'Dual targeting of the androgen receptor and hypoxia-inducible factor 1α pathways synergistically inhibits castration-resistant prostate cancer cells.', 'Interplay Between SOX9, Wnt/β-Catenin and Androgen Receptor Signaling in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Multifaceted interaction between the androgen and Wnt signaling pathways and the implication for prostate cancer.', 'Antagonizing exosomal miR-18a-5p derived from prostate cancer cells ameliorates metastasis-induced osteoblastic lesions by targeting Hist1h2bc and activating Wnt/β-catenin pathway.', 'The role of hypoxia on prostate cancer progression and metastasis.', 'Carotenoid transporter CD36 expression depends on hypoxia-inducible factor-1α in mouse soleus muscles.', 'Adaptation to Hypoxia May Promote Therapeutic Resistance to Androgen Receptor Inhibition in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer.', 'Resistance to second-generation androgen receptor antagonists in prostate cancer.']"""

Molecular alterations of the Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling (SOCS)-3 can contribute to explain the pleiotropic role of interleukin (IL)-6 in this type of cancer. Recently, the methylation of SOCS3 gene has been demonstrated to cause the non-expression of the protein, being involved in the pathogenesis of prostate cancer (PC) and identifying a subset of aggressive tumors. We evaluated the expression of SOCS3 protein in patients (pt) with bioptically-diagnosed PC by immunohistochemical analysis, which is easier to perform, cheaper and more reproducible compared to DNA analysis.  Methods:   We analyzed the protein expression of SOCS3 by immunohistochemistry in 44 patients (pt) with PC diagnosed after biopsy. Slides were incubated with monoclonal antibody SOCS3 (1E4, 1.5 μg/mL; Abnova, Taiwan). The SOCS3 staining intensity was evaluated by two pathologists (FP and LML) in three different ways: positive (+), negative (-) and weak (+/-). Colonic mucosa was used as positive control. 36/44 patients underwent radical prostatectomy (RP).  Results:   Biopsy Gleason score (Gs) was: <7 in 8 pt, 7 in 33 pt (3 + 4 pattern in 21 pt, 4 + 3 pattern in 12 pt), >7 in 3 pt. 8/8 (100%) pt with Gs <7 and 7/33 (21%) with Gs 7 were SOCS+. 15/33 (45%) pt with Gs 7 and 3/3 (100%) pt with Gs >7 were negative. In 11/33 pt (33%) Gs 7 a weak intensity was found so they were classified as SOCS3 +/-.25/36 (69%) patients who underwent RP were SOCS3- (15 pt with Gs 7(3 + 4), 7 pt with Gs 7(4 + 3), 3 pt with Gs 8) and 11/36 (30%) SOCS3+ (8 pt with Gs 6 and 3 pt with Gs 7(3 + 4)) (Tab 2). 12/25 (48%) SOCS3- pt had an organ-confined disease (≤pT2), whereas 13/25 (52%) had an extra prostatic neoplasm (5 pT3a (one was N+), 6 pT3b, 1 pT4). All SOCS3+ patients (8/8 (100%)) had an organ-confined disease. 3/3 (100%) SOCS3+/- pt had an extra prostatic neoplasm (>pT2).  Conclusions:   SOCS3- pt turned out to have a more aggressive disease compared with SOCS3+. In particular, also SOCS3+/- patients seemed to have an aggressive behavior. The non-expression of SOCS3 protein may identify PC with more aggressive behavior and can be evaluated with immunohystochemical analysis, which is a relatively easy and cheap procedure in clinical practice. These results, if confirmed by a wider population and a longer follow-up, may encourage the research on the use of this molecular family as a prognostic marker and a target for therapy with demethylating agents.""","""['Alessandro Calarco', 'Francesco Pinto', 'Francesco Pierconti', 'Emilio Sacco', 'Eleonora Marrucci', 'Angelo Totaro', 'Giuseppe Palermo', 'Matteo Vittori', 'Pierfrancesco Bassi']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Urologia""","""['SOCS3 Immunohistochemical Expression Seems to Support the 2005 and 2014 International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) Modified Gleason Grading System.', 'Epigenetic silencing of SOCS3 identifies a subset of prostate cancer with an aggressive behavior.', 'Radical prostatectomy represents an effective treatment in patients with specimen-confined high pathological Gleason score prostate cancer.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Long-term oncological outcomes after laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.', 'Germ Cell Neoplasia in situ (GCNIS) in Testis-Sparing Surgery (TSS) for Small Testicular Masses (STMs).', 'The Expression Levels of IL-4/IL-13/STAT6 Signaling Pathway Genes and SOCS3 Could Help to Differentiate the Histopathological Subtypes of Non-Small Cell Lung Carcinoma.', 'Prognostic value of ZFP36 and SOCS3 expressions in human prostate cancer.', 'SOCS3 Genetic Polymorphism Is Associated With Clinical Features and Prognosis of Hepatocellular Carcinoma Patients Receiving Hepatectomy.', 'Longitudinal Study of DNA Methylation of Inflammatory Genes and Cancer Risk.']"""

Here we strived to estimate the association of cancer occurrence with the use of insulin glargine.  Methods:   We searched all the publications regarding the association between cancer occurrence and the use of insulin glargine using the US National Library of Medicine's PubMed database. Data were independently extracted and analyzed using random or fixed effects meta-analysis depending upon the degree of heterogeneity.  Results:   Seven cohort studies were included in the meta-analysis. Cancer occurrence had no significant difference in glargine-treated patients compared to patients treated with other insulins (RR=0.86, 95% CI=0.69-1.07, p=0.17, P(heterogeneity)<0.00001). In our subgroup analysis, glargine, compared to other insulins, did not increase the risk of breast cancer (RR=1.14, 95% CI=0.65-2.02, p=0.65, P(heterogeneity)=0.002), prostate cancer (RR=1.00, 95% CI=0.79-1.26, p=0.99, P(heterogeneity)=0.78), pancreatic cancer (RR=0.57, 95% CI=0.14-2.35, p=0.44, P(heterogeneity)=0.0002) and gastrointestinal cancer (RR=0.80, 95% CI=0.62-1.02, p=0.07, P(heterogeneity)=0.86).  Conclusions:   This meta-analysis of open-label studies does not support an increased cancer risk in patients treated with insulin glargine.

Analysis of data from three phase 3 trials was performed to immunologically characterize this therapy during the course of the three doses, and to relate the immunological responses to overall survival (OS).  Methods:   Sipuleucel-T product characteristics [APC numbers, APC activation (CD54 upregulation), and total nucleated cell (TNC) numbers] were assessed in three randomized, controlled phase 3 studies (N = 737). Antigen-specific cellular and humoral responses were assessed in a subset of subjects. The relationships between these parameters and OS were assessed.  Results:   APC activation occurred in the first dose preparation [6.2-fold, (4.65, 7.70); median (25th, 75th percentile)] and increased in the second [10.6-fold (7.83, 13.65)] and third [10.5-fold (7.89, 13.65)] dose preparations. Cytokines and chemokines associated with activated APCs were produced during the manufacture of each dose; T-cell activation-associated cytokines were detected in the second and third dose preparations. Antigen-specific T cells were detectable after administration of the first sipuleucel-T dose. Cumulative APC activation, APC number, and TNC number correlated with OS (P < 0.05). Antigen-specific immune responses were observed in 78.8 % of monitored subjects and their presence correlated with OS (P = 0.003).

To date, observational data from prospective cohort studies investigating the relationship between green and black tea intake and prostate cancer risk are sparse and equivocal. In a population-based, prospective cohort study of Chinese men in Singapore, we investigated the relationship between green and black tea intake and prostate cancer risk.  Methods:   Tea consumption data for 27,293 men were collected at baseline (between 1993 and 1998) using a validated food frequency questionnaire. After an average of 11.2 years of follow-up, 298 men had developed prostate cancer. Proportional hazards regression methods were used to assess the associations between tea intake and prostate cancer risk.  Results:   There was no association between daily green tea intake and prostate cancer risk, compared with no green tea intake [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.08; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.79, 1.47]. For black tea, a statistically significant positive association and trend were observed for daily intake compared with no black tea intake (HR = 1.41, 95 % CI 1.03, 1.92; p for trend <0.01)  Conclusions:   Few prospective data are available from populations that have both a high level and wide range of black and green tea intake; this study represents a unique opportunity to evaluate their individual effects on prostate cancer risk.

The mean size of the lesions was 2 (1-4) cm. All of the rectal injuries were recognized during the operation, and double-layered sutures were used for the primary repair. None of the cases required colostomy procedure. No postoperative complications were encountered in 6 of the patients; however, 1 patient underwent a second operation on the following day due to detachment at the injury site.

NBS is characterized by specific physical characteristics (microcephaly and dysmorphic facies), immunodeficiency, and increased risk of malignancy. Individuals who are heterozygous for NBN mutations are clinically asymptomatic, but may display an elevated risk for certain cancers including, but not limited to, ovarian and prostate cancer as well as various lymphoid malignancies. In this study, 94 unrelated familial prostate cancer cases from the University of Michigan Prostate Cancer Genetics Project (n = 54) and Johns Hopkins University (n = 40) were subjected to targeted next-generation sequencing of the exons, including UTRs, of NBN. One individual of European descent, diagnosed with prostate cancer at age 52, was identified to have a heterozygous 2117 C > G mutation in exon 14 of the gene, that results in a premature stop at codon 706 (S706X). Sequencing of germline DNA from additional male relatives showed partial co-segregation of the NBN S706X mutation with prostate cancer. This NBN mutation was not observed among 2768 unrelated European men (1859 with prostate cancer and 909 controls). NBN is involved in double-strand break repair as a component of the MRE11 (meiotic recombination 11)/RAD50/NBN genomic stability complex.

Intra-operative procedural differences between the two surgical approaches may alter the molecular composition of resected surgical specimens, which are indispensable for molecular analysis and biomarker evaluation. The objective of this study is to investigate the effect of different surgical procedures on RNA quality and genome-wide expression signature. RNA integrity number (RIN) values were compared between total RNA samples extracted from consecutive LRP (n=11) and ORP (n=24) prostate specimens. Expression profiling was performed using the Agilent human whole-genome expression microarrays. Expression differences by surgical type were analyzed by Volcano plot analysis and gene ontology analysis. Quantitative reverse transcription (RT)-PCR was used for expression validation in an independent set of LRP (n=8) and ORP (n=8) samples. The LRP procedure did not compromise RNA integrity. Differential gene expression by surgery types was limited to a small subset of genes, the number of which was smaller than that expected by chance. Unexpectedly, this small subset of differentially expressed genes was enriched for those encoding transcription factors, oxygen transporters and other previously reported surgery-induced stress-response genes, and demonstrated unidirectional reduction in LRP specimens in comparison to ORP specimens. The effect of the LRP procedure on RNA quality and genome-wide transcript levels is negligible, supporting the suitability of LRP surgical specimens for routine molecular analysis. Blunted in vivo stress response in LRP specimens, likely mediated by CO(2) insufflation but not by longer ischemia time, is manifested in the reduced expression of stress-response genes in these specimens.""","""['Jie Li', 'Zhi-Hong Zhang', 'Chang-Jun Yin', 'Christian Pavlovich', 'Jun Luo', 'Robert Getzenberg', 'Wei Zhang']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Asian J Androl""","""[""Open, laparoscopic and robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy: comparative analysis of operative and pathologic outcomes for three techniques with a single surgeon's experience."", 'Laparoscopic and robotic-assisted versus open radical prostatectomy for the treatment of localised prostate cancer.', 'Patterns-of-care and health economic analysis of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy in the Australian public health system.', 'Laparoscopic and robot-assisted vs open radical prostatectomy for the treatment of localized prostate cancer: a Cochrane systematic review.', 'Comparison of retropubic, laparoscopic and robotic radical prostatectomy: who is the winner?', 'Biobanking of derivatives from radical retropubic and robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy tissues as part of the prostate cancer biorepository network.', 'Gene panel model predictive of outcome in patients with prostate cancer.']"""

In this study, we have used this algorithm to investigate the relationship between plan quality and the extent of the beam direction search space, i.e. the set of candidate beam directions that may be selected for generating an optimal plan. For a group of ten prostate cancer patients, optimal IMRT plans were made for stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT), mimicking high dose rate brachytherapy dosimetry. Plans were generated for five different beam direction input sets: a coplanar (CP) set and four non-coplanar (NCP) sets. For CP treatments, the search space consisted of 72 orientations (5° separations). The NCP CyberKnife (CK) space contained all directions available in the robotic CK treatment unit. The fully non-coplanar (F-NCP) set facilitated the highest possible degree of freedom in selecting optimal directions. CK(+) and CK(++) were subsets of F-NCP to investigate some aspects of the CK space. For each input set, plans were generated with up to 30 selected beam directions. Generated plans were clinically acceptable, according to an assessment of our clinicians. Convergence in plan quality occurred only after around 20 included beams. For individual patients, variations in PTV dose delivery between the five generated plans were minimal, as aimed for (average spread in V(95): 0.4%). This allowed plan comparisons based on organ at risk (OAR) doses, with the rectum considered most important. Plans generated with the NCP search spaces had improved OAR sparing compared to the CP search space, especially for the rectum. OAR sparing was best with the F-NCP, with reductions in rectum D(Mean), V(40Gy), V(60Gy) and D(2%) compared to CP of 25%, 35%, 37% and 8%, respectively. Reduced rectum sparing with the CK search space compared to F-NCP could be largely compensated by expanding CK with beams with relatively large direction components along the superior-inferior axis (CK(++)). Addition of posterior beams (CK(++) → F-NCP) did not lead to further improvements in OAR sparing. Plans with 25 beams clearly performed better than 11-beam plans. For CP plans, an increase from 11 to 25 involved beams resulted in reductions in rectum D(Mean), V(40Gy), V(60Gy) and D(2%) of 39%, 57%, 64% and 13%, respectively.""","""['Linda Rossi', 'Sebastiaan Breedveld', 'Ben J M Heijmen', 'Peter W J Voet', 'Nico Lanconelli', 'Shafak Aluwini']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['SU-E-T-647: Plan Quality in Computerized Non-Coplanar IMRT Beam Angle Optimization is Highly Dependent on the Extent of the Beam direction Search Space.', 'Development of methods for beam angle optimization for IMRT using an accelerated exhaustive search strategy.', 'Automated non-coplanar beam direction optimization improves IMRT in SBRT of liver metastasis.', 'Efficacy of flattening-filter-free beam in stereotactic body radiation therapy planning and treatment: A systematic review with meta-analysis.', 'Advances in Radiotherapy for Prostate Cancer Treatment.', 'Using Artificial Intelligence for Optimization of the Processes and Resource Utilization in Radiotherapy.', 'Enhancing Radiotherapy for Locally Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Patients with iCE, a Novel System for Automated Multi-Criterial Treatment Planning Including Beam Angle Optimization.', 'MR-Linac Radiotherapy - The Beam Angle Selection Problem.', 'Complementing Prostate SBRT VMAT With a Two-Beam Non-Coplanar IMRT Class Solution to Enhance Rectum and Bladder Sparing With Minimum Increase in Treatment Time.', 'A practical method for predicting patient-specific collision in radiotherapy.']"""

In the present study, we examined the role of organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATPs) as importers of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) into cells to support growth under androgen-depleted conditions. Cell growth and mRNA expression of OATP genes were studied in human prostate cancer LNCaP and 22Rv1 cells under androgen-depleted conditions. The stimulatory effect of DHEAS on cell growth was investigated in LNCaP cells in which OATP1A2 had been silenced. Growth of both cell lines was stimulated by DHEAS and the effect was attenuated by STX64, an inhibitor of steroid sulfatase which can covert DHEAS to DHEA. OATP1A2 mRNA expression was increased most prominently among various genes tested in LNCaP cells grown in androgen-depleted medium. Similar results were obtained with 22Rv1 cells. Furthermore, the characteristics of [(3)H]DHEAS uptake by LNCaP cells were consistent with those of OATP-mediated transport. Knockdown of OATP1A2 in LNCaP cells resulted in loss of the DHEAS sensitivity of cell growth. Our results suggest that enhanced OATP1A2 expression is associated with adaptive cell growth of prostate cancer cells under androgen-depleted conditions.

In this study, an offline process for the integral component IGART framework has been implemented that consists of deformable image registration (DIR) and its validation, dose reconstruction, dose accumulation and dose verification. This study compares the differences between planned and estimated delivered doses under an IGART framework of five patients undergoing prostate cancer radiation therapy. The dose calculation accuracy on CBCT was verified by measurements made in a Rando pelvic phantom. The accuracy of DIR on patient image sets was evaluated in three ways: landmark matching with fiducial markers, visual image evaluation and unbalanced energy (UE); UE has been previously demonstrated to be a feasible method for the validation of DIR accuracy at a voxel level.

Components of tissue microenvironments are recognized to profoundly influence cellular phenotypes, including susceptibilities to toxic insults. Using a genome-wide analysis of transcriptional responses to genotoxic stress induced by cancer therapeutics, we identified a spectrum of secreted proteins derived from the tumor microenvironment that includes the Wnt family member wingless-type MMTV integration site family member 16B (WNT16B). We determined that WNT16B expression is regulated by nuclear factor of κ light polypeptide gene enhancer in B cells 1 (NF-κB) after DNA damage and subsequently signals in a paracrine manner to activate the canonical Wnt program in tumor cells. The expression of WNT16B in the prostate tumor microenvironment attenuated the effects of cytotoxic chemotherapy in vivo, promoting tumor cell survival and disease progression.

Microarray meta-analysis has become a frequently used tool in biomedical research. Little effort, however, has been made to develop a systematic pipeline and user-friendly software. In this article, we present MetaOmics, a suite of three R packages MetaQC, MetaDE and MetaPath, for quality control, differentially expressed gene identification and enriched pathway detection for microarray meta-analysis. MetaQC provides a quantitative and objective tool to assist study inclusion/exclusion criteria for meta-analysis. MetaDE and MetaPath were developed for candidate marker and pathway detection, which provide choices of marker detection, meta-analysis and pathway analysis methods. The system allows flexible input of experimental data, clinical outcome (case-control, multi-class, continuous or survival) and pathway databases. It allows missing values in experimental data and utilizes multi-core parallel computing for fast implementation. It generates informative summary output and visualization plots, operates on different operation systems and can be expanded to include new algorithms or combine different types of genomic data. This software suite provides a comprehensive tool to conveniently implement and compare various genomic meta-analysis pipelines.

Radiation therapy (RT) has proven effective in bone (BM) and brain (BrM) metastases. The objective of this study was to analyze the variability of RT utilization rates in clinical practice and the accessibility to medical technology in our region.  Patients and methods:   We reviewed the clinical records and RT treatment sheets of all patients undergoing RT for BM and/or BrM during 2007 in the 12 public hospitals in an autonomous region of Spain. Data were gathered on hospital type, patient type and RT treatment characteristics. Calculation of the rate of RT use was based on the cancer incidence and the number of RT treatments for BM, BrM and all cancer sites.  Results:   Out of the 9319 patients undergoing RT during 2007 for cancer at any site, 1242 (13.3%; inter-hospital range, 26.3%) received RT for BM (n = 744) or BrM (n = 498). These 1242 patients represented 79% of all RT treatments with palliative intent, and the most frequent primary tumours were in lung, breast, prostate or digestive system. No significant difference between BM and BrM groups were observed in: mean age (62 vs. 59 yrs, respectively); gender (approximately 64% male and 36% female in both); performance status (ECOG 0-1 in 70 vs. 71%); or mean distance from hospital (36 vs. 28.6 km) or time from consultation to RT treatment (13 vs. 14.3 days). RT regimens differed among hospitals and between patient groups: 10 × 300 cGy, 5 × 400 cGy and 1x800cGy were applied in 32, 27 and 25%, respectively, of BM patients, whereas 10 × 300cGy was used in 49% of BrM patients.  Conclusions:   Palliative RT use in BM and BrM is high and close to the expected rate, unlike the global rate of RT application for all cancers in our setting. Differences in RT schedules among hospitals may reflect variability in clinical practice among the medical teams.""","""['Jose Expósito', 'Javier Jaén', 'Enrique Alonso', 'Isabel Tovar']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Radiat Oncol""","""['The role of palliative radiotherapy for brain metastases.', 'Patterns of practice of palliative radiotherapy in Africa, Part 1: Bone and brain metastases.', 'Patterns of care among patients receiving radiation therapy for bone metastases at a large academic institution.', 'Radiotherapy for palliation of symptoms in incurable cancer.', 'Effect of the types of pretreatment imaging modalities on the treatment response to palliative radiation for painful bone metastases from solid cancer: a single-center retrospective analysis.', 'The efficacy of three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy on pain and quality of life in patients with painful bone metastases: a prospective study.', 'Palliative Radiotherapy for the Management of Metastatic Cancer: Bone Metastases, Spinal Cord Compression, and Brain Metastases.', 'Evaluation of the utilization of external radiotherapy in the treatment of localized prostate cancer in Andalusia, Spain.', 'Health Resource Utilization Associated with Skeletal-Related Events in Patients with Advanced Prostate Cancer: A European Subgroup Analysis from an Observational, Multinational Study.', 'Palliative radiotherapy for bone metastases from lung cancer: Evidence-based medicine?']"""

Naturally processed HLA-A2 restricted peptides presented by breast, ovarian and prostate cancer cells were used as antigens to create a therapeutic cancer vaccine, DPX-0907.  Methods:   A phase I clinical study was designed to examine the safety and immune activating potential of DPX-0907 in advanced stage breast, ovarian and prostate cancer patients. A total of 23 late stage cancer patients were recruited and were divided into two dose/volume cohorts in a three immunization protocol.  Results:   DPX-0907 was shown to be safe with injection site reactions being the most commonly reported adverse event. All breast cancer patients (3/3), most of ovarian (5/6) and one third of prostate (3/9) cancer patients exhibited detectable immune responses, resulting in a 61% immunological response rate. Immune responses were generally observed in patients with better disease control after their last prior treatment. Antigen-specific responses were detected in 73% of immune responders (44% of evaluable patients) after the first vaccination. In 83% of immune responders (50% of evaluable patients), peptide-specific T cell responses were detected at ≥2 time points post vaccination with 64% of the responders (39% of evaluable patients) showing evidence of immune persistence. Immune monitoring also demonstrated the generation of antigen-specific T cell memory with the ability to secrete multiple Type 1 cytokines.  Conclusions:   The novel DepoVax formulation promotes multifunctional effector memory responses to peptide-based tumor associated antigens. The data supports the capacity of DPX-0907 to elicit Type-1 biased immune responses, warranting further clinical development of the vaccine.

Decision Boxes aim to prepare the clinician to communicate the risks and benefits of the available options to the patient so they can make an informed decision together.  Methods:   Seven researchers (including four practicing family physicians) selected 10 clinical topics relevant to primary care practice through a Delphi survey. We then developed two one-page prototypes on two of these topics: prostate cancer screening with the prostate-specific antigen test, and prenatal screening for trisomy 21 with the serum integrated test. We presented the prototypes to purposeful samples of family physicians distributed in two focus groups, and patients distributed in four focus groups. We used the User Experience Honeycomb to explore barriers and facilitators to the communication design used in Decision Boxes. All discussions were transcribed, and three researchers proceeded to thematic content analysis of the transcriptions. The coding scheme was first developed from the Honeycomb's seven themes (valuable, usable, credible, useful, desirable, accessible, and findable), and included new themes suggested by the data. Prototypes were modified in light of our findings.  Results:   Three rounds were necessary for a majority of researchers to select 10 clinical topics. Fifteen physicians and 33 patients participated in the focus groups. Following analyses, three sections were added to the Decision Boxes: introduction, patient counseling, and references. The information was spread to two pages to try to make the Decision Boxes less busy and improve users' first impression. To try to improve credibility, we gave more visibility to the research institutions involved in development. A statement on the boxes' purpose and a flow chart representing the shared decision-making process were added with the intent of clarifying the tool's purpose. Information about the risks and benefits according to risk levels was added to the Decision Boxes, to try to ease the adaptation of the information to individual patients.

Material and methods:   This national study prospectively assessed 521 preoperatively continent patients with prostate cancer (PCa), scheduled for RP by surgeons with high (>50), medium (20-50) or low annual volume (<20) at 14 urological departments in Norway. Patients responded to UI questions from the Expanded Composite prostate cancer index (EPIC-50) before and 1 year after RP. UI was defined as ""use of pad(s)"" and/or ""a moderate or severe urinary leakage problem (ULP)"". Preoperative prediction of PSMs and UI was explored in multivariate regression analyses with the following independent variables: surgeons' annual RP volume, type of hospital (university versus community), patient's health, sociodemographic features and PCa characteristics.  Results:   Based on histopathological reports, the overall PSM rate was 26%, with differences between the high- (18%), medium- (28%) and low-volume (44%) groups. Increasing PSM rates were predicted by surgeons belonging to the low- and medium-volume categories, prostate-specific antigen> 10 µg/l, Gleason score >7, patient age >65 years and <12 years of education.

Serotonin or 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) is a well-known neurotransmitter that mediates a wide variety of physiological effects. An increase in the number of 5-HT-releasing neuroendocrine (NE) cells has been correlated with tumor progression. However, it is particularly unclear whether released 5-HT or the release of 5-HT has a role in tumor cell growth. We hypothesized that 5-HT synthesis and metabolism in NE cells regulate the growth of prostate cancer cells. In the present study, 5-HT was found to play a role as a cell growth factor in prostate cancer cells. Moreover, the pharmacological inhibition of 5-HT synthesis and metabolism interrupted the growth of prostate cancer cells. To confirm the existence of 5-HT in prostate cancer cells, we performed ELISA, HPLC, RT-PCR and immunohistochemical analyses. A high expression of tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH-1), dopa decarboxylase (DDC) and monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) was noted in the prostate cancer cells when compared with normal prostate cells. Previous studies showed that 5-HT stimulated the proliferation of prostate cancer cells mediated by 5-HT receptors 5-HTR1A and R1B. However, cell proliferation was significantly inhibited when siRNA for both DDC and TPH-1 was transfected to the cells. Consequently, we propose that the secretion system of prostate NE cells capable of 5-HT synthesis and metabolism plays a significant role in prostate tumor generation and progression. These findings provide crucial clues for the development of potential pharmacotherapeutics to slow prostate tumor progression.""","""['Toshiaki Shinka', 'Dai Onodera', 'Tetsuji Tanaka', 'Noriaki Shoji', 'Tadaaki Miyazaki', 'Tetsuya Moriuchi', 'Takahiro Fukumoto']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Oncol Lett""","""['Serotonin Pathway in Cancer.', 'Expression of serotonin receptors and role of serotonin in human prostate cancer tissue and cell lines.', 'Increased Serotonin Signaling Contributes to the Warburg Effect in Pancreatic Tumor Cells Under Metabolic Stress and Promotes Growth of Pancreatic Tumors in Mice.', 'Lead and Aroclor 1254 disrupt reproductive neuroendocrine function in Atlantic croaker.', 'From genes to aggressive behavior: the role of serotonergic system.', 'Serotonin acts through YAP to promote cell proliferation: mechanism and implication in colorectal cancer progression.', 'Endocrine and paracrine characteristics of neuroendocrine prostate cancer.', 'Regulation of Neuroendocrine-like Differentiation in Prostate Cancer by Non-Coding RNAs.', 'Serotonin Pathway in Cancer.', 'Effects and related mechanisms of serotonin on malignant biological behavior of hepatocellular carcinoma via regulation of Yap.']"""

To date, the conventional treatments for retinoblastoma have been enucleation, cryotherapy, external beam radiotherapy, or chemotherapy. Most of these treatments, however, have possible side effects, including blindness, infections, fever, gastrointestinal toxicity, and neurotoxicity. More effective treatments are therefore imperative. Gossypol has been reported as a potential inhibitor of cell proliferation in various types of cancers, such as prostate cancer, breast cancer, leukemia, and lung cancer. This study investigates the possible antiproliferative effect of gossypol on retinoblastoma.  Methods:   Human retinoblastoma cells were cultured with various concentrations of gossypol and checked for cell viability with a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Nuclear condensation caused by cell apoptosis was detected by staining retinoblastoma cells with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), counting those with condensed nuclei, and determining the percentage of apoptotic cells. In addition, the stages of apoptosis and phases in cell cycles were examined with flow cytometry. The possible signal transduction pathways involved were examined with a protein array assay and western blot analysis.  Results:   After incubation, the cell survival rate was significantly lower after treatment with 5, 10, and 20 µM of gossypol. The maximum antisurvival effect of gossypol was observed at 20 µM, and the number of apoptotic cells was higher in the preparations cultured with 10 and 20 µM of gossypol. The results in flow cytometry indicated that at concentrations of 10 and 20 µM, gossypol increased the proportion of early- and late-apoptotic retinoblastoma cells and induced cell arrest of retinoblastoma cells at the same concentrations. This antiproliferative effect was later confirmed by upregulating the expression of death receptor 5 (DR5), caspase 8, caspase 9, caspase 3, cytochrome C, tumor protein 53 (p53), and second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases (Smac) in the signal transduction pathways.  Conclusions:   We concluded that gossypol has an antiproliferative effect on retinoblastoma cells.""","""['Wei-Ting Hsiao', 'Ming-Dar Tsai', 'Guey-Mei Jow', 'Lu-Tai Tien', 'Yih-Jing Lee']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Mol Vis""","""['Mitochondria as the primary target of resveratrol-induced apoptosis in human retinoblastoma cells.', 'Gossypol induces death receptor-5 through activation of the ROS-ERK-CHOP pathway and sensitizes colon cancer cells to TRAIL.', 'Gossypol reduction of tumor growth through ROS-dependent mitochondria pathway in human colorectal carcinoma cells.', 'Apoptotic proteins with non-apoptotic activity: expression and function in cancer.', 'Targeting apoptotic caspases in cancer.', 'Systematic Review of Gossypol/AT-101 in Cancer Clinical Trials.', 'Transcriptional characterization and response to defense elicitors of mevalonate pathway genes in cotton (Gossypium arboreum L.).', 'Pentoxifylline Enhances the Apoptotic Effect of Carboplatin in Y79 Retinoblastoma Cells.', 'Effect of the BH3 Mimetic Polyphenol (-)-Gossypol (AT-101) on the in vitro and in vivo Growth of Malignant Mesothelioma.', 'Anti-inflammatory Effects of Gossypol on Human Lymphocytic Jurkat Cells via Regulation of MAPK Signaling and Cell Cycle.']"""

The prostate stem cell Ag (PSCA) is a promising target for immunotherapy of advanced disease. Based on a novel mAb directed to PSCA, we established and compared a series of murine and humanized anti-CD3-anti-PSCA single-chain bispecific Abs. Their capability to redirect T cells for killing of tumor cells was analyzed. During these studies, we identified a novel bispecific humanized Ab that efficiently retargets T cells to tumor cells in a strictly Ag-dependent manner and at femtomolar concentrations. T cell activation, cytokine release, and lysis of target cells depend on a cross-linkage of redirected T cells with tumor cells, whereas binding of the anti-CD3 domain alone does not lead to an activation or cytokine release. Interestingly, both CD8+ and CD4+ T cells are activated in parallel and can efficiently mediate the lysis of tumor cells. However, the onset of killing via CD4+ T cells is delayed. Furthermore, redirecting T cells via the novel humanized bispecific Abs results in a delay of tumor growth in xenografted nude mice.""","""['Anja Feldmann', 'Claudia Arndt', 'Katrin Töpfer', 'Slava Stamova', 'Franziska Krone', 'Marc Cartellieri', 'Stefanie Koristka', 'Irene Michalk', 'Dirk Lindemann', 'Marc Schmitz', 'Achim Temme', 'Martin Bornhäuser', 'Gerhard Ehninger', 'Michael Bachmann']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""J Immunol""","""['Redirection of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes via a novel antibody-based modular targeting system triggers efficient killing of PSCA+ prostate tumor cells.', 'Dual antigen target-based immunotherapy for prostate cancer eliminates the growth of established tumors in mice.', 'Target-dependent T-cell activation by coligation with a PSMA x CD3 diabody induces lysis of prostate cancer cells.', 'Advances in specific immunotherapy for prostate cancer.', 'Novel Redirected T-Cell Immunotherapies for Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'Specific and safe targeting of glioblastoma using switchable and logic-gated RevCAR T cells.', 'Palbociclib impairs the proliferative capacity of activated T cells while retaining their cytotoxic efficacy.', 'Single-Chain Fragment Variable: Recent Progress in Cancer Diagnosis and Therapy.', 'The present and future of immunocytokines for cancer treatment.', 'Combining Radiation- with Immunotherapy in Prostate Cancer: Influence of Radiation on T Cells.']"""

This paper presents a novel approach to fully automatically segment the prostate, including its seminal vesicles, within a few minutes of a magnetic resonance (MR) scan acquired without an endorectal coil. Such MR images are important in external beam radiation therapy, where using an endorectal coil is highly undesirable. The segmentation is obtained using a deformable model that is trained on-the-fly so that it is specific to the patient's scan. This case specific deformable model consists of a patient specific initialized triangulated surface and image feature model that are trained during its initialization. The image feature model is used to deform the initialized surface by template matching image features (via normalized cross-correlation) to the features of the scan. The resulting deformations are regularized over the surface via well established simple surface smoothing algorithms, which is then made anatomically valid via an optimized shape model. Mean and median Dice's similarity coefficients (DSCs) of 0.85 and 0.87 were achieved when segmenting 3T MR clinical scans of 50 patients. The median DSC result was equal to the inter-rater DSC and had a mean absolute surface error of 1.85 mm.

Here, we report that a mechanosensitive Ca(2+)-permeable cation channel (MscCa) is expressed in the highly migratory/invasive human PC cell line, PC-3 and that inhibition of MscCa by Gd(3+) or GsMTx-4 blocks PC-3 cell migration and associated elevations in [Ca(2+)](i). Genetic suppression or overexpression of specific members of the canonical transient receptor potential Ca(2+) channel family (TRPC1 and TRPC3) also inhibit PC-3 cell migration, but they do so by mechanisms other that altering MscCa activity. Although LNCaP cells are nonmigratory, they also express relatively large MscCa currents, indicating that MscCa expression alone cannot confer motility on PC cells. MscCa in both cell lines show similar conductance and ion selectivity and both are functionally coupled via Ca(2+) influx to a small Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channel. However, MscCa in PC-3 and LNCaP cell patches show markedly different gating dynamics--while PC-3 cells typically express a sustained, non-inactivating MscCa current, LNCaP cells express a mechanically-fragile, rapidly inactivating MscCa current. Moreover, mechanical forces applied to the patch, can induce an irreversible transition from the transient to the sustained MscCa gating mode. Given that cancer cells experience increasing compressive and shear forces within a growing tumor, a similar shift in channel gating in situ would have significant effects on Ca(2+) signaling that may play a role in tumor progression.""","""['Rosario Maroto', 'Alexander Kurosky', 'Owen P Hamill']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Channels (Austin)""","""['TRPC1 forms the stretch-activated cation channel in vertebrate cells.', 'TRPC1 channels regulate directionality of migrating cells.', 'Calcium store contents control the expression of TRPC1, TRPC3 and TRPV6 proteins in LNCaP prostate cancer cell line.', 'Transient Receptor Potential Canonical (TRPC) Channels as Modulators of Migration and Invasion.', 'Transient receptor potential channels in endothelium: solving the calcium entry puzzle?', 'Microglial amyloid beta clearance is driven by PIEZO1 channels.', 'Biophysical interactions between components of the tumor microenvironment promote metastasis.', 'PIEZO1 Is Selectively Expressed in Small Diameter Mouse DRG Neurons Distinct From Neurons Strongly Expressing TRPV1.', 'Feeling Stress: The Mechanics of Cancer Progression and Aggression.', 'Mechanical Transduction and the Dark Energy of Biology.']"""

Objective:   We describe a technique of transanal endoscopic low and middle rectal dissection with subsequent coloanal anastomosis via single-port laparoscopy, with the aim of reducing technical problems, increasing safety, and improving cosmesis after resection of rectal cancer.  Design and setting:   This was an observational study conducted in a large, tertiary care cancer center in France.  Patients:   Consecutive patients with rectal adenocarcinoma requiring total mesorectal excision with a coloanal anastomosis were evaluated for eligibility to undergo the procedure. Patients were selected if they had 1 or more of the following risk factors: narrow pelvis, a voluminous prostate, or obesity.  Intervention:   After an anal mucosectomy, the rectal wall was circumferentially transected above the external sphincter and a transanal trocar was introduced. The dissection of the mesorectum was completely performed via endoscopy up to the Douglas rectovesical pouch. A single port was inserted at the future site of the transient ileostomy, and a left colectomy and a lymphadenectomy were performed. The upper rectum dissection enabled joining the transanal rectal plane of dissection. Then the splenic flexure was completely mobilized and the specimen was extracted through the site of the future ileostomy.  Outcome measures:   Operative time, blood loss, duration of hospital stay, and histopathologic variables (margins, number of harvested lymph nodes, grade of the mesorectal fascia dissection) were recorded, and the quality of the surgical plane was assessed. The Cleveland Clinic Florida (Wexner) fecal incontinence questionnaire was administered after ileostomy closure.  Results:   Four consecutive male patients with rectal cancer in a narrow pelvis were treated with this new approach. No conversion (by laparotomy or multiport laparoscopy) was necessary. The pathologic variables were satisfactory and the Wexner scores indicated no severe incontinence after ileostomy closure. The postoperative follow-up was uneventful except for an anastomotic fistula which developed in 1 patient and was treated without reoperation.  Limitations:   The study was limited by the small number of patients and the fact that no women and no obese patients were included.  Conclusions:   Rectal resection via the transanal approach combined with single-port laparoscopic assistance may be easier and safer than the traditional approach, especially in male patients who have a narrow pelvis.

In contrast, alkaline phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase and C-reactive protein levels were significantly higher in the short-term DOC group. The period from the start of primary endocrine therapy to CRPC diagnosis was significantly longer in the long-term DOC group (p=0.0008).

Pelvic SNs localized on SPECT/CT and LN metastases detected by 18 F-FCH PET/CT were compared to standard pelvic clinical target volumes (CTV).  Results:   A total of 104 pelvic SNs were identified on SPECT/CT (mean 5.2 SNs/patient; range 1-10).

The absence of EpCAM in normal lymphatics makes it an attractive marker for studying lymph node (LN) metastases of carcinomas to improve LN staging accuracy. Herein, we developed and quantitatively compared dual-labeled monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) of varying affinities against EpCAM for both noninvasive and intraoperative detection of metastatic LNs in prostate cancer.  Methods:   A panel of hybridoma-derived anti-EpCAM mAbs was generated and screened. Two high-affinity candidate mAbs with specificity for nonoverlapping epitopes on the EpCAM extracellular domain were chosen for further evaluation.

Within 18-24 h, noninvasive small-animal PET/CT and in vivo, in situ, and ex vivo DsRed reporter gene and near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging were performed to detect primary tumors and metastatic LNs. Using DsRed fluorescence as the true indicator of cancer-positive tissue, we performed receiver operating characteristic curve analyses of percentage injected dose per gram measured from quantitative small-animal PET/CT and fluorescence intensity measured from semiquantitative NIRF imaging for each LN examined to compare mAb sensitivity and specificity.  Results:   mAbs 7 and 153 generated in-house were found to have higher affinity than commercial mAb 9601.

This protein is a promising target for antimitotic monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE)-based antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) therapy. Nonlinear pharmacokinetics in normal mice suggested that antigen expression in normal tissues may contribute to targeted mediated disposition. We evaluated a predosing strategy with unconjugated antibody to block ADC uptake in target-expressing tissues in a mouse model while striving to preserve tumor uptake and efficacy.  Methods:   Unconjugated, unlabeled antibody was preadministered to mice bearing the TENB2-expressing human prostate explant model, LuCaP 77, followed by a single administration of (111)In-labeled anti-TENB2-MMAE for biodistribution and SPECT/CT studies. A tumor-growth-inhibition study was conducted to determine the pharmacodynamic consequences of predosing.  Results:   Preadministration of anti-TENB2 at 1 mg/kg significantly increased blood exposure of the radiolabeled ADC and reduced intestinal, hepatic, and splenic uptake while not affecting tumor accretion. Similar tumor-to-heart ratios were measured by SPECT/CT at 24 h with and without the predose. Consistent with this, the preadministration of 0.75 mg/kg did not interfere with efficacy in a tumor-growth study dosed at 0.75 mg or 2.5 mg of ADC per kilogram.

For a more direct assessment of the function of PTTG1 in prostate tumorigenesis, RNAi-mediated knockdown was used to selectively decrease PTTG1 expression in PC3 human prostate tumor cells. After three weeks of selection, colonies stably transfected with PTTG1-targeted RNAi (the knockdown PC3 cell line) or empty vector (the control PC3 cell line) were selected and expanded to investigate the role of PTTG1 expression in PC3 cell growth and invasion. Cell proliferation rate was significantly slower (28%) in the PTTG1 knockdown line after 6 days of growth as indicated by an MTT cell viability assay (P < 0.05). Similarly, a soft agar colony formation assay revealed significantly fewer (66.7%) PTTG1 knockdown PC3 cell colonies than control colonies after three weeks of growth. In addition, PTTG1 knockdown resulted in cell cycle arrest at G1 as indicated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. The PTTG1 knockdown PC3 cell line also exhibited significantly reduced migration through Matrigel in a transwell assay of invasive potential, and down-regulation of PTTG1 could lead to increased sensitivity of these prostate cancer cells to a commonly used anticancer drug, taxol.

Other prostate cell lines (PZ-HPV-7, CA-HPV-10, and DU145 cells) expressed extremely low levels of GDF15. Stable overexpression of GDF15 in PC-3 cells enhanced the degree of cell proliferation and invasion as shown in the (3)H-thymidine incorporation assay and in the Matrigel invasion assay respectively. Soft agar assays and xenograft animal studies indicated that overexpression of GDF15 in PC-3 cells increased tumorigenesis in vitro and in vivo.

Further studies revealed that overexpression of IL6 enhanced GDF15 expression in LNCaP cells while knockdown of IL6 blocked the expression of GDF15 in PC-3 cells, suggesting that expression of GDF15 is upregulated by IL6. This study demonstrated that expression of GDF15 induces cell proliferation, invasion, and tumorigenesis of prostate carcinoma PC-3 cells. The enhancement of tumorigenesis and invasiveness of prostate carcinoma cells that stably overexpress GDF15 may be caused by the dysregulation of maspin, matriptase, and IL6 gene expression.

Elevated activity of the AR is often associated with this highly aggressive disease state. Therefore, new therapeutic regimens that target and modulate AR activity could prove beneficial. We previously introduced a versatile chemical platform to generate competitive and non-competitive multivalent peptoid oligomer conjugates that modulate AR activity. In particular, we identified a linear and a cyclic divalent ethisterone conjugate that exhibit potent anti-proliferative properties in LNCaP-abl cells, a model of castrate-resistant prostate cancer. Here, we characterize the mechanism of action of these compounds utilizing confocal microscopy, time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer, chromatin immunoprecipitation, flow cytometry, and microarray analysis. The linear conjugate competitively blocks AR action by inhibiting DNA binding. In addition, the linear conjugate does not promote AR nuclear localization or co-activator binding. In contrast, the cyclic conjugate promotes AR nuclear localization and induces cell-cycle arrest, despite its inability to compete against endogenous ligand for binding to AR in vitro. Genome-wide expression analysis reveals that gene transcripts are differentially affected by treatment with the linear or cyclic conjugate. Although the divalent ethisterone conjugates share extensive chemical similarities, we illustrate that they can antagonize the AR via distinct mechanisms of action, establishing new therapeutic strategies for potential applications in AR pharmacology.""","""['Paul M Levine', 'Eugine Lee', 'Alex Greenfield', 'Richard Bonneau', 'Susan K Logan', 'Michael J Garabedian', 'Kent Kirshenbaum']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""ACS Chem Biol""","""['Multivalent Peptoid Conjugates Which Overcome Enzalutamide Resistance in Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Multivalent peptidomimetic conjugates: a versatile platform for modulating androgen receptor activity.', 'A novel androgen receptor antagonist JJ-450 inhibits enzalutamide-resistant mutant ARF876L nuclear import and function.', 'Androgen receptor-dependent and -independent mechanisms driving prostate cancer progression: Opportunities for therapeutic targeting from multiple angles.', 'Strategies for targeting the androgen receptor axis in prostate cancer.', 'Electrochemical vicinal oxyazidation of α-arylvinyl acetates.', 'Multivalent Peptoid Conjugates Which Overcome Enzalutamide Resistance in Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Unbiased Selection of Peptide-Peptoid Hybrids Specific for Lung Cancer Compared to Normal Lung Epithelial Cells.', 'Targeting the androgen receptor with steroid conjugates.', 'Selectively targeting prostate cancer with antiandrogen equipped histone deacetylase inhibitors.']"""

This study aims to assess whether plasma osteopontin was a biomarker of increasing progression within prostate cancer (PCa) prognostic groups and whether it reflected treatment response to local and systemic therapies.  Methods:   Baseline OPN was determined in men with localised (n=199), locally recurrent (n=9) and castrate-resistant, metastatic PCa (CRPC-MET; n=37). Receiver-operating curves (ROC) were generated to describe the accuracy of OPN for distinguishing between localised risk groups or localised vs metastatic disease. We also measured OPN pre- and posttreatment, following radical prostatectomy, external beam radiotherapy (EBRT), androgen deprivation (AD) or taxane-based chemotherapy.  Results:   The CRPC-MET patients had increased baseline values (mean 219; 56-513 ng ml(-1); P<0.0001) compared with the localised, non-metastatic group (mean 72; 12-438 ng ml(-1)). The area under the ROC to differentiate localised vs metastatic disease was improved when OPN was added to prostate-specific antigen (PSA) (0.943-0.969). Osteopontin neither distinguished high-risk PCa from other localised PCa nor correlated with serum PSA at baseline. Osteopontin levels reduced in low-risk patients after radical prostatectomy (P=0.005) and in CRPC-MET patients after chemotherapy (P=0.027), but not after EBRT or AD.

Overall survival, disease progression, and serious adverse events did not differ significantly between groups. This analysis assessed the cost-effectiveness of denosumab vs zoledronic acid in bone-metastatic prostate cancer from a US payer perspective.  Methods:   A literature-based Markov model, wherein inputs were selected to reproduce clinical trial outcomes, was developed to estimate the survival, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), number and costs of SREs, and drug and administration costs for patients receiving denosumab or zoledronic acid over 27 months. QALYs were estimated by assigning health-state utilities. SRE-related costs and utilities were literature-based. Outcomes were discounted 3% per annum, and model robustness was tested via scenario, univariate, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses.  Results:   Denosumab resulted in fewer estimated SREs (-0.241; 1.036 vs 1.277), more QALYs (0.0074; 0.9306 vs 0.9232), and lower SRE-related costs (-$2340; $8824 vs $11,164), but higher drug-related costs ($10,181; $23,144 vs $12,963) and total costs ($7841; $31,968 vs $24,127) vs zoledronic acid. The base case estimated cost per QALY-gained was $1,058,741.  Conclusion:   This analysis was limited by the restricted availability of clinical data and the need to use projection methods beyond the trial time frame.

To determine the specificity of VCP, serum levels were also measured in ovarian carcinoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and breast, colon, pancreatic, lung, and prostate cancer patients. Increased serum VCP levels were observed in the majority of cancer cases, with the exception of patients with lung or prostate cancer. Moreover, serum VCP levels were increased in some GCT, ovarian carcinoma, breast cancer, and colon cancer patients who did not otherwise display increased levels of widely used serum tumor markers for their cancer type (e.g. inhibin A, inhibin B, CA125, CEA, or CA15.3).

A possible barrier to biomarker discovery may be the polyclonal/multifocal nature of prostate tumors as well as cell-type heterogeneity between patient samples. Tumor-adjacent stroma (tumor microenvironment) is less affected by genetic alteration and might therefore yield more consistent biomarkers in response to tumor aggressiveness. To this end we compared Affymetrix gene expression profiles in stroma near tumor and identified a set of 115 probe sets for which the expression levels were significantly correlated with time-to-relapse. We also compared patients that chemically relapsed shortly after prostatectomy (<1 year), and patients that did not relapse in the first four years after prostatectomy. We identified 131 differentially expressed microarray probe sets between these two categories. 19 probe sets (15 genes overlapped between the two gene lists with p<0.0001). We developed a PAM-based classifier by training on samples containing stroma near tumor: 9 rapid relapse patient samples and 9 indolent patient samples. We then tested the classifier on 47 different samples, containing 90% or more stroma. The classifier predicted the risk status of patients with an average accuracy of 87%.

However, the biological significance of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and bone marrow derived extracellular matrix (BM-ECM) in this process is not fully understood. We therefore established an in vitro engineered bone marrow tissue model that incorporates hMSCs and BM-ECM to facilitate mechanistic studies of prostate cancer cell survival in androgen-depleted media in response to paracrine factors and BM-ECM. hMSC-derived paracrine factors increased LNCaP cell survival, which was in part attributed to IGFR and IL6 signaling. In addition, BM-ECM increased LNCaP and MDA-PCa-2b cell survival in androgen-depleted conditions, and induced chemoresistance and morphological changes in LNCaPs. To determine the effect of BM-ECM on cell signaling, the phosphorylation status of 46 kinases was examined. Increases in the phosphorylation of MAPK pathway-related proteins as well as sustained Akt phosphorylation were observed in BM-ECM cultures when compared to cultures grown on plasma-treated polystyrene. Blocking MEK1/2 or the PI3K pathway led to a significant reduction in LNCaP survival when cultured on BM-ECM in androgen-depleted conditions. The clinical relevance of these observations was determined by analyzing Erk phosphorylation in human bone metastatic prostate cancer versus non-metastatic prostate cancer, and increased phosphorylation was seen in the metastatic samples.

The MIBC with simultaneous renal pathology (carcinoma, loss of function) can be a reason for an RC in combination with a nephrectomy. In the present paper we give a report about our first 3 patients in whom we combined the robotic RC with a laparoscopic nephrectomy as a minimally invasive treatment.  Patients and methods:   Between January and September 2010 3 male patients (average age 66 years) with MIBC and an associated renal pathology (2×loss of function, 1×upper tract carcinoma) were treated by the simultaneous robot-assisted RC and laparoscopic nephrectomy at our hospital. Clinical and pathological criteria, surgical techniques and preoperative complications were recorded prospectively. Follow-up of the 3 patients continued for at least of 18 months.  Results:   In all 3 cases primarily the kidney was prepared in a transperitoneal-laparoscopic way and clipped by the vessel pedicle, then the robot-assisted RC followed and specimens were removed through a 10-cm median laparotomy. In all cases an ileum conduit was built extracorporally in using this way. The median OP time (including nephrectomy, connection of Da-Vinci, RC with extended lymph node dissection) amounted to 7 h (6.5-7.5 h) in total. The intraoperative blood loss was 330 mL on average. One of our patients showed a grade 2 complication following the Clavien-Dindo classification (1×grade 1, 1×without perioperative complications). On average 32 (22-46) lymph nodes were taken out, whereby all patients showed a pN0 status. The pathological stagings of MIBC were pT3a, pT4a and pT4b. With one patient the cancer of the renal pelvis was limited to the lamina propria, with another patient an incidental prostate cancer was detected. All histopathological findings of the different cancers showed negative surgical margins. The median hospitalisation time was 17 (16-19) days. In an 18- to 26-month follow-up period all patients ­remained without any further postoperative complications and ­without a tumour relapse.  Conclusion:   In this paper we have described the surgical steps of a small series of simultaneous robot-assisted RC and laparoscopic nephrectomy as a minimally invasive treatment in case of a specific indication. As a result of our report, we show that this surgical technique is possible without essential perioperative morbidity and with satisfying oncological results. Long-term data of our patients and results of any further studies are crucial to evaluate the efficiency of this complex surgical method.""","""['J Peter', 'M May', 'A M Ahmed', 'A Ahmed', 'C Gilfrich']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Aktuelle Urol""","""['Robot-assisted nerve-sparing radical cystectomy with bilateral extended pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND) and intracorporeal urinary diversion for bladder cancer: initial experience in 27 cases.', 'Robotic and laparoscopic high extended pelvic lymph node dissection during radical cystectomy: technique and outcomes.', 'Robotic extended pelvic lymphadenectomy for bladder cancer with increased nodal yield.', 'The role of laparoscopic and robotic cystectomy in the management of muscle-invasive bladder cancer with special emphasis on cancer control and complications.', 'Robot-assisted pelvic lymphadenectomy for bladder cancer--where have we reached by 2009.', 'Simultaneous laparoscopic nephroureterectomy and robot-assisted radical cystectomy: Lessons learned from our initial experience.', 'Surgical benchmarks, mid-term\xa0oncological outcomes, and impact of surgical team composition on simultaneous enbloc robot-assisted radical cystectomy and nephroureterectomy.', 'Outcomes and Complications of Simultaneous Laparoscopic Cystectomy and Laparoscopic Nephroureterectomy with Umbilical Reduced Port Surgery.', 'Simultaneous en-bloc robot-assisted radical cystectomy and nephro-ureterectomy: technique description, outcomes, and literature summary.']"""

Here we show in prostate cancer that miRNA-205 (miR-205) transcription is commonly repressed and the MIR-205 locus is hypermethylated. LOC642587, the MIR-205 host gene of unknown function, is also concordantly inactivated. We show that miR-205 targets mediator 1 (MED1, also called TRAP220 and PPARBP) for transcriptional silencing in normal prostate cells, leading to reduction in MED1 mRNA levels, and in total and active phospho-MED1 protein. Overexpression of miR-205 in prostate cancer cells negatively affects cell viability, consistent with a tumor suppressor function. We found that hypermethylation of the MIR-205 locus was strongly related with a decrease in miR-205 expression and an increase in MED1 expression in primary tumor samples (n=14), when compared with matched normal prostate (n=7). An expanded patient cohort (tumor n=149, matched normal n=30) also showed significant MIR-205 DNA methylation in tumors compared with normal, and MIR-205 hypermethylation is significantly associated with biochemical recurrence (hazard ratio=2.005, 95% confidence interval (1.109, 3.625), P=0.02), in patients with low preoperative prostate specific antigen.

Methods:   BALB/c nude mice were injected with human androgen-dependent prostate cancer cell line (LNCaP) and divided into two groups: castration and non-castration. Then the LNCaP-bearing mice were treated with sunitinib (40 mg/kg daily, 0.2 ml p.o. for 3 weeks). Both groups were paired with control groups in which the mice were given water by gavaging daily. The kidneys, livers, hearts, lungs, spleens, stomachs, intestines, skins, and other parts of all the mice were observed carefully during the study.  Results:   At the end of the 3-week dosing schedule, the tumors of the sunitinib-treated mice grew significantly slower than those of control group. Adverse reactions were not significantly found in the mice. We examined the impact of sunitinib on tumor growth and tumor angiogenesis through molecular factors representative of vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR-2) and platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFR-β) families, and of apoptosis (Bcl-2), and of proliferation (Ki67). The Ki67 and Von Willebrand factor expression of the control group was higher than that of the treated group. However, there was no significant difference observed between treated and control groups for apoptosis induction (Bcl-2). Immunohistochemistry, Western blot, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction results showed both VEGFR-2 and PDGFR-β expression in the control group was higher than that of the sunitinib-treated group.  Conclusion:   Sunitinib is safe and effective for treating tumors in the course form non-castration to castration groups in LNCaP xenograft prostate tumors.

Alternative treatment strategies to cytotoxic therapy should be explored. There is evidence that the continuous administration of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2) inhibitors and the immunomodulatory agents thalidomide or lenalidomide can result in longterm disease stabilization.

Whether these patients need to remain on ADT has not been well studied. We conducted a multicenter randomized trial to compare an intermittent versus continuous approach to ADT in CRPCa patients. Overall survival, health-related quality of life (QOL), and cost were the main endpoints.  Methods:   CRPCa patients were randomized 2:1 to intermittent or continuous luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonists (LHRHa). Patients were followed with clinical assessments, laboratory investigations, and QOL questionnaires (EORTC QLQ-C30 or PROSQOLI) every 2 months. If the serum testosterone rose above castrate levels (1.75 nmol/L), LHRHa were reinitiated. The study was designed to close if >50% of patients needed to restart ADT in the intermittent arm.  Results:   Thirty-one patients were followed with a median follow-up of 26.8 months-18 in the intermittent arm and 13 in the continuous. Twelve of 18 patients on the intermittent arm were reinitiated on LHRHa at a median time of 17.9 months. There was no difference in overall or cancer-specific survival between the 2 arms. There was no statistically significant difference in QOL between the 2 arms at 0 and 12 months. The total mean costs at 24 months were significantly lower in the intermittent arm ($3135 vs. $8253 Canadian dollars, P=0.0167) compared with the continuous. The main limitation of this study is the small sample size.

Methods:   We analyzed data from 75 couples in the Family and Cancer Therapy Selection study. Paired patients and family members were independently asked about their willingness to pay (WTP) for a hypothetical new treatment that cures prostate cancer without side effects if they could reconsider their treatment decision by indicating the maximum amount they would be willing to pay given 11 separate ""bids"" ranging from $0 to $1500 per month. Descriptive and regression analyses were conducted for patients and family members controlling for sociodemographic characteristics and health status; Spearman correlations were also examined.  Results:   Among 75 couples analyzed, the income-adjusted mean WTP estimates per month were $400.8 (standard error [SE] $54.3) for patients and $650.2 (SE 72.2) for family members.

Here we have developed a nanoplex platform for theranostic imaging of prostate cancer (PCa). In these proof-of-principle studies, a therapeutic nanoplex containing multimodal imaging reporters was targeted to prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), which is expressed on the cell surface of castrate-resistant PCa. The nanoplex was designed to deliver small interfering RNA (siRNA) along with a prodrug enzyme to PSMA-expressing tumors. Each component of the nanoplex was carefully selected to evaluate its diagnostic aspect of PSMA imaging and its therapeutic aspects of siRNA-mediated down-regulation of a target gene and the conversion of a prodrug to cytotoxic drug, using noninvasive multimodality imaging. Studies performed using two variants of human PC3-PCa cells and tumors, one with high PSMA expression level and another with negligible expression levels, demonstrated PSMA-specific uptake. In addition, down-regulation of the selected siRNA target, choline kinase (Chk), and the conversion of the nontoxic prodrug 5-fluorocytosine (5-FC) to cytotoxic 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) were also demonstrated with noninvasive imaging. The nanoplex was well-tolerated and did not induce liver or kidney toxicity or a significant immune response.

Epidemiological and clinical trials rarely provide evidence for mechanisms of the compound's action, and studies on its effect on cancer of different cell origins are now being done. The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of lycopene on cell cycle and cell viability in eight human cancer cell lines.  Methods:   Human cell lines were treated with lycopene (1-5 μM) for 48 and 96 h. Cell viability was monitored using the method of MTT. The cell cycle was analyzed by flow cytometry, and apoptotic cells were identified by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick labeling (TUNEL) and by DAPI.  Results:   Our data showed a significant decrease in the number of viable cells in three cancer cells lines (HT-29, T84 and MCF-7) after 48 h treatment with lycopene, and changes in the fraction of cells retained in different cell cycle phases. Lycopene promoted also cell cycle arrest followed by decreased cell viability in majority of cell lines after 96 h, as compared to controls. Furthermore, an increase in apoptosis was observed in four cell lines (T-84, HT-29, MCF-7 and DU145) when cells were treated with lycopene.  Conclusions:   Our findings show the capacity of lycopene to inhibit cell proliferation, arrest cell cycle in different phases and increase apoptosis, mainly in breast, colon and prostate lines after 96 h. These observations suggest that lycopene may alter cell cycle regulatory proteins depending on the type of cancer and the dose of lycopene administration.

However, only a few studies have investigated the association between IGF-1 levels and childhood cancer risk. We aimed to compare the IGF-1 serum level in children with de novo malignancies to healthy children, and to assess its relationship with cancer type, stage, metastasis and different disease characteristics. The study was carried out on 100 children; 50 children with de novo malignancies and 50 healthy children of matched age and gender as a control group. The patients were subjected to a routine work-up for their cancers according to our local standards. Estimation of the serum level of IGF-1 was carried out in the two groups using ELISA. Our results showed that children with cancer had significantly higher levels of IGF-1 than healthy controls of the same age and gender. No association was found between IGF-1 and tumor type, stage, metastasis and other disease characteristics. In conclusion, the IGF-1 serum level is an important indicator of risk for the most prevalent forms of childhood cancer. It may be used to identify children at the highest risk for these cancers and aid in determing who may benefit most from preventive strategies.

However, some of the hybrids survived to form colonies from the co-culture with cancer-associated stromal cells. These derivative clones showed genomic alterations together with androgen-independent phenotype. The results from this study reveal that prostate cancer cells are fusogenic, and cancer-stromal interaction can lead to spontaneous fusion between the two cell types. While a cancer-stromal fusion strategy may allow the stromal compartment to annihilate invading cancer cells, certain cancer-stromal hybrids with increased survival capability may escape annihilation to form a derivative cancer cell population with an altered genotype and increased malignancy. Cancer-stromal fusion thus lays a foundation for an incessant co-evolution between cancer and the cancer-associated stromal cells in the tumor microenvironment.""","""['Ruoxiang Wang', 'Xiaojuan Sun', 'Christopher Y Wang', 'Peizhen Hu', 'Chia-Yi Chu', 'Shurong Liu', 'Haiyen E Zhau', 'Leland W K Chung']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Cancer-stromal cell fusion as revealed by fluorescence protein tracking.', 'Androgen deprivation induces selective outgrowth of aggressive hormone-refractory prostate cancer clones expressing distinct cellular and molecular properties not present in parental androgen-dependent cancer cells.', 'Matched pairs of human prostate stromal cells display differential tropic effects on LNCaP prostate cancer cells.', 'Molecular insights into prostate cancer progression: the missing link of tumor microenvironment.', 'Three-dimensional co-culture models to study prostate cancer growth, progression, and metastasis to bone.', 'Breast Cancer MCF-7 Cells Acquire Heterogeneity during Successive Co-Culture with Hematopoietic and Bone Marrow-Derived Mesenchymal Stem/Stromal Cells.', 'Generation of Cancer Stem/Initiating Cells by Cell-Cell Fusion.', 'Hybrid/Atypical Forms of Circulating Tumor Cells: Current State of the Art.', 'Tumor Hybrid Cells: Nature and Biological Significance.', 'Cancer Cell Fusion and Post-Hybrid Selection Process (PHSP).']"""

One of the best enrichment schemes for isolating the putative stem/progenitor cell from the murine prostate gland is Lin(-);Sca1(+);CD49f(hi) (LSC(hi)), which results in a more than 10-fold enrichment for in vitro sphere-forming activity. We have shown previously that the LSC(hi) subpopulation is both necessary and sufficient for cancer initiation in the Pten-null prostate cancer model. To further improve this enrichment scheme, we searched for cell surface molecules upregulated upon castration of murine prostate and identified CD166 as a candidate gene. CD166 encodes a cell surface molecule that can further enrich sphere-forming activity of WT LSC(hi) and Pten null LSC(hi). Importantly, CD166 could enrich sphere-forming ability of benign primary human prostate cells in vitro and induce the formation of tubule-like structures in vivo. CD166 expression is upregulated in human prostate cancers, especially CRPC samples. Although genetic deletion of murine CD166 in the Pten null prostate cancer model does not interfere with sphere formation or block prostate cancer progression and CRPC development, the presence of CD166 on prostate stem/progenitors and castration resistant sub-populations suggest that it is a cell surface molecule with the potential for targeted delivery of human prostate cancer therapeutics.""","""['Jing Jiao', 'Antreas Hindoyan', 'Shunyou Wang', 'Linh M Tran', 'Andrew S Goldstein', 'Devon Lawson', 'Donghui Chen', 'Yunfeng Li', 'Changyong Guo', 'Baohui Zhang', 'Ladan Fazli', 'Martin Gleave', 'Owen N Witte', 'Isla P Garraway', 'Hong Wu']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['A rare castration-resistant progenitor cell population is highly enriched in Pten-null prostate tumours.', 'Lin-Sca-1+CD49fhigh stem/progenitors are tumor-initiating cells in the Pten-null prostate cancer model.', 'Characterizing the contribution of stem/progenitor cells to tumorigenesis in the Pten-/-TP53-/- prostate cancer model.', 'New insights into prostate cancer stem cells.', 'Prostate cancer stem cells: deciphering the origins and pathways involved in prostate tumorigenesis and aggression.', 'Innate Immune Program in Formation of Tumor-Initiating Cells from Cells-of-Origin of Breast, Prostate, and Ovarian Cancers.', 'Cancer Stemness/Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition Axis Influences Metastasis and Castration Resistance in Prostate Cancer: Potential Therapeutic Target.', 'Prostate Cancer Stem Cells: The Role of CD133.', 'Prostate Cancer Stem Cells: Clinical Aspects and Targeted Therapies.', 'Cancer Stem Cells: From an Insight into the Basics to Recent Advances and Therapeutic Targeting.']"""

In adult prostate, stromal-epithelial interactions are important for tissue homeostasis and also play a significant role in prostate cancer. In this study we have identified molecules that show a mesenchymal expression pattern in the developing prostate, and one of these showed reduced expression in prostate cancer stroma.  Methodology and principal findings:   Five candidate molecules identified by transcript profiling of developmental prostate mesenchyme were selected using a wholemount in situ hybridisation screen and studied Decorin (Dcn), Semaphorin6D (Sema6D), SPARC/Osteonectin (SPARC), Sprouty1 (Spry-1) and Tsukushi (Tsku). Expression in rat tissues was evaluated using wholemount in situ hybridisation (postnatal day (P) 0.5) and immunohistochemistry (embryonic day (E) E17.5, E19.5; P0.5; P6; 28 & adult). Four candidates (Decorin, SPARC, Spry-1, Tsukushi) were immunolocalised in human foetal prostate (weeks 14, 16, 19) and expression of Decorin was evaluated on a human prostate cancer tissue microarray. In embryonic and perinatal rats Decorin, Semaphorin6D, SPARC, Spry-1 and Tsukushi were expressed with varying distribution patterns throughout the mesenchyme at E17.5, E19.5, P0.5 and P6.5. In P28 and adult prostates there was either a decrease in the expression (Semaphorin6D) or a switch to epithelial expression of SPARC, and Spry-1, whereas Decorin and Tsukushi were specific to mesenchyme/stroma at all ages. Expression of Decorin, SPARC, Spry-1 and Tsukushi in human foetal prostates paralleled that in rat. Decorin showed mesenchymal and stromal-specific expression at all ages and was further examined in prostate cancer, where stromal expression was significantly reduced compared with non-malignant prostate.  Conclusion and significance:   We describe the spatio-temporal expression of Decorin, Semaphorin6D, SPARC, Spry-1 and Tsukushi in developing prostate and observed similar mesenchymal expression patterns in rat and human.

The expression of FOXA1 was higher in PC than in normal prostate tissues (P = 0.0002), and, using immunohistochemical analysis, we found that FOXA1 was localized in the nucleus. FOXA1 expression levels were significantly correlated with both PSA and Gleason scores (P = 0.016 and P = 0.031, respectively). Moreover, FOXA1 up-regulation was a significant factor in PSA failure (P = 0.011). Depletion of FOXA1 in a prostate cancer cell line (LNCaP) using small interfering RNA (siRNA) significantly inhibited AR activity, led to cell-growth suppression, and induced G0/G1 arrest.

More, hormone therapies induce crucial biological changes involving androgen receptors; some might be targets for escape prevention. We investigated the relationship between the androgen deprivation treatment and the risk of recurrence using nude mice bearing the high grade, hormone-dependent human prostate cancer xenograft PAC120. Tumor-bearing mice were treated by Luteinizing-Hormone Releasing Hormone (LHRH) antagonist alone, continuous or intermittent regimen, or combined with androgen receptor (AR) antagonists (bicalutamide or flutamide). Tumor growth was monitored. Biological changes were studied as for genomic alterations, AR mutations and protein expression in a large series of recurrent tumors according to hormone therapy modalities. Therapies targeting Her-2 or AKT were tested in combination with castration. All statistical tests were two-sided. Tumor growth was inhibited by continuous administration of the LH-RH antagonist degarelix (castration), but 40% of tumors recurred. Intermittent castration or complete blockade induced by degarelix and antiandrogens combination, inhibited tumor growth but increased the risk of recurrence (RR) as compared to continuous castration (RR(intermittent): 14.5, RR(complete blockade): 6.5 and 1.35). All recurrent tumors displayed new quantitative genetic alterations and AR mutations, whatever the treatment modalities. AR amplification was found after complete blockade. Increased expression of Her-2/neu with frequent ERK/AKT activation was detected in all variants. Combination of castration with a Her-2/neu inhibitor decreased recurrence risk (0.17) and combination with an mTOR inhibitor prevented it. Anti-hormone treatments influence risk of recurrence although tumor growth inhibition was initially similar. Recurrent tumors displayed genetic instability, AR mutations, and alterations of phosphorylation pathways.

Hypothesis:   Cancer-specific concerns will be reduced throughout a 10-month diet and exercise intervention among recently diagnosed cancer survivors. Additionally, participants reporting greater levels of PA will also report fewer cancer-specific concerns.  Study design:   This study is an exploratory analysis of 452 recently diagnosed, early-stage breast and prostate cancer survivors who participated in the FRESH START diet and exercise trial. Data were collected at baseline and 1-year follow-up.  Results:   At baseline, chief concerns among prostate cancer survivors included ability to have an erection (mean score [standard deviation] = 1.0 [1.3]) and urinary frequency (2.5 [1.4]), whereas among breast cancer survivors, eminent concerns were not feeling sexually attractive (2.0 [1.3]) and worry about cancer in other members of their family (2.1 [1.3]). At 1 year, there was a significant improvement in cancer-specific concerns on breast cancer-specific concerns (P < .01) but not on prostate cancer-specific concerns. At baseline, women who were self-conscious about their dress had higher levels of PA, whereas men reporting issues with incontinence reported lesser increases in PA in response to the intervention.  Conclusion:   Cancer-specific concerns diminish over time, especially among breast cancer survivors. Among prostate cancer survivors, incontinence is a significant barrier that hinders benefit from PA interventions.

In this region, genetic variants of the class A scavenger receptor (SR-A) gene have been associated with prostate cancer risk and have been highlighted as a potential susceptibility gene of cancer.  Objectives:   To determine whether common polymorphisms in the SR-A gene are associated with human lung cancer risk and to clarify the role of SR-A in lung carcinogenesis.  Methods:   The relationship of three potentially functional polymorphisms (T-365C, T+25C, and Ala275Pro) in the SR-A gene with lung cancer risk was evaluated in 1287 lung cancer case subjects and 1261 control subjects from the Chinese population. At the same time, SR-A null mice were used to investigate its role in lung cancer development.  Measurements and main results:   The T+25C polymorphism was independently associated with lung cancer risk and significantly correlated with decreased expression of SR-A. The decreased SR-A expression was also found in tumor tissues as compared with normal tissues. Depletion of SR-A boosted the growth and angiogenesis of implanted Lewis lung carcinoma in mice. The cancer-suppressing capability of SR-A was attributable to its expression in bone marrow-derived cells as evidenced by bone marrow transplantation. Further analysis revealed augmented expression of proangiogenic factors including matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9) in SR-A-deficient mice, indicative of a more procarcinogenic microenvironment. Last, zoledronate, an MMP9 inhibitor, abrogated acceleration of tumor growth conferred by SR-A loss-of-function.

We present results on the in vitro antitumor activity of an organometallic 'Ru(II)Cp' complex, [Ru(II)Cp(bipy)(PPh(3))][CF(3)SO(3)], designated as TM34 (PPh(3) = triphenylphosphine; bipy = 2,2'-bipyridine), against a panel of human tumor cell lines with different responses to cisplatin treatment, namely ovarian (A2780/A2780cisR, cisplatin sensitive and resistant, respectively), breast (MCF7) and prostate (PC3) adenocarcinomas. TM34 is very active against all tumorigenic cell lines, its efficacy largely surpassing that of cisplatin (CisPt). The high activity of TM34 towards CisPt resistant cell lines possibly suggests a mechanism of action distinct from that of CisPt. The effect of TM34 on the activity of the enzyme poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP-1) involved in DNA repair mechanisms and apoptotic pathways was also evaluated, and it was found to be a strong PARP-1 ruthenium inhibitor in the low micromolar range (IC(50)=1.0 ± 0.3 μM). TM34 quickly binds to human serum albumin forming a 1:1 complex with a conditional stability constant (log K'~4.0), comparable to that of the Ru(III) complex in clinical trial KP1019. This indicates that TM34 can be efficiently transported by this protein, possibly being involved in its distribution and delivery if the complex is introduced in the blood stream. Albumin binding does not affect TM34 activity, yielding an adduct that maintains cytotoxic properties (against A2780 and A2780cisR cells). Altogether, the properties herein evaluated suggest that TM34 could be an anticancer agent of highly relevant therapeutic value.""","""['Ana Isabel Tomaz', 'Tamás Jakusch', 'Tânia S Morais', 'Fernanda Marques', 'Rodrigo F M de Almeida', 'Filipa Mendes', 'Eva A Enyedy', 'Isabel Santos', 'João Costa Pessoa', 'Tamás Kiss', 'M Helena Garcia']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""J Inorg Biochem""","""['New water-soluble ruthenium(II) cytotoxic complex: biological activity and cellular distribution.', 'Biological activity and cellular uptake of Ru(η5-C5H5)(PPh3)(Me2bpy)CF3SO3 complex.', 'Screening organometallic binuclear thiosemicarbazone ruthenium complexes as potential anti-tumour agents: cytotoxic activity and human serum albumin binding mechanism.', 'DNA binding mode of ruthenium complexes and relationship to tumor cell toxicity.', 'Recent developments in ruthenium anticancer drugs.', 'Biotinylated Polymer-Ruthenium Conjugates: In Vitro and In Vivo Studies in a Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Model.', 'Ruthenium(II)-Cyclopentadienyl-Derived Complexes as New Emerging Anti-Colorectal Cancer Drugs.', 'Lipid Status of A2780 Ovarian Cancer Cells after Treatment with Ruthenium Complex Modified with Carbon Dot Nanocarriers: A Multimodal SR-FTIR Spectroscopy and MALDI TOF Mass Spectrometry Study.', 'Ultrasonication Improves Solid Phase Synthesis of Peptides Specific for Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor and for the Protein-Protein Interface RANK-TRAF6.', 'Combining PARP Inhibition with Platinum, Ruthenium or Gold Complexes for Cancer Therapy.']"""

Furthermore, force exertion and measurement can be difficult for some internal organs, making boundary forces another missing parameter. We propose a general method for estimating elasticity and boundary forces automatically using an iterative optimization framework, given the desired (target) output surface. During the optimization, the input model is deformed by the simulator, and an objective function based on the distance between the deformed surface and the target surface is minimized numerically. The optimization framework does not depend on a particular simulation method and is therefore suitable for different physical models. We show a positive correlation between clinical prostate cancer stage (a clinical measure of severity) and the recovered elasticity of the organ.

The automated segmentation of livers is addressed first. A novel 3-D affine invariant shape parameterization is employed to compare local shape across organs. By generating a regular sampling of the organ's surface, this parameterization can be effectively used to compare features of a set of closed 3-D surfaces point-to-point, while avoiding common problems with the parameterization of concave surfaces. From an initial segmentation of the livers, the areas of atypical local shape are determined using training sets. A geodesic active contour corrects locally the segmentations of the livers in abnormal images. Graph cuts segment the hepatic tumors using shape and enhancement constraints. Liver segmentation errors are reduced significantly and all tumors are detected. Finally, support vector machines and feature selection are employed to reduce the number of false tumor detections. The tumor detection true position fraction of 100% is achieved at 2.3 false positives/case and the tumor burden is estimated with 0.9% error.

However, a possible increase in high-grade disease has raised concerns that the harms of the drugs, including mortality because of high-grade disease, may outweigh the benefits. The authors attempted to estimate the effect of these drugs on prostate cancer mortality to be able to better evaluate the cost-benefit tradeoff.  Methods:   The authors analyzed prostate cancer incidence in the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) and Reduction by Dutasteride of Prostate Cancer Events (REDUCE) trial, which evaluated finasteride and the related compound dutasteride, respectively (both vs placebo). They used 13-year prostate cancer survival data from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) trial to project prostate cancer mortality from incidence patterns; survival rates were applied to incident cancers according to prognostic strata, which were defined by Gleason score, prostate-specific antigen level, and clinical stage. For PCPT, the analysis was performed using both original trial results and previously published adjusted analyses that attempted to account for artifacts related to the drugs' effect on prostate volume.  Results:   For the PCPT trial, the estimated relative risk (RR) for prostate cancer mortality was 1.02 (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.85-1.23) using the original trial results and 0.87 (95% CI, 0.72-1.06) and 0.91 (95% CI, 0.76-1.09) based on the adjusted PCPT analyses. For the REDUCE trial, the RR for prostate cancer mortality was 0.93 (95% CI, 0.80-1.08).

In order to understand mechanisms of action of Hsp27 and find new therapeutic targets specific of CRPC, we screened for Hsp27 client proteins. Here, we report that translationally controlled tumor protein (TCTP) is a new Hsp27 client protein involved in Hsp27 cytoprotection. We found that TCTP expression is absent or weak in normal prostate cells, moderately expressed in 18.5% of treatment naive PC, and becomes uniformly and strongly expressed in 75% of CRPC. To define TCTP function, we developed and worldwide patented a TCTP antisense oligonucleotide (ASO). Interestingly, we found that CRPC progression correlates with TCTP overexpression and loss of P53. TCTP knockdown restored P53 expression and function, suggesting that castration-sensitivity is directly linked to P53 expression. Collectively, these findings provide a new Hsp27 cytoprotection mechanism in CRPC, and preclinical proof-of-concept that combining ASO-mediated TCTP knockdown with castration and/or docetaxel therapy could serve as a novel strategy to treat CRPC, with no or little toxicity for normal prostate cells.""","""['Virginie Baylot', 'Maria Katsogiannou', 'Claudia Andrieu', 'David Taieb', 'Julie Acunzo', 'Sophie Giusiano', 'Ladan Fazli', 'Martin Gleave', 'Carmen Garrido', 'Palma Rocchi']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Mol Ther""","""['DDX5 mRNA-targeting antisense oligonucleotide as a new promising therapeutic in combating castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'The functional landscape of Hsp27 reveals new cellular processes such as DNA repair and alternative splicing and proposes novel anticancer targets.', 'Lipid-oligonucleotide conjugates improve cellular uptake and efficiency of TCTP-antisense in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'TCTP Has a Crucial Role in the Different Stages of Prostate Cancer Malignant Progression.', 'The promise of heat shock protein inhibitors in the treatment of castration resistant prostate cancer.', 'ZNF703 mRNA-Targeting Antisense Oligonucleotide Blocks Cell Proliferation and Induces Apoptosis in Breast Cancer Cell Lines.', 'Structural transitions in TCTP tumor protein upon binding to the anti-apoptotic protein family member Mcl-1.', 'DDX5 mRNA-targeting antisense oligonucleotide as a new promising therapeutic in combating castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Translationally controlled tumor protein: the mediator promoting cancer invasion and migration and its potential clinical prospects.', 'SUMOylation of Translationally Regulated Tumor Protein Modulates Its Immune Function.']"""

Our aim was to examine Gal-3 expression in tumor, benign tissue adjacent to the tumor (adjacent-benign) and benign prostate specimens and correlated it with biochemical recurrence.  Materials and methods:   Tissue microarrays were prepared from 83 tumor, 78 adjacent-benign and 75 benign tissues obtained from 83 patients undergoing prostatectomy for clinically localized prostate cancer. Tissues were stained using a Gal-3 antibody and immunohistochemistry. The staining was graded between 0 and 300 depending upon staining intensity and the area of staining. In 37 patients on whom there was follow-up (Mean: 57.8 months; Median: 68 months), staining intensity was correlated with biochemical recurrence.  Results:   Gal-3 showed both nuclear and cytoplasmic localization in benign, adjacent-benign and tumor tissues. Median Gal-3 staining scores significantly decreased from benign (192.5) to adjacent-benign (148.8 p = 0.007) and to tumor (108.8; p < 0.0001) tissues.

The first-order conditional estimation method with interaction was applied. Results The one-compartment model with one random effect on CL and two different proportional error models provided an adequate description of the data. Creatinine clearance (CLCR), cancer type, and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were recognized as significant covariates of CL. CLCR was the most influential covariate on sepantronium exposure and predicted to contribute to a 25 % decrease in CL for patients with moderately impaired renal function (CLCR = 40 mL/min) compared to patients with normal CLCR.

Using an exact merging method rather than the previously-used heuristic, we are able to better characterize the trade-off between the delivery efficiency and dose quality. VMERGE begins with a solution of the fluence-map optimization problem with 180 equi-spaced beams that yields the 'ideal' dose distribution. Neighboring fluence maps are then successively merged, meaning that they are added together and delivered as a single map. The merging process improves the delivery efficiency at the expense of deviating from the initial high-quality dose distribution. We replace the original merging heuristic by considering the merging problem as a discrete bi-criteria optimization problem with the objectives of maximizing the treatment efficiency and minimizing the deviation from the ideal dose. We formulate this using a network-flow model that represents the merging problem. Since the problem is discrete and thus non-convex, we employ a customized box algorithm to characterize the Pareto frontier. The Pareto frontier is then used as a benchmark to evaluate the performance of the standard VMERGE algorithm as well as two other similar heuristics. We test the exact and heuristic merging approaches on a pancreas and a prostate cancer case. For both cases, the shape of the Pareto frontier suggests that starting from a high-quality plan, we can obtain efficient VMAT plans through merging neighboring fluence maps without substantially deviating from the initial dose distribution. The trade-off curves obtained by the various heuristics are contrasted and shown to all be equally capable of initial plan simplifications, but to deviate in quality for more drastic efficiency improvements. This work presents a network optimization approach to the merging problem. Contrasting the trade-off curves of the merging heuristics against the Pareto approximation validates that heuristic approaches are capable of achieving high-quality merged plans that lie close to the Pareto frontier.""","""['Ehsan Salari', 'Jeremiah Wala', 'David Craft']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['SU-E-T-619: A Network-Flow Solution Approach to VMAT Treatment Plan Optimization.', 'Multicriteria VMAT optimization.', 'Optimal partial-arcs in VMAT treatment planning.', 'Weighting admission scores to balance predictiveness-diversity: The Pareto-optimization approach.', 'Neural optimization: Understanding trade-offs with Pareto theory.', 'Solving the volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) problem using a sequential convex programming method.', 'Automation in intensity modulated radiotherapy treatment planning-a review of recent innovations.', 'Optimization approaches to volumetric modulated arc therapy planning.', 'Simultaneous beam sampling and aperture shape optimization for SPORT.']"""

Recently, emphasis has been placed on active surveillance for selected men with favorable-risk PC to avoid unnecessary treatment for tumors that may be clinically insignificant. We performed a population-based analysis to assess patterns of initial treatment (IT) for a contemporary cohort of elderly men diagnosed with a favorable-risk PC in the United States.  Methods:   We used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database to identify men aged more than or equal to 70 years diagnosed with a favorable-risk PC from 2004 to 2008. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to determine patient, tumor, and socioeconomic factors associated with IT.  Results:   A total of 15,108 men more than or equal to 70 years with a favorable-risk PC were identified. Prostatectomy was performed in 2.6% of patients. Fifty-nine percent of patients were recommended to undergo radiation therapy (RT). Among patients 70 to 74 years, 66.45% were recommended to undergo RT. Fifty-nine percent, 36.6%, and 15.8% of patients between 75 and 79, 80 and 84, and more than or equal to 85 years were recommended to receive RT, respectively. Factors significantly associated with IT on multivariable logistic regression analysis included: younger age, white race, Gleason Score 6 (vs.≤5), married marital status, and no history of prior malignancy.

Methods:   National cancer registry data for England were used to estimate cancer prevalence in the United Kingdom in 2009. Using a model of prevalence as a function of incidence, survival and population demographics, projections were made to 2040. Different scenarios of future incidence and survival, and their effects on cancer prevalence, were also considered. Colorectal, lung, prostate, female breast and all cancers combined (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer) were analysed separately.  Results:   Assuming that existing trends in incidence and survival continue, the number of cancer survivors in the United Kingdom is projected to increase by approximately one million per decade from 2010 to 2040. Particularly large increases are anticipated in the oldest age groups, and in the number of long-term survivors. By 2040, almost a quarter of people aged at least 65 will be cancer survivors.

Materials and methods:   We performed a prospective study in men who underwent laparoscopic radical prostatectomy between September 2003 and November 2005 at our center and who received penile rehabilitation after surgery. All patients had antegrade interfascial dissection. They received 10 mg tadalafil on the fifth postoperative day and continued to receive it every other day, regardless of erectile function. Intracavernous injection of alprostadil was initiated at 3 or 6 months depending on response to treatment with tadalafil. Follow up evaluations were done at 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months. Oncologic and functional outcomes and compliance were assessed. Patients filled in International Index of Erectile Function-5 (IIEF-5) questionnaires.  Results:   Of 1078 men who underwent laparoscopic radical prostatectomy during this time, 586 patients met inclusion criteria, complied with the study medication, and had complete data for 24 months. The patients had a median preoperative baseline IIEF-5 score of 22. A total of 150 patients (26%) underwent unilateral nerve-sparing surgery, while 436 patients (74%) had bilateral nerve-sparing surgery. At 24 months, 35% of patients who underwent unilateral nerve-sparing surgery and 68% of patients who underwent bilateral nerve-sparing surgery reported having sufficient erectile function for intercourse without using intracavernous injection of alprostadil.

In spite of its low specificity, PSA is the most widely used screening test for prostate cancer (PCa), and is considered the main cause of the stage migration recently observed. The ratio of free to total PSA (%fPSA) has been shown to increase PSA accuracy in cancer detection; however, few screening studies have systematically evaluated its role in cancer detection rates in men with PSA levels <4.0 ng/mL and normal DRE. The present study supports a possible role of %fPSA as an adjunct to screening in men with total PSA 2.5-4.0 ng/mL and normal DRE, with a marked increase in cancer detection rates in a large Brazilian PCa screening study. We believe that %fPSA maybe a useful refinement to biopsy indications in men with low PSA levels.  Objective:   • To evaluate the role of the free to total prostate-specific antigen ratio (%fPSA) in identifying prostate cancer (PCa) in men with a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level of 2.5-3.9 ng/mL and a normal digital rectal examination (DRE).  Patients and methods:   • A prospective PCa screening study was conducted, which included 17571 men aged ≥ 45 years, across six Brazilian states, where men were recalled for further evaluation in the case of either a suspicious DRE and/or PSA ≥ 4.0 ng/mL, or PSA 2.5-3.9 ng/mL and %fPSA ≤ 15. • We evaluated the impact of a %fPSA ≤ 15 on cancer detection rates and the clinical and pathological stage of tumours in men with a normal DRE and PSA 2.5-3.9 ng/mL.  Results:   • When suspicious DRE and/or PSA ≥ 4.0 ng/mL were considered as criteria to prompt further evaluation, the cancer detection rate was 3.1%. When %fPSA ≤ 15 in men with total PSA levels of 2.5-3.9 ng/mL were considered as criteria, the PCa detection rate increased to 3.7%. Considering %fPSA ≤ 15 in men with PSA 2.5-3.9 ng/mL and normal DRE, the positive predictive value of biopsy was 31.1%. • Clinical stage was more favourable among men with PSA 2.5-3.9 ng/mL, normal DRE, and %fPSA ≤ 15 compared with men with normal DRE and PSA ≥ 4.0 ng/mL (P= 0.02). • Among those who underwent radical prostatectomy, pathological stage and the proportion of insignificant tumours were similar between men with PSA 2.5-3.9 ng/mL, normal DRE findings and %fPSA ≤ 15, and men with PSA ≥ 4.0 ng/mL.  Conclusions:   • The use of %fPSA ≤ 15 as a biopsy indication in men with normal DRE and PSA 2.5-4.0 ng/mL in a PCa screening programme, increased cancer detection rates. Tumours in this subset of patients had similar pathological characteristics. • Using %fPSA ≤ 15 to indicate biopsy in men with PSA 2.5-3.9 ng/mL is a useful adjunct to PCa screening.""","""['Eliney Ferreira Faria', 'Gustavo F Carvalhal', 'Rodolfo Borges dos Reis', 'Marcos Tobias-Machado', 'Renê A C Vieira', 'Leonardo O Reis', 'Lucas Nogueira', 'Roberto Dias Machado', 'Celso H Freitas Jr', 'Wesley J Magnabosco', 'Edmundo C Mauad', 'André Lopes Carvalho']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Percent free PSA as an additional measure in a prostate cancer screen.', 'A comparative performance analysis of total prostate-specific antigen, percentage free prostate-specific antigen, prostate-specific antigen velocity and urinary prostate cancer gene 3 in the first, second and third repeat prostate biopsy.', 'Risk of repeat biopsy and prostate cancer detection after an initial extended negative biopsy: longitudinal follow-up from a prospective trial.', 'Screening for prostate cancer in 2008 II: the importance of molecular subforms of prostate-specific antigen and tissue kallikreins.', 'Early management of prostate cancer: how to respond to an elevated PSA?', 'Clinical application of free/total PSA ratio in the diagnosis of prostate cancer in men over 50 years of age with total PSA levels of 2.0-25.0 ng ml-1 in Western China.', 'Prostate cancer screening among elderly men in Brazil: should we diagnose or not?', 'Innovative Diagnostic Methods for Early Prostate Cancer Detection through Urine Analysis: A Review.', 'Digital Rectal Examination for Prostate Cancer Screening in Primary Care: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'The Hospital de Câncer de Barretos Registry: an analysis of cancer survival at a single institution in Brazil over a 10-year period.']"""

All methods demonstrated a slight improvement in predictive performance upon incorporation of genetics.

In addition to hormonal ligands, AR activity is regulated by posttranslational modifications. Here, we show that androgen induces SUMO-2 and SUMO-3 (SUMO-2/3) modification (SUMOylation) of the endogenous AR in prostate cancer cells, which is also reflected in the chromatin-bound receptor. Although only a small percentage of AR is SUMOylated at the steady state, AR SUMOylation sites have an impact on the receptor's stability, intranuclear mobility, and chromatin interactions and on expression of its target genes. Interestingly, short-term proteotoxic and cell stress, such as hyperthermia, that detaches the AR from the chromatin triggers accumulation of the SUMO-2/3-modified AR pool which concentrates into the nuclear matrix compartment. Alleviation of the stress allows rapid reversal of the SUMO-2/3 modifications and the AR to return to the chromatin. In sum, these results suggest that the androgen-induced SUMOylation is linked to the activity cycles of the holo-AR in the nucleus and chromatin binding, whereas the stress-induced SUMO-2/3 modifications sustain the solubility of the AR and protect it from proteotoxic insults in the nucleus.""","""['Miia Rytinki', 'Sanna Kaikkonen', 'Päivi Sutinen', 'Ville Paakinaho', 'Vesa Rahkama', 'Jorma J Palvimo']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Mol Cell Biol""","""['SUMO-specific protease 1 (SENP1) reverses the hormone-augmented SUMOylation of androgen receptor and modulates gene responses in prostate cancer cells.', 'Prostaglandin 15d-PGJ(2) inhibits androgen receptor signaling in prostate cancer cells.', 'SUMO3 modification by PIAS1 modulates androgen receptor cellular distribution and stability.', 'Ubiquitin-like protein modifications in prostate and breast cancer.', 'Posttranslational modification of the androgen receptor in prostate cancer.', 'Trisomy of Human Chromosome 21 Orthologs Mapping to Mouse Chromosome 10 Cause Age and Sex-Specific Learning Differences: Relevance to Down Syndrome.', 'Context Fear Conditioning in Down Syndrome Mouse Models: Effects of Trisomic Gene Content, Age, Sex and Genetic Background.', 'Post-Translational Modifications That Drive Prostate Cancer Progression.', 'SUMO and Transcriptional Regulation: The Lessons of Large-Scale Proteomic, Modifomic and Genomic Studies.', 'SUMOylation regulates the protein network and chromatin accessibility at glucocorticoid receptor-binding sites.']"""

Herein we evaluated the therapeutic activity of liposomes engineered to be responsive to different sPLA(2) isoforms compared to clinically used long-circulating (pegylated) sterically stabilized liposomes (SSL) in vitro and in vivo, and assessed differences in roles of sPLA(2) in the mechanism of uptake and delivery of these nanoparticles. Exposing sPLA(2) responsive liposomes (SPRL) to sPLA(2) increased the release of intraluminal entrapped contents in a time-dependent manner that was inhibited by the sPLA(2) inhibitor LY3117273. Treatment of prostate cancer cells with doxorubicin encapsulated in SSL and SPRL resulted in cytotoxicity in LNCaP, DU-145 and PC-3 cells lines comparable to free drug. Interestingly, cytotoxicity was not altered by sPLA(2) inhibition. Tracking of drug and liposome delivery using fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry, we demonstrated that drug uptake was liposome-dependent, as encapsulation of doxorubicin in SPRL resulted in 1.5 to 2-fold greater intracellular drug levels compared to SSL. Liposome uptake was cell-dependent and did not correlate to doxorubicin uptake; however, doxorubicin uptake was generally greatest in PC-3 cells, followed by DU-145 cells and then LNCaP cells. In almost all cases, uptake of one of our formulations, SPRL-E, was greater than SSL. The therapeutic activity of SPRL in vivo was demonstrated using a mouse xenograft model of human prostate cancer, which showed that doxorubicin entrapped within SPRL decreased tumor growth compared to SSL, suggesting that SPRL are more effective at slowing tumor growth than a SSL formulation similar to the FDA approved DOXIL™. Collectively, these data show the therapeutic activity of SPRL compared to SSL, yield insights into the mechanisms of action of these nanoparticles and suggest that SPRL could be useful for treatment of other pathologies that over express sPLA(2).""","""['J N Mock', 'L J Costyn', 'S L Wilding', 'R D Arnold', 'B S Cummings']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Integr Biol (Camb)""","""['Liposomes Targeting P21 Activated Kinase-1 (PAK-1) and Selective for Secretory Phospholipase A2 (sPLA2) Decrease Cell Viability and Induce Apoptosis in Metastatic Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Cells.', 'Role of the phospholipase A2 receptor in liposome drug delivery in prostate cancer cells.', 'Sterically stabilized liposomes targeting P21 (RAC1) activated kinase-1 and secreted phospholipase A2 suppress prostate cancer growth and metastasis.', 'Role of secretory phospholipases in atherogenesis.', 'Role of secretory phospholipase a(2) in CNS inflammation: implications in traumatic spinal cord injury.', 'Targeting P21-Activated Kinase-1 for Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Liposomes in Cancer Therapy: How Did We Start and Where Are We Now.', 'The Use of Nanomedicine to Target Signaling by the PAK Kinases for Disease Treatment.', 'Triggered Drug Release From Liposomes: Exploiting the Outer and Inner Tumor Environment.', 'Safe Nanoparticles: Are We There Yet?']"""

Method:   Patients (N = 42) attending pre-treatment, treatment and follow-up clinics were provided with information designed to help them manage their emotional reactions to cancer. Patients were interviewed 3-4 weeks later about their emotional experience of cancer and their attitudes towards managing emotional problems. Qualitative data analysis followed a constant comparative approach.  Results:   Patients early in the cancer trajectory, who had not yet been engaged in chemotherapy or radiotherapy, described emotional distress as a temporary and understandable reaction that did not warrant professional intervention. They valued knowing that support was available, but did not want to use it, and were reluctant to acknowledge or address emotional needs. Conversely, patients currently or recently engaged in treatment readily acknowledged their emotional needs and welcomed help to address these.  Conclusions:   Drawing on social cognitive and other theories, we suggest that engagement in physical treatment and care allows patients to address emotional needs following a cancer diagnosis. Guidance that emotional needs should routinely be assessed and addressed at key points in the cancer trajectory should therefore be implemented cautiously when patients are only recently diagnosed; psychological intervention may be less appropriate at this time than later.""","""['Paul Baker', 'Helen Beesley', 'Robert Dinwoodie', 'Ian Fletcher', 'Jan Ablett', 'Christopher Holcombe', 'Peter Salmon']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Psychooncology""","""['Women with newly diagnosed breast cancer and their perceptions of needs in a health-care context.', 'Changes and predictors of unmet supportive care needs in Taiwanese women with newly diagnosed breast cancer.', 'The importance of relationships in the experience of cancer: a re-working of the policy ideal of the whole-systems approach.', ""'Getting back to normal' or 'a new type of normal'?

We prospectively examined the efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant therapy with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist + low-dose estramustine phosphate (EMP) (LHRH+EMP) followed by RP.  Methods:   High-risk Pca was defined by the D'Amico stratification system. A total of 142 patients with high-risk Pca were enrolled in this trial from September 2005 to March 2011. The LHRH+EMP therapy included administration of LHRH agonist and 280 mg day(-1) EMP for 6 months before RP. Pathological cancer-free (pT0) rate on the surgical specimen was the primary end point. Secondary end points were PSA-free survival and toxicity.  Results:   The average patient age was 67.4 years (interquartile range (IQR) 72, 65) and the median initial PSA level was 14.80 ng ml(-1) (IQR 26.22, 7.13).

In androgen-depleted media, LNCaP-AI cells showed exquisite sensitivity to growth inhibition by subnanomolar concentrations of a small molecule inhibitor of Plk1, BI2536, suggesting that these cells are dependent on Plk1 for growth. In contrast, the androgen-responsive parental LNCaP cells showed negligible responses to BI2536 treatment under the same condition. BI2536 treatment of LNCaP-AI cells resulted in an increase in cell death marker PARP-1 (polymerase-1) but did not activate caspase-3, an apoptosis marker, suggesting that the observed cell death was caspase-independent. BI2536-treated LNCaP-AI cells formed multinucleated giant cells that contain clusters of nuclear vesicles indicative of mitotic catastrophe. Live-cell time-lapse imaging revealed that BI2536-treated giant LNCaP-AI cells underwent necroptosis, as evidenced by 'explosive' cell death and partial reversal of cell death by a necroptosis inhibitor. Our studies suggest that LNCaP-AI cells underwent reprogramming in both their cell growth and cell death pathways, rendering them highly sensitive to Plk1 inhibition that induces necroptosis.

Current research suggests that standard chemotherapy regimens have been optimized to maximal efficiency. Promising new treatment strategies involve novel agents targeting molecular aberrations present in subsets of NSCLC. We evaluated 88 human NSCLC tumors of diverse histology and identified Mer and Axl as receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) overexpressed in 69% and 93%, respectively, of tumors relative to surrounding normal lung tissue. Mer and Axl were also frequently overexpressed and activated in NSCLC cell lines. Ligand-dependent Mer or Axl activation stimulated MAPK, AKT and FAK signaling pathways indicating roles for these RTKs in multiple oncogenic processes. In addition, we identified a novel pro-survival pathway-involving AKT, CREB, Bcl-xL, survivin, and Bcl-2-downstream of Mer, which is differentially modulated by Axl signaling. We demonstrated that short hairpin RNA (shRNA) knockdown of Mer or Axl significantly reduced NSCLC colony formation and growth of subcutaneous xenografts in nude mice. Mer or Axl knockdown also improved in vitro NSCLC sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents by promoting apoptosis.

Radiation Therapy for prostate cancer can increase the risk for the development of second cancers after treatment. This study highlights the fact that such second cancers within the pelvis do occur but are not as common as previously reported. In this report we also note that even among patients who develop second cancers, if detected earlier, the majority are alive 5 years after the diagnosis.  Objective:   • To report on the incidence of secondary malignancy (SM) development after external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) and brachytherapy (BT) for prostate cancer and to compare this with a cohort contemporaneously treated with radical prostatectomy (RP).  Materials and methods:   • Between 1998 and 2001, 2658 patients with localized prostate cancer were treated with RP (n = 1348), EBRT (n = 897) or BT (n = 413). • Using the RP cohort as a control we compared the incidence of SMs, such as rectal or bladder cancers noted within the pelvis, and the incidence of extrapelvic SMs.  Results:   • The 10-year SM-free survival for the RP, BT and EBRT cohorts were 89%, 87%, and 83%, respectively (RP vs EBRT, P = 0.002; RP vs BT, P = 0.37). • The 10-year likelihoods for bladder or colorectal cancer SM development in the RP, BT and EBRT groups were 3%, 2% and 4%, respectively (P = 0.29). • Multivariate analysis of predictors for development of all SMs showed that older age (P = 0.01) and history of smoking (P < 0.001) were significant predictors for the development of a SM, while treatment intervention was not found to be a significant variable. • Among 243 patients who developed a SM, the 5-year likelihood of SM-related mortality among patients with SMs in the EBRT and BT groups was 43.7% and 15.6%, respectively, compared with 26.3% in the RP cohort; P = 0.052).  Conclusions:   • The incidence of SM after radiotherapy was not significantly different from that after RP when adjusted for patient age and smoking history. • The incidence of bladder and rectal cancers was low for both EBRT- and BT-treated patients. • Among patients who developed a SM, the likelihood of mortality related to the SM was not significantly different among the treatment cohorts.""","""['Michael J Zelefsky', 'Xin Pei', 'Tatiana Teslova', 'Deborah Kuk', 'Juan Martin Magsanoc', 'Marisa Kollmeier', 'Brett Cox', 'Zhigang Zhang']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Commentary on ""secondary cancers after intensity-modulated radiotherapy, brachytherapy, and radical prostatectomy for the treatment of prostate cancer: incidence and cause-specific survival outcomes according to the initial treatment intervention.""

Docetaxel rechallenge has shown preserved anti-tumour activity and has therefore been proposed as an option for further treatment in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, who have shown a good response to first-line chemotherapy with docetaxel. The present study provides evidence of docetaxel activity in patients who were treated with full-dose (75 mg/m(2) ) 3-weekly docetaxel at first-line chemotherapy and rechallenge. It shows that PSA response to first-line chemotherapy may provide a rational indication for docetaxel rechallenge.  Objective:   • To determine whether prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response at first-line chemotherapy with docetaxel correlates with PSA response and survival at docetaxel rechallenge in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).  Patients and methods:   • We retrospectively evaluated the oncological outcomes of patients with mCRPC, who were treated with full-dose (75 mg/m(2) ), 3-weekly docetaxel plus prednisone/prednisolone at first-line chemotherapy and rechallenge, between 1999 and 2011, at our institution. • The endpoints were PSA-progression-free survival (PSA-PFS) and overall survival (OS) at docetaxel rechallenge. • Statistical analyses included Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank tests to evaluate the effect of PSA response at first-line chemotherapy on PSA-PFS and OS at rechallenge.  Results:   • Fourty-four patients were included in the analysis. • At a median (range) follow-up of 26.4 (9.8-89.8) months after the first administration of docetaxel, 24 (55%) patients had died. At first-line chemotherapy, 36 (82%) patients achieved a reduction in PSA level of ≥50%. At rechallenge, 10 (28%) patients responded with a reduction of ≥50% for a second time. • The median (95% confidence interval [CI]) PSA-PFS was 5.9 (95% CI 3.5-6.8) months and the median OS was 21.8 (95% CI 19.9-23.7) months at docetaxel rechallenge. • Of the PSA response variables evaluated, only a PSA level reduction of ≥50% at first-line chemotherapy correlated significantly with prolonged PSA-PFS (5.8 vs. 4.5 months; P= 0.01) and OS (22.1 vs. 7.2 months; P= 0.03) at rechallenge.  Conclusion:   • In the present single-institution study, a reduction in PSA level of ≥50% at first-line chemotherapy with docetaxel correlated with superior PSA-PFS and OS in the rechallenge setting and might, therefore, present a rational indication for docetaxel rechallenge.""","""['Matthias M Heck', 'Mark Thalgott', 'Margitta Retz', 'Petra Wolf', 'Tobias Maurer', 'Roman Nawroth', 'Georgios Hatzichristodoulou', 'Jürgen E Gschwend', 'Hubert Kübler']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Docetaxel in the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC): an observational study in a single institution.', 'The interval from the last cycle of docetaxel-based chemotherapy to progression is associated with the efficacy of subsequent docetaxel in patients with prostate cancer.', 'Prostate-specific antigen response to deferred combined androgen blockade therapy using bicalutamide predicts survival after subsequent oestrogen and docetaxel therapies in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Chemotherapy in hormone-refractory prostate cancer.', 'Expert opinion on chemotherapy use in castration-resistant prostate cancer progressing after docetaxel.', 'Artesunate Inhibits the Growth Behavior of Docetaxel-Resistant Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Docetaxel Rechallenge Improves Survival in Patients With Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer: A Retrospective Study.', 'Docetaxel-rechallenge in castration-resistant prostate cancer: defining clinical factors for successful treatment response and improvement in overall survival.', 'Prostate-specific antigen response rate of sequential chemotherapy in castration-resistant prostate cancer: the results of real life practice.', 'Drug rechallenge and treatment beyond progression--implications for drug resistance.']"""

The ability to identify and visualize target expression in normal tissues could reveal causes for target-mediated clearance observed in pharmacokinetic characterization. TENB2 is a prostate cancer target associated with the progression of poorly differentiated and androgen-independent tumour types, and ADCs specific for TENB2 are candidate therapeutics. The objective of this study was to locate antigen expression of TENB2 in normal tissues, thereby elucidating the underlying causes of target-mediated clearance.  Experimental approach:   A series of pharmacokinetics, tissue distribution and mass balance studies were conducted in mice using a radiolabelled anti-TENB2 ADC. These data were complemented by non-invasive single photon emission computed tomography - X-ray computed tomography imaging and immunohistochemistry.  Key results:   The intestines were identified as a saturable and specific antigen sink that contributes, at least in part, to the rapid target-mediated clearance of the anti-TENB2 antibody and its drug conjugate in rodents. As a proof of concept, we also demonstrated the selective disposition of the ADC in a tumoural environment in vivo using the LuCaP 77 transplant mouse model. High tumour uptake was observed despite the presence of the antigen sink, and antigen specificity was confirmed by antigen blockade.  Conclusions and implications:   Our findings provide the anatomical location and biological interpretation of target-mediated clearance of anti-TENB2 antibodies and corresponding drug conjugates. Further investigations may be beneficial in addressing the relative contributions to ADC disposition from antigen expression in both normal and pathological tissues.""","""['C Andrew Boswell', 'Eduardo E Mundo', 'Ron Firestein', 'Crystal Zhang', 'Weiguang Mao', 'Herman Gill', 'Cynthia Young', 'Nina Ljumanovic', 'Shannon Stainton', 'Sheila Ulufatu', 'Aimee Fourie', 'Katherine R Kozak', 'Reina Fuji', 'Paul Polakis', 'Leslie A Khawli', 'Kedan Lin']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Br J Pharmacol""","""['Differential effects of predosing on tumor and tissue uptake of an 111In-labeled anti-TENB2 antibody-drug conjugate.', 'Impact of drug conjugation on pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution of anti-STEAP1 antibody-drug conjugates in rats.', 'ImmunoPET helps predicting the efficacy of antibody-drug conjugates targeting TENB2 and STEAP1.', 'Pharmacokinetic Considerations for Antibody-Drug Conjugates against Cancer.', 'Progress on pharmacokinetic study of antibody-drug conjugates.', 'Development of a Physiologically-Based Pharmacokinetic Model for Whole-Body Disposition of MMAE Containing Antibody-Drug Conjugate in Mice.', 'Poor outcome with anti-programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) antibody due to poor pharmacokinetic properties in PD-1/PD-L1 blockade-sensitive mouse models.', 'Biodistribution and efficacy of an anti-TENB2 antibody-drug conjugate in a patient-derived model of prostate cancer.', 'Production, characterization, and in vivo half-life extension of polymeric IgA molecules in mice.', 'Antibody-Drug Conjugates: Possibilities and Challenges.']"""

The double jeopardy hypothesis suggests being a minority and old could have compounding effects on health. This population-based study examined the physical and mental function of older adults by age (mean age = 75.7, SD = 6.1), ethnicity/race, and cancer (breast, prostate, colorectal, and gynecologic) as well as interaction effects between age, ethnicity/race and HRQOL. There was evidence of a significant age by ethnicity/race interaction in physical function for breast, prostate and all sites combined, but the interaction became non-significant (for breast and all sites combined) when comorbidity was entered into the model. The interaction persisted in the prostate cancer group after controlling for comorbidity, such that African Americans and Asian Americans in the 75-79 age group report lower physical health than non-Hispanic Whites and Hispanic Whites in this age group. The presence of double jeopardy in the breast and all sites combined group can be explained by a differential comorbid burden among the older (75-79) minority group, but the interaction found in prostate cancer survivors does not reflect this differential comorbid burden.""","""['Keith M Bellizzi', 'Noreen M Aziz', 'Julia H Rowland', 'Kathryn Weaver', 'Neeraj K Arora', 'Ann S Hamilton', 'Ingrid Oakley-Girvan', 'Gretchen Keel']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""J Cancer Epidemiol""","""['Racial and Ethnic Variations in Pre-Diagnosis Comorbidity Burden and Health-Related Quality of Life Among Older Women with Breast Cancer.', 'The effects of cancer and racial disparities in health-related quality of life among older Americans: a case-control, population-based study.', 'Racial/ethnic differences in health-related quality of life among female breast cancer survivors: cross-sectional findings from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey.', 'Socioeconomic status and prostate cancer incidence and mortality rates among the diverse population of California.', 'Differences in breast cancer hormone receptor status and histology by race and ethnicity among women 50 years of age and older.', 'Underlying mechanisms of change in cancer prevalence in older U.S. adults: contributions of incidence, survival, and ascertainment at early stages.', 'Assessing the Relationship between Socioeconomic Status, Race, and Psychological Distress in Cancer Survivors: A Population Based Study.', 'The current status of survivorship care provision at the state level: a Wisconsin-based assessment.', 'Calidad de Vida: a systematic review of quality of life in Latino cancer survivors in the USA.', ""Parental Educational Attainment and Academic Performance of American College Students; Blacks' Diminished Returns.""]"""

The enzyme is highly expressed in the prostate gland and previous studies indicate that genetic variation in the AKR1C3 gene may influence the prostate volume and risk of prostate cancer.  Aim:   Here we aimed to further study the genetic regulation of AKR1C3 and its putative role in prostate cancer.  Experiments:   A previously identified promoter polymorphism (A>G, rs3763676) localized at -138 from the translational start site were studied in relation to prostate cancer in a Swedish population based case-control study including 176 patients diagnosed with prostate cancer and 161 controls. Moreover, we have studied the basal and androgen induced promoter activity of the AKR1C3 gene. Expression studies with AKR1C3 promoter reporter constructs were performed in HepG2 and DSL2 cells.  Results:   We found that carriers of the promoter A-allele had a borderline significant decreased risk of prostate cancer (OR = 0.59; 95% CI = 0.32-1.08). We also show that dihydrotestosterone (DHT) induced the promoter activity of the A-allele 2.2-fold (p = 0.048).

Methods:   Core-shell nanoparticles were formulated by integrating three distinct functional components, ie, a core constituted by poly(D,L-lactic-co-glycolic acid), docetaxel, and hydrophobic superparamagnetic iron oxide nanocrystals (SPIONs), a multilayer shell formed by poly(allylamine hydrochloride) and two different sized poly(ethylene glycol) molecules, and a single-chain prostate stem cell antigen antibody conjugated to the nanoparticle surface for targeted delivery.  Results:   Drug release profiles indicated that the dual-function nanoparticles had a sustained release pattern over 764 hours, and SPIONs could facilitate the controlled release of the drug in vitro. The nanoparticles showed increased antitumor efficiency and enhanced magnetic resonance imaging in vitro through targeted delivery of docetaxel and SPIONs to PC3M cells. Moreover, in nude mice bearing PC3M xenografts, the nanoparticles provided MRI negative contrast enhancement, as well as halting and even reversing tumor growth during the 76-day study duration, and without significant systemic toxicity. The lifespan of the mice treated with these targeted dual-function nanoparticles was significantly increased (Chi-square = 22.514, P < 0.0001).

Although a possible role of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and radiation therapy (RTH) and some of their side effects have been postulated, this issue has rarely been investigated. This study aimed to (1) compare the evolution of insomnia symptoms and somatic symptoms, which may affect sleep quality (i.e., hot flashes, night sweats, and urinary symptoms), in patients receiving combined ADT and RTH with that in patients receiving RTH only and (2) assess the mediating role of somatic symptoms in the relationship of ADT and RTH with insomnia symptoms.  Methods:   Sixty men scheduled to receive RTH for prostate cancer, with (n = 28) or without (n = 32) ADT, were assessed prior to receiving any treatment (baseline) and at seven additional times over 16 months (1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 16 months) using the Insomnia Severity Index and the Physical Symptoms Questionnaire.  Results:   A significant interaction effect was found indicating an increase in insomnia scores in ADT-RTH patients at 2, 4, and 6 months, as compared with baseline, and stable scores in RTH patients. A significant mediating role of hot flashes and night sweats was found in the relationship between ADT and insomnia symptoms. The relationship with RTH was also significantly mediated by these two symptoms albeit more strongly by excessive urinary frequency.

In a population-based study of 1,323 cases and 1,268 age-matched controls, we found the NCOA4 SNP, rs7350420:T>C, was associated with a 15% reduction in PC risk, but the association was not significant after adjustment for the rs10993994:C>T genotype. Tumor tissue microarrays of 519 radical prostatectomy patients were used to measure PSP94 and NCOA4 protein expression.

Moderate to strong p(Ser2448)-mTOR staining was found in all (n = 49) normal prostate tissues, but was lost in 24% or weak in 29% cancers. Moderate and strong staining was found in 36 and 11% of tumors. Loss of p(Ser2448)-mTOR staining was significantly linked to advanced stage (p = 0.0027), high-grade (p = 0.0045), nodal positive cancers (p = 0.0483), early tumor recurrence (p < 0.0001, independently from stage and grade, p = 0.0016), lack of Ets-related gene (ERG) fusion (p < 0.0001), reduced androgen receptor expression (p < 0.0001 each) and increased cell proliferation (p = 0.0092) in all cancers and in the subset of ERG-fusion-positive cancers. Loss of p(Ser2448)-mTOR expression was linked to tumor metastasis (p = 0.0275) in ERG-fusion-positive cancers only. Molecular subset analysis using pre-existing phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) deletion data revealed that loss of p(Ser2448) -mTOR expression is of prognostic relevance and defines a subpopulation of PTEN-deleted and ERG-fusion-positive cancers with a particular poor outcome.

Fatty acid synthase (FASN), a multifunctional enzyme playing a key role in biosynthesis of FA, is up-regulated in prostate, breast, and lung carcinomas. Orlistat is a FDA-approved anti-obesity drug that inhibits the thioesterase domain of FASN, interferes with cellular FA synthesis, can arrest tumor cell proliferation, and induces tumor cell apoptosis. The current study was aimed to investigate the metabolic changes associated with FASN inhibition by orlistat and to understand the molecular mechanisms behind the observed metabolic changes in non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) cell lines.  Procedures:   Changes in metabolite pools in four NSCLC cell lines (H441, H1975, H3255, and PC14) with different mutational profiles were studied using NMR spectroscopy before and after in vitro incubation with sub-toxic concentration of orlistat and [1-(13)C]D-glucose or [1,2-(13)C2]choline. In vitro radiotracer accumulation assays in cells were performed with [(3)H]acetate, [(14)C]fluoroacetate, and 2-deoxy-2-[(18)F]fluoro-D-glucose. In parallel, microarray profiling of genes involved in the regulation of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism was performed.  Results:   In orlistat-treated NSCLC cells, FASN inhibition results in characteristic changes in intermediary metabolites (FAs, choline, phospholipids, and TCA cycle metabolites) as observed by magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Further, FASN inhibition by orlistat induces multiple adaptive changes in FA synthetic pathway and associated metabolic pathways, including induction of ketone metabolism and glutaminolysis, as well as the up-regulation of 5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase.  Conclusions:   These observed changes in metabolic pools in orlistat-treated cells demonstrate the critical role of fatty acid de novo synthesis and metabolism for cellular energy production, especially in tumor cells with low glycolytic activity, which goes beyond the widely accepted concept that FA synthesis is important for cell membrane biosynthesis in rapidly proliferating tumor cells.""","""['Madhuri Sankaranarayanapillai', 'Nianxiang Zhang', 'Keith A Baggerly', 'Juri G Gelovani']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Mol Imaging Biol""","""['Fatty acid synthase inhibition results in a magnetic resonance-detectable drop in phosphocholine.', 'Fatty acid synthase mediates EGFR palmitoylation in EGFR mutated non-small cell lung cancer.', 'Development of a Self-Assembled Nanoparticle Formulation of Orlistat, Nano-ORL, with Increased Cytotoxicity against Human Tumor Cell Lines.', 'Orlistat as a FASN inhibitor and multitargeted agent for cancer therapy.', 'Pharmacological inhibitors of Fatty Acid Synthase (FASN)--catalyzed endogenous fatty acid biogenesis: a new family of anti-cancer agents?', 'The role of altered fatty acid in pathological scars and their dermal fibroblasts.', 'Fatty Acid Synthase: An Emerging Target in Cancer.', 'AMPK activation by AICAR sensitizes prostate cancer cells to radiotherapy.', 'High-Throughput Screening of Lipidomic Adaptations in Cultured Cells.', 'Discovering Targets of Non-enzymatic Acylation by Thioester Reactivity Profiling.']"""

Several flap techniques, such as the vertical rectus abdominis musculocutaneous flap and the gracilis flap, have been reported. However, flap-specific complications have been documented. Instead of harvesting the myocutaneous flap from the abdomen or legs, our group has proposed a colonic flap for neovaginal reconstruction especially for rectal cancer with vaginal invasion. Nevertheless, the application of a colonic flap for individuals needing only vascularized tissue to fill up the pelvic dead space is problematic. The aim of this study was to demonstrate this novel technique.  Methods:   There were eight patients: three rectal cancers, one vulvar cancer with synchronous rectal cancer, one malignant nerve sheath tumor, one cervical cancer, one prostate cancer, and one rectal gastrointestinal stromal tumor. The operations included four total pelvic exenterations, three total pelvic exenterations with S3-sacrectomy, and one total pelvic exenteration with S3-sacrectomy and left nephrectomy. A colonic flap from which the mucosa was removed was used for immediate pelvic reconstruction in all patients. The flap detail involved harvesting the segment of sigmoid colon with low ligation of the inferior mesenteric artery, spatulation of the antimesenteric side of the flap, and mucosectomy. The flap was sutured to the pelvic sidewall with the mucosa-removed surface facing toward the pelvic defect.  Results:   There were no intraoperative complications, and free surgical margins were achieved. Two patients developed a fluid collection, which was successfully treated with percutaneous drainage. Perineal wound complications were not found. None of the patients developed incisional hernias or perineal hernias at the follow-up.

As the hospital volume increased, surgical duration was significantly shorter (p < 0.001) and bleeding volume decreased (p < 0.004). Analyses of perioperative care suggested that low-volume hospitals (<15 patients annually) were likely to have longer care than medium-volume (15-29 patients per year) or high-volume (≥30 patients per year) hospitals, and the length of actual care was prolonged in the low-volume hospitals. Multivariate logistic regression analysis suggested that the occurrence of postoperative complications was significantly associated with surgeon's volume (p = 0.004), patient age (p = 0.001), preoperative anticoagulant therapy (p = 0.045), coexistent diabetes mellitus (p = 0.009), surgical duration (p = 0.002) and bleeding volume (p < 0.001), but not hospital volume.

The activity of extracellular regulated protein kinases1/2( ERK1/2) pathway was detected by western-blot in the three groups. The FGF8b-DU145 cells and DU145 cells were cultured with PD98059 (an ERK kinase inhibitor) to observe microscopically the morphology changes within the cells. The experimental samples were also divided into four groups: FGF8b/DU145 cells cultured with 2% FBS (Group A); FGF8b/DU145 cells cultured with 2% FBS+PD98059 (50 μmol/L) (Group B); DU145 cells cultured with 2% FBS (Group C); DU145 cells cultured with FBS+PD98059 (50 μmol/L) (Group D). The expression of epithelial- mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers (E-cadherin, vimentin) were detected by western-blot analysis and the cell's mobility were detected by the Transwell chamber.  Results:   The activity of ERK1/2 in the experimental group was significantly higher than that in the other two control groups; when ERK kinase inhibitor PD98059 was added to FGF8b/ DU145 cells, the expression of epithelial marker E-cadherin protein was significantly increased in group B compared with that in the group A (P<0.05). The expression of mesenchymal marker vimentin protein was significantly reduced in group B compared with that in group A (P<0.05). The cell migration assay suggested that cell migration was markedly decreased in group B (P<0.05) compared with that in group A.  Conclusion:   EMT in prostate cancer induced by FGF8b can be mediated by ERK kinase pathway, in which mitogen-activated/extraceluer signal regulated kinase 1 (MEK1) may be a key factor.

Methods:   Twenty patients suspicious of having prostate cancer were included. Seventeen patients were pre-biopsied once or more. Each patient was examined by multiparametric MRI and C-TRUS, followed by a guided transrectal prostate biopsy series. Patients were stratified in a ""low-risk"" and ""high-risk"" group. The results were analyzed using descriptive statistics.  Results:   In 58 % (11 pat.) of patients, prostate cancer was found.

Cell proliferation was measured with a BrdU Assay and Countess Automated Cell Counter, thus determining the influence of angiotensins on hormone-dependent (LNCaP) and hormone-independent (DU-145) human prostate cancer lines. The influence of Ang III and Ang II on classic receptors may be inhibited by Losartan or PD123319. Test peptide modulation of the AT1 and AT2 receptors was examined by Western Blot and fluorescent immunocytochemistry. The results indicate that Ang III promotes the migration of both LNCaP and DU-145 lines, whereas Ang II stimulates this process only in androgen-independent cells. Both angiotensin peptides can induce prostate cancer cell proliferation in a time- and dose-dependent manner. The obtained results show that Ang III and Ang II can modify the expression of classic receptors, particularly AT2.

Visualization of the organs at risk (OAR) and the planning target volume (PTV) is hindered by the large amount of artifact streaking between the metallic implants. The density of this area must be accounted for when using heterogeneity correction. Fusion of a megavolt computed tomography (MVCT) to the planning CT aids in viewing the prostate, bladder, and rectum, and implantation of 6 fiducial markers along the posterior border of the prostate helps with the delineation between it and the rectum. When planning, the amount of beam entry angles is limited because of the position of the prostheses and prevents the use of any lateral beams. Therefore, TomoTherapy presents an effective option for these patients because of the ability to use a directional block, which prevents any primary beams from entering through the bilateral hip prostheses (but the beams may exit through the structures), use of MVCT for daily localization, and delivery of radiation with intensity modulation allows for effective sparing of the OAR.""","""['Justin Kling', 'Kamal M Patel']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Med Dosim""","""['High-dose-rate prostate brachytherapy in a patient with bilateral hip prostheses planned using megavoltage computed tomography images acquired with a helical tomotherapy unit.', 'Intensity-modulated radiation therapy with noncoplanar beams for treatment of prostate cancer in patients with bilateral hip prosthesis-a case study.', 'Automated generation of IMRT treatment plans for prostate cancer patients with metal hip prostheses: comparison of different planning strategies.', 'Megavoltage CT images of helical tomotherapy unit for radiation treatment simulation: impact on feasibility of treatment planning in a prostate cancer patient with bilateral femoral prostheses.', 'Comparison of image-guided radiotherapy technologies for prostate cancer.', 'Determining efficient helical IMRT modulation factor from the MLC leaf-open time distribution on precision treatment planning system.']"""

For example, estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) physically binds to peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) and inhibits its transcriptional activity. The interaction between PPARγ and the vitamin D receptor (VDR) however, is unknown. Here, we elucidate the molecular mechanisms linking PPARγ and VDR signaling, and for the first time we show that PPARγ physically associates with VDR in human breast cancer cells. We found that overexpression of PPARγ decreased 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (1,25D(3)) mediated transcriptional activity of the vitamin D target gene, CYP24A1, by 49% and the activity of VDRE-luc, a vitamin D responsive reporter, by 75% in T47D human breast cancer cells. Deletion mutation experiments illustrated that helices 1 and 4 of PPARγ's hinge and ligand binding domains, respectively, governed this suppressive function. Additionally, abrogation of PPARγ's AF2 domain attenuated its repressive action on 1,25D(3) transactivation, indicating that this domain is integral in inhibiting VDR signaling. PPARγ was also found to compete with VDR for their binding partner retinoid X receptor alpha (RXRα). Overexpression of RXRα blocked PPARγ's suppressive effect on 1,25D(3) action, enhancing VDR signaling.

However, reconstruction of OBS by the traditional hand suture method (THSM) is a time-consuming process. Stapling techniques are considered to be inferior to hand-sewn methods. We report our experience and functional results in patients with W-ileal neobladder by a hand-assisted-drawing-needle running suture (HADNRS).  Methods:   Between April 1993 and December 2011, 347 patients (338 men and 9 women) aged 28 - 77 years (median age: 59 years) underwent radical cystectomy, followed by the creation of a modified W-ileal neobladder by HADNRS with a curved needle. A total of 347 (20 patients in 2003) were evaluated by urodynamic tests.  Results:   The operative time ranged from 110 to 310 minutes (mean 148 minutes), and the mean time of reconstruction by HADNRS, excluding ureterointestinal and ileouretral anastomosis, was (20.2 ± 4.3) minutes. Histopathological analysis of removed specimens showed that 317 patients had transitional cell bladder carcinoma. Of these 317 patients, 19 also had squamous carcinoma and 13 had adenocarcinoma. Glandularis and prostate cancer occurred in 16 and 14 patients, respectively. Three patients (0.8%) had neobladder abdominal fistula. No other early complications or injury to the surgeon's hands occurred due to HADNRS. Of the 20 cases with urodynamic examinations in 2003, two suffered from daytime incontinence and six had nocturnal incontinence. The maximum capacity of the neobladder was (492.9 ± 177.8) ml, and the maximum pressure within the reservoir at the end of filling was (32.1 ± 8.6) cmH2O.

In vivo, Af-METase (40.8 U/ml) have T(1/2) 19.8 h, elimination constant 0.088 U/h and apparent volume distribution 85 U/ml. Also, Af-METase has two maxima one at A(280 nm) (apo-enzyme) and at A(420 nm) (internal Schiff base of PLP), unlike control plasma (without enzyme). The two peaks of absorption spectra were detected maximally at 15 min then the absorbance at 420 nm was subsequently decreased with circulation time, due to dissociation of the co-enzyme. The A₂₈₀/₄₂₀ ratio was increased from 1.69 to 5.81 with circulation time from 15 to 30 h. Rabbits plasma methionine was depleted from 18.7 μM (control) to 8.8 μM after 1h of enzyme injection and completely omitted after 2 h till 19 h, assuming the sustainability of negligible levels of methionine (< 2 μM) in plasma of rabbits, for about 17 h. Upon infusion of PLP, the T(½) of Af-METase was significantly prolonged by 3.2 fold, assuming the fully reconstitution of the enzyme. The holo-AfMETase still retained its co-enzyme, completely, till 33 h of PLP infusion. From spectral studies, the internal aldimine linkage of apo-Af-METase was constructed upon PLP infusion, with fully catalytic structure after less than 4h of its infusion, the A₂₈₀/₄₂₀ ratio being not relatively changed till 45 h. After 25 days of last enzyme dose, the titer of IgG was increase by about 1.66 fold comparing to control (without enzyme). However, IgM was not detected along the tested challenge points. In vitro, plasma anti-Af-METase neutralizing antibodies (NAb) were assessed, with no significant reduction on activity of Af-METase by Nab.

The prevalence of metabolic syndrome is increasing worldwide and is associated with increased age, obesity and hypogonadism. The association between metabolic syndrome and prostate cancer development has not been studied comprehensively, and published studies report divergent results. This study indicates that tumours detected in men with metabolic syndrome are more aggressive than those detected in men without this condition.  Objective:   To further examine the association between metabolic syndrome (MS), prostate cancer (PC) detection risk and tumour aggressiveness.

MS was evaluated according to the National Cholesterol Education Program Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults, Adult Treatment Panel III definition. Tumour aggressiveness was evaluated through biopsy Gleason score, clinical stage and risk of biochemical recurrence after primary treatment.  Results:   The rates of PC detection were 34.5% and 36.4% respectively in men with and without MS, P = 0.185. High grade PC rates (Gleason score 8-10) were 35.9% and 23.9% respectively, P < 0.001. The advanced disease rates (cT3-4 N0-1 M0-1) were 17% and 12.7% respectively, P = 0.841.

Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer diagnosed among elderly men. Current standard of care with surgery, chemotherapy or radiation in prostate cancer patients are of limited efficacy, especially in the androgen refractory state of the disease, and unfortunately metastatic disease remains incurable. Skeletal metastases are the most common site for metastases for prostate cancer and bisphosphonates have been widely used for the treatment of morbidity due to skeletal related events. Zoledronic acid (ZA) is the most potent member of the nitrogen containing new generation bisphosphonate (N-BPs) family. Okadaic acid (OA) and Calyculin A (CA) are the most commonly used inhibitors of PP1 and 2A. OA, extracted from common black sponge Halachondria okaddai is a potent inhibitor of protein phosphatases, PP1 and PP2A, and CA was isolated from another marine sponge, Discodermia calyx. Therapies based on combinations of chemotherapeutics with phosphatase inhibitors that target signaling pathways within the cell with different mechanisms of action, may be useful for increasing therapeutic effect and also diminish toxic side effects by decreasing the doses of conventional chemotherapeutics. Although clinically well known, the in vitro effects of ZA on cancer cells and the underlying mechanisms are not well elucidated. In our previous studies, we have already shown anticancer effect of ZA in hormone-and drug refractory prostate cancer cells, PC-3 and DU-145. In addition to this, we have also shown that this anticancer effect may be augmented with some cytotoxic agents in prostate cancer. Now, in our present study, we have investigated whether ZA induced growth inhibition and apoptosis in PC-3 and DU-145 may be enhanced by the combination with CA or OA, through inhibition of serine/threonine phosphatases in prostate cancer cells. Both ZA/CA and ZA/OA combinations inhibited the cell viability of hormone-and drug refractory prostate cancer cells at in vivo achievable therapeutic concentrations. Moreover, a potentiation of the apoptotic effects of the combinations was also observed in the same experimental conditions. This is the first report of a synergistic combination of ZA with phosphatase inhibitors CA and OA which inhibits cell viability and induces apoptosis in human hormone and drug refractory prostate cancer cells.  Objectives:   • To investigate if the cytotoxic and apoptotic effect of zoledronic acid (ZA) can be enhanced by the addition of the serine/threonine protein phosphatase inhibitors calyculin A (CA) and okadaic acid (OA) in hormone and drug refractory prostate cancer cells, PC-3 and DU-145. • To discover the effect of these combination treatments on phosphatase 1 (PP1) and PP2A protein expression levels in prostate cancer cells.  Materials and methods:   • An XTT cell viability assay was used to determine cytotoxicity. • Apoptosis was evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using a Cell Death Detection ELISA Plus Kit and verified by measuring caspase 3/7 enzyme activity. • The PP1 and PP2A enzyme activities were evaluated by serine/threonine phosphatase ELISA and expression levels of PP1 and PP2A proteins were then re-assessed by Western blot analysis.  Results:   • Combination of ZA with either CA or OA showed synergistic cytotoxicity and apoptosis compared with any agent alone in both PC-3 and DU-145 prostate cancer cells. • The combination of ZA with phosphatase inhibitors resulted in enhanced suppression of both PP1 and PP2A enzyme activity and protein levels, which was more overt with the ZA/CA combination.  Conclusion:   • Results from our study increase the translational potential of our in vitro findings and offer the basic rationale for the design of new combinatory strategies with ZA and phosphatase inhibitors for the treatment of prostate cancer, which may become resistant to conventional therapy.""","""['Yalcin Cirak', 'Umut Varol', 'Harika Atmaca', 'Asli Kisim', 'Canfeza Sezgin', 'Bulent Karabulut', 'Selim Uzunoglu', 'Ruchan Uslu', 'Burcak Karaca']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Combination of zoledronic acid and serine/threonine phosphatase inhibitors induces synergistic cytotoxicity and apoptosis in human breast cancer cells via inhibition of PI3K/Akt pathway.', 'Carnosic acid modulates Akt/IKK/NF-κB signaling by PP2A and induces intrinsic and extrinsic pathway mediated apoptosis in human prostate carcinoma PC-3 cells.', 'The in vitro anti-tumour activity of zoledronic acid and docetaxel at clinically achievable concentrations in prostate cancer.', 'Microcystin-LR and okadaic acid-induced cellular effects: a dualistic response.', 'Pharmacokinetic evaluation of zoledronic acid.', 'IKKα promotes lung adenocarcinoma growth through ERK signaling activation via DARPP-32-mediated inhibition of PP1 activity.', 'Bone Health Issues in Patients with Prostate Cancer: An Evidence-Based Review.', 'Activation of the Tumor Suppressor PP2A Emerges as a Potential Therapeutic Strategy for Treating Prostate Cancer.', 'Targeting bone metabolism in patients with advanced prostate cancer: current options and controversies.', 'Protective effects of humanin on okadaic Acid-induced neurotoxicities in cultured cortical neurons.']"""

What's known on the subject? and What does the study add? Geographical and ethnic differences in the distribution of BPH and the results of migrant studies indicate that not only age, androgens and genetics, but also modifiable factors may play a role in the aetiology of BPH. Oxidative stress induced by chronic inflammation could be a cause and antioxidants, including selenoproteins, may reduce the risk. The published data related to this topic are scarce and are mainly based on cross-sectional and case-control studies. In a nested case-control study, we observed a significant inverse association between serum selenium concentrations and the risk of BPH. These results need to be confirmed in larger, prospective epidemiological studies. Prostate enlargement is an increasing health problem as a result of an ageing population in many countries. Modifiable factors may also play a role. In the present study, before this antioxidant can be recommended as a preventive measure.  Objective:   • To determine whether geographical differences in the distribution of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and migrant studies indicate that modifiable factors play a role in the aetiology of BPH. Oxidative stress produced by chronic inflammation could represent one of the causes, and antioxidants, including selenoproteins, may reduce the risk.  Subjects and methods:   • Conditional logistic regression was used to examine the associations of serum selenium and selenoprotein P concentrations and glutathione peroxidase activity with respect to the risk of BPH in a case-control study nested in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition-Heidelberg cohort, including 111 cases and 214 matched controls. • In addition, dietary glucosinolate intake and the serum glutathione S-transferase α concentration was investigated.  Results:   • The risk of BPH significantly decreased with an increasing serum selenium concentration; the risk estimate was 0.83 (35% CI 0.69-0.99) per 10 µg/L increase in serum selenium concentration. • However, no significant association was present for serum selenoprotein P concentration or glutathione peroxidase activity. Risk estimates for BPH decreased with a higher intake of glucosinolates, although the results were not statistically significant.  Conclusion:   • A low serum selenium concentration may increase the risk of BPH, although the findings reported in the present study need to be confirmed in larger, well-designed epidemiological studies.""","""['Monika Eichholzer', 'Astrid Steinbrecher', 'Rudolf Kaaks', 'Birgit Teucher', 'Jakob Linseisen', 'Sabine Rohrmann']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Dietary glucosinolate intake, polymorphisms in selected biotransformation enzymes, and risk of prostate cancer.', 'Depressed serum selenoprotein P: possible new predicator of increased risk for cerebrovascular events.', 'Whole blood selenium levels (WBSL) in patients with prostate cancer (PC), benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and healthy male inhabitants (HMI) and prostatic tissue selenium levels (PTSL) in patients with PC and BPH.', 'New insights into the epidemiology and natural history of benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'The controversial relationship between benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer: the role of inflammation.', 'Human, Animal and Plant Health Benefits of Glucosinolates and Strategies for Enhanced Bioactivity: A Systematic Review.', 'Nutraceuticals in prostate cancer therapeutic strategies and their neo-adjuvant use in diverse populations.', 'Oxidative stress in prostate hyperplasia and carcinogenesis.', 'Role of complimentary therapy for male LUTS.']"""

Amplification of KCNMA1 was restricted to a small but distinct fraction of breast, ovarian and endometrial cancer with the highest prevalence in invasive ductal breast cancers and serous carcinoma of ovary and endometrium (3-7%). We performed an extensive analysis on breast cancer tissue microarrays (TMA) of 1,200 tumors linked to prognosis. KCNMA1 amplification was significantly associated with high tumor stage, high grade, high tumor cell proliferation, and poor prognosis. Immunofluorescence revealed moderate or strong KCNMA1 protein expression in 8 out of 9 human breast cancers and in the breast cancer cell line MFM223. KCNMA1-function in breast cancer cell lines was confirmed by whole-cell patch clamp recordings and proliferation assays, using siRNA-knockdown, BK channel activators such as 17ß-estradiol and the BK-channel blocker paxilline.

Despite androgen ablation therapy, tumors eventually progress to a castrate-resistant stage in which the AR remains active. The mechanisms are poorly understood but it may be that changes in levels or activity of AR coregulators affect trafficking and activation of the receptor. A key stage in AR signaling occurs in the cytoplasm, where unliganded receptor is associated with the heat shock protein (HSP)90 foldosome complex. p23, a key component of this complex, is best characterized as a cochaperone for HSP90 but also has HSP90-independent activity and has been reported as having differential effects on the activity of different steroid receptors. Here we report that p23 increases activity of the AR, and this appears to involve steps both in the cytoplasm (increasing ligand-binding capacity, possibly via direct interaction with AR) and the nucleus (enhancing AR occupancy at target promoters). We show, for the first time, that AR and p23 can interact, perhaps directly, when HSP90 is not present in the same complex. The effects of p23 on AR activity are at least partly HSP90 independent because a mutant form of p23, unable to bind HSP90, nevertheless increases AR activity. In human prostate tumors, nuclear p23 was higher in malignant prostate cells compared with benign/normal cells, supporting the utility of p23 as a therapeutic target in prostate cancer.""","""['Vikash Reebye', 'Laia Querol Cano', 'Derek N Lavery', 'Greg N Brooke', 'Sue M Powell', 'Deepa Chotai', 'Marjorie M Walker', 'Hayley C Whitaker', 'Robin Wait', 'Helen C Hurst', 'Charlotte L Bevan']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Mol Endocrinol""","""['The co-chaperone p23 promotes prostate cancer motility and metastasis.', 'FKBP51 promotes assembly of the Hsp90 chaperone complex and regulates androgen receptor signaling in prostate cancer cells.', 'Phosphorylation of HSP90 by protein kinase A is essential for the nuclear translocation of androgen receptor.', 'Mini-review: Foldosome regulation of androgen receptor action in prostate cancer.', 'The role of the androgen receptor in the development of prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer.', 'Effect of PTGES3 on the Prognosis and Immune Regulation in Lung Adenocarcinoma.', 'The p23 co-chaperone is a succinate-activated COX-2 transcription factor in lung adenocarcinoma tumorigenesis.', 'Impact of Co-chaperones and Posttranslational Modifications Toward Hsp90 Drug Sensitivity.', 'The heterogeneity of prostate cancers lacking AR activity will require diverse treatment approaches.', 'Eighty Years of Targeting Androgen Receptor Activity in Prostate Cancer: The Fight Goes on.']"""

It has been shown that CTC cut-off values exist that predict for poorer overall survival in metastatic breast (≥5), prostate (≥5), and colorectal (≥3) cancer based on assessment of 7.5 ml of blood. Development of the CellSearch® system (Veridex) has allowed for sensitive enumeration of CTCs. In the current study, protocols were developed and optimized for use with the CellSearch system to characterize CTCs with respect to user-defined protein markers of interest in human blood samples, including the cancer stem cell marker CD44 and the apoptosis marker M-30. Flow cytometry (FCM) experiments were initially carried out to assess expression of CD44 and M-30 on MDA-MB-468 human tumor cells. Human blood samples were then spiked with MDA-MB-468 cells and processed with the appropriate antibody (CD44/M-30) on the CellSearch. Detailed optimization of CD44 was carried out on the CellSearch using various antibody concentrations, exposure times, and cell lines with varying CD44 expression. Troubleshooting experiments were undertaken to explain observed discrepancies between FCM and CellSearch results for the M-30 marker. After extensive optimization, the best CD44/M-30 concentrations and exposure times were determined to be 1.5/3.5 μg/ml and 0.2/0.8 s, respectively. The percentage of CD44(+) tumor cells was 99.5 ± 0.39% by FCM and 98.8 ± 0.51% by the CellSearch system. The percentage of M-30(+) tumor cells following paclitaxel treatment was 17.6 ± 1.18% by FCM and 10.9 ± 2.41% by CellSearch. Proper optimization of the CD44 marker was achieved; however, M-30 does not appear to be a suitable marker for use in this platform.

It is known that serum level of fibrinogen (SF) is associated with coronary artery disease and increased cardiovascular risk (CVR). The aim of this study is to determine the increase in SF and C-reactive protein (CRP) of PCa patients on ADT.  Methods:   Ninety-seven patients with locally advanced PCa (study group) were analyzed [mean age 73.4 years ± 6.3 SD, mean prostate specific antigen (PSA) 15.4 ng/ml ± 7.5 SD]. They were examined with blood chemistry including serum cholesterol (CHL), high density lipoproteins (HDL), low density lipoproteins (LDL), very low density lipoproteins, triacylglycerol (TAG), serum fibrinogen (FB), CRP and serum fasting glucose (SFG), serum testosterone, free testosterone at baseline, and after 12 months of ADT.  Results:   Patients after 12 months of ADT (study group) had significantly higher overall serum CHL (p < 0.001), higher LDL (p = 0.01), higher FB (p < 0.001), higher serum SFG (p = 0.03) in comparison with the control group.

The clinicopathological data of these patients were reviewed. The results of biopsy were 1 case with Gleason score (GS) 6, 4 cases with GS 7 and 5 cases with GS 9. In the study, 7 patients were diagnosed with cT4. Lymph node metastasis and bone metastasis were found in 5 and 4 cases, respectively. The treatments were hormonal therapy in 5 cases, radical prostatectomy in 2 cases and combination therapy in 3 cases.  Results:   During the follow-up, 6 patients were in progression within 3 to 7 months, 1 patient died after 3 years, and 4 patients were lost of the follow-up.  Conclusion:   These findings suggest that the Chinese prostate adenocarcinoma patients with age under 50 years are likely to have more aggressive tumor and combination therapy might be appropriate.""","""['Da-wei Mu', 'Zhi-song He', 'Wei Yu', 'Yi Song', 'Xue-song Li', 'Li-qun Zhou', 'Jie Jin', 'Shu-qing Li', 'Gang-zhi Shan', 'Xin-yu Yang', 'Qun He']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Beijing Da Xue Xue Bao Yi Xue Ban""","""['Adenocarcinoma of the prostate with Gleason score 9-10 on core biopsy: correlation with findings at radical prostatectomy and prognosis.', 'The percent of cores positive for cancer in prostate needle biopsy specimens is strongly predictive of tumor stage and volume at radical prostatectomy.', 'Relationship between systematic biopsies and histological features of 222 radical prostatectomy specimens: lack of prediction of tumor significance for men with nonpalpable prostate cancer.', 'No difference in six-year biochemical failure rates with or without pelvic lymph node dissection during radical prostatectomy in low-risk patients with localized prostate cancer.', 'Echography and follow-up of prostate carcinoma: ""follow up echography in the course of drug therapy"".']"""

Methods:   Between May 2006 and May 2011, 200 consecutive patients with clinically localized prostate cancer underwent LRP in Peking University Third Hospital, of whom 160 were performed by a single surgeon and followed up successfully. The average age was (71.9±5.5) years (their age range: 56 to 85 years). All the patients were continent before operation. Of these patients, 11 had undergone previous transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) and the other 149 were diagnosed by transrectal prostate biopsy. No metastasis was found before surgery. The data about the patients and the operations were recorded. The time from operation till urinary continence was obtained and accessed by interviews. Continence was defined as the use of no pad and no urinary leakage or loss of a few drops occasionally. The patients were divided into 4 equal groups in the 40 consecutive series to determine whether continence was statistically different in group A (1-40) as compared with the other groups.  Results:   All the operations were performed laparoscopically without any conversion to open surgery. The mean operative duration was (230±57) min (ranging from 110 to 493 min), the median estimated blood loss was 200 mL (ranging from 30 to 1 200 mL), 12 patients (7.5%) received blood transfusions intraoperatively, and the average hospital stay after surgery was (11.8±7.9) d (ranging from 5 to 60 days). The distribution of pathologic stages was as follows: T2a 20%, T2b 16.9%, T2c 40%, T3a 15%, T3b 5.6% and T4 2.5%. The overall positive surgical margin (PSM) rate was 32.5%. The overall continence rates (no pad) were 14.4% after 1 month, 48.8% after 3 months, 77.5% after 6 months and 86.3% after 12 months. At the end of the follow-up, 21 patients (13.1%) were still incontinent . There was a significant difference in continence between the early (Group A) and later groups (P<0.05).  Conclusion:   Continence results after LRP were encouraging, which were comparable to the results in previously published open series. Continence could be improved with increasing surgical experience, and it takes 40-50 cases to reach a plateau for surgeons who have some experiences of laparoscopic operations.""","""['Jian Lin Huang', 'Lu Lin Ma', 'Yi Huang', 'Xiao Fei Hou', 'Guo Liang Wang', 'Kai Hong', 'Jian Lu', 'Chun Lei Xiao']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Beijing Da Xue Xue Bao Yi Xue Ban""","""['Laparoscopic radical prostatectomy - results of 200 consecutive cases in a Canadian medical institution.', 'Successful transfer of open surgical skills to a laparoscopic environment using a robotic interface: initial experience with laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.', 'Improve recovery of urinary continence following laparoscopic radical prostatectomy: a clinical report of 51 cases.', 'Robotic radical prostatectomy: overview of our learning curve.', 'Incontinence after laparoscopic radical prostatectomy: a reverse systematic review.', 'Analysis of the pentafecta learning curve for laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.']"""

Methods:   We retrospectively reviewed the charts of 624 consecutive patients with a pathology diagnosis of prostate cancer hospitalized in Department of Urology, Peking University First Hospital between Jan. 1994 and Dec. 2005, and evaluated the relationships between results of bone scintigraphy and serum tPSA, and between bone scintigraphy and Gleason sum. The receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves were analyzed to determine the cut-off values of tPSA and Gleason sum for predicting positive results of bone scintigraphy.  Results:   In the study, 443 patients underwent both a radionuclide bone scan and a serum PSA test prior to treatment, of whom, 216 (48.8%) got positive results, and 338 also possessed the Gleason sum for pathological evaluation. The serum tPSA levels were significantly higher in patients with positive results of the bone scan ( median: 71.00 μg/L; range: 1.30-2 400.00 μg/L) than those with negative results ( median: 60.00 μg/L; range: 0.60-201.00 μg/L; rank P<0.001), and the Gleason sums were also significantly higher in positive-bone-scan patients than in negative-bone-scan patients (7.7±1.5 vs. 6.7±1.8, P<0.001). Linear regression analysis suggested significant positive correlation between the results of the bone scan and the two afore-mentioned parameters, respectively (lg[PSA]: r=0.933, B=0.352, P=0.001; Gleason sum: r=0.971, B=0.096, P<0.001). The incidence of a positive bone scan result was 9.0% in patients with tPSA<10 μg/L and 3.8% in patients with Gleason sum<5. When the indication for bone scan was established as tPSA>15 μg/L or Gleason sum≥7,its sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and diagnostic accuracy for positive results were 97.5%, 24.7%, 54.4%, 91.5% and 60.0%, respectively.  Conclusion:   In patients with prostate cancer, their positive results of the bone scan are significantly positively correlated to their higher PSA levels and higher Gleason sums, respectively. Our analyses suggest that a patient with newly diagnosed prostate cancer would not need to undergo radionuclide bone scintigraphy when the PSA level is lower than 10 μg/L and Gleason sum is less than 5, and that a prostate cancer patient with tPSA>15 μ g/L or Gleason sum≥7 should take a bone scintigraphy.""","""['Tian-yu Wang', 'Xiao-peng Chen', 'Xue-song Li', 'Yuan xin Jia', 'Jun Cheng', 'Jian-hua Zhang', 'Lin Cai', 'Zheng Zhang', 'Kan Gong', 'Zhi-song He', 'Li-qun Zhou']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Beijing Da Xue Xue Bao Yi Xue Ban""","""['Prostate-specific antigen, Gleason sum and clinical T stage for predicting the need for radionuclide bone scan for prostate cancer patients in Japan.', 'Establishing the pathways and indications for performing isotope bone scans in newly diagnosed intermediate-risk localised prostate cancer - results from a large contemporaneous cohort.', 'Predicting radionuclide bone scan findings in patients with newly diagnosed, untreated prostate cancer: prostate specific antigen is superior to all other clinical parameters.', 'Prostatic specific antigen and bone scan in the diagnosis and follow-up of prostate cancer.

Methods and materials:   A total of 740 prostate cancer patients who received C-ion RT between April 2000 and February 2009 were analyzed. Of those, 664 patients followed for at least 1 year were analyzed with regard to late radiation toxicity. Biochemical relapse-free (BRF) and overall survival (OS) rates in patient subgroups with each dose-fractionation were analyzed.  Results:   Only 1 case of grade 3 genitourinary (GU) morbidity was observed in 20 fractions, and none of the patients developed higher grade morbidities. The incidence of late GU toxicity in patients treated with 16 fractions was lower than that of patients treated with 20 fractions. The OS rate and BRF rate of the entire group at 5 years were 95.2% and 89.7%, respectively. The 5-year BRF rate of the patients treated with 16 fractions of C-ion RT (88.5%) was comparable to that of the patients treated with 20 fractions (90.2%).  Conclusion:   C-ion RT of 57.6 GyE (the physical C-ion dose [Gy]×RBE) in 16 fractions could offer an even lower incidence of genitourinary toxicity and comparable BRF rate than that in 20 fractions.

Usually this reference is generated using control samples included in the study. However, these control samples are not always available and in these cases, an artificial reference must be created. A proper generation of this signal is crucial in terms of both noise and bias.We propose NSA (Normality Search Algorithm), a scaling method that works with and without control samples. It is based on the assumption that genomic regions enriched in SNPs with identical copy numbers in both alleles are likely to be normal. These normal regions are predicted for each sample individually and used to calculate the final reference signal. NSA can be applied to any CN data regardless the microarray technology and preprocessing method. It also finds an optimal weighting of the samples minimizing possible batch effects.  Results:   Five human datasets (a subset of HapMap samples, Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM), Ovarian, Prostate and Lung Cancer experiments) have been analyzed. It is shown that using only tumoral samples, NSA is able to remove the bias in the copy number estimation, to reduce the noise and therefore, to increase the ability to detect copy number aberrations (CNAs). These improvements allow NSA to also detect recurrent aberrations more accurately than other state of the art methods.  Conclusions:   NSA provides a robust and accurate reference for scaling probe signals data to CN values without the need of control samples. It minimizes the problems of bias, noise and batch effects in the estimation of CNs. Therefore, NSA scaling approach helps to better detect recurrent CNAs than current methods. The automatic selection of references makes it useful to perform bulk analysis of many GEO or ArrayExpress experiments without the need of developing a parser to find the normal samples or possible batches within the data. The method is available in the open-source R package NSA, which is an add-on to the aroma.cn framework. http://www.aroma-project.org/addons.""","""['Maria Ortiz-Estevez', 'Ander Aramburu', 'Angel Rubio']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Algorithms Mol Biol""","""['TumorBoost: normalization of allele-specific tumor copy numbers from a single pair of tumor-normal genotyping microarrays.', 'A novel SNP analysis method to detect copy number alterations with an unbiased reference signal directly from tumor samples.', 'Hierarchical discovery of large-scale and focal copy number alterations in low-coverage cancer genomes.', 'ACNE: a summarization method to estimate allele-specific copy numbers for Affymetrix SNP arrays.', 'Assessing copy number abnormalities and copy-neutral loss-of-heterozygosity across the genome as best practice in diagnostic evaluation of acute myeloid leukemia: An evidence-based review from the cancer genomics consortium (CGC) myeloid neoplasms working group.', 'Combined clinical and genomic signatures for the prognosis of early stage non-small cell lung cancer based on gene copy number alterations.']"""

Using data from the Netherlands Information Network of Primary Care, we selected 1256 adult breast cancer, 503 prostate cancer and 487 colorectal cancer patients diagnosed between 2001 and 2006. We compared diseases and complaints for which they contacted their General Practitioner (GP) 2-5 years after diagnosis to age and sex matched non-cancer controls from the same practice. Cancer patients consulted their GP more often than controls for acute symptoms such as abdominal pain and fatigue (18% more in breast cancer, 26% more in prostate cancer) and infections, such as cystitis or respiratory infections (45% in breast cancer and 17% in colorectal cancer). Consultations for chronic diseases and psychosocial problems were slightly increased: breast cancer patients had more contacts related to diabetes (55%), sleep disturbance (60%) and depression (64%), prostate cancer patients had more contacts related to hypertension (53) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD, 34%). Adverse drug effects were almost twice as often observed in prostate and colorectal cancer patients than in controls. Fear of cancer recurrence was noted as the reason for consulting the GP in only 20 patients.

However, scarcity and variation in size, morphology, expression profile, and antigen exposure impairs reliable detection and characterization of CTC. We have developed a noncontact, label-free microfluidic acoustophoresis method to separate prostate cancer cells from white blood cells (WBC) through forces generated by ultrasonic resonances in microfluidic channels. Implementation of cell prealignment in a temperature-stabilized (±0.5 °C) acoustophoresis microchannel dramatically enhanced the discriminatory capacity and enabled the separation of 5 μm microspheres from 7 μm microspheres with 99% purity. Next, we determined the feasibility of employing label-free microfluidic acoustophoresis to discriminate and divert tumor cells from WBCs using erythrocyte-lysed blood from healthy volunteers spiked with tumor cells from three prostate cancer cell-lines (DU145, PC3, LNCaP). For cells fixed with paraformaldehyde, cancer cell recovery ranged from 93.6% to 97.9% with purity ranging from 97.4% to 98.4%. There was no detectable loss of cell viability or cell proliferation subsequent to the exposure of viable tumor cells to acoustophoresis. For nonfixed, viable cells, tumor cell recovery ranged from 72.5% to 93.9% with purity ranging from 79.6% to 99.7%.

AND WHAT DOES THE STUDY ADD?: Androgen-ablation therapy (AAT) and chemotherapy are commonly used to treat incurable prostate cancer. To improve outcome, there is major on-going research to develop more effective treatments with less toxicity. Autophagy has been suggested from previous studies to play a potential role in cell survival and may be associated with resistance to chemotherapy. Autophagy is known to be upregulated by nutrient starvation or AAT in prostate cancer. However, its functional impact is not fully known. The present study describes the potential synergism between the blockade of autophagy and AAT alone or AAT combined with taxane chemotherapy. Hence, future combined treatment options are warranted to further investigate the clinical impact of autophagy suppression as a treatment strategy.  Objective:   To study the cellular effects of the anti-androgen bicalutamide on autophagy and its potential impact on response to androgen-ablation therapy (AAT) alone or combined with docetaxel chemotherapy in human prostate cancer LNCaP cells.  Materials and methods:   LNCaP cells were treated with bicalutamide ± docetaxel, and cellular effects were assayed: lipidated LC3 (a microtubule-associated protein) for autophagy and its trafficking to fuse with lysosome; flow cytometry using propidium iodide or caspase 3 for cell death; and sulforhodamine B assay for cell growth.  Results:   Bicalutamide treatment enhanced autophagy in LNCaP cells with increased level of autophagosome coupled with an altered cellular morphology reminiscent of neuroendocrine differentiation. Consistent with the literature on the interaction between androgen receptor activation and taxane chemotherapy, bicalutamide diminished docetaxel mediated cytotoxicity. Significantly, pharmacological inhibition of autophagy with 3-methyladenine significantly enhanced the efficacy cell kill mediated by AAT ± docetaxel.  Conclusion:   Autophagy associated with bicalutamide treatment in LNCaP cells may have a pro-survival effect and strategy to modulate autophagy may have a potential therapeutic value.""","""['Haley L Bennett', 'Jacqueline Stockley', 'Janis T Fleming', 'Ranadip Mandal', ""Jim O'Prey"", 'Kevin M Ryan', 'Craig N Robson', 'Hing Y Leung']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Targeting the pro-survival side-effects of androgen-deprivation therapy in prostate cancer.', 'Characterization of choline uptake in prostate cancer cells following bicalutamide and docetaxel treatment.', 'Androgen deprivation and androgen receptor competition by bicalutamide induce autophagy of hormone-resistant prostate cancer cells and confer resistance to apoptosis.', 'Genistein combined polysaccharide enhances activity of docetaxel, bicalutamide and Src kinase inhibition in androgen-dependent and independent prostate cancer cell lines.', 'Bicalutamide dosages used in the treatment of prostate cancer.', 'Autophagy as a modulator and target in prostate cancer.', 'Multi-omics characterization of autophagy-related molecular features for therapeutic targeting of autophagy.', 'Overcoming the mechanisms of primary and acquired resistance to new generation hormonal therapies in advanced prostate cancer: focus on androgen receptor independent pathways.', 'Oxidative stress and redox signaling in CRPC progression: therapeutic potential of clinically-tested Nrf2-activators.', 'Novel Insights into Autophagy and Prostate Cancer: A Comprehensive Review.', 'Inhibition of Scavenger Receptor Class B Type 1 (SR-B1) Expression and Activity as a Potential Novel Target to Disrupt Cholesterol Availability in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.']"""

Today, numerous assays for PSA detection are available from various manufacturers. However, these various assays do not detect PSA equally and several studies have demonstrated variability between them. In order to harmonise PSA results and reduce the discrepancies, reference materials are available for assay calibration. We have demonstrated significantly variability between 6 different assay methods currently in use in 9 hospitals despite assay calibration. Variability in PSA values was reduced with the standardisation of the assay method in 4 hospitals. Our results highlight the dilemma of PSA assay variability and stress the need for nationwide standardisation of PSA testing.  Objective:   To determine whether standardization of total prostate-specific antigen (tPSA) assay methods reduces variability in tPSA measurements.  Patients and methods:   Blood samples from 84 patients attending a single urology department were distributed across nine hospitals selected throughout Ireland for the independent determination of tPSA under the same conditions. The selected hospitals collectively used six different assay methods for tPSA detection: Beckman Hybritech WHO Calibrated (used as reference method), Tosoh AIA 1800, Roche E170 (used in three hospitals), Abbott AxSYM, Immulite 2500 2nd Generation (used in two hospitals) and Siemens ADVIA Centaur. The method of tPSA detection was next standardized in a subset of four hospitals using the same assay method and the measurements were repeated. The difference in mean tPSA in the cohort across the hospitals tested was determined and the Bland-Altman test was used to assess the agreement between each test. Analysis was performed over both the full (0.5-30 µg/L, N = 84) and a narrow (3-7 µg/L, n = 25) tPSA range.  Results:   The range and the mean tPSA of the full cohort were inflated across the eight test hospitals, when compared with the reference hospital. The poorest agreement between assay methods was associated with a bias of 2.2 ± 2.4 µg/L. The variability in tPSA measurements between assay methods was inconsistent across the range of tPSA values tested and increased with increasing mean tPSA. Agreement in reported tPSA was excellent after standardization of tPSA assay methods (bias <0.2 µg/L). Over the narrow 3-7 µg/L PSA range, 12/25 (48%) patients had a tPSA range of values across all hospitals in excess of 2 µg/L. Following standardization of the tPSA assay method, patient tPSA ranges were <0.5 µg/L for 13/25 (52%) patients.  Conclusions:   We have shown that the lack of standardization of tPSA assay methods across a panel of Irish hospitals leads to significant variability in the measured tPSA values for the same patient samples. Variability in tPSA values was reduced with the standardization of the assay method in four hospitals. Standardization of PSA testing on a nationwide scale is warranted.""","""['James C Forde', 'Laure Marignol', 'Ophelia Blake', 'Ted McDermott', 'Ronald Grainger', 'Vivien E Crowley', 'Thomas H Lynch']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Intermethod differences in results for total PSA, free PSA, and percentage of free PSA.', 'An artificial neural network for five different assay systems of prostate-specific antigen in prostate cancer diagnostics.', 'Different prostate-specific antigen assays give different results on the same blood sample: an obstacle to recommending uniform limits for prostate biopsies.', 'Issues on standardization of immunoassays for prostate-specific antigen: a review.', 'Discordant total and free prostate-specific antigen (PSA) assays: does calibration with WHO reference materials diminish the problem?', 'Comparison of Three Assays for Total and Free PSA Using Hybritech and WHO Calibrations.', 'A risk calculator to inform the need for a prostate biopsy: a rapid access clinic cohort.', 'Investigating the prostate specific antigen, body mass index and age relationship: is an age-BMI-adjusted PSA model clinically useful?', 'Molecular Form Differences Between Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) Standards Create Quantitative Discordances in PSA ELISA Measurements.', 'Predicting prostate cancer: analysing the clinical efficacy of prostate cancer risk calculators in a referral population.']"""

Here, we show that intratumoral administration of unmodified dendritic cells (DC) failed to synergize with fractionated radiotherapy. However, ionizing radiation combined with in situ vaccination with DCs, in which the immunosuppressive scavenger receptor A (SRA/CD204) has been downregulated by lentivirus-mediated gene silencing, profoundly suppressed the growth of two mouse prostate cancers (e.g., RM1 and TRAMP-C2) and prolonged the lifespan of tumor-bearing animals. Treatment of subcutaneous tumors with this novel combinatorial radioimmunotherapeutic regimen resulted in a significant reduction in distant experimental metastases. SRA/CD204-silenced DCs were highly efficient in generating antigen or tumor-specific T cells with increased effector functions (e.g., cytokine production and tumoricidal activity). SRA/CD204 silencing-enhanced tumor cell death was associated with elevated IFN-γ levels in tumor tissue and increased tumor-infiltrating CD8(+) cells. IFN-γ neutralization or depletion of CD8(+) cells abrogated the SRA/CD204 downregulation-promoted antitumor efficacy, indicating a critical role of IFN-γ-producing CD8(+) T cells. Therefore, blocking SRA/CD204 activity significantly enhances the therapeutic potency of local radiotherapy combined with in situ DC vaccination by promoting a robust systemic antitumor immunity. Further studies are warranted to test this novel combinatorial approach for translating into improved clinical outcomes in patients with prostate cancer.""","""['Chunqing Guo', 'Huanfa Yi', 'Xiaofei Yu', 'Daming Zuo', 'Jie Qian', 'Gary Yang', 'Barbara A Foster', 'John R Subjeck', 'Xiaolei Sun', 'Ross B Mikkelsen', 'Paul B Fisher', 'Xiang-Yang Wang']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Ther""","""['Targeting the immunoregulator SRA/CD204 potentiates specific dendritic cell vaccine-induced T-cell response and antitumor immunity.', 'Absence of scavenger receptor A promotes dendritic cell-mediated cross-presentation of cell-associated antigen and antitumor immune response.', 'CD204 suppresses large heat shock protein-facilitated priming of tumor antigen gp100-specific T cells and chaperone vaccine activity against mouse melanoma.', 'Dendritic cell gene therapy.', 'Dendritic Cells and Cancer Immunity.', 'SRA inhibition improves antitumor potency of antigen-targeted chaperone vaccine.', 'The role of macrophage scavenger receptor 1 (MSR1) in inflammatory disorders and cancer.', 'Dendritic Cells and Cancer Immunotherapy: The Adjuvant Effect.', 'CD8-positive T cells and CD204-positive M2-like macrophages predict postoperative prognosis of very high-risk prostate cancer.', 'Contradictory roles of lipid metabolism in immune response within the tumor microenvironment.']"""

In this study, we report that the transcription factor Twist1 mediates TGF-β-induced CLU expression. By binding to E-boxes in the distal promoter region of CLU gene, Twist1 regulated basal and TGF-β-induced CLU transcription. In addition, CLU reduction reduced TGF-β induction of the mesenchymal markers, N-cadherin and fibronectin, thereby inhibiting the migratory and invasive properties induced by TGF-β. Targeted inhibition of CLU also suppressed metastasis in an in vivo model.

Previous studies demonstrated the role of rat PTGR1 in the activation of acylfulvene analogs, a class of antitumor natural product derivatives. Of these, hydroxymethylacylfulvene (HMAF) was in advanced clinical development for the treatment of advanced solid tumors, including prostate, ovarian, and pancreatic cancers. However, the efficiency of human PTGR1 in activating acylfulvenes and its potential to enhance therapeutic efficacy have remained uncharacterized. In this study, human PTGR1 was polymerase chain reaction-cloned and purified. Conversion of HMAF to its cellular metabolite by the purified enzyme proceeded at a 20-fold higher rate than with the rat variant of the enzyme. The Km was 4.9 μM, which was 40-fold lower than for the rat variant and similar to the therapeutic dose. Human cell lines, including colon cancer lines, were transfected with a vector containing rat PTGR1 or human PTGR1, and cell viability was examined after dosing with HMAF. New data obtained in this study suggest that transfection with human PTGR1, or its induction in colon and liver cancer cell lines with 1,2-dithiol-3-thione, enhances susceptibility to the cytotoxic influences of HMAF by 2- to 10-fold. Furthermore, similar or enhanced enzyme induction and HMAF toxicity results from preconditioning cancer cells with the bioactive food components curcumin and resveratrol.

Thus, the objective of our study was to interpret the mechanisms of human AC through the regulatory network using the GSE2514 microarray data.

Changes on the level of stromal constituents, such as loss of Caveolin-1 and increased thymidine phosphorylase (TP) expression, have been associated with tumor aggressiveness. The mutual cooperation between stromal fibroblasts and cancer cells is another distinguishing feature, which has recently emerged. In this investigation, both the loss of Caveolin-1 and the increased TP expression in the prostatic TAS was associated with high Gleason score (p = 0.0002 and 0.003, respectively); the two proteins were acting both independently and synergistically. In addition, TP was significantly associated with high stromal Ki-67 (MIB1) proliferation index (p = 0.03). Analysis of the metabolic interactions between stromal and epithelial elements showed that, while prostatic cancer cells express principally (> 91%) lactate dehydrogenase-5 (LDH-5) (anaerobic metabolism), the tumor-associated fibroblasts/myofibroblasts (TAFs) express largely (67.8%) LDH-1 (aerobic metabolism)-the terms TAFs and TAS are used interchangeably. These two isoenzyme pathways act complementary; the LDH-5 pathway converts pyruvate to lactate, whereas the LDH-1 enzyme system utilizes the secreted metabolite lactate to produce pyruvate, essential for continuous energy supply to tumor cells. Monocarboxylate transporter-1 (MCT-1)-the main facilitator of lactate uptake in tumor cells, was expressed exclusively in prostate cancer cells and related directly to LDH-5 overexpression. These findings support and extend our previous studies on energy recycling between the aerobic stroma and the anaerobic cancer cells within the framework of Warburg effect.""","""['Alexandra Giatromanolaki', 'Michael I Koukourakis', 'Anastasios Koutsopoulos', 'Savvas Mendrinos', 'Efthimios Sivridis']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Cancer Biol Ther""","""['A reverse Warburg metabolism in oral squamous cell carcinoma is not dependent upon myofibroblasts.', 'Using the ""reverse Warburg effect"" to identify high-risk breast cancer patients: stromal MCT4 predicts poor clinical outcome in triple-negative breast cancers.', 'Pyruvate kinase expression (PKM1 and PKM2) in cancer-associated fibroblasts drives stromal nutrient production and tumor growth.', 'Lactate shuttle: from substance exchange to regulatory mechanism.', 'Metabolic coupling and the Reverse Warburg Effect in cancer: Implications for novel biomarker and anticancer agent development.', 'Tumor Microenvironment and Immune Response in Lip Cancer.', 'Cancer Microenvironment Defines Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocyte Density and Tertiary Lymphoid Structure Formation in Laryngeal Cancer.', 'ICIs-Related Cardiotoxicity in Different Types of Cancer.', 'Hyperpolarised 13C-MRI identifies the emergence of a glycolytic cell population within intermediate-risk human prostate cancer.', 'IL-17B/RB Activation in Pancreatic Stellate Cells Promotes Pancreatic Cancer Metabolism and Growth.']"""

Recent clinical trials of PPV have demonstrated a feasibility of this new therapeutic approach in various types of advanced cancers. For example, a randomized phase II trial for patients with castration resistant prostate cancer showed a possible clinical benefit in the PPV group.

AR is a nuclear receptor whose activity is regulated by a phosphorylation mechanism controlled by hormone and growth factors. Following phosphorylation, AR interacts with many cofactors that closely control its function. Among such cofactors, Pin1 is a peptidyl-prolyl isomerase that is involved in the control of protein phosphorylation and has a prognostic value in prostate cancer. In the present study, we demonstrate that ARSer81 is involved in the interaction with Pin1, and that this interaction is important for the transcriptional activity of AR.

However, the extent to which harms to quality of life resulting from overdiagnosis and treatment counterbalance this benefit is uncertain.  Methods:   On the basis of ERSPC follow-up data, we used Microsimulation Screening Analysis (MISCAN) to predict the number of prostate cancers, treatments, deaths, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained after the introduction of PSA screening. Various screening strategies, efficacies, and quality-of-life assumptions were modeled.  Results:   Per 1000 men of all ages who were followed for their entire life span, we predicted that annual screening of men between the ages of 55 and 69 years would result in nine fewer deaths from prostate cancer (28% reduction), 14 fewer men receiving palliative therapy (35% reduction), and a total of 73 life-years gained (average, 8.4 years per prostate-cancer death avoided). The number of QALYs that were gained was 56 (range, -21 to 97), a reduction of 23% from unadjusted life-years gained. To prevent one prostate-cancer death, 98 men would need to be screened and 5 cancers would need to be detected. Screening of all men between the ages of 55 and 74 would result in more life-years gained (82) but the same number of QALYs (56).  Conclusions:   The benefit of PSA screening was diminished by loss of QALYs owing to postdiagnosis long-term effects.

Methods:   In our phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we stratified 1199 men with castration-resistant prostate cancer after chemotherapy according to the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance-status score and pain intensity. We randomly assigned them, in a 2:1 ratio, to receive oral enzalutamide at a dose of 160 mg per day (800 patients) or placebo (399 patients). The primary end point was overall survival.  Results:   The study was stopped after a planned interim analysis at the time of 520 deaths. The median overall survival was 18.4 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 17.3 to not yet reached) in the enzalutamide group versus 13.6 months (95% CI, 11.3 to 15.8) in the placebo group (hazard ratio for death in the enzalutamide group, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.53 to 0.75; P<0.001). The superiority of enzalutamide over placebo was shown with respect to all secondary end points: the proportion of patients with a reduction in the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level by 50% or more (54% vs. 2%, P<0.001), the soft-tissue response rate (29% vs. 4%, P<0.001), the quality-of-life response rate (43% vs. 18%, P<0.001), the time to PSA progression (8.3 vs. 3.0 months; hazard ratio, 0.25; P<0.001), radiographic progression-free survival (8.3 vs. 2.9 months; hazard ratio, 0.40; P<0.001), and the time to the first skeletal-related event (16.7 vs. 13.3 months; hazard ratio, 0.69; P<0.001).

Results:   After the correction the prostate cases showed shifts up to 3.6 mm toward the US probe, which may explain largely the reported positioning discrepancies in the literature on US systems versus other imaging modalities. Liver cases showed the largest changes in volume of the organ, up to almost 9%, and shifts of the centroids up to more than 6 mm either away or toward the US probe. Breast images showed systematic small shifts of the centroids toward the US probe with a maximum magnitude of 1.3 mm.

Conventional BAO algorithms discussed in previous studies all focused on photon-based therapies. Impact of BAO on proton therapy is important while proton therapy increasingly receives great interests. This study focuses on potential benefits of BAO on intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) that recently began available to clinical cancer treatment.  Methods:   The authors have developed a novel uncertainty incorporated BAO algorithm for IMPT treatment planning in that IMPT plan quality is highly sensitive to uncertainties such as proton range and setup errors. A linear programming was used to optimize robust intensity maps to scenario-based uncertainties for an incident beam angle configuration. Unlike conventional intensity-modulated radiation therapy with photons (IMXT), the search space for IMPT treatment beam angles may be relatively small but optimizing an IMPT plan may require higher computational costs due to larger data size. Therefore, a deterministic local neighborhood search algorithm that only needs a very limited number of plan objective evaluations was used to optimize beam angles in IMPT treatment planning.  Results:   Three prostate cancer cases and two skull base chordoma cases were studied to demonstrate the dosimetric advantages and robustness of optimized beam angles from the proposed BAO algorithm. Two- to four-beam plans were optimized for prostate cases, and two- and three-beam plans were optimized for skull base cases. By comparing plans with conventional two parallel-opposed angles, all plans with optimized angles consistently improved sparing at organs at risks, i.e., rectum and femoral heads for prostate, brainstem for skull base, in either nominal dose distribution or uncertainty-based dose distributions. The efficiency of the BAO algorithm was demonstrated by comparing it with alternative methods including simulated annealing and genetic algorithm. The numbers of IMPT plan objective evaluations required were reduced by up to a factor of 5 while the same optimal angle plans were converged in selected comparisons.  Conclusions:   Uncertainty incorporated BAO may introduce pronounced improvement of IMPT plan quality including dosimetric benefits and robustness over uncertainties, based on the five clinical studies in this paper. In addition, local search algorithms may be more efficient in finding optimal beam angles than global optimization approaches for IMPT BAO.""","""['Wenhua Cao', 'Gino J Lim', 'Andrew Lee', 'Yupeng Li', 'Wei Liu', 'X Ronald Zhu', 'Xiaodong Zhang']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Comparison of linear and nonlinear programming approaches for ""worst case dose"" and ""minmax"" robust optimization of intensity-modulated proton therapy dose distributions.', 'Influence of robust optimization in intensity-modulated proton therapy with different dose delivery techniques.', 'Development of methods for beam angle optimization for IMRT using an accelerated exhaustive search strategy.', 'Reflections on beam configuration optimization for intensity-modulated proton therapy.', 'Treatment planning optimisation in proton therapy.', 'Robust Beam Selection Based on Water Equivalent Thickness Analysis in Passive Scattering Carbon-Ion Radiotherapy for Pancreatic Cancer.', 'Interobserver Variability Prediction of Primary Gross Tumor in a Patient with Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.', 'A Review of Proton Therapy - Current Status and Future Directions.', 'Optimization of Field Design in the Treatment of Rectal Cancer with Intensity Modulated Proton Beam Radiation Therapy: How Many Fields Are Needed to Account for Rectal Distension Uncertainty?', 'Robust Angle Selection in Particle Therapy.']"""

Methods:   We divided the work into two parts. The first part consisted of six in-phantom tests aimed to study the sensitivity of the different analysis methods. Beam fluences, 3D dose distribution, and DVH of an unaltered original plan were compared to those of the delivered plan, in which an error had been intentionally introduced. The second part consisted of comparing gamma analysis with DVH metrics for 17 patient plans from various sites. Beam fluences were measured with the MapCHECK 2 detector, per-beam planar analysis was performed with the MapCHECK software, and 3D gamma analysis and the DVH evaluation were performed using 3DVH software.  Results:   In a per-beam gamma analysis some of the tests yielded false positives or false negatives. However, the 3DVH software correctly described the DVH of the plan which included the error. The measured DVH from the plan with controlled error agreed with the planned DVH within 2% dose or 2% volume. We also found that a gamma criterion of 3%∕3 mm was too lax to detect some of the forced errors. Global analysis masked some problems, while local analysis magnified irrelevant errors at low doses. Small hotspots were missed for all metrics due to the spatial resolution of the detector panel. DVH analysis for patient plans revealed small differences between treatment plan calculations and 3DVH results, with the exception of very small volume structures such as the eyes and the lenses. Target coverage (D(98) and D(95)) of the measured plan was systematically lower than that predicted by the treatment planning system, while other DVH characteristics varied depending on the parameter and organ.  Conclusions:   We found no correlation between the gamma index and the clinical impact of a discrepancy for any of the gamma index evaluation possibilities (global, local, 2D, or 3D). Some of the tests yielded false positives or false negatives in a per-beam gamma analysis. However, they were correctly accounted for in a DVH analysis.

This is due to concern for potential metal interference-related reduction of spatial localization and tracking accuracy. Here we quantify the localization and tracking accuracy of the Calypso system in the presence of inflatable penile prosthesis devices from three most widely used models which account for, essentially, 100% of implants in North America.  Methods:   Phantom studies were first performed to quantify the interference of Calypso localization and tracking accuracy from both varying metal (steel) masses, and from the penile prosthetic devices themselves. The interference of varying steel masses was studied as a function of two factors: (a) the mass and (b) the location of steel material. The Calypso daily quality assurance (QA) phantom with three implanted Beacon(®) transponders was used to measure any aliasing of position that might occur due to metal interference. After confirming the safety of use in phantom, we implanted Calypso Beacon(®) transponders in one patient with a previously implanted AMS Model 700 inflatable penile prosthetic device. For each of the 42 delivered treatment fractions, redundant stereotactic ultrasound (US) image guidance was performed to ensure good agreement between US and Calypso guidance.  Results:   We observed that a steel mass of less than 18 g did not cause any detectable positional aliasing for the Calypso tracking function. The mass of metal material measured to exist in the three penile prosthetic devices studied here (MP35N alloy) was approximately 1 g for each.

However, this therapeutic intervention usually results in the transition to a more aggressive androgen-independent prostate cancer. The elucidation of molecular alterations during the progression to androgen independence is an integral step toward discovering more effective targeted therapies. With respect to identifying crucial mediators of this transition, we compared the proteomes of androgen-independent (PC3, DU145, PPC1, LNCaP-SF, and 22Rv1) and androgen-dependent (LNCaP and VCaP) and/or normal prostate epithelial (RWPE) cell lines using mass spectrometry. We identified more than 100 proteins that were differentially secreted in the androgen-independent cell lines. Of these, Protein S (PROS1) was elevated in the secretomes of all of the androgen-independent prostate cancer cell lines, with no detectable secretion in normal and androgen-dependent cell lines. Using quantitative PCR, we observed significantly higher (p < 0.05) tissue expression levels of PROS1 in prostate cancer samples, further indicating its importance in prostate cancer progression. Similarly, immunohistochemistry analysis revealed elevation of PROS1 in high grade prostate cancer (Gleason grade ≥ 8), and further elevation in castration-resistant metastatic prostate cancer lesions.

Methods:   A registry-based analysis was conducted between 2004 and 2009 of 430 patients who underwent HIFU. Thirty-nine patients received focal salvage therapy for localized recurrence after external beam radiotherapy. Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging studies combined with transperineal template prostate mapping biopsies or transrectal biopsies were used to localize disease. Validated questionnaires were used to assess functional outcomes. Biochemical failure was defined by using both Phoenix criteria (prostate-specific antigen [PSA] nadir plus 2 ng/mL) and Stuttgart criteria (PSA nadir plus 1.2 ng/mL).  Results:   The mean pre-HIFU PSA level was 4.6 ng/mL. The median follow-up was 17 months (interquartile range, 10-29 months). International Index of Erectile Function-5 scores decreased from a median ± standard deviation (SD) of 18 ± 16 to 13 ± 21 at 6 months, demonstrating worsening function.

Components of MetS have emerged as putative risk factors for prostate carcinoma. In this study, we examine the association between three features of the MetS (obesity, hypertension and diabetes) and the risk of biochemical recurrence (BCR) after radical prostatectomy (RP).  Methods:   We examined data from 1428 men in the University of Michigan Prostate Cancer Data Bank who elected to have RP as their primary treatment. We calculated body mass index from patients' weight and height measured at the time of prostate cancer diagnosis. We used the University of Michigan's Electronic Medical Record Search Engine to identify subjects with hypertension and/or diabetes before their prostate cancer diagnosis.  Results:   Of 1428 men who underwent RP, 107 (8%) subsequently developed BCR with a median length of follow-up post-surgery of 3.6 years. Obesity and hypertension were each associated with an increased risk of BCR (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) = 1.37; 95% CI 0.92-2.09 and aHR = 1.51, 95% CI 1.01-2.26), whereas no association was observed between diabetes and BCR (aHR = 0.73; 95% CI 0.40-1.33).  Conclusions:   Obesity and hypertension were each associated with an increased risk for BCR of prostate cancer after RP, independent of age at diagnosis and tumor pathological features.

Methods:   Phase II cohort study of 72 prostate cancer patients without metastatic bone disease. Patients received flutamide 250 mg tid and leuprolide 22.5 mg three monthly depot for the 9-month initial treatment phase (iTREAT), at which point patients ceased therapy providing PSA <4 ng ml(-1) with continued monitoring for further 2 years (POST). AST was recommenced when PSA exceeded pretreatment level or ≥ 20 ng ml(-1). Body composition was assessed using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry at baseline, completion of treatment phase, and 1 and 2 years post treatment phase (months 21 and 33).  Results:   LM decreased by 1.3 kg and FM increased by 2.3 kg (P<0.001) following iTREAT. During the POST period, there were no further adverse effects on LM or FM, but also no recovery to pretreatment levels. Patients who failed to recover testosterone by month 33 experienced a significant increase in FM compared with those who recovered eugonadal levels of testosterone (10 nmol ml(-1); P = 0.019). Change in testosterone was moderately correlated to changes in % FM (r = -0.314, P<0.028) and LM (r = 0.300, P<0.036) during POST phase. Waist circumference progressively increased over time and by 2 years, POST had not recovered to baseline levels.  Conclusions:   Loss of LM and gain in FM during the 9-month iTREAT was not reversed during 2-year POST, although further deterioration was not observed.

Developing effective chemopreventive regimens to alleviate the burden remains a major challenge. Androgen signaling is vital to the development and progression of prostate cancer. Targeting androgen signaling via blocking the production of the potent ligand dihydrotestosterone has been shown to decrease prostate cancer incidence. However, the potential of increasing the incidence of high-grade prostate cancers has been a concern. Mechanisms of disease progression after the intervention may include increased expression of androgen receptor (AR) in prostate tissue and expression of the constitutively active AR splice variants (AR-Vs) lacking the ligand-binding domain. Thus, novel agents targeting the receptor, preferentially both the full-length and AR-Vs, are urgently needed. In the present study, we show that ginsenoside 20(S)-protopanaxadiol-aglycone (PPD) effectively downregulates the expression and activity of both the full-length AR and AR-Vs. The effects of PPD on AR and AR-Vs are manifested by an immediate drop in proteins followed by a reduction in transcripts, attributed to PPD induction of proteasome-mediated degradation and inhibition of the transcription of the AR gene. We further show that although PPD inhibits the growth as well as AR expression and activity in LNCaP xenograft tumors, the morphology and AR expression in normal prostates are not affected. This study is the first to show that PPD suppresses androgen signaling through downregulating both the full-length AR and AR-Vs, and provides strong rationale for further developing PPD as a promising agent for the prevention and/or treatment of prostate cancer.""","""['Bo Cao', 'Xichun Liu', 'Jing Li', 'Shuang Liu', 'Yanfeng Qi', 'Zhenggang Xiong', 'Allen Zhang', 'Thomas Wiese', 'Xueqi Fu', 'Jingkai Gu', 'Paul S Rennie', 'Oliver Sartor', 'Benjamin R Lee', 'Clement Ip', 'Lijuan Zhao', 'Haitao Zhang', 'Yan Dong']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Int J Cancer""","""['Raddeanin A down-regulates androgen receptor and its splice variants in prostate cancer.', '20(S)-protopanaxadiol inhibition of progression and growth of castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Berberine suppresses androgen receptor signaling in prostate cancer.', 'Are androgen receptor variants a substitute for the full-length receptor?', 'Molecular Origin, Expression Regulation, and Biological Function of Androgen Receptor Splicing Variant 7 in Prostate Cancer.', 'Anti-Tumor Effects of Ginsenoside 20(S)-Protopanaxadiol and 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 Combination in Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Anticancer Potential of Raddeanin A, a Natural Triterpenoid Isolated from Anemone raddeana Regel.', 'Natural Compounds in Prostate Cancer Prevention and Treatment: Mechanisms of Action and Molecular Targets.', 'Raddeanin A down-regulates androgen receptor and its splice variants in prostate cancer.', 'A positive role of c-Myc in regulating androgen receptor and its splice variants in prostate cancer.']"""

Materials and methods:   Using a series of morphological approaches, such as transmission electron microscopy, monodansylcadaverine (Sigma®) and GFP-LC3 fluorescence microscopy assay, and Western blot we monitored the autophagic process in 3 pairs of prostate cancer cell lines to study the relationship to androgen receptor signals.  Results:   Androgen receptor knockdown in androgen receptor positive cells, such as LNCaP or CWRrv1 human prostate cancer cells, led to increased autophagy. Adding functional androgen receptor to androgen receptor negative cells, such as PC3 human prostate cancer cells, resulted in decreased autophagy. This suggests that androgen receptor could have a negative role in regulating autophagy. Mechanism dissection indicated that androgen receptor might repress autophagy via modulation of p62 expression. A therapeutic approach of targeting androgen receptor to increase autophagy using the androgen receptor degradation enhancer ASC-J9® suppressed prostate cancer growth.  Conclusions:   Findings provide evidence that the androgen receptor might promote prostate cancer cell growth via autophagy down-regulation. Targeting the androgen receptor via ASC-J9 might lead to tumor suppression via the induction of autophagy. This may represent a new, potential therapeutic approach and mechanism for prostate cancer.""","""['Qi Jiang', 'Shuyuan Yeh', 'Xiaohai Wang', 'Defeng Xu', 'Qiaoxia Zhang', 'Xinquin Wen', 'Shujie Xia', 'Chawnshang Chang']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['The androgen receptor pathway is by-passed in prostate cancer cells generated after prolonged treatment with bicalutamide.', 'Pharmacological targeting of constitutively active truncated androgen receptor by nigericin and suppression of hormone-refractory prostate cancer cell growth.', 'Interleukin-6 undergoes transition from growth inhibitor associated with neuroendocrine differentiation to stimulator accompanied by androgen receptor activation during LNCaP prostate cancer cell progression.', 'Non-genomic effects of the androgen receptor and vitamin D agonist are involved in suppressing invasive phenotype of prostate cancer cells.', 'Could testosterone have a therapeutic role in prostate cancer?', 'Combination of the NRF2 Inhibitor and Autophagy Inhibitor Significantly Inhibited Tumorigenicity of Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Targeting autophagy in prostate cancer: preclinical and clinical evidence for therapeutic response.', 'Rubicon prevents autophagic degradation of GATA4 to promote Sertoli cell function.', 'ASC-J9® suppresses prostate cancer cell proliferation and invasion via altering the ATF3-PTK2 signaling.', 'Androgen receptor antagonist bicalutamide induces autophagy and apoptosis via ULK2 upregulation in human bladder cancer cells.']"""

IGFBP7 hypermethylation is associated with its down-regulation in various carcinomas. In prostate cancer IGFBP7 down-regulation has been widely reported but to our knowledge the mechanisms behind this event are unknown. We performed a denaturing high performance liquid chromatography screening and validation strategy to profile the methylation status of IGFBP7 in prostate cancer.  Materials and methods:   We combined denaturing high performance liquid chromatography and bisulfite sequencing to examine IGFBP7 methylation in a panel of prostate cancer cell lines. Quantitative methylation specific polymerase chain reaction was used to determine methylation levels in prostate tissue specimens of primary prostate cancer, histologically benign prostate adjacent to tumor, high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and benign prostatic hyperplasia. IGFBP7 gene expression was measured by quantitative methylation specific polymerase chain reaction in cell lines and tissue specimens.  Results:   IGFBP7 was methylated in the 4 prostate cancer cell lines DU145, LNCaP, PC-3 and 22RV1. Quantitative methylation specific polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that promoter methylation was associated with decreased IGFBP7 expression. Quantitative methylation specific polymerase chain reaction showed that IGFBP7 methylation was more frequently detected in prostate cancer (60% (31/52)) and high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (40% (6/15)) samples compared to histologically benign prostate adjacent to tumor (10%) and benign prostatic hyperplasia (0%) samples.  Conclusions:   To our knowledge this is the first report of aberrant IGFBP7 promoter hypermethylation and concurrent IGFBP7 gene silencing in prostate cancer cell lines. Results demonstrate that CpG methylation of IGFBP7 may represent a novel biomarker of prostate cancer and pre-invasive neoplasms. Thus, future examination of IGFBP7 methylation and expression in a larger patient cohort, including bodily fluids, is justified to further evaluate its role in a diagnostic and prognostic setting.""","""['Linda Sullivan', 'Therese M Murphy', 'Ciara Barrett', 'Barbara Loftus', 'John Thornhill', 'Mark Lawler', 'Donal Hollywood', 'Thomas Lynch', 'Antoinette S Perry']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['DNA methylation paradigm shift: 15-lipoxygenase-1 upregulation in prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and prostate cancer by atypical promoter hypermethylation.', 'MT1G hypermethylation is associated with higher tumor stage in prostate cancer.', 'In silico mining identifies IGFBP3 as a novel target of methylation in prostate cancer.', 'Common gene pathways and families altered by DNA methylation in breast and prostate cancers.', 'WOMEN IN CANCER THEMATIC REVIEW: Diverse functions of DNA methylation: implications for prostate cancer and beyond.', 'A Boolean-based machine learning framework identifies predictive biomarkers of HSP90-targeted therapy response in prostate cancer.', 'Diagnostic Value of Serum Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 7 (IGFBP7) in Colorectal Cancer.', 'Insulin Growth Factor Binding Protein 7 (IGFBP7)-Related Cancer and IGFBP3 and IGFBP7 Crosstalk.', 'Angiomodulin (IGFBP7) is a cerebral specific angiocrine factor, but is probably not a blood-brain barrier inducer.', 'Serum Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 7 as a Potential Biomarker in the Diagnosis and Prognosis of Esophagogastric Junction Adenocarcinoma.']"""

Methods:   Five-year age-standardised relative survival rates by gender for 11 cancer sites and all cancers combined of patients diagnosed in 1995-1999, were obtained from the Italian Association of Cancer Registries (CRs) database. The SEH variables describe at provincial level macro-economy, demography, labour market, health resources in 1995-2005. A principal components factor analysis was applied to the SEH variables to control their strong mutual correlation. For every considered cancer site, linear regression models were estimated considering the 5-RS% as dependent variable and the principal components factors of the SEH variables as independent variables.  Results:   The model composition was correlated to the characteristics of take in charge of patients. SEH factors were correlated with the observed survival for all cancer combined and colon-rectum in both sexes, prostate, kidney and non Hodgkin's lymphomas in men, breast, corpus uteri and melanoma in women (R(2) from 40% to 85%). In the provinces without any CR the survival was very similar with that of neighbouring provinces with analogous social, economic and health characteristics.

The fibroid pseudocapsule is composed of a neurovascular network rich in neurofibers similar to the neurovascular bundle surrounding a prostate. The nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy has several intriguing parallels to myomectomy. It may serve either as a useful model in modern fibroid surgical removal, or it may accelerate our understanding of the role of the fibrovascular bundle and neurotransmitters in the healing and restoration of reproductive potential after intracapsular myomectomy. Surgical innovations, such as laparoscopic or robotic myomectomy applied to the intracapsular technique with magnification of the fibroid pseudocapsule surrounding a leiomyoma, originated from the radical prostatectomy method that highlighted a careful dissection of the neurovascular bundle to preserve sexual functioning after prostatectomy. Gentle uterine leiomyoma detachment from the pseudocapsule neurovascular bundle has allowed a reduction in uterine bleeding and uterine musculature trauma with sparing of the pseudocapsule neuropeptide fibers. This technique has had a favorable impact on functionality in reproduction and has improved fertility outcomes.

Age, prostate-specific antigen, prostate volume, body mass index, operative time and history of previous abdominal surgery were evaluated. The existence of patent processus vaginalis was also evaluated for the development of postoperative inguinal hernia.  Results:   Postoperative inguinal hernia occurred in 20 out of 410 (4.9%) groins (17/205 patients; 8.3%), and patent processus vaginalis was observed in 49 out of 410 (11.9%) groins. In the normal groin group, inguinal hernia occurred in seven out of 361 (1.9%) groins. However, in the patent processus vaginalis group, it occurred in 13 out of 49 (26.5%) groins. On univariate analysis using Cox proportional hazards model, age, body mass index, history of previous abdominal surgery and patent processus vaginalis were significant risk factors.

Disruption of these vessels can be achieved by inducing vascular endothelial-cell apoptosis. Moreover, endothelial cell apoptosis has been proven to be enhanced by ceramide-increasing drugs. Herein, we introduce a novel therapeutic approach which uses ultrasound-stimulated microbubbles used in combination with radiation to cause a rapid accumulation of ceramide in endothelial cells in-vitro. We also test this modality directly with other cell types as a general method of killing cancer cells. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), acute myeloid leukemia cells (AML), murine fibrosarcoma cells (KHT-C), prostate cancer cells (PC3), breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231) and astrocytes were used to evaluate this mechanism of inducing cell death. Survival was measured by clonogenic assays, and ceramide content was detected using immunohistochemistry. Exposure of cell types to ultrasound-stimulated bubbles alone resulted in increases in ceramide for all cell types and survivals of 12 ± 2%, 65 ± 5%, 83 ± 2%, 58 ± 4%, 58 ± 3%, 18 ± 7% for HUVEC, AML, PC3, MDA, KHT-C and astrocyte cells, respectively. Results from selected cell types involving radiation treatments indicated additive treatment enhancements and increases in intracellular ceramide content one hour after exposure to ultrasound-activated microbubbles and radiation. Endothelial cell survival decreased from 8 ± 1% after 2 Gy of radiation treatment alone and from 12 ± 2% after ultrasound and microbubbles alone, to 1 ± 1% with combined treatment. In Asmase +/+ astrocytes, survival decreased from 56 ± 2% after 2 Gy radiation alone and from 17 ± 7% after ultrasound and microbubbles alone, to 5 ± 2% when combined. Using ASMase deficient astrocytes (Asmase -/- ) and Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), we also demonstrate that ultrasound-activated microbubbles stimulate ASMase activity and ceramide production.

Overexpression of the Bcl-2 family members, including Mcl-1, in PCa cells is known to inhibit intracellular mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis. Here we report the development of a novel transgenic mouse model that spontaneously develops prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and adenocarcinoma by the inducible, conditional knockout of transforming growth factor β receptor type II in stromal fibroblastic cells (Tgfbr2(ColTKO)). The Tgfbr2(ColTKO) prostate epithelia demonstrated down-regulation of luminal and basal differentiation markers, as well as Pten expression and up-regulation of Mcl-1. However, unlike in men, Tgfbr2(ColTKO) prostates exhibited no regression acutely after castration. The administration of Sabutoclax (BI-97C1), a pan-active Bcl-2 protein family antagonist mediated apoptosis in castrate-resistant PCa cells of Tgfbr2(ColTKO) mice and human subcutaneous, orthotopic, and intratibial xenograft PCa models. Interestingly, Sabutoclax had little apoptotic effect on benign prostate tissue in Tgfbr2(ColTKO) and wild-type mice.

We performed differential expression analysis on nine normal prostate tissues and 50 PCa enriched for different ETS rearrangements using exon-level expression microarrays, followed by in vitro validation using cell line models. We found specific deregulation of 57 genes in ERG-positive PCa and 15 genes in ETV1-positive PCa, whereas deregulation of 27 genes was shared in both tumor subtypes. We further showed that the expression of seven tumor-associated ERG target genes (PLA1A, CACNA1D, ATP8A2, HLA-DMB, PDE3B, TDRD1, and TMBIM1) and two tumor-associated ETV1 target genes (FKBP10 and GLYATL2) was significantly affected by specific ETS silencing in VCaP and LNCaP cell line models, respectively, whereas the expression of three candidate ERG and ETV1 shared targets (GRPR, KCNH8, and TMEM45B) was significantly affected by silencing of either ETS. Interestingly, we demonstrate that the expression of TDRD1, the topmost overexpressed gene of our list of ERG-specific candidate targets, is inversely correlated with the methylation levels of a CpG island found at -66 bp of the transcription start site in PCa and that TDRD1 expression is regulated by direct binding of ERG to the CpG island in VCaP cells. We conclude that ETS transcription factors regulate specific and shared target genes and that TDRD1, FKBP10, and GRPR are promising therapeutic targets and can serve as diagnostic markers for molecular subtypes of PCa harboring specific fusion gene rearrangements.""","""['Paula Paulo', 'Franclim R Ribeiro', 'Joana Santos', 'Diana Mesquita', 'Mafalda Almeida', 'João D Barros-Silva', 'Harri Itkonen', 'Rui Henrique', 'Carmen Jerónimo', 'Anita Sveen', 'Ian G Mills', 'Rolf I Skotheim', 'Ragnhild A Lothe', 'Manuel R Teixeira']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Neoplasia""","""[""Potential downstream target genes of aberrant ETS transcription factors are differentially affected in Ewing's sarcoma and prostate carcinoma."", 'ETS transcription factors control transcription of EZH2 and epigenetic silencing of the tumor suppressor gene Nkx3.1 in prostate cancer.', 'Characterization of 1577 primary prostate cancers reveals novel biological and clinicopathologic insights into molecular subtypes.', 'Oncogenic ETS Factors in Prostate Cancer.', 'The oncogenic role of the ETS transcription factors MEF and ERG.', 'The cancer testis antigen TDRD1 regulates prostate cancer proliferation by associating with the snRNP biogenesis machinery.', 'CACNA1D overexpression and voltage-gated calcium channels in prostate cancer during androgen deprivation.', 'The cancer testis antigen TDRD1 regulates prostate cancer proliferation by associating with snRNP biogenesis machinery.', 'Metabolic pathways enriched according to ERG status are associated with biochemical recurrence in Hispanic/Latino patients with prostate cancer.', 'A novel chromatin regulator-related immune checkpoint related gene prognostic signature and potential candidate drugs for endometrial cancer patients.']"""

In this study, we investigated the androgen regulation and functional analysis of 14-3-3ζ in prostate cancer.  Experimental design:   Using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) combined with DNA microarray (ChIP-chip) analysis in LNCaP cells, we identified a functional androgen receptor-binding site in the downstream region of the 14-3-3ζ gene. Androgen regulation was examined by quantitative reverse transcription PCR and Western blot analysis. Prostate cancer cells stably expressing 14-3-3ζ and siRNA knockdown were used for functional analyses. We further examined 14-3-3ζ expression in clinical samples of prostate cancer by immunohistochemistry and quantitative reverse transcription PCR.  Results:   Androgen-dependent upregulation of 14-3-3ζ was validated at the mRNA and protein levels. The 14-3-3ζ gene is favorable for cancer-cell survival, as its ectopic expression in LNCaP cells contributes to cell proliferation and the acquired resistance to etoposide-induced apoptosis. 14-3-3ζ expression was associated with androgen receptor transcriptional activity and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) mRNA expression. Immunoprecipitation indicated that 14-3-3ζ was associated with androgen receptor in the nucleus. Clinicopathologic studies further support the relevance of 14-3-3ζ in prostate cancers, as its higher expression is associated with malignancy and lymph node metastasis.

Methods:   Between April 2004 and December 2007, 239 consecutive men with total PSA levels of 2.0-10.0 ng/mL underwent measurements of PSA, free PSA, and [-2]pro-PSA. We assessed the significance of laboratory-based PSA-related indices including free PSA/total PSA (%f-PSA), p2PSA/free PSA (%p2PSA), p2PSA/%f-PSA, Prostate Health Index (phi, an index combining PSA, free PSA, and p2PSA), total prostate volume (TPV)-adjusted PSA-related indices, including PSA density, %p2PSA density, p2PSA/%f-PSA density, and phi density, and transition zone (TZ) prostate volume-adjusted PSA-related indices such as PSA TZ density (PSATZD), %p2PSA TZD, p2PSA/%fPSA TZD, and phi TZD.  Results:   The positive biopsy rate was 22.2%. When sensitivity was fixed at 95 %, unnecessary biopsies could be avoided in 28% of men when phi was used as a biopsy indication. In cases where total and transition zone prostate volumes were available, the use of %p2PSA density, phi density, p2PSA/%f-PSA TZD, and phi TZD resulted in the avoidance of 48, 47, 54, and 54 % of unnecessary biopsies, respectively, while maintaining a high sensitivity of 90%.  Conclusions:   At 90 and 95 % sensitivity, laboratory-based indices containing p2PSA, particularly phi, showed significantly greater specificity for prostate cancer as compared with %f-PSA.

Clinical trials investigating the therapeutic value of anti-IGF1 receptor (IGF1R) therapies in cancer, including prostate cancer, are ongoing. However, the multiple functions of the IGF network in the prostate are not entirely known. To elucidate the effects of IGF and insulin (INS) on prostate cells, we stimulated prostate cancer (PC3, DU145, LNCaP, DUCaP) and noncancerous prostate cells (EP156T, RWPE-1) and observed differing responses: whereas cancer cells responded to IGF and INS exposure by way of enhanced cell proliferation and glucose consumption, basal to luminal differentiation was induced in noncancerous cells. The same diverse responses were observed when the growth factor receptors IGF1R or INSR were overexpressed. Down-regulation of IGF1R or INSR isoform A (INSRA) also inhibited only proliferation of cancer cells. The proliferative response induced by the INSR in cancer cells was mediated solely by the INSRA. Moreover we observed that the receptors of the IGF network mutually influence their expression and exert redundant functions, thus underscoring the functional molecular network formed by IGF, INS, IGF1R, and INSR. Collectively we found that both IGF1R and INSRA have oncogenic effects in prostate cancer, but the IGF network also has important physiological functions in the noncancerous prostate.

As CAFs are able to recruit endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) to tumor site, we aim to investigate their interplay for prostate carcinoma progression. Both prostate CAFs and cancer cells actively recruit EPCs, known to affect tumor progression through increased vasculogenesis. EPCs synergize with CAFs to further promote epigenetic plasticity of cancer cells, through a mesenchymal-to-amoeboid transition. Indeed, after fibroblasts have engaged epithelial-mesenchymal transition in cancer cells, a further shift towards amoeboid motility is promoted by EPCs through contact-mediated triggering of the bidirectional ephrinA1/EphA2 signaling. The activation of ephrinA1 reverse pathway enhances EPC-induced neo-vascularization, thus promoting tumor growth, while EphA2 forward signaling elicits mesenchymal-amoeboid transition in cancer cells, favoring their adhesion to endothelium, transendothelial migration, and lung metastatic colonization.

Natural killer (NK) cells represent potent antitumor effector cells. They also express TRAIL. Therefore, we investigated whether bortezomib could sensitize tumor cells to NK cell-mediated killing, and have the same effect in human prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP and DU145). We found that bortezomib strongly inhibits proliferation in both cell lines. Furthermore, compared with LNCaP cells, DU145 cells are more sensitive to bortezomib-induced apoptosis. However, bortezomib is unable to sensitize these two cell lines to NK cell-mediated killing in short-term assays. In long-term assays, we found that killing mediated by activated NK cells following bortezomib treatment leads to greater antitumor effects than either treatment alone. In addition, treatment with bortezomib causes these cells to upregulate apoptosis-related mRNA as well as death receptors and downregulate the major histocompatibility class (MHC)-I molecule on the cell surface of DU145 cells. In contrast, LNCaP cells are not sensitized by this treatment. Death receptors and the MHC-I molecule did not change in this cell line. These data suggest that bortezomib can be used to sensitize prostate cancer cells to NK cell-mediated killing and improve current cancer therapies. This therapeutic strategy may be more effective in patients with androgen-insensitive prostate cancer.""","""['Wei Hu', 'Rui-Rui Zheng', 'Hui-Xia Cui', 'Dan Yue', 'Yong Wang', 'You-Hong Jiang']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Asian J Androl""","""['Bortezomib enhances the sensitivity of prostate cancer cells to natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity.', 'Sensitization of tumor cells to NK cell-mediated killing by proteasome inhibition.', 'Sensitization of human breast cancer cells to natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity by proteasome inhibition.', 'Bortezomib and depsipeptide sensitize tumors to tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand: a novel method to potentiate natural killer cell tumor cytotoxicity.', 'Sensitizing tumor cells to immune-mediated cytotoxicity.', 'Genistein Sensitizes Human Cholangiocarcinoma Cell Lines to Be Susceptible to Natural Killer Cells.', 'Synergistic Effects of Cabozantinib and EGFR-Specific CAR-NK-92 Cells in Renal Cell Carcinoma.', 'Modulatory effects of bortezomib on host immune cell functions.', 'High-throughput transcriptomic analysis nominates proteasomal genes as age-specific biomarkers and therapeutic targets in prostate cancer.', 'Investigation of anti-cancer mechanisms by comparative analysis of naked mole rat and rat.']"""

Telomerase-the enzyme responsible for immortalizing cells through the addition of telomeric repeats-is de-repressed early in an aspiring cancer cell. Here the effects of biologically-relevant concentrations and short incubations (1-16 h) of perillyl alcohol or the mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin, on telomerase activity were examined in prostate cancer cell lines. A rapid suppression of telomerase activity was observed (from ∼65% to >95%) determined by real-time quantitative telomerase repeat amplification protocol and confirmed by polyacrylamide gel-analysis. Using real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR, we demonstrated that human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) mRNA levels were unaltered. Western blot analysis revealed that hTERT protein levels decreased in response to perillyl alcohol or rapamycin. This decrease was partially blocked by pretreatment with a proteasome inhibitor MG-132, indicating that proteasomal degradation contributed to the loss of hTERT protein. No change in hTERT phosphorylation at Ser824 was observed, indicating the absence of cellular hTERT protein redistribution.

We evaluated the relationship between the rate of adenoma detection by flexible sigmoidoscopy and interval distal colorectal cancer.  Methods:   We analyzed data from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer screening trial, which used flexible sigmoidoscopy as a colorectal cancer screening modality (46,835 subjects; 66,711 examinations by 93 examiners). An adenoma detection rate was defined for each examiner as the number of examinations that identified adenomas (confirmed by pathology analysis) divided by the total number of screening examinations. Interval cancers were defined as cancers presumed detectable but not detected, which was based on the stage at diagnosis and the elapsed time from screening to diagnosis.  Results:   The Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer study identified 32 interval distal cancers. The incidence of interval cancer for individuals screened by examiners in the lowest quartile of distal adenoma detection (2.0%-7.2%) was 9.0/10,000 examinations, whereas the incidence of interval cancers was lower among individuals whose examiners were in higher quartiles of adenoma detection, ranging from 3.0 to 5.4/10,000 examinations. The odds of interval distal cancer were significantly increased for patients of examiners in the lowest quartile of distal adenoma detection (<7.2%), with an adjusted odds ratio of 2.4 (95% confidence interval, 1.1-5.0; P = .02).

Design, settings, and participants:   From June 2005 until November 2011, 56 PCa patients with biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy underwent bilateral pelvic and/or retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy based on a positive 18F-FEC PET/CT scan.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The findings of PET/CT were compared with the histologic results.  Results and limitations:   Median PSA value at the time of 18F-FEC PET/CT analysis was 6.0 ng/ml (interquartile range: 1.7-9.4 ng/ml). In 48 of 56 (85.7%) patients with positive 18F-FEC PET/CT findings, histologic examination confirmed the presence of PCa LNMs. Of 1149 lymph nodes that were removed and histologically evaluated, 282 (24.5%) harbored metastasis.

We determined whether erectile function decreases with the number of biopsies experienced.  Materials and methods:   During a median 3.2-year followup after prostate cancer diagnosis in 2003 to 2010 at our institution 427 men on active surveillance underwent a total of 1,197 biopsies and provided 1,398 erectile function evaluations via the Sexual Health Inventory for Men questionnaire. For analysis we decomposed the 25-point questionnaire responses into a 5-point erectile function score and a 3-level sexual activity status. We used separate models adjusted for patient characteristics to determine whether either outcome varied with biopsy exposure.  Results:   At diagnosis the median age was 61 years and median prostate specific antigen was 5.3 ng/ml. Of the cases 70% were clinical stage cT1 and 93% were Gleason score less than 7. Of biopsies followed by evaluations 40% were the first undergone by the patient and 9% were the fifth to ninth. At the first erectile function evaluation 15% of men were inactive, 8% engage in stimulation and 77% engaged in intercourse. Sexual activity level changed in greater than 20% of respondents between evaluations. Adjusted erectile function scores were not associated with biopsy exposure cross-sectionally or longitudinally but they corresponded with the 50th, 63rd and 80th percentiles of erectile function by increasing sexual activity level. Similarly, sexual activity was not associated with biopsy exposure. Separated outcomes were more accurate and informative than Sexual Health Inventory for Men scores.  Conclusions:   Our study had high power to detect erectile function-biopsy associations but it estimated that the effects were negligible.

Results:   Of 105,972 patients 81,112 (76.5%) were white, 14,006 (13.2%) were black, 6,999 (6.6%) were Hispanic and 3,855 (3.6%) were all other. In mixed effects multivariate models, black men had markedly lower use of high volume hospitals (OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.70-0.76) and surgeons (OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.64-0.70) compared to white men. Black men also had higher odds of blood transfusion (OR 1.08, 95% CI 1.01-1.14), longer length of stay (OR 1.07, 95% CI 1.06-1.07) and inpatient mortality (OR 1.73, 95% CI 1.02-2.92).

Objective:   To evaluate the influence of solitary PSMs (sPSMs) and multiple PSMs (mPSMs) on important clinical end points.  Design, setting, and participants:   Data from 1712 patients from the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Québec with pT2-4 N0 prostate cancer (PCa) and undetectable prostate-specific antigen after RP were analyzed.  Intervention:   RP without neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Kaplan-Meier analysis estimated survival functions, and Cox proportional hazards models addressed predictors of clinical end points.  Results and limitations:   Median follow-up was 74.9 mo. A total of 1121 patients (65.5%) were margin-negative, 281 patients (16.4%) had sPSMs, and 310 patients (18.1%) had mPSMs. A total of 280 patients (16.4%) experienced BCR, and 197 patients (11.5%) were treated with salvage radiotherapy (SRT). Sixty-eight patients (4.0%) received definitive androgen deprivation therapy, 19 patients (1.1%) developed metastatic disease, and 15 patients (0.9%) had castration-resistant PCa (CRPC). Thirteen patients (0.8%) died from PCa, and 194 patients (11.3%) died from other causes. Ten-year Kaplan-Meier estimates for BCR-free survival were 82% for margin-negative patients, 72% for patients with sPSMs, and 59% for patients with mPSMs (p<0.0001). Time to metastatic disease, CRPC, PCa-specific mortality (PCSM), or all-cause mortality did not differ significantly among the three groups (p=0.991, p=0.988, p=0.889, and p=0.218, respectively). On multivariable analysis, sPSMs and mPSMs were associated with BCR (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.711; p=0.001 and HR: 2.075; p<0.0001), but sPSMs and mPSMs could not predict metastatic disease (p=0.705 and p=0.242), CRPC (p=0.705 and p=0.224), PCSM (p=0.972 and p=0.260), or all-cause death (p=0.102 and p=0.067). The major limitation was the retrospective design.  Conclusions:   In a cohort of patients who received early SRT in 70% of cases upon BCR, sPSMs and mPSMs predicted BCR but not long-term clinical end points. Adjuvant radiotherapy for margin-positive patients might not be justified, as only a minority of patients progressed to end points other than BCR.

Objective:   To evaluate the effect of a risk-stratified grade of NS technique on early return of urinary continence.  Design, setting, and participants:   Data were collected from 1546 patients who underwent RALP by a single surgeon at a tertiary care center from December 2008 to October 2011. Patients were categorized preoperatively by a risk-stratified approach into risk grades 1-4, with risk grade 1 patients more likely to receive NS grade 1 or complete hammock preservation. This categorization was also conducted for risk grades 2-4, with grade 4 patients receiving a non-NS procedure.  Intervention:   Risk-stratified grading of NS RALP.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Univariate and multivariate analysis identified predictors of early return of urinary continence, defined as no pad use at ≤ 12 wk postoperatively.  Results and limitations:   Early return of continence was achieved by 791 of 1417 men (55.8%); of those, 199 of 277 (71.8%) were in NS grade 1, 440 of 805 (54.7%) were in NS grade 2, 132 of 289 (45.7%) were in NS grade 3, and 20 of 46 (43.5%) were in NS grade 4 (p<0.001). On multivariate analysis, better NS grade was a significant independent predictor of early return of urinary continence when NS grade 1 was the reference variable compared with NS grade 2 (p<0.001; odds ratio [OR]: 0.46), NS grade 3 (p<0.001; OR: 0.35), and NS grade 4 (p=0.001; OR: 0.29). Lower preoperative International Prostate Symptom Score (p=0.001; OR: 0.97) and higher preoperative Sexual Health Inventory for Men score (p=0.002; OR: 1.03) were indicative of early return of urinary continence. Positive surgical margin rates were 7.2% (20 of 277) of grade 1 cases, 7.6% (61 of 805) of grade 2 cases, 7.6% (22 of 289) of grade 3 cases, and 17.4% (8 of 46) of grade 4 cases (p=0.111). Extraprostatic extension occurred in 6.1% (17 of 277) of NS grade 1 cases, 17.5% (141 of 805) of NS grade 2 cases, 42.5% (123 of 289) of NS grade 3 cases, and 63% (29 of 46) of NS grade 4 cases (p<0.001). Some limitations of the study are that the study was not randomized, grading of NS was subjective, and possible selection bias existed.

The definition of index lesion volume is important for appropriate decision making, especially for image guided focal treatment. We determined the accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging for determining index tumor volume compared with volumes derived from histopathology.  Materials and methods:   We evaluated 135 patients (mean age 59.3 years) with a mean prostate specific antigen of 6.74 ng/dl who underwent multiparametric 3T endorectal coil magnetic resonance imaging of the prostate and subsequent radical prostatectomy. Index tumor volume was determined prospectively and independently by magnetic resonance imaging and histopathology. The ellipsoid formula was applied to determine histopathology tumor volume, whereas manual tumor segmentation was used to determine magnetic resonance tumor volume. Histopathology tumor volume was correlated with age and prostate specific antigen whereas magnetic resonance tumor volume involved Pearson correlation and linear regression methods. In addition, the predictive power of magnetic resonance tumor volume, prostate specific antigen and age for estimating histopathology tumor volume (greater than 0.5 cm(3)) was assessed by ROC analysis. The same analysis was also conducted for the 1.15 shrinkage factor corrected histopathology data set.  Results:   There was a positive correlation between histopathology tumor volume and magnetic resonance tumor volume (Pearson coefficient 0.633, p <0.0001), but a weak correlation between prostate specific antigen and histopathology tumor volume (Pearson coefficient 0.237, p = 0.003). On linear regression analysis histopathology tumor volume and magnetic resonance tumor volume were correlated (r(2) = 0.401, p <0.00001). On ROC analysis AUC values for magnetic resonance tumor volume, prostate specific antigen and age in estimating tumors larger than 0.5 cm(3) at histopathology were 0.949 (p <0.0000001), 0.685 (p = 0.001) and 0.627 (p = 0.02), respectively. Similar results were found in the analysis with shrinkage factor corrected tumor volumes at histopathology.  Conclusions:   Magnetic resonance imaging can accurately estimate index tumor volume as determined by histology. Magnetic resonance imaging has better accuracy in predicting histopathology tumor volume in tumors larger than 0.5 cm(3) than prostate specific antigen and age. Index tumor volume as determined by magnetic resonance imaging may be helpful in planning treatment, specifically in identifying tumor margins for image guided focal therapy and possibly selecting better active surveillance candidates.""","""['Baris Turkbey', 'Haresh Mani', 'Omer Aras', 'Ardeshir R Rastinehad', 'Vijay Shah', 'Marcelino Bernardo', 'Thomas Pohida', 'Dagane Daar', 'Compton Benjamin', 'Yolanda L McKinney', 'W Marston Linehan', 'Bradford J Wood', 'Maria J Merino', 'Peter L Choyke', 'Peter A Pinto']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Targeted prostate biopsy: opportunities and challenges in the era of multiparametric prostate magnetic resonance imaging.', 'Editorial comment.', 'Comparison of semi-automated and manual methods to measure the volume of prostate cancer on magnetic resonance imaging.', 'Fully automated prostate segmentation on MRI: comparison with manual segmentation methods and specimen volumes.', 'Tumor target volume for focal therapy of prostate cancer-does multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging allow for a reliable estimation?', 'Multiparametric 3T prostate magnetic resonance imaging to detect cancer: histopathological correlation using prostatectomy specimens processed in customized magnetic resonance imaging based molds.', 'Rückblick: Doppel-Workshop „Prostata 2021“ zur MRT-Bildgebung in der\xa0Praxis.', 'Preoperative imaging accuracy in size determination of prostate cancer in men undergoing radical prostatectomy for clinically localised disease.', 'PI-RADS 3 lesions: a critical review and discussion of how to improve management.', 'Prostate MRI for Improving Personalized Risk Prediction of Incontinence and Surgical Planning: The Role of Membranous Urethral Length Measurements and the Use of 3D Models.', 'HoloLens augmented reality system for transperineal free-hand prostate procedures.', 'A Comparative Study of Multiparametric MRI Sequences in Measuring Prostate Cancer Index Lesion Volume.']"""

Total and free prostate specific antigen, percent free-to-total prostate specific antigen, [-2]proPSA and the prostate health index [([-2]proPSA/free prostate specific antigen) × √total prostate specific antigen)] were determined. Logistic regression models were fitted to test prostate cancer predictors. Predictive accuracy estimates of biopsy outcome predictions were quantified. Regression coefficients were used to create a decision making tool to predict prostate cancer. A calibration plot was used to evaluate the extent of overestimating or underestimating the observed prostate cancer rate. Decision curve analysis provided an estimate of the net benefit obtained using the prostate health index based nomogram.  Results:   Overall 280 of 729 patients (38.4%) were diagnosed with prostate cancer at extended prostate biopsy. On accuracy analyses prostate health index emerged as the most informative predictor of prostate cancer (AUC 0.70) compared to established predictors, such as total prostate specific antigen (0.51) and percent free-to-total prostate specific antigen (0.62). Including the prostate health index in a multivariable logistic regression model based on patient age, prostate volume, digital rectal examination and biopsy history significantly increased predictive accuracy by 7% from 0.73 to 0.80 (p <0.001).

Materials and methods:   Patients with locally advanced prostate cancer, recruited from 1999 to 2002, were randomized to primary cryoablation or external beam radiotherapy. All patients received neoadjuvant hormonal therapy for 3 months before and 3 months after the procedures. Patients underwent followup transrectal ultrasound guided biopsy (at 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months for cryoablation, and at 18 and 24 months for external beam radiotherapy) and as clinically indicated thereafter. Biochemical failure was based on the Phoenix criterion (prostate specific antigen nadir +2 ng/dl).  Results:   A total of 62 patients completed the trial. Median followup was 105.2 months (SD ±35.8). Accrual was limited due to newer data favoring longer neoadjuvant hormonal therapy and higher external beam radiotherapy dose for locally advanced prostate cancer. There was a greater reduction in prostate volume in the cryoablation group after intervention (-54% vs -34%, p ≤0.01). Disease specific survival and overall survival were comparable between the groups. However, the 8-year biochemical disease-free survival rate was significantly lower in the cryoablation group (17.4% vs 59.1%) (p = 0.01).  Conclusions:   This randomized trial with median followup approaching 9 years showed that cryoablation was inferior in attaining biochemical disease-free survival in patients with locally advanced prostate cancer (cT2c-T3).

Less is known about the usefulness of this marker in following patients with prostate cancer on active surveillance. Thus, we examined the relationship between [-2]proPSA and biopsy results in men enrolled in an active surveillance program.  Materials and methods:   In 167 men from our institutional active surveillance program we used Cox proportional hazards models to examine the relationship between [-2]proPSA and annual surveillance biopsy results. The outcome of interest was biopsy reclassification (Gleason score 7 or greater, more than 2 positive biopsy cores or more than 50% involvement of any core with cancer). We also examined the association of biopsy results with total prostate specific antigen, %fPSA, [-2]proPSA/%fPSA and the Beckman Coulter Prostate Health Index phi ([-2]proPSA/free prostate specific antigen) × (total prostate specific antigen)(½)).  Results:   While on active surveillance (median time from diagnosis 4.3 years), 63 (37.7%) men demonstrated biopsy reclassification based on the previously mentioned criteria, including 28 (16.7%) of whom had reclassification based on Gleason score upgrading (Gleason score 7 or greater). Baseline and longitudinal %fPSA, %[-2]proPSA, [-2]proPSA/%fPSA and phi measurements were significantly associated with biopsy reclassification, and %[-2]proPSA and phi provided the greatest predictive accuracy for high grade cancer.  Conclusions:   In men on active surveillance, measures based on [-2]proPSA such as phi appear to provide improved prediction of biopsy reclassification during followup. Additional validation is warranted to determine whether clinically useful thresholds can be defined, and to better characterize the role of %[-2]proPSA and phi in conjunction with other markers in monitoring patients enrolled in active surveillance.""","""['Jeffrey J Tosoian', 'Stacy Loeb', 'Zhaoyong Feng', 'Sumit Isharwal', 'Patricia Landis', 'Debra J Elliot', 'Robert Veltri', 'Jonathan I Epstein', 'Alan W Partin', 'H Ballentine Carter', 'Bruce Trock', 'Lori J Sokoll']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['-2pro-prostate specific antigen as an aid in prostate biopsy.', 'ProPSA and diagnostic biopsy tissue DNA content combination improves accuracy to predict need for prostate cancer treatment among men enrolled in an active surveillance program.', 'Pro-prostate-specific antigen measurements in serum and tissue are associated with treatment necessity among men enrolled in expectant management for prostate cancer.', 'ProPSA and the Prostate Health Index as predictive markers for aggressiveness in low-risk prostate cancer-results from an international multicenter study.', 'From prostate-specific antigen (PSA) to precursor PSA (proPSA) isoforms: a review of the emerging role of proPSAs in the detection and management of early prostate cancer.', 'Evaluation of -2 proPSA and Prostate Health Index (phi) for the detection of prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Is Active Surveillance Too Active?', 'Impact of Prostate Health Index Results for Prediction of Biopsy Grade Reclassification During Active Surveillance.', 'Biomarker in Active Surveillance for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review.', 'Active surveillance for prostate cancer.', 'Computer Extracted Features from Initial H&E Tissue Biopsies Predict Disease Progression for Prostate Cancer Patients on Active Surveillance.']"""

Materials and methods:   From 1997 to 2007, 318 men with cT1c, prostate specific antigen less than 15 ng/ml, Gleason 3 + 4 or less prostate cancer received magnetic resonance imaging guided brachytherapy in which only the peripheral zone was targeted. To exclude benign prostate specific antigen increases due to prostatic hyperplasia, we investigated the usefulness of defining prostate specific antigen failure as nadir +2 with prostate specific antigen velocity greater than 0.75 ng/ml per year. Cox regression was used to determine the factors associated with prostate specific antigen failure.  Results:   Median followup was 5.1 years (maximum 12.1). While 36 patients met the nadir +2 criteria, 16 of 17 biopsy proven local recurrences were among the 26 men who also had a prostate specific antigen velocity greater than 0.75 ng/ml per year (16 of 26 vs 1 of 10, p = 0.008). Using the nadir +2 definition, prostate specific antigen failure-free survival for low risk cases at 5 and 8 years was 95.1% (91.0-97.3) and 80.4% (70.7-87.1), respectively. This rate improved to 95.6% (91.6-97.7) and 90.0% (82.6-94.3) using nadir +2 with prostate specific antigen velocity greater than 0.75 ng/ml per year. For intermediate risk cases survival was 73.0% (55.0-84.8) at 5 years and 66.4% (44.8-81.1) at 8 years (the same values as using nadir +2 with prostate specific antigen velocity greater than 0.75 ng/ml per year).  Conclusions:   Requiring a prostate specific antigen velocity greater than 0.75 ng/ml per year in addition to nadir +2 appears to better predict clinical failure after therapies that target less than the whole gland. Further followup will determine whether magnetic resonance imaging guided brachytherapy targeting the peripheral zone produces comparable cancer control to whole gland treatment in men with low risk disease.

We ascertained whether the knowledge of KLK3 genetics would enhance prostate specific antigen diagnostic performance in patients with clinical suspicion of prostate cancer.  Materials and methods:   We studied 1,058 men who consecutively underwent prostate biopsy for clinical suspicion of prostate cancer. At histology prostate cancer was present in 401 cases and absent in 657. Serum total prostate specific antigen and the free-to-total prostate specific antigen ratio were determined. Four polymorphisms of the KLK3 gene (rs2569733, rs2739448, rs925013 and rs2735839) and 1 polymorphism of the SRD5A2 gene (rs523349) were studied. The influence of genetics on prostate specific antigen variability was evaluated by multivariate linear regression analysis. The performance of total prostate specific antigen and the free-to-total prostate specific antigen ratio alone or combined with a genetically based patient classification were defined by ROC curve analyses.  Results:   For prostate cancer diagnosis the free-to-total prostate specific antigen ratio index alone (cutoff 11%) was superior to total prostate specific antigen (cutoff 4 ng/ml) and to free-to-total prostate specific antigen ratio reflex testing (positive predictive value 61%, 43% and 54%, respectively). Prostate specific antigen correlated with KLK3 genetics (rs2735839 polymorphism p = 0.001, and rs2569733, rs2739448 and rs925013 haplotype combination p = 0.003). In patients with different KLK3 genetics 2 optimal free-to-total prostate specific antigen ratio cutoffs (11% and 14.5%) were found. For free-to-total prostate specific antigen ratio values between 11% and 14.5% the prostate cancer probability ranged from 30.0% to 47.4% according to patient genetics.  Conclusions:   The free-to-total prostate specific antigen ratio is superior to total prostate specific antigen for prostate cancer diagnosis, independent of total prostate specific antigen results. Free-to-total prostate specific antigen ratio findings below 11% are positively associated with prostate cancer and those above 14.5% are negatively associated with prostate cancer, while the interpretation of those between 11% and 14.5% is improved by patient KLK3 genetic analysis.""","""['Carlo-Federico Zambon', 'Tommaso Prayer-Galetti', 'Daniela Basso', 'Andrea Padoan', 'Elisa Rossi', 'Silvia Secco', 'Michela Pelloso', 'Paola Fogar', 'Filippo Navaglia', 'Stefania Moz', 'Filiberto Zattoni', 'Mario Plebani']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Association between KLK3 rs2735839 G/A polymorphism and serum PSA levels in Japanese men.', 'The prostate cancer susceptibility variant rs2735839 near KLK3 gene is associated with aggressive prostate cancer and can stratify gleason score 7 patients.', 'Search for genetic factor association with cancer-free prostate-specific antigen level elevation on the basis of a genome-wide association study in the Korean population.', 'Association of gene polymorphisms of KLK3 and prostate cancer: A meta-analysis.', 'KLK3 in the Regulation of Angiogenesis-Tumorigenic or Not?', 'KLK3 SNP-SNP interactions for prediction of prostate cancer aggressiveness.', 'Identification of potential biomarkers and pivotal biological pathways for prostate cancer using bioinformatics analysis methods.', 'Discovery of Bladder Cancer-related Genes Using Integrative Heterogeneous Network Modeling of Multi-omics Data.', 'Integrative genomic analysis for the discovery of biomarkers in prostate cancer.']"""

The Pareto front represents all optimal possible tradeoffs among several conflicting criteria and is an ideal tool with which to study the possibilities of a given treatment technique. The framework should require minimal user interaction and should resemble and be applicable to daily clinical practice.  Methods and materials:   To generate the Pareto fronts, we used the native scripting language of Pinnacle(3) (Philips Healthcare, Andover, MA). The framework generates thousands of plans automatically from which the Pareto front is generated. As an example, the framework is applied to compare intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) with volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) for prostate cancer patients. For each patient and each technique, 3000 plans are generated, resulting in a total of 60,000 plans. The comparison is based on 5-dimensional Pareto fronts.  Results:   Generating 3000 plans for 10 patients in parallel requires on average 96 h for IMRT and 483 hours for VMAT. Using VMAT, compared to IMRT, the maximum dose of the boost PTV was reduced by 0.4 Gy (P=.074), the mean dose in the anal sphincter by 1.6 Gy (P=.055), the conformity index of the 95% isodose (CI(95%)) by 0.02 (P=.005), and the rectal wall V(65 Gy) by 1.1% (P=.008).

Prognostic markers that can identify aggressive prostate cancer in early stages and help select appropriate therapy to finally reduce the mortality are therefore urgently needed. It has been suggested that stem cells in the prostate gland have a role in initiation, progression, and metastasis of cancer, although controversy continues to exist. Maintenance of normal stem cell or reserve cell populations in several epithelia including prostate has been shown to be regulated by p63 and alteration of p63 expression is considered to have an oncogenic role in prostate cancer. We hypothesize that the expression of cytoplasmic aberrance of p63 is associated with high ALDH1A1 expression as a cancer stem cell marker, thus leading to progression of prostate cancer.  Methods:   Using a cross-sectional study during two years (2009-2010), a total of 79 paraffin embedded tissues of benign prostatic hyperplasia, PIN prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, low and high Gleason score prostate cancer were investigated using immunohistochemistry. Associations between cytoplasmic p63 and ALDH1A1, as well as with pathological diagnosis, were analyzed by Chi-Square test using SPSS 15.0. Links of both markers with cell proliferation rate (KI-67) and apoptotic rate (cleaved caspase 3) were also analyzed by Kruskal-Wallis test.  Results:   The mean age of patient at the diagnosis is 70.0 years. Cytoplasmic aberrance of p63 was associated with ALDH1A1 expression (p<0.001) and both were found to have significant relationships with pathological diagnosis (including Gleason score), (p=0.006 and p<0.001 respectively). Moreover, it was also found that higher levels of cytoplasmic p63 were significantly associated with the frequency of proliferating cells and cells undergoing apoptosis in prostate cancers (p=0.001 and p=0.016 respectively).  Conclusion:   p63 cytoplasmic aberrance is associated with high ALDH1A1 expression.

The variables required to compute DALYs are however multiple and not readily available in many countries. We propose a methodology that derives global DALYs and validate variables and DALYs based on data from various cancer registries.  Methods:   We estimated DALYs for four countries (Norway, Bulgaria, India and Uganda) within each category of the human development index (HDI). The following sources (indicators) were used: Globocan2008 (incidence and mortality), various cancer registries (proportion cured, proportion treated and duration of disease), treatment guidelines (duration of treatment), specific burden of disease studies (sequelae and disability weights), alongside expert opinion. We obtained country-specific population estimates and identified resource levels using the HDI, DALYs are computed as the sum of years of life lost and years lived with disabilities.  Results:   Using mortality:incidence ratios to estimate country-specific survival, and by applying the human development index we derived country-specific estimates of the proportion cured and the proportion treated. The fit between the estimates and observed data from the cancer registries was relatively good. The final DALY estimates were similar to those computed using observed values in Norway, and in WHO's earlier global burden of disease study. Marked cross-country differences in the patterns of DALYs by cancer sites were observed. In Norway and Bulgaria, breast, colorectal, prostate and lung cancer were the main contributors to DALYs, representing 54% and 45%, respectively, of the totals. These cancers contributed only 27% and 18%, respectively, of total DALYs in India and Uganda.  Conclusions:   Our approach resulted in a series of variables that can be used to estimate country-specific DALYs, enabling global estimates of DALYs and international comparisons that support priorities in cancer control.""","""['Isabelle Soerjomataram', 'Joannie Lortet-Tieulent', 'Jacques Ferlay', 'David Forman', 'Colin Mathers', 'D Maxwell Parkin', 'Freddie Bray']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""BMC Med Res Methodol""","""['Global burden of cancer in 2008: a systematic analysis of disability-adjusted life-years in 12 world regions.', 'The burden of cancers and their variations across the states of India: the Global Burden of Disease Study 1990-2016.', 'Burden of disease due to cancer in Spain.', 'Global burden of disease in young people aged 10-24 years: a systematic analysis.', 'The burden of cancer in member countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).', 'Bridging the gap: an economic case study of the impact and cost effectiveness of comprehensive healthcare intermediaries in rural Mexico.', 'Adjusting for comorbidity in incidence-based DALY calculations: an individual-based modeling approach.', 'Advocating an attack against severe malaria: a cost-effectiveness analysis.', 'A clinical trial of group-based body psychotherapy to improve bodily disturbances in post-treatment cancer patients in combination with randomized controlled smartphone-triggered bodily interventions (KPTK): study protocol.', 'Long-Term Clinical Outcomes of Radical Prostatectomy versus Watchful Waiting in Localized Prostate Cancer Patients: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.']"""

AND WHAT DOES THE STUDY ADD?: Incremental nerve-sparing techniques (NSTs) improve postoperative erectile function after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP). However, there are no studies to date that histologically confirm the surgeon intended NST. Thus, in the present study, we histologically confirmed that the surgeon performed the nerve preservation as his intended NSTs during RARP. Also, we found that there was more variability in fascia width outcome on the left side compared with the right. Therefore, when performing nerve preservation on the surgeon's non-dominant side, we need to pay more close attention.  Objectives:   To confirm that the surgeon achieved true intended histological nerve sparing during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) by studying RP specimens. To aid the novice robotic surgeon to develop the skills of RARP.  Patients and methods:   Between June 2008 and May 2009, 122 consecutive patients underwent RARP by a single surgeon (K.K.B.). The degree of nerve sparing (wide resection [WR], interfascial nerve sparing [ITE-NS], intrafascial nerve sparing [ITR-NS]) on both sides was recorded. The posterior sectors of RP specimens from distal, mid, and proximal parts were evaluated. Fascia width (FW) of each position in RP specimens were compared across nerve-sparing types (NSTs). FW was recorded at 15 ° intervals (3-9 o'clock position), measured as the distance between the outermost prostate gland and surgical margin. The slides were reviewed by an experienced uropathologist who was 'blinded' to the NST.  Results:   In all, 93 men were included. The overall mean (sd) FW was the greatest in the order of WR, ITE-NS, and ITR-NS, at 2.42 (1.62), 1.71 (1.40) and 1.16 (1.08) mm, respectively (P < 0.001). FW was statistically significantly correlated with the surgical technique used. When the surgeon intended to perform various levels of nerve sparing, these were reflected in the FW. Interestingly, the left-side FW showed more variability than the right side. We suspect that this was a result of the surgeon's right-hand dominance. Erectile function (EF) recovery rate according to NST was 88.9%, 77.3%, 65.6%, 56.3%, and 0% in bilateral ITR-NS, ITR-NS/ITE-NS, bilateral ITE-NS, ITE-NS/WR, and bilateral WR, respectively. To further validate and confirm these preliminary findings, additional studies involving multicentre cohorts would be required.  Conclusions:   The surgeon intended dissection and FW correlate, with ITR-NS providing the narrowest FW and the EF recovery rate was the highest in bilateral ITR-NS. There was more variability in FW outcome on the left side than the right. The novice robotic surgeon should consider this variability when performing RARP. It may have implications for technique improvement on nerve preservation for EF.""","""['Woo Jin Ko', 'Gregory W Hruby', 'Andrew T Turk', 'Jaime Landman', 'Ketan K Badani']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Pathological confirmation of nerve-sparing types performed during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP).', 'Cavernosal nerve preservation during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy is a graded rather than an all-or-none phenomenon: objective demonstration by assessment of residual nerve tissue on surgical specimens.', 'Anatomical grades of nerve sparing: a risk-stratified approach to neural-hammock sparing during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP).', 'Stepwise approach for nerve sparing without countertraction during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: technique and outcomes.', 'Current status of various neurovascular bundle-sparing techniques in robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Balancing continence function and oncological outcomes during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP).', 'Oncological safety of intrafascial nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy compared with conventional process: a pooled review and meta-regression analysis based on available studies.', ""Intrafascial nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy improves patients' postoperative continence recovery and erectile function: A pooled analysis based on available literatures."", 'Intrafascial versus interfascial nerve sparing in radical prostatectomy for localized prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Prevention and management of post prostatectomy erectile dysfunction.', 'Histological evaluation of nerve sparing technique in robotic assisted radical prostatectomy.']"""

Here we show that adult endothelial cells provide critical signals for the selective growth and differentiation of macrophages from several hematopoietic progenitors. The process features the formation of well-organized colonies that exhibit progressive differentiation from the center to the periphery and toward an M2-like phenotype, characterized by enhanced expression of Tie2 and CD206/Mrc1. These colonies are long-lived depending on the contact with the endothelium; removal of the endothelial monolayer results in rapid colony dissolution. We further found that Csf1 produced by the endothelium is critical for the expansion of the macrophage colonies and that blockade of Csf1 receptor impairs colony growth. Functional analyses indicate that these macrophages are capable of accelerating angiogenesis, promoting tumor growth, and effectively engaging in tight associations with endothelial cells in vivo. These findings uncover a critical role of endothelial cells in the induction of macrophage differentiation and their ability to promote further polarization toward a proangiogenic phenotype. This work also highlights some of the molecules underlying the M2-like differentiation, a process that is relevant to the progression of both developmental and pathologic angiogenesis.""","""['Huanhuan He', 'Jingying Xu', 'Carmen M Warren', 'Dan Duan', 'Xinmin Li', 'Lily Wu', 'M Luisa Iruela-Arispe']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Blood""","""['Prostate cancer-derived cathelicidin-related antimicrobial peptide facilitates macrophage differentiation and polarization of immature myeloid progenitors to protumorigenic macrophages.', 'Prostate cancer-derived CCN3 induces M2 macrophage infiltration and contributes to angiogenesis in prostate cancer microenvironment.', 'Antiangiogenic VEGF165b Regulates Macrophage Polarization via S100A8/S100A9 in Peripheral Artery Disease.', 'Reciprocal interactions between endothelial cells and macrophages in angiogenic vascular niches.', 'Host microenvironment in breast cancer development: inflammatory and immune cells in tumour angiogenesis and arteriogenesis.', 'UTX deletion promotes M2 macrophage polarization by epigenetically regulating endothelial cell-macrophage crosstalk after spinal cord injury.', 'Effects of Interleukin-4 (IL-4)-releasing microparticles and adoptive transfer of macrophages on immunomodulation and angiogenesis.', 'Macrophage subsets and their role: co-relation with colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor and clinical relevance.', 'Cell therapy attenuates endothelial dysfunction in hypertensive rats with heart failure and preserved ejection fraction.', 'CCL22-Polarized TAMs to M2a Macrophages in Cervical Cancer In Vitro Model.']"""

Methods:   Blinded to outcomes, two radiologists with 1 year and 5 years of experience independently reviewed CTs obtained before and 3 months after chemotherapy initiation in 38 patients with bone metastases from castration-resistant PCa, recording the size, matrix and attenuation of ≤5 lesions; presence of new lesions, extraosseous components, periosteal reactions and cortical thickening; and overall CT assessment (improved, no change or worse). Kappa statistics were used to assess inter-reader agreement; the Kruskal-Wallis test and Cox regression model were used to evaluate associations.  Results:   Inter-reader agreement was low/fair for size change (concordance correlation coefficient=0.013), overall assessment and extraosseous involvement (κ=0.3), moderate for periosteal reaction and cortical thickening (κ=0.4-0.5), and substantial for CT attenuation (κ=0.7).

To address this question, we recently performed unbiased high-resolution mapping of intra- and inter-chromosome interactions upon overexpression of ERG, an oncogenic transcription factor frequently overexpressed in prostate cancer as a result of a gene fusion. By integrating data from genome-wide chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C), ERG binding and gene expression, we have demonstrated that oncogenic transcription factor overexpression is associated with global, reproducible and functionally coherent changes in chromatin organization.

In the present study, we evaluated whether β-Cyclodextrin nanosponge carriers can overcome CPT chemical disadvantages and improve the in vitro anti-tumor efficacy in the androgen refractory models of prostate cancer DU145 and PC-3 and the androgen sensitive model LNCaP. Camptothecin-loaded β-Cyclodextrin nanosponge (CN-CPT) showed sizes of about 400 nm, spherical shape and a drug loading of 38%. HPLC analysis, performed on the cell pellet after treatment with CN-CPT revealed that CPT concentration increased over time indicating a prolonged release of the drug. Moreover, CN-CPT inhibited Topoisomerase I activity, and induced DNA damage, and cell cycle arrest more effectively than CPT, indicating that the CN-CPT formulation does not affect activity of the drug. Moreover, Annexin V/Propidium Iodide staining showed an induction of cell death at low concentrations that were not effective for CTP. LNCaP cells were less sensitive to CPT than PC-3 and DU145 cells, but CN-CPT still exerted higher anti-proliferative activity and DNA damage ability than CPT. The experiments performed in LNCaP cells demonstrated that CN-CPT treatment inhibited expression of the androgen receptor at doses where CPT was ineffective.

The success or failure of drug design often depends on the leading compounds screened in pre-clinical studies. Many efforts, such as in vivo animal experiments and in vitro drug screening, have improved this process, but these methods are usually expensive and laborious. In the post-genomics era, it is possible to seek leading compounds for large-scale candidate small-molecule screening with multiple OMICS datasets. In the present study, we developed a computational method of prioritizing small molecules as leading compounds by integrating transcriptomics and toxicogenomics data. This method provides priority lists for the selection of leading compounds, thereby reducing the time required for drug design. We found 11 known therapeutic small molecules for breast cancer in the top 100 candidates in our list, 2 of which were in the top 10. Furthermore, another 3 of the top 10 small molecules were recorded as closely related to cancer treatment in the DrugBank database.

However, combined therapeutic modalities may be more effective than mono-therapies. In this study, we enhanced the effectiveness of oncolytic virotherapy by matrix metalloproteinase (MMP-9)-mediated degradation of proteins of the tumoral extracellular matrix (ECM), leading to increased viral distribution within the tumors.  Methods:   For this study, the oncolytic vaccinia virus GLV-1h255, containing the mmp-9 gene, was constructed and used to treat PC-3 tumor-bearing mice, achieving an intra-tumoral over-expression of MMP-9. The intra-tumoral MMP-9 content was quantified by immunohistochemistry in tumor sections. Therapeutic efficacy of GLV-1h255 was evaluated by monitoring tumor growth kinetics and intra-tumoral virus titers. Microenvironmental changes mediated by the intra-tumoral MMP-9 over-expression were investigated by microscopic quantification of the collagen IV content, the blood vessel density (BVD) and the analysis of lymph node metastasis formation.  Results:   GLV-1h255-treatment of PC-3 tumors led to a significant over-expression of intra-tumoral MMP-9, accompanied by a marked decrease in collagen IV content in infected tumor areas, when compared to GLV-1h68-infected tumor areas. This led to considerably elevated virus titers in GLV-1h255 infected tumors, and to enhanced tumor regression. The analysis of the BVD, as well as the lumbar and renal lymph node volumes, revealed lower BVD and significantly smaller lymph nodes in both GLV-1h68- and GLV-1h255- injected mice compared to those injected with PBS, indicating that MMP-9 over-expression does not alter the metastasis-reducing effect of oncolytic VACV.  Conclusions:   Taken together, these results indicate that a GLV-1h255-mediated intra-tumoral over-expression of MMP-9 leads to a degradation of collagen IV, facilitating intra-tumoral viral dissemination, and resulting in accelerated tumor regression. We propose that approaches which enhance the oncolytic effect by increasing the intra-tumoral viral load, may be an effective way to improve therapeutic outcome.""","""['Simon Schäfer', 'Stephanie Weibel', 'Ulrike Donat', 'Qian Zhang', 'Richard J Aguilar', 'Nanhai G Chen', 'Aladar A Szalay']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Regression of human prostate tumors and metastases in nude mice following treatment with the recombinant oncolytic vaccinia virus GLV-1h68.', 'Growth inhibition of different human colorectal cancer xenografts after a single intravenous injection of oncolytic vaccinia virus GLV-1h68.', 'Preferential colonization of metastases by oncolytic vaccinia virus strain GLV-1h68 in a human PC-3 prostate cancer model in nude mice.', 'Oncolytic Virus as a Novel Modality for the Treatment of Prostate Cancer.', 'Standardizing analysis of intra-tumoral heterogeneity with computational pathology.', 'Vaccinia virus and peptide-receptor radiotherapy synergize to improve treatment of peritoneal carcinomatosis.', 'Genetic Modifications That Expand Oncolytic Virus Potency.', 'Oncolytic virotherapy reverses the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and its potential in combination with immunotherapy.', 'The Role of the Metzincin Superfamily in Prostate Cancer Progression: A Systematic-Like Review.', 'Intratumoral Canine Distemper Virus Infection Inhibits Tumor Growth by Modulation of the Tumor Microenvironment in a Murine Xenograft Model of Canine Histiocytic Sarcoma.']"""

It lacks specificity and predictive value, resulting in inaccurate diagnoses and overtreatment of the disease. The aim of this study was to assess the usefulness of plasma telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) mRNA as a diagnostic and prognostic tool for PCa and its association with clinicopathological parameters of tumors.  Principal findings:   Plasma hTERT mRNA levels were determined by qRT-PCR in 105 consecutive patients with elevated PSA levels and in 68 healthy volunteers. The diagnostic accuracy, the efficacy as a prognostic factor of biochemical recurrence and the association with tumor clinicopathological parameters of plasma hTERT mRNA and serum PSA tests were determined using univariate and multivariate analyses. The results show that plasma hTERT mRNA is a non-invasive biomarker for PCa diagnosis that shows higher sensitivity (85% vs. 83%), specificity (90% vs. 47%), positive predictive value (83% vs. 56%), and negative predictive value (92% vs. 77%) than serum PSA. Plasma hTERT mRNA is significantly associated with poor prognosis tumor clinicopathological parameters and is a significant independent predictor of PCa (p<0.0001). Univariate analysis identified plasma hTERT mRNA (but not serum PSA) as a significant prognostic factor of biochemical recurrence. Plasma hTERT mRNA Kaplan-Meier curves confirmed the significant differences between groups and patients with higher levels than the cut-off value showed diminished recurrence-free survival (p=0.004), whereas no differences were observed with serum PSA (p=0.38). Multivariate analysis indicated that plasma hTERT mRNA (but not serum PSA) and stage were significantly associated with biochemical recurrence.  Conclusions:   Overall, these findings indicate that hTERT mRNA is a useful non-invasive tumor marker for the molecular diagnosis of PCa, affording a greater diagnostic and prognostic accuracy than the PSA assay and may be of relevance in the follow-up of the disease.""","""['José A March-Villalba', 'José M Martínez-Jabaloyas', 'María J Herrero', 'Jose Santamaria', 'Salvador F Aliño', 'Francisco Dasí']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Plasma hTERT mRNA discriminates between clinically localized and locally advanced disease and is a predictor of recurrence in prostate cancer patients.', 'Real-time quantification of human telomerase reverse transcriptase mRNA in the plasma of patients with prostate cancer.', 'Prognostic Significance of Serum PSA Level and Telomerase, VEGF and GLUT-1 Protein Expression for the Biochemical Recurrence in Prostate Cancer Patients after Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Circulating cell-free human telomerase reverse transcriptase mRNA in plasma and its potential diagnostic and prognostic value for gastric cancer.', 'Proteome-based diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers of prostate cancer.', 'Integrated analysis of circulating cell free nucleic acids for cancer genotyping and immune phenotyping of tumor microenvironment.', 'Telomere Length Changes in Cancer: Insights on Carcinogenesis and Potential for Non-Invasive Diagnostic Strategies.', 'Characterization of blood-derived exosomal hTERT mRNA as a biomarker for colon cancer and Lynch syndrome.', 'Integrative Analyses of Circulating mRNA and lncRNA Expression Profile in Plasma of Lung Cancer Patients.', 'Identification of Combinations of Plasma lncRNAs and mRNAs as Potential Biomarkers for Precursor Lesions and Early Gastric Cancer.']"""

The effects can be reversed by ligand stimulation, which triggers the intrinsic tumor suppressive signaling pathways of EphA2 including inhibition of PI3/Akt and Ras/ERK pathways. These observations argue for development of small molecule agonists for EphA2 as potential tumor intervention agents. Through virtual screening and cell-based assays, we report here the identification and characterization of doxazosin as a novel small molecule agonist for EphA2 and EphA4, but not for other Eph receptors tested. NMR studies revealed extensive contacts of doxazosin with EphA2/A4, recapitulating both hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions recently found in the EphA2/ephrin-A1 complex. Clinically used as an α1-adrenoreceptor antagonist (Cardura®) for treating hypertension and benign prostate hyperplasia, doxazosin activated EphA2 independent of α1-adrenoreceptor. Similar to ephrin-A1, doxazosin inhibited Akt and ERK kinase activities in an EphA2-dependent manner. Treatment with doxazosin triggered EphA2 receptor internalization, and suppressed haptotactic and chemotactic migration of prostate cancer, breast cancer, and glioma cells. Moreover, in an orthotopic xenograft model, doxazosin reduced distal metastasis of human prostate cancer cells and prolonged survival in recipient mice.

Results:   SPMs were 45.4 ± 24.9 nm in diameter and composed of 160.7 ± 22.9 μg/mL iron, 247.0 ± 33.4 μg/mL platinum, and 702.6 ± 206.0 μg/mL paclitaxel. Drug release measurements showed that, at 37°C, half of the paclitaxel was released in 30.2 hours in serum and two times faster in saline. Binding assays suggested that PSMA-targeted SPMs specifically bound to C4-2 human prostate cancer cells in vitro and released paclitaxel into the cells. In vitro, paclitaxel was 2.2 and 1.6 times more cytotoxic than SPMs to C4-2 cells at 24 and 48 hours of incubation, respectively. After 72 hours of incubation, paclitaxel and SPMs were equally cytotoxic. SPMs had MRI transverse relaxivities of 389 ± 15.5 Hz/mM iron, and SIPP micelles with and without drug caused MRI contrast enhancement in vivo.  Conclusion:   Only PSMA-targeted SPMs and paclitaxel significantly prevented growth of C4-2 prostate cancer xenografts in nude mice.

Here we first showed that CD68(+) macrophages were identified in both epithelium and the stromal area of human BPH tissues. We then established an in vitro co-culture model with prostate epithelial and macrophage cell lines to study the potential impacts of infiltrating macrophages in the BPH development and found that co-culturing prostate epithelial cells with macrophages promoted migration of macrophages. In a three-dimensional culture system, the sphere diameter of BPH-1 prostate cells was significantly increased during coculture with THP-1 macrophage cells. Mechanism dissection suggested that expression levels of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers, such as N-cadherin, Snail, and TGF-β2, were increased, and administration of anti-TGF-β2 neutralizing antibody during co-culture suppressed the EMT and THP-1-mediated growth of BPH-1 cells, suggesting THP-1 might go through EMT to influence the BPH development and progression. Importantly, we found that modulation of androgen receptor (AR) in BPH-1 and mPrE cells significantly increased THP-1 and RAW264.7 cell migration, respectively, and enhanced expression levels of EMT markers, suggesting that AR in prostate epithelial cells might play a role in promoting macrophage-mediated EMT in prostate epithelial cells. Silencing AR function via an AR degradation enhancer, ASC-J9, decreased the macrophage migration to BPH-1 cells and suppressed EMT marker expression. Together, these results provide the first evidence to demonstrate that prostate epithelial AR function is important for macrophage-mediated EMT and proliferation of prostate epithelial cells, which represents a previously unrecognized role of AR in the cross-talk between macrophages and prostate epithelial cells. These results may provide new insights for a new therapeutic approach to battle BPH via targeting AR and AR-mediated inflammatory signaling pathways.""","""['Tianjing Lu', 'Wen-Jye Lin', 'Kouji Izumi', 'Xiaohai Wang', 'Defeng Xu', 'Lei-Ya Fang', 'Lei Li', 'Qi Jiang', 'Jie Jin', 'Chawnshang Chang']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Mol Endocrinol""","""['Targeting stromal androgen receptor suppresses prolactin-driven benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).', 'Increased infiltrated macrophages in benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH): role of stromal androgen receptor in macrophage-induced prostate stromal cell proliferation.', 'Androgen receptor roles in the development of benign prostate hyperplasia.', 'M2a macrophage can rescue proliferation and gene expression of benign prostate hyperplasia epithelial and stroma cells from insulin-like growth factor 1 knockdown.', 'Stromal androgen receptor roles in the development of normal prostate, benign prostate hyperplasia, and prostate cancer.', 'Neferine attenuates development of testosterone-induced benign prostatic hyperplasia in mice by regulating androgen and TGF-β/Smad signaling pathways.', 'The number of the intraepithelial T cells correlate with the proliferation index in human bulbourethral gland epithelium.', 'Phloretin in Benign Prostate Hyperplasia and Prostate Cancer: A Contemporary Systematic Review.', 'The Role of Heat Shock Protein 70 Subfamily in the Hyperplastic Prostate: From Molecular Mechanisms to Therapeutic Opportunities.', 'Immune Cell Proinflammatory Microenvironment and Androgen-Related Metabolic Regulation During Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia in Aging.']"""

There are conflicting reports on the effects of myopodin expression on prostate cancer cell migration and invasion. The recent recognition that myopodin is expressed as four different isoforms further complicates our understanding of how this potentially important invasive prostate cancer biomarker affects tumor cell migration and invasion. We now show that myopodin affects the chemokinetic, rather than the chemotactic, properties of PC3 prostate cancer cells. Furthermore, all myopodin isoforms can either increase or decrease PC3 cell migration in response to different chemokinetic stimuli. These migration properties were reflected by differences in cell morphology and the relative dependence on Rho-ROCK signaling pathways induced by the environmental stimuli. Truncation analysis determined that a unique 9-residue C-terminal sequence in the shortest isoform and the conserved, PDZ domain-containing N-terminal region of the long isoforms both contribute to the ability of myopodin to alter the response of PC3 cells to chemokinetic stimuli. Matrigel invasion assays also indicated that myopodin primarily affects the migration, rather than the invasion, properties of PC3 cells.

This is followed by epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), increased cell migration, and metastasis via cooperative activation of p38 and through TGF-β-independent and -dependent mechanisms. In contrast, expressing STMN1 restores cell-cell adhesion and reverses the metastatic cascade. Primary prostate epithelial cell cultures from benign to undifferentiated adenocarcinoma (UA) clinical biopsies show that EMT-like cells arise while the cancer is still organ-confined and that their emergence is tumor-stage specific. Furthermore, primary EMT-like cells exhibit metastatic behavior both in vitro and in vivo as compared with their non-EMT counterpart.

Hypermethylation associated transcriptional silencing of Wnt antagonist genes SFRPs (Secreted Frizzled-Related Proteins) is a frequent oncogenic event. The significance of this is not known in prostate cancer. The objectives of our study were to (i) profile Wnt signaling related gene expression and (ii) investigate methylation of Wnt antagonist genes in prostate cancer. Using TaqMan Low Density Arrays, we identified 15 Wnt signaling related genes with significantly altered expression in prostate cancer; the majority of which were upregulated in tumors. Notably, histologically benign tissue from men with prostate cancer appeared more similar to tumor (r = 0.76) than to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH; r = 0.57, p < 0.001). Overall, the expression profile was highly similar between tumors of high (≥ 7) and low (≤ 6) Gleason scores. Pharmacological demethylation of PC-3 cells with 5-Aza-CdR reactivated 39 genes (≥ 2-fold); 40% of which inhibit Wnt signaling. Methylation frequencies in prostate cancer were 10% (2/20) (SFRP1), 64.86% (48/74) (SFRP2), 0% (0/20) (SFRP4) and 60% (12/20) (SFRP5). SFRP2 methylation was detected at significantly lower frequencies in high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN; 30%, (6/20), p = 0.0096), tumor adjacent benign areas (8.82%, (7/69), p < 0.0001) and BPH (11.43% (4/35), p < 0.0001). The quantitative level of SFRP2 methylation (normalized index of methylation) was also significantly higher in tumors (116) than in the other samples (HGPIN = 7.45, HB = 0.47, and BPH = 0.12).

LNCaP xenografted tumours were treated with anti-androgens and tumour oxygenation measured. Dorsal skin fold (DSF) chambers were used to image tumour vasculature in vivo. Quantitative PCR (QPCR) identified differential gene expression following treatment with bicalutamide. Bicalutamide-treated and vehicle-only-treated tumours were re-established in vitro, and invasion and sensitivity to docetaxel were measured. Tumour growth delay was calculated following treatment with bicalutamide combined with the bioreductive drug AQ4N. Tumour oxygenation measurements showed a precipitate decrease following initiation of ADT. A clinically relevant dose of bicalutamide (2 mg/kg/day) decreased tumour oxygenation by 45% within 24 hr, reaching a nadir of 0.09% oxygen (0.67 ± 0.06 mmHg) by Day 7; this persisted until Day 14 when it increased up to Day 28. Using DSF chambers, LNCaP tumours treated with bicalutamide showed loss of small vessels at Days 7 and 14 with revascularisation occurring by Day 21. QPCR showed changes in gene expression consistent with the vascular changes and malignant progression. Cells from bicalutamide-treated tumours were more malignant than vehicle-treated controls.

Because the follow-up time in these studies was relatively short, these associations could reflect the effect of clinically significant but occult prostate tumors on serum calcium levels. If this were true, prostate cancer mortality rates among men with higher levels of serum calcium should be higher during the early follow-up period and should decline thereafter.  Methods:   We tested this hypothesis by estimating the relative risk of death from prostate cancer in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III for incremental increases in total and ionized serum calcium using Cox proportional hazards regression with time-dependent effects.  Results:   Forty-nine (49) fatal prostate cancers occurred over 204 months of follow-up and 1,069,327 person-months of observation. Men with higher total serum calcium and higher serum ionized calcium had increased risks of fatal prostate cancer during the first 96 months of follow-up [Relative Hazard (RH) = 1.50 per 0.1 mmol/L total serum calcium, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.04-2.17; RH = 1.72 per 0.05 mmol/L ionized calcium, 95% CI = 1.11-2.66]. Evidence of an association between total and ionized serum calcium and prostate cancer deaths was not significant after 96 months.  Conclusions:   Our analyses support the hypothesis that the elevated risk for fatal prostate cancer observed in men with high serum calcium is because of the presence of extant, but occult prostate cancer.

Oncolytic adenoviruses have been actively pursued as potential agents for cancer treatment. Virtually all clinical trials on oncolytic adenovirus are based on serotype 5. However, viral replication in hepatocytes induces severe liver toxicity and limits its systemic administration for metastatic disease. Moreover, rapid clearance of viral particles injected intravenously further hinders the anticancer efficacy. Adenovirus 6 (Ad6) was previously reported to exhibit less liver toxicity and escape Kupffer cells absorption after systemic administration. To further improve its safety, we generated a novel oncolytic adenovirus Ad6miR, in which four copies of binding sites of a liver-specific microRNA miR122 were incorporated into E1A gene of Ad6. miR122 regulation significantly decreased Ad6 replication in hepatocytes and consequently hepatotoxicity because of the negative regulation of miR122. Cytotoxicity assay using primary or established prostate cancer cell lines showed robust oncolytic activity of Ad6miR. Systemic treatment of established tumors with Ad6miR showed strong antitumor activity, comparable with that of Ad6 or Ad5. Although Ad6 evaded Kupffer cells, its blood clearance rate was as rapid as Ad5. The vast majority of Ad6 particles intravenously injected localized in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells rather than previously reported Kupffer cells. Elevating Ad6miR injection dose increased circulating Ad6miR concentration and its antitumor efficacy. miR122 regulation of Ad6 significantly improves its safety profile after systemic administration, which allows increasing therapeutic doses leading to improved anticancer efficacy of systemic treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer.""","""['Zhenwei Zhang', 'Xuemei Zhang', 'Kam Newman', 'Xinyuan Liu', 'Prem Seth']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Ther""","""['Oncolytic adenovirus Ad657 for systemic virotherapy against prostate cancer.', 'Use of tissue-specific microRNA to control pathology of wild-type adenovirus without attenuation of its ability to kill cancer cells.', 'Chemical modification with high molecular weight polyethylene glycol reduces transduction of hepatocytes and increases efficacy of intravenously delivered oncolytic adenovirus.', 'Adenovirus-based therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Tropism and transduction of oncolytic adenovirus vectors in prostate cancer therapy.', 'Development of Oncolytic Vectors Based on Human Adenovirus Type 6 for Cancer Treatment.', 'Adenovirus Type 6: Subtle Structural Distinctions from Adenovirus Type 5 Result in Essential Differences in Properties and Perspectives for Gene Therapy.', 'Oncolytic Adenoviruses: Strategies for Improved Targeting and Specificity.', 'Oncolytic adenovirus programmed by synthetic gene circuit for cancer immunotherapy.', 'Screening and Detection of Prostate Cancer-Review of Literature and Current Perspective.']"""

Recent investigations have highlighted differential cellular responses to modulated radiation fields particularly in areas outside the primary treatment field that cannot be accounted for by scattered dose alone. In the present study, we determined the DNA damage response within the normal human fibroblast AG0-1522B and the prostate cancer cell line DU-145 utilising the DNA damage assay. Cells plated in slide flasks were exposed to 1 Gy uniform or modulated radiation fields. Modulated fields were delivered by shielding 25%, 50% or 75% of the flask during irradiation. The average number of 53BP1 or γH2AX foci was measured in 2 mm intervals across the slide area. Following 30 minutes after modulated radiation field exposure an increase in the average number of foci out-of-field was observed when compared to non-irradiated controls. In-field, a non-uniform response was observed with a significant decrease in the average number of foci compared to uniformly irradiated cells. Following 24 hrs after exposure there is evidence for two populations of responding cells to bystander signals in-and out-of-field. There was no significant difference in DNA damage response between 25%, 50% or 75% modulated fields. The response was dependent on cellular secreted intercellular signalling as physical inhibition of intercellular communication abrogated the observed response. Elevated residual DNA damage observed within out-of-field regions decreased following addition of an inducible nitric oxide synthase inhibitor (Aminoguanidine). These data show, for the first time, differential DNA damage responses in-and out-of-field following modulated radiation field delivery. This study provides further evidence for a role of intercellular communication in mediating cellular radiobiological response to modulated radiation fields and may inform the refinement of existing radiobiological models for the optimization of advanced radiotherapy treatment plans.""","""['Colman Trainor', 'Karl T Butterworth', 'Conor K McGarry', 'Stephen J McMahon', ""Joe M O'Sullivan"", 'Alan R Hounsell', 'Kevin M Prise']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Cell survival responses after exposure to modulated radiation fields.', 'Out-of-field cell survival following exposure to intensity-modulated radiation fields.', 'Cell survival and DNA damage in normal prostate cells irradiated out-of-field.', 'High dose bystander effects in spatially fractionated radiation therapy.', 'Radiation-induced bystander effect: the important part of ionizing radiation response.

First, the U937 monocyte cell line was differentiated into macrophages using phorbol acetate (PMA), and cells were induced with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for cytokine secretion. Next, the cytokine levels (TNFα, IL-6, and IL1β) in conditioned media (CM) were analyzed. Prostate cells were then fed with CM containing varying concentrations of TNFα, and IkB degradation, nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB) translocation and transactivation, and the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-8 (MMP8) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9) were then assessed. As a result of CM treatment, ubiquitin-mediated AR degradation, which was restored using anti-TNFα antibody neutralization, led to both a decrease in KLK4, PSA, and NKX3.1 expression levels and the upregulation of GPX2. In addition to the loss of AR, acute and chronic CM exposure resulted in p53 degradation and consequent p21 downregulation, which was also restored by either androgen administration or ectopic NKX3.1 expression via the stabilization of MDM2 levels in LNCaP cells. Additionally, CM treatment enhanced H2AX((S139)) phosphorylation (a hallmark of DNA damage) and genetic heterogeneity in the absence of androgens in prostate cells without activating mitochondrial apoptosis. Thus, the data suggest that inflammatory cytokine exposure results in the loss of AR and p53 signaling in prostate cells and facilitates genetic heterogeneity via ROS accumulation to promote prostate carcinogenesis.""","""['Bilge Debelec-Butuner', 'Cansu Alapinar', 'Lokman Varisli', 'Burcu Erbaykent-Tepedelen', 'Syed Muhammad Hamid', 'Ceren Gonen-Korkmaz', 'Kemal Sami Korkmaz']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Mol Carcinog""","""['Nodakenin suppresses lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammatory responses in macrophage cells by inhibiting tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 and nuclear factor-κB pathways and protects mice from lethal endotoxin shock.', '6-(3,4-Dihydro-1H-isoquinoline-2-yl)-N-(6-methoxypyridine-2-yl) nicotinamide-26 (DIMN-26) decreases cell proliferation by induction of apoptosis and downregulation of androgen receptor signaling in human prostate cancer cells.', 'p53 overexpression represses androgen-mediated induction of NKX3.1 in a prostate cancer cell line.', 'Novel roles of androgen receptor, epidermal growth factor receptor, TP53, regulatory RNAs, NF-kappa-B, chromosomal translocations, neutrophil associated gelatinase, and matrix metalloproteinase-9 in prostate cancer and prostate cancer stem cells.', 'MDM2 beyond cancer: podoptosis, development, inflammation, and tissue regeneration.', 'Adjuvant action of needle-shaped BC microfibrils.', 'Sex-the most underappreciated variable in research: insights from helminth-infected hosts.', 'Applications of Vertebrate Models in Studying Prostatitis and Inflammation-Associated Prostatic Diseases.', 'Oxidative stress and redox signaling in CRPC progression: therapeutic potential of clinically-tested Nrf2-activators.', 'Prostate Microbiota and Prostate Cancer: A New Trend in Treatment.']"""

Our previous studies demonstrated that lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), a low-molecular-weight lipid growth factor, enhances VEGF-C expression in human endothelial cells. We previously demonstrated that the LPA receptor plays an important role in lymphatic development in zebrafish embryos. However, the effects of LPA on VEGF-C expression in prostate cancer are not known. Herein, we demonstrate that LPA up-regulated VEGF-C expression in three different human prostate cancer cell lines. In PC-3 human prostate cancer cells, the enhancing effects of LPA were mediated through both LPA1 and LPA3. In addition, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and lens epithelium-derived growth factor (LEDGF) expression were involved in LPA(1/3)-dependent VEGF-C expression. Furthermore, autotaxin (ATX), an enzyme responsible for LPA synthesis, also participates in regulating VEGF-C expression. By interrupting LPA(1/3) of PC-3, conditioned medium (CM) -induced human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) lymphatic markers expression was also blocked. In summary, we found that LPA enhances VEGF-C expression through activating LPA(1/3)-, ROS-, and LEDGF-dependent pathways.

Thapsigargin (TG) is a highly toxic natural plant product that triggers a rise in intracellular calcium levels and apoptosis. FAP is therefore a provocative target for the activation of prodrugs consisting of a FAP-specific peptide coupled to a potent cytotoxic analog of TG.  Methods:   The efficacy of FAP-activated peptidyl-TG prodrugs was tested in vitro in cell proliferation assays and effects on intracellular calcium in human cancer cell lines. The effects of FAP-activated prodrugs on tumor growth and host toxicity were tested in Balb-C nude MCF-7 and LNCaP xenograft mice (n = 9-11 per group). P values were calculated using permutation tests based on 50 000 permutations. Mixed effects models were used to account for correlations among replicate measures. All statistical tests were two-sided.  Results:   FAP-activated prodrugs killed human cancer cells at low nanomolar concentrations (MCF-7 cells: IC(50) = 3.5 nM). Amino acid-12ADT analogs from FAP-cleaved prodrugs, but not uncleaved prodrugs, produced a rapid rise in intracellular calcium within minutes of exposure. Immunohistochemical analysis of xenografts exposed to FAP-prodrugs documented stromal-selective cell death of fibroblasts, pericytes, and endothelial cells of sufficient magnitude to inhibit growth of MCF-7 and LNCaP xenografts with minimal systemic toxicity, whereas non-FAP cleavable prodrugs were inactive. MCF-7 and LNCaP xenografts treated with a FAP-activated prodrug had maximal treated-to-control tumor volume ratios of 0.36 (treated: mean = 0.206 mm(3), 95% CI = 0.068 to 0.344 mm(3); control: mean = 0.580 mm(3), 95% CI = 0.267 to 0.893 mm(3)) and 0.24 (treated: mean = 0.131 mm(3), 95% CI = 0.09 to 0.180 mm(3); control: mean = 0.543 mm(3), 95% CI = 0.173 to 0.913 mm(3)), respectively, on day 21 after therapy.

The internalization of PSMA has been shown to vary with inhibitors' mode of binding: irreversible, slowly reversible, and reversible.  Methods:   In the present study, PSMA-targeted clickable derivatives of an irreversible phosphoramidate inhibitor DBCO-PEG(4) -CTT-54 (IC(50) = 1.0 nM) and a slowly reversible phosphate inhibitor, DBCO-PEG(4) -CTT-54.2 (IC(50) = 6.6 nM) were clicked to (99m) Tc(CO)(3) -DPA-azide to assemble a PSMA-targeted SPECT agent. The selectivity, percent uptake, and internalization of these PSMA-targeted SPECT agents were evaluated in PSMA-positive and PSMA-negative cells.  Results:   In vitro studies demonstrated that PSMA-targeted SPECT agents exhibited selective cellular uptake in the PSMA-positive LNCaP cells compared to PSMA-negative PC3 cells. More importantly, it was found that (99m) Tc(CO)(3) -DPA-DBCO-PEG(4) -CTT-54 based on an irreversible PSMA inhibitor core, exhibited greater uptake and internalization than (99m) Tc(CO)(3) -DPA-DBCO-PEG(4) -CTT-54.2 constructed from a slowly reversible PSMA inhibitor core.  Conclusions:   We have demonstrated that a PSMA-targeted SPECT agent can be assembled efficiently using copper-less click chemistry. In addition, we demonstrated that mode of binding has an effect on internalization and percent uptake of PSMA-targeted SPECT agents; with the irreversible targeting agent demonstrating superior uptake and internalization in PSMA+ cells. The approach demonstrated in this work now supports a modular approach for the assembly of PSMA-targeted imaging and therapeutic agents.""","""['Jessie R Nedrow-Byers', 'Adam L Moore', 'Tanushree Ganguly', 'Mark R Hopkins', 'Melody D Fulton', 'Paul D Benny', 'Clifford E Berkman']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Preparation and Biological Evaluation of 99mTcTc-CNGU as a PSMA-Targeted Radiotracer for the Imaging of Prostate Cancer.', 'Preclinical Evaluation and First Patient Application of 99mTc-PSMA-I&S for SPECT Imaging and Radioguided Surgery in Prostate Cancer.', '99mTc-labeled small-molecule inhibitors of prostate-specific membrane antigen for molecular imaging of prostate cancer.', 'Radiolabeled enzyme inhibitors and binding agents targeting PSMA: Effective theranostic tools for imaging and therapy of prostate cancer.', 'Targeting Nanomedicines to Prostate Cancer: Evaluation of Specificity of Ligands to Two Different Receptors In Vivo.', 'Therapeutic potential of targeting mirnas to prostate cancer tumors: using psma as an active target.', 'Application of the Chelator-Based Clickable Radiotheranostic Platform to Moderate-Molecular-Weight Ligands.', 'A Review on the Current State and Future Perspectives of 99mTcTc-Housed PSMA-i in Prostate Cancer.', 'Metamorphosis of prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) inhibitors.', 'Molecular Imaging in Primary Staging of Prostate Cancer Patients: Current Aspects and Future Trends.']"""

Apoptosis has been implicated in the tumor response to AD, but constitutes a small fraction of the total tumor at any time. Cellular senescence is a response to sub-lethal stress in which cells are persistently growth arrested and develop distinct morphological and biochemical characteristics. The occurrence of senescence in prostate tumor tissue after AD therapy has not previously been investigated.  Methods:   Phenotypic and molecular characteristics of senescence were examined in models of androgen-sensitive prostate cancer after AD and compared with androgen-intact controls.  Results:   In vitro in LNCaP cells, AD induced elevated senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) staining, decreased proliferation, and increased flow cytometric side scatter while minimally affecting cell viability. The increased expression of the senescence-related proteins Glb1, the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27(Kip1) and chromatin-regulating heterochromatin protein 1γ (HP1γ) were detected in LNCaP cells after AD in vitro by immunoblot and immunofluorescence microscopy. In mice bearing LuCaP xenograft tumors in vivo, surgical castration similarly increased SA-β-gal staining, increased expression of p27(Kip1) and HP1γ, and decreased expression of the proliferation marker KI-67, with minimal induction of apoptosis identified by detection of cleaved caspase 3 and TUNEL. Immunohistochemical analysis of human prostate tumors removed after AD shows similar induction of Glb1, HP1γ and decreased KI-67.  Conclusions:   We conclude that AD induces characteristics consistent with cellular senescence in androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cells.

We investigated AGR2 expression in patients with metastatic prostate cancer.  Methods:   Blood was collected from 44 patients with metastatic prostate cancer separated as: castration sensitive prostate cancer (CSPC, n = 5); castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC, n = 36); and neuroendocrine-predominate CRPC defined by PSA ≤ 1 ng/ml in the presence of wide-spread metastatic disease (NE-CRPC, n = 3). AGR2 mRNA levels were measured with RT-PCR in circulating tumor cell (CTC)-enriched peripheral blood. Plasma AGR2 levels were determined via ELISA assay. AGR2 expression was modulated in prostate cancer cell lines using plasmid and viral vectors.  Results:   AGR2 mRNA levels are elevated in CTCs and strongly correlated with CTC enumeration. Plasma AGR2 levels are elevated in all sub-groups. AGR2 levels vary independently to PSA and change in some patients in response to androgen-directed and other therapies. Plasma AGR2 levels are highest in the NE-CRPC sub-group. A correlation between AGR2, chromagranin A (CGA), and neuron-specific enolase (NSE) expression is demonstrated in prostate cancer cell lines.  Conclusions:   We conclude that AGR2 expression is elevated at the mRNA and protein level in patients with metastatic prostate cancer.

The exact function of CXCL14 in human breast cancer is still unclear, although it has been testified to play an anti-tumor role in other tumors, including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, lung cancer, prostate cancer, and so on. In this study, we tried to demonstrate the relationship between CXCL14 and breast cancer. CXCL14 expressions were detected by reverse transcription-PCR and western blot in 2 normal breast epithelial cell lines and 6 breast cancer cell lines. The effects of CXCL14 on the proliferation and invasion in vitro were tested using the CXCL14-overexpressing cells (MDA-MB-231HM-CXCL14) which were established by stable transfection. We established an orthotropic xenograft tumor model in SCID mice using the MDA-MB-231HM-CXCL14 cells and explored the influence of CXCL14 overexpression on tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. Furthermore, we detected the protein level of CXCL14 in 208 breast cancer patients by immunohistochemistry and discussed the correlation between CXCL14 and the prognosis of breast cancer. CXCL14 mRNA expression is lower in breast cancer cell lines, and MDA-MB-231HM express the lowest levels of CXCL14 mRNA. Overexpression of CXCL14 inhibited cell proliferation and invasion in vitro and attenuated xenograft tumor growth and lung metastasis in vivo. CXCL14 protein level is positively correlated to the overall survival of all patients as well as the patients with lymph node metastasis, and it has a negative correlation with the lymph node metastasis. Our study showed for the first time that CXCL14 is a negative regulator of growth and metastasis in breast cancer.

Here, we demonstrate the existence of a non-canonical mechanism for NKX3.1 turnover that does not require ubiquitination. Using a structure-function approach, we have determined that the conserved, C-terminal 21-amino acid domain of NKX3.1 (C21) is required for this novel ubiquitin-independent degradation mechanism. Addition of C21 decreased half-life of enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) by 5-fold, demonstrating that C21 constitutes a portable degron. Point mutational analyses of C21 revealed that a conserved proline residue (Pro-221) is central to degron activity, and mutation to alanine (P221A) increased NKX3.1 half-life >2-fold. Proteasome inhibition and in vivo ubiquitination analyses indicated that degron activity is ubiquitin-independent. Evaluating degron activity in the context of a ubiquitination-resistant, lysine-null NKX3.1 mutant (NKX3.1(KO)) confirmed that P221A mutation conferred additional stability to NKX3.1.

Published information on the frequency and characteristics of CRPC patients are lacking. This may be partly because there is no specific code which doctors can use to record CRPC, making research in existing data sources such as the General Practice Research Database (GPRD) difficult.  Methods:   The aim of this study was to firstly develop a method to accurately and thoroughly identify CRPC patients in the GPRD, using a combination of codes for treatments and diagnostic tests which these patients are likely to have received. Secondly, the anonymised electronic medical records were used to study the identified CRPC patient characteristics, such as age, treatments, comorbidity and expected survival.  Results:   After comprehensive exploratory research, the final algorithm was selected to identify patients' assumed recording on the GPRD of either a rising prostate specific antigen (PSA) value (clinical definition of CRPC) or evidence of a switch in treatment after castration. Using the algorithm, over the 1999-2009 study period, 11600 castrated prostate cancer patients were identified. Of these, 3277 (28%) developed CRPC during the study period, with an incidence rate of 8.3 per 100 person years in castrated prostate cancer patients, and 3.8 per 100 person years in all prostate cancer patients. Mean patient age at CRPC was 76.8 years, and mean survival duration from CRPC status was 13.5 months, and from first prostate cancer diagnosis was 48.2 months. The most common comorbidities among CRPC patients were hypertension, dyspnoea, and anaemia.  Conclusions:   Sensitivity analyses to test algorithms with differing inclusion criteria suggested that the primary algorithm was robust, reducing bias through missing data, while avoiding 'false positives' and retaining clinical credibility.

Intraoperative electrical stimulation of the cavernous nerves while measuring changes in penile girth has previously been shown to provide the surgeon with feedback of nerve integrity.  Aim:   To test the feasibility of recording changes in glans penis blood flow by Laser Doppler flowmetry from cavernous nerve stimulation.  Methods:   Fifteen patients with localized prostate cancer undergoing radical prostatectomy had electrical stimulation of the proximal and distal parts of the neurovascular bundles after prostate removal. The stimulation consisted of 30-40 seconds biphasic constant current (10-30 mA) with 0.5 millisecond pulse duration.  Main outcome measures:   Stimulus induced changes in penile blood flow was recorded from a Laser Doppler probe attached to the glans penis. Changes in penile girth were simultaneously recorded from a mercury-in rubber strain gauge. Erectile function was evaluated three months after surgery.  Results:   Ten patients had stimulus induced increase in Laser Doppler flow unilaterally (N=7) or bilaterally (N=3). Out of 10 patients, 6 reported some preserved erectile function postoperatively at 3 months follow-up (indicating 6 true and 4 false positives). Three patients had no Doppler response from stimulation and had no postoperative erectile function postoperatively (indicating three true negatives). Two patients were excluded from the study due to bad signal quality in the Laser Doppler signal. In the majority of patients, stimulation produced increase in penile girth sensed by the strain gauge.  Conclusion:   This preliminary report provides evidence that Laser Doppler Flowmetry is able to detect increased penile blood flow from intraoperative electrical stimulation of the neurovascular bundles. However, further improvement in the recording technique is required.

A total of 252 patients (33.15%) had a prostate cancer and out of them 17 (6.7%) had a microscopic prostate cancer--16 a single microscopic focus and a case 2 microscopic foci in two different specimens. PSA ranged 5 to 7.4 ng/ml (mean 6.2 ng/ml), age ranged 61 to 75 (mean 68.29), Gleason score was G6 in all cases; in 4 cases a microscopic focus of PIN3 was associated.  Results:   All patients had a RP and the pathologic stage was T2a in 4, T2b in 1, T2c in 9 (3 of these had microscopic PIN3 at biopsy) and T3a in 3 (including the one with 2 microscopic foci of prostate cancer on 2 different bioptic samples). Gleason was G6 in 12 cases and G7 in 5.  Discussion:   The single microscopic focus of prostate cancer has always raised diagnostic problems, in fact some authors report these patients have 30 to 90% of probability to have a significant prostatic cancer (volume > 0.5 mi) whereas other authors found an insignificant prostatic cancer in 30% of the patients with a single microscopic focus of prostate cancer. It is really very difficult to predict the extent of the tumor in these cases because the different parameters employed are not reliable. Our series, although very small, support the hypothesis that significant cancers are more frequently associated with a single microscopic focus of prostate cancer at biopsy (in fact 17 out of 17 patients had a significant cancer) and consequently we feel that it is more oncologically correct to choose an aggressive therapy in these cases (RP, radiotherapy or androgen deprivation according to the individual case) rather then a ""wait and see"" which could be less cautious.""","""['Giandomenico Passavanti', 'Michele Gnech']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Arch Ital Urol Androl""","""['Micro-focal prostate cancer: a comparison of biopsy and radical prostatectomy specimen features.', 'Minute focus of prostate cancer on needle biopsy: correlation with radical prostatectomy specimen.', 'Extended prostate biopsy scheme improves reliability of Gleason grading: implications for radiotherapy patients.', 'Relationship between systematic biopsies and histological features of 222 radical prostatectomy specimens: lack of prediction of tumor significance for men with nonpalpable prostate cancer.', 'A solitary positive prostate cancer biopsy does not predict a unilateral lesion in radical prostatectomy specimens.']"""

Cathepsin H was recently proposed to be involved in processing of bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP-4) in mice. In order to clarify whether cathepsin H also regulates BMP-4 in humans, its impact on BMP-4 expression, processing and degradation was investigated in prostate cancer (PC-3), osteosarcoma (HOS) and pro-monocytic (U937) human cell lines.  Materials and methods:   BMP-4 expression was founded to be regulated by cathepsin H using PCR array technology and confirmed by real time PCR. Immunoassays including Western blot and confocal microscopy were used to evaluate the influence of cathepsin H on BMP-4 processing.  Results:   In contrast to HOS, the expression of BMP-4 mRNA in U937 and PC3 cells was significantly decreased by cathepsin H. The different regulation of BMP-4 synthesis could be associated with the absence of the mature 28 kDa cathepsin H form in HOS cells, where only the intermediate 30 kDa form was observed. No co-localization of BMP-4 and cathepsin H was observed in human cell lines and the multistep processing of BMP-4 was not altered in the presence of specific cathepsin H inhibitor. Isolated cathepsin H does not cleave mature recombinant BMP-4, neither with its amino- nor its endopeptidase activity.  Conclusions:   Our results exclude direct proteolytic processing of BMP-4 by cathepsin H, however, they provide support for its involvement in the regulation of BMP-4 expression.""","""['Matija Rojnik', 'Zala Jevnikar', 'Bojana Mirkovic', 'Damjan Janes', 'Nace Zidar', 'Danijel Kikelj', 'Janko Kos']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Radiol Oncol""","""['The influence of differential processing of procathepsin H on its aminopeptidase activity, secretion and subcellular localization in human cell lines.', 'Expression of bone morphogenetic protein messenger RNAs by normal rat and human prostate and prostate cancer cells.', 'Influence of BMPs on the formation of osteoblastic lesions in metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Compactin and simvastatin, but not pravastatin, induce bone morphogenetic protein-2 in human osteosarcoma cells.', 'Bone morphogenetic proteins.', 'Cathepsins in oral diseases: mechanisms and therapeutic implications.', 'Favorable Prognostic Impact of Cathepsin H (CTSH) High Expression in Thyroid Carcinoma.', 'Bone morphogenetic protein signaling in musculoskeletal cancer.', 'Roles of bone morphogenetic protein signaling in osteosarcoma.', 'Cathepsin H mediates the processing of talin and regulates migration of prostate cancer cells.']"""

We estimated the risks of primary cancers other than colorectal cancer following a diagnosis of colorectal cancer in mutation carriers.  Methods:   We obtained data from the Colon Cancer Family Registry for 764 carriers of an MMR gene mutation (316 MLH1, 357 MSH2, 49 MSH6, and 42 PMS2), who had a previous diagnosis of colorectal cancer. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate their cumulative risk of cancers 10 and 20 years after colorectal cancer. We estimated the age-, sex-, country- and calendar period-specific standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) of cancers following colorectal cancer, compared with the general population.  Results:   Following colorectal cancer, carriers of MMR gene mutations had the following 10-year risk of cancers in other organs: kidney, renal pelvis, ureter, and bladder (2%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1% to 3%); small intestine, stomach, and hepatobiliary tract (1%, 95% CI = 0.2% to 2%); prostate (3%, 95% CI = 1% to 5%); endometrium (12%, 95% CI = 8% to 17%); breast (2%, 95% CI = 1% to 4%); and ovary (1%, 95% CI = 0% to 2%).

Methods:   Patients have been surveyed before, at the last day, and 2-3 months after radiotherapy using a validated questionnaire (Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite). Median dose to the prostate in the spacer subgroup (SP) was 78 Gy in 2 Gy fractions. The results were independently compared with two matched-pair subgroups (treated conventionally without spacer): 3D conformal 70.2 Gy in 1.8 Gy fractions (3DCRT) and intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) 76 Gy in 2 Gy fractions. There were 28 patients in each of the three groups.  Results:   Baseline mean bowel bother scores were 96 points in all subgroups. Similar mean changes (SP 16, 3DCRT 14, IMRT 17 points) were observed at the end of radiotherapy. The smallest difference resulted in the spacer subgroup 2-3 months after radiotherapy (SP 2, 3DCRT 8, IMRT 6 points). Bowel bother scores were only significantly different in comparison to baseline levels in the spacer subgroup. The percentage of patients reporting moderate/big bother with specific symptoms did not increase for any item (urgency, frequency, diarrhoea, incontinence, bloody stools, pain).  Conclusion:   Moderate bowel quality-of-life changes can be expected during radiotherapy irrespective of spacer application or total dose.

Clinical tests for glucose, cholesterol, creatine, creatinine or uric acid in blood or urine and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for pesticides, hepatitis or acquired immune deficiency syndrome are good examples of such applications. The most widely used and commercially available peroxidase for biotechnological processes and analytical applications is horseradish peroxidase followed, although in much lower proportion, by soybean peroxidase. The high commercial interest in peroxidases has led to the search for new sources of these enzymes. This work describes the analytical use of lentil plant peroxidase (LPP), which is a new peroxidase extracted from lentil plants (Lens culinaris Medikus); an abundant post-harvest agricultural waste in the area of Castilla y León (Spain). A procedure for the quantification of hydrogen peroxide in urine is first proposed using crude extract of lentil plant instead of the purified enzyme. This procedure is then applied to the determination of sarcosine; a natural amino acid that has attracted considerable interest in clinical diagnostics since urinary sarcosine was proposed and later questioned as a biomarker for prostate cancer. Under the action of sarcosine oxidase, sarcosine is oxidized by molecular oxygen to give glycine, formaldehyde and hydrogen peroxide that is quantified according to the previously proposed procedure. The limit of detection for both hydrogen peroxide and sarcosine is around 5 × 10(-7) M. In the determination of sarcosine, the high selectivity of the overall enzymatic reaction, the simple sample treatment and instrumentation, the high-sample throughput and the use of LPP in the plant extract instead of the purified enzyme provide a rapid and inexpensive procedure with characteristics very suitable for routine analysis in a clinical laboratory.""","""['Patricia Pérez Galende', 'Teresa Manzano Muñoz', 'Manuel G Roig', 'Cándido García de María']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Anal Bioanal Chem""","""['Screening of postharvest agricultural wastes as alternative sources of peroxidases: characterization and kinetics of a novel peroxidase from lentil ( Lens culinaris L.) stubble.', 'A Rapid Method for the Detection of Sarcosine Using SPIONs/Au/CS/SOX/NPs for Prostate Cancer Sensing.', 'Facile one-step targeted immobilization of an enzyme based on silane emulsion self-assembled molecularly imprinted polymers for visual sensors.', 'Molecular biology and application of plant peroxidase genes.', 'Hydrogen peroxide-mediated inactivation of two chloroplastic peroxidases, ascorbate peroxidase and 2-cys peroxiredoxin.', 'Sustainable and circular agro-environmental practices: A review of the management of agricultural waste biomass in Spain and the Czech Republic.', 'Development of sarcosine quantification in urine based on enzyme-coupled colorimetric method for prostate cancer diagnosis.']"""

Alterations in the DNA methylation pattern can be one of the leading causes for prostate cancer formation. This study is the first high-throughput sequencing study investigating genome-wide DNA methylation patterns in a large cohort of 51 tumor and 53 benign prostate samples using methylated DNA immunoprecipitation sequencing. Comparative analyses identified more than 147,000 cancer-associated epigenetic alterations. In addition, global methylation patterns show significant differences based on the TMPRSS2-ERG rearrangement status. We propose the hypermethylation of miR-26a as an alternative pathway of ERG rearrangement-independent EZH2 activation.

Whether the presence of HPV in the genitourinary tract of men is associated with a higher prostate cancer risk has been a matter of research for a long-time and the results are still not fully conclusive. Similarly, the question of the reservoir of HPV infection in men is not clearly resolved. HPV DNA presence and types were evaluated by means of polymerase chain reaction in the tissue of 146 patients with benign prostate hyperplasia and prostate cancer. HPV-specific antibodies were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in the sera of all patients and 172 controls. In addition, 256 biopsies taken from non-tumorous tissues were analyzed. No statistically significant differences were observed in HPV DNA prevalence between patients with benign prostate hyperplasia (2%) and patients with prostatic cancer (2%; P = 1.000). The seropositivity rates did not differ significantly between groups of subjects except for antibodies against HPV 6 VLPs which were found more often in prostate cancer patients (adjusted P = 0.018). Similarly, no difference in the seroprevalence rates for HPV 16 E6 and/or E7 oncoproteins between groups of patients and healthy controls was detected. The overall HPV prevalence in 256 healthy tissue samples was 4%. The results indicate that HPV infection is not associated with prostate oncogenesis in men.

Methods and materials:   Between January 2002 and December 2009, 718 consecutive patients with clinically localized prostate cancer were treated with transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided HDR monotherapy. Three treatment protocols were applied; 141 patients received 38.0 Gy using one implant in 4 fractions of 9.5 Gy with computed tomography-based treatment planning; 351 patients received 38.0 Gy in 4 fractions of 9.5 Gy, using 2 implants (2 weeks apart) and intraoperative TRUS real-time treatment planning; and 226 patients received 34.5 Gy, using 3 single-fraction implants of 11.5 Gy (3 weeks apart) and intraoperative TRUS real-time treatment planning.

The network of regulatory miRNA-target and functional protein interactions is a rich source of information to elucidate the function and the prognostic value of miRNAs in cancer. The objective of this study is to identify miRNAs that have high influence on target protein complexes in prostate cancer as a case study. This could provide biomarkers or therapeutic targets relevant for prostate cancer treatment.  Results:   Our findings demonstrate that a miRNA's functional role can be explained by its target protein connectivity within a physical and functional interaction network. To detect miRNAs with high influence on target protein modules, we integrated miRNA and mRNA expression profiles with a sequence based miRNA-target network and human functional and physical protein interactions (FPI). miRNAs with high influence on target protein complexes play a role in prostate cancer progression and are promising diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers. We uncovered several miRNA-regulated protein modules which were enriched in focal adhesion and prostate cancer genes. Several miRNAs such as miR-96, miR-182, and miR-143 demonstrated high influence on their target protein complexes and could explain most of the gene expression changes in our analyzed prostate cancer data set.

What's known on the subject? and What does the study add? Active surveillance aims to reduce overtreatment by selecting patients with low risk prostate cancer (PCa) based on favourable disease characteristics. However, most studies on active surveillance do not have long-term results available; in particular, data on patients with intermediate risk disease are lacking. Our findings demonstrate that withholding radical treatment in men with low or intermediate risk screen-detected localized PCa leads to a substantial delay or even avoidance of radical treatment in a majority of men. Favourable disease-specific outcomes confirm the feasibility of active surveillance for low risk PCa and also support a role for active surveillance in selected patients with intermediate risk PCa.  Objective:   • To assess the longer-term feasibility of active surveillance, we aimed to evaluate outcomes of patients with screen-detected localized prostate cancer (PCa) who initially elected to withhold radical treatment for either low or intermediate risk disease.  Patients and methods:   • All men underwent screening for PCa in the Rotterdam and Helsinki arms of the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC); eligible men were diagnosed with PCa prior to the establishment of the ERSPC-affiliated Prostate Cancer Research International: Active Surveillance (PRIAS) study (1994-2007) and were initially expectantly managed in the absence of a fixed follow-up protocol. • Low risk PCa was defined as clinical stage T1/T2, PSA ≤ 10 ng/mL, PSA density < 0.2 ng/mL/mL, Gleason ≤ 6 and maximum two positive biopsy cores, whereas PSA 10-20 ng/mL, Gleason score 7 and three positive biopsy cores were considered intermediate risk features. • Disease-specific, overall and treatment-free survival were analysed using the Kaplan-Meier and competing risks methods.  Results:   • In all, 509 patients with PCa were eligible, of whom 381 were considered low risk and 128 intermediate risk. • During a median follow-up of 7.4 years, a total of 221 patients (43.4%) switched to deferred treatment after a median of 2.6 years. • The calculated 10-year disease-specific survival rates were 99.1% and 96.1% for low and intermediate risk patients, respectively (P = 0.44), and for overall survival 79.0% and 64.5%, respectively (P = 0.003). • Competing risks analysis showed similar results.  Conclusions:   • Withholding radical treatment in men with low to intermediate risk screen-detected PCa leads to a substantial delay or even avoidance of radical treatment and its potential side-effects in a majority of patients. • Disease-specific outcomes at 7.4 years of follow-up are favourable in low as well as intermediate risk patients. • This confirms the feasibility of active surveillance according to contemporary criteria, and also suggests a potential role for active surveillance in selected men with intermediate risk features.""","""['Meelan Bul', 'Roderick C N van den Bergh', 'Xiaoye Zhu', 'Antti Rannikko', 'Hanna Vasarainen', 'Chris H Bangma', 'Fritz H Schröder', 'Monique J Roobol']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Long-term radical prostatectomy outcomes among participants from the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) Rotterdam.', 'Gleason score 7 screen-detected prostate cancers initially managed expectantly: outcomes in 50 men.', 'Outcomes of men with screen-detected prostate cancer eligible for active surveillance who were managed expectantly.', 'Active surveillance: the Canadian experience.', 'Management of localised prostate cancer: watchful waiting, surgery or radiation therapy, depending on the natural course, which is often relatively slow.', 'Prognostic Value of the Intermediate-risk Feature in Men with Favorable Intermediate-risk Prostate Cancer: Implications for Active Surveillance.', 'Comparison of Outcomes of Active Surveillance in Intermediate-Risk Versus Low-Risk Localised Prostate Cancer Patients: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'Active Surveillance in Intermediate-Risk Prostate Cancer: A Review of the Current Data.', 'Metastasis and Mortality in Men With Low- and Intermediate-Risk Prostate Cancer on Active Surveillance.', 'Active surveillance for intermediate-risk prostate cancer.']"""

Despite the significant worldwide impact of prostate cancer, few data are available specifically addressing satisfaction with treatment-related care.  Patients and methods:   CaPSURE comprises participants from 40 US sites who were monitored during and after their treatment course. Participants who were diagnosed with clinically localized prostate cancer after 1999 underwent radical prostatectomy, radiation therapy or primary androgen deprivation, and those who also completed the satisfaction questionnaire within 2 years of treatment were included in the present study. Satisfaction was measured using a validated instrument that assesses contact with providers, confidence in providers, communication skills, humanness and overall satisfaction. Multivariable linear regression analysis were performed to evaluate the independent relationships between demographic, clinical, treatment and patient-reported parameters and satisfaction.  Results:   Of the 3056 participants, 1927 (63%) were treated with radical prostatectomy, 843 (28%) were treated with radiation therapy and 286 (9%) were treated with primary androgen deprivation. Multivariable analysis showed that multiple patient-reported factors were independently associated with satisfaction, whereas clinical, demographic and treatment parameters were not. Baseline health-related quality of life, measured by the 36-item short-form health survey, baseline fear of cancer recurrence (all P < 0.01) and declines in the sexual (P = 0.03), urinary (P < 0.01) and bowel (P = 0.02) function domains of the University of California Los Angeles Prostate Cancer Index were all independently associated with satisfaction. Patient-reported outcomes were more strongly associated with satisfaction in the low-risk subgroup.

What's known on the subject? and What does the study add? High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) therapy has been proposed for the treatment of localized prostate cancer (PCa) for all risk levels of tumour recurrence. The study adds data on the efficacy of a single HIFU application in the treatment of PCa with different risks of recurrence. Durable cancer control was achieved in 81.7% of patients with low-risk disease, with rates of efficacy declining in intermediate- and high-risk tumours. The data suggest that the principal domain for minimal invasive HIFU should be low-risk disease.  Objective:   • To report cancer control results after a single application of high-intensity focused ultrasonography (HIFU) in patients with localized prostate cancer (PCa), stratified by tumour recurrence risk according to D'Amico risk classification.  Patients and methods:   • In a retrospective single-centre study, we analysed the outcomes of patients with localized PCa who were treated with curative intent between December 2002 and October 2006 using an Ablatherm HIFU device (EDAP-TMS, France). • Transurethral resection of the prostate or adenomectomy were performed before HIFU to downsize large prostate glands. • Oncological failure was determined by the occurrence of biochemical relapse, positive biopsy and/or metastasis. Biochemical relapse was defined as a PSA nadir +1.2 ng/mL (Stuttgart definition), or as a rise in PSA level to ≥ 0.5 ng/mL if PSA doubling time was ≤ 6 months. Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed for survival estimates.  Results:   • A total of 191 consecutive patients were included in the study. The median (range) patient age was 69.7 (51-82) years, and 38, 34 and 28% of these patients were in the low-, intermediate- and high-risk groups, respectively. • The median (range) follow-up was 52.8 (0.2-79.8) months. • At 5 years, overall and cancer-specific survival rates were 86.3% and 98.4%, respectively. • Stratified by risk group, negative biopsy rates were 84.2%, 63.6%, and 67.5% (P = 0.032), 5-year biochemical-free survival rates were 84.8%, 64.9% and 54.9% (P< 0.01), and 5-year disease-free survival rates were 81.7%, 53.2% and 51.2% (P < 0.01), respectively.  Conclusion:   • Single-session HIFU is recommended as a curative approach in elderly patients with low-risk PCa. Patients at higher risk of tumour progression should be counselled regarding the likely need for salvage therapy, including repeat HIFU.""","""['Dietrich Pfeiffer', 'Jürgen Berger', 'Andreas J Gross']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Editorial comment: Single application of high-intensity focused ultrasound as a first-line therapy for clinically localized prostate cancer: 5-year outcomes.', 'Single-session primary high-intensity focused ultrasonography treatment for localized prostate cancer: biochemical outcomes using third generation-based technology.', 'Evolution and outcomes of 3 MHz high intensity focused ultrasound therapy for localized prostate cancer during 15 years.', 'HIFU as salvage first-line treatment for palpable, TRUS-evidenced, biopsy-proven locally recurrent prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy: a pilot study.', 'High-intensity focused ultrasound for the treatment of localized prostate cancer: 5-year experience.', 'High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) for definitive treatment of prostate cancer.', 'Pre-Exposure to Stress-Inducing Agents Increase the Anticancer Efficacy of Focused Ultrasound against Aggressive Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Oncologic outcome, side effects and comorbidity of high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) for localized prostate cancer.

What's known on the subject? and What does the study add? Despite expanding treatment options for castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), therapies with long response duration remain intangible due to prostate cancer cells' natural ability to develop iterative resistance. Androgen receptor (AR) signaling has been shown to play a critical role in CRPC and its expression is regulated by the PI3K-Akt pathway. Thus inhibition of AR signalling and PI3K-Akt-mTOR (a downstream mediator of the PI3K-Akt pathway) pathway is a logical combination in CRPC and we report a phase II trial of RAD001 and bicalutamide. Our study is the first clinical trial report of an AR inhibitor of PI3K-Akt-mTOR. The AR pathway and the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway are two of the most relevant growth pathway for CRPC. Despite low efficacy results from our trial there will be significant interest in the field for these data (dose, schedule, response, toxicity, trial design) as newer generations of both AR inhibitors and PI3K-Akt-mTOR inhibitors are in development and likely will be tested in combination in CRPC.  Objectives:   • To determine best overall response and duration of response of RAD001, a selective inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin, in combination with bicalutamide in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). • To characterize the toxicity profile of RAD001 in combination with bicalutamide in patients with CRPC.  Patients and methods:   • A phase II study was conducted to explore the efficacy and tolerability of RAD001 (10 mg daily) in combination with bicalutamide (50 mg daily) in men with progressive CRPC. • The primary endpoint was a composite of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level and measurable disease response by standard criteria. • This single-stage trial with a sample size of 38 eligible patients provided 90% power to differentiate a response rate of ≥ 40% from a response rate of ≤ 20%, as expected for bicalutamide alone (α= 0.10, power = 0.90).  Results:   • In total, 36 men were enrolled, with a median (range) age of 68 (60-72) years and median (range) baseline PSA level of 22.2 (8.4-121.3) ng/mL, and 89% had metastatic disease. • There were 31 (86%) patients had previously used bicalutamide for a median duration of 7.4 months. • There were two patients with a confirmed PSA level decline ≥ 50%. • The median (interquartile range) time to progression was 8.7 (7.9-15.9) weeks. • The most common toxicity was grade 1/2 mucositis, which was observed in 20 (56%) patients.  Conclusion:   • The combination of RAD001 and bicalutamide in men with CRPC was well tolerated but had low activity and failed to achieve the primary endpoint of improved response compared to the results previously achieved for bicalutamide alone in this population.""","""['Mari Nakabayashi', 'Lilian Werner', 'Kevin D Courtney', 'Geoffrey Buckle', 'William K Oh', 'Glen J Bubley', 'Julia H Hayes', 'Douglas Weckstein', 'Aymen Elfiky', 'Danny M Sims', 'Philip W Kantoff', 'Mary-Ellen Taplin']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['A phase 2 clinical trial of everolimus plus bicalutamide for castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'A phase II study of GW786034 (pazopanib) with or without bicalutamide in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'An open-label, phase 2 trial of bicalutamide dose escalation from 50 mg to 150 mg in men with CAB and castration resistance.

However, the effects of genistein on the regulation of oncogenic microRNA-151 (miR-151) have not been reported. In this study, we investigated whether genistein could alter the expression of oncogenic miR-151 and its target genes that are involved in the progression and metastasis of prostate cancer (PCa). Real-time RT-PCR showed that the expression of miR-151 was higher in PC3 and DU145 cells compared with RWPE-1 cells. Treatment of PC3 and DU145 cells with 25 µM genistein down-regulated the expression of miR-151 compared with vehicle control. Inhibition of miR-151 in PCa cells by genistein significantly inhibited cell migration and invasion. In-silico analysis showed that several genes (CASZ1, IL1RAPL1, SOX17, N4BP1 and ARHGDIA) suggested to have tumor suppressive functions were target genes of miR-151. Luciferase reporter assays indicated that miR-151 directly binds to specific sites on the 3'UTR of target genes. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis showed that the mRNA expression levels of the five target genes in PC3 and DU145 were markedly changed with miR-151 mimics and inhibitor. Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank tests revealed that high expression levels of miR-151 had an adverse effect on survival rate.

SV119 is a synthetic small molecule that binds to sigma-2 receptors with high affinity and specificity. This study investigates the utility of SV119 in mediating the selective targeting of liposomal vectors in various types of cancer cells.  Methods:   SV119 was covalently linked with polyethylene glycol-dioleyl amido aspartic acid conjugate (PEG-DOA) to generate a novel functional lipid, SV119-PEG-DOA. This lipid was utilized for the preparation of targeted liposomes to enhance their uptake by cancer cells. Liposomes with various SV119 densities (0, 1, 3, and 5 mole%) were prepared and their cellular uptake was investigated in several tumor cell lines. In addition, doxorubicin (DOX) was loaded into the targeted and unmodified liposomes, and the cytotoxic effect on the DU-145 cells was evaluated by MTT assay.  Results:   Liposomes with or without SV119-PEG-DOA both have a mean diameter of approximately 90 nm and a neutral charge. The incorporation of SV119-PEG-DOA significantly increased the cellular uptake of liposomes by the DU-145, PC-3, A549, 201T, and MCF-7 tumor cells, which was shown by fluorescence microscopy and the quantitative measurement of fluorescence intensity. In contrast, the incorporation of SV119 did not increase the uptake of liposomes by the normal BEAS-2B cells. In a time course study, the uptake of SV119 liposomes by DU-145 cells was also significantly higher at each time point compared to the unmodified liposomes. Furthermore, the DOX-loaded SV119 liposomes showed significantly higher cytotoxicity to DU-145 cells compared to the DOX-loaded unmodified liposomes.  Conclusion:   SV119 liposomes were developed for targeted drug delivery to cancer cells. The targeting efficiency and specificity of SV119 liposomes to cancer cells was demonstrated in vitro. The results of this study suggest that SV119-modified liposomes might be a promising drug carrier for tumor-targeted delivery.""","""['Yifei Zhang', 'Yixian Huang', 'Peng Zhang', 'Xiang Gao', 'Robert B Gibbs', 'Song Li']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Int J Nanomedicine""","""['Using SV119-gold nanocage conjugates to eradicate cancer stem cells through a combination of photothermal and chemo therapies.', 'In vitro and in vivo evaluation of folate receptor-targeting amphiphilic copolymer-modified liposomes loaded with docetaxel.', 'Conjugation to the sigma-2 ligand SV119 overcomes uptake blockade and converts dm-Erastin into a potent pancreatic cancer therapeutic.', 'Therapeutic targeting of pancreatic cancer utilizing sigma-2 ligands.', 'Targeted Liposomes: A Nonviral Gene Delivery System for Cancer Therapy.', 'Functionalized liposomes for targeted breast cancer drug delivery.', 'Design and Investigation of a 18F-Labeled Benzamide Derivative as a High Affinity Dual Sigma Receptor Subtype Radioligand for Prostate Tumor Imaging.', 'SW43-DOX\xa0±\xa0loading onto drug-eluting bead, a potential new\xa0targeted drug delivery platform for systemic and locoregional cancer treatment - An in\xa0vitro evaluation.', 'Multifunctional, stimuli-sensitive nanoparticulate systems for drug delivery.', 'Targeted delivery of Doxorubicin by folic acid-decorated dual functional nanocarrier.']"""

Eleven patients with tumors of the head and neck, prostate and pelvis receiving carbon ion scanning beam treatment participated. The patient setup process takes orthogonal X-ray flat panel detector (FPD) images and the therapists adjust the patient table position in six degrees of freedom to register the reference position by manual or auto- (or both) registration functions. We calculated residual positional errors with the 2D-3D auto-registration function using the final patient setup orthogonal FPD images and treatment planning CT data.

We investigated whether use of ACs was associated with the risk of death from prostate cancer.  Patients and methods:   This study comprised 5,955 men in the Cancer of the Prostate Strategic Urologic Research Endeavor database with localized adenocarcinoma of the prostate treated with radical prostatectomy (RP) or radiotherapy (RT). Of them, 2,175 (37%) were receiving ACs (warfarin, clopidogrel, enoxaparin, and/or aspirin). The risk of prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM) was compared between the AC and non-AC groups.  Results:   After a median follow-up of 70 months, risk of PCSM was significantly lower in the AC group compared with the non-AC group (3% v 8% at 10 years; P < .01). The risks of disease recurrence and bone metastasis were also significantly lower. In a subgroup analysis by clinical risk category, the reduction in PCSM was most prominent in patients with high-risk disease (4% v 19% at 10 years; P < .01). The benefit from AC was present across treatment modalities (RT or RP). Analysis by type of AC medication suggested that the PCSM reduction was primarily associated with aspirin. Multivariable analysis indicated that aspirin use was independently associated with a lower risk of PCSM (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.21 to 0.87; P = .02).

The extent to which this increase reflects treatment of nonlethal disease detected through prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening is unknown.  Experimental design:   We undertook a nationwide study of all 18,837 patients with prostate cancer treated with radical prostatectomy in Sweden from 1988 to 2008 with complete follow-up through 2009. We compared cumulative incidence curves, fit Cox regression and cure models, and conducted a simulation study to determine changes in treatment of nonlethal cancer, in cancer-specific survival over time, and effect of lead-time due to PSA screening.  Results:   The annual number of radical prostatectomies increased 25-fold during the study period. The 5-year cancer-specific mortality rate decreased from 3.9% [95% confidence interval (CI), 2.5-5.3] among patients diagnosed between 1988 and 1992 to 0.7% (95% CI, 0.4-1.1) among those diagnosed between 1998 and 2002 (P(trend) < 0.001). According to the cure model, the risk of not being cured declined by 13% (95% CI, 12%-14%) with each calendar year. The simulation study indicated that only about half of the improvement in disease-specific survival could be accounted for by lead-time.  Conclusion:   Patients overdiagnosed with nonlethal prostate cancer appear to account for a substantial and growing part of the dramatic increase in radical prostatectomies in Sweden, but increasing survival rates are likely also due to true reductions in the risk of disease-specific death over time. Because the magnitude of harm and costs due to overtreatment can be considerable, identification of men who likely benefit from radical prostatectomy is urgently needed.""","""['Ruth Etzioni', 'Lorelei Mucci', 'Shu Chen', 'Jan-Erik Johansson', 'Katja Fall', 'Hans-Olov Adami']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Clin Cancer Res""","""['Active monitoring, radical prostatectomy and radical radiotherapy in PSA-detected clinically localised prostate cancer: the ProtecT three-arm RCT.', 'Radical prostatectomy versus watchful waiting in localized prostate cancer: the Scandinavian prostate cancer group-4 randomized trial.', 'Urban-rural differences in prostate cancer mortality, radical prostatectomy and prostate-specific antigen testing in Australia.', 'Laparoscopic and robotic-assisted versus open radical prostatectomy for the treatment of localised prostate cancer.', 'Importance of radical prostatectomy for patients older than 70 years.', 'microRNA-205 in prostate cancer: Overview to clinical translation.', 'Cause of Mortality after Radical Prostatectomy and the Impact of Comorbidity in Men with Prostate Cancer: A Multi-institutional Study in Korea.', 'MicroRNA 141 is associated to outcome and aggressive tumor characteristics in prostate cancer.', 'High miR-205 expression in normal epithelium is associated with biochemical failure - an argument for epithelial crosstalk in prostate cancer?', 'High expression of PDGFR-β in prostate cancer stroma is independently associated with clinical and biochemical prostate cancer recurrence.']"""

However, disease aggressiveness is varied, with low-grade disease often being indolent and high-grade cancer accounting for the greatest density of deaths. Outcomes are also disparate among men with high-grade prostate cancer, with upwards of 65% having disease recurrence even after primary treatment. Identification of men at risk for recurrence and elucidation of the molecular processes that drive their disease is paramount, as these men are the most likely to benefit from multimodal therapy. We previously showed that androgen-induced expression profiles in prostate development are reactivated in aggressive prostate cancers. Herein, we report the down-regulation of one such gene, Sparcl1, a secreted protein, acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC) family matricellular protein, during invasive phases of prostate development and regeneration. We further demonstrate a parallel process in prostate cancer, with decreased expression of SPARCL1 in high-grade/metastatic prostate cancer. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that SPARCL1 loss increases the migratory and invasive properties of prostate cancer cells through Ras homolog gene family, member C (RHOC), a known mediator of metastatic progression. By using models incorporating clinicopathologic parameters to predict prostate cancer recurrence after treatment, we show that SPARCL1 loss is a significant, independent prognostic marker of disease progression.

Recent studies have identified a new phenomenon involving the simultaneous generation of tens to hundreds of genomic rearrangements, called chromothripsis. To understand the molecular consequences of these events, we sequenced the genomes and transcriptomes of two prostate tumors exhibiting evidence of chromothripsis. We identified several complex fusion transcripts, each containing sequence from three different genes, originating from different parts of the genome. One such poly-gene fusion transcript appeared to be expressed from a chain of small genomic fragments. Furthermore, we detected poly-gene fusion transcripts in the prostate cancer cell line LNCaP, suggesting they may represent a common phenomenon. Finally in one tumor with chromothripsis, we identified multiple mutations in the p53 signaling pathway, expanding on recent work associating aberrant DNA damage response mechanisms with chromothripsis. Overall, our data show that chromothripsis can manifest as massively rearranged transcriptomes. The implication that multigenic changes can give rise to poly-gene fusion transcripts is potentially of great significance to cancer genetics.""","""['Chunxiao Wu', 'Alexander W Wyatt', 'Andrew McPherson', 'Dong Lin', 'Brian J McConeghy', 'Fan Mo', 'Robert Shukin', 'Anna V Lapuk', 'Steven J M Jones', 'Yongjun Zhao', 'Marco A Marra', 'Martin E Gleave', 'Stanislav V Volik', 'Yuzhuo Wang', 'S Cenk Sahinalp', 'Colin C Collins']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Genes Chromosomes Cancer""","""['Distinct classes of chromosomal rearrangements create oncogenic ETS gene fusions in prostate cancer.', 'In Brief: Chromothripsis and cancer.', 'Gene fusions by chromothripsis of chromosome 5q in the VCaP prostate cancer cell line.', 'The Diverse Effects of Complex Chromosome Rearrangements and Chromothripsis in Cancer Development.', 'Chromothripsis in cancer cells: An update.', 'Identification of DNA Damage Repair-Associated Prognostic Biomarkers for Prostate Cancer Using Transcriptomic Data Analysis.', 'DEEPrior: a deep learning tool for the prioritization of gene fusions.', 'Cellular and Molecular Mechanisms Underlying Prostate Cancer Development: Therapeutic Implications.', 'Telomeres and telomerase in prostate cancer development and therapy.', 'InFusion: Advancing Discovery of Fusion Genes and Chimeric Transcripts from Deep RNA-Sequencing Data.']"""

Quantitative reverse-transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) is the gold-standard for quantifying gene expression, and commonly employs a house-keeping gene (HKG) as an endogenous control to normalize results; the choice of which is critical for accurate data interpretation. Many factors, including sample type, pathological state, and oxygen levels influence gene expression including putative HKGs. The aim of this study was to determine the suitability of commonly used HKGs for qRT-PCR in prostate cancer.  Methods:   Prostate cancer (LNCaP, 22Rv1, PC3, and DU145) and normal (PWR1E and RWPE1) cell lines were cultured in air and hypoxia. The performance of 16 HKGs was assessed using Normfinder and coefficient of variation. In silico promoter analysis was performed to identify putative hypoxia response elements (HREs). The impact of the endogenous control on expression levels of HIF1A and GSTP1 was investigated by qRT-PCR in cell lines and tissue specimens respectively.  Results:   Hypoxia altered expression of several HKGs: IPO8, B2M, and PGK1. The most stably expressed HKGs were ACTB, PPIA, and UBC. Both UBC and ACTB showed constitutive expression of HIF1A in air and hypoxia, while PGK1 falsely implied a sixfold hypoxia-induced down-regulation. In prostate tumors, UBC and PGK1 both revealed down-regulation of GSTP1 relative to matched benign, whereas ACTB showed variability.  Conclusions:   This study demonstrates that no universal endogenous control exists for gene expression studies, even within one disease type. It highlights the importance of validating expression of intended HKGs between different sample types and environmental exposures.""","""['Alice Vajda', 'Laure Marignol', 'Ciara Barrett', 'Stephen F Madden', 'Thomas H Lynch', 'Donal Hollywood', 'Antoinette S Perry']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Docetaxel maintains its cytotoxic activity under hypoxic conditions in prostate cancer cells.', 'Human hormone-refractory prostate cancers can harbor mutations in the O(2)-dependent degradation domain of hypoxia inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha).', 'The relationship between proangiogenic gene expression levels in prostate cancer and their prognostic value for clinical outcomes.', 'Selection of housekeeping genes for use in quantitative reverse transcription PCR assays on the murine cornea.', 'Bax inhibitor-1 is overexpressed in prostate cancer and its specific down-regulation by RNA interference leads to cell death in human prostate carcinoma cells.', 'A reliable set of reference genes to normalize oxygen-dependent cytoglobin gene expression levels in melanoma.', 'Identification of a Transcriptomic Prognostic Signature by Machine Learning Using a Combination of Small Cohorts of Prostate Cancer.', 'Immune-focused multi-omics analysis of prostate cancer: leukocyte Ig-Like receptors are associated with disease progression.', 'Probing the prostate tumour microenvironment II: Impact of hypoxia on a cell model of prostate cancer progression.', 'Correlation of five secretory proteins with the nasopharyngeal carcinoma metastasis and the clinical applications.']"""

Methods:   In a retrospective, blinded manner, we histopathologically examined initial biopsies reported as AGSC (82 patients, 93 foci). On subsequent biopsies, 31 (38%)/5 (6%) patients were found to have prostate cancer (PCA)/AGSC, respectively, while no carcinoma (NOCA) was identified in the remainder (56%) of cases.  Results:   Nucleolar grade (on a scale of 1-4 with ""1"" denoting small, inconspicuous nucleoli and ""4"" denoting macronucleoli) was significantly higher in PCA cases than in NOCA cases whether comparing all AGSC foci (P = 0.006) or when considering the highest grade in each patient (P = 0.009). However, the number of AGSC per focus was similar (P = 0.926) between PCA (mean ± SD: 7.03 ± 5.35) and NOCA (mean ± SD: 7.13 ± 4.44). Adjacent (P = 0.117) and separate (P = 0.457) high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia was found in 8/37 (22%) foci and 12/31 (39%) cases in PCA, respectively, and in 4/48 (8%) foci and 13/46 (28%) cases in NOCA, respectively. The presence of intraluminal dense secretion, crystalloid, or mucin in AGSC did not show a statistically significant correlation between PCA [5/37 (14%)] and NOCA [10/48 (21%)] (P = 0.567).

Methods:   We investigated the associations of circulating retinol, vitamin E, and 1,25(OH)(2)D with PSA-detected prostate cancer risk, stage, and grade in a case-control study nested within the Prostate Testing for Cancer and Treatment (ProtecT) trial. We investigated the possibility of an interaction between 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)(2)D and whether the previously observed association between 25(OH)D and prostate cancer may be modified by retinol levels.  Results:   We included 1,433 prostate cancer cases and 1,433 healthy controls. There was no evidence of associations of circulating retinol, vitamin E, or 1,25(OH)(2)D with overall prostate cancer risk, stage (advanced vs localized), or Gleason grade (high- (≥7) vs low (<7) grade). There was no evidence of an interaction of 1,25(OH)(2)D and 25(OH)D with prostate cancer risk, stage, or grade (p interaction ≥ 0.24). The association between 25(OH)D and prostate cancer did not differ by retinol level (p interaction = 0.34).  Conclusions:   We found no evidence that retinol, vitamin E, or 1,25(OH)(2)D concentrations were associated with overall prostate cancer risk or more aggressive prostate cancer phenotypes.

RNAi-mediated knockdown of Sigma1 also results in translational repression, consistent with the effects of antagonist treatment.

Methods and materials:   In a prospective urologic cancer database, 765 patients underwent extraperitoneal laparoscopic radical prostatectomy for localized prostate cancer. The patients were categorized into 3 groups of body mass index (kg/m(2)): <25.0 (n = 276, 30%, ""normal weight""), 25.0 to 30.0 (n = 365, 48%, ""overweight"") and >30.0 (n = 124, 16%, ""obese""). We assessed the perioperative, oncological, and functional outcomes in this cohort of patients. Preoperative and postoperative evaluation of continence and erectile function were performed using validated questionnaires.  Results:   Mean operative time was significantly longer in obese patients (P < .001) and blood loss was also more important (P < .01). The obese patients had the highest likelihood of having aggressive tumors: nonorgan confined prostate cancer (49%, P = .002) and Gleason score ≥ 7 (80%, P = .005). The obese group had the higher positive surgical margins rate (overall: 27%, P = .012; pT2: 20%, P = .02). With a mean follow-up of 38 months, obesity was not an independent predictive factor of biochemical recurrence. At the 12-month follow-up, 85%, 74%, and 72% of normal, overweight, and obese men, respectively, were continent (no pad) (P = .04). At the 12-month follow-up, 57%, 58%, and 40% of normal, overweight, and obese men, respectively, reported an erection sufficient for intercourse (P = .01).

To examine a particular clinical concern regarding the possible impact of ADT on cognition, the current study combined neuropsychological testing with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to assess both brain activation during cognitive performance as well as the integrity of brain connectivity.  Methods:   In a prospective observational cohort analysis of men with non-metastatic prostate cancer at a Veterans Affairs medical center, patients receiving ADT were compared with patients not receiving ADT at baseline and at 6 months. Assessments included fMRI, the N-back task (for working memory), the stop-signal task (for cognitive control), and a quality of life questionnaire.  Results:   Among 36 patients enrolled (18 in each group), 30 completed study evaluations (15 in each group); 5 withdrew participation and 1 died. Results for the N-back task, stop-signal task, and quality of life were similar at 6 months vs. baseline in each group.

Therefore, the development of effective, systemic therapeutic approaches specifically based on the tumor microenvironment is highly desirable. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) is an attractive therapeutic target because it is a key transcription factor in tumor development and only accumulates in hypoxic tumors. We report here that a cationic mixed micellar nanoparticle (MNP) consisting of amphiphilic block copolymers poly(ε-caprolactone)-block-poly(2-aminoethylethylene phosphate) (PCL(29)-b-PPEEA(21)) and poly(ε-caprolactone)-block-poly(ethylene glycol) (PCL(40)-b-PEG(45)) was a suitable carrier for HIF-1α siRNA to treat hypoxic tumors, which showed an average diameter of 58.0 ± 3.4 nm. The complex MNP(siRNA), formed by the interaction of MNP and siRNA, was transfected into PC3 prostate cancer cells efficiently, while the inhibition of HIF-1α expression by MNP loaded with HIF-1α siRNA (MNP(siHIF)) blocked PC3 cell proliferation, suppressed cell migration and disturbed angiogenesis under in vitro hypoxic mimicking conditions. It was further demonstrated that systemic delivery of MNP(siHIF) effectively inhibited tumor growth in a PC3 prostate cancer xenograft murine model without activating innate immune responses. Moreover, delivery of MNP(siHIF) sensitized PC3 tumor cells to doxorubicin chemotherapy in vitro and in vivo by downregulating MDR1 gene expression which was induced by hypoxia. The underlying concept of use of MNP(siHIF) to block HIF-1α holds promise as an example of a clinical approach using specific siRNA therapy for cancer treatment aimed at the hypoxic tumor microenvironment.""","""['Xi-Qiu Liu', 'Meng-Hua Xiong', 'Xiao-Ting Shu', 'Rui-Zhi Tang', 'Jun Wang']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Mol Pharm""","""['Efficient siRNA delivery and tumor accumulation mediated by ionically cross-linked folic acid-poly(ethylene glycol)-chitosan oligosaccharide lactate nanoparticles: for the potential targeted ovarian cancer gene therapy.', 'N-acetylgalactosamine functionalized mixed micellar nanoparticles for targeted delivery of siRNA to liver.', 'A biodegradable amphiphilic and cationic triblock copolymer for the delivery of siRNA targeting the acid ceramidase gene for cancer therapy.', 'Small interfering RNA for cancer treatment: overcoming hurdles in delivery.', 'Galectin-1 as a potent target for cancer therapy: role in the tumor microenvironment.', 'Emerging nanotechnology-based therapeutics to combat multidrug-resistant cancer.', 'Appraisal for the Potential of Viral and Nonviral Vectors in Gene Therapy: A Review.', 'The regulation, function, and role of lipophagy, a form of selective autophagy, in metabolic disorders.', 'VHH212 nanobody targeting the hypoxia-inducible factor 1α suppresses angiogenesis and potentiates gemcitabine therapy in pancreatic cancer in vivo.', ""If it's not one thing, HIF's another: immunoregulation by hypoxia inducible factors in disease.""]"""

A widely pursued therapeutic target is the Androgen Receptor (AR). As a Steroid Hormone Receptor, AR serves as activator of transcription upon binding to androgens and plays a central role in the development of PCa. AR is a structurally flexible protein, and conformational plasticity of residues in the binding-pocket is a key to its ability to accommodate ligands from various chemical classes. Besides direct modulation of AR activity by antagonists, inhibition of cytochrome CYP17 (17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase), essential in androgen biosynthesis, has widely been considered an effective strategy against PCa. Interestingly, Handratta et al. (2005) discovered new, potent inhibitors of CYP17 (C-17 steroid derivatives) with pure AR antagonistic properties. Although the antiandrogenic activity of their lead compound (VN/124-1) has been experimentally proven both in vitro and in vivo, no structural data are currently available to elucidate the molecular determinants responsible for these desirable dual inhibitory properties. We implemented a Structure-based Drug Design (SBDD) approach to generate a valuable hypothesis as to the binding modes of steroidal CYP17 inhibitors/antiandrogens against the AR. To deal with the plasticity of residues buried in the Ligand Binding Domain (LBD), we developed a flexible-receptor Docking protocol based on Induced-Fit (IFD) methodology (www.schrodinger.com/).

To selectively target advanced prostate tumors with a constitutive activated PI3K/Akt pathway, a prostate cancer-specific PI3K inhibitor was generated by coupling the chemically modified form of the quercetin analogue LY294002 (HO-CH(2)-LY294002, compound 8) with the peptide Mu-LEHSSKLQL, in which the internal sequence HSSKLQ is a substrate for the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) protease.

Results:   Average uPSA value in the patients with benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) was 190.8 +/- 184.2 ng/mL. Average uPSA in the patients with PCa was 287.5 +/- 303.4 ng/ml and it was not significantly different from BPH group.

Conclusion:   The uPSA level reflects the response of normal prostatic and urethral secretory cells on total androgen activity. The uPSA level cannot distinguish the cases with BPH and cases with PCa.

Herein we report a case of advanced prostate cancer coexisting with asymptomatic Paget's disease.  Case report:   We present a 69-year-old patient, with biochemical recurrence two years after radical prostatectomy for localized prostate cancer and period of stable remission. During the evaluation of metastatic spread of prostate cancer, the bone scintigraphy with technetium diphosphonate showed diffuse areas of increased radiotracer uptake in the left leg long bones and focal changes in the axial part of the skeleton. Scintigraphic findings led to a differential diagnostic dilemma regarding etiology of bone changes, so it was supplemented by standard radiologic methods and laboratory evaluation of bone metabolism parameters. The existence of asymptomatic polyostotic Paget's disease and metastatic bone changes was found at the same time.

TNF receptor superfamily controls two distinct signalling cascades, leading to opposite effects, i.e. apoptosis and survival; in prostate cancer TNF-alpha-mediated signalling induces cell survival and resistance to therapy. The apoptosis of prostate epithelial cancer cells LNCaP and PC3 was investigated upon treatment with the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine and the autophagy inducer rapamycin, in combination with TNF-alpha. Cells were exposed to these molecules for 18, 24 and 48 h. Autophagy was assessed via LC3 Western blot analysis; propidium iodide and TUNEL stainings followed by flow cytometry or caspase-8 and caspase-3 activation assays were performed to evaluate apoptosis. TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis was potentiated by 3-methyladenine in the androgen-responsive LNCaP cells, whereas no effect was observed in the androgen-insensitive PC3 cells. Interestingly such pro-apoptosis effect in LNCaP cells was associated with reduced c-Flip levels through proteasomal degradation via increased reactive oxygen species production and p38 activation; such c-Flip reduction was reversed in the presence of either the proteasome inhibitor MG132 or the reactive oxygen species scavenger N-acetyl-cysteine. Conversely in PC3 but not in LNCaP cells, rapamycin stimulated TNF-alpha-dependent apoptosis; such effect was associated with reduced c-Flip promoter activity and FoxO3a activation. We conclude that TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis may be potentiated, in prostate cancer epithelial cells, through autophagy modulators. Increased sensitivity to TNF-alpha-dependent apoptosis correlates with reduced c-Flip levels which are consequent to a post-transcriptional and a transcriptional mechanism in LNCaP and PC3 cells respectively.""","""['Claudia Giampietri', 'Simonetta Petrungaro', 'Fabrizio Padula', ""Alessio D'Alessio"", 'Elettra Sara Marini', 'Antonio Facchiano', 'Antonio Filippini', 'Elio Ziparo']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Apoptosis""","""['Interleukin-8 signaling attenuates TRAIL- and chemotherapy-induced apoptosis through transcriptional regulation of c-FLIP in prostate cancer cells.', 'Pentagalloylglucose induces autophagy and caspase-independent programmed deaths in human PC-3 and mouse TRAMP-C2 prostate cancer cells.', 'FOXO3a mediates the androgen-dependent regulation of FLIP and contributes to TRAIL-induced apoptosis of LNCaP cells.', 'c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase-induced proteasomal degradation of c-FLIPL/S and Bcl2 sensitize prostate cancer cells to Fas- and mitochondria-mediated apoptosis by tetrandrine.', 'Modulation of apoptosis sensitivity through the interplay with autophagic and proteasomal degradation pathways.', 'Inhibition of c-FLIPL expression by miRNA-708 increases the sensitivity of renal cancer cells to anti-cancer drugs.', 'Broad targeting of resistance to apoptosis in cancer.', 'Paradoxical effects of the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine on docetaxel-induced toxicity in PC-3 and LNCaP prostate cancer cells.', 'The endogenous caspase-8 inhibitor c-FLIPL regulates ER morphology and crosstalk with mitochondria.', 'Roles of c-FLIP in Apoptosis, Necroptosis, and Autophagy.']"""

Eleven of them were also genotyped in a replication population of 1,093 AAs from Chicago. We tested for allelic association adjusting for age, global and local West African ancestry.

Achieving a nPSA ≤ 0.35 ng/mL was the only factor independently associated with long-term bDFS on both univariate (p = 0.000) and multivariate analysis (HR 3.82; p = 0.003).  Conclusions:   Patients attaining a nPSA ≤ 0.35 ng/mL are significantly more likely to experience long-term freedom-from-biochemical failure. Bounce PSA occurs in approximately 30% of patients. Time to onset of PSA increase seems the most reliable feature to distinguish bounce from failure. Tailored follow-up strategies are needed for patients at higher risk of recurrence, and caution is advised in interpreting an early increase in PSA levels in the first 24-30 months after BRT.""","""['Alessia Guarneri', 'Angela Botticella', 'Riccardo Ragona', 'Andrea Riccardo Filippi', 'Fernando Munoz', 'Giovanni Casetta', 'Paolo Gontero', 'Alessandro Tizzani', 'Umberto Ricardi']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""World J Urol""","""['PSA-nadir at 1 year as a sound contemporary prognostic factor for low-dose-rate iodine-125 seeds brachytherapy.', 'PSA nadir of <0.5 ng/mL following brachytherapy for early-stage prostate adenocarcinoma is associated with freedom from prostate-specific antigen failure.', 'Kinetics differences between PSA bounce and biochemical failure in patients treated with 125I prostate brachytherapy.', 'Four-year biochemical outcome after radioimmunoguided transperineal brachytherapy for patients with prostate adenocarcinoma.', 'Prostate cancer: Molecular lymph node analysis for prognostication.', 'Markers of Toxicity and Response to Radiation Therapy in Patients With Prostate Cancer.', 'PSA bounce after ¹²⁵I-brachytherapy for prostate cancer as a favorable prognosticator.', 'May non-metastatic clinically localized castration-resistant prostate cancer after primary androgen ablation benefit from salvage prostate radiotherapy?', 'PSA-nadir at 1 year as a sound contemporary prognostic factor for low-dose-rate iodine-125 seeds brachytherapy.']"""

Even though many studies have focused on single ETS factors within a single tissue and within the context of specific promoters, the functional impact of multiple ETS members present within a specific cell type has not yet been investigated, especially in prostate cancer (PCa). As the most prominent gene rearrangement in PCa leads to the overexpression of the ETS-related gene (ERG), the aim of this study was to investigate whether ERG is part of a complex integrated transcriptional network that involves other ETS factors. More specifically, as the ETS family consists of 27 members, we focused our efforts initially on investigating whether ERG is associated with the three family members, ETS-1, ETS-2 and ETS variant gene‑4 (ETV‑4), in PCa as a proof of principle. Using western blot analysis, we show that ERG, ETS-1, ETS-2 and ETV-4 are expressed in PC3 cell nuclear extracts and in protein lysates prepared from human PCa prostatectomy specimens. Immunoprecipitations using an anti-ERG antibody were used with PC3 cell nuclear extracts as well as with a pooled protein lysate sample prepared from the PCa tissue samples of five patients. Importantly, our results revealed that ERG is specifically associated with ETS-2 and ETV-4, but not with ETS-1, in PC3 cell nuclear extracts and PCa tissue protein lysates. Our findings strongly support the notion that ERG is part of a complex integrated transcriptional network that involves other ETS factors, which are likely to cooperate or influence the activity of ERG in PCa. The functional impact of multiple ETS factors being associated with ERG in PCa requires further study, as it may provide insights into the mechanism by which ERG exerts its influence in PCa and may subsequently contribute to our understanding of the molecular basis of PCa.""","""['David Adler', 'Jacqueline Ochsenfahrt', 'Kerstin Fuchs', 'Glen Kristiansen', 'Sven Perner', 'Nicolas Wernert']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Int J Mol Med""","""['The peripheral zone of the prostate is more prone to tumor development than the transitional zone: is the ETS family the key?', 'Binding of TMPRSS2-ERG to BAF Chromatin Remodeling Complexes Mediates Prostate Oncogenesis.', 'Differential expression of ETS family members in prostate cancer tissues and androgen-sensitive and insensitive prostate cancer cell lines.', 'ETS transcription factors and prostate cancer: the role of the family prototype ETS-1 (review).', 'The progress of TMPRSS2-ETS gene fusions and their mechanism in prostate cancer.', 'E26 transformation-specific variant 4 as a tumor promotor in human cancers through specific molecular mechanisms.', 'MTA1-Dependent Anticancer Activity of Gnetin C in Prostate Cancer.', 'Five ETS family members, ELF-1, ETV-4, ETV-3L, ETS-1, and ETS-2 upregulate human leukocyte-associated immunoglobulin-like receptor-1 gene basic promoter activity.', 'Structural insights into the autoregulation and cooperativity of the human transcription factor Ets-2.']"""

However, the methodology for economic evaluation aimed at informing decisions about pricing and reimbursement is different for cancer vaccines, such as HPV for preventing the occurrence or incidence of cancer, and immunotherapeutics for treatment of patients with manifest cancer. Vaccination against HPV is a traditional public health intervention, where the role of economic evaluation is to inform decisions about optimal vaccination strategies. The decision is about funding for a vaccination program, aimed at vaccinating a defined population at risk, either at a national or regional level. The methodology of economic evaluation is based on statistical modeling of number of cases prevented over a long time period, and the costs and health outcome related to this, for different vaccination strategies For immunotherapeutics, the role of economic evaluation is to assist decisions about reimbursement and guidelines for treatment of patients with establish disease, very often at advanced stages with short life expectancy. The focus is on alternative treatment options, and the costs and outcomes associated with these. Alternatives may be best supportive care, immunotherapeutics or other treatments like surgery, radiotherapy and other anti-cancer drugs. From an economic perspective the type of therapy does not matter, only costs and outcome associated with the relevant alternatives. The main controversy about reimbursement of immunotherapeutics, as with other new cancer drugs, has been the cost of treatment, mainly determined by the price of the therapy, in relation to the expected benefits in terms of survival and quality of life. This paper reviews the evidence on cost-effectiveness, the reimbursement decisions made, and the impact on market access for new immunotherapeutics.

Results from the SEARCH database""","""Background:   Obesity is associated with an increased risk of biochemical recurrence (BCR) after radical prostatectomy (RP). It is unclear whether this is due to technical challenges related to operating on obese men or other biologic factors.  Objective:   To examine whether obesity predicts higher prostate-specific antigen (PSA) nadir (as a measure of residual PSA-producing tissue) after RP and if this accounts for the greater BCR risk in obese men.  Design, setting, and participants:   A retrospective analysis of 1038 RP patients from 2001 to 2010 in the multicenter US Veterans Administration-based Shared Equal Access Regional Cancer Hospital database with median follow-up of 41 mo.  Intervention:   All patients underwent RP.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   We evaluated the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and ultrasensitive PSA nadir within 6 mo after RP. Adjusted proportional hazards models were used to examine the association between BMI and BCR with and without PSA nadir.  Results and limitations:   Mean BMI was 28.5 kg/m2. Higher BMI was associated with higher PSA nadir on both univariable (p=0.001) and multivariable analyses (p<0.001). Increased BMI was associated with increased BCR risk (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.06; p=0.007). Adjusting for PSA nadir slightly attenuated, but did not eliminate, this association (HR: 1.04, p=0.043). When stratified by PSA nadir, obesity only significantly predicted BCR in men with an undetectable nadir (p=0.006). Unfortunately, other clinically relevant end points such as metastasis or mortality were not available.  Conclusions:   Obese men are more likely to have a higher PSA nadir, suggesting that either more advanced disease or technical issues confound an ideal operation. However, even after adjusting for the increased PSA nadir, obesity remained predictive of BCR, suggesting that tumors in obese men are growing faster. This provides further support for the idea that obesity is biologically associated with prostate cancer progression.""","""['Tammy Ho', 'Leah Gerber', 'William J Aronson', 'Martha K Terris', 'Joseph C Presti', 'Christopher J Kane', 'Christopher L Amling', 'Stephen J Freedland']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Timing of Prostate-specific Antigen Nadir After Radical Prostatectomy and Risk of Biochemical Recurrence.', 'Assessing the Optimal Timing for Early Salvage Radiation Therapy in Patients with Prostate-specific Antigen Rise After Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Parameters derived from the postoperative decline in ultrasensitive PSA improve the prediction of radical prostatectomy outcome.', 'Prognostic Value of Biochemical Recurrence Following Treatment with Curative Intent for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review.', 'Obesity and biochemical recurrence in clinically localised prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis of 86,490 patients.', 'Post-diagnostic health behaviour scores and risk of prostate cancer progression and mortality.', 'Metabolic syndrome and its components predict the biochemical recurrence and adverse pathological features of patients following radical prostatectomy: a propensity score matching study.', 'Post-diagnostic health behaviour scores in relation to fatal prostate cancer.', 'Association of Obesity With Survival Outcomes in Patients With Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'Post-Diagnostic Dietary and Lifestyle Factors and Prostate Cancer Recurrence, Progression, and Mortality.']"""

Methods:   Parameters evaluated at diagnosis and at biopsy reclassification included serum prostate-specific antigen, prostate-specific antigen density, number of positive cores, maximum percent involvement of cancer per core, and any interval negative biopsies. Gleason upgrading at biopsy reclassification was also assessed to predict insignificant cancer.  Results:   Mean time between diagnosis and radical prostatectomies was 30.3 months with a median of 3 biopsies (range 2-9). Nineteen of 67 (28.4%) had clinically insignificant cancer at radical prostatectomy.

Adjusting for risk factors, there was a 22% lower risk of death in S9346 than in S8894 (HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.70, 0.87, p <0.001). The improvement in overall survival was greater in black American men (test of interaction p = 0.008). In S8494 and S8894 median survival for black men was 27 months, and 34 and 35 months for nonblack men, respectively. This racial difference disappeared in S9346 with overall survival of 48 and 49 months in black and nonblack men, respectively.  Conclusions:   Adjusting for risk factors, overall survival was significantly improved in the post-prostate specific antigen era trial. However, it cannot be concluded that this was attributable only to prostate specific antigen monitoring. Black men now have overall survival comparable to that of white men. Current estimates of survival should be used to design new trials in this population.""","""['Catherine M Tangen', 'Maha H A Hussain', 'Celestia S Higano', 'Mario A Eisenberger', 'Eric J Small', 'George Wilding', 'Bryan J Donnelly', 'Paul F Schelhammer', 'E David Crawford', 'Nicholas J Vogelzang', 'Isaac J Powell', 'Ian M Thompson Jr']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Prostate-specific antigen progression predicts overall survival in patients with metastatic prostate cancer: data from Southwest Oncology Group Trials 9346 (Intergroup Study 0162) and 9916.', 'Short-term androgen suppression and radiotherapy versus intermediate-term androgen suppression and radiotherapy, with or without zoledronic acid, in men with locally advanced prostate cancer (TROG 03.04 RADAR): 10-year results from a randomised, phase 3, factorial trial.', 'Burden of Metastatic Castrate Naive Prostate Cancer Patients, to Identify Men More Likely to Benefit from Early Docetaxel: Further Analyses of CHAARTED and GETUG-AFU15 Studies.', 'Early versus deferred androgen suppression in the treatment of advanced prostatic cancer.', 'Revisiting Intermittent Therapy in Metastatic Prostate Cancer: Can Less Be More in the ""New World Order""?', 'Impact of non-regional lymph node metastases accurately revealed on 18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT in the clinical management of metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer.', 'A role for laparoscopy in the age of robotics: a retrospective cohort study of perioperative outcomes between 2D laparoscopic radical prostatectomy vs 3DHD laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.', 'Evaluation of Social Determinants of Health and Prostate Cancer Outcomes Among Black and White Patients: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'Current status and future perspectives of the managements of metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer.', 'Metabolic profiling of prostate cancer in skeletal microenvironments identifies G6PD as a key mediator of growth and survival.']"""

Methods:   Flow cytometry (FACS) was used to detect suitable PCa cells and markers for detecting circulating tumor cells in vivo. We orthotopically injected androgen receptor-positive and androgen-independent C4-2B PCa cells into 12 severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mouse prostates, including 1 vehicle control. We measured the serum prostate-specific antigen levels biweekly after tumor inoculation. Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) were measured qualitatively by fluorescent microscopy immediately after the mice were sacrificed. The mouse prostates and lungs were examined for tumor formation using immunohistochemistry because we found no apparent metastasis, except in the lung.  Results:   FACS analyses in vitro identified the marker, prostate-specific membrane antigen, and C4-2B cells to be appropriate for additional in vivo study. We confirmed that the serum prostate-specific antigen increase was dependent on time and prostate tumor weight in mice. Of the 11 mice, 6 could be used as the mouse PCa xenograft model. Fluorescent microscopy detected CTCs in the peripheral blood in 5 of the 6 mice constituting the PCa model. Human prostate-specific antigen expression was detected by immunohistochemistry in the prostates of all the mice and in the lung of 2 of the 6 mice, suggesting 2 mice with lung metastasis.  Conclusion:   We have shown the potential establishment of a mouse lung metastatic xenograft model of androgen receptor-positive and androgen-independent C4-2B PCa tumor.

Patients and method:   Patients with normal digital rectal examination and a PSA level between 4 and 10 ng/mL were prospectively included. A multiparametric MRI of the prostate was performed prospectively before the biopsies. 12-core randomized biopsies were performed, with additional targeted samples in each suspicious area identified on MRI. Detected cancers and their histological characteristics were compared between those two biopsy protocols. A micro focal cancer (MFC) was defined by the presence of less than 4mm of Gleason score 3+3 cancer on a single core.  Results:   Seventy-one consecutive patients were included.

MRI-targeted biopsies alone detected three cancers, none of which was a MFC. 12-core biopsies alone detected 14 cancers, including ten MFC (71%).

In case of significant anatomical deformations, as in head and neck tumours (tumour shrinking and decrease in volume of the salivary glands), replanning appears to be necessary, corresponding to the adaptive radiotherapy. This should ideally be ""monitored"" and possibly triggered based on a calculation of cumulative dose, session after session, compared to the initial planning dose, corresponding to the concept of dose-guided adaptive radiotherapy. The creation of ""planning libraries"" based on predictable organ positions (as in cervical cancer) is another way of adaptive radiotherapy.
