These methods detect genomic alterations, nucleotide substitutions, insertions, deletions and copy number alterations. SOLiD (Sequencing by Oligonucleotide Ligation and Detection, Life Technologies) is a promising technology generating billions of 50 bp sequencing reads. This robust technique, successfully applied in gene identification, might be helpful in detecting novel genes associated with cancer initiation and progression using formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue. This study's aim was to compare the validity of whole exome sequencing of fresh-frozen vs. FFPE tumor tissue by normalization to normal prostatic FFPE tissue, obtained from the same patient. One primary fresh-frozen sample, corresponding FFPE prostate cancer sample and matched adjacent normal prostatic tissue was subjected to exome sequencing. The sequenced reads were mapped and compared. Our study was the first to show comparable exome sequencing results between FFPE and corresponding fresh-frozen cancer tissues using SOLiD sequencing. A prior study has been conducted comparing the validity of sequencing of FFPE vs. fresh frozen samples using other NGS platforms. Our validation further proves that FFPE material is a reliable source of material for whole exome sequencing.""","""['Roopika Menon', 'Mario Deng', 'Diana Boehm', 'Martin Braun', 'Falko Fend', 'Detlef Boehm', 'Saskia Biskup', 'Sven Perner']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Int J Mol Sci""","""['Whole exome sequencing (WES) on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue in gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST).', 'Comparison of Accuracy of Whole-Exome Sequencing with Formalin-Fixed Paraffin-Embedded and Fresh Frozen Tissue Samples.', 'Performance comparison of two commercial human whole-exome capture systems on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded lung adenocarcinoma samples.', 'Next-generation sequencing of RNA and DNA isolated from paired fresh-frozen and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples of human cancer and normal tissue.', 'Comparison of whole-exome sequencing of matched fresh and formalin fixed paraffin embedded melanoma tumours: implications for clinical decision making.', 'Rapid diagnosis of disseminated Mycobacterium mucogenicum infection in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimen using next-generation sequencing: A case report.', 'Mutational profiling of micro-dissected pre-malignant lesions from archived specimens.', 'Comparison of TCGA and GENIE genomic datasets for the detection of clinically actionable alterations in breast cancer.', 'Review of applications of high-throughput sequencing in personalized medicine: barriers and facilitators of future progress in research and clinical application.', 'Dissecting the Mutational Landscape of Cutaneous Melanoma: An Omic Analysis Based on Patients from Greece.']"""

In 2010, the first case reports of ONJ linked with denosumab administration were published.  Case description:   The authors describe a case of denosumab-related ONJ in a 73-year-old man with a diagnosis of prostatic adenocarcinoma, the treatment for which included the antiresorptive agent denosumab and who experienced severe pain and delayed healing after a mandibular molar extraction performed six months after the cessation of denosumab therapy. The patient had not received radiotherapy to the head and neck, nor had he received any bisphosphonate treatment.  Results:   Clinicians established a diagnosis of denosumab-related ONJ. Follow-up across 12 months revealed that the patient needed long-term courses of antibiotics and that he experienced progressive bone destruction requiring surgical debridement.  Conclusions:   and  Clinical implications:   The authors suggest that in patients receiving denosumab therapy, the dosing interval, the cumulative dose or both may be important in terms of the development of denosumab-related ONJ. This allows the hypothesis that preventive dentistry may reduce the prevalence of ONJ in those receiving denosumab as it has in those receiving bisphosphonates.""","""['Pedro Diz', 'José Luis López-Cedrún', 'Jorge Arenaz', 'Crispian Scully']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""J Am Dent Assoc""","""['Denosumab-associated osteonecrosis of the jaw--a case report.', 'Osteonecrosis of the jaw in a male osteoporotic patient treated with denosumab.', 'Stage 0 osteonecrosis of the jaw in a patient on denosumab.', 'Antiresorptive drug-related osteonecrosis of the jaw.', 'Case-Based Review of Osteonecrosis of the Jaw (ONJ) and Application of the International Recommendations for Management From the International Task Force on ONJ.', 'Osteoclast Recycling and the Rebound Phenomenon Following Denosumab Discontinuation.', 'Microgravity-Related Changes in Bone Density and Treatment Options: A Systematic Review.', 'Effect of Locally Administered Denosumab on Bone Graft Healing in Rabbit Critical-Size Calvarial Defects.', 'Locally Delivered Metabolite Derivative Promotes Bone Regeneration in Aged Mice.', 'A Systematic Analysis of the Available Human Clinical Studies of Dental Implant Failure in Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease.']"""

Recently, two studies demonstrated the time course of diabetes with prostate-specific antigen levels, which would be explained by the chronic renal complication. Therefore, we conducted a retrospective study to determine whether diabetic nephropathy is associated with prostate-specific antigen levels.  Methods and results:   Eligible patients were men aged ≥40 years, with type 2 diabetes and a recorded prostate-specific antigen level. Patients with a prior history of prostate cancer or prostatectomy or prostate-specific antigen level ≥10 ng/mL and patients with end-organ damage were excluded. Of the 247 patients included in the adjusted analysis, 51 (20.8 %) were diagnosed with diabetic nephropathy. A significant association of diabetic nephropathy with log-transformed prostate-specific antigen level was detected (Spearman's correlation coefficient -0.201, p = 0.003; adjusted for all other correlated variables) and fit into a linear regression model (B-coefficient -0.331, p = 0.003). Comparing diabetic nephropathy group with non-diabetic nephropathy group, the difference in log-transformed prostate-specific antigen levels was also significant (p = 0.002).

First, the in vitro apoptotic effects of Ad-REIC in normal and cancer cells derived from the prostate and liver were examined. Significant apoptotic effects were observed at 100 MOI (multiplicity of infection) in prostate cancer cells (LNCaP, PC3) and hepatoma cells (HEP3B and HEPG2); however, no effects were seen in normal cells. To analyze the safety of intraprostatic Ad-REIC administration, the biodistribution and histology after Ad-REIC injection were evaluated in various organs of normal male C57BL6 mice. In a supporting study, vector dissemination following intravenous injection of Ad-REIC into tail veins was determined. To evaluate whether Ad-REIC was present in the collected tissue specimens, human REIC gene detection was performed using DNA-PCR. Intraprostatic treatment administered at lower doses showed vector biodistribution into the colon, urinary bladder and prostate. At higher doses, vector dissemination was observed in tissues more distant from the prostate, including the lung, thymus, heart, liver and adrenal gland. After intravenous injection of Ad-REIC, dissemination was observed in the liver and spleen. These results indicate that the biodistribution of Ad-REIC is determined by the dose and route of administration. Although acute inflammatory effects were observed in the prostate after intraprostatic administration at higher doses, no abnormal histological findings were noted in the other tissues, including those of intravenously treated mice. Regarding the safety of Ad-REIC administration, no deaths and no signs of toxicity or unusual behavior were observed in the mice in any treatment group.

The effects of the extract on the cells were assessed by studying the cleavage of caspases and the target proteins of caspases. The increased expression of various cleaved caspases and changed expression of other proteins related in the apoptosis pathway were observed. 4'-6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) and immunofluorescence staining showed the cells undergoing apoptosis.

Hypoxia, a common phenomenon in solid tumors, is associated with a malignant cancer phenotype. Previous studies have proved that hypoxia facilitates cancer cell metastasis through upregulation of specific chemokine receptors. We hypothesized that hypoxia could upregulate CX3CR1 expression and lead to an increased chemotactic response to CX3CL1 in prostate cancer cells. In the present study, we found that CX3CR1 expression was significantly increased in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells, including DU145, PC-3 and PC-3M, following exposure to hypoxia. This upregulation of CX3CR1 corresponded to a significant increase in migration and invasion of prostate cancer cells under hypoxic conditions, which was attenuated after knocking down CX3CR1 expression. In addition, we examined the possible role of HIF-1 and NF-κB in the process of hypoxia-induced CX3CR1 expression and hypoxia-mediated metastasis. Attenuation of HIF-1 and NF-κB transcriptional activity by siRNAs or pharmacological inhibitors, abrogated hypoxia-induced upregulation of CX3CR1, and also prevented the migration and invasion of DU145 cells under a hypoxic environment. In summary, our study demonstrated that HIF-1 and NF-κB are essential for hypoxia-regulated CX3CR1 expression, which is associated with increased migratory and invasive potential of prostate cancer cells.

Research approach:   Descriptive, qualitative.  Setting:   Community setting.  Participants:   10 men with prostate cancer aged 62-70 years.  Methodologic approach:   A hermeneutic phenomenologic method using semistructured, open-ended questions addressing the lived experience.  Data synthesis:   Phenomenology of praxis proposed by van Manen guided the data analysis and transformed personal experiences into disciplinary understanding.  Findings:   The use of van Manen's method of inquiry and analysis has contributed to the findings of the study by providing a way to explore the meaning of the lived experiences in an attempt to understand living with prostate cancer. Several themes were identified: living in the unknown, yearning to understand and know, struggling with unreliability of body, bearing the diagnosis of cancer, shifting priorities in the gap, and feeling comfort in the presence of others.  Conclusions:   Oncology nurses can use van Manen's four fundamental existentials-lived space (spatiality), lived body (corporeality), lived time (temporality), and lived other (relationality)-to understand the lived experience of prostate cancer. Nurses have many opportunities to impact the lives of men diagnosed with prostate cancer, including diagnosis, management of physical integrity, management of psychosocial integrity, and providing education.

Whereas dephosphorylation was detected in the cytosolic pool of Akt, phosphorylation of the membrane pool of the kinase remained unaffected. Dephosphorylation of cytosolic Akt was attributed to an increase in the interaction between Akt and the catalytic subunit of the protein phosphatase PP2A, which correlated with an increase in the amount of the oxidized versus the reduced form of the kinase.

Calcitriol and its precursor calcidiol (25(OH)D3) are degraded by the 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 24-hydroxylase (CYP24A1). This enzyme is overexpressed in colorectal tumors, however, the mechanisms of this overexpression remain to be elucidated. CYP24A1 mRNA level differs among colorectal cancer cell lines and range from almost undetectable to high. Since DNA methylation and histone acetylation regulate CYP24A1 gene expression in prostate cancer cell lines, we investigated whether epigenetic mechanisms could explain the differences in basal expression of CYP24A1 in colon cancer cells. Methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (DAC) treatment resulted in an over 50-fold induction of CYP24A1 mRNA expression in Coga1A and HT-29 cells but in no response in Caco2/AQ and Coga13 cells. This finding is supported by a strong increase in CYP24A1 activity after DAC treatment in Coga1A (35%). In addition, calcitriol and DAC had synergistic effects on CYP24A1 gene transcription. Interestingly, the CYP24A1 promoter was not methylated in Coga1A and HT-29 (<5%), while in Caco2/AQ it was 62% methylated. This suggests that DNA demethylation must activate genes upstream of CYP24A1 rather than act on the gene itself. However, transcriptional regulators of CYP24A1 such as vitamin D receptor (VDR), retinoid X receptor (RXR), specificity protein 1 (SP1), or mediator complex subunit 1 (MED1) were not upregulated. We conclude that in colon cancer cells, CYP24A1 gene expression is inducible by methyltransferase and some histone deacetylase inhibitors in a cell line-dependent manner. This effect does not correlate with the methylation state of the promoter and therefore must affect genes upstream of CYP24A1.

We calculated the sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values for the GS of the biopsy specimens. We used Cohen's kappa to determine the degree of concordance between a GS of <7 and ≥7 for the biopsy specimen and the surgical specimen. Age, a family history of prostate cancer, total prostate-specific antigen (tPSA), digital rectal examination, prostate structure and volume, and the number of biopsy cores (biopsy scheme) were analyzed using multivariable logistic regression.  Results:   Histological study of biopsy specimens yielded high sensitivity (98%) but low specificity (49%) for GS ≤6 and low sensitivity (35, 26%) and high specificity (93, 99%) for GS=7 and GS ≥7, respectively. Cohen's kappa for the GS from the biopsy and surgical specimens was 0.43 (95% CI=30-56%). The biopsy scheme was the only predictor of discordance in the GS between the two techniques. Among the other variables included in the model, only tPSA showed a slightly significant association.

The aim of this study was to examine the mechanism of the antiproliferative activity of natural BRs 28-homocastasterone (28-homoCS) and 24-epibrassinolide (24-epiBL) in hormone-sensitive and -insensitive (LNCaP and DU-145, respectively) human prostate cancer cell lines. The effects of BRs on prostate cancer cells were surveyed using flow cytometry, Western blotting, TUNEL, DNA ladder assays and immunofluorescence analyses. The studied BRs inhibited cell growth and induced G(1) blocks in LNCaP cells accompanied by reductions in cyclin D(1), CDK4/6 and pRb expression. Following BR treatment of DU-145 cells, increases in proportions of cells in the G(2)/M phase of cell cycle were observed, accompanied by down-regulation of cyclins A and B(1). Changes in AR localization patterns in LNCaP cells treated with BRs were shown by immunofluorescence analysis. Furthermore, apoptotic detection methods demonstrated induction of apoptosis mediated by BRs in both cell lines, although changes in the expression of apoptosis-related proteins were modulated differently by 28-homoCS and 24-piBL in each cell line. The studied BRs seem to exert potent growth inhibitory and pro-apoptotic effects and could be therefore highly valuable new candidates for prostate anticancer drugs.""","""['Jana Steigerová', 'Lucie Rárová', ""Jana Oklešt'ková"", 'Kateřina Křížová', 'Monika Levková', 'Michaela Sváchová', 'Zdeněk Kolář', 'Miroslav Strnad']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Food Chem Toxicol""","""['Therapeutic Potential of Brassinosteroids in Biomedical and Clinical Research.', 'Brassinosteroids cause cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of human breast cancer cells.', 'Anticancer and antiproliferative activity of natural brassinosteroids.', 'Epibrassinolide-induced apoptosis regardless of p53 expression via activating polyamine catabolic machinery, a common target for androgen sensitive and insensitive prostate cancer cells.', 'SILAC-Based Mass Spectrometry Analysis Reveals That Epibrassinolide Induces Apoptosis via Activating Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress in Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Novel Steroidal17,16-dpyrimidines Derived from Epiandrosterone and Androsterone: Synthesis, Characterization and Configuration-Activity Relationships.', 'On the human health benefits of microalgal phytohormones: An explorative in silico analysis.', 'Molecular Basis of Prostate Cancer and Natural Products as Potential Chemotherapeutic and Chemopreventive Agents.', 'Synthesis and Biological Activity of Brassinosteroid Analogues with a Nitrogen-Containing Side Chain.', 'Therapeutic Potential of Brassinosteroids in Biomedical and Clinical Research.']"""

Inactivation of the tumour suppressor gene phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is prevalent in early PCa. The relationship of PTEN deficiency to inflammatory signalling remains to be characterised.  Objective:   To determine how loss of PTEN functionality modulates expression and efficacy of clinically relevant, proinflammatory chemokines in PCa.  Design, setting, and participants:   Experiments were performed in established cell-based PCa models, supported by pathologic analysis of chemokine expression in prostate tissue harvested from PTEN heterozygous (Pten(+/-)) mice harbouring inactivation of one PTEN allele.  Interventions:   Small interfering RNA (siRNA)- or small hairpin RNA (shRNA)-directed strategies were used to repress PTEN expression and resultant interleukin-8 (CXCL8) signalling, determined under normal and hypoxic culture conditions.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Changes in chemokine expression in PCa cells and tissue were analysed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), immunoblotting, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and immunohistochemistry; effects of chemokine signalling on cell function were assessed by cell cycle analysis, apoptosis, and survival assays.  Results and limitations:   Transient (siRNA) or prolonged (shRNA) PTEN repression increased expression of CXCL8 and its receptors, chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor (CXCR) 1 and CXCR2, in PCa cells. Hypoxia-induced increases in CXCL8, CXCR1, and CXCR2 expression were greater in magnitude and duration in PTEN-depleted cells. Autocrine CXCL8 signalling was more efficacious in PTEN-depleted cells, inducing hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) transcription and regulating genes involved in survival and angiogenesis. Increased expression of the orthologous chemokine KC was observed in regions displaying atypical cytologic features in Pten(+/-) murine prostate tissue relative to normal epithelium in wild-type PTEN (Pten(WT)) glands. Attenuation of CXCL8 signalling decreased viability of PCa cells harbouring partial or complete PTEN loss through promotion of G1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. The current absence of clinical validation is a limitation of the study.  Conclusions:   PTEN loss induces a selective upregulation of CXCL8 signalling that sustains the growth and survival of PTEN-deficient prostate epithelium.""","""['Pamela J Maxwell', 'Jonathan Coulter', 'Steven M Walker', 'Melanie McKechnie', 'Jessica Neisen', 'Nuala McCabe', 'Richard D Kennedy', 'Manuel Salto-Tellez', 'Chris Albanese', 'David J J Waugh']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['CXCL8, an underestimated ""bad guy"" in prostate cancer.', 'Tumor-derived CXCL8 signaling augments stroma-derived CCL2-promoted proliferation and CXCL12-mediated invasion of PTEN-deficient prostate cancer cells.', 'HIF-1 and NF-kappaB-mediated upregulation of CXCR1 and CXCR2 expression promotes cell survival in hypoxic prostate cancer cells.', 'CXCL8, an underestimated ""bad guy"" in prostate cancer.', 'The CXCL8-CXCR1/2 pathways in cancer.', 'An updated review on the role of the CXCL8-CXCR1/2 axis in the progression and metastasis of breast cancer.', 'Immunogenomic profiles associated with response to life-prolonging agents in prostate cancer.', 'The value of CT findings combined with inflammatory indicators for preoperative differentiation of benign and malignant gallbladder polypoid lesions.', 'Cancer-cell-intrinsic mechanisms shaping the immunosuppressive landscape of prostate cancer.', 'PTEN-knockout regulates metabolic rewiring and epigenetic reprogramming in prostate cancer and chemoprevention by triterpenoid ursolic acid.', 'Non-canonical EphA2 activation underpins PTEN-mediated metastatic migration and poor clinical outcome in prostate cancer.']"""

Method:   According to the national cancer registry, 7599 new cancer cases were recorded within 22 districts of Tehran in 2008. Based on combined data from census and a population-based health equity study (Urban HEART), socioeconomic position (SEP) was calculated for each district. Index of disparity, absolute and relative concentration indices (ACI and RCI) were used for measuring disparities in cancer incidence.  Results:   The overall cancer age standardised rate (ASR) was 117.2 per 100,000 individuals (120.4 for men and 113.5 for women). Maximum ASR in both genders was seen in districts 6, 3, 1 and 2. Breast, colorectal, stomach, skin and prostate were the most common cancers. Districts with higher SEP had higher ASR (r=0.9, p<0.001). Positive ACI and RCI indicated that cancer cases accumulated in districts with high SEP. Female disparity was greater than for men in all measures. Breast, colorectal, prostate and bladder ASR ascended across SEP groups. Negative ACI and RCI in cervical and skin cancers in women indicate their aggregation in lower SEP groups. Breast cancer had the highest absolute disparities measure.

It has been reported that activation of Notch-1 contributes to tumorigenesis. However, whether Notch signaling might have a role in chemoresistance of prostate cancer is unclear. This study aimed to investigate the effects of Notch-1 silencing on the sensitivity of prostate cancer cells to docetaxel treatment.  Methods:   siRNA against Notch-1 was transfected into PC-3 prostate cancer cells. Proliferation, apoptosis and cell cycle distribution were examined in the presence or absence of docetaxel by MTT and flow cytometry. Expression of p21(waf1/cip1) and Akt as well as activation of Akt in PC-3 cells were detected by Western blot and Real-time PCR.  Results:   Silencing of Notch-1 promoted docetaxel induced cell growth inhibition, apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in PC-3 cells. In addition, these effects were associated with increased p21(waf1/cip1) expression and decreased Akt expression and activation in PC-3 cells.

These tumors have been shown to express SOX2 and overexpression of SOX2 has been correlated with poor prognosis. Although knockdown of SOX2 impairs the growth and tumorigenicity of brain tumor cells, it was unclear how elevating SOX2 levels would affect their fate. Interestingly, studies conducted with neural stem cells have shown that small increases or decreases in the level of this transcription factor significantly alter their fate. Here, we report that elevating SOX2 3-fold above endogenous levels in U87 and U118 glioblastoma, and DAOY medulloblastoma cells significantly impairs their ability to proliferate. We extended these findings and determined that elevating SOX2 in DAOY cells remodels their cell-cycle profile by increasing the proportion of cells in the G1-compartment, and induces the expression of genes associated with differentiation. Furthermore, we show that elevating SOX2 leads to a dramatic induction of CD133 expression in DAOY cells, yet inhibits the ability of both CD133(+) and CD133(-) cells to form neurospheres. Together, these findings argue that SOX2 levels must be carefully controlled in glioblastomas and medulloblastomas to maintain their fate. Equally important, our data suggests that increases in the expression of SOX2 during brain tumor progression are likely to be linked closely with changes in other critical genes that work in concert with SOX2 to enhance the tumorigenicity of brain tumors. Importantly, we demonstrate that this is also likely to be true for other cancers that express SOX2. Moreover, these studies demonstrate the advantage of using inducible promoters to study the effects of SOX2 elevation, as compared to gene expression systems that rely on constitutive expression.""","""['Jesse L Cox', 'Phillip J Wilder', 'Michelle Desler', 'Angie Rizzino']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Members of the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related proteins provide a differential molecular signature between parental and CD133+ DAOY medulloblastoma cells.', 'Sox2, a stemness gene, regulates tumor-initiating and drug-resistant properties in CD133-positive glioblastoma stem cells.', 'Molecular analysis of ex-vivo CD133+ GBM cells revealed a common invasive and angiogenic profile but different proliferative signatures among high grade gliomas.', 'CD133 as a marker for regulation and potential for targeted therapies in glioblastoma multiforme.', 'Glioblastoma cancer stem cells--from concept to clinical application.', 'Interrogating the precancerous evolution of pathway dysfunction in lung squamous cell carcinoma using XTABLE.', 'Elevating SOX2 Downregulates MYC through a SOX2:MYC Signaling Axis and Induces a Slowly Cycling Proliferative State in Human Tumor Cells.', 'Subgroup-Specific Diagnostic, Prognostic, and Predictive Markers Influencing Pediatric Medulloblastoma Treatment.', 'SOX transcription factors and glioma stem cells: Choosing between stemness and differentiation.', 'Tumor quiescence: elevating SOX2 in diverse tumor cell types downregulates a broad spectrum of the cell cycle machinery and inhibits tumor growth.']"""

The enzyme is also over-expressed in prostate and breast cancer and its expression is correlated with the aggressiveness of the disease. The steroid products of AKR1C3 catalysis are important in proliferative signalling of hormone-responsive cells, while the prostanoid products promote prostaglandin-dependent proliferative pathways. In these ways, AKR1C3 contributes to tumour development and maintenance, and suggest that inhibition of AKR1C3 activity is an attractive target for the development of new anti-cancer therapies. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are one well-known class of compounds that inhibits AKR1C3, yet crystal structures have only been determined for this enzyme with flufenamic acid, indomethacin, and closely related analogues bound. While the flufenamic acid and indomethacin structures have been used to design novel inhibitors, they provide only limited coverage of the NSAIDs that inhibit AKR1C3 and that may be used for the development of new AKR1C3 targeted drugs. To understand how other NSAIDs bind to AKR1C3, we have determined ten crystal structures of AKR1C3 complexes that cover three different classes of NSAID, N-phenylanthranilic acids (meclofenamic acid, mefenamic acid), arylpropionic acids (flurbiprofen, ibuprofen, naproxen), and indomethacin analogues (indomethacin, sulindac, zomepirac). The N-phenylanthranilic and arylpropionic acids bind to common sites including the enzyme catalytic centre and a constitutive active site pocket, with the arylpropionic acids probing the constitutive pocket more effectively. By contrast, indomethacin and the indomethacin analogues sulindac and zomepirac, display three distinctly different binding modes that explain their relative inhibition of the AKR1C family members.

This effect of OXT has been shown to be mediated by Gi/oα-dependent signaling. Accordingly, OXT inhibited forskolin-induced luciferase activity in PC3 cells that were transfected with a luciferase reporter for cyclic AMP activity. Although mRNAs for all three Giα isoforms were present in PC3 cells, Giα2 was the most abundant isoform that was detected at the protein level. Pertussis toxin (PTx) inhibited the OXT-induced migration of PC3 cells. Ectopic expression of the PTx-resistant Giα2-C352G, but not wild-type Giα2, abolished this effect of PTx on OXT-induced cell migration. The Giα2-targeting siRNA was shown to specifically reduce Giα2 mRNA and protein in prostate cancer cells. The Giα2-targeting siRNA eliminated OXT-induced migration of PC3 cells. These data suggest that Giα2 plays an important role in the effects of OXT on PC3 cell migration. The Giα2-targeting siRNA also inhibited EGF-induced migration of PC3 and DU145 cells. Expression of the siRNA-resistant Giα2, but not wild type Giα2, restored the effects of EGF in PC3 cells transfected with the Giα2-targeting siRNA.

Increased serum and tumor tissue levels of copper are also observed in several cancers, although little is known about how the metal might promote disease progression at the molecular level. In the current study, we investigated whether copper might regulate the ectodomain shedding of two key cell surface proteins implicated in the invasion and metastasis of prostate cancer, the Notch ligand Jagged1 and the adhesion molecule E-cadherin, and whether the metal was able to influence the invasion of the prostate cancer epithelial cell line PC3. Physiological copper concentrations stimulated the ZMP-mediated proteolysis of Jagged1 and E-cadherin in cell culture models, whereas other divalent metals had no effect. Copper-mediated Jagged1 proteolysis was also observed following the pretreatment of cells with cycloheximide and in a cell-free membrane system, indicating a posttranslational mechanism of sheddase activation. Finally, the concentrations of copper that stimulated ZMP-mediated protein shedding also enhanced PC3 invasion; an effect that could be negated using a sheddase inhibitor or copper chelators.

A genome-wide association study (GWAS) has identified two loci, SHBG at 17p13 and FAM9B at Xp22, for serum testosterone (T) levels; however, these explain only a small fraction of inter-individual variability. To identify additional genetic determinants of androgen levels, a GWAS of baseline serum T and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) levels was conducted in 3225 men of European ancestry from the REduction by DUtasteride of Prostate Cancer Events (REDUCE) study. Cross-validation was used to confirm the observed associations between the drug (n = 1581) and placebo (n = 1644) groups of REDUCE.

Moreover, two additional variants in SHBG [rs72829446, in strong linkage equilibrium with the missense variant D356N (rs6259), and rs1799941] were also independently associated with circulating androgen levels in a statistical scale. These three loci (JMJD1C, SHBG and FAM9B) were estimated to account for ~5.3 and 4.1% of the variance of serum T and DHT levels.

Docetaxel was given at a dose of 70 mg/m(2) once every 3 weeks or 35 mg/m(2) twice every 3 weeks. Oral estramustine 560 mg was given concurrently for five consecutive days during weeks 1 and 2 of each cycle, and prednisolone 10 mg was given every day.

Thirty-nine of the 44 patients (89%) had evidence of bone metastases. By histomorphometric analysis, these bone metastases were associated with a range of bone responses from osteoblastic to osteolytic with a wide spectrum of bone responses often seen within an individual patient. Overall, the average bone volume/tissue volume (BV/TV) was 25.7%, confirming the characteristic association of an osteoblastic response to prostate cancer bone metastasis when compared with the normal age-matched weighted mean BV/TV of 14.7%. The observed new bone formation was essentially woven bone, and this was a localized event. In comparing BV/TV at metastatic sites between patients who had received BP treatment and those who had not, there was a significant difference (28.6% versus 19.3%, respectively). At bone sites that were not invaded by tumor, the average BV/TV was 10.1%, indicating significant bone loss owing to ADT that was not improved (11%) in those patients who had received BPs. Surprisingly, there was no significant difference in the number of osteoclasts present at the metastatic sites between patients treated or not treated with BPs, but in bone sites where the patient had been treated with BPs, giant osteoclasts were observed.

Cancer cells rely on Hsp90 to chaperone mutated and/or activated oncoproteins, and its involvement in numerous signaling pathways makes it an attractive target for drug development. Surprisingly, however, the impact of Hsp90 inhibitors on cancer cells is frequently cytostatic in nature, and efforts to enhance the antitumor activity of Hsp90 inhibitors in the clinic remain a significant challenge. In agreement with previous data obtained using Wee1 siRNA, we show that dual pharmacologic inhibition of Wee1 tyrosine kinase and Hsp90 causes cancer cells to undergo apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. Gene expression profiling revealed that induction of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway by this drug combination coincided with transcriptional downregulation of Survivin and Wee1, an outcome not seen in cells treated separately with either agent. At the translational level, expression of these two proteins, as well as activated Akt, was completely abrogated. These data support the hypothesis that Wee1 inhibition sensitizes cancer cells to Hsp90 inhibitors; they establish combined Wee1/Hsp90 inhibition as a novel therapeutic strategy; and they provide a mechanistic rationale for enhancing the pro-apoptotic activity of Hsp90 inhibitors.""","""['Aki Iwai', 'Dimitra Bourboulia', 'Mehdi Mollapour', 'Sandra Jensen-Taubman', 'Sunmin Lee', 'Alison C Donnelly', 'Soichiro Yoshida', 'Naoto Miyajima', 'Shinji Tsutsumi', 'Armine K Smith', 'David Sun', 'Xiaolin Wu', 'Brian S Blagg', 'Jane B Trepel', 'William G Stetler-Stevenson', 'Len Neckers']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Cell Cycle""","""['Wee1-Hsp90 inhibitor combination treatment: molecular therapy with potentially broad applicability.', '90-kDa heat shock protein inhibition abrogates the topoisomerase I poison-induced G2/M checkpoint in p53-null tumor cells by depleting Chk1 and Wee1.', 'Swe1Wee1-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of Hsp90 regulates distinct facets of chaperone function.', 'Inhibition of Wee1, AKT, and CDK4 underlies the efficacy of the HSP90 inhibitor XL888 in an in vivo model of NRAS-mutant melanoma.', 'Drug-mediated targeted disruption of multiple protein activities through functional inhibition of the Hsp90 chaperone complex.', 'Hsp90 inhibitors as novel cancer chemotherapeutic agents.', 'Synthetic and Medicinal Chemistry Approaches Toward WEE1 Kinase Inhibitors and Its Degraders.', 'Patient-specific Boolean models of signalling networks guide personalised treatments.', 'Wee1 Kinase: A Potential Target to Overcome Tumor Resistance to Therapy.', 'Post-translational modifications of Hsp90 and translating the chaperone code.', 'The Multiple Roles and Therapeutic Potential of Molecular Chaperones in Prostate Cancer.']"""

Herein they describe the recent emergence of molecular pathological epidemiology (MPE), which represents an integration of population and molecular biologic science to gain insights into the etiologies, pathogenesis, evolution, and outcomes of complex multifactorial diseases. Most human diseases, including common cancers (such as breast, lung, prostate, and colorectal cancers, leukemia, and lymphoma) and other chronic diseases (such as diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, autoimmune diseases, psychiatric diseases, and some infectious diseases), are caused by alterations in the genome, epigenome, transcriptome, proteome, metabolome, microbiome, and interactome of all of the above components. In this era of personalized medicine and personalized prevention, we need integrated science (such as MPE) which can decipher diseases at the molecular, genetic, cellular, and population levels simultaneously. The authors believe that convergence and integration of multiple disciplines should be commonplace in research and education.

What's known on the subject? and What does the study add? Despite a lack of randomised controlled trials, most men with locally advanced prostate cancer are recommended to undergo external beam radiotherapy (EBRT), often combined with long-term androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT). Many of these men are not offered radical prostatectomy (RP) by their treating urologist. Additionally, it is know that EBRT with long-term ADT does provide good cancer control (88% at 10 years). We have previously published intermediate-term follow-up of a large series of men treatment with RP for cT3 prostate cancer. We report long-term follow-up of a large series of men treated with RP as primary treatment for cT3 prostate cancer. Our study shows that with long-term follow-up RP provides excellent oncological outcomes even at 20 years. While most men do require a multimodal treatment approach, many men can be managed successfully with RP alone.  Objective:   • To present long-term survival outcomes after radical prostatectomy (RP) for patients with cT3 prostate cancer, as the optimal treatment for patients with clinical T3 prostate cancer is debated.  Patients and methods:   • We identified 843 men who underwent RP for cT3 tumours between 1987 and 1997. • Survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. • Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to evaluate the association of clinicopathological features with outcome  Results:   • The median (range) postoperative follow-up was 14.3 (0.1-23.5) years. • Down-staging to pT2 disease occurred in 26% (223/843) at surgery. • Local recurrence-free, systemic progression-free and cancer-specific survival for men with cT3 prostate cancer after RP was 76%, 72%, and 81%, respectively, at 20 years. • On multivariate analysis, increasing RP Gleason score (hazard ratio [HR] 1.8; P = 0.01), non-diploid chromatin content (HR 1.8; P = 0.01), positive surgical margins (HR 2.1; P = 0.007), and seminal vesicle invasion (HR 2.1; P = 0.005) were associated with a significant risk of prostate cancer death, while a more recent year of surgery was associated with a decreased risk of cancer-specific mortality (HR 0.88; P = 0.01)  Conclusions:   • RP affords accurate pathological staging and may be associated with durable cancer control for cT3 prostate cancer, with 20 years of follow-up presented here. • RP as part of a multimodal treatment strategy therefore remains a viable treatment option for patients with cT3 tumours.""","""['Christopher R Mitchell', 'Stephen A Boorjian', 'Eric C Umbreit', 'Laureano J Rangel', 'Rachel E Carlson', 'R Jeffrey Karnes']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Re: 20-year survival after radical prostatectomy as initial treatment for cT3 prostate cancer.', 'Radical prostatectomy for clinically advanced (cT3) prostate cancer since the advent of prostate-specific antigen testing: 15-year outcome.', 'Impact of positive surgical margins on prostate-specific antigen failure after radical prostatectomy in adjuvant treatment-naïve patients.', 'Radical prostatectomy represents an effective treatment in patients with specimen-confined high pathological Gleason score prostate cancer.', 'Long-term oncological outcomes after laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.', 'A critical analysis of the long-term impact of radical prostatectomy on cancer control and function outcomes.', 'Outcomes of radical prostatectomy in a 20-year localized prostate cancer single institution series in China.', 'Propensity score matching analysis comparing radical prostatectomy and radiotherapy with androgen deprivation therapy in locally advanced prostate cancer.', 'Long-term oncologic outcomes after radical prostatectomy in clinically localized prostate cancer: 10-year follow-up in Korea.', 'Dramatic polarization in genitourinary expert opinions regarding the clinical utility of positron emission tomography (PET) imaging in prostate cancer.', 'Elderly patients aged ≥\u200975\xa0years with locally advanced prostate cancer may benefit from local treatment: a population-based propensity score-adjusted analysis.']"""

We use a prostate cancer prognosis study as an example to demonstrate that solely recruiting more patient samples may not increase power for biomarker detection at all. In response to the heterogeneity due to mixed tissue, we developed a sample selection strategy termed Stepwise Enrichment by which samples are systematically culled based on tumor content and analyzed with t-test to determine an optimal threshold for tissue percentage. The selected tissue-percentage threshold identified the most significant data by balancing the sample size and the sample homogeneity; therefore, the power is substantially increased for identifying the prognostic biomarkers in prostate tumor epithelium cells as well as in prostate stroma cells.

Methods:   After transfecting PC-3 cells with ADAM17-siRNA 1 and ADAM17-siRNA 2, we detected the expressions of ADAM17 mRNA and protein by RT- PCR and Western blotting, respectively. We measured the changes in the proliferation and DNA synthesis of PC-3 cells by MTT and bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation assay, examined the cell cycle profile by flow cytometry, and determined the expressions of the genes associated with PC-3 cell proliferation by Western blotting.  Results:   Both ADAM17-siRNA 1 and 2 effectively reduced the expressions of ADAM17 mRNA and protein in the PC-3 cells. Knockdown of ADAM17 with the two siRNAs significantly inhibited cell proliferation as compared with the control group (0.43 +/- 0.57 and 0.44 +/- 0.64 vs 0.80 +/- 0.51, P < 0.05) and down-regulated DNA synthesis (0.48 +/- 0.43 and 0.54 +/- 0.59 vs 0.79 +/- 0.72, P < 0.05).

Subcellular localization assays designed to span the entire open-reading frame of the PRMT5 protein revealed the presence of three nuclear exclusion signals (NESs) in the PRMT5 protein. PRMT5 and p44/MED50/WD45/WDR77 co-localize in the cytoplasm, and both are required for the growth of prostate cancer cells in an PRMT5 methyltransferase activity-dependent manner. In contrast, PRMT5 in the nucleus inhibited cell growth in a methyltransferase activity-independent manner. Consistent with these observations, PRMT5 localized in the nucleus in benign prostate epithelium, whereas it localized in the cytoplasm in prostate premalignant and cancer tissues. We further found that PRMT5 alone methylated both histone H4 and SmD3 proteins but PRMT5 complexed with p44 and pICln methylated SmD3 but not histone H4.

Design:   Four cohort studies comparing people with and without learning disability, within the recommended age ranges for cancer screening in the UK. We used Poisson regression to determine relative incidence rates of cancer screening.  Setting:   The Health Improvement Network, a UK primary care database with over 450 General practices.  Participants:   Individuals with a recorded diagnosis of learning disability including general diagnostic terms, specific syndromes, chromosomal abnormalities and autism in their General Practitioner computerised notes. For each type of cancer screening, a comparison cohort of up to six people without learning disability was selected for each person with a learning disability, using stratified sampling on age within GP practice.  Main outcome measures:   Incidence rate ratios for receiving 1) a cervical smear test, 2) a mammogram, 3) a faecal occult blood test and 4) a prostate specific antigen test.  Results:   Relative rates of screening for all four cancers were significantly lower for people with learning disability. The adjusted incidence rate ratios (95% confidence intervals) were Cervical smears: Number eligible with learning disability = 6,254; IRR = 0.54 (0.52-0.56).

Differences in screening rates were less pronounced in more socially deprived areas. Disparities in cervical screening rates narrowed over time, but were 45% lower in 2008/9, those for breast cancer screening appeared to widen and were 35% lower in 2009.

Emerging evidence also suggest that hypoxia and HIF signaling pathways contributes to the acquisition of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), maintenance of cancer stem cell (CSC) functions, and also maintains the vicious cycle of inflammation, all of which contribute to radiation therapy and chemotherapy resistance. However, the detailed mechanisms by which hypoxia/HIF drive these events are not fully understood. Here, we have shown that hypoxia leads to increased expression of VEGF, IL-6, and CSC marker genes such as Nanog, Oct4 and EZH2, and also increased the expression of miR-21, an oncogenic miRNA, in prostate cancer (PCa) cells (PC-3 and LNCaP). The treatment of PCa cells with CDF, a novel Curcumin-derived synthetic analogue previously showed anti-tumor activity in vivo, inhibited the productions of VEGF and IL-6, and down-regulated the expression of Nanog, Oct4, EZH2 mRNAs, as well as miR-21 under hypoxic condition.

Stromal cells present in the tumor microenvironment express high levels of CXCL12 protein, directly stimulating proliferation and migration of CXCR4-expressing cancer cells. This specific prosurvival influence of stromal cells on tumor cells is thought to protect them from cytotoxic chemotherapy and is postulated as a possible explanation for the minimal residual disease in hematological and solid cancers. Therefore, CXCR4/CXCL12 signaling is an attractive therapeutic target in cancer, as proven in preclinical leukemia mouse models, where CXCR4 inhibition sensitized cancer cells to conventional chemotherapy. This study investigates whether inhibition of CXCR4 with the specific inhibitor AMD3100 sensitizes human prostate cancer cells to docetaxel. We showed that both mouse and human stromal cell lines have a protective effect on PC3-luc cells by promoting their survival after chemotherapy. Furthermore, we demonstrated that AMD3100 sensitizes PC3-luc cells to docetaxel. In a subcutaneous xenograft mouse model of human prostate carcinoma, we showed that a combination of docetaxel and AMD3100 exerts increased antitumor effect compared with docetaxel alone. We concluded that CXCR4 inhibition chemosensitizes prostate cancer cells, both in vitro and in vivo. To explore the relevance of these findings, we analyzed CXCR4 expression levels in human prostate cancer samples.

A secondary objective was to prospectively assess the additional costs of 3D versus 2D imaging with portal imaging for patient positioning controls.  Patients and methods:   Economics data are issued from a multicenter randomized medico-economics trial comparing the two frequencies of patient positioning control during prostate IGRT. A prospective cohort with patient positioning control with PI (control group) was constituted for the cost comparison between 3D (IGRT) versus 2D imaging. The economical evaluation was focused to the radiotherapy direct costs, adopting the hospital's point of view and using a microcosting method applied to the parameters that may lead to cost differences between evaluated strategies.  Results:   The economical analysis included a total of 241 patients enrolled between 2007 and 2011 in seven centres, 183 in the randomized study (128 with CBCT and 55 with fiducial markers) and 58 in the control group. Compared to weekly controls, the average additional cost per patient of daily controls was €847 (CBCT) and €179 (markers). Compared to PI, the average additional cost per patient was €1392 (CBCT) and €997 (fiducial markers) for daily controls; €545 (CBCT) and €818 (markers) in case of weekly controls.  Conclusion:   A daily frequency for image control in IGRT and 3D images patient positioning control (IGRT) for prostate cancer lead to significant additional cost compared to weekly control and 2D imaging (PI).

Material and methods:   From January 2010 to May 2011, 118 patients (median 62.5 years) with primary negative extended biopsy underwent a transperineal SPBx (median 30 cores) for persistent suspicion of PCa. The indications for repeated biopsy were: persistently high or increasing PSA values; PSA > 10 ng/mL, PSA values between 4.1-10 or 2.6-4 ng/mL with free/total PSA ≤ 25% and ≤ 20 %, respectively; moreover, before performing SPBx urinary PCA3 score was evaluated.  Results:   All patients had negative DRE and median PSA was 8.5 ng/mL (range: 3.7-24 ng/mL). A T1c PCa was found in 32 patients (27.1 %): PCA3 score was 59 (median; range: 7-201) in the presence of PCa and 35 (median; range: 3-253) in the absence of cancer (p < 0.05). In the presence of ASAP and HGPIN median PCA3 score was 109 (range: 42-253) and 40 (range: 30-140), respectively. Diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of PCA3 score cut-off of 20 vs 35 in PCa diagnosis were 44.9 vs 50 %, 90.6 vs 71.9 %, 27.9 vs 41.8 %, 31.9 vs 31.5 % and 88.9 vs 80 %, respectively. ROC analysis demonstrated an AUC for PCA3 ≥ 20 vs ≥ 35 of 0.678 and 0.634, respectively.  Conclusions:   Our data suggest that PCA3 is more useful as an exclusion tool; moreover, setting a PCA3 cut-off at 20 vs 35, would have avoided 22.9 vs 38.1 % of biopsies while missing 9.4 % and 28 % diagnosis of PCa.""","""['Pietro Pepe', 'Filippo Fraggetta', 'Antonio Galia', 'Giorgio Skonieczny', 'Francesco Aragona']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Int Braz J Urol""","""['PCA3 score accuracy in diagnosing prostate cancer at repeat biopsy: our experience in 177 patients.', 'PCA3 score vs PSA free/total accuracy in prostate cancer diagnosis at repeat saturation biopsy.', 'Prostate cancer detection rate at repeat saturation biopsy: PCPT risk calculator versus PCA3 score versus case-finding protocol.', 'Urinary Prostate Cancer Antigen 3 as a Tumour Marker: Biochemical and Clinical Aspects.', 'Blood-based and urinary prostate cancer biomarkers: a review and comparison of novel biomarkers for detection and treatment decisions.', 'Ubiquitin-related lncRNAs: The new tool for prognosis prediction in prostate cancer.', 'A Combined CRISP3 and SPINK1 Prognostic Grade in EPS-Urine and Establishment of Models to Predict Prognosis of Patients With Prostate Cancer.', 'Electrochemical and optical detection and machine learning applied to images of genosensors for diagnosis of prostate cancer with the biomarker PCA3.', 'How is the association between urinary prostate cancer antigen 3 (PCA3) levels and Gleason scores in patients suspicious of prostate cancer?', 'Diagnosis accuracy of PCA3 level in patients with prostate cancer: a systematic review with meta-analysis.']"""

Oncogenic activation of the ERG is the most common early genomic alteration in patients with prostate cancer (CaP) in Western countries. However, ERG alterations have not been systematically examined in African American patients with a known greater risk of CaP incidence and mortality.  Methods:   ERG oncoprotein expression was analyzed in 91 Caucasian and 91 African American patients with CaP, who were matched for age, Gleason score, and pathologic stage. A unique aspect of the present study was the evaluation of ERG in whole-mount prostatectomy sections, minimizing sampling bias and allowing the careful assessment of the ERG in the multifocal tumor context of CaP.  Results:   The frequency of ERG-positive prostate tumors was significantly greater among Caucasian Americans than among African Americans when assessed in all tumor foci (41.9% vs 23.9%, P < .0001). A markedly greater frequency of ERG oncoprotein expression was noted between the index tumors of the Caucasian Americans (63.3%) and those of the African Americans (28.6%). Also, in the African American patients, the higher grade index tumors were predominantly ERG negative.  Conclusion:   ERG typing of CaP established a major difference between the index tumors of Caucasian and African American patients. ERG-negative index tumors might indicate a less favorable outcome for African American patients. The results of the present study underscore that typing of CaP for the ERG could enhance our understanding of the biologic differences between the examined ethnic groups.""","""['Philip Rosen', 'David Pfister', 'Denise Young', 'Gyorgy Petrovics', 'Yongmei Chen', 'Jennifer Cullen', 'Diana Böhm', 'Sven Perner', 'Albert Dobi', 'David G McLeod', 'Isabell A Sesterhenn', 'Shiv Srivastava']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Urology""","""['Predicting Prostate Cancer Progression as a Function of ETS-related Gene Status, Race, and Obesity in a Longitudinal Patient Cohort.', 'Evidence for molecular differences in prostate cancer between African American and Caucasian men.', 'Increased association of the ERG oncoprotein expression in advanced stages of prostate cancer in Filipinos.', 'Genetic and molecular differences in prostate carcinogenesis between African American and Caucasian American men.', 'The prognostic and predictive value of TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion and ERG protein expression in prostate cancer biopsies.', 'Race and prostate cancer: genomic landscape.', 'ETS factors in prostate cancer.', 'Insufficient Lycopene Intake Is Associated With High Risk of Prostate Cancer: A Cross-Sectional Study From the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2003-2010).', 'Deciphering the Polygenic Basis of Racial Disparities in Prostate Cancer By an Integrative Analysis of Genomic and Transcriptomic Data.', 'Genetic Contributions to Prostate Cancer Disparities in Men of West African Descent.']"""

Results:   Lymph nodes within periprostatic fat pads were detected in 19 (5.5%) patients. Among these patients, tumor infiltration was found in 4 (1.2%). Three of these 4 patients harbored lymph node metastases without any other lymph node metastasis during standard lymphadenectomy.

Our prior work reveals that treatment with zinc-chelating agents induces selective downregulation of the X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein in cancer cells of various origins. A precursor of the heme synthetic pathway, 5-aminolevulinic acid, is metabolized to protoporphyrin IX, which is highly reactive with zinc. We assessed whether modified versions of 5-aminolevulinic acid with lipophilic side chains can enhance efficacy and selectivity with respect to protoporphyrin IX accumulation, X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein depletion, and tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand-mediated apoptosis in human castration-resistant prostate cancer cells.  Methods:   Seven modified versions of 5-aminolevulinic acid (5 esters and 2 amides) were synthesized. Levels of endogenous protoporphyrin IX were examined by flow cytometry. X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein expression was examined by Western blotting. terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling assay was used to assess cell apoptosis. Results were compared qualitatively.  Results:   Accumulation of endogenous protoporphyrin IX by castration-resistant prostate cancer cells was shown to be directly related to the carbon chain length of the esterified 5-aminolevulinic acid derivatives. In fact, treatment with 5-aminolevulinic acid-HE was superior to that achieved by 5-aminolevulinic acid with respect to X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein downregulation. 5-aminolevulinic acid and 5-aminolevulinic acid-HE in combination with tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand significantly enhanced apoptotic cell death in castration-resistant prostate cancer cell lines.  Conclusion:   Esterified derivatives of 5-aminolevulinic acid alone or in combination with other agents may provide therapeutic opportunities in the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer by harnessing apoptotic pathways that are triggered by cellular zinc imbalance.""","""['Ervin Teper', 'Peter Makhov', 'Konstantin Golovine', 'Daniel J Canter', 'Cynthia B Myers', 'Alexander Kutikov', 'Steven N Sterious', 'Robert G Uzzo', 'Vladimir M Kolenko']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Urology""","""['The inhibition of ferrochelatase enhances 5-aminolevulinic acid-based photodynamic action for prostate cancer.', 'Targeting of sebocytes by aminolevulinic acid-dependent photosensitization.', 'Potential Molecular Mechanisms Involved in 5-Aminolevulinic Acid-Based Photodynamic Therapy against Human Hypertrophic Scars.', 'Selective 5-aminolevulinic acid-induced protoporphyrin IX fluorescence in Gliomas.', '5-Aminolevulinic acid regulates the inflammatory response and alloimmune reaction.', 'Antitumor Effects of 5-Aminolevulinic Acid on Human Malignant Glioblastoma Cells.', 'Non-NAD-Like poly(ADP-Ribose) Polymerase-1 Inhibitors effectively Eliminate Cancer in vivo.', 'Minor grove binding ligands disrupt PARP-1 activation pathways.']"""

The functional expression of peptide transporters is also identified in other types of tissues, such as glia cells, macrophages, and the epithelia of the bile duct, the lungs, and the mammary glands. However, their presence and role are poorly understood in carcinomas. We explored the expression profile and functional activity of peptide transporters in the prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP, PC-3, and DU145. Quantitative real time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western blot were used to evaluate the expression profile of peptide transporter 1 (PEPT1), peptide transporter 2 (PEPT2), peptide histidine transporter 1 (PHT1), and peptide histidine transporter 2 (PHT2) in these cells. LNCaP expresses high levels of PEPT2 and PHT1, while PC-3 demonstrates strong expression of PEPT1 and PHT1. DU145 shows only weak expression of PEPT1 and PHT1. Functional activities were studied in these cell lines using radiolabeled glycylsarcosine ([(3)H]Gly-Sar) and l-histidine ([(3)H]-l-histidine). The uptake of [(3)H]Gly-Sar and [(3)H]-l-histidine was time- and pH-dependent. A kinetic study showed that the uptake of Gly-Sar and l-histidine is saturable over the tested concentration range. The binding affinity (K(m)) and the maximal velocity (V(max)) exhibited in the three cell lines were consistent with the expression profiles we observed in qRT-PCR and Western blot analysis. A competitive inhibition study revealed that peptide transporters in prostate cancer cells exhibited broad substrate specificity with a preference for hydrophobic dipeptides, such as Leu-Leu. Fluorescence microscopy study revealed that the fluorescent dipeptide probe d-Ala-Lys-AMCA (a substrate of peptide transporters) specifically accumulated in the cytoplasm of LNCaP and PC-3, but not DU145 cells. Inhibiting the peptide transporter activity by Gly-Sar suppressed the growth of LNCaP and PC-3 cells. Our study indicated that PC-3 cells can be established as a new cell culture model for PEPT1 study, and LNCaP can be used as a model for PEPT2 study. Moreover, our results suggested that peptide transporters are overexpressed in prostate cancer cells and can be adopted as a promising target for tumor-specific drug delivery.""","""['Wanyi Tai', 'Zhijin Chen', 'Kun Cheng']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Mol Pharm""","""['Functional characterization of brain peptide transporter in rat cerebral cortex: identification of the high-affinity type H+/peptide transporter PEPT2.', 'Divergent developmental expression and function of the proton-coupled oligopeptide transporters PepT2 and PhT1 in regional brain slices of mouse and rat.', 'The proton-coupled oligopeptide transporters PEPT2, PHT1 and PHT2 mediate the uptake of carnosine in glioblastoma cells.', 'Physiological and pharmacological implications of peptide transporters, PEPT1 and PEPT2.', 'Peptide transporters: structure, function, regulation and application for drug delivery.', 'The Role of Solute Carrier Transporters in Efficient Anticancer Drug Delivery and Therapy.', 'Transport of Biologically Active Ultrashort Peptides Using POT and LAT Carriers.', 'PEPT1 is essential for the growth of pancreatic cancer cells: a viable drug target.', 'SLC15A4 Serves as a Novel Prognostic Biomarker and Target for Lung Adenocarcinoma.', '5-Aminolevulinic acid for fluorescence-guided surgery in pancreatic cancer: Cellular transport and fluorescence quantification studies.']"""

In the light of recent studies purporting difference in prognostic outcomes for the subgroups of GS7 group (primary Gleason pattern 4 vs. 3), upgrading of a bGS of 6 to a GS≥7 has serious implications. We sought to identify pre-operative factors associated with upgrading in a cohort of GS6 patients who underwent prostatectomy.  Design:   We identified 281 cases of GS6 PCA on biopsy with subsequent prostatectomies. Using data on pre-operative variables (age, PSA, biopsy pathology parameters), logistic regression models (LRM) were developed to identify factors that could be used to predict upgrading to GS≥7 on subsequent prostatectomy. A decision tree (DT) was constructed.  Results:   92 of 281 cases (32.7%) were upgraded on subsequent prostatectomy. LRM identified a model with two variables with statistically significant ability to predict upgrading, including pre-biopsy PSA (Odds Ratio 8.66; 2.03-37.49, 95% CI) and highest percentage of cancer at any single biopsy site (Odds Ratio 1.03, 1.01-1.05, 95% CI). This two-parameter model yielded an area under curve of 0.67. The decision tree was constructed using only 3 leave nodes; with a test set classification accuracy of 70%.  Conclusions:   A simplistic model using clinical and biopsy data is able to predict the likelihood of upgrading of GS with an acceptable level of certainty.

Significant improvement in ovarian cancer survival will require the development of more effective molecularly targeted therapeutics. Commonly, mouse models are used for the in vivo assessment of potential new therapeutic targets in ovarian cancer. However, animal models are costly and time consuming. Other models, such as the chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay, are therefore an attractive alternative. CAM assays have been widely used to study angiogenesis and tumor invasion of colorectal, prostate and brain cancers. However, there have been limited studies that have used CAM assays to assess ovarian cancer invasion and metastasis. We have therefore developed a CAM assay protocol to monitor the metastatic properties of ovarian cancer cells (OVCAR-3, SKOV-3 and OV-90) and to study the effect of potential therapeutic molecules in vivo. The results from the CAM assay are consistent with cancer cell motility and invasion observed in in vitro assays. Our results demonstrate that the CAM assay is a robust and cost effective model to study ovarian cancer cell metastasis.

Correspondingly, the inhibitory effect of p63 on EMT markers and cell migration is reverted by anti-miR-205. p53 mutants inhibit expression of both p63 and miR-205, and the cell migration, in a cell line expressing endogenous mutated p53, can be abrogated by pre-miR-205 or silencing of mutated p53. In accordance with this in vitro data, ΔNp63 or miR-205 significantly inhibits the incidence of lung metastasis in vivo in a mouse tail vein model. Similarly, one or both components of the p63/miR-205 axis were absent in metastases or colonized lymph nodes in a set of 218 human prostate cancer samples. This was confirmed in an independent clinical data set of 281 patients. Loss of this axis was associated with higher Gleason scores, an increased likelihood of metastatic and infiltration events, and worse prognosis. These data suggest that p63/miR-205 may be a useful clinical predictor of metastatic behavior in prostate cancer.""","""['Paola Tucci', 'Massimiliano Agostini', 'Francesca Grespi', 'Elke K Markert', 'Alessandro Terrinoni', 'Karen H Vousden', 'Patricia A J Muller', 'Volker Dötsch', 'Sebastian Kehrloesser', 'Berna S Sayan', 'Giuseppe Giaccone', 'Scott W Lowe', 'Nozomi Takahashi', 'Peter Vandenabeele', 'Richard A Knight', 'Arnold J Levine', 'Gerry Melino']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A""","""['Synergetic Effects of Intronic Mature miR-944 and ΔNp63 Isoforms on Tumorigenesis in a Cervical Cancer Cell Line.', 'miR-199b-5p-DDR1-ERK signalling axis suppresses prostate cancer metastasis via inhibiting epithelial-mesenchymal transition.', 'MiR-301a regulates E-cadherin expression and is predictive of prostate cancer recurrence.', 'The guardians of the genome (p53, TA-p73, and TA-p63) are regulators of tumor suppressor miRNAs network.', 'A double dealing tale of p63: an oncogene or a tumor suppressor.', 'Investigating microRNA Profiles in Prostate Cancer Bone Metastases and Functional Effects of microRNA-23c and microRNA-4328.', 'ZNF750: A Novel Prognostic Biomarker in Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Oncogenic YAP mediates changes in chromatin accessibility and activity that drive cell cycle gene expression and cell migration.', 'Molecular Mechanisms of Noncoding RNA in the Occurrence of Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'The p53 Family Members p63 and p73 Roles in the Metastatic Dissemination: Interactions with microRNAs and TGFβ Pathway.']"""

Aims:   To examine cancer incidence among a cohort of UK electricity generation and transmission workers.  Methods:   Cancer morbidity experienced by a cohort of 81 842 employees of the former Central Electricity Generating Board of England and Wales was investigated for the period 1973-2008. All employees had worked for at least 6 months with some employment between 1973 and 1982. Standardized registration ratios (SRRs) were calculated on the basis of national rates.  Results:   Overall cancer morbidity was slightly below expectation in males and females. Significant excesses were found in male workers for mesothelioma (Observed [Obs] 504, SRR 331), skin cancer (non-melanoma) (Obs 3187, SRR 107) and prostate cancer (Obs 2684, SRR 107) and in female workers for cancer of the small intestine (Obs 10, SRR 306) and nasal cancer (Obs 9, SRR 474). Brain cancers were close to expectation in males and below expectation in females. Leukaemia incidence (all types) was slightly below expectation in males and females. More detailed analyses showed import ant contrasts for mesothelioma and leukaemia.  Conclusions:   The clear occupational excess of mesothelioma was not matched by a corresponding excess of lung cancer, and the level of asbestos-induced lung cancer in this industry must be low. Leukaemia risks declined with period from hire; confident interpretation of this finding is not possible. The excesses of cancers of the nasal cavities and small intestine are probably not occupational, though the excess of skin cancer may be due to outdoor work.""","""['T Sorahan']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Occup Med (Lond)""","""['Cancer incidence in UK electricity generation and transmission workers, 1973-2015.', 'Mortality of UK electricity generation and transmission workers, 1973-2002.', 'Cancer incidence and cancer mortality in a cohort of UK semiconductor workers, 1970-2002.', 'A critical review of cancer epidemiology in the petroleum industry, with a meta-analysis of a combined database of more than 350,000 workers.', 'Meta-analysis of occupational exposures in the rubber manufacturing industry and risk of cancer.', 'Cancer incidence in UK electricity generation and transmission workers, 1973-2015.']"""

To identify genes that encode secreted proteins present in prostate cancer (PCa), we generated Escherichia coli ampicillin secretion trap (CAST) libraries from PCa and normal prostate (NP).  Methods and results:   We identified 15 candidate genes that encode secreted proteins present in PCa and NP. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed that MSMB, NBL1 and AZGP1 were expressed with much higher specificity in PCa and NP than in 14 other kinds of normal tissue. We focused on NBL1, which was originally identified as a putative tumor suppressor gene. Western blot analysis revealed that NBL1 protein was highly expressed in both cell lysate and culture media of the DU145 PCa cell line. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that NBL1 expression was highly detected in and restricted to NP and PCa and was significantly down-regulated in PCa. NBL1 expression was significantly reduced according to the tumor stage, Gleason grade and preoperative prostate-specific antigen (PSA) value.

The marked increase in life expectancy in recent years calls for reconsideration of the decision-making process for the treatment of prostate cancer, a condition particularly affecting the elderly. To date the general approach in elderly patients has tended to be more conservative, not least as it is generally thought that prostate cancer in these patients is less biologically aggressive. The present data showed that patients aged ≥70 years had biologically more aggressive tumours significantly more often than those aged <70 years. Nevertheless, advanced age itself was not an independent predictor of survival after retropubic radical prostatectomy, whereas adverse prostate cancer features and severe comorbidities were.  Objective:   To investigate the effect of advanced age (≥70 years) on prostate cancer characteristics, oncological and functional outcomes in patients undergoing retropubic radical prostatectomy (RP).  Patients and methods:   Between June 1997 and September 2009, 1636 patients underwent RP at one institution. Of these patients, 1225 were aged < 70 years and 411 ≥70 years. Both groups were compared for prostate cancer characteristics, oncological and functional outcomes. Multivariate analyses were used to estimate the effect of advanced age on overall survival (OS), cancer-specific survival (CSS), biochemical recurrence-free survival (BFS) and postoperative continence.  Results:   The median (range) age of the patients aged ≥ 70 years was 72 (70-85) years and for those aged < 70 years was 64 (40-69) years (P < 0.001), respectively. The patients aged ≥ 70 years were assigned higher American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classes (P < 0.001) reflecting a higher rate of severe comorbidities in this group. In the patients aged ≥ 70 years there were significantly more clinically palpable and pathologically non-organ-confined tumours (P= 0.030 and P= 0.026, respectively), and higher biopsy and RP Gleason scores (P= 0.002 and P= 0.004, respectively). Accordingly, patients aged ≥ 70 years presented with a higher proportion of high-risk prostate cancer, although the difference was not significant (P= 0.060). There were no differences between the groups for preoperative prostate-specific antigen level (P= 0.898), rate of pelvic lymph node dissection (P= 0.231), pN+ (P= 0.526) and R+ status (P= 0.590). Kaplan-Meier curves showed a significantly lower 10-year OS (67 vs 82%; P= 0.017) and a trend towards a lower 10-year CSS (70 vs 83%; P= 0.057) in patients aged ≥ 70 years. However, on multivariate analysis advanced age was not an independent predictor of OS (P= 0.102) or CSS (P= 0.195), whereas pN+ status (both P < 0.001), RP Gleason scores 8-10 (both P < 0.001) and ASA classes 3-4 (P= 0.037 and P= 0.028, respectively) were. The 2-year postoperative continence rates was comparable between the groups (International Continence Society [ICS] male incontinence symptom score 2.10 vs 2.01; P= 0.984). In multivariate analysis it depended only on the preoperative ICSmale incontinence symptom score (P < 0.001) but not on advanced age (P= 0.341).  Conclusions:   Patients aged ≥ 70 years had biologically more aggressive and locally advanced tumours significantly more often than those aged < 70 years. However, advanced age itself was not an independent predictor of survival after RP. Rather, survival was associated with adverse prostate cancer features and severe comorbidities. Consequently, it seems unjustifiable to generally exclude elderly patients from RP, not least because surgery achieved excellent postoperative continence in this age group, too.""","""['Inga Kunz', 'Michael Musch', 'Ulla Roggenbuck', 'Virgilijus Klevecka', 'Darko Kroepfl']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Re: Tumour characteristics, oncological and functional outcomes in patients aged ≥ 70 years undergoing radical prostatectomy.', 'Radical prostatectomy represents an effective treatment in patients with specimen-confined high pathological Gleason score prostate cancer.', 'Radical prostatectomy improves progression-free and cancer-specific survival in men with lymph node positive prostate cancer in the prostate-specific antigen era: a confirmatory study.', 'Long-term oncological and continence outcomes after laparoscopic radical prostatectomy: a single-centre experience.', 'No difference in six-year biochemical failure rates with or without pelvic lymph node dissection during radical prostatectomy in low-risk patients with localized prostate cancer.', 'Long-term oncological outcomes after laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.', 'Mechanisms of decision-making in preoperative assessment for older adult prostate cancer patients-A qualitative study.', 'Contemporary trends in radical prostatectomy and predictors of recovery of urinary continence in men aged over 70 years: comparisons between cohorts aged over 70 and less than 70 years.', 'Recovery of pad-free continence in elderly men does not differ from younger men undergoing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy for aggressive prostate cancer.', 'Trends in Treatment for Prostate Cancer in China: Preliminary Patterns of Care Study in a Single Institution.', 'Outcome of Robotic Radical Prostatectomy in Men Over 74.']"""

Methods:   Five Waikato general practices investigated looking at PSA laboratory tests of men ≥40 years in 2010 compared against GP notes. Testing rates, reasons for testing, histology and referral/s were examined for different age groups. A questionnaire was sent to the GPs to determine their views on PSA testing.  Results:   One in four men aged 40+ years had a PSA test in 2010. Of these men, 71% were asymptomatic. More than half of men tested aged 70+ years were asymptomatic. Ten percent of all PSA tests were elevated. Twenty-one of 23 prostate cancers were diagnosed following an elevated PSA test: more than 80% of these men had histories of prostate pathology or lower urinary tract symptoms. The questionnaire confirmed that GPs believe in the benefits of PSA screening and it also showed they had difficulty in providing patients with information about pros and cons of PSA testing.  Discussion:   All GPs in this study tested asymptomatic men. GPs in this study value PSA screening and believe that it reduces mortality rates.

In this study, we exploited 2DE-based proteomics to compare nine pairs of the proteome maps collected from untreated and treated DU145 cells to identify the differentially expressed proteins. Comparative proteomics indicated that 11 proteins were deregulated in affected DU145 cells with three upregulated and eight downregulated proteins. These dys-regulated proteins participated in cytoskeletal functions, antiapoptosis, proteasome activity, NF-κB signaling, cancer cell proliferation, invasion, and angiogenesis. Western immunoblotting were implemented to confirm the deregulated proteins and the downstream signaling proteins. The analytical results of this study help to provide insight into the molecular mechanism of inducing prostate cancer cell apoptosis by pomegranate fruit juice and to develop a novel mechanism-based chemopreventive strategy for prostate cancer.""","""['Song-Tay Lee', 'Yi-Ling Wu', 'Lan-Hsiang Chien', 'Szu-Ting Chen', 'Yu-Kai Tzeng', 'Ting-Feng Wu']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Proteomics""","""['Clarification of the molecular pathway of Taiwan local pomegranate fruit juice underlying the inhibition of urinary bladder urothelial carcinoma cell by proteomics strategy.', 'Ellagic acid, a component of pomegranate fruit juice, suppresses androgen-dependent prostate carcinogenesis via induction of apoptosis.', 'Pomegranate fruit juice for chemoprevention and chemotherapy of prostate cancer.', 'Ellagic acid, pomegranate and prostate cancer -- a mini review.', 'Punica granatum (pomegranate) and its potential for prevention and treatment of inflammation and cancer.', 'Pomegranate-specific natural compounds as onco-preventive and onco-therapeutic compounds: Comparison with conventional drugs acting on the same molecular mechanisms.', 'The Therapeutic Alliance between Pomegranate and Health Emphasizing on Anticancer Properties.', 'Uncovering the Inhibitory Molecular Mechanism of Pomegranate Peel to Urinary Bladder Urothelial Carcinoma Using Proteomics Techniques.', 'Deciphering the Molecular Mechanism Underlying the Inhibitory Efficacy of Taiwanese Local Pomegranate Peels against Urinary Bladder Urothelial Carcinoma.', 'Pomegranate for Prevention and Treatment of Cancer: An Update.']"""

Recently, ¹³C MRS-detectable hyperpolarized pyruvate to lactate conversion has been validated in models as a noninvasive imaging method for the detection of tumors and treatment response, and has successfully passed phase I clinical trials. To date, response to treatment has been associated with a decrease in hyperpolarized lactate production. In this study, we monitored the effect of treatment with the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK) inhibitor U0126 in prostate and breast cancer cells. Following treatment, we observed a 31% decrease in the flux of hyperpolarized ¹³C label in treated MCF-7 breast cancer cells relative to controls. In contrast, and unexpectedly, the flux increased to 167% in treated PC3 prostate cancer cells. To mechanistically explain these observations, we investigated treatment-induced changes in the different factors known to affect the pyruvate to lactate conversion. NADH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, reduced form) levels remained unchanged, whereas lactate dehydrogenase expression and activity, as well as intracellular lactate, increased in both cell lines, providing an explanation for the elevated hyperpolarized lactate observed in PC3 cells. The expression of MCT1, which mediates pyruvate transport, decreased in treated MCF-7, but not PC3, cells. This identifies pyruvate transport as rate limiting in U0126-treated MCF-7 cells and explains the decrease in hyperpolarized lactate observed in these cells following treatment. Our findings highlight the complexity of interactions between MEK and metabolism, and the need for mechanistic validation before hyperpolarized ¹³C MRS can be used to monitor treatment-induced molecular responses.""","""['Alessia Lodi', 'Sarah M Woods', 'Sabrina M Ronen']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""NMR Biomed""","""['MR-detectable metabolic consequences of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibition.', 'Hyperpolarized 1-13Cpyruvate-to-1-13Clactate conversion is rate-limited by monocarboxylate transporter-1 in the plasma membrane.', 'HDAC inhibition in glioblastoma monitored by hyperpolarized 13 C MRSI.', 'Hyperpolarized 1-13C-Pyruvate Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic Imaging of Prostate Cancer In Vivo Predicts Efficacy of Targeting the Warburg Effect.', 'Hyperpolarized (13)C MR imaging detects no lactate production in mutant IDH1 gliomas: Implications for diagnosis and response monitoring.', 'MicroRNA-Based Discovery of Biomarkers, Therapeutic Targets, and Repositioning Drugs for Breast Cancer.', 'Hyperpolarized Carbon-13 MRI in Breast Cancer.', 'Conversion of Hyperpolarized 1-13CPyruvate in Breast Cancer Cells Depends on Their Malignancy, Metabolic Program and Nutrient Microenvironment.', 'Hyperpolarized Carbon-13 MRI for Early Response Assessment of Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy in Breast Cancer Patients.', 'Offset of apparent hyperpolarized 13 C lactate flux by the use of adjuvant metformin in ionizing radiation therapy in vivo.']"""

To gain new insights into the roles of V-ATPases in prostate cancer (PCa), we studied the effects of inhibiting V-ATPase pumps in androgen-dependent (LNCaP) and androgen-independent (C4-2B) cells of a human PCa progression model. Treatment with nanomolar concentrations of the V-ATPase inhibitors bafilomycin A or concanamycin A reduced the in vitro invasion in both cell types by 80%, regardless that V-ATPase was prominent at the plasma membrane of C4-2B cells and only traces were detected in the low-metastatic LNCaP parental cells. In both cell types, intracellular V-ATPase was excessive and co-localized with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in the Golgi compartment. V-ATPase inhibitors reversibly excluded PSA from the Golgi and led to the accumulation of largely dispersed PSA-loaded vesicles of lysosomal composition. Inhibition of acridine orange staining and transferrin receptor recycling suggested defective endosomal and lysosomal acidification. The inhibitors, additionally, interfered with the AR-PSA axis under conditions that reduced invasion. Bafilomycin A significantly reduced steady-state and R1881-induced PSA mRNA expression and secretion in the LNCaP cells which are androgen-dependent, but not in the C4-2B cells which are androgen ablation-resistant. In the C4-2B cells, an increased susceptibility to V-ATPase inhibitors was detected after longer treatments, as proliferation was reduced and reversibility of bafilomycin-induced responses impaired.

Amongst 465 mammalian glycan structures on the chip, more than 20 different sulphated glycans were detected as the preferred binding partners of the peptide NK-2. The amount of peptide bound to sialic acid containing oligosaccharides was close to background level. These findings were consistent with microcalorimetric experiments revealing high and low binding enthalpies of peptides to sulphated carbohydrates and to sialic acid, respectively. Enzymatic desialylation of PC-3 cells did not affect peptide-mediated changes in cell metabolism, cell membrane permeabilisation, killing rate, and kinetics.

However, the clinical significance of its expression in human prostate cancer (PCa) has not been determined. We aimed to identify the potential role of cortactin expression in tumour progression and prognosis in PCa and the association with HDACs.  Methods:   256 foci with distinctive lesions in 110 prostate specimens were collected to identify the status of among cortactin, SIRT2, histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) by immunohistochemistry and its relationship with clinicopathological and follow-up data were analysed.  Results:   The results showed that cortactin expression was significantly higher (79.1%), and SIRT2 expression was lower (37.3%) in PCa foci, when it was compared with high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia foci and benign foci, respectively. HDAC6 expression was low and had no statistical significance in PCa. High intensity of cortactin staining was significantly and independently associated with a high prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, high Gleason score, clinical stage progression and shortened survival time in patients with PCa. High intensity of SIRT2 staining was significantly and independently associated with a high PSA level, old age, high Gleason score and clinical stage progression. Multivariable Cox regression analysis showed cortactin expression was a significant prognostic factor for survival of patients with PCa (β, 0.736; 95% CI 1.371 to 3.181; p=0.001).

The aim of the present study was to examine current practice for referral and diagnosis of prostate cancer patients with spinal cord compression and to identify prognostic factors for neurological outcome after surgery.  Patients and methods:   The study includes 68 consecutive patients with prostate cancer who underwent surgery due to neurological compromise. Intervals from onset of neurological symptoms to referral, diagnosis, and treatment were analyzed in relation to functional outcome. The prognostic significance of preoperative clinical parameters on gait function one month after surgery was evaluated.  Results:   Patients who were referred from local hospitals had longer delay to surgery than those who directly presented to the cancer center (p = 0.004). The rate of diagnosis with MRI increased through the week and peaked on Friday, with few patients being diagnosed during weekends. The ability to walk before surgery, hormone-naive prostate cancer, and/or shorter time from loss of ambulation were associated with more favorable neurological outcome. In patients with hormone-refractory disease who were unable to walk before surgery regaining ambulation was associated with: duration of paresis < 48 hours (p = 0.005), good preoperative performance status (p = 0.04), preoperative PSA serum level < 200 ng/ml (p = 0.03), and surgery with posterior decompression and stabilization (p = 0.03).  Conclusion:   Early diagnosis and rapid treatment of spinal cord compression in prostate cancer patients is crucial for neurological recovery. Raising awareness of the condition among patients at risk and among physicians is of outmost importance as well as improving local and regional guidelines for treatment.""","""['Sead Crnalic', 'Christer Hildingsson', 'Anders Bergh', 'Anders Widmark', 'Olle Svensson', 'Richard Löfvenberg']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Acta Oncol""","""['Predicting survival for surgery of metastatic spinal cord compression in prostate cancer: a new score.', 'Factors associated with improved outcomes following decompressive surgery for prostate cancer metastatic to the spine.', 'Predictors of ambulatory function after decompressive surgery for metastatic epidural spinal cord compression.', 'Spinal cord compression--an oncologic emergency.', 'Decompression surgery for spinal metastases: a systematic review.', 'Systemic considerations for the surgical treatment of spinal metastatic disease: a scoping literature review.', 'Effect of the Timing of Surgery on Neurological Recovery for Patients with Incomplete Paraplegia Caused by Metastatic Spinal Cord Compression.', 'Current Advances in Spinal Diseases of the Elderly: Introduction to the Special Issue.', 'Evaluating ambulatory function as an outcome following treatment for spinal metastases: a systematic review.', 'Neurological outcome of treatment for patients with impending paralysis due to epidural spinal cord compression by metastatic spinal tumor.']"""

Methods:   From April 2010 to January 2011, 61 patients with biopsy-proven prostate cancer underwent preoperative transrectal gray-scale (b-mode) ultrasound and SE of the prostate. Cancer-suspicious areas were documented for b-mode and SE, dividing the prostate into six topographic sectors. Suspicious areas in both modalities were compared to tumour localisation in the prostatectomy specimen. Sensitivity, specificity, positive- and negative predictive values were calculated for both investigation techniques.  Results:   Prostate cancer was present in 232 of 366 pathological sectors (62 %). B-mode ultrasound showed 113 suspicious sectors, while SE indicated prostate cancer in 157 areas. The precise localisation of at least one pathologically confirmed cancerous lesion was possible in 42/61 (69 %) patients by b-mode ultrasound and 56/61 (92 %) patients by SE (P<0.005). The sensitivity for b-mode ultrasound was 33 % and specificity 74 %. For SE sensitivity was 53 %, while specificity was 74 %.

Here we have introduced MGAT1 shRNA into human HeLa cervical and PC-3-Yellow prostate tumor cells lines, generating cell lines with reduced transcript, enzyme activity and branched N-glycans at the cell surface. MGAT1 knockdown inhibited HeLa cell migration and invasion, but did not alter cell proliferation rates. Swainsonine, an inhibitor of α-mannosidase II immediately downstream of MGAT1, also inhibited cell invasion and was not additive with MGAT1 shRNA, consistent with a common mechanism of action. Focal adhesion and microfilament organization in MGAT1 knockdown cells also indicate a less motile phenotype.

Since two-dimensional (2D) cultures lack the essential characteristics of the native cellular microenvironment, three-dimensional (3D) cultures have been developed to better mimic the natural extracellular matrix. To date, 3D culture systems have relied mostly on collagen and Matrigel™ hydrogels, allowing only limited control over matrix stiffness, proteolytic degradability, and ligand density. In contrast, bioengineered hydrogels allow us to independently tune and systematically investigate the influence of these parameters on cell growth and differentiation. In this study, polyethylene glycol (PEG) hydrogels, functionalized with the Arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) motifs, common cell-binding motifs in extracellular matrix proteins, and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) cleavage sites, were characterized regarding their stiffness, diffusive properties, and ability to support growth of androgen-dependent LNCaP prostate cancer cells. We found that the mechanical properties modulated the growth kinetics of LNCaP cells in the PEG hydrogel. At culture periods of 28 days, LNCaP cells underwent morphogenic changes, forming tumor-like structures in 3D culture, with hypoxic and apoptotic cores. We further compared protein and gene expression levels between 3D and 2D cultures upon stimulation with the synthetic androgen R1881. Interestingly, the kinetics of R1881 stimulated androgen receptor (AR) nuclear translocation differed between 2D and 3D cultures when observed by immunofluorescent staining. Furthermore, microarray studies revealed that changes in expression levels of androgen responsive genes upon R1881 treatment differed greatly between 2D and 3D cultures. Taken together, culturing LNCaP cells in the tunable PEG hydrogels reveals differences in the cellular responses to androgen stimulation between the 2D and 3D environments. Therefore, we suggest that the presented 3D culture system represents a powerful tool for high throughput prostate cancer drug testing that recapitulates tumor microenvironment.""","""['Shirly Sieh', 'Anna V Taubenberger', 'Simone C Rizzi', 'Martin Sadowski', 'Melanie L Lehman', 'Anja Rockstroh', 'Jiyuan An', 'Judith A Clements', 'Colleen C Nelson', 'Dietmar W Hutmacher']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['3D extracellular matrix interactions modulate tumour cell growth, invasion and angiogenesis in engineered tumour microenvironments.', 'Bioengineered 3D brain tumor model to elucidate the effects of matrix stiffness on glioblastoma cell behavior using PEG-based hydrogels.', 'Distinct phenotypes of cancer cells on tissue matrix gel.', 'Synthetic hydrogels mimicking basement membrane matrices to promote cell-matrix interactions.', 'Hydrogels for in vivo-like three-dimensional cellular studies.', 'Prostate cancer cells of increasing metastatic potential exhibit diverse contractile forces, cell stiffness, and motility in a microenvironment stiffness-dependent manner.', 'Three-dimensional in vitro culture models in oncology research.', '3D In Vitro Models for Investigating the Role of Stiffness in Cancer Invasion.', 'The Role of Biomimetic Hypoxia on Cancer Cell Behaviour in 3D Models: A Systematic Review.', 'Peptide-protein coassembling matrices as a biomimetic 3D model of ovarian cancer.']"""

The individual income-related insurance payment amount was used as a proxy measure of individual SES for patients. Neighborhood SES was defined by income, and neighborhoods were grouped as living in advantaged or disadvantaged areas. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to compare the death-free survival rates between the different SES groups after adjusting for possible confounding and risk factors.  Results:   After adjusting for patient characteristics (age, gender, Charlson Comorbidity Index Score, urbanization, and area of residence), tumor extent, treatment modalities (operation and adjuvant therapy), and hospital characteristics (ownership and teaching level), colorectal cancer, and head and neck cancer patients under 65 years old with low individual SES in disadvantaged neighborhoods conferred a 1.5 to 2-fold higher risk of mortality, compared with patients with high individual SES in advantaged neighborhoods. A cross-level interaction effect was found in lung cancer and breast cancer. Lung cancer and breast cancer patients less than 65 years old with low SES in advantaged neighborhoods carried the highest risk of mortality. Prostate cancer patients aged 65 and above with low SES in disadvantaged neighborhoods incurred the highest risk of mortality. There was no association between SES and mortality for cervical cancer and pancreatic cancer.

We find that advanced prostate cancer patients who clinically respond to treatment also develop enhanced Ab responses to a higher number of Ags than nonresponders. These induced Ab responses targeted Ags to which preexisting Abs are more likely to be present in the clinical responders compared with nonresponders. The majority of Ab responses are patient-specific, but immune responses against Ags shared among clinical responders are also detected. One of these shared Ags is PAK6, which is expressed in prostate cancer and to which CD4(+) T cell responses were also induced. Moreover, immunization with PAK6 can be both immunogenic and protective in mouse tumor models.

The reasons for the observed rates of screening are unknown, and few studies have examined the relationship of psychological health to PSA screening rates. Understanding this relationship can help guide interventions to improve informed decision-making for screening.  Methods:   A nationally representative sample of men 57-85 years old without prostate cancer (N = 1169) from the National Social life, Health and Aging Project was analyzed. The independent relationship of validated psychological health scales measuring stress, anxiety, and depression to PSA testing rates was assessed using multivariable logistic regression analyses.  Results:   PSA screening rates were significantly lower for men with higher perceived stress [odds ratio (OR) = 0.76, P = 0.006], but not for higher depressive symptoms (OR = 0.89, P = 0.22) when accounting for stress. Anxiety influences PSA screening through an interaction with number of doctor visits (P = 0.02). Among the men who visited the doctor once those with higher anxiety were less likely to be screened (OR = 0.65, P = 0.04). Conversely, those who visited the doctor 10+ times with higher anxiety were more likely to be screened (OR = 1.71, P = 0.04).  Conclusions:   Perceived stress significantly lowers PSA screening likelihood, and it seems to partly mediate the negative relationship of depression with screening likelihood. Anxiety affects PSA screening rates differently for men with different numbers of doctor visits. Interventions to influence PSA screening rates should recognize the role of the patients' psychological state to improve their likelihood of making informed decisions and improve screening appropriateness.""","""['Ashwin A Kotwal', 'Phil Schumm', 'Supriya G Mohile', 'William Dale']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Med Care""","""['Measuring the psychosocial impact of population-based prostate-specific antigen testing for prostate cancer in the UK.', 'National evidence on the use of shared decision making in prostate-specific antigen screening.', ""Prostate specific antigen testing is associated with men's psychological and physical health and their healthcare utilisation in a nationally representative sample: a cross-sectional study."", 'A review of prostate-specific antigen screening prevalence and risk perceptions for first-degree relatives of men with prostate cancer.', 'Patient Perceptions and Shared Decisions About PSA Screening.', 'Circadian Rhythm Disruption as a Contributor to Racial Disparities in Prostate Cancer.', 'Copy number variation of urine exfoliated cells by low-coverage whole genome sequencing for diagnosis of prostate adenocarcinoma: a prospective cohort study.', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen Screening According to Health Professional Counseling and Age in the United States.', 'Psychosocial Correlates of Experience and Intention to Receive Colorectal Cancer Screening: A Cross-Sectional Study Among East African Men in the U.S.', 'Sexual Obligation and Perceived Stress: A National Longitudinal Study of Older Adults.']"""

Rectal gas can distend the rectum and displace the prostate even in the presence of ERBs. The purpose of this work was to quantify the effects an ERB with a passive gas release conduit had on the incidence of rectal gas. Fifteen patients who were treated with a standard ERB and 15 with a gas-release ERB were selected for this retrospective study. Location and cross-sectional area of gas pockets and the fraction of time they occurred on 1133 lateral kilovoltage (kV) images were analyzed. Gas locations were classified as trapped between the ERB and anterior rectal wall, between the ERB and posterior rectal wall, or superior to the ERB. For patients using the standard ERB, gas was found in at least one region in 45.8% of fractions. Gas was trapped in the anterior region in 37.1% of fractions, in the posterior region in 5.0% of fractions, and in the sigmoid region in 9.6% of fractions. For patients using the ERB with the gas-release conduit, gas was found in at least one region in 19.7% of fractions. Gas was trapped in the anterior region in 5.6% of fractions, in the posterior region in 8.3% of fractions, and in the sigmoid region in 7.4% of fractions. Both the number of fractions with gas in the anterior region and the number of fractions with gas in at least one region were significantly higher in the former group than in the latter. The cross-sectional area of trapped gas did not differ between the two groups.

There are a variety of IMRT QA techniques which have been proposed and clinically used with a common understanding that not one single method can detect all possible errors. The aim of this work was to compare the efficiency and effectiveness of independent dose calculation followed by machine log file analysis to conventional measurement-based methods in detecting errors in IMRT delivery. Sixteen IMRT treatment plans (5 head-and-neck, 3 rectum, 3 breast, and 5 prostate plans) created with a commercial treatment planning system (TPS) were recalculated on a QA phantom. All treatment plans underwent ion chamber (IC) and 2D diode array measurements. The same set of plans was also recomputed with another commercial treatment planning system and the two sets of calculations were compared. The deviations between dosimetric measurements and independent dose calculation were evaluated. The comparisons included evaluations of DVHs and point doses calculated by the two TPS systems. Machine log files were captured during pretreatment composite point dose measurements and analyzed to verify data transfer and performance of the delivery machine. Average deviation between IC measurements and point dose calculations with the two TPSs for head-and-neck plans were 1.2 ± 1.3% and 1.4 ± 1.6%, respectively. For 2D diode array measurements, the mean gamma value with 3% dose difference and 3 mm distance-to-agreement was within 1.5% for 13 of 16 plans. The mean 3D dose differences calculated from two TPSs were within 3% for head-and-neck cases and within 2% for other plans. The machine log file analysis showed that the gantry angle, jaw position, collimator angle, and MUs were consistent as planned, and maximal MLC position error was less than 0.5 mm. The independent dose calculation followed by the machine log analysis takes an average 47 ± 6 minutes, while the experimental approach (using IC and 2D diode array measurements) takes an average about 2 hours in our clinic. Independent dose calculation followed by machine log file analysis can be a reliable tool to verify IMRT treatments. Additionally, independent dose calculations have the potential to identify several problems (heterogeneity calculations, data corruptions, system failures) with the primary TPS, which generally are not identifiable with a measurement-based approach. Additionally, machine log file analysis can identify many problems (gantry, collimator, jaw setting) which also may not be detected with a measurement-based approach. Machine log file analysis could also detect performance problems for individual MLC leaves which could be masked in the analysis of a measured fluence.""","""['Baozhou Sun', 'Dharanipathy Rangaraj', 'Sunita Boddu', 'Murty Goddu', 'Deshan Yang', 'Geethpriya Palaniswaamy', 'Sridhar Yaddanapudi', 'Omar Wooten', 'Sasa Mutic']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""J Appl Clin Med Phys""","""['Phantomless patient-specific TomoTherapy QA via delivery performance monitoring and a secondary Monte Carlo dose calculation.', 'A method to reconstruct and apply 3D primary fluence for treatment delivery verification.', 'Correlation of phantom-based and log file patient-specific QA with complexity scores for VMAT.', 'Report of AAPM Task Group 219 on independent calculation-based dose/MU verification for IMRT.', 'A six-year review of more than 13,000 patient-specific IMRT QA results from 13 different treatment sites.', 'Prediction of portal dosimetry quality assurance results using log files-derived errors and machine learning techniques.', 'Do we need patient-specific QA for adaptively generated plans?

Currently, biological optimization for these plans is not feasible due to the amount of time necessary to calculate the BED distribution. This study provides a fast calculation method, based on the total dose, to calculate the BED distribution. Distributions of various numbers of hybrid seeds were used to calculate total dose distributions, as well as BED distributions. Hybrid seeds are a mixture of different isotopes (in this study (125)I and (103)Pd). Three ratios of hybrid seeds were investigated: 25/75, 50/50, and 75/25. The total dose and BED value from each voxel were coupled together to produce graphs of total dose vs. BED. Equations were then derived from these graphs. The study investigated four types of tissue: bladder, rectum, prostate, and other normal tissue. Equations were derived from the total dose - BED correspondence. Accuracy of conversion from total dose to BED was within 2 Gy; however, accuracy of conversion was found to be better for high total dose regions as compared to lower dose regions. The method introduced in this paper allows one to perform fast conversion of total dose to BED for brachytherapy using hybrid seeds, which makes the BED-based plan optimization practical. The method defined here can be extended to other ratios, as well as other tissues that are affected by permanent seed implant brachytherapy (i.e., breast).""","""['Jakub Pritz', 'Kenneth M Forster', 'Amarjit S Saini', 'Matthew C Biagioli', 'Geoffrey G Zhang']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""J Appl Clin Med Phys""","""['Calculating prescription doses for new sources by biologically effective dose matching.', 'Inverse planning optimization for hybrid prostate permanent-seed implant brachytherapy plans using two source strengths.', 'Biologically effective dose (BED) for interstitial seed implants containing a mixture of radionuclides with different half-lives.', 'Dose homogeneity as a function of source activity in optimized I-125 prostate implant treatment plans.', 'Physical brachytherapy planning.', 'Determining Combined Modality Dosimetric Constraints by Integration of IMRT and LDR Prostate Brachytherapy Dosimetry and Correlation with Toxicity.', 'Biological effective dose in analysis of rectal dose in prostate cancer patients who underwent a combination therapy of VMAT and LDR with hydrogel spacer insertion.', 'Long-term outcomes of two different treatment concepts with HDR brachytherapy boost for intermediate-risk prostate cancer.']"""

AAPM TG 119 proposes a set of test clinical cases for testing the accuracy of IMRT planning and delivery system. For these test cases, we generated two treatment plans, the first plan using 7-9 static dMLC IMRT fields and a second plan utilizing one- or two-arc VMAT technique. Dose optimization and calculations performed using 6 MV photons and Eclipse treatment planning system. Dose prescription and planning objectives were set according to the TG 119 goals. Plans were scored based on TG 119 planning objectives. Treatment plans were compared using conformity index (CI) for reference dose and homogeneity index (HI) (for D(5)-D(95)). For test cases prostate, head-and-neck, C-shape and multitarget prescription dose are 75.6 Gy, 50.4 Gy, 50 Gy and 50 Gy, respectively. VMAT dose distributions were comparable to dMLC IMRT plans. Our planning results matched TG 119 planning results. For treatment plans studied, conformity indices ranged from 1.05-1.23 (IMRT) and 1.04-1.23 (VMAT). Homogeneity indices ranged from 4.6%-11.0% (IMRT) and 4.6%-10.5% (VMAT). The ratio of total monitor units necessary for dMLC IMRT to that of VMAT was in the range of 1.1-2.0. AAPM TG 119 test cases are useful to generate VMAT benchmark plans.

A strong correlation exists between PKCε overexpression and NF-κB activation status in prostate cancer cells. Moreover, transgenic overexpression of PKCε in the mouse prostate causes preneoplastic lesions that display significant NF-κB hyperactivation. PKCε RNAi depletion or inhibition in prostate cancer cells diminishes NF-κB translocation to the nucleus with subsequent impairment of both activation of NF-κB transcription and induction of NF-κB responsive genes in response to the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα). On the other hand, PKCε overexpression in normal prostate cells enhances activation of the NF-κB pathway. A mechanistic analysis revealed that TNFα activates PKCε via a C1 domain/diacylglycerol-dependent mechanism that involves phosphatidylcholine-phospholipase C.

Methods and materials:   From 2001-2006, 344 patients received EBRT with HDRB boost for definitive treatment of intermediate- or high-risk prostate cancer. The prescribed EBRT dose was 46 Gy in 23 fractions, with a HDR boost of 19.5 Gy in 3 fractions. This cohort was compared to a contemporaneously treated cohort who received EBRT to 74 Gy in 37 fractions, using a matched pair analysis. Three-dimensional conformal EBRT was used. Matching was performed using a propensity score matching technique. High-risk patients constituted 41% of the matched cohorts. Five-year clinical and biochemical outcomes were analyzed.  Results:   Initial significant differences in prognostic indicators between the unmatched treatment cohorts were rendered negligible after matching, providing a total of 688 patients. Median biochemical follow-up was 60.5 months. The 5-year freedom from biochemical failure was 79.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 74.3%-85.0%) and 70.9% (95% CI, 65.4%-76.0%) for the HDRB and EBRT groups, respectively, equating to a hazard ratio of 0.59 (95% CI, 0.43-0.81, P=.0011). Interaction analyses showed no alteration in HDR efficacy when planned androgen deprivation therapy was administered (P=.95), but a strong trend toward reduced efficacy was shown compared to EBRT in high-risk cases (P=.06).

Similar instruments predict the risk of grade ≥ 3 late toxicity (normal tissue complication probability, NTCP) as a function of SRT dose. Here we explore how changes in the parameters of those models might affect the optimal SRT dose and clinical outcomes.  Materials and methods:   Baseline TCP and NTCP model parameters were established in a previous report. Pre-treatment PSA was set at 0.4 ng/mL. Model parameters were modified to explore four scenarios: (1) improving the safety of SRT, (2) increasing tumor cell radiosensitivity, (3) increasing the cure rate achievable with SRT and (4) adoption of hypofractionated SRT schedules. The ""optimal"" SRT dose, defined as the dose that maximized the likelihood of achieving biochemical control without causing late toxicity, was identified for each scenario.  Results:   Improving the safety of SRT increased the optimal SRT dose, while radiosensitization decreased the optimal dose. Both changes were predicted to increase the probability of biochemical control and decrease late toxicity rates. Increasing the cure rate achievable with SRT (eg: improving patient selection or combining SRT with effective systemic therapy) provided the greatest gains in TCP. Adoption of a hypofractionated SRT schedule was predicted to improve both biochemical control and late toxicity.  Conclusions:   Modeling exercises demonstrate the significant gains that may be achieved with improved implementation of SRT for prostate cancer.

Because of these findings, therapeutic inhibition targeting OATP1B3 has been proposed. However, any enthusiasm for inhibiting OATP1Bs therapeutically has been tempered by reservations about potential consequences.

As a result of this, the informants often played a passive role when or if they discussed issues related to sexuality with someone in the health care organizations.

What's known on the subject? and What does the study add? There is limited data that suggests that men aged >70 years have a higher proportion of Gleason 8-10 prostate cancer than men aged <70 years, as well as a higher risk of PSA recurrence, distant metastases, and disease-specific death on univariate analysis. The present study shows that older as compared with younger men with Gleason score 6 and 7 prostate cancer have an increased risk of prostate cancer-specific mortality. This may be due to the presence of occult high-grade disease and suggests further diagnostic studies, e.g. multiparametric MRI, may be indicated in these men to reduce biopsy sampling error.  Objective:   To determine if advancing age is a risk factor for high-grade prostate cancer due to occult high-grade disease in elderly men with Gleason score 6 or 7 prostate cancer. We investigated whether advancing age is associated with the risk of prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM) within established Gleason score categories adjusting for known predictors of PCSM.  Patients and methods:   Using data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results database between 1 January 2004 to 31 December 2007, 166 104 men with non-metastatic prostate cancer were identified and formed the study cohort. • Within established Gleason score categories, Fine and Gray's multivariable competing risk regressions were used to evaluate whether increasing age at diagnosis was significantly associated with an increased risk of PCSM, adjusting for prostate-specific antigen level and T-category at diagnosis and whether treatment was curative or non-curative.  Results:   After adjusting for treatment and prognostic factors, Gleason score 8-10 and 7 as compared with ≤6 was associated with an increased risk of PCSM (P < 0.001). • Increasing age was associated with an increased risk of PCSM only in Gleason score 6 (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR] 1.06, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04-1.08, P < 0.001) and 7 (AHR 1.02, 95% CI 1.01-1.03, P < 0.001), but not with Gleason score 8-10 (AHR 0.999, 95% CI 0.995-1.003, P= 0.61). • These risks were highest in men aged >70 years having Gleason score 6 (AHR 1.10, 95% CI 1.07-1.13, P < 0.001) and Gleason score 7 prostate cancer (AHR 1.04, 95% CI 1.02-1.06, P < 0.001).  Conclusions:   PCSM increases with advancing age in men with Gleason score 6 and 7 but not 8-10 prostate cancer. • Techniques to reduce biopsy sampling error in men, particularly those aged >70 years and healthy with Gleason score 6 and 7 disease deserve further study.""","""['Andrea L Russo', 'Ming-Hui Chen', 'Ayal A Aizer', 'Jona A Hattangadi', ""Anthony V D'Amico""]""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Early detection of high-grade prostate cancer using digital rectal examination (DRE) in men with a prostate-specific antigen level of <2.5 ng/mL and the risk of death.', 'Initial management of prostate-specific antigen-detected, low-risk prostate cancer and the risk of death from prostate cancer.', 'Predictors of prostate cancer-specific mortality in elderly men with intermediate-risk prostate cancer treated with brachytherapy with or without external beam radiation therapy.', 'Global update on defining and treating high-risk localized prostate cancer with leuprorelin: a USA perspective--identifying men at diagnosis who are at high risk of prostate cancer death after surgery or radiation therapy.', 'Do Gleason patterns 3 and 4 prostate cancer represent separate disease states?', 'Prostate Cancer: Is It a Battle Lost to Age?', 'Gleason score stratification according to age at diagnosis in 1028 men.', 'Aspirin improves outcome in high risk prostate cancer patients treated with radiation therapy.', 'Prior-cancer diagnosis in men with nonmetastatic prostate cancer and the risk of prostate-cancer-specific and all-cause mortality.']"""

This raised the possibility of a gender link to high n-6 risk potentially explaining both national phenomena. Israeli women's disadvantage was shown by worse international rankings, i.e., life expectancy (LE)--11th vs. men's 3rd-best/22 countries (2000), and 14th vs. 6th/34 (2010); and all-cause and all-cancer mortality--both 15th vs. 2nd-best/22 (2000), and 15th vs. 6th/22 and 12th vs. 2nd-best/22 (2010). Cancer mortality rates for breast were 21.8% above vs. prostate 30.4% below Eur-A (27 country) averages (2005). Gender gaps/ ratios were smaller than European Union-15 averages, i.e., for LE at birth by 34.4-26.4% (2000-2010), respectively, and at 65 years 45.9-35.3%; all-cause mortality by 43.3-33.4%, and all-cancer 65.2-58.7%. The Israeli diet was mostly close to guidelines, but n-6 intake (10-12% kcal) was much higher than recommended and traditional ""Mediterranean diet"" levels. Research showing females' greater potential for conversion of PUFA to long-chain PUFA (LCPUFA) may suggest increased production of n-6 eicosanoids with known proinflammatory/oxidative/carcinogenic potential. An ""Israeli N-6 Gender Nutrition Paradox"" hypothesis is suggested here for the first time, associating women's higher risk and lead in the national ""paradox"" with greater potential for n-6 conversion to pro-inflammatory/oxidative/carcinogenic eicosanoids compared to men. This may also exacerbate women's risk associated with genetic predisposition (i.e., BRCA) and/or sociopolitical stress.

Cancer chemopreventive effect of SFN is characterized by G(2)/M phase cell cycle arrest, apoptosis induction, and inhibition of cell migration and invasion. Moreover, SFN inhibits multiple oncogenic signaling pathways often hyperactive in human cancers, including nuclear factor-κB, Akt, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, and androgen receptor. The present study was designed to determine the role of Notch signaling, which is constitutively active in many human cancers, in anticancer effects of SFN using prostate cancer cells as a model. Exposure of human prostate cancer cells (PC-3, LNCaP, and/or LNCaP-C4-2B) to SFN as well as its naturally-occurring thio-, sulfinyl-, and sulfonyl-analogs resulted in cleavage (activation) of Notch1, Notch2, and Notch4, which was accompanied by a decrease in levels of full-length Notch forms especially at the 16- and 24-hour time points. The SFN-mediated cleavage of Notch isoforms was associated with its transcriptional activation as evidenced by RBP-Jk-, HES-1A/B- and HEY-1 luciferase reporter assays. Migration of PC-3 and LNCaP cells was decreased significantly by RNA interference of Notch1 and Notch2, but not Notch4. Furthermore, SFN-mediated inhibition of PC-3 and LNCaP cell migration was only marginally affected by knockdown of Notch1 and Notch2. Strikingly, SFN administration to Transgenic Adenocarcinoma of Mouse Prostate transgenic mice failed to increase levels of cleaved Notch1, cleaved Notch2, and HES-1 proteins in vivo in prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, well-differentiated carcinoma or poorly-differentiated prostate cancer lesions. These results indicate that Notch activation is largely dispensable for SFN-mediated inhibition of cell migration, which should be viewed as a therapeutic advantage as Notch activation is frequent in human prostate cancers.""","""['Eun-Ryeong Hahm', 'Kumar Chandra-Kuntal', 'Dhimant Desai', 'Shantu Amin', 'Shivendra V Singh']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Notch activation by phenethyl isothiocyanate attenuates its inhibitory effect on prostate cancer cell migration.', 'Notch2 activation by benzyl isothiocyanate impedes its inhibitory effect on breast cancer cell migration.', 'D,L-Sulforaphane causes transcriptional repression of androgen receptor in human prostate cancer cells.', 'Multi-targeted prevention of cancer by sulforaphane.', 'Sulforaphane--a possible agent in prevention and therapy of cancer.', 'Phytochemicals in Inhibition of Prostate Cancer: Evidence from Molecular Mechanisms Studies.', 'Modulation of Notch Signaling Pathway by Bioactive Dietary Agents.', 'Sulforaphane: A Broccoli Bioactive Phytocompound with Cancer Preventive Potential.', 'Glucosinolate-Degradation Products as Co-Adjuvant Therapy on Prostate Cancer in Vitro.', 'Alyssin and Iberin in Cruciferous Vegetables Exert Anticancer Activity in HepG2 by Increasing Intracellular Reactive Oxygen Species and Tubulin Depolymerization.']"""

The hormone kinetics and downstream effects on reproductive organs associated with perturbing androgen regulation are complex and not necessarily intuitive. Inhibition of 5aR decreases the metabolism of testosterone (T) to the potent androgen 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT). This results in decreased cell proliferation, fluid production and 5aR expression as well as increased apoptosis in the ventral prostate. These regulatory changes collectively result in decreased prostate size and function, which can be beneficial to men suffering from benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and could play a role in prostate cancer. There are two distinct isoforms of 5aR in male humans and rats, and thus developing a 5aR inhibitor is a challenging pursuit. Several inhibitors are on the market for treatment of BPH, including finasteride and dutasteride. In this effort, comparisons of simulated vs. experimental T and DHT levels and prostate size are depicted, demonstrating the model accurately described an approximate 77% decrease in prostate size and nearly complete depletion of prostatic DHT following 21 days of daily finasteride dosing in rats. This implies T alone is not capable of maintaining a normal prostate size. Further model analysis suggests the possibility of alternative dosing strategies resulting in similar or greater effects on prostate size, due to complex kinetics between T, DHT and gene occupancy. With appropriate scaling and parameterization for humans, this model provides a multiscale modeling platform for drug discovery teams to test and generate hypotheses about drugging strategies for indications like BPH and prostate cancer, such as compound binding properties, dosing regimens, and target validation.""","""['Michael G Zager', 'Hugh A Barton']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Cynanchum wilfordii Ameliorates Testosterone-Induced Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia by Regulating 5α-Reductase and Androgen Receptor Activities in a Rat Model.', 'Prostate cancer cells differ in testosterone accumulation, dihydrotestosterone conversion, and androgen receptor signaling response to steroid 5α-reductase inhibitors.', 'Inhibition of 5alpha-reductase in rat prostate reveals differential regulation of androgen-response gene expression by testosterone and dihydrotestosterone.', 'Dihydrotestosterone and the concept of 5alpha-reductase inhibition in human benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'Dihydrotestosterone and the concept of 5alpha-reductase inhibition in human benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'Selecting a minimal set of androgen receptor assays for screening chemicals.', 'A mechanistic, multiscale mathematical model of immunogenicity for therapeutic proteins: part 1-theoretical model.', 'A mathematical model of the effect of immunogenicity on therapeutic protein pharmacokinetics.']"""

It interacts with diverse groups of intercellular and extracellular proteins, regulating cell adhesion, motility, apoptosis and angiogenesis, and is involved in mammary gland development. As MASPIN is a multifunctional factor in cancer pathways, its function remains poorly illuminated. In this study, we compared the protein profiles of LC5 cell lines with MASPIN overexpression and knockdown using comparative two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. The differences in protein expression, visualized as differences in spots, were identified by time-of-flight (TOF)/TOF mass spectometry. Significant differences were observed between overexpressing and knocked down cells, including eight spots that were unique and sixteen spots that were up- or down-regulated by more than 4-fold. Six genes, including Sdccag8, Ldoc1, SCAI, SDCCAG3, CT62 and NEDD9 were unique in MASPIN-expressing cell lines, but absent in knock-out cell lines, in which most of them play a significant role in the invasion of cancer cells. Moreover, the Brms1 and CAGE1 genes were identified as being uniquely expressed in knocked down cell lines, which were associated with the development and progression of tumors. The data from this study shed some light on the function, as well as the general network mechanisms of MASPIN in lung cancer.""","""['Yao Liu', 'Yi Geng', 'Kuanzhi Li', 'Fang Wang', 'Haiping Zhou', 'Wanhu Wang', 'Jie Hou', 'Wenchao Liu']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Exp Ther Med""","""['Expression of the tumor suppressor gene Maspin in human pancreatic cancers.', 'Maspin: the new frontier.', 'Modeling human breast cancer metastasis in mice: maspin as a paradigm.', 'Maspin sensitizes prostate cancer cells to doxazosin-induced apoptosis.', 'Mammary serine protease inhibitor (Maspin) binds directly to interferon regulatory factor 6: identification of a novel serpin partnership.', 'Genetic variants of SDCCAG8 and MAGI2 in mitosis-related pathway genes are independent predictors of cutaneous melanoma-specific survival.', 'Variation at ACOT12 and CT62 locus represents susceptibility to psoriasis in Han population.', 'Sox11 promotes head and neck cancer progression via the regulation of SDCCAG8.', 'Non-small-cell lung cancer pathological subtype-related gene selection and bioinformatics analysis based on gene expression profiles.', 'LDOC1 silenced by cigarette exposure and involved in oral neoplastic transformation.']"""

Therefore, response to radiation could potentially be improved by using inhibitors of these abnormally activated pathways. We have investigated the radiosensitizing effects of sunitinib, a potent, multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor of the VEGFR and PDGFR receptors, on human prostate cancer cells.  Methods:   The radiosensitizing effects of sunitinib were assessed on human prostate cancer cell lines DU145, PC3 and LNCaP by clonogenic assay. Sunitinib's ability to inhibit the activities of its key targets was determined by immunoblot analysis. The radiosensitizing effects of sunitinib in vivo were tested on human tumor xenografts growing in nude mice where response was assessed by tumor growth delay.  Results:   Clonogenic survival curve assays for both DU145 and PC3 cells showed that the surviving fraction at 2 Gy was reduced from 0.70 and 0.52 in controls to 0.44 and 0.38, respectively, by a 24 hr pretreatment with 100 nM sunitinib. LNCaP cells were not radiosensitized by sunitinib. Dose dependent decreases in VEGFR and PDGFR activation were also observed following sunitinib in both DU145 and PC3 cells. We assessed the ability of sunitinib to radiosensitize PC3 xenograft tumors growing in the hind limb of nude mice. Sunitinib given concurrently with radiation did not prolong tumor growth delay. However, when animals were treated with sunitinib commencing the day after fractionated radiation was complete, tumor growth delay was enhanced compared to radiation alone.  Conclusions:   We conclude, based on the in vivo results, that sunitinib and radiation do not interact directly to radiosensitize the PC3 tumor cells in vivo as they did in vitro. The fact that tumor growth delay was enhanced when sunitinib was given after radiotherapy was completed suggests that sunitinib may be acting on the irradiated tumor stroma and suppressing its ability to sustain regrowth of the irradiated tumor. Based on these preclinical findings, we suggest that the combination of sunitinib and radiation for the treatment of prostate cancer deserves further development.""","""['Colin Brooks', 'Tommy Sheu', 'Kathleen Bridges', 'Kathy Mason', 'Deborah Kuban', 'Paul Mathew', 'Raymond Meyn']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Radiat Oncol""","""['The preventative effects of sunitinib malate observed in the course from non-castration to castration LNCaP xenograft prostate tumors.', 'Sunitinib reduces tumor hypoxia and angiogenesis, and radiosensitizes prostate cancer stem-like cells.', 'SU11248 inhibits KIT and platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta in preclinical models of human small cell lung cancer.', 'Sunitinib, a multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor, in the management of gastrointestinal stromal tumor.', 'Myeloid-derived suppressor cells adhere to physiologic STAT3- vs STAT5-dependent hematopoietic programming, establishing diverse tumor-mediated mechanisms of immunologic escape.', 'Recent progress of hydrogel-based local drug delivery systems for postoperative radiotherapy.', 'Implantable Bioresponsive Hydrogel Prevents Local Recurrence of Breast Cancer by Enhancing Radiosensitivity.', 'Role and significance of c-KIT receptor tyrosine kinase in cancer: A review.', 'Sunitinib Treatment-elicited Distinct Tumor Microenvironment Dramatically Compensated the Reduction of Myeloid-derived Suppressor Cells.', 'Sensitizing endometrial cancer to ionizing radiation by multi-tyrosine kinase inhibition.']"""

Basal release of extracellular purines and its physiological relevance remain controversial. Here we employed a combination of enzyme-coupled approaches for simultaneous bioluminescent (ATP, ADP, PP(i)) and fluorometric (AMP), adenosine, inosine, hypoxanthine) measurements of ATP and its metabolites without additional manipulations or derivatization of sampled biological fluids. By using these sensing techniques, extracellular purines were determined in various cells and tissues both at resting and pro-inflammatory conditions. The results obtained revealed the ability of endothelial, lymphoid and tumor cells to maintain extracellular ATP, ADP and adenosine at certain characteristic nanomolar levels. By quantifying the amounts of endogenously released and/or exogenously applied purines and their metabolites, these sensing techniques may be applied for evaluating purine-converting pathways on the cell surfaces and also for ex vivo analysis of purine homeostasis in the intact tissues. Furthermore, we provide novel insight into the mechanisms underlying tumorigenic effects of ATP by demonstrating the ability of metastatic prostate carcinoma PC3 and breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells to maintain PP(i), which derives from extracellular ATP in the course of nucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase reaction. Collectively, the results imply a complex pattern of nucleotide turnover where extracellular ATP, ADP and adenosine are maintained at steady-state levels via conunterbalanced release and inactivation of ATP and other purines, and further suggest the importance of basal agonist release for continuous activation and/or desensitization of purinergic receptors.""","""['Mikko Helenius', 'Sirpa Jalkanen', 'Gennady Yegutkin']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Biochim Biophys Acta""","""['Enzymes involved in metabolism of extracellular nucleotides and nucleosides: functional implications and measurement of activities.', ""Increased intravitreal adenosine 5'-triphosphate, adenosine 5'-diphosphate and adenosine 5'-monophosphate levels in patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy."", 'Extracellular ATP formation on vascular endothelial cells is mediated by ecto-nucleotide kinase activities via phosphotransfer reactions.', 'Soluble purine-converting enzymes circulate in human blood and regulate extracellular ATP level via counteracting pyrophosphatase and phosphotransfer reactions.', 'Trophic effects of purines in neurons and glial cells.', 'A new enzymatic assay to quantify inorganic pyrophosphate in plasma.', 'An NTP-driven mechanism for the nucleotide addition cycle of Escherichia coli RNA polymerase during transcription.', 'Purinergic Signaling in Oral Tissues.', 'CD73 (NT5E) Promotes the Proliferation and Metastasis of Lung Adenocarcinoma through the EGFR/AKT/mTOR Pathway.', 'ATP and Adenosine Metabolism in Cancer: Exploitation for Therapeutic Gain.']"""

The aim of this study was to explore the expression of PCA3 mRNA and PRUNE2 in leiomyosarcoma and their correlation.  Methods:   The expression of PRUNE2 mRNA was analyzed by agilent gene expression microarray CHIP in 31 leiomyosarcomas and 37 GISTs, and the correlation of the PRUNE2 expression and prognosis of leiomyosarcoma was predicted.

Results:   The level of PRUNE2 mRNA expression was significantly higher in the 31 leiomyosarcomas than that in the 37 GISTs, and the level of PRUNE2 mRNA expression was correlated with survival of the leiomyosarcoma patients. Compared with prostate cancer, the non-coding RNA PCA3 expression level was significantly lower in leiomyosarcoma, and it had no correlation with the prognosis of leiomyosarcoma.

The clinicopathologic findings of patients and surgical outcomes of PLND with each procedure were measured. Kaplan-Meier and log rank tests were used to estimate BCR-free survival rates. Univariate and multivariate survival analyses were done with the Cox proportional hazard regression model.  Results:   Medians of 15 (interquartile range, 11-19) and 24 (interquartile range, 18-28) lymph nodes were dissected in Groups 1 and 2, respectively (P<.001).

Patients were divided then into three groups based on the method used to target the mp-MRI designated region of interest (ROI): Group 1 underwent TRUS-guided prostate biopsy using an MRI-based coordinate plan (cognitive targeting). Group 2 underwent MRI-targeted TRUS-guided prostate biopsy using MyLabTMTwice, which superimposed the archived MRI images onto the real-time ultrasonography image allowing targeted biopsy of the ROI (fusion targeting).

Results:   The cancer detection rate in group 1 was 33.3% (3 of 10 patients), while in group 2, it was significantly higher at 46.2%. The sensitivity and specificity for group 1 was 45.5% and 33.3%, vs 61.9% and 20.8% in group 2, respectively. The positive predictive value in group 1 was 50.0% vs 53.8% in group 2 (P=0.04).

Some studies have evaluated preoperative and intraoperative examination for inguinal hernias and their repair, noting a decrease in the rate of post-prostatectomy hernias. However, this did not eradicate post-prostatectomy hernias, indicating that this method probably missed subclinical hernias. Other studies looked at prophylactic procedures to prevent the formation of inguinal hernias at the time of prostatectomy and showed a decrease in the rate of postoperative hernias. To our knowledge this is the only series evaluating a multi-modal approach with magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasonography and examination to identify all clinical and subclinical hernias and repair them at the time of prostatectomy. This approach only subjects those patients at risk for symptomatic hernias to an additional procedure and decreases the post-prostatectomy hernia rate to <1%.  Objective:   • To assess if a comprehensive evaluation to diagnose clinical and subclinical hernias and repair of these hernias at the time of open radical retropubic prostatectomy (ORRP) decreases the incidence of clinical inguinal hernias (IHs) after ORRP.  Patients and methods:   • Between 1 July 2007 and 31 July 2010, 281 consecutive men underwent ORRP by a single surgeon. • Of these men, 207 (74%) underwent comprehensive preoperative screening for IH, which included physical examination, upstanding ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging. • Between 12 and 24 months after ORRP, 178 (86%) of these men completed a questionnaire designed to capture development of clinical IHs.  Results:   • Of the 178 evaluable patients, 92 (52%) were diagnosed preoperatively with IH by at least one diagnostic modality. • Forty-one and 51 of the men had bilateral or unilateral IHs, respectively for a total of 133 IHs. • No preoperative factor was significantly associated with the presence of an IH before prostatectomy. • No groin subjected to IH repair (IHR) at the time of ORRP developed a clinical IH compared with four of the 21 patients with postoperative IHs who did not undergo repair of their preoperatively diagnosed IH at the time of ORRP (P= 0.024). • Only one (0.4%) clinical IH developed in a groin that had no evidence of IH by physical examination, upstanding ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging before prostatectomy.  Conclusions:   • Our comprehensive evaluation increases the detection of IHs before ORRP. • Repair of these IHs at the time of ORRP significantly decreases the risk of developing post-prostatectomy clinical IHs.""","""['Tracy Marien', 'Bachir Taouli', 'Shpetim Telegrafi', 'James S Babb', 'Herbert Lepor']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Comprehensive preoperative evaluation and repair of inguinal hernias at the time of open radical retropubic prostatectomy decreases risk of developing postprostatectomy hernia.', 'Optimizing the detection of subclinical inguinal hernias in men undergoing open radical retropubic prostatectomy.', 'Inguinal hernias in men undergoing open radical retropubic prostatectomy.', 'Post-radical retropubic prostatectomy inguinal hernia: an analysis of risk factors with special reference to preoperative inguinal hernia morbidity and pelvic lymph node dissection.', 'Outcomes of Minimally Invasive Inguinal Hernia Repair at the Time of Robotic Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Inguinal hernia after radical retropubic prostatectomy: risk factors and prevention.']"""

We have previously demonstrated that prostate cancer cells secrete receptor activator of NF-kB ligand (RANKL), a protein essential for osteoclast differentiation and activation. However, the mechanism(s) by which RANKL is produced remains to be determined. The objective of this study is to gain insight into the molecular mechanisms controlling RANKL expression in metastatic prostate cancer cells.  Results:   We show here that phosphorylation of Smad 5 by integrin αvβ3 and RUNX2 by CD44 signaling, respectively, regulates RANKL expression in human-derived PC3 prostate cancer cells isolated from bone metastasis. We found that RUNX2 intranuclear targeting is mediated by phosphorylation of Smad 5. Indeed, Smad5 knock-down via RNA interference and inhibition of Smad 5 phosphorylation by an αv inhibitor reduced RUNX2 nuclear localization and RANKL expression. Similarly, knockdown of CD44 or RUNX2 attenuated the expression of RANKL. As a result, conditioned media from these cells failed to support osteoclast differentiation in vitro. Immunohistochemistry analysis of tissue microarray sections containing primary prostatic tumor (grade2-4) detected predominant localization of RUNX2 and phosphorylated Smad 5 in the nuclei. Immunoblotting analyses of nuclear lysates from prostate tumor tissue corroborate these observations.  Conclusions:   Collectively, we show that CD44 signaling regulates phosphorylation of RUNX2. Localization of RUNX2 in the nucleus requires phosphorylation of Smad-5 by integrin αvβ3 signaling. Our results suggest possible integration of two different pathways in the expression of RANKL. These observations imply a novel mechanistic insight into the role of these proteins in bone loss associated with bone metastases in patients with prostate cancer.""","""['Aditi Gupta', 'Wei Cao', 'Meenakshi A Chellaiah']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Mol Cancer""","""['DU145 human prostate cancer cells express functional receptor activator of NFkappaB: new insights in the prostate cancer bone metastasis process.', 'Characterization of CD44 intracellular domain interaction with RUNX2 in PC3 human prostate cancer cells.', 'Butein, a tetrahydroxychalcone, suppresses cancer-induced osteoclastogenesis through inhibition of receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB ligand signaling.', 'Targeting the receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB (RANK) ligand in prostate cancer bone metastases.', 'Regulatory mechanisms of osteoblast and osteoclast differentiation.', 'The role of integrin family in bone metabolism and tumor bone metastasis.', 'RUNX2 promotes the suppression of osteoblast function and enhancement of osteoclast activity by multiple myeloma cells.', 'The Innate Immune Microenvironment in Metastatic Breast Cancer.', 'RUNX2 interacts with SCD1 and activates Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway to promote the progression of clear cell renal cell carcinoma.', 'miR-218-5p/RUNX2 Axis Positively Regulates Proliferation and Is Associated with Poor Prognosis in Cervical Cancer.']"""

Results:   Conventional fractionation data yielded logit dose response parameters for all risk groups and for all definitions of biochemical failures. The analysis of hypofractionation data led to very low α/β values (1-1.7 Gy) in all mentioned cases. Neglecting the correction for overall treatment time has little impact on the derivation of α/β values for prostate cancers.

Patients and methods:   From June 2011 to March 2012, 10 patients with symptomatic prostatomegaly on transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS) (mean 81 g) underwent IF-RSP. Three patients had acute urinary retention. Demographic perioperative and outcome data were recorded up to 1 month follow-up.  Results:   Average age was 71.7 years (range 60-79 years), estimated blood loss was 375 mL (range 150-900 mL), operative time was 106 minutes (range 60-180 min), hospital stay was 1 day (range 0-3 days), and Foley catheter duration was 8.9 days (range 6-14 days). The drain was removed at a mean 2.8 days (range 0-8 days). Mean prostate volume on preoperative TRUS was 81 cc (range 47-153 cc). Mean specimen weight was 81 g (range 50-150 g). Improvement was noted in the International Prostate Symptom Score (preoperative vs postoperative 18.8 vs 1.7) and peak flow rate (12.4 vs 33.49 mL/min).

Yet, few studies examine patient perspectives on these physicians' roles in their cancer follow-up care or their care preferences. METHODS We explored survivor preferences through qualitative, semistructured, in-depth interviews drawing on patients recruited from 2 National Cancer Institute-designated comprehensive cancer centers and 6 community hospitals. We recruited a purposive sample of early-stage breast and prostate cancer survivors aged 47 to 80 years, stratified by age, race, and length of time from and location of cancer treatment. Survivors were at least 2 years beyond completion of their active cancer treatment RESULTS Forty-two survivors participated in the study. Most participants expressed strong preferences to receive follow-up care from their cancer specialists (52%). They described the following barriers to the primary care physician's engagement in follow-up care: (1) lack of cancer expertise, (2) limited or no involvement with original cancer care, and (3) lack of care continuity. Only one-third of participants (38%) believed there was a role for primary care in cancer follow-up care and suggested the following opportunities: (1) performing routine cancer-screening tests, (2) supplementing cancer and cancer-related specialist care, and (3) providing follow-up medical care when ""enough time has passed"" or the survivors felt that they could reintegrate into the noncancer population. CONCLUSION Survivors have concerns about seeing their primary care physician for cancer-related follow-up care.

Materials and methods:   One hundred consecutive male patients were subjected to radical cystectomy for bladder cancer with routine FSA obtained from distal prostatic urethral margin. Definitive pathological condition of the specimens was reviewed to diagnose urethral±prostatic malignant involvement. The diagnostic value of FSA was identified and compared with different clinical and pathological predictors. Patients with false-negative results were followed for 5 years.  Results:   Six patients showed evidence of malignancy by FSA of the prostatic urethral margin (one patient was false positive), and all were managed by urethrectomy. Prostatic ± urethral involvement was diagnosed in 15 patients by definitive histopathology (15%). Sensitivity and specificity of urethral margin frozen section were 33.3 and 98.8%, respectively, with overall accuracy of 89% while positive and negative predictive values were 83.3 and 89.4%, respectively. There was no significant correlation identified between tumor site or morphology, clinical staging, clinically suspicious prostate, cystoscopic involvement of bladder neck, tumor grade, and associated carcinoma in situ or nodal involvement with prostatic malignant involvement. Positive intraoperative FSA was the only predictor significantly associated with malignant urothelial involvement of the prostate. None of the 10 patients with false-negative results developed late urethral recurrence at 5 years.

The presence of cancer at the surgical margin is associated with higher probability of disease progression. Current methods of intraoperative margin assessment are inaccurate or time-consuming.The study goal was to evaluate the ability of a novel device (Dune Medical Devices) to differentiate between cancer and BPH.  Methods:   A total of 49 patients undergoing RP in four medical centers between November 2007 and May 2008 were enrolled in this study.The device was applied to numerous intra- and extra-capsular sites of freshly excised RP specimens. Measurement sites were accurately marked and analyzed histologically. The ability of the device to differentiate between malignant and nonmalignant sites was assessed.  Results:   A total of 15,156 measurements from 45 patients were analyzed. Differentiation of the intra-capsular malignant sites from extra-capsular nonmalignant sites (bladder neck and apex regions) depends on the cancer feature size. Differentiation was achieved with sensitivity and specificity of 93.6 (95% confidence interval (CI): 88-98) and 94.1 (95% CI: 93-95), respectively, at feature sizes at or >0.8 mm in diameter.

Although, it has been recognized that PCa cells have unique metabolic features, their glycolytic profile in androgen-dependent and androgen-independent stages of disease is much less known. Hence, the main purpose of this study was to compare glucose metabolism in androgen-responsive (LNCaP) and androgen-nonresponsive (PC3) PCa cells. Cell culture medium was collected and differences in glucose consumption and, lactate and alanine production were measured using Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ((1)H NMR) spectra analysis. The mRNA and protein expression of glucose transporters (GLUT1 and GLUT3), phosphofructokinase 1 (PFK1), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and monocarboxylate transporter (MCT4) were determined by real-time PCR and Western Blot, respectively. The obtained results demonstrate that androgen-responsive (LNCaP) and androgen-nonresponsive (PC3) cells consumed similar amounts of glucose, whereas PC3 cells present higher lactate production. This increase in lactate production was concomitant with higher levels of MCT4 protein, increased LDH activity and higher lactate/alanine ratio, also suggesting increased levels of oxidative stress in PC3 cells. However, protein levels of LDH, associated with lactate metabolism, and GLUT3, involved in glucose uptake, were decreased in PC3 comparatively with LNCaP.

Inflammation and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) are associated with poor prognosis and decreased survival in many types of cancer.Vitamin C has been suggested as having both a preventative and therapeutic role in a number of pathologies when administered at much higher-than-recommended dietary allowance levels.Since in vitro studies demonstrated inhibition of pro-inflammatory pathways by millimolar concentrations of vitamin C, we decided to analyze the effects of high dose IVC therapy in suppression of inflammation in cancer patients.  Methods:   45 patients with prostate cancer, breast cancer, bladder cancer, pancreatic cancer, lung cancer, thyroid cancer, skin cancer and B-cell lymphoma were treated at the Riordan Clinic by high doses of vitamin C (7.5 g -50 g) after standard treatments by conventional methods.CRP and tumor markers were measured in serum or heparin-plasma as a routine analysis. In addition, serum samples were collected before and after the IVCs for the cytokine kit tests.  Results:   According to our data positive response to treatment, which was demonstrated by measurements of C- reactive protein, was found in 75% of patients and progression of the inflammation in 25% of patients. IVC treatments on all aggressive stage cancer patients showed the poor response of treatment.There was correlation between tumor markers (PSA, CEA, CA27.29 and CA15-3) and changes in the levels of C-reactive protein.Our test of the effect of IVC on pro-inflammatory cytokines demonstrated that inflammation cytokines IL-1α, IL-2, IL-8, TNF-α, chemokine eotaxin and CRP were reduced significantly after treatments.  Conclusions:   The high dose intravenous ascorbic acid therapy affects C-reactive protein levels and pro-inflammation cytokines in cancer patients. In our study, we found that modulation of inflammation by IVC correlated with decreases in tumor marker levels.In summary, our data support the hypothesis that high dose intravenous ascorbate treatments may reduce inflammation in cancer patients.

It has also been recognized by different groups for prominent anti-carcinogenic roles. However, in spite of these studies on withanolides, their detailed anti-metastatic mechanism of action remained unknown. The current study has poised to address the machinery involved in invasion regulation by stable derivative of Withaferin A, 3-azido Withaferin A (3-azidoWA) in human cervical HeLa and prostate PC-3 cells.  Methods and principal findings:   Sub-toxic concentration of 3-azidowithaferin A (3-azido WA) inhibited cancer cell motility and invasion in wound healing and Boyden chamber invasion by suppressing MMP-2 activity in gelatin zymography and its expression has proved to be a major obstacle in chemo-sensitivity. We have uncovered a novel mechanism of 3-azidoWA induced extracellular pro-apoptotic candidate tumor suppressor Par-4 protein stimulation in conditioned media and also noticed a concomitant marked reduction in pAkt and pERK signaling by immunoblot analysis. Furthermore, our zymography results suggest 3-azidoWA induced MMP-2 inhibition was mediated through secretory Par-4. The inhibition of apoptosis by 3-azidoWA could not restore MMP-2 gelatinase activity. In addition to this, our in vivo animal experiments data showed 3-azidoWA abrogated neovascularisation in dose dependent manner in mouse Matrigel plug assay.  Conclusion/significance:   For this report, we found that 3-azidoWA suppressed motility and invasion of HeLa and PC-3 cells in MMP-2 dependent manner. Our in vitro result strongly suggests that sub-toxic doses of 3-azidoWA enhanced the secretion of extracellular Par-4 that abolished secretory MMP-2 expression and activity.

After confirming the partnership with SHP-1, we observed that codepletion of PNKP and SHP-1 induced apoptosis. A T-cell lymphoma cell line that is SHP-1 deficient (Karpas 299) was shown to be sensitive to a chemical inhibitor of PNKP, but resistance was restored by expression of wild-type SHP-1 in these cells. We determined that while SHP-1 depletion does not significantly impact DNA strand-break repair, it does amplify the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and elevate endogenous DNA damage. The ROS scavenger WR1065 afforded protection to SHP-1-depleted cells treated with the PNKP inhibitor. We propose that codisruption of SHP-1 and PNKP leads to an increase in DNA damage that escapes repair, resulting in the accumulation of cytotoxic double-strand breaks and induction of apoptosis.

Here, lentivirus-mediated small interfering RNA (siRNA) was employed to downregulate endogenous NUPR1 expression to study the function of NUPR1 in growth of nonsmall cell lung cancer. A lentivirus-mediated RNAi technology was used to specifically knock down the expression of NUPR1 in H1299 cells. Quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, flow cytometry, western blot and cell count assays were studied to characterize NUPR1 expression in vitro. Furthermore, nonsmall cell lung cancer xenograft models in nude mice were established to investigate whether knockdown of NUPR1 reduces the tumor growth in vivo. We found that downregulation of NUPR1 expression significantly inhibited nonsmall cell lung cancer H1299 cells proliferation and colony formation in vitro. Moreover, the specific downregulation of NUPR1 arrested cells in G0 phase of cell cycle and increased apoptosis rate. Silencing of NUPR1 also suppressed tumor growth by tail vein injection of lentivirus encoded shRNA against NUPR1 in vivo.

Meanwhile, an unbiased estimator, the Pohar-Perme estimator (PPE), was recently proposed. Using real data, we investigated the magnitude of the errors made by four ""relative-survival"" methods (Ederer I, Hakulinen, Ederer II and a univariable regression model) vs. PPE as reference and examined the influence of time of follow-up, cancer prognosis, and age on the errors made. The data concerned seven cancer sites (2,51,316 cases) collected by FRANCIM cancer registries. Net survivals were estimated at 5, 10 and 15 years postdiagnosis. At 5 years, the errors were generally small. At 10 years, in good-prognosis cancers, the errors made in nonstandardized estimates with all classical methods were generally great (+2.7 to +9% points in prostate cancer) and increased in age-class estimations (vs. 5-year ones). At 15 years, in bad- or average-prognosis cancers, the errors were often substantial whatever the nature of the estimation. In good-prognosis cancers, the errors in nonstandardized estimates of all classical methods were great and sometimes very important. With all classical methods, great errors occurred in age-class estimates resulting in errors in age-standardized estimates (+0.4 to +3.2% points in breast cancer).

South Asian ethnicity was assigned to patients recorded in the population-based National Cancer Registry of England during 1986-2004, using the computerized algorithm SANGRA: South Asian Names and Groups Recognition Algorithm. Population denominators were derived from population censuses. Multivariable flexible (splines) Poisson models were used to estimate trends and socioeconomic differentials in incidence in South Asians compared to non-South Asians. Overall, age-adjusted cancer incidence in South Asians was half that in non-South Asians but rose over time. Cancer-specific incidence trends and patterns by age and deprivation differed widely between the two ethnic groups. In contrast to non-South Asians, lung cancer incidence in South Asians did not fall. Colorectal and breast cancer incidence rose in both groups, more steeply in South Asians though remaining less common than in non-South Asians. The deprivation gaps in cancer-specific incidence were much less marked among South Asians, explaining some of the ethnic differences in overall incidence. Although still lower than in non-South Asians, cancer incidence is rising in South Asians, supporting the concept of transition in cancer incidence among South Asians living in England. Although these trends vary by cancer, they have important implications for both prevention and anticipating health-care demand.""","""['Camille Maringe', 'Punam Mangtani', 'Bernard Rachet', 'David A Leon', 'Michel P Coleman', 'Isabel dos Santos Silva']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Int J Cancer""","""['Cancer survival differences between South Asians and non-South Asians of England in 1986-2004, accounting for age at diagnosis and deprivation.', 'Survival from breast cancer among South Asian and non-South Asian women resident in South East England.', 'Incidence rate trends in childhood type 1 diabetes in Yorkshire, UK 1978-2007: effects of deprivation and age at diagnosis in the South Asian and non-South Asian populations.', 'South Asians and coronary disease: is there discordance between effects on incidence and prognosis?', 'New answers to three questions on the epidemic of coronary mortality in south Asians: incidence or case fatality?

These cells included normal and H-ras-transformed NIH3T3 fibroblast cells, normal and oncoprotein-overexpressing MCF10A breast cancer cells, and weakly and strongly metastatic cancer cell line pairs originating from human cancers of the skin (A375P and A375SM cells), kidney (SN12C and SN12PM6 cells), prostate (PC3M and PC3MLN4 cells), and bladder (253J and 253JB5 cells). Using magnetic twisting cytometry, cytoskeletal stiffness (g') and internal friction (g″) were measured over a wide frequency range. The dependencies of g' and g″ upon frequency were used to determine the power law exponent x which is a direct measure of cytoskeletal fluidity and quantifies where the cytoskeleton resides along the spectrum of solid-like (x = 1) to fluid-like (x = 2) states. Cytoskeletal fluidity x increased following transformation by H-ras oncogene expression in NIH3T3 cells, overexpression of ErbB2 and 14-3-3-ζ in MCF10A cells, and implantation and growth of PC3M and 253J cells in the prostate and bladder, respectively. Each of these perturbations that had previously been shown to enhance cancer cell motility and invasion are shown here to shift the cytoskeleton towards a more fluid-like state. In contrast, strongly metastatic A375SM and SN12PM6 cells that disseminate by lodging in the microcirculation of peripheral organs had smaller x than did their weakly metastatic cell line pairs A375P and SN12C, respectively. Thus, enhanced hematological dissemination was associated with decreased x and a shift towards a more solid-like cytoskeleton. Taken together, these results are consistent with the notion that adaptations known to enhance metastatic ability in cancer cell lines define a spectrum of fluid-like versus solid-like states, and the position of the cancer cell within this spectrum may be a determinant of cancer progression.""","""['Mark F Coughlin', 'Diane R Bielenberg', 'Guillaume Lenormand', 'Marina Marinkovic', 'Carol G Waghorne', 'Bruce R Zetter', 'Jeffrey J Fredberg']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Clin Exp Metastasis""","""['Changes in cytoskeletal dynamics and nonlinear rheology with metastatic ability in cancer cell lines.', 'X-ray radiation promotes the metastatic potential of tongue squamous cell carcinoma cells via modulation of biomechanical and cytoskeletal properties.', 'T24 HRAS transformed NIH/3T3 mouse cells (GhrasT-NIH/3T3) in serial tumorigenic in vitro/in vivo passages give rise to increasingly aggressive tumorigenic cell lines T1-A and T2-A and metastatic cell lines T3-HA and T4-PA.', 'Cell motility and cytoskeletal regulation in invasion and metastasis.', 'Cytoskeleton-associated proteins: their role as cellular integrators in the neoplastic process.', 'An In Vitro Approach to Model EMT in Breast Cancer.', 'Integrating mechanical sensor readouts into organ-on-a-chip platforms.', 'Mechanical Properties of Colorectal Cancer Cells Determined by Dynamic Atomic Force Microscopy: A Novel Biomarker.', 'Adhesion strength and anti-tumor agents regulate vinculin of breast cancer cells.', 'The Outside-In Journey of Tissue Transglutaminase in Cancer.']"""

This work was therefore an attempt to evaluate the possible roles of lipids, antioxidants, and trace metals in breaking the diagnostic tie between Pca and BPH.  Materials and methods:   Anthropometric characteristics, total prostate specific antigen (tPSA), serum lipids (total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides), Vit. E, total antioxidant status (TAS), and trace metals (Se, Cu, Fe, Zn, and Mn) were determined in 40 patients with histopathological diagnosis of BPH and Pca. Forty age matched control subjects were also recruited from the same community. Informed consent was obtained from all the participants in the study. A P-value < 0.05 was considered significant.  Results:   There were significant variations in the weight, hip circumference, and body mass index (BMI) across the group but the post hoc test did not show any difference between patients with prostate cancer and BPH. Among the biochemical parameters studied, only the total cholesterol and triglyceride differed significantly between patients with BPH and prostate cancer patients. Cut-offs from ROC for BPH and prostate cancer at 88.9 sensitivity and 66.7% specificity (95% CI) were 88.5 mg and 161 mg/dl for triglycerides and cholesterol respectively. Furthermore there were no significant variations in the mean levels of copper and tPSA, Vit E, and LDL cholesterol among the study subjects and the controls.  Conclusion:   Prior to prostate biopsy, serum lipid (especially, fasting triglycerides, total cholesterol) could help in early discrimination of patients with BPH from prostate cancer in adjunct to total PSA and other management protocol for diagnosis of prostate cancer. The use of trace metal or antioxidants may have limited advantages. Further studies in this regard will be very desirable to see if this pattern of triglyceride and total cholesterol values in BPH and Pca are sustainable.""","""['K S Adedapo', 'O G Arinola', 'O B Shittu', 'O I Kareem', 'C A Okolo', 'L N Nwobi']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Niger J Clin Pract""","""['Biomarkers That Differentiate Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia from Prostate Cancer: A Literature Review.', 'Accurate cut-off point for free to total prostate-specific antigen ratio used to improve differentiation of prostate cancer from benign prostate hyperplasia in Iranian population.', 'Percent free PSA as an additional measure in a prostate cancer screen.', 'Changes of serum total PSA and free PSA in patients with prostate carcinoma and benign prostate hyperplasia.', 'Oxidative stress in benign prostatic hyperplasia: a systematic review.', 'Genetically predicted iron status was associated with the risk of prostate cancer.', 'Biomarkers That Differentiate Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia from Prostate Cancer: A Literature Review.', 'Serum Levels of Selenium, Zinc, Copper, Manganese, and Iron in Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'Status and Interrelationship of Zinc, Copper, Iron, Calcium and Selenium in Prostate Cancer.', 'Association of serum lipid levels and prostate cancer severity among Hispanic Puerto Rican men.']"""

The aim of this study was to emphasize that the levels of E2F3 are increased in breast cancer and highlights the efficacy of siRNA targeted to E2F3.  Methods:   To investigate the expression level of E2F3 and the progression of breast tumors, quantitative real-time PCR analysis was carried out. Western blotting analysis was performed to measure its counterparts, namely, E2F3a and E2F3b.  Results:   In the novel axis of E2F3, a large set of 11 breast cancer cell lines were identified to have the property of overexpression. Furthermore, the small interfering RNA (siRNA) developed against E2F3 significantly blocked the expression of the E2F3 in the selected breast cancer cell lines. Thus, the present findings authenticate the efficiency of siRNA (E2F3) to fight against breast cancer; hence, the siRNA mediated E2F3 gene silencing knockdown the E2F3.  Conclusions:   This in vitro study demonstrates that E2F3 is a newly identified diagnostic and potential therapeutic target in breast cancer. Outcomes of this study affirm that siRNA for E2F3 facilitates the silencing of E2F3 overexpression and fights against breast cancer. Therefore, it plays a vital role as an alternative for diagnosis and clinical outcome for the treatment of breast cancer.""","""['Karuppaiya Vimala', 'Shenbagamoorthy Sundarraj', 'Mohanan V Sujitha', 'Soundarapandian Kannan']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Arch Med Res""","""['siRNA and targeted delivery systems in breast cancer therapy.', 'Nuclear overexpression of the E2F3 transcription factor in human lung cancer.', 'E2F3 is the main target gene of the 6p22 amplicon with high specificity for human bladder cancer.', 'A study of the suppressive effect on human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell proliferation and angiogenesis by stable plasmid-based siRNA silencing of c-Src gene expression.', 'Small interference RNAs directed against KDR gene inhibit the proliferation of breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo.', 'siRNA and targeted delivery systems in breast cancer therapy.', 'Identification of Candidate Genes Regulating Carcass Depth and Hind Leg Circumference in Simmental Beef Cattle Using Illumina Bovine Beadchip and Next-Generation Sequencing Analyses.', 'Circular RNA circ_0000644 promotes papillary thyroid cancer progression via sponging miR-1205 and regulating E2F3 expression.', 'Bioengineered siRNA-Based Nanoplatforms Targeting Molecular Signaling Pathways for the Treatment of Triple Negative Breast Cancer: Preclinical and Clinical Advancements.', 'Identification of Breast Cancer Subtype Specific MicroRNAs Using Survival Analysis to Find Their Role in Transcriptomic Regulation.']"""

The detection rates of SPCs after CUP can be considered as measures for the effectiveness of modern diagnostic techniques in finding tumors. We aimed to compare the rates of specific SPCs found after the work-up of CUP and the more sign/symptom-directed diagnostic approaches applied after any other cancer. The number of CUP patients identified in the nationwide Swedish database and nine German cancer registries was 24 641 from 1997 through 2006, and rate ratios (RRs) for SPCs were recorded in two follow-up periods. The detection rate of SPCs immediately after any other cancer was about two times higher in Germany than in Sweden, but the rate immediately after CUP was almost the same for the two datasets. In the joint analyses after CUP, the RRs of liver, lung, breast, and kidney cancers were higher than after any other cancer, whereas the RRs of prostate, urinary bladder, and connective tissue cancers as well as non-Hodgkin's lymphoma were not significantly different; the RR of cancers of upper aerodigestive tract was lower after CUP than after any other cancer. The joint data indicate that the work-up is efficient in detecting tumors in the thoracoabdominal organs that are screened by computed tomography. For some other organ sites, the more sign/symptom-directed diagnostic approaches may be equally efficient.

Materials and methods:   930 consecutive patients with suspected prostatic cancer were followed up after biopsy. Warfarin/low-dose aspirin was not stopped prior to the procedure. An eight to 10 sample regime TRUS-guided prostate biopsy was performed and patients were offered a questionnaire to complete 10 days after the procedure, to determine any immediate or delayed bleeding complications.  Results:   902 patients returned completed questionnaires. 579 (64.2%) underwent eight core biopsies, 47 (5.2%) underwent nine, and 276 (30.6%) underwent 10. 68 were taking warfarin [mean international normalized ratio (INR) = 2.5], 216 were taking low-dose aspirin, one was taking both, and 617 were taking neither. 27.9% of those on warfarin and 33.8% of those on aspirin experienced haematuria. 37% of those on no blood-thinning medication experienced haematuria. 13.2% of those on warfarin and 14.4% of those on aspirin experienced rectal bleeding. 11.5% of those on no blood-thinning medication experienced rectal bleeding. 7.4% of those on warfarin and 12% of those on aspirin experienced haematospermia. 13.8% of those on neither experienced haematospermia. Regression analysis showed a significant association between increasing sampling number and occurrence of all bleeding complication types. There was no significant association between minor bleeding complications and warfarin use; however, there was a significant association between minor bleeding complications and low-dose aspirin use. There was no severe bleeding complication.  Conclusion:   There is an increased risk of bleeding complications following TRUS-guided prostate biopsy with increased sampling numbers but these are minor. There is also an increased risk with low-dose aspirin use; however, there is no increased risk of bleeding complications with warfarin use.

Objective:   To describe the total hospitalization costs attributable to robotic and open surgery for radical prostatectomy (RP).  Design, setting, and participants:   Using a population-based cohort by merging the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) and the American Hospital Association (AHA) survey from 2006 to 2008, we identified 29 837 prostate cancer patients who underwent RP.  Interventions:   ORP and RARP.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The primary outcome was total hospitalization costs adjusted to year 2008 US dollars. Generalized estimating equations were used to identify patient and hospital characteristics associated with total hospitalization costs and to estimate costs of ORP and RARP adjusted for case mix and hospital teaching status, location, and annual case volume.  Results and limitations:   Overall, 20 424 (68.5%) patients were surgically treated with RARP, and 9413 (31.5%) patients underwent ORP.

In the US, linkage with state death records may not be sufficient to ascertain all deaths. Since 1979, all state vital statistics offices have reported their death certificate information to the National Death Index (NDI).  Objective:   This study was designed to measure the impact of linkage with the NDI on population-based relative and cancer cause-specific survival rates in the US.  Methods:   Central cancer registry records for patients diagnosed 1993-1995 from California, Colorado, and Idaho were linked with death certificate information (deaths 1993-2004) from their individual state vital statistics offices and with the NDI. Two databases were created: one contained incident records with deceased patients linked only to state death records and the second database contained incident records with deceased patients linked to both state death records and the NDI. Survival estimates and 95% confidence intervals from each database were compared by state and primary site category.  Results:   At 60 months follow-up, 42.1-48.1% of incident records linked with state death records and an additional 0.7-3.4% of records linked with the NDI.

Additional combinations of state and primary site had significant survival estimate differences, which differed by method (relative versus cause-specific survival).

However, the combined effect of age and comorbidities has not been assessed in patients with high-risk PCa who might have heterogeneous rates of competing mortality despite the presence of aggressive disease.  Objective:   To examine the risk of 10-yr cancer-specific mortality (CSM) and other-cause mortality (OCM) according to clinical and pathologic characteristics of patients treated with radical prostatectomy (RP) for high-risk PCa.  Design, setting, and participants:   Within a multi-institutional cohort, 3828 men treated with RP for high-risk PCa (defined as the presence of at least one of these risk factors: prostate-specific antigen >20 ng/ml, biopsy Gleason score 8-10, clinical stage ≥ T3) were identified.  Intervention:   All patients underwent RP and pelvic lymph node dissection.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Competing-risk Poisson regression analyses were performed to simultaneously assess the 10-yr CSM and OCM rates after RP. The same analyses were also conducted after stratification of patients according to age at surgery, comorbidity status assessed by the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), and number of risk factors (one vs two or more).  Results and limitations:   Overall, 229 patients (5.9%) died from PCa; 549 (14.3%) died from other causes. The 10-yr CSM and OCM rates ranged from 5.1% to 12.8% and from 4.3% to 37.4%, respectively. Age and CCI were the major determinants of OCM; their impact on CSM was minimal. OCM was the leading cause of death in all patient groups except in young men (≤ 59 yr) with no comorbidities, regardless of the number of risk factors (10-yr CSM and OCM 6.9-12.8% and 5.5-6.3%, respectively). The main limitation was the lack of patients managed conservatively.  Conclusions:   Even in the context of high-risk PCa, long-term CSM after RP is modest and represents the leading cause of death only in young, healthy patients. Conversely, older and sicker patients with multiple risk factors are at the highest risk of dying from OCM while sharing very low CSM rates.""","""['Alberto Briganti', 'Martin Spahn', 'Steven Joniau', 'Paolo Gontero', 'Marco Bianchi', 'Burkhard Kneitz', 'Felix K H Chun', 'Maxine Sun', 'Markus Graefen', 'Firas Abdollah', 'Giansilvio Marchioro', 'Detlef Frohenberg', 'Simone Giona', 'Bruno Frea', 'Pierre I Karakiewicz', 'Francesco Montorsi', 'Hein Van Poppel', 'R Jeffrey Karnes;European Multicenter Prostate Cancer Clinical and Translational Research Group (EMPaCT)']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Re: impact of age and comorbidities on long-term survival of patients with high-risk prostate cancer treated with radical prostatectomy: a multi-institutional competing-risks analysis.', 'Predicting prostate cancer-specific outcome after radical prostatectomy among men with very high-risk cT3b/4 PCa: a multi-institutional outcome study of 266 patients.', 'Very long-term survival patterns of young patients treated with radical prostatectomy for high-risk prostate cancer.', 'Selecting the optimal candidate for adjuvant radiotherapy after radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer: a long-term survival analysis.', 'Debulking surgery in the setting of very high-risk prostate cancer scenarios.', 'Anatomical extent of pelvic lymphadenectomy in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy.', 'Effect of Clinical Parameters on Risk of Death from Cancer after Radical Prostatectomy in Men with Localized and Locally Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'Comorbidity Prevalence and Impact on Quality of Life in Gay and Bisexual Men Following Prostate Cancer Treatment.', 'Impact of Grade Groups on Prostate Cancer-Specific and Other-Cause Mortality: Competing Risk Analysis from a Large Single Institution Series.', 'Stroma Transcriptomic and Proteomic Profile of Prostate Cancer Metastasis Xenograft Models Reveals Prognostic Value of Stroma Signatures.', 'Surgical management of high-risk, localized prostate cancer.']"""

This paper examines variations in the uptake of PSA testing across Europe and the role of individual and contextual variables in explaining this variation.  Methods:   Data were taken from Eurobarometer 66.2 ""Health in the European Union"" 2006 on self-reported uptake of screening. Data related to men across the EU-27 and Croatia, aged 40 and over (N=6986). A logistic regression analysis examines the role of individual characteristics across and within the countries.  Results:   A range of individual characteristics were found to be statistically significant predictors of uptake including education, marital status, and smoking status. Socio-economic status (SES) was also a statistically significant predictor of the likelihood of screening. Variation across countries in uptake was evident; importantly a significant role was accorded primary care in explaining variation in uptake.  Conclusion:   Uptake of PSA testing varies considerably within and across European countries. Differences within states relate to the characteristics of individuals offered tests and differences between states, to the system of primary care in operation. Given the significant welfare losses implicit in the evident variations the role of primary care warrants further investigation.""","""['Richeal Burns', 'Brendan Walsh', ""Stephen O'Neill"", ""Ciaran O'Neill""]""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Health Policy""","""['The importance of socio-economic variables in cancer screening participation: a comparison between population-based and opportunistic screening in the EU-15.', 'Prostate cancer screening practices in the Republic of Ireland: the determinants of uptake.', 'Breast, colon, and prostate screening in the adult population of Croatia: does rural origin matter?', 'Epilogue: different approaches for prostate cancer screening in the EU?', 'Detection of prostate cancer: the impact of the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC).', 'Health preferences and preventive care utilisation: How EQ-5D-5L health preferences may affect uptake.', 'Link between prostate cancer diagnosis and stroke in the United States during 2007-2017.', 'Factors Related to Prostate-Specific Antigen-Based Prostate Cancer Screening in Primary Care: Retrospective Cohort Study of 120,587 French Men Over the Age of 50 Years.', 'Perceived Physical Strain at Work and Incidence of Prostate Cancer – a Case-Control Study in Sweden and Finland.', 'The association between physician trust and prostate-specific antigen screening: Implications for shared decision-making.']"""

Recent evidence suggests that CXCL16, a novel chemokine, is overexpressed in inflammation-associated tumors and mediates pro-tumorigenic effects of inflammation in prostate cancer. We therefore analyzed the expression of CXCL12 and CXCL16 and their respective receptors CXCR4 and CXCR6 in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and cervical cancer and further assessed their association with clinicopathologic features and outcomes. Tissue chip technology and immunohistochemistry were used to analyze the expression of CXCL12, CXCR4, CXCL16, and CXCR6 in healthy cervical tissue (21 cases), CIN (65 cases), and cervical carcinoma (60 cases). The association of protein expression with clinicopathologic features and overall survival was analyzed. These four proteins were clearly detected in membrane and cytoplasm of neoplastic epithelial cells, and their distribution and intensity of expression increased as neoplastic lesions progressed through CIN1, CIN2, and CIN3 to invasive cancer. Furthermore, the expression of CXCR4 was associated significantly with the histologic grade of cervical carcinoma, whereas the expression of CXCR6 was associated significantly with lymph node metastasis. In Kaplan-Meier analysis, patients with high CXCR6 expression had significantly shorter overall survival than did those with low CXCR6 expression. The elevated co-expression levels of CXCL12/CXCR4 and CXCL16/CXCR6 in CIN and cervical carcinoma suggest a durative process in cervical carcinoma development.

Therefore, cancer preventive agents or molecular-targeting agents can inhibit the tumor growth at G(1) phase through RB reactivation. However, little is known about the effectiveness of RB reactivating agents against malignancies with mutated RB. We report here that chemopreventive agent flavone, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor LY294002, and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) also induce G(1) phase arrest in malignant tumor cells with mutated RB. In human prostate cancer DU145 cells with mutated RB, flavone increased cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors p21 and p27, and reduced cdk4 and cdk6, resulting in decrement of phosphorylated RB family proteins p130 and p107. LY294002 also dephosphorylated p107 and p130 proteins, whereas TSA dephosphorylated p130, but not p107. Furthermore, flavone induced G(1) phase arrest in both mouse embryo fibroblast (MEF) wild-type and MEF RB(-/-) cells, but did not do so in RB, p107, and p130 triple-knockout MEF cells. These results suggested that p130 and p107 contributed to G(1) phase arrest by flavone in RB-mutated cells. However, flavone induced tumor suppressor microRNA miR-34a with reduction of E2F1 and E2F3, known to be downregulated by miR-34a, raising the possibility that miR-34a might partially contribute to G(1) arrest by flavone.

Implanted gold markers have been used with great effect for positioning the target volume by a fluoroscopy, especially for the cases of liver and prostate with the targets surrounded by water-equivalent tissues. However, recent studies have revealed that gold markers can cause a significant underdose in proton therapy. This paper focuses on prostate cancer and explores the possibility that multiple-field irradiation improves the underdose effect by markers on tumor-control probability (TCP).  Methods:   A Monte Carlo simulation was performed to evaluate the dose distortion effect. A spherical gold marker was placed at several characteristic points in a water phantom. The markers were with two different diameters of 2 and 1.5 mm, both visible on fluoroscopy. Three beam arrangements of single-field uniform dose (SFUD) were examined: one lateral field, two opposite lateral fields, and three fields (two opposite lateral fields + anterior field). The relative biological effectiveness (RBE) was set to 1.1 and a dose of 74 Gy (RBE) was delivered to the target of a typical prostate size in 37 fractions. The ratios of TCP to that without the marker (TCP(r)) were compared with the parameters of the marker sizes, number of fields, and marker positions. To take into account the dependence of biological parameters in TCP model, α∕β values of 1.5, 3, and 10 Gy (RBE) were considered.  Results:   It was found that the marker of 1.5 mm diameter does not affect the TCPs with all α∕β values when two or more fields are used. On the other hand, if the marker diameter is 2 mm, more than two irradiation fields are required to suppress the decrease in TCP from TCP(r) by less than 3%. This is especially true when multiple (two or three) markers are used for alignment of a patient.  Conclusions:   It is recommended that 1.5-mm markers be used to avoid the reduction of TCP as well as to spare the surrounding critical organs, as long as the markers are visible on x-ray fluoroscopy. When 2-mm markers are implanted, more than two fields should be used and the markers should not be placed close to the distal edge of any of the beams.""","""['Taeko Matsuura', 'Kenichiro Maeda', 'Kenneth Sutherland', 'Taisuke Takayanagi', 'Shinichi Shimizu', 'Seishin Takao', 'Naoki Miyamoto', 'Hideaki Nihongi', 'Chie Toramatsu', 'Yoshihiko Nagamine', 'Rintaro Fujimoto', 'Ryusuke Suzuki', 'Masayori Ishikawa', 'Kikuo Umegaki', 'Hiroki Shirato']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['MO-F-213AB-04: Biological Effect of Dose Shadowing by Fiducial Markers in Spot Scanning Proton Therapy with a Limited Number of Fields.', 'Preclinical investigation for developing injectable fiducial markers using a mixture of BaSO4 and biodegradable polymer for proton therapy.', 'Monte Carlo simulations of the dosimetric impact of radiopaque fiducial markers for proton radiotherapy of the prostate.', 'Investigation of the dosimetric impact of a Ni-Ti fiducial marker in carbon ion and proton beams.', 'Science and ethics of proton therapy.', 'Proton therapy in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'Are simple verbal instructions sufficient to ensure that bladder volume does not deteriorate prostate position reproducibility during spot scanning proton therapy?', 'Experimental Comparison of Fiducial Markers Used in Proton Therapy: Study of Different Imaging Modalities and Proton Fluence Perturbations Measured With CMOS Pixel Sensors.', 'A treatment planning study of urethra-sparing intensity-modulated proton therapy for localized prostate cancer.', 'Carbon ion radiotherapy using fiducial markers for prostate cancer in Osaka HIMAK: Treatment planning.']"""

The elemental composition of cancerous tissues frequently differs from healthy tissue of the same organ, particularly in high-Z trace element concentrations. For this reason, one could suggest that this may be exploited in diagnostics and perhaps even influence dosimetry.  Methods:   In this work, for the first time, effective atomic numbers are computed for common cancerous and healthy tissues using a robust, energy-dependent approach between 10 keV and 100 MeV. These are then quantitatively compared within the context of diagnostics and dosimetry.  Results:   Differences between effective atomic numbers of healthy and diseased tissues are found to be typically less than 10%. Fibrotic tissues and calcifications of the breast exhibit substantial (tens to hundreds of percent) differences to healthy tissue. Expectedly, differences are most pronounced in the photoelectric regime and consequently most relevant for kV imaging∕therapy and radionuclides with prominent low-energy peaks. Cancerous tissue of the testes and stomach have lower effective atomic numbers than corresponding healthy tissues, while diseased tissues of the other organ sites typically have higher values.  Conclusions:   As dose calculation approaches improve in accuracy, there may be an argument for the explicit inclusion of pathologies. This is more the case for breast, penile, prostate, nasopharyngeal, and stomach cancer, less so for testicular and kidney cancer. The calculated data suggest dual-energy computed tomography could potentially improve lesion identification in the aforementioned organs (with the exception of testicular cancer), with most import in breast imaging. Ultimately, however, the differences are very small. It is likely that the assumption of a generic ""tissue ramp"" in planning will be sufficient for the foreseeable future, and that the Z differences do not notably aid lesion detection beyond that already facilitated by differences in mass density.""","""['M L Taylor']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Sensitivity of low energy brachytherapy Monte Carlo dose calculations to uncertainties in human tissue composition.', 'Influence of trace elements in human tissue in low-energy photon brachytherapy dosimetry.', 'Breast cancer detection using neutron stimulated emission computed tomography: prominent elements and dose requirements.', 'Monte Carlo study of LDR seed dosimetry with an application in a clinical brachytherapy breast implant.', 'Dual-energy CT-based material extraction for tissue segmentation in Monte Carlo dose calculations.', 'Quantitative parameters in novel spectral computed tomography: Assessment of Ki-67 expression in patients with gastric adenocarcinoma.', 'Utility of dual-layer spectral-detector CT imaging for predicting pathological tumor stages and histologic grades of colorectal adenocarcinoma.']"""

The choice of imaging frequency and timing are key components in delivering the desired dose while reducing associated overhead such as imaging dose, preparation, and processing time. In this project the authors propose a paradigm with imaging timing and frequency based on the spatial and temporal dose patterns of the treatment plan.  Methods:   A number of control points are used in treatment planning to model VMAT delivery. For each control point, the sensitivity of individual target or organ-at-risk dose to motion can be calculated as the summation of dose degradations given the organ displacements along a number of possible motion directions. Instead of acquiring radiographs at uniform time intervals, MV∕KV image pairs are acquired indexed to motion sensitivity. Five prostate patients treated via hypofractionated VMAT are included in this study. Intrafractional prostate motion traces from the database of an electromagnetic tracking system are used to retrospectively simulate the VMAT delivery and motion management. During VMAT delivery simulation patient position is corrected based on the radiographic findings via couch movement if target deviation violates a patient-specific 3D threshold. The violation rate calculated as the percentage of traces failing the clinical dose objectives after motion correction is used to evaluate the efficacy of this approach.  Results:   Imaging indexed to a 10 s equitime interval and correcting patient position accordingly reduces the violation rate to 19.5% with intervention from 44.5% without intervention. Imaging indexed to the motion sensitivity further reduces the violation rate to 12.1% with the same number of images. To achieve the same 5% violation rate, the imaging incidence can be reduced by 40% by imaging indexed to motion sensitivity instead of time.  Conclusions:   The simulation results suggest that image scheduling according to the characteristics of the treatment plan can improve the efficiency of intrafractional motion management. Using such a technique, the accuracy of delivered dose during image-guided hypofractionated VMAT treatment can be improved.""","""['Pengpeng Zhang', 'Margie Hunt', 'Laura Happersett', 'Brett Cox', 'Gig Mageras']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Optimizing fiducial visibility on periodically acquired megavoltage and kilovoltage image pairs during prostate volumetric modulated arc therapy.', 'Determination of action thresholds for electromagnetic tracking system-guided hypofractionated prostate radiotherapy using volumetric modulated arc therapy.', 'Accuracy of real-time couch tracking during 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy, intensity modulated radiation therapy, and volumetric modulated arc therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Adaptive optimization by 6 DOF robotic couch in prostate volumetric IMRT treatment: rototranslational shift and dosimetric consequences.', 'Target motion management in breast cancer radiation therapy.', 'Optimizing fiducial visibility on periodically acquired megavoltage and kilovoltage image pairs during prostate volumetric modulated arc therapy.', 'Simultaneous MV-kV imaging for intrafractional motion management during volumetric-modulated arc therapy delivery.', 'Intrafractional 3D localization using kilovoltage digital tomosynthesis for sliding-window intensity modulated radiation therapy.']"""

However, the clinical and pathological significance of MMP-10 in human prostate cancer tissues remains unclear. This study aimed to clarify the role of MMP-10 in non-metastatic prostate cancer. Sixty-three specimens were obtained by radical prostatectomy. MMP-10 expression, Ki-67, CD34 and apoptotic cells were examined using an immunohistochemical technique and the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick end-labeling method. The proliferation index (PI), apoptotic index (AI), microvessel density (MVD) and cell renewal index (CRI=PI/AI) were calculated. The relationship between MMP-10 expression and clinicopathological features, as well as PI, AI, MVD and CRI were investigated. MMP-10 was mainly detected in cancer cell cytoplasm, and the proportion of MMP-10-expressing cancer cells (median 13.8%) was significantly higher (P<0.001) than non-tumoral gland cells (2.4%). Similarly, the proportion of MMP-10-expressing cancer cells was significantly higher (P=0.007) in stage pT3 (median 22.3%) than in pT2 (11.3%) tumors and was correlated with blood vessel invasion (P=0.025).

The combination of docetaxel and cetuximab, the monoclonal antibody against EGFR, has not been tested in patients with prostate cancer.  Experimental design:   Patients with mCRPC progressing during or within 90 days after at least 12 weeks of docetaxel were included in this phase II trial. Treatment consisted of docetaxel (75 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks or 35 mg/m(2) on days 1, 8, 15 every 4 weeks) in combination with cetuximab (400 mg/m(2) on day 1 and then 250 mg/m(2) weekly). The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) at 12 weeks defined as the absence of prostate-specific antigen (PSA), radiographic, or clinical progression. Evaluation of known biomarkers of response and resistance to cetuximab (EGFR, PTEN, amphiregulin, epiregulin) was conducted.  Results:   Thirty-eight patients were enrolled at 15 Swiss centers. Median age was 68 years and median PSA was 212 ng/mL. PFS at 12 weeks was 34% [95% confidence interval (CI), 19%-52%], PFS at 24 weeks was 20%, and median overall survival (OS) was 13.3 months (95% CI, 7.3-15.4). Seven patients (20%) had a confirmed ≥ 50% and 11 patients (31%) a confirmed ≥ 30% PSA decline. About 47% of enrolled patients experienced grade 3 and 8% grade 4 toxicities. A significantly improved PFS was found in patients with overexpression of EGFR and persistent activity of PTEN.

The roots of P. zeylanica have been used in Indian and Chinese systems of medicine for more than 2500 years for the treatment of various types of ailments.

PL treatment (2 mg/kg body weight i.p. in 0.2 ml phosphate-buffered saline, 5 days a week) to FVB-TRAMP resulted in a significant (P < 0.01) decrease in prostate tumor size and urogenital apparatus weights at 13 and 20 weeks. Histopathological analysis revealed that PL treatment inhibited progression of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) to poorly differentiated carcinoma (PDC). No animal exhibited diffuse tumor formation in PL-treated group at 13 weeks, whereas 75% of the vehicle-treated mice elicited diffuse PIN and large PDC at this stage. At 20 weeks, 25% of the PL-treated animals demonstrated diffuse PIN and 75% developed small PDC, whereas 100% of the vehicle-treated mice showed large PDC. PL treatment inhibited expression of protein kinase C epsilon (PKCε), signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 phosphorylation, proliferating cell nuclear antigen and neuroendocrine markers (synaptophysin and chromogranin-A) in excised prostate tumor tissues.

In addition to aberrant DNA methylation of single genes, another manifestation of epigenetic dysfunction in cancer is agglomerative DNA methylation, which can participate in long-range epigenetic silencing that targets many neighboring genes and has been shown to occur in several types of clinical cancers. Using in vitro model systems of toxicant-induced malignant transformation, we found hundreds of aberrant DNA methylation events that emerge during malignant transformation, some of which occur in an agglomerative fashion. In an arsenite-transformed prostate epithelial cell line, the protocadherin (PCDH), HOXC and HOXD gene family clusters are targeted for agglomerative DNA methylation. The agglomerative DNA methylation changes induced by arsenicals appear to be common and clinically relevant events, since they occur in other human cancer cell lines and models of malignant transformation, as well as clinical cancer specimens. Aberrant DNA methylation in general occurred more often within histone H3 lysine-27 trimethylation stem cell domains. We found a striking association between enrichment of histone H3 lysine-9 trimethylation stem cell domains and toxicant-induced agglomerative DNA methylation, suggesting these epigenetic modifications may become aberrantly linked during malignant transformation. In summary, we found an association between toxicant-induced malignant transformation and agglomerative DNA methylation, which lends further support to the hypothesis that epigenetic dysfunction plays an important role in toxicant-induced malignant transformation.""","""['Paul L Severson', 'Erik J Tokar', 'Lukas Vrba', 'Michael P Waalkes', 'Bernard W Futscher']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Epigenetics""","""['Coordinate H3K9 and DNA methylation silencing of ZNFs in toxicant-induced malignant transformation.', 'Oxidative stress-induced epigenetic changes associated with malignant transformation of human kidney epithelial cells.', 'Mapping dynamic histone modification patterns during arsenic-induced malignant transformation of human bladder cells.', 'Gene methylation in gastric cancer.', 'Epigenetic interplays between DNA demethylation and histone methylation for protecting oncogenesis.', 'Environmental exposures, stem cells, and cancer.', 'Arsenite malignantly transforms human prostate epithelial cells in vitro by gene amplification of mutated KRAS.', 'A Tox21 Approach to Altered Epigenetic Landscapes: Assessing Epigenetic Toxicity Pathways Leading to Altered Gene Expression and Oncogenic Transformation In Vitro.', 'Maternal cadmium, placental PCDHAC1, and fetal development.', 'The γ-Protocadherin-C3 isoform inhibits canonical Wnt signalling by binding to and stabilizing Axin1 at the membrane.']"""

The structures of the KDN-containing free oligosaccharides were analyzed by a variety of methods. Specifically, we used fluorescent labeling with aminopyridine combined with two-dimensional mapping, KDNase digestion and mass spectrometry to facilitate identification. The analysis also utilized newly synthesized KDN-linked oligosaccharides as standards. The prostate-specific glycans were composed of five species having the following sequence, KDN-Gal-GlcNAc-Man-Man-GlcNAc (α2,6-KDN-linked glycans being the dominant form).

Here, we propose a simple decision analytic solution in which sensitivity and specificity are weighted by an intuitive parameter, the threshold probability of disease at which a patient will opt for treatment. This gives a net benefit that can be used to determine which of two diagnostic tests will give better clinical results at a given threshold probability and whether either is superior to the strategy of assuming that all or no patients have disease. We derive a simple formula for the relative diagnostic value, which is the difference in sensitivities of two tests divided by the difference in the specificities. We show that multiplying relative diagnostic value by the odds at the prevalence gives the odds of the threshold probability below which the more sensitive test is preferable and above which the more specific test should be chosen.

In this paper, we report on the first use of KIM in a prospective clinical study of prostate cancer patients undergoing intensity modulated arc therapy (IMAT).  Methods and materials:   Ten prostate cancer patients with implanted fiducial markers undergoing conventionally fractionated IMAT (RapidArc) were enrolled in an ethics-approved study of KIM. KIM involves acquiring kV images as the gantry rotates around the patient during treatment. Post-treatment, markers in these images were segmented to obtain 2D positions. From the 2D positions, a maximum likelihood estimation of a probability density function was used to obtain 3D prostate trajectories. The trajectories were analyzed to determine the motion type and the percentage of time the prostate was displaced ≥ 3, 5, 7, and 10 mm. Independent verification of KIM positional accuracy was performed using kV/MV triangulation.  Results:   KIM was performed for 268 fractions. Various prostate trajectories were observed (ie, continuous target drift, transient excursion, stable target position, persistent excursion, high-frequency excursions, and erratic behavior). For all patients, 3D displacements of ≥ 3, 5, 7, and 10 mm were observed 5.6%, 2.2%, 0.7% and 0.4% of the time, respectively. The average systematic accuracy of KIM was measured at 0.46 mm.  Conclusions:   KIM for prostate IMAT was successfully implemented clinically for the first time. Key advantages of this method are (1) submillimeter accuracy, (2) widespread applicability, and (3) a low barrier to clinical implementation. A disadvantage is that KIM delivers additional imaging dose to the patient.""","""['Jin Aun Ng', 'Jeremy T Booth', 'Per R Poulsen', 'Walther Fledelius', 'Esben Schjødt Worm', 'Thomas Eade', 'Fiona Hegi', 'Andrew Kneebone', 'Zdenka Kuncic', 'Paul J Keall']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Real-Time 3D Image Guidance Using a Standard LINAC: Measured Motion, Accuracy, and Precision of the First Prospective Clinical Trial of Kilovoltage Intrafraction Monitoring-Guided Gating for Prostate Cancer Radiation Therapy.', 'The first clinical treatment with kilovoltage intrafraction monitoring (KIM): a real-time image guidance method.', 'The first clinical implementation of a real-time six degree of freedom target tracking system during radiation therapy based on Kilovoltage Intrafraction Monitoring (KIM).', 'Quality assurance for the clinical implementation of kilovoltage intrafraction monitoring for prostate cancer VMAT.', 'Dynamic targeting image-guided radiotherapy.', 'Assessment of intrafraction motion and its dosimetric impact on prostate radiotherapy using an in-house developed position monitoring system.', 'Virtual HDR Boost for Prostate Cancer: Rebooting a Classic Treatment Using Modern Tech.', 'Assessment of delivered dose in prostate cancer patients treated with ultra-hypofractionated radiotherapy on 1.5-Tesla MR-Linac.', 'Clinical validation of the Varian Truebeam intra-fraction motion review (IMR) system for prostate treatment guidance.', 'The dosimetric error due to uncorrected tumor rotation during real-time adaptive prostate stereotactic body radiation therapy.']"""

Methods and materials:   A prospective study of 130 patients who underwent external radiation therapy (RT) for stage T1 to T4 prostate cancer between 1997 and 2008 was performed. Treatments were conventional (2-dimensional [2D]) in 61 patients and 3D conformal in 69, with a median target dose of 72 Gy (70-74 Gy). Within 1 week after RT, proctoscopy was performed to detect possible acute endoscopic proctitis (AEP). Acute clinical proctitis (ACP) and late clinical proctitis (LCP) were also evaluated. The median follow-up was 84 months (20-180 months). The influence of AEP and ACP on LCP occurrence was studied using the Cox model controlling for age, dose, prostatectomy, RT technique (2D vs 3D), and hormone therapy.  Results:   AEP was detected in 15 patients (11.5%) and ACP in 67 (51.5%); in 13 cases (10%) AEP and ACP occurred simultaneously. Thirty-five cases of LCP were recorded. The 5-year probability of developing LCP was highest in patients with AEP and ACP (77%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 53%-94%) and lowest in asymptomatic patients (14%, 95% CI 7%-26%; P<.001). Compared to asymptomatic patients, the 5-year probability also was slightly increased in patients with ACP only (26%, 95% CI 16%-40%; P=.052). In multivariable analysis, the combination of AEP and ACP was the main predictor of LCP: compared to asymptomatic patients, the hazard ratio was 5.6 (2.1-15.2) in patients with AEP plus ACP (P=.001) and 2.1 (0.9-4.9) in those with ACP only (P=.103).  Conclusions:   In patients with AEP and ACP, the risk of LCP was more than 5-fold increased compared to those who were asymptomatic, while a much smaller increase in risk occurred in patients with ACP only.

While many correction strategies correct for translations only, advanced correction protocols also require knowledge of the rotation of the prostate. For this purpose, typically, three or more markers are implanted. Elongated fiducial markers provide more information about their orientation than traditional round or cylindrical markers. Potentially, fewer markers are required. In this study, we evaluate the effect of the number of elongated markers on the localization accuracy of the prostate. To quantify the localization error, we developed a model that estimates, at arbitrary locations in the prostate, the registration error caused by translational and rotational uncertainties of the marker registration. Every combination of one, two and three markers was analysed for a group of 24 patients. The average registration errors at the prostate surface were 0.3-0.8 mm and 0.4-1 mm for registrations on, respectively, three markers and two markers located on different sides of the prostate. Substantial registration errors (2.0-2.2 mm) occurred at the prostate surface contralateral to the markers when two markers were implanted on the same side of the prostate or only one marker was used.

In addition, implant dosimetry trends over this period have been investigated and results are presented. Iodine-125 seeds (Oncura model 6711) have been used since LDR prostate treatments began, with an aim to deliver a prostate dose of 145 Gy. Three key changes in implant technique took place during the period Sept 2004 to Sept 2011. The live implant dosimetry trends of the prostate D90, urethra V150, and rectum D0.1cc and D2.0cc, were assessed to see if the change in technique had an impact on the treatment planning and seed deployment. The switch from manual loading of seeds to pre-loaded needles and the change from a two-step pre-planning procedure to live planning have realized the greatest time savings with approximately 1.0 FTE physicist day saved per 2 patient implant day and 2 patient visits saved per treatment. Dosimetric parameters also improved with mean implant D90s rising from 166 Gy to 180 Gy. The average Urethra D10 also increased over the study group, rising from 186 Gy to 199 Gy while the rectum dose remained unchanged.

Denosumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits RANK Ligand (RANKL), is a novel bone-targeted agent with a distinct mechanism of action relative to the bisphosphonate zoledronic acid, for prevention of SRE. This pre-planned analysis evaluates the efficacy and safety of denosumab versus zoledronic acid across three pivotal studies.  Methods:   Patient-level data from three identically designed, randomised, double-blind, active-controlled, phase 3 trials of patients with breast cancer, prostate cancer, other solid tumours or multiple myeloma were combined.

In both DU-145 and PC-3 prostate cancer cell lines, Kaiso inhibition (short hairpin RNA-Kaiso) decreased cell migration and invasion even in the presence of EGF. Further, Kaiso directly binds to the E-cadherin promoter, and inhibition of Kaiso in PC-3 cells results in increased E-cadherin expression, as well as re-establishment of cell-cell contacts.

Previous data from clinically localized prostate cancer (PCa) series treated with radical prostatectomy (RP) have suggested that low preoperative serum total testosterone level is associated with more aggressive PCa; however, the definition of low preoperative total testosterone level varied among these studies (from 220 ng/dL to 387 ng/dL). Moreover, no relevant data exist in the literature regarding ethnic Chinese patients. The study shows that the most widely used threshold for low pretreatment total testosterone level (total testosterone < 300 ng/dL) is not appropriate for ethnic Chinese patients, because it could not distinguish patients with more aggressive PCa from those with less aggressive disease. Setting the threshold at the level of total testosterone < 250 ng/dL works better, because pretreatment total testosterone < 250 ng/dL is associated with a significantly higher incidence of Gleason score 8-10 disease in RP specimens.  Objective:   • To investigate the relationship between preoperative serum total testosterone level and prognostic factors of Chinese patients with clinically localized prostate cancer (PCa).  Patients and methods:   • A total of 110 patients with localized PCa, treated by radical prostatectomy (RP), were included in this prospective study. • Clinical and pathological data from each patient were collected. Total testosterone was measured on the morning of surgery. • Total testosterone levels for each patient were compared using two thresholds: threshold 1 (total testosterone <300 ng/dL vs total testosterone ≥ 300 ng/dL) and threshold 2 (total testosterone <250 ng/dL vs total testosterone ≥ 250 ng/dL).  Results:   • The median preoperative total testosterone level was 346 ng/dL. Gleason scores of ≤ 6, 7 and ≥ 8 were found in the RP specimens from 21 (19.1%), 67 (60.9%) and 22 (20.0%) patients, respectively. • Compared with those with low grade disease, patients with high grade disease (Gleason score ≥ 8) in RP specimens had a significantly lower preoperative total testosterone. • When comparing 35 patients with hypogonadism with 75 patients with eugonadism, classified by threshold 1, no significant relationships were found. • When comparing 18 patients with hypogonadism with 92 patients with eugonadism, classified by threshold 2, pathological Gleason score ≥ 8 tumours were more common in patients with hypogonadism.  Conclusion:   • Setting the threshold for hypogonadism at the level of pretreatment serum total testosterone <250 ng/dL is appropriate for ethnic Chinese patients with localized PCa, because patients with pretreatment total testosterone <250 ng/dL are associated with a higher incidence of Gleason score 8-10 disease in RP specimens.""","""['Bo Dai', 'YuanYuan Qu', 'YunYi Kong', 'DingWei Ye', 'XuDong Yao', 'ShiLin Zhang', 'ChaoFu Wang', 'HaiLiang Zhang', 'WeiYi Yang']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Low serum testosterone levels are associated with positive surgical margins in radical retropubic prostatectomy: hypogonadism represents bad prognosis in prostate cancer.', 'Study of testosterone as a predictor of tumor aggressiveness in patients with prostate cancer.', 'Preoperative serum testosterone level as an independent predictor of treatment failure following radical prostatectomy.', 'A new era of testosterone and prostate cancer: from physiology to clinical implications.', 'Recurrence of prostate cancer in patients receiving testosterone supplementation for hypogonadism.', 'Serum testosterone and prostate cancer in men with germline BRCA1/2 pathogenic variants.', 'Low serum total testosterone level as a predictor of upgrading in low-risk prostate cancer patients after radical prostatectomy: A systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels prior to prostatectomy are not related to long-term oncologic or cardiovascular outcomes for men with prostate cancer.', 'Low endogenous testosterone levels are associated with the extend of lymphnodal invasion at radical prostatectomy and extended pelvic lymph node dissection.', 'Basal total testosterone serum levels predict biopsy and pathological ISUP grade group in a large cohort of Caucasian prostate cancer patients who underwent radical prostatectomy.']"""

Mechanisms by which statins induce apoptosis in cancer cells are not clear. We previously showed that simvastatin inhibit prostate cancer cell functions and tumor growth. Molecular mechanisms by which simvastatin induce apoptosis in prostate cancer cells is not completely understood.  Methods:   Effect of simvastatin on PC3 cell apoptosis was compared with docetaxel using apoptosis, TUNEL and trypan blue viability assays. Protein expression of major candidates of the intrinsic pathway downstream of simvastatin-mediated Akt inactivation was analyzed. Gene arrays and western analysis of PC3 cells and tumor lysates were performed to identify the candidate genes mediating extrinsic apoptosis pathway by simvastatin.  Results:   Data indicated that simvastatin inhibited intrinsic cell survival pathway in PC3 cells by enhancing phosphorylation of Bad, reducing the protein expression of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and cleaved caspases 9/3. Over-expression of PC3 cells with Bcl-2 or DN-caspase 9 did not rescue the simvastatin-induced apoptosis. Simvastatin treatment resulted in increased mRNA and protein expression of molecules such as TNF, Fas-L, Traf1 and cleaved caspase 8, major mediators of intrinsic apoptosis pathway and reduced protein levels of pro-survival genes Lhx4 and Nme5.  Conclusions:   Our study provides the first report that simvastatin simultaneously modulates intrinsic and extrinsic pathways in the regulation of prostate cancer cell apoptosis in vitro and in vivo, and render reasonable optimism that statins could become an attractive anti-cancer agent.""","""['Anna Goc', 'Samith T Kochuparambil', 'Belal Al-Husein', 'Ahmad Al-Azayzih', 'Shuaib Mohammad', 'Payaningal R Somanath']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Piperine Inhibits Cell Proliferation and Induces Apoptosis of Human Gastric Cancer Cells by Downregulating Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase (PI3K)/Akt Pathway.', 'Bcl-2 family inhibition sensitizes human prostate cancer cells to docetaxel and promotes unexpected apoptosis under caspase-9 inhibition.', 'R115777 (Zarnestra)/Zoledronic acid (Zometa) cooperation on inhibition of prostate cancer proliferation is paralleled by Erk/Akt inactivation and reduced Bcl-2 and bad phosphorylation.', 'Caspase control: protagonists of cancer cell apoptosis.', 'Evasion of cell death: A contributory factor in prostate cancer development and treatment resistance.', 'Investigating potential anti-proliferative activity of different statins against five cancer cell lines.', 'Regulation of Kinase Signaling Pathways by α6β4-Integrins and Plectin in Prostate Cancer.', 'The Link Between Statins and Breast Cancer in Mouse Models: A Systematic Review.', 'Effect of concomitant use of pitavastatin with neoadjuvant chemotherapy protocols in breast cancer patients: A randomized controlled clinical trial.', 'Statins Alleviate Tumor Hypoxia in Prostate Cancer Models by Decreasing Oxygen Consumption: An Opportunity for Radiosensitization?']"""

Methods:   We assessed three health-related quality-of-life domains (measured with the Health Survey Short Form-36: Physical Functioning, Mental Health, and Vitality scales) via questionnaires completed by PCPT participants at enrollment (3 months before randomization), at 6 months after randomization, and annually for 7 years. Covariate data obtained at enrollment from patient-completed questionnaires were included in our model. Mixed-effects model analyses and a cross-sectional presentation at three time points began at 6 months after randomization. All statistical tests were two-sided.  Results:   For the physical function outcome (n = 16 077), neither the finasteride main effect nor the finasteride interaction with time were statistically significant.

In this study we investigated the predictive capacity of 32 GWAS-detected common variants for breast cancer risk, alone and in combination with classical risk factors, and for tumours with different hormone receptor status.  Material and methods:   Within the Breast and Prostate Cancer Cohort Consortium, we analysed 6009 invasive breast cancer cases and 7827 matched controls of European ancestry, with data on classical breast cancer risk factors and 32 common gene variants identified through GWAS. Discriminatory ability with respect to breast cancer of specific hormone receptor-status was assessed with the age adjusted and cohort-adjusted concordance statistic (AUROC(a)). Absolute risk scores were calculated with external reference data. Integrated discrimination improvement was used to measure improvements in risk prediction.  Results:   We found a small but steady increase in discriminatory ability with increasing numbers of genetic variants included in the model (difference in AUROC(a) going from 2.7% to 4%). Discriminatory ability for all models varied strongly by hormone receptor status.

In many cases, the TRUS probes are moved manually or mechanically to acquire volumetric information, making the imaging slow, user dependent, and unreliable. A real-time three-dimensional (3-D) TRUS system could improve reliability and volume rates of imaging during these procedures. In this article, the authors present a 5-MHz cylindrical dual-layer transducer array capable of real-time 3-D transrectal ultrasound without any mechanically moving parts. Compared with fully sampled 2-D arrays, this design substantially reduces the channel count and fabrication complexity. This dual-layer transducer uses PZT elements for transmit and P[VDF-TrFE] copolymer elements for receive, respectively. The mechanical flexibility of both diced PZT and copolymer makes it practical for transrectal applications. Full synthetic aperture 3-D data sets were acquired by interfacing the transducer with a Verasonics Data Acquisition System. Offline 3-D beamforming was then performed to obtain volumes of two wire phantoms and a cyst phantom. Generalized coherence factor was applied to improve the contrast of images. The measured -6-dB fractional bandwidth of the transducer was 62% with a center frequency of 5.66 MHz.

Results:   Grade 3 genitourinary complication was observed in 8.8 % of HDR brachytherapy group and 44 % in EBRT alone group. Five-year urinary incontinence rate was 2.9 % in HDR brachytherapy and 24 % in EBRT alone group. The results showed that significant higher incidence of grade 3 genitourinary complication (p = 0.003) and urinary incontinence was the most significant (p = 0.023) in the EBRT alone group.

LNCaP tumors were established in nude mice and infected with this CRAd to study tumor viral spread, NIS expression, and efficacy. Using quantitative PCR, we found a linear correlation between the viral dose and viral genome copy numbers recovered after tumor infection. Confocal microscopy showed a linear correlation between adenovirus density and NIS expression. Radioiodide uptake vs virus dose-response curves revealed that the dose response curve was not linear and displayed a lower threshold of detection at 10(7) vp (virus particles) and an upper plateau of uptake at 10(11) vp. The outcome of radiovirotherapy was highly dependent upon viral dose. At 10(10) vp, no significant differences were observed between virotherapy alone or radiovirotherapy. However, when radioiodide therapy was combined with virotherapy at a dose of 10(11) vp, significant improvement in survival was observed, indicating a relationship between viral dose-response uptake and the efficacy of radiovirotherapy.

Once established in bone, tumors are responsible for significant morbidity and mortality. Thus, there is a significant need to understand the molecular mechanisms controlling the establishment, growth and activity of tumors in bone. Several in vivo models have been established to study these events and each has specific benefits and limitations. The most commonly used model utilizes intracardiac inoculation of tumor cells directly into the arterial blood supply of athymic (nude) BalbC mice. This procedure can be applied to many different tumor types (including PC-3 prostate cancer, lung carcinoma, and mouse mammary fat pad tumors); however, in this manuscript we will focus on the breast cancer model, MDA-MB-231. In this model we utilize a highly bone-selective clone, originally derived in Dr. Mundy's group in San Antonio, that has since been transfected for GFP expression and re-cloned by our group. This clone is a bone metastatic variant with a high rate of osteotropism and very little metastasis to lung, liver, or adrenal glands. While intracardiac injections are most commonly used for studies of bone metastasis, in certain instances intratibial or mammary fat pad injections are more appropriate. Intracardiac injections are typically performed when using human tumor cells with the goal of monitoring later stages of metastasis, specifically the ability of cancer cells to arrest in bone, survive, proliferate, and establish tumors that develop into cancer-induced bone disease. Intratibial injections are performed if focusing on the relationship of cancer cells and bone after a tumor has metastasized to bone, which correlates roughly to established metastatic bone disease. Neither of these models recapitulates early steps in the metastatic process prior to embolism and entry of tumor cells into the circulation. If monitoring primary tumor growth or metastasis from the primary site to bone, then mammary fat pad inoculations are usually preferred; however, very few tumor cell lines will consistently metastasize to bone from the primary site, with 4T1 bone-preferential clones, a mouse mammary carcinoma, being the exception. This manuscript details inoculation procedures and highlights key steps in post inoculation analyses. Specifically, it includes cell culture, tumor cell inoculation procedures for intracardiac and intratibial inoculations, as well as brief information regarding weekly monitoring by x-ray, fluorescence and histomorphometric analyses.""","""['J Preston Campbell', 'Alyssa R Merkel', 'S Kathryn Masood-Campbell', 'Florent Elefteriou', 'Julie A Sterling']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""J Vis Exp""","""['Human tissue-specific microenvironment: an essential requirement for mouse models of breast cancer.', 'The effect of the bisphosphonate ibandronate on breast cancer metastasis to visceral organs.', 'A bone-seeking clone exhibits different biological properties from the MDA-MB-231 parental human breast cancer cells and a brain-seeking clone in vivo and in vitro.', 'Animal models of bone metastasis.', 'Parathyroid hormone-related protein and bone metastases.', 'Anti‑metastatic activity of aromatic aminomethylidenebisphosphonates in a mouse model of 4T1 cell‑derived breast cancer.', 'Bone Lesion-Derived Extracellular Vesicles Fuel Prometastatic Cascades in Hepatocellular Carcinoma by Transferring ALKBH5-Targeting miR-3190-5p.', 'RNF2 inhibits E-Cadherin transcription to promote hepatocellular carcinoma metastasis via inducing histone mono-ubiquitination.', 'Protocol to generate murine organotypic brain cultures for drug screening and evaluation of\xa0anti-metastatic efficacy.', 'Diastole/Body Mass Index Ratio Can Predict Post-Thoracoscopic Surgery Metastasis in Stage I Lung Adenocarcinoma.']"""

Prostate specific antigen (PSA), prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA), and androgen receptor (AR) were compared for their detection sensitivity by real time PCR and nested PCR. In real time PCR, there was a significant correlation between cell number and the RNA concentration obtained (R(2)=0.9944) for PSA, PSMA, and AR. We found it possible to detect these markers from a single LNCaP cell in both real time and nested PCR. By comparison, nested PCR reached a linear curve in fewer PCR cycles than real time PCR, suggesting that nested PCR may offer PCR results more quickly than real time PCR. In conclusion, nested PCR may offer tumor maker detection in PCa cells more quickly (with fewer PCR cycles) with the same high sensitivity as real time PCR.

We examined the association of adiponectin and leptin levels in serum with prostate cancer risk after adjustments for age, obesity-related factors, and prostate cancer risk.  Methods:   Fifty-four prostate cancer patients and 70 control subjects provided blood sampled between 2008 and 2009. Using those, we determined serum adiponectin and leptin levels, and evaluated their relationships with prostate cancer risk after adjustments for age, obesity-related factors (body weight, body mass index, waist circumference), and prostate volume. Adipokine densities were calculated by dividing serum level with prostate volume.  Results:   There were no differences for median serum adiponectin and leptin levels between the prostate cancer and benign control groups (P=0.22 and 0.78, respectively). Patients with levels of both adipokines in the highest quartile after adjustment for age had significantly higher risks of prostate cancer (adiponectin: odds ratio [OR] 2.79, P=0.014; leptin: OR 2.72, P=0.027). Patients with an adiponectin level greater than the median after adjustment for body weight also had a significantly elevated risk of prostate cancer (OR 2.22, P=0.031), whereas, those with a leptin level significantly greater than the median had a significantly lower risk (OR 0.46, P=0.027). Furthermore, median adiponectin density was significantly higher in the prostate cancer group than the benign group (P=0.0033).

In particular, our earlier work has demonstrated its ability to inhibit cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis in multiple cancer cell lines representative of breast, prostate, as well as pancreatic cancers. However, its exact mechanism of action remains largely unclear. Here we show that garcinol also targets signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT-3) signaling pathway. STAT-3 is frequently found to be activated in many cancer types and this is the first report on such action of garcinol leading to its anticancer effects. Garcinol inhibited total, as well as phosphorylated, STAT-3 in breast, prostate and pancreatic cancer cell lines and was also found to inhibit cell invasion of all the cancer cell lines tested. STAT-3 phosphorylation was inhibited by garcinol in a dose-dependent manner. We also observed an inhibitory effect of garcinol on IL-6-induced STAT-3 phosphorylation and production of urokinase-type plasminogen activator, vascular endothelial growth factor and matrix metalloproteinase-9, which might explain the reduced invasion and aggressiveness of cells treated with garcinol. The results were further verified in vivo using MDA-MB-231 breast cancer mouse xenograft model where administration of garcinol significantly inhibited tumor growth, and western blot analysis of remnant tumor lysates showed reduced STAT-3 expression and activation.

These patients undergo palliative rather than curative treatment due to dissemination of cancer along nerves, well beyond the extent of any local invasion. Although CPNI is a common source of distant tumor spread and a cause of significant morbidity, its exact mechanism is undefined. Immunohistochemical analysis of specimens excised from patients with PDAs showed a significant increase in the number of endoneurial macrophages (EMΦ) that lie around nerves invaded by cancer compared with normal nerves. Video microscopy and time-lapse analysis revealed that EMΦs are recruited by the tumor cells in response to colony-stimulated factor-1 secreted by invading cancer cells. Conditioned medium (CM) of tumor-activated EMΦs (tEMΦ) induced a 5-fold increase in migration of PDA cells compared with controls. Compared with resting EMΦs, tEMΦs secreted higher levels of glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), inducing phosphorylation of RET and downstream activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) in PDA cells. Genetic and pharmacologic inhibition of the GDNF receptors GFRA1 and RET abrogated the migratory effect of EMΦ-CM and reduced ERK phosphorylation. In an in vivo CPNI model, CCR2-deficient mice that have reduced macrophage recruitment and activation showed minimal nerve invasion, whereas wild-type mice developed complete sciatic nerve paralysis due to massive CPNI.

We investigated the mechanisms underlying aberrant expression of transcripts involved in androgen metabolism in CRPC. We compared gene expression profiles and DNA copy number alteration (CNA) data from 29 normal prostate tissue samples, 127 primary prostate carcinomas (PCa), and 19 metastatic PCas. Steroidogenic enzyme transcripts were evaluated by quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR in PCa cell lines and circulating tumor cells (CTC) from CRPC patients. Metastatic PCas expressed higher transcript levels for AR and several steroidogenic enzymes, including SRD5A1, SRD5A3, and AKR1C3, whereas expression of SRD5A2, CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and CYP3A7 was decreased. This aberrant expression was rarely associated with CNAs. Instead, our data suggest distinct patterns of coordinated aberrant enzyme expression. Inhibition of AR activity by itself stimulated AKR1C3 expression. The aberrant expression of the steroidogenic enzyme transcripts was detected in CTCs from CRPC patients. In conclusion, our findings identify substantial interpatient heterogeneity and distinct patterns of dysregulated expression of enzymes involved in intratumoral androgen metabolism in PCa. These steroidogenic enzymes represent targets for complete suppression of systemic and intratumoral androgen levels, an objective that is supported by the clinical efficacy of the CYP17 inhibitor abiraterone.

The proliferation of prostate cancer cells is testosterone-driven, but clonal selection during androgen deprivation therapy promotes the development of androgen-independent (hormone-refractory) cells, which become phenotypically dominant. Human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2) is capable of activating the androgen receptor pathway, even in the absence of the ligand. The detection of phenotypic changes associated with the development of androgen independence may influence patient management, suggesting the initiation of a second-line therapy. This study aimed to establish the level of HER2 expression in a number of prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP, PC3 and DU145) in order that they be used as models in further studies, and to evaluate the binding and cellular processing of [(111)In]-labeled trastuzumab and the anti-HER2 synthetic Affibody molecule ABY-025 in these cell lines. The expression of HER2 was demonstrated and quantified in all three tested prostate cancer cell-lines. Studies on cellular processing demonstrated that internalization of both conjugates increased continuously during the whole incubation. The internalization rate was approximately equal for both monoclonal antibodies and Affibody molecules. In both cases, internalization was moderately rapid. Such features would definitely favor the use of radiometal labels for trastuzumab and, most likely, for affibody molecules.

Until 2010, docetaxel (Taxotere) was the only agent capable of improving survival in patients with metastatic CRPC. Since then, positive results from phase III trials have been reported for sipuleucel-T, cabazitaxel, denosumab, abiraterone, radium-223, and enzalutamide, while other promising agents including notably orteronel, ipilimumab and cabozantinib are currently under study. Taken together, the incorporation of these agents in the routine management of patients with CRPC is likely to expand their median life expectancy, which was only ∼1 year until the early 2000, to >30 months in the near future. The availability of these agents will lead to new challenges and questions, such as: Can our societies afford the costs?

To compare each protocol, we evaluated the pathological outcomes and calculated the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy for each protocol according to the proportion of organ-confined Gleason≤6 disease.  Results:   Overall, 376 patients met the inclusion criteria of the active surveillance protocols with 61, 325, 222, 212 and 206 patients meeting the criteria of the Johns Hopkins Medical Institution, University of California at San Francisco, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, University of Miami and Prostate Cancer Research International: Active Surveillance protocols, respectively.

We propose a new method aiming at correcting the potential bias due to the inadequate adjustment of the sample ascertainment. The method yields explicit correction formulas that can be used to both screen the genetic markers and rapidly evaluate the sensitivity of the results to the assumed baseline case-prevalence rate in the population.

To elucidate these issues, we used qualitative methods to explore the financial impact of a cancer diagnosis in Ireland, which has a mixed public-private healthcare system and where sick leave and sick pay are at employers' discretion.  Methods:   Face-to-face semi-structured interviews were conducted with hospital-based oncology social workers (OSWs; 21 OSWs from 11 hospitals) and patients (20 from eight hospitals; 11 breast, 5 prostate and 4 lung cancer). Participants were asked about the (1) extra expenses incurred, (2) cancer's impact on work and income, and (3) accessing financial assistance/social welfare benefits. The two interview sets were analysed separately using thematic analysis.  Results:   Broad themes that emerged included the wide range of additional cancer-related medical and non-medical expenses incurred by all patients, including those with medical cards (which entitle the bearer to receive health services free of charge) and those with private health insurance; the major impact of cancer and its treatment on work and patient/household income (all patients who were working at diagnosis experienced a drop in income); and difficulties in accessing medical cards and benefits.  Conclusions:   This study reveals the complex, multidimensional nature of the financial and economic burden cancer imposes on patients and the whole family unit. Changes in income post-cancer exacerbate the effects of cancer-related out-of-pocket expenses.

Materials and methods:   Between January 1995 and November 2010, 307 patients underwent adjuvant or salvage radiotherapy, after prostatectomy.  Results:   In the PORT group, 42 patients (20.7 %) had biochemical failure, with a median time to biochemical failure of 1.8 years; two parameters (age at diagnosis and PSA pre-RT) resulted to be significant at the survival analysis for overall survival (p = 0.003 and p = 0.046, respectively). In the SART group, 33 patients (31.7 %) had biochemical relapse; sixteen patients died of prostate cancer; postoperative hormones therapy, conformal radiotherapy and level of PSA pre-RT >1.0 ng/ml resulted to be significant at the survival analysis, p = 0.009, p = 0.039 and p = 0.002, respectively.  Conclusion:   Our study is limited by its retrospective and nonrandomized design.

Several prognostic factors allow differentiation of low-grade tumors from high-grade tumors with high metastatic potential. High-grade tumors are currently treated with hormone therapy, to which taxanes are added when the tumors become resistant to castration. Clinical trials with other anticancer agents did not take into account the genetic backgrounds of the tumors, and most trials demonstrated low response rates. Here we used an in silico approach to screen for drug candidates that might be used as alternatives to taxanes, on the basis of a published expression signature involving 86 genes that could distinguish high-grade and low-grade tumors (Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 103:10991-10996, 2006). We explored the National Cancer Institute databases, which include data on the gene expression profiles of 60 human tumor cell lines and the in vitro sensitivities of the cell lines to anticancer drugs, and we identified several genes in the signature for which expression levels were correlated with chemosensitivity. As an example of the validation of this in silico approach, we identified a set of six genes for which expression levels could predict cell sensitivity to oxaliplatin but not cisplatin. This signature was validated in vitro through silencing of the genes in DU145, LNCaP, and C4-2B prostate cancer cells, which was accompanied by changes in oxaliplatin but not cisplatin cytotoxicity. These results demonstrate the relevance of our approach for the identification of both alternative treatments for high-grade prostate cancers and new biomarkers to predict clinical tumor responses.""","""['Stéphane Puyo', 'Nadine Houédé', 'Audrey Kauffmann', 'Pierre Richaud', 'Jacques Robert', 'Philippe Pourquier']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Mol Pharmacol""","""['Ribozyme-mediated inhibition of PKCalpha sensitizes androgen-independent human prostate cancer cells to cisplatin-induced apoptosis.', 'Functional analysis of the gene expression profiles of colorectal cancer cell lines in relation to oxaliplatin and cisplatin cytotoxicity.', 'Preclinical antitumor activity of the oral platinum analog satraplatin.', 'Alterations in gene expression profiles during prostate cancer progression: functional correlations to tumorigenicity and down-regulation of selenoprotein-P in mouse and human tumors.', 'Overcoming bcl-2- and p53-mediated resistance in prostate cancer.', 'Bioinformatic analyses revealed underlying biological functions correlated with oxaliplatin responsiveness.', 'Gene expression analysis in RA: towards personalized medicine.']"""

We tried to verify silodosin's superiority to placebo and non-inferiority to tamsulosin in treating patients with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) associated with BPH.  Methods:   All randomized placebo- and active- controlled trials with silodosin were included systematically using Medline, Embase and The Cochrane Library. Primary outcome was International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and IPSS subsores; secondary outcomes were peak urinary flow rate (Q(max)), quality of life (QoL) and primary adverse events (AEs) included retrograde ejaculation, dizziness and headache.  Results:   The data of the included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were collected, extracted, and assessed by our protocol. Five RCTs including a total of 2595 patients were identified. Meta-analysis indicated that silodosin achieved significant improvement versus placebo in total IPSS, in IPSS subscores, and in Q(max); silodosin showed a greater improvement in voiding symptoms than tamsulosin, and a higher incidence of retrograde ejaculation than placebo and tamsulosin. No significant differences were observed in total IPSS, in IPSS storage symptoms, in Q(max) and in QoL when compared with tamsulosin. Silodosin was associated with the same low incidence of dizziness and headache with placebo and tamsulosin.  Conclusions:   Silodosin is an effective and well-tolerated treatment for both voiding and storage symptoms in patients with LUTS associated with BPH.

Ethanol and ethanol extracts are known apoptosis inducers. However, cytotoxic effects of ethanol on PCa cells are unclear.  Methods:   In this study we utilized PC3 and LNCaP cell culture models. We used immunohistochemical analysis, western blot analysis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) measurement, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) Cell Proliferation Assay, Annexin-V staining and flow cytometry for quantification of apoptosis. In vitro soft agar colony formation and Boyden chamber invasion assays were used. Tumorigenicity was measured in a xenotransplantation mouse model.  Results:   Here, we demonstrate that ethanol enhances the apoptosis-inducing potential of TRAIL in androgen-resistant PC3 cells and sensitizes TRAIL-resistant, androgen sensitive LNCaP cells to apoptosis through caspase activation, and a complete cleavage of poly (ADP)-ribose polymerase, which was in association with increased production of ROS. The cytotoxicity of ethanol was suppressed by an antioxidant N-acetyl cystein pretreatment. Furthermore, ethanol in combination with TRAIL increased the expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 and decreased the levels of Bcl-2 and phosphorylated-AKT. These molecular changes were accompanied by decreased proliferation, anchorage-independent growth and invasive potential of PC3 and LNCaP cells. In vivo studies using a xenotransplantation mouse model with PC3 cells demonstrated significantly increased apoptosis in tumors treated with ethanol and TRAIL in combination.

However, the kinases responsible for phosphorylating the AR at numerous sites and the functional consequences of AR phosphorylation are only partially understood. Bioinformatic analysis revealed AR serine 213 (S213) as a putative substrate for PIM1, a kinase overexpressed in prostate cancer. Therefore, phosphorylation of AR serine 213 by PIM1 was examined using a phosphorylation site-specific antibody. Wild-type PIM1, but not catalytically inactive PIM1, specifically phosphorylated AR but not an AR serine-to-alanine mutant (S213A). In vitro kinase assays confirmed that PIM1 can phosphorylate AR S213 in a ligand-independent manner and cell type-specific phosphorylation was observed in prostate cancer cell lines. Upon PIM1 overexpression, AR phosphorylation was observed in the absence of hormone and was further increased in the presence of hormone in LNCaP, LNCaP-abl and VCaP cells. Moreover, phosphorylation of AR was reduced in the presence of PIM kinase inhibitors. An examination of AR-mediated transcription showed that reporter gene activity was reduced in the presence of PIM1 and wild-type AR, but not S213A mutant AR. Androgen-mediated transcription of endogenous PSA, Nkx3.1 and IGFBP5 was also decreased in the presence of PIM1, whereas IL6, cyclin A1 and caveolin 2 were increased. Immunohistochemical analysis of prostate cancer tissue microarrays showed significant P-AR S213 expression that was associated with hormone refractory prostate cancers, likely identifying cells with catalytically active PIM1.

To identify yet unknown oncogenic functions of miR-106b, we overexpressed it in LNCaP human prostate cancer cells to examine miR-106b-induced global expression changes among protein-coding genes. The approach revealed that CASP7 is a direct target of miR-106b, which was confirmed by western blot analysis and a 3'-untranslated region reporter assay. Moreover, selected phenotypes induced by miR-106b knockdown in DU145 human prostate cancer cells did not develop when both miR-106b and CASP7 expression were inhibited. Further analyses showed that CASP7 is downregulated in primary prostate tumors and metastatic lesions across multiple data sets and is by itself associated with disease recurrence and disease-specific survival. Using bioinformatics, we also observed that miR-106b-25 may specifically influence focal adhesion-related pathways. This observation was experimentally examined using miR-106b-25-transduced 22Rv1 human prostate cancer cells. After infection with a miR-106b-25 lentiviral expression construct, 22Rv1 cells showed increased adhesion to basement membrane- and bone matrix-related filaments and enhanced soft agar growth.

One reliable indicator of outcome has been the determination of organ-confined versus nonorgan-confined disease but even this determination is often only made following prostatectomy. This underscores the need to explore alternate avenues to enhance outcome prediction of prostate cancer patients. Fluids that are proximal to the prostate, such as expressed prostatic secretions (EPS), are attractive sources of potential prostate cancer biomarkers as these fluids likely bathe the tumor. Direct-EPS samples from 16 individuals with extracapsular (n = 8) or organ-confined (n = 8) prostate cancer were used as a discovery cohort, and were analyzed in duplicate by a nine-step MudPIT on a LTQ-Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer. A total of 624 unique proteins were identified by at least two unique peptides with a 0.2% false discovery rate. A semiquantitative spectral counting algorithm identified 133 significantly differentially expressed proteins in the discovery cohort. Integrative data mining prioritized 14 candidates, including two known prostate cancer biomarkers: prostate-specific antigen and prostatic acid phosphatase, which were significantly elevated in the direct-EPS from the organ-confined cancer group. These and five other candidates (SFN, MME, PARK7, TIMP1, and TGM4) were verified by Western blotting in an independent set of direct-EPS from patients with biochemically recurrent disease (n = 5) versus patients with no evidence of recurrence upon follow-up (n = 10). Lastly, we performed proof-of-concept SRM-MS-based relative quantification of the five candidates using unpurified heavy isotope-labeled synthetic peptides spiked into pools of EPS-urines from men with extracapsular and organ-confined prostate tumors.

In situations where the optimal classification decision can be identified by an exhaustive search over all possible classes, means for adjusting classifier performance, such as probability thresholding or weighting the a posteriori probabilities, are well established. Unfortunately, analogous methods compatible with Markov random fields (i.e. large collections of dependent random variables) are noticeably absent from the literature. Consequently, most Markov random field (MRF) based classification systems typically restrict their performance to a single, static operating point (i.e. a paired sensitivity/specificity). To address this deficiency, we previously introduced an extension of maximum posterior marginals (MPM) estimation that allows certain classes to be weighted more heavily than others, thus providing a means for varying classifier performance. However, this extension is not appropriate for the more popular maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation. Thus, a strategy for varying the performance of MAP estimators is still needed. Such a strategy is essential for several reasons: (1) the MAP cost function may be more appropriate in certain classification tasks than the MPM cost function, (2) the literature provides a surfeit of MAP estimation implementations, several of which are considerably faster than the typical Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods used for MPM, and (3) MAP estimation is used far more often than MPM. Consequently, in this paper we introduce multiplicative weighted MAP (MWMAP) estimation-achieved via the incorporation of multiplicative weights into the MAP cost function-which allows certain classes to be preferred over others. This creates a natural bias for specific classes, and consequently a means for adjusting classifier performance. Similarly, we show how this multiplicative weighting strategy can be applied to the MPM cost function (in place of the strategy we presented previously), yielding multiplicative weighted MPM (MWMPM) estimation. Furthermore, we describe how MWMAP and MWMPM can be implemented using adaptations of current estimation strategies such as iterated conditional modes and MPM Monte Carlo. To illustrate these implementations, we first integrate them into two separate MRF-based classification systems for detecting carcinoma of the prostate (CaP) on (1) digitized histological sections from radical prostatectomies and (2) T2-weighted 4 Tesla ex vivo prostate MRI. To highlight the extensibility of MWMAP and MWMPM to estimation tasks involving more than two classes, we also incorporate these estimation criteria into a MRF-based classifier used to segment synthetic brain MR images. In the context of these tasks, we show how our novel estimation criteria can be used to arbitrarily adjust the sensitivities of these systems, yielding receiver operator characteristic curves (and surfaces).""","""['James P Monaco', 'Anant Madabhushi']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Med Image Anal""","""['Weighted maximum posterior marginals for random fields using an ensemble of conditional densities from multiple Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations.', 'A segmentation of brain MRI images utilizing intensity and contextual information by Markov random field.', 'High-throughput detection of prostate cancer in histological sections using probabilistic pairwise Markov models.', 'Applications of Monte Carlo Simulation in Modelling of Biochemical Processes.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Survey of methods and principles in three-dimensional reconstruction from two-dimensional medical images.', 'Automated Optical Inspection for Defect Identification and Classification in Actual Woven Fabric Production Lines.', 'A Novel High Recognition Rate Defect Inspection Method for Carbon Fiber Plain-Woven Prepreg Based on Image Texture Feature Compression.', 'Habitat Analysis of Breast Cancer-Enhanced MRI Reflects BRCA1 Mutation Determined by Immunohistochemistry.', 'Automated gleason grading on prostate biopsy slides by statistical representations of homology profile.']"""

AND WHAT DOES THE STUDY ADD?: The link between inflammation and cancer has long been reported and inflammation is thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of many cancers, including prostate cancer (PrCa). Over the last 5 years, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have reported numerous susceptibility loci that predispose individuals to many different traits. The present study aims to ascertain if there are common genetic risk profiles that might predispose individuals to both PrCa and the autoimmune inflammatory condition, rheumatoid arthritis. These results could have potential public heath impact in terms of screening and chemoprevention.  Objectives:   To investigate if potential common pathways exist for the pathogenesis of autoimmune disease and prostate cancer (PrCa). To ascertain if the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) reported by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) as being associated with susceptibility to PrCa are also associated with susceptibility to the autoimmune disease rheumatoid arthritis (RA).  Materials and methods:   The original Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC) UK RA GWAS study was expanded to include a total of 3221 cases and 5272 controls. In all, 37 germline autosomal SNPs at genome-wide significance associated with PrCa risk were identified from a UK/Australian PrCa GWAS. Allele frequencies were compared for these 37 SNPs between RA cases and controls using a chi-squared trend test and corrected for multiple testing (Bonferroni).  Results:   In all, 33 SNPs were able to be analysed in the RA dataset. Proxies could not be located for the SNPs in 3q26, 5p15 and for two SNPs in 17q12. After applying a Bonferroni correction for the number of SNPs tested, the SNP mapping to CCHCR1 (rs130067) retained statistically significant evidence for association (P = 6 × 10(-4) ; odds ratio [OR] = 1.15, 95% CI: 1.06-1.24); this has also been associated with psoriasis. However, further analyses showed that the association of this allele was due to confounding by RA-associated HLA-DRB1 alleles.  Conclusions:   There is currently no evidence that SNPs associated with PrCa at genome-wide significance are associated with the development of RA.

Marked differences in uncertainty among patients have been found relating to race and social environment indicating that as uncertainty increases, social functioning declines. Correlations have been found between uncertainty and patients' coping, psychological adjustment and perceptions of their health and illness. Studies suggest the detrimental effect of uncertainty among patients with prostate cancer in the perception of their quality of life. These studies underline the potential benefit of targeted intervention. The study provides a unique insight into the impact of uncertainty and perception of danger on overall satisfaction with treatment outcomes in men with prostate cancer. Its results suggest that possible disparities related to patient racial background and education may exist in the perception of cancer-related uncertainty. Racial and educational disparities, coupled with a mild to moderate association of uncertainty or danger perception and overall outcome satisfaction, suggest an unmet need for healthcare and nursing services for men undergoing treatment for prostate cancer.  Objectives:   To investigate patient uncertainty and perception of danger regarding prospects for clinical prostate cancer control. To determine the impact of these factors on satisfaction with overall prostate cancer treatment outcome.  Patients and methods:   Men who had undergone primary treatment for early stage prostate cancer and who were participants in the Prostate Cancer Outcomes and Satisfaction with Treatment Quality Assessment (PROSTQA) prospective cohort study of prostate cancer outcomes (the parent study) were offered the opportunity to participate in the present study. Centralized phone interviews were conducted to determine patient-reported uncertainty regarding cancer status (measured by the Mishel Uncertainty in Illness Scale-Community Form), perception of danger (measured by Folkman and Lazarus' Appraisal Scale) and satisfaction with treatment outcome (measured by the Service Satisfaction Scale for Cancer Care). The study used the same centralized telephone interview centre as was used in the parent study. Data were collected at 48, 60 or 72 months after the completion of prostate cancer treatment. Relationships among measures were characterized by Spearman rank correlation coefficients (r).  Results:   A total of 338 agreed to participate, representing 76% of those who were invited. Younger patients experienced less uncertainty (r = 0.20, P < 0.001), yet reported greater perception of danger (r = -0.12; P = 0.03) concerning their previously treated prostate cancer. African-American patients showed greater uncertainty than other ethnic groups (P = 0.005) but did not have a greater perception of danger (P = 0.36). Education played a major role in uncertainty; patients with lower levels of education tended to report higher degrees of uncertainty (r = -0.25; P < 0.001). There was a mild to moderate general association between the three outcomes. A greater sense of uncertainty was associated with a greater perception of danger (r = 0.34, P < 0.001), and as danger and uncertainty increased, satisfaction with treatment outcome tended to decrease (r was between -0.30 and -0.34, P < 0.001).  Conclusions:   Results suggest that possible disparities related to patient racial background and education may exist in the perception of cancer-related uncertainty.

In animals, anogenital distance has been shown to be related to the action of fetal androgens, and exposure to chemicals such as dioxins that exhibit antiandrogenic activity results in shorter distances in male rats. In studies conducted in children, anogenital distance has been associated with endocrine disruptors such as phthalates. Studies conducted in young adults found that a shorter anoscrotal distance was a predictor of low sperm concentration, and a longer anoscrotal distance was associated with fatherhood, a higher sperm density and a higher total motile sperm count. The present study is the first to report anogenital measurements in adults in relation to the risk of cancer, showing that a phenotype reflecting normal in utero sexual development in males is associated with a lower risk of prostate cancer. There are two published studies evaluating sperm quality and fatherhood suggesting a connecting mechanism related to the disruption of androgen-mediated pathways in utero that affects reproductive potential and the risk of prostate cancer.  Objectives:   • To measure anogenital distance in patients with prostate cancer and control subjects without cancer. • To evaluate the association of anogenital distance with prostate cancer in a case-control study in Spain.  Materials and methods:   • Anogenital distances from anus to upper penis (AGDAP ) and from anus to scrotum (AGDAS ) were measured in 60 patients with prostate cancer in two hospitals in Barcelona and in 52 urological controls. • Each measurement was performed three times by the same trained examiner using a digital caliper  Results:   • Patients had an ≈5 mm shorter AGDAP than controls, whereas no difference was observed for AGDAS . • A higher AGDAP was associated with a lower risk of prostate cancer, with an adjusted odds ratio per 5 mm increase in AGDAP of 0.83 (95% confidence interval, 0.70-0.99, P= 0.03).  Conclusions:   • The present study is the first to report anogenital measurements in adults in relation to the risk of cancer. • The present study showed that a phenotype reflecting normal in utero sexual development in men is associated with a lower risk of prostate cancer. • There are two published studies (Mendiola et al.

What's known on the subject? and What does the study add? The efficacy of prostate cancer screening using PSA testing is still being debated, with conflicting results in randomized trials. The study shows that, even using the hypothesis most favourable to prostate cancer screening with PSA, the net number of years of life does not favour screening.  Objective:   • To evaluate the impact of the implementation a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening programme using the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) results and taking into account the impact of prostate biopsy and over-treatment on mortality.  Materials and methods:   • We used a model based on the number of years of life gained and lost owing to screening, using data reported in the ERSPC. • We conducted a critical evaluation of the ERSPC results and of the Swedish arm of the study.  Results:   • Accounting for biopsy-specific mortality and for over-treatment, the balance of number of years of life was negative in the ERSPC study, with an estimated loss of 3.6 years of life per avoided death. • The number of years of life becomes positive (real gain) only when fewer than 666 screened individuals are required to avoid one death. • We found that in the Swedish arm of the ERSPC there was a biopsy rate of 40% compared with 27% in the ERSPC overall. The over-treatment rate was also greater with 4.1% compared with 3.4% overall. • For the last 20 years, there has been a marked difference in prostate cancer-specific mortality between Sweden and the rest of Europe: in 2005, for the age group 65-74 the rate was 140 per 100,000 person years in Sweden and ~80 per 100,000 for the rest of Europe.

To do this, we fused it to an antimicrobial peptide, (D)(KLAKLAK)(2), and termed the resulting peptide TMTP1-DKK. We found that TMTP1-DKK could trigger rapid apoptosis in human prostate and gastric cancer cells through both the mitochondrial-induced apoptosis pathway and the death receptor pathway.

Multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibition has recently shown promise in the management of castration-resistant prostate cancer. In some cases, TKI inhibition has produced unprecedented improvements in bone metastases as detected by (99m)Tc-MDP bone scans. The significance of these improvements is not known. In order to gain insight about the effects of TKIs on bone scans in prostate cancer, we systematically evaluated images from a phase II study of sunitinib, a multitargeted TKI.  Methods:   We analyzed images and data from a previously reported open-label phase II study that enrolled 34 men with advanced castration-resistant prostate cancer. Participants received sunitinib in 6-wk cycles (50 mg daily; 4 wk on, 2 wk off). We examined baseline and 12-wk bone scan images. Partial response was defined as an improvement of at least 50% in previous metastatic lesions subjectively or a change from prior diffuse skeletal metastases (superscan) to recognizable individual metastatic lesions. Our primary objective was to define the incidence of at least partial bone scan response. We also examined concomitant changes in CT and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) evidence of disease.  Results:   Analysis at 12 wk revealed 1 partial response by the response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) and 2 confirmed PSA responses. There were 25 subjects who underwent bone scans at both time points (baseline and week 12) and who had bone metastases detectable at baseline. Within that group of 25, we found 5 bone scan partial responses and 1 complete response. None of those 6 subjects exhibited a PSA response (≥50% decline from baseline) or RECIST response.  Conclusion:   We found a relatively high rate of (99m)Tc-MDP bone scan response to sunitinib among men with metastatic prostate cancer. Further, we found that none of the subjects exhibiting bone scan responses experienced concordant improvements in PSA or CT evidence of disease by accepted criteria. This discordance argues that osteoblastic assessment provides an incomplete assessment of treatment-induced changes. Rational development of multitargeted TKIs for prostate cancer requires improved understanding of treatment-induced bone scan changes.

Owing to their intrinsic optical, electrical and magnetic properties, nanoparticles are promising contrast agents for imaging dynamic molecular and cellular processes such as protein-protein interactions, enzyme activity or gene expression. Until now, nanoparticles have been engineered with targeting ligands such as antibodies and peptides to improve tumour specificity and uptake. However, excessive loading of ligands can reduce the targeting capabilities of the ligand and reduce the ability of the nanoparticle to bind to a finite number of receptors on cells. Increasing the number of nanoparticles delivered to cells by each targeting molecule would lead to higher signal-to-noise ratios and would improve image contrast. Here, we show that M13 filamentous bacteriophage can be used as a scaffold to display targeting ligands and multiple nanoparticles for magnetic resonance imaging of cancer cells and tumours in mice. Monodisperse iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles assemble along the M13 coat, and its distal end is engineered to display a peptide that targets SPARC glycoprotein, which is overexpressed in various cancers. Compared with nanoparticles that are directly functionalized with targeting peptides, our approach improves contrast because each SPARC-targeting molecule delivers a large number of nanoparticles into the cells. Moreover, the targeting ligand and nanoparticles could be easily exchanged for others, making this platform attractive for in vivo high-throughput screening and molecular detection.""","""['Debadyuti Ghosh', 'Youjin Lee', 'Stephanie Thomas', 'Aditya G Kohli', 'Dong Soo Yun', 'Angela M Belcher', 'Kimberly A Kelly']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Nat Nanotechnol""","""['Receptor-targeted nanoparticles for in vivo imaging of breast cancer.', 'Deep, noninvasive imaging and surgical guidance of submillimeter tumors using targeted M13-stabilized single-walled carbon nanotubes.', 'Peptide-conjugated nanoparticles for targeted imaging and therapy of prostate cancer.', 'Current state and future applications of active targeting in malignancies using superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles.', 'Dextran-coated iron oxide nanoparticles: a versatile platform for targeted molecular imaging, molecular diagnostics, and therapy.', 'Engineered M13 phage as a novel therapeutic bionanomaterial for clinical applications: From tissue regeneration to cancer therapy.', 'Precision diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'M13 phage: a versatile building block for a highly specific analysis platform.', 'Virus-like nanoparticles as a theranostic platform for cancer.', 'Peptide-functionalized NaGdF4 nanoparticles for tumor-targeted magnetic resonance imaging and effective therapy.']"""

One such selective vulnerability is the sensitivity of BRCA1- or BRCA2-defective tumors (hence defective in DNA repair by homologous recombination, HR) to inhibitors of the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1), an enzyme critical for repair pathways alternative to HR. While promising, treatment with PARP-1 inhibitors (PARP-1i) faces some hurdles, including (1) acquired resistance, (2) search for other sensitizing, non-BRCA1/2 cancer defects and (3) lack of biomarkers to predict response to PARP-1i. Here we addressed these issues using PARP-1i on 20 human cell lines from carcinomas of the breast, prostate, colon, pancreas and ovary. Aberrations of the Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 (MRN) complex sensitized cancer cells to PARP-1i, while p53 status was less predictive, even in response to PARP-1i combinations with camptothecin or ionizing radiation. Furthermore, monitoring PARsylation and Rad51 foci formation as surrogate markers for PARP activity and HR, respectively, supported their candidacy for biomarkers of PARP-1i responses. As to resistance mechanisms, we confirmed the role of the multidrug resistance efflux transporters and its reversibility. More importantly, we demonstrated that shRNA lentivirus-mediated depletion of 53BP1 in human BRCA1-mutant breast cancer cells increased their resistance to PARP-1i.

The differential diagnosis includes high-grade prostatic adenocarcinoma, spread from an anal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), or spread from a uterine cervical SCC. In terms of metastatic UC, the most common problem is differentiating spread of UC to the lung from a primary pulmonary SCC. Immunohistochemical analysis (IHC) for GATA binding protein 3 (GATA3), thrombomodulin (THROMBO), and uroplakin III was performed on a tissue microarray (TMA) containing 35 cases of invasive high-grade UC. GATA3 IHC was also performed on TMAs containing 38 high-grade (Gleason score ≥8) prostatic adenocarcinomas, representative tissue sections from 15 invasive anal SCCs, representative tissue sections from 19 invasive cervical SCCs, and TMAs with 12 invasive cervical carcinomas of the cervix [SCC (n=10), SCC with neuroendocrine features (n=1), and adenosquamous carcinoma (n=1)]. In addition, GATA3 IHC was performed on representative tissue sections from 15 pulmonary UC metastases and a TMA with 25 SCCs of the lung and 5 pulmonary non-small cell carcinomas with squamous features. GATA3, THROMBO, and uroplakin III were positive in 28 (80%), 22 (63%), and 21 (60%) cases of high-grade UC, respectively. All cases of GATA3-positive staining were nonfocal; 25 (89%) cases demonstrated moderate to strong staining, and 3 (11%) demonstrated weak staining. Of the 7 cases that failed to express GATA3, 5 were positive for THROMBO and/or uroplakin III, whereas 2 were negative for all 3 markers. None of the 38 high-grade prostatic adenocarcinomas was positive for GATA3. Weak GATA3 staining was present in occasional basal cells of benign prostate glands, in a few benign atrophic glands, and in urothelial metaplasia. Of the 15 cases of anal SCCs, 2 (7%) cases showed focal weak staining, and 1 (3%) showed focal moderate staining. Weak staining was also rarely observed in the benign anal squamous epithelium. Of the 31 uterine cervical carcinomas, 6 (19%) showed weak GATA3 staining (3 nonfocal and 3 focal), and 2 (6%) demonstrated focal moderate staining. Twelve (80%) of the metastatic UCs to the lung were positive for GATA3, with 11 cases showing diffuse moderate or strong staining and 1 case showing focal moderate staining. None of the pulmonary SCCs or non-small cell carcinomas with squamous features was GATA3 positive. GATA3 IHC is a sensitive marker for UC, and positive staining in UC is typically nonfocal and moderate or strong in intensity. GATA3 is also highly specific in excluding high-grade prostate adenocarcinoma. Although some cervical and anal SCCs can be GATA3 positive, unlike in UC, staining is more commonly focal and weak. GATA3 is also a useful maker when diagnosing metastatic UC to the lung.""","""['Alex Chang', 'Ali Amin', 'Edward Gabrielson', 'Peter Illei', 'Richard B Roden', 'Rajni Sharma', 'Jonathan I Epstein']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Am J Surg Pathol""","""['GATA3 immunohistochemical expression in invasive urothelial carcinoma.', 'Is GATA3 expression maintained in regional metastases?: a study of paired primary and metastatic urothelial carcinomas.', 'GATA3 expression in metastatic urothelial carcinoma in fine needle aspiration cell blocks: a review of 25 cases.', 'Best practices recommendations in the application of immunohistochemistry in the prostate: report from the International Society of Urologic Pathology consensus conference.', 'Immunohistochemistry in diagnostic surgical pathology of the prostate.', 'Immunohistochemical Assays for Bladder Cancer Molecular Subtyping: Optimizing Parsimony and Performance of Lund Taxonomy Classifiers.', 'Diagnostic Relevance of GATA 3 Expression in Urinary Bladder Carcinoma of Divergent Differentiation and Other Histological Variants.', 'The secondary tumor of the prostate derived from upper tract urothelial carcinoma: An autopsy case.', 'Diagnostic and prognostic implications of a three-antibody molecular subtyping algorithm for non-muscle invasive bladder cancer.', 'Association Between Estrogen Receptors and GATA3 in Bladder Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Their Clinicopathological Significance.']"""

Methods:   Data on cancer patients (1999 to 2008) were retrieved from the institutional cancer registry and linked to electronic files to obtain diabetes status and hemoglobin A1c (A1C) values within the first 6 months of cancer diagnosis. Overall survival by cancer type with and without diabetes was compared using Cox regression.  Results:   Excluding skin and hematologic malignancies, 15,951 cancer cases were identified. Overall diabetes prevalence was 6.8% (n = 1,090), declining over time (P<0.001). Diabetes was common among patients with pancreatic (9.8% [61 of 624]), colorectal (7.7% [89 of 1,151]), or bladder cancers (7.6% [68 of 899]). Patients with diabetes were older (mean age, 70 versus 66 years; P<0.001) and more likely to be male (66.3% [723 of 1,090] versus 60.2% [8,949 of 14,858]; P<0.001). The mean A1C among diabetic cancer patients was 6.8% and did not differ across cancer types (P = 0.80). Only 58.6% (331 of 565) of diabetic cancer patients had all A1C <7.0% during the first 6 months following cancer diagnosis. Pancreatic cancer patients with coexisting diabetes had better overall survival than pancreatic cancer patients without diabetes (hazard ratio, 0.60; 95% confidence interval 0.44 to 0.80; P<0.001). Conversely, diabetic prostate cancer patients had worse overall survival than prostate cancer patients without diabetes (hazard ratio, 1.36; 95% confidence interval 1.05 to 1.76; P = 0.02).

These vesicles contain microRNAs and might therefore be vehicles transferring genetic information between cells. The aim of this study was to investigate whether there was a sorting of microRNAs into exosomes in the prostate cancer cell line PC-3. In addition, microRNAs in PC-3 cells and in the non-cancerous prostate cell line RWPE-1 were compared. Exosomes were isolated from the conditioned media from PC-3 cells by ultracentrifugation and inspected by electron microscopy. Total RNA was isolated and microRNAs were analyzed by microarray analysis and real time RT-PCR. MicroRNA microarray analysis revealed that the microRNA profile of PC-3 released exosomes was similar to the profile of the corresponding parent cells. Nevertheless, a sorting of certain microRNAs into exosomes was observed, and low number microRNAs (microRNAs with a low number in their name) were found to be underrepresented in these vesicles. Moreover, the miRNA profile of PC-3 cells resembled the miRNA profile of RWPE-1 cells, though some miRNAs were found to be differently expressed in these cell lines. These results show that exosomes from PC-3 cells, in agreement with previous reports from other cell types, contain microRNAs. Furthermore, this study supports the idea that there is a sorting of microRNAs into exosomes and adds a new perspective by pointing at the underrepresentation of low number miRNAs in PC-3 released exosomes.""","""['Nina Pettersen Hessvik', 'Santosh Phuyal', 'Andreas Brech', 'Kirsten Sandvig', 'Alicia Llorente']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Biochim Biophys Acta""","""['Lectin-induced agglutination method of urinary exosomes isolation followed by mi-RNA analysis: Application for prostate cancer diagnostic.', 'Exosome-like Extracellular Vesicles from MYCN-amplified Neuroblastoma Cells Contain Oncogenic miRNAs.', 'Plasma exosome microRNAs are indicative of breast cancer.', 'Integrated systems for exosome investigation.', 'Signaling by exosomal microRNAs in cancer.', 'Tumor-derived extracellular vesicle nucleic acids as promising diagnostic biomarkers for prostate cancer.', 'Exosome-Autophagy Crosstalk in Enveloped Virus Infection.', 'siRNA screening reveals that SNAP29 contributes to exosome release.', 'Follicular fluid-derived exosomal miR-143-3p/miR-155-5p regulate follicular dysplasia by modulating glycolysis in granulosa cells in polycystic ovary syndrome.', 'Uptake, functionality, and re-release of extracellular vesicle-encapsulated cargo.']"""

This study described a practical platform strategy to address these challenges, using comparison of drug response proteomic signatures by two promising anti-cancer agents (KX01/KX02) as the model system for method development/optimization. Drug-treated samples were efficiently extracted followed by precipitation/on-pellet-digestion procedure that provides high, reproducible peptide recovery. High-resolution separations were performed on a 75-cm-long, heated nano-LC column with a 7-h gradient, with a highly reproducible nano-LC/nanospray configuration. An LTQ Orbitrap hybrid mass spectrometer with a charge overfilling approach to enhance sensitivity was used for detection. Analytical procedures were optimized and well-controlled to achieve high run-to-run reproducibility that permits numerous replicates in one set, and an ion-current-based approach was utilized for quantification. The false positives of biomarker discovery arising from technical variability was controlled based on FBDR measurement by comparing biomarker numbers in each drug-treated group vs. ""sham samples"", which were analyzed in an order randomly interleaved with the analysis drug-treated samples. More than 1500 unique protein groups were quantified under stringent criteria, and of which about 30% displayed differential expression with FBDR of 0.3-2.1% across groups. Comparison of drug-response proteomic signatures and the subsequent immunoassay revealed that the action mechanisms of KX01/KX02 are similar but significantly different from vinblastine, which correlates well with clinical and pre-clinical observations. Furthermore, the results strongly supported the hypothesis that KX01/KX02 are dual-action agents (through inhibition of tubulin and Src). Moreover, informative insights into the drug-actions on cell cycle, growth/proliferation, and apoptosis were obtained.

Accordingly, allelic variations of MnSOD that have been shown to augment levels of MnSOD in mitochondria result in a 10-fold increase in prostate cancer risk. In addition, epidemiologic studies indicate that reduced glutathione peroxidase activity along with increases in H(2)O(2) further increase cancer risk in the face of MnSOD overexpression.

We investigated varicella zoster virus thymidine kinase (VZV-tk) as new PRG with radiolabeled bicyclic nucleoside analogues (BCNAs) as PET tracers.  Methods:   The uptake and washout of four different radiolabeled BCNAs was evaluated in cells expressing VZV-tk after lentiviral vector (LV) transduction and in control cells. Metabolism of the tracers was assayed by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). Mice bearing VZV-TK expressing xenografts were imaged with PET.  Results:   High uptake in VZV-tk expressing cells was seen for 3 of the 4 tracers tested. The uptake of the tracers could be blocked by the presence of excess thymidine in the incubation solution. Cellular retention was variable, with one tracer showing an acceptable half-life of ~1 hour. The amount of intracellular tracer correlated with the titer of LV used to transduce the cells. VZV-TK dependent conversion into metabolites was shown by HPLC. No specific accumulation was observed in cells expressing a fusion protein containing an HSV1-TK moiety. VZV-tk expression in xenografts resulted in a 60% increase in uptake in vivo as measured with PET.

Materials and methods:   Forty-four patients underwent prostate MRI at 1.5 T using a pelvic phased-array coil, including T1-weighted imaging (T1WI), T2-weighted imaging (T2WI), diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) imaging, before prostatectomy. Three radiologists independently reviewed images during four sessions [T2WI, DWI, DCE, and all parameters combined (MP-MRI)] to assess for tumour in each sextant. In a separate session, readers reviewed T1WI to score the extent of haemorrhage per sextant. Accuracy was assessed using logistic regression for correlated data.  Results:   There was no significant difference in accuracy between readers for any session (p ≥ 0.166), and results were averaged across the three readers for remaining comparisons. Accuracy was significantly greater for MP-MRI than for any parameter alone (p ≤ 0.020). For T2WI alone, there was a trend toward decreased sensitivity in sextants with extensive haemorrhage (p = 0.072). However, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were otherwise similar for sextants with and without extensive haemorrhage for all sessions (p = 0.192-0.934). No session showed a significant improvement in accuracy, sensitivity, or specificity in cases with delay after biopsy of over 4 weeks compared with shorter delay.

It has been challenging to comprehensively evaluate the genome of advanced prostate cancer (PCa) because of limited access to metastatic tissue.  Objective:   To demonstrate the feasibility of a novel next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based platform that can be used with archival formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) biopsy tissue to evaluate the spectrum of DNA alterations seen in advanced PCa.  Design, setting, and participants:   FFPE samples (including archival prostatectomies and prostate needle biopsies) were obtained from 45 patients representing the spectrum of disease: localized PCa, metastatic hormone-naive PCa, and metastatic castration-resistant PCa (CRPC). We also assessed paired primaries and metastases to understand disease heterogeneity and disease progression.  Intervention:   At least 50 ng of tumor DNA was extracted from FFPE samples and used for hybridization capture and NGS using the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   A total of 3320 exons of 182 cancer-associated genes and 37 introns of 14 commonly rearranged genes were evaluated for genomic alterations.  Results and limitations:   We obtained an average sequencing depth of >900X. Overall, 44% of CRPCs harbored genomic alterations involving the androgen receptor gene (AR), including AR copy number gain (24% of CRPCs) or AR point mutation (20% of CRPCs). Other recurrent mutations included transmembrane protease, serine 2 gene (TMPRSS2):v-ets erythroblastosis virus E26 oncogene homolog (avian) gene (ERG) fusion (44%); phosphatase and tensin homolog gene (PTEN) loss (44%); tumor protein p53 gene (TP53) mutation (40%); retinoblastoma gene (RB) loss (28%); v-myc myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog (avian) gene (MYC) gain (12%); and phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase, catalytic subunit α gene (PIK3CA) mutation (4%). There was a high incidence of genomic alterations involving key genes important for DNA repair, including breast cancer 2, early onset gene (BRCA2) loss (12%) and ataxia telangiectasia mutated gene (ATM) mutations (8%); these alterations are potentially targetable with poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose)polymerase inhibitors. A novel and actionable rearrangement involving the v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 gene (BRAF) was also detected.

Prostate cancer is the most frequently diagnosed malignancy and the second-leading cause of cancer death in men. In spite of the current therapeutic options for this cancer entity, many patients die due to metastases in distant organs and acquired chemotherapy resistance. Thus, approaches to provide improvements in outcome and quality of life for such patients are urgently needed. Recently, the polyisoprenylated benzophenone 7-epi-nemorosone, originally collected by honeybees from Clusia rosea and Clusia grandiflora (Clusiaceae), has been described to be a potent antitumoral agent. Here, its activity in prostate carcinoma is reported. 7-epi-nemorosone was isolated from Caribbean propolis employing RP-HPLC techniques. Its cytotoxicity was assessed using the MTT proliferation assay in human androgen-dependent prostate carcinoma LNCaP cells including an MDR1(+) sub-line. No cross-resistance was detected. FACS-based cell cycle analysis revealed a significant increase in the sub-G0/G1, G1, and depletion in the S phase populations. A concomitant down-regulation of cyclins D1/D3 and CDK 4/6 in LNCaP cells was detected by Western blot. Annexin-V-FITC labeling and caspase-3 cleavage assays showed that 7-epi-nemorosone induced apoptotic events. Major signal transduction elements such as p38 MAPK and Akt/PKB as well as androgen receptor AR and PSA production were found to be down-regulated after exposure to the drug. ERK1/2 protein levels and phosphorylation status were down-regulated accompanied by up-regulation but inhibition of the activity of their immediate upstream kinases MEK1/2. Additionally, Akt/PKB enzymatic activity was effectively inhibited at a similar concentration as for MEK1/2. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that 7-epi-nemorosone exerts cytotoxicity in an androgen-dependent prostate carcinoma entity by targeting the MEK1/2 signal transducer.""","""['David Díaz-Carballo', 'Sebastian Gustmann', 'Ali Haydar Acikelli', 'Walter Bardenheuer', 'Helmut Buehler', 'Holger Jastrow', 'Suleyman Ergun', 'Dirk Strumberg']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Phytomedicine""","""['Nemorosone blocks proliferation and induces apoptosis in leukemia cells.', 'Cytotoxic activity of nemorosone in neuroblastoma cells.', 'Effects of nemorosone, isolated from the plant Clusia rosea, on the cell cycle and gene expression in MCF-7 BUS breast cancer cell lines.', 'The role of cyclins in the development and progression of prostate cancer.', 'A review of nemorosone: Chemistry and biological properties.', 'The antiviral and immunomodulatory activities of propolis: An update and future perspectives for respiratory diseases.', 'Evaluation of estrogenic, antiestrogenic and genotoxic activity of nemorosone, the major compound found in brown Cuban propolis.', 'Nemorosone and its emerging anti-neoplastic effects.']"""

However, its effect in men with no or at least a single risk factor for CAD stratified by prostate cancer (PCa) aggressiveness is unknown.  Objective:   To assess whether NHT use affects the risk of ACM in men with low-, intermediate-, and high-risk PCa treated with brachytherapy who have no or at least a single risk factor for CAD.  Design, setting, and participants:   This retrospective study cohort consisted of 5411 men with low-risk PCa (prostate-specific antigen [PSA] <10 ng/ml, Gleason score 6, and clinical stage T1-T2a); 4365 men with intermediate-risk PCa (PSA 10-20 ng/ml or Gleason score <8 or clinical stage <T3); and 1360 men with localized or locally advanced, high-risk PCa consecutively treated in a community-based, multi-institutional setting between 1991 and 2006. CAD risk factors included at least a history of diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, or hypertension. The median follow-up for men with low-, intermediate-, and high-risk PCa were 4.1, 4.4, and 4.6 yr, respectively.  Interventions:   Men were treated with or without a median duration of 4 mo of NHT followed by brachytherapy with or without supplemental external-beam radiation therapy (EBRT).  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Cox regression multivariable analyses were performed to assess whether NHT use affected the risk of ACM in men with low-, intermediate-, and high-risk PCa, adjusting for age; year of brachytherapy; supplemental EBRT use; the presence of CAD risk factors; treatment propensity score; and known PCa prognostic factors, including pretreatment PSA level, biopsy Gleason score, and clinical stage.  Results and limitations:   NHT use was associated with a significantly increased risk of ACM in men with low-risk PCa (adjusted hazard ratio [HR]: 1.27; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.07-1.51; p<0.01) but not in men with intermediate-risk (adjusted HR: 1.13; 95% CI, 0.96-1.35; p=0.15) or high-risk PCa (adjusted HR: 0.86; 95% CI, 0.66-1.13; p=0.28). Using an interaction model for the low-risk group, NHT use was associated with a significantly increased risk of ACM in the subgroup of men with at least a single CAD risk factor (adjusted HR: 1.36; 95% CI, 1.07-1.74; p=0.01) but not for men with no CAD risk factors (adjusted HR: 1.19; 95% CI, 0.95-1.51; p=0.13).  Conclusions:   For men with no or at least a single risk factor for CAD, NHT use is associated with an increased risk of ACM in the setting of low-risk but not intermediate- or high-risk PCa. This effect is driven by the subgroup of men with at least a single risk factor for CAD.

Objective:   To assess outcomes following AS of men with screen-detected PCa.  Design, setting, and participants:   Of the 968 men who were diagnosed with screen-detected PCa between 1995 and 2010 in the Göteborg randomised, population-based PCa screening trial, 439 were managed with AS and were included in this study. Median age at diagnosis was 65.4 yr of age, and median follow-up was 6.0 yr from diagnosis.  Intervention:   The study participants were followed at intervals of 3-12 mo and were recommended to switch to deferred active treatment in case of a progression in prostate-specific antigen, grade, or stage.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The end points-overall survival (OS), treatment-free survival, failure-free (no relapse after radical treatment) survival, and cancer-specific survival-were calculated for various risk groups (very low, low, intermediate, and high) with Kaplan-Meier estimates. A Cox proportional hazards model as well as a competing risk analysis were used to assess whether risk group or age at diagnosis was associated with failure after AS.  Results and limitations:   Forty-five per cent of all screen-detected PCa were managed with AS, and very low-risk and low-risk PCa constituted 60% of all screen-detected PCa. Thirty-seven per cent (162 of 439) switched from surveillance to deferred active treatment, and 39 men failed AS. The 10-yr OS, treatment-free survival, and failure-free survival were 81.1%, 45.4%, and 86.4%, respectively (Kaplan-Meier estimates). Men with low-, intermediate-, and high-risk tumours had a hazard ratio for failure of 2.1 (p=0.09), 3.6 (p=0.002), and 4.6 (p=0.15), respectively, compared to very low-risk tumours (Cox regression). Only one PCa death occurred, and one patient developed metastasis (both in the intermediate-risk group). The main limitation of this study is the relatively short follow-up.  Conclusions:   A large proportion of men with screen-detected PCa can be managed with AS.

Materials and methods:   Searches of the PubMed and Scopus electronic databases for the terms ""prostate,"" ""cancer,"" ""diffusion-weighted imaging,"" and ""magnetic resonance imaging"" using an end date of December 2010 were completed. All included studies had histopathologic correlation; 2×2 contingency data were constructed for each study. A Bayesian receiver operating characteristic (ROC) model was used across studies to determine sensitivity, specificity, and area under the full or partial ROC curve.  Results:   Nineteen articles consisting of a total of 5892 lesions were analyzed. Based on a 95% credible interval, DWI alone yielded a significantly better area under the ROC curve, sensitivity, and specificity (0.85, 0.69, 0.89, respectively) than T2-weighted imaging alone (0.75, 0.60, 0.76). Combined DWI and T2-weighted imaging (0.73, 0.70, 0.83) showed a similar area under the ROC curve but significantly better sensitivity and specificity than T2-weighted imaging alone. DWI and combined DWI and T2-weighted imaging yielded similar overall sensitivity, but DWI alone showed better overall specificity than combined DWI and T2-weighted imaging. At specificities of greater than 80%, combined DWI and T2-weighted imaging yielded a partial area under the ROC curve (0.138) similar to that of DWI alone (0.129) and was significantly better than the partial area under the ROC curve of T2-weighted imaging alone (0.070). DWI alone and combined DWI and T2-weighted imaging appear to be superior to dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging alone (area under the ROC curve, 0.79; sensitivity, 0.58; specificity, 0.82).

Summary:   An 85-year-old man arrived at the emergency department with complaints of generalized weakness, fatigue, and one episode of dark stool. The patient's medical history included hypertension, heart failure, stage III chronic kidney disease, cerebrovascular accident, prostate cancer, gastritis, esophagitis, diverticulosis, and a bleeding gastrointestinal ulcer. Laboratory test results revealed acute liver failure, acute kidney injury, and anemia. He was diagnosed with hemorrhagic shock secondary to bleeding in his upper gastrointestinal tract. A reversal strategy was implemented using 16 units of FFP and 2000 units of a three-factor PCC. After administration of these agents, the patient's hemoglobin concentration stabilized, and there were no further signs of overt bleeding, suggesting potential hemostasis. Confirmation of this reversal was not possible due to the effect of concomitant liver failure on the International Normalized Ratio and the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), common variables used to measure coagulation.  Conclusion:   Treatment with a PCC and FFP was administered to an 85-year-old man diagnosed with hemorrhagic shock secondary to bleeding in his upper gastrointestinal tract in an effort to reverse the anticoagulant effects of dabigatran. Although the patient's hemoglobin levels stabilized and his aPTT values decreased after treatment, he died as a result of multiorgan failure.""","""['Lisa E Dumkow', 'Johnathan R Voss', 'Michael Peters', 'Douglas L Jennings']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Am J Health Syst Pharm""","""['Clinical experience of life-threatening dabigatran-related bleeding at a large, tertiary care, academic medical center: a case series.', 'Management of dabigatran-associated intracerebral and intraventricular hemorrhage: a case report.', 'Pharmacologic interventions for reversing the effects of oral anticoagulants.', 'Dabigatran for stroke prevention in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation: focus in the geriatric population.', 'The acute management of haemorrhage, surgery and overdose in patients receiving dabigatran.', 'Extensive spontaneous cervical epidural hematoma due to oral anticoagulant (dabigatran) successfully treated with reversal agent idarucizumab alone.', 'Clinical protocols for oral anticoagulant reversal during high risk of bleeding for emergency surgical and nonsurgical settings: a narrative review.', 'Direct-Acting Oral Anticoagulants and Their Reversal Agents-An Update.', 'Direct oral anticoagulants: a review on the current role and scope of reversal agents.', 'Dabigatran must be used carefully: literature review and recommendations for management of adverse events.']"""

Stromal changes have been shown to be powerful prognostic indicators of prostate cancer progression and of patient death helping to define lethal versus indolent phenotypes. The specific molecular underpinnings of these interactions are incompletely understood. We investigated whether stromal cathepsin D (CathD) overexpression affects prostate tumorigenesis through a paracrine mechanism.  Methods:   Normal prostate fibroblasts (NPF) were retrovirally transduced to overexpress cyclin D1 (CD1) and were designated NPF(CD1) . Cathepsin D expression was knocked down using shRNA in cancer associated fibroblasts (CAF) and NPF(CD1) . We analyzed these stromal cell lines using immunohistochemistry, Western blot, and tissue recombination.  Results:   An examination of human prostate tissue revealed significantly increased stromal staining of CathD in malignant prostate tissue. Overexpression of CD1 in normal prostate fibroblasts (NPF(CD1) ) produced a phenotype similar to, but more moderate than, CAF in a tissue recombination model. Knockdown studies revealed that CathD is required for NPF(CD1) motility and invasive growth in vitro. BPH-1 cell proliferation was found to be induced when cultured with NPF(CD1) conditioned medium, this effect was inhibited when CathD was knocked down in NPF(CD1) cells. Overexpression of CathD in prostate stromal cells induced malignancy in adjacent epithelium, and this transformation was inhibited when stromal CathD expression was knocked down in CAF.  Conclusions:   The study presented here demonstrates increased CathD expression is seen in human CAF. The upregulation of CD1 results in concomitant increases in CathD expression. Elevated CathD expression in the stroma contributes to tumor promotion.""","""['Freddie L Pruitt', 'Yue He', 'Omar E Franco', 'Ming Jiang', 'Justin M Cates', 'Simon W Hayward']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Active sonic hedgehog signaling between androgen independent human prostate cancer cells and normal/benign but not cancer-associated prostate stromal cells.', 'Profiling molecular targets of TGF-beta1 in prostate fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transdifferentiation.', 'Tissue-specific consequences of cyclin D1 overexpression in prostate cancer progression.', 'Role of the stromal microenvironment in carcinogenesis of the prostate.', 'Differentiation pathways and histogenetic aspects of normal and abnormal prostatic growth: a stem cell model.', 'Therapeutic Potential of Marine Peptides in Prostate Cancer: Mechanistic Insights.', 'Protein signatures to distinguish aggressive from indolent prostate cancer.', 'Cellular senescence as a possible link between prostate diseases of the ageing male.', 'The converging roles of Batten disease proteins in neurodegeneration and cancer.', ""'Patchiness' and basic cancer research: unravelling the proteases.""]"""

Results of this study may increase understanding of prostate dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) MRI analysis.  Methods:   Radical prostatectomy specimens of 28 patients containing TZT ranging from pT2-pT4 were used. In 11 patients a concomitant peripheral zone tumor (PZT) was present. Microvessels were visualized by CD31 immunohistochemistry. Specimens were scanned using a computer-controlled microscope with automatic recognition of microvessels. Pseudocolor maps were produced displaying microvessel density, perimeter, and area of an entire prostate transection. Mean, 75th percentile (p75) and coefficient of variation (CV) were calculated automatically in manually indicated areas of the tumor and corresponding contralateral normal tissue, and BPH.  Results:   Large variability was seen in TZT microvascular parameters, indicating presence of patients having both hypo and hypervascularized tumors compared to NTZ. In contrast, areas of BPH showed a more consistent increase in vascular parameters, with decreased CV. Analysis of PZT confirmed results of our previous study, with mean and p75 of all vascular parameters being significantly increased and a decrease in CV.

Although tumor growth is controlled at first, the tumor invariably recurs in the form of castration-resistant prostate cancer. This study assessed the efficacy of a new therapeutic strategy that combines plumbagin, a naturally occurring naphthoquinone, with androgen ablation.  Methods:   Viewing microscopy chambers were placed in the dorsal skinfold of mice. Syngeneic prostate tissue was grafted within the chambers and allowed to vascularize. H2B-GFP/PTEN-P2 prostate cancer cells were co-implanted on top of the grafted prostate tissue. Androgen ablation was achieved using surgical castration. Intact and castrated mice were administered plumbagin or sham treatment. Tumor growth, mitosis and apoptosis were monitored in real-time using fluorescent Intra-Vital Microscopy. The mechanism of action of plumbagin was explored using human and mouse prostate cancer cells.  Results:   Whereas both plumbagin and castration alone impeded tumor growth, only the combination of plumbagin and castration caused profound tumor regression in vivo, mostly due to increased apoptosis of the tumor cells. The cytotoxicity of plumbagin was not affected by androgens in vitro, suggesting that microenvironmental factors not present in culture play a crucial role in the combination effect. Plumbagin-induced cell death was mediated, at least in part, by activation of ERK and was due to generation of reactive oxygen species, because it was abolished by the anti-oxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine.  Conclusion:   Androgen deprivation in combination with plumbagin may provide a significant improvement over androgen deprivation alone and deserves further evaluation.""","""['Parisa Abedinpour', 'Véronique T Baron', 'Adrian Chrastina', 'John Welsh', 'Per Borgström']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Plumbagin induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis through reactive oxygen species/c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathways in human melanoma A375.S2 cells.', 'Plumbagin improves the efficacy of androgen deprivation therapy in prostate cancer: A pre-clinical study.', 'Plumbagin (5-hydroxy-2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone) induces apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in A549 cells through p53 accumulation via c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase-mediated phosphorylation at serine 15 in vitro and in vivo.', 'Emerging role of plumbagin: Cytotoxic potential and pharmaceutical relevance towards cancer therapy.', 'Anticancer Properties and Pharmaceutical Applications of Plumbagin: A Review.', 'Propylene Glycol Caprylate-Based Nanoemulsion Formulation of Plumbagin: Development and Characterization of Anticancer Activity.', 'Plumbagin-Loaded Nanoemulsion Drug Delivery Formulation and Evaluation of Antiproliferative Effect on Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Differential gene expression induced by anti-cancer agent plumbagin is mediated by androgen receptor in prostate cancer cells.', 'Induction of apoptosis and autophagy via sirtuin1- and PI3K/Akt/mTOR-mediated pathways by plumbagin in human prostate cancer cells.', 'Plumbagin Inhibits Prostate Carcinogenesis in Intact and Castrated PTEN Knockout Mice via Targeting PKCε, Stat3, and Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition Markers.']"""

However, docetaxel resistance rapidly develops. Identifying the critical mechanisms giving rise to docetaxel resistance is the major challenge in advanced prostate cancer.  Methods:   The effects of docetaxel on human DU145, PC3, LNCaP, and C4-2 prostate cancer cells were examined in cell culture, and p53 expression were analyzed by Western blot analysis. The potential role of p53 in docetaxel sensitivity in prostate cancer cells was tested by either p53 silencing using shRNA or p53 overexpression by introducing wild-type p53.  Results:   We found that DU145 (mutant p53) and PC3 (p53 null) cells were less sensitive than LNCaP and C4-2 cells expressing functional p53 in response to docetaxel. Docetaxel treatment induces considerably higher apoptosis in LNCaP and C4-2 cells than in DU145 and PC3 cells in a dose dependent manner. Docetaxel increases the levels of ser15 phosphorylation of p53 in a dose dependent manner in both LNCaP and C4-2 cells, while has no effect on the levels of ser15 phosphorylation of p53 in DU145 cells. These results suggest that p53 phosphorylation is associated with docetaxel sensitivity in prostate cancer cells. To further confirm whether p53 activation can induce cell sensitivity to docetaxel treatment, we used p53 shRNA to knock down p53 expression in C4-2 cells and determined the cells response to docetaxel treatment. Knockdown of p53 significantly down regulated p53 phosphorylation and blocked docetaxel induced apoptotic cell death compared to the vector control. To further confirm this observation, we established a stable knock out p53 in C4-2 cells. Down regulation of p53 in the stable p53 knock out C4-2 cells significantly inhibited docetaxel induced apoptotic cell death. We also used wild-type (WT) p53 to over express p53 in DU145 cells, and found that expression of WT-p53 in DU145 cells increased their sensitivity to docetaxel.  Conclusions:   These results demonstrate that docetaxel induces p53 phosphorylation and that p53 status is a crucial determinant of docetaxel sensitivity in prostate cancer cells.""","""['Chengfei Liu', 'Yezi Zhu', 'Wei Lou', 'Nagalakshmi Nadiminty', 'Xinbin Chen', 'Qinghua Zhou', 'Xu Bao Shi', 'Ralph W deVere White', 'Allen C Gao']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Resistance to docetaxel-induced apoptosis in prostate cancer cells by p38/p53/p21 signaling.', 'Docetaxel induces Bcl-2- and pro-apoptotic caspase-independent death of human prostate cancer DU145 cells.', 'Lenalidomide enhances the anti-prostate cancer activity of docetaxel in vitro and in vivo.', 'Interferon inducible antiviral MxA is inversely associated with prostate cancer and regulates cell cycle, invasion and Docetaxel induced apoptosis.', 'Paclitaxel and docetaxel resistance in prostate cancer: Molecular mechanisms and possible therapeutic strategies.', 'Novel inhibition of AKR1C3 and androgen receptor axis by PTUPB synergizes enzalutamide treatment in advanced prostate cancer.', 'Synthesis, biological evaluation, and molecular docking of novel hydroxyzine derivatives as potential AR antagonists.', 'The Integration of Metabolomics with Other Omics: Insights into Understanding Prostate Cancer.', 'Activity of New Synthetic (2-Chloroethylthio)-1,4-naphthoquinones in Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Ceramide Regulates Anti-Tumor Mechanisms of Erianin in Androgen-Sensitive and Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancers.']"""

It is unknown whether delaying radical prostatectomy (RP) is associated with increased risk of biochemical recurrence (BCR) for men with intermediate-risk PC.  Methods:   We performed a retrospective analysis of 1,561 low and intermediate-risk men from the Shared Equal Access Regional Cancer Hospital (SEARCH) database treated with RP between 1988 and 2011. Patients were stratified by interval between diagnosis and RP (≤ 3, 3-6, 6-9, or >9 months) and by risk using the D'Amico classification. Cox proportional hazard models were used to analyze BCR. Logistic regression was used to analyze positive surgical margins (PSM), extracapsular extension (ECE), and pathologic upgrading.  Results:   Overall, 813 (52%) men were low-risk, and 748 (48%) intermediate-risk. Median follow-up among men without recurrence was 52.9 months, during which 437 men (38.9%) recurred. For low-risk men, RP delays were unrelated to BCR, ECE, PSM, or upgrading (all P > 0.05). For intermediate-risk men, however, delays >9 months were significantly related to BCR (HR: 2.10, P = 0.01) and PSM (OR: 4.08, P < 0.01). Delays >9 months were associated with BCR in subsets of intermediate-risk men with biopsy Gleason score ≤ 3 + 4 (HR: 2.51, P < 0.01), PSA ≤ 6 (HR: 2.82, P = 0.06), and low tumor volume (HR: 2.59, P = 0.06).  Conclusions:   For low-risk men, delayed RP did not significantly affect outcome. For men with intermediate-risk disease, delays >9 months predicted greater BCR and PSM risk. If confirmed in future studies, this suggests delayed RP for intermediate-risk PC may compromise outcomes.""","""['Michael R Abern', 'William J Aronson', 'Martha K Terris', 'Christopher J Kane', 'Joseph C Presti Jr', 'Christopher L Amling', 'Stephen J Freedland']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Re: Delayed radical prostatectomy for intermediate-risk prostate cancer is associated with biochemical recurrence: possible implications for active surveillance from the SEARCH database.', 'Impact of positive surgical margins on prostate-specific antigen failure after radical prostatectomy in adjuvant treatment-naïve patients.', 'The percentage of prostate needle biopsy cores with carcinoma from the more involved side of the biopsy as a predictor of prostate specific antigen recurrence after radical prostatectomy: results from the Shared Equal Access Regional Cancer Hospital (SEARCH) database.', 'Prognostic significance of a positive surgical margin in pathologically organ-confined prostate cancer.', 'Radical prostatectomy: positive surgical margins matter.', 'Timing of curative treatment for prostate cancer: a systematic review.', 'Suitability of conventional systematic vs. MRI-guided targeted biopsy approaches to assess surgical treatment delay for radical prostatectomy.', 'Impact of delay from transperineal biopsy to radical prostatectomy upon objective measures of cancer control.', 'Protocol for GET FIT Prostate: a randomized, controlled trial of group exercise training for fall prevention and functional improvements during and after treatment for prostate cancer.', 'Waiting Times for Prostate Cancer Diagnosis in a Nigerian Population.', 'Management of Medium and Long Term Complications Following Prostate Cancer Treatment Resulting in Urinary Diversion - A Narrative Review.']"""

Methods:   We examined the consequence of overexpression or RNAi depletion of dystroglycan on properties of in vitro growth migration and invasion of LNCaP, PC3, and DU145 prostate cancer cell lines.  Results:   Using LNCaP cells we observed cell density-dependent changes in β-dystroglycan with the appearance of several lower molecular weight species ranging in size from 43 to 26 kDa. The bands of 31 and 26 kDa were attributed to proteolysis, whereas bands between 43 and 38 kDa were a consequence of mis-glycosylation. The localization of β-dystroglycan in LNCaP colonies in culture also varied, cells with a mesenchymal appearance at the periphery of the colony had more pronounced membrane localization of dystroglycan. Whereas some cells demonstrated nuclear dystroglycan. Increased dystroglycan levels were inhibitory to growth in soft agar but promoted Matrigel invasion, whereas reduced dystroglycan levels promoted growth in soft agar but inhibited invasion. Similar results were also obtained for PC3 and DU145 cells.  Conclusions:   This study suggests that changes in β-dystroglycan distribution within the cell and/or the loss of dystroglycan during tumorigenesis, through a combination of proteolysis and altered glycosylation, leads to an increased ability to grow in an anchorage independent manner, however dystroglycan may need to be re-expressed for cell invasion and metastasis to occur.""","""['A Mitchell', 'G Mathew', 'T Jiang', 'F C Hamdy', 'S S Cross', 'C Eaton', 'S J Winder']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['TGF-β Effects on Prostate Cancer Cell Migration and Invasion Require FosB.', 'Reduced FRG1 expression promotes prostate cancer progression and affects prostate cancer cell migration and invasion.', 'Loss of LARGE2 disrupts functional glycosylation of α-dystroglycan in prostate cancer.', 'Nuclear targeting of dystroglycan promotes the expression of androgen regulated transcription factors in prostate cancer.', 'Expression and functional role of CCR9 in prostate cancer cell migration and invasion.', 'Circular RNA circ-TNRC6B inhibits the proliferation and invasion of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cells by regulating the miR-452-5p/DAG1 axis.', 'Small extracellular vesicles promote invadopodia activity in glioblastoma cells in a therapy-dependent manner.', 'Involvement of abnormal dystroglycan expression and matriglycan levels in cancer pathogenesis.', 'The Duchenne muscular dystrophy gene and cancer.', 'The intracellular domain of β-dystroglycan mediates the nucleolar stress response by suppressing UBF transcriptional activity.']"""

IMRT planning uses strict dose constraints to nearby organs to limit toxicity. Bile acid malabsorption (BAM) is a treatable disorder of the terminal ileum (TI) that presents with symptoms similar to radiation therapy toxicity. It has not been described in patients receiving RT for prostate cancer in the contemporary era. We describe new-onset BAM in men after IMRT for prostate cancer.  Methods and materials:   Diagnosis of new-onset BAM was established after typical symptoms developed, selenium-75 homocholic acid taurine (SeHCAT) scanning showed 7-day retention of <15%, and patients' symptoms unequivocally responded to a bile acid sequestrant. The TI was identified on the original radiation therapy plan, and the radiation dose delivered was calculated and compared with accepted dose-volume constraints.  Results:   Five of 423 men treated in a prospective series of high-dose prostate and pelvic IMRT were identified with new onset BAM (median age, 65 years old). All reported having normal bowel habits before RT. The volume of TI ranged from 26-141 cc. The radiation dose received by the TI varied between 11.4 Gy and 62.1 Gy (uncorrected). Three of 5 patients had TI treated in excess of 45 Gy (equivalent dose calculated in 2-Gy fractions, using an α/β ratio of 3) with volumes ranging from 1.6 cc-49.0 cc. One patient had mild BAM (SeHCAT retention, 10%-15%), 2 had moderate BAM (SeHCAT retention, 5%-10%), and 2 had severe BAM (SeHCAT retention, <5%). The 3 patients whose TI received ≥45 Gy developed moderate to severe BAM, whereas those whose TI received <45 Gy had only mild to moderate BAM.  Conclusions:   Radiation delivered to the TI during IMRT may cause BAM. Identification of the TI from unenhanced RT planning computed tomography scans is difficult and may impede accurate dosimetric evaluation. Thorough toxicity assessment and close liaison between oncologist and gastroenterologist allow timely diagnosis and treatment.""","""['Victoria Harris', 'Barbara Benton', 'Aslam Sohaib', 'David Dearnaley', 'H Jervoise N Andreyev']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['In regard to Harris et al.', 'Are bile acid malabsorption and bile acid diarrhoea important causes of loose stool complicating cancer therapy?', 'SeHCAT tauroselcholic (selenium-75) acid for the investigation of bile acid malabsorption and measurement of bile acid pool loss: a systematic review and cost-effectiveness analysis.', 'Clinical toxicities and dosimetric parameters after whole-pelvis versus prostate-only intensity-modulated radiation therapy for prostate cancer.', 'In regard to Harris et al.', 'Systematic review: the prevalence of idiopathic bile acid malabsorption as diagnosed by SeHCAT scanning in patients with diarrhoea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome.', 'Impact of Pelvic Radiation Therapy for Prostate Cancer on Global Metabolic Profiles and Microbiota-Driven Gastrointestinal Late Side Effects: A Longitudinal Observational Study.', 'An Integrated Multi-Omic Approach to Assess Radiation Injury on the Host-Microbiome Axis.', 'Technical aspects of radiation therapy for anal cancer.', 'Radiation-induced small bowel disease: latest developments and clinical guidance.']"""

Here, we present the final analysis of the study before crossover from placebo to abiraterone acetate (after 775 of the prespecified 797 death events).  Methods:   Between May 8, 2008, and July 28, 2009, this study enrolled 1195 patients at 147 sites in 13 countries. Patients were eligible if they had metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer progressing after docetaxel. Patients were stratified according to baseline Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status, worst pain over the past 24 h on the Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form, number of previous chemotherapy regimens, and type of progression. Patients were randomly assigned (ratio 2:1) to receive either abiraterone acetate (1000 mg, once daily and orally) plus prednisone (5 mg, orally twice daily) or placebo plus prednisone with a permuted block method via an interactive web response system. The primary endpoint was overall survival, analysed in the intention-to-treat population. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00091442.  Findings:   Of the 1195 eligible patients, 797 were randomly assigned to receive abiraterone acetate plus prednisone (abiraterone group) and 398 to receive placebo plus prednisone (placebo group). At median follow-up of 20·2 months (IQR 18·4-22·1), median overall survival for the abiraterone group was longer than in the placebo group (15·8 months [95% CI 14·8-17·0] vs 11·2 months [10·4-13·1]; hazard ratio [HR] 0·74, 95% CI 0·64-0·86; p<0·0001).

Methods:   We analyzed our institutional radical prostatectomy database, including all patients with clinically localized disease treated from 2000 to 2010. Using the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines, the patients were classified into low-, intermediate-, or high-risk groups. The pathologic outcomes were assessed, and the biochemical recurrence (BCR)-free survival rates were calculated and compared using the log-rank test and Cox proportional hazards analysis.  Results:   A total of 12 821 men met the inclusion criteria. The pathologic and 10-year BCR-free survival rates differed significantly by risk group (low risk, 92.1%; intermediate risk, 71.0%; and high risk, 38.8%; P < .01). Among the intermediate-risk men, the 10-year BCR-free survival was significantly greater for men assigned to the intermediate-risk group by clinical stage (88.8%) than for those deemed intermediate risk by the Gleason score (73.6%) or prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level (79.5%; P = .01). Likewise, in the high-risk men, a trend was seen toward improved 5-year BCR-free survival for patients with clinical stage T3a tumors (77.8%) compared with those considered high risk because of the Gleason score (53.7%) or PSA level (41.0%; P = .13). On multivariate analysis, clinical stage, Gleason score, and PSA level were all significantly associated with BCR.  Conclusion:   We observed heterogeneous outcomes among patients within the National Comprehensive Cancer Network intermediate- and high-risk groups. The BCR-free survival rates were superior for men with an advanced clinical stage compared with those with an advanced Gleason score or elevated PSA level.

The purpose of current study was to evaluate any association of sun exposure with risk of prostate cancer in Chinese, Malays and Indians who reside in the tropics.  Methods:   The Singapore Prostate Cancer Study is a hospital-based case-control study of 240 prostate cancer incident cases and 268 controls conducted in Singapore between April 2007 and May 2009.

PARP-1 has well-described functions in DNA damage repair and also functions as a context-specific regulator of transcription factors. With multiple models, data show that PARP-1 elicits protumorigenic effects in androgen receptor (AR)-positive prostate cancer cells, in both the presence and absence of genotoxic insult. Mechanistically, PARP-1 is recruited to sites of AR function, therein promoting AR occupancy and AR function. It was further confirmed in genetically defined systems that PARP-1 supports AR transcriptional function, and that in models of advanced prostate cancer, PARP-1 enzymatic activity is enhanced, further linking PARP-1 to AR activity and disease progression. In vivo analyses show that PARP-1 activity is required for AR function in xenograft tumors, as well as tumor cell growth in vivo and generation and maintenance of castration resistance. Finally, in a novel explant system of primary human tumors, targeting PARP-1 potently suppresses tumor cell proliferation. Collectively, these studies identify novel functions of PARP-1 in promoting disease progression, and ultimately suggest that the dual functions of PARP-1 can be targeted in human prostate cancer to suppress tumor growth and progression to castration resistance.  Significance:   These studies introduce a paradigm shift with regard to PARP-1 function in human malignancy, and suggest that the dual functions of PARP-1 in DNA damage repair and transcription factor regulation can be leveraged to suppress pathways critical for promalignant phenotypes in prostate cancer cells by modulation of the DNA damage response and hormone signaling pathways.

Most of it is present as a free protein but a small part is bound to cysteine-rich secretory protein 3 (CRISP3) as a non-covalent complex. Even though their physiological function is unknown, both MSMB and CRISP3 have been ascribed roles in prostate carcinogenesis. Thus, several recent experimental studies indicate a tumor-suppressor role for MSMB. The present study was undertaken in order to evaluate, for the first time, the expression of MSMB and CRISP3 in ovaries and in ovarian tumors and to determine if their expression might indicate a role in ovarian tumor development.  Materials and methods:   Biopsies from prospectively collected samples from ovaries and benign, borderline and invasive ovarian tumors were analyzed for expression of MSMB and CRISP3 by immunohistochemistry. In patients with ovarian cancer the expression was compared to survival.  Results:   Both MSMB and CRISP3 were strongly stained in ovarian epithelial cells and weakly stained in the stroma. In ovarian blood vessels, CRISP3 exhibited strong to medium staining, while MSMB was only weakly expressed. In benign and borderline tumors the staining pattern was similar to the one observed in the ovaries. In invasive neoplasms, the expression of MSMB in the tumor cells was significantly reduced. In univariate analysis, decreased expression of MSMB correlated to reduced survival. No correlation was found with stage, the strongest prognostic indicator for ovarian cancer, which supports an independent role of MSMB in ovarian carcinogenesis. For CRISP3, a staining pattern comparable to that for MSMB was observed in all groups, except the fact that decreased expression was not observed in invasive tumor cells.  Conclusion:   MSMB and CRISP3 were widely distributed in ovaries and in ovarian tumors; the expression of MSMB fits well with a tumor-suppressor function in ovarian carcinogenesis.""","""['Rudi Henriksen', 'Åke Lundwall', 'Lene Udby', 'Per Fernlund']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Anticancer Res""","""['Effect of androgen deprivation therapy on the expression of prostate cancer biomarkers MSMB and MSMB-binding protein CRISP3.', 'Evaluation of the prognostic significance of MSMB and CRISP3 in prostate cancer using automated image analysis.', 'Expression of serotonin receptors 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, 5-HT2B and 5-HT4 in ovary and in ovarian tumours.', 'The potential value of microseminoprotein-beta as a prostate cancer biomarker and therapeutic target.', 'MSMB variation and prostate cancer risk: clues towards a possible fungal etiology.', 'Discovery and validation of novel biomarkers for detection of cervical cancer.', 'Comparative genomic analysis of primary tumors and paired brain metastases in lung cancer patients by whole exome sequencing: a pilot study.', 'High throughput proteomics identifies a high-accuracy 11 plasma protein biomarker signature for ovarian cancer.']"""

LASS2/TMSG1 could interact with the C subunit of vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase, ATP6V0C) and regulate V-ATPase activity. In an attempt to provide molecular mechanism of the interaction between LASS2/TMSG1 and V-ATPase, we constructed four variant transfectants containing different functional domain of LASS2/TMSG1 and stably transfected the variants to human prostate cancer cell line PC-3M-1E8 cell with high metastatic potential. Results showed that there were no obvious differences of V-ATPase expression among different transfected cells and the control. However, V-ATPase activity and intracellular pH was significantly higher in the variant transfectants with Homeodomain of LASS2/TMSG1 than that in the control using the pH-dependent fluorescence probe BECEF/AM. Immunoprecipitation, immunofluorescence and immuno-electron microscope alone or in combination demonstrated the direct interaction of Homeodomain of LASS2/TMSG1 and ATP6V0C.

Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA)-measured bone mineral density does not assess vertebral fractures (VF). High-resolution micro-magnetic resonance imaging (HR-MRI) assesses bone microarchitecture and provides structural information. To determine if VF identification increased the diagnosis of osteoporosis beyond DXA and if HR-MRI demonstrated skeletal deterioration in men with VF, we cross-sectionally studied 137 men aged ≥ 60 years with nonmetastatic prostate cancer on ADT for ≥ 6 months. Vertebral fracture assessment (VFA) by DXA was confirmed with X-rays. HR-MRI of the wrist included bone volume to total volume (BV/TV), surface density (trabecular plates), surface/curve ratio (plates/rods), and erosion index (higher depicts deterioration). VF were found in 37% of men; the majority were unknown. Seven percent of participants were classified as osteoporotic by hip or spine DXA. Thirty-seven percent of men without osteoporosis by DXA had VF identified, suggesting that 90% of patients with clinical osteoporosis would have been misclassified by DXA alone. By ANOVA comparison across VF grades, the BV/TV, surface density, and spine, hip, and wrist DXA were lower, and erosion index was higher in men with moderate-severe VF compared with lesser grades (all p < 0.05). By unadjusted ROC analysis, the addition of HR-MRI to DXA at the spine, hip, and femoral neck added substantially (AUC increased 0.831 to 0.902, p < 0.05) to prediction of moderate-severe vertebral fracture. HR-MRI indices were associated with spine, hip, and wrist DXA measures (p < 0.01). Longer duration of ADT was associated with lower BV/TV, surface density, and surface/curve ratio (p < 0.05). ADT for men with prostate cancer is associated with silent VF. DXA alone leads to misclassifications of osteoporosis, which can be avoided by VF assessment.

In light of an increasing focus on patient-centered outcomes, innovative and efficient approaches to monitor QOL among prostate cancer survivors are increasingly valuable.  Methods:   Forty prostate cancer survivors less than 1 year post-treatment were enrolled at a university-based cancer center clinic from July through August 2011. We adapted the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) survey, a prostate cancer-specific QOL instrument, for use via personal telephone with interactive voice response. We compared written vs interactive voice response EPIC scores across urinary, sexual, bowel, and vitality domains.  Results:   The median age of respondents was 63 years (range, 41-76 years) and the majority had undergone surgery (97.5%). The entire interactive voice response call was completed by 35 participants (87.5%). Over half of all interactive voice response calls were answered after 2 attempts with a median length of 11.3 minutes. On average, interactive voice response EPIC scores were slightly lower than written scores (-2.1 bowel, P = .05; -4.6 urinary incontinence, P < .01). Test-retest reliability was very high for urinary incontinence (r = .97) and sexual function domains (r = .96). Although mean scores were similar for other domains, their distributions had significant ceiling effects limiting our reliability measure interpretation.

Disease mortality is due primarily to metastatic spread, highlighting the urgent need to identify factors involved in this progression. Activation of the genetic epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) program is implicated as a major contributor of PCa progression. Initiation of EMT confers invasive and metastatic behavior in preclinical models and is correlated with poor clinical prognosis. Extracellular Hsp90 (eHsp90) promotes cell motility and invasion in cancer cells and metastasis in preclinical models, however, the mechanistic basis for its widespread tumorigenic function remains unclear. We have identified a novel and pivotal role for eHsp90 in driving EMT events in PCa. In support of this notion, more metastatic PCa lines exhibited increased eHsp90 expression relative to their lineage-related nonmetastatic counterparts. We demonstrate that eHsp90 promoted cell motility in an ERK and matrix metalloproteinase-2/9-dependent manner, and shifted cellular morphology toward a mesenchymal phenotype. Conversely, inhibition of eHsp90 attenuated pro-motility signaling, blocked PCa migration, and shifted cell morphology toward an epithelial phenotype. Last, we report that surface eHsp90 was found in primary PCa tumor specimens, and elevated eHsp90 expression was associated with increased levels of matrix metalloproteinase-2/9 transcripts. We conclude that eHsp90 serves as a driver of EMT events, providing a mechanistic basis for its ability to promote cancer progression and metastasis in preclinical models. Furthermore, its newly identified expression in PCa specimens, and potential regulation of pro-metastatic genes, supports a putative clinical role for eHsp90 in PCa progression.""","""['Michael W Hance', 'Krystal Dole', 'Udhayakumar Gopal', 'Jessica E Bohonowych', 'Agnieszka Jezierska-Drutel', 'Carola A Neumann', 'Haibo Liu', 'Isla P Garraway', 'Jennifer S Isaacs']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""J Biol Chem""","""['Tumor-secreted Hsp90 subverts polycomb function to drive prostate tumor growth and invasion.', 'Secreted heat shock protein 90 promotes prostate cancer stem cell heterogeneity.', 'A novel extracellular Hsp90 mediated co-receptor function for LRP1 regulates EphA2 dependent glioblastoma cell invasion.', 'MicroRNAs and epithelial-mesenchymal transition in prostate cancer.', 'Profiles of Radioresistance Mechanisms in Prostate Cancer.', 'Multiplex Immunostaining Method to Distinguish HSP Isoforms in Cancer Tissue Specimens.', 'Hsp90 is a potential risk factor for ovarian cancer prognosis: an evidence of a Chinese clinical center.', 'Dialog beyond the Grave: Necrosis in the Tumor Microenvironment and Its Contribution to Tumor Growth.', 'Protein homeostasis in aging and cancer.', 'Role of Moonlighting Proteins in Disease: Analyzing the Contribution of Canonical and Moonlighting Functions in Disease Progression.']"""

A hypothesized determinant of men's adaptation to ED is the degree to which they experience a loss of masculine identity in the aftermath of PCa treatment.  Aims:   The aims of this study were (i) to describe the prevalence of concerns related to diminished masculinity among men treated for localized PCa; (ii) to determine whether diminished masculinity is associated with sexual bother, after controlling for sexual functioning status; and (iii) to determine whether men's marital quality moderates the association between diminished masculinity and sexual bother.  Methods:   We analyzed cross-sectional data provided by 75 men with localized PCa who were treated at one of two cancer centers. Data for this study were provided at a baseline assessment as part of their enrollment in a pilot trial of a couple-based intervention.  Main outcome measures:   The sexual bother subscale from the Prostate Health-Related Quality-of-Life Questionnaire and the Masculine Self-Esteem and Marital Affection subscales from Clark et al's PCa-related quality-of-life scale.  Results:   Approximately one-third of men felt they had lost a dimension of their masculinity following treatment. Diminished masculinity was the only significant, independent predictor of sexual bother, even after accounting for sexual functioning status. The association between diminished masculinity and sexual bother was strongest for men whose spouses perceived low marital affection.  Conclusions:   Diminished masculinity is a prominent, yet understudied concern for PCa survivors. Regardless of functional status, men who perceive a loss of masculinity following treatment may be more likely to be distressed by their ED. Furthermore, its impact on adjustment in survivorship may rely on the quality of their intimate relationships.""","""['Talia Zaider', 'Sharon Manne', 'Christian Nelson', 'John Mulhall', 'David Kissane']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""J Sex Med""","""['Sexual bother following radical prostatectomyjsm.', 'Re-constructing masculinity following radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer.', ""Men's sexual help-seeking and care needs after radical prostatectomy or other non-hormonal, active prostate cancer treatments."", 'Erectile dysfunction, masculinity, and psychosocial outcomes: a review of the experiences of men after prostate cancer treatment.', 'Prostate Cancer From a Sex and Gender Perspective: A Review.', 'Precarious Manhood Beliefs Are Positively Associated with Erectile Dysfunction in Cisgender Men.', 'The impact of hegemonic masculine ideals on self-esteem in prostate cancer patients undergoing androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) compared to ADT-naïve patients.', 'The impact of testicular cancer and its treatment on masculinity: A systematic review.', 'A cross-sectional study on demoralization in prostate cancer patients: the role of masculine self-esteem, depression, and resilience.', 'Coping strategies in active and inactive men with prostate cancer: a qualitative study.']"""

Prostate cancer (PCa) accounts for 12% of newly diagnosed cases of cancer in Europe. It is one of the most frequently diagnosed tumours in the developed world. Since the introduction of prostate specific antigen as a test for early detection of PCa, the rate of diagnosis has increased significantly and specific mortality has reduced in most western countries. Most of the data on the incidence of PCa are obtained from population-based cancer registries which frequently do not cover the whole population. This first national hospital-based PCa registry aims not only to estimate the incidence of the disease but to ascertain the clinical profile of newly diagnosed PCa patients, a useful tool for evaluating the impact of the disease and its socio-health management.  Objectives:   • To estimate the 2010 incidence of prostate cancer (PCa) in Spain. • To describe the clinical profile of newly diagnosed cases using a nationwide hospital-based registry.  Patients and methods:   • This was a national epidemiological observational study in 25 public hospitals with a specific reference population according to the National Health System. • Sociodemographic and clinical variables of all newly diagnosed, histopathologically confirmed PCa cases were collected in 2010, in the area of influence of each centre. Cases diagnosed in private practice were not collected (estimated nearly 10% in Spain). • Data monitoring was external to guarantee quality and homogeneity. • The age-standardized PCa incidence was determined based on the age distribution of the European standard population.  Results:   • In all, 4087 new cases of PCa were diagnosed for a reference population of 4933940 men (21.8% of the Spanish male population). • The estimated age-standardized PCa incidence was 70.75 cases per 100000 men. • Mean age at diagnosis was 69 years; 11.6% of patients presented with tumour-related symptoms and 39.5% with LUTS. Median PSA was 8 ng/mL. Gleason score was ≤ 6 in 56.5%, 7 in 26.7% and >7 in 16.8% of patients. At diagnosis, 89.8% had localized, 6.4% locally advanced and 3.8% metastatic disease.  Conclusions:   • This study on PCa incidence in Spain, a western country with intensive opportunistic PSA screening, shows that PCa is a high incidence tumour, diagnosed close to 70 years, usually asymptomatic. • Almost 40% of cases have low risk disease with a risk of over-diagnosis and over-treatment. • Around 55% of patients with intermediate or high risk disease are candidates for active therapy which may result in a reduction of cancer-specific mortality.""","""['José M Cózar', 'Bernardino Miñana', 'Francisco Gómez-Veiga', 'Alfredo Rodríguez-Antolín', 'Humberto Villavicencio; Urology Units', ' Asociación Española de Urología;Arancha Cantalapiedra', 'Emilio Pedrosa']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['National prostate cancer registry 2010 in Spain.', 'Epidemiological trends in prostate cancer over the last years.', 'The National Prostate Cancer Register in Sweden 1998-2002: trends in incidence, treatment and survival.', 'Detection of prostate cancer: the impact of the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC).', 'Prostate cancer screening (II): is prostate cancer a public health problem?

Methods and materials:   Fifteen patients, five for each group, with cancer of the Head&Neck, pleura, and prostate were enrolled in the study. In addition to the treatment planning CT (pCT) images, one replanning CT (rCT) image set was acquired for each patient during the RT course. Three experienced physicians outlined on the pCT and rCT all the volumes of interest (VOIs). We used three software solutions (VelocityAI 2.6.2 (V), MIM 5.1.1 (M) by MIMVista and ABAS 2.0 (A) by CMS-Elekta) to generate the automatic contouring on the repeated CT. All the VOIs obtained with automatic contouring (AC) were successively corrected manually. We recorded the time needed for: 1) ex novo ROIs definition on rCT; 2) generation of AC by the three software solutions; 3) manual correction of AC.To compare the quality of the volumes obtained automatically by the software and manually corrected with those drawn from scratch on rCT, we used the following indexes: overlap coefficient (DICE), sensitivity, inclusiveness index, difference in volume, and displacement differences on three axes (x, y, z) from the isocenter.  Results:   The time saved by the three software solutions for all the sites, compared to the manual contouring from scratch, is statistically significant and similar for all the three software solutions. The time saved for each site are as follows: about an hour for Head&Neck, about 40 minutes for prostate, and about 20 minutes for mesothelioma. The best DICE similarity coefficient index was obtained with the manual correction for: A (contours for prostate), A and M (contours for H&N), and M (contours for mesothelioma).  Conclusions:   From a clinical point of view, the automated contouring workflow was shown to be significantly shorter than the manual contouring process, even though manual correction of the VOIs is always needed.""","""['Mariangela La Macchia', 'Francesco Fellin', 'Maurizio Amichetti', 'Marco Cianchetti', 'Stefano Gianolini', 'Vitali Paola', 'Antony J Lomax', 'Lamberto Widesott']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Radiat Oncol""","""['Evaluation of a commercial DIR platform for contour propagation in prostate cancer patients treated with IMRT/VMAT.', 'Clinical evaluation of multi-atlas based segmentation of lymph node regions in head and neck and prostate cancer patients.', 'Automatic delineation of on-line head-and-neck computed tomography images: toward on-line adaptive radiotherapy.', 'Practical and technical key challenges in head and neck adaptive radiotherapy: The GORTEC point of view.', 'Vision 20/20: perspectives on automated image segmentation for radiotherapy.', 'Plan Quality Analysis of Automated Treatment Planning Workflow With Commercial Auto-Segmentation Tools and Clinical Knowledge-Based Planning Models for Prostate Cancer.', 'Evaluation of Atlas-based auto-segmentation of liver in MR images for Yttrium-90 selective internal radiation therapy.', 'Evaluating the Effectiveness of Deep Learning Contouring across Multiple Radiotherapy Centres.', 'Comprehensive and clinically accurate head and neck cancer organs-at-risk delineation on a multi-institutional study.', 'Clinical evaluation of deep learning and atlas-based auto-segmentation for critical organs at risk in radiation therapy.']"""

A key principle of TCM is that multiple ingredients in a plant extract are more effective and less toxic than a single purified active ingredient or a purified drug derived from a plant product. Rabdosia rubescens extract (RRE) contains terpenoids and flavonoids, but the most active ingredient within the extract attributed to the inhibition of cancer is the kaurene diterpene, oridonin. In order to research synergy with a complete plant extract, the effects of RRE on the inhibition of prostate cancer cell proliferation were compared to the effects of pure oridonin alone in vitro. Three groups of 8 SCID mice bearing human prostate cancer xenografts (LAPC-4) were administered either RRE containing 0.02 mg/g oridonin, pure oridonin at a dose of 0.02 mg/g, or pure oridonin at a dose of 0.1 mg/g, by gavage for 5 days/week for 4 weeks. RRE and pure oridonin at 0.1 mg/g inhibited tumor growth to a similar extent, while oridonin at a dose of 0.02 mg/g did not. Therefore, in comparison to RRE, five times more pure oridonin was required to obtain equivalent prostate xenograft growth inhibition. Since the nuclear factor-κB signaling pathway and inflammation are implicated in prostate carcinogenesis, gene microarray analysis was conducted and demonstrated activation of genes by RRE that was not evident with oridonin treatment alone. This study demonstrated that genomic methods and xenograft studies are capable of demonstrating the benefits of the synergy of whole plant extracts rather than active ingredients isolated and purified as drugs.""","""['Angela M Wong', 'Yanjung Zhang', 'Kelly Kesler', 'Max Deng', 'Lucas Burhenn', 'David Wang', 'Aune Moro', 'Zhaoping Li', 'David Heber']""","""[]""","""2010""","""None""","""Exp Ther Med""","""['The cytostatic and cytotoxic effects of oridonin (Rubescenin), a diterpenoid from Rabdosia rubescens, on tumor cells of different lineage.', 'Oridonin inhibits aberrant AKT activation in breast cancer.', 'Differential control of growth, cell cycle progression, and expression of NF-kappaB in human breast cancer cells MCF-7, MCF-10A, and MDA-MB-231 by ponicidin and oridonin, diterpenoids from the chinese herb Rabdosia rubescens.', 'Recent advances in oridonin derivatives with anticancer activity.', 'Oridonin and its derivatives for cancer treatment and overcoming therapeutic resistance.', 'Targeting Ovarian Cancer Cell Cytotoxic Drug Resistance Phenotype with Xanthium strumarium L.

We previously reported that the PPAR-γ ligand induces growth arrest in human urological cancer cells through apoptosis. In this study, we evaluated the effects of telmisartan and other ARBs on cell proliferation in renal cell carcinoma (RCC), bladder cancer (BC), prostate cancer (PC) and testicular cancer (TC) cell lines. The inhibitory effects of telmisartan and other ARBs (candesartan, valsartan, irbesartan and losartan) on the growth of the RCC, BC, PC and TC cell lines was investigated using an MTT assay. Flow cytometry and Hoechst staining were used to determine whether the ARBs induced apoptosis. Telmisartan caused marked growth inhibition in the urological cancer cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Urological cancer cells treated with 100 μM telmisartan underwent early apoptosis and DNA fragmentation. However, the other ARBs had no effect on cell proliferation in any of the urological cancer cell lines.

The cases were actively followed-up. Net survival was estimated with the unbiased Pohar-Perme method. The standardized net survival used the international cancer survival standard weights.

In women, it ranged from 91% at 5 years and 88% at 10 years (thyroid) to 10% at 5 years and 7% at 10 years (pancreas). The most frequent cancers had the highest net survivals: 84% at 5 years and 71% at 10 years for prostate and 84% at 5 years and 74% at 10 years for breast cancer. Advanced age was associated with poorer prognosis. In most cancers, the net survivals at 5 and 10 years increased over periods of diagnosis. Net cancer survival is unaffected by mortalities due to other causes. It is the only indicator suitable for comparisons between countries or periods of diagnosis within a given country.

It has been demonstrated that the electronic portal imaging device (EPID) is valuable for transit portal dosimetry verification. Patient related dose differences can emerge at any time during treatment and can be categorized in two types: (1) systematic-appearing repeatedly, (2) random-appearing sporadically during treatment. The aim of this study is to investigate how systematic and random information appears in 2D transit dose distributions measured in the EPID plane over the entire course of a treatment and how this information can be used to examine interfractional trends, building toward a methodology to support adaptive radiotherapy. To create a trend overview of the interfractional changes in transit dose, the predicted portal dose for the different beams is compared to a measured portal dose using a γ evaluation. For each beam of the delivered fraction, information is extracted from the γ images to differentiate systematic from random dose delivery errors. From the systematic differences of a fraction for a projected anatomical structures, several metrics are extracted like percentage pixels with |γ| > 1. We demonstrate for four example cases the trends and dose difference causes which can be detected with this method. Two sample prostate cases show the occurrence of a random and systematic difference and identify the organ that causes the difference. In a lung cancer case a trend is shown of a rapidly diminishing atelectasis (lung fluid) during the course of treatment, which was detected with this trend analysis method. The final example is a breast cancer case where we show the influence of set-up differences on the 2D transit dose. A method is presented based on 2D portal transit dosimetry to record dose changes throughout the course of treatment, and to allow trend analysis of dose discrepancies. We show in example cases that this method can identify the causes of dose delivery differences and that treatment adaptation can be triggered as a result. It provides an important element toward informed decision-making for adaptive radiotherapy.""","""['L C G G Persoon', 'S M J J G Nijsten', 'F J Wilbrink', 'M Podesta', 'J A D Snaith', 'T Lustberg', 'W J C van Elmpt', 'F van Gils', 'F Verhaegen']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['SU-E-J-51: Interfractional Trend Analysis of Dose Discrepancies Based on 2D Portal Dosimetry.', 'Overview of 3-year experience with large-scale electronic portal imaging device-based 3-dimensional transit dosimetry.', 'Routine individualised patient dosimetry using electronic portal imaging devices.', 'A literature review of electronic portal imaging for radiotherapy dosimetry.', 'Anatomical imaging for radiotherapy.', 'Evaluation of automated pre-treatment and transit in-vivo dosimetry in radiotherapy using empirically determined parameters.', 'A\xa0novel approach to SBRT patient quality assurance using EPID-based real-time transit dosimetry : A\xa0step to QA with in vivo EPID dosimetry.', 'First Report of the Clinical Use of a Commercial Automated System for Daily Patient QA Using EPID Exit Images.', 'The effect of respiratory motion on electronic portal imaging device dosimetry.', 'A Feasibility Study for in vivo Dosimetry Procedure in Routine Clinical Practice.']"""

Reduced 5-mC levels in peripheral blood leukocytes have been associated with increased risk of colorectal cancer and adenoma in cross-sectional studies.  Methods:   To minimize disease- and/or treatment-related effects, we studied leukocyte 5-mC levels in prospectively collected blood specimens of 370 cases and 493 controls who were cancer-free at blood collection from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial. Leukocyte 5-mC level was determined by a high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC)/tandem mass spectrometry method and expressed as the relative amount of methyl to total cytosine residues, or %5-mC. We estimated the association between colorectal cancer risk and %5-mC categories by computing ORs and 95% confidence intervals (CI) through logistic regression modeling.  Results:   We observed no dose-dependent association between colorectal cancer and%5-mC categories (lowest vs. highest tertile: OR, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.80-1.63; P(trend) = 0.51). However, among subjects whose 5-mC levels were at the highest tertile, we observed an inverse association between natural folate intake and colorectal cancer (highest tertile of natural folate vs. lowest: OR, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.17-0.71; P(trend) = 0.003; P(interaction) = 0.003).  Conclusions:   This prospective investigation show no clear association between leukocyte 5-mC level and subsequent colorectal cancer risk but a suggestive risk modification between 5-mC level and natural folate intake.

Data regarding patient selection, complication rates and cancer outcomes are scarce. We report the largest, single institution series to date, to our knowledge, of salvage robotic assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy.  Materials and methods:   We reviewed our database of 4,234 patients treated with robotic assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy at Vanderbilt University and identified 34 men who had surgery after the failure of prior definitive ablative therapy. Each patient had biopsy proven recurrent prostate cancer and no evidence of metastases. The primary outcome measure was biochemical failure.  Results:   Median time from primary therapy to salvage robotic assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy was 48.5 months with a median preoperative prostate specific antigen of 3.86 ng/ml. Most patients had Gleason scores of 7 or greater on preoperative biopsy, although 12 (35%) had Gleason 8 or greater disease. After a median followup of 16 months 18% of patients had biochemical failure. The positive margin rate was 26%, of which 33% had biochemical failure after surgery. On univariable analysis there was a significant association between prostate specific antigen doubling time and biochemical failure (HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.60-0.99, p = 0.049) as well as between Gleason score at original diagnosis and biochemical failure (HR 3.49, 95% CI 1.18-10.3, p = 0.023). There were 2 Clavien II-III complications, namely a pulmonary embolism and a rectal laceration. Postoperatively 39% of patients had excellent continence.  Conclusions:   Salvage robotic assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy is safe, with many favorable outcomes compared to open salvage radical prostatectomy series.

Neutropenia in cycle 1 may be a pharmacodynamic marker for docetaxel, which may enable tailored dosing in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).  Patients and methods:   The association of cycle 1 neutropenia with overall survival (OS) was examined post hoc in a randomized phase II trial of 221 men with mCRPC who received docetaxel-prednisone combined with placebo or AT-101 (bcl-2 inhibitor); weekly blood cell counts were performed during the first cycle. Patients from both arms were combined because no outcome and toxicity differences were observed. OS was calculated from randomization by the Kaplan-Meier method, and Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate the association with OS.  Results:   The difference in OS between men with day 8 ≥grade 3 neutropenia and those with ≤grade 2 neutropenia was significant after adjusting for trial stratification factors, pain, and performance status (hazard ratio [HR] 0.64; 2P = .048). Results were similar for logarithmic neutrophil counts adjusted for the risk group based on anemia, visceral metastasis, progression by bone scan and pain (HR 1.18; 2P = .07) for stratification factors (HR 1.20; 2P = .052) or both (HR, 1.20; 2P = .046). Men with ≥grade 3 neutropenia and ≥30% prostate-specific antigen level decline by day 90 had improved OS compared with men exhibiting neither (HR 0.51; 2P = .014).  Conclusions:   For patients with mCRPC who received docetaxel, ≥grade 3 neutropenia on day 8 was prognostic for improved OS, which suggests its utility as a pharmacodynamic marker, in this hypothesis-generating analysis.

Intervention arm men received annual prostate-specific antigen (6 years) and digital rectal exam (4 years). Men were followed for cancer diagnosis and mortality through 13 years. Medical record abstractors confirmed prostate cancer diagnoses, stage and grade. Prostate-specific survival in PLCO cases was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier analysis and proportional hazards modeling. We utilized data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) program to compute expected survival in PLCO and compared this to observed.  Results:   There was no significant difference in prostate-specific survival rates between arms; 10 year survival rates were 94.7% (intervention, n = 4250 cases) versus 93.5% (usual care, n = 3815 cases). Within the intervention arm, cases never screened in PLCO had lower 10 year survival rates (82%) than screen detected or interval (following a negative screen) cases, both around 95.5%.

Objective:   To prospectively evaluate the efficacy and safety of three different doses of radium chloride (Ra 223) in patients with CRPC and bone metastases.  Design, setting, and participants:   In this phase 2 double-blind multicenter study, 122 patients were randomized to receive three injections of Ra 223 at 6-wk intervals, at doses of 25 kBq/kg (n=41), 50 kBq/kg (n=39), or 80 kBq/kg (n=42). The study compared the proportion of patients in each dose group who had a confirmed decrease of ≥ 50% in baseline prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Efficacy was evaluated using blood samples to measure PSA and other tumor markers, recorded skeletal-related events, and pain assessments. Safety was evaluated using adverse events (AEs), physical examination, and clinical laboratory tests. The Jonckheere-Terpstra test assessed trends between groups.  Results and limitations:   The study met its primary end point with a statistically significant dose-response relationship in confirmed ≥ 50% PSA declines for no patients (0%) in the 25-kBq/kg dose group, two patients (6%) in the 50-kBq/kg dose group, and five patients (13%) in the 80-kBq/kg dose group (p=0.0297). A ≥ 50% decrease in bone alkaline phosphatase levels was identified in six patients (16%), 24 patients (67%), and 25 patients (66%) in the 25-, 50-, and 80-kBq/kg dose groups, respectively (p<0.0001). The most common treatment-related AEs (≥ 10%) occurring up to week 24 across all dose groups were diarrhea (21%), nausea (16%), and anemia (14%). No difference in incidence of hematologic events was seen among dose groups. Potential limitations include small patient numbers and differences among dose groups at baseline.  Conclusions:   Ra 223 had a dose-dependent effect on serum markers of CRPC activity, suggesting that control of bone disease with Ra 223 may affect cancer-related outcomes.

TET1 depletion facilitates cell invasion, tumor growth, and cancer metastasis in prostate xenograft models and correlates with poor survival rates in breast cancer patients. Consistently, enforced expression of TET1 reduces cell invasion and breast xenograft tumor formation. Mechanistically, TET1 suppresses cell invasion through its dioxygenase and DNA binding activities. Furthermore, TET1 maintains the expression of tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase (TIMP) family proteins 2 and 3 by inhibiting their DNA methylation. Concurrent low expression of TET1 and TIMP2 or TIMP3 correlates with advanced node status in clinical samples.

Materials and methods:   The expression of 14 miRNAs was evaluated by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in surgical specimens from 30 patients with low grade, noninvasive (pTa) and 30 with high grade, invasive (pT2-3) urothelial carcinoma. Controls were normal bladder tissue from 5 patients who underwent surgical treatment for benign prostatic hyperplasia. Endogenous controls were RNU-43 and RNU-48. miRNA profiles were compared and Kaplan-Meier curves were constructed to analyze disease-free and disease specific survival.  Results:   miR-100 was under expressed in 100% of low grade pTa specimens (p <0.001) and miR-10a was over expressed in 73.3% (p <0.001). miR-21 and miR-205 were over expressed in high grade pT2-3 disease (p = 0.02 and <0.001, respectively). The other miRNAs were present at levels similar to those of normal bladder tissue or under expressed in each tumor group. miR-21 over expression (greater than 1.08) was related to shorter disease-free survival in patients with low grade pTa urothelial carcinoma. Higher miR-10a levels (greater than 2.30) were associated with shorter disease-free and disease specific survival in patients with high grade pT2-3 urothelial carcinoma.  Conclusions:   Four miRNAs were differentially expressed in the 2 urothelial carcinoma groups. miR-100 and miR-10a showed under expression and over expression, respectively, in low grade pTa tumors. miR-21 and miR-205 were over expressed in pT2-3 disease.

In this study, a hyaluronic acid (HA)-based bilayer hydrogel system that not only supports the tumoroid formation from LNCaP prostate cancer (PCa) cells, but also simulates their reciprocal interactions with the tumor-associated stroma was developed and characterized. HA hydrogels were prepared by mixing solutions of HA precursors functionalized with acrylate groups (HA-AC) and reactive thiols (HA-SH) under physiological conditions. The resultant viscoelastic gels have an average elastic modulus of 234 ± 30 Pa and can be degraded readily by hyaluronidase. The orthogonal and cytocompatible nature of the crosslinking chemistry permits facile incorporation of cytokine-releasing particles and PCa cells. In our bilayer hydrogel construct, the top layer contains heparin (HP)-decorated, HA-based hydrogel particles (HGPs) capable of releasing heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB-EGF) in a sustained manner at a rate of 2.5 wt%/day cumulatively. LNCaP cells embedded in the bottom layer receive the growth factor signals from the top, and in response form enlarging tumoroids with an average diameter of 85 μm by day 7. Cells in 3D hydrogels assemble into spherical tumoroids, form close cellular contacts through E-cadherin, and show cortical organization of F-actin, whereas those plated as 2D monolayers adopt a spread-out morphology. Compared to cells cultured on 2D, the engineered tumoroids significantly increased the expression of two pro-angiogenic factors, vascular endothelial growth factor-165 (VEGF(165)) and interleukin-8 (IL-8), both at mRNA and protein levels. Overall, the HA model system provides a useful platform for the study of tumor cell responses to growth factors and for screening of anticancer drugs targeting these pathways.""","""['Xian Xu', 'Lisa A Gurski', 'Chu Zhang', 'Daniel A Harrington', 'Mary C Farach-Carson', 'Xinqiao Jia']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Biomaterials""","""['Biomimetic Hydrogels Incorporating Polymeric Cell-Adhesive Peptide To Promote the 3D Assembly of Tumoroids.', 'A double-network poly(Nɛ-acryloyl L-lysine)/hyaluronic acid hydrogel as a mimic of the breast tumor microenvironment.', 'Heparin-hyaluronic acid hydrogel in support of cellular activities of 3D encapsulated adipose derived stem cells.', 'Hyaluronic acid-based hydrogels to study cancer cell behaviors.', 'Tumor spheroid assembly on hyaluronic acid-based structures: A review.', '3D-Printed Tumor-on-Chip for the Culture of Colorectal Cancer Microspheres: Mass Transport Characterization and Anti-Cancer Drug Assays.', 'HYDRHA: Hydrogels of hyaluronic acid.

Using data from the American Health Planning Association, we sorted the health service areas (HSAs) according to the stringency of certificate of need regulations (low vs high) in that market. We assessed our outcomes (ie, the probability of intensity-modulated radiotherapy adoption and intensity-modulated radiotherapy use in the HSAs) using Cox proportional hazards and Poisson regression models, respectively.  Results:   The low- and high-stringency markets were similar in terms of racial composition (80% vs 85% white, P = .08), population density (1085 vs 558 people/square mile, P = .08), and income (median $38 683 vs $40 309, P = .44). However, the low-stringency markets had more patients with stage T1 disease (45% vs 36%, P < .01). The probability of intensity-modulated radiotherapy adoption across the 2 groups of HSAs was similar (P = .65). However, among the adopting HSAs, those with high stringency consistently had greater use of intensity-modulated radiotherapy (P < .01).  Conclusion:   The certificate of need regulations fail to create significant barriers to entry for intensity-modulated radiotherapy. Among the HSAs that acquired intensity-modulated radiotherapy, high-stringency markets demonstrated a greater propensity for using intensity-modulated radiotherapy.

Injecting a spacer between Denonvilliers' fascia increases the distance between the prostate and the anterior rectal wall and may thus decrease the rectal radiation-induced toxicity. We assessed the dosimetric impact of this spacer with advanced delivery RT techniques, including intensity modulated RT (IMRT), volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT), and intensity modulated proton beam RT (IMPT).  Methods and materials:   Eight prostate cancer patients were simulated for RT with or without spacer. Plans were computed for IMRT, VMAT, and IMPT using the Eclipse treatment planning system using both computed tomography spacer+ and spacer- data sets. Prostate ± seminal vesicle planning target volume [PTV] and organs at risk (OARs) dose-volume histograms were calculated. The results were analyzed using dose and volume metrics for comparative planning.  Results:   Regardless of the radiation technique, spacer injection decreased significantly the rectal dose in the 60- to 70-Gy range. Mean V(70 Gy) and V(60 Gy) with IMRT, VMAT, and IMPT planning were 5.3 ± 3.3%/13.9 ± 10.0%, 3.9 ± 3.2%/9.7 ± 5.7%, and 5.0 ± 3.5%/9.5 ± 4.7% after spacer injection. Before spacer administration, the corresponding values were 9.8 ± 5.4% (P=.012)/24.8 ± 7.8% (P=.012), 10.1 ± 3.0% (P=.002)/17.9 ± 3.9% (P=.003), and 9.7 ± 2.6% (P=.003)/14.7% ± 2.7% (P=.003). Importantly, spacer injection usually improved the PTV coverage for IMRT. With this technique, mean V(70.2 Gy) (P=.07) and V(74.1 Gy) (P=0.03) were 100 ± 0% to 99.8 ± 0.2% and 99.1 ± 1.2% to 95.8 ± 4.6% with and without Spacer, respectively.

Over the last decade, short tandem repeat (STR) analysis has emerged as a DNA-based method with clinical applicability for specimen identity testing (also known as specimen provenance testing). Although the clinical utility of identity testing using STR-based analysis has been demonstrated in many studies, its economic value has not been established.  Methods:   We developed a decision-analytic model of the application of STR-based provenance testing of transrectal prostate biopsy specimens obtained as part of routine clinical care to rule out the presence of adenocarcinoma of the prostate, as compared with no STR-based testing. Using parameter values drawn from the published literature, the cost-effectiveness of STR-based testing was quantified by calculating the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio per quality-adjusted life-year gained.  Results:   In comparison to the current standard practice of no identity testing, identity testing by STR-based analysis has an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $65,570 per quality-adjusted life-year gained at a testing cost of $618 per person. At a cost of $515 per person, identity testing would meet the conservative standard of $50,000 per quality-adjusted life-year. At a test cost of $290 per person, identity testing would be cost saving.  Conclusion:   Given the rapidly declining pricing of STR-based identity testing, it is likely that testing to confirm the identity of positive prostate biopsy samples will be a cost-effective method for preventing treatment errors stemming from misidentification. Studies to formally establish the frequency of specimen provenance errors in routine clinical practice would therefore seem justified.""","""['John D Pfeifer', 'Michael N Singleton', 'Martin H Gregory', 'Dennis L Lambert', 'Steven M Kymes']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Value Health""","""['Cost analysis of ultrasound-guided transrectal needle biopsy in prostatic carcinoma.', 'The changing spectrum of DNA-based specimen provenance testing in surgical pathology.', 'The clinical and economic implications of specimen provenance complications in diagnostic prostate biopsies.', 'Rate of occult specimen provenance complications in routine clinical practice.', 'Short tandem repeat profiling: part of an overall strategy for reducing the frequency of cell misidentification.']"""

Selective detection of prostate cancer with increased microvessel density is possible with contrast enhanced ultrasound. Preliminary studies suggest that pretreatment with a 5α-reductase inhibitor may improve the efficiency of contrast enhanced ultrasound targeted biopsy. This study was designed to quantify prostate cancer detection with contrast enhanced ultrasound with or without short-term pretreatment with dutasteride.  Materials and methods:   In this randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trial of oral dutasteride pretreatment, contrast enhanced ultrasound findings were graded and used to direct targeted biopsy (up to 6 cores per prostate). A blinded 12-core systematic biopsy was subsequently performed on every subject based on standard medial and lateral sampling of each sextant.  Results:   Of 311 subjects who underwent randomization, 272 completed participation. Positive biopsies were obtained in 276 of 3,264 (8.5%) systematic cores and 203 of 1,237 (16.4%) targeted cores (OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.7-2.6, p <0.001). ROC analysis for the detection of all prostate cancers demonstrated an increase in diagnostic accuracy from pre-contrast imaging to contrast enhanced ultrasound (A(z) 0.60 vs 0.64, p = 0.005). For the detection of high grade cancer (Gleason score 7 or greater) ROC analysis demonstrated improved accuracy for pre-contrast imaging (A(z) 0.74) and contrast enhanced ultrasound (A(z) 0.80, p = 0.0005). For the detection of high grade cancer with greater than 50% biopsy core involvement, excellent accuracy was demonstrated with pre-contrast and contrast enhanced ultrasound, A(z) 0.83 and 0.90, respectively (p = 0.001).

Survival after biochemical recurrence was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to analyze clinicopathological variables associated with systemic progression after biochemical recurrence.  Results:   Overall, 41 patients (31.5%) with biochemical recurrence experienced systemic progression and 57 (42.5%) died, including 19 (14.2%) of prostate cancer. Median systemic progression-free and cancer specific survival were not attained at 15 years of followup after biochemical recurrence. Median time from prostatectomy to recurrence was 3.3 years. Ten-year cancer specific survival was not significantly different for patients who experienced biochemical recurrence less and greater than 3.3 years after radical prostatectomy (83% and 83%, respectively, p = 0.39).

Cox regression was performed to assess factors associated with post-prostatectomy continence and biochemical recurrence-free survival.  Results:   Median followup for bladder neck sparing vs nonsparing was 25.8 vs 51.7 months.

We investigated the value of the PCA3 (prostate cancer gene 3) urine test in predicting the likelihood of diagnosis of cancer before biopsy.  Materials and methods:   We performed a prospective, community based clinical trial to evaluate PCA3 score before any biopsy. This trial was conducted at 50 urology practices in the United States.

The traditional PCA3 cutoff of 35 reduced the number of false-positives from 1,089 to 249, a 77.1% reduction. However, false-negatives (missed cancers) increased significantly from 17 to 413, an increase of more than 2,300%. Lowering the PCA3 cutoff to 10 reduced the number of false-positives 35.4% and false-negatives only increased 5.6%.

Patients and methods:   • Among 42,376 men randomised during the period of the first round of the trial (1993-1999), 1151 and 210 in the screening and control arms were diagnosed with prostate cancer, respectively. • Of these men, 420 (36.5%) screen-detected and 54 (25.7%) controls underwent RP with long-term follow-up data (median follow-up 9.9 years). • Progression-free (PFS), metastasis-free (MFS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) rates were examined, and multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to determine whether screen-detected (vs control) was associated with RP outcomes after adjusting for standard predictors.  Results:   • RP cases from the screening and control arms had statistically similar clinical stage and biopsy Gleason score, although screen-detected cases had significantly lower prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels at diagnosis. • Men from the screening arm had a significantly higher PFS (P = 0.003), MFS (P < 0.001) and CSS (P = 0.048). • In multivariable models adjusting for age, PSA level, clinical stage, and biopsy Gleason score, the screening group had a significantly lower risk of biochemical recurrence (hazard ratio [HR] 0.43, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.23-0.83, P = 0.011) and metastasis (HR 0.18, 95% CI 0.06-0.59, P = 0.005). • Additionally adjusting for tumour volume and other RP pathology features, there was no longer a significant difference in biochemical recurrence between the screening and control arms. • Limitations of the present study include lead-time bias and non-randomised treatment selection.  Conclusions:   • After RP, screen-detected cases had significantly improved PFS, MFS and CSS compared with controls within the available follow-up time. • The screening arm remained significantly associated with lower rates of biochemical recurrence and metastasis after adjusting for other preoperative variables. • However, considering also RP pathology, the improved outcomes in the screening group appeared to be mediated by a significantly lower tumour volume.""","""['Stacy Loeb', 'Xiaoye Zhu', 'Fritz H Schroder', 'Monique J Roobol']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Radical prostatectomy improves progression-free and cancer-specific survival in men with lymph node positive prostate cancer in the prostate-specific antigen era: a confirmatory study.', 'Radical prostatectomy represents an effective treatment in patients with specimen-confined high pathological Gleason score prostate cancer.', 'Impact of positive surgical margins on prostate-specific antigen failure after radical prostatectomy in adjuvant treatment-naïve patients.', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen-Based Screening for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Evidence Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.', 'Long-term oncological outcomes after laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.', 'The Patient Journey from Randomization to Detection of Prostate Cancer and Death: Results from ERSPC Rotterdam.', 'The presence of prostate-specific antigen checked more than 1 year before diagnostic biopsy is an independent prognostic factor in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy.', 'Clinical outcomes associated with prostate cancer conspicuity on biparametric and multiparametric MRI: a protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis of biochemical recurrence following radical prostatectomy.', 'A Novel Predictor Tool of Biochemical Recurrence after Radical Prostatectomy Based on a Five-MicroRNA Tissue Signature.', 'Prostate Cancer Screening.']"""

Methods:   We conducted a retrospective cohort study within Kaiser Permanente Southern California, a large integrated health care system. Men aged 35 years and older at baseline, in 1998, were eligible. The proportion of men who underwent PSA screening was estimated and compared across groups defined by patient and physician characteristics. We also evaluated trends in screening across time and serum PSA levels for all subgroups.  Results:   Of 2,061,047 men, 572,306 (28%) underwent PSA screening from 1998 through 2007. Patterns of PSA screening varied modestly by age, race, and physician. The lowest frequencies of screening occurred among men younger than age 45 years (19%) and men ages 85 years and older (13%). PSA screening was most common among white men (33.5%) and in men seen by physicians of the same race/ethnicity (32%), compared with men with physicians of disparate race/ethnicity (26%, p < 0.001). PSA screening increased over time for all racial/ethnic groups and among men age 75 years and older but decreased over time for men younger than age 75 years old.  Conclusions:   Nearly 1 in 4 eligible men underwent PSA screening from 1998 through 2007, and screening varied only modestly by patient and physician characteristics. Estimates of the frequency of PSA screening in general-practice settings can inform the debate and provide useful insight as to how changes in cancer screening guidelines would alter practice patterns in an increasingly integrated health care environment.""","""['Lauren Wallner', 'Stanley Frencher', 'Jin-Wen Hsu', 'Ronald Loo', 'Joice Huang', 'Michael Nichol', 'Steven Jacobsen']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Perm J""","""['Prostate cancer screening practices in a large, integrated health system: 2007-2014.', 'Contemporary National Trends of Prostate Cancer Screening Among Privately Insured Men in the United States.', 'Cost implications of PSA screening differ by age.', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA)-Based Population Screening for Prostate Cancer: An Economic Analysis.', 'The effect of the USPSTF PSA screening recommendation on prostate cancer incidence patterns in the USA.', 'Fatal prostate cancer incidence trends in the United States and England by race, stage, and treatment.', 'Digital Rectal Examination for Prostate Cancer Screening in Primary Care: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'Is anyone listening?

Mechanism dissection revealed that the differential methylation pattern in the AR promoter could be due to differential expression of methyltransferases and binding of methylation binding protein to the AR promoter region. The low expression of AR in normal prostate/PCa stem/progenitor cells was reversed after adding 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, a demethylating agent, which could then lead to decreased stemness and drive cells into a more differentiated status, suggesting that the methylation in the AR promoter of prostate stem/progenitor cells is critical not only in maintaining the stemness but also critical in protection of cells from differentiation. Furthermore, induced AR expression, via alteration of its methylation pattern, led to suppression of the self-renewal/proliferation of prostate stem/progenitor cells and PCa tumorigenesis in both in vitro assays and in vivo orthotopic xenografted mouse studies. Taken together, these data prove the unique methylation pattern of AR promoter in normal prostate/PCa stem/progenitor cells and the influence of AR on their renewal/proliferation and differentiation.

The established method for the generation of DUB probes makes use of labor-intensive intein-based methods that have inherent limitations concerning the incorporation of unnatural amino acids and the amount of material that can be obtained. Here, we describe the total chemical synthesis of active-site-directed probes and their application to activity-based profiling and identification of functional DUBs. This synthetic methodology allowed the easy incorporation of desired tags for specific applications, for example, fluorescent reporters, handles for immunoprecipitation or affinity pull-down, and cleavable linkers. Additionally, the synthetic method can be scaled up to provide significant amounts of probe. Fluorescent ubiquitin probes allowed faster, in-gel detection of active DUBs, as compared to (immuno)blotting procedures. A biotinylated probe holding a photocleavable linker enabled the affinity pull-down and subsequent mild, photorelease of DUBs.

We investigated the impact of nuclear and cytoplasmic IGFBP-3 protein expression levels in PCa by examining their in situ expression across a wide spectrum of primary tumors by immunohistochemical analysis of tissue microarrays. Immunohistochemistry was performed on PCa microarrays constructed from 226 hormone naïve patients who underwent radical prostatectomy. Both cytoplasmic and nuclear IGFBP-3 expressions were scored in a semi-quantitative fashion using an integrated measure of intensity and positivity. The distribution of IGFBP-3 protein expression was examined across the spectrum of epithelial tissues, and its association with standard clinicopathological covariates and tumor recurrence was examined. There was a broad range of IGFBP-3 staining across all histologies examined. Tumor had higher IGFBP-3 cytoplasmic and nuclear staining than benign histologies. For IGFBP-3 nuclear staining, PCa was significantly different than benign prostatic hyperplasia, normal prostate, and prostate intraepithelial neoplasia. As both a continuous and dichotomized variable, higher nuclear IGFBP-3 expression had statistically significant associations with PCa recurrence. The cytoplasmic staining had no significance in any patient subgroup. In patients with low-grade cancer, IGFBP-3 nuclear positivity was a better predictor of recurrence than baseline PSA, tumor margin status, TNM tumor stage, or presence of capsular invasion. High nuclear IGFBP-3 is amongst the strongest predictors of cancer recurrence in patients with low-grade prostate cancers and may therefore play an important role in risk stratification.""","""['David B Seligson', 'Hong Yu', 'Sheila Tze', 'Jonathan Said', 'Allan J Pantuck', 'Pinchas Cohen', 'Kuk-Wha Lee']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Horm Cancer""","""['Expression of insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 before and after neoadjuvant hormonal therapy in human prostate cancer tissues: correlation with histopathologic effects and biochemical recurrence.', 'Quantitative immunohistochemical analysis of insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 in human prostatic adenocarcinoma: a prognostic study.', 'SIGIRR/TIR8, an important regulator of TLR4 and IL-1R-mediated NF-κB activation, predicts biochemical recurrence after prostatectomy in low-grade prostate carcinomas.', 'Tissue-Based MicroRNAs as Predictors of Biochemical Recurrence after Radical Prostatectomy: What Can We Learn from Past Studies?', 'Does milk intake promote prostate cancer initiation or progression via effects on insulin-like growth factors (IGFs)?

Materials and methods:   Forty-eight patients underwent multiparametric MR imaging (MRI) on a 3 T system using a phased array body coil and spine coil elements for signal detection before prostatectomy. The examination included T2-weighted imaging (T2WI), diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging (DCE-MRI), and MR spectroscopic imaging (MRSI). Histopathology slides were correlated to T2W images and a stringent matching procedure was performed to define cancer and noncancer areas of the peripheral zone without influence of the MR image appearance. Mean T2W signal intensity, apparent diffusion coefficient, area under the enhancement curve, and choline + creatine-to-citrate signal ratio were calculated for cancer and noncancer areas. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed on MR-derived parameters from the selected areas. Logistic regression was used to create models based on best combination of parameters. A simplified approach assigning a parametric score to each segment based on cutoff values from ROC analysis was also explored.  Results:   By using the stringent matching procedure, 138 noncancer and 41 cancer segments were selected in the T2W images and transferred to the images of the other MR methods. A significant difference between mean values in cancer and noncancer segments was observed for all MR parameters analyzed (P < 0.001). Apparent diffusion coefficient was the best performing single parameter, with an area under the ROC curve Az,DWI of 0.90 for prostate cancer detection. Any combination of T2WI, DWI, and DCE-MRI was significantly better than T2WI alone in separating cancer from noncancer segments (Az,T2WI + DWI + DCE-MRI = 0.94, Az,T2WI + DWI = 0.92, Az,T2WI + DCE-MRI = 0.91, Az,T2WI = 0.85). The combination of T2WI and MRSI was also better than T2WI alone (Az, T2WI + MRSI = 0.90); however, the logistic regression models including MRSI did not have significant parameters. The simplified approach combining all parameters gave similar results to logistic regression combining all parameters (Az = 0.95 and 0.97, respectively).

We analyzed our experience with this surgical approach. A secondary aim was to evaluate the surgical outcome of energy ablative rectourethral fistulas without a concomitant interposition muscle flap.  Materials and methods:   We identified all patients with rectourethral fistula who underwent rectal sphincter preserving transperineal repair from 1998 to 2011. Re-approximation of the urethral mucosa, posterior anastomotic urethroplasty or partial/total prostatectomy with urethrovesical anastomosis was performed for urinary closure. The fistula cohort was divided into 2 groups, including postoperative and energy ablative fistulas, respectively. Success after perineal rectourethral fistula repair was defined as resolution after the first attempt at repair.  Results:   A total of 23 patients underwent rectal sphincter preserving, transperineal rectourethral fistula repair. In the postoperative fistula cohort the fistula was successfully resolved in all 10 patients. A dartos interposition muscle flap was used in 2 of 10 patients. In the energy ablative cohort the fistula was successfully closed in 8 of 13 patients. An interposition muscle flap was not placed in 8 patients with an energy ablative fistula, of whom success was achieved in 5. Two of the 5 patients with an energy ablative fistula and a successful outcome without a concomitant interposition muscle flap had urinary extravasation, necessitating temporary catheterization.  Conclusions:   Rectal sphincter preserving transperineal repair is a successful surgical method to repair postoperative and energy ablative rectourethral fistulas.

Frequently, growing prostatic tumor cells extend beyond the prostatic organ towards this fat depot. This study aimed to determine the genome-wide expression of genes in PP adipose tissue in obesity/overweight (OB/OW) and prostate cancer patients.  Methods:   Differentially expressed genes in human PP adipose tissue were identified using microarrays. Analyses were conducted according to the donors' body mass index characteristics (OB/OW versus lean) and prostate disease (extra prostatic cancer versus organ confined prostate cancer versus benign prostatic hyperplasia). Selected genes with altered expression were validated by real-time PCR. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) was used to investigate gene ontology, canonical pathways and functional networks.  Results:   In the PP adipose tissue of OB/OW subjects, we found altered expression of genes encoding molecules involved in adipogenic/anti-lipolytic, proliferative/anti-apoptotic, and mild immunoinflammatory processes (for example, FADS1, down-regulated, and LEP and ANGPT1, both up-regulated). Conversely, in the PP adipose tissue of subjects with prostate cancer, altered genes were related to adipose tissue cellular activity (increased cell proliferation/differentiation, cell cycle activation and anti-apoptosis), whereas a downward impact on immunity and inflammation was also observed, mostly related to the complement (down-regulation of CFH). Interestingly, we found that the microRNA MIRLET7A2 was overexpressed in the PP adipose tissue of prostate cancer patients.  Conclusions:   Obesity and excess adiposity modified the expression of PP adipose tissue genes to ultimately foster fat mass growth. In patients with prostate cancer the expression profile of PP adipose tissue accounted for hypercellularity and reduced immunosurveillance.

The National Cancer Institute-funded Chicago Patient Navigation Research Program (C-PNRP) aims to implement and evaluate the efficacy of a patient navigation intervention for predominantly low-income minority patients with an abnormal prostate cancer screening test at a Veterans Affairs (VA) hospital in Chicago.  Methods/design:   From 2006 through 2010, C-PNRP implemented a quasi-experimental intervention whereby trained social worker and lay health navigators worked with veterans with an abnormal prostate screen to proactively identify and resolve personal and systems barriers to care. Men were enrolled at a VA urology clinic and were selected to receive navigated versus usual care based on clinic day. Patient navigators performed activities to facilitate timely follow-up such as appointment reminders, transportation coordination, cancer education, scheduling assistance, and social support as needed. Primary outcome measures included time (days) from abnormal screening to diagnosis and time from diagnosis to treatment initiation. Secondary outcomes included psychosocial and demographic predictors of non-compliance and patient satisfaction. Dates of screening, follow-up visits, and treatment were obtained through chart audit, and questionnaires were administered at baseline, after diagnosis, and after treatment initiation. At the VA, 546 patients were enrolled in the study (245 in the navigated arm, 245 in the records-based control arm, and 56 in a subsample of surveyed control subjects).  Discussion:   Given increasing concerns about balancing better health outcomes with lower costs, careful examination of interventions aimed at reducing healthcare disparities attain critical importance.

Between January 2001 and March 2011, at ten patients with prostate cancer the clinical target volumes (CTVs) for prostate (CTV-PROS), and prostate plus caudal 1 cm of seminal vesicles (CTV-PVS) with or without pelvic lymph node region were contoured on the treatment planning CT, according to risk category of the patient. Planning target volumes (PTVs) were created with 1 cm margin extended around the CTVs in each direction. The isocentre was marked on the skin with three radiopaque markers. After the set up, treatment couch with the patient was turned by 180 degree and images were acquired of the region of the isocentre with a kV helical CT-on-rails system (treatment CT). An image registration software was used to co-register planning and treatment CT images. Automatic CT image co-registration was followed by manual co-registration taking into account the CTV-PROS contour and soft tissue informations. Deviations of the isocentres in lateral (LAT), longitudinal (LONG) and vertical (VERT) directions were recorded after each image co-registration. Corresponding data were compared using the t-probe. Systematic (S) and random (s) errors of the set up were calculated. Adequate PTV to CTV margins were calculated by van Herk's formula (2.5xS + 0,7xs). Overall 252 deviations were analysed on fourty-two CT series of 10 patients. The mean errors of the set up with automatic and manual image co-registrations were 0.19 cm and 0.07 cm (p=0.001) in LAT, 0.05 cm and 0.03 cm (p=0.07) in LONG and 0.16 cm and 0.22 cm (p=0.16) in VERT directions, respectively. The systematic errors of the set up for automatic and manual image registrations were 0.22 cm and 0.26 cm in LAT, 0.17 cm and 0.18 cm in LONG, 0.25 cm and 0.26 cm in VERT directions, respectively. The random errors of the set up for automatic and manual image registrations were 0.31 cm and 0.26 cm in LAT, 0.27 cm and 0.27 cm in LONG and 0.24 cm and 0.33 cm in VERT directions, respectively. In case of manual image co-registration, the required PTV to CTV margins to cover at least 95% of the CTVs with at least 95% percent of the prescribed dose were calculated to 0.93 cm in LAT, 0.65 cm in LONG, and 0.89 cm in VERT directions. Patients set up can be verified with manual image co-registration based on soft tissues around the prostate using a kV CT-on-rails system installed in the treatment room. The difference between automatic and manual image co-registration was significant in LAT direction. A PTV to CTV margin <1 cm seems to be appropriate to cover the CTVs in image-guided prostate radiotherapy.

The purpose of this study is to project prostate cancer mortality under active surveillance followed by radical prostatectomy versus under immediate radical prostatectomy.  Experimental design:   A simulation model was developed to combine information on time from diagnosis to treatment under active surveillance and associated disease progression from a Johns Hopkins active surveillance cohort (n = 769), time from radical prostatectomy to recurrence from cases in the CaPSURE database with T-stage ≤ T2a (n = 3,470), and time from recurrence to prostate cancer death from a T-stage ≤ T2a Johns Hopkins cohort of patients whose disease recurred after radical prostatectomy (n = 963). Results were projected for a hypothetical cohort aged 40 to 90 years with low-risk prostate cancer (T-stage ≤ T2a, Gleason score ≤ 6, and prostate-specific antigen level ≤ 10 ng/mL).  Results:   The model projected that 2.8% of men on active surveillance and 1.6% of men with immediate radical prostatectomy would die of their disease in 20 years. Corresponding lifetime estimates were 3.4% for active surveillance and 2.0% for immediate radical prostatectomy. The average projected increase in life expectancy associated with immediate radical prostatectomy was 1.8 months. On average, the model projected that men on active surveillance would remain free of treatment for an additional 6.4 years relative to men treated immediately.

Identification of cancer-regulated microRNAs or other classes of endogenous small RNAs have advanced our knowledge in cancer progression and metastasis. Among many tools, small RNA cloning is a powerful method to identify new microRNAs (miRNAs) and to profile miRNA expression and function. Retroviral system is also the minimum requirement for the studying of miRNAs in a highly stable population of cancer cells or other primary cell types with high expression. This chapter describes a step-by-step protocol that is optimized to clone directly one of the miRNA miR-145, as an example, from genomic DNA into retroviral vector to yield ultimate overexpression for functional study in prostate cancer cells. The small RNAs cloned by this protocol will have an easy and simple way of cloning from genomic DNA to maintain the necessary motifs of native enhancer for enhancement of mature miRNA expression. Furthermore, the procedure eliminates miRNA extraction and cDNA synthesis before cloning and sequential cloning of more than one miRNA makes this protocol cost- and time-effective to eliminate many frequent cell culturing.""","""['Abdol Hossein Rezaeian', 'Yuan Gao', 'Hui-Kuan Lin']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Methods Mol Biol""","""['miRNA and shRNA expression vectors based on mRNA and miRNA processing.', 'Transgene-like animal models using intronic microRNAs.', 'Lentiviral overexpression of miRNAs.', 'Regulation of the MIR155 host gene in physiological and pathological processes.', 'Disruption of microRNA nuclear transport in human cancer.', 'Improving miRNA Delivery by Optimizing miRNA Expression Cassettes in Diverse Virus Vectors.', 'A hypoxia-responsive TRAF6-ATM-H2AX signalling axis promotes HIF1α activation, tumorigenesis and\xa0metastasis.']"""

Gemcitabine is an analogue of pyrimidine cytosine and functions as an anti-metabolite. Structurally, however, gemcitabine has similarities to 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine (decitabine/Dacogen®), a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi). NSCLC, mesothelioma and prostate cancer cell lines were treated with decitabine and gemcitabine. Reactivation of epigenetically silenced genes was examined by RT-PCR/qPCR. DNA methyltransferase activity in nuclear extracts and recombinant proteins was measured using a DNA methyl-transferase assay, and alterations in DNA methylation status were examined using methylation-specific PCR (MS-PCR) and pyrosequencing. We observe a reactivation of several epigenetically silenced genes including GSTP1, IGFBP3 and RASSF1A. Gemcitabine functionally inhibited DNA methyltransferase activity in both nuclear extracts and recombinant proteins. Gemcitabine dramatically destabilised DNMT1 protein. However, DNA CpG methylation was for the most part unaffected by gemcitabine. In conclusion, gemcitabine both inhibits and destabilises DNA methyltransferases and reactivates epigenetically silenced genes having activity equivalent to decitabine at concentrations significantly lower than those achieved in the treatment of patients with solid tumours. This property may contribute to the anticancer activity of gemcitabine.""","""['Steven G Gray', 'Anne-Marie Baird', ""Fardod O'Kelly"", 'Georgios Nikolaidis', 'Malin Almgren', 'Armelle Meunier', 'Eilis Dockry', 'Donal Hollywood', 'Tomas J Ekström', 'Antoinette S Perry', ""Kenneth J O'Byrne""]""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Int J Mol Med""","""['Activation of silenced tumor suppressor genes in prostate cancer cells by a novel energy restriction-mimetic agent.', 'Genome-wide methylation and expression profiling identifies promoter characteristics affecting demethylation-induced gene up-regulation in melanoma.', 'Epigenetic regulation by decitabine of melanoma differentiation in vitro and in vivo.', ""Antineoplastic activity of the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine in anaplastic large cell lymphoma."", ""Epigenetic DNA-(cytosine-5-carbon) modifications: 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine and DNA-demethylation."", 'Targeting human leukocyte antigen G with chimeric antigen receptors of natural killer cells convert immunosuppression to ablate solid tumors.', 'The role of caveolin-1 in the biofate and efficacy of anti-tumor drugs and their nano-drug delivery systems.', 'Emerging avenues in immunotherapy for the management of malignant pleural mesothelioma.', 'Emerging antiviral therapeutics for human adenovirus infection: Recent developments and novel strategies.', 'Phase I Trial of DNA Methyltransferase Inhibitor Guadecitabine Combined with Cisplatin and Gemcitabine for Solid Malignancies Including Urothelial Carcinoma (SPIRE).']"""

Method:   A single-centre, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study was performed on patients with haemorrhagic chronic radiation proctitis after irradiation for prostate, uterine, cervical, rectal or vaginal cancer. All patients received APC, and were then randomized to oral sucralfate (6 g twice a day) or placebo treatment for 4 weeks. APC was repeated every 8 weeks if necessary after the first session. Patients were graded clinically and endoscopically according to the Chutkan and Gilinski scales before and at 8 and 16 weeks after initial APC treatment (1.5-2 l/min, 25-40 W) and after 52 weeks (clinical only).  Results:   Of 122 patients, 117 completed the entire protocol, with 57/60 in the sucralfate group and 60/62 in the placebo group. At baseline there were no significant differences between the sucralfate and placebo groups. At 1 year, a significant improvement in the clinical scale in both groups occurred compared with baseline. After 16 weeks, the median overall clinical severity scores fell from 4 to 2 points and the median bleeding score from 2 to 0 in both groups.

Methods:   Immunohistochemical staining for GOLPH3 was performed on tissue microarrays of 342 prostate patients. The correlation between GOLPH3 expression with its clinicopathologic factors was also analyzed in order to determine its prognostic significance.  Results:   GOLPH3 expression of normal prostate tissues, benign prostate hyperplasia, high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, and hormone-dependent prostate cancer (HDPC) did not show any statistically significant difference. In contrast, statistically significant difference was reported in moderate/intense GOLPH3 expression in cases diagnosed with HDPC and castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) (P < 0.0005). Moderate /intense expression of GOLPH3 was associated with androgen independence (P = 0.012), higher Gleason score (P = 0.017), bone metastasis (P = 0.024), higher baseline prostate-specific antigen (PSA) (P = 0.038), and higher PSA nadir (P = 0.032). A significantly negative correlation was found between moderate/intense GOLPH3 expression and disease-free survival (DFS) (HR = 0.28, P = 0.012) and overall survival (OS) (HR = 0.42, P = 0.027). Univariated analysis indicated that moderate/intense GOLPH3 expression created a significantly prognostic impact in patients with CRPC. On the other hand, multivariate analysis indicated that GOLPH3 was a significantly independent prognostic factor of DFS (P = 0.027) in all prostate cancer patients.  Conclusions:   In this study, it was discovered that the overexpression of GOLPH3 is associated with the transition of prostate cancer from hormone sensitive phase to hormone refractory phase. GOLPH3 might be an important prognostic factor of DFS and OS in patients with prostate cancer. In totality, GOLPH3 could be used as a novel candidate in devising a more effective therapeutic strategy to tackle CRPC.

Methods:   From January 2007 to December 2009, 132 patients underwent endoscopic resection for primary non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. They were randomly assigned to two groups: 67 patients underwent a transurethral resection of the bladder with bipolar plasmakinetic energy transurethral resection of the bladder and 65 were treated with conventional monopolar transurethral resection.  Results:   The mean operative time was 27 min for bipolar plasmakinetic energy transurethral resection of the bladder and 31 min for monopolar transurethral resection of the bladder. No significant differences in the mean change of hemoglobin and serum sodium level were observed. Mean catheterization time was 1.3 days and 2.3 days for bipolar plasmakinetic energy transurethral resection of the bladder and monopolar transurethral resection of the bladder, respectively.

However, whether AEG-1 deregulation also occurs in neuroblastoma remains unclear. In previous study we reported that AEG-1 was over expressed in neuroblastoma cell lines and knockdown of AEG-1 inhibits proliferation and enhancing chemo-sensitivity to cisplatin or doxorubicin in neuroblastoma cells. In this study, we investigated the expression of AEG-1 and evaluate its prognostic significance by correlating AEG-1 expression levels with clinic pathologic features and survival in 32 archived neuroblastoma patients We found that positive AEG-1 immunoreactivities were present in all neuroblastoma cases, 75% showed high expression of AEG-1. And high expression of AEG-1 was commonly seen in vascular endothelial cells and glandula in neuroblastoma samples. AEG-1 expression was strongly correlated with age at diagnosis (P=0.012), clinical stage (P=0.030) and tumor histology stage (P=0.041). However, our analyses did not show significant associations between AEG-1 expression and other clinical features including gender and primary tumor site. Importantly, our data presented in this report provide, for the first time, evidence that elevated expression of AEG-1 protein is correlated with poor prognosis and reduced survival of patients with neuroblastoma (P= 0.031).

The centrosome normally duplicates precisely once before mitosis in a process that is extensively regulated by protein degradation including SKP1-Cullin 1 (CUL1)-F-box (SCF) E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. The core SCF component CUL1 has recently been found to be required to suppress the formation of supernumerary centrosomes and centrioles, the core-forming units of centrosomes. Here, we identify the CUL1-interacting protein cullin-associated and neddylation-dissociated 1 (CAND1) as a novel centrosomal protein with a role in centriole duplication control. CAND1 was found to synergize with Polo-like kinase 4 (PLK4), a master regulator of centriole biogenesis, in the induction of centriole overduplication. We provide evidence that CAND1 functions in this process by increasing PLK4 protein stability.

Upon ligand binding, the AR binds to thousands of genomic loci and activates a cell-type specific gene program. Prostate cancer growth and progression depend on androgen-induced AR signaling. Treatment of advanced prostate cancer through medical or surgical castration leads to initial response and durable remission, but resistance inevitably develops. In castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), AR activity remains critical for tumor growth despite androgen deprivation. Although previous studies have focused on ligand-dependent AR signaling, in this study we explore AR function under the androgen-deprived conditions characteristic of CRPC. Our data demonstrate that AR persistently occupies a distinct set of genomic loci after androgen deprivation in CRPC. These androgen-independent AR occupied regions have constitutively open chromatin structures that lack the canonical androgen response element and are independent of FoxA1, a transcription factor involved in ligand-dependent AR targeting. Many AR binding events occur at proximal promoters, which can act as enhancers to augment transcriptional activities of other promoters through DNA looping. We further show that androgen-independent AR binding directs a gene expression program in CRPC, which is necessary for the growth of CRPC after androgen withdrawal.""","""['Keith F Decker', 'Dali Zheng', 'Yuhong He', 'Tamara Bowman', 'John R Edwards', 'Li Jia']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Nucleic Acids Res""","""['Distinct transcriptional programs mediated by the ligand-dependent full-length androgen receptor and its splice variants in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Vav3 enhances androgen receptor splice variant activity and is critical for castration-resistant prostate cancer growth and survival.', 'Testosterone boosts for treatment of castration resistant prostate cancer: an experimental implementation of intermittent androgen deprivation.', 'Androgen receptor-dependent and -independent mechanisms driving prostate cancer progression: Opportunities for therapeutic targeting from multiple angles.', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'TRAF4-mediated nonproteolytic ubiquitination of androgen receptor promotes castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Up-regulation of secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor in human samples might have a potential role of predicting prostate cancer recurrence and progression after surgery and hormonal therapy.', 'Adaptive and non-adaptive gene expression responses in prostate cancer during androgen deprivation.', 'CRISPR screens reveal genetic determinants of PARP inhibitor sensitivity and resistance in prostate cancer.', 'FOXA1 in prostate cancer.']"""

Results:   anaemia was predominantly mild (>10 g/dl) and normocytic. There was an increased risk of death from all causes and from cancer for men with low haemoglobin. Cancers were predominantly of the prostate and genito-urinary organs, and to a lesser extent the gastrointestinal tract. There was no increased risk of all cause or cancer death in women.

CXCR1 is a receptor for interleukin 8 (IL8), a pro-inflammatory chemokine, and CXCR1/2 are crucially involved in the prostate cancer development and progression. Thus, we generated a high-affinity human CXCR1/CXCR2 inhibitor, CXCL8 (3-72) K11R/G31P, named G31P, which is a synthetic derivative of the human cytokine, IL-8. In this study, we investigated the effects of G31P on regulation of prostate cancer cell growth in vitro and in nude mouse xenografts. Cell viability, adhesion, and wound healing assays were used to assess the effects of G31P on growth, adhesion, and migration of PC-3 human prostate cancer cells in vitro, respectively. Nude mouse xenografts and xenograft implantation assays were performed to determine the effect of G31P on PC-3 cells in vivo. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect gene expression, and fluorescence imaging was used to detect tumor volume and microvessel density in tumor xenografts. The data showed that G31P treatment significantly reduced PC-3 cell viability, adhesion and migration capacity in a dose-dependent manner (up to 100 ng/ml). Additionally, G31P treatment of nude mice suppressed the growth of orthotopically transplanted tumor xenografts. G31P also inhibited tumor tissue vascularization, which was associated with the decreased expression of vascular endothelial growth factor and nuclear transcription factor (NF)-κB in orthotopic xenograft tissues.

Our aim was to assess the inter-observer agreement of a novel 10-high-power-fields method for assessment of tumor budding at the invasive front and to confirm the prognostic value of tumor budding in our setting of colorectal cancers. Whole tissue sections of 215 colorectal cancers with full clinico-pathological and follow-up information were stained with cytokeratin AE1/AE3 antibody. Presence of buds was scored across 10-high-power fields at the invasive front by two pathologists and two additional observers were asked to score 50 cases of tumor budding randomly selected from the larger cohort. The measurements were correlated to the patient and tumor characteristics. Inter-observer agreement and correlation between observers' scores were excellent (P<0.0001; intraclass correlation coefficient=0.96). A test subgroup of 65 patients (30%) was used to define a valid cutoff score for high-grade tumor budding and the remaining 70% of the patients were entered into the analysis. High-grade budding was defined as an average of ≥10 buds across 10-high-power fields. High-grade budding was associated with a higher tumor grade (P<0.0001), higher TNM stage (P=0.0003), vascular invasion (P<0.0001), infiltrating tumor border configuration (P<0.0001) and reduced survival (P<0.0001). Multivariate analysis confirmed its independent prognostic effect (P=0.007) when adjusting for TNM stage and adjuvant therapy.

It most often has a multifocal distribution within the gland, and different Gleason grades may be present within different foci. Data from our group and others have shown that the genomic deletion of the phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) tumor suppressor gene and the disruption of the ETS gene family have a central role in prostate cancer and are likely to be associated with Gleason grade. In this study, prostate cancer samples were systematically analyzed to determine whether there was concordance between PTEN losses and TMPRSS2-ERG fusion rearrangements, within or between foci in multifocal disease, using well-annotated tissue microarrays (TMAs) consisting of 724 cores derived from 142 radical prostatectomy specimens. Three-color fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis of both the PTEN deletion and the TMPRSS2-ERG fusion was used to precisely map genetic heterogeneity, both within and between tumor foci represented on the TMA. PTEN deletion was observed in 56 of 134 (42%) patients (hemizygous=42 and homozygous=14). TMPRSS2-ERG fusion was observed in 63 of 139 (45%) patients. When analyzed by Gleason pattern for a given TMA core, PTEN deletions were significantly associated with Gleason grades 4 or 5 over grade 3 (P<0.001). Although TMPRSS2-ERG fusions showed a strong relationship with PTEN deletions (P=0.007), TMPRSS2-ERG fusions did not show correlation with Gleason grade. The pattern of genetic heterogeneity of PTEN deletion was more diverse than that observed for TMPRSS2-ERG fusions in multifocal disease. However, the marked interfocal discordance for both TMPRSS2-ERG fusions and PTEN deletions was consistent with the concept that multiple foci of prostate cancer arise independently within the same prostate, and that individual tumor foci can have distinct patterns of genetic rearrangements.""","""['Maisa Yoshimoto', 'Keyue Ding', 'Joan M Sweet', 'Olga Ludkovski', 'Greg Trottier', 'Kyu S Song', 'Anthony M Joshua', 'Neil E Fleshner', 'Jeremy A Squire', 'Andrew J Evans']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Mod Pathol""","""['Association Between ERG/PTEN Genes and Pathologic Parameters of Prostate Cancer With an Emphasis on Gleason Score: A Literature Review.', 'Absence of TMPRSS2:ERG fusions and PTEN losses in prostate cancer is associated with a favorable outcome.', 'Integrated analysis of the genomic instability of PTEN in clinically insignificant and significant prostate cancer.', 'Heterogeneity and chronology of PTEN deletion and ERG fusion in prostate cancer.', 'The prognostic and predictive value of TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion and ERG protein expression in prostate cancer biopsies.', 'Correlations of PTEN and ERG Immunoexpression in Prostate Carcinoma and Lesions Related to Its Natural History: Clinical Perspectives.', 'Association Between ERG/PTEN Genes and Pathologic Parameters of Prostate Cancer With an Emphasis on Gleason Score: A Literature Review.', 'Collision tumors revealed by prospectively assessing subtype-defining molecular alterations in 904 individual prostate cancer foci.', 'Decoding the heterogeneous landscape in the development prostate cancer.', 'FAM46C inhibits cell proliferation and cell cycle progression and promotes apoptosis through PTEN/AKT signaling pathway and is associated with chemosensitivity in prostate cancer.']"""

We assessed the value of endorectal magnetic resonance imaging in predicting upgrading on confirmatory biopsy in men with low risk prostate cancer.  Materials and methods:   A total of 388 consecutive men (mean age 60.6 years, range 33 to 89) with clinically low risk prostate cancer (initial biopsy Gleason score 6 or less, prostate specific antigen less than 10 ng/ml, clinical stage T2a or less) underwent endorectal magnetic resonance imaging before confirmatory biopsy. Three radiologists independently and retrospectively scored tumor visibility on endorectal magnetic resonance imaging using a 5-point scale (1-definitely no tumor to 5-definitely tumor). Inter-reader agreement was assessed with weighted kappa statistics. Associations between magnetic resonance imaging scores and confirmatory biopsy findings were evaluated using measures of diagnostic performance and multivariate logistic regression.  Results:   On confirmatory biopsy, Gleason score was upgraded in 79 of 388 (20%) patients. Magnetic resonance imaging scores of 2 or less had a high negative predictive value (0.96-1.0) and specificity (0.95-1.0) for upgrading on confirmatory biopsy. A magnetic resonance imaging score of 5 was highly sensitive for upgrading on confirmatory biopsy (0.87-0.98). At multivariate analysis patients with higher magnetic resonance imaging scores were more likely to have disease upgraded on confirmatory biopsy (odds ratio 2.16-3.97).

We identified predictors and trends in the use of procedures for post-prostatectomy incontinence.  Materials and methods:   Using SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results) cancer registry data linked with Medicare claims, we identified men 66 years old or older who were treated with radical prostatectomy in 2000 to 2007. The primary outcome was performance of an incontinence procedure. Demographic and clinical predictors of incontinence surgery were evaluated by multivariable regression analysis.  Results:   Of 16,348 men treated with radical prostatectomy 1,057 (6%) had undergone at least 1 incontinence procedure by a median of 20 months after the procedure, including 61% who underwent the first incontinence procedure within 2 years of prostatectomy. Older age and residence in the South were associated with greater probability of an incontinence procedure. Black men and those living in nonmetropolitan areas were less likely than their peers to undergo an incontinence procedure. Of men treated with any incontinence procedure 15% underwent more than 1 type. Of those treated with bulking agents 39% also received a urethral sling or artificial urinary sphincter and 13% who received a sling also had an artificial urinary sphincter. In 34% of the men who underwent any incontinence surgery artificial urinary sphincter placement was the only procedure performed.  Conclusions:   In this population based cohort of older men with prostate cancer only 6% underwent an incontinence procedure after prostatectomy.

In this prospective study we evaluated the natural history of erectile function after prostate brachytherapy without supplemental therapy (external beam radiotherapy, phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors or androgen deprivation therapy) using the International Index of Erectile Function-15.  Materials and methods:   We identified 119 patients who were followed at least 12 months after prostate brachytherapy between 2004 and 2010.

Results:   Mean total International Index of Erectile Function-15 score, and scores on the erectile function, orgasmic function, sexual desire and intercourse satisfaction domains 3 months after brachytherapy were significantly lower than at baseline (p <0.05). They remained lower until 36 months after prostate brachytherapy. Erectile function was maintained 12 months after brachytherapy in 16 of the 48 men (33.3%) with a baseline erectile function domain score of 11 or greater. There was no significant difference in clinical features except the age of patients who maintained the erectile function domain score and their counterparts 12 months after brachytherapy. Multivariate analysis revealed that age 70 years or greater was the only predictive factor for deteriorating erectile function after brachytherapy (p = 0.035).

Men diagnosed with prostate cancer are increasingly involved in making their own treatment decisions and the current recommendations for treatment are based on informed choice. The absence of scientific evidence regarding optimum treatment choices underlines the importance of understanding which factors influence the selection of treatment by men diagnosed with prostate cancer. Previous studies have found that men diagnosed with prostate cancer were more likely to choose radiation therapy over radical prostatectomy if they were older and had a higher PSA level. This is the first large-scale prospective study conducted outside the USA to quantify the factors associated with treatment decisions for men diagnosed with prostate cancer. It found that men who chose surgery were younger, above average physical health, and had lower grade cancers on the Gleason scale; men who had radiation therapy were older and had reduced physical health, with ADT added when men had more advanced disease. About two-thirds of the men said they primarily made the decision about treatment themselves, with the remaining men either sharing the decision-making process with their doctor or else leaving the decision more or less completely up to their doctor. These results highlight the importance of having quality up-to-date information readily available to guide these decisions.  Objective:   • To examine demographic, clinical and quality-of-life indicators for the treatments received by men diagnosed with prostate cancer in Australia.  Subjects and methods:   • This prospective trial included men diagnosed with prostate cancer (n= 1064, response rate = 82%) between 2005 and 2007 in Queensland, Australia, sampled from urologists and hospital outpatient clinics. • Data were collected through telephone interviews and self-administered questionnaires. • Treatment received was categorized into five groups: radical prostatectomy; radiation therapy with neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy (ADT); radiation therapy alone; ADT alone; and monitoring.  Results:   • Sharp contrasts in the choice between radical prostatectomy (47% of men) vs radiation therapy with ADT (30%) were evident among age at diagnosis, travel time to facilities offering radiation treatment, Gleason score, stage, body mass index and physical health. • Men who underwent surgery were younger and of above average physical health, and had lower grade cancers; men who underwent radiation therapy were older and less fit. ADT, in both neoadjuvant and definitive forms, was administered for high-risk and more advanced disease. • Two-thirds (66%) of men stated that they made the final treatment selection themselves.  Conclusions:   • These results suggest that men's baseline health and tumour characteristics influence treatment choices. • Distance from tertiary treatment centres also influenced the treatment received and access to specialist urologists may play a role. • With most men indicating high levels of decisional control, the importance of having quality up-to-date information readily available to guide their decisions cannot be overstated.""","""['Peter D Baade', 'Danny R Youlden', 'Robert A Gardiner', 'Megan Ferguson', 'Joanne F Aitken', 'John Yaxley', 'Suzanne K Chambers']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Factors associated with treatment received by men diagnosed with prostate cancer in queensland, australia.', 'Management of localised prostate cancer: watchful waiting, surgery or radiation therapy, depending on the natural course, which is often relatively slow.', 'Androgen-deprivation therapy as primary treatment for localized prostate cancer: data from Cancer of the Prostate Strategic Urologic Research Endeavor (CaPSURE).', 'Long-term follow-up of a prospective trial of trimodality therapy of weekly paclitaxel, radiation, and androgen deprivation in high-risk prostate cancer with or without prior prostatectomy.', 'Impact of positive surgical margins on prostate-specific antigen failure after radical prostatectomy in adjuvant treatment-naïve patients.', 'Global update on defining and treating high-risk localized prostate cancer with leuprorelin: a USA perspective--identifying men at diagnosis who are at high risk of prostate cancer death after surgery or radiation therapy.', 'Geographical Variations in Prostate Cancer Outcomes: A Systematic Review of International Evidence.', 'Risk factors involved in treatment delays and differences in treatment type for patients with prostate cancer by risk category in an academic safety net hospital.', 'Trajectories of quality of life, life satisfaction, and psychological adjustment after prostate cancer.', 'Prostate cancer: Interpreting cost-utility analysis of prostate cancer treatment.']"""

High-risk and locally advanced prostate cancers are difficult to cure with the standard regimen of radiation therapy (RT) with concurrent androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT). Multiple studies have explored the addition of docetaxel chemotherapy in attempt to improve patient outcomes. Prior Phase I studies have shown that docetaxel 20 mg/m(2) is a safe dose, when given concurrently with 70 Gy of radiation. But current standard RT for prostate cancer uses higher doses, and it is unclear if concurrent chemotherapy is safe with modern RT. This is a Phase I study that explored the addition of concurrent docetaxel chemotherapy to modern RT (intensity-modulated RT to 78 Gy) plus ADT. The study showed that weekly docetaxel at 20 mg/m(2) is safe with modern RT. At a median follow-up of 2.2 years, biochemical progression-free survival was 94%. This triple-therapy regimen is safe and promising for further evaluation in prospective trials.  Objective:   • To evaluate in a phase I trial, the feasibility of adding concurrent weekly docetaxel chemotherapy to high-dose intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) for treatment of high-risk prostate cancer.  Patients and methods:   • Patients with high-risk prostate cancer were treated with a luteinising hormone-releasing hormone agonist (starting 2-3 months before IMRT and lasting 2 years), IMRT of 78 Gy to the prostate and seminal vesicles, and weekly docetaxel during RT. • All patients had computed tomography and bone scans to exclude metastatic disease. • A standard 3 + 3 design was used for docetaxel dose escalation. Successive patients were treated on dose levels of 10, 15, and 20 mg/m(2) of weekly docetaxel.  Results:   • In all, 18 patients participated in the study: 15 (83%) had Gleason 8-10 disease; the other three had either clinical T3 disease and/or a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level of >20 ng/mL. • Grade 3 diarrhoea (a defined dose-limiting toxicity, DLT) occurred in one patient in each of the first two dose levels. However, when the cohorts were expanded, no further DLT was seen. • Weekly docetaxel at 20 mg/m(2) (dose level 3) was successfully given without DLT. • No patient had grade 4 or 5 toxicity. • At a median follow-up of 2.2 years, all patients achieved a PSA nadir of <1 ng/mL, including 13 patients who had an undetectable PSA level. The 2-year biochemical progression-free survival was 94%.

However, a replication-incompetent hemagglutinating virus of Japan (HVJ; Sendai virus) envelope (HVJ-E) suppresses the growth of human cancer cells as effectively as replication-competent live HVJ without producing toxic effects in nonmalignant cells. Here, we analyze the molecular mechanism of the oncolytic activity of HVJ-E.  Experimental design:   The molecules responsible for HVJ-E-induced cancer cell death were elucidated in prostate cancer cell lines, and the effect of HVJ-E on orthotopic prostate cancers was evaluated in nonobese diabetic-severe combined immunodeficient (NOD-SCID) mice.  Results:   The liposome-mediated transfer of viral RNA genome fragments from HVJ-E suppressed the viability of prostate cancer cells but not the viability of the noncancerous prostate epithelium. Knockdown experiments using siRNAs showed that the cancer cell-selective killing induced by HVJ-E was mediated by retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS). Downstream of the RIG-I/MAVS pathway, both TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) and Noxa were upregulated by HVJ-E in the castration-resistant prostate cancer cell line PC3 but not in the noncancerous prostate epithelial cell line PNT2. TRAIL siRNA but not Noxa siRNA significantly inhibited HVJ-E-induced cell death in PC3 cells.

Phenotyping and genotyping of CTC may permit ""real-time"" treatment decisions, provided CTCs are available for examination. Here, we investigate what is needed to detect CTC in all patients.  Experimental design:   CTCs enumerated in 7.5 mL of blood together with survival from 836 patients with metastatic breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer were used to predict the CTC concentration in the 42% of these patients in whom no CTCs were found and to establish the relation of concentration of CTCs with survival. Influence of different CTC definitions were investigated by automated cell recognition and a flow cytometric assay without an enrichment or permeabilization step.  Results:   A log-logistic regression of the log of CTC yielded a good fit to the CTC frequency distribution. Extrapolation of the blood volume to 5 L predicted that 99% of patients had at least one CTC before therapy initiation. Survival of patients with EpCAM+, cytokeratin+, CD45- nucleated CTCs is reduced by 6.6 months for each 10-fold CTC increase. Using flow cytometry, the potential three-fold recovery improvement is not sufficient to detect CTC in all patients in 7.5 mL of blood.  Conclusions:   EpCAM+, cytokeratin+, CD45- nucleated CTCs are present in all patients with metastatic breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer and their frequency is proportional to survival. To serve as a liquid biopsy for the majority of patients, a substantial improvement of CTC yield is needed, which can only be achieved by a dramatic increase in sample volume.""","""['Frank A W Coumans', 'Sjoerd T Ligthart', 'Jonathan W Uhr', 'Leon W M M Terstappen']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Clin Cancer Res""","""['Cytometric characterization of circulating tumor cells captured by microfiltration and their correlation to the CellSearch(®) CTC test.', 'Detection of EpCAM positive and negative circulating tumor cells in metastatic breast cancer patients.', 'EpCAM-Independent Enrichment of Circulating Tumor Cells in Metastatic Breast Cancer.', ""Circulating tumor cell enumeration by the CellSearch system: the clinician's guide to breast cancer treatment?"", 'Technologies for detection of circulating tumor cells: facts and vision.', 'Significance of circulating tumor cells in lung cancer: a narrative review.', 'Circulating cancer stem cells: an interesting niche to explore.', 'Applications of Circulating Tumor Cells and Circulating Tumor DNA in Precision Oncology for Breast Cancers.', 'A Laboratory-Friendly CTC Identification: Comparable Double-Immunocytochemistry with Triple-Immunofluorescence.', 'Efficient capture of circulating tumor cells with low molecular weight folate receptor-specific ligands.']"""

This study aimed to describe the experiences of men living with prostate cancer shared within conversational support groups during a course of radiotherapy.  Method:   Nine men participated in one of two groups that met six or seven times, led by a professional nurse. Qualitative content analysis was used to identify themes and subthemes in the recorded group conversations.  Results:   The analysis resulted in six themes: living with a changing body, being in the hands of others, learning to live with the disease, the importance of knowledge, everyday life support, and meeting in the support group. The men discussed a wide variety of bodily experiences and described support from healthcare professionals, relatives, friends, and the support group as crucial to their recovery.  Significance of results:   Meeting men in a similar situation, sharing experiences of living with the disease, and feeling allied to each other were important to the men in our study.

The availability of dedicated PET/CT scanners allows fusioning of morphological and functional images, which enables accurate localization of sites of pathological tracer uptake and ease the differentiation between malignant and benign findings. A noteworthy advantage of this whole-body technique is that it provides information on multiple anatomic sites at a single time. As such, the technique has the capability of distinguishing between local relapse and distant metastases, and therefore has the potential to guide the medical treatment. The positive detection rate of [11C]choline PET/CT varies substantially in relation to the inclusion criteria. Studies which included unselected consecutive patients reported a positive detection rate ranging between 40% and 70%. Serum PSA level represents the single, most important factor affecting the rate of positive scans. Other positive predicitive factors include fast PSA kinetics (PSA velocity, PSA doubling time), advanced pathological state at initial staging, previous biochemical failure, hormone resistance and older age. Recent studies indicate that [11C]choline PET/CT has the potential to early restaging PCa patients for PSA levels lower than 1-1.5 ng/mL. However, more studies are necessary to better define the potential of this technique for low PSA levels. The previously cited risk factors can be used to identify patients that are at greater risk and that might best benefit from PET/CT scans. Patients that develop biochemical failure during androgen deprivation therapy (hormone resistance) have a higher likelihood for a positive [11C]choline PET/CT scan in comparison to patients that are drug naïve (hormone sensitive) and are not required to withdraw the anti-androgenic treatment before PET/CT.""","""['G Giovacchini', 'A J Breeuwsma']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Q J Nucl Med Mol Imaging""","""['Influence of trigger PSA and PSA kinetics on 11C-Choline PET/CT detection rate in patients with biochemical relapse after radical prostatectomy.', 'PET/CT and choline: diagnosis and staging.', 'Early biochemical relapse after radical prostatectomy: which prostate cancer patients may benefit from a restaging 11C-Choline PET/CT scan before salvage radiation therapy?', 'Prostate-specific antigen kinetics and choline PET/CT in patients with biochemical relapse after primary treatment for prostate cancer.', 'The role of 11C-choline and 18F-fluorocholine positron emission tomography (PET) and PET/CT in prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'How we read FCH-PET/CT for prostate cancer.']"""

PET and PET/CT using [11C]- and [18F]-labelled choline derivates are increasingly being used for imaging primary and recurrent prostate cancer. The value of [11C]- and [18F]choline PET and PET/CT in patients with biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer has been evaluated in many studies and shows an increasing importance. Morphological imaging techniques such as TRUS, CT and MRI (including functional imaging tools) have shown only limited accuracy for the diagnosis of primary prostate cancer. Molecular imaging techniques such as PET and PET/CT may improve the detection rate and localization of primary prostate cancer. The potential of PET/CT using [11C]- and [18F]-labelled choline derivates for the diagnosis of primary prostate cancer has been assessed in a lot of studies with partly controversial results. [11C]- and [18F]choline PET and PET/CT demonstrated moderate sensitivity for the detection of primary prostate cancer, which depends on the tumour configuration. Furthermore the detection rate is limited by a considerable number of microcarcinomas that can often not be visualized due to partial volume effects. Therefore small and in part rind-like tumours can often not be detected. Additionally, specificity of [11C]- and [18F]choline PET and PET/CT is limited as differentiation between benign prostatic changes like prostatitis, prostatic hyperplasia and high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN) is not always possible. At the present time, the routine use of PET/CT with [11C]- and [18F]-labelled choline derivates can not be recommended as a first-line screening procedure for primary prostate cancer in men at risk. However, choline PET and PET/CT may be useful in preparation of a focused re-biopsy in patients suffering from clinically suspected prostate cancer with repeatedly negative prostate biopsies. In the future [11C]- and [18F]choline PET and PET/CT may also be helpful in patient stratification with respect to primary surgery and radiation therapy.""","""['M Farsad', 'S Schwarzenböck', 'B J Krause']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Q J Nucl Med Mol Imaging""","""['Restaging prostate cancer patients with biochemical failure with PET/CT and radiolabeled choline.', 'Choline PET and PET/CT in Primary Diagnosis and Staging of Prostate Cancer.', 'Imaging of prostate cancer with PET/CT and radioactively labeled choline derivates.', 'Detection and localization of prostate cancer: correlation of (11)C-choline PET/CT with histopathologic step-section analysis.', 'Clinical evidence on PET/CT for radiation therapy planning in prostate cancer.', 'Positron emission tomography with computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging for primary staging of prostate cancer.', 'Molecular imaging of prostate cancer.', 'Role of choline PET/CT in guiding target volume delineation for irradiation of prostate cancer.', 'Challenges in accurate registration of 3-D medical imaging and histopathology in primary prostate cancer.']"""

Is this more effective than delayed rehabilitation?""","""Background:   There has been substantial increase in use of androgen deprivation therapy as adjuvant management of prostate cancer. However, this leads to a range of musculoskeletal toxicities including reduced bone mass and increased skeletal fractures compounded with rapid metabolic alterations, including increased body fat, reduced lean mass, insulin resistance and negative lipoprotein profile, increased incidence of cardiovascular and metabolic morbidity, greater distress and reduced quality of life. Numerous research studies have demonstrated certain exercise prescriptions to be effective at preventing or even reversing these treatment toxicities. However, all interventions to date have been of rehabilitative intent being implemented after a minimum of 3 months since initiation of androgen deprivation, by which time considerable physical and psychological health problems have manifested. The pressing question is whether it is more efficacious to commence exercise therapy at the same time as initiating androgen deprivation, so treatment induced adverse effects can be immediately attenuated or indeed prevented.  Methods/design:   We are proposing a multi-site randomized controlled trial with partial crossover to examine the effects of timing of exercise implementation (immediate or delayed) on preserving long-term skeletal health, reversing short- and long-term metabolic and cardiovascular risk factors, and supporting mental health in men receiving androgen deprivation therapy. 124 men who are about to initiate androgen deprivation for prostate cancer will be randomized to immediate or delayed groups. Immediate will commence a 6-month exercise program within 7-10 days of their first dose. Delayed will receive usual care for 6 months and then commence the exercise program for 6 months (partial cross-over). Immediate will be free to adopt the lifestyle of their choosing following the initial 6-month intervention. Measurements for primary and secondary endpoints will take place at baseline, 6 months and 12 months.  Discussion:   This project is unique as it explores a fundamental question of when exercise implementation will be of most benefit and addresses both physical and psychological consequences of androgen deprivation initiation. The final outcome may be adjunct treatment which will reduce if not prevent the toxicities of androgen deprivation, ultimately resulting in reduced morbidity and mortality for men with prostate cancer.

Those that are available tend to be led by highly trained professionals, limiting their accessibility and long-term sustainability. In addition, it is recognised that patients who might benefit from conventional face-to-face psychosocial interventions do not access these, either by preference or because of geographical or mobility barriers. Self-directed interventions can overcome some of these limitations and have been shown to contribute to patient well-being. This study will examine the feasibility of a self-directed, coping skills intervention for couples affected by cancer, called Coping-Together, and begin to explore its potential impact on couples' illness adjustment. The pilot version of Coping-Together includes a series of four booklets, a DVD, and a relaxation audio CD.  Methods/design:   In this double-blind, two-group, parallel, randomized controlled trial, 70 couples will be recruited within 4 months of a prostate cancer diagnosis through urology private practices and randomized to: 1) Coping-Together or 2) a minimal ethical care condition. Minimal ethical care condition couples will be mailed information booklets available at the Cancer Council New South Wales and a brochure for the Cancer Council Helpline. The primary outcome (anxiety) and additional secondary outcomes (distress, depression, dyadic adjustment, quality of life, illness or caregiving appraisal, self-efficacy, and dyadic and individual coping) will be assessed at baseline (before receiving study material) and 2 months post-baseline. Intention-to-treat and per protocol analysis will be conducted.  Discussion:   As partners' distress rates exceed not only population norms, but also those reported by patients themselves, it is imperative that coping skills interventions target the couple as a unit and enhance both partners' ability to overcome cancer challenges. This pilot study will examine the feasibility and potential efficacy of Coping-Together in optimising couples' illness adjustment. This is one of the first feasibility studies to test this innovative coping intervention, which in turn will contribute to the larger literature advocating for psychosocial care of couples affected by prostate cancer.
