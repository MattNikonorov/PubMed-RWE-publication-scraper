So far, most of the genomic studies have been conducted in a single domain, e.g., by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) or microarray gene expression investigation. A combined analysis of disease susceptibility genes across multiple platforms at the pathway level is an urgent need because it can reveal more reliable and more biologically important information.  Results:   We performed an integrative pathway analysis of a GWAS dataset and a microarray gene expression dataset in prostate cancer. We obtained a comprehensive pathway annotation set from knowledge-based public resources, including KEGG pathways and the prostate cancer candidate gene set, and gene sets specifically defined based on cross-platform information. By leveraging on this pathway collection, we first searched for significant pathways in the GWAS dataset using four methods, which represent two broad groups of pathway analysis approaches. The significant pathways identified by each method varied greatly, but the results were more consistent within each method group than between groups. Next, we conducted a gene set enrichment analysis of the microarray gene expression data and found 13 pathways with cross-platform evidence, including ""Fc gamma R-mediated phagocytosis"" (P GWAS = 0.003, P expr < 0.001, and P combined = 6.18 × 10(-8)), ""regulation of actin cytoskeleton"" (P GWAS = 0.003, P expr = 0.009, and P combined = 3.34 × 10(-4)), and ""Jak-STAT signaling pathway"" (P GWAS = 0.001, P expr = 0.084, and P combined = 8.79 × 10(-4)).  Conclusions:   Our results provide evidence at both the genetic variation and expression levels that several key pathways might have been involved in the pathological development of prostate cancer. Our framework that employs gene expression data to facilitate pathway analysis of GWAS data is not only feasible but also much needed in studying complex disease.""","""['Peilin Jia', 'Yang Liu', 'Zhongming Zhao']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""BMC Syst Biol""","""['Gene, pathway and network frameworks to identify epistatic interactions of single nucleotide polymorphisms derived from GWAS data.', 'Detecting discordance enrichment among a series of two-sample genome-wide expression data sets.', 'Association between Prostinogen (KLK15) genetic variants and prostate cancer risk and aggressiveness in Australia and a meta-analysis of GWAS data.', 'Post-GWAS in prostate cancer: from genetic association to biological contribution.', 'The Molecular Revolution in Cutaneous Biology: The Era of Genome-Wide Association Studies and Statistical, Big\xa0Data, and Computational Topics.', 'Comprehensive analysis of the lncRNA‑associated competing endogenous RNA network in breast cancer.', 'Integrating proteomic and phosphoproteomic data for pathway analysis in breast cancer.', 'Genomics of human pulmonary tuberculosis: from genes to pathways.', 'A Review of Pathway-Based Analysis Tools That Visualize Genetic Variants.', 'AIM1 is an actin-binding protein that suppresses cell migration and micrometastatic dissemination.']"""

However, few investigations have been able to study this relationship prospectively and in well-controlled settings. Moreover, no studies have determined whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that influence ALA metabolism are associated with this common cancer. The purpose of this study was to explore associations between prostatic levels of ALA, SNPs and prostate cancer-specific biomarkers in samples collected from a previous randomized clinical trial conducted using a presurgical model and which tested the effects of flaxseed supplementation, a rich source of ALA, prior to prostatectomy (n = 134). Serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was determined and immunohistochemistry was used to assess tumor proliferation rate (Ki67). Prostatic ALA was determined with gas chromatography. Seven previously identified SNPs associated with delta-6 desaturase activity (rs99780, rs174537, rs174545, rs174572, rs498793, rs3834458 and rs968567) were tested for associations with prostatic ALA, PSA and Ki67. Despite consuming seven times more ALA per day, men in the flaxseed arm had similar amounts of prostatic ALA relative to men not consuming flaxseed. In unadjusted analysis, there were significant positive associations between prostatic ALA and PSA (ρ = 0.191, p = 0.028) and Ki67 (ρ = 0.186, p = 0.037). After adjusting for covariates (flaxseed, age, race, BMI and statin-use) the association between ALA and PSA remained (p = 0.004) but was slightly attenuated for Ki67 (p = 0.051). We did not observe associations between any of the SNPs studied and prostatic ALA; however, in models for PSA there was a significant interaction between rs498793 and ALA and for Ki67 there were significant interactions with ALA and rs99780 and rs174545. Independent and inverse associations were observed between rs174572 and Ki67. This study provides evidence that prostatic ALA, independent of the amount of ALA consumed, is positively associated with biomarkers of aggressive prostate cancer and that genetic variation may modify this relationship.""","""['Maria Azrad', 'Kui Zhang', 'Robin T Vollmer', 'John Madden', 'Thomas J Polascik', 'Denise C Snyder', 'Mack T Ruffin', 'Judd W Moul', 'Dean Brenner', 'Robert W Hardy', 'Wendy Demark-Wahnefried']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Effect of alpha linolenic acid supplementation on serum prostate specific antigen (PSA): results from the alpha omega trial.', 'Prostate tissue and leukocyte levels of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in men with benign prostate hyperplasia or prostate cancer.', 'Tumour growth fraction measured by immunohistochemical staining of Ki67 is an independent prognostic factor in preoperative prostate biopsies with small-volume or low-grade prostate cancer.', 'Genetic variation in FADS genes is associated with maternal long-chain PUFA status but not with cognitive development of infants in a high fish-eating observational study.', 'Implications of dietary α-linolenic acid in bone health.', 'Alpha-lipoic acid\xa0induced apoptosis of PC3 prostate cancer cells through an alteration on mitochondrial membrane depolarization and MMP-9 mRNA expression.', 'Metabolomic profiles of metformin in breast cancer survivors: a pooled analysis of plasmas from two randomized placebo-controlled trials.', 'Plasma omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and recurrence of endometrial cancer.', 'High expression of APC is an unfavorable prognostic biomarker in T4 gastric cancer patients.', 'Metabolic Profiling in Formalin-Fixed and Paraffin-Embedded Prostate Cancer Tissues.']"""

Its deregulation is involved in the pathogenesis of diverse cancer and immune diseases. Recent experimental evidence reveals that dynamic histone methylation/demethylation mediated by histone methyltransferases and demethylases plays a critical role in regulation of chromatin remodelling and gene expression. In the present study, we compared the histone 3 lysine 4 (H3-K4) methylation status of the 15-LOX-1 promoter region of the two Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) cell lines L1236 and L428 with abundant and undetectable 15-LOX-1 expression, respectively. We identified a potential role of H3-K4 methylation in positive regulation of 15-LOX-1 transcription. Furthermore, we found that histone methyltransferase SMYD3 inhibition reduced 15-LOX-1 expression by decreasing promoter activity in L1236 cells. SMYD3 knock down in these cells abolished di-/trimethylation of H3-K4, attenuated the occupancy by the transactivator STAT6, and led to diminished histone H3 acetylation at the 15-LOX-1 promoter. In contrast, inhibition of SMCX, a JmjC-domain-containing H3-K4 tri-demethylase, upregulated 15-LOX-1 expression through induction of H3-K4 trimethylation, histone acetylation and STAT6 recruitment at the 15-LOX-1 promoter in L428 cells. In addition, we observed strong SMYD3 expression in the prostate cancer cell line LNCaP and its inhibition led to decreased 15-LOX-1 expression. Taken together, our data suggest that regulation of histone methylation/demethylation at the 15-LOX-1 promoter is important in 15-LOX-1 expression.""","""['Cheng Liu', 'Dawei Xu', 'Hongya Han', 'Yidong Fan', 'Frida Schain', 'Zhonghua Xu', 'Hans-Erik Claesson', 'Magnus Björkholm', 'Jan Sjöberg']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Epigenetic and transcriptional control of the 15-lipoxygenase-1 gene in a Hodgkin lymphoma cell line.', 'Chromatin modification requirements for 15-lipoxygenase-1 transcriptional reactivation in colon cancer cells.', 'Identification of JmjC domain-containing UTX and JMJD3 as histone H3 lysine 27 demethylases.', 'The roles of histone lysine methylation in epigenetic regulation.', 'Current perspectives on histone demethylases.', 'Epigenetic regulation of macrophage polarization in wound healing.', 'Histone methylation in pre-cancerous liver diseases and hepatocellular carcinoma: recent overview.', 'The SMYD family proteins in immunology: An update of their obvious and non-obvious relations with the immune system.', 'High expression of SMYD3 indicates poor survival outcome and promotes tumour progression through an IGF-1R/AKT/E2F-1 positive feedback loop in bladder cancer.', 'Prognostic significance of stromal SMYD3 expression in colorectal cancer of TNM stage I-III.']"""

We have previously demonstrated that green tea polyphenols (GTP) induce apoptosis in prostate cancer cells irrespective of p53 status. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these observations remain elusive. Here we investigated the mechanisms of GTP-induced apoptosis in human prostate cancer LNCaP cells stably-transfected with short hairpin-RNA against p53 (LNCaPshp53) and control vector (LNCaPshV). GTP treatment induced p53 stabilization and activation of downstream targets p21/waf1 and Bax in a dose-dependent manner specifically in LNCaPshV cells. However, GTP-induced FAS upregulation through activation of c-jun-N-terminal kinase resulted in FADD phosphorylation, caspase-8 activation and truncation of BID, leading to apoptosis in both LNCaPshV and LNCaPshp53 cells. In parallel, treatment of cells with GTP resulted in inhibition of survival pathway, mediated by Akt deactivation and loss of BAD phosphorylation more prominently in LNCaPshp53 cells. These distinct routes of cell death converged to a common pathway, leading to loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential, cytochrome c release and activation of terminal caspases, resulting in PARP-cleavage. GTP-induced apoptosis was attenuated with JNK inhibitor, SP600125 in both cell lines; whereas PI3K-Akt inhibitor, LY294002 resulted in increased cell death prominently in LNCaPshp53 cells, establishing the role of two distinct pathways of GTP-mediated apoptosis. Furthermore, GTP exposure resulted in inhibition of class I HDAC protein, accumulation of acetylated histone-H3 in total cellular chromatin, resulting in increased accessibility of transcription factors to bind with the promoter sequences of p21/waf1 and Bax, regardless of the p53 status of cells, consistent with effects elicited by an HDAC inhibitor, trichostatin A. These results demonstrate that GTP induces prostate cancer cell death by two distinct mechanisms regardless of p53 status, thus identifying specific well-defined molecular mechanisms that may be targeted by chemopreventive and/or therapeutic strategies.""","""['Karishma Gupta', 'Vijay S Thakur', 'Natarajan Bhaskaran', 'Akbar Nawab', 'Melissa A Babcook', 'Mark W Jackson', 'Sanjay Gupta']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Green tea polyphenols causes cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in prostate cancer cells by suppressing class I histone deacetylases.', 'Green tea polyphenols increase p53 transcriptional activity and acetylation by suppressing class I histone deacetylases.', 'Role of p53 and NF-kappaB in epigallocatechin-3-gallate-induced apoptosis of LNCaP cells.', 'Histone deacetylase inhibitors: signalling towards p21cip1/waf1.', 'Modulation of signaling pathways in prostate cancer by green tea polyphenols.', 'Possible Side Effects of Polyphenols and Their Interactions with Medicines.', ""Pharmacological Properties of 4', 5, 7-Trihydroxyflavone (Apigenin) and Its Impact on Cell Signaling Pathways."", 'Valorization of Onion Waste by Obtaining Extracts Rich in Phenolic Compounds and Feasibility of Its Therapeutic Use on Colon Cancer.', 'Comparative Cytotoxic Activity of Hydroxytyrosol and Its Semisynthetic Lipophilic Derivatives in Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'p53 Enhances Artemisia annua L.

At sufficiently high ultrasound transmit amplitudes it has also recently been shown that USMB treatments can, on their own, induce vascular damage, shutdown blood flow, and inhibit tumor growth. The objective of this study is to examine the antitumor effects of 'antivascular' USMB treatments in conjunction with chemotherapy, which differs from previous work which has sought to enhance drug uptake with USMBs by increasing vascular permeability. Conceptually this is a strategy similar to combining vascular disrupting agents with a chemotherapy, and we have selected the taxane docetaxel (Taxotere) for evaluating this approach as it has previously been shown to have potent antitumor effects when combined with small molecule vascular disrupting agents. Experiments were conducted on PC3 tumors implanted in athymic mice. USMB treatments were performed at a frequency of 1 MHz employing sequences of 50 ms bursts (0.00024 duty cycle) at 1.65 MPa. USMB treatments were administered on a weekly basis for 4 weeks with docetaxel (DTX) being given intravenously at a dose level of 5 mg/kg. The USMB treatments, either alone or in combination with DTX, induced an acute reduction in tumor perfusion which was accompanied at the 24 hour point by significantly enhanced necrosis and apoptosis. Longitudinal experiments showed a modest prolongation in survival but no significant growth inhibition occurred in DTX-only and USMB-only treatment groups relative to control tumors. The combined USMB-DTX treatment group produced tumor shrinkage in weeks 4-6, and significant growth inhibition and survival prolongation relative to the control (p<0.001), USMB-only (p<0.01) and DTX-only treatment groups (p<0.01).

The aim of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the relationship between insulin glargine and cancer incidence.  Methods:   All observational studies and randomized controlled trials evaluating the relationship of insulin glargine and cancer risk were identified in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library and the Chinese Biomedical Medical Literature Database, through March 2012. Odds ratios (ORs) with corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated with a random-effects model. Confidence in the estimates of the obtained effects (quality of evidence) was assessed by using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach.  Results:   A total of 11 studies including 448,928 study subjects and 19,128 cancer patients were finally identified for the meta-analysis. Insulin glargine use was associated with a lower odds of cancer compared with non-glargine insulin use (OR 0.81, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.98, P = 0.03; very low-quality evidence). Glargine did not increase the odds of breast cancer (OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.46, P = 0.966; very low-quality evidence). Compared with non-glargine insulin, no significant association was found between insulin glargine and prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer and respiratory tract cancer. Insulin glargine use was associated with lower odds of other site-specific cancer.

Although RhoA and Rac1 signaling pathways are frequently exploited with the aid of effective small molecule modulators, studies of the Cdc42 subclass have lagged because of a lack of such means. We have applied high-throughput in silico screening and identified compounds that are able to fit into the surface groove of Cdc42, which is critical for guanine nucleotide exchange factor binding. Based on the interaction between Cdc42 and intersectin (ITSN), a specific Cdc42 guanine nucleotide exchange factor, we discovered compounds that rendered ITSN-like interactions in the binding pocket. By using in vitro binding and imaging as well as biochemical and cell-based assays, we demonstrated that ZCL278 has emerged as a selective Cdc42 small molecule modulator that directly binds to Cdc42 and inhibits its functions. In Swiss 3T3 fibroblast cultures, ZCL278 abolished microspike formation and disrupted GM130-docked Golgi structures, two of the most prominent Cdc42-mediated subcellular events. ZCL278 reduces the perinuclear accumulation of active Cdc42 in contrast to NSC23766, a selective Rac inhibitor. ZCL278 suppresses Cdc42-mediated neuronal branching and growth cone dynamics as well as actin-based motility and migration in a metastatic prostate cancer cell line (i.e., PC-3) without disrupting cell viability. Thus, ZCL278 is a small molecule that specifically targets Cdc42-ITSN interaction and inhibits Cdc42-mediated cellular processes, thus providing a powerful tool for research of Cdc42 subclass of Rho GTPases in human pathogenesis, such as those of cancer and neurological disorders.""","""['Amy Friesland', 'Yaxue Zhao', 'Yan-Hua Chen', 'Lie Wang', 'Huchen Zhou', 'Qun Lu']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A""","""['A Cdc42 mutant specifically activated by intersectin.', 'Inhibition of Cdc42-intersectin interaction by small molecule ZCL367 impedes cancer cell cycle progression, proliferation, migration, and tumor growth.', 'Targeting Cdc42 with the small molecule drug AZA197 suppresses primary colon cancer growth and prolongs survival in a preclinical mouse xenograft model by downregulation of PAK1 activity.', 'The guanine nucleotide exchange factor Tiam1: a Janus-faced molecule in cellular signaling.', ""The role of Rho GTPases' substrates Rac and Cdc42 in osteoclastogenesis and relevant natural medicinal products study."", 'Molecular dynamics simulations reveal the inhibition mechanism of Cdc42 by RhoGDI1.', 'Targeting small GTPases: emerging grasps on previously untamable targets, pioneered by KRAS.', 'Design, Synthesis, In Vitro and In Vivo Characterization of CDC42 GTPase Interaction Inhibitors for the Treatment of Cancer.', 'Host Cell Targets for Unconventional Antivirals against RNA Viruses.', 'TRIM56 acts through the IQGAP1-CDC42 signaling axis to promote glioma cell migration and invasion.']"""

Chemotherapy response is very poor and resistance to hormone-based treatments is frequent in advances stages. Recently, tumor-initiating cells or cancer stem cells (CSCs) have been identified in several cancers, including PCa. These cells are thought to be responsible for therapy resistance, relapse and metastasis. In the present work, enriched populations of CSCs were obtained using a mixed procedure that included differential clone-forming ability, sphere growing induction (prostatospheres) and magnetic-associated cell sorting (MACS). Also, stem marker expression was determined in PCa biopsies of different histological grades and metastasis samples. The signature for stem markers of the isolated CSCs was CD133+/CD44+/ABCG2+/ CD24-. Expression of stem markers (CD133, CD44, and ABCG2) was higher in medium Gleason biopsies than in lower and higher grades, and lymph-node and bone metastasis samples. These results suggest that the CSCs in PCa reach an important number in medium Gleason grades, when the tumor is still confined into the gland. At this stage, the surgical treatment is usually with curative intention. However, an important percentage of patients relapse after treatment. Number and signature of CSCs may be a prognosis factor for PCa recurrence.""","""['Enrique A Castellón', 'Rodrigo Valenzuela', 'Jorge Lillo', 'Viviana Castillo', 'Héctor R Contreras', 'Iván Gallegos', 'Alejandro Mercado', 'Christian Huidobro']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Biol Res""","""['Knockdown of ZEB1 reverses cancer stem cell properties in prostate cancer cells.', 'MicroRNA expression profile of colon cancer stem-like cells in HT29 adenocarcinoma cell line.', 'External beam radiotherapy (EBRT) suppressed prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA) mRNA expression in clinically localized prostate cancer.', 'Roles of microRNAs during prostatic tumorigenesis and tumor progression.', 'Tumor markers.

Results:   No significant differences were found among age quartiles regarding serum tT levels and tT/E2 ratio. Conversely, E2 and SHBG levels significantly increased throughout time (all, p ≤ 0.001). Total T did not linearly change according to continuously coded patient age; in contrast, E2 and SHBG linearly increased (all, p ≤ 0.001), whereas tT/E2 decreased (p = 0.016) with aging.

The aim of this study was to quantify the benefits of using MRI for treatment planning as compared to CT-based planning for temporary implant prostate brachytherapy.  Material and methods:   CT and MRI image data of 13 patients were used to delineate the prostate and organs at risk (OARs) and to reconstruct the implanted catheters (typically 12). An experienced treatment planner created plans on the CT-based structure sets (CT-plan) and on the MRI-based structure sets (MRI-plan). Then, active dwell-positions and weights of the CT-plans were transferred to the MRI-based structure sets (CT-plan(MRI-contours)) and resulting dosimetric parameters and tumour control probabilities (TCPs) were studied.  Results:   For the CT-plan(MRI-contours) a statistically significant lower target coverage was detected: mean V100 was 95.1% as opposed to 98.3% for the original plans (p < 0.01). Planning on CT caused cold-spots that influence the TCP. MRI-based planning improved the TCPs by 6-10%, depending on the parameters of the radiobiological model used for TCP calculation. Basing the treatment plan on either CT- or MRI-delineations does not influence plan quality.  Conclusion:   Evaluation of CT-based treatment planning by transferring the plan to MRI reveals underdosage of the prostate, especially at the base side.

Studies from different populations, tumor sites, or health care systems have provided inconsistent findings. In the present study, we examined a less well-investigated hypothesis that age plays a crucial role in cancer risk in schizophrenia. We conducted a nationwide cohort study using Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) between 1995 and 2007. Overall, gender-, and age-stratified standardized incidence ratios (SIR) were used to investigate the pattern of cancer risk by age. Of the 102 202 schizophrenic patients, 1738 developed cancer after a diagnosis of schizophrenia (SIR = 0.92; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.90-0.96). However, the age-stratified SIR declined with age (e.g. SIR [95% CI] = 1.97 [1.85-2.33], 0.68 [0.65-0.78], and 0.36 [0.34-0.45] for those aged 20-29, 60-69, and ≥70 years, respectively) in both genders and for major cancers. Cancer risks in schizophrenic patients were lower for cancers that are more likely to develop at an older age in the general population (e.g. stomach cancer [SIR = 0.62; 95% CI 0.57-0.80], pancreatic cancer [SIR = 0.49; 95% CI 0.39-0.84], and prostate cancer [SIR = 0.35; 95% CI 0.29-0.58]). In contrast, cancer risks were higher for cancers that have a younger age of onset, such as cancers of the nasopharynx (SIR = 1.18; 95% CI 1.08-1.49), breast (SIR = 1.50; 95% CI 1.44-1.66) and uterine corpus (SIR = 2.15; 95% CI 1.98-2.74). The unique age structures and early aging potential of schizophrenia populations may contribute to the observed inverse relationship between age and cancer risk.

Vav3, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor, is up-regulated following progression to castration resistance in preclinical models and is overexpressed in a significant number of human prostate cancers. Vav3 is a novel co-activator of the AR. We sought to identify Vav3 binding partners in an effort to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying Vav3 enhancement of AR activity and to identify new therapeutic targets. The cell division cycle 37 homolog (Cdc37), a protein kinase-specific co-chaperone for Hsp90, was identified as a Vav3 interacting protein by yeast two-hybrid screening. Vav3-Cdc37 interaction was confirmed by GST pulldown and, for native proteins, by co-immunoprecipitation experiments in prostate cancer cells. Cdc37 potentiated Vav3 co-activation of AR transcriptional activity and Vav3 enhancement of AR N-terminal-C-terminal interaction, which is essential for optimal receptor transcriptional activity. Cdc37 increased prostate cancer cell proliferation selectively in Vav3-expressing cells. Cdc37 did not affect Vav3 nucleotide exchange activity, Vav3 protein levels, or subcellular localization. Disruption of Vav3-Cdc37 interaction inhibited Vav3 enhancement of AR transcriptional activity and AR N-C interaction. Diminished Vav3-Cdc37 interaction also caused decreased prostate cancer cell proliferation selectively in Vav3-expressing cells.

Methods:   A panel of eleven cell lines originating in normal or malignant prostate and primary prostate epithelial cells were cultured in reconstituted basement membrane (rBM) matrix with or without non-proliferating but metabolically active endothelial cells. Morphogenesis was evaluated by phase contrast microscopy and further characterized by immunocyto/histocemistry and confocal microscopy.  Results:   Endothelial cells induced clonogenic potential of most prostate cell lines and formation of branching and mesenchymal-like colonies. One of the normal-derived cell lines in the panel (PZ-HPV-7) displayed unique properties in rBM culture by forming large and complex branching structures resembling the ductal architecture of the prostate. This ability was highly dependent on epithelial seeding density and soluble factors derived from the endothelial cells. High seeding density suppressed branching of PZ-HPV-7 but survival was compromised at low density in the absence of endothelium.

Here we demonstrate that TNFAIP8 expression is induced by androgen in hormone-responsive LNCaP prostate cancer cells. In athymic mice bearing hormone-refractory PC-3 prostate tumor xenografts, intravenous treatment with a liposomal formulation of TNFAIP8 antisense oligonucleotide (LE-AS5) caused reduced expression of TNFAIP8 in tumor tissues, and a combination of LE-AS5 and radiation or docetaxel treatment resulted in significant inhibition of PC-3 tumor growth as compared to single agents. The immunohistochemical evaluation of TNFAIP8 expression revealed correlation of both cytoplasmic and nuclear TNFAIP8 overexpression with high grade prostatic adenocarcinomas, while nuclear overexpression was found to be an independent predictor of disease recurrence controlling for tumor grade. Increased nuclear TNFAIP8 expression was statistically significantly associated with a 2.44 fold (95 % confidence interval: 1.01-5.91) higher risk of prostate cancer recurrence. Mechanistically, TNFAIP8 seems to function as a scaffold (or adaptor) protein. In the antibody microarray analysis of proteins associated with the TNFAIP8 immune-complex, we have identified Karyopherin alpha2 as a novel binding partner of nuclear TNFAIP8 in PC-3 cells. The Ingenuity Pathway Analysis of the TNFAIP8 interacting proteins suggested that TNFAIP8 influences cancer progression pathways and networks involving integrins and matrix metalloproteinases.

Biochemical pull down assays using secreted GDF-15 and His-tagged CCN2 produced in PC-3 prostate cancer cells confirmed a direct interaction between these proteins. To investigate the functional consequences of this interaction, in vitro angiogenesis assays were performed. We demonstrate that GDF-15 blocks CCN2-mediated tube formation in human umbilical vein endothelial (HUVEC) cells. To examine the molecular mechanism whereby GDF-15 inhibits CCN2-mediated angiogenesis, activation of αV β3 integrins and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) was examined. CCN2-mediated FAK activation was inhibited by GDF-15 and was accompanied by a decrease in αV β3 integrin clustering in HUVEC cells. These results demonstrate, for the first time, a novel signaling pathway for GDF-15 through interaction with the matricellular signaling molecule CCN2.

In vivo MRSI was performed on a 3T clinical MR system and ex vivo HR-MAS on a 14.1T magnet. Relative metabolite concentrations were calculated by LCModel fitting of in vivo spectra and by peak integration of ex vivo spectra. Spearman's rank correlations (ρ) between CCS/C from in vivo and ex vivo MR spectra, and with their corresponding Gleason score, were calculated. There was a strong positive correlation between the Gleason score and CCS/C measured both in vivo and ex vivo (ρ = 0.77 and ρ = 0.69, respectively; p < 0.001), and between in vivo and ex vivo metabolite ratios from spatially matched regions (ρ = 0.67, p < 0.001).

Increased evidence shows that CTCs are often present in metastatic prostate cancer and can be alternative sources for disease profiling and prognostication. Here we postulate that CTCs expressing genes related to epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) are strong predictors of metastatic prostate cancer.  Methods:   A microfiltration system was used to trap CTCs from peripheral blood based on size selection of large epithelial-like cells without CD45 leukocyte marker. These cells individually retrieved with a micromanipulator device were assessed for cell membrane physical properties using atomic force microscopy. Additionally, 38 CTCs from eight prostate cancer patients were used to determine expression profiles of 84 EMT-related and reference genes using a microfluidics-based PCR system.  Results:   Increased cell elasticity and membrane smoothness were found in CTCs compared to noncancerous cells, highlighting their potential invasiveness and mobility in the peripheral circulation. Despite heterogeneous expression patterns of individual CTCs, genes that promote mesenchymal transitioning into a more malignant state, including IGF1, IGF2, EGFR, FOXP3, and TGFB3, were commonly observed in these cells. An additional subset of EMT-related genes (e.g., PTPRN2, ALDH1, ESR2, and WNT5A) were expressed in CTCs of castration-resistant cancer, but less frequently in castration-sensitive cancer.

Such a recurrent nature strongly suggests that these mutations play important roles in tumor development. To see whether SF3B1, U2AF1 and SRSF2 mutations occur in other human tumors besides MDS, we analyzed the hotspot mutation regions of these genes in 2,345 tumor tissues from various origins (61 MDS, other 616 hematologic tumors, 1,421 epithelial tumors and 247 non-epithelial stromal tumors) by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis. We found SF3B1, U2AF1 and SRSF2 mutations in 5 (8.2%), 12 (19.7%) and 8 (13.1%) of 61 MDS, respectively. We also confirmed these mutations in other myeloid neoplasia, including de novo acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), chronic myelomonocytic leukemia and MDS/myeloproliferative disorder. In addition, we discovered that the SRSF2 gene was mutated in two childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemias (childhood ALL) (1.5%). In solid tumors, we found SF3B1 mutations in gastric and prostate cancers, and U2AF1 mutation in a borderline mucinous tumor of ovary, but the overall incidences of the hotspot mutation regions were very low (0.2%). Our data suggest that SF3B1, U2AF1 and SRSF2 mutations occur not only in myeloid lineage tumors but also in lymphoid lineage tumors.

Methods:   Data from 1006 consecutive patients with prostate cancer who received LDR-PB and underwent implantation on or before October 23, 2003 were extracted from a prospective database on November 11, 2011. The selected patients had low-risk (58%) or intermediate-risk (42%) disease according to National Comprehensive Cancer Network criteria. The Phoenix threshold was used to define biochemical relapse. Sixty-five percent of patients received 3 months of neoadjuvant androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) and 3 months of concomitant ADT. Univariate and multivariate analyses are reported in relation to patient, tumor, and treatment variables.  Results:   The median follow-up was 7.5 years. By using Fine and Gray competing risks analysis, the 5-year and 10-year actuarial DFS rates were 96.7% (95% confidence interval, 95.2%-97.7%) and 94.1% (95% confidence interval, 92%-95.6%), respectively. When applied to the whole cohort, none of the usual prognostic variables, including dose metrics, were correlated with DFS. However, in both univariate and multivariate models, increasing dose was the only covariate that correlated with improved DFS for the subset of men (N = 348) who did not receive ADT (P = .043).

This paper discusses colorectal, prostate and stomach cancer in Māori to illustrate selected issues that impact on cancer care. Colorectal cancer is discussed to illustrate the importance of accurate cancer statistics to focus management strategies. Prostate cancer in Māori is reviewed - an area where cultural factors impact on care delivery. Sporadic stomach cancer in New Zealand is used to show how sub-classification of different types of cancer can be important and illustrate the breadth of putative causal factors. Then follows an overview of developments in hereditary gastric cancer in New Zealand in the last 15 years, showing how successful clinical and research partnerships can improve patient outcomes.

AND WHAT DOES THE STUDY ADD?: Multiple treatment alternatives exist for localised prostate cancer, with few high-quality studies directly comparing their comparative effectiveness and costs. The present study is the most comprehensive cost-effectiveness analysis to date for localised prostate cancer, conducted with a lifetime horizon and accounting for survival, health-related quality-of-life, and cost impact of secondary treatments and other downstream events, as well as primary treatment choices. The analysis found minor differences, generally slightly favouring surgical methods, in quality-adjusted life years across treatment options. However, radiation therapy (RT) was consistently more expensive than surgery, and some alternatives, e.g. intensity-modulated RT for low-risk disease, were dominated - that is, both more expensive and less effective than competing alternatives.  Objective:   To characterise the costs and outcomes associated with radical prostatectomy (open, laparoscopic, or robot-assisted) and radiation therapy (RT: dose-escalated three-dimensional conformal RT, intensity-modulated RT, brachytherapy, or combination), using a comprehensive, lifetime decision analytical model.  Patients and methods:   A Markov model was constructed to follow hypothetical men with low-, intermediate-, and high-risk prostate cancer over their lifetimes after primary treatment; probabilities of outcomes were based on an exhaustive literature search yielding 232 unique publications. In each Markov cycle, patients could have remission, recurrence, salvage treatment, metastasis, death from prostate cancer, and death from other causes. Utilities for each health state were determined, and disutilities were applied for complications and toxicities of treatment. Costs were determined from the USA payer perspective, with incorporation of patient costs in a sensitivity analysis.  Results:   Differences across treatments in quality-adjusted life years across methods were modest, ranging from 10.3 to 11.3 for low-risk patients, 9.6-10.5 for intermediate-risk patients and 7.8-9.3 for high-risk patients. There were no statistically significant differences among surgical methods, which tended to be more effective than RT methods, with the exception of combined external beam + brachytherapy for high-risk disease. RT methods were consistently more expensive than surgical methods; costs ranged from $19 901 (robot-assisted prostatectomy for low-risk disease) to $50 276 (combined RT for high-risk disease). These findings were robust to an extensive set of sensitivity analyses.  Conclusions:   Our analysis found small differences in outcomes and substantial differences in payer and patient costs across treatment alternatives. These findings may inform future policy discussions about strategies to improve efficiency of treatment selection for localised prostate cancer.""","""['Matthew R Cooperberg', 'Naren R Ramakrishna', 'Steven B Duff', 'Kathleen E Hughes', 'Sara Sadownik', 'Joseph A Smith', 'Ashutosh K Tewari']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Podcasts made simple.', 'Valuing interventions for localised prostate cancer.', 'Systematic review of the cost effectiveness of radiation therapy for prostate cancer from 2003 to 2013.', 'Cost of New Technologies in Prostate Cancer Treatment: Systematic Review of Costs and Cost Effectiveness of Robotic-assisted Laparoscopic Prostatectomy, Intensity-modulated Radiotherapy, and Proton Beam Therapy.', 'Comparative cost-effectiveness of robot-assisted and standard laparoscopic prostatectomy as alternatives to open radical prostatectomy for treatment of men with localised prostate cancer: a health technology assessment from the perspective of the UK National Health Service.', 'Systematic review and economic modelling of the relative clinical benefit and cost-effectiveness of laparoscopic surgery and robotic surgery for removal of the prostate in men with localised prostate cancer.', 'Modelling the lifetime cost-effectiveness of radical prostatectomy, radiotherapy and active monitoring for men with clinically localised prostate cancer from median 10-year outcomes in the ProtecT randomised trial.', 'Comparison of treatment costs for primary localized prostate cancer in Austria and Vienna: an economic analysis.', 'Cost-effectiveness of an urinary biomarker panel in combination with MRI for prostate cancer diagnosis.', 'Systematic literature review of cost-effectiveness analyses of robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy for localised prostate cancer.', ""The Influence of Practice Structure on Urologists' Treatment of Men With Low-Risk Prostate Cancer."", 'Medical Resource Use and Medical Costs for Radiotherapy-Related Adverse Effects: A Systematic Review.']"""

Given the wealth of structural information on the AR in complex with a variety of ligands, we have applied an integrated structure- and ligand-based virtual screening methodology to identify novel AR antagonists. Virtual hits generated by a consensus voting approach were experimentally evaluated and resulted in the discovery of a number of structurally diverse submicromolar antagonists of the AR.

It is, however, also considered an opportunistic pathogen; mostly associated with acne vulgaris, but rarely also with severe infections such as infective endocarditis, prosthetic joint infections, and deep sternal wound infections following cardiothoracic surgery. In addition, P. acnes has recently been found in high frequency in prostate tissue from patients with prostatitis and prostate cancer. The NOD-like receptors (NLR) act as intracellular sensors of microbial components, and a number of various bacteria have been found to induce assembling and activation of NLR-inflammasomes; leading to a pro-inflammatory response. The inflammasome-mediated formation of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and IL-18 involves the auto-proteolytic maturation of caspase-1. This study investigated if P. acnes activates inflammasomes. Propionibacterium acnes isolates (n = 29) with diverse origin were used as stimuli for peripheral leukocytes obtained from blood donors (BDs). The activity of inflammasomes was determined by measuring caspase-1 by flow cytometry and cytokine production by ELISA. A significant amount of caspase-1 was found in neutrophils upon P. acnes stimulation, whereas only a modest activation was seen in monocytes.

In a Src-inducible model of cellular transformation, metformin inhibits the earliest known step in the process, activation of the inflammatory transcription factor NF-κB. Metformin strongly delays cellular transformation in a manner similar to that occurring upon a weaker inflammatory stimulus. Conversely, inhibition of transformation does not occur if metformin is added after the initial inflammatory stimulus. The antitransformation effect of metformin can be bypassed by overexpression of Lin28B or IL1β, downstream targets of NF-κB. Metformin preferentially inhibits nuclear translocation of NF-κB and phosphorylation of STAT3 in cancer stem cells compared with non-stem cancer cells in the same population. The ability of metformin to block tumor growth and prolong remission in xenografts in combination with doxorubicin is associated with decreased function of the inflammatory feedback loop. Lastly, metformin-based combinatorial therapy is effective in xenografts involving inflammatory prostate and melanoma cell lines, whereas it is ineffective in noninflammatory cell lines from these lineages. Taken together, our observations suggest that metformin inhibits a signal transduction pathway that results in an inflammatory response. As metformin alters energy metabolism in diabetics, we speculate that metformin may block a metabolic stress response that stimulates the inflammatory pathway associated with a wide variety of cancers.""","""['Heather A Hirsch', 'Dimitrios Iliopoulos', 'Kevin Struhl']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A""","""['Metformin selectively targets cancer stem cells, and acts together with chemotherapy to block tumor growth and prolong remission.', 'EC-70124, a Novel Glycosylated Indolocarbazole Multikinase Inhibitor, Reverts Tumorigenic and Stem Cell Properties in Prostate Cancer by Inhibiting STAT3 and NF-κB.', 'Metformin decreases the dose of chemotherapy for prolonging tumor remission in mouse xenografts involving multiple cancer cell types.', ""Pharmacologic mechanisms underlying antidiabetic drug metformin's chemopreventive effect against colorectal cancer."", 'Metformin and the ATM DNA damage response (DDR): accelerating the onset of stress-induced senescence to boost protection against cancer.', 'Mitochondria in colorectal cancer stem cells - a target in drug resistance.', 'The development and benefits of metformin in various diseases.', 'Metformin: A Review of Potential Mechanism and Therapeutic Utility Beyond Diabetes.', 'Metformin is associated with improved clinical outcomes in patients with melanoma: a retrospective, multi-institutional study.', 'Molecular mechanisms of action of metformin: latest advances and therapeutic implications.']"""

However, ADT is without benefit in other situations and can actually cause harm. This study examines recent trends in the ADT use and quantifies the cost of guideline-discordant ADT. Patients and methods Patients, aged 66-80 years, in the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results-Medicare database with non-metastatic prostate cancer diagnosed between 2004 and 2007 were included for analysis. Prostate-specific antigen, Gleason score, and stage were used to define D'Amico risk categories. Logistic regression was used to examine factors associated with guideline-discordant ADT. Annual direct cost was estimated using 2011 Medicare reimbursement for ADT. Results Of 28 654 men included, 12.4% received guideline-discordant ADT. In low-risk patients, 14.9% received discordant ADT, mostly due to simultaneous ADT with radiation. Discordant use was seen in 7.3% of intermediate and 14.9% of high-risk patients, mostly from ADT as primary therapy. The odds of receiving guideline-discordant ADT decreased over time (2007 versus 2004; OR 0.69; 95% CI 0.62-0.76). The estimated annual direct cost from discordant ADT is $42 000 000.

This analysis included 45 eligible studies of a total of 15,562 cases and 15,385 controls, in which no significant associations were found for the V89L polymorphisms under all genetic models. However, small excess prostate cancer risk was associated with the 49T allele in mixed populations compared with the 49A allele (OR = 1.24, 95% CI = 1.02-1.50), and similar results were observed in Caucasians (OR = 1.24, 95% CI = 1.01-1.53). The sensitivity analysis further strengthened the validity of these findings without publication bias. Although there was no overall association between V89L and prostate cancer risk, A49T might play a role in the etiology of prostate cancer among Caucasians.

Of particular interest is the MIER1α isoform, which contains in its unique C-terminus an LXXLL motif for interaction with nuclear hormone receptors. Indeed, MIER1α has been shown to interact with ERα and inhibit estrogen-stimulated growth of breast carcinoma cells. Moreover, the subcellular localization of MIER1α changes dramatically, from nuclear to cytoplasmic, during progression to invasive breast carcinoma. While human MIER1 RNA and protein expression pattern data have been posted on several websites, none of these studies use probes or antibodies that distinguish between the α and β isoforms. We report here the first immunohistochemical study of the MIER1α protein expression pattern in human tissues. Our analysis revealed intense staining of specific cell types within virtually every endocrine and reproductive tissue except for the thyroid gland. In particular, we detected intense staining of ovarian follicles and germinal epithelium, ductal epithelial cells of the breast, pancreatic islet cells, all areas of the anterior pituitary and all zones of the adrenal cortex; moderate staining of germ cells and Leydig cells within the testis, patches of chromaffin cells in the adrenal medulla and weak staining of the fibromuscular stroma within the prostate. Immunoreactivity was limited to the cytoplasm in all positive cells except for oocytes and germinal epithelial cells in which the nucleus was also stained and in ductal epithelial cells of the breast in which staining was exclusively nuclear. In general, non-endocrine tissues were negative, however a few exceptions were noted. These included hepatocytes, myocardial fibers and neurons in all regions of the brain examined, with the exception of the thalamus. Neuronal staining was restricted to the cell bodies and dendrites, as most axons were negative.

Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) in the coding gene has been related to many medical diseases as well as diverse malignancies including the prostate cancer which is the leading cause of the cancer deaths in men and one of the major public health problems. The goal of this study is to determine the relationship between the MTHFR C677T SNP and the prostate adenocarcinoma in Iranian males attending to the Labbafi-nezhad hospital in Tehran. In this Case-control unmatched study, 67 and 75 paraffinized tissue samples were taken out of the specimens diagnosed previously as the prostatic adenocarcinoma and nodular prostatic hyperplasia for the case and control groups respectively. MTHFR C677T genotyping was done by the use of multiplex ARMS-PCR and frequencies of the alleles were compared between the case and control groups as well as calculating the deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and Odds Ratio for the ""T"" allele regarding the prostatic carcinoma. The observed rates in the control group were not too different from that of expected from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (P=0.407). Frequencies of the possible genotypes were as follows: CC, 43.28% vs. 42.67%; CT, 49.25% vs. 52% and CT, 7.46% vs. 5.33% in the case and control groups respectively (P=0.85). 1.37 times increased risk was found for the homozygote carriers of C677T variant (OR: 1.37, 95% CI: 0.33-5.6; P=0.653) which is however statistically not significant. No association has been evident between the MTHFR 677C>T polymorphism and the risk of prostatic carcinoma in this study confirming the findings of some of the previous attempts; however, (OR: 1.37, 95% CI: 0.33-5.6) implies a slight effect of the homozygote on the carcinogenesis.

Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) is a novel approach involving high-dose radiotherapy in 5 fractions. This analysis compared their cost-effectiveness.  Methods:   A Markov model was constructed to delineate the health states after treatment with IMRT and SBRT. Disease, treatment, and toxicity data were extracted from the literature. Costs included both robotic (R-SBRT) and nonrobotic (NR-SBRT) reimbursement. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA) were performed over a wide range of potential parameters.  Results:   The quality-adjusted life expectancy after IMRT was slightly higher than after SBRT, because we assumed worse toxicity after SBRT. However, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) for IMRT over R-SBRT and NR-SBRT were $285,000 and $591,100/quality-adjusted life year (QALY), respectively. On sensitivity analysis, SBRT was almost always the cost-effective therapy, in which the ICER for IMRT was generally over $100,000/QALY. Reimbursement for R-SBRT versus NR-SBRT significantly influenced its ICER. Treatment efficacy, rectal toxicity and impotence, and the potential for unforeseen SBRT late effects were the most critical parameters in the model; when including these uncertain parameters in a PSA, SBRT was still most likely to be cost-effective at a willingness to pay of $100,000/QALY.  Conclusions:   SBRT clearly contained more value than IMRT for external-beam treatment.

We recently reported the development of a novel class of ERMAs that exhibits high potency in eliciting starvation-associated cellular responses and epigenetic changes in cancer cells though glucose uptake inhibition. The lead ERMA in this class, OSU-CG5, decreases the production of ATP and NADH in LNCaP prostate cancer cells. In this study, we examined the effect of OSU-CG5 on the severity of preneoplastic lesions in male transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate (TRAMP) mice. Daily oral treatment with OSU-CG5 at 100 mg/kg from 6 to 10 weeks of age resulted in a statistically significant decrease in the weight of urogenital tract and microdissected dorsal, lateral, and anterior prostatic lobes relative to vehicle controls. The suppressive effect of OSU-CG5 was evidenced by marked decreases in Ki67 immunostaining and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) expression in the prostate. OSU-CG5 treatment was not associated with evidence of systemic toxicity. Microarray analysis indicated a central role for Akt, and Western blot analysis showed reduced phosphorylation and/or expression levels of Akt, Src, androgen receptor, and insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor in prostate lobes.

Of the 2146 patients diagnosed with prostate cancer, 1956 (91.1%), 142 (6.6%), 38 (1.8%), 9 (0.4%) and 1 (0.1%) men were in groups 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, respectively. Groups 4 and 5 were excluded because of the small sample sizes. The remaining three groups (groups 1, 2 and 3) were statistically analyzed. There were no differences in age or prostate-specific antigen level among the three groups. CIPC was detected in 201 (10.3%), 28 (19.7%) and 9 (23.7%) patients in groups 1, 2 and 3, respectively (P<0.001). A multivariate analysis showed that the number of biopsies was an independent predictor to detect CIPC (OR=2.688 for group 2; OR=4.723 for group 3). In conclusion, patients undergoing multiple prostate biopsies are more likely to be diagnosed with CIPC than those who only undergo one biopsy. However, the risk still exists that the patient could have clinically significant prostate cancer. Therefore, when counseling patients with regard to serial repeat biopsies, the possibility of prostate cancer overdiagnosis and overtreatment must be balanced with the continued risk of clinically significant disease.""","""['Bumsoo Park', 'Seong-Soo Jeon', 'Sung-Ho Ju', 'Byong-Chang Jeong', 'Seong-Il Seo', 'Hyun-Moo Lee', 'Han-Yong Choi']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Asian J Androl""","""['When serial prostate biopsy is recommended: most cancers detected are clinically insignificant.', 'A Multicentre Analysis of the Detection of Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer Following Transperineal Image-fusion Targeted and Nontargeted Systematic Prostate Biopsy in Men at Risk.', 'Accuracy of Transperineal Targeted Prostate Biopsies, Visual Estimation and Image Fusion in Men Needing Repeat Biopsy in the PICTURE Trial.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Prostate biopsy: who, how and when.

We assessed whether the presence of a tumor board, either general or cancer specific, was associated with recommended cancer care, outcomes, or use in the Veterans Affairs (VA) health system.  Methods:   We surveyed 138 VA medical centers about the presence of tumor boards and linked cancer registry and administrative data to assess receipt of stage-specific recommended care, survival, or use for patients with colorectal, lung, prostate, hematologic, and breast cancers diagnosed in the period from 2001 to 2004 and followed through 2005. We used multivariable logistic regression to assess associations of tumor boards with the measures, adjusting for patient sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. All statistical tests were two-sided.  Results:   Most facilities (75%) had at least one tumor board, and many had several cancer-specific tumor boards. Presence of a tumor board was associated with only seven of 27 measures assessed (all P < .05), and several associations were not in expected directions. Rates of some recommended care (eg, white blood cell growth factors with cyclophosphamide, adriamycin, vincristine, and prednisone in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma) were lower in centers with hematologic-specialized tumor boards (39.4%) than in centers with general tumor boards (61.3%) or no tumor boards (56.4%; P = .002). Only one of 27 measures was statistically significantly associated with tumor boards after applying a Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons.  Conclusions:   We observed little association of multidisciplinary tumor boards with measures of use, quality, or survival.

All patients underwent RTE of the prostate and 3.0 T endorectal MRI. The investigators were unaware of the clinical data and of each others results.  Results:   RTE detected PC in 46 (92%) and MRI in 42 (84%) of the patients. Depending on the analysis sensitivity was 44.1-58.9% for RTE and 36.7-43.1% for MRI. Specificity was 83.0-74.8% for RTE and 85.9-79.8% for MRI. Sensitivity was significantly higher for RTE (16-sectors: p=0.0348; 8-sectors: p=0.0002) and showed better results in the dorsal (RTE: 51.9%; MRT: 37.7%) and apical to middle (RTE: 66.7%-80.0%; MRI: 41.7%-60.0%) parts of the prostate.

In this study, human PCa PC-3M-luciferase cells (2 × 10(6)) were injected into the prostate of athymic nude mice. Three days post cell implantation, mice were treated with PL (2 mg/kg body wt. i.p. five days in a week) for 8 weeks. Growth and metastasis of PC-3M-luciferase cells was examined weekly by bioluminescence imaging of live mice. PL-treatment significantly (p = 0.0008) inhibited the growth of orthotopic xenograft tumors. Results demonstrated a significant inhibition of metastasis into liver (p = 0.037), but inhibition of metastasis into the lungs (p = 0.60) and lymph nodes (p = 0.27) was not observed to be significant. These results were further confirmed by histopathology of these organs. Results of histopathology demonstrated a significant inhibition of metastasis into lymph nodes (p = 0.034) and lungs (p = 0.028), and a trend to significance in liver (p = 0.075). None of the mice in the PL-treatment group showed PCa metastasis into the liver, but these mice had small metastasis foci into the lymph nodes and lungs. However, control mice had large metastatic foci into the lymph nodes, lungs, and liver. PL-caused inhibition of the growth and metastasis of PC-3M cells accompanies inhibition of the expression of: 1) PKCε, pStat3Tyr705, and pStat3Ser727, 2) Stat3 downstream target genes (survivin and Bcl(xL)), 3) proliferative markers Ki-67 and PCNA, 4) metastatic marker MMP9, MMP2, and uPA, and 5) angiogenesis markers CD31 and VEGF.

Design:   We reviewed reports of 748 consecutive prostate biopsies and we evaluated the turnaround times, the final diagnosis on individual specimens, the intradepartmental consultation rates, and the associated costs.  Results:   Immunohistochemistry evaluation was required for 39.4% of biopsies and 12% of blocks (average 1.8 blocks/case). The biopsies with immunohistochemistry were signed out 1.7 workdays later (8.6 versus 6.9 days). The diagnostic breakdown for individual blocks evaluated by immunohistochemistry was Cancer 47.7%; Atypical, Suspicious 10.8%; Small Atypical Glands Adjacent to High-Grade Prostatic Intraepithelial Neoplasia 6.9%; High-Grade Prostatic Intraepithelial Neoplasia 12.4%; and Benign 22.2%. Diagnoses of Cancer or Atypical, Suspicious (Atypical, Suspicious + Small Atypical Glands Adjacent to High-Grade Prostatic Intraepithelial Neoplasia) were rendered in 65.4% of individual blocks assessed by immunohistochemistry. Immunohistochemistry aided in establishing limited cancer (≤10% of core) in 69.3% of cases and in 74% of single-core-positive biopsies.

Methods:   Periostin (POSTN) expression in prostate cancer (PCa) and in normal specimens was evaluated in 90 patients by an immuno-reactive score(IRS) based on the intensity of immunostaining and on the quantity of stained cells. The t-test was applied to compare IRS values in cancer specimens to values in normal specimens. Pearson's test was used to correlate POSTN expression to clinical pathologic features. PSA progression-free and survival curves were constructed by the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the log-rank test. Multi-parametric models were constructed according to the Cox technique adding all the covariates predicting for either PSA progression or death into the models after univariate analysis.  Results:   Both stromal and epithelial POSTN expression were significantly increased in tumor tissues. In particular, we found stromal expression to be significantly higher than epithelial expression as compared to normal tissues (p<0.000 and p=0.001).A significant correlation between POSTN epithelial expression and extra-prostatic extension was found (p=0.03). While high stromal expression was significantly associated with shorter survival (p=0.008), a low epithelial score significantly correlated with shorter PSA-free survival (p=0.04), suggesting that POSTN plays an apparently opposing biological role depending on its compartmentalization.Regardless of the mechanism that is involved, patients showing both high stromal and low epithelial expression made up a subgroup with a very bleak prognosis.

Materials and methods:   The incidence of patient complaints about reduced penile size was calculated for 948 men in the Comprehensive, Observational, Multicenter, Prostate Adenocarcinoma (COMPARE) registry who experienced biochemical failure (per registry definition) and were assessed a median of 5.53 years after prostatectomy or radiotherapy (RT) consisting of either external beam RT or brachytherapy, with or without androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to determine the factors associated with treatment regret and interference with emotional relationships.  Results:   Of 948 men, 25 (2.63%) complained of a reduced penile size. The incidence of reduced penile size stratified by treatment was 3.73% for surgery (19 of 510), 2.67% for RT plus ADT (6 of 225), and 0% for RT without ADT (0 of 213). The surgery (P=.004) and RT plus ADT (P=.016) groups had significantly more shortened penis complaints than the RT alone group. The rate of a shortened penis after surgery and after RT plus ADT was similar (P=.47). On multivariate analysis adjusting for age, treatment type, and baseline comorbidity, a perceived reduction in penile size was associated with interference with close emotional relationships (odds ratio 2.36, 95% confidence interval 1.02-8.26; P=.04) and increased treatment regret (odds ratio 3.37, 95% confidence interval 1.37-8.26; P=.0079).

Materials and methods:   Between 2006 and 2009, 770 patients underwent TRUS-guided prostate biopsies in our academic center. During the 6 semesters of this period, 24 residents (4 per semester) performed 1 session of 5.6±1.5 procedures each month for a total of 33.6±9 procedures during the study. The first session was performed with a senior urologist. Prostate cancer detection rate and standards of quality (average length of prostatic core biopsy specimens and absence of prostatic tissue) were retrospectively studied between the beginning and the end of each semester.  Results:   A total of 12,760 biopsy cores were performed for 770 procedures. Mean patient age (64.5±6.1 years), and median prostate-specific antigen (8.7±3.7 ng/mL) were comparable between the study periods. The average length of biopsy cores significantly improved (+10%) from the first (12±2.7 mm) to the last month (13.2±2.1 mm) with a plateau after 12 procedures. Overall, cancer detection rate was 47% and was stable during the semester (41.3% the first month vs 44.1% the last month; P=.39). On univariate and multivariate analysis the mean length of biopsy specimens was associated with the number of procedures (P<.001) and the number of cores performed (P<.001).

In the characterization of effects of ST3-H2A2, a selective inhibitor of the STAT3 N-terminal domain (ND), we observed that the compound induced apoptotic death in cancer cells associated with robust activation of proapoptotic genes. Using ChIP and tiling human promoter arrays, we found that activation of gene expression in response to ST3-H2A2 is accompanied by altered STAT3 chromatin binding. Using inhibitors of STAT3 phosphorylation and a dominant-negative STAT3 mutant, we found that the unphosphorylated form of STAT3 binds to regulatory regions of proapoptotic genes and prevents their expression in tumor cells but not normal cells. siRNA knockdown confirmed the effects of ST3-HA2A on gene expression and chromatin binding to be STAT3 dependent. The STAT3-binding region of the C/EBP-homologous protein (CHOP) promoter was found to be localized in DNaseI hypersensitive site of chromatin in cancer cells but not in nontransformed cells, suggesting that STAT3 binding and suppressive action can be chromatin structure dependent.

We evaluated the interactions of BIC with CYP46A1 by x-ray crystallography and by conducting solution and mutagenesis studies. Because BIC is administered to patients as a racemic mixture of the S and R isomers, we studied all three, racemic BIC as well as the S and R isomers. Co-crystallization of CYP46A1 with racemic BIC led to structure determinations at 2.1 Å resolution with the drug complexes exhibiting novel properties. Both BIC isomers bind to the CYP46A1 active site in very similar single orientation and adopt an energetically unfavorable folded conformation. This folded BIC conformation is correlated with drug-induced localized shifts of amino acid side chains in CYP46A1 and unusual interactions in the CYP46A1-BIC complex. One of these interactions involves a water molecule that is coordinated to the P450 heme iron and also hydrogen-bonded to the BIC nitrile. Due to polarization of the water in this environment, the heme elicits previously unreported types of P450 spectral responses.

There is public concern that exposures may have resulted in increased cancers.  Objective:   To evaluate cancer incidence among persons enrolled in the World Trade Center Health Registry.  Design, setting, and participants:   Observational study of 55,778 New York State residents enrolled in the World Trade Center Health Registry in 2003-2004, including rescue/recovery workers (n = 21,850) and those not involved in rescue/recovery (n = 33,928), who were followed up from enrollment through December 31, 2008. Within-cohort comparisons using Cox proportional hazards models assessed the relationship between intensity of World Trade Center exposure and selected cancers.  Main outcome measures:   Cases were identified through linkage with 11 state cancer registries. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) adjusted for age, race/ethnicity, and sex were computed with 2003-2008 New York State rates as the reference, focusing on cancers diagnosed in 2007-2008 as being most likely to be related to exposure during September 11 and its aftermath. The total and site-specific incidence rate differences (RDs) per 100,000 person-years between the study population and the New York State population in 2007-2008 also were calculated.  Results:   There were 1187 incident cancers diagnosed, with an accumulated 253,269 person-years (439 cancers among rescue/recovery workers and 748 among those not involved in rescue/recovery). The SIR for all cancer sites combined in 2007-2008 was not significantly elevated (SIR, 1.14 [95% CI, 0.99 to 1.30]; RD, 67 [95% CI, -6 to 126] per 100,000 person-years among rescue/recovery workers vs SIR, 0.92 [95% CI, 0.83 to 1.03]; RD, -45 [95% CI, -106 to 15] per 100,000 person-years among those not involved in rescue/recovery). Among rescue/recovery workers, the SIRs had significantly increased by 2007-2008 for 3 cancer sites and were 1.43 (95% CI, 1.11 to 1.82) for prostate cancer (n = 67; RD, 61 [95% CI, 20 to 91] per 100,000 person-years), 2.02 (95% CI, 1.07 to 3.45) for thyroid cancer (n = 13; RD, 16 [95% CI, 2 to 23] per 100,000 person-years), and 2.85 (95% CI, 1.15 to 5.88) for multiple myeloma (n = 7; RD, 11 [95% CI, 2 to 14] per 100,000 person-years). No increased incidence was observed in 2007-2008 among those not involved in rescue/recovery. Using within-cohort comparisons, the intensity of World Trade Center exposure was not significantly associated with cancer of the lung, prostate, thyroid, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, or hematological cancer in either group.

Here, we determined how the tumourigenic phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT), tumour-suppressive phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) pathways are integrated via the metastasis suppressor, N-myc downstream-regulated gene-1 (NDRG1). Moreover, we assessed how the novel anti-tumour agent, Dp44mT, may target these integrated pathways by increasing NDRG1 expression.  Methods:   Protein expression in Dp44mT-treated normal human prostate epithelial cells and prostate cancer cells (PC-3, DU145) was assessed by western blotting. The role of NDRG1 was examined by transfection using an NDRG1 overexpression vector or shRNA.  Results:   Dp44mT increased levels of tumour-suppressive PTEN, and decreased phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and SMAD2L, which are regulated by oncogenic Ras/MAPK signalling. Importantly, the effects of Dp44mT on NDRG1 and p-SMAD2L expression were more marked in prostate cancer cells than normal prostate epithelial cells. This may partly explain the anti-tumour selectivity of these agents. Silencing NDRG1 expression increased phosphorylation of tumourigenic AKT, ERK1/2 and SMAD2L and decreased PTEN levels, whereas NDRG1 overexpression induced the opposite effect. Furthermore, NDRG1 silencing significantly reduced the ability of Dp44mT to suppress p-SMAD2L and p-ERK1/2 levels.

Objective:   To determine whether the use of metformin would be associated with improved clinical outcomes and a reduction in the development of CRPC.  Design, setting, and participants:   Data from 2901 consecutive patients (157 metformin, 162 diabetic non-metformin, and 2582 nondiabetic) with localized prostate cancer treated with external-beam radiation therapy from 1992 to 2008 were collected from a single institution in the United States.  Intervention:   Use of metformin in localized prostate cancer.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Univariate and multivariate regression models utilizing k-sample, Fine and Gray, Cox regression, log-rank, and Kaplan-Meier methods to assess prostate-specific antigen-recurrence-free survival (PSA-RFS), distant metastases-free survival (DMFS), prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM), overall survival (OS), and development of CRPC.  Results and limitations:   With a median follow-up of 8.7 yr, the 10-yr actuarial rates for metformin, diabetic non-metformin, and nondiabetic patients for PCSM were 2.7%, 21.9%, and 8.2% (log-rank p ≤ 0.001), respectively. Metformin use independently predicted (correcting for PSA, T stage, Gleason score, age, diabetic status, and androgen-deprivation therapy use) improvement in all outcomes compared with the diabetic non-metformin group; PSA-RFS (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.99 [1.24-3.18]; p=0.004), DMFS (adjusted HR: 3.68 [1.78-7.62]; p<0.001), and PCSM (HR: 5.15 [1.53-17.35]; p=0.008). Metformin use was also independently associated with a decrease in the development of CRPC in patients experiencing biochemical failure compared with diabetic non-metformin patients (odds ratio: 14.81 [1.83-119.89]; p=0.01). The retrospective study design was the primary limitation of the study.  Conclusions:   To our knowledge, our results are the first clinical data to indicate that metformin use may improve PSA-RFS, DMFS, PCSM, OS, and reduce the development of CRPC in prostate cancer patients.

Materials and methods:   We performed a retrospective descriptive study, based on the medical records of patients managed for prostate cancer during a period of six years and a half from January 1, 2004, to June 30, 2010. All records of inpatients and outpatients managed for prostate cancer were collected. Data collection was performed through a standardized survey form, and included the following parameters: age, presence or absence of known history of prostate cancer in siblings, circumstances of discovery, clinical and paraclinical examination, histology and therapeutic modalities.  Results:   We studied the records of 164 patients with prostate cancer. The mean age of our patients was 65years, ranging from 43 to 96years. The circumstances of diagnosis were mostly due to lower urinary tract symptoms. Digital rectal examination was suggestive in 87% of cases, and PSA levels were high in 100% of cases, ranging from 5.88ng/ml to 21,660ng/ml, with a mean of 1447.57ng/ml. Half of the patients had PSA levels greater than or equal to 100ng/ml. The most common histological type was adenocarcinoma. During the study period, 49 radical prostatectomies were performed. The mean PSA levels of patients who underwent a prostatectomy were 23.4ng/ml. Radical retropubic prostatectomy was performed in 35 patients, and radical perineal prostatectomy was performed in 10 cases. Pulpectomy was the method most commonly used in metastatic prostate cancer; it was performed in 48 patients. After resistance to castration, antiandrogens were reintroduced in 13 patients, and diethylstilbestrol in four patients. Only two patients underwent a taxane-based chemotherapy regimen.

This study aimed to investigate the prognostic value of combining tri-marker together in patients with intermediate-risk prostate cancer after surgery.  Methods:   Expression levels of c-Myc, EZH2 and p27 in 129 patients with intermediate-risk prostate cancer were assessed using immunohistochemistry in a semi-quantitative manner. The expression profiles of these three markers were analyzed and investigated for association with biochemical recurrence.  Results:   In all, fifty of 129 cases experienced biochemical recurrence during a median follow-up time of 31 months (range, 6 - 60 months). Of these relapse patients, one case without and 10 cases with any single positive marker were observed; 39 cases were detected with any two or all three positive markers (22 cases with any two and 17 cases with all three positive markers). Survival analysis showed that patients with over-expression of c-Myc or EZH2, and lower expression of p27 manifested significantly higher biochemical recurrence rates. Subsequent multivariate analysis revealed that c-Myc, EZH2 and p27 expression statuses showed potential in predicting relapse, respectively. Notably, combining three markers together as a ""composite index"" (0 or 1, vs. 2 or 3 positive markers) provided powerful prognostic value (HR 6.57, 95% CI 3.02 - 14.31, P < 0.001). There was a significant difference between the patient subgroups with 0 or 1 and those with 2 or 3 positive markers expression statuses, and tri-marker composite index was an independent risk factor for predicting relapse in patients with intermediate-risk prostate cancer after surgery.

Theoretically, BPH patients may have an increased risk of bladder cancer because residual urine in the bladder surely increases the contact time between urinary excreted carcinogens and the urothelium. However, whether BPH increases bladder cancer risk in patients with type 2 diabetes has not been studied.  Methods:   The reimbursement databases of all Taiwanese diabetic patients under oral anti-diabetic agents or insulin from 1996 to 2009 were retrieved from the National Health Insurance. An entry date was set at 1 January 2006 and a total of 547584 men with type 2 diabetes were followed up for bladder cancer incidence until the end of 2009. Incidences of bladder cancer for BPH by status and by duration were calculated and adjusted hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) were estimated by Cox regression. The effects of diabetes duration and medications used for diabetic control in relation with bladder cancer risk were also evaluated by Cox regression in BPH men.  Results:   The incidences were 258.77 and 69.34 per 100,000 person-years for patients with and without BPH, respectively, adjusted hazard ratio 1.794 (1.572, 2.047). For BPH patients, those who underwent surgical procedures for BPH had a higher incidence than those who did not (355.45 vs. 250.09 per 100,000 person-years), respective adjusted hazard ratios: 2.459 (1.946, 3.109) and 1.709 (1.492, 1.958). The significantly higher risk could be demonstrated for BPH of any duration: respective adjusted hazard ratios 1.750 (1.430, 1.605), 1.844 (1.543, 2.203), 2.011 (1.680, 2.406) and 1.605 (1.341, 1.921) for BPH <1, 1-3, 3-5 and ≥ 5 years versus patients without BPH. Sensitivity analyses for patients aged ≥ 60 years and after excluding BPH patients with surgical procedures or without surgical procedures, respectively, yielded similar results. In BPH men, diabetes duration was not significantly related with bladder cancer; but metformin was consistently associated with a significantly lower risk, with adjusted hazard ratio of 0.719 (0.590, 0.875) for all ages and 0.742 (0.604, 0.912) for age ≥ 60 years.

However, it is difficult to localize the prostate in CT images due to low image contrast, unpredicted motion and large appearance variations across different treatment days. To address these issues, we propose a sparse representation based classification method to accurately segment the prostate. The main contributions of this paper are: (1) A discriminant dictionary learning technique is proposed to overcome the limitation of the traditional Sparse Representation based classifier (SRC). (2) Context features are incorporated into SRC to refine the prostate boundary in an iterative scheme.

To segment the prostate, the new treatment image is first rigidly aligned to the planning image space based on the pelvic bones. Then two sets of location-adaptive SRCs along two coordinate directions are applied on the aligned treatment image to produce a probability map, based on which all previously segmented images of the same patient are rigidly aligned onto the new treatment image and majority voting strategy is further adopted to finally segment the prostate in the new treatment image.

However, accurate prostate segmentation in CT images remains as a challenging problem mainly due to three issues: Low image contrast, large prostate motions, and image appearance variations caused by bowel gas. In this paper, a new patient-specific prostate segmentation method is proposed to address these three issues. The main contributions of our method lie in the following aspects: (1) A new patch based representation is designed in the discriminative feature space to effectively distinguish voxels belonging to the prostate and non-prostate regions. (2) The new patch based representation is integrated with a new sparse label propagation framework to segment the prostate, where candidate voxels with low patch similarity can be effectively removed based on sparse representation. (3) An online update mechanism is adopted to capture more patient-specific information from treatment images scanned in previous treatment days. The proposed method has been extensively evaluated on a prostate CT image dataset consisting of 24 patients with 330 images in total. It is also compared with several state-of-the-art prostate segmentation approaches, and experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method can achieve higher segmentation accuracy than other methods under comparison.""","""['Shu Liao', 'Yaozong Gao', 'Dinggang Shen']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Med Image Comput Comput Assist Interv""","""['Sparse patch-based label propagation for accurate prostate localization in CT images.', 'A feature-based learning framework for accurate prostate localization in CT images.', 'Prostate segmentation by sparse representation based classification.', 'Locally-constrained boundary regression for segmentation of prostate and rectum in the planning CT images.', 'Review of automatic pulmonary lobe segmentation methods from CT.', 'FCN Based Label Correction for Multi-Atlas Guided Organ Segmentation.', 'Liver segmentation from CT images using a sparse priori statistical shape model (SP-SSM).', 'Combining Population and Patient-Specific Characteristics for Prostate Segmentation on 3D CT Images.', 'Robust Cell Detection of Histopathological Brain Tumor Images Using Sparse Reconstruction and Adaptive Dictionary Selection.', 'Multi-atlas learner fusion: An efficient segmentation approach for large-scale data.']"""

We hypothesized dual inhibition of different pathways in PCa results in improved tumor inhibition. The Src family kinases (SFK) and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) signaling axes are aberrantly activated in both primary PCa and bone metastases and regulate distinct and overlapping functions in PCa progression. We examined the antitumor effects of combined inhibition of these pathways.  Materials and methods:   Src andIGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) inhibition was achieved in vitro by short hairpin (sh)RNA and in vitro and in vivo by small molecule inhibitors (dasatinib and BMS-754807, against SFK and IGF-1R/Insulin Receptor(IR), respectively).  Results:   In vitro, inhibition of IGF-1 signaling affected cell survival and proliferation. SFK blockade alone had modest effects on proliferation, but significantly enhanced the IGF-1R blockade. These findings correlated with a robust inhibition of IGF-1-induced Akt1 phophorylation by dasatinib, whereas Akt2 phosphorylation was SFK independent and only inhibited by BMS-754807. Thus, complete inhibition of both Akt genes, not seen by either drug alone, is likely a major mechanism for the decreased survival of PCa cells. Furthermore, dasatinib and BMS-754807 inhibited in vivo growth of the primary human xenograft MDA PCa 133, with corresponding inhibition of Akt in tumors. Also, both orthotopic and intratibial tumor growth of PC-3 cells were more potently inhibited by dual SFK and IGF-1R/IR blockade compared to either pathway alone, with a corresponding decrease in bone turnover markers.

However, expression studies on human prostate cancer samples are unclear on the role this protein plays in this disease. We have used in vivo genetic studies in the embryo and adult to extend our understanding of the role of β-Catenin in the normal and neoplastic prostate. Our gene deletion analysis revealed that prostate epithelial β-Catenin is required for embryonic prostate growth and branching but is dispensable in the normal adult organ. During development, β-Catenin controls the number of progenitors in the epithelial buds and regulates a discrete network of genes, including c-Myc and Nkx3.1. Deletion of β-Catenin in a Pten deleted model of castration-resistant prostate cancer demonstrated it is dispensable for disease progression in this setting. Complementary overexpression experiments, through in vivo protein stabilization, showed that β-Catenin promotes the formation of squamous epithelia during prostate development, even in the absence of androgens. β-Catenin overexpression in combination with Pten loss was able to drive progression to invasive carcinoma together with squamous metaplasia. These studies demonstrate that β-Catenin is essential for prostate development and that an inherent property of high levels of this protein in prostate epithelia is to drive squamous fate differentiation. In addition, they show that β-Catenin overexpression can promote invasive prostate cancer in a clinically relevant model of this disease.

We showed that CYLD was a DUB for Akt and suppressed growth factor-mediated ubiquitination and activation of Akt. CYLD directly removed ubiquitin moieties from Akt under serum-starved conditions. CYLD dissociated from Akt upon growth factor stimulation, thereby allowing E3 ligases to induce ubiquitination and activation of Akt. CYLD deficiency also promoted cancer cell proliferation, survival, glucose uptake, and, when injected into mice, growth of prostate tumors.

An article in the current issue (Am J Epidemiol. 2013;177(3):202-212) reports that classic dermatological manifestations, typically associated with chronic arsenic exposure, are predictive of internal cancers among Taiwanese decades after the cessation of exposure. Specifically, the risk of lung and urothelial cancers was elevated, which was evident regardless of arsenic dose, smoking, and age. There was also an unexpected elevated risk of prostate cancer. Despite some methodological limitations, these findings underscore the need for assessing whether dermatological manifestations are also predictive of cardiovascular, respiratory, and other arsenic-related, long-term health consequences. Given the emerging evidence of arsenic exposure from dietary sources beyond contaminated drinking water and occupational and environmental settings, and also because the vast majority of diseases and deaths among exposed populations do not show classic dermatological manifestations, larger and more comprehensive investigations of the health effects of arsenic exposure, especially at lower doses, are needed. In parallel, because the risk of known arsenic-related health outcomes remains elevated decades after exposure cessation, research toward identification of early clinical and biological markers of long-term risk as well as avenues for prevention, in addition to policy actions for exposure reductions, is warranted.""","""['Habibul Ahsan', 'Craig Steinmaus']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Am J Epidemiol""","""['Hsu and Chen respond to ""implications for prevention and future research"".', 'Use of arsenic-induced palmoplantar hyperkeratosis and skin cancers to predict risk of subsequent internal malignancy.', 'Re: ""use of arsenic-induced palmoplantar hyperkeratosis and skin cancers to predict risk of subsequent internal malignancy"".', 'Use of arsenic-induced palmoplantar hyperkeratosis and skin cancers to predict risk of subsequent internal malignancy.', 'Hsu and Chen respond to ""implications for prevention and future research"".', 'Chronic exposure of arsenic via drinking water and its adverse health impacts on humans.', 'A global health problem caused by arsenic from natural sources.', 'Patient-Reported Outcomes of Arsenic-Related Skin Lesions in China.', 'The mechanistic basis of arsenicosis: pathogenesis of skin cancer.']"""

This loss of E-cadherin expression is also required during normal embryogenesis and similar transcriptional repressors have been identified in both processes. We have previously reported the presence of one such transcription factor, WT1 in high Gleason grade prostate tumor tissues, and its absence in non-neoplastic or benign prostatic hyperplasia tissues.  Results:   To better understand the effect of WT1 on E-cadherin expression and migration of PCa cells we quantified WT1 and E-cadherin mRNA levels in normal prostate epithelial and PCa cell lines with varying migratory potential. In WT1 transfected cells E-cadherin transcript levels were decreased, while they were increased in siWT1-RNA transfected PCa cells, suggesting that elevated WT1 expression was sufficient to dampen E-cadherin levels and potentially enhance migratory ability. To delineate the mechanism of WT1-mediated repression of E-cadherin, potential WT1 binding sites were tested in vitro and in vivo binding of WT1 to the E-cadherin promoter in the chromatin of LNCaP and PC3 cells was assessed by Chromatin Immunoprecipitation. The effect of WT1 binding was measured in reporter assays; in PC3 and DU145 cells WT1 decreased the activity of the proximal E-cadherin promoter. Using site-directed mutagenesis, a newly identified WT1 binding site located 146 bp from the transcription start site was shown to be required for this repression by WT1. Transwell migration and wound healing assays revealed that in LNCaP cells with low migratory potential, over-expression of WT1 was sufficient to enhance migration, conversely, in the highly migratory PC3 cells silencing of WT1 decreased migration.  Conclusions:   These findings suggested that WT1 expression in high grade prostate cancer may contribute to migration and metastasis. Thus, in prostate cancer WT1 may function as a novel oncogene facilitating development of the lethal metastatic phenotype.""","""['Adina Brett', 'Sony Pandey', 'Gail Fraizer']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Mol Cancer""","""[""Wilms' tumor 1 (WT1) promotes ovarian cancer progression by regulating E-cadherin and ERK1/2 signaling."", ""Transcriptional regulation of the androgen signaling pathway by the Wilms' tumor suppressor gene WT1."", 'Down-regulation of E-cadherin enhances prostate cancer chemoresistance via Notch signaling.', 'Functional Role of WT1 in Prostate Cancer.', 'WT1/EGR1-mediated control of STIM1 expression and function in cancer cells.', 'Sex-specific genetic variants associated with adult-onset inguinal hernia in a Taiwanese population.', 'The ELF3 transcription factor is associated with an epithelial phenotype and represses epithelial-mesenchymal transition.', 'WT1: The Hinge Between Anemia Correction and Cancer Development in Chronic Kidney Disease.', 'Reduced NCOR2 expression accelerates androgen deprivation therapy failure in prostate cancer.', 'Declining levels of miR-382-3p at puberty trigger the onset of spermatogenesis.']"""

Included is a presentation of the design of the system and its user interface, evaluation of MR-compatibility, and quantitative evaluation of guidance accuracy and repeatability within the bore of a clinical MRI scanner.  Methods:   The use of MRI for visualization of tumors, intraoperative visualization of interventional tools, and thermometry for controlled ablation of lesions is becoming increasingly prevalent. In this work, the authors present a prototype system for guiding needles to prostate tumors within the bore of an MRI scanner for use in focal laser thermal ablation of prostate tumors. The system consists of a manually actuated trajectory alignment device that allows a physician to precisely align a set of needle guides with an intended target in the prostate within the bore of a clinical closed-bore MRI scanner. Needle insertion is then performed transperineally, with the patient in the bore of the MRI, and custom software provides monitoring of thermal ablative procedures.  Results:   The system is shown to have a minimal effect on image distortion, and only a 6% decrease in image signal-to-noise ratio. Through needle insertion tests in tissue-mimicking phantoms, the system's potential for reliably guiding needles to intra-MR targets within 2.64 mm has been demonstrated. Use of the system to deliver focal laser ablation therapy to two patients showed that it can be used to deliver needles with minimal disruption of workflow, and in less time than when insertions are performed freehand or with a fixed grid template.  Conclusions:   A system for delivering needles to a patient's prostate for focal therapy within the bore of an MRI scanner has been developed. Results from needle insertion tests in phantoms suggest that the system has the potential to provide accurate delivery of focal therapy to prostate tumors of the smallest clinically significant size. Initial tests in two patients showed that needle deflection was larger than in phantoms, but methods of manually compensating for this effect were employed and needles were delivered to treatment sites with sufficient accuracy to deliver effective treatment. In addition, the treatment was delivered in less time than with a fixed grid template or freehand insertions. Despite this success, methods of reducing needle deflection are needed in order to fully utilize the potential of this system, and further reduce total procedure time.""","""['Jeremy Cepek', 'Blaine A Chronik', 'Uri Lindner', 'John Trachtenberg', 'Sean R H Davidson', 'Jeffrey Bax', 'Aaron Fenster']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Mechatronic system for in-bore MRI-guided insertion of needles to the prostate: An in vivo needle guidance accuracy study.', 'An ultra-high field strength MR image-guided robotic needle delivery system for in-bore small animal interventions.', 'Toward mechatronic MRI-guided focal laser ablation of the prostate: Robust registration for improved needle delivery.', 'Targeted prostate biopsy and MR-guided therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Prostate cancer: state of the art imaging and focal treatment.', 'Preliminary Study of a Modular MR-Compatible Robot for Image-Guided Insertion of Multiple Needles.', 'IDEAL Stage 2a experience with in-office, transperineal MRI/ultrasound software fusion targeted prostate biopsy.', 'Role of multiparametric MRI in long-term surveillance following focal laser ablation of prostate cancer.', 'Robotic System for MRI-guided Focal Laser Ablation in the Prostate.', 'MRI-Guided Robotically Assisted Focal Laser Ablation of the Prostate Using Canine Cadavers.']"""

Here the authors evaluate the overlap volume histogram (OVH) metric as a means to predict the rectal dose following hydrogel injection. Whether OVH predicted dose can serve as the dose objective or constraint for automated treatment planning was also investigated.  Methods:   Treatment planning was performed on 21 prostate cancer patients both pre- and posthydrogel injection, with five-field IMRT delivering 78 Gy to the planning target volume (PTV). The authors quantify the geometrical relationship between the rectum and the prostate PTV using an OVH metric which determines the fractional volume of the rectum that is within a specified distance of the PTV. For an OVH distance the authors selected, L(20), the PTV expansion distance at which 20% of the rectum overlaps. The authors calculated the rectal dose, D(20), received by 20% of the rectum volume on the dose volume histogram. Linear regression was used to examine the correlation between the L(20) and D(20), and between ΔL(20) and ΔD(20) (i.e., the change of L(20) and D(20) posthydrogel injection). Additionally, rectal dose D(15), D(25), D(35), D(50), and bladder dose D(15) were predicted from the OVH (L(15), L(25), L(35), L(50), for rectum and L(15) for bladder) by the L(x)-D(x) linear regression. The predicted doses were applied to the objectives for automated treatment planning of ten plans from five patients. Automatically generated plans were compared with plans manually generated on trial-and-error basis.  Results:   The rectal L(20) was increased and dose D(20) decreased due to the enlarged separation of rectum caused by the hydrogel injection. Linear regression showed an inverse linear correlation between L(20) and D(20), and between ΔL(20) and ΔD(20) (r(2) = 0.77, 0.60, respectively; p < 0.0001). The increase in rectal sparing (ΔD(20)) is only weakly correlated with the volume of injected hydrogel (r(2) = 0.17; p = 0.07), indicating OVH is a more predictive indicator of rectal sparing than the volume of hydrogel itself. Application of the predicted rectum and bladder doses to automated planning produced acceptable treatment plans, with rectal dose reduced for eight of ten plans.  Conclusions:   The OVH metric can predict the rectal dose in the external beam prostate radiotherapy for patients with hydrogel injection. The predicted doses can be applied to the objectives of optimization in automated treatment planning to produce acceptable treatment plans.""","""['Yidong Yang', 'Eric C Ford', 'Binbin Wu', 'Michael Pinkawa', 'Baukelien van Triest', 'Patrick Campbell', 'Danny Y Song', 'Todd R McNutt']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['An improved distance-to-dose correlation for predicting bladder and rectum dose-volumes in knowledge-based VMAT planning for prostate cancer.', 'Maximizing rectal dose sparing with hydrogel: A retrospective planning study.', 'Relationship between pelvic organ-at-risk dose and clinical target volume in postprostatectomy patients receiving intensity-modulated radiotherapy.', 'Dose-volume analysis of predictors for chronic rectal toxicity after treatment of prostate cancer with adaptive image-guided radiotherapy.', 'Absorbable Hydrogel Spacer Use in Prostate Radiotherapy: A Comprehensive Review of Phase 3 Clinical Trial Published Data.', 'deepPERFECT: Novel Deep Learning CT Synthesis Method for Expeditious Pancreatic Cancer Radiotherapy.', 'Direct Dose Prediction With Deep Learning for Postoperative Cervical Cancer Underwent Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy.', 'A novel knowledge-based prediction model for estimating an initial equivalent uniform dose in semi-auto-planning for cervical cancer.', 'Automatic treatment planning for cervical cancer radiation therapy using direct three-dimensional patient anatomy match.', 'Finite Element-Based Personalized Simulation of Duodenal Hydrogel Spacer: Spacer Location Dependent Duodenal Sparing and a Decision Support System for Spacer-Enabled Pancreatic Cancer Radiation Therapy.']"""

This work is an evaluation of Acuros XB, by comparison with Monte Carlo, for dose calculation applications involving high-density materials. Existing non-Monte Carlo clinical dose calculation algorithms, such as the analytic anisotropic algorithm (AAA), do not accurately model dose perturbations due to increased electron scatter within high-density volumes.  Methods:   Acuros XB, AAA, and EGSnrc based Monte Carlo are used to calculate dose distributions from 18 MV and 6 MV photon beams delivered to a cubic water phantom containing a rectangular high density (4.0-8.0 g/cm(3)) volume at its center. The algorithms are also used to recalculate a clinical prostate treatment plan involving a unilateral hip prosthesis, originally evaluated using AAA.

Results:   Using a 2% and 1 mm gamma-analysis, between 91.3% and 96.8% of Acuros XB dose voxels containing greater than 50% the normalized dose were in agreement with Monte Carlo data for virtual phantoms involving 18 MV and 6 MV photons, stainless steel and titanium alloy implants and for on-axis and oblique field delivery.

A generic RBE = 1.1 is generally used for isoeffect calculations, while experimental studies showed that proton RBE varies with tissue type, dose, and linear energy transfer (LET).  Methods:   An analytical expression for the LET and α∕β dependence of the linear-quadratic (LQ) model has been used for proton simulations in parallel with the assumption of a generic RBE = 1.1. Calculations have been performed for ranges of LET values and fractionation sensitivities to describe clinically relevant cases, such as the treatment of head and neck and prostate tumors. Isoeffect calculations were compared with predictions from a generic RBE value and reported clinical results.  Results:   The generic RBE = 1.1 appears to be a reasonable estimate for the proton RBE of rapidly growing tissues irradiated with low LET radiation. However, the use of a variable RBE predicts larger differences for tissues with low α∕β (both tumor and normal) and at low doses per fraction. In some situations these differences may appear in contrast to the findings from photon studies highlighting the importance of accurate accounting for the radiobiological effectiveness of protons. Furthermore, the use of variable RBE leads to closer predictions to clinical results.  Conclusions:   The LET dependence of the RBE has a strong impact on the predicted effectiveness of fractionated proton radiotherapy. The magnitude of the effect is modulated by the fractionation sensitivity and the fractional dose indicating the need for accurate analyses both in the target and around it. Care should therefore be employed for changing clinical fractionation patterns or when analyzing results from clinical studies for this type of radiation.""","""['Alexandru Dasu', 'Iuliana Toma-Dasu']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Inclusion of a variable RBE into proton and photon plan comparison for various fractionation schedules in prostate radiation therapy.', 'Clinical consequences of relative biological effectiveness variations in proton radiotherapy of the prostate, brain and liver.', 'Investigating the Implications of a Variable RBE on Proton Dose Fractionation Across a Clinical Pencil Beam Scanned Spread-Out Bragg Peak.', 'Relative biological effectiveness (RBE) values for proton beam therapy.

The common goal of all currently competing diagnostic strategies and approaches is the prevention of renal scars by the most effective and least burdensome approach. There is a difference between acquired pyelonephritic scars with VUR (acquired reflux nephropathy) and congenital reflux nephropathy (primary dysplasia) which cannot be influenced by any therapy.The VUR can be verified by conventional radiological voiding cystourethrography (VCUG), by urosonography, radionuclide cystography or even by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The guidelines of the European Association of Urology/European Society for Paediatric Urology (EAU/ESPU) recommend radiological screening for VUR after the first febrile urinary tract infection. Significant risk factors in patients with VUR are recurrent urinary tract infections (UTI) and parenchymal scarring and the patients should undergo patient and risk-adapted therapy. Infants with dilating reflux have a higher risk of renal scarring than those without dilatation of the renal pelvis. Bladder dysfunction or dysfunctional elimination syndrome represents a well-known but previously neglected risk factor in combination with VUR and should be treated prior to any surgical intervention as far as is possible.Certainly not every patient with VUR needs therapy. The current treatment strategies take into account age and gender, the presence of dysplastic or pyelonephritic renal scars, the clinical symptoms, bladder dysfunction and frequency and severity of recurrent UTI as criteria for the therapy decision. The use of an antibacterial prophylaxis as well as the duration is controversially discussed. Endoscopic therapy can be a good alternative to antibacterial prophylaxis or a surveillance strategy in patients with low grade VUR. In patients with dilating VUR and given indications for surgery, endoscopic treatment can be offered. However, parents should be completely informed about the significantly lower success rate of endoscopic therapy compared to open surgical procedures. The open surgical techniques guarantee the highest success rates and should be used in patients with a dilating VUR and high risk of renal damage.""","""['R Stein', 'C Ziesel', 'P Rubenwolf', 'R Beetz']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Urologe A""","""['EAU guidelines on vesicoureteral reflux in children.', 'The Swedish infant high-grade reflux trial: Study presentation and vesicoureteral reflux outcome.', 'Factors affecting the success of endoscopic treatment of vesicoureteral reflux and comparison of two dextranomer based bulking agents: does bulking substance matter?', 'Contemporary Management of Vesicoureteral Reflux.', 'Additional VCUG-related parameters for predicting the success of endoscopic injection in children with primary vesicoureteral reflux.']"""

From a risk-communication perspective, such measures are suboptimal for several reasons; their interpretation is not transparent for non-specialists, competing causes of death are ignored and the estimates are unsuitable to predict the outcome of newly diagnosed patients. In this paper, we discuss the relative merits of recently developed alternatives to traditionally reported measures of cancer patient survival.  Methods:   In a relative survival framework, using a period approach, we estimated probabilities of death in the presence of competing risks. To illustrate the methods, we present estimates of survival among 23,353 initially untreated, or hormonally treated men with intermediate- or high-risk localized prostate cancer using Swedish population-based data.  Results:   Among all groups of newly diagnosed patients, the probability of dying from prostate cancer, accounting for competing risks, was lower compared to the corresponding estimates where competing risks were ignored. Accounting for competing deaths was particularly important for patients aged more than 70 years at diagnosis in order to avoid overestimating the risk of dying from prostate cancer.  Conclusions:   We argue that period estimates of survival, accounting for competing risks, provide the tools to communicate the actual risk that cancer patients, diagnosed today, face to die from their disease. Such measures should offer a more useful basis for risk communication between patients and clinicians and we advocate their use as means to answer prognostic questions.""","""['Sandra Eloranta', 'Jan Adolfsson', 'Paul C Lambert', 'Pär Stattin', 'Olof Akre', 'Therese M-L Andersson', 'Paul W Dickman']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Cancer Causes Control""","""['Providing clinicians and patients with actual prognosis: cancer in the context of competing causes of death.', 'Probabilities of dying from cancer and other causes in French cancer patients based on an unbiased estimator of net survival: a study of five common cancers.', 'Competing risk analysis after radical prostatectomy for clinically nonmetastatic prostate adenocarcinoma according to clinical Gleason score and patient age.', 'Global update on defining and treating high-risk localized prostate cancer with leuprorelin: a USA perspective--identifying men at diagnosis who are at high risk of prostate cancer death after surgery or radiation therapy.', 'Natural course of localized prostate cancer. a personal view with a review of published papers.', 'Estimating causal effects in the presence of competing events using regression standardisation with the Stata command standsurv.', 'Reference-Adjusted Loss in Life Expectancy for Population-Based Cancer Patient Survival Comparisons-with an Application to Colon Cancer in Sweden.', 'Socio-economic inequalities in cancer survival: how do they translate into Number of Life-Years Lost?', 'Cancer-specific survival by stage of bladder cancer and factors collected by Mallorca Cancer Registry associated to survival.', 'Net survival differences of breast cancer between stages at diagnosis and age groups in the east coast region of West Malaysia: a retrospective cohort study.']"""

Patients and methods:   Between 2000 and 2011, 896 consecutive patients underwent RP and ePLND at two tertiary referral centers for clinically localized prostate cancer (PCa). Uni- and multivariable logistic regression models predicting the presence of LNI at ePLND were built in. Covariates consisted of preoperative PSA, clinical stage, primary and secondary biopsy Gleason grade with or without percentage of positive cores. Patients' data were entered into a logistic model formula derived from the original publication of Briganti. The nomogram was assessed by comparing its predicted probability of LNI with the actual presence of LNI. The area under the curve was used to quantify its predictive accuracy.  Results:   Mean preoperative PSA, clinical and pathological stage, primary and secondary biopsy and pathological Gleason grade, such as mean number of total cores, positive cores and percentage of positive cores differed significantly between LNI-positive and LNI-negative patients (all p < 0.001 except for number of total cores, p = 0.019). The mean number of lymph nodes removed was 14.8, and LNI was found in 101 patients (11.8%). In the univariate analysis the percentage of positive cores was the most accurate predictor of LNI (72%), followed by PSA (69%), primary biopsy Gleason grade (64%), clinical stage (60%), and secondary biopsy Gleason grade (59%). The predictions of the nomogram were virtually perfect when the predicted probability was ≤20%. We tested the performance characteristics of various Briganti nomogram-derived cut-offs (1-14%) for discriminating between patients with and without LNI. In our population, 41.6% of patients were classified below the 5% cut-off proposed in the original Briganti et al. report. In the multivariate analysis these variables remained statistically significant predictors for the presence of lymph node metastases. The predictive accuracy of the full model reached 79%.

This spectroscopic technique can be used as an effective approach to detect cancer in tissue. The alterations of the measured S3 spectra between cancerous and normal tissues were observed in human breast and prostate samples. In order to obtain the optimal Stokes shift interval, Δλi, for the purpose of breast/prostate cancer detection using S3, the S3 spectra of a mixed aqueous solution of tryptophan, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, and flavin were measured with different Δλi values.

Augmentation of costimulatory signal due to the interaction of DCs and T cells may amplify, sustain and drive diversity of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and consequently enhance the antitumor response. 4-1BBL/4-1BB is such a pair of costimulatory ligand and receptor, playing an important role in the co-stimulation of CTLs. Previously, we demonstrated that DCs transduced with recombinant adenovirus encoding truncated PSMA (tPSMA) and m4-1BBL could induce prostate cancer regression in mouse models. In the present study, we further explored the adjuvant role of 4-1BBL in modulating CTLs activation induced by tPSMA gene-pulsed DCs. The apoptosis and cytotoxicity against tPSMA expressing RM-1 cells of CTLs were determined. Results showed that tPSMA gene-pulsed DCs effectively induced T lymphocyte activation and cytotoxicity, which was enhanced by upregulated expression of 4-1BBL, displaying better cell viability, lower CTLs apoptosis, higher expression anti-apoptotic protein of Bcl-xL and phosphorylation of P38, enhanced NF-κB activation, as well as more IFN-γ production. These results demonstrated that 4-1BBL may play a significant role in the co-stimulation pathway for Ag-presenting DCs-mediated CTLs activity, which might be a beneficial adjuvant factor for DCs-based cancer immunotherapy.""","""['Kuang Youlin', 'Zhang Li', 'Gou Xin', 'Xiao Mingchao', 'Liu Xiuheng', 'Weng Xiaodong']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Hum Vaccin Immunother""","""['Anti-prostate cancer effects of CTL cell induction in vitro by recombinant adenovirus mediated PSMA/4-1BBL dendritic cells: an immunotherapy study.', 'Anti-tumor immune response induced by dendritic cells transduced with truncated PSMA IRES 4-1BBL recombinant adenoviruses.', 'Construction of a recombinant adenovirus co-expressing truncated human prostate-specific membrane antigen and mouse 4-1BBL genes and its effect on dendritic cells.', 'Antitumor immune response induced by DNA vaccine encoding human prostate-specific membrane antigen and mouse 4-1BBL.', 'SA-4-1BBL as a novel adjuvant for the development of therapeutic cancer vaccines.', 'Boosting Antitumor Response by Costimulatory Strategies Driven to 4-1BB and OX40 T-cell Receptors.', 'Stimulation of murine cell-mediated immunity by dietary administration of a cell preparation of Enterococcus faecalis strain KH-2 and its possible activity against tumour development in mice.', 'The therapeutic and diagnostic potential of the prostate specific membrane antigen/glutamate carboxypeptidase II (PSMA/GCPII) in cancer and neurological disease.', 'Targeting of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily for cancer immunotherapy.']"""

Patients and methods:   We assessed clinical trial participation patterns according to important SES (income, education) and demographic factors in a large sample of patients surveyed via an Internet-based treatment decision tool. Logistic regression, conditioning on type of cancer, was used. Attitudes toward clinical trials were assessed using prespecified items about treatment, treatment tolerability, convenience, and cost.  Results:   From 2007 to 2011, 5,499 patients were successfully surveyed. Forty percent discussed clinical trials with their physician, 45% of discussions led to physician offers of clinical trial participation, and 51% of offers led to clinical trial participation. The overall clinical trial participation rate was 9%. In univariate models, older patients (P = .002) and patients with lower income (P = .001) and education (P = .02) were less likely to participate in clinical trials. In a multivariable model, income remained a statistically significant predictor of clinical trial participation (odds ratio, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.57 to 0.94; P = .01). Even in patients age ≥ 65 years, who have universal access to Medicare, lower income predicted lower trial participation. Cost concerns were much more evident among lower-income patients (P < .001).  Conclusion:   Lower-income patients were less likely to participate in clinical trials, even when considering age group. A better understanding of why income is a barrier may help identify ways to make clinical trials better available to all patients and would increase the generalizability of clinical trial results across all income levels.""","""['Joseph M Unger', 'Dawn L Hershman', 'Kathy S Albain', 'Carol M Moinpour', 'Judith A Petersen', 'Kenda Burg', 'John J Crowley']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Clin Oncol""","""['Discussions about clinical trials among patients with newly diagnosed lung and colorectal cancer.', 'Association of Patient Comorbid Conditions With Cancer Clinical Trial Participation.', 'Disparities and trends in the participation of minorities, women, and the elderly in breast, colorectal, lung, and prostate cancer clinical trials.', 'Barriers to the participation of African-American patients with cancer in clinical trials: a pilot study.', 'Involving South Asian patients in clinical trials.', 'Unmet needs and wish for support of family caregivers of primary brain tumor patients.', 'Investigating potential disparities in clinical trial eligibility and enrollment at an NCI-designated comprehensive cancer center.', 'Impact of socioeconomics and race on clinical follow-up and trial enrollment and adherence in cerebral cavernous malformation.', 'Real-world Outcomes Associated With Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibitor Monotherapy Maintenance in Patients With Primary Advanced Ovarian Cancer.', 'Understanding potential participation barriers to improve trial design and outcomes: clinical trial simulation in palmoplantar pustulosis as a case study.']"""

Although treatment modalities are available, these do not confer long-term benefit and are accompanied by substantial side effects. Adoptive immunotherapy represents an attractive alternative to conventional treatments as a means to control tumor growth.  Methods:   To selectively target the tumor-expressed form of Muc1 we constructed a retroviral vector encoding a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) directed against the aberrantly-expressed extracellular portion of Muc1 called the 'variable number of tandem repeats'.  Results:   We now demonstrate that T cells can be genetically engineered to express a CAR targeting the tumor-associated antigen Muc1. CAR-Muc1 T cells were able to selectively kill Muc1-expressing human prostate cancer cells. However, we noted that heterogeneous expression of the Muc1 antigen on tumor cells facilitated immune escape and the outgrowth of target-antigen loss variants of the tumor. Given the importance of androgen ablation therapy in the management of metastatic prostate cancer, we therefore also tested the value of combining conventional (anti-androgen) and experimental (CAR-Muc1 T cells) approaches. We show that CAR-Muc1 T cells were not adversely impacted by anti-androgen therapy and subsequently demonstrate the feasibility of combining the approaches to produce additive anti-tumor effects in vitro.  Conclusions:   Adoptive transfer of CAR-Muc1 T cells alone or in combination with other luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogs or antagonists should be tested in human clinical trials.""","""['C Sanchez', 'R Chan', 'P Bajgain', 'S Rambally', 'G Palapattu', 'M Mims', 'C M Rooney', 'A M Leen', 'M K Brenner', 'J F Vera']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['Phase 1 clinical trial demonstrated that MUC1 positive metastatic seminal vesicle cancer can be effectively eradicated by modified Anti-MUC1 chimeric antigen receptor transduced T cells.', 'Anti-mucin 1 chimeric antigen receptor T cells for adoptive T cell therapy of cholangiocarcinoma.', 'CAR T Cells Targeting the Tumor MUC1 Glycoprotein Reduce Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Growth.', 'Chimeric Antigen Receptor-Engineered T Cell Therapy for the Management of Patients with Metastatic Prostate Cancer: A Comprehensive Review.', 'Tecemotide: an antigen-specific cancer immunotherapy.', 'Combination Immunotherapy in Prostate Cancer.', 'Christmas Tree-Shaped Microneedles as FOLFIRINOX Spatiotemporal Delivery System for Pancreatic Cancer Treatment.', ""Tumor buster - where will the CAR-T cell therapy 'missile' go?"", 'The Cellular and Molecular Immunotherapy in Prostate Cancer.', 'Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-Cell Therapy in Metastatic Castrate-Resistant Prostate Cancer.']"""

Consequently, among many men diagnosed with CaP, there has been a recent trend to resort to active surveillance (wait and watch) if diagnosed with a lower Gleason score on biopsy, as opposed to seeking immediate treatment. Some researchers have recently identified imaging markers for low and high grade CaP on multi-parametric (MP) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging (such as T2 weighted MR imaging (T2w MRI) and MR spectroscopy (MRS)). In this paper, we present a novel computerized decision support system (DSS), called Semi Supervised Multi Kernel Graph Embedding (SeSMiK-GE), that quantitatively combines structural, and metabolic imaging data for distinguishing (a) benign versus cancerous, and (b) high- versus low-Gleason grade CaP regions from in vivo MP-MRI. A total of 29 1.5Tesla endorectal pre-operative in vivo MP MRI (T2w MRI, MRS) studies from patients undergoing radical prostatectomy were considered in this study. Ground truth for evaluation of the SeSMiK-GE classifier was obtained via annotation of disease extent on the pre-operative imaging by visually correlating the MRI to the ex vivo whole mount histologic specimens. The SeSMiK-GE framework comprises of three main modules: (1) multi-kernel learning, (2) semi-supervised learning, and (3) dimensionality reduction, which are leveraged for the construction of an integrated low dimensional representation of the different imaging and non-imaging MRI protocols. Hierarchical classifiers for diagnosis and Gleason grading of CaP are then constructed within this unified low dimensional representation. Step 1 of the hierarchical classifier employs a random forest classifier in conjunction with the SeSMiK-GE based data representation and a probabilistic pairwise Markov Random Field algorithm (which allows for imposition of local spatial constraints) to yield a voxel based classification of CaP presence. The CaP region of interest identified in Step 1 is then subsequently classified as either high or low Gleason grade CaP in Step 2. Comparing SeSMiK-GE with unimodal T2w MRI, MRS classifiers and a commonly used feature concatenation (COD) strategy, yielded areas (AUC) under the receiver operative curve (ROC) of (a) 0.89±0.09 (SeSMiK), 0.54±0.18 (T2w MRI), 0.61±0.20 (MRS), and 0.64±0.23 (COD) for distinguishing benign from CaP regions, and (b) 0.84±0.07 (SeSMiK),0.54±0.13 (MRI), 0.59±0.19 (MRS), and 0.62±0.18 (COD) for distinguishing high and low grade CaP using a leave one out cross-validation strategy, all evaluations being performed on a per voxel basis. Our results suggest that following further rigorous validation, SeSMiK-GE could be developed into a powerful diagnostic and prognostic tool for detection and grading of CaP in vivo and in helping to determine the appropriate treatment option. Identifying low grade disease in vivo might allow CaP patients to opt for active surveillance rather than immediately opt for aggressive therapy such as radical prostatectomy.""","""['Pallavi Tiwari', 'John Kurhanewicz', 'Anant Madabhushi']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Med Image Anal""","""['Semi supervised multi kernel (SeSMiK) graph embedding: identifying aggressive prostate cancer via magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy.', 'Multimodal wavelet embedding representation for data combination (MaWERiC): integrating magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy for prostate cancer detection.', 'Enhanced Multi-Protocol Analysis via Intelligent Supervised Embedding (EMPrAvISE): Detecting Prostate Cancer on Multi-Parametric MRI.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'The role of magnetic resonance imaging in the diagnosis and management of prostate cancer.', 'The role of radiomics in prostate cancer radiotherapy.', 'Detection of Dominant Intra-prostatic Lesions in Patients With Prostate Cancer Using an Artificial Neural Network and MR Multi-modal Radiomics Analysis.', 'Repeatability of radiomics and machine learning for DWI: Short-term repeatability study of 112 patients with prostate cancer.', 'Semi-automatic classification of prostate cancer on multi-parametric MR imaging using a multi-channel 3D convolutional neural network.', 'Patch-Based Label Fusion for Automatic Multi-Atlas-Based Prostate Segmentation in MR Images.']"""

Methods:   Eligible patients had advanced prostate cancer (metastasis, a prostate-specific-antigen test result of more than 10·0 ng/mL, and WHO performance status score of 0-2), had received no chemotherapy (except with estramustine), had undergone surgical or chemical castration, and had been referred to a treatment centre in Finland, Ireland, or Sweden. Enrolment and treatment were done between March 1, 2004, and May 31, 2009. Randomisation was done centrally and stratified by centre and WHO performance status score of 0-1 vs 2. Patients were assigned 75 mg/m(2) docetaxel intravenously on day 1 of a 3-week cycle, or 50 mg/m(2) docetaxel intravenously on days 1 and 15 of a 4-week cycle. 10 mg oral prednisolone was administered daily to all patients. The primary endpoint was time to treatment failure (TTTF). We assessed data in the per-protocol population. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00255606.  Findings:   177 patients were randomly assigned to the 2-weekly docetaxel group and 184 to the 3-weekly group. 170 patients in the 2-weekly group and 176 in the 3-weekly group were included in the analysis.

AND WHAT DOES THE STUDY ADD?: Hypogonadism affects an estimated 2-4 million men in the USA, but only 5% receive treatment. Testosterone replacement therapy reduces the effects of testosterone deficiency on sexual function, mood and energy in hypogonadal patients. Long-term hypogonadism management requires testosterone treatment to restore serum concentrations of testosterone and its active metabolites, within physiological ranges; a testosterone preparation that achieves physiological plasma concentrations without supra-physiological escape is a preferred option. A previous 1-year study European clinical study showed the efficacy and safety of a transdermal testosterone patch (Testopatch(®) ). The present study shows the long-term (6-year) safety and efficacy of Testopatch in patients with primary or secondary hypogonadism. We show that, over the long-term, Testopatch was associated with no relevant changes in PSA concentration and PSA velocity, or any significant prostate risks (there were no cases of prostate cancer).  Objective:   To assess the change in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) concentrations in patients with primary or secondary hypogonadism, receiving transdermal testosterone.  Patients and methods:   This was an interventional, 6-year study, conducted in Urology and Endocrinology centres in Belgium, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Spain. Participants were primary (48%) or secondary (52%) hypogonadal patients who received two 60 cm(2) testosterone patches (Testopatch(®) ), delivering 4.8 mg of testosterone per day, applied every 2 days. During treatment, total testosterone (TT), dihydrotestosterone, oestradiol and, PSA concentrations were measured in a centralised laboratory every 3 months during the first year, and every 6 months thereafter.  Results:   In all, 200 patients [mean (sd) age 41.0 (12.5) years, body weight 82.5 (13.7) kg, height 177.2 (9.3) cm, body mass index 26.2 (3.4) kg/m(2) ] were treated with transdermal testosterone patches. In all, 161 patients completed the 1-year study and 115 entered into a 5-year study extension; 51 patients completed the sixth year of the study. The mean baseline concentrations of TT and PSA were 1.4 ng/mL and 0.47 ng/mL, respectively; TT serum concentrations >3 ng/mL were achieved in 85% of patients and fluctuated between 4.4 and 6.0 ng/mL. At each successive 6-month time point, mean the PSA values were 0.60, 0.67, 0.76, 0.70, 0.61, 0.68, 0.64, 0.71, 0.75, 0.74, 1.01, 0.78, 0.80 ng/mL, respectively. The mean PSA velocity was negligible (0.00-0.03 ng/mL/year) from 30 months to the end of the trial, except for a value of 0.08 at 60 months. Seven patients had a PSA concentration of >4 ng/mL due to a sharp PSA increase. Six of these patients had prostatitis and PSA concentrations returned to previous levels with appropriate treatment. No prostate cancer was reported during the trial.  Conclusion:   These data support a strong safety profile for Testopatch, even at the highest registered dosage.""","""['Jean-Pierre Raynaud', 'Jean Gardette', 'Jacques Rollet', 'Jean-Jacques Legros']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Re: Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) concentrations in hypogonadal men during 6 years of transdermal testosterone treatment.', 'Correlation between simultaneous PSA and serum testosterone concentrations among eugonadal, untreated hypogonadal and hypogonadal men receiving testosterone replacement therapy.', 'Prostate-specific antigen changes and prostate cancer in hypogonadal men treated with testosterone replacement therapy.', 'Changes in prostate specific antigen in hypogonadal men after 12 months of testosterone replacement therapy: support for the prostate saturation theory.', 'The current status of therapy for symptomatic late-onset hypogonadism with transdermal testosterone gel.', 'The long-term efficacy and safety of a testosterone mucoadhesive buccal tablet in testosterone-deficient men.', 'Is Oral Testosterone the New Frontier of Testosterone Replacement Therapy?', 'A systematic review on the latest developments in testosterone therapy: Innovations, advances, and paradigm shifts.', 'Association Between Serum Testosterone and Serum PSA Among Men With and Without Partial Androgen Deficiency.', 'Association between Serum Testosterone and PSA Levels in Middle-Aged Healthy Men from the General Population.', 'Efficacy and safety of testosterone replacement therapy in men with hypogonadism: A meta-analysis study of placebo-controlled trials.']"""

Although the actions of androgens have been studied extensively, the mechanisms underlying oestrogen signalling in prostate cancer are not fully understood. In the present study, we analyzed the effect of androgens and oestrogens on the expression of anterior gradient 2 (AGR2) and anterior gradient 3 (AGR3), comprising two highly-related genes encoding secretory proteins that are expressed in prostate cancer and one of which (AGR2) has been associated with tumour metastasis. Quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR and western blot analysis showed androgen induction of AGR2 and AGR3 in three androgen receptor positive cell lines, starting at concentrations of 0.1 nm. Both AGR genes were also transcriptionally activated by ≥ 5 nM oestradiol but not by isotype selective or nonselective oestrogen receptor agonists in DUCaP cells that harbour a high-level of wild-type androgen receptor. A functional androgen receptor but not oestrogen receptor turned out to be required for both androgen and oestrogen regulation. This pattern of androgen and oestrogen regulation was confirmed in VCaP cells and was also observed for FKBP5, a well-characterized androgen-regulated gene. Genome-wide chromatin-immunoprecipitation studies coupled with deep sequencing identified androgen receptor binding sites localized in the distal promoter and intron regions of the AGR2 and AGR3 genes, respectively. The androgen responsiveness of these enhancers was verified by luciferase reporter gene assays and site-directed mutagenesis analysis. Androgen treatment also induced p300 and RNA Pol II recruitment to androgen receptor enhancers of AGR2 and initiated local chromatin remodelling and the formation of RNA Pol II-containing androgen receptor transcription complexes.""","""['Huajie Bu', 'Michal R Schweiger', 'Thomas Manke', 'Andrea Wunderlich', 'Bernd Timmermann', 'Martin Kerick', 'Lorenza Pasqualini', 'Erald Shehu', 'Christian Fuchsberger', 'Andrew C B Cato', 'Helmut Klocker']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""FEBS J""","""['Prohibitin and the SWI/SNF ATPase subunit BRG1 are required for effective androgen antagonist-mediated transcriptional repression of androgen receptor-regulated genes.', 'Anterior Gradient-3: a novel biomarker for ovarian cancer that mediates cisplatin resistance in xenograft models.', 'A competitive inhibitor that reduces recruitment of androgen receptor to androgen-responsive genes.', 'Androgen receptor-driven chromatin looping in prostate cancer.', 'In touch with your feminine side: how oestrogen metabolism impacts prostate cancer.', 'Over-expression of Anterior Gradient 3 Is Associated With Tumor Progression and Poor Survival in Gastric Cancer.', 'AGR2 expression as a predictive biomarker for therapy response in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.', 'Comparison of anti-cancer effects of novel protein disulphide isomerase (PDI) inhibitors in breast cancer cells characterized by high and low PDIA17 expression.', 'From development to cancer - an ever-increasing role of AGR2.', 'The Anterior GRadient (AGR) family proteins in epithelial ovarian cancer.']"""

Stress management interventions have proven to be effective; however, they are mostly performed in group settings and it is commonly breast cancer patients who are studied. We hereby present the design of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluating the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of an individual stress-management intervention with a stepped-care approach in several cancer diagnoses.  Method:   Patients (≥ 18 years) with a recent diagnosis of breast cancer, colorectal cancer, lymphoma, prostate cancer or testicle cancer and scheduled for adjuvant/curative oncology treatment, will consecutively be included in the study. In this prospective longitudinal intervention study with a stepped-care approach, patients will be randomized to control, treatment as usual, or an individual stress-management intervention in two steps. The first step is a low-intensity stress-management intervention, given to all patients randomized to intervention. Patients who continue to report stress symptoms after the first step will thereafter be given more intensive treatment at the second step of the programme. In the intervention patients will also be motivated to be physically active. Avoidance and intrusion are the primary outcomes. According to the power analyses, 300 patients are planned to be included in the study and will be followed for two years. Other outcomes are physical activity level, sleep duration and quality recorded objectively, and anxiety, depression, quality of life, fatigue, stress in daily living, and patient satisfaction assessed using valid and standardized psychometric tested questionnaires. Utilization of hospital services will be derived from the computerized patient administration systems used by the hospital. The cost-effectiveness of the intervention will be evaluated through a cost-utility analysis.  Discussion:   This RCT will provide empirical evidence of whether an individually administered stress-management programme in two steps can decrease stress as well as maintain or enhance patients' physical activity level, quality of life and psychological well-being. Further, this RCT, with a stepped-care approach, will provide knowledge regarding the cost-effectiveness of an individually administered stress-management programme whose aim is to help and support individual patients at the right level of care.

However, the application of Herceptin in prostate cancer is still controversial. Our previous results have indicated the relevance of Her2 in the transition of the androgen requirement in prostate cancer cells. In this study, the effects of radioimmunotherapy against Her2 in prostate cancer were investigated.  Materials and methods:   DU145, an androgen receptor-negative prostate cancer cell line, was used in vitro and in vivo to evaluate the effects of Herceptin labeled with a beta emitter, Rhenium-188 (Re-188). Its effects on cell growth, extent of apoptosis, the bio-distribution of Re-188 labeled Herceptin (Re-H), and protein levels were determined.  Results:   Treatments with Re-188 and Re-H reduced the proliferation of DU145 cells in dose- and time-dependent manners compared to the Herceptin-treated group. Growth inhibition and apoptosis were induced after Re-H treatment; growth inhibition was more distinct in cells with high Her2/p-Her2 levels. Our in vivo xenograft studies revealed that Re-H treatment significantly retarded tumor growth and altered the levels of apoptosis-related proteins. The bio-distribution of Re-H in mice demonstrated a tissue-specific pattern. Importantly, the levels of p35 protein, which is related to cancer cell survival and invasion, dramatically decreased after Re-H treatment.  Conclusions:   Our data demonstrate that Re-188-labeled Herceptin effectively inhibited the growth of DU145 cells compared to the Herceptin- and Re-188-treated cohorts. This implies that targeting Her2 by both radio- and immuno- therapy might be a potential strategy for treating patients with androgen-independent prostate cancer.""","""['Hsin-Yi Wang', 'Wan-Yu Lin', 'Mei-Chih Chen', 'Teh Lin', 'Chih-Hao Chao', 'Fu-Ning Hsu', 'Eugene Lin', 'Chih-Yang Huang', 'Tsai-Yueh Luo', 'Ho Lin']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Biol""","""['188Re-HYNIC-trastuzumab enhances the effect of apoptosis induced by trastuzumab in HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cells.', 'In vivo examination of (188)Re(I)-tricarbonyl-labeled trastuzumab to target HER2-overexpressing breast cancer.', 'Evaluating the potential of 188Re-SOCTA-trastuzumab as a new radioimmunoagent for breast cancer treatment.', 'Monoclonal Antibodies Radiolabeling with Rhenium-188 for Radioimmunotherapy.', 'Direct radiolabeling of monoclonal antibodies with rhenium-188 for radioimmunotherapy of solid tumors--a review of radiolabeling characteristics, quality control and in vitro stability studies.', 'Future Aspects of CDK5 in Prostate Cancer: From Pathogenesis to Therapeutic Implications.', 'Rhenium-188 Labeled Radiopharmaceuticals: Current Clinical Applications in Oncology and Promising Perspectives.', 'Biodistribution, pharmacokinetics and radioimmunotherapy of 188Re-cetuximab in NCI-H292 human lung tumor-bearing nude mice.', 'Nanoparticles as Theranostic Vehicles in Experimental and Clinical Applications-Focus on Prostate and Breast Cancer.', 'Investigation of SP94 Peptide as a Specific Probe for Hepatocellular Carcinoma Imaging and Therapy.']"""

Results:   Biochemical progression-free survival after salvage radiotherapy at 2, 5 and 7 years was 51.0%, 42.2% and 42.2%, respectively. Significant parameters predicting biochemical progression after salvage radiotherapy by Cox regression analysis were prostatectomy Gleason score sum ≥ 8 (hazard ratio 0.08; 95% confidence interval 0.03-0.22; P=0.001), prostate-specific antigen nadir after radical prostatectomy ≥ 0.04 ng/mL (hazard ratio 0.30; 95% confidence interval 0.13-0.69; P=0.005) and negative surgical margin (hazard ratio 0.28; 95% confidence interval 0.12-0.70; P=0.006).

However, etiology of prostate cancer is still unknown. Individual risk and incidence of prostate cancer may result from the interaction of genetic susceptibility with exposure to environmental factors such as infectious agents, tobacco, occupational exposure, dietary carcinogens, and/or hormonal imbalances leading to injury of the prostate and to the development of chronic inflammation. About 30% of all human cancers are caused by tobacco smoking and inhaled pollutants. Inflammation is now regarded as an important hallmark of cancer. The present study has been aimed to explore the pro-inflammatory levels in prostate carcinoma patients by examining the serum levels of novel cytokine interleukin-18 (IL-18) expression in tobacco exposed population. A total of 578 (n = 284 biopsy proven prostate cancer patients, n = 294 controls with and without tobacco exposed population) were recruited. Serum IL-18 (Interleukin-18) level was done by ELISA. The IL-18 levels between cancer patients and controls within same mode tobacco exposure as tobacco smoking (overall) showed significant difference (P < 0.0001) and further we compared within stratified group, it significantly differ (P < 0.0001) in bidi and cigarette smoking than control non users. Furthermore, IL-18 levels in tobacco chewers (overall) with gutkha and khaini chewers showed significant difference (P < 0.01) than controls non users. Moreover, the IL-18 levels between cancer patients and controls with in of combined mode chewers smokers and alcohol (CSA), smokers with alcohol showed significant difference (P < 0.01) than controls. The IL-18 levels also differed significantly (P < 0.05) with smokers and chewers in higher stages of III and IV, and showed non significant with in lower stages. Tobacco exposure enhance the inflammation in prostate carcinoma patients in stratified group as it have been represented as a risk factors in various cancers, but this study provide further its role that seems to influence inflammation especially in prostate carcinoma.""","""['Shailendra Dwivedi', 'Apul Goel', 'Anil Mandhani', 'Sanjay Khattri', 'Kamlesh Kumar Pant']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Toxicol Int""","""['Tobacco exposure by various modes may alter proinflammatory (IL-12) and anti-inflammatory (IL-10) levels and affects the survival of prostate carcinoma patients: an explorative study in North Indian population.', 'Pro-(IL-18) and Anti-(IL-10) Inflammatory Promoter Genetic Variants (Intrinsic Factors) with Tobacco Exposure (Extrinsic Factors) May Influence Susceptibility and Severity of Prostate Carcinoma: A Prospective Study.', 'Estimation of major immunoglobulins in smokers and gutkha chewers.', 'Potential inhibitors of tobacco carcinogenesis.', 'Tobacco-specific N-nitrosamines and Areca-derived N-nitrosamines: chemistry, biochemistry, carcinogenicity, and relevance to humans.', 'Relationship between cigarette use and prostate cancer risk: what do we know and what should we do?', 'Lifestyle habits to prevent the development of benign prostatic hyperplasia: Analysis of Japanese nationwide datasets.', 'Impact of cigarette smoke and aerobic physical training on histological and molecular markers of prostate health in rats.', 'Effect of Severity of Opiate Use on Cardiometabolic Profile of Chronic Opiate Dependents of Western Rajasthan.', 'Association between IL-18 -607 C/A Polymorphism and the Risk of Prostate Cancer: A Meta-Analysis of Case-Control Studies.']"""

In the present study, the relative abundance of a collection of lncRNAs in tissue or saliva samples from OSCC patients was investigated. It was shown that subsets of lncRNAs are expressed across non‑tumor, tumor and metastatic tissue samples. Some detected lncRNAs were shown to be aberrantly expressed in cases of oral cancer and metastasis.

Ureteral obstruction is a complication of advanced prostate cancer, usually relieved with placement of retrograde ureteral stent (RUS) or percutaneous nephrostomy (PCN) to palliate symptoms associated with obstructive uropathy and/or renal failure. We investigated predictors of receipt of RUS and PCN and their association with survival for older advanced prostate cancer patients.  Methods:   Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare database, we identified patients aged 65 or older with stage IV (n = 10,848) or recurrent (n = 7,872) prostate cancer. We used multivariable analysis to compare those with ureteral obstruction treated with RUS or PCN to those not treated and to analyze the association between RUS, PCN, and survival.  Results:   Sixteen percent (n = 2,958) of the sample developed ureteral obstruction. Compared to no treatment, African Americans were more likely to undergo placement of PCN [odds ratio 1.48, 95 % confidence intervals (CI) 1.03-2.13] than Whites, but equally likely to receive a stent. Subjects of >80 years were less likely to undergo RUS (ages 80-84, 0.41, 95 % CI 0.27-0.63; ages ≥85, 0.30, 95 % CI 0.16-0.54) compared to patients 65-69 years. Subjects who received a PCN were 55 % more likely to die than those who were untreated. There was no difference in survival among those receiving RUS vs untreated. Nine percent of subjects received RUS or PCN within 30 days of dying.

Moreover, laparoscopic total mesorectal excision (TME) may be associated with increased rates of male sexual dysfunction compared to conventional open TME. Robotic surgery could potentially obtain better results than laparoscopy. The aim of this study was to compare the clinical and functional outcomes of robotic and laparoscopic surgery in a single-center experience.  Methods:   This study was based on 100 patients who underwent minimally invasive anterior rectal resection with TME. Fifty consecutive robotic rectal anterior resections with TME (R-TME) were compared to the first 50 consecutive laparoscopic rectal resections with TME (L-TME).  Results:   Median operative time was 270 min in R-TME and 275 min in L-TME. No conversions occurred in the R-TME group whereas six conversions occurred in the L-TME group. The mean number of harvested lymph nodes was 16.5 ± 7.1 for R-TME and 13.8 ± 6.7 for L-TME. The circumferential margin (CRM) was <2 mm in six L-TME patients, whereas no one in R-TME group had a CRM <2 mm. The International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) scores were significantly increased 1 month after surgery in both the L-TME and R-TME groups, but they normalized 1 year after surgery.

Comprehensive expression analysis of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) and microarray data and serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) were conducted to screen in silico for candidate prostate cancer‑associated genes. Reverse transcription (RT)-PCR was performed to validate prostate cancer specificity. Prostate cancer‑associated gene 1 (PCAG1) was identified. The expression of PCAG1 mRNA and protein was evaluated in common human normal tissues, common malignant tumors, prostate adenocarcinoma and paired adjacent normal prostate tissues. An immunofluorescence assay was conducted to determine the subcellular location of PCAG1. PCAG1 mRNA was absent in the 15 pooled normal tissues (including normal prostate tissue) but registered at low levels in the spleen tissue (+). By contrast, PCAG1 mRNA was significantly higher than in the adjacent normal tissues in each of the 14 cases of prostate cancer, with ~50% scoring a high degree of expression (+++). Of the 32 types of normal tissues, 29 (including normal prostate tissue) demonstrated negative PCAG1 protein staining while the remaining tissues of the adrenal gland, parathyroid gland and liver expressed low levels. While 18/20 cases of prostate adenocarcinoma showed positive expression results, PCAG1 protein expression in the remaining types of cancer was scarce when present at all; only 41/380 other cancer cases demonstrated positive results at a low level. The most substantial PCAG1-positive expression results were identified by cytoplasmic staining in 36/38 prostate adenocarcinoma cases, with 10 cases showing high expression levels, 20 showing medium levels and 6 showing low levels. In the paired adjacent normal prostate tissues, only 3/38 cases showed low level positive staining, while 35/38 cases were negative. Immunofluorescent staining of the human prostate cancer PC3 cell line showed positive PCAG1 expression results in the mitochondria. The present study demonstrated that while PCAG1 mRNA was highly expressed in prostate cancer tissues, it was almost absent in all common normal tissues and paired adjacent normal prostate tissues. Furthermore, PCAG1 protein was also highly expressed in prostate cancer tissues, while few common normal tissues, other common malignant tumors and paired adjacent normal prostate tissues had even low levels of expression. Clarification of the function and transcriptional mechanism of PCAG1 may aid the elucidation of the mechanisms of carcinogenesis and progression of prostate cancer.

Blood samples were collected from all individuals for DNA isolation, used for subsequent genotyping assays via PCR-RFLP methods. Overall, we did not observe any significant association between this polymorphism and prostate cancer risk. An analysis of the association between the p21 genotypes and smoking was then conducted. Among smokers, CC and CT genotypes were associated with a non‑significant increased risk (OR=1.48; 95% CI, 0.80-2.76 and OR=1.15; 95% CI, 0.27‑4.77, respectively; p>0.05) in comparison to non-smokers with the CC genotype.

No significant association was detected between Gleason score and prostate cancer risk. Based on these results, we concluded that the p21 C70T polymorphism is associated with decreased risk of prostate cancer in Slovak men.

This compound has been shown to possess many pharmacological properties, such as enhancing the body's immune function, and anti-inflammatory, anti-aging and anticancer effects. In the present study, we investigated the apoptotic effects of cordycepin in human prostate carcinoma cells. We found that treatment with cordycepin significantly inhibited cell growth by inducing apoptosis in PC-3 cells. Apoptosis induction of PC-3 cells by cordycepin showed correlation with proteolytic activation of caspase-3 and -9, but not caspase-8, and concomitant degradation of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerases, collapse of the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). In addition, cordycepin treatment resulted in an increase of the Bax/Bcl-2 (or Bcl-xL) ratio, downregulation of inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) family members, Bax conformational changes, and release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria to the cytosol. The cordycepin-induced apoptosis was also associated with the generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, the quenching of ROS generation with antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine conferred significant protection against cordycepin-elicited ROS generation, disruption of the MMP, modulation of Bcl-2 and IAP family proteins, caspase-3 and -9 activation and apoptosis. This indicates that the cellular ROS generation plays a pivotal role in the initiation of cordycepin-triggered apoptotic death. Collectively, our findings suggest that cordycepin is a potent inducer of apoptosis of prostate cancer cells via a mitochondrial-mediated intrinsic pathway and that this agent may be of value in the development of a potential therapeutic candidate for both the prevention and treatment of cancer.""","""['Hye Hyeon Lee', 'Cheol Park', 'Jin-Woo Jeong', 'Min Jeong Kim', 'Min Jeong Seo', 'Byoung Won Kang', 'Jeong Uck Park', 'Gi-Young Kim', 'Byung Tae Choi', 'Yung Hyun Choi', 'Yong Kee Jeong']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Int J Oncol""","""['N,N-dimethyl phytosphingosine induces caspase-8-dependent cytochrome c release and apoptosis through ROS generation in human leukemia cells.', 'A novel synthetic analog of Militarin, MA-1 induces mitochondrial dependent apoptosis by ROS generation in human lung cancer cells.', 'Hexane extracts of garlic cloves induce apoptosis through the generation of reactive oxygen species in Hep3B human hepatocarcinoma cells.', 'Mitochondrial reactive oxygen species in cell death signaling.', 'Cordycepin: a bioactive metabolite with therapeutic potential.', 'Cordycepin Attenuates Testosterone-Induced Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia in Rats via Modulation of AMPK and AKT Activation.', 'A Systematic Review of the Biological Effects of Cordycepin.', 'The Novel Nucleoside Analogue ProTide NUC-7738 Overcomes Cancer Resistance Mechanisms In Vitro and in a First-In-Human Phase I Clinical Trial.', 'Dysregulation of Catalase by a Sulphamoylated Estradiol Analogue Culminates in Antimitotic Activity and Cell Death Induction in Breast Cancer Cell Lines.', 'Anti-Cancer Effect of Cordycepin on FGF9-Induced Testicular Tumorigenesis.']"""

Implant seeds used in this procedure contain a precise amount of radionuclide and are completely sealed. Because these seeds are not manufactured in Japan, they are expensive (6300 yen per seed) and therefore need careful management as a radioisotope. The proper implantation technique requires considerable procedure time, good dosimetric outcomes and simple radioactive isotope management. To evaluate the modified hybrid interactive technique based on these considerations, we assessed 313 patients who underwent hybrid interactive brachytherapy without additional external beam radiotherapy. We evaluated the duration of the procedure, dosimetric factors and the total number of excess seeds. The dosimetric results from computed tomography on Day 30 of follow-up were: 172 Gy (range 130-194 Gy) for pD90, 97.8% (83.5-100%) for pV100, 54.6% (27.5-82.4%) for pV150, 164 Gy (120-220 Gy) for uD90, 194 Gy (126-245 Gy) for uD30, 210 Gy (156-290 Gy) for uD5, 0.02 ml (0-1.2 ml) for rV100 and 0 ml (0-0.2 ml) for rV150. The number of excess seeds was determined by subtracting the number of implanted seeds from the expected number of seeds calculated from previously proposed nomograms.

Therefore, the goal of this study was to assess the association between ADT use and second primary malignancies among men diagnosed with localized prostate cancer.  Methods:   We assessed whether use of ADT (specifically, gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists) was associated with the development of second primary malignancies in a retrospective cohort of 24,038 men ages more than 18 years who were diagnosed with localized prostate cancer between 1998 and 2007, and followed through 2009. We used proportional hazards regression to estimate the risk of developing a second primary cancer among men who were treated with ADT compared with men who were not.  Results:   Men who were treated with ADT were not more likely to develop any second primary malignancy compared with those who were not treated with ADT after adjustment for age, race, date of diagnosis, utilization, clinical stage, Gleason score, and radiation therapy [HR, 1.10; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.98-1.22)]. Radiotherapy, diabetes, and obesity did not modify the association between ADT use and second primary cancer risk.

Methods:   Polyethyleneimine (PEI) was modified by using polyethylene glycol and transferrin to synthesize the non-viral vector Tf-PEG-PEI. NS-specific plasmids pPSMAe/p-shNS-ploy(A) and Tf-PEG-PEI were used to transfect prostate cancer LNCap and PC-3 cells. The changes of cell morphology, proliferation ability and cell cycle were studied after down-regulating the NS gene level.  Results:   Tf-PEG-PEI was successfully modified. After transfection, the PSMA-expressing LNCaP cells became larger and showed more pseudopodia, having a tendency to differentiate. Their cell proliferation ability was reduced, and the detection of cell cycle showed a decrease of S phase and an increase of G(1) phase after knocking down NS gene. These targets were not changed in non-PSMA-expresing PC-3 cells.  Conclusions:   The non-viral vector Tf-PEG-PEI has a high ability to transfer targeted gene into target cells.

Methods:   A total of 165 patients with T1c-T3b prostate cancer received transperineal ultrasound-guided (125)I permanent seed implantation and neo-adjuvant hormonal therapy (NHT). Their median age was 79 years (range: 65 - 88). They were randomized into 2 groups: group A (n = 90, 3-month NHT before (125)I permanent seed implantation for prostate cancer 0 and group B (n = 75, (125)I permanent seed implantation).

Treatment of cancer cells with external stressors such as irradiation can stimulate the over-expression of COX-2 and possibly confer radiation resistance. In this study, we tested if topical diclofenac, which inhibits both COX-1 and COX-2, administration rendered prostate tumor cells sensitize to the effects of radiation.  Methods:   LNCaP-COX-2 and LNCaP-Neo cells were treated with 0 to 1000 μM diclofenac. Next, a clonogenic assay was performed in which cells were subjected to irradiation (0 to 4 Gy) with or without diclofenac. COX-2 expression and other relevant molecules were measured by real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry after irradiation and diclofenac treatment. In addition, we assessed the tumor volumes of xenograft LNCaP-COX-2 cells treated with topical diclofenac with or without radiation therapy (RT).  Results:   LNCaP-COX-2 and LNCaP-Neo cell lines experienced cytotoxic effects of diclofenac in a dose related manner. Clonogenic assays demonstrated that LNCaP-COX-2 cells were significantly more resistant to RT than LNCaP-Neo cells. Furthermore, the addition of diclofenac sensitized LNCaP-COX-2 not but LNCaP-Neo cells to the cytocidal effects of radiation. In LNCaP-COX-2 cells, diclofenac enhanced radiation-induced apoptosis compared with RT alone. This phenomenon might be attributed to enhancement of RT-induced TRAIL expression as demonstrated by real-time PCR analysis. Lastly, tumor volumes of LNCaP-COX-2 cells xenograft treated with diclofenac or RT alone was >4-fold higher than in mice treated with combined diclofenac and radiation (p<0.05).  Conclusions:   These in vitro and in vivo findings suggest that conventional COX inhibitor, diclofenac enhances the effect of RT on prostate cancer cells that express COX-2. Thus, diclofenac may have potential as radiosensitizer for treatment of prostate cancer.""","""['Takeshi Inoue', 'Satoshi Anai', 'Sayuri Onishi', 'Makito Miyake', 'Nobumichi Tanaka', 'Akihide Hirayama', 'Kiyohide Fujimoto', 'Yoshihiko Hirao']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""BMC Urol""","""['Increased expression of cyclooxygenase-2 correlates with resistance to radiation in human prostate adenocarcinoma cells.', 'Targeted radiotherapy potentiates the cytotoxicity of a novel anti-human DR5 monoclonal antibody and the adenovirus encoding soluble TRAIL in prostate cancer.', 'Inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 activity by celecoxib does not lead to radiosensitization of human prostate cancer cells in vitro.', 'Preclinical evaluation of sunitinib, a multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor, as a radiosensitizer for human prostate cancer.', 'COX inhibitors and breast cancer.', 'The effect of valproic acid on intrinsic, extrinsic, and JAK/STAT pathways in neuroblastoma and glioblastoma cell lines.', 'Therapeutic application of PPE2 protein of\u2009Mycobacterium tuberculosis in inhibiting tissue inflammation.', 'Effect of Zebularine in Comparison to Trichostatin A on the Intrinsic and Extrinsic Apoptotic Pathway, Cell Viability, and Apoptosis in Hepatocellular Carcinoma SK-Hep 1, Human Colorectal Cancer SW620, and Human Pancreatic Cancer PaCa-44 Cell Lines.', 'The molecular targets of diclofenac differs from ibuprofen to induce apoptosis and epithelial mesenchymal transition due to alternation on oxidative stress management p53 independently in PC3 prostate cancer cells.', 'Activation of PTGS2/NF-κB signaling pathway enhances radiation resistance of glioma.']"""

For a separate tester set of 15 patients with previously contoured ROIs by three experienced physicians, atlas-assisted contours were compared to manual contours by calculating a volumetric overlap index. In the tester set patients, the average overlap between the manually drawn and atlas-based contours for the prostate, pelvic lymph nodes, and rectum was 60%, 51%, and 64%, respectively. The volume differences were significant in the rectum and pelvic lymph nodes (p = 0.049 and p = 0.016, respectively); this was not true for the prostate. A subset analysis based on physician-specific atlases showed that the average overlap index for the pelvic lymph nodal volume increased from 51% to 60%, while the other ROIs had no significant changes.

We examined these issues in the Swiss National Cohort (SNC).  Methods:   The SNC is a longitudinal study of the entire Swiss population, based on the 1990 (6.8 million persons) and 2000 (7.3 million persons) censuses. Among 1,053,393 deaths recorded 1991-2007 5.4% could not be linked using stringent probabilistic linkage. We included the unlinked deaths using pragmatic linkages and compared mortality rates for selected causes with official mortality rates. We also examined the impact of the 1995 change in cause of death coding from version 8 (with some additional rules) to version 10 of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD), using Poisson regression models with restricted cubic splines. Finally, we compared results from Cox models including and excluding unlinked deaths of the association of education, marital status, and nationality with selected causes of death.  Results:   SNC mortality rates underestimated all cause mortality by 9.6% (range 2.4%-17.9%) in the 85+ population. Underestimation was less pronounced in years nearer the censuses and in the 75-84 age group. After including 99.7% of unlinked deaths, annual all cause SNC mortality rates were reflecting official rates (relative difference between -1.4% and +1.8%). In the 85+ population the rates for prostate and breast cancer dropped, by 16% and 21% respectively, between 1994 and 1995 coincident with the change in cause of death coding policy. For suicide in males almost no change was observed. Hazard ratios were only negligibly affected by including the unlinked deaths. A sudden decrease in breast (21% less, 95% confidence interval: 12%-28%) and prostate (16% less, 95% confidence interval: 7%-23%) cancer mortality rates in the 85+ population coincided with the 1995 change in cause of death coding policy.  Conclusions:   Unlinked deaths bias analyses of absolute mortality rates downwards but have little effect on relative mortality.

Objective:   We investigated the relationship between PFOA exposure and cancer among residents living near the DuPont Teflon-manufacturing plant in Parkersburg, West Virginia (WV).  Methods:   Our analyses included incident cases of 18 cancers diagnosed from 1996 through 2005 in five Ohio (OH) counties and eight WV counties. For analyses of each cancer outcome, controls comprised all other cancers in the study data set except kidney, pancreatic, testicular, and liver cancers, which have been associated with PFOA in animal or human studies. We applied logistic regression models to individual-level data to calculate adjusted odds ratios (AORs) and confidence intervals (CIs). For the combined analysis of OH and WV data, the exposure of interest was resident water district. Within OH, geocoded addresses were integrated with a PFOA exposure model to examine the relationship between cancer odds and categories of estimated PFOA serum.  Results:   Our final data set included 7,869 OH cases and 17,238 WV cases. There was a positive association between kidney cancer and the very high and high serum exposure categories [AOR = 2.0 (95% CI: 1.0, 3.9) n = 9 and 2.0 (95% CI: 1.3, 3.2) n = 22, respectively] and a null association with the other exposure categories compared with the unexposed. The largest AOR was for testicular cancer with the very high exposure category [2.8 (95% CI: 0.8, 9.2) n = 6], but there was an inverse association with the lower exposure groups, and all estimates were imprecise because of small case numbers.

Transformation of epithelial cells to mesenchymal lineage, associated with the loss of E-cadherin, offers significant invasive potential and migration capability. Recently, Special AT-rich binding protein (SATB1) has been linked to tumor progression. SATB1 is a cell-type restricted nuclear protein, which functions as a tissue-specific organizer of DNA sequences during cellular differentiation. Our results demonstrate that SATB1 plays significant role in prostate tumor invasion and migration and its nuclear localization correlates with disease aggressiveness. Clinical specimen analysis showed that SATB1 was predominantly expressed in the nucleus of high-grade tumors compared to low-grade tumor and benign tissue. A progressive increase in the nuclear levels of SATB1 was observed in cancer tissues compared to benign specimens. Similarly, SATB1 protein levels were higher in a number of prostate cancer cells viz. HPV-CA-10, DU145, DUPro, PC-3, PC-3M, LNCaP and C4-2B, compared to non-tumorigenic PZ-HPV-7 cells. Nuclear expression of SATB1 was higher in biologically aggressive subclones of prostate cancer cells with their respective parental cell lines. Furthermore, ectopic SATB1 transfection conferred increased cell motility and invasiveness in immortalized human prostate epithelial PZ-HPV-7 cells which correlated with the loss of E-cadherin expression. Consequently, knockdown of SATB1 in highly aggressive human prostate cancer PC-3M cells inhibited invasiveness and tumor growth in vivo along with increase in E-cadherin protein expression. Our findings demonstrate that SATB1 has ability to promote prostate cancer aggressiveness through epithelial-mesenchymal transition.""","""['Sanjeev Shukla', 'Haripaul Sharma', 'Ata Abbas', 'Gregory T MacLennan', 'Pingfu Fu', 'David Danielpour', 'Sanjay Gupta']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['The Role of SATB1 in Tumour Progression and Metastasis.', 'SATB1 promotes prostate cancer metastasis by the regulation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition.', 'Multiple effects of the special AT-rich binding protein 1 (SATB1) in colon carcinoma.', 'SATB1 is overexpressed in metastatic prostate cancer and promotes prostate cancer cell growth and invasion.', 'The Special AT-rich Sequence Binding Protein 1 (SATB1) and its role in solid tumors.', 'Adaptive and non-adaptive gene expression responses in prostate cancer during androgen deprivation.', 'SATB1, genomic instability and Gleason grading constitute a novel risk score for prostate cancer.', 'SATB1 protein is associated with the epithelial‑mesenchymal transition process in non‑small cell lung cancers.', 'Assessment of the Utility of Gene Positioning Biomarkers in the Stratification of Prostate Cancers.', 'The Role of SATB1 in Tumour Progression and Metastasis.']"""

The aim of the present study was to investigate the value of SWI in distinguishing prostate cancer from benign prostatic hyperplasia and detecting prostatic calcification.  Methodology/principal findings:   23 patients with prostate cancer and 53 patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia proved by prostate biopsy were scanned on a 3.0T MR and a 16-row CT scanner. High-resolution SWI, conventional MRI and CT were performed on all patients. The MRI and CT findings, especially SWI, were analyzed and compared. The analyses revealed that 19 out of 23 patients with prostate cancer presented hemorrhage within tumor area on SWI. However, in 53 patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia, hemorrhage was detected only in 1 patient in prostate by SWI. When comparing SWI, conventional MRI and CT in detecting prostate cancer hemorrhage, out of the 19 patients with prostate cancer who had prostatic hemorrhage detected by SWI, the prostatic hemorrhage was detected in only 7 patients by using conventional MRI, and none was detected by CT. In addition, CT demonstrated calcifications in 22 patients which were all detected by SWI whereas only 3 were detected by conventional MRI. Compared to CT, SWI showed 100% in the diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value(PPV) and negative predictive value(NPV) in detecting calcifications in prostate but conventional MRI demonstrated 13.6% in sensitivity, 100% in specificity, 75% in accuracy, 100% in PPV and 74% in NPV.

Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) widely used in clinics has several caveats as a CaP biomarker. African-American CaP patients have poor prognosis than Caucasians, and notably the serum-PSA does not perform well in this group. Further, some men with low serum-PSA remain unnoticed for CaP until they develop disease. Thus, there is a need to identify a reliable diagnostic and predictive biomarker of CaP. Here, we show that BMI1 stem-cell protein is secretory and could be explored for biomarker use in CaP patients.  Methodology/principal findings:   Semi-quantitative analysis of BMI1 was performed in prostatic tissues of TRAMP (autochthonous transgenic mouse model), human CaP patients, and in cell-based models representing normal and different CaP phenotypes in African-American and Caucasian men, by employing immunohistochemistry, immunoblotting and Slot-blotting. Quantitative analysis of BMI1 and PSA were performed in blood and culture-media of siRNA-transfected and non-transfected cells by employing ELISA. BMI1 protein is (i) secreted by CaP cells, (ii) increased in the apical region of epithelial cells and stromal region in prostatic tumors, and (iii) detected in human blood. BMI1 is detectable in blood of CaP patients in an order of increasing tumor stage, exhibit a positive correlation with serum-PSA and importantly is detectable in patients which exhibit low serum-PSA. The clinical significance of BMI1 as a biomarker could be ascertained from observation that CaP cells secrete this protein in higher levels than cells representative of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).  Conclusions/significance:   BMI1 could be developed as a dual bio-marker (serum and biopsy) for the diagnosis and prognosis of CaP in Caucasian and African-American men.

However, some locally advanced cancers develop radiation resistance and recur after therapy; therefore, the development of radiation-sensitizing compounds is essential for treatment of these tumors. DOC-2/DAB2 interactive protein (DAB2IP), which is a novel member of the Ras-GTPase activating protein family and a regulator of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-Akt activity, is often downregulated in aggressive PCa. Our previous studies have shown that loss of DAB2IP results in radioresistance in PCa cells primarily because of accelerated DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair kinetics, robust G(2)/M checkpoint control, and evasion of apoptosis. A novel DNA-PKcs inhibitor NU7441 can significantly enhance the effect of radiation in DAB2IP-deficient PCa cells. This enhanced radiation sensitivity after NU7441 treatment is primarily due to delayed DNA DSB repair. More significantly, we found that DAB2IP-deficient PCa cells show dramatic induction of autophagy after treatment with radiation and NU7441. However, restoring DAB2IP expression in PCa cells resulted in decreased autophagy-associated proteins, such as LC3B and Beclin 1, as well as decreased phosphorylation of S6K and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Furthermore, the presence of DAB2IP in PCa cells can lead to more apoptosis in response to combined treatment of NU7441 and ionizing radiation. Taken together, NU7441 is a potent radiosensitizer in aggressive PCa cells and DAB2IP plays a critical role in enhancing PCa cell death after combined treatment with NU7441 and radiation.""","""['Lan Yu', 'Vasu Tumati', 'Shu-Fen Tseng', 'Feng-Ming Hsu', 'D Nathan Kim', 'David Hong', 'Jer-Tsong Hsieh', 'Corbin Jacobs', 'Payal Kapur', 'Debabrata Saha']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Neoplasia""","""['Epothilone B confers radiation dose enhancement in DAB2IP gene knock-down radioresistant prostate cancer cells.', 'Downregulation of human DAB2IP gene expression in prostate cancer cells results in resistance to ionizing radiation.', 'Suppression of DNA-dependent protein kinase sensitize cells to radiation without affecting DSB repair.', 'DNA-PKcs: A promising therapeutic target in human hepatocellular carcinoma?', 'DAB2IP in cancer.', 'Radiotherapy Side Effects: Comprehensive Proteomic Study Unraveled Neural Stem Cell Degenerative Differentiation upon Ionizing Radiation.', 'Effect of Autophagy Inhibitors on Radiosensitivity in DNA Repair-Proficient and -Deficient Glioma Cells.', 'DAB2IP predicts treatment response and prognosis of ESCC patients and modulates its radiosensitivity through enhancing IR-induced activation of the ASK1-JNK pathway.', 'Synergistic radiosensitizing effect of BR101801, a specific DNA-dependent protein kinase inhibitor, in various human solid cancer cells and xenografts.', 'Mitotic phosphorylation of tumor suppressor DAB2IP maintains spindle assembly checkpoint and chromosomal stability through activating PLK1-Mps1 signal pathway and stabilizing mitotic checkpoint complex.']"""

The microfluidic system employed three molded polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) channels on a conductive pyrolytic graphite chip (2.5 × 2.5 cm) inserted into a machined chamber and interfaced with a pump, switching valve, and sample injector. Each of the three PDMS channels encompasses three 3 μL analytical wells. Capture-antibody-decorated single-wall carbon nanotube forests are fabricated in the bottom of the wells. The antigen is captured by these antibodies on the well bottoms. Then, a RuBPY-silica-secondary antibody (Ab2) label is injected to bind to antigen on the array, followed by injection of sacrificial reductant tripropylamine (TPrA) to produce ECL. For detection, the chip is placed into an open-top ECL measuring cell, and the channels are in contact with electrolyte in the chamber. Potential applied at 0.95 V versus Ag/AgCl oxidizes TPrA to produce ECL by redox cycling the RuBPY species in the particles, and ECL light is measured by a charge-coupled device camera. This approach achieved ultralow detection limits of 100 fg mL(-1) for PSA (9 zeptomole) and 10 fg mL(-1) (1 zeptomole) for IL-6 in calf serum, a 10-25-fold improvement of a similar non-microfluidic array.

Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were calculated for PC in first-degree immigrants by country of birth. The immigrants were classified into four groups by SIR and area of origin. Survival in PC was assessed by hazard ratio (HR) in the four groups. In some analyses, clinical stage of PC was assessed by the tumor, node, and metastasis classification.  Results:   The SIR was 0.47 (95% confidence interval 0.43-0.51) for immigrants with the lowest risk, constituting men from Turkey, Middle East, Asia, and Chile.

Methods:   In this randomised, open-label, phase 3 study, we enrolled patients in 29 centres in France and one in Belgium. Eligible patients were older than 18 years and had histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate and radiologically proven metastatic disease; a Karnofsky score of at least 70%; a life expectancy of at least 3 months; and adequate hepatic, haematological, and renal function. They were randomly assigned to receive to ADT (orchiectomy or luteinising hormone-releasing hormone agonists, alone or combined with non-steroidal antiandrogens) alone or in combination with docetaxel (75 mg/m(2) intravenously on the first day of each 21-day cycle; up to nine cycles). Patients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio, with dynamic minimisation to minimise imbalances in previous systemic treatment with ADT, chemotherapy for local disease or isolated rising concentration of serum prostate-specific antigen, and Glass risk groups. Patients, physicians, and data analysts were not masked to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was overall survival. Efficacy analyses were done by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00104715.  Findings:   Between Oct 18, 2004, and Dec 31, 2008, 192 patients were randomly allocated to receive ADT plus docetaxel and 193 to receive ADT alone. Median follow-up was 50 months (IQR 39-63). Median overall survival was 58·9 months (95% CI 50·8-69·1) in the group given ADT plus docetaxel and 54·2 months (42·2-not reached) in that given ADT alone (hazard ratio 1·01, 95% CI 0·75-1·36). 72 serious adverse events were reported in the group given ADT plus docetaxel, of which the most frequent were neutropenia (40 [21%]), febrile neutropenia (six [3%]), abnormal liver function tests (three [2%]), and neutropenia with infection (two [1%]). Four treatment-related deaths occurred in the ADT plus docetaxel group (two of which were neutropenia-related), after which the data monitoring committee recommended treatment with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor.

While the association of XMRV with CFS and PC has recently been discredited, no studies have been performed in Australian patients to investigate the association between PC and XMRV or related murine leukemia virus (MLV) in matched PC and normal tissue.  Methods:   Genomic DNA (gDNA) was purified from matched normal and cancer formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) prostate tissue from 35 Australian PC patients with Gleason scores ranging from 7 - 10. The presence of the ribonuclease L (RNase L) polymorphism R462Q was determined by allele specific PCR. Samples were screened for XMRV and related murine leukemia virus (MLV) variants by qPCR. Contaminating mouse DNA was detected using qPCR targeting mouse intracisternal A particle long terminal repeat DNA.  Results:   gDNA was successfully purified from 94% (66/70) of normal and cancer FFPE prostate tissues. RNase L typing revealed 8% were homozygous (QQ), 60% were heterozygous (RQ) and 32% were wild-type (RR) for the RNase L mutation. None of the 66 samples tested were positive for XMRV or related MLV sequences using broad MLV or XMRV specific primers with detection sensitivities of 1 viral copy of MLV/XMRV and XMRV DNA, respectively.  Conclusions:   Using highly sensitive qPCR we found no evidence of XMRV or related gammaretroviruses in prostate tissues from 35 Australian PC patients.

Patients and methods:   Patients comprised 2058 US veterans with prostate cancer (PCa) enrolled in the Shared Equal-Access Regional Cancer Hospital (SEARCH) database and treated with RP between 1988 and 2010. The association of diabetes with metastasis risk or secondary treatment rates was examined using Cox proportional hazards, adjusting for preoperative and, separately, clinical and postoperative findings. The effect modification by race (black vs white) and obesity (body mass index [BMI] ≥30 vs <30 kg/m(2) ) was tested via interaction terms.  Results:   Men with diabetes had higher BMIs and were more likely to be non-white (all P ≤ 0.001). On multivariable analysis, diabetes was not associated with metastasis risk (P ≥ 0.45), but, among men with diabetes, longer diabetes duration was associated with higher metastasis risk (P ≤ 0.035). When stratified by obesity, diabetes was linked with higher metastasis risk in obese but not in non-obese men (P-interaction ≤ 0.037), but there was no significant interaction with race (P-interaction ≥ 0.56). Diabetes also predicted more aggressive secondary treatment among obese men but less aggressive treatment among non-obese men (hazard ratio 1.39 vs 0.63, P-interaction = 0.006). Where applicable, results were similar for both pre- and postoperative models.  Conclusions:   Diabetes was not associated with metastasis risk overall.

AND WHAT DOES THE STUDY ADD?: Open reconstructive surgery of the lower ureteric segment in adults often requires large incisions, as the basic prerequisite for such complex procedures is wide exposure. Published experience on minimally invasive techniques in this challenging surgical field, e.g. conventional laparoscopy or robot-assisted laparoscopy, still remains limited. We report our experience from one of the largest single institution series on robot-assisted reconstructive surgery of the distal ureter in adults, with a special focus on technical aspects of the different surgical procedures.  Objective:   To describe the feasibility of and operative techniques used during different daVinci® robot-assisted laparoscopic reconstructive procedures of the distal ureter, and to report the short-term outcome of such procedures.  Patients and methods:   Between June 2009 and October 2011, 16 patients underwent robot-assisted operations of the distal ureter because of various underlying pathological conditions. We present a description of each procedure, the incidence of perioperative complications and the results of follow-up examination. The data were collected retrospectively using the patients' records and questionnaires sent to the patients and the referring urologists. The follow-up examinations were done at the discretion of the referring urologists.  Results:   The surgical indications and operative techniques were as follows: seven distal ureteric resections [DUR] with psoas hitch procedures (+/- Boari flap; four), extravesical reimplantation (two) or end-to-end anastomosis (one) because of benign distal ureteric stricture; four DUR with psoas hitch procedure (+/- Boari flap) and pelvic lymphadenectomy for urothelial carcinoma of the ureter; one DUR with psoas hitch procedure and Boari flap because of unexpected locally recurrent prostate cancer; one extravesical reimplantation because of vesico-ureteric reflux; one bilateral intravesical reimplantation of ectopic ureters (as part of a radical prostatectomy); one resection of a non-functioning upper kidney pole with associated megaureter and ureterocele and intravesical reimplantation of lower pole ureter; one resection of pelvic endometriosis and ureterolysis with omental wrap. The median operative duration (including docking/undocking of the robot) was 260 min. There were no intraoperative complications but there was one conversion to open surgery. Complications according to the Clavien-Dindo classification occurred in 12 patients (75%) ≤ 90 days of surgery: 10 (62%) minor (grade I-II) and two (12%) major complications (grades IIIb and IVa, respectively). The median hospital stay after surgery was 7.5 days. At a median follow-up of 10.2 months, 15 patients (94%) remained without signs of urinary tract obstruction and 13 (81%) were asymptomatic.  Conclusions:   Robot-assisted reconstructive surgery of the distal ureter is feasible and can be used without compromising the generally accepted principles of open surgical procedures. The functional outcome was good in short-term follow-up and severe postoperative complications were rare.""","""['Michael Musch', 'Lukas Hohenhorst', 'Anne Pailliart', 'Heinrich Loewen', 'Yadollah Davoudi', 'Darko Kroepfl']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Robot-assisted distal ureteral reconstruction for benign pathology: Current state.', 'Experience with robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery of the lower ureteral segment in adults.', 'Robot-assisted technique for Boari flap ureteric reimplantation: replicating the techniques of open surgery in robotics.', 'Robot-assisted Boari flap and psoas hitch ureteric reimplantation: technique insight and outcomes of a case series with ≥1\xa0year of follow-up.', 'Current status of robot-assisted laparoscopic ureteral reimplantation and reconstruction.', 'Open Ureteric Exploration in Aminu Kano Teaching Hospital: Indications and Outcome.', 'Robot-assisted laparoscopic ureteral reimplant: A single-center experience.', 'The robot-assisted ureteral reconstruction in adult: A narrative review on the surgical techniques and contemporary outcomes.', 'Laparoscopic and Robotic Management of Ureteral Stricture in Adults.', 'Robot-assisted distal ureteral reconstruction for benign pathology: Current state.']"""

AND WHAT DOES THE STUDY ADD?: The development of side effects characteristic for the different treatment methods with impact on the patients' quality of life plays a growing role for individual patients with early stage prostate cancer. Using permanent brachytherapy a high dose to the prostate can be applied with a steep dose gradient to the normal tissue. However, small partial volumes of normal tissue may be exposed to high doses inducing special side effects including lower urinary tract symptoms and/or erectile dysfunction. In the literature there are only few publications so far regarding segmental dosimetry and its influence on side effects and the results are conflicting. We could not identify any dosimetric parameter in segmental dosimetry that may have an influence at certain time intervals on the development of side effects such as lower urinary tract symptoms or erectile dysfunction. However, we could state clearly that the preoperative situation is the most important factor for postoperative outcome.  Objective:   To report on the side effects of patients with low to low-intermediate risk prostate cancer treated with permanent interstitial brachytherapy with special emphasis on segmental dosimetry.  Patients and methods:   A series of 186 consecutive patients treated for early stage prostate cancer receiving definitive I-125 brachytherapy (permanent seed implantation) between November 2001 and April 2005 at our institution were examined for the development of side effects. Morbidity was assessed prospectively using the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5) in a mean follow-up interval of 30 months. The scores were correlated with segmental dosimetry performed 6 weeks after the implantation.  Results:   The mean postoperative dose to 90% of the prostate volume (D90) was 180.2 Gy, the mean preoperative IPSS 7.2 and the mean IIEF-5 14.35, with all scores showing a maximum deterioration after 6 weeks with normalization after 24 months. After correlating the segmental dosimetry and the scores at different time intervals, only the baseline scores remained statistically significant in multivariate regression analysis at all time intervals (P < 0.00).  Conclusions:   We could not demonstrate a correlation of segmental dosimetry with induction of side effects. There is no relationship between dose exposure of partial volumes and the development of radiation-induced toxicities. The preoperative situation regarding lower urinary tract symptoms and erectile function are the most important factors for postoperative outcome.""","""['Andreas Meyer', 'Julia Wassermann', 'Antje Warszawski-Baumann', 'Rolf Baumann', 'Stefan Machtens', 'Johann H Karstens', 'Hans Christiansen', 'Axel Merseburger', 'Markus A Kuczyk', 'Christoph von Klot']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['The nature and extent of urinary morbidity in relation to prostate brachytherapy urethral dosimetry.', 'Prospective assessment of patient-reported long-term urinary morbidity and associated quality of life changes after 125I prostate brachytherapy.', 'Single-fraction high-dose-rate brachytherapy and hypofractionated external beam radiotherapy for men with intermediate-risk prostate cancer: analysis of short- and medium-term toxicity and quality of life.', 'Urinary morbidity and incontinence following transurethral resection of the prostate after brachytherapy.', 'Importance of post-implant dosimetry in permanent prostate brachytherapy.', 'Impact of post-implant dosimetric parameters on the quality of life of patients treated with low-dose rate brachytherapy for localised prostate cancer: results of a single-institution study.']"""

Initial chemotherapeutic treatment could be successful; however, resistance development urges the use of higher toxic doses accompanied by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The establishment of more effective treatments that can overcome or circumvent chemoresistance has become a priority. We recently demonstrated that venom extracted from Walterinnesia aegyptia (WEV) either alone or in combination with silica nanoparticles (WEV+NPs) mediated the growth arrest and apoptosis of prostate cancer cells. In the present study, we evaluated the impact of WEV alone and WEV+NP on proliferation and apoptosis of MM cells.  Methods:   The impacts of WEV alone and WEV+NP were monitored in MM cells from 70 diagnosed patients. The influences of WEV and WEV+NP were assessed with flow cytometry analysis.  Results:   WEV alone and WEV+NP decreased the viability of MM cells. Using a CFSE proliferation assay, we found that WEV+NP strongly inhibited MM cell proliferation. Furthermore, analysis of the cell cycle using the propidium iodide (PI) staining method indicated that WEV+NP strongly altered the cell cycle of MM cells and enhanced the induction of apoptosis.

These responses are associated with extensive transcriptional changes, modulation of a chemokine/chemokine receptor gene signature, and activation of the pleiotropic inflammatory mediator, STAT3. In the absence of CypD, active STAT3 enhances cell proliferation via accelerated entry into S-phase and stimulates autocrine/paracrine cell motility through Cxcl12-Cxcr4-directed chemotaxis.

Pathologists include the possibility of an IPC in their reports based on the Gleason score and tumor volume. This study determined the accuracy of pathological data in the identification of IPC in radical prostatectomy (RP) specimens.  Materials and methods:   Of 592 radical prostatectomy specimens examined in our laboratory from 2001 to 2010, 20 patients harbored IPC and exhibited biopsy findings suggestive of IPC. These biopsy features served as the criteria to define patients with potentially insignificant tumor in this population. The results of the prostate biopsies and surgical specimens of the 592 patients were compared.  Results:   The twenty patients who had IPC in both biopsy and RP were considered real positive cases. All patients were divided into groups based on their diagnoses following RP: true positives (n = 20), false positives (n = 149), true negatives (n = 421), false negatives (n = 2). The accuracy of the pathological data alone for the prediction of IPC was 91.4%, the sensitivity was 91% and the specificity was 74%.

Interactions between Cav-1 and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6 (LRP6) were reported to be important for the regulation of Wnt-β-catenin (β-cat) signaling. Cav-1 also interacts with insulin and IGF-I receptors (IGF-IR/IR) and can stimulate IR kinase activities. We found positive correlation between Cav-1 and LRP6 expression in both human primary prostate cancer and metastasis tissues and in PC-3 cells. Cav-1 stimulation of Wnt-β-cat signaling and c-Myc levels was positively associated with LRP6 expression in LNCaP, PC-3, and DU145 prostate cancer cells. Importantly, LRP6 and, to a lesser extent, Cav-1 were found to stimulate aerobic glycolysis. These activities were positively associated with the expression of HK2 and Glut3 and shown to be dependent on Akt signaling by both gene knockdown and chemical inhibition methods. We further showed that Cav-1 and LRP6 exert their effects on Akt and glycolytic activities by stimulating IGF-IR/IR signaling. Overall, our results show that Cav-1 interacts with LRP6 to generate an integrated signaling module that leads to the activation of IGF-IR/IR and results in stimulation of Akt-mTORC1 signaling and aerobic glycolysis in prostate cancer.""","""['Salahaldin A Tahir', 'Guang Yang', 'Alexei Goltsov', 'Ki-Duk Song', 'Chengzhen Ren', 'Jianxiang Wang', 'Wenjun Chang', 'Timothy C Thompson']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Cancer Res""","""['Rottlerin induces Wnt co-receptor LRP6 degradation and suppresses both Wnt/β-catenin and mTORC1 signaling in prostate and breast cancer cells.', 'Silibinin inhibits Wnt/β-catenin signaling by suppressing Wnt co-receptor LRP6 expression in human prostate and breast cancer cells.', 'The sensitivity to beta-carotene growth-inhibitory and proapoptotic effects is regulated by caveolin-1 expression in human colon and prostate cancer cells.', 'Caveolin-1 and polymerase I and transcript release factor: new players in insulin-like growth factor-I receptor signaling.', 'The role of caveolin-1 in prostate cancer: clinical implications.', 'Metabolic reprogramming of cancer-associated fibroblasts in pancreatic cancer contributes to the intratumor heterogeneity of PET-CT.', 'Role of Metabolism and Metabolic Pathways in Prostate Cancer.', 'Importance of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs) in cancer cells.', 'Druggable Metabolic Vulnerabilities Are Exposed and Masked during Progression to Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'CAV1 alleviated CaOx stones formation via suppressing autophagy-dependent ferroptosis.']"""

Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) secrete various cytokines that can regulate the behaviour of neighbouring cell. However, little is known about the role of BM-MSCs in influencing the migration and the invasion of prostate cancer cells. We hypothesize that the stromal cell-derived factor-1α released by BM-MSCs may play a pivotal role in these processes. To study the interaction between factors secreted by BM-MSCs and prostate cancer cells we established an in vitro model of transwell co-culture of BM-MSCs and prostate cancer cells DU145. Using this model, we have shown that BM-MSCs produce soluble factors which increase the motility of prostate cancer cells DU145. Neutralization of stromal cell-derived factor-1α (SDF1α) via a blocking antibody significantly limits the chemoattractive effect of bone marrow MSCs. Moreover, soluble factors produced by BM-MSCs greatly activate prosurvival kinases, namely AKT and ERK 1/2. We provide further evidence that SDF1α is involved in the interaction between prostate cancer cells and BM-MSCs.

Particularly, the sustained stimulation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R), stem cell factor (SCF) receptor KIT, transforming growth factor-β receptors (TGF-βRs) and Notch and their downstream signalling elements such as phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/molecular target of rapamycin (mTOR) may lead to an enhanced activity of HIFs. Moreover, the up-regulation of HIFs in cancer cells may also occur in the hypoxic intratumoral regions formed within primary and secondary neoplasms as well as in leukaemic cells and metastatic prostate and breast cancer cells homing in the hypoxic endosteal niche of bone marrow. The activated HIFs may induce the expression of numerous gene products such as induced pluripotency-associated transcription factors (Oct-3/4, Nanog and Sox-2), glycolysis- and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) programme-associated molecules, including CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4), snail and twist, microRNAs and angiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). These gene products in turn can play critical roles for high self-renewal ability, survival, altered energy metabolism, invasion and metastases of cancer cells, angiogenic switch and treatment resistance.

Background:   RALP is an innovative surgical technique intended to minimise the risk of long-term postoperative urinary incontinence in localised prostate cancer. Studies have shown that urinary function and quality of life domains can be adversely affected following RALP; however, the impact on men's lives has been hitherto unreported.  Design:   A qualitative study using hermeneutic phenomenology  Methods:   Face-to-face, in-depth audio-recorded interviews with seven men (aged 57-71) who had recently undergone RALP and defined themselves as continent of urine. Data were inductively analysed for themes using an adapted version of Diekelmann et al. [1989, The NLN Criteria of Appraisal of Baccalaureate Programs: A Critical Hermeneutic Analysis, 1st edn. National League for Nursing (NLN) Press, New York, NY] framework.  Results:   Men's experiences of regaining continence were situated within a wider network of personal and social relationships, and cultural structures. Themes included 'what was forecast', 'after-sales service', 'new plumbing', 'sense of self'. Men adopted a variety of practical coping strategies: preventing incontinence; improving incontinence; and dealing with lack of bladder control.  Conclusion:   The need to regain a sense of control over their lives resulted in all men developing coping mechanisms in order that they could resume their societal roles, which were salient to their personal identity, inferring that men's ability to cope with incontinence after RALP was dependent on factors other than urinary leakage alone.  Relevance to clinical practice:   Knowledge of the potential impact of RALP could help nurses tailor appropriate interventions. Incontinence is individually interpreted and may not be well-addressed by traditional 'one-size fits all' preoperative programmes or information. Flexible and imaginative options (e.g., activity-focused interventions; buddy systems; internet programmes; telephone follow-up) for preoperative and postoperative support and activities for men may improve men's uptake of such services, through specialist nurse or peer support.""","""['Jo Waller', 'Natalie Pattison']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Clin Nurs""","""[]"""

Within the cell, cholesterol homeostasis is maintained by two master transcription factors: sterol-regulatory element-binding protein 2 (SREBP-2) and liver X receptor (LXR). We previously showed that the androgen receptor, a major player in prostate cell physiology, toggles these transcription factors to promote cholesterol accumulation. Given that prostate cancer therapy targets the androgen receptor, selecting for cells with altered androgen receptor activity, how would this affect SREBP-2 and LXR activity? Using a novel prostate cancer progression model, we explored how this crosstalk between the androgen receptor and cholesterol homeostasis changes during prostate cancer development.  Methodology/principal findings:   Firstly, we characterised our progression model, which involved 1) culturing LNCaP cells at physiological testosterone levels to generate androgen-tolerant LNCaP-305 cells, and 2) culturing LNCaP-305 with the anti-androgen casodex to generate castration-resistant LNCaP-364 cells. This progression was accompanied by upregulated androgen receptor expression, typically seen clinically, and a reduction in androgen receptor activity. Although this influenced how SREBP-2 and LXR target genes responded to androgen treatment, cellular cholesterol levels and their response to changing sterol status was similar in all LNCaP sub-lines.  Conclusion/significance:   Overall cholesterol homeostasis is unaffected by changing androgen receptor activity in prostate cancer cells. This does not negate the relationship between androgens and cholesterol homeostasis, but rather suggests that other factors compensate for altered androgen receptor activity. Given that cholesterol regulation is maintained during progression, this supports the growing idea that cholesterol metabolism is a suitable target for prostate cancer.""","""['James Robert Krycer', 'Andrew John Brown']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Cross-talk between the androgen receptor and the liver X receptor: implications for cholesterol homeostasis.', 'A key regulator of cholesterol homoeostasis, SREBP-2, can be targeted in prostate cancer cells with natural products.', 'Androgen receptor signaling and vitamin D receptor action in prostate cancer cells.', 'The development of Casodex (bicalutamide): preclinical studies.', 'Cholesterol accumulation in prostate cancer: a classic observation from a modern perspective.', 'Global redox proteome and phosphoproteome analysis reveals redox switch in Akt.', 'Insulin Enhances Migration and Invasion in Prostate Cancer Cells by Up-Regulation of FOXC2.', 'Proteomic Analysis of Charcoal-Stripped Fetal Bovine Serum Reveals Changes in the Insulin-like Growth Factor Signaling Pathway.', 'Properties of Native High-Density Lipoproteins Inspire Synthesis of Actively Targeted In Vivo siRNA Delivery Vehicles.', 'Bicarbonate alters cellular responses in respiration assays.']"""

Expression profiling and chromatin-immunoprecipitation analyses revealed that FOXP3 regulated the BRCA1-mediated DNA repair program.

We describe primary care physicians' reports of their prescreening discussions about the potential harms and benefits of prostate cancer screening.  Methods:   Members of the American Academy of Family Physicians National Research Network responded to a survey that included (1) an indicator of practice styles related to discussing harms and benefits of prostate-specific antigen testing and providing a screening recommendation or letting patients decide, and (2) indicators reflecting physicians' beliefs about prostate cancer screening. The survey was conducted between July 2007 and January 2008.  Results:   Of 426 physicians 246 (57.7%) completed the survey questionnaire. Compared with physicians who ordered screening without discussion (24.3%), physicians who discussed harms and benefits with patients and then let them decide (47.7%) were more likely to endorse beliefs that scientific evidence does not support screening, that patients should be told about the lack of evidence, and that patients have a right to know the limitations of screening; they were also less likely to endorse the belief that there was no need to educate patients because they wanted to be screened. Concerns about medicolegal risk associated with not screening were more common among physicians who discussed the harms and benefits and recommended screening than among physicians who discussed screening and let their patients decide.  Conclusions:   Much of the variability in physicians' use of an informed decision-making process can be attributed to beliefs about screening.

We recently demonstrated that insulin can activate de novo steroidogenesis in PC cells, a major pathway for reactivation of androgen pathways and PC progression. IGF2 can activate the IGF1 receptor (IGF1R) or insulin receptor (INSR) or hybrids of these two receptors. We therefore hypothesized that IGF2 may contribute to PC progression via de novo steroidogenesis. IGF2 mRNA but not IGF2 receptor mRNA expression was increased in patient samples during progression to castrate-resistant PC as was immunoreactivity to INSR and IGF1R antibodies. Treatment of androgen receptor (AR)-positive PC cell lines LNCaP and 22RV1 with IGF2 for 48 h resulted in increased expression of steroidogenic enzyme mRNA and protein, including steroid acute regulatory protein (StAR), cytochrome p450 family member (CYP)17A1, aldo-keto reductase family member (AKR)1C3 and hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (HSD)17B3. IGF2 treatment resulted in increased steady state steroid levels and increased de novo steroidogenesis resulting in AR activation as demonstrated by PSA mRNA induction. Inhibition of the IGF1R/INSR signalling axis attenuated the effects of IGF2 on steroid hormone synthesis.

Expression array analysis of the patient cohort from a different institute showed a large overlap in genes that were positively correlated with ERG overexpression, including TDRD1. In late-stage prostate cancer, TDRD1 was also coexpressed with ERG overexpression, although a proportion of ERG-negative late-stage samples expressed TDRD1. TDRD1 expression was not associated with ETV1 overexpression. In the prostate cancer cell line VCaP, downregulation of ERG by shRNA lead to a lower expression level of TDRD1 and resulted in a decreased activity of the TDRD1 promoter.

Objective:   To test the hypothesis that local wound infusion with bupivacaine followed by continuous infusion could reduce postoperative need for opioids in patients undergoing retropubic prostatectomy.  Design:   Single-centre prospective, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial.  Setting:   A major university hospital in Denmark.  Patients:   Following written informed consent, 60 patients scheduled for prostatectomy were recruited to the study and 50 completed the protocol to reach data analysis.  Interventions:   Thirty millilitre bolus of bupivacaine (2.5 mg ml) or isotonic saline was injected through a subfascially placed wound catheter followed by continuous infusion at 5 ml h during the following 48 h. All patients were prescribed paracetamol, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, morphine and oxycodone if needed.  Outcome measures:   Primary outcome was the opioid requirement. Secondary outcomes included pain scores at rest and with activity, and nausea and vomiting scores.  Results:   The total amount of morphine required during the postoperative period was not significantly higher (P=0.49) in the placebo group (12 mg, 25 to 75% percentile 5 to 18) than the bupivacaine group (10 mg, 25 to 75% percentile 0 to 16). Similarly, the total amount of oxycodone required was not significantly different (P=0.99) and was equal among the groups (5 mg, 25 to 75% percentile 5 to 10). At 2 h postoperatively, a significantly (P=0.0488) higher number of patients required additional morphine in the placebo group. No differences between the groups were detected at any time point regarding pain scores or the presence of nausea and vomiting.

The purpose of this paper is to describe histological inflammation patterns in men on AS who underwent serial prostate biopsy for disease monitoring.  Methods:   We reviewed records of men on AS from January 1999 through February 2011 who had a diagnostic plus ≥1 repeat transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsies performed at our institution. The type and degree of inflammatory infiltrate were grossly reviewed and scored for each patient's biopsy by a single pathologist. Relationship of inflammation severity and number of serial biopsies was assessed using a repeated measures mixed model. Unpaired t-test and χ(2)-square analysis assessed variance in degree of inflammation and location of inflammation relative to cancer grade progression defined as Gleason sum increase.  Results:   Fifty-six men met study inclusion criteria. Mean age was 62.1 (6.5) years, 71% were stage cT1c, 79% had a PSA level <10 ng ml(-1), and 98% had diagnostic Gleason sum ≤6. A small, statistically significant increase in maximum chronic inflammation (CI) scores with greater number of repeat biopsies was observed. CI scores were not associated with number of biopsies based on upgrade status. The main limitation to our study is our small sample size. Potential unmeasured confounders, such as unreported antibiotic use or symptomatic prostatitis, may have also affected our findings.

With genome-wide AR-binding sites mapped to high resolution, studies have recently reported AR as a transcriptional repressor. How AR inhibits gene expression and how this contributes to prostate cancer, however, are incompletely understood. Through meta-analysis of microarray data, here we nominate nephroblastoma overexpressed (NOV) as a top androgen-repressed gene. We show that NOV is directly suppressed by androgen through the AR. AR occupies the NOV enhancer and communicates with the NOV promoter through DNA looping. AR activation recruits the polycomb group protein EZH2, which subsequently catalyzes histone H3 lysine 27 tri-methylation around the NOV promoter, thus leading to repressive chromatin remodeling and epigenetic silencing. Concordantly, AR and EZH2 inhibition synergistically restored NOV expression. NOV is downregulated in human prostate cancer wherein AR and EZH2 are upregulated. Functionally, NOV inhibits prostate cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo. NOV reconstitution reverses androgen-induced cell growth and NOV knockdown drives androgen-independent cell growth. In addition, NOV expression is restored by hormone-deprivation therapies in mice and prostate cancer patients. Therefore, using NOV as a model gene we gained further understanding of the mechanisms underlying AR-mediated transcriptional repression. Our findings establish a tumor-suppressive role of NOV in prostate cancer and suggest that one important, but previously underestimated, manner by which AR contributes to prostate cancer progression is through inhibition of key tumor-suppressor genes.""","""['L Wu', 'C Runkle', 'H-J Jin', 'J Yu', 'J Li', 'X Yang', 'T Kuzel', 'C Lee', 'J Yu']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['Polycomb-Mediated Disruption of an Androgen Receptor Feedback Loop Drives Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'PVT1 signals an androgen-dependent transcriptional repression program in prostate cancer cells and a set of the repressed genes predicts high-risk tumors.', 'RUNX1, an androgen- and EZH2-regulated gene, has differential roles in AR-dependent and -independent prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptor-driven chromatin looping in prostate cancer.', 'Maintaining and reprogramming genomic androgen receptor activity in prostate cancer.', 'Neurokinin-1 receptor drives PKCɑ-AURKA/N-Myc signaling to facilitate the neuroendocrine progression of prostate cancer.', 'The advance of CCN3 in fibrosis.', 'Androgen deprivation restores ARHGEF2 to promote neuroendocrine differentiation of prostate cancer.', 'A comprehensive multi-omics analysis reveals molecular features associated with cancer via RNA cross-talks in the Notch signaling pathway.', 'High intratumoral dihydrotestosterone is associated with antiandrogen resistance in VCaP prostate cancer xenografts in castrated mice.']"""

Air-filled rectal balloon has been used most commonly, but creates dose perturbation at the air-tissue interface. In this study, we evaluate the effects of rectal balloon-filling materials on the dose distribution to the target and organs at risk. The dosimetric impact of rectal balloon filling was studied in detail for a typical prostate patient, and the general effect of the balloon filling was investigated from a study of ten prostate patients covering a wide range of anterior-posterior and left-right separations, as well as rectal and bladder volumes. Hounsfield units (HU) of the rectal balloon filling was changed from -1000 HU to 1000 HU at an interval of 250 HU, and the corresponding changes in the relative electron density (RED) was calculated. For each of the HU of the rectal balloon filling, a seven-field IMRT plan was generated with 6 MV and 15 MV photon beams, respectively. Dosimetric evaluation was performed with the AAA algorithm for inhomogeneity corrections. A detailed study of the rectal balloon filling shows that the GTV, PTV, rectal, and bladder mean dose decreased with increasing values of RED in the rectal balloon. There is significant underdosage in the target volume at the rectum-prostate interface with an air-filled balloon as compared to that with a water-filled balloon for both 6 MV and 15 MV beams. While the dosimetric effect of the rectal balloon filling is reduced when averaged over ten patients, generally an air-filled balloon results in lower minimum dose and lower mean dose in the overlap region (and possibly the PTV) compared to those produced by water-filled or contrast-filled balloons. Dose inhomogeneity in the target volume is increased with an air-filled rectal balloon. Thus a water-filled or contrast-filled rectal balloon is preferred to an air-filled rectal balloon in EBRT of prostate treatment.""","""['Shiv P Srivastava', 'Indra J Das', 'Arvind Kumar', 'Peter A S Johnstone', 'Chee-Wai Cheng']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Appl Clin Med Phys""","""['Rectal wall sparing by dosimetric effect of rectal balloon used during intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) for prostate cancer.', 'The use of rectal balloon during the delivery of intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) for prostate cancer: more than just a prostate gland immobilization device?', 'Rectal dose sparing with a balloon catheter and ultrasound localization in conformal radiation therapy for prostate cancer.', 'The use of spatial dose gradients and probability density function to evaluate the effect of internal organ motion for prostate IMRT treatment planning.', 'The influence of a rectal balloon tube as internal immobilization device on variations of volumes and dose-volume histograms during treatment course of conformal radiotherapy for prostate cancer.']"""

A series of 22 patients diagnosed with prostate adenocarcinoma was treated with 45 Gy external beam and 20 Gy dose rate brachytherapy. Principal component analysis was applied to model the shapes of the rectum and urethra dose-volume histograms. We used logistic regression to measure the correlations between the principal components and the incidence of rectal bleeding and urethra stricture. We also calculated the equivalent uniform dose (EUD) and normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) for the urethra and rectum, and tumor control probability (TCP) for the prostate using BioSuite software. We evaluated their correlations with rectal and urethra toxicity. The rectum DVHs are well described by one principal component (PC1), which accounts for 93.5% of the variance in their shapes. The urethra DVHs are described by two principal components, PC1 and PC2, which account for 94.98% and 3.15% of the variance, respectively. Multivariate exact logistic regression suggests that urethra PC2 is a good predictor of stricture, with Nagelkerke's R2 estimated at 0.798 and a Wald criterion of 5.421 (p &lt; 0.021). The average NTCPs were 0.06% ± 0.04% and 1.25% ± 0.22% for the rectum and urethra, respectively. The average TCP was 85.29% ± 2.28%.

Methods:   IRB-approved radical prostatectomy database was queried. Patients were stratified as low, intermediate, and high risk according to D'Amico's risk classification. Postoperative prostate-specific antigen (PSA) values were obtained every 3 mo for the first year, then biannually and annually thereafter. Biochemical recurrence was defined as ≥0.2ng/mL. Patients receiving adjuvant or salvage treatment were included. Positive surgical margin was defined as presence of cancer cells at inked resection margin in the final specimen. Margin presence (negative/positive), margin multiplicity (single/multiple), and margin length (≤ 3mm focal and >3mm extensive) were noted. Kaplan-Meier curves of biochemical recurrence-free survival (BRFS) as a function of SM were generated.

Methods:   Between January 2009 and June 2012, a total of 193 men (aged 49-84 years, median 67 years) with at least 2 transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS) procedures and concurrent serum PSA measurements underwent prostate biopsy because of suspicion of PCa. The total group were classified into PCa and non-PCa groups, and the variables of the two groups were compared. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to investigate which variables were predictove. The diagnostic values of PSAV, PSAVD and prostate-specific antigen density (PSAD) were compared using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis.  Results:   Prostate cancer was diagnosed in 44 (22.8%) of the 193 men. There were significant differences between the groups in last and initial prostate volumes determined by TRUS, initial age, last serum PSA levels, PSAV, PSAD and PSAVD. After adjusting for confounding factors, the odds ratios of PCa across the quartile of PSAVD were 1, 4.06, 10.6, and 18.9 (P for trend <0.001).The area under the ROC curves (AUCs) of PSAD (0.779) and PSAVD (0.776) were similar and both significantly greater than that of PSA (AUC 0.667). PSAVD was a significantly better indicator of PCa than PSAV (AUC 0.736). There was no statistical significant difference between the AUC of PSAV and that of last serum PSA level. The sensitivity and specificity of PSAVD at a cutoff of 0.023ng in participants with last serum PSA levels of 4.0 ng/mL-10.0 ng was 73.7% and 70.7%, respectively.

Results:   Patient-physician communication of diagnosis, treatment options, and specificities of AS featured prominently within participants' interviews.

However, some participants reported being confused about their diagnosis details and specific AS protocols, and resisted traditional physician-patient hierarchies, desiring more collaborative decision-making processes. In this regard communications emerged as ""threat,"" in that participants lacked and/or lost confidence in their physician and were uncertain and anxious about the legitimacy of AS. These findings were interpreted within a gender framework, showing how patients drew on an array of masculine ideals, including stoicism, denying illness, and respecting expertise in different ways.

The focus of this study was to explore the meaning of work among prostate cancer survivors and to describe the linkages between masculinity and work following prostate cancer treatment.  Method:   Fifty prostate cancer survivors who were in paid employment prior to their diagnosis completed a semistructured interview following completion of their treatment and of these, 41 also completed a 12-month follow-up interview. Framework analysis of the 91 transcripts was undertaken.  Results:   The majority of the men had returned to work at the 12-month interview.

A degree of embarrassment and concern about residual side effects and whether these would present a challenge within the workplace was apparent among our sample and was compounded by a reluctance to disclose these.  Conclusions:   The descriptions provided by the men in this study reveal that the experience of prostate cancer can lead to challenges for both social and work-related roles. The influence of prostate cancer on men's reports of masculinity was variable, and recognition of these differences is required.

This longitudinal study uses a cancer-specific assessment to determine whether cancer-related masculine threat (CMT) predicts prostate-related (i.e., urinary, bowel, sexual) functioning over time, and whether cancer-related emotional approach coping (EAC) processes explain these relationships. Whether coping self-efficacy and emotional suppression explain effects of CMT on EAC also is tested.  Methods:   Sixty-six men (M age = 65.76; SD = 9.04) who underwent radical prostatectomy and/or radiation therapy for localized prostate cancer within two years were assessed on physical and psychological variables at study entry (T1), and two (T2) and four (T3) months later.  Results:   Analyses controlling for baseline functioning and age revealed that CMT predicted declines in (T1 to T3) urinary (B = -.21, p < .05), bowel (B = -.24, p < .05), and sexual (B = -.17, p < .05) function. CMT also predicted decreased emotional processing (T1 to T2), but not emotional expression. Decreased emotional processing predicted declining prostate-related functioning and helps explain the effect of CMT on bowel and sexual (but not urinary) functioning. Low coping self-efficacy (p < .05), but not emotional suppression, was a mechanism by which CMT predicted emotional processing.  Conclusions:   The extent to which men believe that cancer is inconsistent with their masculinity exacerbates declines in prostate-related functioning following cancer treatment. CMT likely shapes coping responses and negatively affects the efficacy of emotion-directed coping. Emotion-regulating coping processes, particularly the ability to process cancer-related emotions, appears to be one pathway through which gender role affects recovery from prostate cancer.""","""['Michael A Hoyt', 'Annette L Stanton', 'Michael R Irwin', 'KaMala S Thomas']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Health Psychol""","""['Inflammatory biomarkers and emotional approach coping in men with prostate cancer.', 'Gender role conflict and emotional approach coping in men with cancer.', 'Loss of masculine identity, marital affection, and sexual bother in men with localized prostate cancer.', 'Coping with prostate cancer: a meta-analytic review.', 'Biopsychosocial aspects of prostate cancer.', 'The Prospective Effects of Coping Strategies on Mental Health and Resilience at Five Months after HSCT.', 'Effect of sex on psychological distress and fatigue over time in a prospective cohort of cancer survivors.', 'The impact of hegemonic masculine ideals on self-esteem in prostate cancer patients undergoing androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) compared to ADT-naïve patients.', 'Strengthening Capacity for Prostate Cancer Early Diagnosis in West Africa Amidst the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Realist Approach to Rethinking and Operationalizing the World Health Organization 2017 Guide to Cancer Early Diagnosis.', ""Boys Don't Cry: Examining Sex Disparities in Behavioral Oncology Referral Rates for AYA Cancer Patients.""]"""

Tumor growth is also dependent on angiogenesis. Diabetes affects several cancers in a tissue-specific way. For example, it positively correlates with the incidence of breast cancer but negatively correlates with the incidence of prostate cancer. The tissue-specific molecular mechanisms activated by hyperglycemia that control angiogenesis are unknown. Here we describe a novel tissue- and cell-specific molecular pathway that is activated by high glucose and regulates angiogenesis.  Methods and results:   We have identified microRNA 467 (miR-467) as a translational suppressor of thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1), a potent antiangiogenic protein that is implicated in the pathogenesis of several diabetic complications. miR-467 was upregulated by hyperglycemia in a tissue-specific manner. It was induced by high glucose in microvascular endothelial cells and in breast cancer cells, where it suppressed the production of TSP-1 by sequestering mRNA in the nonpolysomal fraction. Mutation of the miR-467 binding site in TSP-1 3' UTR or miR-467 inhibitor relieved the translational silencing and restored TSP-1 production. In in vivo angiogenesis models, miR-467 promoted the growth of blood vessels, and TSP-1 was the main mediator of this effect. Breast cancer tumors showed increased growth in hyperglycemic mice and expressed higher levels of miR-467. The antagonist of miR-467 prevented the hyperglycemia-induced tumor growth.  Conclusions:   Our results demonstrate that miR-467 is implicated in the control of angiogenesis in response to high glucose, which makes it an attractive tissue-specific potential target for therapeutic regulation of aberrant angiogenesis and cancer growth in diabetes.""","""['Sanghamitra Bhattacharyya', 'Kristina Sul', 'Irene Krukovets', 'Carla Nestor', 'Jianbo Li', 'Olga Stenina Adognravi']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""J Am Heart Assoc""","""['Feeding sugar to tumors: with a supplement of miR?', 'Inhibition of hyperglycemia-induced angiogenesis and breast cancer tumor growth by systemic injection of microRNA-467 antagonist.', 'Cell type-specific post-transcriptional regulation of production of the potent antiangiogenic and proatherogenic protein thrombospondin-1 by high glucose.', 'MicroRNA miR-27b rescues bone marrow-derived angiogenic cell function and accelerates wound healing in type 2 diabetes mellitus.', 'MicroRNA-503 and the extended microRNA-16 family in angiogenesis.', 'Endothelial response to glucose: dysfunction, metabolism, and transport.', 'Metabolic risk factors of ovarian cancer: a review.', 'Elevated IgE promotes cardiac fibrosis by suppressing miR-486a-5p.', 'High glucose: an emerging association between diabetes mellitus and cancer progression.', 'Thrombospondin 1 in Metabolic Diseases.', 'Hyperglycemia-Induced miR-467 Drives Tumor Inflammation and Growth in Breast Cancer.']"""

Furthermore, ROS contributes to the delicate balance between tumor cell survival and death. However, the mechanisms by which tumor cells decide to elicit survival or death signals during oxidative stress are not completely understood. We have previously reported that ROS enhanced tumorigenic functions in prostate cancer cells, such as transendothelial migration and invasion, which depended on CXCR4 and AKT signaling. Here, we report a novel mechanism by which ROS facilitated cell death through activation of AKT. We initially observed that ROS enhanced the expression of phosphorylated AKT (p-AKT) in 22Rv1 human prostate cancer cells. The tumor suppressor PTEN, a negative regulator of AKT signaling, was rendered catalytically inactive through oxidation by ROS, although the expression levels remained consistent. Despite these events, cells still underwent apoptosis.

In phase 1 trials, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) declines were seen in patients with advanced prostate cancer. We conducted a single-arm phase 2 study evaluating KX2-391 in men with chemotherapy-naïve bone-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).  Methods:   We treated 31 patients with oral KX2-391 (40 mg twice-daily) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint was 24-week progression-free survival (PFS); a 50 % success rate was pre-defined as clinically significant. Secondary endpoints included PSA progression-free survival (PPFS) and PSA response rates. Exploratory outcomes included pharmacokinetic studies, circulating tumor cell (CTC) enumeration, and analysis of markers of bone resorption [urinary N-telopeptide (uNTx); C-telopeptide (CTx)] and formation [bone alkaline phosphatase (BAP); osteocalcin].  Results:   The trial closed early after accrual of 31 patients, due to a pre-specified futility rule. PFS at 24 weeks was 8 %, and median PFS was 18.6 weeks. The PSA response rate (≥ 30 % decline) was 10 %, and median PPFS was 5.0 weeks. Additionally, 18 % of men with unfavorable (≥ 5) CTCs at baseline converted to favorable (<5) CTCs with treatment. The proportion of men with declines in bone turnover markers was 32 % for uNTx, 21 % for CTx, 10 % for BAP, and 25 % for osteocalcin. In pharmacokinetic studies, median C max was 61 (range 16-129) ng/mL, and median AUC was 156 (35-348) ng h/mL. Common toxicities included hepatic derangements, myelosuppression, fatigue, nausea, and constipation.  Conclusion:   KX2-391 dosed at 40 mg twice-daily lacks antitumor activity in men with CRPC, but has modest effects on bone turnover markers.

We have previously shown that treatment of androgen-sensitive LNCaP prostate cancer cells with a non-selective SK isoform inhibitor, 2-(p-hydroxyanilino)-4-(p-chlorophenyl)thiazole (SKi), induces the proteasomal degradation of SK1. This is concomitant with a significant increase in C22:0-ceramide and sphingosine levels and a reduction in S1P levels, resulting in the apoptosis of LNCaP cells. In contrast, we show here that a SK2-selective inhibitor, (R)-FTY720 methyl ether (ROME), increases sphingosine and decreases S1P levels but has no effect on ceramide levels and does not induce apoptosis in LNCaP cells. We also show that several glycolytic metabolites and (R)-S-lactoylglutathione are increased upon treatment of LNCaP cells with SKi, which induces the proteasomal degradation of c-Myc. These changes reflect an indirect antagonism of the Warburg effect. LNCaP cells also respond to SKi by diverting glucose 6-phosphate into the pentose phosphate pathway to provide NADPH, which serves as an antioxidant to counter an oxidative stress response. SKi also promotes the formation of a novel pro-apoptotic molecule called diadenosine 5',5'''-P(1),P(3)-triphosphate (Ap3A), which binds to the tumor suppressor fragile histidine triad protein (FHIT). In contrast, the SK2-selective inhibitor, ROME, induces a reduction in some glycolytic metabolites and does not affect oxidative stress. We conclude that SK1 functions to increase the stability of c-Myc and suppresses Ap3A formation, which might maintain the Warburg effect and cell survival, while SK2 exhibits a non-overlapping function.""","""['David G Watson', 'Francesca Tonelli', 'Manal Alossaimi', 'Leon Williamson', 'Edmond Chan', 'Irina Gorshkova', 'Evgeny Berdyshev', 'Robert Bittman', 'Nigel J Pyne', 'Susan Pyne']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Cell Signal""","""['The roles of sphingosine kinase 1 and 2 in regulating the metabolome and survival of prostate cancer cells.', 'The sphingosine kinase inhibitor 2-(p-hyroxyanilino)-4-(p-chlorophenyl)thiazole reduces androgen receptor expression via an oxidative stress-dependent mechanism.', 'Proteasomal degradation of sphingosine kinase 1 and inhibition of dihydroceramide desaturase by the sphingosine kinase inhibitors, SKi or ABC294640, induces growth arrest in androgen-independent LNCaP-AI prostate cancer cells.', 'Structure-function analysis of lipid substrates and inhibitors of sphingosine kinases.', 'Sphingosine kinase 1 in cancer.', '1-Deoxysphinganine initiates adaptive responses to serine and glycine starvation in cancer cells via proteolysis of sphingosine kinase.', 'Sphingosine Kinase 1 Signaling in Breast Cancer: A Potential Target to Tackle Breast Cancer Stem Cells.', 'How cancer cells remodel lipid metabolism: strategies targeting transcription factors.', 'The Tumorigenic Effect of Sphingosine Kinase 1 and Its Potential Therapeutic Target.', 'Lipids and cancer: Emerging roles in pathogenesis, diagnosis and therapeutic intervention.']"""

Because of the ability of these compounds to inhibit the activity of flavoprotein-containing epithelial NADPH oxidases, we chose to examine the effects of several iodonium-class flavoprotein inhibitors on human colon cancer cell lines that express high, functional levels of a single such oxidase (NADPH oxidase 1, or Nox1). We found that diphenyleneiodonium (DPI), di-2-thienyliodonium (DTI), and iodonium diphenyl inhibited the growth of Caco2, HT-29, and LS-174T colon cancer cells at concentrations (10-250nM for DPI, 0.5-2.5μM for DTI, and 155nM to 10μM for iodonium diphenyl) substantially lower than needed for DU145 human prostate cancer cells, which do not possess functional NADPH oxidase activity. Drug treatment was associated with decreased H2O2 production and diminished intracellular ROS levels, lasting up to 24h, after short-term (1-h) exposure to the iodonium analogs. Decreased tumor cell proliferation was caused, in part, by a profound block in cell cycle progression at the G1/S interface in both LS-174T and HT-29 cells exposed to either DPI or DTI; and the G1 block was produced, for LS-174T cells, by upregulation of p27 and a drug concentration-related decrease in the expression of cyclins D1, A, and E that was partially prevented by exogenous H2O2. Not only did DPI and DTI decrease intracellular ROS, they both also significantly decreased the mRNA expression levels of Nox1, potentially contributing to the prolonged reduction in tumor cell reactive oxygen levels. We also found that DPI and DTI significantly decreased the growth of both HT-29 and LS-174T human tumor xenografts, at dose levels that produced peak plasma concentrations similar to those utilized for our in vitro experiments. These findings suggest that iodonium analogs have therapeutic potential for NADPH oxidase-containing human colon cancers in vivo and that at least part of their antineoplastic mechanism of action may be related to targeting Nox1.""","""['James H Doroshow', 'Shikha Gaur', 'Susan Markel', 'Jiamo Lu', 'Josephus van Balgooy', 'Timothy W Synold', 'Bixin Xi', 'Xiwei Wu', 'Agnes Juhasz']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Free Radic Biol Med""","""['Antiproliferative mechanisms of action of the flavin dehydrogenase inhibitors diphenylene iodonium and di-2-thienyliodonium based on molecular profiling of the NCI-60 human tumor cell panel.', 'Characterization of potent and selective iodonium-class inhibitors of NADPH oxidases.', 'NADPH oxidase 1 supports proliferation of colon cancer cells by modulating reactive oxygen species-dependent signal transduction.', 'NADPH oxidases: a perspective on reactive oxygen species production in tumor biology.', 'Targeting NADPH oxidases for the treatment of cancer and inflammation.', 'Antioxidant Therapy in Cancer: Rationale and Progress.', 'Strategies for Improving Photodynamic Therapy Through Pharmacological Modulation of the Immediate Early Stress Response.', 'Inhibition of the HIF-1 Survival Pathway as a Strategy to Augment Photodynamic Therapy Efficacy.', 'Effects of Iodonium Analogs on Nadph Oxidase 1 in Human Colon Cancer Cells.', 'Reactive Oxygen Species in Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia: Reducing Radicals to Refine Responses.']"""

Although p53 and p63 have high sequence and structural similarities, the molecules differ in function and expression profiles. p63 is critical for the development of epithelial organs or tissues, including the epidermis and other squamous epithelia, as well as the salivary, lachrymal, mammary and prostate glands and the urothelium. In addition, p63 is essential for the proliferative potential of stem cells in the epidermis. In contrast to p53, the role of ΔNp63 in tumors remains unclear and complex. Our previous study demonstrated that ΔNp63 is overexpressed in human bladder carcinoma tissues. The mechanism by which ΔNp63 promotes tumor cell development, including adhesion, proliferation and polarity, is unknown. Data demonstrate that ΔNp63 induces the invasiveness of cancer cells through specific downstream genes and the mechanism is associated with cell junctions. Claudin‑1 is an important p63 target gene for normal skin development. Claudin‑1, as a connexin, functions in a similar manner to other connexins to affect important events during cancer cell development. In the present study, ΔNp63 gene expression in bladder tumor tissues was found to be significantly higher than that in normal tissue, indicating that ΔNp63 is localized to the nucleus.

The antibiotic coating significantly increased the cost of the device by an average of $1,300 per artificial urinary sphincter. To our knowledge, no clinical data to date support the theory that this antibiotic coating decreases the risk of artificial urinary sphincter infection. Therefore, we compared infection rates in our cases before and after the introduction of InhibiZone coated artificial urinary sphincters to determine whether the coating decreased the device infection rate.  Materials and methods:   We retrospectively reviewed the records of 426 consecutive patients in whom an artificial urinary sphincter was implanted by a single surgeon from January 2005 to June 2012. Patients were divided equally into 213 consecutive males who received an artificial urinary sphincter without the antibiotic coating from January 2005 to March 2008 and 213 consecutive males implanted with the antibiotic coated artificial urinary sphincter from April 2008 to June 2012. Demographics and infection rates were compared.  Results:   Patient mean age, associated comorbidities and complexity were almost identical in the groups with and without the antibiotic coating, and infection rates were identical at 7 patients (3.3%) per group (p = 0.99).

Materials and methods:   From December 2009 to November 2011, patients in 7 centers scheduled for a first prostate biopsy, with a prostate specific antigen less than 20 ng/ml and no nodule on digital rectal examination, were invited to participate in this superiority trial. Patients were randomized to a 12-core (PB12 group) or a 20-core (PB20 group) protocol. The primary end point was cancer detection rate. Secondary end points were cancer characteristics, rate of complications and patient tolerance assessed by a self-completed booklet before prostate biopsy and at day 5 and day 15.  Results:   A total of 339 patients were randomized. Preoperative variables were similar in both groups. Cancer was detected in 71 patients (42.0%) in PB12 group and in 81 patients (48.8%) in PB20 group, and the difference was not significant (p >0.2). Gleason score and cancer length measured on prostate biopsy cores were not significantly different between groups. Although the cancer detection rate was linked to prostate volume, this was not affected by the number of extracted cores (p >0.4). Complications number and seriousness were comparable in both arms. No significant difference was noted regarding side effects and tolerance as self-assessed by the patient at day 5 and day 15 after prostate biopsy.

Luminal cells have long been considered the cellular origin of prostate cancer (CaP). However, recent evidence from a prostate regeneration assay suggests that prostate basal cells can also give rise to CaP. Here, we characterize Pten-deficient prostate lesions arising from keratin 5-expressing basal cells in a temporally controlled system in mice. Pten-deficient prostate lesions arising from basal cells exhibited luminal phenotypes with higher invasiveness, and the cell fate of Pten-deficient basal cells was traced to neoplastic luminal cells. After temporally ablating Pten in keratin 8-expressing luminal cells, luminal-derived Pten-deficient prostate tumors exhibited slower disease progression, compared with basal-derived tumors, within 13 weeks after Pten ablation. Cellular proliferation was significantly increased in basal-derived versus luminal-derived Pten-deficient prostate lesions. Increased tumor invasion into the smooth muscle layer and aberrantly regulated aggressive signatures (Smad4 and Spp1) were identified exclusively in basal-derived Pten-deficient lesions. Interestingly, p63-expressing cells, which represent basal stem and progenitor cells of basal-derived Pten-deficient prostate lesions, were significantly increased, relative to cells of the luminal-derived prostate lesion. Furthermore, castration did not suppress cellular proliferation of either basal-derived or luminal-derived Pten-deficient prostate tumors. Taken together, our data suggest that, although prostate malignancy can originate from both basal and luminal populations, these two populations differ in aggressive potential.""","""['Tsai-Ling Lu', 'Yi-Fen Huang', 'Li-Ru You', 'Nai-Chen Chao', 'Fang-Yi Su', 'Junn-Liang Chang', 'Chun-Ming Chen']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Am J Pathol""","""['Differential requirements for β-catenin in murine prostate cancer originating from basal versus luminal cells.', 'TGFβ signaling limits lineage plasticity in prostate cancer.', 'A rare castration-resistant progenitor cell population is highly enriched in Pten-null prostate tumours.', 'Differentiation pathways and histogenetic aspects of normal and abnormal prostatic growth: a stem cell model.', 'Prostate-Specific G-Protein Coupled Receptor, an Emerging Biomarker Regulating Inflammation and Prostate Cancer Invasion.', 'Transcriptomic profiling of retinal cells reveals a subpopulation of microglia/macrophages expressing Rbpms marker of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) that confound identification of RGCs.', 'Basal epithelial cells in prostate development, tumorigenesis, and cancer progression.', 'Pten inhibition dedifferentiates long-distance axon-regenerating intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells and upregulates mitochondria-associated Dynlt1a and Lars2.', ""Nuclear PTEN's Functions in Suppressing Tumorigenesis: Implications for Rare Cancers."", 'Transcriptomic profiling of retinal cells reveals a subpopulation of microglia/macrophages expressing Rbpms and Spp1 markers of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) that confound identification of RGCs.']"""

Objective:   To examine whether prognostic models still accurately reflect survival in a large cohort of trial participants.  Design, setting, and participants:   Survival analysis of 442 men with CRPC sequentially treated in clinical trials at our institution from June 2003 to December 2011.  Outcome measures and statistical analysis:   Predicted survival by Halabi and Smaletz nomograms was compared to observed survival. Cox model multivariate analysis (MVA) used variables at referral, including performance status (PS); levels of prostate-specific antigen (PSA), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), haemoglobin (Hb), and albumin; presence of visceral disease, and metastatic disease at diagnosis.  Results and limitations:   From point of referral, chemotherapy-naïve patients had a median OS of 30.6 mo (95% confidence interval [CI], 27.6-36.5 mo). In contrast, predicted survival using the Halabi and Smaletz models was 21 and 18 mo, respectively. In these patients, poor PS, lower Hb level, and increasing LDH level were the strongest predictors in the MVA. In patients referred after chemotherapy, survival from referral was 17.5 mo (95% CI, 16.0-19.5 mo) and increasing LDH level and presence of visceral metastases were the strongest predictors of survival. Median OS from diagnosis of CRPC was 40.7 mo in the overall cohort (95% CI, 36.8-44.0 mo). Clinical trial participation was safe, with low mortality rate. This cohort of men participated in phase 1, 2 and 3 trials and expanded access programs; their data may not reflect survival in all CRPC patients.

The PSA-AV was developed using 1000 prostate biopsy specimens and was validated on 318 internal and 4406 external biopsy specimens.  Results:   We analyzed 1000 biopsy specimens (mean age 63 ± 8 years, 63% white and 35% black, mean PSA 6.8 ± 4 ng/mL, mean prostate volume 41 ± 18 cm(3), mean PSA-AV 485 ± 304). Of the 1000 biopsy specimens, 556 (55.6%) had positive findings. A lower PSA-AV score correlated with a greater cancer risk (R(2) = 0.91). A PSA-AV score of 700 had a sensitivity and specificity of 87% and 35%, respectively. These values matched or exceeded the sensitivity and specificity for age-adjusted PSA level and a PSA cutoff of 4 ng/mL. Compared with using the age-adjusted PSA level, using a score of 700 increased the number of biopsies by 64 and detected 62 more cancers. Using a PSA-AV cutoff of 700, rather than a PSA cutoff of 4 ng/mL, led to 16 fewer biopsies with 7 additional cancers detected. Our data were internally and externally validated.  Conclusion:   According to our data, a PSA-AV score has shown to be a useful formula for predicting positive biopsy findings.

Methods:   Treatment and survival by SES of all newly diagnosed patients with prostate cancer (1998-2008) from the population-based Eindhoven Cancer Registry (n = 11,086) were studied.  Results:   Younger patients (<75) with early stage disease, including prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-detected stage cT1c, with low SES underwent prostatectomy and brachytherapy less often (10%-16% lower prostatectomy rates in low SES and 0%-7% lower brachytherapy rates in low SES) compared to those with high SES, but underwent more external beam radiotherapy, hormonal therapy, and watchful waiting policy (6%-9%, 5%-7%, and 3%-7% more in low SES, respectively). This was partially related to the prevalence of comorbidity. The introduction of brachytherapy for localized disease occurred first in high SES patients and these socioeconomic differences were hardly affected by socioeconomic differences in the presence of comorbidities. Overall 10-year survival was superior in high SES patients compared to low SES (localized disease 67% vs 44%, advanced disease 29% vs 20%), and was related to treatment and comorbidity.

A targeted approach to lesions found on imaging may have an impact on the risk attribution given to a man.  Objective:   To evaluate whether, based on computer simulation, targeting of lesions during biopsy results in reclassification of cancer risk when compared with transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) guided biopsy.  Design, setting, and participants:   A total of 107 reconstructed three-dimensional models of whole-mount radical prostatectomy specimens were used for computer simulations. Systematic 12-core TRUS biopsy was compared with transperineal targeted biopsies using between one and five cores. All biopsy strategies incorporated operator and needle deflection error. A target was defined as any lesion ≥ 0.2 ml. A false-positive magnetic resonance imaging identification rate of 34% was applied.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Sensitivity was calculated for the detection of all cancer and clinically significant disease. Cases were designated as high risk based on achieving ≥ 6 mm cancer length and/or ≥ 50% positive cores. Statistical significance (p values) was calculated using both a paired Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and the t test.  Results and limitations:   When applying a widely used biopsy criteria to designate risk, 12-core TRUS biopsy classified only 24% (20 of 85) of clinically significant cases as high risk, compared with 74% (63 of 85) of cases using 4 targeted cores. The targeted strategy reported a significantly higher proportion of positive cores (44% vs 11%; p<0.0001) and a significantly greater mean maximum cancer core length (7.8mm vs 4.3mm; p<0.0001) when compared with 12-core TRUS biopsy. Computer simulations may not reflect the sources of errors encountered in clinical practice. To mitigate this we incorporated all known major sources of error to maximise clinical relevance.  Conclusions:   Image-targeted biopsy results in an increase in risk attribution if traditional criteria, based on cancer core length and the proportion of positive cores, are applied.

Herein we evaluate the tolerability and non-oncologic outcomes of a highly select cohort of men that underwent focal cryoablation of the prostate for the treatment of localized prostate cancer.  Methods:   Pre-operatively, erectile function was assessed by SHIM questionnaire while voiding symptoms were assessed by AUA symptom score. Twenty-six highly select patients (23 low-risk prostate cancer and 3 intermediate-risk prostate cancer) with documented minimal disease on saturation prostate biopsy underwent focal cryoablation of the prostate (24 hemi-ablation and 2 subtotal ablation). Subsequently, serum PSAs were obtained every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months thereafter. PSA failure was defined as an increase of 0.50 ng/ml over nadir. Mean follow-up was 19.1 months. Subjective assessment of erectile function and voiding was assessed post-operatively at each visit.  Results:   Based on our PSA failure definition, 11.5% (3 patients) of the cohort experienced biochemical failure. In two of the three patients, localized disease was detected on subsequent transrectal ultrasound guided biopsy. These two patients went on to have favorable PSA nadirs after undergoing conventional definitive therapy (one patient had external beam radiation and one patient had whole gland cryoablation). Within the study cohort, 27% (7 patients) reported new post-operative erectile dysfunction requiring therapy while no patients reported new post-operative urinary incontinence or worsening of voiding symptoms.  Conclusion:   These preliminary results add to the expanding body of literature that the minimally invasive focal cryosurgical ablation of the prostate is a safe procedure with few side effects. The true extent of cancer control remains in question, but in highly select patients, favorable PSA kinetics have been demonstrated. If confirmed by further studies with long-term follow-up, this treatment approach could have a profound effect on prostate cancer management.""","""['Zachary Hale', 'Makito Miyake', 'Diego Aguilar Palacios', 'Charles J Rosser']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""BMC Urol""","""['Commentary on: ""Focal cryosurgical ablation of the prostate: a single institute\'s perspective"".', 'Single center experience with third-generation cryosurgery for management of organ-confined prostate cancer: critical evaluation of short-term outcomes, complications, and patient quality of life.', 'Cryosurgical ablation of prostate cancer: patterns of cancer recurrence.', 'Focal prostate cryoablation: initial results show cancer control and potency preservation.', 'Cryosurgical ablation as primary treatment in prostate cancer patients.', 'EAU guidelines on prostate cancer.

A novel POK family transcription factor, BTB/POZ and zinc finger domains factor on chromosome 1 (BOZF-1; also called ZBTB8A), contains a POZ domain and two C2H2-type Krüppel-like zinc fingers and is localized at nuclear speckles. Compared with paired normal tissues, BOZF1 expression is increased in cancer tissues of the prostate, breast, and cervix. BOZF1 repressed the transcription of p21WAF/CDKN1A by acting on the proximal promoter concentrated with Sp1-binding GC boxes. BOZF1 competed with Sp1 in binding to GC boxes 1-5/6 of the CDKN1A proximal promoter. In addition, BOZF1 interacted with p53 and decreased the acetylation of p53 by p300, which reduced the DNA binding activity of p53 at the far distal p53-binding element. BOZF1 blocked the two major molecular events that are important in both constitutive and inducible transcription activation of CDKN1A. BOZF1 is unique in that it bound to all the proximal GC boxes to repress transcription, and it inhibited p53 acetylation without affecting p53 stability.

GPCRs signal through heterotrimeric G proteins, and among the different types of G proteins, GNA12/13 have been most closely linked to tumor progression. In this study, we explored the role of GNA13 in prostate cancer cell invasion and the mechanism of up-regulation of GNA13 in these cells. An initial screen for GNA13 protein expression showed that GNA13 is highly expressed in the most aggressive cancer cell lines. Knockdown of GNA13 in highly invasive PC3 cells revealed that these cells depend on GNA13 expression for their invasion, migration, and Rho activation. As mRNA levels in these cells did not correlate with protein levels, we assessed the potential involvement of micro-RNAs (miRNAs) in post-transcriptional control of GNA13 expression. Expression analysis of miRNAs predicted to bind the 3'-UTR of GNA13 revealed that miR-182 and miR-141/200a showed an inverse correlation to the protein expression in LnCAP and PC3 cells. Ectopic expression of miR-182 and miR-141/200a in PC3 cells significantly reduced protein levels, GNA13-3'-UTR reporter activity and in vitro invasion of these cells. This effect was blocked by restoration of GNA13 expression in these cells. Importantly, inhibition of miR-182 and miR-141/200a in LnCAP cells using specific miRNA inhibitors elevated the expression of GNA13 and enhanced invasion of these cells. These data provide strong evidence that GNA13 is an important mediator of prostate cancer cell invasion, and that miR-182 and miR-200 family members regulate its expression post-transcriptionally.""","""['Suhail Ahmed Kabeer Rasheed', 'Cui Rong Teo', 'Emmanuel Jean Beillard', 'P Mathijs Voorhoeve', 'Patrick J Casey']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Biol Chem""","""['The emerging roles of Gα12/13 proteins on the hallmarks of cancer in solid tumors.', 'MicroRNA-31 controls G protein alpha-13 (GNA13) expression and cell invasion in breast cancer cells.', 'Gα-13 induces CXC motif chemokine ligand 5 expression in prostate cancer cells by transactivating NF-κB.', 'The GNA13-RhoA signaling axis suppresses expression of tumor protective Kallikreins.', 'The microRNA-200 family: small molecules with novel roles in cancer development, progression and therapy.', 'Effects of RFRP‑3 on an ovariectomized estrogen‑primed rat model and HEC‑1A human endometrial carcinoma cells.', 'Gα12 and Gα13: Versatility in Physiology and Pathology.', 'miR-182 targeting reprograms tumor-associated macrophages and limits breast cancer progression.', 'MitomiRs: their roles in mitochondria and importance in cancer cell metabolism.', 'The emerging roles of Gα12/13 proteins on the hallmarks of cancer in solid tumors.']"""

Our previous work showed that immunohistochemical (IHC) Ki-67 improved prediction of prostate cancer death in a cohort of conservatively treated clinically localised prostate cancers diagnosed by transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). Here, we present results in a more clinically relevant needle biopsy cohort.  Methods:   Biopsy specimens were microarrayed. The percentage of Ki-67 positively stained malignant cells per core was measured and the maximum score per individual used in analysis of time to death from prostate cancer using a Cox proportional hazards model.  Results:   In univariate analysis (n=293), the hazard ratio (HR) (95% confidence intervals) for dichotomous Ki-67 (≤ 10%, >10%) was 3.42 (1.76, 6.62) χ(2) (1 df)=9.8, P=0.002. In multivariate analysis, Ki-67 added significant predictive information to that provided by Gleason score and prostate-specific antigen (HR=2.78 (1.42, 5.46), χ(2) (1 df)=7.0, P=0.008).  Conclusion:   The IHC Ki-67 scoring on prostate needle biopsies is practicable and yielded significant prognostic information.

Data from 2,482 patients at 4 time points from T0 (initial diagnosis) to T3 (24 months follow-up) were analyzed.  Results:   T-tests and χ(2)-tests revealed no significant differences in terms of shared decision-making and information to different treatment options between patients aged over 75 years old and the rest of the sample.

Here we present profilin 1, a known tumor suppressor, as a target for cathepsin X carboxypeptidase activity in prostate cancer PC-3 cells. Profilin 1 co-localizes strongly with cathepsin X intracellularly in the perinuclear area as well as at the plasma membrane. Selective cleavage of C-terminal amino acids was demonstrated on a synthetic octapeptide representing the profilin C-terminal region, and on recombinant profilin 1. Further, intact profilin 1 binds its poly-L-proline ligand clathrin significantly better than it does the truncated one, as shown using cathepsin X specific inhibitor AMS-36 and immunoprecipitation of the profilin 1/clathrin complex. Moreover, the polymerization of actin, which depends also on the binding of poly-L-proline ligands to profilin 1, was promoted by AMS-36 treatment of cells and by siRNA cathepsin X silencing. Our results demonstrate that increased adhesion, migration and invasiveness of tumor cells depend on the inactivation of the tumor suppressive function of profilin 1 by cathepsin X.

The aberrant activity of stem cell pathways, and their regulation by the Androgen Receptor (AR), has the potential to provide insight into novel mechanisms and pathways to prevent and treat advanced, castrate-resistant prostate cancers. To this end, we investigated the role of the embryonic stem cell regulator Sox2 [SRY (sex determining region Y)-box 2] in normal and malignant prostate epithelial cells. In the normal prostate, Sox2 is expressed in a portion of basal epithelial cells. Prostate tumors were either Sox2-positive or Sox2-negative, with the percentage of Sox2-positive tumors increasing with Gleason Score and metastases. In the castration-resistant prostate cancer cell line CWR-R1, endogenous expression of Sox2 was repressed by AR signaling, and AR chromatin-IP shows that AR binds the enhancer element within the Sox2 promoter. Likewise, in normal prostate epithelial cells and human embryonic stem cells, increased AR signaling also decreases Sox2 expression. Resistance to the anti-androgen MDV3100 results in a marked increase in Sox2 expression within three prostate cancer cell lines, and in the castration-sensitive LAPC-4 prostate cancer cell line ectopic expression of Sox2 was sufficient to promote castration-resistant tumor formation. Loss of Sox2 expression in the castration-resistant CWR-R1 prostate cancer cell line inhibited cell growth. Up-regulation of Sox2 was not associated with increased CD133 expression but was associated with increased FGF5 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 5) expression. These data propose a model of elevated Sox2 expression due to loss of AR-mediated repression during castration, and consequent castration-resistance via mechanisms not involving induction of canonical embryonic stem cell pathways.""","""['Steven Kregel', 'Kyle J Kiriluk', 'Alex M Rosen', 'Yi Cai', 'Edwin E Reyes', 'Kristen B Otto', 'Westin Tom', 'Gladell P Paner', 'Russell Z Szmulewitz', 'Donald J Vander Griend']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['A novel antiandrogen, Compound 30, suppresses castration-resistant and MDV3100-resistant prostate cancer growth in vitro and in vivo.', 'Methylselenol prodrug enhances MDV3100 efficacy for treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'TACC2 is an androgen-responsive cell cycle regulator promoting androgen-mediated and castration-resistant growth of prostate cancer.', 'Oxidative stress and androgen receptor signaling in the development and progression of castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Androgen action in the prostate gland.', 'Basal epithelial cells in prostate development, tumorigenesis, and cancer progression.', 'State-of-the-art therapeutic strategies for targeting cancer stem cells in prostate cancer.', 'Role of transcription factors and chromatin modifiers in driving lineage reprogramming in treatment-induced neuroendocrine prostate cancer.', 'Reprogramming landscape highlighted by dynamic transcriptomes in therapy-induced neuroendocrine differentiation.', 'SOX8 Knockdown Overcomes Enzalutamide Resistance in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer by Inhibiting the Notch Signaling Pathway.']"""

The ability of the GnRH agonist leuprorelin acetate (LA) to induce a post-transcriptional upregulation of GnRH-R at the plasma membrane of androgen-sensitive (LNCaP) and -insensitive (PC-3) prostate cancer (PCa) cells has been previously demonstrated by Western blotting. Here we performed single molecule force spectroscopy by using Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), which has proven to be a powerful tool allowing for investigation of living cell surface biological features, such as the so far unclear GnRH agonist/receptor interaction. Thus, in the hormone-insensitive PC-3 cells, we characterized the strength of the LA-receptor binding, and the amount and distribution of the functional receptor molecules on the cell surface. The effect of a long and continuous treatment (up to 30 days) with the agonist (10(-11) and 10(-6) M) on the same parameters was also investigated. A GnRH-R increase was observed, reaching the maximum (∼80%) after 30 days of treatment with the highest dose of LA (10(-6) M). The analogue-induced increase in GnRH-R was also demonstrated by Western blotting. In addition, two different receptor bound strengths were detected by AFM, which suggests the existence of two GnRH-R classes. A homogeneous distribution of the unbinding events has been found on untreated and treated PC-3 cell surfaces. The persistence of high receptor levels at the membrane of these living cells may warrant the maintenance of the response to LA also in androgen-unresponsive PCa. Moreover, the determination of ligand/receptor bond strength could shed light on the poorly understood event of LA/GnRH-R interaction and/or address structural/chemical agonist optimizations.""","""['Gina Lama', 'Massimiliano Papi', 'Cristiana Angelucci', 'Giuseppe Maulucci', 'Gigliola Sica', 'Marco De Spirito']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['GnRH receptor expression in human prostate cancer cells is affected by hormones and growth factors.', 'Apoptosis-related gene expression affected by a GnRH analogue without induction of programmed cell death in LNCaP cells.', 'Pharmacoperone IN3 enhances the apoptotic effect of leuprolide in prostate cancer cells by increasing the gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor in the cell membrane.', 'Six-month leuprorelin acetate depot formulations in advanced prostate cancer: a clinical evaluation.', 'Leuprolide acetate: a drug of diverse clinical applications.', 'Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists sensitize, and resensitize, prostate cancer cells to docetaxel in a p53-dependent manner.']"""

Methods:   A total of 379 men with prostate cancer were referred to the National Center for Radiotherapy, Ghana from 2003 to 2009. Data were collected regarding patient-and tumor-related factors such as age, prostate specific antigen (PSA), Gleason score (GS), clinical stage (T), and use of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). For patients who received EBRT, freedom from biochemical failure (FFbF) was evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier method.  Results:   Of 379 patients referred for treatment 69.6% had initial PSA (iPSA) > 20 ng/ml, and median iPSA was 39.0 ng/ml. A total of 128 men, representing 33.8% of the overall cohort, were diagnosed with metastatic disease at time of referral.

Identification of genes that are differentially expressed or associated with clinical outcomes invokes the multiple testing problem. False Discovery Rate (FDR) control is a statistical method used to correct for multiple comparisons for independent or weakly dependent test statistics. Although FDR control is frequently applied to microarray data analysis, gene expression is usually correlated, which might lead to inaccurate estimates. In this paper, we evaluate the accuracy of FDR estimation.  Methods:   Using two real data sets, we resampled subgroups of patients and recalculated statistics of interest to illustrate the imprecision of FDR estimation. Next, we generated many simulated data sets with block correlation structures and realistic noise parameters, using the Ultimate Microarray Prediction, Inference, and Reality Engine (UMPIRE) R package. We estimated FDR using a beta-uniform mixture (BUM) model, and examined the variation in FDR estimation.  Results:   The three major sources of variation in FDR estimation are the sample size, correlations among genes, and the true proportion of differentially expressed genes (DEGs). The sample size and proportion of DEGs affect both magnitude and precision of FDR estimation, while the correlation structure mainly affects the variation of the estimated parameters.

Prostatic tissue was collected from patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia or prostate cancer by transurethral resection of the prostate. The expression and cellular localization of the AQPs were determined in the human prostate by Western blot and immunohistochemistry. AQP1, 3, and 9 were expressed in the human prostate. Western blot analysis revealed bands at 28-36 kDa for the AQP1, 3, and 9 proteins. Of these proteins, AQP3 and 9 were expressed in the epithelium. Immunolabeling showed that AQP1 was mainly expressed in the capillaries and venules of the prostate, AQP9 was expressed in the cytoplasm of the epithelium, and AQP3 was mainly associated with the plasma membrane of the prostatic epithelium. Only AQP3 expression was localized in the cell membrane, and expressed AQP3 was translocated to the cytoplasm in prostate cancer.

Clinical end points were recurrence-free survival (RFS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS), respectively. The ANPEP promoter methylation levels were determined by bisulphite sequencing or MethyLight analysis in 278 nonmalignant and PC tissue samples, and in cell lines.  Results:   The APN expression was significantly downregulated in PC compared with nonmalignant prostate tissue samples. Aberrant promoter hypermethylation was frequently observed in PC tissue samples, and 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine induced ANPEP expression in three hypermethylated prostate cell lines, suggesting epigenetic silencing. Negative APN immunoreactivity was significantly associated with short RFS and short CSS in the RP and CT cohort, respectively, independently of routine clinicopathological predictors. Combining APN with a known angiogenesis marker (vascular endothelial growth factor or microvessel density) improved risk prediction significantly in both cohorts.

Application of these discoveries to the surgical technique made it possible to preserve sexual function, reduce urinary continence to a minimum, and perform the procedure in a relative bloodless field.

The mechanism for ERK5 activation in CaP remains to be fully elucidated. Studies have recently implicated the role of microRNA (miRNA) mir143 expression in the regulation of ERK5 expression.  Methods:   We utilised a tissue microarray (TMA) of 530 CaP cores from 168 individual patients and stained for both mir143 and ERK5. These TMAs were scored by a combination of observer and automated methods.  Results:   We observed a strong inverse relation between ERK5 and mir143, which manifested itself most strongly in the subgroup of 417 cores with non-zero mir143 and ERK5 immunoreactivity, or with only one of mir143 or ERK5 being zero (cc=0.2558 and P<0.0001). Mir143 neither correlate with Gleason scores or prostate-specific antigen levels, nor was it a predictor of disease-specific survival on univariate analysis.  Conclusion:   Although the mechanism for ERK5 activation in CaP remains to be fully elucidated, we have further validated the potential role of mir143 in regulating ERK5 levels in the clinical context.

The aim of the current study is to establish if AR phosphorylation by Cdk1 or ERK1/2 is of prognostic significance.  Methods:   Scansite 2.0 was utilised to predict which AR sites are phosphorylated by Cdk1 and ERK1/2. Immunohistochemistry for these sites was then performed on 90 hormone-naive prostate cancer specimens. The interaction between Cdk1/ERK1/2 and AR phosphorylation was investigated in vitro using LNCaP cells.  Results:   Phosphorylation of AR at serine 515 (pAR(S515)) and PSA at diagnosis were independently associated with decreased time to biochemical relapse. Cdk1 and pCdk1(161), but not ERK1/2, correlated with pAR(S515). High expression of pAR(S515) in patients with a PSA at diagnosis of ≤20 ng ml(-1) was associated with shorter time to biochemical relapse (P=0.019).

Radioresistance may be due to tumor-hypoxia but also due to the PTEN mutation/deletion present in 70% prostate cancers. We investigated whether the novel PI3K/mTOR inhibitor BEZ235 might sensitize prostate cancer cells to radiation and reduce hypoxia-induced radioresistance.  Materials and methods:   The potential radiosensitizing properties of BEZ235 were investigated in vitro and in vivo using two prostate cancer cell lines, PC3 (PTEN(-/-)) and DU145 (PTEN(+/+)), under normoxic (21% O(2)) and hypoxic (0.5% O(2)) conditions.  Results:   BEZ235 rapidly inhibited PI3K and mTOR signaling in a dose dependent manner and limited tumor cell proliferation and clonogenic survival in both cell lines independently of PTEN status. In vivo, BEZ235 pretreatment enhanced the efficacy of radiation therapy on PC3 xenograft tumors in mice without inducing intestinal radiotoxicity. In culture, BEZ235 radiosensitized both cell lines in a comparable manner. Moreover, BEZ235 inhibited PI3K/mTOR activation and radiosensitized both cell lines under normoxia and hypoxia. BEZ235 radiosensitizing effects correlated with a decrease in γH2AX foci repair and increased G2/M cell cycle arrest.

The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between CXCR4 expression, TMPRSS2-ERG fusion and Gleason grade in prostate cancer. TMPRSS2-ERG rearrangement was investigated by FISH (n=44), ERG protein by IHC (n=84), and CXCR4 by quantitative RT-PCR (n=44). TMPRSS2-ERG rearrangement and ERG protein expression were present in almost 50% of the cases, without statistical differences between the different Gleason score groups. There was a very high concordance between FISH and IHC techniques (Kappa Index=0.954). Seventy percent of Gleason ⩾ 8 prostate tumors overexpressed CXCR4 mRNA, and the difference in CXCR4 expression with Gleason < 8 cases was statistically significant (p=0.009).

In this study cancer incidence and mortality rates for Serbia are presented using nation-wide data from two population-based cancer registries. These rates are additionally compared to European and global cancer epidemiology estimates. Finally, predictions on Serbian cancer incidence and mortality rates are provided.  Methods:   Cancer incidence and mortality was collected from the cancer registries of Central Serbia and Vojvodina from 1999 to 2009. Using age-specific regression models, we estimated time trends and predictions for cancer incidence and mortality for the following five years (2010-2014). The comparison of Serbian with European and global cancer incidence/mortality rates, adjusted to the world population (ASR-W) was performed using Serbian population-based data and estimates from GLOBOCAN 2008.  Results:   Increasing trends in both overall cancer incidence and mortality rates were identified for Serbia. In men, lung cancer showed the highest incidence (ASR-W 2009: 70.8/100,000), followed by colorectal (ASR-W 2009: 39.9/100,000), prostate (ASR-W 2009: 29.1/100,000) and bladder cancer (ASR-W 2009: 16.2/100,000). Breast cancer was the most common form of cancer in women (ASR-W 2009: 70.8/100,000) followed by cervical (ASR-W 2009: 25.5/100,000), colorectal (ASR-W 2009: 21.1/100,000) and lung cancer (ASR-W 2009: 19.4/100,000). Prostate and colorectal cancers have been significantly increasing over the last years in men, while this was also observed for breast cancer incidence and lung cancer mortality in women. In 2008 Serbia had the highest mortality rate from breast cancer (ASR-W 2008: 22.7/100,000), among all European countries while incidence and mortality of cervical, lung and colorectal cancer were well above European estimates.  Conclusion:   Cancer incidence and mortality in Serbia has been generally increasing over the past years. For a number of cancer sites, incidence and mortality is alarmingly higher than in the majority of European regions. For this increasing trend to be controlled, the management of risk factors that are present among the Serbian population is necessary.

AND WHAT DOES THE STUDY ADD?: Active surveillance has been widely accepted as a treatment tool for low-risk prostate cancer, and use of the Prostate Cancer Research International: Active Surveillance (PRIAS) criteria can select smaller and less aggressive tumours in low-risk disease. The study shows the pathological outcomes of radical prostatectomy for patients with low-risk disease who met the PRIAS criteria. It found that ~20% had unfavourable pathological features and only 30% satisfied insignificant cancer criteria with pT2 stage, a Gleason score ≤6 and tumour volume <2.5 mL. It concludes that close follow-up including repeat biopsy or MRI is necessary to minimize unexpected progression of disease.  Objective:   To assess the effectiveness of the Prostate Cancer Research International Active Surveillance (PRIAS) criteria in identifying indolent cancer.  Patients and methods:   Data from 1268 patients undergoing radical prostatectomy without neoadjuvant therapy were retrospectively reviewed. Within this cohort, patients with low-risk disease (n = 211) were classified according to whether they met (Group A, n = 87) or did not meet (Group B, n = 124) the PRIAS criteria. Pathological upstaging, upgrading, tumour volume and 5-year prostate-specific antigen (PSA) recurrence-free survival were compared between the two groups, and factors that predicted upstaging, upgrading and PSA recurrence were analysed by univariate and multivariate methods.  Results:   Pathological T3 stage was present in 10.3% of patients in Group A and in 18.5% of patients in Group B (P = 0.08). Gleason score upgrading to 4+3 or greater was seen in 19.5% of Group A and in 29.9% of Group B (P = 0.01). The mean (range) tumour volume was 0.81 (0.03-5.09) mL in Group A and 1.40 (0.04-8.21) mL in Group B (P < 0.01). The rates of insignificant cancer with total tumour volume <2.5 mL, Gleason score ≤6 and stage pT2 were 30.6% in Group A and 15.4% in Group B (P = 0.07). With a median follow-up of 44 months, the 5-year PSA recurrence-free survival rates were 91.2% in Group A and 86.4% in Group B (P = 0.47). In multivariate analysis, PSA density and the PRIAS criteria were independent factors that predicted upstaging.  Conclusions:   Although use of the PRIAS criteria could select more favourable tumours even in low-risk prostate cancer, about one in five men had unfavourable pathological outcomes and only three in ten had insignificant cancer.

Materials and methods:   A retrospective cohort of 219,388 community-dwelling men, aged ≥45 years, enrolled in the Kaiser Permanente Southern California health plan, with no history of prostate cancer and at least three PSA measurements, were followed from 1 January 1998 to 31 December 2007, for the development of biopsy-confirmed prostate cancer. Annual percent changes in total serum PSA levels were estimated using linear mixed models. The accuracy of prostate cancer prediction was assessed for prostate cancer overall and for aggressive disease (Gleason score ≥7) and compared with that of a single measure of PSA level using area under the receiver-operating characteristic curves (AUCs).  Results:   The men in this cohort experienced a mean change of 2.9% in PSA levels per year and the rate of change in PSA increased modestly with age (P ≤ 0.001). Annual percent changes in PSA accurately predicted the presence of prostate cancer (AUC = 0.963) and aggressive disease (AUC = 0.955) and had more predictive accuracy for aggressive disease than did a single measurement of PSA alone (AUC = 0.727).

This is the first study to date, which has investigated the potential prognostic role of SNP profiles in an AS cohort  Patients and methods:   FH data were collected from patients in the Royal Marsden Hospital AS study. In all, 39 prostate cancer-risk SNPs identified from published genome wide association studies (GWAS) were genotyped using the Sequenom Platform and TaqMan™ assays from available DNA. The cumulative genetic-risk scores for each patient were then calculated using the weighted effect estimated from previous GWAS (log-additive model). FH status and the genetic-risk scores were assessed against adverse outcomes in AS, time to treatment and adverse histology on repeat biopsy, using univariable and multivariable Cox regression models to address time to treatment; and binary logistic regression to address biopsy upgrade.  Results:   Of 471 patients, 55 (13.6%) had adverse histology on repeat biopsies and 145 (30.8%) had deferred treatment. On univariate analysis, there was no significant relationship between FH of prostate cancer in any degree of relation, and adverse histology or time to treatment. For risk score analyses, 386 patients' DNA was studied; and there was also no relationship found between the calculated genetic risk scores and adverse histology or time to treatment (P = 0.573 and P = 0.965, respectively).

Prostate CSCs/CICs were isolated as ALDH1(high) cells using the ALDEFLUOR assay, and the gene expression profiles were analyzed using a cDNA microarray and RT-PCR. We found that prostate CSCs/CICs expressed higher levels of growth factors including hepatocyte growth factor (HGF).

On the other hand, c-MET HGF receptor was expressed in both CSCs/CICs and non-CSCs/CICs at similar levels. Hepatocyte growth factor and the supernatant of myofibloblasts derived from the prostate augmented prostasphere formation in vitro, and prostasphere formation was inhibited by an anti-HGF antibody. Furthermore, c-MET gene knockdown by siRNA inhibited the prostasphere-forming ability in vitro and tumor-initiating ability in vivo.

The frequency of MPMN is being increasing. In this study we aimed to determine the frequency and clinical features of second primary cancers (SPCs).  Methods:   From January 1990 to December 2010, patients with MPMNs were screened in 5 centers. Data were obtained retrospectively from hospital charts.  Results:   Three hundred seventy-seven patients with MPMNs were evaluated. The median age at initial cancer diagnosis was 61 years (range 18-88). The median age at second cancer was 64 years (range 20-89). The median time between two cancer diagnoses was 15 months (range 0-504). Male to female ratio was 1.44 (M/F 223/154). The most frequent initial cancer types were head and neck (54 patients, 14.3%), breast (54 patients, 14.3%), and colorectal (43 patients, 11.4%). The most frequent second cancer types were lung (76 patients, 20.2%), colorectal (39 patients, 10.3%) and breast (33 patients, 8.8%). The most common cancer pairs in females were breast-gynecologic cancers (15 patients, 9.7%), colorectal-breast cancers (9 patients, 5.8%) and breast-colorectal cancers (7 patients, 4.5%).

Here, we evaluate the biologic activity of a less calcemic vitamin D analog 1α-hydroxyvitamin D2 [1α-OH-D2] (Bone Care International, Inc.) in patients with prostate cancer and high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HG PIN).  Methods:   Patients with clinically organ-confined prostate cancer and HG PIN were randomized to 1α-OH-D2 versus placebo for 28 days prior to radical prostatectomy. Intermediate endpoint biomarkers included serum vitamin D metabolites, TGFß 1/2, free/total PSA, IGF-1, IGFBP-3, bFGF, and VEGF. Tissue endpoints included histology, MIB-1 and TUNEL staining, microvessel density and factor VIII staining, androgen receptor and PSA, vitamin D receptor expression and nuclear morphometry.  Results:   The 1α-OH-D2 vitamin D analog was well tolerated and could be safely administered with good compliance and no evidence of hypercalcemia over 28 days. While serum vitamin D metabolite levels only slightly increased, evidence of biologic activity was observed with significant reductions in serum PTH levels. TGF-ß2 was the only biomarker significantly altered by vitamin D supplementation. Whether reduced TGF-ß2 levels in our study is an early indicator of response to vitamin D remains unclear.

During the most recent 5 years for which there are data (2005-2009), delay-adjusted cancer incidence rates declined slightly in men (by 0.6% per year) and were stable in women, while cancer death rates decreased by 1.8% per year in men and by 1.5% per year in women. Overall, cancer death rates have declined 20% from their peak in 1991 (215.1 per 100,000 population) to 2009 (173.1 per 100,000 population). Death rates continue to decline for all 4 major cancer sites (lung, colorectum, breast, and prostate). Over the past 10 years of data (2000-2009), the largest annual declines in death rates were for chronic myeloid leukemia (8.4%), cancers of the stomach (3.1%) and colorectum (3.0%), and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (3.0%). The reduction in overall cancer death rates since 1990 in men and 1991 in women translates to the avoidance of approximately 1.18 million deaths from cancer, with 152,900 of these deaths averted in 2009 alone.

The addition of oil/fat, as in deep-frying, may be of particular concern, and has not specifically been investigated in relation to PCa. Potential mechanisms include the formation of potentially carcinogenic agents such as aldehydes, acrolein, heterocyclic amines, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and acrylamide.  Methods:   We estimated odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the association between tertiles of intake of deep-fried foods from a food frequency questionnaire (French fries, fried chicken, fried fish, doughnuts and snack chips) and PCa risk, adjusted for potential confounders, among 1,549 cases and 1,492 controls. We additionally examined associations with more aggressive PCa (defined as regional/distant stage, elevated Gleason score or prostate-specific antigen level).  Results:   Compared with <1/week, there was a positive association with PCa risk for intake ≥1/week of French fries (OR = 1.37; 95% CI, 1.11-1.69), fried chicken (OR = 1.30; 95% CI, 1.04-1.62), fried fish (OR = 1.32; 95% CI, 1.05-1.66), and doughnuts (OR = 1.35; 95% CI, 1.11-1.66).

Conclusion:   Regular consumption of select deep-fried foods is associated with increased PCa risk.

A limitation of previous studies is linked to the use of human PCa cell lines PC3 and DU145, producing CXCL8 at levels strongly exceeding CXCL1 levels. Moreover, in mouse models the sharing of CXCR2 receptor by both ligands makes the phenotype induced by CXCL8 and CXCL1 almost indistinguishable. To overcome this problem we used the murine TRAMP-C2 cell line, not expressing CXCL8 and expressing CXCL1 at low levels.  Methods:   The effect of CXCL1 overexpression was examined by in vivo subcutaneous tumor studies and in vitro functional assays of invasion and adhesion. Biochemical modifications were evaluated by Western blotting and antibody arrays.  Results:   Our data show that the overexpression of CXCL1 in TRAMP-C2 cells represses tumor establishment and in situ invasion. In vitro, the main action of CXCL1 expression in TRAMP cells is associated with the perturbation of molecules linked to cell adhesion and migration thus explaining in vivo data. Other in vitro findings also suggest that signaling by CXCL1 might activate a secretory network limiting in vivo tumor growth by reinforcing senescence. Immunohistochemical staining of human PCa, BPH, and normal prostate biopsies strengthen our observations on the mouse model: when expressed, CXCL1 is limited to small areas with faint staining and PCa progression does not rely on CXCL1 expression.  Conclusion:   We could speculate that CXCL1 overexpression acts as a suppressor of malignancy limiting the escape of tumor cells from the primary tumor and reinforcing growth arrest.""","""['Roberto Benelli', 'Sara Stigliani', 'Simona Minghelli', 'Sebastiano Carlone', 'Nicoletta Ferrari']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Involvement in Tumorigenesis and Clinical Significance of CXCL1 in Reproductive Cancers: Breast Cancer, Cervical Cancer, Endometrial Cancer, Ovarian Cancer and Prostate Cancer.', 'Broadening of transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate (TRAMP) model to represent late stage androgen depletion independent cancer.', 'Chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1 (CXCL1) protein expression is increased in high-grade prostate cancer.', 'CXCL1/GROα increases cell migration and invasion of prostate cancer by decreasing fibulin-1 expression through NF-κB/HDAC1 epigenetic regulation.', 'DU145 human prostate carcinoma invasiveness is modulated by urokinase receptor (uPAR) downstream of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling.', 'Involvement in Tumorigenesis and Clinical Significance of CXCL1 in Reproductive Cancers: Breast Cancer, Cervical Cancer, Endometrial Cancer, Ovarian Cancer and Prostate Cancer.', 'Identification of a distinct luminal subgroup diagnosing and stratifying early stage prostate cancer by tissue-based single-cell RNA sequencing.', 'Doxorubicin-Induced Cancer Cell Senescence Shows a Time Delay Effect and Is Inhibited by Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT).', 'Environmental Toxicant Induced Epigenetic Transgenerational Inheritance of Prostate Pathology and Stromal-Epithelial Cell Epigenome and Transcriptome Alterations: Ancestral Origins of Prostate Disease.', 'Epithelial-mesenchymal transition induced by GRO-α-CXCR2 promotes bladder cancer recurrence after intravesical chemotherapy.']"""

Numerous secreted proteins have been reported to promote osteoblastic or osteolytic bone responses. We determined whether previously identified and/or novel proteins were associated with the osteoblastic or osteolytic response in clinical specimens of PCa bone metastases.  Methods:   Gene expression was analyzed on 14 PCa metastases from 11 patients by microarray profiling and qRT-PCR, and protein expression was analyzed on 33 PCa metastases from 30 patients by immunohistochemistry on highly osteoblastic and highly osteolytic bone specimens.  Results:   Transcript and protein levels of BMP-2, BMP-7, DKK-1, ET-1, and Sclerostin were not significantly different between osteoblastic and osteolytic metastases. However, levels of OPG, PGK1, and Substance P proteins were increased in osteoblastic samples. In addition, Emu1, MMP-12, and sFRP-1 were proteins identified with a novel role of being associated with either the osteoblastic or osteolytic bone response.

We studied tumor characteristics, risk of biochemical recurrence and mortality after radical prostatectomy in 5-ARI and alpha-blocker users.  Methods:   The study cohort consisted of 1,315 men who underwent radical prostatectomy at the Tampere University Hospital during 1995-2009. Biochemical relapse was defined as serum PSA ≥ 0.2 ng/ml after the operation. Information on mortality and medication purchases was obtained from national registries. Cox proportional regression was used to analyze hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) of biochemical relapse and death.  Results:   The proportion of high-grade (Gleason 7-10) tumors was significantly elevated among men who had used 5-ARIs for 4 years or longer compared to the non-users (83.3% vs. 53.3%, respectively). Survival curves for biochemical relapse-free survival differed between long-term and short-term 5-ARI users, but the hazard ratio remained statistically non-significant. Risk of biochemical recurrence was elevated among alpha-blocker users (HR 1.68, 95% CI 1.37-2.06), but in sensitivity analyses this was evident only in men using alpha-blockers after prostatectomy. Mortality was not associated with medication usage.  Conclusions:   Long-term users of finasteride or dutasteride had more often high-grade prostate cancer. Our results suggest also worse progression-free survival. The association between risk of biochemical recurrence and post-operative alpha-blocker usage suggests that voiding or storage symptoms after prostatectomy may predict biochemical relapse.""","""['Teemu J Murtola', 'Paula M Kujala', 'Teuvo L J Tammela']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Dutasteride treatment over 2 years delays prostate-specific antigen progression in patients with biochemical failure after radical therapy for prostate cancer: results from the randomised, placebo-controlled Avodart After Radical Therapy for Prostate Cancer Study (ARTS).', 'Effect of treatment with 5-α reductase inhibitors on progression in monitored men with favourable-risk prostate cancer.', '5-alpha Reductase inhibitors in prostate cancer: from clinical trials to clinical practice.', 'Prostate cancer.

Methods:   One hundred patients who underwent radical prostatectomy at Virginia Mason in Seattle between 1991 and 1997 were identified. Recurrence was confirmed by tissue diagnosis or radiographic signs. PCSM was confirmed by death certificates. Thirty-three patients with metastases or PCSM were matched to patients without recurrence at a 1:2 ratio. Paraffin embedded tissue was stained with two anti-ERG monoclonal antibodies, EPR3864 and 9FY. Nuclear expression intensity was evaluated as present/absent, on a 4-point relative intensity scale, and as a composite score (0-300).  Results:   Mean follow-up was 10.26 years. The two antibodies were highly correlated (P < 0.0001). Patients with higher ERG expression intensity and composite scores were significantly more likely to develop biochemical relapse, metastases, and PCSM. Kaplan-Meier survival curve analysis for the composite score of ERG expression revealed a significant association between higher ERG expression (EPR3864) and shorter PCa-specific survival (P = 0.047).  Conclusions:   While the presence of ERG expression at the time of surgery was not predictive of earlier relapse or PCSM, the relative intensity and composite score for ERG expression was prognostic for the development of biochemical relapse, metastases, and PCSM. Quantitative ERG scoring may be useful to identify patients who would benefit from adjuvant treatment or closer follow-up, allowing more accurate individual patient treatment plans.""","""['E Sophie Spencer', 'Richard B Johnston', 'Ryan R Gordon', 'Jared M Lucas', 'Cigdem Himmetoglu Ussakli', 'Antonio Hurtado-Coll', 'Shiv Srivastava', 'Peter S Nelson', 'Christopher R Porter']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['ERG expression is associated with increased risk of biochemical relapse following radical prostatectomy in early onset prostate cancer.', 'The TMPRSS2:ERG rearrangement, ERG expression, and prostate cancer outcomes: a cohort study and meta-analysis.', 'ERG immunohistochemistry is not predictive for PSA recurrence, local recurrence or overall survival after radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer.', 'The prognostic and predictive value of TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion and ERG protein expression in prostate cancer biopsies.', 'The prognostic role of ERG immunopositivity in prostatic acinar adenocarcinoma: a study including 454 cases and review of the literature.', 'PACE4-altCT isoform of proprotein convertase PACE4 as tissue and plasmatic biomarker for prostate cancer.', 'Insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor affects the survival of primary prostate cancer patients depending on TMPRSS2-ERG status.', 'Concurrent nuclear ERG and MYC protein overexpression defines a subset of locally advanced prostate cancer: Potential opportunities for synergistic targeted therapeutics.', 'DNA alterations in the tumor genome and their associations with clinical outcome in prostate cancer.', 'ERG expression in prostate cancer: biological relevance and clinical implication.']"""

Several groups have proposed the benefit of FS although the studies differ widely in sampling methods and sites where FS were taken. This study aims to evaluate the usefulness and reliability of standard assessment of FS in multiple sites during radical prostatectomy.  Methods:   During open radical prostatectomy in all patients we sampled tissue from the urethral stump, the neurovascular bundles, the Denonvillier fascia and the bladder neck after removing the prostate. Where FS showed positive margins, further periprostatic tissue was resected from the prostatic bed until negative margins were achieved. The results of FS were compared with margin status of final pathology.  Results:   From 1998 to 2004 we performed FS during 250 consecutive open radical prostatectomies (104 nerve sparing procedures). 66 patients had positive FS (26.4%) and 53 patients had positive surgical margins at final pathology (21.2%). All patients with positive FS had negative margins when further tissue was resected in the prostatic bed. During nerve sparing procedures positive FS were found in 14 patients. In these cases the procedure was converted into standard prostatectomy by resecting the neurovascular bundles. Sensibility and specificity were both 90%. Positive and negative predictive values were respectively 72% and 97%.  Conclusions:   Standard assessment of FS in multiple sites during radical prostatectomy achieved sensibility and specificity as high as 90%. Although the resection of urethral stump and tissue close to the neurovascular bundles could compromise functional results, standard assessment of FS in multiple sites could help the surgeon to reduce the positive surgical margins, to monitor the oncological safety of a nerve sparing procedure and to improve the pathological staging.""","""['Francesco Varvello', 'Enrico Conti', 'Marco Camilli', 'Sergio Lacquaniti', 'Giuseppe Fasolis']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Urologia""","""['Intraoperative peripheral frozen sections do not significantly affect prognosis after nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer.', 'Intraoperative frozen section of the prostate decreases positive margin rate while ensuring nerve sparing procedure during radical prostatectomy.', 'Positive surgical margin during radical prostatectomy: overview of sampling methods for frozen sections and techniques for the secondary resection of the neurovascular bundles.', 'Utility of intraoperative frozen section analysis of surgical margins in region of neurovascular bundles at radical prostatectomy.', 'Frozen section evaluation of margins in radical prostatectomy specimens: a contemporary study and literature review.']"""

In this phase II study, we assessed the efficacy and safety of (177)Lu-EDTMP for bone pain palliation in patients with breast cancer and hormone refractory prostate cancer with bone metastases.  Methods:   Sixteen patients were enrolled in the trial and were subsequently divided into 2 groups, the low-dose group (1295 MBq) and the high dose group (2590 MBq) to determine differences in toxicities and response rates. Pain scores, Karnofsky indices, mobility scores, and requirement of analgesic administration were assessed at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 12 weeks after injection of (177)Lu-EDTMP. Toxicity was assessed by analyzing hemoglobin, leukocyte, and platelet counts.  Results:   An obvious reduction in the mean pain score was observed at 2 to 6 weeks after the administration of (177)Lu-EDTMP. The rate of complete responses in bone pain palliation was 55% in group 1 and 80% in group 2 at 6 weeks after treatment. Of the 5 patients who required additional analgesics, all were able to reduce or completely stop taking these medications by 4 weeks after therapy. Mean (SD) Karnofsky indices of 58.18 (9.82) (range, 50-70) and 56.00 (8.94) (range, 50-70) at baseline increased to 82.73 (9.05) (range, 60-90) at 6 weeks after (177)Lu-EDTMP treatment in group 1 and 85.00 (5.77) (range, 80-90) at 8 weeks after injection in group 2, respectively. Mobility scores decreased from 2.91 (1.04) (range, 1-4) and 2.80 (0.84) (range, 2-4) at baseline to 1.00 (0.67) (range, 0-2) and 0.50 (0.58) (range, 0-1) at 8 weeks after administration of (177)Lu-EDTMP in groups 1 and 2, respectively, primarily owing to improved mobility.

Here, we strategically incorporate a pathogen (i.e., flagellin)-derived, NF-κB-stimulating ""danger"" signal into the large stress protein or chaperone Grp170 (HYOU1/ORP150) that was previously shown to facilitate antigen crosspresentation. This engineered chimeric molecule (i.e., Flagrp170) is capable of transporting tumor antigens and concurrently inducing functional activation of dendritic cells (DC). Intratumoral administration of adenoviruses expressing Flagrp170 induces a superior antitumor response against B16 melanoma and its distant lung metastasis compared with unmodified Grp170 and flagellin. The enhanced tumor destruction is accompanied with significantly increased tumor infiltration by CD8(+) cells as well as elevation of IFN-γ and interleukin (IL)-12 levels in the tumor sites. In situ Ad.Flagrp170 therapy provokes systemic activation of CTLs that recognize several antigens naturally expressing in melanoma (e.g., gp100/PMEL and TRP2/DCT). The mechanistic studies using CD11c-DTR transgenic mice and Batf3-deficient mice reveal that CD8α(+) DCs are required for the improved T-cell crosspriming. Antibody neutralization assays show that IL-12 and IFN-γ are essential for the Flagrp170-elicited antitumor response, which also involves CD8(+) T cells and natural killer cells. The therapeutic efficacy of Flagrp170 and its immunostimulating activity are also confirmed in mouse prostate cancer and colon carcinoma. Together, targeting the tumor microenvironment with this chimeric chaperone is highly effective in mobilizing or restoring antitumor immunity, supporting the potential therapeutic use of this novel immunomodulator in the treatment of metastatic diseases.""","""['Xiaofei Yu', 'Chunqing Guo', 'Huanfa Yi', 'Jie Qian', 'Paul B Fisher', 'John R Subjeck', 'Xiang-Yang Wang']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Cancer Res""","""['Immunologically programming the tumor microenvironment induces the pattern recognition receptor NLRC4-dependent antitumor immunity.', 'Extracellular targeting of endoplasmic reticulum chaperone glucose-regulated protein 170 enhances tumor immunity to a poorly immunogenic melanoma.', 'Immunization with tumor-derived ER chaperone grp170 elicits tumor-specific CD8+ T-cell responses and reduces pulmonary metastatic disease.', 'Harnessing dendritic cells for innovative therapeutic cancer vaccines.', 'High molecular weight stress proteins: Identification, cloning and utilisation in cancer immunotherapy.', 'Recombinant human Hsp110-gp100 chaperone complex vaccine is nontoxic and induces response in advanced stage melanoma patients.', 'Short Review on Advances in Hydrogel-Based Drug Delivery Strategies for Cancer Immunotherapy.', 'Step-by-Step Immune Activation for Suicide Gene Therapy Reinforcement.', 'Dendritic cells in cancer immunology.', 'Bacteria-Based Cancer Immunotherapy.']"""

Moreover, we demonstrated that methylglyoxal cytotoxicity, potentiated by the silencing of its major scavenging enzyme Glyoxalase I, occurred via different apoptotic responses in LNCaP and PC3 cells that also showed a different susceptibility to this metabolite. Finally, we showed that the observed methylglyoxal apoptogenic role involved different molecular pathways, specifically mediated by methylglyoxal or methylglyoxal-derived argpyrimidine intracellular accumulation and NF-kB signaling-pathway. In particular, in LNCaP cells, methylglyoxal, through the accumulation of argpyrimidine, desensitized the key cell survival NF-kB signaling pathway, which was consistent with the modulation of NF-kB-regulated genes, triggering a mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. The results suggest that this physiological compound merits investigation as a potential chemo-preventive/-therapeutic agent, in differently aggressive prostate cancers.""","""['Cinzia Antognelli', 'Letizia Mezzasoma', 'Katia Fettucciari', 'Vincenzo Nicola Talesa']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Int J Biochem Cell Biol""","""['Role of glyoxalase I in the proliferation and apoptosis control of human LNCaP and PC3 prostate cancer cells.', 'Docosahexaenoic acid enhances the efficacy of docetaxel in prostate cancer cells by modulation of apoptosis: the role of genes associated with the NF-kappaB pathway.', 'Ethanolic extract of Brazilian green propolis sensitizes prostate cancer cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis.', 'Methylglyoxal-derived stress: An emerging biological factor involved in the onset and progression of cancer.', 'Cells producing their own nemesis: understanding methylglyoxal metabolism.', 'Studies of Glyoxalase 1-Linked Multidrug Resistance Reveal Glycolysis-Derived Reactive Metabolite, Methylglyoxal, Is a Common Contributor in Cancer Chemotherapy Targeting the Spliceosome.', 'Metastatic Prostate Cancer Cells Secrete Methylglyoxal-Derived MG-H1 to Reprogram Human Osteoblasts into a Dedifferentiated, Malignant-like Phenotype: A Possible Novel Player in Prostate Cancer Bone Metastases.', 'The Glyoxalase System in Age-Related Diseases: Nutritional Intervention as Anti-Ageing Strategy.', 'In Vitro Evaluation of the Toxicological Profile and Oxidative Stress of Relevant Diet-Related Advanced Glycation End Products and Related 1,2-Dicarbonyls.', 'Glyoxalase-1-Dependent Methylglyoxal Depletion Sustains PD-L1 Expression in Metastatic Prostate Cancer Cells: A Novel Mechanism in Cancer Immunosurveillance Escape and a Potential Novel Target to Overcome PD-L1 Blockade Resistance.']"""

Consequently, we here examined whether IFNα immobilized on nanoscale ferromagnetic R-Chitosan carriers is capable of inducing rapid and sustained activation of STAT1 signaling. We report the spontaneous formation of a stable nanoparticle-IFNα protein corona, which was exploited to generate IFNα-loaded spheres, obviating the need to specifically couple the cytokine to the nanoparticles (NPs). Notably, comprehensive experimental approaches ensure that formation of the IFNα NP-corona does not affect the biological activity of the cytokine, as STAT1 signaling was efficiently activated. Employing human prostate cancer and melanoma cell models, we found that the intensity and duration of STAT1 phosphorylation as well as the downstream activation of pathobiologically relevant genes were dose and particle dependent. In comparison with free IFNα, IFNα-loaded spheres resulted in a more sustained biologically relevant STAT1 activation, demonstrated also by conferring innate cellular immunity against vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) infection.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the possibility to delegate this control to radiation therapists.  Material and methods:   The files of 33 patients (including 13 with prostate cancer) treated from November 2010 to February 2011 on a Varian™ Clinac IX accelerator with an OBI™ system were evaluated. Radiation therapists made the daily kV/kV imaging. Radiation therapists made the online control by kV/kV for patient repositioning and radio-oncologists made the offline reviews; the results were compared and analysed (seven radiation therapists and seven radio-oncologists). For an isocentre displacement of 5mm, the radiation therapist had to call the radio-oncologist to make a medical decision (treatment or patient displacement). The difference of measures and the concordance of decisions between radiation therapists and radio-oncologists were calculated.  Results:   Five hundred and fifty-six measures were made for 33 treatments, including 226 measures for prostate cancer treatment. The difference of measures between radiation therapists and radio-oncologists was 3mm or less in 93.7% for all treatments and 96.2% for prostate cancer treatment. The concordance of decision between radiation therapists and radio-oncologists for measures up to 4mm was 97% (CI95±2%) vs. 57% (CI95±10%) for measures equal to or higher than 5mm (P<0.0001).  Conclusion:   Radiation therapists are able to do daily set up using kV/kV on the bony structures of patients with prostate cancer, with a risk of disagreement higher than 3mm less than 4%.

They received transperineal injection of the hydrogel and 3-5 days after injection the simulation scans. All patients received IMRT (78Gy delivered, 2 Gy per fraction). Space stability was evaluated by using MRI or CT. Gastrointestinal (GI) and genitourinary (GU) toxicity was assessed using RTOG/EORTC scoring system and proctoscopy after 12 months. The median follow up time was 12 months.  Results:   Hydrogel application was straight forward using brachytherapy equipment and techniques, with minimal patient discomfort. Six patients (12%) experienced acute GI Grade 2 toxicity, with no patients experiencing Grade 3 or 4 toxicity. In addition, no patients had early late GI toxicity ≥ Grade 2 after 12 months. The gel was stable during the course of radiotherapy and was not detectable in MRI after 9-12 months due to absorption in 42 of 43 patients.

Materials and methods:   Using the Breast and Prostate Cancer Data Quality and Patterns of Care Study II, patients with prostate cancer who were diagnosed in 2004 were identified. Registrars reviewed the medical records of randomly selected patients with incident prostate cancer (n = 1906). The patients' residential address was geocoded and linked to the census tract from the 2000 U.S. Census.

Methods and materials:   The study cohort comprised 5077 men with PC consecutively treated with curative intent between 1997 and 2006 at the Chicago Prostate Cancer Center. Cox and Fine and Gray's competing risks regression multivariable analyses were performed, assessing whether cardiovascular comorbidity impacted the risk of ACM and PC-specific mortality, respectively, adjusting for CAD risk factors (diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, or hypertension) and sequelae (congestive heart failure or myocardial infarction), age, year and type of treatment, and known PC prognostic factors.  Results:   When compared with men with no comorbidity there was a significantly increased risk of ACM in men with congestive heart failure or myocardial infarction (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR] 1.96, P<.001) and in men with diabetes mellitus (AHR 1.60, P=.03) and hypertension (AHR 1.25, P=.04). In contrast, men with hypercholesterolemia had a similar risk of ACM (AHR 0.68, P=.17) when compared with men with no comorbidity. Other factors associated with a significantly increased risk of ACM included age (AHR 1.09, P<.001), prostate-specific antigen level (AHR 1.25, P=.008), and Gleason score 8-10 disease (AHR 1.71, P=.003). Cardiovascular comorbidity did not impact the risk of PC-specific mortality.  Conclusions:   In addition to age and unfavorable PC prognostic factors, select CAD risk factors and sequelae are associated with an increased risk of ACM in men treated for PC. These comorbidity prognostic factors predict time courses of mortality from competing causes, which may be factored into the decision-making process when considering management options for PC in a given individual.""","""['Akash Nanda', 'Ming-Hui Chen', 'Brian J Moran', 'Michelle H Braccioforte', ""Anthony V D'Amico""]""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['In reply to Froehner et al.', 'Comorbidity and mortality after brachytherapy: in regard to Nanda et al.', 'Neoadjuvant hormonal therapy use and the risk of death in men with prostate cancer treated with brachytherapy who have no or at least a single risk factor for coronary artery disease.', 'Hormonal therapy use for prostate cancer and mortality in men with coronary artery disease-induced congestive heart failure or myocardial infarction.', 'Predictors of prostate cancer-specific mortality in elderly men with intermediate-risk prostate cancer treated with brachytherapy with or without external beam radiation therapy.', 'Management of localised prostate cancer: watchful waiting, surgery or radiation therapy, depending on the natural course, which is often relatively slow.', 'Coronary artery disease in women – how to prevent heart failure after myocardial infarction?.', 'Effect of Neoadjuvant Hormonal Therapy on the Postoperative Course for Patients Undergoing Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Prostate-specific antigen nadir concentration, hypertension and diabetes as risk factors for biochemical failure after permanent 125I seed brachytherapy for prostate cancer.', 'Determining chemotherapy tolerance in older patients with cancer.']"""

Methods and materials:   A method to estimate intrinsic radiosensitivity (α), fractionation sensitivity (α/β), repopulation doubling time, number of clonogens, and kick-off time for accelerated repopulation of prostate cancer has been developed. Based on the generalized linear-quadratic model and without assuming the isoeffective hypothesis, the potential applications of the method were investigated using the clinical outcome of biochemical relapse-free survival recently reviewed in the literature. The strengths and limitations of the method, regarding the fitted parameters and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), are also discussed.  Results:   Our best estimate of α/β is 2.96 Gy (95% CI 2.41-3.53 Gy). The corresponding α value is 0.16 Gy(-1) (95% CI 0.14-0.18 Gy(-1)), which is compatible with a realistic number of clonogens: 6.5 × 10(6) (95% CI 1.5 × 10(6)-2.1 × 10(7)). The estimated cell doubling time is 5.1 days (95% CI 4.2-7.2 days), very low if compared with that reported in the literature. This corresponds to the dose required to offset the repopulation occurring in 1 day of 0.52 Gy/d (95% CI 0.32-0.68 Gy/d). However, a long kick-off time of 31 days (95% CI 22-41 days) from the start of radiation therapy was found.  Conclusion:   The proposed analytic/graphic method has allowed the fitting of clinical data, providing a self-consistent set of radiobiological parameters for prostate cancer. With our analysis we confirm a low value for α/β with a correspondingly high value of intrinsic radiosensitivity, a realistic average number of clonogens, a long kick-off time for accelerated repopulation, and a surprisingly fast repopulation that suggests the involvement of subpopulations of specifically tumorigenic stem cells during continuing radiation therapy.""","""['Piernicola Pedicini', 'Lidia Strigari', 'Marcello Benassi']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['In regard to Pedicini et al.', 'Prostate cancer dose-response, fractionation sensitivity and repopulation parameters evaluation from 25 international radiotherapy outcome data sets.', 'Impact of tumor repopulation on radiotherapy planning.', 'Clinical radiobiology of head and neck cancer: the hypothesis of stem cell activation.', 'Clinical radiobiology of glioblastoma multiforme: estimation of tumor control probability from various radiotherapy fractionation schemes.', 'Meta-analysis of the alpha/beta ratio for prostate cancer in the presence of an overall time factor: bad news, good news, or no news?', 'Radiobiological Meta-Analysis of the Response of Prostate Cancer to Different Fractionations: Evaluation of the Linear-Quadratic Response at Large Doses and the Effect of Risk and ADT.', 'Phase II Study of ENZAlutamide Combined With Hypofractionated Radiation Therapy (ENZART) for Localized Intermediate Risk Prostate Cancer.', 'Heuristic estimation of the α/β ratio for a cohort of Mexican patients with prostate cancer treated with external radiotherapy techniques.', 'Whole Pelvic Radiotherapy With Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy Boost vs. Conventionally Fractionated Radiotherapy for Patients With High or Very High-Risk Prostate Cancer.', 'Prostate cancer dose-response, fractionation sensitivity and repopulation parameters evaluation from 25 international radiotherapy outcome data sets.']"""

Therefore, a more advanced localization method is warranted if the SVs are part of the target volume. The purpose of this study was to develop a hybrid registration technique for the localization of the prostate and SVs.  Methods and materials:   Twenty prostate patients implanted with 2 or 3 elongated fiducial markers had cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans acquired at every fraction. The first step of the hybrid registration was to localize the prostate by CBCT-to-planning-CT alignment of the fiducial markers, allowing both translations and rotations. Using this marker registration as a starting point, the SVs were registered based on gray values, allowing only rotations around the lateral axis. We analyzed the differential rotation between the prostate and SVs and compared the required SV margins for 3 correction strategies.  Results:   The SV registration had a precision of 2.7° (1 standard deviation) and was successful for 96% of the scans. Mean (M), systematic (Σ), and random (σ) differences between the orientation of the prostate and SV were M = -0.4°, Σ = 7.2°, and σ = 6.4°. Daily marker-based corrections required an SV margin of 11.4 mm (translations only) and 11.6 mm (translations + rotations). Rotation corrections of the SVs reduced the required margin to 8.2 mm.  Conclusions:   We found substantial differences between the orientation of the prostate and SVs. The hybrid registration technique can accurately detect these rotations during treatment.

This study evaluated the accuracy of endorectal coil magnetic resonance imaging (eMRI) results, combining the preoperative prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and the biopsy Gleason score to improve the diagnostic accuracy of prostate cancer (PCa) with organ-confined disease (OCD) or extracapsular extension (ECE)/seminal vesicle invasion (SVI).  Methods:   Between 2001 and 2007, 94 PCa patients received eMRI testing during presurgical evaluation and underwent radical prostatectomy. As a part of routine patient workup, serum PSA level and Gleason score after pathology examination were recorded. The eMRI images were used to help assess patient PCa staging status regarding OCD or ECE/SVI. These stage assessments as evaluated through the use of MRI were compared with the final specimen pathological stage after the patients underwent radical prostatectomy.  Results:   Of the total 94 patients in our study, 65 had stage pT2, 12 had stage pT3a, and 17 had stage pT3b PCa. In patients with clinical stage T2 PCa, the Gleason score significantly improved the discriminative ability of eMRI to successfully predict PCa at the OCD stage. Otherwise, in cases of clinical stage T3 PCa, accurate determination of PSA levels significantly improved eMRI predictive ability to assess ECE or SVI staging.  Conclusion:   In clinical stage T2 PCa patients, integrating the biopsy Gleason score improved the discriminative ability to assess OCD PCa staging.

AND WHAT DOES THE STUDY ADD?: Receipt of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) has been associated with an increased risk of skeletal-associated complications, such as a decrease in bone mineral density and an increase in fracture risk. Many men with pre-existing health conditions receive ADT as their primary treatment because they are considered to be inappropriate candidates for attempted curative treatments. However, several chronic health conditions, such as diabetes, rheumatoid disease and chronic liver disease, are strong predictors for osteoporosis and fractures. We undertook the present study aiming to quantify the impact of treating men with ADT who carry known risk factors for skeletal complications. Among these high-risk men, more than 58% develop at least one fracture after ADT within the 12 years of follow-up. Men who sustained a fracture within 48 months experienced an almost 40% higher risk of mortality than those who did not. Our findings suggest that treating men with a high fracture risk at baseline with long-term ADT may have serious adverse consequences.  Objective:   To quantify the impact of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in men with a high baseline risk of skeletal complications and evaluate the risk of mortality after a fracture.  Patients and methods:   We studied 75994 men, aged ≥ 66 years, with localized prostate cancer from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results-Medicare linked data. Cox proportional hazard models were employed to evaluate the risk.  Results:   Men with a high baseline risk of skeletal complications have a higher probability of receiving ADT than those with a low risk (52.1% vs 38.2%, P < 0.001). During the 12-year follow-up, more than 58% of men with a high risk and 38% of men with a low risk developed at least one fracture after ADT. The dose effect of ADT is stronger among men who received ADT only compared to those who received ADT with other treatments. In the high-risk group, the fracture rate increased by 19.9 per 1000 person-years (from 52.9 to 73.0 person-years) for men who did not receive ADT compared to those who received 18 or more doses of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist among men who received ADT only, and by 14.2 per 1000 person-years (from 45.2 to 59.4 person-years) among men who received ADT and other treatments.

This is the first report on PCA3 in a large cohort of Japanese men. The diagnostic value of the PCA3 score in Japanese men was similar to those reported in European and US men. The study concludes that a combination of PSA density and PCA3 score may be useful for selecting patients who could avoid an unnecessary biopsy.  Objective:   To examine the diagnostic performance of the prostate cancer gene 3 (PCA3) score for prostate cancer in Japanese men undergoing prostate biopsy.  Patients and methods:   This Japanese, multicentre study included 647 Asian men who underwent extended prostate biopsy with elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and/or abnormal digital rectal examination (DRE). Urine samples were collected after DRE. The PCA3 score was determined using a PROGENSA PCA3 assay and correlated with biopsy outcome. Its diagnostic accuracy was compared with that of serum PSA level, prostate volume (PV), PSA density (PSAD), and free/total PSA ratio (f/t PSA).  Results:   A total of 633 urine samples were successfully analysed (the informative rate was 98%). Median PSA was 7.6 ng/mL. Biopsy revealed cancer in 264 men (41.7%). The PCA3 score for men with prostate cancer was significantly higher than that for men with negative biopsies (median PCA3 score: 49 vs. 18; P < 0.001). The rate of positive biopsy was 16.0% in men with a PCA3 score of <20 and 60.6% in those with a PCA3 score of ≥50. Using a PCA3 score threshold of 35, sensitivity and specificity were 66.5 and 71.6%, respectively. The area under the curve of the PCA3 score was significantly higher than that of the f/t PSA in men with PSA 4-10 ng/mL (0.742 vs 0.647; P < 0.05). In men with PSAD < 0.15 and PCA3 < 20, only three (4.2%) out of 72 men had prostate cancer.

Patients were divided into two groups according to number of positive LNs using the most informative positive LN theshold for predicting survival, then into three different risk groups according to number of positive LNs and pathological Gleason score (GS).  Results:   Mean (range) follow-up was 68.4 (10-192) months.

The present study provides an accurate and dynamic multivariable risk stratification tool that predicts the postoperative urinary incontinence risk after radical prostatectomy based on patient-related as well as surgeon-related variables.  Objective:   To develop a multivariable risk classification tool to estimate postoperative urinary incontinence (UI) risk as UI represents one of the most disabling surgical sequelae after radical prostatectomy (RP).  Patients and methods:   We evaluated 1311 patients treated with nerve-sparing RP between 2006 and 2010 at our institution. Regression tree analysis was used to stratify patients according to their postoperative UI risk. Kaplan-Meier curve estimates were used to assess the UI rate in the novel UI-risk groups. The discrimination of the novel tool was measured with the area under the curve method.  Results:   At 3, 6 and 12 months, the UI rates were 44%, 26% and 12%, respectively. Regression tree analysis stratified patients into high risk (International Index of Erectile Function - Erectile Function domain [IIEF-EF] = 1-10), intermediate risk (IIEF-EF > 10 and age ≥ 65 years), low risk (IIEF-EF > 10, age < 65 years and body mass index [BMI] ≥ 25 kg/m(2) ) and very low risk (IIEF-EF > 10, age < 65 years and BMI < 25 kg/m(2) ) groups.

Main outcome measures:   Subscale of the International Index of Erectile Function, self-reported help-seeking behaviours for erectile dysfunction (ED) and prostate disease, thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews and focus groups.  Results:   The prevalence of moderate-to-severe ED increased across age groups, from about 10% in younger men (under 35 years) to 28% in men aged 55-74 years. Moderate-to-severe ED was strongly associated with reporting a chronic condition (odds ratio [OR], 3.67) and residing in a remote area (OR, 2.94). Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander men aged 40-59 years showed similar low levels of help-seeking behaviours compared with non-Indigenous men from a comparable population-based study. About half of the men with ED saw a doctor or received treatment for ED in each population. While prostate cancer rates were low in both studies, testing for prostate problems was less frequent in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander men (11.4%) than in non-Indigenous men (34.1%, P < 0.001), despite similar levels of concern about prostate cancer. Barriers to help-seeking included shame, culturally inappropriate services and lack of awareness.

Although such alterations in epigenetic marks, including DNA methylation, are potentially heritable, they can also be dynamically altered. Given this potential for plasticity, the degree to which epigenetic changes can be subject to selection and act as drivers of neoplasia has been questioned. We carried out genome-scale analyses of DNA methylation alterations in lethal metastatic prostate cancer and created DNA methylation ""cityscape"" plots to visualize these complex data. We show that somatic DNA methylation alterations, despite showing marked interindividual heterogeneity among men with lethal metastatic prostate cancer, were maintained across all metastases within the same individual. The overall extent of maintenance in DNA methylation changes was comparable to that of genetic copy number alterations. Regions that were frequently hypermethylated across individuals were markedly enriched for cancer- and development/differentiation-related genes. Additionally, regions exhibiting high consistency of hypermethylation across metastases within individuals, even if variably hypermethylated across individuals, showed enrichment for cancer-related genes. Whereas some regions showed intraindividual metastatic tumor heterogeneity in promoter methylation, such methylation alterations were generally not correlated with gene expression. This was despite a general tendency for promoter methylation patterns to be strongly correlated with gene expression, particularly at regions that were variably methylated across individuals. These findings suggest that DNA methylation alterations have the potential for producing selectable driver events in carcinogenesis and disease progression and highlight the possibility of targeting such epigenome alterations for development of longitudinal markers and therapeutic strategies.""","""['Martin J Aryee', 'Wennuan Liu', 'Julia C Engelmann', 'Philipp Nuhn', 'Meltem Gurel', 'Michael C Haffner', 'David Esopi', 'Rafael A Irizarry', 'Robert H Getzenberg', 'William G Nelson', 'Jun Luo', 'Jianfeng Xu', 'William B Isaacs', 'G Steven Bova', 'Srinivasan Yegnasubramanian']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Sci Transl Med""","""['Chromosome-wide mapping of DNA methylation patterns in normal and malignant prostate cells reveals pervasive methylation of gene-associated and conserved intergenic sequences.', 'Intratumor DNA methylation heterogeneity reflects clonal evolution in aggressive prostate cancer.', 'Epigenetic heterogeneity of high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia: clues for clonal progression in prostate carcinogenesis.', 'Prostate Cancer Epigenetics: From Basic Mechanisms to Clinical Implications.', 'Promoter hypermethylation in prostate cancer.', 'KRAB-ZFPs and cancer stem cells identity.', 'Recent advances in understanding DNA methylation of prostate cancer.', 'GENOMICS OF PROSTATE CANCER: CLINICAL UTILITY AND CHALLENGES.', 'Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals Influence Hub Genes Associated with Aggressive Prostate Cancer.', 'DNA Methylation Landscapes of Prostate Cancer Brain Metastasis Are Shaped by Early Driver Genetic Alterations.']"""

Newcastle disease virus (NDV), an avian paramyxovirus, is a promising OV and is inherently tumor selective and cytotoxic only to tumor cells. Replication is restricted in normal cells. Despite encouraging phase I/II clinical trials with NDV, further refinements for tumor-specific targeting are needed to enhance its therapeutic index. Systemically delivered NDV fails to reach solid tumors in therapeutic concentrations and also spreads poorly within the tumors due to barriers including complement, innate immunity, and the extracellular matrix. Overcoming these hurdles is paramount to realizing the exceptional oncolytic efficacy of NDV. We engineered the F protein of NDV and generated a recombinant NDV (rNDV) whose F protein is cleavable exclusively by prostate-specific antigen (PSA). The rNDV replicated efficiently and specifically in prostate cancer (CaP) cells and 3-dimensional prostaspheres but failed to replicate in the absence of PSA. Induction of intracellular PSA production by a synthetic androgen analog (R1881) enhanced fusogenicity in androgen-responsive CaP cells. Further, PSA-cleavable rNDV caused specific lysis of androgen-independent and androgen-responsive/nonresponsive CaP cells and prostaspheres, with a half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) ranging from a multiplicity of infection of 0.01 to 0.1. PSA-retargeted NDV efficiently lysed prostasphere tumor mimics, suggesting efficacy in vivo. Also, PSA-cleavable NDV failed to replicate in chicken embryos, indicating no pathogenicity for chickens.

In the first series, four monospiro derivatives at position C17 were prepared from androsterone (ADT) or epi-ADT. After the protection of the alcohol at C3, the C17-ketone was alkylated with the lithium acetylide of tetrahydro-2-(but-3-ynyl)-2-H-pyran, the triple bond was hydrogenated, the protecting groups hydrolysed and the alcohols oxidized to give the corresponding 3-keto-17-spiro-lactone derivative. The other three compounds were generated from this keto-lactone by reducing the ketone at C3, or by introducing one or two methyl groups. In the second series, two dispiro derivatives at C3 and C17 were prepared from epi-ADT. After introducing a spiro-δ-lactone at C17 and an oxirane at C3, an aminolysis of the oxirane with L-isoleucine methyl ester provided an amino alcohol, which was treated with triphosgene or sodium methylate to afford a carbamate- or a morpholinone-androstane derivative, respectively.

We show that increased Id1 and Id3 protein expression is strongly associated with increasing grade of PCa. At the molecular level, we report that silencing either Id1 or Id3 attenuates cell cycle. Although structurally and mechanistically similar, our results show that both these proteins are noncompensatory at least in PCa progression. Moreover, through gene silencing approaches we show that Id1 and Id3 primarily attenuates CDKN1A (p21) and CDKN1B (p27), respectively. We also demonstrate that silencing Id3 alone significantly attenuates proliferation of PCa cells as compared with Id1.

Of all the four Id proteins, the expression of Id1, Id2, and to a lesser extent, Id3 in prostate cancer and the underlying molecular mechanism is relatively well known. On the contrary, our previous results demonstrated that Id4 acts as a potential tumor suppressor in prostate cancer. In the present study, we extend these observations and demonstrate that Id4 is down-regulated in prostate cancer due to promoter hypermethylation. We used prostate cancer tissue microarrays to investigate Id4 expression. Methylation specific PCR on bisulfite treated DNA was used to determine methylation status of Id4 promoter in laser capture micro-dissected normal, stroma and prostate cancer regions. High Id4 expression was observed in the normal prostate epithelial cells. In prostate cancer, a stage-dependent decrease in Id4 expression was observed with majority of high grade cancers showing no Id4 expression. Furthermore, Id4 expression progressively decreased in prostate cancer cell line LNCaP and with no expression in androgen-insensitive LNCaP-C81 cell line. Conversely, Id4 promoter hypermethylation increased in LNCaP-C81 cells suggesting epigenetic silencing. In prostate cancer samples, loss of Id4 expression was also associated with promoter hypermethylation.

Recent studies have shown that Wnt5a protein levels are up-regulated in prostate cancer, but contrasting reports exist on the role of Wnt5a to predict outcome after radical prostatectomy in patients with localized prostate cancer. Our group has recently shown that preserved high protein expression of Wnt5a in prostate cancer is associated with longer relapse-free time after radical prostatectomy. The present tissue microarray study emphasizes the role of Wnt5a protein expression in a different, well-defined, and independent cohort consisting of 312 prostate cancer patients. Kaplan-Meier curves plotted between Wnt5a expression and time to biochemical recurrence revealed that in low-grade prostate cancer, patients with preserved high-Wnt5a protein levels in their tumor cells have a lower risk of recurrence after radical prostatectomy compared to patients with low-Wnt5a protein expression. When Wnt5a protein expression was added to a Cox regression multivariate analysis, both Wnt5a protein expression and surgical margin status independently predict biochemical free survival. Herein we confirm Wnt5a positivity as a prognostic factor and show that preserved overexpression of Wnt5a protein is associated with increased time to biochemical recurrence in localized low-grade prostate cancer patients after radical prostatectomy.

Despite numerous studies showing the expression of HIF1α protein under normoxia in PC cell lines, the role of this normoxic HIF1α expression in chemo-resistance and migration has not been investigated previously. As no method is currently available to determine which tumors will progress to CRPC, the role of HIF1α in PC and its potential for predicting the development of CRPC was also investigated.  Methods:   The effect of HIF1α protein knockdown on chemo-resistance and migration of PC3 cells was assessed by cell counting and Transwell assays, respectively. Translation efficiency of HIF1α mRNA was determined in PC cells using a HIF1α 5'UTR-luciferase construct. Clinical outcomes were correlated following the staining of 100 prostate tumors for HIF1α expression.  Results:   The CRPC-like cell lines (PC3 and DU145) expressed more HIF1α protein than an androgen sensitive cell line (LNCaP). Migration rate and chemo-resistance were higher in the PC3 cells and both were decreased when HIF1α expression was reduced. Increased translation of HIF1α mRNA may be responsible for HIF1α overexpression in PC3 cells. Patients whose tumors expressed HIF1α had significantly decreased metastasis-free survival and the patients who were on androgen-deprivation therapy had decreased CRPC-free survival on Kaplan-Meier analysis. On multivariate analysis HIF1α was an independent risk factor for progression to metastatic PC (Hazard ratio (HR) 9.8, p = 0.017) and development of CRPC (HR 10.0, p = 0.021) in patients on androgen-deprivation therapy. Notably the tumors which did not express HIF1α did not metastasize or develop CRPC.  Conclusions:   HIF1α is likely to contribute to metastasis and chemo-resistance of CRPC and targeted reduction of HIF1α may increase the responsiveness of CRPCs to chemotherapy.

The Human Protein Atlas (http://www.proteinatlas.org), a database of tissue microarrays labeled with antibodies against over 11,000 human proteins, was utilized to quantify Egr3 protein expression in normal prostate and prostate cancer patients. In agreement with the SPECS data, we found that Egr3 protein is significantly increased in prostate cancer. The SPECS database has the benefit of extensive clinical follow up for the prostate cancer patients. Analysis of Egr3 mRNA expression in relation to the relapse status reveals that Egr3 mRNA expression is increased in tumor cells of non-relapsed samples (n = 63) compared to normal prostate cells, but is significantly lower in relapsed samples (n = 38) compared to non-relapse. The observations were confirmed using an independent data set. A list of genes correlating with this unique expression pattern was determined. These Egr3-correlated genes were enriched with Egr binding sites in their promoters. The gene list contains inflammatory genes such as IL-6, IL-8, IL1β and COX-2, which have extensive connections to prostate cancer.""","""['Rebecca Pio', 'Zhenyu Jia', 'Veronique T Baron', 'Dan Mercola;UCI NCI SPECS Consortium of the Strategic Partners for the Evaluation of Cancer Signatures-Prostate Cancer']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Loss of EGR3 is an independent risk factor for metastatic progression in prostate cancer.', 'Early Growth Response 3 regulates genes of inflammation and directly activates IL6 and IL8 expression in prostate cancer.', 'Overexpressing miR‑335 inhibits DU145 cell proliferation by targeting early growth response 3 in prostate cancer.', 'Early Growth Response Gene Upregulation in Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV)-Associated Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS).', 'Emerging roles of Egr2 and Egr3 in the control of systemic autoimmunity.', 'Alteration of payload in extracellular vesicles by crosstalk with mesenchymal stem cells from different origin.', 'Genome-wide association analysis reveals regulation of at-risk loci by DNA methylation in prostate cancer.', 'Therapeutic targeting with DABIL-4 depletes myeloid suppressor cells in 4T1 triple-negative breast cancer model.', 'A Risk Prediction Model for Breast Cancer Based on Immune Genes Related to Early Growth Response Proteins Family.', 'Loss of EGR3 is an independent risk factor for metastatic progression in prostate cancer.']"""

However, it is unknown whether CLL alters the disease course of these cancers once they occur.  Patients and methods:   All patients with cancers of the breast (n = 579,164), colorectum (n = 412,366), prostate (n = 631,616), lung (n = 489,053), kidney (n = 95,795), pancreas (n = 82,116), and ovary (n = 61,937) reported to the SEER program from 1990 to 2007 were identified. Overall survival (OS; death resulting from any cause) and cancer-specific survival were examined, comparing patients with and without pre-existing CLL. Cancer-specific survival was evaluated for each tumor type in a site-specific manner (eg, death resulting from breast cancer in a patient with breast cancer).  Results:   Patients with cancers of the breast (hazard ratio [HR], 1.70; P < .001), colorectum (HR, 1.65; P < .001), kidney (HR, 1.54; P < .001), prostate (HR, 1.92; P < .001), or lung (HR, 1.19; P < .001) had inferior OS if they had a pre-existing diagnosis of CLL after adjusting for age, sex, race, and disease stage. These results for OS remained significant for patients with cancers of the breast, colorectum, and prostate after excluding or censoring CLL-related deaths. Cancer-specific survival was also inferior for patients with cancers of the breast (HR, 1.41; P = .005) and colorectum (HR, 1.46; P < .001) who had pre-existing CLL after adjusting for age, sex, race, and disease stage.  Conclusion:   Inferior OS and cancer-specific survival was observed for several common cancers in patients with pre-existing CLL.

Such rearrangements can also frequently be observed in cancer and have been postulated as driving event in cancer development. to detect them, one needs to analyze the transition region of two segments with different copy number, the location where fusions are known to occur. Finding fusion genes is essential to understanding cancer development and may lead to new therapeutic approaches.  Results:   Here we present a novel method, the Genomic Fusion Detection algorithm, to predict fusion genes on a genomic level based on SNP-array data. This algorithm detects genes at the transition region of segments with copy number variation. With the application of defined constraints, certain properties of the detected genes are evaluated to predict whether they may be fused. We evaluated our prediction by calculating the observed frequency of known fusions in both primary cancers and cell lines. We tested a set of cell lines positive for the BCR-ABL1 fusion and prostate cancers positive for the TMPRSS2-ERG fusion.

Unlike Bcl-2, Mcl-1 is not antagonized by ABT-263 or ABT-737 and is considered to be a major factor in resistance. Also, Mcl-1 exhibits differential regulation when compared with other Bcl-2 family members and is a target for anticancer drug discovery. Here, we demonstrate that BAG3, an Hsp70 co-chaperone, protects Mcl-1 from proteasomal degradation, thereby promoting its antiapoptotic activity. Using neuroblastoma cell lines, with a defined Bcl-2 family dependence, we found that BAG3 expression correlated with Mcl-1 dependence and ABT-737 resistance. RNA silencing of BAG3 led to a marked reduction in Mcl-1 protein levels and overcame ABT-737 resistance in Mcl-1-dependent cells. In ABT-737-resistant cells, Mcl-1 co-immunoprecipitated with BAG3, and loss of Mcl-1 after BAG3 silencing was prevented by proteasome inhibition. BAG3 and Mcl-1 were co-expressed in a panel of diverse cancer cell lines resistant to ABT-737. Silencing BAG3 reduced Mcl-1 protein levels and overcame ABT-737 resistance in several of the cell lines, including triple-negative breast cancer (MDA-MB231) and androgen receptor-negative prostate cancer (PC3) cells.

Although the mechanism underlying its progression still remains unclear, epigenetic modifications are important ethological parameters. The purpose of this study is to determine the methylation status and function of hypermethylatioted in cancer 1 (HIC1) in prostate cancer progression.  Experimental design:   The methylation status of HIC1 promoter was assayed in cell lines, tissues, and plasma of patients with prostate cancer by using methylation-specific PCR and bisulfate sequencing PCR. The ability of HIC1 to regulate proliferation, migration, and invasion was assessed by MTT, scratch-healing assay, and reconstituted extracellular matrices in porous culture chambers. Tumorigenesis, metastases, and bone destruction were analyzed in mice bearing prostate cancer cells restoring HIC1 by using Xenogen IVIS with radiographic system and small-animal positron emission tomography computed tomographic images. Microarrays were searched for genes that had correlated expression with HIC1 mRNA. Reporter gene assays were used to determine whether HIC1 affected the expression of CXCR7, and chromatin immunoprecipitation was used to determine whether HIC1 bound to CXCR7 promoters. All P values were determined using 2-sided tests.  Results:   The methylation status of 11 CpG sites within HIC1 promoter was abundantly methylated in cell lines, tissues, and plasma of patients with prostate cancer compared with those of respective normal controls. Restoring HIC1 expression in prostate cancer cells markedly inhibited proliferation, migration, and invasion and induced the apoptosis in these cells. Moreover, mice bearing prostate cancer-restoring HIC1 cells had a marked effect on reducing tumor growth, multiple tissue metastases, and bone destruction. Notably, we also identified that the chemokine receptor CXCR7 is a direct downstream target gene of HIC1. Finally, we showed that CXCR7 promoter in prostate cancer cells is negatively regulated by HIC1, which may be responsible for prostate cancer progression.  Conclusions:   Our data show for the first time that hypermethylation of HIC1 promoter results in loss of its repressive function, responsible for prostate cancer progression and invasion. These findings suggest that therapies targeting epigenetic events regulating HIC1 expression may provide a more effective strategy for prostate cancer treatment.""","""['Jianghua Zheng', 'Jinglong Wang', 'Xueqing Sun', 'Mingang Hao', 'Tao Ding', 'Dan Xiong', 'Xiumin Wang', 'Yu Zhu', 'Gang Xiao', 'Guangcun Cheng', 'Meizhong Zhao', 'Jian Zhang', 'Jianhua Wang']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Clin Cancer Res""","""['Scavenger chemokine (CXC motif) receptor 7 (CXCR7) is a direct target gene of HIC1 (hypermethylated in cancer 1).', 'Association between HIC1 and RASSF1A promoter hypermethylation with MTHFD1 G1958A polymorphism and clinicopathological features of breast cancer in Iranian patients.', 'Hypermethylated in cancer 1(HIC1) suppresses non-small cell lung cancer progression by targeting interleukin-6/Stat3 pathway.', 'Epigenetic susceptibility factors for prostate cancer with aging.', 'Promoter hypermethylation in prostate cancer.', 'Ferroptosis-related gene HIC1 in the prediction of the prognosis and immunotherapeutic efficacy with immunological activity.', 'Mechanistic Insights into Harmine-Mediated Inhibition of Human DNA Methyltransferases and Prostate Cancer Cell Growth.', 'DNA methylation patterns suggest the involvement of DNMT3B and TET1 in osteosarcoma development.', 'CXCR7 as a novel therapeutic target for advanced prostate cancer.', 'Small extracellular vesicle-associated miR-6068 promotes aggressive phenotypes of prostate cancer through miR-6068/HIC2/SIRT1 axis.']"""

Design, setting, and participants:   We included 963 PCa cases (700 HPFS; 263 PHS) that provided prediagnostic blood samples, in 1982 for PHS and in 1993-1995 for HPFS, in which circulating sex hormone levels were assayed.  Outcome measures and statistical analysis:   The primary end point was lethal PCa (defined as cancer-specific mortality or development of metastases), and we also assessed total mortality through March 2011. We used Cox proportional hazards models to evaluate the association of prediagnostic sex hormone levels with time from diagnosis to development of lethal PCa or total mortality.  Results and limitations:   PCa cases were followed for a mean of 12.0±4.9 yr after diagnosis. We confirmed 148 cases of lethal PCa and 421 deaths overall. Using Cox proportional hazard models, we found no significant association between quartile of total testosterone, sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), SHBG-adjusted testosterone, free testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, androstanediol glucuronide, or estradiol and lethal PCa or total mortality. In subset analyses stratified by Gleason score, TNM stage, age, and interval between blood draw and diagnosis, there was also no consistent association between lethal PCa and sex hormone quartile.

The primary endpoint was the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression-free survival (PPFS) rate at 24 weeks; a 45% success rate in either arm was prespecified as constituting clinical significance. Secondary endpoints included the progression-free survival (PFS) rate and PSA response rate (Prostate Cancer Working Group criteria). Exploratory outcomes included circulating tumor cell (CTC) enumeration, serum androgen measurements, as well as pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analyses.  Results:   The high-dose arm enrolled to completion (n = 29), but the low-dose arm closed early (n = 17) because of a prespecified futility rule.

The method was tested using a leave-one-out strategy on a database of 21 pre-segmented prostate patients for different image registrations combined with different image similarity scorings. The probabilistic weighting yields results that are equal or better compared to both fusion with equal weights and results using the STAPLE algorithm.

Gadolinium-153 is an intermediate-energy isotope that emits 40-100 keV photons with a half-life of 242 days. The rationale for considering (153)Gd as a brachytherapy source is for its potential of patient specific shielding and to enable reduced personnel shielding requirements relative to (192)Ir, and as an isotope for interstitial rotating shield brachytherapy (I-RSBT). A hypothetical (153)Gd brachytherapy source with an active core of 0.84 mm diameter, 10 mm length and specific activity of 5.55 TBq of (153)Gd per gram of Gd was simulated with Geant4. The encapsulation material was stainless steel with a thickness of 0.08 mm. The radial dose function, anisotropy function and photon spectrum in water were calculated for the (153)Gd source. The simulated (153)Gd source had an activity of 242 GBq and a dose rate in water 1 cm off axis of 13.12 Gy h(-1), indicating that it would be suitable as a low-dose-rate or pulsed-dose-rate brachytherapy source. The beta particles emitted have low enough energies to be absorbed in the source encapsulation. Gadolinium-153 has an increasing radial dose function due to multiple scatter of low-energy photons. Scattered photon dose takes over with distance from the source and contributes to the majority of the absorbed dose. The anisotropy function of the (153)Gd source decreases at low polar angles, as a result of the long active core. The source is less anisotropic at polar angles away from the longitudinal axes. The anisotropy function increases with increasing distance. The (153)Gd source considered would be suitable as an intermediate-energy low-dose-rate or pulsed-dose-rate brachytherapy source. The source could provide a means for I-RSBT delivery and enable brachytherapy treatments with patient specific shielding and reduced personnel shielding requirements relative to (192)Ir.""","""['Shirin A Enger', 'Darrell R Fisher', 'Ryan T Flynn']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Interstitial rotating shield brachytherapy for prostate cancer.', 'Modeling a hypothetical 170Tm source for brachytherapy applications.', 'Exploring (57)Co as a new isotope for brachytherapy applications.', 'Dose rate in brachytherapy using after-loading machine: pulsed or high-dose rate?', 'A comparison of intravascular source designs based on the beta particle emitter 114mIn/114In.

MiRNAs are new key players in the disease paradigm demonstrating roles in several human diseases. The functional association between miRNAs and diseases remains largely unclear and far from complete. With the advent of high-throughput functional genomics techniques that infer genes and biological pathways dysregulted in diseases, it is now possible to infer functional association between diseases and biological molecules by integrating disparate biological information.  Results:   Here, we first used Lasso regression model to identify miRNAs associated with disease signature as a proof of concept. Then we proposed an integrated approach that uses disease-gene associations from microarray experiments and text mining, and miRNA-gene association from computational predictions and protein networks to build functional associations network between miRNAs and diseases. The findings of the proposed model were validated against gold standard datasets using ROC analysis and results were promising (AUC=0.81). Our protein network-based approach discovered 19 new functional associations between prostate cancer and miRNAs. The new 19 associations were validated using miRNA expression data and clinical profiles and showed to act as diagnostic and prognostic prostate biomarkers. The proposed integrated approach allowed us to reconstruct functional associations between miRNAs and human diseases and uncovered functional roles of newly discovered miRNAs.  Conclusions:   Lasso regression was used to find associations between diseases and miRNAs using their gene signature. Defining miRNA gene signature by integrating the downstream effect of miRNAs demonstrated better performance than the miRNA signature alone. Integrating biological networks and multiple data to define miRNA and disease gene signature demonstrated high performance to uncover new functional associations between miRNAs and diseases.""","""['Ala Qabaja', 'Mohammed Alshalalfa', 'Tarek A Bismar', 'Reda Alhajj']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""EURASIP J Bioinform Syst Biol""","""['Using context-specific effect of miRNAs to identify functional associations between miRNAs and gene signatures.', 'MicroRNA Response Elements-Mediated miRNA-miRNA Interactions in Prostate Cancer.', 'Detecting microRNAs of high influence on protein functional interaction networks: a prostate cancer case study.', 'A Computational Model to Predict the Causal miRNAs for Diseases.', 'MicroRNAs and complex diseases: from experimental results to computational models.', 'Feasibility and Potential of Transcriptomic Analysis Using the NanoString nCounter Technology to Aid the Classification of Rejection in Kidney Transplant Biopsies.', 'Bipartite graph-based collaborative matrix factorization method for predicting miRNA-disease associations.', 'Feature selection for RNA cleavage efficiency at specific sites using the LASSO regression model in Arabidopsis thaliana.', 'Predicting miRNA-Disease Associations by Incorporating Projections in Low-Dimensional Space and Local Topological Information.', 'Inferring the Disease-Associated miRNAs Based on Network Representation Learning and Convolutional Neural Networks.']"""

Mechanisms by which these cells survive are not well understood. By immunohistochemistry of human tissues, we found that levels of β1 integrins and integrin-induced autophosphorylation of FAK (pFAK-Y397) are increased in prostate cancer cells in primary prostate cancer and lymph node metastases, suggesting that β1 integrin activation occurs in metastatic progression of prostate cancer. A conformation-sensitive antibody, 9EG7, was used to examine β1 integrin activation. We found that β1 integrins are constitutively activated in highly metastatic PC3 and PC3-mm2 cells, with less activation in low metastatic LNCaP and C4-2B4 cells. Increased β1 integrin activation as well as the anoikis resistance in prostate cancer cells correlated with metastatic potential in vivo. Knockdown of β1 integrin abrogated anoikis resistance in PC3-mm2 cells. In agreement with β1 integrin activation, PC3-mm2 cells strongly adhered to type I collagen and fibronectin, a process inhibited by the β1 integrin-neutralizing antibody mAb 33B6. mAb 33B6 also inhibited the phosphorylation of β1 integrin downstream effectors, focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and AKT, leading to a 3-fold increase in PC3-mm2 apoptosis. Systemic delivery of mAb 33B6 suppressed spontaneous metastasis of PC3-mm2 from the prostate to distant lymph nodes following intraprostatic injection and suppressed metastasis of PC3-mm2 to multiple organs following intracardiac injection. Thus, constitutively activated β1 integrins play a role in survival of PC3-mm2 cells in circulation and represent a potential target for metastasis prevention.""","""['Yu-Chen Lee', 'Jung-Kang Jin', 'Chien-Jui Cheng', 'Chih-Fen Huang', 'Jian H Song', 'Miao Huang', 'Wells S Brown', 'Sui Zhang', 'Li-Yuan Yu-Lee', 'Edward T Yeh', 'Bradley W McIntyre', 'Christopher J Logothetis', 'Gary E Gallick', 'Sue-Hwa Lin']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Res""","""['Talin1 phosphorylation activates β1 integrins: a novel mechanism to promote prostate cancer bone metastasis.', 'Silibinin inhibits fibronectin induced motility, invasiveness and survival in human prostate carcinoma PC3 cells via targeting integrin signaling.', 'Resistance to the mTOR-inhibitor RAD001 elevates integrin α2- and β1-triggered motility, migration and invasion of prostate cancer cells.', 'Targeting anoikis resistance in prostate cancer metastasis.', 'Significance of talin in cancer progression and metastasis.', 'Meta-analysis of expression and the targeting of cell adhesion associated genes in nine cancer types - A one research lab re-evaluation.', 'Anoikis in phenotypic reprogramming of the prostate tumor microenvironment.', 'The role of integrin family in bone metabolism and tumor bone metastasis.', 'The Emerging Role of Cell Adhesion Molecules on Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia.', 'In Vitro Models of Ovarian Cancer: Bridging the Gap between Pathophysiology and Mechanistic Models.']"""

G-protein coupled receptor 64 (GPR64), an orphan receptor with normal expression restricted to human epididymis is specifically over-expressed in ES among sarcoma, but also up-regulated in a number of carcinomas derived from prostate, kidney or lung. Inhibition of GPR64 expression in ES by RNA interference impaired colony formation in vitro and suppressed local tumour growth and metastasis in Rag2(-/-) γC (-/-) mice. Microarray analysis after GPR64 knock down revealed a GPR64-mediated repression of genes involved in neuronal development like SLIT, drosophila, homolog of, 2 (SLIT2), and genes regulating transcription including pre-B cell leukemia homeobox 2 (PBX2). Concurrently, the suppression of GPR64 increased ES susceptibility to TRAIL induced apoptosis. Moreover, a GPR64-mediated induction of placental growth factor (PGF) in ES was observed. PGF suppression by RNA interference resulted in a reduction of metastatic growth similar to that observed after GPR64 knock down. Importantly, inhibition of GPR64 as well as PGF expression was associated with a reduced expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 1 and invasiveness in vitro. Furthermore, MMP1 knock down abrogated lung metastasis in Rag2(-/-) γC (-/-) mice.

Methods:   Patients with advanced cancer from six countries completed the QLQ-C15-PAL at consultation and at one follow-up point. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were conducted to determine the predictive value of the EORTC QLQ-C15-PAL functional/symptom scores for global QOL (question 15).  Results:   Three hundred forty-nine patients completed the EORTC QLQ-C15-PAL at baseline. In the total patient sample, worse emotional functioning, pain, and appetite loss were the most significant predictive factors for worse QOL. In the subgroup of patients with bone metastases (n = 240), the domains mentioned above were also the most significant predictors, whereas in patients with brain metastases (n = 109), worse physical and emotional functioning most significantly predicted worse QOL. One-month follow-up in 267 patients revealed that the significant predictors changed somewhat over time. For example, in the total patient sample, physical functioning, fatigue, and appetite loss were significant predictors at the follow-up point. A sub-analysis of predictive factors affecting QOL by primary cancer (lung, breast, and prostate) was also conducted for the total patient sample.

There are multiple potential strategies that use the immune system, including therapeutic cancer vaccines that are designed to stimulate immune cells to target antigens expressed by cancer cells. Sipuleucel-T is a vaccine currently approved for the treatment of minimally symptomatic metastatic prostate cancer, whereas the vaccine PSA-TRICOM and the immune-checkpoint inhibitor ipilimumab are in phase III testing. Although there are no short-term changes in disease progression or available biomarkers to assess response, these agents appear to improve survival. One hypothesis suggests that this apparent paradox can be explained by the growth-moderating effects of these treatments, which do not cause tumor size to diminish, but rather stall or slow their growth rate over time. For this reason, the use of immunotherapy earlier in the disease process is being investigated. Another approach is to block immune-regulatory mechanisms mediated by the molecules cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 and programmed cell death protein 1. Additional future strategies will combine immunotherapy with other standard therapies, potentially enhancing the latter's clinical impact and thereby improving both time to progression and overall survival due to the combined effects of both treatments.

Sixty-five percent received all minimum recommended care over 3 years (breast = 74.1%, prostate = 65.3%, colorectal = 25.5%). During the 3-year period, 74.1% of breast cancer survivors received a mammogram each year, whereas 69.1% of colorectal cancer survivors had at least 1 colonoscopy.

Previous efforts have quantified shifts in proton depth dose distributions due to I-value uncertainties in water and homogenous tissue phantoms. This study is the first to quantify the clinical impact of I-value uncertainties on proton dose distributions within patient geometries. A previously developed Geant4 based Monte Carlo code was used to simulate a proton treatment plan for three patients (prostate, pancreases, and liver) with varying tissue I-values. A uniform variation study was conducted in which the tissue I-values were varied by ±5% and ±10% of the nominal values as well as a probabilistic variation study in which the I-values were randomly sampled according to a normal distribution with the mean equal to the nominal I-value and a standard deviation of 5 and 10% of the nominal values. Modification of tissue I-values impacted both the proton range and SOBP width. R(90) range shifts up to 7.7 mm (4.4.%) and R(80) range shifts up to 4.8 mm (1.9%) from the nominal range were recorded. Modulating the tissue I-values by 10% the nominal value resulted in up to a 3.5% difference mean dose in the target volumes and organs at risk compared to the nominal case. The range and dose differences were the largest for the deeper-seated prostate and pancreas cases. The treatments that were simulated with randomly sampled I-values resulted in range and dose differences that were generally within the upper and lower bounds set by the 10% uniform variations. This study demonstrated the impact of I-value uncertainties on patient dose distributions. Clearly, sub-millimeter precision in proton therapy would necessitate a reduction in I-value uncertainties to ensure an efficacious clinical outcome.""","""['Abigail Besemer', 'Harald Paganetti', 'Bryan Bednarz']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Optimized I-values for use with the Bragg additivity rule and their impact on proton stopping power and range uncertainty.', 'Statistical assessment of proton treatment plans under setup and range uncertainties.', 'Monte Carlo study on the sensitivity of prompt gamma imaging to proton range variations due to interfractional changes in prostate cancer patients.', 'Acoustic-based proton range verification in heterogeneous tissue: simulation studies.', 'Range uncertainties in proton therapy and the role of Monte Carlo simulations.', 'Emerging technologies for cancer therapy using accelerated particles.', 'Energy Deposition around Swift Carbon-Ion Tracks in Liquid Water.', 'Secondary particle production and physical properties during dose enhancement for spread-out Bragg peaks.', 'Physics and biomedical challenges of cancer therapy with accelerated heavy ions.', 'Dosimetric impact of range uncertainty in passive scattering proton therapy.']"""

Results:   During the first 6 months after diagnosis, there were 38 suicides among men with prostate cancer; incidence rate 0.73 per 1000 person-years (PY) and 30 suicides in the comparison cohort; 0.11 per 1000 PY, corresponding to a RR of suicide of 6.5 (95% confidence interval (CI) 4.0-10). Risk was highest among men with distant metastases, incidence rate 1.25 per 1000 PY, RR 10 (95% CI 5.1-21) but risk was also increased for men with low-risk tumours, incidence rate difference 0.45 per 1000 PY and RR 5.2 (95% CI 2.3-12) and across categories of socioeconomic status and comorbidity. Eighteen months after diagnosis, risk of suicide had decreased to 0.27 per 1000 PY, RR 1.0 (95% CI 0.68-1.5) for low-risk prostate cancer but remained increased among men with metastases, 0.57 per 1000 PY, RR 1.8 (95% CI 1.1-2.9).

Understanding the interactions of PAs with cells and the mechanisms of their internalization and intracellular trafficking is critical in their further development for therapeutic delivery applications.  Methodology/principal findings:   PAs of a novel, cell- and tissue-penetrating peptide were synthesized possessing two different lipophilic tail architectures and their interactions with prostate cancer cells were studied in vitro. Cell uptake of peptides was greatly enhanced post-modification. Internalization occurred via lipid-raft mediated endocytosis and was common for the two analogs studied. On the contrary, we identified the non-peptidic part as the determining factor of differences between intracellular trafficking and retention of PAs. PAs composed of di-stearyl lipid tails linked through poly(ethylene glycol) to the peptide exhibited higher exocytosis rates and employed different recycling pathways compared to ones consisting of di-palmitic-coupled peptides. As a result, cell association of the former PAs decreased with time.  Conclusions/significance:   Control over peptide intracellular localization and retention is possible by appropriate modification with synthetic hydrophobic tails.

Importantly, p68 forms complexes with nuclear β-Catenin and promotes gene transcription in colon cancer indicating a functional interplay between these two proteins in cancer progression. In this study, we explore the relationship of p68 and β-Catenin in PCa to assess their potential co-operation in AR-dependent gene expression, which may be of importance in the development of castrate resistant prostate cancer (CRPCa). We use immunoprecipitation to demonstrate a novel interaction between p68 and β-Catenin in the nucleus of PCa cells, which is androgen dependent in LNCaP cells but androgen independent in a hormone refractory derivative of the same cell line (representative of the CRPCa disease type). Enhanced AR activity is seen in androgen-dependent luciferase reporter assays upon transient co-transfection of p68 and β-Catenin as an additive effect, and p68-depleted Chromatin-Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) showed a decrease in the recruitment of the AR and β-Catenin to androgen responsive promoter regions. In addition, we found p68 immunoprecipitated with the processive and non-processive form of RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) and show p68 recruited to elongating regions of the AR mediated PSA gene, suggesting a role for p68 in facilitating RNAP II transcription of AR mediated genes.

Here, we determine whether castration therapy impairs nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) by downregulating Ku70 protein expression.  Experimental design:   Twenty patients with locally advanced prostate cancer were enrolled, and 6 to 12 needle core biopsy specimens were taken from the prostate of each patient before treatment. Bilateral orchidectomy was conducted in eight patients and 12 patients were treated with a GnRH agonist. After castration, two to four similar biopsies were obtained, and the levels of Ku70 and γ-H2AX foci were determined by immunofluorescence in verified cancer tissues.  Results:   We observed that the androgen receptor binds directly to Ku70 in prostate tissue. We also found a reduction of the Ku70 protein levels in the cell nuclei in 12 of 14 patients (P < 0.001) after castration. The reduction in Ku70 expression correlated significantly with decreased serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels after castration, suggesting that androgen receptor activity regulates Ku70 protein levels in prostate cancer tissue. Furthermore, a significant correlation between the reductions of Ku70 after castration versus changes induced of castration of γ-H2AX foci could be seen implicating a functional linkage of decreased Ku70 levels and impaired DNA repair.  Conclusions:   Castration therapy results in decreased levels of the Ku70 protein in prostate cancer cells. Because the Ku70 protein is essential for the NHEJ repair of DSBs and its downregulation impairs DNA repair, this offers a possible explanation for the increased radiosensitivity of prostate cancer cells following castration.""","""['Firas L T Al-Ubaidi', 'Niklas Schultz', 'Olga Loseva', 'Lars Egevad', 'Torvald Granfors', 'Thomas Helleday']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Clin Cancer Res""","""[""Editor's Note: Castration Therapy Results in Decreased Ku70 Levels in Prostate Cancer."", 'Castration radiosensitizes prostate cancer tissue by impairing DNA double-strand break repair.', 'Pterygium and genetic polymorphism of DNA double strand break repair gene Ku70.', 'Phosphorylation of Ku dictates DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair pathway choice in S phase.', 'The role of Ku antigen in the repair of apurinic/apyrimidinic sites in DNA.', 'The Role of Ku70 as a Cytosolic DNA Sensor in Innate Immunity and Beyond.', 'Recent Research Advances in Double-Strand Break and Mismatch Repair Defects in Prostate Cancer and Potential Clinical Applications.', 'Androgen Receptor Splice Variants Contribute to the Upregulation of DNA Repair in Prostate Cancer.', 'Tousled-like kinase 1: a novel factor with multifaceted role in mCRPC progression and development of therapy resistance.', 'The spectrum of sex differences in cancer.', 'Co-Inhibition of Androgen Receptor and PARP as a Novel Treatment Paradigm in Prostate Cancer-Where Are We Now?']"""

These PCa cells were treated with the histone deacetylase inhibitor, valproic acid (VPA), and we demonstrated that VPA treatment has an antimigrative, antiinvasive and antiproliferative effect on PCa cells. Using microarray analyses, we discovered several candidate genes that could contribute to the cellular effects we observed. In this study, we could demonstrate that VPA treatment of PCa cells causes the re-expression of cyclin D2, a known regulator that is frequently lost in PCa as we could show using immunohistochemical analyses on PCa specimens. We demonstrate that VPA specifically induces the re-expression of cyclin D2, one of the highly conserved D-type cyclin family members, in several cancer cell lines with weak or no cyclin D2 expression. Interestingly, VPA treatment had no effect in fibroblasts, which typically have high basal levels of cyclin D2 expression. The re-expression of cyclin D2 observed in PCa cells is activated by increased histone acetylation in the promoter region of the Ccnd2 gene and represents one underlying molecular mechanism of VPA treatment that inhibits the proliferation of cancer cells.

We developed two dual-color immunohistochemistry-based assays for the simultaneous assessment of ERG-PTEN and ERG-SPINK1 in prostate cancer. A total of 232 cases from 184 localized and 48 metastatic prostate cancers were evaluated for ERG-PTEN and 284 cases from 228 localized and 56 metastatic prostate cancers were evaluated for ERG-SPINK1. Of the 232 cases evaluated for ERG-PTEN, 81 (35%) ERG-positive and 77 (33%) PTEN-deleted cases were identified. Of the 81 ERG-positive cases, PTEN loss was confirmed in 35 (15%) cases by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). PTEN status was concordant in 203 cases (sensitivity 90% and specificity 87%; P<0.0001) by both immunohistochemisty and FISH; however, immunohistochemisty could not distinguish between heterozygous and homozygous deletion status of PTEN. Of the 284 cases evaluated for ERG-SPINK1, 111 (39%) cases were positive for ERG. In the remaining 173 ERG-negative cases, SPINK1 was positive in 26 (9%) cases. SPINK1 expression was found to be mutually exclusive with ERG expression; however, we identified two cases, of which one showed concomitant expression of ERG and SPINK1 in the same tumor foci, and in the second case ERG and SPINK1 were seen in two independent foci of the same tumor nodule. Unlike the homogenous ERG staining in cancer tissues, heterogeneous SPINK1 staining was observed in the majority of the cases. Further studies are required to understand the molecular heterogeneity of cases with concomitant ERG-SPINK1 expression.

We sought to determine the relationship between UTI and in-hospital mortality, postoperative complications, length of stay, and costs in head and neck cancer (HNCA) surgery.  Study design:   Cross-sectional analysis using cross-tabulations and multivariate regression modeling.  Setting:   The Nationwide Inpatient Sample database.  Subjects and methods:   Discharge data for 93,663 patients who underwent an ablative procedure for a malignant oral cavity, laryngeal, hypopharyngeal, or oropharyngeal neoplasm in 2003-2008 were analyzed.  Results:   Urinary tract infection was diagnosed in 2% of patients, with catheter-associated UTI coded in only 20 patients. Patients with UTI were more likely to be older than 80 years (odds ratio [OR], 3.3; P = .008), be female (OR, 1.9; P < .001), have advanced comorbidity (OR, 1.8; P < .012), undergo major surgical procedures (OR, 1.7; P = .001), and have predisposing bladder and prostate conditions (OR, 3.8; P < .001), surgical complications (OR, 2.3; P < .001), and acute medical complications (OR, 3.1; P < .001). Urinary tract infection was associated with significantly increased length of hospitalization and hospital-related costs, after controlling for all other variables.  Conclusion:   Urinary tract infection is unusual in HNCA surgical patients but is more common with extent of surgery and age and is significantly associated with postoperative complications, length of hospitalization, and hospital-related costs. Catheter-associated UTI is likely underestimated because of difficulty in distinguishing between a catheter-associated UTI and postoperative UTI in patients undergoing major surgical procedures, who routinely undergo perioperative urinary catheterization.

Additionally, it suppressed Pten loss-driven prostate tumorigenesis in tissue recombination experiments. We traced this defect back to an inability of signaling-defective β4 to sustain self-renewal of putative cancer stem cells in vitro and proliferation of transit-amplifying cells in vivo. Mechanistic studies indicated that mutant β4 fails to promote transactivation of ErbB2 and c-Met in prostate tumor progenitor cells and human cancer cell lines. Pharmacological inhibition of ErbB2 and c-Met reduced the ability of prostate tumor progenitor cells to undergo self-renewal in vitro.

While tumors initially respond to androgen-deprivation therapy, the standard care for advanced or metastatic disease, tumors eventually recur as castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Upregulation of the insulin-like growth factor receptor type I (IGF-IR) signaling axis drives growth and progression of prostate cancer by promoting proliferation, survival, and angiogenesis. Ganitumab (formerly AMG 479) is a fully human antibody that inhibits binding of IGF-I and IGF-II to IGF-IR. We evaluated the therapeutic value of ganitumab in several preclinical settings including androgen-dependent prostate cancer, CRPC, and in combination with androgen-deprivation therapy. Ganitumab inhibited IGF-I-induced phosphorylation of the downstream effector AKT and reduced proliferation of multiple androgen-dependent and castration-resistant human prostate cancer cell lines in vitro. Ganitumab inhibited androgen-dependent VCaP xenograft growth and increased tumor-doubling time from 2.3 ± 0.4 weeks to 6.4 ± 0.4 weeks. Ganitumab blocked growth of castration-resistant VCaP xenografts for over 11.5 weeks of treatment. In contrast, ganitumab did not have appreciable effects on the castration-resistant CWR-22Rv1 xenograft model. Ganitumab was most potent against VCaP xenografts when combined with complete androgen-deprivation therapy (castration). Tumor volume was reduced by 72% after 4 weeks of treatment and growth suppression was maintained over 16 weeks of treatment. These data suggest that judicious use of ganitumab particularly in conjunction with androgen-deprivation therapy may be beneficial in the treatment of prostate cancer.""","""['Cale D Fahrenholtz', 'Pedro J Beltran', 'Kerry L Burnstein']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Ther""","""['A novel calcium-dependent mechanism of acquired resistance to IGF-1 receptor inhibition in prostate cancer cells.', 'Ganitumab (AMG 479) inhibits IGF-II-dependent ovarian cancer growth and potentiates platinum-based chemotherapy.', 'Effect of a low-fat diet combined with IGF-1 receptor blockade on 22Rv1 prostate cancer xenografts.', 'Insulin-like growth factor receptor-1 (IGF-IR) as a target for prostate cancer therapy.', 'Plasma and tissue insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR) as a prognostic marker for prostate cancer and anti-IGF-IR agents as novel therapeutic strategy for refractory cases: a review.', 'Costs and Causes of Oncology Drug Attrition With the Example of Insulin-Like Growth Factor-1 Receptor Inhibitors.', 'Emerging Role of IGF-1 in Prostate Cancer: A Promising Biomarker and Therapeutic Target.', 'Connecting the Dots Between the Gut-IGF-1-Prostate Axis: A Role of IGF-1 in Prostate Carcinogenesis.', 'Post-Translational Modifications That Drive Prostate Cancer Progression.', 'Insulin-like growth factor receptor signaling in tumorigenesis and drug resistance: a challenge for cancer therapy.']"""

In some clinical scenarios, such as lung or breast cancer, the risk of severe radiation dermatitis may limit beam arrangement and prescription doses. Patients undergoing proton therapy for prostate cancer commonly develop mild radiation dermatitis. Herein, we report the outcomes of two prostate cancer patients whose radiation dermatitis appears to have been substantially diminished by transparent film dressings (Beekley stickers).  Methods:   This is a descriptive report of the skin toxicity observed in two patients undergoing proton therapy for prostate cancer at a single institution in 2011. A phantom dosimetric study was performed to evaluate the impact of a transparent film dressing on a beam's spread out Bragg peak (SOBP).  Results:   Two patients with low risk prostate cancer were treated with proton therapy to a total dose of 79.2Gy (RBE) in 1.8 Gy (RBE) fractions using two opposed lateral beams daily. Both patients had small circular (2.5 cm diameter) transparent adhesive markers placed on their skin to assist with daily alignment. Patient 1 had markers in place bilaterally for the entirety of treatment. Patient 2 had a marker in place for three weeks on one side and six weeks on the other. Over the course of therapy, both men developed typical Grade 1 radiation dermatitis (asymptomatic erythema) on their hips; however, in both patients, the erythema was substantially decreased beneath the markers. Patient 2 demonstrated less attenuation and thus greater erythema in the skin covered for three weeks compared to the skin covered for six weeks. The difference in skin changes between the covered and uncovered skin persisted for at least 1 month. A phantom study of double scattered beam SOBP with and without the marker in the beam path showed no gross dosimetric effect.  Conclusions:   Transparent adhesive markers appear to have attenuated radiation dermatitis in these two patients without affecting the SOBP. One patient may have exhibited a dose-response effect. The reproducibility and underlying mechanisms are unclear. However, the potential to leverage this effect to improve proton-related radiation dermatitis in other clinical scenarios is intriguing.

The present study was carried out to evaluate and validate prognostic grouping in prostate cancer patients.  Methods:   The 15 259 study patients treated with primary androgen deprivation therapy were enrolled in the Japan Study Group of Prostate Cancer. Overall survival was stratified by tumor-nodes-metastasis, Gleason score and prostate-specific antigen, and extensively analyzed. The accuracy of grouping systems was evaluated by the concordance index.  Results:   The 5-year overall survival in prognostic grouping-I, IIA, IIB, III and IV was 90.0%, 88.3%, 84.8%, 80.6% and 57.1%, respectively.

When prognostic grouping-IIB was subclassified into IIB1 (except IIB2) and IIB2 (T1-2b, prostate-specific antigen >20, Gleason score ≥8, and T2c, Gleason score ≥8), the 5-year overall survival of IIB2 was significantly lower than that of IIB1 (79.4% and 87.3%, P < 0.0001). Also, when prognostic grouping-IV was subclassified into IV1 (except IV2) and IV2 (M1, prostate-specific antigen >100 or Gleason score ≥8), the 5-year overall survival of prognostic grouping-IV1 was superior to that of IV2 (72.9% and 49.5%, P < 0.0001).

Methods to predict clinical outcomes will advance the field and provide new insights into critical determinants of in vivo efficacy.  Experimental design:   This retrospective study included 141 subjects from phase II trials of PROSTVAC-VF, a poxvirus-based cancer vaccine currently in phase III clinical trials for advanced prostate cancer. A glycan microarray was used to profile prevaccination antiglycan antibody populations in sera as potential biomarkers for PROSTVAC-VF. The screen for predictive biomarkers identified antiglycan antibodies that consistently stratified subjects into groups with different Kaplan-Meier survival estimates. Because of the potential for overfitting, a permutation test was used to estimate the false discovery rate.  Results:   Prevaccination antibody levels to blood group A trisaccharide (BG-Atri) were found to have a statistically significant correlation with survival. Long-term survival was approximately doubled in subjects with abundant anti-BG-Atri immunoglobulin M (IgM) relative to subjects with little or no preexisting IgM for BG-Atri. This survival correlation was specific to vaccine treatment, as no correlation was observed in control patients immunized with wild-type poxviruses lacking the key tumor antigen, prostate-specific antigen (PSA). Moreover, anti-BG-Atri IgM levels were not correlated with general measures of disease severity, such as PSA levels, Gleason score, or Halabi predicted survival.  Conclusion:   In addition to reporting a new potentially predictive biomarker for PROSTVAC-VF, this study highlights the use of glycan microarray technology for improving our understanding of vaccine immunology.

The prostate is bombarded by numerous infectious and inflammatory insults over a lifetime. Chronic inflammation is associated with CXCL12, CCL5, and CCL2, which are highly overexpressed in prostate cancer. Among other cell types, these chemoattractant stimuli recruit BM-MSCs to the tumor. MSCs are minimally defined as plastic-adhering cells characterized by the expression of CD90, CD73, and CD105 in the absence of hematopoietic markers, which can differentiate into osteoblasts, chondrocytes, and adipocytes. MSCs are immunoprivileged and have been implicated in tumorigenesis through multiple mechanisms, including promoting proliferation, angiogenesis, and metastasis, in addition to the generation of an immunosuppressive microenvironment. We have demonstrated that MSCs represent 0.01-1.1% of the total cells present in core biopsies from primary human prostatectomies. Importantly, these analyses were performed on samples prior to expansion in tissue culture. MSCs in these prostatectomy samples are FAP-, CD90-, CD73-, and CD105-positive, and CD14-, CD20-, CD34-, CD45-, and HLA-DR-negative. Additionally, like BM-MSCs, these prostate cancer-derived stromal cells (PrCSCs) were shown to differentiate into osteoblasts, adipocytes and chondrocytes. In contrast to primary prostate cancer-derived epithelial cells, fluorescently-labeled PrCSCs and BM-MSCs were both shown to home to CWR22RH prostate cancer xenografts following IV injection. These studies demonstrate that not only are MSCs present in sites of prostate cancer where they may contribute to carcinogenesis, but these cells may also potentially be used to deliver cytotoxic or imaging agents for therapeutic and/or diagnostic purposes.""","""['W Nathaniel Brennen', 'Shuangling Chen', 'Samuel R Denmeade', 'John T Isaacs']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell-Derived Mesenchymal Stromal Cells Are Functionally and Genetically Different From Bone Marrow-Derived Mesenchymal Stromal Cells.', 'Mesenchymal stem cells as a vector for the inflammatory prostate microenvironment.', 'The expression of neurogenic markers after neuronal induction of chorion-derived mesenchymal stromal cells.', 'Human mesenchymal stem cell proliferation and osteogenic differentiation during long-term ex vivo cultivation is not age dependent.', 'Commonly used mesenchymal stem cell markers and tracking labels: Limitations and challenges.', 'Fibroblasts as Turned Agents in Cancer Progression.', 'Early Cell Cultures from Prostate Cancer Tissue Express Tissue Specific Epithelial and Cancer Markers.', 'Carcinoma-Associated Mesenchymal Stem/Stromal Cells: Architects of the Pro-tumorigenic Tumor Microenvironment.', 'Allogeneic vs. autologous mesenchymal stem/stromal cells in their medication practice.', 'Mesenchymal stem cell-derived interleukin-28 drives the selection of apoptosis resistant bone metastatic prostate cancer.']"""

Thirty prostatic samples were taken from 60- to 90-year-old patients without prostatic lesions and with low-grade cancer and high-grade cancer, from the University Hospital, School of Medicine, the State University of Campinas. The results showed that increased FGF-2, FGF-7, and FGF-8 receptor reactivities and decreased AR reactivity were verified in both high- and low-grade cancer. However, the FGF-8 receptor showed greater involvement at the beginning of the malignancy alterations. Increased EGF receptor (EGFR) reactivity and diminished α-actin immunohistochemistry were identified in both cancer groups. Also, increased ERα, PR, and vimentin receptors were verified in both cancer groups. To conclude, the ERα involvement in the reactive stroma activation led to a microenvironment, which was favorable to cancer progression, due to maximizing stromal imbalance. The prolactin could be related to cancer progression due to its interaction with ERα action, indicating that this hormone could be a relevant target to prevent the estrogenic effects in the prostatic lesions. Both FGF receptor (FGFR)-2 and FGFR-8 play a fundamental role in the early stages of prostate cancer, suggesting that these molecules could be a promising therapeutic target.

KX2-391 is a synthetic, orally bioavailable small molecule inhibitor of Src tyrosine kinase (TK) signaling and tubulin polymerization. This compound is distinct from other Src kinase inhibitors by targeting the peptide substrate rather than the ATP binding site; the binding site on hetero-dimeric tubulin is novel and distinct from the taxanes and other known tubulin inhibitors.  Methods:   This multicenter Phase I trial utilized a 4 + 2 study design to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), safety, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of KX2-391 in patients with refractory solid tumors.  Results:   Forty-four (44) patients (18 M, 26 F; median age, 59) were enrolled in 9 dose cohorts. Dose-limiting toxicities, all reversible within 7 days, occurred in 7 patients and consisted of elevated AST (n = 4), ALT (n = 2), neutropenia (n = 1), thrombocytopenia (n = 1), failure to thrive (n = 1) and anorexia (n = 1).

However, manual scoring systems are time-consuming and subject to significant intra- and interobserver variability. The aim of our study was to explore, whether new image analysis software proves to be sufficient as an alternative tool to quantify protein expression. For IHC experiments, one nucleus specific marker (i.e., ERG antibody), one cytoplasmic specific marker (i.e., SLC45A3 antibody), and one marker expressed in both compartments (i.e., TMPRSS2 antibody) were chosen. Stainings were applied on TMAs, containing tumor material of 630 prostate cancer patients. A pathologist visually quantified all IHC stainings in a blinded manner, applying a four-step scoring system. For digital quantification, image analysis software (Tissue Studio v.2.1, Definiens AG, Munich, Germany) was applied to obtain a continuous spectrum of average staining intensity. For each of the three antibodies we found a strong correlation of the manual protein expression score and the score of the image analysis software. Spearman's rank correlation coefficient was 0.94, 0.92, and 0.90 for ERG, SLC45A3, and TMPRSS2, respectively (p⟨0.01).

The association of haematuria with age, pretreatment PSA, ethnicity, clinical tumour stage, Gleason score, prostate volume, isotope (iodine 125 or palladium 103), biologically effective dose (BED), external beam radiation, androgen deprivation, development of urinary retention and occurrence of biochemical failure was investigated.  Results:   A total of 218 men (8.9%) reported gross haematuria at a median time of 772.2 days after implantation.

AND WHAT DOES THE STUDY ADD?: There is increasing evidence that the receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand (RANKL) pathway not only contributes to the development of bone metastases, but also influences tumour biology in earlier stages of cancer. The study shows that preoperative serum levels of RANKL and its inhibitor osteoprotegerin (OPG) have a prognostic impact in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy for clinically localized prostate cancer. Both high levels of RANKL and a higher RANKL/OPG ratio are independent predictors of early biochemical recurrence in these patients.  Objective:   To assess the prognostic impact of proteins of the receptor activator of nuclear factor κB (RANKL) pathway in serum samples from patients undergoing radical prostatectomy.  Patients and methods:   We retrospectively determined soluble RANKL (sRANKL) and osteoprotegerin (OPG) by ELISA in serum samples of 178 patients undergoing radical prostatectomy between 2004 and 2006. Clinical and patient follow-up data were analysed using the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test, the Kaplan-Maier method, and single variable or multifactorial Cox proportional hazards analysis.  Results:   Higher serum sRANKL levels (P = 0.01), lower serum OPG levels (P = 0.01) and a higher sRANKL/OPG ratio (P = 0.004) were significant risk factors for biochemical recurrence (BCR). In multifactorial analysis, adjusted for the common risk factors for BCR, sRANKL and sRANKL/OPG ratio were confirmed as independent prognostic factors. Neither sRANKL nor OPG showed a clear association with histopathological factors such as pT stage, pN Gleason score or resection margin status, nor were they associated with prostate-specific antigen level.  Conclusions:   Greater activity of the RANKL pathway in the serum of patients with prostate cancer undergoing radical prostatectomy is a risk factor for BCR.

Using a cell line from bone metastasis of prostate cancer (PC3), we analyzed how prostate cancer cells migrate in a physiologically relevant 3D Matrigel. We found that PC3 cells migrated more efficiently as multi-cellular clusters than isolated single cells, suggesting that the presence of cell-cell adhesion improves 3D cell migration. Perturbation of N-cadherin function by transfection of either the N-cadherin cytoplasmic domain or shRNA specific to N-cadherin abolished collective cell migration. Interestingly, PC3 cells do not express α-catenin, an actin binding protein in the cadherin complex. When the full-length α-catenin was re-introduced, the phenotype of PC3 cells reverted back to a more epithelial phenotype with a decreased cell migration rate in 3D Matrigel. Interestingly, we found that the N-terminal half of α-catenin was sufficient to suppress invasive phenotype. Taken together, these data suggest that the formation of N-cadherin junctions promotes 3D cell migration of prostate cancer cells, and this is partly due to an aberrant regulation of the N-cadherin complex in the absence of α-catenin.""","""['Yuanyuan Cui', 'Soichiro Yamada']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Chromosome 5 suppresses tumorigenicity of PC3 prostate cancer cells: correlation with re-expression of alpha-catenin and restoration of E-cadherin function.', 'Reduction of E-cadherin levels and deletion of the alpha-catenin gene in human prostate cancer cells.', 'N-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion promotes cell migration in a three-dimensional matrix.', 'Biochemical and structural analysis of alpha-catenin in cell-cell contacts.', ""Cinderella no longer: alpha-catenin steps out of cadherin's shadow."", 'In Vitro and In Silico Analysis of Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition and Cancer Stemness as Prognostic Markers of Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma.', 'Pacsin 2-dependent N-cadherin internalization regulates the migration behaviour of malignant cancer cells.', 'Prostate cancer bone metastases biology and clinical management (Review).', 'The metastatic capacity of high-grade serous ovarian cancer cells changes along disease progression: inhibition by mifepristone.', 'Prostate cancer cells of increasing metastatic potential exhibit diverse contractile forces, cell stiffness, and motility in a microenvironment stiffness-dependent manner.']"""

Methods:   We have undertaken a transcriptomic analysis of gene expression differences between the androgen-dependent LNCaP parental cells and its castration-resistant Abl and Hof sublines, revealing 1,660 genes associated with castration-resistance.

Methods:   Canine PSMA cDNA was isolated by PCR, cloned into expression vectors and transfected into COS-1 and MDCK cells.

Results:   Canine PSMA shows 91% amino acid homology to human PSMA, whereby the major difference is a longer cytoplasmic tail of canine PSMA compared to its human counterpart. Canine PSMA is trafficked efficiently along the secretory pathway, undergoes homodimerization when it acquires complex glycosylated mature form. It associates with detergent-resistant membranes, which act as platforms along its intracellular trafficking.

Prostate cancer mortality is primarily attributed to development of metastases rather than primary, organ-confined disease. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a key regulator of angiogenesis in prostate tissue. Our previous studies have demonstrated that the chemopreventive bioflavonoid apigenin inhibited hypoxia-induced elevation of VEGF production at low oxygen conditions characteristic for solid tumors. Low oxygen (hypoxia) and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) are two major factors responsible for increased VEGF secretion. In the present study, experiments were performed to investigate the inhibitory effect of apigenin on TGF-β-induced VEGF production and the mechanisms underlying this action. Our results demonstrate that VEGF expression is induced by TGF-β1 in human prostate cancer PC3-M and LNCaP C4-2B cells, and treatment with apigenin markedly decreased VEGF production. Additionally, apigenin inhibited TGF-β1-induced phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of Smad2 and Smad3. Further experiments demonstrated that specific transient knockdown of Smad2 or Smad3 blunted apigenin's effect on VEGF expression. We also found that apigenin inhibited Src, FAK, and Akt phosphorylation in PC3-M and LNCaP C4-2B cells. Furthermore, constitutively active Src reversed the inhibitory effect of apigenin on VEGF expression and Smad2/3 phosphorylation. Taken together, our results suggest that apigenin inhibits prostate carcinogenesis by modulating TGF-β-activated pathways linked to cancer progression and metastases, in particular the Smad2/3 and Src/FAK/Akt pathways. These findings provide new insights into molecular pathways targeted by apigenin, and reveal a novel molecular mechanism underlying the antiangiogenic potential of apigenin.""","""['Salida Mirzoeva', 'Carrie A Franzen', 'Jill C Pelling']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Mol Carcinog""","""['Inhibition of HIF-1 alpha and VEGF expression by the chemopreventive bioflavonoid apigenin is accompanied by Akt inhibition in human prostate carcinoma PC3-M cells.', 'The chemopreventive bioflavonoid apigenin inhibits prostate cancer cell motility through the focal adhesion kinase/Src signaling mechanism.', 'Opposite functions of HIF-α isoforms in VEGF induction by TGF-β1 under non-hypoxic conditions.', 'A tale of two proteins: differential roles and regulation of Smad2 and Smad3 in TGF-beta signaling.', 'Growth factors involved in prostate carcinogenesis.', 'Biomolecules Involved in Both Metastasis and Placenta Accreta Spectrum-Does the Common Pathophysiological Pathway Exist?', 'Phytochemical Constituents and Derivatives of Cannabis sativa; Bridging the Gap in Melanoma Treatment.', 'Recent updates on anticancer mechanisms of polyphenols.', 'Role of Nrf2, STAT3, and Src as Molecular Targets for Cancer Chemoprevention.', 'Phytochemicals in Inhibition of Prostate Cancer: Evidence from Molecular Mechanisms Studies.']"""

Physiological and pathological factors have been shown to influence the %fPSA value and diagnostic accuracy.  Materials/methods:   To evaluate genetic determinants of %fPSA, we conducted a genome-wide association study of serum %fPSA by genotyping 642,584 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 3192 men of European ancestry, each with a tPSA level of 2.5 to 10 ng/ml, that were recruited in the REduction by DUtasteride of Prostate Cancer Events study. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with P < 10(-5) were further evaluated among the controls of a population-based case-control study in Sweden (2899 prostate cancer cases and 1722 male controls), including 464 controls having tPSA levels of 2.5 to 10 ng/ml.  Results:   We identified two loci that were associated with %fPSA at a genome-wide significance level (P <5 x 10(-8)). The first associated SNP was rs3213764 (P = 6.45 x 10(-10)), a nonsynonymous variant (K530R) in the ATF7IP gene at 12p13. This variant was also nominally associated with tPSA (P = .015). The second locus was rs1354774 (P = 1.25 x 10(-12)), near KLK2 at 19q13, which was not associated with tPSA levels, and is separate from the rs17632542 locus at KLK3 that was previously associated with tPSA levels and prostate cancer risk.

The ability of β1 to promote resistance to radiation was also analyzed by using an inhibitory antibody to β1 , AIIB2, in a xenograft model. The role of β1 integrins and of a β1 downstream target, c-Jun amino-terminal kinase 1 (JNK1), in regulating radiation-induced apoptosis in vivo and in vitro was studied. We show that β1 integrins promote prostate cancer (PrCa) progression and resistance to radiation in vivo. Mechanistically, β1 integrins are shown here to suppress activation of JNK1 and, consequently apoptosis, in response to irradiation. Downregulation of JNK1 is necessary to preserve the effect of β1 on resistance to radiation in vitro and in vivo. Finally, given the established crosstalk between β1 integrins and type1 insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-IR), we analyzed the ability of IGF-IR to modulate β1 integrin levels.

Acute toxicity was scored according to RTOG/EORTC toxicity extended criteria after completing a 22-item questionnaire (basal, weekly, at 6 months).  Results:   Minimum and median follow-up were 36 and 54.2 months, respectively. GU toxicity grades 0, 1, 2 and 3 were found in 30.4, 37, 32 and 0.6 % of patients, respectively. The figures for grades 0, 1, 2 and 3 GI toxicity were 66, 24, 10 and 0 %. The highest degree of acute reactions was reached at 4-5 weeks. At 6 months, 15 % of patients had GU toxicity (11 % grade 1, 4 % grade 2) and 5.8 % GI toxicity (5.3 % grade 1, 0.5 % grade 2). Multivariate analysis shows that bladder volume receiving ≥65 Gy (V 65) is associated with an increased risk of GU complications (p = 0.017, HR = 1.143, 95 % CI = 1.025-1.276), while history of TURP is linked to lower risk (p = 0.002, HR = 0.310, 95 % CI 0.004-0.370).

Despite the large number of patients treated with postoperative RT, some issues about optimal technique, doses, volumes, timing and association with androgen deprivation are still subject of debate. The aim of this survey was to determine the patterns of choice of Italian radiation oncologists in two different clinical cases of postoperative prostate cancer patients.  Study design:   During the 2010 National Congress of the Italian Association of Radiation Oncology (AIRO), four clinical cases were presented to the attending radiation oncologists. Two of them were cases of postoperative prostate cancer, differing in T stage of the primary tumour according to the TNM classification, preoperative staging procedures, preoperative PSA (iPSA), Gleason score of biopsies and definitive pathological specimen after surgery and postoperative PSA. For each clinical case, the radiation oncologists were asked to: (a) give indication to new pre-treatment procedures for staging; b) give indication to postoperative treatment; (c) to define specifically, where indicated, the total dose, type of fractionation, treatment volumes, type of technique, type of image-guided setup control; (d) indicate whether adjuvant hormonal therapy should be prescribed; (e) define criteria that mostly influenced the prescription. A descriptive statistical analysis was then performed.  Results:   A total of 300 questionnaires were distributed amongst radiation oncologists attending the congress; 128 were completed and considered for this analysis (41%). Some important differences were shown in prescribing and performing postoperative radiotherapy, and some significant differences with international guidelines and data available from the literature were also reviewed and discussed.

Inhibition of CYP24A1 enhances 1,25D(3) antitumor activity. To isolate regulators of CYP24A1 expression in prostate cancer cells, we established a stable prostate cancer cell line PC3 with CYP24A1 promoter driving luciferase expression to screen a small molecular library for compounds that inhibit CYP24A1 promoter activity. From this screening, we identified, 4,5,6,7-tetrabromobenzimidazole (TBBz), a protein kinase CK2 selective inhibitor as a disruptor of CYP24A1 promoter activity. We show that TBBz inhibits CYP24A1 promoter activity induced by 1,25D(3) in prostate cancer cells. In addition, TBBz downregulates endogenous CYP24A1 mRNA level in TBBz-treated PC3 cells.

Heat-shock-protein-90 (Hsp90), an integral member of this machinery, is a molecular chaperone required for energy-driven stabilization and selective degradation of misfolded ""client"" proteins, that is commonly overexpressed in tumor cells. Hsp90 client proteins include critical components of pathways implicated in prostate cancer cell survival and radioresistance, such as androgen receptor signaling and the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway. We examined the effects of a novel non-geldanamycin Hsp90 inhibitor, AUY922, combined with radiation (RT) on two prostate cancer cell lines, Myc-CaP and PC3, using in vitro assays for clonogenic survival, apoptosis, cell cycle distribution, γ-H2AX foci kinetics and client protein expression in pathways important for prostate cancer survival and radioresistance. We then evaluated tumor growth delay and effects of the combined treatment (RT-AUY922) on the PI3K-Akt-mTOR and AR pathways in a hind-flank tumor graft model. We observed that AUY922 caused supra-additive radiosensitization in both cell lines at low nanomolar doses with enhancement ratios between 1.4-1.7 (p < 0.01). RT-AUY922 increased apoptotic cell death compared with either therapy alone, induced G 2-M arrest and produced marked changes in client protein expression. These results were confirmed in vivo, where RT-AUY922 combination therapy produced supra-additive tumor growth delay compared with either therapy by itself in Myc-CaP and PC3 tumor grafts (both p < 0.0001).

These skeletal metastases cause a number of debilitating complications and are refractory to current treatments. New therapeutic options are being explored, including conditionally replicating adenoviruses (CRAds). CRAds are engineered to selectively replicate in and destroy tumor cells and can be 'armed' with exogenous transgenes for enhanced potency. We hypothesized that a CRAd armed with osteoprotegerin (OPG), an inhibitor of osteoclastogenesis, would inhibit the progression of prostate cancer bone metastases by directly lysing tumor cells and by reducing osteoclast activity. Although prostate cancer bone metastases are predominantly osteoblastic in nature, increased osteoclast activity is critical for the growth of these lesions. Ad5-Δ24-sOPG-Fc-RGD is a CRAd that carries a fusion of the ligand-binding domains of OPG and the Fc region of human IgG1 in place of the viral E3B genes. To circumvent low tumor cell expression of the native adenoviral receptor, an arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) peptide insertion within the viral fiber knob allows infection of cells expressing α(v) integrins. A 24-base pair deletion (Δ24) within viral E1A limits replication to cells with aberrant retinoblastoma cell cycle regulator/tumor suppressor expression. We have confirmed that Ad5-Δ24-sOPG-Fc-RGD replicates within and destroys prostate cancer cells and, in both murine and human coculture models, that infection of prostate cancer cells inhibits osteoclastogenesis in vitro.

Objective:   The objective of this study was to examine and understand the supportive care needs of men diagnosed and treated for prostate cancer at key identifiable periods of their cancer journey.  Methods:   An international Web-based survey was conducted in 2012, investigating men's prostate cancer pathways. The survey was based on substantial qualitative research and assessed for validity and reliability before piloting. To provide a unique insight into men living with prostate cancer, the views of partners were also elicited.  Results:   Completed questionnaires were obtained from 193 men and 40 partners from 6 nations. The physical and psychosocial impact of treatment and need for support varied along the cancer journey. Fear, distress, loss, regret, anxiety, low self-esteem, depression, changes in sexuality, masculinity, and relationships were also described by both men and partners as adverse effects of the diagnosis and treatment for prostate cancer.  Conclusions:   Wives and partners are a key psychosocial support to men with prostate cancer. They may also provide valuable insight into men's supportive care needs that men are often unable to recognize themselves.

Design, setting, and participants:   Between September 2007 and March 2012, 103 patients participated in the Prostate Cancer Research International Active Surveillance (PRIAS) QoL study. Mental health (Symptom Checklist-90), demographic, clinical, and decisional data were assessed at entrance in AS.

Results and limitations:   The mean age of the study patients was 67 yr (standard deviation: ±7 yr). Lack of partner (odds ratio [OR]: 0.08; p=0.009) and impaired mental health (OR: 1.2, p=0.1) were associated with low HRQoL (p=0.006; area under the curve [AUC]: 0.72).

There are conflicting recommendations for HIFU among urological societies, which can be explained by the lack of prospective controlled studies, reports on preselected patient populations and limited follow-up providing little information on overall and cancer-specific survival. We report on a large, unselected consecutive patient series of patients who have undergone primary HIFU for clinically localized PCa with the longest follow-up in current literature. Our results improve the understanding of the oncological efficacy, morbidity and side effects of primary HIFU.  Objective:   To assess the safety, functional and oncological long-term outcomes of high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) as a primary treatment option for localized prostate cancer (PCa).  Patients and methods:   We conducted a retrospective single-centre study on 538 consecutive patients who underwent primary HIFU for clinically localized PCa between November 1997 and September 2009. Factors assessed were: biochemical disease-free survival (BDFS) according to Phoenix criteria (prostate-specific antigen nadir + 2 ng/mL); metastatic-free, overall and PCa-specific survival; salvage treatment; side effects; potency; and continence status.  Results:   The mean (sd; range) follow-up was 8.1 (2.9; 2.1-14.0) years. The actuarial BDFS rates at 5 and 10 years were 81 and 61%, respectively.

Metastatic disease was reported in 0.4, 5.7 and 15.4% of low-, intermediate- and high-risk patients, respectively. The salvage treatment rate was 18%. Seventy-five (13.9%) patients died. PCa-specific death was registered in 18 (3.3%) patients (0, 3.8 and 11% in the low-, intermediate- and high-risk groups, respectively). Side effects included bladder outlet obstruction (28.3%), Grade I, II and III stress urinary incontinence (13.8, 2.4 and 0.7%, respectively) and recto-urethral fistula (0.7%). Preserved potency was 25.4% (in previously potent patients).  Conclusions:   The study demonstrates the efficacy and safety of HIFU for localized PCa.

AND WHAT DOES THE STUDY ADD?: In a recent rtMRI study, we were able to show that, during initiation of voiding, there was both funnelling of the bladder neck and simultaneous contraction of the ventral prostate. We presumed that the vertical contraction of the ventral prostate contributes to the initiation of successful micturition. The question remained as to whether this shortening of the ventral prostate is predominantly caused by contractile elements in the organ itself, or by surrounding contractile elements of the pelvic floor. In our study we provide insight in to anatomical changes, and biometric and functional analysis of the prostate during micturition. A sagittal contraction of the ventral prostate and the longitudinal smooth muscle elements at the onset of voiding, which can be observed on MRI, is likely to shorten and open up the prostatic urethra.  Objective:   To investigate if in vitro contractile strength of the prostate and the prostatic urethra might correlate with the shortening of the ventral prostate seen on real-time magnetic resonance imaging (rtMRI). Micturition is a complex process that includes anatomical and neurological interactions for successful voiding. Recently we described on rtMRI that vertical contraction of the ventral prostate precedes initiation of male micturition and may contribute to the funnelling of the bladder neck.  Patients and methods:   In all, 10 patients undergoing radical prostatectomy (RP) were enrolled. Approval was obtained from all patients and by the local Ethics Committee. Preoperative rtMRI during voiding was performed as described before in eight patients undergoing RP, measuring the difference of the cranio-caudal distance of the ventral prostate (VP). To roughly estimate the amount of force required to deform the prostate in a vertical direction as seen on rtMRI, we uniaxially compressed the organ immediately after surgery by the same distance, assuming incompressibility and isotropy of prostatic tissue. A muscle strip (3 × 3 mm) from the ventral prostate, dorsal prostate and prostatic urethra was obtained after pathological evaluation. Contraction was elicited by electrical-field stimulation (EFS: 0.1 ms pulses at 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 and 64 Hz for 4 s).  Results:   There was a mean cranio-caudal contraction of the ventral prostate by 7.6 mm at the onset of micturition on rtMRI (P = 0.002). The mean (sd) contractile force of strips elicited by EFS at 32 Hz was 1472.44 (706.88) mN for the ventral prostate, 1044.24 (894.66) mN for the dorsal prostate, and 639.10 (785.06) mN for the prostatic urethra (P = 0.02). Extrapolating these values to the whole organ diameter, we calculated comparable force as observed in compression experiments.  Conclusions:   Our functional and biometric in vitro analyses of prostate tissue showed sufficient contractile strength of the ventral prostate to induce a shortening of the organ as seen on rtMRI. There was significant higher contractile strength in the ventral prostate than in the dorsal prostate or the proximal urethra. The consistency of in vivo and in vitro results underlines the significance of the ventral prostate for the initiation of normal micturition.""","""['Yasemin Hocaoglu', 'Karin Herrmann', 'Sebastian Walther', 'Martin Hennenberg', 'Christian Gratzke', 'Ricarda Bauer', 'Christian Stief', 'Alexander Roosen']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Real-time magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): anatomical changes during physiological voiding in men.', 'Urethral afferent nerve activity affects the micturition reflex; implication for the relationship between stress incontinence and detrusor instability.', 'Impact of variations in prostatic apex shape on early recovery of urinary continence after radical retropubic prostatectomy.', 'Continence and micturition: an anatomical basis.', 'Voiding dysfunction in prostate cancer.', 'Anterior fibromuscular stroma-preserved endoscopic enucleation of the prostate: a precision anatomical approach.', 'Imaging for urinary incontinence.', 'Whole prostate volume and shape changes with the use of an inflatable and flexible endorectal coil.', 'Is a wider angle of the membranous urethra associated with incontinence after radical prostatectomy?', 'Etiology and pathophysiology of benign prostate hyperplasia.']"""

In this study we aimed to investigate ten newly synthesized BZT derivatives as potential anti-tumour agents against prostate cancer in vitro and in vivo.  Methods:   The cytotoxic effect of these compounds was screened on the human prostate cancer cell lines PC-3 and LNCaP. The most effective compound, N'-formyl-2-(5-nitrothiophen-2-yl)benzothiazole-6-carbohydrazide, was further characterized regarding its dose- and time-dependent effects on cell viability and proliferation (XTT test) as well as on adhesion and spreading (real-time cell analyzer xCelligence), migration (scratch-wound repair assay) and invasion (Boyden chamber) of the cells. This BZT derivative was also tested as an inhibitor of angiogenesis (chicken chorioallantoic membrane assay), clonogenic activity (soft agar) and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (gelatin zymography).  Key findings:   N'-Formyl-2-(5-nitrothiophen-2-yl)benzothiazole-6-carbohydrazide significantly inhibited all tested properties of the prostate cancer cell lines and showed low toxic in vitro and in vivo effects. The in vitro anti-tumour activity of this compound was confirmed by the in vivo effects on PC-3 xenografts in nude mice. Tumour growth was decreased in treated compared with untreated mice.

AND WHAT DOES THE STUDY ADD?: The occurence of lymphoceles in patients after radical prostatectomy is well known (2-10%). It appears that patients undergoing open extraperitoneal radical prostatectomy develop more lymphoceles than patients undergoing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy with transperitoneal access. The present study investigates in a prospective randomized manner whether the time of drainage (1 vs 7 days) makes a difference or whether drainage is even necessary. The study data, collected in the same institution, are compared with the incidence of lymphocele in patients treated by robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.  Objective:   To investigate whether routine drainage is advisable after open extended pelvic lymph node dissection (ePLND) and retropubic radical prostatectomy (RRP) by measuring the incidence of lymphoceles and comparing these results with those of a series of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) and ePLND.  Patients and methods:   A total of 331 consecutive patients underwent ePLND and RRP or RARP. The first 132 patients underwent open ePLND and RRP and received two pelvic drains; these patients were prospectively randomized into two groups: group 1 (n = 66), in which the drains were shortened on postoperative (PO) days 3 and 5 and removed on PO day 7, and group 2 (n = 66), in which the drains were removed on PO day 1. The next 199 patients were assigned to two consecutive groups not receiving drainage: group 3 (n = 73) undergoing open ePLND and RRP, followed by group 4 (n = 126) treated by transperitoneal robot-assisted ePLND and RARP. All patients had ultrasonographic controls 5 and 10 days and 3 and 12 months after surgery.  Results:   Lymphoceles were detected in 6.6% of all patients, 3.3% of whom were asymptomatic and 3.3% of whom were symptomatic. Symptomatic lymphoceles were detected in 0% of group 1, 8% of group 2, 7% of group 3 and 1% of group 4, with groups 2 and 3 differing significantly from group 4 (P < 0.05). In total, 5% of all patients undergoing open RRP (groups 1-3) had symptomatic lymphoceles vs 1% of patients undergoing RARP (group 4) (P = 0.06). Nodal-positive patients had significantly more symptomatic lymphoceles than nodal-negative patients (10% vs 2%) (P < 0.02).  Conclusions:   Symptomatic lymphoceles occur less frequently after open RRP and pelvic drainage over 7 days than after open RRP and pelvic drainage over 1 day or without drainage.

Methods:   We reviewed patients who underwent radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer by high volume surgeons performing RALP or ORP. Biochemical recurrence (BCR) was defined as PSA ≥ 0.1 ng/mL or PSA ≥ 0.05 ng/mL with receipt of additional therapy. A Cox regression model was used to evaluate the association between surgical approach and BCR using a predictive model (nomogram) based on preoperative stage, grade, volume of disease and PSA. To explore the impact of differences between surgeons, multivariable analyses were repeated using surgeon in place of approach.  Results:   Of 1454 patients included, 961 (66%) underwent ORP and 493 (34%) RALP and there were no important differences in cancer characteristics by group. Overall, 68% of patients met National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) criteria for intermediate or high risk disease and 9% had lymph node involvement. Positive margin rates were 15% for both open and robotic groups. In a multivariate model adjusting for preoperative risk there was no significant difference in BCR rates for RALP compared with ORP (hazard ratio 0.88; 95% CI 0.56-1.39; P = 0.6). The interaction term between nomogram risk and procedure type was not statistically significant. Using NCCN risk group as the covariate in a Cox model gave similar results (hazard ratio 0.74; 95% CI 0.47-1.17; P = 0.2). The interaction term between NCCN risk and procedure type was also non-significant. Differences in BCR rates between techniques (4.1% vs 3.3% adjusted risk at 2 years) were smaller than those between surgeons (2.5% to 4.8% adjusted risk at 2 years).  Conclusions:   In this relatively high risk cohort of patients undergoing radical prostatectomy we found no evidence to suggest that ORP resulted in better early oncological outcomes then RALP.

This decision rule could be used after initial PC screening, providing the patient and clinician information to consider prior to biopsy.  Methods:   This case-control study evaluated men from the Tampa, Florida, James A. Haley (JH) Veteran's Administration (VA) (N = 1,378), from January 1, 1998, through April 15, 2005. To assess the PBCDR we did all of the following: 1) Identified biomarkers that are related to PC and have the capability of improving the efficiency of PC screening; 2) Developed statistical models to determine which can best predict the probability of PC; 3) Compared each potential model to PSA alone using Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) curves, to evaluate for improved overall effectiveness in PC detection and reduction in (negative) biopsies; and 4) Evaluated dose-response relationships between specified lab biomarkers (surrogates for extra-prostatic disease development) and PC progression.  Results:   The following biomarkers were related to PC: hemoglobin (HGB) (OR = 1.42 95% CI 1.27, 1.59); red blood cell (RBC) count (OR = 2.52 95% CI 1.67, 3.78); PSA (OR = 1.04 95% CI 1.03, 1.05); and, creatinine (OR = 1.55 95% CI 1.12, 2.15). Comparing all PC stages versus non-cancerous conditions, the ROC curve area under the curve (AUC) enlarged (increasing the probability of correctly classifying PC): PSA (alone) 0.59 (95% CI 0.55, 0.61); PBCDR model 0.68 (95% CI 0.65, 0.71), and the positive predictive value (PPV) increased: PSA 44.7%; PBCDR model 61.8%. Comparing PC (stages II, III, IV) vs. other, the ROC AUC increased: PSA (alone) 0.63 (95% CI 0.58, 0.66); PBCDR model 0.72 (95% CI 0.68, 0.75), and the PPV increased: 20.6% (PSA); PBCDR model 55.3%.  Conclusions:   These results suggest evaluating certain common biomarkers in conjunction with PSA may improve PC prediction prior to biopsy. Moreover, these biomarkers may be more helpful in detecting clinically relevant PC.

AND WHAT DOES THE STUDY ADD?: Although lymph node dissection (LND) is known as the most accurate method of nodal staging, the therapeutic role of LND remains undetermined. This is mainly because of the lack of randomized prospective studies and the fact that retrospective analyses often result in bias and misinterpretation. To overcome the limitation of retrospective analysis, we matched preoperative variables using propensity scores and compared the outcomes between patients treated with robot-assisted eLND and sLND. In the matched cohort, robot-asssited eLND achieved an increased detection rate of lymph node metastases; however, the therapeutic benefit was not statistically significant between the two groups on short-term follow-up.  Objective:   To compare the pathological and biochemical outcomes between extended lymph node dissection (eLND) and standard lymph node dissection (sLND) in patients undergoing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy for intermediate- or high-risk prostate cancer.  Patients and methods:   A total of 905 patients underwent robot-assisted radical prostatectomy and lymph node dissection (LND) by a single surgeon between June 2006 and January 2011. Of these, 170 patients who underwent robot-assisted eLND and 294 patients who underwent robot-assisted sLND for intermediate- or high-risk prostate cancer were included in the study. Propensity-score matching was performed using the preoperative variables which included age, body mass index, prostate-specific antigen, clinical stage, biopsy Gleason score 1 and 2, total number of biopsied cores, number of positive cores and prostate volumes. Pathological and biochemical outcomes were assessed according to the extent of LND.  Results:   The median (range) follow-up period was 36 (12-77) months and the median number of lymph nodes removed was 21 and 12 in the eLND and sLND groups, respectively. Propensity-score matching resulted in 141 patients in each group. Although patients who underwent eLND had a higher clinical stage, biopsy Gleason score and number of positive cores than those treated with sLND in the entire cohort, there were no preoperative between-group differences in the matched cohort. In the matched cohort, lymph node metastases were detected at a significantly higher rate in the eLND than in the sLND group (12.1 vs. 5.0%, P = 0.033). In the matched cohort, the 3-year biochemical recurrence-free survival rates were 77.8 and 73.5% in the eLND and sLND groups, respectively, which was not significant (hazard ratio 0.85, P = 0.497).

Patients and methods:   In total, 913 patients with HRPC were identified in the Johns Hopkins Radical Prostatectomy Database subsequent to the inception of MIRP at this institution (2002-2011) Of these, 743 (81.4%) underwent open radical retropubic prostatectomy (ORRP), 105 (11.5%) underwent robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RALRP) and 65 (7.1%) underwent laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (LRP) for HRPC. Appropriate comparative tests were used to evaluate patient and prostate cancer characteristics. Proportional hazards regression models were used to predict biochemical recurrence.  Results:   Age, race, body mass index, preoperative PSA level, clinical stage, number of positive cores and Gleason score at final pathology were similar between ORRP and MIRP.

This progression model is supported by tissue culture and animal model studies, but it is difficult to reconcile with several well-established observations, principally among these are that up to 25% of early stage (Stage I/II), node-negative colorectal cancer (CRC) develop distant metastasis, and that circulating CRC cells are undetectable in peripheral blood samples of up to 50% of patients with confirmed metastasis, but more than 30% of patients with no detectable metastasis exhibit such cells. The mechanism responsible for this diverse behavior is unknown, and there are no effective means to identify patients with pending, or who are at high risk for, developing metastatic CRC.  Novel findings:   Our previous studies of human breast and prostate cancer have shown that cancer invasion arises from the convergence of a tissue injury, the innate immune response to that injury, and the presence of tumor stem cells within tumor capsules at the site of the injury. Focal degeneration of a capsule due to age or disease attracts lymphocyte infiltration that degrades the degenerating capsules resulting in the formation of a focal disruption in the capsule, which selectively favors proliferating or ""budding"" of the underlying tumor stem cells. Our recent studies suggest that lymphocyte infiltration also triggers metastasis by disrupting the intercellular junctions and surface adhesion molecules within the proliferating cell buds causing their dissociation. Then, lymphocytes and tumor cells are conjoined through membrane fusion to form tumor-lymphocyte chimeras (TLCs) that allows the tumor stem cell to avail itself of the lymphocyte's natural ability to migrate and breach cell barriers in order to intravasate and to travel to distant organs. Our most recent studies of human CRC have detected nearly identical focal capsule disruptions, lymphocyte infiltration, budding cells, and the formation of TLCs. Our studies have further shown that age- and type-matched node-positive and -negative CRC have a significantly different morphological and immunohistochemical profile and that the majority of lymphatic ducts with disseminated cells are located within the mucosa adjacent to morphologically normal appearing epithelial structures that express a stem cell-related marker.  New hypothesis:   Based on these findings and the growth patterns of budding cells revealed by double immunohistochemistry, we further hypothesize that metastatic spread is an early event of carcinogenesis and that budding cells overlying focal capsule disruptions represent invasion- and metastasis-initiating cells that follow one of four pathways to progress: (1) to undergo extensive in situ proliferation leading to the formation of tumor nests that subsequently invade the submucosa, (2) to migrate with associated lymphocytes functioning as ""seeds"" to grow in new sites, (3) to migrate and intravasate into pre-existing vascular structures by forming TLCs, or (4) to intravasate into vascular structures that are generated by the budding cells themselves. We also propose that only node-positive cases harbor stem cells with the potential for multi-lineage differentiation and unique surface markers that permit intravasation.""","""['Bin Jiang', 'Jeffrey Mason', 'Anahid Jewett', 'Jun Qian', 'Yijiang Ding', 'William C S Cho', 'Xichen Zhang', 'Yan-gao Man']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Int J Biol Sci""","""['Tumor-infiltrating immune cells: triggers for tumor capsule disruption and tumor progression?', 'Conjunction of tumor cells with lymphocytes: implications for tumor invasion and metastasis.', 'Focal degeneration of basal cells and the resultant auto-immunoreactions: a novel mechanism for prostate tumor progression and invasion.', 'Epithelial-mesenchymal transition in colorectal cancer metastasis: A system review.', 'Mechanisms of metastasis and molecular markers of malignant tumor progression.

A small body of work has identified links between attachment-a dispositional style of relating to others-and patterns of health care use. The current report examined how attachment characteristics predicted the frequency of digital rectal exam and prostate-specific antigen testing in a sample of African-descent men. Four hundred and fourteen African-descent men aged 45 to 70 years completed measures of prostate screening and attachment, together with measures of traditional predictors of screening (demographics, insurance, family history, physician variables, knowledge, perceived risk, and accessibility). Consistent with predictions, dismissiveness-the most common relational style among older men-predicted less frequent prostate-specific antigen testing and digital rectal examination. However, attachment security-a comfort with intimate relationships-also predicted lower screening frequency.

Although we had identified that microRNA(miR)-145 could repress bone metastasis of PCa via regulating epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in previous study, it is still unknown how miR-145 regulated EMT. In the present study, we constructed a luciferase reporter system and identified HEF1 as a direct target of miR-145. More importantly, HEF1 was shown to promote migration, invasion and EMT of PC-3 cells, a human PCa cell line originated from a bone metastatic PCa specimen. And HEF1 was also shown to partially mediate miR-145 suppression of EMT and invasion. Furthermore, inhibition of HEF1 repressed bone invasion of PC-3 cells in vivo. Expression of HEF1 was negatively correlated with miR-145 in primary PCa and bone metastatic specimens, but HEF1 was higher in samples which were more likely to commit to bone metastasis or those with higher free prostate-specific antigen (fPSA) levels and Gleason scores.

This is compounded by the use of androgen deprivation therapy, which causes dramatic falls in circulating testosterone and estrogen, resulting in rapid falls in bone density, decreased muscle mass, and increased fracture rates. Bisphosphonates have been demonstrated to prevent and reverse this bone loss, but there are no anti-fracture data. Denosumab, a monoclonal antibody to RANKL, has recently been shown to increase bone density and reduce fracture rates.

Here we showed by microarray and validation analyses that MT1h, a member of MT, is down-regulated in many human malignancies. Low expression of MT1h was associated with poor clinical outcomes in both prostate and liver cancer. We found that the promoter region of MT1h was hypermethylated in cancer and that demethylation of the MT1h promoter reversed the suppression of MT1h expression. Forced expression of MT1h induced cell growth arrest, suppressed colony formation, retarded migration, and reduced invasion. SCID mice with tumour xenografts with inducible MT1h expression had lower tumour volumes as well as fewer metastases and deaths than uninduced controls. MT1h was found to interact with euchromatin histone methyltransferase 1 (EHMT1) and enhanced its methyltransferase activity on histone 3. Knocking down of EHMT1 or a mutation in MT1h that abrogates its interaction with EHMT1 abrogated MT1h tumour suppressor activity.

MiR-182 and miR-203 were completely repressed during epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) from prostate epithelial EP156T cells to the progeny mesenchymal nontransformed EPT1 cells. Re-expression of miR-182 or miR-203 in EPT1 cells and prostate cancer PC3 cells induced mesenchymal to epithelial transition (MET) features. Simultaneously, miR-182 and miR-203 provided EPT1 cells with the ability to self-sufficiency of growth signals, a well-recognized oncogenic feature. Gene expression profiling showed high overlap of the genes affected by miR-182 and miR-203. SNAI2 was identified as a common target of miR-182 and miR-203. Knock-down of SNAI2 in EPT1 cells phenocopied re-expression of either miR-182 or miR-203 regarding both MET and self-sufficiency of growth signals. Strikingly, considerable overlaps of changed genes were found between the re-expression of miR-182/203 and knock-down of SNAI2. Finally, P-cadherin was identified as a direct target of SNAI2.

The decrease in apparent concentration from the traditionally merged sarcosine-alanine peak associated with the enzymatic elimination has been shown to be proportional to the total sarcosine present (R(2) = 0.9999), allowing for determinations of urinary sarcosine. Sarcosine oxidase was shown to eliminate only sarcosine in the presence of D,L-alanine, and was consequently used as the selective enzyme.

Methods:   We measured serum testosterone, estradiol, and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) by immunoassay in 134 males aged 12-19 in NHANES III. Mean concentrations were compared by race/ethnicity adjusting for age, Tanner stage, percent body fat, waist, physical activity, tobacco smoke, and the other hormones.  Results:   After multivariable adjustment, in the 12-15-year-old males, testosterone concentration was lower in non-Hispanic blacks than whites (p = 0.043), SHBG concentration did not significantly differ between the two groups. Mexican-Americans had the highest testosterone (versus non-Hispanic black: p = 0.002) and lowest SHBG (versus non-Hispanic white: p = 0.010; versus non-Hispanic black: p = 0.047) concentrations. Estradiol concentration was lower in non-Hispanic blacks (p = 0.11) and Mexican-Americans (p = 0.033) compared with non-Hispanic whites. After multivariable adjustment, in the 16-19-year-old males, testosterone, estradiol, and SHBG concentrations did not differ between non-Hispanic blacks and whites. Mexican-Americans had the highest testosterone concentration (versus non-Hispanic white: p = 0.08), but did not differ from the other groups on estradiol and SHBG concentrations. In both age groups, these patterns were generally present, but less pronounced after adjusting for age and Tanner stage only.

Recently, epidemiological studies have indicated that obesity correlates with an increased risk of developing ovarian cancer, the most lethal gynecological cancer in developed countries. Leptin is predominantly produced by adipocytes and acts as a growth factor and serum leptin levels positively correlate with the amount of body fat. In this study, we investigated the effects of leptin on the growth of ovarian cancer cells and the underlying mechanism(s) of action. Our results showed that leptin stimulated the growth of the OVCAR-3 ovarian cancer cell line using MTT assay and trypan blue exclusion. Using western blot analysis, we found that leptin enhanced the expression of cyclin D1 and Mcl-1, which are important regulators of cell proliferation and the inhibition of apoptosis. To investigate the signaling pathways that mediate the effects of leptin, cells were treated with leptin plus specific inhibitors of JAK2, PI3K/Akt and MEK/ERK1/2 and analysis of the phosphorylation state of proteins was carried out by western blot assays. We showed that the activation of the MEK/ERK1/2 and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways were involved in the growth-stimulating effect of leptin on ovarian cancer cell growth and the specific inhibitors of PI3K/Akt and MEK/ERK1/2 revealed that these two pathways interacted with each other.

In this study, we examined the effect of the interaction between obesity and miR-21, miR-221 or miR-222 expression on prostate cancer recurrence among 28 recurrent and 37 non-recurrent prostate cancer cases. miRNA expression was determined using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Cox proportional hazard models adjusting for age at diagnosis, clinical stage and Gleason score were used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for recurrence free survival. A significantly (P=0.014) higher proportion of recurrent cases (78.6%) than non-recurrent cases (48.6%) had a low expression of miR-21 and the difference was more prominent in obese than non-obese patients. Multivariate analysis showed that the expression of miR-21 was an independent risk factor for recurrence in obese (HR=6.15, 95% CI=1.04-36.48, P=0.045), but not in non-obese (HR=1.28, 95% CI=0.30-5.49, P=0.74) cases. A significant association with recurrence was not observed for the expression of miR-221 and miR-222. In summary, our findings show that miR-21 is associated with prostate cancer recurrence after radical prostatectomy and suggest that the differential expression of miR-21 is more prominent in obese than in non-obese cases.

At higher concentrations, curcumin induced ROS production leading to JNK and p38 phosphorylation in DU-145 prostate cancer cells. Of the MAP kinases, ERK or p38/JNK were phosphorylated earlier during curcumin treatment, and were responsible for curcumin-induced cell survival at early time of treatment with the help of phosphorylated Akt, while significant amounts of ROS production in later periods stimulated cell death with caspase degradation. In addition to autophagic signaling, necrosis was dominant with little apoptotic cell death. Caspase activation was completely prohibited by procaspase degradation, which contributed to curcumin-induced early necrosis. At the later incubation period (24h), cytotoxicity caused by curcumin peaked, at which time survival or proliferation signals, such as phosphorylated Akt and phosphorylated ERK, was almost completely diminished. Curcumin-induced ROS were shown to function, biphasically depending on the incubation period; facilitating survival, in the earlier incubation period, and necrotic death in the later.

We aimed to assess any effects on site-specific cancer rates in the randomised trials of folic acid supplementation, at doses higher than those from fortification.  Methods:   In these meta-analyses, we sought all trials completed before 2011 that compared folic acid versus placebo, had scheduled treatment duration at least 1 year, included at least 500 participants, and recorded data on cancer incidence. We obtained individual participant datasets that included 49,621 participants in all 13 such trials (ten trials of folic acid for prevention of cardiovascular disease [n=46,969] and three trials in patients with colorectal adenoma [n=2652]). All these trials were evenly randomised. The main outcome was incident cancer (ignoring non-melanoma skin cancer) during the scheduled treatment period (among participants who were still free of cancer). We compared those allocated folic acid with those allocated placebo, and used log-rank analyses to calculate the cancer incidence rate ratio (RR).  Findings:   During a weighted average scheduled treatment duration of 5·2 years, allocation to folic acid quadrupled plasma concentrations of folic acid (57·3 nmol/L for the folic acid groups vs 13·5 nmol/L for the placebo groups), but had no significant effect on overall cancer incidence (1904 cancers in the folic acid groups vs 1809 cancers in the placebo groups, RR 1·06, 95% CI 0·99–1·13, p=0·10). There was no trend towards greater effect with longer treatment. There was no significant heterogeneity between the results of the 13 individual trials (p=0·23), or between the two overall results in the cadiovascular prevention trials and the adenoma trials (p=0·13). Moreover, there was no significant effect of folic acid supplementation on the incidence of cancer of the large intestine, prostate, lung, breast, or any other specific site.

Information on clinical characteristics was limited.  Objective:   To assess the association between β-blockers and PCa-specific mortality in a cohort of 3561 prostate cancer patients with high-risk or metastatic disease, and to address potential confounding from the use of statins or acetylsalicylic acid (ASA).  Design, setting, and participants:   Clinical information from all men reported to the Cancer Registry of Norway with a PCa diagnosis between 2004 and 2009 (n=24 571) was coupled with information on filled prescriptions between 2004 and 2011 from the Norwegian Prescription Database. Exclusion criteria were low- or intermediate-risk disease; planned radiotherapy or radical prostatectomy; initiation of β-blocker, ASA, or statin use after diagnosis where applicable; missing information on baseline Gleason score, prostate-specific antigen level, T stage or performance status; and missing follow-up.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Cox proportional hazards modelling and competing risk regression modelling were used to analyse the effects of β-blocker use on all-cause and PCa-specific mortality, respectively. Differences between β-blocker users and nonusers regarding baseline clinical characteristics were assessed by the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney U test, Pearson chi-square test, and Student t test.  Results and limitations:   Median follow-up was 39 mo. β-Blocker use was associated with reduced PCa mortality (adjusted subhazard ratio: 0.79; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.68-0.91; p value: 0.001). The observed reduction in PCa mortality was independent of the use of statins or ASA. We observed no association with all-cause mortality (adjusted hazard ratio: 0.92; 95% CI, 0.83-1.02). The main limitations of the study were the observational study design and short follow-up.

Previous work in our laboratory demonstrated that the synthetic steroid mifepristone inhibited the growth of highly metastatic cancer cells, while simultaneously causing striking changes in cellular morphology. Here we assessed whether such morphological alterations developed in response to cytostatic concentrations of mifepristone are reversible or permanent, involve rearrangement of cytoskeletal proteins, and/or affect the adhesive capacity of the cells.  Methods:   Cancer cell lines of the ovary (SKOV-3), breast (MDA-MB-231), prostate (LNCaP), and nervous system (U87MG) were exposed to cytostatic concentrations of mifepristone and studied by phase-contrast microscopy. The transient or permanent nature of the cytostasis and morphological changes caused by mifepristone was assessed, as well as the rearrangement of cytoskeletal proteins. De-adhesion and adhesion assays were utilized to determine if mifepristone-arrested and morphologically dysregulated cells had abnormal de-adhesion/adhesion dynamics when compared to vehicle-treated controls.  Results:   Mifepristone-treated cells displayed a long, thin, spindle-like shape with boundaries resembling those of loosely adhered cells. Growth arrest and morphology changes caused by mifepristone were reversible in SKOV-3, MDA-MB-231 and U87MG, but not in LNCaP cells that instead became senescent. All cancer cell types exposed to mifepristone displayed greatly increased actin ruffling in association with accelerated de-adhesion from the culture plate, and delayed adhesion capacity to various extracellular matrix components.  Conclusions:   Cytostatic concentrations of mifepristone induced alterations in the cellular structure of a panel of aggressive, highly metastatic cancer cells of different tissues of origin. Such changes were associated with re-distribution of actin fibers that mainly form non-adhesive membrane ruffles, leading to dysregulated cellular adhesion capacity.""","""['BreeAnn N Brandhagen', 'Chelsea R Tieszen', 'Tara M Ulmer', 'Maria S Tracy', 'Alicia A Goyeneche', 'Carlos M Telleria']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Advanced assessment of migration and invasion of cancer cells in response to mifepristone therapy using double fluorescence cytochemical labeling.', 'Resistance to cisplatin and paclitaxel does not affect the sensitivity of human ovarian cancer cells to antiprogestin-induced cytotoxicity.', 'Antiprogestin mifepristone inhibits the growth of cancer cells of reproductive and non-reproductive origin regardless of progesterone receptor expression.', 'Palladin regulation of the actin structures needed for cancer invasion.', 'The Cytoskeletal Protein Cyclase-Associated Protein 1 (CAP1) in Breast Cancer: Context-Dependent Roles in Both the Invasiveness and Proliferation of Cancer Cells and Underlying Cell Signals.', 'Cyclometalated Benzimidazole Osmium(II) Complexes with Antiproliferative Activity in Cancer Cells Disrupt Calcium Homeostasis.', 'Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4/Midline-1 Axis Promotes T Lymphocyte Motility in Atherosclerosis.', 'The metastatic capacity of high-grade serous ovarian cancer cells changes along disease progression: inhibition by mifepristone.', 'The diverse functions of FAT1 in cancer progression: good, bad, or ugly?', 'Effects of nanopatterned-surface dishes on chondrocyte growth and cell cycle progression.']"""

AND WHAT DOES THE STUDY ADD?: Extended pelvic lymphadenectomy is the present standard of care according to European Association of Urology guidelines. Extended dissection improves staging, removes more metastatic lymph nodes, and potentially has therapeutic benefits. Previous reports have examined the morbidity of extended dissection compared with a more limited dissection in the open and laparoscopic setting. While some have suggested an increased complication rate with extended node dissection, others have not. This represents the first study focused on comparing the complications associated with the extent of node dissection using the modified Clavien system and Martin criteria in the literature on robot-assisted surgery. In a single surgeon series, we found no statistically significant differences in complications. With careful anatomic dissection, robot-assisted extended lymph node dissection can be performed safely and effectively, although operating time and length of hospital of stay are slightly increased.  Objectives:   To compare the perioperative course of patients undergoing robot-assisted limited lymph node dissection (LLND) or extended lymph node dissection (ELND) for prostate cancer. To examine the differential lymph node counts and rates of detection of lymph node metastases.  Patients and methods:   Between 2008 and 2012, 406 consecutive patients with D'Amico intermediate- or high-risk prostate cancer underwent either bilateral LLND (n = 204) or ELND (n = 202) and robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy by a single surgeon. The region of dissection was the obturator fossa for LLND, while ELND included, in addition, the common iliac, external iliac and internal iliac lymph nodes. All complications within 90 days of surgery were recorded according to a modified Clavien system. Clinical variables were summarized and compared. Logistic regression was used to identify predictors of complications.  Results:   There were no differences in demographics when comparing patients who underwent ELND with those who underwent LLND. The median operating time was 3.0 h for the ELND cohort and 2.8 h in the LLND cohort (P < 0.001). Intraoperative blood loss was 200 mL in both cohorts. Hospital stay was longer for a small percentage of patients in the ELND cohort, with 75% of ELND patients and 85% of LLND patients staying 1 day (P = 0.004). No significant difference was found in the overall or major complication rates between LLND (21.6% overall; 6.9% major) and ELND (22.8% overall; 4.5% major). No difference was seen in the symptomatic lymphocele rate between LLND and ELND, 2.9 vs 2.5%, respectively. Overall, the lymph-node-positive rate was 12% compared with 4% for the ELND and LLND groups, respectively (P = 0.002). A higher Charlson comorbidity index score was associated with the development of major complications.  Conclusions:   ELND at the time of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy can be performed safely with minimal additional morbidity.

To explore the relationships between knowledge, SE, and health beliefs, and engagement in HBBs.  Patients and methods:   175 patients receiving ADT by injection completed questionnaires assessing current HBBs, OP knowledge, SE, and health beliefs (motivation, perceived susceptibility, and seriousness). Descriptive statistics and independent samples t-tests were used to assess relationships between knowledge, SE, health beliefs, and engagement in HBBs.  Results:   Only 38% of patients had undergone a dual X-ray absorptiometry scan in the past 2 years. OP knowledge was low (mean [sd, range] 9.6 [4.4, 0-19]) and perceived SE moderate (84.7 [24.5, 0-120]). Health motivation was fairly high (23.6 [3.1, 6-30]), but perceived susceptibility (16.8 [4.3]) and seriousness (16.8 [4.2]) of OP were low. Few patients met the recommendations for vitamin D intake (42%) and exercise (31%), and 15% were at risk of over-supplementation of calcium. Patients taking calcium supplements (P = 0.04), and meeting guidelines for vitamin D (P = 0.008) and for exercise (P = 0.002) had significantly greater knowledge than those who did not. Patients who were engaging in less than four of five HBBs had lower knowledge (P < 0.001) and health motivation (P = 0.01) than those who were engaging in four or all five HBBs.  Conclusions:   Most patients who are receiving ADT are not receiving appropriate screening, lack basic information about bone health, and are not engaging in the appropriate HBBs.

Objective:   To identify a population of young men (aged <55 years at diagnosis) with very-low-risk prostate cancer (stage cT1c, with prostate-specific antigen [PSA] density of <0.15 ng/mL/g, Gleason score ≤6, and ≤2 positive biopsy cores with <50% tumour involvement) that may be candidates for active surveillance (AS).

Statistical analyses were undertaken using Fisher's exact and chi-square testing.  Results:   From 1987-1991 and 2007-2010, PSA screen-detected tumours diagnosed in men aged ≤55 years rose >30-fold. Data for a subset of men (174) with PSA screen-detected cancer were evaluable for disease risk assessment. Of the 174 men with screen-detected disease, 81 (47%) had very-low-risk disease. Of that group, 96% (78/81) selected treatment and, of 57 men undergoing radical prostatectomy (RP), the tumours of 49 (86%) carried favourable pathology (organ confined, <10% gland involvement, Gleason ≤6).

For this purpose, BLM and BLMGLU enyzmatically synthesized were labeled with (131)I, quality control studies were done and the incorporation yields of (131)I-BLM and (131)I-BLMGLU on these cell lines were measured. Quality-control studies showed that the radiolabeling yields were obtained as 95% and 90% for (131)I-BLM and (131)I-BLMGLU, respectively. Also, as a result of the cell culture studies, it was found that (131)I-BLM and (131)I-BLMGLU had higher incorporation on PC-3 cells than that of other cell lines. In addition to this, it was reported that the incorporation yield of (131)I-BLMGLU was higher than that (131)I-BLM. At the end of the study, cytotoxicities of BLM and BLMGLU on PC-3 cancerous cell line were inspected and fluorescent images of BLM and BLMGLU were taken on PC-3 cells by using fluorescein isothiocyanate. In conclusion, cell culture studies demonstrated that the incorporation values of (131)I-BLMGLU on the four cell lines were about five to six times higher than (131)I-BLM.

Patients and methods:   In total, 6156 men (from 1 April 2000 to 30 April 2007) with GS6 on biopsy underwent radical prostatectomy (RP) at our institution. The number of positive cores was correlated with the outcome at RP.  Results:   More positive cores correlated with less organ-confined disease (P < 0.001), positive margins (P < 0.012), increasing RP grade (P < 0.001) and increased seminal vesicles/lymph node involvement (P = 0.012). For men with data available, the actuarial risk of being biochemically free of disease at 5 years was 93.2% when ≤6 cores were positive (812 men followed to 5 years) vs 89.1% if >6 cores were positive (41 men followed to 2 years) (P = 0.6). Although the predicted 'cure rate' of >75% probability of a tumour showing no evidence of biochemical recurrence at 10 years after RP was statistically different between cases with ≤6 vs >6 positive cores (P < 0.0001), the outcome in both groups was still favourable (90.5% vs 84%). Partin-like tables were generated factoring in the number of positive cores to predict organ-confined disease as a guide for urologists to perform nerve-sparing surgery. For example, with T1c disease, there was a ≥75% probability of organ-confined disease with one to three positive cores regardless of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, and the same probability was present with four to six positive cores and a PSA level of 0-4 ng/mL.  Conclusion:   A low Gleason score on biopsy is a powerful prognostic finding, such that this favourable outcome is maintained even in the setting of multiple positive cores with GS6.""","""['Carla L Ellis', 'Patrick C Walsh', 'Alan W Partin', 'Jonathan I Epstein']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Comparison of percentage of total prostate needle biopsy tissue with cancer to percentage of cores with cancer for predicting PSA recurrence after radical prostatectomy: results from the SEARCH database.', 'Radical prostatectomy represents an effective treatment in patients with specimen-confined high pathological Gleason score prostate cancer.', 'Percent of prostate needle biopsy cores with cancer is significant independent predictor of prostate specific antigen recurrence following radical prostatectomy: results from SEARCH database.', 'The percentage of prostate needle biopsy cores with carcinoma from the more involved side of the biopsy as a predictor of prostate specific antigen recurrence after radical prostatectomy: results from the Shared Equal Access Regional Cancer Hospital (SEARCH) database.', 'Using the percentage of biopsy cores positive for cancer, pretreatment PSA, and highest biopsy Gleason sum to predict pathologic stage after radical prostatectomy: the Center for Prostate Disease Research nomograms.', 'Prostate-specific antigen 10-20 ng/mL: A predictor of degree of upgrading to ≥8 among patients with biopsy Gleason score 6.', 'PI-RADS version 2 for prediction of pathological downgrading after radical prostatectomy: a preliminary study in patients with biopsy-proven Gleason Score 7 (3+4) prostate cancer.', 'PTEN loss is associated with upgrading of prostate cancer from biopsy to radical prostatectomy.', 'Clinical role of pathological downgrading after radical prostatectomy in patients with biopsy confirmed Gleason score 3 + 4 prostate cancer.']"""

AND WHAT DOES THE STUDY ADD?: The presence of a positive pathological margin is an independent risk factor for clinically significant disease recurrence only in intermediate-risk disease when the a priori risk of micrometastatic disease is accounted for. The study examines patients with Gleason 7 prostate cancer to assess the relative importance of various margin-related variables (focality, linear length, tumour grade at margin, presence of diathermy artifact and plane of tumour) with regard to biochemical recurrence. We found that the presence or absence of a positive pathological margin outperforms any other margin-associated variable in predicting significant disease recurrence.  Objective:   To determine the influence of pathological margin variables on the risk of clinically significant biochemical recurrence in Gleason 7 prostate cancer.  Materials and methods:   Patients with Gleason 7 prostate cancer with complete clinical and pathological data and detailed follow-up were identified from a prospectively recorded prostatectomy database. Slides from all patients with positive pathological margins were reviewed by a single expert uropathologist and the following information recorded: multifocality, linear length, predominant Gleason grade at the margin, diathermy artifact and margin plane. Cox regression models were generated to determine the impact of positive pathological margins on the risk of biochemical recurrence (using various definitions thereof).  Results:   Of 1048 patients with Gleason 7 prostate cancer, 238 (23%) patients had positive margins. With a median follow-up of 11 months, biochemical recurrence occurred in 9.7% of patients with negative surgical margins and 28.4% of patients with positive margins. Positive margins were significantly associated with higher serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, tumour grade, stage and volume. In patients with positive pathological margins, controlling for other factors, no margin-derived variable (focality, linear length, tumour grade at margin, diathermy artifact or plane of tumour) was a consistent predictor of biochemical recurrence, although the presence of Gleason score 4 or tertiary Gleason score 5 tumour at the margin edge was an independent predictor of recurrence with PSA doubling times ≤ 6 and ≤9 months. Similarly, in the cohort as a whole, the pathological margin status was a more important predictor of recurrence than any other margin-derived variable.  Conclusions:   In Gleason 7 prostate cancer, positive pathological margin status was the only consistent margin-derived variable determining biochemical failure. The presence of high-grade disease at the margin may also have an impact on the development of clinically significant biochemical recurrence.""","""['James G Huang', 'John Pedersen', 'Matthew K H Hong', 'Laurence M Harewood', 'Justin Peters', 'Anthony J Costello', 'Chris M Hovens', 'Niall M Corcoran']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Impact of positive surgical margins on prostate-specific antigen failure after radical prostatectomy in adjuvant treatment-naïve patients.', 'Length of positive surgical margin after radical prostatectomy as a predictor of biochemical recurrence.', 'Positive surgical margins are a risk factor for significant biochemical recurrence only in intermediate-risk disease.', 'The importance of surgical margins in prostate cancer.', 'Contemporary grading for prostate cancer: implications for patient care.', 'Length of positive surgical margins after radical prostatectomy: Does size matter? - A systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Clinical utility of subclassifying positive surgical margins at radical prostatectomy.', 'Development and validation of a preoperative nomogram for predicting positive surgical margins after laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.', 'Risk of biochemical recurrence based on extent and location of positive surgical margins after robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.', 'Do tumor volume, percent tumor volume predict biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy?

Although researchers have considered how prostate cancer can challenge 'embodied masculinities' few studies have considered gendered dynamics in men's cancer experiences more broadly. This article helps attends to this gap by examining how men with a variety of cancers made sense of the challenges of their illness. The results, part of a grounded theory study including 30 Canadian adult men, highlight how the men perceived a troubled future and a discordant present, a profound sense of uncertainty, and feelings of isolation. These patterns, infused with societal expectations for male bodies and lives, move beyond the particular needs varying by medical, demographic and situational diversities. More specifically, they are recognised as consistent with a 'biographical disruption' or an ongoing problematic situation destabilising how the men made sense of their individual selves and the world around them. Focused on commonalities and considerate of diversities, findings are reviewed in relation to existing work on illness and gender identity and work specific to men with cancer. Implications are discussed.""","""['L M Wenger']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Eur J Cancer Care (Engl)""","""['Men managing cancer: a gender analysis.', 'Moving beyond the prostate: benefits in broadening the scope of research on men and cancer.', 'Male sexuality in theory and practice.', ""Beyond ballistics: expanding our conceptualization of men's health-related help seeking."", 'Young men with cancer: a literature review.', 'Information provision to caregivers of children with rare dermatological disorders: an international multimethod qualitative study.', 'Cross-sectional study of sex differences in psychosocial quality of life of long-term melanoma survivors.', 'Effects of exercise interventions on social and cognitive functioning of men with prostate cancer: a meta-analysis.', 'Meeting the Self at the Crossroads: Thoughts on Aging as a Young Cancer Survivor.', 'Dismantling the present and future threats of testicular cancer: a grounded theory of positive and negative adjustment trajectories.']"""

Extracts were prepared using a range of polar and non-polar solvents to leach out maximum active components. Phytochemical analysis of the extracts revealed the presence of anthraquinones, cardiac glycosides, flavonoids, saponins and tannins. Cytotoxic activity of different extracts was tested in vitro against seven human cancer cell lines from seven different tissues, such as SW-620 (colon), HOP-62 (lung), PC-3 (prostate), OVCAR-5 (ovary), HeLa (cervix), IMR-32 (neuroblastoma) and HEP-2 (liver). The ethyl acetate, chloroform and 50% methanolic extract displayed highest anti-proliferative effect in a dose-dependent manner. In vivo anti-tumor activity was evaluated against murine tumor (solid) model of Ehrlich ascites carcinoma and Sarcoma 180. The results showed that ethyl acetate and aqueous extracts suppressed the growth of Ehrlich ascites carcinoma (29.79% and 18.48%, respectively), but showed little growth inhibition in case of Sarcoma 180 (13. 86% and 8.57%, respectively). The activity might be due to the flavonoids, tannins and saponins that are present in all the extracts of the plant. Further investigation is required for the isolation of active principle(s) from the ethyl acetate extract, which has shown significant in vitro and in vivo anticancer potential.""","""['Madhulika Bhagat', 'Vikas Sharma', 'Ajit Kumar Saxena']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Indian J Biochem Biophys""","""['In vitro cytotoxic activity of leaves extracts of Holarrhena antidysenterica against some human cancer cell lines.', 'Antibacterial and preliminary phytochemical and physico-chemical analysis of Eucalyptus citriodora Hk leaf.', 'Analysis of phytochemical constituents of Eucalyptus citriodora L. responsible for antifungal activity against post-harvest fungi.', 'Botanical, Phytochemical, and Anticancer Properties of the Eucalyptus Species.', 'Anti-proliferative activity of hop-derived prenylflavonoids against human cancer cell lines.', 'In Vitro Antiproliferative Effects and Phytochemical Characterization of Carissa edulis ((Forssk) Vahl) and Pappea capensis (Eckyl and Zeyh) Extracts.', 'Green synthesis of zinc oxide nanoparticles using Eucalyptus lanceolata leaf litter: characterization, antimicrobial and agricultural efficacy in maize.', 'Value-Added Compound Recovery from Invasive Forest for Biofunctional Applications: Eucalyptus Species as a Case Study.', 'Chemopreventive Action of Anthocyanin-rich Black Soybean Fraction in APC (Min/+) Intestinal Polyposis Model.', 'Do cancer cells in human and meristematic cells in plant exhibit similar responses toward plant extracts with cytotoxic activities?']"""
