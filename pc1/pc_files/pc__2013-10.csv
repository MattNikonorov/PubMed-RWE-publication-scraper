We developed models to predict the risk of bladder cancer based on clinical and sociodemographic data on participants in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer (PLCO) screening trial.  Methods:   Baseline clinical and sociodemographic data were obtained from 149,542 PLCO participants, ages 55 to 74 years, without a prior history of bladder cancer. Cox proportional hazards models were used to predict the risk of all bladder cancers (ABC) and of high-grade bladder cancers (HGBC) from baseline information. We used the HGBC risk model to design a hypothetical bladder cancer mortality prevention trial.  Results:   Over a median follow-up of 12 years, 1,124 men and 259 women developed bladder cancer (including 392 and 72 with HGBC, respectively). The incidence in men and in women was 133.6 and 29.6 cases per 100,000 person-years, respectively. Nomograms constructed for predicting the risk of ABC and HGBC had c-indices of 0.746 and 0.759, respectively. Age, race, education, smoking (intensity and duration), comorbidity, prostatitis, syphilis, and hormone replacement therapy use were statistically significant predictors in the models. We show that our risk model can be used to design a bladder cancer mortality prevention trial half the size of a trial designed without risk stratification.  Conclusion:   Models to predict the risk of ABC and HGBC have been developed and validated.  Impact:   Using the upper 40th percentile from the HGBC model, a suitable cohort for a screening or chemoprevention trial could be identified, although the size and follow-up of such a trial would be costly.""","""['Maria C Mir', 'Andrew J Stephenson', 'Robert L Grubb rd', 'Amanda Black', 'Adam S Kibel', 'Grant Izmirlian']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev""","""['Renal-cell carcinoma risk estimates based on participants in the prostate, lung, colorectal, and ovarian cancer screening trial and national lung screening trial.', 'Dietary fiber intake and the risk of bladder cancer in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) cohort.', 'Bladder cancer risk: Use of the PLCO and NLST to identify a suitable screening cohort.', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen-Based Screening for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Evidence Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.', 'PLCO: Evolution of an Epidemiologic Resource and Opportunities for Future Studies.', 'Syndemic synergy of HPV and other sexually transmitted pathogens in the development of high-grade anal squamous intraepithelial lesions.', 'Blueberries inhibit cyclooxygenase-1 and cyclooxygenase-2 activity in human epithelial ovarian cancer.', 'Principles of Cancer Screening.', 'Summary of the 8th Annual Bladder Cancer Think Tank: Collaborating to move research forward.']"""

However, the exposure window of importance is currently unknown and assessments of height during earlier growth periods are scarce. In addition, the association between birth weight and prostate cancer remains undetermined. We assessed these relationships in a cohort of the Copenhagen School Health Records Register (CSHRR).  Methods:   The CSHRR comprises 372,636 school children. For boys born between the 1930s and 1969, birth weight and annual childhood heights-measured between ages 7 and 13 years-were analyzed in relation to prostate cancer risk. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI).  Results:   There were 125,211 males for analysis, 2,987 of who were subsequently diagnosed with prostate cancer during 2.57 million person-years of follow-up. Height z-score was significantly associated with prostate cancer risk at all ages (HRs, 1.13 to 1.14). Height at age 13 years was more important than height change (P = 0.024) and height at age 7 years (P = 0.024), when estimates from mutually adjusted models were compared. Adjustment of birth weight did not alter the estimates. Birth weight was not associated with prostate cancer risk.  Conclusions:   The association between childhood height and prostate cancer risk was driven by height at age 13 years.  Impact:   Our findings implicate late childhood, adolescence, and adulthood growth periods as containing the exposure window(s) of interest that underlies the association between height and prostate cancer.

Patients and methods:   Prospectively documented 80 patients with prostate cancer (PCa) who underwent RALRP were evaluated between June 2010 and July 2012. Patients were divided into 2 groups according to whether systematically IFS was performed or not. Group 1 (n=66) consisted of patients on whom systematic IFS was performed, Group 2 (n=14) consisted of patients on whom IFS was not performed. All recorded data evaluated and statistical analyses were performed for determining indications and predictive factors for IFS during RALRP. All patients were operated by single surgeon and IFS, pathological assessments were performed by experienced uro-pathologist. Statistical significant p value was p < 0.05.  Results:   Mean follow-up was 15±6 (25-4) months. Pre-operative prostate volume in trans- rectal ultrasonography (TRUS) was statistically higher in Group 1 than Group 2 (p = 0.037). The other parameters were statistically similar in both groups. According to outcomes of our study IFS was a dependent factor for positive surgical margin. Additionally, the cut off value of prostate volume in TRUS for IFS was 55.5 cc for IFS.  Conclusions:   Preoperative measured prostate volume in TRUS may be an indicator of IFS. Therefore, more accurate information may be given to patients with prostate cancer (Pca) before RALRP by using preoperative prostate volume in TRUS.""","""['Y Akin', 'E Avci', 'H Gulmez', 'M Akand', 'M Akif Ciftcioglu', 'I Bassorgun', 'T Erdogru']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci""","""['Robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: Multiparametric MR imaging-directed intraoperative frozen-section analysis to reduce the rate of positive surgical margins.', 'Effect of prostate gland size on the learning curve for robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy: does size matter initially?', ""'Mohs surgery of the prostate': the utility of in situ frozen section analysis during robotic prostatectomy."", 'Findings of routine apical margin biopsy during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Prevention of complications of general anesthesia linked with laparoscopic access and with robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.']"""

Glycogen synthase kinase (GSK3β) inhibits Wnt signaling by inducing β-catenin degradation, and a GSK3β inhibitor, AR79, is being evaluated as an osteoanabolic agent. However, Wnt activation has the potential to promote tumor growth; therefore, the goal of this study was to determine if AR79 has an impact on the progression of prostate cancer. Prostate cancer tumors were established in subcutaneous and bone sites of mice followed by AR79 administration, and tumor growth, β-catenin activation, proliferation, and apoptosis were assessed. Additionally, prostate cancer and osteoblast cell lines were treated with AR79, and β-catenin status, proliferation (with β-catenin knockdown in some cases), and proportion of ALDH(+)CD133(+) stem-like cells were determined. AR79 promoted prostate cancer tumor growth, decreased phospho-β-catenin, increased total and nuclear β-catenin, and increased tumor-induced bone remodeling. Additionally, AR79 treatment decreased caspase-3 and increased Ki67 expression in tumors and increased bone formation in normal mouse tibiae. Similarly, AR79 inhibited β-catenin phosphorylation, increased nuclear β-catenin accumulation in prostate cancer and osteoblast cell lines, and increased proliferation of prostate cancer cells in vitro through β-catenin. Furthermore, AR79 increased the ALDH(+)CD133(+) cancer stem cell-like proportion of the prostate cancer cell lines. In conclusion, AR79, while being bone anabolic, promotes prostate cancer cell growth through Wnt pathway activation.  Implications:   These data suggest that clinical application of pharmaceuticals that promote Wnt pathway activation should be used with caution as they may enhance tumor growth.""","""['Yuan Jiang', 'Jinlu Dai', 'Honglai Zhang', 'Joe L Sottnik', 'Jill M Keller', 'Katherine J Escott', 'Hitesh J Sanganee', 'Zhi Yao', 'Laurie K McCauley', 'Evan T Keller']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Res""","""['Inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin signaling mediates ursolic acid-induced apoptosis in PC-3 prostate cancer cells.', 'Cotargeting Polo-Like Kinase 1 and the Wnt/β-Catenin Signaling Pathway in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Role of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway in epithelial-mesenchymal transition of human prostate cancer induced by hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha.', 'Exploring the Wnt Pathway as a Therapeutic Target for Prostate Cancer.', 'Protective effects of oridonin against osteoporosis by regulating immunity and activating the Wnt3a/β-catenin/VEGF pathway in ovariectomized mice.', 'State-of-the-art therapeutic strategies for targeting cancer stem cells in prostate cancer.', 'Targeting aldehyde dehydrogenase for prostate cancer therapies.', 'Selective inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3α corrects pathophysiology in a mouse model of fragile X syndrome.', 'SOX4: The unappreciated oncogene.', 'Bone microenvironment signaling of cancer stem cells as a therapeutic target in metastatic prostate cancer.']"""

The ability to deliver such treatments with hypofractionated SBRT was attempted using RapidArc (Varian Medical systems, Palo Alto, CA) and Multiplan (Accuray inc, Sunnyvale, CA).  Materials and methods:   15 patients with dominant prostate nodules had RapidArc and Multiplan plans created using a 5 mm isotropic margin, except 3 mm posteriorly, aiming to deliver 47.5 Gy in 5 fractions to the boost whilst treating the whole prostate to 36.25 Gy in 5 fractions. An additional RapidArc plan was created using an 8 mm isotropic margin, except 5 mm posteriorly, to account for lack of intrafraction tracking.  Results:   Both RapidArc and Multiplan can produce clinically acceptable boost plans to a dose of 47.5 Gy in 5 fractions. The mean rectal doses were lower for RapidArc plans (D50 13.2 Gy vs 15.5 Gy) but the number of missed constraints was the same for both planning methods (11/75). When the margin was increased to 8 mm/5 mm for the RapidArc plans to account for intrafraction motion, 37/75 constraints were missed.  Conclusions:   RapidArc and Multiplan can produce clinically acceptable simultaneous integrated boost plans, but the mean rectal D50 and D20 with RapidArc are lower. If the margins are increased to account for intrafraction motion, the RapidArc plans exceed at least one dose constraint in 13/15 cases.

In this study, we describe the identification, in vitro characterization, structure-activity analysis, and biological evaluation of a novel PKD inhibitory scaffold exemplified by 1-naphthyl PP1 (1-NA-PP1). 1-NA-PP1 and IKK-16 were identified as pan-PKD inhibitors in a small-scale targeted kinase inhibitor library assay. Both screening hits inhibited PKD isoforms at about 100 nM and were ATP-competitive inhibitors. Analysis of several related kinases indicated that 1-NA-PP1 was highly selective for PKD as compared to IKK-16. SAR analysis showed that 1-NA-PP1 was considerably more potent and showed distinct substituent effects at the pyrazolopyrimidine core. 1-NA-PP1 was cell-active, and potently blocked prostate cancer cell proliferation by inducing G2/M arrest. It also potently blocked the migration and invasion of prostate cancer cells, demonstrating promising anticancer activities on multiple fronts. Overexpression of PKD1 or PKD3 almost completely reversed the growth arrest and the inhibition of tumor cell invasion caused by 1-NA-PP1, indicating that its anti-proliferative and anti-invasive activities were mediated through the inhibition of PKD. Interestingly, a 12-fold increase in sensitivity to 1-NA-PP1 could be achieved by engineering a gatekeeper mutation in the active site of PKD1, suggesting that 1-NA-PP1 could be paired with the analog-sensitive PKD1(M659G) for dissecting PKD-specific functions and signaling pathways in various biological systems.""","""['Manuj Tandon', 'James Johnson', 'Zhihong Li', 'Shuping Xu', 'Peter Wipf', 'Qiming Jane Wang']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['SD-208, a novel protein kinase D inhibitor, blocks prostate cancer cell proliferation and tumor growth in vivo by inducing G2/M cell cycle arrest.', 'Design, synthesis and biological evaluation of pyrazolo3,4-dpyrimidine-based protein kinase D inhibitors.', 'A novel small-molecule inhibitor of protein kinase D blocks pancreatic cancer growth in vitro and in vivo.', 'Developments in the Discovery and Design of Protein Kinase D Inhibitors.', 'Functional and therapeutic significance of protein kinase D enzymes in invasive breast cancer.', 'ATP Consumption Is Coupled with Endocytosis in Exudated Neutrophils.', 'Design, Synthesis and Biological Evaluation of Novel Pleuromutilin Derivatives Containing 6-Chloro-1-R-1H-pyrazolo3,4-dpyrimidine-4-amino Side Chain.', 'Protein Kinase D2 and D3 Promote Prostate Cancer Cell Bone Metastasis by Positively Regulating Runx2 in a MEK/ERK1/2-Dependent Manner.', 'Small Molecule Inhibitors of Protein Kinase D: Early Development, Current Approaches, and Future Directions.', 'Proteomic and Phosphoproteomic Profiling Reveals the Oncogenic Role of Protein Kinase D Family Kinases in Cholangiocarcinoma.']"""

Previously, we showed that combining Apo2L/TRAIL with sorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor, results in dramatic efficacy in Apo2L/TRAIL-resistant tumor xenografts via inhibition of Mcl-1. Soluble Apo2L/TRAIL is capable of binding to several surface receptors, including the pro-apoptotic death receptors, DR4 and DR5, and decoy receptors, DcR1 and DcR2. Monoclonal antibodies targeting either of these death receptors are being investigated as antitumor agents in clinical trials. We hypothesized that sorafenib and Apo2L/TRAIL or Apo2L/TRAIL death receptor agonist (TRA) antibodies against DR4 (mapatumumab) and DR5 (lexatumumab) will overcome resistance to Apo2L/TRAIL-mediated apoptosis and as increase antitumor efficacy in Apo2L/TRAIL-sensitive solid tumors.  Methodology/principal findings:   We found that Apo2L/TRAIL or TRA antibodies combined with sorafenib synergistically reduce cell growth and increase cell death across a panel of solid tumor cell lines in vitro. This panel included human breast, prostate, colon, liver and thyroid cancers. The cooperativity of these combinations was also observed in vivo, as measured by tumor volume and TUNEL staining as a measure of apoptosis. We found that sorafenib inhibits Jak/Stat3 signaling and downregulates their target genes, including cyclin D1, cyclin D2 and Mcl-1, in a dose-dependent manner.  Conclusions/significance:   The combination of sorafenib with Apo2L/TRAIL or Apo2L/TRAIL receptor agonist antibodies sensitizes Apo2L/TRAIL-resistant cells and increases the sensitivity of Apo2L/TRAIL-sensitive cells.

Aberrant HH signaling is involved in multiple human cancers. HH signaling involves a multi-protein cascade activating the GLI proteins that transcriptionally regulate HH target genes. We have previously reported that HH signaling is essential for human colon cancer cell survival and inhibition of this signal induces DNA damage and extensive cell death. Here we report that the HH/GLI axis regulates human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT), which determines the replication potential of cancer cells. Suppression of GLI1/GLI2 functions by a C-terminus truncated GLI3 repressor mutant (GLI3R), or by GANT61, a pharmacological inhibitor of GLI1/GLI2, reduced hTERT protein expression in human colon cancer, prostate cancer and Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cell lines. Expression of an N-terminus deleted constitutively active mutant of GLI2 (GLI2ΔN) increased hTERT mRNA and protein expression and hTERT promoter driven luciferase activity in human colon cancer cells while GANT61 inhibited hTERT mRNA expression and hTERT promoter driven luciferase activity. Chromatin immunoprecipitation with GLI1 or GLI2 antibodies precipitated fragments of the hTERT promoter in human colon cancer cells, which was reduced upon exposure to GANT61. In contrast, expression of GLI1 or GLI2ΔN in non-malignant 293T cells failed to alter the levels of hTERT mRNA and protein, or hTERT promoter driven luciferase activity. Further, expression of GLI2ΔN increased the telomerase enzyme activity, which was reduced by GANT61 administration in human colon cancer, prostate cancer, and GBM cells. These results identify hTERT as a direct target of the HH signaling pathway, and reveal a previously unknown role of the HH/GLI axis in regulating the replication potential of cancer cells.

Recent studies have indicated that sodium butyrate could inhibit the progression of prostate cancer; however, the exact mechanism is still unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanism of sodium butyrate action in prostate cancer DU145 cells.  Methods:   The inhibitory effects of NaB on cell growth were detected by the 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrrazolium bromide assay. Cell apoptosis was determined by flow cytometric analysis of DU145 cells stained with annexin V and PI. Hoechst 33258 and fluorescence microscopes were used to observe the nuclear morphology of DU145 cells after treatment with NaB. ANXA1 knockdown cells were established through transfection with ANXA1 siRNA. ANXA1 mRNA levels were measured by qRT-PCR. Bcl-2, Bax, ANXA1, ERK1/2 and pERK1/2 were detected by western blot.  Results:   NaB significantly inhibited the growth and induction apoptosis of DU145 and PC3 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Expression of the anti-apoptosis gene Bcl-xl and Bcl-2 in DU145 cells are decreased and expression of the pro-apoptosis gene Bax and Bak increased after NaB treatment. Further studies have demonstrated that NaB up-regulated the expression of ANXA1 and that the tumor inhibition action of NaB was reduced markedly through knockdown of the ANXA1 gene in DU145 cells. Moreover, the siANXA1 cells showed that cell proliferation increased and cell apoptosis was induced by the inactivation of extracellular regulated kinase (ERK).

Glutathione-S-transferases polymorphisms as well as hypermethylation of GSTP1 and functional genes in carcinogenesis, including tumor suppression gene (APC), hormone receptor that regulates cell growth and differentiation gene (RARbeta) were reported to be associated with BCR. Nevertheless, the reported results are inconsistent. To evaluate the relationship between glutathione-S-transferases polymorphisms and hypermethylation of these genes and the risk of prostate cancer BCR, we carried out a meta-analysis of the published studies.  Methods and materials:   We performed a search in Medline, Embase and CNKI database with GST, APC, RARbeta in combination with single nucleotide polymorphism, hypermethylation, prostate cancer and recurrence. Languages were restricted to English and Chinese.  Results:   Our study included 4 case-control studies and 7 cohort studies including 12 data sets and 3,037 prostate cancer patients. We confirmed that APC hypermethylation is associated with a modest hazard for biochemical recurrence after RP (HR = 1.85, 95%CI = 1.12-3.06). We also suggest GSTP1 polymorphism and CpG hypermethylation tested in serum are associated with BCR (HR = 1.94, 95%CI = 1.13-3.34). We also identified a possible association between GSTM1 null polymorphism and prostate cancer biochemical recurrence risk with borderline significance (HR = 1.29, 95%CI = 0.97-1.71).  Conclusion:   To our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis evaluating the relationship of polymorphisms and hypermethylation in GSTs and biochemical recurrence. GSTM1, GSTP1 polymorphisms and hypermethylation of GSTP1, APC may be potential biomarkers for the evaluation of the probability of BCR. Further studies are warranted to validate these findings in larger cohorts with longer follow-up.""","""['Rui Chen', 'Shancheng Ren', 'Tong Meng', 'Josephine Aguilar', 'Yinghao Sun']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Promoter hypermethylation as an independent prognostic factor for relapse in patients with prostate cancer following radical prostatectomy.', 'Polymorphisms in glutathione S-transferase genes increase risk of prostate cancer biochemical recurrence differentially by ethnicity and disease severity.', 'Glutathione-S-transferase (GST) polymorphisms are associated with relapse after radical prostatectomy.', 'An updating meta-analysis of the GSTM1, GSTT1, and GSTP1 polymorphisms and prostate cancer: a HuGE review.', 'Role of polymorphisms of GSTM1, GSTT1 and GSTP1 Ile105Val in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia risk: an updated meta-analysis.', 'Polymorphisms in Genes Encoding Glutathione Transferase Pi and Glutathione Transferase Omega Influence Prostate Cancer Risk and Prognosis.', 'Association between Retinoic acid receptor-β hypermethylation and NSCLC risk: a meta-analysis and literature review.', 'Mechanisms of Androgen-Independent Prostate Cancer.', 'DNA Methylation and Urological Cancer, a Step Towards Personalized Medicine: Current and Future Prospects.', 'Omic personality: implications of stable transcript and methylation profiles for personalized medicine.']"""

The median tumor mtDNA content was reduced in AA men. mtDNA content was also reduced in normal prostate tissues of AA men compared to CA men, suggesting a possible predisposition to cancer in AA men. mtDNA content was also reduced in benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) tissue from AA men. Tumor and BPH tissues from patients ≥ 60 years of age possess reduced mtDNA content compared to patients <60 years of age. In addition, mtDNA content was higher in normal tissues from patients with malignant T3 stage disease compared to patients with T2 stage disease. mtDNA levels in matched normal prostate tissues were nearly doubled in Gleason grade of >7 compared to ≤ 7, whereas reduced mtDNA content was observed in tumors of Gleason grade >7 compared to ≤ 7. Together, our data suggest that AA men possess lower mtDNA levels in normal and tumor tissues compared to CA men, which could contribute to higher risk and more aggressive prostate cancer in AA men.""","""['Shahriar Koochekpour', 'Timothy Marlowe', 'Keshav K Singh', 'Kristopher Attwood', 'Dhyan Chandra']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Mitochondrial dysfunction and prostate cancer racial disparities among American men.', 'Pathological outcome and biochemical recurrence-free survival after radical prostatectomy in African-American, Afro-Caribbean (Jamaican) and Caucasian-American men: an international comparison.', 'Differences in the aggressiveness of prostate cancer among Korean, Caucasian, and African American men: A retrospective cohort study of radical prostatectomy.', 'Distinct Genomic Alterations in Prostate Tumors Derived from African American Men.', 'Prostate Cancer in African American Men: The Effect of Androgens and microRNAs on Epidermal Growth Factor Signaling.', 'Mitochondrial Alterations in Prostate Cancer: Roles in Pathobiology and Racial Disparities.', 'MYC-driven increases in mitochondrial DNA copy number occur early and persist throughout prostatic cancer progression.', 'Characterization of mitochondrial dysfunction due to laser damage by 2-photon FLIM microscopy.', 'Precision intervention for prostate cancer: Re-evaluating who is at risk.', 'NKX3.1 Localization to Mitochondria Suppresses Prostate Cancer Initiation.']"""

It was our aim to evaluate how mortality after hip fracture is modified by PCa and ADT.  Methods:   PCa dataBase Sweden (PCBaSe 2.0) is based on the National PCa Register and also contains age and county-matched PCa-free men. We selected all men (n = 14,205) who had been hospitalized with a hip fracture between 2006 and 2010; 2,300 men had a prior PCa diagnosis of whom 1,518 (66%) were on ADT prior to date of fracture. Risk of death was estimated with cumulative incidence and standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) to make comparisons with the entire PCa population and the general population.  Results:   Cumulative incidences indicated that there was a higher risk of death following a hip fracture for PCa men on ADT than for PCa men not on ADT or PCa-free men, particularly in the first year. The SMRs showed that PCa men on ADT with a hip fracture were 2.44 times more likely to die than the comparison cohort of all PCa men (95%CI: 2.29-2.60). This risk was especially increased during the first month (5.64 (95%CI: 4.16-7.48)). In absolute terms, hip fractures were associated with 20 additional deaths per 1,000 person-years in PCa men not on ADT, but 30 additional deaths per 1,000 person-years for PCa men on ADT, compared to all PCa men.

A collection of 120 surgical specimens from prostatectomy cases was established, among which 54 were adenocarcinomas. Hormone-free cell culture conditions were developed allowing routine propagation of cells expressing prostate basal cell markers and stem/progenitor cell markers, and which proliferated as spheres/spheroids in suspension cultures. Colonies of androgen-independent epithelial cells grew out from 30/43 (70%) of the adenocarcinoma cases studied in detail.

All 30 CR-PrCa cell cultures were also TERT-positive, but negative for TMPRSS2-ERG.

Multiple evidence suggests that a population of tumor-initiating, or cancer stem cells (CSCs) is responsible for cancer development and exceptional drug resistance, representing a highly important therapeutic target. The present study evaluated CSC-specific alterations induced by new-generation taxoid SBT-1214 and a novel polyenolic zinc-binding curcuminoid, CMC2.24, in prostate CSCs.  Principal findings:   The CD133(high)/CD44(high) phenotype was isolated from spontaneously immortalized patient-derived PPT2 cells and highly metastatic PC3MM2 cells. Weekly treatment of the NOD/SCID mice bearing PPT2- and PC3MM3-induced tumors with the SBT-1214 led to dramatic suppression of tumor growth. Four of six PPT2 and 3 of 6 PC3MM2 tumors have shown the absence of viable cells in residual tumors. In vitro, SBT-1214 (100 nM-1 µM; for 72 hr) induced about 60% cell death in CD133(high)/CD44(+/high) cells cultured on collagen I in stem cell medium (in contrast, the same doses of paclitaxel increased proliferation of these cells). The cytotoxic effects were increased when SBT-1214 was combined with the CMC2.24. A stem cell-specific PCR array assay revealed that this drug combination mediated massive inhibition of multiple constitutively up-regulated stem cell-related genes, including key pluripotency transcription factors. Importantly, this drug combination induced expression of p21 and p53, which were absent in CD133(high)/CD44(high) cells. Viable cells that survived this treatment regimen were no longer able to induce secondary spheroids, exhibited significant morphological abnormalities and died in 2-5 days.  Conclusions:   We report here that the SBT-1214 alone, or in combination with CMC2.24, possesses significant activity against prostate CD133(high)/CD44(+/high) tumor-initiating cells. This drug combination efficiently inhibits expression of the majority of stem cell-related genes and pluripotency transcription factors.

Results:   All PET-positive lesions that were visible on PET/CT were also detectable on PET/MRI. The quality of the PET images was comparable in both groups.

The apoptosis and Akt dephosphorylation caused by NSC126188 was not substantially relieved by overexpressing wild-type Akt but was relieved by overexpressing constitutively active Akt (CA-Akt) or myristoylated Akt (myr-Akt). Furthermore, overexpression of CA-Akt or myr-Akt downregulated RhoB expression, indicating that RhoB expression is regulated by Akt signaling. Interestingly, membrane translocation of GFP-Akt by insulin exposure was abolished in the cells pretreated with NSC126188 suggesting that NSC126188 directly interfered with translocation of Akt to the plasma membrane. In addition, NSC126188 activated FoxO3a by dephosphorylating S253 via Akt inhibition. Activated FoxO3a translocated to the nucleus and increased transcription of RhoB and other target genes. PC-3 cells transiently overexpressing FoxO3a exhibited increased RhoB expression and apoptosis in response to NSC126188.

All medically certified sickness absences for depression recorded between January 1, 1990, and December 31, 1993, were compiled. Depressive symptoms were self-reported in 1993, 1996, and 1999 with the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. During a mean follow-up period of 15.2 years, 1,119 participants received a cancer diagnosis, excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer and in situ neoplasms. Considering 6 cancer sites (prostate, breast, colorectal, smoking-related, lymphoid and hematopoietic tissues, other sites) and 4 measures of depression, we found 1 positive association and 1 negative association. Overall, there was no compelling evidence for an association between depression and cancer incidence.

The aim of the present study was to delineate possible apoptotic pathway(s) involved in the EA-mediated chemotherapeutic effects in the LNCaP human prostatic cancer cell line. EA produced anti-proliferative effects through inhibition of rapamycin (mTOR) activation and a reduction in intracellular levels of β-catenin. Moreover, we demonstrated that EA induced apoptosis via downregulation of the anti-apoptotic proteins, silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1), human antigen R (HuR) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). EA modulated the expression of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) resulting in a significant increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and the activation of caspase-3. Finally, we demonstrated that EA reduced both transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels.

Patient exposure to toxic environmental chemicals and other stressors is ubiquitous, and preconception and prenatal exposure to toxic environmental agents can have a profound and lasting effect on reproductive health across the life course. Prenatal exposure to certain chemicals has been documented to increase the risk of cancer in childhood; adult male exposure to pesticides is linked to altered semen quality, sterility, and prostate cancer; and postnatal exposure to some pesticides can interfere with all developmental stages of reproductive function in adult females, including puberty, menstruation and ovulation, fertility and fecundity, and menopause. Many environmental factors harmful to reproductive health disproportionately affect vulnerable and underserved populations, which leaves some populations, including underserved women, more vulnerable to adverse reproductive health effects than other populations. The evidence that links exposure to toxic environmental agents and adverse reproductive and developmental health outcomes is sufficiently robust, and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Society for Reproductive Medicine join leading scientists and other clinical practitioners in calling for timely action to identify and reduce exposure to toxic environmental agents while addressing the consequences of such exposure.""","""['None']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Obstet Gynecol""","""['Exposure to toxic environmental agents.', 'International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics opinion on reproductive health impacts of exposure to toxic environmental chemicals.', 'Toxic environmental chemicals: the role of reproductive health professionals in preventing harmful exposures.', 'Science linking environmental contaminant exposures with fertility and reproductive health impacts in the adult female.', 'Promoting Risk Identification and Reduction of Cardiovascular Disease in Women Through Collaboration With Obstetricians and Gynecologists: A Presidential Advisory From the American Heart Association and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.', 'A science-based agenda for health-protective chemical assessments and decisions: overview and consensus statement.', 'Evaluating adherence to American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists guidelines at the first obstetric visit.', 'Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) Implementation: How the Amended Law Has Failed to Protect Vulnerable Populations from Toxic Chemicals in the United States.', 'Personal Care and Household Cleaning Product Use among Pregnant Women and New Mothers during the COVID-19 Pandemic.', 'Reproductive Health Risks Associated with Occupational and Environmental Exposure to Pesticides.']"""

The same limit of detection was obtained with both methods, and two cycles earlier detection with the LCC method was observed. KLK3 messenger RNA (mRNA) was detected in all tissue samples and in 1 of 20 blood samples identically with both methods. The background was 30 times lower, and the signal-to-background (S/B) ratio was 3 times higher, when compared with the reference method.

We assessed the association of ERG expression with AR, PTEN, SPINK1, Ki-67, and EZH2 expression levels, deletion, and mutations of chromosomal region 3p14 and TP53, and clinicopathologic variables.  Methods:   The material consisted of 326 prostatectomies, 166 needle biopsies from men treated primarily with endocrine therapy, 177 transurethral resections of castration-resistant prostate cancers (CRPC), and 114 CRPC metastases obtained from 32 men. Immunohistochemistry, FISH, and sequencing was used for the measurements.  Results:   ERG expression was found in about 45% of all patient cohorts. In a multivariate analysis, ERG expression showed independent value of favorable prognosis (P = 0.019). ERG positivity was significantly associated with loss of PTEN expression in prostatectomy (P = 0.0348), and locally recurrent CRPCs (P = 0.0042). Loss of PTEN expression was associated (P = 0.0085) with shorter progression-free survival in ERG-positive, but not in negative cases. When metastases in each subject were compared, consistent ERG, PTEN, and AR expression as well as TP53 mutations were found in a majority of subjects.  Conclusions:   A similar frequency of ERG positivity from early to late stage of the disease suggests lack of selection of ERG expression during disease progression. The prognostic significance of PTEN loss solely in ERG-positive cases indicates interaction of these pathways.

Each cohort consisted of at least 10 donors. Peripheral blood lymphocytes were irradiated ex vivo with 0.5, 1 und 2 Gy ((137)Cs γ rays). We investigated the radiosensitivity of the chromosomes 2, 11 and 17 by scoring of 100 FISH painted metaphases for each dose point and donor group. Statistical analyses were performed by nonparametric tests as Mann-Whitney test and Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA, paired Wilcoxon rank test, χ(2) goodness-of-fit test and Spearman rank-order correlation at a significance level of P < 0.05. Analysis of the overall aberration yield revealed no significant differences between any donor groups. The translocation frequencies of the chromosomes 2, 11 and 17 coincided with their relative size. Thus, none of the chromosomes analyzed were more or less radiosensitive with respect to the genomic translocation frequency. Additionally, neither of the chromosomes showed enhanced or diminished radiosensitivity in one of the donor groups.

By contrast, this study explores the complementary and perhaps more influential role of health information acquired through exposure to routinely used sources, called scanning. The authors hypothesized that scanning from nonmedical sources, both mediated and interpersonal, affects cancer screening and prevention decisions. The authors used a nationally representative longitudinal survey of 2,489 adults 40 to 70 years of age to analyze the effects of scanning on 3 cancer screening behaviors (mammography, prostate-specific antigen [PSA], and colonoscopy) and 3 prevention behaviors (exercising, eating fruits and vegetables, and dieting to lose weight). After adjustment for baseline behaviors and covariates, scanning at baseline predicted weekly exercise days 1 year later as well as daily fruit and vegetable servings 1 year later for those whose consumption of fruits and vegetables was already higher at baseline. Also, among those reporting timely screening mammogram behavior at baseline, scanning predicted repeat mammography. Scanning was marginally predictive of PSA uptake among those not reporting a PSA at baseline. Although there were strong cross-sectional associations, scanning did not predict dieting or colonoscopy uptake in longitudinal analyses.

However, limited effort has been made to correlate these effects to the active ingredients of saffron. The present study was designed to elucidate cytotoxic and apoptosis induction by safranal, the major coloring compound in saffron, in a human prostate cancer cell line (PC-3).  Materials and methods:   PC-3 and human fetal lung fibroblast (MRC-5) cells were cultured and exposed to safranal (5, 10, 15, and 20 μg/ml). The 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay was performed to assess cytotoxicity. DNA fragmentation was assessed by gel electrophoresis. Cells were incubated with different concentrations of safranal, and cell morphologic changes and apoptosis were determined by the normal inverted microscope, Annexin V, and propidium iodide, followed by flow cytometric analysis, respectively.  Results:   MTT assay revealed a remarkable and concentration-dependent cytotoxic effect of safranal on PC-3 cells in comparison with non-malignant cell line. The morphologic alterations of the cells confirmed the MTT results. The IC50 values against PC-3 cells were found to be 13.0 ΁ 0.07 and 6.4 ΁ 0.09 μg/ml at 48 and 72 h, respectively. Safranal induced an early and late apoptosis in the flow cytometry histogram of treated cells, indicating apoptosis is involved in this toxicity. DNA analysis revealed typical ladders as early as 48 and 72 h after treatment, indicative of apoptosis.  Conclusions:   Our preclinical study demonstrated a prostate cancer cell line to be highly sensitive to safranal-mediated growth inhibition and apoptotic cell death.

While HERVs may play a role in autoimmune and neoplastic disease, no mechanistic association has yet been established. We studied the expression and immunogenicity of a HERV-K GAG protein encoded on chromosome 22q11.23 in relation to the clinical course of prostate cancer.  Experimental design:   In vitro expression of GAG-HERV-K was analyzed in panels of normal and malignant tissues, microarrays, and cell lines, and effects of demethylation and androgen stimulation were evaluated. Patient sera were analyzed for seroreactivity to GAG-HERV-K and other self-antigens by ELISA and seromics (protein array profiling).  Results:   GAG-HERV-K expression was most frequent in prostate tissues and regulated both by demethylation of the promoter region and by androgen stimulation. Serum screening revealed that antibodies to GAG-HERV-K are found in a subset of patients with prostate cancer (33 of 483, 6.8%) but rarely in male healthy donors (1 of 55, 1.8%). Autoantibodies to GAG-HERV-K occurred more frequently in patients with advanced prostate cancer (29 of 191 in stage III-IV, 21.0%) than in early prostate cancer (4 of 292 in stages I-II, 1.4%). Presence of GAG-HERV-K serum antibody was correlated with worse survival of patients with prostate cancer, with a trend for faster biochemical recurrence in patients with antibodies to GAG-HERV-K.  Conclusions:   Preferential expression of GAG-HERV-K ch22q11.23 in prostate cancer tissue and increased frequency of autoantibodies observed in patients with advanced prostate cancer make this protein one of the first bona fide retroviral cancer antigens in humans, with potential as a biomarker for progression and biochemical recurrence rate of prostate cancer.

Local CYP24A1 expression levels and the effect of selective modulation were analyzed using tissue microarrays from needle core biopsy specimens and xenograft-bearing mouse models. CYP24A1 mRNA was elevated in malignant human prostate tissues compared to benign lesions. High CYP24A1 protein levels were seen in poorly differentiated and highly advanced stages of prostate cancer and correlated with parallel increase in the tumor proliferation rate. The use of CYP24A1 RNAi enhanced the cytostatic effects of vitamin D3 in human prostate cancer cells. Remarkably, subcutaneous and orthotopic xenografts of prostate cancer cells harboring CYP24A1 shRNA resulted in a drastic reduction in tumor volume when mice were subjected to vitamin D3 supplementation.

Methods:   In COU-AA-301, post-docetaxel mCRPC patients were randomized 2:1 to AA 1000 mg (n=797) or placebo (n=398) once daily, each with prednisone 5 mg b.i.d. The primary end point was OS; secondary end points included radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS), PSA response rate and objective response rate (ORR). Treatment effects in visceral disease (n=352) and non-visceral disease (n=843) subsets were examined using final data (775 OS events).  Results:   AA plus prednisone produced similar absolute improvement in median OS in patients with (4.6 months) and without (4.8 months) visceral disease versus prednisone; hazard ratios (HRs) were 0.79 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.60-1.05; P=0.102) and 0.69 (95% CI: 0.58-0.83; P<0.0001), respectively.

In this report, we show for the first time that DUSP1 over-expression in DU145 cells promotes apoptosis and decreases NF-κB activity by blocking p65/NF-κB nuclear translocation. Moreover, although DUSP1 impairs TNF-α-induced p38 MAPK and JNK activation, only the specific inhibition of p38 MAPK exerts the same effects than DUSP1 over-expression on both apoptosis and NF-κB activity. Consistently, DUSP1 promotes apoptosis and decreases NF-κB activity in cells in which p38 MAPK is induced by TNF-α treatment. These results demonstrate that p38 MAPK is specifically involved in DUSP1-mediated effects on both apoptosis and NF-κB activity. Interestingly, we show an inverse correlation between DUSP1 expression and activation of both p65/NF-κB and p38 MAPK in human prostate tissue specimens. Thus, most of apparently normal glands, benign prostatic hyperplasia and low-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia samples show high DUSP1 expression and low levels of both nuclear p65/NF-κB and activated p38 MAPK. By contrast, DUSP1 expression levels are low or even absent in high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and prostatic adenocarcinoma samples, whereas nuclear p65/NF-κB and activated p38 MAPK are highly expressed in the same samples. Overall, our results provide evidence for a role of DUSP1 in the apoptosis of prostate cancer cells, through a mechanism involving the inhibition of p38 MAPK and NF-κB. Furthermore, our findings suggest that the ratio between DUSP1 and p65/NF-κB expression levels, rather than the individual expression of both molecules, is a better marker for diagnostic purposes in prostate cancer.""","""['Beatriz Gil-Araujo', 'María-Val Toledo Lobo', 'María Gutiérrez-Salmerón', 'Julia Gutiérrez-Pitalúa', 'Santiago Ropero', 'Javier C Angulo', 'Antonio Chiloeches', 'Marina Lasa']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Mol Oncol""","""['Thyroid hormone antagonizes tumor necrosis factor-alpha signaling in pituitary cells through the induction of dual specificity phosphatase 1.', 'Expression of NF-κB-related proteins and their modulation during TNF-α-provoked apoptosis in prostate cancer cells.', 'Inhibition of NF-kappaB-dependent transcription by MKP-1: transcriptional repression by glucocorticoids occurring via p38 MAPK.', 'TNF-alpha/IL-1/NF-kappaB transduction pathway in human cancer prostate.', 'Dual-specificity phosphatases: therapeutic targets in cancer therapy resistance.', 'Integrating scRNA and bulk-RNA sequencing develops a cell senescence signature for analyzing tumor heterogeneity in clear cell renal cell carcinoma.', 'Identification of Genes Involved in EGF-induced Apoptosis Using CRISPR/Cas9 Knockout Screening: Implications for Novel Therapeutic Targets in EGFR-Overexpressing Cancers.', 'DUSP1 promotes muscle atrophy by inhibiting myocyte differentiation in cachectic patients.', 'A Novel L-Phenylalanine Dipeptide Inhibits the Growth and Metastasis of Prostate Cancer Cells via Targeting DUSP1 and TNFSF9.', 'Thyroid hormones act as modulators of inflammation through their nuclear receptors.']"""

Through their spirituality they obtained greater comfort and peace of mind during what was for many of them a very traumatic time.

In this study, we asked whether human prostate cancer PC-3 cells would exploit NOS2/NO similarly and, if so, how proliferation of surviving cells might be affected. Irradiation of photosensitized PC-3 cells resulted in a rapid (<1 h), robust (~12-fold), and prolonged (∼20 h) post-irradiation upregulation of NOS2. Caspase-3/7 activation and apoptosis were stimulated by NOS2 inhibitors and a NO scavenger, implying that induced NO was acting cytoprotectively. Cyclic GMP involvement was ruled out, whereas suppression of pro-apoptotic JNK and p38 MAPK activation was clearly implicated. Cells surviving photostress grew back ~2-times faster than controls. NOS2 inhibition prevented this and the large increase in cell cycle S-phase occupancy observed after irradiation.

We have assessed the in vivo accuracy of needle tip localization by TRUS using cone-beam CT (CBCT) as our reference standard.  Methods and materials:   Needle positions from 37 implants have been analyzed. A median of 16 needles (range, 16-18) per implant were inserted, advanced to the prostate base, and their tips identified using live TRUS images and real-time planning BT software. Needle protrusion length from the template was recorded to allow for reverification before capturing images for planning. The needles remained locked in the template, which was fixed to the stepper, while a set of three-dimensional TRUS images was acquired for needle path reconstruction and HDR-BT treatment planning. Following treatment, CBCT images were acquired for subsequent needle reconstruction using a BT Treatment Planning System. The coordinates of each needle tip were recorded from the Treatment Planning System for CT and US and compared.  Results:   A total of 574 needle tip positions have been compared between TRUS and CBCT. Of these, 59% agreed within 1 mm, 27% within 1-2 mm, and 11% agreed within 2-3 mm. The discrepancy between tip positions in the two modalities was greater than 3 mm for only 20 needles (3%).

Since its introduction in clinical practice, the urinary prostate cancer gene 3 (PCA3) assay has shown promising results for prostate cancer (PC) detection. Furthermore, multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mMRI) has the ability to better describe several aspects of PC.  Methods:   A prospective study of 171 patients with negative prostate biopsy findings and a persistent high prostate-specific antigen level was conducted to assess the role of mMRI and PCA3 in identifying PC. All patients underwent the PCA3 test and mMRI before a second transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy. The accuracy and reliability of PCA3 (3 different cutoff points) and mMRI were evaluated. Four multivariate logistic regression models were analyzed, in terms of discrimination and the cost benefit, to assess the clinical role of PCA3 and mMRI in predicting the biopsy outcome. A decision curve analysis was also plotted.  Results:   Repeated transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy identified 68 new cases (41.7%) of PC. The sensitivity and specificity of the PCA3 test and mMRI was 68% and 49% and 74% and 90%, respectively. Evaluating the regression models, the best discrimination (area under the curve 0.808) was obtained using the full model (base clinical model plus mMRI and PCA3). The decision curve analysis, to evaluate the cost/benefit ratio, showed good performance in predicting PC with the model that included mMRI and PCA3.

We synthesized and evaluated the effects of caffeic acid, CAPE (2) and 18 synthetic derivatives on cell viability and androgen-dependent cell proliferation, subcellular localisation and expression of androgen receptor (AR) and secretion of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in LNCaP human hormone-dependent prostate cancer cells. Several synthetic derivatives of CAPE were strong, concentration-dependent cytotoxic agents in LNCaP cells with IC50 values in the 6.8-26.6 μM range, potencies that were up to five-fold greater than that of CAPE (33.7±4.0 μM). A number of caffeic acid derivatives were inhibitors of androgen-stimulated LNCaP cell proliferation with concomitant inhibition of DHT-stimulated PSA secretion. Compound 24 was the most cytotoxic and antiproliferative caffeic acid derivative (IC50 values of 6.8±0.3 and 2.4±0.8 μM, respectively) inhibiting DHT-stimulated cell proliferation and PSA secretion statistically significantly at concentrations as low as 0.3 μM. Exposure to DHT increased cytoplasmic and nuclear AR levels and co-treatment with increasing concentrations of compound 24 or CAPE (2), notably, further increased these levels.

We have previously demonstrated that ROS increased the expression and activity of the chemokine receptor, CXCR4, which enhanced metastatic functions in prostate cancer cells. Studies have also revealed that CXCR4 and its ligand, SDF-1α, promoted ROS accumulation; however the source of ROS was not investigated. Recent evidence suggested that ROS accumulation in prostate cancer cell lines was contributed by the NADPH oxidase (NOX) family of enzymes. Herein, we sought to determine whether the CXCR4/SDF-1α signaling axis mediates ROS production through NOX in prostate cancer. We observed an increase in intracellular ROS generation in prostate cancer cells upon SDF-1α stimulation compared to untreated samples. Conversely, lower levels of ROS were detected in cells treated with AMD3100 (CXCR4 antagonist) or the ROS scavenger, N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC). Markedly reduced levels of ROS were observed in cells treated with apocynin (NOX inhibitor) compared to rotenone (mitochondrial complex I inhibitor)-treated cells. Specifically, we determined that NOX2 responded to, and was regulated by, the SDF-1α/CXCR4 signaling axis.

Emerging associations between sexual health history and prostate cancer risk were not widely known by the sample as a whole and perceived availability of prostate health education in college was low. Finally, gender differences in family communication about cancer and racial differences in the number of family members with cancer were observed, which could have implications for perpetuating existing gender and racial gaps in health literacy and cancer awareness.

At the conclusion of the project, 20 individuals (all clinical and community partners, including the eight advisory council members) were invited to complete a survey to assess their perceived impact of the collaboration on the community and provide suggestions for future collaborations. Most partners agreed that their organization benefitted from the collaboration and that various aspects of the advisory council process (e.g., both formal and informal communication) worked well. The most noted accomplishment of the partnership related to leveraging the collaboration to make men more knowledgeable about prostate cancer decision making.

Methods:   A total of 80 patients were enrolled on the AS program in our institution between January 2008 and June 2012. All data were collected prospectively in a secure database.  Results:   The mean age of patients enrolled was 62.7 years (range 50-72). Median PSA at enrolment was 5.6 ng/mL (range 1.2-13.4). The mean follow-up was 32 months (range 2-54). In total, 85 % of patients had a repeat biopsy after 1-year with 30 % having another biopsy after 3 years. Overall, 45 % of patients remain on AS. In the remainder; 42.5 % of patients have been removed from AS for definitive treatment, while 8.75 % of patients are now on watchful waiting, 2.5 % of patients self discharged from the program and one patient died of cardiovascular disease. The prostate cancer specific survival rate is 100 %. Reasons for removal from AS and referral for treatment were; 67.6 % of patients had upgrade of disease on repeat biopsy, 17.6 % of patients had PSA progression, 11.8 % patients had progression of disease on MRI, and one patient developed a palpable nodule. Regarding definitive treatment; 52.9 % of patients have been for referred for external beam radiotherapy, 14.7 % have been referred for brachytherapy, 29.4 % have been referred for surgery and one patient has refused definitive treatment.

Conceptually, red marrow (RM) dosimetry allows myelotoxicity to be predicted, but the correlation is poor due to dosimetric uncertainty, individual sensitivity and biological effects from previous treatments. According to EANM guidelines, basic dosimetric procedures have been studied to improve the correlation between dosimetry and myelotoxicity in (153)Sm-EDTMP therapy.  Methods:   RM dosimetry for 33 treatments of bone metastases from breast, prostate and lung tumours was performed prospectively (with (99m)Tc-MDP) and retrospectively, acquiring whole-body scans early and late after injection. The (153)Sm-EDTMP activity was calculated by prospective dosimetry based on measured skeletal uptake and full physical retention, with the RM absorbed dose not exceeding 3.8 Gy. Patient-specific RM mass was evaluated by scaling in terms of body weight (BW), lean body mass (LBM) and trabecular volume (TV) estimated from CT scans of the L2–L4 vertebrae. Correlations with toxicity were determined in a selected subgroup of 27 patients, in which a better correlation between dosimetry and myelotoxicity was expected.  Results:   Skeletal uptakes of (99m)Tc and (153)Sm (Tc% and Sm%) were well correlated. The median Sm% was higher in prostate cancer (75.3 %) than in lung (60.5%, p = 0.005) or breast (60.8%, p = 0.008). PLT and WBC nadirs were not correlated with administered activity, but were weakly correlated with uncorrected RM absorbed doses, and the correlation improved after rescaling in terms of BW, LBM and TV. Most patients showed transient toxicity (grade 1–3), which completely and spontaneously recovered over a few days. Using TV, RM absorbed dose was in the range 2–5 Gy, with a median of 312 cGy for PLT in patients with toxicity and 247 cGy in those with no toxicity (p = 0.019), and 312 cGy for WBC in those with toxicity and 232 cGy in those with no toxicity (p = 0.019). ROC curves confirmed the correlations, yielding toxicity absorbed dose thresholds of 265 cGy for PLT and 232 cGy for WBC.  Conclusion:   The best predictor of myelotoxicity and blood cells nadir was obtained scaling the RM absorbed dose in terms of the estimated TV. It seems clear that the increase in skeletal uptake due to the presence of bone metastases and the assumption of full physical retention cause an overestimation of the RM absorbed dose. Nevertheless, an improvement of the dose–toxicity correlation is easily achievable by simple methods, also leading to possible improvement in multifactorial analyses of myelotoxicity.""","""['Massimiliano Pacilio', 'Guido Ventroni', 'Chiara Basile', 'Pasquale Ialongo', 'Domenico Becci', 'Lucio Mango']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging""","""['Prospective dosimetry with 99mTc-MDP in metabolic radiotherapy of bone metastases with 153Sm-EDTMP.', 'Characterization of the (153)SmSm-EDTMP pharmacokinetics and estimation of radiation absorbed dose on an individual basis.', 'Prospective 153Sm-EDTMP therapy dosimetry by whole-body scintigraphy.', '153Sm-EDTMP for bone pain palliation in skeletal metastases.', 'Samarium lexidronam (153Sm-EDTMP): skeletal radiation for osteoblastic bone metastases and osteosarcoma.', 'Personalized Dosimetry in Targeted Radiation Therapy: A Look to Methods, Tools and Critical Aspects.', 'Disturbance of cellular homeostasis as a molecular risk evaluation of human endothelial cells exposed to nanoparticles.', 'Recent Progress in the Theranostics Application of Nanomedicine in Lung Cancer.', 'Correlation of dose with toxicity and tumour response to 90Y- and 177Lu-PRRT provides the basis for optimization through individualized treatment planning.', 'Dosimetry-Based Consideration on Remission and Relapse after Therapy with 223Ra-Dichloride in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC) with Bone Metastases.

The authors found that SAFB1 physically associates with AR protein and inhibits AR transcriptional activity and androgen-sensitive gene expression. SAFB1 had no effect on chromatin occupancy of AR, but silencing of SAFB1 abolished recruitment MST1, a known AR repressor, at AR target loci. They also showed that SAFB1 interacts with EZH2, SUZ12 and EED, three core components of the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), which catalyzes the gene repression histone modification H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3). The authors further showed that forced expression of SAFB1 increases H3K27me3 at AR target loci and this effect requires EZH2. Finally, the authors demonstrated that expression of SAFB1 is downregulated in human prostate cancer (PCa) specimens and SAFB1 knockdown results in an aggressive phenotype of PCa.

Although reduced in prostate cancer above Gleason grade 3, ERβ is a potential drug target at the initial stage of the disease. In human prostate cancer cells, we found that ERβ causes apoptosis by increasing the expression of pro-apoptotic factor p53-upregulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA), independent of p53, but dependent on the forkhead transcription factor class-O family member, FOXO3a. FOXO3a has previously been shown to induce PUMA after growth factor withdrawal and inhibition of the Akt pathway. Surprisingly, the phosphorylation of FOXO3a remained unchanged, while the mRNA and total protein levels of FOXO3a were increased in response to ERβ expression or treatment of PC3, 22Rv1 and LNCaP cells with the ERβ-specific ligands 3β-Adiol (5α-androstane-3β,17β-diol), DPN (diarylpropionitrile) or 8β-VE2 (8-vinylestra-1,3,5 (10)-triene-3,17β-diol). Knockdown of FOXO3a or ERβ expression abolished the increase of PUMA in response to 3β-Adiol in LNCaP and PC3 cells, suggesting that FOXO3a mediates the apoptotic effect of 3β-Adiol-activated ERβ. Moreover, the ventral prostate of ERβ-/- mice had decreased expression of FOXO3a and PUMA compared with the ERβ+/+ mice, indicating a relationship between ERβ and FOXO3a expression. The regulation of FOXO3a by ERβ in normal basal epithelial cells indicates a function of ERβ in cell differentiation and maintenance of cells in a quiescent state. In addition, the expression of ERβ, FOXO3a and PUMA is comparable and higher in benign prostatic hyperplasia than in prostate cancer Gleason grade 4 or higher, where there is substantial loss of ERβ, FOXO3a and PUMA. We conclude that ERβ induces apoptosis of prostate cancer cells by increasing transcription of FOXO3a, leading to an increase of PUMA and subsequent triggering of apoptosis via the intrinsic pathway involving caspase-9. Furthermore, we conclude that ligands specifically activating ERβ could be useful pharmaceuticals in the treatment of prostate cancer.""","""['P Dey', 'A Ström', 'J-Å Gustafsson']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['Re: Estrogen receptor β upregulates FOXO3a and causes induction of apoptosis through PUMA in prostate cancer.', 'Re: Estrogen receptor β upregulates FOXO3a and causes induction of apoptosis through PUMA in prostate cancer.', 'Inhibition of AKT/FoxO3a signaling induced PUMA expression in response to p53-independent cytotoxic effects of H1: A derivative of tetrandrine.', 'Inhibition of AKT promotes FOXO3a-dependent apoptosis in prostate cancer.', 'FOXO3a signaling pathway in prostate cancer: Progress in studies.', 'FOXO3a and Its Regulators in Prostate Cancer.', 'Contribution of microRNA-30d to the prevention of the thyroid cancer occurrence and progression: mechanism and implications.', 'Deciphering sex-specific miRNAs as heat-recorders in zebrafish.', 'Identification of NHLRC1 as a Novel AKT Activator from a Lung Cancer Epigenome-Wide Association Study (EWAS).', 'Ginsenoside Rg1 enhances the healing of injured tendon in achilles tendinitis through the activation of IGF1R signaling mediated by oestrogen receptor.', 'Sirtuins and Hypoxia in EMT Control.']"""

Materials and methods:   In 1,201 subjects from a previously described multicenter longitudinal cohort we modeled the EPIC-CP domain scores of each treatment group before treatment, and at short-term and long-term followup. We considered a posttreatment domain score change from pretreatment of 0.5 SD or greater clinically significant and p ≤ 0.01 statistically significant. We determined the domain minimally important differences using the pooled 0.5 SD of the 2, 6, 12 and 24-month posttreatment changes from pretreatment values. We then recalibrated an EPIC-CP based nomogram model predicting 2-year post-prostatectomy functional erection from that developed using EPIC-26.  Results:   For each health related quality of life domain EPIC-CP was sensitive to similar posttreatment health related quality of life changes with time, as was observed using EPIC-26. The EPIC-CP minimally important differences in changes in the urinary incontinence, urinary irritation/obstruction, bowel, sexual and vitality/hormonal domains were 1.0, 1.3, 1.2, 1.6 and 1.0, respectively.

Here, we aimed to investigate the roles of EpCAM in CaP metastasis and chemo/radioresistance. Expression of EpCAM in CaP cell lines and human CaP tissues was assessed using immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry, respectively. EpCAM was knocked down (KD) in PC-3, DU145 and LNCaP-C4-2B cells using small interfering RNA (siRNA), and KD results were confirmed by confocal microscope, Western blotting and quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Cell growth was evaluated by proliferation and colony formation assays. The invasive potential was assessed using a matrigel chamber assay. Tumorigenesis potential was measured by a sphere formation assay. Chemo-/radiosensitivity were measured using a colony formation assay. Over-expression of EpCAM was found in primary CaP tissues and lymph node metastases including cancer cells and surrounding stromal cells.

We describe analyses of data for patient-reported pain and functional status in a preplanned interim analysis of a phase 3 trial.  Methods:   Between April 28, 2009, and June 23, 2010, patients with progressive, metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer were enrolled into a multinational, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Patients were eligible if they were asymptomatic (score of 0 or 1 on item three of the Brief Pain Inventory Short Form [BPI-SF] questionnaire) or mildly symptomatic (score of 2 or 3) and had not previously received chemotherapy. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive oral abiraterone (1 g daily) plus prednisone (5 mg twice daily) or placebo plus prednisone in continuous 4-week cycles. Pain was assessed with the BPI-SF questionnaire, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) with the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate (FACT-P) questionnaire. We analysed data with prespecified criteria for clinically meaningful pain progression and deterioration in HRQoL. All patients who underwent randomisation were included in analyses.  Findings:   1088 patients underwent randomisation: 546 were assigned to abiraterone plus prednisone and 542 to placebo plus prednisone. At the time of the second prespecified interim analysis, median follow-up was 22·2 months (IQR 20·2-24·8). Median time to progression of mean pain intensity was longer in patients assigned to abiraterone plus prednisone (26·7 months [95% CI 19·3-not estimable]) than in those assigned to placebo plus prednisone (18·4 months [14·9-not estimable]; hazard ratio [HR] 0·82, 95% CI 0·67-1·00; p=0·0490), as was median time to progression of pain interference with daily activities (10·3 months [95% CI 9·3-13·0] vs 7·4 months [6·4-8·6]; HR 0·79, 95% CI 0·67-0·93; p=0·005). Median time to progression of worst pain was also longer with abiraterone plus prednisone (26·7 months [95% CI 19·4-not estimable]) than with placebo plus prednisone (19·4 months [16·6-not estimable]), but the difference was not significant (HR 0·85, 95% CI 0·69-1·04; p=0·109). Median time to HRQoL deterioration was longer in patients assigned to abiraterone plus prednisone than in those assigned to placebo plus prednisone as assessed by the FACT-P total score (12·7 months [95% CI 11·1-14·0] vs 8·3 months [7·4-10·6]; HR 0·78, 95% CI 0·66-0·92; p=0·003) and by the score on its prostate-cancer-specific subscale (11·1 months [8·6-13·8] vs 5·8 months [5·5-8·3]; HR 0·70, 95% CI 0·60-0·83; p<0·0001).

Methods:   All ISP registered in the Norwegian Stroke Research Registry (NORSTROKE) as part of the ongoing Bergen NORSTROKE Study were included. Stroke etiology was determined by the Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment criteria, and the severity of the stroke was defined from the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score. Information about prior or ongoing cancer disease and type was retrospectively obtained from the medical patient record and The Cancer Registry of Norway. The prevalence of cancer among stroke patients was compared with the prevalence of cancer in the general population.  Results:   Among 1456 ISP, 229 (15.7%) patients had 1 or more cancer diagnoses before the stroke. The prevalence of cancer was higher among stroke patients compared with the general population (P = .001). The most common cancer types were colorectal cancer (20.2%), prostate cancer (15.6%), breast cancer (12.7 %), cancer of the urinary tract system (10.3%), gynecological cancer (6.2%), and lung cancer (4.5%). Logistic regression analysis showed that patients with prior cancer had cardioembolic strokes at a higher rate (P = .03).

Objectives:   To explore the association between classes of antihypertensive drugs and survival in cancer patients.  Methods:   Provincial Cancer Registry data was linked with a Provincial Drug Program Information Network (DPIN) for patients with lung (n=4241), colorectal (n=3967), breast (n=4019) or prostate (n=3355) cancer between the years of 2004 and 2008. Cox regression analyses were used to compare survival of patients using beta blockers (BBs), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/receptor blockers (ACEi/ARB), calcium channel blockers (CCBs) or thiazide diuretics (TDs) to survival of patients who did not use any of these antihypertensive drugs. Survival of patients using only one class of antihypertensive drugs were compared to each other, with BBs as the reference class.  Results:   Compared to the antihypertensive drug non-user cohort, BBs had no effect on survival for any of the cancers. ACEi/ARBs use was weakly associated with increased deaths for breast cancer (HR: 1.22, 95% CI: 1.04-1.44) and lung cancer (HR: 1.11, 95% CI: 1.03-1.21) patients. Deaths were also increased with CCB use in patients with breast cancer (HR: 1.22, 95% CI: 1.02-1.47) and with TD use in lung cancer patients (HR: 1.1, 95% CI: 1.01-1.19). There was strong evidence (p-value <0.0001) of an increase in deaths with TD use for colorectal (HR: 1.28, 95% CI: 1.15-1.42), and prostate (HR 1.41, 1.2-1.65) cancer patients. When including only antihypertensive drug users prescribed one drug class, lung cancer patients receiving CCBs had improved survival compared to BBs (HR 0.79, 95% CI: 0.64-0.98).  Conclusions:   Some classes of antihypertensive agents are associated with a decreased survival in certain cancers. The decrease could be due to more comorbidities in antihypertensive drug users.

We reviewed the incidence of device malfunctions among patients undergoing PBT.  Methods and materials:   From March 2009 through July 2012, 42 patients with implanted cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIED; 28 pacemakers and 14 cardioverter-defibrillators) underwent 42 courses of PBT for thoracic (23, 55%), prostate (15, 36%), liver (3, 7%), or base of skull (1, 2%) tumors at a single institution. The median prescribed dose was 74 Gy (relative biological effectiveness; range 46.8-87.5 Gy), and the median distance from the treatment field to the CIED was 10 cm (range 0.8-40 cm). Maximum proton and neutron doses were estimated for each treatment course. All CIEDs were checked before radiation delivery and monitored throughout treatment.  Results:   Median estimated peak proton and neutron doses to the CIED in all patients were 0.8 Gy (range 0.13-21 Gy) and 346 Sv (range 11-1100 mSv). Six CIED malfunctions occurred in 5 patients (2 pacemakers and 3 defibrillators). Five of these malfunctions were CIED resets, and 1 patient with a defibrillator (in a patient with a liver tumor) had an elective replacement indicator after therapy that was not influenced by radiation. The mean distance from the proton beam to the CIED among devices that reset was 7.0 cm (range 0.9-8 cm), and the mean maximum neutron dose was 655 mSv (range 330-1100 mSv). All resets occurred in patients receiving thoracic PBT and were corrected without clinical incident. The generator for the defibrillator with the elective replacement indicator message was replaced uneventfully after treatment.  Conclusions:   The incidence of CIED resets was about 20% among patients receiving PBT to the thorax. We recommend that PBT be avoided in pacing-dependent patients and that patients with any type of CIED receiving thoracic PBT be followed closely.""","""['Daniel R Gomez', 'Falk Poenisch', 'Chelsea C Pinnix', 'Tommy Sheu', 'Joe Y Chang', 'Nada Memon', 'Radhe Mohan', 'Marc A Rozner', 'Anne H Dougherty']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Malfunctions of implantable cardiac devices in patients receiving proton beam therapy: incidence and predictions.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of alpha 6 and beta 1 integrin subunits in mediating tumour-stromal interactions.  Methods:   Utilising 3D in vitro assays we evaluated and compared 1. Monocultures of prostate metastatic PC3, bone stromal derived HS5 and prostate epithelial RWPE-1 cells and 2. Tumour-stromal co-cultures (PC3 + HS5) to ascertain changes in cellular phenotype, function and expression of metastatic markers.  Results:   In comparison to 3D monocultures of PC3 or HS5 cells, when cultured together, these cells displayed up-regulated invasive and proliferative qualities, along with altered expression of epithelial-to-mesenchymal and chemokine protein constituents implicated in metastatic dissemination. When co-cultured, HS5 cells were found to re-express N-Cadherin and chemokine receptor CXCR7. Alterations in N-Cadherin expression were found to be mediated by soluble factors secreted by PC3 tumour cells, while chemokine receptor re-expression was dependent on direct cell-cell interactions. We have also shown that integrins beta 1 and alpha 6 play an integral role in maintaining cell homeostasis and mediating expression of E-Cadherin, N-Cadherin and vimentin, in addition to chemokine receptor CXCR7.  Conclusions:   Collectively our results suggest that both PC3 and HS5 cells provide a ""protective"" and reciprocal milieu that promotes tumour growth.

The US Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (US PLCO) cancer screening trial concluded that PSA-based screening conferred no meaningful survival benefit, whereas the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) and the GOTEBORG clinical trial (GOTEBORG) trials claimed statistically significant life-saving benefits. These divergent outcomes have not provided physicians with clarity on the best evidence-based treatment. To determine the extent to which these divergent outcomes are clinically meaningful, we evaluated these data and those of a long-term prospective cohort study in the context of the clinically documented harms of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). We noted the unheralded fact that in both European trials far more patients received hormonal treatment in the control than the prostatectomy arm, whereas hormonal therapy in the US trial was balanced between arms. We examined this imbalance in ADT treatment and prostate cancer-related deaths in the contexts of contamination, stage migration, and attribution of cause of death, all of which impinge on data interpretation. The ERSPC and GOTEBORG data are compatible with the hypothesis that ADT treatment contributes differentially to an increase in prostate cancer deaths in control patients. If so, the claim of a reduction in prostate cancer deaths in the screened cohort requires reappraisal. The conventional interpretation that PSA screening and radical treatment intervention are the major contributors to the results of these two studies needs more rigorous scientific scrutiny, as does the role of ADT treatment of nonmetastatic disease.""","""['Ian E Haines', 'George L Gabor Miklos']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Natl Cancer Inst""","""['Prostate cancer screening: biases and the need for consensus.', 'Re: Prostate-specific antigen screening trials and prostate cancer deaths: the androgen deprivation connection.', 'Response.', 'Response.', 'RE: Prostate-specific antigen screening trials and prostate cancer deaths: the androgen deprivation connection.', 'Reducing prostate cancer deaths: unsupported speculation about the androgen deprivation hypothesis.', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen-Based Screening for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Evidence Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.', 'Reducing prostate cancer deaths: unsupported speculation about the androgen deprivation hypothesis.', 'The utility of prostate-specific antigen in the management of advanced prostate cancer.', 'RE: Prostate-specific antigen screening trials and prostate cancer deaths: the androgen deprivation connection.', 'Re: Prostate-specific antigen screening trials and prostate cancer deaths: the androgen deprivation connection.', 'Could Differences in Treatment Between Trial Arms Explain the Reduction in Prostate Cancer Mortality in the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer?', 'Recent incidence and surgery trends for prostate cancer: Towards an attenuation of overdiagnosis and overtreatment?', 'The efficacy of prostate-specific antigen screening: Impact of key components in the ERSPC and PLCO trials.', 'Design-corrected variation by centre in mortality reduction in the ERSPC randomised prostate cancer screening trial.', 'Trends in prostate cancer incidence and mortality in Canada during the era of prostate-specific antigen screening.']"""

Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to investigate the correlation between NUCB2 mRNA expression and prognosis of PCa patients. The Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that the high expression of NUCB2 was related to the poor overall survival of patients with PCa.

Methods:   All patients with an ICD-10 psychiatric diagnosis, seeking care in 1982-2006 (25 years), were included. Data were drawn from the South Verona Psychiatric Case Register (PCR). Mortality and cause of death were ascertained using different procedures and sources. Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were used to compare the observed number of deaths with the expected number using as reference a population in the Veneto region.  Results:   Having been admitted to the hospital (SMR = 1.32), having a short interval from registration (1.52), having a diagnosis of alcoholism (2.03), and being a middle-aged male (1.83) were factors showing an increased risk of death from cancer. Increased SMRs were found for cancer of the oral cavity (22.93), lymphoma, leukemias, Hodgkin's lymphoma (8.01), and central nervous system (CNS) and cranial nerve tumors (4.75). The SMR decreased for stomach tumors (0.49). Patients with alcoholism (5.90 for larynx), affective disorders (20.00 for lymphomas), and personality disorders (28.00 for SNC) were found to be exposed to a high risk of cancer death in specific sites.  Conclusions:   Psychiatric patients showed different patterns of site-specific cancer mortality when compared with the general population.

This study was undertaken to determine the role of vimentin and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) in anticancer effects of SFN.  Methods:   Effect of SFN on levels of different proteins was determined by Western blotting or immunofluorescence microscopy. RNA interference of vimentin and PAI-1 was achieved by transient transfection. Apoptosis was quantified by flow cytometry. Transwell chambers were used to determine cell migration.  Results:   Exposure of PC-3 and DU145 human prostate cancer cells to SFN resulted in induction of vimentin protein, which was accompanied by down-regulation of E-cadherin protein expression. The SFN-mediated induction of vimentin was also observed in a normal human prostate epithelial cell line. RNA interference of vimentin did not have any appreciable effect on early or late apoptosis resulting from SFN exposure. On the other hand, SFN-mediated inhibition of PC-3 and DU145 cell migration was significantly augmented by knockdown of the vimentin protein. Knockdown of vimentin itself was inhibitory against cell migration. The SFN-treated cells also exhibited induction of PAI-1, which is an endogenous inhibitor of urokinase-type plasminogen activator system. Similar to vimentin, PAI-1 knockdown resulted in a modest augmentation of PC-3 cell migration inhibition by SFN. Tumors from SFN-treated transgenic adenocarcinoma of mouse prostate mice showed a 1.7-fold increase in vimentin protein level compared with control tumors.

Prior study shows iAs-induced malignant transformation in both arsenic methylation-proficient (liver) and methylation-deficient (prostate) cells, but only methylation-proficient cells show oxidative DNA damage (ODD) during this transformation. To further define whether arsenic methylation is necessary for transformation or ODD induction, here we chronically exposed these same liver or prostate cell lines to MMA(III) (0.25-1.0 μM) and tested for acquired malignant phenotype. Various metrics of oncogenic transformation were periodically assessed along with ODD during chronic MMA(III) exposure. Methylation-deficient and methylation-proficient cells both acquired a cancer phenotype with MMA(III) exposure at about 20 weeks, based on increased matrix metalloproteinase secretion, colony formation, and invasion. In contrast, prior work showed iAs-induced transformation took longer in biomethylation-deficient cells (~30 weeks) than in biomethylation-proficient cells (~18 weeks). In the present study, MMA(III) caused similar peak ODD levels at similar concentrations and at similar exposure times (18-22 weeks) in both cell types. At the approximate peak of ODD production, both cell types showed similar alterations in arsenic and oxidative stress adaptation factors (i.e., ABCC1, ABCC2, GST-π, SOD-1). Thus, MMA(III) causes oncogenic transformation associated with ODD in methylation-deficient cells, indicating that further methylation is not required to induce ODD. Together, these results show that MMA(III) and iAs cause an acquired malignant phenotype in methylation-deficient cells, yet iAs does not induce ODD.

In this study, we demonstrate that ceramide-deacylating enzyme acid ceramidase (AC) was preferentially upregulated in irradiated PCa cells. Radiation-induced AC gene transactivation by activator protein 1 (AP-1) binding on the proximal promoter was sensitive to inhibition of de novo ceramide biosynthesis, as demonstrated by promoter reporter and ChIP-qPCR analyses. Our data indicate that a protective feedback mechanism mitigates the apoptotic effect of IR-induced ceramide generation. We found that deregulation of c-Jun induced marked radiosensitization in vivo and in vitro, which was rescued by ectopic AC overexpression. AC overexpression in PCa clonogens that survived a fractionated 80-Gy IR course was associated with increased radioresistance and proliferation, suggesting a role for AC in radiotherapy failure and relapse. Immunohistochemical analysis of human PCa tissues revealed higher levels of AC after radiotherapy failure than those in therapy-naive PCa, prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, or benign tissues.

Our aim is to investigate if fusion of multiple atlases will lead to clinical workload reductions and more accurate segmentation proposals compared to the use of a single atlas segmentation, due to a more complete representation of the anatomical variations.  Methods:   Atlases for lymph node regions were constructed using 11 head and neck patients and 15 prostate patients based on published recommendations for segmentations. A commercial registration software (Velocity AI) was used to create individual segmentations through deformable registration. Ten head and neck patients, and ten prostate patients, all different from the atlas patients, were randomly chosen for the study from retrospective data. Each patient was first delineated three times, (a) manually by a radiation oncologist, (b) automatically using a single atlas segmentation proposal from a chosen atlas and (c) automatically by fusing the atlas proposals from all cases in the database using the probabilistic weighting fusion algorithm. In a subsequent step a radiation oncologist corrected the segmentation proposals achieved from step (b) and (c) without using the result from method (a) as reference. The time spent for editing the segmentations was recorded separately for each method and for each individual structure. Finally, the Dice Similarity Coefficient and the volume of the structures were used to evaluate the similarity between the structures delineated with the different methods.  Results:   For the single atlas method, the time reduction compared to manual segmentation was 29% and 23% for head and neck and pelvis lymph nodes, respectively, while editing the fused atlas proposal resulted in time reductions of 49% and 34%. The average volume of the fused atlas proposals was only 74% of the manual segmentation for the head and neck cases and 82% for the prostate cases due to a blurring effect from the fusion process. After editing of the proposals the resulting volume differences were no longer statistically significant, although a slight influence by the proposals could be noticed since the average edited volume was still slightly smaller than the manual segmentation, 9% and 5%, respectively.  Conclusions:   Segmentation based on fusion of multiple atlases reduces the time needed for delineation of lymph node regions compared to the use of a single atlas segmentation.

Methods:   Out of a total of 455 patients treated for PCa at our hospital between April 2003 and June 2011, 14 patients (3.1%) had been initially misdiagnosed as urinary bladder urothelial cell carcinoma.

Nine patients received TURP for hematuria or lower urinary tract blockage. The mean follow-up was 37 months, during which six patients survived.  Conclusions:   As clinical presentation and in emergency settings, prostate cancer originating from the prostate base can be confused with bladder cancer originating from the neck or the triangle region of the urinary bladder.

This study was conducted to calculate the radiation dose to organs-at-risk and estimate the probability of cancer induction from radiotherapy for HO prophylaxis.  Methods:   Hip irradiation for HO with a 6 MV photon beam was simulated with the aid of a Monte Carlo model. A realistic humanoid phantom representing an average adult patient was implemented in Monte Carlo environment for dosimetric calculations. The average out-of-field radiation dose to stomach, liver, lung, prostate, bladder, thyroid, breast, uterus, and ovary was calculated. The organ-equivalent-dose to colon, that was partly included within the treatment field, was also determined. Organ dose calculations were carried out using three different field sizes. The dependence of organ doses upon the block insertion into primary beam for shielding colon and prosthesis was investigated. The lifetime attributable risk for cancer development was estimated using organ, age, and gender-specific risk coefficients.  Results:   For a typical target dose of 7 Gy, organ doses varied from 1.0 to 741.1 mGy by the field dimensions and organ location relative to the field edge. Blocked field irradiations resulted in a dose range of 1.4-146.3 mGy. The most probable detriment from open field treatment of male patients was colon cancer with a high risk of 564.3 × 10(-5) to 837.4 × 10(-5) depending upon the organ dose magnitude and the patient's age. The corresponding colon cancer risk for female patients was (372.2-541.0) × 10(-5). The probability of bladder cancer development was more than 113.7 × 10(-5) and 110.3 × 10(-5) for males and females, respectively. The cancer risk range to other individual organs was reduced to (0.003-68.5) × 10(-5).

However, since zebrafish do not develop an adaptive immune system until 14 days post-fertilization, human cancer cells can survive and metastasize when transplanted into zebrafish larvae. Despite isolated reports, there has been no systematic evaluation of the robustness of this system to date.  Methods:   Individual cell lines were stained with CM-Dil and injected into the perivitelline space of 2-day old zebrafish larvae. After 2-4 days fish were imaged using confocal microscopy and the number of metastatic cells was determined using Fiji software.  Results:   To determine whether zebrafish can faithfully report metastatic potential in human cancer cells, we injected a series of cells with different metastatic potential into the perivitelline space of 2 day old embryos. Using cells from breast, prostate, colon and pancreas we demonstrated that the degree of cell metastasis in fish is proportional to their invasion potential in vitro. Highly metastatic cells such as MDA231, DU145, SW620 and ASPC-1 are seen in the vasculature and throughout the body of the fish after only 24-48 hours. Importantly, cells that are not invasive in vitro such as T47D, LNCaP and HT29 do not metastasize in fish. Inactivation of JAK1/2 in fibrosarcoma cells leads to loss of invasion in vitro and metastasis in vivo, and in zebrafish these cells show limited spread throughout the zebrafish body compared with the highly metastatic parental cells. Further, knockdown of WASF3 in DU145 cells which leads to loss of invasion in vitro and metastasis in vivo also results in suppression of metastasis in zebrafish. In a cancer progression model involving normal MCF10A breast epithelial cells, the degree of invasion/metastasis in vitro and in mice is mirrored in zebrafish. Using a modified version of Fiji software, it is possible to quantify individual metastatic cells in the transparent larvae to correlate with invasion potential. We also demonstrate, using lung cancers, that the zebrafish model can evaluate the metastatic ability of cancer cells isolated from primary tumors.  Conclusions:   The zebrafish model described here offers a rapid, robust, and inexpensive means of evaluating the metastatic potential of human cancer cells. Using this model it is possible to critically evaluate whether genetic manipulation of signaling pathways affects metastasis and whether primary tumors contain metastatic cells.""","""['Yong Teng', 'Xiayang Xie', 'Steven Walker', 'David T White', 'Jeff S Mumm', 'John K Cowell']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Inactivation of the WASF3 gene in prostate cancer cells leads to suppression of tumorigenicity and metastases.', 'HSP90 and HSP70 proteins are essential for stabilization and activation of WASF3 metastasis-promoting protein.', 'Metastatic behaviour of primary human tumours in a zebrafish xenotransplantation model.', 'Targeting WASF3 Signaling in Metastatic Cancer.', 'Zebrafish In Vivo Models of Cancer and Metastasis.', 'Non-POU Domain-Containing Octomer-Binding (NONO) protein expression and stability promotes the tumorigenicity and activation of Akt/MAPK/β-catenin pathways in human breast cancer cells.', 'S1P1 Threonine 236 Phosphorylation Mediates the Invasiveness of Triple-Negative Breast Cancer and Sensitivity to FTY720.', 'The mechanosensitive TRPV2 calcium channel promotes human melanoma invasiveness and metastatic potential.', 'Nutraceutical-Based Nanoformulations for Breast and Ovarian Cancer Treatment.', 'Zebrafish Models of Paediatric Brain Tumours.']"""

Selenium helps to protect the body from the poisonous effects of heavy metals and other harmful substances. Medical studies have provided evidence of selenium supplementation in preventing certain cancers. Low and too high selenium (Se) status correlates with increased risk of e.g. lung, larynx, colorectal and prostate cancers. A higher level of selenium and supplementation with selenium has been shown to be associated with substantially reduced cancer mortality. Selenium exerts its biological roles through selenoproteins, which are involved in oxidoreductions, redox signalling, antioxidant defence, thyroid hormone metabolism and immune responses. Checkpoint kinase 2 (CHEK2) is an important signal transducer of cellular responses to DNA damage and acts as a tumour suppressor gene. Mutations in the CHEK2 gene have been shown to be associated with increased risks of several cancers. Four common mutations in CHEK2 gene (1100delC, IVS2+1G>A, del5395 and I157T) have been identified in the Polish population. Studies have provided evidence that CHEK2-truncating and/or missense mutations are associated with increased risk of breast, prostate, thyroid, colon and kidney cancers. The variability in penetrance and cancer expression in CHEK2 mutation carriers can probably be explained by the influence of other genetic or environmental factors.

Methods:   Aiming at exploring the role of GLO1 in prostate cancer, we evaluated and targeted the expression of GLO1 in prostate cancer tissues and cell lines and analyzed its correlation with grading systems and tumor growth indices.  Results:   Immunohistochemical studies on 37 prostate cancer specimens revealed a positive correlation between Helpap-grading and the cytoplasmic (P = 0.002)/nuclear (P = 0.006) GLO1 level. A positive correlation between Ki-67 proliferation marker and the cytoplasmic GLO1 (P = 0.006) was evident. Furthermore, the highest GLO1 level was detected in the androgen-sensitive LNCaP compared to the androgen-independent Du-145 and PC-3 prostate cell lines and the breast cancer cell MCF-7, both at protein and mRNA level. Treating cancer cells with ethyl pyruvate was found to defang some malignancy-associated properties of cancer cells including proliferation, invasion and anchorage-independent growth. In vitro results revealed that the potency of ethyl pyruvate is increased when cells are metabolically activated by growth stimulators, for example, by fetal calf serum, dihydrotestosterone, tumor growth factor-β1 and leptin.  Conclusions:   The positive correlation of GLO1 expression level in prostate cancer tissues with the pathological grade and proliferation rate may assign GLO1 as a risk factor for prostate cancer development and progression.

Methods:   Primary human prostate cancer-associated (CAFs), and adjacent non-malignant (NPFs) fibroblasts isolated from human tissue specimens were analyzed using immunofluorescence, real-time PCR, and available array data. Cell culture and tissue recombination were used to determine responsiveness of human fibroblasts to Hh pathway manipulation and the paracrine effects of stromal Hh signaling, respectively.  Results:   Prostatic fibroblasts were capable of forming primary cilia, with the capacity for active Hh signaling as seen by Smo co-localization to the tip of the primary cilium. Expression of genes known to represent a signature of active Hh signaling in the prostate (especially Fgf5 and Igfbp6) were increased in CAFs compared to NPFs. The level of canonical Hh genes and prostate Hh signature genes were rarely synchronous; with lower doses of Purmorphamine/BMS-833923 regulating canonical transcription factors, and higher doses effecting prostate Hh signature genes. Grafts consisting of NPFs with constitutively active Hh signaling induced increased proliferation and dedifferentiation of adjacent non-malignant BPH-1 epithelial cells.

The present study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of combining radiation with low-dose docetaxel in DU-145 prostate cancer xenograft models.  Methods:   Male BALB/c nude mice bearing human DU-145 prostate tumors were assigned to four treatment groups: (1) control, (2) docetaxel (10 mg/kg/week, i.v., ×3 weeks), (3) radiation (2 Gy, q.d. ×5, ×3 weeks), (4) CCRT (the combination of docetaxel and radiation). Treatment efficacy was determined by tumor volume and tumor regression measurements. The extent of apoptosis in tumors in response to treatments was assessed via terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay. In addition, immunohistochemical staining of CD34 was done to quantify microvessel density in the tumors.  Results:   Our in vivo studies using DU-145 xenograft models in nude mice showed that CCRT compared to either alone significantly inhibited tumor growth, and the percentages of tumor regression were 32.6, 44.2, and 68.6 % for docetaxel, radiation, and CCRT, respectively. Moreover, CCRT did not significantly affected mice weight as compared to docetaxel or radiation alone. TUNEL assays showed that significantly more apoptotic cells were induced in the tumors treated with CCRT than either treatment alone. Anti-CD34 immunohistochemical staining indicated that CCRT significantly inhibited tumor angiogenesis.  Conclusion:   These findings suggest that CCRT with low-dose docetaxel inhibits the growth of DU-145 prostate cancer xenografts, by enhancing apoptosis and suppressing angiogenesis.

Although MOR is overexpressed in several human malignancies, the effect of chronic opioid requirement on cancer progression or survival has not been examined in humans.  Methods:   We performed a retrospective analysis on 113 patients identified in the Minneapolis VA Tumor Registry (test cohort) and 480 patients from the national VA Central Cancer Registry (validation cohort) who had been diagnosed with stage IV prostate cancer between 1995 and 2010 to examine whether MOR expression or opioid requirement is associated with disease progression and survival. All opioids were converted to oral morphine equivalents for comparison. Laser scanning confocal microscopy was used to analyze MOR immunoreactivity in prostate cancer biopsies. The effects of variables on outcomes were analyzed in univariable and multivariable models.  Results:   In patients with metastatic prostate cancer, MOR expression and opioid requirement were independently associated with inferior progression-free survival (hazard ratio [HR] 1.65, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.33-2.07, P<.001 and HR 1.08, 95% CI 1.03-1.13, P<.001, respectively) and overall survival (HR 1.55, 95% CI 1.20-1.99, P<.001 and HR 1.05, 95% CI 1.00-1.10, P = .031, respectively). The validation cohort confirmed that increasing opioid requirement was associated with worse overall survival (HR 1.005, 95% CI 1.002-1.008, P = .001).  Conclusion:   Higher MOR expression and greater opioid requirement are associated with shorter progression-free survival and overall survival in patients with metastatic prostate cancer. Nevertheless, clinical practice should not be changed until prospective randomized trials show that opioid use is associated with inferior clinical outcomes, and that abrogation of the peripheral activities of opioids ameliorates this effect.""","""['Dylan Zylla', 'Brett L Gourley', 'Derek Vang', 'Scott Jackson', 'Sonja Boatman', 'Bruce Lindgren', 'Michael A Kuskowski', 'Chap Le', 'Kalpna Gupta', 'Pankaj Gupta']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Cancer""","""['Impact of Pain, Opioids, and the Mu-opioid Receptor on Progression and Survival in Patients With Newly Diagnosed Stage IV Pancreatic Cancer.', 'Opioids and premature biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer: a randomised prospective clinical trial.', 'Treatment with methylnaltrexone is associated with increased survival in patients with advanced cancer.', 'Opioids and cancer prognosis: A summary of the clinical evidence.', 'Targeting the mu-Opioid Receptor for Cancer Treatment.', 'Involvement of the Opioid Peptide Family in Cancer Progression.', 'Angiotensin-Related Peptides and Their Role in Pain Regulation.', 'Mapping the Evidence for Opioid-Mediated Changes in Malignancy and Chemotherapeutic Efficacy: Protocol for a Scoping Review.', 'Mu opioid receptor mRNA overexpression predicts poor prognosis among 18 common solid cancers: A pan-cancer analysis.', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha: Implications of Anesthesia on Cancers.']"""

ACE PET/CT was performed as a double whole-body PET scan starting 5 and 22 min after injection (994 ± 72 MBq), and a late view (45 min) of the prostate bed. PET/CT scans were blindly reviewed by two independent pairs of two experienced nuclear medicine physicians, discordant subgroup results being discussed to reach a consensus for positive, negative end equivocal results.  Results:   PET results were concordant in 88 out of 92 local, regional and distant findings (Cohen's kappa 0.929). In particular, results were concordant in all patients concerning local status, bone metastases and distant findings. Lymph-node results were concordant in 19 patients and different in 4 patients. On a per-patient basis results were concordant in 22 of 23 patients (14 positive, 5 negative and 3 equivocal). In only one patient was ACE PET/CT positive for nodal metastases while FCH PET/CT was overall negative; interestingly, the ACE-positive and FCH-negative lymph nodes became positive in a second FCH PET/CT scan performed a few months later.  Conclusion:   Overall, ACE and FCH PET/CT showed excellent concordance, on both a per-lesion and a per-patient basis, suggesting that both tracers perform equally for recurrent prostate cancer staging.""","""['Franz Buchegger', 'Valentina Garibotto', 'Thomas Zilli', 'Laurent Allainmat', 'Sandra Jorcano', 'Hansjörg Vees', 'Olivier Rager', 'Charles Steiner', 'Habib Zaidi', 'Yann Seimbille', 'Osman Ratib', 'Raymond Miralbell']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging""","""['Is there a role for ¹¹C-choline PET/CT in the early detection of metastatic disease in surgically treated prostate cancer patients with a mild PSA increase <1.5 ng/ml?', 'More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Impact of 18F-choline PET/CT in prostate cancer patients with biochemical recurrence: influence of androgen deprivation therapy and correlation with PSA kinetics.', 'Acquisition with (11)C-choline and (18)F-fluorocholine PET/CT for patients with biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'The role of choline positron emission tomography/computed tomography in the management of patients with prostate-specific antigen progression after radical treatment of prostate cancer.', 'Recurrent prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy: restaging performance of 18F-choline hybrid PET/MRI.', 'Optimization of PET reconstruction algorithm, SUV thresholding algorithm and PET acquisition time in clinical 11C-acetate PET/CT.', 'Highlights of articles published in annals of nuclear medicine 2016.', 'Positron emission tomography (PET) in primary prostate cancer staging and risk assessment.', 'Multiparametric 11CAcetate positron emission tomography-magnetic resonance imaging in the assessment and staging of prostate cancer.']"""

Nine significant cooperative interactions emerged including both superadditive [22(R)-hydroxycholesterol and eicosatetraenoic acid] and subadditive [1α,25(OH)2D3 and chenodeoxycholic acid] cellular responses, which could be explained in part by cooperative control of cell-cycle progression and candidate gene expression. In addition, publicly available data were employed to assess NR expression in human prostate tissue.

After 6-18 months, hormone ablation treatment results in androgen-independent growth of cancer cells, metastasis and progression. The mechanism of androgen-independent growth of prostatic carcinoma cells is still unknown. Identification of factors that facilitate the transition from androgen-dependent to independent states is crucial in designing future diagnostics and medication strategies. To understand the biochemical meaning of hormone dependency deprivation, glycoproteins enriched profiles were compared between DU145 (hormone non-responding) and LNCaP (hormone responding) prostate cancer cells. These results allow for anticipation on the important role of glycosylation in malignant transformation. Both Tn antigen and complex antennary N-oligosaccharides were recognized. Their occurrence might be involved in the development and progression of tumor, and failure of hormone ablation therapy. Among identified proteins in androgen-sensitive cells nucleolin (P19338) was found that is widely described as apoptosis inhibitor, and also transporter of molecules from the membrane to the cytoplasm or nucleus. In addition, 14-3-3 protein family (P27348, P31946, P61981, P63104, P62258, Q04917, and P31947) was investigated across available databases as it forms stable complexes with glycoproteins. Our studies indicate that isoforms: sigma and eta were found in androgen-dependent prostate cancer cells, while other isoforms were present in androgen non-responding cells. 14-3-3 binding partners are involved in cancer pathogenesis. These findings may contribute to a better understanding of prostate cancer tumorigenesis and to a more efficient prognosis and individual therapy in a future. However, it still remains to be revealed how important those changes are for androgen dependency loss in prostate cancer patients carried out on clinically relevant populations.""","""['Anna Drabik', 'Dorota Ciołczyk-Wierzbicka', 'Joanna Dulińska-Litewka', 'Anna Bodzoń-Kułakowska', 'Piotr Suder', 'Jerzy Silberring', 'Piotr Laidler']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Mol Cell Biochem""","""['Erratum to: A comparative study of glycoproteomes in androgen-sensitive and -independent prostate cancer cell lines.', 'The biology of hormone refractory prostate cancer.

A call for increased survivorship care and provider training came from the Institute of Medicine (IOM) in the form of a landmark report in 2006. A shortage of physicians complicates the burden of survivorship care. The purpose of this effort was to design, develop, and evaluate a fully accredited, evidence-based continuing medical education (CME) and continuing education (CE) intervention to address the established knowledge gap for breast cancer, prostate cancer, colorectal cancer, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma survivorship education. Delivered through the Medscape Education (WebMD) platform, the course covered epidemiology, survivor issues, and currently available guidelines using illustrative patient cases. Knowledge gain was evaluated using a pretest-posttest design. Program evaluation was assessed by survey. Additional areas examined included post-intervention inquiry regarding expected changes to clinical practice. The results of this educational intervention demonstrated the effectiveness of internet-based CME/CE for cancer survivorship. Learning gain was significant (p < 0.0005). Effect size (d = 1.71) suggested extremely high practical significance, as the difference between the means was larger than 1 standard deviation. Significant knowledge gains were observed for each survivorship knowledge question across all clinical specialties studied. Nearly 100% of participants agreed that the course contributed to survivorship care and was organized effectively.

EV trafficking leads to changes in cellular function including apoptosis, angiogenesis and proliferation required for increased tumor formation.  Results:   We report several phenotypic changes mediated by EVs isolated from non-malignant and malignant prostate cells as well as patient biopsied prostate tumor samples. EVs can reverse the resistance of prostate cancer cells to camptothecin EVs isolated from non-malignant PrECs (Prostate Epithelial Cells) can reverse soft agar colony formation of malignant DU145 cells, with the reciprocal effect observed. Isolation of EVs from 2 Gleason grade 8 prostate cancer patients significantly induced soft agar colony formation of non-malignant PrECs. We have identified proteins via antibody and Mass spectrometry analysis that may be responsible for the phenotypic changes. Mass spectrometry analysis of protein lysates using ProteoIQ revealed protein candidates associated with gene ontology annotations that may be responsible for this phenotypic change. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis was used to identify statistically relevant canonical pathways and functions associated the protein IDs and expression values obtained using ProteoIQ. Western blot analysis confirmed the increase of 14-3-3 zeta, pRKIP and prohibitin protein levels in PrEC cells co-cultured with patient EVs. 14-3-3 proteins were also found as common proteins of 3 other Gleason grade 8 patients.

In this study we show also that CKβBP2/CRIF1 inhibits wild-type AR and AR N-terminal transcriptional activity, binds to the AR C-terminal region, inhibits interaction of the AR N- and C-terminal domains (N/C interaction) and competes with p160 coactivator binding to the AR C-terminal domain, suggesting CKβBP2/CRIF1 interferes with AR activation functions 1 and 2. CKβBP2/CRIF1 is expressed mainly in stromal cells of benign prostatic hyperplasia and in stroma and epithelium of prostate cancer. CKβBP2/CRIF1 protein is increased in epithelium of androgen-dependent prostate cancer compared to benign prostatic hyperplasia and decreased slightly in castration recurrent epithelium compared to androgen-dependent prostate cancer. The multifunctional CKβBP2/CRIF1 is a STAT3 interacting protein and reported to be a coactivator of STAT3.

The assay measures expression of 12 cancer-related genes representing four biological pathways and 5 reference genes which are algorithmically combined to calculate the Genomic Prostate Score (GPS). This biopsy-based assay has been analytically and subsequently clinically validated as a predictor of aggressive prostate cancer. The aim of this study was to validate the analytical performance of the Oncotype DX Prostate Cancer Assay using predefined acceptance criteria.  Results:   The lowest quartile of RNA yields from prostate needle biopsies (six 5 μm sections) was between 19 and 34 ng. Analytical validation of the process requiring as little as 5 ng of RNA met all pre-defined acceptance criteria. Amplification efficiencies, analytical sensitivity, and accuracy of gene assays were measured by serially diluting an RNA sample and analyzing features of the linear regression between RNA expression measured by the crossing point (Cp) versus the log2 of the RNA input per PCR assay well. Gene assays were shown to accurately measure expression over a wide range of inputs (from as low as 0.005 ng to 320 ng). Analytical accuracy was excellent with average biases at qPCR inputs representative of patient samples <9.7% across all assays while amplification efficiencies were within ±6% of the median. Assessments of reproducibility and precision were performed by testing 10 prostate cancer RNA samples over multiple instruments, reagent lots, operators, days (precision), and RNA input levels (reproducibility) using appropriately parameterized linear mixed models. The standard deviations for analytical precision and reproducibility were 1.86 and 2.11 GPS units (100-unit scale) respectively.  Conclusions:   The Oncotype DX Prostate Cancer Assay, a clinical RT-PCR assay specifically designed for use with prostate needle biopsies, has been analytically validated using very limited RNA inputs.

Method and results:   A web-based survey to European Network of Uropathology members received replies from 266 pathologists in 22 countries. Eighty-nine per cent claimed to follow ISUP recommendations. Key areas of disagreement included the following.

Any amount of secondary pattern of higher grade in needle biopsies was included in the Gleason score by 58%. Tertiary GP of higher grade on needle biopsies was included in the Gleason score by only 58%. If biopsy cores were embedded separately, only 56% would give a Gleason score for each core/slide examined; 68% would give a concluding Gleason score and the most common method was a global Gleason score (77%). Among those who blocked multiple biopsy cores together, 46% would only give an overall Gleason score for the case.

We characterize the cancer phenotypic state as a shared response of a set of mRNA or microRNAs (miRNAs) in cancer patients versus noncancer controls. The resulting signature is robust with respect to individual patient variability and distinguishes with high fidelity between cancer and noncancer patients. The mRNAs and miRNAs that are implicated in the signature are correlated and are known to contribute to the regulation of cancer-signaling pathways. The miRNA and mRNA networks are common to the noncancer and cancer patients, but the disease modulates the strength of the connectivities. Furthermore, we experimentally assessed the cancer-specific signatures as possible therapeutic targets. Specifically we restructured a single dominant connectivity in the cancer-specific gene network in vitro. We find a deflection from the cancer phenotype, significantly reducing cancer cell proliferation and altering cancer cellular physiology. Our approach is grounded in thermodynamics augmented by information theory. The thermodynamic reasoning is demonstrated to ensure that the derived signature is bias-free and shows that the most significant redistribution of free energy occurs in programming a system between the noncancer and cancer states.

Thus, endocrine therapies that inhibit the AR ligand-binding domain (LBD) are effective in treating PCa. AR transcriptional reactivation is central to resistance, as evidenced by the efficacy of AR retargeting in castration-resistant PCa (CRPC) with next-generation endocrine therapies abiraterone and enzalutamide. However, resistance to abiraterone and enzalutamide limits this efficacy in most men, and PCa remains the second-leading cause of male cancer deaths. Here we show that AR gene rearrangements in CRPC tissues underlie a completely androgen-independent, yet AR-dependent, resistance mechanism. We discovered intragenic AR gene rearrangements in CRPC tissues, which we modeled using transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN)-mediated genome engineering. This modeling revealed that these AR gene rearrangements blocked full-length AR synthesis, but promoted expression of truncated AR variant proteins lacking the AR ligand-binding domain. Furthermore, these AR variant proteins maintained the constitutive activity of the AR transcriptional program and a CRPC growth phenotype independent of full-length AR or androgens. These findings demonstrate that AR gene rearrangements are a unique resistance mechanism by which AR transcriptional activity can be uncoupled from endocrine regulation in CRPC.""","""['Michael D Nyquist', 'Yingming Li', 'Tae Hyun Hwang', 'Luke S Manlove', 'Robert L Vessella', 'Kevin A T Silverstein', 'Daniel F Voytas', 'Scott M Dehm']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A""","""['Re: TALEN-engineered AR gene rearrangements reveal endocrine uncoupling of androgen receptor in prostate cancer.', 'AR-V7 and resistance to enzalutamide and abiraterone in prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptor splice variants mediate enzalutamide resistance in castration-resistant prostate cancer cell lines.', 'Distinct transcriptional programs mediated by the ligand-dependent full-length androgen receptor and its splice variants in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptor splice variants in the era of enzalutamide and abiraterone.', 'Androgen Receptor Rearrangement and Splicing Variants in Resistance to Endocrine Therapies in Prostate Cancer.', 'Saracatinib synergizes with enzalutamide to downregulate AR activity in CRPC.', 'Computational drug discovery for castration-resistant prostate cancers through in vitro drug response modeling.', 'DAXX drives de novo lipogenesis and contributes to tumorigenesis.', 'Racial Differences in Androgen Receptor (AR) and AR Splice Variants (AR-SVs) Expression in Treatment-Naïve Androgen-Dependent Prostate Cancer.', 'Potent Stimulation of the Androgen Receptor Instigates a Viral Mimicry Response in Prostate Cancer.']"""

In an effort to establish a human model of prostate carcinogenesis, we adapted premalignant human prostate EPT2-D5 cells to protein-free medium to generate numerous tight prostate spheres (D5HS) in monolayer culture. In contrast to EPT2-D5 cells, the newly generated D5HS efficiently formed large subcutaneous tumors and subsequent metastases in vivo, showing the tumorigenicity of D5HS spheres. A striking production of interleukin (IL)-6 mRNA and protein was found in D5HS cells. The essential roles of IL-6 and the downstream STAT3 signaling in D5HS tumor sphere formation were confirmed by neutralizing antibody, chemical inhibitors, and fluorescent pathway reporter. In addition, elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced upon protein depletion was required for the activation of IL-6/STAT3 in D5HS. Importantly, a positive feedback loop was found between ROS and IL-6 during tumor sphere formation. The association of ROS/IL-6/STAT3 to the carcinogenesis of human prostate cells was further examined in xenograft tumors and verified by limiting dilution implantations.

The objective of this analysis was to evaluate post-treatment PSA kinetics as surrogates for OS in patients receiving second-line chemotherapy.  Patients and methods:   Data from a phase III trial of patients with mCRPC randomly assigned to cabazitaxel plus prednisone (C + P) or mitoxantrone plus prednisone were used. PSA decline (≥ 30% and ≥ 50%), velocity, and rise within the first 3 months of treatment were evaluated as surrogates for OS. The Prentice criteria, proportion of treatment explained (PTE), and meta-analytic approaches were used as measures of surrogacy.  Results:   The observed hazard ratio (HR) for death for patients treated with C + P was 0.66 (95% CI, 0.55 to 0.79; P < .001). Furthermore, a ≥ 30% decline in PSA was a statistically significant predictor of OS (HR for death, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.43 to 0.64; P < .001). Adjusting for treatment effect, the HR for a ≥ 30% PSA decline was 0.50 (95% CI, 0.40 to 0.62; P < .001), but treatment remained statistically significant, thus failing the third Prentice criterion. The PTE for a ≥ 30% decline in PSA was 0.34 (95% CI, 0.11 to 0.56), indicating a lack of surrogacy for OS. The values of R(2) were < 1, suggesting that PSA decline was not surrogate for OS.  Conclusion:   Surrogacy for any PSA-based end point could not be demonstrated in this analysis. Thus, the benefits of cabazitaxel in mediating a survival benefit are not fully captured by early PSA changes.""","""['Susan Halabi', 'Andrew J Armstrong', 'Oliver Sartor', 'Johann de Bono', 'Ellen Kaplan', 'Chen-Yen Lin', 'Nicole C Solomon', 'Eric J Small']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Clin Oncol""","""['Clinical outcomes and survival surrogacy studies of prostate-specific antigen declines following enzalutamide in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer previously treated with docetaxel.', 'Severe neutropenia during cabazitaxel treatment is associated with survival benefit in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC): A post-hoc analysis of the TROPIC phase III trial.', 'Prostate-specific Antigen Decline After 4 Weeks of Treatment with Abiraterone Acetate and Overall Survival in Patients with Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Oncologic Response and Hospitalization Rate of Patients Receiving Cabazitaxel in the Fourth-Line and Beyond in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: Analysis of a Retrospective Cohort and a Structured Literature Review.', 'PSA response rate as a surrogate marker for median overall survival in docetaxel-based first-line treatments for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: an analysis of 22 trials.', 'Early PSA Change after 177LuPSMA-617 Radioligand Therapy as a Predicator of Biochemical Response and Overall Survival.', 'ALP bouncing and LDH normalization in bone metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients under therapy with Enzalutamide: an exploratory analysis.', 'Unified exact design with early stopping rules for single arm clinical trials with multiple endpoints.', 'Value of Early Circulating Tumor Cells Dynamics to Estimate Docetaxel Benefit in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC) Patients.', 'Interim and end-treatment 18F-Fluorocholine PET/CT and bone scan in prostate cancer patients treated with Radium 223 dichloride.']"""

Secondarily, toxicity was assessed.  Results:   There were 303 assessable patients with a median follow-up of 68.4 months. No significant differences were seen between the treatment arms in terms of the distribution of patients by clinicopathologic or treatment-related (ADT use and length) factors.

There were no statistically significant differences in late toxicity between the arms; however, in subgroup analysis, patients with compromised urinary function before enrollment had significantly worse urinary function after HIMRT.

The increased cell proliferation, angiogenesis and hypoxia are main features of tumor tissues. The present study aimed to characterize the expression of TXNDC5 in various tumor types and to investigate the role of TXNDC5 in the growth, proliferation and migration of tumor cells. The study also determined susceptibility of TXNDC5 gene on tumor risk. The expression of TXNDC5 in tumor tissues was determined by immunohistochemistry using a tissue array that contained various types of tumor tissues. The expression levels of TXNDC5 in tumor tissues and healthy tissues were quantitatively analyzed using western blotting. Furthermore, HeLa cells and U2OS cells were treated with anti-TXNDC5 siRNA to knockdown the expression levels of TXNDC5 to study its role in cell proliferation and migration. The cell proliferation and migration of the transfected tumor cells were determined by MTT and Transwell migration assays, respectively. Ninety-six tag SNPs across the TXNDC5 locus were genotyped using custom‑designed Illumina 384-SNP VeraCode microarrays. Our immunohistochemical staining revealed significant expression of TXNDC5 in breast invasive ductal carcinomas, cervical squamous cell carcinomas, esophageal squamous cell carcinomas, gastric carcinomas, hepatocellular carcinomas, ovarian papillary serous carcinomas, prostate cancers and undifferentiated cell carcinomas of the lung. Western blot analysis also detected significantly higher TXNDC5 expression in tumor tissues of breast cancers, gastric adenocarcinomas and rectal cancers compared to the adjacent healthy tissues. Decreased growth and invasive potential were observed in cultured HeLa cells and U2OS cells when TXNDC5 gene expression was knocked down. The case-control analysis showed a significant difference in allele frequency and genotype frequency for rs9505298, rs7771314, rs2815128, rs13210097 and rs9392182 between cervical carcinoma, esophageal carcinoma and liver cancer patients and controls.

Time to castrate-resistant PC (CRPC), metastases and PC-specific mortality were explored as secondary outcomes using unadjusted analyses.  Results:   Of 371 diabetic men, 156 (42%) were using metformin before RP. Metformin use was associated with more recent year of surgery (P<0.0001) but no clinical or pathologic characteristics.

This study explores whether PSADT calculations are influenced by frequency/duration of PSA measurements, and whether statistical variability leads investigators to find false significant results.  Methods:   In retrospective analyses of two BRPC cohorts: Johns Hopkins Hospital (JHH) patients who deferred therapy and placebo patients on a randomized clinical trial (RCT), we calculated changes in PSADT from early measurements to later measurements using subsets of available PSAs for patients with ≥6 and ≥9 PSAs. We simulated hypothetical single-arm trials using randomly selected, 50-patient subsets and simulated two-arm RCTs.  Results:   JHH cohort (n=205) had median follow-up 58 months, median age 61 years and median Gleason 7. PSA variability changed with duration of PSA measurement as median within-patient PSADT increases for men with >6 PSAs ranged from 1.0 to 1.4 months by PSA subset while increases for men with ≥9 PSAs ranged from 3.9 to 4.1 months. Frequency of measurement did not change PSA variability as PSADT increase was unchanged when odd values were used instead of all values. Approximately 30% of JHH men experienced >200% increases in PSADT. Up to 62% of 50-patient single-arm simulations detected a significant PSADT change, whereas simulated RCTs did not. Results were supported in the RCT placebo cohort; 46% of patients experienced PSADT increases >200%.  Conclusions:   These data suggest that calculated PSADT in BRPC may naturally increase over time in the absence of therapy and may be influenced by duration of PSA follow-up. As a result, single-arm trials could show false significant increases despite the lack of active treatment of these patients. Placebo-controlled RCTs including clinical end points are recommended to screen novel agents in men with BRPC to mitigate bias because of natural PSADT variability.""","""['C J Paller', 'D Olatoye', 'S Xie', 'X Zhou', 'S R Denmeade', 'M A Eisenberger', 'E S Antonarakis', 'M A Carducci', 'G L Rosner']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['PSA Doubling Time and Absolute PSA Predict Metastasis-free Survival in Men With Biochemically Recurrent Prostate Cancer After Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Is there a role for ¹¹C-choline PET/CT in the early detection of metastatic disease in surgically treated prostate cancer patients with a mild PSA increase <1.5 ng/ml?', 'Prostate-specific antigen doubling time predicts clinical outcome and survival in prostate cancer patients treated with combined radiation and hormone therapy.', 'Markers and meaning of primary treatment failure.', 'PSA and follow-up after treatment of prostate cancer.', 'Modified Citrus Pectin Treatment in Non-Metastatic Biochemically Relapsed Prostate Cancer: Results of a Prospective Phase II Study.', 'IL-7 expands lymphocyte populations and enhances immune responses to sipuleucel-T in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).', 'Implementation of repeat biopsy and detection of cancer after a diagnosis of atypical small acinar proliferation of the prostate.', 'Phase II Trial of Acai Juice Product in Biochemically Recurrent Prostate Cancer.', 'Undetectable prostate-specific antigen after short-course androgen deprivation therapy for biochemically recurrent patients correlates with metastasis-free survival and prostate cancer-specific survival.']"""

Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels are commonly measured for the early detection of PCa, but which itself is still not an ideal biomarker. We analysed the expression patterns of prostate cancer susceptibility candidate (PRAC) in prostate cancer. The PRAC gene is known to be commonly expressed in prostate tissue, rectum and colon. To provide clear insights into the expression patterns of PRAC in PCa, we examined the gene expression by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry (IHC). The results showed that PRAC expression levels in androgen‑insensitive cells (DU145 and PC3) are lower than those in androgen-sensitive cell lines (LNCaP, LNCaP-R and CW22R). However, treatment of the LNCaP cell line with androgen and anti-androgen demonstrated that PRAC is expressed in an androgen-independent manner. Further, PRAC expression was restored upon treatment of DU145 and PC3 cells with the methyltransferase inhibitor, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-aza-CdR), which indicates the effect of methylation in the control of PRAC expression. In addition, IHC analysis revealed a significantly decreased immunoreactivity of PRAC protein in PCa tissues compared to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) (p<0.0001). Thus, our findings suggest that the pathogenesis of PCa may be due to the expression levels of PRAC protein, and this protein can serve as a potential biomarker for the management of PCa.""","""['Govinda Lenka', 'Wen-Hui Weng', 'Cheng-Keng Chuang', 'Kwai-Fong Ng', 'See-Tong Pang']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Int J Oncol""","""['Testis specific Y-like 5: gene expression, methylation and implications for drug sensitivity in prostate carcinoma.', 'Progression to metastatic stage in a cellular model of prostate cancer is associated with methylation of the androgen receptor gene and transcriptional suppression of the insulin-like growth factor-I receptor gene.', ""Targeting the unique methylation pattern of androgen receptor (AR) promoter in prostate stem/progenitor cells with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-AZA) leads to suppressed prostate tumorigenesis."", 'Combination of resveratrol and antiandrogen flutamide has synergistic effect on androgen receptor inhibition in prostate cancer cells.', 'Androgen receptor as a regulator of ZEB2 expression and its implications in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in prostate cancer.', 'TIM-3 Expression Is Downregulated on Human NK Cells in Response to Cancer Targets in Synergy with Activation.', 'Detection of Prostate Cancer Antigen 3 and Prostate Cancer Susceptibility Candidate in Non-DRE Urine Improves Diagnosis of Prostate Cancer in Chinese Population.', 'Incorporating genetic networks into case-control association studies with high-dimensional DNA methylation data.', 'Isolation and functional interrogation of adult human prostate epithelial stem cells at single cell resolution.', 'Identification of Methylation-Driven, Differentially Expressed STXBP6 as a Novel Biomarker in Lung Adenocarcinoma.']"""

Experimental design:   Androgen-dependent and -independent prostate cancer models were used to investigate the role and mechanisms of adrenomedullin in prostate cancer hormone-independent growth and tumor-associated angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis.  Results:   Adrenomedullin and AMR were immunohistochemically localized in the carcinomatous epithelial compartment of prostate cancer specimens of high grade (Gleason score >7), suggesting a role of the adrenomedullin system in prostate cancer growth. We used the androgen-independent Du145 cells, for which we demonstrate that adrenomedullin stimulated cell proliferation in vitro through the cAMP/CRAF/MEK/ERK pathway. The proliferation of Du145 and PC3 cells is decreased by anti-adrenomedullin antibody (αAM), supporting the fact that adrenomedullin may function as a potent autocrine/paracrine growth factor for prostate cancer androgen-independent cells. In vivo, αAM therapy inhibits the growth of Du145 androgen-independent xenografts and interestingly of LNCaP androgen-dependent xenografts only in castrated animals, suggesting strongly that adrenomedullin might play an important role in tumor regrowth following androgen ablation. Histologic examination of αAM-treated tumors showed evidence of disruption of tumor vascularity, with depletion of vascular as well as lymphatic endothelial cells and pericytes, and increased lymphatic endothelial cell apoptosis. Importantly, αAM potently blocks tumor-associated lymphangiogenesis, but does not affect established vasculature and lymphatic vessels in normal adult mice.  Conclusions:   We conclude that expression of adrenomedullin upon androgen ablation in prostate cancer plays an important role in hormone-independent tumor growth and in neovascularization by supplying/amplifying signals essential for pathologic neoangiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis.

This study investigated the effects of a novel analogue of resveratrol, HS-1793, on the expression of HIF-1α and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in PC-3 human prostate cancer cells. Hypoxic condition induced HIF-1α protein level in PC-3 cells in a time-dependent manner, and treatment with HS-1793 markedly decreased HIF-1α expression levels. HS-1793 also inhibited VEGF level. Mechanistically, HS-1793 inhibited HIF-1α and VEGF expression through multiple mechanisms. Firstly, HS-1793 inhibited phosphorylation of PI3K and Akt in PC-3 cells. Furthermore, HS-1793 substantially induced HIF-1α protein degradation through the proteasome pathway. Finally, HS-1793 inhibited hypoxia-induced PC-3 cell migration. These data suggest that HS-1793 may inhibit human prostate cancer progression and angiogenesis by inhibiting the expression of HIF-1α and VEGF. Moreover, HS-1793 showed more potent effects than resveratrol on the cytotoxic effects on PC-3 cells.

Among the seven STAT family proteins, STAT3 is constitutively activated in many diverse cancers. Upon activation, JAK and Src kinases phosphorylate STAT3, and thereby promote cell growth and survival. MLS-2384 is a novel 6-bromoindirubin derivative with a bromo-group at the 6-position on one indole ring and a hydrophilic group at the 3'-position on the other indole ring. In this study, we investigated the kinase inhibitory activity and anticancer activity of MLS-2384. Our data from in vitro kinase assays, cell viability analyses, western blotting analyses, and animal model studies, demonstrate that MLS-2384 is a dual JAK/Src kinase inhibitor, and suppresses growth of various human cancer cells, such as prostate, breast, skin, ovarian, lung, and liver. Consistent with the inactivation of JAK and Src kinases, phosphorylation of STAT3 was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner in the cancer cells treated with MLS-2384. STAT3 downstream proteins involved in cell proliferation and survival, such as c-Myc and Mcl-1, are downregulated by MLS-2384 in prostate cancer cells, whereas survivin is downregulated in A2058 cells. In these two cancer cell lines, PARP is cleaved, indicating that MLS-2384 induces apoptosis in human melanoma and prostate cancer cells. Importantly, MLS-2384 suppresses tumor growth with low toxicity in a mouse xenograft model of human melanoma. Taken together, MLS-2384 demonstrates dual JAK/Src inhibitory activity and suppresses tumor cell growth both in vitro and in vivo.

The objective of the present study was to investigate the regulatory mechanism of TRAF4 expression in prostate cancer. We initially identified microRNA-29a (miR‑29a) as a possible candidate to bind TRAF4 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) by the algorithm, TargetScan. The expression of TRAF4 mRNA and protein was inversely associated with miR-29a expression in prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP, DU145 and PC3). TRAF4 expression was reduced by the introduction of mimic miR-29a in LNCaP cells. Luciferase activity from the construct harboring wild-type TRAF4 3'UTR was reduced by the mimic miR-29a and this reduction was diminished by introducing mutations at the predicted miR-29a binding site. On the other hand, TRAF4 was upregulated when transfected with the inhibitor of miR-29a in DU145 and PC3 cells. TRAF4 was significantly upregulated in patients with metastatic prostate cancer compared to those with localized prostate cancer. Furthermore, there was a significant inverse correlation between TRAF4 and miR-29a expression in tumor tissues from radical prostatectomy.

In this study, mechanisms of cell death induced by sodium meta-arsenite were investigated. Sodium meta-arsenite reduced cell viability and increased the sub-G1 population in cell cycle analysis in both androgen-sensitive LNCaP and androgen-insensitive CWR22RV1 cells. The apoptosis induced by sodium meta-arsenite was associated with cleavage of caspases 3, 8, and 9, and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and increased annexin V-positive cells, and was inhibited by the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk. Sodium meta-arsenite also increased the level of the autophagy marker microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3)-II and the number of autophagic vacuoles as shown by electron microscopy. Both the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine and the necrosis inhibitor necrostatin-1 blocked cell death induced by sodium meta-arsenite. Moreover, sodium meta-arsenite led to the accumulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), a ROS scavenger, decreased sodium meta-arsenite-induced levels of cleaved PARP and LC3-II. Propidium iodide (PI) staining also showed that NAC restored membrane integrity, damaged by sodium meta-arsenite.

Bipartite NLS activity depends on the structure provided by the DBD, and protein interactions with the bipartite NLS are repressed by the hinge region. The bipartite NLS is recognized by importin 7, a nuclear import receptor for several proteins. Importin 7 binding to AR, however, inhibits import by shielding the bipartite NLS. Androgen binding relieves the inhibition by inducing a switch that promotes exchange of importin 7 for karyopherin alpha import receptors.

The anterior rectal wall is at the greatest risk of injury as it lies closest to the target volume and receives the highest dose of RT. This study evaluated the absolute volume of anterior rectal wall receiving a high dose to identify potential ideal dose constraints that can minimize rectal AEs. A total of 111 consecutive patients with Stage T1c to T3a N0 M0 prostate cancer who underwent image-guided intensity-modulated RT at our institution were included. AEs were graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0. The volume of anterior rectal wall receiving 5 to 80Gy in 2.5-Gy increments was determined. Multivariable Cox regression models were used to identify cut points in these volumes that led to an increased risk of early and late rectal AEs. Early AEs occurred in most patients (88%); however, relatively few of them (13%) were grade ≥2. At 5 years, the cumulative incidence of late rectal AEs was 37%, with only 5% being grade ≥2. For almost all RT doses, we identified a threshold of irradiated absolute volume of anterior rectal wall above which there was at least a trend toward a significantly higher rate of AEs. Most strikingly, patients with more than 1.29, 0.73, or 0.45cm(3) of anterior rectal wall exposed to radiation doses of 67.5, 70, or 72.5Gy, respectively, had a significantly increased risk of late AEs (relative risks [RR]: 2.18 to 2.72; p ≤ 0.041) and of grade ≥ 2 early AEs (RR: 6.36 to 6.48; p = 0.004).

Oxaliplatin and pemetrexed have each shown modest activity in the treatment of CRPC. Given their favorable nonoverlapping toxicity profiles, we studied them in combination.  Patients and methods:   Men with CRPC whose disease had progressed on 1 or 2 previous chemotherapy regimens, including a taxane, were eligible. All participants received oxaliplatin 120 mg/m(2) and pemetrexed 500 mg/m(2) intravenously every 21 days. The primary end point was response rate; objective responses were determined using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), version 1.0, criteria and the Prostate Cancer Working Group (1999) criteria. Secondary end points included progression-free survival and OS.  Results:   Forty-seven men received a median of 6 cycles (range, 1-21). The overall response rate was 30% (95% confidence interval [CI], 18%-45%), including 10 men with RECIST responses of the 40 who had measurable disease (25%). Overall, 64% had a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) decline and 74% of men had clinical disease control (partial response or stable disease as their best response). Median progression-free survival was 5.8 months (95% CI, 3.8-7.6), with a median OS of 11.9 months. Six of 15 evaluable patients (40%) experienced a pain response. Nineteen patients (40%) experienced a grade 3 or 4 hematologic toxicity, and 16 (34%) experienced a grade 3 nonhematologic toxicity. One patient died while participating in the study.

We present a series of 670 consecutive samples of urine collected post-prostatic massage for three years in which we determined the ""PCA3 score"" (s-PCA3).

Abiraterone acetate (AA), a selective androgen biosynthesis inhibitor, in combination with low-dose prednisone (P) improved overall survival (OS) in a randomised trial in mCRPC progressing after docetaxel versus placebo (PL) plus P.  Objective:   To examine the efficacy and safety of AA plus P versus PL plus P in subgroups of elderly (aged ≥ 75 yr) (n=331) and younger patients (<75 yr) (n=863).  Design, setting, and participants:   We conducted a post hoc analysis of a randomised double-blind PL-controlled study in mCRPC patients progressing after docetaxel chemotherapy.  Intervention:   Patients were randomised 2:1 to AA (1000 mg) plus low-dose P (5mg twice daily) (n=797) or PL plus P (n=398).  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Primary end point was OS. Secondary end points were time to prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression (TTPP), radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS), and PSA response rate. Treatment differences were compared using the stratified log-rank test. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). The key limitation was the post hoc analysis.  Results and limitations:   Elderly patients treated with AA plus P showed improved OS (HR: 0.64; 95% CI, 0.478-0.853; p=0.0022), TTPP (HR: 0.76; 95% CI, 0.503-1.155; p=0.1995), and rPFS (HR: 0.66; 95% CI, 0.506-0.859; p=0.0019), and higher PSA response rate with relative risk (HR: 4.15; 95% CI, 2.2-8.0]; p ≤ 0.0001) compared with patients treated with PL plus P. Grade 3/4 adverse events occurred in 62% of elderly patients and in 60% of patients aged <75 yr treated with AA plus P. Incidences of hypertension and hypokalaemia, although increased in the AA plus P arm, were similar in both age subgroups and readily managed.  Conclusions:   AA improves OS and is well tolerated in both elderly patients and younger patients with mCRPC following docetaxel, hence providing an important treatment option for elderly patients who may not tolerate alternative therapies with greater toxicity.

The commonest cause of death is locally advanced/recurrent disease. Consequently, there is an unmet need for new approaches to improve local control in HNSCC. T4 immunotherapy is an autologous cell therapy in which peripheral blood T-cells are genetically engineered using a retroviral vector to coexpress two chimeric receptors: (i) T1E28z is a chimeric antigen receptor that engages multiple ErbB dimers that are commonly upregulated in HNSCC; (ii) 4αβ is a chimeric cytokine receptor that converts the weak mitogenic stimulus provided by interleukin (IL)-4 into a strong and selective growth signal, allowing preferential expansion and enrichment of T4(+) T-cells ex vivo. T4 immunotherapy exerts antitumor activity against HNSCC cell lines and tumors in vivo, without significant toxicity. Human T4(+) T-cells also engage mouse ErbB receptors, permitting safety testing in SCID Beige mice. Severe toxicity caused by cytokine release syndrome ensues when human T4(+) T-cells are administered at high doses to mice, particularly with advanced tumor burdens. However, such toxicity is not required for efficacy and is never seen if T-cells are administered by the intratumoral route. To exploit this, we have designed a first-in-man clinical trial in which T4(+) T-cells are administered to patients with locally advanced/recurrent HNSCC. Cells will be administered at a single sitting to multiple sites around the viable tumor circumference. A 3+3 dose escalation design will be used, starting at 10(7) cells (cohort 1), escalating to 10(9) cells (cohort 5). If maximum tolerated dose remains undefined, cohorts 6/7 will receive either low- or high-dose cyclophosphamide before 10(9) T4(+) T-cells. A panel of routine/in-house assays and imaging techniques will be used to monitor safety, efficacy, perturbation of endogenous antitumor immunity, immunogenicity, and T-cell trafficking.""","""['May C I van Schalkwyk', 'Sophie E Papa', 'Jean-Pierre Jeannon', 'Teresa Guerrero Urbano', 'James F Spicer', 'John Maher']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Hum Gene Ther Clin Dev""","""['Clinical Evaluation of ErbB-Targeted CAR T-Cells, Following Intracavity Delivery in Patients with ErbB-Expressing Solid Tumors.', ""Intracavitary 'T4 immunotherapy' of malignant mesothelioma using pan-ErbB re-targeted CAR T-cells."", 'Preclinical in vivo modeling of cytokine release syndrome induced by ErbB-retargeted human T cells: identifying a window of therapeutic opportunity?', 'Current Prospects of Molecular Therapeutics in Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma.', 'Immuno-oncology in head and neck squamous cell cancers: News from clinical trials, emerging predictive factors and unmet needs.', 'Recent advances and future perspectives of CAR-T cell therapy in head and neck cancer.', 'Recurrent/Metastatic Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Treatment from Present to Future: Where Are We and Where Are We Heading?', 'Advances in CAR-T Cell Therapy in Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma.', 'CAR-T Cells in the Treatment of Ovarian Cancer: A Promising Cell Therapy.', 'T cell effects and mechanisms in immunotherapy of head and neck tumors.']"""

However, the mechanisms of PTEN regulation still need further investigation. We here report that a combination of four microRNAs (miR-19b, miR-23b, miR-26a and miR-92a) promotes prostate cell proliferation by regulating PTEN and its downstream signals in vitro.  Methodology/principal findings:   We found that the four microRNAs (miRNAs) could effectively suppress PTEN expression by directly interacting with its 3' UTR in prostate epithelial and cancer cells. Under-expression of the four miRNAs by antisense neutralization up-regulates PTEN expression, while overexpression of the four miRNAs accelerates epithelial and prostate cancer cell proliferation. Furthermore, the expression of the four miRNAs could, singly or jointly, alter the expression of the key components in the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway, including PIK3CA, PIK3CD, PIK3R1 and Akt, along with their downstream signal, cyclin D1.  Conclusions:   These results suggested that the four miRNAs could promote prostate cancer cell proliferation by co-regulating the expression of PTEN, PI3K/Akt pathway and cyclin D1 in vitro.

To that effect, the National Cancer Registry of The Gambia (NCR), a population-based cancer registry (PBCR), was established in 1986 to actively collect data on all cancer diagnosis nation-wide. We extracted 20-years (1990-2009) of data to assess for the first time, the evolution of the most common cancers, also describe and demonstrate the role of the PBCR in a hepatitis B and liver cancer prevention programme in this population.  Methods and findings:   We estimated Age-Standardised Incidence Rates (ASR (W)) of the most common cancers registered during the period by gender. The registration period was divided into four 5-year intervals and incidence rates were estimated for each interval. The most common cancers in males were liver, prostate, lung plus bronchus, non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and stomach, accounting for 60%, 5%, 4%, 5% and 3%, respectively. Similarly, cancers of the cervix uteri, liver, breast and NHL, were the most common in females, accounting for 33%, 24%, 11% and 4% of the female cancers, respectively.  Conclusions:   Cancer incidence has remained relatively stable over time, but as shown elsewhere in sub-Saharan Africa the disease is a threat in The Gambia. The infection related cancers which are mostly preventable (HBV in men and HPV/HIV in women) were the most common. At the moment the data is not enough to detect an effect of hepatitis B vaccination on liver cancer incidence in The Gambia.

We analyzed 110 primary prostate cancer samples, 70 metastatic tumor samples from 11 patients, and 27 xenograft tissues derived from 22 advanced prostate cancer patients using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis with probes targeting the TMPRSS2/ERG, PTEN, and AR gene loci. Heterogeneity of the aberrations detected was evaluated. Genetic patterns were also correlated with transcript levels. Among samples with complete data available, the three-marker FISH panel detected chromosomal abnormalities in 53% of primary prostate cancers and 87% of metastatic (Met) or castration-resistant (CRPC) tumors. The number of markers with abnormal FISH result had a different distribution between the two groups (P<0.001). At the patient level, Met/CRPC tumors are 4.5 times more likely to show abnormalities than primary cancer patients (P<0.05). Heterogeneity among Met/CRPC tumors is mostly inter-patient. Intra-patient heterogeneity is primarily due to differences between the primary prostate tumor and the metastases while multiple metastatic sites show consistent abnormalities. Intra-tumor variability is most prominent with the AR copy number in primary tumors. AR copy number correlated well with the AR mRNA expression (rho = 0.52, P<0.001). Especially among TMPRSS2:ERG fusion-positive CRPC tumors, AR mRNA and ERG mRNA levels are strongly correlated (rho = 0.64, P<0.001). Overall, the three-marker FISH panel may represent a useful tool for risk stratification of prostate cancer patients.""","""['Xiaoyu Qu', 'Grace Randhawa', 'Cynthia Friedman', 'Brenda F Kurland', 'Lena Glaskova', 'Ilsa Coleman', 'Elahe Mostaghel', 'Celestia S Higano', 'Christopher Porter', 'Robert Vessella', 'Peter S Nelson', 'Min Fang']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Characterization of ERG, AR and PTEN gene status in circulating tumor cells from patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'A novel four-color fluorescence in situ hybridization assay for the detection of TMPRSS2 and ERG rearrangements in prostate cancer.', 'Loss of PTEN is associated with aggressive behavior in ERG-positive prostate cancer.', 'Current status of castration resistant prostate cancer basic research.', 'Emerging biological observations in prostate cancer.', 'PTEN Protein Phosphatase Activity Is Not Required for Tumour Suppression in the Mouse Prostate.', 'A narrative review of individualized treatments of genitourinary tumors: is the future brighter with molecular evaluations?', 'Biomarker development for axial spondyloarthritis.', 'Refinement of the androgen response element based on ChIP-Seq in androgen-insensitive and androgen-responsive prostate cancer cell lines.', 'Methylation profiling identified novel differentially methylated markers including OPCML and FLRT2 in prostate cancer.']"""

Mechanisms that dictate nuclear import and, less extensively, nuclear export of PTEN have been described, however the relevance of these processes in disease states, particularly cancer, remain largely unknown. We investigated the impact of acid ceramidase on the nuclear-cytoplasmic trafficking of PTEN. Immunohistochemical analysis of a human prostate tissue microarray revealed that nuclear PTEN was lost in patients whose tumors had elevated acid ceramidase. We found that acid ceramidase promotes a reduction in nuclear PTEN that is dependent upon sphingosine 1-phosphate-mediated activation of Akt. We were further able to show that sphingosine 1-phosphate promotes formation of a complex between Crm1 and PTEN, and that leptomycin B prevents acid ceramidase and sphingosine 1-phosphate mediated loss of nuclear PTEN, suggesting an active exportin-mediated event. To investigate whether the tumor promoting aspects of acid ceramidase in prostate cancer depend upon its ability to export PTEN from the nucleus, we used enforced nuclear expression of PTEN to study docetaxel-induced apoptosis and cell killing, proliferation, and xenoengraftment. Interestingly, while acid ceramidase was able to protect cells expressing wild type PTEN from docetaxel, promote proliferation and xenoengraftment, acid ceramidase had no impact in cells expressing PTEN-NLS. These findings suggest that acid ceramidase, through sphingosine 1-phosphate, promotes nuclear export of PTEN as a means of promoting tumor formation, cell proliferation, and resistance to therapy.""","""['Thomas H Beckham', 'Joseph C Cheng', 'Ping Lu', 'S Tucker Marrison', 'James S Norris', 'Xiang Liu']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['PTEN expression controls cellular response to cetuximab by mediating PI3K/AKT and RAS/RAF/MAPK downstream signaling in KRAS wild-type, hormone refractory prostate cancer cells.', 'PTEN Inhibits Cell Proliferation, Promotes Cell Apoptosis, and Induces Cell Cycle Arrest via Downregulating the PI3K/AKT/hTERT Pathway in Lung Adenocarcinoma A549 Cells.', 'Nuclear-cytoplasmic partitioning of phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) differentially regulates the cell cycle and apoptosis.', 'Interplay Among PI3K/AKT, PTEN/FOXO and AR Signaling in Prostate Cancer.', 'The PTEN/PI3K/AKT signalling pathway in cancer, therapeutic implications.', ""Nuclear PTEN's Functions in Suppressing Tumorigenesis: Implications for Rare Cancers."", 'Cholesterol and Sphingolipid Enriched Lipid Rafts as Therapeutic Targets in Cancer.', 'Multifaceted Regulation of PTEN Subcellular Distributions and Biological Functions.', 'Genetic and pharmacological inhibition of acid ceramidase prevents asymmetric cell division by neosis.', 'Interdiction of Sphingolipid Metabolism Revisited: Focus on Prostate Cancer.']"""

However, using microRNA's differential expression (tumour versus normal) to determine these signatures may lead to inaccurate predictions and low interpretability because of the noisy nature of miRNA expression data. We present a method for the selection of biologically active microRNAs using gene expression data and microRNA-to-gene interaction network. Our method is based on a linear regression with an elastic net regularization. Our simulations show that, with our method, the active miRNAs can be detected with high accuracy and our approach is robust to high levels of noise and missing information. Furthermore, our results on real datasets for glioblastoma and prostate cancer are confirmed by microRNA expression measurements. Our method leads to the selection of potentially functionally important microRNAs. The associations of some of our identified miRNAs with cancer mechanisms are already confirmed in other studies (hypoxia related hsa-mir-210 and apoptosis-related hsa-mir-296-5p).

Experimental design:   Using human prostate cancer xenograft studies in mice, we determined the impact of cabozantinib on tumor growth in soft tissue and bone.

Results:   Cabozantinib inhibited progression of multiple prostate cancer cell lines (Ace-1, C4-2B, and LuCaP 35) in bone metastatic and soft tissue murine models of prostate cancer, except for PC-3 prostate cancer cells in which it inhibited only subcutaneous growth. Cabozantinib directly inhibited prostate cancer cell viability and induced apoptosis in vitro and in vivo and inhibited cell invasion in vitro. Cabozantinib had a dose-dependent biphasic effect on osteoblast activity and inhibitory effect on osteoclast production in vitro that was reflected in vivo.

HOXB13 is involved in PCa progression and is overexpressed in castration-resistant PCa. DNA microarray analysis of LNCaP Pca cells showed that ZnT zinc output transporters were strikingly upregulated among androgen-independent HOXB13 target genes. Furthermore, exogenous HOXB13 caused intracellular zinc concentrations to fall in PCa cells, stimulated NF-κB-mediated signaling by reducing inhibitor of NF-κB alpha (IκBα) and enhanced the nuclear translocation of RelA/p65. Human prostate tumors also exhibited strong inverse correlation between the protein expressions of HOXB13 and IκBα. Consequently, HOXB13 stimulated PCa cell invasion, and this was inhibited by the suppression of ZnT4. In addition, studies in a PC3 orthotopic mouse model of PCa metastasis showed that HOXB13 is a strong metastatic stimulator. Taken together, these results show that HOXB13 promotes PCa invasion and metastasis by decreasing intracellular zinc levels, thus stimulating NF-κB signals, and suggest that HOXB13 acts as a modulator of intracellular zinc levels that promotes the malignant characteristics of PCa.""","""['Y-R Kim', 'I-J Kim', 'T W Kang', 'C Choi', 'K K Kim', 'M S Kim', 'K I Nam', 'C Jung']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['HOXB13-mediated suppression of p21WAF1/CIP1 regulates JNK/c-Jun signaling in prostate cancer cells.', 'Blockade of NF-kappaB activity in human prostate cancer cells is associated with suppression of angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis.', 'HOXB13 regulates the prostate-derived Ets factor: implications for prostate cancer cell invasion.', 'Zinc as an anti-tumor agent in prostate cancer and in other cancers.', 'Advances of Zinc Signaling Studies in Prostate Cancer.', 'A Live Cell Protein Complementation Assay for ORFeome-Wide Probing of Human HOX Interactomes.', 'HOXA5-Mediated Stabilization of IκBα Inhibits the NF-κB Pathway and Suppresses Malignant Transformation of Breast Epithelial Cells.', 'circRNA: A New Biomarker and Therapeutic Target for Esophageal Cancer.', 'miR-20a-5p inhibits proliferation of lung cancer A549 cells by down-regulating HOXB13.', 'N-α-Acetyltransferase 10 inhibits invasion and metastasis of oral squamous cell carcinoma via regulating Pirh2-p53 signalling pathway.']"""

CaP survivors are uniquely positioned to address this problem by drawing upon real-life experiences to share nuanced information and perspectives. While CaP survivors have historically been incorporated into outreach programs, little is known about their impact on psychosocial outcomes and their effectiveness compared to professional health educators. This study addressed these gaps through a quasi-experimental design where African American men attended a CaP screening session conducted by a health educator (HE) or survivor educator (SV). The presentation included prostate cancer statistics, CaP information, and descriptions of CaP screening tests. SV were encouraged to bolster their presentations with personal stories whereas HE maintained fidelity to the curriculum content. All participants completed pre- and post-test questionnaires. Our sample comprised a total of 63 participants (HE group = 32; SV group = 31) with an age range of 40-70 years. Decision self-efficacy increased significantly in the SV group (p = 0.01) whereas perceived screening risks reduced significantly in the HE group (p < 0.001).

Survivor educators were found to have significantly greater appeal (p = 0.03), identification with audience (p = 0.01), and liking (p = 0.03).

Mutations of the BLM gene cause another chromosomal instability clinical syndrome, called Bloom syndrome. Recently, a recurrent truncating mutation of BLM (Q548X) has been associated with a 6-fold increased risk of breast cancer in Russia, Belarus and Ukraine, but its role in prostate cancer etiology and survival has not been investigated yet.  Methods:   To establish whether the Q548X allele of the BLM gene is present in Poland, and whether this allele predisposes to poor prognosis prostate cancer, we genotyped 3337 men with prostate cancer and 2604 controls.  Results:   Q548X was detected in 13 of 3337 (0.4%) men with prostate cancer compared to 15 of 2604 (0.6%) controls (OR=0.7; 95% CI 0.3-1.4). A positive family history of any cancer in a first- or second-degree relative was seen only in 4 of the 13 (30%) mutation positive families, compared to 49% (1485/3001) of the non-carrier families (p=0.3). The mean follow-up was 49months. Survival was similar among carriers of Q548X and non-carriers (HR=1.1; p=0.9).

Limited data exist on postdiagnostic folate/folic acid intake and the risk of prostate cancer progression. We prospectively examined the association between postdiagnostic folate consumption and the risk of prostate cancer recurrence after radical prostatectomy, external beam radiation therapy and brachytherapy.  Materials and methods:   This study was done in 1,153 men treated with radical prostatectomy, external beam radiation therapy and brachytherapy who had clinical stage T1-T2c prostate adenocarcinoma and participated in the CaPSURE Diet and Lifestyle substudy by completing the semiquantitative Food Frequency Questionnaire in 2004 to 2005. We used Cox proportional hazards regression to analyze the association between folate intake and prostate cancer progression.  Results:   Prostate cancer progressed in 101 men (8.76%) during a mean 34-month followup. After multivariate adjustment we observed no evidence of an association of the intake of total folate, dietary folate or dietary folate equivalents with prostate cancer recurrence. On secondary analysis by treatment after radical prostatectomy patients in the lowest decile of dietary folate intake had a 2.6-fold increase in the risk of recurrence (HR 2.56, 95% CI 1.23-5.29, p = 0.01).

(Asteraceae) root decoction is used in folk medicine in Cameroon to treat some ailments including prostate cancer. The aim of this study was to validate the claimed antiprostate cancer activity of Vernonia guineensis Benth. in vivo and to investigate the cytotoxicity of a pentaisovaleryl sucrose isolated from Vernonia guineensis on some cancer cell lines.  Materials and methods:   A crude dichloromethane extract of Vernonia guineensis (VGDE) was used for this study. For in vivo antiprostate cancer efficacy, nude mice (n=16) were injected subcutaneously with prostate cancer PC-3 cells. Upon the formation of the xenograft tumors, the mice were divided into two equal groups with approximately the same mean tumor volume per group. One group was treated with VGDE orally (500 mg/kg) and the other with a vehicle control for 30 days. Body weight and tumor volumes were measured 2× a week and on the 33rd day, the mice were euthanized and tumors harvested and weighed. For the cytotoxicity study, the WST-1 assay was used to determine the activity of pentaisovaleryl sucrose previously isolated from VGDE. The cancer cell lines used in the cytotoxicity study included breast, colon, leukemia, lung, melanoma, ovarian and prostate.  Results:   Prostate cancer (PC-3) xenograft tumors treated with VGDE showed a significant decrease in tumor size (P=0.0295) compared to control. Pentaisovaleryl sucrose also demonstrated cytotoxicity against various cancer cell lines with IC₅₀ values as follows: MDA-MD-231-6.66µM; MCF-7-7.50 µM; HCT116-14.12 µM; A549-5.76 µM; HL60-6.43 µM; A375-8.64 µM; OVCAR3-9.53 µM; Capan1-7.13 µM; Mia-Paca 6.47 µM.  Conclusion:   VGDE does possess in vivo activity against prostate tumor and has potential for development into a natural product for the treatment of prostate cancer. This study thus provides preliminary validation for the folk use of Vernonia guineensis against prostate conditions. Further in vivo studies are however required to confirm these results and to understand the mechanism of action of VGDE and the in vivo efficacy of pentaisovaleryl sucrose.""","""['Ngeh J Toyang', 'Eugene N Ateh', 'Harry Davis', 'Pierre Tane', 'Luc B Sondengam', 'Joseph Bryant', 'Rob Verpoorte']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Ethnopharmacol""","""['In vitro anti-prostate cancer and ex vivo antiangiogenic activity of Vernonia guineensis Benth.

The mechanism of such promotion is believed to involve chronic inflammation that creates a microenvironment which enhances tumor survival. Therefore, blocking CCR5 function with an antagonist may provide a novel treatment of cancers such as prostate cancer. Currently, several CCR5 antagonists are available, but all have been optimized for their inhibitory activity on HIV-1 cellular membrane invasion process rather than inhibition on cytoplasmic signaling pathways. Thus, there is need to develop CCR5 antagonists focusing on blockage of CCR5 downstream signaling and inhibition of CCR5 related prostate cancer proliferation and progression. In this report, a pharmacophore analysis was conducted based on docking studies of several known CCR5 antagonists in a CCR5 homology model. A unique structural skeleton for CCR5 antagonist was constructed and functionalized, resulting in a new series of small molecules to be synthesized and characterized. A combination of CCR5 calcium flux inhibition, anti prostate cancer cell proliferation, basal cytotoxicity, and in vivo animal model studies were applied to screen the newly synthesized compounds.

Several practical problems are described that arise when searching for a proper model among those that already exist. A new model is developed with only two explanatory variables and a simple graphical output.  Methods:   This is a retrospective cohort study based on data collected from December 2006 to June 2011 at the Clinic of Urology of the University Hospital in Olomouc, Czech Republic. The cohort consists of 221 patients who underwent the first repeated biopsy after an initial biopsy with a negative outcome. All patients had prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels between 1.5 and 16.5 ng/mL and a prostate volume not greater than 100mL. A logistic regression model was fitted.  Results:   Of the 221 patients, 29 (13%) were diagnosed with prostate cancer on the repeated biopsy. The final model includes the PSA level and the transitory zone volume as predictors. Its accuracy is 76.4%. The cut-off point of 0.0687 in the predicted positive repeated biopsy outcome assures 95% sensitivity and prevents 42% of unnecessary biopsies.  Conclusions:   The accuracy of the model is comparable to that of more complex models (with more than two predictors) published in the literature. The model includes only two routinely measured variables, and hence it is accessible for a wide range of practitioners.

Methods:   A total of 102 preoperatively potent men underwent laparoscopic or robotic radical prostatectomy; NS was prospectively graded at surgery using a 0-4 scale/neurovascular bundle. Urinary functional outcomes were measured by validated Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite questionnaire at baseline and follow-up time points (1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months) in 99 men who underwent various degrees of NS. Mixed linear regression was used to analyze the effect of NS quality and other clinical factors on urinary outcomes.

Significantly less urinary bother was also noted in these men by 9-12 months postoperatively. Multivariate analysis revealed that bilateral or unilateral excellent NS (at least 1 bundle graded 4/4), increasing time from surgery, young patient age, and lower body mass index positively and significantly affected urinary functional outcomes, including pad use. Men who received excellent unilateral NS recovered urinary function about as well as men who had both neurovascular bundles spared in similar fashion.

Methods:   A beam model was produced using the GATE platform for GEANT4 Monte Carlo dose calculations. Initially validated against static measurements, the model was then integrated with a VMAT delivery emulator, which reads plan files and generates a set of dynamic delivery instructions analogous to the linac control system. Monte Carlo simulations were compared to measurements on dosimetric phantoms for prostate and head and neck VMAT plans. Comparisons were made between calculations using fixed control points, and simulations of continuous motion utilising the emulator. For routine use, the model was incorporated into an automated pre-treatment QA system.  Results:   The model showed better agreement with measurements when incorporating linac motion: mean gamma pass (Γ<1) over 5 prostate plans was 100.0% at 3%/3mm and 97.4% at 2%/2mm when compared to measurement. For the head and neck plans, delivered to the anatomical phantom, gamma passes were 99.4% at 4%/4mm and 94.94% at 3%/3mm. For example simulations within patient CT data, gamma passes were observed which are within our centre's tolerance for pre-treatment QA.  Conclusions:   Through comparison to phantom measurements, it was found that the incorporation of a realistic linac motion improves the accuracy of the model compared to the simulation of fixed control points. The ability to accurately calculate dose as a second check of the planning system, and determine realistic delivery characteristics, may allow for the reduction of machine-based pre-treatment plan QA for VMAT.""","""['Christopher J Boylan', 'Adam H Aitkenhead', 'Carl G Rowbottom', 'Ranald I Mackay']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Radiother Oncol""","""['Feasibility of a GATE Monte Carlo platform in a clinical pretreatment QA system for VMAT treatment plans using TrueBeam with an HD120 multileaf collimator.', 'Phantomless patient-specific TomoTherapy QA via delivery performance monitoring and a secondary Monte Carlo dose calculation.', 'A method to reconstruct and apply 3D primary fluence for treatment delivery verification.', 'Machine QA for the Elekta Unity system: A Report from the Elekta MR-linac consortium.', 'Is it necessary to repeat quality control procedures for head and neck patients?', 'A preclinical radiotherapy dosimetry audit using a realistic 3D printed murine phantom.', 'Novel methodologies for dosimetry audits: Adapting to advanced radiotherapy techniques.', 'Dosimetric accuracy of dynamic couch rotation during volumetric modulated arc therapy (DCR-VMAT) for primary brain tumours.', '3D VMAT Verification Based on Monte Carlo Log File Simulation with Experimental Feedback from Film Dosimetry.']"""

However, not all LNI patients share the same cancer control outcomes.  Objective:   To develop and internally validate novel nomograms predicting cancer-specific mortality (CSM)-free rate in pN1 patients.  Design, setting, and participants:   We evaluated 1107 patients with pN1 PCa treated with radical prostatectomy, pelvic lymph node dissection, and adjuvant therapy at two tertiary care centers between 1988 and 2010.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Univariable and multivariable Cox regression models tested the relationship between CSM and patient clinical and pathologic characteristics, which consisted of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) value, pathologic Gleason score, pathologic tumor stage, status of surgical margins, number of positive lymph nodes, and status of adjuvant therapy. A Cox regression coefficient-based nomogram was developed and internally validated.  Results and limitations:   All 1107 patients received adjuvant hormonal therapy (aHT). Additionally, 35% of patients received adjuvant radiotherapy (aRT). The 10-yr CSM-free rate was 84% in the entire cohort and 87% in patients treated with aRT plus aHT versus 82% in patients treated with aHT alone (p=0.08). At multivariable analyses, PSA value, pathologic Gleason score, pathologic tumor stage, surgical margin status, number of positive lymph nodes, and aRT status were statistically significant predictors of CSM (all p ≤ 0.04). Based on these predictors, nomograms were developed to predict the 10-yr CSM-free rate in the overall patient population and in men with biochemical recurrence. These models showed high discrimination accuracy (79.5-83.3%) and favorable calibration characteristics. These results are limited by their retrospective nature.  Conclusions:   Some patients with pN1 PCa have favorable CSM-free rates at 10 yr.

Participants viewed information on prostate cancer and prostate cancer screening with PSA testing then completed a values clarification task that included information on 4 key attributes: chance of 1) being diagnosed with prostate cancer, 2) dying from prostate cancer, 3) requiring a biopsy as a result of screening, and 4) developing impotence or incontinence as a result of screening. The outcome measures were self reported most important attribute, unlabelled screening test choice, and labelled screening intent, assessed on post-task questionnaires.  Results:   We enrolled 911 participants (US:456; AU:455), mean age was 59.7; 88.0% were white; 36.4% had completed at least a Bachelors' degree; 42.0% reported a PSA test in the past 12 months. Australian men were more likely to be white and to have had recent screening. For both US and Australian men, the most important attribute was the chance of dying from prostate cancer. Unlabelled post-task preference for the PSA screening-like option was greater for Australian (39.1%) compared to US (26.3%) participants (adjusted OR 1.68 (1.28-2.22)). Labelled intent for screening was high for both countries: US:73.7%, AUS:78.0% (p = 0.308).  Conclusions:   There was high intent for PSA screening in both US and Australian men; fewer men in each country chose the PSA-like option on the unlabelled question. Australian men were somewhat more likely to prefer PSA screening. Men in both countries did not view the increased risk of diagnosis as a negative aspect, suggesting more work needs to be done on communicating the concept of overdiagnosis to men facing a PSA screening decision.  Trial registration:   This trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01558583).""","""['Kirsten Howard', 'Alison T Brenner', 'Carmen Lewis', 'Stacey Sheridan', 'Trisha Crutchfield', 'Sarah Hawley', 'Matthew E Nielsen', 'Michael P Pignone']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""BMC Health Serv Res""","""['Comparing 3 techniques for eliciting patient values for decision making about prostate-specific antigen screening: a randomized controlled trial.', ""Men's preferences and trade-offs for prostate cancer screening: a discrete choice experiment."", 'Medical Maximizing-Minimizing Preferences Predict Responses to Information about Prostate-Specific Antigen Screening.', 'Screening for prostate cancer.', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen-Based Screening for Prostate Cancer: Evidence Report and Systematic Review for the US Preventive Services Task Force.', 'Values and preferences of men for undergoing prostate-specific antigen screening for prostate cancer: a systematic review.', ""Cancer-related hospitalisations and 'unknown' stage prostate cancer: a population-based record linkage study."", 'A positive family history as a risk factor for prostate cancer in a population-based study with organised prostate-specific antigen screening: results of the Swiss European Randomised Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC, Aarau).']"""

Clinical data from 102 patients with persistent and refractory haematospermia was retrospectively analysed. Data collected included history, symptoms, as well as ultrasound and MRI of the morphological features of the bilateral seminal vesicles (SV) and ejaculatory duct (ED) areas. Criteria for inclusion were haematospermia symptoms that occurred more than six times, that lasted more than 6 months, and that did not improve after >1 month of conservative treatment. Patients underwent seminal vesiculoscopy with a post-surgery follow-up of 3-48 months [average (18.1 ± 10.3) months]. Of the 102 patients that underwent MRI examination, data from 88 patients (86.3%) showed typical and characteristic changes in the ED area, including the signal intensity changes in 60 (58.8%), SV volume changes in 32(31.4%), the formation of cysts such as prostatic utricular cysts in 27 (26.5%), Müllerian cysts in 4 (3.9%), ED cysts in 5 (4.9%) and a SV cyst in 1(1.0%). The MRI findings were confirmed by seminal vesiculoscopy and all patients received appropriate treatment. In 14 patients (13.7%), no obvious abnormal changes were observed with MRIs, however, these patients were diagnosed and successfully managed using seminal vesiculoscopy. Some degrees of ED obstruction was usually found during surgery. The symptoms of haematospermia disappeared 1-2 months after surgery in all patients. Two patients had a recurrence of haematospermia, underwent the same treatment, and recovered during the follow-up period. The aetiology of the most cases of the refractory haematospermia can be distinguished using the three-dimensional MRI. Typical abnormalities observed on MR images are signal intensity, SV volume changes and cyst formation. MRI has significant etiological diagnostic value and provides reliable information for the subsequent treatment of patients with persistent and refractory haematospermia.""","""['B-J Li', 'C Zhang', 'K Li', 'J Zhang', 'Y Zhang', 'Z-Y Sun', 'H-Y Kang', 'B Zhou', 'F-S Jin', 'K-Q Zhang', 'Y-F Li']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Andrology""","""['Etiology of 305 cases of refractory hematospermia and therapeutic options by emerging endoscopic technology.', 'Seminal vesiculoscopy in the treatment of refractory hemospermia and ejaculatory duct obstruction.', 'Prospective trial comparing transrectal ultrasonography and transurethral seminal vesiculoscopy for persistent hematospermia.', 'Diagnosis and treatment of obstructive seminal vesicle pathology.', 'Diagnosis and treatment of ejaculatory duct cyst: A report of 2 cases and review of the literature.', 'Magnetic resonance imaging compared to ultrasound as the preferred method for diagnosing intractable haematospermia.', 'Transurethral resection of ejaculatory duct combined with seminal vesiculoscopy for management of persistent or recurrent hemospermia in men with ejaculatory duct obstruction.', 'Commentary on ""Transurethral seminal vesiculoscopy for recurrent hemospermia: experience from 419 cases"".', 'Etiology of 305 cases of refractory hematospermia and therapeutic options by emerging endoscopic technology.', 'Transurethral seminal vesiculoscopy for recurrent hemospermia: experience from 419 cases.']"""

Methods:   Twenty-five participants with prostate cancer (PCa) and 27 participants with a variety of benign prostatic conditions as confirmed by a 10-core tissue biopsy were included. Pre- and post-DRE urine samples were prepared for MALDI MS profiling using an automated clean-up procedure. Following mass spectra collection and processing, peak mass and intensity were extracted and subjected to statistical analysis to identify peaks capable of distinguishing between benign and cancer. Logistic regression was used to combine markers to create a sensitive and specific test.  Results:   A peak at m/z 10,760 was identified as β-microseminoprotein (β-MSMB) and found to be statistically lower in urine from PCa participants using the peak's average areas. By combining serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels with MALDI MS-measured β-MSMB levels, optimum threshold values obtained from Receiver Operator characteristics curves gave an increased sensitivity of 96% at a specificity of 26%.  Conclusions:   These results demonstrate that with a simple sample clean-up followed by MALDI MS profiling, significant differences of MSMB abundance were found in post-DRE urine samples. In combination with PSA serum levels, obtained from a classic clinical assay led to high classification accuracy for PCa in the studied sample set.

Despite extensive analysis for the biological functions of ERG in CaP, there is no systematic evaluation of the ERG responsive proteome (ERP). ERP has the potential to define new biomarkers and therapeutic targets for prostate tumors stratified by ERG expression.  Methods:   Global proteome analysis was performed by using ERG (+) and ERG (-) CaP cells isolated by ERG immunohistochemistry defined laser capture microdissection and by using TMPRSS2-ERG positive VCaP cells treated with ERG and control siRNA.  Results:   We identified 1,196 and 2,190 unique proteins stratified by ERG status from prostate tumors and VCaP cells, respectively. Comparative analysis of these two proteomes identified 330 concordantly regulated proteins characterizing enrichment of pathways modulating cytoskeletal and actin reorganization, cell migration, protein biosynthesis, and proteasome and ER-associated protein degradation. ERPs unique for ERG (+) tumors reveal enrichment for cell growth and survival pathways while proteasome and redox function pathways were enriched in ERPs unique for ERG (-) tumors. Meta-analysis of ERPs against CaP gene expression data revealed that Myosin VI and Monoamine oxidase A were positively and negatively correlated to ERG expression, respectively.

Our study aimed to determine the potential impact of the RALP procedure on the detection of known prostate cancer biomarkers, and the subsequent suitability of RALP-derived specimens for prostate cancer biomarker studies.  Methods:   DNA and RNA were extracted from RRP and RALP specimens. Quality assessment was conducted using spectrophotometric analysis and RNA was analyzed for RNA integrity number (RIN) and by real-time reverse-transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) for racemase, hepsin, ERG, TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusions, and the microRNAs miR-26a, miR-26b, miR-141, and miR-221.  Results:   We demonstrate that extraction of derivatives from frozen tissues from RRP and RALP specimens yields samples of equally high quality as assessed by spectrophotometric and RIN analysis. Likewise, expression levels of genes analyzed by qRT-PCR did not differ between RRP and RALP-derived tissues.

The aim of our study was to identify therapeutic targets for CRPC by assessing somatic copy number alterations (SCNAs) by whole-exome sequencing on five CRPC/normal paired formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples, using the SOLiD4 next-generation sequencing (NGS) platform. Data were validated using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) on a PCa progression cohort. PTK2 and YWHAZ amplification, mRNA and protein expression were determined in selected PCa cell lines. Effects of PTK2 inhibition using TAE226 inhibitor and YWHAZ knock-down on cell proliferation and migration were tested in PC3 cells in vitro. In a larger validation cohort, the amplification frequency of YWHAZ was 3% in localized PCa and 48% in CRPC, whereas PTK2 was amplified in 1% of localized PCa and 35% in CRPC. YWHAZ knock-down and PTK2 inhibition significantly affected cell proliferation and migration in the PC3 cells. Our findings suggest that inhibition of YWHAZ and PTK2 could delay the progression of the disease in CRPC patients harbouring amplification of the latter genes.

Methods:   The severity of 13 symptoms proposed to represent ""core"" oncology symptoms was rated by 3106 ambulatory patients with cancer of the breast, prostate, colon/rectum, or lung, regardless of disease stage or phase of care; 2801 patients (90%) repeated the assessment 4 to 5 weeks later.  Results:   At the time of the initial assessment, approximately 33% of the patients reported ≥ 3 symptoms in the moderate-to-severe range; 11 of the 13 symptoms were rated as moderate to severe by at least 10% of all patients and 6 were rated as moderate to severe by at least 20% of those receiving active treatment. Fatigue/tiredness was the most severe symptom, followed by disturbed sleep, pain, dry mouth, and numbness/tingling. More patients with lung cancer and patients receiving active treatment reported moderate to severe symptoms. Percentages of symptomatic patients increased by disease stage, less adequate response to therapy, and declining Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status. The percentages of patients reporting moderate to severe symptoms were stable across both assessments.

Pathological features of biopsy specimens and RP specimens were compared to reveal the incidences of up-grading, up-staging and insignificant cancer.

Up-grading (Gleason score ≥7) and upstaging (≥pT3) were observed in 32 (55.2%) and 6 (10.3%) patients, respectively. Insignificant cancer was observed in 19 (32.8%). Dominant tumors were located in the peripheral zone (PZ) in 34 (58.6%) patients and in the transition zone (TZ) in 24 (41.4%). Multivariate analysis revealed that prostate-specific antigen density ＜0.15 ng/ml/cm3 was a significant independent factor to predict insignificant cancer (odds ratio 6.70, p＝0.036).

As a result, for many years the American Urological Association (AUA) and the American Cancer Society have issued statements recommending screening for PC, resulting in its widespread implementation in the United States. Recently, the United States Preventative Services Task Force gave PC screening a recommendation of D, that is, against PC screening for all men. The AUA countered this recommendation, stating that since the development of PC screening using prostate-specific antigen, a reduction in PC-specific mortality has been seen, and that the risk reduction occurred in a setting in which many of the patients were not aggressively treated for prostate cancer. Active surveillance may be described as a method to potentially delay or obviate the need for treatment in men with clinically insignificant PC or PC thought to be at low risk for progression. Studies have shown no significant difference in outcome or pathology between men with low risk PC who receive treatment at the point of progression and those undergoing immediate treatment. Ongoing studies are evaluating the efficacy and utility of active surveillance for low-risk PC. Interim results of these studies have shown that approximately 30% of patients progress on active surveillance. However, ""progression"" does not necessarily mean treatment failure; rarely do patients develop locally advanced or metastatic disease. Active surveillance has also been shown to be cost-effective when compared with immediate treatment for PC.

Besides surgical resection, treatments for prostate cancer include hormone therapy, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. Advancement of prostate cancer to an androgen-independent state limits the potential of conventional therapeutic approaches. Bortezomib, an FDA-approved proteosomal inhibitor for the treatment of myeloid leukemia, has been shown to have a positive effect on the inhibition of prostate cancer growth. Unfortunately, bortezomib has a very narrow therapeutic window, which can lead to severe side effects. Elastin-like polypeptide (ELP) is a genetically engineered, thermally responsive macromolecular carrier that enables a targeted delivery of the bound molecule because of its soluble property under normal physiologic conditions. In addition, ELP aggregates in response to mild hyperthermia. Using ELP as a carrier, it is possible to improve the pharmacological properties of the therapeutic drug as well as reduce toxicity in normal tissues. In this work, we have investigated the combination treatment of androgen-independent prostate cancer cells with bortezomib and the C-terminal part of the p21(WAF1/CIP1) protein bound to the ELP carrier. We have found that combination treatment with bortezomib and ELP-bound p21(WAF1/CIP1) protein leads to increased cell cycle arrest as well as apoptosis with respect to single treatments.

We performed whole-genome methylation sequencing to investigate the methylation profiles of 13 prostate samples: 5 prostate cancers, 4 matched benign prostate tissues adjacent to tumor, and 4 age-matched organ-donor prostate tissues. Alterations of methylation patterns occurred in prostate cancer and in benign prostate tissues adjacent to tumor, in comparison with age-matched organ-donor prostates. More than 95% alterations of genome methylation occurred in sequences outside CpG islands. Only a small fraction of the methylated CpG islands had any effect on RNA expression. Both intragene and promoter CpG island methylations negatively affected gene expression. However, suppressions of RNA expression did not correlate with levels of CpG island methylation, suggesting that CpG island methylation alone might not be sufficient to shut down gene expression.

Using flow cytometry, we showed that LPA triggers ROS generation within 10min and that the generated ROS can be suppressed by pretreatment with the NADPH oxidase (Nox) inhibitor diphenylene iodonium. In addition, transfection with LPA1 and LPA3 siRNA efficiently blocked LPA-induced ROS production, suggesting that both receptors are involved in this pathway. Using specific inhibitors and siRNA, phospholipase C (PLC) and protein kinase C (PKC) were also suggested to participate in LPA-induced ROS generation.

Objective:   To determine the effectiveness of a year-long randomised controlled trial of exercise training in PCa survivors >5 yr postdiagnosis on physical functioning.  Design, setting, and participants:   Between 2010 and 2011, 100 long-term PCa survivors from Trans-Tasman Radiation Oncology Group 03.04 Randomised Androgen Deprivation and Radiotherapy previously treated with androgen-deprivation therapy and radiation therapy were randomly assigned to 6 mo of supervised exercise followed by 6 mo of a home-based maintenance programme (n=50) or printed educational material about physical activity (n=50) for 12 mo across 13 university-affiliated exercise clinics in Australia and New Zealand.  Intervention:   Supervised resistance and aerobic exercise or printed educational material about physical activity.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The primary end point was a 400-m walk as a measure of cardiovascular fitness. Secondary end points were physical function, patient-reported outcomes, muscle strength, body composition, and biomarkers. Analysis of covariance was used to compare outcomes for groups at 6 and 12 mo adjusted for baseline values.  Results and limitations:   Participants undergoing supervised exercise showed improvement in cardiorespiratory fitness performance at 6 mo (-19 s [p=0.029]) and 12 mo (-13 s [p=0.028]) and better lower-body physical function across the 12-mo period (p<0.01). Supervised exercise also improved self-reported physical functioning at 6 (p=.006) and 12 mo (p=0.002), appendicular skeletal muscle at 6 mo (p=0.019), and objective measures of muscle strength at 6 and 12 mo (p<0.050). Limitations included the restricted number of participants undertaking body composition assessment, no blinding to group assignment for physical functioning measures, and inclusion of well-functioning individuals.  Conclusions:   Supervised exercise training in long-term PCa survivors is more effective than physical activity educational material for increasing cardiorespiratory fitness, physical function, muscle strength, and self-reported physical functioning at 6 mo. Importantly, these benefits were maintained in the long term with a home-based programme with follow-up at 12 mo.

Conclusions:   Intensity modulated RT is associated with a significant reduction in acute G2+ GI/GU toxicity. There is a trend for a clinically meaningful reduction in late G2+ GI toxicity with IMRT.

Patients and methods:   The Cryo-On-Line Database (COLD) Registry was queried to identify patients with cT3 prostate cancer treated with whole-gland cryoablation (366 patients). We assessed biochemical disease-free survival (bDFS) using the Phoenix definition and determined reported rates of urinary incontinence and retention, sexual activity, and rectourethral fistulisation after treatment. Patients were subsequently assessed according to whether they were administered neoadjuvant androgen-deprivation therapy or not (ADT; 115 patients, 31.4%).  Results:   For the entire cohort, the 36- and 60-month bDFS rates were 65.3% and 51.9%, respectively. Patients who received neoadjuvant ADT had statistically nonsignificantly higher 36- and 60-month bDFS rates (68.0% and 55.4%, respectively) than patients who did not receive neoadjuvant ADT (55.3% and 36.9%, respectively). The after treatment urinary incontinence rate was 2.6%; urinary retention rate, 6.0%; sexual activity rate, 30.4%; and rectourethral fistulisation rate, 1.1%.  Conclusions:   Cryoablation for patients with cT3 prostate cancer leads to less favourable bDFS than that after RP or RT for the same group of men. The after treatment rectourethral fistulisation rates for patients with cT3 disease are higher than in those with organ-confined prostate cancer treated with cryoablation; however, urinary dysfunction and sexual activity rates are similar for men with cT3 to those reported from this same registry in men with cT2 disease. The addition of neoadjuvant ADT (though not studied prospectively here) should be strongly considered if a patient with cT3 prostate cancer is to be treated with cryoablation.""","""['John F Ward', 'Christopher J DiBlasio', 'Christopher Williams', 'Robert Given', 'J Stephen Jones']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Primary full-gland prostate cryoablation in older men (> age of 75 years): results from 860 patients tracked with the COLD Registry.', 'Salvage focal prostate cryoablation for locally recurrent prostate cancer after radiotherapy: initial results from the cryo on-line data registry.', 'Radical prostatectomy for clinically advanced (cT3) prostate cancer since the advent of prostate-specific antigen testing: 15-year outcome.', 'Preoperative androgen-deprivation therapy for clinical stage T3 prostate cancer.', 'Radical prostatectomy with neoadjuvant hormone therapy for cT3 prostate cancer.', 'Cryoablation, high-intensity focused ultrasound, irreversible electroporation, and vascular-targeted photodynamic therapy for prostate cancer: a systemic review and meta-analysis.', 'Is cryosurgery a feasible local therapy for bone metastatic prostate cancer?']"""

Results:   Total, occupational, sports and household PA levels were significantly decreased at 6 weeks after RP, but recovered quickly to approximately baseline levels from that time. Predictive factors for decreased PA levels at 6 weeks after RP were a younger age (total PA level), being unskilled/semi-skilled (occupational PA level) and being unemployed/retired (household PA level).

Patients and methods:   Patients planning prostate brachytherapy at one of three institutions were enrolled in a prospective cohort study. Patients were surveyed using a validated instrument to assess treatment-related toxicity before treatment and at pre-specified intervals. Unexpectedly, urinary PROs were worse in one of two standard brachytherapy technique control populations (US-BT1 and US-BT2 ). Therefore, we collaboratively reviewed treatment procedures, identified a discrepancy in technique, made a corrective modification, and evaluated the change.  Results:   The patient groups were demographically and clinically similar. In the first preliminary analysis, US-BT2 patients reported significantly more short-term post-treatment urinary symptoms than US-BT1 patients. The study's treating physicians reviewed the US-BT1 and US-BT2 treatment protocols and found that they differed in whether they used an indwelling urinary catheter. After adopting the US-BT1 approach, short-term urinary morbidity in US-BT2 patients decreased significantly. Brachytherapy procedures were otherwise unchanged.  Conclusion:   Many procedures in cancer treatments are not evaluated, resulting in practice variation and suboptimal outcomes. Patients, the primary medical consumers, provide little direct input in evaluations of their care. We used PROs, a sensitive and valid measure of treatment-related toxicity, for quality assessment and quality improvement (QA/QI) of prostate brachytherapy.

We use this model to predict candidate genes from two gene-disease association data sets and show that our model outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. Finally, we demonstrate the practical utility of our method by successfully recovering well characterized gene-disease associations hidden in our training data.""","""['Cheng H Lee', 'Oluwasanmi Koyejo', 'Joydeep Ghosh']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Annu Int Conf IEEE Eng Med Biol Soc""","""['Disease gene prioritization by integrating tissue-specific molecular networks using a robust multi-network model.', 'A new optical density granulometry-based descriptor for the classification of prostate histological images using shallow and deep Gaussian processes.', 'WBNPMD: weighted bipartite network projection for microRNA-disease association prediction.', 'Gene2DisCo: Gene to disease using disease commonalities.', 'Overview and Evaluation of Recent Methods for Statistical Inference of Gene Regulatory Networks from Time Series Data.']"""

Freehand SPECT and freehand PET provide intra-operative functional imaging techniques that can be complemented with pre- and intra-operative MR imaging to allow for better planning, navigation and guidance. In this paper we propose a method to enable navigation based on pre- or intra-operatively acquired MR images. A fully MR compatible phantom and a dedicated MR compatible optical tracking target with MR markers is built for this study. PET/MR, SPECT/CT and freehand SPECT scans of the phantom are performed. Registration is done using point based registration of the known marker and target geometries and a ground truth is obtained from a SPECT/CT and an MR image that are directly registered. The RMS errors was 0.31 mm for the ground truth and 3.29 mm when using segmentation of the MR markers and their spatial relationship with the optical tracking spheres of the dedicated target. Thus, the freehand SPECT can be registered easily by this approach without the need of any additional CT scans and therefore without any additional radiation dose for the patient. This enables intra-operative fusion of the pre- or intra-operatively acquired MR data, which could provide valuable additional information for intra-operative applications such as guidance based on accurate anatomy or verifying exact tumor location in combination with detailed morphological patient data.""","""['Philipp Matthies', 'Asli Okur', 'Thomas Wendler', 'Nassir Navab', 'Michael Friebe']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Annu Int Conf IEEE Eng Med Biol Soc""","""['Clinical Usefulness of a Novel Freehand 3D Imaging Device for Radio-Guided Intraoperative Sentinel Lymph Node Detection in Malignant Melanoma.', 'Navigation of Fluorescence Cameras during Soft Tissue Surgery-Is it Possible to Use a Single Navigation Setup for Various Open and Laparoscopic Urological Surgery Applications?', 'Navigation of a robot-integrated fluorescence laparoscope in preoperative SPECT/CT and intraoperative freehand SPECT imaging data: a phantom study.', 'Advances in 4D medical imaging and 4D radiation therapy.', 'Contribution of SPECT/CT imaging to radioguided sentinel lymph node biopsy in breast cancer, melanoma, and other solid cancers: from ""open and see"" to ""see and open"".', 'In-room ultrasound fusion combined with fully compatible 3D-printed holding arm - rethinking interventional MRI.', 'Hybrid intraoperative imaging techniques in radioguided surgery: present clinical applications and future outlook.', 'Fusion of Freehand SPECT and Ultrasound to Perform Ultrasound-Guided Fine-Needle Aspiration Cytology of Sentinel Nodes in Head and Neck Cancer.']"""

Angiogenesis imaging is a promising option for detection and localization of prostate cancer. It can be imaged by dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI, assessing microvascular permeability as an indicator for angiogenesis. However, information on microvascular architecture changes associated with angiogenesis is not available. This paper presents a new model enabling the combined assessment of microvascular permeability and architecture. After the intravenous injection of a gadolinium-chelate bolus, time-concentration curves (TCCs) are measured by DCE-MRI at each voxel. According to the convective dispersion equation, the microvascular architecture is reflected in the dispersion coefficient. A solution of this equation is therefore proposed to represent the intravascular blood plasma compartment in the Tofts model. Fitting the resulting model to TCCs measured at each voxel leads to the simultaneous generation of a dispersion and a permeability map. Measurement of an arterial input function is no longer required. Preliminary validation was performed by spatial comparison with the histological results in seven patients referred for radical prostatectomy. Cancer localization by the obtained dispersion maps provided an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve equal to 0.91. None of the standard DCE-MRI parametric maps could outperform this result, motivating towards an extended validation of the method, also aimed at investigating other forms of cancer with pronounced angiogenic development.""","""['M Mischi', 'T Saidov', 'K Kompatsiari', 'M R W Engelbrecht', 'M Breeuwer', 'H Wijkstra']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Annu Int Conf IEEE Eng Med Biol Soc""","""['Magnetic resonance dispersion imaging for localization of angiogenesis and cancer growth.', 'Closed-form solution of the convolution integral in the magnetic resonance dispersion model for quantitative assessment of angiogenesis.', 'Modified MR dispersion imaging in prostate dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI.', 'Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging in the evaluation of the prostate.', 'Dynamic contrast enhanced MRI in prostate cancer.', 'Multiparametric MRI for localized prostate cancer: lesion detection and staging.']"""

These gene fusions lead to prostate-specific and androgen-induced ETS expression and are associated with aggressive lesions, poor prognosis, and early-onset prostate cancer. In this study, we showed that an enhancer at 13 kb upstream of the TMPRSS2 transcription start site is crucial for the androgen regulation of the TMPRSS2 gene when tested in bacterial artificial chromosomal vectors. Within this enhancer, we identified the exact androgen receptor binding sequence. This newly identified androgen response element is situated next to two binding sites for the pioneer factor GATA2, which were identified by DNase I footprinting. Both the androgen response element and the GATA-2 binding sites are involved in the enhancer activity. Importantly, a single nucleotide polymorphism (rs8134378) within this androgen response element reduces binding and transactivation by the androgen receptor. The presence of this SNP might have implications on the expression and/or formation levels of TMPRSS2 fusions, because both have been shown to be influenced by androgens.""","""['Liesbeth Clinckemalie', 'Lien Spans', 'Vanessa Dubois', 'Michaël Laurent', 'Christine Helsen', 'Steven Joniau', 'Frank Claessens']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Mol Endocrinol""","""['Androgen specificity of a response unit upstream of the human secretory component gene is mediated by differential receptor binding to an essential androgen response element.', 'Dynamic nucleosome-depleted regions at androgen receptor enhancers in the absence of ligand in prostate cancer cells.', 'Regulation of androgen-responsive transcription by the chromatin remodeling factor CHD8.', 'An androgen response element in a far upstream enhancer region is essential for high, androgen-regulated activity of the prostate-specific antigen promoter.', 'The progress of TMPRSS2-ETS gene fusions and their mechanism in prostate cancer.', 'Trapa bispinosa Roxb.

Methods:   Immunostaining with a FAS antibody was performed on paraffin-embedded prostate biopsy cores with GS 5-6 obtained from 80 patients who subsequently underwent RP. The correlations between FAS expression and clinicopathological parameters, upgrading group, and clinicopathological parameters including FAS expression were analyzed. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify a significant set of independent predictors for upgrading GS.  Results:   A total of 46 patients (57.5%) with biopsy GS 5-6 were upgraded to GS ≥7 at RP. FAS expression was significantly associated with clinical T stage (P = 0.0232) and positive core rate (P = 0.0245).

It has been hypothesized that reduced treatment intensity combined with increased treatment related toxicity could be the explanation. The objective was to analyze chemotherapy intensity, treatment related toxicity and survival in patients aged ≥40 years treated with standard chemotherapy for GCC compared with a younger control group that received similar treatment during the same period.  Methods:   From 1984 to 2011, 135 patients aged ≥40 years with disseminated GCC treated with bleomycin, etoposide and cisplatin (BEP). A control-group of 135 patients aged 18-35 years was randomly selected matched on year of BEP treatment. Cumulated doses of BEP as well as bone marrow toxicity, renal- and lung functions were recorded before, during and after termination of treatment. All patients were followed until death or October 1, 2011.  Results:   The cumulated doses of BEP were comparable between the two groups, however, more patients aged ≥40 years were reduced in bleomycin doses based on a decrease in carbon monoxide diffusion capacity corrected for haemoglobin (P = 0.03). No differences between the two groups were found regarding bone marrow toxicity or mean percentage changes in lung- or renal function. Patients aged ≥40 year had increased cancer specific mortality, HR = 4.8 (P = 0.005). In particular patients with disease progression after first line chemotherapy had increased mortality (P = 0.015). Moreover, the 5-year overall survival for patients aged ≥40 years was 82.5% compared to the expected 5-year survival of the background population of 96.3% (P <0.001).  Conclusions:   Treatment related toxicity could not explain the increased cancer specific mortality in patients aged ≥40 years compared to a younger control-group, and while there were no differences in the administrated doses of cisplatin/etoposide, a decreased number of bleomycin doses were administered in the older patients. Apart from this, the inferior prognosis could be related to tumour biology, increased co-morbidity, or more severe toxicity in relation to second line treatment.""","""['Frederik B Thomsen', 'Mikkel Bandak', 'Maria F Thomsen', 'Jakob Lauritsen', 'Ib J Christensen', 'Gedske Daugaard']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Cancer""","""['Prognostic Factors and Treatment Results After Bleomycin, Etoposide, and Cisplatin in Germ Cell Cancer: A Population-based Study.', 'Paclitaxel+BEP (T-BEP) regimen as induction chemotherapy in poor prognosis patients with nonseminomatous germ cell tumors: a phase II study.', 'Phase III randomized trial of conventional-dose chemotherapy with or without high-dose chemotherapy and autologous hematopoietic stem-cell rescue as first-line treatment for patients with poor-prognosis metastatic germ cell tumors.', 'Management of good risk germ-cell tumours.', 'Current status of chemotherapy in risk-adapted management for metastatic testicular germ cell cancer.', 'Fertility and prognosis assessment between bleomycin/etoposide/cisplatin and paclitaxel/carboplatin chemotherapy regimens in the conservative treatment of malignant ovarian germ cell tumors: a multicenter and retrospective study.', 'Testicular cancer survivorship: Long-term toxicity and management.', 'Testicular germ cell tumors: a clinicopathological and immunohistochemical analysis of 145 cases.', 'Administration of high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell support in patients 40 years of age or older with advanced germ cell tumours: a retrospective study from the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation database.', 'Safety and efficacy of bleomycin/pingyangmycin-containing chemotherapy regimens for malignant germ cell tumor patients in the female genital system.']"""

The TP-fed gerbils were then provided either a single, oral, cottonseed oil (CO) vehicle dose and tissues were collected at 6 h or they were provided unlabeled PE or LYC in CO and tissues were evaluated at 6, 12, or 24 h. In vehicle-dosed, TP-fed gerbils, LYC was the major carotenoid (≥ 55% carotenoids) in liver, spleen, testes, and the prostate-seminal vesicle complex, whereas PE was the major serum and adipose carotenoid (≥ 37% total carotenoid) and phytofluene was the major carotenoid (≥ 38%) in adrenals and lungs. PE dosing increased hepatic, splenic, and serum PE concentrations compared with vehicle dosing (P < 0.05) from 6 to 24 h, whereas LYC dosing increased only serum LYC at 6 and 12 h (P < 0.05) compared with vehicle dosing. This suggested PE was more bioavailable and cleared more slowly than LYC. To precisely track absorptive and distributive differences, (14)C-PE or (14)C-LYC (n = 2/group) was provided to TP-fed gerbils. Bioavailability assessed by carcass (14)C-content was 23% for PE and 8% for LYC. Nearly every extra-hepatic tissue accumulated greater dose radioactivity after (14)C-PE than (14)C-LYC dosing.

Accurate up-to-date PSA test incidence rates are, however, lacking.  Objective:   To investigate the PSA test incidence rates in general practices over the past 10 years and to study which factors are associated with more frequent test use.  Methods:   We performed a retrospective cohort study using the routine health care database of the Julius General Practitioners Network from 2002 to 2011, of which data were available from more than 65 000 male patients. We calculated the annual incidence of PSA testing rates per 1000 person-years. Co-morbidities were analysed by means of International Classification of Primary Care codes. Relative risks (RRs) of having a PSA test were estimated as the ratio of observed rates of co-morbidities in men who underwent the test compared with a control group, and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated.  Results:   From 2002 to 2011, the overall incidence rate of PSA testing in men ≥45 years increased almost 4-fold, from 15.5 to 54.3 per 1000 person-years.

This pharmacologic profile of tapentadol makes it a suitable drug of choice in nociceptive and neuropathic pain control.  Case report:   This clinical report pressents a 65year old man with poorly differentiated prostate cancer - Gleason score 8 (4 + 4) with metastatic bone disease. Besides the initial application of bisphosphonates, the patient had been treated with androgen deprivation therapy (cyproterone acetate + leuprolide acetate) for the period of 18 months. This therapy was terminated due to an increase of PSA levels. Subsequently, the patient underwent palliative docetaxelbased chemotherapy. There were eight cycles applied with positive clinical and laboratory effect. However, the further application was limited by the averse effects, namely the peripheral neuropathy manifested by pain in arms and legs. The peripheral neuropathy had progressive tendency even after the end of chemotherapy, and supportive treatment with gabapentin and amitryptiline failed to succeed. Four months after zoledronic acid monotherapy, the patient was started on tapentadol in 50-mg dose b.i.d., consequently escalated to 100 mg b.i.d. (to this point, 25 µg of transdermal fentanyl were used for pain management). Significant relief from neuropathic discomfort was observed three weeks from the onset of tapentadol therapy.

Patients and methods:   Eligibility criteria for AS included clinical stage ≤ T2a and Gleason score ≤6, ≤3 cores positive, maximum single core involvement <50%, and total tumour volume ≤5% on diagnostic biopsy. All men received 12-core confirmation biopsy at ≤6 months. AS 'failure' on confirmatory biopsy was defined as failure to meet one or more eligibility criteria. Risk of AS failure was compared in men with and without PNI.  Results:   For the 165 men comprising the study population, the mean (sd) age was 66.9 (6.5) years and the median (interquartile, IQR) PSA level of men at study entry was 4.4 (3.2-6.0) ng/mL. The median (IQR) follow-up was 5.5 (1.1-9.9) months. In all, 8.5% (14/165 men) had PNI on diagnostic biopsy. Compared with those without PNI, men with PNI tended to have more cores involved with cancer, at a mean (sd) of 2.0 (0.7) vs 1.6 (0.8) cores (P = 0.08) but did not have significantly a greater mean (sd) total tumour length on diagnostic biopsy, at 3.0 (2.1) vs 2.3 (3.6) mm (P = 0.27). Men with PNI on diagnostic biopsy were significantly more likely to meet criteria for disease progression on confirmatory biopsy (57% [8/14] vs 21% [32/151]; P = 0.006). PNI remained a significant predictor for AS failure after adjustment for number of positive cores, maximum percentage core involvement, and total tumour length (odds ratio 4.4, 95% confidence interval 1.4-14.2).  Conclusions:   PNI on diagnostic biopsy is associated with disease progression on confirmatory biopsy.

In prostate cancer, H2A.Z and its acetylated form are implicated in oncogenes' upregulation. SIRT1, which may act either as tumor suppressor or oncogene, reduces H2A.Z levels in cardiomyocytes, via proteasome-mediated degradation, and this mechanism might be impaired in prostate cancer cells due to sirtuin 1 downregulation. Thus, we aimed to characterize the mechanisms underlying H2A.Z and SIRT1 deregulation in prostate carcinogenesis and how they interact. We found that H2AFZ and SIRT1 were up- and downregulated, respectively, at transcript level in primary prostate cancer and high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia compared to normal prostatic tissues. Induced SIRT1 overexpression in prostate cancer cell lines resulted in almost complete absence of H2A.Z. Inhibition of mTOR had a modest effect on H2A.Z levels, but proteasome inhibition prevented the marked reduction of H2A.Z due to sirtuin 1 overexpression. Prostate cancer cells exposed to epigenetic modifying drugs trichostatin A, alone or combined with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, increased H2AFZ transcript, although with a concomitant decrease in protein levels. Conversely, SIRT1 transcript and protein levels increased after exposure. ChIP revealed an increase of activation marks within the TSS region for both genes. Remarkably, inhibition of sirtuin 1 with nicotinamide, increased H2A.Z levels, whereas activation of sirtuin 1 by resveratrol led to an abrupt decrease in H2A.Z. Finally, protein-ligation assay showed that exposure to epigenetic modifying drugs fostered the interaction between sirtuin 1 and H2A.Z. We concluded that sirtuin 1 and H2A.Z deregulation in prostate cancer are reciprocally related. Epigenetic mechanisms, mostly histone post-translational modifications, are likely involved and impair sirtuin 1-mediated downregulation of H2A.Z via proteasome-mediated degradation. Epigenetic modifying drugs in conjunction with enzymatic modulators are able to restore the normal functions of sirtuin 1 and might constitute relevant tools for targeted therapy of prostate cancer patients.""","""['Tiago Baptista', 'Inês Graça', 'Elsa J Sousa', 'Ana I Oliveira', 'Natália R Costa', 'Pedro Costa-Pinheiro', 'Francisco Amado', 'Rui Henrique', 'Carmen Jerónimo']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['Acetylation of H2A.Z is a key epigenetic modification associated with gene deregulation and epigenetic remodeling in cancer.', 'Epigenetic regulation of MDR1 gene through post-translational histone modifications in prostate cancer.', 'Histone H2A.Z prepares the prostate specific antigen (PSA) gene for androgen receptor-mediated transcription and is upregulated in a model of prostate cancer progression.', 'Histone H2A.Z deregulation in prostate cancer.

Methods:   A retrospective analysis was performed of 1450 subjects for whom smoking status was available from preoperative notes. Analysis of baseline characteristics by smoking status was performed using the chi-square and rank sum tests. The association between smoking status and time to the event was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier plots, the log-rank test, and Cox and competing risk models.  Results:   A total of 549 men (33%) men were active smokers and 1121 (67%) were nonsmokers at the time of surgery. Current smokers were younger and had a lower body mass index, higher prostate-specific antigen level, and more extracapsular extension and seminal vesicle invasion (all P<.05). A total of 509 patients, 26 patients, 30 patients, 18 patients, and 217 patients, respectively, experienced BCR, metastasis, CRPC, prostate cancer-related death, and any-cause death over a median follow-up of 62 months, 75 months, 61 months, 78 months, and 78 months, respectively. After adjusting for preoperative features, active smoking was found to be associated with an increased risk of BCR (hazards ratio [HR], 1.25; P=.024), metastasis (HR, 2.64; P=.026), CRPC (HR, 2.62; P=.021), and overall mortality (HR, 2.14; P<.001).

Conclusions:   Among patients undergoing radical prostatectomy, cigarette smoking was associated with an increased risk of metastasis.

Methods:   A retrospective study was performed involving 31 prostate cancer patients with bone metastasis treated with Sr-89. Using PSA as an evaluation criterion of cancer control, patients were divided into PSA responder and non-responder groups, and the survival rates of these groups were compared.

As secondary investigation items, age, PSA (ng/ml), pain site, extent of the disease, the presence or absence of castration-resistant prostatic cancer (CRPC), the presence or absence of a past medical history of treatment with docetaxel in CRPC cases, Gleason Score, hemoglobin (g/dl), platelet (Plt) (/μl), serum carboxyterminal telopeptide of type I collagen (ng/ml), and bone-alkaline phosphatase (BAP) (U/l) were investigated.  Results:   Longer survival was expected for the PSA responder group than for the PSA non-responder group, and whether the spine was the pain site and the presence or absence of CRPC were useful as predictors of this. Plt was suggested to be a useful indicator. Furthermore, the survival time was significantly longer in the pain responder group than in the pain non-responder group, and whether the pain site was present in the spine was considered to be a predictor; however, no significant difference was noted in any of the items assumed to be biomarkers.

Results:   One hundred and forty-one out of 258 (55%) sectors of analysis showed 'any cancer' and 77/258 (30%) had the target histological condition for the purpose of deriving the primary outcome. Median (with range) for age, PSA, gland volume and number of biopsies taken were 62 years (41-82), 5.8 ng ml(-1) (1.2-20), 40 ml (16-137) and 41 cores (20-93), respectively. For the primary outcome sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values and area under the receiver-operating curve (with 95% confidence intervals) were 94% (88-99%), 23% (17-29%), 34% (28-40%), 89% (79-98%) and 0.72 (0.65-0.79), respectively.

The Patient-Oriented Prostate Utility Scale (PORPUS-U) measures utility (0=dead and 1=full health). Utility is a preference-based approach to measure health-related quality of life, required for decision analyses and cost-effectiveness analyses. We developed a function to estimate PORPUS-U utilities from PCI scores.  Methods:   The development data set included 676 community-dwelling prostate cancer (PC) survivors who completed the PCI and PORPUS-U by mail. We fit three linear regression models: one used original PORPUS-U scores and two used log-transformed PORPUS-U scores, one with a hierarchy constraint and one without. The model selection was performed using stepwise selection and fivefold cross validation. The validation data included 248 PC outpatients with three assessments on the PCI and PORPUS-U. Scores were retransformed for validation, with Duan's smearing estimator applied to correct potential bias. The predictive ability of the models was assessed with R(2), root mean square error (RMSE) and by comparing predicted and observed utilities.  Results:   The best-fitting model used the log-transformed PORPUS-U with no hierarchy constraint. The R(2) was 0.72. The RMSE ranged from 0.040 to 0.061 for the three validation data sets. Differences between predicted and observed utilities ranged from 0.000 to 0.006 but predicted utilities overestimated the lowest 5% of observed PORPUS-U scores and underestimated the highest observed scores.  Conclusions:   Our algorithm can calculate PORPUS-U utility scores from PCI scores, thus supplementing descriptive quality of life measures with utility scores in PC patients. Utilities derived from mapping algorithms are useful for assigning utility to groups of patients but are less accurate at predicting utility of individual patients. We are exploring statistical methods to improve the mapping of utilities from descriptive instruments.""","""['K E Bremner', 'N Mitsakakis', 'L Wilson', 'M D Krahn']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['A reference set of health utilities for long-term survivors of prostate cancer: population-based data from Ontario, Canada.', 'Development and validation of a utility weighting function for the patient-oriented prostate utility scale (PORPUS).', 'Patient and community preferences for outcomes in prostate cancer: implications for clinical policy.', 'Health-related quality of life, satisfaction, and economic outcome measures in studies of prostate cancer screening and treatment, 1990-2000.', 'A review and meta-analysis of prostate cancer utilities.', 'Mapping expanded prostate cancer index composite to EQ5D utilities to inform economic evaluations in prostate cancer: Secondary analysis of NRG/RTOG 0415.', 'Combined cancer patient-reported symptom and health utility tool for routine clinical implementation: a real-world comparison of the ESAS and EQ-5D in multiple cancer sites.', 'A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Prostate Cancer Utility Values of Patients and Partners Between 2007 and 2016.']"""

Our early studies found AR knock-out mice (with few androgens and deleted AR) failed to develop BCa, yet 50% of castrated mice (with few androgens and existing AR) still developed BCa in an N-butyl-N-(4-hydroxybutyl)nitrosamine (BBN) carcinogen-induced BCa mouse model, suggesting the existing AR in BCa of castrated mice may still play important roles in promoting BCa development at the castration level of androgens. The mechanism underlying this and/or which factors potentiate AR function at the castration level of androgen remains unclear. Epidermal growth factor (EGF), a key player in BCa progression, has been demonstrated to be able to potentiate AR transactivation in prostate cancer. In the present study, we found that EGF could increase BCa cell growth, migration and invasion in the presence of AR under the low amount of androgen and EGF was able to potentiate AR transactivation through EGFR by activating PI3K/AKT and MAPK pathway at castration androgen level. The increased suppression effects by EGFR inhibitor of PD168393 on AR function after addition of anti-androgen, Casodex, further suggested AR might play a key role in the effects of EGF on BCa progression and metastasis. Collectively, our results indicate that EGF may be able to potentiate AR transactivation that leads to enhancing BCa progression, which may help us to develop a better therapeutic approach to treat BCa via targeting both EGF and AR signaling.""","""['Teng-Fu Hsieh', 'Chi-Cheng Chen', 'Wen-Lung Ma', 'Wei-Min Chuang', 'Xiao-Fan Hung', 'Yi-Ru Tsai', 'Meng-Hsueh Amanda Lin', 'Qiaoxia Zhang', 'Caixia Zhang', 'Chawnshang Chang', 'Chih-Rong Shyr']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Oncol Rep""","""['Promotion of bladder cancer development and progression by androgen receptor signals.', 'Dihydrotestosterone interacts with EGFR/MAPK signalling and modulates EGFR levels in androgen receptor-positive LNCaP prostate cancer cells.', 'Tumor microenvironment B cells increase bladder cancer metastasis via modulation of the IL-8/androgen receptor (AR)/MMPs signals.', 'The role of the androgen receptor in the development and progression of bladder cancer.', 'Molecular biology of castration-resistant prostate cancer: basis for the novel therapeutic targets.', 'The androgen receptor in bladder cancer.', 'EGF-induced nuclear translocation of SHCBP1 promotes bladder cancer progression through inhibiting RACGAP1-mediated RAC1 inactivation.', 'Targeting androgen receptor (AR) with antiandrogen Enzalutamide increases prostate cancer cell invasion yet decreases bladder cancer cell invasion via differentially altering the AR/circRNA-ARC1/miR-125b-2-3p or miR-4736/PPARγ/MMP-9 signals.', 'Understanding the biology of urothelial cancer metastasis.', 'Potential therapeutic effects of N-butylidenephthalide from Radix Angelica Sinensis (Danggui) in human bladder cancer cells.']"""

Patients and methods:   We reviewed patients with mCRPC treated with docetaxel at Princess Margaret Cancer Centre. Primary outcomes were overall survival and PSA response rate. Secondary outcomes were reasons for discontinuation and febrile neutropenia. Outcomes were compared for men treated in routine practice and in clinical trials, and with data from the TAX 327 study.  Results:   From 2001 to 2011, 438 men were treated, of whom 357 received 3-weekly docetaxel as first-line chemotherapy: 314 in routine practice and 43 in clinical trials.

This study extends these findings to BXPC-3 (mutated p53) and HPAC (wild-type p53) pancreatic cancer cells and explores the reversibility of these effects. Cells were exposed to L-methionine (5 mg/ml) for 7 days or for 3 days, followed by 4 days of culture without L-methionine (recovery). Cell proliferation, apoptosis, and cell cycle effects were assessed by flow cytometry after staining for Ki-67 or annexin V/propidium iodide. Cell proliferation was reduced by 31-35% after 7 days of methionine exposure; the effect persisted in BXPC-3 and HPAC cells after 4 days of recovery. Methionine increased apoptosis by 40-75% in HPAC cells, but not in BXPC-3 cells. Continuous exposure to methionine caused accumulation of BXPC-3 cells in the S phase and HPAC cells in both the G0/G1 and S phases; however, after 4 days of recovery, these effects disappeared. In conclusion, L-methionine inhibits proliferation and interferes with the cell cycle of BXPC-3 and HPAC pancreatic cancer cells; the effects on apoptosis remarkably persisted after methionine withdrawal. Apoptosis was induced only in BXPC-3 cells. Some of the differences in the effects of methionine between cell lines may be related to disparate p53 status.

Methods and materials:   Data for the first 2000 LDR-PB monotherapy implants were extracted from a database containing patient, tumor, dosimetric, and outcomes information. By National Comprehensive Cancer Network criteria, half (n = 1006) had low-risk disease and half (n = 990) had intermediate-risk disease (four had high-risk disease). Most patients (58.4%) and 75.3% of intermediate-risk patients received 3 months neoadjuvant and 3 months concomitant androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted using recognized prognostic factors and the whole prostate dose metrics D90 (the minimum dose received by 90% of the postimplant CT-based prostate volume) and V100 (the percent of the postimplant CT-based prostate volume that received at least 100% of the prescription dose).  Results:   The median followup is 5 years (maximum, 12.5 years); the 5-, 7-, and 10-year actuarial DFS estimates are 96.0%, 94.4%, and 93.0%, respectively. Of the recognized prognostic factors, only pretreatment prostate-specific antigen (p = 0.012) and Gleason sum (p = 0.010) were predictive of DFS. When analyzed as continuous variables, dose metrics were not predictive of DFS. However, most nonsignificant trends favored higher doses, and D90 values <130 Gy were predictive of an increased risk of recurrence in the non-ADT subset (N = 833; log rank, p = 0.018).  Conclusions:   Although D90 values of <130 Gy were predictive of an increased risk of recurrence in the non-ADT subset, neither D90 nor V100, when used as continuous variables, was predictive of DFS when applied to the entire cohort or in the subset analysis.

Cancer stem cells (CSCs) play major roles in cancer initiation, progression, and drug resistance. Rottlerin (Rott) is an active molecule isolated from Mallotus philippinensis, a medicinal plant used in Ayurvedic Medicine for anti-allergic and anti-helminthic treatments, demonstrates anticancer activities. However, the molecular mechanisms by which it induces autophagy in prostate CSCs have not been examined. The main objective of the paper was to examine the molecular mechanisms by which Rott induces autophagy in prostate CSCs. Autophagy was measured by the lipid modification of light chain-3 (LC3) and the formation of autophagosomes. Apoptosis was measured by flow cytometer analysis. The Western blot analysis was used to examine the effects of Rott on the expression of PI3K, phosphorylation of Akt, phosphorylation of mTOR, and phosphorylation of AMPK in pros CSCs. RNAi technology was used to inhibit the expression of Beclin-1 and ATG-7. Rott induced the lipid modification of light chain-3 (LC3) and the formation of autophagosomes after 24h of Rott treatment in prostate CSCs. Rott-treated prostate CSCs induced transition from LC3-I to LC3-II, a hall mark of autophagy. Rott also induced the expression of Atg5, Atg7, Atg12 and Beclin-1 proteins during autophagy. The knock-down of Atg7 and Beclin-1 blocked Rott-induced autophagy. Furthermore, Rott induced AMPK phosphorylation was blocked by 3-MA, Baf and CHX. In addition, inhibition of AMPK expression by shRNA blocked Rott induced autophagy. In conclusion, a better understanding of the biology of autophagy and the pharmacology of autophagy modulators has the potential for facilitating the development of autophagy-based therapeutic interventions for prostate cancer.""","""['Dhruv Kumar', 'Sharmila Shankar', 'Rakesh K Srivastava']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Cancer Lett""","""['Rottlerin-induced autophagy leads to the apoptosis in breast cancer stem cells: molecular mechanisms.', 'Rottlerin induces autophagy which leads to apoptotic cell death through inhibition of PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway in human pancreatic cancer stem cells.', 'Benzyl isothiocyanate induces protective autophagy in human prostate cancer cells via inhibition of mTOR signaling.', 'Targeting the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Natural products targeting autophagy via the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway as anticancer agents.', 'Crosstalk between autophagy and CSCs: molecular mechanisms and translational implications.', 'Ethyl Acetate Extract of Halymenia durvillei Induced Apoptosis, Autophagy, and Cell Cycle Arrest in Colorectal Cancer Cells.', 'State-of-the-art therapeutic strategies for targeting cancer stem cells in prostate cancer.', 'Identification of Potential Antiviral Hops Compounds against Chikungunya Virus.', 'Apelin-13 prevents the effects of oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion on bEnd.3 cells by inhibiting AKT-mTOR signaling.']"""

The present study was undertaken to characterise the expression pattern of AR3 in normal and impaired spermatogenesis. Expression of AR3 mRNA showed significantly lower level in testicular tissues with impaired spermatogenesis when compared to normal tissues. This aberrant expression profile of AR3 in human pathological testes was further confirmed by immunoblotting analysis. Moreover, in situ hybridisation studies revealed that the transcripts of the gene were dominantly localised in the pachytene spermatocytes and round spermatids, suggesting a potential involvement of this transcriptional regulator in the auto-/paracrine regulation of meiotic and post-meiotic differentiation. This hypothesis was strengthened by the observation that AR3 mRNA expression was positively correlated to average seminiferous tubule score and was negatively correlated to serum FSH level. To the best of our knowledge, such a distinct expression profile of AR3 has not been reported previously in human testis. Overall, our data are suggestive of a novel site of action of AR3 during human spermatogenesis and should shed light on the complicated circuit composed of AR and its splice variants.""","""['F Tian', 'Y-S Wu', 'J Zhao', 'W Li']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Andrologia""","""['Prenatal maternal restraint stress exposure alters the reproductive hormone profile and testis development of the rat male offspring.', 'High expression of follicle stimulating hormone receptor in testicular tissue of idiopathic azoospermic patients with severe spermatogenic defects.', 'Insufficient androgen and FSH signaling may be responsible for the azoospermia of the infantile primate testes despite exposure to an adult-like hormonal milieu.', 'Predictors for partial suppression of spermatogenesis of hormonal male contraception.', 'Endocrine control of spermatogenesis in the ram.', 'Testicular STAC3 regulates Leydig cell steroidogenesis through potentiating mitochondrial membrane potential and StAR processing.']"""

Caveolin-1 and polymerase I and transcript release factor (PTRF)/cavin-1 are essential for caveola formation. Caveolin-1 is overexpressed and secreted in prostate tumors and promotes aggressiveness and angiogenesis. In contrast, a lack of PTRF expression is reported in prostate cancer, and ectopic PTRF expression in prostate cancer cells inhibits tumor growth and metastasis. We experimentally manipulated PTRF expression in three prostate cancer cell lines, namely the caveolin-1 positive cells PC3 and DU145 and the caveolin-1-negative LNCaP cells, to evaluate angiogenesis- and lymphangiogenesis-regulating functions of PTRF. We show that the conditioned medium of PTRF-expressing prostate cancer cells decreases ECs proliferation, migration and differentiation in vitro and ex vivo. This can occur independently from caveolin-1 expression and secretion or caveola formation, since the anti-angiogenic effects of PTRF were detected in caveolin-1-negative LNCaP cells. Additionally, PTRF expression in PC3 cells significantly decreased blood and lymphatic vessel densities in orthotopic tumors in mice. Our results suggest that the absence of PTRF in prostate cancer cells contributes significantly to tumour progression and metastasis by promoting the angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis potential of the cancer cells, and this could be exploited for therapy.""","""['Zeyad D Nassar', 'Hyeongsun Moon', 'Tam Duong', 'LiQi Neo', 'Michelle M Hill', 'Mathias Francois', 'Robert G Parton', 'Marie-Odile Parat']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['PTRF-cavin-1 expression decreases the migration of PC3 prostate cancer cells: role of matrix metalloprotease 9.', 'PTRF/cavin-1 neutralizes non-caveolar caveolin-1 microdomains in prostate cancer.', 'Caveola-forming proteins caveolin-1 and PTRF in prostate cancer.', 'Changes in caveolae, caveolin, and polymerase 1 and transcript release factor (PTRF) expression in prostate cancer progression.', 'Caveolin-1 and polymerase I and transcript release factor: new players in insulin-like growth factor-I receptor signaling.', 'Expression of the Cavin Family in Childhood Leukemia and Its Implications in Subtype Diagnosis and Prognosis Evaluation.', 'Caveolae-Associated Molecules, Tumor Stroma, and Cancer Drug Resistance: Current Findings and Future Perspectives.', 'Suppression of PTRF Alleviates Post-Infectious Irritable Bowel Syndrome via Downregulation of the TLR4 Pathway in Rats.', 'KLK3 SNP-SNP interactions for prediction of prostate cancer aggressiveness.', 'EWI-2 controls nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of EGFR signaling molecules and miRNA sorting in exosomes to inhibit prostate cancer cell metastasis.']"""

The central gland was defined as a combination of the central zone and transition zone. Two radiologists measured central gland extension below verumontanum using axial, coronal, and sagittal T2-weighted images and coregistration picture archiving and communication system software.  Results:   The final cohort consisted of 63 patients with a mean age of 60.2 years (standard deviation: 7.1, range: 43-76). The central gland extended below the verumontanum in 60/63 (95%) patients.

Whether prostate tumors change grade is a question that has implications for screening and treatment. Empirical data on tumor grade over time have become available from men biopsied regularly as part of active surveillance (AS). However, biopsy (BX) grade is subject to misclassification. In this article, we develop a model that allows for estimation of the time of grade change while accounting for the misclassification error from BX grade. We use misclassification rates from studies of prostate cancer BXs followed by radical prostatectomy. Estimation of the transition times from true low-grade to high-grade disease is conducted within a Bayesian framework. We apply our model to serial observations on BX grade among 627 cases enrolled in a cohort of AS patients at Johns Hopkins University who were biopsied annually and referred to treatment if there was any evidence of disease progression on BX. We consider different prior distributions for the time to true grade progression. The estimated likelihood of grade progression within 10 years of study entry ranges from 12% to 24% depending on the prior. We conclude that knowledge of rates of grade misclassification allows for determination of true grade progression rates among men with serial BXs on AS.

The main objectives of this study were to investigate BORIS expression together with sub-cellular localization in both prostate cell lines and tumor tissues, and assess correlations between BORIS and clinical/pathological characteristics.  Methods:   We examined BORIS mRNA expression, protein levels and cellular localization in a panel of human prostate tissues, cancer and benign, together with a panel prostate cell lines. We also compared BORIS levels and localization with clinical/pathological characteristics in prostate tumors.  Results:   BORIS was detected in all inspected prostate cancer cell lines and tumors, but was absent in benign prostatic hyperplasia. Increased levels of BORIS protein positively correlated with Gleason score, T-stage and androgen receptor (AR) protein levels in prostate tumors. The relationship between BORIS and AR was further highlighted in prostate cell lines by the ability of ectopically expressed BORIS to activate the endogenous AR mRNA and protein. BORIS localization in the nucleus plus cytoplasm was also associated with higher BORIS levels and Gleason score.  Conclusions:   Detection of BORIS in prostate tumors suggests potential applications of BORIS as a biomarker for prostate cancer diagnosis, as an immunotherapy target and, potentially, a prognostic marker of more aggressive prostate cancer.

Patients and methods:   Between 2007 and 2012, 84 consecutive patients with clinically localized prostate cancer submitted to radical prostatectomy were also treated with irradiation to the prostate bed. Forty-five received 3DCRT and 39 Hypo-RapidArc. The median age was 67 and 69 years for 3DCRT and Hypo-RapidArc groups respectively. The median dose to the prostatic bed was 70 Gy in both groups: 2 Gy/fraction in the 3DCRT group and 2.5 Gy/fraction in the Hypo-RapidArc group. After radical prostatectomy, the median time-to-RT was 15 and 16 months respectively. Acute and late toxicities were scored according to the Radiation Therapy and Oncology Group/European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer system.  Results:   Grade 2aGU was recorded in 16% of cases in the 3DRCT group and in 10% in the Hypo-RapidArc group. No acute grade 2 upper gastrointestinal (uGI) toxicities were found in the 3DCRT versus 5% in the Hypo-RapidArc group. The incidence of grade 2 lower gastrointestinal (lGI) toxicities was 22% in the 3DCRT group versus 15% in the Hypo-RapidArc group. No grade 3 or greater toxicities were found in either group. In both groups, good planning target volume coverage was achieved: V95% was recorded as 96.3 ± 3.6% (mean ± standard deviation) and 95.7 ± 8.9 for the 3DRCT and the Hypo-RapidArc groups, respectively.

In contrast to high Id1, Id2 and Id3 expression, the expression of Id4 is epigenetically silenced in prostate cancer. In the present study we demonstrated a novel role of Id4, that of promotion of cellular senescence in prostate cancer cells.  Materials and methods:   Id4 was ectopically expressed in DU145 cells (DU145+Id4). The cells treated with Doxorubicin (0-500 nm) or vehicle control were analyzed for apoptosis, senescence (SA-beta Galactosidase), and expression of CDKN1A (p21), CDKN1B(p27), CDKN2A (p16), E2F1, vimentin and E-cadherin by immuno-histochemistry and/or Western blot.  Results:   In the present study we demonstrated that Id4 promotes cellular senescence in prostate cancer cell line DU145.

Method:   A questionnaire about ADT side effects and management strategies was distributed to physicians-urologists, radiation oncologists, and medical oncologists - actively practicing within cancer and urology centers in the Canadian provinces of British Columbia, Alberta, Ontario, and the Maritime Provinces.  Result:   A total of 75 physicians filled out the survey. Physicians agreed that osteoporosis, erectile dysfunction, hot flashes, loss of libido, and loss of muscle mass were drug responses that were essential or important to warn patients about. However, for six commonly reported side effects (i.e. depression, diabetes, elevated cholesterol, anemia, delayed or absent orgasm, and genital shrinkage), physicians showed great variance, with less than 60% agreeing on whether to discuss these topics or not.  Conclusion:   There is little consensus among physicians regarding what to tell patients when prescribing this treatment. The lack of agreement among physicians may partially explain the lack of awareness of ADT side effects by patients and partners.

Methods:   A population-based cohort of male Medicare beneficiaries aged 66 to 99 years, who had never been diagnosed with prostate cancer at the end of 2006 (n = 94,652), was assembled, and they were followed for 3 years to assess the cost of PSA screening and downstream procedures (biopsy, pathologic analysis, and hospitalization due to biopsy complications) at both the national and the hospital referral region (HRR) level.  Results:   Approximately 51.2% of men received PSA screening tests during the 3-year period, with 2.9% undergoing biopsy. The annual expenditures on prostate cancer screening by the national fee-for-service Medicare program were $447 million in 2009 US dollars. The mean annual screening cost at the HRR level ranged from $17 to $62 per beneficiary. Downstream biopsy-related procedures accounted for 72% of the overall screening costs and varied significantly across regions.

The purpose of the current study was to develop a LE prediction model among patients receiving palliative radiotherapy (RT) that identifies those patients with short (< 3 months) and long (> 1 year) LEs.  Methods:   The records of 862 patients with metastatic cancer receiving palliative RT at the Dana-Farber/Brigham and Women's Cancer Center between June 2008 and July 2011 were retrospectively reviewed. Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate established and potential clinical predictors of LE to construct a model predicting LE of < 3 months and > 1 year.  Results:   The median survival was 5.6 months. On multivariate analysis, factors found to be significantly associated with a shorter LE were cancer type (lung and other vs breast and prostate), older age (> 60 years vs ≤ 60 years), liver metastases, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (2-4 vs 0-1), hospitalizations within 3 months before palliative RT (0 vs ≥ 1), and prior palliative chemotherapy courses (≥ 2 vs 0-1). Patients were divided into 3 groups with distinct median survivals: group A (those with 0-1 risk factors), 19.9 months (95% confidence interval [95% CI, 13.9 months-31.1 months]); group B (those with 2-4 risk factors), 5.0 months (95% CI, 4.3 months -5.6 months); and group C (those with 5-6 risk factors), 1.7 months (95% CI, 1.2 months-2.1 months).  Conclusions:   The TEACHH model (type of cancer, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, age, prior palliative chemotherapy, prior hospitalizations, and hepatic metastases) divides patients receiving palliative RT into 3 distinct LE groups at clinically informative extremes of the LE spectrum.

Then, cell proliferation, telomerase enzyme activity, actin polymerization, and apoptosis were detected by WST-1 assay, qRT-PCR, immunofluorescence labeling, and flow cytometry, respectively. We found that DPD inhibited the growth of human prostate cancer cell line DU145 at the concentration of 3.5 mM for 24 h. Our results demonstrated that 7 mM of DPD treatment prevented the telomerase enzyme activity at the rate of 38 %. Furthermore, DPD has an apoptotic effect on DU145 cells which were examined by labeling DNA breaks. With 7 mM of DPD treatment, 8, 14, and 41 % of apoptotic cells were detected for 24, 48, and 72 h, respectively. Additionally, immunofluorescence labeling showed that the normal organization of actin filaments was disrupted in DPD-exposed cells, which is accompanied by the alteration of cell shape and by apoptosis in targeted cells. Taken together, the results indicate that DPD may exert its cytotoxicity at least partly by interfering with the dynamic properties of actin polymerization and decreasing the telomerase activity. Eventually, for the first time, the results of this study showed that DPD suppressed the activity of telomerase in DU145 cells, and therefore, we suggested that DPD could be an important agent for its therapeutic potential in the treatment of prostate cancer.""","""['Mehmet Korkmaz', 'Cigir Biray Avcı', 'Cumhur Gunduz', 'Duygu Aygunes', 'Burcu Erbaykent-Tepedelen']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Tumour Biol""","""['Investigation of cytotoxic and apoptotic effects of disodium pentaborate decahydrate on ovarian cancer cells and assessment of gene profiling.', 'Borax Pentahydrate and Disodium Pentaborate Decahydrate Are Candidates as Anti-leukemic Drug Components by Inducing Apoptosis and Changing Bax/Bcl-2 Ratio in HL-60 Cell Line.', 'Genistein represses telomerase activity via both transcriptional and posttranslational mechanisms in human prostate cancer cells.', 'Inhibition of telomerase with human telomerase reverse transcriptase antisense increases the sensitivity of tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced apoptosis in prostate cancer cells.', 'Genistein induces cell growth inhibition in prostate cancer through the suppression of telomerase activity.', 'Development of antimicrobial gelatin films with boron derivatives.', 'Loss of scinderin decreased expression of epidermal growth factor receptor and promoted apoptosis of castration-resistant prostate cancer cells.', 'Effect of Achillea wilhelmsii extract on expression of the human telomerase reverse transcriptase mRNA in the PC3 prostate cancer cell line.']"""

Ipilimumab leads to a release of a CTLA4-mediated inhibition of T-cell immunoreactions. Therefore, patients may also suffer from immune-related adverse events affecting different organs, which are typically treated by high-dose corticosteroids. Ipilimumab-induced hypophysitis (iH) has been reported in up to 17% of melanoma patients in clinical trials.Here we present 5 patients with metastatic melanoma and 2 patients with prostate cancer who developed hypophysitis after ipilimumab therapy. Patients were treated by high-dose corticosteroid therapy resulting in the resolution of local inflammation but not of pituitary deficiencies. Partial or complete hypopituitarism remained in all patients. Pharmacotherapy with high-dose corticosteroids caused complications in 5 patients, necessitating hospitalization in 4. 2 of the 3 patients with progressive disease died, while 3 patients had stable disease and 1 patient showed tumor regression after discontinuation of ipilimumab.In summary, with regard to safety and simplicity of hormonal substitution therapy we have to scrutinize high-dose corticosteroid therapy, though it only improves inflammation but not neuro-endocrine function and may cause further morbidity. Regression of the tumor depends on the ipilimumab-mediated immune events, in which high-dose and long-term corticosteroid therapy for iH appears to be counter-intuitive.

However, the detailed pathophysiological roles of KLK2 in PCa remain unclear. We report here that KLK2 may be treated as a potential therapeutic target in castration-resistant PCa (CRPC). Histologic analyses show that the increased KLK2 expression is correlated with higher cell proliferation rate and lower cell apoptosis index in CRPC specimens. Adding functional KLK2 cDNA into high passage LNCaP cells led to increased cell growth, and knockdown of KLK2 expression with KLK2-siRNA in LNCaP cells resulted in increased cell apoptosis with cell growth arrest at the G1 phase. Results from in vitro colony formation assay and in vivo xenografted PCa tissues also demonstrated that targeting KLK2 led to suppressed growth of PCa in the castration-resistant stage. Further mechanism dissection shows that KLK2 may cooperate with the AR coregulator, ARA70, to enhance AR transactivation that may result in alteration of PCa formation. Together, these results suggested KLK2 might become a new therapeutic target to battle the CRPC and KLK2-siRNA may be developed as an alternative approach to suppress PCa growth.""","""['Zhiqun Shang', 'Yuanjie Niu', 'Qiliang Cai', 'Jing Chen', 'Jing Tian', 'Shuyuan Yeh', 'Kuo-Pao Lai', 'Chawnshang Chang']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Tumour Biol""","""['Increased PrLZ-mediated androgen receptor transactivation promotes prostate cancer growth at castration-resistant stage.', 'Functional domain and motif analyses of androgen receptor coregulator ARA70 and its differential expression in prostate cancer.', 'Tissue prostate-specific antigen facilitates refractory prostate tumor progression via enhancing ARA70-regulated androgen receptor transactivation.', 'New therapeutic approach to suppress castration-resistant prostate cancer using ASC-J9 via targeting androgen receptor in selective prostate cells.', 'Androgen receptor: what we know and what we expect in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Quercetin can be a more reliable treatment for metastatic prostate cancer than the localized disease: An in vitro study.', 'Towards Understanding the Key Signature Pathways Associated from Differentially Expressed Gene Analysis in an Indian Prostate Cancer Cohort.', 'α-Mangostin Promotes In Vitro and In Vivo Degradation of Androgen Receptor and AR-V7 Splice Variant in Prostate Cancer Cells.', ""BRG1: Promoter or Suppressor of Cancer?

In human prostate cancer cells, androgen glucuronidation, catalyzed by the two UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzymes UGT2B15 and UGT2B17, is the major androgen inactivation pathway. In this study, we investigated the effect of ADTh on androgen glucuronidation to evaluate its potential clinical utility for prostate cancer prognosis or therapy. UGT2B15 and UGT2B17 expression was evaluated in prostate cancer specimens from untreated or treated patients and in cell models of prostate cancer exposed to clinically relevant antiandrogens. UGT2B15 and UGT2B17 protein levels in prostate were increased after 5 months of ADTh when compared with specimens from untreated patients. UGT2B15 expression remained elevated for up to 12 months, but UGT2B17 returned to initial levels as soon as after 6 months. Several androgen receptor (AR) antagonists tested caused a dose- and time-dependent stimulation of UGT2B15 and UGT2B17 expression and androgen glucuronidation in prostate cancer cell lines. The role of AR in these regulatory events was confirmed using AR-deficient LNCaP cells, in which UGT2B attenuation reduced the antiproliferative effects of AR pharmacologic antagonists.

In human prostate cancers, we found that HO-1 was nuclear localized in malignant cells, with low enzymatic activity in moderately differentiated tumors correlating with relatively worse clinical outcomes.

Although initially beneficial as judged with actual tumor mass shrinkage, this therapy invariably fails and the cancer reappears as castration-resistant disease. Here, we report that increased intracellular nitric oxide (NO) levels lead to growth inhibition of both androgen-dependent and castration-resistant prostate tumors through a mechanism that involves AR function inactivation by S-nitrosylation of a single C601 residue present in the DNA-binding domain. AR S-nitrosylation does not impact its subcellular distribution but attenuates its ability to bind AR-responsive elements in promoter region of target genes. Mechanistically, AR is transnitrosylated by its partner HSP90 protein. Ubiquitous small-molecule NO donors promote the AR S-nitrosylation and inhibit growth of castration-resistant prostate tumors. These findings reveal a new mechanism of regulating AR function and suggest that sequential targeting of distinct domains of AR may extend therapeutic efficacy for patients with advanced prostate cancer.""","""['Yu Qin', 'Anindya Dey', 'Hamsa Thayele Purayil', 'Yehia Daaka']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Cancer Res""","""['Targeting the BAF57 SWI/SNF subunit in prostate cancer: a novel platform to control androgen receptor activity.', 'Strategy for Tumor-Selective Disruption of Androgen Receptor Function in the Spectrum of Prostate Cancer.', 'Lupeol, a novel androgen receptor inhibitor: implications in prostate cancer therapy.', 'The role of the androgen receptor in the development of prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptor antagonists for prostate cancer therapy.', 'Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS)-NO signaling axis functions to promote the growth of prostate cancer stem-like cells.', 'Protein S-nitrosylation and oxidation contribute to protein misfolding in neurodegeneration.', 'S-Nitrosylation in Tumor Microenvironment.', 'Leucine Zipper-EF-Hand Containing Transmembrane Protein 1 Is a Potential Prognostic Biomarker and Promotes Cell Progression in Prostate Cancer.', 'Targeting the SPOCK1-snail/slug axis-mediated epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition by apigenin contributes to repression of prostate cancer metastasis.']"""

Methods:   To explore an apoptotic signaling of KR28, we used ROS assay, SRB assay, flow cytometry analysis, reporter assay, xenograft assay, Western blotting, and RT-PCR analysis.  Results:   The growth inhibitory action of KR28 is cell line specific, impeding the growth of prostate carcinoma PC-3 and stomach carcinoma NUGC-3 cells. KR28 showed strong antitumor activity in PC-3 mouse xenograft model. KR28 increased ROS production, leading to nuclear c-Abl expression, which in turn activated p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) to enhance the expression of RhoB, an apoptosis inducer. The KR28-induced apoptosis was abrogated by the ROS scavenger N-acetylcysteine and by knockdown of c-Abl, p38 MAPK, or ATF2. Moreover, the p300 binding site and two CCAAT boxes in the RhoB promoter appear to be involved in ROS-mediated RhoB expression in the presence of KR28.

N1 and N2 cells were established through serial intraprostatic propagation of 103E human PCa cells and isolation of the metastatic cells from nearby lymph nodes. The invasion capability of these cells was revealed to gradually increase throughout the serial isolations (103E<N1<N2). In this series of cells, the expression of HAI-2 but not HAI-1 was significantly decreased throughout the progression and occurred in parallel with increased activation of matriptase. The expression level and activity of matriptase increased whereas the HAI-2 protein level decreased over the course of orthotopic tumor growth in mice, which was consistent with the immunohistochemical profiles of matriptase and HAI-2 in archival PCa specimens. Knockdown of matriptase reduced the PCa cell invasion induced by HAI-2 knockdown. HAI-2 overexpression or matriptase silencing in N2 cells downregulated matriptase activity and significantly decreased tumorigenicity and metastatic capability in orthotopically xenografted mice. These results suggest that during the progression of human PCa, matriptase activity is primarily controlled by HAI-2 expression.

Cooking methods could modify the magnitude of this association, as production of chemicals depends on the temperature and duration of cooking.  Methods:   We analyzed data from a network of case-control studies conducted in Italy and Switzerland between 1991 and 2009. The studies included 1465 oral and pharyngeal, 198 nasopharyngeal, 851 laryngeal, 505 esophageal, 230 stomach, 1463 colon, 927 rectal, 326 pancreatic, 3034 breast, 454 endometrial, 1031 ovarian, 1294 prostate and 767 renal cancer cases. Controls included 11 656 patients admitted for acute, non-neoplastic conditions. Odds ratios (ORs) and confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated by multiple logistic regression models, adjusted for known confounding factors.  Results:   Daily intake of red meat was significantly associated with the risk of cancer of the oral cavity and pharynx (OR for increase of 50 g/day = 1.38; 95% CI: 1.26-1.52), nasopharynx (OR = 1.29; 95% CI: 1.04-1.60), larynx (OR = 1.46; 95% CI: 1.30-1.64), esophagus (OR = 1.46; 95% CI: 1.23-1.72), colon (OR = 1.17; 95% CI: 1.08-1.26), rectum (OR = 1.22; 95% CI:1.11-1.33), pancreas (OR = 1.51; 95% CI: 1.25-1.82), breast (OR = 1.12; 95% CI: 1.04-1.19), endometrium (OR = 1.30; 95% CI: 1.10-1.55) and ovary (OR = 1.29; 95% CI: 1.16-1.43).

In the present study, the role of cellular redox and redox sensitive transcription factor, Nrf2 in the radiosensitivity of prostate cancer cell lines PC3 and DU145, has been investigated.  Materials and methods:   Differential radiosensitivity of PC3 and DU145 cells was assessed using clonogenic assay, flow cytometry, and comet assay. Their redox status was measured using DCFDA and DHR probes. Expression of Nrf2 and its dependent genes was measured by EMSA and real time PCR. Knockdown studies were done using shRNA transfection.  Results:   PC3 and DU145 cells differed significantly in their radiosensitivity as observed by clonogenic survival, apoptosis and neutral comet assays. Both basal and inducible levels of ROS were higher in PC3 cells than that of DU145 cells. DU145 cells showed higher level of basal GSH content and GSH/GSSG ratio than that of PC3 cells. Further, significant increase in both basal and induced levels of Nrf2 and its dependent genes was observed in DU145 cells. Knock-down experiments and pharmacological intervention studies revealed the involvement of Nrf2 in differential radio-resistance of these cells.  Conclusion:   Cellular redox status and Nrf2 levels play a causal role in radio-resistance of prostate cancer cells.

Incidence for ever-users, never-users, and subgroups of human insulin exposure (using tertile cutoffs of time since starting insulin, cumulative dose, and cumulative duration of insulin) were calculated, and the age-adjusted and multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios were estimated using Cox regression.  Results:   There were 72,948 ever-users and 425,459 never-users, with respective numbers of incident prostate cancer of 768 (1.05%) and 6282 (1.48%), and respective incidence of 236.87 and 276.88 per 100,000 person-years.

We evaluated the association between 47 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the VDR gene and prostate cancer risk as well as clinical characteristics (prostate-specific antigen level, clinical stage, pathological stage and Gleason score) in Korean men (272 prostate cancer patients and 173 benign prostatic hyperplasia patient who underwent a prostate biopsy, which was negative for malignancy) using unconditional logistic regression. The statistical analysis suggested that two VDR sequence variants (rs2408876 and rs2239182) had a significant association with prostate cancer risk (odds ratio [OR]. 1.41; p=0.03; OR, 0.73; p=0.05, respectively). Logistic analyses of the VDR polymorphisms with several prostate cancer related factors showed that several SNPs were significant; nine SNPs to PSA level, three to clinical stage, two to pathological stage, and three SNPs to the Gleason score. The results suggest that some VDR gene polymorphisms in Korean men might not only be associated with prostate cancer risk but also significantly related to prostate cancer-related risk factors such as PSA level, tumor stage, and Gleason score. However, current limitation for small cohort with not-healthy control group might have false positive effects; therefore it should be overcome via further large-scale validating studies.""","""['Jong Jin Oh', 'Seok-Soo Byun', 'Sang Eun Lee', 'Sung Kyu Hong', 'Chang Wook Jeong', 'Dokyoon Kim', 'Hae Jong Kim', 'Soon Chul Myung']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Gene""","""['Association of vitamin D receptor gene polymorphism with prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia in a Japanese population.', 'Association of genetic polymorphisms in vitamin D receptor gene and susceptibility to sporadic prostate cancer.', 'HNF1B polymorphism associated with development of prostate cancer in Korean patients.', 'Genetic variants in the vitamin d receptor are associated with advanced prostate cancer at diagnosis: findings from the prostate testing for cancer and treatment study and a systematic review.', 'Genetic polymorphisms of vitamin D receptor and the risk of prostate cancer: a meta-analysis.', 'Polygenic risk score for genetic evaluation of prostate cancer risk in Asian populations: A narrative review.', 'Whole Genome Analysis and Prognostic Model Construction Based on Alternative Splicing Events in Endometrial Cancer.', 'Predicting biomedical relationships using the knowledge and graph embedding cascade model.', 'Lack of association between the risk of prostate cancer and vitamin D receptor Bsm I polymorphism: a meta-analysis of 27 published studies.', 'Vitamin D receptor Taq I polymorphism and the risk of prostate cancer: a meta-analysis.']"""

We reviewed 42 oncologic patients with ONJ between 2007 and 2010. Only patients with solids tumors and who had received ZA were included. Data analyses included age, sex, underlying disease, ZA and BVZ dosages, dental history and ONJ characteristics. Of the 42 ONJ patients treated with ZA, 10 also received BVZ. In the 10 ZA/BVZ patients, the mean duration of ZA treatment at the time of ONJ diagnosis was 12.4 months (±6.8), compared to 22.9 months (±4.8) in the 32 patients who received ZA only (p<0.05). Cox's model analysis of the delay to ONJ diagnosis confirmed the impact of BVZ on ONJ diagnosis. In the ZA/BVZ-treated group, 7 (70%) patients developed spontaneous osteonecrosis. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that ZA/BVZ is associated with increased risk of developing spontaneous ONJ (OR 6.07; 95% CI, [1.3-28.2], p<0.05). And finally, the number of ONJ lesions was increased in the ZA/BVZ-treated group compared to the ZA group (p<0.01). Other clinical conditions as type of tumor (prostate, breast…), cancer severity or other chemotherapy drugs also could be involved in ONJ evolution. However, this study demonstrates for the first time the potential negative influence of BVZ on the incidence and severity of ONJ in patients receiving ZA.

To quantify the extent of these trends and the recent burden of cancer, here we present a comprehensive overview of trends in population-based incidence of the five common cancers across Europe derived from a new web-based portal of the European cancer registries.  Methods:   Data on incidence for cancers of the colon and rectum, prostate, breast, corpus uteri and stomach diagnosed from 1988 to 2008 were obtained from the European Cancer Observatory for cancer registries from 26 countries. Annual age-standardised incidence rates and average annual percentage changes were calculated.  Results:   Incidence of four common cancers in eastern and central European countries (prostate, postmenopausal breast, corpus uteri and colorectum) started to approach levels in northern and western Europe, where rates were already high in the past but levelled off in some countries in recent years. Decreases in stomach cancer incidence were seen in all countries.  Discussion:   Increasing trends in incidence of the most common cancers, except stomach cancer, are bad news to public health but can largely be explained by well-known changes in society in the past decades. Thus, current and future efforts in primary cancer prevention should not only remain focussed on the further reduction of smoking but engage in the long-term efforts to retain healthy lifestyles, especially avoiding excess weight through balanced diets and regular physical exercise.""","""['Melina Arnold', 'Henrike E Karim-Kos', 'Jan Willem Coebergh', 'Graham Byrnes', 'Ahti Antilla', 'Jacques Ferlay', 'Andrew G Renehan', 'David Forman', 'Isabelle Soerjomataram']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Eur J Cancer""","""['Convergence of decreasing male and increasing female incidence rates in major tobacco-related cancers in Europe in 1988-2010.', 'Cancer incidence and mortality patterns in South Eastern Europe in the last decade: gaps persist compared with the rest of Europe.', 'Recent trends of cancer in Europe: a combined approach of incidence, survival and mortality for 17 cancer sites since the 1990s.', 'Socioeconomic differences in cancer survival: a review of the evidence.', 'Five common cancers in Iran.', 'Transperineal US-MRI Fusion-Guided Biopsy for the Detection of Clinical Significant Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Comparing Cognitive and Software-Assisted Technique.', 'Updates on global epidemiology, risk and prognostic factors of gastric cancer.', 'The Potential of Liquid Biopsy in Detection of Endometrial Cancer Biomarkers: A Pilot Study.', 'Cell Viability Assays for 3D Cellular Constructs.', 'Construction of an RNA modification-related gene predictive model associated with prognosis and immunity in gastric cancer.']"""

Methods and materials:   Patient self-reported QOL was prospectively measured among 864 patients from phase 2 clinical trials of SBRT for localized prostate cancer. Data from the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) instrument were obtained at baseline and at regular intervals up to 6 years. SBRT delivered a median dose of 36.25 Gy in 4 or 5 fractions. A short course of androgen deprivation therapy was given to 14% of patients.  Results:   Median follow-up was 3 years and 194 patients remained evaluable at 5 years. A transient decline in the urinary and bowel domains was observed within the first 3 months after SBRT which returned to baseline status or better within 6 months and remained so beyond 5 years. The same pattern was observed among patients with good versus poor baseline function and was independent of the degree of early toxicities. Sexual QOL decline was predominantly observed within the first 9 months, a pattern not altered by the use of androgen deprivation therapy or patient age.  Conclusion:   Long-term outcome demonstrates that prostate SBRT is well tolerated and has little lasting impact on health-related QOL. A transient and modest decline in urinary and bowel QOL during the first few months after SBRT quickly recovers to baseline levels. With a large number of patients evaluable up to 5 years following SBRT, it is unlikely that unexpected late adverse effects will manifest themselves.""","""['Christopher R King', 'Sean Collins', 'Donald Fuller', 'Pin-Chieh Wang', 'Patrick Kupelian', 'Michael Steinberg', 'Alan Katz']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Patient-reported outcomes following stereotactic body radiation therapy for clinically localized prostate cancer.', 'Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for prostate cancer in men with large prostates (≥50 cm(3)).', 'SHARP hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy is well tolerated in prostate cancer : Toxicity and quality of life assessment.', 'Focus on the expected quality of reporting in SBRT/radiosurgery prospective studies: how far have we come in 30 years?', 'Quality of Life After Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy or Surgery for Early-Stage NSCLC: A Systematic Review.', 'A Multicenter Phase 2 Study of Ultrahypofractionated Stereotactic Boost After External Beam Radiotherapy in Intermediate-risk Prostate Carcinoma: A Very Long-term Analysis of the CKNO-PRO Trial.', 'Normal Tissue Integral Dose as a Result of Prostate Radiation Therapy: A Quantitative Comparison Between High-Dose-Rate Brachytherapy and Modern External Beam Radiation Therapy Techniques.', 'Shorter Radiation Regimens and Treatment Noncompletion Among Patients With Breast and Prostate Cancer in the United States: An Analysis of Racial Disparities in Access and Quality.', 'Patient reported outcomes for quality of life (QOL) by Expanded Prostate Cancer Index (EPIC) on average 15 years post treatment.', 'Reducing ExacTrac intrafraction imaging uncertainty for prostate stereotactic body radiotherapy using a pre-treatment CBCT.']"""

This study investigates whether these in vitro observations can be reconciled with in vivo knowledge and how signaling may have an impact on future developments in radiation therapy.  Methods and materials:   Prostate cancer treatment plans were generated for a series of 10 patients using 3-dimensional conformal therapy, intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), and volumetric modulated arc therapy techniques. These plans were evaluated using mathematical models of survival following modulated radiation exposures that were developed from in vitro observations and incorporate the effects of intercellular signaling. The impact on dose-volume histograms and mean doses were evaluated by converting these survival levels into ""signaling-adjusted doses"" for comparison.  Results:   Inclusion of intercellular communication leads to significant differences between the signalling-adjusted and physical doses across a large volume. Organs in low-dose regions near target volumes see the largest increases, with mean signaling-adjusted bladder doses increasing from 23 to 33 Gy in IMRT plans. By contrast, in high-dose regions, there is a small decrease in signaling-adjusted dose due to reduced contributions from neighboring cells, with planning target volume mean doses falling from 74 to 71 Gy in IMRT. Overall, however, the dose distributions remain broadly similar, and comparisons between the treatment modalities are largely unchanged whether physical or signaling-adjusted dose is compared.  Conclusions:   Although incorporating cellular signaling significantly affects cell killing in low-dose regions and suggests a different interpretation for many phenomena, their effect in high-dose regions for typical planning techniques is comparatively small. This indicates that the significant signaling effects observed in vitro are not contradicted by comparison with clinical observations. Future investigations are needed to validate these effects in vivo and to quantify their ranges and potential impact on more advanced radiation therapy techniques.""","""['Stephen J McMahon', 'Conor K McGarry', 'Karl T Butterworth', ""Joe M O'Sullivan"", 'Alan R Hounsell', 'Kevin M Prise']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Proton radiotherapy for pediatric bladder/prostate rhabdomyosarcoma: clinical outcomes and dosimetry compared to intensity-modulated radiation therapy.', 'Dosimetric comparison of three-dimensional conformal proton radiotherapy, intensity-modulated proton therapy, and intensity-modulated radiotherapy for treatment of pediatric craniopharyngiomas.', 'Dosimetric and radiobiologic comparison of 3D conformal versus intensity modulated planning techniques for prostate bed radiotherapy.', 'Precautions in the use of intensity-modulated radiation therapy.', 'Physical and methodological aspects of multimodality imaging and principles of treatment planning in 3D conformal radiotherapy.', 'Hadrontherapy Interactions in Molecular and Cellular Biology.', 'Modelling responses to spatially fractionated radiation fields using preclinical image-guided radiotherapy.', 'Exploiting sensitization windows of opportunity in hyper and hypo-fractionated radiation therapy.']"""

Objective:   To evaluate the effect of a lifestyle intervention on disease-specific QoL, diastolic blood pressure, and cancer-related fatigue in sedentary men receiving long-term ADT for advanced prostate cancer.  Design, setting, and participants:   A total of 100 hundred sedentary men with locally advanced or metastatic prostate cancer on long-term ADT were randomised to an intervention or usual care group.  Intervention:   A 12-wk lifestyle intervention consisting of aerobic and resistance exercise with parallel dietary advice.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Disease-specific QoL was measured using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate (FACT-P) and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Fatigue (FACT-F) questionnaires at 12 wk postintervention and at 6 mo following withdrawal of support. Analysis of covariance and mixed regression were conducted.  Results and limitations:   Clinically relevant improvements in FACT-P were seen at 12 wk in the intervention group compared with controls (mean difference: 8.9 points; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.7-14.2; adjusted p=0.001).

Patients and methods:   We identified 201 patients who underwent radical cystectomy (RC) between 1980 and 2006 and were found to have UC involving the prostate. All specimens were re-reviewed by a genitourinary pathologist. Survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared with the log-rank test. Cox hazard regression models tested the association of clinicopathological variables with outcome.  Results:   In all, 93 patients had pTis disease in the prostate, 43 had pT2 tumours, and 66 patients were pT4a. The median follow-up was 10.5 years. The 5-year cancer-specific survival for patients with pTis, pT2, and pT4a prostate UC was 73%, 57%, and 21% respectively (P < 0.001). On multivariable analysis, higher prostate tumour stage (hazard ratio [HR] 2.09; P = 0.01), positive lymph node status (HR 2.09; P = 0.002), and concurrent ≥pT3 bladder cancer (HR 4.16; P < 0.001) were significantly associated with an increased risk of death from UC.

Total body non-osseous lean mass (TBLM) and right thigh non-osseous fat-free mass (RTLM) were assessed using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Peak torque of the right knee extensors at 0° s(-1) (ISO) and 60° s(-1) (CON), maximal handgrip strength of the dominant hand (MHS) and whole-body strength (WBS) were assessed. ISO and CON per unit mass of RTLM and MHS and WBS per unit mass of TBLM were calculated.

Aims:   Our study aims were twofold: (i) to determine whether the impact of treatment on patients and partners moderate over time and (ii) if receiving surgery (i.e., radical prostatectomy) influences partner issues more than other treatments.  Methods:   Patients newly diagnosed with localized prostate cancer and their female partners were recruited from three states to complete surveys by mail at three time points over 12 months.

In men with prostate cancer, androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) accelerates this loss of muscle size and strength, but it is unknown if muscle quality is also adversely affected. Therefore, we examined the effects of ADT on muscle attenuation, an indirect measure of intramuscular lipid content, as well as the muscle cross-sectional area (CSA) in men with prostate cancer.  Methods:   Pre- and post-CT scans of the pelvis in 39 men aged 49-78 years receiving leuprorelin were examined. The time between baseline and follow-up scans was 14.6-20 weeks after the commencement of ADT. Changes in skeletal muscle attenuation in Hounsfield units of the rectus femoris and the CSA of the rectus femoris, sartorius and quadricep muscles were assessed.  Results:   Muscle attenuation of the rectus femoris muscle was significantly reduced following the initiation of ADT by 18.9% (P < 0.001). In addition, there was a significant decrease (P < 0.001) in the CSA for the sartorius, quadriceps and rectus femoris muscles. There was no effect of Zometa on muscle attenuation or muscle CSA.  Conclusions:   Our results indicate that not only muscle size but also muscle quality may be adversely affected by the undertaking of ADT in men with prostate cancer. Consequently, interventions to counteract deteriorations to both muscle mass and possibly muscle quality should be considered in men receiving ADT.""","""['David Chang', 'David J Joseph', 'Martin A Ebert', 'Daniel A Galvão', 'Dennis R Taaffe', 'James W Denham', 'Robert U Newton', 'Nigel A Spry']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Med Imaging Radiat Oncol""","""['The clinical relevance of adiposity when assessing muscle health in men treated with androgen deprivation for prostate cancer.', 'Targeting muscle signaling pathways to minimize adverse effects of androgen deprivation.', 'Muscle and bone effects of androgen deprivation therapy: current and emerging therapies.', 'Bone loss after initiation of androgen deprivation therapy in patients with prostate cancer.', 'Changes in muscle, fat and bone mass after 36 weeks of maximal androgen blockade for prostate cancer.', 'Relationship between Testosterone and Sarcopenia in Older-Adult Men: A Narrative Review.', 'Clinical Features and Body Composition in Men with Hormone-Sensitive Metastatic Prostate Cancer: A Pilot Study Examining Differences by Race.', 'Quality of Life of Prostate Cancer Survivors Participating in a Remotely Delivered Web-Based Behavioral Intervention Pilot Randomized Trial.', 'Muscle wasting assessment tools for prostate cancer.', 'Androgen Deprivation Therapy Differentially Impacts Bone and Muscle in the Short Term in Physically Active Men With Prostate Cancer.']"""

Survival benefits from neo-adjuvant and adjuvant hormones may take years to manifest, and balancing this with potential morbidity of therapy can be challenging. This study aimed to assess whether education and short-term combined aerobic and resistance exercises could help to ameliorate the adverse side effects of ADT.  Methods:   Eight hundred fifty-nine patients with relapsed or metastatic prostate cancer on leuprorelin acetate were allocated to three interventional streams based on patient preference and medical fitness: supervised group (Face-to-Face) exercise sessions, home-based (At Home) exercise or a support programme for those incapable of exercising (Support). Patients enrolled onto Face to Face underwent measurement of body composition and cardiorespiratory fitness variables at baseline and programme completion. Patients in the exercise streams were surveyed to determine the programme's impact on physical fitness and well-being.  Results:   Statistically significant improvements (p < 0.001) were seen in all measured cardiorespiratory fitness and strength variables. Programme attrition rates were low (75/859; 8.7%), the primary reason for withdrawal being discontinuation of hormones (70%). Programme satisfaction was high, with 98% of surveyed patients reporting a positive impact on fitness and 97% planning to continue exercising after programme completion. At 6 months, improved physical and emotional well-being was reported by 93 and 79% of patients, respectively.

Cereblon (CRBN) expression was described to be essential for the activity of thalidomide. Furthermore, IMiD binding to CRBN is cytotoxic to multiple myeloma cells and absence of CRBN confers IMiDs resistance. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a potent pleiotropic cytokine that regulates plasma cell (PC) growth via the IL-6 receptor (IL-6R). IL-6/IL-6R autocrine activity is implicated in the development and progression of cancers including cervical cancer, prostate cancer, and multiple myeloma. The aim of the study was to evaluate CRBN and IL-6R expressions and their impact on clinical efficacy of dexamethasone-thalidomide therapy in multiple myeloma (MM) patients, in addition to their association with other clinical and prognostic parameters. Forty-six newly diagnosed MM patients were enrolled in the study. We measured CRBN expression prior to therapy initiation by real-time polymerase chain reaction in 46 bone marrow (BM) aspiration samples of patients and controls. In addition, IL-6R expression was evaluated on BM biopsies of patients and controls by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Twenty-eight males (60.9%) and 18 females (39.1%) were enrolled. The mean age was 65.11 ± 7.3 yr (range 39-77 yr). Median CRBN expression in 46 BM samples of MM patients was significantly higher than in controls (P < 0.001). Among established prognostic parameters, international staging system (ISS), serum beta-2-microglobulin (B2M), and serum albumin correlated reversely with CRBN expression. IL-6R expression was significantly higher in patients than in controls. IL-6R expression was significantly associated with response to treatment (P < 0.001), B2M (P = 0.032), and ISS (P = 0.028). Strong intensity expression was associated with low CRBN expression (P = 0.001).In conclusion, CRBN expression may provide a biomarker to predict response to IMiD in patients with MM and its high expression can serve as a marker of good prognosis. Strong IL-6R expression is associated with poor response to therapy in multiple myeloma patients and may be used as a prognostic marker.""","""['Ahmed M L Bedewy', 'Shereen M El-Maghraby']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Eur J Haematol""","""['Expression of cereblon protein assessed by immunohistochemicalstaining in myeloma cells is associated with superior response of thalidomide- and lenalidomide-based treatment, but not bortezomib-based treatment, in patients with multiple myeloma.', 'Thalidomide-based induction regimens are as effective as bortezomib-based regimens in elderly patients with multiple myeloma with cereblon expression.', 'High expression of cereblon (CRBN) is associated with improved clinical response in patients with multiple myeloma treated with lenalidomide and dexamethasone.', 'Cereblon -\u200a a new target of therapy in the treatment of multiple myeloma.', 'Molecular mechanism of action of immune-modulatory drugs thalidomide, lenalidomide and pomalidomide in multiple myeloma.', 'The CRBN, CUL4A and DDB1 Expression Predicts the Response to Immunomodulatory Drugs and Survival of Multiple Myeloma Patients.', 'The future of myeloma precision medicine: integrating the compendium of known drug resistance mechanisms with emerging tumor profiling technologies.', 'Expression of the IL-6 receptor alpha-chain (CD126) in normal and abnormal plasma cells in monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance and smoldering myeloma.']"""

Successful expansion of Denonvilliers' space was achieved with a range of 9-11 mm thickness covering the entire posterior prostate surface. Two freeze-thaw cycles were used to expand the iceball reaching the rectal wall as an end-point. Intraoperative transrectal ultrasound monitoring and temperature mapping in Denonvilliers' space by multiple thermocouples documented real-time iceball expansion up to 10 mm beyond the prostate, and safety in protecting the rectal wall from thermal injury.

Macroscopic identification of pelvic lymph nodes in surgical lymphadenectomy specimens can be difficult, with a potential for incomplete submission of lymph nodes for microscopic examination. This study was undertaken to determine whether complete sampling of lymphadenectomy specimens would improve the detection of metastatic disease in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy.  Methods and results:   We examined 109 pelvic lymphadenectomies accompanying radical prostatectomy specimens to assess the benefit of complete submission of the lymph node packets to detect extra lymph nodes and metastatic disease. We found that blocking the residual tissue, after all palpable lymph nodes had been identified, increased the mean number of lymph nodes from 3.8 to 10.8, with an average of 0.84 macroscopically undetectable nodes being recovered per block submitted. Metastatic prostate cancer was identified in eight cases, one of which had cancer in an impalpable lymph node only.

The present study aimed to explore the potential therapeutic effects of a CXCR4 antagonist in prostate cancer. The effect of SDF-1 and a CXCR4-specific antagonist, AMD3100, on human prostate cancer PC-3 cell proliferation and protein kinase B (Akt) signaling was assessed. Moreover, a PC-3 tumor xenograft model was used to evaluate the effect of AMD3100 on tumor growth and to identify the histopathological changes and immunohistochemical differences between AMD3100-treated and untreated groups. Cell proliferation was not significantly affected by SDF-1 or AMD3100 treatment in vitro. Western blot analysis revealed that SDF-1 stimulation enhanced the expression of phosphorylated Akt in the PC-3 cells, but that the SDF-1-induced expression of phosphorylated Akt was abrogated in the AMD3100-treated PC-3 cells. In the PC-3 tumor xenograft model, AMD3100 significantly inhibited tumor growth, while AMD3100-treated PC-3 tumors had lower levels of microvessel formation and a lower immunoreactivity for the proliferation marker Ki-67 and the anti-apoptotic marker Bcl-2 compared to control tumors in vivo. The CXCR4-specific antagonist inhibits SDF-1-induced CXCR4/Akt signal transduction, and effectively suppresses tumor growth in the PC-3 xenograft model.

The changes in gene expression in PNT1A and LNCaP cell lines under the influence of Selol were measured using a 96-well RT(2) Profiler ™PCR Array: Human Oxidative Stress and Antioxidant Defense, which arrayed 84 genes functionally involved in the cellular oxidative stress response. Based on the obtained data, LNCaP cells exhibited a significantly lower potential for antioxidant defence when compared to PNT1A cells. The response of the malignant LNCaP cells to exposure to Selol was significantly different from that of the normal PNT1A cells, especially after 48 h of incubation. In the case of LNCaP cells, Selol causes down-regulation of the expression of many vital genes.

We sought to develop and validate a prognostic model to predict OS in men who had progressed after first-line chemotherapy and were selected to receive second-line chemotherapy.  Methods:   Data from a phase III trial in men with mCRPC who had developed progressive disease after first-line chemotherapy (TROPIC trial) were used. The TROPIC was randomly split into training (n = 507) and testing (n = 248) sets. Another dataset consisting of 488 men previously treated with docetaxel (SPARC trial) was used for external validation. Adaptive least absolute shrinkage and selection operator selected nine prognostic factors of OS. A prognostic score was computed from the regression coefficients. The model was assessed on the testing and validation sets for its predictive accuracy using the time-dependent area under the curve (tAUC).  Results:   The nine prognostic variables in the final model were Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, time since last docetaxel use, measurable disease, presence of visceral disease, pain, duration of hormonal use, hemoglobin, prostate specific antigen, and alkaline phosphatase. The tAUCs for this model were 0.73 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.72 to 0.74) and 0.70 (95% CI = 0.68 to 0.72) for the testing and validation sets, respectively.  Conclusions:   A prognostic model of OS in the postdocetaxel, second-line chemotherapy, mCRPC setting was developed and externally validated. This model incorporates novel prognostic factors and can be used to provide predicted probabilities for individual patients and to select patients to participate in clinical trials on the basis of their prognosis.

Methods:   This was a retrospective study of archived serum samples from patients enlisted in our tissue bank. Patients over 50 years old, with PSA level of 4-10 ng/mL, a negative digital rectal examination, and received their first prostatic biopsy between April 2008 and April 2013, were recruited. The serum sample collected before biopsy was retrieved for the measurement of various PSA derivatives and the phi value was calculated for each patient. The performance of these parameters in predicting the prostatic biopsy results was assessed.  Results:   Two hundred and thirty consecutive patients, with 21 (9.13 %) diagnosed with PCa, were recruited for this study. Statistically significant differences between PCa patients and non-PCa patients were found for total PSA, PSA density, [-2]proPSA (p2PSA), free-to-total PSA ratio (%fPSA), p2PSA-to-free PSA ratio (%p2PSA), and phi.

Patients and methods:   Twenty-eight consecutive patients with biochemical relapse after radical prostatectomy were submitted to anti-3-18F-FACBC PET/CT and 11C-choline PET/CT to evaluate the site of disease recurrence. Androgen deprivation therapy was avoided in all cases. The primary end point was the overall detection rate of the 2 radiotracers. A patient-based analysis and a lesion-based analysis was performed. The target to background ratio (TBR) of each lesion was reported.  Results:   At the time of PET scan, mean age was 67 years and mean prostate specific antigen (PSA) relapse was 2.9 ng/mL (range: 0.2-14.6). In patient-based analyses, 11C-choline PET/CT was positive in 5 patients and negative in 23 (detection rate = 17.8%) and anti-3-18F-FACBC PET/CT was positive in 10 patients and negative in 18 (detection rate = 35.7%). All lesions that were positive using 11C-choline were positive using anti-3-18F-FACBC PET/CT but with the latter radiotracer, 11 (61.1%) additional tumors were identified including 5 (17.8%) additional patients. The TBR of anti-3-18F-FACBC was greater than 11C-choline in 15 of 18 lesions, confirming a better image quality and contrast.  Conclusion:   This preliminary study demonstrated that the detection rate of anti-3-18F-FACBC PET/CT is greater in comparison with 11C-choline, with approximately 20% of additional patients and approximately 60% additional lesions detected.

Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were calculated to compare the cancer incidence of these patients to the general population.  Results:   During a median observation period of 6.23 years, 3080 cancers developed among 70,513 hemorrhoid patients, with a follow-up period of 438,425.6 person-years, entailing the SIR of 1.52 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.47-1.58).

Materials and methods:   Before scheduled radical prostatectomy 11 patients were injected intravenously with (89)Zr-J591, followed 6 days later by whole body positron emission tomography. Patients underwent surgery the day after imaging. Specimens were imaged by ex vivo micro positron emission tomography and a custom 3 Tesla magnetic resonance scanner coil. Positron emission tomography images and histopathology were correlated.  Results:   Median patient age was 61 years (range 47 to 68), median prostate specific antigen was 5.2 ng/ml (range 3.5 to 12.0) and median biopsy Gleason score of the 11 index lesions was 7 (range 7 to 9). On histopathology 22 lesions were identified. Median lesion size was 5.5 mm (range 2 to 21) and median Gleason score after radical prostatectomy was 7 (range 6 to 9). Eight of 11 index lesions (72.7%) were identified by in vivo positron emission tomography. Lesion identification improved with increasing lesion size for in vivo and ex vivo positron emission tomography (each p <0.0001), and increasing Gleason score (p = 0.14 and 0.01, respectively).

We demonstrate, hypoxia promotes neuronal and neuroendocrine differentiation of NC cells and PCa cells, respectively, by inducing the miR-106 b~25 cluster. In turn, miR-106b~25 comprised of miR-106b, miR-93 and miR-25, down-regulates the transcriptional repressor REST, which represses neuron-specific protein-coding and miRNA genes. In prostate tumors of high Gleason score (≥ 8), an inverse trend was observed between REST and miR-106b~25 induction. Employing miRNA PCR arrays, we identified miRNAs up-regulated by hypoxia in LNCaP cells and REST-knockdown in NC cells. Significantly, a subset of miRNAs (miR-9, miR-25, miR-30d and miR302b) is up-regulated in high Gleason score (≥ 8) PCa, suggesting a mechanism by which NED contributes to PCa malignancy.

Bone cancers (either primary or metastatic) belong to the most dangerous tumors. Previous studies have demonstrated overexpression of steroid receptor coactivator-3 (SRC-3) in many cancers, such as breast cancer, prostate cancer, thyroid cancer, functioning in the regulation of cancer cell proliferation, invasion, and metastasis. However, so far, the expression and function of SRC-3 in bone cancers have not yet been clarified. In this study, nickel-intensified immunohistochemistry was conducted using a commercial tissue microarray (with 94 cases of bone cancer tissue and 10 normal bone tissues), and the 4-scoring system was employed to evaluate the expression levels of SRC-3 immunoreactivity. The results showed that in normal bone tissue, levels of SRC-3 are almost negative (score=0), the total positivity (score=1-3) of SRC-3 immunoreactivities in bone cancers was 74.47%. There were no significant differences in gender, status (malignant or benign) or (mean) age (p>0.05). The percentage of positivity was 77.78% in osteogenic tumors, 58.82% in cartilage tumors, 70% in giant cell tumors, 100% in hematopoietic tumors, 77.78% in miscellaneous lesions, and 75% in miscellaneous tumors. Age related differences of SRC-3 immunoreactivities were detected in cartilage tumors and giant cell tumors (p<0.05). The above results clearly demonstrated a high frequency of overexpression of SRC-3 immunoreactivities in different bone cancers, indicating its potential roles in the prognosis and treatment of these cancers.""","""['Fei Luo', 'Wei Li', 'Jiqiang Zhang', 'Ke Huang', 'Jingshu Fu', 'Zhao Xie']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Pathol Res Pract""","""['Immunohistochemical localization of steroid receptor coactivators in chondrosarcoma: an in vivo tissue microarray study.', 'Effect of low-dose tamoxifen on steroid receptor coactivator 3/amplified in breast cancer 1 in normal and malignant human breast tissue.', 'Expression pattern of stromal cell-derived factor-1 chemokine in invasive breast cancer is correlated with estrogen receptor status and patient prognosis.', 'SRC-3 has a role in cancer other than as a nuclear receptor coactivator.', 'The role of steroid receptor coactivator-3 (SRC-3) in human malignant disease.', 'SRC-3, a Steroid Receptor Coactivator: Implication in Cancer.', 'Molecular Characterisation of Canine Osteosarcoma in High Risk Breeds.', 'Imbalanced expression pattern of steroid receptor coactivator-1 and -3 in liver cancer compared with normal liver: An immunohistochemical study with tissue microarray.']"""

While multiple studies show evidence for expression of growth hormone (GH) and GHR mRNA in human cancer tissue, there is a lack of quantification and only a few cancer types have been investigated. The National Cancer Institute's NCI60 panel includes 60 cancer cell lines from nine types of human cancer: breast, CNS, colon, leukemia, melanoma, non-small cell lung, ovarian, prostate and renal. We utilized this panel to quantify expression of GHR, GH, prolactin receptor (PRLR) and prolactin (PRL) mRNA with real-time RT qPCR. Both GHR and PRLR show a broad range of expression within and among most cancer types. Strikingly, GHR expression is nearly 50-fold higher in melanoma than in the panel as a whole. Analysis of human metastatic melanoma biopsies confirmed GHR gene expression in melanoma tissue. In these human biopsies, the level of GHR mRNA is elevated in advanced stage IV tumor samples compared to stage III. Due to the novel finding of high GHR in melanoma, we examined the effect of GH treatment on three NCI60 melanoma lines (MDA-MB-435, UACC-62 and SK-MEL-5). GH increased proliferation in two out of three cell lines tested. Further analysis revealed GH-induced activation of STAT5 and mTOR in a cell line dependent manner. In conclusion, we have identified cell lines and cancer types that are ideal to study the role of GH and PRL in cancer, yet have been largely overlooked. Furthermore, we found that human metastatic melanoma tumors express GHR and cell lines possess active GHRs that can modulate multiple signaling pathways and alter cell proliferation. Based on this data, GH could be a new therapeutic target in melanoma.""","""['Elahu G Sustarsic', 'Riia K Junnila', 'John J Kopchick']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Biochem Biophys Res Commun""","""['Growth hormone (GH) receptors in prostate cancer: gene expression in human tissues and cell lines and characterization, GH signaling and androgen receptor regulation in LNCaP cells.', 'Growth hormone signaling in human T47D breast cancer cells: potential role for a growth hormone receptor-prolactin receptor complex.', 'The role of prolactin receptor in GH signaling in breast cancer cells.', 'Morphogenic and tumorigenic potentials of the mammary growth hormone/growth hormone receptor system.', 'The role of prolactin and growth hormone in breast cancer.', 'Small molecules to regulate the GH/IGF1 axis by inhibiting the growth hormone receptor synthesis.', 'Growth hormone receptor antagonism downregulates ATP-binding cassette transporters contributing to improved drug efficacy against melanoma and hepatocarcinoma in vivo.', 'Association Between Recombinant Growth Hormone Therapy and All-Cause Mortality and Cancer Risk in Childhood: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'Effects of Growth Hormone (GH) Supplementation on Dermatoscopic Evolution of Pigmentary Lesions in Children with Growth Hormone Deficiency (GHD).', 'Growth Hormone Upregulates Mediators of Melanoma Drug Efflux and Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition In Vitro and In Vivo.']"""

Two focus groups were conducted, involving six ADT and eight non-ADT patients respectively. Data were transcribed verbatim and themes developed using a general inductive thematic approach. Facilitators to physical activity common to both groups of cancer survivors included clinician and spousal involvement, with pre-existing co-morbidities and increased age cited as barriers by both groups. The ADT subgroup cited personal involvement as a facilitator to physical activity, with fatigue, reduced motivation and a relative lack of specific advice from their clinician as additional barriers. The non-ADT subgroup had no additional facilitators to physical activity but cited time constraints as a barrier. These results highlight the important role that cancer clinicians and spouses play in promoting physical activity for men with prostate cancer and how ADT may influence their other facilitators and barriers.

Methods:   We summarized the annual individual data of prostate-specific antigen-based population screening in Kanazawa, Japan, and analyzed the prostate cancer detection rates at first and repeat screening. The clinical characteristics were compared between patients detected at first and repeat screening. The patients were classified according to favorable or unfavorable clinical characteristics of cancer, and prostate-specific antigen kinetics were compared between the two groups.  Results:   From 2000 to 2011, 19 620 men participated in this screening program, and a total of 59 019 screenings were carried out. The total annual numbers of examinees increased, and the annual rates of first examinees gradually decreased. The annual detection rates of cancer at total screening decreased in the second year. The annual detection rate at first screening was not different from that in the first year. The rate of patients with favorable cancer features was significantly higher among patients detected at repeat screening than at first screening. The rates of patients with high prostate-specific antigen velocity and low prostate-specific antigen doubling time were significantly higher in unfavorable than favorable cancer patients in repeat screening.

The present study analyzes the toxicity and biochemical efficacy of SBRT in 100 consecutive prostate cancer patients treated with CyberKnife Robotic Radiosurgery System.  Methods:   One hundred patients were treated with SBRT at the Radiation Oncology department of San Bortolo Hospital, Vicenza, Italy. All patients included in this IRB-approved protocol-driven prospective study had biopsy-proven prostate cancer. Risk category was low in 41, intermediate in 42, and high in 17 patients. The patients were treated with CyberKnife-SBRT (CK-SBRT), the prescription dose was 35 Gy in five fractions, corresponding to 92 Gy in 2-Gy fractions (α/β =1.5 Gy); 29 patients also received androgen deprivation therapy (ADT).  Results:   Median follow-up was 36 months (range, 6-76 months). Acute Grade 2 genitourinary and gastrointestinal toxicity occurred in respectively 12% and 18% of the patients; there were no Grade 3 or higher acute toxicities. Late Grade 1, 2, and 3 genitourinary toxicities occurred in 4%, 3%, and 1% of the patients, respectively; late Grade 1 gastrointestinal toxicity occurred in two patients and Grade 2 toxicity in one patient; no late gastrointestinal toxicities of grade 3 or 4 were observed. Median PSA nadir was 0.45 ng/ml at 36 months for all patients. In the SBRT-monotherapy group, the median PSA nadir at 36 months was 0.62 ng/ml; in the ADT-SBRT group, it was 0.18 ng/ml. Four patients had clinical recurrence: one local, two lymph nodes, and one to the bone. Ninety-six patients had no evidence of biochemical or clinical recurrence. A benign PSA bounce of median 1.08 ng/ml occurred in 12% of the 71 SBRT monotherapy patients at a mean 23 months (range, 18-30 months).

One prominent change is an apparently genome-wide decrease in methylcytosine that is often ascribed to DNA hypomethylation at retroelements comprising nearly half the genome. DNA hypomethylation may allow reactivation of retroelements, enabling retrotransposition, and causing gene expression disturbances favoring tumor development. However, neither the extent of hypomethylation nor of retroelement reactivation are precisely known. We therefore assessed DNA methylation and expression of three major classes of retroelements (LINE-1, HERV-K, and AluY) in human urinary bladder cancer tissues and cell lines by pyrosequencing and quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, respectively. We found substantial global LINE-1 DNA hypomethylation in bladder cancer going along with a shift toward full-length LINE-1 expression. Thus, pronounced differences in LINE-1 expression were observed, which may be promoted, among others, by LINE-1 hypomethylation. Significant DNA hypomethylation was found at the HERV-K_22q11.23 proviral long terminal repeat (LTR) in bladder cancer tissues but without reactivation of its expression. DNA methylation of HERVK17, essentially absent from normal urothelial cells, was elevated in cell lines from invasive bladder cancers. Accordingly, the faint expression of HERVK17 in normal urothelial cells disappeared in such cancer cell lines. Of 16 additional HERV-Ks, expression of 7 could be detected in the bladder, albeit generally at low levels. Unlike in prostate cancers, none of these showed significant expression changes in bladder cancer. In contrast, expression of the AluYb8 but not of the AluYa5 family was significantly increased in bladder cancer tissues. Collectively, our findings demonstrate a remarkable specificity of changes in expression and DNA methylation of retroelements in bladder cancer with a significantly different pattern from that in prostate cancer.""","""['Ulrike Kreimer', 'Wolfgang A Schulz', 'Annemarie Koch', 'Günter Niegisch', 'Wolfgang Goering']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Front Oncol""","""['DNA methylation and expression of LINE-1 and HERV-K provirus sequences in urothelial and renal cell carcinomas.', 'Selective changes of retroelement expression in human prostate cancer.', 'DNA methylation alterations in urothelial carcinoma.', 'Methylation of endogenous human retroelements in health and disease.', 'Molecular biology of type A endogenous retrovirus.', 'HERVs and Cancer-A Comprehensive Review of the Relationship of Human Endogenous Retroviruses and Human Cancers.', 'DNA methylation status of interspersed repetitive sequences in patients with migraine.', 'Human endogenous retrovirus regulates the initiation and progression of cancers (Review).', 'Differential expression of an endogenous retroviral element HERV-K(HML-6) is associated with reduced survival in glioblastoma patients.', 'Ancient Adversary - HERV-K (HML-2) in Cancer.']"""

Reuse of controls by inverse probability weighting may be one way to obtain efficiency improvements, and it can be particularly advantageous when two or more endpoints are analyzed in the same cohort. The controls in a nested case-control design are often matched on additional factors than at risk status, and this should be taken into account when reusing controls. Although some studies have suggested methods for handling additional matching, a thorough investigation of how this affects parameter estimates and weights is lacking. Our aim is to provide such a discussion to help developing guidelines for practitioners. We demonstrate that it is important to adjust for the matching variables in regression analyses when the matching is broken. We present three types of estimators for the inverse sampling probabilities accounting for additional matching. One of these estimators was somewhat biased when the cases and controls were matched very closely. We investigated how additional matching affected estimates of interest, with varying degree of association between the matching variables and exposure/outcome. Strong associations introduced only a small bias when the matching variables were properly adjusted for. Sometimes, exposure variables, for example, blood samples, are analyzed in batches. Rather, strong batch effects had to be present before this introduced much bias when the matching was broken.

Methods:   Patients with metastatic PCa were abstracted from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (1998-2010). Most common metastatic sites within the entire population were described. Stratification was performed according to the presence of single or multiple (≥ 2 sites) metastases. Additionally, we evaluated the distribution of metastatic sites amongst patients with and without bone metastases.  Results:   Overall, 74,826 patients with metastatic PCa were identified. The most common metastatic sites were bone (84%), distant lymph nodes (10.6%), liver (10.2%), and thorax (9.1%). Overall, 18.4% of patients had multiple metastatic sites involved. When stratifying patients according to the site of metastases, only 19.4% of men with bone metastases had multiple sites involved.

We analyzed a large series of prostatectomies from patients with prostate cancer, hyperplastic prostate disease, and normal prostates to study extent and tumor-selectivity of ED-B expression.  Methods:   Using immunohistology, 68 adenocarcinomas of the prostate or prostate cancer-inflicted lymph nodes, 4 samples of benign prostatic hyperplasia, and 6 normal prostate glands were studied for ED-B expressing newly formed blood vessels. Further, we treated an advanced prostate cancer patient with the anti-ED-B antibody (131)I-L19SIP to study in vivo target accessibility.  Results:   ED-B-positive blood vessels were found significantly more frequent in prostate cancers as compared with peritumoral prostate tissues or normal prostate glands, independent of tumor differentiation. The ED-B-positive blood vessels' density was 97 (±23), 65 (±9), and 59 (±9)/mm(2) in G3, G2, and G1 prostate cancers, respectively, and 7 (±5)/mm(2) in normal prostate glands. In high-grade (G3) prostate cancers, also the peritumoral tissue showed a higher density of ED-B vessels than normal prostate glands. Similar results were obtained when ED-B-positive vessel density was expressed as a fraction of CD34-positive vessel density. Finally, selective uptake of ED-B-binding (131)I-L19SIP to tumor lesions was found in an advanced prostate cancer patient by whole-body planar scintigraphy.  Conclusions:   ED-B-positive blood vessels were found to a large extent in prostate cancer tissues, but only rarely in normal prostates or benign prostatic hyperplasia.

The conditional 5-year relative survival rate was estimated for every subsequent year of survival up to 15 years after diagnosis.  Results:   The conditional 5-year relative survival rate decreased with survival time from diagnosis. Excess mortality (conditional 5-year relative survival rate <95%) for patients with clinical T1 stage only became manifest 5 years after diagnosis and increased to almost 10% after 10 years. Patients with more advanced disease (cT2-cT4) were found to have an excess mortality rate of 6-12% at diagnosis, which increased to 15-22% after 10 years. Excess mortality occurred earlier for the older age groups.

Patients and methods:   A cohort of 77 consecutive men undergoing AUS implantation for stress urinary incontinence after prostate cancer surgery, including 29 who had also been irradiated, were included in a prospective database and followed up for a mean period of 21.2 months. Continence rates and incidence of complications, revision and cuff erosion were evaluated, with results in irradiated men compared with those of men who had undergone radical prostatectomy alone. The effect of co-existing hypertension, diabetes mellitus and surgical approach on outcomes were also examined.  Results:   Overall, the rate of social continence (0-1 pad/day) was 87% and similar in irradiated and non-irradiated men (86.2 vs 87.5%). Likewise, the incidence of infection (3.4 vs 0%), erosion (3.4 vs 2.0%) and revision surgery (10.3 vs 12.5%) were not significantly different between the groups. There was a far greater incidence of co-existing urethral stricture disease in irradiated patients (62.1 vs 10.4%) which often complicated management; however, AUS implantation was still feasible in these men and, in four such cases, a transcorporal cuff placement was used. There were poorer outcomes in patients with diabetes, and a greater re-operation rate in those men who underwent a transverse scrotal rather than perineal surgical approach, although the differences did not reach statistical significance.  Conclusions:   Previous irradiation in patients may increase the complexity of treatment because of a greater incidence of co-existing urethral stricture disease; however, these patients are still able to achieve a level of social continence similar to that of non-irradiated patients, with no discernable increase in complication rates, cuff erosion or the need for revision surgery.

Methods:   In a population-based cost analysis, we evaluated the cost of all cancers and also those associated with breast, colorectal, lung, and prostate cancers. We obtained country-specific aggregate data for morbidity, mortality, and health-care resource use from international and national sources. We estimated health-care costs from expenditure on care in the primary, outpatient, emergency, and inpatient settings, and also drugs. Additionally, we estimated the costs of unpaid care provided by relatives or friends of patients (ie, informal care), lost earnings after premature death, and costs associated with individuals who temporarily or permanently left employment because of illness.  Findings:   Cancer cost the EU €126 billion in 2009, with health care accounting for €51·0 billion (40%). Across the EU, the health-care costs of cancer were equivalent to €102 per citizen, but varied substantially from €16 per person in Bulgaria to €184 per person in Luxembourg. Productivity losses because of early death cost €42·6 billion and lost working days €9·43 billion. Informal care cost €23·2 billion. Lung cancer had the highest economic cost (€18·8 billion, 15% of overall cancer costs), followed by breast cancer (€15·0 billion, 12%), colorectal cancer (€13·1 billion, 10%), and prostate cancer (€8·43 billion, 7%).

Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are at increased risk of certain cancers. We assessed the long-term risks of malignancies among patients with IBD in Finland. METHODS. A total of 21,964 patients with IBD (16,649 with UC and 5315 with CD) from the database of the Social Insurance Institution were diagnosed in the periods 1987-1993 and 2000-2007 and followed up to the end of 2010 in a linkage with the nationwide Finnish Cancer Registry. The numbers of cancers observed were compared to those expected in general population and expressed as a standardized incidence ratio (SIR). RESULTS. Overall, male patients with CD and UC had a slightly increased risk of malignancies. Patients with UC were found to have an increased risk of colon (SIR 1.81, 95% confidence interval 1.46-2.21), rectal (1.76, 1.35-2.25), biliary tract (7.26, 4.37-11.1), and thyroid cancers (1.93, 1.28-2.79). The risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) was highest among the youngest UC patients. Patients with CD had a significantly increased SIR for cancers of the small intestine (9.97, 4.30-19.6), anus (9.51, 1.96-27.8), and biliary tract (4.93, 1.02-14.4), and also for myeloma (2.84, 1.14-5.85). In addition, the risk of basal cell skin cancer was increased in IBD (1.29, 1.16-1.43). Males with UC had a slightly decreased risk of lung and prostate cancers. CONCLUSIONS. The incidence of cancer among male patients with CD and CU was higher than that in general population. Patients with UC are at increased risk for CRC and biliary tract cancers.

Transcription factor Slug is critical in regulating metastases of various tumors including PCa. Here we studied targeted therapy against Slug using combination of 3 drugs targeting 3 pathways respectively converging via Slug and further regulating PCa metastasis. Using in vitro assays we confirmed that Slug up-regulation incurred inhibition of E-cadherin that was anti-metastatic, and inhibited Bim-regulated cell apoptosis in PCa. Upstream PTEN/Akt, mTOR, Erk, and AR/Hsp90 pathways were responsible for Slug up-regulation and each of these could be targeted by rapamycin, CI-1040, and 17-AAG respectively. In 4 PCa cell lines with different traits in terms of PTEN loss and androgen sensitivity we tested the efficacy of mono- and combined therapy with the drugs. We found that metastatic capacity of the cells was maximally inhibited only when all 3 drugs were combined, due to the crosstalk between the pathways. 17-AAG decreases Slug expression via blockade of HSP90-dependent AR stability. Combination of rapamycin and CI-1040 diminishes invasiveness more potently in PCa cells that are androgen insensitive and with PTEN loss. Slug inhibited Bim-mediated apoptosis that could be rescued by mTOR/Erk/HSP90 inhibitors. Using mouse models for circulating PCa DNA quantification, we found that combination of mTOR/Erk/HSP90 inhibitors reduced circulating PCa cells in vivo significantly more potently than combination of 2 or monotherapy. Conclusively, combination of mTOR/Erk/Hsp90 inhibits metastatic capacity of prostate cancer via Slug inhibition.""","""['Guanxiong Ding', 'Chenchen Feng', 'Haowen Jiang', 'Qiang Ding', 'Limin Zhang', 'Rong Na', 'Hua Xu', 'Jun Liu']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Combination mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor rapamycin and HSP90 inhibitor 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin has synergistic activity in multiple myeloma.', 'Multi-drug loaded micelles delivering chemotherapy and targeted therapies directed against HSP90 and the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway in prostate cancer.', '17-ABAG, a novel geldanamycin derivative, inhibits LNCaP-cell proliferation through heat shock protein 90 inhibition.', 'Hsp90 inhibitors and drug resistance in cancer: the potential benefits of combination therapies of Hsp90 inhibitors and other anti-cancer drugs.', 'Hsp90 as a therapeutic target in prostate cancer.', 'Uncovering the potential functions of lymph node metastasis-associated aberrant methylation differentially expressed genes and their association with the immune infiltration and prognosis in bladder urothelial carcinoma.', 'Direct Targeting of the Raf-MEK-ERK Signaling Cascade Inhibits Neuroblastoma Growth.', 'The Multiple Roles and Therapeutic Potential of Molecular Chaperones in Prostate Cancer.', 'ITGB1-dependent upregulation of Caveolin-1 switches TGFβ signalling from tumour-suppressive to oncogenic in prostate cancer.', 'Small molecule inhibitor screening identifified HSP90 inhibitor 17-AAG as potential therapeutic agent for gallbladder cancer.']"""

An androgen-stimulated PAK6 kinase activation was observed in LAPC4 cells expressing endogenous PAK6 and in LNCap cells ectopically expressing a wild type PAK6. This activation was likely mediated through a direct interaction between AR and PAK6 since siRNA knock-down of AR in LAPC4 cells downregulated androgen-stimulated PAK6 activation.

The highly aggressive human fibrosarcoma HT1080 cell line harbors classical androgen receptor (AR) that responds to androgens triggering cell migration in the absence of significant mitogenesis. As occurs in many human cancer cells, HT1080 cells also express epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR).  Findings:   We report that the pure anti-androgen Casodex inhibits the growth of HT1080 cell xenografts in immune-depressed mice, revealing a novel role of AR in fibrosarcoma progression. In HT1080 cultured cells EGF, but not androgens, robustly increases DNA synthesis. Casodex abolishes the EGF mitogenic effect, implying a crosstalk between EGFR and AR. The mechanism underlying this crosstalk has been analyzed using an AR-derived small peptide, S1, which prevents AR/Src tyrosine kinase association and androgen-dependent Src activation. Present findings show that in HT1080 cells EGF induces AR/Src Association, and the S1 peptide abolishes both the assembly of this complex and Src activation. The S1 peptide inhibits EGF-stimulated DNA synthesis, cell matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) secretion and invasiveness of HT1080 cells. Both Casodex and S1 peptide also prevent DNA synthesis and migration triggered by EGF in various human cancer-derived cells (prostate, breast, colon and pancreas) that express AR.  Conclusion:   This study shows that targeting the AR domain involved in AR/Src association impairs EGF signaling in human fibrosarcoma HT1080 cells. The EGF-elicited processes inhibited by the peptide (DNA synthesis, MMP-9 secretion and invasiveness) cooperate in increasing the aggressive phenotype of HT1080 cells. Therefore, AR represents a new potential therapeutic target in human fibrosarcoma, as supported by Casodex inhibition of HT1080 cell xenografts. The extension of these findings in various human cancer-derived cell lines highlights the conservation of this process across divergent cancer cells and identifies new potential targets in the therapeutic approach to human cancers.""","""['Gabriella Castoria', 'Pia Giovannelli', 'Marzia Di Donato', 'Ryo Hayashi', 'Claudio Arra', 'Ettore Appella', 'Ferdinando Auricchio', 'Antimo Migliaccio']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Androgens Induce Invasiveness of Triple Negative Breast Cancer Cells Through AR/Src/PI3-K Complex Assembly.', 'Steroid receptor regulation of epidermal growth factor signaling through Src in breast and prostate cancer cells: steroid antagonist action.', 'Changes in androgen receptor nongenotropic signaling correlate with transition of LNCaP cells to androgen independence.', 'The development of Casodex (bicalutamide): preclinical studies.', 'Revising the role of the androgen receptor in breast cancer.', 'Agri-Food By-Products in Cancer: New Targets and Strategies.', 'Loss of the fructose transporter SLC2A5 inhibits cancer cell migration.', 'ARe we there yet?

Integrins are transmembrane receptors that bind extracellular matrix proteins and enable cell adhesion and cytoskeletal organization. They also mediate signal transduction to regulate cell proliferation and survival. The type 1 insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-IR) mediates tumor cell growth, adhesion and inhibition of apoptosis in several types of cancer. We have previously demonstrated that β1 integrins regulate anchorage-independent growth of prostate cancer (PrCa) cells by regulating IGF-IR expression and androgen receptor-mediated transcriptional functions. Furthermore, we have recently reported that IGF-IR regulates the expression of β1 integrins in PrCa cells. We have dissected the mechanism through which IGF-IR regulates β1 integrin expression in PrCa. Here we report that IGF-IR is crucial for PrCa cell growth and that β1 integrins contribute to the regulation of proliferation by IGF-IR. We demonstrate that β1 integrin regulation by IGF-IR does not occur at the mRNA level. Exogenous expression of a CD4 - β1 integrin cytoplasmic domain chimera does not interfere with such regulation and fails to stabilize β1 integrin expression in the absence of IGF-IR. This appears to be due to the lack of interaction between the β1 cytoplasmic domain and IGF-IR. We demonstrate that IGF-IR stabilizes the β1 subunit by protecting it from proteasomal degradation. The α5 subunit, one of the binding partners of β1, is also downregulated along with β1 upon IGF-IR knockdown while no change is observed in the expression of the α2, α3, α4, α6 and α7 subunits.

Our study used a coach to promote trust among minority patients with advanced cancer.  Patients and methods:   Minority patients with advanced breast, colorectal, lung, or prostate carcinoma were randomly assigned to receive a coach Intervention (CI) or usual care (UC). All patients completed baseline and 6-month telephone interviews to assess demographics, trust in health care providers, attitudes toward clinical trials, and quality of life. Patients randomly assigned to CI were assigned a coach, who made biweekly contacts for 6 months to address general issues, progress or development in cancer care, and available resources. Patients randomly assigned to UC received the standard of care, without this intervention. Clinical trial enrollment was assessed.  Results:   Over 21 months, we screened 268 patients and enrolled 73 African Americans and two Asian Americans. Patients were randomly assigned to CI (n = 38) or to UC (n = 37). Longitudinal analyses were conducted on 69 patients who completed the 6-month follow-up assessment. Trial enrollment was 16 and 13 patients for the CI and UC groups, respectively. This difference was not significant (P = .351). Higher quality of life (1-point odds ratio on Functional Assessment of Cancer Treatment-General = 1.033, P = .036) and positive attitudes toward trials predicted enrollment.

Methods:   We examined whether high PSMA protein expression in prostate tumor tissue was associated with lethal disease, and with tumor biomarkers of progression, among participants of two U.S.-based cohorts (n = 902, diagnosed 1983-2004). We used Cox proportional hazards regression to calculate multivariable HRs and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of lethal prostate cancer, defined as disease-specific death or development of distant metastases (n = 95). Partial Spearman rank correlation coefficients were used to correlate PSMA with tumor biomarkers.  Results:   During an average 13 years of follow-up, higher PSMA expression at prostatectomy was significantly associated with lethal prostate cancer (age-adjusted HRQuartile(Q)4vs.Q1 = 2.42; Ptrend < 0.01). This association was attenuated and nonsignificant (multivariable-adjusted HRQ4vs.Q1 = 1.01; Ptrend = 0.52) after further adjusting for Gleason score and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) at diagnosis. High PSMA expression was significantly (P < 0.05) correlated with higher Gleason score and PSA at diagnosis, increased tumor angiogenesis, lower vitamin D receptor and androgen receptor expression, and absence of ets-related gene (ERG) expression.  Conclusions:   High tumor PSMA expression was not an independent predictor of lethal prostate cancer in the current study. PSMA expression likely captures, in part, malignant features of Gleason grade and tumor angiogenesis.

The expression of KAI1 was found to be reduced in many types of cancers, including prostate, breast, ovarian, cervical and endometrial cancer. However, the role of KAI1 in melanoma pathogenesis is not known. In this study, we investigated the expression level of KAI1 in a large set of melanocytic lesions at different stages. We found that the expression of KAI1 is significantly decreased during melanoma progression. In fact, KAI1 expression is drastically reduced in primary melanoma compared with dysplastic nevi (P = 1.8×10(-4)) and further reduced in metastatic melanoma compared with primary melanoma (P = 9.4 × 10(-15)). Furthermore, decreased KAI1 staining is strongly correlated with a worse 5 year and 10 year patient survival. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that KAI1 is also an independent prognostic factor for both 5 year and 10 year survival. Moreover, we found that overexpression of KAI1 significantly inhibited melanoma cell migration through suppression of Rho-associated kinase-mediated formation of stress fiber. Our data also suggested that overexpression of KAI1 significantly inhibited melanoma cell invasion by reducing the activity of metalloproteinase-2. In addition, we found that suppression of melanoma cell migration by KAI1 is mediated by another tumor-suppressor protein called inhibitor of growth 4 through the regulation of p65. Taken together, our data suggest that KAI1 may be used as a promising prognostic marker and a possible therapeutic target for human melanoma.""","""['Yun Tang', 'Yabin Cheng', 'Magdalena Martinka', 'Christopher John Ong', 'Gang Li']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Carcinogenesis""","""['Role of ING4 in human melanoma cell migration, invasion and patient survival.', 'The role of the metastasis suppressor gene KAI1 in melanoma angiogenesis.', 'Prognostic significance of cytoplasmic p27 expression in human melanoma.', 'KAI1/CD82, a tumor metastasis suppressor.', 'CD82 metastasis suppressor gene: a potential target for new therapeutics?', 'A Functional Network Model of the Metastasis Suppressor PEBP1/RKIP and Its Regulators in Breast Cancer Cells.', 'Targeting CD82/KAI1 for Precision Therapeutics in Surmounting Metastatic Potential in Breast Cancer.', 'Role of Metastasis Suppressor KAI1/CD82 in Different Cancers.', 'CD82 is a marker to isolate β cell precursors from human iPS cells and plays a role for the maturation of β cells.', 'Rapamycin-upregulated miR-29b promotes mTORC1-hyperactive cell growth in TSC2-deficient cells by downregulating tumor suppressor retinoic acid receptor β (RARβ).']"""

Current treatment modalities for metastatic PCa are mostly palliative with poor prognosis. Epidemiological studies indicated that patients receiving the diabetic drug metformin have lower PCa risk and better prognosis, suggesting that metformin may have antineoplastic effects. The mechanism by which metformin acts as chemopreventive agent to impede PCa initiation and progression is unknown. The amplification of c-MYC oncogene plays a key role in early prostate epithelia cell transformation and PCa growth. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of metformin on c-myc expression and PCa progression. Our results demonstrated that (i) in Hi-Myc mice that display murine prostate neoplasia and highly resemble the progression of human prostate tumors, metformin attenuated the development of prostate intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN, the precancerous lesion of prostate) and PCa lesions. (ii) Metformin reduced c-myc protein levels in vivo and in vitro. In Myc-CaP mouse PCa cells, metformin decreased c-myc protein levels by at least 50%. (iii) Metformin selectively inhibited the growth of PCa cells by stimulating cell cycle arrest and apoptosis without affecting the growth of normal prostatic epithelial cells (RWPE-1). (iv) Reduced PIN formation by metformin was associated with reduced levels of androgen receptor and proliferation marker Ki-67 in Hi-Myc mouse prostate glands. Our novel findings suggest that by downregulating c-myc, metformin can act as a chemopreventive agent to restrict prostatic neoplasia initiation and transformation.  Summary:   Metformin, an old antidiabetes drug, may inhibit prostate intraepithelial neoplasia transforming to cancer lesion via reducing c-MYC, an 'old' overexpressed oncogene.

This study evaluated the effectiveness of a brochure for the female partners of AA men, designed to help promote such discussion on the part of their mates. We also explored the effect of the partner's monitoring style (i.e., the extent to which the partner typically attends to health threats) on promoting discussion.  Methods:   Female partners of AA men (N = 231) were randomized to receive either a prostate cancer screening Centers for Disease Control brochure for AA men, combined with a 'partner' brochure containing strategies to promote men's initiation of a provider visit to discuss screening, or the Centers for Disease Control brochure only and completed preintervention and post-intervention surveys online.  Results:   The message groups did not differ on taking active steps to engage in provider discussion: relative risk ratio (RRR) = 0.99, p = .98; thinking about it: RRR = 1.13, p = .74. However, among partners who received the partner brochure, monitoring style was associated with 'thinking about initiating a provider visit' on the part of the mate (RRR = 1.74, p < .01). Across conditions, monitoring style was also associated with 'taking active steps to initiate a provider visit' on the part of the mate (RRR = 1.38, p < .05).

However, little is known about the potential interaction between AMPK and AR signaling pathways. In the current study, we showed that activation of AMPK by metformin caused decrease of AR protein level through suppression of AR mRNA expression and promotion of AR protein degradation, demonstrating that AMPK activation is upstream of AR downregulation. We also showed that inhibition of AR function by an anti-androgen or its siRNA enhanced AMPK activation and growth inhibition whereas overexpression of AR delayed AMPK activation and increased prostate cancer cellular resistance to metformin treatment, suggesting that AR suppresses AMPK signaling-mediated growth inhibition in a feedback mechanism.

Molecular prognostic factors might differentiate indolent from aggressive tumors, allowing avoidance of unnecessary treatment.  Patients and methods:   Fifty-two prostate cancer patients (20 organ-confined and 32 metastatic) were selected. All formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded primary biopsies and matched metastases of 15 of them were evaluated for tumor and endothelial cell Id1 protein expression. Seventy-nine additional patients with organ-confined prostate cancer were selected for Id1 mRNA in silico analysis.  Results:   Among metastatic cancer subjects, 48% of primary tumors and 38% of metastases showed Id1 tumor cell expression, and 79% of primary tumors and 81% of metastases showed endothelial immunoreactivity. In the organ-confined group none of them showed Id1 protein tumor cell expression and 50% displayed endothelial expression. In the metastatic patients group, lower levels of Id1 protein predicted a nonsignificant longer overall survival (13 months vs. 7 months; P = .79). In the in silico analysis, however, lower levels of Id1 mRNA predicted a longer disease-free survival (61 months vs. not-reached; P = .018) and the hazard ratio for progression was 0.451 (P = .022) in favor of patients showing lower levels.  Conclusion:   In our cohort, it seems to be a differential epithelial expression of Id1 protein according to the prognostic features (metastatic/poor prognosis vs. organ-confined/good prognosis).

Learning curve and quality improvement was assessed by way of achieving prescription dose targets.  Materials and methods:   From May 2002 to August 2006, 100 patients underwent prostate 125I brachytherapy monotherapy via preplanned approach. Preoperative planned dose to 100% of prostate gland (D100) was 145 Gy and postoperative confirmed dose was assessed by computed tomography. The cohort was divided into quartiles and recurrence was assessed using Kaplan-Meier analysis.  Results:   Patient quartiles were of similar age and Gleason grade, while PSA was slightly higher in the first group. Postoperative D90 increased after the first quartile (p = < 0.0001) reaching targeted values. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed that 5 year recurrence-free survivals by Phoenix definition was 96%-100% in all groups while by ASTRO definition there was a decrease in recurrence for later cases.  Conclusions:   At our low volume institution during the first 100 brachytherapy cases, a learning curve for radiation dosimetry was evident, which improved after 25 patients. Preplanned dose-volume parameters were adjusted, enabling the achievement of post-implant goals emphasizing the importance of continuous quality improvement. Although recurrence data is limited by sample size and moderate follow up, there was a discrepancy between the Phoenix and ASTRO definition when evaluating recurrence.""","""['Nathan A Bockholt', 'Eric M DeRoo', 'Kenneth G Nepple', 'Joseph M Modrick', 'Mark C Smith', 'Bernard Fallon', 'A Curtis Hass', 'Chad R Tracy', 'James A Brown']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Can J Urol""","""['The path to quality prostate seed implants.', 'Long term results of a prospective dose escalation phase-II trial: interstitial pulsed-dose-rate brachytherapy as boost for intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer.', 'Validation and comparison of the two Kattan nomograms in patients with prostate cancer treated with (125) iodine brachytherapy.', 'Three-year results of treatment for prostate cancer with low-dose rate temporary iridium-192 brachytherapy.', 'The correlation between D90 and outcome for I-125 seed implant monotherapy for localised prostate cancer.', ""High-dose-rate intensity-modulated brachytherapy with external beam radiotherapy for prostate cancer: California endocurietherapy's 10-year results."", 'Characterizing Surgical and Radiotherapy Outcomes in Non-metastatic High-Risk Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'Institutional patient accrual volume and the treatment quality of I‑125 prostate seed implantation in a\xa0Japanese nationwide prospective cohort study.']"""

Consequently, tumors originating from the anterior apical region and transition zones may be under-sampled. We examined whether addition of transrectal anterior biopsy (TAB) would improve efficacy of prostate biopsies.  Materials and methods:   Simulations of TAB and sextant biopsy (SB) were performed using computer models of 86 autopsy prostates (AP) and 40 radical prostatectomy (RP) specimens. TAB was obtained bilaterally from apex, mid, and base regions by advancing the biopsy needle 5 mm-35 mm beyond the prostatic capsule. A phase I clinical trial with 114 patients was conducted to determine the performance of an extended biopsy protocol consisting of TAB, SB, and laterally-directed biopsy (LDB).  Results:   The overall cancer detection rates of SB and TAB were 33% and 55% for AP series (p = 0.00003); 60% and 88% for RP series (p = 0.006). Alternatively, SB + bilateral apical TAB and SB + bilateral mid TAB had cancer detection rates of 45% and 42% for AP series; 80% and 78% for RP series. The extended biopsy protocol detected cancer in 33% (38/114) of patients with 29, 25, and 15 diagnosed by SB, LDB, and bilateral apical TAB, respectively. Patients diagnosed by bilateral apical TAB versus SB (p = 0.01) and LDB (p = 0.02) were statistically significant. Without bilateral apical TAB, the overall cancer detection rate decreased to 30% (34/114).  Conclusions:   Inclusion of bilateral TAB from apical region for first time and repeat prostate biopsies may increase diagnosis of prostate cancer. The clinical significance of these findings needs further investigations and clinical follow up.""","""['Priya N Werahera', 'E David Crawford', 'Francisco G La Rosa', 'Kathleen C Torkko', 'Beth Schulte', 'Holly T Sullivan', 'Adrie van Bokhoven', 'M Scott Lucia', 'Fernando J Kim']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Can J Urol""","""['Extended prostate biopsy scheme improves reliability of Gleason grading: implications for radiotherapy patients.', 'The utility of apical anterior horn biopsies in prostate cancer detection.', 'Impact of extended prostate biopsy including apical anterior region for cancer detection and prediction of surgical margin status for radical prostatectomy.', 'Optimization of initial prostate biopsy in clinical practice: sampling, labeling and specimen processing.', 'Extended and saturation prostatic biopsy in the diagnosis and characterisation of prostate cancer: a critical analysis of the literature.', 'Clinical outcomes of anterior prostate cancers treated with robotic assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Prostate zones and cancer: lost in transition?', 'Circulating blood miRNAs for prostate cancer risk stratification: miRroring the underlying tumor biology with liquid biopsies.', 'The characteristics and spatial distributions of initially missed and rebiopsy-detected prostate cancers.', 'Focal Cryotherapy in Low-Risk Prostate Cancer: Are We Treating the Cancer or the Mind? - The Cancer.']"""

Material and methods:   All patients had already been selected for prostate radiotherapy on TomoTherapy, with daily MV-CT imaging. The study involved performing an additional MV-CT image at the end of treatment, on 5 occasions during the course of 37 treatments. 54 patients were recruited to the study. A new formula was derived to calculate the PTV margin for intra-fraction motion.  Results:   The mean values of the intra-fraction differences were 0.0mm, 0.5mm, 0.5mm and 0.0° for LR, SI, AP and roll, respectively. The corresponding standard deviations were 1.1mm, 0.8mm, 0.8mm and 0.6° for systematic uncertainties (Σ), 1.3mm, 2.0mm, 2.2mm and 0.3° for random uncertainties (σ). This intra-fraction motion requires margins of 2.2mm in LR, 2.1mm in SI and 2.1mm in AP directions. Inclusion of estimates of the effect of rotations and matching errors increases these margins to approximately 4mm in LR and 5mm in SI and AP directions.

Methods:   Patients hospitalized from January 2000 to December 2010 with a diagnosis of malignant neoplasm (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, codes 140-208.91) were included. Diabetes mellitus was defined as a fasting blood glucose of 126 mg/dL or greater or a postprandial blood glucose of 200 mg/dL or greater. The patients were categorized according to BMI criteria for Asians: normal weight, BMI of less than 24 kg/m; overweight, BMI of greater than 24 kg/m; and obese, BMI of greater than 27 kg/m.  Results:   A total of 42,229 patients were included, of which 24,884 (59%) were normal weight, 10,096 (24%) were overweight, and 7,249 (17%) were obese. There were 4,195 (16.9%), 2,056 (20.4%), and 1,625 (22.4%) patients with DM in the normal weight, overweight, and obese groups, respectively. Regardless of weight, the diabetic patients were more likely to have pancreas, liver, urinary tract, prostate, skin, hematological, lung, secondary, and gastric malignancies but were less likely to have cervical, oropharyngeal, nasopharyngeal, breast, or thyroid cancer. Regardless of sex or the presence or the absence of DM, the patients with more than 1 malignancy were more likely to die than were those with only 1 malignancy. Furthermore, the obese diabetic patients had higher mortality than did the obese nondiabetic patients with the same number of cancers.

Since the introduction of the prostate specific antigen (PSA) measurements, few men have metastatic disease at the time diagnosis. More than half of prostate cancer patients are currently being diagnosed with low-volume localised prostate cancer. This raises the question whether all of these men should be treated, especially when prostate cancer-specific mortality is low compared to overall mortality even in men without known comorbidity at the time of diagnosis. In recent series of such 'healthy' men treated for localised prostate cancer, the overall mortality exceeded prostate cancer mortality four to five-fold. Both tumour-related factors and general health status affect the outcome of prostate cancer treatment. In 'healthy' men with a low-volume, low-risk tumour, initial active surveillance is preferred above actual treatment. The small chance of progression and the possibility of curative treatment at the time of progression should be communicated to the patient.

This article evaluates the time for daily online imaging with TomoTherapy® (Accuray®, Sunnyvale, CA), separating mechanical scan acquisition from radiographer-led image matching, to estimate the time required for a clinical research study (VoxTox).  Methods:   Over 5 years, 18 533 treatments were recorded for 3 tumour sites of interest (prostate, head and neck and central nervous system). Data were collected for scan length, number of CT slices, slice thickness, scan acquisition time and image matching time.  Results:   The proportion of coarse thickness scans increased over time, with a move of making coarse scans as the default. There was a strong correlation between scan time and scan length. Scan acquisition requires 40 s of processing time. For coarse scans, each additional centimetre requires 8 s for acquisition. Image matching takes approximately 1.5 times as long, so each additional centimetre needs 20 s extra in total. Modest changes to the imaging protocol have minimal impact over the course of the day.  Conclusion:   This work quantified the effect of changes to clinical protocols required for research. The results have been found to be reassuring in the busy National Institutes of Health department.  Advances in knowledge:   This novel method of data collection and analysis provides evidence of the minimal impact of research on clinical turnover.

Patients and methods:   This retrospective study analysed 1024 patients who consecutively underwent a four-core real-time elastography (RTE) targeted biopsies in addition to a randomized 10-core transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS)-guided biopsy in a primary or rebiopsy setting. The overall DR, the DR of a 10-core randomized, RTE targeted biopsy and the incremental DR were calculated.  Results:   Overall, randomized and RTE targeted biopsy DRs (for the combination, the 10-core and the four-core RTE biopsy scheme) were 46.2% (n = 473), 39.1% (n = 400) and 29.0% (n = 297), respectively. Four-core RTE targeted biopsies detected an additional 73 patients not detected by the 10-core randomized biopsies (increase in the overall DR of 7.1%). This represented a relative increase in DR of 18.3%. The incremental DR was better in rebiopsy patients (24.8%) than in patients having their first biopsy (14.7%). Within all patients diagnosed by RTE targeted biopsy only, 34 patients harboured significant Gleason 4 or 5 prostate cancer (PCa), diagnosed by four-core RTE biopsy only. Moreover, PCa with a Gleason grade of 4 or 5 was detected by four-core RTE biopsies in 30 patients, who showed low-grade PCa ≤ Gleason 3 only in the systematic 10-core biopsy.  Conclusions:   Real-time elastography targeted biopsy seems to be an appropriate method for increasing the DR of PCa.

Independent and multivariate models were constructed to predict the likelihood of PSMs. Independent and multivariate predictors of secondary treatment after RP in the initial 12 months after diagnosis were also assessed.  Results:   Data on PSM status were collected for 2219/2385 (93%) patients.

Patients having surgery in a hospital where <10 RPs occur each year were significantly more likely to have a PSM (incidence rate ratio [IRR] 1.44, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.07-1.93) and those in the intermediate-, high- or very-high-risk groups (IRR 1.34, 95% CI 1.09-1.65, P = 0.007, IRR 1.96, 95% CI 1.57-2.45, P < 0.001 and IRR 3.81, 95% CI 2.60-5.60, P < 0.001, respectively) were significantly more likely to have a PSM than those in the low-risk group (IRR 2.50, 95% CI 1.23-5.11, P = 0.012). Patients with PSMs were significantly less likely to have been treated at a private hospital than a public hospital (IRR 0.76, 95% CI 0.63-0.93, P = 0.006) or to have undergone robot-assisted RP (IRR 0.69, 95% CI 0.55-0.87; P = 0.002) than open RP. Of the 2182 patients who underwent RP in the initial 12 months after diagnosis, 1987 (91.1%) received no subsequent treatment, 123 (5.6%) received radiotherapy, 47 (2.1%) received androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and 23 (1.1%) received a combination of radiotherapy and ADT. Two patients (0.1%) received chemotherapy combined with another treatment. At a multivariate level, predictors of additional treatment after RP in the initial 12 months included having a PSM compared with a negative surgical margin (odds ratio [OR] 5.61, 95% CI 3.82-8.22, P < 0.001); pT3 compared with pT2 disease (OR 4.72, 95% CI 2.69-8.23, P < 0.001); and having high- or very-high-risk disease compared with low-risk disease (OR 4.36, 95% CI 2.24-8.50, P < 0.001 and OR 4.50, 95% CI 1.34-15.17, P = 0.015, respectively). Patient age, hospital location and hospital type were not associated with secondary treatment. Patients undergoing robot-assisted RP were significantly less likely to receive additional treatment than those receiving open RP (OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.39-0.88, P = 0.010).  Conclusions:   These data indicate an important association between hospital status and PSMs, with patients who underwent RP in private hospitals less likely than those in public hospitals to have a PSM. Patients treated in lower-volume hospitals were more likely to have a PSM and less likely to receive additional treatment after surgery in the initial 12 months, and robot-assisted RP was associated with fewer PSMs than was open RP in this non-randomized observational study. PSM status and pathological T3 disease are both important and independent predictors of secondary cancer treatment for patients undergoing RP.

Participants were evaluated at 3, 6 and 12 months after surgery with the IIEF-5 questionnaire and questions regarding urinary bother. Patients using up to one pad daily for security reasons only were considered continent. The study was registered at http://clinicaltrials.gov/ (NCT01067261).  Results:   Data from 68 patients were available for analyses (30 patients randomized to PVS and 38 patients randomized to the control group). The IIEF-5 score was highest in the PVS group at all time points after surgery with a median score of 18 vs 7.5 in the control group at 12 months (P = 0.09), but the difference only reached borderline significance. At 12 months, 16/30 (53%) patients in the PVS group had reached an IIEF-5 score of at least 18, while this was the case for 12/38 (32%) patients in the control group (P = 0.07). There were no significant differences in the proportions of continent patients between groups at 3, 6 or 12 months. At 12 months 90% of the PVS patients were continent, while 94.7% of the control patients were continent (P = 0.46).  Conclusion:   The present study did not document a significant effect of PVS. However, the method proved to be acceptable for most patients and there was a trend towards better erectile function with PVS. More studies are needed to explore this possible effect further.""","""['Mikkel Fode', 'Michael Borre', 'Dana A Ohl', 'Jonas Lichtbach', 'Jens Sønksen']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Penile vibratory stimulation: a novel approach for penile rehabilitation after nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy.', 'Effects of tadalafil treatment on erectile function recovery following bilateral nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy: a randomised placebo-controlled study (REACTT).', 'The role of waterjet dissection in improving erectile function and continence after nerve-sparing prostatectomy.', 'Nerve-sparing approach during radical prostatectomy is strongly associated with the rate of postoperative urinary continence recovery.', 'Exploratory Decision-Tree Modeling of Data from the Randomized REACTT Trial of Tadalafil Versus Placebo to Predict Recovery of Erectile Function After Bilateral Nerve-Sparing Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Preservation of the neurovascular bundles is associated with improved time to continence after radical prostatectomy but not long-term continence rates: results of a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Restorative therapy clinical trials for erectile dysfunction: a scoping review of endpoint measures.', 'Penile Rehabilitation and Treatment Options for Erectile Dysfunction Following Radical Prostatectomy and Radiotherapy: A Systematic Review.', ""Alternative Treatment for Erectile Dysfunction: a Growing Arsenal in Men's Health."", 'Genital vibration for sexual function and enhancement: a review of evidence.', 'Current management strategy of treating patients with erectile dysfunction after radical prostatectomy: a systematic review and meta-analysis.']"""

Cancer cells exploit these chaperones by maintaining the stability of mutated and misfolded oncoproteins and allowing them to evade proteosomal degradation. Inhibiting Hsp90 is an attractive strategy for cancer therapy, as the concomitant degradation of multiple oncoproteins may lead to effective anti-neoplastic agents. Unfortunately, early clinical trials have been disappointing with N-terminal Hsp90 inhibitors, as it is unclear whether the problems that plague current Hsp90 inhibitors in clinical trials are related to on-target or off-target activity. One approach to overcome these pitfalls is to identify structurally diverse scaffolds that improve Hsp90 inhibitory activity in the cancer cell milieu. Utilizing a panel of cancer cell lines that express luciferase, we have designed an in-cell Hsp90-dependent luciferase refolding assay. The assay was optimized using previously identified Hsp90 inhibitors and experimental novobiocin analogues against prostate, colon, and lung cancer cell lines. This assay exhibits good interplate precision (% CV), a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of ≥7, and an approximate Z-factor ranging from 0.5 to 0.7. Novobiocin analogues that revealed activity in this assay were examined via western blot experiments for client protein degradation, a hallmark of Hsp90 inhibition. Subsequently, a pilot screen was conducted using the Prestwick library, and two compounds, biperiden and ethoxyquin, revealed significant activity. Here, we report the development of an in-cell Hsp90-dependent luciferase refolding assay that is amenable across cancer cell lines for the screening of inhibitors in their specific milieu.""","""['Takrima Sadikot', 'Megan Swink', 'Jeffery D Eskew', 'Douglas Brown', 'Huiping Zhao', 'Bhaskar R Kusuma', 'Roger A Rajewski', 'Brian S J Blagg', 'Robert L Matts', 'Jeffrey M Holzbeierlein', 'George A Vielhauer']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Assay Drug Dev Technol""","""['KU675, a Concomitant Heat-Shock Protein Inhibitor of Hsp90 and Hsc70 that Manifests Isoform Selectivity for Hsp90α in Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Novobiocin and additional inhibitors of the Hsp90 C-terminal nucleotide-binding pocket.', 'Hsp90 inhibitors identified from a library of novobiocin analogues.', 'Synthesis and Biological Evaluation of Novobiocin Core Analogues as Hsp90 Inhibitors.', 'Development of small molecule Hsp90 inhibitors: utilizing both forward and reverse chemical genomics for drug identification.', 'Discovery of Quinacrine as a Potent Topo II and Hsp90 Dual-Target Inhibitor, Repurposing for Cancer Therapy.', 'In Silico Discovery and Optimisation of a Novel Structural Class of Hsp90 C-Terminal Domain Inhibitors.', 'Assay design and development strategies for finding Hsp90 inhibitors and their role in human diseases.', 'Discovery of Novel Hsp90 C-Terminal Inhibitors Using 3D-Pharmacophores Derived from Molecular Dynamics Simulations.', 'Repurposing metformin, simvastatin and digoxin as a combination for targeted therapy for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.']"""

Recent clinical studies have demonstrated that tissue inhibitor matrix metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) levels are elevated in cancer patient plasma and elevated TIMP-1 levels are associated with worse clinical outcomes. However, it is unknown whether TIMP-1 serves merely as a biomarker of cancer progression or has a functional role in promoting cancer progression and can serve as a cancer therapeutic target, which is the main objective of this study. Here, we show that stroma of human prostate and colon cancer express higher levels of TIMP-1 compared to their normal counterparts and increased expression of TIMP-1 promotes in vivo growth of both cancer types. We demonstrate for the first time that increased TIMP-1 expression stimulates accumulation of cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) within prostate and colon cancer tissues and that TIMP-1 enhances prostate CAF proliferation and migration in vitro and promotes ERK1/2 kinase activation in these CAF cells. Our results establish the novel promotive effects of TIMP-1 on cancer progression and on accumulation of CAFs that in turn provides a pro-tumor microenvironment.

In the absence of somatic mutations in CAF, epigenetic changes dictate how stromal coevolution is mediated in tumors. Seventy percent of prostate cancer patients lose expression of transforming growth factor-beta type II receptor (TGFBR2) in the stromal compartment (n=77, P-value=0.0001), similar to the rate of glutathione S-transferase P1 (GSTP1) silencing. Xenografting of human prostate cancer epithelia, LNCaP, resulted in the epigenetic Tgfbr2 silencing of host mouse prostatic fibroblasts. Stromal Tgfbr2 promoter hypermethylation, initiated by LNCaP cells, was found to be dependent on interleukin 6 expression, based on neutralizing antibody studies. We further found that pharmacologic and transgenic knockout of TGF-β responsiveness in prostatic fibroblasts induced Gstp1 promoter methylation. It is known that TGF-β promotes DNA stability, however, the mechanism is not well understood. Both prostatic human CAF and mouse transgenic knockout of Tgbr2 had elevated DNA methyltransferase I (DNMT1) activity and histone H3 lysine 9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) to suggest greater promoter methylation. Interestingly, the conditional knockout of Tgfbr2 in mouse prostatic fibroblasts, in modeling epigenetic silencing of Tgfbr2, had greater epigenetic gene silencing of multiple DNA damage repair and oxidative stress response genes, based on promoter methylation array analysis. Homologous gene silencing was validated by reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR in mouse and human prostatic CAF. Not surprisingly, DNA damage repair gene silencing in the prostatic stromal cells corresponded with the presence of DNA damage. Restoring the expression of the epigenetically silenced genes in wild-type fibroblasts with radiation-induced DNA damage reduced tumor progression. Tumor progression was inhibited even when epigenetic silencing was reversed in the Tgfbr2-knockout prostatic fibroblasts. Taken together, fibroblastic epigenetic changes causative of DNA damage, initiated by association with cancer epithelia, is a dominant mediator of tumor progression over TGF-β responsiveness.""","""['J Banerjee', 'R Mishra', 'X Li', 'R S Jackson nd', 'A Sharma', 'N A Bhowmick']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['Stromal transforming growth factor-beta signaling mediates prostatic response to androgen ablation by paracrine Wnt activity.', 'Loss of TGF-β responsiveness in prostate stromal cells alters chemokine levels and facilitates the development of mixed osteoblastic/osteolytic bone lesions.', 'Epithelial Hic-5/ARA55 expression contributes to prostate tumorigenesis and castrate responsiveness.', 'Gene methylation in gastric cancer.', 'Glutathione S-transferase pi (GSTP1) hypermethylation in prostate cancer: review 2007.', 'Epigenetic regulation of cancer-associated fibroblast heterogeneity.', 'TGF-β controls stromal telomere length through epigenetic modifications.', 'Antagonizing CD105 and androgen receptor to target stromal-epithelial interactions for clinical benefit.', 'Differential enrichment of H3K9me3 in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.', 'Fatty Acid Signaling Impacts Prostate Cancer Lineage Plasticity in an Autocrine and Paracrine Manner.']"""

Hypoxia arises in tumor regions distal to blood vessels as oxygen is consumed by more proximal tumor cells. Reducing the rate of oxygen consumption is therefore a potential strategy to reduce tumor hypoxia. We hypothesized that the anti-diabetic drug metformin, which reduces oxygen consumption through inhibition of mitochondrial complex I, would improve radiation response by increasing tumor oxygenation.  Experimental design:   Tumor hypoxia was measured in xenografts before and after metformin treatment using 2-nitroimidazole hypoxia markers quantified by immunohistochemistry (IHC), flow cytometry, and positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. Radiation response was determined by tumor growth delay and clonogenic survival in xenografts with and without administration of metformin. The impact of metformin use on outcome was assessed in 504 patients with localized prostate cancer treated with curative-intent, image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT) from 1996 to 2012. Three-year biochemical relapse-free rates were assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method.  Results:   Metformin treatment significantly improved tumor oxygenation in two xenograft models as measured by IHC, flow cytometry, and PET imaging. Metformin also led to improved radiotherapy responses when mice were administered metformin immediately before irradiation. Clinically, metformin use was associated with an independent and significant decrease in early biochemical relapse rates (P = 0.0106).

In this study, we employed human neural stem cells (HB1.F3; hNSCs) transduced with genes expressing Escherichia coli cytosine deaminase (HB1.F3.CD) and human interferon-beta (HB1.F3.CD.IFN-β) as a treatment strategy for ductal breast cancer. CD can convert the prodrug 5-fluorocytosine (5-FC) to its active chemotherapeutic form, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), which induces a tumor-killing effect through DNA synthesis inhibition. IFN-β also strongly inhibits tumor growth by the apoptotic process. RT-PCR confirmed that HB1.F3.CD cells expressed CD and HB1.F3.CD.IFN-β cells expressed both CD and IFN-β. A modified transwell migration assay showed that HB1.F3.CD and HB1.F3.CD.IFN-β cells selectively migrated toward MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells. In hNSC-breast cancer co-cultures the viability of breast cancer cells which were significantly reduced by HB1.F3.CD or HB1.F3.CD.IFN-β cells in the presence of 5-FC. The tumor inhibitory effect was greater with the HB1.F3.CD.IFN-β cells, indicating an additional effect of IFN-β to 5-FU. In addition, the tumor-tropic properties of these hNSCs were found to be attributed to chemoattractant molecules secreted by breast cancer cells, including stem cell factor (SCF), c-kit, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and VEGF receptor 2. An in vivo assay performed using MDA-MB-231/luc breast cancer mammary fat pad xenografts in immunodeficient mice resulted in 50% reduced tumor growth and increased long-term survival in HB1.F3.CD and HB1.F3.CD.IFN-β plus 5-FC treated mice relative to controls.

Eight prostate cancer patients, treated with 7-9, 6 MV, intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) fields, were included in this study. The workflow consists of cone beam CT (CBCT) based localization, deformable image registration of the CBCT to simulation CT image datasets (SIM-CT), dose reconstruction and dose accumulation on the SIM-CT, and plan evaluation using radiobiological models. For each patient, three IMRT plans were generated with different margins applied to the CTV. The PTV margin for the original plan was 10 mm and 6 mm at the prostate/anterior rectal wall interface (10/6 mm) and was reduced to: (a) 5/3 mm, and (b) 3 mm uniformly. The average percent reductions in predicted tumor control probability (TCP) in the accumulated (actual) plans in comparison to the original plans over eight patients were 0.4%, 0.7% and 11.0% with 10/6 mm, 5/3 mm and 3 mm uniform margin respectively. The mean increase in predicted normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) for grades 2/3 rectal bleeding for the actual plans in comparison to the static plans with margins of 10/6, 5/3 and 3 mm uniformly was 3.5%, 2.8% and 2.4% respectively. For the actual dose distributions, predicted NTCP for late rectal bleeding was reduced by 3.6% on average when the margin was reduced from 10/6 mm to 5/3 mm, and further reduced by 1.0% on average when the margin was reduced to 3 mm. The average reduction in complication free tumor control probability (P+) in the actual plans in comparison to the original plans with margins of 10/6, 5/3 and 3 mm was 3.7%, 2.4% and 13.6% correspondingly. The significant reduction of TCP and P+ in the actual plan with 3 mm margin came from one outlier, where individualizing patient treatment plans through margin adaptation based on biological models, might yield higher quality treatments.""","""['Ning Wen', 'Akila Kumarasiri', 'Teamour Nurushev', 'Jay Burmeister', 'Lei Xing', 'Dezhi Liu', 'Carri Glide-Hurst', 'Jinkoo Kim', 'Hualiang Zhong', 'Benjamin Movsas', 'Indrin J Chetty']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Determination of optimal PTV margin for patients receiving CBCT-guided prostate IMRT: comparative analysis based on CBCT dose calculation with four different margins.', 'Evaluation of online/offline image guidance/adaptation approaches for prostate cancer radiation therapy.', 'Dosimetric Evaluation of Incorporating Patient Geometric Variations Into Adaptive Plan Optimization Through Probabilistic Treatment Planning in Head and Neck Cancers.', 'Radiotherapy of prostate cancer with or without intensity modulated beams: a planning comparison.', 'Adaptive Radiation Therapy in the Treatment of Lung Cancer: An Overview of the Current State of the Field.', 'Quantifying 6D tumor motion and calculating PTV margins during liver stereotactic radiotherapy with fiducial tracking.', 'Dosimetric advantages of daily adaptive strategy in IMPT for high-risk prostate cancer.', 'Spatial and dosimetric evaluation of residual distortions of prostate and seminal vesicle bed after image-guided definitive and postoperative radiotherapy of prostate cancer with endorectal balloon.', 'Study of Asymmetric Margins in Prostate Cancer Radiation Therapy Using Fuzzy Logic.', 'Modeling of Acute Rectal Toxicity to Compare Two Patient Positioning Methods for Prostate Cancer Radiotherapy: Can Toxicity Modeling be Used for Quality Assurance?']"""

While effective mechanical and chemoprophylaxis exists, such prophylaxis may also be associated with increased complications. To identify venous thromboembolic event risk factors and, thereby, facilitate targeted prophylaxis we characterized clinicopathological variables associated with these events in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy.  Materials and methods:   We reviewed the records of 18,472 consecutive patients who underwent radical prostatectomy with pelvic lymphadenectomy for prostate cancer at our institution from 1987 to 2010. Patients were followed postoperatively for complications. Venous thromboembolic events within 30 days of surgery were recorded. Logistic regression models were used to analyze clinicopathological variables associated with venous thromboembolic events.  Results:   We identified symptomatic venous thromboembolic events in 271 patients (1.4%). This diagnosis was not associated with preoperative body mass index, prostate specific antigen, Gleason score or cancer recurrence. However, the diagnosis was significantly associated with nonO blood type (OR 1.98, p = 0.004), an increasing number of lymph nodes removed (OR 1.05, p = 0.035) and blood transfusion (OR 1.30, p = 0.02). Patients with venous thromboembolic events were significantly more likely to die within 30 days of surgery (3.0% vs 0%, p <0.001).  Conclusions:   Blood type, pelvic lymphadenectomy extent and blood transfusion are significant risk factors for symptomatic venous thromboembolic event before radical prostatectomy plus pelvic lymph node dissection. These data should be used for patient counseling, particularly in regard to obviating lymphadenectomy in patients at low risk and for individualizing prophylaxis for venous thromboembolic event in patients at higher risk.""","""['Matthew K Tollefson', 'R Jeffrey Karnes', 'Laureano Rangel', 'Rachel Carlson', 'Stephen A Boorjian']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Extended pelvic lymphadenectomy in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy: high incidence of lymph node metastasis.', 'Complications of pelvic lymphadenectomy in 1,380 patients undergoing radical retropubic prostatectomy between 1993 and 2006.', 'Standardized comparison of robot-assisted limited and extended pelvic lymphadenectomy for prostate cancer.', 'Pharmacological prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism in contemporary radical retropubic prostatectomy: does concomitant pelvic lymphadenectomy matter?', 'Anatomical extent of pelvic lymphadenectomy in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy.', 'The Impact of ABO Blood Type on Developing Venous Thromboembolism in Cancer Patients: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'Surgical management of high-risk, localized prostate cancer.', 'Validating the role of ABO blood type in risk of perioperative venous thromboembolism after radical cystectomy.', 'Perioperative Blood Transfusion as a Significant Predictor of Biochemical Recurrence and Survival after Radical Prostatectomy in Patients with Prostate Cancer.', 'Platelet transfusion - the new immunology of an old therapy.']"""

The signal produced by the emitted photons from the chemiluminescent substrate (4-methoxy-4-(3-phosphatephenyl)-spiro-(1,2-dioxetane-3,2'-adamantane)) is directly proportional to the amount of f-PSA in a sample. The present MMP-based assay can detect f-PSA in the range of 0.1-30 ng mL(-1) with the detection limit of 0.1 ng mL(-1). The linear detection range could match the concentration range within the ""diagnostic gray zone"" of serum f-PSA levels (4-10 ng mL(-1)). The detection limit was sufficient for measuring clinically relevant f-PSA levels (>4 ng mL(-1)). Furthermore, the method was highly selective; it was unaffected by cross-reaction with human glandular kallikrein-2, a kallikrein-like serine protease that is 80% similar to f-PSA. The proposed method was finally applied to determine f-PSA in 40 samples of human sera. Results obtained using the method showed high correlation with those obtained using a commercially available microplate CLEIA kit (correlation coefficient, 0.9821).

However, the role of ZFX in human osteosarcoma remains unknown. Here we investigated the phenotype of ZFX knockdown on cell proliferation and in vitro tumorigenesis using lentivirus-mediated loss-of-function strategy. The results demonstrated that the proliferation and colony formation ability of human osteosarcoma Saos-2 and MG63 cells was impaired by ZFX small interfering RNA (siRNA)-expressing lentivirus. Moreover, loss of ZFX led to G0/G1 phase cell cycle arrest and a significant increase of cells in the sub-G1 fraction, indicating that ZFX functions as an oncogene in the malignant proliferation process in osteosarcoma. Furthermore, ZFX siRNA may have an antitumorigenic effect on osteosarcoma cells.

Serum PSA levels were determined at each examination for both cohorts and observations after a diagnosis of prostate cancer or treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia were censored. The observed and estimated annual percentage of change in the serum PSA levels were examined by race.  Results:   At baseline, the median PSA level in the white men did not differ from the median level observed in the African American men (white men 0.9 ng/mL; African American men 0.9 ng/mL; P = .48).

Methods and materials:   Monte Carlo methods for radiation transport were used to estimate the dosimetric influence of brachytherapy end-weld thicknesses and spacers near the three sources. Single-source assessments and volumetric conditions simulating prior patient treatments were computed. Volume-dose distributions were imported to a treatment planning system for dose-volume histogram analyses.  Results:   Single-source assessment revealed that brachytherapy spacers primarily attenuated the dose distribution along the source long axis. The magnitude of the attenuation at 1 cm on the long axis ranged from -10% to -5% for conventional spacers and approximately -2% for C4 spacers, with the largest attenuation for (103)Pd. Spacer perturbation of dose distributions was less than manufacturing tolerances for brachytherapy sources as gleaned by an analysis of end-weld thicknesses. Volumetric Monte Carlo assessment demonstrated that TG-43 techniques overestimated calculated doses by approximately 2%.

Method:   Sixty-two patients with CRP were included in this retrospective study. Patients underwent pelvic irradiation due to prostate cancer (n = 28), cervical cancer (n = 16), endometrial cancer (n = 17) or rectal cancer (n = 1). APC was performed in all patients. Control endoscopies were performed at 8 and 16 weeks after enrolment.  Results:   Rectal ulcers were observed after APC in 35 (56%) patients. They were symptomatic in 5 and asymptomatic in 30. The 20 (32%) patients who were on antiplatelet therapy had a significantly lower risk of ulceration after APC (OR = 0.21; 95% CI 0.049-0.91; P = 0.019). The number of symptomatic ulcers (5% vs 10%; P = 1.0) and asymptomatic ulcers alone (30% vs 58%; P = 0.06) was also lower in patients respectively taking and not taking antiplatelet therapy, but these differences did not reach statistical significance.

In this paper, we evaluated, for the first time, the therapeutic benefit of blocking EGRF and/or COX-2 (using gefitinib and NS-398, respectively) in terms of improving the efficacy of the conventional clinical chemotherapeutic drug docetaxel in vitro and vivo. We showed that EGFR and COX-2 expression was higher in metastatic than non-metastatic PCa tissues and cells. Docetaxel, alone or in combination with gefitinib or NS-398, resulted in a small decrease in cell viability. The three drug combination decreased cell viability to a greater extent than docetaxel alone or in combination with gefitinib or NS-398. Docetaxel resulted in a modest increase in apoptotic cell in metastatic and non-metastatic cell lines. NS-398 markedly enhanced docetaxel-induced cell apoptosis. The combination of the three drugs caused even more marked apoptosis and resulted in greater suppression of invasive potential than docetaxel alone or in association with gefitinib or NS-398. The combination of all three drugs also resulted in a more marked decrease in NF-ΚB, MMP-9 and VEGF levels in PC-3M cells. These in vitro findings were supported by in vivo studies showing that docetaxel in combination with gefitinib and NS-398 was significantly more effective than any individual agent.

TICs are commonly isolated by cell sorting or dye exclusion, however, isolating TICs from limited primary prostate cancer (PCa) tissues is inherently inefficient. We adapted the collagen adherence feature to develop a combined immunophenotypic and time-of-adherence assay to identify human prostate TICs.  Methods:   PCa cells from multiple cell lines and primary tissues were allowed to adhere to several matrix molecules, and fractions of adherent cells were examined for their TIC properties.  Results:   Collagen I rapidly-adherent PCa cells have significantly higher clonogenic, migration, and invasion abilities, and initiated more tumor xenografts in mice when compared to slowly-adherent and no-adherent cells. To determine the relative frequency of TICs among PCa cell lines and primary PCa cells, we utilized zebrafish xenografts to define the tumor initiation potential of serial dilutions of rapidly-adherent α2β1(hi) /CD44(hi) cells compared to non-adherent cells with α2β1(low) /CD44(low) phenotype. Tumor initiation from rapidly-adherent α2β1(hi) /CD44(hi) TICs harboring the TMPRSS2:ERG fusion generated xenografts comprising of PCa cells expressing Erg, AMACR, and PSA. Moreover, PCa-cell dissemination was consistently observed in the immune-permissive zebrafish microenvironment from as-few-as 3 rapidly-adherent α2β1(hi) /CD44(hi) cells. In zebrafish xenografts, self-renewing prostate TICs comprise 0.02-0.9% of PC3 cells, 0.3-1.3% of DU145 cells, and 0.22-14.3% of primary prostate adenocarcinomas.  Conclusion:   Zebrafish PCa xenografts were used to determine that the frequency of prostate TICs varies among PCa cell lines and primary PCa tissues.

Therefore, in this study, we explored the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and identified featured genes related to hormone stimulus from PC. Two sets of gene expression data, including PC and normal control sample, were downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. The t-test was used to identify DEGs between PC and controls. Gene ontology (GO) functional annotation was applied to analyze the function of DEGs and screen hormone-related DEGs. Then these hormone-related DEGs were further analyzed in constructed cancer network and Human Protein Reference Database to screen important signaling pathways they participated in. A total of 912 DEGs were obtained which included 326 up-regulated genes and 586 down-regulated genes. GO functional enrichment analysis identified 50 hormone-related DEGs associated with PC. After pathway and PPI network analysis, we found these hormone-related DEGs participated in several important signaling pathways including TGF-β (TGFB2, TGFB3 and TGFBR2), MAPK (TGFB2, TGFB3 and TGFBR2), insulin (PIK3R3, SHC1 and EIF4EBP1), and p53 signaling pathways (CCND2 and CDKN1A). In addition, a total of five hormone-related DEGs (SHC1, CAV1, RXRA, CDKN1A and SRF) were located in the center of PPI network and 12 hormone-related DEGs formed six protein modules.

To date, no studies have examined the role of QKI-5 in prostate cancer. The present study was designed to elucidate the correlation of QKI-5 expression with the clinical pathological features and prognosis of prostate cancer. In an overwhelming majority of the 184 cases of prostate cancer samples analyzed, the QKI-5 expression was significantly decreased, which was largely due to the high promoter methylation levels. Using lentiviral vectors, we established two stable prostate cancer cell lines with altered QKI-5 expression, including a QKI-5 overexpressing PC3 cell line and a DU145 cell line with knocked-down QKI-5 expression. The effects of the lentiviral-mediated QKI-5 knockdown on the PC3 cells and DU145 cells were assessed by cell growth curves, flow cytometry (FCM), and an invasion assay. The PC3 cells were transplanted into nude mice, and then, the tumor growth curves and TUNEL staining were determined. These results demonstrated that QKI-5 was highly expressed in benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) tissues but not in carcinomatous tissues and that QKI-5 effectively inhibited prostate cancer cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo. In addition, the decrease in QKI-5 expression was closely correlated with the prostate cancer Gleason score, poor differentiation, degree of invasion, lymph node metastasis, distant metastasis, TNM grading, and poor survival. These results indicate that the QKI-5 expression may be a novel, independent factor in the prognosis of prostate cancer patients.""","""['Yi Zhao', 'Gen Zhang', 'Mengying Wei', 'Xiaozhao Lu', 'Hanyan Fu', 'Feixue Feng', 'Shan Wang', 'Wei Lu', 'Ning Wu', 'Zifan Lu', 'Jianlin Yuan']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Cancer Biol Ther""","""['Downregulation of tumor suppressor QKI in gastric cancer and its implication in cancer prognosis.', 'Inhibition of N-myc downstream-regulated gene 2 in prostatic carcinoma.', 'LncRNA MEG3 inhibits the progression of prostate cancer by modulating miR-9-5p/QKI-5 axis.', 'QKI-6 inhibits bladder cancer malignant behaviours through down-regulating E2F3 and NF-κB signalling.', 'PC3, but not DU145, human prostate cancer cells retain the coregulators required for tumor suppressor ability of androgen receptor.', 'RNA-Binding Proteins in Bladder Cancer.', 'RNA splicing dysregulation and the hallmarks of cancer.', 'Research progress on RNA-binding proteins in breast cancer.', 'LncRNA CCAT1 enhances chemoresistance in hepatocellular carcinoma by targeting QKI-5.', 'RNA-binding protein QKI suppresses breast cancer via RASA1/MAPK signaling pathway.']"""

This is permitted by the exception for in-office ancillary services in the federal prohibition against self-referral. I examined the association between ownership of IMRT services and use of IMRT to treat prostate cancer.  Methods:   Using Medicare claims from 2005 through 2010, I constructed two samples: one comprising 35 self-referring urology groups in private practice and a matched control group comprising 35 non-self-referring urology groups in private practice, and the other comprising non-self-referring urologists employed at 11 National Comprehensive Cancer Network centers matched with 11 self-referring urology groups in private practice. I compared the use of IMRT in the periods before and during ownership and used a difference-in-differences analysis to evaluate changes in IMRT use according to self-referral status.  Results:   The rate of IMRT use by self-referring urologists in private practice increased from 13.1 to 32.3%, an increase of 19.2 percentage points (P<0.001). Among non-self-referring urologists, the rate of IMRT use increased from 14.3 to 15.6%, an increase of 1.3 percentage points (P=0.05). The unadjusted difference-in-differences effect was 17.9 percentage points (P<0.001). The regression-adjusted increase in IMRT use associated with self-referral was 16.4 percentage points (P<0.001). The rate of IMRT use by urologists working at National Comprehensive Cancer Network centers remained stable at 8.0% but increased by 33.0 percentage points among the 11 matched self-referring urology groups. The regression-adjusted difference-in-differences effect was 29.3 percentage points (P<0.001).  Conclusions:   Urologists who acquired ownership of IMRT services increased their use of IMRT substantially more than urologists who did not own such services. Allowing urologists to self-refer for IMRT may contribute to increased use of this expensive therapy.

Model conventional and stealth liposomes of genistein (GenLip)--incorporating unsaturated phospholipids and cholesterol--have demonstrated enhanced drug solubilization (over 350-folds > aqueous drug solution), shelf-life stability, and extended release profile. Owing to effective cellular delivery, preservation of genistein's antioxidant activity was confirmed through marked neutralization of peroxides via GenLip, in both quantitative and microscopic fluorescent-probe oxidation assays. Furthermore, significant broad-spectrum anticancer efficacy of GenLip, in murine and human cancer cell lines (p < 0.05-0.001), was achieved in a concentration and time-dependent manner--approx. 5-7 lower IC50 values versus all non-incorporated drug controls. Indicative of key pro-apoptotic activity, GenLip produced DNA laddering, with 1/3 of free drug solution content, and resulted in the highest induction level of P53-independent apoptotic pathway markers, compared to all treatments, in our assays (namely, mitochondrial polarization, and caspase-3/7 enzymes).

Methods:   Patients with invasive cancer of the breast, prostate, colon/rectum, or lung were enrolled from multiple sites. At enrollment during an outpatient visit and 4 or 5 weeks later, patients rated their symptoms on a numerical rating scale from zero to 10. A 2-point change on that scale was considered clinically significant for a change in fatigue. Effects of demographic and clinical factors on patient-reported fatigue were examined using logistic regression models.  Results:   In total, 3123 patients were enrolled at baseline, and 3032 patients could be analyzed for fatigue change. At baseline, 23% of patients had no fatigue, 35% had mild fatigue, 25% had moderate fatigue, and 17% had severe fatigue. Key parameters in a model of fatigue worsening included fatigue at baseline (odds ratio [OR], 0.75), disease status (OR, 1.99), performance status (OR, 1.38), history of depression (OR, 1.28), patient perception of bother because of comorbidity (OR, 1.26), and treatment exposures, including recent cancer treatment (OR, 1.77) and receipt of corticosteroids (OR, 1.37). The impact of sex was examined only in patients with colorectal and lung cancer, and it was a significant factor, with men most likely to experience worsening of fatigue (OR, 1.46).  Conclusions:   Predictors of fatigue worsening included multiple factors that were difficult to modify, including the baseline fatigue level, sex, disease status, performance status, recent cancer treatment, bother because of comorbidity, and history of depression.

Here, we demonstrate that although TBK1 is not overexpressed or constitutively activated in some tumor cells, targeting IKKi induces the activation of TBK1. Therefore, simultaneously targeting both kinases is necessary to efficiently suppress tumor cell proliferation. We show that three TBK1/IKKi dual inhibitors, which are based on a structurally rigid 2-amino-4-(3'-cyano-4'-pyrrolidine)phenyl-pyrimidine scaffold, potently inhibit cell viability in human breast, prostate and oral cancer cell lines. Treatment with these TBK1/IKKi dual inhibitors significantly impairs tumor development in xenograft and allograft mouse models. The anticancer function of these inhibitors may be partially due to their suppression of TBK1/IKKi-mediated AKT phosphorylation and VEGF expression. Most importantly, these TBK1/IKKi dual inhibitors have drug-like properties including low molecular weight, low cytochrome P450 inhibition and high metabolic stability.

Methods:   A new protein with potential 5α-reducing activity was expressed in CHO-K1 cellsandTOP10 E. coli for characterization.

This represents the molecular basis for GRP receptor imaging of prostate cancer with radioactive compounds. However, a focal, high density GRP receptor expression can be observed in hitherto uncharacterized prostate glands.  Methods:   GRP receptors were quantitatively measured with in vitro receptor autoradiography using ¹²⁵I-Tyr⁴ -bombesin in samples from 115 prostates. On successive tissue sections, ¹²⁵I-Tyr⁴ -bombesin autoradiography was compared with H&E staining and MIB-1 and 34βE12 immunohistochemistry.  Results:   On one hand, it was confirmed that GRP receptors were expressed in adenocarcinoma and high grade PIN in high density and high incidence (77% and 73%, respectively), but in normal prostate glands in low density and low frequency (18%). On the other hand, a novel and intriguing observation was the existence of focal non-invasive prostate glands with high GRP receptor density, characterized by low grade nuclear atypia and increased proliferation, compatible with lower grade PIN. There was a significant GRP receptor density gradient (P ≤ 0.005), increasing from normal prostate glands (mean relative optical density, ROD, of ¹²⁵I-Tyr⁴ -bombesin binding: 0.17) over atypical glands without increased MIB-1 labeling (0.28) and atypical glands with increased MIB-1 expression (0.44) to high grade PIN and adenocarcinoma (0.64 and 0.58, respectively).

In contrast, inhibition of TTP using siRNA increased the E2F1 expression. E2F1 mRNA contains three AREs within the 3'UTR, and TTP destabilized a luciferase mRNA that contained the E2F1 mRNA 3'UTR. Analyses of point mutants of the E2F1 mRNA 3'UTR demonstrated that ARE2 was mostly responsible for the TTP-mediated destabilization of E2F1 mRNA. RNA EMSA revealed that TTP binds directly to the E2F1 mRNA 3'UTR of ARE2. Moreover, treatment with siRNA against TTP increased the proliferation of PC3 human prostate cancer cells.

Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) as a screening tool for prostate cancer remains controversial. The aim was to determine the rate of PSA screening in New Zealand and to survey general practitioners' utility of PSA and their attitudes towards PSA screening.  Method:   A questionnaire was sent to 1000 general practitioners (GPs). In addition, a non-identifiable prospective audit of all registered New Zealand GPs' laboratory PSA tests was accessed for 2011.  Results:   Of the 931,923 males older than 40 years, 267,037 had a PSA test performed (28.3%). This percentage peaked in the 65-75 age group (45%). 263 GP questionnaires were completed. 79% of all GPs would initiate discussion of PSA testing.

We have previously identified genes with diverse functions that are upregulated in reactive stroma. This study tests the hypothesis that expression of these genes in stromal cells enhances prostate cancer growth in vivo.  Experimental design:   The expression of reactive stroma genes in prostate stromal cell lines was evaluated by reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR and qRT-PCR. Genes were knocked down using stable expression of short-hairpin RNAs (shRNA) and the impact on tumorigenesis assessed using the differential reactive stroma (DRS) system, in which prostate stromal cell lines are mixed with LNCaP prostate cancer cells and growth as subcutaneous xenografts assessed.  Results:   Nine of 10 reactive stroma genes tested were expressed in one or more prostate stromal cell lines. Gene knockdown of c-Kit, Wnt10B, Bmi1, Gli2, or COMP all resulted in decreased tumorigenesis in the DRS model. In all tumors analyzed, angiogenesis was decreased and there were variable effects on proliferation and apoptosis in the LNCaP cells. Wnt10B has been associated with stem/progenitor cell phenotype in other tissue types. Using a RT-PCR array, we detected downregulation of multiple genes involved in stem/progenitor cell biology such as OCT4 and LIF as well as cytokines such as VEGFA, BDNF, and CSF2 in cells with Wnt10B knockdown.  Conclusions:   These findings show that genes upregulated in prostate cancer-reactive stroma promote progression when expressed in prostate stromal cells. Moreover, these data indicate that the DRS model recapitulates key aspects of cancer cell/reactive stroma interactions in prostate cancer.""","""['Olga Dakhova', 'David Rowley', 'Michael Ittmann']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Clin Cancer Res""","""['Promotion of angiogenesis by ps20 in the differential reactive stroma prostate cancer xenograft model.', 'Stromal expression of connective tissue growth factor promotes angiogenesis and prostate cancer tumorigenesis.', 'Stromal cells promote angiogenesis and growth of human prostate tumors in a differential reactive stroma (DRS) xenograft model.', 'The reactive stroma microenvironment and prostate cancer progression.', 'Cellular Constituents of the Prostate Stroma: Key Contributors to Prostate Cancer Progression and Therapy Resistance.', 'The role of WNT10B in physiology and disease: A 10-year update.', 'Adaptive and non-adaptive gene expression responses in prostate cancer during androgen deprivation.', 'A novel immune-related gene-based prognostic signature to predict biochemical recurrence in patients with prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy.', 'Cartilage oligomeric matrix protein affects the biological behavior of papillary thyroid carcinoma cells by activating the PI3K/AKT/Bcl-2 pathway.', 'Hedgehog Signaling: Implications in Cancers and Viral Infections.']"""

The approval was based on clinical trial COU-AA-302, which randomly allocated asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients with chemotherapy-naïve mCRPC and no visceral metastases to either abiraterone acetate plus prednisone (N = 546) or placebo plus prednisone (N = 542). The coprimary endpoints were radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) and overall survival (OS). The median rPFS was 8.3 months in the placebo arm and had not yet been reached in the abiraterone acetate arm {HR, 0.43 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.35-0.52]; P < 0.0001}. A prespecified interim analysis demonstrated an improvement in OS favoring the abiraterone acetate arm [HR, 0.79 (95% CI, 0.66-0.96)] but did not cross the O'Brien-Fleming boundary for statistical significance. Safety data confirmed the known adverse reaction profile of abiraterone acetate. Full approval was granted on the basis of a large magnitude of effect on rPFS, a favorable trend in OS, and internal consistency across multiple secondary endpoints and exploratory patient-reported pain data. This is the first drug approval for mCRPC to use rPFS as the primary endpoint.

Ideal targets are proteins that are abundant in prostate tumors while absent in extra-prostatic tissues. The fusion of the androgen-regulated TMPRSS2 gene with the ETS transcription factor ERG occurs in approximately 50 % of prostate cancer cases and results in aberrant ERG expression. Because expression of ERG is very low in peripheral tissue, we evaluated the suitability of this protein as an antigen target in PCa vaccines. ERG-derived HLA-A*0201-restricted immunogenic epitopes were identified through a 3-step strategy that included in silico, in vitro, and in vivo validation. Algorithms were used to predict potential HLA-A*0201-binding epitopes. High-scoring epitopes were tested for binding to HLA-A*0201 using the T2-based stabilization assay in vitro. Five peptides were found to bind HLA-A*0201 and were subsequently tested for immunogenicity in humanized, HLA-A*0201 transgenic mice. The in vivo screening identified three immunogenic peptides. One of these peptides, ERG295, overcame peripheral tolerance in HLA-A*0201 mice that expressed prostate-restricted ERG. Also, this peptide induced an antigen-specific response against ERG-expressing human prostate tumor cells. Finally, tetramer assay showed detectable and responsive ERG295-specific cytotoxic lymphocytes in peripheral blood of HLA-A*0201(+) prostate cancer patients. Detection of ERG-specific CTLs in both mice and the blood of prostate cancer patients indicates that ERG-specific tolerance can be overcome.

Both genetic and epigenetic changes are regarded as important factors of colorectal carcinogenesis. Loss of DACH1 expression was found in breast, prostate, and endometrial cancer. To analyze the regulation and function of DACH1 in CRC, 5 colorectal cancer cell lines, 8 cases of normal mucosa, 15 cases of polyps and 100 cases of primary CRC were employed in this study. In CRC cell lines, loss of DACH1 expression was correlated with promoter region hypermethylation, and re-expression of DACH1 was induced by 5-Aza-2'-deoxyazacytidine treatment. We found that DACH1 was frequently methylated in primary CRC and this methylation was associated with reduction in DACH1 expression. These results suggest that DACH1 expression is regulated by promoter region hypermethylation in CRC. DACH1 methylation was associated with late tumor stage, poor differentiation, and lymph node metastasis. Re-expression of DACH1 reduced TCF/LEF luciferase reporter activity and inhibited the expression of Wnt signaling downstream targets (c-Myc and cyclinD1). In xenografts of HCT116 cells in which DACH1 was re-expressed, tumor size was smaller than in controls. In addition, restoration of DACH1 expression induced G2/M phase arrest and sensitized HCT116 cells to docetaxel. DACH1 suppresses CRC growth by inhibiting Wnt signaling both in vitro and in vivo. Silencing of DACH1 expression caused resistance of CRC cells to docetaxel. In conclusion, DACH1 is frequently methylated in human CRC and methylation of DACH1 may serve as detective and prognostic marker in CRC.""","""['Wenji Yan', 'Kongming Wu', 'James G Herman', 'Malcolm V Brock', 'François Fuks', 'Lili Yang', 'Hongbin Zhu', 'Yazhuo Li', 'Yunsheng Yang', 'Mingzhou Guo']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Epigenetics""","""['Epigenetic silencing of DACH1 induces the invasion and metastasis of gastric cancer by activating TGF-β signalling.', 'Silencing DACH1 promotes esophageal cancer growth by inhibiting TGF-β signaling.', 'Organoid modelling identifies that DACH1 functions as a tumour promoter in colorectal cancer by modulating BMP signalling.', 'Drug resistance in colorectal cancer: An epigenetic overview.', 'Roles of ARID1A variations in colorectal cancer: a collaborative review.', 'Study of DACH1 Expression and its Epigenetic Regulators as Possible Breast Cancer-Related Biomarkers.', 'Retinal determination gene networks: from biological functions to therapeutic strategies.', 'Epigenetic silencing of JAM3 promotes esophageal cancer development by activating Wnt signaling.', 'MicroRNAs regulating Wnt signaling pathway in colorectal cancer: biological implications and clinical potentials.', 'CRISPR/Cas9 application in cancer therapy: a pioneering genome editing tool.']"""

Patients and methods:   Since 1990, a random sample of men in Olmsted County (aged 40-49 years) has been followed up prospectively (n = 268), with biennial visits, including a urologic questionnaire, PSA screening, and physical examination. The ensuing risk of prostate cancer (CaP) was compared using survival analyses.  Results:   Median follow-up was 16.3 years (interquartile range 14.0-17.3, max 19.1). For men with a baseline PSA <1.0 ng/mL (n = 195), the risk of subsequent Gleason 6 CaP diagnosis by 55 years was 0.6% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0%-1.7%) and 15.7% (95% CI 6.5%-24.9%) for men with a baseline PSA ≥ 1.0 ng/mL. No man with a low baseline PSA developed an intermediate or high risk CaP, whereas 2.6% of men with a higher baseline PSA did (95% CI 0.58%-4.6%).  Conclusion:   Men (aged 40-49 years) can be stratified with a baseline PSA. If it is below 1.0 ng/mL, there is very little risk for developing a lethal CaP, and as many as 75% of men might be able to avoid additional PSA screening until 55 years.

The constituents were identified using spectral techniques in the light of literature. Sulphorhodamine B cytotoxicity screening of the isolated constituents was carried out against four human cancer cell lines including Lung (A-549), Leukaemia (THP-1), Prostate (PC-3) and Colon (HCT-116) cell lines. Ludartin (2) exhibited the highest cytotoxicity with IC50 values of 7.4μM, 3.1μM, 7.5μM and 6.9μM against Lung (A-549), Leukaemia (THP-1), Prostate (PC-3), Colon (HCT-116) cancer cell lines respectively.

Refinements in surgical technique, understanding of anatomy, and experience have led to more complex patients being offered surgery for management of organ-confined prostate cancer. Complication rates of robot-assisted prostatectomy have been reported in several articles; however, a paucity of data exists when evaluating ureteral injuries sustained during robot-assisted prostatectomy. No standardized universal criteria for reporting and grading of complications exists; therefore, the Martin-Donat criteria with Clavien-Dindo classification system were used to evaluate ureteral injuries in our series.  Patients and methods:   From January 2001 to June 2013, 6442 consecutive patients were treated with robot-assisted prostatectomy at the same institution by one of five surgeons. All complications were documented through a prospectively maintained prostate cancer database with supplementation from electronic medical records, operative and nursing notes, claims data, discharge summaries, outpatient and emergency visits, institutional morbidity and mortality data, as well as National Surgical Quality Improvement Program data. The Martin-Donat criteria were used to facilitate the accurate and comprehensive reporting of surgical complications while complication severity was assigned following the Clavien-Dindo classification system.  Results:   Three patients sustained ureteral injuries (ureteral transection) in our series. Both surgeons were beyond their learning curve (greater than 1000 cases) when the injuries occurred; one patient needed readmission, and all patients had risk factors predisposing them to ureteral injury.

Patients and methods:   We retrospectively identified 62 patients who underwent HoLEP for LUTS in the known presence of PCa at our center. Perioperative data were assessed including complications, functional outcomes, and quality of life (QoL). Giving respect to different disease characteristics, patients were stratified according to treatment strategy setting into palliative (I), radiation (II), and surveillance (III) groups and compared accordingly.  Results:   Median follow-up (FU) of the entire study cohort was 27 months (range 2-65 mos). Medians of functional parameters (International Prostate Symptom Score): 18.5 vs 4.5, QoL: 4 vs 1, maximal flow rate: 9.0 vs 18.8 mL/s and residual urine: 100 vs 0 mL, all P<0.05) improved significantly in all groups. Perioperative complications were low and without any statistically significant difference between the groups. Postoperatively, voiding was successful in 90.3% of all patients; at last FU, 17% had some degree of urinary incontinence. Treatment strategy groups showed comparable functional outcomes after HoLEP.  Conclusion:   In the presence of PCa and LUTS, HoLEP represents a feasible, safe, and effective treatment option for patients unfit or without indication for radical prostatectomy.

Materials and methods:   Ninety-eight consecutive patients (median age, 60.6 years; median prostate-specific antigen [PSA] value, 6.85 ng/mL) underwent triplane T2-weighted MRI on a 3-T magnet with an endorectal coil while undergoing diagnostic workup for prostate cancer. Prostate volume estimates were determined using the formula for ellipsoid volume based on tridimensional measurements, manual segmentation of triplane MRI, and automated segmentation based on normalized gradient fields cross-correlation and graph-search refinement. Estimates of prostate volume based on ellipsoid volume, manual segmentation, and automated segmentation were compared with prostatectomy specimen volumes. Prostate volume estimates were compared using the Pearson correlation coefficient and linear regression analysis. The Dice similarity coefficient was used to quantify spatial agreement between manual segmentation and automated segmentation.  Results:   The Pearson correlation coefficient revealed strong positive correlation between prostatectomy specimen volume and prostate volume estimates derived from manual segmentation (R = 0.89-0.91, p < 0.0001) and automated segmentation (R = 0.88-0.91, p < 0.0001).

The aim of this research study is to apply a graph-based algorithm to automated segmentation (i.e. delineation) of organ limits for the prostate central gland. The ultimate goal is to apply automated segmentation approach to facilitate efficient MR-guided biopsy and radiation treatment planning. The automated segmentation algorithm used is graph-driven based on a spherical template. Therefore, rays are sent through the surface points of a polyhedron to sample the graph's nodes. After graph construction--which only requires the center of the polyhedron defined by the user and located inside the prostate center gland--the minimal cost closed set on the graph is computed via a polynomial time s-t-cut, which results in the segmentation of the prostate center gland's boundaries and volume. The algorithm has been realized as a C++ module within the medical research platform MeVisLab and the ground truth of the central gland boundaries were manually extracted by clinical experts (interventional radiologists) with several years of experience in prostate treatment.

Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis to comprehensively evaluate such associations.  Methods:   We searched published literature from MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science and CBM for eligible publications. We also assessed genotype-based mRNA expression data from HapMap for rs7799039 (G2548A) and rs1137101 (Q223R) in normal cell lines derived from 270 subjects with different ethnicities.  Results:   The final analysis included 16 published studies of 6569 cases and 8405 controls for the LEP G2548A and 19 studies of 7504 cases and 9581 controls for the LEPR Q223R. Overall, LEP G2548A was statistically significantly associated with an increased risk of overall cancer (AA vs. GG: OR=1.27, 95% CI=1.05-1.54; recessive model: OR=1.19, 95% CI=1.00-1.41). Further stratifications by cancer type showed an increased risk for prostate cancer (recessive model: OR=1.26, 95% CI=1.05-1.51) but not for other cancers. For LEPR Q223R, no statistical evidence for an association with risk of cancer was found for all; however, further stratification by ethnicity showed an increased risk for Africans but not for other ethnicities. No significantly differences in LEP and LEPR mRNA expression were found among genotypes or by ethnicity.  Conclusions:   Despite some limitations, this meta-analysis found some statistical evidence for an association between the LEP 2548AA genotype and overall risk of cancer, particularly for prostate cancer, but given this variant did not have an effect on mRNA expression, this association warrants additional validation in large and well-designed studies.""","""['Jing He', 'Bo Xi', 'Rikje Ruiter', 'Ting-Yan Shi', 'Mei-Ling Zhu', 'Meng-Yun Wang', 'Qiao-Xin Li', 'Xiao-Yan Zhou', 'Li-Xin Qiu', 'Qing-Yi Wei']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Polymorphisms in three obesity-related genes (LEP, LEPR, and PON1) and breast cancer risk: a meta-analysis.', 'Association between Leptin G2548A and Leptin Receptor Q223R Polymorphisms with Type 2 Diabetes in an Iranian Population.', 'Effects of leptin and leptin receptor gene polymorphisms on lung cancer.', 'LEP and LEPR polymorphisms in non-Hodgkin lymphoma risk: a systematic review and pooled analysis.', 'Association of LEPR K109R polymorphisms with cancer risk: a systematic review and pooled analysis.', 'Association of leptin G2548A and leptin receptor Q223R polymorphisms and their serum levels with infertility and recurrent pregnancy loss in Iranian women with polycystic ovary syndrome.', 'Association of Single Nucleotide Polymorphism LEP-R c.668A>G (p.Gln223Arg, rs1137101) of leptin receptor gene with endometrial cancer.', 'Investigation of leptin receptor rs1137101 G>A polymorphism with cancer risk: evidence from 35936 subjects.', 'Leptin rs7799039 (G2548A) polymorphism is associated with cancer risk: a meta-analysis involving 25,799 subjects.', 'The influence of the rs1137101 genotypes of leptin receptor gene on the demographic and metabolic profile of normal Saudi females and those suffering from polycystic ovarian syndrome.']"""

Since then, the relationship between PSCA polymorphisms (rs2294008, rs2976392) and GC has been reported in various ethnic groups; however, these studies have yielded inconsistent results. To investigate this inconsistency, we performed a meta-analysis of 16 studies involving a total of 18,820 cases and 35,756 controls for the two widely studied polymorphisms of PSCA on genetic susceptibility for GC. Overall, the summary odds ratio for GC was 1.46 (95% CI 1.30-1.69, P < 10(-5)) and 1.49 (95% CI 1.22-1.82, P < 10(-4)) for PSCA rs2294008 and rs2976392 polymorphisms, respectively.

Although these nomograms were shown to be valid in several external validation cohorts of Caucasian patients, they have not been validated in non-Caucasian patients from Asian countries. We therefore validated these preoperative nomograms in a Japanese cohort, using different cutoff values of prostate-specific antigen concentrations for biochemical recurrence.  Methods:   We analyzed 637 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy for clinically localized prostate cancer at the Tokyo Medical University Hospital between February 2000 and January 2011. We evaluated two prostate-specific antigen cutoff values for biochemical recurrence, 0.2 and 0.4 ng/ml. Using c-index and calibration plots, we validated the previously developed Kattan and Stephenson nomograms.  Results:   Overall, the mean 5-year non-biochemical recurrence rate was 72 ± 4%. Using a prostate-specific antigen cutoff values of 0.2 and 0.4 ng/ml, the c-indices for the Kattan nomogram were 0.714 and 0.733. Similarly, using a prostate-specific antigen cutoff values of 0.2 and 0.4 ng/ml, the c-indices for the Stephenson nomograms were 0.717 and 0.671. The calibration plots showed that the predictive value of the Stephenson nomogram at a prostate-specific antigen cutoff of 0.2 ng/ml was close to the actual outcomes compared with other combinations of nomograms and prostate-specific antigen cutoff levels.  Conclusions:   Because the c-indices of both nomograms were generally high, these nomograms can be applied to our cohort.

A candidate marker is the HOXB13 gene, essential for prostate development. Some studies have shown expression of HOXB13 protein by immunohistochemistry in the nuclear compartment of benign prostate luminal epithelium and prostate carcinoma. Forty-two cases of biopsies and resection specimens of the prostate and urinary bladder, metastatic lymph nodes, and pelvic masses were retrieved from our databases. In all cases, doubt persisted regarding prostatic versus urothelial origin. All cases were stained for CK7, p63, p504s, PSA, CK20, and HOXB13. Chromogranin A, CD56, and synaptophysin were used when neuroendocrine differentiation was suspected. HOXB13 staining was negative or only weakly positive in all carcinomas of urothelial origin. Three of four carcinomas with neuroendocrine differentiation did not express HOXB13. The fourth carcinoma, in a patient with a history of prostate carcinoma, was positive. In two cases with a synchronous prostatic and urothelial carcinoma, HOXB13 was exclusively expressed in the prostatic carcinoma.

Methods:   Data from 336 patients who underwent RP for PC between 1992 and 2005 were analyzed. Variables, including the preoperative prostate-specific antigen (PSA), prostate volume, clinical stage, and pathologic stage, were compared across age groups (<65 or ≥65 years old). Preexisting comorbidities were evaluated by the CCI, and patients were classified into two CCI score categories (0 or ≥1).  Results:   The median (interquartile range) follow-up period was 96 (85-121) months. Subjects were divided into two subgroups according to age: <65 years (n = 151) or ≥65 years (n = 185). There was no significant difference in PSA, biopsy Gleason sum, body mass index, pathologic stage, or CCI between the two age groups. OCM was significantly associated with the CCI score (P = 0.011). Cumulative incidence estimates obtained from competing risk regression analysis indicated that CCI was not associated with CSM (P = 0.795) or OCM (P = 0.123) in the ≥65-year group. However, in men <65 years, cumulative incidence estimates for OCM were significantly associated with CCI (P = 0.036).  Conclusions:   CCI was independently associated with OCM after RP, but only in men <65 years old. CCI was not associated with CSM in either age group. Accordingly, a thorough evaluation of patient's comorbidities is mandatory when considering aggressive surgical treatment, especially in relatively young patients.""","""['Joo Yong Lee', 'Dae Hun Lee', 'Nam Hoon Cho', 'Koon Ho Rha', 'Young Deuk Choi', 'Sung Joon Hong', 'Seung Choul Yang', 'Kang Su Cho']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Ann Surg Oncol""","""['Age and Charlson Score.', 'Age-adjusted Charlson comorbidity index is a significant prognostic factor for long-term survival of patients with high-risk prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy: a Bayesian model averaging approach.', 'Impact of age and comorbidities on long-term survival of patients with high-risk prostate cancer treated with radical prostatectomy: a multi-institutional competing-risks analysis.', 'Cancer-Specific Mortality Among Korean Men with Localized or Locally Advanced Prostate Cancer Treated with Radical Prostatectomy Versus Radiotherapy: A Multi-Center Study Using Propensity Scoring and Competing Risk Regression Analyses.', 'Presurgical assessments.', 'Charlson Comorbidity Index: A Critical Review of Clinimetric Properties.', 'Efficacy and Safety of Robotic Procedures Performed Using the da Vinci Robotic Surgical System at a Single Institute in Korea: Experience with 10000 Cases.', 'Age-adjusted Charlson comorbidity index is a significant prognostic factor for long-term survival of patients with high-risk prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy: a Bayesian model averaging approach.', 'CHADS2 scores as a predictor of ischemic stroke after radical prostatectomy.']"""

In a computer simulation, intra-fractional motion traces from prior treatments with EMT were converted to a probability distribution function (PDF), truncated using a patient specific action volume that encloses allowed deviations from the planned position, and renormalized to yield a new PDF with EMT-gated interventions. In lieu of a conventional planning target volume (PTV), multiple instances of clinical target volume (CTV) and organs at risk (OARs) were replicated and displaced to extreme positions inside the action volume representing possible delivery scenarios. When optimizing the volumetric modulated arc therapy plan, doses to the CTV and OARs were calculated as a sum of doses to the replicas weighted by the PDF to account for motion. A treatment plan meeting the clinical constraints was produced and compared to the counterpart conventional margin (PTV) plan. EMT traces from a separate testing database served to simulate motion during gated delivery. Dosimetric end points extracted from dose accumulations for each motion trace were utilized to evaluate potential clinical benefit. Five prostate cases from a hypofractionated protocol (42.5 Gy in 5 fractions) were retrospectively investigated. The patient specific gating window resulted in tight anterior and inferior action levels (~1 mm) to protect rectal wall and bladder wall, and resulted in an average of four beam interruptions per fraction in the simulation. The robust-optimized plans achieved the same average CTV D95 coverage of 40.5 Gy as the PTV-optimized plans, but with reduced patient-averaged rectum wall D1cc by 2.2 Gy (range 0.7 to 4.7 Gy) and bladder wall mean dose by 2.9 Gy (range 2.0 to 3.4 Gy).

It has been suggested to be useful in the evaluation of carcinomas of mammary or urothelial origin or metastatic carcinomas, but its distribution in normal and neoplastic tissues is incompletely mapped. In this study, we examined normal developing and adult tissues and 2040 epithelial and 460 mesenchymal or neuroectodermal neoplasms for GATA3 expression to explore its diagnostic value in surgical pathology, using monoclonal antibody (clone L50-823) and Leica Bond automated immunohistochemistry. GATA3 was expressed in trophoblast, fetal and adult epidermis, adult mammary and some salivary gland and sweat gland ductal epithelia, urothelia, distal nephron in developing and adult tissues, some prostatic basal cells, and subsets of T lymphocytes. It was expressed stronger in fetal than in adult mesothelia and was absent in respiratory and gastrointestinal epithelia. In epithelial neoplasms, GATA3 was expressed in >90% of primary and metastatic ductal and lobular carcinomas of the breast, urothelial, and cutaneous basal cell carcinomas and trophoblastic and endodermal sinus tumors. In metastatic breast carcinomas, it was more sensitive than GCDFP. Among squamous cell carcinomas, the expression was highest in the skin (81%) and lower in cervical (33%), laryngeal (16%), and pulmonary tumors (12%). Common positivity was found in skin adnexal tumors (100%), mesothelioma (58%), salivary gland (43%), and pancreatic (37%) ductal carcinomas, whereas frequency of expression in adenocarcinomas of lung, stomach, colon, endometrium, ovary, and prostate was <10%. Chromophobe renal cell carcinoma was a unique renal tumor with frequent positivity (51%), whereas oncocytomas were positive in 17% of cases but other types only rarely. Among mesenchymal and neuroectodermal tumors, paragangliomas were usually positive, which sets these tumors apart from epithelial neuroendocrine tumors. Mesenchymal tumors were only sporadically positive, except epithelia of biphasic synovial sarcomas. GATA3 is a useful marker in the characterization of not only mammary and urothelial but also renal and germ cell tumors, mesotheliomas, and paragangliomas.

To address the relative contribution to clinical prognosis by these distinct patterns, the histology of 241 consecutive radical prostatectomy specimens with the highest Gleason grade of 4 was reviewed. The presence of poorly formed glands, fused glands, and cribriform pattern was recorded for each case, and the types of architectural patterns present were associated with patient outcome. In this population, prostatic adenocarcinomas demonstrated architectural heterogeneity, with 17% of cases exhibiting a single Gleason grade 4 pattern, and 41% of cases exhibiting all 3 morphologic patterns. Patients exhibiting all 3 architectural patterns had lower rates of biochemical disease-free survival (66% vs. 76% at 5 y; log rank P=0.006). Twenty-two of 165 patients (13.3%) with cribriform pattern adenocarcinoma developed metastasis, whereas 2 of 76 patients (2.6%) without cribriform pattern developed metastasis at a median postoperative follow-up of 10.0 years. The presence of a cribriform pattern was an independent predictor for biochemical recurrence (hazard ratio 2.41; 95% confidence interval, 1.34-4.32; P=0.003) as well as metastasis after radical prostatectomy (hazard ratio 5.62; 95% confidence interval, 1.29-24.5; P=0.02).

Here, we evaluate Decipher, a genomic classifier (GC), for its ability to predict metastasis following BCR.  Methods:   The study population included 85 clinically high-risk patients who developed BCR after RP. Time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, weighted Cox proportional hazard models and decision curves were used to compare GC scores to Gleason score (GS), PSA doubling time (PSAdT), time to BCR (ttBCR), the Stephenson nomogram and CAPRA-S for predicting metastatic disease progression. All tests were two-sided with a type I error probability of 5%.  Results:   GC scores stratified men with BCR into those who would or would not develop metastasis (8% of patients with low versus 40% with high scores developed metastasis, P<0.001). The area under the curve for predicting metastasis after BCR was 0.82 (95% CI, 0.76-0.86) for GC, compared to GS 0.64 (0.58-0.70), PSAdT 0.69 (0.61-0.77) and ttBCR 0.52 (0.46-0.59). Decision curve analysis showed that GC scores had a higher overall net benefit compared to models based solely on clinicopathologic features. In multivariable modeling with clinicopathologic variables, GC score was the only significant predictor of metastasis (P=0.003).  Conclusions:   When compared to clinicopathologic variables, GC better predicted metastatic progression among this cohort of men with BCR following RP.

One miR candidate found to be upregulated by ionizing radiation was miR-95, the enforced expression of which promoted radiation resistance in a variety of cancer cells. miR-95 overexpression recapitulated an aggressive phenotype including increased cellular proliferation, deregulated G2-M checkpoint following ionizing radiation, and increased invasive potential. Using combined in silico prediction and microarray expression analyses, we identified and validated the sphingolipid phosphatase SGPP1, an antagonist of sphingosine-1-phosphate signaling, as a target of miR-95 that promotes radiation resistance. Consistent with this finding, cell treatment with FTY720, a clinically approved small molecule inhibitor of S1P signaling, sensitized miR-95 overexpressing cells to radiation treatment. In vivo assays extended the significance of these results, showing that miR-95 overexpression increased tumor growth and resistance to radiation treatment in tumor xenografts.

Patients and methods:   A prospective cohort of 1,147 men, nested within the Prostate Testing for Cancer and Treatment trial and recommended to receive prostate biopsy, completed questionnaires assessing physical and psychological harms after biopsy in the Prostate Biopsy Effects study. Psychological impact was measured using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and scores were compared according to experiences of biopsy-related symptoms at biopsy, and at 7 and 35 days afterward, and in relation to biopsy results.  Results:   A total of 1,144 men (99.7%) returned questionnaires at biopsy, with 1,090 (95.0%) and 1,016 (88.6%) responding at 7 and 35 days postbiopsy. Most men experienced biopsy-related symptoms as no problem or a minor problem, and overall levels of anxiety and depression were low and similar to normative levels. Of men receiving a negative biopsy result (n = 471), anxiety was greater in those experiencing problematic biopsy-related symptoms compared with those experiencing nonproblematic symptoms at 7 days for the following symptoms: pain (P < .001), shivers, (P = .020), hematuria (P < .001), hematochezia (P < .001), and hemoejaculate (P < .001). Anxiety was reduced, although symptoms were not, after 35 days. Overall levels of anxiety were low across all time points except at the 35-day assessment among men who had received a cancer diagnosis.  Conclusion:   Problematic postbiopsy symptoms can lead to increased anxiety, distinct from distress related to diagnosis of prostate cancer. Men and doctors need to consider these additional potential harms of biopsy when deciding whether to initiate prostate-specific antigen testing.""","""['Julia Wade', 'Derek J Rosario', 'Rhiannon C Macefield', 'Kerry N L Avery', 'C Elizabeth Salter', 'M Louise Goodwin', 'Jane M Blazeby', 'J Athene Lane', 'Chris Metcalfe', 'David E Neal', 'Freddie C Hamdy', 'Jenny L Donovan']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Clin Oncol""","""[""Prostate cancer: Biopsy--it's stressful!"", 'Morbidity and psychological impact of prostate biopsy: the future calls for a change.', 'Measuring the psychosocial impact of population-based prostate-specific antigen testing for prostate cancer in the UK.', 'Psychological impact of serial prostate-specific antigen tests in Japanese men waiting for prostate biopsy.', 'The psychological impact of prostate biopsy: Prevalence and predictors of procedure-related distress.', 'Psychological distress and prostate specific antigen levels in men with and without prostate cancer.', 'Screening for prostate cancer.', 'Radical Prostatectomy without Prior Biopsy in Patients with High Suspicion of Prostate Cancer Based on Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen Positron Emission Tomography: A Prospective Cohort Study.', ""'Is it painful'?

The wild-type UGDH enzyme purifies in a hexamer-dimer equilibrium and transiently undergoes dynamic motion that exposes the dimer-dimer interface during catalysis. In the current study we created and characterized point mutations that yielded exclusively dimeric species (obligate dimer, T325D), dimeric species that could be induced to form hexamers in the ternary complex with substrate and cofactor (T325A), and a previously described exclusively hexameric species (UGDHΔ132) to investigate the role of quaternary structure in regulation of the enzyme. Characterization of the purified enzymes revealed a significant decrease in the enzymatic activity of the obligate dimer and hexamer mutants. Kinetic analysis of wild-type UGDH and the inducible hexamer, T325A, showed that upon increasing enzyme concentration, which favors the hexameric species, activity was modestly decreased and exhibited cooperativity. In contrast, cooperative kinetic behavior was not observed in the obligate dimer, T325D. These observations suggest that the regulation of the quaternary assembly of the enzyme is essential for optimal activity and allosteric regulation. Comparison of kinetic and thermal stability parameters revealed structurally dependent properties consistent with a role for controlled assembly and disassembly of the hexamer in the regulation of UGDH. Finally, both T325A and T325D mutants were significantly less efficient in promoting downstream hyaluronan production by HEK293 cells. These data support a model that requires an operational dimer-hexamer equilibrium to function efficiently and preserve regulated activity in the cell.""","""['Annastasia S Hyde', 'Ashley M Thelen', 'Joseph J Barycki', 'Melanie A Simpson']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Biol Chem""","""['Integration of Sugar Metabolism and Proteoglycan Synthesis by UDP-glucose Dehydrogenase.', 'Inhibiting Hexamer Disassembly of Human UDP-Glucose Dehydrogenase by Photoactivated Amino Acid Cross-Linking.', 'Computational analysis of the quaternary structural changes induced by point mutations in human UDP-glucose dehydrogenase.', 'Characterization of human UDP-glucose dehydrogenase reveals critical catalytic roles for lysine 220 and aspartate 280.', 'UDP-glucose dehydrogenase: structure and function of a potential drug target.', 'UDP-glucose dehydrogenase (UGDH) activity is suppressed by peroxide and promoted by PDGF in fibroblast-like synoviocytes: Evidence of a redox control mechanism.', 'Mechanisms of coordinating hyaluronan and glycosaminoglycan production by nucleotide sugars.', 'Cloning, Expression and Characterization of UDP-Glucose Dehydrogenases.', 'Altered glucuronidation deregulates androgen dependent response profiles and signifies castration resistance in prostate cancer.', 'Integration of Sugar Metabolism and Proteoglycan Synthesis by UDP-glucose Dehydrogenase.']"""

However, the comprehensive mechanisms remain largely unclear. In this study, we first established a CDDP-resistant pancreatic cancer cell line-BXPC-3/CDDP from its parental cell line-BXPC-3. The results showed that CDDP resistance in BXPC-3/CDDP cells correlates with changes in cellular EMT phenotypes. Prostate apoptosis response-4 (Par-4) expression at both mRNA and protein levels were reduced in CDDP-resistant BXPC-3/CDDP cells compared with that in BXPC-3 cells. Ectopic expression of Par-4 reversed EMT and CDDP resistance in BXPC-3/CDDP cells. In BXPC-3 cells, knockdown of Par-4 expression induces EMT and CDDP insensitivity, however, these effects were blocked by inhibition of PI3K/Akt pathway using LY294002. Furthermore, Par-4 knockdown could significantly stimulate PI3K/Akt signaling in BXPC-3 cells. In vivo studies, xenograft BXPC-3 tumors were sensitive to CDDP treatment. Treatment with CDDP alone had little effect on the growth of Par-4 siRNA-transfected BXPC-3 tumors in nude mice and the survival rate compared with control. Inhibition of PI3K/Akt pathway using LY294002 reversed CDDP resistance in Par-4 siRNA-transfected BXPC-3 tumors. In conclusion, these results indicate that Par-4 downregulation confers CDDP resistance via PI3K/Akt pathway-dependent EMT in BXPC-3 cells.

Objective:   To explore whether urothelial carcinoma of the upper urinary tract (UUT) and/or prostatic urethra may be a cause for BCG failure.  Design, setting, and participants:   Retrospective analysis of 110 patients with high-risk NMIBC repeatedly treated with intravesical BCG, diagnosed with disease recurrence, and followed for a median time of 9.1 yr.  Intervention:   Two or more intravesical BCG induction courses without maintenance.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Primary outcome was pattern of disease recurrence (BCG failure) within the urinary tract categorised into UUT and/or urethral carcinoma (with or without intravesical recurrence), and intravesical recurrence alone. Secondary outcome was survival. Predictors of UUT and/or urethral carcinoma and the effect of pattern of disease recurrence on cancer-specific survival were assessed with multivariable Cox regression analysis adjusting for multiple clinical and tumour characteristics.  Results and limitations:   Of the 110 patients, 57 (52%) had UUT and/or urethral carcinoma (with or without intravesical recurrence), and 53 (48%) had intravesical recurrence alone. In patients with UUT and/or urethral carcinoma, bladder carcinoma in situ (Tis) before the first and second BCG course was present in 42 of 57 (74%) and 47 of 57 (82%) patients, respectively. On multivariable analysis, bladder Tis before the first and/or second BCG course was the only independent predictor of UUT and/or urethral carcinoma. Of the 110 patients, 69 (63%) were alive at last follow-up visit, 18 (16%) had died due to metastatic urothelial carcinoma, and 23 (21%) had died of other causes. Pattern of disease recurrence within the urinary tract was not an independent predictor of cancer-specific survival. Main study limitations were retrospective design and limited power for survival analysis.  Conclusions:   In our patients with high-risk NMIBC failing after two or more courses of intravesical BCG, UUT and/or urethral carcinoma was detected in >50% of the cases during follow-up. The vast majority of these patients had bladder Tis before the first and/or second BCG course.

In this study, we identified two new compounds, zanthoxyloside (1) and schinifolisatin A (13), along with 23 known coumarins (2-12) and lignans (14-25), from a methanol extract of the stems of Z. schinifolium . The chemical structures of the compounds were determined by mass, 1D-, and 2D NMR spectroscopy. The anticancer effects of the isolated compounds were examined in three human cancer cell lines. Compounds 10-12 significantly reduced the proliferation of HL-60 human acute promyelocytic leukemia cells with IC50 values of 4.62-5.12 μM. Treatment of PC-3 prostate cancer cells and SNU-C5 colorectal cancer cells with compound 10 resulted in potent antiproliferative activity, with IC50 values of 4.39 and 6.26 μM, respectively.

Aims:   To determine the most representative waiting times in breast, lung, colon and prostate cancer care in several regions of France. To analyze the influence of individual, medical or health care system factors on those waiting times.  Methods:   This study was piloted by the French Cancer Institute in partnership with the National Federation of the Regional Health Observatories and was driven by the Regional Oncology Networks and the Regional Health Observatories. In 2011, 2,530 women with breast cancer and 1,945 patient with lung cancer were included in eight regions, and in 2012, 3,248 patients with colon cancer and 4,207 men with prostate cancer were included in 13 regions, two of which were overseas departments. Data were analyzed from multidisciplinary discussion reports and from medical records.  Results:   The mean time intervals (± standard deviation) for the various components of access to care were as follows in breast cancer: mammography to pathologist diagnosis, 17,7 days (±15,9); diagnosis (or treatment proposal) to surgery, 22,9 days (±13,9). In lung cancer: first suspect medical image to pathologist diagnosis, 21,5 days (±17,6); diagnosis to treatment proposal, 13,5 days (±10,7). In colon cancer: coloscopy to pathologist diagnosis, 4,5 days (±4,1); diagnosis to surgery, 18,9 days (±14,9). In prostate cancer: pathologist diagnosis to treatment proposal, 36,5 days (±26,5); treatment proposal to surgery, 45,2 days (±30,1). Data collection was particularly difficult because of very heterogeneous way in medical records filling by care centers, so the data collection method used in the study could not be used in routine procedures. Waiting times measured in the four cancers had an important variability. In fact, age, circumstance of diagnosis, tumor stage and category of care center had an influence. After considering those different factors, differences between regions remained from range 2 to 4. Those regional differences could be explained by organizational factors but were not explored in our study. In the same way, data on individual factors (social vulnerability, category of employment) were not available to measure their effects on this study. Besides, our results were comparable to those in international publications or national recommendations in other countries.  Conclusion:   These results suggest that waiting times could be good indicators and could reveal inequalities in cancer care access. Measuring them would lead to characterize those inequalities and to propose actions to improve access to cancer care whose impact could be measured.""","""['Graziella Pourcel', 'Bernard Ledesert', 'Philippe-Jean Bousquet', 'Claudia Ferrari', 'Jérôme Viguier', 'Agnès Buzyn']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Bull Cancer""","""['Waiting time disparities in breast cancer diagnosis and treatment: a population-based study in France.', ""Social inequalities and cancer: can the European deprivation index predict patients' difficulties in health care access? a pilot study."", 'Edifice program: analysis of screening exam practices for cancer in France.', 'Using cancer case identification algorithms in medico-administrative databases: Literature review and first results from the REDSIAM Tumors group based on breast, colon, and lung cancer.', 'Dealing with Waiting Times in Health Systems - An International Comparative Overview.', '1-year mortality in lung cancer in France according to key timepoints of care pathways.', 'Delays in the Surgical Pathway in Breast cancer Patients in Tunisia: A Descriptive Prospective Study.', 'Waiting Times for Prostate Cancer Diagnosis in a Nigerian Population.', 'Waiting times for prostate cancer: A review.', 'Preoperative clinical pathway of breast cancer patients: determinants of compliance with EUSOMA quality indicators.']"""

The nuclear envelope is a barrier to large protein entry, and this process is regulated by intracellular calcium [Ca(2+)]i and trans-nuclear potential. How β-catenin traverses the nuclear envelope is not well known. We hypothesized that Wnt/Ca(2+) and Wnt/β-catenin pathways act in a coordinated manner and that [Ca(2+)]i release facilitates β-catenin entry into the nucleus in mammalian cells. In a live assay using calcium dyes in PC3 prostate cancer cells, six Wnt peptides (3A, 4, 5A, 7A, 9B, and 10B) mobilized [Ca(2+)]i but Wnt11 did not. Based upon dwell time (range = 15-30 s) of the calcium waveform, these Wnts could be classified into three classes: short, 3A and 5A; long, 7A and 10B; and very long, 4 and 9B. Wnt-activated [Ca(2+)]i release was followed by an increase in intranuclear calcium and the depolarization of both the cell and nuclear membranes, determined by using FM4-64. In cells treated with Wnts 5A, 9B, and 10B, paradigm substrates for each Wnt class, increased [Ca(2+)]i was followed by β-catenin translocation into the nucleus in PC3, MCF7, and 253J, prostate, breast, and bladder cancer cell lines; both the increase in Wnt 5A, 9B, and 10B induced [Ca(2+)]i release and β-catenin translocation are suppressed by thapsigargin in PC3 cell line.

In Italy, these activities are mainly organized on a regional level. Incidence depends on the distribution of risk factors in the population and is monitored to assess the efficacy of primary prevention programs as well as to measure the effect of screening activities. Mortality is a summary indicator incorporating the effects of both occurrence and survival. Finally, the prevalence of people with a diagnosis of cancer within a population is a direct measure of the demand for health care and social services. When taken separately, each of these indicators provides a partial view of the cancer phenomenon and should therefore be interpreted with caution. In this paper we give some examples of the uses of these indicators, and also of the interpretation difficulties by relating the regional cancer incidence to tobacco use, overweight and residence in polluted sites. We comment on the observed mortality trends in terms of their contribution to incidence and survival. We associate the estimated trends in cancer prevalence from 1990 to 2015 with the gross domestic product, an indicator of the resources available in Italy.

The aim of this paper is to provide estimates of the incidence, mortality and prevalence of seven major cancers for the entire region in the period 1970-2015.  Methods:   The estimates were obtained by applying the MIAMOD method, a statistical back-calculation approach to derive incidence and prevalence figures starting from mortality and relative survival data. Estimates were compared with the available observed data.  Results:   In 2012 the lowest incidence was estimated for stomach cancer and melanoma among men, with 140 and 74 new cases, respectively, per 100,000. The mortality rates were highest for lung cancer and were very close to the incidence rates (77 and 95 per 100,000, respectively). In women, breast was by far the most frequent cancer site both in terms of incidence (1,512 new cases) and mortality (295 deaths), followed by colon-rectum (493 cases and 201 deaths), lung (205 cases and 167 deaths), melanoma (106 cases and 15 deaths), stomach (82 cases and 61 deaths), and uterine cervix (36 cases and 19 deaths). The highest prevalence was estimated for breast cancer (15,180 cases), followed by colorectal cancer with about 7,300 prevalent cases in both sexes.  Conclusion:   This paper provides a description of the burden of the major cancers in Sardinia until 2015. The comparisons between the estimated age-standardized incidence rates and those observed in the Sassari registry indicate good agreement. The estimates show a general decrease in cancer mortality, with the exception of female lung cancer. By contrast, the prevalence is steeply increasing for all considered cancers (with the only exception of cancer of the uterine cervix).

Methods:   The estimates were computed by applying the MIAMOD method, a statistical back-calculation approach to derive incidence and prevalence figures starting from mortality and relative survival data. Published data from the Italian cancer registries were modeled in order to estimate the regional cancer survival.  Results:   In 2012 the most common cancers were breast cancer in women, colorectal cancer in both sexes, and prostate cancer in men, with about 4,000, 3,500 and 3,000 estimated new cases, respectively. The highest crude mortality rates were estimated for lung cancer in men (63.6 per 100,000) and breast cancer in women (30.8 per 100,000) and the lowest for skin melanoma (both sexes) and cancer of the cervix uteri. For colorectal, lung and stomach cancer and skin melanoma, all the indicators were higher in men than women. The prevalence figures in women were more than 9 times the incidence figures for breast cancer and more than 10 times the incidence figures for skin melanoma. The prevalence was twice the incidence for lung cancer in both sexes. The prevalence increased for all the considered cancers except cervical cancer.  Conclusion:   According to our analyses in Sicily we expect about 14,000 new diagnoses and 5,500 deaths for the major cancer types in a year, while about 92,000 persons with a diagnosis of the considered cancers were alive in 2012.

Survival was modeled on the basis of published data from the Italian cancer registries.  Results:   In 2012 the most frequent cancers were colorectal, breast and lung cancer with 3,969, 3,675 and 3,629 new diagnosed cases, respectively. The cancers with increasing incidence trends were breast cancer, lung cancer and skin melanoma in women, and colorectal cancer and skin melanoma in men. By contrast, the incidence rates of uterine cervix cancer and stomach cancer were decreasing. In men the lung and prostate cancer incidence rates increased, reaching a peak in different periods, and then decreased and stabilized, respectively. Prevalence was increasing for all considered cancers with the exception of cervical cancer. The highest values in 2012 were estimated for breast and colorectal cancer (34,000 and 22,000 prevalent cases, respectively). In the final period under study there was a decline in mortality for all cancers except female lung cancer. The highest crude mortality rates in 2012 were estimated for lung cancer in men and breast cancer in women: 80 and 31 per 100,000, respectively.  Conclusion:   This paper provides a description of the burden of the major cancers in Campania until 2015. The estimates highlight the need to reinforce organized screening, especially for breast and colorectal cancer, and to support evidence-based prevention campaigns against female smoking. All these aspects require continuous and updated monitoring of the main epidemiological indicators in the Campania population.""","""['Mario Fusco', 'Roberta De Angelis', 'Gennaro Senatore', 'Giulia Zigon', 'Silvia Rossi']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Tumori""","""['Estimates of cancer burden in Lazio.', 'Estimates of cancer burden in Puglia.', 'Estimates of cancer burden in Veneto.', 'Mortality Atlas of the Campania Region.

The aim of this paper is to provide estimates of cancer incidence, mortality and prevalence for the Abruzzo and Molise regions combined.  Methods:   The MIAMOD method, a back-calculation approach to estimate and project the incidence of chronic diseases from mortality and patient survival, was used for the estimation of incidence and prevalence by calendar year (from 1970 to 2015) and age (from 0 to 99). The survival estimates are based on cancer registry data of southern Italy.  Results:   The most frequently diagnosed cancers were those of the colon and rectum, breast and prostate, with 1,394, 1,341 and 698 new diagnosed cases, respectively, estimated in 2012. Incidence rates were estimated to increase constantly for female breast cancer, colorectal cancer in men and melanoma in both sexes. For prostate cancer and male lung cancer, the incidence rates increased, reaching a peak, and then decreased. In women the incidence of colorectal and lung cancer stabilized after an initial increase. For stomach and cervical cancers, the incidence rates showed a constant decrease. Prevalence was increasing for all the considered cancer sites with the exception of the cervix uteri. The highest prevalence values were estimated for breast and colorectal cancer with about 12,300 and over 8,200 cases in 2012, respectively. In the 2000s the mortality rates declined for all cancers except skin melanoma and female lung cancer, for which the mortality was almost stable.  Conclusion:   This paper provides a description of the burden of the major cancers in Abruzzo and Molise until 2015.

The aim of the present study is to produce projections of cancer incidence, mortality and prevalence for the Umbria region (900,000 inhabitants) in central Italy.  Methods:   The estimations were obtained by applying the MIAMOD method, a statistical back-calculation approach to derive incidence and prevalence figures starting from mortality and relative survival data. Published data from the Italian cancer registries were modeled in order to estimate regional cancer survival. Estimated incidence rates were validated with observed incidence rates obtained from the Umbria regional cancer registry.  Results:   The most frequent cancer sites estimated were colon-rectum, prostate and breast in women, with 970, 615 and 729 new diagnoses, respectively, in 2012. The incidence rates were increasing for female lung cancer, male colorectal cancer, and melanoma. By contrast, the rates have been declining for cervix and stomach cancer.

The incidence rates of breast cancer rose, reaching a plateau in the mid 2010s. Favorable mortality trends were predicted for all cancers except skin melanoma and lung cancer in women. The prevalence of cancer was increasing with the only exception of cervical cancer in women and lung cancer in men in the most recent estimation period.  Conclusion:   The scenario found for cancer incidence and prevalence was largely influenced by screening activities, so that increasing or stable incidence rates may reflect active preventive efforts.

Methods:   The estimated figures were obtained by applying the MIAMOD method. Starting from mortality and survival data, incidence and prevalence were derived using a statistical back-calculation approach.

The incidence rates were steadily increasing for lung cancer in women and melanoma in both sexes, while they were decreasing for uterine cervix cancer in women, lung cancer in men and stomach cancer in both sexes. For colorectal cancer a small reduction in incidence was estimated for both sexes in recent years. The incidence rates for prostate cancer, after a steep increase and subsequent stabilization, were estimated to increase slightly in the last years. The breast cancer incidence was estimated to stabilize in the last 10 years. The mortality trends were decreasing for all considered cancers except female lung cancer.

Methods:   The MIAMOD method, a statistical back-calculation approach, was applied to estimate incidence, mortality and prevalence figures, in the period 1970-2015, using mortality data from the Italian National Institute of Statistics and relative survival data from Italian cancer registries.  Results:   We estimated that the cancer sites with the highest incidence rates in the forthcoming years will be breast in women (with an age-standardized incidence rate of 130 per 100,000 in 2015), prostate in men (97 per 100,000) and colon-rectum in both sexes (85 and 42 per 100,000 in men and women, respectively). The incidence rates for lung cancer will continue to decrease only in men (down to 43 per 100,000 in 2015). Although the decline in the mortality rates of lung, breast and colorectal cancers is likely to persist, these tumors will remain the big killers in the near future. The number of people living in Friuli Venezia Giulia after a cancer diagnosis is expected to continue to rise in particular for breast cancer (with a crude prevalence of 3,000 per 100,000 women in 2015), prostate cancer (1,700 per 100,000 men) and colorectal cancer (1,100 and 800 per 100,000 in men and women, respectively).

Mortality data were provided by ISTAT for the period 1970-2002 while survival was modeled on the basis of published data from the Italian cancer registries.  Results:   The estimates for 2012 show that breast cancer was the most common cancer in women and prostate cancer was most common in men. Incidence and mortality were decreasing for cervix cancer and stomach cancer in both genders during the whole study period. The lung cancer incidence and mortality were decreasing in men but increasing in women. The colorectal cancer incidence rose in both genders while the mortality was decreasing in women.

One population-based cancer registry is present in the region, providing incidence and survival data for the Genoa province (covering 55% of the regional population). This paper will estimate the incidence, prevalence and mortality in the Liguria region for cancers of the lung, breast, prostate, colon-rectum, stomach and uterine cervix and melanoma of the skin in 1970-2015.  Methods:   The estimated figures were obtained by applying the MIAMOD method. Starting from mortality and survival data, incidence and prevalence were derived using a statistical back-calculation approach.

The MIAMOD method was applied also to estimate the colorectal cancer incidence, mortality and prevalence rates in the Ligurian provinces in the period 1988-2015.  Results:   In 2012 about 1,500 new cases of breast cancer were expected in Ligurian women. The estimates for the other cancer sites were considerably lower, ranging from 839 (colon-rectum) to 54 (cervix). In men about 1,400 new cases were estimated for prostate cancer, while the incidence for the other sites ranged from 1,118 (colon-rectum) to 208 (skin melanoma). The breast cancer prevalence rate was more than 10 times the incidence rate in women, and the lung cancer prevalence rate was more than double the incidence rate in both sexes. Mortality rates were highest for lung cancer in men and breast cancer in women; the lowest rates were estimated for melanoma and cancer of the uterine cervix.  Conclusion:   In Liguria a large portion of the health expenditure has been devoted to diagnostic and therapeutic resources.

The objective of this paper is to provide estimates of the incidence and mortality rates and prevalence proportions for cancer of the lung, breast, cervix, prostate, colon-rectum and stomach and melanoma of the skin for 2012 and the time trends up to 2015 for the Piedmont and Aosta Valley regions.  Methods:   The estimates were obtained by applying the MIAMOD method, a statistical back-calculation approach to derive incidence and prevalence figures starting from mortality and relative survival data. Published data from the Italian cancer registries were modeled in order to estimate the regional cancer survival. The MIAMOD estimates were also compared with those obtained by applying a method based on the mortality-incidence and prevalence-incidence ratios.  Results:   The most frequently diagnosed cancers in absolute terms were prostate, colorectal, breast and lung cancer with about 5,000, 4,700, 3,300, and 2,900 new cases, respectively, in 2012. Incidence rates were rising for melanoma in both sexes and lung cancer in women, while they diminished for cervical and stomach cancer. For prostate cancer and male lung cancer the rates initially increased but were estimated to decrease in the most recent period. Colorectal cancer also increased up to the 1990s but was estimated to reach a plateau in the final years of estimation. Prevalence increased for all the considered cancers with the exception of cervical cancer. Mortality was declining for all considered cancers with the exception of lung cancer in women.  Conclusions:   Monitoring indicators of the cancer burden is crucial for setting priorities among possible health system activities in a limited-resource setting. Piedmont has long invested in organized, population-based screening programs: these will have to be extended and accompanied by greater efforts in primary prevention.""","""['Stefano Rosso', 'Lidia Sacchetto', 'Adriano Giacomin', 'Roberto Foschi', 'Roberta De Angelis', 'Silvia Rossi', 'Roberto Zanetti']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Tumori""","""['Estimates of cancer burden in Lazio.', 'Estimates of cancer burden in Campania.', 'Estimates of cancer burden in Umbria.', 'Annual report to the nation on the status of cancer, 1975-2000, featuring the uses of surveillance data for cancer prevention and control.', 'Epidemiology of cancer in the United States.']"""

Bone-seeking radiopharmaceuticals have been approved for palliation of painful skeletal metastases, but their clinical use is limited by concerns of toxicities both when administered alone and especially when combined with chemotherapy agents.  Objective:   We investigated whether docetaxel administered to mCRPC patients after treatment with samarium-153-labeled ethylene-diamine-tetra-methylene-phosphonic acid (Sm-EDTMP) has increased toxicity and/or reduced antitumor efficacy.  Materials and methods:   Thirty mCRPC patients with skeletal metastases were enrolled. Patients received standard therapy with docetaxel (75 mg/m intravenously every 21 days for at least six cycles) on average 6 weeks after Sm-EDTMP (37 MBq/kg). Patients were monitored for the presence of toxicities, and antitumor efficacy was assessed by changes in serum prostate-specific antigen levels. Besides standard descriptive statistical analysis, progression-free survival and overall survival were defined using the Kaplan-Meier method.  Results:   Over 80% of the patients showed favorable biochemical responses. Median time to progression was 9.1 months (mean 9.8, 95% confidence interval 7.8-9.9), and median overall survival was 19.9 months (mean 24.5, 95% confidence interval 16.9-22.8); five patients were still alive over 5 years after enrollment. No additional hematological toxicities were observed when docetaxel was administered after Sm-EDTMP other than those expected when administering the agent alone.  Conclusion:   Prior administration of Sm-EDTMP does not cause additional toxicities for subsequent treatment with docetaxel and does not reduce the antitumor efficacy of the latter.

The histone deacetylase inhibitor panobinostat has shown significant preclinical and clinical anticancer activity in both hematological and solid malignancies and is currently in phase III trials for relapsed MM. Bisphosphonates (BPs), such as zoledronic acid (ZOL), inhibit osteoclast-mediated bone resorption and are indicated for the treatment of bone metastasis. BPs, including ZOL, have also shown anticancer activity in several preclinical and clinical studies.

The synergistic effect was also observed in an anchorage-independent agar assay in both ZOL-sensitive and ZOL-resistant cells and was confirmed in vivo in a PCa xenograft model. The co-administration of the antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine blocked the increased reactive oxygen species generation and apoptosis observed in the combination setting compared with control or single-agent treatments, suggesting that oxidative injury plays a functional role in the synergism. Proapoptotic synergy was also partially antagonized by the addition of geranyl-geraniol, which bypasses the inhibition of farnesylpyrophosphate synthase by ZOL in the mevalonate pathway, supporting the involvement of this pathway in the synergy.

We have predicted that a fraction of the synthesized serine is routed to a pathway for ATP production. The pathway is composed by reactions from serine synthesis, one-carbon (folate) metabolism and the glycine cleavage system (SOG pathway). Here we show that the SOG pathway is upregulated at the level of gene expression in a subset of human tumors and that its level of expression correlates with gene signatures of cell proliferation and Myc target activation. We have also estimated the SOG pathway metabolic flux in the NCI60 tumor-derived cell lines, using previously reported exchange fluxes and a personalized model of cell metabolism. We find that the estimated rates of reactions in the SOG pathway are highly correlated with the proliferation rates of these cell lines. We also observe that the SOG pathway contributes significantly to the energy requirements of biosynthesis, to the NADPH requirement for fatty acid synthesis and to the synthesis of purines. Finally, when the PC-3 prostate cancer cell line is treated with the antifolate methotrexate, we observe a decrease in the ATP levels, AMP kinase activation and a decrease in ribonucleotides and fatty acids synthesized from [1,2-(13)C2]-D-glucose as the single tracer.

In this study, we investigated the role and association of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), cancer stem cells (CSCs) and the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway in CaP radioresistance. We developed three novel CaP radioresistant (RR) cell lines (PC-3RR, DU145RR and LNCaPRR) by radiation treatment and confirmed their radioresistance using a clonogenic survival assay. Compared with untreated CaP-control cells, the CaP-RR cells had increased colony formation, invasion ability and spheroid formation capability (P<0.05). In addition, enhanced EMT/CSC phenotypes and activation of the checkpoint proteins (Chk1 and Chk2) and the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway proteins were also found in CaP-RR cells using immunofluorescence, western blotting and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Furthermore, combination of a dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor (BEZ235) with RT effectively increased radiosensitivity and induced more apoptosis in CaP-RR cells, concomitantly correlated with the reduced expression of EMT/CSC markers and the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway proteins compared with RT alone. Our findings indicate that CaP radioresistance is associated with EMT and enhanced CSC phenotypes via activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway, and that the combination of BEZ235 with RT is a promising modality to overcome radioresistance in the treatment of CaP.

Foci of atrophy without inflammation (A), atrophy with inflammation (AI), cancer (by patterns), and HGPIN were digitally annotated. Atrophy's proximity to cancer and HGPIN was assessed with two measurements: abutment (touching) or nearness (≤2 μm without touching). Area sums per specimen were computed for A, AI, cancer, and HGPIN. Abutment rates of AI and A foci to cancer were 23% versus 21% (p = NS); for nearness, 29% of AI foci were near to cancer versus 12% of A (P = .0001). Abutment or nearness of A and AI to HGPIN were in the 1.4% to 2.4% range. When A, AI, or HGPIN abutted cancer, it was disproportionately to Gleason grade 3 cancer foci even after adjusting for the lesser frequency of higher-grade cancer foci. Area sums of A, AI, or (A + AI) per specimen showed no correlations with those of HGPIN, and mostly negative ones with area sum and with tumor volume of cancer. In conclusion, atrophy with inflammation showed some preferential spatial association to cancer, although area sums of atrophy with or without inflammation correlated negatively with those of cancer. These divergent spatial associations suggest that atrophy and inflammation in biopsy specimens may have clinical relevance. The frequency of inflammatory atrophy (AI) merging with HGPIN was far less than reported previously, weakening the theory that AI gives rise to HGPIN.""","""['Kenneth A Iczkowski', 'Kathleen C Torkko', 'R Storey Wilson', 'M Scott Lucia', 'David G Bostwick']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Hum Pathol""","""['High-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN) and topographical distribution in 1,374 prostatectomy specimens: existence of HGPIN near prostate cancer.', 'Morphological transition of proliferative inflammatory atrophy to high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia and cancer in human prostate.', 'Alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase (AMACR) expression in normal prostatic glands and high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN): association with diagnosis of prostate cancer.', 'Prostate needle biopsies containing prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia or atypical foci suspicious for carcinoma: implications for patient care.', 'Mechanisms of disease: high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and other proposed preneoplastic lesions in the prostate.', 'Current Status and Future Perspectives of Checkpoint Inhibitor Immunotherapy for Prostate Cancer: A Comprehensive Review.', 'Clinical significance of urine prostatic exosomal protein in the diagnosis of prostate cancer.', 'The combination of histological prostate atrophy and inflammation is associated with lower risk of prostate cancer in biopsy specimens.']"""

Objective:   To estimate the projected budgetary impact of adopting abiraterone for mCRPC patients from a U.S. health plan perspective.  Methods:   A decision analytic model compared mCRPC treatment cost before and after abiraterone acetate adoption based on a hypothetical 1,000,000-member plan. Plan mCRPC prevalence was derived from prostate cancer incidence reported in U.S. epidemiology statistics and disease progression data from published trials. Market shares for comparator mCRPC treatments (prednisone alone; cabazitaxel + prednisone; mitoxantrone + prednisone; docetaxel retreatment + prednisone) were derived from market research simulation. Abiraterone + prednisone uptake (8% - scenario 1 to 55% - scenario 3) was based on assumptions for illustrative purposes. Treatment costs were computed using prescribing information, treatment duration from phase III trials, and drug costs considering common U.S. cost listing and reimbursement schemes. Prevalence and costs of managing treatment-related toxicities were estimated from literature, treatment guidelines, and expert clinical opinion. The model evaluated the perspectives of a commercial payer with no Medicare beneficiaries and a commercial payer with a subset of Medicare beneficiaries. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess changing input values.  Results:   In each modeled scenario, 57 patients with prior docetaxel therapy received treatment for mCRPC. For the commercial perspective, the incremental per-member-per-month (PMPM) cost attributable to abiraterone ranged from $0.0019 in scenario 1 to $0.0133 in scenario 3. For the commercial/Medicare perspective, the incremental PMPM ranged from $0.0026 in scenario 1 to $0.0176 in scenario 3. The average incremental PMPM cost over 3 scenarios is $0.0112. When testing key sensitivity scenarios, the model indicated that abiraterone treatment duration and cabazitaxel market share were the main drivers of cost.  Conclusions:   The model results indicate that reimbursement for abiraterone may have a neutral impact on a U.S. health plan budget given the relatively small size of the eligible prostate cancer population and expected lower toxicity-related costs as compared with chemotherapy.

Patients and methods:   We included prospectively 323 patients who underwent GreenLight® prostate vaporization for prostatic hyperplasia between 2005 and 2013. We excluded patients with prostate cancer and those with concomitant prostate biopsies. Serum PSA levels were measured before and after the procedure at 1, 6, 12, 24, 36, and 48 months.  Results:   The median preoperative PSA level was 4.50 ng/mL; it decreased to 2.41 ng/mL at 1 month (47% reduction), 2.17 ng/mL at 6 months (52% reduction), 2.30 ng/mL at 1 year (49% reduction), 2.40 ng/mL at 2 years (47% reduction), 2.31 ng/mL at 3 years (49% reduction), and 2.54 ng/mL at 4 years (44% reduction) (P values were all <0.0001). The median PSA nadir at 6 months was significantly different from the median PSA level at 1, 2, 3, and 4 years (respectively P=0.0046, P=0.0017, P=0.0006, and P=0.01). Patients who received ≤3000 J/cc had a significant trend to a PSA reascension after 6 months. Patients who received ≥4000 J/cc did not show any significant PSA reascension during the 4 years after procedure. Energy was correlated with the PSA reascension in univariate and multivariate analysis.  Conclusions:   The PSA level significantly decreased by half 1 month after the procedure, reached its nadir at 6 months, and showed a slight progressive reascension during the 4 following years. Applying an energy rate ≥4000 J/cc of prostate induced PSA stability over time whereas energy ≤3000 J/cc induced a reascension of the PSA level after 6 months.""","""['Souhil Lebdai', 'Yohann Prezelin', 'Helder Pereira', 'Franck Bruyere']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Endourol""","""['Assessment of energy density usage during 180W lithium triborate laser photoselective vaporization of the prostate for benign prostatic hyperplasia.

The optimal therapy is unknown but there is evidence that immediate initiation of an effective antineoplastic regimen is important. However, it is difficult to differentiate cancer-associated TMA from primary thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura in a timely manner. We present the first case of cancer-associated TMA in a patient secondary to a locally advanced gallbladder adenocarcinoma that lacked mucinous features and bone marrow involvement.

Methods:   We searched MEDLINE and ClinicalTrials.gov systematically for studies on prostatic, urinary bladder, kidney, and testicular neoplasms. The increase in newly published reports per year was analyzed using linear regression. The results are presented with 95% confidence intervals, and a p value <0.05 was considered statistically significant.  Results:   The number of new publications per year increased significantly for prostatic, kidney and urinary bladder neoplasms (all <0.0001). We identified 1,885 randomized controlled trials (RCTs); also for RCTs, the number of newly published reports increased significantly for prostatic (p = 0.001) and kidney cancer (p = 0.005), but not for bladder (p = 0.09) or testicular (p = 0.44) neoplasms. We identified 3,114 registered uro-oncological studies in ClinicalTrials.gov. However, 85% of these studies are focusing on prostatic (45%) and kidney neoplasms (40%), whereas only 11% were registered for bladder cancers.  Conclusions:   While the number of publications on uro-oncologic research rises yearly for prostatic and kidney neoplasms, urothelial carcinomas of the bladder seem to be neglected despite their important clinical role.

Research design and methods:   Computerized health records from Kaiser Permanente Northern and Southern California regions starting in 2001 and ending in 2009 were used to conduct a population-based cohort study among patients with diabetes aged ≥18 years. With use of Cox regression modeling, cancer risk in users of insulin glargine (n = 27,418) was compared with cancer risk in users of NPH (n = 100,757).  Results:   The cohort had a median follow-up of 3.3 years during which there was a median of 1.2 years of glargine use and 1.4 years of NPH use. Among users of NPH at baseline, there was no clear increase in risk of breast, prostate, colorectal, or all cancers combined associated with switching to glargine. Among those initiating insulin, ever use or ≥2 years of glargine was not associated with increased risk of prostate or colorectal cancer or all cancers combined. Among initiators, the hazard ratio (HR) for breast cancer associated with ever use of glargine was 1.3 (95% CI 1.0-1.8); the HR for breast cancer associated with use of glargine for ≥2 years was 1.6 or 1.7 depending on whether glargine users had also used NPH.

Qigong is a mind-body activity that consists of both physical activity and meditative aspects. This 12-week randomized controlled trial examined the feasibility and efficacy of a Qigong intervention for improving older prostate cancer survivors' levels of fatigue and distress.  Methods:   Forty older (median age = 72, range = 58-93), fatigued (cut-off value of ≥ 1 on the CTCAEv4.0, >20 on a fatigue grading scale), and sedentary (<150 min of moderate exercise/week) prostate cancer survivors were randomized to 12 weeks of Qigong or stretching classes. Primary outcomes were feasibility (i.e., retention and class attendance rates) and fatigue [Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-Fatigue)], and secondary outcome was distress [Brief Symptom Inventory-18 (BSI-18)].  Results:   Study retention rates did not significantly differ between study groups (Qigong = 80 %, stretching = 65 %, p = 0.48). The Qigong group had significantly higher class attendance than the stretching group (p = 0.04). The Qigong group had significantly greater improvements in the FACIT-Fatigue (p = 0.02) and distress (i.e., BSI-18 Somatization, Anxiety, & Global Severity Index, p's < 0.05), than the Stretching group.  Conclusions:   This 12-week Qigong intervention was feasible and potentially efficacious in improving senior prostate cancer survivors' levels of fatigue and distress levels. Future, larger definitive randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm these benefits in older prostate cancer survivors and in racially and ethnically diverse populations.

In multivariate logistic regression analysis, patient age (p = 0.04) and pre-treatment MSEFS (p < 0.001) were predictors of 5-year potency preservation. Neoadjuvant hormone therapy affected potency preservation only at 6 months after brachytherapy.

In this post hoc analysis, the effect of the LFFO intervention on serum pro-inflammatory eicosanoids, leukotriene B4 (LTB4) and 15-S-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid [15(S)-HETE], and the cell-cycle progression (CCP) score were investigated. Serum fatty acids and eicosanoids were measured by gas chromatography and ELISA. CCP score was determined by quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR). Associations between serum eicosanoids, Ki67, and CCP score were evaluated using partial correlation analyses. BLT1 (LTB4 receptor) expression was determined in prostate cancer cell lines and prostatectomy specimens. Serum omega-6 fatty acids and 15(S)-HETE levels were significantly reduced, and serum omega-3 levels were increased in the LFFO group relative to the Western diet group, whereas there was no change in LTB4 levels. The CCP score was significantly lower in the LFFO compared with the Western diet group. The 15(S)-HETE change correlated with tissue Ki67 (R = 0.48; P < 0.01) but not with CCP score. The LTB4 change correlated with the CCP score (r = 0.4; P = 0.02) but not with Ki67. The LTB4 receptor BLT1 was detected in prostate cancer cell lines and human prostate cancer specimens. In conclusion, an LFFO diet resulted in decreased 15(S)-HETE levels and lower CCP score relative to a Western diet.

However, the ERB can exert significant force on the prostate, and this work assessed the impact of ERB position errors on deformation of the prostate and treatment dose metrics. Seventy-one cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) image datasets of nine patients with clinical stage T1cN0M0 prostate cancer were studied. An ERB (Flexi-Cuff, EZ-EM, Westbury, NY) inflated with 60 cm(3) of air was used during simulation and treatment, and daily kilovoltage (kV) CBCT imaging was performed to localize the prostate. The shape of the ERB in each CBCT was analyzed to determine errors in position, size, and shape. A deformable registration algorithm was used to track the dose received by (and deformation of) the prostate, and dosimetric values such as D95, PTV coverage, and Dice coefficient for the prostate were calculated. The average balloon position error was 0.5 cm in the inferior direction, with errors ranging from 2 cm inferiorly to 1 cm superiorly. The prostate was deformed primarily in the AP direction, and tilted primarily in the anterior-posterior/superior-inferior plane. A significant correlation was seen between errors in depth of ERB insertion (DOI) and mean voxel-wise deformation, prostate tilt, Dice coefficient, and planning-to-treatment prostate inter-surface distance (p < 0.001). Dosimetrically, DOI is negatively correlated with prostate D95 and PTV coverage (p < 0.001). For the model of ERB studied, error in ERB position can cause deformations in the prostate that negatively affect treatment, and this additional aspect of setup error should be considered when ERBs are used for prostate SBRT. Before treatment, the ERB position should be verified, and the ERB should be adjusted if the error is observed to exceed tolerable values.""","""['Bernard L Jones', 'Gregory Gan', 'Brian Kavanagh', 'Moyed Miften']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Dosimetric and deformation effects of image-guided interventions during stereotactic body radiation therapy of the prostate using an endorectal balloon.', 'Dosimetric impacts of endorectal balloon in CyberKnife stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for early-stage prostate cancer.', 'Urethra-sparing stereotactic body radiotherapy for prostate cancer: how much can the rectal wall dose be reduced with or without an endorectal balloon?', 'Volumetric-based image guidance is superior to marker-based alignments for stereotactic body radiotherapy of prostate cancer.', 'Daily stereotactic ultrasound prostate targeting: inter-user variability.', 'Extreme Hypofractionation with SBRT in Localized Prostate Cancer.', 'Clinical effects of rectal retractor application in prostate cancer radiotherapy.', 'Spatial and dosimetric evaluation of residual distortions of prostate and seminal vesicle bed after image-guided definitive and postoperative radiotherapy of prostate cancer with endorectal balloon.', 'Effectiveness of rectal displacement devices in managing prostate motion: a\xa0systematic review.', 'Adaptive radiotherapy and the dosimetric impact of inter- and intrafractional motion on the planning target volume for prostate cancer patients.']"""

We hypothesized that sorafenib could overcome chemotherapy resistance in CRPC.  Patients and methods:   Eligible patients were those whose disease had progressed during chemotherapy (docetaxel or mitoxantrone) or within 12 weeks of stopping either. Patients then continued or resumed their last chemotherapy regimen with the addition of sorafenib 400 mg twice daily. Patients received a maximum of 6 cycles of chemotherapy/sorafenib followed by sorafenib alone until disease progression. The primary end point was combination safety. Secondary end points were overall response, percentage of SD, and time to progression (TTP).  Results:   Twenty-two patients (21 evaluable) were enrolled (16 patients with Gleason score ≥ 7). Median age was 68 years (range, 59-83 years). Median prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was 142 ng/dL (range, 13.6-9584). Visceral and bone disease were present combined in 9 patients (41%). Ten patients (47.6%) showed biochemical response (19% with > 50% PSA decline) and 16 patients (76%) achieved radiographic stability (according to Response Evaluation Criteria for Solid Tumors) after starting sorafenib for a median duration of 6 months (range, 4-12 months).

The aim of the present study was to evaluate a schema of stereotactic irradiation of the prostate with an integrated-boost into the tumor.  Material and methods:   The prostate and the tumor were delineated by a radiologist on CT/MRI fusion. A 9-coplanar fields IMRT plan was optimized with three different dose levels: 1) 5 × 6.5 Gy to the PTV1 (plan 1), 2) 5 × 8 Gy to the PTV1 (plan 2) and 3) 5 × 6.5 Gy on the PTV1 with 5 × 8 Gy on the PTV2 (plan 3). The maximum dose (MaxD), mean dose (MD) and doses received by 2% (D2), 5% (D5), 10% (D10) and 25% (D25) of the rectum and bladder walls were used to compare the 3 IMRT plans.  Results:   A dose escalation to entire prostate from 6.5 Gy to 8 Gy increased the rectum MD, MaxD, D2, D5, D10 and D25 by 3.75 Gy, 8.42 Gy, 7.88 Gy, 7.36 Gy, 6.67 Gy and 5.54 Gy. Similar results were observed for the bladder with 1.72 Gy, 8.28 Gy, 7.01 Gy, 5.69 Gy, 4.36 Gy and 2.42 Gy for the same dosimetric parameters. An integrated SBRT boost only to PTV2 reduced by about 50% the dose difference for rectum and bladder compared to a homogenous prostate dose escalation. Thereby, the MD, D2, D5, D10 and D25 for rectum were increased by 1.51 Gy, 4.24 Gy, 3.08 Gy, 2.84 Gy and 2.37 Gy in plan 3 compared to plan 1.

Material and methods:   We perform a prospective evaluation of PCA3 as a second line biomarker in an opportunistic screening for prostate cancer (PCa). From September-2010 until September-2012, 2,366 men, aged 40-74 years and with >10 years life expectancy, were initially screened with PSA/digital rectal examination (DRE). Men with previous Bx or with recent urine infections were excluded. Men with abnormal DRE and/or PSA >3 ng/ml were submitted for PCA3. All men with PCA3 ≥ 35 underwent an initial biopsy (IBx) -12cores-. Men with PCA3 < 35 were randomized 1:1 to either IBx or observation. Re-biopsy(16-18 cores) criteria were PSA increase >.5 ng/ml at 4-6 months or PSAv > .75 ng/ml/year.  Results:   With median follow-up (FU) of 10.1 months, PCA3 was performed in 321/2366 men (13.57%), 289 at first visit and 32 during FU. All 110 PCA3+ men (34.3%) were biopsied and PCa was identified in 43 men in IBx (39.1%). In the randomized arm, 110 were observed and 101 underwent biopsy, finding 12 PCa (11.9%), showing a statistically significant reduction of PCa detection rate in this cohort (P<.001).

Background:   Measuring the capacity of the surgical oncology workforce is difficult due to the wide variety of surgeons who contribute to surgical cancer care. We hypothesize that the bulk of surgical oncology care is provided by general surgeons.  Methods:   Using Medicare claims data linked to the North Carolina Central Cancer Registry, all patients 65 years or older who had a diagnosis of incident cancer of the bladder, breast, colon/rectum, esophagus, gallbladder, kidney, liver, lung, skin (melanoma-only), ovary, pancreas, prostate, small bowel, stomach, or uterus in 2005 and who underwent an extirpative procedure for cancer were identified. The proportion of procedures performed by different types of providers was examined.  Results:   A total of 7759 patients underwent 16,734 extirpative surgical procedures. Excluding procedures for gynecologic/urologic malignancies, the proportion of procedures performed by general surgeons and surgical oncologists was 48% and 12%, respectively. Patients treated by general surgeons were more likely to be older, female, minority, and from areas of high poverty. For each tumor type, travel distances were shorter for patients treated by general surgeons than those treated by specialists.  Conclusions:   Workforce projections must account for the significant overlap in the scope of services delivered by providers of different specialties and for the large contribution of general surgeons to cancer care. Efforts to improve the quality of cancer care need to move beyond centralization and focus on educating the surgeons who are providing the bulk of oncology care.""","""['Karyn B Stitzenberg', 'YunKyung Chang', 'Raphael Louie', 'Jennifer S Groves', 'Danielle Durham', 'Erin F Fraher']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Ann Surg""","""['Projected supply of and demand for oncologists and radiation oncologists through 2025: an aging, better-insured population will result in shortage.', 'Current and future utilization of services from medical oncologists.', 'Surgeons: A Future Role in Clinical Trials?', 'Study of the oncology workforce seeks to determine U.S. cancer care needs for the future.', 'Medical oncology future plan of the Spanish Society of Medical Oncology: challenges and future needs of the Spanish oncologists.', 'Supply and Demand: Is the Surgical Oncology Match in a Bear Market?', 'Workforce Caring for Cancer Survivors in the United States: Estimates and Projections of Use.', 'Troubleshooting Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Breast Cancer Surgery.', 'Biliary fistulas and biliary congestion after hepatopancreaticobiliary surgery.', 'Big data for population-based cancer research: the integrated cancer information and surveillance system.']"""

Objective:   The primary objective was to compare the efficacy of tadalafil 5mg once daily and tadalafil 20mg on demand versus placebo taken over 9 mo in improving unassisted erectile function (EF) following NSRP, as measured by the proportion of patients achieving an International Index of Erectile Function-Erectile Function domain (IIEF-EF) score ≥ 22 after 6-wk drug-free washout (DFW). Secondary measures included IIEF-EF, Sexual Encounter Profile question 3 (SEP-3), and penile length.  Design, setting, and participants:   Randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled trial in men ≤ 68 yr of age with adenocarcinoma of the prostate (Gleason ≤ 7) and normal preoperative EF who underwent NSRP at 50 centres from nine European countries and Canada.  Interventions:   1:1:1 randomisation to 9 mo of treatment with tadalafil 5mg once daily, tadalafil 20mg on demand, or placebo followed by a 6-wk DFW and 3-mo open-label tadalafil once daily (all patients).  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Logistic regression, mixed-effects model for repeated measures, and analysis of covariance, adjusting for treatment, age, and country, were applied to IIEF-EF scores ≥ 22, SEP-3, and penile length.  Results and limitations:   Four hundred twenty-three patients were randomised to tadalafil once daily (n=139), on demand (n=143), and placebo (n=141). The mean age was 57.9 yr of age (standard deviation: 5.58 yr); 20.9%, 16.9%, and 19.1% of patients in the tadalafil once daily, on demand, and placebo groups, respectively, achieved IIEF EF scores ≥ 22 after DFW; odds ratios for tadalafil once daily and on demand versus placebo were 1.1 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.6-2.1; p=0.675) and 0.9 (95% CI, 0.5-1.7; p=0.704). At the end of double-blind treatment (EDT), least squares (LS) mean IIEF-EF score improvement significantly exceeded the minimally clinically important difference (MCID: ΔIIEF-EF ≥ 4) in both tadalafil groups; for SEP-3 (MCID ≥ 23%), this was the case for tadalafil once daily only. Treatment effects versus placebo were significant for tadalafil once daily only (IIEF-EF: p=0.016; SEP-3: p=0.019). In all groups, IIEF-EF and SEP-3 decreased during DFW but continued to improve during open-label treatment. At month 9 (EDT), penile length loss was significantly reduced versus placebo in the tadalafil once daily group only (LS mean difference 4.1mm; 95% CI, 0.4-7.8; p=0.032).  Conclusions:   Tadalafil once daily was most effective on drug-assisted EF in men with erectile dysfunction following NSRP, and data suggest a potential role for tadalafil once daily provided early after surgery in contributing to the recovery of EF after prostatectomy and possibly protecting from penile structural changes.

Such a strategy properly implemented, will decrease the number of negative biopsies for prostate cancer and in turn better balance the risks and morbidity for patients recommended for biopsy. The aim of study is to investigate Doppler spectral waveform parameters of neurovascular bundle (NVB) vessels and determine differences between benign and malignant pathologies.  Patients and methods:   We performed a prospective analysis involving 292 patients who received prostate biopsy for elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) values or abnormal digital rectal examination, as well as 174 patients with symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia. Doppler spectral waveform (DSW) parameters (peak-systolic velocity [PSV], end-diastolic velocity [EDV], and resistive index [RI]) were measured at bilateral NVB vessels through Doppler transrectal ultrasound at the right lateral decubitus position, compared, and analyzed among patients with benign versus malignant histology for each side.  Results:   Overall, both PSV and EDV at malignant sides were significantly higher than those at benign sides, as well as lower RI (all p-values <0.05, unpaired t-test). In subgroup analysis with 93 patients of serum PSA between 10 and 20 ng/mL and 56 patients with one-side malignancy, higher EDV and lower RI were significantly associated with malignancies (all p<0.05). The values of PSV and EDV rather than RI might be influenced by the patients' position and RI by the prostate volume.  Conclusions:   In this study, DSW parameters (mainly EDV and RI) at NVB vessels were significantly associated with prostate cancer, particularly in patients with serum PSA of 10-20 ng/mL. It should be in caution that the patients' position and prostate volume may influence the Doppler signal as demonstrated in the current study. These findings can provide more diagnostic information before prostate biopsy.""","""['Yuh-Shyan Tsai', 'Yeong-Chin Jou', 'Chia-Hong Chen', 'Chien-Chen Chang', 'Wen-Horng Yang', 'Jan-Li Lai', 'Tzong-Shin Tzai']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Endourol""","""['Association of Prostate Blood Flow with Male Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms.', 'Prospective evaluation of prostate with transrectal spectral Doppler with biopsy correlation: a clinicopathologic study.', 'Resistive index of prostatic capsular arteries as a predictor of prostate cancer in patients undergoing initial prostate biopsy.', 'Prospective evaluation of prostate specific antigen and prostate specific antigen density in the detection of nonpalpable and stage T1C carcinoma of the prostate.', 'Incidental carcinoma of the prostate.', 'Longitudinal Changes in U.S. Parameters of Neurovascular Bundles Suggest Mechanism for Radiation-Induced Erectile Dysfunction.', 'Novel methods for mapping the cavernous nerves during radical prostatectomy.']"""

Purpose of this study, therefore, was to determine how surfactant proteins are altered in prostate adenocarcinomas (PCa) and find out any connection exists between their expressions and their staining patterns, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) values, Gleason score, age, tumor volume and tumor, node, metastases (TNM) clinical stage.  Methods:   Thirty-five tissue samples were obtained during radical prostatectomy. All specimens were classified to three groups based on the Gleason score <7, 7 and Gleason score >7. Surfactant proteins' expressions were tested by immunohistochemical and Western blotting methods.  Results:   Immunoreactivity was detected in the cytoplasm from both basal cells and secretory epithelial cells in malignant and non-malignant areas. About 80% of the malignant basal cells were characterized as either weak or strong while non-malignant epithelial cells demonstrated strong immunoreactivity for SP-A. Also malignant (81.8%) and non-malignant cells (90.6%) were characterized as either weak or strong for SP-D. Decrement of SP-A and SP-D immunostaining tended to associate with an increasing Gleason score (p > 0.05, p < 0.05), tumor volume (p < 0.05, p > 0.05) and age (p > 0.05, p > 0.05). There was a strong positive correlation between Gleason score and tumor volume (p < 0.01). Also, either none or weak SP-A and SP-D immunoreactivity was observed specimens with Gleason score 7 or higher. SP-A and SP-D reacted with 34 kDa (SP-A) and 43 kDa (SP-D) immunoreactive single bands were decreased in tumor tissues.

Objectives:   To compare the rates of IHC usage between specialized (genitourinary; [GU]) and nonspecialized (non-GU) pathologists in extended core prostate biopsies (ECPBs) and the effects of diagnosis; and in cancer cases Gleason grade, disease extent, and perineural invasion on the rate.  Design:   Consecutive ECPBs from 2009-2011 were identified and billing data were used to determine the number of biopsies and IHC stains per case. Diagnoses were mapped and in cancer cases, Gleason grade, extent of disease, and perineural invasion were recorded. Pathologists were classified as GU or non-GU on the basis of training and experience.  Results:   A total of 618 ECPBs were included in the study. Genitourinary pathologists ordered significantly fewer IHC tests per case and per biopsy than non-GU pathologists. The rate of ordering was most disparate for biopsies of cancerous and benign lesions. For biopsies of cancerous lesions, high-grade cancer, bilateral disease, and perineural invasion decreased the rate of ordering in both groups. In cancer cases, GU pathologists ordered significantly fewer stain tests for highest Gleason grade of 3 + 3 = 6, for patients with focal disease and for patients with multiple positive bilateral cores. The effect of the various predictors on IHC ordering rates was similar in both groups.

Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) regulate proliferation of cancer cells. In the present study, we evaluated the effect of various PUFAs on the proliferation and survival of human prostate cancer (PC-3) and human prostate epithelial (RWPE-1) cells in vitro.LA, GLA, AA, ALA, EPA and DHA (linoleic acid, gamma-linolenic acid, arachidonic acid, alpha-linolenic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid respectively) when tested at 50, 100, 150, and 200 μM inhibited proliferation of RWPE-1 and PC-3 cells, except that lower concentrations of LA (25 μM) and GLA (5, 10 μM) promoted proliferation. Though all fatty acids tested produced changes in the production of interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), lipoxin A4 and free radical generation by RWPE-1 and PC-3 cells, there were significant differences in their ability to do so. As expected, supplementation of various n-3 and n-6 fatty acids to RWPE-1 and PC-3 cells enhanced the content of the added fatty acids and their long-chain metabolites in these cells. In contrast to previous results, we did not find any direct correlation between inhibition of cell proliferation induced by various fatty acids and free radical generation. These results suggest that polyunsaturated fatty acids suppress proliferation of normal and tumor cells by a variety of mechanisms that may partly depend on the type(s) of cell(s) being tested and the way these fatty acids are handled by the cells. Hence, it is suggested that more deeper and comprehensive studies are needed to understand the actions of fatty acids on the growth of normal and tumor cells.""","""['Hongzhou Meng', 'Yuzhen Shen', 'Junhui Shen', 'Feng Zhou', 'Shengrong Shen', 'Undurti N Das']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Lipids Health Dis""","""['Overexpression and hyperactivity of breast cancer-associated fatty acid synthase (oncogenic antigen-519) is insensitive to normal arachidonic fatty acid-induced suppression in lipogenic tissues but it is selectively inhibited by tumoricidal alpha-linolenic and gamma-linolenic fatty acids: a novel mechanism by which dietary fat can alter mammary tumorigenesis.', 'Arachidonic acid and other unsaturated fatty acids and some of their metabolites function as endogenous antimicrobial molecules: A review.', 'Metabolism of linoleic and alpha-linolenic acids in cultured cardiomyocytes: effect of different N-6 and N-3 fatty acid supplementation.', 'ω6/ω3 Polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementations in renal cell model lead to a particular regulation through lipidome for preserved ω6/ω3 ratios.', 'n-3 Polyunsaturated fatty acids for the management of alcoholic liver disease: A critical review.', 'Preclinical models and evaluation criteria of prostatitis.', 'Novel Formulation of Undecylenic Acid induces Tumor Cell Apoptosis.', 'Antiproliferative Fatty Acids Isolated from the Polypore Fungus Onnia tomentosa.', 'Metabolic pathways enriched according to ERG status are associated with biochemical recurrence in Hispanic/Latino patients with prostate cancer.', 'Interplay between Prostate Cancer and Adipose Microenvironment: A Complex and Flexible Scenario.']"""

Here, we demonstrate that genistein, a soy phytoestrogen binds to both the wild and the Thr877Ala (T877A) mutant types of AR competitively with androgen, nevertheless, it exerts a pleiotropic effect on PCa cell proliferation and AR activity depending on the mutational status of the AR. Genistein inhibited, in a dose-dependent way, cell proliferation and AR nuclear localization and expression in LAPC-4 cells that have wild AR. However, in LNCaP cells that express the T877A mutant AR, genistein induced a biphasic effect where physiological doses (0.5-5 µmol/L) stimulated cell growth and increased AR expression and transcriptional activity, and higher doses induced inhibitory effects. Similar biphasic results were achieved in PC-3 cells transfected with AR mutants; T877A, W741C and H874Y. These findings suggest that genistein, at physiological concentrations, potentially act as an agonist and activate the mutant AR that can be present in advanced PCa after androgen ablation therapy.""","""['Abeer M Mahmoud', 'Tian Zhu', 'Aijaz Parray', 'Hifzur R Siddique', 'Wancai Yang', 'Mohammad Saleem', 'Maarten C Bosland']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Androgen receptor W741C and T877A mutations in AIDL cells, an androgen-independent subline of prostate cancer LNCaP cells.', 'The mutant androgen receptor T877A mediates the proliferative but not the cytotoxic dose-dependent effects of genistein and quercetin on human LNCaP prostate cancer cells.', 'Fulvestrant (ICI 182,780) down-regulates androgen receptor expression and diminishes androgenic responses in LNCaP human prostate cancer cells.', 'Androgen action in the prostate gland.', 'Genistein inhibits human prostate cancer cell detachment, invasion, and metastasis.', 'Evaluation of Anticancer and Cytotoxic Effects of Genistein on PC3 Prostate Cell Line under Three-Dimensional Culture Medium.', 'Genistein: An Integrative Overview of Its Mode of Action, Pharmacological Properties, and Health Benefits.', 'Randomized, Placebo-Controlled Six-Month Intervention Study of Soy Protein Isolate in Men with Biochemical Recurrence after Radical Prostatectomy: A Pilot Study.', 'Natural Compounds in Prostate Cancer Prevention and Treatment: Mechanisms of Action and Molecular Targets.', 'Genistein inhibits proliferation and induces senescence in neonatal mouse pituitary gland explant cultures.']"""

While metastasis is the most common cause of death among PCa patients, no specific markers have been assigned to severity and ethnic biasness of the disease. MicroRNAs represent a promising new class of biomarkers owing to their inherent stability and resilience. In the present study, we investigated potential miRNAs that can be used as biomarkers and/or therapeutic targets and can provide insight into the severity and ethnic biasness of PCa. PCR array was performed in FFPE PCa tissues (5 Caucasian American and 5 African American) and selected differentially expressed miRNAs were validated by qRT-PCR, in 40 (15 CA and 25 AA) paired PCa and adjacent normal tissues. Significantly deregulated miRNAs were also analyzed in urine samples to explore their potential as non-invasive biomarker for PCa. Out of 8 miRNAs selected for validation from PCR array data, miR-205 (p<0.0001), mir-214 (p<0.0001), miR-221(p<0.001) and miR-99b (p<0.0001) were significantly downregulated in PCa tissues. ROC curve shows that all four miRNAs successfully discriminated between PCa and adjacent normal tissues. MiR-99b showed significant down regulation (p<0.01) in AA PCa tissues as compared to CA PCa tissues and might be related to the aggressiveness associated with AA population. In urine, miR-205 (p<0.05) and miR-214 (p<0.05) were significantly downregulated in PCa patients and can discriminate PCa patients from healthy individuals with 89% sensitivity and 80% specificity.

Experimental design:   Studies of bisphosphonates in the three malignancies were identified and SRE data were extracted. Outcomes from the MTC were expressed as the annual SRE rate and as the mean likelihood (probability) ratio for the rate of SREs during treatment with zoledronic acid compared with the other bisphosphonates.  Results:   A total of 17 studies were identified (7 breast, 3 prostate, and 7 multiple myeloma). Data were available for all bisphosphonates in breast cancer; no data were available for ibandronate (oral or i.v.) in prostate cancer or for oral ibandronate in multiple myeloma. The SRE rates in breast cancer were 1.60 for zoledronic acid, 1.67 for oral ibandronate (excess SRE rate, 4%), 1.70 for i.v. ibandronate (6%), 2.07 for pamidronate (29%), and 2.29 for clodronate (42%).

Here, we studied various aspects of model building to improve discriminatory accuracy, as measured by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), including: (1) How well does a one-phase procedure that selects SNPs and estimates odds ratios on the same data perform? (2) How should training data be allocated between SNP selection (Phase 1) and estimation (Phase 2) in a two-phase procedure? (3) Should SNP selection be based on P-value thresholding or ranking P-values? (4) How many SNPs should be selected? and (5) Is multivariate estimation preferred to univariate estimation in the presence of linkage disequilibrium (LD)? We used realistic estimates of the distributions of genetic effect sizes, allele frequencies, and LD patterns based on GWAS data for Crohn's disease and prostate cancer. Theory and simulations were used to estimate AUC. Empirical risk models based on 10,000 cases and controls had considerably lower AUC than theoretically achievable. The most critical aspect of prediction model building was initial SNP selection. The single-phase procedure achieved higher AUC than the two-phase procedure.

The exact paracrine molecular network that is hardwired into the proteome of the endothelial and cancer subpopulations participating in this process remains partially understood.  Methods:   Here, we interrogated the signaling pathways and the molecular functional signatures across the proteome of endothelial cells after interacting with various secretomes produced by androgen-dependent and -independent prostate cancer cells.  Results:   We found the significant overexpression (P < 0.05) of prominent markers of angiogenesis, such as vonWillebrand factor (vWF) (∼ 2.5-fold) and CD31 (∼ 2-fold) in HUVECs stimulated with conditioned media from the androgen-independent prostate cancer cell line PC3. By mining the proteome of PC3 conditioned media, we discovered a signature of chemokine CXC motif ligands (i.e., CXCL3, CXCL5, CXCL6 and CXCL8) that could potentially coordinate increased angiogenesis in androgen-independent prostate cancer and verified their increased expression (P < 0.05) in both in vitro and xenograft models of androgen-independence.

Methods:   From September 2009 to January 2013, 203 consecutive robot-assisted prostatectomies were carried out by the same surgeon. A transperitoneal Montsouris technique was used for all cases, but modified to suit the use of the four-arm DaVinci device. The data were recorded prospectively in our database. Preoperative data were patient's age, body mass index, prostate-specific antigen level, prostate weight, percentage of positive biopsy, clinical stage, and Gleason score. Postoperative data were preservation of the bladder neck and neurovascular bundles (NVB), the presence of extended pelvic lymph-node dissection (ePLND), pathological stage, Gleason score, margin status, blood loss, and operative room times. The CINPT and no-CINPT groups were analysed and compared retrospectively.  Results:   The CINPT rates were 23.2 versus 18.2 % for PSM. CINPT contrary to PSM seemed to be more frequent in low-risk prostate cancer. NVB preservation led to more CINPT (p = 0.01). At the multivariate analysis, only the absence of ePLND significantly affected the CINPT status (p = 0.03) and the absence of CINPT positively affected the PSM rate (p = 0.03).

Methods:   A prospective phase II study enrolled men over 4 years with low-risk PCa and the following characteristics: PSA < 10 ng/mL, Gleason score of 6 (3 + 3) or less, three positive cores or less, and tumor stage T2a or less.

Follow-up included PSA and bioavailable testosterone blood tests every 3 months and yearly surveillance biopsies. Primary end point was the presence of PCa on biopsy at last follow-up. Secondary end points were detailed pathological features and adverse events.  Results:   Overall, 98 men were included and 45 of them (45.9 %) had a negative biopsy after a median follow-up of 13 months [11-19.5].

Methods:   The authors conducted a cost-consequence analysis of navigation versus usual care among 10,521 individuals with abnormal breast, cervical, colorectal, or prostate cancer screening results who enrolled in the Patient Navigation Research Program study from January 1, 2006 to March 31, 2010. Navigation costs included diagnostic evaluation, patient and staff time, materials, and overhead. Consequences or outcomes were time to diagnostic resolution and probability of resolution. Differences in costs and outcomes were evaluated using multilevel, mixed-effects regression modeling adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, language, marital status, insurance status, cancer, and site clustering.  Results:   The majority of individuals were members of a minority (70.7%) and uninsured or publically insured (72.7%). Diagnostic resolution was higher for navigation versus usual care at 180 days (56.2% vs 53.8%; P = .008) and 270 days (70.0% vs 68.2%; P < .001). Although there were no differences in the average number of days to resolution between the 2 groups (110 days vs 109 days; P = .63), the probability of ever having diagnostic resolution was higher for the navigation group versus the usual-care group (84.5% vs 79.6%; P < .001). The added cost of navigation versus usual care was $275 per patient (95% confidence interval, $260-$290; P < .001). There was no significant difference in stage distribution among the 12.4% of patients in the navigation group vs 11% of the usual-care patients diagnosed with cancer.  Conclusions:   Navigation adds costs and modestly increases the probability of diagnostic resolution among patients with abnormal screening test results.

Whole-genome methylation status was determined for iCTCs using the Illumina HumanMethylation27 BeadChip. Thirty-four samples were collected for iCTC analysis. A median of 27 (range 0-800) and 23 (range 2-390) iCTCs/mL were detected by ICC and flow, respectively. In a subset of 20 samples, a median of seven CTCs/mL (range 0-85) were detected by the CellSearch platform compared to 26 by the CAM platform. iCTC clusters were observed in 17% of samples. iCTCs expressing PSMA as well as markers of EMT and stemness were detectable. The iCTC methylation profile highly resembled mCRPC. More CTCs were recovered using the CAM platform than the CellSearch platform, and the CAM platform allowed for the detection of iCTC clusters, iCTCs expressing EMT and stem-cell markers, and characterization of the iCTC methylome.

Using a standardized, national, risk-adjusted surgical database, we compared 30-day outcomes following ORP and LRP and analyzed how trainee involvement influenced outcomes.  Methods:   The American College of Surgeons-National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) is a risk-adjusted data collection analyzing preoperative risk factors, demographics, and 30-day postoperative outcomes. From 2005 to 2011, we identified 10,669 total prostatectomies. Of these, 2278 were ORP and 8391 were LRP. Data on trainee involvement were available on 63% of cases.  Results:   Comparison of all 10,669 prostatectomies showed a decreased incidence of overall morbidity, serious morbidity, surgical site infections, mortality, wound disruption, urinary tract infection, bleeding, and sepsis or septic shock (p<0.05) for LRP compared with ORP. Trainee involvement was associated with a higher incidence of bleeding, overall and serious morbidity (p<0.001). This difference is isolated to postgraduate year (PGY) 6-10 trainees performing ORP (p<0.001). Overall and serious morbidity was equivalent between PGY groups 1-10 versus attending without trainee performing LRP and PGY groups 1-5 versus attending without trainee performing ORP. Operative times were shorter for ORP versus LRP by an average of 38 minutes (p<0.05), and in cases involving trainees, operative times decreased with trainee experience for both procedures. The length of stay was shorter for LRP compared with ORP (3.2 vs. 1.8 days, p<0.001).  Conclusions:   The large sample size, standardized data definitions, and quality control measures of the ACS-NSQIP database allow for in-depth analysis of subtle, but significant differences in outcomes between groups. Trainee involvement in LRP appears safe to patients. However, the increased morbidity in ORP involving trainees may be mitigated by awareness, simulation laboratories, and standardized competency assessment.""","""['Ronald J Caras', 'Michael B Lustik', 'Sean Q Kern', 'Joseph R Sterbis', 'Leah P McMann']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Endourol""","""['Comparison of outcomes after minimally invasive versus open partial nephrectomy with respect to trainee involvement utilizing the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program.', 'Patterns-of-care and health economic analysis of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy in the Australian public health system.', 'Laparoscopic and robot-assisted vs open radical prostatectomy for the treatment of localized prostate cancer: a Cochrane systematic review.', 'Positive surgical margin and perioperative complication rates of primary surgical treatments for prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis comparing retropubic, laparoscopic, and robotic prostatectomy.', 'Comparison of retropubic, laparoscopic and robotic radical prostatectomy: who is the winner?', 'The short term feasibility of abdominoperineal resection with prostatectomy for locally advanced rectal cancer: open and laparoscopic cases report.', 'Facility-level analysis of robot utilization across disciplines in the National Cancer Database.', 'The impact of resident involvement in minimally-invasive urologic oncology procedures.', 'Removal of the primary tumor in hematogenous metastatic tumor disease: reasons against.']"""

For this reason, inhibition of such targets is an exciting avenue for the development of novel therapeutic strategies to treat patients with advanced PCa. Previous reports demonstrated that HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) increases DNA damage and induce greater apoptosis in PCa cell lines that express androgen receptor (AR). In this study we utilized the AR negative PCa cell line and observed that re-expression of AR (PC3-AR) results in greater levels of apoptosis when treated with the pan-DACi, panobinostat (PAN). PAN mediated apoptosis in PC3 and PC3-AR cells was associated with increased levels of double strand DNA breaks, indicated by p-ɣH2AX. Further, PAN treatment in PC3-AR cells resulted in moderate attenuation of the ATM-Akt-ERK DNA damage response pathway. For this reason, we combined PAN with the dual PI3K-mTOR inhibitor, BEZ235. Combination of PAN with BEZ235 resulted in significant attenuation of the DNA damage repair protein ATM and significantly increased anti-tumor activity compared to each single treatment. Overall, superior anti-tumor activity with combination of PAN with BEZ235 was independent of AR status.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation showed that AR binds chromatin regions containing well-characterized cis-elements known to mediate REST transcriptional repression, while cell imaging studies confirmed that REST and AR closely co-localize in vivo. Androgen-induced gene repression also involves modulation of REST protein turnover through actions on the ubiquitin ligase β-TRCP. Androgen deprivation or AR blockage with inhibitor MDV3100 (Enzalutamide) leads to neuroendocrine (NE) differentiation, a phenomenon that is mimicked by REST inactivation. Gene expression profiling revealed that REST not only acts to repress neuronal genes but also genes involved in cell cycle progression, including Aurora Kinase A, that has previously been implicated in the growth of NE-like castration-resistant tumors. The analysis of prostate cancer tissue microarrays revealed that tumors with reduced expression of REST have higher probability of early recurrence, independently of their Gleason score.

How these variants influence risk in familial prostate cancer is not well studied. Here, we analyzed 25 previously reported SNPs across 14 loci from prior prostate cancer GWAS. The International Consortium for Prostate Cancer Genetics (ICPCG) previously validated some of these using a family-based association method (FBAT). However, this approach suffered reduced power due to the conditional statistics implemented in FBAT. Here, we use a case-control design with an empirical analysis strategy to analyze the ICPCG resource for association between these 25 SNPs and familial prostate cancer risk. Fourteen sites contributed 12,506 samples (9,560 prostate cancer cases, 3,368 with aggressive disease, and 2,946 controls from 2,283 pedigrees). We performed association analysis with Genie software which accounts for relationships. We analyzed all familial prostate cancer cases and the subset of aggressive cases. For the familial prostate cancer phenotype, 20 of the 25 SNPs were at least nominally associated with prostate cancer and 16 remained significant after multiple testing correction (p ≤ 1E (-3)) occurring on chromosomal bands 6q25, 7p15, 8q24, 10q11, 11q13, 17q12, 17q24, and Xp11. For aggressive disease, 16 of the SNPs had at least nominal evidence and 8 were statistically significant including 2p15. The results indicate that the majority of common, low-risk alleles identified in GWAS studies for all prostate cancer also contribute risk for familial prostate cancer, and that some may contribute risk to aggressive disease.""","""['Craig C Teerlink', 'Stephen N Thibodeau', 'Shannon K McDonnell', 'Daniel J Schaid', 'Antje Rinckleb', 'Christiane Maier', 'Walther Vogel', 'Geraldine Cancel-Tassin', 'Christophe Egrot', 'Olivier Cussenot', 'William D Foulkes', 'Graham G Giles', 'John L Hopper', 'Gianluca Severi', 'Ros Eeles', 'Douglas Easton', 'Zsofia Kote-Jarai', 'Michelle Guy', 'Kathleen A Cooney', 'Anna M Ray', 'Kimberly A Zuhlke', 'Ethan M Lange', 'Liesel M Fitzgerald', 'Janet L Stanford', 'Elaine A Ostrander', 'Kathleen E Wiley', 'Sarah D Isaacs', 'Patrick C Walsh', 'William B Isaacs', 'Tiina Wahlfors', 'Teuvo Tammela', 'Johanna Schleutker', 'Fredrik Wiklund', 'Henrik Grönberg', 'Monica Emanuelsson', 'John Carpten', 'Joan Bailey-Wilson', 'Alice S Whittemore', 'Ingrid Oakley-Girvan', 'Chih-Lin Hsieh', 'William J Catalona', 'S Lilly Zheng', 'Guangfu Jin', 'Lingyi Lu', 'Jianfeng Xu;International Consortium for Prostate Cancer Genetics;Nicola J Camp', 'Lisa A Cannon-Albright']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Hum Genet""","""['Validation of prostate cancer risk-related loci identified from genome-wide association studies using family-based association analysis: evidence from the International Consortium for Prostate Cancer Genetics (ICPCG).', 'Genome-wide association of familial prostate cancer cases identifies evidence for a rare segregating haplotype at 8q24.21.', 'Replication of the 10q11 and Xp11 prostate cancer risk variants: results from a Utah pedigree-based study.', 'A systematic review of replication studies of prostate cancer susceptibility genetic variants in high-risk men originally identified from genome-wide association studies.', 'An Update on Genetic Predisposition for Prostate Cancer: Perspectives and Prospects.', 'Two-stage Study of Familial Prostate Cancer by Whole-exome Sequencing and Custom Capture Identifies 10 Novel Genes Associated with the Risk of Prostate Cancer.', 'Inflammatory Bowel Disease and the Risk of Prostate Cancer.', 'Admixture Mapping Links RACGAP1 Regulation to Prostate Cancer in African Americans.', 'Systematic identification of functionally relevant risk alleles to stratify aggressive versus indolent prostate cancer.', 'Rare germline mutations in African American men diagnosed with early-onset prostate cancer.']"""

In a randomized, phase 3 trial of 1,776 patients with metastases from solid tumors (except breast or prostate) or multiple myeloma, denosumab was non-inferior to zoledronic acid (ZA) in delaying or preventing SREs. This ad hoc analysis reports outcomes in the subgroup of 1,597 patients with solid tumors, excluding patients with multiple myeloma.  Methods:   Patients received monthly subcutaneous denosumab 120 mg or intravenous ZA 4 mg, adjusted for creatinine clearance, with calcium and vitamin D supplementation recommended. Endpoints included times to first on-study SRE, first-and-subsequent SREs, and pain worsening.  Results:   Denosumab significantly delayed time to first on-study SRE compared with ZA (HR, 0.81; 95 % CI, 0.68-0.96) and time to first-and-subsequent SREs (RR, 0.85; 95 % CI, 0.72-1.00). Denosumab also significantly delayed time to development of moderate or severe pain (HR, 0.81; 95 % CI, 0.66-1.00), pain worsening (HR, 0.83; 95 % CI, 0.71-0.97), and worsening pain interference in patients with no/mild baseline pain (HR, 0.77; 95 % CI, 0.61-0.96). Adverse event rates were 96 % in both groups. Grade 3 or 4 hypocalcemia, mostly without clinical sequelae, was more frequent in denosumab-treated patients (denosumab 4 %, ZA 2 %). Osteonecrosis of the jaw occurred infrequently (denosumab 0.8 %, ZA 1.1 %).

In a quantitative PCR array analysis of 84 Wnt pathway associated genes, both non-canonical and canonical pathways were activated in primary and metastatic tumors relative to normal prostate. Expression of the Wnt target gene PITX2 in a prostate cancer (PCa) bone metastasis was strikingly elevated over normal prostate (over 2,000-fold) and primary prostate cancer (over 200-fold). The elevation of PITX2 protein was also evident on tissue microarrays, with strong PITX2 immunostaining in PCa skeletal and, to a lesser degree, soft tissue metastases. PITX2 is associated with cell migration during normal tissue morphogenesis. In our studies, overexpression of individual PITX2A/B/C isoforms stimulated PC-3 PCa cell motility, with the PITX2A isoform imparting a specific motility advantage in the presence of non-canonical Wnt5a stimulation. Furthermore, PITX2 specific shRNA inhibited PC-3 cell migration toward bone cell derived chemoattractant. These experimental results support a pivotal role of PITX2A and non-canonical Wnt signaling in enhancement of PCa cell motility, suggest PITX2 involvement in homing of PCa to the skeleton, and are consistent with a role for PITX2 in PCa metastasis to soft and bone tissues. Our findings, which significantly expand previous evidence that PITX2 is associated with risk of PCa biochemical recurrence, indicate that variation in PITX2 expression accompanies and may promote prostate tumor progression and metastasis.""","""['I Vela', 'C Morrissey', 'X Zhang', 'S Chen', 'E Corey', 'G M Strutton', 'C C Nelson', 'D L Nicol', 'J A Clements', 'E M Gardiner']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Clin Exp Metastasis""","""['Wnt/β-catenin pathway is regulated by PITX2 homeodomain protein and thus contributes to the proliferation of human ovarian adenocarcinoma cell, SKOV-3.', 'MicroRNA-590-5p functions as a tumor suppressor in breast cancer conferring inhibitory effects on cell migration, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition by downregulating the Wnt-β-catenin signaling pathway.', 'Paired-like Homeodomain Transcription factor 2 expression by breast cancer bone marrow disseminated tumor cells is associated with early recurrent disease development.', 'Ras and Wnt Interaction Contribute in Prostate Cancer Bone Metastasis.', 'The interaction of Wnt-11 and signalling cascades in prostate cancer.', 'Comparison between Cultivated Oral Mucosa and Ocular Surface Epithelia for COMET Patients Follow-Up.', 'Bioengineered BERA-Wnt5a siRNA Targeting Wnt5a/FZD2 Signaling Suppresses Advanced Prostate Cancer Tumor Growth and Enhances Enzalutamide Treatment.', 'PITX2C increases the stemness features of hepatocellular carcinoma cells by up-regulating key developmental factors in liver progenitor.', 'Teaching an old dog new tricks: reactivated developmental signaling pathways regulate ABCB1 and chemoresistance in cancer.', 'Downregulation of PITX2 inhibits the proliferation and migration of liver cancer cells and induces cell apoptosis.']"""

The innovative electronic Patient-reported Outcomes from Cancer Survivors (ePOCS) system was developed to integrate PROs, collected online at specified post-diagnostic time-points, with clinical and treatment data in cancer registries.  Objective:   This study tested the technical and clinical feasibility of ePOCS by running the system with a sample of potentially curable breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer patients in their first 15 months post diagnosis.  Methods:   Patients completed questionnaires comprising multiple Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) via ePOCS within 6 months (T1), and at 9 (T2) and 15 (T3) months, post diagnosis. Feasibility outcomes included system informatics performance, patient recruitment, retention, representativeness and questionnaire completion (response rate), patient feedback, and administration burden involved in running the system.  Results:   ePOCS ran efficiently with few technical problems. Patient participation was 55.21% (636/1152) overall, although varied by approach mode, and was considerably higher among patients approached face-to-face (61.4%, 490/798) than by telephone (48.8%, 21/43) or letter (41.0%, 125/305). Older and less affluent patients were less likely to join (both P<.001). Most non-consenters (71.1%, 234/329) cited information technology reasons (ie, difficulty using a computer). Questionnaires were fully or partially completed by 85.1% (541/636) of invited participants at T1 (80 questions total), 70.0% (442/631) at T2 (102-108 questions), and 66.3% (414/624) at T3 (148-154 questions), and fully completed at all three time-points by 57.6% (344/597) of participants. Reminders (mainly via email) effectively prompted responses. The PROs were successfully linked with cancer registry data for 100% of patients (N=636). Participant feedback was encouraging and positive, with most patients reporting that they found ePOCS easy to use and that, if asked, they would continue using the system long-term (86.2%, 361/419). ePOCS was not administratively burdensome to run day-to-day, and patient-initiated inquiries averaged just 11 inquiries per month.  Conclusions:   The informatics underlying the ePOCS system demonstrated successful proof-of-concept--the system successfully linked PROs with registry data for 100% of the patients. The majority of patients were keen to engage. Participation rates are likely to improve as the Internet becomes more universally adopted. ePOCS can help overcome the challenges of routinely collecting PROs and linking with clinical data, which is integral for treatment and supportive care planning and for targeting service provision.""","""['Laura Ashley', 'Helen Jones', 'James Thomas', 'Alex Newsham', 'Amy Downing', 'Eva Morris', 'Julia Brown', 'Galina Velikova', 'David Forman', 'Penny Wright']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Med Internet Res""","""['Feasibility test of a UK-scalable electronic system for regular collection of patient-reported outcome measures and linkage with clinical cancer registry data: the electronic Patient-reported Outcomes from Cancer Survivors (ePOCS) system.', ""Integrating cancer survivors' experiences into UK cancer registries: design and development of the ePOCS system (electronic Patient-reported Outcomes from Cancer Survivors)."", 'Feasibility of collecting patient-generated health data to enhance cancer registry surveillance.', 'A review of the barriers to using Patient-Reported Outcomes (PROs) and Patient-Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) in routine cancer care.', 'Incorporating patient-reported outcomes in total joint arthroplasty registries: challenges and opportunities.', 'Assessing the feasibility of a web-based outcome measurement system in child and adolescent mental health services - myHealthE a randomised controlled feasibility pilot study.', 'Barriers and Opportunities for Patient-Reported Outcome Implementation: A National Pediatrician Survey in the United States.', 'Quality of life from cytoreductive surgery in advanced ovarian cancer: Investigating the association between disease burden and surgical complexity in the international, prospective, SOCQER-2 cohort study.', 'The role of kidney registries in expediting large-scale collection of patient-reported outcome measures for people with chronic kidney disease.', 'Acceptance and Use of Home-Based Electronic Symptom Self-Reporting Systems in Patients With Cancer: Systematic Review.']"""

Design:   Descriptive-exploratory; community-based study.  Setting:   Telephone interviews.  Sample:   95 female spouses of men treated for early-stage prostate cancer.  Methods:   A computer-assisted telephone interview was used to evaluate QOL among spouses of prostate cancer survivors at 36 months after initial prostate cancer treatment.  Main research variables:   Lymphedema, demographic information, self-reported comorbid diseases or medical issues, and medication usage.  Findings:   Spouses who had more negative appraisal of caregiving had lower sexual satisfaction, poorer cancer-specific QOL, and poorer mental QOL. Spouses who perceived bother related to the patient's sexual or hormone function reported more threatening appraisals of caregiving, less sexual satisfaction, and poorer QOL.  Conclusions:   Spouses continued to experience negative appraisal of caregiving, which affected QOL 36 months after their husbands' treatment for prostate cancer. Additional studies related to factors that influence spouse QOL during survivorship will help guide clinical practice.  Implications for nursing:   Healthcare providers must help spouses find strategies that promote positive coping and lessen negative appraisal. Giving caregivers information early in the treatment process will help them understand what to expect over time. Supporting caregivers and helping them manage stress will enhance QOL during survivorship.  Knowledge translation:   Spouses who experienced more bother related to urinary, sexual, and hormonal function experience more stress and worse QOL at 36 months post-treatment. Spouse appraisal can have a significant effect on QOL.

Methods and materials:   We assessed HT in 141 patients who received P-IMRT for anal, gynecologic, rectal, or prostate cancers, 95 of whom received concurrent chemotherapy. Patients were separated into 4 groups: mitomycin (MMC) + 5-fluorouracil (5FU, 37 of 141), platinum ± 5FU (Cis, 32 of 141), 5FU (26 of 141), and P-IMRT alone (46 of 141). The pelvic bone was contoured as a surrogate for pelvic bone marrow (PBM) and divided into subsites: ilium, lower pelvis, and lumbosacral spine (LSS). The volumes of each region receiving 5-40 Gy were calculated. The endpoint for HT was grade ≥3 (HT3+) leukopenia, neutropenia or thrombocytopenia. Normal tissue complication probability was calculated using the Lyman-Kutcher-Burman model. Logistic regression was used to analyze association between HT3+ and dosimetric parameters.  Results:   Twenty-six patients experienced HT3+: 10 of 37 (27%) MMC, 14 of 32 (44%) Cis, 2 of 26 (8%) 5FU, and 0 of 46 P-IMRT. PBM dosimetric parameters were correlated with HT3+ in the MMC group but not in the Cis group. LSS dosimetric parameters were well correlated with HT3+ in both the MMC and Cis groups. Constrained optimization (0<n≤ 1) of the Lyman-Kutcher-Burman model resulted in n=1, m = 0.11, TD50 = 31 Gy for LSS in the MMC group and n=1, m = 0.27, TD50 = 35 Gy for LSS in the Cis group.  Conclusions:   The incidence of HT3+ depends on type of chemotherapy received. Patients receiving P-IMRT ± 5FU have better bone marrow tolerance than those receiving irradiation concurrent with either Cis or MMC. Treatment with MMC has a lower TD50 and more steeply rising normal tissue complication probability curve compared with treatment with Cis.

The protein has been recently reported to influence the migration and invasiveness of prostate cancer cells. The present study aimed to investigate the influence of TGase-4 on cell-matrix adhesion and search for the candidate active domain[s] within the protein.  Methods:   Human prostate cancer cell lines and prostate tissues were used. Plasmids that encoded different domains and full length of TGase-4 were constructed and used to generate sublines that expressed different domains. The impact of TGase-4 on in vitro cell-matrix adhesion, cell migration, growth and in vivo growth were investigated. Interactions between TGase-4 and focal adhesion complex proteins were investigated using immunoprecipitation, immunofluorescence and phosphospecific antibodies.  Results:   TGase-4 markedly increased cell-matrix adhesion and cellular migration, and resulted in a rapid growth of prostate tumours in vivo. This effect resided in the Core-domain of the TGase-4 protein. TGase-4 was found to co-precipitate and co-localise with focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and paxillin, in cells, human prostate tissues and tumour xenografts.

The results presented in this study describe the potential efficacy of 66γCD2su and 66γCD2ur for intracellular curcumin delivery to cancer cells. Cellular viability assays demonstrated a dose-dependent antiproliferative effect of curcumin in human prostate cancer (PC-3) cells that was preserved by the curcumin-66γCD2su complex. In contrast, delivery of curcumin by 66γCD2ur significantly delayed the antiproliferative effect. We observed similar patterns of gene regulation in PC-3 cells for curcumin complexed with either 66γCD2su or 66γCD2ur in comparison to curcumin alone, although curcumin delivered by either 66γCD2su or 66γCD2ur induces a slightly higher up-regulation of heme oxygenase-1. Highlighting their nontoxic nature, neither 66γCD2su nor 66γCD2ur carriers alone had any measurable effect on cell proliferation or candidate gene expression in PC-3 cells. Finally, confocal fluorescence imaging and uptake studies were used to demonstrate the intracellular delivery of curcumin by 66γCD2su and 66γCD2ur.

Moreover, histological analysis indicated that the DUPA-targeted DTX conjugate with longer spacer had no toxicity in major organs of treated mice.""","""['Zheng-Hong Peng', 'Monika Sima', 'Mohamed E Salama', 'Pavla Kopečková', 'Jindřich Kopeček']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Drug Target""","""['Prostate-cancer-targeted N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide copolymer/docetaxel conjugates.', 'Comparison of active and passive targeting of docetaxel for prostate cancer therapy by HPMA copolymer-RGDfK conjugates.', 'Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen Targeted Therapy of Prostate Cancer Using a DUPA-Paclitaxel Conjugate.', 'HPMA copolymer-cyclic RGD conjugates for tumor targeting.', 'PSMA-targeted low-molecular double conjugates for diagnostics and therapy.', 'Reports of Plant-Derived Nanoparticles for Prostate Cancer Therapy.', 'Optimisation of Folate-Mediated Liposomal Encapsulated Arsenic Trioxide for Treating HPV-Positive Cervical Cancer Cells In Vitro.', 'Backbone Degradable N-(2-Hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide Copolymer Conjugates with Gemcitabine and Paclitaxel: Impact of Molecular Weight on Activity toward Human Ovarian Carcinoma Xenografts.', 'PSMA-targeted contrast agents for intraoperative imaging of prostate cancer.', 'The therapeutic and diagnostic potential of the prostate specific membrane antigen/glutamate carboxypeptidase II (PSMA/GCPII) in cancer and neurological disease.']"""

Dosimetric data were collected and acute and sub-acute toxicities of the upper abdominal organs at risk (OAR) were evaluated.  Methods:   Twenty-nine patients suitable for EF irradiation for local disease and/or nodal disease in the pelvic or para-aortic area were treated. The prescription dose was 50.4/54 Gy (1.7-1.8 Gy/fraction) for prophylactic lymph nodes (N-) and 60-70.5 Gy (2-2.35 Gy/fraction) for clinically evident gross disease (N+). Modulation factor (MF), pitch and field width (FW) were chosen to optimize dose distribution and treatment duration. Dose values of PTVs and OAR were analysed. The length of the treatment field, the N + and N- volumes, and treatment duration were reported. To evaluate the safety of treatment, haematological, hepatic, renal and pancreatic functions were assessed before, during and after treatment. The median follow-up time was 17.6 months (range: 6-22 months).  Results:   The treatment was well tolerated and all patients but one completed treatment without interruption. Four of the 29 patients experienced G3 haematological acute toxicity (13.8%), but no patient experienced sub-acute grade G3 toxicity. Ten patients experienced G1 and three G2 acute gastrointestinal toxicity (nausea). No sub-acute gastrointestinal or renal toxicity was observed. Only one (3.7%) patient had a persistent slight increase of pancreatic enzymes and two (7.4%) patients a slight increase of hepatic enzymes six months after radiotherapy (G1 toxicity).  Conclusions:   With our treatment design and dose regimen, we found that EF treatment by TomoTherapy could be safely and effectively delivered with minimal acute and sub-acute toxicities in the upper abdomen area.""","""['Sara Bresciani', 'Elisabetta Garibaldi', 'Gabriella Cattari', 'Angelo Maggio', 'Amalia Di Dia', 'Elena Delmastro', 'Domenico Gabriele', 'Michele Stasi', 'Pietro Gabriele']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Radiat Oncol""","""['Toxicity and early clinical outcomes in cervical cancer following extended field helical tomotherapy to para-aortic lymph nodes.', 'Duodenal and other gastrointestinal toxicity in cervical and endometrial cancer treated with extended-field intensity modulated radiation therapy to paraaortic lymph nodes.', 'Pelvic nodal dose escalation with prostate hypofractionation using conformal avoidance defined (H-CAD) intensity modulated radiation therapy.', 'Preliminary results of whole breast helical tomotherapy with simultaneous integrated boost in the adjuvant treatment of breast cancer.', 'Helical tomotherapy for the treatment of anal canal cancer: a dosimetric comparison with 3D conformal radiotherapy.', 'Adaptive Tomotherapy for locally advanced unresectable pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor: Case report and literature review.', 'First-in-human dosimetry of gastrin-releasing peptide receptor antagonist 177LuLu-RM2: a radiopharmaceutical for the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Is there still a role for computed tomography and bone scintigraphy in prostate cancer staging?

They frequently have been used for diagnostic and prognostic cancer studies. For fluorescence based analysis, lectins commonly are conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate (Con A-FITC); however, this molecule loses its fluorescence quickly. We conjugated Europium cryptate to Con A (Con A-cryp-Eu) for use as a histochemical luminescent probe to recognize glucose/mannose residues in benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostatic carcinoma tissues, and used confocal microscopy instead of commercial Con A-FITC. Tissues were treated with Evans blue to suppress intrinsic tissue fluorescence before incubation with Con A-cryp-Eu or Con A-FITC. Con A-cryp-Eu exhibited hemagglutinating activity. Con A-cryp-Eu showed the same binding pattern as Con A-FITC in prostate stroma and gland cells. Staining was strong in benign prostate hyperplasia and prostate carcinoma tissues. Con A-cryp-Eu probe stained glucose/mannose residues in prostatic carcinoma more intensely than Con A-FITC. Furthermore, staining with Con A-cryp-Eu showed greater fluorescence intensity than Con A-FITC and the emission of Con A-cryp-Eu was more stable than the Con A-FITC for seven days under the same storage conditions. Maintenance of the luminescent properties and the binding pattern of Con A-cryp-Eu favor its use as an auxiliary histochemistry probe for prostatic tissue studies.""","""['M J B M Rêgo', 'L P B G Silva', 'J K G Medeiros', 'R C B Q Figueiredo', 'S Alves-Júnior', 'E I C Beltrão']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Biotech Histochem""","""['Folic acid-conjugated europium complexes as luminescent probes for selective targeting of cancer cells.', 'Histochemical evaluation of human prostatic tissues with Cratylia mollis seed lectin.', 'A highly sensitive luminescent lectin sensor based on an α-D-mannose substituted Tb3+ antenna complex.', 'Dimethyl-2-(acridin-9-yl)methylidene-malonate as fluorescent probe for histochemical analysis.', 'Histochemical studies of epithelial cell glycoconjugates in atrophic, metaplastic, hyperplastic, and neoplastic canine prostate.']"""
