The cytotoxic effects of AexU either alone or in combination with chemotherapeutic agents were evaluated using several human prostate cancer cell lines. Human prostate cancer PC3 cells, in which an expression vector containing siRNA targeting β4-integrin had been introduced, were established (PC3/sh-In), and the cytotoxic effects of AexU on the PC3/sh-In cells were compared with the PC3 cells that were transfected with a control vector (PC3/C). The expression levels of β4-integrin in the PC3 cells were markedly higher compared with those in the LNCaP or DU145 cells, and the cytotoxic effects of AexU in the PC3 cells were more pronounced compared with those in the LNCaP or DU145 cells. The sensitivity of the PC3 cells to docetaxel and cisplatin was significantly enhanced following treatment with AexU, resulting in a decrease in the IC50 of the two agents by ~90%. The cytotoxic effect of AexU in the PC3/C cells was more marked compared with that in the PC3/sh-In cells, and the phosphorylation of Akt in the PC3/C cells appeared to be significantly more inhibited by the treatment with AexU compared with the PC3/sh-In cells. In conclusion, treatment with AexU may be a useful therapeutic option for prostate cancer when β4-integrin is overexpressed. The treatment appears to exert its effects through growth inhibition and by enhancing the sensitivity of the cancer cells to chemotherapeutic agents.""","""['Masafumi Kumano', 'Hideaki Miyake', 'Said K Abolghait', 'Hosny M Behnsawy', 'Masato Fujisawa']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Oncol Lett""","""['Recombinant AexU effector protein of Aeromonas veronii bv. sobria disrupts the actin cytoskeleton by downregulation of Rac1 and induces direct cytotoxicity to β4-integrin expressing cell lines.', 'Inhibition of tumor growth and sensitization to chemotherapy by RNA interference targeting interleukin-6 in the androgen-independent human prostate cancer PC3 model.', 'Suppressed tumour growth and enhanced chemosensitivity by RNA interference targeting Aurora-A in the PC3 human prostate cancer model.', 'Molecular Mechanism Mediating Cytotoxic Activity of Cabazitaxel in Docetaxel-resistant Human Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Reduced pim-1 expression increases chemotherapeutic drug sensitivity in human androgen-independent prostate cancer cells by inducing apoptosis.']"""

This adhesion is enabled by elevated expression of α-1,3-fucosyltransferases (FTs), enzymes responsible for ESL-mediated bone metastasis in humans. In contrast, the incidence of bone metastasis in mice is rare.  Methods:   FT 3, 6 and 7 were overexpressed in mouse PCa cells. The rolling cell number, cell-rolling velocity and transendothelial migration were characterised in vitro. Fucosyltransferases-transduced mouse PCa cells expressing luciferase were inoculated into mice via left ventricle to compare the capability of bone metastasis. Mass spectrometry and immunoprecipitation were utilised for identification of ESLs.  Results:   Overexpression of FT3, FT6 or FT7 restored ESLs and enabled mouse PCa cells to roll and adhere in E-selectin-functionalised microtubes, similar to trafficking of circulating PCa cells in BM vessels. Following intracardiac inoculation, FT6-transduced cells induced robust bone metastasis in mice. Inhibition of FT6 by a fucose mimetic significantly reduced bone metastasis. Importantly, comparison of FT3, FT6 and FT7 gene expression in existing clinical samples showed significant upregulation of FT6 in PCa-distant metastases.  Conclusion:   FT6 is a key mediator of PCa cells trafficking to the BM. It may serve as a viable drug target in preclinical tests of therapeutics for reduction of PCa bone metastasis.""","""['J Li', 'A D Guillebon', 'J-w Hsu', 'S R Barthel', 'C J Dimitroff', 'Y-F Lee', 'M R King']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Br J Cancer""","""['Alpha 1,3 fucosyltransferases are master regulators of prostate cancer cell trafficking.', 'Analysis of glycosyltransferase expression in metastatic prostate cancer cells capable of rolling activity on microvascular endothelial (E)-selectin.', 'E-selectin ligand-1 controls circulating prostate cancer cell rolling/adhesion and metastasis.', 'Animal models of bone metastasis.', 'Molecular mechanisms of metastasis in prostate cancer.', 'Elevation of α-1,3 fucosylation promotes the binding ability of TNFR1 to TNF-α and contributes to osteoarthritic cartilage destruction and apoptosis.', 'Altered mRNA Expression of Fucosyltransferases and Fucosidase Predicts Prognosis in Human Oral Carcinoma.', 'Glycosylation: Rising Potential for Prostate Cancer Evaluation.', 'Major differences in glycosylation and fucosyltransferase expression in low-grade versus high-grade bladder cancer cell lines.', 'Mass Spectrometry-Based Glycoproteomics and Prostate Cancer.']"""

This study examines the importance of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A2 (EIF5A2) in melanoma pathogenesis.  Methods:   We examined EIF5A2 expression in 459 melanocytic lesions using tissue microarray. In addition, melanoma cell lines were subjected to invasion and cell proliferation assays, zymography, FACS and real-time PCR to investigate the role of EIF5A2 in cancer progression.  Results:   Positive EIF5A2 staining increased from dysplastic naevi to primary melanomas (PMs; P=0.001), and further increased in metastatic melanomas (P=0.044). Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A2 expression was correlated with melanoma thickness (P<0.001) and was inversely correlated with the 5-year survival of PM patients especially those with tumour ≤2 mm thick. Strikingly, none of the latter died within 5 years in EIF5A2-negative staining group. Cox regression analysis revealed that EIF5A2 is an independent prognostic marker. Further, we found that EIF5A2 is a novel downstream target of phosphorylated Akt. Both melanoma cell invasion and MMP-2 activity increased and decreased with EIF5A2 overexpression and knockdown, respectively.  Conclusion:   We for the first time showed that EIF5A2, as a target of PI3K/Akt, promotes melanoma cell invasion and may serve as a promising prognostic marker and a potential therapeutic target for melanoma.""","""['S Khosravi', 'R P C Wong', 'G S Ardekani', 'G Zhang', 'M Martinka', 'C J Ong', 'G Li']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Br J Cancer""","""['Long non-coding RNA LINC00520 promotes the proliferation and metastasis of malignant melanoma by inducing the miR-125b-5p/EIF5A2 axis.', 'LINC00518 affects the proliferation, invasion and migration of cutaneous malignant melanoma cells via miR-526b-3p/EIF5A2 axis.', 'Overexpression of eukaryotic initiation factor 5A2 (EIF5A2) is associated with cancer progression and poor prognosis in patients with early-stage cervical cancer.', 'Roles of eukaryotic initiation factor 5A2 in human cancer.', 'Current status of diagnostic and prognostic markers in melanoma.', 'A functional analysis of 180 cancer cell lines reveals conserved intrinsic metabolic programs.', 'Localization and Functional Roles of Components of the Translation Apparatus in the Eukaryotic Cell Nucleus.', 'The Functional Role of Long Non-Coding RNAs in Melanoma.', 'Knockdown of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A2 enhances the therapeutic efficiency of doxorubicin in hepatocellular carcinoma cells by triggering lethal autophagy.', 'Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A in the pathogenesis of cancers.']"""

However, its specificity is low in patients with a PSA level ranging from 4.0 to 10.0 ng/ml. This study aims to define the correlation between intravesical prostatic protrusion (IPP) and PSA and to establish a new model to predict PCa. A total of 339 patients order than 45 years examined between October 2010 and June 2012 were enrolled. Eligible patients were recommended for transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS)-guided prostate biopsies after measuring total prostate volume (TPV), tranzisional zone volume (TZV) and IPP. The levels of total PSA (tPSA), free PSA (fPSA) were analyzed by using Hybritech calibrated Access tPSA and fPSA assays. A new mathematical model, named IPP removed PCa predicting score (IRPPS), consists of tPSA, TZV and IPP was established. The predictive accuracy of IRPPS, PSA density (PSAD), %PSA and tPSA were compared using receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) analysis. Eighty-six patients had PSA levels of 4.0-10.0 ng/ml. Twenty of them were diagnosed as PCa. Using ROC curves, the areas under the curve for IRPPS, PSAD and %PSA and tPSA were 0.786, 0.768 and 0.664 and 0.585, respectively.

Methods:   A cross-sectional observational study utilized two generic HRQoL instruments, the 15D and the EQ-5D, and a cancer-specific instrument, the EORTC QLQ-C30. Patients were recruited from the Helsinki University Hospital's Department of Oncology and from a local hospice.  Results:   Of the 114 palliative care patients included in the analysis, 27 had breast cancer, 30 had prostate cancer, and 57 had colorectal cancer.

We developed a census tract-based composite SES index to be released in place of individual census tracts to minimize the risk of disclosure.  Methods:   Two SES indices based on the measures identified in the literature were constructed using factor analysis. The analyses were repeated using the data from the 2000 decennial census and 2005-2009 American Community Survey to create the indices at two time points, which were linked to 2000-2009 Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registry data to estimate incidence and survival rates.  Results:   The two indices performed similarly in stratifying census tracts and detecting socioeconomic gradients in cancer incidence and survival. The gradient in the incidence is positive for breast and prostate, and negative for lung cancers, in all races, although the level varies. The positive gradient in survival is more salient for regional-staged breast, colorectal, and lung cancers.

Patients with and without colon cancer were tested for differences in their fatty stores composition.  Methods:   The fatty acid levels were determined by gas-liquid chromatography in adipose tissue samples, subcutaneous and visceral, obtained intra-operatively from 52 colon cancer and 50 nonneoplastic abdominal disease patients. Statistical analysis was performed using one-way ANOVA, SNK test and Dunnet test. Differences in the composition of saturated, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids, in visceral and in subcutaneous samples of colon cancer and nonneoplastic patients, were assessed.  Results:   The sum of saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids, respectively, in visceral and in subcutaneous samples, was higher in neoplastic patients (p < 0.001).

Some studies have proposed that cell signaling pathways might play a key role in the development and progression of PCa. According to our previous study, the RTK/ERK pathway containing nearly 40 genes was associated with PCa risk. On the basis of these genes, we conducted a meta-analysis with our own Chinese Consortium for Prostate Cancer Genetics (ChinaPCa) study and available studies in the databases to describe the association between the pathway and PCa on the SNP level.

Cell adhesion to endothelial cell monolayers and differentiation into prostate cancer cells were evaluated. α1, β1 and α2β1 integrins adhesion receptors and the downstream target of atorvastatin Rho-dependent kinase (ROCK) and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) were analyzed by Western blot. Further blocking studies with the ROCK inhibitor H1152, anti-FAK antibody and anti-integrin α1 and β1 antibodies were carried out. Atorvastatin treatment inhibited dose-dependently cell attachment to endothelium and differentiation. The inhibitory effect of atorvastatin on cell adhesion was associated with decreased expression of integrins α1 and β1 and phosphorylated MYPT1 and FAK. Furthermore, atorvastatin strongly reduced ROCK1 and FAK mediated differentiation of CD133(+)CD44(+) cells, which was confirmed by antibody treatment. Atorvastatin modified the expression of cell adhesion molecules and differentiation markers. These beneficial effects of atorvastatin may be mediated by ROCK and FAK signaling pathway. The data presented may point to novel treatment options for prostate cancer.""","""['Satyanarayana Rentala', 'Ramakrishna Chintala', 'Manohar Guda', 'Madhuri Chintala', 'Aruna Lakshmi Komarraju', 'Lakshmi Narasu Mangamoori']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Biochem Biophys Res Commun""","""['Simvastatin modulates the adhesion and growth of hepatocellular carcinoma cells via decrease of integrin expression and ROCK.', 'Atorvastatin attenuates remnant lipoprotein-induced monocyte adhesion to vascular endothelium under flow conditions.', 'Statins regulate alpha2beta1-integrin expression and collagen I-dependent functions in human vascular smooth muscle cells.', 'Focal adhesion kinase controls prostate cancer progression via intrinsic kinase and scaffolding functions.', 'Prostate stem cells: an update.', 'L1CAM deployed perivascular tumor niche promotes vessel wall invasion of tumor thrombus and metastasis of renal cell carcinoma.', 'Atorvastatin regulates the migration and invasion of prostate cancer through the epithelial-mesenchymal transformation and matrix metalloproteinase pathways.', 'Inhibiting Airway Smooth Muscle Contraction Using Pitavastatin: A Role for the Mevalonate Pathway in Regulating Cytoskeletal Proteins.', 'Baseline circulating stem-like cells predict survival in patients with metastatic breast Cancer.', 'The Prognostic Roles of Pretreatment Circulating Tumor Cells, Circulating Cancer Stem-Like Cells, and Programmed Cell Death-1 Expression on Peripheral Lymphocytes in Patients with Initially Unresectable, Recurrent or Metastatic Head and Neck Cancer: An Exploratory Study of Three Biomarkers in One-time Blood Drawing.']"""

Materials and methods:   We identified 15 HIV-positive patients with prostate cancer who were treated with external beam radiation to a dose ≥ 75.6 Gy at the New York Harbor Department of Veterans Affairs between 2003 and 2010. Kaplan-Meier analyses were used to measure biochemical control outcomes. Toxicity and CD4 counts before, after, and during treatments were analyzed.  Results:   A total of 15 patients were identified, with a median follow-up period of 49 months. There were 2 biochemical failures, which occurred at 28 months and 63 months, respectively. In neither of these 2 patients was there evidence of metastatic disease. The overall 5-year biochemical control was 92.3%. There appeared to be a consistent decline in the CD4 counts both during and immediately after the radiation treatments. Most of these patients had a subsequent improvement in their CD4 counts. Toxicity was mild overall, though there was 1 patient who developed rectal bleeding 11 months post treatment, which required argon plasma coagulation.  Conclusion:   Dose-escalated external beam radiation is well tolerated in HIV-positive patients with durable biochemical control and mild toxicity. A substantial decline in CD4 counts is associated with the radiation; therefore, these counts need to be monitored closely, in conjunction with the infectious-disease specialist.""","""['David Schreiber', 'Arpit Chhabra', 'Justin Rineer', 'Thomas Nabhani', 'Evangelia Katsoulakis', 'Ramez Morkos', 'Marvin Rotman', 'David Schwartz']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Clin Genitourin Cancer""","""['Long term results of a prospective dose escalation phase-II trial: interstitial pulsed-dose-rate brachytherapy as boost for intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer.', 'Radiation therapy for clinically localized prostate cancer: long-term results of 469 patients from a single institution in the era of dose escalation.', 'Matched cohort analysis of outcomes of definitive radiotherapy for prostate cancer in human immunodeficiency virus-positive patients.', 'Improved biochemical disease-free survival of men younger than 60 years with prostate cancer treated with high dose conformal external beam radiotherapy.', 'Dose escalated external beam radiotherapy versus neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy and conventional dose external beam radiotherapy for clinically localized prostate cancer: do we need both?', 'Prostate Cancer Outcomes in Patients Living With HIV/AIDS Treated With Radiation Therapy: A Systematic Review.', 'Clinical management and outcomes of HIV-positive patients newly diagnosed with prostate cancer: a single institution experience.', 'HIV and cancer in the Veterans Health Administration System.', 'Is There an Optimal Curative Option in HIV-Positive Men with Localized Prostate Cancer?

An exhaustive transuretral resection of the bladder tumor (TURBT) has always been seen a surrogate of quality for the initial step of the treatment. Although a large majority of bladder tumors can be easily identified macroscopically, there are flat lesions (i.e., carcinoma in situ [CIS]), which are more difficult to diagnose. To improve detection of flat lesions, a fluorescence diagnosis under blue light has been proposed during cystoscopy. Photodynamic diagnosis is performed using blue light after preoperative intravesical instillation of hexaminolaevulinic acid (Hexvix(®)) to enhance visual contrast between urothelial cancer and normal tissue. Thus, the quality of TURBT appears to be improved in selected cases with a controversial benefit on the recurrence free survival.

Materials and methods:   Cytotoxic activity of gamma-oryzanol on human DU145 and PC3 prostate cancer cells was determined by proliferation assay using 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol, 2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) reagent. mRNA levels of genes involved in the intracellular antioxidant system, superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPX) and glutathione reductase (GSR) were determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Cancer cell lysates were used to measure lipid peroxidation using thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS). Glutathione contents of the cell lysates were estimated by the reaction between sulfhydryl group of 5, 5'-dithio (bis) nitrobenzoic acid (DTNB) to produce a yellow- color of 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoic acid using colorimetric assay. Catalase activity was also analysed by examining peroxidative function. Protein concentration was estimated by Bradford's assay.  Results:   All concentrations of gamma-oryzanol, 0.1-2.0mg/ml, significantly inhibited cell growth in a dose- and time-dependent fashion in both prostate cancer cell lines, DU145 and PC3. Gene expression of catalase in DU145 and PC3 exposed to gamma-orizanol at 0.5mg/ml for 14 days was down regulated, while mRNA of GPX was also down regulated in PC3. The MDA and glutathione levels including catalase activity in the cell lysates of DU145 and PC3 treated with gamma-oryzanol 0.1 and 0.5mg/ml were generally decreased.  Conclusions:   This study highlighted effects of gamma-oryzanol via the down-regulation of antioxidant genes, catalase and GPX, not cytotoxic roles. This might be interesting for adjuvant chemotherapy to make prostate cancer cells more sensitive to free radicals.

Materials and methods:   The GSE3824 gene expression profile of prostate cancer was downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus database which including 21 normal samples and 18 prostate cancer cells. The DEGs were identified by Limma package in R language and gene ontology and pathway enrichment analyses were performed. In addition, potential regulatory microRNAs and the target sites of the transcription factors were screened out based on the molecular signature database. In addition, the DEGs were mapped to the connectivity map database to identify potential small molecule drugs.  Results:   A total of 6,588 genes were filtered as DEGs between normal and prostate cancer samples. Examples such as ITGB6, ITGB3, ITGAV and ITGA2 may induce prostate cancer through actions on the focal adhesion pathway. Furthermore, the transcription factor, SP1, and its target genes ARHGAP26 and USF1 were identified. The most significant microRNA, MIR-506, was screened and found to regulate genes including ITGB1 and ITGB3. Additionally, small molecules MS-275, 8-azaguanine and pyrvinium were discovered to have the potential to repair the disordered metabolic pathways, abd furthermore to remedy prostate cancer.

Methods:   We collected the data of 397 designated cancer care hospitals, including information on staffing in the department of radiation oncology (e.g. radiation oncologists, medical physicists and radiation therapists), the number of linear accelerators and the implementation of advanced radiotherapy technologies from the Center for Cancer Control and Information Services of the National Cancer Center, Japan.  Results:   Only 53% prefectural designated cancer care hospitals and 16% regional designated cancer care hospitals have implemented intensity-modulated radiotherapy for head and neck cancers, and 62% prefectural designated cancer care hospitals and 23% regional designated cancer care hospitals use intensity-modulated radiotherapy for prostate cancer. Seventy-four percent prefectural designated cancer care hospitals and 40% regional designated cancer care hospitals employ stereotactic body radiotherapy for lung cancer. Our multivariate analysis of prefectural designated cancer care hospitals which satisfy the institute's qualifications for advanced technologies revealed the number of radiation oncologists (P = 0.01) and that of radiation therapists (P = 0.003) were significantly correlated with the implementation of intensity-modulated radiotherapy for prostate cancer, and the number of radiation oncologists (P = 0.02) was correlated with the implementation of stereotactic body radiotherapy. There was a trend to correlate the number of medical physicists with the implementation of stereotactic body radiotherapy (P = 0.07). Only 175 (51%) regional designated cancer care hospitals satisfy the institute's qualification of stereotactic body radiotherapy and 76 (22%) satisfy that of intensity-modulated radiotherapy. Seventeen percent prefectural designated cancer care hospitals and 13% regional designated cancer care hospitals had a quality assurance committee.  Conclusions:   The numbers of radiation oncologists and other operating staff might be essential factors in the implementation of advanced radiotherapy technologies.

In this study, 2nd generation (gen) anti-prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) dTc were developed for improving the efficacy of previously developed 1st gen dTc for prostate cancer immunotherapy. The 1st gen dTc are modified with chimeric immunoglobulin-T cell receptor (IgTCR) while the 2nd gen dTc are engineered with an immunoglobulin-CD28-T cell receptor (IgCD28TCR), which incorporates a CD28 costimulatory signal for optimal T cell activation.  Methods:   A 2nd gen anti-PSMA IgCD28TCR CAR was constructed by inserting the CD28 signal domain into the 1st gen CAR. 1st and 2nd gen anti-PSMA dTc were created by transducing human T cells with anti-PSMA CARs and their antitumor efficacy was compared for specific activation on PSMA-expressing tumor contact, cytotoxicity against PSMA-expressing tumor cells in vitro, and suppression of tumor growth in an animal model.  Results:   The 2nd gen dTc can be optimally activated to secrete larger amounts of cytokines such as IL2 and IFNγ than 1st gen and to proliferate more vigorously on PSMA-expressing tumor contact. More importantly, the 2nd gen dTc preserve the PSMA-specific cytotoxicity in vitro and suppress tumor growth in animal models with significant higher potency.

The role of Src-Tks5 signaling in invasive prostate cancer, however, had not been previously evaluated.  Methods:   We measured the relative expression of Tks5 in normal (n = 20) and cancerous (n = 184, from 92 patients) prostate tissue specimens by immunohistochemistry using a commercially available tumor microarray. We also manipulated the expression and activity of wild-type and mutant Src and Tks5 constructs in the LNCaP and PC-3 prostate cancer cell lines in order to ascertain the role of Src-Tks5 signaling in invadopodia development, matrix-remodeling activity, motility, and invasion.  Results:   Our studies demonstrated that Src was activated and Tks5 upregulated in high Gleason score prostate tumor specimens and in invasive prostate cancer cell lines. Remarkably, overexpression of Tks5 in LNCaP cells was sufficient to induce invadopodia formation and associated matrix degradation. This Tks5-dependent increase in invasive behavior further depended on Src tyrosine kinase activity and the phosphorylation of Tks5 at tyrosine residues 557 and 619. In PC-3 cells we demonstrated that Tks5 phosphorylation at these sites was necessary and sufficient for invadopodia-associated matrix degradation and invasion.

These roles involve association with integrins on both cell-cell and cell-stroma levels. Furthermore, CD151 plays a role in endothelial cell motility. CD151 expression was examined in three commonly used prostate cancer cell lines. We investigated CD151 expression, angiogenesis (microvessel density; MVD) and lymphangiogenesis (lymphatic vessel density; LVD) in an orthotopic xenograft model of prostate cancer in matched tumours from primary and secondary sites. CD151 was found to be heterogeneously expressed across different prostate cancer cell lines and the levels of CD151 expression were significantly higher in the highly tumorigenic, androgen-insensitive cells PC-3 and DU-145 compared to the androgen-sensitive cell line LNCaP (P<0.05). The majority of in vivo xenografts developed pelvic lymph node metastases. Importantly, primary tumours that developed metastasis had significantly higher CD151 expression and MVD compared to those which did not develop metastasis (P<0.05). We identified, for the first time, that CD151 expression is associated with LVD in prostate cancer. These findings underscore the potential role of CD151 and angiogenesis in the metastatic potential of prostate cancer.

Addition of 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine, a specific inhibitor of DNA methylation, into the culture medium reversed the low expression levels of miR-375 in the AR negative PCa cells. In addition, the total activity levels of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) were high in AR-negative PCa cells, in which hypermethylation of miR-375 promoter and low expression levels of miR-375 were observed.

We demonstrate miR-205 to be significantly down-regulated in over 70% of the HRPCa samples analysed and that reconstitution of miR-205 causes inhibition of proliferation and invasiveness in prostate cancer (PCa) cell lines. Additionally, miR-205 is increasingly down-regulated in lymph node metastases compared to the primary tumour indicating that miR-205 plays a role in migration of PCa cells from the original location into extraprostatic tissue. Nevertheless, down-regulation of miR-205 in primary PCa was not correlated to the synchronous presence of metastasis and failed to predict the outcome for HRPCa patients. Moreover, we found a tendency for miR-205 up-regulation to correlate with an adverse outcome of PCa patients suggesting a pivotal role of miR-205 in tumourigenesis.

We report our initial experience of treating 100 patients by robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) with a focus on constitutional introduction and implementation based on minimal invasive surgery center (MISC) and patient outcomes.  Methods:   The MISC involved all of the hospital sections related to robotic surgery including four surgery departments, anesthesiology, operating room nurses, medical engineers. The data were prospectively collected from the first 100 consecutive patients who underwent RARP under supervision of MISC for localized PCa from October 2010 to December 2012.  Results:   During the period of our initial 100 cases of RARP, the gynecology, respiratory and digestive surgery departments performed initial cases of 20, 33 and 23 robotic surgeries under control of MISC. Peri-operative complications in RARP appeared to be minimal with no cases of intra-operative open conversion. The positive surgical margin rate was 19% for the entire series. At the median follow-up time of 11.9 months, 91% of patients had undetectable PSA levels, and 76% of patients were not using pads. Sequential urinary functional data indicated a significant beneficial effect on lower urinary tract symptoms beyond cancer control over a period of several months. Although the pre-operative potent patient number was small, the transitions of constant potency recovery at precise time points were shown according to different nerve sparing procedures.  Conclusions:   This is the first report of an initial 100 RARP cases that were implemented using the constitutional framework of an academic institution. The MISC is providing immeasurable benefits from the aspects of patient safety and education for the robotic surgical team. RARP is a safe and efficient method for achieving PCa control together with functional preservation, even during the initial trial for this procedure.""","""['Takehiro Sejima', 'Toshihiko Masago', 'Shuichi Morizane', 'Katsuya Hikita', 'Naoto Kobayashi', 'Akihisa Yao', 'Kuniyasu Muraoka', 'Masashi Honda', 'Hiroya Kitano', 'Atsushi Takenaka']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""BMC Res Notes""","""['Bilateral nerve sparing robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy is associated with faster continence recovery but not with erectile function recovery compared with retropubic open prostatectomy: the need for accurate selection of patients.', 'Pathological confirmation of nerve-sparing types performed during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP).', 'Retzius-sparing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy using the Revo-i robotic surgical system: surgical technique and results of the first human trial.', 'Methods for training of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Best practices in robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: recommendations of the Pasadena Consensus Panel.', 'The role of laparoscopic experience on the learning curve of HoLEP surgery: A questionnaire-based study.', 'The First Pilot Comprehensive Evaluation of the Outcomes of Different Types of Robotic Surgeries in the Different Surgical Departments: The Penta, Tetra and Trifecta Achievements in Robotic Surgeries.', 'Robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy learning curve for experienced laparoscopic surgeons: does it really exist?']"""

However, there have been relatively few attempts to apply these datasets to human complex disease or traits.  Methods:   We integrated multiple oestrogen receptor alpha (ESR1) ChIP datasets in the Genomic Hyperbrowser. We analysed these datasets for overlap with DNase I hypersensitivity peaks, differentially expressed genes with estradiol treatment and regions near single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with sex-related diseases and traits. We used FIMO to scan ESR1 binding sites for classical ESR1 binding motifs drawn from the JASPAR database.  Results:   We found that binding sites present in multiple datasets were enriched for classical ESR1 binding motifs, DNase I hypersensitivity peaks and differentially expressed genes after estradiol treatment compared with those present in only few datasets. There was significant enrichment of ESR1 binding present in multiple datasets near genomic regions associated with breast cancer (7.45-fold, p = 0.001), height (2.45-fold, p = 0.002), multiple sclerosis (5.97-fold, p < 0.0002) and prostate cancer (4.47-fold, p = 0.0008), and suggestive evidence of ESR1 enrichment for regions associated with coronary artery disease, ovarian cancer, Parkinson's disease, polycystic ovarian syndrome and testicular cancer. Integration of multiple cell line ESR1 ChIP datasets also increases overlap with ESR1 ChIP-seq peaks from primary cancer samples, further supporting this approach as helpful in identifying true positive ESR1 binding sites in cell line systems.  Conclusions:   Our study suggests that integration of multiple ChIP datasets can highlight binding sites likely to be of particular biological importance and can provide important insights into understanding human health and disease. However, it also highlights the high number of likely false positive binding sites in ChIP datasets drawn from cell lines and illustrates the importance of considering multiple independent experiments together.""","""['Adam E Handel', 'Geir K Sandve', 'Giulio Disanto', 'Lahiru Handunnetthi', 'Gavin Giovannoni', 'Sreeram V Ramagopalan']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""BMC Med Genomics""","""['ESR1 ChIP-Seq Identifies Distinct Ligand-Free ESR1 Genomic Binding Sites in Human Hepatocytes and Liver Tissue.', 'Differential DNase I hypersensitivity reveals factor-dependent chromatin dynamics.', 'Discovery of estrogen receptor alpha target genes and response elements in breast tumor cells.', 'Mutation site and context dependent effects of ESR1 mutation in genome-edited breast cancer cell models.', 'Role of ChIP-seq in the discovery of transcription factor binding sites, differential gene regulation mechanism, epigenetic marks and beyond.', ""The Potential Circular RNAs Biomarker Panel and Regulatory Networks of Parkinson's Disease."", 'Several Critical Cell Types, Tissues, and Pathways Are Implicated in Genome-Wide Association Studies for Systemic Lupus Erythematosus.', 'Bioinformatics Analysis of Estrogen-Responsive Genes.', '17β-Estradiol Ameliorates Tight Junction Disruption via Repression of MMP Transcription.', 'Peptidylprolyl Isomerase Pin1 Directly Enhances the DNA Binding Functions of Estrogen Receptor α.']"""

The aim of this study was to investigate the relative utility of a newly developed N-terminal propeptide of collagen type I (PINP) human serum assay for the detection of BM in cancer patients. This assay has a corresponding rat PINP assay which in the future might help in translational science between rodent and human trials.  Methods:   Participants were 161 prostate, lung and breast cancer patients stratified by number of BM (Soloway score). PINP was assessed and correlated to number of BM. Additionally, the PINP marker was correlated to bone resorption of young (ALPHA CTX-I)- and aged bone (BETA CTX-I); number of osteoclasts (Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 5b, TRACP5B) and osteoclast activity (CTX-I/ TRACP5B).  Results:   PINP was significantly elevated in breast- and prostate cancer patients +BM, compared to -BM (P < 0.001), however not in lung cancer patients. A strong linear association was seen between PINP and the number of BMs. Significant elevation of PINP was observed at Soloway scores 1-4 (<0 BM) compared with score 0 (0 BM) (P < 0.001). The correlation between bone resorption of young bone or aged bone and bone formation was highly significant in patients +BM and -BM (P < 0.0001).  Conclusions:   Data suggest that the present PINP potentially could determine skeletal involvement in patients with breast or prostate cancer.

As part of the PROCURE Prostate Cancer Biobank launched in 2007, four University Hospitals in Quebec joined to bank fresh frozen prostate tissues from radical prostatectomies (RP). As the biobank progressed towards allocation, the nature and quality of the tissues were determined. RP tissues were collected by standardized alternate mirror-image or biopsy-based targeted methods, and frozen for banking. Clinical/pathological parameters were captured. For quality control, two presumed benign and two presumed cancerous frozen, biobanked tissue blocks per case (10/site) were randomly selected during the five years of collection. In a consensus meeting, 4 pathologists blindly evaluated slides (n=160) and graded quality, Gleason score (GS), and size of cancer foci. The quality of tissue RNA (37/40 cases) was assessed using the RNA Integrity Number. The biobank included 1819 patients of mean age: 62.1 years; serum PSA: 8 ng/ml; prostate weight: 47.8 g; GS: 7; and pathological stage: T2 in 64.5%, T3A in 25.5% and T3B in 10% of cases. Of the 157 evaluable slides, 79 and 78 had benign and cancer tissue, respectively. GS for the 37 cancer-positive cases were: 6 in 9, 7 in 18 and >7 in 10 and, in most instances, in concordance with final GS. In 40% of slides containing cancer, foci occupied ≥50% of block surface and 42% had a diameter ≥1 cm. Tissue was well preserved and consistently yielded RNA of very good quality with RNA Integrity Number (RIN) >7 for 97% of cases (mean=8.7 ± 0.7) during the five-year collection period. This study confirms the high quality of randomly selected benign and cancerous fresh-frozen prostate tissues of the PROCURE Quebec Prostate Cancer Biobank.

Delivery of a suicide gene sequence into tumors by lentiviral transduction embodies a cancer gene therapy that could employ bystander cell killing as a mechanism driving significant tumor regression in vivo. Here we present evidence of a significant bystander cell killing in vitro and in vivo mediated by the TMPK/AZT suicide gene axis that is reliant on the formation of functional gap-junctional intercellular communications (GJICs). Potentiation of AZT activation by the engineered TMPK expressed in the human prostate cancer cell line, PC-3, resulted in effective bystander killing of PC-3 cells lacking TMPK expression--an effect that could be blocked by the GJIC inhibitor, carbenoxolone. Although GJICs are mainly formed by connexins, a new family of GJIC molecules designated pannexins has been recently identified. PC-3 cells expressed both connexin43 (Cx43) and Pannexin1 (Panx1), but Panx1 expression predominated at the plasma membrane, whereas Cx43 expression was primarily localized to the cytosol. The contribution of bystander effects to the reduction of solid tumor xenografts established by the PC-3 cell line was evaluated in an animal model. We demonstrate the contribution of bystander cell killing to tumor regression in a xenograft model relying on the delivery of expression of the TMPK suicide gene into tumors via direct intratumoral injection of recombinant therapeutic lentivirus. Taken together, our data underscore that the TMPK/AZT enzyme-prodrug axis can be effectively utilized in suicide gene therapy of solid tumors, wherein significant tumor regression can be achieved via bystander effects mediated by GJICs.""","""['Takeya Sato', 'Anton Neschadim', 'Arnon Lavie', 'Teruyuki Yanagisawa', 'Jeffrey A Medin']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Evaluation of Bystander Cell Killing Effects in Suicide Gene Therapy of Cancer: Engineered Thymidylate Kinase (TMPK)/AZT Enzyme-Prodrug Axis.', 'Engineered human tmpk/AZT as a novel enzyme/prodrug axis for suicide gene therapy.', 'The engineered thymidylate kinase (TMPK)/azidothymidine (AZT)-axis offers efficient bystander cell killing effect for suicide gene therapy for cancer.', 'Introduction to the background, principles, and state of the art in suicide gene therapy.', 'Bystander effect in herpes simplex virus-thymidine kinase/ganciclovir cancer gene therapy: role of gap-junctional intercellular communication.', 'A Winning New Combination?

However, only approximately 50% of patients benefit from treatment and all develop docetaxel-resistant disease. Here, we characterize global perturbations in tyrosine kinase signaling associated with docetaxel resistance and thereby develop a potential therapeutic strategy to reverse this phenotype. Using quantitative mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomics, we identified that metastatic docetaxel-resistant prostate cancer cell lines (DU145-Rx and PC3-Rx) exhibit increased phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) on Y397 and Y576, in comparison with parental controls (DU145 and PC3, respectively). Bioinformatic analyses identified perturbations in pathways regulating focal adhesions and the actin cytoskeleton and in protein-protein interaction networks related to these pathways in docetaxel-resistant cells. Treatment with the FAK tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) PF-00562271 reduced FAK phosphorylation in the resistant cells, but did not affect cell viability or Akt phosphorylation. Docetaxel administration reduced FAK and Akt phosphorylation, whereas cotreatment with PF-00562271 and docetaxel resulted in an additive attenuation of FAK and Akt phosphorylation and overcame the chemoresistant phenotype. The enhanced efficacy of cotreatment was due to increased autophagic cell death, rather than apoptosis. These data strongly support that enhanced FAK activation mediates chemoresistance in CRPC, and identify a potential clinical niche for FAK TKIs, where coadministration with docetaxel may be used in patients with CRPC to overcome chemoresistance.""","""['Brian Y Lee', 'Falko Hochgräfe', 'Hui-Ming Lin', 'Lesley Castillo', 'Jianmin Wu', 'Mark J Raftery', 'S Martin Shreeve', 'Lisa G Horvath', 'Roger J Daly']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Ther""","""['Effect of FAK inhibitor VS-6063 (defactinib) on docetaxel efficacy in prostate cancer.', 'EGFR mediates docetaxel resistance in human castration-resistant prostate cancer through the Akt-dependent expression of ABCB1 (MDR1).', 'Synergistic antitumor effect of NVP-BEZ235 and sunitinib on docetaxel-resistant human castration-resistant prostate cancer cells.', 'Emerging targets to monitor and overcome docetaxel resistance in castration resistant prostate cancer (review).', 'PIM1 kinase as a target in prostate cancer: roles in tumorigenesis, castration resistance, and docetaxel resistance.', 'Advancements in Oncoproteomics Technologies: Treading toward Translation into Clinical Practice.', 'Identification and Validation of Three Hub Genes Involved in Cell Proliferation and Prognosis of Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Proteomic Analysis of Prostate Cancer FFPE Samples Reveals Markers of Disease Progression and Aggressiveness.', 'Signaling Pathways in Cancer: Therapeutic Targets, Combinatorial Treatments, and New Developments.', 'Post-Translational Modifications That Drive Prostate Cancer Progression.']"""

We observed that the JF1/Ms mice develop various spontaneous tumors at a high incidence late in life. The aim of this study was to elucidate the mechanism responsible for spontaneous tumors in these mice. Possible relevance of milk-borne mammary tumor virus and gene alterations in Ednrb to tumorigenesis was explored.  Methods:   Expression and methylation status of Ednrb were quantitatively analyzed in normal and cancer tissues of mammary gland, liver, submandibular gland as well as in a cultured cell line, MW1, established from a submandibular gland adenocarcinoma. The biological effects of EDNRB were examined in the MW1 cells transfected with wild-type Ednrb.  Results:   Transcripts of Ednrb were barely detectable, and the promoter region of Ednrb was hypermethylated in tumor tissues and the MW1 cells. In contrast, normal counterpart tissues showed positive expression of Ednrb transcripts and had unmethylated promoter regions. Treatment of the MW1 cells with 5-Aza-dC restored transcription of Ednrb to normal levels. Transfection of the MW1 cells with Ednrb1 (MW1-Ednrb1) resulted in lower growth rates and morphological changes compared with the mock-transfected MW1 cells (MW1-mock1). Furthermore, the MW1-Ednrb1 cells transplanted in syngeneic mice showed a lower proliferation rate than the MW1-mock1 cells.  Conclusions:   Germline mutation and subsequent promoter methylation of Ednrb may be relevant to cancer susceptibility in the JF1/Ms mice.

Expression of each of the five muscarinic receptor subtype transcripts was assessed by real-time PCR and association with patient age, prostate size, prostate-specific antigen level, pathological diagnosis, and concomitant medication were explored. M1 and M4 receptors were the most and least prevalently expressed subtypes in the human prostate, respectively. M1 receptor mRNA expression was weakly but significantly associated with prostate size (r = 0.2494, p = 0.0451), but mRNA expression of none of the five subtypes was significantly associated with age, prostate-specific antigen level, pathological diagnosis (benign prostatic hyperplasia vs. prostate cancer), or concomitant medication (5α-reductase inhibitors, α1- or β-adrenoceptor antagonists). We conclude that human prostate muscarinic receptor subtype transcripts apparently undergo only a very limited regulation by a variety of physiological, pathophysiological, or treatment factors.

Repeated rounds of metastatic selection (LN1-LN4) progressively increased the epithelial phenotype, resulting in a new model of tumor cell mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET). DU145-LN4 showed increased cell-cell adhesions, higher expression of multiple epithelial markers, such as E-cadherin, EpCAM and cytokeratin 18, and reduced expression of mesenchymal markers such as vimentin. The MET in DU145-LN4 cells was accompanied by increased expression of the miR-200 family, and antimiRs to miR-200c and miR-141 induced an EMT. MET also correlated with the loss of miR-424. Ectopic transient and stable miR-424 expression induced EMT, with reduced epithelial marker expression and increased cell scattering. Our model provides evidence for spontaneous MET in vivo.

Methods:   The study included 21 patients who underwent TRUS biopsy and multi-technique imaging before radical prostatectomy. Values from five different tests (TRUS biopsy, DW MRI, CHOL PET, FDG PET, and combined DW MRI/CHOL PET) were correlated with the prostatectomy GR using Spearman's ρ. Tests that were found to have significant correlations were used to classify patients into GR groups.  Results:   The following tests had significant correlations with prostatectomy GR: TRUS biopsy (ρ = 0.617, P = 0.003), DW MRI (ρ = -0.601, P = 0.004), and combined DW MRI/CHOL PET (ρ = -0.623, P = 0.003).

The significant coefficients of determination (r2) were higher at the regional level (r2 = 0.32-0.71), weaker at the governorate level (r2 = 0.03-0.43), and declined slightly at the city level (r2 = 0.17-0.33), suggesting that an increased aggregated spatial level increased the explained variability and the model GOF. However, the low GOF at the lowest spatial level suggests that additional variation remains unexplained. At different spatial levels, associations between NO2 concentration and the most common cancers were marginally improved in geographically weighted regression (GWR) analysis, which explained both global and local heterogeneity and variations in cancer incidence. High coefficients of determination were observed between NO2 concentration and lung and breast cancer incidences, followed by prostate, bladder, cervical and ovarian cancers, confirming results from other studies.

The net effect of endoglin expression on cancer outcomes from animal studies has proven controversial. We evaluated whether reduced systemic endoglin levels, expected in patients diagnosed with HHT, impacted clinical outcomes for cancer.  Methods:   A retrospective cohort analysis using Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare was conducted to evaluate the effect of HHT on survival among patients diagnosed with breast, colorectal, lung, or prostate cancer between 2000 and 2007 (n = 540,520). We generated Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Cox models to compare the effect of HHT on all-cause survival for a composite of the four cancers, and separate models by cancer, adjusting for demographic variables, cancer type, cancer stage, and comorbidities.  Results:   All-cause survival analysis for a composite of the four cancers showed an adjusted HR of 0.69 [95% confidence interval (CI) of 0.51-0.91; P = 0.009] for HHT, indicating significantly improved survival outcome. When stratified by cancer type, HHT diagnosis showed a significant protective effect among breast cancer patients with an adjusted HR of 0.31 (95% CI, 0.13-0.75; P = 0.009).  Conclusions:   There was a significant association between HHT and improved survival outcome for a composite of patients with breast, prostate, colorectal, and lung cancer, and in analysis stratified by cancer, the association was significant for HHT patients with breast cancer.

Accordingly, here we synthesized gram-scale quantities of B2G2, compared it with B2G2 isolated from GSE for possible equivalent biological activity and conducted mechanistic studies. Both B2G2 preparations inhibited cell growth, decreased clonogenicity, and induced cell cycle arrest and apoptotic death, comparable to each other, in various human PCa cell lines. Mechanistic studies focusing on transcription factors involved in apoptotic and survival pathways revealed that B2G2 significantly inhibits NF-κB and activator protein1 (AP1) transcriptional activity and nuclear translocation of signal transducer and activator of transcription3 (Stat3) in PCa cell lines, irrespective of their functional androgen receptor status. B2G2 also decreased survivin expression which is regulated by NF-κB, AP1, and Stat3 and increased cleaved PARP level.

There was a positive association between serum PSA and 1,25(OH)2D in men with prostate disease (mean = 110.6 pmol/L; p heterogeneity = 0.03), but there was no such association in men free of prostate disease (mean = 109.3 pmol/L; p heterogeneity = 0.8).

Personal history of severe acne, a surrogate for higher androgen activity, has been associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer (PCa), and one recent study indicated that severe teenage acne was a novel risk factor for melanoma. These findings suggest a possible relationship between PCa and risk of melanoma. We prospectively evaluated this association among US men.  Methods:   A total of 42,372 participants in the Health Professionals' Follow-Up Study (HPFS; 1986 to 2010) were included. Biennially self-reported PCa diagnosis was confirmed using pathology reports. Diagnosis of melanoma and nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC) was self-reported biennially, and diagnosis of melanoma was pathologically confirmed. We sought to confirm the association in 18,603 participants from the Physicians' Health Study (PHS; 1982 to 1998).  Results:   We identified 539 melanomas in the HPFS. Personal history of PCa was associated with an increased risk of melanoma (multivariate-adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.83; 95% CI, 1.32 to 2.54). Although we also detected a marginally increased risk of NMSC associated with PCa (HR, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.995 to 1.16), the difference in the magnitude of the association between melanoma and NMSC was significant (P for heterogeneity = .002). We did not find an altered risk of melanoma associated with personal history of other cancers. The association between PCa and risk of incident melanoma was confirmed in the PHS (HR, 2.17; 95% CI, 1.12 to 4.21).  Conclusion:   Personal history of PCa is associated with an increased risk of melanoma, which may not be entirely a result of greater medical scrutiny.""","""['Wen-Qing Li', 'Abrar A Qureshi', 'Jing Ma', 'Alisa M Goldstein', 'Edward L Giovannucci', 'Meir J Stampfer', 'Jiali Han']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Clin Oncol""","""['Teenage acne and cancer risk in US women: A prospective cohort study.', ""Calcium plus vitamin D supplementation and the risk of nonmelanoma and melanoma skin cancer: post hoc analyses of the women's health initiative randomized controlled trial."", 'Sildenafil use and increased risk of incident melanoma in US men: a prospective cohort study.', 'Associations of non-melanoma skin cancer and melanoma, extra-cutaneous cancers and smoking in adults: a US population-based study.', 'History of Keratinocyte Carcinoma and Risk of Melanoma: A Prospective Cohort Study.', 'Nanoparticle-Based Combination Therapy for Melanoma.', 'A Novel Overall Survival Prediction Signature Based on Comprehensive Research in Prostate Cancer Bone Metastases.', 'Immunogenetic clustering of 30 cancers.', 'Ambient UVR and Environmental Arsenic Exposure in Relation to Cutaneous Melanoma in Iowa.', 'Gender-specific associations between polymorphisms of the circadian gene RORA and cutaneous melanoma susceptibility.']"""

Patients and methods:   A cohort of 11,772 men newly diagnosed with nonmetastatic prostate cancer between April 1, 1998, and December 31, 2009, followed until October 1, 2012, was identified using a large population-based electronic database from the United Kingdom. Time-dependent Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CIs of mortality outcomes associated with postdiagnostic use of statins, lagged by 1 year to account for latency considerations and to minimize reverse causality, and considering effect modification by prediagnostic use of statins.  Results:   During a mean follow-up time of 4.4 years (standard deviation, 2.9 years), 3,499 deaths occurred, including 1,791 from prostate cancer. Postdiagnostic use of statins was associated with a decreased risk of prostate cancer mortality (HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.66 to 0.88) and all-cause mortality (HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.78 to 0.95). These decreased risks of prostate cancer mortality and all-cause mortality were more pronounced in patients who also used statins before diagnosis (HR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.41 to 0.74; and HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.53 to 0.81, respectively), with weaker effects in patients who initiated the treatment only after diagnosis (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.71 to 0.96; and HR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.82 to 1.01, respectively).

Current nomograms, which yield continuous risk probabilities, do not separate high-risk PCa into distinct sub-strata. Here, we derive a binary definition of very-high-risk (VHR) localized PCa to aid in risk stratification at diagnosis and selection of therapy.  Methods:   We queried the Johns Hopkins radical prostatectomy database to identify 753 men with NCCN high-risk localized PCa (Gleason sum 8-10, PSA >20 ng ml(-1), or clinical stage ≥T3). Twenty-eight alternate permutations of adverse grade, stage and cancer volume were compared by their hazard ratios for metastasis and cancer-specific mortality. VHR criteria with top-ranking hazard ratios were further evaluated by multivariable analyses and inclusion of a clinically meaningful proportion of the high-risk cohort.  Results:   The VHR cohort was best defined by primary pattern 5 present on biopsy, or ≥5 cores with Gleason sum 8-10, or multiple NCCN high-risk features. These criteria encompassed 15.1% of the NCCN high-risk cohort. Compared with other high-risk men, VHR men were at significantly higher risk for metastasis (hazard ratio 2.75) and cancer-specific mortality (hazard ratio 3.44) (P<0.001 for both). Among high-risk men, VHR men also had significantly worse 10-year metastasis-free survival (37% vs 78%) and cancer-specific survival (62% vs 90%).  Conclusions:   Men who meet VHR criteria form a subgroup within the current NCCN high-risk classification who have particularly poor oncological outcomes. Use of these characteristics to distinguish VHR localized PCa may help in counseling and selection optimal candidates for multimodal treatments or clinical trials.""","""['D Sundi', 'V M Wang', 'P M Pierorazio', 'M Han', 'T J Bivalacqua', 'M W Ball', 'E S Antonarakis', 'A W Partin', 'E M Schaeffer', 'A E Ross']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['Prostate cancer: The high-risk dichotomy.', 'Very High-Risk Localized Prostate Cancer: Outcomes Following Definitive Radiation.', 'Outcomes of very high-risk prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy: Validation study from 3 centers.', 'Preoperative characteristics of high-Gleason disease predictive of favourable pathological and clinical outcomes at radical prostatectomy.', 'Prognostic utility of biopsy-derived cell cycle progression score in patients with National Comprehensive Cancer Network low-risk prostate cancer undergoing radical prostatectomy: implications for treatment guidance.', 'Systematic review: comparative effectiveness and harms of treatments for clinically localized prostate cancer.', 'Biochemical recurrence after chemohormonal therapy followed by robot-assisted radical prostatectomy in very-high-risk prostate cancer patients.', 'Long-Term Outcomes of a Phase I Trial of Weekly Docetaxel, Total Androgen Blockade, and Image Guided Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy for Localized High-Risk Prostate Adenocarcinoma.', 'Role of Brachytherapy Boost in Clinically Localized Intermediate and High-Risk Prostate Cancer: Lack of Benefit in Patients with Very High-Risk Factors T3b-4 and/or Gleason 9-10.', 'Neoadjuvant Chemohormonal Therapy in Prostate Cancer Before Radical Prostatectomy: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'Diagnostic and Therapeutic Challenges in a Patient with Synchronous Very High-Risk Prostate Adenocarcinoma and Anal Carcinoma.']"""

The expression of C-FABP, PPARβ/δ and PPARγ was measured by western blot analysis in prostate cell lines and by immunohistochemical staining in tissue sections of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and prostatic carcinomas. The correlation between the expression of PPARs and C-FABP was assessed. The significance of increased expression of these proteins was analysed with respect to prognosis and compared with those of alternative biomarkers. The expression levels of C-FABP and PPARγ in prostate cancer cell lines and the cytoplasm and nuclei of carcinoma tissues were significantly (Student's t-test, p<0.05) higher compared to those in benign cell lines and BPH tissues. The raised expression level of C-FABP and PPARγ was significantly correlated with the increased combined Gleason scores (GS) of the carcinomas. Enhanced expression of cytoplasmic C-FABP significantly correlated with increased nuclear PPARγ (Student's t-test, p<0.005). While expression of PPARβ/δ in carcinomas did not correlate with patient outcome, the increased levels of both C-FABP and PPARγ were associated with shorter patient survival. Multivariate analysis indicated that C-FABP was independently associated with patient survival, whereas PPARγ was confounded by C-FABP in predicting patient survival. Thus, the increased C-FABP may interact with PPARγ in a coordinated mechanism to facilitate malignant progression in prostatic cancer. Both C-FABP and PPARγ are suitable as prognostic factors to predict the clinical outcome of prostatic cancer patients.""","""['Farzad S Forootan', 'Shiva S Forootan', 'Mohammed I Malki', 'Danqing Chen', 'Gandi Li', 'Ke Lin', 'Philip S Rudland', 'Christopher S Foster', 'Youqiang Ke']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Int J Oncol""","""['Fatty acid binding proteins (FABPs) in prostate, bladder and kidney cancer cell lines and the use of IL-FABP as survival predictor in patients with renal cell carcinoma.', 'The increased expression of fatty acid-binding protein 9 in prostate cancer and its prognostic significance.', 'Expression of cutaneous fatty acid-binding protein (C-FABP) in prostate cancer: potential prognostic marker and target for tumourigenicity-suppression.', 'Autophagy in nuclear receptor PPARgamma-deficient mouse prostatic carcinogenesis.', 'The role of PPARγ in prostate cancer development and progression.', 'Simvastatin Improves Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia: Role of Peroxisome-Proliferator-Activated Receptor-γ and Classic WNT/β-Catenin Pathway.', 'Histone methyltransferase KMT2D mediated lipid metabolism via peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma in prostate cancer.', 'Fatty acid-binding protein 5 (FABP5)-related signal transduction pathway in castration-resistant prostate cancer cells: a potential therapeutic target.', 'Transcriptome-based biomarker gene screening and evaluation of the extracellular fatty acid-binding protein (Ex-FABP) on immune and angiogenesis-related genes in chicken erythrocytes of tibial dyschondroplasia.', 'The Biological Functions and Regulatory Mechanisms of Fatty Acid Binding Protein 5 in Various Diseases.']"""

This study assessed clinicians' perceptions of care difficulty, quality of life (QOL), and symptom reports for their lung cancer patients compared with their patients with breast, prostate, and colon cancer.  Methods:   This report focused on secondary analyses from the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Symptom Outcomes and Practice Patterns (SOAPP) study (E2Z02); outcome measures included clinician ratings of 3106 solid tumor patients. Univariate analyses focused on patterns of disease-specific perceptions; multivariable analyses examined whether disease-specific differences persisted after covariate inclusion.  Results:   In univariate comparisons, clinicians rated lung cancer patients as more difficult to treat than other solid tumor patients, with poorer QOL and higher symptom reports. After covariates were adjusted, the odds of clinicians perceiving lower QOL for their lung cancer patients were 3.6 times larger than for patients with other solid tumors (odds ratio = 3.6 [95% confidence interval, 2.0-6.6]; p < 0.0001). In addition, the odds of clinicians perceiving weight difficulties for their lung cancer patients were 3.2 times larger (odds ratio = 3.2 [95% confidence interval, 1.7-6.0]; p = 0.0004). No other outcome showed significant differences between lung versus other cancers in multivariable models.  Conclusion:   Clinicians were more pessimistic about the well-being of their lung cancer patients compared with patients with other solid tumors. Differences remained for clinician perceptions of patient QOL and weight difficulty, even after controlling for such variables as stage, performance status, and patient-reported outcomes. These continuing disparities suggest possible perception bias.

However, this model has been developed in patients exclusively treated with open radical prostatectomy. No study has specifically assessed the accuracy of this model among men treated with robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP). We hypothesized that EAU indications for PLND are accurate also among patients treated with RARP.  Materials and methods:   We evaluated 615 patients treated with RARP and PLND between 2006 and 2012 at a single tertiary referral center. The predictive accuracy of the nomogram was quantified using the receiver operating characteristic-derived area under the curve, the calibration plot method, and decision curve analyses.  Results:   Median of lymph nodes (LNs) removed was 9 (interquartile range: 6-13). The rate of LNI was 5%. External validation of the Briganti nomogram showed good accuracy (81.8%). A nomogram-derived cutoff of 5% would allow the avoidance of 75% of PLND at the cost of missing of 19.4% of patients with LNI. When the same analyses were repeated in men with at least 10 and 15 LNs removed, the 5% cutoff was associated with a reduction in PLND and with an LNI missing rates of 67.6% and 59.3% and 17.4% and 6.2%, respectively. Similarly, the prediction accuracy increased to 81.2% and 85.3%, respectively. The decision curve analysis showed an increase in the net-benefit in the prediction range between 2.5% and 54%.  Conclusions:   We report the first validation of the EAU guideline recommendation for PLND among patients exclusively treated with RARP.

Sexual function; erection recovery within 6 mo was only observed with RARP; however, overall recovery rate of erection was 65% and 75% with RARP and RRP, respectively (p = 0.69).  Complications:   1 case with a rectal injury was seen in both groups, but complication rates were 8.7% and 16.2% with RARP and RRP, respectively (p = 0.22).  Conclusion:   In spite of our initial experience of RARP, surgical stress and complications with RARP were considered to be superior to that with RRP. Cancer control and sexual function showed no significant difference between RARP and RRP, however, urinary continence outcome is significantly superior with RARP. Our data suggest that treatment outcome after initial experience with RARP is not inferior to that with RRP, and better results are expected by improving surgical techniques.""","""['Hideo Otsuki', 'Yoshitaka Kuwahara', 'Kenzo Nakamura', 'Takuji Tsukamoto']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Nihon Hinyokika Gakkai Zasshi""","""['Systematic review and meta-analysis of studies reporting urinary continence recovery after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Bilateral nerve sparing robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy is associated with faster continence recovery but not with erectile function recovery compared with retropubic open prostatectomy: the need for accurate selection of patients.', 'Robotic vs open prostatectomy in a laparoscopically naive centre: a matched-pair analysis.', 'Comparison of functional outcomes after retropubic and robot-assisted radical nerve-sparing prostatectomy conducted by surgeons with total caseloads of over 1000 prostatectomies.', 'Comparison of perioperative, functional, and oncologic outcomes between standard laparoscopic and robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy: a systemic review and meta-analysis.']"""

Although we now know that the androgen receptor (AR) is important for progression to the deadly advanced stages of the disease, it is poorly understood what AR-regulated processes drive this pathology. Here we demonstrate that AR regulates prostate cancer cell growth via the metabolic sensor 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a kinase that classically regulates cellular energy homeostasis. In patients, activation of AMPK correlated with prostate cancer progression. Using a combination of radiolabeled assays and emerging metabolomic approaches, we also show that prostate cancer cells respond to androgen treatment by increasing not only rates of glycolysis, as is commonly seen in many cancers, but also glucose and fatty acid oxidation. Importantly, this effect was dependent on androgen-mediated AMPK activity. Our results further indicate that the AMPK-mediated metabolic changes increased intracellular ATP levels and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α)-mediated mitochondrial biogenesis, affording distinct growth advantages to the prostate cancer cells. Correspondingly, we used outlier analysis to determine that PGC-1α is overexpressed in a subpopulation of clinical cancer samples. This was in contrast to what was observed in immortalized benign human prostate cells and a testosterone-induced rat model of benign prostatic hyperplasia. Taken together, our findings converge to demonstrate that androgens can co-opt the AMPK-PGC-1α signaling cascade, a known homeostatic mechanism, to increase prostate cancer cell growth. The current study points to the potential utility of developing metabolic-targeted therapies directed toward the AMPK-PGC-1α signaling axis for the treatment of prostate cancer.""","""['J B Tennakoon', 'Y Shi', 'J J Han', 'E Tsouko', 'M A White', 'A R Burns', 'A Zhang', 'X Xia', 'O R Ilkayeva', 'L Xin', 'M M Ittmann', 'F G Rick', 'A V Schally', 'D E Frigo']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1alpha interacts with the androgen receptor (AR) and promotes prostate cancer cell growth by activating the AR.', 'The diabetes medication canagliflozin promotes mitochondrial remodelling of adipocyte via the AMPK-Sirt1-Pgc-1α signalling pathway.', 'GLUT12 promotes prostate cancer cell growth and is regulated by androgens and CaMKK2 signaling.', 'PGC-1alpha, SIRT1 and AMPK, an energy sensing network that controls energy expenditure.', 'Peroxisome Proliferator-activated Receptor Gamma Coactivator-1 Alpha: A Double-edged Sword in Prostate Cancer.', 'New insights into lipid metabolism and prostate cancer (Review).', 'Unraveling the Peculiar Features of Mitochondrial Metabolism and Dynamics in Prostate Cancer.', 'Preclinical models of prostate cancer - modelling androgen dependency and castration resistance in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo.', 'Mechanisms of Prostate Cancer Cells Survival and Their Therapeutic Targeting.', 'Emerging Hallmarks of Metabolic Reprogramming in Prostate Cancer.']"""

It is not clear how this effect is mediated, nor whether this approach can be applied effectively in the clinic. We previously showed that IGF-1R depletion delays repair of radiation-induced DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), unlikely to be explained entirely by reduction in homologous recombination (HR) repair. The current study tested the hypothesis that IGF-1R inhibition induces a repair defect that involves non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). IGF-1R inhibitor AZ12253801 blocked cell survival and radiosensitized IGF-1R-overexpressing murine fibroblasts but not isogenic IGF-1R-null cells, supporting specificity for IGF-1R. IGF-1R inhibition enhanced radiosensitivity in DU145, PC3 and 22Rv1 prostate cancer cells, comparable to effects of Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated inhibition. AZ12253801-treated DU145 cells showed delayed resolution of γH2AX foci, apparent within 1 h of irradiation and persisting for 24 h. In contrast, IGF-1R inhibition did not influence radiosensitivity or γH2AX focus resolution in LNCaP-LN3 cells, suggesting that radiosensitization tracks with the ability of IGF-1R to influence DSB repair. To differentiate effects on repair from growth and cell-survival responses, we tested AZ12253801 in DU145 cells at sub-SF50 concentrations that had no early (⩽48 h) effects on cell cycle distribution or apoptosis induction. Irradiated cultures contained abnormal mitoses, and after 5 days IGF-1R-inhibited cells showed enhanced radiation-induced polyploidy and nuclear fragmentation, consistent with the consequences of entry into mitosis with incompletely repaired DNA. AZ12253801 radiosensitized DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK)-proficient but not DNA-PK-deficient glioblastoma cells, and did not radiosensitize DNA-PK-inhibited DU145 cells, suggesting that in the context of DSB repair, IGF-1R functions in the same pathway as DNA-PK. Finally, IGF-1R inhibition attenuated repair by both NHEJ and HR in HEK293 reporter assays. These data indicate that IGF-1R influences DSB repair by both major DSB repair pathways, findings that may inform clinical application of this approach.""","""['M M Chitnis', 'K A Lodhia', 'T Aleksic', 'S Gao', 'A S Protheroe', 'V M Macaulay']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['Suppression of homologous recombination sensitizes human tumor cells to IGF-1R inhibition.', 'Depletion of the type 1 IGF receptor delays repair of radiation-induced DNA double strand breaks.', 'The complexity of DNA double strand breaks is a critical factor enhancing end-resection.', 'Roles for 53BP1 in the repair of radiation-induced DNA double strand breaks.', 'Alternative end-joining repair pathways are the ultimate backup for abrogated classical non-homologous end-joining and homologous recombination repair: Implications for the formation of chromosome translocations.', 'Drugging IGF-1R in cancer: New insights and emerging opportunities.', 'Emerging Role of IGF-1 in Prostate Cancer: A Promising Biomarker and Therapeutic Target.', 'Mini Review: Molecular Interpretation of the IGF/IGF-1R Axis in Cancer Treatment and Stem Cells-Based Therapy in Regenerative Medicine.', 'From Therapy Resistance to Targeted Therapies in Prostate Cancer.', 'DNA Damage Responses during the Cell Cycle: Insights from Model Organisms and Beyond.']"""

Although numerous studies have investigated ERG-downstream genes, such studies have not attempted to examine miRNAs, which however are emerging to be important regulators of cancer. Through bioinformatics analysis of ChIP-Seq ERG data and miRNA expression profiling data we nominated miR-200c as a direct target of ERG. Experimentation of PCa cells with ERG overexpression or knockdown demonstrated that ERG directly repressed miR-200c expression by physically binding to the erythroblast transformation-specific (ETS) motif within its promoter. Consequently, miR-200c was downregulated in ERG-positive PCa, and miR-200c target gene expression was restored. In addition, the expression pattern of miR-200c target genes predicted ERG status in clinical PCa specimens. Furthermore, miR-200c was found to be important in modulating ZEB1 upregulation by ERG. Most importantly, miR-200c reconstitution fully reversed ERG-induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), cell migration and invasion. Therefore, our study report miR-200c as the first miRNA target of ERG and a critical inhibitor of PCa cell motility.

Overexpression of bone morphogenetic protein-6 (BMP-6) has been reported in human prostate cancer tissues. Previously we have demonstrated that BMP-6 enhances prostate cancer growth in mice and not in tissue culture. Herein, we have investigated the mechanism of BMP-6’s pro-tumorigenic effect in prostate cancer. METHODS. Tramp C2 murine and LNCaP human prostate cancer cell lines were co-cultured with RAW 264.7 and THP-1 cells, respectively. IL-1a knockout mice were used to confirm the role of BMP-6/IL-1a loop in vivo. Lastly, conditional macrophage null mice cd11b-DTR was used. RESULTS. The results demonstrated that BMP-6 induced the expression of IL-1a in macrophages via a cross-talk between NF-kB1 p50 and Smad1. When endothelial cells were treated with conditioned media harvested from macrophages incubated with BMP-6, tube formation was detected. In the presence of IL-1a neutralizing antibody, endothelial tube formation was blocked. In vivo, tumor growth and neovascularization decreased significantly when BMP-6 was expressed in IL-1a knockout and conditional macrophage-null mice. CONCLUSIONS. Prostate cancer-derived BMP-6 stimulates tumor-associated macrophages to produce IL-1a through a crosstalk between Smad1 and NF-kB1; IL-1a, in turn, promotes angiogenesis and prostate cancer growth.""","""['Seok Joo Kwon', 'Geun Taek Lee', 'Jae-Ho Lee', 'Yoichiro Iwakura', 'Wun-Jae Kim', 'Isaac Yi Kim']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Macrophages induce neuroendocrine differentiation of prostate cancer cells via BMP6-IL6 Loop.', 'Interleukin-1alpha enhances angiogenesis and is associated with liver metastatic potential in human gastric cancer cell lines.', 'The role of macrophage-derived IL-1 in induction and maintenance of angiogenesis.', 'Bombesin stimulates nuclear factor kappa B activation and expression of proangiogenic factors in prostate cancer cells.', 'Bone morphogenetic protein-6 promotes osteoblastic prostate cancer bone metastases through a dual mechanism.', 'Aberrant expression of bone morphogenetic proteins in the disease progression and metastasis of breast cancer.', 'Synergistic immunotherapy targeting cancer-associated anemia: prospects of a combination strategy.', 'Role of Cytokines and Chemokines in Angiogenesis in a Tumor Context.', 'Therapeutic Approaches Targeting Proteins in Tumor-Associated Macrophages and Their Applications in Cancers.', 'Interaction between intestinal microbiota and tumour immunity in the tumour microenvironment.']"""

Association testing was performed using multivariable logistic regression adjusted for age and genetic ancestry for 474 prostate cancer cases and 458 population-based controls on the Illumina HumanOmni-5 Quad BeadChip.

We evaluated the effect of androgen deprivation therapy on mental and emotional well-being in men with nonmetastatic prostate cancer.  Materials and methods:   Participants were enrolled in the national CaPSURE (Cancer of the Prostate Strategic Urologic Research Endeavor) registry, and treated with radical prostatectomy, external beam radiation therapy or brachytherapy with no androgen deprivation therapy (local); local with androgen deprivation therapy (combination); or primary androgen deprivation therapy. Emotional quality of life was evaluated by SF-36® social function, role emotional, vitality and mental health subscales before and up to 24 months after treatment. Subscales were assessed as continuous scores and as clinically meaningful declines of at least half a standard deviation since pretreatment. Associations between treatment and quality of life changes over time were evaluated with mixed modeling. Quality of life declines were evaluated with logistic regression.  Results:   Among 3,068 men the combination and primary androgen deprivation therapy groups were older, single, with less education and higher clinical CAPRA (Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment) score risk than the local group (all values p <0.01).

Conclusions:   Use of androgen deprivation therapy was associated with changes in mental and emotional well-being but did not result in clinically meaningful declines at 24 months.

However, to our knowledge longitudinal associations of frequency-volume chart based nocturia have not yet been studied. We identify (modifiable) determinants of nocturia in older men in a longitudinal setting.  Materials and methods:   A longitudinal, community based study was conducted among 1,688 men age 50 to 78 years in Krimpen aan den IJssel, The Netherlands with planned followup rounds at 2, 4 and 6 years. Men without a history of radical prostatectomy, transurethral surgery, or bladder or prostate cancer were included in the study. Data were obtained using frequency-volume charts, from which the nocturnal voiding frequency, maximum voided volume and (nocturnal) urine production were determined. Nocturia was defined as a nocturnal voiding frequency of 2 or more episodes. Polyuria was defined as greater than 2,800 ml voided per 24 hours. For nocturnal polyuria we used the 2 definitions of 1) greater than 33% of 24-hour voided volume and 2) nocturnal urine production of greater than 90 ml per hour. Conditions and characteristics were determined via medical examinations and questionnaires. A generalized linear mixed effect model was used to determine factors longitudinally associated with nocturia.  Results:   Age (50 to 55 years vs greater than 60 years), maximum voided volume (greater than 300 ml vs less than 300 ml), 24-hour polyuria, nocturnal polyuria (both definitions) and lower urinary tract symptoms were all longitudinally associated with an increased prevalence of nocturia in older men.  Conclusions:   A smaller maximum voided volume, lower urinary tract symptoms, 24-hour polyuria and nocturnal polyuria are significant and potentially modifiable determinants of nocturia.

This therapy often induces selection of androgen-independent PC cells with increased invasiveness. We recently demonstrated, both in cells and mice, that a testosterone metabolite locally synthetized in prostate, the 5α-androstane-3β, 17β-diol (3β-Adiol), inhibits PC cell proliferation, migration and invasion, acting as an anti-proliferative/anti-metastatic agent. 3β-Adiol is unable to bind androgen receptor (AR), but exerts its protection against PC by specifically interacting with estrogen receptor beta (ERβ). Because of its potential retro-conversion to androgenic steroids, 3β-Adiol cannot be used ""in vivo"", thus, the aims of this study were to investigate the capability of four ligands of ERβ (raloxifen, tamoxifen, genistein and curcumin) to counteract PC progression by mimicking the 3β-Adiol activity. Our results demonstrated that raloxifen, tamoxifen, genistein and curcumin decreased DU145 and PC3 cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner; in addition, all four compounds significantly decreased the detachment of cells seeded on laminin or fibronectin. Moreover, raloxifen, tamoxifen, genistein and curcumin-treated DU145 and PC3 cells showed a significant decrease in cell migration. Notably, all these effects were reversed by the anti-estrogen, ICI 182,780, suggesting that their actions are mediated by the estrogenic pathway, via the ERβ, the only isoform present in these PCs. In conclusion, these data demonstrate that by selectively activating the ERβ, raloxifen, tamoxifen, genistein and curcumin inhibit human PC cells proliferation and migration favoring cell adesion. These synthetic and natural modulators of ER action may exert a potent protective activity against the progression of PC even in its androgen-independent status.""","""['Margherita Piccolella', 'Valeria Crippa', 'Elio Messi', 'Marc J Tetel', 'Angelo Poletti']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Pharmacol Res""","""['Estrogen receptor beta and the progression of prostate cancer: role of 5alpha-androstane-3beta,17beta-diol.', 'Interaction of Androst-5-ene-3β,17β-diol and 5α-androstane-3β,17β-diol with estrogen and androgen receptors: a combined binding and cell study.', 'The androgen derivative 5alpha-androstane-3beta,17beta-diol inhibits prostate cancer cell migration through activation of the estrogen receptor beta subtype.', 'Estrogens and anti-estrogens: key mediators of prostate carcinogenesis and new therapeutic candidates.', 'Cancer therapy using natural ligands that target estrogen receptor beta.', 'The role of isoflavones in augmenting the effects of radiotherapy.', 'Chemotherapy and Physical Therapeutics Modulate Antigens on Cancer Cells.', 'Review On the Effects Curcumin on Tumors of the Reproductive System: Curcumin and Reproductive Tumors.', 'VEGFR-Mediated Cytotoxic Activity of Pulicaria undulata Isolated Metabolites: A Biological Evaluation and In Silico Study.', 'Anti-tumor activities of Panax quinquefolius saponins and potential biomarkers in prostate cancer.']"""

We aimed to introduce and validate the percentage of cancer involvement in positive cores (CIPC) as potential worse predictive factor.  Methods:   From January 2002 to December 2007, 750 consecutive subjects underwent radical prostatectomy at a single institution. We identified 147 (19.05%) patients who were eligible for AS based on PRIAS criteria: clinical stage T1c or T2 disease, prostate-specific antigen level of ≤ 10 ng/ml, Gleason score ≤ 6, prostate-specific antigen-D of<0.2 ng/ml(2), and fewer than 3 positive biopsy cores. CIPC was included in the analysis.  Results:   Of the 147 patients, 95 (66.43%) patients had favorable disease, whereas 48 (33.57%) had unfavorable disease. In multivariate logistic regression, maximum cancer length (odds ratio 12.52, P<0.01) and CIPC (odds ratio 1.70, P<0.01) represented independent predictors of unfavorable prostate cancer. The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve analysis revealed significantly higher performance after including CIPC to the PRIAS criteria (0.61 vs. 0.94, P<0.01). A cutoff of 0.4mm of CIPC was set to predict unfavorable disease with 93% specificity, 76% sensibility, and 87% accuracy based on the receiver operating characteristics curve analysis. Finally, the 3- and 5-years biochemical recurrence (BCR)-free survival were significantly lower in subjects with CIPC ≥ 0.4mm, 88.4 % and 81.0% vs. 97.8% and 95.7%, respectively (P< 0.01).

Our aim was to provide simple summary measures of changes in cancer mortality and incidence in Australia so that progress and areas for improvement in cancer control can be identified.  Methods:   We used national data on cancer deaths and newly registered cancer cases and compared expected and observed numbers of deaths and cases diagnosed in 2007. The expected numbers were obtained by applying 1987 age-sex specific rates (average of 1986-1988) directly to the 2007 population. The observed numbers of deaths and incident cases were calculated for 2007 (average of 2006-2008). We limited the analyses to people aged less than 75 years.  Results:   There was a 28% fall in cancer mortality (7827 fewer deaths in 2007 vs. 1987) and a 21% increase in new cancer diagnoses (13,012 more diagnosed cases in 2007). The greatest reductions in deaths were for cancers of the lung in males (-2259), bowel (-1797), breast (-773) and stomach (-577). Other notable falls were for cancers of the prostate (-295), cervix (-242) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (-240). Only small or no changes occurred in mortality for cancers of the lung (female only), pancreas, brain and related, oesophagus and thyroid, with an increase in liver cancer (267). Cancer types that showed the greatest increase in incident cases were cancers of the prostate (10,245), breast (2736), other cancers (1353), melanoma (1138) and thyroid (1107), while falls were seen for cancers of the lung (-1705), bladder (-1110) and unknown primary (-904).  Conclusions:   The reduction in mortality indicates that prevention strategies, improvements in cancer treatment, and screening programmes have made significant contributions to cancer control in Australia since 1987. The rise in incidence is partly due to diagnoses being brought forward by technological improvements and increased coverage of screening and early diagnostic testing.""","""['Freddy Sitas', 'Alison Gibberd', 'Clare Kahn', 'Marianne F Weber', 'May Chiew', 'Rajah Supramaniam', 'Louiza Velentzis', 'Carolyn Nickson', 'David P Smith', ""Dianne O'Connell"", 'Megan A Smith', 'Katie Armstrong', 'Xue Qin Yu', 'Karen Canfell', 'Monica Robotin', 'Eleonora Feletto', 'Andrew Penman']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Cancer Epidemiol""","""['Analysis of cancer incidence and mortality in Henan province, 2009.', 'Cancer survival and prevalence in Australia: period estimates from 1982 to 2010.', 'Cancer incidence and mortality in France over the period 1978-2000.', 'Epidemiology of cancer in the United States.', 'Cancer in Australia: Actual incidence data from 1982 to 2013 and mortality data from 1982 to 2014 with projections to 2017.', 'Changes in cancer incidence and mortality in Australia over the period 1996-2015.', 'Comparative Analysis of Breast Cancer Incidence Rates between Australia and Japan: Screening Target Implications.', 'Cancers in Australia in 2010 attributable to tobacco smoke.', 'Cancers in Australia in 2010 attributable to the consumption of alcohol.', 'An examination of prostate cancer trends in Australia, England, Canada and USA: Is the Australian death rate too high?']"""

In order to find the best suitable chelator for labelling of AMBA, we synthesized AMBA analogues linked to the most commonly used chelators DOTA, NOTA and NODAGA and compared their reactivity and stability after labelling with 68-Gallium.  Methods:   For the synthesis of DO3A-, NO2A- and NODAGA-AMBA, a solid-phase synthesis approach was used. The influence of concentration, pH and temperature on the radiolabelling was analysed. The in vitro stability of all complexes in saline, human serum, human whole blood and against transchelation and transmetallation was analysed.  Results:   The peptides were synthesised in high yield and purity. Purity and identity of products and impurities were confirmed using UHPLC coupled to ESI-MS. Radiolabelling of these peptides was optimal at elevated temperature, although room temperature labelling was reported previously for NOTA and NODAGA chelators. The highest reactivity was observed for NODAGA-AMBA. On preparation of NO2A-AMBA, the formation of a by-product was detected with HPLC. More detailed analysis revealed the formation of an isomer with the same mass to charge ratio which led to the conclusion that a coordination isomer was formed. All complexes showed high stability in saline, human serum or when challenged with DTPA, transferrin and varying metals (Fe(3+), Cu(2+), Zn(2+)). Conversely, the stability in human blood was low, and varying metabolites were detected and identified by ESI-MS.  Conclusion:   All three precursors are available in high yields suitable for routine production. NODAGA-AMBA showed the most favoured features when labelled with 68-gallium, but a further comparison in vivo should be performed in order to confirm the superior features found in vitro.""","""['Mattia Asti', 'Michele Iori', 'Pier C Capponi', 'Giulia Atti', 'Sara Rubagotti', 'René Martin', 'Albert Brennauer', 'Marco Müller', 'Ralf Bergmann', 'Paola A Erba', 'Annibale Versari']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Nucl Med Biol""","""['A comparative study of radiolabeled bombesin analogs for the PET imaging of prostate cancer.', '68Ga-labeling and in vivo evaluation of a uPAR binding DOTA- and NODAGA-conjugated peptide for PET imaging of invasive cancers.', 'The effect of macrocyclic chelators on the targeting properties of the 68Ga-labeled gastrin releasing peptide receptor antagonist PEG2-RM26.', 'Recent advances in chelator design and labelling methodology for (68) Ga radiopharmaceuticals.', 'Bifunctional Gallium-68 Chelators: Past, Present, and Future.', 'New Radiolabeled Exendin Analogues Show Reduced Renal Retention.', 'Scandium-44: Diagnostic Feasibility in Tumor-Related Angiogenesis.', 'PET Probes for Preclinical Imaging of GRPR-Positive Prostate Cancer: Comparative Preclinical Study of 68GaGa-NODAGA-AMBA and 44ScSc-NODAGA-AMBA.', '3p-C-NETA: A versatile and effective chelator for development of Al18F-labeled and therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals.', 'Development and Functional Characterization of a Versatile Radio-/Immunotheranostic Tool for Prostate Cancer Management.']"""

Materials and methods:   A retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data from the University of Southern California Prostate Cancer Database was performed. Between 1987 and 2008, 229 men underwent open RP for pT3bN0M0 prostate cancer. The cohort was divided into early (1987-1997) and contemporary (1998-2008) PSA eras. The Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional regression models were used to analyze clinical recurrence (CR) and biochemical recurrence (BCR).  Results:   The median follow-up duration was 14.5 years (range, 0.2-21.1y). The predicted 10-year freedom from CR and BCR rates for men treated in the early and contemporary PSA eras were 73% and 95% (Log-rank P = 0.001) and 65% and 73% (Log-rank P = 0.055), respectively. Multivariable analysis showed that pathologic Gleason grade 8-10 (CR: hazard ratio [HR] = 5.11; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.72-15.20; P = 0.003; BCR: HR = 3.47; 95% CI = 1.60-7.48; P = 0.002) and contemporary PSA era (CR: HR = 0.15; 95% CI = 0.06-0.41; P<0.001; BCR: HR = 0.49; 95% CI = 0.28-0.86; P = 0.013) were independently associated with cancer control.

Materials and methods:   Pareto optimal fronts (POFs) were generated for six prostate and head-and-neck cancer patients by stepwise reduction of the constraint (during the optimization process) of the primary organ-at-risk (OAR). 9-static field IMRT and 360°-single-arc VMAT plans with flattening filter (FF) and without flattening filter (FFF) were compared.

Furthermore, the number of monitor units (MUs) and measurements of the delivery time (T) were used to assess the efficiency of the treatment plans.  Results:   A significant increase in MUs was found when using FFF-beams while the treatment plan quality was at least equivalent to the FF-beams.

Despite its prevalence, there are few established risk factors for prostate cancer. Some studies have found that intake of certain foods/nutrients may be associated with prostate cancer risk, but few have accounted for how intake and metabolic factors may interact to influence bioavailable nutrient levels and subsequent disease risk.  Presentation of the hypothesis:   The composition of the gastrointestinal (GI) microbiome may influence metabolism of dietary compounds and nutrients (e.g., plant phenols, calcium, choline) that may be relevant to prostate cancer risk. We, therefore, propose the hypothesis that GI microbiota may have a markedly different composition among individuals with higher prostate cancer risk. These individuals could have microbial profiles that are conducive to intestinal inflammation and/or are less favorable for the metabolism and uptake of chemopreventive agents.  Testing the hypothesis:   Because very little preliminary data exist on this potential association, a case-control study may provide valuable information on this topic. Such a study could evaluate whether the GI microbial profile is markedly different between three groups of individuals: healthy men, those with latent prostate cancer, and those with invasive prostate cancer. Any findings could then be validated in a larger study, designed to collect a series of specimens over time.  Implications of the hypothesis:   Given the plethora of information emerging from the Human Microbiome Project, this is an opportune time to explore associations between the microbiome and complex human diseases. Identification of profiles that alter the host's risk for disease may clarify inconsistencies in the literature on dietary factors and cancer risk, and could provide valuable targets for novel cancer prevention strategies.""","""['E Susan Amirian', 'Joseph F Petrosino', 'Nadim J Ajami', 'Yanhong Liu', 'Martha P Mims', 'Michael E Scheurer']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Infect Agent Cancer""","""['More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Human microbiome and prostate cancer development: current insights into the prevention and treatment.', 'Compositional differences in gastrointestinal microbiota in prostate cancer patients treated with androgen axis-targeted therapies.', 'Systematic review of the effects of the intestinal microbiota on selected nutrients and non-nutrients.', 'The Impact of Dietary Sphingolipids on Intestinal Microbiota and Gastrointestinal Immune Homeostasis.', 'The human microbiome links to prostate cancer risk and treatment (Review).', 'Impact of intestinal dysbiosis on breast cancer metastasis and progression.', 'Exploring the Association between Gut and Urine Microbiota and Prostatic Disease including Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia and Prostate Cancer Using 16S rRNA Sequencing.', 'The Role of Microbial Factors in Prostate Cancer Development-An Up-to-Date Review.', 'The microbiome and prostate cancer.']"""

TJ was well tolerated without any gastrointestinal side effects, and increased serum lycopene levels were observed in the 8 and 12 oz groups from baseline to endpoint. No correlation between serum and dietary lycopene was detected. Despite no reported change in dietary intake, non-significant weight loss was observed in the control group but not the intervention group participants. A significant positive correlation between serum lycopene, weight, and body mass index, and a negative correlation between serum lycopene and piror nutritional supplement use was detected.

Our studies aimed to determine the expression of cabozantinib targets during PCa progression and to evaluate its efficacy in hormone-sensitive and castration-resistant PCa in preclinical models while delineating its effects on tumor and bone. Using immunohistochemistry and tissue microarrays containing normal prostate, primary PCa, and soft tissue and bone metastases, our data show that levels of MET, P-MET, and VEGFR2 are increasing during PCa progression. Our data also show that the expression of cabozantinib targets are particularly pronounced in bone metastases. To evaluate cabozantinib efficacy on PCa growth in the bone environment and in soft tissues we used androgen-sensitive LuCaP 23.1 and castration-resistant C4-2B PCa tumors. In vivo, cabozantinib inhibited the growth of PCa in bone as well as growth of subcutaneous tumors. Furthermore, cabozantinib treatment attenuated the bone response to the tumor and resulted in increased normal bone volume. In summary, the expression pattern of cabozantinib targets in primary and castration-resistant metastatic PCa, and its efficacy in two different models of PCa suggest that this agent has a strong potential for the effective treatment of PCa at different stages of the disease.""","""['Holly M Nguyen', 'Nazanin Ruppender', 'Xiaotun Zhang', 'Lisha G Brown', 'Ted S Gross', 'Colm Morrissey', 'Roman Gulati', 'Robert L Vessella', 'Frauke Schimmoller', 'Dana T Aftab', 'Eva Corey']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Cabozantinib can block growth of neuroendocrine prostate cancer patient-derived xenografts by disrupting tumor vasculature.', 'Cabozantinib inhibits prostate cancer growth and prevents tumor-induced bone lesions.', 'Integrating Murine and Clinical Trials with Cabozantinib to Understand Roles of MET and VEGFR2 as Targets for Growth Inhibition of Prostate Cancer.', 'Current role of cabozantinib in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Cabozantinib: a MET, RET, and VEGFR2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor.', 'Phase II Study of Cabozantinib in Patients With Bone Metastasis.', 'Angiogenesis as Therapeutic Target in Metastatic Prostate Cancer - Narrowing the Gap Between Bench and Bedside.', 'Antitumor Effect of Cabozantinib in Bone Metastatic Models of Renal Cell Carcinoma.', 'Reprogramming of the FOXA1 cistrome in treatment-emergent neuroendocrine prostate cancer.', 'Cabozantinib can block growth of neuroendocrine prostate cancer patient-derived xenografts by disrupting tumor vasculature.']"""

Therefore, it is crucial to reconstruct and analyze cancer-related FFLs that are controlled by transcription factor (TF) and microRNA (miRNA) simultaneously, in order to find out how miRNAs and TFs cooperate with each other in cancer cells and how they contribute to carcinogenesis. Current FFL studies rely on predicted regulation information and therefore suffer the false positive issue in prediction results. More critically, FFLs generated by existing approaches cannot represent the dynamic and conditional regulation relationship under different experimental conditions.  Methodology/principal findings:   In this study, we proposed a novel filter-wrapper feature selection method to accurately identify co-regulatory mechanism by incorporating prior information from predicted regulatory interactions with parallel miRNA/mRNA expression datasets. By applying this method, we reconstructed 208 and 110 TF-miRNA co-regulatory FFLs from human pan-cancer and prostate datasets, respectively. Further analysis of these cancer-related FFLs showed that the top-ranking TF STAT3 and miRNA hsa-let-7e are key regulators implicated in human cancers, which have regulated targets significantly enriched in cellular process regulations and signaling pathways that are involved in carcinogenesis.  Conclusions/significance:   In this study, we introduced an efficient computational approach to reconstruct co-regulatory FFLs by accurately identifying gene co-regulatory interactions. The strength of the proposed feature selection method lies in the fact it can precisely filter out false positives in predicted regulatory interactions by quantitatively modeling the complex co-regulation of target genes mediated by TFs and miRNAs simultaneously. Moreover, the proposed feature selection method can be generally applied to other gene regulation studies using parallel expression data with respect to different biological contexts.""","""['Chen Peng', 'Minghui Wang', 'Yi Shen', 'Huanqing Feng', 'Ao Li']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['MicroRNA and transcription factor co-regulatory networks and subtype classification of seminoma and non-seminoma in testicular germ cell tumors.', 'Investigating MicroRNA and transcription factor co-regulatory networks in colorectal cancer.', 'Systematic identification and analysis of dysregulated miRNA and transcription factor feed-forward loops in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.', 'Transcription factor and microRNA co-regulatory loops: important regulatory motifs in biological processes and diseases.', 'Modeling microRNA-transcription factor networks in cancer.', 'Hsa-miR-422a Originated from Short Interspersed Nuclear Element Increases ARID5B Expression by Collaborating with NF-E2.', 'Variation in the co-expression profile highlights a loss of miRNA-mRNA regulation in multiple cancer types.', 'Integrated Analysis of MicroRNA (miRNA) and mRNA Profiles Reveals Reduced Correlation between MicroRNA and Target Gene in Cancer.', 'Integrated analysis of transcription factors and targets co-expression profiles reveals reduced correlation between transcription factors and target genes in cancer.', 'Discovery of Bladder Cancer-related Genes Using Integrative Heterogeneous Network Modeling of Multi-omics Data.']"""

Because finasteride inhibits only 5αR2, we hypothesized that it would not be as efficacious in preventing prostate cancer development and/or progression in C57BL/6 TRAMP x FVB mice as dutasteride, which inhibits both 5αR1 and 5αR2.  Method/principal findings:   Six-week-old C57BL/6 TRAMP x FVB male mice were randomized to AIN93G control or pre- and post- finasteride and dutasteride diet (83.3 mg drug/kg diet) groups (n =30-33) that began at 6 and 12 weeks of age, respectively, and were terminated at 20 weeks of age. The pre- and post- finasteride and dutasteride groups were designed to test the preventive and therapeutic efficacy of the drugs, respectively. Final body weights, genitourinary tract weights, and genitourinary tract weights as percentage of body weights were significantly decreased in the Pre- and Post-dutasteride groups compared with the control. The Post-dutasteride group showed the greatest inhibition of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia progression and prostate cancer development. Surprisingly, the Post-dutasteride group showed improved outcomes compared with the Pre-dutasteride group, which had increased incidence of high-grade carcinoma as the most common and most severe lesions in a majority of prostate lobes. Consistent with our hypothesis, we found little benefit from the finasteride diets, and they increased the incidence of high-grade carcinoma.  Conclusion:   Our findings have commonalities with previously reported PCPT, REDUCE, and the Reduction by dutasteride of Clinical Progression Events in Expectant Management (REDEEM) trial results.

There are multiple full-length or near full-length HERV-K proviruses in it. To analyze which HERV-K proviruses give rise to viral transcripts in cancer cell lines and to test whether ionizing radiation can alter the levels of HERV-K transcripts, RT-PCR studies were undertaken using multiple human cancer cell lines. Primers from several positions in the viral genome were used and included pairs designed to cross splice junctions in viral RNAs. In the absence of ionizing radiation, transcripts were detected from multiple HERV-K proviruses in cell lines from human prostate, cervical, head and neck, or breast cancers, and the proviruses from which the transcripts originated varied among the different lines. Only one of 13 cell lines tested (cervical cancer line C33A) failed to show HERV-K transcripts. Spliced RNAs detected included viral RNAs spliced as expected at the conventional viral splice sites, plus several alternatively spliced RNAs. Alternatively spliced transcripts arose from specific proviruses, and were detected in most of the cell lines used. Quantitative RT-PCR was performed to assess the effects of ionizing radiation. These analyses showed that HERV-K transcripts were elevated in four of twelve lines tested, specifically all three prostate cancer lines used and one breast cancer line. The increases were transient, peaking at 24 hours following a single dose of gamma-irradiation that ranged from 2.5 to 20 Gy, and returning to baseline levels by 72 hours. In summary, these studies showed that ionizing radiation can affect the levels of HERV-K transcripts in cells, and these effects vary among different cells.

Dysregulation of ETS transcription factors is also known to exist in Ewing's sarcoma, breast cancer, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. We previously discovered that ERG, the predominant ETS family member in prostate cancer, interacts with the DNA damage response protein poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) in human prostate cancer specimens. Therefore, we hypothesized that the ERG-PARP1 interaction may confer radiation resistance by increasing DNA repair efficiency and that this radio-resistance could be reversed through PARP1 inhibition. Using lentiviral approaches, we established isogenic models of ERG overexpression in PC3 and DU145 prostate cancer cell lines. In both cell lines, ERG overexpression increased clonogenic survival following radiation by 1.25 (±0.07) fold (mean ± SEM) and also resulted in increased PARP1 activity. PARP1 inhibition with olaparib preferentially radiosensitized ERG-positive cells by a factor of 1.52 (±0.03) relative to ERG-negative cells (P < .05). Neutral and alkaline COMET assays and immunofluorescence microscopy assessing γ-H2AX foci showed increased short- and long-term efficiencies of DNA repair, respectively, following radiation that was preferentially reversed by PARP1 inhibition. These findings were verified in an in vivo xenograft model. Our findings demonstrate that ERG overexpression confers radiation resistance through increased efficiency of DNA repair following radiation that can be reversed through inhibition of PARP1. These results motivate the use of PARP1 inhibitors as radiosensitizers in patients with localized ETS fusion-positive cancers.""","""['Sumin Han', 'J Chad Brenner', 'Aaron Sabolch', 'Will Jackson', 'Corey Speers', 'Kari Wilder-Romans', 'Karen E Knudsen', 'Theodore S Lawrence', 'Arul M Chinnaiyan', 'Felix Y Feng']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Neoplasia""","""['Mechanistic rationale for inhibition of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase in ETS gene fusion-positive prostate cancer.', 'Selective radiosensitization of p53 mutant pancreatic cancer cells by combined inhibition of Chk1 and PARP1.', 'Combined inhibition of Wee1 and PARP1/2 for radiosensitization in pancreatic cancer.', 'PARP1 inhibitors: contemporary attempts at their use in anticancer therapy and future perspective.', 'The progress of TMPRSS2-ETS gene fusions and their mechanism in prostate cancer.', 'Downregulation of BUD31 Promotes Prostate Cancer Cell Proliferation and Migration via Activation of p-AKT and Vimentin In Vitro.', 'Glycyl-tRNA Synthetase (GARS) Expression Is Associated with Prostate Cancer Progression and Its Inhibition Decreases Migration, and Invasion In Vitro.', 'The Association between Cyclin Dependent Kinase 2 Associated Protein 1 (CDK2AP1) and Molecular Subtypes of Lethal Prostate Cancer.', 'Past, Current, and Future Strategies to Target ERG Fusion-Positive Prostate Cancer.', 'ARPC1B Is Associated with Lethal Prostate Cancer and Its Inhibition Decreases Cell Invasion and Migration In Vitro.']"""

Results from tissue culture experiments in prostate cancer cells suggest that PI3K inhibitors should be combined with other cytotoxic agents; however, the general toxicity of such combinations prevents translating these experimental data into preclinical and clinical models. We investigated the emerging concept of tumor-targeted synthetic lethality in prostate cancer cells by using the pan-PI3K inhibitor ZSTK474 and the immunotoxin J591PE, a protein chimera between the single-chain variable fragment of the monoclonal antibody J591 against the prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) and the truncated form of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A (PE38QQR). The combination of ZSTK474 and J591PE increased apoptosis within 6 hours and cell death (monitored at 24-48 hours) in the PSMA-expressing cells LNCaP, C4-2, and C4-2Luc but not in control cells that do not express PSMA (PC3 and BT549 cells). Mechanistic analysis suggested that induction of apoptosis requires Bcl-2-associated death promoter (BAD) dephosphorylation and decreased expression of myeloid leukemia cell differentiation protein 1 (MCL-1). A single injection of ZSTK474 and J591PE into engrafted prostate cancer C4-2Luc cells led to consistent and stable reduction of luminescence within 6 days.

In contrast, the Health Belief Model (HBM), would anticipate no increase in risk behaviors while also predicting increased health care utilization following insurance gain (because of reduced financial barriers to accessing care). Empirical studies examining the association of insurance change with changes in preventive care and health behaviors have been limited and yielded mixed findings. The objective of this study was to examine the association of health insurance change (gain or loss of coverage) with changes in preventive care and health behaviors in a large, nationally representative sample.  Methods:   We analyzed data from adults ≥18 years old and enrolled for 2 years in the 2000 to 2009 Medical Expenditure Panel Surveys (n = 76,518). Conditional logistic regression analyses modeled year-to-year individual changes in preventive care and health behaviors associated with individual changes in insurance status, adjusting for characteristics varying year to year (income, employment, total health care expenditures, office visits, prescriptions, availability of usual source of care, and health status). Preventive care included adherence to influenza vaccination, colorectal cancer screening, mammography, and Papanicolaou and prostate-specific antigen testing. Health behaviors examined were becoming nonobese, quitting smoking, and adopting consistent use of seatbelts.  Results:   Insurance gain (loss) was associated with increases (decreases) in preventive care (adjusted odds ratios [95% confidence intervals]: influenza vaccine, 1.27 [1.04-1.56]; colorectal cancer screening, 1.48 [0.96-2.29]; Papanicolaou testing, 1.56 [1.22-2.00]; mammography, 1.70 [1.21-2.38]; prostate-specific antigen, 1.42 [0.98-2.05]). Insurance change was not associated with significant changes in health behaviors.  Conclusions:   Consistent with both economic theory and the HBM, preventive care increased (decreased) after gaining (losing) coverage. In contrast, health behaviors changed little after insurance change, consistent with the HBM but not with the potential for decreased personal health care costs (ex ante moral hazard).""","""['Anthony Jerant', 'Kevin Fiscella', 'Daniel J Tancredi', 'Peter Franks']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Am Board Fam Med""","""['Health characteristics associated with gaining and losing private and public health insurance: a national study.', 'Improvement in preventive care of young adults after the affordable care act: the affordable care act is helping.', 'Satisfaction with health care providers and preventive care adherence: a national study.', 'The impact of out-of-pocket payments on prevention and health-related lifestyle: a systematic literature review.', 'The Health Belief Model: a decade later.', 'Effect of Health Insurance Uptake on Hesitancy toward COVID-19 Vaccines in Nigeria: A Recursive Bivariate Probit and Decomposition Estimation.', 'Public Perceptions of Breast Implant Complications and the FDA Boxed Warning on Implants.', 'Does health literacy affect the uptake of annual physical check-ups?: Results from the 2017 US health information national trends survey.', 'Knowledge, Attitudes, Practices and Information Needs During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Indonesia.', 'Influenza vaccination among U.S. pediatric patients receiving care from federally funded health centers.']"""

Materials and methods:   Ten patients with histologically confirmed prostate cancer underwent three sequential dynamic [C]choline-PET/CT pelvic scans: at baseline, after NAD and 4 months after RT-CAD. [C]Choline uptake was quantified using the average and maximum standardized uptake values at 60 min (SUV60,ave and SUV60,max), the tumour-to-muscle ratios (TMR60,max) and net irreversible retention of [C]choline at steady state (Kimod-pat).  Results:   The combination of NAD and RT-CAD significantly decreased tumour [C]choline uptake (SUV60,ave, SUV60,max, TMR60,max or Kimod-pat) and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels (analysis of variance, P<0.001 for all variables). Although the magnitude of reduction in the variables was larger after NAD, there was a smaller additional reduction after RT-CAD. A wide range of reduction in tumour SUV60,ave (38-83.7%) and SUV60,max (22.2-85.3%) was seen with combined NAD and RT-CAD despite patients universally achieving PSA suppression (narrow range of 93.5-99.7%). There was good association between baseline SUV60,max and initial PSA levels (Pearson's r=0.7, P=0.04). The reduction in tumour SUV60,ave after NAD was associated with PSA reduction (r=0.7, P=0.04). This association occurred despite the larger reduction in PSA (94%) compared with SUV60,ave (58%).  Conclusion:   This feasibility study shows that [C]choline-PET/CT detects metabolic changes within tumours following NAD and RT-CAD to the prostate. A differential reduction in [C]choline uptake despite a global reduction in PSA following NAD and RT-CAD could provide prognostic information and warrants further evaluation as an imaging biomarker in this setting.""","""['Amarnath Challapalli', 'Tara Barwick', 'Giampaolo Tomasi', ""Michael O' Doherty"", 'Kaiyumars Contractor', 'Simon Stewart', 'Adil Al-Nahhas', 'Kevin Behan', 'Charles Coombes', 'Eric O Aboagye', 'Stephen Mangar']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Nucl Med Commun""","""['Biological basis of ¹¹Ccholine-positron emission tomography in patients with breast cancer: comparison with ¹⁸Ffluorothymidine positron emission tomography.', 'Early biochemical relapse after radical prostatectomy: which prostate cancer patients may benefit from a restaging 11C-Choline PET/CT scan before salvage radiation therapy?', 'PSA doubling time for prediction of (11)Ccholine PET/CT findings in prostate cancer patients with biochemical failure after radical prostatectomy.', 'The role of choline positron emission tomography/computed tomography in the management of patients with prostate-specific antigen progression after radical treatment of prostate cancer.', 'EAU guidelines on prostate cancer.

We also examined a novel miRNA-based biomarker source called expressed prostatic secretions in urine (EPS urine) for miR-888 expression and found that its levels were preferentially elevated in prostate cancer patients with high-grade disease. These expression studies indicated a correlation for miR-888 in disease progression. We next tested how miR-888 regulated cancer-related pathways in vitro using human prostate cancer cell lines. Overexpression of miR-888 increased proliferation and migration, and conversely inhibition of miR-888 activity blocked these processes. miR-888 also increased colony formation in PC3-N and LNCaP cells, supporting an oncogenic role for this miRNA in the prostate.

In volumetric modulated arc radiotherapy (VMAT) non-coplanar geometries are generally achieved by applying patient couch rotations to single or multiple full or partial arcs. This paper presents a trajectory optimization method for a non-coplanar technique, dynamic couch rotation during VMAT (DCR–VMAT), which combines ray tracing with a graph search algorithm. Four clinical test cases (partial breast, brain, prostate only, and prostate and pelvic nodes) were used to evaluate the potential OAR sparing for trajectory-optimized DCR–VMAT plans, compared with standard coplanar VMAT. In each case, ray tracing was performed and a cost map reflecting the number of OAR voxels intersected for each potential source position was generated. The least-cost path through the cost map, corresponding to an optimal DCR–VMAT trajectory, was determined using Dijkstra's algorithm. Results show that trajectory optimization can reduce dose to specified OARs for plans otherwise comparable to conventional coplanar VMAT techniques. For the partial breast case, the mean heart dose was reduced by 53%. In the brain case, the maximum lens doses were reduced by 61% (left) and 77% (right) and the globes by 37% (left) and 40% (right). Bowel mean dose was reduced by 15% in the prostate only case. For the prostate and pelvic nodes case, the bowel V50 Gy and V60 Gy were reduced by 9% and 45% respectively.

With new systemic therapies available, the optimal treatment sequence of these drugs in mCRPC becomes increasingly important. As shown recently, patients who had previously been treated with abiraterone showed impaired responses to docetaxel, suggesting clinical cross-resistance [1]. In the present study, we aimed to identify cross-resistance between taxanes (docetaxel and cabazitaxel) and the new hormonal agents abiraterone and enzalutamide. As a potential mechanism for cross-resistance, we investigated the effects on androgen receptor (AR) nuclear translocation of these compounds.  Methods:   To identify cross-resistance, we determined the effects of docetaxel, cabazitaxel, abiraterone and enzalutamide on cell viability in prostate cancer cell lines with acquired resistance to abiraterone and enzalutamide. Time-lapse confocal microscopy was used to study the dynamics of AR nuclear translocation.  Results:   We observed impaired efficacy of docetaxel, cabazitaxel and enzalutamide in the abiraterone-resistant cell line, compared to the non-resistant cell line, providing evidence for in vitro cross-resistance. Impaired efficacy of docetaxel, cabazitaxel and abiraterone was observed in the enzalutamide-resistant cell line. Furthermore, docetaxel and cabazitaxel inhibited AR nuclear translocation, which was also observed for abiraterone and enzalutamide.  Conclusions:   In conclusion we found substantial preclinical evidence for cross-resistance between the taxanes docetaxel and cabazitaxel, and AR targeting agents abiraterone and enzalutamide.

Deregulation of histone methyltransferases (HMTs) or demethylases (HDMs) has been associated with PCa development and progression. However, the precise influence of altered HMTs or HDMs expression and respective histone marks in PCa onset and progression remains largely unknown. To clarify the role of HMTs and HDMs in prostate carcinogenesis, expression levels of 37 HMTs and 20 HDMs were assessed in normal prostate and PCa tissue samples by RT-qPCR. SMYD3, SUV39H2, PRMT6, KDM5A, and KDM6A were upregulated, whereas KMT2A-E (MLL1-5) and KDM4B were downregulated in PCa, compared with normal prostate tissues. Remarkably, PRMT6 was the histone modifier that best discriminated normal from tumorous tissue samples. Interestingly, EZH2 and SMYD3 expression levels significantly correlated with less differentiated and more aggressive tumors. Remarkably, SMYD3 expression levels were of independent prognostic value for the prediction of disease-specific survival of PCa patients with clinically localized disease submitted to radical prostatectomy.

Materials and methods:   Forty-three patients with PCa and thirty-six patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) underwent diffusion-weighted (DW) imaging on 3T magnetic resonance (MR) with pelvic phased-array coil. The ADC values of PCa were calculated from two DW images (b = 0, 800 s/mm(2)). Immunohistochemical staining for Ki-67 was used to determine the Ki-67 SI of PCa and BPH. The Pearson correlation test was used to examine the relationship between ADC values and the Ki-67 SI. The ADC values of PCa with different level of Ki-67 SI were compared using an independent-sample t-test.  Results:   The mean (±standard deviation [SD]) Ki-67 SI of PCa (7.23 ± 5.29%) was higher than that of BPH (2.11 ± 1.90%) (P < .001). The mean (±SD) ADC value (10(-3) mm(2)/s) of PCa (0.850 ± 0.155) was lower than that of BPH (1.173 ± 0.245) (P < .001). The ADC values of PCa were negatively correlated with the Ki-67 SI (r = -0.459, P = .002). The mean ADC values of PCa with Ki-67 >3.5% and ≤3.5% were (0.803 ± 0.094) and (0.936 ± 0.208), respectively. The former was significantly lower than the latter (P = .031).

However, the clinical utility of AA at a tolerable dosage is plagued by a relatively low in vivo efficacy. This study describes the development of a peroxidase-like composite nanoparticle for use in an AA-mediated therapeutic strategy. On the basis of a high-throughput, one-pot solvothermal approach, Fe3O4@C nanoparticles (NPs) were synthesized and then modified with folic acid (FA) on the surface. Particular focus is concentrated on the assessment of peroxidase-like catalytic activity by a chromogenic reaction in the presence of H2O2. The carbon shell of Fe3O4@C NPs contains partially graphitized carbon and thus facilitates electron transfer in the catalytic decomposition of H2O2, leading to the production of highly reactive hydroxyl radicals. Along with magnetic responsiveness and receptor-binding specificity, the intrinsic peroxidase-like catalytic activity of Fe3O4@C-FA NPs pronouncedly promotes AA-induced oxidative stress in cancer cells and optimizes the ROS-mediated antineoplastic efficacy of exogenous AA. In vitro experiments using human prostate cancer PC-3 cells demonstrate that Fe3O4@C-FA NPs serve as a peroxidase mimic to create hydroxyl radicals from endogenous H2O2 that is yielded in response to exogenous AA via an oxidative stress process. The usage of a dual agent leads to the enhanced cytotoxicity of PC-3 cells, and, because of the synergistic effect of NPs, the administrated dosage of AA is reduced markedly. However, because normal cells (HEK 293T cells) appear to have a higher capacity to cope with additionally generated ROS than cancer cells, the NP-AA combination shows little damage in this case, proving that selective killing of cancer cells could be achieved owing to preferential accumulation of ROS in cancer cells. A possible ROS-mediated mechanism is discussed to elucidate the pharmaceutical profile of the NP-AA agent. In general, this foundational study reveals that the peroxidase-like nanomaterials are applicable for modulating oxidative stress for the selective treatment of cancer cells by generating a high level of endogenous ROS.""","""['Qiao An', 'Chuanyu Sun', 'Dian Li', 'Ke Xu', 'Jia Guo', 'Changchun Wang']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""ACS Appl Mater Interfaces""","""['Polyethyleneimine-mediated synthesis of folic acid-targeted iron oxide nanoparticles for in vivo tumor MR imaging.', 'Cancer cell detection and therapeutics using peroxidase-active nanohybrid of gold nanoparticle-loaded mesoporous silica-coated graphene.', 'Specific targeting of cancer cells by multifunctional mitoxantrone-conjugated magnetic nanoparticles.', 'Free radicals, metals and antioxidants in oxidative stress-induced cancer.', 'Therapeutic strategies by modulating oxygen stress in cancer and inflammation.', 'Exploration of nanozymes in viral diagnosis and therapy.', 'Fe3O4 Nanoparticles in Combination with 5-FU Exert Antitumor Effects Superior to Those of the Active Drug in a Colon Cancer Cell Model.', 'Functionalized Magnetite Nanoparticles: Characterization, Bioeffects, and Role of Reactive Oxygen Species in Unicellular and Enzymatic Systems.', 'New Insight into Assembled Fe3O4@PEI@Ag Structure as Acceptable Agent with Enzymatic and Photothermal Properties.', 'Controllable synthesis of variable-sized magnetic nanocrystals self-assembled into porous nanostructures for enhanced cancer chemo-ferroptosis therapy and MR imaging.']"""

The self-renewal, tumor-homing ability and low immunogenicity of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) make them potential delivery candidates for suicide genes for anti-tumor therapy. However, unstable supply and short life span of adult MSCs in vitro have limited this therapeutic potential. In this study, we aimed to evaluate if immortalization of human fetal bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells by simian virus 40 (SV40-hfBMSCs) could be a stable source of MSCs for clinical application of suicide gene therapy.  Methods and results:   Transduction of SV40 and herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase-IRES-green fluorescent protein (TK-GFP) did not cause significant change in the stem cell properties of hfBMSCs. The anti-tumor effect of SV40-TK-hfBMSCs in the presence of the prodrug ganciclovir was demonstrated in vitro and in nude mice bearing human prostate cancer cells, DU145 and PC3, which had been transduced with luciferase and GFP for imaging evaluation by an in vivo live imaging system (IVIS 200 imaging system; Caliper Life Sciences). Repeated injection of low doses (1 × 10(6) cells/kg) of SV40-TK-hfBMSCs was as effective as previously reported and did not cause observable harmful side effects in multiple organs. Mixed lymphocyte reaction showed that SV40-TK-hfBMSCs did not induce significant proliferation of lymphocytes isolated from healthy adults.

In multiple xenograft models of human cancer, modeling of tumor-associated USP22 deregulation demonstrated that USP22 controls androgen receptor accumulation and signaling, and that it enhances expression of critical target genes coregulated by androgen receptor and MYC. USP22 not only reprogrammed androgen receptor function, but was sufficient to induce the transition to therapeutic resistance. Notably, in vivo depletion experiments revealed that USP22 is critical to maintain phenotypes associated with end-stage disease. This was a significant finding given clinical evidence that USP22 is highly deregulated in tumors, which have achieved therapeutic resistance.

The currently available guidelines on diagnosis and treatment of urogenital cancer do not provide the clinician with evidence-based recommendations for daily routine. It is the aim of the current manuscript to develop scientifically valid recommendations with regard to the most appropriate imaging technique and the most useful time interval in metastatic urogenital cancer patients undergoing systemic therapy.  Results:   Therapeutic response of soft tissue metastases is evaluated with the use of the RECIST criteria. In skeletal metastases, bone scans with validated algorithms must be performed to assess response. In patients with testicular germ cell tumors, computed tomography (CT) of the chest, the retroperitoneum, and the abdomen represents the standard imaging technique of choice usually performed prior to and at the end of systemic chemotherapy. Only in seminomas with residual tumors > 3 cm in diameter should FDG-PET/CT be performed about 6 weeks after chemotherapy. Metastatic renal cell carcinomas treated with molecular targeted therapies are routinely evaluated by CT scans at 3 month intervals. In specific cases, FDG-PET/CT is able to predict responses as early as 8 weeks after initiation of treatment. In patients with metastatic urothelial carcinomas, imaging studies should be performed after every second cycle of cytotoxic therapy. In patients with metastatic prostate cancer, the modality and the frequency of imaging studies depends on the type of the treatment. In men undergoing androgen deprivation therapy, no routine imaging studies are recommended except for patients with new onset symptoms or significant PSA progression prior to change of treatment. In men with metastatic castration-resistant PCA who are treated with cytotoxic regimes, routine imaging studies in the presence of decreasing or stable PSA serum concentrations are not indicated. In men treated with lyase inhibitor or inhibitors of the androgen receptor signaling cascade, imaging studies should be performed at 3 month intervals due to the low correlation of PSA serum concentrations with clinical response.  Conclusions:   Imaging studies to assess therapeutic response to systemic treatment in metastatic cancers of the urogenital tract must be chosen depending on the treatment regime, primary organ, and potential consequences of the findings.

Methods:   Thirty semi-structured interviews were conducted with men and, where possible, their partner. Data were analyzed with reference to framework analysis.  Results:   Relationships, including spousal, familial, and friendships, appear pivotal in informing men's help-seeking behaviors. Friends and partners were often critical in facilitating access to primary care. Following their own diagnosis, this virtuous cycle of encouragement led many men to encourage others to seek medical attention for prostate tests.  Conclusions:   Interpersonal relationships are a missing dimension in models of delay.

Methods:   Since 2005, 150 consecutive patients were treated with primary radiotherapy for localized prostate cancer. Intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) using the simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) technique was practiced in all patients and doses of 73.9 Gy (n = 41) and 76.2 Gy (n = 109) were delivered in 32 and 33 fractions, respectively. The pelvic lymph nodes were treated in 41 high-risk patients. Treatment was delivered using cone-beam CT based image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT). Toxicity was assessed prospectively using CTCAE 3.0; biochemical failure was defined according to the Phoenix definition of nadir + 2 ng/ml.  Results:   Median follow-up of living patients was 50 months. Gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity was mild with > 80% of the patients free from any GI toxicity during follow-up and no time trend to increased rates or to higher grade of GI toxicity. Two patients suffered from late grade 3 GI toxicity. Acute genitourinary (GU) toxicity grade 1-2 was observed in 85% of the patients; most patients recovered quickly within 6 weeks after treatment. The rate of GU toxicity grade ≥ 2 was <10% at 6-12 month but increased continuously to 22.4% at 60 months; grade 3 GU toxicity remained below 5% during follow-up. The 5-year freedom from biochemical failure (FFBF) was 82% for all patients and 88, 80, and 78% for low-, intermediate-, and high-risk disease.  Conclusion:   Favorable FFBF with simultaneously low rates of toxicity was observed after moderately hypofractionated radiotherapy with 2 Gy-equivalent doses ≥ 80 Gy.

In this study, we have developed a novel one-step method for sensitive and specific miRNA detection via enzymatic signal amplification and demonstrated its practical application in biological samples. The proposed signal amplification strategy is an integrated ""biological circuit"" designed to initiate a cascade of enzymatic polymerization reactions in order to detect, amplify, and measure a specific miRNA sequence by using the isothermal strand-displacement property of a mesophilic DNA polymerase together with the nicking activity of a restriction endonuclease. The circuit is composed of two molecular switches operating in series: the nicking endonuclease-assisted isothermal polymerization reaction activated by a specific miRNA and the strand-displacement polymerization reaction designed to initiate molecular beacon-assisted amplification and signal transduction. The hsa-miR-141 (miR-141) was chosen as a target miRNA because its level specifically elevates in prostate cancer. The proposed method allowed quantitative sequence-specific detection of miR-141 in a dynamic range from 1 fM to 100 nM, with an excellent ability to discriminate differences among miR-200 family members. Moreover, the detection assay was applied to quantify miR-141 in cancerous cell lysates. The results are in excellent agreement with those from the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction method. On the basis of these findings, we believe that this proposed sensitive and specific assay has great potential as a miRNA quantification method for use in biomedical research and clinical diagnosis.""","""['Bin-Cheng Yin', 'Yu-Qiang Liu', 'Bang-Ce Ye']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Anal Chem""","""['Sensitive detection of microRNA in complex biological samples by using two stages DSN-assisted target recycling signal amplification method.', 'Highly sensitive detection of microRNAs based on isothermal exponential amplification-assisted generation of catalytic G-quadruplex DNAzyme.', 'Isothermal nucleic acid amplification strategy by cyclic enzymatic repairing for highly sensitive microRNA detection.', 'Isothermal amplified detection of DNA and RNA.', 'Nucleic acid isothermal amplification technologies: a review.', 'Recent advances and challenges of biosensing in point-of-care molecular diagnosis.', 'An CuInS2 photocathode for the sensitive photoelectrochemical determination of microRNA-21 based on DNA-protein interaction and exonuclease III assisted target recycling amplification.', 'T4 DNA polymerase-assisted upgrade of a nicking/polymerization amplification strategy for ultrasensitive electrochemical detection of Watermelon mosaic virus.', 'A novel ultrasensitive ECL sensor for DNA detection based on nicking endonuclease-assisted target recycling amplification, rolling circle amplification and hemin/G-quadruplex.']"""

The enzyme topoisomerase 2β (TOP2B) mediating DNA processing, plays an important role in DNA cleavage. The aim of this study was to analyse expression of AR, TOP2B and ERG in relation to TMPRSS2-ERG gene rearrangement and relevant clinicopathological characteristics in prostate cancer (CaP). Immunohistochemical staining and FISH were used for investigation. ERG expression in prostate cell lesions positively correlated with levels of TMPRSS2-ERG fusion gene (p<0.0001). The most significant co-expression of ERG was found with AR in CaP (p=0.001). Significantly more frequent co-expression of ERG was also revealed with TOP2B (p=0.028). ERG protein expression did not correlate with CaP differentiation status as we found no significant differences in ERG expression for different Gleason categories. We demonstrated a statistically significant positive correlation between the percentage of cells with fusion gene TMPRSS2-ERG in CaP and metastatic potential of tumors (p=0.011). Besides these positive corelations of AR with ERG (p=0.001) and TOP2B with ERG (p=0.028), we also demonstrated a significant co-expression of AR with TOP2B (p=0.007) in CaP. There was a statistically significant increase in the TOP2B H-index in locally advanced CaP in comparison with localized tumors (p=0.046). ERG expression correlates with occurrence of TMPRSS2-ERG fusion and with AR-driven malignant transformation. The results indicate that detection of the TMPRSS2-ERG fusion gene and parallel immunohistochemical examination of AR, TOP2B and ERG has diagnostic significance and may be useful in assessing the biological character of the prostate cancer as well as selecting the best treatment.""","""['Z Kolar', 'A Burdova', 'T Jamaspishvili', 'J Bouchal', 'R Kucerova', 'M Bienova', 'M Kral', 'V Student']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Neoplasma""","""['TMPRSS2:ERG fusion by translocation or interstitial deletion is highly relevant in androgen-dependent prostate cancer, but is bypassed in late-stage androgen receptor-negative prostate cancer.', 'Increased androgen receptor gene copy number is associated with TMPRSS2-ERG rearrangement in prostatic small cell carcinoma.', 'CXCR4 mRNA overexpression in high grade prostate tumors: lack of association with TMPRSS2-ERG rearrangement.', 'The prognostic and predictive value of TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion and ERG protein expression in prostate cancer biopsies.', 'The progress of TMPRSS2-ETS gene fusions and their mechanism in prostate cancer.', 'Correlation between ERG Fusion Protein and Androgen Receptor Expression by Immunohistochemistry in Prostate, Possible Role in Diagnosis and Therapy.', 'TMPRSS2:ERG Gene Fusions in Prostate Cancer of West African Men and a Meta-Analysis of Racial Differences.', 'Src promotes castration-recurrent prostate cancer through androgen receptor-dependent canonical and non-canonical transcriptional signatures.', 'Topoisomerase IIβ mediates the resistance of glioblastoma stem cells to replication stress-inducing drugs.', 'DNA damage signalling barrier, oxidative stress and treatment-relevant DNA repair factor alterations during progression of human prostate cancer.']"""

To bridge this gap, we aimed to determine a short-term projection method for cancer incidence.  Methods:   Data between 1985 and 2007 were obtained from the population-based cancer registries in four prefectures (Miyagi, Yamagata, Fukui and Nagasaki). Three projection models were examined: generalized linear model with age and period (A + P linear); generalized linear model with age, period and their interactions (A*P linear); and generalized additive model with age, period and their interactions smoothed by spline (A*P spline). We performed a 5-year projection for the years 2000 and 2005, based on the data of 1985-95 and 1985-2000, respectively. Seven cancer sites (stomach, liver, colorectal, lung, female breast, cervix uteri and prostate) and all cancers combined were analyzed. The accuracy of projection was evaluated by whether each observed number fell within the 95% confidence interval of the projected number.  Results:   The A*P spline model accurately projected 8 of 13 cancer site-sex combinations, whereas the number of site-sex combinations of accurate projection was 2 and 6 for A + P linear and A*P linear models, respectively. For liver and colorectal cancers, the A*P spline model alone performed accurate projections; the relative differences between projected and observed numbers of cancer incidence ranged between -0.4 and +10.9% for the A*P spline, and between +7.4 and +37.6% for the other two models. All three models failed to project sudden increases in prostate cancer between 2000 and 2005.  Conclusions:   The A*P spline model is a candidate method for the projection of cancer incidence in Japan.

To this end, a capsid-optimized adeno-associated virus serotype 6 (AAV6-T492V+S663V) vector was developed by site-directed mutagenesis of surface-exposed serine (S) and threonine (T) residues, which have a critical role in intracellular trafficking of AAV vectors. This double-mutant AAV6 vector had ∼ 5-fold greater transduction efficiency in monocyte-derived DCs (moDCs) compared with wild-type (WT)-AAV6 vectors. The increase in the transduction efficiency correlated with the improved nuclear translocation of AAV6-T492V+S663V over that of the WT-AAV6 vector. Additional studies of the CD11c promoter identified critical regulatory elements that fit into the AAV expression cassette and drive EGFP expression in moDCs. Development of a chimeric promoter (chmCD11c) that contains functional modules of CD11c and a Simian virus (SV40) enhancer element dramatically increased the EGFP expression in moDCs. MoDCs transduced by the capsid-optimized AAV6 vector carrying human prostate-specific antigen (hPSA) driven by CBA (AAV6-T492V+S663V-CBA-hPSA) or chmCd11c (AAV6-T492V+S663V-chmCD11c-hPSA) generated specific T-cell clone proliferation and superior cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) with higher killing capability against human prostate adenocarcinoma cells, LNCaP, compared with WT-AAV6 induced CTLs. Taken together, these studies suggest that optimization of capsid and promoter components of AAV vectors can be a useful approach for efficient targeting of moDCs and may prove to be a promising tool for cancer immunotherapy.""","""['Jheel Pandya', 'Luis Ortiz', 'Chen Ling', 'Angela E Rivers', 'George Aslanidi']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Immunol Cell Biol""","""['Reprogramming Immune Response With Capsid-Optimized AAV6 Vectors for Immunotherapy of Cancer.', 'Development of novel AAV serotype 6 based vectors with selective tropism for human cancer cells.', 'Enhanced transduction of mouse bone marrow-derived dendritic cells by repetitive infection with self-complementary adeno-associated virus 6 combined with immunostimulatory ligands.', 'Prospects and limitations of recombinant poxviruses for prostate cancer immunotherapy.', 'Prostate cancer gene therapy.', 'Technological advances in the use of viral and non-viral vectors for delivering genetic and non-genetic cargos for cancer therapy.', 'Extracellular vesicles enhance pulmonary transduction of stably associated adeno-associated virus following intratracheal\xa0administration.', 'Capsid-modified adeno-associated virus vectors as novel vaccine platform for cancer immunotherapy.', 'On the way to developing AAV-based vaccines as novel tools for cancer immunotherapy.', 'Tumor antigen-loaded AAV vaccine drives protective immunity in a melanoma animal model.']"""

The abnormal expression of clusterin is closely related to the occurrence, progression, and prognosis of tumors. Up to now, few studies have focused on clusterin in human testicular cancer. This study describes an extensive exploration of the presence and expression of clusterin in testicular seminoma.  Methods:   Tumor tissues and normal testis tissues were collected from 13 patients with testicular seminoma and 16 patients undergoing surgical castration for prostate cancer. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed to detect the expression difference of clusterin mRNA between testicular seminoma and normal testis. Western blot and immunohistochemical analysis were performed to detect the presence and expression difference of clusterin protein between two groups.  Results:   Real-time PCR showed the expression of clusterin mRNA in testicular seminoma to be significantly lower than in normal testis (only 13% relative quantification). Western blot analysis indicated marked reductions in the expression of clusterin protein in testicular seminoma. Similar results were observed upon immunohistochemical analysis.

These recommendations are based on retrospective investigations only. In addition, BS has most often been reported as a definitive investigation with no room for equivocal cases.  Objective:   The objective of this study was to determine the diagnostic value of BS in a large cohort of consecutive patients with newly diagnosed PCa.  Design, setting, and participants:   Over a period of 1.5 years in 2008 to 2009, consecutive patients with newly diagnosed PCa were enrolled in a noninterventional, multicenter, observational study. All patients had a whole-body, planar BS. Clinical history and clinical, pathological, and biochemical data were obtained from electronic patient files and questionnaires.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Bone scintigraphy was classified into 4 categories as nonmalignant, equivocal, likely malignant, or multiple metastasis. The primary end point was final imaging, which was a composite end point of BS and additional CT and MRI investigations.  Results and limitations:   A total of 635 eligible patients were recruited. Their median prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was 15 ng/mL, median Gleason was 7, and 80% of patients had local disease (T1 or T2). The proportion of nonmalignant BS was 61%, equivocal scans 26%, and likely or definitive metastasis 13%. A total of 154 patients had additional CT or MRI investigations. The final imaging diagnosis showed a prevalence of bone metastases in 87 (13.7%) of 635 patients. No bone metastases were observed in (1) patients with PSA of less than 10 ng/mL, independently of the clinical Tstage and Gleason score (n = 212) and (2) PSA of less than 20 ng/mL if Tstage is less than T3 and Gleason score is less than 8 (n = 97).

The objective of this study is to gain insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying angiogenesis, and to elucidate the role of osteopontin in this process. We report here that osteopontin/αvβ3 signaling pathway which involves ERK1/2 phosphorylation regulates the expression of VEGF. An inhibitor to MEK or curcumin significantly suppressed the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and expression of VEGF. MMP9 knockdown reduces the secretion but not the expression of VEGF. Moreover, MMP9 knockdown increases the release of angiostatin, a key protein that suppresses angiogenesis. Conditioned media from PC3 cells treated with curcumin or MEK inhibitor inhibited tube formation in vitro in human microvascular endothelial cells. Similar inhibitory effect on tube formation was found with conditioned media collected from PC3 cells expressing mutant-osteopontin at integrin-binding site and knockdown of osteopontin or MMP9. We conclude that MMP9 activation is associated with angiogenesis via regulation of secretion of VEGF and angiostatin in PC3 cells.

We found that the frequencies of somatic mutations in the TERT promoter varied substantially between different types of urogenital tumors (range: 0-63.7%), with urothelial carcinomas showing the highest mutation frequency and prostate cancer showing no mutation. The mutations upregulated the expression of TERT and enhanced the invasiveness of the tumor cells. The mutations were more prevalent in older patients with invasive diseases and advanced tumor stages, and were associated with significantly shorter survival time.

Yet the effect of screening is controversial, and in some instances may not be beneficial. Previous studies have typically only reported outcomes of treatment and symptoms within a short time frame following treatment. The persistence of such symptoms over time necessitates an improvement of survivor care so that the medical and support needs of these patients are met.  Objective:   This study aims to perform a patient-centered survey of prostate cancer survivors in the Michigan Cancer Registry to identify treatment side effect rates, evaluate survivors' access to preventive care services post-prostate cancer treatment, and assess the informational needs of these survivors regarding their prostate cancer.  Design, setting, and patients:   Linking case files of the Michigan Cancer Registry with records from the National Death Index, we identified prostate cancer patients diagnosed between 1985 and 2004 and alive on 31 December 2005. Participants were selected using a stratified cross-sectional sampling strategy to ensure adequate inclusion of survivors based upon race and ethnicity, urban versus rural location, and number of years since diagnosis of prostate cancer. A total of 2,499 surveys were completed and returned.  Main outcome measures:   (1) Physical symptoms--assessing bowel, sexual, urinary, and vitality symptoms by treatment modality. (2) Access to care--identifying whether diagnostic tests for prostate cancer (prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and digital rectal examination) were performed. Determining whether the survivors had knowledge of the ""watchful waiting"" paradigm for prostate cancer surveillance. (3) Informational needs--assessing whether the informational needs of patients were addressed by providers. Evaluating the significant predictors associated with seeking information about prostate cancer from any other source. Identifying what factors influenced a person to actively seek out information and what factors guide which primary information source a survivor would use.  Results:   Median duration between prostate cancer diagnosis and survey response was 9 years. Of the study population, 80 % was diagnosed at an early stage. Survivors had reported significant problems in the 4 weeks prior to survey. Of the survivors, 88.1 % reported having a PSA test since diagnosis of prostate cancer, with 93 % of them having it done at least once per year. Of the survivors, 82.6 % reported that a healthcare provider gave them information on prostate cancer. Of this 82.6 %, 86.4 % had this information provided by a urologist, 45.4 % by a primary care physician, and 29.2 % by an oncologist. The primary source of information for these survivors was ""healthcare provider"" (59.2 %).  Conclusion:   Persistent symptoms subsequent to prostate cancer treatment suggest a gap in symptom management. Future research should support long-term studies of active surveillance versus active treatment outcomes to understand the feasibility of minimizing the burden of long-term physical symptoms arising from prostate cancer treatment. Clinicians must assess post-treatment distress long after treatment has ended to identify when supportive care is needed. More informational resources should be allocated to prostate cancer survivors to ensure that they are well-educated about their prognosis.

However, the infusion of a T-cell product targeting a single tumor-associated antigen may lead to target antigen modulation under this selective pressure, with subsequent tumor immune escape. With the purpose of preventing this phenomenon, we have studied the impact of simultaneously targeting two distinct antigens present on tumor cells: namely mucin 1 and prostate stem cell antigen, both of which are expressed in a variety of solid tumors, including pancreatic and prostate cancer.

As a combination therapy, we demonstrate superior antitumor effects using both CARs simultaneously, but this was nevertheless insufficient to achieve a complete response.

To address the function of SCIN in prostate carcinoma cells, we used lentivirus-mediated RNAi to knock down SCIN expression in PC3 cells, a prostate carcinoma cell line. We found that in vitro silencing of SCIN could inhibit the proliferation and colony formation ability of PC3 cells. Furthermore, cell cycle analysis showed that reduced SCIN expression lead to G0/G1 cell cycle arrest through the regulation of cell cycle-related genes, such as p21Waf1/Cip1, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A, p16Ink4A) and cyclin A2.

This is achieved through a mathematical model of cancer progression accounting for the growth of the primary tumor, shedding of metastases, their dormancy and growth at secondary sites. To describe dynamics of the primary tumor, we used the Gompertz law, a parsimonious model of tumor growth accounting for its saturation. Parameters of the model were estimated from the age and volume of the primary tumor at surgery and volumes of detectable bone metastases collected from one breast cancer patient and one prostate cancer patient. This allowed us to estimate, for each patient, the ages at cancer onset and inception of all detected metastases, the expected metastasis latency time, parameters of the Gompertzian growth of the primary tumor, and the rates of growth of metastases before and after surgery. We found that for both patients: (1) onset of metastasis occurred when primary tumor was undetectable; (2) inception of all surveyed metastases except one occurred before surgery; and most importantly, (3) resection of the primary tumor led to a dramatic increase in the rate of growth of metastases. The model provides an excellent fit to the observed volumes of bone metastases in both patients. Our results agree well with those obtained previously based on exponential growth of the primary tumor, which serves as model validation. Our findings support the notion of metastatic dormancy and indirectly confirm the existence of stem-like cancer cells in breast and prostate tumors. We also explored the logistic law of primary tumor growth; however, it degenerated into the exponential law for both patients analyzed.

Previously, we demonstrated that interaction of breast cancer cells with endothelial cells leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of VE-cadherin and disruption of endothelial adherens junction (EAJ). The molecular mechanism underlying the anti-metastatic effects of mushroom-derived active hexode correlated compound (AHCC) remains elusive.  Main methods:   Several cellular and biochemical techniques were used to determine the contribution of oxidative stress in the disruption of EAJ and to test this hypothesis that AHCC inhibits the breast cancer cell-induced disruption of EAJ.  Key findings:   Interaction of breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231 cells) with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) leads to an increase in generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Treatment of HUVECs with H2O2 or phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) led to tyrosine phosphorylation of VE-cadherin, dissociation of β-catenin from VE-cadherin complex and increased transendothelial migration (TEM) of MDA-MB-231 cells. Induction of VE-cadherin tyrosine phosphorylation by PMA or by interaction of MDA-MB-231 cells with HUVECs was mediated by HRas and protein kinase C-α signaling pathways. Disruption of EAJ and phosphorylation of VE-cadherin induced by interaction of MDA-MB-231 cells with HUVECs were attenuated when HUVECs were pretreated with an antioxidant, N-acetylcysteine (NAC) or AHCC. AHCC inhibited TEM of MDA-MB-231 cells and generation of ROS induced by interaction of MDA-MB-231 cells with HUVECs.

Expression analysis of the gastrin receptor mRNA was performed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction on PC3 prostate carcinoma cells, U373 glioma, U2OS osteosarcoma and Colo205 colon carcinoma cells. After having confirmed elevated expression of gastrin receptor in PC3 cells and very low expression of the receptor in Colo205 cells, these two cell lines were used to create tumor xenografts on nude mice for in vivo experiments. Confocal lasers scanning microscopy and magnetic resonance imaging showed a high specificity of the correct conjugate for the PC3 xenografts. Staining of the PC3 xenografts was much weaker with the scrambled conjugate while the Colo205 xenografts showed no marked staining with any of the conjugates. In vitro experiments comparing the correct and scrambled conjugates on PC3 cells by magnetic resonance relaxometry and fluorescence-activated cell sorting confirmed markedly higher specificity of the correct conjugate.

Urine is a complex mixture that can be subfractionated. We evaluated 2 urinary fractions that contain nucleic acids, ie cell pellets and exosomes. The influence of digital rectal examination before urine collection was also studied and the prostate cancer specific biomarkers PCA3 and TMPRSS2-ERG were assayed.  Materials and methods:   Urine samples were prospectively obtained before and after digital rectal examination from 30 men scheduled for prostate biopsy. Cell pellet and exosomes were isolated and used for biomarker analysis. Analytical and diagnostic performance was tested using the Student t-test and ROC curves.  Results:   Unlike the exosome fraction, urinary sediment gene expression analysis was compromised by amorphous precipitation in 10% of all specimens. Digital rectal examination resulted in increased mRNA levels in each fraction. This was particularly relevant for the exosomal fraction since after digital rectal examination the number of samples decreased in which cancer specific markers were below the analytical detection limit. Biomarker diagnostic performance was comparable to that in large clinical studies. In exosomes the biomarkers had to be normalized for prostate specific antigen mRNA while cell pellet absolute PCA3 levels had diagnostic value.  Conclusions:   Exosomes have characteristics that enable them to serve as a stable substrate for biomarker analysis. Thus, digital rectal examination enhances the analytical performance of biomarker analysis in exosomes and cell pellets. The diagnostic performance of biomarkers in exosomes differs from that of cell pellets.

Herein, we develop a new homogeneous potentiometric immunoassay for sensitive detection of low-concentration PSA without the need of sample separation and washing step. Two nanostructures including positively charged polyethyleneimine-poly(styrene-co-acrylic acid) (PEI-PSAA) nanospheres and negatively charged gold nanoparticles conjugated with anti-PSA antibody (Ab-AuNP) were first synthesized by using mulsifier-free emulsion copolymerization and wet chemistry method, respectively. Thereafter, the as-prepared PEI-PSAA was used as a pseudo hapten for the construction of immunosensing probe based on an electrostatic interaction between PEI-PSAA and Ab-AuNP. Upon target introduction, the added PSA competed with PEI-PASS for Ab-AuNP based on a specific antigen-antibody interaction, and displaced Ab-AuNP from PEI-PASS. The dissociated PEI-PASS was captured through the negatively charged Nafion- modified electrode, thereby resulting in the change of membrane potential. The fabrication process was characterized by using high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM), scanning electron microscope with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDX), surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and dynamic laser scattering (DLS) technique. Under optimal conditions, the output signal was indirectly proportional to the concentration of target PSA in the sample and exhibited a dynamic range from 0.1 to 50 ng/mL with a detection limit (LOD) of 0.04 ng/mL. Intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation (CVs) were 6.8 and 7.5%, respectively.

Dasatinib inhibits tyrosine kinases, including Src kinases. Data suggests that dasatinib kinase inhibition leads to antitumour activity, affects osteoclasts, and has synergy with docetaxel, a first-line chemotherapy for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. We assessed whether dasatinib plus docetaxel in chemotherapy-naive men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer led to greater efficacy than with docetaxel alone.  Methods:   In this double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled phase 3 study, we enrolled men of 18 years or older with chemotherapy-naive, metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer, and adequate organ function from 186 centres across 25 countries. Eligible patients were randomly assigned (1:1) via an interactive voice response system to receive docetaxel (75 mg/m(2) intravenously every 3 weeks, plus oral prednisone 5 mg twice daily), plus either dasatinib (100 mg orally once daily) or placebo until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Randomisation was stratified by Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (0-1 vs 2), bisphosphonate use (yes vs no), and urinary N-telopeptide (uNTx) value (<60 μmol/mol creatinine vs ≥60 μmol/mol creatinine). All patients, investigators, and personnel involved in study conduct and data analyses were blinded to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was overall survival, analysed by intention to treat. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00744497.  Findings:   Between Oct 30, 2008, and April 11, 2011, 1522 eligible patients were randomly assigned to treatment; 762 patients were assigned to dasatinib and 760 to placebo. At final analysis, median follow-up was 19·0 months (IQR 11·2-25·1) and 914 patients had died. Median overall survival was 21·5 months (95% CI 20·3-22·8) in the dasatinib group and 21·2 months (20·0-23·4) in the placebo group (stratified hazard ratio [HR] 0·99, 95·5% CI 0·87-1·13; p=0·90). The most common grade 3-4 adverse events included diarrhoea (58 [8%] patients in the dasatinib group vs 27 [4%] patients in the placebo group), fatigue (62 [8%] vs 42 [6%]), and asthenia (40 [5%] vs 23 [3%]); grade 3-4 pleural effusions were uncommon (ten [1%] vs three [<1%]).  Interpretation:   The addition of dasatinib to docetaxel did not improve overall survival for chemotherapy-naive men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.

Methods and materials:   From 1998 to 2009, 2937 patients were treated with prostate brachytherapy at the British Columbia Cancer Agency. Baseline patient, treatment, and implant factors were recorded prospectively. Acute urinary toxicity data were prospectively recorded at baseline and each follow-up visit. Patients with ≥2 years of follow-up data were grouped into cohorts of 500 for analysis.  Results:   Two thousand eleven patients met the above criteria. Acute urinary retention (AUR) in the acute period (within 6 months of implant) occurred in 9.1% of patients overall and was prolonged (catheterization >20 days) in 3.4%. Both overall AUR and prolonged AUR decreased across implant cohorts (p ≤ 0.001 in both cases). Overall acute Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) Grades 0 and 1 urinary toxicity rate was 57.5% and RTOG Grades 2 and 3 urinary toxicity rates were 34.3% and 8.1%, respectively. Acute toxicity improved over time for both RTOG Grades ≥2 and ≥3 toxicity (p < 0.0001). International prostate symptom score resolution to baseline was achieved in 80.5% of patients with a median time of 12.2 months.  Conclusions:   Acute AUR and RTOG urinary toxicity rates continue to decline with the increasing experience of our provincial prostate brachytherapy program, despite its expansion to new centers and addition of members.

Objective:   To determine whether cardiovascular morbidity differs following initiation of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists compared with an antagonist.  Design, setting, and participants:   Pooled data from six phase 3 prospective randomized trials that recruited 2328 men between 2005 and 2012 to compare the efficacy of GnRH agonists against an antagonist. Men recruited had pathologically confirmed prostate cancer, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group score <2, a minimum life expectancy of 12 mo, and were naïve to ADT. Men were excluded if they had a prolonged baseline QT/corrected QT interval, other risk factors for heart failure, hypokalemia or a family history of long QT syndrome, or had another cancer diagnosed within 5 yr.  Intervention:   Men were randomized to receive a GnRH agonist or an antagonist for either 3-7 mo (n=642) or 12 mo (n=1686). Treatment groups were balanced for common baseline characteristics.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Event analysis was based on death from any cause or cardiac events. Data documenting adverse experiences were classified based on the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities. The following conditions defined a cardiac event: arterial embolic or thrombotic events, hemorrhagic or ischemic cerebrovascular conditions, myocardial infarction, and other ischemic heart disease. Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank tests were used to compare time to a cardiovascular event or death.  Results and limitations:   Among men with preexisting cardiovascular disease, the risk of cardiac events within 1 yr of initiating therapy was significantly lower among men treated with a GnRH antagonist compared with GnRH agonists (hazard ratio: 0.44; 95% confidence interval, 0.26-0.74; p=0.002). Since our analysis is post hoc, our findings should only be interpreted as hypothesis generating.

Replacing androgens before progression of the disease is hypothesized to prolong androgen dependence.  Methods:   Men with newly diagnosed, metastatic, hormone-sensitive prostate cancer, a performance status of 0 to 2, and a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level of 5 ng per milliliter or higher received a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogue and an antiandrogen agent for 7 months. We then randomly assigned patients in whom the PSA level fell to 4 ng per milliliter or lower to continuous or intermittent androgen deprivation, with patients stratified according to prior or no prior hormonal therapy, performance status, and extent of disease (minimal or extensive). The coprimary objectives were to assess whether intermittent therapy was noninferior to continuous therapy with respect to survival, with a one-sided test with an upper boundary of the hazard ratio of 1.20, and whether quality of life differed between the groups 3 months after randomization.  Results:   A total of 3040 patients were enrolled, of whom 1535 were included in the analysis: 765 randomly assigned to continuous androgen deprivation and 770 assigned to intermittent androgen deprivation. The median follow-up period was 9.8 years. Median survival was 5.8 years in the continuous-therapy group and 5.1 years in the intermittent-therapy group (hazard ratio for death with intermittent therapy, 1.10; 90% confidence interval, 0.99 to 1.23). Intermittent therapy was associated with better erectile function and mental health (P<0.001 and P = 0.003, respectively) at month 3 but not thereafter. There were no significant differences between the groups in the number of treatment-related high-grade adverse events.  Conclusions:   Our findings were statistically inconclusive. In patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer, the confidence interval for survival exceeded the upper boundary for noninferiority, suggesting that we cannot rule out a 20% greater risk of death with intermittent therapy than with continuous therapy, but too few events occurred to rule out significant inferiority of intermittent therapy.

Over a median follow-up period of 22.2 months, overall survival was improved with abiraterone-prednisone (median not reached, vs. 27.2 months for prednisone alone; hazard ratio, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.61 to 0.93; P = 0.01) but did not cross the efficacy boundary. Abiraterone-prednisone showed superiority over prednisone alone with respect to time to initiation of cytotoxic chemotherapy, opiate use for cancer-related pain, prostate-specific antigen progression, and decline in performance status. Grade 3 or 4 mineralocorticoid-related adverse events and abnormalities on liver-function testing were more common with abiraterone-prednisone.  Conclusions:   Abiraterone improved radiographic progression-free survival, showed a trend toward improved overall survival, and significantly delayed clinical decline and initiation of chemotherapy in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.""","""['Donald L Trump']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Abiraterone in metastatic prostate cancer without previous chemotherapy.', 'Abiraterone in metastatic prostate cancer without previous chemotherapy.', 'Abiraterone acetate plus prednisone versus placebo plus prednisone in chemotherapy-naive men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (COU-AA-302): final overall survival analysis of a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 study.', 'Abiraterone acetate for treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: final overall survival analysis of the COU-AA-301 randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 study.', 'Abiraterone acetate: a review of its use in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Abiraterone in the management of castration-resistant prostate cancer prior to chemotherapy.', 'Prospective Multicenter Study of Circulating Tumor Cell AR-V7 and Taxane Versus Hormonal Treatment Outcomes in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Pharmacological cancer treatment and venous thromboembolism risk.', 'Methylation of SRD5A2 promoter predicts a better outcome for castration-resistant prostate cancer patients undergoing androgen deprivation therapy.', 'Bone scan positivity in non-metastatic, castrate-resistant prostate cancer: external validation study.', 'The Potential for Chemotherapy-Free Strategies in Advanced Prostate Cancer.']"""

We investigated the effects of the addition of docetaxel to androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) for patients with metastatic non-castrate prostate cancer.  Methods:   In this randomised, open-label, phase 3 study, we enrolled patients in 29 centres in France and one in Belgium. Eligible patients were older than 18 years and had histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate and radiologically proven metastatic disease; a Karnofsky score of at least 70%; a life expectancy of at least 3 months; and adequate hepatic, haematological, and renal function. They were randomly assigned to receive to ADT (orchiectomy or luteinising hormone-releasing hormone agonists, alone or combined with non-steroidal antiandrogens) alone or in combination with docetaxel (75 mg/m(2) intravenously on the first day of each 21-day cycle; up to nine cycles). Patients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio, with dynamic minimisation to minimise imbalances in previous systemic treatment with ADT, chemotherapy for local disease or isolated rising concentration of serum prostate-specific antigen, and Glass risk groups. Patients, physicians, and data analysts were not masked to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was overall survival. Efficacy analyses were done by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00104715.  Findings:   Between Oct 18, 2004, and Dec 31, 2008, 192 patients were randomly allocated to receive ADT plus docetaxel and 193 to receive ADT alone. Median follow-up was 50 months (IQR 39-63). Median overall survival was 58 9 months (95% CI 50 8-69 1) in the group given ADT plus docetaxel and 54 2 months (42 2-not reached) in that given ADT alone (hazard ratio 1 01, 95% CI 0 75-1 36). 72 serious adverse events were reported in the group given ADT plus docetaxel, of which the most frequent were neutropenia (40 [21%]), febrile neutropenia (six [3%]), abnormal liver function tests (three [2%]), and neutropenia with infection (two [1%]). Four treatment-related deaths occurred in the ADT plus docetaxel group (two of which were neutropenia-related), after which the data monitoring committee recommended treatment with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. After this recommendation, no further treatment-related deaths occurred. No serious adverse events were reported in the ADT alone group.  Interpretation:   Docetaxel should not be used as part of first-line treatment for patients with non-castrate metastatic prostate cancer.""","""['Donald L Trump']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Androgen-deprivation therapy alone or with docetaxel in non-castrate metastatic prostate cancer (GETUG-AFU 15): a randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial.', 'Androgen-deprivation therapy alone or with docetaxel in non-castrate metastatic prostate cancer (GETUG-AFU 15): a randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial.', 'Androgen deprivation therapy plus docetaxel and estramustine versus androgen deprivation therapy alone for high-risk localised prostate cancer (GETUG 12): a phase 3 randomised controlled trial.', 'Aflibercept versus placebo in combination with docetaxel and prednisone for treatment of men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (VENICE): a phase 3, double-blind randomised trial.', 'Should docetaxel be standard of care for patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer?

Surprisingly, it was also found that DPS protects normal intestinal crypt epithelial cells (CECs) from clonogenic death after ionizing radiation (IR). Here we tested the DPS radiosensitizing effect in a clinically relevant model of prostate cancer and explored the radioprotective effect and mechanism of DPS on CECs.  Methods and materials:   The radiation modification effect of DPS was tested in a mouse model of orthotopic xenograft prostate cancer and of IR-induced acute gastrointestinal syndrome. The effect of DPS on CEC DNA damage and DNA damage responses was determined by immunohistochemistry.  Results:   In the mouse model of IR-induced gastrointestinal syndrome, DPS treatment before IR accelerated recovery from body weight loss and increased animal survival. DPS decreased post-IR DNA damage and cell death, suggesting that the radioprotective effect was mediated by enhanced DNA damage repair. Shortly after DPS injection, significant cell cycle arrest was observed in CECs at both G1/S and G2/M checkpoints, which was accompanied by the activation of cell cycle inhibitors p21 and growth arrest and DNA-damage-inducible protein 45 alpha (GADD45A). Further investigation revealed that DPS activated ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), an important inducer of DNA damage repair and cell cycle arrest.  Conclusions:   DPS selectively radioprotected normal intestinal CECs and sensitized prostate cancer cells in a clinically relevant model. This effect may be, at least in part, mediated by DNA damage response activation and has the potential to significantly increase the therapeutic index of radiation therapy.""","""['Junqiang Tian', 'Hiroshi Doi', 'Matthias Saar', 'Jennifer Santos', 'Xuejun Li', 'Donna M Peehl', 'Susan J Knox']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""[""Curcumin enhances the response of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma cells to ionizing radiation through further induction of cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase and inhibition of mTOR phosphorylation."", 'Darinaparsin: solid tumor hypoxic cytotoxin and radiosensitizer.', 'Radioprotection by hymenialdisine-derived checkpoint kinase 2 inhibitors.', 'Cell cycle regulation after exposure to ionizing radiation.', 'Radioprotection: the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and prostaglandins.', 'Cytotoxic Effects of Darinaparsin, a Novel Organic Arsenical, against Human Leukemia Cells.', 'Extracellular matrix stiffness mediates radiosensitivity in a 3D nasopharyngeal carcinoma model.', 'Pravastatin reduces radiation-induced damage in normal tissues.', 'Turning on the Radio: Epigenetic Inhibitors as Potential Radiopriming Agents.', '4EGI-1 induces apoptosis and enhances radiotherapy sensitivity in nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells via DR5 induction on 4E-BP1 dephosphorylation.']"""

Methods:   We did a retrospective cohort study of our institution's registry of patients undergoing either IMRT or RP between January 1999 and March 2010, and assessed Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA), age at diagnosis, Gleason score, and digital rectal examination. Two groups were separated according to RP or IMRT treatment and these groups were in turn divided into risk groups according to the D'Amico classification. Overall survival (OS), cause-specific survival (CSS), mortality from other causes (MOC), and biochemical disease-free survival (BDFS) were assessed.  Results:   Twelve-hundred patients were included: 993 in the RP group and 207 in the IMRT group.The IMRT group had older age, PSA at diagnosis and a significantly higher percentage of cancer on the needle biopsy (p <0.001). Of the 207 patients who underwent IMRT, 54% presented comorbidities. Median follow-up was 91.7 months for the RP group and 76 months for the IMRT group. The OS at 5 and 7 was 96.2, and 93.7 for the RP group respectively and 88.4, and 83.1 for the IMRT group respectively (p <0.001). There were no significant differences in the CSS in relation to treatment received among the low- and high-risk groups, while in the intermediate-risk group, patients who underwent to RP had a higher CSS than patients who underwent IMRT (99.6% vs 94.1%, p=0.003). The IMRT group had a significantly better BDFS than the RP group (86.4% vs. 74.3%, respectively, p=0.016).

Objective:   To determine the proportion of men with localised PCa who are potentially suitable for focal therapy.  Design, setting, and participants:   Our institutional transperineal template prostate-mapping (TTPM) biopsy registry of 377 men from 2006 to 2010 identified 291 consecutive men with no prior treatment.  Intervention:   TTPM biopsies using a 5-mm sampling frame.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Suitability for focal therapy required the cancer to be (1) unifocal, (2) unilateral, (3) bilateral/bifocal with at least one neurovascular bundle avoided, or (4) bilateral/multifocal with one dominant index lesion and secondary lesions with Gleason ≤3 + 3 and cancer core involvement ≤3 mm. Binary logistic regression modelling was used to determine variables predictive for focal therapy suitability.  Results and limitations:   The median age was 61 yr, and the median prostate-specific antigen was 6.8 ng/ml. The median total was 29 cores, with a median of 8 positive cores. Of 239 of 291 men with cancer, 29% (70 men), 60% (144 men), and 8% (20 men) had low-, intermediate-, and high-risk PCa, respectively. Ninety-two percent (220 men) were suitable for one form of focal therapy: hemiablation (22%, 53 men), unifocal ablation (31%, 73 men), bilateral/bifocal ablation (14%, 33 men), and index lesion ablation (26%, 61 men). Binary logistic regression modelling incorporating transrectal biopsy parameters showed no statistically significant predictive variable. When incorporating TTPM parameters, only T stage was a significant negative predictor for suitability (p=0.001) (odds ratio: 0.001 [95% confidence interval, 0.000-0.048]). Limitations of the study include potential selection bias caused by tertiary referral practise and lack of long-term results on focal therapy efficacy.

The large interfractional deformations of the clinical target volume (CTV) still require introduction of safety margins which leads to undesirably high rectum toxicity. Here we present further results from the 2-Step IMRT method which generates adaptable prostate IMRT plans using Beam Eye View (BEV) and 3D information.  Methods:   Intermediate/high-risk prostate carcinoma cases are treated using Simultaneous Integrated Boost at the Universitätsklinkum Würzburg (UKW). Based on the planning CT a CTV is defined as the prostate and the base of seminal vesicles. The CTV is expanded by 10 mm resulting in the PTV; the posterior margin is limited to 7 mm. The Boost is obtained by expanding the CTV by 5 mm, overlap with rectum is not allowed. Prescription doses to PTV and Boost are 60.1 and 74 Gy respectively given in 33 fractions.We analyse the geometry of the structures of interest (SOIs): PTV, Boost, and rectum, and generate 2-Step IMRT plans to deliver three fluence steps: conformal to the target SOIs (S0), sparing the rectum (S1), and narrow segments compensating the underdosage in the target SOIs due to the rectum sparing (S2). The width of S2 segments is calculated for every MLC leaf pair based on the target and rectum geometry in the corresponding CT layer to have best target coverage. The resulting segments are then fed into the DMPO optimizer of the Pinnacle treatment planning system for weight optimization and fine-tuning of the form, prior to final dose calculation using the collapsed cone algorithm.We adapt 2-Step IMRT plans to changed geometry whilst simultaneously preserving the number of initially planned Monitor Units (MU). The adaptation adds three further steps to the previous isocenter relocation: 1) 2-Step generation for the geometry of the day using the relocated isocenter, MU transfer from the planning geometry; 2) Adaptation of the widths of S2 segments to the geometry of the day; 3) Imitation of DMPO fine-tuning for the geometry of the day.  Results and conclusion:   We have performed automated 2-Step IMRT adaptation for ten prostate adaptation cases. The adapted plans show statistically significant improvement of the target coverage and of the rectum sparing compared to those plans in which only the isocenter is relocated. The 2-Step IMRT method may become a core of the automated adaptive radiation therapy system at our department.""","""['Kostyantyn Holubyev', 'Klaus Bratengeier', 'Mark Gainey', 'Bülent Polat', 'Michael Flentje']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Radiat Oncol""","""['Probabilistic dose distribution from interfractional motion in carbon ion radiation therapy for prostate cancer shows rectum sparing with moderate target coverage degradation.', 'Radiotherapy treatment plans with RapidArc for prostate cancer involving seminal vesicles and lymph nodes.', 'Prostate and seminal vesicle volume based consideration of prostate cancer patients for treatment with 3D-conformal or intensity-modulated radiation therapy.', 'Dosimetric adaptive IMRT driven by fiducial points.', 'Evaluation of the dosimetric impact of non-exclusion of the rectum from the boost PTV in IMRT treatment plans for prostate cancer patients.']"""

Androgen receptor (AR) expression may represent a potential marker of prognosis in prostate cancer. However, there have been variable results regarding its ability to predict clinical progression. Despite the oncogenic properties of DJ-1, its significance in prostate cancer development and progression is not well understood. This research shed some light on the possible role of immunohistochemical expression of DJ-1 in clinically localized prostatic carcinoma in relation to the established role of AR and other clinicopathologic parameters.  Materials and methods:   The immunohistochemical expression of AR and DJ-1 was evaluated in 129 samples including benign hyperplasia (n = 60) and prostatic carcinoma (n = 69).  Results:   The mean value of AR immunostaining was significantly higher in prostatic carcinomas than in benign hyperplasia (P = 0.001). A significant inverse correlation was found between AR immunostaining and the grade of prostatic carcinomas. A significantly higher median DJ-1 score was found in prostatic carcinoma than in benign hyperplasia (P = 0.0001). There was a significant direct correlation between AR and DJ-1 score (P = 0.0001). AR is more sensitive in predicting prostatic carcinoma than DJ-1 but DJ-1 is more specific than AR.  Conclusion:   AR nuclear expression was consistently present in benign and adenocarcinoma epithelium. But, there may be limited clinical use for AR expression in localized carcinoma due to its constant heterogeneity. DJ-1 with its oncogenic properties, specificity for prostatic carcinoma and homogenous expression gives an ideal complementary role to AR in the detection and treatment of prostatic carcinomas.""","""['Wesam M Osman', 'Rasha M Abd El Atti', 'Hoda H Abou Gabal']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Egypt Natl Canc Inst""","""['DJ-1 binds androgen receptor directly and mediates its activity in hormonally treated prostate cancer cells.', 'Role of androgen receptor in prostatic neoplasia versus hyperplasia.', 'Androgen receptor versus erbB-1 and erbB-2 expression in human prostate neoplasms.', 'Stromal androgen receptor roles in the development of normal prostate, benign prostate hyperplasia, and prostate cancer.', 'The role of the androgen receptor in the development of prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer.', 'Silencing of DJ-1 reduces proliferation, invasion, and migration of papillary thyroid cancer cells in vitro, probably by increase of PTEN expression.', 'Preoperative serum 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine is associated with chemoresistance and is a powerful prognostic factor in endometrioid-type epithelial ovarian cancer.']"""

The aim of this analysis was to evaluate the management of CRPC patients across five European countries (France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK).  Methods:   Data were drawn from the Adelphi Real World Prostate Cancer Disease Specific Programme (DSP), a cross-sectional survey of patients undertaken between December 2009 and May 2010. The study is based on physician interviews, physician-completed detailed patient record forms, and a patient-completed questionnaire.  Results:   A total of 348 physicians (191 urologists and 157 oncologists) reported on 3477 patients with prostate cancer. Of the 3477 patients, 1405 (40%) were categorised as having CRPC, and 1119 of these had metastatic CRPC. Bone metastases were the most common (78%), followed by liver (37%) and lung (30%). The mean age of CRPC patients was 71 years, 35% were current or ex-smokers and 10% had a family history of prostate cancer. CRPC patients had a mean of 1.8 comorbidities; 66% had hypertension and 32% had diabetes. Most physicians estimated their patients would stop responding to initial hormone therapy after 19-24 months. Overall, addition of an anti-androgen to a luteinising-hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist was the most commonly prescribed therapy when patients failed initial LHRH agonist therapy, although there were considerable variations between countries. While 72% of physicians in Europe would choose chemotherapy as the next treatment option after diagnosis of CRPC, 31% of this group would initially prescribe this without an LHRH agonist.

This is likely due to a high level of suppression at the tumor site from a variety of sources, including immunosuppressive cells. Immune cells entering the tumor microenvironment may be inhibited directly by the tumor, stromal cells or other immune cells that have been induced to adopt a suppressive phenotype. The resurgence of interest in immunotherapy following the approval of sipuleucel-T and ipilimumab by the Food and Drug Administration has brought about new strategies for overcoming tumor-mediated suppression and bolstering anti-tumor responses.

Overall, ATIP1 and ATIP3 mRNA expression was increased in malignant compared to normal tissues and cell lines. ATIP immunostaining was low or absent in both the basal and columnar epithelial cell layers surrounding BPH acini; however, it was observed in high concentration in neoplastic epithelial cells of HGPIN and was clearly evident in cytoplasms of malignant cells in all prostate cancer grades. ATIP immunostaining was also identified in the cytoplasms of LNCaP and PC3 prostate cancer cells.

However, it is crucial to have an accurate training data set for supervised classification techniques. Since different devices with, e.g., different protocols and/or field strengths cause different intensity profiles, each device/protocol must have an accompanying training data set, which is very costly to obtain. It is highly desirable to adapt the existing classifier(s) trained for one device/protocol to help classify data coming from another device/protocol. In this paper, we propose a novel method that has the ability to design classifiers obtained from one imaging protocol and/or MRI device to be used on a data set from another protocol and/or imaging device. As an example problem, we consider prostate cancer localization with multiparametric MRI. We show that simple normalization techniques such as z-score are not sufficient for cross-device automated cancer localization. On the other hand, the method we have originally developed based on relative intensity allows us to successfully use a classifier obtained from one device to be applied on a test patient imaged with another device. Proposed method also allows us to employ T2-weighted MR images directly instead of an additional step to normalize T2-weighted images usually performed in an ad hoc manner when T2 maps are not available. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we use a multiparametric MRI data set acquired from 18 biopsy-confirmed cancer patients with two separate scanners: 1) 1.5-T (Excite HD) GE and 2) 1.5-T (Achieva) Philips Healthcare scanners. A comprehensive visual, quantitative, and statistical analysis of the results show that methods we have developed allow us to: 1) perform cross-device automated classification and 2) use T2-weighted images without an ad hoc subject-specific normalization.""","""['Yusuf Artan', 'Aytekin Oto', 'Imam Samil Yetik']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""IEEE Trans Image Process""","""['Cross-device automated prostate cancer localization with multiparametric MRI.', 'Prostate cancer localization using multiparametric MRI based on semi-supervised techniques with automated seed initialization.', 'Automated prostate cancer localization without the need for peripheral zone extraction using multiparametric MRI.', 'Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging in the detection of prostate cancer.', 'Prostate cancer: multiparametric MR imaging for detection, localization, and staging.', 'A Multi-Center, Multi-Vendor Study to Evaluate the Generalizability of a Radiomics Model for Classifying Prostate cancer: High Grade vs. Low Grade.', 'Comparing radiomic classifiers and classifier ensembles for detection of peripheral zone prostate tumors on T2-weighted MRI: a multi-site study.', 'Imaging modalities in focal therapy: patient selection, treatment guidance, and follow-up.']"""

Unfortunately, after a few years, the majority of patients progress, developing androgen-independent PCa. AR-driven gene transcription recruits a large number of co-activator/co-repressor complexes; among these, the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNP K) directly interacts with and regulates the AR translational apparatus. Here we examined AR and hnRNP K expression in response to the treatment of LNCaP cells with anti-androgen cyproterone acetate (CPA) or bicalutamide (BIC). AR and hnRNP K modulation and compartmentalization were studied by Western blot and confocal microscopy. Phosphate-affinity gel electrophoresis was employed to examine how anti-androgens modified hnRNP K phosphorylation. 10(-6) M CPA significantly stimulated LNCaP proliferation, whereas for 10(-4) M CPA or 10(-5) M BIC an antagonistic effect was observed. After anti-androgen treatment, AR expression was remarkably down-regulated within both the cytoplasm and the nucleus; however, when CPA had an agonist activity, the AR associated with the nuclear matrix (NM) increased approximately 2.5 times. This increase was synchronous with a higher PSA expression, indicating that the NM-associated AR represents the active complex. After BIC treatment, hnRNP K expression was significantly lower in the NM, the protein was hypophosphorylated and the co-localization of AR and hnRNP K decreased. In contrast, CPA as an agonist caused hnRNP K hyperphosphorylation and an increase in the co-localization of two proteins. These findings demonstrate that, in vitro, there is a strong relationship between NM-associated AR and both cell viability and PSA levels, indicating that AR transcriptional activity is critically dependent on its subnuclear localization. Moreover, the agonistic/antagonistic activity of anti-androgens is associated with modifications in hnRNP K phosphorylation, indicating an involvement of this protein in the AR transcriptional activity and likely in the onset of the androgen-independent phenotype.""","""['Paola Barboro', 'Luana Borzì', 'Erica Repaci', 'Nicoletta Ferrari', 'Cecilia Balbi']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['A hnRNP K⁻AR-Related Signature Reflects Progression toward Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Prostate cancer: prognostic significance of the association of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K and androgen receptor expression.', 'Androgen receptor and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K colocalize in the nucleoplasm and are modulated by bicalutamide and 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen in prostatic cancer cell lines.', 'Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K is a novel regulator of androgen receptor translation.', 'Inhibition of MAPK-signaling pathway promotes the interaction of the corepressor SMRT with the human androgen receptor and mediates repression of prostate cancer cell growth in the presence of antiandrogens.', 'PIM1 phosphorylation of the androgen receptor and 14-3-3 ζ regulates gene transcription in prostate cancer.', 'Multifocal Signal Modulation Therapy by Celecoxib: A Strategy for Managing Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'A hnRNP K⁻AR-Related Signature Reflects Progression toward Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Adaptive phenotype drives resistance to androgen deprivation therapy in prostate cancer.', 'Identification of simvastatin-regulated targets associated with JNK activation in DU145 human prostate cancer cell death signaling.']"""

Further analysis showed that these two proteins are connected in another way, with 280B up-regulation of sGCα1 expression. Knock-down and over-expression experiments showed that 280B serves pro-growth and pro-survival functions in prostate cancer. Surprisingly however, these pro-cancer functions of 280B are not mediated by sGCα1, which itself has similar functions in prostate cancer, but by down-regulated p53. The p53 protein is a second target of 280B in prostate cancer, but unlike sGCα1, p53 is down-regulated by 280B. 280B induces p53 nuclear export, leading to subsequent proteasomal degradation. The protein responsible for p53 regulation by 280B is Mdm2, the E3 ubiquitin ligase that promotes p53 degradation by inducing its nuclear export. We show here that 280B up-regulates expression of Mdm2 in prostate cancer cells, and this regulation is via the Mdm2 promoter. To demonstrate an in vivo relevance to this interaction, expression studies show that 280B protein levels are up-regulated in prostate cancer and these levels correspond to reduced levels of p53. Thus, by enhancing the expression of Mdm2, the uncharacterized 280B protein provides a novel mechanism of p53 suppression in prostate cancer.""","""['Shuai Gao', 'Chen-Lin Hsieh', 'Jun Zhou', 'Lirim Shemshedini']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Soluble guanylyl cyclase α1 and p53 cytoplasmic sequestration and down-regulation in prostate cancer.', 'COP9 subunits 4 and 5 target soluble guanylyl cyclase α1 and p53 in prostate cancer cells.', 'Androgen regulation of soluble guanylyl cyclasealpha1 mediates prostate cancer cell proliferation.', 'The regulation of MDM2 oncogene and its impact on human cancers.', 'Regulation of p53: a collaboration between Mdm2 and Mdmx.', 'Potential miRNA-gene interactions determining progression of various ATLL cancer subtypes after infection by HTLV-1 oncovirus.', 'Zinc finger protein 280C contributes to colorectal tumorigenesis by maintaining epigenetic repression at H3K27me3-marked loci.', 'ZNF280B promotes the growth of gastric cancer in vitro and in vivo.', 'Clearance of a persistent picornavirus infection is associated with enhanced pro-apoptotic and cellular immune responses.', 'Adult high-grade B-cell lymphoma with Burkitt lymphoma signature: genomic features and potential therapeutic targets.']"""

Methods:   CT-NLC were developed to improve the hydrophilicity of tripterine. The antiproliferative effects of CT-NLC, tripterine-loaded nanostructured lipid carriers (T-NLC), and free tripterine in a human prostatic carcinoma cell line (PC-3) and a mouse prostate carcinoma cell line (RM-1) were evaluated using an MTT assay. The advantage of CT-NLC over T-NLC and free tripterine with regard to antitumor activity in vivo was evaluated in a prostate tumor-bearing mouse model. The induced tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6 cytokine content was investigated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to determine the effect of CT-NLC, T-NLC, and free tripterine on immune responses. Histologic and TUNEL assays were carried out to investigate the mechanisms of tumor necrosis and apoptosis.  Results:   CT-NLC, T-NLC, and free tripterine showed high antiproliferative activity in a dose-dependent manner, with an IC50 of 0.60, 0.81, and 1.02 μg/mL in the PC-3 cell line and 0.41, 0.54, and 0.89 μg/mL in the RM-1 cell line after 36 hours. In vivo, the tumor inhibition rates for cyclophosphamide, high-dose (4 mg/kg) and low-dose (2 mg/kg) tripterine, high-dose (4 mg/kg) and low-dose (2 mg/kg) T-NLC, high-dose (4 mg/kg) and low-dose (2 mg/kg) CT-NLC were 76.51%, 37.07%, 29.53%, 63.56%, 48.25%, 72.68%, and 54.50%, respectively, showing a dose-dependent pattern. The induced tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6 cytokine content after treatment with CT-NLC and T-NLC was significantly higher than that of high-dose tripterine. Moreover, CT-NLC showed the expected advantage of inducing necrosis and apoptosis in prostate tumor cells.  Conclusion:   CT-NLC noticeably enhanced antitumor activity in vitro and in vivo and showed dramatically improved cytotoxicity in normal cells in comparison with free tripterine.

Luminescent signals of human prostate cancer cells (CWR22R and LNCaP) labeled with NaYF4: Yb, Er nanoparticles were detected by laser scanning confocal microscope, while Cy3 or FITC was used as control probe. Mouse-human prostate cancer model was developed by subcutaneously injecting the CWR22R cells into BALB/c nude mice to investigate the in-vivo imaging properties of NaYF4:Yb, Er nanoparticles. Both CWR22R and LNCaP cells could phagocytose NaYF4:Yb, Er nanoparticles in vitro, and the cellular uptake of CWR22R cells was much higher than that of LNCaP cells (95.42 ± 3.47 % vs. 51.63 ± 6.43 %), which made us choose the former for the further study. CWR22R cells pre-labeled with NaYF4:Yb, Er nanoparticles showed no obvious decrease of fluorescence intensity (P > 0.05) after light exposure, while the fluorescence intensity of Cy3 or FITC labeled cells decreased rapidly with prolonged bleaching (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the in-vivo results showed that the prostate cancer cells pre-labeled with or without NaYF4:Yb, Er nanoparticles formed tumors 4 weeks after injection, and the tumor length-diameter of the nanoparticle group and the control group was (10.3 ± 2.0) mm and (9.8 ± 2.5) mm, respectively. Significant upconversion fluorescence signals were observed in the tumors of the nanoparticle group when being excited at 980 nm by a NIR laser.

NBIF inhibits the proliferation of prostate cancer in vitro and in vivo.  Main methods:   Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is a key endogenous molecule that selectively induces apoptosis in cancer cells with little or no toxicity in normal cells. However, some cancer cells, including U373MG cells, are resistant to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. We demonstrated that the cell viability, migration and invasion assay were used in U373MG glioma cells.  Key findings:   In this study, we found that NBIF sensitizes human U373MG glioma cells to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. Co-treatment of TRAIL and NBIF effectively induced Bid cleavage and activated caspases 3, 8, and 9. Importantly, DR5 expression was upregulated by NBIF. We also observed that the combination NBIF and TRAIL increased expression of BAX. We further demonstrate that NBIF induced TRAIL-mediated apoptosis in human glioma cells by suppressing migration and invasion, and by inhibiting anoikis resistance.

Glioma can be a highly malignant brain tumor and has few known risk factors. Genetic variants in or near RTEL1 and TERT, key components of telomere biology, are associated with glioma risk. Therefore, we evaluated the association between relative telomere length (RTL) and glioma in a prospective study.  Materials and methods:   We performed a nested case-control study within the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial. RTL was determined by quantitative PCR on blood or buccal cell DNA obtained at least 2 years prior to diagnosis from 101 individuals with glioma cases. Healthy controls (n=198) were matched to cases (2:1) on age, gender, smoking status, calendar year, and DNA source. Conditional logistic regression was used to investigate the association between RTL and glioma.  Results:   As expected, RTL declined with increasing age in both cases and controls. There was no statistically significant association between RTL and glioma overall. An analysis stratified by gender suggested that short RTL (1st tertile) in males was associated with glioma (odds ratio, [OR]=2.29, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02-5.11); this association was not observed for females (OR=0.41, 95% CI 0.14-1.17).

Accounting explicitly for rectal motion could improve the predictive power of modelling rectal morbidity. To test this, we simulated the effect of motion in two cohorts.  Materials and methods:   The included patients (232 and 159 cases) received RT for prostate cancer to 70 and 74 Gy. Motion-inclusive dose distributions were introduced as simulations of random or systematic motion to the planned dose distributions. Six rectal morbidity endpoints were analysed. A probit model using the QUANTEC recommended parameters was also applied to the cohorts.  Results:   The differences in associations using the planned over the motion-inclusive dose distributions were modest. Statistically significant associations were obtained with four of the endpoints, mainly at high doses (55-70 Gy), using both the planned and the motion-inclusive dose distributions, primarily when simulating random motion. The strongest associations were observed for GI toxicity and rectal bleeding (Rs=0.12-0.21; Rs=0.11-0.20). Applying the probit model, significant associations were found for tenesmus and rectal bleeding (Rs=0.13, p=0.02).  Conclusion:   Equally strong associations with rectal morbidity were observed at high doses (>55 Gy), for the planned and the simulated dose distributions including in particular random rectal motion.

Most recently, we have shown that URI/RMP is up-regulated in cervical cancer, another reproductive system tumor beside ovarian and prostate cancers. To investigate if URI/RMP also plays a role in other reproductive system tumors, especially in endometrioid adenocarcinoma, we analyzed URI/RMP expression in a TMA (tissue microarray) containing tissues from 30 cases of endometrioid adenocarcinoma (which covers tumor tissues from Grade I through Grade III) and adjacent endometrium by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and densitometry analysis using image-pro plus 6.0 software. Our results showed that the mean density of URI/RMP expression in cancerous tissue is slightly higher than that of the adjacent endometrial tissue, though not statistically significant (p>0.05). There is no significant difference either between the mean density of Grade III cancerous tissue and that of Grade I and II cancers. Notably, we detected significantly higher signal intensity in cancerous tissue of all 7 Grade III cases than that of their adjacent endometrial tissue (p<0.05), suggesting a correlation of URI/RMP expression with the differentiation and pathological classification of endometrioid adenocarcinoma. Together, our results demonstrate the heterogeneous expression of URI/RMP in endometrioid adenocarcinoma.

The MAPK Signaling Pathway plays an important role in multiple tumors, including prostate carcinoma. MAPK signaling is mediated by ERK1/2, JNK and p38 MAPK, which are important in the control of cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. However, relatively little is known about the regulatory mechanism of p38 MAPK in prostate cancers. NOB1 is among the most novel topic in MAPK studies currently. Recent studies found its vital role in tumor metastasis in glioblastoma proliferation, however, its expression profile and its prognostic value in prostate carcinoma have not been investigated.  Methods:   To determine the relationship between NOB1 and p38 MAPK expressions, a population-based study was conducted for immunohistochemical staining analysis of tumor tissues, in matched malignant and nonmalignant prostatectomy samples from 132 PCa patients. Moreover, Western blot analysis and NOB1 interference studies of prostate cancer cell lines. To evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic between NOB1 and p38 MAPK in prostate cancer (PCa) tissue after radical prostatectomy, the hypothesis that prostate cancers with NOB1 expression have distinct clinical, prognostic and molecular attributes was tested.  Results:   Among 132 prostate cancers, NOB1 expression was detected in 117 (88.7%) tumors by immunohistochemistry. NOB1 and p38 MAPK expression had significant positive correlation with carcinogenesis, tumor progression and patient survival. Immunohistochemically, NOB1 expression in prostate cancer was independently associated with p38 MAPK activation (P=0.0002). Furthermore, p38 MAPK expression was completely suppressed by NOB1 interference in the prostate cancer cell lines DU-145 and PC-3.  Conclusions:   NOB1 expression status was closely correlated with important histopathologic characteristics and the recurrence and metastasis of prostate carcinomas. These data support a potential link between NOB1 and p38 MAPK, and suggest that NOB1 may identify a subset of prostate cancer patients with a poor prognosis. This study proved that NOB1 in PCa tissue can be used, in combination with traditional clinicopathological factors, as promising diagnostic and prognostic tools.""","""['Jian-Ping Che', 'Wei Li', 'Yang Yan', 'Min Liu', 'Guang-Chun Wang', 'Qian-Yu Li', 'Bin Yang', 'Xu-Dong Yao', 'Jun-Hua Zheng']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Int J Clin Exp Pathol""","""['Nin one binding protein expression as a prognostic marker in prostate carcinoma.', 'Positive nin one binding protein expression predicts poor outcome in prostate cancer.', 'Downregulated miR-646 in clear cell renal carcinoma correlated with tumour metastasis by targeting the nin one binding protein (NOB1).', 'NOB1: A Potential Biomarker or Target in Cancer.', 'Prostate cancer dormancy and recurrence.', 'Exosomal prostate-specific G-protein-coupled receptor induces osteoblast activity to promote the osteoblastic metastasis of prostate cancer.', 'MicroRNA-363-3p downregulation in papillary thyroid cancer inhibits tumor progression by targeting NOB1.', 'Fucoidan Extracted from Undaria pinnatifida: Source for Nutraceuticals/Functional Foods.', 'Integrin α2β1 decelerates proliferation, but promotes survival and invasion of prostate cancer cells.', 'Screening of differentially expressed genes in male idiopathic osteoporosis via RNA sequencing.']"""

Objective:   To examine the association of market-level technological capacity with receipt of local therapy.  Design:   Retrospective cohort.  Subjects:   Patients with localized prostate cancer who were diagnosed between 2003 and 2007 (n=59,043) from the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results-Medicare database.  Measures:   We measured the capacity for delivering treatment with new technology as the number of providers offering robotic prostatectomy or IMRT per population in a market (hospital referral region). The association of this measure with receipt of prostatectomy, radiotherapy, or observation was examined with multinomial logistic regression.  Results:   For each 1000 patients diagnosed with prostate cancer, 174 underwent prostatectomy, 490 radiotherapy, and 336 were observed. Markets with high robotic prostatectomy capacity had higher use of prostatectomy (146 vs. 118 per 1000 men, P=0.008) but a trend toward decreased use of radiotherapy (574 vs. 601 per 1000 men, P=0.068), resulting in a stable rate of local therapy. High versus low IMRT capacity did not significantly impact the use of prostatectomy (129 vs. 129 per 1000 men, P=0.947) and radiotherapy (594 vs. 585 per 1000 men, P=0.579).  Conclusions:   Although there was a small shift from radiotherapy to prostatectomy in markets with high robotic prostatectomy capacity, increased capacity for both robotic prostatectomy and IMRT did not change the overall rate of local therapy.

Angiogenesis is required for metastasis. Bradykinin (BK) is an inflammatory mediator involved in tumor growth and metastasis, but its role in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression and angiogenesis in human prostate cancer remains unknown. The aim of this study was to examine whether BK promotes prostate cancer angiogenesis via VEGF expression. We found that exogenous BK increased VEGF expression in prostate cancer cells and further promoted tube formation in endothelial progenitor cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Pretreatment of prostate cancer with B2 receptor antagonist or small interfering RNA (siRNA) reduced BK-mediated VEGF production. The Akt and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathways were activated after BK treatment, and BK-induced VEGF expression was abolished by the specific inhibitor and siRNA of the Akt and mTOR cascades. BK also promoted nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and activator protein 1 (AP-1) activity. Importantly, BK knockdown reduced VEGF expression and abolished prostate cancer cell conditional medium-mediated angiogenesis. Taken together, these results indicate that BK operates through the B2 receptor, Akt, and mTOR, which in turn activate NF-κB and AP-1, activating VEGF expression and contributing to angiogenesis in human prostate cancer cells.""","""['Hsin-Shan Yu', 'Shih-Wei Wang', 'An-Chen Chang', 'Huai-Ching Tai', 'Hung-I Yeh', 'Yu-Min Lin', 'Chih-Hsin Tang']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Biochem Pharmacol""","""['Overexpression of Id-1 in prostate cancer cells promotes angiogenesis through the activation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).', 'Endothelin-1 promotes vascular endothelial growth factor-dependent angiogenesis in human chondrosarcoma cells.', 'Interleukin-6 induces vascular endothelial growth factor expression and promotes angiogenesis through apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 in human osteosarcoma.', 'Regulation of angiogenesis by the kallikrein-kinin system.', 'KLK3 in the Regulation of Angiogenesis-Tumorigenic or Not?', 'Exploration of Site-Specific Drug Targeting-A Review on EPR-, Stimuli-, Chemical-, and Receptor-Based Approaches as Potential Drug Targeting Methods in Cancer Treatment.', 'A modular map of Bradykinin-mediated inflammatory signaling network.', 'Kinins and Their Receptors as Potential Therapeutic Targets in Retinal Pathologies.', 'Plasma Metabolomics Analysis of Polyvinyl Chloride Workers Identifies Altered Processes and Candidate Biomarkers for Hepatic Hemangiosarcoma and Its Development.', 'Transcriptional Regulation of Thrombin-Induced Endothelial VEGF Induction and Proangiogenic Response.']"""

Current TM systems do target either gene-cancer relations or biological processes involving genes and cancers, but the former type produces information not comprehensive enough to explain how a gene affects a cancer, and the latter does not provide a concise summary of gene-cancer relations.  Results:   In this paper, we present a corpus for the development of TM systems that are specifically targeting gene-cancer relations but are still able to capture complex information in biomedical sentences. We describe CoMAGC, a corpus with multi-faceted annotations of gene-cancer relations. In CoMAGC, a piece of annotation is composed of four semantically orthogonal concepts that together express 1) how a gene changes, 2) how a cancer changes and 3) the causality between the gene and the cancer. The multi-faceted annotations are shown to have high inter-annotator agreement. In addition, we show that the annotations in CoMAGC allow us to infer the prospective roles of genes in cancers and to classify the genes into three classes according to the inferred roles. We encode the mapping between multi-faceted annotations and gene classes into 10 inference rules. The inference rules produce results with high accuracy as measured against human annotations. CoMAGC consists of 821 sentences on prostate, breast and ovarian cancers. Currently, we deal with changes in gene expression levels among other types of gene changes.

Subjects and methods:   Study 1. We recruited 24 patients awaiting standard 12-core TRUS-guided biopsies of the prostate to undergo PHS immediately beforehand. We compared PHS with the TRUS-guided biopsy results in terms of their ability to detect cancer within the whole prostate and to localize it to the correct side and to the correct region of the prostate. Lesions that were suspicious on PHS were biopsied separately. Study 2. We recruited 57 patients awaiting TTB to have PHS beforehand. We compared PHS with the TTB pathology results in terms of their ability to detect prostate cancer within the whole gland and to localize it to the correct side and to the correct sextant of the prostate. Study 3. We recruited 24 patients awaiting radical prostatectomy for localized prostate cancer to undergo preoperative PHS. We compared PHS with standardized pathological analysis of the whole-mount prostatectomy specimens in terms of their measurement of total tumour volume within the prostate, tumour volume within prostate sextants and volume of index lesions identified by PHS.  Results:   The PHS-targeted biopsies had an overall cancer detection rate of 38.1%, compared with 62.5% with standard TRUS-guided biopsies. The sensitivity and specificity of PHS for localizing tumour to the correct prostate sextant, compared with standard TRUS-guided biopsies, were 100 and 5.9%, respectively. The PHS-targeted biopsies had an overall cancer detection rate of 13.4% compared with 54.4% for standard TTB. PHS had a sensitivity and specificity for cancer detection in the posterior gland of 100 and 13%, respectively, and for the anterior gland, 6 and 82%, respectively. We found no correlation between total tumour volume estimates from PHS and radical prostatectomy pathology (Pearson correlation coefficient -0.096).

It is currently estimated that inflammatory responses are linked to 15-20% of all deaths from cancer worldwide. PCa is dominated by complications arising from metastasis to the bone where the tumor cells interact with the bone microenvironment impairing the balance between bone formation and degradation. However, the molecular nature of this interaction is not completely understood. Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) counteracts oxidative damage and inflammation. Previous studies from our laboratory showed that HO-1 is implicated in PCa, demonstrating that endogenous HO-1 inhibits bone derived-prostate cancer cells proliferation, invasion and migration and decreases tumor growth and angiogenesis in vivo. The aim of this work was to analyze the impact of HO-1 modulated PCa cells on osteoblasts proliferation in vitro and on bone remodeling in vivo. Using a co-culture system of PC3 cells with primary mice osteoblasts (PMOs), we demonstrated that HO-1 pharmacological induction (hemin treatment) abrogated the diminution of PMOs proliferation induced by PCa cells and decreased the expression of osteoclast-modulating factors in osteoblasts. No changes were detected in the expression of genes involved in osteoblasts differentiation. However, co-culture of hemin pre-treated PC3 cells (PC3 Hem) with PMOs provoked an oxidative status and activated FoxO signaling in osteoblasts. The percentage of active osteoblasts positive for HO-1 increased in calvarias explants co-cultured with PC3 Hem cells. Nuclear HO-1 expression was detected in tumors generated by in vivo bone injection of HO-1 stable transfected PC3 (PC3HO-1) cells in the femur of SCID mice. These results suggest that HO-1 has the potential to modify the bone microenvironment impacting on PCa bone metastasis.""","""['Mercedes Ferrando', 'Xinhai Wan', 'Roberto Meiss', 'Jun Yang', 'Adriana De Siervi', 'Nora Navone', 'Elba Vazquez']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Heme Oxygenase-1 Is a Pivotal Modulator of Bone Turnover and Remodeling: Molecular Implications for Prostate Cancer Bone Metastasis.', 'Critical role of endogenous heme oxygenase 1 as a tuner of the invasive potential of prostate cancer cells.', 'Prostate cancer cells-osteoblast interaction shifts expression of growth/survival-related genes in prostate cancer and reduces expression of osteoprotegerin in osteoblasts.', 'Heme oxygenase-1: emerging target of cancer therapy.', 'Heme oxygenase-1 enhances autophagy in podocytes as a protective mechanism against high glucose-induced apoptosis.', 'Pharmacological Significance of Heme Oxygenase 1 in Prostate Cancer.', 'Carbon Monoxide-Releasing Molecule-3 Suppresses the Malignant Biological Behavior of Tongue Squamous Cell Carcinoma via Regulating Keap1/Nrf2/HO-1 Signaling Pathway.', 'Exploiting Interdata Relationships in Prostate Cancer Proteomes: Clinical Significance of HO-1 Interactors.', 'HO-1 Interactors Involved in the Colonization of the Bone Niche: Role of ANXA2 in Prostate Cancer Progression.', 'Heme Oxygenase-1 Is a Pivotal Modulator of Bone Turnover and Remodeling: Molecular Implications for Prostate Cancer Bone Metastasis.']"""

The purpose of this study was to describe opinions of urologists and radiation oncologists regarding adjuvant and salvage radiotherapy following radical prostatectomy.  Methods:   Urologists and genitourinary radiation oncologists were solicited to participate in an online survey. Respondent characteristics included demographics, training, practice setting, patient volume/experience, and access to radiotherapy. Participant practice patterns and attitudes towards use of adjuvant and salvage radiotherapy in standardized clinical scenarios were assessed.  Results:   One hundred and forty-six staff physicians participated in the survey (104 urologists and 42 genitourinary radiation oncologists). Overall, high Gleason score (Gleason 7 vs. 6, RR 1.37 95% CI 1.19-1.56, p<0.0001 and Gleason 8-10 vs. 6, RR 1.56 95% CI 1.37-1.78, p<0.0001), positive surgical margin (RR 1.43 95% CI 1.26-1.62, p<0.0001), and extraprostatic tumour extension (RR 1.16 95% CI 1.05-1.28, p<0.002) conferred an increased probability of recommending adjuvant radiotherapy. Radiation oncologists were more likely to recommend adjuvant radiotherapy across all clinical scenarios (RR 1.48, 95% CI 1.39, 1.60, p <0.001). Major differences were found for patients with Gleason 6 and isolated positive surgical margin (radiotherapy selected by 21% of urologists vs. 70% of radiation oncologists), and patients with extraprostatic extension and negative surgical margins (radiotherapy selected by 18% of urologist vs. 57% of radiation oncologists).  Conclusions:   Urologists and radiation oncologists frequently disagree about recommendation for post-prostatectomy adjuvant radiotherapy.

Recent studies have indicated the RTK/ERK pathway might be a key pathway in the development of PCa. However, the exact association and evolution-based mechanism remain unclear. This study was conducted by combining genotypic and phenotypic data from the Chinese Consortium for Prostate Cancer Genetics (ChinaPCa) with related databases such as the HapMap Project and Genevar. In this analysis, expression of quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) analysis, natural selection and gene-based pathway analysis were involved. The pathway analysis confirmed the positive relationship between PCa risk and several key genes. In addition, combined with the natural selection, it seems that 4 genes (EGFR, ERBB2, PTK2, and RAF1) with five SNPs (rs11238349, rs17172438, rs984654, rs11773818, and rs17172432) especially rs17172432, might be pivotal factors in the development of PCa. The results indicate that the RTK/ERK pathway under natural selection is a key link in PCa risk. The joint effect of the genes and loci with positive selection might be one reason for the development of PCa.

To investigate the immunoregulatory role of NK cells and their potential as diagnostic markers, NK cell activity (NKA) was analyzed in prostate cancer (PCa) patients with particular focus on NK cell subset distribution.  Methods:   Prospective data of NKA and NK cell subset distribution patterns were measured from 51 patients initially diagnosed with PCa and 54 healthy controls. NKA was represented by IFN-γ levels after stimulation of the peripheral blood with Promoca®. To determine the distribution of NK cell subsets, PBMCs were stained with fluorochrome-conjugated monoclonal antibodies. Then, CD16(+)CD56(dim) and CD16(-)CD56(bright) cells gated on CD56(+)CD3(-) cells were analyzed using a flow-cytometer.  Results:   NKA and the proportion of CD56(bright) cells were significantly lower in PCa patients compared to controls (430.9 pg/ml vs. 975.2 pg/ml and 2.3% vs. 3.8%, respectively; p<0.001). Both tended to gradually decrease according to cancer stage progression (p for trend = 0.001). A significantly higher CD56(dim)-to-CD56(bright) cell ratio was observed in PCa patients (41.8 vs. 30.3; p<0.001) along with a gradual increase according to cancer stage progression (p for trend = 0.001), implying a significant reduction of CD56(bright) cells in relation to the alteration of CD56(dim) cells. The sensitivity and the specificity of NKA regarding PCa detection were 72% and 74%, respectively (best cut-off value at 530.9 pg/ml, AUC = 0.786).  Conclusions:   Reduction of CD56(bright) cells may precede NK cell dysfunction, leading to impaired cytotoxicity against PCa cells.

However, the mechanism of regulation of c-Abl is not known. Here we report that Abl kinases are regulated by a novel microRNA, miR-4723, in prostate cancer. Expression profiling of miR-4723 expression in a cohort of prostate cancer clinical specimens showed that miR-4723 expression is widely attenuated in prostate cancer. Low miR-4723 expression was significantly correlated with poor survival outcome and our analyses suggest that miR-4723 has significant potential as a disease biomarker for diagnosis and prognosis in prostate cancer. To evaluate the functional significance of decreased miR-4723 expression in prostate cancer, miR-4723 was overexpressed in prostate cancer cell lines followed by functional assays. miR-4723 overexpression led to significant decreases in cell growth, clonability, invasion and migration. Importantly, miR-4723 expression led to dramatic induction of apoptosis in prostate cancer cell lines suggesting that miR-4723 is a pro-apoptotic miRNA regulating prostate carcinogenesis. Analysis of putative miR-4723 targets showed that miR-4723 targets integrin alpha 3 and Methyl CpG binding protein in addition to Abl1 and Abl2 kinases. Further, we found that the expression of Abl kinase is inversely correlated with miR-4723 expression in prostate cancer clinical specimens. Also, Abl1 knockdown partially phenocopies miR-4723 reexpression in prostate cancer cells suggesting that Abl is a functionally relevant target of miR-4723 in prostate cancer. In conclusion, we have identified a novel microRNA that mediates regulation of Abl kinases in prostate cancer.

The NLRP3 inflammasome, a protein complex controlling maturation of important pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-18, is also involved in tumorigenesis and metastasis of various cancers.  Methodology/principal findings:   To clarify whether M.hy promoted tumor development via inflammasome activation, we analyzed monocytes for IL-1β and IL-18 production upon M.hy challenge. When exposed to M.hy, human monocytes exhibited rapid and robust IL-1β and IL-18 secretion. We further identified that lipid-associated membrane protein (LAMP) from M.hy was responsible for IL-1β induction. Applying competitive inhibitors, gene specific shRNA and gene targeted mice, we verified that M.hy induced IL-1β secretion was NLRP3-dependent in vitro and in vivo. Cathepsin B activity, K(+) efflux, Ca(2+) influx and ROS production were all required for the NLRP3 inflammasome activation by M.hy.

Methods:   NDRG2 and NDRG3 expression in 206 pairs of primary PCa and corresponding noncancerous prostate tissue samples from the same specimens were detected by immunohistochemistry. The association of NDRG2 and NDRG3 expression with the clinicopathologic features and with the prognosis of PCa was subsequently assessed.  Results:   In PCa tissues, NDRG2 expression was significantly downregulated, while NDRG3 expression was significantly upregulated (both P<0.001), compared with those in corresponding noncancerous prostate tissues. In addition, the downregulation of NDRG2 in PCa tissues was significantly correlated with advanced pathological stage (P=0.001), positive metastatic status (P=0.001) and high Gleason score (P=0.003), while the upregulation of NDRG3 in PCa tissues was significantly correlated with advanced pathological stage (P=0.006), positive metastatic status (P=0.001) and lymph node status (P=0.002).

The aim of this study was to evaluate the association of six polymorphic genotypes of CAV1 with upper urothelial tract cancer within a Taiwanese population.  Materials and methods:   A total of 218 patients with upper urothelial tract cancer and 580 healthy controls in central Taiwan were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) for six CAV1 polymorphic genotypes, C521A (rs1997623), G14713A (rs3807987), G21985A (rs12672038), T28608A (rs3757733), T29107A (rs7804372), and G32124A (rs3807992), and their association with upper urothelial tract cancer susceptibility was examined.

Plasma alkylresorcinol metabolites have been suggested as biomarkers for whole-grain intake in free-living populations.  Methods:   We investigated the major dietary and lifestyle determinants of plasma alkylresorcinol metabolites in a nested case-control study (1,016 cases and 1,817 controls) in the Malmö Diet and Cancer Study. Multivariate adjusted ORs and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were estimated to assess the association between plasma alkylresorcinol metabolites and prostate cancer using logistic regression.  Results:   Whole-grain intake, waist circumference, educational level, and smoking status were the main determinants of alkylresorcinol metabolites. We observed significant correlations between alkylresorcinol metabolites and whole-grain (r = 0.31) and fiber (r = 0.27) intake. Metabolite concentration was positively associated with prostate cancer risk (Poverall effect = 0.0004) but the association was not linear (P = 0.04). The lowest risk was seen among men with moderate plasma concentrations. The OR for high compared with moderate plasma alkylresorcinol metabolites was 1.41 (95% CI, 1.10-1.80) for prostate cancer.  Conclusions:   Results suggest that plasma alkylresorcinol metabolites are mainly determined by whole-grain intake in this nested case-control study of Swedish men. The increased risk of prostate cancer seen among men with high plasma alkylresorcinol metabolites requires further study, but residual confounding, detection bias, or competing risks of nonprostate cancer-related deaths are plausible explanations that could not be ruled out.

Considering prostate cancer heterogeneity, we hypothesised that primitive stem-like cells may constitute the radiation-resistant fraction.  Methods:   Primary cultures were derived from patients undergoing resection for prostate cancer or benign prostatic hyperplasia. After short-term culture, three populations of cells were sorted, reflecting the prostate epithelial hierarchy, namely stem-like cells (SCs, α2β1integrin(hi)/CD133(+)), transit-amplifying (TA, α2β1integrin(hi)/CD133(-)) and committed basal (CB, α2β1integrin(lo)) cells. Radiosensitivity was measured by colony-forming efficiency (CFE) and DNA damage by comet assay and DNA damage foci quantification. Immunofluorescence and flow cytometry were used to measure heterochromatin. The HDAC (histone deacetylase) inhibitor Trichostatin A was used as a radiosensitiser.  Results:   Stem-like cells had increased CFE post irradiation compared with the more differentiated cells (TA and CB). The SC population sustained fewer lethal double-strand breaks than either TA or CB cells, which correlated with SCs being less proliferative and having increased levels of heterochromatin. Finally, treatment with an HDAC inhibitor sensitised the SCs to radiation.  Interpretation:   Prostate SCs are more radioresistant than more differentiated cell populations.

Roll-shaped tissue pieces produced by slicing a prostate biopsy tissue block and trimming the cancer segment were used to obtain a tissue array block. Cancer segments measuring >3 mm were incorporated into the tissue arrays. Cancer fragments (n=253) were obtained from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded needle biopsy specimens. The median number of cancer fragments per patient was four (1-8, min-max). On SA, the median number of confirmed cancer fragments per patient was four (1-7) and 224 cancer fragments (88.5%) were confirmed histologically. Each core of reeled tissue contained at least one cancer fragment. The expressions of multiple prognostic molecular markers for PC (Ki-67, p53 and bcl-2) were immunohistochemically measured using the SA. The Ki-67 and bcl-2 expressions were significantly associated with the Gleason score (GS). A univariate analysis identified Ki-67, bcl-2 and GS as significant predictors of cancer-specific survival, p53 and bcl-2 as significant predictors of overall survival and Ki-67, adjuvant androgen deprivation and GS as significant predictors of biochemical progression.

Materials and methods:   Within 4 hospitals participating in a large active surveillance trial, a side study was initiated. Pelvic magnetic resonance imaging, prostate MP-MRI, and MRGB were performed at 3 and 12 months (latter prostate MP-MRI and MRGB only) after prostate cancer diagnosis in 1 of the 4 participating hospitals. Cancer-suspicious regions (CSRs) were defined on prostate MP-MRI using Prostate Imaging Reporting And Data System (PI-RADS) scores.Risk restratification criteria for active surveillance discontinuance were (1) histopathologically proven magnetic resonance imaging suspicion of node/bone metastases and/or (2) a Gleason growth pattern (GGP) 4 and/or 5 and/or cancer multifocality (≥3 foci) in MRGB specimens of a CSR on MP-MRI.  Results:   From 2009 to 2012, a total of 64 of 82 patients were consecutively and prospectively included and underwent MP-MRI and a subsequent MRGB. At 3 and 12 months of follow-up, 14% (9/64) and 10% (3/30) of the patients were risk-restratified on the basis of MP-MRI and MRGB. An overall CSR PI-RADS score of 1 or 2 had a negative predictive value of 84% (38/45) for detection of any prostate cancer and 100% (45/45) for detection of a GGP 4 or 5 containing cancer upon MRGB, respectively.

Oncogenesis frequently involves changes in their organization or expression. The tetraspanin CD151 is thought to contribute to cancer progression through direct interaction with the laminin-binding integrins α3β1 and α6β1. However, this interaction cannot explain the ability of CD151 to control migration in the absence of these integrins or on non-laminin substrates. We demonstrate that CD151 can regulate tumor cell migration without direct integrin binding and that integrin-free CD151 (CD151(free)) correlates clinically with tumor progression and metastasis. Clustering CD151(free) through its integrin-binding domain promotes accumulation in areas of cell-cell contact, leading to enhanced adhesion and inhibition of tumor cell motility in vitro and in vivo. CD151(free) clustering is a strong regulator of motility even in the absence of α3 expression but requires PKCα, suggesting that CD151 can control migration independent of its integrin associations. The histologic detection of CD151(free) in prostate cancer correlates with poor patient outcome. When CD151(free) is present, patients are more likely to recur after radical prostatectomy and progression to metastatic disease is accelerated. Multivariable analysis identifies CD151(free) as an independent predictor of survival. Moreover, the detection of CD151(free) can stratify survival among patients with elevated prostate-specific antigen levels.

Enhancement of 131I-MIBG's efficacy is achieved by combination with the topoisomerase I inhibitor topotecan - currently being evaluated clinically. Proteasome activity affords resistance of tumour cells to radiation and topoisomerase inhibitors. Therefore, the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib was evaluated with respect to its cytotoxic potency as a single agent and in combination with 131I-MIBG and topotecan. Since elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) are induced by bortezomib, the role of ROS in tumour cell kill was determined following treatment with bortezomib or the alternative proteasome inhibitor, MG132.  Methods:   Clonogenic assay and growth of tumour xenografts were used to investigate the effects of proteasome inhibitors alone or in combination with radiation treatment. Synergistic interactions in vitro were evaluated by combination index analysis. The dependency of proteasome inhibitor-induced clonogenic kill on ROS generation was assessed using antioxidants.  Results:   Bortezomib, in the dose range 1 to 30 nM, decreased clonogenic survival of both SK-N-BE(2c) and UVW/NAT cells, and this was prevented by antioxidants. It also acted as a sensitizer in vitro when administered with X-radiation, with 131I-MIBG, or with 131I-MIBG and topotecan. Moreover, bortezomib enhanced the delay of the growth of human tumour xenografts in athymic mice when administered in combination with 131I-MIBG and topotecan. MG132 and bortezomib had similar radiosensitizing potency, but only bortezomib-induced cytotoxicity was ROS-dependent.  Conclusions:   Proteasome inhibition shows promise for the treatment of neuroblastoma in combination with 131I-MIBG and topotecan. Since the cytotoxicity of MG132, unlike that of bortezomib, was not ROS-dependent, the latter proteasome inhibitor may have a favourable toxicity profile in normal tissues.""","""['Colin Rae', 'Mathias Tesson', 'John W Babich', 'Marie Boyd', 'Robert J Mairs']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""EJNMMI Res""","""['Inhibition of poly(ADP-Ribose) polymerase enhances the toxicity of 131I-metaiodobenzylguanidine/topotecan combination therapy to cells and xenografts that express the noradrenaline transporter.', 'Experimental treatment of neuroblastoma using 131Imeta-iodobenzylguanidine and topotecan in combination.', '131Imeta-iodobenzylguanidine and topotecan combination treatment of tumors expressing the noradrenaline transporter.', '131IMIBG and topotecan: a rationale for combination therapy for neuroblastoma.', 'Radiation quality-dependent bystander effects elicited by targeted radionuclides.', 'Cell cycle specific radiosensitisation by the disulfiram and copper complex.', 'Improved outcome of 131I-mIBG treatment through combination with external beam radiotherapy in the SK-N-SH mouse model of neuroblastoma.', 'Preliminary evaluation of prostate-targeted radiotherapy using (131) I-MIP-1095 in combination with radiosensitising chemotherapeutic drugs.', 'Transcriptomic Signatures of Auger Electron Radioimmunotherapy Using Nuclear Targeting (111)In-Trastuzumab for Potential Combination Therapies.', 'Nothing but NET: a review of norepinephrine transporter expression and efficacy of 131I-mIBG therapy.']"""

We have previously reported on a scheme to produce protein-based self-assembling nanoparticles that can act as antigen display platforms. Here we attempted to use the same system for cancer-targeting, making use of a C-terminal bombesin peptide that has high affinity for a receptor known to be overexpressed in certain tumors, as well as an N-terminal polyhistidine tag that can be used for radiolabeling with technetium tricarbonyl.  Results:   In order to increase circulation time, we experimented with PEGylated and unPEGylated varities typo particle. We also tested the effect of incorporating different numbers of bombesins per nanoparticle. Biophysical characterization determined that all configurations assemble into regular particles with relatively monodisperse size distributions, having peaks of about 33-36 nm. The carbonyl method used for labeling produced approximately 80% labeled nanoparticles. In vitro, the nanoparticles showed high binding, both specific and non-specific, to PC-3 prostate cancer cells. In vivo, high uptake was observed for all nanoparticle types in the spleens of CD-1 nu/nu mice, decreasing significantly over the course of 24 hours. High uptake was also observed in the liver, while only low uptake was seen in both the pancreas and a tumor xenograft.  Conclusions:   The data suggest that the nanoparticles are non-specifically taken up by the reticuloendothelial system. Low uptake in the pancreas and tumor indicate that there is little or no specific targeting. PEGylation or increasing the amount of bombesins per nanoparticle did not significantly improve targeting. In particular, the uptake in the spleen, which is a primary organ of the immune system, highlights the potential of the nanoparticles as vaccine carriers. Also, the decrease in liver and spleen radioactivity with time implies that the nanoparticles are broken down and cleared. This is an important finding, as it shows that the nanoparticles can be safely used as a vaccine platform without the risk of prolonged side effects. Furthermore, it demonstrates that technetium carbonyl radiolabeling of our protein-based nanoparticles can be used to evaluate their pharmacokinetic properties in vivo.""","""['Yongkun Yang', 'Tobias Neef', 'Christian Mittelholzer', 'Elisa Garcia Garayoa', 'Peter Bläuenstein', 'Roger Schibli', 'Ueli Aebi', 'Peter Burkhard']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Nanobiotechnology""","""['PEGylation of (99m)Tc-labeled bombesin analogues improves their pharmacokinetic properties.', 'New 99mTcbombesin analogues with improved biodistribution for targeting gastrin releasing-peptide receptor-positive tumors.', 'The effect of macrocyclic chelators on the targeting properties of the 68Ga-labeled gastrin releasing peptide receptor antagonist PEG2-RM26.', 'Protein-based nanoparticles in cancer vaccine development.', 'Nanoparticle drug delivery systems: an excellent carrier for tumor peptide vaccines.', 'Nanostrategies for Therapeutic and Diagnostic Targeting of Gastrin-Releasing Peptide Receptor.', 'Nanoparticles labeled with gamma-emitting radioisotopes: an attractive approach for in vivo tracking using SPECT imaging.', 'Polymerized porin as a novel delivery platform for coronavirus vaccine.', 'Design and Evaluation of 223Ra-Labeled and Anti-PSMA Targeted NaA Nanozeolites for Prostate Cancer Therapy-Part II.

The association between Cten expression and patient survival was examined using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, and univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were used to estimate the crude and adjusted hazard ratios.  Results:   Strong Cten expression was detected in 7%, 24%, 41%, and 46% of normal nevi, dysplastic nevi, primary melanoma, and metastatic melanoma samples, respectively, and Cten expression was found to be significantly higher in dysplastic nevi compared to normal nevi (P = 0.046), and in primary melanoma compared to dysplastic nevi (P = 0.003), but no difference was observed between metastatic and primary melanoma. Cten staining also correlated with AJCC stages (P = 0.015) and primary tumor thickness (P = 0.002), with Cten expression being induced in the transition from thin (<1 mm) to thick (≥1 mm) melanomas. Strong Cten expression was significantly associated with a worse 5-year overall (P = 0.008) and disease-specific survival (P = 0.004) for primary melanoma patients, and multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that Cten expression was an independent prognostic marker for these patients (P = 0.038 for overall survival; P = 0.021 for disease-specific survival).

Rictor is upregulated via the repression of the miR-424/503 cluster in human prostate and colon cancer cell lines that harbor c-Src upregulation and in Src-transformed cells. The tumorigenicity and invasive activity of these cells were suppressed by re-expression of miR-424/503. Rictor upregulation promotes formation of mTORC2 and induces activation of mTORC2, resulting in promotion of tumor growth and invasion.

Recently, a subfraction of GRP78 is found to localize to the surface of specific cell types, serving as co-receptors and regulating signaling. However, the physiological relevance of cell surface GRP78 (sGRP78) expression in cancer and its functional interactions at the cell surface are just emerging. In this report, we combined biochemical, imaging and mutational approaches to address these issues. For detection of sGRP78, we utilized a mouse monoclonal antibody highly potent and specific for GRP78 or epitope-tagged GRP78, coupled with imaging and biochemical techniques that allowed detection of sGRP78 but not intracellular GRP78. Our studies revealed that breast and prostate cancer cells resistant to hormonal therapy actively promote GRP78 to the cell surface, which can be further elevated by a variety of ER stress-inducing conditions. We showed that sGRP78 forms complex with PI3K, and overexpression of sGRP78 promotes PIP3 formation, indicative of PI3K activation. We further discovered that an insertion mutant of GRP78 at its N-terminus domain, while retaining stable expression and the ability to translocate to the cell surface as the wild-type protein, exhibited reduced complex formation with p85 and production of PIP3. Thus, our studies provide a mechanistic explanation for the regulation of the PI3K/AKT signaling by sGRP78. Our findings suggest that targeting sGRP78 may suppress therapeutic resistance in cancer cells and offer a novel strategy to suppress PI3K activity.""","""['Yi Zhang', 'Chun-Chih Tseng', 'Yuan-Li Tsai', 'Xiaoyong Fu', 'Rachel Schiff', 'Amy S Lee']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Cell Surface GRP78 Accelerated Breast Cancer Cell Proliferation and Migration by Activating STAT3.', 'The COOH-Terminal Proline-Rich Region of GRP78 Is a Key Regulator of Its Cell Surface Expression and Viability of Tamoxifen-Resistant Breast Cancer Cells.', 'Tamoxifen-induced cytotoxicity in breast cancer cells is mediated by glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) via AKT (Thr308) regulation.', 'Cell surface GRP78 signaling: An emerging role as a transcriptional modulator in cancer.', 'Beyond the endoplasmic reticulum: atypical GRP78 in cell viability, signalling and therapeutic targeting.', 'ER chaperone GRP78/BiP translocates to the nucleus under stress and acts as a transcriptional regulator.', 'HSP70 Family in Cancer: Signaling Mechanisms and Therapeutic Advances.', 'Cefoselis enhances breast cancer chemosensitivity by directly targeting GRP78/LRP5 signalling of cancer stem cells.', 'Gastric Cancer Cell-Derived Exosomal GRP78 Enhances Angiogenesis upon Stimulation of Vascular Endothelial Cells.', 'The endoplasmic reticulum stress response in prostate cancer.']"""

However, HT also inevitably evokes stress responses and increases the expression of heat-shock proteins (HSPs) in cancer cells. Among the HSPs, HSP70 is known as a pro-survival protein. In this study, we investigated the sensitizing effect of pifithrin (PFT)-μ, a small molecule inhibitor of HSP70, when three human prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP, PC-3, and DU-145) were treated with HT (43°C for 2 h). All cell lines constitutively expressed HSP70, and HT further increased its expression in LNCaP and DU-145. Knockdown of HSP70 with RNA interference decreased the viability and colony-forming ability of cancer cells. PFT-μ decreased the viabilities of all cell lines at one-tenth the dose of Quercetin, a well-known HSP inhibitor. The combination therapy with suboptimal doses of PFT-μ and HT decreased the viability of cancer cells most effectively when PFT-μ was added immediately before HT, and this combination effect was abolished by pre-knockdown of HSP70, suggesting that the effect was mediated via HSP70 inhibition. The combination therapy induced cell death, partially caspase-dependent, and decreased proliferating cancer cells, with decreased expression of c-Myc and cyclin D1 and increased expression of p21(WAF1/Cip), indicating arrest of cell growth. Additionally, the combination therapy significantly decreased the colony-forming ability of cancer cells compared to therapy with either alone. Furthermore, in a xenograft mouse model, the combination therapy significantly inhibited PC-3 tumor growth. These findings suggest that PFT-μ can effectively enhance HT-induced antitumor effects via HSP70 inhibition by inducing cell death and arrest of cell growth, and that PFT-μ is a promising agent for use in combination with HT to treat prostate cancer.""","""['Kazumasa Sekihara', 'Nanae Harashima', 'Miki Tongu', 'Yukihisa Tamaki', 'Nobue Uchida', 'Taisuke Inomata', 'Mamoru Harada']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['The HSP70 and autophagy inhibitor pifithrin-μ enhances the antitumor effects of TRAIL on human pancreatic cancer.', 'Pifithrin-μ is efficacious against non-small cell lung cancer via inhibition of heat shock protein 70.', 'Effects of combined treatment of chemotherapeutics and hyperthermia on survival and the regulation of heat shock proteins in Dunning R3327 prostate carcinoma cells.', 'Forcing the Antitumor Effects of HSPs Using a Modulated Electric Field.', 'Hyperthermia Treatment as a Promising Anti-Cancer Strategy: Therapeutic Targets, Perspective Mechanisms and Synergistic Combinations in Experimental Approaches.', 'Synthetic Small Molecule Modulators of Hsp70 and Hsp40 Chaperones as Promising Anticancer Agents.', 'Development of handheld induction heaters for magnetic fluid hyperthermia applications andin-vitroevaluation on ovarian and prostate cancer cell lines.', 'Evaluation of the Heat Shock Protein 90 Inhibitor Ganetespib as a Sensitizer to Hyperthermia-Based Cancer Treatments.', 'Therapeutic response differences between 2D and 3D tumor models of magnetic hyperthermia.', 'PES inhibits human-inducible Hsp70 by covalent targeting of cysteine residues in the substrate-binding domain.']"""

We investigated: financial adjustments needed to cope with the cancer-related financial burden; financial distress (defined as a reaction to the state of personal finances); and factors that increase risk of financial difficulties. Two sets of semi-structured face-to-face interviews were conducted with 20 patients with breast, lung and prostate cancer and 21 hospital-based oncology social workers (OSWs) in Ireland, which has a mixed public-private healthcare system. Participants were asked about: strategies to cope with the cancer-related financial burden; the impact of the financial burden on the family budget, other aspects of daily life, and wellbeing. OSWs were also asked about patient groups they thought were more likely to experience financial difficulties. The two interview sets were analysed separately using a thematic approach. Financial adjustments included: using savings; borrowing money; relying on family and friends for direct and indirect financial help; and cutting back on household spending. Financial distress was common. Financial difficulties were more likely for patients who were older or younger, working at diagnosis, lacked social support, had dependent children, had low income or had few savings. These issues often interacted with one another. As has been seen in predominantly publically and predominantly privately-funded healthcare settings, a complex mixed public-private healthcare system does not always provide adequate financial protection post-cancer. Our findings highlight the need for a broader set of metrics to measure the financial impact of cancer (and to assess financial protection in health more generally); these should include: out-of-pocket direct medical and non-medical costs; changes in income; financial adjustments (including financial coping strategies and household consumption patterns); and financial distress.

Methodology/principal findings:   Untreated, hormone-naïve (HN, n = 9) and CRPC bone metastases samples (n = 45) were obtained from 54 patients at metastasis surgery. Non-malignant and malignant prostate samples were acquired from 13 prostatectomy specimens. Transcript and protein levels were analyzed by real-time RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting. No differences in steroidogenic enzyme levels were detected between CRPC and HN bone metastases. Significantly higher levels of SRD5A1, AKR1C2, AKR1C3, and HSD17B10 mRNA were however found in bone metastases than in non-malignant and/or malignant prostate tissue, while the CYP11A1, CYP17A1, HSD3B2, SRD5A2, and HSD17B6 mRNA levels in metastases were significantly lower. A sub-group of metastases expressed very high levels of AKR1C3, which was not due to gene amplification as examined by copy number variation assay. No association was found between AKR1C3 expression and nuclear AR staining, tumor cell proliferation or patient outcome after metastases surgery. With only one exception, high AR-V protein levels were found in bone metastases with low AKR1C3 levels, while metastases with high AKR1C3 levels primarily contained low AR-V levels, indicating distinct mechanisms behind castration-resistance in individual bone metastases.  Conclusions/significance:   Induced capacity of converting adrenal-gland derived steroids into more potent androgens was indicated in a sub-group of PC bone metastases. This was not associated with CRPC but merely with the advanced stage of metastasis.

Material and methods:   A decision-tree model compared three treatment options for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients over 18 months from a societal perspective in 2012 USD. Chance nodes included baseline pain as a severity indicator, significant adverse effects (neutropenia, cardiac events, or seizures), and survival. Probabilities, survival rates, and health utilities were from clinical trials (COU-AA, TROPIC, and AFFIRM) and other published studies. Survival of enzalutamide was adjusted to match placebo groups across trials. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses, acceptability curves and net benefit calculations were performed.  Results:   Abiraterone was the most cost-effective of the treatments ($123.4 K/quality-adjusted life year) compared to placebo, enzalutamide was $437.6 K/quality-adjusted life year compared to abiraterone, and cabazitaxel was $351.9 K/quality-adjusted life year compared to enzalutamide. Enzalutamide and cabazitaxel were not cost-effective compared to placebo at $154.3 K/quality-adjusted life year and $163.2 K/quality-adjusted life year, respectively. Acceptability curves showed abiraterone was cost-effective 29.3% of the time with a willingness to pay threshold of $100 K. The model was sensitive to changes in cost of the drugs, life expectancy, and survival rate. Sensitivity analysis shows that enzalutamide can become the most cost-effective option if the price of the medication decreased by 26% and other drug costs remained the same.  Conclusion:   Based on the cost-effective analysis, and survival adjustments necessary to match placebo groups, we would recommend abiraterone for treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer despite not quite falling under the usually accepted willingness to pay threshold. Further analysis should examine comparative survival across the three drugs.""","""['Leslie Wilson', 'Jun Tang', 'Lixian Zhong', 'Gregory Balani', 'Gregory Gipson', 'Pin Xiang', 'Dawn Yu', 'Sandy Srinivas']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Oncol Pharm Pract""","""['Cost-effectiveness model of abiraterone plus prednisone, cabazitaxel plus prednisone and enzalutamide for visceral metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer therapy after docetaxel therapy resistance.', 'Dutch Economic Value of Radium-223 in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Cost-effectiveness analysis of enzalutamide for patients with chemotherapy-naïve metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer in Japan.', 'Cabazitaxel for Hormone-Relapsed Metastatic Prostate Cancer Previously Treated With a Docetaxel-Containing Regimen: An Evidence Review Group Perspective of a NICE Single Technology Appraisal.', 'Treating Patients with Metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer: A Comprehensive Review of Available Therapies.', 'Cost-effectiveness of docetaxel in high-volume hormone-sensitive metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Cost-effectiveness analyses and cost analyses in castration-resistant prostate cancer: A systematic review.', 'Treatments for Metastatic Prostate Cancer (mPC): A Review of Costing Evidence.', 'Niclosamide and Bicalutamide Combination Treatment Overcomes Enzalutamide- and Bicalutamide-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Cost-Savings Analysis of AR-V7 Testing in Patients With Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Eligible for Treatment With Abiraterone or Enzalutamide.']"""

Methods:   Men were patients of a multidisciplinary prostate cancer clinic at a large tertiary cancer center where patients are routinely briefed on treatment options, including AS. We conducted a thematic analysis of interviews with 15 men who had chosen AS and 15 men who received radiation or surgery.  Results:   Men who chose AS described it as an organized process with a rigorous and reassuring protocol of periodic testing, with potential for subsequent and timely decision-making about treatment. AS was seen as prolonging their current good health and function with treatment still possible later. Rationales for choosing AS included trusting their physician's monitoring, 'buying time' without experiencing adverse effects of treatment, waiting for better treatments, and seeing their cancer as very low risk. Men recognized the need to justify their choice to others because it seemed contrary to the impulse to immediately treat cancer. Descriptions of AS by men who chose surgery or radiation were less specific about the testing regimen. Getting rid of the cancer and having a cure were paramount for them.

However, activation of AR by androgens can also lead to growth suppression and differentiation. Transcriptional cofactors play an important role in this switch between proliferative and anti-proliferative AR target gene programs. Transducin β-like-related protein 1 (TBLR1), a core component of the nuclear receptor corepressor complex, shows both corepressor and coactivator activities on nuclear receptors, but little is known about its effects on AR and prostate cancer. We characterized TBLR1 as a coactivator of AR in prostate cancer cells and determined that the activation is dependent on both phosphorylation and 19S proteosome. We showed that TBLR1 physically interacts with AR and directly occupies the androgen-response elements of the affected AR target genes in an androgen-dependent manner. TBLR1 is primarily localized in the nucleus in benign prostate cells and nuclear expression is significantly reduced in prostate cancer cells in culture. Similarly, in human tumor samples, the expression of TBLR1 in the nucleus is significantly reduced in the malignant glands compared with the surrounding benign prostatic glands (P<0.005). Stable ectopic expression of nuclear TBLR1 leads to androgen-dependent growth suppression of prostate cancer cells in vitro and in vivo by selective activation of androgen-regulated genes associated with differentiation (e.g. KRT18) and growth suppression (e.g. NKX3-1), but not cell proliferation of the prostate cancer.

Methods:   We evaluated the involvement of the vitamin D receptor ligand EB1089 in the regulation of genes with a role in androgen metabolism using the androgen dependent cell lines LNCaP and LAPC-4. EB1089 regulation of androgen metabolism was assessed using QRT-PCR, luciferase promoter assays, western blotting, enzyme activity assays, and LC-MS analyses.  Results:   EB1089 induced significant expression of genes involved in androgen metabolism in prostate cancer cells. Real-Time PCR analysis revealed that VDR mediated significant regulation of CYP3A4, CYP3A5, CYP3A43, AKR1C1-3, UGT2B15/17, and HSD17B2. Data revealed potent regulation of CYP3A4 at the level of mRNA, protein expression and enzymatic activity, with VDR identified as the predominant regulator. Inhibition of CYP3A activity using the specific inhibitor ritonavir resulted in alleviation of the anti-proliferative response of VDR ligands in prostate cancer cells. Mass spectrometry revealed that overexpression of CYP3A protein in prostate cancer cells resulted in a significant increase in the oxidative inactivation of testosterone and DHEA to their 6-β-hydroxy-testosterone and 16-α-hydroxy-DHEA metabolites, respectively.

Additionally, conditioned media (CM) of an osteoblastic PCa xenograft LuCaP 23.1 contained significant levels of PAP and promoted mineralization in mouse and human calvaria-derived cells (MC3T3-E1 and HCO). To demonstrate that PAP promotes mineralization, we stimulated MC3T3-E1 cells with PAP and observed increased mineralization, which could be blocked with the specific PAP inhibitor, phosphonic acid. Furthermore, the mineralization promoted by LuCaP 23.1 CM was also blocked by phosphonic acid, suggesting PAP is responsible for the mineralization promoting activity of LuCaP 23.1. In addition, gene expression arrays comparing osteoblastic to osteolytic CRPC (n = 14) identified betacellulin (BTC) as a gene upregulated during the osteoblastic response in osteoblasts during new bone formation. Moreover, BTC levels were increased in bone marrow stromal cells in response to LuCaP 23.1 CM in vitro. Because new bone formation does occur in osteoblastic and can occur in osteolytic CRPC bone metastases, we confirmed by immunohistochemistry (n = 36) that BTC was highly expressed in osteoblasts involved in new bone formation occurring in both osteoblastic and osteolytic sites.

Aberrant subcellular localisation of PRH is associated with breast cancer and thyroid cancer. Further, in blast crisis chronic myeloid leukaemia, and a subset of acute myeloid leukaemias, PRH is aberrantly localised and its activity is downregulated. Here we show that PRH is involved in the regulation of cell migration and cancer cell invasion. We show for the first time that PRH is expressed in prostate cells and that a decrease in PRH protein levels increases the migration of normal prostate epithelial cells. We show that a decrease in PRH protein levels also increases the migration of normal breast epithelial cells. Conversely, PRH overexpression inhibits cell migration and cell invasion by PC3 and DU145 prostate cancer cells and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Previous work has shown that the transforming growth factor-β co-receptor Endoglin inhibits the migration of prostate and breast cancer cells. Here we show that PRH can bind to the Endoglin promoter in immortalised prostate and breast cells. PRH overexpression in these cells results in increased Endoglin protein expression, whereas PRH knockdown results in decreased Endoglin protein expression.

Methods:   A stratified random sample of 2062 BC, PC and CRC survivors diagnosed between 2003 and 2011 was identified by the Nova Scotia Cancer Registry (NSCR) and mailed a questionnaire assessing PA, social-cognitive constructs from the theory of planned behaviour (TPB), and demographic and medical variables. Structural equation modelling was used to conduct path analyses of the TPB within each cancer survivor group and an invariance analysis was used to compare the TPB across groups.  Results:   A total of 741 completed surveys were analysed. Overall, 42% of cancer survivors were meeting PA guidelines with no differences among the cancer sites. Treatment-related variables were strong correlates of PA in PC survivors but not for BC or CRC. Body mass index was strongly associated with PA in BC survivors but not PC or CRC. Path analyses within each cancer survivor group showed that intention was significantly associated with PA for CRCS only; planning was significantly associated with PA for BCS and PCS only; and perceived behavioural control (PBC) was significantly associated with PA for PCS only. For intention, PBC and instrumental attitude (IA) were significant correlates in all three cancer survivor groups whereas affective attitude (AA) was significant for BCS and CRCS only; and descriptive norm (DN) was significant for PCS and CRCS only. Invariance analyses revealed significantly stronger relationships for (a) intention to planning for BCS compared to PCS, (b) affective attitude to intention for CRCS compared to PCS, and (c) planning to PA for PCS compared to CRCS.

The assessment of serum levels of PSA is currently used for PCa screening but the low specificity of the test results in a high number of false positives. Other forms of PSA may be detected in the bloodstream including PSA associated with immunoglobulin M (PSA-IgM) which, alone or combined with PSA, has shown diagnostic accuracy for PCa.  Objectives:   The aim of the study is to improve the diagnostic accuracy of PSA-IgM by developing a multivariable model which includes serum biomarkers and routine diagnostic parameters to obtain a predictive index useful in the post-screening clinical practice.  Patients and methods:   One hundred sixty male patients with clinical suspect of PCa underwent a trans-rectal ultrasound guided first prostate biopsy with a standardized sampling scheme. To generate the model, we assessed the presence of PSA and PSA-IgM complexes in sera of patients and the prostate volume of each patient. A novel predictive probability for PCa (iXip) was obtained combining non-overlapping biomarkers normalized with diagnostic parameters.  Results:   The study population included 49 patients with PCa diagnosed at biopsy and 111 controls in which prostate biopsy showed the presence of benign prostatic hyperplasia, inflammation, atypical small acinar proliferation or high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia.

Current best practice in radiotherapy accounts for tumor translations, but is unable to address rotation due to a lack of a reliable real-time estimate. We have developed a method based on the iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm that can compute rotation from kilovoltage x-ray images acquired during radiation treatment delivery. A total of 11 748 kilovoltage (kV) images acquired from ten patients (one fraction for each patient) were used to evaluate our tumor rotation algorithm. For each kV image, the three dimensional coordinates of three fiducial markers inside the prostate were calculated. The three dimensional coordinates were used as input to the ICP algorithm to calculate the real-time tumor rotation and translation around three axes. The results show that the root mean square error was improved for real-time calculation of tumor displacement from a mean of 0.97 mm with the stand alone translation to a mean of 0.16 mm by adding real-time rotation and translation displacement with the ICP algorithm. The standard deviation (SD) of rotation for the ten patients was 2.3°, 0.89° and 0.72° for rotation around the right-left (RL), anterior-posterior (AP) and superior-inferior (SI) directions respectively. The correlation between all six degrees of freedom showed that the highest correlation belonged to the AP and SI translation with a correlation of 0.67. The second highest correlation in our study was between the rotation around RL and rotation around AP, with a correlation of -0.33. Our real-time algorithm for calculation of rotation also confirms previous studies that have shown the maximum SD belongs to AP translation and rotation around RL.

However, activation of these receptors which mediate a rapid androgen response can counteract several cancer hallmark functions such as unlimited proliferation, enhanced migration, adhesion and invasion and the inability to induce apoptosis. Here, we investigate the downstream signaling pathways of mAR and identify rapid DHT induced activation of store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) in primary cultures of human prostate epithelial cells (hPEC) from non-tumorous tissue. Consequently, down-regulation of Orai1, the main molecular component of Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ (CRAC) channels results in an almost complete loss of DHT induced SOCE. We demonstrate that this DHT induced Ca2+ influx via Orai1 is important for rapid androgen triggered prostate specific antigen (PSA) release. We furthermore identified alterations of the molecular components of CRAC channels in prostate cancer. Three lines of evidence indicate that prostate cancer cells down-regulate expression of the Orai1 homolog Orai3: First, Orai3 mRNA expression levels are significantly reduced in tumorous tissue when compared to non-tumorous tissue from prostate cancer patients. Second, mRNA expression levels of Orai3 are decreased in prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP and DU145 when compared to hPEC from healthy tissue. Third, the pharmacological profile of CRAC channels in prostate cancer cell lines and hPEC differ and siRNA based knock-down experiments indicate changed Orai3 levels are underlying the altered pharmacological profile.

In this study, using experimental models of intraosseous tumor growth and diet-induced obesity, we demonstrate the promoting effects of marrow fat on growth and progression of skeletal prostate tumors. We reveal that exposure to lipids supplied by marrow adipocytes induces expression of lipid chaperone FABP4, pro-inflammatory interleukin IL-1β, and oxidative stress protein HMOX-1 in metastatic tumor cells and stimulates their growth and invasiveness. We show that FABP4 is highly overexpressed in prostate skeletal tumors from obese mice and in bone metastasis samples from prostate cancer patients.

The measured indicator dilution curves are typically fitted by a mathematical model to estimate the hemodynamic parameters of interest. This paper presents a new maximum-likelihood algorithm for parameter estimation, where indicator dilution curves are considered as the histogram of underlying transit-time distribution. Apart from a general description of the algorithm, semianalytical solutions are provided for three well-known indicator dilution models. An adaptation of the algorithm is also introduced to cope with indicator recirculation.

Methods:   This is a retrospective descriptive epidemiological analysis of all Saudi prostate cancer cases recorded in the Saudi Cancer Registry (SCR) between January 2001 and December 2008. Statistical analyses were conducted using descriptive statistics, the Poisson regression model, a simple linear regression model and analysis of variance with the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 20.0 (SPSS).  Results:   A total of 1739 cases were registered in the SCR between January 2001 and December 2008. The eastern region of Saudi Arabia had the highest overall ASIR at 10.1 per 100,000 men, followed by Riyadh at 7.1 and Makkah at 5.2, while Jizan and Najran had the lowest average ASIRs at 1.4 and at 2.0, respectively. The Poisson regression model for the region of Jizan shows that the incidence rate ratio (IRR) was significantly higher (p < 0.001); for the regions of Riyadh at 3.43 times (95% CI, 3.13-3.73), followed by Makkah at 2.56 (95% CI, 2.38-2.74) and the eastern province at 1.93 (95% CI, 1.64-2.23). The annual prediction of the CIR of prostate cancer in Saudi Arabia could be defined by the equation 1.53 + (0.094 × Years), and the prediction of the ASIR could be defined by the equation 2.98 + (0.182 × Years).  Conclusion:   There was a steady increase in the CIRs and ASIRs for prostate cancer between 2001 and 2008. The eastern region, Riyadh and Makkah had the highest overall ASIR in Saudi Arabia.

With reverse-engineering and an unbiased interrogation of a prostate cancer-specific regulatory network, master regulator analysis discovered that icilin affected cell cycle-related transcriptional modules and identified E2F1 transcription factor as a target master regulator of icilin. Experimental analyses confirmed that icilin reduced the activity and expression levels of E2F1.

Several studies have pointed STEAP1 as a biomarker, but the clinical significance of its overexpression is not fully understood. Therefore, we aimed to establish the association of STEAP1 immunoreactivity with histologic diagnosis and clinical data of patients.  Materials and methods:   Human tissue microarrays were constructed from tissue biopsies of prostate adenocarcinoma (n = 63), including nonneoplastic adjacent tissue (n = 41), prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) lesions (n = 7), and 41 prostate samples from patients diagnosed with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). The histologic features of tumor specimens were classified and clinical and pathologic data were retrieved. STEAP1 expression was evaluated by immunohistochemical analysis, and a semiquantitative quantification was performed using a grade score system based on the intensity and percentage of stained cells.  Results:   Overexpression of STEAP1 protein was found in both plasma membrane and cytoplasm of prostate cancer and PIN lesions when compared with nonneoplastic adjacent tissue and BPH samples. Furthermore, its expression associates positively with higher Gleason scores, but not with other clinical data, such as age, prostate-specific antigen levels, pathologic stage, and metastasis. Regarding its role as a biomarker, STEAP1 is highly liable for distinguishing malignant prostate stages from BPH. On the contrary, it lacks specificity in distinguishing PIN lesions from prostate cancer.  Conclusions:   STEAP1 is consistently overexpressed in malignant prostate tissue, namely adenocarcinoma and PIN lesions. Its overexpression in PIN lesions and positive association with higher Gleason scores suggest that STEAP1 could be involved in tumor initiation and progression. The high sensitivity and specificity for detection of malignant lesions suggests that STEAP1 may be of clinical usefulness in early disease diagnosis.""","""['Inês M Gomes', 'Patrícia Arinto', 'Carlos Lopes', 'Cecília R Santos', 'Cláudio J Maia']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['STEAP1 protein overexpression is an independent marker for biochemical recurrence in prostate carcinoma.', 'PTOV1 expression predicts prostate cancer in men with isolated high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia in needle biopsy.', 'Differential expression of MSX2 in nodular hyperplasia, high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and prostate adenocarcinoma.', 'Intraductal Carcinoma of the Prostate: Morphologic Features, Differential Diagnoses, Significance, and Reporting Practices.', 'Diagnostic limits in precursor lesions of prostatic cancer.', 'STEAP1 Knockdown Decreases the Sensitivity of Prostate Cancer Cells to Paclitaxel, Docetaxel and Cabazitaxel.', 'Targeting advanced prostate cancer with STEAP1 chimeric antigen receptor T cell and tumor-localized IL-12 immunotherapy.', 'Prognostic Significance of Iron Metabolism Related Genes in Human Lung Adenocarcinoma.', 'Development of a TGFβ-IL-2/15 Switch Receptor for Use in Adoptive Cell Therapy.', 'Specific Six-Transmembrane Epithelial Antigen of the Prostate 1 Capture with Gellan Gum Microspheres: Design, Optimization and Integration.']"""

Endpoints included overall response rate and clinical benefit (overall response + stable disease), toxicity, time to radiographic progression, and time to prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression, overall survival, and quality of life.  Results:   Thirty-two patients were enrolled in the study; of these, 77% (n = 25) had Gleason scores ≥ 7. The median age was 74 years (58-89 y), the median PSA level was 66 ng/mL (2-919 ng/mL), and 5 of 32 patients (17%) had liver or lung involvement. The median number of lenalidomide cycles was 3 (1-16 cycles). Stable disease was seen in 20 patients, for a clinical benefit rate of 63%. The median time to radiographic progression was 4 months (2-16 mo); the median overall survival was 20 months.

Methods:   The eligible patients were ≤75 years old and had undergone radical prostatectomy (n = 895), high-dose radiotherapy with or without adjuvant hormonal therapy (n = 1339), or no local treatment (n = 1252). Kaplan-Meier estimates, Cox regression analyses, and competing risk methods were used.  Results:   For all patients, the overall and prostate cancer-specific survival was 89.8% (95% confidence interval 88.8-90.8) and 96.5% (95% confidence interval 95.9-97.1), respectively. Less than 1% of the 76 deaths in patients with low-risk tumors were from prostate cancer. Among the patients with high-risk tumors in the no local treatment group, 48% of the 207 deaths were from prostate cancer compared with 33% of the 81 deaths in the radical prostatectomy and radiotherapy groups (P = .03). On multivariate analysis, local treatment (yes vs no), tumor risk category, and performance status were independently associated with prostate cancer survival, but age was not. No significant differences emerged between the radical prostatectomy and radiotherapy groups. A lack of local treatment and a reduced performance status were significantly associated with reduced prostate cancer-specific survival.  Conclusion:   Although based on only 5 years of observation, we have concluded that patients with low-risk tumors should be informed about the option of active surveillance. Patients with high-risk tumors run a risk of undertreatment if local treatment is not applied.

Patients and methods:   Intracorporeal cooling and extraction (ICE) consists of a modification of the standard RARP technique with the use of the GelPOINT™ (Applied Medical, Rancho Santa Margarita, CA, USA), a hand access platform, which allows for delivery of ice-slush and rapid specimen extraction without compromising pneumoperitoneum.  Results:   The ICE technique reproducibly achieves a temperature of 15 °C in the pelvic cavity with no obvious body temperature change. Adopting this technique during RARP, there was an absolute risk reduction by 26.6% in positive surgical margin rate in patients with pT3a disease when compared with similar patients undergoing conventional RARP (P = 0.04).  Conclusions:   The ICE technique eliminates the potential handicap of decreased tactile sensation for oncological margins, especially in the high-risk patients.

The molecular pathogenesis of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is still poorly understood, and in particular, limited studies are available for intronic lncRNAs expressed in RCC.  Methods:   Microarray experiments were performed with custom-designed arrays enriched with probes for lncRNAs mapping to intronic genomic regions. Samples from 18 primary RCC tumors and 11 nontumor adjacent matched tissues were analyzed. Meta-analyses were performed with microarray expression data from three additional human tissues (normal liver, prostate tumor and kidney nontumor samples), and with large-scale public data for epigenetic regulatory marks and for evolutionarily conserved sequences.  Results:   A signature of 29 intronic lncRNAs differentially expressed between RCC and nontumor samples was obtained (false discovery rate (FDR) < 5%). A signature of 26 intronic lncRNAs significantly correlated with the RCC five-year patient survival outcome was identified (FDR < 5%, p-value ≤ 0.01). We identified 4303 intronic antisense lncRNAs expressed in RCC, of which 22% were significantly (p < 0.05) cis correlated with the expression of the mRNA in the same locus across RCC and three other human tissues. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis of those loci pointed to 'regulation of biological processes' as the main enriched category. A module map analysis of the protein-coding genes significantly (p < 0.05) trans correlated with the 20% most abundant lncRNAs, identified 51 enriched GO terms (p < 0.05). We determined that 60% of the expressed lncRNAs are evolutionarily conserved. At the genomic loci containing the intronic RCC-expressed lncRNAs, a strong association (p < 0.001) was found between their transcription start sites and genomic marks such as CpG islands, RNA Pol II binding and histones methylation and acetylation.  Conclusion:   Intronic antisense lncRNAs are widely expressed in RCC tumors. Some of them are significantly altered in RCC in comparison with nontumor samples. The majority of these lncRNAs is evolutionarily conserved and possibly modulated by epigenetic modifications. Our data suggest that these RCC lncRNAs may contribute to the complex network of regulatory RNAs playing a role in renal cell malignant transformation.""","""['Angela A Fachel', 'Ana C Tahira', 'Santiago A Vilella-Arias', 'Vinicius Maracaja-Coutinho', 'Etel R P Gimba', 'Giselle M Vignal', 'Franz S Campos', 'Eduardo M Reis', 'Sergio Verjovski-Almeida']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Mol Cancer""","""['Expression pattern of long non-coding RNAs in renal cell carcinoma revealed by microarray.', 'Long noncoding intronic RNAs are differentially expressed in primary and metastatic pancreatic cancer.', 'Identification of protein-coding and intronic noncoding RNAs down-regulated in clear cell renal carcinoma.', 'LncRNAs in the Regulation of Genes and Signaling Pathways through miRNA-Mediated and Other Mechanisms in Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma.', 'Long non-coding RNAs in renal cell carcinoma: A systematic review and clinical implications.', 'Sparse Independence Component Analysis for Competitive Endogenous RNA Co-Module Identification in Liver Hepatocellular Carcinoma.', 'm7G regulator-mediated molecular subtypes and tumor microenvironment in kidney renal clear cell carcinoma.', 'Construction of Adipogenic ceRNA Network Based on lncRNA Expression Profile of Adipogenic Differentiation of Human MSC Cells.', 'LncRNA LINC00944 Promotes Tumorigenesis but Suppresses Akt Phosphorylation in Renal Cell Carcinoma.', 'Identification of a nomogram based on an 8-lncRNA signature as a novel diagnostic biomarker for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia.']"""

It has been shown that some of the discomfort associated with the procedure is secondary to spasm of the anal sphincter. Topical diltiazem can relax the anal sphincter. Our aim was to evaluate the use of topical diltiazem cream as an adjunct to periprostatic nerve block in reducing pain associated with TRUS-guided prostatic biopsy.  Method:   Between September 2009 and September 2010, 114 patients were enrolled in the trial (from two centres). Patients undergoing TRUS biopsy of prostate were randomized into diltiazem and placebo groups. Patients were asked to fill out a questionnaire at the end of the procedure. The questionnaire enquired about discomfort associated with various parts of the procedure using a 10-cm visual analogue scale (VAS).  Results:   For discomfort due to the presence of the probe, pain during the biopsy and overall pain prior to leaving the department, mean VAS was higher for the placebo group, but the difference was not statistically significant.  Conclusion:   Diltiazem cream has a better side effect profile than glyceryl trinitrate cream and is better tolerated. Although we have demonstrated trends favouring diltiazem use as an adjunct to local anaesthetic in TRUS biopsy of the prostate, this did not reach a statistically significant level. The pain scores associated with TRUS biopsy in our cohort were lower than those in the published literature.

No monoclonal anti-PLAC1 antibody applicable to immunohis-tochemical staining is available so far. To better understand the PLAC1 expression and localization, we aimed to produce monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against the extracellular region of PLAC1. Mice were immunized with a synthetic peptide corresponding to the C-terminal 11 amino acids of PLAC1 conjugated with a carrier protein. Hybridomas were produced by standard protocol and screened for positive reactivity by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Reactivity of final two clones was then assessed by Western blotting (WB), immunohistochemistry (IHC), and immunocytochemistry (ICC). Both clones showed a specific immunostaining pattern in human term placenta as the positive control. Reactivity was mostly localized to the cytoplasm of syncytiotrophoblasts. One of the clones showed an excellent staining signal in breast, ovary, and prostate cancer cell lines. Importantly, no reactivity was observed with human lymph node cells or prostate. None of the mAbs were able to detect PLAC1 in Western blot.

The objective is to highlight and quantify the bidirectional associations between different oncological diseases. The quantification of the excess or decreased risk of further cancers in cancer patients, in comparison with the general population, may contribute to understand the aetiology of cancer and to address clinical follow-up.  Material and methods:   Data herein presented were provided by AIRTUM population-based cancer registries, which cover nowadays 48% of the Italian population. This monograph utilizes the AIRTUM database (December 2012), considering all malignant cancer cases diagnosed between 1976 and 2010. All cases are coded according to ICD-O-3. Non-melanoma skin cancer cases, cases based on death certificate only, cases based on autopsy only, and cases with follow-up time equal to zero were excluded. To define multiple primaries, IARC-IACR rules were adopted (http://www.iacr.com.fr/MPrules_july2004.pdf). Data were subjected to standard quality control procedures (described in the AIRTUM data management protocol) and specific quality control checks defined for the present study. A cohort of cancer patients was followed over time from first cancer diagnosis until the date of second cancer diagnosis, death, or the end of follow-up, to evaluate whether the number of observed second cancer cases was greater than expected. Person years at risk (PY) were computed by first cancer site, geographic area (North, Centre, South and Islands), attained age, and attained calendar-year group. All second cancers diagnosed in the cohort's patients were included in the observed numbers of cases. The expected number of cancer cases was computed multiplying the accumulated PY by the expected rates, calculated from the AIRTUM database stratified by cancer site, geographic area, age, and calendar-year group. The Standardized Incidence Ratio (SIR) was calculated as the ratio of observed to expected cancer cases. The Excess Absolute Risk (EAR) beyond the expected amount were calculated subtracting the expected number of subsequent cancers from the observed number of cancer cases; the difference was then divided by the PY and the number of cancer cases in excess (or deficit) was expressed per 1,000 PY. Confidence intervals were stated at 95%. The two months (60 days) after first cancer diagnosis were defined as ""synchronicity period"", and in the main analysis observed and expected cases during this period were excluded. It was estimated the excess risk in the period after first diagnosis (≥ 0 months), excluding the synchronicity period (≥ 2 months), and during the following periods: 2-11, 12-59, 60-119 and 120 months after diagnosis. First-cancer-site-and-gender-specific sheets are presented, reporting both SIRs and EARs.  Results:   For 5,979,338 person-years a cohort of 1,635,060 cancer patients (880,361 males and 754,699 females) diagnosed between 1976 and 2010 was followed. The mean follow-up length was 14 years. Overall, 85,399 metachronous (latency ≥2 months) cancers were observed, while 77,813 were expected during the study period: SIR: 1.10 (95%CI 1.09-1.10), EAR: 1.32 x 1,000 person-years (95%CI 1.19 - 1.46). The SIR was 1.08 (95%CI 1.08-1.09) for men (54,518 observed and 50,260 expected) and 1.12 (95%CI 1.11-1.13) for women (30,881/27,553), and the EAR 1.61 (95%CI 1.37-1.84) and 1.08 x 1,000 person-years (95%CI 0.93-1.24), respectively.Moreover, during the first two months after first cancer diagnosis (synchronous period) 14,807 cancers were observed while 3,536 were expected (SIR: 4.16; 95%CI 4.09-4.22); the SIR was 4.08 (95%CI 4.00-4.16) for men and 4.32 (95%CI 4.20-4.45) for women.The mean age of patients at first cancer diagnosis was 67.0 years among males and 65.8 among females.The risk of MP was related to age being higher for younger patients and lower for older ones. In relation to the time of first cancer diagnosis, the SIR was very high at the beginning and then decreased, although remaining constantly over 1, and then rose over time. No strong differences were evident across the different incidence periods, which all showed an increased MP risk.Women had higher SIRs than expected for 18 cancer sites, men for 12. The statistically significantly SIRs lower than 1 were 2 and 8, respectively. Increased overall MP risk was observed for patients of both sexes with a first primary in the oral cavity (SIR men: 1.93; SIR women: 1.48), pharynx (SIR men: 2.13; SIR women: 1.99), larynx (SIR men: 1.57; SIR women: 1.79), oesophagus (SIR men: 1.45; SIR women: 1.41), lung (SIR men: 1.09; SIR women: 1.13), kidney (SIR men: 1.14; SIR women: 1.15), urinary bladder (SIR men: 1.29; SIR women: 1.22), thyroid (SIR: 1.22 in both sexes), Hodgkin lymphoma (SIR men: 1.59; SIR women: 1.94), and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (SIR men: 1.13; SIR women: 1.12), and for the heterogeneous group ""other sites"" (SIR men: 1.09; SIR women: 1.07). Moreover, men had a higher MP risk if the first cancer was in the testis (SIR: 1.24), while the same was true for women with gallbladder (SIR: 1.21), skin melanoma (SIR: 1.17), bone (SIR: 1.41), breast (SIR: 1.12), cervix uteri (SIR: 1.23) and corpus uteri (SIR: 1.23), and ovarian cancer (SIR: 1.18). On the contrary, a first liver or pancreas cancer were associated with a decreased MP risk in both sexes (liver SIR: 0.86 and 0.81 for men and women, respectively; pancreas SIR: 0.70 and 0.78 for men and women, respectively), as were those of colon (SIR: 0.93), rectum (SIR: 0.83), gallbladder (SIR: 0.80), prostate (SIR: 0.93), mesothelioma (SIR: 0.65), and central nervous system (SIR: 0.82) among men. Among the cancers for which the EAR is statistically significant, those with higher Excess Absolute Risk of MP were those of the oral cavity (EAR: 16.0 x 1,000 person-years in men and 5.4 in women), pharynx (17.6 and 9.1), larynx (11.4 and 8.8), and oesophagus (8.5 and 4.8).  Discussion:   This descriptive study provides quantitative information on the risk of developing a second cancer in an Italian population-based cohort of approximately 1.65 million cancer patients, compared to the risk of the general population. During the follow-up time (on average 14 years) cancer patients had an MP risk that was 10% higher in comparison to the general population and an Excess Absolute Risk of 1.32 x 1,000 person-years. Study of MPs and their risk measures are dependent on methods used in the calculation. The definition of MP is not univocal and using different rules can greatly change the number of cancers in a patient with MPs. However, the AIRTUM cancer registries adopt the same recommendations for MP definition. This monograph was therefore made possible by the shared rules and standards used by AIRTUM registries. The cancer site-specific sheets, which represent the core of the monograph, can be useful to highlight and quantify the bidirectional associations among different diseases and therefore provide indications for clinical follow-up. Lifestyle changes in more healthful directions can have a positive effect in the cancer patient population and should always be recommended.""","""['AIRTUM Working Group']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Epidemiol Prev""","""['Italian cancer figures--Report 2015: The burden of rare cancers in Italy.', 'Italian cancer figures, report 2012: Cancer in children and adolescents.', 'Occupation and cancer - follow-up of 15 million people in five Nordic countries.', 'Incidence of Second Primary Malignancies in Patients with Neuroendocrine Tumours.', 'Risk of second cancers cancer after a first primary breast cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Female breast cancer subtypes in the Romagna Unit of the Emilia-Romagna cancer registry, and estimated incident cases by subtypes and age in Italy in 2020.', 'Risks of second non-breast primaries following breast cancer in women: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Risk of second primary cancer among breast cancer patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Second Primary Cancers following Colorectal Cancer in Sicily, Italy.', 'Cancer Cure and Consequences on Survivorship Care: Position Paper from the Italian Alliance Against Cancer (ACC) Survivorship Care Working Group.']"""

Overexpression of miR-96 in LNCaP cells resulted in a reduced FOXO1 expression. Overexpression of FOXO1 induced a strong apoptotic phenotype that was partially rescued by coexpression of miR-96. RT-qPCR and immunohistochemistry of 69 prostate cancer specimens revealed a downregulation of FOXO1 and an inverse correlation of miR-96 and FOXO1 protein expression.

Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) contributes to the growth and survival of many human tumors. This study was undertaken to investigate the anti-tumor activity of scoparone against DU145 prostate cancer cells and to determine whether its effects are mediated by inhibition of STAT3 activity. Scoparone inhibited proliferation of DU145 cells via cell cycle arrest in G1 phase. Transient transfection assays showed that scoparone repressed both constitutive and IL-6-induced transcriptional activity of STAT3. Western blot and quantitative real-time PCR analyses demonstrated that scoparone suppressed the transcription of STAT3 target genes such as cyclin D1, c-Myc, survivin, Bcl-2, and Socs3. Consistent with this, scoparone decreased phosphorylation and nuclear accumulation of STAT3, but did not reduce phosphorylation of janus kinase 2 (JAK2) or Src, the major upstream kinases responsible for STAT3 activation. Moreover, transcriptional activity of a constitutively active mutant of STAT3 (STAT3C) was inhibited by scoparone, but not by AG490, a JAK2 inhibitor. Furthermore, scoparone treatment suppressed anchorage-independent growth in soft agar and tumor growth of DU145 xenografts in nude mice, concomitant with a reduction in STAT3 phosphorylation. Computational modeling suggested that scoparone might bind the SH2 domain of STAT3. Our findings suggest that scoparone elicits an anti-tumor effect against DU145 prostate cancer cells in part through inhibition of STAT3 activity.""","""['Jeong-Kook Kim', 'Joon-Young Kim', 'Han-Jong Kim', 'Keun-Gyu Park', 'Robert A Harris', 'Won-Jea Cho', 'Jae-Tae Lee', 'In-Kyu Lee']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Ginkgetin inhibits the growth of DU-145 prostate cancer cells through inhibition of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 activity.', 'Cryptotanshinone inhibits constitutive signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 function through blocking the dimerization in DU145 prostate cancer cells.', 'Arctigenin enhances chemosensitivity of cancer cells to cisplatin through inhibition of the STAT3 signaling pathway.', 'Scoparone interferes with STAT3-induced proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells.', 'The Pharmacological Effects and Pharmacokinetics of Active Compounds of Artemisia capillaris.', 'Immunomodulatory, Anti-Inflammatory, and Anti-Cancer Properties of Ginseng: A Pharmacological Update.', 'Systematic investigation of the mechanism of herbal medicines for the treatment of prostate cancer.', 'Fraxetin Interacts Additively with Cisplatin and Mitoxantrone, Antagonistically with Docetaxel in Various Human Melanoma Cell Lines-An Isobolographic Analysis.', 'LINC00893 inhibits the progression of prostate cancer through miR-3173-5p/SOCS3/JAK2/STAT3 pathway.', 'High value-added application of a renewable bioresource as acaricide: Investigation the mechanism of action of scoparone against Tetranychus cinnabarinus.']"""

Our studies identified c-jun as a crucial key player which interacts with AR and thus determines the outcome of the taxane therapy given. Docetaxel (Doc) and paclitaxel (Pac) agents showed different effects on LNCaP and LNb4 evidenced by alteration in the protein and mRNA levels of c-jun, AR and PSA. Docetaxel-induced phophorylation of c-jun occurred before JNK phosphorylation which suggests that c-jun phosphorylation is independent of JNK pathways in prostate cancer cells. A xenograft study showed that mice treated with Pac and bicalutamide showed worse outcome supporting our hypothesis that upregulation of c-jun might act as a potent antiapoptotic factor. We observed in our in vitro studies an inverse regulation of PSA- and AR-mRNA levels in Doc treated LNb4 cells. This was also seen for kallikrein 2 (KLK 2) which followed the same pattern.

In order to further characterize the role of EAF2 in the development of prostatic defects, the effects of EAF2 loss were compared in different murine strains. In the current study, aged EAF2(-/-) mice on both the C57BL/6J and FVB/NJ backgrounds exhibited mPIN lesions as previously reported on a 129P2/OLA-C57BL/6J background. In contrast to the 129P2/OLA-C57BL/6J mixed genetic background, the mPIN lesions in C57BL/6J and FVB/NJ EAF2(-/-) mice were associated with stromal defects characteristic of a reactive stroma and a statistically significant increase in prostate microvessel density. Stromal inflammation and increased microvessel density was evident in EAF2-deficient mice on a pure C57BL/6J background at an early age and preceded the development of the histologic epithelial hyperplasia and neoplasia found in the prostates of older EAF2(-/-) animals. Mice deficient in EAF2 had an increased recovery rate and a decreased overall response to the effects of androgen deprivation. EAF2 expression in human cancer was significantly down-regulated and microvessel density was significantly increased compared to matched normal prostate tissue; furthermore EAF2 expression was negatively correlated with microvessel density.

Materials and methods:   Following simulations of transmitter designs not requiring parallel transmission or radiofrequency-shimming, a coil array was constructed using loop elements, with anterior and posterior rows comprising one transmit-receive element and three receive-only elements. This coil structure was optimized using a whole-body phantom. In vivo sequence optimization was performed to optimize achieved flip angle (FA) and signal to noise ratio (SNR) in prostate. The system was evaluated in a healthy volunteer at 3T and 7T. The 7T T2WI was performed in two prostate cancer patients before prostatectomy, and localization of dominant tumors was subjectively compared with histopathological findings. Image quality was compared between 3T and 7T in these patients.  Results:   Simulations of the B1(+) field in prostate using two-loop design showed good magnitude (B1(+) of 0.245 A/m/w(1/2)) and uniformity (nonuniformity [SD/mean] of 10.4%). In the volunteer, 90° FA was achieved in prostate using 225 v 1 ms hard-pulse (indicating good efficiency), FA maps confirmed good uniformity (14.1% nonuniformity), and SNR maps showed SNR gain of 2.1 at 7T versus 3T. In patients, 7T T2WI showed excellent visual correspondence with prostatectomy findings. 7T images demonstrated higher estimated SNR (eSNR) in benign peripheral zone (PZ) and tumor compared with 3T, but lower eSNR in fat and slight decreases in tumor-to-PZ contrast and PZ-homogeneity.

Results:   US men were significantly younger (mean age 58.8 years) than Japanese men (mean age 64.6 years; P < 0.00001). Japanese patients presented with higher PSA levels (mean = 10.9 ng/ml) compared to US patients (mean = 5.8 ng/ml, P < 0.00001) and higher clinical stage (P = 0.003). Japanese tumors were: higher grade; larger; more advanced stage; with increased lymphovascular invasion; and more commonly TZ in location (P < 0.00001). In multivariate analysis, independent predictors of high tumor volume were PSA level, clinical stage, TZ location, Gleason grade, and country of origin (Japan). Independent predictors of TZ location were clinical stage, tumor volume, and country of origin (Japan).  Conclusion:   A major factor for larger, higher grade and stage tumors in Japanese patients is the lower prevalence of screening for prostate cancer in Japan. Another contributing factor may be their TZ location, where they are not palpable until advanced and where they are difficult to sample on needle biopsy possibly leading to a delay in diagnosis.

However, little information is available about the mechanism of tumor cell-induced platelet secretion (TCIPS) or the molecular machinery by which effector molecules are released from platelets. Here we demonstrate that tumor cells directly induce platelet secretion. Preincubation of platelets with human colon cancer (Caco-2), prostate cancer (PC3M-luc), or breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231;MCF-7) resulted in a marked dose-dependent secretion of dense granules. Importantly, TCIPS preceded aggregation which always displayed a characteristic lag time. We investigated the role of platelet receptors and downstream molecules in TCIPS. The most potent modulators of TCIPS were the pharmacologic antagonists of Syk kinase, phospholipase C and protein kinase C, all downstream mediators of the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) cascade in platelets. Supporting this, we demonstrated a central role for the immune Fcγ receptor IIa (FcγRIIa) in mediating platelet-tumor cell cross-talk. In conclusion, we demonstrate that cancer cells can promote platelet dense-granule secretion, which is required to augment platelet aggregation.

However, to the authors' knowledge, the contribution of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening for the early detection of prostate cancer remains unclear and controversial. In the current study, the authors attempted to determine whether improvements in survival over time among patients with metastatic prostate cancer have contributed to the decline in mortality.  Methods:   Men aged ≥ 45 years who presented with de novo metastatic prostate cancer from 1988 to 2009 were identified within the California Cancer Registry. Overall survival and disease-specific survival were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. A multivariate analysis with Cox proportional hazards modeling was performed to adjust for different distributions of variables between groups.  Results:   A total of 19,336 men presented with de novo metastatic prostate cancer during the study period. On multivariate analysis, overall survival was found to be better for men diagnosed from 1988 through 1992 and 1993 through 1998 than for men diagnosed in the most recent era (hazards ratio, 0.78; 95% confidence interval, 0.72-0.85 [P < .001] and HR, 0.79; 95% confidence interval, 0.74-0.86 [P < .001]). There was no improvement in disease-specific survival observed when comparing the most contemporary men (those diagnosed between 2004 and 2009) with those diagnosed between 1988 and 1997.  Conclusions:   In this analysis of men presenting with de novo metastatic prostate cancer, no consistent improvement in overall or disease-specific survival could be demonstrated over time. These data suggest that improvements in survival for patients with advanced disease have not contributed substantially to the observed drop in prostate cancer mortality over the PSA era and that stage migration secondary to PSA screening plays a more prominent role.""","""['Jennifer N Wu', 'Kari M Fish', 'Christopher P Evans', 'Ralph W Devere White', ""Marc A Dall'Era""]""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Cancer""","""['Disease-specific survival of men with prostate cancer detected during the screening interval: results of the European randomized study of screening for prostate cancer-Rotterdam after 11 years of follow-up.', 'Impact of pretreatment factors, biopsy Gleason grade volume indices and post-treatment nadir PSA on overall survival in patients with metastatic prostate cancer treated with step-up hormonal therapy.', 'Prostate-specific antigen screening for prostate cancer and the risk of overt metastatic disease at presentation: analysis of trends over time.', 'Management of advanced/metastatic prostate cancer: 2000 update.', '""Hit the primary"": A paradigm shift in the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer?', 'Impact of non-regional lymph node metastases accurately revealed on 18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT in the clinical management of metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer.', 'PLODs: Novel prognostic biomarkers and potential immunotherapy targets for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.', 'Adaptive and non-adaptive gene expression responses in prostate cancer during androgen deprivation.', 'Network Pharmacology and Molecular Docking Analysis on Molecular Targets and Mechanisms of Bushen Hugu Decoction in the Treatment of Malignant Tumor Bone Metastases.', 'RNA profiling of circulating tumor cells systemically captured from diagnostic leukapheresis products in prostate cancer patients.']"""

Mahanine is a novel carbazole alkaloid derived from the leaves of Murraya koenigii, commonly known as the curry leaf plant, which grows widely across East-Asia. We show here that mahanine possesses the ability to inhibit ligand-dependent and -independent AR transactivation, leading to a prominent decline in AR target gene expression. Mahanine treatment causes a time- and dose-dependent decline in AR protein levels, including truncated AR splice variants, in a panel of androgen-responsive and -independent prostate cancer cells. The decrease in AR levels induced by mahanine occurs posttranslationally by proteasomal degradation, without any change in the AR gene expression. Mahanine treatment induces an outward movement of the AR from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, leading to an initial increase in cytoplasmic AR levels, followed by a gradual decline in the AR levels in both cellular compartments. Ligand-induced AR phosphorylation at Ser-81, a phospho-site associated with prostate cancer cell growth and AR transactivity, is greatly diminished in the presence of mahanine. The decline in AR phosphorylation at Ser-81 by mahanine occurs via the inactivation of mitotic kinase CDK1. Collectively, our data demonstrate that mahanine strongly disrupts AR signaling and inhibits the growth of androgen-dependent and -independent prostate cancer cells, thereby implicating a therapeutic role of mahanine in prostate cancer treatment.""","""['Karishma S Amin', 'Shankar Jagadeesh', 'Gakul Baishya', 'Paruchuri G Rao', 'Nabin C Barua', 'Samir Bhattacharya', 'Partha P Banerjee']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Ther""","""['Identification of kinases regulating prostate cancer cell growth using an RNAi phenotypic screen.', 'Increased PrLZ-mediated androgen receptor transactivation promotes prostate cancer growth at castration-resistant stage.', 'A competitive inhibitor that reduces recruitment of androgen receptor to androgen-responsive genes.', 'Androgen receptor-dependent and -independent mechanisms driving prostate cancer progression: Opportunities for therapeutic targeting from multiple angles.', 'Androgen action in the prostate gland.', 'Nutritive Importance and Therapeutics Uses of Three Different Varieties (Murraya koenigii, Micromelum minutum, and Clausena indica) of Curry Leaves: An Updated Review.', 'Curry Leaf Triggers Cell Death of P. gingivalis with Membrane Blebbing.', 'Palladium-Catalyzed Ortho C-H Arylation of Aniline Carbamates with Diazonium Salts under Mild Conditions: Expedient Synthesis of Carbazole Alkaloids.', 'Future Aspects of CDK5 in Prostate Cancer: From Pathogenesis to Therapeutic Implications.', 'PKCδ Mediates Mineralocorticoid Receptor Activation by Angiotensin II to Modulate Smooth Muscle Cell Function.']"""

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the performance of two DIR algorithms, B-spline-based deformable multipass (DMP) and deformable demons (Demons), implemented in a commercial software package. Evaluations were conducted using both computational and physical deformable phantoms. Based on a finite element method (FEM), a total of 11 computational models were developed from a set of CT images acquired from four lung and one prostate cancer patients. FEM generated displacement vector fields (DVF) were used to construct the lung and prostate image phantoms. Based on a fast-Fourier transform technique, image noise power spectrum was incorporated into the prostate image phantoms to create simulated CBCT images. The FEM-DVF served as a gold standard for verification of the two registration algorithms performed on these phantoms. The registration algorithms were also evaluated at the homologous points quantified in the CT images of a physical lung phantom. The results indicated that the mean errors of the DMP algorithm were in the range of 1.0 ~ 3.1 mm for the computational phantoms and 1.9 mm for the physical lung phantom. For the computational prostate phantoms, the corresponding mean error was 1.0-1.9 mm in the prostate, 1.9-2.4mm in the rectum, and 1.8-2.1 mm over the entire patient body. Sinusoidal errors induced by B-spline interpolations were observed in all the displacement profiles of the DMP registrations. Regions of large displacements were observed to have more registration errors. Patient-specific FEM models have been developed to evaluate the DIR algorithms implemented in the commercial software package. It has been found that the accuracy of these algorithms is patient dependent and related to various factors including tissue deformation magnitudes and image intensity gradients across the regions of interest. This may suggest that DIR algorithms need to be verified for each registration instance when implementing adaptive radiation therapy.""","""['Nick Stanley', 'Carri Glide-Hurst', 'Jinkoo Kim', 'Jeffrey Adams', 'Shunshan Li', 'Ning Wen', 'Indrin J Chetty', 'Hualiang Zhong']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Appl Clin Med Phys""","""['Analysis of deformable image registration accuracy using computational modeling.', 'A finite element method to correct deformable image registration errors in low-contrast regions.', 'Adaptive radiotherapy for NSCLC patients: utilizing the principle of energy conservation to evaluate dose mapping operations.', 'Evaluation of DIR algorithm performance in real patients for radiotherapy treatments: A systematic review of operator-dependent strategies.', 'Registration methods in radiotherapy.', 'Dose accumulation for MR-guided adaptive radiotherapy: From practical considerations to state-of-the-art clinical implementation.', 'Clinical Assessment of a Novel Ring Gantry Linear Accelerator-Mounted Helical Fan-Beam kVCT System.', 'Validation of accuracy deformable image registration contour propagation using a benchmark virtual HN phantom dataset.', 'Rigid and Deformable Image Registration for Radiation Therapy: A Self-Study Evaluation Guide for NRG Oncology Clinical Trial Participation.', 'Adaptive Radiation Therapy (ART) Strategies and Technical Considerations: A State of the ART Review From NRG Oncology.']"""

The true burden of the disease in Nigeria is not known. The study was aimed at studying the community burden of CaP in Lagos.  Methods:   During a community-based prostate cancer awareness program in 13 local government areas of Lagos, men aged >40 years had serum total PSA (tPSA) test and digital rectal examination (DRE). Those with abnormal DRE or tPSA >95th percentile of the cohort or both were selected for prostate biopsy (TRPB).  Results:   4172 men were screened and complete data was available for 4110 (98.5%). The mean age was 60.8 years. DRE was abnormal in 410 men and was significantly correlated with the age of the patient and tPSA (p<0.001). The tPSA ranged from 0 to 438.3 ng/ml with a median, mean and 95th percentile of 1.5, 2.5 and 10.0 ng/ml respectively. 341 out of the 438 (78%) men selected were subjected to TRBP. Forty-three men had histological diagnosis of CaP, giving an estimated prevalence rate of at least 1.046% or 1046 per 100,000 men of age ≥40. Only 11 (26%) had organ-confined disease while 17 (40%) had locally advanced disease and 15 (35%) men had metastatic disease.

Here, we report long-term survival with biomarker correlates from this trial.  Experimental design:   Two hundred and one (134 tasquinimod and 67 placebo) men with mCRPC were evaluated. Forty-one men randomized to placebo crossed over to tasquinimod. Survival data were collected with a median follow-up time of 37 months. Exploratory biomarker studies at baseline and over time were collected to evaluate potential mechanism-based correlates with tasquinimod efficacy including progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).  Results:   With 111 mortality events, median OS was 33.4 months for tasquinimod versus 30.4 months for placebo overall, and 34.2 versus 27.1 months in men with bone metastases (n = 136), respectively. Multivariable analysis demonstrated an adjusted HR of 0.52 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.35-0.78; P = 0.001] for PFS and 0.64 (95% CI, 0.42-0.97; P = 0.034) for OS, favoring tasquinimod. Time-to-symptomatic progression was improved with tasquinimod (P = 0.039, HR = 0.42). Toxicities tended to be mild in nature and improved over time. Biomarker analyses suggested a favorable impact on bone alkaline phosphatase and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) over time and a transient induction of inflammatory biomarkers, VEGF-A, and thrombospondin-1 levels with tasquinimod. Baseline levels of thrombospondin-1 less than the median were predictive of treatment benefit.  Conclusions:   The survival observed in this trial of men with minimally symptomatic mCRPC suggests that the prolongation in PFS with tasquinimod may lead to a survival advantage in this setting, particularly among men with skeletal metastases, and has a favorable risk:benefit ratio.""","""['A J Armstrong', 'M Häggman', 'W M Stadler', 'J R Gingrich', 'V Assikis', 'J Polikoff', 'J E Damber', 'L Belkoff', 'Ö Nordle', 'G Forsberg', 'M A Carducci', 'R Pili']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Clin Cancer Res""","""['Assessment of the bone scan index in a randomized placebo-controlled trial of tasquinimod in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).', 'Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Phase III Study of Tasquinimod in Men With Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Phase Ib Trial of Cabazitaxel and Tasquinimod in Men With Heavily Pretreated Metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC): The CATCH Trial.', 'Efficacy of tasquinimod in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.', 'Effectiveness and tolerability of targeted drugs for the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: a network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.', 'Role of myeloid-derived suppressor cells in tumor recurrence.', 'Overcoming Immune Resistance With Radiation Therapy in Prostate Cancer.', 'Macrophages as a Therapeutic Target in Metastatic Prostate Cancer: A Way to Overcome Immunotherapy Resistance?', 'Correlation Between Imaging-Based Intermediate Endpoints and Overall Survival in Men With Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: Analysis of 28 Randomized Trials Using the Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group (PCWG2) Criteria in 16,511 Patients.', 'Myeloid-derived suppressor cells as immunosuppressive regulators and therapeutic targets in cancer.']"""

Through squeezing of the prostate, a sufficient amount of prostatic proteins was obtained for direct structural analyses of N-glycan structures. N-glycans of PCa compared to BPH were characterized by a significant decrease in triantennary structures (p = 0.047) and overall fucosylation (p = 0.026). Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and the urinary glycoprofile marker showed comparable overall receiver operating characteristic curve analysis as well as in the diagnostic gray zone with serum PSA values between 4 and 10 μg/L. However, when combining PSA and the urinary glycoprofile marker, the latter gave an additive diagnostic value to serum PSA (p ≤ 0.001).

Levatores prostate was visualized on a cadaver dissection previously.  Patients and methods:   Eighty outpatients with lower urinary tract complaints or were suspected clinically to have prostate cancer were submitted to TRUS-guided prostate biopsy. The ages of outpatients were ranging from 45 to 81. Patients were randomized in 2 groups: Group-I, with 40 patients submitted to local anesthesia by periprostatic injection of 1 cc 1% lidocaine before biopsy; and group-II, with 40 controls the biopsy was performed without local anesthesia. The anatomical region for anesthesia was determined via dissection. The name of this anatomical region is levatores prostatae and it has got high nerve density. The process was explained to the patients and their approvals were obtained. Levatores prostatae was detected with TRUS before biopsy. Pain; related to digital rectal examination (DRE), probe insertion or biopsy, was scored via visual analog scale (VAS). The patients were evaluated about side effects of lidocaine and early and late complications of biopsy as well.  Results:   Both groups were similar in terms of mean age, PSA levels, prostate volume and VAS scores (p > 0.05). As for VAS score, on the group submitted to anesthesia was determined 2.34 ± 1.08, while for VAS score on the group submitted conventional biopsy was determined 5.8 ± 1.6. Between two groups, there was a statistical difference in terms of VSA score (p < 0.05); but there was no statistical difference about early and late complications of biopsy.  Conclusions:   The periprostatic blockage use is clearly associated with more tolerance and patient comfort during TRUS-guided biopsy.

This study examines the effects of cancer patients' exposure to cancer-related DTCA on subsequent health information seeking behaviors from clinician and non-clinician sources (lay media and interpersonal contacts). Using a longitudinal survey design over 3 years, data was collected from cancer survivors diagnosed with colorectal, breast, or prostate cancer who were randomly sampled from the Pennsylvania Cancer Registry. Study outcome measures include patients' information engagement with their clinicians and information seeking from non-medical sources about cancer treatment and quality of life issues, measured in the second survey. The predictor variable is the frequency of exposure to cancer-related DTCA since diagnosis, measured at the round 1 survey. The analyses utilized lagged-weighted multivariate regressions and adjusted for round 1 levels of patient-clinician engagement, information seeking from nonmedical sources, and confounders. Exposure to cancer-related DTCA is associated with increased levels of subsequent patient-clinician information engagement (B = .023, 95% CI = .005-.040, p = .012), controlling for confounders. In comparison, exposure to DTCA is marginally significant in predicting health information seeking from non-clinician sources (B = .009, 95% CI = -.001-.018, p = .067). Cancer-related DTCA has potentially beneficial spillover effects on health information seeking behaviors among cancer patients.

This paper considers available research to explore what may hinder or facilitate minority ethnic access to cancer genetics services. We sought to inform service development for people of South Asian, African or Irish origin at risk of familial breast, ovarian, colorectal and prostate cancers in the UK. Relevant studies from the UK, North America and Australasia were identified from six electronic research databases. Current evidence is limited but suggests low awareness and understanding of familial cancer risk among minority ethnic communities studied. Socio-cultural variations in beliefs, notably stigma about cancer or inherited risk of cancer, are identified. These factors may affect seeking of advice from providers and disparities in referral. Achieving effective cross-cultural communication in the complex contexts of both cancer and genetics counselling, whether between individuals and providers, when mediated by third party interpreters, or within families, pose further challenges. Some promising experience of facilitating minority ethnic access has been gained by introduction of culturally sensitive provider and counselling initiatives, and by enabling patient self-referral. However, further research to inform and assess these interventions, and others that address the range of challenges identified for cancer genetics services are needed. This should be based on a more comprehensive understanding of what happens at differing points of access and interaction at community, cancer care and genetic service levels.""","""['Anna Allford', 'Nadeem Qureshi', 'Julian Barwell', 'Celine Lewis', 'Joe Kai']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Eur J Hum Genet""","""['Treatment of culturally diverse children and adolescents with depression.', 'Improving access to cancer genetics services in primary care: socio-economic data from North Kirklees.', 'Developing resources to facilitate culturally-sensitive service planning and delivery - doing research inclusively with people with learning disabilities.', 'Palliative care experiences of adult cancer patients from ethnocultural groups: a qualitative systematic review protocol.', 'Awareness, knowledge, perceptions, and attitudes towards genetic testing for cancer risk among ethnic minority groups: a systematic review.', 'Implementation of a Population-Based Cancer Family History Screening Program for Lynch Syndrome.', 'Psychological factors and the uptake of preventative measures in BRCA1/2 pathogenic variant carriers: results of a prospective cohort study.', 'Testing a deliberative democracy method with citizens of African ancestry to weigh pros and cons of targeted screening for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer risk.', 'Interest in genetic testing and risk-reducing behavioral changes: results from a community health assessment in New York City.', 'Investigating disparity in access to Australian clinical genetic health services for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.']"""

Due to their restricted expression in normal adult tissues, CTAs have been attractive targets for immunotherapy and biomarker development. In this work, we discovered that Centrin 1 (CETN1) which is found in the centrosome of all eukaryotes, may be a member of this group and is highly expressed in prostate and pancreatic cancer. Three members of the centrin family of calcium binding proteins (CETN) are localized to the centrosome in all eukaryotes with CDC31 being the sole yeast homolog. CETN1 is a retrogene that probably arose from a retrotransposition of CETN2, an X-linked gene. A previous mouse study shows that CETN1 is expressed solely in the testis, while CETN2 is expressed in all organs.  Results:   In this work, we show that CETN1 is a new member of the growing group of CTAs. Through the mining of publicly available microarray data, we discovered that human CETN1 expression but not CETN2 or CETN3 is restricted to the testis. In fact, CETN1 is actually down-regulated in testicular malignancies compared to normal testis. Using q-PCR, CETN1 expression is shown to be highly up-regulated in cancer of the prostate and in pancreatic xenografts. Unexpectedly however, CETN1 expression was virtually absent in various cell lines until they were treated with the DNA demethylation agent 5'AZA-2'Deoxycytidine (AZA) but showed no increased expression upon incubation with Histone deacetylase inhibitor Trichostatin-A (TSA) alone. Additionally, like most CTAs, CETN1 appears to be an intrinsically disordered protein which implies that it may occupy a hub position in key protein interaction networks in cancer. Neither CETN1 nor CETN2 could compensate for loss of CDC31 expression in yeast which is analogous to published data for CETN3.  Conclusions:   This work suggests that CETN1 is a novel CTA with expression in cancer of the prostate and pancreas. In cell lines, the expression is probably regulated by promoter methylation, while the method of regulation in normal adult tissues remains unknown.""","""['John J Kim', 'Krithika Rajagopalan', 'Basil Hussain', 'Brenten H Williams', 'Prakash Kulkarni', 'Steven M Mooney']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Biomark Res""","""['Evaluation of novel highly specific antibodies to cancer testis antigen Centrin-1 for radioimmunoimaging and radioimmunotherapy of pancreatic cancer.', 'Testis-specific murine centrin, Cetn1: genomic characterization and evidence for retroposition of a gene encoding a centrosome protein.', 'Deletion of both centrin 2 (CETN2) and CETN3 destabilizes the distal connecting cilium of mouse photoreceptors.', 'Cancer/Testis Antigens: Expression, Regulation, Tumor Invasion, and Use in Immunotherapy of Cancers.', 'Cancer/Testis Antigens: ""Smart"" Biomarkers for Diagnosis and Prognosis of Prostate and Other Cancers.', 'Radioimmunotherapy of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma: A Review of the Current Status of Literature.', 'Evaluation of novel highly specific antibodies to cancer testis antigen Centrin-1 for radioimmunoimaging and radioimmunotherapy of pancreatic cancer.', 'Tissue-specific Co-expression of Long Non-coding and Coding RNAs Associated with Breast Cancer.', 'Molecular mechanisms of OLIG2 transcription factor in brain cancer.', 'A Panel of Cancer Testis Antigens and Clinical Risk Factors to Predict Metastasis in Colorectal Cancer.']"""

A good correlation (R(2) = 0.91) was observed for the measurable AGR2 concentrations in urine between SRM and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). On the basis of an initial cohort of 37 subjects, urinary AGR2/PSA concentration ratios showed a significant difference (P = 0.026) between noncancer and cancer.

However, their use as therapeutic agents is hindered by two important limitations: their low stability and the activation of the innate immune response. Recently, we developed a new type of molecule to decrease gene expression named polypurine reverse Hoogsteen hairpins (PPRHs) that bind to polypyrimidine targets in the DNA. Herein, stability experiments performed in mouse, human, and fetal calf serum and in PC3 cells revealed that the half-life of PPRHs is much longer than that of siRNAs in all cases. Usage of PPRHs with a nicked-circular structure increased the binding affinity to their target sequence and their half-life in FCS when bound to the target. Regarding the innate immune response, we determined that the levels of the transcription factors IRF3 and its phosphorylated form, as well as NF-κB were increased by siRNAs and not by PPRHs; that the expression levels of several proinflammatory cytokines including IL-6, TNF-α, IFN-α, IFN-ß, IL-1ß, and IL-18 were not significantly increased by PPRHs; and that the cleavage and activation of the proteolytic enzyme caspase-1 was not triggered by PPRHs.

Methods:   We conducted a nested case-control study (n = 526 lung cancer patients and n = 592 control subjects) within the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial. Control subjects were matched to lung cancer case patients on age, sex, follow-up time (median = 2.9 years), randomization year, and smoking (pack-years and time since quitting). Serum levels of 77 inflammation markers were measured using a Luminex bead-based assay. Conditional logistic regression and weighted Cox models were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and cumulative risks, respectively.  Results:   Of 68 evaluable markers, 11 were statistically significantly associated with lung cancer risk (P trend across marker categories < .05), including acute-phase proteins (C-reactive protein [CRP], serum amyloid A [SAA]), proinflammatory cytokines (soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor 2 [sTNFRII]), anti-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin 1 receptor antagonist [IL-1RA]), lymphoid differentiation cytokines (interleukin 7 [IL-7]), growth factors (transforming growth factor alpha [TGF-A]), and chemokines (epithelial neutrophil-activating peptide 78 [ENA 78/CXCL5], monokine induced by gamma interferon [MIG/CXCL9], B cell-attracting chemokine 1 [BCA-1/CXCL13], thymus activation regulated chemokine [TARC/CCL17], macrophage-derived chemokine [MDC/CCL22]). Elevated marker levels were associated with increased lung cancer risk, with odds ratios comparing the highest vs the lowest group ranging from 1.47 (IL-7) to 2.27 (CRP). For IL-1RA, elevated levels were associated with decreased lung cancer risk (OR = 0.71; 95% confidence interval = 0.51 to 1.00). Associations did not differ by smoking, lung cancer histology, or latency. A cross-validated inflammation score using four independent markers (CRP, BCA-1/CXCL13, MDC/CCL22, and IL-1RA) provided good separation in 10-year lung cancer cumulative risks among former smokers (quartile [Q] 1 = 1.1% vs Q4 = 3.1%) and current smokers (Q1 = 2.3% vs Q4 = 7.9%) even after adjustment for smoking.

We also investigated how RRP influences the development of inguinal hernias and impacts their repair.  Methods:   Among 488 adult male patients who underwent inguinal hernia repair during a recent 5-year period, 37 had a history of RRP. We compared the characteristics and surgical outcomes of the patients who had undergone RRP (post-RRP group) with those who had not (non-RRP group).  Results:   All post-RRP hernias were treated by MP. The 37 post-RRP patients had a collective 41 hernias, 40 of which were of the indirect type. The side affected by the hernia did not differ significantly between the groups. We compared the short-term surgical outcomes of the indirect post-RRP hernias vs. the indirect non-RPP hernias without recurrence and incarceration. The operation times, postoperative hospital stay, and mobility rates did not differ significantly between the two groups. The blood loss was almost equal in both groups.  Conclusion:   Inguinal hernia repair after RRP may be difficult because of inflammatory changes in the preperitoneal cavity, but the surgical outcomes of MP were equivalent in patients with or without a history of RPP in this study.

We recently identified serum response factor (SRF) as a key transcription factor in an in vitro model of castration resistance where we showed that SRF inhibition resulted in reduced cellular proliferation. We also demonstrated an association between SRF protein expression and CRPC in a cohort of castrate-resistant transurethral resections of the prostate (TURPS). The mechanisms regulating the growth of CRPC bone and visceral metastases have not been explored in depth due to the paucity of patient-related material available for analysis. In this study, we aim to evaluate SRF protein expression in prostate cancer (PCa) metastases, which has not previously been reported.  Methods and results:   We evaluated the nuclear tissue expression profile of SRF by immunohistochemistry in 151 metastatic sites from 42 patients who died of advanced PCa. No relationship between SRF nuclear expression and the site of metastasis was observed (P = 0.824). However, a negative association between SRF nuclear expression in bone metastases and survival from (a) diagnosis with PCa (P = 0.005) and (b) diagnosis with CRPC (P = 0.029) was seen. These results demonstrate that SRF nuclear expression in bone metastases is associated with survival, with patients with the shortest survival showing high SRF nuclear expression and patients with the longest survival having low SRF nuclear expression.  Conclusion:   Our study indicates that SRF is a key factor determining patients' survival in metastatic CRPC and therefore may represent a promising target for future therapies.""","""[""Gillian O'Hurley"", 'Maria Prencipe', 'Dara Lundon', ""Amanda O'Neill"", 'Susie Boyce', ""Anthony O'Grady"", 'William M Gallagher', 'Colm Morrissey', 'Elaine W Kay', 'R William G Watson']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['The prognostic utility of the transcription factor SRF in docetaxel-resistant prostate cancer: in-vitro discovery and in-vivo validation.', 'Epithelial mesenchymal-like transition occurs in a subset of cells in castration resistant prostate cancer bone metastases.', 'Is computed tomography a necessary part of a metastatic evaluation for castration-resistant prostate cancer?

This study aimed to explore whether OnfFN may identify benign and common urinary diseases.  Methods:   The urine OnfFN concentrations from patients who had bladder TCC (8 patients), benign urinary diseases (10 benign prostatic enlargement [BPE] patients, 10 urolithiasis patients), or controls (10 healthy individuals) were determined by ELISA and compared.  Results:   The urine OnfFN concentration was significantly higher in patients with bladder TCC and lithiasis (mean ± SE 0.43 ± 0.18 and 0.45 ± 0.23 ug/mL) than in patients with BPE and in healthy individuals (0.15 ± 0.06 and 0.10 ± 0.02 ug/mL, p<0.05). The urine OnfFN level (cutoff value 0.038 μg/mL), was able to identify 75% of patients with bladder TCC, 60% of patients with BPE and 80% of patients with urolithiasis, achieving a sensitivity of 0.75 for the recognition of either cancer or a urinary disorder. The OnfFN level had a high sensitivity (0.9) for the identification of urolithiasis.  Conclusion:   The urine OnfFN level proved helpful in the identification of bladder TCC patients.

Patients treated with DES during the castration-resistant phase following the failure of prior treatment with LH-RH analogs during the castration-sensitive phase were retrieved from a prostate cancer database of our institution. Patients were treated with a daily dose of DES of 1-4 mg (mean, 2.6 mg) and anticoagulants for thromboembolic prophylaxis until disease progression. We analyzed their medical records, biochemical prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response and time to disease progression (TDP). Disease response and progression were identified according to the PCWG2 criteria. Patient data were examined using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and statistical correlation tests with intra-patient comparison of the LH-RH and DES treatment phases. Forty-three DES-treated CRPC patients were found in our database through July 2011. The median age was 66 years. Sixty-three percent of the patients achieved a ≥50% decline in their serum PSA levels during DES therapy. Median TDP was 20.4 months for LH-RH analog treatment in the castration-sensitive phase, and 7.1 months for DES treatment in the castration-resistant phase. Durable responses (>1 year) were observed in 31% of the patients. Median overall survival was 57 months from the start of the DES therapy. There was no significant correlation between the TDP under LH-RH analogs and under DES therapy among the 38 patients eligible for correlation analysis. However, the magnitudes of serum PSA responses under DES and LH-RH analogs were significantly correlated with each other, and with the TDP under DES therapy. There were no treatment-related deaths. Four patients (9%) developed thromboembolic complications while under treatment, some of which appeared to be related to a discontinuation of thromboprophylaxis. In conclusion, DES confers substantial clinical benefit in the treatment of CRPC, with a relatively good safety profile when administered with thromboprophylaxis. The use of DES may be effective in CRPC, irrespective of the length of the hormone-sensitive period with LH-RH treatment. The magnitude of PSA response to previous treatment with LH-RH analogs, as well as to DES, was predictive of the duration of response to DES.""","""['Tal Grenader', 'Yevgeni Plotkin', 'Maya Gips', 'Nathan Cherny', 'Alberto Gabizon']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Oncol Rep""","""['The mechanism of action of estrogen in castration-resistant prostate cancer: clues from hormone levels.', 'Diethylstilboestrol (1 mg) in the management of castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Diethylstilbestrol in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Current role of diethylstilbestrol in the management of advanced prostate cancer.', 'The nonsteroidal effects of diethylstilbestrol: the rationale for androgen deprivation therapy without estrogen deprivation in the treatment of prostate cancer.', 'In Vitro and Vivo Identification, Metabolism and Action of Xenoestrogens: An Overview.', 'The resurgence of estrogens in the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Diethylstilbestrol in the Treatment of Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer: A Lower-middle-income Country Experience.', 'Favourable response of serum prostate-specific antigen to conjugated oestrogen in castrate-resistant prostate cancer in Jamaica.', 'Understanding prostate-specific antigen dynamics in monitoring metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: implications for clinical practice.']"""

This study examined the effect of clofibrate on heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) gene expression in A2780 (human ovarian cancer) and DU145 (human prostate cancer) cells.  Methods and results:   We demonstrate that clofibrate induces HO-1 expression in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. The induction of HO-1 by clofibrate was detected at both mRNA and protein levels and the HO-1 gene promoter activity was also dramatically induced by clofibrate, indicating that clofibrate up-regulates HO-1 gene transcription. Surprisingly, the induction of HO-1 by clofibrate was mediated by the Nrf2 signaling pathway, not by the PPARα pathway. This was primarily demonstrated by siRNA knockdown of Nrf2 expression that significantly attenuated clofibrate-induced HO-1 gene transcription, and siRNA knockdown of PPARα that had no effect on clofibrate-induced HO-1 promoter activity. Furthermore, deletion of the antioxidant response elements (AREs) in the HO-1 gene promoter diminished clofibrate-induced HO-1 transcription and deletion of the PPAR response elements (PPREs) had no such effect. Likewise, application of PPARα antagonists had no effect on clofibrate-induced HO-1 expression.  Conclusion:   Clofibrate induces HO-1 gene expression in cancer cells through a PPARα-independent mechanism and the Nrf2 signaling pathway is indispensible for this induction.""","""['Shuai Wang', 'Bethany N Hannafon', 'Jundong Zhou', 'Wei-Qun Ding']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Cell Physiol Biochem""","""['Zinc at sub-cytotoxic concentrations induces heme oxygenase-1 expression in human cancer cells.', 'Characterization of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)-induced heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression in human cancer cells: the importance of enhanced BTB and CNC homology 1 (Bach1) degradation.', 'PPARα activation sensitizes cancer cells to epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) treatment via suppressing heme oxygenase-1.', 'Oncogenic potential of Nrf2 and its principal target protein heme oxygenase-1.', 'Regulation of the Expression of Heme Oxygenase-1: Signal Transduction, Gene Promoter Activation, and Beyond.', 'Excess Heme Promotes the Migration and Infiltration of Macrophages in Endometrial Hyperplasia Complicated with Abnormal Uterine Bleeding.', 'Heme oxygenase 1: a novel oncogene in multiple gynecological cancers.', 'Self-regulation of the inflammatory response by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors.', 'Haem oxygenase-1 up-regulation by rosiglitazone via ROS-dependent Nrf2-antioxidant response elements axis or PPARγ attenuates LPS-mediated lung inflammation.', 'Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are potential drug targets for cancer therapy.']"""

This may be related to tumour burden and/or enhanced by systemic therapy. While there is ample evidence regarding venous thromboembolism, systematic studies investigating arterial thrombotic events are scarce. Conventional coagulation tests have limited capacity in evaluating the coagulability or the need for anticoagulant prophylaxis. In this pilot study, we investigated whether assessment of global haemostasis using thromboelastography (TEG) and quantification of plasma pro-coagulant microparticles can help determine the risk of adverse thrombotic events in patients with prostate cancer (PCa). Thirty two patients were recruited a priori into three groups: 11 men on 'watchful waiting' following recurrent disease after definitive treatment (Group A); 10 patients with metastatic disease on Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) (Group B); and 11 with castration resistant cancer (Group C) and followed up over a period of 12months. These patients were compared to a control group composed of 8 men with negative prostate biopsy. Whole blood TEG and plasma tissue factor-carrying microparticles (TF-MPs) in addition to basic coagulation testing, plasma fibrinogen and d-dimer were performed. 22/32 (68.8%) of the patients demonstrated hypercoagulable TEG traces. Hypercoagulability was marked in group B compared to the control. Plasma MPs were significantly elevated in patients compared to the controls with significant increase in group B. All other coagulation tests were normal. Seven of the 22 hypercoagulable patients (31.8%) developed one or more thromboembolic events over 12months follow up period. The data in this pilot study show that PCa patients are hypercoagulable, particularly those with advanced disease on ADT and that this hypercoagulability can be identified by TEG.

Materials and methods:   Male patients with clinical BPH, elevated serum PSA (> 4 ng/ml), and significant LUTS (International Prostate Symptom Score [IPSS] ≥ 8) were randomly assigned to receive doxazosin 4 mg daily plus celecoxib 200 mg daily (study group) or doxazosin 4 mg daily alone (control group) for 3 months.

Unfortunately, androgen deprivation therapies eventually become ineffective, leading to deadly castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). One of many factors implicated in the transition to CRPC is the onset of de novo steroidogenesis. Although reactivation of steroid receptors likely plays a pivotal role in aggressive CRPC, little is understood regarding the mechanisms whereby prostate cancer cells initiate and maintain steroidogenesis. We hypothesize that steroidogenic factor 1 (SF1, NR5A1, AD4BP), a key regulator of steroidogenesis in normal endocrine tissues, is expressed in CRPC where it stimulates aberrant steroidogenesis and fuels aggressive growth. Notably, SF1 is not expressed in normal prostate tissue. Our results indicated that SF1 was absent in benign cells but present in aggressive prostate cancer cell lines. Introduction of ectopic SF1 expression in benign human prostate epithelial cells (BPH-1) stimulated increased steroidogenic enzyme expression, steroid synthesis, and cell proliferation. In contrast, data from an aggressive human prostate cancer cell line (BCaPT10) demonstrated that SF1 was required for steroid-mediated cell growth because BCaPT10 cell growth was diminished by abiraterone treatment and short hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown of SF1 (shSF1). SF1-depleted cells also exhibited defective centrosome homeostasis. Finally, whereas xenograft experiments in castrated hosts with BCaPT10 control transplants grew large, invasive tumors, BCaPT10-shSF1 knockdown transplants failed to grow. Therefore, we conclude that SF1 stimulates steroid accumulation and controls centrosome homeostasis to mediate aggressive prostate cancer cell growth within a castrate environment.

However, it is unknown if GPR39 is mediating Zn(2+) -dependent signaling in prostate and salivary tissue where changes in zinc concentrations are frequent and of physiological significance. Here, we show that GPR39 is mediating Zn(2+) -dependent Ca(2+) responses and is regulating activity of MAP and PI3 pathways in prostate cancer cells, PC3, and ductal salivary gland cells, HSY. We next ask whether ZnR/GPR39 interacts with other GPCR family members. We find that endogenous ZnR/GPR39 activity is regulated by the expression and activity of another cation sensing GPCR, the Ca(2+) -sensing receptor (CaSR). Although CaSR is not activated by Zn(2+), co-expression of CaSR and ZnR/GPR39 synergistically enhances Ca(2+) responses in PC3 and HSY cells. Silencing of the CaSR using siRNA or a dominant negative construct reduces the Zn(2+) -dependent signaling. Importantly, overexpression of GPR39 in HEK293 cells is sufficient to trigger Zn(2+) -dependent responses. Nevertheless, application of the CaSR agonist spermine, at concentration below its threshold, enhanced Zn(2+) -dependent Ca(2+) response.

However, in prostate tumors, increased GLCE expression is associated with advanced disease, suggesting versatile effects of GLCE in different cancers. To investigate further the potential cancer-promoting effect of GLCE in prostate cancer, GLCE was ectopically re-expressed in morphologically different LNCaP and PC3 prostate cancer cells. Transcriptional profiles of normal PNT2 prostate cells, LNCaP, PC3 and DU145 prostate cancer cells, and GLCE-expressing LNCaP and PC3 cells were determined. Comparative analysis revealed the genes whose expression was changed in prostate cancer cells compared with normal PNT2 cells, and those differently expressed between the cancer cell lines (ACTA2, IL6, SERPINE1, TAGLN, SEMA3A, and CDH2). GLCE re-expression influenced mainly angiogenesis-involved genes (ANGPT1, SERPINE1, IGF1, PDGFB, TNF, IL8, TEK, IFNA1, and IFNB1) but in a cell type-specific manner (from basic deregulation of angiogenesis in LNCaP cells to significant activation in PC3 cells). Invasion/metastasis pathway was also affected (MMP1, MMP2, MMP9, S100A4, ITGA1, ITGB3, ERBB2, and FAS). The obtained results suggest activation of angiogenesis as a main molecular mechanism of pro-oncogenic effect of GLCE in prostate cancer.

Here we find that the expression level of miR-296-3p is much lower in the non-metastatic human prostate cancer (PCa) cell line P69 than that in the highly metastatic cell line M12, which is derived from P69. We demonstrate that miR-296-3p directly targets and inhibits the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) in the malignant M12. The data from clinical tissue microarrays also show that miR-296-3p is frequently upregulated and ICAM-1 is reversely downregulated in PCa. Interestingly, ectopic expression of miR-296-3p in P69 increases the tolerance to NK cells whereas knockdown of miR-296-3p in M12 reduces the resistance to NK cells, which both phenotypes can be rescued by re-expression or silencing of ICAM-1 in P69 and M12, respectively. These results are also manifested in vivo by the decrease in the incidence of pulmonary tumour metastasis exhibited by knockdown of miR-296-3p in M12 when injected into athymic nude mice via tail vein, and consistently down-expression of ICAM-1 reverses this to increase extravasation of CTCs into lungs.

Patients with limited nodal disease appeared to have a good chance of long-term survival, even without immediate adjuvant therapy (androgen deprivation therapy and/or radiotherapy). In this study we update the followup in these patients and verify the reported projected probability of survival.  Materials and methods:   The projected 10-year cancer specific survival probability after the initially reported followup of 3.2 years was 60% for these patients with node positive disease. The outcome has been updated after a median followup of 15.6 years.  Results:   Of the 39 patients with 1 positive node 7 (18%) remained biochemically relapse-free, 11 (28%) showed biochemical relapse only and 21 (54%) experienced clinical progression. Of these 39 patients 22 (57%) never required deferred androgen deprivation therapy and 12 (31%) died of prostate cancer. All patients with 2 (20) or more than 2 (29) positive nodes experienced biochemical relapse and only 5 (10%) of these 49 experienced no clinical progression. Of these 49 patients 39 (80%) received deferred androgen deprivation therapy.  Conclusions:   Biochemical relapse is likely in patients with limited nodal disease after radical prostatectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection, but for 46% of patients this does not imply death from prostate cancer.

The optimal method for such biopsy remains undefined, however.  Objective:   To prospectively compare targeted biopsy outcomes between MR imaging (MRI)-ultrasound fusion and visual targeting.  Design, setting, and participants:   From June 2012 to March 2013, prospective targeted biopsy was performed in 125 consecutive men with suspicious regions identified on prebiopsy 3-T MRI consisting of T2-weighted, diffusion-weighted, and dynamic-contrast enhanced sequences.  Intervention:   Two MRI-ultrasound fusion targeted cores per target were performed by one operator using the ei-Nav|Artemis system. Targets were then blinded, and a second operator took two visually targeted cores and a 12-core biopsy.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Biopsy information yield was compared between targeting techniques and to 12-core biopsy. Results were analyzed using the McNemar test. Multivariate analysis was performed using binomial logistic regression.  Results and limitations:   Among 172 targets, fusion biopsy detected 55 (32.0%) cancers and 35 (20.3%) Gleason sum ≥7 cancers compared with 46 (26.7%) and 26 (15.1%), respectively, using visual targeting (p=0.1374, p=0.0523). Fusion biopsy provided informative nonbenign histology in 77 targets compared with 60 by visual (p=0.0104). Targeted biopsy detected 75.0% of all clinically significant cancers and 86.4% of Gleason sum ≥7 cancers detected on standard biopsy. On multivariate analysis, fusion performed best among smaller targets. The study is limited by lack of comparison with whole-gland specimens and sample size. Furthermore, cancer detection on visual targeting is likely higher than in community settings, where experience with this technique may be limited.  Conclusions:   Fusion biopsy was more often histologically informative than visual targeting but did not increase cancer detection. A trend toward increased detection with fusion biopsy was observed across all study subsets, suggesting a need for a larger study size. Fusion targeting improved accuracy for smaller lesions.

A useful step for understanding their functional role is characterizing their influence on the protein context of the targets. Using miRNA context-specific influence as a functional signature is promising to identify functional associations between miRNAs and other gene signatures, and thus advance our understanding of miRNA mode of action.  Results:   In the current study we utilized the power of regularized regression models to construct functional associations between gene signatures. Genes that are influenced by miRNAs directly(computational miRNA target prediction) or indirectly (protein partners of direct targets) are defined as functional miRNA gene signature. The combined direct and indirect miRNA influence is defined as context-specific effects of miRNAs, and is used to identify regulatory effects of miRNAs on curated gene signatures. Elastic-net regression was used to build functional associations between context-specific effect of miRNAs and other gene signatures (disease, pathway signatures) by identifying miRNAs whose targets are enriched in gene lists. As a proof of concept, elastic-net regression was applied on lists of genes downregulated upon pre-miRNA transfection, and successfully identified the treated miRNA. This model was then extended to construct functional relationships between miRNAs and disease and pathway gene lists. Integrating context-specific effects of miRNAs on a protein network reveals more significant miRNA enrichment in prostate gene signatures compared to miRNA direct targets. The model identified novel list of miRNAs that are associated with prostate clinical variables.  Conclusions:   Elastic-net regression is used as a model to construct functional associations between miRNA signatures and other gene signatures. Defining miRNA context-specific functional gene signature by integrating the downstream effect of miRNAs demonstrates better performance compared to the miRNA signature alone (direct targets). miRNA functional signatures can greatly facilitate miRNA research to uncover new functional associations between miRNAs and diseases, drugs or pathways.""","""['Mohammed Alshalalfa', 'Reda Alhajj']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""BMC Bioinformatics""","""['Protein network-based Lasso regression model for the construction of disease-miRNA functional interactions.', 'A densely interconnected genome-wide network of microRNAs and oncogenic pathways revealed using gene expression signatures.', 'miTALOS: analyzing the tissue-specific regulation of signaling pathways by human and mouse microRNAs.', 'MicroRNAs as regulators of signal transduction in urological tumors.', 'Identifying miRNAs, targets and functions.', 'Identification and validation of differentially expressed genes for targeted therapy in NSCLC using integrated bioinformatics analysis.', 'SMMDA: Predicting miRNA-Disease Associations by Incorporating Multiple Similarity Profiles and a Novel Disease Representation.', 'A novel information diffusion method based on network consistency for identifying disease related microRNAs.', 'The role of microRNAs in COVID-19 with a focus on miR-200c.', 'GCAEMDA: Predicting miRNA-disease associations via graph convolutional autoencoder.']"""

To achieve the desired high throughput needed for most screening programs, automated quantification of 3D cultures is required. Towards this end, this paper reports on the development of a prototype analysis module for an automated high-content-analysis (HCA) system, which allows for accurate and fast investigation of in vitro 3D cell culture models for PCa. The Java based program, which we have named PCaAnalyser, uses novel algorithms that allow accurate and rapid quantitation of protein expression in 3D cell culture. As currently configured, the PCaAnalyser can quantify a range of biological parameters including: nuclei-count, nuclei-spheroid membership prediction, various function based classification of peripheral and non-peripheral areas to measure expression of biomarkers and protein constituents known to be associated with PCa progression, as well as defining segregate cellular-objects effectively for a range of signal-to-noise ratios. In addition, PCaAnalyser architecture is highly flexible, operating as a single independent analysis, as well as in batch mode; essential for High-Throughput-Screening (HTS). Utilising the PCaAnalyser, accurate and rapid analysis in an automated high throughput manner is provided, and reproducible analysis of the distribution and intensity of well-established markers associated with PCa progression in a range of metastatic PCa cell-lines (DU145 and PC3) in a 3D model demonstrated.""","""['Md Tamjidul Hoque', 'Louisa C E Windus', 'Carrie J Lovitt', 'Vicky M Avery']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['In-air production of 3D co-culture tumor spheroid hydrogels for expedited drug screening.', 'Epithelial-To-Mesenchymal Transition Markers and CD44 Isoforms Are Differently Expressed in 2D and 3D Cell Cultures of Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'An image-based assay to quantify changes in proliferation and viability upon drug treatment in 3D microenvironments.', 'High-throughput screening in multicellular spheroids for target discovery in the tumor microenvironment.', 'Getting the whole picture: High content screening using three-dimensional cellular model systems and whole animal assays.', 'TASI: A software tool for spatial-temporal quantification of tumor spheroid dynamics.', 'Three-dimensional cell culture: A powerful tool in tumor research and drug discovery.', 'Segmentation of Image Data from Complex Organotypic 3D Models of Cancer Tissues with Markov Random Fields.', 'Advanced cell culture techniques for cancer drug discovery.']"""

Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in miRNA may contribute to diverse functional consequences, including cancer development, by altering miRNA expression. Numerous studies have shown the association between miRNA SNPs and cancer risk; however, the results are generally debatable and inconclusive, mainly due to limited statistical power. To assess the relationship between the five most common SNPs (miR-146a rs2910164, miR-196a2 rs11614913, miR-499 rs3746444, miR-149 rs2292832, and miR-27a rs895919) and the risk cancer development, we performed a meta-analysis of 66 published case-control studies. Crude odds ratios at 95% confidence intervals were used to investigate the strength of the association. No association was observed between rs2910164 and cancer risk in the overall group. However, in stratified analysis, we found that either the rs2910164 C allele or the CC genotype was protective against bladder cancer, prostate cancer, cervical cancer, and colorectal cancer, whereas it was a risk factor for papillary thyroid carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). Further, rs11614913 was found to be significantly associated with decreased cancer risk, in particular, for bladder cancer, gastric cancer, and SCCHN. For miR-499, a significant association was found between the rs3746444 polymorphism and cancer risk in pooled analysis. In subgroup analysis, similar results were mainly observed for breast cancer. Finally, no association was found between rs2292832 and rs895919 polymorphisms and cancer risk in the overall group and in stratified analysis. In summary, miR-196a2 rs11614913, miR-146a rs2910164, and miR-499 rs3746444 are risk factors for cancer development, whereas mir-149 rs2292832 and miR-27a rs895919 are not associated with cancer risk.""","""['Xiao Pin Ma', 'Ting Zhang', 'Bo Peng', 'Long Yu', 'De Ke Jiang']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Comprehensive assessment of the association between miRNA polymorphisms and gastric cancer risk.', 'The association of miR-146a rs2910164 and miR-196a2 rs11614913 polymorphisms with cancer risk: a meta-analysis of 32 studies.', 'Five common functional polymorphisms in microRNAs (rs2910164, rs2292832, rs11614913, rs3746444, rs895819) and the susceptibility to breast cancer: evidence from 8361 cancer cases and 8504 controls.', 'The association between two common polymorphisms (miR-146a rs2910164 and miR-196a2 rs11614913) and susceptibility to gastric cancer: A meta-analysis.', 'Comprehensive review of genetic association studies and meta-analyses on miRNA polymorphisms and cancer risk.', 'The miR-196a SNP Rs11614913 but not the miR-499 rs37464444 SNP is a Risk Factor for Non-small Cell Lung Cancer in an Iranian Population.', 'Induced mammary cancer in rat models: pathogenesis, genetics, and relevance to female breast cancer.', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms in microRNA Genes and Colorectal Cancer Risk and Prognosis.', 'Deciphering the Variants Located in the MIR196A2, MIR146A, and MIR423 with Type-2 Diabetes Mellitus in Pakistani Population.', 'Polymorphisms in miRNA genes play roles in the initiation and development of cervical cancer.']"""

These are currently the subject of discussion in immunology, but completely unexplored in cancer biology. We set out to investigate the role of IL-30 in prostate carcinogenesis and its effects on human prostate cancer (hPCa) cells.  Experimental design:   IL-30 expression, as visualized by immunohistochemistry and real-time reverse transcriptase PCR on prostate and draining lymph nodes from 125 patients with prostate cancer, was correlated with clinicopathologic data. IL-30 regulation of hPCa cell viability and expression of selected gene clusters was tested by flow cytometry and PCR array.  Results:   IL-30, absent in normal prostatic epithelia, was expressed by cancerous epithelia with Gleason ≥ 7% of 21.3% of prostate cancer stage I to III and 40.9% of prostate cancer stage IV. IL-30 expression by tumor infiltrating leukocytes (T-ILK) was higher in stage IV that in stage I to III prostate cancer (P = 0.0006) or in control tissue (P = 0.0011). IL-30 expression in prostate draining lymph nodes (LN)-ILK was higher in stage IV than in stage I to III prostate cancer (P = 0.0031) or in control nodes (P = 0.0023). The main IL-30 sources were identified as CD68(+) macrophages, CD33(+)/CD11b(+) myeloid cells, and CD14(+) monocytes. In vitro, IL-30 stimulated proliferation of hPCa cells and also downregulated CCL16/LEC, TNFSF14/LIGHT, chemokine-like factor (CKLF), and particularly CKLF-like MARVEL transmembrane domain containing 3 (CMTM3) and greatly upregulated ChemR23/CMKLR.

Experimental design:   To gain potential insights into SRD5A biologic effects, we examined the relationship between SRD5A prognostic markers and endogenous sex-steroid levels measured by mass spectrometry in plasma samples and corresponding prostatic tissues of patients with prostate cancer.  Results:   We report that five of the seven SRD5A markers differentially affect sex-steroid profiles of dihydrotestosterone and its metabolites in both the circulation and prostatic tissues of patients with prostate cancer. Remarkably, a 32% increase in intraprostatic testosterone levels was observed in the presence of the high-risk SRD5A rs2208532 polymorphism. Moreover, SRD5A2 markers were associated predominantly with circulating levels of inactive glucuronides. Indeed, the rs12470143 SRD5A2 protective allele was associated with high circulating androstane-3α, 17β-diol-17-glucuronide (3α-diol-17G) levels as opposed to lower levels of both 3α-diol-17G and androsterone-glucuronide observed with the rs2208532 SRD5A2 risk allele. Moreover, SRD5A2 rs676033 and rs523349 (V89L) risk variants, in strong linkage disequilibrium, were associated with higher circulating levels of 3α-diol-3G. The SRD5A2 rs676033 variant further correlated with enhanced intraprostatic exposure to 5α-reduced steroids (dihydrotestosterone and its metabolite 3β-diol). Similarly, the SRD5A1 rs166050C risk variant was associated with greater prostatic exposure to androsterone, whereas no association was noted with circulating steroids.

Aberrant Stat5 activity was initially observed in leukemias, but subsequently also found in carcinomas. We investigated the importance of Stat5 in human tumor cell lines. shRNA mediated downregulation of Stat5 revealed the dependence of prostate and breast cancer cells on the expression of this transcription factor. We extended these inhibition studies and derived a peptide aptamer (PA) ligand, which directly interacts with the DNA-binding domain of Stat5 in a yeast-two-hybrid screen. The Stat5 specific PA sequence is embedded in a thioredoxin (hTRX) scaffold protein. The resulting recombinant protein S5-DBD-PA was expressed in bacteria, purified and introduced into tumor cells by protein transduction. Alternatively, S5-DBD-PA was expressed in the tumor cells after infection with a S5-DBD-PA encoding gene transfer vector.

Materials and methods:   We conducted a random-effects dose-response meta-analysis to assess the relationships between coffee consumption and nonaggressive, aggressive and fatal PCa risk. Studies were identified by a search of Medline and Embase databases to 15 July 2013. We carried out separate analyses by grade (Gleason score: low-grade, high-grade) and stage (TNM staging system: localized, advanced) of the tumors. Nonaggressive tumors were defined as low-grade or localized, while aggressive tumors were defined as high-grade or advanced.  Results:   Eight studies (three case-control and five cohort) were included in this meta-analysis. Gleason 7 tumors were classified as high-grade in one study, while in another study, Gleason 7(4 + 3) tumors were classified as high-grade and Gleason 7(3 + 4) as low-grade. In the remaining four studies, Gleason 7 tumors were excluded from the analyses or analyzed separately. The pooled relative risk (RR) for a consumption increment of 3 cups/day was 0.97 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.92-1.03] for low-grade PCa (n = 6), 0.97 (95% CI 0.94-0.99) for localized PCa (n = 6), 0.89 (95% CI 0.78-1.00) for high-grade PCa (n = 6), 0.95 (95% CI 0.85-1.06) for advanced PCa (n = 6) and 0.89 (95% CI 0.82-0.97) for fatal PCa (n = 4). No evidence of publication bias was observed. Heterogeneity was absent or marginal (I(2) range = 0-26%), with the only exception of the analysis on advanced PCa, where moderate heterogeneity was observed (I(2) = 60%). When restricting the analyses only to those studies that defined high-grade tumors as Gleason 8-10, the inverse association became slightly stronger [RR: 0.84 (95% CI 0.72-0.98); n = 4].  Conclusions:   Results from this dose-response meta-analysis suggest that coffee consumption may be inversely associated with the risk of fatal PCa.

Therefore, we examined the association between statin use and risk of PCa in a Denmark-based case-control study.  Materials and methods:   We identified 42,480 patients diagnosed with incident PCa during 1997-2010 from a national cancer registry. Five age-matched population controls (n=212,400) were selected for each case using risk-set sampling. Statin use from 1996 to the index date was obtained from the National Prescription Registry. Odds ratios (ORs) adjusted for age, comorbidity, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug use, and educational level for PCa associated with statin use, were computed using conditional logistic regression. Analyses were stratified by duration of statin use (0-1, 2-4, 5-9, or ≥10 years), stage of PCa (localized or advanced), and type of statin used (lipophilic or hydrophilic).  Results:   In total, 7915 patients (19%) and 39,384 controls (19%) redeemed statin prescriptions prior to the index date. Overall, statin users had a 6% lower risk of PCa compared with non-users [adjusted OR (ORa), 0.94; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.91-0.97]. Risk estimates did not differ substantially by duration or type of statin used. Slightly larger statin use-associated risk reductions were observed for advanced PCa (ORa, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.85-0.96) and with statin use ≥10 years (ORa, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.65-0.95).

Methods:   Data were obtained from a cohort of Aussiedler residing in the federal state of Saarland (n=18,619). Cancer incidence and vital status were ascertained through record linkage with the Saarland Cancer Registry and local population registries.  Results:   During the follow up period from 1990 to 2009 we observed 638 incident diagnoses of malignant neoplasms (except non-melanoma skin cancer). The overall standardized incidence ratio (SIR) was 0.98 (95% confidence interval 0.92, 1.04). However, site-specific SIRs revealed great variation. Stomach cancer incidence was significantly higher among Aussiedler. Lung cancer was elevated for males, but lower among females. Additionally, diagnoses for colorectal cancer among males were significantly lower. Age-standardized rates (ASRs) over time show not all cancer rates of Aussiedler attenuate as expected to Saarland rates. For example, lung and prostate cancer incidence rates show increasing disparity from Saarland rates and female breast cancer incidence develops in parallel. Furthermore, ASR for overall cancer incidence of Aussiedler shows a yearly decrease (p=0.06) whereas Saarland rates remain stable.

Patients and methods:   All patients considered for a radical prostatectomy for a clinically localised prostate cancer in our institution between June 2006 and April 2011 were analysed. They underwent a systematic endorectal 1.5 T MRI [eMRI] (T2 and diffusion-weighted imaging). The procedure was performed at least 8 weeks after transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsies. They were analyzed by a single experimented genitourinary radiologist. The preoperative characteristics and biopsy data were collected, as the eMRI interpretation using a systematic scale. Correlation between eMRI and final histopathology has been analyzed (standardized pathological report using the Stanford procedure). We considered the following points: extracapsular extension, seminal vesicle invasion and cancer localisation. Cancer localization was analyzed both by halves (left/right) and on sextant-basis (base, middle, apex, left and right respectively). For each data, sensitivity, specificity, positive (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated. Finally, we compared the results with those from the Partin's table and the Kattan's nomogram for T stage.  Results:   Two hundred and fifteen patients underwent a radical prostatectomy, having a mean age of 63 ± 6 years, a mean PSA: 7.8 ± 3.8 ng/mL. One hundred and fifty-nine patients had organ confined disease. Fifty-six had pT3 disease (50 pT3a and 6 pT3b). Sensibilities and specificities were the following: for extracapsular extension 26% and 96%; for seminal vesicle invasion 17% and 98%; for cancer localisation 64% and 74%; for prediction of left or right side 81% and 48%.  Discussion:   MRI showed equal performances compared to the Partin's table and the Kattan's nomogram for T stage. It showed lower performance compared to biopsy results for cancer localization (sensitivity 88%, specificity 70%). Literature provides wide ranges of results for eMRI. The results of this study were at the low limit of these ranges but reflect everyday practice. When performed, as it was in our study, eMRI did not seem to be accurate for staging.

This study was undertaken to delineate possible down-stream signaling pathways that are involved in this process. Intact IGFBP-3 and its N-terminal 1-97 fragments with or without a signal pro-peptide was fused to YFP and expressed in PC-3 human prostate cancer cells. In some cases, the putative IGF-binding site present in full length IGFBP-3 and its N-terminal fragment was also mutated. Extent of apoptosis was quantified using FACS. Up-regulation of total Stat-1 and activation of phospho-Stat-1 was shown by western blot. TGF-β signal was measured by luciferase reporter assay. Results from inhibitor studies indicated that both the Caspase 8 and caspase 9 pathways are involved in IGFBP-3 (non-secreted form) induced apoptosis in PC-3 cells. Exogenous addition of IGFBP-3 to PC-3 cells increased Stat-1 protein expression/tyrosine phosphorylation. Interestingly, results also showed that knockdown of Stat-1 by siRNA potentiated the IGFBP-3 induced apoptosis in PC-3 cells. In addition, both full-length IGFBP-3 and its 1-97 N-terminal fragments inhibited TGFβ signaling in these cells. This is the first report that compares the signal transduction pathways involved in apoptotic pathways mediated by IGFBP-3 in PC-3 human prostate cancer cells. Non-secreted form of full length IGFBP-3 and its N-terminal fragments induced apoptosis in PC-3 cells via activation of caspase 8 and caspase 9. We noted that both secreted and non-secreted forms of IGFBP-3 are involved in modulating Stat-1 and TGF-β pathways to induce apoptotic actions in PC-3 cells. Surprisingly, only non-secreted form of IGFBP-3 and its N-terminal fragments are involved in the induction of apoptosis in PC-3 cells via caspase 8 and caspase 9 activation.

Methods:   Form April 2010 to October 2011, 1611 healthy men undergoing routine physical examinations in our hospital were enrolled and received examinations with serum PSA test, digital rectal examination and transrectal ultrasound. The men with abnormalities in any two of the three examinations were referred to a prostate biopsy. The men with normal results in any two of the examinations or with a negative biopsy finding were defined as men without prostate cancer. Men with a prior history of prostate cancer/surgery or with urinary tract infection/obstruction were excluded.  Results:   A total of 1572 men without prostate cancer were finally included in this study and stratified into 5 age groups, namely 40 to 49, 50 to 59, 60 to 69, 70 to 79, and older than 80 years groups.

Immunohistochemistry for prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is commonly used for this purpose but can be of limited utility. Recently, prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) has been shown to be a promising marker for the identification of metastatic prostate carcinoma in surgical specimens. The utility of this marker has yet to be reported for cytology specimens. We sought to compare the sensitivities of PSMA and PSA immunohistochemistry and investigate the specificity of PSMA by utilizing cell block preparations from cytologic cases of metastatic prostate carcinoma (n = 19) and carcinomas of nonprostatic origin (n = 33). The sensitivity of PSMA immunohistochemistry was higher (16/19; 84%) in detecting metastatic prostate carcinomas than that of PSA immunohistochemistry (11/19; 58%). Strong, diffuse staining for PSMA was seen in 13 (81%) of 16 PSMA-positive cases whereas strong, diffuse staining for PSA was observed in six (55%) of 11 PSA-positive cases. Positivity for either PSMA or PSA was seen in 17 of 19 cases of metastatic prostate carcinoma for a combined sensitivity of 89%. PSMA immunohistochemistry was completely negative in 32 of 33 cytology cases of nonprostatic carcinomas. Therefore, the specificity of this marker was 97% in this study.

EAF2/U19 expression level is down-regulated in advanced human prostate cancer. EAF2/U19 is also a putative transcription factor with a transactivation domain and capability of sequence-specific DNA binding. Identification of binding partners and regulators of EAF2/U19 is essential to understand its function in regulating apoptosis/survival of prostate cancer cells.  Methods:   Through a yeast two-hybrid screening system, we identified Pirin as a binding partner of EAF2. We further determined the interaction between epitope-tagged EAF2/U19 and Pirin by co-immunoprecipitation in mammalian cells. The effect of Pirin on EAF2/U19 inhibition of LNCaP growth was assayed by colony formation.  Results:   Pirin co-immunoprecipitated with EAF2/U19 and the overexpressed Pirin decreased the expression level of EAF2/U19 protein in prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP and PC3. Furthermore, overexpression of EAF2/U19 suppressed LNCaP colony formation, and co-expression of Pirin significantly blocked the growth inhibition induced by EAF2/U19 overexpression.  Conclusion:   Pirin is a newly identified binding partner of EAF2/U19 capable of down-regulating EAF2/U19 protein and alleviating its inhibition of prostate cancer cell survival/proliferation.

In order to test this finding on a larger number of samples, prostate specimens were obtained from patients undergoing adenomectomy for BPH (n = 21), and as a control, from patients undergoing radical cystectomy for bladder cancer (prostates unchanged pathologically, n = 18).

Methods employed included: Human Obesity PCR Array (Qiagen), QPCR and Western blotting. QPCR studies confirmed significant overexpression of ZFP91 in BPH samples. On a protein level, however, comparison between normal and BPH prostates revealed insignificant differences. As for prostate cell lines examined, all expressed ZFP91 mRNA. Western blotting analysis showed markedly higher protein levels of ZFP91 in all cancer cell lines in comparison with normal (PrEC) cells.

Methods:   Two hundred and one patients who failed to achieve an undetectable PSA received SRT without ADT. The primary endpoint was failure to SRT that was defined by clinical progression or use of second-line ADT. Clinicopathological parameters, 6-week PSA level, PSAV and pre-SRT PSA levels were assessed using time-dependent analyses.  Results:   Median postoperative 6-week PSA and pre-SRT PSA levels were 0.25 and 0.48 ng/mL, respectively. Median time between surgery and SRT was 7 months. Failure to SRT was reported in 42.8 % of cases with the need for second-line ADT in 26.9 % of cases. Pre-SRT PSA was strongly correlated with postoperative 6-week PSA (p < 0.001) but not with PSAV. The risk of SRT failure was increased by threefold in case of Gleason score 8-10 (p = 0.036) or pT3b cancer (p = 0.006). Risk group classification based on these prognostic factors improved SRT failure prediction. Survival curves confirmed that 5-year ADT-free survival rates were significantly influenced by PSAV (p = 0.002) and pre-SRT PSA (p = 0.030).  Conclusions:   In patients with persistently detectable PSA after RP and selected for local salvage treatment, SRT offers good oncologic clinical outcomes. The most powerful pathologic predictive factors of SRT failure include a pT3b stage, a Gleason score 8 or more cancer and high PSAV and pre-SRT PSA levels. Patients having a high PSAV >0.04 ng/mL/mo would be potentially better candidates for a systemic therapy due to a high SRT failure rate.""","""['Guillaume Ploussard', 'Frédéric Staerman', 'Jean Pierrevelcin', 'Sébastien Larue', 'Arnauld Villers', 'Adil Ouzzane', 'Cyrille Bastide', 'Nicolas Gaschignard', 'François Buge', 'Christian Pfister', 'Romain Bonniol', 'Xavier Rebillard', 'Saad Fadli', 'Nicolas Mottet', 'Fabien Saint', 'Rodrigue Saad', 'Jean-Baptiste Beauval', 'Morgan Roupret', 'François Audenet', 'Mickaël Peyromaure', 'Nicolas Barry Delongchamps', 'Sébastien Vincendeau', 'Tarek Fardoun', 'Jérôme Rigaud', 'Michel Soulie', 'Laurent Salomon;Committee of Cancerology (CCAFU) of the Association of French Urology (AFU)']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""World J Urol""","""['Use of Concomitant Androgen Deprivation Therapy in Patients Treated with Early Salvage Radiotherapy for Biochemical Recurrence After Radical Prostatectomy: Long-term Results from a Large, Multi-institutional Series.', 'Achieving an undetectable PSA after radiotherapy for biochemical progression after radical prostatectomy is an independent predictor of biochemical outcome--results of a retrospective study.', 'Improved biochemical outcome with adjuvant radiotherapy after radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer with poor pathologic features.', 'Use of androgen deprivation and salvage radiation therapy for patients with prostate cancer and biochemical recurrence after prostatectomy.', 'The timing of salvage radiotherapy after radical prostatectomy: a systematic review.', 'Stereotactic Radiotherapy after Radical Prostatectomy in Patients with Prostate Cancer in the Adjuvant or Salvage Setting: A Systematic Review.', 'Detectable Prostate-specific antigen value between 0.01 and 0.1\xa0ng/ml following robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP): does it correlate with future biochemical recurrence?', 'Saudi Oncology Society and Saudi Urology Association combined clinical management guidelines for prostate cancer 2017.', 'Optimal timing of salvage radiotherapy for biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy: is ultra-early salvage radiotherapy beneficial?', 'Saudi oncology society and Saudi urology association combined clinical management guidelines for prostate cancer.']"""

The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of total tumor volume measured by HS (TVHS) in patients with PCa.  Methods:   In 148 patients with proven PCa, TVHS was measured prior to radical prostatectomy and compared with the total tumor volume in the final pathological report (TVP) using the rank-based spearman correlation test. Correlation was performed after stratification of the results by d'Amico risk categories, prostate volume, experience of HS examiner, distance of the ultrasound probe to the prostate (≤3.5 and >3.5 mm) and quality of initial HS. In addition, a re-analysis of HS data was performed by a single examiner and the TVHS from the unmodified HS data was acquired.  Results:   TVP was approximately twofold higher compared to TVHS. Overall, there was no significant correlation (r s = -0.0083, p = 0.9) for the TVP and the TVHS. After adjusting for d'Amico risk categories, prostate volume, experience of examiner, distance of the ultrasound probe to the prostate and quality of initial HS, no significant correlation was found. After re-analyzing of all HS data by 1 examiner, the correlation remained not significant (r s = 0.039, p = 0.6).  Conclusions:   TVHS and TVP did not correlate in this cohort of patients. We cannot recommend the use of HS at least for imaging of the total tumor volume at this time.

Low PSA concentrations in seminal plasma (SP) have been associated with low sperm motility. To evaluate whether KLK2 and KLK3 genetic variants affect physiological prostatic secretion, we studied the association of SNPs with hK2 and PSA concentrations in SP and serum of young, healthy men.  Methods:   Leukocyte DNA was extracted from 303 male military conscripts (median age 18.1 years). Nine SNPs across KLK2-KLK3 were genotyped. We measured PSA and hK2 in SP and serum using immunofluorometric assays. The association of genotype frequencies with hK2 and PSA concentrations was tested with the Kruskal-Wallis test.  Results:   Four KLK2 SNPs (rs198972, rs198977, rs198978, and rs80050017) were strongly associated with hK2 concentrations in SP and serum, with individuals homozygous for the major alleles having 3- to 7-fold higher concentrations than the intermediate concentrations found in other homozygotes and heterozygotes (all P < 0.001). Three of these SNPs were significantly associated with percentage of free PSA (%fPSA) in serum (all P < 0.007).

Methods:   Evidence-based online databases were searched for studies reporting the performance of DWI and DCE in PCa detection in the same patient cohorts using histopathology as reference standard and providing sufficient data to construct 2 × 2 contingency tables. Pooled estimates of diagnostic performance were computed across included studies.  Results:   Of 80 initial studies identified, 5 studies (total of 265 patients and 1730 prostatic regions) met criteria for inclusion in the meta-analysis. Pooled sensitivity was 58.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 53.5%-63.1%) for DWI and 55.3% (95% CI, 50.4%-60.1%) for DCE. Pooled specificity was 89.0% (95% CI, 87.2%-0.7%) for DWI and 87.9% (95% CI, 86.0%-89.6%) for DCE. At summary receiver-operating-characteristic analysis, area-under-the-curve was 0.810 (0.059) for DWI and 0.786 (0.079) for DCE.

These results were extended in the present study by analyzing the redox state of the protein thioredoxin 1 (Trx1) and sulfinylation (SO3) of peroxiredoxins (Prxs) (PrxSO3) in PCa tissues and cell lines. Lysates of paired human PCa tissues with varying degrees of aggressiveness and adjacent benign (BN) tissues were used for analysis. Redox Western blot analysis of Trx1 demonstrated low levels of reduced and high levels of oxidized Trx1 (functional and nonfunctional, respectively) in high-grade PCa (Gleason scores 4+4 to 4+5) in comparison to intermediate-grade PCa (Gleason scores 3+3 to 3+4) or BN tissues. PrxSO3 were increased in high-grade PCa. Oxidized Trx1 and PrxSO3 are indicators of oxidative stress. To study whether redox imbalance may potentially affect enzyme activities of antioxidant proteins (APs), we determined the levels of selected APs in PCa tissues by Western blot analysis and found that mitochondrial manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), Prx3, and Trx1 were increased in high-grade PCa tissues compared with BN tissues. Enzyme activities of MnSOD in high-grade PCa tissues were significantly increased but at a lower magnitude compared with the levels of MnSOD protein (0.5-fold vs 2-fold increase). Trx1 activity was not changed in high-grade PCa tissues despite a large increase in Trx1 protein expression. Further studies demonstrated a significant increase in posttranslational modifications of tyrosine and lysine residues in MnSOD protein and oxidation of Cys at the active site (Cys32 and Cys35) and the regulatory site (Cys62 and Cys69) of Trx1 in high-grade PCa compared to BN tissues. These discordant changes between protein levels and enzyme activities are consistent with protein inactivation by redox imbalance and/or posttranslational modifications. In contrast, the protein level and activity of extracellular superoxide dismutase were significantly decreased in high-grade PCa compared with adjacent BN tissues. Results from cell lines mirror those from PCa tissues.

Methods and materials:   T2-weighted, diffusion-weighted, and dynamic-contrast-enhanced MRI were acquired the day before treatment and analyzed retrospectively for 15 patients. Twelve patients had hormone therapy before the MRI scan. The tumor was delineated on MRI by a radiologist and registered to treatment planning transrectal ultrasound images. A margin based on analysis of delineation and registration uncertainties was applied to create a focal boost planning target volume (F-PTV). Delivered treatment plans were compared with focal boost plans optimized to increase F-PTV dose as much as allowed by urethral and rectal dose constraints.  Results:   Tumors were delineated in all patients with volumes 0.4-23.0cc. The margin for tumor delineation and image registration uncertainties was estimated to be 4.5 mm. For F-PTV, the focal boost treatment plans increased median D90 from 17.6 to 20.9 Gy and median V150 from 27.3% to 75.9%.

Novel functional polymorphisms of the UGT2B17 and UGT2B15 genes have been recently characterized by in vitro assays but have not been evaluated in epidemiologic studies.  Methods:   Fifteen functional SNPs of the UGT2B17 and UGT2B15 genes, including cis-acting UGT2B gene SNPs, were genotyped in African American and Caucasian men (233 PC cases and 342 controls). Regression models were used to analyze the association between SNPs and PC risk.  Results:   After adjusting for race, age and BMI, we found that six UGT2B15 SNPs (rs4148269, rs3100, rs9994887, rs13112099, rs7686914 and rs7696472) were associated with an increased risk of PC in log-additive models (p < 0.05). A SNP cis-acting on UGT2B17 and UGT2B15 expression (rs17147338) was also associated with increased risk of prostate cancer (OR = 1.65, 95% CI = 1.00-2.70); while a stronger association among men with high Gleason sum was observed for SNPs rs4148269 and rs3100.  Conclusions:   Although small sample size limits inference, we report novel associations between UGT2B15 and UGT2B17 variants and PC risk. These associations with PC risk in men with high Gleason sum, more frequently found in African American men, support the relevance of genetic differences in the androgen metabolism pathway, which could explain, in part, the high incidence of PC among African American men.

A number of studies have demonstrated that bufalin can induce apoptosis in some cancers. However, effects and mechanism of bufalin on prostate cancer cells remain unknown.  Methods:   Apoptosis assay was measured by the annexin-V/PI flow cytometric assay. Western blot was used to measure Caspase-3 and Bcl-2. qRT-PCR was used to measure the relative expression of miR-181a.  Results:   Bufalin was found to induce the expression of miR-181a, a small non-coding RNA believed to induce apoptosis by repressing its target gene, BCL-2. In prostate cancer PC-3cell line, bufalin-induced apoptosis can be largely attenuated by a miR-181a inhibitor, which blocked bufalin-induced Bcl-2 reduction and caspase-3 activation.

Standard 12-core TRUSBx under peri-prostatic block (10 mL of 1% lidocaine) and antibiotic prophylaxis (oral ciprofloxacin, intravenous gentamicin and metronidazole suppository) were performed.

In this study, we analyzed the diagnostic value of the expression of the pepsinogen C (PGC) and prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) genes in tissue samples obtained from prostate biopsies.  Materials and methods:   This study was comprised of 51 consecutive patients who underwent transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided prostate biopsies between January 2010 and March 2010. The biopsies were performed with 12 cores, and an additional core was randomly retrieved from the peripheral zone from each patient for study purposes. The expression of the PGC and PSMA genes was analyzed from the cDNA from the samples via the qRT-PCR technology. The expression patterns of patients with PCa were compared with those of patients without a PCa diagnosis.  Results:   PSMA was overexpressed in only 43.4% of PCa cases, and PGC was overexpressed in 72.7% of cases. The median expression of PSMA was 1.5 times (0.1 to 43.9) and the median PGC expression was 8.7 times (0.1 to 50.0) the expression observed in prostatic tissue from TRUS-guided biopsies of normal patients. Analysis of patients with high-risk PCa indicated that PGC was overexpressed in 71.4% of cases (with a median expression of 10.6 times), and PSMA was overexpressed in only 35.7% of cases (with a median expression of 4.5 times). Among patients with low-risk PCa, PGC was also overexpressed in 71.4% of cases (with a median expression of 5.9 times), and PSMA was overexpressed in only 42.8% of cases (with a median expression of 2.5 times).

Materials and methods:   The biological response of a prostate cancer target volume under conditions where a sub-volume of the target volume was not directly irradiated was modelled in terms of surviving fraction (SF) and Poisson-based TCP. A direct comparison was made between the linear-quadratic (LQ) response model, and a response model that incorporates bystander effects as derived from published in vitro data by McMahon et al. in 2012 and 2013. Scenarios of random and systematic misses were considered.  Results:   Our results suggested the potential for the bystander effect to deviate from LQ predictions when even very small (< 1%) sub-volumes of the target volume were directly irradiated. Under conditions of random misses for each fraction, the bystander model predicts a 3% and 1% improvement in tumour control compared to that predicted by an LQ model when only 90% and 95% of the prostate cells randomly receive the intended dose. Under conditions of systematic miss, if even a small portion of the target volume is not directly exposed, the LQ model predicts a TCP approaching zero, whereas the bystander model suggests TCP will improve starting at exposed volumes of around 85%.  Conclusions:   The bystander model, when applied to clinically relevant scenarios, demonstrates the potential to deviate from the TCP predictions of the common local LQ model when sub-volumes of a target volume are randomly or systematically missed over a course of fractionated radiation therapy.""","""['Michael John Balderson', 'Charles Kirkby']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Biol""","""['Potential implications of the bystander effect on TCP and EUD when considering target volume dose heterogeneity.', 'Dose-volume conundrum for response of prostate cancer to brachytherapy: summary dosimetric measures and their relationship to tumor control probability.', 'A computational model of cellular response to modulated radiation fields.', 'Does a local bystander effect necessitate a revision of TCP models that are based on observed clinical data?', 'MIRD continuing education: Bystander and low dose-rate effects: are these relevant to radionuclide therapy?', 'The Radiobiology of Radiopharmaceuticals.', 'Modelling responses to spatially fractionated radiation fields using preclinical image-guided radiotherapy.']"""

Recently, a tumor suppressor function for the lipid phosphatase inositol polyphosphate 4-phosphatase type II (INPP4B) has been described in breast and prostate cancers, with impact on PI3K signaling output. Given the importance of PI3K pathway activity for melanoma formation and growth, we aimed to assess the role of INPP4B in melanocytic tumors. Our studies in native tumors suggest that decreased INPP4B expression is an event correlating with tumor progression in melanocytic neoplasms. We further demonstrate that INPP4B regulates PI3K/Akt signaling and exerts a tumor suppressor effect, impacting the proliferative, invasive, and tumorigenic capacity of melanoma cells.

A recent study showed that Pao extract repressed androgen-dependent LNCaP prostate cancer cell growth. We hypothesize that Pao extract asserts its anticancer effects on metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) cells. Pao extract suppressed CRPC PC3 cell growth in a dose- and time-dependent manner, through induction of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. Pao extract treatment induced cell cycle inhibitors, p21 and p27, and repressed PCNA, Cyclin A and Cyclin D1. Furthermore, Pao extract also induced the upregulation of pro-apoptotic Bax, reduction of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and XIAP expression, which were associated with the cleavage of PARP protein. Moreover, Pao extract treatment blocked PC3 cell migration and invasion. Mechanistically, Pao extract suppressed phosphorylation levels of AKT and NFκB/p65, NFκB DNA binding activity, and luciferase reporter activity. Pao inhibited TNFα-induced relocation of NFκB/p65 to the nucleus, NFκB/p65 transcription activity, and MMP9 activity as shown by zymography. Consistently, NFκB/p65 downstream targets involved in proliferation (Cyclin D1), survival (Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and XIAP), and metastasis (VEGFa, MMP9, and GROα/CXCL1) were also downregulated by Pao extract. Finally, forced expression of NFκB/p65 reversed the growth inhibitory effect of Pao extract. Overall, Pao extract induced cell growth arrest, apoptosis, partially through inhibiting NFκB activation in prostate cancer cells. These data suggest that Pao extract may be beneficial for protection against CRPC.""","""['Cunjie Chang', 'Wei Zhao', 'Bingxian Xie', 'Yongming Deng', 'Tao Han', 'Yangyan Cui', 'Yundong Dai', 'Zhen Zhang', 'Jimin Gao', 'Hongqian Guo', 'Jun Yan']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Integr Cancer Ther""","""['Pao Pereira extract suppresses benign prostatic hyperplasia by inhibiting inflammation-associated NFκB signaling.', 'beta-carboline alkaloid-enriched extract from the amazonian rain forest tree pao pereira suppresses prostate cancer cells.', 'The plant extract of Pao pereira potentiates carboplatin effects against ovarian cancer.', 'NFkappaB-dependent chemoresistance in solid tumors.', 'Cucurbitacins as inducers of cell death and a rich source of potential anticancer compounds.', 'Alkaloid from Geissospermum sericeum Benth. & Hook.f. ex Miers (Apocynaceae) Induce Apoptosis by Caspase Pathway in Human Gastric Cancer Cells.', 'Targeting Inflammatory Signaling in Prostate Cancer Castration Resistance.', 'Pao Pereira extract suppresses benign prostatic hyperplasia by inhibiting inflammation-associated NFκB signaling.', 'Pao Pereira Extract Attenuates Testosterone-Induced Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia in Rats by inhibiting 5α-Reductase.', 'Combination chemotherapy with Zyflamend reduced the acquired resistance of bladder cancer cells to cisplatin through inhibiting NFκB signaling pathway.']"""

Histological request forms were analysed for clinical bio-data, type of biopsies and diagnosis.  Results:   A total of 908 prostatic tumours comprising of 468 open prostatectomies, 378 transurethral prostatectomies, 60 needle biopsies and 2 unspecified biopsy types were diagnosed. The peak age incidence of prostatic tumours was 60-69 years accounting for 37% of all prostatic tumours. Nodular prostatic hyperplasia (NPH) was the most common tumour accounting for 74.9%. Prostatic cancer was the second most common tumour accounting for 22.1% of all prostatic tumours. Six cases (1.3%) of incidental carcinoma were diagnosed out of the 680 cases of NPH. Transitional cell carcinoma and metastatic carcinoma constituted 0.2%, 0.1% of prostatic tumours respectively. In all, carcinosarcoma and fibrosarcoma accounted for 0.1% each of the prostatic tumours. High grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasm accounted for 0.2% while 1.1% was inadequate for histopathological diagnosis.

Methods:   Sample consists of patients (n = 128) and six subgroups of health-care professionals (urologists, n = 32; nurses, n = 95; radiotherapy technologists (RTTs), n = 36; medical oncologists, n = 19; radiation oncologists, n = 12; general practitioners (GPs), n = 10). Information needs have been assessed with 92 questions concerning prostate cancer and its treatment. Respondents judged the importance of addressing each question. Within- and between-group agreements of patients and health-care professional groups were estimated with raw agreement indices as well as chance-corrected Kappa and Gwet's AC1 measures. Finally, group-specific core items rated with high importance as well as high agreement were defined.  Results:   Patients rated on average (median) half, i.e., 51 out 92 items as essential (interquartile range (IQR) = 36-66), 26 items as desired (IQR = 14-38), and 10 items as avoidable (IQR = 2-22).

Agreement between patients and professionals is low too (AC1 = 0.282-0.329). Defining group-specific core sets of information topics results in 51 items being part of at least one core set. Concordance of the item core sets of patients and professionals is moderate with κ = 0.38-0.66, sensitivity of professionals' core sets for patients' preferences varies between 56 and 74%.

Objective:   To determine whether high-volume experienced open surgeons can improve their functional and oncologic outcomes with RARP and, if so, how many cases are required to surpass ORP outcomes and reach the learning curve plateau.  Design, setting, and participants:   A prospective observational study compared two surgical techniques: 1552 consecutive men underwent RARP (866) or ORP (686) at a single Australian hospital from 2006 to 2012, by one surgeon with 3000 prior ORPs.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Demographic and clinicopathologic data were collected prospectively. The Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite quality of life (QoL) questionnaire was administered at baseline, 1.5, 3, 6, 12, and 24 mo. Multivariate linear and logistic regression modelled the difference in QoL domains and positive surgical margin (PSM) odds ratio (OR), respectively, against case number.  Results and limitations:   A total of 1511 men were included in the PSM and 609 in the QoL analysis. RARP sexual function scores surpassed ORP scores after 99 RARPs and increased to a mean difference at 861st case of 11.0 points (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.9-16.1), plateauing around 600-700 RARPs. Early urinary incontinence scores for RARP surpassed ORP after 182 RARPs and increased to a mean difference of 8.4 points (95% CI, 2.1-14.7), plateauing around 700-800 RARPs. The odds of a pT2 PSM were initially higher for RARP but became lower after 108 RARPs and were 55% lower (OR: 0.45; 95% CI, 0.22-0.92) by the 866th RARP. The odds of a pT3/4 PSM were initially higher for RARP but decreased, plateauing around 200-300 RARPs with an OR of 1.15 (0.68-1.95) at the 866th RARP. Limitations include single-surgeon data and residual confounding.  Conclusions:   RARP had a long learning curve with inferior outcomes initially, and then showed progressively superior sexual, early urinary, and pT2 PSM outcomes and similar pT3 PSM and late urinary outcomes. Learning RARP was worthwhile for this high-volume surgeon, but the learning curve may not be justifiable for late-career/low-volume surgeons; further studies are needed.""","""['James E Thompson', 'Sam Egger', 'Maret Böhm', 'Anne-Maree Haynes', 'Jayne Matthews', 'Krishan Rasiah', 'Phillip D Stricker']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['What are the implications of the surgical learning curve?', 'Re: James E.

A new protocol for target prediction and functional analysis is presented and applied to the 26 highly differentially deregulated miRNAs in hepatocellular carcinoma. This framework comprises: (1) the overlap of prediction results by four out of five target prediction tools, including TargetScan, PicTar, miRanda, DIANA-microT and miRDB (combining machine-learning, alignment, interaction energy and statistical tests in order to minimize false positives), (2) evidence from previous microarray analysis on the expression of these targets, (3) gene ontology (GO) and pathway enrichment analysis of the miRNA targets and their pathways and (4) linking these results to oncogenesis and cancer hallmarks. This yielded new insights into the roles of miRNAs in cancer hallmarks. Here we presented several key targets and hundreds of new targets that are significantly enriched in many new cancer-related hallmarks. In addition, we also revealed some known and new oncogenic pathways for liver cancer. These included the famous MAPK, TGFβ and cell cycle pathways. New insights were also provided into Wnt signaling, prostate cancer, axon guidance and oocyte meiosis pathways. These signaling and developmental pathways crosstalk to regulate stem cell transformation and implicate a role of miRNAs in hepatic stem cell deregulation and cancer development. By analyzing their complete interactome, we proposed new categorization for some of these miRNAs as either tumor-suppressors or oncomiRs with dual roles. Therefore some of these miRNAs may be addressed as therapeutic targets or used as therapeutic agents. Such dual roles thus expand the view of miRNAs as active maintainers of cellular homeostasis.""","""['Mahmoud ElHefnawi', 'Bangli Soliman', 'Nourhan Abu-Shahba', 'Marwa Amer']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Genomics Proteomics Bioinformatics""","""['Identification and interaction analysis of key genes and microRNAs in hepatocellular carcinoma by bioinformatics analysis.', 'Comprehensive analysis of microRNA-regulated protein interaction network reveals the tumor suppressive role of microRNA-149 in human hepatocellular carcinoma via targeting AKT-mTOR pathway.', 'Bioinformatics functional analysis of let-7a, miR-34a, and miR-199a/b reveals novel insights into immune system pathways and cancer hallmarks for hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'Oncomirs miRNA-221/222 and Tumor Suppressors miRNA-199a/195 Are Crucial miRNAs in Liver Cancer: A Systematic Analysis.', 'Role of microRNAs in the main molecular pathways of hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'In Silico Analysis of MicroRNA Expression Data in Liver Cancer.', 'Potential miRNA Use as a Biomarker: From Breast Cancer Diagnosis to Metastasis.', ""In Silico and In Vivo Evaluation of microRNA-181c-5p's Role in Hepatocellular Carcinoma."", 'Copy number variation is highly correlated with differential gene expression: a pan-cancer study.', 'Co-regulatory Network of Oncosuppressor miRNAs and Transcription Factors for Pathology of Human Hepatic Cancer Stem Cells (HCSC).']"""

Materials and methods:   A total of 120 patients with cT1-4N0-3 bladder cancer were treated with prostate sparing cystectomy between 1994 and 2013, of whom 110 had a followup of 2 years or greater and were eligible for analysis. To rule out tumor in the bladder neck, prostatic urethra or prostate cancer all patients underwent preoperative transurethral biopsy of the bladder neck and prostatic urethra, prostate specific antigen measurement and transrectal ultrasound with biopsies. We assessed oncologic outcomes (disease specific and recurrence-free survival), recurrence rates, prostate cancer and functional results (continence, voiding, and erectile and ejaculatory function).  Results:   Mean patient ± SD age was 56.2 ± 8.3 years and median followup was 77.0 months (IQR 57-116). Two and 5-year disease specific survival rates were 76.2% and 66.5%, 2 and 5-year recurrence-free survival rates were 71.2% and 66.6%, and distant and local recurrence rates were 34.2% and 10.0%, respectively. One local recurrence was in the remnant prostatic urothelium. Prostate cancer was diagnosed in 2.7% of cases.

Methods:   Between 2005 and 2012, 214 men accepted AS on the basis of favorable clinical features and parameters after initial and repeat biopsy. Failure was defined as increase in Gleason score >6, total positive cores >33%, maximum cancer volume in any core >50%, or a prostate-specific antigen >10 ng/mL. Disease progression and overall AS failure were compared between the 2 groups.  Results:   Of 214 men, 75 were excluded, leaving 67 AAM and 72 non-AAM on AS. Median age at diagnosis was 64 and 67 years for AAM and non-AAM, respectively, and median follow-up was 34 and 46 months, respectively. During this time, 44 AAM (66%) remained on AS, and 23 (34%) underwent treatment, of whom 6 (26%) were treated by patient choice and 17 (74%) because of disease progression. In the non-AAM group, 59 (82%) men remained on AS, and 13 (18%) underwent treatment, 8 (62%) were treated by patient choice and 5 (38%) because of disease progression.

Their pathogenesis and etiology remain to be elucidated although their migration from the intracranial space has been suggested. The authors postulated that if migration plays a major role, patients with intracranial SDH may harbor asymptomatic lumbar SDH. The authors performed a prospective study on the incidence of spinal SDH in patients with intracranial SDH to determine whether migration is a key factor in their concomitance.  Methods:   The authors evaluated lumbar MR images obtained in 168 patients (125 males, 43 females, mean age 75.6 years) with intracranial chronic SDH to identify cases of concomitant lumbar SDH. In all cases, the lumbar MRI studies were performed within the 1st week after surgical irrigation of the intracranial SDH.  Results:   Of the 168 patients, 2 (1.2%) harbored a concomitant lumbar SDH; both had a history of trauma to both the head and the hip and/or lumbar area. One was an 83-year-old man with prostate cancer and myelodysplastic syndrome who suffered trauma to his head and lumbar area in a fall from his bed. The other was a 70-year-old man who had hit his head and lumbar area in a fall. Neither patient manifested neurological deficits and their hematomas disappeared under observation. None of the patients with concomitant lumbar SDH had sustained head trauma only, indicating that trauma to the hip or lumbar region is significantly related to the concomitance of SDH (p < 0.05).  Conclusions:   As the incidence of concomitant lumbar and intracranial chronic SDH is rare and both patients in this study had sustained a direct impact to the head and hips, the authors suggest that the major mechanism underlying their concomitant SDH was double trauma.

The results of 3-(4,5-dimethythiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assays revealed that cell viability decreased in a dose- and time-dependent manner in response to acacetin. 4',6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining revealed that chromatin condensation significantly increased in a dose-dependent manner. Flow cytometric analysis indicated that acacetin suppressed the viability of DU145 cells by inducing apoptosis. Western blot anlaysis of various markers of signaling pathways revealed that acacetin targets the Akt and nuclear factor (NF)-κB signaling pathways by inhibiting the phosphorylation of IκBα and NF-κB in a dose-dependent manner. Consistent with its ability to induce apoptosis, the acacetin-mediated inhibition of the pro-survival pathway, Akt, and of the NF-κB pathway was accompanied by a marked reduction in the levels of the NF-κB‑regulated anti-apoptotic proteins, Bcl-2 and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), as well as of the proliferative protein, cyclooxygenase (COX)-2. We further evaluated the effects of acacetin on prostate cancer using mice subcutaneously injected with DU145 prostate cancer cells. The acacetin-treated nude mice bearing DU145 tumor xenografts exhibited significantly reduced tumor size and weight, due to the effects of acacetin on cancer cell apoptosis, as determined by terminal deoxyribonucleotide transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL) assay. Our findings suggest that acacetin exerts antitumor effects by targeting the Akt/NF-κB signaling pathway. Rurther investigations on this flavonoid are warranted to evaluate its potential use in the prevention and therapy of prostate cancer.""","""['Hye Ri Kim', 'Chan Gi Park', 'Ji Youn Jung']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Int J Mol Med""","""['Eriocalyxin B induces apoptosis in lymphoma cells through multiple cellular signaling pathways.', 'Huang-lian-jie-du-tang, a traditional Chinese medicine prescription, induces cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis in human liver cancer cells in vitro and in vivo.', 'Carnosic acid modulates Akt/IKK/NF-κB signaling by PP2A and induces intrinsic and extrinsic pathway mediated apoptosis in human prostate carcinoma PC-3 cells.', 'Molecular approaches toward targeted cancer prevention with some food plants and their products: inflammatory and other signal pathways.', 'Novel approaches to target NF-κB and other signaling pathways in cancer stem cells.', 'Acacetin-loaded microemulsion for transdermal delivery: preparation, optimization and evaluation.', 'Comparative analysis of the medicinal and nutritional components of different varieties of Pueraria thomsonii and Pueraria lobata.', 'Flavones: Six Selected Flavones and Their Related Signaling Pathways That Induce Apoptosis in Cancer.', 'Qingfei Jiedu decoction inhibits PD-L1 expression in lung adenocarcinoma based on network pharmacology analysis, molecular docking and experimental verification.', 'Acacetin Inhibits Cell Proliferation and Induces Apoptosis in Human Hepatocellular Carcinoma Cell Lines.']"""

This root, commonly found in Yunnan province, is used in traditional Chinese medicine as an antipyretic, analgesic and diaphoretic agent. A number of studies have reported that agents isolated from a species of Umbelliferae (Apiaceae) have antitumor activities. We previously reported, using combined treatments with this medicinal herb and hyperthermia at various temperatures, an enhanced cytotoxicity in the human prostate cancer androgen‑independent cell lines, PC3 and DU145, and analyzed the related mechanisms. In the present study, we investigated the effects of treatment with SA prior to hyperthermia on the thermosensitivity of DU145 cells, and the mechanisms related to the induction of apoptosis and G(2)/M cell cycle arrest via the activation of extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways, as well as the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathways. Cells were exposed to hyperthermia alone (40-44˚C) or hyperthermia in combination with SA. Lethal damage to cells treated with mild hyperthermia (40 or 42˚C) for up to 6 h was slight; however, hyperthermia in combination with SA synergistically enhanced thermosensivity. Lethal damage to cells treated with acute hyperthermia (43 or 44˚C) was more severe, but these effects were also enhanced and were more significant by the combined treatment with SA. The kinetics of apoptosis induction and cell cycle distribution were analyzed by flow cytometry. In addition, the levels of ERK1/2, JNK and Akt were determined by western blot analysis. The incidence of apoptotic cells after treatment with SA (20.0 µM) at 37˚C for 4 h, hyperthermia (44˚C) alone for 30 min, and the combination in sequence were examined. The sub-G1 division (%) in the diagram obtained by flow cytometry was applied to that assay. The percentage of apoptotic cells (10.53±5.02%) was higher at 48 h as compared to 0, 12 and 24 h after treatment. The distribution of DU145 cells in the G2/M cell cycle phase was markedly increased after 24 h of heating at 44˚C and after the combined treatment with heating and SA. The phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was reduced following treatment with heating and SA, while the levels of phosphorylated JNK (p-JNK) were markedly increased immediately after heating at 44˚C and when heating was combined with SA. By contrast, the levels of phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt) were immediately increased only after heating at 44˚C. Thus, we concluded that SA exerts its thermosensitizing effects on DU145 cells by inhibiting the activation of the MAPK/ERK1/2 and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways.""","""['Masanori Hatashita', 'Masahiko Taniguchi', 'Kimiye Baba', 'Ken Koshiba', 'Takefumi Sato', 'Yutaka Jujo', 'Ryuta Suzuki', 'Sachiko Hayashi']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Int J Mol Med""","""['Thermosensitization and induction of apoptosis or cell-cycle arrest via the MAPK cascade by parthenolide, an NF-κB inhibitor, in human prostate cancer androgen-independent cell lines.', 'Shikonin inhibits prostate cancer cells metastasis by reducing matrix metalloproteinase-2/-9 expression via AKT/mTOR and ROS/ERK1/2 pathways.', 'Antimitogenic and proapoptotic activities of methylseleninic acid in vascular endothelial cells and associated effects on PI3K-AKT, ERK, JNK and p38 MAPK signaling.', 'The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt and c-Jun N-terminal kinase signaling in cancer: Alliance or contradiction?

Critically short telomeres are thought to contribute to cancer development by increasing chromosomal instability. We hypothesized that shorter leukocyte telomere length, a surrogate for inherited prostate cell telomere length, would be associated with increased risk of prostate cancer in hereditary prostate cancer (HPC) families.  Methods:   One hundred twelve affected and 63 unaffected men from 28 families were drawn from the Johns Hopkins HPC family database. Relative mean telomere length was measured in isolated peripheral leukocyte DNA by quantitative PCR. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate the association between quartile of age-adjusted telomere length and prostate cancer.  Results:   Men in the shortest quartile of telomere length did not have increased odds of prostate cancer compared to men in the other three quartiles (OR = 0.84, 95% CI: 0.32-2.20, P = 0.73). However, when the analysis was restricted to affected men with blood drawn before or within a year of diagnosis (N = 39) and all unaffected men, shorter telomere length was moderately associated with increased odds of prostate cancer (OR = 3.55, 95% CI: 0.82-15.43, P = 0.09).

Pudendal nerve entrapment typically occurs when the pudendal nerve is fused to nearby anatomical structures or trapped between the sacrotuberous and sacrospinalis ligaments. Pudendal nerve entrapment can be caused by excessive bicycling, pregnancy, anatomic abnormalities, scarring due to surgery, or as a sequela of radiation therapy. Radiation-induced peripheral neuropathy is usually chronic, progressive, and often irreversible. Radiation-induced pudendal neuropathy is much less common than the more familiar brachial plexopathy secondary to radiation treatment for breast cancer. The prevalence of PNE, however, is increasing due to improved long-term cancer survival. Diagnosis of pudendal neuralgia is essentially clinical; no specific clinical signs or complementary tests are reliably confirmatory. A detailed pain history with correlative clinical examination is paramount for accurate diagnosis. Performance of a pudendal nerve block can serve as both a diagnostic and therapeutic tool. Utilization of various imaging studies, as well as the performance of an electrophysiological study with pudendal nerve motor latency testing, may yield valuable evidence in support of a pudendal neuralgia diagnosis. We present the case of a 59-year-old man with stage IV prostate cancer, referred to the pain clinic for chronic perineal and right sided pelvic pain. His pain began insidiously, approximately 2 months after undergoing radiation treatment and chemotherapy 3 years prior. He was ultimately diagnosed as having a right sided pudendal entrapment neuropathy. His pain was refractory to all conventional treatment modalities; therefore we decided to pursue neuromodulation via a dorsal column spinal cord stimulator implant.

Methods:   The accumulation of ALA-induced PpIX in PC-3 cells was observed by fluorescence microscopy and measured by flow cytometry analysis. The efficiency of ALA-PDT was analyzed by flow cytometry and assessed by cell death, caspase-3 activity and mitochondrial membrane potential.

Results:   ALA-induced PpIX accumulation increased in time- and ALA concentration-dependent manners.

Most geographic misses occurred in the upper prostate bed in the anterior-posterior plane. The median prostate bed tilt was 1.8° (range -23.4° to 42.3°).  Conclusions:   Variability was seen in all planes for the movement of both surgical clips. The greatest movement occurred in the anterior-posterior plane in the upper prostate bed, which could cause geographic miss of treatment delivery. The variability in the movement of the superior and inferior clips indicates a prostate bed tilt that would be difficult to correct with standard online matching techniques. This creates a strong argument for using anisotropic planning target volume margins in post-prostatectomy radiotherapy.""","""['Linda J Bell', 'Jennifer Cox', 'Thomas Eade', 'Marianne Rinks', 'Andrew Kneebone']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Med Imaging Radiat Oncol""","""['The impact of rectal and bladder variability on target coverage during post-prostatectomy intensity modulated radiotherapy.', 'Determining optimal planning target volume and image guidance policy for post-prostatectomy intensity modulated radiotherapy.', 'The importance of prostate bed tilt during postprostatectomy intensity-modulated radiotherapy.', 'Clinical to planning target volume margins in prostate cancer radiotherapy.', 'A multicentre observational study evaluating image-guided radiotherapy for more accurate partial-breast intensity-modulated radiotherapy: comparison with standard imaging technique.', 'Interfractional Geometric Variations and Dosimetric Benefits of Stereotactic MRI Guided Online Adaptive Radiotherapy (SMART) of Prostate Bed after Radical Prostatectomy: Post-Hoc Analysis of a Phase II Trial.', 'Intra-fraction displacement of the prostate bed during post-prostatectomy radiotherapy.', 'Salvage radiation therapy in prostate cancer: relationship between rectal dose and long-term, self-reported rectal bleeding.', 'Dosimetric Impact of Interfractional Variations for Post-prostatectomy Radiotherapy to the Prostatic Fossa-Relevance for the Frequency of Position Verification Imaging and Treatment Adaptation.', 'Implementing daily soft tissue image guidance with reduced margins for post-prostatectomy radiotherapy: research-based changes to clinical practice.']"""

GRP78 is also present on the cell surface membrane of trophoblastic cells, where it is associated with invasive or fusion properties of these cells. Impaired mechanism of GRP78 relocation from ER to the cell surface was observed in preeclamptic cytotrophoblastic cells (CTB) and could take part in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia. In this study, we have investigated whether prostate apoptosis response 4 (Par-4), a protein identified as a partner of GRP78 relocation to the cell surface in prostate cancer cells, is present in trophoblastic cells and is involved in the translocation of GRP78 to the cell surface of CTB. Par-4 is indeed present in trophoblastic cells and its expression correlates with expression of membrane GRP78. Moreover, overexpression of Par-4 led to an increase of cell surface expression of GRP78 and decreased Par-4 gene expression reduced cell surface localization of GRP78 confirming a role of Par-4 in relocation of GRP78 from ER to the cell surface. Accordingly, invasive property was modified in these cells. In conclusion, we show that Par-4 is expressed in trophoblastic cells and is involved in transport of GRP78 to the cell surface and thus regulates invasive property of extravillous CTB.""","""['Marie Cohen', 'Pascale Ribaux', 'Manuella Epiney', 'Olivier Irion']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Novel mechanism of apoptosis resistance in cancer mediated by extracellular PAR-4.', 'The Par-4-GRP78 TRAIL, more twists and turns.', 'Involvement of membrane GRP78 in trophoblastic cell fusion.', 'GRP78: a chaperone with diverse roles beyond the endoplasmic reticulum.', 'Glucose-regulated protein (GRP78) is an important cell surface receptor for viral invasion, cancers, and neurological disorders.', 'The therapeutic mavericks: Potent immunomodulating chaperones capable of treating human diseases.', 'Curcumin Sensitizes 4T1 Murine Breast Cancer Cells to Cisplatin Through PAR4 Secretion.', 'An Endogenous Retroviral LTR-Derived Long Noncoding RNA lnc-LTR5B Interacts With BiP to Modulate ALV-J Replication in Chicken Cells.', 'New Insights into Cancer Targeted Therapy: Nodal and Cripto-1 as Attractive Candidates.', 'Interaction of Pregnancy-Specific Glycoprotein 1 With Integrin Α5β1 Is a Modulator of Extravillous Trophoblast Functions.']"""

Tumors contain features of acinar-type adenocarcinoma with elevated eIF4E-driven protein translation and squamous cell carcinoma marked by activated beta-catenin. Lentiviral integration site analysis revealed that alternative histological phenotypes can be clonally derived from a common cell of origin. In advanced disease, adenocarcinoma can be propagated by self-renewing tumor cells with an androgen receptor-low immature luminal phenotype in the absence of basal-like cells.

Our aim was to evaluate the roles of the biopsy Gleason score, prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-based parameters, volume, and clinical T classification in prediction of ECE.  Materials and methods:   A total of 188 patients with clinically organ-confined prostate cancer who underwent radical prostatectomy from January 1998 to December 2007 were included in the study. Age, prostate volume, preoperative total serum PSA (tPSA), free PSA, PSA density (PSAD), biopsy Gleason score, and clinical T classification were analyzed by univariate and multivariate analyses to predict ECE.  Results:   Pathologic examination revealed 130 patients had organ-confined disease and 58 patients were positive for ECE. Multivariate logistic regression analyses showed that tPSA was an independent predictor of ECE. Gleason score ≥8 had a trend for predicting ECE. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves suggested that tPSA and PSAD had a similar diagnosis performance in the whole cohort. For patients with Gleason score of 7, PSAD was found to be statistically better than tPSA for predicting ECE.  Conclusions:   tPSA remains one of the most important factors for predicting ECE in prostate cancer patients.

A patterned cell system was developed by combining the cell-repellent properties of polyvinyl alcohol hydrogels with the cell adhesive properties of self-assembled films of dopamine (polydopamine). It was shown that polydopamine could be patterned onto spin-cast polyvinyl alcohol hydrogels by microcontact printing, which in turn effectively patterned the growth of several cell types (HeLa, human embryonic kidney, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and prostate cancer). The cells could be patterned in geometries down to single-cell confinement, and it was demonstrated that cell patterns could be maintained for at least 3 weeks. Furthermore, polydopamine could be used to modify poly(vinyl alcohol) in situ using a cell-compatible deposition buffer (1 mg mL(-1) dopamine in 25 mM tris with a physiological salt balance). The treatment switched the PVA hydrogel from cell repellent to cell adhesive. Finally, by combining microcontact printing and in situ deposition of polydopamine, patterned co-cultures of the same cell type (HeLa/HeLa) and dissimilar cell types (HeLa/HUVEC) were realized through simple chemistry and could be studied over time.

In this study, we evaluated the expression patterns and functional significance of SOCS2 in PCa. Protein expression analysis employing tissue microarrays from two independent patient cohorts revealed a significantly enhanced expression in tumor tissue compared with benign tissue as well as association with Gleason score and disease progression. In vitro and in vivo assays uncovered the involvement of SOCS2 in the regulation of cell growth and apoptosis. Functionally, SOCS2 knockdown inhibited PCa cell proliferation and xenograft growth in a CAM assay. Decreased cell growth after SOCS2 downregulation was associated with cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis. In addition, we proved that SOCS2 expression is significantly elevated upon androgenic stimulation in androgen receptor (AR)-positive cell lines, providing a possible mechanistic explanation for high SOCS2 levels in PCa tissue.

To investigate prognostic factors of the outcome of SRT and to analyze which patient subsets benefit most from dose escalation.  Materials and methods:   Between 2002 and 2008, 76 patients were treated in three different dose-groups: an earlier cohort treated with 66 Gy irrespective of pre-RT-characteristics and two later cohorts treated with 70 Gy or 75 Gy depending on pre-RT-characteristics. Biochemical-relapse-free-survival (bRFS), clinical-relapse-free-survival (cRFS) and late toxicity were evaluated.  Results:   Four-year bRFS and cRFS were 62.5% and 85%. Gleason score <8, positive surgical resection margin (PSRM) and low PSA (≤0.5 ng/ml) before SRT resulted in higher bRFS. Analysis of the whole group showed no clear dose-outcome relationship. Patients with PSRM, however, had improved bRFS when escalating >66 Gy. While > 70 Gy did not improve the overall results, 4-year bRFS for patients with manifest local recurrence in the high-dose group was still comparable to those without manifest local recurrences. No grade 4 and minimal grade 3 gastrointestinal and urinary toxicity were observed.  Conclusions:   Dose-escalated SRT achieves high biochemical control. The data strongly support the application of at least 70 Gy rather than 66 Gy.
