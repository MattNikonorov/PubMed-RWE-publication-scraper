The predictive value of ERG gene fusion in HGPIN for PCa was interrogated as a post hoc analysis in the context of a randomized clinical trial.  Patients and methods:   The GTx Protocol G300104 randomly assigned 1,590 men with biopsy-diagnosed HGPIN to receive toremifene or placebo for 3 years or until a diagnosis of PCa was made on prostate biopsy. As part of this phase III clinical trial, a central pathologist evaluated biopsies of patients with isolated HGPIN at baseline and 12, 24, and 36 months of follow-up. ERG immunohistochemistry was performed on biopsies from 461 patients and evaluated for protein overexpression.  Results:   ERG expression was detected in 11.1% of patients (51 of 461 patients) with isolated HGPIN. In the first year and during the 3-year clinical trial, 14.7% and 36.9% of 461 patients were diagnosed with PCa, respectively. Patients with ERG expression were more likely to develop PCa, with 27 (53%) of 51 ERG-positive and 143 (35%) of 410 ERG-negative patients experiencing progression to PCa (P = .014, Fisher's exact test). ERG expression was not associated with age, baseline PSA, Gleason score, or tumor volume.  Conclusion:   This study underscores the necessity of more stringent follow-up for men with HGPIN that is also positive for ERG overexpression. Clinicians should consider molecular characterization of HGPIN as a means to improve risk stratification.""","""['Kyung Park', 'James T Dalton', 'Ramesh Narayanan', 'Christopher E Barbieri', 'Michael L Hancock', 'David G Bostwick', 'Mitchell S Steiner', 'Mark A Rubin']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Clin Oncol""","""['ERG overexpression and multifocality predict prostate cancer in subsequent biopsy for patients with high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia.', 'Expression of ERG protein, a prostate cancer specific marker, in high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN): lack of utility to stratify cancer risks associated with HGPIN.', 'Prostate cancer diagnosis among men with isolated high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia enrolled onto a 3-year prospective phase III clinical trial of oral toremifene.', 'Clinical applications of novel ERG immunohistochemistry in prostate cancer diagnosis and management.', 'The prognostic and predictive value of TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion and ERG protein expression in prostate cancer biopsies.', 'Prognostic value of E‑26 transformation‑specific‑related gene in prostate cancer based on immunohistochemistry analysis.', 'Prospective evaluation of the role of imaging techniques and TMPRSS2:ERG mutation for the diagnosis of clinically significant prostate cancer.', 'Race and prostate cancer: genomic landscape.', 'Tadalafil and Steroid Hormones Interactions in Adipose, Bone and Prostate Tissues: Focus on Translational Perspectives.', 'Past, Current, and Future Strategies to Target ERG Fusion-Positive Prostate Cancer.']"""

Curcumin exhibits growth-suppressive activity against several cancers, including prostate cancer, but it has poor bioavailability. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the anticancer potency and mechanism of a curcumin analogue, 1,5-bis(3-hydroxyphenyl)-1,4-pentadiene-3-one (Ca 37), in human prostate cancer. Studies were performed in established human prostate cancer cell lines (PC-3 and DU145) as well as in a murine xenograft tumor (PC-3) model. Ca 37 presented a preferential suppression capacity against growth and migration toward prostate cancer cells compared with curcumin. Ca 37 impaired the bioenergetics system, promoted cell cycle arrest and apoptosis activation in PC-3 cells. In addition, 0.5 μmol (6.65 mg/kg body weight) of Ca 37 significantly inhibited the growth of the prostate xenografted tumors, whereas 6 μmol (110 mg/kg body weight) of curcumin had little effect. Furthermore, a combination of Ca 37 and curcumin resulted in enhanced antitumor activity in prostate cancer cells. N-Acetylcysteine abrogated both reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and viability loss induced by Ca 37 but partially prevented growth inhibition in PC-3 cells treated with curcumin alone, or a combination with Ca 37. The data indicate that induction of ROS plays a vital role in the growth inhibitory effect of Ca 37 in PC-3 cells. This study suggests that Ca 37, alone or in combination with curcumin, may be a promising anticancer agent for prostate cancer therapy.""","""['Cheng Luo', 'Yan Li', 'Bo Zhou', 'Liang Yang', 'Hua Li', 'Zhihui Feng', 'Yuan Li', 'Jiangang Long', 'Jiankang Liu']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Apoptosis""","""['Combined inhibitory effects of curcumin and phenethyl isothiocyanate on the growth of human PC-3 prostate xenografts in immunodeficient mice.', 'Curcumin-targeting pericellular serine protease matriptase role in suppression of prostate cancer cell invasion, tumor growth, and metastasis.', 'T63, a new 4-arylidene curcumin analogue, induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis through activation of the reactive oxygen species-FOXO3a pathway in lung cancer cells.', 'Curcumin-based anti-prostate cancer agents.', 'Curcumin against Prostate Cancer: Current Evidence.', 'Targeting Mitochondrial OXPHOS and Their Regulatory Signals in Prostate Cancers.', 'Diarylpentanoid (1,5-bis(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-1,4-pentadiene-3-one) (MS13) Exhibits Anti-proliferative, Apoptosis Induction and Anti-migration Properties on Androgen-independent Human Prostate Cancer by Targeting Cell Cycle-Apoptosis and PI3K Signalling Pathways.', 'Free Radicals as a Double-Edged Sword: The Cancer Preventive and Therapeutic Roles of Curcumin.', 'Pterospermum acerifolium (L.) wild bark extract induces anticarcinogenic effect in human cancer cells through mitochondrial-mediated ROS generation.', 'Comparative analysis of protective effects of curcumin, curcumin-β-cyclodextrin nanoparticle and nanoliposomal curcumin on unsymmetrical dimethyl hydrazine poisoning in mice.']"""

Methods:   Between June 2010 and May 2012, CT, DWI and [(11)C]choline PET/CT were performed preoperatively in 33 intermediate- and high-risk PCa patients undergoing radical prostatectomy (RP) and extended pelvic lymph node dissection (ePLND) including obturator fossa and internal, external and common iliac fields. Patient- and field-based performance characteristics for all three imaging techniques based on histopathological results are reported. Imaging techniques were compared by means of the area under the curve (AUC).  Results:   LN metastases were detected in 92 of 1,012 (9%) LNs from 14 of 33 (42%) patients. On patient-based analysis, sensitivity, specificity and accuracy for CT were 57, 68 and 64%, respectively, for DWI were 57, 79 and 70%, respectively, and for [(11)C]choline PET/CT were 57, 90 and 76%, respectively.

Patient's demographic and clinical information were obtained from the Florida Cancer Data System. Comorbidity was computed following the Elixhauser Index method. Census-tract-level socioeconomic status and farm house presence were extracted from Census 2000 and linked to patient data. The ratio of urologists and radiation oncologists to prostate cancer cases at the county level was computed. Multilevel logistic regression was conducted to identify significance of individuals and contextual factors in relation to overall mortality. A total of 18,042 patients were identified, among whom 2,363 died. No racial difference was found in our study. Being older at diagnosis, unmarried, current smoker, uninsured, diagnosed at late stage, with undifferentiated, poorly differentiated, or unknown tumor grade were significantly associated with higher odds of overall mortality. Living in a low-income area was significantly associated with higher odds of mortality (p = .0404). After adjusting for age, stage, and tumor grade, patients who received hormonal, combination of radiation with hormone therapy, and no definitive treatment had higher odds of mortality compared with those who underwent surgery only. A large number of comorbidities were associated with higher odds of mortality.

To understand their functions in prostate, we established a transgenic mouse model (AR3Tg) with targeted expression of the constitutively active and androgen-independent AR splice variant AR3 (a.k.a. AR-V7) in prostate epithelium. We found that overexpression of AR3 modulates expression of a number of tumor-promoting autocrine/paracrine growth factors (including Tgfβ2 and Igf1) and expands prostatic progenitor cell population, leading to development of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia. In addition, we showed that some epithelial-mesenchymal transition-associated genes are up-regulated in AR3Tg prostates, suggesting that AR3 may antagonize AR activity and halt the differentiation process driven by AR and androgen. This notion is supported by our observations that the number of Ck5(+)/Ck8(+) intermediate cells is increased in AR3Tg prostates after castration, and expression of AR3 transgene in these intermediate cells compromises prostate epithelium regeneration upon androgen replacement.

The limited results so far may be caused by the complex and contradictory effects of angiogenesis on perfusion. Alternatively, assessment of ultrasound contrast agent dispersion kinetics, resulting from features such as density and tortuosity, has shown a promising potential to characterize angiogenic effects on the microvascular structure. This method, referred to as contrast-ultrasound dispersion imaging (CUDI), is based on contrast-enhanced ultrasound imaging after an intravenous contrast agent bolus injection. In this paper, we propose a new spatiotemporal correlation analysis to perform CUDI. We provide the rationale for indirect estimation of local dispersion by deriving the analytical relation between dispersion and the correlation coefficient among neighboring time-intensity curves obtained at each pixel. This robust analysis is inherently normalized and does not require curve-fitting. In a preliminary validation of the method for localization of prostate cancer, the results of this analysis show superior cancer localization performance (receiver operating characteristic curve area of 0.89) compared with those of previously reported CUDI implementations and perfusion estimation methods.""","""['Maarten P J Kuenen', 'Tamerlan A Saidov', 'Hessel Wijkstra', 'Jean J M C H de la Rosette', 'Massimo Mischi']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""IEEE Trans Ultrason Ferroelectr Freq Control""","""['Angiogenesis imaging by spatiotemporal analysis of ultrasound contrast agent dispersion kinetics.', 'Contrast-ultrasound dispersion imaging for prostate cancer localization by improved spatiotemporal similarity analysis.', 'Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound Angiogenesis Imaging by Mutual Information Analysis for Prostate Cancer Localization.', 'Contrast ultrasound assessment of angiogenesis by perfusion and molecular imaging.', 'Mathematical Models of Contrast Transport Kinetics for Cancer Diagnostic Imaging: A Review.', 'Advanced ultrasound in the diagnosis of prostate cancer.', 'Contrast-enhanced ultrasound with dispersion analysis for the localization of prostate cancer: correlation with radical prostatectomy specimens.', 'Automated multiparametric localization of prostate cancer based on B-mode, shear-wave elastography, and contrast-enhanced ultrasound radiomics.', 'On the Relationship between Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound Parameters and the Underlying Vascular Architecture Extracted from Acoustic Angiography.', 'Multiparametric ultrasound: evaluation of greyscale, shear wave elastography and contrast-enhanced ultrasound for prostate cancer detection and localization in correlation to radical prostatectomy specimens.']"""

Culturing LNCaP cells in androgen‑depleted (AD) medium increased the levels of IL-6 and survivin, and treatment of the cells in AD medium with a combination of atorvastatin and celecoxib strongly inhibited the increase in IL-6 and survivin which is one of the downstream targets of the IL-6 signaling pathway. Addition of recombinant IL-6 partially abrogated the combined effect of atorvastatin and celecoxib on apoptosis in LNCaP cells cultured in AD medium. In SCID mice, we found that the levels of IL-6 and survivin expression were increased when LNCaP tumors became androgen-independent. Treatment of the mice with atorvastatin or celecoxib alone caused decrease in the levels of IL-6 and survivin as LNCaP tumors became androgen-independent, but treatment of the mice with a combination of celecoxib and atorvastatin resulted in a much stronger inhibition in the increase in IL-6 and survivin expression. Our results indicate that decreases in IL-6 and survivin levels by atorvastatin and celecoxib administration are associated with increased apoptosis in LNCaP cells treated with this drug combination.

In vitro systems typically lack complex cellular interactions among structured prostatic epithelia and a stromal microenvironment, and genetic and molecular fidelity are concerns in both in vitro and in vivo models. 'Tissue slice cultures' (TSCs) provide realistic preclinical models of diverse tissues and organs, but have not been fully developed or widely utilized for prostate studies. Problems encountered include degeneration of differentiated secretory cells, basal cell hyperplasia, and poor survival of PCa. Here, we optimized, characterized, and applied a TSC model of primary human PCa and benign prostate tissue that overcomes many deficiencies of current in vitro models. Tissue cores from fresh prostatectomy specimens were precision-cut at 300 μm and incubated in a rotary culture apparatus. The ability of varied culture conditions to faithfully maintain benign and cancer cell and tissue structure and function over time was evaluated by immunohistological and biochemical assays. After optimization of the culture system, molecular and cellular responses to androgen ablation and to piperlongumine (PL), purported to specifically reduce androgen signaling in PCa, were investigated. Optimized culture conditions successfully maintained the structural and functional fidelity of both benign and PCa TSCs for 5 days. TSCs exhibited androgen dependence, appropriately undergoing ductal degeneration, reduced proliferation, and decreased prostate-specific antigen expression upon androgen ablation. Further, TSCs revealed cancer-specific reduction of androgen receptor and increased apoptosis upon treatment with PL, validating data from cell lines. We demonstrate a TSC model that authentically recapitulates the structural, cellular, and genetic characteristics of the benign and malignant human prostate, androgen dependence of the native tissue, and cancer-specific response to a potentially new therapeutic for PCa.

Results:   Among AIANs who enrolled in Medicaid during the year following their cancer diagnosis, approximately 32% enrolled >1 month following diagnosis.

The goal of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic value of adiponectin multimers for prostate cancer.  Methods:   Total adiponectin, high- and low-molecular-weight (HMW, LMW), ratios of these measures, and body mass index (BMI) were compared in a prospective prostate cancer-screened cohort. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess the association between adiponectin measures, their interaction with BMI, and risk of prostate cancer and Gleason score upgrading from biopsy to prostatectomy.  Results:   A total of 228 prostate cancer cases and 239 controls were analyzed: 72 (31.6%) of the cancer cases were high grade (Gleason grade ≥7). Only percent HMW had a statistically significant relationship with prostate cancer (P = 0.04). Among normal and overweight men, the risk of prostate cancer increased as percent HMW increased [OR = 1.24 for a doubling of percent HMW, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.41-3.75 and OR = 1.81; 95% CI, 1.02-3.20, respectively], whereas among obese men, the risk of prostate cancer decreased (OR = 0.62; 95% CI, 0.32-1.18). Among 97 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy, there was no association between Gleason score upgrading and any of the adiponectin multimers.  Conclusion:   This study was unable to confirm the utility of total adiponectin as a biomarker for prostate cancer risk. For the adiponectin multimers, only HMW showed increases with prostate cancer but not in all weight classes.  Impact:   Although adiponectin may play a role in the pathogenesis of prostate cancer, our results do not support adiponectin multimers as biomarkers of detection.""","""['Edward A Medina', 'Xiaoyu Shi', 'Marcia H Grayson', 'Donna P Ankerst', 'Carolina B Livi', 'Maria V Medina', 'Ian M Thompson Jr', 'Robin J Leach']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev""","""['Obesity, adipokines, and prostate cancer in a prospective population-based study.', 'Adiponectin multimeric forms but not total adiponectin levels are associated with myocardial infarction in non-diabetic men.', 'Multiple Tissue Biomarkers Independently and Additively Predict Prostate Cancer Pathology Outcomes.', 'Maternal serum adiponectin multimers in gestational diabetes.', 'Association between serum adiponectin, and pathological stage and grade in men undergoing radical prostatectomy.', 'Circulating adiponectin and leptin and risk of overall and aggressive prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Role of Adiponectin in prostate cancer.', 'Clinical and biochemical markers of visceral adipose tissue activity: Body mass index, visceral adiposity index, leptin, adiponectin, and matrix metalloproteinase-3.

Results:   Six patients were identified from our institutions' internal cancer registry. Three out of these patients had been treated with laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (LRP). In addition to peritoneal metastases, other metastatic sites were mainly visceral. Only 1 patient developed bone metastases. Peritoneal carcinomatosis occurred mainly in patients with a high Gleason (= or >6) score since 5 out of our 6 patients had a Gleason score ≥7. All 6 patients were treated with docetaxel-based chemotherapy when they developed castration resistance. Five patients benefitted from chemotherapy according to their PSA or RECIST responses.

Estramustine may trigger suicidal death of cancer cells. Side effects of estramustine include anemia. At least in theory, estramustine could cause anemia by stimulation of eryptosis, the suicidal death of erythrocytes. Hallmarks of eryptosis include cell shrinkage, increased cytosolic Ca2+ activity ([Ca2+]), ceramide formation and phosphatidylserine translocation to the outer leaflet of the cell membrane with phosphatidylserine exposure at the erythrocyte surface. Eryptosis is stimulated by increase of cytosolic Ca2+ activity ([Ca2+]i). The present study explored whether estramustine triggers eryptosis.  Methods:   [Ca2+]i was estimated from Fluo3 fluorescence, cell volume from forward scatter, phosphatidylserine exposure from annexin V binding, and hemolysis from hemoglobin release.  Results:   A 24 h exposure to estramustine (≤ 100 μM) significantly increased [Ca2+]i, increased annexin V binding and increased hemoglobin release. The effect of estramustine on annexin V binding was significantly blunted by removal of extracellular Ca2+.  Conclusions:   Estramustine stimulates both, eryptosis and hemolysis.

Growth factor pathways including the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling have been implicated in the development of NE features and progression to a castration-resistant phenotype. However, upstream molecules that regulate the growth factor pathway remain largely unknown. Using androgen-insensitive bone metastasis PC-3 cells and androgen-sensitive lymph node metastasis LNCaP cells derived from human prostate cancer (PCa) patients, we demonstrated that γ-aminobutyric acid A receptor (GABA(A)R) ligand (GABA) and agonist (isoguvacine) stimulate cell proliferation, enhance EGF family members expression, and activate EGFR and a downstream signaling molecule, Src, in both PC-3 and LNCaP cells. Inclusion of a GABA(A)R antagonist, picrotoxin, or an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor, Gefitinib (ZD1839 or Iressa), blocked isoguvacine and GABA-stimulated cell growth, trans-phospohorylation of EGFR, and tyrosyl phosphorylation of Src in both PCa cell lines. Spatial distributions of GABAAR α₁ and phosphorylated Src (Tyr416) were studied in human prostate tissues by immunohistochemistry. In contrast to extremely low or absence of GABA(A)R α₁-positive immunoreactivity in normal prostate epithelium, elevated GABA(A)R α₁ immunoreactivity was detected in prostate carcinomatous glands. Similarly, immunoreactivity of phospho-Src (Tyr416) was specifically localized and limited to the nucleoli of all invasive prostate carcinoma cells, but negative in normal tissues. Strong GABAAR α₁ immunoreactivity was spatially adjacent to the neoplastic glands where strong phospho-Src (Tyr416)-positive immunoreactivity was demonstrated, but not in adjacent to normal glands. These results suggest that the GABA signaling is linked to the EGFR pathway and may work through autocrine or paracine mechanism to promote CRPC progression.""","""['Weijuan Wu', 'Qing Yang', 'Kar-Ming Fung', 'Mitchell R Humphreys', 'Lacy S Brame', 'Amy Cao', 'Yu-Ting Fang', 'Pin-Tsen Shih', 'Bradley P Kropp', 'Hsueh-Kung Lin']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Mol Cell Endocrinol""","""['Expression of gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor (subtype A) in prostate cancer.', 'Transition from androgenic to neurosteroidal action of 5α-androstane-3α, 17β-diol through the type A γ-aminobutyric acid receptor in prostate cancer progression.', 'Steroid receptor regulation of epidermal growth factor signaling through Src in breast and prostate cancer cells: steroid antagonist action.', 'Epidermal growth factor-related peptides and the epidermal growth factor receptor in normal and malignant prostate.', 'Oncogenic activation of androgen receptor.', 'GABAergic signaling beyond synapses: an emerging target for cancer therapy.', 'miR-31-3p functions as a tumor suppressor by directly targeting GABBR2 in prostate cancer.', 'Propofol enhances stem-like properties of glioma via GABAAR-dependent Src modulation of ZDHHC5-EZH2 palmitoylation mechanism.', 'KIF15 Promotes Progression of Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer by Activating EGFR Signaling Pathway.', 'Therapeutically leveraging GABAA receptors in cancer.']"""

Methods and materials:   Sixty-nine consecutive patients treated with salvage brachytherapy after a local failure were analyzed. All patients were found to have pathologic proven recurrent prostate cancer at least 2 years after initial therapy and no regional or distant disease on imaging studies. Pd-103 was used with a prescribed pD90 of 100 Gy. In total, 89.9% of patients received androgen suppression (AS) as part of their salvage therapy. Patients whose prostate-specific antigen >5.0 ng/mL while on AS were considered to have castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Patients on AS >6 months before salvage brachytherapy were considered to have delayed therapy. Patients retreated within 5 years after their initial treatment were considered to have early failures.  Results:   Total median followup after salvage therapy was 5.0 years (0.6-13.7). From the date of salvage, 5-year biochemical control for low-risk patients was 85.6%, intermediate-risk patients 74.8%, and high-risk patients 66%. Five-year biochemical control was 73.8% for non-CRPC and 22% for CRPC cases (<0.001).

Overexpression of Id-1 in tumor cells correlates with increased malignancy and resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Id-1B is an isoform generated by alternative splicing that differs from the classical Id-1 in the 13-C-terminal amino acids, whose function is at present unknown. We have studied the role of Id-1B in cancer and its expression in healthy/malignant lung tissues. Overexpression of Id-1B in A549 lung and PC3 prostate cancer cells reduced anchorage-dependent and independent proliferation and clonogenic potential. Moreover, it increased the proportion of cells in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle and p27 levels, while reduced phospho-Erk and cyclin A levels. Through microarray analysis, we identified genes involved in cell growth and proliferation that are specifically deregulated as a consequence of Id-1B overexpression, including IGF2, BMP4, Id2, GATA3, EREG and AREG. Id-1B overexpressing cells that were treated with 4Gy irradiation dose were significantly less resistant to cell death. In vivo assays demonstrated that tumors with high Id-1B levels exhibited less growth (p<0.01), metabolic activity (glucose uptake) and angiogenesis (p<0.05) compared to tumors with low Id-1B expression; mice survival was significantly extended (p<0.05). Quantification by qRT-PCR revealed that expression of Id-1B was significantly lower (p<0.01) in human lung tumors compared to their matched nonmalignant counterparts. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that Id-1B decreases the malignancy of lung and prostate cancer cells, sensitizes them to radiotherapy-induced cell death, and counteracts the protumorigenic role of the classical form of Id-1.""","""['P Nguewa', 'I Manrique', 'R Díaz', 'M Redrado', 'R Parrondo', 'C Perez-Stable', 'A Calvo']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Curr Mol Med""","""['The inhibitor of differentiation isoform Id1b, generated by alternative splicing, maintains cell quiescence and confers self-renewal and cancer stem cell-like properties.', 'Id-1 promotes proliferation of p53-deficient esophageal cancer cells.', 'Regulation of angiogenesis by Id-1 through hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha-mediated vascular endothelial growth factor up-regulation in hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'The multiple roles of Id-1 in cancer progression.', 'Tumor angiogenesis in mice and men.', 'Association of environmental exposure to chromium with differential DNA methylation: An epigenome-wide study.', 'PTBP3 Induced Inhibition of Differentiation of Gastric Cancer Cells Through Alternative Splicing of Id1.', 'Similarities Between Embryo Development and Cancer Process Suggest New Strategies for Research and Therapy of Tumors: A New Point of View.', 'The Id-protein family in developmental and cancer-associated pathways.', 'DNMT1 Regulates Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition and Cancer Stem Cells, Which Promotes Prostate Cancer Metastasis.']"""

Methods:   An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to measure 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (5-HETE) in patient and TRAMP mice blood samples. Kaplan-Meier analysis and the log-rank test were used to analyze the survival of the mice. Immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry were used to assay the expression of 5-LOX in the samples. After treatment with 10 μM zileuton, cell motility and the invasion of PC-3 cells were assayed using immunofluorescence, Western blotting, and transwell. TRAMP mice were treated with zileuton (600 mg/kg and 1200 mg/kg) at 24 weeks of age. Ten weeks later, the mice were killed, and the tumors (size and number) were measured.  Results:   The levels of 5-HETE were significantly greater in the TRAMP mice with metastasis than in the tumors in situ. However, no such difference was found in the human samples. The lifespan of the mice was shorter at high levels of 5-HETE (>2.4 ng/mL). The expression of 5-LOX in the metastasis sample was notably greater than that in the tumors in situ. After treatment with zileuton, the expression of paxillin and E-cadherin in PC-3 and LNCaP cells was upregulated. In the transwell experiments, the motility of PC-3 was suppressed after treatment with zileuton. The mice treated with a high level of zileuton (1200 mg/kg) also had fewer tumors; however, the size did not show a significant difference.

However, clinical trials have shown that those existing drugs exert the minimal antitumor activity and excess adverse effects on PCa patients. Therefore, it is of great interest to figure out novel specific biomarkers to guide the development of new drugs. In present study, an RNAi screening with 44 genes involved in histone modifications was applied to a PCa cell line, Du145. The results showed that nine genes were in positive regulation of Du145 cell growth. Then four selected genes (KAT2B, KAT5, KAT6B and HDAC1) were found to exert this effect by a gene-specific manner when silenced. And then KAT5 or KAT6B silenced cells were subjected to DNA microarray analysis. The common differentially expressed genes were analyzed by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) and found that PDEF signaling, EIF2 signaling and PI3K signaling was suppressed following by KAT5 or KAT6B silencing. Subsequent immunoblotting assay showed that AKT signaling was inhibited, which suggested that KAT5 or KAT6B regulates cancer cell growth through PI3K-AKT signaling.

In this study, a simple and sensitive method was developed for the detection of sarcosine and the two isomers by LC with ion-trap MS through a novel derivatization reagent N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. N,N'-Dicyclohexylcarbodiimide is usually considered as a condensation reagent, however, it was directly used as a derivatization reagent through a rearrangement side reaction in this study. The proposed method not only improved the chromatographic retention behavior of sarcosine and its two isomers, which was a benefit to their separation, but also dramatically enhanced the detection sensitivity of sarcosine, which was more favorable for real sample analysis. The factors affecting the productivity of the derivatization reaction, such as reaction time and amount of derivatization reagent, were systematically optimized.

Many evidences have shown that tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) potently induces apoptosis in cancer cells, and thus, is a promising biologic agent for prostate carcinoma therapy. However, TRAIL expression mediated by the current vectors lacks tumor specificity, thereby exerting cytotoxicity to normal cells. To solve this problem, we inserted miRNA response elements (MREs), miR-143 and miR-145, expression levels of which were reduced in prostate carcinoma, as well as that of miR-122, which is specifically expressed in hepatic cells, into adenoviral vectors to control TRAIL expression (Ad-TRAIL-M3). qPCR data confirmed that miR-143, miR-145, and miR-122 levels were all decreased in prostate carcinoma cell lines and prostate cancer samples from patients. Luciferase assays showed that MREs-regulated luciferase expression was potently suppressed in normal cells, but not in prostate cancer cells. Ad-TRAIL-M3, which expresses TRAIL in a MREs-regulated manner, produced high level of TRAIL and suppressed the survival of prostate cancer cells by inducing apoptosis, while Ad-TRAIL-M3 had no TRAIL expression in normal cells and thus exerted no cytotoxicity to them. The studies on PC-3 tumor xenograft in mice further confirmed that Ad-TRAIL-M3 was able to inhibit the growth of tumors and possessed high biosafety.

As the androgen receptor (AR) remains a critical driver in CRPC, understanding the determinants of its transcriptional activity is important for developing new AR-targeted therapies. FOXA1 is a key component of the AR transcriptional complex yet its role in prostate cancer progression and the relationship between AR and FOXA1 are not completely resolved. It is well established that FOXA1 levels are elevated in advanced prostate cancer and metastases. We mimicked these conditions by overexpressing FOXA1 in the androgen-responsive LNCaP prostate cancer cell line and observed a significant increase in AR genomic binding at novel regions that possess increased chromatin accessibility. High levels of FOXA1 resulted in increased proliferation at both sub-optimal and high 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) concentrations. Immunohistochemical staining for FOXA1 in a clinical prostate cancer cohort revealed that high FOXA1 expression is associated with shorter time to biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy (hazard ratio (HR) 5.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.2-21.1, P=0.028), positive surgical margins and higher stage disease at diagnosis. The gene expression program that results from FOXA1 overexpression is enriched for PTEN, Wnt and other pathways typically represented in CRPC gene signatures.

Models that mimic human CRPC are needed to identify the mechanisms for prostate cancer (PC) growth in bone and to develop new therapeutic strategies. We characterize a new model, LNCaP-19, and investigate the interaction between tumor cells and osteoblasts in the sclerotic tumor response of CRPC. Osteogenic profiling of PC cell lines (LNCaP-19, LNCaP, C4-2B4, and PC-3) was performed by gene expression arrays and mineral staining. Conditioned medium from MC3T3-E1 was used for osteoblast stimulation of CRPC cells. The capacity of LNCaP-19 cells to induce sclerotic lesions was assessed in intratibial xenografts and verified by serum markers, histological analysis and bone mineral density (BMD) measurements. The CRPC cell line LNCaP-19 expresses a pronounced osteogenic profile compared to its parental androgen-dependent cell line LNCaP. Osteoblast-derived factors further increase the expression of genes known to enhance metastatic progression of PC. LNCaP-19 forms sclerotic tumors in tibia of castrated mice as evident by increased total BMD (P < 0.01). There was a strong correlation between serum osteocalcin and BMD (total: R (2) 0.811, P < 0.01, trabecular: R (2) 0.673, P < 0.05). For the first time we demonstrate that a CRPC cell line generated in vitro has osteogenic capacity and that osteomimicry can be an inherent feature of these cells. Osteoblast-derived factors further promote the osteogenic and metastatic phenotype in CRPC cells. Altogether, our model demonstrates that both tumor cells and osteoblasts are mediators of the bone forming process of CRPC.""","""['Malin Hagberg Thulin', 'Karin Jennbacken', 'Jan-Erik Damber', 'Karin Welén']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Clin Exp Metastasis""","""['Osteoblasts promote castration-resistant prostate cancer by altering intratumoral steroidogenesis.', 'A new murine model of osteoblastic/osteolytic lesions from human androgen-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Tasquinimod inhibits prostate cancer growth in bone through alterations in the bone microenvironment.', 'Establishing human prostate cancer cell xenografts in bone: induction of osteoblastic reaction by prostate-specific antigen-producing tumors in athymic and SCID/bg mice using LNCaP and lineage-derived metastatic sublines.', 'Androgen receptor-dependent and -independent mechanisms driving prostate cancer progression: Opportunities for therapeutic targeting from multiple angles.', 'Biomarkers for Prostate Cancer Bone Metastasis Detection and Prediction.', 'Osteoclasts directly influence castration-resistant prostate cancer cells.', 'Intercellular signaling between ameloblastoma and osteoblasts.', 'Loss of microRNA-135b Enhances Bone Metastasis in Prostate Cancer and Predicts Aggressiveness in Human Prostate Samples.', 'Evolving cancer-niche interactions and therapeutic targets during bone metastasis.']"""

Results:   The number and type of symptoms experienced by patients varied by cancer type, but about 90% of patients reported one or more symptoms--with prostate cancer patients reporting fewer symptoms and colorectal patients, more symptoms. Prostate patients also had the lowest symptom burden at every time point. Overall, symptom burden decreased over time, as did the Physical subscale for the MSAS. Quality of life was stable over time, except for physical well-being, which improved. Quality of life was negatively correlated with symptom burden at every time point.  Conclusions:   The differences in symptom experience by cancer type suggest that assessment and management of symptoms must be individually tailored or at least adjusted by cancer type.

Exposure of the general public to significant levels of arsenic is widespread. Arsenic is a well-documented human carcinogen. Long-term exposure to high levels of arsenic in drinking water has been linked to bladder, lung, kidney, liver, prostate, and skin cancers. Among them, lung cancer is of great public concern. However, little is known about how arsenic causes lung cancer and few studies have considered effects in normal human lung cells. The purpose of this study was to determine the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of arsenic in human primary bronchial fibroblast and epithelial cells. Our data show that arsenic induces a concentration-dependent decrease in cell survival after short (24h) or long (120h) exposures. Arsenic induces concentration-dependent but not time-dependent increases in chromosome damage in fibroblasts. No chromosome damage is induced after either 24h or 120h arsenic exposure in epithelial cells. Using neutral comet assay and gamma-H2A.X foci forming assay, we found that 24h or 120h exposure to arsenic induces increases in DNA double strand breaks in both cell lines. These data indicate that arsenic is cytotoxic and genotoxic to human lung primary cells but lung fibroblasts are more sensitive to arsenic than epithelial cells.

Often the dose distribution calculated with a commercial treatment planning system (TPS) is used to estimate radiation carcinogenesis for the radiotherapy patient. However, for locations beyond the treatment field borders, the accuracy is not well known. The aim of this study was to perform detailed out-of-field-measurements for a typical radiotherapy treatment plan administered with a Cyberknife and a Tomotherapy machine and to compare the measurements to the predictions of the TPS.  Materials and methods:   Individually calibrated thermoluminescent dosimeters were used to measure absorbed dose in an anthropomorphic phantom at 184 locations. The measured dose distributions from 6 MV intensity-modulated treatment beams for CyberKnife and TomoTherapy machines were compared to the dose calculations from the TPS.  Results:   The TPS are underestimating the dose far away from the target volume. Quantitatively the Cyberknife underestimates the dose at 40 cm from the PTV border by a factor of 60, the Tomotherapy TPS by a factor of two. If a 50% dose uncertainty is accepted, the Cyberknife TPS can predict doses down to approximately 10 mGy/treatment Gy, the Tomotherapy-TPS down to 0.75 mGy/treatment Gy. The Cyberknife TPS can then be used up to 10 cm from the PTV border the Tomotherapy up to 35 cm.  Conclusions:   We determined that the Cyberknife and Tomotherapy TPS underestimate substantially the doses far away from the treated volume. It is recommended not to use out-of-field doses from the Cyberknife TPS for applications like modeling of second cancer induction.

Objective:   To evaluate the survival of men diagnosed with mPCa based on definitive treatment of the prostate.  Design, setting, and participants:   Men with documented stage IV (M1a-c) PCa at diagnosis identified using Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) (2004-2010) and divided based on definitive treatment of the prostate (radical prostatectomy [RP] or brachytherapy [BT]) or no surgery or radiation therapy (NSR).  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Kaplan-Meier methods were used to calculate overall survival (OS). Multivariable competing risks regression analysis was used to calculate disease-specific survival (DSS) probability and identify factors associated with cause-specific mortality (CSM).  Results and limitations:   A total of 8185 patients were identified: NSR (n=7811), RP (n=245), and BT (n=129). The 5-yr OS and predicted DSS were each significantly higher in patients undergoing RP (67.4% and 75.8%, respectively) or BT (52.6 and 61.3%, respectively) compared with NSR patients (22.5% and 48.7%, respectively) (p<0.001). Undergoing RP or BT was each independently associated with decreased CSM (p<0.01). Similar results were noted regardless of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) M stage. Factors associated with increased CSM in patients undergoing local therapy included AJCC T4 stage, high-grade disease, prostate-specific antigen ≥20 ng/ml, age ≥70 yr, and pelvic lymphadenopathy (p<0.05). The major limitation of this study was the lack of variables from SEER known to influence survival of patients with mPCa, including treatment with systemic therapy.  Conclusions:   Definitive treatment of the prostate in men diagnosed with mPCa suggests a survival benefit in this large population-based study. These results should serve as a foundation for future prospective trials.  Patient summary:   We used a large population-based cancer database to examine survival in men diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer (mPCa) undergoing definitive therapy for the prostate.

However, little is known about their effect on the metastasis of cancer cells, which is the cause of over 90% of patient deaths. In the present investigation, we provide direct evidence that low concentrations of pristine graphene and graphene oxide show no apparent influence on the viability of MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells, PC3 human prostate cancer cells, as well as B16F10 mouse melanoma cells. However, both pristine graphene and graphene oxide can effectively inhibit the migration and invasion of these cancer cells. Further studies indicate that exposure of cells to graphene led to the direct inhibition of the electron transfer chain complexes I, II, III and IV, most likely by disrupting electron transfer between iron-sulfur centers, which is due to its stronger ability to accept electrons compared to iron-sulfur clusters through theoretical calculations. The decreased electron transfer chain activity caused a reduction in the production of ATP and subsequent impairment of F-actin cytoskeleton assembly, which is crucial for the migration and invasion of metastatic cancer cells. The inhibition of cancer cell metastasis by graphene and graphene oxide might provide new insights into specific cancer treatment.""","""['Hejiang Zhou', 'Bo Zhang', 'Jiajia Zheng', 'Meifang Yu', 'Teng Zhou', 'Kai Zhao', 'Yanxia Jia', 'Xingfa Gao', 'Chunying Chen', 'Taotao Wei']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Biomaterials""","""['Energy metabolism analysis reveals the mechanism of inhibition of breast cancer cell metastasis by PEG-modified graphene oxide nanosheets.', 'Multiwalled carbon nanotubes inhibit cell migration and invasion by destroying actin cytoskeleton via mitochondrial dysfunction in ovarian cancer cells.', 'Alteronol inhibits the invasion and metastasis of B16F10 and B16F1 melanoma cells in vitro and in vivo.', 'The role of heme and iron-sulfur clusters in mitochondrial biogenesis, maintenance, and decay with age.', 'Oxidative Stress and Mitochondrial Activation as the Main Mechanisms Underlying Graphene Toxicity against Human Cancer Cells.', 'Green Nanoformulations of Polyvinylpyrrolidone-Capped Metal Nanoparticles: A Study at the Hybrid Interface with Biomimetic Cell Membranes and In Vitro Cell Models.', 'Effect of Melittin Complexes with Graphene and Graphene Oxide on Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Tumors Grown on Chicken Embryo Chorioallantoic Membrane.', 'The αMSH-Dependent PI3K Pathway Supports Energy Metabolism, via Glucose Uptake, in Melanoma Cells.', 'A Novel Four Mitochondrial Respiration-Related Signature for Predicting Biochemical Recurrence of Prostate Cancer.', 'Delivery of Melittin as a Lytic Agent via Graphene Nanoparticles as Carriers to Breast Cancer Cells.']"""

To undertake, for the first time using data from breast, colorectal and prostate cancer patients, a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to assess the validity of the IPQ-R's core seven-factor structure. Also, for the first time in any illness group, to undertake Rasch analysis to explore the extent to which the IPQ-R factors form unidimensional scales, with linear measurement properties and no Differential Item Functioning (DIF).  Methods:   Patients with potentially curable breast, colorectal or prostate cancer, within 6months post-diagnosis, completed the IPQ-R online (N=531). CFA was conducted, including multi-sample analysis, and for each IPQ-R factor fit to the Rasch model was assessed by examining, amongst other things, item fit, DIF and unidimensionality.  Results:   The CFA showed a moderate fit of the data to the IPQ-R model, and stability across diagnosis, although fit was significantly improved following the removal of selected items. All seven factors achieved fit to the Rasch model, and exhibited unidimensionality and minimal DIF, although in most cases this was after some item rescoring and/or deletion. In both analyses, IPQ-R items 12, 18 and 24 were indicated as misfitting and removed.  Conclusion:   Given the rigorous standard of Rasch measurement, and the generic nature of the IPQ-R, it stood up well to the demands of the Rasch model in this study. Importantly, the results show that with some relatively minor, pragmatic modifications the IPQ-R could possess Rasch-standard measurement in cancer patients.""","""['Laura Ashley', 'Adam B Smith', 'Ada Keding', 'Helen Jones', 'Galina Velikova', 'Penny Wright']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Psychosom Res""","""['Traditional and Rasch psychometric analyses of the Quality of Life in Adult Cancer Survivors (QLACS) questionnaire in shorter-term cancer survivors 15 months post-diagnosis.', 'Investigating the factor structure of the Illness Perception Questionnaire-revised for substance dependence among injecting drug users in China.', 'Psychometric Characteristics of the Revised Illness Perception Questionnaire (IPQ-R) in People Undergoing Weight Loss Surgery.', 'Clinimetric properties of illness perception questionnaire revised (IPQ-R) and brief illness perception questionnaire (Brief IPQ) in patients with musculoskeletal disorders: A systematic review.', 'A systematic review and meta-analysis of the Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire.', 'Psychometric approach to evaluate periodontal disease using Revised Illness Perception Questionnaire.', 'Psychometric characteristics of the Revised Illness Perception Questionnaire (IPQ-R) in adults with sickle cell disease.', 'The Illness Belief Network Questionnaire: Development and Evaluation of a Psychosomatic Assessment Tool.', 'Polish Adaptation and Validation of the Revised Illness Perception Questionnaire (IPQ-R) in Cancer Patients.', ""Rasch Analysis of Authentic Evaluation of Young Children's Functioning in Classroom Routines.""]"""

Prior work has used ICG with radiocontrast agents injected at a separate procedure and relied on assistant-controlled fluorescence systems, making the technique costly and cumbersome.  Objective:   To describe the initial optimization and feasibility of fluorescence-enhanced robotic radical prostatectomy (FERRP) using real-time injection of ICG for tissue marking and identification of sentinel lymphatic drainage visualized by a fully integrated surgeon-controlled system.  Design, setting, and participants:   Patients with clinically localized prostate cancer at a tertiary referral center were offered FERRP. Ten patients participated in a pilot arm in which ICG dosing and injection technique were optimized. Fifty consecutive patients then underwent FERRP.  Surgical procedure:   After development of the space of Retzius, 0.4 ml of a 2.5 mg/ml ICG solution were injected into each lobe of the prostate using a robotically guided percutaneous needle. After ICG was allowed to travel through the pelvic lymphatics, lymphadenectomy was performed from the endopelvic fascia to the aortic bifurcation.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Parameters describing the time course of tissue fluorescence and pelvic lymphangiography were systematically recorded. Lymphatic packets containing fluorescent nodes were considered sentinel.  Results and limitations:   Percutaneous, robotic-guided ICG injection proved superior to cystoscope or transrectal delivery. Tissue marking was achieved in all patients, positively identifying the prostate with uniform fluorescence relative to the obturator nerve, seminal vesicles, vas deferens, and neurovascular pedicles at a mean time of 10 min postinjection. Sentinel nodes were identified in 76% of patients at a mean time of 30 min postinjection and had 100% sensitivity, 75.4% specificity, 14.6% positive predictive value, and 100% negative predictive value for the detection of nodal metastasis.  Conclusions:   FERRP is safe, feasible, and allows for reliable prostate tissue marking and identification of sentinel lymphatic drainage in the majority of patients. ICG sentinel nodes are highly sensitive but relatively nonspecific for the detection of nodal metastasis.""","""['Ted B Manny', 'Manish Patel', 'Ashok K Hemal']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Fluorescence guidance during radical prostatectomy.', 'Re: Ted B.

There have been only very limited studies about the impact of PSA on histological findings at prostate biopsy in Turkey. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of PSA and clinical stage on histologic findings of prostate biopsy in men older than 75 years of age as a first study in the Turkish population. A total of 1,645 consecutive prostate biopsies were included, with 194 men aged 75 or older. Cancer was identified in 104 patients (53.6%). Of the 104 positive biopsies, Gleason scores were less than 7 in 53 (49%) patients, 7 or greater in 51 (51%) patients. Positive prostate biopsies were significantly correlated with advanced age (p=0.0001), abnormal DRE (p=0.0001) and raised PSA (p=0.0001). The prostate volume was significantly correlated with advanced age especially in prostate cancer patients over 75 years, compared with those under 75 (p=0.0001). These results are useful for counseling men older than 75 years for prostate cancer detection. However, PCa screening decisions are currently based on urologist judgment and detection of latent asymptomatic disease is an important concern regarding costs, overdiagnosis, overtreatment and quality of life (QOL) for men aged 75 years and older.

The inhibition efficiency (IC50) of the [(nat)F]AlF-NOTA-P2-RM26 was compared to that of the (nat)Ga-loaded peptide using (125)I-Tyr(4)-BBN as the displacement radioligand. The pharmacokinetics and in vivo binding specificity of the compound were studied. NOTA-P2-RM26 was labeled with (18)F within 1 h (60-65% decay corrected radiochemical yield, 55 GBq/µmol). The radiopeptide was stable in murine serum and showed high specific binding to PC-3 cells. [(nat)F]AlF-NOTA-P2-RM26 showed a low nanomolar inhibition efficiency (IC50=4.4±0.8 nM). The internalization rate of the tracer was low. Less than 14% of the cell-bound radioactivity was internalized after 4 h. The biodistribution of [(18)F]AlF-NOTA-P2-RM26 demonstrated rapid blood clearance, low liver uptake and low kidney retention. The tumor uptake at 3 h p.i. was 5.5±0.7 %ID/g, and the tumor-to-blood, -muscle and -bone ratios were 87±42, 159±47, 38±16, respectively. The uptake in tumors, pancreas and other GRPR-expressing organs was significantly reduced when excess amount of non-labeled peptide was co-injected. The low uptake in bone suggests a high in vivo stability of the Al-F bond. High contrast PET image was obtained 3 h p.i. The initial biological results suggest that [(18)F]AlF-NOTA-P2-RM26 is a promising candidate for PET imaging of GRPR in vivo.""","""['Zohreh Varasteh', 'Ola Aberg', 'Irina Velikyan', 'Gunnar Lindeberg', 'Jens Sörensen', 'Mats Larhed', 'Gunnar Antoni', 'Mattias Sandström', 'Vladimir Tolmachev', 'Anna Orlova']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Synthesis and characterization of a high-affinity NOTA-conjugated bombesin antagonist for GRPR-targeted tumor imaging.', 'The effect of macrocyclic chelators on the targeting properties of the 68Ga-labeled gastrin releasing peptide receptor antagonist PEG2-RM26.', 'Positron Emission Tomography Imaging of Prostate Cancer with Ga-68-Labeled Gastrin-Releasing Peptide Receptor Agonist BBN7-14 and Antagonist RM26.', '3-Cyano-4-18Ffluoro-benzoyl-Ala(SO3H)-Ala(SO3H)-Ava-Gln-Trp-Ala-Val-NMeGly-His-Sta-Leu-NH2.', '64Cu-1,4,7-Triazacyclononane-1,4-diacetic acid-9-aminonanoic acid-Gln-Trp-Ala-Val-Gly-His-Leu-Met-NH2.', 'The aluminium-18Ffluoride revolution: simple radiochemistry with a big impact for radiolabelled biomolecules.', 'New Frontiers in Molecular Imaging Using Peptide-Based Radiopharmaceuticals for Prostate Cancer.', 'Stability Evaluation and Stabilization of a Gastrin-Releasing Peptide Receptor (GRPR) Targeting Imaging Pharmaceutical.', 'A Comprehensive Review of Non-Covalent Radiofluorination Approaches Using Aluminum 18Ffluoride: Will 18FAlF Replace 68Ga for Metal Chelate Labeling?', 'Evaluation of Tumor-Targeting Properties of an Antagonistic Bombesin Analogue RM26 Conjugated with a Non-Residualizing Radioiodine Label Comparison with a Radiometal-Labelled Counterpart.']"""

While a majority of prostate cancer cases remain indolent, subsets of patients develop aggressive cancers, which may lead to death. The current methods of detection include digital rectal examination and the serum PSA test. However, due to lack of specificity, neither of these approaches is able to accurately discriminate between indolent and aggressive cancer, which is why there is a need for additional prognostic factors. Previously, we identified enzymes of the ketogenic pathway, particularly ACAT1, to be elevated in aggressive prostate cancer.  Methods:   In the current study, we assessed the diagnostic and prognostic potential of ACAT1 by analyzing its expression using immunohistochemistry on a tissue microarray consisting of 251 clinically localized prostate cancer patients who have undergone radical prostatectomy.  Results:   Using quantitative digital imaging software, we found that ACAT1 expression was significantly greater in cancerous cores compared to adjacent benign cores (P < 0.0001), in Gleason score (GS) ≥8 cancers versus GS≤6 cancers (P < 0.0001), GS≥8 cancers versus GS7 cancers (P = 0.001), as well as pT3/pT4 versus pT2 cancers (P = 0.001). In addition, ACAT1 predicted biochemical recurrence in univariate (HR, 1.81, CI = 1.13-2.9, P = 0.0128), and multivariate models (HR, 1.69, CI = 1.01-2.81, P = 0.0431) including pre-operative PSA level, Gleason score and pathological stage. In univariate time-to-recurrence analysis, ACAT1 expression predicted recurrence in ERG negative cases (P = 0.0025), whereas ERG positive cases did not display any differences.  Discussion:   Taken together, these findings indicate that ACAT1 expression could serve as a potential prognostic marker in prostate cancer, specifically in differentiating indolent and aggressive forms of cancer.""","""['Punit Saraon', 'Dominique Trudel', 'Ken Kron', 'Apostolos Dmitromanolakis', 'John Trachtenberg', 'Bharati Bapat', 'Theodorus van der Kwast', 'Keith A Jarvi', 'Eleftherios P Diamandis']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Impact of positive surgical margins on prostate-specific antigen failure after radical prostatectomy in adjuvant treatment-naïve patients.', 'Pathological and biochemical outcomes after radical prostatectomy in men with low-risk prostate cancer meeting the Prostate Cancer International: Active Surveillance criteria.', 'Gleason score 7 prostate cancer on needle biopsy: is the prognostic difference in Gleason scores 4 + 3 and 3 + 4 independent of the number of involved cores?', 'Prostate biopsy: who, how and when.

Materials and methods:   Patients with histologically proven prostate adenocarcinoma treated with radical radiotherapy and followed up for at least 6 months were selected. The correlation between late rectal bleeding and a number of factors was investigated by univariate and multivariate analysis.  Results:   A total of 278 patients who underwent radiotherapy at our institution between October 2002 and May 2011 were selected. At univariate analysis, delivery of radiation doses higher than 70 Gy and use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors were associated with a higher incidence of rectal bleeding. Conversely, patients who used calcium channel blockers had a lower risk (3-year rectal bleeding-free survival 89.8 versus 66.5 %, p = 0.043). At multivariate analysis, use of calcium channel blockers was found to have a protective effect with a hazard ratio of 0.3 (95 % CI 0.12-0.96). Delivery of higher radiation doses was associated with an increased risk of rectal bleeding (hazard ratio 3.02, 95 % CI 1.23-7.38).

Methods:   A cohort of newly diagnosed prostate cancer patients (1998-2006) was identified in the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink (confirmed by cancer registry linkage). A nested case-control analysis was conducted using conditional logistic regression to compare aspirin usage in cases (prostate cancer deaths) with up to three controls (matched by age and year of diagnosis).  Results:   Post-diagnostic low-dose aspirin use was identified in 52 % of 1,184 prostate cancer-specific deaths and 39 % of 3,531 matched controls (unadjusted OR 1.51, 95 % CI 1.19, 1.90; p < 0.001).

Average-risk patients received annual mammogram, whereas high-risk patients received annual MRI.

Prostate cancer stem-like cells highly express EpCAM. However, little is known about how EpCAM is involved in the ability of cells to adapt to micro-environmental changes in available growth factors, which is one of the essential biological phenotypes of cancer stem-like cells (CSCs).  Methods:   EpCAM-high and EpCAM-low subpopulations of cells were established from the prostate cancer cell line PC-3. Signal transductions in response to serum starvation, and on the exposure to EGF ligand or the specific inhibitor were analyzed in terms. Furthermore, we analyzed the expression level of amino acid transporters which contribute to the activation of mTOR signal between the two subgroups.  Results:   EpCAM-high and EpCAM-low PC-3 subpopulations showed markedly different responses to serum starvation. EpCAM expression was positively correlated with activation of the mTOR and epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathways. Furthermore, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) was gradually de-activated in EpCAM-low PC-3 cells in the absence of serum.  Conclusions:   EpCAM regulates the AMPK signaling pathway, essential for the response to growth factors characterized by EGF.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between the mentioned IL-6 polymorphism and CaP risk, as well as to compare the genotype frequency between the different tumour grades of CaP, in population of Eastern Croatia. We analyzed the IL-6 polymorphism in 120 CaP patients and 120 controls with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).

Furthermore, high IL-6 producer genotypes (GG or GC) were more frequent in controls than in CaP group (86.7% vs 80.8%, respectively, p = 0.147). Also, no statistically significant difference in IL-6 high and low producer genotype frequency was noticed between well, moderately and poorly differentiated tumours. Our results, taken together with other studies on the subject, suggest that IL-6 - 174 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) distribution may differ between various ethnic groups and that a single cytokine gene polymorphism has probably just a minor effect on CaP susceptibility.

However, resistance to enzalutamide can develop frequently in initial responders. This study aimed to test whether overexpression of IL-6 and constitutive activation of Stat3 in prostate cancer cells increase resistance to enzalutamide.  Experimental design:   Sensitivity of prostate cancer cells to enzalutamide was tested using cell growth assays and clonogenic assays. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR, ELISA, and Western blotting were performed to detect expression levels of IL-6, c-Myc, survivin, and AR. Expression of Stat3 was downregulated using siRNA specific to Stat3. ChIP assay was performed to examine recruitment of AR to the PSA promoter.  Results:   Prostate cancer cells expressing autocrine IL-6 are resistant to enzalutamide and autocrine IL-6 leads to constitutive activation of Stat3 and its target genes. Down regulation of Stat3 led to an increase in sensitivity of prostate cancer cells to enzalutamide. Overexpression of constitutively active Stat3 in prostate cancer cells induced resistance to enzalutamide treatment. Constitutively active Stat3 also enhanced the recruitment of AR to PSA promoter which could not be disrupted by enzalutamide. The Stat3 inhibitor AG490 reversed enzalutamide resistance in prostate cancer cells, while combination treatment with enzalutamide and AG490 significantly inhibited cell growth and induced cell apoptosis.  Conclusions:   This study demonstrates that the autocrine IL-6 pathway induces enzalutamide resistance in prostate cancer cells via the constitutive activation of Stat3. Co-targeting IL6-Stat3 pathway with enzalutamide may be utilized for treatment of advanced prostate cancer.""","""['Chengfei Liu', 'Yezi Zhu', 'Wei Lou', 'Yuanyuan Cui', 'Christopher P Evans', 'Allen C Gao']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Overcoming Acquired Drug Resistance to Cancer Therapies through Targeted STAT3 Inhibition.', 'Niclosamide suppresses cell migration and invasion in enzalutamide resistant prostate cancer cells via Stat3-AR axis inhibition.', 'Blocking the Feedback Loop between Neuroendocrine Differentiation and Macrophages Improves the Therapeutic Effects of Enzalutamide (MDV3100) on Prostate Cancer.', 'Niclosamide inhibits androgen receptor variants expression and overcomes enzalutamide resistance in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'STAT3 signaling in prostate cancer progression and therapy resistance: An oncogenic pathway with diverse functions.', 'Effectiveness of tumor‑treating fields to reduce the proliferation and migration of liposarcoma cell lines.', 'STL127705 synergize with olaparib in castration-resistant prostate cancer by inhibiting homologous recombination and non-homologous end-joining repair.', 'Evolving cognition of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway: autoimmune disorders and cancer.', 'LOX-1 Activation by oxLDL Induces AR and AR-V7 Expression via NF-κB and STAT3 Signaling Pathways Reducing Enzalutamide Cytotoxic Effects.', 'Overcoming Acquired Drug Resistance to Cancer Therapies through Targeted STAT3 Inhibition.']"""

Case-control studies have been performed to elucidate the role of A2455G in cancer; however, the results are conflicting and heterogeneous. Hence, we performed a meta-analysis to investigate the association between cancer susceptibility and A2455G (64,593 cases and 91,056 controls from 272 studies) polymorphism in different inheritance models. We used odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals to assess the strength of the association. Overall, significantly increased cancer risk was observed in any genetic model (dominant model, odds ration [OR] = 1.19, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.13-1.25; recessive model: OR = 1.41, 95% CI = 1.29-1.54; additive model: OR = 1.49, 95% CI = 1.35-1.65) when all eligible studies were pooled into the meta-analysis. In further stratified and sensitivity analyses, the elevated risk remained for subgroups of breast cancer, colorectal cancer, esophageal cancer, hepatocellular cancer, head and neck cancer, leukemia, lung cancer, and prostate cancer, but these associations vary in different ethnic populations. In summary, this meta-analysis suggests the participation of A2455G in the susceptibility for some cancers, such as breast cancer, colorectal cancer, lung cancer, and so on. Moreover, ethnicity, histological type of cancer, and smokers seem to contribute to varying expressions of the A2455G on some cancers risk. In addition, our work also points out the importance of new studies for A2455G polymorphism in some cancer types, such as gallbladder cancer, Indians of breast cancer, and Caucasians of ovarians, because these cancer types had high heterogeneity in this meta-analysis (I(2) > 75%).""","""['Jun Qin', 'Jin-Xia Zhang', 'Xiao-Ping Li', 'Bu-Qiang Wu', 'Guang-Bin Chen', 'Xiao-Feng He']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Tumour Biol""","""['Evaluation of association studies and a systematic review and meta-analysis of CYP1A1 T3801C and A2455G polymorphisms in breast cancer risk.', 'Association between the CYP1A1 T3801C polymorphism and risk of cancer: evidence from 268 case-control studies.', 'Association between CYP1A1 polymorphisms and esophageal cancer: a meta-analysis.', 'Four polymorphisms in cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1) gene and breast cancer risk: a meta-analysis.', 'Cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1) Gene Polymorphisms and Susceptibility to Breast Cancer: a Meta-Analysis in the Chinese Population.', 'Evaluation of association studies and a systematic review and meta-analysis of CYP1A1 T3801C and A2455G polymorphisms in breast cancer risk.', 'Evaluating the predictive value of genetic risk score in colorectal cancer among Chinese Han population.', 'Meta-analysis of genetic polymorphisms in xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes and their association with breast cancer risk.', 'CYP1A1 Ile462Val Polymorphism Is Associated with Cervical Cancer Risk in Caucasians Not Asians: A Meta-Analysis.', 'The association of the CYP1A1 Ile462Val polymorphism with head and neck cancer risk: evidence based on a cumulative meta-analysis.']"""

Dose rate constant, radial dose function and anisotropy function values were calculated and compared with previously published data. Dose enhancement factors (DEFs) were calculated for Fe2O3, Ag, Gd, Pt and Au nanoparticles with concentrations of 7, 18 and 30 mg/ml. Our source simulation was validated by comparing our results with previously published data. Maximum DEF values on the central transverse line, within the tumour, for Fe2O3, Ag, Gd, Pt and Au nanoparticles with 30 mg/ml concentration were 1.27, 1.15, 1.14, 1.32, 1.79, respectively. No general trend in DEF with increasing atomic number, or concentration of nanoparticles was observed. However, DEF was the highest for 30 mg/ml concentration of Au. The 50 % isodose line tightened toward the central point of the spherical tumour and the central 100 % isodose line expanded outward. The presence of nanoparticles in a prostate tumour increases the dose inside tumour and decreases the dose outside it, thus the treatment time and source activity can be decreased due to dose enhancement in the tumour. While more preclinical studies on other aspects are necessary, using nanoparticles can be proposed as a useful tool in prostate brachytherapy.

Training programs currently focus on treatment, while survivorship care focuses on time after treatment. Cancer survivorship training represents an education paradigm shift.  Methods:   The Cancer Survivorship Workshop was held at the James P. Wilmot Cancer Center of the University of Rochester in academic year 2011-2012, with six sessions held. Objectives included the following: learning about survivorship from patient, primary care physician, and oncologist perspectives using a curriculum based on survivorship literature; designing treatment summaries (TSs) and survivorship care plans (SCPs) for five malignancies (lung, breast, prostate, colon, and lymphoma); and establishing collaboration between hematology/oncology (HO) and radiation oncology (RO) trainees by working together in teams. Course impact was assessed pre- and post-training using a 13-question survey. Questions were answered using a 10-point scale, with predefined rating for each question.  Results:   Statistically significant differences in responses to several survey questions were observed comparing pre- and post-course experience. Improvement was noted in comfort discussing survivorship issues with patients (p = 0.001), reported knowledge of survivorship care for five types of cancer (p = 0.002), confidence in ability to explain a SCP (p = 0.001), and comfort discussing late effects of cancer treatment (p = 0.001). Five unique sets of TS and SCPs were completed.  Conclusions:   This study demonstrates the feasibility of implementing cancer survivorship education into the curriculum of HO and RO training.

The thermal damages of the autonomous nerves in the little pelvis caused by dissection devices remains a large problem. For our patients, we use water-jet dissection (WJD)-aided TME with the intention to minimise the rate of bladder and sexual function disorders.  Methods:   From October 2001 until June 2010, we recorded 125 patients with an adenocarcinoma of the middle and lower third of the rectum. Ninety deep anterior rectum resections and 35 abdominoperineal rectum extirpations by WJD were performed. Of the patients, 27.2 % received neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy. Bladder and sexual function disorders were assessed by International Prostate Symptom Score and International Index of Erectile Function.  Results:   The median follow-up period was 46 (2-117) months. Considering a local recurrence rate of 9.6 %, the tumour-specific 5-year survival of the entire collective was 75.4 %. Long-term bladder function disorders showed in 6.0 % (4/64) and sexual function disorders in 25.0 % (9/36) of the male patients in the course of time.  Conclusion:   The specific advantage of the WJD technique is not only the facilitated dissection between the mesorectal fascia and the surrounding nervous structures in the little pelvis but also a completely athermal TME. The rate of bladder and sexual function disorders is an excellent result compared to that of international centres.

Accurate prostate volume (PV) assessment is necessary for PSAD calculation and both BPH diagnosis and treatment response monitoring; therefore, accurate PV measurement is increasingly becoming an essential step in the urology.  Methods:   Magnetic resonance imaging was used for PV estimation. A new technique based on single-class support-vector machines (S SVM) for accurate PV estimation was realized. Three estimation methods were compared; method 1: planimetry (reference), method 2: S SVM based, and method 3: prolate ellipsoid.  Results:   Method 1 and method 2 depict a strong correlation (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient ρ = 0.965, p > 0.001).

The mean difference between method 1 and method 2 was -0.05 ml. The limits of agreement with the 95 % confidence interval were -3.8 to 3.7 ml. Comparing method 3 and the two other methods shows a worse agreement with mean difference of 8.6 ml (95 % confidence interval of 1.0-16.2 ml) and 8.6 ml (95 % confidence interval of -0.7 to 18.0 ml), respectively.

Iodine supplementation prevented the overexpression of NIS in the TRAMP mice, but had no effect on the GUT weight, cell phenotype, proliferation or apoptosis. In TRAMP mice, iodine increased p53 expression but had no effect on p21 (a p53-dependent gene).

The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane protein Sec62 is a key player in these processes. Sec62 is essential for cell migration and protects tumor cells against thapsigargin-induced ER stress, which are both linked to cytosolic Ca²⁺. SEC62 silencing leads to elevated cytosolic Ca²⁺ and increased ER Ca²⁺ leakage after thapsigargin treatment. Sec62 protein levels are significantly increased in different tumors, including prostate, lung and thyroid cancer.  Methods:   In lung cancer, the influence of Sec62 protein levels on patient survival was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test. To elucidate the underlying pathophysiological functions of Sec62, Ca²⁺ imaging techniques, real-time cell analysis and cell migration assays were performed. The effects of treatment with the calmodulin antagonists, trifluoperazine (TFP) and ophiobolin A, on cellular Ca²⁺ homeostasis, cell growth and cell migration were compared with the effects of siRNA-mediated Sec62 depletion or the expression of a mutated SEC62 variant in vitro. Using Biacore analysis we examined the Ca²⁺-sensitive interaction of Sec62 with the Sec61 complex.  Results:   Sec62 overproduction significantly correlated with reduced patient survival. Therefore, Sec62 is not only a predictive marker for this type of tumor, but also an interesting therapeutic target. The present study suggests a regulatory function for Sec62 in the major Ca²⁺ leakage channel in the ER, Sec61, by a direct and Ca²⁺-sensitive interaction. A Ca²⁺-binding motif in Sec62 is essential for its molecular function. Treatment of cells with calmodulin antagonists mimicked Sec62 depletion by inhibiting cell migration and rendering the cells sensitive to thapsigargin treatment.  Conclusions:   Targeting tumors that overproduce Sec62 with calmodulin antagonists in combination with targeted thapsigargin analogues may offer novel personalized therapeutic options.""","""['Maximilian Linxweiler', 'Stefan Schorr', 'Nico Schäuble', 'Martin Jung', 'Johannes Linxweiler', 'Frank Langer', 'Hans-Joachim Schäfers', 'Adolfo Cavalié', 'Richard Zimmermann', 'Markus Greiner']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Treatment of SEC62 over-expressing tumors by Thapsigargin and Trifluoperazine.', 'Sec62 bridges the gap from 3q amplification to molecular cell biology in non-small cell lung cancer.', 'The endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein Sec62 as potential therapeutic target in SEC62 overexpressing tumors.', 'Identification of signal peptide features for substrate specificity in human Sec62/Sec63-dependent ER protein import.', 'Role of the SEC62 gene in dermato-oncology - impact on tumor cell biology, prognostication, and personalized therapy management.', 'The 3q Oncogene SEC62 Predicts Response to Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy and Regulates Tumor Cell Migration in Triple Negative Breast Cancer.', 'Editorial: The evolving picture of Ca2+ leak from endoplasmic reticulum in health and diseases.', 'Repurposing the antipsychotic drug amisulpride for targeting synovial fibroblast activation in arthritis.', 'Sec61γ is a vital protein in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane promoting tumor metastasis and invasion in lung adenocarcinoma.', 'Effect of the 3q26-coding oncogene SEC62 as a potential prognostic marker in patients with ovarian neoplasia.']"""

The biochemical suicide molecule endonuclease DNaseX (DNaseI-like 1) has been used to identify the Apo10 protein epitope that marks tumor cells with abnormal apoptosis and proliferation. The transketolase-like protein 1 (TKTL1) represents the enzymatic basis for an anaerobic glucose metabolism even in the presence of oxygen (aerobic glycolysis/Warburg effect), which is concomitant with a more malignant phenotype due to invasive growth/metastasis and resistance to radical and apoptosis inducing therapies.  Methods:   Expression of Apo10 and TKTL1 was analysed retrospectively in OSCC specimen (n = 161) by immunohistochemistry. Both markers represent independent markers for poor survival. Furthermore Apo10 and TKTL1 have been used prospectively for epitope detection in monocytes (EDIM)-blood test in patients with OSCC (n = 50), breast cancer (n = 48), prostate cancer (n = 115), and blood donors/controls (n = 74).  Results:   Positive Apo10 and TKTL1 expression were associated with recurrence of the tumor. Multivariate analysis demonstrated Apo10 and TKTL1 expression as an independent prognostic factor for reduced tumor-specific survival. Apo10+/TKTL1+ subgroup showed the worst disease-free survival rate in OSCC.EDIM-Apo10 and EDIM-TKTL1 blood tests allowed a sensitive and specific detection of patients with OSCC, breast cancer and prostate cancer before surgery and in after care. A combined score of Apo10+/TKTL1+ led to a sensitivity of 95.8% and a specificity of 97.3% for the detection of carcinomas independent of the tumor entity.  Conclusions:   The combined detection of two independent fundamental biophysical processes by the two biomarkers Apo10 and TKTL1 allows a sensitive and specific detection of neoplasia in a noninvasive and cost-effective way.

However, thus far, the number of cases studied from some tumor types has been limited. In this study, we set out to assess PSMA expression in the tumor-associated vasculature associated with invasive breast carcinomas in a sizable cohort of patients. One hundred and six patients with AJCC stage 0-IV breast cancer were identified. Ninety-two of these patients had primary breast cancer [invasive breast carcinoma with or without co-existing ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) (74) or DCIS alone (18)]. In addition, 14 patients with breast cancer metastases to the brain were identified. Immunohistochemical staining for PSMA and CD31 was performed on parallel representative tumor sections in each case. Tumor-associated vascular endothelial cell PSMA immunoreactivity was semi-quantitatively assessed based on two parameters: overall percent of endothelial positivity and staining intensity. PSMA expression for tumor-associated vascular endothelial cells was scored 0 if there was no detectable PSMA expression, 1 if PSMA staining was detectable in 5-50%, and 2 if PSMA expression was positive in >50% of microvessels. CD 31 staining was concurrently reviewed to confirm the presence of vasculature in each case. Tumor-associated vasculature was PSMA-positive in 68/92 (74%) of primary breast cancers and in 14/14 (100%) of breast cancers metastatic to brain. PSMA was not detected in normal breast tissue or carcinoma cells. All but 2 cases (98%) showed absence of PSMA expression in normal breast tissue-associated vasculature. The 10-year overall survival was 88.7% (95% CI = 80.0%, 93.8%) in patients without brain metastases. When overall survival (OS) was stratified based on PSMA score group, patients with PSMA scores of 0, 1, and 2 had 10-year OS of 95.8%, 96.0%, and 79.7%, respectively (p = 0.12). When PSMA scores of 0 and 1 were compared with 2, there was a statistically significant difference in OS (96.0% vs 79.7%, respectively, p = 0.05). Patients with a PSMA score of 2 had a significantly higher median tumor size compared with patients in the lower PSMA score groups (p = 0.04). Patients with higher nuclear grade were more likely to have a PSMA score of 2 compared with patients with lower nuclear grade (p < 0.0001). Patients with a PSMA score of 2 had a significantly higher median Ki-67 proliferation index compared with patients in the lower PSMA score groups (p < 0.0001). Patients with estrogen receptor (ER)-negative tumors were more likely to have a PSMA score of 2 compared with patients with ER-positive tumors (p < 0.0001). Patients with progesterone receptor (PR)-negative tumors were more likely to have a PSMA score of 2 compared with patients with PR-positive tumors (p = 0.03). No significant association was observed between PSMA score group status and lymph node involvement (p = 0.95). Too little variability was present in Human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (Her2/neu) amplified tumors to correlate with PSMA score group status. To date, this is the first detailed assessment of PSMA expression in the tumor-associated vasculature of primary and metastatic breast carcinomas.

NAD is used by hundreds of enzymes that catalyze substrate oxidation and, as such, it plays a key role in various biological processes such as aging, cell death, and oxidative stress. It has been suggested that changes in the ratio of free cytosolic [NAD(+)]/[NADH] reflects metabolic alterations leading to, or correlating with, pathological states. We have designed an isotopically labeled metabolic bioprobe of free cytosolic [NAD(+)]/[NADH] by combining a magnetic enhancement technique (hyperpolarization) with cellular glycolytic activity. The bioprobe reports free cytosolic [NAD(+)]/[NADH] ratios based on dynamically measured in-cell [pyruvate]/[lactate] ratios. We demonstrate its utility in breast and prostate cancer cells. The free cytosolic [NAD(+)]/[NADH] ratio determined in prostate cancer cells was 4 times higher than in breast cancer cells. This higher ratio reflects a distinct metabolic phenotype of prostate cancer cells consistent with previously reported alterations in the energy metabolism of these cells.

Methods:   From 1990 to 2011, 8128 men with localized prostate cancer (≤ T3cN0M0) were treated definitively within the Cancer of the Prostate Strategic Urologic Research Endeavor (CaPSURE) registry with 1 of 5 primary treatments: BT, external beam radiotherapy (EBRT), EBRT with androgen deprivation therapy, EBRT+BT, or radical prostatectomy. Men were categorized into low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups based on the guidelines' risk-group definitions.

We calculated the summary relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for ever, moderate and highest consumption of coffee vs non/lowest consumption. The dose-response relationship was assessed by restricted cubic spline model and multivariate random-effect meta-regression.  Results:   A total of 12 case-control studies and 12 cohort studies with 42,179 cases were selected for final meta-analysis. No significant associations were found among overall analysis. A borderline positive association was found for highest drinkers in five small hospital-based case-control (HCC) studies involving 2278 cases. However, compared with non/lowest drinkers, the summary RRs were 0.92 (95% CI=0.85-0.99) for ever drinkers, 0.92 (95% CI=0.85-1.00) for moderate drinkers and 0.83 (95% CI=0.72-0.96) for highest drinkers from 12 cohort studies, comprising a total of 34,424 cases.

A significant inverse relationship was also found for fatal prostate cancers and high-grade prostate cancers.  Conclusions:   Case-control studies especially HCC ones might be prone to selection bias and recall bias that might have contributed to the conflicting results.

The current study was performed to characterise the extent of cancer in men treated by radical prostatectomy (RP) in a community without population-based PSA screening. Clinical and pathological data of 2900 patients who underwent RP between 2008 and 2012 were analysed. Specimens were entirely embedded and evaluated by routine haematoxylin and eosin staining. Tumours were graded using recent modifications to the International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) modified Gleason grading system, and staged according to the ISUP recommendations. Tumours were considered pathologically insignificant if organ confined, with a volume of <0.5 cc and a Gleason score (GS) of <7. The mean age of patients in the series was 63 years (range 32-79 years) and the mean pre-operative PSA was 7.16 ng/mL (range 0.4-69). In total, 2614 (90.1%) were classified as cT1; however, insignificant tumours were found in only 150 (5.2%) patients following examination of the radical prostatectomy specimen. A total of 2681 cases (92.4%) had a final GS of ≥7, 1144 (39.4%) had extraprostatic extension (EPE), of which 88.7% were classified as established; 669 (23.1%) had a tumour volume of >3 cc and 284 (9.8%) had surgical margin positivity. Seminal vesicle involvement was seen in 159 (5.5%) cases. Of 693 patients who had a lymphadenectomy, 31 (4.5%) had lymph node metastases. Aged ≤50 years were 212 (7.3%) patients (mean age 47 years). Of these, 194 were classified as cT1 while 192 (90.6%) were found to have significant cancer on examination of the radical prostatectomy specimen. We have shown in our series that although 90.1% of tumours were cT1, an overwhelming majority of tumours were found to be pathologically significant following RP, with a high proportion of cases showing high stage disease, seminal vesicle involvement and lymph node metastasis.

Changing incidence of these cancers over time may reflect changes in three factors: HIV population demographic structure (e.g. age distribution), general population (background) cancer rates, and HIV-associated relative risks. We assessed the contributions of these factors to time trends for 10 cancers during 1996-2010.  Design:   Population-based registry linkage study.  Methods:   We applied Poisson models to data from the U.S. HIV/AIDS Cancer Match Study to estimate annual percentage changes (APCs) in incidence rates of AIDS-defining cancers [ADCs: Kaposi sarcoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), and cervical cancer] and seven non-AIDS-defining cancers (NADCs). We evaluated HIV-infected cancer trends with and without adjustment for demographics, trends in background rates, and trends in standardized incidence ratios (SIRs, to capture relative risk).  Results:   Cancer rates among HIV-infected people rose over time for anal (APC 3.8%), liver (8.5%), and prostate (9.8%) cancers, but declined for Kaposi sarcoma (1996-2000: -29.3%; 2000-2010: -7.8%), NHL (1996-2003: -15.7%; 2003-2010: -5.5%), cervical cancer (-11.1%), Hodgkin lymphoma (-4.0%), and lung cancer (-2.8%). Breast and colorectal cancer incidence did not change over time. Based on comparison to adjusted models, changing demographics contributed to trends for Kaposi sarcoma and breast, colorectal, liver, lung, and prostate cancers (all P < 0.01). Trends in background rates were notable for liver (APC 5.6%) and lung (-3.2%) cancers. SIRs declined for ADCs, Hodgkin lymphoma (APC -3.2%), and lung cancer (-4.4%).  Conclusion:   Demographic shifts influenced several cancer trends among HIV-infected individuals.

'How to use PSA' remains a current issue, either for diagnosis as a gray zone corresponding to a concentration in serum of 2.5-10 ng/ml which does not allow a clear differentiation to be made between cancer and noncancer(2) or for patient follow-up as analysis of post-operative PSA kinetic parameters can pose considerable challenges for their practical application(3,4). Alternatively, noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) are emerging as key molecules in human cancer, with the potential to serve as novel markers of disease, e.g. PCA3 in prostate cancer(5,6) and to reveal uncharacterized aspects of tumor biology. Moreover, data from the ENCODE project published in 2012 showed that different RNA types cover about 62% of the genome. It also appears that the amount of transcriptional regulatory motifs is at least 4.5x higher than the one corresponding to protein-coding exons. Thus, long terminal repeats (LTRs) of human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) constitute a wide range of putative/candidate transcriptional regulatory sequences, as it is their primary function in infectious retroviruses. HERVs, which are spread throughout the human genome, originate from ancestral and independent infections within the germ line, followed by copy-paste propagation processes and leading to multicopy families occupying 8% of the human genome (note that exons span 2% of our genome). Some HERV loci still express proteins that have been associated with several pathologies including cancer(7-10). We have designed a high-density microarray, in Affymetrix format, aiming to optimally characterize individual HERV loci expression, in order to better understand whether they can be active, if they drive ncRNA transcription or modulate coding gene expression.

Methods:   The data of 15 biopsy-proven prostate cancer patients were evaluated. The prescribed dose was 78 Gy to the planning target volume (PTV78) including the prostate and seminal vesicles and 86 Gy (PTV86) in 39 fractions to the intraprostatic lesion, which was delineated by MRI or MR-spectroscopy.  Results:   PTV dose homogeneity was better for IMRT than VMAT at all energy levels for both PTV78 and PTV86. Lower rectum doses (V30-V50) were significantly higher with SIB compared with PTV78 plans in both IMRT and VMAT plans at all energy levels. The bladder doses at high dose level (V60-V80) were significantly higher in IMRT plans with SIB at all energy levels compared with PTV78 plans, but no significant difference was observed in VMAT plans. VMAT plans resulted in a significant decrease in the mean monitor units (MUs) for 6, 10, and 15 MV energy levels both in plans with and those without SIB.  Conclusion:   Dose escalation to intraprostatic lesions with 86 Gy is safe without causing serious increase in organs at risk (OARs) doses. VMAT is advantageous in sparing OARs and requiring less MU than IMRT.  Advances in knowledge:   VMAT with SIB to intraprostatic lesion is a feasible method in treating prostate cancer.

The expression of NANOGP8 has been documented in several cancers and is related to cell proliferation and tumor development. However, the regulation of NANOGP8 expression has not been investigated. Therefore, the role of NANOGP8 in cell proliferation has not been completely understood.  Methods:   We evaluate the expression of NANOG1 and NANOGP8 in prostate cancer cell lines and primary cultures of prostate tissues. We investigate clonogenicity, sphere formation, and xenograft tumor growth of prostate cancer cells with an activated 5'flanking region of NANOGP8. We examine the role of NANOGP8 in cell cycle progression.  Results:   In the prostate cells the NANOG RNA was transcribed from NANOGP8 and not from NANOG1. Cells with the activated 5'flanking region of NANOGP8 exhibited enhanced clonogenicity, sphere formation, and xenograft tumor growth. The sphere culture and tumor initiation mouse mode promoted the activation of the 5'flanking region of NANOGP8. Forced expression of NANOGP8 increased the entry into the cell cycle.  Discussion:   In prostate cells NANOGP8 is a predominant molecule of NANOG. The activation of 5'flanking sequence of NANOGP8 could play a role in the regulation of the stem-like properties of cancer stem cells and prostate tumor initiation and development.

Preclinical studies of prostate cancer (PCa) have shown anti-tumor activity with digoxin. We explore the relationship between use of digoxin and PCa risk.  Methods:   Data from a population-based case-control study of incident cases aged 35-74 years at PCa diagnosis in 2002-2005 in King County, Washington were available. Controls were identified by random digit dialing and frequency matched by age. Use of digoxin was determined from in-person questionnaires regarding medical and prescription history. The relationship of digoxin use with PCa risk was evaluated with logistic regression.  Results:   One thousand one cases of PCa and 942 controls were analyzed. The prevalence of digoxin use in controls was 2.7%, and use was positively correlated with age. In multivariate analysis adjusting for age, race, PSA screening, and family history of PCa, digoxin use was associated with a reduction in the odds ratio of PCa (OR 0.58, 95% CI: 0.30-1.10). Among those with ≥3 PSA tests over the preceding 5 years (546 cases, 380 controls), digoxin use was associated with a stronger reduction of PCa risk (OR 0.44, 95% CI: 0.20-0.98).  Conclusion:   These data indicate digoxin use may be associated with a reduction in risk of PCa.

Data and methods:   Patients with localised prostate cancer and their partners were recruited from a prospective multicenter study in Germany, the Prostate Cancer, Sexuality, and Partnership (ProCaSP) Study. At five observation times during the follow-up period of 2 years after diagnosis, QoL (EORTC QLQ-C30) and personal, social, and cancer-related health factors as well as adaptation and coping factors of 293 couples were observed and analysed with mixed effects analysis.  Results:   The men's prostate cancer diagnosis had a small, but significant impact on their partner's QoL. However, QoL of partners was most affected by the partners' own physical health and psychological condition, time, and their relationship quality.  Conclusion:   The finding that average QoL increased again 3 months after diagnosis and later should give partners faith and hope for the future.

Importantly, decreased MTSS1 expression is associated with more aggressive forms of breast and prostate cancers, and with poor survival rate. Currently, it remains unclear how MTSS1 is regulated in cancer cells, and whether reduced MTSS1 expression contributes to elevated cancer cell proliferation and migration. Here we report that the SCFβ-TRCP regulates MTSS1 protein stability by targeting it for ubiquitination and subsequent destruction via the 26S proteasome. Notably, depletion of either Cullin 1 or β-TRCP1 led to increased levels of MTSS1. We further demonstrated a crucial role for Ser322 in the DSGXXS degron of MTSS1 in governing SCFβ-TRCP-mediated MTSS1 degradation. Mechanistically, we defined that Casein Kinase Iδ (CKIδ) phosphorylates Ser322 to trigger MTSS1's interaction with β-TRCP for subsequent ubiquitination and degradation. Importantly, introducing wild-type MTSS1 or a non-degradable MTSS1 (S322A) into breast or prostate cancer cells with low MTSS1 expression significantly inhibited cellular proliferation and migration. Moreover, S322A-MTSS1 exhibited stronger effects in inhibiting cell proliferation and migration when compared to ectopic expression of wild-type MTSS1. Therefore, our study provides a novel molecular mechanism for the negative regulation of MTSS1 by β-TRCP in cancer cells. It further suggests that preventing MTSS1 degradation could be a possible novel strategy for clinical treatment of more aggressive breast and prostate cancers.""","""['Jiateng Zhong', 'Shavali Shaik', 'Lixin Wan', 'Adriana E Tron', 'Zhiwei Wang', 'Liankun Sun', 'Hiroyuki Inuzuka', 'Wenyi Wei']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['SCF(β-TRCP)-mediated degradation of NEDD4 inhibits tumorigenesis through modulating the PTEN/Akt signaling pathway.', 'DNA damage-induced activation of ATM promotes β-TRCP-mediated Mdm2 ubiquitination and destruction.', 'Fas-associated factor 1 is a scaffold protein that promotes β-transducin repeat-containing protein (β-TrCP)-mediated β-catenin ubiquitination and degradation.', 'The characteristics and roles of β-TrCP1/2 in carcinogenesis.', 'Novel insights into the molecular mechanisms governing Mdm2 ubiquitination and destruction.', 'Dysregulation of the Ubiquitin Proteasome System in Human Malignancies: A Window for Therapeutic Intervention.', 'Post-Translational Modifications That Drive Prostate Cancer Progression.', 'The Effect of Dysfunctional Ubiquitin Enzymes in the Pathogenesis of Most Common Diseases.', 'CK1δ as a potential therapeutic target to treat bladder cancer.', 'F-box proteins and cancer: an update from functional and regulatory mechanism to therapeutic clinical prospects.']"""

TSC2 protein complexes with TSC1 and blocks the ability of the Rheb (Ras homolog enriched in brain) GTPase to activate mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin), a crucial signal transducer which regulates protein synthesis and cell growth. Here, we report the characterisation of a novel isoform of TSC2 which is under direct control of the ligand-activated androgen receptor. TSC2 isoform A (TSC2A) is derived from an internal androgen-regulated alternative promoter and encodes a 508-amino acid cytoplasmic protein corresponding to the C-terminal region of full-length TSC2, lacking the interaction domain for TSC1 and containing an incomplete interaction domain required for Rheb inactivation. Expression of TSC2A is induced in response to androgens and full-length TSC2 is co-ordinately down-regulated, indicating an androgen-driven switch in TSC2 protein isoforms. In contrast to the well-characterised suppressive effect on cell proliferation of full-length TSC2 protein, both LNCaP and HEK293 cells over-expressing TSC2 isoform A proliferate more rapidly (measured by MTT assays) and have increased levels of cells in S-phase (measured by both Edu staining and FACS analysis).

It is unknown whether the effect of meeting PA guidelines for cancer survivors can impact quality of life following radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer.  Methods:   We reviewed our institutional database of prostate cancer outcomes and included patients that underwent radical prostatectomy and completed the Godin-Shephard Leisure Time Exercise Questionnaire (GLTEQ), the Patient-Oriented Prostate Utility Scale (PORPUS), the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), and the five-item International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF). Participants were categorized as meeting or not meeting the American College of Sports Medicine physical activity guidelines for cancer survivors (150 min of moderate intensity or 75 min of vigorous intensity PA per week). Radical prostatectomy outcomes were measured preoperatively and at 6 and 26-weeks postoperatively.  Results:   From June 2008 to August 2012, 509 men underwent curative, nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer and completed the GLTEQ, of whom 46% met the PA guidelines. Prior to surgery, men that met the PA guidelines reported higher quality of life (p < 0.001) and erectile function (p = 0.049) than men that did not meet the guidelines. Quality of life at all postoperative timepoints was higher for men that met the PA guidelines after adjusting for age, preoperative body mass index, and surgical approach (p = 0.02). Men that met the PA guidelines were 19% less likely to be incontinent at 6 weeks postoperatively (p = 0.028).  Conclusion:   PA volume may be a useful marker at predicting postoperative recovery of quality of life and urinary incontinence following radical prostatectomy.

TPD52 was upregulated in 18/29 (62%) tested cancer types. Strongest expression was found in non-seminoma (56-fold overexpression compared to corresponding normal tissue), seminoma (42-fold), ductal (28-fold) and lobular breast cancer (14-fold). In these tumor types, TPD52 upregulation was found in the vast majority (>80%) of tested samples. Downregulation was found in 11 (38%) tumor types, most strongly in papillary renal cell cancer (-8-fold), leiomyosarcoma (-6-fold), clear cell renal cell cancer (-5-fold), liposarcoma (-5-fold) and lung cancer (-4-fold).

Targeted downregulation of both ADAM-15 and HER2/neu function synergistically kills breast cancer cells, but to date there are no therapeutic options for decreasing ADAM-15 function or expression. In this vein, we have examined a unique string of guanine-rich DNA within the critical core promoter of ADAM-15. This region of DNA consists of seven contiguous runs of three or more consecutive guanines, which, under superhelical stress, can relax from duplex DNA to form an intrastrand secondary G-quadruplex (G4) structure. Using biophysical and biological techniques, we have examined the G4 formation within the entire and various truncated regions of the ADAM-15 promoter, and demonstrate strong intrastrand G4 formation serving to function as a biological silencer element.

Importantly, mechanistic investigation revealed that ROCK endowed cancer cells with tumorigenic capability, mainly by targeting c-Myc. ROCK could increase the transcriptional activity of c-Myc by promoting c-Myc protein stability, and ROCK inhibition reduced c-Myc-mediated expression of mRNA targets (such as HSPC111) and microRNA targets (such as miR-17-92 cluster). We provided evidence demonstrating that ROCK1 directly interacted with and phosphorylated c-Myc, resulting in stabilization of the protein and activation of its transcriptional activity. Suppression of ROCK-c-Myc downstream molecules, such as c-Myc-regulated miR-17, also impaired tumor cell growth in vitro and in vivo. In addition, c-Myc was shown to exert a positive feedback regulation on ROCK by increasing RhoA mRNA expression. Therefore, inhibition of ROCK and its stimulated signaling might prove to be a promising strategy for restraining tumor progression in prostate cancer.""","""['C Zhang', 'S Zhang', 'Z Zhang', 'J He', 'Y Xu', 'S Liu']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['Inhibition of rho-associated kinase signaling prevents breast cancer metastasis to human bone.', 'Quantum dots (QDs) restrain human cervical carcinoma HeLa cell proliferation through inhibition of the ROCK-c-Myc signaling.', 'Antimony enhances c-Myc stability in prostate cancer via activating CtBP2-ROCK1 signaling pathway.', 'Molecular landscape of c-Myc signaling in prostate cancer: A roadmap to clinical translation.', 'Rho-associated kinases in tumorigenesis: re-considering ROCK inhibition for cancer therapy.', 'Mitotic protein kinase-driven crosstalk of machineries for mitosis and metastasis.', 'Rho-Kinase as a Target for Cancer Therapy and Its Immunotherapeutic Potential.', 'Rho-Kinase Inhibitors for the Treatment of Refractory Diabetic Macular Oedema.', 'High expression of miR-17-5p in tumor epithelium is a predictor for poor prognosis for prostate cancer patients.', 'mRNA and miRNA Expression Analyses of the MYC/E2F/miR-17-92 Network in the Most Common Pediatric Brain Tumors.']"""

Document architecture for specimen management and the exchange of specimen collection protocols between biobanking information systems""","""Background:   The integrity of collection protocols in biobanking is essential for a high-quality sample preparation process. However, there is not currently a well-defined universal method for integrating collection protocols in the biobanking information system (BIMS). Therefore, an electronic schema of the collection protocol that is based on Extensible Markup Language (XML) is required to maintain the integrity and enable the exchange of collection protocols.  Materials and methods:   The development and implementation of an electronic specimen collection protocol schema (eSCPS) was performed at two institutions (Muenster and Cologne) in three stages. First, we analyzed the infrastructure that was already established at both the biorepository and the hospital information systems of these institutions and determined the requirements for the sufficient preparation of specimens and documentation. Second, we designed an eSCPS according to these requirements. Finally, a prospective study was conducted to implement and evaluate the novel schema in the current BIMS.  Results:   We designed an eSCPS that provides all of the relevant information about collection protocols. Ten electronic collection protocols were generated using the supplementary Protocol Editor tool, and these protocols were successfully implemented in the existing BIMS. Moreover, an electronic list of collection protocols for the current studies being performed at each institution was included, new collection protocols were added, and the existing protocols were redesigned to be modifiable. The documentation time was significantly reduced after implementing the eSCPS (5 ± 2 min vs. 7 ± 3 min; p = 0.0002).  Conclusion:   The eSCPS improves the integrity and facilitates the exchange of specimen collection protocols in the existing open-source BIMS.""","""['O Eminaga', 'A Semjonow', 'E Oezguer', 'J Herden', 'I Akbarov', 'A Tok', 'U Engelmann', 'S Wille']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Methods Inf Med""","""['Utilization of Mobile Application for Better Implementation of Good Clinical Practice in a Biorepository Sample Collection Process: Functions of PancMoBio in Biobanking.', 'The biorepository portal toolkit: an honest brokered, modular service oriented software tool set for biospecimen-driven translational research.', 'Web-based infectious disease reporting using XML forms.', 'Biological sample collection, processing, storage and information management.', 'Biobanking of CSF: international standardization to optimize biomarker development.', 'BioSCOOP - Biobank Sample Communication Protocol.

In the present study, we showed that miR-200b was downregulated in clinical prostatic tumors when compared to normal prostate tissue and in advanced PCa cell lines when compared to normal epithelial prostatic cells. Enforced miR-200b expression suppressed PCa cell proliferation and migration and enhanced chemosensitivity to docetaxel by targeting B-cell-specific Moloney murine leukemia virus insertion site 1 (Bmi-1). Bmi-1 was detected at higher levels in PCa, and knockdown of Bmi-1 showed similar effects as miR-200b overexpression in PCa cells. Moreover, we confirmed that these effects were correlated with increased levels of E-cadherin and P16 and a reduction in vimentin expression and expression of stem cell markers (CD44 and OCT4).

Patients and methods:   Between September 2008 and March 2013, 25 patients with local recurrence of previously irradiated prostate cancer were treated. The main eligibility criteria for salvage prostate HDR brachytherapy combined with interstitial hyperthermia were biopsy confirmed local recurrence and absence of nodal and distant metastases. All patients were treated with a dose of 30 Gy in 3 fractions at 21-day intervals. We performed 62 hyperthermia procedures out of 75 planned (83 %). The aim of the hyperthermia treatment was to heat the prostate to 41-43 °C for 60 min. Toxicity for the organs of the genitourinary system and rectum was assessed according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, v. 4.03). Determination of subsequent biochemical failure was based on the Phoenix definition (nadir + 2 ng/ml).  Results:   The median age was 71 years (range 62-83 years), the median initial PSA level was 16.3 ng/ml (range 6.37-64 ng/ml), and the median salvage PSA level was 2.8 ng/ml (1.044-25.346 ng/ml). The median follow-up was 13 months (range 4-48 months). The combination of HDR brachytherapy and IHT was well tolerated. The most frequent complications were nocturia, weak urine stream, urinary frequency, hematuria, and urgency. Grade 2 rectal hemorrhage was observed in 1 patient. No grade 3 or higher complications were observed. The 2-year Kaplan-Meier estimate of biochemical control after salvage treatment was 74 %. The PSA in 20 patients decreased below the presalvage level, while 11 patients achieved a PSA nadir < 0.5 ng/ml. All patients are still alive. Of the 7 patients who experienced biochemical failure, bone metastases were found in 2 patients.

Transanal minimally invasive surgery allows the surgeon to mobilize the most distal part of the rectum by using a single port positioned in the anal canal.  Objective:   We aim to assess the safety and feasibility of transanal rectal excision.  Design and setting:   This pilot study was conducted in a university hospital and tertiary colorectal referral center in Belgium.  Patients:   Over a 12-month period, all consecutive patients with benign disease and ASA grade 3 patients with a rectal carcinoma who required either intersphincteric proctectomy or coloanal anastomosis were included.  Intervention:   After intersphincteric dissection or sleeve mucosectomy, a single-access multichannel port was inserted into the anal canal. A transanal rectal excision was performed by using conventional laparoscopic instruments. The planes were developed as cephalad as possible, until the pouch of Douglas was opened. A laparoscopically assisted approach was used to gain bowel length and was used in patients who required proctectomy. In the case of a reconstruction, a handsewn coloanal anastomosis was made.  Main outcome measures:   Intraoperative challenges, conversion rate, operating time, blood loss, morbidity, and length of stay were assessed.  Results:   Fourteen patients underwent a transanal rectal excision for both benign (9) and malignant (5) disease. In 11 patients (79%), laparoscopically assisted transanal minimally invasive rectal excision was performed. The median (range) transanal operating time was 55 (35-95) minutes. Intraoperative difficulties hindering dissection occurred in 5 patients and were due to inadequate exposure, rectal perforation, or fibrosis secondary to radiotherapy for prostate cancer. There was minimal postoperative morbidity, with a median follow-up of 6.3 (1.5-13.8) months. All patients were discharged within 14 days postoperatively, and there were no readmissions.  Limitations:   The study was limited by the small number of patients.  Conclusion:   Transanal rectal excision is safe and feasible and could be a promising technique to facilitate distal rectal mobilization (see Video, Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/DCR/A125).""","""['Albert M Wolthuis', 'Anthony de Buck van Overstraeten', ""André D'Hoore""]""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Dis Colon Rectum""","""['Transanal endoscopic total mesorectal excision combined with single-port laparoscopy.', 'Robotic coloanal anastomosis with or without intersphincteric resection for low rectal cancer: starting with the perianal approach followed by robotic procedure.', 'Robotic-assisted laparoscopic transanal total mesorectal excision for rectal cancer: a prospective pilot study.', 'Postoperative and long-term outcomes after redo surgery for failed colorectal or coloanal anastomosis: retrospective analysis of 50 patients and review of the literature.', 'Transanal minimally invasive surgery for total mesorectal excision.', 'TAMIS is a valuable alternative to TEM for resection of intraluminal rectal tumors.', 'Feasibility of transanal total mesorectal excision in cases with challenging patient and tumor characteristics.', 'Transanal Total Mesorectal Excision: A Novel Approach to Rectal Surgery.', 'True NOTES TME resection with splenic flexure release, high ligation of IMA, and side-to-end hand-sewn coloanal anastomosis.', 'Transanal total mesorectal excision: Towards standardization of technique.']"""

After identifying their molecular and functional stem-like characteristics, stem-like SP cells from a cell line and from xenograft tissue were transfected with hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α). The potential of the prostate stem-like SP cells to undergo EMT was compared with that in their bulk counterparts after HIF-1α introduction. Stem-like SP cells acquired more complete EMT molecular features and exhibited stronger aggressive capability than the homologous bulk population cells both in vitro (proliferation and invasion) and in vivo (tumorigenesis and metastasis formation). We, therefore, concluded that EMT is closely associated with tumor heterogeneity, and that PCa cells susceptible to EMT are enriched in stem-like SP cells.

Logistic regression adjusted for age at blood draw, study center, pack-years of smoking, and sex was used to estimate odd ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using study- and sex-specific methylation quartiles.

The key focus of this study was the discovery and development of a potential agent for this disease.  Materials and methods:   Several pharmacological and biochemical assays were used to characterize the apoptotic signaling pathways of moniliformediquinone, a natural product, in hormone refractory metastatic prostate cancer.  Results:   Moniliformediquinone induced cell cycle arrest at the S-phase and subsequent apoptosis in the hormone refractory metastatic prostate cancer cell lines PC-3 and DU-145. Further examination showed that moniliformediquinone induced a DNA damage response associated with Chk1, Chk2, c-Jun and JNK activation. Mitochondrial apoptosis pathways were also activated, including loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, cytochrome c release, and activation of caspase-9 and 3. The antioxidant and glutathione precursor N-acetylcysteine, and the antioxidant Trolox™ completely abolished moniliformediquinone induced generation of reactive oxygen species. However, N-acetylcysteine but not Trolox blocked moniliformediquinone mediated apoptosis and related signaling cascades. Further identification showed that moniliformediquinone alone did not conjugate glutathione but significantly decreased cellular glutathione levels. The in vivo study revealed that moniliformediquinone completely inhibited tumor growth with no weight loss.  Conclusions:   Our data suggest that moniliformediquinone is a potential anticancer agent for hormone refractory metastatic prostate cancer by decreasing cellular glutathione, leading to a DNA damage response and cell cycle arrest at the S-phase. Mitochondrial stress also occurs due to moniliformediquinone action through loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and cytochrome c release, which in turn induce the activation of caspase cascades and apoptotic cell death.""","""['Jui-Ling Hsu', 'Yean-Jang Lee', 'Wohn-Jenn Leu', 'Yu-Shun Dong', 'Shiow-Lin Pan', 'Biing-Jiun Uang', 'Jih-Hwa Guh']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Repurposing of phentolamine as a potential anticancer agent against human castration-resistant prostate cancer: A central role on microtubule stabilization and mitochondrial apoptosis pathway.', 'Ardisianone, a natural benzoquinone, efficiently induces apoptosis in human hormone-refractory prostate cancers through mitochondrial damage stress and survivin downregulation.', 'Tumor apoptosis induced by epoxide-containing piperazines, a new class of anti-cancer agents.', 'GSH extrusion and and the mitochondrial pathway of apoptotic signalling.', 'Methyl jasmonate: putative mechanisms of action on cancer cells cycle, metabolism, and apoptosis.', 'Molecular Basis of Prostate Cancer and Natural Products as Potential Chemotherapeutic and Chemopreventive Agents.', 'Dendrobium: Sources of Active Ingredients to Treat Age-Related Pathologies.', 'Moniliformediquinone as a potential therapeutic agent, inactivation of hepatic stellate cell and inhibition of liver fibrosis in vivo.', 'Symbiotic in vitro seed propagation of Dendrobium: fungal and bacterial partners and their influence on plant growth and development.']"""

Each set comprised at least 14 cores with 2 or more from the transition zone. Of these men 53 underwent radical prostatectomy.  Results:   Patients with tumors in the peripheral zone as well as the transition zone had a higher maximum Gleason score and an increased maximum percent of cancer per core than men with tumor in the peripheral or transition zone only. In 12 of the 534 patients (2.2%) the tumor on active surveillance biopsy was limited to transition zone core(s). Of the 534 patients 11 (2.1%) had tumor with a high Gleason score (greater than 6) or extensive involvement (greater than 50%) of any core exclusively on transition zone biopsy. However, in 10 of 15 radical prostatectomy cases (66.7%) with prior positive transition zone biopsies the tumors had little or no transition zone component. In addition, transition zone status on biopsy had no significant relationship with Gleason score, extraprostatic extension or seminal vesicle involvement at radical prostatectomy.

Results:   Of 267 patients subjected to prostate biopsy, 73 (27.3%) patients were diagnosed with CHPI. Comparing CHPI with PCa patients, %p2PSA and PHI were found to be significantly lower, whereas fPSA and %fPSA were significantly higher. %p2PSA and PHI were the most accurate predictors of CHPI at biopsy, significantly outperforming tPSA, fPSA, and %fPSA.

NADT before CRYO has sometimes been used for prostate volume reduction, with some theoretical benefit toward improving disease control. NADT has been shown to be beneficial for biochemical disease-free survival (bDFS) with radiotherapy but not in conjunction with radical prostatectomy.  Methods:   We retrospectively compared risk-stratified cohorts according to whether they had received NADT. bDFS was defined using the Phoenix criteria, and postoperative morbidity and complications were compared.  Results:   A total of 1761 men had undergone NADT before CRYO and 2727 had not. No differences were found in the incidence of postoperative incontinence, pad use, potency, or fistula formation. The rate of urinary retention at 12 months was slightly lower for those who had not undergone NADT (0.8% vs 1.2%, P = .015). No difference was found in bDFS between the NADT and non-NADT men (66.9% vs 66.5% at 5 years). When stratified by risk, however, a statistically significant difference was found between the NADT and non-NADT men only in the intermediate-risk cohort (71.3% vs 65.9%; P < .013).  Conclusion:   bDFS was statistically similar between the NADT and non-NADT men, except in the intermediate-risk cohort, with slightly improved survival for those undergoing NADT.

Methods:   The prostate cancer database of Cleveland Clinic includes 3600 patients who have undergone prostate brachytherapy and 2500 patients who have undergone EBRT. We cross-referenced these patients with the electronic medical record to identify patients who required PVP or TURP after radiation. The primary outcome was the need for any further intervention after PVP or TURP, including bladder neck incision, repeat TURP, or permanent supravesicular diversion.  Results:   Sixty of the 3600 patients (1.7%) required prostate reduction surgery after brachytherapy. Of these 60 patients, 19 of 40 (47.5%) who underwent TURP required further intervention, and 10 of 20 patients (50%) who underwent PVP required subsequent intervention. Twenty-eight of the 2500 patients (1.1%) required prostate reduction surgery after EBRT. Of these 28 patients, 5 of 18 patients (27.8%) who underwent TURP required further intervention, and 5 of 10 patients (50%) who underwent PVP required subsequent intervention. Following either type of radiation there was not a significant difference in the need for further treatment based on the type of surgery (P >.999 for brachytherapy; P = .412 for EBRT). The median time between radiation and prostate reduction surgery is 20.2 months (range, 14.6-27.6) after brachytherapy and 53.3 months (range, 27.5-53.3) after EBRT (P = .0005).

The GR agonist dexamethasone was sufficient to confer enzalutamide resistance, whereas a GR antagonist restored sensitivity.

We determined whether a methylation inhibitor quercetin (Q) will enhance the chemoprevention of prostate cancer in vivo. Androgen-sensitive LAPC-4 prostate cancer cells were injected subcutaneously into severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice one week before the intervention. The concentration of GTPs in brewed tea administered as drinking water was 0.07% and Q was supplemented in diet at 0.2% or 0.4%. After 6-weeks of intervention tumor growth was inhibited by 3% (0.2% Q), 15% (0.4% Q), 21% (GT), 28% (GT+0.2% Q) and 45% (GT+0.4% Q) compared to control. The concentration of non-methylated GTPs was significantly increased in tumor tissue with GT+0.4% Q treatment compared to GT alone, and was associated with a decreased protein expression of catechol-O-methyltransferase and multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP)-1.

EUROCARE-the largest cooperative study of population-based cancer survival in Europe-has shown persistent differences between countries for cancer survival, although in general, cancer survival is improving. Major changes in cancer diagnosis, treatment, and rehabilitation occurred in the early 2000s. EUROCARE-5 assesses their effect on cancer survival in 29 European countries.  Methods:   In this retrospective observational study, we analysed data from 107 cancer registries for more than 10 million patients with cancer diagnosed up to 2007 and followed up to 2008. Uniform quality control procedures were applied to all datasets. For patients diagnosed 2000-07, we calculated 5-year relative survival for 46 cancers weighted by age and country. We also calculated country-specific and age-specific survival for ten common cancers, together with survival differences between time periods (for 1999-2001, 2002-04, and 2005-07).  Findings:   5-year relative survival generally increased steadily over time for all European regions. The largest increases from 1999-2001 to 2005-07 were for prostate cancer (73.4% [95% CI 72.9-73.9] vs 81.7% [81.3-82.1]), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (53.8% [53.3-54.4] vs 60.4% [60.0-60.9]), and rectal cancer (52.1% [51.6-52.6] vs 57.6% [57.1-58.1]). Survival in eastern Europe was generally low and below the European mean, particularly for cancers with good or intermediate prognosis. Survival was highest for northern, central, and southern Europe. Survival in the UK and Ireland was intermediate for rectal cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer, skin melanoma, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, but low for kidney, stomach, ovarian, colon, and lung cancers. Survival for lung cancer in the UK and Ireland was much lower than for other regions for all periods, although results for lung cancer in some regions (central and eastern Europe) might be affected by overestimation. Survival usually decreased with age, although to different degrees depending on region and cancer type.  Interpretation:   The major advances in cancer management that occurred up to 2007 seem to have resulted in improved survival in Europe. Likely explanations of differences in survival between countries include: differences in stage at diagnosis and accessibility to good care, different diagnostic intensity and screening approaches, and differences in cancer biology. Variations in socioeconomic, lifestyle, and general health between populations might also have a role. Further studies are needed to fully interpret these findings and how to remedy disparities.

Patients and methods:   We retrospectively reviewed the records of 1213 men who underwent transrectal ultrasonography-guided prostate biopsy at our institution. Biopsy outcomes were analysed with respect to various variables, including patient age, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), prostate volume, digital rectal examination (DRE) findings and obesity, defined as BMI ≥25 kg/m(2) , an Asian BMI category.  Results:   Among 1213 men, 408 (33.6%) were obese and 344 (28.4%) had a positive biopsy. Obese men were younger (65.5 vs 67.1 years, P = 0.003), had a larger prostate (49.2 vs 42.9 mL, P < 0.001) and were less likely to have any abnormality on DRE (8.1 vs 15.9% P < 0.001) than non-obese men. In the multivariate analysis, obesity was significantly associated with a higher risk of prostate cancer detection in men undergoing biopsy (odds ratio [OR] = 1.446, P = 0.024). In addition, obesity was significantly associated with a higher rate of biopsy-detected high grade (Gleason score ≥4 + 3) disease, and this association remained after multivariate adjustment (OR = 1.498, P = 0.039).

The patients were instructed to take magnesium oxide tablets during radiotherapy. They were also encouraged to avoid foods that might cause intestinal gas during radiotherapy. Gas accumulation in the rectum was graded into three classes by the same radiation oncologist. If no gas was seen in the rectum, it was classified as grade 0. A small amount of gas was classified as grade 1, whereas a marked amount of gas that required removal was classified as grade 2.  Results:   Of the 2042 sets of MV images, grades 1 and 2 gas accumulation were seen in 332 (16%) and 156 (8%), respectively. By the trend test, gas accumulation significantly decreased towards the end of treatment (P = 0.02 for grade 1 or 2 and P = 0.02 for grade 2).

Patients and methods:   The study entry criteria were biopsy-proven prostate cancer, a positive WBS consistent with bone metastases, and no history of androgen deprivation. Within 30 days of informed consent, trial scans were performed in random order. Scans were interpreted blindly for the purpose of a lesion-based analysis. The primary target variable was bone lesion (malignant/benign) and the 'gold standard' was MRI.  Results:   A total of 50 men were recruited between May 2009 and March 2012. Their mean age was 73 years, their median PSA level was 84 ng/mL, and the mean Gleason score of the tumours was 7.7. A total of 46 patients underwent all four scans, while four missed one PET/CT scan. A total of 526 bone lesions were found in the 50 men: 363 malignant and 163 non-malignant according to MRI.

To date, the CellSearch system is the only US Food and Drug Administration-approved CTC enumeration system for advanced breast, prostate, and colon cancers. However, sensitivity issues due to epithelial cellular adhesion molecule (EpCAM)-based enrichment and limited capability for subsequent molecular analysis must be addressed before CTCs can be used as predictive markers in the clinical setting. We have developed a multicolor CTC detection system using cross-contamination-free flow cytometry, which permits the enumeration and characterization of CTCs for multiple molecular analyses. Tumor cell lines with different expression levels of EpCAM were spiked into peripheral blood obtained from healthy donors. Spike-in samples were negatively enriched using anti-CD45-coated magnetic beads to remove white blood cells, and this was followed by fixation and labeling with CD45-Alexa Fluor 700, EpCAM-phycoerythrin, cytokeratin (CK)-fluorescein isothiocyanate antibodies, and/or 7-aminoactinomycin D for nuclei staining. Excellent detection (slope = 0.760-0.888) and a linear performance (R(2) = 0.994-0.998) were noted between the observed and expected numbers of tumor cells, independent of EpCAM expression.

The successful examples of immunoprophylaxis and therapy against cancers include: (i) targeted therapy using monoclonal antibodies (Nat Rev Cancer 12:278-287, 2012); (ii) allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantion to elicit graft-versus-cancer effect against a variety of hematopoietic malignancies (Blood 112:4371-4383, 2008); (iii) vaccination for preventing cancers with clear viral etiology such as hepatocellular carcinoma and cervical cancer (Cancer J Clin 57:7-28, 2007; NEJM 336:1855-1859, 1997); (iv) T cell checkpoint blockade against inhibitory pathways including targeting CTLA-4 and PD-1 inhibitory molecules for the treatment of melanoma and other solid tumors (NEJM 363:711-723, 2010; NEJM 366:2443-2454, 2012; NEJM 369:122-133, 2013; NEJM 366:2455-2465, 2012); (v) antigen-pulsed autologous dendritic cell vaccination against prostate cancer (NEJM 363:411-422, 2010); and (vi) the transfer of T cells including those genetically engineered with chimeric antigen receptors allowing targeting of B cell neoplasms (NEJM 365:725-733, 2011; NEJM 368:1509-1518, 2013; Blood 118:4817-4828, 2013; Sci Transl Med 5:177ra138, 2013).This article provides an overview on the exciting and expanding immunological arsenals against cancer, and discusses critical remaining unanswered questions of cancer immunology.

To characterize the putative role of HOXB13 in cell cycle progression, we performed overexpression and siRNA-mediated knockdown studies in PC-3 and LNCaP cells. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) analyses were also performed using formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues containing normal, H-PIN and PCa sections from 20 radical prostatectomy specimens. Furthermore, when the role of HOXB13 during cell cycle progression, association with cyclins, cell growth and colony formation using real-time cell proliferation were assessed, we observed that ectopic expression of HOXB13 accumulated cells at G1 through decreasing the cyclin D1 level by promoting its ubiquitination and degradation. This loss slowed S phase entry in both cell lines examined, with an associated decrease in pRb((S780) and (S795)) phosphorylations. Contrary, siRNA-mediated depletion of HOXB13 expression noticeably increased cyclin levels, stabilized E2F1 and CDC25C, subsequent to increased pRb phosphorylations. This increase in Cyclin B1 and CDC25C both together facilitated activation of cyclin B complex via dephosphorylating CDK1((T14Y15)), and resumed the G2/M transition after nocodazole synchronization. Despite an increase in the total expression level and cytoplasmic retention of HOXB13 in H-PIN and PCa samples that were observed via IHC evaluation of prostate tissues, HOXB13 depletion facilitated to an increase in PC-3 and LNCaP cell proliferation.

Tumor-penetrating peptides (TPP) are a series of targeting peptides with the function of penetrating tumor blood vessels and tumor stroma. This work aimed to improve the penetration of liposomes in tumor tissues by TPP modification, thereby enhancing the antitumor effect. First, RPARPAR, a TPP, was modified to the surface of liposomes loaded with doxorubicin. The RPARPAR-modified liposomes (RPA-LP) and unmodified liposomes (LP) showed spherical morphology with average sizes about 90 nm. RPA-LP exhibited remarkably increased cellular accumulation by PC-3 tumor cells than LP as evidenced by the cellular uptake test. The in vivo imaging study confirmed that RPARPAR modification significantly increased the liposome accumulation in subcutaneous tumor tissues. RPA-LP could penetrate through tumor blood vessels and tumor stroma and into the deep tumor tissues as evidence by the immunofluorescence staining analysis. The cytotoxicity of RPARPAR-modified doxorubicin liposomes (RPA-LP-DXR) is considerably increased compared with that of doxorubicin liposomes (LP-DXR). The RPA-LP-DXR also showed significantly (p < 0.005) stronger growth-inhibiting effect on tumor than LP-DXR, possibly due to the tumor-penetrating ability of RPA-LP and targeted killing of tumor cells. This study proved that TPP mediation may be an effective strategy for improving the transport of liposomes in tumor tissue.""","""['Zhiqiang Yan', 'Yiyi Yang', 'Xiaoli Wei', 'Jian Zhong', 'Daixu Wei', 'Lu Liu', 'Cao Xie', 'Fei Wang', 'Lin Zhang', 'Weiyue Lu', 'Dannong He']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Mol Pharm""","""['A novel peptide probe for imaging and targeted delivery of liposomal doxorubicin to lung tumor.', 'Tumor-penetrating peptide functionalization enhances the anti-glioblastoma effect of doxorubicin liposomes.', 'Chloride channel-mediated brain glioma targeting of chlorotoxin-modified doxorubicine-loaded liposomes.', 'Tumor targeting of doxorubicin by anti-MT1-MMP antibody-modified PEG liposomes.', 'Liposomes for Enhanced Cellular Uptake of Anticancer Agents.', 'Digesting a Path Forward: The Utility of Collagenase Tumor Treatment for Improved Drug Delivery.', 'Pharmacokinetics, distribution and anti-tumor efficacy of liposomal mitoxantrone modified with a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone receptor-specific peptide.', 'Tumor-targeting peptides from combinatorial libraries.', 'Strategies for improving the intratumoral distribution of liposomal drugs in cancer therapy.']"""

In the current report, we backcrossed this strain to the Lewis strain, an inbred rat strain better characterized for immunological analyses. We demonstrate that Lewis transgenic rats (Lew-TRAP) developed prostate adenocarcinomas with 100% penetrance by 25 weeks of age.

Patients and methods:   We examined 117 consecutive patients with prostate cancer who underwent IG-IMRT from June 2007 to July 2009. The median follow-up time was 32 months (range 20-42 months). The clinical target volume (CTV) consisted of the prostate and seminal vesicles, and the planning target volume (PTV) consisted of the CTV plus a 5-mm expansion, not avoiding the rectum. The PTV received a dose of 72.6-74.8 Gy in 33-34 fractions (2.2 Gy/fraction). Megavoltage computed tomographic (MVCT) scans were performed before each treatment and corrected to the registered position for planning CT scans using prostate soft tissue matching.  Results:   Late rectal bleeding of grades 1, 2, and 3 (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v3.0) occurred in 19 (16%), five (4%), and four (3%) patients, respectively. Late urinary toxicities of grades 1 and 2 occurred in five (4.3%) and eight (6.8%) patients, respectively.

Thus, developing molecular markers of small cell differentiation in prostate cancer will be important to guide the diagnosis and therapy of this aggressive tumor.  Experimental design:   We examined the status of RB1, TP53, and PTEN in prostatic small cell and acinar carcinomas via immunohistochemistry (IHC), copy-number alteration analysis, and sequencing of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded specimens.  Results:   We found retinoblastoma (Rb) protein loss in 90% of small cell carcinoma cases (26 of 29) with RB1 allelic loss in 85% of cases (11 of 13). Of acinar tumors occurring concurrently with prostatic small cell carcinoma, 43% (3 of 7) showed Rb protein loss. In contrast, only 7% of primary high-grade acinar carcinomas (10 of 150), 11% of primary acinar carcinomas with neuroendocrine differentiation (4 of 35), and 15% of metastatic castrate-resistant acinar carcinomas (2 of 13) showed Rb protein loss. Loss of PTEN protein was seen in 63% of small cell carcinomas (17 of 27), with 38% (5 of 13) showing allelic loss. By IHC, accumulation of p53 was observed in 56% of small cell carcinomas (14 of 25), with 60% of cases (6 of 10) showing TP53 mutation.  Conclusions:   Loss of RB1 by deletion is a common event in prostatic small cell carcinoma and can be detected by a validated IHC assay.

The failure to completely ablate tissue androgens may limit suppression of PCa growth. We evaluated combinations of CYP17A and 5-α-reductase inhibitors for reducing prostate androgen levels, AR signaling, and PCa volumes.  Patients and methods:   Thirty-five men with intermediate/high-risk clinically localized PCa were randomly assigned to goserelin combined with dutasteride (ZD), bicalutamide and dutasteride (ZBD), or bicalutamide, dutasteride, and ketoconazole (ZBDK) for 3 months before prostatectomy. Controls included patients receiving combined androgen blockade with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist and bicalutamide. The primary outcome measure was tissue dihydrotestosterone (DHT) concentration.  Results:   Prostate DHT levels were substantially lower in all experimental arms (0.02 to 0.04 ng/g v 0.92 ng/g in controls; P < .001). The ZBDK group demonstrated the greatest percentage decline in serum testosterone, androsterone, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (P < .05 for all). Staining for AR and the androgen-regulated genes prostate-specific antigen and TMPRSS2 was strongly suppressed in benign glands and moderately in malignant glands (P < .05 for all). Two patients had pathologic complete response, and nine had ≤ 0.2 cm(3) of residual tumor (defined as a near-complete response), with the largest numbers of complete and near-complete responses in the ZBDK group.

Methods:   We conducted 3 sets of logistic regression analyses employing 2000-2010 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey data: 1 cross-sectional and 2 prospective (baseline preventive care/follow-up year satisfaction, and baseline satisfaction/follow-up year preventive care), each set cumulatively adjusting for patient demographics, socioeconomics, morbidity, health care access, and medical skepticism.

Using three independent assays, we demonstrate that maternal HFD is sufficient to initiate prostate hyperproliferation in adult male offspring. HFD-exposed prostate tissues do not increase in size, but instead concomitantly up-regulate apoptosis. Maternal HFD-induced phenotypes are focally present in young adult subjects and greatly exacerbated in aged subjects.

Here, we reported that apoptosis is not the sole mechanism by which RD inhibits tumor cell growth because low concentrations of RD caused cellular senescence in prostate cancer (PCa) cells.  Methods:   Low concentrations of RD were used to treat PCa cells in vitro and in vivo, and senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity, DNA damage response markers, and/or colony-forming ability, cell cycle were analyzed, respectively. We then used siRNA knockdown to identify key factor in RD-triggered cellular senescence.  Results:   RD treatment caused growth arrest at G0/G1 phase with features of cellular senescence phenotype such as enlarged and flattened morphology, increased senescence-associated-beta-galactosidase staining cells, and decreased cell proliferation in PCa cells. Induction of cellular senescence by RD occurred through activation of DNA damage response including increases in the phosphor-H2AX, inactivation of Chk1/2, and suppression of repair-related Ku70/86 and phosphor-BRCA1 in PCa cells in vitro and in vivo. Analysis of expression levels of p53, p21(CIP1), p16(INK4a), p27(KIP1), pRb and E2F1 and genetic knockdown of p21(CIP1) demonstrated an important role of p21(CIP1) in RD-triggered cellular senescence.

Methods and materials:   Patients in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare database diagnosed with prostate cancer from 2004 to 2007 were included. Prostate specific antigen (PSA), Gleason score, and clinical T stage were used to define D'Amico risk categories.

In patients who underwent bone scans, we report use of bone-specific x-ray, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, and bone biopsy within 3 months after bone scan. Costs were estimated using 2012 Medicare reimbursement rates.  Results:   In all, 31% and 48% of patients with apparent low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancer underwent a bone scan; of these patients, 21% underwent subsequent x-rays, 7% CT, and 3% MRI scans. Bone biopsies were uncommon. Overall, <1% of low- and intermediate-risk patients were found to have metastatic disease. The annual estimated Medicare cost for bone scans and downstream procedures was $11,300,000 for low- and intermediate-risk patients. For patients with apparent high-risk disease, only 62% received a bone scan, of whom 14% were found to have metastasis.

Our objective is to characterize the outcomes and optimal timing of early vs. delayed ART.  Materials and methods:   From the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results-Medicare data from 1995 to 2007, we identified 963 men with pT3N0 disease receiving early (<4 mo after RP, n = 419) vs. delayed (4-12 mo after RP, n = 544) ART after RP. Utilizing propensity score methods, we compared overall mortality, prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM), bone-related events (BRE), salvage hormonal therapy utilization, and intervention for urethral stricture. We then used the maximal statistic approach to determine at what time post-RP ART had the most significant effect on outcomes of interest in men with pT3N0 disease.  Results:   When compared with delayed ART in men with pT3 disease, early ART was associated with improved PCSM (0.47 vs. 1.02 events per 100 person-years; P = 0.038) and less salvage hormonal therapy (2.88 vs. 4.59 events per 100 person-years; P = 0.001). Delaying ART beyond 5 months is associated with worse PCSM (hazard ratio [HR] 2.3; P = 0.020), beyond 3 months is associated with more BRE (HR 1.6; P = 0.025), and beyond 4 months is associated higher rates of salvage hormonal therapy (HR 1.6; P = 0.002). ART performed after 9 months was associated with fewer urethral strictures (HR 0.6; P = 0.042).  Conclusion:   Initiating ART less than 5 months after RP for pT3 is associated with improved PCSM. Early ART is also associated with fewer BRE and less use of salvage hormonal therapy if administered earlier than 3 and 4 months after RP, respectively. However, ART administered later than 9 months after RP is associated with fewer urethral strictures.

While genomic tests will offer many potential opportunities to improve the delivery of care, including the potential for genomic research to offer opportunities to improve prostate cancer screening and treatment, such advances do not in themselves constitute a paradigm shift in the delivery of health care. Rather, personalized medicine is based on a partnership between clinician and patient that utilizes shared decision making to determine the best health care options among the available choices, weighing the patient's personal values and preferences together with clinical findings. This approach is particularly important for difficult clinical decisions involving uncertainty and trade-offs, such as those involved in prostate cancer screening and management.

Methods:   A cross-sectional survey of male family practice attendees aged 40 years or older, with no previous history of prostate cancer, between June 2010 and November 2011. Questions related to whether participants had undertaken PSA testing or discussed this with their doctor over the past 5 years, whether the patient or doctor had initiated the discussion, reasons for undergoing testing, and whether their doctor had discussed particular risks associated with PSA testing.  Results:   Sixty-seven percent (215/320) of men recalled having a PSA test in the past five years. Of the respondents who reported not having a test, 14% had discussed it with their doctor. The main reasons for having a PSA test were doctor recommendation and wanting to keep up to date with health tests. Thirty-eight percent or fewer respondents reported being advised of each potential risk.  Conclusions:   Despite debate over the benefits of routine PSA testing, a high proportion of male family practice attendees report undertaking this test. Risks associated with testing appear to be poorly disclosed by general practitioners.

This study evaluated the potential clinical utility of the CCP test in a US-based clinical setting.  Methods:   Urologists who participated in a prospective clinical study were sent a retrospective questionnaire to assess the value of the CCP test result. Fifteen board-certified urologists participated in the study, representing 15 distinct community urology group practices. Questionnaires were received for 294 evaluable patients. All patients had localized prostate cancer (T1-T3b, N0, M0).  Results:   Physicians found the CCP score valuable and indicated that 55% of tests generated a mortality risk that was either higher or lower than expected. Physicians also indicated that 32% of test results would lead to a definite or possible change in treatment. The data suggest that the test would have the net effect of shifting patients from more aggressive treatment to more conservative treatment. This was evidenced by the significant association between change in treatment and lower CCP scores (p < 0.002) and by the fact that 62% of tests likely to lead to a definite or possible change in treatment had mortality risks lower than the physician expected versus only 10% with risks higher than expected.  Study limitations:   This study measured the retrospectively assessed likelihood of change in treatment as estimated by the physician, not the actual change in treatment.  Conclusions:   The CCP score adds meaningful new information to risk assessment for localized prostate cancer patients. Real-world use of the test is likely to lead to a change in treatment in a significant portion of tested patients, particularly by shifting patients towards more conservative management.

This work analyses five year results of IMRT with a dose of 78/82 Gy.  Patients and methods:   From June 2003 to December 2007, the IMRT technique was employed to treat 233 patients with T1-3 N0 M0 prostate cancer. It was supplemented by hormone therapy especially in high-risk patients. Two IMRT techniques were applied - IMRT with a dose of 78 Gy in 39 fractions to prostate and seminal vesicles (SV) (IMRT 78) and IMRT with simultaneous integrated 82 Gy boost to prostate concurrently with 73,8 Gy in 41 fractions to SV (IMRT SIB 82). The IMRT 78 technique was used in 160 patients (69%). Seventy-three (31%) patients with intermediate (IR) or high-risk (HR) prostate cancer without SV involvement were treated with IMRT SIB 82 technique. The PSA relapse was defined as an increase in PSA of at least 2.0 ng/mL above the nadir or in comparison to the value at the initiation of hormone therapy. Clinical relapse was defined as an occurence of distant metastases and/or local recurrence.  Results:   The median follow-up of our patients´ population was 4.3 years (range 0.6-8.9 years).

This paper presents an algorithm for the prostate gland volume estimation based on the semiautomated segmentation of individual slices in T2-weighted MR and CT image sequences.  Methods:   The proposed Inter-Slice Bidirectional Registration-based Segmentation (iBRS) algorithm relies on interslice image registration of volume data to segment the prostate gland without the use of an anatomical atlas. It requires the user to mark only three slices in a given volume dataset, i.e., the first, middle, and last slices. Next, the proposed algorithm uses a registration algorithm to autosegment the remaining slices. We conducted comprehensive experiments to measure the performance of the proposed algorithm using three registration methods (i.e., rigid, affine, and nonrigid techniques).  Results:   The results with the proposed technique were compared with manual marking using prostate MR and CT images from 117 patients. Manual marking was performed by an expert user for all 117 patients. The median accuracies for individual slices measured using the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) were 92% and 91% for MR and CT images, respectively. The iBRS algorithm was also evaluated regarding user variability, which confirmed that the algorithm was robust to interuser variability when marking the prostate gland.  Conclusions:   The proposed algorithm exploits the interslice data redundancy of the images in a volume dataset of MR and CT images and eliminates the need for an atlas, minimizing the computational cost while producing highly accurate results which are robust to interuser variability.""","""['Farzad Khalvati', 'Aryan Salmanpour', 'Shahryar Rahnamayan', 'George Rodrigues', 'Hamid R Tizhoosh']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Sequential Registration-Based Segmentation of the Prostate Gland in MR Image Volumes.', 'Spatially varying accuracy and reproducibility of prostate segmentation in magnetic resonance images using manual and semiautomated methods.', 'Narrow band deformable registration of prostate magnetic resonance imaging, magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging, and computed tomography studies.', 'Investigation and benchmarking of U-Nets on prostate segmentation tasks.', 'Quick guide on radiology image pre-processing for deep learning applications in prostate cancer research.', 'Semi-automatic muscle segmentation in MR images using deep registration-based label propagation.', 'Fully automated segmentation of prostate whole gland and transition zone in diffusion-weighted MRI using convolutional neural networks.', 'Sequential Registration-Based Segmentation of the Prostate Gland in MR Image Volumes.', 'Superpixel-Based Segmentation for 3D Prostate MR Images.']"""

Typically, the dose distribution is evaluated based on few statistics and dose-volume histograms. Particularly for stereotactic treatments, the spatial dose distribution represents further criteria, e.g., when considering the gradient between subregions of volumes of interest. The authors have studied how to consider the spatial dose distribution using a multicriteria optimization approach.  Methods:   The authors have extended a stepwise multicriteria optimization approach to include criteria with respect to the local dose distribution. Based on a three-dimensional visualization of the dose the authors use a software tool allowing interaction with the dose distribution to map objectives with respect to its shape to a constrained optimization problem. Similarly, conflicting criteria are highlighted and the planner decides if and where to relax the shape of the dose distribution.  Results:   To demonstrate the potential of spatial multicriteria optimization, the tool was applied to a prostate and meningioma case. For the prostate case, local sparing of the rectal wall and shaping of a boost volume are achieved through local relaxations and while maintaining the remaining dose distribution. For the meningioma, target coverage is improved by compromising low dose conformality toward noncritical structures. A comparison of dose-volume histograms illustrates the importance of spatial information for achieving the trade-offs.  Conclusions:   The results show that it is possible to consider the location of conflicting criteria during treatment planning. Particularly, it is possible to conserve already achieved goals with respect to the dose distribution, to visualize potential trade-offs, and to relax constraints locally. Hence, the proposed approach facilitates a systematic exploration of the optimal shape of the dose distribution.""","""['Alexander Schlaefer', 'Tiberiu Viulet', 'Alexander Muacevic', 'Christoph Fürweger']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Dose-shaping using targeted sparse optimization.', 'Simultaneous beam geometry and intensity map optimization in intensity-modulated radiation therapy.', 'Stepwise multi-criteria optimization for robotic radiosurgery.', 'Coverage optimized planning: probabilistic treatment planning based on dose coverage histogram criteria.', 'Optimal reactive power compensation in electrical distribution systems with distributed resources.

Methods:   Tumors in the head and neck (H&N), pelvic, lung, and brain region were investigated. Biologically optimized carbon ion treatment plans were created with TRiP98. From these treatment plans, the reference β(+)-activity distributions were calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation. Setup errors were simulated by shifting or rotating the computed tomography (CT). The expected β(+) activity was calculated for each plan with shifts. Finally, the reference particle therapy PET images were compared to the ""shifted"" β(+)-activity distribution simulations using the Pearson's correlation coefficient (PCC). To account for different PET monitoring options the inbeam PET was compared to three different inroom scenarios. Additionally, the dosimetric effects of the CT misalignments were investigated.  Results:   The automated PCC detection of patient mispositioning was possible in the investigated indications for cranio-caudal shifts of 4 mm and more, except for prostate tumors. In the rather homogeneous pelvic region, the generated β(+)-activity distribution of the reference and compared PET image were too much alike. Thus, setup errors in this region could not be detected. Regarding lung lesions the detection strongly depended on the exact tumor location: in the center of the lung tumor misalignments could be detected down to 2 mm shifts while resolving shifts of tumors close to the thoracic wall was more challenging. Rotational shifts in the H&N and lung region of +6° and more could be detected using inroom PET and partly using inbeam PET. Comparing inroom PET to inbeam PET no obvious trend was found. However, among the inroom scenarios a longer measurement time was found to be advantageous.  Conclusions:   This study scopes the use of various particle therapy PET verification techniques in four indications. The automated detection of patients' setup errors was investigated in a broad accumulation of data sets. The evaluation of introduced setup errors is performed automatically, which is of utmost importance to introduce highly required particle therapy monitoring devices into the clinical routine.""","""['Peter Kuess', 'Stephan Helmbrecht', 'Fine Fiedler', 'Wolfgang Birkfellner', 'Wolfgang Enghardt', 'Johannes Hopfgartner', 'Dietmar Georg']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Automation and uncertainty analysis of a method for in-vivo range verification in particle therapy.', 'Systematic analysis on the achievable accuracy of PT-PET through automated evaluation techniques.', 'Dosimetric robustness against setup errors in charged particle radiotherapy of skull base tumors.', 'Evaluation of rotational errors in treatment setup of stereotactic body radiation therapy of liver cancer.', 'Positron emission tomography for radiation treatment planning.', 'Management of Motion and Anatomical Variations in Charged Particle Therapy: Past, Present, and Into the Future.', 'Latest developments in in-vivo imaging for proton therapy.', 'Radiation oncology in the era of precision medicine.']"""

The aim of this paper is to evaluate the variability of the local and global gamma index obtained during standard pretreatment quality assurance (QA) measurements for plans performed with Tomotherapy unit. The QA measurements were performed with a 3D diode array, using variable passing criteria: 3%∕3 mm, 2%∕2 mm, 1%∕1 mm, each with both local and global normalization.  Methods:   The authors analyzed the pretreatment QA results for 73 verifications; 37 were prostate cancer plans, 16 were head and neck plans, and 20 were other clinical sites. All plans were treated using the Tomotherapy Hi-Art System. Pretreatment QA plans were performed with the commercially available 3D diode array ArcCHECK™. This device has 1386 diodes arranged in a helical geometry spaced 1 cm apart. The dose measurements were acquired on the ArcCHECK™ and then compared with the calculated dose using the standard gamma analysis method. The gamma passing rate (%GP), defined as the percentage of points satisfying the condition GI < 1, was calculated for different criteria (3%∕3 mm, 2%∕2 mm, 1%∕1 mm) and for both global and local normalization. In the case of local normalization method, the authors set three dose difference threshold (DDT) values of 2, 3, and 5 cGy. Dose difference threshold is defined as the minimum absolute dose error considered in the analysis when using local normalization. Low-dose thresholds (TH) of 5% and 10% were also applied and analyzed.  Results:   Performing a paired-t-test, the authors determined that the gamma passing rate is independent of the threshold values for all of the adopted criteria (5%TH vs 10%TH, p > 0.1). Our findings showed that mean %GPs for local (or global) normalization for the entire study group were 93% (98%), 84% (92%), and 66% (61%) for 3%∕3 mm, 2%∕2 mm, and 1%∕1 mm criteria, respectively. DDT was equal to 2 cGy for the local normalization analysis cases. The authors observed great variability in the resulting %GP. With 3%∕3 mm gamma criteria, the overall passing rate with local normalization was 4.6% less on the average than with global one, as expected. The wide difference between %GP calculated with global or local approach is also confirmed by an unpaired t-test statistical analysis.  Conclusions:   The variability of %GP obtained confirmed the necessity to establish defined agreement criteria that could be universal and comparable between institutions. In particular, while the gamma passing rate does not depend on the choice of threshold, the choice of DDT strongly influences the gamma passing rate for local calculations. The difference between global and local %GP was statistically significant for prostate and other treatment sites when DDT was changed from 2 to 3 cGy.""","""['Sara Bresciani', 'Amalia Di Dia', 'Angelo Maggio', 'Claudia Cutaia', 'Anna Miranti', 'Erminia Infusino', 'Michele Stasi']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Pretreatment patient-specific IMRT quality assurance: a correlation study between gamma index and patient clinical dose volume histogram.', 'Gamma analysis dependence on specified low-dose thresholds for VMAT QA.', 'Toward optimizing patient-specific IMRT QA techniques in the accurate detection of dosimetrically acceptable and unacceptable patient plans.', 'Tolerance limits and methodologies for IMRT measurement-based verification QA: Recommendations of AAPM Task Group No. 218.', 'A six-year review of more than 13,000 patient-specific IMRT QA results from 13 different treatment sites.', 'Clinical experience on patient-specific quality assurance for CBCT-based online adaptive treatment plan.', 'Analysis of clinical patient-specific pre-treatment quality assurance with the new helical tomotherapy platform, following the AAPM TG-218 report.', 'Study on the ability of 3D gamma analysis and bio-mathematical model in detecting dose changes caused by dose-calculation-grid-size (DCGS).', 'Survey results of 3D-CRT and IMRT quality assurance practice.', 'Intraoperative computed tomography imaging for dose calculation in intraoperative electron radiation therapy: Initial clinical observations.']"""

Methods:   Eight clinical cases were chosen randomly from a bank of patients, previously treated in our clinic to test our method. The 2D Centroidal Voronoi Tessellations (CVT) algorithm was adapted to distribute catheters uniformly in space, within the maximum external contour of the planning target volume. The catheters optimization procedure includes the inverse planning simulated annealing algorithm (IPSA). Complete treatment plans can then be generated from the algorithm for different number of catheters. The best plan is chosen from different dosimetry criteria and will automatically provide the number of catheters and their positions. After the CVT algorithm parameters were optimized for speed and dosimetric results, it was validated against prostate clinical cases, using clinically relevant dose parameters. The robustness to implantation error was also evaluated. Finally, the efficiency of the method was tested in breast interstitial HDR brachytherapy cases.  Results:   The effect of the number and locations of the catheters on prostate cancer patients was studied. Treatment plans with a better or equivalent dose distributions could be obtained with fewer catheters. A better or equal prostate V100 was obtained down to 12 catheters. Plans with nine or less catheters would not be clinically acceptable in terms of prostate V100 and D90. Implantation errors up to 3 mm were acceptable since no statistical difference was found when compared to 0 mm error (p > 0.05). No significant difference in dosimetric indices was observed for the different combination of parameters within the CVT algorithm. A linear relation was found between the number of random points and the optimization time of the CVT algorithm. Because the computation time decrease with the number of points and that no effects were observed on the dosimetric indices when varying the number of sampling points and the number of iterations, they were respectively fixed to 2500 and to 100. The computation time to obtain ten complete treatments plans ranging from 9 to 18 catheters, with the corresponding dosimetric indices, was 90 s. However, 93% of the computation time is used by a research version of IPSA. For the breast, on average, the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group recommendations would be satisfied down to 12 catheters. Plans with nine or less catheters would not be clinically acceptable in terms of V100, dose homogeneity index, and D90.  Conclusions:   The authors have devised a simple, fast and efficient method to optimize the number and position of catheters in interstitial HDR brachytherapy. The method was shown to be robust for both prostate and breast HDR brachytherapy. More importantly, the computation time of the algorithm is acceptable for clinical use.

Although dynamic multileaf collimator (DMLC) tracking can mitigate the dosimetric impact of motion on the accumulated dose, residual errors still exist. The purpose of this study was to investigate the temporal evolution of dose errors throughout VMAT treatments delivered with and without DMLC tracking.  Methods:   Tracking experiments were performed on a linear accelerator connected to prototype DMLC tracking software. A three-axis motion stage reproduced representative clinical trajectories of four lung tumors and four prostates. For each trajectory, two VMAT treatment plans (low and high modulation) were delivered with and without DMLC tracking as well as to a static phantom for reference. Dose distributions were measured continuously at 72 Hz using a dosimeter with biplanar diode arrays. During tracking, the MLC leaves were continuously refitted to the 3D target position measured by an electromagnetic transponder at 30 Hz. The dosimetric errors caused in the 32 motion experiments were quantified by a time-resolved 3%/3 mm γ-test. The erroneously exposed areas in treatment beam's eye view (BEV) caused by inadequate real-time MLC adaptation were calculated and compared with the time-resolved γ failure rates.  Results:   The transient γ failure rate was on average 16.8% without tracking and 5.3% with tracking. The γ failure rate correlated well with the erroneously exposed areas in BEV (mean of Pearson r = 0.83, p < 0.001). For the final accumulated doses, the mean γ failure rate was 17.9% without tracking and 1.0% with tracking. With tracking the transient dose errors tended to cancel out resulting in the low mean γ failure rate for the accumulated doses.  Conclusions:   Time-resolved measurements allow pinpointing of transient errors in dose during VMAT delivery as well as monitoring of erroneous dose evolution in key target positions. The erroneously exposed area in BEV was shown to be a good indicator of errors in the dose distribution during treatment delivery.""","""['Thomas Ravkilde', 'Paul J Keall', 'Cai Grau', 'Morten Høyer', 'Per R Poulsen']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Electromagnetic guided couch and multileaf collimator tracking on a TrueBeam accelerator.', 'Image-based dynamic multileaf collimator tracking of moving targets during intensity-modulated arc therapy.', 'Fast motion-including dose error reconstruction for VMAT with and without MLC tracking.', 'Time-resolved dose reconstruction by motion encoding of volumetric modulated arc therapy fields delivered with and without dynamic multi-leaf collimator tracking.', 'A review of artificial intelligence applications for motion tracking in radiotherapy.', 'Acute Toxicity in Hypofractionated/Stereotactic Prostate Radiotherapy of Elderly Patients: Use of the Image-guided Radio Therapy (IGRT) Clarity System.', 'Novel methodologies for dosimetry audits: Adapting to advanced radiotherapy techniques.', 'Reduction of intra-fraction prostate motion - Determining optimal bladder volume and filling for prostate radiotherapy using daily 4D TPUS and CBCT.', 'Predicting real-time 3D deformation field maps (DFM) based on volumetric cine MRI (VC-MRI) and artificial neural networks for on-board 4D target tracking: a feasibility study.', 'Technical Note: In silico and experimental evaluation of two leaf-fitting algorithms for MLC tracking based on exposure error and plan complexity.']"""

The prostate, rectum, and bladder were manually contoured on the first six and last seven sets of daily verification images. For each patient, three patient specific atlases were constructed using manual contours from planning CT alone (1-image atlas), planning CT plus first three verification CTs (4-image atlas), and planning CT plus first six verification CTs (7-image atlas). These atlases were subsequently applied to the last seven verification image sets of the same patient to generate the auto-contours. Daily dose was calculated by applying the original treatment plans to the daily beam isocenters. The autocontours and manual contours were compared geometrically using the dice similarity coefficient (DSC), and dosimetrically using the dose to 99% of the prostate CTV (D99) and the D5 of rectum and bladder.  Results:   The DSC of the autocontours obtained with the 4-image atlases were 87.0% ± 3.3%, 84.7% ± 8.6%, and 93.6% ± 4.3% for the prostate, rectum, and bladder, respectively.

Methods:   Prostate IMAT plans were delivered with either a high-definition MLC (HDMLC) or a Millennium MLC (M-MLC) (0.25 and 0.50 cm central leaf width, respectively), with and without DMLC tracking, to a dosimetric phantom that reproduced four prostate motion traces. The plan complexity was varied by applying leaf position constraints during plan optimization. A subset of the M-MLC plans was converted for delivery with the HDMLC, isolating the effect of the different leaf widths. The gamma index was used for evaluation. Tracking errors caused by target localization, leaf fitting, and leaf adjustment were analyzed.  Results:   The gamma pass rate was significantly improved with DMLC tracking compared to no tracking (p < 0.001). With DMLC tracking, the average gamma index pass rate was 98.6% (range 94.8%-100%) with the HDMLC and 98.1% (range 95.4%-99.7%) with the M-MLC, using 3%, 3 mm criteria and the planned dose as reference. The corresponding pass rates without tracking were 87.6% (range 76.2%-94.7%) and 91.1% (range 81.4%-97.6%), respectively. Decreased plan complexity improved the pass rate when static target measurements were used as reference, but not with the planned dose as reference. The main cause of tracking errors was leaf fitting errors, which were decreased by 42% by halving the leaf width.  Conclusions:   DMLC tracking successfully compensated for the prostate motion. The finer leaf width of the HDMLC improved the tracking accuracy compared to the M-MLC. The tracking improvement with limited plan complexity was small and not discernible when using the planned dose as reference.""","""['Tobias Pommer', 'Marianne Falk', 'Per Rugaard Poulsen', 'Paul J Keall', ""Ricky T O'Brien"", 'Per Munck af Rosenschöld']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Technical Note: In silico and experimental evaluation of two leaf-fitting algorithms for MLC tracking based on exposure error and plan complexity.', 'Image-based dynamic multileaf collimator tracking of moving targets during intensity-modulated arc therapy.', 'Dosimetric benefit of DMLC tracking for conventional and sub-volume boosted prostate intensity-modulated arc radiotherapy.', 'Time-resolved dose distributions to moving targets during volumetric modulated arc therapy with and without dynamic MLC tracking.', 'Electromagnetic-guided dynamic multileaf collimator tracking enables motion management for intensity-modulated arc therapy.', 'Technical Note: In silico and experimental evaluation of two leaf-fitting algorithms for MLC tracking based on exposure error and plan complexity.', 'Image-guided radiotherapy and motion management in lung cancer.']"""

However, even though experimental data show an increase of the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) with depth, particularly at the distal end of the treatment field, a generic RBE of 1.1 is currently used in proton radiotherapy. This discrepancy might affect the effective penetration depth of the proton beam and thus the dose to the surrounding tissue and organs at risk. The purpose of this study was thus to analyze the impact of a tissue and dose dependent RBE of protons on the effective range of the proton beam in comparison to the range based on a generic RBE of 1.1.  Methods:   Factors influencing the biologically effective proton range were systematically analyzed by means of treatment planning studies using the Local Effect Model (LEM IV) and the treatment planning software TRiP98. Special emphasis was put on the comparison of passive and active range modulation techniques.  Results:   Beam energy, tissue type, and dose level significantly affected the biological extension of the treatment field at the distal edge. Up to 4 mm increased penetration depth as compared to the depth based on a constant RBE of 1.1. The extension of the biologically effective range strongly depends on the initial proton energy used for the most distal layer of the field and correlates with the width of the distal penumbra. Thus, the range extension, in general, was more pronounced for passive as compared to active range modulation systems, whereas the maximum RBE was higher for active systems.  Conclusions:   The analysis showed that the physical characteristics of the proton beam in terms of the width of the distal penumbra have a great impact on the RBE gradient and thus also the biologically effective penetration depth of the beam.""","""['Rebecca Grün', 'Thomas Friedrich', 'Michael Krämer', 'Klemens Zink', 'Marco Durante', 'Rita Engenhart-Cabillic', 'Michael Scholz']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Significance and implementation of RBE variations in proton beam therapy.', 'Inclusion of a variable RBE into proton and photon plan comparison for various fractionation schedules in prostate radiation therapy.', 'Systematics of relative biological effectiveness measurements for proton radiation along the spread out Bragg peak: experimental validation of the local effect model.', 'Relative Biological Effectiveness Uncertainties and Implications for Beam Arrangements and Dose Constraints in Proton Therapy.', 'Proton relative\xa0biological\xa0effectiveness (RBE): a multiscale problem.', 'Comparing biological effectiveness guided plan optimization strategies for cranial proton therapy: potential and challenges.', 'Technical note: Impact of beamline-specific particle energy spectra on clinical plans in carbon ion beam therapy.', 'Quantification of biological range uncertainties in patients treated at the Krakow proton therapy centre.', 'MR-guided proton therapy: Impact of magnetic fields on the detector response.', 'New Ions for Therapy.']"""

In addition, this study evaluates the relationship of these gamma analysis results and clinical dose volume histogram metrics (DVH) for Rapidarc treatment plans.  Methods:   Five prostate plans were modified by the introduction of systematic MLC errors. The MLC shifts to each individual active leaf introduced were 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1 mm. All QA verification plans were delivered and estimated 3D patient dose or high density phantom dose were obtained based on the ArcCHECK measurement files. QA gamma analysis of 3%/3 mm and 2%/2 mm were implemented and relationships to dose differences in DVH metrics encountered due to MLC errors were determined. Tolerances of 3% and 5% for DVH metric were implemented to determine the sensitivity of gamma analysis to MLC errors. A calculation of sensitivity was determined from the number of incidences of false negative and false positive cases in gamma analysis results.  Results:   The sensitivity of global gamma analysis for criteria of 3%/3 mm was 0.78 and for 2%/2 mm was 0.82. A number of instances occurred for an acceptable VMAT QA gamma index which did not indicate a DVH metric dose error greater than 5%. The correlation between global gamma analysis using criteria 3%/3 mm and DVH metric dose error were all <0.8 indicating less than a strong correlation.  Conclusions:   There is a greater sensitivity for detection of dosimetric errors occurring in a Rapidarc plan using gamma criteria of 2%/2 mm than 3%/3 mm. However, there is lack of consistently strong correlation between global gamma indexes and clinical DVH metrics for PTV and bladder and rectum for Rapidarc plans.

However, the clinical implementation of online reoptimization is currently limited by the low efficiency of current strategies and the difficulties associated with integration into the current treatment planning system. This study investigates the strategies for performing fast (~2 min) automatic online reoptimization with a clinical fluence-map-based treatment planning system; and explores the performance with different input parameters settings: dose-volume histogram (DVH) objective settings, starting stage, and iteration number (in the context of real time planning).  Methods:   Simulated treatments of 10 patients were reoptimized daily for the first week of treatment (5 fractions) using 12 different combinations of optimization strategies. Options for objective settings included guideline-based RTOG objectives, patient-specific objectives based on anatomy on the planning CT, and daily-CBCT anatomy-based objectives adapted from planning CT objectives. Options for starting stages involved starting reoptimization with and without the original plan's fluence map. Options for iteration numbers were 50 and 100. The adapted plans were then analyzed by statistical modeling, and compared both in terms of dosimetry and delivery efficiency.  Results:   All online reoptimized plans were finished within ~2 min with excellent coverage and conformity to the daily target. The three input parameters, i.e., DVH objectives, starting stage, and iteration number, contributed to the outcome of optimization nearly independently. Patient-specific objectives generally provided better OAR sparing compared to guideline-based objectives. The benefit in high-dose sparing from incorporating daily anatomy into objective settings was positively correlated with the relative change in OAR volumes from planning CT to daily CBCT. The use of the original plan fluence map as the starting stage reduced OAR dose at the mid-dose region, but increased the monitor units by 17%. Differences of only 2cc or less in OAR V50%/V70Gy/V76Gy were observed between 100 and 50 iterations.  Conclusions:   It is feasible to perform automatic online reoptimization in ~2 min using a clinical treatment planning system. Selecting optimal sets of input parameters is the key to achieving high quality reoptimized plans, and should be based on the individual patient's daily anatomy, delivery efficiency, and time allowed for plan adaptation.""","""['Taoran Li', 'Qiuwen Wu', 'You Zhang', 'Irina Vergalasova', 'W Robert Lee', 'Fang-Fang Yin', 'Q Jackie Wu']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Adaptive proton therapy.', 'Comparison of online IGRT techniques for prostate IMRT treatment: adaptive vs repositioning correction.', 'Assessment and management of interfractional variations in daily diagnostic-quality-CT guided prostate-bed irradiation after prostatectomy.', 'Coverage optimized planning: probabilistic treatment planning based on dose coverage histogram criteria.', 'Future directions for cryosurgery computer treatment planning.', 'Adaptive proton therapy.', 'Personalized setting of plan parameters using feasibility dose volume histogram for auto-planning in Pinnacle system.', 'Automated inverse optimization facilitates lower doses to normal tissue in pancreatic stereotactic body radiotherapy.']"""

This system would allow present and future gantry-based facilities to deliver state-of-the-art proton therapy with the greater normal tissue sparing made possible by intensity modulation techniques.  Methods:   A method for producing a divergent fan beam of protons using a pair of electromagnetic quadrupoles is described and particle transport through the quadrupole doublet is simulated using a commercially available software package. To manipulate the fan beam of protons, a modulation device is developed. This modulator inserts or retracts acrylic leaves of varying thickness from subsections of the fan beam. Each subsection, or beam channel, creates what effectively becomes a beam spot within the fan area. Each channel is able to provide 0-255 mm of range shift for its associated beam spot, or stop the beam and act as an intensity modulator. Results of particle transport simulations through the quadrupole system are incorporated into the MCNPX Monte Carlo transport code along with a model of the range and intensity modulation device. Several design parameters were investigated and optimized, culminating in the ability to create topotherapy treatment plans using distal-edge tracking on both phantom and patient datasets.  Results:   Beam transport calculations show that a pair of electromagnetic quadrupoles can be used to create a divergent fan beam of 200 MeV protons over a distance of 2.1 m. The quadrupole lengths were 30 and 48 cm, respectively, with transverse field gradients less than 20 T/m, which is within the range of water-cooled magnets for the quadrupole radii used. MCNPX simulations of topotherapy treatment plans suggest that, when using the distal edge tracking delivery method, many delivery angles are more important than insisting on narrow beam channel widths in order to obtain conformal target coverage. Overall, the sharp distal falloff of a proton depth-dose distribution was found to provide sufficient control over the dose distribution to meet objectives, even with coarse lateral resolution and channel widths as large as 2 cm. Treatment plans on both phantom and patient data show that dose conformity suffers when treatments are delivered from less than approximately ten angles. Treatment time for a sample prostate delivery is estimated to be on the order of 10 min, and neutron production is estimated to be comparable to that found for existing collimated systems.  Conclusions:   Fan beam proton therapy is a method of delivering intensity modulated proton therapy which may be employed as an alternative to magnetic scanning systems. A fan beam of protons can be created by a set of quadrupole magnets and modified by a dual-purpose range and intensity modulator. This can be used to deliver inversely planned treatments, with spot intensities optimized to meet user defined dose objectives. Additionally, the ability of a fan beam delivery system to effectively treat multiple beam spots simultaneously may provide advantages as compared to spot scanning deliveries.""","""['Patrick Hill', 'David Westerly', 'Thomas Mackie']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Comparison of two methods for minimizing the effect of delayed charge on the dose delivered with a synchrotron based discrete spot scanning proton beam.', 'Impact of planned dose reporting methods on Gamma pass rates for IROC lung and liver motion phantoms treated with pencil beam scanning protons.', 'A Universal Range Shifter and Range Compensator Can Enable Proton Pencil Beam Scanning Single-Energy Bragg Peak FLASH-RT Treatment Using Current Commercially Available Proton Systems.', 'Advances in Proton Therapy for the Management of Head and Neck Tumors.', 'The role of proton therapy in gynecological radiation oncology.']"""

The age-adjusted incidence and standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were calculated using the male population during 1992 to 2003 as a standard population.  Results:   The age-adjusted overall cancer incidence per 100 000 person-years was 455.3 in Vietnam veterans. The overall cancer incidence was slightly yet significantly lower in veterans (SIR, 0.97; 95% confidence interval, 0.95 to 0.99) than in the general population. The overall cancer incidence in enlisted soldiers was not lower (SIR, 1.00), whereas that in officers was significantly lower (SIR, 0.87) than in the general population. The incidences of prostate cancer and T-cell lymphoma in all veterans, and lung cancer and bladder cancer in enlisted soldiers, and colon cancer and kidney cancer in non-commissioned officers, and colon cancer, kidney cancer, and prostate cancer in officers, were higher than in the general population.

The AR signaling is also important in the development of castrate resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) where AR is functional even after androgen deprivation therapy (ADT); however, little is known regarding the transcriptional and functional regulation of AR in PCa. Moreover, treatment options for primary PCa for preventing the occurrence of CRPC is limited; therefore, novel strategy for direct inactivation of AR is urgently needed. In this study, we found loss of miR-34a, which targets AR, in PCa tissue specimens, especially in patients with higher Gleason grade tumors, consistent with increased expression of AR. Forced over-expression of miR-34a in PCa cell lines led to decreased expression of AR and prostate specific antigen (PSA) as well as the expression of Notch-1, another important target of miR-34a. Most importantly, BR-DIM intervention in PCa patients prior to radical prostatectomy showed reexpression of miR-34a, which was consistent with decreased expression of AR, PSA and Notch-1 in PCa tissue specimens. Moreover, BR-DIM intervention led to nuclear exclusion both in PCa cell lines and in tumor tissues. PCa cells treated with BR-DIM and 5-aza-dC resulted in the demethylation of miR-34a promoter concomitant with inhibition of AR and PSA expression in LNCaP and C4-2B cells. These results suggest, for the first time, epigenetic silencing of miR-34a in PCa, which could be reversed by BR-DIM treatment and, thus BR-DIM could be useful for the inactivation of AR in the treatment of PCa.[This corrects the article on p. 14 in vol. 4.].""","""['D Kong', 'E Heath', 'W Chen', 'M Cher', 'I Powell', 'L Heilbrun', 'Y Li', 'S Ali', 'S Sethi', 'O Hassan', 'C Hwang', 'N Gupta', 'D Chitale', 'Wa Sakr', 'M Menon', 'Fh Sarkar']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Am J Transl Res""","""['Epigenetic silencing of miR-34a in human prostate cancer cells and tumor tissue specimens can be reversed by BR-DIM treatment.', 'Epigenetic silencing of miR-34a in human prostate cancer cells and tumor tissue specimens can be reversed by BR-DIM treatment.', 'Inactivation of AR and Notch-1 signaling by miR-34a attenuates prostate cancer aggressiveness.', 'Androgen receptor splice variants contribute to prostate cancer aggressiveness through induction of EMT and expression of stem cell marker genes.', ""Role of BioResponse 3,3'-Diindolylmethane in the Treatment of Human Prostate Cancer: Clinical Experience."", 'MicroRNA-34a, Prostate Cancer Stem Cells, and Therapeutic Development.', 'In Search of Panacea-Review of Recent Studies Concerning Nature-Derived Anticancer Agents.', 'Culture and properties of adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells: characteristics in vitro and immunosuppression in vivo.']"""

However, 80-90% of the patients who receive androgen ablation therapy ultimately develop recurrent tumors in 12-33 months after treatment with a median overall survival time of 1-2 years after relapse. LNCaP is a commonly used cell line established from a human lymph node metastatic lesion of prostatic adenocarcinoma. We previously established two relapsed androgen receptor (AR)-rich androgen-independent LNCaP sublines 104-R1 (androgen depleted for 12 months) and 104-R2 cells (androgen depleted for 24 months) from AR-positive androgen-dependent LNCaP 104-S cells. LNCaP 104-R1 and 104-R2 mimics the AR-positive hormone-refractory relapsed tumors in patients receiving androgen ablation therapy. Androgen treatment stimulates proliferation of 104-S cells, but causes growth inhibition and G1 cell cycle arrest in 104-R1 and 104-R2 cells. We investigated the protein expression profile difference between LNCaP 104-S vs. LNCaP 104-R1, 104-R2, PC-3, and DU-145 cells as well as examined the sensitivity of these prostate cancer cells to different chemotherapy drugs and small molecule inhibitors.

For this purpose, statistical tests have often been applied to identify the differentially expressed genes (DEGs), followed by the employment of the state-of-the-art learning machines including the Support Vector Machines (SVM) in particular. The SVM is a typical sample-based classifier whose performance comes down to how discriminant samples are. However, DEGs identified by statistical tests are not guaranteed to result in a training dataset composed of discriminant samples. To tackle this problem, a novel gene ranking method namely the Kernel Matrix Gene Selection (KMGS) is proposed. The rationale of the method, which roots in the fundamental ideas of the SVM algorithm, is described. The notion of ''the separability of a sample'' which is estimated by performing [Formula: see text]-like statistics on each column of the kernel matrix, is first introduced. The separability of a classification problem is then measured, from which the significance of a specific gene is deduced. Also described is a method of Kernel Matrix Sequential Forward Selection (KMSFS) which shares the KMGS method's essential ideas but proceeds in a greedy manner.

The present analysis included 1622 patients with a history of a myocardial infarction, aged 60-80 years with an initial PSA concentration <4 ng/mL. They received either 2 g per day of ALA or placebo in margarine spreads for 40 months. T-tests and logistic regression were used to assess the effects of ALA supplementation on changes in serum PSA (both continuously and as a dichotomous outcome, cut-off point: >4 ng/mL).  Findings:   Mean serum PSA increased by 0.42 ng/mL on placebo (n = 815) and by 0.52 ng/mL on ALA (n = 807), a difference of 0.10 (95% confidence interval: -0.02 to 0.22) ng/mL (P = 0·12). The odds ratio for PSA rising above 4 ng/mL on ALA versus placebo was 1.15 (95% CI: 0.84-1.58).  Interpretation:   An additional amount of 2 g of ALA per day increased PSA by 0.10 ng/mL, but the confidence interval ranged from -0.02 to 0.22 ng/mL and included no effect. Therefore, more studies are needed to establish whether or not ALA intake has a clinically significant effect on PSA or prostate cancer.

Turmeric contains three principal components, curcumin, demethoxycurcumin and bisdemethoxycurcumin, of which curcumin is most abundant and potent. The concurrence of a high consumption of turmeric and a low incidence of prostate cancer in Asian countries may suggest a role for curcumin in chemoprevention. Curcumin has been identified to exhibit anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative and anticarcinogenic properties. Since the compound does not exhibit side effects, curcumin has been designated for several clinical trials as a treatment for human cancers. The pro-apototic, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory characteristics of curcumin are implicated in its anticancer activity, yet the mechanism of action of curcumin remains unknown. To achieve an effective pharmacological outcome, curcumin must reach and sustain appropriate levels at the site of action. However, the main disadvantage of curcumin is its high metabolic instability and poor aqueous solubility that limits its systemic bioavailability. To overcome this difficulty, the present study tested the anticancer activity of new curcumin-like compounds (E21cH and Q012095H). Also, the use of new medicaments requires an understanding of their pharmacokinetic profiles and targets. Thus, molecular modeling methods were used to identify the targets of curcumin and curcumin-like compounds compared with other anticancer drugs (Q012138 and Q012169AT), which were used as the controls. The present study identified several enzymes that are targeted by curcumin, aldo-keto reductase family 1 member B10 (AKR1B10), serine/threonine-protein kinase, protein kinase C, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP), cyclooxygenase and epidermal growth factor receptor, which were tested as targets for these anticancer chemicals. All the examined small compounds demonstrated anticancer activity in the in vitro experiments and may impact cancer cells by acting on AKR1B10, MMP-9 and their targets.""","""['Shireen Parsai', 'Rick Keck', 'Ewa Skrzypczak-Jankun', 'Jerzy Jankun']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Oncol Lett""","""['The Golden Spice for Life: Turmeric with the Pharmacological Benefits of Curcuminoids Components, including Curcumin, Bisdemethoxycurcumin, and Demethoxycurcumin.', 'A combination index and glycoproteomics-based approach revealed synergistic anticancer effects of curcuminoids of turmeric against prostate cancer PC3 cells.', 'Vasodilating, spasmolytic, inotropic and chronotropic activities of curcuminoids from Curcuma longa in isolated organ preparations of guinea pigs.', 'Potential Role of Curcumin and Its Nanoformulations to Treat Various Types of Cancers.', 'Anti-inflammatory properties of curcumin, a major constituent of Curcuma longa: a review of preclinical and clinical research.', 'The Cytotoxicity of Carbon Nanotubes and Hydroxyapatite, and Graphene and Hydroxyapatite Nanocomposites against Breast Cancer Cells.', 'diTFPP, a Phenoxyphenol, Sensitizes Hepatocellular Carcinoma Cells to C2-Ceramide-Induced Autophagic Stress by Increasing Oxidative Stress and ER Stress Accompanied by LAMP2 Hypoglycosylation.', 'Cytotoxicity of synthetic derivatives against breast cancer and multi-drug resistant breast cancer cell lines: a literature-based perspective study.', 'Advanced Computational Methodologies Used in the Discovery of New Natural Anticancer Compounds.', 'In vivo estrogenicity of p-phenoxyphenol and p-pentyloxyphenol.']"""

Despite of tremendous research efforts, however, molecular mechanisms on AR regulation remain poorly understood, particularly for castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Targeting AR and associated factors is considered an effective strategy in PCa treatment.  Methods:   Human prostate cancer cells were used in this study. Manipulations of Skp2 expression were achieved by Skp2 shRNA/siRNA or overexpression of plasmids. Dual luciferase reporter assay was applied for AR activity assessment. Western blot, ubiquitination assay, immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence were applied to detect the proteins.  Results:   Our results demonstrated that Skp2 directly involves the regulation of AR expression through ubiquitination-mediated degradation. Skp2 interacted with AR protein in PCa cells, and enforced expression of Skp2 resulted in a decreased level and activity of AR. By contrast, Skp2 knockdown increased the protein accumulation and activity of AR. Importantly, changes of AR contributed by Skp2 led to subsequent alterations of PSA level in PCa cells. AR ubiquitination was significantly increased upon Skp2 overexpression but greatly reduced upon Skp2 knockdown. AR mutant at K847R abrogated Skp2-mediated ubiquitination of AR. NVP-BEZ235, a dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor, remarkably inhibited Skp2 level with a striking elevation of AR.  Conclusions:   The results indicate that Skp2 is an E3 ligase for proteasome-dependent AR degradation, and K847 on AR is the recognition site for Skp2-mediated ubiquitination. Our findings reveal an essential role of Skp2 in AR signaling.""","""['Bo Li', 'Wenfu Lu', 'Qing Yang', 'Xiuping Yu', 'Robert J Matusik', 'Zhenbang Chen']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['SKP2 loss destabilizes EZH2 by promoting TRAF6-mediated ubiquitination to suppress prostate cancer.', 'Artemisinin disrupts androgen responsiveness of human prostate cancer cells by stimulating the 26S proteasome-mediated degradation of the androgen receptor protein.', 'Reciprocal feedback inhibition of the androgen receptor and PI3K as a novel therapy for castrate-sensitive and -resistant prostate cancer.', 'Role of PI3K-AKT-mTOR Pathway as a Pro-Survival Signaling and Resistance-Mediating Mechanism to Therapy of Prostate Cancer.', 'The PI3K-AKT-mTOR Pathway and Prostate Cancer: At the Crossroads of AR, MAPK, and WNT Signaling.', 'Mechanisms and targeting of proteosome-dependent androgen receptor degradation in prostate cancer.', 'The role of ubiquitination in spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy.', 'The androgen receptor-targeted proteolysis targeting chimera and other alternative therapeutic choices in overcoming the resistance to androgen deprivation treatment in prostate cancer.', 'TRIM33 drives prostate tumor growth by stabilizing androgen receptor from Skp2-mediated degradation.', 'Targeting KDM4A-AS1 represses AR/AR-Vs deubiquitination and enhances enzalutamide response in CRPC.']"""

Insufficient data are available on the distribution of sarcoglycans in nonmuscular tissue. In the present study, we used immunohistochemical and RT-PCR techniques to study the sarcoglycans also in normal human glandular tissue, a type of tissue never studied in relation to the sarcoglycan complex, with the aim of verifying the real wider distribution of this complex. To understand the role of sarcoglycans, we tested specimens collected from patients affected by benign prostatic hyperplasia and adenocarcinoma. For the first time, our results showed that all sarcoglycans are detectable in normal samples both in epithelial and in myoepithelial cells; in pathological prostate, sarcoglycans appeared severely reduced in number or were absent. These data demonstrated that all sarcoglycans have a wider distribution suggesting a new unknown role for these proteins. The decreased number of sarcoglycans, containing cadherin domain homologs in samples of prostate affected by hyperplasia, and the absence of proteins in prostate biopsies, in cases affected by adenocarcinoma, could be responsible for the loss of adhesion between epithelial cells, which in turn facilitates the progression of benign tumors and the invasive potential of malignant tumors.""","""['Giuseppina Cutroneo', 'Placido Bramanti', 'Angelo Favaloro', 'Giuseppe Anastasi', 'Fabio Trimarchi', 'Debora Di Mauro', 'Carmela Rinaldi', 'Francesco Speciale', 'Antonino Inferrera', 'Giuseppe Santoro', 'Salvatore Arena', 'Mario Patricolo', 'Carlo Magno']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Anat Rec (Hoboken)""","""['Sarcoglycans in the normal and pathological breast tissue of humans: an immunohistochemical and molecular study.', 'Expression of c-kit and kit-ligand in benign and malignant prostatic tissues.', 'IL-6, IL-10 and HSP-90 expression in tissue microarrays from human prostate cancer assessed by computer-assisted image analysis.', 'Evaluation of sarcoglycans, vinculin-talin-integrin system and filamin2 in alpha- and gamma-sarcoglycanopathy: an immunohistochemical study.', 'Allergic vasculitis in benign prostatic hyperplasia combined with a latent prostatic carcinoma.']"""

Here, we analyzed the role of exosomes from hypoxic PCA cells in enhancing the invasiveness and stemness of naïve PCA cells, as well as in promoting cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) phenotype in prostate stromal cells (PrSC). Human PCA LNCaP and PC3 cells were exposed to hypoxic (1% O2 ) or normoxic (21% O2 ) conditions, and exosomes secreted under hypoxic (Exo(Hypoxic) ) and normoxic (Exo(Normoxic) ) conditions were isolated from conditioned media. Nanoparticle tracking analysis revealed that Exo(Hypoxic) have smaller average size as compared to Exo(Normoxic) . Immunoblotting results showed a higher level of tetraspanins (CD63 and CD81), heat shock proteins (HSP90 and HSP70), and Annexin II in Exo(Hypoxic) compared to Exo(Normoxic) . Co-culturing with Exo(Hypoxic) increased the invasiveness and motility of naïve LNCaP and PC3 cells, respectively. Exo(Hypoxic) also promoted prostasphere formation by both LNCaP and PC3 cells, and enhanced α-SMA (a CAF biomarker) expression in PrSC. Compared to Exo(Normoxic) , Exo(Hypoxic) showed higher metalloproteinases activity and increased level of diverse signaling molecules (TGF-β2, TNF1α, IL6, TSG101, Akt, ILK1, and β-catenin). Furthermore, proteome analysis revealed a higher number of proteins in Exo(Hypoxic) (160 proteins) compared to Exo(Normoxic) (62 proteins), primarily associated with the remodeling of epithelial adherens junction pathway. Importantly, Exo(Hypoxic) targeted the expression of adherens junction proteins in naïve PC3 cells.

Materials and methods:   We enrolled 140 patients showing a serum PSA level >2 ng/mL (mean 8.6 ng/mL, median 5 ng/mL, range 2 - 60 ng/mL). All patients had been treated with EBRT to the prostate gland and prostatic fossa with doses ranging from 70 to 76 Gy in low-risk patients (T1/T2 and/or serum PSA <10 ng/mL) and escalating to >76 Gy (range 76 - 81 Gy) in high-risk patients (T3/T4 and/or serum PSA >10 ng/mL). Of the 140 patients, 53 were receiving androgen deprivation therapy at the time of the scan. All positive (11)C-choline PET/CT findings were validated by transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy or at least 12 months of follow-up with contrast-enhanced CT, MR, bone scintigraphy or a repeated (11)C-choline PET/CT scan. The relationships between the detection rate of (11)C-choline PET/CT and the factors PSA level, PSA kinetics, Gleason score, age, time to relapse and SUV max in patients with positive findings were analysed.  Results:   (11)C-Choline PET/CT detected the site of relapse in 123 of the 140 patients with a detection rate of 87.8 % (46 patients showed local relapse, 31 showed local and distant relapse, and 46 showed only distant relapse). In patients with relapse the mean serum PSA level was 9.08 ng/mL (median 5.1 ng/mL, range 2 - 60 ng/mL), the mean PSA doubling time was 5.6 months (median 3.5 months, range 0.4 - 48 months), and the mean PSA velocity was 15 ng/mL/year (median 8.8 ng/mL/year, range 0.4 - 87 ng/mL/year). Of the 123 patients with relapse, 77 (62.6 %) showed distant relapse with/without local relapse, and of these 77, 31 (40.2 %) showed oligometastatic disease (one or two distant lesions: lymph node lesions only in 16, bone lesions only in 14, and lymph node lesions and bone lesions in 1). In univariate and multivariate analyses PSA kinetics was the only variable affecting (11)C-choline PET/CT detection rate. A significant correlation between PSA kinetics and site of recurrence (local relapse only vs. distant metastasis) was also observed.  Conclusion:   The detection rate of (11)C-choline PET/CT in patients with PC showing biochemical recurrence after EBRT as primary treatment is relatively high (87.8 %). (11)C-Choline PET/CT was able to detect extraprostatic disease in the 62.6 % of patients.

However, compared to a classical ELISA, our device reduces the total cost of reagents by 4 orders of magnitude while increasing throughput by 2 orders of magnitude. Overall, we demonstrate an integrated approach to perform low-cost and rapid quantification of protein biomarkers from over one thousand serum samples.

Objective:   To develop and internally validate a novel nomogram predicting BCR after eSRT in patients treated with RP.  Design, setting, and participants:   Using a multi-institutional cohort, 472 node-negative patients who experienced BCR after RP were identified. All patients received eSRT, defined as local radiation to the prostate and seminal vesicle bed, delivered at prostate-specific antigen (PSA) ≤ 0.5 ng/ml.  Outcome measurement and statistical analysis:   BCR after eSRT was defined as two consecutive PSA values ≥ 0.2 ng/ml. Uni- and multivariable Cox regression models predicting BCR after eSRT were fitted. Regression-based coefficients were used to develop a nomogram predicting the risk of 5-yr BCR after eSRT. The discrimination of the nomogram was quantified with the Harrell concordance index and the calibration plot method. Two hundred bootstrap resamples were used for internal validation.  Results and limitations:   Mean follow-up was 58 mo (median: 48 mo). Overall, 5-yr BCR-free survival rate after eSRT was 73.4%. In univariable analyses, pathologic stage, Gleason score, and positive surgical margins were associated with the risk of BCR after eSRT (all p ≤ 0.04). These results were confirmed in multivariable analysis, where all the previously mentioned covariates as well as pre-RT PSA were significantly associated with BCR after eSRT (all p ≤ 0.04). A coefficient-based nomogram demonstrated a bootstrap-corrected discrimination of 0.74. Our study is limited by its retrospective nature and use of BCR as an end point.  Conclusions:   eSRT leads to excellent cancer control in patients with BCR for presumed local failure after RP. We developed the first nomogram to predict outcome after eSRT. Our model facilitates risk stratification and patient counselling regarding the use of secondary therapy for individuals experiencing BCR after RP.  Patient summary:   Salvage radiotherapy leads to optimal cancer control in patients who experience recurrence after radical prostatectomy.

A better understanding of the true prevalence and microbiology of these events is needed to guide quality improvement in this area and ultimately better early detection practices.  Materials and methods:   Using data from the MUSIC registry we identified all men who underwent transrectal prostate biopsy at 21 practices in Michigan from March 2012 to June 2013. Trained data abstractors recorded pertinent data including prophylactic antibiotics and all biopsy related hospitalizations. Claims data and followup telephone calls were used for validation. All men admitted to the hospital for an infectious complication were identified and their culture data were obtained. We then compared the frequency of infection related hospitalization rates across practices and according to antibiotic prophylaxis in concordance with AUA best practice recommendations.  Results:   The overall 30-day hospital admission rate after prostate biopsy was 0.97%, ranging from 0% to 4.2% across 21 MUSIC practices. Of these hospital admissions 95% were for infectious complications and the majority of cultures identified fluoroquinolone resistant organisms. AUA concordant antibiotics were administered in 96.3% of biopsies. Patients on noncompliant antibiotic regimens were significantly more likely to be hospitalized for infectious complications (3.8% vs 0.89%, p=0.0026).  Conclusions:   Infection related hospitalizations occur in approximately 1% of men undergoing prostate biopsy in Michigan. Our findings suggest that many of these events could be avoided by implementing new protocols (eg culture specific or augmented antibiotic prophylaxis) that adhere to AUA best practice recommendations and address fluoroquinolone resistance.""","""['Paul R Womble', 'Maxwell W Dixon', 'Susan M Linsell', 'Zaojun Ye', 'James E Montie', 'Brian R Lane', 'David C Miller', 'Frank N Burks;Michigan Urological Surgery Improvement Collaborative']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['A Statewide Intervention to Reduce Hospitalizations after Prostate Biopsy.', 'Reduction in hospital admission rates due to post-prostate biopsy infections after augmenting standard antibiotic prophylaxis.', 'Cost-effectiveness of standard vs intensive antibiotic regimens for transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS)-guided prostate biopsy prophylaxis.', 'Prevention of infectious complications after prostate biopsy procedure.', 'Baseline prevalence of antimicrobial resistance and subsequent infection following prostate biopsy using empirical or altered prophylaxis: A bias-adjusted meta-analysis.', 'Protocol of a multicentre randomised controlled trial assessing transperineal prostate biopsy to reduce infectiouscomplications.', 'Partial or radical nephrectomy for complex renal mass: a comparative analysis of oncological outcomes and complications from the ROSULA (Robotic Surgery for Large Renal Mass) Collaborative Group.', 'The past, present, and future of urological quality improvement collaboratives.', 'Transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy performed by supervised junior and senior residents is safe and does not result in inferior outcomes.', 'Enhanced antibiotic prophylaxis and infection-related complications following prostate biopsy.']"""

Some of these genetic variants are also associated with serum prostate specific antigen levels and lower urinary tract symptoms, raising the question of whether they are truly prostate cancer biomarkers or simply lead to detection bias. Therefore, we determined whether single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with prostate cancer risk are more strongly associated with tumor or prostate volume.  Materials and methods:   The genotypes of 38 validated prostate cancer risk single nucleotide polymorphisms were determined in 1,321 white men who underwent radical prostatectomy. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to compare the relationship of single nucleotide polymorphism frequency with total prostate and tumor volumes.  Results:   On multivariate analysis 2 single nucleotide polymorphisms on chromosome 8q24, rs16901979 (A) and rs6983267 (G), were significantly associated with increased tumor volume (p=0.01 and 0.02, respectively). In contrast, rs17632542 (T) near the PSA gene on 19q13 was associated with significantly lower tumor volume and rs10788160 (A) on 10q26 was associated with significantly larger prostate volume (p=0.02 and 0.01, respectively).  Conclusions:   Analysis of 38 single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with prostate cancer risk revealed a significant association between several on chromosome 8q24 and increased tumor volume but not prostate volume. This suggests that they are bona fide markers of prostate cancer susceptibility and possibly more aggressive disease. Other prostate cancer risk alleles are associated with prostate specific antigen and increased prostate or decreased tumor volume, suggesting detection bias due to their phenotypic influence.""","""['Daniel Reinhardt', 'Brian T Helfand', 'Phillip R Cooper', 'Kimberly A Roehl', 'William J Catalona', 'Stacy Loeb']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Prostate cancer risk allele specific for African descent associates with pathologic stage at prostatectomy.', 'Genetic sequence variants are associated with severity of lower urinary tract symptoms and prostate cancer susceptibility.', '8q24 and 17q prostate cancer susceptibility loci in a multiethnic Asian cohort.', 'Prognostic significance of prostate cancer susceptibility variants on prostate-specific antigen recurrence after radical prostatectomy.', '8q24 rs4242382 polymorphism is a risk factor for prostate cancer among multi-ethnic populations: evidence from clinical detection in China and a meta-analysis.', 'Biochemical activity induced by a germline variation in KLK3 (PSA) associates with cellular function and clinical outcome in prostate cancer.', 'Tumor Location and a Tumor Volume over 2.8 cc Predict the Prognosis for Japanese Localized Prostate Cancer.', 'Large extracellular vesicles carry most of the tumour DNA circulating in prostate cancer patient plasma.', 'Single-nucleotide polymorphisms of stemness genes predicted to regulate RNA splicing, microRNA and oncogenic signaling are associated with prostate cancer survival.', 'Correlation Between CASC8, SMAD7 Polymorphisms and the Susceptibility to Colorectal Cancer: An Updated Meta-Analysis Based on GWAS Results.']"""

MDR1 promoter methylation is frequent in prostate carcinoma (PCa), suggesting an epigenetic regulation but no functional correlation has been established. We aimed to elucidate the epigenetic mechanisms involved in MDR1 deregulation in PCa.  Results:   MDR1 promoter methylation and P-gp expression were assessed in 121 PCa, 39 high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN), 28 benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and 10 morphologically normal prostate tissue (NPT) samples, using quantitative methylation specific PCR and immunohistochemistry, respectively. PCa cell lines were exposed to a DNA methyltransferases inhibitor 5-aza-2'deoxycytidine (DAC) and histone deacetylases inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA). Methylation and histone posttranscriptional modifications status were characterized and correlated with mRNA and protein expression. MDR1 promoter methylation levels and frequency significantly increased from NPTs, to HGPIN and to PCa. Conversely, decreased or absent P-gp immunoexpression was observed in HGPIN and PCa, inversely correlating with methylation levels. Exposure to DAC alone did not alter significantly methylation levels, although increased expression was apparent. However, P-gp mRNA and protein re-expression were higher in cell lines exposed to TSA alone or combined with DAC. Accordingly, histone active marks H3Ac, H3K4me2, H3K4me3, H3K9Ac, and H4Ac were increased at the MDR1 promoter after exposure to TSA alone or combined with DAC.  Conclusion:   Our data suggests that, in prostate carcinogenesis, MDR1 downregulation is mainly due to histone post-translational modifications. This occurs concomitantly with aberrant promoter methylation, substantiating the association with P-gp decreased expression.""","""['Rui Henrique', 'Ana Isabel Oliveira', 'Vera L Costa', 'Tiago Baptista', 'Ana Teresa Martins', 'António Morais', 'Jorge Oliveira', 'Carmen Jerónimo']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""BMC Genomics""","""['Hypermethylation of Cyclin D2 is associated with loss of mRNA expression and tumor development in prostate cancer.', 'CpG hypermethylation of MDR1 gene contributes to the pathogenesis and progression of human prostate cancer.', 'DNA methylation paradigm shift: 15-lipoxygenase-1 upregulation in prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and prostate cancer by atypical promoter hypermethylation.', 'The expanding role of epigenetics in the development, diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'Histone H2A.Z deregulation in prostate cancer.

Palmitic acid (PA) is one of the most abundant saturated free fatty acids (FAs) and is associated with carcinogenesis. In this study, we investigated the mechanism underlying the association of dietary fat, including PA, with PCa progression. In four PCa cell lines, in vitro PA administration stimulated the expression of macrophage inhibitory cytokine 1 (MIC1), which is a divergent member of the transforming growth factor-β family. In vivo, LNCaP xenograft tumor growth, serum MIC1 levels, and FA levels in xenograft tumors were significantly higher in mice receiving an HFD containing high amounts of PA than in those receiving a low-fat diet (LFD). In addition, tumor cells with high MIC1 expression invaded to venules and lymph vessels in the LNCaP xenograft. In vitro studies showed that proliferation and invasive capacity were significantly higher in PCa cells cultured with serum from HFD-fed mice than in those cultured with the serum from LFD-fed mice. This effect was attenuated by the addition of neutralizing antibodies against MIC1, but not by isotype control antibodies. Clinically, serum MIC1 levels were significantly higher in PCa patients than in healthy controls, and higher levels were associated with higher pathological grade and obesity. In conclusion, our results indicate that an HFD containing PA may promote growth and invasiveness of PCa cells through the upregulation of MIC1 expression.""","""['Mingguo Huang', 'Shintaro Narita', 'Takamitsu Inoue', 'Norihiko Tsuchiya', 'Shigeru Satoh', 'Hiroshi Nanjo', 'Takehiko Sasaki', 'Tomonori Habuchi']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Endocr Relat Cancer""","""['Candidate genes involved in enhanced growth of human prostate cancer under high fat feeding identified by microarray analysis.', 'A high-fat diet enhances proliferation of prostate cancer cells and activates MCP-1/CCR2 signaling.', 'Association of diet-induced hyperinsulinemia with accelerated growth of prostate cancer (LNCaP) xenografts.', 'Altered miRNA expression in high-fat diet-induced prostate cancer progression.', 'Research Evidence on High-Fat Diet-Induced Prostate Cancer Development and Progression.', 'Clinical usefulness and acceleratory effect of macrophage inhibitory cytokine-1 on biliary tract cancer: an experimental biomarker analysis.', 'Altering phosphoinositides in high-fat diet-associated prostate tumor xenograft growth.', 'Worldwide flavor enhancer monosodium glutamate combined with high lipid diet provokes metabolic alterations and systemic anomalies: An overview.', 'Macrophage inhibitory cytokine-1 induced by a high-fat diet promotes prostate cancer progression by stimulating tumor-promoting cytokine production from tumor stromal cells.', 'Serum macrophage inhibitory cytokine-1 as a clinical marker for non-small cell lung cancer.']"""

However, to date, this has not been analyzed in an African American population, for whom data have often shown more aggressive prostate cancer than for other races.  Methods:   We analyzed 250 patients who were operated on at the NY Harbor Department of Veterans Affairs for localized prostate cancer between 2003 and 2010. The clinical biopsy scores were compared with the pathological biopsy scores. We compared the concordance using the κ coefficient. Univariate and multivariate logistic regressions were used to identify predictors for poor concordance.  Results:   This population consisted of 59.6% African Americans, 32% Caucasians, and 8.4% Hispanics. Overall, there was a 50% exact concordance between the biopsy and surgical specimens. The κ was 0.33, indicating fair agreement. Patients with a Gleason score of 6 were found to have an exact concordance 66% of the time, and those with a score of Gleason 7 (3 + 4) had an exact concordance 50% of the time. On univariate and multivariate analyses, only an increasing prostate-specific antigen was associated with reduced concordance. Race was not a significant predictor.

The purpose of this study was to present a recent history of establishing a valuable and reliable hospital- based cancer registry in a university hospital in Turkey, and the data gathered by this system in the last 9 years.  Methods:   This study included the cancer registry records of Hacettepe University Hospitals between 1-Jan-2003, and 31-Dec-2011. The study cohort included data of 39351 cancer patients and the cancer registry system was based on active data acquisition method.  Results:   Most frequent departments of reference were Medical Oncology, Radiation Oncology, General Surgery, Urology, and Pediatrics. The annual number of records gradually increased from 2675 in 2003 to 5152 in 2011. The 5 cancer types most frequency seen in adults were lung (15.5%), prostate (13.5%), stomach (6.6%), bladder (6.2%), and colon (5.8%) in men; and breast (32.7%), ovary (6.4%), uterine corpus (6.2%), uterine cervix (5.6%), and thyroid (5.0%) in women. Childhood cancers were classified according to the International Classification of Childhood Cancers, 3rd Edition (ICCC-3), and the most frequent 5 cancer types in children were tumors of the central nervous system (20.1%), lymphomas (14.6%), leukemia (14.1%), retinoblastoma (9.4%), and tumors of the sympathetic nervous system (7.7%).  Conclusion:   Active data acquisition from departments that deal with oncologic patients in a hospital is the precise method for establishing a high-quality cancer registry system that is able to resemble the general population.

Methods:   Our study included 182 patients with prostate adenocarcinoma who were biopsied and underwent radical surgical treatment at the Clinic of Urology, Clinical Center of Serbia, Medical Faculty in Belgrade from 1994 to 2004. Patients were prospectively followed-up and monitored for a minimum of 8 years and data were statistically processed by multivariate regression analysis. We arranged the predictors into 3 regressive models. In the first model the predictors were clinical stage of the disease, preoperative Gleason score, F/T PSA ratio and PSA. In the second model these predictors were accompanied with the number of positive biopsies and percent of positive prostate biopsies. In the third model, patient follow-up was added to the predictors. In all 3 models biochemical recurrence was considered as a dependent variable.  Results:   On multivariate analysis, patient follow-up (p<0.0001), percent of positive prostate biopsies (p<0.0001), bioptic Gleason score (p<0.0001) and preoperative PSA (p<0.003) were significant independent predictors of biochemical recurrence. The most successful prediction of recurrence that provided accurate prognosis for 80% of the patients was obtained by the third model using the percent of positive prostate biopsies, PSA and patient follow-up.  Conclusion:   As stated in multivariate analysis, the independent predictors according to the significance are the follows: patient follow-up, percent of positive prostate biopsies, bioptic Gleason score and preoperative PSA, whereas preoperative F/T PSA ratio is dependent predictor.

This year's report includes the prevalence of comorbidity at the time of first cancer diagnosis among patients with lung, colorectal, breast, or prostate cancer and survival among cancer patients based on comorbidity level.  Methods:   Data on cancer incidence were obtained from the NCI, the CDC, and the NAACCR; and data on mortality were obtained from the CDC. Long-term (1975/1992-2010) and short-term (2001-2010) trends in age-adjusted incidence and death rates for all cancers combined and for the leading cancers among men and women were examined by joinpoint analysis. Through linkage with Medicare claims, the prevalence of comorbidity among cancer patients who were diagnosed between 1992 through 2005 residing in 11 Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) areas were estimated and compared with the prevalence in a 5% random sample of cancer-free Medicare beneficiaries. Among cancer patients, survival and the probabilities of dying of their cancer and of other causes by comorbidity level, age, and stage were calculated.  Results:   Death rates continued to decline for all cancers combined for men and women of all major racial and ethnic groups and for most major cancer sites; rates for both sexes combined decreased by 1.5% per year from 2001 through 2010. Overall incidence rates decreased in men and stabilized in women. The prevalence of comorbidity was similar among cancer-free Medicare beneficiaries (31.8%), breast cancer patients (32.2%), and prostate cancer patients (30.5%); highest among lung cancer patients (52.9%); and intermediate among colorectal cancer patients (40.7%). Among all cancer patients and especially for patients diagnosed with local and regional disease, age and comorbidity level were important influences on the probability of dying of other causes and, consequently, on overall survival. For patients diagnosed with distant disease, the probability of dying of cancer was much higher than the probability of dying of other causes, and age and comorbidity had a smaller effect on overall survival.

As consequence, the fraction dose to the boost volume can be increased while keeping low doses to the elective volumes, and the number of fractions and overall treatment time will be reduced, translating into better radiobiological effectiveness. In recent years, volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT) has been shown to provide similar plan quality with respect to fixed-field IMRT but with large reduction in treatment time and monitor units (MUs) number. However, the feasibility of VMAT when used with SIB strategy has few investigations to date. We explored the potential of VMAT in a SIB strategy for complex cancer sites. A total of 15 patients were selected, including 5 head-and-neck, 5 high-risk prostate, and 5 rectal cancer cases. Both a double-arc VMAT and a 7-field IMRT plan were generated for each case using Oncentra MasterPlan treatment planning system for an Elekta Precise linac. Dosimetric indexes for targets and organs at risk (OARs) were compared based on dose-volume histograms. Conformity index, homogeneity index, and dose-contrast index were used for target analyses. The equivalent uniform doses and the normal tissue complication probabilities were calculated for main OARs. MUs number and treatment time were analyzed to score treatment efficiency. Pretreatment dosimetry was performed using 2-dimensional (2D)-array dosimeter. SIB-VMAT plans showed a high level of fluence modulation needed for SIB treatments, high conformal dose distribution, similar target coverage, and a tendency to improve OARs sparing compared with the benchmark SIB-IMRT plans. The median treatment times reduced from 13 to 20 minutes to approximately 5 minutes for all cases with SIB-VMAT, with a MUs reduction up to 22.5%. The 2D-array ion-chambers' measurements reported an agreement of more than 95% for a criterion of 3% to 3mm. SIB-VMAT was able to combine the advantages of conventional SIB-IMRT with its highly conformal dose distribution and OARs sparing and the advantages of 3D-conformal radiotherapy with its fast delivery.""","""['Savino Cilla', 'Francesco Deodato', 'Cinzia Digesù', 'Gabriella Macchia', 'Vincenzo Picardi', 'Marica Ferro', 'Giuseppina Sallustio', 'Marco De Spirito', 'Angelo Piermattei', 'Alessio G Morganti']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Med Dosim""","""['Volumetric modulated arc therapy with simultaneous integrated boost for locally advanced rectal cancer.', 'Single Arc Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy of head and neck cancer.', 'Comparison of whole-field simultaneous integrated boost VMAT and IMRT in the treatment of nasopharyngeal cancer.', 'Radiobiological basis and clinical results of the simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) in intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) for head and neck cancer: A review.', 'Is VMAT beneficial for patients undergoing radiotherapy to the head and neck?', 'Automated hybrid volumetric modulated arc therapy (HVMAT) for whole-breast irradiation with simultaneous integrated boost to lumpectomy area : A\xa0treatment planning study.', 'Personalized Treatment Planning Automation in Prostate Cancer Radiation Oncology: A Comprehensive Dosimetric Study.', 'Post-Operative Accelerated-Hypofractionated Chemoradiation With Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy and Simultaneous Integrated Boost in Glioblastoma: A Phase I Study (ISIDE-BT-2).', 'Partially ablative radiotherapy (PAR) for large mass tumors using simultaneous integrated boost: A dose-escalation feasibility study.', 'Assessment of multi-criteria optimization (MCO) for volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) in hippocampal avoidance whole brain radiation therapy (HA-WBRT).']"""

We determined the impact of this recommendation on prostate cancer screening in a large health system.  Materials and methods:   We obtained data on all screening prostate specific antigen tests performed at University Hospitals Case Medical Center and affiliated hospitals in northeastern Ohio from January 2008 to December 2012. We examined the total number of prostate specific antigen tests ordered with time and adjusted for patient volume by fitting a regression line. The overall trend was examined and stratified by location (urban, suburban or rural), patient age and provider type (primary care or urology).  Results:   A total of 43,498 screening prostate specific antigen tests were performed from January 2008 to December 2012. Most tests were ordered by specialists in internal medicine (64.9%), followed by family medicine (23.7%), urology (6.1%) and hematology/oncology (1.3%). Prostate specific antigen screening increased with time until March 2009, when initial screening trials were published. Prostate specific antigen testing then decreased significantly and continued to decrease after the task force recommendations. Similar patterns were noted in almost all subgroups. The greatest decrease in screening was observed by urologists and in patients in the intermediate age group (50 to 59 years).  Conclusions:   United States Preventive Services Task Force recommendations appeared to have decreased prostate cancer screening.

We sought to define a subset of patients with a higher likelihood of benefit from preoperative ADT.  Patients and methods:   An institutional database including consecutive patients receiving definitive surgery for localized prostate cancer was interrogated. Patients recorded as having received preoperative ADT were matched in a 1:2 fashion to patients who had not received previous ADT. Patients were matched on the basis of clinicopathologic characteristics, use of adjuvant treatment strategies, and duration of prostate-specific antigen follow-up. Time to biochemical recurrence (TTBR) was compared using the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test for the overall study population and in subsets defined according to D'Amico risk.  Results:   No significant differences in clinicopathologic characteristics were noted between recipients (n = 101) and matched nonrecipients (n = 196) of preoperative ADT. Although not statistically significant, positive surgical margin rates, seminal vesicle invasion, and extracapsular extension were less frequent in patients receiving preoperative ADT. Furthermore, a lesser incidence of perioperative complications was noted in this group (7.4% vs. 18.4%). No significant differences were noted in TTBR between recipients and nonrecipients of preoperative ADT in the overall study population. However, among patients with high-risk disease, TTBR was significantly longer in patients who had received preoperative ADT (P = .004).  Conclusion:   The data presented herein suggest a potential benefit of preoperative ADT in patients with high-risk localized prostate cancer.

In mammals these effects are mediated by Sonic, Desert and Indian Hedgehog (Shh, Dhh and Ihh). Shh undergoes autocatalytic cleavage and dual lipidation prior to secretion and forming a response gradient. Post-translational processing and secretion of Dhh and Ihh ligands has not previously been investigated. This study reports on the synthesis, processing, secretion and signaling activities of SHH, IHH and DHH preproteins expressed in cultured cells, providing unexpected evidence that DHH does not undergo substantial autoprocessing or secretion, and does not function in paracrine signaling. Rather, DHH functions as a juxtacrine signaling ligand to activate a cell contact-mediated HH signaling response, consistent with its localised signaling in vivo.

Material and methods:   Patient and tumour characteristics, surgeon, nerve sparing, surgical margins and blood loss were recorded prospectively in patients who underwent RRP or RALP between April 2008 and May 2012. Patients filled out the Danish Prostate Symptom Score (DAN-PSS) and International Index of Erectile Function 5 (IIEF-5) questionnaires before surgery and at follow-up and they were asked to report their use of pads/diapers. Potency was defined as an IIEF-5 score of at least 17 with or without phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors. Patients using up to one pad daily for security reasons only were considered continent. Positive surgical margins, blood loss and functional outcomes were compared between groups.  Results:   Overall, 453 patients were treated with RRP and 585 with RALP. On multivariate logistic regression analyses, the type of surgery did not affect surgical margins (p = 0.96) or potency at 12 months (p = 0.7). Patients who had undergone RRP had an increased chance of reporting subjective continence at 12 months (odds ratio 2.6, p = 0.014). There was no difference in the proportion of RRP and RALP patients who underwent surgical treatment for incontinence (p = 0.57). On multivariate linear regression analysis, RALP was an independent predictor of a low perioperative blood loss (RRP:RALP ratio = 2.89, p < 0.0001).

We conducted follow-up visits to all the patients, obtained the PSA levels and International Prostate Symptom scores (IPSS) at 6 and 12 months after TURP, analyzed their changes and assessed the value of TURP in the diagnosis and treatment of BPH with serum PSA abnormality.  Results:   Among the 40 patients with negative prostate biopsy and persistent serum PSA abnormality, 2 cases were diagnosed as Gleason score 6 prostatic adenocarcinoma by TURP biopsy, and 1 case as Gleason score 6 PCa by repeated biopsy. All the 3 patients underwent radical prostatectomies and were well recovered during the follow-up visits. Of the 31 patients who had refused biopsy, 9 cases were confirmed by postoperative pathology as Gleason score 7 -9 PCa, 1 treated by radical prostatectomy and the other 8 by endocrine therapy. Another 59 cases were pathologically diagnosed as BPH, of which, the serum PSA level was restored to normal in 56 and significantly reduced in the other 3, and IPSS was remarkably increased in 53 and improved in the other 6 following urethral soundings.

Material and methods:   The material for the study was the data published in the Swietokrzyskie Cancer Registry on the number of deaths caused by cancers as well as the information from the Central Statistical Office on the number of deaths due to general death causes in Swietokrzyskie Province in years 1999-2010. The premature mortality analysis was conducted with the use of PYLL indicator (PYLL - potential years of life lost). PYLL rate was calculated according to the method proposed by J. Romeder, according to which the premature mortality was defined as death before the age of 70. Time trends of PYLL rate and the average annual percent change (APC - annual percent change) were assessed usingjointpoint models as well as the Jointpoint Regression Program (Version 4.0.1 - January 2013).  Results:   In year 2010 cancers were responsible for 18.3% of PYLL in men and 48.1% in women. In years 1999-2010 PYLL rate in men decreased due to lung cancer (APC=0.75%) and stomach cancer (APC=1.2%). The increase in rate of PYLL was noted for colorectal cancer (APC=3.3%, p<0.05) and prostate cancer (APC=1.6%). In women, rate of PYLL increased due to lung cancer (APC=6.2%, p<0.05), colorectal cancer (APC=2.9%), breast cancer (APC=1.8%) and ovarian cancer (APC=0.15%). Rate of PYLL decreased due to cervical cancer (APC=4.3%, p<0.05) and stomach cancer (APC=1.5%).  Summary and conclusions:   During the analysed period the highest increase of premature mortality was observed in colorectal cancer in both sexes and lung cancer in women, a slightly smaller increase was noted for breast cancer and prostate cancer.

For extracolonic malignancies, there are variations in standardized incidence per reference population in terms of location (skin, liver and biliary tract, uterine cervix, prostate, etc.), and also IBD phenotype (ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease). The uncertainty regarding the occurrence of neoplasia in IBD patients for many years on immunosuppressive therapy and/or biological agents is a strong argument both for treatment discontinuation and it's monitoring by inclusion in screening programs.

If the metastatic movement of PCa cells could be inhibited, then mortality from PCa could be greatly reduced. Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 4 (MAP2K4) has previously been shown to activate pro-invasion signaling pathways in human PCa. Recognizing that MAP2K4 represents a novel and validated therapeutic target, we sought to develop and characterize an efficient process for the identification of small molecules that target MAP2K4. Using a fluorescence-based thermal shift assay (FTS) assay, we first evaluated an 80 compound library of known kinase inhibitors, thereby identifying 8 hits that thermally stabilized MAP2K4 in a concentration dependent manner. We then developed an in vitro MAP2K4 kinase assay employing the biologically relevant downstream substrates, JNK1 and p38 MAPK, to evaluate kinase inhibitory function. In this manner, we validated the performance of our initial FTS screen. We next applied this approach to a 2000 compound chemically diverse library, identified 7 hits, and confirmed them in the in vitro kinase assay. Finally, by coupling our structure-activity relationship data to MAP2K4's crystal structure, we constructed a model for ligand binding. It predicts binding of our identified inhibitory compounds to the ATP binding pocket.

Interestingly, both PTEN rescue and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor LY294002 treatment increase the PLZF expression in prostate cancer cell lines. Further, luciferase reporter assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay demonstrate that FOXO3a, a transcriptional factor phosphorylated by PI3K/AKT, could directly bind to the promoter of PLZF gene. These results indicate that PTEN regulates PLZF expression by AKT/FOXO3a. Moreover, our animal experiments also demonstrate that PLZF is capable of inhibiting prostate tumorigenesis in vivo.

Recent reports show that stress inhibits apoptosis in prostate cancer cells via epinephrine/beta2 adrenergic receptor/PKA/BAD pathway. In this study, we used experimental data on the signaling pathways that control BAD phosphorylation to build a dynamic network model of apoptosis regulation in prostate cancer cells. We then compared the predictive power of two different models with or without the role of Mcl-1, which justified the role of Mcl-1 stabilization in anti-apoptotic effects of emotional stress. Based on the selected model, we examined and quantitatively evaluated the induction of apoptosis by drug combination therapies. We predicted that the combination of PI3K inhibitor LY294002 and inhibition of BAD phosphorylation at S112 would produce the best synergistic effect among 8 interventions examined. Experimental validation confirmed the effectiveness of our predictive model. Moreover, we found that epinephrine signaling changes the synergism pattern and decreases efficacy of combination therapy. The molecular mechanisms responsible for therapeutic resistance and the switch in synergism were explored by analyzing a network model of signaling pathways affected by psychological stress.

Ninety-eight cancers (86%) were detected with TURP and biopsy, and seven cancers (6.1%) with only TURP. The Gleason score of a TUR-specimen was identical to that of the biopsy-core in 43.9% of cases. Variables associated with diagnostic accuracy in the TUR-specimens included the prebiopsy PSA level, prostate specific antigen density (PSAD), and the Gleason score in biopsy cores. In patients with a PSA level and a PSAD that was greater than 15.4 ng/mL and 0.69 ng/mL/g, respectively, 100% of the cancers were detected in the TUR-specimens.

Noscapine is also known to possess weak anticancer efficacy, and since its discovery, efforts have been made to design derivatives with improved potency. Herein, the synthesis of a series of noscapine analogues, which have been modified in the 6', 9', 1 and 7-positions, is described. In a previous study, replacement of the naturally occurring N-methyl group in the 6'-position with an N-ethylaminocarbonyl was shown to promote cell-cycle arrest and cytotoxicity against three cancer cell lines. Here, this modification has been combined with other structural changes that have previously been shown to improve anticancer activity, namely halo substitution in the 9'-position, regioselective O-demethylation to reveal a free phenol in the 7-position, and reduction of the lactone to the corresponding cyclic ether in the 1-position. The incorporation of new aryl substituents in the 9'-position was also investigated. The study identified interesting new compounds able to induce G2/M cell-cycle arrest and that possess cytotoxic activity against the human prostate carcinoma cell line PC3, the human breast adenocarcinoma cell line MCF-7, and the human pancreatic epithelioid carcinoma cell line PANC-1. In particular, the ethyl urea cyclic ether noscapinoids and a compound containing a 6'-ethylaminocarbonyl along with 9'-chloro, 7-hydroxy and lactone moieties exhibited the most promising biological activities, with EC50 values in the low micromolar range against all three cancer cell lines, and these derivatives warrant further investigation.""","""['Aaron J Debono', 'Sarah J Mistry', 'Jinhan Xie', 'Divya Muthiah', 'Jackson Phillips', 'Sabatino Ventura', 'Richard Callaghan', 'Colin W Pouton', 'Ben Capuano', 'Peter J Scammells']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""ChemMedChem""","""['Synthesis and biological evaluation of N-substituted noscapine analogues.', 'A Novel Class of N-Sulfonyl and N-Sulfamoyl Noscapine Derivatives that Promote Mitotic Arrest in Cancer Cells.', 'Rational design of biaryl pharmacophore inserted noscapine derivatives as potent tubulin binding anticancer agents.', 'Noscapine comes of age.', 'Taking aim at a dynamic target: Noscapinoids as microtubule-targeted cancer therapeutics.', 'Berberine Inhibits Herpes Simplex Virus 1 Replication in HEK293T Cells.', 'Imidazo2,1-bthiazole-Coupled Natural Noscapine Derivatives as Anticancer Agents.', 'Noscapine chemosensitization enhances docetaxel anticancer activity and nanocarrier uptake in triple negative breast cancer.', 'The Noscapine Chronicle: A Pharmaco-Historic Biography of the Opiate Alkaloid Family and its Clinical Applications.', 'Metabolic pathway profiling of the derivative of important herbal component noscapine.']"""

Materials and methods:   We retrospectively reviewed the records of 156 incidental prostate cancer patients between 2001 and 2012. The clinicopathologic outcomes were reviewed and follow-up results were obtained.  Results:   Among 156 patients, 97 (62.2%) had T1a and 59 (37.8%) had T1b. Forty-six (29.5%) received AS, 67 (42.9%) underwent RP, 34 (21.8%) received HT, 4 (2.6%) received radiotherapy, and 5 (3.2%) chose watchful waiting. Of 46 patients on AS, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression occurred in 12 (26.1%) patients. Among them, 3 patients refused treatment despite PSA progression. Five patients, who underwent RP as an intervention, all had organ-confined Gleason score ≤6 disease. In 67 patients who underwent RP, 50 (74.6%) patients had insignificant prostate cancer and 8 (11.9%) patients showed unfavorable features. During follow-up, biochemical recurrence occurred in 2 patients. Among 34 patients who received HT, 3 (8.8%) patients had PSA progression. Among 156 patients, 6 patients died due to other causes during follow-up. There were no patients who died due to prostate cancer.  Conclusion:   The clinical outcomes of incidental prostate cancer were satisfactory regardless of the initial treatment. However, according to recent researches and guidelines, immediate definite therapy should be avoided without a careful assessment.

Unfortunately, currently SHG imaging techniques have limited capability due to the poor signal-to-noise ratio, resulting from the low SHG efficiency of available dyes. Targeted tumor imaging over nontargeted tissues is also a challenge that needs to be overcome. Driven by this need, in this study, the development of two-photon SHG imaging of live cancer cell lines selectively by enhancement of the nonlinear optical response of gold nanocage assemblies is reported. Experimental results show that two-photon scattering intensity can be increased by few orders of magnitude by just developing nanoparticle self-assembly. Theoretical modeling indicates that the field enhancement values for the nanocage assemblies can explain, in part, the enhanced nonlinear optical properties. Our experimental data also show that A9 RNA aptamer conjugated gold nanocage assemblies can be used for targeted SHG imaging of the LNCaP prostate cancer cell line. Experimental results with the HaCaT normal skin cell lines show that bioconjugated nanocage-based assemblies demonstrate SHG imaging that is highly selective and will be able to distinguish targeted cancer cell lines from other nontargeted cell types.

However, its prevalence may have been underestimated. Trichomonads are detected in prostatic tissue in benign prostatic hyperplasia, prostatitis, and prostate cancer. Our objective was to investigate whether T. vaginalis could induce an inflammatory response in prostate epithelium.  Methods:   The cytokine production by human prostate epithelial cell (RWPE-1) activated with T. vaginalis was determined by ELISA and real-time PCR. Intracellular ROS was evaluated by flow cytometry or spectrofluorometry. The protein levels of MAP kinase, NF-κB were analyzed by Western blot. The migration of neutrophil and monocyte were performed in 24-well microplates with filter insert.  Results:   Incubation of cells of a human prostate epithelial cell line with a live T. vaginalis T016 isolate increased expression of the inflammatory mediators IL-1β, CCL2, and CXCL8. In addition, ROS, MAPK, and NF-κB activities increased, while inhibitors of ROS, ERK, and NF-κB reduced IL-1β production. Medium conditioned by incubation of RWPE-1 cells with T. vaginalis contained IL-1β and stimulated the migration of human neutrophils and monocytes (THP-1 cell line).  Conclusions:   We conclude that T. vaginalis may increase IL-1β expression in human prostate epithelium through activation of ROS, ERK, and NF-κB, and this in turn may induce the migration of neutrophils and monocytes and lead to an inflammatory response.

However, in countries where abiraterone has not been approved yet, or for patients who cannot afford it, ketoconazole is used as an alternative CYP 17 inhibitor. Although preclinical data suggests that ketoconazole is a less potent inhibitor of CYP 17, there are limited clinical data comparing both agents. We aimed to compare the clinical effectiveness of abiraterone versus ketoconazole in docetaxel refractory mCRPC.  Methods:   Records from mCRPC patients treated with ketoconazole (international multicenter database, n = 162) were reviewed retrospectively. Twenty-six patients treated post docetaxel were individually matched by clinicopathologic factors to patients treated with abiraterone (national multicenter database, n = 140). We compared the PSA response, biochemical and radiological progression free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) between the groups. PFS and OS were determined by Cox regression.  Results:   The groups were matched by Gleason score, pre-treatment disease extent, ECOG PS, pre-treatment risk category (Keizman, Oncologist 2012). Furthermore, they were balanced regarding other known confounding risk factors. In the groups of abiraterone versus ketoconazole, PSA response was 46% versus 19% (OR 4.3, P = 0.04), median biochemical PFS 7 versus 2 months (HR 1.54, P = 0.02), median radiological PFS 8 versus 2.5 months (HR 1.8, P = 0.043), median OS 19 versus 11 months (HR 0.53, P = 0.79), and treatment interruption d/t severe adverse events 8% (n = 2) versus 31% (n = 8) (0R 0.6, P = 0.023).

Trypan blue dye exclusion assay or clonogenic assay was performed for determination of cell viability. The effects of HNK and/or its analogs on protein levels of AR and its target gene product prostate specific antigen (PSA) were determined by western blotting. RNA interference of p53 was achieved by transient transfection. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was performed for mRNA expression of AR. Nuclear level of AR was visualized by microscopy. Apoptosis was quantified by DNA fragmentation assay or flow cytometry after Annexin V-propidium iodide staining.  Results:   HNK and its dichloroacetate analog (HDCA) were relatively more effective in suppressing cell viability and AR protein level than honokiol epoxide or biseugenol. Nuclear translocation of AR stimulated by a synthetic androgen (R1881) was markedly suppressed in the presence of HNK. Downregulation of AR protein resulting from HNK exposure was attributable to transcriptional repression as well as proteasomal degradation. HNK-mediated suppression of AR protein was maintained in LNCaP cells after knockdown of p53 protein. HNK-induced apoptosis was not affected by R1881 treatment.

An inflammatory stroma is a widespread hallmark of the prostate TME, and prostate tumors are known to co-evolve with their reactive stroma. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) within the reactive stroma play a salient role in secreting cytokines that contribute to this inflammatory TME. Although a number of inflammatory mediators have been identified, a clear understanding of key factors initiating the formation of reactive stroma is lacking.  Methods:   We explored whether tumor secreted extracellular Hsp90 alpha (eHsp90α) may initiate a reactive stroma. Prostate stromal fibroblasts (PrSFs) were exposed to exogenous Hsp90α protein, or to conditioned medium (CM) from eHsp90α-expressing prostate cancer cells, and evaluated for signaling, motility, and expression of prototypic reactive markers. In tandem, ELISA assays were utilized to characterize Hsp90α-mediated secreted factors.  Results:   We report that exposure of PrSFs to eHsp90 upregulates the transcription and protein secretion of IL-6 and IL-8, key inflammatory cytokines known to play a causative role in prostate cancer progression. Cytokine secretion was regulated in part via a MEK/ERK and NF-κB dependent pathway. Secreted eHsp90α also promoted the rapid and durable activation of the oncogenic inflammatory mediator signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT3). Finally, eHsp90 induced the expression of MMP-3, a well-known mediator of fibrosis and the myofibroblast phenotype.

Prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP) is a prostate-specific protein overexpressed in 95% of prostate tumours. An FDA-approved vaccine for the treatment of advanced prostate disease, PROVENGE® (sipuleucel-T), has been shown to prolong survival, however the precise sequence of the PAP protein responsible for the outcome is unknown. As the PAP antigen is one of the very few prostate-specific antigens for which there is a rodent equivalent with high homology, preclinical studies using PAP have the potential to be directly relevant to clinical setting. Here, we show three PAP epitopes naturally processed and presented in the context of HHDII/DR1 (114-128, 299-313, and 230-244). The PAP-114-128 epitope elicits CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cell-specific responses in C57BL/6 mice.

To determine the postintervention effects of α-tocopherol and β-carotene, 25,563 men were followed 18 years for cancer incidence and all causes of mortality through national registers. Neither supplement had significant effects on post-trial cancer incidence. Relative risk (RR) for lung cancer (n = 2,881) was 1.04 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.96-1.11) among β-carotene recipients compared with nonrecipients. For prostate cancer (n = 2,321), RR was 0.97 (95% CI, 0.89-1.05) among α-tocopherol recipients compared with nonrecipients with the preventive effect of α-tocopherol continuing ∼8 years postintervention.

Then, the associations of MYL9 expression with clinicopathological features and clinical outcome of PCa patients were statistically analyzed. Both Western blot and immunohistochemistry analyses found that MYL9 expression was significantly decreased (both P < 0.001) in PCa tissues compared with those in non-cancerous prostate tissues. In addition, MYL9 was mainly expressed in the cytoplasm of stromal cells of prostate tissues, and the decreased expression of MYL9 in PCa tissues was significantly correlated with the older age of patients (P = 0.011), the higher Gleason score (P < 0.001), the advanced pathological stage (P = 0.002), the presence of metastasis (P < 0.001) and PSA failure (P = 0.001).

Results:   For 2 years, there were no significant changes in EPIC scores in all subscales of urinary domain, hormonal function, and bother. Bowel and sexual function scores decreased after IMRT and did not return to those at baseline (p = 0.006 and < 0.001, respectively). PCS began to decrease at 3 months after IMRT and then returned to the baseline score at 24 months.

Methods:   Participants in the study were older PCSs (>60 years) and their spouses (N=59 couples). Symptom incongruence was determined by comparing patient and spouse independent ratings of the severity of his cancer-related symptoms. Predictor variables included PCS age, time since diagnosis, PCS comorbidity, PCS and spouse depressive symptoms, and spouse caregiving strain.  Results:   PCS and spouse ratings of his symptom severity and the amount of incongruence over his symptoms varied significantly across couples. Overall, couples rated a moderate level of PCS symptom severity, but PCSs and their spouses significantly differed in their perceptions of PCS symptom severity with spouses rating severity higher (t=-2.66, df=51, p<0.01). PCS younger age and high spouse caregiver strain accounted for 29 % of incongruence in perceptions of PCS symptom severity.  Conclusions:   This study is among the first to show that PCSs and spouses may perceive cancer-related persistent symptoms differently.

Results:   Evaluable data were available from 83 patients (65 with prostate cancer).

Conclusions:   Assessing and managing chemotherapy-related fatigue remains a major challenge. There was a lack of difference between the two arms in the planned primary endpoint. However, there was a modest but consistent trend towards improvement of docetaxel-related fatigue in those treated with modafinil.

Methods:   In this study, PEGylated liposomes were loaded with (225)Ac and labeled with the mouse antihuman PSMA J591 antibody or with the A10 PSMA aptamer. The targeting selectivity, extent of internalization, and killing efficacy of liposomes were evaluated on monolayers of prostate cancer cells intrinsically expressing PSMA (human LNCaP and rat Mat-Lu cells) and on monolayers of HUVEC induced to express PSMA (induced HUVEC).  Results:   The loading efficiency of (225)Ac into preformed liposomes ranged from 58.0% ± 4.6% to 85.6% ± 11.7% of introduced radioactivity. The conjugation reactions resulted in approximately 17 ± 2 J591 antibodies and 9 ± 2 A10 aptamers per liposome. The average size of liposomes, 107 ± 2 nm in diameter, was not affected by conjugation or loading. LNCaP cells exhibit 2:1:0.5 relative PSMA expression, compared with MatLu and induced HUVEC, respectively, based on flow cytometry detecting association of the J591 antibody. J591-labeled liposomes display higher levels of total specific binding to all cell lines than A10 aptamer-labeled liposomes. Specific cell association of targeted liposomes increases with incubation time. Cytotoxicity studies demonstrate that radiolabeled J591-labeled liposomes are most cytotoxic, with median lethal dose values, after 24 h of incubation, equal to 1.96 (5.3 × 10(-5)), 2.92 × 10(2) (7.9 × 10(-3)), and 2.33 × 10(1) Bq/mL (6.3 × 10(-4) μCi/mL) for LNCaP, Mat-Lu, and induced HUVEC, respectively, which are comparable to the values for the radiolabeled J591 antibody.

An initial negative TRUS-guided prostate biopsy does not necessarily exclude the presence of clinically significant prostate cancer. We determined the role of transperineal template prostate biopsy (TPTPB) in prostate cancer detection in men with raised PSA despite two previous sets of negative TRUS biopsies.  Methods:   Between January 2008 and August 2012, a total of 122 men's records were reviewed after having 36-core TPTPB following two previous sets of negative TRUS biopsies despite raised PSA. A retrospective record of PSA levels, clinicopathological parameters and histological outcomes was made.  Results:   Mean age was 63 years (range 49-77), and mean PSA was 18.0 (range 2.0-119.0).

Previous deep sequencing identified the miRNA profile of prostate carcinoma versus nonmalignant prostate tissue. Here, we generated miRNA expression profiles of prostate carcinoma by deep sequencing, with increasing tumor stage relative to corresponding nonmalignant and healthy prostate tissue, and detected clearly changed miRNA expression patterns. The miRNA profiles of the healthy and nonmalignant tissues were consistent with our previous findings, indicating a high fidelity of the method employed. In the tumors, quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis of 40 paired samples of prostate carcinoma versus normal tissue revealed significant upregulation of miR-20a, miR-148a, miR-200b, and miR-375 and downregulation of miR-143 and miR-145. Hereby, miR-375 increased from normal to organ-confined tumors (pT2 pN0), slightly decreased in tumors with extracapsular growth (pT3 pN0), but was then expressed again at higher levels in lymph node metastasizing (pN1) tumors. The sequencing data for miR-375 were confirmed by Northern blotting and qRT-PCR. The regulation for other selected miRNAs could, however, not be confirmed by qRT-PCR in individual tumor stages. MiR-200b, in addition to miR-200c and miR-375 reduced the expression of SEC23A. Interestingly, miR-375, found by sequencing in pT2 upregulated by us and others in tumor versus normal tissue, and miR-15a, found by sequencing in pT2 and pT3 and in the metastasizing tumors, target the phosphatases PHLPP1 and PHLPP2, respectively. PHLPP1 and PHLPP2 dephosphorylate members of the AKT family of signal transducers, thereby inhibiting cell growth. Coexpression of miR-15a and miR-375 resulted in downregulation of PHLPP1/2 and strongly increased prostate carcinoma cell growth.

Materials and methods:   The electronic records and clinical notes were reviewed for all patients assessed for confirmed or potential mSCC at Charing Cross Hospital in 2012. Details on the number of referrals, the proportion with confirmed mSCC, the cancer diagnosis, treatment and outcome were analysed.  Results:   191 patients were reviewed with 127 (66%) cases of confirmed mSCC. The commonest tumour types were prostate cancer (26 cases), lung cancer (26), breast cancer (21) and kidney cancer (15). 21% of the patients had no previous cancer diagnosis; mSCC was their presenting diagnostic event. Radiotherapy was the predominant management, 24% of the patients had first line surgical treatment. At presentation 62% of patients were either chair or bed bound. Treatment brought important mobility benefits to all patients groups with 20% of the initially chair or bed bound patients leaving the hospital with independent mobility.  Conclusion:   Enhanced patients pathways with ease of access, rapid assessment and prompt treatment can improve outcomes.

Conclusions:   Among this group of AAC men, socioeconomic status, such as education and professional background, were factors that influenced their level of awareness of prostate cancer and prompted their decisions to seek help.

A complex network of zinc import and transport proteins has evolved to control zinc concentration and distribution on a subcellular level. Understanding the action of mobile zinc requires tools that can detect changes in Zn(II) concentrations at discrete cellular locales. We present here a zinc-responsive, reaction-based, targetable probe based on the diacetyled form of Zinpyr-1. The compound, (6-amidoethyl)triphenylphosphonium Zinpyr-1 diacetate (DA-ZP1-TPP), is essentially nonfluorescent in the metal-free state; however, exposure to Zn(II) triggers metal-mediated hydrolysis of the acetyl groups to afford a large, rapid, and zinc-induced fluorescence response. DA-ZP1-TPP is insensitive to intracellular esterases over a 2-h period and is impervious to proton-induced turn-on. A TPP unit is appended for targeting mitochondria, as demonstrated by live cell fluorescence imaging studies. The practical utility of DA-ZP1-TPP is demonstrated by experiments revealing that, in contrast to healthy epithelial prostate cells, tumorigenic cells are unable to accumulate mobile zinc within their mitochondria.""","""['Wen Chyan', 'Daniel Y Zhang', 'Stephen J Lippard', 'Robert J Radford']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A""","""['HaloTag-Based Hybrid Targetable and Ratiometric Sensors for Intracellular Zinc.', 'Understanding zinc quantification with existing and advanced ditopic fluorescent Zinpyr sensors.', 'A novel two-fluorophore approach to ratiometric sensing of Zn(2+).', 'Imaging mobile zinc in biology.', 'Mitochondrial function, zinc, and intermediary metabolism relationships in normal prostate and prostate cancer.', 'Recent endeavors on molecular imaging for mapping metals in biology.', 'Thermogenic adipocyte-derived zinc promotes sympathetic innervation in male mice.', 'Advances in reaction-based synthetic fluorescent probes for studying the role of zinc and copper ions in living systems.', 'Zinc in Prostate Health and Disease: A Mini Review.', 'Mobile zinc as a modulator of sensory perception.']"""

This compound was not toxic to mice and was inactive against breast tumor xenografts in mice. This inactivity was attributed to hydrolysis of the glycosidic linkage by glycosidases. Here three N-linked (glycosylamide) analogs 2-4, one triazole-linked analog 5 of 1 as well as two diglycosylated analogs 6 and 7 with different stereochemistry at the C2-position of the glycerol moiety were synthesized and their antitumor activity against breast (JIMT-1, BT-474, MDA-MB-231), pancreas (MiaPaCa2) and prostrate (DU145, PC3) cancer cell lines was determined.

In conclusion, the replacement of the O-glycosidic linkage by an N-glycosidic linkage or triazole-linkage resulted in about a two to three fold loss in activity, whereas the replacement of the methoxy group on the glycerol backbone by a second glucosamine moiety did not improve the activity.

The association of pretreatment total testosterone (TT) serum levels with prostate cancer is still a controversial topic. The objective of this study was to investigate potential associations and functional relationships of preoperative TT serum level and pathology-detected Gleason score (pGS).  Materials and methods:   Pretreatment and pathological variables of 220 patients operated with radical prostatectomy were retrospectively reviewed. Age, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), percentage of positive biopsy cores (P+), biopsy Gleason score (bGS), pGS, TT and free testosterone were the continuous variables, while clinical stage (cT: cT1c, cT2/3), biopsy Gleason pattern (bGP: ≤3+3, 3+4, >3+4), pathology Gleason pattern (pGP: ≤3+3, 3+4, >3+4), pathology stage (pT: pT2, pT3a, pT3b), pathology nodal staging (pN: pN0, pN1, pNx) and surgical margin invasion by cancer (R-, R+) were the categorical variables. Statistical methods were computed for assessing associations of TT and pGS; moreover, simple and multiple linear regression analysis (SLRA and MLRA) were used for assessing functional relationships of TT and pGS.  Results:   High-grade tumors (pGS ≥8.0) were associated with bGS >6.0 (p < 0.0001), pGP ≥3+4 (p < 0.0001), P+ >0.31% (p = 0.006), cT2/3 (p = 0.01), TT >15.5 nmol/l (p = 0.0004) and, to a lesser extent, PSA >6.27 μg/l (p = 0.06). The odds ratio (OR) ranked as follows: 2.01 (PSA >6.27 μg/l), 2.88 (cT2/3), 3.23 (P+ >0.31%), 5.53 (TT >15.5 nmol/l) and 12.09 (pGP ≥3+4 and pGS ≥8.0). On SLRA, pGS variation was significantly predicted by bGS (p < 0.0001), P+ (p < 0.0001), PSA (p = 0.0005) and TT (p = 0.02); on MLRA, pGS variation was still significantly predicted by bGS (p < 0.0001), P+ (p = 0.04), PSA (p = 0.03) and TT (p = 0.002). When bGS, P+, PSA and TT were dichotomized to their median value, only bGS (p < 0.0001) and TT (p = 0.001) showed independence in predicting pGS variation. The best model for predicting pGS variations was by dichotomizing TT above its median (>15.5 nmol/l) because the predictive coefficient increased to 0.32, which means that patients with TT >15.5 have a significantly higher estimated risk for high-grade pGS than patients with TT ≤15.5 nmol/l (OR = 1.31).  Conclusion:   In a patient population undergoing radical prostatectomy, increased pretreatment serum measurements of TT are associated with and functionally related to high-grade pGS; moreover, baseline TT together with bGS and PSA are important factors for predicting pGS and assessing high-grade tumors. Baseline TT serum levels might have prognostic potential for assessing treatment response for continuous as well as intermittent androgen deprivation therapy.""","""['Antonio B Porcaro', 'Aldo Petrozziello', 'Claudio Ghimenton', 'Filippo Migliorini', 'Teodoro Sava', 'Beatrice Caruso', 'Mario Romano', 'Stefano Cavalleri', 'Walter Artibani']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Urol Int""","""['Investigative clinical study on prostate cancer part IX and X: estradiol and the pituitary-testicular-prostate axis at the time of initial diagnosis and subsequent cluster selection of the patient population after radical prostatectomy.', 'Serum total testosterone is a significant preoperative variable independently contributing to separating the prostate cancer population into prostatectomy Gleason score groups.', 'Along the pituitary-testis-prostate axis, serum total testosterone is a significant preoperative variable independently contributing to separating the prostate cancer population into prostatectomy Gleason score groups.', 'Prognostic factors in metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Limitations on the interpretation of prostate-specific antigen serum levels.', 'Positive Association between Preoperative Total Testosterone and Lymph Node Invasion in Intermediate Risk Prostate Cancer.', 'The Role of Testosterone Therapy in the Setting of Prostate Cancer.', 'Prostate cancer volume associates with preoperative plasma levels of testosterone that independently predicts high grade tumours which show low densities (quotient testosterone/tumour volume).', 'Simultaneous Measurements of Follicle Stimulating Hormone and Total Testosterone and Associations in Clinically Localized Prostate Cancer.', 'Preoperative Plasma Levels of Total Testosterone Associated with High Grade Pathology-Detected Prostate Cancer: Preliminary Results of a Prospective Study in a Contemporary Cohort of Patients.']"""

TAK-385 possesses higher affinity and more potent antagonistic activity for human and monkey GnRH receptors compared with TAK-013. Both TAK-385 and TAK-013 have low affinity for the rat GnRH receptor, making them difficult to evaluate in rodent models. Here we report the human GnRH receptor knock-in mouse as a humanized model to investigate pharmacological properties of these compounds on gonadal function. Twice-daily oral administration of TAK-013 (10mg/kg) for 4 weeks decreased the weights of testes and ventral prostate in male knock-in mice but not in male wild-type mice, demonstrating the validity of this model to evaluate antagonists for the human GnRH receptor. The same dose of TAK-385 also reduced the prostate weight to castrate levels in male knock-in mice. In female knock-in mice, twice-daily oral administration of TAK-385 (100mg/kg) induced constant diestrous phases within the first week, decreased the uterus weight to ovariectomized levels and downregulated GnRH receptor mRNA in the pituitary after 4 weeks. Gonadal function of TAK-385-treated knock-in mice began to recover after 5 days and almost completely recovered within 14 days after drug withdrawal in both sexes. Our findings demonstrate that TAK-385 acts as an antagonist for human GnRH receptor in vivo and daily oral administration potently, continuously and reversibly suppresses the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. TAK-385 may provide useful therapeutic interventions in hormone-dependent diseases including endometriosis, uterine fibroids and prostate cancer.""","""['Daisuke Nakata', 'Tsuneo Masaki', 'Akira Tanaka', 'Mie Yoshimatsu', 'Yumiko Akinaga', 'Mari Asada', 'Reiko Sasada', 'Michiyasu Takeyama', 'Kazuhiro Miwa', 'Tatsuya Watanabe', 'Masami Kusaka']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Eur J Pharmacol""","""['Suppression of a pituitary-ovarian axis by chronic oral administration of a novel nonpeptide gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist, TAK-013, in cynomolgus monkeys.', 'Effect of SKI2670, a novel, orally active, non-peptide GnRH antagonist, on hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis.', 'Chronic administration of the metastin/kisspeptin analog KISS1-305 or the investigational agent TAK-448 suppresses hypothalamic pituitary gonadal function and depletes plasma testosterone in adult male rats.', 'Progress in Clinical Research on Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone Receptor Antagonists for the Treatment of Prostate Cancer.', 'Investigational and experimental GnRH analogs and associated neurotransmitters.', 'A Randomized Open-Label Study of Relugolix\xa0Alone or Relugolix Combination Therapy in Premenopausal Women.', 'Development of relugolix combination therapy as a medical treatment option for women with uterine fibroids or endometriosis.', 'Synthesis of 3-(Pyridin-2-yl)quinazolin-2,4(1H,3H)-diones via Annulation of Anthranilic Esters with N-pyridyl Ureas.', 'Relugolix: A Review in Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'Relugolix/Estradiol/Norethisterone (Norethindrone) Acetate: A Review in Symptomatic Uterine Fibroids.']"""

Materials and methods:   A total of 84 consecutive patients underwent multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging before radical prostatectomy. The volume of each suspicious area detected on magnetic resonance imaging and of all surgical histological foci was determined by planimetry. We first used each magnetic resonance imaging sequence (T2-weighted, diffusion weighted and dynamic contrast enhanced) and then the sequence showing the largest tumor area (multiparametric volume). Finally, the largest area of any sequence was used to calculate a target volume according to the volume of a cylinder. Agreement between magnetic resonance imaging and pathological findings was assessed by linear regression and residual analysis.  Results:   Histology revealed 99 significant tumors with a volume of greater than 0.2 cc and/or a Gleason score of greater than 6. Of the tumors 16 (16.2%) were undetected by multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging. Linear regression analysis showed that tumor volume estimated by T2-weighted or diffusion weighted imaging correlated significantly with pathological volume (r(2) = 0.82 and 0.83, respectively). Residuals from diffusion weighted imaging volume estimations did not significantly differ from 0. Nevertheless, diffusion weighted imaging underestimated pathological volume in 43 of 87 cases (49%) by a mean of 0.56 cc (range 0.005 to 2.84). Multiparametric and target volumes significantly overestimated pathological volume by a mean of 16% and 44% with underestimation in 28 (32%) and 15 cases (17%), respectively. Volume underestimation was significantly higher for tumor foci less than 0.5 cc. The percent of Gleason grade 4 did not influence tumor volume estimation.

Materials and methods:   We performed a phase III trial of a magnetic resonance imaging/transrectal ultrasound fusion guided prostate biopsy system with participants enrolled between 2012 and 2013. A total of 153 men consented to the study and underwent 3 Tesla multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging with an endorectal coil for clinical suspicion of prostate cancer. Lesions were classified as low or moderate/high risk for prostate cancer. Magnetic resonance imaging/transrectal ultrasound fusion guided biopsy and standard 12-core prostate biopsy were performed and 105 men were eligible for analysis.  Results:   Mean patient age was 65.8 years and mean prostate specific antigen was 9.5 ng/ml. The overall cancer detection rate was 62.9% (66 of 105 patients). The cancer detection rate in those with moderate/high risk on imaging was 72.3% (47 of 65) vs 47.5% (19 of 40) in those classified as low risk for prostate cancer (p<0.05). Mean tumor core length was 4.6 and 3.7 mm for fusion biopsy and standard 12-core biopsy, respectively (p<0.05). Magnetic resonance imaging/transrectal ultrasound fusion guided biopsy detected prostate cancer that was missed by standard 12-core biopsy in 14.3% of cases (15 of 105), of which 86.7% (13 of 15) were clinically significant. This biopsy upgraded 23.5% of cancers (4 of 17) deemed clinically insignificant on 12-core biopsy to clinically significant prostate cancer necessitating treatment.

The goal of this study was to investigate the feasibility of imaging graded levels of Axl expression in tumors using a radiolabeled antibody. We radiolabeled anti-human Axl (Axl mAb) and control IgG1 antibodies with (125)I with high specific radioactivity and radiochemical purity, resulting in an immunoreactive fraction suitable for in vivo studies. Radiolabeled antibodies were investigated in severe combined immunodeficient mice harboring subcutaneous CFPAC (Axl(high)) and Panc1 (Axl(low)) pancreatic cancer xenografts by ex vivo biodistribution and imaging. Based on these results, the specificity of [(125)I]Axl mAb was also validated in mice harboring orthotopic Panc1 or CFPAC tumors and in mice harboring subcutaneous 22Rv1 (Axl(low)) or DU145 (Axl(high)) prostate tumors by ex vivo biodistribution and imaging studies at 72h post-injection of the antibody. Both imaging and biodistribution studies demonstrated specific and persistent accumulation of [(125)I]Axl mAb in Axl(high) (CFPAC and DU145) expression tumors compared to the Axl(low) (Panc1 and 22Rv1) expression tumors. Axl expression in these tumors was further confirmed by immunohistochemical studies.

Our previous study has reported that S1P induces autophagy in human prostate cancer PC-3 cell. In addition, S1P-induced autophagy plays a prosurvival role in PC-3 cells. Accumulating evidence has shown that the autophagy responses triggered by ER stress signaling have cytoprotective effects. Thus, we attempted to investigate whether S1P-induced autophagy is a result of triggering ER stress in PC-3 cells. By monitoring XBP-1 mRNA splicing, a characteristic of ER stress, we demonstrate that S1P triggers ER stress in a concentration-dependent and time-dependent manner. Moreover, DiH S1P, a membrane-nonpermeable S1P analog without intracellular effects also enhances ER stress. Meanwhile, we also show that S1P5 is required for S1P-induced ER stress by using RNA interference experiments. Furthermore, signaling analyses revealed that PI3K, PLC, and ROS production were involved in S1P's effects on ER stress induction. On the other hand, knockdown of XBP-1 abolished S1P-induced autophagy. In summary, our results demonstrate for the first time that the extracellular S1P-triggered ER stress is responsible for autophagy induction in PC-3 cells.""","""['Yuan-Li Huang', 'Chi-Lun Chang', 'Chih-Hsin Tang', 'Yueh-Chien Lin', 'Tsai-Kai Ju', 'Wei-Pang Huang', 'Hsinyu Lee']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Cell Signal""","""['S1P(5) is required for sphingosine 1-phosphate-induced autophagy in human prostate cancer PC-3 cells.', 'Sphingosine 1-phosphate signaling through its receptor S1P5 promotes chromosome segregation and mitotic progression.', 'Sphingosine-1-phosphate Attenuates Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress-induced Cardiomyocyte Apoptosis Through Sphingosine-1-phosphate Receptor 1.', 'Sphingosine-1-phosphate signaling in physiology and diseases.', 'Sphingosine 1-phosphate signalling in cancer.', 'The endoplasmic reticulum stress response in prostate cancer.', 'Sphingosine 1-Phosphate Receptor 5 (S1P5) Deficiency Promotes Proliferation and Immortalization of Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts.', 'Targeting autophagy in prostate cancer: preclinical and clinical evidence for therapeutic response.', 'Keep a Little Fire Burning-The Delicate Balance of Targeting Sphingosine-1-Phosphate in Cancer Immunity.', 'Unraveling the Molecular Nexus between GPCRs, ERS, and EMT.']"""

Results:   A total of 3,073 men underwent PCA3 analysis before initial prostate biopsy sampling of 12 to 14 areas. Mean PCA3 was 27.2 and 52.5 for patients without and with cancer, respectively.

The prostate was subdivided into 14 sectors and mp-MRI findings assessed using a five-level subjective suspicion score (SSS). Biopsy included targeted samples of abnormal sectors and systematic samples of normal peripheral zone sectors.  Results:   Two hundred and eighty-eight patients were included [153 biopsy naïve, 135 with negative (n = 51) or positive (n = 84) prior biopsy]. Biopsy was positive in 168 patients. mp-MRI area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) was 69.1% (95% CI: 67.1-70.9%), 72.5% (95% CI: 69.5-76%), and 73.8% (95% CI: 68.3-79.3%) at per sector, per lobe, and per patient analysis, respectively. At the per sector level, the AUC was significantly larger if detection was limited to cancers with a Gleason score of ≥7 (72.6%; 95% CI: 69.8-75.8%; p < 0.01) or ≥8 (87.1%; 95% CI: 78.3-95.7%; p < 0.01). mp-MRI performance was significantly influenced by prostate volume (p = 0.02), the presence of a concordant hypoechoic area (p < 0.001), but not by prostate-specific antigen (PSA) value, status of prior biopsy, or radiologists' experience. SSS was significantly associated with the Gleason score in true-positive lobes and patients (p < 0.0001). Using a SSS threshold of ≥3, cancer was missed in 13/102 lobes and 4/72 patients with cancers of Gleason score ≥7.  Conclusion:   mp-MRI provides a good detection of cancers with a Gleason score of ≥7 in candidates suitable for prostate biopsy.""","""['H Habchi', 'F Bratan', 'A Paye', 'G Pagnoux', 'T Sanzalone', 'F Mège-Lechevallier', 'S Crouzet', 'M Colombel', 'M Rabilloud', 'O Rouvière']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Clin Radiol""","""['Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging of the prostate can improve the predictive value of the urinary prostate cancer antigen 3 test in patients with elevated prostate-specific antigen levels and a previous negative biopsy.', 'Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging outperforms the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial risk calculator in predicting clinically significant prostate cancer.', 'Value of 3-T multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance-guided biopsy for early risk restratification in active surveillance of low-risk prostate cancer: a prospective multicenter cohort study.', 'Prostate biopsy: who, how and when.

The objective of this study was to test the role of the quality of the physician-patient relationship in the choice to be followed by active surveillance, rather than receive definitive therapy (e.g., surgery and radiation). We hypothesized that patients would have been more influenced by their physicians' treatment recommendations to the degree that they held more positive perceptions of their relationship with their physicians, independent of treatment recommended.  Methods and materials:   Patients with PCa (n = 120) being followed with active surveillance at a comprehensive cancer center completed self-report assessments of their treatment decision-making process. Generalized estimating equations were used to model the association between participants' perceptions of their relationships with their physicians and influence of these physicians' recommendations on their treatment decision.  Results:   After controlling for the type of treatment recommended, Gleason score, and education, 3 predictors, trust in the physician, perceived closeness with the physician, and the degree to which the physician shared control over treatment decision making, were associated with greater influence of physician's treatment recommendation. Receiving a recommendation for active surveillance, compared with definitive therapy, was also associated with higher perceived trust, closeness, shared control over treatment decision making, lower likelihood of having been treated poorly by a physician, and greater influence of physician's treatment recommendation.  Conclusions:   There is increasing concern that patients with relatively less aggressive PCa, older age, or serious comorbidities are being unnecessarily treated with surgery or radiation, putting them at risk for side effects, and contributing to high health care costs. When active surveillance is an appropriate course of treatment, the quality of patients' relationships with their physicians may be a determinant of following a recommendation for active surveillance. Results may have implications for treatment uptake in general, indicating that the quality of the physician-patient relationship, including trust, closeness, shared decision making--all elements of patient-centered care--may be important motivators of treatment adoption and adherence.""","""['Heather Orom', 'D Lynn Homish', 'Gregory G Homish', 'Willie Underwood rd']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""[""Men's perspectives on selecting their prostate cancer treatment."", 'Relationships as Medicine: Quality of the Physician-Patient Relationship Determines Physician Influence on Treatment Recommendation Adherence.', 'Pairing physician education with patient activation to improve shared decisions in prostate cancer screening: a cluster randomized controlled trial.', 'Patient and disease factors affecting the choice and adherence to active surveillance.', 'Living with untreated prostate cancer: predictors of quality of life.', 'Impact of a Genomic Test on Treatment Decision in a Predominantly African American Population With Favorable-Risk Prostate Cancer: A Randomized Trial.', 'Selecting Active Surveillance: Decision Making Factors for Men with a Low-Risk Prostate Cancer.', 'What Do Primary Healthcare Providers and Complementary and Alternative Medicine Practitioners in Palestine Need to Know about Exercise for Cancer Patients and Survivors: A Consensual Study Using the Delphi Technique.', 'Factors underlying treatment decision-making for localized prostate cancer in the U.S. and Canada: A scoping review using principal component analysis.', 'Too much medicine: not enough trust?']"""

In this study, we investigated to which degree this life-expectancy increase was translated into lower competing mortality rates after radical prostatectomy.  Methods and materials:   The study sample comprised 6,831 consecutive patients who underwent radical prostatectomy at the Department of Urology of the Dresden University of Technology and the Department of Urology of the University of Hamburg/Martini Clinic in the years 1992 to 2005. The median age was 63.0 years and the median follow-up was 8.6 years. Three time periods (1992-1995, 1996-2001, and 2002-2005) were compared. Competing mortality was the study end point. Rates after 8 years were used for comparison. Comparisons of mortality rates were made with the 2-sided Wald test.  Results:   The 8-year competing mortality rates decreased from 7.6% (1992-1995) via 5.6% (1996-2001) to 4.7% (2002-2005 vs. 1992-1995; P = 0.0127). When deaths due to unknown causes (92 of 969 deaths) were considered as non-prostate cancer competing deaths, the corresponding figures were 9.0 % (1992-1995), 6.5% (1996-2001), and 5.6% (2002-2005) vs. 1992 to 1995; P = 0.0107. The effect was greater in men who are 65 years of age or older and those of East German origin.

Multivariable logistic and linear regression models were used to quantify the effect of BMI on pathologic and functional outcomes.  Results:   Compared with normal weight patients, overweight and obese patients demonstrated higher pathologic Gleason grade and higher pathologic T stage, without any difference in preoperative prostate-specific antigen levels. Overweight and obese men were less likely to have a negative surgical margin (odds ratio (OR) 0.74 [confidence interval (CI) 0.65-0.84, P<0.001] for overweight men and OR 0.66 [CI 0.49-0.89, P<0.01] for obese men) and had a lower rate of postoperative erectile function (OR 0.60 [CI 0.48-0.76, P<0.001] for overweight patients and OR 0.34 [CI 0.27-0.44, P<0.001] for obese patients). Moreover, duration of surgery and intraoperative blood loss increased significantly with an increase in BMI. When using BMI as a continuous variable, the same trends were demonstrated. However, a lower rate of continence was not evident for overweight or obese men.

Patients and methods:   The cohort consisted of 758 referred subjects who underwent RPE between 2000 and 2005 at the University of Muenster. The mean time of follow-up was 62 months. TV, TP, and NF were estimated visually with the assistance of a pathologic mapping grid for embedded whole-mount RPE specimens. In addition, TV and TP were assessed in a categorized fashion by using quartiles as cutoff points. Subgroup analyses for high- and low-risk patients using univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard analyses for BCR were performed.  Results:   TV, TP, and NF were strongly related to tumor stage, Gleason score, surgical margin status, and preoperative prostate-specific antigen (PSA). In univariate analysis, all pathologic parameters including TV, TP, and NF were predictive for BCR. In multivariate analysis, only TP, tumor stage, and PSA level were independent predictors. In subgroup analysis, TP was an independent predictor for BCR in the high-risk group but not in the low-risk group.  Conclusions:   TP, but not TV or NF, was found to be an independent predictor for BCR in patients after RPE.

Some of these loci include candidate susceptibility genes, such as MSMB, HNF1β, and C-terminal-binding protein (CtBP2). Except for MSMB, the clinicopathological significance of these genes has not been investigated. We therefore aimed to analyze their expression in PCa tissues, in relation with tumor progression and aggressiveness.  Methods and materials:   Protein expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays containing samples from normal prostate (NL, n = 91), high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN, n = 61), clinically localized PCa (CLC, n = 434), PCa metastases (M, n = 28), and castration-resistant PCa (CRC, n = 49). Moreover, mRNA expression for each marker was assessed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, on 53 frozen samples of NL, CLC, and CRC.  Results:   These genes were differentially expressed at the different stages of PCa natural history. MSMB expression decreased with disease development and progression. In contrast, nuclear HNF1β and CtBP2 staining significantly increased in the CRC and M groups when compared with CLC, together with the transcripts levels. In patients with CLC, HNF1β and CtBP2 nuclear expressions were strongly associated with cancer cell proliferation. After adjusting for the Gleason score and the pathological stage, none of the candidate genes was significantly predictive of recurrence after radical prostatectomy. In patients with CRC, CtBP2 nuclear staining was associated with shorter overall survival.  Conclusions:   The decrease of MSMB expression during tumor progression strongly supports its role as a tumor-suppressor gene. Although its functions remain to be clarified in PCa cells, HNF1β and CtBP2 are associated with cancer cell proliferation, tumor progression, and castration-resistant disease.""","""['Celine Debiais-Delpech', 'Julie Godet', 'Nathalie Pedretti', 'François-Xavier Bernard', 'Jacques Irani', 'Xavier Cathelineau', 'Olivier Cussenot', 'Gaelle Fromont']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Expression of store-operated channel components in prostate cancer: the prognostic paradox.', 'Endosomal gene expression: a new indicator for prostate cancer patient prognosis?', 'Klf4 transcription factor is expressed in the cytoplasm of prostate cancer cells.', 'MicroRNA in prostate cancer: Practical aspects.', 'Global DNA hypomethylation in prostate cancer development and progression: a systematic review.', 'Comprehensive quantitative analysis of alternative splicing variants reveals the HNF1B mRNA splicing pattern in various tumour and non-tumour tissues.', 'HNF1B, EZH2 and ECI2 in prostate carcinoma.

In this study, the characteristics and suitability of 3DVH for an IMRT DQA process were evaluated by assessment of clinically applied results. The DQA plans were prepared with a 2D diode detector array (MapCHECK 2) for 20 IMRT patients (10 with head and neck cancer and 10 with prostate cancer), and the matching rate between the calculated dose and the measured dose was analyzed. The relative dose differences between the original IMRT plan and the recalculated plan by 3DVH were evaluated for tumor target and organs at risk (OARs). Confidence limits (CLs) were determined for quantification of the degree of agreement that should be expected in each DQA method. The individual CLs for DQA accuracy of 3D dosimetric evaluation in the tumor target and OARs were also calculated to evaluate the differences compared with conventional 2D-based DQA results. The matching rates were sufficient to validate the accuracy of IMRT DQA analyses and the calculated CL values were reasonable values considering the normal criteria of our institution. The 3DVH analysis generally had better matching rate than per-field measurement analysis and the CL values for OARs were better than those for the planning target volume (PTV). The usefulness of the 3DVH tool was verified for IMRT DQA from the point of view of dose evaluation in the corresponding patient's CT data.

Material and methods:   Thirteen prostatectomized prostate cancer patients, after implanting four gold seed fiducials into their prostate bed, were imaged daily using a pretreatment cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT). Linear and the rotational prostate bed motion (PBM) was measured for 466 CBCTs.  Results:   The linear PBM mean and standard deviation values in millimeters are 0.0 ± 0.5, 0.7 ± 2.1 and 0.8 ± 1.6 in the LR, SI and AP axes, respectively. In 20% of the fractions the rotation of the prostate bed in sagittal plane exceeds ±6° and in 5% it exceeds ±10° from the position on the planning CT. In the transversal and coronal planes 1% and 2% of it exceeds ±6°. The PTV margins are 2.4, 6.5 and 6.6mm in the LR, SI and AP axes, respectively, if imaging is performed for the first three treatment fractions.  Conclusion:   The linear PBM is largest in the SI and AP axis, whereas the rotation is largest in the sagittal plane.

Using 6mm CTV-PTV margins, planning constraints were met for all fifteen datasets. Using 8mm margins required relaxation of the uppermost bladder constraint in three cases to achieve adequate coverage, and, compared to 6mm margins, rectal and bladder doses significantly increased.

For this purpose, widely applied radiobiological models and dosimetric measures were used to associate their results with clinical findings.  Methods and materials:   The dose distributions of 12 clinical high-dose-rate brachytherapy implants for prostate were evaluated in relation to different fractionation schemes. The fractionation schemes compared were: (1) 1 fraction of 20 Gy; (2) 2 fractions of 14 Gy; (3) 3 fractions of 11 Gy; and (4) 4 fractions of 9.5 Gy. The clinical effectiveness of the different fractionation schemes was estimated through the complication-free tumor control probability (P+), the biologically effective uniform dose, and the generalized equivalent uniform dose index.  Results:   For the different fractionation schemes, the tumor control probabilities were 98.5% in 1×20 Gy, 98.6% in 2×14 Gy, 97.5% in 3×11 Gy, and 97.8% in 4×9.5 Gy. The corresponding P+ values were 88.8% in 1×20 Gy, 83.9% in 2×14 Gy, 86.0% in 3×11 Gy, and 82.3% in 4×9.5 Gy. With use of the fractionation scheme 4×9.5 Gy as reference, the isoeffective schemes regarding tumor control for 1, 2, and 3 fractions were 1×19.68 Gy, 2×13.75 Gy, and 3×11.05 Gy. The optimum fractionation schemes for 1, 2, 3, and 4 fractions were 1×19.16 Gy with a P+ of 91.8%, 2×13.2 Gy with a P+ of 89.6%, 3×10.6 Gy with a P+ of 88.4%, and 4×9.02 Gy with a P+ of 86.9%.  Conclusions:   Among the fractionation schemes 1×20 Gy, 2×14 Gy, 3×11 Gy, and 4×9.5 Gy, the first scheme was more effective in terms of P+. After performance of a radiobiological optimization, it was shown that a single fraction of 19.2 to 19.7 Gy (average 19.5 Gy) should produce at least the same benefit as that given by the 4×9.5 Gy scheme, and it should reduce the expected total complication probability by approximately 40% to 55%.""","""['Panayiotis Mavroidis', 'Natasa Milickovic', 'Wilbert F Cruz', 'Nikolaos Tselis', 'Andreas Karabis', 'Sotirios Stathakis', 'Nikos Papanikolaou', 'Nikolaos Zamboglou', 'Dimos Baltas']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Dosimetric considerations to determine the optimal technique for localized prostate cancer among external photon, proton, or carbon-ion therapy and high-dose-rate or low-dose-rate brachytherapy.', 'Dosimetric and radiobiological consequences of computed tomography-guided adaptive strategies for intensity modulated radiation therapy of the prostate.', 'Helical tomotherapy vs. intensity-modulated proton therapy for whole pelvis irradiation in high-risk prostate cancer patients: dosimetric, normal tissue complication probability, and generalized equivalent uniform dose analysis.', 'The radiobiology of prostate cancer including new aspects of fractionated radiotherapy.', 'Compendium of fractionation choices for gynecologic HDR brachytherapy-An American Brachytherapy Society Task Group Report.', 'Feasibility of MRI targeted single fraction HDR brachytherapy for localized prostate carcinoma: ProFocAL-study.', 'Patient and physician reported toxicity with two-fraction definitive high-dose-rate prostate brachytherapy: the impact of implant interval.', 'A radiobiological study of the schemes with a low number of fractions in high-dose-rate brachytherapy as monotherapy for prostate cancer.', 'A Phase 2 Randomized Pilot Study Comparing High-Dose-Rate Brachytherapy and Low-Dose-Rate Brachytherapy as Monotherapy in Localized Prostate Cancer.', 'The alfa and beta of tumours: a review of parameters of the linear-quadratic model, derived from clinical radiotherapy studies.']"""

We examined the role of the PTEN/PDGF axis on radioresponse using a murine PTEN null prostate epithelial cell model.  Methods and materials:   PTEN wild-type (PTEN+/+) and PTEN knockout (PTEN-/-) murine prostate epithelial cell lines were used to examine the relationship between the PTEN status and radiosensitivity and also to modulate the PDGF D expression levels. PTEN-/- cells were transduced with a small hairpin RNA (shRNA) lentiviral vector containing either scrambled nucleotides (SCRM) or sequences targeted to PDGF D (shPDGF D). Tumorigenesis and morphogenesis of these cell lines were evaluated in vivo via subcutaneous injection of male nude mice and in vitro using Matrigel 3-dimensional (3D) culture. Effects of irradiation on clonogenic survival, cell migration, and invasion were measured with respect to the PTEN status and the PDGF D expression level. In addition, apoptosis and cell cycle redistribution were examined as potential mechanisms for differences seen.  Results:   PTEN-/- cells were highly tumorigenic in animals and effectively formed foci in 3D culture. Importantly, loss of PDGF D in these cell lines drastically diminished these phenotypes. Furthermore, PTEN-/- cells demonstrated increased clonogenic survival in vitro compared to PTEN+/+, and attenuation of PDGF D significantly reversed this radioresistant phenotype. PTEN-/- cells displayed greater migratory and invasive potential at baseline as well as after irradiation. Both the basal and radiation-induced migratory and invasive phenotypes in PTEN-/- cells required PDGF D expression. Interestingly, these differences were independent of apoptosis and cell cycle redistribution, as they showed no significant difference.  Conclusions:   We propose that PDGF D represents a potentially promising target for PCa treatment resistance in the absence of PTEN function, and warrants further laboratory evaluation and clinical study.""","""['Michael Christensen', 'Abdo J Najy', 'Michael Snyder', 'Lisa S Movilla', 'Hyeong-Reh Choi Kim']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['The interaction between androgen receptor and PDGF-D in the radiation response of prostate carcinoma.', 'PTEN regulates PDGF ligand switch for β-PDGFR signaling in prostate cancer.', 'Differential tumorigenic potential and matriptase activation between PDGF B versus PDGF D in prostate cancer.', 'Emerging roles of PDGF-D signaling pathway in tumor development and progression.', 'Cell signalling and radiation survival: the impact of protein phosphatases.', 'Understanding the Radiobiology of Vestibular Schwannomas to Overcome Radiation Resistance.', 'ATM Kinase Inhibition Preferentially Sensitises PTEN-Deficient Prostate Tumour Cells to Ionising Radiation.', 'Blood prognostic predictors of treatment response for patients with papillary thyroid cancer.', 'The interplay between cancer associated fibroblasts and immune cells in the context of radiation therapy.', 'Overexpressing TPTE2 (TPIP), a homolog of the human tumor suppressor gene PTEN, rescues the abnormal phenotype of the PTEN-/- mutant.']"""

Methods and materials:   Between 1998 and 2008, 2223 patients with low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancer received LDR-PB monotherapy. A cohort of 1434 of these patients was identified with a documented 48mPSA and no evidence of disease relapse prior to the 48mPSA. In addition, a subset of this cohort (n=585) was identified with ≥72 months of follow-up and documented PSA values at both 24 and 36 months after implantation.  Results:   Median follow-up time was 76 months. Eight-year Kaplan-Meier disease-free survival (DFS) rates were 100% vs 73.4% for patients with 48mPSA≤0.2 vs those with >0.2 ng/mL; 99.1% versus 53.8% for a 48mPSA threshold of ≤0.4 versus >0.4 ng/mL, respectively; and 97.3% versus 0% for a threshold of ≤1.0 versus >1.0 ng/mL, respectively. On multivariate analysis, the only factor predictive of DFS was 48mPSA (P<.0001). On subset analysis (n=585), 29 patients had a PSA rise (defined as >0.2 ng/mL) between 24 and 36 months, 24 patients had a rise between 36 and 48 months, and 11 patients had rises over both intervals. Failure rates in these patients were 52%, 79%, and 100%, respectively. On multivariate analysis, initial PSA, androgen deprivation therapy, and dose to 90% of the prostate significantly correlated with 48mPSA but together accounted for only ∼5% of its total variance.  Conclusions:   The 48mPSA after LDR-PB is highly predictive of long-term DFS. Patients with 48mPSA≤0.4 ng/mL had a <1% risk of disease relapse at 8 years, whereas all patients with 48mPSA>1.0 ng/mL relapsed.

Patients and methods:   Inclusion criteria for this retrospective study were (1) presence of prostate cancer, (2) referral for first radiotherapy course (for primary or recurrent tumor) between February 2007 and July 2010, and (3) performance of cho-PET/CT. All cho-PET/CT scans were classified according to whether they were positive in the prostate/prostate bed (T), pelvic lymph nodes (N), and distant metastases (M) or negative. Therapeutic strategy based on the cho-PET/CT evaluation was compared with the strategy that would have been proposed had cho-PET/CT imaging not been available, following international and national prostate cancer guidelines.  Results:   Eighty-two cho-PET/CT scans performed in 74 patients were analyzed. Cho-PET/CT was positive in 49 studies (60%): T only in 22 (45% of all positive studies); N only in 4 (8%); T in combination with N in 3 (6%); and M in combination with T or N, or both, in 16 (33%). Treatment after positive cho-PET/CT examination included radiotherapy ± androgen deprivation (29 patients), surgery ± radiotherapy (6 patients), androgen deprivation only (8 patients), and other treatment (6 patients).

We sought to examine the influence of delayed DVC ligation versus standard DVC ligation on the apical surgical margin status and other key surgical parameters following RALP.  Materials and methods:   The Columbia University Urologic Oncology Database was retrospectively reviewed to identify patients who underwent RALP between 2008-2011. Operative records were analyzed to determine whether the DVC was ligated in the 'standard' or 'delayed' manner. The standard group had the DVC ligated prior to the apical dissection; in the delayed group, the DVC was initially transected and subsequently oversewn after completion of the apical dissection. Clinical and pathologic data was retrospectively evaluated and stratified by the type of DVC ligation to compare positive apical margin rates based on DVC-control technique.  Results:   A total of 244 patients were identified, including 118 in the standard group and 126 in the delayed group. Estimated blood loss (112 mL versus 122 mL), operative time (132 min versus 126 min), and postoperative continence rates (81% versus 84% at 3 months) were similar between the standard and delayed DVC groups (p = NS). Apical margin status was also similar in the two groups, with 3.4% having a positive surgical margin in the standard DVC ligation arm, and 1.6% having a positive margin in the delayed DVC ligation arm (p = 0.43).  Conclusions:   Delayed DVC ligation after apical dissection is a safe approach with comparable surgical outcomes during RALP. From a technical standpoint, we feel it allows for improved visualization of the apical dissection and therefore has become standard practice at our institution.""","""['Solomon L Woldu', 'Trushar Patel', 'Edan Y Shapiro', 'Ari M Bergman', 'Ketan K Badani']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Can J Urol""","""['Athermal division and selective suture ligation of the dorsal vein complex during robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy: description of technique and outcomes.', 'Suture versus staple ligation of the dorsal venous complex during robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.', 'Selective versus standard ligature of the deep venous complex during laparoscopic radical prostatectomy: effects on continence, blood loss, and margin status.', 'Radical prostatectomy: a comparison of open, laparoscopic and robot-assisted laparoscopic techniques.', 'Robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy: a review of current outcomes.', 'The progress of dorsal vascular complex control strategy in radical prostatectomy.', 'Standard vs delayed ligature of the dorsal vascular complex during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: results from a randomized controlled trial.']"""

In this study, we explore the utility of an ARS as an educational tool in the setting of a large urology conference.  Materials and methods:   At the 2011 joint meeting of the Mid-Atlantic and New England sections of the American Urological Association, conference attendees were able to use a web-based and cell-phone accessed ARS. At the meeting, six ARS questions were asked during five point-counterpoint debate topics covering areas of prostate cancer, incontinence, pediatrics, stone disease, and renal cancer. Questions were presented by expert representatives from each of the sections; questions were structured as management options for predefined cases. At the beginning and end of each 15-minute session, attendees were asked to use the ARS to select the best management option.  Results:   In five out of the six questions (83%) more than 10% of responses were changed following the presentation of the point-counterpoint session and a > 25% change in response was noted in two out of the six questions (33%). A statistically significant change was noted for one question relating to management of urolithiasis in pregnancy (p = 0.037).

Materials and methods:   We studied 714 patients treated with BT with or without external radiotherapy. DT was defined as no treatment for > 350 days after the first biopsy with cancer. Factors influencing DT were analyzed. PSA outcome was assessed only in patients with a follow up ≥ 24 months. Patients with DT were compared to patients treated < 350 days using non-parametric tests. Multivariate analysis was performed using linear-regression analysis.  Results:   BT was deferred in 125 patients (17.5%) for a median of 607 days (IQR 445-926). Patients with DT were older (71 years versus 69 years, p = 0.04) and had significantly less aggressive disease (percentage of positive biopsies, T1 disease, Gleason 6) on univariate analysis. On multivariate analysis, age (p = 0.01) and Gleason score (p = 0.05) were predictive for DT. Median (range) PSA follow up for DT patients was 36 months (24-78). The rate of patients with DT attaining a PSA at last follow up of < 0.2 ng/mL, < 0.5 ng/mL and ≤ 1 ng/mL was 53%, 73 % and 95%, respectively; only one patient (1.6 %) had biochemical failure (p = 0.61 compared to immediate BT).

Materials and methods:   We applied a systematic search process to identify 270 weblinks associated with PT for prostate cancer, categorized the websites by source, and filtered the results to 50 websites using predetermined criteria. We then used a customized version of the DISCERN instrument, a validated tool for assessing the quality of consumer health information, to evaluate the remaining websites for balance of content and description of risks, benefits and uncertainty.  Results:   Depending on the search engine and key word used, proton center websites (PCWs) made up 10%-47% of the first 30 encountered links. In comparison, websites from academic and nonacademic medical centers without ownership stake in proton centers appeared much less frequently as a search result (0%-3%). PCWs scored lower on DISCERN questions compared to other sources for being balanced/unbiased (p < 0.001), mentioning areas of uncertainty (p < 0.001), and describing risks of PT (p < 0.001). PCWs scored higher for describing the benefits of treatment (p = 0.003).

Materials and methods:   A weighted estimate of 15,367 patients with metastatic prostate cancer who presented to the ED between January 1, 2006 and December 31, 2009 was abstracted from the Nationwide Emergency Department Sample (NEDS). Descriptive statistics were used to elaborate patient and hospital characteristics of the metastatic prostate cancer population and logistic regression models were fitted to identify predictors of admission.  Results:   The most common site of metastasis in patients with metastatic prostate cancer presenting to the ED was bone (80.6%), followed by liver (13.2%), lung (9.3) and other genitourinary sites (8.1%). Over the study period, there was an increase in prevalence of the four commonest metastatic sites, and admission rates varied between metastatic sites (83.2% for bone to 95.2% for nodal metastasis). Substantial variability in the rate of inpatient mortality was noted. Increasing age, Northeast region, increased comorbidity burden, and the presence of nodal metastases and other urinary metastases were shown to be independent predictors of hospital admission.

Genistein, a predominant isoflavone found in soy products, has multiple robust anti-tumor effects in various cancers, especially in the breast and prostate cancer. In this study, we aimed to evaluate genistein inhibition of BCSCs and its potential mechanism by culturing MCF-7 breast cancer cells and implanting these cells into nude mice.  Methods:   Cell counting, colony formation and cell apoptosis analysis were used to evaluate the effect of genistein on breast cancer cells’ growth, proliferation and apoptosis. We then used mammosphere formation assay and CD44CD24 staining to evaluate the effect of genistein on BCSCs in vitro. A nude mice xenograft model was employed to determine whether genistein could target BCSCs in vivo, as assessed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and immunohistochemical staining. The potential mechanism was investigated utilizing real-time PCR, western blotting analysis and immunohistochemical staining.  Results:   Genistein inhibited the MCF-7 breast cancer cells’ growth and proliferation and promoted apoptosis. Both in vitro and in vivo genistein decreased breast cancer stem cells, and inhibited breast cancer stem-like cells through down-regulation of the Hedgehog-Gli1 Signaling Pathway.  Conclusions:   We demonstrated for the first time that genistein inhibits BCSCs by down-regulating Hedgehog-Gli1 signaling pathway.

Methods:   The proliferation, apoptosis and invasion abilities of PC-3 and LNCaP cells treated with I131-PSCA-mAb were measured by methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium assay, flow cytometry and transwell culture, respectively. The human prostate cancer models were established by orthotopic implantation of PC-3 and LNCaP cells in nude mice. I131-PSCA-mAb distribution and tumor cell apoptosis in the tumor-bearing nude mice were measured.  Results:   The inhibitory and apoptosis rates of PC-3 and LNCaP cells treated with I131-PSCA-mAb reached a maximum of 84%, 80% and 50%, 46%, respectively, which were obviously higher than in the cells treated with I131-IgG or PSCA-mAb.

Here we demonstrate that Id4, an HLH transcriptional regulator and a tumor suppressor, can restore the mutant p53 transcriptional activity in prostate cancer cells.  Methods:   Id4 was over-expressed in prostate cancer cell line DU145 harboring mutant p53 (P223L and V274F) and silenced in LNCaP cells with wild type p53. The cells were used to quantitate apoptosis, p53 localization, p53 DNA binding and transcriptional activity. Immuno-precipitation/-blot studies were performed to demonstrate interactions between Id4, p53 and CBP/p300 and acetylation of specific lysine residues within p53.  Results:   Ectopic expression of Id4 in DU145 cells resulted in increased apoptosis and expression of BAX, PUMA and p21, the transcriptional targets of p53. Mutant p53 gained DNA binding and transcriptional activity in the presence of Id4 in DU145 cells. Conversely, loss of Id4 in LNCaP cells abrogated wild type p53 DNA binding and transactivation potential. Gain of Id4 resulted in increased acetylation of mutant p53 whereas loss of Id4 lead to decreased acetylation in DU145 and LNCaP cells respectively. Id4 dependent acetylation of p53 was in part due to a physical interaction between Id4, p53 and acetyl-transferase CBP/p300.  Conclusions:   Taken together, our results suggest that Id4 regulates the activity of wild type and mutant p53. Id4 promoted the assembly of a macromolecular complex involving CBP/P300 that resulted in acetylation of p53 at K373, a critical post-translational modification required for its biological activity.""","""['Ashley E Knowell', 'Divya Patel', 'Derrick J Morton', 'Pankaj Sharma', 'Shanora Glymph', 'Jaideep Chaudhary']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Mol Cancer""","""['ID4 regulates transcriptional activity of wild type and mutant p53 via K373 acetylation.', 'Inhibitor of differentiation 4 (Id4) is a potential tumor suppressor in prostate cancer.', 'Inhibitor of differentiation 4 (ID4) acts as an inhibitor of ID-1, -2 and -3 and promotes basic helix loop helix (bHLH) E47 DNA binding and transcriptional activity.', 'Acetylation of p53 at lysine 373/382 by the histone deacetylase inhibitor depsipeptide induces expression of p21(Waf1/Cip1).', 'p300/CBP/p53 interaction and regulation of the p53 response.', 'Acetylation halts missense mutant p53 aggregation and rescues tumor suppression in non-small cell lung cancers.', 'Loss of peptidase D binding restores the tumor suppressor functions of oncogenic p53 mutants.', 'Post-Translational Modifications That Drive Prostate Cancer Progression.', 'Cancer Stemness: p53 at the Wheel.', 'Chemical Decorations of ""MARs"" Residents in Orchestrating Eukaryotic Gene Regulation.']"""

Methods/design:   Using a single-center randomized controlled design, 80 men with histologically confirmed locally advanced or disseminated prostate cancer undergoing ADT for 6 months or more at The Copenhagen University Hospital will be enrolled on this trial. After baseline assessments eligible participants will be randomly assigned to a soccer training group or a control group receiving usual care. The soccer intervention will consist of 12 weeks of training 2-3 times/week for 45-60 min after which the assessment protocol will be repeated. Soccer training will then continue bi-weekly for an additional 20 weeks at the end of which all measures will be repeated to allow for additional analyses of long-term effects. The primary endpoint is changes in lean body mass from baseline to 12 weeks assessed by dual X-ray absorptiometry scan. Secondary endpoints include changes of cardiovascular, metabolic, and physical function parameters, as well as markers of bone metabolism and patient-reported outcomes.  Discussion:   The FC Prostate trial will assess the safety and efficacy of a novel soccer-training approach to cancer rehabilitation on a number of clinically important health outcomes in men with advanced prostate cancer during ADT. The results may pave the way for innovative, community-based interventions in the approach to treating prostate cancer.

Methods:   Patients with histologically proven adenocarcinoma of the prostate, intermediate prognostic category, were enrolled in this study. Early and late toxicity were scored according to the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program, Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, Version 3.0. Treatment outcome was stated in terms of biochemical failure, biopsy result and clinical failure.  Results:   39 patients with a median follow-up of 71 months were analyzed. No patient experienced G3 or G4 acute gastrointestinal (GI) or genitourinary (GU) toxicity. G2 acute GI and GU toxicity were observed in 17 (44%) and 20 (51%) patients, respectively. Fourteen patients (36%) did not experience acute GI toxicity and 4 patients (10%) did not experience acute GU toxicity. G2 late GI bleeding occurred in 7 of 39 patients (18%). Both G3 and G4 late GI toxicity were seen only in one patient (2.5%). Two patients (5%) experienced G2 late GU toxicity, while G3 late GU toxicity occurred in 3 patients (8%). The 5-year actuarial freedom from biochemical failure (FFBF) was 87%. Thirty-four patients (87%) did not show biochemical relapse. Seventeen patients (44%) underwent biopsy two year after radiotherapy; of these only two were non-negative and both did not show evidence of biochemical disease.  Conclusions:   IMRT treatment of patients with localized intermediate-risk prostate cancer at high dose levels without using androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) seems to give good disease control.

Methods and results:   A tissue microarray cohort comprising 940 tumour samples, of which 502 were metastatic lesions, representing tumours from 18 different organs and four non-localized cancer types, was analysed using immunohistochemistry with 27 well-established antibodies used in clinical differential diagnostics. Few antibodies, e.g. prostate-specific antigen and thyroglobulin, showed a cancer type-related sensitivity and specificity of more than 95%. A majority of the antibodies showed a low degree of sensitivity and specificity for defined cancer types. Combinations of antibodies provided limited added value for differential diagnostics of cancer types.  Conclusions:   The results from analysing 27 diagnostic antibodies on consecutive sections of 940 defined tumours provide a unique repository of data that can empower a more optimal use of clinical immunohistochemistry.

Medical records 2306 MtoF treated between 1975 and 2006 of the Amsterdam Gender Clinic were reviewed. Mean age at initiation of treatment was 29.3 ± 12.7 years (range 16-83). Mean follow-up was 21.4 years, resulting in a combined total of 51 173 person-years of exposure and follow-up. Follow-up more than 20 years was available for 303 individuals, including follow-up of more than 30 years in 151 individuals. A single case of PCa was identified in this group. The overall incidence of PCa in this population was 0.04% and 0.13% for individuals who had initiated hormonal treatment after at 40 years or later. PCa in this large MtoF population was rare. However, underdiagnosis is likely due to lack of close prostate monitoring and suppression of PSA due to androgen deprivation. In addition, only a limited number of MtoF individuals have yet reached old age when PCa becomes more common. When diagnosed in this population, there appears to be a tendency for PCa to behave aggressively.

Few papers focus on the prevalence of operative and short-term postoperative (<30 days) adverse events associated with RALP in high-risk patients. The objective of this study was to study such events in high-risk patients using intermediate- and low-risk patients as contrast groups.  Material and methods:   In total, 1076 patients who underwent RALP at Oslo University Hospital, Radiumhospitalet, between the start of 2005 and end of 2010 were studied. Based on the D'Amico classification the sample consisted of 374 (35%) high-, 475 (44%) intermediate- and 227 (21%) low-risk patients. An index of seven adverse effects was dichotomized into zero or any number of adverse effects.  Results:   The high-risk group had significantly longer operation time, more positive surgical margins, larger prostate volume and less nerve-sparing than the contrast groups. No between-group differences were observed for reoperation, catheter time, bleeding volume or transfusions. Significantly more Clavien complications were observed in the high-risk than in the low-risk group. A positive adverse effect index score was associated with positive margins, no nerve-sparing surgery and no preoperative magnetic resonance imaging, and negatively associated with the second and third of three 2-year study periods.  Conclusions:   High-risk patients had a significantly higher risk of some operative and short-term postoperative adverse events than the control groups.

Aim:   To compare QoL and functional outcomes at least 10 years after LRP with a population-based control group matched for age and region.  Methods:   Follow-up data were obtained by mailed questionnaires from patients who responded anonymously to five international questionnaires (EQ-5D, QLQ-C30, QLQ-PR25, IPSS, and IIEF).

Herein, the role of the EMT molecules was elucidated in terms of the antimetastatic activity of 1 using DU145 cells. Anethole significantly inhibited the adhesion of DU145 cells to vitronectin-coated plates, as well as migration in a wound-healing assay and invasion using a Boyden chamber. Also, anethole suppressed the expression of MMP-9 in DU145 cells by zymography, ELISA, and RT-PCR. Consistently, the silencing of MMP-9 enhanced the activity of 1 to upregulate the expression of E-cadherin and to attenuate the expression of Vimentin in DU145 cells. Compound 1 enhanced E-cadherin, which is an epithelial marker and attenuated the expression of Vimentin, Twist, and Snail as mesenchymal molecules at the mRNA level. Consistently, anethole upregulated E-cadherin and downregulated the expression of Vimentin, Twist and PI3K, and AKT at the protein level in DU145 cells.

It is the leading cause of mortality in developed countries and is one of the three leading causes of death for adults in developing countries. Pathological examination of tissue biopsies with histological confirmation of a correct cancer diagnosis is central to cancer care. Without an accurate and specific pathologic diagnosis, effective treatment cannot be planned or delivered. In addition, there are marked geographical variations in incidence of cancer overall, and of the specific cancers seen. Much of the published literature on cancer incidence in developing countries reflects gross estimates and may not reflect reality. Performing baseline studies to understand these distributions lays the groundwork for further research in this area of cancer epidemiology. Our current study surveys and ranks cancer diagnoses by individual anatomical site at Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital (QECH) which is the largest teaching and referral hospital in Malawi. A retrospective study was conducted reviewing available pathology reports over a period of one full year from January 2010 to December 2010 for biopsies from patients suspected clinically of having cancer. There were 544 biopsies of suspected cancer, taken from 96 anatomical sites. The oesophagus was the most common biopsied site followed by breast, bladder, bone, prostate, bowel, and cervical lymph node. Malignancies were found in biopsies of the oesophagus biopsies (squamous cell carcinoma, 65.1%; adenocarcinoma, 11.6%), breast (57.5%), bladder (squamous cell carcinoma, 53.1%) and stomach (37.6%). Our study demonstrates that the yield of biopsy for clinically suspected malignancy was greater than 50% for the 11 most common sites and provides a current survey of cancer types by site present in the population reporting to our hospital.""","""['P Mtonga', 'L Masamba', 'D Milner', 'L N Shulman', 'R Nyirenda', 'K Mwafulirwa']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Malawi Med J""","""['Burden of cancer in Malawi; common types, incidence and trends: national population-based cancer registry.', 'Italian cancer figures--Report 2015: The burden of rare cancers in Italy.', 'Demographic survey of four thousand patients with 10 common cancers in North Eastern Iran over the past three decades.', 'Screening for Skin Cancer in Adults: An Updated Systematic Evidence Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.', 'Pretherapeutic evaluation of patients with upper gastrointestinal tract cancer using endoscopic and laparoscopic ultrasonography.', 'The burden of urological disease in Zomba, Malawi: A needs assessment in a sub-Saharan tertiary care center.', 'Evaluating the use of pathology in improving diagnosis in rural Malawi.', 'A review of bladder cancer in Sub-Saharan Africa: A different disease, with a distinct presentation, assessment, and treatment.', 'Esophageal cancer male to female incidence ratios in Africa: A systematic review and meta-analysis of geographic, time and age trends.', 'Characterising cancer burden and quality of care at two palliative care clinics in Malawi.']"""

Thus, record linkage with secondary databases needs to be performed via procedures that are based on encrypted identifiers. In this paper, we describe the linkage of patient data from a statutory health insurance company (AOK NordWest) and from the Disease Management Program for diabetes mellitus type 2 with the database of the cancer registry. We report the cancer incidence in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D).  Methods:   Personal identifying variables of the patient cohort were encrypted before being sent electronically to the cancer registry and submitted to a probabilistic record linkage with registry data. The study included T2D patients who were residents of the Münster, Detmold, or Arnsberg districts and who were aged 40-79 years. Only primary cancers occurring between the date of enrolment and the censoring date (31 December 2010) were included. The standardized incidence ratio (SIR) was calculated relative to the number of incident cases expected on the basis of the averaged incidence rates in the general population.  Results:   The record linkage took about 3 weeks of processing time. A total of 67,447 T2D (49.2 % men) cases were included for analyses. Incident cancer was diagnosed in 2,086 men and 1,578 women. Cohort members showed an elevated risk for cancer of the liver (SIR =1.86; 95% CI =1.47-2.31), pancreas (SIR = 1.62; 95 % CI =1.36-1.91), lung (SIR = 1.21; 95% CI 1.11-1.32), and uterus (SIR = 1.34; 95 % CI 1.08-1.65), and they were less likely to be diagnosed with prostate cancer (SIR =0.72; 95% CI = 0.65-0.79).

Methods:   UFT was administered at a daily dose of 300 mg/m(2) to 26 patients, and the response to UFT 4 weeks after its induction and its toxicity were evaluated.  Results:   A reduction in the serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) value was observed in 12 patients (46.2 %), while two cases (7.7 %) achieved more than 50 % reduction in PSA. Two patients (7.7 %) required discontinuation of UFT administration because of side effects (grade 2 exanthema in one patient and grade 2 nausea in one patient).

A number of anti-cancer mechanisms of aspirin have been proposed, including the inhibition of the cyclooxygenase enzymes, through which aspirin mediates both anti-platelet and anti-inflammatory activities. This cohort study examines associations between pre-diagnostic aspirin use (overall and by dose and dosing intensity) and mortality in men with localised prostate cancer.  Patients and methods:   Men with stage I-III prostate cancer were identified from Irish National Cancer Registry records, which have been linked to national prescribing data from the Irish General Medical Services scheme. Aspirin use in the year preceding prostate cancer diagnosis was identified from this linked prescription-claims data. Adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated for associations between aspirin use and all-cause and prostate cancer-specific mortality. Associations between prescribed dose and dosing intensity were examined. The presence of effect modification by the type of treatment received and tumour characteristics was also assessed.  Results:   Two thousand nine hundred and thirty-six men with a diagnosis of stage I-III prostate cancer (2001-2006) were identified (aspirin users, n = 1131). The median duration of patient follow-up was 5.5 years. In adjusted analyses, aspirin use was associated with a small, but non-significant, reduced risk of prostate cancer-specific mortality (HR = 0.88, 95% CI 0.67-1.15). In dose-response analyses, stronger associations with prostate cancer-specific mortality were observed in men with higher aspirin dosing intensity (HR = 0.73, 95% CI 0.51-1.05) and in men receiving >75 mg of aspirin (HR = 0.61, 95% CI 0.37-0.99). Analyses of effect modification by treatment type or tumour characteristics were non-significant.  Conclusions:   Consistent with prior studies, aspirin use was associated with a non-significant reduced risk of prostate cancer-specific mortality in men with localised prostate cancer. Men receiving higher doses of aspirin had a statistically significant reduced risk of prostate cancer-specific mortality.

Patients and methods:   Patients were planned to receive cisplatin 20 mg/m(2) and etoposide 100 mg/m(2) days 1-5, and pegfilgrastim 6 mg day 6, all repeated every 2 weeks for four cycles (three cycles for good prognosis). Bleomycin was given at 30 000 IU weekly to a total of 12 doses (9 doses for good prognosis). Primary end point was feasibility, defined as the proportion of patients able to complete the etoposide and cisplatin components of BEP and be eligible to receive a fourth cycle of BEP by day 50.  Results:   Twelve poor, 16 intermediate and 15 good prognosis (n = 43) eligible patients were enrolled. Two patients aged >40 years were ineligible and excluded from analyses. The regimen was feasible in 86%, not feasible in 7% and not assessable in 7% of patients. Most common grade 3/4 adverse events were non-neutropenic infection (16%) and febrile neutropenia (12%). Complete response (CR) to chemotherapy and surgery was achieved in 33% poor-prognosis, 81% intermediate-prognosis and 100% good-prognosis patients. At median follow-up of 27 months (range 6-42), the 2-year progression-free survival was 50% for poor-prognosis, 94% for intermediate-prognosis and 92% for good-prognosis patients.

The Hippo tumour suppressor pathway is inactivated in many types of cancers, leading to tumour progression and metastasis. However, the mechanisms of pathway inactivation in tumours remain unclear. Here we demonstrate that integrin-linked kinase (ILK) plays a critical role in the suppression of the Hippo pathway via phospho-inhibition of MYPT1-PP1, leading to inactivation of Merlin. Inhibition of ILK in breast, prostate and colon tumour cells results in the activation of the Hippo pathway components MST1 and LATS1 with concomitant inactivation of YAP/TAZ (Yes-associated protein/transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif) transcriptional co-activators and TEAD-mediated transcription. Genetic deletion of ILK suppresses ErbB2-driven YAP/TAZ activation in mammary tumours, and its pharmacological inhibition suppresses YAP activation and tumour growth in vivo. Our data demonstrate a role for ILK as a multiple receptor proximal regulator of Hippo tumour suppressor pathway and as a cancer therapeutic target.""","""['Isabel Serrano', 'Paul C McDonald', 'Frances Lock', 'William J Muller', 'Shoukat Dedhar']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Nat Commun""","""['MAP4K family kinases act in parallel to MST1/2 to activate LATS1/2 in the Hippo pathway.', 'KIBRA exhibits MST-independent functional regulation of the Hippo signaling pathway in mammals.', 'Statin suppresses Hippo pathway-inactivated malignant mesothelioma cells and blocks the YAP/CD44 growth stimulatory axis.', 'DNA binding partners of YAP/TAZ.', 'Reciprocal regulation of YAP/TAZ by the Hippo pathway and the Small GTPase pathway.', 'Upregulation of integrin‑linked kinase enhances tumor progression in gemcitabine‑resistant pancreatic cancer.', 'The Hippo Pathway Effectors YAP/TAZ-TEAD Oncoproteins as Emerging Therapeutic Targets in the Tumor Microenvironment.', 'Insights into recent findings and clinical application of YAP and TAZ in cancer.', 'Association of Glycosylation-Related Genes with Different Patterns of Immune Profiles and Prognosis in Cervical Cancer.', 'The oncogenic roles and clinical implications of YAP/TAZ in breast cancer.']"""

Xenografts preserved the histopathology, genome architecture, and global gene expression of donor tumors. Moreover, their aggressiveness matched patient observations, and their response to androgen withdrawal correlated with tumor subtype. The panel includes the first xenografts generated from needle biopsy tissue obtained at diagnosis. This advance was exploited to generate independent xenografts from different sites of a primary site, enabling functional dissection of tumor heterogeneity. Prolonged exposure of adenocarcinoma xenografts to androgen withdrawal led to castration-resistant prostate cancer, including the first-in-field model of complete transdifferentiation into lethal neuroendocrine prostate cancer. Further analysis of this model supports the hypothesis that neuroendocrine prostate cancer can evolve directly from adenocarcinoma via an adaptive response and yielded a set of genes potentially involved in neuroendocrine transdifferentiation.

This study presents our experiences with the treatment.  Material and methods:   sCAP procedures were performed from 2006 to 2012. Cases were registered prospectively. Recurrent disease was defined by the Phoenix criterion (prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level > PSA nadir + 2 ng/ml).  Results:   A total of 39 sCAP treatments were performed in 37 patients. Four patients had previously been treated with brachytherapy and 33 with external radiation. There were two cases of hemiablations; the remaining cases were total ablations. The median follow-up period was 42 (0-69) months and the age at the time of treatment was 66 (53-78) years. Stratified according to D'Amico et al's 2003 risk definition, five patients had pre-RT intermediate-risk disease, and 31 had high-risk disease. Three cases could not be classified. Biochemical recurrence was found in 27 cases, and the 12-month disease-free survival was 18.2% overall. No patient in the intermediate group had recurrence. In high-risk patients, there were 25 cases of recurrence and the 12-month disease-free survival was 10.7%. There were five (13%) cases of fistula formation and seven (19%) cases of severe post-operative incontinence, all in previous high-risk patients. Information on potency was deficient.  Conclusion:   In this limited study, sCAP was very infrequently a curable treatment in high-risk patients, and the treatment carried a high risk of severe morbidity. It seems, however, that sCAP could be beneficial to patients, primarily in the intermediate-risk group.

Background:   Various treatments of differing qualities can be used for patients with localised prostate cancer; these treatments may cause conflicts in treatment decision-making and post-treatment regret.  Design:   A quantitative longitudinal study.  Methods:   A total of 48 patients were recruited from a 3700-bed medical centre in northern Taiwan and assessed at pretreatment and one and six months post-treatment. Demographic characteristics, clinical information and results from the psychosocial adjustment to illness scale, decisional conflict scale and decision regret scale were collected. Data were analysed based on the generalised estimating equations models.  Results:   The overall decisional conflict substantially improved over time. However, the feeling of being less informed was high and did not improve considerably during the study period. Education level, decision preferences and psychosocial adjustment were associated with decisional conflict and influenced decision-making. The feeling of ineffective decision-making and decisional regret was low, post-treatment. Psychosocial adjustment was associated with effective decision-making and decisional regret.  Conclusion:   In patients with localised prostate cancer, decisional conflict reduced considerably up to six months post-treatment. Moreover, the patients were satisfied with their treatment decision-making and believed that they had made the correct choice up to six months post-treatment. However, patients may have experienced feelings of being less informed pre- and post-treatment, particularly those with lower education levels, a preference for passive roles, or inferior psychosocial adjustment. Consequently, health professionals must provide adequate medical information and psychosocial intervention to help patients in the decision-making process.  Relevance to clinical practice:   Nurses and healthcare providers must provide localised prostate cancer patients with adequate information and psychosocial intervention to reduce decisional conflict.""","""['Ching-Hui Chien', 'Cheng-Keng Chuang', 'Kuan-Lin Liu', 'Chia-Lin Li', 'Hsueh-Erh Liu']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Clin Nurs""","""['A longitudinal study investigating the role of decisional conflicts and regret and short-term psychological adjustment after IVF treatment failure.', 'Perception of cancer and inconsistency in medical information are associated with decisional conflict: a pilot study of men with prostate cancer who undergo active surveillance.', 'Spirituality is associated with less treatment regret in men with localized prostate cancer.', 'Decision Aids for Cancer Screening and Treatment Internet.', 'Examining the effectiveness and implementation of patient treatment decision-aid tools for men with localised prostate cancer: A systematic review.', 'Encouraging Patients to Ask Questions: Development and Pilot Testing of a Question Prompt List for Patients Undergoing a Biopsy for Suspected Prostate Cancer.', 'Decisional Conflict is Associated with Treatment Modality and not Disease Knowledge in South African Men with Prostate Cancer: Baseline Results from a Longitudinal Prospective Observational Study.', 'Factors Affecting Satisfaction with the Decision-Making Process and Decision Regret for Men with a New Diagnosis of Prostate Cancer.', 'Patient factors affecting decision regret in the medical treatment process of gynecological diseases.', 'Treatment-related Decisional Conflict, Quality of Life, and Comorbidity in Older Adults with Cancer.']"""

Life expectancy is surprisingly good, particularly for patients over 60ys. We hypothesised that individuals with HHT may be protected against life-limiting cancers.  Methods:   To compare specific cancer rates in HHT patients and controls, we developed a questionnaire capturing data on multiple relatives per respondent, powered to detect differences in the four most common solid non skin cancers (breast, colorectal, lung and prostate), each associated with significant mortality. Blinded to cancer responses, reports of HHT-specific features allowed assignment of participants and relatives as HHT-subjects, unknowns, or controls. Logistic and quadratic regressions were used to compare rates of specific cancer types between HHT subjects and controls.  Results:   1,307 participants completed the questionnaire including 1,007 HHT-subjects and 142 controls. The rigorous HHT diagnostic algorithm meant that 158 (12%) completed datasets were not assignable either to HHT or control status. For cancers predominantly recognised as primary cancers, the rates in the controls generally matched age-standardised rates for the general population. HHT subjects recruited through the survey had similar demographics to controls, although the HHT group reported a significantly greater smoking habit. Combining data of participants and uniquely-reported relatives resulted in an HHT-arm of 2,161 (58% female), and control-arm of 2,817 (52% female), with median ages of 66ys [IQR 53-77] and 77ys [IQR 65-82] respectively. In both crude and age-adjusted regression, lung cancers were significantly less frequent in the HHT arm than controls (age-adjusted odds ratio 0.48 [0.30, 0.70], p = 0.0012). Breast cancer prevalence was higher in HHT than controls (age-adjusted OR 1.52 [1.07, 2.14], p = 0.018). Overall, prostate and colorectal cancer rates were equivalent, but the pattern of colorectal cancer was modified, with a higher prevalence in younger HHT patients than controls.  Conclusions:   These preliminary survey data suggest clinically significant differences in the rates of lung, breast and colorectal cancer in HHT patients compared to controls. For rare diseases in which longitudinal studies take decades to recruit equivalent datasets, this type of methodology provides a good first-step method for data collection.""","""['Anna E Hosman', 'Hannah L Devlin', 'B Maneesha Silva', 'Claire L Shovlin']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Orphanet J Rare Dis""","""['Cancer and hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia.', 'Cancer incidence in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia.', 'Pulmonary Arteriovenous Malformations Are Associated with Silent Brain Infarcts in Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia Patients.', 'Systematic screening in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia: a review.', 'Pulmonary vascular manifestations of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (rendu-osler disease).', 'Partial hepatectomy for a patient with Rendu-Osler-Weber disease: a case report.', 'SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia Patients Suggests Less Clinical Impact Than in the General Population.', 'Hot and Cold Tumors: Is Endoglin (CD105) a Potential Target for Vessel Normalization?', 'Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT) and Survival: The Importance of Systematic Screening and Treatment in HHT Centers of Excellence.', 'Pathologically Complete Response after Triple Therapy in Locally Advanced Esophageal Cancer in a Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia Patient.']"""

Using a novel method of target identification, we demonstrate that AR is a direct target of PP in prostate cancer cells. We demonstrate that PP inhibits AR activity via the highly conserved DNA binding domain (DBD), the only AR inhibitor that functions via this domain. Furthermore, computational modeling predicts that pyrvinium binds at the interface of the DBD dimer and the minor groove of the AR response element. Because PP acts through the DBD, PP is able to inhibit the constitutive activity of AR splice variants, which are thought to contribute to the growth of castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). PP also inhibits androgen-independent AR activation by HER2 kinase. The antiandrogen activity of pyrvinium manifests in the ability to inhibit the in vivo growth of CRPC xenografts that express AR splice variants. Interestingly, PP was most potent in cells with endogenous AR expression derived from prostate or bone. PP was able to inhibit several other hormone nuclear receptors (NRs) but not structurally unrelated transcription factors. PP inhibition of other NRs was similarly cell-type selective. Using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, we demonstrate that the cell-type specificity of PP manifests in tissue-selective inhibition of AR activity in mice, as PP decreases prostate weight and bone mineral density but does not affect lean body mass. Our results suggest that the noncompetitive AR inhibitor pyrvinium has significant potential to treat CRPC, including cancers driven by ligand-independent AR signaling.""","""['Minyoung Lim', 'Maya Otto-Duessel', 'Miaoling He', 'Leila Su', 'Dan Nguyen', 'Emily Chin', 'Tamara Alliston', 'Jeremy O Jones']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""ACS Chem Biol""","""['Discovery of small-molecule inhibitors selectively targeting the DNA-binding domain of the human androgen receptor.', 'In silico discovery of androgen receptor antagonists with activity in castration resistant prostate cancer.', 'Moving Towards Precision Urologic Oncology: Targeting Enzalutamide-resistant Prostate Cancer and Mutated Forms of the Androgen Receptor Using the Novel Inhibitor Darolutamide (ODM-201).', 'Androgen receptor-dependent and -independent mechanisms driving prostate cancer progression: Opportunities for therapeutic targeting from multiple angles.', 'An Overview of Next-Generation Androgen Receptor-Targeted Therapeutics in Development for the Treatment of Prostate Cancer.', 'Pyrvinium Pamoate: Past, Present, and Future as an Anti-Cancer Drug.', 'Constitutively Active Androgen Receptor in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.', 'AR Structural Variants and Prostate Cancer.', 'A Novel Dialkylamino-Functionalized Chalcone, DML6, Inhibits Cervical Cancer Cell Proliferation, In Vitro, via Induction of Oxidative Stress, Intrinsic Apoptosis and Mitotic Catastrophe.', 'Discovery of novel antagonists targeting the DNA binding domain of androgen receptor by integrated docking-based virtual screening and bioassays.']"""

Here, we describe molecular scale antisense oligonucleotide conjugates that bind selectively to a cell surface receptor, are internalized, and then partially escape from nonproductive endosomal locations to reach their sites of action in the nucleus. Peptides that include bombesin sequences for receptor targeting and a run of histidine residues for endosomal disruption were covalently linked to a splice switching antisense oligonucleotide.

In this study we investigated the effects of diets with different protein content or quality on prostate and breast cancer.  Experimental design:   To test our hypothesis we assessed the inhibitory effect of protein diet restriction on prostate and breast cancer growth, serum PSA and IGF-1 concentrations, mTOR activity and epigenetic markers, by using human xenograft cancer models.  Results:   Our results showed a 70% inhibition of tumor growth in the castrate-resistant LuCaP23.1 prostate cancer model and a 56% inhibition in the WHIM16 breast cancer model fed with a 7% protein diet when compared to an isocaloric 21% protein diet. Inhibition of tumor growth correlated, in the LuCaP23.1 model, with decreased serum PSA and IGF-1 levels, down-regulation of mTORC1 activity, decreased cell proliferation as indicated by Ki67 staining, and reduction in epigenetic markers of prostate cancer progression, including the histone methyltransferase EZH2 and the associated histone mark H3K27me3. In addition, we observed that modifications of dietary protein quality, independently of protein quantity, decreased tumor growth. A diet containing 20% plant protein inhibited tumor weight by 37% as compared to a 20% animal dairy protein diet.

Methods:   Twenty patients underwent PET/CT 1 h after injection of the (68)Ga-PSMA ligand followed by PET/MRI 3 h after injection. Data from the two investigations were first analysed separately and then compared with respect to tumour detection rate and radiotracer uptake in various tissues. To evaluate the quantification accuracy of the PET/MRI system, differences in SUVs between PET/CT and corresponding PET/MRI were compared with differences in SUVs between PET/CT 1 h and 3 h after injection in another patient cohort. This cohort was investigated using the same PET/CT system.  Results:   With PET/MRI, different diagnostic sequences, higher contrast of lesions and higher resolution of MRI enabled a subjectively easier evaluation of the images. In addition, four unclear findings on PET/CT could be clarified as characteristic of PCa metastases by PET/MRI. However, in PET images of the PET/MRI, a reduced signal was observed at the level of the kidneys (in 11 patients) and around the urinary bladder (in 15 patients). This led to reduced SUVs in six lesions. SUVmean values provided by the PET/MRI system were different in muscles, blood pool, liver and spleen.  Conclusion:   PCa was detected more easily and more accurately with Ga-PSMA PET/MRI than with PET/CT and with lower radiation exposure. Consequently, this new technique could clarify unclear findings on PET/CT. However, scatter correction was challenging when the specific (68)Ga-PSMA ligand was used.

We previously showed that the transcription factor Twist1, which promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition, was involved in castration-resistant progression. Similarly, protein kinase C (PKC) has been implicated in both metastatic progression and castration resistance in prostate cancer.  Experimental design:   In this study, we aimed to elucidate the role of PKC/Twist1 signaling in castration resistance, and to apply this information to the development of a novel therapeutic concept using PKC inhibitor Ro31-8220 against prostate cancer using various prostate cancer cell lines.  Results:   Androgen deprivation and the next-generation antiandrogen enzalutamide induced PKC activation and Twist1 expression, which were reversed by the PKC inhibitor Ro31-8220. Ro31-8220 suppressed cell proliferation in androgen-dependent prostate cancer LNCaP cells, which was augmented by its combination with androgen deprivation or enzalutamide. The favorable anticancer effects of the combination of Ro31-8220 and enzalutamide were also observed in castration-resistant C4-2 and 22Rv1 cells. Furthermore, PKC phosphorylation was elevated in castration-resistant and enzalutamide-resistant cells compared with their parental cells, leading to persistent sensitivity to Ro-31-8220 in castration- and enzalutamide-resistant cells.  Conclusions:   Taken together, these findings indicate that PKC/Twist1 signaling contributes to castration resistance as well as enzalutamide resistance in prostate cancer, and suggest that therapeutics targeting PKC/Twist1 signaling, such as PKC inhibitors, represent a promising novel therapeutic strategy for prostate cancer, especially castration-resistant prostate cancer, when combined with enzalutamide.""","""['Masaki Shiota', 'Akira Yokomizo', 'Ario Takeuchi', 'Kenjiro Imada', 'Eiji Kashiwagi', 'YooHyun Song', 'Junichi Inokuchi', 'Katsunori Tatsugami', 'Takeshi Uchiumi', 'Seiji Naito']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Clin Cancer Res""","""['Protein kinase C regulates Twist1 expression via NF-κB in prostate cancer.', 'Inhibition of RSK/YB-1 signaling enhances the anti-cancer effect of enzalutamide in prostate cancer.', 'Targeting CPT1B as a potential therapeutic strategy in castration-resistant and enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer.', 'The evolving role of enzalutamide on the treatment of prostate cancer.', 'Mechanisms of enzalutamide resistance in castration-resistant prostate cancer and therapeutic strategies to overcome it.', 'The Neuropilin-1/PKC axis promotes neuroendocrine differentiation and drug resistance of prostate cancer.', 'Phenotypic Plasticity - Alternate Transcriptional Programs Driving Treatment Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Overcoming the mechanisms of primary and acquired resistance to new generation hormonal therapies in advanced prostate cancer: focus on androgen receptor independent pathways.', 'Resistance to second generation antiandrogens in prostate cancer: pathways and mechanisms.', 'An oral first-in-class small molecule RSK inhibitor suppresses AR variants and tumor growth in prostate cancer.']"""

Association with relapse during 5 years of follow-up was examined in exploratory analyses of the potential clinical relevance of the genetic alterations.  Results:   Of the 40 tumors evaluable for mutations, 10% had point mutations in potentially actionable cancer genes.

We explored the spatial incidence patterns of common cancers in Saudi Arabia using spatial autocorrelation analyses, employing the global Moran's I and Anselin's local Moran's I statistics to detect nonrandom incidence patterns. Global ordinary least squares (OLS) regression and local geographically-weighted regression (GWR) were applied to examine the spatial correlation of cancer incidences at the city level. Population-based records of cancers diagnosed between 1998 and 2004 were used. Male lung cancer and female breast cancer exhibited positive statistically significant global Moran's I index values, indicating a tendency toward clustering. The Anselin's local Moran's I analyses revealed small significant clusters of lung cancer, prostate cancer and Hodgkin's disease among males in the Eastern region and significant clusters of thyroid cancers in females in the Eastern and Riyadh regions. Additionally, both regression methods found significant associations among various cancers. For example, OLS and GWR revealed significant spatial associations among NHL, leukemia and Hodgkin's disease (r² = 0.49-0.67 using OLS and r² = 0.52-0.68 using GWR) and between breast and prostate cancer (r² = 0.53 OLS and 0.57 GWR) in Saudi Arabian cities. These findings may help to generate etiologic hypotheses of cancer causation and identify spatial anomalies in cancer incidence in Saudi Arabia.

In this study, an analysis of patients receiving the trimodality therapy was performed to identify prognostic factors of biochemical relapse-free survival (bRFS). Between May 2005 and November 2008, 123 high-risk prostate cancer patients (D'Amico classification) were treated with NHT prior to HDR brachytherapy combined with hypofractionated EBRT. Among these patients, 121 had completed AHT. The patients were assigned by time to be treated with a low-dose or high-dose arm of HDR brachytherapy with subsequent hypofractionated 3D conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT). Multivariate analysis was used to determine prognostic factors for bRFS. With a median follow-up of 60 months, the 5-year bRFS for all patients was 84.3% (high-dose arm, 92.9%; low-dose arm, 72.4%, P = 0.047). bRFS in the pre-HDR PSA ≤ 0.1 ng/ml subgroup was significantly improved compared with that in the pre-HDR PSA > 0.1 ng/ml subgroup (88.3% vs 68.2%, P = 0.034). On multivariate analysis, dose of HDR (P = 0.045, HR = 0.25, 95% CI = 0.038-0.97) and pre-HDR PSA level (P = 0.02 HR = 3.2, 95% CI = 1.18-10.16) were significant prognostic factors predicting bRFS. In high-risk prostate cancer patients treated with the trimodality therapy, the dose of HDR and pre-HDR PSA were significant prognostic factors.

Methods and materials:   We evaluated 390 patients with pT3N0 prostate cancer (PCa) receiving RP and aRT at 6 European centers between 1993 and 2006. Patients who were free from BCR at <2 years' follow-up were excluded. This resulted in 374 assessable patients. Early BCR was defined as 2 consecutive prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test values >0.2 ng/mL within 2 or 3 years after aRT. Uni- and multivariable Cox regression analyses predicting overall and eBCR after aRT were fitted. Covariates consisted of preoperative PSA results, surgical margins, pathological stage, Gleason score, and aRT dose.  Results:   Overall, 5- and 8-year BCR-free survival rates were 77.1% and 70.8%, respectively. At a median follow-up of 86 months after aRT, 33 (8.8%) and 55 (14.6%) men experienced BCR within 2 or 3 years after aRT, respectively. In multivariable analyses, Gleason scores of 8 to 10 represented the only independent predictor of eBCR after aRT (all, P≤.01). The risk of BCR was significantly higher in patients with a Gleason score of 8 to 10 disease than in those with Gleason 2 to 6 within 24 months after treatment, after adjusting for all covariates (all, P≤.04). However, given a 24-month BCR free period, the risk of subsequent BCR for men with poorly differentiated disease was equal to that of men with less aggressive disease (all, P≥.3).  Conclusions:   High Gleason score represents the only predictor of eBCR after RP and aRT in patients affected by pT3N0 PCa.

Methods and materials:   Localization errors were recorded for patients receiving SBRT for 141 lung, 29 liver, 48 prostate, and 45 spine tumors representing 1005 total localization sessions. All patients were treated in a stereotactic body frame with a large custom-molded vacuum pillow. Patients were first localized to the frame using tattoos placed during simulation. Subsequently, the frame was aligned to the room lasers according to the stereotactic coordinates determined from the treatment plan. Every patient received a pretreatment and an intrafraction CBCT. Abdominal compression was used for all liver patients and for approximately 40% of the lung patients to reduce tumor motion due to respiration.  Results:   The mean ± standard deviation pretreatment setup errors from all localizations were -2.44 ± 3.85, 1.31 ± 5.84, and 0.11 ± 3.76 mm in the anteroposterior, superoinferior, and lateral directions, respectively.

In Spain the incidence of PCa was 70.75 cases per 100,000 males. Advanced PCa has spread outside of the prostate capsule and may involve other parts of the body. The aim of this study was to estimate the lifetime costs of a cohort of advanced PCa patients diagnosed in Spain in 2012.  Methods:   A partitioned economic model was developed in EXCEL incorporating Spanish incidence, mortality, and cost data supplemented with data from the international literature. Progression from Stage III to Stage IV was permitted. Costs were discounted at the standard rate of 3%. Lifetime costs were presented on an individual basis and for the entire cohort of newly diagnosed Stage III and Stage IV PCa patients.  Results:   Lifetime costs for advanced PCa were ∼€19,961 per patient (mean survival of 8.4 years). Using the projected incident cases for 2012 (3047), the total cost for the incident cohort of patients in 2012 would amount to €61 million. These results were more sensitive to changes in the ongoing costs (post-initial 12 months) of Stage III PCa, the rate of progression from Stage III to Stage IV, and the discount rate applied to costs.  Conclusions:   This study provides an estimate of the lifetime costs of advanced PCa in Spain and a framework for further research. The study is limited by the availability of long-term Spanish data and the need to make inferences from international studies. However, until long-term prospective or observational data do become available in Spain, based on the assumptions, the current results indicate that the burden of advanced PCa in Spain is substantial.

Materials and methods:   The patient population of study was from the Premier Perspective Database (Premier, Inc., Charlotte, NC) and consisted of 71,312 radical prostatectomies performed at more than 300 U.S. hospitals by up to 3739 surgeons by open or robotic techniques from 2004 to 2010. The key endpoints were surgery time, inpatient length of stay, and overall complications. We compared open versus robotic, results by year of procedures, results by case volume of specific surgeons, and results of open surgery in hospitals with and without a robotic system.  Results:   The mean surgery time was longer for RARP (4.4 hours, standard deviation [SD] 1.7) compared with ORP (3.4 hours, SD 1.5) in the same hospitals (p<0.0001). Inpatient stay was shorter for RARP (2.2 days, SD 1.9) compared with ORP (3.2 days, SD 2.7) in the same hospitals (p<0.0001). The overall complications were less for RARP (10.6%) compared with ORP (15.8%) in the same hospitals, as were transfusion rates. ORP results in hospitals without a robot were not better than ORP with a robot, and pretreatment co-morbidity profiles were similar in all cohorts. Trending of results by year of procedure showed no differences in the three cohorts, but trending of RARP results by surgeon experience showed improvements in surgery time, hospital stay, conversion rates, and complication rates.  Conclusions:   During the initial 7 years of RARP development, outcomes showed decreased hospital stay, complications, and transfusion rates.

However, its role in human prostate cancer (PCa) is still unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate miR-126 expression in PCa and its prognostic value for PCa patients undergoing radical prostatectomy.  Methods:   A series of 128 cases with PCa were evaluated for the expression levels of miR-126 by quantitative reverse-transcription PCR (qRT-PCR). Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to investigate the correlation between miR-126 expression and prognosis of PCa patients.  Results:   Compared with non-cancerous prostate tissues, the expression level of miR-126 was significantly decreased in PCa tissues (PCa vs. non-cancerous prostate: 1.05 ± 0.63 vs. 2.92 ± 0.98, P < 0.001). Additionally, the loss of miR-126 expression was dramatically associated with aggressive clinical pathological features, including advanced pathological stage (P = 0.001), positive lymph node metastasis (P = 0.006), high preoperative PSA (P = 0.003) and positive angiolymphatic invasion (P = 0.001). Moreover, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that PCa patients with low miR-126 expression have shorter biochemical recurrence (BCR)-free survival than those with high miR-126 expression. Furthermore, multivariate analysis indicated that miR-126 expression was an independent prognostic factor for BCR-free survival after radical prostatectomy.  Conclusion:   These findings suggest for the first time that the loss of miR-126 expression may play a positive role in the malignant progression of PCa.

To image exposed PS, we used a fully human PS-targeting antibody fragment, PGN635 F(ab')2, that binds to complexes of PS and β2-glycoprotein I. PGN635 F(ab')2 was labeled with the positron-emitting isotope iodine-124 ((124)I) and the resulting probe was injected into nude mice bearing subcutaneous or orthotopic human PC3 prostate tumors. Biodistribution studies showed that (124)I-PGN635 F(ab')2 localized with remarkable specificity to the tumors with little uptake in other organs, including the liver and kidneys. Clear delineation of the tumors was achieved by PET 48 hours after injection. Radiation of the tumors with 15 Gy or systemic treatment of the mice with 10 mg/kg docetaxel increased localization in the tumors.

Hence, it is worth studying the anti-tumor effect of NCTD on human prostate cancer cells DU145. It was found that after the treatment of NCTD with different concentrations (25-100 μM), the cell proliferation was significantly inhibited, which led to the appearance of micronucleus (MN). Moreover, the cells could be killed in a dose-/time-dependent manner along with the reduction of PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear antigen) expression, destruction of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), down-regulation of MnSOD, induction of ROS, depletion of ATP, and activation of AMPK (Adenosine 5'-monophosphate -activated protein kinase) . In addition, a remarkable release of cytochrome c was found in the cells exposed to 100 μM NCTD and exogenous SOD-PEG could eliminate the generation of NCTD-induced MN.

Next, we evaluated MFE for microsomal stability and anti-cancer activity in nude mice. MFE induced apoptosis, decreased viability and proliferation in prostate cancer cells. MFE increased the expression of ER stress proteins. Interestingly, MFE selectively promotes ER stress in prostate cancer cells while sparing PrECs.

In this study, we investigate an alternative mechanism through which inflammation promotes the initiation of prostate cancer. Adult murine prostate epithelia are composed predominantly of basal and luminal cells. Previous studies revealed that the two lineages are largely self-sustained when residing in their native microenvironment. To interrogate whether tissue inflammation alters the differentiation program of basal cells, we conducted lineage tracing of basal cells using a K14-CreER;mTmG model in concert with a murine model of prostatitis induced by infection from the uropathogenic bacteria CP9. We show that acute prostatitis causes tissue damage and creates a tissue microenvironment that induces the differentiation of basal cells into luminal cells, an alteration that rarely occurs under normal physiological conditions. Previously we showed that a mouse model with prostate basal cell-specific deletion of Phosphatase and tensin homolog (K14-CreER;Pten(fl/fl)) develops prostate cancer with a long latency, because disease initiation in this model requires and is limited by the differentiation of transformation-resistant basal cells into transformation-competent luminal cells. Here, we show that CP9-induced prostatitis significantly accelerates the initiation of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia in this model.

Results:   We analyzed 2,761 patients for changes in pain severity. At initial assessment, 53.0% had no pain, 23.5% had mild pain, 10.3% had moderate pain, and 13.2% had severe pain. Overall, one third of patients with initial pain had pain reduction within 1 month of follow-up, and one fifth had an increase, and the improvement and worsening of pain varied by baseline pain score. Of the patients without pain at initial assessment, 28.4% had pain (8.9% moderate to severe) at the follow-up assessment. Logistic regression analysis showed that inadequate pain management was significantly associated with pain deterioration, as were lower baseline pain level, younger age, and poor health status.

However, the role of O-GlcNAc in prostate cancer progression of patients remains poorly unknown. Here we investigated the clinicopathological significance of O-GlcNAc expression level in prostate cancer.  Methods:   O-GlcNAc expression level in prostate cancer cells was determined by immunohistochemistry of prostate biopsy specimens obtained from 56 patients later treated with hormone deprivation therapy comparing with adjacent normal prostate glands in the same sections. Overall survival was determined by the Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards methods with univariate and multivariate models. The effects of reduced O-GlcNAc expression level on proliferation and invasion of prostate cancer LNCaP cells were examined using small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT), the enzyme responsible for O-GlcNAc biosynthesis.  Results:   Defining cancer cells showing stronger cytoplasmic staining than normal prostate glands as overexpression of O-GlcNAc, 39% of prostate cancer patients were categorized as overexpression. The Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards methods with univariate model analysis revealed that O-GlcNAc overexpression was associated with overall survival (P=0.0012 for the Kaplan-Meier and P=0.0021 for Cox univariate hazard model analysis). Furthermore, O-GlcNAc was the only item in which a significant difference was observed at overall survival by multivariate analysis (P=0.0475). Finally, siRNA-mediated OGT knockdown in LNCaP cells resulted in decreased expression of O-GlcNAc and promoted decreased proliferation and tumor cell invasion compared with control siRNA-transfected LNCaP cells.

This study compared robot-assisted total mesorectal excision (RTME) and laparoscopic total mesorectal excision (LTME) with regard to these functional outcomes.  Methods:   A series of 32 men who underwent RTME between February 1, 2009 and December 31, 2010 were matched 1:1 with patients who underwent LTME. The matching criteria were age, body mass index, tumor distance from the anal verge, neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy, and tumor stage. Urinary and erectile function were evaluated using the International Prostatic Symptom Score (IPSS) and the five-item version of the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5) scale. Data were collected from the two groups at baseline and at 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery and compared.  Results:   The mean IPSS score did not differ between the two groups at baseline at any point of measurement. The mean baseline IIEF-5 score was similar between the two groups and was decreased at 3 months. The mean IIEF-5 score was significantly higher in the RTME group at 6 months than in the LTME group (14.1 ± 6.1 vs. 9.4 ± 6.6; p = 0.024). The interval decrease in IIEF-5 scores was significantly higher in the LTME group than in the RTME group at 6 months (4.9 ± 4.5 vs. 9.2 ± 4.7; p = 0.030).

There are no limitations to the realization of this exam but androgen deprivation treatment should not be initiated or modified before performing TEP-choline. Some studies have shown a good correlation between choline uptake within the prostate and the tumor, if the size is greater than 5 mm; this exam is interesting in case of negative biopsy. In the initial staging of high-risk prostate cancer, metastatic nodes could be detected if there are more than 5 mm, especially those localized outside the lymphadenectomy area. TEP-choline is the most efficient exam that could detect intra-medullary bone metastases. It could realize the staging N and M in one procedure, and it could replace conventional imaging exams to detect lesions at an early stage. In the evaluation of recurrent disease, TEP-choline is able to detect the site of relapse--local, pelvic nodal or bone metastases--from a threshold of 1 ng/mL, less if the velocity value is greater than 1 ng/mL per year or the doubling time less than 6 months. For low PSA value, (around 5 ng/mL), relapse is usually isolated, either be local or nodal or metastatic. TEP-choline could be carried out in a first intention to consider a local salvage treatment. Bladder accumulation of choline can hide local small volume recurrence: overcome this drawback by the administration of Furosemide.

A test statistic Tmax was proposed that summarizes the differences between the images into a single value and a permutation procedure was employed to compute the adjusted p-value. We demonstrated the method in two retrospective studies: a prostate study that relates 3D dose distributions to failure, and an esophagus study that relates 2D surface dose distributions of the esophagus to acute esophagus toxicity.

Methods:   A total of 1,874 post-radical-prostatectomy (RP) patients of pT2-T3a between 2000 and 2010 at three tertiary centers, and who did not receive neoadjuvant/adjuvant therapy, were included in this study. Patients were stratified according to BCR risk: low risk (PSA <10, pT2a-b, and pGS ≤6), intermediate risk (PSA 10-20 and/or pT2c and/or pGS 7), and high risk (PSA >20 or pT3a or pGS 8-10). The median follow-up was 43 months.  Results:   PSMs were a significant predictor of BCR in both the intermediate- and high-risk-disease groups (P = .001, HR 2.1, 95 % CI 1.3-3.4; P < .001, HR 2.8, 95 % CI 2.0-4.1).

Psychological factors have been negatively associated with preventive health behaviors such as cancer screenings. The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of depressive and trauma-related symptoms on prostate cancer screening behaviors and relevant health care perceptions among a sample of U.S. military veterans, as veterans are at higher risk for prostate cancer, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder than the general population.

Results indicate that greater depressive symptoms, trauma-related symptoms, and perceived barriers were associated with lower rates of past prostate cancer screening among this veteran sample and that greater depressive and trauma-related symptoms were associated with greater perceived barriers to prostate cancer screening. As prostate cancer screening recommendations continue to evolve, it is important for health care providers not only to discuss pros and cons of screening with high risk men but also to consider the impact of psychological distress on the decision-making process.""","""['Amy K Silberbogen', 'Andrea K Busby', 'Erin W Ulloa']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Am J Mens Health""","""['Associations between perceived social reactions to trauma-related experiences with PTSD and depression among veterans seeking PTSD treatment.', 'Psychological resilience in U.S. military veterans: A 2-year, nationally representative prospective cohort study.', 'Impact of emotional approach coping and hope on PTSD and depression symptoms in a trauma exposed sample of Veterans receiving outpatient VA mental health care services.', 'Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Symptom Severity and Socioeconomic Factors Associated with Veterans Health Administration Use among Women Veterans.', 'The Gulf War Syndrome twenty years on.', 'Pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments for major depressive disorder: review of systematic reviews.', 'The Impact of Preexisting Mental Health Disorders on the Diagnosis, Treatment, and Survival among Lung Cancer Patients in the U.S. Military Health System.', 'Baseline Attitudes About Prostate Cancer Screening Moderate the Impact of Decision Aids on Screening Rates.']"""

It is downregulated in most normal cells, except in lipogenic tissues such as liver, lactating breast, fetal lung, and adipose tissue. Conversely, several human cancers, including head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC), overexpress FASN, which has been associated with poor prognosis and recently suggested as a metabolic oncoprotein. Orlistat is an irreversible inhibitor of FASN activity with cytotoxic properties on several cancer cell lines that inhibits tumor progression and metastasis in prostate cancer xenografts and experimental melanomas, respectively. To explore whether the inhibition of FASN could impact oral tongue squamous cell carcinoma (OTSCC) metastatic spread, an orthotopic model was developed by the implantation of SCC-9 ZsGreen LN-1 cells into the tongue of BALB/c nude mice. These cells were isolated through in vivo selection, show a more invasive behavior in vitro than the parental cells, and generate orthotopic tumors that spontaneously metastasize to cervical lymph nodes in 10 to 15 days only. SCC-9 ZsGreen LN-1 cells also exhibit enhanced production of MMP-2, ERBB2, and CDH2.

Objective:   To externally validate a previously developed Prostate Health Index (PHI)-based nomogram for predicting the presence of prostate cancer (PCa) at biopsy.  Design, setting, and participants:   The study population consisted of 883 patients who were scheduled for a prostate biopsy at one of five European tertiary care centers. Total prostate-specific antigen (tPSA), free prostate-specific antigen (fPSA), and [-2]pro-prostate-specific antigen (p2PSA) levels were determined. The fPSA-to-tPSA ratio (%fPSA), p2PSA, and PHI ([p2PSA / fPSA] × √tPSA) were calculated.  Intervention:   Extended initial and repeat prostate biopsy.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Logistic regression models were fitted to test the predictors of PCa and to determine their predictive accuracy. A calibration plot was used to evaluate the extent of overestimation or underestimation between nomogram predictions and observed PCa rate. Decision curve analysis (DCA) provided an estimate of the net benefit obtained by using the PHI-based nomogram.  Results and limitations:   Of 833 patients, 365 (41.3%) were diagnosed with PCa at extended prostate biopsy. In accuracy analyses, PHI was the most informative predictor of PCa (0.68), outperforming tPSA (0.51) and %fPSA (0.64). The predictive accuracy of the previously developed nomogram was 75.2% (95% confidence interval, 71.4-78.1). Calibration of the nomogram was good in patients at a low to intermediate predicted probability of PCa, while calibration was suboptimal, with a tendency to overestimate the presence of PCa, in high-risk patients. Finally, DCA demonstrated that the use of the PHI-based nomogram resulted in the highest net benefit. The main limitation of the study is the fact that only Caucasian patients were included.  Conclusions:   At external validation, the previously developed PHI-based nomogram confirmed its ability to determine the presence of PCa at biopsy. These findings provide further evidence supporting the potential role of the nomogram in the biopsy decision pathway for European men with suspected PCa.  Patient summary:   In the current study, we externally validated a Prostate Health Index-based nomogram to predict the presence of prostate cancer (PCa) at biopsy.

Materials and methods:   Pathological data of biopsy and RP specimens were analyzed in 328 consecutive patients, before (group 1; n = 135) and after (group 2; n = 193) implementation of the 2005 ISUP modification. Additionally, patients had more biopsy cylinders taken in group 2 (mean 10 vs. 6.9). The agreement of GS between biopsy and RP specimens was evaluated using the kappa coefficient. GS was pooled into 3 grades: low- (GS ≤ 6), intermediate- (GS = 7), and high-grade (GS ≥ 8) prostate cancer.  Results:   Kappa coefficient for GS in group 1 and 2 was 0.261 and 0.341, respectively. For tumor grade, this was 0.308 and 0.359 for group 1 and 2, respectively. For RP specimens, there was more agreement between biopsy and RP GS in group 2 compared with group 1 (53.9% vs. 37.8%). Upgrading was almost exclusively (89.5%) seen in patients with biopsy GS ≤ 6 and was lower in group 2 (25.4% vs. 48.1%) because of classification of more intermediate- and high-grade tumors using the 2005 ISUP modification.

MCO-IMRT plans using 20 and 7 treatment fields were generated for each patient on the RayStation treatment planning system (clinical version 2.5, RaySearch Laboratories, Stockholm, Sweden). The resulting DVH of the 20-field MCO-IMRT plan for each patient was used as the reference DVH, and the extracted point values of the resulting DVH of the MCO-IMRT plan were used as objectives and constraints for VMAT optimization. Weights of objectives or constraints of VMAT optimization or both were further tuned to generate the best match with the reference DVH of the MCO-IMRT plan. The final optimal VMAT plan quality was evaluated by comparison with MCO-IMRT plans based on homogeneity index, conformity number of planning target volume, and organ at risk sparing. The influence of gantry spacing, arc number, and delivery time on VMAT plan quality for different tumor sites was also evaluated. The resulting VMAT plan quality essentially matched the 20-field MCO-IMRT plan but with a shorter delivery time and less monitor units. VMAT plan quality of head/neck cancer cases improved using dual arcs whereas prostate cases did not. VMAT plan quality was improved by fine gantry spacing of 2 for the head/neck cancer cases and the hypofractionation-treated prostate cancer cases but not for the standard fractionation-treated prostate cancer cases. MCO-informed VMAT optimization is a useful and valuable way to generate patient-specific optimal VMAT plans, though modification of the weights of objectives or constraints extracted from resulting DVH of MCO-IMRT or both is necessary.""","""['Huixiao Chen', 'David L Craft', 'David P Gierga']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Med Dosim""","""['Efficiency gains for spinal radiosurgery using multicriteria optimization intensity modulated radiation therapy guided volumetric modulated arc therapy planning.', 'Efficiency of biological versus physical optimization for single-arc VMAT for prostate and head and neck cases.', 'SU-E-T-630: MCO-Informed VMAT Planning for Prostate Cancer.', 'Artificial intelligence applications in intensity modulated radiation treatment planning: an overview.', 'Advances in Automated Treatment Planning.', 'IMPT of head and neck cancer: unsupervised machine learning treatment planning strategy for reducing radiation dermatitis.', 'Artificial Intelligence in Radiation Therapy.', 'Evaluation of auto-planning in VMAT for locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma.', 'Multi-criteria optimization for planning volumetric-modulated arc therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Automation in intensity modulated radiotherapy treatment planning-a review of recent innovations.']"""

First, long-term results were previously published (specific Kiel method). This study aims to evaluate 10-/15-year outcomes of Kiel Protocol 1 (1986-1992).  Methods and materials:   Conformal external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) was delivered to the pelvis (50 Gy per conventional fractionation) along with an HDR boost to the prostate amounting to a combined biologic equivalent dose in 2 Gy per fraction of 117.25 Gy (α/β = 3). The HDR-BT was performed in two fractions of 15 Gy to the peripheral zone of McNeal. The EBRT-clinical target volume covered the full pelvis. The analyzed cohort totaled 122 patients. The reported end points were overall/cancer-specific survival, local recurrence/distant metastasis rates, and biochemical (BC) control rates according to American Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology/Phoenix definitions. All end points were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method and the log-rank test in univariate analyses.  Results:   The mean follow-up time was 116.8 months. The 5-, 10-, and 15-year survival rates were 81%, 62.1%, and 45% for overall survival; 92.1%, 83.1%, and 75.3% for cancer-specific survival; 92.5%, 91.4%, and 83.9% for local recurrence-free survival; and 83.8%, 81.2%, and 69.8% for distant metastasis-free survival, respectively. American Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology-defined BC tumor control rates at 5, 10, and 15 years were 81.1%, 74%, and 67.8%, respectively. According to Phoenix, the BC control rates at 5, 10, and 15 years were 77.8%, 69%, and 63.6%, respectively.  Conclusions:   The long-term results for the combination of HDR-BT and EBRT continue to show excellent results, providing high equivalent dose in 2 Gy per fraction and high disease control rates.

Materials and methods:   A retrospective outcome study was conducted on 164 eligible PCa samples from the City of Hope (n = 90) and the Taipei Medical University (n = 74). The RRM2 protein levels were detected by immunohistochemistry. Biochemical recurrence was assessed using Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazard analyses. Cell invasion assays, Ras/Raf, and matrix metallopeptidase 9 activities were determined to evaluate the role of RRM2 on invasiveness of PCa.  Results:   Expression of RRM2 was significantly increased in patients with higher Gleason score, who had advanced T stage, and who were margin/capsule positive (P<0.05). Analysis revealed that the expression of RRM2 positively associated with biochemical recurrence of PCa in the City of Hope set (hazard ratio = 5.26; 95% CI 1.50-24.71) and the Taipei Medical University set (hazard ratio = 2.55; 95% CI 1.30-9.22). In stratification analysis, RRM2 was significantly correlated with poor outcome in patients with lower-risk PCa, including those with Gleason score 4 to 7, margin(-), capsule(-), and stage T1-T2. In patients with Gleason score 4 to 7, the risk of recurrence was proportional to RRM2 protein levels. The prognostic performance of RRM2 was superior to that of pathoclinical factors, including margin/capsule status and T stage.

RA signaling has been implicated in growth-inhibition of malignant PCA, and intracellular RA homeostasis has been investigated as a potential therapeutic target. Minocycline is a tetracycline antibiotic with pleiotropic actions in many tissues and reaches comparably high levels in human prostate tissue. Interestingly, minocycline exhibits the rare side effect of a pseudotumor cerebri, which is otherwise known to occur from vitamin A intoxication or in retinoid therapy. Therefore, we hypothesized minocycline to putatively interact with intracellular RA homeostasis in PCA.  Methods:   Using LN-CAP, DU-145, and PC-3 cell lines, effects of minocycline on microsomal RA metabolism and on cell growth were assessed in vitro.  Results:   Minocycline was identified to potently inhibit cell growth, at concentrations within the range of tissue levels readily reached under standard therapeutic conditions. In vitro inhibition experiments revealed inhibition of RA breakdown, yet only at comparably high concentrations of minocycline. Using all trans-RA, RA metabolism inhibitor liarozole, and different retinoid receptor antagonists, the putative RA-dependent effects of minocycline were further evaluated and confirmed to be independent of RA signaling.  Conclusion:   Our findings add to the growing body of evidence for the many pleiotropic actions of minocycline. In view of the striking effects of minocycline on cell growth in PCA cell lines in vitro and its relatively safe side effect profile, the use of minocycline for targeting PCA should be timely clinically evaluated.""","""['Francesca Regen', 'Isabella Heuser', 'Irmelin Herzog', 'Julian Hellmann-Regen']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Urology""","""['Inhibition of retinoic acid catabolism by minocycline: evidence for a novel mode of action?', ""Inhibition of brain retinoic acid catabolism: a mechanism for minocycline's pleiotropic actions?"", 'Zoledronic acid in combination with serine/threonine phosphatase inhibitors induces enhanced cytotoxicity and apoptosis in hormone-refractory prostate cancer cell lines by decreasing the activities of PP1 and PP2A.', 'Retinoic acid induces expression of the interleukin-1beta gene in cultured normal human mammary epithelial cells and in human breast carcinoma lines.', 'Insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 mediates retinoic acid- and transforming growth factor beta2-induced growth inhibition in human breast cancer cells.', 'A Drug Screening Reveals Minocycline Hydrochloride as a Therapeutic Option to Prevent Breast Cancer Cells Extravasation across the Blood-Brain Barrier.', 'Minocycline in Treating Glioblastoma Multiforme: Far beyond a Conventional Antibiotic.', 'Clozapine modulates retinoid homeostasis in human brain and normalizes serum retinoic acid deficit in patients with schizophrenia.', 'Anti-inflammatory effects of minocycline are mediated by retinoid signaling.', 'Drug Repositioning for Effective Prostate Cancer Treatment.']"""

It has been extensively used as a folk medicine by many cultures. Pomegranate fruit has been shown to have the inhibitory efficacy against prostate cancer and lung cancer in vitro and in vivo. It can be exploited in chemoprevention and chemotherapy of prostate cancer. In this study we examined the anti-cancer efficacy of pomegranate fruit grown in Taiwan against urinary bladder urothelial carcinoma (UBUC) and its mechanism of action.  Methods:   Edible portion of Taiwanese pomegranate was extracted using ethanol and the anti-cancer effectiveness of ethanol extract was evaluated by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. Flow cytometry and western immunoblotting were exploited to uncover the molecular pathways underlying anti-UBUC activity of Taiwanese pomegranate ethanol extract.  Results:   This study demonstrated that Taiwanese pomegranate fruit ethanol extract (PEE) could effectively restrict the proliferation of UBUC T24 and J82 cells. Cell cycle analyses indicated that the S phase arrest induced by PEE treatment might be caused by an increase in cyclin A protein level and a decrease in the expression of cyclin-dependent kinase 1. The results of western immunoblotting demonstrated that PEE treatment could not only evoke the activation of pro-caspase-3, -8,-9 but also increase Bax/Bcl-2 ratio in T24 cells. The above observations implicated that PEE administration might trigger the apoptosis in T24 cells through death receptor signaling and mitochondrial damage pathway. Besides we found that PEE exposure to T24 cells could provoke intensive activation of procaspase-12 and enhance the expressions of CHOP and Bip, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress marker, suggesting that ER stress might be the cardinal apoptotic mechanism of PEE-induced inhibition of bladder cancer cell.

Formononetin-induced cell apoptosis was measured by Hoechst 33258 staining and flow cytometry. Expression of Bax mRNA was detected by real-time PCR, and the expression levels of Bax and IGF-1 R proteins were detected by western blots. Results: At concentrations >12.5 μM, formononetin significantly inhibited the proliferation of human prostate cancer cells. Formononetin increased Bax mRNA and protein expression levels and decreased the expression levels of pIGF-1 R protein in a dose-dependent manner.

Metabolic data were used to derive biochemical pathways that were enriched in CRPC, using Oncomine concept maps (OCM). The enriched pathways were then examined in-silico for their association with treatment failure (i.e., prostate specific antigen (PSA) recurrence or biochemical recurrence) using published clinically annotated gene expression data sets. Our results indicate that a total of 19 metabolites were altered in CRPC compared to AD cell lines. These altered metabolites mapped to a highly interconnected network of biochemical pathways that describe UDP glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) activity.

These improvements are important in the current economic context. Our aim was to evaluate the feasibility and safety of hospital discharge 24 h after laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (LRP).  Methods:   A total of 266 consecutive patients with clinical diagnosis of localized prostate cancer consecutively treated with extraperitoneal LRP between May 2007 and December 2010 were analyzed. There were no exclusion criteria for the surgical procedure. Patients were discharged in less than 24 h only in the case of absence of medical complications, with drainage of less than 50 mL allowing its removal before discharge, normal oral feeding tolerance, no significant hematuria by bladder catheter and good functional recovery of the patient. All surgery-related complications that occurred within 90 days after surgery were recorded and were classified according to the modified Clavien scale.  Results:   A total of 266 patients who underwent LRP were studied with a median follow-up of 34 months. 80 (30.1%) patients were discharged from the hospital in less than 24h. 89 (33.4%) patients were discharged within 48 h and 97 (36.5%) after 48 h.The mean hospital stay of the entire case series was 2.9 days (SD 3.08). The mean hospital stay of patients who were discharged after 48 h was 5,5 days (SD 3.94) Thirty-one patients (10.7%). experienced post-surgical complications. 25 (9.31%). of them were classified as Clavien I or II, and 6 (2.2%). Clavien III or IV. A total of 9 (3.3%) patients were readmitted. Of the group of patients who were discharged within 24h only one was readmitted due to hematuria.  Conclusions:   Extraperitoneal LRP is the standard treatment for localized prostate cancer in our institution. This treatment reliably and safely allows a hospital stay shorter than 24 h in a significant percentage of our patients.""","""['Francisco Javier Díaz', 'Virginia Hernández', 'Enrique de la Peña', 'Cristina Blázquez', 'MaríaDolores Martín', 'Carlos Llorente']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Arch Esp Urol""","""['Optimization of an early discharge program after laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.', 'Laparoscopic radical prostatectomy - results of 200 consecutive cases in a Canadian medical institution.', 'Comparison of extraperitoneal laparoscopic radical prostatectomy and open retropubic radical prostatectomy at Ramathibodi Hospital, Thailand: a retrospective review.', 'Comparison of retropubic, laparoscopic and robotic radical prostatectomy: who is the winner?', 'Laparoscopic radical prostatectomy a review of the literature and comparison with open techniques.']"""

The in vivo iodide uptake by C81 cell xenografts in nude mice injected with an adenovirus carrying the hNIS gene linked to PSMA and the corresponding tumor volume fluctuation were assessed. Iodide accumulation was shown in different LNCaP cell lines after Ad.PSMApro-hNIS and Ad.CMV-hNIS infection, but not in different LNCaP cell lines after adenovirus.cytomegalovirus (Ad.CMV) infection. At each time point, higher iodide uptake was shown in the C81 cells infected with Ad.PSMApro-hNIS than in the C33 cells (P < 0.05). An in vivo animal model showed a significant difference in 131 I radioiodine uptake in the tumors infected with Ad.PSMApro-hNIS, Ad.CMV-hNIS and control virus (P < 0.05) and a maximum reduction of tumor volume in mice infected with Ad.PSMApro-hNIS.

Mild uptake was also detected in some benign diseases, such as thymoma, adrenal adenoma, and sarcoidosis. Six patients showed focal brain uptake in correspondence to a meningioma.  Conclusions:   It is necessary for nuclear physicians, during clinical practice, to consider the possibility of F-choline uptake in some benign or malignant conditions for the intrinsic pharmacologic property of the tracer.

The purpose of this article is to characterize the patients with colorectal cancer who are most likely to benefit from PSA-based screening for prostate cancer. Because the survival benefit due to PSA-based screening does not manifest until 7 years after screening is initiated, we conclude that PSA screening is most appropriate for men with a remaining life expectancy of at least 10 years.

Unfortunately, clinical success of this drug has been limited by the insurgence of cellular resistance. To address this, Paclitaxel resistance was modeled in an in vitro system using estrogen treated prostate cancer cells. This study demonstrates that emerging resistance to clinically relevant doses of Paclitaxel is associated with 17-β-estradiol (E2) treatment in PC-3 cells, but not in LNCaP cells. We found that small interfering RNA mediated knockdown of ERα lead to a decrease in E2 induced Paclitaxel resistance in androgen-independent cells. We also showed that ERα mediated the effects of estrogen, thereby suppressing androgen-independent cell proliferation and mediating Paclitaxel resistance. Furthermore, E2 promoted Prohibitin (PHB) mitochondrial-nucleus translocation via directly mediation of ERα, leading to an inhibition of cellular proliferation by PHB. Additionally, restoration of Paclitaxel sensitivity by ERα knockdown could be overcome by PHB overexpression and, conversely, PHB knockdown decreased E2 induced Paclitaxel resistance. These findings demonstrate that PHB lies downstream of ERα and mediates estrogen-dependent Paclitaxel resistance signaling cascades.""","""['Pei Dong', 'Lijuan Jiang', 'Jianye Liu', 'Zhiming Wu', 'Shengjie Guo', 'Ziling Zhang', 'Fangjian Zhou', 'Zhuowei Liu']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Estrogen receptor α attenuates therapeutic efficacy of paclitaxel on breast xenograft tumors.', 'Activation of estrogen receptor α by estradiol and cisplatin induces platinum-resistance in ovarian cancer cells.', 'Neuroglobin overexpression induced by the 17β-Estradiol-Estrogen receptor-α Pathway reduces the sensitivity of MCF-7 Breast cancer cell to paclitaxel.', 'Genomic responses from the estrogen-responsive element-dependent signaling pathway mediated by estrogen receptor alpha are required to elicit cellular alterations.', 'A repressive role for prohibitin in estrogen signaling.', 'Predictive and prognostic relevance of immunohistochemical testing of estrogen and progesterone receptors in breast cancer in South East Nigeria: A review of 417 cases.', 'Prohibitin 1 in liver injury and cancer.', 'Prohibitin: A hypothetical target for sex-based new therapeutics for metabolic and immune diseases.', 'The mitochondrial unfolded protein response and mitohormesis: a perspective on metabolic diseases.', 'Significance of prohibitin domain family in tumorigenesis and its implication in cancer diagnosis and treatment.']"""

In order to weigh epidemiologic evidence on the association of melatonin with cancer, we must first understand the laboratory and biological sources of variability in melatonin levels measured in samples. Participants for this methodological study were men enrolled in the Prostate Lung Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial (PLCO). We measured serum melatonin levels over a five year period in 97 individuals to test if melatonin levels are steady over time. The Pearson correlation coefficient between two measures separated by 1 year was 0.87, while the correlation between two measures separated by 5 years was to 0.70. In an additional cross-sectional study of 292 individuals, we used Analysis of Variance to identify differences in melatonin levels between different lifestyle and environmental characteristics. Serum melatonin levels were slightly higher in samples collected from 130 individuals during the winter, (6.36±0.59 pg/ml) than in samples collected from 119 individuals during the summer (4.83±0.62 pg/ml).

Recently, numerous studies have investigated the associations between TLR2 -196 to -174 del and two SNPs of TLR4 (rs4986790 and rs4986791) and the susceptibility to different types of cancer; however, the results remain conflicting. The aim of this study was to assess the association between TLR2 and TLR4 polymorphisms and cancer risk in a meta-analysis with eligible published studies.  Methodology/principle findings:   A dataset composed of 14627 cases and 17438 controls from 34 publications were included in a meta-analysis to evaluate the association between overall cancer risk or cancer-specific risk and three SNPs of TLRs (TLR2 -196 to -174 del, TLR4 rs4986790 and rs4986791). The results showed that all of these three polymorphisms were significantly associated with the increased cancer risk (dominant model: OR = 1.64, 95% CI: 1.04-2.60 for TLR2 -196 to -174 del; OR = 1.19, 95% CI: 1.01-1.41 for TLR4 rs4986790; and OR = 1.47, 95% CI: 1.120-1.80 for TLR4 rs4986791; respectively). In stratified analysis, we found the effect of TLR2 -196 to -174 del on cancer risk remained significant in the subgroup of Caucasians and South Asians, but not in East Asians. However, the association between rs4986791 and cancer risk was significant in both South Asians and East Asians, but not in Caucasians. Furthermore, the association between rs4986790 and cancer risk was statistically significant in digestive cancers (dominant model: OR = 1.76, 95% CI: 1.13-2.73) and female-specific cancers (dominant model: OR = 1.50, 95% CI: 1.16-1.94). However, no significant association with risk of digestive system cancers was observed for TLR2 -196 to -174 del and TLR4 rs4986791.  Conclusions/significance:   This meta-analysis presented additional evidence for the association between TLR2 and TLR4 polymorphisms and cancer risk.

AR interacts with many proteins that function to either co-activate or co-repress its activity. Caveolin-1 (Cav-1) is not found in normal prostatic epithelium, but is found in PCa, and may be an AR co-regulator protein.  Methods:   We investigated cell line-specific signatures and associations of endogenous AR and Cav-1 in six PCa cell lines of known androgen sensitivity: LNCaP (androgen sensitive); 22Rv1 (androgen responsive); PC3, DU145, and ALVA41 (androgen non-reliant); and RWPE1 (non-malignant). Protein and mRNA expression profiles were compared and electron microscopy used to identify cells with caveolar structures. For cell lines expressing both AR and Cav-1, knockdown techniques using small interfering RNA against AR or Cav-1 were used to test whether diminished expression of one affected the other. Co-sedimentation of AR and Cav-1 was used to test their association. A reporter assay for AR genomic activity was utilized following Cav-1 knockdown.  Results:   AR-expressing LNCaP and 22Rv1 cells had low endogenous Cav-1 mRNA and protein. Cell lines that expressed little or no AR (DU145, PC3, ALVA41, and RWPE1) expressed high endogenous levels of Cav-1. AR knockdown in LNCaP cells had little effect on Cav-1, but Cav-1 knockdown inhibited AR expression and genomic activity.  Conclusions:   These data show endogenous AR and Cav-1 mRNA and protein expression is inversely related in PCa cells, with Cav-1 acting on the androgen/AR signaling axis possibly as an AR co-activator, demonstrated by diminished AR genomic activity following Cav-1 knockdown.""","""['Nigel C Bennett', 'John D Hooper', 'David W Johnson', 'Glenda C Gobe']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Androgen receptor and caveolin-1 in prostate cancer.', ""Transcriptional regulation of the androgen signaling pathway by the Wilms' tumor suppressor gene WT1."", 'Androgen receptor as a regulator of ZEB2 expression and its implications in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in prostate cancer.', 'Growth hormone (GH) receptors in prostate cancer: gene expression in human tissues and cell lines and characterization, GH signaling and androgen receptor regulation in LNCaP cells.', 'Interleukin-6 regulates androgen receptor activity and prostate cancer cell growth.', 'Endocrine Disruptors and Prostate Cancer.', 'Stromal Fibroblasts Counteract the Caveolin-1-Dependent Radiation Response of LNCaP Prostate Carcinoma Cells.', 'Missing Selectivity of Targeted 4β-Phorbol Prodrugs Expected to be Potential Chemotherapeutics.', 'Dysregulation of Signaling Pathways Due to Differentially Expressed Genes From the B-Cell Transcriptomes of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Patients - A Bioinformatics Approach.', 'Expression and clinical significance of Caveolin-1 in prostate Cancer after transurethral surgery.']"""

Materials/methods:   Patients with Gleason score ≥7 adenocarcinoma were identified from our outcomes database. RT consisted of external beam, brachytherapy, or external beam with brachytherapy boost. Biopsy specimens were stained for neuroendocrine differentiation with CgA. Results were interpreted by a single pathologist. CgA staining was quantified as 0%, <1%, 1-10%, or >10% of tumor cells. Clinical outcomes were blinded at the time of pathologic evaluation.  Results:   CgA staining was performed on 289 patients. 149 patients had Gleason score 7, and 140 were Gleason score 8-10. Median follow-up was 6.5 years. For patients with <1% versus >1% CgA staining, pretreatment characteristics were well-balanced. CgA staining was detected in 90 cases (31%). 58 patients had focal positive (<1%) CgA staining, and 32 cases had >1% of tumor cells CgA positive.

In this study, we investigated the potential of pomegranate extract (PE) in targeting metastatic castration-resistant PCa and improving docetaxel chemotherapy.  Methods:   The in vitro and in vivo effect of POMx, a PE formula currently approved for clinical trials, in metastatic castration-resistant PCa cells was evaluated in experimental models.  Results:   We demonstrated that POMx exhibited potent in vitro cytotoxicity in metastatic castration-resistant PCa cells. Mechanistic studies identified survivin as a novel molecular target that may mediate the anti-cancer activity of POMx, presumably through the inhibition of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3. The in vivo administration of POMx treatment effectively inhibited survivin, induced apoptosis, retarded C4-2 tumor growth in skeleton and significantly enhanced the efficacy of docetaxel in athymic nude mice.

Our objective was to investigate expression of stem cell markers in clinical prostate cancer in relation to outcome.  Methods:   We validated immunohistochemical expression of stem cell markers in 481 prostate cancer patients and correlated expression with clinicopathologic parameters.  Results:   Sporadic expression of α2-integrin was present in a fraction of tumor cells (<5%) in 94.7% of tumors and associated with PSA > 10 ng/ml (P = 0.04). α6-Integrin expression (<5%) occurred in 28.4% patients, while ≥5% α6-integrin expression was associated with PSA≤10 ng/ml (P = 0.01), Gleason score <7 (P < 0.01) and pT2-disease (P = 0.02). α6-integrin was predictive for biochemical recurrence (P < 0.01), local recurrence (P = 0.03) and disease specific death (P = 0.03).

Conclusions:   Expression of α2-integrin and EZH2 in a small fraction of prostate cancer cells is supportive for their role as stem cell marker. Although α6-integrin was not a unique stem cell marker, it was predictive for prostate cancer biochemical and local recurrence, and disease specific death.

Twenty male patients with prostate cancer and 20 male patients with benign prostate hyperplasia were included into this study. The MDA (nanomole), DNA damage (nanograms per millilitre), and caspase-3 (nanograms per millilitre) levels were measured in prostate cancer and benign prostate hyperplasia using Elisa kits (Millipore Corporation, Billerica, MA, USA). In the prostate cancer group, serum MDA (30.96 ± 9.25) and DNA damage (4.42 ± 0.36) levels were significantly raised (p < 0.05) when compared to the benign prostate hyperplasia group (24.05 ± 8.06, 3.99 ± 0.54).

In PCa cells, siRNA/shRNA knockdown of MED15 was followed by proliferation assays with/without dihydrotestosterone (DHT), and treatments with recombinant TGF-β3. Our results show that MED15 is overexpressed in 76% of distant metastatic CRPC (CRPC(MET) ) and 70% of local-recurrent CRPC (CRPC(LOC) ), in contrast to low frequencies in androgen-sensitive PCa, and no expression in benign prostatic tissue. Furthermore, MED15 overexpression correlates with worse clinical outcome thus defining a highly lethal phenotype. Moreover, TGF-β signaling activation associates with MED15 overexpression in PCa tissues, and leads to increased expression of MED15 in PCa cells. MED15 knockdown effects phosphorylation and shuttling of p-SMAD3 to the nucleus as well as TGF-β-enhanced proliferation. In PCa tissues, MED15 overexpression associates with AR overexpression/amplification and correlates with high proliferative activity. MED15 knockdown decreases both androgen-dependent and -independent proliferation in PCa cells.

Here we studied the role of CAF estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) and found that it could protect against PCa invasion. Immunohistochemistry on prostatectomy specimens showed that PCa patients with ERα-positive stroma had a significantly lower risk for biochemical recurrence. In vitro invasion assays further confirmed that the stromal ERα was able to reduce PCa cell invasion. Dissection of the molecular mechanism revealed that the CAF ERα could function through a CAF-epithelial interaction via selectively upregulating thrombospondin 2 (Thbs2) and downregulating matrix metalloproteinase 3 (MMP3) at the protein and messenger RNA levels. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays further showed that ERα could bind to an estrogen response element on the promoter of Thbs2. Importantly, knockdown of Thbs2 led to increased MMP3 expression and interruption of the ERα mediated invasion suppression, providing further evidence of an ERα-Thbs2-MMP3 axis in CAF. In vivo studies using athymic nude mice injected with CWR22Rv1 (22Rv1) PCa epithelial cells and CAF cells ± ERα also confirmed that mice coimplanted with PCa cells and CAF ERα+ cells had less tumor foci in the pelvic lymph nodes, less metastases, and tumors showed less angiogenesis, MMP3, and MMP9 (an MMP3 downstream target) positive staining. Together, these data suggest that CAF ERα could play protective roles in suppressing PCa metastasis.

After radiotherapy recurrence is determined by an increase in prostate specific antigen and not usually by pathological confirmation. We describe the prevalence of persistent gradable prostate cancer in men treated with radiotherapy for prostate cancer at radical cystoprostatectomy for bladder cancer.  Materials and methods:   A total of 78 patients underwent radiotherapy (brachytherapy and/or external beam radiation) before the development of bladder cancer requiring radical cystectomy at our institution. All tissues were evaluated by a specialized genitourinary pathologist.  Results:   Median time from radiotherapy to radical cystoprostatectomy was 77 months. Gradable prostate cancer was identified in 45% of patients. Of the tumors 69% were Gleason score 7 or greater, 17% were pT3 or greater and 5% showed positive lymph nodes. Men treated more recently were less likely to have gradable prostate cancer, including 100% before 1980, 49% between 1980 and 2000 and 10% from 2000 to the present (p=0.002) as were those who received external beam radiation alone compared to brachytherapy and combined brachytherapy/external beam radiation (58% vs 27% and 14%, respectively, p=0.005).  Conclusions:   After radiotherapy 45% of men had persistent prostate cancer (37% of men with no evidence of disease). A decreased prostate cancer rate was associated with later treatment year and combined brachytherapy/external beam radiation regimens. Similar to men treated with radical cystoprostatectomy for muscle invasive bladder cancer, meticulous attention should be paid during prostate removal in men treated with radiotherapy because many may have persistent prostate cancer. In addition, markers other than prostate specific antigen should be studied in men treated with radiotherapy to better identify those with biochemical recurrence.""","""['Joshua J Meeks', 'Sean Q Kern', 'Guido Dalbagni', 'James A Eastham', 'Jaspreet S Sandhu']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Editorial comment.', 'Radiation therapy for prostate cancer increases subsequent risk of bladder and rectal cancer: a population based cohort study.', 'Incidental prostate cancer in Asian men: high prevalence of incidental prostatic adenocarcinoma in Chinese patients undergoing radical cystoprostatectomy for treatment of bladder cancer and selection of candidates for prostate-sparing cystectomy.', 'Functional and oncological outcome of salvage prostatectomy of locally recurrent prostate cancer following radiation therapy.', 'Management of localised prostate cancer: watchful waiting, surgery or radiation therapy, depending on the natural course, which is often relatively slow.', 'Is brachytherapy comparable with radical prostatectomy and external-beam radiation for clinically localized prostate cancer?', 'Radical or Not-So-Radical Prostatectomy: Do Surgical Margins Matter?', 'Evaluation of the residual prostate cancer rate on cystoprostatectomy specimen in patients treated with radiotherapy for prostate cancer.']"""

An attribute of high intensity focused ultrasound is that it can be repeated. We determined morbidity after primary and redo high intensity focused ultrasound.  Materials and methods:   We performed an academic lead analysis of United Kingdom registry data on high intensity focused ultrasound treatments at 3 centers using patient reported continence and sexual function outcomes. Validated questionnaires were completed before and after each ultrasound treatment.  Results:   A total of 359 patients received 1 whole gland high intensity focused ultrasound treatment for localized prostate cancer from October 2004 to June 2012, of whom 130 (36.2%) received re-treatment. Median followup was 27 months (range 3 to 81) after re-treatment. When analyzing adverse events, 10.8% of patients experienced urinary tract infection after the first treatment compared to 3.9% after re-treatment (p=0.009). Urethral dilatation was required in 13.8% and 14.0% of patients after first and redo ultrasound treatments (p=0.7), and bladder neck incision was required in 9.2% and 11.6%, respectively (p=0.2). Before and after re-treatment 73.3% and 55.1% of patients had no leak, and 2.7% and 9.0% used daily pads (p<0.001 and p=0.07, respectively). Analysis of erectile function showed that 56.2% and 56.0% of patients were potent before and after re-treatment, respectively (p=0.9).  Conclusions:   Redo high intensity focused ultrasound is associated with an increase in urinary side effects but sexual side effects do not appear to be significantly increased. The number of adverse events seems to be equivalent after first and redo treatments.

This allows dose monitoring at five points rather than just at single dose point as in the other versions of the device. The detector has been used in a clinical trial, which is the first to measure both urethral dose and internal motion concurrently during permanent seed implantation for prostate brachytherapy using a single probe.  Methods and materials:   The RADPOS detector was secured inside a Foley catheter inside the patient's urethra. Spatial coordinates of the RADPOS detector were read every 0.5s, and the timing of events such as needle insertion was noted. The MOSFET readings were taken over two 10-min periods; once all seeds had been implanted both before and after the transrectal ultrasound (TRUS), the probe was removed. Measurements were completed for 16 patients.  Results:   Maximum integral dose in the prostatic urethral ranged from 89 to 195Gy, and dose varied from -66% to 36% depending on the rectal probe position. The change in position of the RADPOS sensor owing to the removal of the TRUS probe ranged from 1.4 to 9.7mm.  Conclusions:   The modified RADPOS detector with MOSFET array is able to provide real-time dose information, which can be used to monitor dose rates while implantation is performed and to estimate the total integrated dose. Changes in position including those owing to the TRUS probe can be significant and should be quantified to evaluate the influence on dose distributions.""","""['Amanda J Cherpak', 'Joanna E Cygler', 'Choan E', 'Gad Perry']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Brachytherapy""","""['Poster - Thur Eve - 03: LDR to HDR: RADPOS applications in brachytherapy.', 'In vivo dosimetry for gynaecological brachytherapy using a novel position sensitive radiation detector: feasibility study.', 'In vivo dosimetry using a linear Mosfet-array dosimeter to determine the urethra dose in 125I permanent prostate implants.', 'In vivo dosimetry with a linear MOSFET array to evaluate the urethra dose during permanent implant brachytherapy using iodine-125.', 'Optical fibre sensors: their role in in vivo dosimetry for prostate cancer radiotherapy.', 'Dosimetric outcomes of preoperative treatment planning with intraoperative optimization using stranded seeds in prostate brachytherapy.', 'Dosimetric impact of placement errors in optically stimulated luminescent in vivo dosimetry in radiotherapy.', 'In vivo dosimetry: trends and prospects for brachytherapy.']"""

We recently established the Southern African Prostate Cancer Study (SAPCS), a resource for epidemiological and genetic analysis of prostate cancer risk and outcomes in Black men from South Africa. Biased towards highly aggressive prostate cancer disease, this is the first reported data analysis.  Methods:   The SAPCS is an ongoing population-based study of Black men with or without prostate cancer. Pilot analysis was performed for the first 837 participants, 522 cases and 315 controls. We investigate 46 pre-defined prostate cancer risk alleles and up to 24 epidemiological measures including demographic, lifestyle and environmental factors, for power to predict disease status and to drive on-going SAPCS recruitment, sampling procedures and research direction.  Results:   Preliminary results suggest that no previously defined risk alleles significantly predict prostate cancer occurrence within the SAPCS. Furthermore, genetic risk profiles did not enhance the predictive power of prostate specific antigen (PSA) testing. Our study supports several lifestyle/environmental factors contributing to prostate cancer risk including a family history of cancer, diabetes, current sexual activity and erectile dysfunction, balding pattern, frequent aspirin usage and high PSA levels.  Conclusions:   Despite a clear increased prostate cancer risk associated with an African ancestry, experimental data is lacking within Africa. This pilot study is therefore a significant contribution to the field. While genetic risk factors (largely European-defined) show no evidence for disease prediction in the SAPCS, several epidemiological factors were associated with prostate cancer status. We call for improved study power by building on the SAPCS resource, further validation of associated factors in independent African-based resources, and genome-wide approaches to define African-specific risk alleles.""","""['Elizabeth A Tindall', 'M S Riana Bornman', 'Smit van Zyl', 'Alpheus M Segone', 'L Richard Monare', 'Philip A Venter', 'Vanessa M Hayes']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""BMC Urol""","""['African KhoeSan ancestry linked to high-risk prostate cancer.', 'Clinical presentation of prostate cancer in black South Africans.', 'Mining laboratory data to describe prostate specific antigen testing and prostate cancer in Johannesburg, South Africa.', 'Do African-American men need separate prostate cancer screening guidelines?', 'Epidemiological fundamentals of clinically localized prostate cancer.', 'Prostate Cancer Genomics Research Disparities in Africa: Advancing Knowledge in Resource Constrained Settings.', 'Metagenomic analysis reveals a rich bacterial content in high-risk prostate tumors from African men.', 'African KhoeSan ancestry linked to high-risk prostate cancer.', 'Prostate cancer genomics and racial health disparity.', 'Prostate Cancer in Southern Africa: Does Africa Hold Untapped Potential to Add Value to the Current Understanding of a Common Disease?']"""

However, because of delayed immune responses, its clinical benefits, besides for overall survival (OS), are not well captured by the World Health Organization (WHO) and Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria. Several surrogate markers for evaluation of cancer vaccine, including prostate-specific antigen doubling time (PSADT), are currently sought. The purpose of this study was to assess prospectively the PSA kinetics and immune responses, as well as the efficacy, safety, and biomarkers of personalized peptide vaccination (PPV) in progressive CRPC.  Methods:   One hundred patients with progressive CRPC were treated with PPV using 2-4 positive peptides from 31 candidate peptides determined by both human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class IA types and the levels of immunoglobulin G (IgG) against each peptide. The association between immune responses and PSADT as well as overall survival (OS) was studied.  Results:   PPV was safe and well tolerated in all patients with a median survival time of 18.8 months. Peptide-specific IgG and T-cell responses strongly correlated with PSADT (p < 0.0001 and p = 0.0007, respectively), which in turn showed correlation with OS (p = 0.018). Positive IgG responses and prolongation of PSADT during PPV were also significantly associated with OS (p = 0.001 and p = 0.004) by multivariate analysis.  Conclusions:   PSADT could be an appropriate surrogate marker for evaluation of the clinical benefit of cancer vaccine. Further randomized trials are needed to confirm these results.

Methods:   The study used data from the 2011 U.S. National Health and Wellness Survey, an Internet-based questionnaire of a nationwide sample of adults. UUI or MUI respondents were identified via three Incontinence Questions. Respondents with stress urinary incontinence only, prostate cancer or (medication for) benign prostatic hyperplasia were excluded. UUI/MUI respondents were categorised as Rx users for overactive bladder (OAB) and non-Rx users (who never used Rx and whose condition reportedly interfered with life activities or was difficult to manage). Outcome measures included healthcare utilisation and Work Productivity and Activity Impairment questionnaire-based scores. Direct and indirect costs were estimated using 2010 labour and 2008 medical expenditure data sources. Generalised linear models predicted resource use and productivity as a function of treatment status, adjusting for covariates (e.g. sociodemographics, OAB severity, comorbid status) that may also predict impairment.  Results:   Rx (vs. non-Rx) users were more likely to be female (80.7% vs. 70.0%), older (mean = 62.7 vs. 53.1) and reporting more moderate-to-severe OAB (70.9% vs. 52.6%; all p < 0.05).

Objective:   To examine the overall visit structure and how patients and physicians transition between communication activities during visits in which patients received new prostate cancer diagnoses.  Participants:   Forty veterans and 18 urologists at one VA medical centre.  Methods:   We coded 40 transcripts to identify major communication activities during visits and used empiric discourse analysis to analyse transitions between activities.  Results:   We identified five communication activities that occurred in the following typical sequence: 'diagnosis delivery', 'risk classification', 'options talk', 'decision talk' and 'next steps'. The first two activities were typically brief and involved minimal patient participation. Options talk was typically the longest activity; physicians explicitly announced the beginning of options talk and framed it as their professional responsibility. Some patients were unsure of the purpose of visit and/or who should make treatment decisions.  Conclusion:   Visits to deliver the diagnosis of early stage prostate cancer follow a regular sequence of communication activities. Physicians focus on discussing treatment options and devote comparatively little time and attention to discussing the new cancer diagnosis. Towards the goal of promoting patient-centred communication, physicians should consider eliciting patient reactions after diagnosis delivery and explaining the decision-making process before describing treatment options.""","""['Stephen G Henry', 'Danielle Czarnecki', 'Valerie C Kahn', 'Wen-Ying Sylvia Chou', 'Angela Fagerlin', 'Peter A Ubel', 'David R Rovner', 'Stewart C Alexander', 'Sara J Knight', 'Margaret Holmes-Rovner']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Health Expect""","""['Physician communication regarding prostate cancer screening: analysis of unannounced standardized patient visits.', 'Pairing physician education with patient activation to improve shared decisions in prostate cancer screening: a cluster randomized controlled trial.', 'Informed Decision Making: Assessment of the Quality of Physician Communication about Prostate Cancer Diagnosis and Treatment.', ""What's new in screening in 2015?"", 'American Urological Association (AUA) guideline on prostate cancer detection: process and rationale.', 'The Challenge of Coming Out to Providers by Gay and Bisexual Men With Prostate Cancer: Qualitative Results from the Restore Study.', ""Experiences of 'traditional' and 'one-stop' MRI-based prostate cancer diagnostic pathways in England: a qualitative study with patients and GPs."", 'Preparing Patients with Early Stage Prostate Cancer to Participate in Clinical Appointments Using a Shared Decision Making Training Video.', 'Patient Participation in Communication about Treatment Decision-Making for Localized Prostate Cancer during Consultation Visits.', 'Visit Linearity in Primary Care Visits for Patients with Chronic Pain on Long-term Opioid Therapy.']"""

Methods:   Between 2003 and 2010, a total of 616 consecutive patients underwent low-dose rate brachytherapy-based therapy for clinically localized prostate cancer at Jikei University Hospital in Tokyo, Japan. Biochemical recurrence occurred in 45 (7.3%) patients at a median of 30 months (range 11-93 months). A total of 20 patients subsequently underwent transperineal template prostatic biopsy; of those, eight had positive cores at the base of the prostate or at the seminal vesicles. These eight patients had underdosed areas identified at initial low-dose rate brachytherapy corresponding to the positive biopsy sites. All were confirmed to have only localized recurrence, and seven underwent salvage partial low-dose rate brachytherapy.  Results:   Median prostate-specific antigen nadir level in the eight patients with biopsy-proven local recurrence after initial low-dose rate brachytherapy was 0.75 ng/mL (range 0.39-2.06). The seven retreated patients tolerated the salvage partial low-dose rate brachytherapy well, and showed a decrease in prostate-specific antigen level at follow up. Two patients later developed biochemical and clinical progression at 11 and 13 months, respectively. Prostate-specific antigen level continued to be low in the remaining five patients. No significant genitourinary or gastrointestinal toxicity was encountered.  Conclusions:   Salvage partial low-dose rate brachytherapy for biopsy-proven localized prostate cancer recurrence appears rational, technically feasible and safe. Optimal patient selection is of utmost importance for long-term success.

Results:   The REIC/Dkk-3 expression was lost in the pancreatic cancer cell lines and decreased in pancreatic cancer tissues. Ad-REIC induced apoptosis and inhibited cell growth in the ASPC1 and MIAPaCa2 lines in vitro, and Ad-REIC inhibited tumor growth in the mouse xenograft model using ASPC1 cells. The antitumor effect was further enhanced in combination with gemcitabine. This synergistic effect may be caused by the suppression of autophagy via the enhancement of mammalian target of rapamycin signaling.

LUTS were evaluated using DAN-PSS-1 questionnaire. A total of 1679 men (68% of the eligible) responded to both questionnaires.

Men with no medical treatment or surgery for LUTS in either questionnaire were included to no-treatment group.  Results:   The men after surgical treatment showed a reduction in all LUTS symptom groups. However, among the medically treated and untreated men, all the symptoms worsened during the follow up. The proportion of symptomatic men after surgery was lower than among the medically treated men. In men with medical treatment, the prevalence of all 12 LUTS increased. Dysuria and postmicturition dribble were the only symptoms that had slightly better results in medical than in surgical treatment group.

Intrinsic resistance to oncolysis is found in some cell lines and many primary tumors as a consequence of residual innate immunity to VSV. In resistant-tumor models, VSV oncolytic potential can be reversibly stimulated by combination with epigenetic modulators, such as the histone deacetylase inhibitor vorinostat. Based on this reversible effect of vorinostat, we reasoned that critical host genes involved in oncolysis may likewise be reversibly regulated by vorinostat. A transcriptome analysis in prostate cancer PC3 cells identified a subset of NF-κB target genes reversibly regulated by vorinostat, as well as a group of interferon (IFN)-stimulated genes (ISGs). Consistent with the induction of NF-κB target genes, vorinostat-mediated enhancement of VSV oncolysis increased hyperacetylation of NF-κB RELA/p65. Additional bioinformatics analysis revealed that NF-κB signaling also increased the expression of several autophagy-related genes. Kinetically, autophagy preceded apoptosis, and apoptosis was observed only when cells were treated with both VSV and vorinostat. VSV replication and cell killing were suppressed when NF-κB signaling was inhibited using pharmacological or genetic approaches. Inhibition of autophagy by 3-methyladenine (3-MA) enhanced expression of ISGs, and either 3-MA treatment or genetic ablation of the autophagic marker Atg5 decreased VSV replication and oncolysis. Together, these data demonstrate that vorinostat stimulates NF-κB activity in a reversible manner via modulation of RELA/p65 signaling, leading to induction of autophagy, suppression of the IFN-mediated response, and subsequent enhancement of VSV replication and apoptosis.""","""['Laura Shulak', 'Vladimir Beljanski', 'Cindy Chiang', 'Sucharita M Dutta', 'Julien Van Grevenynghe', 'S Mehdi Belgnaoui', 'Thi Lien-Anh Nguyên', 'Thomas Di Lenardo', 'O John Semmes', 'Rongtuan Lin', 'John Hiscott']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Virol""","""['Curcumin promotes the oncoltyic capacity of vesicular stomatitis virus for the treatment of prostate cancers.', 'SIRT1 Modulates the Sensitivity of Prostate Cancer Cells to Vesicular Stomatitis Virus Oncolysis.', 'Activation of Nrf2 Signaling Augments Vesicular Stomatitis Virus Oncolysis via Autophagy-Driven Suppression of Antiviral Immunity.', 'VSV-tumor selective replication and protein translation.', 'Oncotargeting by Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV): Advances in Cancer Therapy.', 'Autophagy: A Potential Therapeutic Target to Tackle Drug Resistance in Multiple Myeloma.', 'The role of viruses in cancer development versus cancer therapy: An oncological perspective.', 'Cellular resistance to an oncolytic virus is driven by chronic activation of innate immunity.', 'Potentiating effect of reovirus on immune checkpoint inhibition in microsatellite stable colorectal cancer.', 'A Genome-Wide CRISPR-Cas9 Loss-of-Function Screening to Identify Host Restriction Factors Modulating Oncolytic Virotherapy.']"""

We previously reported that the expression of miR-205, a miRNA down-regulated in prostate cancer, is further repressed in prostate cancer cells undergoing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, suggesting a possible involvement of the miRNA in the acquisition of the chemoresistant phenotype. In the present study, we show that miR-205 replacement in castration-resistant mesenchymal prostate cancer cells caused an enhancement of cisplatin cytotoxic activity in vitro and in vivo, as a consequence of autophagy impairment. Specifically, the constraints on the autophagic flux were associated to the miRNA-dependent down-regulation of the lysosome-associated proteins RAB27A and LAMP3. These findings suggest that miR-205-mediated impairment of the autophagic pathway may interfere with the detoxifying capabilities of prostate cancer cells in their attempt to cope with cisplatin-induced detrimental effects. Overall, our data indicate that (i) loss of miR-205 may indeed contribute to acquire mesenchymal tracts and concomitantly establish a permissive autophagic milieu that confers a chemotherapy resistant phenotype to prostate cancer cells, and (ii) strategies aimed at restoring miR-205 expression levels may represent a successful approach to overcome resistance of prostate cancer to platinum compounds.""","""['Marzia Pennati', 'Alessia Lopergolo', 'Valentina Profumo', 'Michelandrea De Cesare', 'Stefania Sbarra', 'Riccardo Valdagni', 'Nadia Zaffaroni', 'Paolo Gandellini', 'Marco Folini']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Biochem Pharmacol""","""['MicroRNA-181a enhances the chemoresistance of human cervical squamous cell carcinoma to cisplatin by targeting PRKCD.', 'Loss of miR-200c expression induces an aggressive, invasive, and chemoresistant phenotype in non-small cell lung cancer.', 'Role of microRNAs in drug-resistant ovarian cancer cells.', 'The relationship between platinum drug resistance and epithelial-mesenchymal transition.', 'miRNA as Regulators of Prostate Carcinogenesis and Endocrine and Chemoresistance.', 'The Role of mTORC1 Pathway and Autophagy in Resistance to Platinum-Based Chemotherapeutics.', 'MicroRNAs as the critical regulators of autophagy-mediated cisplatin response in tumor cells.', 'Insight into autophagy in platinum resistance of cancer.', 'microRNA-205 in prostate cancer: Overview to clinical translation.', 'Targeting autophagy in prostate cancer: preclinical and clinical evidence for therapeutic response.']"""

Although an osteolytic component governed by activation of bone resorbing osteoclasts is prominent in prostate cancer metastasis, the molecular mechanisms of prostate cancer-induced osteoclastogenesis are not well-understood.  Methods:   We studied the effect of soluble mediators released from human prostate carcinoma cells on osteoclast formation from mouse bone marrow and RAW 264.7 monocytes.  Results:   Soluble factors released from human prostate carcinoma cells significantly increased viability of naïve bone marrow monocytes, as well as osteoclastogenesis from precursors primed with receptor activator of nuclear factor κ-B ligand (RANKL). The prostate cancer-induced osteoclastogenesis was not mediated by RANKL as it was not inhibited by osteoprotegerin (OPG). However inhibition of TGFβ receptor I (TβRI), or macrophage-colony stimulating factor (MCSF) resulted in attenuation of prostate cancer-induced osteoclastogenesis. We characterized the signaling pathways induced in osteoclast precursors by soluble mediators released from human prostate carcinoma cells. Prostate cancer factors increased basal calcium levels and calcium fluctuations, induced nuclear localization of nuclear factor of activated t-cells (NFAT)c1, and activated prolonged phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in RANKL-primed osteoclast precursors. Inhibition of calcium signaling, NFATc1 activation, and ERK1/2 phosphorylation significantly reduced the ability of prostate cancer mediators to stimulate osteoclastogenesis.
