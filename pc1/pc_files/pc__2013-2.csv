Patients and methods:   From November 1999 to January 2007, 223 patients with a histologic diagnosis (204 transperineal needle biopsies; 19 trans-urethral prostatic resections) of locally advanced prostate cancer underwent external beam radiotherapy; of these patients, 151 were T3a (extracapsular extension) and 72 were T3b (involvement of seminal vesicles); the extracapsular extension was demonstrated using pelvic RMN or transrectal ultrasound, while the presence of distant and lymph node metastases was excluded using TC total body or bone scan. PSA value at diagnosis was 29.1 ng/mL (0.4-379 ng/mL). Radiotherapy was used on prostate and seminal vesicles in 201 patients (141 T3a; 60 T3b) while in 22 patients (10 T3a; 12 T3b) it was extended to the pelvis. Biochemical recurrence was defined using ASTRO definition (three consecutive PSA rises after PSA nadir); no patients underwent control prostate needle biopsy for problems of interpretation related to postactinic tissue changes. All complications were recorded and analyzed using Radiation Morbidity Scoring Criteria (RTOG).  Results:   At a mean 55-month follow-up, of the 223 patients treated, 26 have escaped controls, 168 are alive (141 disease-free; 27 with recurrent disease) and 29 died; of this group, 11 patients died from clinical progression, while in the others the cause was not related to the prostatic problem; only one patient died from iatrogenic problems. Hormone treatment was conducted in different ways (neoadjuvant, adjuvant, concurrent to radiotherapy or in association) considering patients' characteristics. Most common complications involved rectum and bladder.   Conclusions:   Radiotherapy is a viable and safe method in the treatment of locally advanced prostate cancer; however, it is essential the role of hormone therapy.""","""['Luca Giovanessi', 'Alessandro Antonelli', 'Nicola Bastiani', 'Francesca Trevisan', 'Stefano Maria Magrini', 'Sergio Cosciani Cunico', 'Claudio Simeone']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Urologia""","""['Improved biochemical outcome with adjuvant radiotherapy after radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer with poor pathologic features.', 'Salvage radiotherapy for biochemical and clinical failures following radical prostatectomy.', 'Long-term outcome following three-dimensional conformal/intensity-modulated external-beam radiotherapy for clinical stage T3 prostate cancer.', 'Locally advanced prostate cancer: definition, prognosis and treatment.', 'Management strategies for locally advanced prostate cancer.']"""

We used repeated measurements of glucose and fructosamine to get more insight into the association between the glucose metabolism and risk of cancer.  Methods:   We selected 11,998 persons (>20 years old) with four prospectively collected serum glucose and fructosamine measurements from the Apolipoprotein Mortality Risk (AMORIS) study. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression was used to assess standardized log of overall mean glucose and fructosamine in relation to cancer risk. Similar analyses were performed for tertiles of glucose and fructosamine and for different types of cancer.  Results:   A positive trend was observed between standardized log overall mean glucose and overall cancer risk (HR= 1.08; 95% CI: 1.02-1.14). Including standardized log fructosamine in the model resulted in a stronger association between glucose and cancer risk and aninverse association between fructosamine and cancer risk (HR = 1.17; 95% CI: 1.08-1.26 and HR: 0.89; 95% CI: 0.82-0.96, respectively). Cancer risks were highest among those in the highest tertile of glucose and lowest tertile of fructosamine. Similar findings were observed for prostate, lung, and colorectal cancer while none observed for breast cancer.  Conclusion:   The contrasting effect between glucose, fructosamine, and cancer risk suggests the existence of distinct groups among those with impaired glucose metabolism, resulting in different cancer risks based on individual metabolic profiles. Further studies are needed to clarify whether glucose is a proxy of other lifestyle-related or metabolic factors.""","""['Wahyu Wulaningsih', 'Lars Holmberg', 'Hans Garmo', 'Björn Zethelius', 'Annette Wigertz', 'Paul Carroll', 'Mats Lambe', 'Niklas Hammar', 'Göran Walldius', 'Ingmar Jungner', 'Mieke Van Hemelrijck']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Low fructosamine and mortality - A long term follow-up of 215,011 non-diabetic subjects in the Swedish AMORIS study.', 'Inorganic phosphate and the risk of cancer in the Swedish AMORIS study.', 'Serum fructosamine and subsequent breast cancer risk: a nested case-control study in the ORDET prospective cohort study.', 'Serum glucose, triglycerides, and cholesterol in relation to prostate cancer death in the Swedish AMORIS study.', 'Blood biomarkers of carbohydrate, lipid, and apolipoprotein metabolisms and risk of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: A more than 20-year follow-up of the Swedish AMORIS cohort.', 'Evaluation of Fructosamine 3-kinase and Glyoxalase 1 activity in normal and breast cancer tissues.', 'Metabolic Phenotyping in Prostate Cancer Using Multi-Omics Approaches.', 'Diabetes mellitus is independently associated with adverse clinical outcome in soft tissue sarcoma patients.', 'Metabolic profiles to predict long-term cancer and mortality: the use of latent class analysis.', 'Hyperglycemia, Classified with Multiple Biomarkers Simultaneously in Men without Diabetes, and Risk of Fatal Prostate Cancer.']"""

A barrier to the study of the somatic genetics of human solid tumors in vivo is the presence of admixtures of non-neoplastic cells with normal genomes in patient samples. These can obscure the presence of somatic aberrations including mutations, homozygous deletions, and breakpoints in biopsies of interest. Furthermore, clinical samples frequently contain multiple neoplastic populations that cannot be distinguished by morphology. Consequently, it is difficult to determine whether mutations detected in a sample of interest are concurrent in a single clonal population or if they occur in distinct cell populations in the same sample. The advent of targeted therapies increases the selection for preexisting populations. However the asymmetric distribution of therapeutic targets in clonal populations provides a mechanism for the rapid evolution of resistant disease. Thus, there is a need to not only isolate tumor from normal cells, but to also enrich distinct populations of clonal neoplastic cells in order to apply genome technologies to identify clinically relevant genomic aberrations that drive disease in patients in vivo. To address this we have applied single and multiparameter DNA content based flow assays to the study of solid tumors. Our work has identified examples of clonal resistance to effective therapies. This includes androgen withdrawal in advanced prostate cancer. In addition we demonstrate examples of co-existing clonal populations with highly aberrant genomes and ploidies in a wide variety of solid tumors. We propose that clonal analysis of tumors, based on flow cytometry and high resolution genome analyses of purified neoplastic populations, provides a unique approach to the study of therapeutic responses and the evolution of resistance.""","""['Michael T Barrett', 'Elizabeth Lenkiewicz', 'Lisa Evers', 'Tara Holley', 'Christian Ruiz', 'Lukas Bubendorf', 'Aleksander Sekulic', 'Ramesh K Ramanathan', 'Daniel D Von Hoff']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Front Pharmacol""","""['Advancing a clinically relevant perspective of the clonal nature of cancer.', 'Chromosomal Instability Estimation Based on Next Generation Sequencing and Single Cell Genome Wide Copy Number Variation Analysis.', 'CLImAT-HET: detecting subclonal copy number alterations and loss of heterozygosity in heterogeneous tumor samples from whole-genome sequencing data.', 'Clonal evolution and tumor-initiating cells: New dimensions in cancer patient treatment.', 'Cytogenetic analysis of tumor clonality.', 'c-Kit M541L variant is related to ineffective hemopoiesis predisposing to clonal evolution in 3D in vitro biomimetic co-culture model of bone marrow niche.', 'In Silico Investigations of Multi-Drug Adaptive Therapy Protocols.', 'Melanoma Single-Cell Biology in Experimental and Clinical Settings.', 'The Role Of Circulating Tumor DNA In Therapeutic Resistance.', 'Clinical Actionability of Comprehensive Genomic Profiling for Management of Rare or Refractory Cancers.']"""

Materials and methods:   In all, 29 prostate cancer patients who underwent 3T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) including DW imaging using b-values of 1000 s/mm(2) and 2000 s/mm(2) were included. Two radiologists independently evaluated four image sets during different sessions and recorded the location and diameter of the dominant lesion: DW images acquired using b-values of 1000 s/mm(2) and 2000 s/mm(2) and ADC maps calculated using maximal b-values of 1000 s/mm(2) and 2000 s/mm(2) . Findings were correlated with the location and diameter of the dominant lesion at prostatectomy. Tumor-to-PZ contrast was also calculated, unblinded to pathology.  Results:   Both readers achieved significantly higher sensitivity for DW images obtained using a b-value of 2000 s/mm(2) than 1000 s/mm(2) (P < 0.001), although there was no difference in sensitivity between ADC maps calculated using the two b-values (P ≥ 0.309). Tumor-to-PZ contrast was higher for DW images using a b-value of 2000 s/mm(2) (P = 0.067), although it was not different between the two corresponding ADC maps (P = 0.544). For both readers, correlations with tumor diameters were higher for either ADC map (r = 0.59-0.73) than for either acquired DW image set (r = 0.03-0.57).  Conclusion:   Use of a b-value of 2000 s/mm(2) compared with a b-value of 1000 s/mm(2) resulted in improved tumor sensitivity and higher tumor-to-PZ contrast on the acquired DW images, although performance of the ADC maps corresponding with the two b-values was similar.

Only a subset of men benefit from this therapy, and predictive markers are lacking. We hypothesized a role for insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) as a predictive marker, since IGF-1 is important in both prostate cancer progression and bone development. Hence, we determined the association of IGF-1 expression to treatment response, and whether this expression resulted from tumor cells, the microenvironment, or their interactions.  Methods:   We measured serum IGF-1 levels in men with CRPC treated with dasatinib plus docetaxel. To investigate the source of IGF-1, we utilized two different mouse models harboring human prostate cancer cells, and used species-specific IGF-1 ELISA kits (mouse vs. human).  Results:   In men with CRPC, an increase in IGF-1 levels after one cycle of treatment with dasatinib and docetaxel is associated with a higher response rate and longer duration of treatment. Xenograft experiments with subcutaneous and intratibial injection of prostate cancer cells suggest that direct interaction of prostate cancer cells with bone microenvironment is necessary for IGF-1 induction, is entirely host-derived, and occurs only in mice that respond to dasatinib-based therapy.

Mapping studies have described a minimally deleted area at 6q15, containing MAP3K7/TAK1, which was recently shown to have tumor suppressive properties. To determine prevalence and clinical significance of MAP3K7 alterations in prostate cancer, a tissue microarray containing 4699 prostate cancer samples was analyzed by fluorescence in situ hybridization. Heterozygous MAP3K7 deletions were found in 18.48% of 2289 interpretable prostate cancers. MAP3K7 deletions were significantly associated with advanced tumor stage (P<0.0001), high Gleason grade (P<0.0001), lymph node metastasis (P<0.0108) and early biochemical recurrence (P<0.0001). MAP3K7 alterations were typically limited to the loss of one allele as homozygous deletions were virtually absent and sequencing analyses revealed no evidence for MAP3K7 mutations in 15 deleted and in 14 non-deleted cancers. There was a striking inverse association of MAP3K7 deletions and TMPRSS2:ERG fusion status with 26.7% 6q deletions in 1125 ERG-negative and 11.1% 6q deletions in 1198 ERG-positive cancers (P<0.0001). However, the strong prognostic role of 6q deletions was retained in both ERG-positive and ERG-negative cancers (P<0.0001 each). In summary, our study identifies MAP3K7 deletion as a prominent feature in ERG-negative prostate cancer with strong association to tumor aggressiveness.

However, luminal occlusion often occurs due to sludge formation, tumor ingrowth, or tumor overgrowth. Currently, influx of duodenal contents by duodenobiliary reflux is considered a mechanism of stent obstruction. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a metal stent with an anti-reflux valve in distal malignant biliary obstruction.  Methods:   Thirty-two patients diagnosed with unresectable malignant biliary obstruction were enrolled. This trial was conducted at two tertiary hospitals in Korea from June 2009 to June 2011. An uncovered metal stent (M.I.Tech) with an S-type anti-reflux valve was placed.  Results:   A total of 32 patients were enrolled. The technical success rate of stent insertion was 100%. The median duration of stent patency was 14.4 months. Stent occlusion occurred in 11 cases, which was caused by sludge formation in six cases, tumor ingrowth in four cases, and migration of the stent membrane in one case. During the follow-up period, there were no episodes of ascending cholangitis, acute pancreatitis, or bleeding.  Conclusions:   The new metal stent with an S-shaped anti-reflux valve demonstrated a relatively long duration of stent patency. This was attributable to reductions in duodenobiliary reflux by the anti-reflux valve. Also, the stent with an S-shaped anti-reflux valve is technically feasible and very safe.

Results:   Three novel androgen receptor (AR) binding sites were discovered in the VEGF promoter and in vivo binding of AR to these sites was demonstrated by chromatin immunoprecipitation. Mutation of these sites attenuated activation of the VEGF promoter by the androgen analog, R1881 in prostate cancer cells. The transcription factors AR and Sp1 were shown to form a nuclear complex and both bound the VEGF core promoter in chromatin of hormone treated CWR22Rv1 prostate cancer cells. The importance of the Sp1 binding site in hormone mediated activation of VEGF expression was demonstrated by site directed mutagenesis. Mutation of a critical Sp1 binding site (Sp1.4) in the VEGF core promoter region prevented activation by androgen. Similarly, suppression of Sp1 binding by Mithramycin A treatment significantly reduced VEGF expression.  Conclusions:   Our mechanistic study of androgen mediated induction of VEGF expression in prostate cancer cells revealed for the first time that this induction is mediated through the core promoter region and is dependent upon a critical Sp1 binding site. The importance of Sp1 binding suggests that therapy targeting the AR-Sp1 complex may dampen VEGF induced angiogenesis and, thereby, block prostate cancer progression, helping to maintain the indolent form of prostate cancer.""","""['Kurtis Eisermann', 'Carly J Broderick', 'Anton Bazarov', 'Mustafa M Moazam', 'Gail C Fraizer']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Mol Cancer""","""['Androgen response element of the glycine N-methyltransferase gene is located in the coding region of its first exon.', 'Long-range activation of FKBP51 transcription by the androgen receptor via distal intronic enhancers.', 'A competitive inhibitor that reduces recruitment of androgen receptor to androgen-responsive genes.', 'A novel androgen receptor-binding element modulates Cdc6 transcription in prostate cancer cells during cell-cycle progression.', 'The role of vascular endothelial growth factor in metastatic prostate cancer to the skeleton.', 'Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor promotes angiogenesis through Sp1/Sp3-mediated inhibition of notch signaling in male mice.', 'Second generation androgen receptor antagonist, TQB3720 abrogates prostate cancer growth via AR/GPX4 axis activated ferroptosis.', 'Molecular Mechanisms of Noncoding RNA in the Occurrence of Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Gallic acid reverses ovarian disturbances in mice with letrozole-induced PCOS via modulating Adipo R1 expression.', 'Unravelling the Role of Kinases That Underpin Androgen Signalling in Prostate Cancer.']"""

Erucin (ER) is a dietary ITC, which has been recently considered a promising cancer chemopreventive phytochemical. The potential protective activity of ER against prostate cancer was investigated using prostate adenocarcinoma cells (PC3), to analyze its effects on pathways involved in cell growth regulation, such as the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDKs) inhibitor p21(WAF1/CIP1) (p21), phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase/AKT, and extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK)1/2 signaling pathways. We have shown for the first time that ER increases significantly p21 protein expression and ERK1/2 phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner to inhibit PC3 cell proliferation (P ≤ 0.01). Compared to the structurally related sulforaphane, a well-studied broccoli-derived ITC, ER showed lower potency in inhibiting proliferation of PC3 cells, as well as in modulating p21 and pERK1/2 protein levels. Neither of the naturally occurring ITCs was able to affect significantly pAKT protein levels in prostate cells at all concentrations tested (0-25 μM).

HRQoL scores are also essential for health economic analyses concerning treatment options for the disease. This study assesses HRQoL scores in different health states of PCa, compares the results obtained by different HRQoL instruments, compares the HRQoL of PCa patients with that of the general population, and explores factors associated with the resultant HRQoL scores.  Material and methods:   An observational cross-sectional study among PCa patients in the Helsinki and Uusimaa Hospital District between September 2009 and December 2010. A total of 630 PCa patients (aged 43-92) assessed their HRQoL with the generic 15D and EQ-5D, as well as the cancer-specific EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaires. Patients were divided into five mutually exclusive groups based on disease state: Loc1 (local disease, first six months after diagnosis; n = 47), Loc2 (local disease, 0.5-1.5 years after diagnosis or recurrence; n = 158), Loc3 (local disease, more than 1.5 years after diagnosis; n = 317), Metastatic (after detection of metastases; n = 89) and Palliative care (n = 19). Multivariate analysis served to evaluate the factors associated with the HRQoL scores.  Results:   The utility scores were highest at baseline. Markedly impaired HRQoL was seen first at the more advanced states of the disease. All HRQoL instruments studied were consistent in all states of the disease, yet the HRQoL scores obtained varied widely. Symptoms of fatigue and pain, and background variables of financial difficulties and age were the most important factors associated with poor HRQoL.  Conclusions:   All instruments provided valuable insight into PCa patients' overall HRQoL. Management of cancer-related symptoms is important in maintaining patients' HRQoL, but more attention should also focus on financial difficulties.""","""['Saku Torvinen', 'Niilo Färkkilä', 'Harri Sintonen', 'Tiina Saarto', 'Risto P Roine', 'Kimmo Taari']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Acta Oncol""","""['Health-related quality of life in colorectal cancer.', 'Health-related quality of life in different states of breast cancer - comparing different instruments.', 'Health-related quality of life among prostate cancer patients: real-life situation at the beginning of treatment.', 'USE OF PATIENT ASSESSED HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE INSTRUMENTS IN PROSTATE CANCER RESEARCH: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE 2002-15.', 'Quality-of-life assessment tools for men with prostate cancer.', 'Responsiveness and construct validity of EPIC-26, AQoL-6D and SF-6D following treatment in prostate cancer.', 'Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA) Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography (PET/CT) for the Primary Staging of Prostate Cancer in Australia.', 'Estimation of Utility Weights for Prostate-related Health States in Korea.', 'Systematic Review of Cost-Effectiveness Models in Prostate Cancer: Exploring New Developments in Testing and Diagnosis.', 'Clinical values of expression signature of circCDR1AS and circHIAT1 in prostate cancer: Two circRNAs with regulatory function in androgen receptor (AR) and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways.']"""

Conventionally, nonlinear deformable registration techniques have been utilized to account for such deformation. In this work, we present a model-based technique for accounting for the deformation of the prostate gland in ERC-MR imaging, in which a unique deformation vector is estimated for every point within the prostate gland. Modes of deformation for every point in the prostate are statistically identified using a set of MR-based training set (with and without ERC-MRI). Deformation of the prostate from a deformed (ERC-MRI) to a non-deformed state in a different modality (CT) is then realized by first calculating partial deformation information for a limited number of points (such as surface points or anatomical landmarks) and then utilizing the calculated deformation from a subset of the points to determine the coefficient values for the modes of deformations provided by the statistical deformation model.

One of the key modalities used in multi-parametric MRI is diffusion weighted MRI. Using multiple diffusion weighted MR acquisitions taken with different magnetic gradient strengths, the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) is calculated and can be used to identify tumors in the prostate. Current algorithms used to calculate ADC assume a parametric measurement model, but this assumption is not true due to the presence of additional phenomena during the acquisition process. A novel Non-parametric Estimated ADC (NEstA) algorithm is proposed which uses a Monte Carlo strategy to learn the inherent measurement distribution model based on the underlying statistical behavior of the DWI measurements to estimate the ADC values. The proposed algorithm is compared to the results of the commonly used least-squares (LS) estimation algorithm for computing ADC values. Nine test patient cases with visible tumors in the prostate gland were processed using both algorithms and compared visually. It was found that NEstA produced ADC data with reduced artifacts while preserving structure. Quantitatively, Fisher's criterion measuring the separability of the healthy prostate and tumor tissues was computed for the nine patient cases, comparing the NEstA and LS methods.

Hydroxycamptothecin (HCPT) is a DNA topoisomerase I inhibitor, which has been utilized in chemotherapy for bladder cancer for nearly 40 years. Previous research has demonstrated that the isoflavone, genistein, can sensitize multiple cancer cell lines to HCPT treatment, such as prostate and cervical cancer. In this study, we investigated whether genistein could sensitize bladder cancer cell lines and bladder epithelial cell BDEC cells to HCPT treatment, and investigated the possible underlying molecular mechanisms. Genistein could significantly and dose-dependently sensitize multiple bladder cancer cell lines and BDEC cells to HCPT-induced apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo. Genistein and HCPT synergistically inhibited bladder cell growth and proliferation, and induced G2/M phase cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in TCCSUP bladder cancer cell and BDEC cell. Pretreatment with genistein sensitized BDEC and bladder cancer cell lines to HCPT-induced DNA damage by the synergistic activation of ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase. Genistein significantly attenuated the ability of HCPT to induce activation of the anti-apoptotic NF-κB pathway both in vitro and in vivo in a bladder cancer xenograft model, and thus counteracted the anti-apoptotic effect of the NF-κB pathway.

They offer a wide range of information, entertainment, gossip, politics and economics, and often include articles on cancer. However, cancer articles in magazines have not been systematically analyzed.  Methods:   We investigated cancer-related articles and advertisements in six major Japanese weekly magazines to demonstrate trends in public interest regarding cancer.  Results:   The total number of articles assessed from July 2009 to December 2010 was 36 914, of which 696 (1.9%) were cancer articles. The total number of advertisements was 21 718, of which 340 (1.6%) were related to cancer. The number of cancer articles demonstrated an upward trend during the study period. Articles focused on lung (n = 145) and urogenital cancer (n = 122). The most common content comprised therapies and diagnosis (n = 340) and case reports on individual patients (n = 160). After a famous Japanese comedian revealed his prostate cancer diagnosis, the number of articles on prostate cancer increased from 2.0 to 6.6 per month. Immunotherapy including some dubious folk therapies was the most frequently reported cancer therapy in articles and advertisements (30.4%). A small group of oncologists were repeatedly referred to in comment sources; 35.6% of comments were presented by only five doctors.

Still, the biological basis for the pathophysiological distinction of the two disease categories has not been well documented yet. Type I NKT cells are a lymphocyte subset with important roles in regulating immune responses to either tolerance or immunity, including immune responses against bacterial pathogens. In this study, we delineate the mechanisms of NKT cell activation in periodontal infections. We show an infiltration of type I NKT cells in aggressive, but not chronic, periodontitis lesions in vivo. Murine dendritic cells infected with aggressive periodontitis-associated Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans triggered a type I IFN response followed by type I NKT cell activation. In contrast, infection with Porphyromonas gingivalis, a principal pathogen in chronic periodontitis, did not induce NKT cell activation. This difference could be explained by the absence of a type I IFN response to P. gingivalis infection. We found these IFNs to be critical for NKT cell activation.

The method has been proposed as a substitute of the prevalence/incidence ratio in the case of prostate cancer where incidence cannot be treated as a constant.

However, chemotherapy-induced immunogenic cell death (ICD) has thus far been restricted to select agents. In contrast, several chemotherapeutic drugs modulate antitumor immune responses, despite not inducing classic ICD. In addition, in many cases tumor cells do not die after treatment. Here, using docetaxel, one of the most widely used cancer chemotherapeutic agents, as a model, we examined phenotypic and functional consequences of tumor cells that do not die from ICD. Docetaxel treatment of tumor cells did not induce ATP or high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) secretion, or cell death. However, calreticulin (CRT) exposure was observed in all cell lines examined after chemotherapy treatment. Killing by carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), MUC-1, or PSA-specific CD8(+) CTLs was significantly enhanced after docetaxel treatment. This killing was associated with increases in components of antigen-processing machinery, and mediated largely by CRT membrane translocation, as determined by functional knockdown of CRT, PERK, or CRT-blocking peptide. A docetaxel-resistant cell line was selected (MDR-1(+), CD133(+)) by continuous exposure to docetaxel. These cells, while resistant to direct cytostatic effects of docetaxel, were not resistant to the chemomodulatory effects that resulted in enhancement of CTL killing. Here, we provide an operational definition of ""immunogenic modulation,"" where exposure of tumor cells to nonlethal/sublethal doses of chemotherapy alters tumor phenotype to render the tumor more sensitive to CTL killing. These observations are distinct and complementary to ICD and highlight a mechanism whereby chemotherapy can be used in combination with immunotherapy.""","""['James W Hodge', 'Charlie T Garnett', 'Benedetto Farsaci', 'Claudia Palena', 'Kwong-Yok Tsang', 'Soldano Ferrone', 'Sofia R Gameiro']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Int J Cancer""","""['Docetaxel enhances CD3+ CD56+ cytokine-induced killer cells-mediated killing through inducing tumor cells phenotype modulation.', 'Radiation-induced immunogenic modulation of tumor enhances antigen processing and calreticulin exposure, resulting in enhanced T-cell killing.', ""Sublethal exposure to alpha radiation (223Ra dichloride) enhances various carcinomas' sensitivity to lysis by antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes through calreticulin-mediated immunogenic modulation."", 'Immunogenic cell death in anticancer chemotherapy and its impact on clinical studies.', 'Molecular determinants of immunogenic cell death: surface exposure of calreticulin makes the difference.', 'Carbonic anhydrase IX inhibitor S4 triggers release of DAMPs related to immunogenic cell death in glioma cells via endoplasmic reticulum stress pathway.', 'Exploiting docetaxel-induced tumor cell necrosis with tumor targeted delivery of IL-12.', 'The Real-world Therapeutic Analysis of First-line Immunotherapy in Chinese Patients with Drive Gene Positive for Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.', 'Targeting CD70 in combination with chemotherapy to enhance the anti-tumor immune effects in non-small cell lung cancer.', 'Caspase-8 contributes to an immuno-hot microenvironment by promoting phagocytosis via an ecto-calreticulin-dependent mechanism.']"""

EP2 and EP4 siRNA knockdown resulted in reduced in vitro growth and metastasis-related gene expression (MMP9 and Runx2) of prostate cancer lines, and in vitro migration was inhibited by EP4 antagonists. As a corollary, EP3-overexpressing PC3 cells displayed impaired growth in vitro. Human prostate cancer is associated with EP4 and EP2 overexpression and reduced EP3 expression.

Here we demonstrate that telomere stability in androgen receptor (AR)-positive LNCaP human prostate cancer cells is dependent on AR and androgen, as AR inactivation by AR antagonist bicalutamide (Casodex), AR-knockdown, or androgen-depletion caused telomere dysfunction, and the effect of androgen-depletion or Casodex was blocked by the addition of androgen. Notably, neither actinomycin D nor cycloheximide blocked the DNA damage response to Casodex, indicating that the role of AR in telomere stability is independent of its role in transcription. We also demonstrate that AR is a component of telomeres, as AR-bound chromatin contains telomeric DNA, and telomeric chromatin contains AR. Importantly, AR inactivation by Casodex caused telomere aberrations, including multiple abnormal telomere signals, remindful of a fragile telomere phenotype that has been described previously to result from defective telomere DNA replication. We suggest that AR plays an important role in telomere stability and replication of telomere DNA in prostate cancer cells, and that AR inactivation-mediated telomere dysfunction may contribute to genomic instability and progression of prostate cancer cells.""","""['Junying Zhou', 'Michelle Richardson', 'Vidyavathi Reddy', 'Mani Menon', 'Evelyn R Barrack', 'G Prem-Veer Reddy', 'Sahn-Ho Kim']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Aging (Albany NY)""","""['Androgen receptor interacts with telomeric proteins in prostate cancer cells.', 'Androgen receptor signaling and vitamin D receptor action in prostate cancer cells.', 'Antagonistic interaction between bicalutamide (Casodex) and radiation in androgen-positive prostate cancer LNCaP cells.', 'Metformin represses androgen-dependent and androgen-independent prostate cancers by targeting androgen receptor.', 'Molecular genetics of human prostate cancer.', 'Hormonal regulation of telomerase activity and hTERT expression in steroid-regulated tissues and cancer.', 'Antithetic hTERT Regulation by Androgens in Prostate Cancer Cells: hTERT Inhibition Is Mediated by the ING1 and ING2 Tumor Suppressors.', 'Association between melanoma and exposure to sex hormones in puberty: A possible window of susceptibility (Review).', 'Long-Term Dynamics of Three Dimensional Telomere Profiles in Circulating Tumor Cells in High-Risk Prostate Cancer Patients Undergoing Androgen-Deprivation and Radiation Therapy.', 'Castration-resistant prostate cancer: Androgen receptor inactivation induces telomere DNA damage, and damage response inhibition leads to cell death.']"""

In this study, we evaluated expression of CCR8 and its natural cognate ligand CCL1 in patients with urothelial carcinomas of bladder and renal cell carcinomas.  Experimental design:   We examined CCR8 expression in peripheral blood and tumor tissues from patients with bladder and renal carcinomas. CCR8-positive myeloid cells were isolated from cancer tissues with magnetic beads and tested in vitro for cytokine production and ability to modulate T-cell function.  Results:   We show that monocytic and granulocytic myeloid cell subsets in peripheral blood of patients with cancer with urothelial and renal carcinomas display increased expression of chemokine receptor CCR8. Upregulated expression of CCR8 is also detected within human cancer tissues and primarily limited to tumor-associated macrophages. When isolated, CD11b(+)CCR8(+) cell subset produces the highest levels of proinflammatory and proangiogenic factors among intratumoral CD11b myeloid cells. Tumor-infiltrating CD11b(+)CCR8(+) cells selectively display activated Stat3 and are capable of inducing FoxP3 expression in autologous T lymphocytes. Primary human tumors produce substantial amounts of the natural CCR8 ligand CCL1.  Conclusions:   This study provides the first evidence that CCR8(+) myeloid cell subset is expanded in patients with cancer. Elevated secretion of CCL1 by tumors and increased presence of CCR8(+) myeloid cells in peripheral blood and cancer tissues indicate that CCL1/CCR8 axis is a component of cancer-related inflammation and may contribute to immune evasion. Obtained results also implicate that blockade of CCR8 signals may provide an attractive strategy for therapeutic intervention in human urothelial and renal cancers.""","""['Evgeniy Eruslanov', 'Taryn Stoffs', 'Wan-Ju Kim', 'Irina Daurkin', 'Scott M Gilbert', 'Li-Ming Su', 'Johannes Vieweg', 'Yehia Daaka', 'Sergei Kusmartsev']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Clin Cancer Res""","""['Chemokine Receptor-Targeted Therapies: Special Case for CCR8.', 'Recruitment and activation of macrophages by pathogenic CD4 T cells in type 1 diabetes: evidence for involvement of CCR8 and CCL1.', 'CCR8+FOXp3+ Treg cells as master drivers of immune regulation.', 'Chemokine (C-C Motif) Ligand 1 Derived from Tumor-Associated Macrophages Contributes to Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma Progression via CCR8-Mediated Akt/Proline-Rich Akt Substrate of 40 kDa/Mammalian Target of Rapamycin Pathway.', 'Chemokines and cancer: new immune checkpoints for cancer therapy.', 'Identification of AKI signatures and classification patterns in ccRCC based on machine learning.', 'A Novel Blood Proteomic Signature for Prostate Cancer.', 'Localized PD-1 Blockade in a Mouse Model of Renal Cell Carcinoma.', 'Chemokine Receptor-Targeted Therapies: Special Case for CCR8.', 'Comprehensive analysis reveals novel gene signature in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma: predicting is associated with poor prognosis in patients.']"""

Misregistration of angular coordinates during CBCT acquisition may lead to a rotated reconstructed image. If target localization is performed based on this image, an under- or over-dosage of the target volume (TV) and organs at risk (OARs) may occur. Therefore, patient CT image sets were rotated by 1° up to 3° and the treatment plans were recalculated to quantify changes in dose-volume histograms. A computer code in C++ was written to model the TV displacement and overlap area of an ellipse shape at the target and dose prescription levels corresponding to the image rotation. We investigated clinical scenarios in IGRT and ART in order to study the implications of image rotation on dose distributions for: (1) lateral TV and isocenter (SBRT), (2) central TV and isocenter (IMRT), (3) lateral TV and isocenter (IMRT). Mathematical analysis showed the dose coverage of TV depends on its shape, size, location, and orientation relative to the isocenter. Evaluation of three first scenario for θ = 1° showed variations in TV D95 in the context of IGRT and ART when compared to the original plan were within 2.7 ± 2.6% and 7.7 ± 6.9% respectively while variations in the second and third scenarios were less significant (<0.5%) for the angular range evaluated. However a larger degree of variation was found in terms of minimum and maximum doses for target and OARs. The rotation of CBCT image data sets may have significant dosimetric consequences in IGRT and ART. The TV's location relative to isocenter and shape determine the extent of alterations in dose indicators.

Results:   Of all patients, 78.0% showed acute GU toxicity, and 7.8% showed acute GI toxicity, while 63.8% showed late GU toxicity, and 21.1% showed late GI toxicity. The incidence rates of late GU and GI toxicity were significantly higher in the boost group. Multivariate analysis showed that the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) before seed implantation was a significant parameter to predict acute GU toxicity, while there were no significant predictive parameters for acute GI toxicity. On the other hand, combination with EBRT was a significant predictive parameter for late GU toxicity, and rectal volume (mL) receiving 100% of the prescribed dose (R100) was a significant predictive parameter for late GI toxicity.

We decrease the solution time of the existing linear and quadratic dose-based programming models (LP and QP, respectively) to allow optimizing over potential catheter positions using mixed integer programming. An additional average speed-up of 75% can be obtained by stopping the solver at an early stage, without deterioration of the plan quality. For a fixed catheter configuration, the dwell time optimization model LP solves to optimality in less than 15 s, which confirms earlier results. We propose an iterative procedure for QP that allows us to prescribe the target dose as an interval, while retaining independence between the solution time and the number of dose calculation points. This iterative procedure is comparable in speed to the LP model and produces better plans than the non-iterative QP. We formulate a new dose-volume-based model that maximizes V(100%) while satisfying pre-set DVH criteria. This model optimizes both catheter positions and dwell times within a few minutes depending on prostate volume and number of catheters, optimizes dwell times within 35 s and gives better DVH statistics than dose-based models.

Analysis of optimized treatment plans with carbon ions indicates that the particle number modulation of consecutive rasterspots in depth shows little variation throughout target volumes with convex shape. Thus, we extract a depth-modulation curve (DMC) from existing reference plans and adapt it for creation of new plans in similar treatment situations. The proposed method is tested with seven CT serials of prostate patients and three digital phantom datasets generated with the MATLAB code. Plans are generated with a treatment planning software developed by GSI using single-field uniform dose optimization for all the CT datasets to serve as reference plans and 'gold standard'. The adapted plans are generated based on the DMC derived from the reference plans of the same patient (intra-patient), different patient (inter-patient) and phantoms (phantom-patient). They are compared with the reference plans and a re-positioning strategy. Generally, in 1 min on a standard PC, either a physical plan or a biological plan can be generated with the adaptive method provided that the new target contour is available. In all the cases, the V95 values of the adapted plans can achieve 97% for either physical or biological plans. V107 is always 0 indicating no overdosage, and target dose homogeneity is above 0.98 in all cases. The dose received by the organs at risk is comparable to the optimized plans.

A number of small-molecule ligands have previously demonstrated the ability to stabilize G-quadruplex structures and affect gene transcription for those genes whose promoters contain a quadruplex-forming sequence. Herein, we report the probable formation of new G-quadruplex structure present in the AR promoter in a transcriptionally important location. NMR spectroscopy, circular dichroism, UV spectroscopy, and UV thermal melting experiments for this sequence are consistent with G-quadruplex formation. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) melting studies have identified a novel compound, MM45, which appears to stabilize this G-quadruplex at submicromolar concentrations. The effects of MM45 have been investigated in prostate cancer cell lines where it has been shown to inhibit cell growth. A reporter assay intended to isolate the effect of MM45 on the G-quadruplex sequence showed dose-dependent transcriptional repression only when the AR promoter G-quadruplex sequence is present. Dose-dependent transcriptional repression of the AR by MM45 has been demonstrated at both a protein and mRNA level.

Methods:   88 men who presented post-RP UI for a minimum of 1 year were enrolled prospectively. All answered the ICIQ-UISF survey and underwent urodynamic testing. Patients were divided in 3 Groups according to their urodynamic diagnosis: Group 1, patients with sphincteric incontinence (SI) alone; Group 2, patients with mixed UI (SI + Bladder Dysfunction (BD)); and Group 3, patients with BD alone. Data were analyzed using SPSS v16.0 software.  Results:   There were 51 men in Group 1 (57.9%); 30 in Group 2 (34%); and 7 (7.9%) in Group 3.

The mechanism of IBC carcinogenesis remains unknown. We sought to evaluate potential genetic risk factors for IBC and whether or not the IBC cell lines SUM149 and SUM190 demonstrated evidence of viral infection.  Methods:   We performed single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping for 2 variants of the ribonuclease (RNase) L gene that have been correlated with the risk of prostate cancer due to a possible viral etiology. We evaluated dose-response to treatment with interferon-alpha (IFN-α); and assayed for evidence of the putative human mammary tumor virus (HMTV, which has been implicated in IBC) in SUM149 cells. A bioinformatic analysis was performed to evaluate expression of RNase L in IBC and non-IBC.  Results:   2 of 2 IBC cell lines were homozygous for RNase L common missense variants 462 and 541; whereas 2 of 10 non-IBC cell lines were homozygous positive for the 462 variant (p= 0.09) and 0 of 10 non-IBC cell lines were homozygous positive for the 541 variant (p = 0.015). Our real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Southern blot analysis for sequences of HMTV revealed no evidence of the putative viral genome.  Conclusion:   We discovered 2 SNPs in the RNase L gene that were homozygously present in IBC cell lines. The 462 variant was absent in non-IBC lines. Our discovery of these SNPs present in IBC cell lines suggests a possible biomarker for risk of IBC. We found no evidence of HMTV in SUM149 cells. A query of a panel of human IBC and non-IBC samples showed no difference in RNase L expression. Further studies of the RNase L 462 and 541 variants in IBC tissues are warranted to validate our in vitro findings.""","""['Brandon T Nokes', 'Heather E Cunliffe', 'Bonnie Lafleur', 'David W Mount', 'Robert B Livingston', 'Bernard W Futscher', 'Julie E Lang']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Cancer""","""['Interferon-induced transmembrane protein 1 (IFITM1) overexpression enhances the aggressive phenotype of SUM149 inflammatory breast cancer cells in a signal transducer and activator of transcription 2 (STAT2)-dependent manner.', 'Overexpression of caveolin-1 and -2 in cell lines and in human samples of inflammatory breast cancer.', 'The effects of CEP-37440, an inhibitor of focal adhesion kinase, in vitro and in vivo on inflammatory breast cancer cells.', 'Deciphering the role of interferon alpha signaling and microenvironment crosstalk in inflammatory breast cancer.', 'Inflammatory breast cancer: New factors contribute to disease etiology: A review.', 'In vitro vascularized tumor platform for modeling tumor-vasculature interactions of inflammatory breast cancer.', 'Novel role of Engrailed 1 as a prosurvival transcription factor in basal-like breast cancer and engineering of interference peptides block its oncogenic function.', 'Distinct splice variants and pathway enrichment in the cell-line models of aggressive human breast cancer subtypes.']"""

While androgen deprivation therapy remains the primary treatment for advanced prostate cancer, resistance inevitably develops. Importantly, mounting evidence indicates that androgen receptor (AR) signaling continues to play a critical role in the growth of advanced prostate cancer despite androgen deprivation. While the mechanisms of aberrant AR activation in advanced prostate cancer have been extensively studied, the downstream AR target genes involved in the progression of castration resistance are largely unknown. Here, we identify WNT7B as a direct AR target gene highly expressed in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) cells. Our results show that expression of WNT7B is necessary for the growth of prostate cancer cells and that this effect is enhanced under androgen-deprived conditions. Further analyses reveal that WNT7B promotes androgen-independent growth of CRPC cells likely through the activation of protein kinase C isozymes. Our results also show that prostate cancer-produced WNT7B induces osteoblast differentiation in vitro through a direct cell-cell interaction, and that WNT7B is upregulated in human prostate cancer xenografts that cause an osteoblastic reaction when grown in bone. Taken together, these results suggest that AR-regulated WNT7B signaling is critical for the growth of CRPC and development of the osteoblastic bone response characteristic of advanced prostate cancer.""","""['Dali Zheng', 'Keith F Decker', 'Tianhua Zhou', 'Jianquan Chen', 'Zongtai Qi', 'Kathryn Jacobs', 'Katherine N Weilbaecher', 'Eva Corey', 'Fanxin Long', 'Li Jia']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Res""","""['Patient-derived Hormone-naive Prostate Cancer Xenograft Models Reveal Growth Factor Receptor Bound Protein 10 as an Androgen Receptor-repressed Gene Driving the Development of Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'NDRG2 acts as a negative regulator downstream of androgen receptor and inhibits the growth of androgen-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Prostate cancer bone metastases acquire resistance to androgen deprivation via WNT5A-mediated BMP-6 induction.', 'Androgen receptor-dependent and -independent mechanisms driving prostate cancer progression: Opportunities for therapeutic targeting from multiple angles.', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Modification of maternally defined H3K4me3 regulates the inviability of interspecific Xenopus hybrids.', 'The Roles of Secreted Wnt Ligands in Cancer.', 'Wnt Signaling in the Development of Bone Metastasis.', 'Inhibition of dopamine receptor D1 signaling promotes human bile duct cancer progression via WNT signaling.', 'Bioengineered BERA-Wnt5a siRNA Targeting Wnt5a/FZD2 Signaling Suppresses Advanced Prostate Cancer Tumor Growth and Enhances Enzalutamide Treatment.']"""

Objective:   The objective of the study was to analyze the relationship between KILLIN (KLLN) expression and prostate cancer and the potential tumor suppressive effect.  Design:   We conducted an in silico analysis to compare KLLN expression in normal prostate and matched primary carcinoma tissues. We subsequently used immunohistochemistry to examine KLLN expression and association with Gleason grade and score in 109 prostatectomy samples. KLLN's tumor-suppressive effect was studied in androgen-dependent and androgen-independent cell models.  Patients:   Patients were diagnosed with peripheral zone prostate carcinomas without metastasis at the time of prostatectomy. Each patient's primary tumor comprised at least 2 tumoral regions with different Gleason grades.  Results:   KLLN expression decreased from normal prostate tissue to primary carcinomas (P < .0001). The loss of epithelial and stromal KLLN expression is associated with poor differentiation and high Gleason scores (P < .0001), consistent with our in vitro observation that KLLN inhibits tumor cell proliferation and invasiveness. KLLN decreases prostate-specific antigen levels and suppresses androgen-mediated cell growth by inhibiting androgen receptor (AR) transcription. As an androgen receptor-regulated target, KLLN also functions as a transcriptional activator, directly promoting the expression of TP53 and TP73, with consequent elevated apoptosis, regardless of AR status.  Conclusions:   Our observations suggest that KLLN is a transcription factor directly regulating AR, TP53, and TP73 expression, with a role in prostate carcinogenesis. Loss of KLLN associates with high Gleason scores, suggesting that KLLN might be used as a potential prognostic marker for risk management and as a novel therapy target for advanced prostate carcinomas.""","""['Yu Wang', 'Deepa Radhakrishnan', 'Xin He', 'Donna M Peehl', 'Charis Eng']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Clin Endocrinol Metab""","""['Androgen receptor-induced tumor suppressor, KLLN, inhibits breast cancer growth and transcriptionally activates p53/p73-mediated apoptosis in breast carcinomas.', 'Neuroendocrine differentiation in usual-type prostatic adenocarcinoma: Molecular characterization and clinical significance.', 'Nuclear KLLN expression associates with improved relapse-free survival for prostate carcinoma.', 'The role of tumor suppressor dysregulation in prostate cancer progression.', 'TP73, an under-appreciated player in non-Hodgkin lymphoma pathogenesis and management.', 'LncRNA SEMA3B-AS1 inhibits breast cancer progression by targeting miR-3940/KLLN axis.', 'p53-mediated G1 arrest requires the induction of both p21 and Killin in human colon cancer cells.', 'circAMOTL1L Suppresses Renal Cell Carcinoma Growth by Modulating the miR-92a-2-5p/KLLN Pathway.', 'Identification of nuclear export signal in KLLN suggests potential role in proteasomal degradation in cancer cells.', 'Circular RNA Expression Profiles and the Pro-tumorigenic Function of CircRNA_10156 in Hepatitis B Virus-Related Liver Cancer.']"""

Materials and methods:   Between January 2004 and December 2008, a total of 1824 (M:F = 1:1.8) new patients were seen. 196 (M:F = 1:1.4) consecutive patients with histologically confirmed malignancies presenting with or having oncologic emergencies were treated and have been reviewed. Patients' folders were reviewed retrospectively with a structured pro forma. Results were analysed using Epi Info soft ware Version 3.4.1; 2007 Edition.  Results:   The median age was 49 years and mean age of 42 years (range, 15 - 82 years). M: F = 1:1.4. 162 patients had oncologic emergencies at presentation while 21 during treatments and 13 during follow up. At the time of diagnosis of oncologic emergency, 126 were not on any treatment, 42 patients on hormonal therapy and 28 patients were on diverse chemotherapy. All the patients presented late with 108 patients presenting with metastatic disease and 88 patients with locally advanced disease. Only 35 patients were treated within 1 week of onset of emergency. 59 patients had cervical cancer, 31 patients with breast cancer and 28 patients with prostate cancer. Tumour haemorrhage wass the commonest oncologic emergency seen in 107 patients followed by bone pain with imminent cord compression from bone metastases in 59 patients. Of 107 patients with tumour haemorrhage, 54 patients had cardiovascular collapse with 7 having acute renal failure. Similarly, of the 107 with tumour haemorrhage, 56 patients bled from cervical cancer, 12 patients from breast cancer and 8 patients from urinary bladder. 129 patients were treated with teletherapy, 31 patients had chemotherapy, 27 patients had emergency surgery and 5 patients had chemoradiation. Oncologic emergencies were corrected in 126 patients.  Conclusion:   Tumour haemorrhage is the commonest oncologic emergency in this environment and teletherapy is the commonest therapy used. More radiotherapy centres are needed for prompt treatment and their usefulness in managing emergencies should be made known.

Materials and methods:   This study was approved by the ethical committee. A total of 25 men with clinically suspected prostate cancer with increased prostate-specific antigen levels and at least 1 previous negative transrectal ultrasound-guided prostatic biopsy (TRUSBx) underwent diagnostic magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the prostate. Cancer suspicious regions (CSR) were identified, and MRGBx with a transgluteal approach in a large closed-bore 1.5-T MR system was manually performed in coaxial technique, using transversal fat-suppressed T2-weighted true fast imaging with steady-state free precession sequences. Success rate, biopsy findings, side effects, procedure time, number of acquisitions for the repositioning of the needle guide, and length of the biopsy channel were documented. Follow-up was performed 24 months after the procedure.  Results:   In diagnostic MR imaging of the prostate, a total of 40 CSRs were detected in 25 patients. All MRGBx procedures were technically successful and all CSRs were biopsied. The mean number of core biopsies per CSR was 3.3 ± 1.5 (range, 1-7). Histopathological analysis revealed adenocarcinoma in 35% (14/40), acute or chronic prostatitis in 30% (12/40), adenofibromyomatous changes in 22.5% (9/40), and no identifiable pathology in 17.5% (7/40) of CSRs, with a pathological overlap for chronic prostatitis and adenofibromyomatous changes in 1 patient with biopsies in 2 CSRs. No missed prostate cancer after MR-guided biopsy in clinical follow-up was detected. Mean procedure time was 31 ± 7 minutes (range, 21-46 minutes). Side effects were hematuria (n = 7), hematospermia (n = 3), combined hematuria/hematospermia (n = 2), and infection (n=1).  Conclusion:   Magnetic resonance-guided prostate biopsy of the prostate gland with a transgluteal approach is feasible, safe, and a promising technique for histological clarification of cancer suspicious lesions in patients with increased prostate-specific antigen levels after negative TRUSBx.

Methods:   In 25 patients with genitourinary RMS (15 bladder/10 prostate) the median age at diagnosis was 4 years [1-18], and 8 patients had a stage II RMS, 12 stage III and 5 stage IV. In 19/25 (12 bladder/7 prostate), radical surgery and urinary diversion were performed. Urinary diversion comprised 2 continent anal diversions, 11 continent cutaneous diversions, 4 colon conduits and 2 urethral diversions (2 + 3 years of age). In the younger child with urethral diversion, a cutaneous appendix stoma was additionally constructed in case of inability to void spontaneously.  Results:   4/19 patients who underwent radical surgery died of metastatic RMS; 1 patient with neurofibromatosis died of a secondary tumor. After median follow-up of 132 months (14-420), 14 patients currently have no evidence of disease. 8/14 patients who survived developed 17 complications requiring operative revision. All patients with a continent diversion are continent. The patients with orthotopic bladder substitution are continent day & night and void spontaneously.  Conclusion:   For RMS confined to the bladder or bladder neck, radical cystoprostatectomy and orthotopic bladder substitution are an option. Urethral diversion using the ileocecal segment (Mainz-pouch I) offers the advantage of utilizing the appendix as an additional continent cutaneous stoma, which enables parents to evacuate residual urine in young boys, until able to empty the pouch completely themselves. For all other patients with vital tumor after primary chemotherapy, cutaneous urinary diversion is an option.

The lysine specific demethylase-1 (LSD1/KDM1A), together with the JmjC domain-containing JMJD2A and JMJD2C proteins, have emerged as critical regulators of histone lysine methylation. The LSD1-JMJD2 complex functions as a transcriptional co-regulator of hormone activated androgen and estrogen receptors at specific gene promoters. LSD1 also regulates DNA methylation and p53 function. LSD1 is overexpressed in numerous cancers including prostate cancer through an unknown mechanism. We investigated expression of the LSD1 and JMJD2A in malignant human prostate specimens. We correlated LSD1 and JMJD2A expression with known mediators of prostate cancer progression: VEGF-A and cyclin A1. We show that elevated expression of LSD1, but not JMJD2A, correlates with prostate cancer recurrence and with increased VEGF-A expression. We show that functional depletion of LSD1 expression using siRNA in prostate cancer cells decreases VEGF-A and blocks androgen induced VEGF-A, PSA and Tmprss2 expression. We demonstrate that pharmacological inhibition of LSD1 reduces proliferation of both androgen dependent (LnCaP) and independent cell lines (LnCaP: C42, PC3). We show a direct mechanistic link between LSD1 over-expression and increased activity of pro-angiogenic pathways.

We report our clinical experience using the Swiss LithoClast® Master (SLM).  Materials and methods:   The SLM is a rigid, hand-held endourologic probe including a pneumatic lithotriptor and an ultrasonic lithotriptor. Attached to the ultrasonic modality is a suction system. The two lithotriptor modalities are controlled by a footswitch and can be activated separately or simultaneously. The SLM is used via a rigid endoscope. Indications for treatment were medical complaints such as hematuria, lower urinary tract symptoms, pain, recurrent urinary tract infections, recurrent bursts of balloon in indwelling catheters, and difficulties performing clean intermittent self-catheterization.  Results:   From August 1, 2009, to August 1, 2011, 27 patients were treated for bladder calculi (24 men). Five had a neurogenic voiding dysfunction, 3 had prostate cancer, and 19 had benign prostatic enlargement or detrusor muscle insufficiency. Median age was 74 years (range 45-86 years). Stone clearance was obtained in 26 (96%) patients. Stone burden was one or multiple bladder calculi. Median stone size of the largest stone in each patient was 20 (5-40) mm.

Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are involved in tumor progression and metastasis, including in prostate cancer. There is an obvious and urgent need for effective cancer stem cells specific therapies in metastatic prostate cancer. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are an important class of pervasive genes that are involved in a variety of biological functions, especially in cancer. The goal of this study was to identify miRNAs involved in prostate cancer metastasis and cancer stem cells.  Methods:   A microarray and qRT-PCR were performed to investigate the miRNA expression profiles in PC-3 sphere cells and adherent cells. A transwell assay was used to evaluate the migration of PC-3 sphere cells and adherent cells. MiR-143 was silenced with antisense oligonucleotides in PC-3, PC-3-M and LNCaP cells. The role of miR-143 in prostate cancer metastasis was measured by wound-healing and transwell assays in vitro and bioluminescence imaging in vivo. Bioinformatics and luciferase report assays were used to identify the target of miR-143.  Results:   The expression of miR-143 and the migration capability were reduced in PC-3 sphere cells and progressively increased during sphere re-adherent culture. Moreover, the down-regulation of miR-143 suppressed prostate cancer cells migration and invasion in vitro and systemically inhibited metastasis in vivo. Fibronectin type III domain containing 3B (FNDC3B), which regulates cell motility, was identified as a target of miR-143. The inhibition of miR-143 increased the expression of FNDC3B protein but not FNDC3B mRNA in vitro and vivo.  Conclusions:   These data demonstrate for the first time that miR-143 was up-regulated during the differentiation of prostate cancer stem cells and promoted prostate cancer metastasis by repressing FNDC3B expression. This sheds a new insight into the post-transcriptional regulation of cancer stem cells differentiation by miRNAs, a potential approach for the treatment of prostate cancer.""","""['Xinlan Fan', 'Xu Chen', 'Weixi Deng', 'Guangzheng Zhong', 'Qingqing Cai', 'Tianxin Lin']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['MicroRNA-195-5p, a new regulator of Fra-1, suppresses the migration and invasion of prostate cancer cells.', 'MicroRNA-132/212 Upregulation Inhibits TGF-β-Mediated Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition of Prostate Cancer Cells by Targeting SOX4.', 'Up-regulated microRNA-143 transcribed by nuclear factor kappa B enhances hepatocarcinoma metastasis by repressing fibronectin expression.', 'The potential of microRNAs as human prostate cancer biomarkers: A meta-analysis of related studies.', 'Role of miRNA-145, 148, and 185 and Stem Cells in Prostate Cancer.', 'LINC01296 promotes cancer stemness traits in oral carcinomas by sponging miR-143.', 'State-of-the-art therapeutic strategies for targeting cancer stem cells in prostate cancer.', 'Expression and prognosis analyses of the fibronectin type-III domain-containing (FNDC) protein family in human cancers: A Review.', 'Epigenetic regulation of MIR145 core promoter controls miR-143/145 cluster in bladder cancer progression and treatment outcome.', 'Signaling Pathways and Targeted Therapies for Stem Cells in Prostate Cancer.']"""

The purpose of this study was to: 1. analyze the function of miR-182-5p in prostate cancer, 2. assess its usefulness as a tumor marker, 3. identify miR-182-5p target genes in PC, 4. investigate the potential for miR-182-5p inhibitor to be used in PC treatment. Initially we found that miR-182-5p expression was significantly higher in prostate cancer tissues and cell lines compared to normal prostate tissues and cells. Moreover high miR-182-5p expression was associated with shorter overall survival in PC patients. To study the functional significance of miR-182-5p, we knocked down miR-182-5p with miR-182-5p inhibitor. After miR-182-5p knock-down, prostate cancer cell proliferation, migration and invasion were decreased. We identified FOXF2, RECK and MTSS1 as potential target genes of miR-182-5p using several algorithms which was confirmed by 3'UTR luciferase assay and Western analysis. Knock-down of miR-182-5p also significantly decreased in vivo prostate tumor growth. In conclusion this is the first report documenting that over-expression of miR-182-5p is associated with prostate cancer progression and potentially useful as a prognostic biomarker. Also knock down of miR-182-5p in order to increase expression of tumor suppressor genes FOXF2, RECK and MTSS1 may be of therapeutic benefit in prostate cancer treatment.""","""['Hiroshi Hirata', 'Koji Ueno', 'Varahram Shahryari', 'Guoren Deng', 'Yuichiro Tanaka', 'Z Laura Tabatabai', 'Yuji Hinoda', 'Rajvir Dahiya']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['MiR-374b-5p suppresses RECK expression and promotes gastric cancer cell invasion and metastasis.', 'miR-96 promotes the growth of prostate carcinoma cells by suppressing MTSS1.', 'miR-15b-5p facilitates the tumorigenicity by targeting RECK and predicts tumour recurrence in prostate cancer.', 'Prognostic DNA methylation markers for prostate cancer.', 'MTSS1: a multifunctional protein and its role in cancer invasion and metastasis.', 'Pediatric T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia blast signature and MRD associated immune environment changes defined by single cell transcriptomics analysis.', 'The emerging role of MicroRNA-182 in tumorigenesis; a promising therapeutic target.', 'DNA hypermethylation-induced miR-182 silence targets BCL2 and HOXA9 to facilitate the self-renewal of leukemia stem cell, accelerate acute myeloid leukemia progression, and determine the sensitivity of BCL2 inhibitor venetoclax.', 'Characterization of proteins, mRNAs, and miRNAs of circulating extracellular vesicles from prostate cancer patients compared to healthy subjects.', 'miRNA in Molecular Diagnostics.']"""

Functional assays can enrich stem cells based on common stem cell phenotypes, such as high ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter mediated efflux of Hoechst substrates (side population assay). This functional assay is based upon mechanisms that protect cells from environmental insult thus contributing to the survival and protection of the stem cell population. We have isolated and analyzed cells digested from twelve clinical prostate specimens based on the side population assay. Prostate stem cell properties of the isolated cells were tested by serial recombination with rat urogenital mesenchyme. Recombinants with side population cells demonstrate an increase in the frequency of human ductal growth and the number of glands per recombinant when compared to recombinants with non-side population cells. Isolated cells were capable of prostatic growth for up to three generations in the recombination assay with as little as 125 sorted prostate cells. The ability to reproducibly use cells isolated by fluorescence activated cell sorting from human prostate tissue is an essential step to a better understanding of human prostate stem cell biology. ABC transporter G2 (ABCG2) was expressed in recombinants from side population cells indicating the side population cells have self-renewal properties. Epithelial cell differentiation of recombinants was determined by immunohistochemical analysis for expression of the basal, luminal, and neuroendocrine markers, p63, androgen receptor, prostate specific antigen, and chromogranin A, respectively. Thus, the ABCG2 expressing side population demonstrates multipotency and self-renewal properties indicating stem cells are within this population.""","""['Barbara A Foster', 'Kalyan J Gangavarapu', 'Grinu Mathew', 'Gissou Azabdaftari', 'Carl D Morrison', 'Austin Miller', 'Wendy J Huss']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Aldehyde dehydrogenase and ATP binding cassette transporter G2 (ABCG2) functional assays isolate different populations of prostate stem cells where ABCG2 function selects for cells with increased stem cell activity.', 'Permissive and instructive induction of adult rodent prostatic epithelium by heterotypic urogenital sinus mesenchyme.', 'Transforming growth factor-beta(s) and their receptors in aging rat prostate.', 'Prostate stromal and urogenital sinus mesenchymal cell lines for investigations of stromal-epithelial interactions.', 'Differentiation pathways and histogenetic aspects of normal and abnormal prostatic growth: a stem cell model.', 'Redox-Regulation in Cancer Stem Cells.', 'Role of prostate stem cells and treatment strategies in benign prostate hyperplasia.', 'Prostate Luminal Progenitor Cells in Development and Cancer.', 'Prognostic role of chromogranin A in castration-resistant prostate cancer: A meta-analysis.', 'Advances in prostate cancer research models: From transgenic mice to tumor xenografting models.']"""

An unbiased data integration and interrogation strategy has not previously been available.  Methods and findings:   We implemented and performed a large meta-analysis of breast cancer gene expression profiles from 223 datasets containing 10,581 human breast cancer samples using a novel data similarity-based approach (iterative EXALT). Cancer gene expression signatures extracted from individual datasets were clustered by data similarity and consolidated into a meta-signature with a recurrent and concordant gene expression pattern. A retrospective survival analysis was performed to evaluate the predictive power of a novel meta-signature deduced from transcriptional profiling studies of human breast cancer. Validation cohorts consisting of 6,011 breast cancer patients from 21 different breast cancer datasets and 1,110 patients with other malignancies (lung and prostate cancer) were used to test the robustness of our findings. During the iterative EXALT analysis, 633 signatures were grouped by their data similarity and formed 121 signature clusters. From the 121 signature clusters, we identified a unique meta-signature (BRmet50) based on a cluster of 11 signatures sharing a phenotype related to highly aggressive breast cancer. In patients with breast cancer, there was a significant association between BRmet50 and disease outcome, and the prognostic power of BRmet50 was independent of common clinical and pathologic covariates. Furthermore, the prognostic value of BRmet50 was not specific to breast cancer, as it also predicted survival in prostate and lung cancers.  Conclusions:   We have established and implemented a novel data similarity-driven meta-analysis strategy. Using this approach, we identified a transcriptional meta-signature (BRmet50) in breast cancer, and the prognostic performance of BRmet50 was robust and applicable across a wide range of cancer-patient populations.""","""['Qingchao Qiu', 'Pengcheng Lu', 'Yuzhu Xiang', 'Yu Shyr', 'Xi Chen', 'Brian David Lehmann', 'Daniel Joseph Viox', 'Alfred L George Jr', 'Yajun Yi']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Evaluation of public cancer datasets and signatures identifies TP53 mutant signatures with robust prognostic and predictive value.', 'Prognostic meta-signature of breast cancer developed by two-stage mixture modeling of microarray data.', 'A multigene predictor of metastatic outcome in early stage hormone receptor-negative and triple-negative breast cancer.', 'Protein interaction network underpins concordant prognosis among heterogeneous breast cancer signatures.', 'Comprehensive evaluation of published gene expression prognostic signatures for biomarker-based lung cancer clinical studies.', 'Identification of a gene-expression predictor for diagnosis and personalized stratification of lupus patients.', 'A Murine Model of K-RAS and β-Catenin Induced Renal Tumors Expresses High Levels of E2F1 and Resembles Human Wilms Tumor.', 'Evaluation of public cancer datasets and signatures identifies TP53 mutant signatures with robust prognostic and predictive value.', 'SPARCL1 suppresses metastasis in prostate cancer.']"""

Taxifolin (Taxi) has been proposed to prevent cancer development similar to other dietary flavonoids. In the present study, the cytotoxic and apoptotic effects of the addition of Andro alone and Andro and Taxi together on human prostate carcinoma DU145 cells were assessed. Andro inhibited prostate cancer cell proliferation by mitotic arrest and activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. Although the effect of Taxi alone on DU145 cell proliferation was not significant, the combined use of Taxi with Andro significantly potentiated the anti-proliferative effect of increased mitotic arrest and apoptosis by enhancing the cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, and caspases-7 and -9. Andro together with Taxi enhanced microtubule polymerization in vitro, and they induced the formation of twisted and elongated spindles in the cancer cells, thus leading to mitotic arrest. In addition, we showed that depletion of MAD2, a component in the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), alleviated the mitotic block induced by the two compounds, suggesting that they trigger mitotic arrest by SAC activation. This study suggests that the anti-cancer activity of Andro can be significantly enhanced in combination with Taxi by disrupting microtubule dynamics and activating the SAC.""","""['Zhong Rong Zhang', 'Mazen Al Zaharna', 'Matthew Man-Kin Wong', 'Sung-Kay Chiu', 'Hon-Yeung Cheung']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Taxifolin synergizes Andrographolide-induced cell death by attenuation of autophagy and augmentation of caspase dependent and independent cell death in HeLa cells.', '6,7-Dimethoxy-3-(3-methoxyphenyl)isoquinolin-1-amine induces mitotic arrest and apoptotic cell death through the activation of spindle assembly checkpoint in human cervical cancer cells.', 'Andrographolide Induces Cell Cycle Arrest and Apoptosis of Chondrosarcoma by Targeting TCF-1/SOX9 Axis.', 'SRJ23, a new semisynthetic andrographolide derivative: in vitro growth inhibition and mechanisms of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in prostate cancer cells.', 'Spindle poisons and cell fate: a tale of two pathways.', 'Taxifolin and Lucidin as Potential E6 Protein Inhibitors: p53 Function Re-Establishment and Apoptosis Induction in Cervical Cancer Cells.', ""Compounds with Antiviral, Anti-Inflammatory and Anticancer Activity Identified in Wine from Hungary's Tokaj Region via High Resolution Mass Spectrometry and Bioinformatics Analyses."", 'Protective effects of taxifolin on pazopanib-induced liver toxicity: an experimental rat model.', 'Antigenotoxic Effects of Biochaga and Dihydroquercetin (Taxifolin) on H2O2-Induced DNA Damage in Human Whole Blood Cells.', 'Chemotaxonomic profiling of Penicillium setosum using high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-Q-ToF-MS).']"""

In the PSA range <4 ng ml(-1) the frequency of ERG positivity was 60.2% compared with 47.5 and 49.1% in the PSA ranges 4-10 and ≥10 ng ml(-1), respectively. In the first age quartile, ERG+ patients had lower median serum PSA and fPSA% and smaller PV. In the highest age quartile tumor volume (TV) was increased. Similar differences were observed in the low PSA range. Multivariate analysis identified the first age quartile as a predictor for ERG status (odds ratios (OR) 2.05, P=0.007). No association was found with the D'Amico progression risk score and with biochemical tumor recurrence.  Conclusions:   ERG+ tumors manifest clinically at lower PSA levels and their prevalence is age dependent. This suggests acceleration of tumor development by ERG overexpression that results in earlier tumor detection in young patients. Long-term results are warranted to determine the impact of ERG overexpression on disease outcome.""","""['G Schaefer', 'J-M Mosquera', 'R Ramoner', 'K Park', 'A Romanel', 'E Steiner', 'W Horninger', 'J Bektic', 'M Ladurner-Rennau', 'M A Rubin', 'F Demichelis', 'H Klocker']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['Prognostic Significance of TMPRSS2-ERG Fusion Gene in Prostate Cancer.', 'βIII-tubulin overexpression is an independent predictor of prostate cancer progression tightly linked to ERG fusion status and PTEN deletion.', 'ERG immunohistochemistry is not predictive for PSA recurrence, local recurrence or overall survival after radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer.', 'The prognostic and predictive value of TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion and ERG protein expression in prostate cancer biopsies.', 'The prognostic role of ERG immunopositivity in prostatic acinar adenocarcinoma: a study including 454 cases and review of the literature.', 'Metabolic pathways enriched according to ERG status are associated with biochemical recurrence in Hispanic/Latino patients with prostate cancer.', 'The evolving landscape of prostate cancer somatic mutations.', 'Prostate epithelial genes define therapy-relevant prostate cancer molecular subtype.', 'microRNA Expression Profiling in Young Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'Molecular profiling of radical prostatectomy tissue from patients with no sign of progression identifies ERG as the strongest independent predictor of recurrence.']"""

Objective:   To evaluate comparative effectiveness of alternative PSA screening strategies.  Design:   Microsimulation model of prostate cancer incidence and mortality quantifying harms and lives saved for alternative PSA screening strategies.  Data sources:   National and trial data on PSA growth, screening and biopsy patterns, incidence, treatment distributions, treatment efficacy, and mortality.  Target population:   A contemporary cohort of U.S. men.  Time horizon:   Lifetime.  Perspective:   Societal.  Intervention:   35 screening strategies that vary by start and stop ages, screening intervals, and thresholds for biopsy referral.  Outcome measures:   PSA tests, false-positive test results, cancer detected, overdiagnoses, prostate cancer deaths, lives saved, and months of life saved.  Results of base-case analysis:   Without screening, the risk for prostate cancer death is 2.86%. A reference strategy that screens men aged 50 to 74 years annually with a PSA threshold for biopsy referral of 4 µg/L reduces the risk for prostate cancer death to 2.15%, with risk for overdiagnosis of 3.3%. A strategy that uses higher PSA thresholds for biopsy referral in older men achieves a similar risk for prostate cancer death (2.23%) but reduces the risk for overdiagnosis to 2.3%. A strategy that screens biennially with longer screening intervals for men with low PSA levels achieves similar risks for prostate cancer death (2.27%) and overdiagnosis (2.4%), but reduces total tests by 59% and false-positive results by 50%.  Results of sensitivity analysis:   Varying incidence inputs or reducing the survival improvement due to screening did not change conclusions.  Limitation:   The model is a simplification of the natural history of prostate cancer, and improvement in survival due to screening is uncertain.  Conclusion:   Compared with standard screening, PSA screening strategies that use higher thresholds for biopsy referral for older men and that screen men with low PSA levels less frequently can reduce harms while preserving lives.

However, most optimization schemes use aperture optimization, where it is not so clear how to apply ILS. This study therefore proposes a method of using ILS for aperture optimization in volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) and evaluates the performance by comparing with segment weight optimization. The AutoBeam inverse treatment planning system was used to optimize fluence, sequence the fluence into deliverable apertures and then optimize these apertures and their accompanying segment weights. ILS was used for both the fluence and aperture optimization stages. In the aperture optimization, if the dose beyond a multileaf collimator (MLC) leaf was too high, that leaf was closed up slightly, and if the dose underneath a leaf was too low, that leaf was opened up slightly. To evaluate this heuristic, five prostate and pelvic nodes patients were retrospectively planned. To evaluate the performance of the aperture optimization, these plans were compared to those produced using segment weight optimization alone after sequencing. Sinograms showing effective monitor units delivered by MLC leaf pairs over the course of beam delivery were used to elucidate the comparison. It was found that aperture optimization with ILS produced treatment plans which were conformal, with dose deposition easily controlled by a few clinical objectives. Sinogram analysis showed that aperture optimization with ILS produced less leaf motion and less monitor unit variation between control points than when using segment weight optimization only. By converting fluence corrections to aperture shape corrections, ILS can be used as a powerful method for VMAT aperture optimization. Sinogram analysis provides a clear insight into the behaviour of the heuristic.""","""['James L Bedford']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Treatment planning for volumetric modulated arc therapy.', 'Continuous aperture dose calculation and optimization for volumetric modulated arc therapy.', 'Volumetric modulated arc therapy: IMRT in a single gantry arc.', 'Comparison of anatomy-based, fluence-based and aperture-based treatment planning approaches for VMAT.', 'Aperture shape optimization for IMRT treatment planning.', 'A recurrent neural network for rapid detection of delivery errors during real-time portal dosimetry.', 'Optimisation of a composite difference metric for prompt error detection in real-time portal dosimetry of simulated volumetric modulated arc therapy.', 'Dosimetric accuracy of dynamic couch rotation during volumetric modulated arc therapy (DCR-VMAT) for primary brain tumours.', 'Dose prescription with spatial uncertainty for peripheral lung SBRT.', 'Direct aperture optimization using an inverse form of back-projection.']"""

PRMT6 has been known to be responsible for asymmetric dimethylation of histone H3 at R2 (H3R2me2a). To investigate the biological role of PRMT6, we first established stable cell lines expressing GFP-PRMT6 with MCF7 and PC3 cells. Growth rates and colony forming abilities of PRMT6-overexpressing cells were significantly retarded compared to control GFP expressing cells. This growth retardation seems to be associated with p21(WAF1) induction. In addition, our data show that migration and invasion of prostate cancer cells was strongly suppressed by PRMT6 overexpression. In parallel, the levels of thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1), a potent natural inhibitor of angiogenesis, were highly up-regulated in both PRMT6-overexpressing cells. Furthermore, this suppression of migration and invasion by PRMT6 overexpression was significantly rescued by specific knock-down of TSP-1. Concomitantly, down-regulations of MMP-2 and -9 were observed in PRMT6-overexpressing cells.

Activation of PKCα, PKCβII and PKCε by GnRH is relatively transient in αT3-1 and LβT2 gonadotrope cell lines and more prolonged in LNCaP and DU-145 cell lines. On the otherhand, the activation and re-distribution of the above PKCs by PMA was similar for both gonadotrope cell lines and prostate cancer cell lines. Activation of ERK1/2 by GnRH and PMA was robust in the gonadotrope cell lines, with a smaller effect observed in the prostate cancer cell lines. The Ca(2+) ionophore A23187 stimulated ERK1/2 in gonadotrope cell lines but not in prostate cancer cell lines. GnRH, PMA and A23187 stimulated JNK activity in gonadotrope cell lines, with a more sustained effect in prostate cancer cell lines. Sustained activation of p38 was observed for PMA and A23187 in Du-145 cells, while p38 activation by GnRH, PMA and A23187 in LβT2 cells was transient. Thus, differential expression and re-distribution of PKCs by GnRH and the transient vs. the more sustained nature of the activation of the PKC-MAPK cascade by GnRH in gonadotrope cell lines vs. prostate cancer cell lines respectively, may provide the mechanistic basis for the cell context-dependent differential biological responses observed in GnRH interaction with pituitary gonadotropes vs. prostate cancer cells.""","""['Ludmila Sviridonov', 'Masha Dobkin-Bekman', 'Boris Shterntal', 'Fiorenza Przedecki', 'Linor Formishell', 'Shani Kravchook', 'Liat Rahamim-Ben Navi', 'Tali Hana Bar-Lev', 'Marcelo G Kazanietz', 'Zhong Yao', 'Rony Seger', 'Zvi Naor']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Mol Cell Endocrinol""","""['Differential roles of PKC isoforms (PKCs) in GnRH stimulation of MAPK phosphorylation in gonadotrope derived cells.', 'Differential roles of PKC isoforms (PKCs) and Ca2+ in GnRH and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) stimulation of p38MAPK phosphorylation in immortalized gonadotrope cells.', 'Differential role of PKC isoforms in GnRH and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase and Jun N-terminal kinase.', 'Signaling by G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR): studies on the GnRH receptor.', 'Intracellular signaling pathways mediated by the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor.', 'Dissecting the Hormonal Signaling Landscape in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone Receptors in Prostate Cancer: Molecular Aspects and Biological Functions.', 'Discovery of Novel Non-Steroidal Cytochrome P450 17A1 Inhibitors as Potential Prostate Cancer Agents.', 'Identifying New Candidate Genes and Chemicals Related to Prostate Cancer Using a Hybrid Network and Shortest Path Approach.', 'In search of the molecular mechanisms mediating the inhibitory effect of the GnRH antagonist degarelix on human prostate cell growth.']"""

Methods and materials:   Subjects were 50 men with intermediate-risk prostate cancer treated with (125)I brachytherapy in a prospective phase II clinical trial. On Day 30 after the implantation, dosimetry was evaluated in the prostate base, midgland, and apex regions on fused MRI-CT scans and CT scans. Volumes of each sector receiving 100% of the prescribed dose (V100) and doses to 90% of each sector (D90) were also calculated on the ultrasonogram used for treatment planning and compared with values derived from CT and fused MRI-CT scans.  Results:   Fused MRI-CT scans revealed lower-than-expected doses for the whole prostate (V100=91.3%, D90=152.9Gy) compared with CT scans (98.5% and 183.6Gy, p<0.0001) and lower doses to the prostate base (V100=79%, D90=130Gy) vs. CT (96% and 170Gy, p<0.0001). However, lower doses to the prostate base did not adversely affect biochemical outcomes in men with biopsy-proven disease at the base. At a median followup time of 42 months, the mean prostate-specific antigen level for all patients was 0.3ng/mL, and no patient had experienced biochemical or clinical progression or recurrence.  Conclusions:   MRI-CT fusion-based sector analysis was feasible and revealed significantly lower doses to the prostate base than doses estimated from CT alone, although this did not affect biochemical outcomes.

We evaluated the outcomes of intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and HDR boost in a community setting.  Methods and materials:   Between July 2003 and April 2008, 148 patients with prostate cancer were treated at Cancer Center of Irvine using two transperineal implants performed 1 week apart (22Gy delivered in four fractions divided between two insertions and delivered twice daily), followed by IMRT (50.4Gy). Hormonal therapy was given for 1 year to all patients with Gleason score of 8 or higher.  Results:   Patient characteristics are as follows: median age at treatment, 71 years; American Joint Committee on Cancer Group IIB, 53%; Gleason score of 7, 41%; and Gleason score of 8 or higher, 14%. Median followup was 49 months, and median prostate-specific antigen (PSA) nadir was 0.15ng/mL. The 4-year actuarial biochemical disease-free survival (bDFS) was 96.8/81% by Phoenix/PSA lower than 0.5ng/mL criteria. According to National Comprehensive Cancer Center Clinical Practice Guidelines-defined recurrence risk groups, 4-year bDFS for low risk was 100/92.9%, intermediate risk was 100/86.7%, and high risk was 94/75.4% by Phoenix/PSA lower than 0.5ng/mL criteria. No statistically significant difference in bDFS was detected by either failure criteria based on risk group, lymph node risk, or initial PSA. Treatment was well tolerated. Subacute/late genitourinary and gastrointestinal toxicities were limited to 10% and 5%, respectively of all patients.  Conclusions:   Prostate IMRT plus HDR brachytherapy boost was well tolerated with appropriate PSA response and bDFS at 4 years, demonstrated in a community setting.

CRPC is androgen-depletion resistant but androgen receptor (AR) dependent. AR is a nuclear receptor whose transcriptional activity is regulated by hormone binding to the ligand-binding domain (LBD). Constitutively active AR splice variants that lack LBDs often are expressed in CRPC. The expression of these variants indicates that methods to inhibit AR activity that do not rely on inactivating the LBD are needed. Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90), a potential therapeutic target in PCa, is an AR chaperone crucial for proper folding, hormone binding and transcriptional activity of AR. We generated LNCaP cell lines with regulated expression of the AR-V7 variant as well as a cell line expressing artificially truncated AR (termed AR-NTD) to characterize splice variant function. Using an Hsp90 inhibitor, Geldanamycin (GA), and an AR-Hsp90-FKBP52 specific inhibitor, MJC13, we sought to determine if the AR variants also require Hsp90 and associated co-chaperone, FKBP52, for their activity.

Methods:   Consecutive patients undergoing radical cystoprostatectomy for bladder malignancy at six academic institutions were assessed. End-points were the histological diagnosis of prostate cancer in the radical cystoprostatectomy specimens and mortality. The association between incidental prostate cancer and mortality was calculated by multivariable Cox regression, and the association between age and the occurrence of prostate cancer was calculated by logistic regression.  Results:   A total of 1122 patients (aged 65.6 ± 10 years) were included in this analysis. Prostate cancer was detected in 17.8% (n = 200) of the cystoprostatectomy specimens. After multivariable adjustment, prostate cancer was significantly associated with mortality (hazard ratio 1.27, 95% confidence interval 1.03-1.56). There was a significant association between age and the presence of prostate cancer in the cystoprostatectomy specimen. The odds ratio for the presence of prostate cancer was 1.028 (95% confidence interval 1.011-1.045; P < 0.001) per each year after the age of 40 years.  Conclusions:   Concomitant prostate cancer is an independent prognostic factor for mortality after radical cystoprostatectomy for bladder cancer. When considering a prostate-sparing technique, urologists should consider that every fifth to sixth patient will present with a concomitant prostate cancer, and that after the age of 40 years, the odds of a concomitant prostate cancer increases by 2.8% per year, thus warranting a careful balance between the oncological risks and quality of life issues.""","""['Stephan Buse', 'Thomas Höfner', 'Stephan C Müller', 'Edwin Hermann', 'Wolf F Wieland', 'Matthias May', 'Christian G Stief', 'Patrick J Bastian', 'Markus Hohenfellner', 'Axel Haferkamp']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Int J Urol""","""['Editorial comment to characterization and risk stratification of prostate cancer in patients undergoing radical cystoprostatectomy.', 'The prognostic impact of incidental prostate cancer following radical cystoprostatectomy: a nationwide analysis.', 'Editorial comment to characterization and risk stratification of prostate cancer in patients undergoing radical cystoprostatectomy.', 'Incidental prostate cancer in Asian men: high prevalence of incidental prostatic adenocarcinoma in Chinese patients undergoing radical cystoprostatectomy for treatment of bladder cancer and selection of candidates for prostate-sparing cystectomy.', 'Concomitant pathology in the prostate in cystoprostatectomy specimens: a prospective study and review.', 'Do we use the right criteria for determining the clinical significance of incidental prostate cancer at radical cystoprostatectomy?', 'Assessment of 5-year overall survival in bladder cancer patients with incidental prostate cancer identified at radical cystoprostatectomy.', 'Prostate cancer incidentally discovered at the time of radical cystoprostatectomy does not decrease overall survival: Results from a large Chinese medical center.', 'Concomitant bladder cancer and prostate cancer: challenges and controversies.', 'Concomitant Gleason Score ≥ 7 prostate cancer is an independent prognosticator for poor survival in nonmetastatic bladder cancer patients undergoing radical cystoprostatectomy.', 'Oncologic aspects of long-term followed incidental prostate cancer detected by cystoprostatectomy in Korean patients.']"""

It was shown that BLM selectively targeted MCF-7 human breast carcinoma cells but not the ""normal"" breast cell line MCF-10A. Furthermore, it was found that the BLM analogue deglycobleomycin, which lacks the disaccharide moiety of BLM, did not target either cell line, indicating that the BLM disaccharide moiety is necessary for tumor selectivity. Not resolved in the earlier study were the issues of whether the BLM disaccharide moiety alone is sufficient for tumor cell targeting and the possible cellular uptake of the disaccharide. In the present study, we conjugated BLM, deglycoBLM, and BLM disaccharide to the cyanine dye Cy5**. It was found that the BLM and BLM disaccharide conjugates, but not the deglycoBLM conjugate, bound selectively to MCF-7 cells and were internalized. The same was also true for the prostate cancer cell line DU-145 (but not for normal PZ-HPV-7 prostate cells) and for the pancreatic cancer cell line BxPC-3 (but not for normal SVR A221a pancreas cells). The targeting efficiency of the disaccharide was only slightly less than that of BLM in MCF-7 and DU-145 cells and comparable to that of BLM in BxPC-3 cells.

AND WHAT DOES THE STUDY ADD?: Systems for image guidance during laparoscopic surgery can be broadly defined as systems that enable the surgeon to refer to preoperatively gathered information during the procedure. For a laparoscopic system the preoperative information can be overlaid onto the laparoscopic video screen. Examples of surgical image-guidance systems and the results of early testing are not uncommon but the technical methodologies used vary widely as do the visualisation methods. This study reports our experience of using an image-guidance system on 13 patients. Furthermore, we use previously proposed methodology to form a development and evaluation framework specific to image-guided laparoscopic radical prostatectomy. Finally, we propose that if the system development process is properly designed, it should be possible to correlate system technical parameters with clinical outcomes. We present a possible plot for the key technical parameter of accuracy. Better understanding of this correlation should enable robust development and evaluation of surgical image-guidance systems to optimise patient outcomes.  Objective:   To implement and test the feasibility of an image-guidance system for robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP). Laparoscopic surgical outcomes may be improved through image guidance. However, to demonstrate improved outcomes rigorous evaluation techniques are required. Therefore we also present our work in establishing robust evaluation techniques.  Patients and methods:   Development work used three cadavers and an anatomy phantom. The system has been used on 13 patients. During surgery the surgeon can refer to the patient's magnetic resonance imaging (collected before the operation) overlaid on the endoscopic video image. The result of the overlay process was measured qualitatively by the surgeon with reference to the desired clinical outcomes.  Results:   The use of the overlay system has not resulted in any measurable change in clinical outcomes. The surgeons found the system to be a useful tool for reference during surgery. A more rigorous evaluation method is proposed that will enable on-going development.  Conclusion:   Image guidance during RARP is feasible. We propose a series of measures that will improve further development and evaluation.""","""['Stephen Thompson', 'Graeme Penney', 'Michele Billia', 'Ben Challacombe', 'David Hawkes', 'Prokar Dasgupta']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Intraoperative registered transrectal ultrasound guidance for robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.', 'Anatomical dimensions using preoperative magnetic resonance imaging: impact on the learning curve of robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy.', 'Evolution of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Evaluation of a marker-less, intra-operative, augmented reality guidance system for robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.', 'Systematic review and meta-analysis of studies reporting urinary continence recovery after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Virtual reality tumor navigated robotic radical prostatectomy by using three-dimensional reconstructed multiparametric prostate MRI and 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT images: A useful tool to guide the robotic surgery?', 'The evolution of image guidance in robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP): a glimpse into the future.', '3D imaging applications for robotic urologic surgery: an ESUT YAUWP review.']"""

However, there are significant differences in circadian rhythm between different tumors. At present, the circadian rhythm characteristics of oral cancer remain unknown. The purpose of this study is to investigate the circadian rhythm characteristics of the in vivo growth of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC).  Materials and methods:   Thirty-two nude mice were placed under 12-hour light/12-hour dark cycles. The human OSCC cell line BcaCD885 was inoculated in the cheek of nude mice. After 3 weeks, eight mice were sacrificed at four time points, including 4 hours after light onset (HALO), 10 HALO, 16 HALO, and 22 HALO, during a period of 24 hours. The volume of excised tumors was measured and the proliferative index (PI) and apoptotic index (AI) of tumor cells were determined by flow cytometry. A cosine analysis method was used to determine whether the tumor volume, PI, and AI obeyed a circadian rhythm.  Results:   There was a significant circadian rhythm in the tumor volume and PI of OSCC cells. For the tumor volume, there were significant differences between the four time points. The peak and trough values of the tumor volume appeared at 3.23 HALO and 15.23 HALO, whereas the peak and trough values of PI appeared at 6.60 HALO and 18.16 HALO, respectively. However, there was no circadian rhythm in the AI of tumor cells, despite significant differences between the four time points.  Conclusion:   This study demonstrates, for the first time, that the tumor volume and PI of in vivo growing OSCC undergo circadian rhythms. These results support the assertion that time factor should be considered in the occurrence, development, treatment, efficacy evaluation and pathophysiology of OSCC.""","""['Ningbo Zhao', 'Hong Tang', 'Kai Yang', 'Dan Chen']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Onco Targets Ther""","""['The drug efficacy and adverse reactions in a mouse model of oral squamous cell carcinoma treated with oxaliplatin at different time points during a day.', 'Chronchemotherapy of oxaliplatin to oral squamous cell carcinoma.', 'Circadian rhythm variation of the clock genes Per1 and cell cycle related genes in different stages of carcinogenesis of buccal mucosa in animal model.', 'Circadian rhythms of DNA synthesis and apoptosis correlated gene expression in bone marrow cells of nude mice bearing human nasopharyngeal carcinoma.', 'Circadian variation of 5-fluorouracil catabolism in isolated perfused rat liver.', 'Expression Profile of Circular RNAs in Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma.', 'The role of circadian clock genes in tumors.', 'Circadian clock and oral cancer.', 'The drug efficacy and adverse reactions in a mouse model of oral squamous cell carcinoma treated with oxaliplatin at different time points during a day.']"""

The aim of this study was to identify novel and effective molecular markers in this chromosomal region for PCa. The differentially expressed genes in PCa specimens were screened by gene microarray analysis, which was validated by RT-QPCR analysis. Then, the DNA qPCR analysis was carried out to detect the copy number changes of these differentially expressed genes. Moreover, the clinical significance of candidate markers (MYC and E2F5) in PCa were further determined. E2F5 and MYC were identified as candidate markers in PCa tissues and PCa cell lines. The DNA qPCR revealed the significant copy number gains of E2F5 and MYC in PCa tissues but not in PCa cell lines. In addition, Western blot analysis and immunohistochemical staining both found the significant higher expression of E2F5 and MYC proteins in PCa tissues than those in adjacent benign specimens (all P < 0.01). Moreover, the overexpression of E2F5 protein was significantly associated with a high Gleason score (P < 0.01), an advanced clinical stage (P = 0.01), a positive metastasis (P < 0.01) and PSA Failure (P < 0.01). The overexpression of MYC was more frequently found in PCa tissues with positive metastasis (P = 0.02) and PSA failure (P = 0.02).

Methods:   This was a prospective study including patients for staging (S) and restaging (R). Seventy-two patients (23S, 49R) with infiltrating ductal breast carcinoma, 49 patients (25S, 24R) with prostate adenocarcinoma and 30 patients (17S, 13R) with non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), without known bone metastases but with high risk/clinical suspicion for the same, underwent a (99m)Tc-MDP bone scan, FDG PET/CT and (18)F-fluoride PET/CT within 2 weeks. All scans were reviewed by two experienced nuclear medicine physicians, and the findings were correlated with MRI/thin-slice CT/skeletal survey. Histological verification was done wherever feasible.  Results:   Sensitivity and negative predictive value (NPV) of (18)F-fluoride PET/CT was 100 % in all three malignancies, while that of FDG PET/CT was 79 % and 73 % in NSCLC, 73 % and 80 % in breast cancer and 72 and 65 % in prostate cancer. Specificity and positive predictive value (PPV) of FDG PET/CT were 100 % in NSCLC and prostate and 97 % and 96 % in breast cancer. As compared to the (99m)Tc-MDP bone scan, all parameters were superior for (18)F-fluoride PET/CT in prostate and breast cancer, but sensitivity and NPV were equal in NSCLC. The MDP bone scan had superior sensitivity and NPV compared to FDG PET/CT but had low specificity and PPV.  Conclusion:   To rule out bone metastases in cases where there is a high index of suspicion, (18)F-fluoride PET/CT is the most reliable investigation.

Methods:   T2-weighted imaging, DWI and dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) were performed with a 3-T magnet in 262 patients after RP. Twenty out of 262 patients evaluated were excluded. MRI results were validated by prostate-specific antigen (PSA) reduction after external beam radiotherapy in group A (126 patients, local recurrence size range 4-8 mm) and by transrectal ultrasound biopsy in group B (116 patients, local recurrence size range 9-15 mm).  Results:   In group A combined T2-weighted and DCE-MRI (T2+DCE) shows 98 % sensitivity, 94 % specificity and 93 % accuracy in identifying local recurrence; combined T2-weighted and DWI with a b value of 3,000 s/mm(2) (T2+DW3) displays 97 % sensitivity, 95 % specificity and 92 % accuracy, while with a b value of 1,000 s/mm(2) (T2+DW1) affords 93 % sensitivity, 89 % specificity and 88 % accuracy.

Conclusion:   DCE-MRI is the most reliable technique in detecting local prostate cancer recurrence after RP, though DWI can be proposed as a reliable alternative.  Key points:   • Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI-MRI) is being increasingly used in oncology. • PSA analysis does not distinguish prostate cancer recurrence from distant metastasis. • DWI-MR can diagnose local prostate cancer recurrence after radical prostatectomy. • DWI-MR is almost comparable to DCE-MRI in detecting local recurrence.""","""['Valeria Panebianco', 'Flavio Barchetti', 'Alessandro Sciarra', 'Daniela Musio', 'Valerio Forte', 'Vincenzo Gentile', 'Vincenzo Tombolini', 'Carlo Catalano']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Eur Radiol""","""['Re: prostate cancer recurrence after radical prostatectomy: the role of 3-T diffusion imaging in multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging.', 'Comparative sensitivities of functional MRI sequences in detection of local recurrence of prostate carcinoma after radical prostatectomy or external-beam radiotherapy.', 'Detection of Local Recurrence of Prostate Cancer After Radical Prostatectomy Using Endorectal Coil MRI at 3 T: Addition of DWI and Dynamic Contrast Enhancement to T2-Weighted MRI.', 'Multiparametric 3T MRI for the prediction of pathological downgrading after radical prostatectomy in patients with biopsy-proven Gleason score 3\u2009+\u20094 prostate cancer.', 'The diagnostic accuracy and cost-effectiveness of magnetic resonance spectroscopy and enhanced magnetic resonance imaging techniques in aiding the localisation of prostate abnormalities for biopsy: a systematic review and economic evaluation.', 'Role of magnetic resonance imaging in the detection of local prostate cancer recurrence after external beam radiotherapy and radical prostatectomy.', 'Role of magnetic resonance imaging for preoperative prediction of early biochemical failure in localized prostate cancer.', 'Clinical Application of the New Prostate Imaging for Recurrence Reporting (PI-RR) Score Proposed to Evaluate the Local Recurrence of Prostate Cancer after Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Diagnostic yield of multiparametric MRI for local recurrence at biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy.', 'Reirradiation of Locally Recurrent Prostate Cancer with Cyberknife® System or Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy (VMAT) and IGRT-Clarity®: Outcomes, Toxicities and Dosimetric Evaluation.', 'The role of MRI in prostate cancer: current and future directions.']"""

Non-invasive biomarkers that can facilitate the detection and monitoring of bone metastases are highly desirable. We designed this study to assess the expression patterns of serum miR-141 in patients with bone-metastatic PCa. Serum samples were collected to measure the miR-141 level in 56 patients, including six with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), 20 with localized PCa and 30 with bone-metastatic PCa (10 with hormone-naive PCa, 10 with hormone-sensitive PCa and 10 with hormone-refractory PCa). A bone scan was performed for each patient with PCa to assess the number of bone lesions. The quantification of serum miR-141 levels was assayed by specific TaqMan qRT-PCR. The results showed that serum miR-141 levels were elevated in patients with bone metastasis (P<0.001). There was no statistically significant difference in the serum miR-141 levels between patients with BPH and patients with localized PCa. Using Kendall's bivariate correlation test, both the Gleason score and the number of bone-metastatic lesions were found to correlate with serum miR-141 levels (P=0.012 and P<0.001, respectively). The serum miR-141 level was found to be positively correlated with alkaline phosphatase (ALP) level in patients with skeletal metastasis, using Pearson's bivariate correlation test. No relationship was found between the serum miR-141 level and the serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level.

However, he had been treated for metastatic prostate cancer, to the pelvis and roof of the left acetabulum, with androgen ablation, and radiotherapy 5 years before presentation. Examination of the left hip revealed painful movements, but no restriction in the range of motion. Initial X-rays did not show any abnormalities, but MRI scan revealed a suspicious lesion in the roof of the left acetabulum, with no indication of secondary weakening of the femoral neck. The patient was therefore referred to the oncologists to consider radiotherapy, but they were not convinced it was metastatic, because he had no new urinary symptoms, and the PSA remained normal throughout this period. He was subsequently referred for a bone scan to look for possible secondary lesions (from the prostate gland), but this did not reveal any abnormal increased uptake. Three months later, he was reviewed in the clinic with a repeat X-ray of the pelvis which revealed complete destruction of the left femoral head and the acetabular roof, but CT-guided biopsy revealed no evidence of malignancy in the left hip. However, in view of the persistent pain and radiological evidence of left hip destruction, the patient had left Total Hip Replacement (THR), and excellent post-operative recovery. He mobilised fully, and was discharged on day five. Histology of the femoral head and hip capsule, revealed no evidence of metastasis from the prostate cancer, but confirmed osteonecrosis of the femoral head, presumably caused by the previous radiotherapy.

Reports have indicated that atherosclerosis and cancers my share common pathoetiologic and pathogenetic cascades. If atherosclerosis and cancers have common pathoetiologic and pathogenetic cascades, both diseases will co-occur and patients may represent a potential target group for cancer screening interventions.  Materials and methods:   Prostates and coronary vessels were examined from 37 deceased men, aged 50 years and older, who died unexpectedly and suddenly from traumatic causes. Tissue sections of the entire prostate were examined for benign and malignant lesions.

Genome-wide association studies have identified genetic variants associated with 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] status. We examined prostate cancer risk in relation to single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in four genes shown to predict circulating levels of 25(OH)D.

Logistic regression was used to estimate the individual and cumulative association between genetic variants and risk of overall and aggressive prostate cancer.  Results:   We observed a decreased risk of aggressive prostate cancer among men with the allele in rs6013897 near CYP24A1 associated with lower serum 25(OH)D [per A allele, OR, 0.86; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.80-0.93; Ptrend = 0.0002) but an increased risk for nonaggressive disease (per A allele: OR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.04-1.17; Ptrend = 0.002).

In this study, we found that the expression of DLC1 (deleted in liver cancer 1) tumor-suppressor gene in metastatic prostate carcinoma (PCA) cells increased the expression of E-cadherin and resulted in an elevated rate of cell-cell aggregation as measured by aggregation assay. DLC1-mediated increase in E-cadherin expression was not dependent on α-catenin, a DLC1-binding protein associated with E-cadherin, and/or cellular density. The increase of E-cadherin expression occurred at mRNA level and relied on DLC1 RhoGAP function, leading to suppression of high level of RhoA-GTP and RhoC-GTP activity in metastatic PCA cells. Application of Rho/ROCK inhibitors produced the same effect as introduction of DLC1. Knocking down of RhoA produced a moderate increase in E-cadherin whereas knocking down of RhoC resulted in a significant increase of E-cadherin. Downregulation of E-cadherin caused by constitutively active RhoA(V14) and RhoC(V14) could not be reversed by expression of DLC1 in DLC1-negative cell line. DLC1-mediated suppression of metastatic PCA cells invasion was comparable with the one associated with ectopic E-cadherin expression, or caused by suppression of Rho pathway either by Rho/ROCK inhibitors, or by shRNA repression. This study demonstrates that DLC1 expression positively regulates E-cadherin and suppresses highly metastatic PCA cell invasion by modulating Rho pathway, which appears as a feasible therapeutic target in cancers with high activity of RhoGTPases.""","""['V Tripathi', 'N C Popescu', 'D B Zimonjic']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['Rho GTPase-activating protein deleted in liver cancer suppresses cell proliferation and invasion in hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'Deleted in liver cancer 1 (DLC1) negatively regulates Rho/ROCK/MLC pathway in hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'DLC1 interaction with α-catenin stabilizes adherens junctions and enhances DLC1 antioncogenic activity.', 'GAP-independent functions of DLC1 in metastasis.', 'Regulation of deleted in liver cancer 1 tumor suppressor by protein-protein interactions and phosphorylation.', 'Deleted in liver cancer 1 suppresses the growth of prostate cancer cells through inhibiting Rho-associated protein kinase pathway.', 'Evaluation of the causal relationship between smoking and schizophrenia in East Asia.', 'Role of RhoC in cancer cell migration.', 'Mutational drivers of cancer cell migration and invasion.', 'Nuclear DLC1 exerts oncogenic function through association with FOXK1 for cooperative activation of MMP9 expression in melanoma.']"""

A 2-stage genome-wide association study was performed with the primary end point of change in AUA Symptom Score from baseline at each of 4 followup periods. Single nucleotide polymorphism associations were assessed using multivariable linear regression adjusting for pre-radiotherapy AUA Symptom Score severity category and clinical variables. Fisher's trend method was used to calculate combined p values from the discovery and replication cohorts.  Results:   A region on chromosome 9p21.2 containing 8 single nucleotide polymorphisms showed the strongest association with change in AUA Symptom Score (combined p values 8.8×10(-6) to 6.5×10(-7) at 2 to 3 years after radiotherapy). These single nucleotide polymorphisms form a haplotype block that encompasses the inflammation signaling gene IFNK. These single nucleotide polymorphisms were independently associated with change in AUA Symptom Score after adjusting for clinical predictors including smoking history, hypertension, α-blocker use and pre-radiotherapy AUA Symptom Score. An additional 24 single nucleotide polymorphisms showed moderate significance for association with change in AUA Symptom Score. Several of these single nucleotide polymorphisms were more strongly associated with change in specific AUA Symptom Score items, including rs13035033 in the MYO3B gene, which was associated with straining (beta coefficient 0.9, 95% CI 0.6-1.2, p = 5.0×10(-9)).

Methods:   We analyzed levels of SPDEF messenger RNA and protein in more than 500 human CRC samples and more than 80 nontumor controls. Spdef(-/-)and wild-type mice (controls) were either bred with Apc(Min/+) mice, or given azoxymethane (AOM) and dextran sodium sulfate (DSS), or 1,2-dimethylhydrazine and DSS, to induce colorectal tumors. Expression of Spdef also was induced transiently by administration of tetracycline to Spdef(dox-intestine) mice with established tumors, induced by the combination of AOM and DSS or by breeding with Apc(Min/+) mice. Colon tissues were collected and analyzed for tumor number, size, grade, and for cell proliferation and apoptosis. We also analyzed the effects of SPDEF expression in HCT116 and SW480 human CRC cells.  Results:   In colorectal tumors from patients, loss of SPDEF was observed in approximately 85% of tumors and correlated with progression from normal tissue, to adenoma, to adenocarcinoma. Spdef(-/-); Apc(Min/+) mice developed approximately 3-fold more colon tumors than Spdef(+/+); Apc(Min/+) mice. Likewise, Spdef(-/-) mice developed approximately 3-fold more colon tumors than Spdef(+/+) mice after administration of AOM and DSS. After administration of 1,2-dimethylhydrazine and DSS, invasive carcinomas were observed exclusively in Spdef(-/-) mice. Conversely, expression of SPDEF was sufficient to promote cell-cycle exit in cells of established adenomas from Spdef(dox-intestine); Apc(Min/+) mice and in Spdef(dox-intestine) mice after administration of AOM + DSS. SPDEF inhibited the expression of β-catenin-target genes in mouse colon tumors, and interacted with β-catenin to block its transcriptional activity in CRC cell lines, resulting in lower levels of cyclin D1 and c-MYC.  Conclusions:   SPDEF is a colon tumor suppressor and a candidate therapeutic target for colon adenomas and adenocarcinoma.""","""['Taeko K Noah', 'Yuan-Hung Lo', 'Allison Price', 'Gang Chen', 'Eileen King', 'Mary-Kay Washington', 'Bruce J Aronow', 'Noah F Shroyer']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Gastroenterology""","""['SPDEF Induces Quiescence of Colorectal Cancer Cells by\xa0Changing the Transcriptional Targets of β-catenin.', 'Histone Demethylase JMJD2D Interacts With β-Catenin to Induce Transcription and Activate Colorectal Cancer Cell Proliferation and Tumor Growth in Mice.', 'TRIB3 Interacts With β-Catenin and TCF4 to Increase Stem Cell Features of Colorectal Cancer Stem Cells and Tumorigenesis.', 'The role of SPDEF in cancer: promoter or suppressor.', 'Mouse Models for Application in Colorectal Cancer: Understanding the Pathogenesis and Relevance to the Human Condition.', 'Construction of an Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition-Related Model for Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma Prognosis Prediction.', 'SPINKs in Tumors: Potential Therapeutic Targets.', 'SPDEF suppresses head and neck squamous cell carcinoma progression by transcriptionally activating NR4A1.', 'A CRISPR/Cas9-Engineered ARID1A-Deficient Human Gastric Cancer Organoid Model Reveals Essential and Nonessential Modes of Oncogenic Transformation.', 'Atonal bHLH transcription factor 1 is an important factor for maintaining the balance of cell proliferation and differentiation in tumorigenesis.']"""

(Asteraceae) preparations are used in folk medicine in Cameroon to treat a number of ailments, including prostate cancer and malaria, and is used as an anthelmintic, adaptogen and antidote. The aim of this study was to continue the validation of the activity of Vernonia guineensis Benth. extracts and isolated molecules against cancer cell lines following the previous isolation of an anti-prostate cancer sugar ester from the root extract.  Materials and methods:   Acetone extracts of Vernonia guineensis Benth. leaves were tested for activity against 10 cancer cell lines (Breast-MDA-MB-231, Breast-MCF-7, Colon-HCT-116, Leukemia-HL-60, Lung-A549, Melanoma-A375, Ovarian-OVCAR3, Pancreas-Mia-paca, Prostate-PC-3 and Prostate-DU-145). The acetone extract was subjected to bioactivity guided fractionation. Anti-proliferation and clonogenic activity of the isolated compounds were tested. The WST-1 assay was used for the anti-proliferation activity, while the standard clonogenic test was used to determine the clonogenic activity.  Results:   The acetone extract of Vernonia guineensis Benth. demonstrated in vitro activity ranging from IC50 4-26μg/mL against the 10 cell lines. Activity guided fractionation of this extract yielded two sesquiterpene lactones, isolated for the first time from the genus Vernonia. The compounds were characterized using spectroscopic experiments, including a combination of 1D and 2D NMR data. Vernopicrin (1) and Vernomelitensin (2) demonstrated in vitro activity against human cancer cell lines with IC50 ranging from 0.35-2.04μM (P<0.05) and 0.13-1.5μM (P<0.05), respectively, between the most and least sensitive cell lines for each compound. Vernopicrin was most active against the human melanoma (A375) cell line and least active against the lung cancer (A549) cell line, while Vernomelitensin was also most active against the human melanoma (A375) cell line and least active against the breast cancer (MCF-7) cell line. Both compounds also demonstrated anticlonogenic activity.  Conclusion:   The cytotoxicity demonstrated by the crude extract and isolated sesquiterpenes against cancer cell lines highlights the medicinal potential of V. guineensis. The selective anti-proliferation and dose dependent anticlonogenic activities suggest that the identified sesquiterpenes could be potential antitumor agents.""","""['Ngeh J Toyang', 'Hippolyte K Wabo', 'Eugene N Ateh', 'Harry Davis', 'Pierre Tane', 'Luc B Sondengam', 'Joseph Bryant', 'Rob Verpoorte']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Ethnopharmacol""","""['In vitro anti-prostate cancer and ex vivo antiangiogenic activity of Vernonia guineensis Benth.

Materials and methods:   We performed a nested case-control study of gene promoter methylation status for 5 genes (APC, RARB, CCND2, RASSF1 and MGMT) measured in benign biopsy specimens from 511 prostate cancer case-control pairs. We estimated the overall and race stratified risk of subsequent prostate cancer associated with methylation status.  Results:   On race stratified analysis RARB methylation was associated with a higher cancer risk in black American men (OR 2.18, 95% CI 1.39-3.44). APC methylation was associated with an increased risk of high grade tumors (OR 2.43, 95% CI 1.20-4.90), which was higher in black than in white men (OR 3.21 vs 2.04). In cases RARB and APC gene methylation in benign prostate samples persisted in matched malignant specimens. In black cases the combined risk associated with RARB and APC methylation (OR 3.04, 95% CI 1.44-6.42) was greater than the individual risk of each gene and significantly different from that in white cases (OR 1.14, 95% CI 0.56-2.30).

Objective:   To test the accuracy of serum isoform [-2]proPSA (p2PSA) and its derivatives, percentage of p2PSA to free PSA (fPSA; %p2PSA) and the Prostate Health Index (PHI)-called index tests-in discriminating between patients with and without PCa.  Design, setting, and participants:   This was an observational, prospective cohort study of patients from five European urologic centers with a total PSA (tPSA) range of 2-10 ng/ml who were subjected to initial prostate biopsy for suspected PCa.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The primary end point was to evaluate the specificity, sensitivity, and diagnostic accuracy of index tests in determining the presence of PCa at prostate biopsy in comparison to tPSA, fPSA, and percentage of fPSA to tPSA (%fPSA) (standard tests) and the number of prostate biopsies that could be spared using these tests. Multivariable logistic regression models were complemented by predictive accuracy analysis and decision curve analysis.  Results and limitations:   Of >646 patients, PCa was diagnosed in 264 (40.1%). Median tPSA (5.7 vs 5.8 ng/ml; p=0.942) and p2PSA (15.0 vs 14.7 pg/ml) did not differ between groups; conversely, median fPSA (0.7 vs 1 ng/ml; p<0.001), %fPSA (0.14 vs 0.17; p<0.001), %p2PSA (2.1 vs 1.6; p<0.001), and PHI (48.2 vs 38; p<0.001) did differ significantly between men with and without PCa. In multivariable logistic regression models, p2PSA, %p2PSA, and PHI significantly increased the accuracy of the base multivariable model by 6.4%, 5.6%, and 6.4%, respectively (all p<0.001). At a PHI cut-off of 27.6, a total of 100 (15.5%) biopsies could have been avoided. The main limitation is that cases were selected on the basis of their initial tPSA values.

We performed a prospective study of all patients with prostate cancer (n = 134) with a preoperative Gleason score of ≥ 7 and/or prostate-specific antigen level >10 ng/mL undergoing ePLND before RARP using transperitoneal access at our institute from July 2008 to August 2011. The standardized procedure consisted of 10 distinct surgical steps. Dissection obtained all lymph nodes and surrounding fatty tissue in a single monoblock applying the following ePLND template: cranially, the ureter crossing the common iliac artery; caudally, the femoral canal; laterally, the medial border of the external iliac artery; and medially, the medial border of the hypogastric artery. The number of resected lymph nodes and postoperative ePLND-related complications according to the modified Clavien classification were documented.  Results:   The median number of resected lymph nodes was 14 (interquartile range 11-19). Complications related to ePLND were seen in 8 patients (5.9%).

Materials and methods:   The LBM and blood samples were studied before and after 6 months of ADT in 72 patients with localized prostate cancer. The LBM was assessed using a foot-to-foot bioelectrical impedance analyzer.  Results:   Before ADT, the LBM correlated with none of the serum sex steroid levels; however, it correlated closely with serum 5α-androstane-3α,17β-diol glucuronide (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient = 0.409, P = .001) and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-I, Spearman's rank correlation coefficient = 0.329, P = .005). After ADT, the LBM decreased by 0.9% (P = .036), and the serum testosterone and dihydrotestosterone had decreased by 96.8% and 94.3%, respectively (P <.001 for both), and the IGF-I had increased by 11.6% (from 19.9 to 22.2 nmol/L, P = .001). The serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D] levels decreased after ADT by 9.8% (from 66.2 to 59.7 pg/mL, P = .008), and the post-treatment LBM correlated inversely with 1,25(OH)2D (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient = -0.343, P = .003). The post-treatment LBM was dissociated with 5α-androstane-3α,17β-diol glucuronide and IGF-I. The pretreatment and post-treatment LBMs both correlated inversely with serum sex hormone-binding globulin (P = .024 and P = .016, respectively).  Conclusion:   The deficiency in androgen levels was suggested to be a link to the ADT-related decrease in LBM; the androgen metabolite 5α-androstane-3α,17β-diol glucuronide has a potential value for assessing the LBM in untreated men. IGF-I also promotes muscle building and is positively regulated during ADT. Sex hormone-binding globulin possibly accelerates the ADT-related decrease in LBM.

Materials and methods:   We analyzed 80 patients who underwent systematic transrectal, targeted transrectal, and targeted perineal biopsies. Each patient was diagnosed preoperatively by HistoScanning, defining a maximum of 3 suspicious areas. These areas were biopsied, both transrectally and via the perineum, with a maximum of 3 cores per location.  Results:   We detected prostatitis in 30 patients (37.5%), premalignant lesions in 10 (12.5%), and prostate cancer in 28 (35%). The transrectal technique was used to detect 78.6% of all cancers using 14 cores by systematic biopsy. With a maximum of 9 targeted cores, 82.1% of all cancers were detected with the targeted perineal approach and 53.6% were detected with the targeted transrectal approach. Although our data did not show significant difference in the performance of targeted transperineal compared with systematic transrectal biopsies, the detection rate of targeted transrectal biopsies was significantly lower.  Conclusion:   The presented targeted biopsy scheme achieved an overall detection rate of 85% of prostate-specific antigen-relevant pathologic lesions within the prostate. Thus, the presented procedure shows an improved detection rate compared with standard systematic prostate biopsies, and the number of cores required is reduced. Furthermore, the perineal HistoScanning-aided approach seems to be superior to the transrectal approach with respect to the prostate cancer detection rate.

Methods:   PNI is a routinely reported pathologic parameter for prostate biopsy specimens. We identified 3226 patients undergoing radical prostatectomy for clinically localized prostate cancer at our institution between 1994 and 2010. We used multivariable logistic regression models to examine whether PNI was independently associated with extraprostatic extension, seminal vesicle invasion, and surgical margin status. We used Kaplan-Meier methods and the log-rank test to assess disease-free, prostate cancer-specific, and overall survival according to PNI status. Cox proportional hazards modeling was used to evaluate relationships between PNI and survival outcomes.  Results:   PNI was identified in the prostate biopsy specimen in 20% of patients who underwent radical prostatectomy. Patients with PNI were more likely to have adverse pathologic features, including extraprostatic extension, seminal vesicle invasion, and positive surgical margins. Patients with PNI had shorter disease-free, cancer-specific, and overall survival (all log-rank P <.001).

Materials and methods:   All 3448 men diagnosed with localized prostate cancer at Kaiser Permanente Southern California from 2006 to 2007 were identified. The patients were passively followed up through their electronic health records until definitive treatment, defined as the first treatment given with curative intent within 1 year of diagnosis. Cox proportional hazard models, with PROC SURVEYPHREG procedures, were used to account for the variability in time to the different treatments within multiple medical centers.  Results:   The overall median time to treatment was 102 days, with modest differences for whites (100 days), blacks (104 days), and Hispanics (99 days). In the adjusted model, black men had a significantly longer time to surgery (adjusted hazard ratio 0.74, 95% confidence interval 0.56-0.91) compared with white men. Hispanic men (adjusted hazard ratio 1.44, 95% confidence interval 1.07-1.74) experienced significantly shorter times to radiotherapy compared with white men. No difference was found in the time to radiotherapy or brachytherapy for black men relative to white men.

To be eligible, patients were required to be treated with IMRT and have a minimum of 15-month follow up. HRQoL was assessed at baseline, 3, 9 and 15-24 months using the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite questionnaire. Higher scores reflected better HRQoL.

This study aimed to identify whether early, regular use of sildenafil after radiation treatment for prostate cancer is effective at reducing the rate of ED at 2 years.  Methods:   A randomised controlled trial with 27 men planned for radiation treatment for localised prostate cancer recruited from a single radiotherapy centre in Australia. Men were randomised to receive daily sildenafil, or a placebo tablet, for 6 months. The primary end-point was erectile function, as measured by the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) score, at 2-year follow-up. The abridged IIEF-5 survey was also used during the treatment period, and could be derived from the full IIEF at other time-points. Two-sided Student's t-tests and Mann-Whitney U-tests were used for the analysis of continuous outcomes, with Fisher's exact test for dichotomous outcomes.  Results:   No difference was seen at 2 years in the primary end-point, and IIEF scores did not differ significantly between groups during the study. Men in the sildenafil group exhibited significantly better IIEF-5 scores at 4 weeks (P = 0.02) and 6 months (P = 0.02). There was no difference in erectile function scores between the two groups throughout the treatment period. No significant difference in adverse events was identified between the two groups.  Conclusion:   There was no evidence from this trial that sildenafil provides long-term erectile function for patients while on medication.

Pain is one of the first and most important clinical symptoms of bone metastases and can be found among more than 80% of patients. Therefore, the most analgetic effective and simultaneously the least toxic treatment is an important point of therapeutic management in this group of patients. The aim of this prospective clinical trial was a comparison of analgetic effectiveness and toxicity of monotherapy with 153Sm isotope to combined therapy (153Sm + EBRT) among patients diagnosed with multiple painful bone metastases due to CRPC (mCRPC). 177 patients with mCRPC were included into the prospective randomised clinical trial in which 89 patients were assigned to the 153Sm isotope monotherapy, while 88 patients were assigned to the combined therapy including 153Sm isotope therapy and EBRT. All patients were diagnosed (bone scan and X-ray or/and CT or/and MRI) with painful bone metastases (bone pain intensity >= 6 according to VAS classification). The following additional inclusion criteria were established: histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of prostate, multifocal bone metastases, no prior chemotherapy or palliative radiotherapy to bone. All patients signed informed consent.The combination of the isotope therapy with EBRT was more effective analgetic treatment than isotope therapy alone. The highest pain decline was noticed in the first weeks after treatment termination. In the whole group, a total or partial analgesic effect was observed among 154 (87%) patients while among 23 (13%) patients there was a lack of analgesic effect or even pain intensification. The results of this clinical trial demonstrated that for patients with multiple mCRPC it is recommended to combine the 153Sm isotope therapy with local EBRT because of a greater analgetic effect.

However, specific methods for efficient and reliable cell seeding into these and tissue-engineering constructs used for regenerative medicine often remain poorly defined. Here, we describe a capillary force-based method for seeding the human prostate cancer cell lines M12 and LNCaP C4-2 into sphere-templated poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) hydrogels. The capillary force seeding method improved the cell number and distribution within the porous scaffolds compared to well-established protocols such as static and centrifugation seeding. Seeding efficiency was found to be strongly dependent on the rounded cell diameter relative to the pore diameter and pore interconnect size, parameters that can be controllably modulated during scaffold fabrication. Cell seeding efficiency was evaluated quantitatively using a PicoGreen DNA assay, which demonstrated some variation in cell retention using the capillary force method. When cultured within the porous hydrogels, both cell lines attached and proliferated within the network, but histology showed the formation of a necrotic zone by 7 days likely due to oxygen and nutrient diffusional limitations. The necrotic zone thickness was decreased by dynamically culturing cells in an orbital shaker. Proliferation analysis showed that despite a variable seeding efficiency, by 7 days in culture, scaffolds contained a roughly consistent number of cells as they proliferated to fill the pores of the scaffold. These studies demonstrate that sphere-templated polymeric scaffolds have the potential to serve as an adaptable cell culture substrate for engineering a three-dimensional prostate cancer model.""","""['Thomas J Long', 'Marc Takeno', 'Cynthia C Sprenger', 'Stephen R Plymate', 'Buddy D Ratner']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Tissue Eng Part C Methods""","""['Prostate cancer xenografts engineered from 3D precision-porous poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) hydrogels as models for tumorigenesis and dormancy escape.', 'Presence of pores and hydrogel composition influence tensile properties of scaffolds fabricated from well-defined sphere templates.', 'Biomimetic modification of dual porosity poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) hydrogel scaffolds-porosity and stem cell growth evaluation.', 'Potential of centrifugal seeding method in improving cells distribution and proliferation on demineralized cancellous bone scaffolds for tissue-engineered meniscus.', 'Application of low-pressure cell seeding system in tissue engineering.', 'Employing hydrogels in tissue engineering approaches to boost conventional cancer-based research and therapies.', 'Medical Applications of Porous Biomaterials: Features of Porosity and Tissue-Specific Implications for Biocompatibility.', 'Inorganic-Organic Interpenetrating Network Hydrogels as Tissue-Integrating Luminescent Implants: Physicochemical Characterization and Preclinical Evaluation.', 'Near-Infrared Optical Nanosensors for Continuous Detection of Glucose.', 'Prostate cancer xenografts engineered from 3D precision-porous poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) hydrogels as models for tumorigenesis and dormancy escape.']"""

Thereat, cancer of the lower end the colon (rectum) comprises 45 to 48% of all CRC (colorectal cancers). According to ""American Society Cancer"", only lung and prostate cancer in men and breast and cervix cancer in women are more frequent than CRC. The incidence of colorectal cancer is 20 to 30/100.000 citizens. Rectal cancer is the result of interection of disturbed genetic factors with external factors. The first surgical treatments began with Faget, who did the first rectal extraperitoneal excision (1739). It was improved by Ernest Milles in 1908, and in 1923, Hartman did the resection without anamnesis. In the middle of 20th century, Dixon defined the resective interventions and in Litre did a colostomy. The aim of this study is point out the necessity of early diagnosis and protocolar chirurgical end oncological approach to the treatment of this malignant disease which must be done before choosing any operative procedure in order to prevent postoperative morbidity. On the material of the Clinic for Abdominal Surgery at the Clinical centre University of Sarajevo, during the four-year period (from 2006 to 2010), out of the 406 patients with CRC, 261 of them (64.3%) had cancer of the final part of the colon and rectum. In this case, all the time of the treatment, protocol was strictly applied. Primary surgery was performed on the early stages of the disease. Radiochemotherapy (RCT) followed by operation after 6 to 8 week is applied in the progressive state of the disease with the penetration of the meso rectal fascia with positive lymph-gland assessment (NMR-nuclear magnete resonance). Out of 261 operated patients, 5 of them (1.9%) underwent transanal resections where the tumour was up to 2 cm; 104 patients (39.8%) underwent rectal resection with TME (II and III tumour states of recto-sigma); 24 (9.2%) patients uderwent amputation; 156 (22.4%) underwent left chemicolectomy with rectal resection and 29 (11%) underwent intersphincteric colo-trans-versal-anal anastomosis. The operation by Hartman was performed on 44 (16.8%) patients and colostomy on 10 (3.8%) patients in emergency service. In the tumours with low localisation we do low colo-transversal-rectal or ultra-low intersphincer colo-anal anastomosis. Total meso rectal excision and lymhadenectomy is our priority. We fully respect the oncologic approach, i.e. complete removement of the affected organ with the lymphovascular arcade. Operative lethality up to 30 days was 2.5% (comorbidity, thromboembolism). Owing to combined protocolar approach of surgical and radiochemotherapy, extirpational interventions are not so frequent any more compared with resections with low and ultra-low anastomosis.

All the 3508 subjects had initial negative prostate biopsy and were biopsied at Year 2 and 4 for detection of PCa. The G84E mutation was detected only in Caucasians, with the highest carrier frequency in Northern Europe (1.06%), followed by Western Europe (0.60%) and North America (0.31%). No mutation carrier was observed in Southern Europe, Eastern Europe, Latin America, Australia and South Africa. In Caucasians, the G84E mutation frequency was 0.99% and 0.24% in positive and negative biopsy subjects, respectively (P = 0.01). In positive biopsy subjects, the frequency was significantly higher in subjects with a positive family history than those without (4.31% versus 0.34%, P = 0.002). In the 4 year follow-up, the PCa detection rate was 53.8% among the 13 mutation carriers and 22.0% among 3186 non-carriers, relative risk = 2.45 (95% confidence interval: 1.48-4.07). All mutation carriers shared a common haplotype, suggesting a founder effect. In Finland, the G84E mutation was estimated to occur in the year 1792 (95% credible interval: 1735-1831).

Such a risk is likely influenced by histological and treatment differences between CNS tumors. De-identified data for 41,159 patients with a primary CNS tumor diagnosis from 9 Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) registries were used to calculate potential risk for subsequent cancer development. Relative risk (RR) and 95 % confidence interval (CI) of subsequent cancer was calculated using SEER*Stat 7.0.9, comparing observed number of subsequent cancers versus expected in the general United States population. For all CNS tumors studied, there were 830 subsequent cancers with a RR of 1.26 (95 % CI, 1.18-1.35). Subsequent cancers were observed in the CNS, digestive system, bones/joints, soft tissue, thyroid and leukemia. Radiotherapy was associated with an elevated risk, particularly in patients diagnosed with a medulloblastoma/primitive neuroectodermal tumor (MPNET). MPNET patients who received radiotherapy were at a significant risk for development of cancers of the digestive system, leukemia, bone/joint and cranial nerves. Glioblastoma multiforme patients who received radiotherapy were at lower risks for female breast and prostate cancers, though at an elevated risk for cancers of the thyroid and brain. Radiotherapy is associated with subsequent cancer development, particularly for sites within the field of radiation, though host susceptibility and post-treatment status underlie this risk.

However, the detailed mechanism by which sodium selenite specifically kills tumor cells remains unclear. Herein, we demonstrated that supranutritional doses of selenite-induced apoptosis in CRC cells through reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent modulation of the PI3K/AKT/FoxO3a signaling pathway. First, we found that selenite treatment in HCT116 and SW480 CRC cells caused inhibition of AKT and the nuclear accumulation of FoxO3a by western blot and immunofluorescence analyses, respectively, thereby facilitating transcription of the target genes bim and PTEN. Modulation of the AKT/FoxO3a/Bim signaling pathway by chemical inhibitors or RNA interference revealed that these events were critical for selenite-induced apoptosis in CRC cells. Additionally, we discovered that FoxO3a-mediated upregulation of PTEN exerted a further inhibitory effect on the AKT survival pathway. We also corroborated our findings in vivo by performing immunohistochemistry experiments. In summary, our results show that selenite could induce ROS-dependent FoxO3a-mediated apoptosis in CRC cells and xenograft tumors through PTEN-mediated inhibition of the PI3K/AKT survival axis.

Prostate cancer-related deaths are largely attributable to the development of hormone resistance in the tumor. No effective chemotherapy has yet been developed for advanced prostate cancer. It is desirable if a drug can be delivered directly and specifically to prostate cancer cells. Stem cells have selective migration ability toward cancer cells and therapeutic genes can be easily transduced into stem cells. In one form of gene therapy for cancer, the stem cells carry a gene encoding an enzyme that transforms an inert prodrug into a toxic product. Cytosine deaminase (CD) transforms the pro-drug 5-fluorocytosine into highly cytotoxic 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). The migration of the genetically modified stem cells was monitored by molecular magnetic resonance imaging, after labeling the stem cells with fluorescent magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs). Human neural stem cells encoding CD (HB1.F3.CD) were prepared and labeled with MNP. In tumor-bearing C57B mice, systemically transplanted HB1.F3.CD stem cells migrated toward the tumor and in combination with prodrug 5-FC, the volume of tumor implant was significantly reduced.

We used highly standardized reverse-transcription (RT)-PCR assays to compare transcript levels of 10 candidate cancer marker genes - BMP6, FGF-8b, KLK2, KLK3, KLK4, KLK15, MSMB, PCA3, PSCA and Trpm8 - in carefully ascertained non-cancerous versus cancerous prostate tissue from patients with clinically localized prostate cancer treated by radical prostatectomy.  Design and methods:   Total RNA was isolated from fresh frozen prostate tissue procured immediately after resection from two separate areas in each of 87 radical prostatectomy specimens. Subsequent histopathological assessment classified 86 samples as cancerous and 88 as histologically benign prostate tissue. Variation in total RNA recovery was accounted for by using external and internal standards and enabled us to measure transcript levels by RT-PCR in a highly quantitative manner.  Results:   Of the ten genes, there were significantly higher levels only of one of the less abundant transcripts, PCA3, in cancerous versus non-cancerous prostate tissue whereas PSCA mRNA levels were significantly lower in cancerous versus histologically benign tissue. Advanced pathologic stage was associated with significantly higher expression of KLK15 and PCA3 mRNAs. Median transcript levels of the most abundantly expressed genes (i.e. MSMB, KLK3, KLK4 and KLK2) in prostate tissue were up to 10(5)-fold higher than those of other gene targets.

The speed of sound (SOS) is assumed to be constant in all human soft tissues at a generally accepted average value of 1540 m s(-1). This assumption is a source of systematic errors up to several millimeters and of image distortion in quantitative US imaging. In this work, an extension of a method recently published by Fontanarosa et al (2011 Med. Phys. 38 2665-73) is presented: the aim is to correct SOS aberrations in three-dimensional (3D) US images in those cases where a spatially co-registered computerized tomography (CT) scan is also available; the algorithm is then applicable to a more general case where the lines of view (LOV) of the US device are not necessarily parallel and coplanar, thus allowing correction also for US transducers other than linear. The algorithm was applied on a multi-modality pelvic US phantom, scanned through three different liquid layers on top of the phantom with different SOS values; the results show that the correction restores a better match between the CT and the US images, reducing the differences to sub-millimeter agreement. Fifteen clinical cases of prostate cancer patients were also investigated: the SOS corrections of prostate centroids were on average +3.1 mm (max + 4.9 mm-min + 1.3 mm). This is in excellent agreement with reports in the literature on differences between measured prostate positions by US and other techniques, where often the discrepancy was attributed to other causes.""","""['Davide Fontanarosa', 'Silvia Pesente', 'Francesco Pascoli', 'Denis Ermacora', 'Imad Abu Rumeileh', 'Frank Verhaegen']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['A CT based correction method for speed of sound aberration for ultrasound based image guided radiotherapy.', 'On the significance of density-induced speed of sound variations on US-guided radiotherapy.', 'Magnitude of speed of sound aberration corrections for ultrasound image guided radiotherapy for prostate and other anatomical sites.', 'A review of calibration techniques for freehand 3-D ultrasound systems.', 'Review of ultrasound image guidance in external beam radiotherapy: I.

Functional analyses do not fully explain the selective pressure causing ERG rearrangement during the development of prostate cancer. To identify transcriptional changes in prostate cancer, including tumors with ERG gene rearrangements, we performed a meta-analysis on published gene expression data followed by validations on mRNA and protein levels as well as first functional investigations. Eight expression studies (n = 561) on human prostate tissues were included in the meta-analysis. Transcriptional changes between prostate cancer and non-cancerous prostate, as well as ERG rearrangement-positive (ERG+) and ERG rearrangement-negative (ERG-) prostate cancer, were analyzed. Detailed results can be accessed through an online database. We validated our meta-analysis using data from our own independent microarray study (n = 57). 84% and 49% (fold-change>2 and >1.5, respectively) of all transcriptional changes between ERG+ and ERG- prostate cancer determined by meta-analysis were verified in the validation study. Selected targets were confirmed by immunohistochemistry: NPY and PLA2G7 (up-regulated in ERG+ cancers), and AZGP1 and TFF3 (down-regulated in ERG+ cancers). First functional investigations for one of the most prominent ERG rearrangement-associated genes - neuropeptide Y (NPY) - revealed increased glucose uptake in vitro indicating the potential role of NPY in regulating cellular metabolism. In summary, we found robust population-independent transcriptional changes in prostate cancer and first signs of ERG rearrangements inducing metabolic changes in cancer cells by activating major metabolic signaling molecules like NPY.

We studied the effect of not accounting for attendance on the calculated excess mortality in a prostate cancer screening trial.  Methods:   The numerator of the excess mortality rate related to prostate cancer diagnoses in each study arm equals the excess number of deaths observed in the cancer patients. The estimation of the expected number of deaths in the absence of the prostate cancer diagnoses has to account for the self-selection of those participating in the trial, particularly if the proportion of non-participants is substantial.  Setting:   The European prostate cancer screening trial (ERSPC).  Results:   In the screening arm, non-attendees had roughly twice the mortality rate of attendees. Approximately twice as many cancers were detected in the screening arm compared with the control arm, primarily in attendees. Unless attendance is properly accounted for, the expected mortality of prostate cancer patients in the screening arm is overestimated by 0.9-3.6 deaths per 1000 person-years.  Conclusions:   Attendees have a lower all-cause mortality rate (are healthier) and a higher probability of a prostate cancer diagnosis than non-attendees and the men randomized to the control arm. If attendance is not accounted for, the excess mortality and the between-arm excess mortality rate ratio are underestimated and screening is considered more effective than it actually is.

This study aimed to characterize the localization and expression of AT2R in prostate tissues and to assess its role on cell morphology and number in prostatic epithelial cells in primary culture.  Methods:   AT2R and its AT2R-interacting protein (ATIP) expression were assessed on non-tumoral and tumoral human prostate using tissue microarray immunohistochemistry, binding assay, and Western blotting. AT2R effect on cell number was measured in primary cultures of epithelial cells from non-tumoral human prostate.  Results:   AT2R was localized at the level of the acinar epithelial layer and its expression decreased in cancers with a Gleason score 6 or higher. In contrast, ATIP expression increased with cancer progression. Treatment of primary cell cultures from non-tumoral prostate tissues with C21/M024, a selective AT2R agonist, alone or in co-incubation with losartan, an AT1R antagonist, significantly decreased cell number compared to untreated cells.  Conclusions:   AT2R and ATIP are present in non-tumoral human prostate tissues and differentially regulated according to Gleason score.

Our main result is to demonstrate that some of the most frequently used gene set methods, GSEA, GSEArot and GAGE, are severely influenced by the filtering of the data in a way that such an analysis is no longer reconcilable with the principles of statistical inference, rendering the obtained results in the worst case inexpressive. A possible consequence of this is that these methods can increase their power by the addition of unrelated data and noise. Our results are obtained within a bootstrapping framework that allows a rigorous assessment of the robustness of results and enables power estimates. Our results indicate that when using competitive gene set methods, it is imperative to apply a stringent gene filtering criterion. However, even when genes are filtered appropriately, for gene expression data from chips that do not provide a genome-scale coverage of the expression values of all mRNAs, this is not enough for GSEA, GSEArot and GAGE to ensure the statistical soundness of the applied procedure.

Novel mechanistic understandings in cancer cell chemotherapeutic sensitivity and resistance can optimize treatment and improve patient outcome. Molecular alterations in the metabolic pathways are associated with cancer development; however, the role of these alterations in chemotherapy efficacy is largely unknown.  Methods:   In a bed-side to bench-side reverse translational approach, we used cDNA microarray and qRT-PCR to identify genes that are associated with biochemical relapse after chemotherapy. Further, we tested the function of these genes in cell proliferation, metabolism, and chemosensitivity in prostate cancer cell lines.  Results:   We report that the gene encoding mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase 2 (MDH2) is overexpressed in clinical prostate cancer specimens. Patients with MDH2 overexpression had a significantly shorter period of relapse-free survival (RFS) after undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy. To understand the molecular mechanism underlying this clinical observation, we observed that MDH2 expression was elevated in prostate cancer cell lines compared to benign prostate epithelial cells. Stable knockdown of MDH2 via shRNA in prostate cancer cell lines decreased cell proliferation and increased docetaxel sensitivity. Further, MDH2 shRNA enhanced docetaxel-induced activations of JNK signaling and induced metabolic inefficiency.  Conclusion:   Taken together, these data suggest a novel function for MDH2 in prostate cancer development and chemotherapy resistance, in which MDH2 regulates chemotherapy-induced signal transduction and oxidative metabolism.""","""['Qiong Liu', 'Chris T Harvey', 'Hao Geng', 'Changhui Xue', 'Vivian Chen', 'Tomasz M Beer', 'David Z Qian']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['ID1 enhances docetaxel cytotoxicity in prostate cancer cells through inhibition of p21.', 'Metabolic shift toward oxidative phosphorylation in docetaxel resistant prostate cancer cells.', 'CCL2 is induced by chemotherapy and protects prostate cancer cells from docetaxel-induced cytotoxicity.', 'Nanoways to overcome docetaxel resistance in prostate cancer.', 'Second-line chemotherapy in metastatic docetaxel-resistant prostate cancer: a review.', 'Long-Chain Acyl Coenzyme A Dehydrogenase, a Key Player in Metabolic Rewiring/Invasiveness in Experimental Tumors and Human Mesothelioma Cell Lines.', 'The impact of RNA binding proteins and the associated long non-coding RNAs in the TCA cycle on cancer pathogenesis.', 'Palmitoylation of MDH2 by ZDHHC18 activates mitochondrial respiration and accelerates ovarian cancer growth.', 'Metabolic Phenotyping in Prostate Cancer Using Multi-Omics Approaches.', 'Targeting the Intrinsic Apoptosis Pathway: A Window of Opportunity for Prostate Cancer.']"""

FOXO1, a key downstream effector of PTEN, inhibits androgen-independent activation of the AR. However, the underlying mechanism remains elusive.  Methods:   The inhibitory effect of FOXO1 on full-length and constitutively active splice variants of the AR was examined by luciferase reporter assays and real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). In vitro protein binding assays and western blot analyses were used to determine the regions in FOXO1 and AR responsible for their interaction.  Results:   We found that a putative transcription repression domain in the NH2-terminus of FOXO1 is dispensable for FOXO1 inhibition of the AR. In vitro protein binding assays showed that FOXO1 binds to the transcription activation unit 5 (TAU5) motif in the AR NH2-terminal domain (NTD), a region required for recruitment of p160 activators including SRC-1. Ectopic expression of SRC-1 augmented transcriptional activity of some, but not all AR splice variants examined. Forced expression of FOXO1 blocked the effect of SRC-1 on AR variants' transcriptional activity by decreasing the binding of SRC-1 to the AR NTD. Ectopic expression of FOXO1 inhibited expression of endogenous genes activated primarily by alternatively spliced AR variants in human castration-resistant PCa 22Rv1 cells.

Major unanswered questions include what pathogenic mechanisms, such as bacterial infections, may drive the accumulation of inflammatory infiltrates in the human prostate, and how inflammation might contribute to disease. To study this potential link in an in vivo system, we developed a mouse model of long-term bacteria-induced chronic inflammation of the prostate using a human prostatectomy-derived strain of Propionibacterium acnes.  Methods:   C57BL/6J mice were inoculated, via urethral catheterization, with vehicle control or a prostatectomy-derived strain of P. acnes (PA2). Animals were assessed at 2 days, 1, 2, or 8 weeks post-inoculation via histology and immunohistochemistry (IHC).  Results:   PA2 inoculation resulted in severe acute and chronic inflammation confined to the dorsal lobe of the prostate. Chronic inflammation persisted for at least 8 weeks post-inoculation. Inflammatory lesions were associated with an increase in the Ki-67 proliferative index, and diminished Nkx3.1 and androgen receptor (AR) production. Interestingly, the observed response required live bacteria and both IHC and in situ hybridization assays for P. acnes indicated a potential intracellular presence of P. acnes in prostate epithelial cells.  Conclusions:   To our knowledge, this is the first mouse model of long-term prostatic inflammation induced by P. acnes, and more generally, any prostatectomy-derived bacterial isolate. This model may serve as a valuable preclinical model of chronic prostatic inflammation that can be used to mechanistically study the link between inflammation and prostatic disease.""","""['Debika Biswal Shinohara', 'Ajay M Vaghasia', 'Shu-Han Yu', 'Tim N Mak', 'Holger Brüggemann', 'William G Nelson', 'Angelo M De Marzo', 'Srinivasan Yegnasubramanian', 'Karen S Sfanos']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Propionibacterium acnes associated with inflammation in radical prostatectomy specimens: a possible link to cancer evolution?', 'Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) analysis of Propionibacterium acnes isolates from radical prostatectomy specimens.', 'Intracellular Propionibacterium acnes infection in glandular epithelium and stromal macrophages of the prostate with or without cancer.', 'Prostate Infiltration by Treg and Th17 Cells as an Immune Response to Propionibacterium acnes Infection in the Course of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia and Prostate Cancer.', 'Links between Propionibacterium acnes and prostate cancer.', 'Biochemical Recurrence in Prostate Cancer Is Associated with the Composition of Lactobacillus: Microbiome Analysis of Prostatic Tissue.', 'Insights into the Human Microbiome and Its Connections with Prostate Cancer.', 'Microbiota of Urine, Glans and Prostate Biopsies in Patients with Prostate Cancer Reveals a Dysbiosis in the Genitourinary System.', ""The Microbiome's Influence on Head and Neck Cancers."", 'Microbiome and Prostate Cancer: A Novel Target for Prevention and Treatment.']"""

The aim of this study was to determine if [(11)C]choline PET could be used to localize the carcinomatous tissue within the prostate in order to specifically target this area for example with high-precision radiation therapy.  Methods:   Included in this prospective study were 20 patients with histological proven prostate carcinoma who underwent [(11)C]choline PET/CT before radical prostatectomy. After surgical resection, specimens were fixed and cut into 5-mm step sections. In each section the area of the carcinoma was delineated manually by an experienced pathologist and digitalized, and the histopathological tumour volume was calculated. Shrinkage due to resection and fixation was corrected using in-vivo and ex-vivo CT data of the prostate. Histopathological tumour location and size were compared with the choline PET data. Different segmentation algorithms were applied to the PET data to segment the intraprostatic lesion volume.  Results:   A total of 28 carcinomatous lesions were identified on histopathology. Only 13 (46 %) of these lesions had corresponding focal choline uptake. In the remaining lesions, no PET uptake (2 lesions) or diffuse uptake not corresponding to the area of the carcinoma (13 lesions) was found. In the patients with corresponding PET lesions, no suitable SUV threshold (neither absolute nor relative) was found for GTV segmentation to fit the volume to the histological tumour volume.  Conclusion:   The choline uptake pattern corresponded to the histological localization of prostate cancer in fewer than 50 % of lesions. Even when corresponding visual choline uptake was found, this uptake was highly variable between patients. Therefore SUV thresholding with standard algorithms did not lead to satisfying results with respect to defining tumour tissue in the prostate.""","""['Ralph A Bundschuh', 'Christina M Wendl', 'Gregor Weirich', 'Mathias Eiber', 'Michael Souvatzoglou', 'Uwe Treiber', 'Hubert Kübler', 'Tobias Maurer', 'Jürgen E Gschwend', 'Hans Geinitz', 'Anca L Grosu', 'Sibylle I Ziegler', 'Bernd Joachim Krause']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging""","""['Is there an additional value of ¹¹C-choline PET-CT to T2-weighted MRI images in the localization of intraprostatic tumor nodules?', '11C-Choline PET/pathology image coregistration in primary localized prostate cancer.', 'Imaging prostate cancer with 11C-choline PET/CT.', 'Imaging of prostate cancer with PET/CT and radioactively labeled choline derivates.', 'The role of choline positron emission tomography/computed tomography in the management of patients with prostate-specific antigen progression after radical treatment of prostate cancer.', 'A Novel Radiomics-Based Tumor Volume Segmentation Algorithm for Lung Tumors in FDG-PET/CT after 3D Motion Correction-A Technical Feasibility and Stability Study.', 'The Evolving Role of 18F-FDG PET/CT in Diagnosis and Prognosis Prediction in Progressive Prostate Cancer.', 'The impact of the co-registration technique and analysis methodology in comparison studies between advanced imaging modalities and whole-mount-histology reference in primary prostate cancer.', 'Multimodal imaging for radiation therapy planning in patients with primary prostate cancer.', 'Use of Imaging to Optimise Prostate Cancer Tumour Volume Assessment for Focal Therapy Planning.']"""

Methods and study design:   From 1999 to 2005, 1002 patients with T1-T3 prostate cancer were treated with 3D conformal radiation therapy, delivering a median dose of 75.6, 66.6 and 45 Gy to the prostate, seminal vesicles and pelvic nodes (if necessary), respectively. Patients were divided into four groups (<65, 65-70, 70-75, >75 years) according to age at diagnosis. The relationship between age and both overall survival and disease-free survival was calculated with Kaplan-Meier analysis and the comparison between curves was performed by the logrank test.

In multivariate analysis, there was no significant difference in the distribution of disease risk between age groups. Analysis demonstrated that older age is a strong positive predictor of survival (odds ratio for stratified patients older than 70 years was <1). In fact, at the 90 month follow-up, overall survival and disease-free survival varied with age, increasing from 85% to 95% and from 78% to 94%, respectively.

Under such a cell isolation strategy, however, the CTC purity is normally compromised. To address this issue, this study reports the integration of optically-induced-dielectrophoretic (ODEP) force-based cell manipulation, and a laminar flow regime in a microfluidic platform for the isolation of untreated, and highly pure CTCs after conventional negative selection-based CTC isolation. In the design, six sections of moving light-bar screens were continuously and simultaneously exerted in two parallel laminar flows to concurrently separate the cancer cells from the leukocytes based on their size difference and electric properties. The separated cell populations were further partitioned, delivered, and collected through the two flows. With this approach, the cancer cells can be isolated in a continuous, effective, and efficient manner. In this study, the operating conditions of ODEP for the manipulation of prostate cancer (PC-3) and human oral cancer (OEC-M1) cells, and leukocytes with minor cell aggregation phenomenon were first characterized. Moreover, performances of the proposed method for the isolation of cancer cells were experimentally investigated. The results showed that the presented CTC isolation scheme was able to isolate PC-3 cells or OEC-M1 cells from a leukocyte background with high recovery rate (PC-3 cells: 76-83%, OEC-M1 cells: 61-68%), and high purity (PC-3 cells: 74-82%, OEC-M1 cells: 64-66%) (set flow rate: 0.1 μl min(-1) and sample volume: 1 μl). The latter is beyond what is currently possible in the conventional CTC isolations. Moreover, the viability of isolated cancer cells was evaluated to be as high as 94 ± 2%, and 95 ± 3% for the PC-3, and OEC-M1 cells, respectively. Furthermore, the isolated cancer cells were also shown to preserve their proliferative capability. As a whole, this study has presented an ODEP-based microfluidic platform that is capable of isolating CTCs in a continuous, label-free, cell-friendly, and particularly highly pure manner.

Priming men about the availability of multiple options before they have a confirmed diagnosis may be an opportunity to engage patients in more informed decision-making.  Methods:   Men with an elevated PSA test or suspicious Digital Rectal Examination (DRE) who were referred to a urology clinic for a biopsy were randomized to receive either the clinic's usual care (UC) biopsy instruction sheet (n = 11) or a pre-biopsy educational (ED) packet containing the biopsy instruction sheet along with a booklet about the biopsy procedure and a prostate cancer treatment decision aid originally written for newly diagnosed men that described in detail possible treatment options (n = 18).  Results:   A total of 62% of men who were approached agreed to be randomized, and 83% of the ED group confirmed they used the materials. Anxiety scores were similar for both groups while awaiting the biopsy procedure, with anxiety scores trending lower in the ED group: 41.2 on a prostate-specific anxiety instrument compared to 51.7 in the UC group (p = 0.13). ED participants reported better overall quality of life while awaiting biopsy compared to the UC group (76.4 vs. 48.5, p = 0.01). The small number of men in the ED group who went on to be diagnosed with cancer reported being better informed about the risks and side effects of each option compared to men diagnosed with cancer in the UC group (p = 0.07). In qualitative discussions, men generally reported they found the pre-biopsy materials to be helpful and indicated having information about possible treatment options reduced their anxiety. However, 2 of 18 men reported they did not want to think about treatment options until after they knew their biopsy results.  Conclusions:   In this small sample offering pre-biopsy education about potential treatment options was generally well received by patients, appeared to be beneficial to men who went on to be diagnosed, and did not appear to increase anxiety unnecessarily among those who had a negative biopsy.""","""['Steven B Zeliadt', 'Peggy A Hannon', 'Ranak B Trivedi', 'Laura M Bonner', 'Thuy T Vu', 'Carol Simons', 'Crystal A Kimmie', 'Elaine Y Hu', 'Chris Zipperer', 'Daniel W Lin']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""BMC Med Inform Decis Mak""","""['Exploring the impact of providing men with information about potential prostate cancer treatment options prior to receiving biopsy results.', 'Active monitoring, radical prostatectomy and radical radiotherapy in PSA-detected clinically localised prostate cancer: the ProtecT three-arm RCT.', 'Anxiety symptoms prior to a prostate cancer diagnosis: Associations with knowledge and openness to treatment.', 'Clarifying uncertainty regarding detection and treatment of early-stage prostate cancer.', 'Decision aids for people facing health treatment or screening decisions.', 'Encouraging Patients to Ask Questions: Development and Pilot Testing of a Question Prompt List for Patients Undergoing a Biopsy for Suspected Prostate Cancer.', 'Exploring the impact of providing men with information about potential prostate cancer treatment options prior to receiving biopsy results.', ""Physicians' Perceptions of Factors Influencing the Treatment Decision-making Process for Men With Low-risk Prostate Cancer."", 'Characteristics and experiences of patients with localized prostate cancer who left an active surveillance program.']"""

Shear wave elastography is an imaging technique that assesses tissue stiffness using acoustic radiation force as an alternate to manual palpation reported previously with quasistatic elastography. In this study, the elastic properties of tissue mimicking materials, including agar, polyacrylamide (PAA), and silicone, are evaluated with an objective to determine material characteristics which resemble normal and cancerous prostate tissue.  Methods:   Acoustic properties and stiffness of tissue mimicking phantoms were measured using compressional mechanical testing and shear wave elastography using supersonic shear imaging. The latter is based on the principles of shear waves generated using acoustic radiation force. The evaluation included tissue mimicking materials (TMMs) within the prostate at different positions and sizes that could mimic cancerous and normal prostate tissue. Patient data on normal and prostate cancer tissues quantified using biopsy histopathology were used to validate the findings. Pathologist reports on histopathology were blinded to mechanical testing and elastographic findings.  Results:   Young's modulus values of 86.2 ± 4.5 and 271.5 ± 25.7 kPa were obtained for PAA mixed with 2% Al(2)O(3) particles and silicone, respectively. Young's modulus of TMMs from mechanical compression testing showed a clear trend of increasing stiffness with an increasing percentage of agar. The silicone material had higher stiffness values when compared with PAA with Al(2)O(3). The mean Young's modulus value in cancerous tissue was 90.5 ± 4.5 kPa as compared to 93.8 ± 4.4 and 86.2 ± 4.5 kPa obtained with PAA with 2% Al(2)O(3) phantom at a depth of 52.4 and 36.6 mm, respectively.

Methods:   Excised cadaver prostate specimens were embedded in tissue mimicking gel to simulate the properties of surrounding soft tissues. The samples were imaged at various depths using a laboratory prototyped VA imaging system. The recorded signals were used for offline processing and image reconstruction. In a selected subgroup of tissue samples, conventional ultrasound (B-mode) and x-ray imaging were performed for further analysis, evaluation, and validation of the VA images.  Results:   The imaging results of prostate tissue samples indicate the capability of VA imaging to detect prostatic nodules and lesions. In the prostate sample with an adenocarcinoma, the lesion appears with a clear contrast with respect to its surrounding tissue. The VA images could also identify the presence of calcifications deep inside the prostate tissue. Further, quantifications of the imaging results demonstrate that VA imaging has higher sensitivity to detect the calcifications compared to conventional ultrasound imaging. VA is also capable of visualizing prostatic tissue structures and in some cases can identify the anatomical zones. More specifically, the observed higher texture level in peripheral zones demonstrates the ability of VA to differentiate between prostatic anatomical zones.

The contouring accuracy on the current image guidance [image guided radiation therapy (IGRT)] scan is improved by combining contours from earlier IGRT scans via the simultaneous truth and performance level estimation (STAPLE) algorithm.  Methods:   Six IGRT prostate patients treated with daily kilo-voltage (kV) cone-beam CT (CBCT) had their original plan CT and nine CBCTs contoured by the same physician. Three types of automated contours were produced for analysis. (1) Plan: By deformably registering the plan CT to each CBCT and then using the resulting deformation field to morph the plan contours to match the CBCT anatomy. (2) Previous: The contour set drawn by the physician on the previous day CBCT is similarly deformed to match the current CBCT anatomy. (3) STAPLE: The contours drawn by the physician, on each prior CBCT and the plan CT, are deformed to match the CBCT anatomy to produce multiple contour sets. These sets are combined using the STAPLE algorithm into one optimal set.  Results:   Compared to plan and previous, STAPLE improved the average Dice's coefficient (DC) with the original physician drawn CBCT contours to a DC as follows: Bladder: 0.81 ± 0.13, 0.91 ± 0.06, and 0.92 ± 0.06; Prostate: 0.75 ± 0.08, 0.82 ± 0.05, and 0.84 ± 0.05; and Rectum: 0.79 ± 0.06, 0.81 ± 0.06, and 0.85 ± 0.04, respectively. The STAPLE results are within intraobserver consistency, determined by the physician blindly recontouring a subset of CBCTs. Comparing plans recalculated using the physician and STAPLE contours showed an average disagreement less than 1% for prostate D98 and mean dose, and 5% and 3% for bladder and rectum mean dose, respectively. One scan takes an average of 19 s to contour. Using five scans plus STAPLE takes less than 110 s on a 288 core graphics processor unit.  Conclusions:   Combining the plan and all prior days via the STAPLE algorithm to produce treatment day contours is superior to the current standard of deforming only the plan contours to the daily CBCT. STAPLE also improves the precision, with a substantial decrease in standard deviation, a key for adaptive therapy. Geometrically and dosimetrically accurate contours can be automatically generated with STAPLE on prostate region kV CBCT in a time scale suitable for online adaptive therapy.""","""['Andrew Godley', 'Lawrence J Sheplan Olsen', 'Kevin Stephans', 'Anzi Zhao']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Evaluation of a commercial DIR platform for contour propagation in prostate cancer patients treated with IMRT/VMAT.', 'Investigating CT to CBCT image registration for head and neck proton therapy as a tool for daily dose recalculation.', 'Automatic bladder segmentation on CBCT for multiple plan ART of bladder cancer using a patient-specific bladder model.', 'Deformable image registration for contour propagation from CT to cone-beam CT scans in radiotherapy of prostate cancer.', 'A review of cone-beam CT applications for adaptive radiotherapy of prostate cancer.', 'Evaluation of generalization ability for deep learning-based auto-segmentation accuracy in limited field of view CBCT of male pelvic region.', 'Autosegmentation of the rectum on megavoltage image guidance scans.', ""Applying physical science techniques and CERN technology to an unsolved problem in radiation treatment for cancer: the multidisciplinary 'VoxTox' research programme.""]"""

The process of commissioning IMNRT for clinical use is presented here. Results of commissioning tests are provided including validation measurements using representative patient plans as well as those from the TG-119 test suite.  Methods:   IMNRT plans were created using the Varian Eclipse optimization algorithm and an inhouse planning system for calculation of neutron dose distributions. Tissue equivalent ionization chambers and an ionization chamber array were used for point dose and planar dose distribution comparisons with calculated values. Validation plans were delivered to water and virtual water phantoms using TG-119 measurement points and evaluation techniques. Photon and neutron doses were evaluated both inside and outside the target volume for a typical IMNRT plan to determine effects of intensity modulation on the photon dose component. Monitor unit linearity and effects of beam current and gantry angle on output were investigated, and an independent validation of neutron dosimetry was obtained.  Results:   While IMNRT plan quality is superior to conventional fast neutron therapy plans for clinical sites such as prostate and head and neck, it is inferior to photon IMRT for most TG-119 planning goals, particularly for complex cases. This results significantly from current limitations on the number of segments. Measured and calculated doses for 11 representative plans (six prostate∕five head and neck) agreed to within -0.8 ± 1.4% and 5.0 ± 6.0% within and outside the target, respectively. Nearly all (22∕24) ion chamber point measurements in the two phantom arrangements were within the respective confidence intervals for the quantity [(measured-planned)∕prescription dose] derived in TG-119. Mean differences for all measurements were 0.5% (max = 7.0%) and 1.4% (max = 4.1%) in water and virtual water, respectively. The mean gamma pass rate for all cases was 92.8% (min = 88.6%). These pass rates are lower than typically achieved with photon IMRT, warranting development of a planar dosimetry system designed specifically for IMNRT and∕or the improvement of neutron beam modeling in the penumbral region. The fractional photon dose component did not change significantly in a typical IMNRT plan versus a conventional fast neutron therapy plan, and IMNRT delivery is not expected to significantly alter the RBE. All other commissioning results were considered satisfactory for clinical implementation of IMNRT, including the external neutron dose validation, which agreed with the predicted neutron dose to within 1%.  Conclusions:   IMNRT has been successfully commissioned for clinical use. While current plan quality is inferior to photon IMRT, it is superior to conventional fast neutron therapy. Ion chamber validation results for IMNRT commissioning are also comparable to those typically achieved with photon IMRT. Gamma pass rates for planar dose distributions are lower than typically observed for photon IMRT but may be improved with improved planar dosimetry equipment and beam modeling techniques. In the meantime, patient-specific quality assurance measurements should rely more heavily on point dose measurements with tissue equivalent ionization chambers. No significant technical impediments are anticipated in the clinical implementation of IMNRT as described here.""","""['Jay Burmeister', 'Robyn Spink', 'Liang Liang', 'Todd Bossenberger', 'Robert Halford', 'John Brandon', 'Jonathan Delauter', 'Michael Snyder']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Intensity modulated neutron radiotherapy optimization by photon proxy.', 'Dose escalation in prostate cancer using intensity modulated neutron radiotherapy.', 'Intensity modulated neutron radiotherapy for the treatment of adenocarcinoma of the prostate.', 'Dosimetry tools and techniques for IMRT.', 'Present status, trends and needs in fast neutron therapy.', 'Comparisons of 3-Dimensional Conformal and Intensity-Modulated Neutron Therapy for Head and Neck Cancers.', 'Fast Neutron Therapy for Breast Cancer Treatment: An Effective Technique Sinking into Oblivion.']"""

The performance of the system, including the accuracy and noise level with various tracking parameters and conditions, were investigated.  Methods:   A direct current (dc) EM transmitter (midrange model) and a sensor with diameter of 1.3 mm (Model 130) were used in the trakSTAR system for tracking catheter position during HDR prostate brachytherapy. Localization accuracy was assessed under both static and dynamic analyses conditions. For the static analysis, a calibration phantom was used to investigate error dependency on operating room (OR) table height (bottom vs midposition vs top), sensor position (distal tip of catheter vs connector end of catheter), direction [left-right (LR) vs anterior-posterior (AP) vs superior-inferior (SI)], sampling frequency (40 vs 80 vs 120 Hz), and interference from OR equipment (present vs absent). The mean and standard deviation of the localization offset in each direction and the corresponding error vectors were calculated. For dynamic analysis, the paths of five straight catheters were tracked to study the effects of directions, sampling frequency, and interference of EM field. Statistical analysis was conducted to compare the results in different configurations.  Results:   When interference was present in the static analysis, the error vectors were significantly higher at the top table position (3.3 ± 1.3 vs 1.8 ± 0.9 mm at bottom and 1.7 ± 1.0 mm at middle, p < 0.001), at catheter end position (3.1 ± 1.1 vs 1.4 ± 0.7 mm at the tip position, p < 0.001), and at 40 Hz sampling frequency (2.6 ± 1.1 vs 2.4 ± 1.5 mm at 80 Hz and 1.8 ± 1.1 at 160 Hz, p < 0.001). So did the mean offset errors in the LR direction (-1.7 ± 1.4 vs 0.4 ± 0.5 mm in AP and 0.8 ± 0.8 mm in SI directions, p < 0.001). The error vectors were significantly higher with surrounding interference (2.2 ± 1.3 mm) vs without interference (1.0 ± 0.7 mm, p < 0.001). An accuracy of 1.6 ± 0.2 mm can be reached when using optimum configuration (160 Hz at middle table position). When interference was present in the dynamic tracking, the mean tracking errors in LR direction (1.4 ± 0.5 mm) was significantly higher than that in AP direction (0.3 ± 0.2 mm, p < 0.001). So did the mean vector errors at 40 Hz (2.1 ± 0.2 mm vs 1.3 ± 0.2 mm at 80 Hz and 0.9 ± 0.2 mm at 160 Hz, p < 0.05). However, when interference was absent, they were comparable in the both directions and at all sampling frequencies. An accuracy of 0.9 ± 0.2 mm was obtained for the dynamic tracking when using optimum configuration.  Conclusions:   The performance of an EM tracking system depends highly on the system configuration and surrounding environment. The accuracy of EM tracking for catheter reconstruction in a prostate HDR brachytherapy procedure can be improved by reducing interference from surrounding equipment, decreasing distance from transmitter to tracking area, and choosing appropriated sampling frequency. A calibration scheme is needed to further reduce the tracking error when the interference is high.""","""['Jun Zhou', 'Evelyn Sebastian', 'Victor Mangona', 'Di Yan']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Electromagnetic tracking for catheter reconstruction in ultrasound-guided high-dose-rate brachytherapy of the prostate.', 'Improved electromagnetic tracking for catheter path reconstruction with application in high-dose-rate brachytherapy.', 'Fast, automatic, and accurate catheter reconstruction in HDR brachytherapy using an electromagnetic 3D tracking system.', 'The role of high-dose rate brachytherapy in locally advanced prostate cancer.', 'Performance and suitability assessment of a real-time 3D electromagnetic needle tracking system for interstitial brachytherapy.', 'Image-guided Raman spectroscopy navigation system to improve transperineal prostate cancer detection.

We provide guidelines for applying ROCO to larynx, oropharynx, and nasopharynx cases, and report the results of a live experiment that demonstrates how an expert planner can save several hours of trial-and-error interaction using the proposed approach.  Methods:   The ROCO method used for H&N IMRT planning consists of three major steps. First, the intensity space of treatment plans is sampled by solving a series of unconstrained optimization problems with a parameter range based on previously treated patient data. Second, the dominant modes in the intensity space are estimated by dimensionality reduction using principal component analysis (PCA). Third, a constrained optimization problem over this basis is quickly solved to find an IMRT plan that meets organ-at-risk (OAR) and target coverage constraints. The quality of the plan is assessed using evaluation tools within Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC)'s treatment planning system (TPS).  Results:   The authors generated ten H&N IMRT plans for previously treated patients using the ROCO method and processed them for deliverability by a dynamic multileaf collimator (DMLC). The authors quantitatively compared the ROCO plans to the previously achieved clinical plans using the TPS tools used at MSKCC, including DVH and isodose contour analysis, and concluded that the ROCO plans would be clinically acceptable. In our current implementation, ROCO H&N plans can be generated using about 1.6 h of offline computation followed by 5-15 min of semiautomatic planning time. Additionally, the authors conducted a live session for a plan designated by MSKCC performed together with an expert H&N planner. A technical assistant set up the first two steps, which were performed without further human interaction, and then collaborated in a virtual meeting with the expert planner to perform the third (constrained optimization) step. The expert planner performed in-depth analysis of the resulting ROCO plan and deemed it to be clinically acceptable and in some aspects superior to the clinical plan. This entire process took 135 min including two constrained optimization runs, in comparison to the estimated 4 h that would have been required using traditional clinical planning tools.  Conclusions:   The H&N site is very challenging for IMRT planning, due to several levels of prescription and a large, variable number (6-20) of OARs that depend on the location of the tumor. ROCO for H&N shows promise in generating clinically acceptable plans both more quickly and with substantially less human interaction.""","""['Linda Rivera', 'Ellen Yorke', 'Alex Kowalski', 'Jie Yang', 'Richard J Radke', 'Andrew Jackson']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Reduced order constrained optimization (ROCO): clinical application to lung IMRT.', 'Treatment plan comparison between helical tomotherapy and MLC-based IMRT using radiobiological measures.', 'Modeling the dosimetry of organ-at-risk in head and neck IMRT planning: an intertechnique and interinstitutional study.', 'Plan quality in radiotherapy treatment planning - Review of the factors and challenges.', 'Implementation of automatic plan optimization in Italy: Status and perspectives.', 'Automated inverse optimization facilitates lower doses to normal tissue in pancreatic stereotactic body radiotherapy.', 'A novel reduced-order prioritized optimization method for radiation therapy treatment planning.']"""

Robust optimization incorporates setup and range uncertainties, which implicitly adds margins to both targets and OARs and is also able to compensate for perturbations in dose distributions within targets and OARs caused by uncertainties. In contrast, the traditional PTV-based optimization considers only setup uncertainties and adds a margin only to targets but no margins to the OARs. It also ignores range uncertainty. The purpose of this work is to determine if robustly optimized plans are superior to PTV-based plans simply because the latter do not assign margins to OARs during optimization.  Methods:   The authors retrospectively selected from their institutional database five patients with head and neck (H&N) cancer and one with prostate cancer for this analysis. Using their original images and prescriptions, the authors created new IMPT plans using three methods: PTV-based optimization, optimization based on the PTV and planning risk volumes (PRVs) (i.e., ""PTV+PRV-based optimization""), and robust optimization using the ""worst-case"" dose distribution. The PRVs were generated by uniformly expanding OARs by 3 mm for the H&N cases and 5 mm for the prostate case. The dose-volume histograms (DVHs) from the worst-case dose distributions were used to assess and compare plan quality. Families of DVHs for each uncertainty for all structures of interest were plotted along with the nominal DVHs. The width of the ""bands"" of DVHs was used to quantify the plan sensitivity to uncertainty.  Results:   Compared with conventional PTV-based and PTV+PRV-based planning, robust optimization led to a smaller bandwidth for the targets in the face of uncertainties {clinical target volume [CTV] bandwidth: 0.59 [robust], 3.53 [PTV+PRV], and 3.53 [PTV] Gy (RBE)}. It also resulted in higher doses to 95% of the CTV {D(95%): 60.8 [robust] vs 59.3 [PTV+PRV] vs 59.6 [PTV] Gy (RBE)}, smaller D(5%) (doses to 5% of the CTV) minus D(95%) {D(5%) - D(95%): 13.2 [robust] vs 17.5 [PTV+PRV] vs 17.2 [PTV] Gy (RBE)}. At the same time, the robust optimization method irradiated OARs less {maximum dose to 1 cm(3) of the brainstem: 48.3 [robust] vs 48.8 [PTV+PRV] vs 51.2 [PTV] Gy (RBE); mean dose to the oral cavity: 22.3 [robust] vs 22.9 [PTV+PRV] vs 26.1 [PTV] Gy (RBE); maximum dose to 1% of the normal brain: 66.0 [robust] vs 68.0 [PTV+PRV] vs 69.3 [PTV] Gy (RBE)}.  Conclusions:   For H&N cases studied, OAR sparing in PTV+PRV-based optimization was inferior compared to robust optimization but was superior compared to PTV-based optimization; however, target dose robustness and homogeneity were comparable in the PTV+PRV-based and PTV-based optimizations. The same pattern held for the prostate case. The authors' data suggest that the superiority of robust optimization is not due simply to its inclusion of margins for OARs, but that this is due mainly to the ability of robust optimization to compensate for perturbations in dose distributions within target volumes and normal tissues caused by uncertainties.""","""['Wei Liu', 'Steven J Frank', 'Xiaoqiang Li', 'Yupeng Li', 'Ron X Zhu', 'Radhe Mohan']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['SU-E-T-624: Comparison of PTV+PRV-Based Optimization and Robust Optimization in Intensity-Modulated Proton Therapy.', 'Effectiveness of robust optimization in intensity-modulated proton therapy planning for head and neck cancers.', 'Comparison of linear and nonlinear programming approaches for ""worst case dose"" and ""minmax"" robust optimization of intensity-modulated proton therapy dose distributions.', 'Robust optimization in lung treatment plans accounting for geometric uncertainty.', 'Treatment planning optimisation in proton therapy.', 'Evaluating large language models on a highly-specialized topic, radiation oncology physics.', 'Validation of robust radiobiological optimization algorithms based on the mixed beam model for intensity-modulated carbon-ion therapy.', 'Beam mask and sliding window-facilitated deep learning-based accurate and efficient dose prediction for pencil beam scanning proton therapy.', 'Deep-Learning-based Fast and Accurate 3D CT Deformable Image Registration in Lung Cancer.', 'Dosimetric comparison of robust angles in carbon-ion radiation therapy for prostate cancer.']"""

Methods:   Phantoms, consisting of water, contrast agent, and agarose, were manufactured. The volume was measured using 3D US, CT, and MR devices. A CT-3D US and MR-3D US image fusion software was developed using the Insight Toolkit library in order to acquire three-dimensional fusion images. The quality of the image fusion was evaluated using metric value and fusion images.  Results:   Volume measurement, using 3D US, shows a 2.8 ± 1.5% error, 4.4 ± 3.0% error for CT, and 3.1 ± 2.0% error for MR.

Methods:   Medical records for 1268 patients undergoing open radical prostatectomy between January 2000 and December 2009 who had not undergone neoadjuvant therapy were retrospectively reviewed. Patients with low-risk disease (n = 222; prostate-specific antigen <10 ng/mL, biopsy Gleason score ≤6, clinical T1c or T2a) were classified according to whether they underwent pelvic lymph node dissection (pelvic lymph node dissection group, n = 147) or did not (no pelvic lymph node dissection group, n = 75). Pelvic lymph node dissection was carried out in a limited style, which included the external iliac vein and the obturator fossa. The incidence of lymph node invasion was determined and referred to the preoperative nomogram developed for Japanese patients (Japanese nomogram), Partin and Kattan nomograms. The 5-year biochemical recurrence-free survivals in both groups were analyzed.  Results:   Lymph node invasion in low-, intermediate- and high-risk disease was 0.7% (1/147), 1.2% (7/595) and 6.1% (23/374). The 5-year biochemical recurrence-free survival rates for patients with low-risk disease were 87.6% in the pelvic lymph node dissection group and 87.1% in the no pelvic lymph node dissection group (P = 0.65, log-rank). No patients in the pelvic lymph node dissection group exceeded 2% of lymph node invasion risk with Japanese and Partin nomograms. With the Kattan nomogram, 22.4% (33/147) of the pelvic lymph node dissection group exceeded 2% of lymph node invasion risk, and one patient had documented lymph node invasion, but none exceeded 2.5%.

Herein we describe a novel method for the treatment of this complication.  Methods:   Intervention for a prolonged or massive anastomotic urine leak was required in 10 out of 1828 patients (0.5%) submitted to radical prostatectomy between 2007 and 2011. N-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate (Histoacryl) followed by fibrin glue (Greenplast) were injected under local anesthesia into vesicourethral anastomotic gaps under fluoroscopic guidance using a 20-Fr rigid cystoscope. Cystograms were taken in all patients to confirm complete urine leak resolution before the removal of the urethral catheter.  Results:   Cystoscopic injection of Histoacryl followed by fibrin glue was technically successful and well tolerated in all patients. The mean time from radical prostatectomy to glue injection was 16.0 days (range 12-27 days). Urethral catheterization was required for an average of 7.7 days after cystoscopic injection of fibrin glue (range 3-13 days). These measures ultimately enabled complete resolution of the urine leak in all cases. At a mean follow up of 23.3 months, all 10 patients were fully continent. The mean time to recovery of urinary continence was 20.4 weeks (range 3.9-60.0 weeks).

The present discrepancy at gene level indicates a need for a novel strategy to obtain more robust signatures for cancer. In this paper we hypothesize that (1) the expression signatures of different cancer microarray datasets are more similar at pathway level than at gene level; (2) the comparability of the cancer molecular mechanisms of different individuals is related to their genetic similarities. In support of the hypotheses, we summarized theoretical and experimental evidences, and conducted case studies on colorectal and prostate cancer microarray datasets. Based on the above assumption, we propose that reliable cancer signatures should be investigated in the context of biological pathways, within a cohort of genetically homogeneous population.

The continued high-level expression of PSA by the majority of men with both high- and low-grade prostate cancer throughout the course of disease progression, even in the androgen-ablated state, suggests that PSA has a role in the pathogenesis of disease. Current experimental and clinical evidence suggests that chronic inflammation, regardless of the cause, may predispose men to prostate cancer. The responsibility of the immune system in immune surveillance and eventually tumor progression is well appreciated but not completely understood. In this study, we used a mass spectrometry-based evaluation of prostatic fluid obtained from diseased prostates after removal by radical prostatectomy to identify potential immunoregulatory proteins. This analysis revealed the presence of Igs and the complement system proteins C3, factor B, and clusterin. Verification of these findings by Western blot confirmed the high-level expression of C3 in the prostatic fluid and the presence of a previously uncharacterized C-terminal C3 cleavage product. Biochemical analysis of this C3 cleavage fragment revealed a putative PSA cleavage site after tyrosine-1348. Purified PSA was able to cleave iC3b and the related complement protein C5.

Methods:   Using data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) -Medicare database, we examined comorbid condition quality of care in patients with locoregional breast, prostate, or colorectal cancer diagnosed in 2004 who were age ≥ 66 years at diagnosis, who had survived ≥ 3 years, and who were enrolled in fee-for-service Medicare. Controls were frequency matched to cases on age, sex, race, and region. Quality of care was assessed from day 366 through day 1,095 postdiagnosis using published indicators of chronic (n = 10) and acute (n = 19) condition care. The proportion of eligible cancer survivors and controls who received recommended care was compared by using Fisher's exact tests. The chronic and acute indicators, respectively, were then combined into single logistic regression models for each cancer type to compare survivors' care receipt to that of controls, adjusting for clinical and sociodemographic variables and controlling for within-patient variation.  Results:   The sample matched 8,661 cancer survivors to 17,322 controls (mean age, 75 years; 65% male; 85% white).

However, whether this association is different as a function of race is unclear. In the current study, the authors attempted to characterize the link between exercise and prostate cancer (CaP) in white and black American men.  Methods:   Using a prospective design, 307 men (164 of whom were white and 143 of whom were black) who were undergoing prostate biopsy completed a self-reported survey that assessed exercise behavior (metabolic equivalent [MET] hours per week). Crude and adjusted logistic regression analyses were used to estimate the risk of prostate cancer controlling for age, body mass index, digital rectal examination findings, previous biopsy, Charlson comorbidity score, and family history of CaP stratified by self-reported race.  Results:   There was no significant difference noted with regard to the amount of exercise between racial groups (P = .12). Higher amounts of MET hours per week were associated with a decreased risk of CaP for white men in both crude (P = .02) and adjusted (P = .04) regression models. Among whites, men who exercised ≥ 9 MET hours per week were less likely to have a positive biopsy result compared with men exercising < 9 MET hours per week (odds ratio, 0.47; 95% confidence interval, 0.22-0.99 [P = .047]).

However, it is still unknown whether men who have a history of myocardial infarction (MI) or MI risk factors achieve a superior outcome from HT.  Methods:   A Markov decision analysis model was used to compare quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE) in men aged 50, 60, and 70 years who received RT and no HT, 6 months of HT (short-term), or 3 years of HT (long-term) for high-risk prostate cancer stratified by cardiac risk group.  Results:   In men with a history of MI, there was a decrease of 0.1 to 0.2 quality-adjusted life years and 0.5 to 0.6 quality-adjusted life years across all ages with short-term HT and long-term HT, respectively, compared with no HT. In men without MI, receipt of short-term or long-term HT was associated with a QALE benefit versus no HT in all cohorts. Among men without MI, the optimal duration of HT was a function of age and the number of MI risk factors. Long-term HT improved QALE (range, 1.4-5.4 years) for men aged 50 or 60 years except those with MI; whereas, for men aged 70 years with 4 cardiac risk factors, short-term and long-term HT yielded identical QALE.  Conclusions:   Men who received RT for high-risk prostate cancer and had a history of MI experienced net harm when they received HT.

Objective:   To determine the effects of different methods of helping men consider such values.  Design and setting:   Randomized trial from October 12 to 27, 2011, in the general community.  Participants:   A total of 911 men aged 50 to 70 years from the United States and Australia who had average risk. Participants were drawn from online panels from a survey research firm in each country and were randomized by the survey firm to 1 of 3 values clarification methods: a balance sheet (n = 302), a rating and ranking task (n = 307), or a discrete choice experiment (n = 302).  Intervention:   Participants underwent a values clarification task and then chose the most important attribute.  Main outcome measures:   The main outcome was the difference among groups in the most important attribute. Secondary outcomes were differences in unlabeled test preference and intent to undergo screening with PSA.  Results:   The mean age was 59.8 years; most participants were white and more than one-third had graduated from college. More than 40% reported a PSA test within 12 months. The participants who received the rating and ranking task were more likely to report reducing the chance of death from prostate cancer as being most important (54.4%) compared with those who received the balance sheet (35.1%) or the discrete choice experiment (32.5%) (P < .001). Those receiving the balance sheet were more likely (43.7%) to prefer the unlabeled PSA-like option (as opposed to the ""no screening""-like option) compared with those who received rating and ranking (34.2%) or the discrete choice experiment (20.2%). However, the proportion who intended to undergo PSA testing was high and did not differ between groups (balance sheet, 77.1%; rating and ranking, 76.8%; and discrete choice experiment, 73.5%; P = .73).  Conclusions and relevance:   Different values clarification methods produce different patterns of attribute importance and different preferences for screening when presented with an unlabeled choice.

Lumican, a small leucine-rich proteoglycan (SLRP) of the extracellular matrix (ECM), regulates collagen fibrillogenesis. Recently, lumican has also been shown to regulate cell behavior during embryonic development, tissue repair and tumor progression. The role of lumican in cancer varies according to the type of tumor. In this study we analyze the role of lumican in the pathogenesis of prostate cancer both in vivo and in vitro. Overall lumican up-regulation was observed in the primary tumors analyzed through both real-time PCR and immunostaining. The increase in lumican expression was observed in the reactive stroma surrounding prostate primary tumors with fibrotic deposition surrounding the acinar glands. In vitro analysis demonstrated that lumican inhibited both the migration and invasion of metastatic prostate cancer cells isolated from lymph node, bone and brain. Moreover, prostate cancer cells seeded on lumican presented a decrease in the formation of cellular projections, lamellipodia detected by a decreased rearrangement in ZO-1, keratin 8/18, integrin β1 and MT1-MMP, and invadopodia detected by disruption of α-smooth muscle actin, cortactin and N-WASP. Moreover, a significant increase in prostate cancer cell invasion was observed through the peritoneum of lumican knockout mice, further demonstrating the restrictive role lumican present in the ECM has on prostate cancer invasion. In conclusion, lumican present in the reactive stroma surrounding prostate primary tumors plays a restrictive role on cancer progression, and we therefore postulate that lumican could be a valuable marker in prostate cancer staging.""","""['Vivien J Coulson-Thomas', 'Yvette M Coulson-Thomas', 'Tarsis F Gesteira', 'Claudia A Andrade de Paula', 'Celia R W Carneiro', 'Valdemar Ortiz', 'Leny Toma', 'Winston W-Y Kao', 'Helena B Nader']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Exp Cell Res""","""['Effects of the extracellular matrix on lumican expression in rat aortic smooth muscle cells in vitro.', 'Lumican core protein inhibits melanoma cell migration via alterations of focal adhesion complexes.', 'Different expression levels of lumican in human carcinoid tumor and neuroendocrine cell carcinoma.', 'Functions of lumican and fibromodulin: lessons from knockout mice.', 'Role of the small leucine-rich proteoglycan (SLRP) family in pathological lesions and cancer cell growth.', 'The Landscape of Small Leucine-Rich Proteoglycan Impact on Cancer Pathogenesis with a Focus on Biglycan and Lumican.', 'Identifying new biomarkers of aggressive Group\xa03 and SHH medulloblastoma using 3D hydrogel models, single cell RNA sequencing and 3D OrbiSIMS imaging.', 'Glycosylation Changes in Prostate Cancer Progression.', 'Extracellular matrix guidance of autophagy: a mechanism regulating cancer growth.', 'Assessment of Ovarian Tumor Growth in Wild-Type and Lumican-Deficient Mice: Insights Using Infrared Spectral Imaging, Histopathology, and Immunohistochemistry.']"""

As a result, radiobiological investigations are being carried out to determine the effect of these higher dose-rates on cell response. The studies reported thus far have presented conflicting results, highlighting the need for further investigation. To determine the radiobiological impact of the increased dose-rates from FFF exposures a Varian Truebeam medical linear accelerator was used to irradiate two human cancer cell lines in vitro, DU-145 prostate and H460 non-small cell lung, with both flattened and FFF 6 MV beams. The fluence profile of the FFF beam was modified using a custom-designed Nylon compensator to produce a similar dose profile to the flattened beam (6X) at the cell surface but at a higher instantaneous dose-rate. For both cell lines there appeared to be no significant change in cell survival. Curve fitting coefficients for DU145 cells irradiated with constant average dose-rates were 6X: α = 0.09 ± 0.03, β = 0.03 ± 0.01 and 6FFF: α = 0.14 ± 0.13, β = 0.03 ± 0.02 with a significance of p = 0.75. For H460 cells irradiated with the same instantaneous dose-rate but different average dose-rate the fit coefficients were 6FFF (low dose-rate): α = 0.21 ± 0.11, 0.07 ± 0.02 and 6FFF (high dose-rate): α = 0.21 ± 0.16, 0.07 ± 0.03, with p = 0.79.

Methods:   This study consisted of 11 541 men with coronary heart disease screened to participate in a secondary cardiac prevention trial. MS was defined according to modified NCEP/ATP III criteria. Multivariable regression analysis accounting for competing risks was performed using a modified Cox proportional hazard model in order to assess the association between diabetes, the MS and the subsequent development of prostate cancer.  Results:   At baseline, subjects were classified into one of the four groups: (1) 6119 (53%) with neither diabetic mellitus nor MS, (2) 3376 (29%) with the MS but without diabetes, (3) 560 (5%) with diabetes mellitus but without MS and (4) 1486 (13%) with both conditions. Median follow-up was 12.7 years (range 0-15.7 years). During follow-up, 459 new cases of prostate cancer were recorded. The age-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for prostate cancer was reduced in diabetic patients compared with those without diabetes, 0.54 and 95% confidence interval of 0.40-0.73. No significant association was noted between the presence of MS and prostate cancer development. On multivariate analysis, diabetes mellitus continued to protect against the development of prostate cancer, this was more pronounced in the absence of MS (HR=0.43, P=0.01 for diabetes in the absence of MS; HR=0.64, P=0.08 in the presence of MS).

Methods:   We used the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System 2010 data set to analyze geographic variability (by state) and its associated predictors in receiving a PSA test and/or a digital rectal examination (DRE). The study population consisted of men aged ≥50 years who responded as yes/no when asked about having a PSA test or DRE performed during the last year. We build two multilevel logistic regression models, differing in dependent variables, that is, (1) any prostate cancer screening (PCS) (either PSA and/or DRE), and (2) PCS based on PSA testing (PSAT). Individual characteristics (age, education, employment, marriage, income, race/ethnicity, self-reported health status, obesity, alcohol consumption, smoking status, personal physician presence, and health insurance coverage) were treated as level-1 variables and state characteristics (number of doctors per 100 000 persons per state, US regions and metropolitan statistical area (MSA) codes) were treated as level-2 variables.  Results:   We found significant geographic variability in receiving PCS and PSAT screening in the United States. For PCS, MSA code was an independent predictor, with men living in urban areas having lower odds of screening (odds ratio (OR)=0.8, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.7-0.9). In PSAT, the number of doctors per 100 000 persons per state was an independent predictor, with lowest quartile states (0-25% quartile) having lower odds of PSA-based screening (OR=0.78, 95% CI=063-0.94). In both models, all level-1 variables were independent predictors (P<0.05) of PCS, except self-reported health status.

Materials and methods:   We examined prostate cancer treatment patterns before and after conversion of a urology practice to an integrated prostate cancer center in July 2006. Using the SEER (Statistics, Epidemiology and End Results)-Medicare database, we identified patients 65 years old or older in 1 statewide registry diagnosed with nonmetastatic prostate cancer between 2004 and 2007. We classified patients into 3 groups, including 1--those seen by integrated prostate cancer center physicians (exposure group), 2--those living in the same hospital referral region who were not seen by integrated prostate cancer center physicians (hospital referral region control group) and 3--those living elsewhere in the state (state control group). We compared changes in treatment among the 3 groups, adjusting for patient, clinical and socioeconomic factors.  Results:   Compared with the 8.1 ppt increase in adjusted intensity modulated radiation therapy use in the state control group, the use of this therapy increased 20.3 ppts (95% CI 13.4, 27.1) in the integrated prostate cancer center group and 19.2 ppts (95% CI 9.6, 28.9) in the hospital referral region control group. Androgen deprivation therapy, for which Medicare reimbursement decreased sharply, similarly decreased in integrated prostate cancer center and hospital referral region controls. Prostatectomy decreased significantly in the integrated prostate cancer center group.  Conclusions:   Coincident with the conversion of a urology group practice to an integrated prostate cancer center, we observed an increase in intensity modulated radiation therapy and a decrease in androgen deprivation therapy in patients seen by integrated prostate cancer center physicians and those seen in the surrounding health care market that were not observed in the remainder of the state.""","""['Justin E Bekelman', 'Gita Suneja', 'Thomas Guzzo', 'Craig Evan Pollack', 'Katrina Armstrong', 'Andrew J Epstein']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Physician visits prior to treatment for clinically localized prostate cancer.', ""United States radiation oncologists' and urologists' opinions about screening and treatment of prostate cancer vary by region."", 'Comparison of recommendations by urologists and radiation oncologists for treatment of clinically localized prostate cancer.', 'The role of androgen ablation in patients with biochemical or local failure after definitive radiation therapy: a survey of practice patterns of urologists and radiation oncologists in the United States.', 'Avoiding obsolescence in advanced prostate cancer management: a guide for urologists.', ""The Influence of Practice Structure on Urologists' Treatment of Men With Low-Risk Prostate Cancer."", 'Multidisciplinary clinics in prostate cancer.', 'Urology Workforce Changes and Implications for Prostate Cancer Care Among Medicare Enrollees.', 'Quality criteria in urology : How to obtain comparable results?.', 'Practice-Level Adoption of Conservative Management for Prostate Cancer.']"""

Recent reports have indicated that fenofibrate exerts anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic properties.

The effects of fenofibrate on LNCaP cells were evaluated by flow cytometry, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, Western blot analysis, and dual-luciferase reporter assay. Fenofibrate induces cell cycle arrest in G1 phase and apoptosis in LNCaP cells, reduces the expressions of androgen receptor (AR) and AR target genes (prostate-specific antigen and TMPRSS2), and inhibits Akt phosphorylation. Fenofibrate can induce the accumulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species and malondialdehyde, and decrease the activities of total anti-oxidant and superoxide dismutase in LNCaP cells.

This enzyme is a marker of cell proliferation in normal and neoplastic tissues; however, little information is available about its expression in prostate cancer (PCa).  Methods:   Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was automated using mouse monoclonal antibody against TOP2A (clone SWT3D1; DAKO, Carpenteria, CA, USA) at dilution 1:800 and Flex Plus detection system in autostainer 48Ultra (DAKO). FISH was performed using TOP2A (17q21)/ CEP17 probe kit (Kreateck Biotechnology, San Diego, CA, USA). Biochemical and pathological data from 193 patients with PCa were retrieved for the analysis, whose significance was considered when p < 0.05. Also, fractal analysis was performed in a subset of 20 randomly selected cases.  Results:   TOP2A protein expression correlated with higher Gleason scores and higher levels of preoperative PSA (p = 0.018 and p = 0.011). Patients with higher levels of TOP2A presented shorter biochemical recurrence-free survival (BRFS) (p = 0.001). In multivariate analysis, we found that TOP2A remained an independent prognostic factor of BRFS, with a relative risk of 1.98 (p = 0.001; 95% CI, 1.338-2.93); thus, cases that expressed high levels of this enzyme had a shorter BRFS compared with TOP2A-negative or TOP2A-low cases. No alterations in TOP2A gene status nor correlation between FISH and IHC results were observed. Concerning fractal analysis, patients who expressed higher levels of TOP2A have angiolymphatic invasion and presented higher Gleason scores (p = 0.033 and p = 0.025, respectively). Also, patients with higher expression of TOP2A presented shorter BRFS (p = 0.001).  Conclusions:   This is the first study to perform TOP2A protein and gene digital assessment and fractal analysis in association with BRFS in a large series of PCa. Also, we show that TOP2A gene copy number alterations are not observed in this type of tumor. So, higher protein expression of TOP2A is not related to gene amplification in PCa. Furthermore, TOP2A protein assessment has prognostic importance and, due to its relation with poor outcome, TOP2A IHC evaluation in the biopsy can represent an important tool for selecting the most suitable surgical and clinical approach for patients with PCa.""","""['Marina França de Resende', 'Samantha Vieira', 'Ludmilla Thomé Domingos Chinen', 'Francesco Chiappelli', 'Francisco Paulo da Fonseca', 'Gustavo Cardoso Guimarães', 'Fernando Augusto Soares', 'Ivan Neves', 'Simone Pagotty', 'Peter A Pellionisz', 'Andre Barkhordarian', 'Xenia Brant', 'Rafael Malagoli Rocha']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Transl Med""","""['Evaluation of the prognostic role of centromere 17 gain and HER2/topoisomerase II alpha gene status and protein expression in patients with breast cancer treated with anthracycline-containing adjuvant chemotherapy: pooled analysis of two Hellenic Cooperative Oncology Group (HeCOG) phase III trials.', 'Analysis of ERBB2 and TOP2A gene status using fluorescence in situ hybridization versus immunohistochemistry in localized breast cancer.', 'Abnormality of TOP2A expression and its gene copy number variations in neuroblastic tumors.', 'Assessment of Topoisomerase II α status in breast cancer by quantitative PCR, gene expression microarrays, immunohistochemistry, and fluorescence in situ hybridization.', 'Triple negative breast cancer--current status and prospective targeted treatment based on HER1 (EGFR), TOP2A and C-MYC gene assessment.', 'BAZ2A-RNA mediated association with TOP2A and KDM1A represses genes implicated in prostate cancer.', 'Exploring the hub genes and mechanisms of Daphne altaica treating esophageal squamous cell carcinoma based on network pharmacology and bioinformatics analysis.', 'A machine learning framework develops a DNA replication stress model for predicting clinical outcomes and therapeutic vulnerability in primary prostate cancer.', 'Chemotherapy- and Immune-Related Gene Panel in Prognosis Prediction and Immune Microenvironment of SCLC.', 'Knockdown of NUSAP1 inhibits cell proliferation and invasion through downregulation of TOP2A in human glioblastoma.']"""

Objective:   To determine whether long-term PSAV improves classification of PCa risk and mortality in the general population.  Design, setting, and participants:   We studied 503 men aged 30-80 yr, with and without PCa, who had repeated PSA measurements over 20 yr and up to 28 yr before PCa diagnosis. These were selected from among 7455 men in the Copenhagen City Heart Study, a prospective, general population study with follow-up from 1981 through 2010. Results were subsequently applied to all 1 351 441 men aged 40-80 yr living in Denmark from 1997 through 2006.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   PCa risk and mortality were assessed using Cox regression. Improvement in risk classification was assessed using the net reclassification index (NRI).  Results:   Age-adjusted hazard ratios for PCa risk and mortality were 2.7-5.3 and 2.3-3.4, respectively, for long-term PSAV when added to models already including baseline PSA values. For PCa risk and mortality, adding long-term PSAV to models already including baseline PSA values and age yielded continuous NRIs of 98-99% and 56-106%, respectively. Used on a nationwide scale (eg, for men aged 60-64 yr), long-term PSAV >0.35 versus ≤ 0.35 ng/ml per year appropriately reclassified 128 of 10 000 men with PCa and 8095 of 10 000 men with no PCa. Correspondingly, inappropriately reclassified were 49 of 10 000 men with PCa and 1658 of 10 000 men with no PCa.  Conclusions:   Long-term PSAV in addition to baseline PSA value improves classification of PCa risk and mortality. Applying long-term PSAV nationwide, the ratio of appropriately to inappropriately classified men would typically be 5:1.""","""['David D Ørsted', 'Stig E Bojesen', 'Pia R Kamstrup', 'Børge G Nordestgaard']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Prostate-specific antigen velocity: new methods, same results, still no evidence of clinical utility.', 'Reply from Authors re: Andrew J.

Only a few studies have previously been performed on the validity of the LENT/SOMA. The aim of the present study was to validate the LENT/SOMA scoring system for recto-anal side effects after treatment for prostate cancer in a randomized trial.  Material and methods:   A total of 875 patients with locally advanced prostate cancer were randomized to either hormonal treatment alone or hormonal treatment plus radiotherapy in the Scandinavian Prostate Cancer Group 7 (SPCG-7) study. At least three years after treatment was started, the 178 patients that were randomized at St. Olavs Hospital were approached. One hundred and three patients of these accepted inclusion. The side effects according to LENT/SOMA were graded by oncologist and nurse. In addition, side effects were graded according to the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer and the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (EORTC/RTOG) toxicity scale and patient-reported health-related quality of life (HRQOL) questionnaires. Content/face validity, sensitivity and inter-rater reliability of the LENT/SOMA tables for rectum were analyzed.  Results:   Content/face analysis of LENT/SOMA revealed serious problems. Significant correlations (Spearman's rho > 0.4) were found between three of 15 LENT/SOMA items and similar HRQOL items. LENT/SOMA score made it possible to detect significant differences between the two groups of patients (p < 0.001), EORTC/RTOG toxicity score did not (p = 0.138). Inter-rater reliability was acceptable.  Conclusions:   LENT/SOMA scoring system for recto-anal side effects after radiotherapy for prostate cancer displays serious difficulties in the present study.

Methods:   We further evaluated this G84E missense mutation (rs138213197) in two genetic association studies of prostate cancer: a family-based study of brothers and a case-control study of more aggressive disease (N = 2,665 total). We then calculated overall impact of this mutation by pooling all published studies of European-Americans.  Results:   In our studies, the mutation was found exclusively among men with prostate cancer (carrier frequency = 1.48%) or unaffected brothers of cases carrying the mutation (frequency = 0.34%), and carrying the mutation gave an OR for disease = 4.79 (P = 0.01). The G84E mutation was more common among men with an earlier age of onset (≤55 years) or a family history of prostate cancer. We also observed for the first time an African-American case carrying the G84E mutation, although at HOXB13 both of his chromosomes were of European-American ancestry. The pooled analysis also indicated that carrying the G84E mutation results in an almost five-fold increase in risk of prostate cancer (P = 3.5 × 10(-17)), and this risk is even higher among cases with an early age of prostate cancer onset (≤55 years) or a family history of disease: a test of heterogeneity across these strata gives P < 1 × 10(-5).  Conclusions:   The HOXB13 mutation substantially increases risk of early onset, familial prostate cancer in European-American men.

This within-individual variability, coupled with technical variability, reduces the power for epidemiologic studies to detect associations with disease. Here, the authors assess the variability of a large subset of metabolites and evaluate the implications for epidemiologic studies.  Methods:   Using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) and gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC/MS) platforms, 385 metabolites were measured in 60 women at baseline and year-one of the Shanghai Physical Activity Study, and observed patterns were confirmed in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening study.  Results:   Although the authors found high technical reliability (median intraclass correlation = 0.8), reliability over time within an individual was low. Taken together, variability in the assay and variability within the individual accounted for the majority of variability for 64% of metabolites. Given this, a metabolite would need, on average, a relative risk of 3 (comparing upper and lower quartiles of ""usual"" levels) or 2 (comparing quartiles of observed levels) to be detected in 38%, 74%, and 97% of studies including 500, 1,000, and 5,000 individuals. Age, gender, and fasting status factors, which are often of less interest in epidemiologic studies, were associated with 30%, 67%, and 34% of metabolites, respectively, but the associations were weak and explained only a small proportion of the total metabolite variability.

All mice were injected 4-6 weeks after xenograft implantation with 37 MBq [¹¹C]choline via the tail vein. Dynamic imaging was performed for 60 minutes with a small-animal PET/CT scanner. After the first [¹¹C]choline PET/CT imaging 8 mice were subsequently injected intravenously with docetaxel twice (days 1 and 5) at a dose of 3 mg/kg body weight. 8 mice were treated with PBS as a control. [¹¹C]choline PET/CT imaging was performed on day 7, 14 and 21 after treatment. Image analysis was performed using tumor/muscle (T/M) ratios (ROI(T)/ROI(M) = T/M ratio).  Results:   All LNCaP tumours could be visualized by [¹¹C]choline PET/CT. Before treatment the mean T/M ratio was 2.0 ± 0.2 in the docetaxel-treated group and 1.9 ± 0.2 in the control group (p = 0.837).

Recently, using a fragment-based approach and X-ray crystallography, we reported on the design and synthesis of novel Rho-kinase inhibitors (RKIs). Here, we selected a pair of RKIs, the closely related structural analogs RKI-18 (potent; IC50 values of 397 nM (ROCK1) and 349 nM (ROCK2)) and RKI-11 (weak/inactive; IC50 values of 38 μM (ROCK1) and 45 μM (ROCK2)), as chemical probes and determined their effects on cytoskeleton organization, signaling, apoptosis, anchorage-dependent and independent growth, migration and invasion. RKI-18 but not RKI-11 suppresses potently the phosphorylation of the ROCK substrate myosin light chain 2 (MLC2) in intact human breast, lung, colon and prostate cancer cells. Furthermore, RKI-18 is highly selective at decreasing the levels of P-MLC2 over those of P-Akt, P-S6 and P-Erk ½. RKI-18 suppresses ROCK-mediated actin fiber formation, following stimulation with LPA as well as p21-activated kinase (PAK)-mediated lamellipodia and filopodia formation following bradykinin or PDGF stimulation. Furthermore, RKI-18 but not RKI-11 inhibits migration, invasion and anchorage-independent growth of human breast cancer cells. The fact that the active ROCK inhibitor RKI-18, but not the inactive closely related structural analog RKI-11 is effective at suppressing malignant transformation suggests that inhibition of ROCK with RKI-18 results in preventing migration, invasion and anchorage-independent growth.

We present the largest series of men with high-risk, Gleason pattern 5 prostate cancer treated with permanent interstitial brachytherapy and XRT.  Methods and materials:   Between April 1995 and December 2008, 329 consecutive patients with National Comprehensive Cancer Network high-risk disease were treated with permanent interstitial brachytherapy. Most received XRT and ADT. Median followup was 7.2 years. The cause of death was determined for each deceased patient. Multiple clinical, treatment, and dosimetric parameters were evaluated for impact on the evaluated survival parameters.  Results:   At 10 years, biochemical progression-free survival, cause-specific survival (CSS), and overall survival for the group of high-risk patients as a whole was 91.1%, 95.5%, and 72.5%, respectively.

Then, we evaluated the prognostic significance of concomitant extracapsular extension (ECE) in patients with seminal vesicle invasion and negative lymph nodes at radical prostatectomy.  Methods:   We identified 1,132 patients who underwent prostatectomy between 1987 and 2009 and were found to have pT3bN0 disease. Median postoperative follow-up was 10.6 years (interquartile range, 5.9-15.3). Survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared for patients with and without ECE with the log-rank test. The association of ECE with outcome was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression models.  Results:   A total of 693 (61%) patients were noted to have ECE. Compared with pT3bN0 patients without ECE, patients with pT3bN0 tumors and ECE had a significantly worse 15-year biochemical recurrence-free survival (29% vs. 39%; P<0.001), systemic progression-free survival (71% vs. 81%; P<0.001), cancer-specific survival (80% vs. 89%; P<0.001), and overall survival (50% vs. 63%; P<0.001). On multivariate analysis, the presence of ECE was associated with significantly increased risks of systemic progression (hazard ratio [HR], 1.56; P=0.006), death from prostate cancer (HR, 1.71; P=0.01), and all-cause mortality (HR, 1.35; P=0.007). Meanwhile, adjuvant hormonal therapy, which was received by 334 patients (29.5%), was associated with significantly decreased risks of systemic progression (HR, 0.50; P=0.0004) and cancer death (HR, 0.57; P=0.03), but not all-cause mortality (HR, 0.81; P=0.09). Limitations included retrospective design and nonstandardized application of secondary treatments.  Conclusions:   The presence of ECE in patients with pT3bN0 prostate cancer is associated with increased risks of systemic progression and cancer death.

This proof-of-principle study demonstrates the use of a method called herein 'stochastic triangulation' for this purpose. Stochastic triangulation uses very short imaging arcs and a few projections.  Materials and methods:   A stochastic Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimator is proposed based on an uncertainty-driven model of the acquisition geometry and inter-/intra-fractional deformable anatomy. The application of this method was designed to use the available linac-mounted cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) and/or electronic portal imaging devices (EPID) for the patient setup based on short imaging arcs. For the proof-of-principle clinical demonstration, the MAP estimator was applied to 5 CBCT scans of a prostate cancer patient with 2 implanted gold markers. Estimation was performed for several (18) very short imaging arcs of 5° with 10 projections resulting in 90 estimations.  Results:   Short-arc stochastic triangulation led to residual radial errors compared to manual inspection with a mean value of 1.4mm and a standard deviation of 0.9 mm (median 1.2mm, maximum 3.8mm) averaged over imaging directions all around the patient. Furthermore, abrupt intra-fractional motion of up to 10mm resulted in radial errors with a mean value of 1.8mm and a standard deviation of 1.1mm (median 1.5mm, maximum 5.6mm). Slow periodic intra-fractional motions in the range of 12 mm resulted in radial errors with a mean value of 1.8mm and a standard deviation of 1.1mm (median 1.6mm, maximum 4.7 mm).  Conclusion:   Based on this study, the proposed stochastic method is fast, robust and can be used for inter- as well as intra-fractional target localization using current CBCT units.""","""['Wolfgang Hoegele', 'Rainer Loeschel', 'Barbara Dobler', 'Oliver Koelbl', 'Clair Beard', 'Piotr Zygmanski']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Radiother Oncol""","""['Localization of deformable tumors from short-arc projections using Bayesian estimation.', 'Correction of patient positioning errors based on in-line cone beam CTs: clinical implementation and first experiences.', 'Digital tomosynthesis (DTS) for verification of target position in early stage lung cancer patients.', 'Stochastic formulation of patient positioning using linac-mounted cone beam imaging with prior knowledge.', 'Quantification of six-degree-of-freedom motion during beam delivery in spine stereotactic body radiotherapy using intra-irradiation cone-beam computed tomography imaging technique.']"""

Methods:   From 2007 to 2009, 154 patients underwent 1.5 Tesla pelvic-phased-array magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the prostate that included T2-WI and DWI before RP. MRI examinations were retrospectively reviewed and grouped by degree of suspicion for tumor: no suspicion for tumor (NST, n = 15), equivocal suspicion for tumor (EST, n = 60), or strong suspicion for tumor (SST, n = 79). The NST/EST groups were combined and compared to the SST group. Preoperative variables were used to assemble a multivariate model. Outcomes reflective of adverse pathology included primary Gleason grade ≥4, pathologic stage ≥T3 (≥pT3), and tumor upgrading. Subgroup analysis was performed for patients meeting eligibility criteria for active surveillance (n = 55). For this analysis, the NST group was compared to the EST/SST groups.  Results:   SST status was associated with adverse preoperative risk factors for aggressive disease. Univariate analysis demonstrated significant association between SST and primary Gleason ≥4 pathology and stage ≥pT3 (P <.05). On multivariate analysis, SST was independently predictive of primary Gleason ≥4 pathology (odds ratio [OR] 6.14, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.97-19.2) and Gleason upgrading (OR 2.47, 95% CI 1.01-6.02). Among patients eligible for active surveillance, those in the NST group had decreased likelihood of Gleason ≥7 disease or stage ≥pT3 compared to the EST/SST groups (7.7% vs 47.6%, P = .01).  Conclusion:   Increased tumor suspicion on T2-WI/DWI MRI is indicative of adverse pathology on RP.

Methods:   Differential progression of global DNA hypomethylation was studied by comparatively dosing zebularine (ZEB) and 5-azacytidine (AZA). Treated and untreated (control) human prostate and liver cancer cells were subjected to confocal scanning microscopy and dedicated 3D image analysis for the following features: differential nuclear MeC/DAPI load and codistribution patterns, cell similarity based on these patterns, and corresponding differences in the topology of low-intensity MeC (LIM) and low in intensity DAPI (LID) sites.  Results:   Both agents generated a high fraction of similar MeC phenotypes across applied concentrations. ZEB exerted similar effects at 10-100-fold higher drug concentrations than its AZA analogue: concentration-dependent progression of global cytosine demethylation, validated by measuring differential MeC levels in repeat sequences using MethyLight, and the concurrent increase in nuclear LIM densities correlated with cellular growth reduction and cytotoxicity.  Conclusions:   3D-qDMI demonstrated the capability of quantitating dose-dependent drug-induced spatial progression of DNA demethylation in cell nuclei, independent from interphase cell-cycle stages and in conjunction with cytotoxicity.

This study was designed to evaluate the effect of in vivo Doxa po-application, in clinically relevant dose, on: (i) steroidogenic machinery homeostasis; (ii) cAMP/cGMP signalling; (iii) transcription profile of ADR in Leydig cells of adult rats. The results showed that po-application of Doxa for once (1×Doxa), or for two (2×Doxa) or 10 (10×Doxa) consecutive days significantly disturbed steroidogenic machinery homeostasis in Leydig cells. Doxa po-application significantly decreased circulating luteinizing hormone and androgens levels. The level of androgens in testicular interstitial fluid and that extracted from testes obtained from 1×Doxa/2×Doxa rats decreased, although it remained unchanged in 10×Doxa rats. Similarly, the ex vivo basal androgen production followed in testes isolated from 1×Doxa/2×Doxa rats decreased, while remained unchanged in 10×Doxa rats. Differently, ex vivo testosterone production and steroidogenic capacity of Leydig cells isolated from 1×Doxa/2×Doxa rats was stimulated, while 10×Doxa had opposite effect. In the same cells, cAMP content/release showed similar stimulatory effect, but back to control level in Leydig cells of 10×Doxa. 1×Doxa/2×Doxa decreased transcripts for cAMP specific phosphodiesterases Pde7b/Pde8b, whereas 10×Doxa increased Pde4d. All types of treatment reduced the expression of genes encoding protein kinase A (PRKA) regulatory subunit (Prkar2b), whereas only 10×Doxa stimulated catalytic subunit (Prkaca). Doxa application more affected cGMP signalling: stimulated transcription of constitutive nitric oxide synthases (Nos1, Nos3) in time-dependent manner, whereas reduced inducible Nos2. 10×Doxa increased guanylyl cyclase 1 transcript and PRKG1 protein in Leydig cells. Orally applied Doxa significantly disturbed the transcriptional 'signature' of steroidogenic machinery, cAMP/cGMP signalling and ADRs and β-ADRs kinases in Leydig cells, thus giving new molecular insights into the role of cAMP/cGMP/adrenalin signalling in Leydig cells homeostasis.""","""['N J Stojkov', 'M M Janjic', 'T S Kostic', 'S A Andric']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Andrology""","""['In vivo blockade of α1-adrenergic receptors mitigates stress-disturbed cAMP and cGMP signaling in Leydig cells.', 'Sustained in vivo blockade of α₁-adrenergic receptors prevented some of stress-triggered effects on steroidogenic machinery in Leydig cells.', 'Sildenafil treatment in vivo stimulates Leydig cell steroidogenesis via the cAMP/cGMP signaling pathway.', 'Endocrine regulation and communicating functions of the Leydig cell.', 'A novel function of geranylgeraniol in regulating testosterone production.', 'Green Synthesized Zinc Oxide Nanoparticles Using Moringa olifera Ethanolic Extract Lessens Acrylamide-Induced Testicular Damage, Apoptosis, and Steroidogenesis-Related Gene Dysregulation in Adult Rats.', 'Unified single-cell analysis of testis gene regulation and pathology in five mouse strains.', 'Reappraising the exteriorization of the mammalian testes through evolutionary physiology.', 'Polytropic Influence of TRIB3 rs2295490 Genetic Polymorphism on Response to Antihypertensive Agents in Patients With Essential Hypertension.', 'Role of C-type natriuretic peptide in the function of normal human sperm.']"""

However, post-operative SB tends to be neglected whereas sexual function (SF) is thoroughly assessed in clinical practice and few studies have focused on and evaluated patients' SB. We retrospectively reviewed 2 345 consecutive patients who underwent RP between 2001 and 2009 at a single institution. SF and SB were assessed using Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) questionnaires. We stratified our cohort by SB recovery and post-operative SF status, including a subset of men who recovered SB despite persistent post-RP sexual dysfunction. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify factors for men who have SB recovery. Of 319 eligible patients, 133 (41.7%) recovered their SB at a mean of 20 months after RP. Among the 133 men who demonstrated SB recovery, 109 had post-operative sexual dysfunction. Patients with SB recovery despite post-RP sexual dysfunction were more likely to be old (p = 0.004), to have higher clinical T stage (p < 0.001), to have more non-nerve-sparing RP (p < 0.001), to have lower pre-operative EPIC-SF/SB scores (p < 0.001), to have more extracapsular extension (p = 0.031) and to be PDE5i non-users after surgery (p < 0.001). In multivariable analysis, predictors for this subset were lower comorbidity (OR 0.62, p = 0.043), higher clinical cancer stage (OR 2.35, p = 0.026), worse pre-operative SF (OR 0.98, p = 0.010), SB (OR 0.98, p < 0.010) and no PDE5i use (OR 0.37, p = 0.002); age was not related (OR 0.99, p = 0.555).

The high temperature requirement factor A3 (HtrA3) is a serine protease homologous to bacterial HtrA. Four human HtrAs have been identified. HtrA1 and HtrA3 share a high degree of domain organization and are downregulated in a number of cancers, suggesting a widespread loss of these proteases in cancer. This study examined how extensively the HtrA (HtrA1-3) proteins are downregulated in commonly used cancer cell lines and primary ovarian tumors.Methods. RT-PCR was applied to various cancer cell lines (n=17) derived from the ovary, endometrium, testes, breast, prostate, and colon, and different subtypes of primary ovarian tumors [granulosa cell tumors (n=19), mucinous cystadenocarcinomas (n=6), serous cystadenocarcinomas (n=8)] and normal ovary (n = 9). HtrA3 protein was localized by immunohistochemistry.Results. HtrA3 was extensively downregulated in the cancer cell lines examined including the granulosa cell tumor-derived cell lines. In primary ovarian tumors, the HtrA3 was significantly lower in serous cystadenocarcinoma and granulosa cell tumors. In contrast, HtrA1 and HtrA2 were expressed in all samples with no significant differences between the control and tumors. In normal postmenopausal ovary, HtrA3 protein was localized to lutenizing stromal cells and corpus albicans. In serous cystadenocarcinoma, HtrA3 protein was absent in the papillae but detected in the mesenchymal cyst wall.Conclusion. HtrA3 is more extensively downregulated than HtrA1-2 in cancer cell lines.

However, hNIS-mediated iodide sequestration requires an intact cell membrane, and the enhancement of infectivity may alter the radioiodide accumulation in vivo. To assess these effects, we constructed Ad-NIS vectors expressing NIS from the major late promoter. Viral tropism was altered using a hybrid Ad5/3 fiber, and rates of viral spread altered through expression of the Ad death protein (ADP). The hybrid 5/3 fiber enhanced Ad-mediated cytolysis and radioisotope uptake in vitro. Replicating ADP-lacking viral vectors showed levels of uptake similar to non-replicating vectors that declined as cells lysed.

However, cancer incidence has been shown to be increased in the context of transplant-associated immunosuppression. The objective of this study is to analyze the incidence, histological spectrum, treatment and survival of various cancer types in HTX patients.  Methods:   We evaluated retrospectively all patients who underwent orthotopic HTX between 2000 and 2011 at our hospital including those patients who underwent HTX in other centers, but did their routine follow-up examinations at our department because of changing residence.  Results:   142 patients had HTX performed at our center in the last 11 years and another 9 patients visited our department for monitoring after HTX performed at an external center (total: 151). Ten patients (6.6%) developed a metachronous malignancy (3 non-melanoma skin cancer, 2 lung cancer and 1 each parotid gland cancer, prostate cancer, renal cancer, urinary bladder cancer and ductal pancreatic cancer). The latency between HTX and the diagnosis of the secondary neoplasm ranged from 33 to 152 months (median 76 months; mean 88 months). In all cases, surgery with or without chemoradiation was the treatment for the metachronous cancer. While most cases followed a favorable course after appropriate surgical and/or oncological treatment, four tumors (1 salivary duct carcinoma, 1 urinary bladder carcinoma, 1 ductal pancreatic cancer and 1 skin cancer) revealed a remarkable aggressiveness with wide-spread metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis or shortly thereafter.  Conclusions:   Incidence of various cancer types among HTX patients in this survey was consistent with previous studies, with lung and skin cancer as the commonest malignancies encountered.

In the United States, the Prostate Cancer Intervention Versus Observation Trial (PIVOT) produced an AMD of 3% (95% CI = -1.1% to 6.5%) after 12 years. It is not known whether a higher frequency of screen detection in PIVOT explains the lower AMD.  Methods:   We assumed the SPCG-4 trial represents RP efficacy and prostate cancer survival in an unscreened population. Given the fraction of screen-detected prostate cancers in PIVOT, we adjusted prostate cancer survival using published estimates of overdiagnosis and lead time to project the effect of screen detection on disease-specific deaths.  Results:   On the basis of published estimates, we assumed that 32% of screen-detected cancers were overdiagnosed and a mean lead time among non-overdiagnosed cancers of 7.7 years. When we adjusted prostate cancer survival for the 76% of case patients in PIVOT who were screen detected, we projected that the AMD after 12 years would be 2.0% (95% CI = -1.6% to 5.6%) based on variation in published estimates of overdiagnosis and mean lead time in the United States.  Conclusions:   If RP efficacy and prostate cancer survival in the absence of screening are similar to that in the SPCG-4 trial, then overdiagnosis and lead time largely explain the lower AMD in PIVOT.

The density of glycan ligands on the protein scaffold was readily varied by changing the molar ratios of the two reactants. Binding studies indicated that the sialylated and desialylated multivalent glycoligands could selectively bind to influenza hemagglutinin and human galectin-3, respectively, with high affinity. In the two glycan-lectin interactions, a clear multivalent effect was observed. Moreover, a cell-based assay showed that the synthetic multivalent glyco-ligands could efficiently inhibit the attachment of galectin-3 to human prostate cancer and lung cancer cell lines.

Materials and methods:   Men in the CaPSURE™ (Cancer of the Prostate Strategic Urologic Research Endeavor) database who underwent radical prostatectomy and had baseline and 2-year posttreatment UCLA-PCI sexual function and urinary function scores were selected. Nerve sparing was categorized as bilateral, unilateral or none and the level of pretreatment sexual function was divided into quartiles. The cohort was divided into subgroups of nerve sparing technique and pretreatment sexual function. Differences between sexual function and urinary function among subgroups were determined. A test of interaction was performed between preoperative sexual function and degree of nerve sparing on postoperative sexual function and urinary function scores.  Results:   A total of 1,322 patients met the study inclusion criteria. Median patient age was 61 years (range 41 to 79). Bilateral, unilateral and no nerve sparing procedures were performed in 899, 200 and 223 men, respectively. The effects of nerve sparing on sexual function differed among the quartiles of preoperative sexual function (p <0.01). Nerve sparing did not have an effect on the sexual function of men in the lowest quartile of preoperative sexual function score (p = 0.15) but did have a significant beneficial effect on sexual function in the higher 3 quartiles (p = 0.04, p <0.01 and p <0.01, respectively). Alternatively, nerve sparing improved urinary function in men in the lowest quartile of baseline sexual function.  Conclusions:   Nerve sparing radical prostatectomy results in better sexual function outcomes than no nerve sparing in most men except those with little baseline function. Urinary function was positively impacted in all men. Men who are suitable candidates for nerve preservation may benefit from nerve sparing surgery.

To determine the reliability of PSA-BF in predicting clinical outcomes, the Kamat definition, which does not consider PSA-BF during the first 24 months after EBRT, was tested against three other more frequently used methods (American Society of Radiation Oncology, Vancouver, and American Society of Radiation Oncology-Phoenix), which do. Secondly, their relative accuracies in predicting the clinical outcomes were also calculated.  Materials and methods:   In January 2011, 193 consecutive CaPs, treated with radical EBRT + HT in our institution from 1999 to 2002, were retrospectively investigated. BF was calculated according to the Kamat definition against the other three above-mentioned methods. Each BF-free survival was analyzed in function of every clinical endpoint (clinical-failure-free survival, cause specific survival, and overall survival) using univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses. The accuracy of each definition in predicting clinical relapse was also calculated and compared.  Results:   Only the Kamat BF definition had both a significant Cox hazard ratio, regarding clinical events or cancer deaths, and the best accuracy values in predicting clinical outcomes. Retrospective study design was the major limitation of the study.  Conclusions:   Only the Kamat definition, which does not consider PSA-BF during the first 24 months after EBRT + HT, was shown to be a reliable predictor of clinical events. Thus, our results suggest that solely PSA-based BF should not be considered as a reliable surrogate endpoint during the first 24 months after EBRT + HT.

Materials and methods:   The functional studies were performed in LNCaP and PC3 cell lines. Data on the mRNA expression of sets of genes in human clinical samples, including prostate tissues from organ donors, prostate primary cancer, and metastatic cancer, were extracted from the National Center for Biotechnology Informations Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Statistical tests were applied.  Results:   We showed that elevated levels of cAMP/PKA pathways induced an increased expression of AR and PSA proteins in LNCaP cells in the absence of androgen. A cAMP-associated phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4) inhibitor, rolipram induced an up-regulation in AR expression, whereas a cAMP enhancer, forskolin increased PSA level without affecting AR expression. Forskolin treatment increased the level of PKA R1α in LNCaP cells, but remarkably inhibited R1α expression in aggressive PC3 cells. In patients with CaP, we found that the expression of genes encoding R1α and phosphodiesterase-4B was statistically significantly lower in the metastatic specimens than that in the primary CaP specimens or in the normal prostate tissues (P<0.01) and was reversely correlated with AR expression. Conversely, AR and PRKAR2B mRNA expressions were significantly higher in metastatic lesions than those in the primary CaP specimens or in the normal prostate tissues (P<0.01).

Once used to treat benign prostate hypertrophy, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) suspended the use of lonidamine due to the occurrence of liver problems arising from its poor pharmaceutical properties. The objectives of the present study were to develop targeting lonidamine liposomes in combination with targeting epirubicin liposomes to circumvent drug-resistant cancer. Evaluations were performed on A549 and drug-resistant A549cDDP lung cancer cells and drug-resistant A549cDDP xenografted BALB/c nude mice. A DQA-PEG(2000)-DSPE conjugate was incorporated onto the liposomes as a targeting molecule. The constructed targeting lonidamine liposomes and targeting epirubicin liposomes measured were approximately 80 nm. The targeting lonidamine liposomes significantly enhanced the inhibitory effect of the targeting epirubicin liposomes in the drug-resistant A549cDDP cells in a lonidamine dose-dependent manner. Mechanism studies revealed that the targeting liposomes were selectively accumulated in the mitochondria, dissipating the mitochondrial membrane potential, opening the mitochondrial permeability transition pores, and releasing cytochrome C by translocation. This initiated a cascade of caspase 9 and 3 reactions and activated the pro-apoptotic Bax protein while suppressing the anti-apoptotic Mcl-1 protein, thereby enhancing the cytotoxic effect by acting on the mitochondrial signaling pathways. The efficacy in treating the drug-resistant A549cDDP xenografted tumor model after administration of the targeting lonidamine liposomes plus targeting epirubicin liposomes was the most significant compared with the administration of the controls at comparable doses. In conclusion, targeting lonidamine liposomes could be used as a potent co-therapy with an anticancer agent to enhance the efficacy of treating drug-resistant cancer by acting on the mitochondrial signaling pathways.""","""['Nan Li', 'Cheng-Xiang Zhang', 'Xiao-Xing Wang', 'Liang Zhang', 'Xu Ma', 'Jia Zhou', 'Rui-Jun Ju', 'Xiu-Ying Li', 'Wei-Yu Zhao', 'Wan-Liang Lu']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Biomaterials""","""['The anticancer efficacy of paclitaxel liposomes modified with mitochondrial targeting conjugate in resistant lung cancer.', 'The use of mitochondrial targeting resveratrol liposomes modified with a dequalinium polyethylene glycol-distearoylphosphatidyl ethanolamine conjugate to induce apoptosis in resistant lung cancer cells.', 'Mitochondrial targeting liposomes incorporating daunorubicin and quinacrine for treatment of relapsed breast cancer arising from cancer stem cells.', 'Re-programming tumour cell metabolism to treat cancer: no lone target for lonidamine.', 'Mitocans: mitochondrial targeted anti-cancer drugs as improved therapies and related patent documents.', 'Nanomedicine-based adjuvant therapy: a promising solution for lung cancer.', 'Mitochondria-targeted nanoparticles (mitoNANO): An emerging therapeutic shortcut for cancer.', 'Recent advances in mitochondrial diseases: From molecular insights to therapeutic perspectives.', 'Multidrug Resistance in Cancer: Understanding Molecular Mechanisms, Immunoprevention and Therapeutic Approaches.', 'Dual-functional melanin-based nanoliposomes for combined chemotherapy and photothermal therapy of pancreatic cancer.']"""

The aim of the study was to demonstrate the changes in the steroid hormone profile (comprising corticosteroids, androgens and progesterone) in the urine of patients with the urogenital tract cancer versus urine from healthy subjects. A reliable analytical method based on liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry was successfully applied to determine the urinary profiles of 6 endogenous steroids: cortisol, cortisone, corticosterone, testosterone, epitestosterone and progesterone for 92 urogenital tract cancer patients and 100 healthy controls. The obtained data was further evaluated by in-depth chemometric analysis, including the applied standardized Kennard-Stone's algorithm to pre-process the data. Mann-Whitney U test revealed statistically significant (p <0.05) differences in concentration of androgens and progesterone in the case of bladder cancer for male and female population, for male also cortisol and cortisone levels were significantly increased. PCA analysis proved a reasonable trend for differentiating healthy and cancer patients, and finally, applying PLS-DA model we were able to correctly classify 80.56%of cancer patients.

They are thought to have functions as transcriptional enhancers and regulators of alternative splicing. Recently, it was shown that numerous RNAs are transcribed from these regions. These UCR-encoded transcripts (ucRNAs) were found to be expressed in a tissue- and disease-specific manner and may interfere with the function of other RNAs through RNA: RNA interactions. We hypothesized that ucRNAs have unidentified roles in the pathogenesis of human prostate cancer. In a pilot study, we examined ucRNA expression profiles in human prostate tumors.  Methods:   Using a custom microarray with 962 probesets representing sense and antisense sequences for the 481 human UCRs, we examined ucRNA expression in resected, fresh-frozen human prostate tissues (57 tumors, 7 non-cancerous prostate tissues) and in cultured prostate cancer cells treated with either epigenetic drugs (the hypomethylating agent, 5-Aza 2'deoxycytidine, and the histone deacetylase inhibitor, trichostatin A) or a synthetic androgen, R1881. Expression of selected ucRNAs was also assessed by qRT-PCR and NanoString®-based assays. Because ucRNAs may function as RNAs that target protein-coding genes through direct and inhibitory RNA: RNA interactions, computational analyses were applied to identify candidate ucRNA:mRNA binding pairs.  Results:   We observed altered ucRNA expression in prostate cancer (e.g., uc.106+, uc.477+, uc.363 + A, uc.454 + A) and found that these ucRNAs were associated with cancer development, Gleason score, and extraprostatic extension after controlling for false discovery (false discovery rate < 5% for many of the transcripts). We also identified several ucRNAs that were responsive to treatment with either epigenetic drugs or androgen (R1881). For example, experiments with LNCaP human prostate cancer cells showed that uc.287+ is induced by R1881 (P < 0.05) whereas uc.283 + A was up-regulated following treatment with combined 5-Aza 2'deoxycytidine and trichostatin A (P < 0.05). Additional computational analyses predicted RNA loop-loop interactions of 302 different sense and antisense ucRNAs with 1058 different mRNAs, inferring possible functions of ucRNAs via direct interactions with mRNAs.

The aim of this study was to investigate organ motion-induced dose degradations for the prostate, seminal vesicle and the pelvic lymph node when treating these targets with proton therapy, using different image-guidance and delivery strategies.  Material and methods:   Four patients were selected from a larger series as they displayed large inter-fractional variation in bladder and rectum volume. Intensity-modulated proton therapy plans were generated using both simultaneous integrated and sequential boost delivery. For each technique, three isotropic margin expansions (in the range of 4-10 mm) were evaluated for the clinical target volume of prostate (CTV-p), seminal vesicles (CTV-sv) and lymph nodes (CTV-ln). Simulation of the dose degradations for all treatment plans were based on dose re-calculations for the 8-9 repeat CTs available for each patient, after applying rigid registrations to reproduce set-up based on either intra-prostatic fiducials or bony anatomy.  Results:   The simulated dose received by 99% of the target volume (D(99)) and generalized equivalent dose (gEUD) showed substantial inter-patient variations. For 40% of the investigated scenarios, the patient average simulated D(99) for all targets were within 2 GyE from the planned dose. The largest difference between simulated and planned dose was seen for the CTV-sv when using SIB delivery, with an average relative reduction in D(99) of 13% and 15% for the largest margin expansion, when positioned using fiducials and bony anatomy, respectively.  Conclusions:   The most severe dose degradations were found for CTV-sv, but they were also evident for CTV-ln.

Increased BIRC6 expression was associated with Gleason 6-8 cancers and castration resistance. Reduction of BIRC6 expression in LNCaP cells led to a marked reduction in cell proliferation which was associated with an increase in apoptosis and a decrease in autophagosome formation.

OBJECTIVE, DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We evaluated the association between self-reported diabetes and cancer incidence in the NIH-AARP (National Institutes of Health-American Association of Retired Persons) Diet and Health Study, a prospective cohort in which 295,276 men and 199,591 women completed a questionnaire in 1995-1996 and were followed up for cancer through 2006.  Main outcome measures:   Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for cancer incidence, overall and by type, were estimated from multivariate Cox proportional hazards models.  Results:   Diabetes was positively associated with total incident cancer in women (1.07, 95% CI 1.02-1.12) but inversely in men (0.96, 95% CI 0.93-0.98). However, diabetes was inversely associated with prostate cancer (HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.70-0.78), which constituted 42% of cancers in men. After excluding prostate cancer, diabetes was also positively associated with cancer in men (HR 1.09, 95% CI 1.04-1.14). By site, diabetes was positively associated with anal, bladder, colon, kidney, liver, pancreatic, rectal, and stomach cancers and in women with endometrial cancer. We also evaluated the joint effect of obesity and diabetes and observed that diabetes conferred additional risk, beyond that of overweight or obesity, for cancer overall, excluding prostate, and for certain sites including the bladder, colon, endometrium, kidney, liver, pancreas, rectum, and stomach.  Conclusion:   Our results suggest an etiological role for diabetes in a number of cancers, independent of obesity, and that preventing diabetes may contribute to reduced cancer risk.""","""['Gabriel Y Lai', 'Yikyung Park', 'Patricia Hartge', 'Albert R Hollenbeck', 'Neal D Freedman']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Clin Endocrinol Metab""","""['Attained height, sex, and risk of cancer at different anatomic sites in the NIH-AARP diet and health study.', 'Multivitamin Use and Overall and Site-Specific Cancer Risks in the National Institutes of Health-AARP Diet and Health Study.', 'Dairy food, calcium, and risk of cancer in the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study.', 'Association of Physical Activity by Type and Intensity With Digestive System Cancer Risk.', 'Is early-onset cancer an emerging global epidemic?

Combination of IC(50) dose of doxorubicin and lithium chloride led to S phase arrest (p<0.001, compared to control, lithium chloride or doxorubicin alone). Moreover, G2/M arrest was significantly increased when low dose of doxorubicin and vinblastine were combined with lithium chloride (p<0.001, compared to control and lithium chloride alone). DU145 cells were highly sensitive to vinblastine and no significant changes were observed when combined with lithium chloride. The IC(50) doses of all three drugs combined with lithium chloride demonstrated decreased cell percent in G1 phase compared to control or lithium chloride alone (p<0.001).

JARID1B is overexpressed in several cancers, including breast cancer, prostate cancer, and lung cancer. In addition, JARID1B is required for mammary tumor formation in syngeneic or xenograft mouse models. JARID1B-expressing melanoma cells are associated with increased self-renewal character. Therefore, JARID1B represents an attractive target for cancer therapy. Here we characterized JARID1B using a homogeneous luminescence-based demethylase assay. We then conducted a high throughput screen of over 15,000 small molecules to identify inhibitors of JARID1B. From this screen, we identified several known JmjC histone demethylase inhibitors, including 2,4-pyridinedicarboxylic acid and catechols. More importantly, we identified several novel inhibitors, including 2-4(4-methylphenyl)-1,2-benzisothiazol-3(2H)-one (PBIT), which inhibits JARID1B with an IC50 of about 3 μm in vitro. Consistent with this, PBIT treatment inhibited removal of H3K4me3 by JARID1B in cells. Furthermore, this compound inhibited proliferation of cells expressing higher levels of JARID1B.

Results:   The results demonstrate that for patients with bone metastatic castration-resistant PCa, decision for or against treatment with either denosumab or zoledronic acid must not only consider efficacy but needs to balance the desired effects versus potential side effects. This is of specific relevance since life expectancy is limited in this patient cohort with end-stage disease.

The standard distribution of 17-18 catheters designed for WG was used to generate HG plans. The same OARs namely bladder, rectum, and urethra contours and dose constraints were applied for HG and WG plans. The HG contour was a modification of the WG contour whereby the urethra divided the prostate into HGs. The prescription dose was 7.25 Gy×6. Evaluated dose parameters were target dose D90, V100, and V150 and D0.1 cc, D1 cc, and D2 cc to OARs.  Results:   The HG plans had a D90, V100, and V150 to the HG target of 112%, 97.6%, and 33.8%, respectively. The WG plans had a D90, V100, and V150 to the WG target of 108%, 98.8%, and 26.5%, respectively.

According to the World Report Cancer in 2000, cancer tends to be a major problem of public health in the developing nations. This study research aimed at describing the epidemiological features of cancers in Cote d'Ivoire. It is a 26-year retrospective and descriptive study focusing on all cancers confirmed histologically by using the data from the registers of Anatomic Pathology laboratory of Abidjan teaching hospitals. The parameters of the study were frequency, age, sex, site and histological type. We obtained 12,841 cancers within patients aged from 2 months to 107 years old along with 51.26-year median age and 0.9 as sex-ratio. The most important cancer locations are cervix (17.41%) followed by skin (15.81%), prostate (7.73%), breast (6.88%), and stomach (6.09%). With women, the median age was 49.23 years, and the most common cancers were cervical cancer (33.25%) followed by breast cancer (12.44%) and skin cancer (10.50%). With men, the median age was 53.95 years, and the most frequent cancers were skin cancer (21.29%) followed by prostate cancer (15.69%) and stomach cancer (8.71%). Burkitt lymphoma (33.95%), retinoblastoma (10.92%) and nephroblastoma (5.88%) are the most important cancers in children. Cancers are frequent in Cote d'Ivoire. Cervical cancer, skin cancer, and prostate are updated problems with a worse prognosis.

The in vitro growth pattern and tumorigenicity of SP stem cells were verified by soft agar colony-formation trial.

Expression of TMEFF2 is deregulated in prostate cancer, suggesting a role in this disease, but the molecular mechanism(s) involved in this effect are not clear. Although androgens promote tmeff2 transcription, androgen delivery to castrated animals carrying CWR22 xenografts increases TMEFF2 protein levels in the absence of mRNA changes, suggesting that TMEFF2 may also be post-transcriptionally regulated. Here we show that translation of TMEFF2 is regulated by androgens. Addition of physiological concentrations of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) to prostate cancer cell lines increases translation of endogenous TMEFF2 or transfected TMEFF2-Luciferase fusions, and this effect requires the presence of upstream open reading frames (uORFs) in the 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR) of TMEFF2. Using chemical and siRNA inhibition of the androgen receptor (AR), we show that the androgen effect on TMEFF2 translation is mediated by the AR. Importantly, DHT also promotes phosphorylation of the α subunit of the translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2α) in an AR-dependent manner, paralleling the effect on TMEFF2 translation. Moreover, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress conditions, which promote eIF2α phosphorylation, also stimulate TMEFF2 translation. These results indicate that androgen signaling promotes eIF2α phosphorylation and subsequent translation of TMEFF2 via a mechanism that requires uORFs in the 5'-UTR of TMEFF2.""","""['Ryan F Overcash', 'Vesna A Chappell', 'Thomas Green', 'Christopher B Geyer', 'Adam S Asch', 'Maria J Ruiz-Echevarría']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['TMEFF2 is an androgen-regulated gene exhibiting antiproliferative effects in prostate cancer cells.', 'Phorbol ester-induced shedding of the prostate cancer marker transmembrane protein with epidermal growth factor and two follistatin motifs 2 is mediated by the disintegrin and metalloproteinase-17.', 'Identification of novel androgen receptor target genes in prostate cancer.', 'Multifaceted interaction between the androgen and Wnt signaling pathways and the implication for prostate cancer.', 'Androgen action in the prostate gland.', 'The dark side of mRNA translation and the translation machinery in glioblastoma.', 'The endoplasmic reticulum stress response in prostate cancer.', 'The Androgen Hormone-Induced Increase in Androgen Receptor Protein Expression Is Caused by the Autoinduction of the Androgen Receptor Translational Activity.', 'Whole-Genome Sequencing of 100 Genomes Identifies a Distinctive Genetic Susceptibility Profile of Qatari Patients with Hypertension.', 'Analysis of novel enzalutamide-resistant cells: upregulation of testis-specific Y-encoded protein gene promotes the expression of androgen receptor splicing variant 7.']"""

Dasatinib has been shown to have preclinical activity against human prostate, breast, pancreatic, lung, and head and neck cancer. To determine whether Dasatinib can inhibit the growth of laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma, in the present study, we investigated the antitumor effect of Dasatinib on Hep-2 cells. Hep-2 cells were treated with different concentrations of Dasatinib for different time. Cell proliferation, cell cycle distribution, and cell apoptosis were evaluated using MTT assay, flow cytometry, and fluorescent microscopy. It was found that Dasatinib exhibited significant efficacy in growth inhibition, cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase, and apoptosis induction in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Measuring the modulation of regulators in the cell cycle, apoptosis and signal transductions by western blot analysis showed that the effect of Dasatinib was due to suppression of the expression of Bax, Bcl-2, Caspase-3, and Caspase-8. Moreover, in vivo studies were performed in a nude mouse xenograft model, the new prescription (DDP + Dasatinib) was better than DDP alone in terms of therapeutic efficacy. In conclusion, the antitumor effect of Dasatinib on Hep-2 cells was due to the induction of cell cycle arrest as well as apoptosis. The possible mechanisms underlying the action might be attributed to the suppression of Src phosphorylation.

Materials and methods:   The ESUR has recently published a structured reporting system for mMRI of the prostate (PI-RADS). This system involves the use of 5-point Likert scales for grading the findings obtained with different MRI techniques. The mMRI includes T2-weighted MRI, diffusion-weighted imaging, dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI, and MR spectroscopy. In a first step, the fundamentals of technical implementation were determined by consensus, taking into account in particular the German-speaking community. Then, representative images were selected by consensus on the basis of examinations of the three institutions. In addition, scoring intervals for an aggregated PI-RADS score were determined in consensus.  Results:   The multiparametric methods were discussed critically with regard to implementation and the current status. Criteria used for grading mMRI findings with the PI-RADS classification were concretized by succinct examples. Using the consensus table for aggregated scoring in a clinical setting, a diagnosis of suspected prostate cancer should be made if the PI-RADS score is 4 or higher (≥ 10 points if 3 techniques are used or ≥ 13 points if 4 techniques are used). Finally, a graphic scheme was developed for communicating mMRI prostate findings.  Conclusion:   Structured reporting according to the ESUR guidelines contributes to quality assurance by standardizing prostate mMRI, and it facilities the communication of findings to urologists.""","""['M Röthke', 'D Blondin', 'H-P Schlemmer', 'T Franiel']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Rofo""","""['Prostate imaging reporting and data system (PI-RADS): reflections on early experience with a standardized interpretation scheme for multiparametric prostate MRI.', 'Inter-reader agreement of multi-parametric MR imaging for the detection of prostate cancer: evaluation of a scoring system.', 'Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging in the detection of prostate cancer.', 'Evaluation of the prostate imaging reporting and data system for the detection of prostate cancer by the results of targeted biopsy of the prostate.', 'Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging of the prostate - technique and clinical applications.', 'Intravesical protrusion of giant median prostatic lobe: A case report.', 'Structured reporting in radiologic education - Potential of different PI-RADS versions in prostate MRI controlled by in-bore MR-guided biopsies.', ""Structured reporting in radiology : German and European radiology societies' point of view."", 'Current developments on digitalization : Analysis of quality and economics in healthcare.', 'Tissue clearing techniques for three-dimensional optical imaging of intact human prostate and correlations with multi-parametric MRI.']"""

Patients and methods:   We retrospectively reviewed cases treated and/or followed up at our institutions in the period 2000-2011.  Results:   Fifteen patients were identified (eight men and seven women; mean age, 55 years). Presenting symptoms were rectal/perirectal (eight), rectovaginal space (four), or retrovesical/prostatic (three) mass. Primary surgical treatment was local excision (six), deep anterior resection (eight), and palliative diagnostic excision (one). Tumor mean size was 4.8 cm. All but two cases were high risk (Miettinen and Lasota, Semin Diagn Pathol 23:70-83, 2006). R0 resection was achieved in 46% of cases: one of six local excisions vs. five of seven deep anterior resection (16 vs. 71%, respectively). All three cases who received total mesorectal excision had R0. Non-R0 status was mainly due to opening of tumor capsule at surgery (Rx). Seven of 14 patients (50%) developed ≥1 pelvic local recurrences at a mean period of 48.4 months (mean follow-up, 61.6 months). Only two patients developed distant metastasis (adrenal, liver, and peritoneal). Recurrences developed after Rx (three), R1 (two), and unknown R-status (two). Successful mutational analysis in 13 patients revealed KIT mutations in all (10 exon 11, 2 exon 9, and 1 exon 13).  Conclusion:   Our results confirm the high local recurrence rate of anorectal GISTs (50%) which correlates with the common practice of suboptimal oncological primary tumor resection (Rx or R1 = 7/13).

The tumor suppressor p53 plays an important role in regulating the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cancer cell stemness, which have been proposed to play critical roles in cancer metastasis. MiR-145, a direct target of p53, represses bone metastasis of PCa and is involved in regulating EMT and cancer cell stemness. However, it is unknown whether wild‑type p53 (WT-p53) plays a role in regulating invasion, EMT and cancer cell stemness of PCa cells and whether miR-145 mediates the function of WT-p53. In the present study, we found that ectopic expression of WT-p53 inhibited the migration and invasion, and enhanced the adhesion of p53-null PC-3 cells derived from PCa bone metastasis. Furthermore, WT-p53 suppressed the expression of the mesenchymal markers fibronectin, vimentin, N-cadherin, ZEB2 and upregulated the expression of the epithelial marker E-cadherin in PC-3 cells. Moreover, WT-p53 also suppressed colony formation, tumor sphere formation and expression of CSC markers and stemness factors including CD44, Oct4, c-Myc and Klf4 in PC-3 cells. Importantly, WT-p53 upregulated the expression of miR-145, and the inhibitory effects of WT-p53 on migration, invasion, EMT and stemness of PC-3 cells were reversed by anti-miR-145. Together, our findings demonstrate that WT-p53 suppresses migration, invasion, EMT and stemness in PC-3 cells at least partially through modulating miR-145. These results suggest that loss of WT-p53 may promote the bone metastasis of PCa at least partially through repressing miR-145 to elevate EMT and stemness of cancer cells.""","""['Dong Ren', 'Min Wang', 'Wei Guo', 'Xiaohui Zhao', ""Xiang'an Tu"", 'Shuai Huang', 'Xuenong Zou', 'Xinsheng Peng']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Int J Oncol""","""['Double-negative feedback loop between ZEB2 and miR-145 regulates epithelial-mesenchymal transition and stem cell properties in prostate cancer cells.', 'HEF1 promotes epithelial mesenchymal transition and bone invasion in prostate cancer under the regulation of microRNA-145.', 'miR-143 and miR-145 inhibit stem cell characteristics of PC-3 prostate cancer cells.', 'MicroRNAs involved in regulating epithelial-mesenchymal transition and cancer stem cells as molecular targets for cancer therapeutics.', 'MicroRNAs and epithelial-mesenchymal transition in prostate cancer.', 'p53 isoform expression promotes a stemness phenotype and inhibits doxorubicin sensitivity in breast cancer.', 'Recent Advances in Transcription Factors Biomarkers and Targeted Therapies Focusing on Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition.', 'Long non-coding RNA MFSD4A-AS1 promotes lymphangiogenesis and lymphatic metastasis of papillary thyroid cancer.', 'The p53 Family Members p63 and p73 Roles in the Metastatic Dissemination: Interactions with microRNAs and TGFβ Pathway.', 'Molecular Targeting of the Most Functionally Complex Gene in Precision Oncology: p53.']"""

Recent evidence suggests that the regulation of Duox2 expression is under the control of pro-inflammatory cytokines and that Duox2-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) contribute to the inflammation-related tissue injury that occurs in two pre-malignant, inflammatory conditions: chronic pancreatitis and inflammatory bowel disease. Because no reliable Duox antibodies are commercially available, we report the development of a murine monoclonal antibody (MAb) to Duox2 (clone Duox S-12) and its use for the characterization of Duox2 expression in human tumors, tumor cell lines and normal tissues. Duox S-12 specifically detected both endogenously- and ectopically-expressed Duox2 protein by immunoblotting, immunofluorescence microscopy and immunohistochemistry (where both membranous and cytoplasmic staining were present). Duox2 expression detected by Duox S-12 was functionally coupled to the generation of H(2)O(2) in pancreatic cancer cells that expressed Duox2 and its cognate maturation factor DuoxA2. Although Duox S-12 recognizes ectopically expressed Duox1 protein because of the extensive amino acid homology between Duox1 and Duox2, the lack of substantial Duox1 mRNA expression in human tumors (except thyroid cancer) allowed us to evaluate Duox2 expression across a wide range of normal and malignant tissues by immuno-histochemistry. Duox2 was expressed at elevated levels in many human cancers, most notably tumors of the prostate, lung, colon and breast while brain tumors and lymphomas demonstrated the lowest frequency of expression.

In this study, we have identified a key molecule, the Vav3 oncogene, and investigated the effects of Vav3 overexpression on cancer cell growth and malignant behavior and the possible apoptosis-inducing effect of Vav3 expression knockdown by small interfering ribonucleic acid (siRNA) in LNCaP cells under chronic hypoxia (LNCaP/CH).  Methods and materials:   Hypoxia-inducible oncogenes were identified by complementary deoxyribonucleic acid (cDNA) microarray and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis in order to investigate gene ontology and functional pathways and networks. siRNA was used to knockdown the Vav3 target gene and analyze the effects on proliferation, invasion, migration, and apoptosis of LNCaP/CH cells. Vav3 cDNA was transfected into LNCaP cells under normoxia (LNCaP/N) to establish Vav3-overexpressing clonal cell lines, whose proliferation, invasion, and migration was then examined. Immunoblot analysis was used to investigate the activation of Akt, a Vav3 downstream target molecule.  Results:   cDNA microarray analysis and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis identified Vav3 as a hypoxia-inducible oncogene that was highly associated with malignant behavior. Vav3 messenger RNA and protein expression in LNCaP/CH cells were higher than in LNCaP/N and LNCaP cells cultured under acute hypoxia (LNCaP/AH). The growth rate of LNCaP/CH cells was lower than that of LNCaP/N cells but higher than that of LNCaP/AH cells. LNCaP/CH cells showed higher invasion and migration than LNCaP/N and LNCaP/AH cells. Interrupting Vav3 expression strongly suppressed the proliferation, invasion, and migration of LNCaP/CH cells. Furthermore, siRNA led to apoptosis with increased caspase-3 and cleaved poly (adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase activation in LNCaP/CH cells. Stable Vav3 overexpression in LNCaP cells promoted cell proliferation, invasion, and migration with Akt activation.

We explored the effect of Leapfrog volume thresholds (LVT) on 5 short-term radical cystectomy (RC) outcomes.  Materials and methods:   Within the Health Care Utilization Project Nationwide Inpatient Sample, we focused on RCs performed between 2001 and 2007. We tested the rates of in-hospital mortality, intraoperative and postoperative complications, blood transfusions, as well as length of stay, stratified according to the number of LVT met.

Identification of cellular factors affecting AR transcriptional activity could in principle yield new targets that reduce AR activity and combat prostate cancer, yet a comprehensive analysis of the genes required for AR-dependent transcriptional activity has not been determined. Using an unbiased genetic approach that takes advantage of the evolutionary conservation of AR signaling, we have conducted a genome-wide RNAi screen in Drosophila cells for genes required for AR transcriptional activity and applied the results to human prostate cancer cells. We identified 45 AR-regulators, which include known pathway components and genes with functions not previously linked to AR regulation, such as HIPK2 (a protein kinase) and MED19 (a subunit of the Mediator complex). Depletion of HIPK2 and MED19 in human prostate cancer cells decreased AR target gene expression and, importantly, reduced the proliferation of androgen-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer cells. We also systematically analyzed additional Mediator subunits and uncovered a small subset of Mediator subunits that interpret AR signaling and affect AR-dependent transcription and prostate cancer cell proliferation. Importantly, targeting of HIPK2 by an FDA-approved kinase inhibitor phenocopied the effect of depletion by RNAi and reduced the growth of AR-positive, but not AR-negative, treatment-resistant prostate cancer cells.

However, there are discrepancies between these reports of how androgens affect TRAIL-induced cell death. To clarify the role of androgens on TRAIL-induced apoptosis in prostate cancer cells, we investigated the effects of androgen on TRAIL-induced cell death in a dose-response manner. Our results showed that although androgens sensitize LNCaP cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis, this effect is dose-dependent and biphasic. We found that low levels of androgen are superior to high levels of androgen in term of sensitizing LNCaP cells to TRAIL. We also found that upregulation of DR5 (TRAIL-R2) expression by androgens is critical for sensitizing LNCaP cells to TRAIL. However, low levels of androgen are sufficient to induce DR5 expression and sensitize LNCaP cells to TRAIL-induced cell death.

A deprivation gap in survival (better survival for the least deprived compared with the most deprived) has been reported but it is not known if differential distribution of earlier age or lower grade disease at diagnosis might explain such patterns. We therefore investigated the impact of age and Gleason grade at diagnosis on the deprivation gap in survival of prostate cancer patients over time. Incident cases of prostate cancer (ICD-10 C61) from the West of Scotland were extracted from the Scottish Cancer Registry from 1991 to 2007. Socio-economic circumstances were measured using the Scottish Index for Multiple Deprivation 2004 (SIMD). Age and deprivation specific mortality rates were obtained from the General Registrar Office for Scotland (GRO(S)). The survival gradient across the five deprivation categories was estimated with linear regression, weighted by the variance of the relative survival estimate. We examined the data for 15,292 adults diagnosed with prostate cancer between 1991 and 2007. Despite substantial improvements in survival of prostate cancer patients, a deprivation gap persists throughout the three periods of diagnoses. The deprivation gap in five year relative survival widened from -4.76 in 1991-1996 to -10.08 in 2003-2007. On age and grade-specific analyses, a significant deprivation gap in five year survival existed between all age groups except among patients' age ≥75 and both low and high grade disease. On multivariate analyses, deprivation was significantly associated with increased excess risk of death (RER 1.48, 95% CI 1.31-1.68, p-value<0.001) independent of age, Gleason grade and period of diagnosis. The deprivation gap in survival from prostate cancer cannot be wholly explained by socio-economic differentials in early detection of disease.

Methods:   129 male participants, ranging in age from 50 to 71 years (mean 55 years), rode in a recreational group bicycle ride of between 55 and 160 kilometers. Blood samples for tPSA analysis were drawn within 60 minutes before starting, and within 5 minutes after completing the ride. The pre-cycling and post-cycling tPSA values were log transformed for normality and compared using paired t-tests. Linear regression was used to assess the relationship between changes in tPSA with age and distance cycled.  Results:   Bicycle riding caused tPSA to increase by an average of 9.5% (95% CI = 6.1-12.9; p<0.001) or 0.23 ng/ml. The number of participants with an elevated tPSA (using the standard PSA normal range cut-off of 4.0 ng/ml) increased from two pre-cycle to six post-cycle (or from five to eight when using age-based normal ranges). Univariate linear regression analysis revealed that the change in tPSA was positively correlated with age and the distance cycled.  Conclusions:   Cycling causes an average 9.5% increase in tPSA, in healthy male cyclists ≥50 years old, when measured within 5 minutes post cycling.

Methodology:   In order to provide new therapeutic approaches targeting CLU, we developed a strategy based on exon skipping by using a lentiviral construct to preferentially induce the nuclear spliced form of the protein. The molecular construct was transduced in LNCaP cells for testing the modulation of sensitivity of the transduced cells to pro-apoptotic stress.  Results and conclusions:   We showed an increase of nCLU/sCLU expression ratio in the prostate cancer cell line ""LNCaP"" after lentiviral vector-U7 nCLU transduction. Moreover, we showed a significant inhibition of cell proliferation in nCLU-U7 LNCaP cells after treatment with cisplatin and after exposure to ionizing radiation compared to control cells. Finally, we showed that nCLU-U7 LNCaP cells exposure to UV-C significantly reduced an increase of cell death compared to control. Finally, we showed that modulating nCLU expression had profound impact on Ku70/Bax interaction as well as Rad17 expression which could be a key mechanism in sensitizing cells to cell death.

Tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells (TIM), including CD11b (ITGAM)(+)F4/80 (EMR1)+ tumor-associated macrophages (TAM), and CD11b(+)Gr-1 (LY6G)+ myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC), respond to cancer-related stresses and play critical roles in promoting tumor angiogenesis, tissue remodeling, and immunosuppression. In this report, we used a prostate cancer model to investigate the effects of irradiation on TAMs and MDSCs in tumor-bearing animals. Unexpectedly, when primary tumor sites were irradiated, we observed a systemic increase of MDSCs in spleen, lung, lymph nodes, and peripheral blood. Cytokine analysis showed that the macrophage colony-stimulating factor CSF1 increased by two-fold in irradiated tumors. Enhanced macrophage migration induced by conditioned media from irradiated tumor cells was completely blocked by a selective inhibitor of CSF1R. These findings were confirmed in patients with prostate cancer, where serum levels of CSF1 increased after radiotherapy. Mechanistic investigations revealed the recruitment of the DNA damage-induced kinase ABL1 into cell nuclei where it bound the CSF1 gene promoter and enhanced CSF1 gene transcription. When added to radiotherapy, a selective inhibitor of CSF1R suppressed tumor growth more effectively than irradiation alone. Our results highlight the importance of CSF1/CSF1R signaling in the recruitment of TIMs that can limit the efficacy of radiotherapy. Furthermore, they suggest that CSF1 inhibitors should be evaluated in clinical trials in combination with radiotherapy as a strategy to improve outcomes.""","""['Jingying Xu', 'Jemima Escamilla', 'Stephen Mok', 'John David', 'Saul Priceman', 'Brian West', 'Gideon Bollag', 'William McBride', 'Lily Wu']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Cancer Res""","""['Re: CSF1R signaling blockade stanches tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells and improves the efficacy of radiotherapy in prostate cancer.', 'Targeting distinct tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells by inhibiting CSF-1 receptor: combating tumor evasion of antiangiogenic therapy.', 'Re: CSF1R signaling blockade stanches tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells and improves the efficacy of radiotherapy in prostate cancer.', 'Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) circulating tumor cells influence myeloid cell differentiation to support their survival and immunoresistance in portal vein circulation.', 'Colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) inhibitors in cancer therapy.', 'Clinical Development of Colony-Stimulating Factor 1 Receptor (CSF1R) Inhibitors.', 'Blockade of tumor-derived colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF1) promotes an immune-permissive tumor microenvironment.', 'The immunogenic radiation and new players in immunotherapy and targeted therapy for head and neck cancer.', 'Radiotherapy combined with immunotherapy could improve the immune infiltration of melanoma in mice and enhance the abscopal effect.', 'Rapid recruitment and IFN-I-mediated activation of monocytes dictate focal radiotherapy efficacy.', 'Advances in landscape and related therapeutic targets of the prostate tumor microenvironment.']"""

Wild type LNCaP, 22Rv1 prostate cancer cells, prostate stromal cells (PrSC) and LNCaP cells transfected with p-Q640X AR, p-WT AR or p-C3 empty plasmids were studied. The expression of PSMA and PSA were detected by real-time PCR after transfection for 4 and 7 days. Expression of mRNAs for PSA was sixfold greater than PSMA in wild type LNCaP cells.

Non-transfected human PrSC responded similarly to PSMA mRNA and PSA mRNA was not detected in these cells. Q640X AR transfected LNCaP cells downregulated the expression of PSMA and PSA genes after 7 days. Our results demonstrate that Q640X mutated AR may have an important regulatory role in mediating the PSMA and PSA genes expression during the progression of prostate cancer from androgen-dependence to androgen-independence.

We assess the prevalence of CVD risk factors among long-term cancer survivors and compare results to survey data from the general population in the same geographic region. We also characterize how often at-risk survivors discuss CVD-related health behaviors with their health care providers.  Methods:   Survivors (n = 1,582) of breast, prostate, colorectal, and gynecologic cancers, 4-14 years after diagnosis, were recruited from two California cancer registries for a cross-sectional mail survey. We assessed CVD risk factors, including smoking, body mass index, physical inactivity, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, and diabetes, as well as report of discussions with health care providers about diet, exercise, smoking, and lifestyle change assistance.  Results:   With the exception of current smoking, CVD risk factors were more common among survivors than the general adult population. Of survivors, 62.0 % were overweight or obese, 55.0 % reported hypertension, 20.7 % reported diabetes, 18.1 % were inactive, and 5.1 % were current smokers. Compared to white, non-Hispanic survivors, Hispanic (b = 0.37, p = 0.007) and African-American (b = 0.66, p < 0.0001), but not Asian, survivors reported significantly more risk factors. One in three survivors with one or more risk factors for CVD did not report a health promotion discussion with their health care providers.  Conclusions:   CVD risk factors are common among long-term survivors, but many at-risk survivors may not discuss lifestyle prevention with their health care team. Primary care and oncology should work together to deliver optimal survivorship care that addresses CVD risk factors, as well as prevalent disease.  Implications for cancer survivors:   Cardiovascular disease may compromise cancer survivors' long-term health and well-being, yet cardiovascular risk factors may be overlooked during survivorship care. We document that CVD risk factors are common among cancers survivors, yet nearly a third of survivors do not report health promotion discussions with their medical teams.

Methods:   A prospective database was maintained from those men attended the rapid access prostate clinic in St. Vincent's University Hospital.

Cell viability tests, using a wide range of concentrations of soy isoflavones (6-75 μg/ml for 72 h), were conducted to determine their IC50 concentrations. Electron paramagnetic resonance investigations of prostate cancer cell membrane fluidity were performed at IC50 concentrations of genistein and daidzein (12.5 and 25 μg/ml, respectively, for 10 min).

Materials and methods:   Men with at least 1 prior negative prostate biopsy who were scheduled for repeat prostate biopsy based on best clinical judgment were enrolled at 14 centers. Whole blood and post-digital rectal examination urine samples were collected before extended template transrectal biopsy with 12 or more cores. Urinary PCA3 scores and biopsy outcomes were assessed by logistic regression analysis, which also included age, race, serum prostate specific antigen, clinical stage, family history of prostate cancer and the number of previous negative biopsy sessions.  Results:   A total of 466 men were included in study and prostate cancer was identified in 21.9%. A PCA3 score cutoff of 25 yielded 77.5% sensitivity, 57.1% specificity, and negative and positive predictive values of 90% and 33.6%, respectively. On multivariable logistic regression men with a PCA3 score of less than 25 were 4.56 times as likely to have a negative repeat biopsy as men with a score of 25 or greater. PCA3 score significantly increased the predictive accuracy of the logistic regression model. At 90% sensitivity adding the PCA3 score to the model increased specificity, and positive and negative predictive values by 22.6%, 6.4% and 7.1%, respectively, relative to the model without the PCA3 score.  Conclusions:   The PCA3 score supplements serum prostate specific antigen and other clinical information to provide more accurate prediction of repeat biopsy outcome. Thus, it provides clinicians and patients with independent, clinically useful information to make more informed repeat biopsy decisions.""","""['Marc C Gittelman', 'Bernard Hertzman', 'James Bailen', 'Thomas Williams', 'Isaac Koziol', 'Ralph Jonathan Henderson', 'Mitchell Efros', 'Mohamed Bidair', 'John F Ward']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Clinical utility of the PCA3 urine assay in European men scheduled for repeat biopsy.', 'PCA3: a molecular urine assay for predicting prostate biopsy outcome.', 'PCA3 score before radical prostatectomy predicts extracapsular extension and tumor volume.', 'Contemporary role of prostate cancer antigen 3 in the management of prostate cancer.', 'Optimising repeat prostate biopsy decisions and procedures.', 'Targeted Mass Spectrometry Assays for Specific Quantification of Urinary proPSA Isoforms.', 'Urinary PCA3 a Superior Diagnostic Biomarker for Prostate Cancer among Ghanaian Men.', 'UPDATE - 2022 Canadian Urological Association recommendations on prostate cancer screening and early diagnosis Endorsement of the 2021 Cancer Care Ontario guidelines on prostate multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging.', 'Liquid biomarkers for early detection of prostate cancer and summary of available data for their use in African-American men.', 'Tissue- and Liquid-Based Biomarkers in Prostate Cancer Precision Medicine.']"""

Materials and methods:   From January 2005 to January 2012 at least 1 negative transrectal ultrasound guided biopsy was done in 485 patients in our clinical database before proceeding with transperineal template guided mapping biopsy. No study patient had a previous prostate cancer diagnosis. The incidence of patients with 1, 2, or 3 or greater previous transrectal ultrasound guided biopsies was 55.3%, 25.9% and 18.8%, respectively. Transperineal template guided mapping biopsy was done in 74.8% of patients for increasing or occasionally persistently increased prostate specific antigen, in 19.4% for atypical small acinar proliferation and in 5.8% for high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia.  Results:   For the entire study population a median of 59 cores was submitted at transperineal template guided mapping biopsy. Cancer was ultimately detected in 226 patients (46.6%) using the transperineal template guided method, including 196 (86.7%) with clinically significant disease according to the Epstein criteria. The most common cancer detection site on transperineal template guided mapping biopsy was the anterior apex.

Its expression has been shown to be down-regulated in hematopoietic, melanocytic, and mesothelial malignancies. Histone H1.5 is a variant of histone H1, a family of linker proteins that organizes chromosomes into higher order structures. Its function is of key importance in gene expression and has been linked to more aggressive forms of prostatic carcinoma. This study aimed to investigate the immunohistochemical detectability of promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger and histone H1.5 in pulmonary neuroendocrine tumors, comprising 11 carcinoid tumorlets, 24 typical carcinoids, 12 atypical carcinoids, 20 small cell carcinomas, 11 large cell neuroendocrine carcinomas, and 2 combined small cell carcinomas-large cell neuroendocrine carcinomas. Promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger immunohistochemistry revealed moderate or strong nuclear staining in all carcinoid tumorlets, 23 of 24 typical carcinoids, and 7 of 12 atypical carcinoids in contrast to 9 of 11 large cell neuroendocrine carcinomas, all small cell carcinoma, and both combined small cell carcinoma-large cell neuroendocrine carcinomas, which showed no nuclear immunoreactivity. Histone H1.5 immunohistochemistry revealed only focal or no immunoreactivity in all carcinoid tumorlets and 19 of 24 typical carcinoids, whereas 7 of 12 atypical carcinoids, 19 of 20 small cell carcinomas, 10 of 11 large cell neuroendocrine carcinomas, and both combined small cell carcinomas-large cell neuroendocrine carcinomas displayed positive (≥ 10%) nuclear immunoreactivity-ranging from a minority of weak staining to a majority of strong staining cases.

Materials and methods:   In 236 patients treated with radical prostatectomy between June 2011 and September 2012 whole surface frozen section analysis of the removed prostate was done intraoperatively. The apex and base were circumferentially dissected as well as the whole posterolateral tissue corresponding to the neurovascular bundles. Multiple perpendicular sections were cut systematically for frozen section analysis. Pathology results were reported to navigate the procedure.  Results:   Frozen section analysis identified positive surgical margins in 22% of cases, including the neurovascular bundles in 56.9%, apex in 34.5% and base in 8.6%. Of positive frozen section cases 92.3% could be converted to negative status, while 7.7% remained positive. The final positive margin rate in the total cohort was 3%, including a false-negative frozen section rate of 1.6%. In 14.8% of cases the initial nerve sparing plan was changed intraoperatively due to the positive frozen section and the secondary resected specimen detected cancer in 25%. Final pathology results showed Gleason upgrading or up-staging in 40.7% of cases compared to preoperative variables. When comparing patients with positive vs negative frozen sections, preoperative variables did not significantly differ, while postoperatively pathological stage, tumor volume, operative time and final margin status differed significantly. Of patients with exclusively unilateral positive biopsies 13% had a positive surgical margin intraoperatively on the opposite, biopsy negative side.

Materials and methods:   A total of 302 patients with localized prostate cancer treated with image guided intensity modulated radiation therapy between July 2000 and May 2005 were retrospectively analyzed. Risk groups (low, intermediate and high) were designated based on National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines. Biochemical control was based on the American Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology (Phoenix) consensus definition. Chronic toxicity was measured at peak symptoms and at last visit. Toxicity was scored based on Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.  Results:   The median radiation dose delivered was 75.6 Gy (range 70.2 to 77.4) and 35.4% of patients received androgen deprivation therapy.

Materials and methods:   A prospective Harlaching high intensity focused ultrasound database was searched for patients with primary localized prostate cancer (T1-2, N0, M0, PSA at first diagnosis less than 50 ng/ml) and followup longer than 15 months. Those patients with previous long-term androgen deprivation therapy, locally advanced prostate cancer or any therapy influencing prostate specific antigen were excluded from study. All patients were treated completely with an Ablatherm® high intensity focused ultrasound device. Evaluation was performed in aggregate, and by stratification according to cohort group, risk group (D'Amico criteria), prostate specific antigen nadir and Gleason score. The Phoenix definition was used for biochemical failure. Statistical analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method, and univariate and multivariate analysis was performed using a Cox model.  Results:   Of 704 study patients 78.5% had intermediate or high risk disease. Mean followup was 5.3 years (range 1.3 to 14).

Objective:   To evaluate the impact of aRT on UC recovery in patients with unfavourable pathologic characteristics.  Design, setting, and participants:   The study included 361 patients with either pT2 with positive surgical margin(s) or pT3a/pT3b node-negative disease treated with RP at a tertiary care referral centre.  Intervention:   Patients were stratified according to the administration of aRT into two groups: group 1 (no aRT; n=208; 57.8%) and group 2 (aRT; n=153; 42.2%).  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Continence was defined as no use of protective pads. Log-rank test was used to compare the rate of UC recovery according to aRT status. The association between aRT and UC was also tested in Cox regression models after accounting for age, Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment (CAPRA) score, nerve-sparing (NS) status, Charlson Comorbidity Index, body mass index, and year of surgery.  Results and limitations:   At a mean follow-up of 30 mo, 254 patients (70.4%) recovered complete UC. The 1- and 3-yr UC recovery was 51% and 59% for patients submitted to aRT versus 81% and 87% for patients not receiving aRT, respectively (p<0.001). At univariable analysis, older age (p<0.001), presence of non-organ-confined disease (p<0.001), non-NS procedure (p<0.001), and delivery of aRT (p<0.001) were significantly associated with lower UC. At multivariable analysis, the delivery of aRT remained an independent predictor of worse UC recovery (hazard ratio: 0.57; p=0.001). Patients treated with aRT had a 1.6-fold higher risk of incontinence. Younger age (p=0.02), lower CAPRA score (p=0.03), and NS approach (p<0.001) also represented independent predictors of UC recovery. The main limitations of the study are related to the lack of validated questionnaires in the evaluation of UC and in the lack of information regarding UC status at aRT.  Conclusions:   The delivery of aRT has a detrimental effect on UC. The oncologic benefits must be balanced with an impaired UC recovery. Patients should be informed of such impairment before adjuvant treatments are planned.""","""['Nazareno Suardi', 'Andrea Gallina', 'Giuliana Lista', 'Giorgio Gandaglia', 'Firas Abdollah', 'Umberto Capitanio', ""Paolo Dell'Oglio"", 'Alessandro Nini', 'Andrea Salonia', 'Francesco Montorsi', 'Alberto Briganti']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['The potential impact of adjuvant radiation therapy on urinary continence recovery after radical prostatectomy.', ""Reply to Berardino De Bari, Stefano Arcangeli, and Filippo Alongi's letter to the editor re: Nazareno Suardi, Andrea Gallina, Giuliana Lista, et al. impact of adjuvant radiation therapy on urinary continence recovery after radical prostatectomy.

Methods and materials:   Fifty-two patients at 4 institutions were enrolled into a prospective pilot clinical trial. Patients underwent baseline scans and then were injected with perirectal spacing hydrogel and rescanned. Intensity modulated radiation therapy plans were created on both scans for comparison. The objectives were to establish rates of creation of ≥ 7.5 mm of prostate-rectal separation, and decrease in rectal V70 of ≥ 25%. Multiple regression analysis was performed to evaluate the associations between preinjection and postinjection changes in rectal V70 and changes in plan conformity, rectal volume, bladder volume, bladder V70, planning target volume (PTV), and postinjection midgland separation, gel volume, gel thickness, length of PTV/gel contact, and gel left-to-right symmetry.  Results:   Hydrogel resulted in ≥7.5-mm prostate-rectal separation in 95.8% of patients; 95.7% had decreased rectal V70 of ≥ 25%, with a mean reduction of 8.0 Gy. There were no significant differences in preinjection and postinjection prostate, PTV, rectal, and bladder volumes. Plan conformities were significantly different before versus after injection (P=.02); plans with worse conformity indexes after injection compared with before injection (n=13) still had improvements in rectal V70. In multiple regression analysis, greater postinjection reduction in V70 was associated with decreased relative postinjection plan conformity (P=.01). Reductions in V70 did not significantly vary by institution, despite significant interinstitutional variations in plan conformity. There were no significant relationships between reduction in V70 and the other characteristics analyzed.  Conclusions:   Injection of hydrogel into the prostate-rectal interface resulted in dose reductions to rectum for >90% of patients treated. Rectal sparing was statistically significant across a range of 10 to 75 Gy and was demonstrated within the presence of significant interinstitutional variability in plan conformity, target definitions, and injection results.""","""['Danny Y Song', 'Klaus K Herfarth', 'Matthias Uhl', 'Michael J Eble', 'Michael Pinkawa', 'Baukelien van Triest', 'Robin Kalisvaart', 'Damien C Weber', 'Raymond Miralbell', 'Theodore L Deweese', 'Eric C Ford']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['A dosimetric study of polyethylene glycol hydrogel in 200 prostate cancer patients treated with high-dose rate brachytherapy±intensity modulated radiation therapy.', 'Intensity modulated proton and photon therapy for early prostate cancer with or without transperineal injection of a polyethylen glycol spacer: a treatment planning comparison study.', 'Ion therapy of prostate cancer: daily rectal dose reduction by application of spacer gel.', 'Dose-volume analysis of predictors for chronic rectal toxicity after treatment of prostate cancer with adaptive image-guided radiotherapy.', 'High-dose-rate brachytherapy for prostate cancer in a previously radiated patient with polyethylene glycol hydrogel spacing to reduce rectal dose: case report and review of the literature.', 'Toxicity, quality of life, and PSA control after 50 Gy stereotactic body radiation therapy to the dominant intraprostatic nodule with the use of a rectal spacer: results of a phase I/II study.', 'Hyaluronic acid spacer in prostate cancer radiotherapy: dosimetric effects, spacer stability and long-term toxicity and PRO in a phase II study.', 'New modified technique of hydrogel spacer implantation for prostate cancer: a novel method for separation at the prostate apex level under real-time ultrasound guidance.', 'Prostate Cancer Treatment with Pencil Beam Proton Therapy Using Rectal Spacers sans Endorectal Balloons.', 'Comprehensive review of the use of hydrogel spacers prior to radiation therapy for prostate cancer.']"""

To determine if a commercially available technology could provide a transcriptomic profile of a single prostate cancer (PCa) cell, we clonally selected and cultured a single passage of cell cycle synchronized C4-2B PCa cells. Ten sets of single, 5-, or 10-cells were isolated using a micromanipulator under direct visualization with an inverted microscope. Additionally, two groups of 10 individual DTC, each isolated from bone marrow of 2 patients with metastatic PCa were obtained. RNA was amplified using the WT-Ovation™ One-Direct Amplification System. The amplified material was hybridized on a 44K Whole Human Gene Expression Microarray. A high stringency threshold, a mean Alexa Fluor® 3 signal intensity above 300, was used for gene detection. Relative expression levels were validated for select genes using real-time PCR (RT-qPCR).  Results:   Using this approach, 22,410, 20,423, and 17,009 probes were positive on the arrays from 10-cell pools, 5-cell pools, and single-cells, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of gene detection on the single-cell analyses were 0.739 and 0.972 respectively when compared to 10-cell pools, and 0.814 and 0.979 respectively when compared to 5-cell pools, demonstrating a low false positive rate. Among 10,000 randomly selected pairs of genes, the Pearson correlation coefficient was 0.875 between the single-cell and 5-cell pools and 0.783 between the single-cell and 10-cell pools. As expected, abundant transcripts in the 5- and 10-cell samples were detected by RT-qPCR in the single-cell isolates, while lower abundance messages were not. Using the same stringency, 16,039 probes were positive on the patient single-cell arrays. Cluster analysis showed that all 10 DTC grouped together within each patient.  Conclusions:   A transcriptomic profile can be reliably obtained from a single cell using commercially available technology. As expected, fewer amplified genes are detected from a single-cell sample than from pooled-cell samples, however this method can be used to reliably obtain a transcriptomic profile from DTC isolated from the bone marrow of patients with PCa.""","""['Christopher J Welty', 'Ilsa Coleman', 'Roger Coleman', 'Bryce Lakely', 'Jing Xia', 'Shu Chen', 'Roman Gulati', 'Sandy R Larson', 'Paul H Lange', 'Bruce Montgomery', 'Peter S Nelson', 'Robert L Vessella', 'Colm Morrissey']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""BMC Mol Biol""","""['Gene expression analysis of bone metastasis and circulating tumor cells from metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer patients.', 'Characterization of single disseminated prostate cancer cells reveals tumor cell heterogeneity and identifies dormancy associated pathways.', 'A Circulating Tumor Cell-RNA Assay for Assessment of Androgen Receptor Signaling Inhibitor Sensitivity in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'The biology and clinical implications of prostate cancer dormancy and metastasis.', 'Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction for prostate specific antigen in the management of prostate cancer.', ""Tuning Cancer Fate: Tumor Microenvironment's Role in Cancer Stem Cell Quiescence and Reawakening."", 'Live single cell mass spectrometry reveals cancer-specific metabolic profiles of circulating tumor cells.', 'Disseminated tumour cells in bone marrow are the source of cancer relapse after therapy.', 'Prostate Cancer Disseminated Tumor Cells are Rarely Detected in the Bone Marrow of Patients with Localized Disease Undergoing Radical Prostatectomy across Multiple Rare Cell Detection Platforms.', 'Single-cell genomic analysis of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.']"""

An assessment of the promoter CG islands EVX1 and FILIP1L demonstrates a fourfold higher rate of non-CG methylation at EVX1 compared with FILIP1L across all cell lines. These loci are densely methylated at CG sites in cancer.  Results:   No significant difference in non-CG methylation was demonstrated between cancer and normal. Treatment of cancer cell lines with 5-azacytidine significantly reduced methylation within EVX1 at CG and CC sites, preferentially.

Methods:   48 consecutive patients prospectively underwent multiecho T2 weighted (T2W) (echo times 20, 40, 60, 80, 100 ms) and diffusion-weighted (b=0, 100, 300, 500, 800 s mm(-2)) endorectal MRI. In 43 evaluable patients, single slice whole PZ, TZ and tumour (focal hypointense signal on T2W images in a biopsy-positive octant) regions of interest were transferred to T2 and ADC maps by slice matching. T2 and ADC values were correlated, and PZ values were correlated with PZFV.  Results:   T2 and ADC values were significantly different among groups [T2 mean±standard deviation (SD) PZ, 149±49 ms; TZ, 125±26 ms; tumour, 97±23 ms; PZ vs TZ, p=0.002; PZ vs tumour, p<0.0001; TZ vs tumour, p<0.0001; ADC×10(-6) mm(2) s(-1) mean±SD PZ, 1680±215; TZ, 1478±139; tumour, 1030±205; p<0.0001]. Significant positive correlations existed between T2 and ADC for PZ, TZ, PZ and TZ together, but not for tumour (r=0.515, p<0.0001; r=0.300, p=0.03; r=0.526, p<0.0001; and r=0.239, p=0.32, respectively). No significant correlation existed between PZFV and PZ T2 (r=0.10, p=0.5) or ADC (r=0.03, p=0.8).  Conclusion:   The correlation between T2 and ADC that exists in normal prostate is absent in tumour.

While current methods have contributed significantly to our understanding of cell adhesion, these methods are unsuitable for tackling many biological questions requiring intermediate numbers of cells (10(2)-10(5)), including small animal biopsies, clinical samples, and rare cell isolates. To overcome this fundamental limitation, we developed a new assay to quantify the adhesion of ~10(2)-10(3) cells at a time on engineered substrates, and examined the adhesion strength and population heterogeneity via distribution-based modeling. We validated the platform by testing adhesion strength of cancer cells from three different cancer types (breast, prostate, and multiple myeloma) on both IL-1β activated and non-activated endothelial monolayers, and observed significantly increased adhesion for each cancer cell type upon endothelial activation, while identifying and quantifying distinct subpopulations of cell-substrate interactions. We then applied the assay to characterize adhesion of primary bone marrow stromal cells to different cardiac fibroblast-derived matrix substrates to demonstrate the ability to study limited cell populations in the context of cardiac cell-based therapies. Overall, these results demonstrate the sensitivity and robustness of the assay as well as its ability to enable extraction of high content, functional data from limited and potentially rare primary samples.

Molecular mechanisms by which prostate cancer (PC) cells redirect AR signaling to genes that primarily support growth are unclear. A systematic search for critical AR-tethering proteins led to ELK1, an ETS transcription factor of the ternary complex factor subfamily. Although genetically redundant, ELK1 was obligatory for AR-dependent growth and clonogenic survival in both hormone-dependent PC and castration-recurrent PC cells but not for AR-negative cell growth. AR required ELK1 to up-regulate a major subset of its target genes that was strongly and primarily enriched for cell growth functions. AR functioned as a coactivator of ELK1 by association through its A/B domain, bypassing the classical mechanism of ELK1 activation by phosphorylation and without inducing ternary complex target genes. The ELK1-AR synergy per se was ligand-independent, although it required ligand for nuclear localization of AR as targeting the AR A/B domain to the nucleus recapitulated the action of hormone; accordingly, Casodex was a poor antagonist of the synergy. ELK3, the closest substitute for ELK1 in structure/function and genome recognition, did not interact with AR. ELK1 thus directs selective and sustained gene induction that is a substantial and critical component of growth signaling by AR in PC cells.

SOX9 has been shown to mediate ductal morphogenesis in fetal prostate and maintain stem/progenitor cell pools in multiple adult tissues, and has also been linked to PCa and other cancers. SOX9 overexpression resulted in neoplasia in murine prostate and stimulated tumor invasion, similarly to ERG. Moreover, SOX9 depletion in VCaP cells markedly impaired invasion and growth in vitro and in vivo, establishing SOX9 as a critical downstream effector of ERG. Finally, we found that ERG regulated SOX9 indirectly by opening a cryptic AR-regulated enhancer in the SOX9 gene.

Patients with bone metastases frequently develop skeletal-related events (SREs, including radiation to bone, non-vertebral fracture, vertebral fracture, surgery to bone, and spinal cord compression) that are associated with high healthcare costs. This study aims to provide an estimate of the cost per SRE in both the inpatient and outpatient settings in Belgian patients with bone metastases secondary to solid tumors (breast, prostate, and lung cancers).  Methods:   Patients were retrieved from the IMS Hospital Disease database from 2005-2007. Inclusion was based on the International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems Version 9 (ICD-9) diagnosis and/or procedure codes covering patients with breast, prostate, or lung cancer with bone metastases who were hospitalized for one or more SREs. All costs were extrapolated to 2010 using progression in hospitalization costs since 2001. Additional outpatient costs resulting from radiation to bone and diagnostic tests performed in ambulatory settings were estimated by combining published unit costs with resource use data obtained from a Delphi panel.  Results:   The average cost per SRE across solid tumor types based on the weighted average of inpatient and outpatient costs was €2653 for radiation to bone, €5015 for a vertebral fracture, and €7087 for a non-vertebral fracture. Costs were €12,885 and €15,267 for surgery to bone and spinal cord compression, respectively.  Limitations:   No patient follow-up across calendar years could be done. Also, details regarding the exact anatomic sites of SREs were not always available.  Conclusions:   SREs add a substantial cost to the management of patients with bone metastases. Avoiding SREs can lead to important cost-savings for the healthcare payer.""","""['Jean-Jacques Body', 'Pierre Chevalier', 'Oliver Gunther', 'Guy Hechmati', 'Mark Lamotte']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Med Econ""","""['Healthcare costs associated with skeletal-related events in breast cancer patients with bone metastases.', 'The cost of treatment of skeletal-related events in patients with bone metastases from lung cancer.', 'Payer costs for inpatient treatment of pathologic fracture, surgery to bone, and spinal cord compression among patients with multiple myeloma or bone metastasis secondary to prostate or breast cancer.', 'Clinical, economic and humanistic burdens of skeletal-related events associated with bone metastases.', 'Clinical and economic burden of bone metastasis and skeletal-related events in prostate cancer.', 'Fracture Risk of Long Bone Metastases: A Review of Current and New Decision-Making Tools for Prophylactic Surgery.', 'Finite element models for fracture prevention in patients with metastatic bone disease.

Use of an accurate model that incorporates additional risk factors to select persons for screening may identify more persons who have lung cancer or in whom lung cancer will develop.  Methods:   We modified the 2011 lung-cancer risk-prediction model from our Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial to ensure applicability to NLST data; risk was the probability of a diagnosis of lung cancer during the 6-year study period. We developed and validated the model (PLCO(M2012)) with data from the 80,375 persons in the PLCO control and intervention groups who had ever smoked. Discrimination (area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve [AUC]) and calibration were assessed. In the validation data set, 14,144 of 37,332 persons (37.9%) met NLST criteria. For comparison, 14,144 highest-risk persons were considered positive (eligible for screening) according to PLCO(M2012) criteria. We compared the accuracy of PLCO(M2012) criteria with NLST criteria to detect lung cancer. Cox models were used to evaluate whether the reduction in mortality among 53,202 persons undergoing low-dose computed tomographic screening in the NLST differed according to risk.  Results:   The AUC was 0.803 in the development data set and 0.797 in the validation data set. As compared with NLST criteria, PLCO(M2012) criteria had improved sensitivity (83.0% vs. 71.1%, P<0.001) and positive predictive value (4.0% vs. 3.4%, P=0.01), without loss of specificity (62.9% and. 62.7%, respectively; P=0.54); 41.3% fewer lung cancers were missed. The NLST screening effect did not vary according to PLCO(M2012) risk (P=0.61 for interaction).

However, the alternative approach of enhancing the degradation of oncoproteins that are frequently overexpressed in cancers is less developed. Betulinic acid (BA) is a plant-derived small molecule that can increase apoptosis specifically in cancer but not in normal cells, making it an attractive anti-cancer agent. Our results in prostate cancer suggested that BA inhibited multiple deubiquitinases (DUBs), which resulted in the accumulation of poly-ubiquitinated proteins, decreased levels of oncoproteins, and increased apoptotic cell death. In normal fibroblasts, however, BA did not inhibit DUB activity nor increased total poly-ubiquitinated proteins, which was associated with a lack of effect on cell death. In the TRAMP transgenic mouse model of prostate cancer, treatment with BA (10 mg/kg) inhibited primary tumors, increased apoptosis, decreased angiogenesis and proliferation, and lowered androgen receptor and cyclin D1 protein. BA treatment also inhibited DUB activity and increased ubiquitinated proteins in TRAMP prostate cancer but had no effect on apoptosis or ubiquitination in normal mouse tissues.

Arginine levels are regulated by the arginine-catabolizing enzyme, arginase (ARG). It has been reported that arginase II (ARG2), one of two ARGs, is aberrantly expressed in prostate cancer cells, which convert arginine into ornithine, resulting in a lack of arginine that weakens tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and renders them dysfunctional. However, immune suppression mediated by ARG2-expressing cancer cells in lung cancer has not been observed. Here we studied the expression of ARG2 in pancreatic ductal carcinoma (PDC) tissue clinicopathologically by examining over 200 cases of PDC. In contrast to prostate cancer, ARG2 expression was rarely demonstrated in PDC cells by immunohistochemistry, and instead ARG2 was characteristically expressed in α-smooth muscle actin-positive cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), especially those located within and around necrotic areas in PDC. The presence of ARG2-expressing CAFs was closely correlated with shorter overall survival (OS; P = 0.003) and disease-free survival (DFS; P = 0.0006). Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that the presence of ARG2-expressing CAFs in PDC tissue was an independent predictor of poorer OS (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.582, P = 0.007) and DFS (HR = 1.715, P = 0.001) in PDC patients. In addition to the characteristic distribution of ARG2-expressing CAFs, such CAFs co-expressed carbonic anhydrase IX, SLC2A1, or HIF-1α, markers of hypoxia, in PDC tissue. Furthermore, in vitro experiments revealed that cultured fibroblasts extracted from PDC tissue expressed the ARG2 transcript after exposure to hypoxia, which had arginase activity. These results indicate that cancer cell-mediated immune suppression through ARG2 expression is not a general event and that the presence of ARG2-expressing CAFs is an indicator of poor prognosis, as well as hypoxia, in PDC tissue.""","""['Yoshinori Ino', 'Rie Yamazaki-Itoh', 'Seiji Oguro', 'Kazuaki Shimada', 'Tomoo Kosuge', 'Jan Zavada', 'Yae Kanai', 'Nobuyoshi Hiraoka']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['The prognostic and therapeutic implications of distinct patterns of argininosuccinate synthase 1 (ASS1) and arginase-2 (ARG2) expression by cancer cells and tumor stroma in non-small-cell lung cancer.', 'Podoplanin expression in cancer-associated fibroblasts enhances tumor progression of invasive ductal carcinoma of the pancreas.', 'Arginase 2 is expressed by human lung cancer, but it neither induces immune suppression, nor affects disease progression.', 'Cancer-associated fibroblasts in pancreatic adenocarcinoma.', 'Recent advances in understanding cancer-associated fibroblasts in pancreatic cancer.', 'A Quick Guide to CAF Subtypes in Pancreatic Cancer.', 'In-silico studies to recognize repurposing therapeutics toward arginase-I inhibitors as a potential onco-immunomodulators.', 'Arginase 2 negatively regulates sorafenib-induced cell death by mediating ferroptosis in melanoma.', 'A cancer-associated fibroblast gene signature predicts prognosis and therapy response in patients with pancreatic cancer.', 'Modulation of the antitumor immune response by cancer-associated fibroblasts: mechanisms and targeting strategies to hamper their immunosuppressive functions.']"""

From a serendipitous to systematic or rational ways, a variety of unimodal computational approaches have been developed but the complexity of the problem clearly needs multi-modal approaches for better solutions. In this study, we propose an integrative computational framework based on classical structure-based drug design and chemical-genomic similarity methods, combined with molecular graph theories for this task. Briefly, a pharmacophore modeling method was employed to guide the selection of docked poses resulting from our high-throughput virtual screening. We then evaluated if complementary results (hits missed by docking) can be obtained by using a novel chemo-genomic similarity approach based on chemical/sequence information. Finally, we developed a bipartite-graph based on the extensive data curation of DrugBank, PDB, and UniProt. This drug-target bipartite graph was used to assess similarity of different inhibitors based on their connections to other compounds and targets. The approaches were applied to the repurposing of existing drugs against ACK1, a novel cancer target significantly overexpressed in breast and prostate cancers during their progression. Upon screening of ∼1,447 marketed drugs, a final set of 10 hits were selected for experimental testing. Among them, four drugs were identified as potent ACK1 inhibitors. Especially the inhibition of ACK1 by Dasatinib was as strong as IC(50)=1nM. We anticipate that our novel, integrative strategy can be easily extended to other biological targets with a more comprehensive coverage of known bio-chemical space for repurposing studies.""","""['Sharangdhar S Phatak', 'Shuxing Zhang']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Pac Symp Biocomput""","""[""Pharmacophore modeling and virtual screening in search of novel Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitors."", 'Multiscale Virtual Screening Optimization for Shotgun Drug Repurposing Using the CANDO Platform.', 'Predicting kinase inhibitors using bioactivity matrix derived informer sets.', 'Rational drug repurposing for cancer by inclusion of the unbiased molecular dynamics simulation in the structure-based virtual screening approach: Challenges and breakthroughs.', 'Computational Approaches Towards Kinases as Attractive Targets for Anticancer Drug Discovery and Development.', 'Domain Architecture of the Nonreceptor Tyrosine Kinase Ack1.', 'Identification of Activated Cdc42-Associated Kinase Inhibitors as Potential Anticancer Agents Using Pharmacoinformatic Approaches.', 'Chemical Reactivity and Optical and Pharmacokinetics Studies of 14 Multikinase Inhibitors and Their Docking Interactions Toward ACK1 for Precision Oncology.', 'Identification of downstream signaling cascades of ACK1 and prognostic classifiers in non-small cell lung cancer.', 'Combined inhibition of ACK1 and AKT shows potential toward targeted therapy against KRAS-mutant non-small-cell lung cancer.']"""

The soluble pattern recognition receptor long pentraxin-3 (PTX3) acts as a natural FGF antagonist that binds FGF2 and FGF8b via its N-terminal domain. We demonstrate that recombinant PTX3 protein and the PTX3-derived pentapeptide Ac-ARPCA-NH2 abolish the mitogenic response of murine TRAMP-C2 cells and human LNCaP prostate cancer cells to DHT and FGFs. Also, PTX3 hampers the angiogenic activity of DHT-activated TRAMP-C2 cells on the chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane (CAM). Accordingly, human PTX3 overexpression inhibits the mitogenic activity exerted by DHT or FGFs on hPTX3_TRAMP-C2 cell transfectants and their angiogenic activity. Also, hPTX3_TRAMP-C2 cells show a dramatic decrease of their angiogenic and tumourigenic potential when grafted in syngeneic or immunodeficient athymic male mice. A similar inhibitory effect is observed when TRAMP-C2 cells overexpress only the FGF-binding N-terminal PTX3 domain. In keeping with the anti-tumour activity of PTX3 in experimental prostate cancer, immunohistochemical analysis of prostate needle biopsies from primary prostate adenocarcinoma patients shows that parenchymal PTX3 expression, abundant in basal cells of normal glands, is lost in high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and in invasive tumour areas.

Methods:   We examined the paracrine stimulation of cell proliferation by prostate tumor cells and its modulation by androgen and estrogens in a murine endothelial cell line (MEC) that does not express AR.  Results:   Tumor cell conditioned media (TCM) collected from LAPC-4 or LNCaP prostatic tumor cells produced a time- and concentration-dependent induction of cell growth in MECs, which was parallel to the VEGF concentration in the TCM. This TCM-induced cell growth in MECs was enhanced by the treatment of prostatic tumor cells with dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Both the TCM-stimulation and DHT-enhancement effects in MECs were completely blocked by SU5416, a specific VEGF receptor antagonist. Co-administration of 17α-estradiol or 17β-estradiol with DHT in prostatic tumor cells completely inhibited the DHT-enhancement effect while treatment with DHT, 17α-estradiol or 17β-estradiol did not produce any significant direct effect in MECs. Moreover, administration of 17α-estradiol or 17β-estradiol in xenograft animals with LAPC-4 or LNCaP prostate tumor significantly decreased the microvessel number in the tumor tissues.  Conclusions:   Our study indicated that prostate tumor cells regulate endothelial cell growth through a paracrine mechanism, which is mainly mediated by VEGF; and DHT is able to modulate endothelial cell growth via tumor cells, which is inhibited by 17α-estradiol and 17β-estradiol.

Using a model derived from PC-3 prostate cancer cells, the highly tumorigenic, metastatic, and chemoresistant clone PC-3/Mc expressed higher levels of the AC ASAH1 than the nonmetastatic clone PC-3/S. Stable knockdown of ASAH1 in PC-3/Mc cells caused an accumulation of ceramides, inhibition of clonogenic potential, increased requirement for growth factors, and inhibition of tumorigenesis and lung metastases.

Methods:   We retrospectively evaluated 379 Japanese patients with pT2-3N0/X prostate cancer undergoing radical prostatectomy from 2000 to 2010 at a single academic institution. Cox proportional hazards model was used to determine whether advanced age is a predictor of biochemical recurrence according to pathological stage.  Results:   The mean age at radical prostatectomy was 65.8 years. With a mean follow-up of 49.8 months, 61 men (16.1%) experienced biochemical recurrence. Martingale residual analysis showed that the adverse prognostic effect of age on biochemical recurrence fits a linear model, and patients were classified into two groups using a cut-off point of age 70 years. Although older patients had higher rates of biochemical recurrence than younger ones in the case of pT2 patients (P = 0.049), advanced age itself was not an independent predictor of biochemical recurrence among the total cohort. However, especially in pT2 patients with negative surgical margins, advanced age was an independent predictor of biochemical recurrence (HR = 3.97, P = 0.006). In these patients, 2- and 5-year biochemical recurrence-free survival rates were 98.0 and 92.4% for younger patients and 93.2 and 82.0% for older patients, respectively (log-rank P = 0.015). On the other hand, in pT3 patients, there was no significant association between age and biochemical recurrence.  Conclusions:   Advanced age is an independent predictor of biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy in Japanese patients with stage pT2 disease and negative surgical margins.

Notwithstanding, the need to identify the determinants behind PSA-testing decisions, the number of studies that have examined factors affecting the physicians' decision as to whether PSA-testing should be ordered are few. The aim of the current study was to investigate how physician- and patient-related factors influence Swedish primary care physicians' decision to order a PSA test for men harboring no symptoms of prostate cancer within different age groups.  Methods:   A total of 305 physicians filled out the study questionnaire containing items about physicians' attitudes towards PSA-testing and the probability of screening men within different age groups.  Results:   The majority of physicians reported positive attitude towards PSA-testing. However, the likelihood of offering PSA-testing to young men was low, but increased with age. Physicians' opinion about PSA-test as a sufficient screening tool was the only variable affecting physicians' decision of ordering PSA-test regardless of patient age. The level of the patients' worry, and patients request were the most influential factors in age groups between 40 and 70 years old. Patients' physical symptoms were an indicator in age groups above 60 years.  Conclusion:   The decision to screen for prostate cancer using the PSA-test is influenced by several factors and not only those having direct clinical indication for prostate disease.

However, tumor-mediated immunosuppressive mechanisms might represent an obstacle to optimal performance of this therapy. We have recently shown that monocytes from the blood of prostate cancer patients can fully mature to dendritic cells only after the tumor is removed. Here, we have tested the hypothesis that these tumor-driven monocytes correspond to the recently described subset of CD14(+) HLA-DR(low) immunosuppressor cells.  Methods:   Prostate cancer patients were studied before and 1 month after prostatectomy. Pre- and postsurgical patients with colorectal cancer were also included for comparison. Flow cytometric analysis was applied to define CD14(-) HLA-DR(low) CD33(+) CD11b(+) (myeloid) and CD14(+) HLA-DR(low) (monocytic) suppressor cells. Interferon-γ release was used to assess the immunocompetence of lymphocytes.  Results:   In both prostate cancer and colorectal cancer patients, the percentage of CD14(+) HLA-DR(low) cells was several-fold higher compared with normal subjects. This was not the case for CD14(-) HLA-DR(low) CD33(+) CD11b(+) cells. Furthermore, postsurgical normalization of CD14(+) HLA-DR(low) cells only occurred in prostate cancer patients. In all patients, the interferon-γ response of T lymphocytes to phorbolmyristate acetate-ionomycin was higher compared with normal donors, but it was further increased after tumor ablation only in prostate cancer patients.  Conclusions:   The direct link between CD14(+) HLA-DR(low) increase and presence of primary tumor suggests a distinguishing immunosuppressive profile of prostate cancer.

Simultaneous expression of three or more proteins occurred in 81% of lethal prostate cancer metastases and BCL-2, cytoplasmic survivin and MCL-1 were co-expressed in 71% of metastatic sites. An unsupervised cluster analysis separated bone and soft tissue metastases according to patterns of survival protein expression. BCL-2, cytoplasmic survivin and MCL-1 had significantly higher expression in bone metastases (p < 10(-5)), while nuclear survivin was significantly higher in soft tissue metastases (p = 3 × 10(-14)).

In addition, the expression of MCL-1 was significantly higher in AR-positive tumours. Neuroendocrine differentiation was not associated with specific survival pathways. These studies show that bone and soft tissue metastases from the same patient differ significantly in expression of a panel of survival proteins and that with regard to survival protein expression, expression is associated with the metastatic site and not the patient.

Moreover, the nanoparticles were taken up by prostate cancer cells (PC3 and LNCaP) in a dose-dependent manner, which was higher in case of R11-PMNPs than PMNPs. Further, in vivo biodistribution of the nanoparticles showed significantly more R11-PMNPs accumulation in tumors than other vital organs unlike PMNPs without R11 conjugation. Moreover, R11-PMNPs decreased 30% magnetic resonance T2 signal intensity in tumors in vivo compared to 0% decrease with PMNPs. These results indicate great potential of R11-PMPs as platform technology to target and monitor prostate cancers for diagnostic and therapeutic applications.""","""['Aniket S Wadajkar', 'Jyothi U Menon', 'Yuh-Shyan Tsai', 'Crystal Gore', 'Timothy Dobin', 'Leah Gandee', 'Kim Kangasniemi', 'Masaya Takahashi', 'Bikash Manandhar', 'Jung-Mo Ahn', 'Jer-Tsong Hsieh', 'Kytai T Nguyen']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Biomaterials""","""['Synthesis of a cell penetrating peptide modified superparamagnetic iron oxide and MRI detection of bladder cancer.', 'Dual-responsive polymer-coated iron oxide nanoparticles for drug delivery and imaging applications.', 'Cellular level loading and heating of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles.', 'Nanoparticles for cancer therapy using magnetic forces.', 'Magnetic nanoparticle hyperthermia for prostate cancer.', 'Preparation and characterization of peptide modified ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxides used as tumor targeting MRI contrast agent.', 'Recent applications of cell-penetrating peptide guidance of nanosystems in breast and prostate cancer.', 'Design of Magnetic Nanoplatforms for Cancer Theranostics.', 'Ferrimagnetic mPEG-b-PHEP copolymer micelles loaded with iron oxide nanocubes and emodin for enhanced magnetic hyperthermia-chemotherapy.', ""Bioresponsive Nanomedicine: The Next Step of Deadliest Cancers' Theranostics.""]"""

Patients and methods:   In all, 500 patients underwent ePLND for intermediate- or high-risk prostate cancer by one surgeon during a 48-month period. A transperitoneal laparoscopic approach was used in all patients to allow adequate access to the internal iliac vessels. The variables chosen as being the most important discriminators of the quality of ePLND were operating time, complication rate and lymph node (LN) yield. The learning curves for ePLND were calculated using the cumulative sum and cumulative average methods and the number of procedures performed until attainment of acceptable failure rates (competence levels) was calculated. LN parameters were compared with the results from the preceding 311 cases where limited PLND was undertaken.  Results:   The median (range) preoperative PSA level was 8.0(1-62.5) ng/mL and biopsy Gleason score was 7(6-10). In all, 64% of patients had intermediate-risk and 36% had high-risk prostate cancer. There were no intraoperative blood transfusions and no conversions to open surgery. The median (range) blood loss was 200(10-1400) mL and the postoperative transfusion rate was 1.6%. The operating time fell at a steady rate of 2.7% after the 15th case and plateaued after 130 patients. At competence levels of 5% and 10%, the learning curve for all complications ended after 346 and 136 patients, respectively. At a 5% competence level the learning curve for PLND-specific complications was 40 cases and there was no learning curve at a 10% competence level. The overall complication rate was 7.2% of which almost half (47%) were deemed to be PLND-specific. The cumulative average of the LN counts plateaued after 150 procedures. Furthermore, the median LN count after ePLND was more than double that of the authors' historical standard PLND controls (14 vs 6, P < 0.001) and increased with experience up to the end of the series (9 to 20). The likelihood of LN involvement (LNI) correlated with biopsy and pathological Gleason grade, clinical and pathological stage and d'Amico risk group.  Conclusions:   This study suggests a learning curve of ≈130 cases for operating time, 136 cases for all complications, 40 cases for PLND-specific complications and 150 cases for LN yield. The risk of LNI for patients with intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer was 8.4% and 19.4%, respectively, which suggests that a significant proportion would benefit from ePLND. It also shows that ePLND can be safely incorporated into LRP, and therefore also into robot-assisted RP, in a high-volume setting.""","""['Christopher G Eden', 'Evangelos Zacharakis', 'Simon Bott']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Extended vs standard pelvic lymphadenectomy during laparoscopic radical prostatectomy for intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer.', 'Standardized comparison of robot-assisted limited and extended pelvic lymphadenectomy for prostate cancer.', 'Extended pelvic lymphadenectomy in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy: high incidence of lymph node metastasis.', 'Anatomical extent of pelvic lymphadenectomy in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy.', 'Laparoscopic radical prostatectomy: a critical analysis of surgical quality.', 'The learning curves of major laparoscopic and robotic procedures in urology: a systematic review.', 'Complications of Extended Pelvic Lymph Node Dissection in Patients Undergoing Minimally Invasive Radical Prostatectomy: Analysis and Risk Factors.', 'The Influence of Lymph Node Count on Oncological Outcome of Radical Cystectomy in Chemotherapy Pre-Treated and Chemotherapy-Naïve Patients with Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer.', 'The Establishment of New Thresholds for PLND-Validated Clinical Nomograms to Predict Non-Regional Lymph Node Metastases: Using 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT as References.', 'Consensus statement on definition, diagnosis, and management of high-risk prostate cancer patients on behalf of the Spanish Groups of Uro-Oncology Societies URONCOR, GUO, and SOGUG.']"""

Methods:   Between August 2006 and September 2011, a cohort of 244 men underwent robot-assisted radical prostatectomy carried out by a single surgeon. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were carried out to identify clinical covariates significantly associated with an increased positive surgical margin. The preoperative variables included age, body mass index, prostate-specific antigen level, prostate-specific antigen density, clinical T stage, prostate volume, surgeon volume, number of positive cores and percentage of positive cores.  Results:   In the univariate analyses, serum prostate-specific antigen level, prostate-specific antigen density and surgeon volume were significantly associated with positive surgical margin. In the multivariate analysis, prostate-specific antigen density (hazard ratio 3.13, 95% confidence interval 1.57-6.24; P = 0.001) and surgeon volume (hazard ratio 2.15, 95% confidence interval 1.06-4.35; P = 0.034) were independent predictive factors for positive surgical margin. Using these two independent factors, we divided the patients into four groups and calculated the predictive probability of positive surgical margin. The predictive probability for positive surgical margin in each group was well correlated with the rates at 10.8% and 10.2%, 19.8% and 20.0%, 26.4% and 26.4%, an 43.5% and 43.3%, respectively.

The AIHW publishes updated information on survival and prevalence of cancer in Australia on a regular basis.  Methods:   The latest national survival and prevalence statistics for cancer in Australia from 1982 to 2010 are presented. The period method is used in survival calculations. Limited duration prevalence by sex and 5-year relative survival by age, sex, remoteness from major centers and socioeconomic status are examined in detail for all cancers combined as well as for selected cancers. National conditional survival statistics are also presented.  Results:   Five-year survival from all cancers combined increased from 47% in the period 1982-1987 to 66% in 2006-2010. Over the same period, prostate cancer, kidney cancer and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma had the largest increases in 5-year survival, while many of the cancers that already had a low survival in 1982-1987 (such as mesothelioma and pancreatic cancer) showed only small increases. For those who have already survived 5 years past their cancer diagnosis, their survival prospects for the next 5 years were more than 90% for all cancers combined. At the end of 2007 there were 774 700 Australians, or 3.6% of the population, living with a diagnosis of cancer in the previous 26 years.

Eb III was isolated from Onobrychis ebenoides of the Leguminosae family, a plant endemic in Central and Southern Greece. We have previously reported that Eb III exerts significant cytotoxic effects on certain cancer cell lines. This effect is thought to occur via the isoprenyl moiety at the C-5 position of the molecule. The study aim was to gain a deeper understanding of the pharmacological effect of Eb III on DU-145 cell death at the translational level using a relative quantitative and temporal proteomics approach. Proteins extracted from the cell pellets were subjected to solution phase trypsin proteolysis followed by iTRAQ-labeling. The labeled tryptic peptide extracts were then fractionated using strong cation exchange chromatography and the fractions were analyzed by nanoflow reverse phase ultraperformance liquid chromatography-nanoelectrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry analysis using a hybrid QqTOF platform. Using this approach, we compared the expression levels of 1360 proteins analyzed at ≤ 1% global protein false discovery rate (FDR), commonly present in untreated (control, vehicle only) and Eb III-treated cells at the different exposure time points. Through the iterative use of Ingenuity Pathway Analysis with hierarchical clustering of protein expression patterns, followed by bibliographic research, the temporal regulation of the Calpain-1, ERK2, PAR-4, RAB-7, and Bap31 proteins were identified as potential nodes of multipathway convergence to Eb III induced DU-145 cell death. These proteins were further verified with Western blot analysis. This gel-free, quantitative 2DLC-MS/MS proteomics method effectively captured novel modulated proteins in the DU-145 cell line as a response to Eb III treatment.

However, for more than five decades investigators have failed to identify a single cause-and-effect factor, which could be implicated; identification of a causative entity would allow the implementation of an intervention strategy in at-risk populations. This suggests a more complex pathoaetiology for these cancer sites, compared to others. When one examines the increases or decreases in incidence of specific cancers amongst migrant populations, it is notable that disease arising in colon or stomach requires one or at most two generations to exhibit a change in incidence to match that of high-incidence regions, whereas for breast or prostate cancer, at least three generations are required. This generational threshold could suggest a requirement for nonmutation-driven epigenetic alterations in the F0/F1 generations (parental/offspring adopting a more westernized lifestyle), which then predisposes the inherited genome of subsequent generations to mutagenic/genotoxic alterations leading to the development of sporadic cancer in these target sites. As such, individual susceptibility to carcinogen insult would not be based per se on polymorphisms in activating/detoxifying/repair enzymes, but on elevated accessibility of crucial target genes (e.g., oncogenes, tumour suppressor genes) or hotspots therein to mutation events. This could be termed a genomic susceptibility organizational structure (SOS). Several exposures including alcohol and heavy metals are epigens (i.e., modifiers of the epigenome), whereas others are mutagenic/genotoxic, for example, heterocyclic aromatic amines; humans are continuously and variously exposed to mixtures of these agents. Within such a transgenerational multistage model of cancer development, determining the interaction between epigenetic modification to generate a genomic SOS and genotoxic insult will facilitate a new level of understanding in the aetiology of cancer.""","""['Francis L Martin']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""ISRN Oncol""","""['Environmental and chemical carcinogenesis.', 'Transgenerational inheritance: how impacts to the epigenetic and genetic information of parents affect offspring health.', 'Epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) for potential transgenerational disease epigenetic biomarkers in sperm following ancestral exposure to the pesticide methoxychlor.', 'Environmental Toxicant Induced Epigenetic Transgenerational Inheritance of Prostate Pathology and Stromal-Epithelial Cell Epigenome and Transcriptome Alterations: Ancestral Origins of Prostate Disease.', 'Transgenerational Inheritance of Environmentally Induced Epigenetic Alterations during Mammalian Development.', 'Carcinogenicity assessment: Addressing the challenges of cancer and chemicals in the environment.', 'Carcinogens and DNA damage.', 'Cancer-related risk factors and incidence of major cancers by race, gender and region; analysis of the NIH-AARP diet and health study.', 'A biospectroscopic analysis of human prostate tissue obtained from different time periods points to a trans-generational alteration in spectral phenotype.', 'Unexplored potentials of epigenetic mechanisms of plants and animals-theoretical considerations.']"""

Recombinant human Apo2L/TRAIL has been under clinical trials, whereas various kinds of malignant tumors have resistance to Apo2L/TRAIL. We and others have shown that several anticancer agents and flavonoids overcome resistance to Apo2L/TRAIL by upregulating death receptor 5 (DR5) in malignant tumor cells. However, the mechanisms by which these compounds induce DR5 expression remain unknown. Here we show that the dietary flavonoid apigenin binds and inhibits adenine nucleotide translocase-2 (ANT2), resulting in enhancement of Apo2L/TRAIL-induced apoptosis by upregulation of DR5. Apigenin and genistein, which are major flavonoids, enhanced Apo2L/TRAIL-induced apoptosis in cancer cells. Apigenin induced DR5 expression, but genistein did not. Using our method identifying the direct targets of flavonoids, we compared the binding proteins of apigenin with those of genistein. We discovered that ANT2 was a target of apigenin, but not genistein. Similarly to apigenin, knockdown of ANT2 enhanced Apo2L/TRAIL-induced apoptosis by upregulating DR5 expression at the post-transcriptional level. Moreover, silencing of ANT2 attenuated the enhancement of Apo2L/TRAIL-induced apoptosis by apigenin. These results suggest that apigenin upregulates DR5 and enhances Apo2L/TRAIL-induced apoptosis by binding and inhibiting ANT2.

Here, we show that oral feeding of betel leaf extract (BLE) significantly inhibited the growth of human prostate xenografts implanted in nude mice compared with vehicle-fed controls. To gain insights into the 'active principles', we performed a bioactivity-guided fractionation of methanolic BLE employing solvents of different polarity strengths using classical column chromatography. This approach yielded 15 fractions, which were then pooled to 10 using similar retention factors on thin-layer chromatographs. Bioactivity assays demonstrated that one fraction in particular, F2, displayed a 3-fold better in vitro efficacy to inhibit proliferation of prostate cancer cells than the parent BLE. The presence of phenols, hydroxychavicol (HC) and chavibetol (CHV), was confirmed in F2 by nuclear magnetic resonance, high-performance liquid chromatography and mass spectroscopy. Further, the HC containing F2 subfraction was found to be ~8-fold more potent than the F2 subfraction that contained CHV, in human prostate cancer PC-3 cells as evaluated by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazole-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide assay. Removing CHV from F2 remarkably decreased the IC50 of this fraction, indicating that HC is perhaps the major bioactive constituent, which is present to an extent of 26.59% in BLE.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the frequency and natural history of extraintestinal cancer and their risk factors in patients after IPAA for IBD.  Methods:   All patients after IPAA with underlying IBD and extraintestinal neoplasia were identified from a prospectively maintained 932-case Pouchitis Registry from 2002 to 2010. The study group consisted of patients with de novo extraintestinal cancer, which developed after IPAA. Controls were those without extraintestinal cancer, who were randomly selected from the registry with a case to control ratio of 1 to 4. Thirty-one demographic and clinical data were compared between the study and control groups.  Results:   Twenty-eight patients with de novo extraintestinal cancer after IPAA were identified, with a mean duration of pouch construction of 8.2 ± 9.7 years. The cumulative frequency of de novo extraintestinal cancer in patients after IPAA for IBD was 3%, consisting of cancer of the breast (18%), kidney (14%), prostate (11%), thyroid (11%), and bladder (7%); melanoma (11%); and other cancers (28%). The mean age of the study group was 57.6 ± 10.1 years, with 16 (57%) being men; 8 (29%) were consuming tobacco, and 3 (11%) having preoperative and/or postoperative biologic use. Patient age, left-sided colitis, and duration of IBD before IPAA were significantly greater in patients in the study group than in controls (P < 0.05) in univariate analysis. Preoperative or postoperative use of biologics and a preoperative diagnosis of colonic neoplasia were not shown to be associated with extraintestinal cancer. The prevalence seemed to be increased in patients with renal cancer with the standardized prevalence ratio of 4.8 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.6-12.2). In the logistic regression model, older age (odds ratio [OR] = 1.5; 95% CI, 1.2-1.8), left-sided colitis (OR = 12.3; 95% CI, 2.2-67.8), and chronic pouch inflammation (OR = 4.4; 95% CI, 1.5-12.9) were associated with the risk for extraintestinal cancer. The 1-year and 2-year mortality rates after cancer diagnosis were 7.1% and 10.7%, respectively. There was no difference in pouch failure rate between the 2 groups (4% versus 5%; P = 1.00).  Conclusion:   The observed number of cases of renal cancer in patients after IPAA appeared to be greater than the expected number of cases in the general population. Older age and chronic pouch inflammation may be associated with an increased risk for extraintestinal cancer in this cohort.

This is achieved by finding corresponding structures in the preoperative scans and on the live surgical scene. In robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP), the most readily visible structure is the bone of the pelvic rim. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the modality of choice for prostate cancer detection and staging, but extraction of bone from MRI is difficult and very time consuming to achieve manually. We present a robust and fully automated multi-atlas pipeline for bony pelvis segmentation from MRI, using a MRI appearance embedding statistical deformation model (AE-SDM). The statistical deformation model is built using the node positions of deformations obtained from hierarchical registrations of full pelvis CT images. For datasets with corresponding CT and MRI images, we can transform the MRI into CT SDM space. MRI appearance can then be used to improve the combined MRI/CT atlas to MRI registration using SDM constraints. We can use this model to segment the bony pelvis in a new MRI image where there is no CT available. A multi-atlas segmentation algorithm is introduced which incorporates MRI AE-SDMs guidance. We evaluated the method on 19 subjects with corresponding MRI and manually segmented CT datasets by performing a leave-one-out study. Several metrics are used to quantify the overlap between the automatic and manual segmentations. Compared to the manual gold standard segmentations, our robust segmentation method produced an average surface distance 1.24±0.27mm, which outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms for MRI bony pelvis segmentation. We also show that the resulting surface can be tracked in the endoscopic view in near real time using dense visual tracking methods. Results are presented on a simulation and a real clinical RALP case. Tracking is accurate to 0.13mm over 700 frames compared to a manually segmented surface. Our method provides a realistic and robust framework for intraoperative alignment of a bony pelvis model from diagnostic quality MRI images to the endoscopic view.""","""['Qinquan Gao', 'Ping-Lin Chang', 'Daniel Rueckert', 'S Mohammed Ali', 'Daniel Cohen', 'Philip Pratt', 'Erik Mayer', 'Guang-Zhong Yang', 'Ara Darzi', 'Philip Eddie Edwards']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Comput Med Imaging Graph""","""['Effect of bony pelvic dimensions measured by preoperative magnetic resonance imaging on performing robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy.', 'Adaptive local multi-atlas segmentation: application to the heart and the caudate nucleus.', 'Fine-tuning robot-assisted radical prostatectomy planning with MRI.', 'Automated brain structure segmentation based on atlas registration and appearance models.', 'Image-guided robotic interventions for prostate cancer.', 'U-Net Modelling-Based Imaging MAP Score for Tl Stage Nephrectomy: An Exploratory Study.', 'A female pelvic bone shape model for air/bone separation in support of synthetic CT generation for radiation therapy.', '""Advances in the surgical management of bone tumors"".']"""

The lifetime survival functions for the cancer cohort and age-/sex-matched reference population were generated using a semi-parametric extrapolation method with annual life tables. The average expected years of life lost (EYLL) for cancers were calculated by subtracting the estimated life expectancy of the cancer cohorts from that of the reference population.  Results:   Liver cancer and lung cancer had an average EYLL of over 13 years, while the EYLL for prostate cancer was below 2 years. When considering the annual incidence in 2012, lung cancer would cause the greatest subtotal of EYLL (3,116,000 years) followed by female breast cancer (1,420,000 years) and colorectal cancer (932,000 years).

This aberration leads to the ectopic activation of the PI3K-Akt pathway, which promotes tumor growth. Here, we show that the transcription factor Gata3 is progressively lost in Pten-deficient mouse prostate tumors as a result of both transcriptional down-regulation and increased proteasomal degradation. To determine the significance of this loss, we used conditional loss- and gain-of-function approaches to manipulate Gata3 expression levels in prostate tumors. Our results show that Gata3 inactivation in Pten-deficient prostates accelerates tumor invasion. Conversely, enforced expression of GATA3 in Pten-deficient tissues markedly delays tumor progression. In Pten-deficient prostatic ducts, enforced GATA3 prevented Akt activation, which correlated with the down-regulation of Pik3cg and Pik3c2a mRNAs, encoding respectively class I and II PI3K subunits. Remarkably, the majority of human prostate tumors similarly show loss of active GATA3 as they progress to the aggressive castrate-resistant stage. In addition, GATA3 expression levels in hormone-sensitive tumors holds predictive value for tumor recurrence. Together, these data establish Gata3 as an important regulator of prostate cancer progression.""","""['Alana H T Nguyen', 'Mathieu Tremblay', 'Katharina Haigh', 'Ismaël Hervé Koumakpayi', 'Marilène Paquet', 'Pier Paolo Pandolfi', 'Anne-Marie Mes-Masson', 'Fred Saad', 'Jody J Haigh', 'Maxime Bouchard']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Hum Mol Genet""","""['The influence of growth hormone/insulin-like growth factor deficiency on prostatic dysplasia in pbARR2-Cre, PTEN knockout mice.', 'Loss of ATF3 promotes Akt activation and prostate cancer development in a Pten knockout mouse model.', 'Timp3 loss accelerates tumour invasion and increases prostate inflammation in a mouse model of prostate cancer.', 'PTEN, more than the AKT pathway.', 'AKT and cytosolic phospholipase A2α form a positive loop in prostate cancer cells.', 'Interactive webtool for analyzing drug sensitivity and resistance associated with genetic signatures of cancer cell lines.', 'In Vivo Models for Prostate Cancer Research.', 'PTEN Protein Phosphatase Activity Is Not Required for Tumour Suppression in the Mouse Prostate.', 'Precision intervention for prostate cancer: Re-evaluating who is at risk.', 'GATA3 and MDM2 are synthetic lethal in estrogen receptor-positive breast cancers.']"""

Material and methods:   To assess the use of chemotherapy in men with CRPC we conducted a register-based nationwide population-based study in Prostate Cancer data Base Sweden (PCBaSe) and a nationwide in-patient drug register (SALT database) between May 2009 and December 2010. We assumed that men who died of prostate cancer (PCa) underwent a period of CRPC before they died.  Results:   Among the 2677 men who died from PCa during the study inclusion period, 556 (21%) had received chemotherapy (intravenous or per oral) detectable within the observation period in SALT database. Specifically, 239 (61%) of men < 70 years had received chemotherapy, 246 (30%) of men between 70 and 79 years and 71 (5%) men older than 80 years. The majority of men 465/556 (84%) had received a docetaxel-containing regimen.

Treatment with chemotherapy was more common among men with little comorbidity and high educational level, as well as in men who had received curatively intended primary treatment.  Conclusion:   A majority of men younger than 70 years with CRPC were treated with chemotherapy in contrast to men between 70 and 79 years of whom half as many received chemotherapy. Chemotherapy treatment was often administered shortly prior to death. The low uptake of chemotherapy in older men with CRPC may be caused by concerns about tolerability of treatment, as well as treatment decisions based on chronological age rather than global health status.""","""['Ingela Franck Lissbrant', 'Hans Garmo', 'Anders Widmark', 'Pär Stattin']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Acta Oncol""","""['What is the appropriate use of palliative docetaxel in castration-resistant prostate cancer?', 'The Role of PCA 3 as a Prognostic Factor in Patients with Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC) Treated with Docetaxel.', 'Custirsen (OGX-011) combined with cabazitaxel and prednisone versus cabazitaxel and prednisone alone in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer previously treated with docetaxel (AFFINITY): a randomised, open-label, international, phase 3 trial.', 'Nationwide population-based study on the use of novel antiandrogens in men with prostate cancer in Sweden.', 'Subsequent Chemotherapy and Treatment Patterns After Abiraterone Acetate in Patients with Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer: Post Hoc Analysis of COU-AA-302.', 'Advances in the management of castration resistant prostate cancer.', 'Utilization Trends of Novel Hormonal Agents in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer in Quebec.', 'Modeling Disease Trajectories for Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer Using Nationwide Population-based Data.', 'Metronomic Chemotherapy for Advanced Prostate Cancer: A Literature Review.', 'Mortality in men with castration-resistant prostate cancer-A long-term follow-up of a population-based real-world cohort.', 'Effect of Chemotherapy on Overall Survival in Contemporary Metastatic Prostate Cancer Patients.']"""

Provenge (sipuleucel-T), a DC-based vaccine based on ex vivo-generated autologous DCs loaded with antigens, has recently received FDA approval for prostate cancer treatment, further validating the potential of DC-based vaccine modalities. However, direct antigen delivery to DCs in vivo via DC-specific surface receptors would enable a more direct and less laborious approach to immunization. In this study, the recombinant extracellular domains (ECD) of human and mouse DC-SIGN (hDC-SIGN and mDC-SIGN) were generated as DC-specific targets for mRNA display. Accordingly, an antibody-mimetic library was constructed by randomizing two exposed binding loops of an expression-enhanced 10th human fibronectin type III domain (e10Fn3). After three rounds of selection against mDC-SIGN, followed by four rounds of selection against hDC-SIGN, we were able to evolve several dual-specific ligands, which could bind to both soluble ECD of human and mouse DC-SIGNs. Using a cell-binding assay, one ligand, eFn-DC6, was found to have high affinity to hDC-SIGN and moderate affinity to mDC-SIGN. When fused with an antigenic peptide, eFn-DC6 could direct the antigen delivery and presentation by human peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC)-derived DCs and stimulate antigen-specific CD8(+) T cells to secrete inflammatory cytokines. Taken together, these results demonstrate the utility of mRNA display to select protein carriers for DC-based vaccination and offer in vitro evidence that the antibody-mimetic ligand eFn-DC6 represents a promising candidate for the development of an in vivo DC-based vaccine in humans.""","""['Liang Xiao', 'Kuo-Chan Hung', 'Terry T Takahashi', 'Kye-Il Joo', 'Matthew Lim', 'Richard W Roberts', 'Pin Wang']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""ACS Chem Biol""","""['Glycan-modified liposomes boost CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses by targeting DC-SIGN on dendritic cells.', 'In vivo targeting of human DC-SIGN drastically enhances CD8⁺ T-cell-mediated protective immunity.', 'In vivo targeting of antigens to human dendritic cells through DC-SIGN elicits stimulatory immune responses and inhibits tumor growth in grafted mouse models.', 'Glycan-based DC-SIGN targeting vaccines to enhance antigen cross-presentation.', 'The physiological role of DC-SIGN: a tale of mice and men.', 'Directing evolution of novel ligands by mRNA display.', 'Enabling Flow-Based Kinetic Off-Rate Selections Using a Microfluidic Enrichment Device.', 'Naïve Human Antibody Libraries for Infectious Diseases.', 'RasIns: Genetically Encoded Intrabodies of Activated Ras Proteins.', 'A potent immunotoxin targeting fibroblast activation protein for treatment of breast cancer in mice.']"""

Pressing ""recover fault"" button did not work and the right arm operated for few seconds more but the fault repeated again. We replaced the robotic instruments, shut down and restarted the system again that were all useless. Finally, all of the arms were out of order and we were not able to use the robot anymore.

Pigmentation traits influence sun exposure and therefore may affect prostate cancer risk. Because observational studies are vulnerable to confounding and measurement error, we used Mendelian randomization to examine the relationship of sun exposure with both prostate cancer risk and the intermediate phenotype, plasma levels of vitamin D.  Methods:   We created a tanning, a skin color, and a freckling score as combinations of single nucleotide polymorphisms that have been previously associated with these phenotypes. A higher score indicates propensity to burn, have a lighter skin color and freckles. The scores were tested for association with vitamin D levels (25-hydroxyvitamin-D and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin-D) and prostate-specific antigen detected prostate cancer in 3,123 White British individuals enrolled in the Prostate Testing for cancer and Treatment (ProtecT) study.  Results:   The freckling score was inversely associated with 25(OH)D levels [change in 25(OH)D per score unit -0.27; 95% CI, -0.52% to -0.01%], and the tanning score was positively associated with prostate cancer risk (OR = 1.05; 95% CI, 1.02-1.09), after adjustment for population stratification and potential confounders.  Conclusions:   Individuals who tend to burn are more likely to spend less time in the sun and consequently have lower plasma vitamin D levels and higher susceptibility to prostate cancer.

There is broad evidence that fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptors are important in prostate cancer initiation and progression, but the contribution of particular FGFs in this disease is not fully understood. The FGF family members FGF19, FGF21, and FGF23 comprise a distinct subfamily that circulate in serum and act in an endocrine manner. These endocrine FGFs require α-Klotho (KL) and/or β-Klotho (KLB), two related single-pass transmembrane proteins restricted in their tissue distribution, to act as coreceptors along with classic FGF receptors (FGFR) to mediate potent biologic activity. Here we show that FGF19 is expressed in primary and metastatic prostate cancer tissues, where it functions as an autocrine growth factor. Exogenous FGF19 promoted the growth, invasion, adhesion, and colony formation of prostate cancer cells at low ligand concentrations. FGF19 silencing in prostate cancer cells expressing autocrine FGF19 decreased invasion and proliferation in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. Consistent with these observations, KL and/or KLB were expressed in prostate cancer cells in vitro and in vivo, raising the possibility that additional endocrine FGFs may also exert biologic effects in prostate cancer.

Numbl overexpression relies on loss of the tumor suppressor miRNA-296-5p (miR-296), which actively represses translation of Numbl in normal cells. In turn, deregulated expression of Numbl mediates random tumor cell migration and invasion, blocking anoikis and promoting metastatic dissemination. In clinical specimens of non-small cell lung cancer, we found that Numbl overexpression correlated with a reduction in overall patient survival.

A rise in incidence has been observed in the course of recent decades, probably influenced by early detection, mainly in asymptomatic men, through regular screening with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing. The purpose of this study was to contribute to information on trends in prostate cancer incidence and mortality using population-based data.  Methods:   This was an exploratory ecological study of time trends, aiming at describing changes in prostate cancer incidence and mortality in Aracaju, Sergipe, Brazil, from 1996 to 2006. Rates were calculated from data of the Registro de Câncer de Base Populacional de Aracaju. Trends were calculated using the Joinpoint Regression Program.  Results:   For the study period, 1,490 incident cases and 334 deaths were included. Incident cases were more common after 50 years of age, and deaths after 55 years. Age-standardized incidence rates of 46.6 and 50.0/100,000 were observed in the early years of the series, and then progressively increased, with rates higher than 100.0/100,000 in later years. For mortality, age-standardized rates varied from 21.6 and 16.6/100,000 to 24.1 and 28.9/100,000 in later years. Joinpoint analysis identified one joinpoint for the incidence series, resulting in two trends, the first with annual percent change of 34% and the second with 5.8%; for the mortality series no joinpoint was identified, and the annual percent change was 2.1%.

MxA polymorphism (rs2071430) is located within an Interferon Stimulated Response Element (ISRE) at position -88 in the gene's promoter region, and it has been associated with increased susceptibility to infections and various diseases. In general, the low promoter activity genotype (GG) promotes susceptibility, whereas the high promoter activity genotype (TT) confers protection to Hepatitis C viral infection. MxA's role in prostate cancer is not fully understood. Previous literature has shown that MxA may be a mediator of the effect of IFN on normal and tumor cell motility. MxA may act as a tumor suppressor and the level of expression may be a predictor of metastatic potential. Based on this information, in this study we investigated the association of this functional polymorphism (rs2071430) in MxA with prostate cancer.  Methods:   Sample size and power was calculated using the PGA software. Genomic DNA from a controls (n=140) and prostate cancer patients (n=164) were used for genotyping SNP rs2071430 on all samples. Statistical analysis was performed using logistic regression model.  Results:   A significant association was observed between rs2071430 genotype GG and prostate cancer. Individuals harboring the GG genotype are at an increased risk of prostate cancer. Data stratification reveals that the mutant GT genotype offers either offers some protection against prostate cancer in Caucasians.  Conclusions:   MxA SNP rs2071430 GG genotype is significantly associated with prostate cancer irrespective of race. However, data stratification also suggests that the GT genotype is under-represented in Caucasian subjects suggesting its role in protection against prostate cancer in Caucasians. Although MxA is primarily implicated in viral infection, but it may be also be associated with prostate cancer.

By using 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU), a label-retaining cell population was characterized in PDGs. Cerulein administration led to more BrdU(+) cells in PDGs of obese mice compared with lean mice. The observed increase was specific to PDGs, because BrdU incorporation in cells of the pancreatic duct was not increased. In addition, the expression of distinct tumor markers in PDGs was characterized by Muc5ac, S100P, regenerating islet-derived 3β, 14-3-3 σ, and prostate stem cell antigen immunochemistry. Type 2 diabetes-like syndrome, accompanied by chronic pancreatitis, enhanced nuclear localization of S100P. Both risk factors for pancreatic cancer also induced the production of Muc5ac and the nuclear localization of S100P [corrected].

Alpha (α)-tomatine is the major saponin present in tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) and we have previously reported that it suppresses tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α)-induced nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) in androgen-independent prostate cancer PC-3 cells and also potently induces apoptosis of these cells. However, the precise mechanism by which α-tomatine suppresses NF-κB nuclear translocation is yet to be elucidated and the anti-tumor activity of this agent in vivo has not been examined.  Methodology/principal findings:   In the present study we show that suppression of NF-κB activation by α-tomatine occurs through inhibition of I kappa B alpha (IκBα) kinase activity, leading to sequential suppression of IκBα phosphorylation, IκBα degradation, NF-κB/p65 phosphorylation, and NF-κB p50/p65 nuclear translocation. Consistent with its ability to induce apoptosis, α-tomatine reduced TNF-α induced activation of the pro-survival mediator Akt and its inhibition of NF-κB activation was accompanied by significant reduction in the expression of NF-κB-dependent anti-apoptotic (c-IAP1, c-IAP2, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, XIAP and survivin) proteins. We also evaluated the antitumor activity of α-tomatine against PC-3 cell tumors grown subcutaneously and orthotopically in mice. Our data indicate that intraperitoneal administration of α-tomatine significantly attenuates the growth of PC-3 cell tumors grown at both sites. Analysis of tumor material indicates that the tumor suppressing effects of α-tomatine were accompanied by increased apoptosis and lower proliferation of tumor cells as well as reduced nuclear translocation of the p50 and p65 components of NF-κB.

However, its mechanism of action in proliferation remains unknown. An understanding of the mechanism of AR action in proliferation may lead to the development of effective strategies for the treatment of prostate cancer.  Methodology/principal findings:   In this study we report that pulse treatment of synchronized LNCaP cells with Casodex, an AR-antagonist, for 4 hours in mid-G(1) phase was sufficient to prevent cells from entering S phase. Since the assembly of pre-replication complex (pre-RC) in G(1) is required for the progression of cells from G(1) to S phase, the effect of Casodex during mid-G(1) suggested that the role of AR in proliferation might be to regulate the assembly of pre-RC. To test this possibility, we investigated the interaction between AR and Cdc6, an essential component of pre-RC in LNCaP cells. AR co-localized and co-immunoprecipitated with Cdc6, and Casodex treatment disrupted this interaction.

Anti-androgens that block the activity of the AR therefore remain a valid therapeutic option. However, they must be more effective than, or display a distinct mechanism of action or binding mode from those of bicalutamide and hydroxyflutamide, which are currently in clinical use. For that reason, the second-generation anti-androgen MDV3100 was developed. MDV3100, however, shares its 4-cyano-3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl group with bicalutamide and hydroxyflutamide required for binding to the AR. In this work, we used a combined strategy to find new antagonist structures distinct from the 4-cyano-3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl group to avoid cross-resistance for these compounds and to find structures without agonist activity on mutant ARs (AR W741C and AR T877A). We found two novel chemotypes with AR-antagonistic activity (IC(50): 3-6 μM) by virtual screening and confirmed their biological activity in an androgen-responsive reporter assay. The design of our computational approach was validated by the observation of strongly decreased or absence of agonistic activity on the two mutant ARs.

Methods:   The authors reviewed patient-reported outcomes data collected prospectively using validated instruments that assessed bowel and urinary quality of life (QOL) for patients with localized prostate cancer who received 3DCRT (n = 123), IMRT (n = 153) or PBT (n = 95). Clinically meaningful differences in mean QOL scores were defined as those exceeding half the standard deviation of the baseline mean value. Changes from baseline were compared within groups at the first post-treatment follow-up (2-3 months from the start of treatment) and at 12 months and 24 months.  Results:   At the first post-treatment follow-up, patients who received 3DCRT and IMRT, but not those who received PBT, reported a clinically meaningful decrement in bowel QOL. At 12 months and 24 months, all 3 cohorts reported clinically meaningful decrements in bowel QOL. Patients who received IMRT reported clinically meaningful decrements in the domains of urinary irritation/obstruction and incontinence at the first post-treatment follow-up. At 12 months, patients who received PBT, but not those who received IMRT or 3DCRT, reported a clinically meaningful decrement in the urinary irritation/obstruction domain. At 24 months, none of the 3 cohorts reported clinically meaningful changes in urinary QOL.  Conclusions:   Patients who received 3DCRT, IMRT, or PBT reported distinct patterns of treatment-related QOL.

Methods:   A nonrandomized safety cohort consisting of 14 patients was followed by a double-blind randomized Phase II trial. Patients received standard doses of docetaxel (75 mg/m(2)) with prednisone 10 mg daily with or without 500 mg/day of enzastaurin.  Results:   There was no difference in the objective response rate between the enzastaurin and placebo arms (placebo: 7 [15.2 %]; enzastaurin: 6 [15.0 %]; P = 1.00). The median PFS was 229 days for patients in the enzastaurin arm versus 213 days for the placebo arm (P = 0.524). The 1-year overall survival rates were almost identical, with 76.7 % and 75.1 % in the enzastaurin and placebo arms, respectively. Therapy was well tolerated although the combination of enzastaurin and docetaxel was more myelosuppressive than with docetaxel alone.  Conclusions:   The clinical activity of docetaxel/prednisone plus enzastaurin cannot be distinguished from docetaxel/prednisone alone, given the limitations of a randomized Phase II design.

Here we report that E74-like factor 3 (ELF3), a member of the ETS family of transcription factors, is a repressor of AR transcriptional activity. Exogenous expression of ELF3 represses AR transcriptional activity when assessed using reporter-based transfection assays or when evaluated on endogenous AR target genes. Conversely, ELF3 knock down increases the AR transcriptional activity. Biochemical dissection of this activity indicates that it results from the physical interaction between ELF3 and AR and that this interaction inhibits the recruitment of AR to specific androgen response elements within target gene promoters. Significantly, we observed that depletion of ELF3 expression in LNCaP cells promotes cell migration, whereas increased ELF3 expression severely inhibits tumor growth in vitro and in a mouse xenograft model.

IGFBP-2 mainly modulates IGF actions in the pericellular space; however, there is considerable evidence to suggest that IGFBP-2 may also act independently of the IGFs. These IGF-independent actions of IGFBP-2 are exerted either via interactions at the cell surface or intracellularly, via interaction with cytoplasmic or nuclear-binding partners. The precise mechanism underlying the intracellular/intranuclear localization of IGFBP-2 remains unclear. In this study, we investigated IGFBP-2 nuclear localization in several common cancer cells with the aim of dissecting the mechanism of its nuclear trafficking. IGFBP-2 is detected in the nuclei of common cancer cells, including breast, prostate and several neuroblastoma cell lines, using cell fractionation and confocal microscopy. Via nuclear import assays, we show that nuclear entry of IGFBP-2 is mediated by the classical nuclear import mechanisms, primarily through importin-α, as demonstrated by the use of blocking, competition and co-immunoprecipitation assays. Bioinformatics analysis of the IGFBP-2 protein sequence with PSORT II identified a classical nuclear localization signal (cNLS) sequence at 179PKKLRPP185, within the IGFBP-2 linker domain, mutagenesis of which abolishes IGFBP-2 nuclear import. Accordingly, the NLSmutIGFBP-2 fails to activate the VEGF promoter, which would otherwise occur in the presence of wild-type IGFBP-2. As a consequence, no activation of angiogenic processes were observed in NLSmutIGFBP-2 expressing SHEP cells when implanted onto our in vivo quail chorio-allantoic membrane model. Taken together, these data show for the first time that IGFBP-2 possesses a functional NLS sequence and that IGFBP-2 actively translocates into the nucleus by a classical nuclear import mechanism, involving formation of IGFBP-2 complexes with importin-α.

Importantly, knockdown of KDM4B in multiple cell lines results in almost complete depletion of AR protein levels.

Recent studies indicate that drug resistance can be rapidly induced by some soluble factors, such as cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and cell adhesion factors in the tumor microenvironment. Osteopontin (OPN), an extracellular matrix protein, has a functional arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) domain for binding to integrin. Here we found OPN expression to be upregulated by hypoxic condition in PC-3 prostate tumor cells. OPN increased the mRNA and protein expression of p-glycoprotein (P-gp), a subfamily of ATP-binding cassette transporter in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. The increase in P-gp transporter by OPN was mediated by binding to αvβ3 integrin. Daunomycin (DUN), a chemotherapeutic agent with autofluorescence, was used to evaluate the pump activity, and OPN increased the drug pumping-out activity. OPN inhibited DUN-induced cell death, which was antagonized by αvβ3 monoclonal antibody. Long-term treatment with DUN further enhanced the expression of OPN. Knockdown of endogenous OPN potentiated the DUN-induced apoptosis of PC-3 cells. Furthermore, knockdown of OPN enhanced cell death caused by other drugs, including paclitaxel, doxorubicin, actinomycin-D, and rapamycin, which are also P-gp substrates. The animal studies also showed that OPN knockdown enhanced the cytotoxic action of DUN.

The molecular basis of cooperation between these genetic alterations is unknown. Here, we show that SPRY2 deficiency alone triggers activation of AKT and ERK, but this is insufficient to drive tumorigenesis. In addition to AKT and ERK activation, SPRY2 loss also activates a PP2A-dependent tumor suppressor checkpoint. Mechanistically, the PP2A-mediated growth arrest depends on GSK3β and is ultimately mediated by nuclear PTEN. In murine prostate cancer models, Pten haploinsufficiency synergized with Spry2 deficiency to drive tumorigenesis, including metastasis. Together, these results show that loss of Pten cooperates with Spry2 deficiency by bypassing a novel tumor suppressor checkpoint. Furthermore, loss of SPRY2 expression correlates strongly with loss of PTEN and/or PP2A subunits in human prostate cancer. This underlines the cooperation between SPRY2 deficiency and PTEN or PP2A inactivation in promoting tumorigenesis.

Furthermore, we examined the effects of incorporating SM status, Gleason score (Gls), and preoperative PSA level into the discrimination accuracy of the current tumor node metastasis-staging system.  Materials and methods:   We analyzed 863 PCa patients treated with radical prostatectomy from 1999 to 2008. Only individuals with pT2N0 or pT3N0, without neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy, were included. We performed chi-square automatic interaction detection analysis to generate a classification model for predicting BCR by analyzing interactions between age at surgery, SM status, Gls, PSA, and tumor stage, tumor volume and relative tumor volume. Cox regression analyses tested the relationship between SM status and BCR rate after stratification according to T-stage and the novel classification. The predictive and discrimination accuracy of the current T-stage and of the classification model was quantified with time-dependent receiver operating characteristics and integrated discrimination improvement. The topographical association between extracapsular extension of PCa and positive SM was analyzed in patients with pT3aR1 using a computational reconstruction diagram of the prostate.  Results:   The chi-square automatic interaction detection analysis found interactions among pT Stage, SM status, PSA and Gls and generated a classification model for BCR prediction: pT2R0, pT2R1, pT3a PSA ≤ 10 ng/ml, pT3a PSA>10 ng/ml and pT3b. Men with pT2R1 had a shorter time to BCR compared with men with pT3a-PSA ≤ 10 ng/ml (P<0.0001). Gls≥7a was correlated with a poorer BCR rate than Gls≤7a in men with pT2R1 or pT3a PSA ≤ 10 ng/ml (P = 0.012). The rank order (highest to lowest) for the risk of developing BCR was pT3b>pT2R1/pT3a-PSA>10 ng/ml>pT2R1/pT3a PSA ≤ 10 ng/ml>pT2R0 (P<0.0001). Discrimination accuracy gains were observed when PCa was stratified according to the novel classification (P<0.0001). A topographical association between extracapsular extension and positive SM was found in patients with pT3aR1 (P = 0.01).

Early stage androgen dependent prostate carcinoma responds well to conventional therapies, but relatively few treatment options exist for patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer. One of the most suitable targets for antibody-mediated approaches is prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) which is a well known tumour associated antigen. PSMA is a type II integral cell-surface membrane protein that is not secreted, and its expression density and enzymatic activity are increased progressively in prostate cancer compared to normal prostate epithelium, thereby making PSMA an ideal target for monoclonal antibody imaging and therapy. To obtain a small protein that can better penetrate tissue, we have engineered a single-chain variable fragment (scFv) starting from the variable heavy and light domains of the murine anti-PSMA monoclonal antibody D2B. scFvD2B was analysed in vitro for activity, stability, internalisation ability and in vivo for targeting specificity. Maintenance of function and immunoreactivity as well as extremely high radiolabelling efficiency and radiochemical purity were demonstrated by in vitro assays and under different experimental conditions. Despite its monovalent binding, scFvD2B retained a good strength of binding and was able to internalise around 40% of bound antigen.

Results and limitations:   Of 31,571 prostate cancer patients, 9204 (29%) received medical endocrine therapy and 2060 (7%) were orchidectomized.

Methods and materials:   Seven MRI marker agents were analyzed: saline solution, Conray-60, copper sulfate (CuSO4) (1.5 g/L), liquid vitamin E, fish oil, 1% agarose gel (1 g agarose powder per 100 mL distilled water), and a cobalt-chloride complex contrast (C4) (CoCl2/glycine = 4:1). A plastic, ring-shaped marker-flange was designed and tested on both titanium and plastic applicators. Three separate phantoms were designed to test the marker-flange, interstitial catheters for prostate BT, and intracavitary catheters for gynecologic HDR BT. T1- and T2-weighted MRI were analyzed for all markers in each phantom and quantified as percentages compared with a 3% agarose gel background. The geometric accuracy of the MR signal for the marker-flange was measured using an MRI-CT fusion.  Results:   The CuSO4 and C4 markers on T1-weighted MRI and saline on T2-weighted MRI showed the highest signals. The marker-flange showed hyper-signals of >500% with CuSO4 and C4 on T1-weighted MRI and of >400% with saline on T2-weighted MRI on titanium applicators. On T1-weighted MRI, the MRI signal inaccuracies of marker-flanges were measured <2 mm, regardless of marker agents, and that of CuSO4 was 0.42 ± 0.14 mm.  Conclusion:   The use of interstitial/intracavitary markers for MRI-guided prostate/gynecologic BT was observed to be feasible, providing accurate source pathway reconstruction.

Furthermore, applying the image enhancement term to CBCT imagery leads to an intensity corrected CBCT with better image quality. To achieve minimal processing time, the algorithm is implemented on a graphic processing unit (GPU) platform.

Clinical experience has shown us some men after pelvic radiation therapy (RT) also experience anejaculation. This analysis was conducted to define the ejaculation profiles of men after RT for prostate cancer (PCa).  Methods:   As a routine part of the sexual health evaluation for post-RT patients, men provided information regarding their ejaculatory function and orgasm. Analysis was conducted of a sexual medicine database reviewing demographic data, PCa factors, erectile, ejaculatory, and orgasmic function. Men with prior history of RP, cryotherapy, focal therapies, and androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) were excluded. Patients completed the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) questionnaire at follow-up visits commencing with the first posttreatment visit and specific attention was paid to the IIEF orgasm domain.  Results:   Three hundred and sixty-four consecutive patients were included. Two hundred and fifty-two patients had external beam, and 112 patients had brachytherapy (BT). Mean age was 64 ± 11 (42-78) years and mean follow-up after RT was 6 ± 4.5 years. Mean prostate size at time of RT was 42 ± 21 g. Of the entire population, 72% lost the ability to ejaculate in an antegrade fashion after prostate RT by their last visit. The proportion experiencing anejaculation at 1, 3, and 5 years after RT was 16%, 69%, and 89%, respectively. For men with at least two IIEF questionnaires completed, the orgasm domain scores decreased dramatically over the follow-up period; orgasm domain scores (0-10): <12 months post-RT 7.4, 13-24 months 5.4, 25-36 months 3.2, >36 months 2.8 (P < 0.01). Multivariable analysis identified several factors predictive of failure to ejaculate: older age, ADT, RT dose > 100 Gy, and smaller prostates at the time of RT.  Conclusions:   The vast majority of men after prostate RT will experience anejaculation and should be counseled accordingly prior to undergoing therapy.

So there is some concern about delayed diagnosis of prostate cancer in obese men. In the present study, we found that the accuracy level of PSA for detecting prostate cancer was not significantly different between different obesity levels. A well-designed study adjusting for several factors, e.g. diet, exercise, medication and comorbidity, which may possibly compensate for the associated effects on PSA levels, is needed for confirmation of the present findings.  Objective:   To investigate prostate-specific antigen (PSA) accuracy in detecting prostate cancer according to body mass index (BMI) in Asian men with a PSA level of <30 ng/mL using contemporary multicore (≥ 12) prostate biopsy.  Patients and methods:   We reviewed the records of 3471 patients, whose initial PSA levels were <30 ng/mL, who underwent multicore (≥ 12) transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy between January 2004 and May 2011. BMI was categorised as performed previously for the Asian population: <23, 23-24.9, 25-29.9, and ≥ 30 kg/m(2) . PSA accuracy for detecting prostate cancer in each BMI group was assessed based on the receiver operating characteristics-derived area under the curve.  Results:   The mean age and median PSA level were inversely associated with BMI; the median PSA level in each BMI category was 7.84, 7.75, 7.33 and 5.79 ng/mL, respectively (P < 0.001). In all, prostate cancer was detected from biopsy in 1102 (31.7%) patients. The PSA accuracy for predicting prostate cancer in all patients was estimated to be 0.607, and PSA accuracies in each BMI category were 0.638, 0.572, 0.613 and 0.544, respectively; there was no significant difference among the groups in terms of PSA accuracy.  Conclusions:   The accuracy of PSA in predicting prostate cancer did not change regardless of BMI category in Asian men. However, as patients with higher BMIs had lower PSA levels than those with lower BMIs, it can therefore be suggested that the PSA threshold should be lower in obese men to discriminate between prostate cancer and benign conditions in the real clinical situation.""","""['Jong J Oh', 'Seong J Jeong', 'Byung K Lee', 'Chang W Jeong', 'Seok-Soo Byun', 'Sung K Hong', 'Sang E Lee']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['The interplay between obesity and the accuracy of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) for predicting prostate cancer.', 'Value of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) mass ratio in the detection of prostate cancer in men with PSA levels of ≤10 ng/mL.', 'The effect of obesity and lower serum prostate-specific antigen levels on prostate-cancer screening results in American men.', 'Impact of obesity on the predictive accuracy of prostate-specific antigen density and prostate-specific antigen in native Korean men undergoing prostate biopsy.', 'Prostate needle biopsy: what we do and what should be improved.', ""Body composition and serum prostate-specific antigen: review and findings from Flint Men's Health Study."", 'Association between obesity and frequency of high-grade prostate cancer on biopsy in men: A single-center retrospective study.', 'Assessment of factors associated with PSA level in prostate cancer cases and controls from three geographical regions.', 'A Comprehensive Genome-Wide and Phenome-Wide Examination of BMI and Obesity in a Northern Nevadan Cohort.', 'Improving the detection rate of prostate cancer in the gray zone of PI-RADS v2 and serum tPSA by using prostate-specific antigen-age volume.', 'Age-Specific Reference Ranges of Prostate-Specific Antigen among Saudi Men as a Representation of the Arab Population.']"""

In this study, we examined if the antitumor activity of ABZ could be enhanced by its combination with other microtubule-binding agents.  Methods:   The interactions between ABZ and microtubule-binding agents, paclitaxel, vinblastine, colchicine, and 2-methoxyestradiol were characterized using median effect analysis method in HCT-116 colorectal cancer cells and DU145 prostate cancer cell line. The mechanism underlying the synergistic interaction related to tubulin polymerization and apoptosis was then investigated. Finally, the effect of the combination therapy on the survival of HCT-116 tumor-bearing nude mice was evaluated.  Results:   Among the tested drugs, a synergistic anti-proliferative effect was observed with the combination of low concentrations of ABZ plus colchicine and ABZ plus 2-methoxyestradiol (2ME). Exploring the mechanism of the interaction between ABZ and 2ME revealed that the combination therapy synergistically activated the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis. Consistent with in vitro results, the combination of low concentration of ABZ with 2ME prolonged the survival of mice-bearing HCT-116 tumors. High concentration of ABZ in combination with 2ME, however, proved to be less effective than ABZ alone.  Conclusions:   The combination of low doses of ABZ and 2ME has shown promising results in our pre-clinical model. Additionally, the finding that the combination of two microtubule-binding agents that share the same binding site can act synergistically may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies in cancer treatment.""","""['Anahid Ehteda', 'Peter Galettis', 'Krishna Pillai', 'David L Morris']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Complexation of albendazole with hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin significantly improves its pharmacokinetic profile, cell cytotoxicity and antitumor efficacy in nude mice.', 'Antitumor activity of albendazole against the human colorectal cancer cell line HT-29: in vitro and in a xenograft model of peritoneal carcinomatosis.', '18F-FDG PET imaging for monitoring the early anti-tumor effect of albendazole on triple-negative breast cancer.', '2-Methoxyestradiol, a promising anticancer agent.', '2-methoxyestradiol and disorders of female reproductive tissues.', 'The potential anti-cancer effects of quercetin on blood, prostate and lung cancers: An update.', 'Repurposing of Benzimidazole Anthelmintic Drugs as Cancer Therapeutics.', 'In silico to In vivo development of a polyherbal against Haemonchus contortus.', 'Combination of quercetin and 2-methoxyestradiol inhibits epithelial-mesenchymal transition in PC-3 cell line via Wnt signaling pathway.', 'Albendazole and Mebendazole as Anti-Parasitic and Anti-Cancer Agents: an Update.']"""

Prostate epithelial cells cultured in Matrigel form three-dimensional acini that mimic aspects of prostate gland development. The organization of these structures requires the tumor suppressor Dickkopf-3 (Dkk-3), a divergent member of the Dkk family of secreted Wnt signalling antagonists that is frequently downregulated in prostate cancer. To gain further insight into the function of Dkk-3 in the prostate, we compared the prostates of Dkk3-null mice with those of control littermates. We found increased proliferation of prostate epithelial cells in the mutant mice and changes in prostate tissue organization. Consistent with these observations, cell proliferation was elevated in acini formed by human prostate epithelial cells stably silenced for Dkk-3. Silencing of Dkk-3 increased TGF-β/Smad signalling, and inhibitors of TGF-β/Smad signalling rescued the defective acinar phenotype caused by loss of Dkk-3. These findings suggest that Dkk-3 maintains the structural integrity of the prostate gland by limiting TGF-β/Smad signalling.""","""['Diana Romero', 'Yoshiaki Kawano', 'Nora Bengoa', 'Marjorie M Walker', 'Nicole Maltry', 'Christof Niehrs', 'Jonathan Waxman', 'Robert Kypta']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Cell Sci""","""['Dickkopf-3 function in the prostate: implications for epithelial homeostasis and tumor progression.', 'Dickkopf-3 regulates prostate epithelial cell acinar morphogenesis and prostate cancer cell invasion by limiting TGF-β-dependent activation of matrix metalloproteases.', 'Dickkopf-3 function in the prostate: implications for epithelial homeostasis and tumor progression.', 'Regulation of prostate cell growth and morphogenesis by Dickkopf-3.', 'microRNA and non-canonical TGF-β signalling: implications for prostate cancer therapy.', 'TGF-beta/Smad in prostate cancer: an update.', 'Dickkopf-3: An Update on a Potential Regulator of the Tumor Microenvironment.', 'CRISPR activation screen identifies TGFβ-associated PEG10 as a crucial tumor suppressor in Ewing sarcoma.', 'Exploring the Wnt Pathway as a Therapeutic Target for Prostate Cancer.', 'Functional Genomic Screening During Somatic Cell Reprogramming Identifies DKK3 as a Roadblock of Organ Regeneration.', 'BZW1 promotes cell proliferation in prostate cancer by regulating TGF-β1/Smad pathway.']"""

In this study, we investigated if pre-treatment androgen content in prostate biopsy specimens could predict their response to primary androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and future castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). One-hundred and sixty-five prostate cancer patients who received primary ADT were enrolled. They had received multiple core prostate needle biopsy at diagnosis, and an additional one needle biopsy specimen was obtained for tissue androgen determination using LC-MS/MS. The patients' prostate specific antigen (PSA) values were periodically followed during the treatment and patients were determined to have CRPC when their PSA value increased continuously to 25% above the nadir and a 2.0 ng/mL increase. A significant correlation was found between PSA value decline velocity (PSA half-time) after ADT and pre-ADT tissue androgen content. Twenty-three patients were determined to have CRPC. These CRPC patients had a significantly high concentration of tissue T (p < 0.01) and low concentration of tissue 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) (p < 0.01), resulting in a higher tissue T/DHT ratio (p < 0.001). A multivariate Cox proportional hazard model revealed the pre-ADT tissue T/DHT ratio and Gleason score as independent predictors for CRPC development. By using the two statistically significant variables, the relative risk of CRPC development could be calculated. The results of this study suggest that the evaluation of prostate androgen content in a single needle biopsy specimen may be useful to predict future CRPC development after primary ADT.

We aimed to evaluate the prognostic significance of histopathological patterns of DAC. A series of 1,051 radical prostatectomy specimens from Karolinska University Hospital 1998-2005 was reviewed. A ductal component was classified as classical DAC (DACC) if it had columnar, pseudostratified epithelium, elongated nuclei, and papillary, glandular, or cribriform architecture; borderline DAC (DACB) if it lacked elongated nuclei or classical architecture; and prostatic adenocarcinoma with ductal features (PCDF) if stratified high-grade nuclei were found. DACC, DACB, and PCDF were seen in 2.6, 4.0, and 1.6 % of the cases. DAC was usually mixed with PAC and constituted 10-100 % (mean 40 %) of the main tumor. Location was periurethral, peripheral, or both in 69.8, 3.5, and 26.7 %. Necrosis was seen in 31.3 %, stromal invasion of DAC in 52.3 %, and intraductal spread in 91.9 %. In DACC/DACB and PAC, extraprostatic extension was seen in 66.7 and 42.4 % (p < 0.001) and seminal vesicle invasion in 13.0 and 5.0 % (p = 0.0045). DACC, DACB, and PCDF had a hazard ratio for biochemical recurrence of 1.5 (0.7-2.8), 1.4 (0.8-2.6) and 1.2 (0.5-2.7). When PCDF was excluded from DAC, hazard ratio was 1.4 (95 % CI 0.9-2.3, p = 0.12). Location, % DAC, necrosis, stromal invasion, or Gleason score were not predictive of recurrence.

Characterization of T1 and the structurally related semisynthetic analogues (T2 and T3) revealed that these diterpenoids have antiandrogen properties that include inhibition of both androgen-dependent proliferation and androgen receptor transcriptional activity by a mechanism that involved competing with androgen for androgen receptor LBD and blocking essential N/C interactions required for androgen-induced androgen receptor transcriptional activity. Structure-activity relationship analyses revealed some chemical features of T1 that are associated with activity and yielded T3 as the most potent analogue. In vivo, T3 significantly reduced the weight of seminal vesicles, which are an androgen-dependent tissue, thereby confirming the on-target activity of T3.

Methods:   The present prospective study included 44 prostate cancer patients with implanted fiducials treated with three-dimensional (3D) conformal radiotherapy. Daily localization was based on skin marks followed by marker detection using kilovoltage (kV) imaging and subsequent patient repositioning. Additionally, in-treatment megavoltage (MV) images were obtained for each treatment field. In an off-line analysis of 7,273 images, interfraction prostate motion, RSE after marker-based prostate localization, prostate position during each treatment session, and the effect of treatment time on intrafraction deviations were analyzed to evaluate PTV margins.  Results:   Margins accounting for interfraction deviation, RSE and intrafraction motion were 14.1, 12.9, and 15.1 mm in anterior-posterior (AP), superior-inferior (SI), and left-right (LR) direction for skin mark alignment and 9.6, 8.7, and 2.6 mm for bony structure alignment, respectively. Alignment to implanted markers required margins of 4.6, 2.8, and 2.5 mm. As margins to account for intrafraction motion increased with treatment prolongation PTV margins could be reduced to 3.9, 2.6, and 2.4 mm if treatment time was ≤ 4 min.  Conclusion:   With daily online correction and repositioning based on implanted fiducials, a significant reduction of PTV margins can be achieved.

The percentage of unknown staged cancer cases varies considerably across state cancer registries; factors contributing to the variations in unknown stage have not been reported in the literature before. The purpose of this study was to examine whether these variations were influenced by demographic and/or clinical factors as well as the type of reporting facility.  Methods:   Invasive colorectal, lung, female breast, and prostate cancers diagnosed between 2004 and 2007 were obtained from the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries (NAACCR); 47 population-based cancer registries in the United States were included. The unknown stage was based on Summary Stage 2000 codes derived from Collaborative Stage Version 1 (CSv1). Relative importance analysis was used to identify variables that were essential in predicting unknown stage. Using state central registries as analytical units, multiple linear regression was used to evaluate factors associated with the percentage of unknown stage by cancer site; potential outlier registries with a high percentage of unknown stage cases were identified using boxplots and standardized residuals.  Results:   Overall, lung cancer had the highest percentage of unknown stage (8.3%) and prostate cancer had the largest variation of unknown stage among registries (0.6%-18.1%). The percentages of neoplasms not otherwise specified (NOS) histology, non-microscopic confirmation, and non-hospital reporting source were positively associated (p less than 0.05) with percentage of unknown stage for all studied cancer sites before adjustment. Variables that retained a positive association with unknown stage including all demographic and clinical variables, year of diagnosis, and type of reporting source were black race, metropolitan area less than 1 million population, histologies of neoplasms NOS or epithelial neoplasms NOS, diagnosis year 2005, and non-hospital reporting source for colorectal cancer; metropolitan area less than 1 million population, neoplasms NOS histology, and non-hospital reporting source for female breast; and diagnosis year 2005 and non-hospital reporting source for prostate. After adjustment, none of the predictors were significant for lung cancer. We observed 1 potential outlier registry each for colorectal, lung and female breast cancers.  Conclusions:   Factors associated with unknown stage differ by cancer site; however, the type of reporting source is an important predictor of unknown stage for all cancers except lung after adjustment. Central registries with high percentage of unknown stage should be made aware of their data quality issue(s). As a result, these registries can investigate those factors and provide training to registrars to improve their cancer data quality.""","""['Mei-Chin Hsieh', 'Qingzhao Yu', 'Xiao-Cheng Wu', 'Brad Wohler', 'Ying Fan', 'Baozhen Qiao', 'Ahmedin Jemal', 'Umed A Ajani']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""J Registry Manag""","""['Impact of socioeconomic status on cancer incidence and stage at diagnosis: selected findings from the surveillance, epidemiology, and end results: National Longitudinal Mortality Study.', 'Annual Report to the Nation on the status of cancer, 1975-2010, featuring prevalence of comorbidity and impact on survival among persons with lung, colorectal, breast, or prostate cancer.', 'Frequency and determinants of missing data in clinical and prognostic variables recently added to SEER.', 'Annual report to the nation on the status of cancer, 1975-2000, featuring the uses of surveillance data for cancer prevention and control.', 'Cancer trends in the United States--a view from Europe.', 'Gastric adenocarcinoma burden and late-stage diagnosis in Latino and non-Latino populations in the United States and Texas, during 2004-2016: A multilevel analysis.', 'Rural-Urban and Racial/Ethnic Disparities in Invasive Cervical Cancer Incidence in the United States, 2010-2014.', 'Cancer Registration Manual Understanding by Medical Record Administrators.']"""

SPG significantly induced apoptotic cell death, resulting in an increase in the sub-G1 apoptotic cell population, apoptotic DNA fragmentation and morphological changes. Pre-treatment with a caspase inhibitor modestly attenuated the SPG-induced increase in the sub-G1 cell population, suggesting that caspases play a role in SPG-induced apoptosis. Moreover, SPG-induced apoptosis was associated with changes in caspase activity, the upregulation of the apoptotic protein, Bax and the downregulation of the anti-apoptotic protein, Bcl-2.

This study is aimed at investigating the association between pre-existing hypertension, hyperglycemia, and overweight and the overall survival (OS) of PCa patients receiving androgen deprivation therapy (ADT).  Methods:   We studied the clinical data of 323 patients of PCa receiving ADT in our hospital from January 2003 to August 2012 aged 50-91. The association between OS and hypertension, hyperglycemia, or overweight, both separately and together, was analyzed via Kaplan-Meier method. The distributions of clinicopathological features among groups were evaluated using Fisher's exact or chi-square test.  Results:   23 men (7.12 %) were lost to follow-up during this study. During a median follow-up for 43 months (range 3-119 months), 122 deaths (40.67 %) were confirmed. The five-year OS rate of men with both hypertension and overweight (28.57 %) was significantly lower than that of control group (48.33 %, P = 0.024). It was also moderately lower than that of men just with hypertension (50.00 %, P = 0.095) or overweight (55.56 %, P = 0.088). Men with both hyperglycemia and overweight had significantly shorter survival time than control group (P = 0.037). The distributions of clinical information were similar among all the groups except that overweight patients had a lower proportion of PSA level over 20 ng/mL (65.38 %) than control group (84.95 %, P = 0.026).  Conclusions:   Pre-existing hypertension, hyperglycemia, and overweight were associated with poor prognosis of PCa patients.

One common treatment is androgen-deprivation therapy, which reduces symptoms in most patients. However, over time, patients develop tumors that are androgen-independent and ultimately fatal. The mechanisms that cause this transition remain largely unknown, and as a result, there are no effective treatments against androgen-independent prostate cancer. As a model platform, we used the LNCaP cell line and its androgen-independent derivative, LNCaP-SF. Utilizing stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture coupled to mass spectrometry, we assessed the differential global protein expression of the two cell lines. Our proteomic analysis resulted in the quantification of 3355 proteins. Bioinformatic prioritization resulted in 42 up-regulated and 46 down-regulated proteins in LNCaP-SF cells relative to LNCaP cells. Our top candidate, HMGCS2, an enzyme involved in ketogenesis, was found to be 9-fold elevated in LNCaP-SF cells, based on peptide ratios. After analyzing the remaining enzymes of this pathway (ACAT1, BDH1, HMGCL, and OXCT1), we observed increased expression of these proteins in the LNCaP-SF cells, which was further verified using Western blotting. To determine whether these enzymes were up-regulated in clinical samples, we performed quantitative PCR and immunohistochemistry on human prostate cancer tissues, from which we observed significantly increased transcript and protein levels in high-grade cancer (Gleason grade ≥ 8). In addition, we observed significant elevation of these enzymes in the LuCaP 96AI castration-resistant xenograft. Further assessment of ACAT1 on human castration-resistant metastatic prostate cancer tissues revealed substantially elevated expression of ACAT1 in these specimens. Taken together, our results indicate that enzymes of the ketogenic pathway are up-regulated in high-grade prostate cancer and could serve as potential tissue biomarkers for the diagnosis or prognosis of high-grade disease.""","""['Punit Saraon', 'Daniela Cretu', 'Natasha Musrap', 'George S Karagiannis', 'Ihor Batruch', 'Andrei P Drabovich', 'Theodorus van der Kwast', 'Atsushi Mizokami', 'Colm Morrissey', 'Keith Jarvi', 'Eleftherios P Diamandis']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Mol Cell Proteomics""","""['Proteomic profiling of androgen-independent prostate cancer cell lines reveals a role for protein S during the development of high grade and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Proteomic comparison of prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP-FGC and LNCaP-r reveals heatshock protein 60 as a marker for prostate malignancy.', 'Upregulation of FAM84B during prostate cancer progression.', 'Androgen receptors in early and castration resistant prostate cancer: friend or foe?', 'The Value of Phenotypic Precision Medicine in Prostate Cancer.', 'The role of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors in the tumor microenvironment, tumor cell metabolism, and anticancer therapy.', 'Germ Cell-Specific Proteins AKAP4 and ASPX Facilitate Identification of Rare Spermatozoa in Non-Obstructive Azoospermia.', 'The role of lipid metabolic reprogramming in tumor microenvironment.', 'Phosphorylation by IKKβ Promotes the Degradation of HMGCL via NEDD4 in Lung Cancer.', 'BDH1 promotes lung cancer cell proliferation and metastases by PARP1-mediated autophagy.']"""

By comparison to men with localised prostate cancer, men with advanced disease report higher levels of psychological distress; poorer quality of life; and have an increased risk of suicide. To date no psychological intervention research specifically targeting men with advanced prostate cancer has been reported. In this paper we present the protocol of a current randomised controlled trial to assess the effectiveness of a professionally-led mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) group intervention to improve psychological well-being in men with advanced prostate cancer.  Methods/design:   Ninety-five men per condition (190 men in total) will be recruited through clinicians in the Australian and New Zealand Urogenital and Prostate Cancer Trials Group and in major treatment centres in Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and Western Australia. Patients are randomised to: (1) tele-based MBCT intervention or (2) patient education. A series of previously validated and reliable self-report measures will be administered to men at four time points: baseline/recruitment, and at 3, 6, and 9 months after recruitment and intervention commencement. Engagement with the principles of mindfulness and adherence to practice will be included as potential mediators of intervention effect. Primary outcomes are anxiety, depression and cancer-specific distress. Secondary outcomes are health-related quality of life (QoL) and benefit finding. Disease variables (e.g. cancer grade, stage) will be assessed through medical records.  Discussion:   This study will address a critical but as yet unanswered research question: to identify an effective way to reduce psychological distress; and improve the quality of life for men with advanced prostate cancer.

DU145 human prostate cancer cells were characterized by the most advantageous Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. The growth and invasiveness of MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells were strongly suppressed by JQFFP, which was accompanied with a decrease in MMP-9 activity and stimulation of TIMP-1 expression. Importantly, JQFFP did not decrease normal human prostate PNT1A cell number, whereas Bax/Bcl-2 ratio decreased which implies increased resistance to apoptosis. In conclusion, JQFFP exhibited a potent antiproliferative effect against cancer cells, inhibited their invasiveness, and decreased expression level of several genes involved in apoptosis, angiogenesis, and metastasis.""","""['Urszula Lewandowska', 'Karolina Szewczyk', 'Katarzyna Owczarek', 'Zbigniew Hrabec', 'Anna Podsędek', 'Maria Koziołkiewicz', 'Elżbieta Hrabec']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Nutr Cancer""","""['Flavanols from Japanese quince (Chaenomeles japonica) fruit suppress expression of cyclooxygenase-2, metalloproteinase-9, and nuclear factor-kappaB in human colon cancer cells.', 'Flavanols from evening primrose (Oenothera paradoxa) defatted seeds inhibit prostate cells invasiveness and cause changes in Bcl-2/Bax mRNA ratio.', 'Chemopreventive effects of Rubus coreanus Miquel on prostate cancer.', 'Inhibition of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins by natural polyphenols: new avenues for cancer chemoprevention and chemotherapy.', 'Enhancement of anticancer potential of polyphenols by covalent modifications.', 'Chaenomeles Species-Characteristics of Plant, Fruit and Processed Products: A Review.', 'Phenolic Acid Profiling of Lactarius hatsudake Extracts, Anti-Cancer Function and Its Molecular Mechanisms.', 'Molecular Basis of Prostate Cancer and Natural Products as Potential Chemotherapeutic and Chemopreventive Agents.', 'Polyphenols Modulating Effects of PD-L1/PD-1 Checkpoint and EMT-Mediated PD-L1 Overexpression in Breast Cancer.', 'Investigation of Phenolic Composition and Anticancer Properties of Ethanolic Extracts of Japanese Quince Leaves.']"""

However, the limited success of several single-agent clinical trials suggest a paradigm shift that the health benefits of fruits and vegetables are not ascribable to individual phytochemicals, rather may be ascribed to synergistic interactions among them. We recently reported growth-inhibiting and apoptosis-inducing properties of ginger extract (GE) in in vitro and in vivo prostate cancer models. Nevertheless, the nature of interactions among the constituent ginger biophenolics, viz. 6-gingerol, 8-gingerol, 10-gingerol, and 6-shogoal, remains elusive. Here we show antiproliferative efficacy of the most-active GE biophenolics as single-agents and in binary combinations, and investigate the nature of their interactions using the Chou-Talalay combination index (CI) method. Our data demonstrate that binary combinations of ginger phytochemicals synergistically inhibit proliferation of PC-3 cells with CI values ranging from 0.03 to 0.88. To appreciate synergy among phytochemicals present in GE, the natural abundance of ginger biophenolics was quantitated using LC-UV/MS. Interestingly, combining GE with its constituents (in particular, 6-gingerol) resulted in significant augmentation of GE's antiproliferative activity. These data generate compelling grounds for further preclinical evaluation of GE alone and in combination with individual ginger biophenols for prostate cancer management.""","""['Meera Brahmbhatt', 'Sushma R Gundala', 'Ghazia Asif', 'Shahab A Shamsi', 'Ritu Aneja']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Nutr Cancer""","""['Enterohepatic recirculation of bioactive ginger phytochemicals is associated with enhanced tumor growth-inhibitory activity of ginger extract.', 'Modulation of cytochrome P450 metabolism and transport across intestinal epithelial barrier by ginger biophenolics.', 'Ginger Phytochemicals Inhibit Cell Growth and Modulate Drug Resistance Factors in Docetaxel Resistant Prostate Cancer Cell.', 'Protective and therapeutic potential of ginger (Zingiber officinale) extract and 6-gingerol in cancer: A comprehensive review.', 'Biological properties of 6-gingerol: a brief review.', 'Plant Exosome-like Nanovesicles and Their Role in the Innovative Delivery of RNA Therapeutics.', 'Immune System and Epidemics: The Role of African Indigenous Bioactive Substances.', 'Exosomes as Novel Delivery Systems for Application in Traditional Chinese Medicine.', 'Polyphenols in Metabolic Diseases.', 'Development of Cyclodextrin-Functionalized Transethoniosomes of 6-Gingerol: Statistical Optimization, In Vitro Characterization and Assessment of Cytotoxic and Anti-Inflammatory Effects.']"""
