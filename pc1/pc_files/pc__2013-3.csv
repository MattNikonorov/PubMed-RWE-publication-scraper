This study set out to explore the possibility that urinary calculi (UC) and PC may share an association by conducting a case-control study on a population-based database in Taiwan.  Methods:   The cases of this study included 2,900 subjects ≥ 40 years-old who had received their first-time diagnosis of PC and 14,500 randomly selected controls without PC. Conditional logistic regressions were employed to explore the association between PC and having been previously diagnosed with UC.  Results:   We found that prior UC was found among 608 (21.0%) cases and 2,037 (14.1%) controls (p<0.001). Conditional logistic regression analysis revealed that compared to controls, the odds ratio (OR) of prior UC for cases was 1.63 (95% CI = 1.47-1.80). Furthermore, we found that cases were more likely to have been previously diagnosed with kidney calculus (OR = 1.71; 95% CI = 1.42-2.05), bladder calculus (OR = 2.06; 95% CI = 1.32-3.23), unspecified calculus (OR = 1.66; 95% CI = 1.37-2.00), and ≥2 locations of UC (OR = 1.73; 1.47-2.02) than controls. However, there was no significant relationship between PC and prior ureter calculus. We also found that of the patients with UC, there was no significant difference between PC and treatment method.  Conclusions:   This investigation detected an association between PC and prior UC. These results highlight a potential target population for PC screening.""","""['Shiu-Dong Chung', 'Shih-Ping Liu', 'Herng-Ching Lin']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Association of bladder pain syndrome/interstitial cystitis with urinary calculus: a nationwide population-based study.', 'Association between chronic kidney disease and urinary calculus by stone location: a population-based study.', 'Association between osteoporosis and urinary calculus: evidence from a population-based study.', 'Prostatic involvement by urothelial carcinoma in patients with bladder cancer and their implications in the clinical practice.', 'Prostatic Calculi: Do They Matter?', 'An enigma: case series of vesical calculi from prolonged and neglected indwelling catheter.', 'Initial Diagnosis and Detection of Very Late Local Recurrence of a Ductal Prostate Cancer due to a Ureteral Stone.', 'Effects of Calcium Oxalate on Expression of Clusterin and Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms in Prostatitis and Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia Patients with Calculi.', 'Risk of ESRD and Mortality in Kidney and Bladder Stone Formers.', 'Familial Risks Between Urolithiasis and Cancer.']"""

Biosynthesis of these selectin ligands occurs by the sequential actions of several glycosyltransferases in the Golgi apparatus following synthesis of the protein backbone in the endoplasmic reticulum. In this study, we examine how the synthesis of sialyl Lewis a (sLe(a)) is regulated in prostatic cells and identify a mucin that carries this glycotope. We treat human prostatic cells including one normal and three cancerous cells with histone deacetylase inhibitors, valproic acid, tricostatin A (TSA), and suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), and then monitor the expression of sLe(a). We have found that SAHA enhances the production of sLe(a) in normal prostatic RWPE-1 cells but not prostatic cancer cells. Employing siRNA technology and co-immunoprecipitation, we show that the sLe(a) is associated with MUC1, which is confirmed by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy and proximity ligation assay. The SAHA-induced production of sLe(a) in RWPE-1 cells is resulted from upregulation of B3GALT1 gene via enhancement of acetylated histone-3 and histone-4. Interestingly, PC3 and LNCaP C-81 cells do not produce detectable amounts of sLe(a) despite expressing high levels of B3GALT1. However, the MUC1-associated sLe(a) is generated in these cells after introduction of MUC1 cDNA. We conclude that the synthesis of sLe(a) is controlled by not only peptide backbone of the glycoprotein but also glycoprotein-specific glycosyltransferases involved in the synthesis of sLe(a). Further, the SAHA induction of this selectin ligand in normal prostatic cells may pose a potentially serious side effect of this drug recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration.""","""['Vishwanath B Chachadi', 'Mohamed F Ali', 'Pi-Wan Cheng']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Comparison of sialyl-Lewis a-carrying CD43 and MUC1 mucins secreted from a colon carcinoma cell line for E-selectin binding and inhibition of leukocyte adhesion.', 'Tumor cell MUC1 and CD43 are glycosylated differently with sialyl-Lewis a and x epitopes and show variable interactions with E-selectin under physiological flow conditions.', 'Analysis of glycosyltransferase expression in metastatic prostate cancer cells capable of rolling activity on microvascular endothelial (E)-selectin.', 'Clinicopathological utility of sialoglycoconjugates in diagnosing and treating colorectal cancer.', 'The Cancer-Associated Antigens Sialyl Lewisa/x and Sda: Two Opposite Faces of Terminal Glycosylation.', 'Multi-omics analysis of tumor mutational burden combined with prognostic assessment in epithelial ovarian cancer based on TCGA database.', 'Complementary Use of Carbohydrate Antigens Lewis a, Lewis b, and Sialyl-Lewis a (CA19.9 Epitope) in Gastrointestinal Cancers: Biological Rationale Towards A Personalized Clinical Application.', 'Selectin Ligands Sialyl-Lewis a and Sialyl-Lewis x in Gastrointestinal Cancers.', 'MUC1 Expression by Immunohistochemistry Is Associated with Adverse Pathologic Features in Prostate Cancer: A Multi-Institutional Study.', 'Glycosyltransferases involved in the synthesis of MUC-associated metastasis-promoting selectin ligands.']"""

The main goal of the present study is to establish a reliable assay system that would allow us to reproducibly reconstitute human prostate tumor regeneration in mice using patient tumor-derived single cells. Using many of the 114 untreated primary human prostate cancer (HPCa) samples we have worked on, here we show that: 1) the subcutaneum represents the most sensitive site that allows the grafting of the implanted HPCa pieces; 2) primary HPCa cells by themselves fail to regenerate tumors in immunodeficient hosts; 3) when coinjected in Matrigel with rUGM (rat urogenital sinus mesenchyme), CAF (carcinoma-associated fibroblasts), or Hs5 (immortalized bone marrow derived stromal) cells, primary HPCa cells fail to initiate serially transplantable tumors in NOD/SCID mice; and 4) however, HPCa cells coinjected with the Hs5 cells into more immunodeficient NOD/SCID-IL2Rγ(-/-) (NSG) mice readily regenerate serially transplantable tumors. The HPCa/Hs5 reconstituted 'prostate' tumors present an overall epithelial morphology, are of the human origin, and contain cells positive for AR, CK8, and racemase. Cytogenetic analysis provides further evidence for the presence of karyotypically abnormal HPCa cells in the HPCa/Hs5 tumors. Of importance, HPCa/Hs5 xenograft tumors contain EpCAM(+) cells that are both clonogenic and tumorigenic. Surprisingly, all HPCa/Hs5 reconstituted tumors are undifferentiated, even for HPCa cells derived from Gleason 7 tumors. Our results indicate that primary HPCa cells coinjected with the immortalized Hs5 stromal cells generate undifferentiated tumors in NSG mice and we provide evidence that undifferentiated HPCa cells might be the cells that possessed tumorigenic potential and regenerated HPCa/Hs5 xenograft tumors.""","""['Xin Chen', 'Bigang Liu', 'Qiuhui Li', 'Sofia Honorio', 'Xin Liu', 'Can Liu', 'Asha S Multani', 'Tammy Calhoun-Davis', 'Dean G Tang']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Improvement in predicting tumorigenic phenotype of androgen-insensitive human LNCaP prostatic cancer cell subline in recombination with rat urogenital sinus mesenchyme.', 'Severe combined immunodeficient-hu model of human prostate cancer metastasis to human bone.', 'PC3 human prostate carcinoma cell holoclones contain self-renewing tumor-initiating cells.', 'Application of Highly Immunocompromised Mice for the Establishment of Patient-Derived Xenograft (PDX) Models.', 'Establishment of a Patient-Derived Tumor Xenograft Model and Application for Precision Cancer Medicine.', 'Understanding and targeting prostate cancer cell heterogeneity and plasticity.', 'A systematic review of the validity of patient derived xenograft (PDX) models: the implications for translational research and personalised medicine.', 'Establishing and Maintaining an Extensive Library of Patient-Derived Xenograft Models.', 'Spontaneous development of Epstein-Barr Virus associated human lymphomas in a prostate cancer xenograft program.', 'Defining a Population of Stem-like Human Prostate Cancer Cells That Can Generate and Propagate Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.']"""

Since androgen receptor (AR) plays a central role in PCa carcinogenesis and progression, it is imperative to systematically elucidate the causal association between AR and miRNAs, focusing on the molecular mechanisms by which miRNAs mediate AR signalling. In this study, we performed a series of time-course microarrays to observe the dynamic genome-wide expressions of mRNAs and miRNAs in parallel in hormone-sensitive prostate cancer LNCaP cells stimulated by androgen. Accordingly, we introduced Response Score to identify AR target miRNAs, as well as Modulation Score to identify miRNA target mRNAs. Based on theoretical identification and experimental validation, novel mechanisms addressing cell viability in PCa were unravelled for 3 miRNAs newly recognized as AR targets. (1) miR-19a is directly up-regulated by AR, and represses SUZ12, RAB13, SC4MOL, PSAP and ABCA1, respectively. (2) miR-27a is directly up-regulated by AR, and represses ABCA1 and PDS5B. (3) miR-133b is directly up-regulated by AR, and represses CDC2L5, PTPRK, RB1CC1, and CPNE3, respectively. Moreover, we found miR-133b is essential to PCa cell survival.

However, this approach can also characterize cells with different phenotypes and biological properties, such as stem cells or cancer stem cells. In this study, we implemented a faster and more precise method for assessing the cloning efficiency of cancer stem-like cells that were characterized and separated using a high-speed cell sorter. Cell plating onto a microplate using an automatic cell deposition unit was performed in a single-cell or dilution rank mode by the fluorescence-activated cell sorting method. We tested the new automatic cell-cloning assay (ACCA) on selected cancer cell lines and compared it with the manual approach. The obtained results were also compared with the results of the limiting dilution assay for different cell lines. We applied the ACCA to analyze the cloning capacity of different subpopulations of prostate and colon cancer cells based on the expression of the characteristic markers of stem (CD44 and CD133) and cancer stem cells (TROP-2, CD49f, and CD44).

The aim of the present study was to explore the effect of BPA on PCa cell migration and the pathways involved in these processes. Using the transwell technique, we clearly show for the first time that the pre-treatment of the cells with BPA (1-10 nM) induces human PCa cell migration. Using a calcium imaging technique, we show that BPA pre-treatment induces an amplification of Store-Operated Calcium Entry (SOCE) in LNCaP cells. RT-PCR and Western blot experiments allowed the identification of the ion channel proteins which are up-regulated by BPA pre-treatments. These include the Orai1 protein, which is known as an important SOCE actor in various cell systems, including human PCa cells. Using a siRNA strategy, we observed that BPA-induced amplification of SOCE was Orai1-dependent. Interestingly, the BPA-induced PCa cell migration was suppressed when the calcium entry was impaired by the use of SOCE inhibitors (SKF96365, BTP2), or when the extracellular calcium was chelated. Taken together, the results presented here show that BPA induces PCa cells migration via a modulation of the ion channel protein expression involved in calcium entry and in cancer cell migration. The present data provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms involved in the effects of an environmental factor on cancer cells and suggest both the necessity of preventive measures and the possibility of targeting ion channels in the treatment of PCa cell metastasis.""","""['Sandra Derouiche', 'Marine Warnier', 'Pascal Mariot', 'Pierre Gosset', 'Brigitte Mauroy', 'Jean-Louis Bonnal', 'Christian Slomianny', 'Philippe Delcourt', 'Natalia Prevarskaya', 'Morad Roudbaraki']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Springerplus""","""['Store-operated Ca(2+) entry in rhabdomyosarcoma cells.', 'Pharmacology of Store-Operated Calcium Entry Channels.', 'Store-Independent Orai Channels Regulated by STIM.', 'Store-operated Ca(2+) entry regulates glioma cell migration and invasion via modulation of Pyk2 phosphorylation.', 'Transient Receptor Potential Canonical (TRPC)/Orai1-dependent Store-operated Ca2+ Channels: NEW TARGETS OF ALDOSTERONE IN CARDIOMYOCYTES.', 'Bisphenol S Increases Cell Number and Stimulates Migration of Endometrial Epithelial Cells.', 'Re-evaluation of the risks to public health related to the presence of bisphenol A (BPA) in foodstuffs.', 'CD36-Fatty Acid-Mediated Metastasis via the Bidirectional Interactions of Cancer Cells and Macrophages.', 'Glucuronidated Metabolites of Bisphenols A and S Alter the Properties of Normal Urothelial and Bladder Cancer Cells.', 'Bisphenols A and S Alter the Bioenergetics and Behaviours of Normal Urothelial and Bladder Cancer Cells.']"""

In the present study, we evaluated the relationship between SPDEF and E-cadherin expression in an effort to better understand the mechanism of action of SPDEF in prostate tumor cell invasion and metastasis. The results presented here demonstrate a direct correlation between expression of E-cadherin and SPDEF in prostate cancer cells. Additional data demonstrate that modulation of E-cadherin and SPDEF had similar effects on cell migration/invasion. In addition, siRNA-mediated knockdown of E-cadherin was sufficient to block the effects of SPDEF on cell migration and invasion. We also show that stable forced expression of SPDEF results in increased expression of E-cadherin, whereas down-regulation of SPDEF decreased E-cadherin expression. In addition, we demonstrate that SPDEF expression is not regulated by E-cadherin. Moreover, our chromatin immunoprecipitation and luciferase reporter assay revealed that SPDEF occupies E-cadherin promoter site and acts as a direct transcriptional inducer of E-cadherin in prostate cancer cells. Taken together, to the best of our knowledge, these studies are the first demonstrating requirement of SPDEF for expression of E-cadherin, an essential epithelial cell junction protein.

The initiation of prostate malignancy and progression to a castration-resistant stage are largely contributed by the modulation of AR activity through its coregulatory proteins. We and others previously reported that p14 alternative reading frame (ARF) expression is positively correlated with the disease progression and severity of PCa. Here, we provide evidence that p14ARF physically interacts with AR and functions as an AR corespressor in both an androgen-dependent and androgen-independent manner. Endogenous ARF (p14ARF in human and p19ARF in mouse) and AR colocalize in both human PCa cells in vitro and PCa tissues of mouse and human in vivo. Overexpression of p14ARF in PCa cells significantly attenuates the activities of androgen response region (ARR2)-probasin and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) promoters. The forced expression of p14ARF in cells resulted in a suppression of PSA and NK transcription factor locus 1 (NKX3.1) expression. Conversely, knockdown of endogenous p14ARF in human PCa cells with short hairpin RNA enhanced AR transactivation activities in a dose-dependent and p53-independent manner. Furthermore, we demonstrated that p14ARF binds to both the N-terminal domain and the ligand-binding domain of AR, and the human double minute 2 (HDM2)-binding motif of p14ARF is required for the interaction of p14ARF and AR proteins. p14ARF perturbs the androgen-induced interaction between the N terminus and C terminus of AR. Most importantly, we observed that the expression of PSA is reversely correlated with p14ARF in human prostate tissues.

It is yet little understood, why IL-24 alone induced apoptosis only in a limited number of tumor cell lines. Analyzing an influenza A virus vector expressing IL-24 for its oncolytic potential revealed enhanced pro-apoptotic activity of the chimeric virus compared with virus or IL-24 alone. Interestingly, IL-24-mediated enhancement of influenza-A-induced apoptosis did not require viral replication but critically depended on toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) and caspase-8. Immunoprecipitation of TLR3 showed that infection by influenza A virus induced formation of a TLR3-associated signaling complex containing TRIF, RIP1, FADD, cFLIP and pro-caspase-8. Co-administration of IL-24 decreased the presence of cFLIP in the TLR3-associated complex, converting it into an atypical, TLR3-associated death-inducing signaling complex (TLR3 DISC) that induced apoptosis by enabling caspase-8 activation at this complex. The sensitizing effect of IL-24 on TLR3-induced apoptosis, mediated by influenza A virus or the TLR3-specific agonist poly(I:C), was also evident on tumor spheroids.

Importantly, the downregulation of MIC-1 in LNCaP-LN3 and PC3M-LN4 cells significantly decreased their invasive capacity and promoted the antiproliferative, anti-invasive and mitochrondrial- and caspase-dependent apoptotic effects induced by docetaxel. The downregulation of MIC-1 in PC3M-LN4 cells was also effective in promoting the cytotoxic effects induced by docetaxel on the side population (SP) endowed with stem cell-like properties and the non-SP cell fraction from PC3M-LN4 cells.  Conclusion:   These data suggest that the downregulation of MIC-1 may constitute a potential therapeutic strategy for improving the efficacy of current docetaxel-based chemotherapies, eradicating the total mass of PC cells and thereby preventing disease relapse and the death of PC patients.""","""['M Mimeault', 'S L Johansson', 'S K Batra']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Br J Cancer""","""['Pathobiological implications of the expression of EGFR, pAkt, NF-κB and MIC-1 in prostate cancer stem cells and their progenies.', 'Cytotoxic effects induced by docetaxel, gefitinib, and cyclopamine on side population and nonside population cell fractions from human invasive prostate cancer cells.', 'Identification of candidate biomarkers of therapeutic response to docetaxel by proteomic profiling.', 'Cell death under epithelial-mesenchymal transition control in prostate cancer therapeutic response.', 'Frequent gene products and molecular pathways altered in prostate cancer- and metastasis-initiating cells and their progenies and novel promising multitargeted therapies.', 'Macrophage inhibitory cytokine-1 in cancer: Beyond the cellular phenotype.', 'GDF15 promotes prostate cancer bone metastasis and colonization through osteoblastic CCL2 and RANKL activation.', 'Pathophysiological role of growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) in obesity, cancer, and cachexia.', 'Macrophage inhibitory cytokine-1 induced by a high-fat diet promotes prostate cancer progression by stimulating tumor-promoting cytokine production from tumor stromal cells.', 'Research advances of secretory proteins in malignant tumors.']"""

Bag5 represents an exception in the Bag family since it consists of 5 Bag domains covering the whole protein. Bag proteins like Bag1 and Bag3 have been implicated in tumor growth and survival but it is not known whether Bag5 also exhibits this function.  Methods:   Bag5 mRNA and protein expression levels were investigated in prostate cancer patient samples using real-time PCR and immunoblot analyses. In addition immunohistological studies were carried out to determine the expression of Bag5 in tissue arrays. Analysis of Bag5 gene expression was carried out using one-way ANOVA and Bonferroni's Multiple Comparison test. The mean values of the Bag5 stained cells in the tissue array was analyzed by Mann-Whitney test. Functional studies of the role of Bag5 in prostate cancer cell lines was performed using overexpression and RNA interference analyses.  Results:   Our results show that Bag5 is overexpressed in malignant prostate tissue compared to benign samples. In addition we could show that Bag5 levels are increased following endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-stress induction, and Bag5 relocates from the cytoplasm to the ER during this process. We also demonstrate that Bag5 interacts with the ER-resident chaperone GRP78/BiP and enhances its ATPase activity. Bag5 overexpression in 22Rv.1 prostate cancer cells inhibited ER-stress induced apoptosis in the unfolded protein response by suppressing PERK-eIF2-ATF4 activity while enhancing the IRE1-Xbp1 axis of this pathway. Cells expressing high levels of Bag5 showed reduced sensitivity to apoptosis induced by different agents while Bag5 downregulation resulted in increased stress-induced cell death.  Conclusions:   We have therefore shown that Bag5 is overexpressed in prostate cancer and plays a role in ER-stress induced apoptosis.

Subjects and methods:   The study cohort comprised previously unscreened men who underwent sextant biopsy owing to elevated PSA (≥3 ng/mL) in two different centres of the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer, Rotterdam (n = 2914) and Göteborg (n = 740). A statistical model, based on kallikrein markers, was compared with one based on established clinical factors for the prediction of biopsy outcome.  Results:   The clinical tests were found to be no better than blood markers, with an area under the curve in favour of the blood measurements of 0.766 vs. 0.763 in Rotterdam and 0.809 vs. 0.774 in Göteborg. Adding digital rectal examination (DRE) or DRE plus transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS) volume to the markers improved discrimination, although the increases were small. Results were similar for predicting high-grade cancer. There was a strong correlation between the blood measurements and TRUS-estimated prostate volume (Spearman's correlation 0.60 in Rotterdam and 0.57 in Göteborg).  Conclusions:   In previously unscreened men, each with indication for biopsy, a statistical model based on kallikrein levels was similar to a clinical model in predicting prostate cancer in a screening setting, outside the day-to-day clinical practice.

One such protein is HMGB1 (high-mobility group box 1). Extracellular HMGB1 has different redox states that play distinct roles in inflammation. Using a unique NMR-based approach, we have investigated the kinetics of HMGB1 oxidation and the half-lives of all-thiol and disulfide HMGB1 species in serum, saliva, and cell culture medium. In this approach, salt-free lyophilized (15)N-labeled all-thiol HMGB1 was dissolved in actual extracellular fluids, and the oxidation and clearance kinetics were monitored in situ by recording a series of heteronuclear (1)H-(15)N correlation spectra. We found that the half-life depends significantly on the extracellular environment. For example, the half-life of all-thiol HMGB1 ranged from ~17 min (in human serum and saliva) to 3 h (in prostate cancer cell culture medium). Furthermore, the binding of ligands (glycyrrhizin and heparin) to HMGB1 significantly modulated the oxidation kinetics. Thus, the balance between the roles of all-thiol and disulfide HMGB1 proteins depends significantly on the extracellular environment and can also be artificially modulated by ligands. This is important because extracellular HMGB1 has been suggested as a therapeutic target for inflammatory diseases and cancer. Our work demonstrates that the in situ protein NMR approach is powerful for investigating the behavior of proteins in actual extracellular fluids containing an enormous number of different molecules.""","""['Levani Zandarashvili', 'Debashish Sahu', 'Kwanbok Lee', 'Yong Sun Lee', 'Pomila Singh', 'Krishna Rajarathnam', 'Junji Iwahara']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Biol Chem""","""['Redox properties of the A-domain of the HMGB1 protein.', 'Immunological Significance of HMGB1 Post-Translational Modification and Redox Biology.', 'Redox modification of cysteine residues regulates the cytokine activity of high mobility group box-1 (HMGB1).', 'A Janus tale of two active high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) redox states.', 'Extracellular HMGB1 as a therapeutic target in inflammatory diseases.', 'HMGB1 in depression: An overview of microglial HMBG1 in the pathogenesis of depression.', 'Changing Perspectives from Oxidative Stress to Redox Signaling-Extracellular Redox Control in Translational Medicine.', 'Acupuncture Ameliorates Depressive Behaviors by Modulating the Expression of Hippocampal Iba-1 and HMGB1 in Rats Exposed to Chronic Restraint Stress.', 'Extracellular Release of HMGB1 as an Early Potential Biomarker for the Therapeutic Response in a Xenograft Model of Boron Neutron Capture Therapy.', 'Fetal inflammatory response at the fetomaternal interface: A requirement for labor at term and preterm.']"""

However, little is known about the genomic architecture of such rearrangements. We therefore designed and optimized a pipeline involving target capture of TMPRSS2 and ERG genomic sequences coupled with paired-end next-generation sequencing to resolve genomic rearrangement breakpoints in TMPRSS2 and ERG at nucleotide resolution in a large series of primary prostate cancer specimens (n = 83). This strategy showed > 90% sensitivity and specificity in identifying TMPRSS2-ERG rearrangements, and allowed identification of intra- and inter-chromosomal rearrangements involving TMPRSS2 and ERG with known and novel fusion partners. Our results indicate that rearrangement breakpoints show strong clustering in specific intronic regions of TMPRSS2 and ERG. The observed TMPRSS2-ERG rearrangements often exhibited complex chromosomal architecture associated with several intra- and inter-chromosomal rearrangements. Nucleotide resolution analysis of breakpoint junctions revealed that the majority of TMPRSS2 and ERG rearrangements (~88%) occurred at or near regions of microhomology or involved insertions of one or more base pairs. This architecture implicates non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ) pathways in the generation of such rearrangements.

In our search for DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitors from Formosan plants, by screening against a library consisting of 12 structurally distinct natural products, we identified kazinol Q {4-[6-(1,1-dimethyl-allyl)-7-hydroxy-chroman-2-yl]-3,6-bis-(3-methyl-but-2-enyl)-benzene-1,2-diol} as an inhibitor of recombinant DNMT1 with IC50 of 7 μM. The effect of kazinol Q on DNMT inhibition was validated by its ability to reactivate the expression of a DNA methylation-silenced gene, E-cadherin, in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Moreover, kazinol Q suppressed the proliferation of MCF-7 breast and LNCaP prostate cancer cells, in part, through apoptosis induction. The role of DNMT1 inhibition in mediating kazinol Q's antiproliferative effect was supported by the protective effect of ectopic expression of DNMT1 on kazinol Q-induced cell death. Molecular modeling analysis suggests that kazinol Q inhibited DNMT activity by competing with cytosine binding, a mechanism similar to that described for (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG). Relative to EGCG, kazinol Q exhibits several desirable features for drug development, including chemical stability and increased hydrophobicity, and might have therapeutic relevance to cancer treatment.""","""['Jing-Ru Weng', 'I-Lu Lai', 'Hsiao-Ching Yang', 'Chun-Nan Lin', 'Li-Yuan Bai']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Phytother Res""","""['Disulfiram is a DNA demethylating agent and inhibits prostate cancer cell growth.', 'Tea polyphenol (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate inhibits DNA methyltransferase and reactivates methylation-silenced genes in cancer cell lines.', 'Identification of potent inhibitors of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) through a pharmacophore-based virtual screening approach.', 'DNA methyltransferase-1 inhibitors as epigenetic therapy for cancer.', 'Development of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors for the treatment of neoplastic diseases.', 'Epigenetic effects of herbal medicine.', 'Recent progress in DNA methyltransferase inhibitors as anticancer agents.', 'Nutritional Epigenetics in Cancer.', 'The Role of Epigenetic Modifications in Human Cancers and the Use of Natural Compounds as Epidrugs: Mechanistic Pathways and Pharmacodynamic Actions.', 'Multiple Myeloma: Challenges Encountered and Future Options for Better Treatment.']"""

Methods:   We retrospectively analyzed 79 patients who underwent FMRI with pelvic phased array coil before radical prostatectomy (RP) performed at University Hospital (UH) of Nîmes. Twelve GR (including three from UH) interpreted the images during their daily practice. FMRI results were dichotomized as positive or negative and confronted to pathological reports for SSECE and side-specific seminal vesicle invasion (SSSVI), with calculation of diagnostic values. The influence of interval between biopsy and FMRI, diffusion-weighted sequence (DWS) and intensity of FMRI, on the diagnostic performance were assessed by Fisher's exact test.  Results:   A SSECE and a SSSVI were observed at FMRI and pathology respectively on 14 (8.8%) and 38 (24.1%) prostate lobes, and on six (3.8%) and seven (4.4%) prostate lobes. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of FMRI for SSECE were respectively 24%, 96%, 64% and 80%; and for SSSVI were 14%, 97%, 17% and 96% respectively. The time between biopsy and FMRI, intensity of FMRI and DWS, did not influence the sensitivity and specificity of fMRI at Fisher test.

Methods:   We retrospectively reviewed 56 consecutive patients who underwent RRP for clinically localised prostate cancer from November 2008 to November 2010. Santorini plexus was isolated and secured in all patients using a new technique of simple digital dissection in which the index finger is used not to only localize the catheter inside the urethra, but also to develop the right plane between Santorini plexus and urethra. This is obtained by gentle bilateral digital dissection through the lateral aspects of periprostatic fascia which are eventually breached by the fingers, developing a right plane just above the urethra. Santorini plexus is then easily ligated and divided. Indicators of outcomes included estimated blood loss, transfusion requirements, operative time, positive margins and complication rates of the technique.  Results:   The maneuver was successful in 53/56 (95%) patients. Mean (range) blood loss and overall operative time for RRP were 620 ml (100-1500) and 130 min. (80-190), respectively. Transfusion rate was 8,9% (5/56). Positive surgical margin rate was 14% (8/56). No complication related to the employed technique was recorded.  Conclusions:   Digital dissection of Santorini plexus during RRP is simple and easily feasible. It speeds up the process of finding the right plane just above the urethra allowing good haemostasis in the surgical field and proper apical dissection.""","""['Cristiano Cristini', 'Giovanni Battista Di Pierro', 'Costantino Leonardo', 'Cosimo De Nunzio', 'Giorgio Franco']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""BMC Urol""","""['Initial dissection of the lateral fascia reduces the positive margin rate in radical prostatectomy.', 'Minor modifications in apical dissection of radical retropubic prostatectomy in patients with clinical stage T2 prostate cancer reduce positive surgical margin incidence.', 'Simplified technique for management of Santorini plexus and puboprostatic ligaments during radical retropubic prostatectomy.', 'Initial incision of lateral pelvic fascia and early ligation of vascular pedicles during radical prostatectomy: potential to reduce positive margin rates.', ""Radical retropubic prostatectomy: control of Santorini's venous plexus."", 'In vivo prostate cancer research: Key interspecies prostate anatomical features for translation medicine.', ""Management with Santorini's Plexus Should Be Personalized during Prostatectomy."", 'Beforehand transection and suturing (BTS) of the dorsal vascular complex: a novel technique in laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.', 'Seperation of dorsal vein complex from the urethra by blunt finger dissection during radical retropubic prostatectomy.']"""

Aims:   The aim of this study is to investigate the sexual quality of life in female partners of men receiving IAIs for pRPED.  Methods:   We retrospectively studied the sex lives of 152 women partnered with men who were being treated for pRPED with IAI and previously had normal erectile function. Women completed the Index of Sexual Life (ISL) questionnaire 1 year after their partner's RP. Male patients completed the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-15), the Erection Hardness Score (EHS) questionnaire, the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire (ICIQ), and the UCLA Prostate Cancer Index (UCLA-PCI) urinary function questionnaire. Penile pain was assessed using the visual analog scale (VAS). Statistical analysis was performed using t-tests, Spearman correlation, and multiple linear regression.  Main outcome measures:   Female sexual life satisfaction (SLS), sexual drive (SD), and general life satisfaction (GLS) were assessed using the ISL questionnaire.  Results:   Mean ages for the 104 couples included were 62.3 and 59.8 years for the men and women, respectively. Mean ISL, SD, SLS, and GLS scores at 12 months were 25.4, 3.8, 14.1, and 7.5, respectively. ISL scores were strongly correlated with IIEF-15 domains, mainly erectile function (r > 0.41, P < 0.00002) and intercourse satisfaction (r > 0.27, P < 0.005). Age and VAS, ICIQ, and UCLA-PCI scores were negatively correlated with some ISL domains. IIEF-15 erectile function and intercourse satisfaction were the most significant domains predicting female SLS. An IIEF-15 erectile function of 25 corresponded to a 75% chance of an SLS score ≥18.  Conclusion:   Indexes of female sexual quality of life were low overall but were highly correlated with the partner's response level to IAI treatment. IAI-related pain, increased age, and poor urinary function of the male partner appear to negatively impact female sex life.""","""['René Yiou', 'Vahid Ebrahiminia', 'Pascal Mouracade', 'Odile Lingombet', 'Claude Abbou']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Sex Med""","""['Sexual rehabilitation and penile pain associated with intracavernous alprostadil after radical prostatectomy.', 'Erection hardness score for the evaluation of erectile dysfunction: further psychometric assessment in patients treated by intracavernous prostaglandins injections after radical prostatectomy.', 'Quality of Life, Psychological Functioning, and Treatment Satisfaction of Men Who Have Undergone Penile Prosthesis Surgery Following Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Erectile function and assessments of erection hardness correlate positively with measures of emotional well-being, sexual satisfaction, and treatment satisfaction in men with erectile dysfunction treated with sildenafil citrate (Viagra).', 'Predictors of Patient and Partner Satisfaction Following Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Experiences of sexual well-being interventions in males affected by genitourinary cancers and their partners: an integrative systematic review.', 'Understanding the sexual health perceptions, concerns, and needs of female partners of prostate cancer survivors.', 'Clinical use of alprostadil topical cream in patients with erectile dysfunction: a review.', 'The role of the sexual partner in managing erectile dysfunction.', 'Feeling well and talking about sex: psycho-social predictors of sexual functioning after cancer.']"""

Limited WB PET/CT FOV can exclude portions of the head, upper, and lower extremities, because there is little perceived clinical benefit to be gained from imaging these areas.  Purpose:   To determine how often utilizing WB PET/CT changes the clinical stage and management compared to each of the limited WB FOVs used for PET/CT.  Material and methods:   We retrospectively identified 556 oncologic patients (804 PET/CT studies) who underwent staging or restaging PET/CT between November 2010 and November 2011. Abnormal hypermetabolic areas that were suspicious for malignancy in areas that are outside of some of the limited fields of view including in the brain, scalp, and calvarium (above the orbital ridge), in the proximal upper extremity (distal to the humeral neck), distal upper extremity (beyond the elbow), proximal lower extremity (distal to the lesser trochanter), and distal lower extremity (beyond the knees) were recorded.  Results:   A total of 8.5% (47/556) of patients had abnormal findings outside the most limited FOV (skull base to upper thighs) used in PET/CT. More patients had abnormal hypermetabolic lesions in the lower extremity (5.9%) than in the upper extremity (2.3%). Similarly, more patients had abnormal lesions in the proximal (6.5%) compared to the distal (1.4%) upper and lower extremities. The stage was only changed in one patient (0.2%), however new lesions noted in the brain changed management in six patients (1.1%). Melanoma, lymphoma, multiple myeloma, sarcomas and stage IV lung, breast, prostate, bladder, testicular, and renal cancer were more likely to have findings outside the most limited FOV (skull base to upper thighs).

Objective:   Our objective was to determine the effects of oral vitamin D3 on vitamin D metabolites and PCa proliferative activity in prostate tissue.  Design and setting:   We conducted a double-blind randomized clinical trial at surgical oncology clinics in Toronto, Canada.  Patients:   PCa patients (Gleason 6 or 7) participated in the study. Of 66 subjects who were enrolled, 63 completed the dosing protocol.  Intervention:   Vitamin D3 (400, 10 000, or 40 000 IU/d) was orally administered before radical prostatectomy.  Main outcome measures:   We evaluated vitamin D metabolite levels and Ki67 labeling in surgical prostate tissue. Safety measures, PTH, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) were also assessed.  Results:   Prostate tissue and serum levels of vitamin D metabolites, including calcitriol, increased dose dependently (P < .03) and were significantly higher in the 40 000-IU/d group than in every other dose group (P < .03). Prostate vitamin D metabolites correlated positively with serum levels (P < .0001). Ki67 measures did not differ significantly among vitamin D dose groups. However, cross-sectional analysis indicated that the calcitriol level attained in prostate was inversely associated with Ki67 intensity and Ki67 (3+) percent positive nuclei in PCa and benign tissue (P < .05). Safety measures did not change adversely with dosing. Compared with the 400-IU/d group, serum PTH and PSA were lower in the combined higher-dose groups at the end of the study (P < .02).  Conclusions:   Oral vitamin D3 raised prostate calcitriol levels (level 1 evidence) and modestly lowered both PSA and PTH. Although Ki67 expression did not differ among dose groups, its levels correlated inversely with prostate calcitriol.

Methods:   We measured 25(OH)D concentrations in a population-based cohort study of 9,949 men and women ages 50 to 74 years in Saarland, Germany. Comprehensively adjusted Cox regression models were applied to estimate HRs and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the association between season-standardized 25(OH)D concentrations and total and site-specific cancer incidence.  Results:   Overall, during a median of 8 years of follow-up, 873 subjects developed cancer; the most common being prostate (171), breast (137), lung (136), and colorectal (136) cancer. Low season-standardized 25(OH)D (<30, 35, 40, or 36 nmol/L in winter, spring, summer, and autumn, respectively) was neither significantly associated with total cancer incidence (HR, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.93-1.30) nor with site-specific cancer incidence. However, a significantly increased overall cancer risk was observed for low 25(OH)D among men, nonobese subjects and subjects reporting low fish consumption and for high 25(OH)D in nonsmokers and nonobese subjects. Accordingly, restricted cubic splines to investigate dose-response relationships curves showed an inverse association of 25(OH)D levels and total cancer risk in men but not in women.

Materials and methods:   From March 2012 to October 2012, a total of 15 consecutive patients were examined with simultaneous 18F choline PET/MRI. At the time of the examination, 8 patients had histologically proven prostate cancer, 2 patients had repeated prostate biopsies with negative results, and 5 patients had suspected prostate cancer with an elevated or rising prostate specific antigene level but did not have a prostate biopsy. Sequence protocol comprised T2-weighted high-resolution images and diffusion-weighted images of the prostate in addition to PET imaging. Image quality was assessed by 2 radiologists, and the PET images were evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively.  Results:   Simultaneous PET/MRI of the prostate was accomplished successfully in all patients. The method proved to be robust without technical failure, and the image quality was rated to be diagnostic in all examinations except in 1 diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) data set that was judged to be nondiagnostic because of susceptibility artifacts. High-resolution T2-weighted images allowed exact correlation of elevated focal or diffuse choline uptake to suspicious T2-weighted lesions of the prostate. A high accordance was found between PET and DWI. However, PET-positive lesions were found in 3 patients wherein DWI did not indicate tumor in suspicious T2-weighted lesions.

Combinations of these biomarkers and with clinical features could improve on prediction.  Materials and methods:   Tissue microarrays (640 patients) with triplicate cores of non-neoplastic prostate, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and index tumor were immunostained with antibodies to numerous biomarkers, digitized, and quantified. We used tree-based classification algorithms to stratify patients into 3 risk strata on the basis of their clinical and pathologic data. Markers were tested for prognostic ability in each stratum (stratum 1 had <10% risk of recurrence; stratum 3 had >60% likelihood of recurrence over a period >12 years). Sub stratification of the clinico-pathologic strata was also pursued.  Results:   We identified a number of significant predictors for PSA recurrence free survival, which were used to construct a predictive model that combines clinical and biomarker data. In the low-risk clinico-pathologic stratum, the markers were predominantly related to non-neoplastic tissues, in the moderate-risk stratum to stromal-epithelial interactions and angiogenesis, while those in the high-risk stratum were mostly oncogenes. Substratification of the intermediate risk group using stromal quantitation and proliferative index successfully, up or down, staged the risk strata for most patients.  Conclusions:   The fact that different biomarkers are most predictive of disease recurrence within different risk subgroups suggests an association between biological processes and prognostic ability. This is the first time that subgroup analysis of markers finds that prognostic ability is associated with biological processes and is proof of concept that distinct phenotypes are associated with risk of recurrence in different types of cancer.""","""['Gustavo Ayala', 'Anna Frolov', 'Michael Ittman', 'Sayeed Mohammed', 'Mike LeBlanc', 'Seth Falcon', 'David Rowley', 'Ruth Etzioni']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Ann Clin Lab Sci""","""['High level of androgen receptor is associated with aggressive clinicopathologic features and decreased biochemical recurrence-free survival in prostate: cancer patients treated with radical prostatectomy.', 'p300 (histone acetyltransferase) biomarker predicts prostate cancer biochemical recurrence and correlates with changes in epithelia nuclear size and shape.', 'High levels of phosphorylated form of Akt-1 in prostate cancer and non-neoplastic prostate tissues are strong predictors of biochemical recurrence.', 'Distinct microRNA expression profile in prostate cancer patients with early clinical failure and the impact of let-7 as prognostic marker in high-risk prostate cancer.', 'Comparison of percentage of total prostate needle biopsy tissue with cancer to percentage of cores with cancer for predicting PSA recurrence after radical prostatectomy: results from the SEARCH database.', 'Expression of ERG protein in prostate cancer: variability and biological correlates.']"""

In men with prostate cancer and Gleason scores 8 to 10, on multivariate analysis after adjustment for other risk features, there was a duration-dependent improvement in BF, metastasis, PCSM, and OS, all favoring LTAD in comparison with STAD or RT alone.

However, the majority of prostate cancer patients receiving the androgen ablation therapy will ultimately develop recurrent castration-resistant tumors within 3 years. Chemotherapy shows little effect on prolonging survival for patients with metastatic hormone-refractory prostate cancer. More than 80% of prostate tumors acquire mutation or deletion of tumor suppressor phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), a negative regulator of PI3K/Akt signaling. Caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) is a strong antioxidant extracted from honeybee hive propolis. Recent studies indicate that CAPE treatment suppresses tumor growth and Akt signaling in human prostate cancer cells. Combined treatments of CAPE with chemotherapeutic drugs exhibit synergistic suppression effects. Pharmacokinetic studies suggest that intraperitoneal injection of CAPE at concentration of 10mg/kg is not toxic. CAPE treatment sensitizes cancer cells to chemotherapy and radiation treatments. In addition, CAPE treatment protects therapy-associated toxicities in animal models.

Available evidence indicates a significant overtreatment of patients with low-risk prostate cancer. Active surveillance has been proposed as an observation strategy to reduce overtreatment and limit curatively intended therapy to those patients who need it. We reported the first Danish results from an active surveillance cohort.  Material and methods:   A total of 167 patients were prospectively followed in an active surveillance programme.  Results:   The median follow-up was 3.4 years (1.1-9.5). At entry the median age was 65 years (51-73), 94% had a Gleason score ≤ 6, 87.4% had a PSA ≤ 10 ng/ml and 99% ≤ cT2a. Ten patients progressed on digital rectal examination, 40 patients progressed due to a short PSA doubling time, and 34 patients progressed on re-biopsy. A total of 59 patients discontinued active surveillance. The estimated five-year probability of remaining on active surveillance was 60.0% (95% confidence interval 50.9-69.1%).  Conclusion:   Active surveillance as a management strategy for patients with clinically localized, low-risk prostate cancer is accepted by patients, seems feasible and can reduce overtreatment.

Currently, many elderly patients resort to increased opioid intake to alleviate the pain. However, this increase in opioid consumption often leads to constipation and further aggravates the anorectal pain, thus leading to a perpetual, vicious cycle. We reasoned that blocking the ganglion impar could attenuate this sympathetically maintained pain, which would lead to a reduction in the consumption of opioids, lessen constipation, and lead to an improvement in the patient's quality of life.  Study design:   Case report.  Setting:   An academic tertiary pain management clinic.  Results:   The authors report the case of a 73-year-old African American man with a history of prostate cancer who presented to the pain management clinic for evaluation and treatment of his chronic anorectal pain secondary to radiation-induced proctitis. The patient underwent a ganglion impar block, using the transcoccygeal technique, and consequently reported excellent pain relief with little or no use for opioid pain medications at a 2-month follow-up.

Patients and methods:   Between January 2008 and March 2012, 3041 patients underwent RARP at our institution by a single surgeon (V.P.). In all, 44 patients were considered morbidly obese with a body mass index (BMI) of ≥40 kg/m(2) . A propensity score-matched analysis was conducted using multivariable analysis to identify comparable groups of patients with a BMI of ≥40 and <40 kg/m(2) . Perioperative, pathological outcomes and complications were compared between the two matched groups.  Results:   There was no significant difference in operative time. However, the mean estimated blood loss was higher in morbidly obese patients, at a mean (sd) of 113 (41) vs 130 (27) mL (P = 0.049). Anastomosis was more difficult in morbidly obese patients (P = 0.001). There were no significant differences in laterality, ease of nerve sparing, or transfusion rate between the groups. There were no intraoperative complications in either group. Postoperative pathological outcomes were similar between the groups. Differences in positive surgical margins and ease of nerve sparing approached statistical significance (P = 0.097, P = 0.075 respectively). Postoperative complication rates, pain scores, length of stay and indwelling catheter duration were similar in the groups.  Conclusions:   RARP in morbidly obese patients is technically demanding. However, it can be accomplished with acceptable morbidity and resource use. In the hands of an experienced surgeon, it is a safe procedure and offers beneficial clinical outcomes.""","""['Haidar Abdul-Muhsin', 'Camilo Giedelman', 'Srinivas Samavedi', 'Oscar Schatloff', 'Rafael Coelho', 'Bernardo Rocco', 'Kenneth Palmer', 'George Ebra', 'Vipul Patel']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['How should we best manage obesity in urology?', 'Perioperative outcomes of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy compared with open radical prostatectomy: results from the nationwide inpatient sample.', 'Outcomes of Extraperitoneal Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy in the Morbidly Obese: A Propensity Score-Matched Study.', 'Age stratified comparative analysis of perioperative, functional and oncologic outcomes in patients after robot assisted radical prostatectomy--A propensity score matched study.', 'Open and robot-assisted radical retropubic prostatectomy in men receiving ongoing low-dose aspirin medication: revisiting an old paradigm?', 'Systematic review and meta-analysis of perioperative outcomes and complications after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Effect of Neoadjuvant Hormonal Therapy on the Postoperative Course for Patients Undergoing Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy.', ""Comparison of Three Approaches to Single-Port Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy: Our Institution's Initial Experience."", 'Should obesity be associated with worse urinary continence outcomes after robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy? a propensity score matching analysis.', 'Obesity leads to a higher rate of positive surgical margins in the context of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.

Three strategies used are transperineal (TP-B), transrectal saturation (TS-B) and MRI-guided biopsy (MRI-B). We compared cancer yields of these strategies.  Methods:   Papers were identified by search of Pubmed, Embase and Ovid Medline. Included studies investigated biopsy diagnostic yield in men with at least one negative TRUS-B and ongoing suspicion of prostate cancer. Data including age, PSA, number of previous biopsy episodes, number of cores at re-biopsy, cancer yield, and Gleason score of detected cancers were extracted. Meta-regression analyses were used to analyse the data.  Results:   Forty-six studies were included; 12 of TS-B, 14 of TP-B, and 20 of MRI-B, representing 4,657 patients. Mean patient age, PSA and number of previous biopsy episodes were similar between the strategies. The mean number of biopsy cores obtained by TP-B and TS-B were greater than MRI-B. Cancer detection rates were 30·0%, 36·8%, and 37·6% for TS-B, TP-B, and MRI-B respectively. Meta-regression analysis showed that MRI-B had significantly higher cancer detection than TS-B. There were no significant differences however between MRI-B and TP-B, or TP-B and TS-B. In a sensitivity analysis incorporating number of previous biopsy episodes (36 studies) the difference between MRI-B and TP-B was not maintained resulting in no significant difference in cancer detection between the groups. There were no significant differences in median Gleason scores detected comparing the three strategies.  Conclusions:   In the re-biopsy setting, it is unclear which strategy offers the highest cancer detection rate. MRI-B may potentially detect more prostate cancers than other modalities and can achieve this with fewer biopsy cores. However, well-designed prospective studies with standardised outcome measures are needed to accurately compare modalities and define an optimum re-biopsy approach.""","""['Adam W Nelson', 'Rebecca C Harvey', 'Richard A Parker', 'Christof Kastner', 'Andrew Doble', 'Vincent J Gnanapragasam']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['The eternal enigma in prostatic biopsy access route.', 'How many cores are enough?

Results:   A total of 559 cancers developed among 19,793 GAD patients with a follow-up of 89,485 person-years (median follow-up of 4.34 years), leading to a significantly increased SIR of 1.14 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.05-1.24].

Methods:   RNA was quantified from paraffin-embedded RP specimens. The CCP score was calculated as average expression of 31 CCP genes, normalized to 15 housekeeper genes. Recurrence was defined as two prostate-specific antigen levels ≥ 0.2 ng/mL or any salvage treatment. Associations between CCP score and recurrence were examined, with adjustment for clinical and pathologic variables using Cox proportional hazards regression and partial likelihood ratio tests. The CCP score was assessed for independent prognostic utility beyond a standard postoperative risk assessment (Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment post-Surgical [CAPRA-S] score), and a score combining CAPRA-S and CCP was validated.  Results:   Eighty-two (19.9%) of 413 men experienced recurrence. The hazard ratio (HR) for each unit increase in CCP score (range, -1.62 to 2.16) was 2.1 (95% CI, 1.6 to 2.9); with adjustment for CAPRA-S, the HR was 1.7 (95% CI, 1.3 to 2.4). The score was able to substratify patients with low clinical risk as defined by CAPRA-S ≤ 2 (HR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.4 to 3.7). Combining the CCP and CAPRA-S improved the concordance index for both the overall cohort and low-risk subset; the combined CAPRA-S + CCP score consistently predicted outcomes across the range of clinical risk. This combined score outperformed both individual scores on decision curve analysis.  Conclusion:   The CCP score was validated to have significant prognostic accuracy after controlling for all available clinical and pathologic data.

The recent U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval of ipilumimab, an antibody that blocks the inhibitory action of CTLA-4, and clinical trials targeting 4-1BB and PD-1 or PD-L1, have underscored the therapeutic potential of using immunomodulatory antibodies to stimulate protective immunity in human patients. Nonetheless, systemic administration of immunomodulatory antibodies has been associated with dose-limiting autoimmune pathologies, conceivably reflecting also the activation of resident autoreactive T cells. Arguably, targeting immunomodulatory ligands to the disseminated tumor lesions of the patient would reduce such drug-associated toxicities. We have recently developed a new class of inhibitory (CTLA-4) and agonistic (4-1BB and OX-40) ligands composed of short oligonucleotide (ODN) aptamers that exhibited bioactivities comparable or superior to that of antibodies. To reduce toxicity, the immunomodulatory aptamers were targeted to the tumor by conjugation to a second aptamer that bound to a product expressed on the surface of the tumor cell, the targeting aptamer, generating a bispecific aptamer conjugate analogous to bispecific antibodies. In a proof-of-concept study in mice, we have shown that an agonistic 4-1BB-binding aptamer conjugated to a prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-binding aptamer led to the inhibition of PSMA-expressing tumors, was more effective than, and synergized with, vaccination, and exhibited a superior therapeutic index compared with nontargeted costimulation with 4-1BB antibodies or 4-1BB aptamers. The cell-free chemically synthesized ODN aptamers offer significant advantages over antibodies in terms of synthesis, cost, as well as conjugation chemistry needed to generate bispecific ligand fusions.""","""['Eli Gilboa', 'James McNamara nd', 'Fernando Pastor']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Clin Cancer Res""","""['Targeting 4-1BB costimulation to disseminated tumor lesions with bi-specific oligonucleotide aptamers.', 'Targeting 4-1BB costimulation to the tumor stroma with bispecific aptamer conjugates enhances the therapeutic index of tumor immunotherapy.', 'Reducing Toxicity of Immune Therapy Using Aptamer-Targeted Drug Delivery.', 'Cancer immunotherapy via nucleic acid aptamers.', 'Aptamer-Targeted Attenuation of IL-2 Signaling in CD8+ T Cells Enhances Antitumor Immunity.', 'Application and development of aptamer in cancer: from clinical diagnosis to cancer therapy.', 'Current Perspectives on Aptamers as Diagnostic Tools and Therapeutic Agents.', 'Aptamers, the Nucleic Acid Antibodies, in Cancer Therapy.', 'CD200 mimetic aptamer PEG-M49 markedly increases the therapeutic effects of pegylated liposomal doxorubicin in a mouse model of metastatic breast carcinoma: an effect independent of CD200 receptor 1.', 'An in Vitro Selection Strategy Identifying Naked DNA That Localizes to Cell Nuclei.']"""

Aberrant miR-152 expression has been frequently reported in various malignant tumors. However, the mechanism of miR-152 in prostate cancer (PCa) remains unclear. This study aims to determine the function of miR-152 in PCa cells and identify the novel molecular targets regulated by miR-152.  Methods:   The expression levels of transforming growth factor-alpha (TGFα) were determined in three samples of PCa and adjacent non-tumorous tissues by Western blot analysis. miR-152 levels in 48 primary PCa and 15 non-malignant tissue samples were measured by qRT-PCR. The effects of forced miR-152 expression or TGFα knockdown on PCa cells were evaluated by cell migration and invasion assays, as well as Western blot analysis. Dual-luciferase reporter assay was used to identify binding sites between miR-152 and TGFα 3'-UTR.  Results:   TGFα was upregulated in PCa tissue samples compared with that in adjacent normal ones. miR-152 expression was significantly decreased in primary PCa samples compared with that in non-malignant samples. Patients with Gleason scores >7 exhibited lower miR-152 levels than those with lower scores. Moreover, low miR-152 expression is correlated with advanced pathological T-stages. Forced miR-152 expression or TGFα knockdown significantly reduced the migratory and invasive capabilities of PCa cells in vitro. TGFα is a direct target gene of miR-152.

Methods:   Data were collected from 818 patients (from 273 centers across Germany) who were pretreated with slow-release luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist formulations and who were about to be switched to the leuprorelin implants. Patients received three injections of 1- or 3-month leuprorelin implant and physicians were asked to complete a case report form specific to each of the three clinic visits. Documented parameters included laboratory measurements, such as testosterone and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, adverse events, and patient- and physician-rated assessments of the therapy.  Results:   Compared with baseline, a significant decrease in both testosterone and PSA levels were measured after the first and second injections of leuprorelin implant.

The genotypes were determined by means of the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism and confirmed with genomic sequencing.  Results:   We found significant association between the genotypes of the MTHFR C677T polymorphism: C/T (odds ratio [OR] = 2.2; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.3-3.9; P = 0.008) and C/T + T/T (OR = 2.2; 95% CI = 1.3-3.9; P = 0.009) with the risk of prostate cancer development, and a slight association with MTRR A66G. Regarding pathological characteristics, we found significant risk between the C/T + T/T genotypes and the Gleason score (7-10) of poorly differentiated carcinoma (OR = 5.2; 95% CI = 1.7-16.2; P = 0.007). On the other hand, a significant association between A1298C, A66G, and A2756G with the pathological characteristics was not found (P > 0.05).

However, the association between genetic variations in the PCGEM1 gene and risk of PCa has not been investigated yet.  Methods:   We investigated the effect of two tagging single-nucleotide polymorphism (tSNPs; rs6434568 and rs16834898) in PCGEM1 gene on PCa risk in the Chinese men. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to assess the association.  Results:   We found a significantly decreased risk of PCa for rs6434568 AC and AC/AA genotype (adjusted OR=0.76, 95% CI=0.60-0.97 for AC; adjusted OR=0.76, 95% CI=0.61-0.96 for AC/AA), as well as rs16834898 AC and AC/CC genotype (adjusted OR=0.76, 95% CI=0.59-0.97 for AC; adjusted OR=0.79, 95% CI=0.62-0.99 for AC/CC), compared with the CC and AA genotypes, respectively. When we evaluated these two tSNPs together based on the risk alleles (that is, rs6434568 C and rs16834898 A), we found that the combined genotypes with four risk alleles were associated with an increased risk of PCa compared with those carrying 0-3 risk alleles (1.53, 1.19-1.97), and this increased risk was more pronounced among subjects of≤70 years (1.80, 1.24-2.62), Gleason score≥7 (1.68, 1.28-2.22) and PSA level≥20 (1.64, 1.24-2.18).

In this study, we explore the relationship between serum glucose at time of treatment and risk of PCa recurrence following initial therapy.  Methods:   The study group comprised 1734 men treated with radical prostatectomy (RP) or radiation therapy (RT) for localized PCa between 2001-2010. Serum glucose levels closest to date of diagnosis were determined. PCa recurrence was determined based on PSA progression (nadir PSA+2 for RT; PSA≥0.2 for RP) or secondary therapy. Multivariate Cox regression was performed to determine whether glucose level was associated with biochemical recurrence after adjusting for age, race, body mass index, comorbidity, diagnosis of diabetes, Gleason Sum, PSA, treatment and treatment year.  Results:   Recurrence was identified in 16% of men over a mean follow-up period of 41 months (range 1-121 months). Those with elevated glucose (≥100 mg/dl) had a 50% increased risk of recurrence (HR 1.5, 95% CI: 1.1-2.0) compared with those with a normal glucose level (<100 mg/dl).

In 2005, the fusion between the androgen-regulated gene TMPRSS2 and members of the ETS family was discovered in prostate cancer. In particular, fusion of TMPRSS2 with ERG was found in approximately 50% of prostate cancers and considered as an early event in the onset of the disease. The prognostic value of this fusion is still contradictory. Bioinformatics showed that overexpression of SPINK1 gene in a subset of fusion-gene-negative prostate cancers was associated with a poor prognosis. In theory, overexpression of the tumor-associated trypsin inhibitor (TATI) protein encoded by SPINK1 in fusion-gene-negative tumor cells opens the way to selected treatments for genotypically different cases. However, their expression has never been assessed at the cellular level in the same tissue samples.  Methods:   As ERG expression has been shown to be a surrogate of fusion gene occurrence in prostate cancer, we have used double immunohistochemical staining to assess expression of ERG and TATI on a large tissue microarray comprising 4177 cases of localized prostate cancer.  Results:   We did not detect any co-expression of ERG and TATI in the same cancer cells, which confirms previous suggestions from in silico studies. ERG was associated with Gleason score (GS), surgical margins and pathological stage, but had no prognostic value in this cohort. TATI was weakly associated with pathological stage but had no significant association with outcome.  Conclusions:   We here provide a morphological basis for ERG and TATI exclusivity in prostate cancer cells. Future therapies should be based on a combination of different targets in order to eradicate tumor cells with gene fusions and cells expressing other tumor-associated antigens.

Population-based family studies can be more informative for estimating risks for rare variants, therefore, we screened for mutations in an Australian population-based series of early-onset prostate cancer cases (probands). We found that 19 of 1,384 (1.4%) probands carried the missense mutation, and of these, six (32%) had a family history of prostate cancer. We tested the 22 relatives of carriers diagnosed from 1998 to 2008 for whom we had a DNA sample, and found seven more carriers and one obligate carrier. The age-specific incidence for carriers was estimated to be, on average, 16.4 (95% CI 2.5-107.2) times that for the population over the time frame when the relatives were at risk prior to baseline. We then estimated the age and birth year- specific cumulative risk of prostate cancer (penetrance) for carriers. For example, the penetrance for an unaffected male carrier born in 1950 was 19% (95% CI 5-46%) at age 60 years, 44% (95% CI 18-74%) at age 70 years and 60% (95% CI 30-85%) at age 80 years.

Using caspase-8 deficient neuroblastoma (NB7) cells for reconstituting non-cleavable mutant forms of caspase-8, we demonstrated that the non-cleavable forms of caspase-8 are capable of inducing apoptosis comparably to wild-type caspase-8, in response to proteasome inhibitor and GST-TRAIL.

Cell growth was estimated by trypan blue staining, activities of the antioxidant enzymes were measured spectrophotometrically, expression levels of the antioxidant enzymes were quantified by digitalizing the protein band intensities on Western blots, and the percentage of apoptotic cells was determined by flow cytometry. Treatment with a low concentration of RSV (25 μM) significantly increased superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in PC-3, HepG2 and MCF-7 cells, but not in HEK293T cells. Catalase (CAT) activity was increased in HepG2 cells, but no effect was found on glutathione peroxidase (GPX) upon RSV treatment. RSV-induced SOD2 expression was observed in cancer cells, although the expression of SOD1, CAT and GPX1 was unaffected.

Methods:   Between April 2002 and January 2011, 75 CRPC patients were treated with triweekly DTX (60-75 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks) (standard-dose group), and 76 CRPC patients were treated with weekly low-dose DTX (20-30 mg/m(2) on days 2 and 9 with estramustine 560 mg on days 1-3 and 8-10) every 3 weeks (low-dose group). Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response and progression-free and overall survival were analyzed in each group.  Results:   Median serum PSA level of the standard-dose group and low-dose group was 25.0 and 35.5 ng/ml, respectively. In the standard-dose and low-dose groups, 57.8 and 65.2 % of patients, respectively, achieved a PSA decline ≥ 50 %. There was no significant difference in either median time to progression between the standard-dose group (10.0 months) and low-dose group (7.1 months) or in median duration of survival between the standard-dose group (24.2 months) and low-dose group (30.6 months). Multivariate analysis with a Cox proportional hazards regression model showed that DTX treatment protocol did not influence the risk of death. Incidences of grade 3-4 neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia were significantly higher in the standard-dose versus low-dose group (58.7 vs. 7.9 %, 16.0 vs. 3.9 %, and 8.0 vs. 0 %, respectively).

This phase I study evaluated the safety, dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), recommended dose for phase II trials (RD), pharmacokinetics (PK) and preliminary antitumor activity of PM00104 as a 24-h intravenous (i.v.) infusion every 3 weeks (q3wk).  Methods:   Thirty-seven patients with refractory advanced solid tumors received PM00104 in a toxicity-guided dose escalation study design (3 + 3 patients per cohort). Plasma samples were collected for PK analysis.  Results:   DLTs comprised severe neutropenia lasting >5 days (n = 4 patients), vomiting, thrombocytopenia, transaminase increases (n = 2 each), fatigue, tumor pain, myalgia, muscle stiffness, creatine phosphokinase increase and dosing delay >2 weeks due to moderate fatigue (n = 1 each). The RD was 4.0 mg/m(2). Most PM00104-related adverse events at the RD were mild or moderate; the most common were nausea, vomiting and fatigue. Myelosuppression and transaminase increases were transient and manageable. PK parameters increased linearly with dose. Higher PM00104 PK exposure was related to a decrease in hemoglobin, neutrophils, platelets and white blood cells. Area under the curve was directly correlated with both incidence and severity of nausea and vomiting. Three patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, esophageal adenocarcinoma and prostate adenocarcinoma had response evaluation criteria in solid tumors stable disease ≥3 months.  Conclusions:   PM00104 given as 24-h i.v. infusion q3wk has predictable and manageable toxicity, but resulted in more myelotoxicity (because of the higher dose level achieved as the RD) and a similar drug clearance compared to 1-h infusion schedules.

Here we show that PTOV1 interacts directly with receptor of activated protein C kinase 1 (RACK1), a regulator of protein kinase C and Jun signaling and also a component of the 40S ribosome. Consistent with this interaction, PTOV1 was associated with ribosomes and its overexpression promoted global protein synthesis in prostate cancer cells and COS-7 fibroblasts in a mTORC1-dependent manner. Transfection of ectopic PTOV1 enhanced the expression of c-Jun protein without affecting the levels of c-Jun or RACK1 mRNA. Conversely, knockdown of PTOV1 caused significant declines in global protein synthesis and c-Jun protein levels. High levels of PTOV1 stimulated the motility and invasiveness of prostate cancer cells, which required c-Jun, whereas knockdown of PTOV1 strongly inhibited the tumorigenic and metastatic potentials of PC-3 prostate cancer cells. In human prostate cancer samples, the expression of high levels of PTOV1 in primary and metastatic tumors was significantly associated with increased nuclear localization of active c-Jun.

Specifically, more research is needed to identify which system components target different patient groups and under what conditions.  Objective:   To explore user characteristics associated with the use of different system components of a Web-based illness management support system for cancer patients (WebChoice).  Methods:   For this secondary post hoc analysis of a large randomized controlled trial (RCT), in which WebChoice was tested among 325 breast cancer and prostate cancer patients who were followed with repeated measures for 1 year, usage patterns of 162 cancer patients in the intervention arm with access to WebChoice were extracted from the user log. Logistic regression was performed to identify patterns of associations between system use and patient characteristics. Latent class analyses (LCA) were performed to identify associations among the use of different system components and levels of social support, symptom distress, depression, self-efficacy, and health-related quality of life.  Results:   Approximately two-thirds (103/162, 63.6%) of the patients logged on to WebChoice more than once, and were defined as users. A high level of computer experience (odds ratio [OR] 3.77, 95% CI 1.20-11.91) and not having other illnesses in addition to cancer (OR 2.10, 95% CI 1.02-4.34) increased the overall probability of using WebChoice. LCA showed that both men with prostate cancer and women with breast cancer who had low scores on social support accompanied with high levels of symptom distress and high levels of depression were more likely to use the e-message component. For men with prostate cancer, these variables were also associated with high use of the self-management advice component. We found important differences between men with prostate cancer and women with breast cancer when associations between WebChoice use and each user characteristic were analyzed separately. High use of all components was associated with low levels of social support among women with breast cancer, but not among men with prostate cancer. High use of e-messages, advice, and the discussion forum were associated with high levels of depression among women with breast cancer, but not among men with prostate cancer. For men with prostate cancer (but not women with breast cancer), high use of symptom assessments, advice, and the discussion forum were associated with high levels of symptom distress. However, it is unclear whether these findings can be attributed to differences related to diagnosis, gender, or both.  Conclusions:   This study provides evidence that different user characteristics are associated with different use patterns. Such information is crucial to target Web-based support systems to different patient groups. LCA is a useful technique to identify subgroups of users. In our study, e-messages and self-management advice were highly used components for patients who had low levels of social support and high illness burden, suggesting that patients with these characteristics may find such tools particularly useful.

We examined the effect of reduced FFAs on glucose metabolism in androgen-dependent (CWR22Rv1) and androgen-independent (PC3) prostate cancer (PCa) xenografts.  Methods:   Subcutaneous tumors were produced in nude mice by injection of PC3 and CWR22Rv1 PCa cells. The mice were divided into two groups (Acipimox vs. controls). Acipimox (50mg/kg) was administered by oral gavage 1h before injection of tracers. 1h after i.v. co-injection of 8.2MBq (222 ± 6.0 μCi) (18)F-FDG and~0.0037 MBq (0.1 μCi) (14)C-acetate, (18)F-FDG imaging was performed using a small-animal PET scanner. Counting rates in reconstructed images were converted to activity concentrations. Quantification was obtained by region-of-interest analysis using dedicated software. The mice were euthanized, and blood samples and organs were harvested. (18)F radioactivity was measured in a calibrated γ-counter using a dynamic counting window and decay correction. (14)C radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting using external standard quench corrections. Counts were converted into activity, and percentage of the injected dose per gram (%ID/g) tissue was calculated.  Results:   FDG biodistribution data in mice with PC3 xenografts demonstrated doubled average %ID/g tumor tissue after administration of Acipimox compared to controls (7.21 ± 1.93 vs. 3.59 ± 1.35, P=0.02). Tumor-to-organ ratios were generally higher in mice treated with Acipimox. This was supported by PET imaging data, both semi-quantitatively (mean tumor FDG uptake) and visually (tumor-to-background ratios).

The aim of this study was to assess the association between the length of the diagnostic interval and the five-year mortality for the five most common cancers in Denmark while addressing known biases.  Methods:   A total of 1128 patients with colorectal, lung, melanoma skin, breast or prostate cancer were included in a prospective, population-based study in a Danish county. The diagnostic interval was defined as the time from the first presentation of symptoms in primary care till the date of diagnosis. Each type of cancer was analysed separately and combined, and all analyses were stratified according to the general practitioner's (GP's) interpretation of the presenting symptoms. We used conditional logistic regression to estimate five-year mortality odds ratios as a function of the diagnostic interval using restricted cubic splines and adjusting for comorbidity, age, sex and type of cancer.  Results:   We found increasing mortality with longer diagnostic intervals among the approximately 40% of the patients who presented in primary care with symptoms suggestive of cancer or any other serious illness. In the same group, very short diagnostic intervals were also associated with increased mortality. Patients presenting with vague symptoms not directly related to cancer or any other serious illness had longer diagnostic intervals and the same survival probability as those who presented with cancer suspicious/serious symptoms. For the former, we found no statistically significant association between the length of the diagnostic interval and mortality.  Conclusion:   In full coherence with clinical logic, the healthcare system instigates prompt investigation of seriously ill patients. This likely explains the counter-intuitive findings of high mortality with short diagnostic intervals; but it does not explain the increasing mortality with longer diagnostic intervals. Thus, the study provides further evidence for the hypothesis that the length of the diagnostic interval affects mortality negatively.""","""['Marie Louise Tørring', 'Morten Frydenberg', 'Rikke P Hansen', 'Frede Olesen', 'Peter Vedsted']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Eur J Cancer""","""['Evidence of increasing mortality with longer time to diagnosis of cancer: is there a paediatric exception?', 'Time to diagnosis and mortality in colorectal cancer: a cohort study in primary care.', 'Aspects of survival from colorectal cancer in Denmark.', 'Survival outcomes of secondary cancers in patients with Waldenström macroglobulinemia: An analysis of the SEER database.', 'Screening of cancer of the most frequent localizations.', 'Ethnic inequalities in time to diagnosis of cancer: a systematic review.', 'Analysis of Time to Treatment and Survival Among Adults Younger Than 50 Years of Age With Colorectal Cancer in Canada.', 'The effect of time before diagnosis and treatment on colorectal cancer outcomes: systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis.', 'Time duration and health care resource use during cancer diagnoses in the United States: A large claims database analysis.', 'Diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer in Denmark during the COVID-19\xa0pandemic.', 'Symptoms and signs of urogenital cancer in primary care.']"""

The aim of this study was to determine the background of such differences in Denmark, Iceland and Sweden.  Material and methods:   Patients with prostate cancer were identified through population-based cancer registers in the three countries. Clinical findings at diagnosis were retrieved from hospital records. In Sweden, clinical information was gathered from regional population-based prostate cancer registers. Country-specific incidence and excess mortality rates were compared, with adjustment for prognostic factors.  Results:   The relative survival in the cohorts was comparable to that in previous population-based studies. Significant differences in excess mortality rates were found across countries, which diminished or disappeared after adjustment for patient characteristics, i.e. metastatic status, clinical T stage and prostate-specific antigen level. A difference in the proportion of patients with metastatic disease was the main explanation of the differences in survival among countries, while the incidence rates of metastatic cancer were similar.  Discussion:   Register-based studies of the relative survival of prostate cancer patients are influenced by national differences in clinical presentation at diagnosis. Differences in the proportion of patients with metastatic spread explained most of the difference in relative survival among patients in Denmark, Iceland and Sweden. Future country comparisons of relative survival should include adjustment for differences in patient characteristics, such as stage, prostate-specific antigen level and screening intensity.""","""['Klaus Brasso', 'Inga Jóna Ingimarsdóttir', 'Ea Rusch', 'Gerda Engholm', 'Jan Adolfsson', 'Laufey Tryggvadóttir', 'Eiríkur Jónsson', 'Anna Bill-Axelson', 'Erik Holmberg', 'Hans Henrik Storm']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Eur J Cancer""","""['Trends in survival of patients diagnosed with male genital cancers in the Nordic countries 1964-2003 followed up until the end of 2006.', 'Trends in the overall survival of cancer patients diagnosed 1964-2003 in the Nordic countries followed up to the end of 2006: the importance of case-mix.', 'Interpreting trends in prostate cancer incidence and mortality in the five Nordic countries.', 'Detection of prostate cancer: the impact of the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC).', 'The natural history of clinical prostate carcinoma.', 'Pre-diagnostic 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and survival in cancer patients.', 'Danish Prostate Cancer Registry - methodology and early results from a novel national database.']"""

Methods and materials:   Five patients with suboptimal rectal dosimetry after iodine-125 seed brachytherapy implant underwent a single transperineal injection of PEG hydrogel into the anterior perirectal fat under general anesthetic using transrectal ultrasound guidance. Prostate-rectum separation and rectal radiation dose before and after PEG hydrogel spacer insertion were measured. Toxicity because of spacer insertion was assessed at Days 0-1 and 4-6 weeks using National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0.  Results:   All patients experienced a clinically significant reduction in the volume of rectum receiving greater than or equal to the prescription dose (RV100) on the postspacer postimplant dosimetry, compared with the prespacer postimplant dosimetry. Mean prostate-rectum separation that was achieved with the insertion of the spacer was 15.1 mm (±3.4). The mean difference in separation from before to after spacer insertion was 12.5 mm (±4.5). This was associated with a reduction in mean RV100 from 3.04 (±1.2) to 0.06 (±0.1) cc. Toxicities were limited to Grade 1 (National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0) perineal pain and rectal discomfort (3/5 patients).

Methods and materials:   Patients received a pretreatment verification CT (vCT) before each fraction. The vCT dataset was imported to the treatment-planning system and fused to the planning CT (pCT) by rigid-body registration based on the implanted fiducials within the prostate. Catheter positions in the vCT were then compared with catheter positions in the pCT in a reconstructed plane through each catheter. Any catheter with difference in penetration larger than 3 mm was manually adjusted by a radiation oncologist before treatment. To evaluate treatment quality, the patient's plan was applied to the vCT off-line and dose delivered to prostate and normal structures were compared with their planned value.  Results:   Forty-four fractions of 13 consecutive patients were treated using this method. Thirty-nine fractions had at least one catheter adjusted before treatment. A total of 651 catheters were assessed, and 194 catheters (30%) were adjusted by an average amount of 5.8 ± 1.9 mm. In eight fractions the prostate D90 would have decreased by more than 10% from the planned value (with a maximum of 32%) if the catheter displacements were not rectified. After the adjustment, the maximum deviation of D90 was 10.6%. The improvement in D90 is 24% per 1 cm of time-averaged adjustment.  Conclusions:   Interfraction catheter motion occurs without any particular pattern. Using pretreatment CTs and restoring each catheter to its planned position ensures that the delivered treatment closely matches the treatment plan and therefore enhances the overall quality of the HDR treatment.

Conclusions:   Seemingly identical nursing care can be measurably different between cancer care centres. Based on the findings the satisfaction variations can be attributed to factors personally experienced by the patients as well as to systemic hospital-level factors.

Few data are available about the effects of ADT on diabetes control among men with diabetes.  Objective:   We examined care for men who had diabetes at the time of PCa diagnosis to assess the effect of ADT on diabetes control, as measured by hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels and the intensification of diabetes pharmacotherapy.  Design, setting, and participants:   This was an observational cohort study using US Department of Veterans Affairs registry data and administrative data to assess HbA1c levels and intensification of diabetes pharmacotherapy among 2237 pairs of propensity-matched men with PCa and diabetes who were or were not treated with ADT.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   We calculated the difference in difference of HbA1c levels at baseline and at 1 and 2 yr in the two groups, compared using a paired Student t test. We used a Cox proportional hazards model to estimate time to intensification of diabetes pharmacotherapy.  Results and limitations:   The mean HbA1c at baseline was 7.24 (standard error [SE]: 0.05) for the ADT group and 7.24 (SE: 0.04) for the no-ADT group. HbA1c increased at 1 yr for men treated with ADT to 7.38 (SE: 0.04) and decreased among men not treated with ADT to 7.14 (SE: 0.04), for a difference in differences of +0.24 (p=0.008). Results were similar at 2 yr (p=0.03). The worsening HbA1c control occurred despite ADT being associated with an increased hazard of addition of diabetes medication (adjusted hazard ratio: 1.20; 95% confidence interval, 1.09-1.32). The limitation of this study was that it was observational and relied on administrative data.

In this study, we determined the ability of seven dietary C-18 fatty acids to cause cytotoxicity and induce apoptosis in various types of human prostate cancer cells. These fatty acids included jacaric and punicic acid found in jacaranda and pomegranate seed oil, respectively, three octadecatrienoic geometric isomers (alpha- and beta-calendic and catalpic acid) and two mono-unsaturated C-18 fatty acids (trans- and cis-vaccenic acid). Jacaric acid and four of its octadecatrienoic geoisomers selectively induced apoptosis in hormone-dependent (LNCaP) and -independent (PC-3) human prostate cancer cells, whilst not affecting the viability of normal human prostate epithelial cells (RWPE-1). Jacaric acid induced concentration- and time-depedent LNCaP cell death through activation of intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways resulting in cleavage of PARP-1, modulation of pro- and antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family of proteins and increased cleavage of caspase-3, -8 and -9. Moreover, activation of a cell death-inducing signalling cascade involving death receptor 5 was observed. Jacaric acid induced apoptosis in PC-3 cells by activation of the intrinsic pathway only. The spatial conformation cis, trans, cis of jacaric and punicic acid was shown to play a key role in the increased potency and efficacy of these two fatty acids in comparison to the five other C-18 fatty acids tested. Three-dimensional conformational analysis using the PubChem Database (http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) showed that the cytotoxic potency of the C-18 fatty acids was related to their degree of conformational similarity to our cytotoxic reference compound, punicic acid, based on optimized shape (ST) and feature (CT) similarity scores, with jacaric acid being most 'biosimilar' (ST(ST-opt)=0.81; CT(CT-opt)=0.45). This 3-D analysis of structural similarity enabled us to rank geoisomeric fatty acids according to cytotoxic potency, whereas a 2-D positional assessment of cis/trans structure did not. Our findings provide mechanistic evidence that nutrition-derived non-essential fatty acids have chemopreventive biological activities and Exhibit 3-D structure-activity relationships that could be exploited to develop new strategies for the prevention or treatment of prostate cancer regardless of hormone dependency.""","""['Jihane Gasmi', 'J Thomas Sanderson']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Phytomedicine""","""['Growth inhibitory, antiandrogenic, and pro-apoptotic effects of punicic acid in LNCaP human prostate cancer cells.', 'Induction of apoptotic cell death in HL-60 cells by jacaranda seed oil derived fatty acids.', 'Apoptosis- and differentiation-inducing activities of jacaric acid, a conjugated linolenic acid isomer, on human eosinophilic leukemia EoL-1 cells.', 'Bioactivity and biotechnological production of punicic acid.', 'Conjugated Linolenic Acids: Implication in Cancer.', 'Punicic Acid Triggers Ferroptotic Cell Death in Carcinoma Cells.', 'Antiproliferation Activity and Mechanism of c9, t11, c15-CLNA and t9, t11, c15-CLNA from Lactobacillus plantarum ZS2058 on Colon Cancer Cells.', 'Jacaric acid inhibits the growth of murine macrophage-like leukemia PU5-1.8 cells by inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.', 'Robust inhibitory effects of conjugated linolenic acids on a cyclooxygenase-related linoleate 10S-dioxygenase: Comparison with COX-1 and COX-2.', 'Anticancer activity of essential oils and their chemical components - a review.']"""

Methods:   Treatment was 4 cycles of docetaxel (70 mg/m(2)) every 3 weeks and estramustine 280 mg three times a day (days 1-5) followed by 15 months of goserelin acetate/bicalutamide. The primary endpoint was the proportion with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) <0.1 with recovered testosterone 5 years after completion of therapy. Secondary endpoints included time to progression (TTP), time to reinitiate androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), the proportion with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), and overall survival (OS).  Results:   Median follow-up was 8.6 years (range 1.3-11.1 years). At 5 year follow-up, 7 patients (11%) had PSA <0.1 (5 undetectable); 8 (13%) had PSA >0.1 but without reinitiation of ADT (median PSA 0.37).

Methods:   IMRT, VMAT and TOMO were planned for five lung cancer patients. Organ equivalent doses (OEDs) are estimated from the measured corresponding secondary doses during irradiation at various points 20 to 80 cm from the iso-center by using radio-photoluminescence glass dosimeter (RPLGD).  Results:   The secondary dose per Gy from IMRT, VMAT and TOMO for lung cancer, measured 20 to 80 cm from the iso-center, are 0.02~2.03, 0.03~1.35 and 0.04~0.46 cGy, respectively. The mean values of relative OED of secondary dose of VMAT and TOMO, which is normalized by IMRT, ranged between 88.63% and 41.59% revealing 88.63% and 41.59% for thyroid, 82.33% and 41.85% for pancreas, 77.97% and 49.41% for bowel, 73.42% and 72.55% for rectum, 74.16% and 81.51% for prostate.

Patient and methods:   We reviewed 451 patients with prostate cancer with a GS of 6 on biopsy, who underwent radical prostatectomy without neoadjuvant treatment. As a preoperative variable, we assessed the independent effect of prostate volume on GS upgrading. To evaluate the association between prostate volume and GS upgrading, we developed multivariate models with volumetric pathological variables, including postoperative tumour volume and percent tumour volume (tumour volume as a percentage of prostate volume).  Results:   GS upgrading was observed in 194 patients (43.0%). As a preoperative variable, smaller prostate volume was an independent predictor of GS upgrading. In regression analysis, prostate volume and postoperative tumour volume were inversely correlated. On multivariate analysis including volumetric pathological variables, tumour volume was a strong independent factor influencing GS upgrading, and prostate volume lost statistical significance after adjusting for tumour volume. Percent tumour volume was inversely correlated with GS upgrading after adjusting for tumour volume.  Conclusions:   Smaller prostate volume was an independent predictor of GS upgrading as a preoperative variable. The inverse relationship between prostate volume and GS upgrading seems to be attributable to cancer biology, which was represented by tumour volume in our study. Percent tumour volume was also inversely associated with GS upgrading.

AND WHAT DOES THE STUDY ADD?: Even after a negative set of prostate biopsies, the risk of undetected prostate cancer remains clinically significant. Predictive markers of such a risk are undefined. In addition to PSA and PSAD, low prostate volume and %fPSA are interesting time-varying risk factors and are relevant in biopsy decision-making.  Objective:   To assess prospectively the time-varying risk of rebiopsy and of prostate cancer (PCa) detection after an initial negative biopsy protocol.  Patients and methods:   Over a period of 10 years, 1995 consecutive patients with initially negative biopsies were followed. Rebiopsies were performed in patients who had a persistent suspicion of PCa. Predictive factors for rebiopsy and for PCa detection were tested using univariate, multivariate and time-dependent models.  Results:   A total of 617 men (31%) underwent at least one rebiopsy after a mean follow-up of 19 months. PCa detection rates during second, third, and fourth sets of biopsies were 16.7, 16.9 and 12.5%, respectively. The overall rate of detected PCa was 7.0%. The 5-year rebiopsy-free and PCa-free survival rates were 65.9 and 92.5%, respectively. Indications for rebiopsy were more frequently reported in patients having a high prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level (P = 0.006) or a high PSA density (PSAD; P < 0.001) and in younger patients (P = 0.008). The risk of PCa on rebiopsies was not correlated with age, but significantly increased more than twofold in cases of PSA >6 ng/mL, PSAD >0.15 ng/mL/g, free-to-total PSA ratio (%fPSA) <15, and/or prostate volume <50 mL. Time-dependent analyses were in line with these findings. The main study limitation was the lack of control of the absence of PCa and PSA kinetics in men not rebiopsied.  Conclusions:   The overall risk of detected PCa after an initial negative biopsy was low. In addition to PSA and PSAD, which are well-used in rebiopsy indications, low prostate volume and %fPSA are interesting time-varying risk factors for PCa on rebiopsy and could be relevant in biopsy decision-making.""","""['Guillaume Ploussard', 'Nathalie Nicolaiew', 'Charles Marchand', 'Stéphane Terry', 'Yves Allory', 'Francis Vacherot', 'Claude-Clément Abbou', 'Laurent Salomon', 'Alexandre de la Taille']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) isoform p2PSA significantly improves the prediction of prostate cancer at initial extended prostate biopsies in patients with total PSA between 2.0 and 10 ng/ml: results of a prospective study in a clinical setting.', 'Use of low free to total PSA ratio in prostate cancer screening: detection rates, clinical and pathological findings in Brazilian men with serum PSA levels <4.0 ng/mL.', 'A comparative performance analysis of total prostate-specific antigen, percentage free prostate-specific antigen, prostate-specific antigen velocity and urinary prostate cancer gene 3 in the first, second and third repeat prostate biopsy.', 'Prostate biopsy: who, how and when.

However, most of the literature consists of small case series and compares RARP outcomes to open outcomes from the literature. This study compared a cohort of high-risk patients undergoing open RP and RARP at a single institution with good follow up. We found no difference in positive margin rates or likelihood of prostate cancer recurrence. This adds to the growing evidence that RARP is a safe option for men with high-risk disease.  Objective:   To compare oncological outcomes in high-risk patients who underwent open retropubic radical prostatectomy (RRP) and robot-assisted RP (RARP) at a single institution. Despite equivalent oncological outcomes between open RRP and RARP, the use of RARP in men with high-risk tumours has been debated.  Patients and methods:   A retrospective analysis of high-risk patients treated with open RRP or RARP at UCSF from 2002 to 2011 was conducted. The relationship between surgical approach and positive margin rate was assessed by multivariate logistic regression Cox proportional hazards regression assessed the effect of surgical approach on time to tumour recurrence.  Results:   In all, 177 open RRP and 233 RARP patients made up the final cohort for analyses. The mean (SD) age was 61.6 (6.6) years and the median (range) follow-up was 27 (2-112) months. RARP patients had less blood loss (median 200 vs 400 mL, P < 0.01) and underwent complete bilateral nerve sparing more often (54% vs 34%, P < 0.01) than those undergoing open RRP. There were no differences by approach in pathological grade, stage, or positive margin rates. However, there was a trend towards higher positive margin rates with RARP early on. Recurrence-free survival was similar at 2 years (84% and 79%) and 4 years (68% and 66%) after open RRP and RARP, respectively (log-rank P = 0.53).  Conclusions:   This study is novel in that it assesses outcomes of open RRP vs RARP in a cohort of high-risk men at a single institution.

We report for the first time that EPFP reduces DU 145 cell proliferation (IC50 = 97 μM GAE for 72 h incubation) and invasiveness (by 24% versus control at 75 μM GAE). EPFP strongly inhibited PNT1A invasiveness in a concentration-dependent manner (by 67% versus control at 75 μM GAE) and did not cause a reduction in their proliferation. Furthermore, EPFP inhibited the activities of MMP-2 and MMP-9 secreted to culture medium by PNT1A cells by 84% and 34% versus control at 100 μM GAE, respectively. In the case of DU 145, MMP-9 activity at 100 μM GAE was reduced by 37% versus control. Moreover, the evening primrose seed flavanols suppressed the expression of selected genes (MMP-1, MMP-9, MMP-14, c-Fos, c-Jun, and VEGF) and also caused favorable changes in Bcl-2/Bax mRNA ratio which render DU 145 cells more sensitive to apoptosis-triggering agents. An additional confirmation of the proapoptotic activity of EPFP toward DU 145 was visualization of characteristic apoptotic bodies by DAPI staining. In conclusion, this study suggests that EPFP may increase apoptosis and reduce angiogenesis of prostate cancer cells.""","""['Urszula Lewandowska', 'Karolina Szewczyk', 'Katarzyna Owczarek', 'Zbigniew Hrabec', 'Anna Podsędek', 'Maria Koziołkiewicz', 'Elżbieta Hrabec']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Agric Food Chem""","""['Procyanidins from evening primrose (Oenothera paradoxa) defatted seeds inhibit invasiveness of breast cancer cells and modulate the expression of selected genes involved in angiogenesis, metastasis, and apoptosis.', 'Flavanols from Japanese quince (Chaenomeles japonica) fruit inhibit human prostate and breast cancer cell line invasiveness and cause favorable changes in Bax/Bcl-2 mRNA ratio.', 'Influence of polyphenol extract from evening primrose (Oenothera paradoxa) seeds on human prostate and breast cancer cell lines.', 'Polyphenols from evening primrose ( Oenothera paradoxa ) defatted seeds induce apoptosis in human colon cancer Caco-2 cells.', 'Growing evening primroses (Oenothera).', ""Evening Primrose Oil Enhances Tamoxifen's Anticancer Activity against Breast Cancer Cells by Inducing Apoptosis, Inhibiting Angiogenesis, and Arresting the Cell Cycle."", 'Polyphenol Extract from Evening Primrose (Oenothera paradoxa) Inhibits Invasion Properties of Human Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma Cells.', 'Phyto-polyphenols as potential inhibitors of breast cancer metastasis.', 'Evaluation of anticancer activity of Cordia dichotoma leaves against a human prostate carcinoma cell line, PC3.', 'Effect of Oenothera odorata Root Extract on Microgravity and Disuse-Induced Muscle Atrophy.']"""

The Vital Status file enabled us to assess longitudinal follow-up for survival analysis. Data from over 3 million beneficiaries were available. The BASF files include summarized data pertaining to condition categories, defined by the Chronic Conditions Data Warehouse (CCW), which was of primary interest for this analysis. Cox regression models were used to assess the mortality risk associated with a set of 15 chronic conditions, as well as severity factors based on summary claims data. We were able to confirm a number of expectations, such as the high level of mortality risk with lung cancer, congestive heart failure, and in the oldest ages, Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. We were also able to identify chronic conditions that behave more as chronic conditions individuals may ""live with"" rather than ""die of."" Depression, diabetes, prostate and breast cancer are present for longer durations and/or are associated with low or no increased mortality risk in the Medicare population. Inpatient confinement or skilled nursing facility utilization were markers for increased risk, as expected. Unexpectedly, frequent physician visits (>10/year) was a marker for more favorable mortality, perhaps indicating that close supervision of chronic conditions lead to improved survival.""","""['Kenneth J Krause', 'Tobias Bloom']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""J Insur Med""","""['Associations among hospital capacity, utilization, and mortality of US Medicare beneficiaries, controlling for sociodemographic factors.', 'Longitudinal rates of annual eye examinations of persons with diabetes and chronic eye diseases.', 'Missing the handoff: post-hospitalization follow-up care among rural Medicare beneficiaries with diabetes.', ""Prevalence of multiple chronic conditions in the United States' Medicare population."", 'County-level variation in prevalence of multiple chronic conditions among Medicare beneficiaries, 2012.']"""

By time-lapse microscopy and force spectroscopy we found PC3 cells to preferentially adhere to bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (SCP1 cell line). Using atomic force microscopy (AFM) based force spectroscopy, the mechanical pattern of the adhesion to SCP1 cells was characterized for both prostate cancer cell lines and compared to a substrate consisting of pure collagen type I. PC3 cells dissipated more energy (27.6 aJ) during the forced de-adhesion AFM experiments and showed significantly more adhesive and stronger bonds compared to LNCaP cells (20.1 aJ). The characteristic signatures of the detachment force traces revealed that, in contrast to the LNCaP cells, PC3 cells seem to utilize their filopodia in addition to establish adhesive bonds. Taken together, our study clearly demonstrates that PC3 cells have a superior adhesive affinity to bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells, compared to LNCaP. Semi-quantitative PCR on both prostate carcinoma cell lines revealed the expression of two Col-I binding integrin receptors, α1β1 and α2β1 in PC3 cells, suggesting their possible involvement in the specific interaction to the substrates.

MCPH1 has also been shown to be downregulated in breast, prostate and ovarian cancers, and mutated in 1/10 breast and 5/41 endometrial tumors, suggesting that it could also function as a tumor suppressor (TS) gene. To test the possibility of MCPH1 as a TS gene, we first performed LOH study in a panel of 81 matched normal oral tissues and oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) samples, and observed that 14/71 (19.72%) informative samples showed LOH, a hallmark of TS genes. Three protein truncating mutations were identified in 1/15 OSCC samples and 2/5 cancer cell lines. MCPH1 was downregulated at both the transcript and protein levels in 21/41 (51.22%) and 19/25 (76%) OSCC samples respectively. A low level of MCPH1 promoter methylation was also observed in 4/40 (10%) tumor samples. We further observed that overexpression of MCPH1 decreased cellular proliferation, anchorage-independent growth in soft agar, cell invasion and tumor size in nude mice, indicating its tumor suppressive function. Using bioinformatic approaches and luciferase assay, we showed that the 3'-UTR of MCPH1 harbors two non-overlapping functional seed regions for miR-27a which negatively regulated its level. The expression level of miR-27a negatively correlated with the MCPH1 protein level in OSCC.

Different genomic rearrangements and alternative splicing events around the junction region lead to multiple combination of Tmprss2:ERG fusion transcripts that correlate with different tumor aggressiveness, but their specific functions and biological activities are still unclear. The complexity of ERG expression pattern is compounded by the use of alternative promoters, splice sites, polyadenylation sites and translation initiation sites in both the native and fusion contexts. Our systematic characterization of native ERG and Tmprss2:ERG variants reveals that their different oncogenic potential is impacted by the status of the Ets domain and the configuration of the 5' UTR region. In particular, expression and activity of functional ERG and Tmprss2:ERG variants are influenced both by translation initiation signals within the different isoforms and by inhibitory upstream Open Reading Frames (uORF) in their 5' UTRs. Stable expression of ERG and Tmprss2:ERG variants promoted cell migration/invasion, induced a block of proliferation and induced a senescence-like state, suggesting a role for these variants in the prostate tumorigenesis process. In addition to Tmprss2:ERG fusion products, a group of related native ERG isoforms is also highly over-expressed in fusion-carrying prostate cancers, and share the same translation initiation site (in ERG exon 4) with the commonly observed Tmprss2 exon1 joined to ERG exon 4 (T1:E4) fusion-derived variant.

The role of PTEN in carcinogenesis has been validated by knockout mouse models. PTEN heterozygous mice develop neoplasms in multiple organs. Unfortunately, the embryonic lethality of biallelic excision of PTEN has inhibited the study of complete PTEN deletion in the development and progression of cancer. By crossing PTEN conditional knockout mice with transgenic mice expressing a tamoxifen-inducible Cre-ER(T) under the control of a chicken actin promoter, we have generated a tamoxifen-inducible mouse model that allows temporal control of PTEN deletion. Interestingly, administration of a single dose of tamoxifen resulted in PTEN deletion mainly in epithelial cells, but not in stromal, mesenchymal or hematopoietic cells. Using the mT/mG double-fluorescent Cre reporter mice, we demonstrate that epithelial-specific PTEN excision was caused by differential Cre activity among tissues and cells types. Tamoxifen-induced deletion of PTEN resulted in extremely rapid and consistent formation of endometrial in situ adenocarcinoma, prostate intraepithelial neoplasia and thyroid hyperplasia. We also analyzed the role of PTEN ablation in other epithelial cells, such as the tubular cells of the kidney, hepatocytes, colonic epithelial cells or bronchiolar epithelium, but those tissues did not exhibit neoplastic growth. Finally, to validate this model as a tool to assay the efficacy of anti-tumor drugs in PTEN deficiency, we administered the mTOR inhibitor everolimus to mice with induced PTEN deletion. Everolimus dramatically reduced the progression of endometrial proliferations and significantly reduced thyroid hyperplasia. This model could be a valuable tool to study the cell-autonomous mechanisms involved in PTEN-loss-induced carcinogenesis and provides a good platform to study the effect of anti-neoplastic drugs on PTEN-negative tumors.""","""['Cristina Mirantes', 'Núria Eritja', 'Maria Alba Dosil', 'Maria Santacana', 'Judit Pallares', 'Sónia Gatius', 'Laura Bergadà', 'Oscar Maiques', 'Xavier Matias-Guiu', 'Xavier Dolcet']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Dis Model Mech""","""['The pace of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia development is determined by the timing of Pten tumor suppressor gene excision.', 'Adenovirus mediated homozygous endometrial epithelial Pten deletion results in aggressive endometrial carcinoma.', 'Temporally controlled ablation of PTEN in adult mouse prostate epithelium generates a model of invasive prostatic adenocarcinoma.', 'Pten gene expression in the endometrial mucosa.', 'The a""MAZE""ing world of lung-specific transgenic mice.', 'Development of adverse outcome pathways relevant for the identification of substances having endocrine disruption properties Uterine adenocarcinoma as adverse outcome.', 'Transient and DNA-free in vivo CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing for flexible modeling of endometrial carcinogenesis.', 'Elimination of Vitamin D Signaling Causes Increased Mortality in a Model of Overactivation of the Insulin Receptor: Role of Lipid Metabolism.', 'PTEN Deletion in Adult Mice Induces Hypoinsulinemia With Concomitant Low Glucose Levels.', 'ARID1A-deficient cells require HDAC6 for progression of endometrial carcinoma.']"""

The dosimeter uses a semiconductor device called a metal-oxide semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) to measure radiation dose. A MOSFET is a transistor that is generally used for amplifying or switching electronic signals. The implantable dosimeter was implemented with the goal of verifying the dose delivered to radiation therapy patients. For the purpose of acceptance testing, commissioning, and clinical implementation and to evaluate characteristics of the dosimeter, the following tests were performed: 1) temperature dependence, 2) reproducibility,3) field size dependence, 4) postirradiation signal drift, 5) dependence on average dose rate, 6) linearity test, 7) angular dependence (different gantry angle position), 8) angular dependence (different DVS angle position), 9) dose rate dependence,10) irradiation depth dependence, 11) effect of cone-beam exposure to the dosimeter, and 12) multiple reading effect. The dosimeter is not currently calibrated for use in the kV range; nonetheless, the effect of the cone-beam procedure on the MOSFET dosimeter was investigated. Phantom studies were performed in both air and water using an Elekta Synergy S Beam-Modulator linear accelerator. Commissioning and clinical implementation for prostate cancer patients receiving external-beam radiation therapy were performed in compliance with the general recommendations given for in vivo dosimetry devices. The reproducibility test in water at human body temperature (37°C) showed a 1.4% absolute difference, with a standard deviation of 5.72 cGy (i.e., SD = 2.9%). The constancy test shows that the average readings at room temperature were 3% lower compared to the readings at human body temperature, with a SD = 2%. Measurements were not dependent upon field size. Due to postirradiation signal drift, the following corrections are suggested: -2.8%, -2%, 0.5%, and 2.5% for the readings taken after 0.5, 1, 5, or 10 min, respectively. Different gantry angles did not influence the readings. The maximum error was less than 1% with a maximum SD = 3.61 cGy (1.8%) for the gantry angle of 45°. However, readings are dependent on the dosimeter orientation. The average dose reading was 7.89 cGy (SD = 1.46 cGy) when CBCT imaging was used for the pelvis protocol, and when postirradiation measurement was taken at 2.5 min (expected 2-3 cGy). The clinical implementation of the implantable MOSFET dosimeters for prostate cancer radiation therapy is described. Measurements performed for commissioning show that the dosimeter, if used within specifications, provides sufficient accuracy for its intended use in clinical procedures. The postradiation signal drift, temperature dependence, variation of reproducibility, and rotational isotropy could be encountered if the dosimeter is used outside the manufacturer's specifications. The dosimeter can be used as a tool for quantifying dose at depth, as well as to evaluate adherence between planned doses and the delivered doses. Currently, the system is clinically implemented with ± 7% tolerance.""","""['Ivan Buzurovic', 'Timothy N Showalter', 'Matthew T Studenski', 'Robert B Den', 'Adam P Dicker', 'Junsheng Cao', 'Ying Xiao', 'Yan Yu', 'Amy Harrison']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Appl Clin Med Phys""","""['Investigations of interference between electromagnetic transponders and wireless MOSFET dosimeters: a phantom study.', 'Characterization of MOSFET dosimeter angular dependence in three rotational axes measured free-in-air and in soft-tissue equivalent material.', 'Dosimetric characteristics of a single use MOSFET dosimeter for in vivo dosimetry in proton therapy.', 'Chronically implanted pressure sensors: challenges and state of the field.', 'P-channel MOSFET as ionizing radiation detector.', 'Air Temperature Error Correction Based on Solar Radiation in an Economical Meteorological Wireless Sensor Network.', 'Uncertainties encountered in implementation of adaptive planning with in vivo dosimeters.']"""

TSP2 protein expression analysis was conducted by immunohistochemistry in a tissue microarray (TMA) containing PCa and BPH tissue samples. TSP2 transcript was down-regulated in PCa tissue samples and cell lines, when compared to BPH and non-tumoral samples (P<0.01).

Notably, the TSP2 epithelial staining score was significantly correlated to vascular invasion and biochemical recurrence in PCa tissue samples (P<0.05). Our data indicate that TSP2 is down-regulated at PCa tissues and cell lines, especially at stroma compartment, which could be related to PCa progression.

The range of (α/β)x values reported for prostate tumors (1.2-5.0 Gy), brain tumors (10-15 Gy) and liver tumors (13-17 Gy) imply that the proton RBE for these tissues could vary significantly compared to the commonly used generic value of 1.1. Our aim is to evaluate the impact of this uncertainty on the proton dose in Gy(RBE) absorbed in normal and tumor tissues. This evaluation was performed for standard and hypofractionated regimens. RBE-weighted total dose (RWTD) distributions for 15 patients (five prostate tumors, five brain tumors and five liver tumors) were calculated using an in-house developed RBE model as a function of dose, dose-averaged linear energy transfer (LETd) and (α/β)x. Variations of the dose-volume histograms (DVHs) for the gross tumor volume (GTV) and the organs at risk due to changes of (α/β)x and fractionation regimen were calculated and the RWTD received by 10% and 90% of the organ volume reported. The goodness of the plan, bearing the uncertainties, was then evaluated compared to the delivered plan, which considers a constant RBE of 1.1. For standard fractionated regimens, the prostate tumors, liver tumors and all critical structures in the brain showed typically larger RBE values than 1.1. However, in hypofractionated regimens lower values of RBE than 1.1 were observed in most cases. Based on DVH analysis we found that the RBE variations were clinically significant in particular for the prostate GTV and the critical structures in the brain. Despite the uncertainties in the biological input parameters when estimating RBE values, the results show that the use of a variable RBE with dose, LETd and (α/β)x could help to further optimize the target dose in proton treatment planning. Most importantly, this study shows that the consideration of RBE variations could influence the comparison of proton and photon treatments in clinical trials, in particular in the case of the prostate.""","""['Alejandro Carabe', 'Samuel España', 'Clemens Grassberger', 'Harald Paganetti']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Inclusion of a variable RBE into proton and photon plan comparison for various fractionation schedules in prostate radiation therapy.', 'The influence of RBE variations in a clinical proton treatment plan for a hypopharynx cancer.', 'Significance and implementation of RBE variations in proton beam therapy.', 'Relative biological effectiveness (RBE) values for proton beam therapy.

Patients and methods:   We extracted from our prostate cancer database all consecutive patients with a minimum follow-up of 5 years after RARP. Biochemical failure was defined as a confirmed PSA concentration of >0.2 ng/mL. All patients alive at the last follow-up were evaluated for functional outcomes using the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) and Sexual Health Inventory for Men (SHIM) questionnaires. Oncological and functional outcomes were reported according to the SCP system. Specifically, patients were classified as using no pad (C0), using one pad for security (C1), and using ≥1 pad (C2) (not including the prior definition). Patients potent (SHIM score of >17) without any aids were classified as P0 category; patients potent (SHIM score of >17) with use of phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitorsas P1; and patients with erectile dysfunction (SHIM score of <17) as P2 category. Patients who did not undergo a nerve-sparing technique, who were not potent preoperatively, who were not interested in erections, or who did not have sexual partners were classified as Px category.  Results:   The 3-, 5- and 7-year biochemical recurrence-free survival rates were 96.3%; 89.6% and 88.3%, respectively. At follow-up, 146 (79.8%) were fully continent (C0), 20 (10.9%) still used a safety pad (C1) and 17 (9.3%) were incontinent using ≥1 pad (C2). Excluding Px patients, 52 patients (47.3%) were classified as P0; 41 patients (37.3%) were classified as P1 and 17 patients (15.5%) were P2. In patients preoperatively continent and potent, who received a nerve-sparing technique and did not require any adjuvant therapy, oncological and functional success was attained by 77 (80.2%) patients. In the subgroup of 67 patients not evaluable for potency recovery (Px), oncological and continence outcomes were attained in 46 patients (68.7%).  Conclusions:   Oncological and functional success was attained in a high percentage of patients who underwent RARP at ≥5 years follow-up.

One of the limitations to current ADT is that it targets all androgen action in CaP, and other, cells irrespective of clinical relevance. The resulting off-target effects are responsible for ADT associated side effects that affect negatively a patient's quality of life. Isolation of the AR-dependent events that drive CaP progression may lead to novel forms of ADT that are at least as effective but more selective. Here, an approach is described that starts from insights in the basic mechanism(s) by which AR regulates target gene expression to identify novel drugable targets downstream of AR. Exploration of the molecular events that underlie androgen regulation of the AR-associated coregulator FHL2 led to the isolation of a novel indirect mechanism of androgen action that is mediated by the secondary transcription factor Serum Response Factor (SRF). Using a combination of oligoarray and in silico analyses, an SRF-dependent fraction of AR action was identified that is enriched in CaP tissues, is able to discriminate between benign and malignant prostate, and correlates with aggressive disease and biochemical failure. The RhoA signaling axis, a well known upstream stimulator of SRF action that harbors drugable targets, conveyed androgen-responsiveness to SRF, and was activated in CaP where it correlates with increased CaP aggressiveness and poor outcome after surgery.""","""['Hannelore V Heemers']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Curr Drug Targets""","""['Protein Kinase N1 control of androgen-responsive serum response factor action provides rationale for novel prostate cancer treatment strategy.', 'RhoA as a mediator of clinically relevant androgen action in prostate cancer cells.', 'Androgen induction of the androgen receptor coactivator four and a half LIM domain protein-2: evidence for a role for serum response factor in prostate cancer.', 'Androgen action in the prostate gland.', 'Targeting androgen receptor action for prostate cancer treatment: does the post-receptor level provide novel opportunities?', 'Protein Kinase N1 control of androgen-responsive serum response factor action provides rationale for novel prostate cancer treatment strategy.']"""

There is potential for further optimization of candidate selection for salvage cryoablation with curative intent and nadir PSA achieved after whole-gland cryotherapy may provide additional prognostic value. The study shows that the most important prognostic factors of biochemical progression-free survival for patients who have undergone whole-gland salvage prostate cryotherapy are nadir PSA achieved after therapy and pre-therapy biopsy Gleason score. Based on these two prognostic variables, we have identified risk stratification groups (low, intermediate and high) which help predict the expected outcomes of salvage whole-gland prostate cryotherapy in a given patient. This risk stratification constitutes a useful clinical tool in defining which patients maybe best suited for this local salvage treatment method.  Objective:   To assess the prognostic variables predicting the risk of biochemical progression-free survival (bPFS) after salvage prostate whole-gland cryotherapy using the Phoenix definition of bPFS.  Patients and methods:   A total of 132 patients underwent prostate whole-gland salvage cryotherapy with curative intent. No patient underwent neoadjuvant/adjuvant hormonal ablative therapy, and all had extended post-salvage prostate-specific antigen (PSA) follow-up data. Cox univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses of potential predictors of bPFS were conducted. Kaplan-Meier analyses of bPFS was also performed.  Results:   At a mean (range) follow-up of 4.3 (0.9-12.7) years, the median (range) post-cryotherapy nadir PSA achieved was 0.17 (0-33.9) ng/mL. On multivariate analysis, predictors of bPFS were nadir PSA post-cryotherapy and pre-salvage biopsy Gleason score (P < 0.001 and 0.009, respectively). Risk stratification groups (low, intermediate and high) were developed based on the presence of zero, one or two adverse risk factors, the risk factors being either a nadir PSA >2.5 ng/mL or biopsy Gleason score ≥ 7, with the Kaplan-Meier bPFS curves of these risk groups being significantly different (P = 0.02 and <0.001, respectively).  Conclusions:   Post-salvage nadir PSA and pre-salvage biopsy Gleason score are important predictors of outcome in this patient cohort.

Here, we report that (S)-2, a novel hydroxamate-based HDACi, shown previously to be effective against acute myeloid leukemia cells, was also a potent inducer of apoptosis/differentiation in human prostate LNCaP and PC3 cancer cells. In LNCaP cells (S)-2 was capable of triggering H3/H4 histone acetylation, H2AX phosphorylation as a marker of DNA damage and producing G0/G1 cell cycle arrest. Consistently, (S)-2 led to enhanced expression of both the protein and mRNA p21 levels in LNCaP cells but, contrary to SAHA, not in normal non-tumorigenic prostate PNT1A cells. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that (S)-2-induced apoptosis in LNCaP cells developed through the cleavage of pro-caspase 9 and 3 and of poly(ADP-ribose)-polymerase accompanied by the dose-dependent loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. Indeed, the addition of the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk greatly reduced drug-mediated apoptosis while the antioxidant N-acetyl-cysteine was virtually ineffective. Importantly, preliminary data with nude mice xenografted with LNCaP cells showed that (S)-2 prompted a decrease in the tumor volume and an increase in H2AX phosphorylation within the cancer cells. Moreover, the highly metastatic prostate cancer PC3 cells were also sensitive to (S)-2 that: i) induced growth arrest and moderate apoptosis; ii) steered cells towards differentiation and neutral lipid accumulation; iii) reduced cell invasiveness potential by decreasing the amount of MMP-9 activity and up-regulating TIMP-1 expression; and iv) inhibited cell motility and migration through the Matrigel. Overall, (S)-2 has proven to be a powerful HDACi capable of inducing growth arrest, cell death and/or differentiation of LNCaP and PC3 prostate cancer cells and, due to its low toxicity and efficacy in vivo, might also be of clinical interest to support conventional prostate cancer therapy.""","""['Anna Laurenzana', 'Manjola Balliu', 'Cristina Cellai', 'Maria Novella Romanelli', 'Francesco Paoletti']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['A novel histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor MHY219\xa0induces apoptosis via up-regulation of androgen receptor expression in human prostate cancer cells.', 'Differential effects of PXD101 (belinostat) on androgen-dependent and androgen-independent prostate cancer models.', 'A novel histone deacetylase inhibitor, CG200745, potentiates anticancer effect of docetaxel in prostate cancer via decreasing Mcl-1 and Bcl-XL.', 'Superior activity of a new histone deacetylase inhibitor (ZYJ-34c) in inhibiting growth of human leukemia cells by inducing p21WAF1 expression and cell cycle arrest.', 'Mechanisms of Histone Deacetylase Inhibitor-Regulated Gene Expression in Cancer Cells.', 'Cytostatic Action of Novel Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors in Androgen Receptor-Null Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'A potentiated cooperation of carbonic anhydrase IX and histone deacetylase inhibitors against cancer.', 'Prostate Cancer: Epigenetic Alterations, Risk Factors, and Therapy.', 'Activation of AMP-activated Protein Kinase by Metformin Induces Protein Acetylation in Prostate and Ovarian Cancer Cells.', 'HDAC1 controls CIP2A transcription in human colorectal cancer cells.']"""

Resveratrol found in red wine, has anticancer activity in various tumor types. We reported earlier on a new molecular target of resveratrol, the metastasis-associated protein 1 (MTA1), which is a part of nucleosome remodeling and deacetylation (NuRD) co-repressor complex that mediates gene silencing. We identified resveratrol as a regulator of MTA1/NuRD complex and re-activator of p53 acetylation in prostate cancer (PCa). In the current study, we addressed whether resveratrol analogues also possess the ability to inhibit MTA1 and to reverse p53 deacetylation. We demonstrated that pterostilbene (PTER), found in blueberries, had greater increase in MTA1-mediated p53 acetylation, confirming superior potency over resveratrol as dietary epigenetic agent. In orthotopic PCa xenografts, resveratrol and PTER significantly inhibited tumor growth, progression, local invasion and spontaneous metastasis. Furthermore, MTA1-knockdown sensitized cells to these agents resulting in additional reduction of tumor progression and metastasis. The reduction was dependent on MTA1 signaling showing increased p53 acetylation, higher apoptotic index and less angiogenesis in vivo in all xenografts treated with the compounds, and particularly with PTER. Altogether, our results indicate MTA1 as a major contributor in prostate tumor malignant progression, and support the use of strategies targeting MTA1.

In our previous study, we found that the C-terminal region of Mesd, which is absent in sequences from invertebrates, is necessary and sufficient for binding to mature LRP6 on the cell surface. In the present studies, we further characterized the interaction between the C-terminal region Mesd peptide and LRP5/6. We found that Mesd C-terminal region-derived peptides block Mesd binding to LRP5 at the cell surface too. We also showed that there are two LRP5/6 binding sites within Mesd C-terminal region which contain several positively charged residues. Moreover, we demonstrated that the Mesd C-terminal region peptide, like the full-length Mesd protein, blocked Wnt 3A- and Rspodin1-induced Wnt/β-catenin signaling in LRP5- and LRP6- expressing cells, suppressed Wnt/β-catenin signaling in human breast HS578T cells and prostate cancer PC-3 cells, and inhibited cancer cell proliferation, although the full-length Mesd protein is more potent than its peptide. Finally, we found that treatment of the full-length Mesd protein and its C-terminal region peptide significantly increased chemotherapy agent Adriamycin-induced cytotoxicity in HS578T and PC-3 cells.

CXCR4 is generally regarded as a plasma membrane receptor where it transmits signals that support transformation, progression and eventual metastasis. Due to the central role of CXCR4 in tumorigenesis, therapeutics approaches such as antagonist and monoclonal antibodies have focused on receptors that exist on the plasma membrane. An emerging concept for G-protein coupled receptors is that they may localize to and associate with the nucleus where they retain function and mediate nuclear signaling. Herein, we demonstrate that CXCR4 associated with the nucleus of malignant prostate cancer tissues. Likewise, expression of CXCR4 was detected in nuclear fractions among several prostate cancer cell lines, compared to normal prostate epithelial cells. Our studies identified a nuclear pool of CXCR4 and we defined a nuclear transport pathway for CXCR4. We reveal a putative nuclear localization sequence (NLS), 'RPRK', within CXCR4 that contributed to nuclear localization. Additionally, nuclear CXCR4 interacted with Transportinβ1 and Transportinβ1-binding to CXCR4 promoted its nuclear translocation. Importantly, Gαi immunoprecipitation and calcium mobilization studies indicated that nuclear CXCR4 was functional and participated in G-protein signaling, revealing that the nuclear pool of CXCR4 retained function. Given the suggestion that functional, nuclear CXCR4 may be a mechanism underlying prostate cancer recurrence, increased metastatic ability and poorer prognosis after tumors have been treated with therapy that targets plasma membrane CXCR4, these studies addresses a novel mechanism of nuclear signaling for CXCR4, a novel mechanism of clinical targeting, and demonstrate an active nuclear pool that provides important new information to illuminate what has been primarily clinical reports of nuclear CXCR4.""","""['Ayesha S Don-Salu-Hewage', 'Siu Yuen Chan', 'Kathleen M McAndrews', 'Mahandranauth A Chetram', 'Michelle R Dawson', 'Danaya A Bethea', 'Cimona V Hinton']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['A feed-forward loop between nuclear translocation of CXCR4 and HIF-1α promotes renal cell carcinoma metastasis.', 'The CXCL12/CXCR4 axis promotes ligand-independent activation of the androgen receptor.', 'A novel cross-talk between CXCR4 and PI4KIIIα in prostate cancer cells.', 'Androgen receptor and chemokine receptors 4 and 7 form a signaling axis to regulate CXCL12-dependent cellular motility.', 'The association of CXCR4 expression with clinicopathological significance and potential drug target in prostate cancer: a meta-analysis and literature review.', 'Differential Expression and Clinical Relevance of C-X-C Motif Chemokine Receptor 4 (CXCR4) in Renal Cell Carcinomas, Benign Renal Tumors, and Metastases.', 'Emerging RNA-Based Therapeutic and Diagnostic Options: Recent Advances and Future Challenges in Genitourinary Cancers.', 'GPCRs in Intracellular Compartments: New Targets for Drug Discovery.', 'Regulating Phase Transition in Neurodegenerative Diseases by Nuclear Import Receptors.', 'Repositioning of Old Drugs for Novel Cancer Therapies: Continuous Therapeutic Perfusion of Aspirin and Oseltamivir Phosphate with Gemcitabine Treatment Disables Tumor Progression, Chemoresistance, and Metastases.']"""

FGF8b has been considered as a potential target for prostate cancer therapy. Here we isolated 12 specific FGF8b-binding phage clones by screening a phage display heptapeptide library with FGF8b. The peptide (HSQAAVP, named as P12) corresponding to one of these clones showed high homology to the immunoglobulin-like (Ig-like) domain II(D2) of high-affinity FGF8b receptor (FGFR3c), contained 3 identical amino acids (AVP) to the authentic FGFR3 D2 sequence aa 163-169 (LLAVPAA) directly participating in ligand binding, carried the same charges as its corresponding motif (aa163-169) in FGFR3c, suggesting that P12 may have a greater potential to interrupt FGF8b binding to its receptors than other identified heptapeptides do. Functional analysis indicated that synthetic P12 peptides mediate significant inhibition of FGF8b-induced cell proliferation, arrest cell cycle at the G0/G1 phase via suppression of Cyclin D1 and PCNA, and blockade of the activations of Erk1/2 and Akt cascades in both prostate cancer cells and vascular endothelial cells.

In this study, we have shown that curcumin can suppress epidermal growth factor (EGF)- stimulated and heregulin-stimulated PC-3 cell invasion, as well as androgen-induced LNCaP cell invasion. Curcumin treatment significantly resulted in reduced matrix metalloproteinase 9 activity and downregulation of cellular matriptase, a membrane-anchored serine protease with oncogenic roles in tumor formation and invasion. Our data further show that curcumin is able to inhibit the induction effects of androgens and EGF on matriptase activation, as well as to reduce the activated levels of matriptase after its overexpression, thus suggesting that curcumin may interrupt diverse signal pathways to block the protease. Furthermore, the reduction of activated matriptase in cells by curcumin was also partly due to curcumin's effect on promoting the shedding of matriptase into an extracellular environment, but not via altering matriptase gene expression. In addition, curcumin significantly suppressed the invasive ability of prostate cancer cells induced by matriptase overexpression. In xenograft model, curcumin not only inhibits prostate cancer tumor growth and metastasis but also downregulates matriptase activity in vivo.

Incontinence did not correlate with EUS or IUS dose.  Conclusions:   Doses to the IUS and EUS on MRI/CT predicted worse urinary function, with greater bother, irritative symptoms, and urgency. Incorporating MRI-based dose-volume histogram analysis into the treatment planning process may reduce acute urinary morbidity after brachytherapy.""","""['Steven P Register', 'Rajat J Kudchadker', 'Lawrence B Levy', 'David A Swanson', 'Thomas J Pugh', 'Teresa L Bruno', 'Steven J Frank']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Brachytherapy""","""['The nature and extent of urinary morbidity in relation to prostate brachytherapy urethral dosimetry.', 'Acute genitourinary toxicity after high dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy combined with hypofractionated external-beam radiation therapy for localized prostate cancer: Second analysis to determine the correlation between the urethral dose in HDR brachytherapy and the severity of acute genitourinary toxicity.', 'Quality of life after high-dose-rate brachytherapy monotherapy for prostate cancer.', 'Urinary morbidity and incontinence following transurethral resection of the prostate after brachytherapy.', 'Quality of life study in prostate cancer patients treated with three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy: comparing late bowel and bladder quality of life symptoms to that of the normal population.', 'Validation of the bladder neck as an important organ at risk in prostate seed brachytherapy based on D2cc: A single-institution, retrospective review.', 'Clinical use of magnetic resonance imaging across the prostate brachytherapy workflow.', 'Development of a magnetic resonance imaging protocol to visualize encapsulated contrast agent markers in prostate brachytherapy recipients: initial patient experience.', 'Template guided transperineal saturation biopsy of the prostate: lessons for focal and urethra-sparing high-dose-rate brachytherapy for localized prostate cancer.', 'Reduced dose to urethra and rectum with the use of variable needle spacing in prostate brachytherapy: a potential role for robotic technology.']"""

Materials and methods:   We evaluated PHI and PCA3 performance in 211 patients undergoing initial (116) or repeat (95) prostate biopsy. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was done using the AUC to test the accuracy of PHI and PCA3 for predicting prostate cancer in the overall population and in each setting. Decision curve analysis was used to compare the clinical benefit of different models.  Results:   Overall, the AUC of the PHI (0.70) was significantly higher than the AUC of PCA3 (0.59), total prostate specific antigen (0.56) and free-to-total prostate specific antigen (0.60) (p = 0.043, 0.002 and 0.037, respectively). PHI was more accurate than PCA3 for predicting prostate cancer in the initial setting (AUC 0.69 vs 0.57) and in the repeat setting (AUC 0.72 vs 0.63), although no statistically significant difference was observed. Including PCA3 in the base multivariable model (prostate specific antigen plus free-to-total prostate specific antigen plus prostate volume) did not increase predictive accuracy in either setting (AUC 0.79 vs 0.80 and 0.75 vs 0.76, respectively). Conversely, including PHI in the base multivariable model improved predictive accuracy by 5% (AUC 0.79 to 0.84) and 6% (AUC 0.75 to 0.81) in the initial and repeat prostate biopsy settings, respectively. On decision curve analysis the highest net benefit was observed when PHI was added to the base multivariable model.

The aim of our study was to evaluate the usefulness of perfusion weighted MR imaging (PWI), including signal-intensity curves analysis in the differential diagnosis of sellar/parasellar tumors.  Methods:   Forty-one patients with sellar/parasellar tumors (23 macroadenomas, 10 meningiomas, 5 craniopharyngiomas, 1 intrasellar hemangioblastoma, 1 intrasellar prostate cancer metastasis, 1 suprasellar glioma), underwent plain MRI followed by PWI using a 1.5T unit. In each tumor, the mean and maximum values of relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV), as well as the relative peak height (rPH) and the relative percentage of signal intensity recovery (rPSR) were calculated.  Results:   The high perfusion tumors were: macroadenomas, meningiomas, squamous-papillary type of craniopharyngiomas, hemangioblastoma, glioma and metastasis. The low perfusion neoplasms included adamantinomatous type of craniopharyngiomas. By comparing adenomas and meningiomas, we found statistically significant differences in the mean and maximum rCBV values (p=0.026 and p=0.019, respectively), but not in rPH and rPSR. The maximum rCBV values >7.14 and the mean rCBV values >5.74 with the typical perfusion curve were very suggestive of the diagnosis of meningioma. There were differences between adenomas and other high perfusion tumors in rPH and rPSR values.  Conclusions:   PWI can provide additional information helpful in differential diagnosis of sellar/parasellar tumors.

However, current metronomic chemotherapy mainly focuses on free small-molecule drugs, without any effort to achieve tumor-specific biodistribution, which may lead to long-term toxicity concerns. Metronomic chemotherapy using nanoparticulate drug delivery system (DDS) offers significant upside to reduce off-target side effects, decrease accumulated dose, and enhance the efficacy of tumor vessel targeting without compromising antitumor efficacy; but there has been a lack of thorough experimental data describing the targeted metronomic chemotherapy. Here, we develop a new nanoparticulate DDS, SP5.2 peptide conjugated, Flt-1 (VEGFR-1) targeted nanoparticles for docetaxel (SP5.2-DTX-NP), as a model for the investigation of targeted metronomic chemotherapy with respect to both antitumor efficacy and toxicity. The results demonstrate that metronomic SP5.2-DTX-NP exerts antitumor activity mainly through the antiangiogenic effect of docetaxel, which is specifically delivered into the tumor vascular endothelial cells through the nanoparticle internalization mediated by the interaction of SP5.2 and over-expressed Flt-1 receptors on tumor vessels. Moreover, the antitumor efficacy of targeted metronomic chemotherapy is better than that of the treatment with the DDS given in the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) regimen, which is shown in significantly prolonged mice survival and minimal drug-associated toxicity (bone marrow suppression, hematological toxicity, and mucosal injury of small intestine). The present research reveals and highlights the significance of targeted metronomic therapy with nanoparticulate DDS in antiangiogenic cancer therapy.""","""['De-Hong Yu', 'Fu-Qiang Ban', 'Mei Zhao', 'Qin Lu', 'Jonathan F Lovell', 'Fan Bai', 'Chao Wang', 'Ying-Yun Guan', 'Xin Luan', 'Ya-Rong Liu', 'Chao Fang', 'Hong-Zhuan Chen']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Biomaterials""","""['Selective eradication of tumor vascular pericytes by peptide-conjugated nanoparticles for antiangiogenic therapy of melanoma lung metastasis.', 'Delta-like ligand 4-targeted nanomedicine for antiangiogenic cancer therapy.', 'Synergistic antitumor effects of combination treatment with metronomic doxorubicin and VEGF-targeting RNAi nanoparticles.', ""The potential clinical promise of 'multimodality' metronomic chemotherapy revealed by preclinical studies of metastatic disease."", 'Metronomic chemotherapy and nanocarrier platforms.', 'Recent advances in near-infrared-II hollow nanoplatforms for photothermal-based cancer treatment.', 'Combination of metronomic administration and target delivery strategies to improve the anti-angiogenic and anti-tumor effects of triptolide.', 'A Tumor Vascular-Targeted Interlocking Trimodal Nanosystem That Induces and Exploits Hypoxia.', 'Endocytic Pathways Used by Andes Virus to Enter Primary Human Lung Endothelial Cells.', 'How nanotechnology can enhance docetaxel therapy.']"""

Use of parenteral oestrogen could avoid the long-term complications associated with LHRHa and the thromboembolic complications associated with oral oestrogen.  Methods:   In this multicentre, open-label, randomised, phase 2 trial, we enrolled men with locally advanced or metastatic prostate cancer scheduled to start indefinite hormone therapy. Randomisation was by minimisation, in a 2:1 ratio, to four self-administered oestrogen patches (100 μg per 24 h) changed twice weekly or LHRHa given according to local practice. After castrate testosterone concentrations were reached (1·7 nmol/L or lower) men received three oestrogen patches changed twice weekly. The primary outcome, cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, was analysed by modified intention to treat and by therapy at the time of the event to account for treatment crossover in cases of disease progression. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00303784.  Findings:   85 patients were randomly assigned to receive LHRHa and 169 to receive oestrogen patches. All 85 patients started LHRHa, and 168 started oestrogen patches. At 3 months, 70 (93%) of 75 receiving LHRHa and 111 (92%) of 121 receiving oestrogen had achieved castrate testosterone concentrations. After a median follow-up of 19 months (IQR 12-31), 24 cardiovascular events were reported, six events in six (7·1%) men in the LHRHa group (95% CI 2·7-14·9) and 18 events in 17 (10·1%) men in the oestrogen-patch group (6·0-15·6). Nine (50%) of 18 events in the oestrogen group occurred after crossover to LHRHa. Mean 12-month changes in fasting glucose concentrations were 0·33 mmol/L (5·5%) in the LHRHa group and -0·16 mmol/L (-2·4%) in the oestrogen-patch group (p=0·004), and for fasting cholesterol were 0·20 mmol/L (4·1%) and -0·23 mmol/L (-3·3%), respectively (p<0·0001). Other adverse events reported by 6 months included gynaecomastia (15 [19%] of 78 patients in the LHRHa group vs 104 [75%] of 138 in the oestrogen-patch group), hot flushes (44 [56%] vs 35 [25%]), and dermatological problems (10 [13%] vs 58 [42%]).  Interpretation:   Parenteral oestrogen could be a potential alternative to LHRHa in management of prostate cancer if efficacy is confirmed.

Objective:   Because small-volume LN metastases may be missed by standard histopathologic examination, we performed an anatomic mapping study combining molecular and histopathologic LN examination in PCa patients treated with RP and extended PLND (ePLND).  Design, setting, and participants:   A total of 52 patients with intermediate- (n=15) and high-risk (n=37) PCa underwent RP and ePLND without neoadjuvant treatment. ePLND included dissection of the obturator fossa and the external, internal, and common iliac vessels.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   LNs ≥3 mm in diameter were analysed by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) for prostate-specific antigen (PSA) expression and by standard histopathology. Topography of positive LNs was determined descriptively.  Results and limitations:   Of 1469 dissected LNs (median: 27 LNs per patient), 1186 LNs were ≥3 mm. Molecular LN analysis was positive in 127 LNs of 27 patients (52%) including 32 LNs of 12 patients (23%) with histopathologic positive LNs. Molecular examination was negative in 3 of 35 histopathologic positive LNs (9%). Combining both molecular and histopathologic findings, positive LNs were located in the standard PLND field defined by obturator fossa and external iliac vessels in 71%, along the internal iliac vessels in 16%, and along the common iliac vessels in 13%. Of LN-positive patients, 63% had LN metastases outside the standard PLND field. The internal iliac field was involved in 48% and the common iliac field in 37% of node-positive patients. Notably, internal and common iliac vessels were the only positive regions in 7% and 11% of node-positive patients, respectively. A limitation is the small number of patients included.  Conclusions:   These findings underline the enhanced sensitivity of qRT-PCR in comparison with standard histopathology for detection of small-volume LN metastases in PCa patients. Our results support an ePLND including the common iliac vessels, at least up to the ureteral crossing, to optimise nodal staging and to remove LNs potentially harbouring metastases.""","""['Matthias M Heck', 'Margitta Retz', 'Miriam Bandur', 'Marc Souchay', 'Elisabeth Vitzthum', 'Gregor Weirich', 'Martin Mollenhauer', 'Tibor Schuster', 'Michael Autenrieth', 'Hubert Kübler', 'Tobias Maurer', 'Mark Thalgott', 'Kathleen Herkommer', 'Jürgen E Gschwend', 'Roman Nawroth']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['How many prostate cancer-bearing lymph nodes did we miss in the past?', 'Words of wisdom.

Yet, overcoming patient selection forces is a formidable challenge for observational studies comparing treatment groups.  Objective:   To compare patterns of symptom burden and distress in men with localized PCa randomized to radical prostatectomy (RP) or watchful waiting (WW) and followed up longitudinally.  Design, setting, and participants:   The three largest, Swedish, randomization centers for the Scandinavian Prostate Cancer Group-4 trial conducted a longitudinal study to assess symptoms and distress from several psychological and physical domains by mailed questionnaire every 6 mo for 2 yr and then yearly through 8 yr of follow-up.  Intervention:   RP compared with WW.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   A questionnaire was mailed at baseline and then repeatedly during follow-up with questions concerning physical and mental symptoms. Each analysis of quality of life was based on a dichotomization of the outcome (yes vs no) studied in a binomial response, generalized linear mixed model.  Results and limitations:   Of 347 randomized men, 272 completed at least five questionnaires during an 8-yr follow-up period. Almost all men reported that PCa negatively influenced daily activities and relationships. Health-related distress, worry, feeling low, and insomnia were consistently reported by approximately 30-40% in both groups. Men in the RP group consistently reported more leakage, impaired erection and libido, and fewer obstructive voiding symptoms. For men in the WW group, distress related to erectile symptoms increased gradually over time. Symptom burden and distress at baseline was predictive of long-term outlook.  Conclusions:   Cancer negatively influenced daily activities among almost all men in both treatment groups; health-related distress was common. Trade-offs exist between physiologic symptoms, highlighting the importance of tailored treatment decision-making.

Materials and methods:   We identified 34,976 men with prostate cancer who had undergone radical prostatectomy within 12 months of diagnosis from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare data set (1992-2007), and their clinical and demographic parameters were assessed. We measured the Medicare claims for receipt of AST before radical prostatectomy and calculated the annual rates of neoadjuvant AST, which were adjusted for confounding variables using multivariate logistic regression analysis, and compared them with the prevailing published clinical data on the outcomes of neoadjuvant AST, changes in reimbursement, or published data on clinical harm from treatment.  Results:   The use of neoadjuvant AST increased from 7.8% in 1992 to a peak of 17.6% in 1996 and then decreased steadily to 4.6% in 2007. This rate change was significant on multivariate regression analysis, with a single join point in 1996 (P <.001), and corresponded to published data showing improved surgical margin rates and pathologic downstaging in the early 1990s and data showing no improvement in disease recurrence or overall survival beginning in 1997. Changes in reimbursement and evidence of harm from AST were not associated with the decreased use of neoadjuvant AST.  Conclusion:   Using neoadjuvant AST as the model for the nonindicated use of AST, physicians reduced AST use in response to high-level evidence showing a lack of benefit, despite the high reimbursement.

Materials and methods:   A total of 66 white men were included in the present study. All subjects had received LHRH agonist therapy for ≥ 3 months. The BMI was calculated, and the subjects were classified as normal weight (i.e. BMI <25 kg/m(2)), overweight (BMI 25-30 kg/m(2)), or obese (BMI >30 kg/m(2)). The serum testosterone concentration was determined using the highly sensitive isotope dilution-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry technique. The sex hormone-binding globulin level was determined using an immunometric assay, and the free serum testosterone concentration was calculated.  Results:   The median serum testosterone concentration of the patients with a BMI <25 kg/m(2) was 5.5 ng/dL. The patients with a BMI of 25-30 kg/m(2) had a median serum testosterone concentration of 3.8 ng/dL. Those patients with a BMI >30 kg/m(2) had a median concentration of 5.7 ng/dL. No significant difference in the serum testosterone concentrations among the 3 groups was found. The sex hormone-binding globulin levels declined with an increasing BMI. The concentration of free testosterone was significantly greater in the obese men.  Conclusion:   Using an ultrasensitive technique of serum testosterone measurement, the present data have shown that no difference exists in the serum testosterone concentration in the castrate range among normal weight, overweight, and obese patients receiving LHRH agonist therapy for prostate cancer.

Patients and methods:   We analysed prospective data on 1114 patients undergoing TRUS-guided PBx at our institute from January 2007 to August 2010. Patients completed questionnaires based on a 10-point visual analogue pain scale related to the consecutive steps of PBx: probe insertion, application of periprostatic nerve block (PPNB) and the obtaining of PBx cores. The variables of interest were age, prostate volume, DRE findings, number of previous biopsies, probe type and the number of retrieved cores. All variables were correlated to pain scores using multivariate regression analysis.  Results:   At the probe insertion step, end-fire probes were more painful than side-fire probes. The Siemens G50 with metal, short plastic and long plastic needle guides (Siemens, Munich, Germany) had higher pain scores than the B&K probe (Bruel & Kjaer Medical, Copenhagen, Denmark; P = 0.09, 0.008 and 0.003, respectively). For pain at the PPNB application step, all G50(TM) guide subtypes and the Sonoline Prima probe (Siemens) had higher pain scores than the B&K probe, but this only reached statistical significance for the G50(TM) probe with short plastic guide (P = 0.03).

AND WHAT DOES THE STUDY ADD?: Up to 35% of men on active surveillance (AS) for clinically localized prostate cancer will experience biopsy reclassification during follow-up. Currently, annual prostate biopsy is recommended in AS programmes. Multiparametric MRI has shown promise in identifying men at risk for immediate reclassification at the time of entry into AS; however, the MRI characteristics of men already enrolled in AS who may be at low risk for disease reclassification have not been fully described. In the present study, we describe the MRI findings of a cohort of men enrolled within AS, with extended follow-up. Among these men, multiparametric MRI demonstrated excellent specificity (0.974) and negative predictive value (0.897) for the detection of pathological index lesions (determined on serial biopsies). These results suggest that men enrolled in AS with a non-suspicious MRI are unlikely to harbour an index cancerous lesion.  Objective:   To assess the performance of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in identifying pathological-index (path-index) lesions, defined as cancer present in the same prostate sextant in two separate surveillance biopsies, in men followed within an active surveillance (AS) programme for low-risk prostate cancer (CaP) with extended follow-up.  Materials and methods:   A total of 50 men, representing >215 person-years of follow-up in an AS programme, who were referred for prostate MRI were randomly chosen to have their images reviewed by a radiologist with expertise in prostate MRI, who was blinded to biopsy results. Index lesions on MRI were defined as a single suspicious lesion ≥10 mm or >2 lesions in a given prostate sextant. Lesions on MRI were considered suspicious if ≥2 abnormal parameters co-registered anatomically. Path-index lesions were defined as cancer present in a given prostate sextant on two separate biopsy sessions. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated to test the performance of MRI for identifying path-index lesions. Clinical and pathological features were compared between men with and without a MRI-index lesion.  Results:   A total of 31 path-index and 13 MRI-index lesions were detected in 22 and 10 patients, respectively. Multiparametric MRI demonstrated excellent specificity and negative predictive value (0.974 and 0.897, respectively) for the detection of path-index lesions. Sensitivity (0.19) and positive predictive value (0.46) were considerably lower. Patients with an index lesion on MRI were younger and less likely to have met the 'Epstein' criteria for very low-risk CaP. Compared with men without an MRI lesion, a significant increase in biopsy reclassification was noted for men with a MRI lesion (40 vs 12.5%, P = 0.04).  Conclusions:   A non-suspicious MRI was highly correlated with a lack of path-index lesions in an AS population.

This study found no clear association between overall statin use and risk of disease progression, as well as lack of a monotone dose-response relationship between the use of statins, whether it was use before or after prostatectomy, and prostate cancer disease progression.  Objective:   To investigate whether use of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors ('statins'), which have shown broad spectrum anti-cancer properties in laboratory studies, is associated with a reduced risk of recurrence in patients with prostate cancer who undergo radical prostatectomy.  Patients and methods:   All men with incident prostate cancer diagnosed between 2004 and 2005 who subsequently underwent radical prostatectomy by the end of 2005 in the Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC) health plan were identified using KPSC's cancer registry. Subjects were followed for up to 5 years after prostatectomy for (i) biochemical recurrence, defined as a single PSA measurement >0.2 ng/mL, and (ii) clinical disease progression, defined as diagnosis of metastatic disease or prostate-cancer-related death. Information on statin use, demographics, comorbidities, patho-clinical factors and outcomes were ascertained from KPSC's electronic medical records. The effects of statin use prior to and after prostatectomy were both examined using bivariate and multivariate Cox models, adjusting for known prognostic factors. For postoperative statin exposure, a time-dependent Cox model was used.  Results:   A total of 1200 men were included; 37% had preoperative and 56% had postoperative statin use. Neither preoperative nor postoperative statin use was associated with biochemical recurrence (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.00 [0.72-1.39] and 1.05 [0.76-1.46], respectively) or clinical disease progression (HR = 0.63 [0.31-1.27] and 1.20 [0.63-2.30], respectively). No clear dose-response relationship was found for duration of use.  Conclusions:   Statin use may not prevent prostate cancer progression following radical prostatectomy. These findings do not provide support for the pursuit of a prospective clinical trial of statin use as a secondary prevention among surgically treated patients with prostate cancer.""","""['Chun Chao', 'Steven J Jacobsen', 'Lanfang Xu', 'Lauren P Wallner', 'Kimberly R Porter', 'Stephen G Williams']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Use of statins and prostate cancer recurrence among patients treated with radical prostatectomy.', 'Preoperative statin therapy is not associated with biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy: our experience and meta-analysis.', 'Impact of positive surgical margins on prostate-specific antigen failure after radical prostatectomy in adjuvant treatment-naïve patients.', 'Pathological and biochemical outcomes after radical prostatectomy in men with low-risk prostate cancer meeting the Prostate Cancer International: Active Surveillance criteria.', 'Prognostic prediction following radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer using conventional as well as molecular biological approaches.', 'Statin use and the risk of biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer after definitive local therapy: a meta-analysis of eight cohort studies.', 'Statin Use and the Risk of Prostate Cancer Biochemical Recurrence Following Definitive Therapy: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Cohort Studies.', 'The association of statin use and biochemical recurrence after curative treatment for prostate cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Evidence on Statins, Omega-3, and Prostate Cancer: A Narrative Review.', 'Lipoproteins and cancer: The role of HDL-C, LDL-C, and cholesterol-lowering drugs.', ""Using Elevated Cholesterol Synthesis as a Prognostic Marker in Wilms' Tumor: A Bioinformatic Analysis.""]"""

AND WHAT DOES THE STUDY ADD?: Transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsies (TRUSBx) are associated with a spectrum of complications, including most significantly infection, which affects up to 5% of patients. In the most severe cases, infection leads to sepsis, a life-threatening complication. Escherichia coli is the primary responsible pathogen. Although antibiotic prophylaxis with fluoroquinolones is routinely used, there is evidence that the infection rate after TRUSBx is increasing, and this appears to be due to an increasing prevalence of ciprofloxacin-resistant rectal flora. This is the largest prospective clinical trial to date analysing the rectal flora of men undergoing prostate biopsies. We determined the microbial and antibiotic sensitivity profiles from 849 patients. Ciprofloxacin-resistant Gram-negative organisms were identified in the rectal flora of 19.0% of men. Furthermore, fluoroquinolone use within 6 months preceding a TRUSBx and the presence of a prosthetic heart valve were significant predictors of ciprofloxacin resistance on rectal swab. Determining the prevalence of rectal fluoroquinolone resistance has important implications in evaluation of the suitability of prophylactic regimens. Antimicrobial profiles derived from rectal swabs pre-biopsy may prove useful in guiding targeted antibiotic prophylaxis.  Objectives:   To establish the prevalence of ciprofloxacin-resistant bacteria in patients undergoing transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsies (TRUSBx) and to determine whether this predicts subsequent infectious complications. To identify risk factors for harbouring ciprofloxacin-resistant flora.  Patients and methods:   Any patient undergoing a TRUSBx from 2009 to 2011 was eligible for enrolment in this prospective study. Pre-biopsy rectal and urine cultures and post-biopsy urine cultures were obtained and antimicrobial susceptibility was determined. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify independent patient risk factors associated with ciprofloxacin-resistant rectal flora.  Results:   A total of 865 patients underwent TRUSBx, of whom 19.0% were found to have ciprofloxacin-resistant Gram-negative coliforms. Escherichia coli was the most prevalent Gram-negative rectal isolate (80.9%) and accounted for 90.6% of ciprofloxacin resistance. Patient characteristics that conferred an increased risk of harbouring ciprofloxacin-resistant organisms included a history of a heart valve replacement (P < 0.05) and ciprofloxacin use in the past 3 months (P < 0.05). Infectious complications were observed in 3.6% (n = 31) of the patient population and 48% of these patients grew ciprofloxacin-resistant organisms on the pre-biopsy rectal swab (P < 0.001).  Conclusions:   Antimicrobial resistance to ciprofloxacin in the rectal flora was common, particularly in patients with recent ciprofloxacin use and a heart valve replacement. Despite a significant correlation between those patients who developed infections and the detection of ciprofloxacin-resistant organisms, only 9.0% (n = 15) of the total group with ciprofloxacin resistance developed an infectious complication. Future studies will need to evaluate the cost effectiveness and clinical utility of a pre-biopsy rectal culture in targeting antibiotic prophylaxis.""","""['Stephen Taylor', 'Joseph Margolick', 'Zeid Abughosh', 'S Larry Goldenberg', 'Dirk Lange', 'William R Bowie', 'Robert Bell', 'Diane Roscoe', 'Lindsay Machan', 'Peter Black']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Ciprofloxacin resistance in the faecal carriage of patients undergoing transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy.', 'Words of wisdom.

Case description:   A 67-year-old patient with a history of radical prostatectomy came to the emergency department with abdominal pain after a colonoscopy. A few years prior, he had received an artificial urinary sphincter prosthesis because of urinary incontinence. An abdominal CT scan showed a cystic lesion, which was punctured under ultrasonic guidance. The patient was completely incontinent after the intervention. It appeared to have been the pressure balloon of the urinary sphincter prosthesis that was punctured. The pressure balloon was operatively replaced several weeks later. During this procedure, the pressure balloon was placed intravesically instead of in the retropubic space and a reoperation was necessary.

These data are compared with results in a water phantom and with expected values in an infinite water medium. A comparison with reported values from proton therapy and intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is also provided.  Methods:   Monte Carlo simulations in Geant4 were performed using a voxelized phantom described in International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) Publication 110, which reproduces masses and shapes from an adult reference man defined in ICRP Publication 89. Point sources of (60)Co or (192)Ir with photon energy spectra corresponding to those exiting their capsules were placed in the center of the prostate, and equivalent doses per clinical absorbed dose in this target organ were obtained in several radiosensitive organs. Values were corrected to account for clinical circumstances with the source located at various positions with differing dwell times throughout the prostate. This was repeated for a homogeneous water phantom.  Results:   For the nearest organs considered (bladder, rectum, testes, small intestine, and colon), equivalent doses given by (60)Co source were smaller (8%-19%) than from (192)Ir. However, as the distance increases, the more penetrating gamma rays produced by (60)Co deliver higher organ equivalent doses. The overall result is that effective dose per clinical absorbed dose from a (60)Co source (11.1 mSv/Gy) is lower than from a (192)Ir source (13.2 mSv/Gy). On the other hand, equivalent doses were the same in the tissue and the homogeneous water phantom for those soft tissues closer to the prostate than about 30 cm. As the distance increased, the differences of photoelectric effect in water and soft tissue, and appearance of other materials such as air, bone, or lungs, produced variations between both phantoms which were at most 35% in the considered organ equivalent doses. Finally, effective doses per clinical absorbed dose from IMRT and proton therapy were comparable to those from both brachytherapy sources, with brachytherapy being advantageous over external beam radiation therapy for the furthest organs.  Conclusions:   A database of organ equivalent doses when applying HDR brachytherapy to the prostate with either (60)Co or (192)Ir is provided. According to physical considerations, (192)Ir is dosimetrically advantageous over (60)Co sources at large distances, but not in the closest organs. Damage to distant healthy organs per clinical absorbed dose is lower with brachytherapy than with IMRT or protons, although the overall effective dose per Gy given to the prostate seems very similar. Given that there are several possible fractionation schemes, which result in different total amounts of therapeutic absorbed dose, advantage of a radiation treatment (according to equivalent dose to healthy organs) is treatment and facility dependent.""","""['Cristian Candela-Juan', 'Jose Perez-Calatayud', 'Facundo Ballester', 'Mark J Rivard']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Comparison of organ doses for patients undergoing balloon brachytherapy of the breast with HDR 192Ir or electronic sources using monte carlo simulations in a heterogeneous human phantom.', 'Suitability of microDiamond detectors for the determination of absorbed dose to water around high-dose-rate 192 Ir brachytherapy sources.', 'Dosimetric considerations to determine the optimal technique for localized prostate cancer among external photon, proton, or carbon-ion therapy and high-dose-rate or low-dose-rate brachytherapy.', 'The emerging role of high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy as monotherapy for prostate cancer.', 'What is the best way to radiate the prostate in 2016?', 'A comparative assessment of inhomogeneity and finite patient dimension effects in 60Co and 192Ir high-dose-rate brachytherapy.', 'Study of the dosimetric differences between (192)Ir and (60)Co sources of high dose rate brachytherapy for breast interstitial implant.']"""

The method uses an interstitial multielement ultrasound applicator to deliver high-intensity ultrasound energy to tissue in order to achieve thermal coagulation in a target volume.  Methods:   A new temperature feedback control algorithm incorporating a proportional-integral controller is introduced to tackle a multiple-input single-output control problem arising in MRI-controlled interstitial ultrasound cancer therapy.

In this study the magnitude of the ISA effect is assessed in a phantom and in clinical prostate postimplant cases. Results are compared for seed models 6711 and 9011 with 0.8 and 0.5 mm diameters, respectively.  Methods:   A polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) phantom was designed to perform ISA measurements in a simple eight-seed arrangement and at the center of an implant of 36 seeds. Monte Carlo (MC) simulation and experimental measurements using a MOSFET dosimeter were used to measure dose rate and the ISA effect. MC simulations of 15 CT-based postimplant prostate treatment plans were performed to compare the clinical impact of ISA on dose to prostate, urethra, rectum, and the volume enclosed by the 100% isodose, for 6711 and 9011 seed models.  Results:   In the phantom, ISA reduced the dose rate at the MOSFET position by 8.6%-18.3% (6711) and 7.8%-16.7% (9011) depending on the measurement configuration. MOSFET measured dose rates agreed with MC simulation predictions within the MOSFET measurement uncertainty, which ranged from 5.5% to 7.2% depending on the measurement configuration (k = 1, for the mean of four measurements). For 15 clinical implants, the mean ISA effect for 6711 was to reduce prostate D90 by 4.2 Gy (3%), prostate V100 by 0.5 cc (1.4%), urethra D10 by 11.3 Gy (4.4%), rectal D2cc by 5.5 Gy (4.6%), and the 100% isodose volume by 2.3 cc. For the 9011 seed the mean ISA effect reduced prostate D90 by 2.2 Gy (1.6%), prostate V100 by 0.3 cc (0.7%), urethra D10 by 8.0 Gy (3.2%), rectal D2cc by 3.1 Gy (2.7%), and the 100% isodose volume by 1.2 cc. Differences between the MC simulation and TG-43U1 consensus data for the 6711 seed model had a similar impact, reducing mean prostate D90 by 6 Gy (4.2%) and V100 by 0.6 cc (1.8%).  Conclusions:   ISA causes the delivered dose in prostate seed implant brachytherapy to be lower than the dose calculated by TG-43U1. MC simulation of phantom seed arrangements show that dose at a point can be reduced by up to 18% and this has been validated using a MOSFET dosimeter.

For an accurate radiobiological evaluation of the overall treatment, fractionation corrections to each dose distribution must be applied before summing the three-dimensional dose matrix of each plan since the simpler approach of performing the fractionation correction to the total dose-volume histograms, obtained by the arithmetical sum of the different plans, becomes inaccurate for more heterogeneous dose patterns. In this study, the differences between these two fractionation correction methods, named here as exact (corrected before) and approximate (after summation), respectively, are assessed for different cancer types.  Methods:   Prostate, breast, and head and neck (HN) tumor patients were selected to quantify the differences between two fractionation correction methods (the exact vs the approximate). For each cancer type, two different treatment plans were developed using uniform (CRT) and intensity modulated beams (IMRT), respectively. The responses of the target and normal tissue were calculated using the Poisson linear-quadratic-time model and the relative seriality model, respectively. All treatments were radiobiologically evaluated and compared using the complication-free tumor control probability (P+), the biologically effective uniform dose (D) together with common dosimetric criteria.  Results:   For the prostate cancer patient, an underestimation of around 14%-15% in P+ was obtained when the fractionation correction was applied after summation compared to the exact approach due to significant biological and dosimetric variations obtained between the two fractionation correction methods in the involved lymph nodes. For the breast cancer patient, an underestimation of around 3%-4% in the maximum dose in the heart was obtained. Despite the dosimetric differences in this organ, no significant variations were obtained in treatment outcome. For the HN tumor patient, an underestimation of about 5% in treatment outcome was obtained for the CRT plan as a result of an underestimation of the planning target volume control probability by about 10%. An underestimation of about 6% in the complication probability of the right parotid was also obtained. For all the other organs at risk, dosimetric differences of up to 4% were obtained but with no significant impact in the expected clinical outcome. However, for the IMRT plan, an overestimation in P+ of 4.3% was obtained mainly due to an underestimation of the complication probability of the left and right parotids (2.9% and 5.8%, respectively).  Conclusions:   The use of the exact fractionation correction method, which is applying fractionation correction on the separate dose distributions of a multiple phase treatment before their summation was found to have a significant expected clinical impact. For regions of interest that are irradiated with very heterogeneous dose distributions and significantly different doses per fraction in the different treatment phases, the exact fractionation correction method needs to be applied since a significant underestimation of the true patient outcome can be introduced otherwise.""","""['Panayiotis Mavroidis', 'Brigida Costa Ferreira', 'Nikos Papanikolaou', 'Maria do Carmo Lopes']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Response-probability volume histograms and iso-probability of response charts in treatment plan evaluation.', 'Treatment plan comparison between helical tomotherapy and MLC-based IMRT using radiobiological measures.', 'Radiobiologic comparison of helical tomotherapy, intensity modulated radiotherapy, and conformal radiotherapy in treating lung cancer accounting for secondary malignancy risks.', 'The linear-quadratic transformation of dose-volume histograms in fractionated radiotherapy.', 'Radiobiological indices that consider volume: a review.', 'Evaluation of the clinical impact of the differences between planned and delivered dose in prostate cancer radiotherapy based on CT-on-rails IGRT and patient-reported outcome scores.', 'Evaluation of Biological Effective Dose in Gamma Knife Staged Stereotactic Radiosurgery for Large Brain Metastases.', 'Influence of Urethra Sparing on Tumor Control Probability and Normal Tissue Complication Probability in Focal Dose Escalated Hypofractionated Radiotherapy: A Planning Study Based on Histopathology Reference.', 'Voxel based evaluation of sequential radiotherapy treatment plans with different dose fractionation schemes.', 'Dosimetric and Radiobiological Evaluation of Patient Setup Accuracy in Head-and-neck Radiotherapy Using Daily Computed Tomography-on-rails-based Corrections.']"""

The purpose of this work is to develop a clinically practical autodetection algorithm for motion management during VMAT.  Methods:   The expected field-specific segments and the planned fiducial position from the Eclipse (Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, CA) treatment planning system were projected onto the MV images. The fiducials were enhanced by applying a Laplacian of Gaussian filter in the spatial domain for each image, with a blob-shaped object as the impulse response. The search of implanted fiducials was then performed on a region of interest centered on the projection of the fiducial when it was within an open field including the case when it was close to the field edge or partially occluded by the leaves. A universal template formula was proposed for template matching and normalized cross correlation was employed for its simplicity and computational efficiency. The search region for every image was adaptively updated through a prediction model that employed the 3D position of the fiducial estimated from the localized positions in previous images. This prediction model allowed the actual fiducial position to be tracked dynamically and was used to initialize the search region. The artifacts caused by electronic interference during the acquisition were effectively removed. A score map was computed by combining both morphological information and image intensity. The pixel location with the highest score was selected as the detected fiducial position. The sets of cine MV images taken during treatment were analyzed with in-house developed software written in MATLAB (The Mathworks, Inc., Natick, MA). Five prostate patients were analyzed to assess the algorithm performance by measuring their positioning accuracy during treatment.  Results:   The algorithm was able to accurately localize the fiducial position on MV images with success rates of more than 90% per case. The percentage of images in which each fiducial was localized in the studied cases varied between 23% and 65%, with at least one fiducial having been localized between 40% and 95% of the images. This depended mainly on the modulation of the plan and fiducial blockage. The prostate movement in the presented cases varied between 0.8 and 3.5 mm (mean values). The maximum displacement detected among all patients was of 5.7 mm.  Conclusions:   An algorithm for automatic detection of fiducial markers in cine MV images has been developed and tested with five clinical cases. Despite the challenges posed by complex beam aperture shapes, fiducial localization close to the field edge, partial occlusion of fiducials, fast leaf and gantry movement, and inherently low MV image quality, good localization results were achieved in patient images.

Simulated images of ellipsoid and truncated cone geometrical objects were constructed to determine volume calculation accuracy. Simulation results were used to deduce the algorithm-associated error made when calculating transrectal US prostate volumes.  Results:   For imaging without deliberate slice positioning, planimetry reconstruction was mostly accurate while the frustum algorithm underestimated the volume. The discrepancy was mostly due to the end slice reconstruction. For slice positioning that reflected US image acquisition, planimetry overestimated by half the superior slice volume on average while frustum underestimated by half the inferior slice volume.

Methods:   Five prostate and six head and neck plans were modified by means of three error types: (1) both MLC banks are opened, respectively, in opposing directions, resulting in larger fields; (2) both MLC banks are closed, resulting in smaller fields; and (3) both MLC banks are shifted for lateral gantry angles, respectively, in the same direction to simulate the effects of gravity on the leaves. Measurements were evaluated with respect to a gamma-index of 3%/3 mm and 2%/2 mm. Dose in the modified plans was recalculated and the resulting dose volume histograms for target and critical structures were compared to those of the unaltered plans.  Results:   The smallest introduced leaf position deviations which fail the >90% criterion for a gamma-index of 2%/2 mm are: (1) 1 mm; (2) 0.5 mm for prostate and 1.0 mm for head and neck cases; and (3) 3 mm corresponding to the error types, respectively. These errors would lead to significant changes in mean PTV dose and would not be detected with the more commonly used 3%/3 mm gamma-index criterion.  Conclusions:   A stricter gamma-index (2%/2 mm) is necessary in order to detect positional errors of the MLC. Nevertheless, the quality assurance procedure of Rapidarc treatment plans must include a thorough examination of where dose discrepancies occur, and professional judgment is needed when interpreting the gamma-index analysis, since even a >90% passing rate using the 2%/2 mm gamma-index criterion does not guarantee the absence of clinically significance dose deviation.""","""['G Heilemann', 'B Poppe', 'W Laub']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Understanding the impact of RapidArc therapy delivery errors for prostate cancer.', 'Sensitivity of volumetric modulated arc therapy patient specific QA results to multileaf collimator errors and correlation to dose volume histogram based metrics.', 'Biological consequences of MLC calibration errors in IMRT delivery and QA.', 'Implementation of phantom-less IMRT delivery verification using Varian DynaLog files and R/V output.', 'Is it necessary to repeat quality control procedures for head and neck patients?', 'Optimizing the Region for Evaluation of Global Gamma Analysis for Nasopharyngeal Cancer (NPC) Pretreatment IMRT QA by COMPASS: A Retrospective Study.', 'Assessment of Statistical Process Control Based DVH Action Levels for Systematic Multi-Leaf Collimator Errors in Cervical Cancer RapidArc Plans.', 'An Investigation of Multileaf Collimator Performance Dependence on Gantry Angle Using Machine Log Files.', 'Effect of isocenter deviation on volume modulated arc therapy plan results and gamma passing rate in the treatment of cervical cancer.', 'Correlation Between Average Segment Width and Gamma Passing Rate as a Function of MLC Position Error in Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy.']"""

It has also been reported that vitexicarpin can inhibit the growth of various cancer cells. However, there is no report elucidating its effect on human prostate carcinoma cells. The aim of the present study was to examine the apoptotic induction activity of vitexicarpin on PC-3 cells and molecular mechanisms involved. MTT studies showed that vitexicarpin dose-dependently inhibited growth of PC-3 cells with an IC50~28.8 μM. Hoechst 33258 staining further revealed that vitexicarpin induced apoptotic cell death. The effect of vitexicarpin on PC-3 cells apoptosis was tested using prodium iodide (PI)/Annexin V-FITC double staining and flow cytometry. The results indicated that vitexicarpin induction of apoptotic cell death in PC-3 cells was accompanied by cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase. Furthermore, our study demonstrated that vitexicarpin induction of PC-3 cell apoptosis was associated with upregulation of the proapoptotic protein Bax, and downregulation of antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2, release of Cytochrome c from mitochondria and decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential.

However, the associations of these 6 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with PCa has remained tobe clarified in men in Northern China. This study aimed to explore the loci associated with PCa risk in a Northern Chinese population.  Methods:   Blood samples and clinical information of 289 PCa patients and 288 controls from Beijing and Tianjin were collected. All risk SNPs were genotyped using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-high resolution melting curve technology and gene sequencing. Associations between PCa and clinical covariates (age at diagnosis, prostate-specific antigen [PSA], Gleason score, tumor stage, and level of aggressiveness) and frequencies of alleles and genotypes of these SNPs were analyzed using genetic statistics.  Results:   Among the candidate SNPs, 11p15 (rs7127900, A) was associated with PCa risk (P = 0.02, odds ratio [OR] = 1.64, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.09-2.46).

Globally prostate cancer is the second most frequently diagnosed cancer and sixth leading cause of cancer death in men. The present communication makes an attempt to analyze the time trends in incidence for different age groups of the Indian population reported in different Indian registries using relative difference and regression approaches.  Materials and method:   The data published in Cancer Incidence in Five Continents for various Indian registries for different periods and/or publications by the individual registries served as the source materials. Trends were estimated by computing the mean annual percentage change (MAPC) in the incidence rates using the relative difference between two time periods (latest and oldest) and also by estimation of annual percentage change (EAPC) by the Poisson regression model.  Results:   Age adjusted incidence rates (AAR) of prostate cancer for the period 2005-2008 ranged from 0.8 (Manipur state excluding Imphal west) to 10.9 (Delhi) per 105 person-years. Age specific incidence rates (ASIR) increased in all PBCRs especially after 55 years showing a peak incidence at +65 years clearly indicating that prostate cancer is a cancer of the elderly. MAPC in crude incidence rate(CR) ranged from 0.14 (Ahmedabad) to 8.6 (Chennai) . Chennai also recorded the highest MAPC of 5.66 in ASIR in the age group of 65+. Estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) in the AAR ranged from 0.8 to 5.8 among the three registries. Increase in trend was seen in the 5-64 year age group cohort in many registries and in the 35-44 age group in Metropolitan cities such as Delhi and Mumbai.

Three-dimensional conformal external-beam radiation therapy techniques (eg, intensity-modulated radiation therapy, stereotactic body radiation therapy), although they are designed to reduce the amount of normal tissue exposed to high-dose radiation, inevitably increase the amount of normal tissue that is exposed to low-dose radiation, with the potential for resultant changes that may evolve over time. Currently available internal radiation therapy techniques (eg, arterial radioembolization for hepatic malignancies, brachytherapy for prostate cancer and gynecologic cancers) also carry risks of possible injury to adjacent nontargeted tissues. The sensitivity of tissues to radiation exposure varies according to the tissue type but is generally proportional to the rate of cellular division, with rapidly regenerating tissues such as intestinal mucosa being the most radiosensitive. The characteristic response to radiation-induced injury likewise varies according to tissue type, with atrophy predominating in epithelial tissue whereas fibrosis predominates in stromal tissue. Moreover, changes in irradiated tissues evolve over time: In the liver, decreased attenuation at computed tomography and increased signal intensity at T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging reflect hyperemia and edema in the early posttherapeutic period; later, veno-occlusive changes alter the hepatic enhancement pattern; and finally, fibrosis develops in some patients. In the small bowel, wall thickening and mucosal hyperenhancement predominate initially, whereas luminal narrowing is the most prominent feature of chronic enteropathy. Correlation of posttherapeutic images with images used for treatment planning may be helpful when interpreting complex cases.""","""['Katherine E Maturen', 'Mary U Feng', 'Ashish P Wasnik', 'Shadi F Azar', 'Henry D Appelman', 'Isaac R Francis', 'Joel F Platt']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Radiographics""","""['Radiation injury: imaging findings in the chest, abdomen and pelvis after therapeutic radiation.', 'Radiation injury of the small intestine.

Men in the SA were invited to serum PSA determination up to three times with a 4-year interval between each scan and referred to biopsy if the PSA concentration was greater than or equal to 4.0 ng/mL or 3.0 to 3.99 ng/mL with a free/total PSA ratio less than or equal to 16%. Men in the CA received usual care. The analysis covers follow-up to 12 years from randomization for all men. Hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated for incidence and mortality using Cox proportional hazard model. All statistical tests were two-sided.  Results:   PC incidence was 8.8 per 1000 person-years in the SA and 6.6 in the CA (HR = 1.34, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.27 to 1.40). The incidence of advanced PC was lower in the SA vs CA arm (1.2 vs 1.6, respectively; HR = 0.73, 95% CI = 0.64 to 0.82; P < .001). For PC mortality, no statistically significant difference was observed between the SA and CA (HR = 0.85, 95% CI = 0.69 to 1.04) (with intention-to-screen analysis). To avoid one PC death, we needed to invite 1199 men to screening and to detect 25 PCs. We observed no difference in all-cause mortality between trial arms.  Conclusions:   At 12 years, a relatively conservative screening protocol produced a small, non-statistically significant PC-specific mortality reduction in the Finnish trial, at the cost of moderate overdiagnosis.""","""['Tuomas P Kilpeläinen', 'Teuvo L Tammela', 'Nea Malila', 'Matti Hakama', 'Henrikki Santti', 'Liisa Määttänen', 'Ulf-Håkan Stenman', 'Paula Kujala', 'Anssi Auvinen']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Natl Cancer Inst""","""['The Finnish prostate cancer screening trial: analyses on the screening failures.', 'Disease-specific survival of men with prostate cancer detected during the screening interval: results of the European randomized study of screening for prostate cancer-Rotterdam after 11 years of follow-up.', 'Histological inflammation and risk of subsequent prostate cancer among men with initially elevated serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) concentration in the Finnish prostate cancer screening trial.', 'Detection of prostate cancer: the impact of the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC).', 'Landmarks in prostate cancer screening.', 'Knowledge and Attitudes towards Prostate Cancer and Screening among Males in Limpopo Province, South Africa.', 'Prostate cancer incidence in men with prostate-specific antigen below 3\xa0ng/mL: The Finnish Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer.', 'Inverse Association between Statin Use and Cancer Mortality Relates to Cholesterol Level.', 'Results from 22 years of Followup in the Göteborg Randomized Population-Based Prostate Cancer Screening Trial.', 'Outcomes of Screening for Prostate Cancer Among Men Who Use Statins.']"""

Our study was conducted to assess the value of bone scan for pre-treatment staging of asymptomatic treatment-naïve patients with prostate cancer.  Methods:   A total of 203 consecutive asymptomatic and treatment-naïve patients with prostate cancer (age: 67.6±6.4 years) who were referred to our department for whole body bone scintigraphy were enrolled in the study. Three hours after intravenous injection of 20mCi (99m)Tc-MDP, all patients underwent whole body bone scanning using a single head gamma camera. The planar images were supplemented with SPECT as needed for questionable abnormalities or those having uncertain location on planar images.  Results:   The mean serum PSA levels, serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and Gleason score (GS) were 42.41±37.1ng/ml, 223.9±129.9IU/L and 6.7±1.1, respectively. A total of 55 cases (27.1%) out of 203 patients had bone metastases. The univariate analysis showed that serum PSA levels, GS and ALP were all significant predictors of bone metastases. However, only serum PSA and ALP levels were found to be independent predictors of bone metastasis in the multivariate logistic regression analysis. The combination of PSA and ALP (in which patients with either elevated PSA [>20ng/ml] or elevated ALP were considered as positive) had the best screening value, with 98.2% sensitivity and 48.6% specificity.  Conclusion:   Serum ALP screening can be employed as a tool to detect the subgroup of patients who are at high risk of bone metastases, while having a PSA of <20ng/ml. The combination of PSA and ALP can be used to improve predictability of bone metastasis in newly diagnosed patients with prostate cancer, without affecting staging accuracy.""","""['M Moslehi', 'M Cheki', 'M Salehi-Marzijarani', 'T Amuchastegui', 'A Gholamrezanezhad']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Rev Esp Med Nucl Imagen Mol""","""['Is bone scintigraphy necessary in initial staging of prostate cancer patients?', 'Prediction of bone metastases by combination of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase, alkaline phosphatase and prostate specific antigen in patients with prostate cancer.', 'Implications of serum bone turnover markers in prostate cancer patients with bone metastasis.', 'Capromab Pendetide imaging of prostate cancer.', 'Prostatic specific antigen and bone scan in the diagnosis and follow-up of prostate cancer.

Methods and materials:   Forty patients with prostate cancer were randomized and treated with either loose seeds or loose ""coated"" seeds. Implants were preplanned using transrectal ultrasound and performed using preloaded needles containing either standard or coated iodine-125 seeds according to randomization. Pelvic X-rays and CT were performed on Days 0 and 30 and a pelvic magnetic resonance scan on Day 30. Cranial-caudal displacement relative to the center of mass (COM) of the seed cloud of the six most peripheral basal and apical seeds was determined from Day 0 and 30 CT scans using custom software. Day 30 magnetic resonance-CT fusion was performed using a seed-to-seed match for soft tissue contouring on MRI.  Results:   The mean displacement for the six basal seeds was 0.32 cm (standard deviation [SD], 0.25 cm) and 0.33 cm (SD, 0.27 cm) toward the COM for the regular and coated seeds, respectively (p = 0.35). For the apical seeds, mean displacement was 0.31 cm (SD, 0.35 cm) and 0.43 cm (SD, 0.26 cm) (p = 0.003) toward the COM.

Method:   A total of 60 men with nonmetastatic prostate cancer formed two groups: (a) ADT-RTH (n = 28) and (b) RTH only (n = 32). The ADT-RTH group was further subdivided between men who received long-term ADT (n = 17) and short-term ADT (n = 11). All participants were assessed prior to ADT initiation, and at seven additional times over a period of 16 months using semistructured interviews and self-report scales.  Results:   The prevalence of depressive disorders ranged from 5.5% to 23.0% over the study period. The introduction of ADT was associated with increases in depressive symptoms for some measures but these differences were not significant. Likewise, withdrawal of ADT was associated with consistent decreases in depressive symptoms, but none of these differences was significant. The small sample size may have limited the statistical power to detect those differences. However, calculations of effect sizes revealed that most of them were of a small magnitude.  Conclusions:   To our knowledge, this is the first controlled study that investigated the possible role of ADT in the development of depression using prostate cancer patients who were not receiving ADT as controls.

Material and methods:   Two prospective trials accrued 171 prostate cancer patients from August 2006 to September 2007. Low-risk patients received 78 cobalt gray equivalent (CGE) in 39 fractions and intermediate-risk patients received 78-82 CGE. Median follow-up was five years. The International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and GU toxicities (per CTCAE v3.0 and v4.0) were documented prospectively.  Results:   Five transient GU events were scored Gr 3 per CTCAE v4.0, for a cumulative late GU toxicity rate of 2.9% at five years. There were no Gr 4 or 5 events. On multivariate analysis (MVA), the only factor predictive of Gr 2 + GU toxicity was pretreatment GU symptom management (p = 0.0058). Patients with pretreatment IPSS of 15-25 had a decline (clinical improvement) in median IPSS from 18 before treatment to 10 at their 60-month follow-up. At last follow-up, 18 (54.5%) patients had a > 5-point decline, 14 (42.5%) remained stable, and two patients (3%) had a > 5-point rise (deterioration) in IPSS. Patients with IPSS < 15 had a stable median IPSS of 6 before treatment and at 60 months.  Conclusion:   Urologic toxicity at five years with image-guided PT has been uncommon and transient. Patients with pretreatment IPSS of < 15 had stable urinary function five years after PT, but patients with 15-25 showed substantial improvement (decline) in median IPSS, a finding not explained by initiation or dose adjustment of alpha blockers.

With advances in immunosuppression, the short-term and long-term outcome has improved significantly. Subsequently, urologists are encountering more transplant recipients with genitourinary malignancies, and therefore urologists are becoming increasingly compelled to offer curative treatment options.  Materials and methods:   We present modifications to facilitate E-RARP in these patients that include modified trocar arrangement, delayed bladder neck transection, utilizing the robotic Hem-o-lok applier, and posterior reconstruction of the anastomosis using a barbed V-loc suture. A 68-year-old male with a history of polycystic kidney disease, end-stage renal failure, and an allograft renal transplantation in the right iliac fossa, presented with T1c, Gleason 3+4 prostate cancer. He had a preoperative PSA of 6.93ng/mL, ASA score of 3, and a BMI of 26kg/m2. Follow-up for metastasis (MRI and bone scan) was negative. E-RARP was performed via the extraperitoneal approach using a 5-port 2-arm approach at an insufflation pressure of 10 mm Hg.  Results:   The radical prostatectomy was successfully performed. Ureterovesical anastomosis was completed, and total console time was 130 minutes, with an estimated blood loss of 125mL. Final pathology was T2bNx, Gleason 3+4 with negative surgical margins. The patient was discharged with no change in serum creatinine or GFR. The catheter was removed on POD 10 with no intraoperative or immediate postoperative complications.

These cells showed highly adhesive morphology with extensive cell spreading which is due to the formation of focal adhesions and well organized actin-stress fibers. MMP9 knockdown blocks invadopodia formation and matrix degradation activity as well. However, CD44 knockdown PC3 cells failed to develop focal adhesions and stress fibers; hence these cells make unstable adhesions. A part of the reason for these changes could be caused by silencing of CD44v6 as well. Immunostaining of prostate tissue microarray sections illustrated significantly lower levels of CD44v6 in adenocarcinoma than normal tissue.

A semi-LASER sequence was used with an echo time of 144 ms and optimized interpulse timing for a spectral citrate shape with high signal intensity. An LCModel basis set was developed for fitting choline, creatine, spermine, citrate, and lactate and was used to fit all spectra in tumor-containing voxels. For patients without detectable lactate, the minimal detectable lactate concentration was determined by adding in all spectra of tumor tissue a simulated lactate signal. The amplitude of the simulated lactate signal was iteratively decreased until its fit reached a Cramér Rao lower bound >20%, which was then set as the patient-specific detection limit.  Results:   In none of the patients a convincing lactate signal was found.

In this study, we explored the pro-oxidant property of 3,9-dihydroxy-2-prenylcoumestan (psoralidin [pso]), a dietary agent, on CaP (PC-3 and C4-2B) cells. Pso greatly induced ROS generation (more than 20-fold) that resulted in the growth inhibition of CaP cells. Overexpression of anti-oxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), SOD2, and catalase, or pretreatment with the pharmacological inhibitor N-acetylcysteine (NAC) significantly attenuated both pso-mediated ROS generation and pso-mediated growth inhibition in CaP cells. Furthermore, pso administration significantly inhibited the migratory and invasive property of CaP cells by decreasing the transcription of β-catenin, and slug, which promote epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and by concurrently inducing E-cadherin expression in CaP cells. Pso-induced ROS generation in CaP cells resulted in loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, cytochrome-c release, and activation of caspase-3 and -9 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), which led to apoptosis. On the other hand, overexpression of anti-oxidants rescued pso-mediated effects on CaP cells.

Moreover, to test whether Tau protein expressed in the cancerous prostate tissue is phosphorylated. Thirty patients who received at least three cycles docetaxel for metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer were included into the trial. The patients' formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded prostate tissue specimens were retrospectively obtained from the pathology department archives of Ege University School of Medicine. The expression status of BubR1 protein was defined by immunohistochemical (IHC) using the anti-BubR1 antibody. The expression status of Tau protein was defined by IHC using the two types of Tau antibodies: anti-Tau-1 antibody (that recognizes Tau only in its dephosphorylated form) and anti-PHF-Tau antibody (that recognizes all isoforms of human Tau proteins independent of its phosphorylation status). The BubR1 and Tau were overexpressed in about 63 and 23 % of the study group, respectively. Tau overexpression was significantly associated with lower Gleason score. There was no significant association between the expression levels of BubR1 and Tau proteins, and docetaxel response. Reduced BubR1 expression was strongly associated with longer survival (P = 0.008), whereas Tau expression status did not effect survival. Moreover, the Tau expression of cancerous prostate tissue was highly dephosphorylated. In this clinicopathological study, our findings did not confirm the preclinical observations that low BubR1 and Tau expression confer selective sensitivity to microtubulisin drugs. Our data imply that reduced BubR1 expression was a predictor for longer OS, and the possibility that high Tau expression may be involved in better prognosis due to its relationship to the Gleason score.

In a recently updated mortality study, mortality of prostate and stomach cancer increased with increasing levels of cumulative exposure estimated with this JEM (trend p values = 0.003 and 0.04, respectively). Capacitor manufacturing began with winding bales of foil and paper film, which were placed in a metal capacitor box (pre-assembly), and placed in a vacuum chamber for flood-filling (impregnation) with dielectric fluid (PCBs). Capacitors dripping with PCB residues were then transported to sealing stations where ports were soldered shut before degreasing, leak testing, and painting. Using a systematic approach, all 509 unique jobs identified in the work histories were rated by predetermined process- and plant-specific exposure determinants; then categorized based on the jobs' similarities (combination of exposure determinants) into 35 job exposure categories. The job exposure categories were ranked followed by a qualitative PCB exposure rating (baseline, low, medium, and high) for inhalation and dermal intensity. Category differences in other chemical exposures (solvents, etc.) prevented further combining of categories. The mean of all available PCB concentrations (1975 and 1977) for jobs within each intensity rating was regarded as a representative value for that intensity level. Inhalation (in microgram per cubic milligram) and dermal (unitless) exposures were regarded as equally important. Intensity was frequency adjusted for jobs with continuous or intermittent PCB exposures. Era-modifying factors were applied to the earlier time periods (1946-1974) because exposures were considered to have been greater than in later eras (1975-1977). Such interpolations, extrapolations, and modifying factors may introduce non-differential misclassification; however, we do believe our rigorous method minimized misclassification, as shown by the significant exposure-response trends in the epidemiologic analysis.""","""['Nancy B Hopf', 'Avima M Ruder', 'Martha A Waters']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Environ Sci Pollut Res Int""","""['Mortality among 24,865 workers exposed to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in three electrical capacitor manufacturing plants: a ten-year update.', 'Evaluation of cumulative PCB exposure estimated by a job exposure matrix versus PCB serum concentrations.', 'Development of a retrospective job exposure matrix for PCB-exposed workers in capacitor manufacturing.', 'Cumulative exposure estimates for polychlorinated biphenyls using a job-exposure matrix.', 'Do polychlorinated biphenyls cause cancer?

We propose a novel registration method that uses a patient-specific biomechanical model acquired using magnetic resonance elastography to deform the in vivo volume and match it to the surface of the ex vivo specimen. The forces that drive the deformations are derived from a region-based energy, with the elastic potential used for regularization.

High quality treatment plans maximally radiate the targets while minimally radiating healthy organs at risk. In order to judge plan quality and safety, segmentations of the targets and organs at risk are created, and the amount of radiation that will be delivered to each structure is estimated prior to treatment. If the targets or organs at risk are mislabelled, or the segmentations are of poor quality, the safety of the radiation doses will be erroneously reviewed and an unsafe plan could proceed. We propose a technique to automatically label groups of segmentations of different structures from a radiation therapy plan for the joint purposes of providing quality assurance and data mining. Given one or more segmentations and an associated image we seek to assign medically meaningful labels to each segmentation and report the confidence of that label. Our method uses random forests to learn joint distributions over the training features, and then exploits a set of learned potential group configurations to build a conditional random field (CRF) that ensures the assignment of labels is consistent across the group of segmentations. The CRF is then solved via a constrained assignment problem. We validate our method on 1574 plans, consisting of 17[Formula: see text] 579 segmentations, demonstrating an overall classification accuracy of 91.58%.

The genetic polymorphism of CYP1A1 at the site of MspI (CYP1A1 MspI) has been implicated in prostate cancer risk, but the results of individual studies remain conflicting and inconclusive. The aim of this meta-analysis was to investigate the association of CYP1A1 MspI polymorphism with prostate cancer risk more precisely. We performed a comprehensive search of the PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure databases from their inception up to September 20, 2012 for relevant publications. The pooled odds ratios with the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated to assess the association of CYP1A1 MspI polymorphism with prostate cancer risk. In addition, stratified analyses by ethnicity and sensitivity analyses were conducted for further estimation. Sixteen eligible publications with 6,411 subjects were finally included into the meta-analysis after checking the retrieved papers. Overall, meta-analysis of total studies suggested that individuals carrying the TC genotype and a combined C genotype (CC + TC) were more susceptible to prostate cancer (OR(TC vs. TT) = 1.33, 95% CI 1.10-1.61, P(OR) = 0.004; OR(CC+TC vs. TT) = 1.27, 95% CI 1.05-1.55, P(OR) = 0.016).

A simple, widely used approach to generating multivalent cancer vaccines is to load tumor whole cell lysates into dendritic cells (DCs). Current DC vaccine manufacturing processes require co-incubation of tumor lysate antigens with immature DCs and their subsequent maturation. We compared electroloading of tumor cell lysates directly into mature DCs with the traditional method of lysate co-incubation with immature DCs. Electroloaded mature DCs were more potent in vitro, as judged by their ability to elicit significantly (p < 0.05) greater expansion of peptide antigen-specific CD8(+) T cells, than either lysate-electroloaded immature DCs or lysate-co-incubated immature DCs, both of which must be subsequently matured. Expanded CD8(+) T cells were functional as judged by their ability to produce IFN-γ upon antigen-specific re-stimulation.

Although it is known that finasteride treatment suppresses serum levels of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and its distal metabolite, 5α-androstane-3α,17β-diol glucuronide (3α-diol G), and increases serum testosterone (T) levels, little is known about its effect on other precursors and metabolites of DHT, as well as on the relationship of these androgens to prostate specific antigen (PSA), a marker of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia. The present study provides new data on the effect of finasteride on precursors and metabolites of DHT. Fifty-three men, ages 57-79 years, with elevated PSA levels (>4ng/ml), were randomized to treatment with finasteride (5mg/day) or observation (controls) for 12 months. Blood samples were obtained at baseline, 1, 3, 6 and 12 months for measurement of PSA, androstenedione (A), T, DHT, 3α-diol G, androsterone glucuronide (ADT G) and DHT sulfate (DHT S) in serum by validated, highly specific radioimmunoassays. Statistical analysis was carried out using mixed model ANOVA and t-tests. In the control group, PSA and androgen levels were unchanged throughout the 12 months of treatment. In the finasteride group, PSA, DHT, DHT S, 3α-diol G and ADT G decreased from baseline to 1 month by 23.2%, 78.7%, 71.0%, 75.7% and 43.0%, respectively. The change in PSA decreased further to 46.1% and 55.1% at 3 and 12 months of treatment, respectively, whereas the decrease in androgens observed at 1 month did not change by more than 6.9% for DHT, DHT S and 3α-diol G in the subsequent months of sampling. However, the decline in ADT G was only 22.2% at month 3, and remained essentially at this level after that time. In contrast, T and A increased significantly from baseline, and the increase in A of approximately 34.5% was about 1.9 times the increase in T (approximately 18.3%). The present data suggest that either 3α-diol G or DHT S may serve as a potential diagnostic marker of intraprostatic 5α-reductase activity during treatment of patients with 5α-reductase inhibitors.""","""['Frank Z Stanczyk', 'Colleen G Azen', 'Malcolm C Pike']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Steroid Biochem Mol Biol""","""['Re: effect of finasteride on serum levels of androstenedione, testosterone and their 5α-reduced metabolites in men at risk for prostate cancer.', 'Response to commentary.', 'Associations of serum sex steroid hormone and 5α-androstane-3α,17β-diol glucuronide concentrations with prostate cancer risk among men treated with finasteride.', 'Dexamethasone suppressibility and adrenal and ovarian venous effluents of 5α-reduced C19 conjugates in hyperandrogenic women.', 'MK-386, an inhibitor of 5alpha-reductase type 1, reduces dihydrotestosterone concentrations in serum and sebum without affecting dihydrotestosterone concentrations in semen.', 'Androgen glucuronides analysis by liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry: could it raise new perspectives in the diagnostic field of hormone-dependent malignancies?', 'Dihydrotestosterone and the concept of 5alpha-reductase inhibition in human benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'Progesterone and Breast Cancer.', 'Protective effects of finasteride against testosterone-induced calcium oxalate crystallization and crystal-cell adhesion.', ""Circulating androgens and postmenopausal ovarian cancer risk in the Women's Health Initiative Observational Study."", 'Recent Advances in Drug Design and Drug Discovery for Androgen- Dependent Diseases.', 'Assay reproducibility of serum androgen measurements using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.']"""

Methods and materials:   We retrospectively analyzed 52 consecutively accrued patients undergoing salvage HDRB between 1998 and 2009 for locally recurrent prostate cancer after previous definitive RT. After pathologic confirmation of locally recurrent disease, patients received 36 Gy in 6 fractions. Twenty-four patients received neoadjuvant hormonal therapy before salvage, and no patients received adjuvant hormonal therapy. Determination of biochemical failure after salvage HDRB was based on the Phoenix definition. Overall survival (OS) and bF distributions were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate analyses were performed to identify predictors of biochemical control. Acute and late genitourinary (GU) and gastrointestinal (GI) toxicities, based on Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 4), were documented.  Results:   Median follow-up after salvage HDRB was 59.6 months. The 5-year OS estimate was 92% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 80%-97%) with median survival not yet reached. Five-year biochemical control after salvage was 51% (95% CI: 34%-66%). Median PSA nadir postsalvage was 0.1 (range: 0-7.2) reached at a median of 10.2 months after completing HDRB. As for complications, acute and late grade 3 GU toxicities were observed in only 2% and 2%, respectively. No grade 2 or higher acute GI events and 4% grade 2 GI late events were observed. On univariate analysis, disease-free interval after initial definitive RT (P=.07), percent of positive cores at the time of diagnosis (P=.08), interval from first recurrence to salvage HDRB (P=.09), and pre-HDRB prostate-specific antigen (P=.07) were each of borderline significance in predicting biochemical control after salvage HDRB.

Methods and materials:   468 patients (23.6%) on RTOG 94-08 had sufficient tissue for Ki67-SI analysis. The median follow-up time was 7.9 years. Ki67-SI was determined by immunohistochemistry and quantified manually and by image analysis. Correlative analysis versus clinical outcome was performed using the third quartile (≥Q3) cutpoint. A proportional hazards multivariable analysis (MVA) dichotomized covariates in accordance with trial stratification and randomization criteria.  Results:   In MVAs adjusted for all treatment covariates, high Ki67-SI (≥Q3) was correlated with increased DSM (hazard ratio [HR] 2.48, P=.03), DM (HR 3.5, P=.002), and BF (HR 3.55, P<.0001).

Eligibility criteria included histologically proven prostate adenocarcinoma, age 50-80 yr, stage T1/T2, prostate-specific antigen level (PSA) <15 ng/ml, Gleason score (GS) ≤ 3+3 (GS ≤ 3+4 if aged >65 yr), and percent positive biopsy cores (PPC) ≤ 50%.  Intervention:   Patients were assessed by serum PSA level, and digital rectal examination at 3-mo intervals in year 1, 4-mo intervals in year 2, and at 6-mo intervals thereafter. Transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy was performed after 18-24 mo and every 2 yr thereafter.

AND WHAT DOES THE STUDY ADD?: The recently published Prostate Cancer Intervention versus Observation Trial (PIVOT) did not identify differences in prostate cancer-specific mortality or all-cause mortality among patients with low-risk disease managed conservatively vs those managed definitively; however, recently published data suggest that older men may harbour more aggressive disease than is identified at biopsy owing to sampling error and undergrading. Whether older men with apparent low-risk disease are placed at risk of prostate cancer-specific mortality when managed conservatively remains unknown. The study used population-level data to show that non-curative approaches for older men with low-risk prostate cancer do result in an increased risk of prostate cancer-specific mortality. Differences between our study and the PIVOT trial include the fact that we included a larger sample size, analysed the data using an 'as-treated' approach, and included a healthier cohort of men as evinced by lower 4-year all-cause mortality estimates in our study than in the PIVOT. Our results suggest that older men with apparent low-risk prostate cancer are at risk of undergrading, which probably explains the differences in prostate cancer-specific mortality observed between men managed conservatively vs those managed definitively. Our study suggests that alternative approaches to excluding occult, high grade prostate cancer are needed in such men.  Objective:   To evaluate whether older age in men with low-risk prostate cancer increases the risk of prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM) when non-curative approaches are selected as initial management.  Patients and methods:   The study cohort consisted of 27 969 men, with a median age of 67 years, with prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-detected, low-risk prostate cancer (clinical category T1c, Gleason score ≤6, and PSA ≤10) identified by the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results programme between 2004 and 2007. Fine and Gray's competing risk regression analysis was used to evaluate whether management with non-curative vs curative therapy was associated with an increased risk of PCSM after adjusting for PSA level, age at diagnosis and year of diagnosis.  Results:   After a median follow-up of 2.75 years, 1121 men died, 60 (5.4%) from prostate cancer. Both older age (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR] 1.05; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02-1.08; P < 0.001) and non-curative treatment (AHR 3.34; 95% CI 1.97-5.67; P < 0.001) were significantly associated with an increased risk of PCSM. Men > the median age experienced increased estimates of PCSM when treated with non-curative as opposed to curative intent (P < 0.001); this finding was not seen in men ≤ the median age (P = 0.17).  Conclusion:   Pending prospective validation, our study suggests that non-curative approaches for older men with 'low-risk' prostate cancer result in an increased risk of PCSM, suggesting the need for alternative approaches to exclude occult, high grade prostate cancer in these men.""","""['Ayal A Aizer', 'Ming-Hui Chen', 'Jona Hattangadi', ""Anthony V D'Amico""]""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['The age old question: who benefits from prostate cancer treatment?', 'Commentary on ""initial management of prostate-specific antigen-detected, low-risk prostate cancer and the risk of death from prostate cancer.""

We aimed to determine whether exposure to warfarin is also associated with a reduced risk of prostate cancer death.  Methods:   A nested case-control study was conducted within a population-based cohort of 10,012 men aged ≥50 years with newly diagnosed prostate cancer between 1985 and 2002 and with no history of cancer since 1970 using the linked records of Saskatchewan Health and Saskatchewan Cancer Agency registry. We identified 2,309 cases who died of prostate cancer during follow-up. For each case, one control alive at the time of the case's death and matched for length of follow-up (±6 months) was randomly selected. Prescription counts were used to define warfarin exposure. Multivariate conditional logistic regression analysis was used to calculate the adjusted incidence rates of prostate cancer death in relation to warfarin use while adjusting for confounding by age, year of prostate cancer diagnosis, clinical stage and grade of cancer at diagnosis, Chronic Disease Score, and use of warfarin before diagnosis.  Results:   Ever use of warfarin following a diagnosis of prostate cancer was associated with an adjusted rate ratio of 1.44 (95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.33-1.84) for prostate cancer death.

Methods:   One hundred and seventy-five patients who underwent radical prostatectomy were included. Pre-operative MRI performed at 1.5 T (n = 71) or 3 T (n = 104), with (n = 58) or without (n = 117) an endorectal coil were independently interpreted by two radiologists. A five-point subjective suspicion score (SSS) was assigned to all focal abnormalities (FAs). MR findings were then compared with whole-mount sections.  Results:   Readers identified 192-214/362 cancers, with 130-155 false positives.

Conclusions:   Detection rates were significantly influenced by tumour characteristics, but neither by field strength nor coils used for imaging. The SSS significantly stratified the risk of malignancy of FAs and aggressiveness of detected tumours.

We present a comprehensive report on the trends in cancer incidence and mortality in Japan using the most recent population-based data.  Methods:   National cancer mortality data between 1958 and 2011 were obtained from published vital statistics. Cancer incidence data between 1985 and 2007 were obtained from high-quality population-based cancer registries of four prefectures (Miyagi, Yamagata, Fukui and Nagasaki). Joinpoint regression analysis was performed to examine the trends in age-standardized rates of cancer incidence and mortality.  Results:   All-cancer mortality decreased from the mid-1990s, with an annual percent change of -1.3% (95% confidence interval: -1.4, -1.3), while all-cancer incidence continually increased from 1985, with an annual percent change of 0.7% (95% confidence interval: 0.6, 0.8). Major cancer sites, particularly the liver, colorectum and lung (males), showed a pattern of increasing incidence and mortality rates until the mid-1990s, stabilizing or decreasing thereafter. Stomach cancer showed a long-term decreasing trend for both incidence and mortality, while female breast cancer showed a continuously increasing trend. The incidence of prostate cancer, particularly at the localized stage, increased rapidly between 2000 and 2003, while that of mortality decreased from 2004. No changes were detected in the incidence or mortality for colorectal, female breast or cervical cancers after the establishment of national screening programs for these cancers.

The EP3 antagonist L798106 and EP3 knockdown increased AR expression and cell proliferation, whereas the EP3 agonist sulprostone decreased them, indicating that EP3 affects AR expression. Additionally, EP3 (PTGER3) transcript levels were significantly decreased in human prostate cancer tissues compared with those in normal human prostate tissues, suggesting that EP3 is important to prostate carcinogenesis. Decreased EP3 expression was also seen in castration-resistant subtype CxR cells compared with parental LNCaP cells. Finally, we found that aspirin and EP3 modulators affected prostate cancer cell growth. Taken together, aspirin suppressed LNCaP cell proliferation via EP3 signaling activation; EP3 downregulation contributed to prostate carcinogenesis and to progression from androgen-dependent prostate cancer to castration-resistant prostate cancer by regulating AR expression.

However, the molecular consequences of tumor-associated BAF57 expression have remained undefined in advanced disease such as castration-resistant prostate cancer and/or metastasis.  Experimental design:   Clinical human specimens of primary and metastatic prostate cancer were immunohistochemically examined for tumor-grade association of BAF57 expression. Global gene expression analyses were conducted in models mimicking tumor-associated BAF57 expression. Aberrant BAF57-dependent gene expression changes, bypass of androgen-mediated signaling, and chromatin-specific SWI/SNF complex alterations with respect to cytoskeletal remodelers such as integrins were validated. Cell migration assays were used to profile the biologic phenotypes conferred under conditions simulating tumor-derived BAF57 expression.  Results:   Immunohistochemical quantitation of primary human specimens revealed that BAF57 was significantly and aberrantly elevated as a function of tumor grade. Critically, gene expression analyses showed that BAF57 deregulation circumvented androgen-mediated signaling, elicited α2 integrin upregulation, and altered other SWI/SNF complex components at the α2 integrin locus. BAF57-dependent α2 integrin induction conferred a prometastatic migratory advantage, which was attenuated by anti-α2 integrin antibody blockade. Furthermore, BAF57 was found to be markedly upregulated in human prostate cancer metastases of the lung, lymph node, and dura.  Conclusion:   The findings herein, identifying tumor-associated BAF57 perturbation as a means to bypass androgen-signaling events that facilitate novel prometastatic phenotypes, link BAF57 upregulation to tumor dissemination.

Thus, preventing or treating antiandrogen resistance is a major clinical challenge. We identified a novel antiandrogen, Compound 30, and compared its efficacy with MDV3100. We found that Compound 30 inhibits androgen receptor (AR) activity in LNCaP cells, C4-2 cells, as well as MDV3100-resistant cell lines. Compared with MDV3100, Compound 30 treatment induces greater reduction in AR, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and AR transcriptional activity, and prevents AR nuclear translocation in AR-sensitive LNCaP cells. Compound 30 has antiproliferative effects in LNCaP cells, in castrate-resistant C4-2 cells, and those resistant to MDV3100. Compound 30 was equally as effective as MDV3100 in reducing tumor volume and PSA in vivo. More importantly, Compound 30 is effective at inhibiting AR activity in MDV3100-resistant cell lines and significantly prevented tumor growth and PSA increases in mice bearing MDV3100-resistant xenografts. Together, our data show that Compound 30 strongly inhibited AR activity and suppressed castration-resistant LNCaP growth as well as MDV3100-resistant cell growth in vitro and in vivo.

However, recent evidence suggests that some advanced prostate cancers escape ADT by using signaling programs and growth factors that bypass canonical AR ligand-mediated mechanisms. We used an in vitro high-throughput RNA interference (RNAi) screen to identify pathways in androgen-dependent prostate cancer cell lines whose loss-of-function promotes androgen ligand-independent growth. We identified 40 genes where knockdown promoted proliferation of both LNCaP and VCaP prostate cancer cells in the absence of androgen. Of these, 14 were downregulated in primary and metastatic prostate cancer, including two subunits of the protein phosphatase 2 (PP2A) holoenzyme complex: PPP2R1A, a structural subunit with known tumor-suppressor properties in several tumor types; and PPP2R2C, a PP2A substrate-binding regulatory subunit that has not been previously identified as a tumor suppressor. We show that loss of PPP2R2C promotes androgen ligand depletion-resistant prostate cancer growth without altering AR expression or canonical AR-regulated gene expression. Furthermore, cell proliferation induced by PPP2R2C loss was not inhibited by the AR antagonist MDV3100, indicating that PPP2R2C loss may promote growth independently of known AR-mediated transcriptional programs. Immunohistochemical analysis of PPP2R2C protein levels in primary prostate tumors determined that low PPP2R2C expression significantly associated with an increased likelihood of cancer recurrence and cancer-specific mortality.

Methods:   A comprehensive search was performed for English articles published before May 2012 that fulfilled the following criteria: patients had histopathologically proved prostate cancer; diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) was performed for the detection of prostate cancer, and data for calculating sensitivity and specificity were included. Methodological quality was assessed by using the quality assessment of diagnostic studies instrument. Publication bias analysis, homogeneity, inconsistency index, and threshold effect were performed by STATA version 12.  Results:   Of 119 eligible studies, 12 with 1637 malignant and 4803 benign lesions were included. There was notable heterogeneity beyond threshold effect and publication bias. The sensitivity and specificity with 95% confidence interval (CI) estimates of DWI on a per-lesion basis were 77% (CI, 0.76-0.84) and 84% (CI, 0.78-0.89), respectively, and the area under the curve of summary receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.88 (CI, 0.85-0.90). The overall positive and negative likelihood ratios with 95% CI were 4.93 (3.39-7.17) and 0.278 (0.19-0.39), respectively.

Two treatment approaches were investigated; a conventional approach with a uniform radiation dose to the target volume and an intraprostatic lesion (IPL) boosted approach with an increased dose to a subvolume of the prostate. The impact on plan quality of optimizations with a leaf position constraint, which limited the distance between neighbouring adjacent MLC leaves, was also investigated. Deliveries were done with and without DMLC tracking on a linear acceleration with a high-resolution MLC. A cylindrical phantom containing two orthogonal diode arrays was used for dosimetry. A motion platform reproduced six patient-derived prostate motion traces, with the average displacement ranging from 1.0 to 8.9 mm during the first 75 s. A research DMLC tracking system was used for real-time motion compensation with optical monitoring for position input. The gamma index was used for evaluation, with measurements with a static phantom or the planned dose as reference, using 2% and 2 mm gamma criteria. The average pass rate with DMLC tracking was 99.9% (range 98.7-100%, measurement as reference), whereas the pass rate for untracked deliveries decreased distinctly as the average displacement increased, with an average pass rate of 61.3% (range 32.7-99.3%). Dose-volume histograms showed that DMLC tracking maintained the planned dose distributions in the presence of motion whereas traces with >3 mm average displacement caused clear plan degradation for untracked deliveries. The dose to the rectum and bladder had an evident dependence on the motion direction and amplitude for untracked deliveries, and the dose to the rectum was slightly increased for IPL boosted plans compared to conventional plans for anterior motion with large amplitude. In conclusion, optimization using a leaf position constraint had minimal dosimetric effect, DMLC tracking improved the target and normal tissue dose distributions compared to no tracking for target motion >3 mm, with the DMLC tracking distributions showing generally good agreement between the planned and delivered doses.""","""['Tobias Pommer', 'Marianne Falk', 'Per R Poulsen', 'Paul J Keall', ""Ricky T O'Brien"", 'Peter Meidahl Petersen', 'Per Munck af Rosenschöld']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Time-resolved dose distributions to moving targets during volumetric modulated arc therapy with and without dynamic MLC tracking.', 'The impact of leaf width and plan complexity on DMLC tracking of prostate intensity modulated arc therapy.', 'DMLC tracking and gating can improve dose coverage for prostate VMAT.', 'Experimental investigation of dynamic real-time rotation-including dose reconstruction during prostate tracking radiotherapy.', 'A review of progress of real-time tumor tracking radiotherapy technology based on dynamic multi-leaf collimator.', 'A conceptual study on real-time adaptive radiation therapy optimization through ultra-fast beamlet control.', 'Commissioning of a motion system to investigate dosimetric consequences due to variability of respiratory waveforms.', 'Time-resolved dose distributions to moving targets during volumetric modulated arc therapy with and without dynamic MLC tracking.', 'The impact of leaf width and plan complexity on DMLC tracking of prostate intensity modulated arc therapy.']"""

To determine the influence of rapamycin on (177)Lu-RM2 tumor uptake, in vivo small-animal PET studies with (68)Ga-RM2 were performed after treatment with rapamycin. To study the efficacy of (177)Lu-RM2 in vivo, mice with subcutaneous PC-3 tumors were treated with (177)Lu-RM2 alone or after pretreatment with rapamycin.  Results:   Stable expression of GRPr was maintained after rapamycin treatment with doses up to 4 mg/kg in vivo. Monotherapy with (177)Lu-RM2 at higher doses (72 and 144 MBq) was effective in inducing complete tumor remission in 60% of treated mice.

It is not only a key player in regulating cellular growth and proliferation, but also behaves as a potent suppressor of apoptosis. CK2 has been frequently found to be deregulated (mostly hyperactivated) in all cancers, prostate cancer being prominent of them. In the recent past, tumor suppressor PML (promyelocytic leukemia) has been shown to be a target of phosphorylation by CK2. This phosphorylation promotes the ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation of PML thereby effectively curbing its role as a tumor suppressor. Among many others, PML has also been established to mediate its tumor suppressive role by mitigating the inactivation of active AKT (pAKT) inside the nucleus by assembling a dephosphorylating platform for nuclear pAKT. One of the immediate consequences, of this inactivation is the stabilization of FOXO3a, another well-established tumor suppressor, inside the nucleus and its downstream activities. Here, we propose a novel signaling axis apexed by deregulated CK2, dismantling the association of PML and PHLPP2 (we also report PHLPP2 to be a novel interacting partner of PML inside the nucleus), ultimately leading to the inactivation and nuclear exclusion of FOXO3a, thereby downregulating p21/p27/Bim in which degradation of PML and the concomitant stabilization of pAKT plays a cardinal part.""","""['A Chatterjee', 'U Chatterjee', 'M K Ghosh']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Cell Death Dis""","""['A CK2-dependent mechanism for degradation of the PML tumor suppressor.', 'Identification of a tumour suppressor network opposing nuclear Akt function.', 'FOXO3a: a novel player in thyroid carcinogenesis?', 'New insights into the cytoplasmic function of PML.', 'Perspectives in PML: a unifying framework for PML function.', 'Protein kinase CK2 - diverse roles in cancer cell biology and therapeutic promise.', 'CK2 and the Hallmarks of Cancer.', 'Placental Mammals Acquired Functional Sequences in NRK for Regulating the CK2-PTEN-AKT Pathway and Placental Cell Proliferation.', 'TRIMming Down Hormone-Driven Cancers: The Biological Impact of TRIM Proteins on Tumor Development, Progression and Prognostication.', 'Tumor Suppressors Having Oncogenic Functions: The Double Agents.']"""

Here, we report that the molecular chaperone Hsp27 (HSPB1) drives EMT in prostate cancer, whereas its attenuation reverses EMT and decreases cell migration, invasion, and matrix metalloproteinase activity. Mechanistically, silencing Hsp27 decreased IL-6-dependent STAT3 phosphorylation, nuclear translocation, and STAT3 binding to the Twist promoter, suggesting that Hsp27 is required for IL-6-mediated EMT via modulation of STAT3/Twist signaling. We observed a correlation between Hsp27 and Twist in patients with prostate cancer, with Hsp27 and Twist expression each elevated in high-grade prostate cancer tumors. Hsp27 inhibition by OGX-427, an antisense therapy currently in phase II trials, reduced tumor metastasis in a murine model of prostate cancer. More importantly, OGX-427 treatment decreased the number of circulating tumor cells in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer in a phase I clinical trial.

Objective:   The purpose of our study was to identify and characterize genes in a clinically relevant gene expression signature in a subgroup of primary PCa positive for transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2)-v-ets erythroblastosis virus E26 oncogene homolog (avian) (ERG).  Design, setting, and participants:   We studied gene expression profiles by unsupervised hierarchical clustering in 48 primary PCas from patients with a long clinical follow-up. Results were correlated with clinical outcome and validated in an independent patient cohort. Selected genes from a defined classifier were tested in vitro for biologic properties.  Intervention:   Initial treatment of primary tumors was radical prostatectomy.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Associations between clinical and histopathologic variables were evaluated by the Pearson χ(2) test, Mann-Whitney U test, or Kruskal-Wallis test, where appropriate. The log-rank test or Breslow method was used for statistical analysis of Kaplan-Meier survival curves.  Results and limitations:   Most tumors that overexpressed ERG clustered separately from other primary PCas. No differences in any clinical end points between ERG-positive and ERG-negative cancers were detected. Importantly, within the ERG-positive samples, two subgroups were identified, which differed significantly in prostate-specific antigen recurrence-free survival, and cancer-specific and overall survival. From our findings, we defined a gene expression classifier of 36 genes. In a second, completely independent tumor set, the classifier also distinguished ERG-positive subgroups with different clinical outcome. In both patient cohorts, the classifier was not predictive in ERG-negative tumors. Biologic processes regulated by genes in the classifier included cell adhesion and bone remodeling. Tumor growth factor-β signaling was indicated as the main differing signaling pathway between the two ERG subgroups. In vitro biologic assays of two selected genes from the classifier (inhibin, beta A [INHBA] and cadherin 11, type 2, OB-cadherin (osteoblast) [CDH11]) supported a functional role in PCa progression. Possible multifocality and limited number of PCa samples can be limitations of the study.

Materials and methods:   One of the detrimental side effects of ADT for prostate cancer is osteoporosis. Through an osteoporosis prevention program implemented in our healthcare system, the patients at risk undergo dual x-ray absorptiometry scans and receive treatment if the T-score indicates bone loss. We evaluated the incidence of hip fracture in men with prostate cancer who were receiving ADT through a retrospective, cohort study conducted within a managed care organization. The participants were all men newly diagnosed with prostate cancer from January 2003 to December 2007 receiving leuprolide injections. Patients who had had a dual x-ray absorptiometry scan beginning 3 months before the index date through the end of study were included in the intervention group; all others were included in the comparison group. The main outcome of interest was a hip fracture occurring after the index date, excluding cancer pathologic fractures, traumatic fractures, and fractures associated with epilepsy.  Results:   A total of 1071 patients were in the intervention group, and 411 were in the comparison group. In the intervention group, 18 hip fractures occurred compared with 17 in the comparison group. The incidence rate of hip fractures per 1000 person-years was 5.1 (95% confidence interval 3.0-8.0) in the intervention group and 18.1 (95% confidence interval 10.5-29.0) in the comparison group.

Methods:   This retrospective study was conducted in 230 patients who underwent prostate needle biopsy and retropubic radical prostatectomy between 2001 and 2011. We analyzed the association between their clinicopathological parameters and ECE.  Results:   Multivariate analysis showed that the Gleason score (P = .023, odds ratio [OR] 1.433), serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA, P = .013, OR 1.040), clinical stage (P = .018, OR 2.162), and PPM (P = .013, OR 2.253) were significant independent predictors for ECE. Next, using these 4 preoperative risk factors, we were able to accurately predict their ECE. Patients with 0 or 1 risk factor had a low probability of ECE (13.0% and 18.5%, respectively). In contrast, the majority of patients who had 3 or 4 risk factors were found to have ECE (80.1% and 71.4%, respectively).

A three-dimensional analysis""","""Objective:   To investigate whether transrectal needle biopsy can be optimised to detect nearly all prostate cancer with a tumour volume (TV) of ≥0.5 mL.  Materials and methods:   Retrospectively analysed 109 whole-mounted and entirely submitted radical prostatectomy specimens with prostate cancer. All tumours in each prostate were outlined on whole-mount slides and digitally scanned to produce tumour maps. Tumour map images were exported to three-dimensional (3D) slicer software (http://www.slicer.org) to develop a 3D-prostate cancer model. In all, 20 transrectal biopsy schemes involving two to 40 cores and two to six anteriorly directed biopsy (ADBx) cores (including transition zone, TZ) were simulated, as well as models with various biopsy cutting lengths. Detection rates for tumours of different volumes were determined for the various biopsy simulation schemes.  Results:   In 109 prostates, 800 tumours were detected, 90 with a TV of ≥0.5 mL (mean TV 0.24 mL). Detection rate for tumours with a TV of ≥0.5 mL plateaued at 77% (69/90) using a 12-core (3 × 4) scheme, standard 17-mm biopsy cutting length without ADBx cores. In all, 20 of 21 (95%) tumours with a TV of ≥0.5 mL not detected by this scheme originated in the anterior peripheral zone or TZ. Increasing the biopsy cutting length and depth/number of ADBx cores improved the detection rate for tumours with a TVof ≥0.5 mL in the 12-core scheme. Using a 22-mm cutting length and a 12-core scheme with additional volume-adjusted ADBx cores, 100% of ≥0.5 mL tumours in prostates ≤ 50 mL in volume and 94.7% of ≥0.5 mL tumours in prostates > 50 mL in volume were detected.  Conclusions:   Our 3D-prostate cancer model analysis suggests that nearly all prostate cancers with a TV of ≥0.5 mL can be detected by 14-18 transrectal needle-biopsy cores. Using longer biopsy cutting lengths and increasing the depth and number of ADBx cores (including TZ) according to prostate volume are necessary as well.""","""['Kent Kanao', 'James A Eastham', 'Peter T Scardino', 'Victor E Reuter', 'Samson W Fine']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Virtual prostate biopsy and biopsy simulation: lessons to be learned.', 'Evaluation of a prostate biopsy strategy for cancer detection using a computer simulation system with virtual needle biopsy for three-dimensional prostate models.', 'Optimal sampling sites for repeat prostate biopsy: a recursive partitioning analysis of three-dimensional 26-core systematic biopsy.', 'Individualization of the biopsy protocol according to the prostate gland volume for prostate cancer detection.', 'Prostate biopsy: who, how and when.

Methods:   Data were obtained from 699 men participating in a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled Phase 3 clinical trial investigating the effects of two doses of selenium (200 and 400 μg/day) compared with placebo on the incidence of prostate cancer. Subjects were followed every 6 months for up to 5 years. Serum glucose levels were obtained every 6 months. Mixed-effects regression models were used to assess whether the rate of change of serum glucose levels was significantly different in the selenium-supplemented groups compared with placebo. Sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the robustness of findings and to minimize the possibility of residual bias due to fasting status.  Results:   Of the total 2893 glucose measurements, 734 were performed when the subject had been fasting for ≥8 h. Changes in serum glucose levels during the course of the trial did not differ significantly between the placebo and selenium 200 μg/day (P = 0.98) and 400 μg/day (P = 0.81) groups.

Although the loss of ERβ and consequent HIF-1 activation occur in prostate cancer with profound consequences, the mechanism by which ERβ promotes the degradation of HIF-1α is unknown. We report that ERβ regulates the ligand (3β-adiol)-dependent transcription of prolyl hydroxylase 2 (PHD2) also known as Egl nine homolog 1 (EGLN1), a 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase that hydroxylates HIF-1α and targets it for recognition by the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor and consequent degradation. ERβ promotes PHD2 transcription by interacting with a unique estrogen response element in the 5' UTR of the PHD2 gene that functions as an enhancer. PHD2 itself is critical for maintaining epithelial differentiation. Loss of PHD2 expression or inhibition of its function results in dedifferentiation with characteristics of an epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and exogenous PHD2 expression in dedifferentiated cells can restore an epithelial phenotype. Moreover, expression of HIF-1α in cells that express PHD2 does not induce dedifferentiation but expression of HIF-1α containing mutations in the proline residues that are hydroxylated by PHD2 induces dedifferentiation. These data describe a unique mechanism for the regulation of HIF-1α stability that involves ERβ-mediated transcriptional regulation of PHD2 and they highlight an unexpected role for PHD2 in maintaining epithelial differentiation.""","""['Paul Mak', 'Cheng Chang', 'Bryan Pursell', 'Arthur M Mercurio']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A""","""['Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) promotes its degradation by induction of HIF-alpha-prolyl-4-hydroxylases.', 'Hypoxia Upregulates Estrogen Receptor β in Pulmonary Artery Endothelial Cells in a HIF-1α-Dependent Manner.', 'Prolyl hydroxylase 2 dependent and Von-Hippel-Lindau independent degradation of Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 and 2 alpha by selenium in clear cell renal cell carcinoma leads to tumor growth inhibition.', 'Involvement of oxygen-sensing pathways in physiologic and pathologic erythropoiesis.', 'Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) pathway.', 'Estrogen Receptor β4 Regulates Chemotherapy Resistance and Induces Cancer Stem Cells in Triple Negative Breast Cancer.', 'Hypoxia as a Modulator of Inflammation and Immune Response in Cancer.', 'Estrogen Receptor Beta (ERβ): A Ligand Activated Tumor Suppressor.', 'Antitumor effects of aconitine in A2780\xa0cells via estrogen receptor β‑mediated apoptosis, DNA damage and migration.', 'Estrogen receptor β exerts tumor suppressive effects in prostate cancer through repression of androgen receptor activity.']"""

The complication rates of open and robot-assisted radical prostatectomy were compared with the χ(2) or Fisher exact test. The distributions of quantitative variables were compared with U tests.  Results:   Whereas the demographic factors favored patients selected for robot-assisted radical prostatectomy, there were no differences between open and robot-assisted surgery concerning length of stay, autologous blood transfusion rates and the incidence of perioperative complications.

Materials and methods:   At 8 tertiary care centers a total of 4,261 patients underwent complete removal and pathological analysis of the prostatic anterior fat pad. We describe preoperative and pathological characteristics, and clinical management and outcomes in patients with metastatic disease to the prostatic anterior fat pad.  Results:   Metastatic disease to the prostatic anterior fat pad lymph nodes was detected in 40 patients (0.94%), of whom 37 (92.5%) had intermediate or high risk features preoperatively. Most patients with prostatic anterior fat pad metastases underwent concomitant pelvic lymph node dissection, and adjuvant therapy with radiation, androgen ablation and/or chemotherapy.

Conclusions:   Most patients with prostatic anterior fat pad metastatic disease had intermediate to high risk features preoperatively. In some patients with such lymph node metastasis removing these lymph nodes resulted in prolonged biochemical recurrence-free survival.

Propionibacterium acnes is frequently referred to as an anaerobic skin commensal of relatively low pathogenicity. In addition to its accepted pathogenic role in acne, P. acnes is now emerging as an important opportunistic pathogen in many other clinical situations, including late-stage prosthetic joint infections, osteomyelitis, endocarditis, endophthalmitis, post-neurosurgical infections and possibly prostate cancer. At the population genetic level, P. acnes can be differentiated into a number of distinct phylogroups, known as types IA1, IA2, IB, IC, II and III, which may be associated with different types of infections and clinical conditions. The aim of the present study was to evaluate MS-based typing for resolution of these genetic groups after routine identification by MALDI-TOF MS (Bruker MALDI Biotyper). The software package ClinProTools 2.2 was used to analyze the protein based mass spectra of reference strains belonging to types IA, IB, IC, II and III. Phylogroup-specific peaks and peak shifts were then identified visually. In addition, peak variations between the different types of P. acnes were investigated by using FlexAnalysis 3.3 software (Bruker). A differentiating library was created, which was used to type further 48 clinical isolates of P. acnes. Typing data obtained by MALDI-TOF MS were then compared with the results from Multilocus Sequence Typing (MLST). Most of the clinical isolates (n = 19) belonged to the type IA grouping according to MALDI-TOF MS. By MLST, all isolates were identified as type IA1. Twenty-one clinical isolates belonged to the type IB cluster based on both MALDI-TOF MS and MLST typing. Eight clinical isolates were identified as type II strains by both typing methods and all the type III reference strains could be distinguished by the presence of a unique type III-specific peak (7238 Da) by the MALDI-TOF MS. Our study demonstrates that MALDI-TOF MS is a reliable and powerful tool for rapid identification and typing of P. acnes strains from the main genetic divisions of the species.""","""['Elisabeth Nagy', 'Edit Urbán', 'Simone Becker', 'Markus Kostrzewa', 'Andrea Vörös', 'Judit Hunyadkürti', 'István Nagy']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Anaerobe""","""['Species identification of clinical isolates of Bacteroides by matrix-assisted laser-desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry.', 'Multiplex touchdown PCR for rapid typing of the opportunistic pathogen Propionibacterium acnes.', 'Multilocus sequence typing and repetitive-sequence-based PCR (DiversiLab) for molecular epidemiological characterization of Propionibacterium acnes isolates of heterogeneous origin.', 'Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, a revolution in clinical microbial identification.', 'Maldi-tof mass spectrometry for microorganism identification.', 'Carbapenemase Producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (KPC): What Is the Best MALDI-TOF MS Detection Method.', 'What Do We See in Spectra?: Assignment of High-Intensity Peaks of Cutibacterium and Staphylococcus Spectra of MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry by Interspecies Comparative Proteogenomics.', 'Cutibacterium acnes as an Opportunistic Pathogen: An Update of Its Virulence-Associated Factors.', 'Classification of Cutibacterium acnes at phylotype level by MALDI-MS proteotyping.', 'Evaluation of Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry and ClinPro Tools as a Rapid Tool for Typing Streptococcus pyogenes.']"""

Methods:   We used statistical models to estimate national incidence and mortality rates in 2012 from recently-published data, predicting incidence and mortality rates for the year 2012 from recent trends, wherever possible. The estimated rates in 2012 were applied to the corresponding population estimates to obtain the estimated numbers of new cancer cases and deaths in Europe in 2012.  Results:   There were an estimated 3.45 million new cases of cancer (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer) and 1.75 million deaths from cancer in Europe in 2012. The most common cancer sites were cancers of the female breast (464,000 cases), followed by colorectal (447,000), prostate (417,000) and lung (410,000). These four cancers represent half of the overall burden of cancer in Europe. The most common causes of death from cancer were cancers of the lung (353,000 deaths), colorectal (215,000), breast (131,000) and stomach (107,000). In the European Union, the estimated numbers of new cases of cancer were approximately 1.4 million in males and 1.2 million in females, and around 707,000 men and 555,000 women died from cancer in the same year.  Conclusion:   These up-to-date estimates of the cancer burden in Europe alongside the description of the varying distribution of common cancers at both the regional and country level provide a basis for establishing priorities to cancer control actions in Europe. The important role of cancer registries in disease surveillance and in planning and evaluating national cancer plans is becoming increasingly recognised, but needs to be further advocated.

Materials and methods:   Forty-six patients who underwent prostate MRI before salvage HIFU for locally recurrent prostate cancer after EBRT were retrospectively studied. HIFU failure was defined as a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) value >nadir + 2 ng/ml (Phoenix criteria) or positive follow-up biopsy or initiation of any other salvage therapy. The following prognostic parameters were assessed: neoadjuvant hormone therapy, clinical stage and Gleason score of recurrence, PSA level and velocity at HIFU treatment, and six MRI-derived parameters (prostate volume, tumour volume, extracapsular extension, seminal vesicle invasion, tumour extension into the apex or anterior to the urethra).  Results:   Two factors were significant independent predictors of salvage HIFU failure: the PSA level at HIFU treatment (p < 0.012; risk ratio: 1.15, 95% CI: 1.03-1.29) and the tumour extension anterior to the urethra, as assessed by MRI (p = 0.046, risk ratio: 2.51, 95% CI: 1.02-6.16).

Materials and methods:   An inflatable balloon device was placed, interstitially and under transrectal ultrasound guidance, into the rectal-prostate interspace prior treatment initiation of 26 patients with localized prostate cancer, who elected to be treated with radiotherapy (3D CRT or IMRT). The pre- and post-implant CT imaging data of twenty two patients were collected (44 images) for the purpose of the 3D conformal virtual planning presented herein.  Results:   The dorsal prostate-ventral rectal wall separation resulted in an average reduction of the rectal V70% by 55.3% (± 16.8%), V80% by 64.0% (± 17.7%), V90% by 72.0% (± 17.1%), and V100% by 82.3% (± 24.1%). In parallel, rectal D2 ml and D0.1 ml were reduced by 15.8% (± 11.4%) and 3.9% (± 6.4%), respectively.  Conclusions:   Insertion of the biodegradable balloon into the prostate-rectum interspace is similar to other published invasive procedures. In this virtual dose distribution analysis, the balloon insertion resulted in a remarkable reduction of rectal volume exposed to high radiation doses. This effect has the potential to keep the rectal dose lower especially when higher than usual prostate dose escalation protocols or hypo-fractionated regimes are used.

Here we present a novel model system using the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to study human S100A8 and S100A9 aggregation and toxicity. We found that S100A8, S100A9 and S100A8/9 cotransfomants form SDS-resistant non-toxic aggregates in yeast cells. Using fluorescently tagged proteins, we showed that S100A8 and S100A9 accumulate in foci. After prolonged induction, S100A8 foci localized to the cell vacuole, whereas the S100A9 foci remained in the cytoplasm when present alone, but entered the vacuole in cotransformants. Biochemical analysis of the proteins indicated that S100A8 and S100A9 alone or coexpressed together form amyloid-like aggregates in yeast. Expression of S100A8 and S100A9 in wild type yeast did not affect cell viability, but these proteins were toxic when expressed on a background of unrelated metastable temperature-sensitive mutant proteins, Cdc53-1p, Cdc34-2p, Srp1-31p and Sec27-1p. This finding suggests that the expression and aggregation of S100A8 and S100A9 may limit the capacity of the cellular proteostasis machinery. To test this hypothesis, we screened a set of chaperone deletion mutants and found that reducing the levels of the heat-shock proteins Hsp104p and Hsp70p was sufficient to induce S100A8 and S100A9 toxicity. This result indicates that the chaperone activity of the Hsp104/Hsp70 bi-chaperone system in wild type cells is sufficient to reduce S100A8 and S100A9 amyloid toxicity and preserve cellular proteostasis. Expression of human S100A8 and S100A9 in yeast thus provides a novel model system for the study of the interaction of amyloid deposits with the proteostasis machinery.""","""['Ekaterina Eremenko', 'Anat Ben-Zvi', 'Ludmilla A Morozova-Roche', 'Dina Raveh']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Pro-inflammatory S100A8 and S100A9 proteins: self-assembly into multifunctional native and amyloid complexes.', 'Calcium-dependent tetramer formation of S100A8 and S100A9 is essential for biological activity.', 'Amyloid formation by the pro-inflammatory S100A8/A9 proteins in the ageing prostate.', 'The antimicrobial heterodimer S100A8/S100A9 (calprotectin) is upregulated by bacterial flagellin in human epidermal keratinocytes.', 'S100A8 and S100A9 in inflammation and cancer.', ""Natural Compound from Olive Oil Inhibits S100A9 Amyloid Formation and Cytotoxicity: Implications for Preventing Alzheimer's Disease."", ""S100A9-Driven Amyloid-Neuroinflammatory Cascade in Traumatic Brain Injury as a Precursor State for Alzheimer's Disease."", 'Uncoupling the Trade-Off between Somatic Proteostasis and Reproduction in Caenorhabditis elegans Models of Polyglutamine Diseases.', 'A Bystander Mechanism Explains the Specific Phenotype of a Broadly Expressed Misfolded Protein.', 'Using Caenorhabditis elegans as a model system to study protein homeostasis in a multicellular organism.']"""

When searched in the PrognoScan database, human RON was also found to be expressed in bladder, blood, breast, glioma, esophageal, colorectal, head and neck, ovarian, lung and skin cancer. The relationship between the expression of RON and prognosis was found to vary in different cancer types, even in the same cancer from different databases. This suggests that the function of RON in these tumors may be multidimensional, not just as a tumor suppressor or oncogene.

It is unclear whether the use of ncADT among older men in the community setting is aligned with the potential for clinical benefit.  Materials and methods:   We used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results–Medicare database to assess patterns of ncADT use among men diagnosed with prostate cancer during 2004–2007 who received radiation therapy. Men were stratified according to tumor risk groups and life expectancy. We used logistic regression to identify factors associated with ncADT use within each risk group.  Results:   There were 10,686 men in the sample (mean age 74.2 years; 83.4% white). The use of ncADT was 80.7%, 54.1%, and 27.8% in the high-, intermediate-, and low-risk groups, respectively. Men with a life expectancy<5 years had higher rates of ncADT use than men with a life expectancy≥10 years in all risk groups. Within each risk group, advancing age was associated with higher likelihood of receiving ncADT (odds ratio for men aged 80–84 compared to 67–69=1.93 (95% CI 1.37–2.70); 1.51 (95% CI 1.22–1.87); and 1.71 (95% CI 1.14–2.57) for high-, intermediate-, and low-risk groups, respectively).

Results:   Thirty-two patients (24.2%) were diagnosed with pT0 disease by pathological evaluation. The positive-core proportion of prostate biopsy was lower, the duration of neoadjuvant ADT was longer, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) nadir before radical prostatectomy was lower in pT0 cases compared to non-pT0 cases, and these differences were statistically significant.

The purpose of this study was to explore the efficacy and mechanisms of action of the combined use of β-elemene plus a taxane as an antitumor therapeutic strategy for ovarian cancer and other carcinomas. The interaction of β-elemene with paclitaxel or docetaxel produced additive to moderately synergistic effects against the platinum-resistant ovarian cancer cell line A2780/CP70 and its parental cell line A2780, and showed moderately synergistic activity against PC-3 prostate cancer cells. In addition, the co-administration of β-elemene and a taxane at low-micromolar concentrations dramatically increased the rate of micronucleus formation and the percentage of mitotic arrest in both ovarian cancer cell lines, as compared with treatment with either agent alone. The highest synergy towards the ovarian cancer cells was observed with β-elemene plus docetaxel. Consistent with these data, treatment of A2780/CP70 cells with β-elemene plus a taxane strikingly reduced cell viability and increased cell apoptosis, as assessed by annexin V binding. Moreover, β-elemene plus docetaxel induced elevated levels of caspase-9 and p53 proteins in A2780/CP70 cells, and the combination of β-elemene plus a taxane caused marked cell-cycle arrest at the G2/M phase in these cells. One possible mechanism to account for the enhanced cytotoxic efficacy of this combination treatment is a β-elemene-induced increase in taxane influx into cancer cells. These observations indicate that combination therapy with β-elemene and taxanes has synergistic antitumor activity against ovarian and prostate carcinomas in vitro. This promising new therapeutic combination warrants further pre-clinical exploration for the treatment of chemoresistant ovarian cancer and other types of tumors.""","""['Baobo Zou', 'Q Quentin Li', 'Jinshun Zhao', 'Jueli M Li', 'Christopher F Cuff', 'Eddie Reed']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Anticancer Res""","""['In vitro combination characterization of the new anticancer plant drug beta-elemene with taxanes against human lung carcinoma.', 'β-Elemene enhances susceptibility to cisplatin in resistant ovarian carcinoma cells via downregulation of ERCC-1 and XIAP and inactivation of JNK.', 'β-elemene effectively suppresses the growth and survival of both platinum-sensitive and -resistant ovarian tumor cells.', 'Risks and benefits of taxanes in breast and ovarian cancer.', 'Docetaxel in the management of ovarian cancer.', 'β-Elemene Improves Morphine Tolerance in Bone Cancer Pain via N-Methyl-D-Aspartate Receptor 2B Subunit-Mediated μ-Opioid Receptor.', 'β-elemene Isopropanolamine Derivative LXX-8250 Induces Apoptosis Through Impairing Autophagic Flux via PFKFB4 Repression in Melanoma Cells.', 'β-Elemene Suppresses Obesity-Induced Imbalance in the Microbiota-Gut-Brain Axis.', 'Treatment with β-elemene combined with paclitaxel inhibits growth, migration, and invasion and induces apoptosis of ovarian cancer cells by activation of STAT-NF-κB pathway.', 'The Antitumor Efficacy of β-Elemene by Changing Tumor Inflammatory Environment and Tumor Microenvironment.']"""

Materials and methods:   3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining, western blotting, and enzymatic assay of caspase-3, -8, and -9 activities were carried out on human malignant mesothelioma cell lines NCI-H28, NCI-H2052, NCI-H2452, and MSTO-211H cells. To knock-down α1D-adrenoceptor, siRNA to silence human α1D-adrenoceptor-targeted gene was constructed and transfected into cells.  Results:   Naftopidil induced apoptosis in all the investigated malignant mesothelioma cells, and a similar effect was obtained with prazosin, another α1-adrenoceptor blocker. α1-Adrenoceptor is linked to Gq/11 protein involving activation of protein kinase C (PKC). Naftopidil-induced reduction in cell viability was inhibited by GF109203X, while prazosin-induced in cell viability was less affected.

We assessed the primary outcome, survival, in the incident cohort; the exposure measure was the quintile of regional spending in the decedent cohort. Survival in quintiles 2 through 5 was compared with that in quintile 1 (lowest spending quintile) using Cox regression models.

Results:   increases of incidence rates were dramatic for renal disease [the average annual percent change (APC) is 8.56%, 95% CI = 7.62, 9.50%], goiter (APC = 6.67%, 95% CI = 5, 90, 7, 44%), melanoma (APC = 6.15%, 95% CI = 4.31, 8.02%) and Alzheimer's disease (APC = 3.96%, 95% CI = 2.67, 5.26%), and less prominent for diabetes and lung cancer. Decreases of incidence rates were remarkable for angina pectoris (APC = -6.17%, 95% CI = -6.96, -5.38%); chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (APC = -5.14%, 95% CI = -6.78,-3.47%), and ulcer (APC = -5.82%, 95% CI = -6.77,-4.86%) and less dramatic for carcinomas of colon and prostate, stroke, hip fracture and asthma. Incidence rates of female breast carcinoma, myocardial infarction, Parkinson's disease and rheumatoid arthritis were almost stable. For most diseases, an excellent agreement was observed for incidence rates between NLTCS-Medicare and SEER-Medicare. A sensitivity analysis proved the stability of the evaluated time trends.  Conclusion:   time trends of the incidence of diseases common in the US elderly population were evaluated. The results show dramatic increase in incidence rates of melanoma, goiter, chronic renal and Alzheimer's disease in 1992-2005. Besides specifying widely recognised time trends on age-associated diseases, new information was obtained for trends of asthma, ulcer and goiter among the older adults in the USA.""","""['Igor Akushevich', 'Julia Kravchenko', 'Svetlana Ukraintseva', 'Konstantin Arbeev', 'Anatoly I Yashin']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Age Ageing""","""['Age patterns of incidence of geriatric disease in the U.S. elderly population: Medicare-based analysis.', 'Morbidity risks among older adults with pre-existing age-related diseases.', 'Age-Specific Incidence of Melanoma in the United States.', 'Cancers with increasing incidence trends in the United States: 1999 through 2008.', 'Annual report to the nation on the status of cancer, 1975-2000, featuring the uses of surveillance data for cancer prevention and control.', ""Incidence of Parkinson's disease and modifiable risk factors in Korean population: A longitudinal follow-up study of a nationwide cohort."", 'Why twin studies are important for health span science research: the case of maltreatment of aging adults.', 'What are the demands of telegeriatrics medical services for elderly patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.', ""Change in the incidence of Parkinson's disease in a large UK primary care database."", ""Analysis of Time Trends in Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias Using Partitioning Approach.""]"""

In this editorial, we take a step back and consider the general question of whether randomized screening trials provide the strongest evidence for clinical guidelines concerning population screening programs. We argue that randomized trials provide a process that is designed to protect against certain biases but that this process does not guarantee that inferences based on empirical results from screening trials will be unbiased. Appropriate quantitative methods are key to obtaining unbiased inferences from screening trials. We highlight several studies in the statistical literature demonstrating that conventional survival analyses of screening trials can be misleading and list a number of key questions concerning screening harms and benefits that cannot be answered without modeling.

One of the distinct characteristics of prostate cancer is over-expression of the ERG proto-oncogene. The TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion, the most common gene fusion, is found in approximately 50% of prostate cancer cases. We show that certain microRNAs are extensively deregulated in prostate cancer cell lines and primary clinical cancer samples. MicroRNAs are capable of modulating post-transcriptional gene expression via inhibition of protein synthesis. Independent target prediction methods have indicated that the 3' untranslated region of the ERG mRNA is a potential target of miR-145. miR-145 is consistently down-regulated in prostate cancer. Here we show that the ERG 3' untranslated region is a regulative target of miR-145 in vitro. Ectopic expression of miR-145 led to a reduction in expression of the ERG protein. We analyzed 26 prostate cancer samples and corresponding normal tissue. ERG protein expression was found to be elevated in the tumor samples, together with increased expression of several ERG isoforms. We identified ERG proteins of 35 and 24 kDa, which may represent unknown ERG splice variants. Analyses of miR-145 and ERG mRNA expression revealed a general down-regulation of miR-145 irrespective of the presence or absence of translocations involving ERG. This observation indicates that down-regulation of miR-145 may contribute to the increased expression of most ERG splice variants sharing the miR-145 target sequence in their 3' untranslated region.""","""['Martin Hart', 'Sven Wach', 'Elke Nolte', 'Jaroslaw Szczyrba', 'Roopika Menon', 'Helge Taubert', 'Arndt Hartmann', 'Robert Stoehr', 'Wolf Wieland', 'Friedrich A Grässer', 'Bernd Wullich']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""FEBS J""","""['Quantitative analysis of ERG expression and its splice isoforms in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded prostate cancer samples: association with seminal vesicle invasion and biochemical recurrence.', 'Abnormal expression of the ERG transcription factor in prostate cancer cells activates osteopontin.', 'TMPRSS2:ERG fusion by translocation or interstitial deletion is highly relevant in androgen-dependent prostate cancer, but is bypassed in late-stage androgen receptor-negative prostate cancer.', 'Significance of the TMPRSS2:ERG gene fusion in prostate cancer.', 'The oncogene ERG: a key factor in prostate cancer.', ""miR-4482 and miR-3912 aim for 3'UTR of ERG mRNA in prostate cancer."", 'Changes of Protein Expression after CRISPR/Cas9 Knockout of miRNA-142 in Cell Lines Derived from Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma.', 'Loss of RBMS1 as a regulatory target of miR-106b influences cell growth, gap closing and colony forming in prostate carcinoma.', 'Ensemble of decision tree reveals potential miRNA-disease associations.', 'miR-34a as hub of T cell regulation networks.']"""

Here, a multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT)-based rolling circle amplification system (CRCAS) is reported which allows in situ rolling circle replication of DNA primer on the surface of MWCNTs to create a long single-strand DNA (ssDNA) where a large number of nanoparticles or proteins could be loaded, forming a nano-biohybridized 3D structure with a powerful signal amplification ability. In this strategy, the binding ability of proteins, hybridization, replication ability of DNA, and the catalytical ability of enzymes are integrated on a single carbon nanotube. The CRCAS is then used to develop colorimetric and chemiluminescent assays for the highly sensitive and specific detection of cancer protein markers, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and prostate specific antigen (PSA). The colorimetric CRCAS assay is 4000 times more sensitive than a conventional enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and its concentration range is 10,000 times wider. Control experiments show that as low as 10 pg mL⁻¹ AFP or PSA could be detected even in the presence of interfering protein markers with a more than 10⁵-fold greater concentration in the sample, demonstrating the high specificity of the CRCAS assay. The limit of detection of the chemiluminescent CRCAS assays for AFP and PSA are 5 fg mL⁻¹ (70 aM) and 10 fg mL⁻¹ (0.29 fM), respectively, indicating that the sensitivity is much higher than that of the colorimetric CRCAS assay.

Methods:   The phase 3 Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 9413 trial, as part of its original protocol, used the assessment of PSA-CR (ie, PSA ≤0.3 ng/mL) at the end of short-term HT as a secondary endpoint. Short-term HT consisted of futamide plus a lutenizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist for 4 months. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival. Cumulative incidence was used to estimate biochemical failure, distant metastasis, and disease-specific survival. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to correlate PSA-CR after short-term hormone therapy with all endpoints, and the following variables were considered for analysis: PSA at baseline, Gleason score, treatment arm, age, and baseline testosterone status. Phoenix consensus definition was used to define PSA failure.  Results:   For 1070 evaluable patients, the median PSA at the end of short-term hormone therapy was 0.2 ng/mL. In total, 744 patients (70%) had a PSA-CR. At a median follow-up of 7.2 years, failure to obtain a PSA-CR was associated significantly with worse disease-specific survival (P = .0003; hazard ratio [HR], 2.03; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.38-2.97), with worse disease-free survival (P = .003; HR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.09-1.50), and with a higher incidence of distant metastasis (P = .0002; HR, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.37-2.69) and biochemical failure (P < .0001; HR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.29-1.91).

Results:   The positive surgical margins (PSM) were identified as follows: 29.3% (RRP) versus 25.4% (RALP) in pT2 cancer (p 0.563), and 63.6% (RRP) versus 50.0% (RALP) in case of >pT2 cancer (p 0.559). If stratified by surgical approach, the results are: 53.3% (RRP) versus 25.6% (RALP) (p <0.001) in case of nerve-sparing technique. The persistence of disease is detectable in 5.4% (RRP) versus 4.6% (RALP), while the data on biochemical recurrence are: 2.7% (RRP) versus 0% (RALP).  Conclusions:   In our experience, in two groups of patients matched for clinic-pathological features who underwent RRP and RALP, oncological results are slightly better in the second group; this figure is even more significant when evaluating surgeries conducted with nerve-sparing technique.

Logistic regression analysis revealed that a crisis-oriented intervention approach was associated with a substantially reduced likelihood of screening. A positive correlation was noted between the use of Eastern medicine and PSA test receipt. Further analysis revealed a significant interaction effect between use of Eastern medicine and age in predicting PSA test uptake.

We aimed to investigate the association between stage of cancer at diagnosis with neighborhood of residence (as proxy for SES) and ethnicity/race, while controlling for each other, in selected areas of New York City (NYC).  Methods:   The cancer summary data (1999-2008) were provided by the New York State Cancer Registry. Multinomial logistic regression models were applied to calculate risk estimates for being diagnosed with late- or unknown-stage (versus early-stage) cancers in two low-SES and two high-SES neighborhoods of NYC and among several ethnic/racial groups for all cancers combined and cancers of the female breast, lung, colorectum, and prostate, with additional adjustments for sex (for all cancers combined), age, and year of diagnosis.  Results:   A total of 34,981 cancer cases were included in this study. There were significant and independent ethnic/racial and neighborhood disparities in stage of cancer at diagnosis of most of the cancers studied. The effect of ethnicity/race on the disparity appeared stronger than the effect of neighborhood. There was an overall decreasing trend in the proportion of late-stage cancers, particularly for colorectal cancer, and to a greater extent in the proportion of cancers without staging information.  Conclusions:   In this population, ethnicity/race seems to be a stronger predictor for late stage at diagnosis than SES, stressing the need for ethnicity/race-oriented programs for cancer screening and improved access to care.""","""['Farhad Islami', 'Amy R Kahn', 'Nina A Bickell', 'Maria J Schymura', 'Paolo Boffetta']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Cancer Causes Control""","""['Cancer in relation to socioeconomic status: stage at diagnosis in Texas, 2004-2008.', 'Cancer survival disparities by race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status in New Jersey.', 'Racial and ethnic disparities in cancer survival by neighborhood socioeconomic status in Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Registries.', 'Ethnic density and cancer: A review of the evidence.', 'Race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status: measurement and methodological issues.', 'A novel method for measuring the burden of breast cancer in neighborhoods.', 'Impact of paternal education on epigenetic ageing in adolescence and mid-adulthood: a multi-cohort study in the USA and Mexico.', 'Narrative review of socioeconomic and racial disparities in the treatment of early stage lung cancer.', 'Disparities in mortality-to-incidence ratios by race/ethnicity for female breast cancer in New York City, 2002-2016.', 'Effect Modification of the Association Between Race and Stage at Colorectal Cancer Diagnosis by Socioeconomic Status.']"""

MRP4 is widely expressed in benign and neoplastic prostate epithelia, but its expression gradually decreases during tumor progression towards castrate-resistant disease. Concordantly, it correlated with conventional prognosticators of disease progression and-within the group of androgen-dependent tumors-with AR and FoxA expression. Moreover, lower levels of MRP4 expression were associated with shorter PSA relapse-free survival times in the androgen-dependent group. In benign tissues, we found zone-dependent differences of MRP4 expression, with the highest levels in the peripheral and central zones.

Using both primary prostatic epithelial cultures and laser capture-microdissected prostate epithelium from 45 patients enrolled in a vitamin D3 randomized trial, we identified miR-100 and -125b as targets of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25D). In patients, miR-100 and -125b levels were significantly lower in tumor tissue than in benign prostate. Similarly, miR-100 and -125b were lower in primary prostate cancer cells than in cells derived from benign prostate. Prostatic concentrations of 1,25D positively correlated with these miRNA levels in both prostate cancer and benign epithelium, showing that patients with prostate cancer may still benefit from vitamin D3. In cell assays, upregulation of these miRNAs by 1,25D was vitamin D receptor dependent. Transfection of pre-miR-100 and pre-miR-125b in the presence or absence of 1,25D decreased invasiveness of cancer cell, RWPE-2. Pre-miR-100 and pre-miR-125b decreased proliferation in primary cells and cancer cells respectively. Pre-miR-125b transfection suppressed migration and clonal growth of prostate cancer cells, whereas knockdown of miR-125b in normal cells increased migration indicates a tumor suppressor function. 1,25D suppressed expression of previously bona fide mRNA targets of these miRNAs, E2F3 and Plk1, in a miRNA-dependent manner.

The androgen-independent human prostate cancer cell lines PC3 (lacking a functional AR) and DU145 (strongly limited expression due to methylations in the AR gene) were used. PCR of bisulfite-modified DNA and RT-PCR with bisulfite-sequencing were used for AR gene analysis of DU145 and PC3 cells following their treatment with Aza-dC and/or NaB. Re-acetylated histones around the AR gene were detected by conventional PCR of immunoprecipitated DNA obtained from treated cells. In both cell lines without the AR expression, the combined treatment was followed with significant decrease of cell viability. The co-treatment of DU145 cells caused site-specific demethylation in the AR promoter region followed by gene re-expression and increased acetylation in histones H3 and H4. The co-treatment with Aza-dC and NaB was the most effective in demethylation and re-expression of the AR gene.

Here, we report that androgen represses the miR-99a/let7c/125b-2 cluster through AR and anti-androgen drugs block the androgen-repression of the miRNA cluster. AR directly binds to the host gene of the miR-99a/let7c/125b-2 cluster, LINC00478. Expression of the cluster is repressed or activated by chromatin remodelers EZH2 or JMJD3 in the presence or absence of androgen, respectively. Bioinformatics analysis reveals a significant enrichment of targets of miR-99a, let-7c and miR-125b in androgen-induced gene sets, suggesting that downregulation of the miR-99a/let7c/125b-2 cluster by androgen protects many of their target mRNAs from degradation and indirectly assists in the gene induction. We validated the hypothesis with 12 potential targets of the miR-99a/let7c/125b-2 cluster induced by androgen: 9 out of the 12 mRNAs are downregulated by the microRNA cluster. To ascertain the biological significance of this hypothesis, we focused on IGF1R, a known prostate cancer growth factor that is induced by androgen and directly targeted by the miR-99a/let7c/125b-2 cluster. The androgen-induced cell proliferation is ameliorated to a similar extent as anti-androgen drugs by preventing the repression of the microRNAs or induction of IGF1R in androgen-dependent prostate cancer cells. Expression of a microRNA-resistant form of IGF1R protects these cells from inhibition by the miR-99a/let7c/125b-2 cluster. These results indicate that a thorough understanding of how androgen stimulates prostate cancer growth requires not only an understanding of genes directly induced/repressed by AR, but also of genes indirectly induced by AR through the repression of key microRNAs.""","""['D Sun', 'R Layer', 'A C Mueller', 'M A Cichewicz', 'M Negishi', 'B M Paschal', 'A Dutta']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['Genome-wide screen identified let-7c/miR-99a/miR-125b regulating tumor progression and stem-like properties in cholangiocarcinoma.', 'Slow Transcription of the 99a/let-7c/125b-2 Cluster Results in Differential MiRNA Expression and Promotes Melanoma Phenotypic Plasticity.', 'Systematic analysis of berberine-induced signaling pathway between miRNA clusters and mRNAs and identification of mir-99a ∼ 125b cluster function by seed-targeting inhibitors in multiple myeloma cells.', 'Androgen receptor and miR-206 regulation in prostate cancer.', 'Good guy or bad guy: the opposing roles of microRNA 125b in cancer.', 'Serum miRNA profiles are altered in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis receiving high-dose ursodeoxycholic acid.', 'Molecular Mechanisms of Noncoding RNA in the Occurrence of Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Increased Serum Levels of miR-125b and miR-132 in Fragile X Syndrome: A Preliminary Study.', 'Epstein-Barr virus-encoded microRNA BART22 serves as novel biomarkers and drives malignant transformation of nasopharyngeal carcinoma.', 'Interaction between Non-Coding RNAs and Androgen Receptor with an Especial Focus on Prostate Cancer.']"""

Genomic DNA was isolated and short tandem repeat analysis was performed at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center Characterized Cell Line Core Facility, Johns Hopkins University Fragment Analysis Facility and RIKEN BioResource Center, Ibaraki, Japan. Comparative genomic hybridization was performed on a platform (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, California) at Vancouver Prostate Centre.  Results:   The short tandem repeat profile of all KU7 clones was an exact match with that of HeLa. Comparative genomic hybridization of all samples revealed an abundance of shared chromosomal aberrations. Slight differences in some genomic areas were explained by genomic drift in different KU7 clones separated by many years.  Conclusions:   Our analysis identified that cross contamination of KU7 with HeLa occurred before 1984 at the source institution. All KU7 clones in the urological literature should be considered HeLa and experimental results should be viewed in this light. Our results emphasize the need to authenticate cell lines in oncological research.""","""['Wolfgang Jäger', 'Yutaka Horiguchi', 'Jay Shah', 'Tetsutaro Hayashi', 'Shannon Awrey', 'Kilian M Gust', 'Boris A Hadaschik', 'Yoshiyuki Matsui', 'Shawn Anderson', 'Robert H Bell', 'Susan Ettinger', 'Alan I So', 'Martin E Gleave', 'I-Ling Lee', 'Colin P Dinney', 'Masaaki Tachibana', 'David J McConkey', 'Peter C Black']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['The use of short tandem repeat profiling to characterize human bladder cancer cell lines.', 'Cross-contamination of the human salivary gland HSG cell line with HeLa cells: A STR analysis study.', 'Chromosomal imbalances in successive moments of human bladder urothelial carcinoma.', 'Authentication of Human and Mouse Cell Lines by Short Tandem Repeat (STR) DNA Genotype Analysis.', 'The bladder cancer genome; chromosomal changes as prognostic makers, opportunities, and obstacles.', ""Molecular characterization and genetic authentication assay for Anopheles 'hemocyte-like' cell lines 4a-3A and 4a-3B."", 'Development of a murine intravesical orthotopic human bladder cancer (mio-hBC) model.', 'Systematic Review: Characteristics and\xa0Preclinical Uses of Bladder Cancer Cell\xa0Lines.', 'An orthotopic xenograft model for high-risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer in mice: influence of mouse strain, tumor cell count, dwell time and bladder pretreatment.', 'The establishment of a growth-controllable orthotopic bladder cancer model through the down-regulation of c-myc expression.']"""

PTHrP also increases cell survival and migration, and upregulates pro-invasive integrin α6β4 expression. We used the human CaP cell lines C4-2 and PC-3 as model systems to study the mechanisms via which PTHrP regulates α6β4 levels. We report that PTHrP regulates α6 and β4 levels via a transcriptional pathway; β4 regulation involves the NF-κB pathway. PTHrP also regulates β4 levels at the post-translational level. PTHrP inhibits caspase-3 and -7 activities. Post-translational regulation of β4 by PTHrP is mediated via attenuation of its proteolytic cleavage by these caspases. Since α6 dimerizes with β4, increased β4 levels result in elevated α6 levels. Suppressing β4 using siRNA attenuates the effect of caspase inhibition on apoptosis and cell migration. These results provide evidence of a link between PTHrP, integrin α6β4 levels as a function of caspase activity, and cell survival and migration. Targeting PTHrP in CaP cancer, thereby reversing the effect on caspase activity and α6β4 levels, may thus prove therapeutically beneficial.""","""['Vandanajay Bhatia', 'Ramanjaneya V R Mula', 'Miriam Falzon']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Exp Cell Res""","""['Parathyroid hormone-related protein regulates cell survival pathways via integrin alpha6beta4-mediated activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt signaling.', 'PTH-related protein upregulates integrin alpha6beta4 expression and activates Akt in breast cancer cells.', 'PTHrP contributes to the anti-proliferative and integrin alpha6beta4-regulating effects of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3).', 'Proteolytic Regulation of Parathyroid Hormone-Related Protein: Functional Implications for Skeletal Malignancy.', 'Regulation of Kinase Signaling Pathways by α6β4-Integrins and Plectin in Prostate Cancer.', 'Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA) Promotes Angiogenesis of Glioblastoma Through Interacting With ITGB4 and Regulating NF-κB Signaling Pathway.', 'The MET/Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor (VEGFR)-targeted Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor Also Attenuates FMS-dependent Osteoclast Differentiation and Bone Destruction Induced by Prostate Cancer.']"""

Even though several biomarkers are in use in diagnosis and prognosis of the disease, they are marred by limited specificity and sensitivity. The human kallikrein-related peptidase 10 (KLK10) gene is a member of the human tissue kallikrein family. Because prostate specific antigen (PSA), the best biomarker for detecting and monitoring prostate cancer, is a member of this family, many other members, including KLK10, have been widely examined as novel biomarkers for different cancer types. In previous studies, KLK10 has been proposed as a diagnostic biomarker for ovarian carcinoma, while its methylation on exon 3 has been proposed as a prognostic marker for early-stage breast cancer patients. The purpose of this study was to analyse KLK10 mRNA expression and examine its prognostic value and potential clinical application as a novel molecular tissue biomarker in CRC.  Design and methods:   The study group consisted of 190 colorectal samples. Total RNA was extracted from pulverised tissues and cDNA was prepared by reverse transcription. KLK10 was amplified by real-time PCR. B2M was used as a reference gene and HT-29 cells as positive control.  Results:   KLK10 expression was significantly higher in cancer tissues (P<0.001). Tumours of advanced TNM and Dukes' stage showed high KLK10 expression status (P=0.036; P=0.025). Patients with high KLK10 expression had a shorter disease-free and overall survival rates (P=0.014; P=0.020).

Rates of the most common malignancies have been generally increasing. We update an evaluation of mortality trends in the major cancers in Colombia one decade ago, discussing the trends in the context of cancer control.  Methods:   We calculated the annual age-standardized mortality rates for the major cancer sites by sex between 1984 and 2008; we also present the estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) for the entire period and for the last decade.  Results:   There was an average of 32,000 cancer deaths annually in Colombia in the period studied. Overall cancer mortality rates decreased slightly in both men and women. The four most common sites of cancer death among men were stomach (17.6%), prostate (15.0%), lung (14.8%) and colorectum (6.5%). In women, the most common cancer sites were breast (12.3%), cervix (12.1%), stomach (11.5%) and lung (9.2%). Colorectal and CNS cancers exhibited the greatest increases (EAPC of 2.0% and 3.4% respectively) while the largest declines were seen for cancers of the larynx, stomach and oesophagus (EAPC between -3% and -4%). In the last decade, the greatest declines were seen in cervical cancer mortality rates (EAPC = -3.2).  Conclusions:   The slight decrease in mortality trends from all cancers combined is partially driven by the strong declines in mortality of stomach and cervical cancer.

Objective:   To determine the cost-effectiveness of robotic prostatectomy.  Design, setting, and participants:   We conducted a care pathway description and model-based cost-utility analysis. We studied men with localised prostate cancer able to undergo either robotic or laparoscopic prostatectomy for cure. We used data from a meta-analysis, other published literature, and costs from the UK National Health Service and commercial sources.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Care received by men for 10 yr following radical prostatectomy was modelled. Clinical events, their effect on quality of life, and associated costs were synthesised assuming 200 procedures were performed annually.  Results and limitations:   Over 10 yr, robotic prostatectomy was on average (95% confidence interval [CI]) £1412 (€1595) (£1304 [€1473] to £1516 [€1713]) more costly than laparoscopic prostatectomy but more effective with mean (95% CI) gain in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) of 0.08 (0.01-0.15). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was £18 329 (€20 708) with an 80% probability that robotic prostatectomy was cost effective at a threshold of £30 000 (€33 894)/QALY. The ICER was sensitive to the throughput of cases and the relative positive margin rate favouring robotic prostatectomy.  Conclusions:   Higher costs of robotic prostatectomy may be offset by modest health gain resulting from lower risk of early harms and positive margin, provided >150 cases are performed each year.

Methods:   Historical dose-response data from prostate cancer patient cohorts treated with 3D-conformal radiotherapy is used to construct TOC graphs. Next, intensity-modulated (IMRT) plans are generated by optimisation based on dosimetric criteria and dose-response relationships. TOC graphs are constructed for dose-scaling of the optimised IMRT plan and individualised dose prescription. The area under the TOC curve (AUC) is estimated to measure the therapeutic power of these plans.  Results:   On a continuous scale, the TOC graph directly visualises treatment benefit and morbidity risk of physicians' or patients' choices for dose (de-)escalation. The trade-off between these probabilities facilitates the selection of an individualised dose prescription. TOC graphs show broader therapeutic window and higher AUCs with increasing target dose heterogeneity.

To assess in these models and primary cultures, the effects of Serenoa repens (LSESr, Permixon®) on proliferation/apoptosis ratio, inflammation-related genes expression and NF-κB pathway activation.  Methods:   The expression of IL-6, CCL-5, CCL-2, COX-1, COX-2, iNOS inflammation-related genes has been evaluated at the mRNA level in two in vitro human PC models (LNCaP and PC3 cell lines) and in 40 independent human prostatic primary cultures obtained from PC patients undergoing radical prostatectomy. Tissue fragments were collected from both PC lesions and normal hyperplastic tissue counterparts for each case. All cultures were treated with two different amounts of Permixon® (44 and 88 μg/ml) for different time points (16, 24, 48 and 72 hours), depending on the cell type and the assay; the expression of inflammation-related genes, cell growth (proliferation/apoptosis ratio) and NF-κB activation has been analyzed in treated and untreated cells by means of semi-quantitative RNA-PCR, cell proliferation and immunofluorescence respectively.  Results:   We detected a significant reduction (p <0.001) in PC and normal cells proliferation due to Permixon ® treatment. This result was related to an increase of the apoptotic activity showed by an increase in the number of anti-caspase-3 fluorescent cells. Almost all the inflammation-related genes (IL-6, CCL-5, CCL-2, COX-2 and iNOS) were expressed at the basal level in in vitro cultured cells and primary cultures and down-regulated by Permixon® treatment.

To describe risk factors associated with prostate cancer mortality.  Patients and methods:   Observational study of 6489 men with localised prostate cancer treated with RP at six different hospitals in Denmark between 1995 and 2011. Survival was described using Kaplan-Meier estimates. Causes of death were obtained from the national registry and cross-checked with patient files. Cumulative incidence of death, any cause and prostate cancer-specific, was described using Nelson-Aalen estimates. Risk for prostate cancer death was analysed in a Cox multivariate regression model using the covariates: age, cT-category, PSA level and biopsy Gleason score.  Results:   The median follow-up was 4 years. During follow-up, 328 patients died, 109 (33.2%) from prostate cancer and 219 (66.8%) from other causes. Six patients (0.09%) died ≤30 days of RP. In multivariate analysis, cT-category was a predictor of prostate cancer death (P < 0.001). Compared with T1 disease, both cT2c (hazard ratio [HR] 2.2) and cT3 (HR 7.2) significantly increased the risk of prostate cancer death. For every doubling of PSA level the risk of prostate cancer death was increased by 34.8% (P < 0.001). Biopsy Gleason score 4 + 3 and ≥8 were associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer death compared with biopsy Gleason score ≤ 6 of 2.3 and 2.7 (P = 0.003), respectively. The cumulative hazard of all-cause and prostate cancer-specific mortality after 10 years was 15.4% (95% confide3nce interval [CI] 13.2-17.7) and 6.6% (95% CI 4.9-8.2) respectively.

The SVs receive lower doses of radiation from external-beam RT (EBRT) to avoid rectal exposure and are not targeted with brachytherapy (BT) with low-risk prostate cancer.  Patients and methods:   SRP was performed on 206 men with BCR after RT at a tertiary care institution between 1998 and 2011. Post-RT biopsy and SRP specimens were reviewed by a genitourinary pathologist.  Results:   SVI was detected in 65 (32%) of 206 patients. No difference was found between EBRT alone (65% vs 63%) and BT (29% vs 31%) with or without EBRT in patients with SVI. Men with SVI had higher rates of cT3 disease (20% vs 8%) and Gleason score ≥ 8 at SRP (52% vs 21%).

SATB1 silencing was achieved by stable transfection with the vectors expressing small hairpin RNA versus SATB1. Cell proliferation was detected in a microplate reader with Cell Counting Kit-8 and the cell cycle was analyzed by flow cytometry using a cell cycle detection kit. The study found that SATB1 was particularly over-expressed in human osteosarcoma U2OS. Silencing SATB1 inhibited the proliferation of U2OS. It was found that inhibition of cell proliferation resulted from cell cycle arrest due to down-regulated expression of CFGF and JunB. The over-expression of SATB1 is responsible for abnormal proliferation of mesenchymal derived human Osteosatcoma U2OS cells, indicating that silencing SATB1 expression in the cells might be developed as an efficient osteosarcoma therapy.

Furthermore, STIM1 and Orai1, along with Orai3, encode store-independent Ca(2+) currents regulated by either arachidonate or its metabolite, leukotriene C4. Orai channels are emerging as important contributors to numerous cell functions, including proliferation, migration, differentiation, and apoptosis. Recent studies suggest critical involvement of STIM/Orai proteins in controlling the development of several cancers, including malignancies of the breast, prostate, and cervix. Here, we quantitatively compared the magnitude of SOCE and the expression levels of STIM1 and Orai1 in non-malignant human primary astrocytes (HPA) and in primary human cell lines established from surgical samples of the brain tumor glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Using Ca(2+) imaging, patch-clamp electrophysiology, pharmacological reagents, and gene silencing, we established that in GBM cells, SOCE and CRAC are mediated by STIM1 and Orai1. We further found that GBM cells show upregulation of SOCE and increased Orai1 levels compared to HPA. The functional significance of SOCE was evaluated by studying the effects of STIM1 and Orai1 knockdown on cell proliferation and invasion. Utilizing Matrigel assays, we demonstrated that in GBM, but not in HPA, downregulation of STIM1 and Orai1 caused a dramatic decrease in cell invasion. In contrast, the effects of STIM1 and Orai1 knockdown on GBM cell proliferation were marginal. Overall, these results demonstrate that STIM1 and Orai1 encode SOCE and CRAC currents and control invasion of GBM cells.

It exhibits both tumor suppressor and tumor-promoting activities. Correlations between cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 overexpression and enhanced production of prostaglandin (PG)E2 have been implicated in cancer progression; however, there are no studies indicating that TGF-β effects in prostate cancer cells involve PGE2 synthesis. In this study, we investigated TGF-β regulation of COX-1 and COX-2 expression in prostate cancer cells and whether the effects of TGF-β on cell proliferation and migration are mediated by PGE2. COX-1 protein was ubiquitously expressed in prostate cells; however, COX-2 protein levels were detected only in prostate cancer cells. TGF-β treatment increased COX-2 protein levels and PGE2 secretion in PC3 cells. Exogenous PGE2 and PGF2α had no effects on cell proliferation in LNCaP, DU145, and PC3 cells whereas PGE2 and TGF-β induced migration and invasive behavior in PC3 cells. Only EP2 and EP4 receptors were detected at mRNA levels in prostate cells. The EP4-targeting small interfering RNA inhibited PGE2 and TGF-β-induced migration of PC3 cells. TGF-β and PGE2 induce activation of PI3K/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin pathway as indicated by increased AKT, p70S6K, and S6 phosphorylation. Rapamycin completely blocked the effects of TGF-β and PGE2 on phosphorylation of p70S6K and S6 but not on AKT phosphorylation. PGE2 and TGF-β induced phosphorylation of AKT, which was blocked by antagonists of PGE2 (EP4) receptors (L161982, AH23848) and PI3K inhibitor (LY294002) in PC3 cells. Pretreatment with L161982 or AH23848 blocked the stimulatory effects of PGE2 and TGF-β on cell migration, whereas LY294002 or rapamycin completely eliminated PGE2, TGF-β, and epidermal growth factor-induced migration in PC3 cells. We conclude that TGF-β increases COX-2 levels and PGE2 secretion in prostate cancer cells which, in turn, mediate TGF-β effects on cell migration and invasion through the activation of PI3K/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin pathway.""","""['Baohan T Vo', 'Derrick Morton Jr', 'Shravan Komaragiri', 'Ana C Millena', 'Chelesie Leath', 'Shafiq A Khan']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Endocrinology""","""['Differential role of PTEN in transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) effects on proliferation and migration in prostate cancer cells.', 'Prostaglandin E2-Induced COX-2 Expressions via EP2 and EP4 Signaling Pathways in Human LoVo Colon Cancer Cells.', 'Prostaglandin E2 receptor EP4 is involved in the cell growth and invasion of prostate cancer via the cAMP‑PKA/PI3K‑Akt signaling pathway.', 'The PI3K-AKT-mTOR Pathway and Prostate Cancer: At the Crossroads of AR, MAPK, and WNT Signaling.', 'PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling in prostate cancer progression and androgen deprivation therapy resistance.', 'Specific prostaglandins are produced in the migratory cells and the surrounding substrate to promote Drosophila border cell migration.', 'Integrated pancancer analysis reveals the oncogene characteristics and prognostic value of DIP2B in breast cancer.', 'Genistein promotes apoptosis of lung cancer cells through the IMPDH2/AKT1 pathway.', 'FAM107A Inactivation Associated with Promoter Methylation Affects Prostate Cancer Progression through the FAK/PI3K/AKT Pathway.', 'Myricetin induces apoptosis and autophagy in human gastric cancer cells through inhibition of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway.']"""

Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in β-carotene 15,15'-monooxygenase 1 (BCMO1), a gene encoding the enzyme involved in the first step of synthesizing vitamin A from dietary carotenoids, have been associated with circulating carotenoid concentrations and may serve as unconfounded surrogates for those biomarkers. We determined associations between variants in BCMO1 and breast cancer risk in a large cohort consortium.  Methods:   We used unconditional logistic regression to test four SNPs in BCMO1 for associations with breast cancer risk in 9,226 cases and 10,420 controls from the National Cancer Institute Breast and Prostate Cancer Cohort Consortium (BPC3). We also tested weighted multi-SNP scores composed of the two SNPs with strong, confirmed associations with circulating carotenoid concentrations.

It is found in about 80% of the patients receiving radiation therapy and has a significant impact on quality of life. The aim of this paper was to assess the frequency, severity and changes of fatigue before, during and after administration of a nutraceutical (mixture of whey protein with an high biological value, with an high content in native cysteine, albumin and lactoferrin in patients undergoing treatment for breast and prostate cancer.  Methods:   Thirty patients (20 breast and 10 prostate ones) were enrolled in our test and they received a questionnaire about Fatigue developed by the University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1999. The patients who achieved a score between 4 and 6 were administered the nutraceutical (Prother) at a dose of 20 g / day for the first 10 days of radiation treatment and then 10 g/day for the following 20 days without considering the terms of the radiation oncology treatment [corrected]. Each patient was reassessed using the same Fatigue test after 10 and 30 days from the start of the administration of nutraceutical. We enrolled 30 control patients who did not receive Prother.

Although useful for scientific purposes, QOL questionnaires may be too extensive for daily routine, and single questions or interview-assessed outcomes may be more practical alternatives. The QOL outcomes of these measures were compared.  Materials and methods:   The QOL of patients undergoing Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy (RARP) in our hospital was monitored before and after treatment using both brief standardized interview questions, as well as more extensive validated questionnaires. The interview questions address erectile function and urinary continence with only one question on each subject (both four response items). Questionnaires included a total of 74 questions (EORTC-QLQ-C30, EORTC-QLQ-PR25, international index of erectile function-15, and international consultation on incontinence questionnaire-short form).  Results:   In 925 RARP patients, pre- and postoperative interview and questionnaire QOL data were available with a median follow up of 20 months. Improvement in both erectile function and continence scores occurred up till 2 years after the RARP for both interview- and questionnaire-based evaluations. On an individual patient basis, interview scores poorly correlated with questionnaire-based domains for continence and erectile function. Single questions from the questionnaire showed better correlation with domain scores. Functional recovery of continence after 1 year was worse when assessed by questionnaire than by interview evaluation. A decrease in physical (8%) and overall QOL (12%) after prostatectomy as assessed by the EORTC-QLQ-C30 questionnaire was better predicted by questionnaire-based than interview-based scores. Continence scores had a greater impact on physical and overall QOL scores than on erectile function scores.  Conclusion:   Interview/assessed continence and erectile function outcome after RARP showed limited association with questionnaire-based evaluation and may overestimate functional recovery. Continence scores for both interviews and questionnaires were stronger correlated with physical and overall QOL than erectile function scores.""","""['Henk G van der Poel', 'Corinne Tillier', 'Willem M de Blok', 'Cenk Acar', 'Erik H A M van Muilekom', 'Roderick C N van den Bergh']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Endourol""","""['Validated Prospective Assessment of Quality of Life After Robot-Assisted Laparoscopic Prostatectomy: Beyond Continence and Erections.', 'Impact on quality of life of radical prostatectomy after initial active surveillance: more to lose?', 'Short- and Long-term Functional Outcomes and Quality of Life after Radical Prostatectomy: Patient-reported Outcomes from a Tertiary High-volume Center.', 'Systematic review and meta-analysis of studies reporting urinary continence recovery after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Patient-reported outcome (PRO) questionnaires for men who have radical surgery for prostate cancer: a conceptual review of existing instruments.', 'Advanced Reconstruction of Vesicourethral Support May Improve Urinary Continence and Quality of Life After Non-nerve-sparing Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Changes in quality of life and lower urinary tract symptoms over time in cancer patients after a total prostatectomy: systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Functional outcomes rather than complications predict poor health-related quality of life at 6\xa0months after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Intravesical prostatic protrusion may affect early postoperative continence undergoing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Do rapid emotional thermometers correlate with multidimensional validated structured questionnaires in low-risk prostate cancer?']"""

Here the authors examine the antimetastatic potential of NAC on the metastasis of human prostate cancer cells.  Material and method:   Cytotoxicity of NAC to human prostate cancer cells, DU145 and PC3, were determined by proliferation assay using the 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol, 2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) reagent. Cell migration and invasion were assessed by using a chemotaxis chamber containing membrane pre-coated with collagen IV and Matrigel, respectively. Cell attachment onto the surface of the membrane coated with collagen IV was tested for its adhesion potentiality.  Results:   NAC could inhibit the growth of DU145 and PC3 cells. Suppression of migration and invasion of both human prostrate cancer cells were observed. Cell attachment to the collagen IV-coated surface was obviously reduced. All inhibitions occurred in a dose-dependent fashion in both cell lines.  Conclusion:   NAC could have a high potential in attenuating the migration of the human prostate cancer cells from their primary site and their adhesion and invasion to the remote locations. Hence, NAC might suppress the growth of the primary and the secondary tumors. Our findings suggest that NAC had a high possibility to become an antimetastatic agent for testing in clinical trials. Then, NAC might be used clinically as an optional adjuvant therapeutic drug in addition to the conventional standard treatment of human prostate cancer, obtaining a better outcome with the least toxic and affordable substance.""","""['Athikom Supabphol', 'Roongtawan Supabphol']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""J Med Assoc Thai""","""['N-acetylcysteine inhibits proliferation, adhesion, migration and invasion of human bladder cancer cells.', 'Phenylethyl isothiocyanate and its N-acetylcysteine conjugate suppress the metastasis of SK-Hep1 human hepatoma cells.', 'N-acetyl cysteine inhibits human signet ring cell gastric cancer cell line (SJ-89) cell growth by inducing apoptosis and DNA synthesis arrest.', 'Effects of phenylethyl isothiocyanate and its metabolite on cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis in LNCaP human prostate cancer cells.', 'The role of the thiol N-acetylcysteine in the prevention of tumor invasion and angiogenesis.', 'N-Acetylcysteine Promotes Metastatic Spread of Melanoma in Mice.', 'The Crosstalk between Prostate Cancer and Microbiota Inflammation: Nutraceutical Products Are Useful to Balance This Interplay?', 'Inflammatory mechanisms and oxidative stress in prostatitis: the possible role of antioxidant therapy.', 'Alterations in Sod2-Induced Oxidative Stress Affect Endocrine Cancer Progression.', 'Convergent Effects of Resveratrol and PYK2 on Prostate Cells.']"""

However, research on other personality constructs is inconclusive. This longitudinal study examined the associations between four personality measures, Type 1, ""suppressed emotional expression""; Type 5, ""rational/antiemotional""; hostility; and Type A with cancer incidence.  Methods:   Personality measures were available for 13,768 members in the GAZEL cohort study (baseline assessment in 1993). Follow-up for diagnoses of primary cancers was obtained from January 1, 1994 to December 31, 2009. Associations between personality and cancer incidence were evaluated using Cox proportional hazards analyses and adjusted for potential confounders.  Results:   During a median follow-up of 16.0 years (range, 9 days-16 years), 1139 participants were diagnosed as having a primary cancer. The mean duration between baseline and cancer diagnosis was 9.3 years. Type 1 personality was associated with a decreased risk of breast cancer (hazard ratio per standard deviation = 0.81, 95% confidence interval = 0.68-0.97, p = .02). Type 5 personality was not associated with prostate, breast, colorectal, or smoking-related cancers, but was associated with other cancers (hazard ratio per standard deviation = 1.17, 95% confidence interval = 1.04-1.31, p = .01). Hostility was associated with an increased risk of smoking-related cancers, which was explained by smoking habits, and Type A was not associated with any of the cancer endpoints.

Methods:   We conducted a nested case-control study (209 cases, 410 controls) of RCC risk in relation to prediagnostic leukocyte telomere length in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial.

Conclusions:   The results of this study, to our knowledge the first prospective investigation of its kind, do not support an association between prediagnostic leukocyte telomere length and risk of RCC.

Tocopherols are the predominant form of vitamin E found in the diet and in supplements and have garnered interest for their potential cancer therapeutic and preventive effects, such as the dephosphorylation of Akt, a serine/threonine kinase with a pivotal role in cell growth, survival, and metabolism. Dephosphorylation of Akt at Ser473 substantially reduces its catalytic activity and inhibits downstream signaling. We found that the mechanism by which α-tocopherol and γ-tocopherol facilitate this site-specific dephosphorylation of Akt was mediated through the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain-dependent recruitment of Akt and PHLPP1 (PH domain leucine-rich repeat protein phosphatase, isoform 1) to the plasma membrane. We structurally optimized these tocopherols to obtain derivatives with greater in vitro potency and in vivo tumor-suppressive activity in two prostate xenograft tumor models. Binding affinities for the PH domains of Akt and PHLPP1 were greater than for other PH domain-containing proteins, which may underlie the preferential recruitment of these proteins to membranes containing tocopherols. Molecular modeling revealed the structural determinants of the interaction with the PH domain of Akt that may inform strategies for continued structural optimization. By describing a mechanism by which tocopherols facilitate the dephosphorylation of Akt at Ser473, we provide insights into the mode of antitumor action of tocopherols and a rationale for the translational development of tocopherols into novel PH domain-targeted Akt inhibitors.""","""['Po-Hsien Huang', 'Hsiao-Ching Chuang', 'Chih-Chien Chou', 'Huiling Wang', 'Su-Lin Lee', 'Hsiao-Ching Yang', 'Hao-Chieh Chiu', 'Naval Kapuriya', 'Dasheng Wang', 'Samuel K Kulp', 'Ching-Shih Chen']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Sci Signal""","""['Exploitation of the ability of γ-tocopherol to facilitate membrane co-localization of Akt and PHLPP1 to develop PHLPP1-targeted Akt inhibitors.', 'PHLPP is a negative regulator of RAF1, which reduces colorectal cancer cell motility and prevents tumor progression in mice.', 'Heat shock protein 47 promotes tumor survival and therapy resistance by modulating AKT signaling via PHLPP1 in colorectal cancer.', 'PHLiPPing the switch on Akt and protein kinase C signaling.', 'Turning off AKT: PHLPP as a drug target.', 'Targeting Reactive Oxygen Species Capacity of Tumor Cells with Repurposed Drug as an Anticancer Therapy.', 'α-Tocopherol Attenuates Oxidative Phosphorylation of CD34+ Cells, Enhances Their G0 Phase Fraction and Promotes Hematopoietic Stem and Primitive Progenitor Cell Maintenance.', 'Vitamin E beyond Its Antioxidant Label.', 'δ-Tocopherol inhibits the development of prostate adenocarcinoma in prostate specific Pten-/- mice.', 'α-Tocopherol and Hippocampal Neural Plasticity in Physiological and Pathological Conditions.']"""

Chromosomal rearrangements involving ETS transcription factors, such as ERG and ETV1, occur frequently in prostate cancer. How they contribute to tumorigenesis and whether they play similar or distinct in vivo roles remain elusive. Here we show that in mice with ERG or ETV1 targeted to the endogenous Tmprss2 locus, either factor cooperated with loss of a single copy of Pten, leading to localized cancer, but only ETV1 appeared to support development of invasive adenocarcinoma under the background of full Pten loss. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that ERG and ETV1 control a common transcriptional network but largely in an opposing fashion. In particular, while ERG negatively regulates the androgen receptor (AR) transcriptional program, ETV1 cooperates with AR signaling by favoring activation of the AR transcriptional program. Furthermore, we found that ETV1 expression, but not that of ERG, promotes autonomous testosterone production. Last, we confirmed the association of an ETV1 expression signature with aggressive disease and poorer outcome in patient data. The distinct biology of ETV1-associated prostate cancer suggests that this disease class may require new therapies directed to underlying programs controlled by ETV1.""","""['Esther Baena', 'Zhen Shao', 'Douglas E Linn', 'Kimberly Glass', 'Melanie J Hamblen', 'Yuko Fujiwara', 'Jonghwan Kim', 'Minh Nguyen', 'Xin Zhang', 'Frank J Godinho', 'Roderick T Bronson', 'Lorelei A Mucci', 'Massimo Loda', 'Guo-Cheng Yuan', 'Stuart H Orkin', 'Zhe Li']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Genes Dev""","""['Commentary on ""ETV1 directs androgen metabolism and confers aggressive prostate cancer in targeted mice and patients.""

However, the question which factors in dental and oral health are relevant has not been answered completely.  Materials and methods:   In a retrospective study, 50 patients who were treated with BRONJ between 2000 and 2009 were analyzed. As underlying diseases, they suffered from breast cancer (n = 24), multiple myeloma (n = 16), prostate cancer (n = 5), osteoporosis (n = 4), and kidney cancer (n = 1). The data were collected from the patient charts of the treating dentists, oral and maxillofacial surgeons, general practitioners, and oncologists. The time of occurrence of BRONJ after treatment onset with bisphosphonates (BP) was examined with Kaplan-Meier estimator and logrank test (level of significance 0.05).  Results:   At the time of BP treatment, onset the decayed, missing, and filled teeth (DMFT) index was 20.5 ± 4.2. Patients with a DMFT value less than 20 showed a significantly longer BRONJ-free time interval after BP treatment onset with 39.7 ± 1.1 months compared to patients with a DMFT value higher than 20, in whom BRONJ appeared after 14.4 ± 2.8 months (p < 0.001). However, the DMFT value had no influence on the success rate of BRONJ treatment. As a pre-existing oral disease, 60 % of the patients (n = 30) had marginal periodontitis; 38 % (n = 19), apical periodontitis; and 22 % (n = 11), a pressure lesion from their dentures. In patients with marginal periodontitis, BRONJ occurred after 26.3 months (range 20.9-31.3) and in patients without marginal periodontitis, after 27.4 months (range 14.6-40.1) (p = 0.58). Only 20 % of the patients with marginal periodontitis received adequate treatment.

Methods:   Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected longitudinal data of 492 RALPs performed by a single surgeon (Kane) over a 5-year period. Patients are subdivided into three treatment groups: 54 EPLND; 231 SPLND; and 207 non-PLND. Indications for EPLND include Gleason score ≥ 8, PSA ≥ 10 ng/mL, and higher D'Amico risk group. Patient demographics, perioperative complications, and short-term oncologic outcomes are compared.  Results:   Patients who underwent EPLND had higher-risk prostate cancer as evidenced by higher mean PSA (8.5 ng/mL), biopsy Gleason sum (≥ 8) (57.7 %), and D'Amico risk group (75.9 %), compared to SPLND and/or non-PLND groups (p ≤ 0.001). The EPLND total lymph node yield was similar compared to SPLND (20 vs. 18; p = 0.070). When the EPLND (n = 41) and SPLND (n = 57) were examined among only high-risk patients, the lymph node (IQR) yields [20 (14-29) vs. 17 (12-23)] and the proportion of positive nodes [29.3 % (12/41) vs. 12.3 % (7/57)] differed significantly (p = 0.048 and p = 0.042, respectively). Complication rates for all groups were similar and lymphocele formation was 5 %; 2.5 % were clinically significant.  Conclusions:   Robotic PLND can be performed with nodal yield comparable to open or laparoscopic PLND. Robotic EPLND improves nodal yield and the proportion of high-risk patients with nodal metastases recognized. Robotic PLND is associated with an approximately 5 % lymphocele rate.

Cytometric evaluation of tumor ploidy status was recently suggested as a prognostic marker. However, in prostate cancer (PCa), a chromosome-specific evaluation is lacking. With the present study, we sought to identify distinct chromosomal changes to complement cytometric results concerning the diagnosis and prognosis of PCa patients.  Methods:   We assessed a cohort of 428 PCa specimens (186 localized PCa, 75 lymph node metastasized PCa, 125 lymph node metastases, 42 hormone-refractory distant metastases) for numerical alterations of all 24 chromosomes by using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Conducting immunohistochemistry with phosphorylated histone H3 (PHH3) and Ki-67, we quantified the proliferation rate. FISH results were fit in a linear model and tested for predictive power.  Results:   As expected, we observed a significant increase in aneuploidy with advancing tumor stage. Similarly, an increased expression of the mitotic marker PHH3 was significantly associated with aneuploidy and higher pT-stage. We found aneusomy of chromosomes 4, 6, 20, and X to be indicative of lymph node metastasized PCa. However, with an AUC of 65%, this set of chromosomal changes was poorly suited to distinguish non-metastasized and lymph node metastasized primary tumors.  Conclusion:   Our results provide thorough insight into the so far incompletely elucidated chromosomal landscape of PCa. While overall ploidy status and PHH3 expression in primary tumors indicate advanced disease, a FISH-based test for distinct alterations does not seem to be beneficial for diagnostic or prognostic decisions.""","""['Martin Braun', 'Julia Stomper', 'Robert Kirsten', 'David Adler', 'Wenzel Vogel', 'Diana Böhm', 'Nicolas Wernert', 'Glen Kristiansen', 'Sven Perner']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""World J Urol""","""['Interphase cytogenetics of prostatic tumor progression: specific chromosomal abnormalities are involved in metastasis to the bone.', 'Loss of p53 and c-myc overrepresentation in stage T(2-3)N(1-3)M(0) prostate cancer are potential markers for cancer progression.', 'Upregulation of Talin-1 expression associates with advanced pathological features and predicts lymph node metastases and biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer.', 'The prognostic and predictive value of TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion and ERG protein expression in prostate cancer biopsies.', 'Prognostic significance of DNA ploidy in oral squamous cell carcinomas.

Results:   In contrast to the classical Kunitz plant inhibitor SbTI, the recombinant kallikrein inhibitor (rBbKIm) led to prostate cancer cell death, whereas fibroblast viability was not affected.  Conclusion:   rBbKIm shows selective cytotoxic effect and angiogenesis inhibition against prostate cancer cells.  Significance:   New actions of rBbKIm may contribute to understanding the mechanisms of prostate cancer. Prostate cancer is the most common type of cancer, and kallikreins play an important role in the establishment of this disease. rBbKIm is the recombinant Bauhinia bauhinioides kallikreins inhibitor that was modified to include the RGD/RGE motifs of the inhibitor BrTI from Bauhinia rufa. This work reports the effects of rBbKIm on DU145 and PC3 prostate cancer cell lines. rBbKIm inhibited the cell viability of DU145 and PC3 cells but did not affect the viability of fibroblasts. rBbKIm caused an arrest of the PC3 cell cycle at the G0/G1 and G2/M phases but did not affect the DU145 cell cycle, although rBbKIm triggers apoptosis and cytochrome c release into the cytosol of both cell types. The differences in caspase activation were observed because rBbKIm treatment promoted activation of caspase-3 in DU145 cells, whereas caspase-9 but not caspase-3 was activated in PC3 cells. Because angiogenesis is important to the development of a tumor, the effect of rBbKIm in this process was also analyzed, and an inhibition of 49% was observed in in vitro endothelial cell capillary-like tube network formation.

Lenalidomide (Revlimid) is an immunomodulatory analog of thalidomide with significant T-cell stimulatory and antiangiogenic properties. GM-CSF in combination with thalidomide induces prostate-specific antigen (PSA) responses in 20% to 25% of patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). In an effort to further evaluate the clinical and immune activity of GM-CSF and lenalidomide, we conducted a phase I-II trial in patients with CRPC.  Methods:   Asymptomatic patients with CRPC were enrolled. Prior immunotherapy or chemotherapy was not allowed. All the patients received 250 μg of GM-CSF administered subcutaneously 3 times weekly along with 25mg/d of lenalidomide administered orally on days 1 to 21 of a 28-day cycle. The primary end points were objective, PSA response, and safety. Exploratory end points included activation of circulating DCs, regulatory T cells, and Th1 cytokine production.  Results:   Thirty-two patients were enrolled in the study. No dose-limiting toxicities occurred in the phase I portion of the study. Although 81% of the patients achieved a decline in the levels of PSA while on therapy, only 4 achieved a PSA level decline of ≥ 50%. The overall response rate among 11 patients with response evaluation criteria in solid tumors-defined measurable disease was 18%. Overall toxicity was G1 and G2 in nature and included fatigue observed in 69% of the patients, nausea/vomiting in 34%, and diarrhea in 28% of the patients.

Postimplant dosimetry was performed in 18 consecutively implanted patients with prostate cancer. Two were implanted with the 9011 source and 16 with the 6711 source. For purposes of comparison, each implant was then recalculated assuming use of the other source. The same commercially available planning system was used and the specific source data for both 6711 and 9011 products were entered. The results of these calculations are compared side by side in the terms of the isodose values covering 100% (D100) and 90% (D90) of prostate volume, and the percentages of volumes of prostate, bladder, rectum, and urethra covered by 200% (V200), 150% (V150), 100% (V100), 50% (V50), and 20% (V20) of the prescribed dose as well. The 6711 source data overestimate coverage by 6.4% (ranging from 4.9% to 6.9%; median 6.6%) at D100 and by 6.6% (ranging from 6.2% to 6.8%; median 6.6%) at D90 compared with actual 9011 data. Greater discrepancies of up to 67% are seen at higher dose levels: average reduction for V100 is 2.7% (ranging from 0.6% to 7.7%; median 2.3%), for V150 is 14.6% (ranging from 6.1% to 20.5%; median 15.3%), for V200 is 14.9% (ranging from 4.8% to 19.1%; median 16%); similarly seen in bladder, rectal, and urethral coverage.

The aim of this study was to assess recovery of continence and erectile function after laparoscopic extraperitoneal radical prostatectomy comparing two surgical devices for dissection and hemostasis-radiofrequency (RF) and ultrasound (US) scalpels.  Patients and methods:   A total of 132 men with localized prostate cancer were prospectively enrolled and scheduled for extraperitoneal LRP. Patients were randomly assigned to the RF group (LigaSure; n=66) or the US group (UltraCision; n=66).

All conjugates were purified by semipreparative high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and characterized by electrospray ionization (ESI) and matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) and NMR spectroscopy. The cytotoxicity of the compounds was tested in MCF-7 (breast) and DU-145 (prostate) human cancer cells, as well as in the normal HEK293 (Human Embryonic Kidney) cell line, revealing a dependence on the nature of the glycoside moiety and the type of cell (cancer or healthy). Indeed, the neomycin-ruthenium conjugate (2) displayed moderate antiproliferative activity in both cancer cell lines (IC50 ≈ 80 μM), whereas the neamine conjugate (4) was inactive (IC50 ≈ 200 μM). However, the guanidinylated analogue of the neomycin-ruthenium conjugate (3) required much lower concentrations than the parent conjugate for equal effect (IC50 = 7.17 μM in DU-145 and IC50 = 11.33 μM in MCF-7). Although the same ranking in antiproliferative activity was found in the nontumorigenic cell line (3 ≫ 2 > 4), IC50 values indicate that aminoglycoside-containing conjugates are about 2-fold more cytotoxic in normal cells (e.g., IC50 = 49.4 μM for 2) than in cancer cells, whereas an opposite tendency was found with the guanidinylated conjugate, since its cytotoxicity in the normal cell line (IC50 = 12.75 μM for 3) was similar or even lower than that found in MCF-7 and DU-145 cancer cell lines, respectively. Cell uptake studies performed by ICP-MS with conjugates 2 and 3 revealed that guanidinylation of the neomycin moiety had a positive effect on accumulation (about 3-fold higher in DU-145 and 4-fold higher in HEK293), which correlates well with the higher antiproliferative activity of 3. Interestingly, despite the slightly higher accumulation in the normal cell than in the cancer cell line (about 1.4-fold), guanidinoneomycin-ruthenium conjugate (3) was more cytotoxic to cancer cells (about 1.8-fold), whereas the opposite tendency applied for neomycin-ruthenium conjugate (2). Such differences in cytotoxic activity and cellular accumulation between cancer and normal cells open the way to the creation of more selective, less toxic anticancer metallodrugs by conjugating cytotoxic metal-based complexes such as ruthenium(II) arene derivatives to guanidinoglycosides.""","""['Ariadna Grau-Campistany', 'Anna Massaguer', 'Dolors Carrion-Salip', 'Flavia Barragán', 'Gerard Artigas', 'Paula López-Senín', 'Virtudes Moreno', 'Vicente Marchán']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Mol Pharm""","""['Transferrin serves as a mediator to deliver organometallic ruthenium(II) anticancer complexes into cells.', 'Anticancer activity of ruthenium(II) arene complexes bearing 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline amino alcohol ligands.', 'Dual-targeting organometallic ruthenium(II) anticancer complexes bearing EGFR-inhibiting 4-anilinoquinazoline ligands.', 'Design of Ru-arene Complexes for Antitumor Drugs.', 'Organometallic chemistry, biology and medicine: ruthenium arene anticancer complexes.', ""Synthesis of new N,N'-Pd(Pt) complexes based on sulfanyl pyrazoles, and investigation of their in vitro anticancer activity."", 'Synthesis of New Cu Complex Based on Natural 5Z,9Z-Eicosadienoic Acid: Effective Topoisomerase I Inhibitor and Cytotoxin against the Cisplatin-Resistant Cell Line.', 'Targeting the mitochondrial VDAC in hepatocellular carcinoma using a polyclonal antibody-conjugated to a nitrosyl ruthenium complex.', 'Comprehensive review of chemical strategies for the preparation of new aminoglycosides and their biological activities.', 'Synthesis, characterization, in vitro cytotoxicity, and apoptosis-inducing properties of ruthenium(II) complexes.']"""

Patients and methods:   We evaluated 5274 PCa patients treated with radical prostatectomy and anatomically extended pelvic lymph node dissection (ePLND) between 1990 and 2010. Year-per-year trends of clinical and pathological characteristics were examined. Logistic regression analyses addressed predictors of pN1.  Results:   The median number of lymph nodes (LNs) removed was 16.0. Overall, the pN1 rate was 13.8% and it decreased from 26.1% to 15.6% between 1990 and 2010 (P < 0.001). For the same period, the pN1 rate changed from 0% to 3% in the low-risk PCa, from 20% to 7% in the intermediate-risk PCa, and from 33% to 44% in the high-risk PCa (P ≤ 0.01). In pN1 patients, pre-operative cancer characteristics and the median number of positive LNs (three in 1990 versus two in 2010) did not significantly change overtime (all P ≥ 0.1).

Using conditional logistic regression, odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for prostate cancer risk were estimated according to quintiles of serum folate, vitamin B12, methylmalonic acid (MMA), total homocysteine (tHcy) and methionine, and according to MTHFR 677C→T genotypes. To correct for degradation during sample storage, folate concentration was measured as p-aminobenzoylglutamate (pABG) equivalents following oxidation and acid hydrolysis.  Results:   We observed a weak positive association between folate concentration and prostate cancer risk [OR highest vs lowest quintile = 1.15 (0.97-1.37), P-trend = 0.04], which was more pronounced among individuals ≥ 50 years at inclusion [OR 1.40 (1.07-1.84), P-trend = 0.02]. tHcy showed an inverse trend with risk [OR 0.92 (0.77-1.10), P-trend = 0.03].

To complement the established markers like e.g. PCA3-a noncoding mRNA sequence-and PSA-a serine protease-we investigated the ectopically expressed G-protein coupled olfactory receptor OR1D2 as a possible target for prostate-specific detection with its agonist bourgeonal which has been conjugated to two different fluorescent dyes. We performed mRNA expression analysis of the OR1D2 receptor mRNA by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction on LNCaP prostate carcinoma cells and three other non-prostate derived carcinoma cell lines. Additionally, we used flow cytometry to investigate the uptake of fluorescent-dye-bound OR1D2-ligand bourgeonal into the examined carcinoma cell lines. Finally, confocal laser scanning microscopy of in vitro cell culture and in vivo tumor xenografts on mice was performed. We could confirm OR1D2 receptor mRNA overexpression as well as stronger uptake of both bourgeonal conjugates in vitro and in vivo for LNCaP cells compared to the non-prostate derived cell lines. Cytoplasmic accumulation and no adverse effects after in vitro and in vivo application of the conjugates were observed.

Background:   Gastroesophageal reflux disease has been reported to be associated with upper aerodigestive malignancies. BE is considered a consequence of long-standing gastroesophageal reflux disease; however, the association of BE with extraesophageal malignancies is controversial.  Study:   The database of the largest health service provider in Israel was queried for all patients diagnosed with BE between 2000 and 2010. Data regarding medical background and diagnosis of malignancy were recorded. Malignancy rates were compared with subjects without BE or malignancy and matched for age, sex, and smoking status (1:4 ratio). Patients in whom a malignancy was diagnosed within 1 year of BE diagnosis were excluded.  Results:   A total of 3669 patients with BE and 14,676 controls were included. Several nonesophageal malignancies were significantly more prevalent among BE patients: colorectal cancer (relative risk 1.98, P<0.001) and prostate cancer (relative risk 1.99, P<0.001), but not cancer of the upper aerodigestive tract. Multivariate analysis revealed that Jewish origin and the presence of BE were associated with higher malignancy risk [hazard ratio (HR) 1.83, HR 1.41, respectively; P<0.001]; body mass index was inversely associated with malignancy risk (HR 0.98; P<0.005).

This study tested the hypothesis that PXD101, a potent pan histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, may prevent onset of castration-resistant phenotype and potentiate hormonal therapy. A panel of human prostate cancer cells with graded castration-resistant phenotype and in vivo models were used to verify this hypothesis. In this report, we demonstrated that hormonal manipulation favors the onset of castration-resistant phenotype increasing HDAC expression and activity as well as modulating expression and activity of AR, EGFR, HER2, and Akt. Consistent with these observations, the functional knockdown of HDACs by PXD101 prevented the onset of castration-resistant phenotype with a significant downregulation of AR, EGFR, HER2, and Akt expression/activity. The dysregulation of functional cooperation between HDAC6 with hsp90, on the one hand, and between GSK-3β with CRM1, on the other hand, may explain the biological effects of PXD101. In this regard, the HDAC6 silencing or the functional knockdown of hsp90 by 17AAG resulted in the selective downregulation of AR, EGFR, HER2, and Akt expression/activity, while the decreased phosphorylation of GSK-3β mediated by PXD101 increased the nuclear expression of CRM1, which in turn modified the AR and survivin recycling with increased caspase 3 activity.

Methods:   To better understand what components were most helpful, we analyzed user logs of breast and prostate cancer patients who participated in the experimental arm of an RCT to test effects of WebChoice on clinical outcomes. Patients could freely use the system for one year.

Also, patients used different WebChoice components for different reasons. The e-mail communication with nurses was valued highest.  Discussion:   Differences were found between breast and prostate cancer patients and between patients with a first time diagnosis and metastases or recurrences. The large variations among patients in their use of WebChoice components demonstrate that patients' needs for support vary.

Results:   In the 32 patients a medium of 7,5 zones were biopsied (range 6-9) with a total of 239 zones studied. There were identified a medium of 3.2 zones with suspicious areas (ZS) with HS (range 2-5) with a total of 103 ZS. In 72 zones of 25 patients it was found adenocarcinoma or PIN (2 PIN, 11 score Gleason 6, 7 score Gleason 7, 3 score Gleason 8 and 2 score Gleason 9). There were 35 positive false zones in 20 patients (11 normal parenquima and 9 chronic inflammation). Negative falses were produced in 5 zones in 5 patients (2PIN, 2 score Gleason 6 and 1 score Gleason 7) although in all 5 cases adenocarcinoma was encountered (o discovered) in other zones. The HS presented a sensibility of a 93.5% with a specificity of 79.5%. The positive predictive value was of the 67.35% with a negative predictive value of 96.5%.  Conclusions:   In spite of being a selected serie, with a high rate of patients with adenocarcinoma, the exploration with HS has presented a great sensibility and a high negative predictive value. These data, although they must be confirmed in less selected series, state that the prior exploration with HS can help as in the diagnostic in the biopsies as in the follow-up of programs of active surveillance.""","""['C Núñez-Mora', 'J M García-Mediero', 'P Patiño', 'C Orellana', 'A Garrido', 'A Rojo', 'D Rendón']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Actas Urol Esp""","""['Extensive repeat transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy in patients with previous benign sextant biopsies.', 'Evaluation of prostate needle biopsies in a population-based screening study: the impact of borderline lesions.', 'The role of a standardized 36 core template-assisted transperineal prostate biopsy technique in patients with previously negative transrectal ultrasonography-guided prostate biopsies.', 'Transrectal ultrasound-guided punch biopsies of the prostate.

It also explores the roles and unique challenges of long-distance caregivers, as well as interventions that target those challenges. An estimated 5.2 million Americans have AD. Approximately 200,000 people younger than 65 years with AD comprise the younger onset AD population; 5 million comprise the older onset AD population. Throughout the coming decades, the baby boom generation is projected to add about 10 million to the total number of people in the United States with AD. Today, someone in America develops AD every 68 seconds. By 2050, one new case of AD is expected to develop every 33 seconds, or nearly a million new cases per year, and the total estimated prevalence is expected to be 13.8 million. AD is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States and the fifth leading cause of death in Americans age 65 years or older. Between 2000 and 2010, the proportion of deaths resulting from heart disease, stroke, and prostate cancer decreased 16%, 23%, and 8%, respectively, whereas the proportion resulting from AD increased 68%. The number of deaths from AD as determined by official death certificates (83,494 in 2010) likely underrepresents the number of AD-related deaths in the United States. A projected 450,000 older Americans with AD will die in 2013, and a large proportion will die as a result of complications of AD. In 2012, more than 15 million family members and other unpaid caregivers provided an estimated 17.5 billion hours of care to people with AD and other dementias, a contribution valued at more than $216 billion. Medicare payments for services to beneficiaries age 65 years and older with AD and other dementias are three times as great as payments for beneficiaries without these conditions, and Medicaid payments are 19 times as great. Total payments in 2013 for health care, long-term care, and hospice services for people age 65 years and older with dementia are expected to be $203 billion (not including the contributions of unpaid caregivers). An estimated 2.3 million caregivers of people with AD and other dementias live at least 1 hour away from the care recipient. These ""long-distance caregivers"" face unique challenges, including difficulty in assessing the care recipient's true health condition and needs, high rates of family disagreement regarding caregiving decisions, and high out-of-pocket expenses for costs related to caregiving. Out-of-pocket costs for long-distance caregivers are almost twice as high as for local caregivers.""","""[""Alzheimer's Association""]""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Alzheimers Dement""","""[""2014 Alzheimer's disease facts and figures."", ""2012 Alzheimer's disease facts and figures."", ""2015 Alzheimer's disease facts and figures."", ""The costs of Alzheimer's disease and the value of effective therapies."", ""Prevalence, costs, and treatment of Alzheimer's disease and related dementia: a managed care perspective."", 'Neuroprotective effects of coenzyme Q10 on neurological diseases: a review article.', 'The PERK pathway: beneficial or detrimental for neurodegenerative diseases and tumor growth and cancer.', ""A Novel Longitudinal Phenotype-Genotype Association Study Based on Deep Feature Extraction and Hypergraph Models for Alzheimer's Disease."", ""A boot camp translation of Alzheimer's disease in Hispanic/Latino communities."", ""Long-term exposure to particulate matter and risk of Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia in Korea: a national population-based Cohort Study.""]"""

Methods and materials:   Administrative data were obtained from the Corporate Data Warehouse on a national cohort of 275,831 veterans (21% African American [AA]) between the ages of 40 and 70 years who were free of heart disease, did not have an elevated prostate specific antigen (PSA) level (>4 ng/ml), did not have other clinical signs of prostate cancer, had not been diagnosed with prostate cancer, and had not received treatment for prostate cancer between January 10, 1998 and September 30, 2000. Subjects were followed up until September 30, 2007. Regular users were defined as those with at least 1 annual visit to the Veterans Healthcare Administration (VHA) between October 1, 1998 and September 30, 2000. We sought to determine if race was significantly associated with PSA testing, the time to elevated PSA detection, the time to prostate biopsy, and the time to diagnosis of prostate cancer. Chi-square tests, logistic regression, and Cox proportional hazard models were used to test for associations between race and prostate cancer variables.  Results:   Eighty-four percent of the veterans between the ages 40 and 70 years undergo PSA testing. AA veterans are as likely as white veterans to undergo PSA testing. Screened AA veterans are more likely to have a PSA>4 ng/ml, undergo prostate biopsy, and be diagnosed with prostate cancer than screened white veterans. The time intervals between undergoing a prostate biopsy and being diagnosed with prostate cancer were statistically significantly shorter (although unlikely of clinical significance) for AA veterans with a PSA level>4 ng/ml than that for white veterans with a PSA level>4 ng/ml. When routine care in regular VHA users was compared with that of participants in major screening trials such as Prostate, Lung, Ovarian and Colon Cancer Trial and European Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer, prostate biopsy rates were lower (30% vs. 40%-86%), prostate cancer detection rates/person biopsied were higher (49% vs. 31%-45%), and incidence of prostate cancer was 1.1% vs. 4.9% to 8.3%.  Conclusions:   Among regular users of the VHA for healthcare, no disparities toward AA veterans exist in the use of prostate cancer screening and detection tools. Any differences in prostate cancer treatment outcomes are not likely because of inequalities in the use of prostate cancer screening or detection tools.""","""[""M'Liss A Hudson"", 'Suhong Luo', 'Timothy Chrusciel', 'Yan Yan', 'Robert L Grubb rd', 'Kenneth Carson', 'Jeffrey F Scherrer']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Prostate Cancer Outcomes in the Veterans Affairs Health Care System.', 'Racial differences in serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) doubling time, histopathological variables and long-term PSA recurrence between African-American and white American men undergoing radical prostatectomy for clinically localized prostate cancer.', 'Earlier prostate-specific antigen testing in African American men--Clinical support for the recommendation.', 'Prostate-specific antigen concentration in young men: new estimates and review of the literature.', 'Mortality Disparities in Racial/Ethnic Minority Groups in the Veterans Health Administration: An Evidence Review and Map.', 'Racial and Ethnic Variation in PSA Testing and Prostate Cancer Incidence Following the 2012 USPSTF Recommendation.', 'Prostate Cancer Disparities by Race and Ethnicity: From Nucleotide to Neighborhood.', 'Racial disparities in cancer care in the Veterans Affairs health care system and the role of site of care.', 'Impact of race in a predominantly African-American population of patients with low/intermediate risk prostate cancer undergoing radical prostatectomy within an equal access care institution.', 'Recent publications by ochsner authors.']"""

Large-scale comparative evaluation of PCa mortality (PCM) and overall mortality (OM) restricted to men without comorbidity at the time of treatment has not been performed.  Objective:   To evaluate PCM and OM in men with no recorded comorbidity treated with radical prostatectomy (RP), external-beam radiation therapy (EBRT), or brachytherapy (BT).  Design, setting, and participants:   Data from 10 361 men with localized PCa treated from 1995 to 2007 at two academic centers in the United States were prospectively obtained at diagnosis and retrospectively reviewed. We identified 6692 men with no recorded comorbidity on a validated comorbidity index. Median follow-up after treatment was 7.2 yr.  Intervention:   Treatment with RP in 4459 men, EBRT in 1261 men, or BT in 972 men.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis, including propensity score adjustment, compared PCM and OM for EBRT and BT relative to RP as reference treatment category. PCM was also evaluated by competing risks analysis.  Results and limitations:   Using Cox analysis, EBRT was associated with an increase in PCM compared with RP (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.66; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.05-2.63), while there was no statistically significant increase with BT (HR: 1.83; 95% CI, 0.88-3.82). Using competing risks analysis, the benefit of RP remained but was no longer statistically significant for EBRT (HR: 1.55; 95% CI, 0.92-2.60) or BT (HR: 1.66; 95% CI, 0.79-3.46). In comparison with RP, both EBRT (HR: 1.71; 95% CI, 1.40-2.08) and BT (HR: 1.78; 95% CI, 1.37-2.31) were associated with increased OM.  Conclusions:   In a large multicenter series of men without recorded comorbidity, both forms of radiation therapy were associated with an increase in OM compared with surgery, but there were no differences in PCM when evaluated by competing risks analysis.

Objective:   To evaluate cancer-specific (CSM) and other-cause mortality (OCM) in prostate cancer patients with BCR after RP and aRT.  Design, setting, and participants:   We identified 336 patients with BCR treated between 1990 and 2006 at two tertiary care centers.  Intervention:   All patients underwent RP plus aRT.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Cox regression analyses were used to evaluate the association between clinicopathologic variables and CSM.

Competing-risks survival analyses were used to estimate CSM and OCM for each group.  Results and limitations:   Ten-year CSM and OCM were 21.5 and 21.7%, respectively. On multivariable analyses, short time to BCR, pathologic Gleason score ≥ 8, and positive lymph node count of more than two at RP were significantly associated with increased CSM rate (all p ≤ 0.01). These variables were used to develop a novel nomogram, which was used to stratify patients according to their 10-yr, nomogram-calculated, CSM probability: ≤ 10% versus >10-30% versus >30%. On competing-risks analysis, 10-yr CSM rate for these groups was 6%, 15%, and 42%, respectively, for patients aged ≤ 68 yr, versus 8%, 19%, and 42% for patients aged >68 yr.

The base excision repair (BER) pathway including the apurinic/apyrimidic endonuclease (APE1, also known as APEX1) gene plays an important role in preventing the accumulation of DNA damage and maintaining genomic stability. The aim of the present study is to determine whether polymorphisms of APE1 are associated with the risk of prostate cancer (PCa) in the Chinese Han population.  Methods:   This study consisted of 198 patients with PCa and 156 healthy controls. The polymorphisms of APE1, Asp148Glu (rs1130409) and -141T/G (rs1760944) were determined by the polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method.  Results:   The genotypic distributions of the two polymorphisms in controls were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (p = 0.92 and p = 0.83, respectively). Logistic regression analysis indicated that the -141GG genotype was significantly associated with a decreased risk of PCa compared with the -141TT genotype (p = 0.03; OR 0.49; 95% CI 0.26 - 0.92). The G allele was also significantly associated with a reduced risk of PCa compared with the T allele (p = 0.02; OR 0.71; 95% CI 0.52 - 0.96).

Post-implant dosimetry (PID) is an important tool for identifying suboptimal implants. The aim of this work was to improve suboptimal implants by a subsequent iodine-125 seed top-up (reimplantation), based on the PID results.  Methods:   Of 255 patients treated between 2009 and 2012, 6 were identified as having received suboptimal implants and were scheduled for seed top-up. Needle configurations and the number of top-up seeds were determined based on post-implant CT images as well as a reimplantation treatment plan. An average of 14 seeds per patient were implanted during each top-up. Dosimetric outcome was assessed via target parameters and doses received by organs at risk.  Results:   All six patients had a successful top-up, with a 67% increase in the mean dose delivered to 90% of the prostate volume and a 40% increase in the volume that receives 100% of the prescribed dose. However, the final dosimetric assessment was based on the same seed activity, as the planning system does not account for the decay of the initially implanted seeds. Although physical dosimetry is not influenced by different seed activities (doses are calculated to infinity), the radiobiological implications might be slightly different from the situation when optimal implantation is achieved with one treatment only.  Conclusion:   Seed reimplantation in suboptimal prostate implants is feasible and leads to successful clinical outcomes.  Advances in knowledge:   Suboptimal prostate implants can occur for various reasons.

However, few studies have had high-quality assessment of both dietary and supplemental consumption of micronutrients, rendering possible different source-specific effects difficult to discern. This study evaluates associations between intake of vitamin C, E, folate, and beta-carotene and prostate cancer risk, focusing on possible different effects of dietary, supplemental, or total intake and on potential effect modification by alcohol intake and BMI.  Methods:   Danish prospective cohort study of 26,856 men aged 50-64 years with questionnaire-based information on diet, supplements, and lifestyle. Hazard ratios (HRs) for prostate cancer associated with micronutrient intake were calculated using Cox proportional hazard analyses.  Results:   During follow-up (1993-2010), 1,571 prostate cancer cases were identified. Supplemental folic acid was inversely associated with prostate cancer risk, notably on a continuous scale [HR 0.88 (95 % CI 0.79-0.98) per 100 μg increase/day]. The risk reduction was largely confined to non-aggressive tumors [HR 0.71 (0.55-0.93) per 100 μg increase/day]. No influence on prostate cancer risk was observed for dietary folate or for the other studied micronutrients, regardless of source.

This study examined dietary changes in men before and after treatment for PC within the prostate testing for cancer and treatment randomized trial.  Methods:   This was a prospective cohort study in community-based men aged 50-69 tested for PC in nine UK areas. 3,935 men completed food frequency questionnaires before diagnosis and 678 with localized PC repeated the questionnaire 1 year later (response 82.7 %).  Results:   Men subsequently diagnosed with or without PC all consumed similar diets before diagnosis. Diagnosis of PC led to dietary changes, with 234 (34.7 %) men eating more fresh tomatoes (p < 0.0001) and 156 (23.5 %) more tomato products (p = 0.01). 271 (40.0 %) men consumed more protein (p < 0.0001) and 193 (28.6 %) more fruit/vegetable juice (p < 0.0001). Fewer macronutrients were obtained from dairy products (p < 0.01). Men undergoing active monitoring increased their fruit/vegetable juice intake after diagnosis (p = 0.0023) more than men who had surgery or radiotherapy.  Conclusions:   Around one-third of men spontaneously adopted a healthier diet and also consumed more 'prostate-healthy' foods following a diagnosis of PC. Dietary choices also differed by radical or monitoring treatments, indicating that men undergoing active surveillance may be more likely to pursue dietary changes as an adjunct therapy. PC survivors can adopt healthier diets, thus providing clinicians with opportunities to support PC survivorship by providing targeted advice beneficial to general and potentially prostate-specific health.""","""['Kerry N L Avery', 'Jenny L Donovan', 'Rebecca Gilbert', 'Michael Davis', 'Pauline Emmett', 'Liz Down', 'Steven Oliver', 'David E Neal', 'Freddie C Hamdy', 'J Athene Lane']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Cancer Causes Control""","""['The importance of dietary change for men diagnosed with and at risk of prostate cancer: a multi-centre interview study with men, their partners and health professionals.', ""Men's knowledge and attitudes towards dietary prevention of a prostate cancer diagnosis: a qualitative study."", 'Current health behaviors and readiness to pursue life-style changes among men and women diagnosed with early stage prostate and breast carcinomas.', 'Health-related quality of life among long-term (≥5\xa0years) prostate cancer survivors by primary intervention: a systematic review.', 'Nutrition, physical activity, and lifestyle factors in prostate cancer prevention.', 'The effect of a phytoestrogen intervention and impact of genetic factors on tumor proliferation markers among Swedish patients with prostate cancer: study protocol for the randomized controlled PRODICA trial.', 'Adherence to Mediterranean Diet, Physical Activity and Survival after Prostate Cancer Diagnosis.', 'Feasibility of a Weight Management Program Tailored for Overweight Men with Localized Prostate Cancer - A Pilot Study.', 'Strategies adopted by men to deal with uncertainty and anxiety when following an active surveillance/monitoring protocol for localised prostate cancer and implications for care: a longitudinal qualitative study embedded within the ProtecT trial.', 'Phase II randomised control feasibility trial of a nutrition and physical activity intervention after radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer.']"""

Several compounds found to restore sensitivity of cancer cells to TRAIL, a TNF family death ligand with promising therapeutic potential, act by targeting c-FLIP ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome. The generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) has been implicated in c-FLIP protein degradation. However, the mechanism by which ROS post-transcriptionally regulate c-FLIP protein levels is not well understood. We show here that treatment of prostate cancer PPC-1 cells with the superoxide generators menadione, paraquat, or buthionine sulfoximine down-regulates c-FLIP long (c-FLIP(L)) protein levels, which is prevented by the proteasome inhibitor MG132. Furthermore, pretreatment of PPC-1 cells with a ROS scavenger prevented ubiquitination and loss of c-FLIP(L) protein induced by menadione or paraquat. We identified lysine 167 as a novel ubiquitination site of c-FLIP(L) important for ROS-dependent degradation. We also identified threonine 166 as a novel phosphorylation site and demonstrate that Thr-166 phosphorylation is required for ROS-induced Lys-167 ubiquitination. The mutation of either Thr-166 or Lys-167 was sufficient to stabilize c-FLIP protein levels in PPC-1, HEK293T, and HeLa cancer cells treated with menadione or paraquat. Accordingly, expression of c-FLIP T166A or K167R mutants protected cells from ROS-mediated sensitization to TRAIL-induced cell death. Our findings reveal novel ROS-dependent post-translational modifications of the c-FLIP protein that regulate its stability, thus impacting sensitivity of cancer cells to TRAIL.""","""['Rachel P Wilkie-Grantham', 'Shu-Ichi Matsuzawa', 'John C Reed']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Biol Chem""","""['6-Shogaol enhances renal carcinoma Caki cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis through reactive oxygen species-mediated cytochrome c release and down-regulation of c-FLIP(L) expression.', 'Compound C sensitizes Caki renal cancer cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis through reactive oxygen species-mediated down-regulation of c-FLIPL and Mcl-1.', 'Hyperthermia restores apoptosis induced by death receptors through aggregation-induced c-FLIP cytosolic depletion.', 'Down-regulation of intracellular anti-apoptotic proteins, particularly c-FLIP by therapeutic agents; the novel view to overcome resistance to TRAIL.', 'Targeting c-FLIP in cancer.', 'Pyrazolo4,3-etetrazolo1,5-b1,2,4triazine Sulfonamides as Novel Potential Anticancer Agents: Apoptosis, Oxidative Stress, and Cell Cycle Analysis.', 'Modulation of redox homeostasis: A strategy to overcome cancer drug resistance.', 'FAIM Enhances the Efficacy of Mesenchymal Stem Cell Transplantation by Inhibiting JNK-Induced c-FLIP Ubiquitination and Degradation.', 'Restoring TRAILR2/DR5-Mediated Activation of Apoptosis upon Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress as a Therapeutic Strategy in Cancer.', 'FAIMS Enhances the Detection of PTM Crosstalk Sites.']"""

While the precursor complex was found to be inactive and L4 exhibited moderate activity only in the MCF7 cell line, the coordination of L4 to the {Ru(p-cym)} moiety remarkably enhanced the activity of the whole complex. In fact, complex 4 [Ru2(p-cym)2(L4)2]Cl2 was found to be the most active agent of the whole series, and was studied further (as well as complex 1 for comparison). Concerning the mode of action, the mechanism of cell death for both 1 and 4 seemed to be related to apoptotic processes, and they strongly interacted with tubulin (involved in the cell cycle) and with integrin (involved in the cytoskeleton formation). As an approach to their pharmacokinetics, the interaction of 1 and 4 with human serum albumin (HSA) was assessed. A quantitative model for the binding of 4 to HSA is proposed from Circular Dichroism data, and validated by fluorescence results. Models of Förster resonance energy transfer and fluorescence quenching afforded the distance of 4 to the lone Trp214 residue.

Methods:   Cancer data were abstracted from the annual statistical reports of the P.A. Hertzen Research Institute of Oncology in Moscow. The annual number and percent of cases, crude and age-standardized cancer incidence (ASIR) and mortality (ASMR) rates per 100,000 among men and women in the Chukotka Autonomous Okrug were determined for the period 1997-2010 for incidence and 1999-2010 for mortality. Two years' data were aggregated to generate temporal trends during the period. In age-standardization, the Segi-Doll world standard population used by the International Agency for Research on Cancer was used.  Results:   The higher incidence and mortality rate of cancer (all sites combined) among men compared to women, which was observed in Russia nationally, was reflected also in Chukotka, although the difference between men and women was not statistically significant. Overall, the patterns of cancer sites are similar between Chukotka and Russia, with cancer of the lung/trachea/bronchus and stomach occupying the top ranks among men. Oesophageal cancer is common in Chukotka but not in Russia, whereas prostate cancer is common in Russia but not in Chukotka. Among women, breast cancer is either the commonest or second commonest cancer in terms of incidence or mortality in both Chukotka and Russia. Cancer of the lung/trachea/bronchi ranks higher in Chukotka than in Russia. The rate of cancer incidence and mortality for all sites combined during the 13-year period was relatively stable in Russia. Dividing the period into two halves, an increase among both men and women was observed in Chukotka for all sites combined, and also for colorectal cancer.  Conclusions:   This paper presents previously unavailable cancer epidemiological data on Chukotka. They provide a basis for comparative studies across circumpolar regions and countries. With its small population, cancer rates in Chukotka tend to be highly unstable and fluctuate widely from year to year. Even when aggregated over a decade or more, only broad conclusions regarding patterns and trends can be made regarding some of the commonest cancer sites, or with all sites combined. Chukotka experienced substantial social and economic dislocations during the period under study, which could conceivably affect risk factor distribution and the quality of medical care.""","""['Alexey A Dudarev', 'Valery S Chupakhin', 'Jon Øyvind Odland']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Int J Circumpolar Health""","""['Cancer mortality in the indigenous population of coastal Chukotka, 1961-1990.', 'Cancer incidence in the Nenetskij Avtonomnyj Okrug, Arctic Russia.', 'Health and society in Chukotka: an overview.', 'Annual report to the nation on the status of cancer, 1975-2000, featuring the uses of surveillance data for cancer prevention and control.', 'Cancer and demographic transition.', 'North Pacific Baleen Whales as a Potential Source of Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) in the Diet of the Indigenous Peoples of the Eastern Arctic Coasts.', 'Renal cell carcinoma in the Canadian Indigenous population.', 'Cancer Incidence and Mortality in Greenland 1983-2014 - Including Comparison With the Other Nordic Countries.', 'Trends in Breast Cancer Epidemiology in Chelyabinsk Region, 2006-2015.', 'Clinical, Histopathological and Molecular Characteristics of Metastatic Breast Cancer in North-Eastern Kazakhstan: a 10 Year Retrospective Study.']"""

Here we report the discovery of a novel tryptophyllin (TPH) peptide, named PsT-1, from this frog species. Skin secretions from specimens of P. sauvagei were collected by mild electrical stimulation. Peptides were identified and characterized by transcriptome cloning, and the structure was confirmed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and automated Edman degradation. This novel peptide was encoded by a single precursor of 61 amino acid residues, whose primary structure was deduced from cloned skin cDNA. Analysis of different amphibian tryptophyllins revealed that PsT-1 exhibited a high degree of primary structural similarity to its homologs, PdT-1 and PdT-2, from the Mexican giant leaf frog, Pachymedusa dacnicolor. A synthetic replicate of PsT-1 was found to inhibit bradykinin-induced vasorelaxation of phenylephrine pre-constricted rat tail artery smooth muscle. It was also found that PsT-1 had an anti-proliferative effect on three different human prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP/PC3/DU145), by use of an MTT assay coupled with direct cell counting as measures of cell growth. These data indicate that PsT-1 is a likely bradykinin receptor antagonist and its biological effects are probably mediated through bradykinin receptors. As a BK antagonist, PST-1, with antagonistic effects on BK in artery smooth muscle, inhibition of proliferation in prostate cancer cells and lack of undesirable side effects, may have potential in cardiovascular, inflammatory and anticancer therapy.""","""['Ran Wang', 'Tianbao Chen', 'Mei Zhou', 'Lei Wang', 'Chris Shaw']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Regul Pept""","""['PdT-2: a novel myotropic type-2 tryptophyllin from the skin secretion of the Mexican giant leaf frog, Pachymedusa dacnicolor.', 'Pachymedusa dacnicolor tryptophyllin-1: structural characterization, pharmacological activity and cloning of precursor cDNA.', 'PD-sauvagine: a novel sauvagine/corticotropin releasing factor analogue from the skin secretion of the Mexican giant leaf frog, Pachymedusa dacnicolor.', 'A review on bradykinin-related peptides isolated from amphibian skin secretion.', 'Biochemical problems of regulation by oligopeptides.', 'Neuroprotective effects on microglia and insights into the structure-activity relationship of an antioxidant peptide isolated from Pelophylax perezi.', 'The peptide secreted at the water to land transition in a model amphibian has antioxidant effects.', 'AaeAP1 and AaeAP2: novel antimicrobial peptides from the venom of the scorpion, Androctonus aeneas: structural characterisation, molecular cloning of biosynthetic precursor-encoding cDNAs and engineering of analogues with enhanced antimicrobial and anticancer activities.', 'AcT-2: a novel myotropic and antimicrobial type 2 tryptophyllin from the skin secretion of the Central American red-eyed leaf frog, Agalychnis callidryas.']"""

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the characteristics of TomoDirect plans compared to conventional TomoHelical plans.  Methods:   TomoDirect and TomoHelical plans were compared in 46 patients with a prostate, thoracic wall or lung tumor. The mean target dose was used as the prescription dose. The minimum coverage dose of 95% of the target (D95%), conformity index (CI), uniformity index (UI), dose distribution in organs at risk and treatment time were evaluated. For TomoDirect, 2 to 5 static ports were used depending on the tumor location.  Results:   For the prostate target volume, TomoDirect plans could not reduce the rectal dose and required a longer treatment time than TomoHelical. For the thoracic wall target volume, the V5Gy of the lung or liver was lower in TomoDirect than in TomoHelical (p = 0.02). For the lung target volume, TomoDirect yielded higher CI (p = 0.009) but smaller V5Gy of the lung (p = 0.005) than TomoHelical. Treatment time did not differ significantly between the thoracic wall and lung plans.  Conclusion:   Prostate cancers should be treated with the TomoHelical mode.

Patients who had completed a multidisciplinary rehabilitation programme with psychosocial support and physiotherapy were interviewed in two focus groups: Group 1 consisted of six men who came to the rehabilitation with their spouses, and Group 2 of seven men who came alone. Meaning condensation was used to analyse the interviews. Radiotherapy was described as full-time work. Adverse effects due to ADT influencing masculinity and identity were emphasised. The men embraced life with a particular sense of humour. Whether rehabilitation was experienced as useful depended on the health professionals' approach, and on the patients' motivation and effort to contribute to health promotion, and to convert experiences into coping strategies. The supportive role of the spouse was emphasised by several, but some men preferred to handle the process alone. In conclusion, men undergoing ADT should be carefully informed of the consequences. Spousal involvement in rehabilitation must be decided by the patient. The focus group interviews themselves had a positive impact on the men's understanding of their rehabilitation processes. The specific male approach and differences between the needs of female and male cancer patients are important to understand when planning rehabilitation.""","""['K B Dieperink', 'L Wagner', 'S Hansen', 'O Hansen']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Eur J Cancer Care (Engl)""","""[""'You know I've joined your club… I'm the hot flush boy': a qualitative exploration of hot flushes and night sweats in men undergoing androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer."", 'A longitudinal study of coping strategies in men receiving radiotherapy and neo-adjuvant androgen deprivation for prostate cancer: a quantitative and qualitative study.', 'Perceived barriers and facilitators to physical activity in men with prostate cancer: possible influence of androgen deprivation therapy.', 'The unique needs of couples experiencing androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Increased risk of metabolic syndrome, diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular disease in men receiving androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer.', ""Men's perceptions and preferences regarding prostate cancer radiation therapy: A systematic scoping review."", 'Social Support Mediates the Relationship between Body Image Distress and Depressive Symptoms in Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'Body image, self-esteem, and sense of masculinity in patients with prostate cancer: a qualitative meta-synthesis.', 'Coping strategies in active and inactive men with prostate cancer: a qualitative study.', 'Developing a digital intervention for cancer survivors: an evidence-, theory- and person-based approach.']"""

Changes in gene expression of cancer patients were compared with the control group of healthy donors. We have established that all patients had a decreased level of the Kras gene expression even before radiotherapy; moreover, the group of patients with prostate cancer had a low content of mRNA in NPM1 and p14(ARF), and the group of patients with head and neck cancerhad a reliably reduced mRNA in P53, NPM1 and p14(ARF). The radiation therapy did not cause essential changes in the expression of these genes of cancer patients, ecpect for the Kras gene, whose the mRNA level in the group of patients with head and neck cancer was reliably lower than the mRNA level prior to beginning of radiation therapy. The correlations of P53, NPM1, Kras, p14(ARF) gene expression were studied. We have shown that p14(ARF) mRNA level negatively correlates with Kras mRNA (R = -0.6, p = 0.002) and P53 mRNA levels (R = -0.49, p = 0.013) in the control group of healthy donors. A positive correlation was observed between P53 mRNA and NPM1 mRNA (R = 0.54, p = 0.006). Similar correlations between mRNA levels of these genes in blood cells were absent in the cancer patients before radiotherapy. After radiotherapy in patients with prostate cancer, p14(ARF) mRNA level positively correlated with NPM1 mRNA (R = 0.7, p = 0.001) and negatively with Kras mRNA (R = - 0.5, p = 0.03). Our results provide evidence that expression P53, NPM1, Kras and p14(ARF) genes may be coordinated in blood cells of healthy donors.

A study group comprised 12 patients who had developed a biochemical recurrence with no evidence of systemic progression of the disease in different periods after RPE. All the patients underwent multiphase MRI using T1-T2-weighted, diffusion-weighted, and postcontrast images. The MRI pattern of a cystourethral anastomotic area was analyzed from T2-weighted (T2-WI), diffusion-weighted (DWI), and postcontrast images (PCI) in all the patients. The local recurrence of PC was verified in them, using puncture biopsy under transrectal ultrasound guidance, by keeping in mind the MRI pattern. The use of DWI and postcontrast sequences was shown to substantially enhance the sensitivity of MRI in the diagnosis of local recurrences of PC as compared to an isolated analysis of T2WI (0.83, 0.67, and 0.42, respectively). Thus, in patients with a suspected local recurrence of PC after RPE, the visual estimate of DWI and PCI during small pelvic MRI makes it possible to considerably improve the recognition of a tumor nodule and to increase the efficiency of morphological verification of a recurrence of the disease.""","""['V V Kapustin', 'A I Gromov', 'D S Koshurnikov']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Vestn Rentgenol Radiol""","""['Comparative sensitivities of functional MRI sequences in detection of local recurrence of prostate carcinoma after radical prostatectomy or external-beam radiotherapy.', 'MR imaging evaluation with a transrectal surface coil of local recurrence of prostatic cancer in men who have undergone radical prostatectomy.', 'Incremental value of T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted MRI for prediction of biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy in clinically localized prostate cancer.', 'Role of magnetic resonance imaging in the detection of local prostate cancer recurrence after external beam radiotherapy and radical prostatectomy.', 'Role of MRI in follow-up after focal therapy for prostate carcinoma.']"""

Objectives:   To evaluate the efficacy and safety of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBO) for HRC.  Methods:   Daily 90 minute sessions of HBO at 2 ATM 100% oxygen were given to 32 HRC patients with ASTRO grades 3-4 hematuria.  Results:   The median age was 72.5 (48-88 years). The median time interval between radiation therapy and HBO was 4 years (1-26 years). The patients received a median of 30 HBO sessions (3-53). Hematuria resolved in 27 patients (84%) and persisted in 5. Cystectomy was required in two, and ileal-conduit and bilateral percutaneous nephrostomies were performed in one and two patients, respectively. With a median follow-up of 12 months (5-74 months), the hematuria cleared completely in 16 patients (59%) and mild hematuria requiring no further treatment recurred in 10 others. Another patient with ASTRO grade 4 hematuria needed bladder irrigation and blood transfusions. Complications included eardrum perforation in four patients and transient vertigo and mild hemoptysis in one case each. None of them required HBO discontinuation.

The inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis by CDDO-Me in LNCaP and PC-3 prostate cancer cell lines was associated with the inhibition of hTERT gene expression, hTERT telomerase activity and a number of proteins that regulate hTERT transcriptionally and post-translationally. Furthermore, ablation of hTERT protein increased the sensitivity of cancer cells to CDDO-Me, whereas its overexpression rendered them resistant to CDDO-Me. In addition, inhibition of progression of preneoplastic lesions (i.e., low and high-grade prostate intraepithelial neoplasms, PINs) to adenocarcinoma of the prostate by CDDO-Me in TRAMP mice was associated with significant decrease in TERT and its regulatory proteins in the prostate gland.

However, the potential of CTCs to actually form new tumors has not been tested. Popular methods of isolating CTCs are biased towards larger, more differentiated, non-viable cells, creating a barrier to testing their tumor forming potential. Without relying on cell size or the expression of differentiation markers, our objective was to isolate viable prostate CTCs from mice and humans and assay their ability to initiate new tumors. Therefore, blood was collected from transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate (TRAMP) mice and from human patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (PCa). Gradient density centrifugation or red cell lysis was used to remove erythrocytes, and then leukocytes were depleted by magnetic separation using CD45 immunoaffinity beads. CTCs fractions from TRAMP mice and PCa patients were verified by immunocytochemical staining for cytokeratin 8 and EpCAM, and inoculated into immunodeficient mice. TRAMP tumor growth was monitored by palpation. Human tumor growth formation was monitored up to 8 months by ultrasensitive PSA assays performed on mouse serum. We found viable tumor cells present in the bloodstream that were successfully isolated from mice without relying on cell surface markers. Two out of nine immunodeficient mice inoculated with TRAMP CTCs developed massive liver metastases. CTCs were identified in blood from PCa patients but did not form tumors. In conclusion, viable CTCs can be isolated without relying on epithelial surface markers or size fractionation. TRAMP CTCs were tumorigenic, so CTCs isolated in this way contain viable tumor-initiating cells. Only two of nine hosts grew TRAMP tumors and none of the human CTCs formed tumors, which suggests that most CTCs have relatively low tumor-forming potential. Future studies should identify and target the highly tumorigenic cells.""","""['Filipe L F Carvalho', 'Brian W Simons', 'Emmanuel S Antonarakis', 'Zeshaan Rasheed', 'Nora Douglas', 'Daniela Villegas', 'William Matsui', 'David M Berman']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['Heterogeneous atypical cell populations are present in blood of metastatic breast cancer patients.', 'Circulating tumour cells escape from EpCAM-based detection due to epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition.', 'EpCAM-Independent Enrichment of Circulating Tumor Cells in Metastatic Breast Cancer.', 'Circulating tumour cells: the evolving concept and the inadequacy of their enrichment by EpCAM-based methodology for basic and clinical cancer research.', 'Current and future role of circulating tumor cells in patients with epithelial ovarian cancer.', 'Toll-like receptors: exploring their potential connection with post-operative infectious complications and cancer recurrence.', 'CTCs 2020: Great Expectations or Unreasonable Dreams.', 'Heterogeneity in Circulating Tumor Cells: The Relevance of the Stem-Cell Subset.', 'Limiting tumor seeding as a therapeutic approach for metastatic disease.', 'Minimal residual disease in prostate cancer patients after primary treatment: theoretical considerations, evidence and possible use in clinical management.']"""

Previous studies quantifying prostate cancer risk in LS have provided conflicting results.  Methods:   We examined cancer histories of probands and their first- through fourth-degree relatives for 198 independent mutation-positive LS families enrolled in two US familial cancer registries. Modified segregation analysis was used to calculate age-specific cumulative risk or penetrance estimates, with accompanying Wald-type CIs. Cumulative lifetime risks and hazard ratio (HR) estimates for prostate cancer were calculated and compared with those of the general population.  Results:   Ninety-seven cases of prostate cancer were observed in 4,127 men. Median age at prostate cancer diagnosis was 65 years (range, 38 to 89 years), with 11.53% of affected individuals diagnosed before age 50 years. The cumulative risk of prostate cancer at ages 60 and 80 years was 6.30% (95% CI, 2.47 to 9.96) and 30.0% (95% CI, 16.54 to 41.30), as compared with the population risk of 2.59% and 17.84%, respectively. The overall prostate cancer HR among carriers was 1.99 (95% CI, 1.31 to 3.03).  Conclusion:   The cumulative lifetime risk of prostate cancer in individuals with LS is two-fold higher than in the general population and is slightly higher in carriers diagnosed before age 60 years (HR, 2.48; 95% CI, 1.34 to 4.59).

Sixty-five percent of the office-based (16/24 urologists; 6/10 oncologists) and 95 % of the hospital-based (10/11 urologists; 8/8 oncologists) physicians participate in multidisciplinary tumour boards (MTBs). However, only 1.5 % of patients with a new diagnosis of prostate cancer (13 of 883) are discussed at a MTB. Overall, second opinions at diagnosis are requested in 23 % of patients, mainly from radiation oncologists (8.4 %) or fellow urologists (7.4 %). Second opinions are more often requested by urologists who participate at MTBs and in case of advanced stage.  Conclusions:   Participation at MTBs is high among Swiss urologists and oncologists in private practice and at non-university tertiary centers. In spite of that only a small minority of patietns with prostate cancer are presented at MTBs.""","""['Räto T Strebel', 'Tullio Sulser', 'Hans-Peter Schmid', 'Silke Gillessen', 'Martin Fehr', 'Urs Huber', 'Miklos Pless', 'Rudolf Morant', 'Ralph Winterhalder', 'Richard Cathomas']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Support Care Cancer""","""['Differences in practice patterns between urologists and radiation oncologists in the management of localized prostate cancer: a cross-sectional survey.', ""United States radiation oncologists' and urologists' opinions about screening and treatment of prostate cancer vary by region."", 'Comparison of recommendations by urologists and radiation oncologists for treatment of clinically localized prostate cancer.', 'The role of androgen ablation in patients with biochemical or local failure after definitive radiation therapy: a survey of practice patterns of urologists and radiation oncologists in the United States.', 'Optimizing treatment for men with advanced prostate cancer: expert recommendations and the multidisciplinary approach.', 'Problems and Promises of Introducing the Magnetic Resonance Imaging Linear Accelerator Into Routine Care: The Case of Prostate Cancer.', ""'Act on oncology' as a new comprehensive approach to assess prostate cancer centres--method description and results of a pilot study."", 'Information needs of early-stage prostate cancer patients: within- and between-group agreement of patients and health professionals.', 'Innovation: Tumour board--introducing real time to oncology management.']"""

We examined the relationship between these two conditions.  Materials and methods:   We performed a case-control study at a Veterans Affairs Hospital among 708 men: 312 healthy controls, 167 men with CaP, and 229 men without CaP on prostate biopsy. Participants were asked to self-describe hair patterns at ages 30 and 40 and at study enrollment. We tested the association between hair pattern (overall, vertex, or frontal) and CaP status using logistic regression analysis adjusting for multiple clinical features. Disease grade was similarly examined as a secondary outcome.  Results:   Relative to healthy controls, younger age of AA onset was significantly associated with increased CaP risk (p = 0.008). Similar patterns were noted for frontal (p = 0.005) and not vertex balding (p = 0.22). When compared with biopsy-negative men, a similar pattern was seen with younger age of AA onset having higher risk of CaP, though this was not significant (p = 0.07). A suggestion for younger age of AA onset for frontal (p = 0.07) being associated with CaP versus biopsy-negative men was also observed. Overall balding (yes/no) was associated with greater than twofold increase in high-grade disease (p = 0.02).  Conclusions:   Men reporting earlier AA onset were at increased CaP risk and suggestively had more aggressive disease. Contrary to other studies, frontal balding was the predominant pattern associated with elevated CaP risk. Further study is required to confirm these findings in a larger sample and to better understand the role of AA, androgens, and CaP biology.""","""['Jean-Alfred Thomas', 'Jodi A Antonelli', 'Lionel L Banez', 'Catherine Hoyo', 'Delores Grant', 'Wendy Demark-Wahnefried', 'Elizabeth A Platz', 'Leah Gerber', 'Kathryn Shuler', 'Enwono Eyoh', 'Elizabeth Calloway', 'Stephen J Freedland']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Cancer Causes Control""","""['Androgenetic alopecia and prostate cancer: findings from an Australian case-control study.', 'Early-onset baldness and the risk of aggressive prostate cancer: findings from a case-control study.', 'Age-dependent associations between androgenetic alopecia and prostate cancer risk.', 'Androgenetic alopecia and risk of prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Androgen modulation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in androgenetic alopecia.', 'Baldness and Risk of Prostate Cancer in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study.', 'Male pattern baldness and incidence of prostate cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Possible association between androgenic alopecia and risk of prostate cancer and testicular germ cell tumor: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Male Pattern Baldness in Relation to Prostate Cancer-Specific Mortality: A Prospective Analysis in the NHANES I Epidemiologic Follow-up Study.', 'Male pattern baldness in relation to prostate cancer risks: an analysis in the VITamins and lifestyle (VITAL) cohort study.']"""

Although these tumors are not as hormonally responsive as acinar adenocarcinomas, some of them respond to androgen withdrawal. Before making a diagnosis of primary mucinous adenocarcinoma, is necessary to exclude an extraprostatic malignant neoplasia, especially from the bladder or bowel.

Methods:   URF are a recognized but rare complication of treatments for prostate and rectal cancers. URF can lead to incontinence, fecaluria, pain, urinary infection, and sepsis, and thus are usually treated surgically. We present a series of 3 patients whose complex URF were managed conservatively. Between 2004 and 2010, 43 patients were diagnosed with URF resulting from treatment for prostate or rectal cancer. All patients were evaluated and offered surgical treatment; 40 patients elected surgical therapy, and 3 patients chose conservative, nonoperative management of the URF. The primary outcome was the patient choosing or needing formal surgical URF closure. Because this was not a comparative study, no formal statistical analysis was undertaken.  Results:   The 3 patients have been regularly monitored and have required symptomatic and episodic care. None, however, has opted for formal surgical fistula repair, and to date, all continue in conservative management of their URF.  Conclusion:   Spontaneous URF closure is uncommon and is unknown to occur in complex URF. Surgery is the mainstay of treatment. Patients should consider treatment options, potential outcomes, and their quality of life when choosing or not choosing treatment.

One of their main drawbacks is the lack of spatial accuracy, since they consider the organs as a whole volume and thus ignore the heterogeneous intra-organ radio-sensitivity. In this paper, we propose a dose-image-based framework to reveal the relationships between local dose and toxicity. In this approach, the three-dimensional (3D) planned dose distributions across a population are non-rigidly registered into a common coordinate system and compared at a voxel level, therefore enabling the identification of 3D anatomical patterns, which may be responsible for toxicity, at least to some extent. Additionally, different metrics were employed in order to assess the quality of the dose mapping. The value of this approach was demonstrated by prospectively analyzing rectal bleeding (≥Grade 1 at 2 years) according to the CTCAE v3.0 classification in a series of 105 patients receiving 80 Gy to the prostate by intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). Within the patients presenting bleeding, a significant dose excess (6 Gy on average, p < 0.01) was found in a region of the anterior rectal wall. This region, close to the prostate (1 cm), represented less than 10% of the rectum. This promising voxel-wise approach allowed subregions to be defined within the organ that may be involved in toxicity and, as such, must be considered during the inverse IMRT planning step.""","""['Oscar Acosta', 'Gael Drean', 'Juan D Ospina', 'Antoine Simon', 'Pascal Haigron', 'Caroline Lafond', 'Renaud de Crevoisier']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Distinct effects of rectum delineation methods in 3D-conformal vs. IMRT treatment planning of prostate cancer.', 'Rectal and Urethro-Vesical Subregions for Toxicity Prediction After Prostate Cancer Radiation Therapy: Validation of Voxel-Based Models in an Independent Population.', 'Pilot study of conformal intensity modulated radiation therapy for localized prostate cancer.', 'Dose-volume analysis of predictors for chronic rectal toxicity after treatment of prostate cancer with adaptive image-guided radiotherapy.', 'Rectal radiation dose-reduction techniques in prostate cancer: a focus on the rectal spacer.', 'Feature Importance Analysis of a Deep Learning Model for Predicting Late Bladder Toxicity Occurrence in Uterine Cervical Cancer Patients.', 'Image-based data mining applies to data collected from children.', 'Atlas construction and spatial normalisation to facilitate radiation-induced late effects research in childhood cancer.', 'Toxicity in patients treated with permanent prostate brachytherapy using intraoperatively built custom-linked seeds versus loose seeds.', 'Planning With Patient-Specific Rectal Sub-Region Constraints Decreases Probability of Toxicity in Prostate Cancer Radiotherapy.']"""

Methods:   A multi-centre prospective colorectal cancer registry was queried for patients with a prior history of prostate, breast or lung cancer. Characteristics of these patients were compared to patients with colorectal cancer and no prior cancer history.  Results:   Of 4660 cases of colorectal cancer diagnosed between 1998 and 2011, 2665 (57.2%) were male, median age was 68 years. For patients with a history of prostate cancer (n = 111), breast cancer (n = 61) and lung cancer (n = 23), the great majority of subsequent colorectal cancer diagnoses occurred in the initial 2 to 4 years after the first cancer diagnosis. This was accompanied by an increased rate of asymptomatic colorectal cancer at presentation, due to both screen detected and incidental cancer diagnoses. There was no clear relationship between any prostate cancer treatment and subsequent colorectal cancer risk, location or timing.  Discussion:   In the modern era, there is an increased rate of colorectal cancer diagnosis in years shortly following another common cancer history. This is consistently seen across different primary tumour streams including prostate, breast and lung cancers and in part contributed by screen detected and incidental colorectal cancer diagnoses.

It is a racemate drug, and its activity resides in the (R)-enantiomer, with little in the (S)-enantiomer. A major metabolic pathway for bicalutamide is glucuronidation catalysed by UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzymes. While (S)bicalutamide is directly glucuronidated, (R)bicalutamide requires hydroxylation prior to glucuronidation. The contribution of human tissues and UGT isoforms in the metabolism of these enantiomers has not been extensively investigated. In this study, both (R) and/or (S)bicalutamide were converted into glucuronide (-G) derivatives after incubation of pure and racemic solutions with microsomal extracts from human liver and kidney. Intestinal microsomes exhibited only low reactivity with these substrates. Km values of liver and kidney samples for (S)bicalutamide glucuronidation were similar, and lower than values obtained with the (R)-enantiomer. Among the 16 human UGTs tested, UGT1A8 and UGT1A9 were able to form both (S) and (R)bicalutamide-G from pure or racemic substrates. UGT2B7 was also able to form (R)bicalutamide-G.

DOX-DM complexation was confirmed by florescence polarization measurement, proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and molecular modeling. Enhanced penetration of DOX-DM (at 1:10 molar ratio), compared to the free DOX, into prostate 3D multicellular tumor spheroids (MTS) was confirmed by confocal laser scanning microscopy. Furthermore, DOX-DM complexes achieved a significantly higher cytotoxicity in DU145 MTS system compared to the free drug, as shown by growth delay curves. Incubation of MTS with low DOX concentration (1 μM) complexed with DM led to a significant delay in MTS growth compared to untreated MTS or MTS treated with free DOX. DOX-DM complex retention was also achieved in a Calu-6 lung cancer xenograft model in tumor-bearing mice, as shown by live whole animal fluorescence imaging. Therapeutic experiments in B16F10 tumor bearing mice have shown enhanced therapeutic efficacy of DOX when complexed to DM. This study suggests that the cationic poly-l-lysine DM molecules studied here could, in addition to their systemic antiangiogenic property, complex chemotherapeutic drugs such as DOX and improve their accumulation and cytotoxicity into MTS and solid tumors in vivo.

Methods:   Men with a first-degree family history of prostate cancer (FDRs; n = 207) and men without a family history (PM; n = 239) completed a Computer Assisted Telephone Interview (CATI) examining prostate cancer risk perceptions, PSA testing behaviors, perceptions of similarity to the typical man who gets prostate cancer (representativeness heuristic), and availability of information about prostate cancer (availability heuristic). A path model explored family history as influencing the availability of information about prostate cancer (number of acquaintances with prostate cancer and number of recent discussions about prostate cancer) to mediate judgments of risk and to predict PSA testing behaviors and family history as a moderator of the relationship between representativeness (perceived similarity) and risk perceptions.  Results:   FDRs reported greater risk perceptions and a greater number of PSA tests than did PM. Risk perceptions predicted increased PSA testing only in path models and was significant only for PM in multi-Group SEM analyses. Family history moderated the relationship between similarity perceptions and risk perceptions such that the relationship between these variables was significant only for FDRs. Recent discussions about prostate cancer mediated the relationships between family history and risk perceptions, and the number of acquaintances men knew with prostate cancer mediated the relationship between family history and PSA testing behavior.

Materials and methods:   A total of 218 human prostate tissues obtained from our institute were assessed: 106 specimens of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and 112 specimens of PCa. The methylation status of APC was analyzed by quantitative pyrosequencing. The association between the APC methylation level and clinicopathological parameters was explored.  Results:   The level of APC methylation was significantly higher in PCa specimens than in BPH specimens (33.3%±20.7% vs. 1.3%±1.8%, p<0.001). The sensitivity and specificity of APC methylation status in discriminating between PCa and BPH reached 89.3% and 98.1%, respectively. Similar results were obtained after stratification by stage, Gleason score, and prostate-specific antigen level. The APC methylation level correlated positively with Gleason score (p trend=0.016).

Thus, the presence of MICA/B on transformed cells contributes to tumor immunosurveillance. Consequently, the proteolytic cleavage of MICA/B is regarded as an important immune escape mechanism of various cancer cells. To investigate the molecular machinery responsible for the shedding of endogenous MICA/B, we analyzed different human tumor entities including mammary, pancreatic and prostate carcinomas. Flow cytometry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) revealed that all tested tumor cells constitutively expressed MICA and MICB on the cell surface and also released NKG2D ligands into the supernatant. We demonstrate that the ""a disintegrin and metalloproteases"" (ADAMs) 10 and 17 are largely responsible for the generation of soluble MICA/B. Pharmacological inhibition of metalloproteases reduced the level of released MICA/B and increased cell surface expression. Studies using RNA interference not only revealed a prominent role of ADAM10 and ADAM17 in NKG2D ligand shedding but also a tumor cell-specific role of ADAM10 and/or ADAM17 in shedding of MICA or MICB. Moreover, we report that in the prostate carcinoma cell line PC-3, MICA was not shed at all but rather was secreted in exosomes.

In this study, we examined the role of insulin-like growth factor receptor-1 (IGF-1R) signaling in MET activation, focusing on prostate cancer cells. Stimulation of the prostate cancer cell line PC3 with IGF-1 induces a delayed phosphorylation of MET at multiple sites (indicative of full activation), reaching a maximum 18 hr after IGF-1 addition. MET activation does not require the sole MET ligand hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), but does require transcription to occur. Furthermore, direct injection of IGF-1 is sufficient to induce MET activation in vivo, in a PC3 xenograft model. Pharmacologic or genetic inhibition of the tyrosine kinase, Src, abolishes MET phosphorylation, and expression of activated Src is sufficient to induce Met phosphorylation in the absence of IGF-1 stimulation. Activated MET is essential for IGF-1-mediated increased migration of PC3 cells, demonstrating an important biologic effect of IGF-1-mediated MET activation. Finally, we demonstrate that IGF-1-induced delayed MET activation occurs in multiple cell lines which express both the receptors, suggesting that IGF-1R-mediated MET activation may contribute to tumorigenic properties of multiple cancer types when both growth factor receptors are expressed. The results further suggest that MET may be activated by multiple receptor tyrosine kinase receptors, and dual targeting of these receptors may be important therapeutically.""","""['Andreas Varkaris', 'Sanchaika Gaur', 'Nila U Parikh', 'Jian H Song', 'Farshid Dayyani', 'Jung-Kang Jin', 'Christopher J Logothetis', 'Gary E Gallick']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Int J Cancer""","""['Combined Inhibition of IGF-1R/IR and Src family kinases enhances antitumor effects in prostate cancer by decreasing activated survival pathways.', 'Targeting the insulin-like growth factor receptor and Src signaling network for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer.', 'The interaction of protein-tyrosine phosphatase α (PTPα) and RACK1 protein enables insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1)-stimulated Abl-dependent and -independent tyrosine phosphorylation of PTPα.', 'Something old, something new and something borrowed: emerging paradigm of insulin-like growth factor type 1 receptor (IGF-1R) signaling regulation.', 'Bad to the Bone: The Role of the Insulin-Like Growth Factor Axis in Osseous Metastasis.', 'Potential role of IGF-1/GLP-1 signaling activation in intracerebral hemorrhage.', 'Enhanced Wild-Type MET Receptor Levels in Mouse Hepatocytes Attenuates Insulin-Mediated Signaling.', 'The Hippo effector YAP1/TEAD1 regulates EPHA3 expression to control cell contact and motility.', 'Insulin-like Growth Factor-1 Influences Prostate Cancer Cell Growth and Invasion through an Integrin α3, α5, αV, and β1 Dependent Mechanism.', 'The Role of HGF/MET Signaling in Metastatic Uveal Melanoma.']"""

Using human prostate cancer specimens, the authors have previously shown that elevated expression levels of 12-lipoxygenase (12-LOX) occurred more frequently in advanced stage, high-grade prostate cancer, suggesting that 12-LOX expression is associated with carcinoma progression and invasion. Previous reports from their group and others have shown that 12-LOX is a positive modulator of invasion and metastasis; however, the mechanism remains unclear. In this work, a new link between 12-LOX and the matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) in prostate cancer angiogenesis is reported. This study demonstrated that overexpression of 12-LOX in prostate cancer PC-3 cells resulted in elevated expression of MMP9 mRNA, protein and secretion. Exogenous addition of 12(S)-hydroxy eicosatetraenoic acid, the sole and stable end product of arachidonic acid metabolism by 12-LOX, is able to increase MMP9 expression in wild-type PC-3 cells. Furthermore, using pharmacological and genetic inhibition approaches, it was found that 12-LOX activates phosphoinositol 3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt, which results in nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB)-driven MMP9 expression, ensuing in enhanced chemoattraction of endothelial cells. Specific inhibitors of 12-LOX, PI3K or NF-κB inhibited MMP9 expression in 12-LOX-expressing PC-3 cells and resulted in the blockade of the migratory ability of endothelial cells. In summary, the authors have identified a new pathway by which overexpression of 12-LOX in prostate cancer cells leads to augmented production of MMP9 via activation of PI3K/Akt/NF-κB signaling. The role of 12-LOX-mediated MMP9 secretion in endothelial cell migration may account for the proangiogenic function of 12-LOX in prostate cancer.""","""['Ashok-kumar Dilly', 'Prasanna Ekambaram', 'Yande Guo', 'Yinlong Cai', 'Stephanie C Tucker', 'Rafael Fridman', 'Mustapha Kandouz', 'Kenneth V Honn']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Int J Cancer""","""['Erratum.', 'Platelet-type 12-lipoxygenase activates NF-kappaB in prostate cancer cells.', 'Metastatic function of BMP-2 in gastric cancer cells: the role of PI3K/AKT, MAPK, the NF-κB pathway, and MMP-9 expression.', '12-Lipoxygenase and the regulation of hypoxia-inducible factor in prostate cancer cells.', 'Emerging Role and Clinicopathological Significance of AEG-1 in Different Cancer Types: A Concise Review.', 'Role of the 12-lipoxygenase pathway in diabetes pathogenesis and complications.', 'The TRPM4 channel inhibitor 9-phenanthrol alleviates cerebral edema after traumatic brain injury in rats.', 'lncRNA MEG3 Inhibits the Proliferation and Growth of Glioma Cells by Downregulating Bcl-xL in the PI3K/Akt/NF-κB Signal Pathway.', 'Extracellular vesicles in β cell biology: Role of lipids in vesicle biogenesis, cargo, and intercellular signaling.', 'Inflammation and Cancer: From the Development of Personalized Indicators to Novel Therapeutic Strategies.', 'Molecular Mechanisms and Clinical Challenges of Glioma Invasion.']"""

The aim of this study was to determine whether SWI quantitative data can differentiate between benign and malignant areas within prostate glands in men suspected of prostate cancer (PCa).  Methods:   We conducted a protocol-based, prospective, prebiopsy quantitative SWI of prostate glands in 50 unscreened men suspected of prostate cancer between July 2011 and May 2012. The ultrasound image of whole prostate gland was arbitrarily divided into 12 zones for sampling biopsies, as is carried out in routine clinical practice. Each region was imaged by grey scale and SWI imaging techniques. Each region was further biopsied irrespective of findings of grey scale or SWI on ultrasound. Additional biopsies were taken if SWI abnormal area was felt to be outside of these 12 zones. Quantitative assessment of SWI abnormal areas was obtained in kilopascals (kPa) from abnormal regions shown by SWI and compared with histopathology. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and likelihood ratios were calculated for SWI (histopathology was a reference standard).  Results:   Fifty patients, with a mean age of 69 ± 6.2 years, were recruited into the study. Thirty-three (66%) patients were diagnosed with PCa, while an additional 4 (8%) had atypia in at least one of the 12 prostate biopsies. Thirteen (26%) patients had a benign biopsy. Data analysed per core for SWI findings showed that for patients with PSA <20 μg/L, the sensitivity and specificity of SWI for PCa detection were 0.9 and 0.88, respectively, while in patients with PSA >20 μg/L, the sensitivity and specificity were 0.93 and 0.93, respectively. In addition, PCa had significantly higher stiffness values compared to benign tissues (p <0.05), with a trend toward stiffness differences in different Gleason grades.

At older ages, most teeth are extracted due to periodontal disease, which is per se another BP-ONJ trigger factor. The aim of this study was to evaluate the periodontal status of BP-ONJ patients using panoramic radiographs compared to a control.  Materials and methods:   All patients treated for BP-ONJ up to January 1, 2010 comprised the study. The very first panoramic radiograph was analyzed. The number of remaining teeth and the radiographic bone loss from the cemento-enamel junction to the crestal bone were measured. For each patient, one control was analyzed (matching for gender and age).  Results:   One hundred twenty-nine BP-ONJ panoramic radiographs and 129 controls were analyzed (68 women, 61 men; 67.3 ± 9.7 years; osteoporosis [n = 11], breast cancer [n = 33], multiple myeloma [n = 61], prostate cancer [n = 24]). The average number of remaining teeth was 12.9 ± 8.4 for BP-ONJ and 16.4 ± 9.4 for the control (p = 0.02).

Materials and methods:   This was a prospective study, and informed consent was obtained from all patients. Ten consecutive patients with histopathologically proved recurrent prostate cancer after radiation therapy, without evidence of distant metastases, were treated while under general anesthesia in a 1.5-T MR unit. A urethral warmer was inserted. Cryoneedles were transperineally inserted under real-time MR imaging. Then, a rectal warmer was inserted. Ice ball growth was continuously monitored under MR imaging guidance. Two freeze-thaw cycles were performed. Follow-up consisted of a visit to the urologist, measurement of prostate-specific antigen level, and multiparametric MR imaging at 3, 6, and 12 months. Potential complications were recorded.  Results:   All patients were successfully treated. In one patient, the urethral warmer could not be inserted and the procedure was cancelled. Two months later, the procedure was successfully repeated. Another patient had urinary retention. Follow-up data were available for all patients. A local recurrence or remnant tumor was found in two patients after 6 months and in another patient after 12 months. These three patients underwent successful retreatment with MR imaging-guided focal cryoablation.

Moreover, we studied the coregulator expressions and histone acetylation alteration in cancer and normal cells. Coregulators, coactivators as well as corepressors, play an important role in AR-mediated growth and progression of prostate cancer. There is a competition between coactivators and corepressors for binding on the AR and therefore the changes in coregulators expression and ratio could be important for prostate cancer survival. Our study was focused on two coregulators, SMRT and p300, which interact with AR in multiprotein complex and affect the AR transcription activity. Our data indicate that sodium butyrate has an effect on AR coregulators expression, transcription activity and histone acetylation in cancer cells, but there is only minimal effect in normal cells.

While the mechanisms of ZnPP's anticancer activity remain to be elucidated, it is generally believed that ZnPP suppresses tumor growth through inhibition of HO-1 activity. We examined this hypothesis by altering cellular levels of HO-1 in human ovarian (A2780) and prostate cancer (DU145) cells and found that ZnPP inhibits cancer cell viability through an HO-1-independent mechanism. Neither over-expression nor knockdown of HO-1 significantly alters ZnPP's cytotoxicity in human cancer cells, indicating that HO-1 does not mediate ZnPP's inhibitory effect on cancer cell growth. Consistent with these observations, tin protoporphyrin (SnPP), a well-established HO-1 inhibitor, was found to be much less cytotoxic than ZnPP, and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), an HO-1 inducer, enhanced ZnPP's cytotoxicity.

We hypothesized that modifications to the surface of NPs that preferentially increase their biophysical interaction with the membrane lipids of cancer cells will improve intratumoral retention and in vivo efficacy upon delivery of NPs loaded with a therapeutic gene. We have demonstrated that different surfactants, incorporated onto the NPs' surface, affect the biophysical interactions of NPs with the lipids of cancer cells and normal endothelial cells. NPs surface modified with didodecyldimethylammoniumbromide (DMAB) demonstrated greater interaction with cancer cell lipids, which was 6.7-fold greater than with unmodified NPs and 5.5-fold greater than with endothelial cell lipids. This correlated with increased uptake of DMAB-modified NPs with incubation time by cancer cells compared to other formulations of NPs and to uptake by endothelial cells. Upon systemic injection, DMAB-NPs demonstrated a 4.6-fold increase in tumor accumulation compared to unmodified NPs which also correlated to improved efficacy of p53 gene therapy.

Here, utilizing multiple approaches, we show that c-Jun efficiently inhibits AR activity and the growth of prostate cancer cells. Overexpression of c-Jun inhibits not only the activities of various androgen-responsive promoters but also the transcripts of multiple AR target genes. Interestingly, long-term c-Jun overexpression also down-regulates AR expression at both the protein and mRNA levels.

Men with a prior negative biopsy but persistently elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) pose a diagnostic dilemma, as some harbor elusive cancer.  Objective:   To determine whether use of magnetic resonance-ultrasound (MR-US) fusion biopsy results in improved detection of PCa compared to repeat conventional biopsy.  Design, setting, and participants:   In a consecutive-case series, 105 subjects with prior negative biopsy and elevated PSA values underwent multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and fusion biopsy in an outpatient setting.  Intervention:   Suspicious areas on multiparametric MRI were delineated and graded by a radiologist; MR-US fusion biopsy was performed by a urologist using the Artemis device; targeted and systematic biopsies were obtained regardless of MRI result.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Detection rates of all PCa and clinically significant PCa (Gleason ≥3+4 or Gleason 6 with maximal cancer core length ≥4 mm) were determined. The yield of targeted biopsy was compared to systematic biopsy. The ability of an MRI grading system to predict clinically significant cancer was investigated. Stepwise multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to determine predictors of significant cancer on biopsy.  Results and limitations:   Fusion biopsy revealed PCa in 36 of 105 men (34%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 25-45). Seventy-two percent of men with PCa had clinically significant disease; 21 of 23 men (91%) with PCa on targeted biopsy had significant cancer compared to 15 of 28 (54%) with systematic biopsy. Degree of suspicion on MRI was the most powerful predictor of significant cancer on multivariate analysis. Twelve of 14 (86%) subjects with a highly suspicious MRI target were diagnosed with clinically significant cancer.

Methods and materials:   One thousand forty-five patients with localized prostate cancer were treated with definitive EBRT in conjunction with neoadjuvant and concurrent ADT. A 6-month course of ADT was used (3 months during the neoadjuvant phase and 2 to 3 months concurrently with EBRT). The median EBRT prescription dose was 81 Gy using a conformal-based technique. The median follow-up time was 8.5 years.  Results:   The 10-year PSA relapse-free survival outcome among patients with pre-radiation therapy PSA nadirs of ≤0.3 ng/mL was 74.3%, compared with 57.7% for patients with higher PSA nadir values (P<.001). The 10-year distant metastases-free survival outcome among patients with pre-radiation therapy PSA nadirs of ≤0.3 ng/mL was 86.1%, compared with 78.6% for patients with higher PSA nadir values (P=.004). In a competing-risk analysis, prostate cancer-related deaths were also significantly reduced among patients with pre-radiation therapy PSA nadirs of <0.3 ng/mL compared with higher values (7.8% compared with 13.7%; P=.009). Multivariable analysis demonstrated that the pre-EBRT PSA nadir value was a significant predictor of long-term biochemical tumor control, distant metastases-free survival, and cause-specific survival outcomes.  Conclusions:   Pre-radiation therapy nadir PSA values of ≤0.3 ng/mL after neoadjuvant ADT were associated with improved long-term biochemical tumor control, reduction in distant metastases, and prostate cancer-related death.

Materials and methods:   Using the RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method, 12 European urologists established recommendations (BCJ) for the appropriateness of PBx according to the prostate-specific antigen level, digital rectal examination findings, number of previous negative PBxs, prostate volume, and life expectancy, with and without consideration of the PCA3 scores. These recommendations were applied to 1024 subjects receiving placebo in the Reduction by Dutasteride of Prostate Cancer Events trial, including men with a previous negative PBx, a baseline prostate-specific antigen level of 2.5-10 ng/mL, and a PCA3 test performed before the protocol-mandated 2- and 4-year repeat PBxs. Three scenarios (ie, BCJ alone, BCJ with PCA3, and the PCA3 score alone) were tested for their ability to reduce the repeat PBx rate versus missing Gleason sum ≥ 7 prostate cancer (PCa).  Results:   BCJ with PCA3 would have avoided 64% of repeat PBxs compared with 26% for BCJ alone and 55% for PCA3 alone (cutoff score 20).

Thus, in the present study, anti-cancer mechanism of ginkgetin was elucidated in human prostate cancer PC-3 cells. Ginkgetin suppressed the viability of PC-3 cells in a concentration-dependent manner and also significantly increased the sub-G1 DNA contents of cell cycle in PC-3 cells. Ginkgetin activated caspase-3 and attenuated the expression of survival genes such as Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, survivin and Cyclin D1 at protein and mRNA levels. Consistently, pan-caspase inhibitor Z-DEVD-fmk blocked sub G1 accumulation and cleavages of PRAP and caspase 3 induced by ginkgetin in PC-3 cells.

Methods:   The skeletal involvement from prostate cancer metastases was assessed by both (99m)Tc-diphosphonate bone scan (BS) and (18)F-fluoride PET/CT within four weeks in 24 patients (67.7 ± 5.1 years) suffering from a borderline degree of bone pain for which radionuclide palliation was not shortly planned for administration.

The short-term results from the radionuclide palliation group (evaluated with a visual analogue scale) were compared with the controls.  Results:   Overall, at BS, 7.6 ± 1.4 sites were considered metastatic, involving at least 5 ± 1 body regions. At (18)F-fluoride PET/CT, 116 ± 19 sites presented metastatic involvement with 12/12 body regions concerned.

Materials and methods:   Fourteen urology experts classified 37 urinary function questionnaire items into 3 primary conceptual dimensions (e.g., storage [irritative], voiding [obstructive] and urinary leakage/incontinence) that would best reflect each item's content. In addition, 218 patient participants provided responses to the 37 items. Using classifications by experts to develop the conceptual framework, the structure was tested using confirmatory factor analyses with patient data.  Results:   Expert consensus was achieved in the classification of 31 out of 37 items. Using the 3-factor conceptual framework and patient data, the fit indices for the overall correlated factor model suggested an acceptable overall model fit. The analyses of the separate domains showed acceptable fit for the storage/irritative domain and the leaking/incontinence domain. The dimensionality of the voiding/obstructive domain was too difficult to estimate.  Conclusions:   Our analysis found items that conceptually and psychometrically support 2 constructs (leaking/incontinence and storage/irritative). The consistency of this support between the groups suggests a clinical relevance that is useful in treating patients. We have conceptual support for a third hypothesis (voiding/obstructive), although there were too few items to assess this psychometrically.

Objective:   To determine the incidence and longitudinal pattern of late genitourinary (GU) toxicity and QoL after high-dose, intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT).  Design, setting, and participants:   A total of 268 patients with localized PCa were treated between June 2004 and December 2008 at a tertiary referral center. Median follow-up was 5 yr (range: 3-7.7 yr).  Intervention:   Patients underwent IMRT to a total dose of 86.4Gy; 50% of patients underwent neoadjuvant and concurrent androgen-deprivation therapy.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Patients were evaluated with the prospectively obtained International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) questionnaire. GU toxicity was also scored using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v.4.0; toxicity events were defined as increase over baseline. Differences in increases in IPSS sums and QoL index between baseline IPSS sum and QoL index groups were analyzed using the Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression models were applied.  Results and limitations:   The overall median IPSS sum increase during follow-up was 3 and was less pronounced among patients with severe baseline symptoms compared with those with mild baseline symptoms (median increase: 0 vs 4; p<0.0001). Overall QoL index was unchanged after IMRT but appeared to improve in patients with dissatisfied baseline QoL compared with satisfied baseline QoL (p<0.0001). Fifty-five (20%) and 2 (1%) patients developed grade 2 and 3 late GU toxicities, respectively; however, in 28 of 57 patients (49%), toxicity resolved during follow-up. Even though the IPSS data were prospectively obtained, most patients were not treated within a prospective protocol.  Conclusions:   Late GU toxicity after high-dose IMRT was mild; severe, late GU toxicity was rare. Changes in IPSS sum and QoL index were dependent on the baseline GU function, which might be useful for future patient counseling.""","""['Pirus Ghadjar', 'Andrew Jackson', 'Daniel E Spratt', 'Jung Hun Oh', 'Per Munck af Rosenschöld', 'Marisa Kollmeier', 'Ellen Yorke', 'Margie Hunt', 'Joseph O Deasy', 'Michael J Zelefsky']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Cautious optimism for extreme dose escalation in prostate cancer.', 'Improved toxicity profile following high-dose postprostatectomy salvage radiation therapy with intensity-modulated radiation therapy.', 'A case-matched study of toxicity outcomes after proton therapy and intensity-modulated radiation therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Impact of dose to the bladder trigone on long-term urinary function after high-dose intensity modulated radiation therapy for localized prostate cancer.', 'Transitioning from conventional radiotherapy to intensity-modulated radiotherapy for localized prostate cancer: changing focus from rectal bleeding to detailed quality of life analysis.', 'Late toxicity rates following definitive radiotherapy for prostate cancer.', 'Cone-beam CT delta-radiomics to predict genitourinary toxicities and international prostate symptom of prostate cancer patients: a pilot study.', 'Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) for Prostate Cancer in Men With a High Baseline International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS ≥ 15).', 'Are all prostate cancer patients ""fit"" for salvage radiotherapy?', 'Image-guided dose-escalated radiation therapy for localized prostate cancer with helical tomotherapy.', 'Quality of life worsened the most severely in patients immediately after intensity-modulated radiotherapy for prostate cancer.']"""

Clinical use of XRT for melanoma is often limited by extent of disease and the relative radioresistance of melanoma may limit the effectiveness of XRT. Our group and others have previously shown that resveratrol (RSV) enhances radiation sensitivity in radioresistant prostate cancer cell lines.  Material and methods:   In this study, the effects of XRT in combination with RSV on radioresistant melanoma lines, SK-Mel-5 and HTB-65, were evaluated by assessment of proliferation and apoptosis. Clonogenic assay, comparison of proliferating cell nuclear antigen staining, Quick Cell Proliferation assay, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining and caspase-3 activity assay were used to assess proliferation and apoptosis, as appropriate.  Results:   We found that the percentage of colonies, proliferating cell nuclear antigen + cells and the optical density value of melanoma cells were decreased after addition of RSV to XRT (XRT/RSV). TUNEL + cells and the relative caspase-3 activity in melanoma cells were increased after addition of RSV to XRT (XRT/RSV). We investigated the possible molecular mechanisms of decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis by using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemical staining. The anti-proliferative effect of XRT/RSV correlated with decreased expression of pro-proliferative molecule cyclin B, cyclin D, cdk2 and cdk4. The pro-apoptotic effect of XRT/RSV correlated with decreased expression of the anti-apoptotic molecule FLIP, Bcl-2, and survivin.  Conclusion:   These data suggest that RSV enhances radiation sensitivity of melanoma cells by inhibiting proliferation and promoting apoptosis.

Heterochromatin protein 1 gamma (HP1γ) is a non-histone heterochromatic protein that functions to maintain chromatin stability and is important in embryonic development. Given an interest in the role developmental genes play in cancer, we investigated HP1γ expression in prostate cancer (PCa) and its prognostic associations.  Methods:   Tissue microarrays consisting of benign (N = 96), localized cancer (N = 146), metastatic PCa (N = 44), and HGPIN (N = 50) were immunoflourescently stained for HP1γ and Ki-67. Using a novel, automated quantitative imaging system, VECTRA™, epithelial staining in both the nucleus and cytoplasm was quantified and compared against clinicopathologic variables.  Results:   HP1γ is significantly elevated in HGPIN (80%), localized PCa (76%), and metastatic PCa (98%) compared to benign tissues from both the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments (P < 0.0001). Increased nuclear and total HP1γ expression was associated with Gleason score (P = 0.02 and P = 0.04 respectively). Given known binding to the C-terminus of Ki-67, a co-expression analysis was performed that revealed a correlation between nuclear and cytoplasmic HP1γ and Ki-67 (Pearson Coefficient 0.321 and 0.562 respectively, P < 0.0001). Cox survival analysis demonstrated that cytoplasmic HP1γ expression was an independent prognostic marker and out-performed pathological Gleason score for predicting PSA-recurrence after radical prostatectomy.  Conclusions:   In this first detailed analysis of HP1γ expression in cancer, VECTRA™ demonstrates compartmentalized and total HP1γ protein expression is increased in PCa and that expression correlates with clinical outcomes better than Gleason score. Given the critical role HP1γ plays in chromatin organization and gene expression, it represents a novel prognostic and therapeutic target.""","""['Jon Slezak', 'Matthew Truong', 'Wei Huang', 'David Jarrard']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['High level of androgen receptor is associated with aggressive clinicopathologic features and decreased biochemical recurrence-free survival in prostate: cancer patients treated with radical prostatectomy.', 'Utility of tissue microarrays for profiling prognostic biomarkers in clinically localized prostate cancer: the expression of BCL-2, E-cadherin, Ki-67 and p53 as predictors of biochemical failure after radical prostatectomy with nested control for clinical and pathological risk factors.', 'HER2 expression and gene amplification in pT2a Gleason score 6 prostate cancer incidentally detected in cystoprostatectomies: comparison with clinically detected androgen-dependent and androgen-independent cancer.', 'Prostate cancer Ki-67 (MIB-1) expression, perineural invasion, and gleason score as biopsy-based predictors of prostate cancer mortality: the Mayo model.', 'Lack of association of prostate carcinoma nuclear grading with prostate specific antigen recurrence after radical prostatectomy.', 'An integrative bioinformatics investigation and experimental validation of chromobox family in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.', 'Development and validation of a predictive model for immune-related genes in patients with tongue squamous cell carcinoma.', 'SCAND1 Reverses Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) and Suppresses Prostate Cancer Growth and Migration.', 'Members of the Chromobox Family Have Prognostic Value in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.', 'Analysis of Pan-Cancer Revealed the Immunological and Prognostic Potential of CBX3 in Human Tumors.']"""

Aim of the present study was to assess the impact of positive surgical margins on biochemical relapse after radical prostatectomy, adjusted for pathological stage and Gleason score.  Methods:   We retrospectively evaluated 837 consecutive patients who underwent radical prostatectomy for organ-confined or locally-advanced prostate cancer. Exclusion criteria were: presence of node or distant metastases, neo-adjuvant or adjuvant therapy, and unavailability of full data regarding pathological stage and margin status.

Results:   The median follow up was 54.0 ± 35.0 months. Margin status, prostate-specific antigen and Gleason score significantly predicted biochemical relapse in the pT2 group at multivariable analysis, whereas only pathological stage and pathological Gleason score were significant predictors of recurrence in pT3a patients. There were no significant differences in biochemical disease-free survival among pT2 with positive margins patients and pT3a patients (with or without positive surgical margins). Pathological Gleason score was the only significant predictor of biochemical relapse in patients with negative and positive margins, regardless of the pathological stage.  Conclusions:   pT2 patients with positive surgical margins and pT3a (with or without positive margins) seem to have similar biochemical disease-free survival. Positive margins and pathological stage might be insufficient clinical predictors.

Materials and methods:   From a cohort of 83 patients with suspicion of local recurrence based on prostate-specific antigen (PSA) kinetics who were imaged on a 3-T MRI unit using an identical protocol including the three functional sequences with an endorectal coil, we selected 60 patients (group A, 28 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy; group B, 32 patients who underwent external-beam radiation) who had local recurrence ascertained on the basis of a transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy results and a reduction in PSA level after salvage therapy.  Results:   All patients presented with a local relapse. Sensitivity with T2-weighted MRI and 3D (1)H-MRS sequences was 57% and 53%, respectively, for group A and 71% and 78%, respectively, for group B. DCE-MRI alone showed a sensitivity of 100% and 96%, respectively, for groups A and B. DWI alone had a higher sensitivity for group B (96%) than for group A (71%). The combination of T2-weighted imaging plus DWI plus DCE-MRI provided a sensitivity as high as 100% in group B.  Conclusion:   The performance of functional imaging sequences for detecting recurrence is different after radical prostatectomy and external-beam radiotherapy. DCE-MRI is a valid and efficient tool to detect prostate cancer recurrence in radical prostatectomy as well as in external-beam radiotherapy. The combination of DCE-MRI and DWI is highly efficient after radiation therapy. Three-dimensional (1)H-MRS needs to be improved.

To date, there have been conflicting reports on the role of FoxA1 in prostate cancer progression and prognosis. With recent discoveries of recurrent FoxA1 mutations in human prostate tumors, comprehensive understanding of FoxA1 function has become very important. Here, through genomic analysis, we reveal that FoxA1 regulates two distinct oncogenic processes via disparate mechanisms. FoxA1 induces cell growth requiring the AR pathway. On the other hand, FoxA1 inhibits cell motility and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) through AR-independent mechanism directly opposing the action of AR signaling. Using orthotopic mouse models, we further show that FoxA1 inhibits prostate tumor metastasis in vivo. Concordant with these contradictory effects on tumor progression, FoxA1 expression is slightly upregulated in localized prostate cancer wherein cell proliferation is the main feature, but is remarkably downregulated when the disease progresses to metastatic stage for which cell motility and EMT are essential. Importantly, recently identified FoxA1 mutants have drastically attenuated ability in suppressing cell motility. Taken together, our findings illustrate an AR-independent function of FoxA1 as a metastasis inhibitor and provide a mechanism by which recurrent FoxA1 mutations contribute to prostate cancer progression.""","""['Hong-Jian Jin', 'Jonathan C Zhao', 'Irene Ogden', 'Raymond C Bergan', 'Jindan Yu']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Cancer Res""","""['FOXA1 regulates androgen receptor variant activity in models of castrate-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Pioneer of prostate cancer: past, present and the future of FOXA1.', 'FOXA1 modulates EAF2 regulation of AR transcriptional activity, cell proliferation, and migration in prostate cancer cells.', 'FOXA1 promotes tumor progression in prostate cancer via the insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 pathway.', 'FOXA1: a transcription factor with parallel functions in development and cancer.', 'Cellular specificity of androgen receptor, coregulators, and pioneer factors in prostate cancer.', 'LSD1 Inhibition Disrupts Super-Enhancer-Driven Oncogenic Transcriptional Programs in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'An Integrated Study on the Differential Expression of the FOX Gene Family in Cancer and Their Response to Chemotherapy Drugs.', 'Integrated analysis reveals FOXA1 and Ku70/Ku80 as targets of ivermectin in prostate cancer.', 'FOXA1 in prostate cancer.']"""

The immune cells recruited at prostate inflammatory lesions and myofibroblasts may contribute to the release of numerous pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines that in turn can promote the oxidative stress, genomic instability and proliferation of epithelial cells. The accumulation of additional genetic and/or epigenetic alterations in prostatic stem/progenitor cells may subsequently culminate to their malignant transformation and PC initiation and progression and more particularly with advancing age.

Here, we report that MED1 is overexpressed in the epithelium of clinically localized human prostate cancer patients, which correlated with elevated cellular proliferation. In a Nkx3.1:Pten mutant mouse model of prostate cancer that recapitulates the human disease, MED1 protein levels were markedly elevated in the epithelium of both invasive and castration-resistant adenocarcinoma prostate tissues. Mechanistic evidence showed that hyperactivated ERK and/or AKT signaling pathways promoted MED1 overexpression in prostate cancer cells. Notably, ectopic MED1 overexpression in prostate cancer xenografts significantly promoted tumor growth in nude mice.

Subsequent studies however were unable to replicate these findings, and there is now compelling evidence that the virus evolved through rare retroviral recombination events in human tumor cell lines established through murine xenograft experiments. There is also no direct evidence that XMRV infection has any functional effects that contribute to tumor pathogenesis.  Results:   Herein we describe an additional xenotropic MLV, ""B4rv"", found in a cell line derived from xenograft experiments with the human prostate cancer LNCaP cell line. When injected subcutaneously in nude mice, LNCaP cells infected with XMRV or B4rv formed larger tumors that were highly hemorrhagic and displayed poor pericyte/smooth muscle cell (SMC) investment, markers of increased metastatic potential. Conditioned media derived from XMRV- or B4rv-infected LNCaPs, but not an amphotropic MLV control virus infected LNCaPs, profoundly decreased expression of marker genes in cultured SMC, consistent with inhibition of SMC differentiation/maturation. Similar effects were seen with a chimeric virus of the amphotropic MLV control virus containing the XMRV env gene, but not with an XMRV chimeric virus containing the amphotropic MLV env gene. UV-inactivated XMRV and pseudovirions that were pseudotyped with XMRV envelope protein also produce conditioned media that down-regulated SMC marker gene expression in vitro.  Conclusions:   Together these results indicate that xenotropic MLV envelope proteins are sufficient to induce the production of factors by tumor cells that suppress vascular SMC differentiation, providing evidence for a novel mechanism by which xenotropic MLVs might alter tumor pathogenesis by disrupting tumor vascular maturation. Although it is highly unlikely that either XMRV or B4Rv themselves infect humans and are pathogenic, the results suggest that xenograft approaches commonly used in the study of human cancer promote the evolution of novel retroviruses with pathogenic properties.""","""['Meera Murgai', 'James Thomas', 'Olga Cherepanova', 'Krista Delviks-Frankenberry', 'Paul Deeble', 'Vinay K Pathak', 'David Rekosh', 'Gary Owens']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Retrovirology""","""['Phylogenetic and biological analysis of a laboratory-generated gammaretrovirus xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus (XMRV).', 'Characterization of retroviral and lentiviral vectors pseudotyped with xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus envelope glycoprotein.', 'Androgen-independent proliferation of LNCaP prostate cancer cells infected by xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus.', 'The tale of xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus.', 'Distribution of xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus (XMRV) infection in chronic fatigue syndrome and prostate cancer.', 'The saga of XMRV: a virus that infects human cells but is not a human virus.', 'Generation of multiple replication-competent retroviruses through recombination between PreXMRV-1 and PreXMRV-2.']"""

Inflammatory responses to cancer can also contribute directly to oncogenesis. Since the immune system is hardwired to protect the host, there is a possibility that cancers, regardless of their histological origins, endow themselves with a common and shared inflammatory cancer-associated molecular pattern (iCAMP) to promote oncoinflammation. However, the definition of iCAMP has not been conceptually and experimentally investigated.  Methods and findings:   Genome-wide cDNA expression data was analyzed for 221 normal and 324 cancer specimens from 7 cancer types: breast, prostate, lung, colon, gastric, oral and pancreatic. A total of 96 inflammatory genes with consistent dysregulation were identified, including 44 up-regulated and 52 down-regulated genes. Protein expression was confirmed by immunohistochemistry for some of these genes. The iCAMP contains proteins whose roles in cancer have been implicated and others which are yet to be appreciated. The clinical significance of many iCAMP genes was confirmed in multiple independent cohorts of colon and ovarian cancer patients. In both cases, better prognosis correlated strongly with high CXCL13 and low level of GREM1, LOX, TNFAIP6, CD36, and EDNRA. An ""Inflammatory Gene Integrated Score"" was further developed from the combination of 18 iCAMP genes in ovarian cancer, which predicted overall survival. Noticeably, as a selective nuclear import protein whose immuno-regulatory function just begins to emerge, karyopherin alpha 2 (KPNA2) is uniformly up-regulated across cancer types. For the first time, the cancer-specific up-regulation of KPNA2 and its clinical significance were verified by tissue microarray analysis in colon and head-neck cancers.  Conclusion:   This work defines an inflammatory signature shared by seven epithelial cancer types and KPNA2 as a consistently up-regulated protein in cancer. Identification of iCAMP may not only serve as a novel biomarker for prognostication and individualized treatment of cancer, but also have significant biological implications.""","""['Saleh M Rachidi', 'Tingting Qin', 'Shaoli Sun', 'W Jim Zheng', 'Zihai Li']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Karyopherin alpha 2 is a novel prognostic marker and a potential therapeutic target for colon cancer.', 'Low cytoplasmic and nuclear KPNA2 expression in radiotherapy-treated head and neck squamous cell cancer is associated with an adverse outcome.', 'Molecular profiling of laser-microdissected matched tumor and normal breast tissue identifies karyopherin alpha2 as a potential novel prognostic marker in breast cancer.', 'Integrative data mining and meta-analysis to investigate the prognostic role of microRNA-200 family in various human malignant neoplasms: A consideration on heterogeneity.', 'Novel roles of karyopherin subunit alpha 2 in hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'Expression sites of immunohistochemistry markers in oral diseases - A scoping review.', 'Lipid Handling Protein Gene Expression in Colorectal Cancer: CD36 and Targeting miRNAs.', 'Multimerin-1 and cancer: a review.', 'CD36 promotes vasculogenic mimicry in melanoma by mediating adhesion to the extracellular matrix.', 'Multi-omics approach identifies germline regulatory variants associated with hematopoietic malignancies in retriever dog breeds.']"""

We found that the CD31-positive and CD34-positive endothelial cells are increased in prostate cancer compared with the normal tissues and that these endothelial cells were decreased upon castration, gradually recovered with time, and increased after prostate cancer progressed into the castration-resistant stage, suggesting a potential linkage of these endothelial cells with androgen deprivation therapy. The in vitro invasion assays showed that the coculture of endothelial cells with prostate cancer cells significantly enhanced the invasion ability of the prostate cancer cells. Mechanism dissection found that coculture of prostate cancer cells with endothelial cells led to increased interleukin (IL)-6 secretion from endothelial cells, which may result in downregulation of androgen receptor (AR) signaling in prostate cancer cells and then the activation of TGF-β/matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) signaling. The consequences of the IL-6→AR→TGFβ→MMP-9 signaling pathway might then trigger the increased invasion of prostate cancer cells. Blocking the IL-6→AR→TGFβ→MMP-9 signaling pathway either by IL-6 antibody, AR-siRNA, or TGF-β1 inhibitor all interrupted the ability of endothelial cells to influence prostate cancer invasion.

However, the role of CCN3 in prostate cancer metastasis to bone is poorly understood. CCN3 was found to be highly expressed in bone metastasis patients and positively correlated with malignancy in human prostate cancer cells. Prostate cancer conditioned medium-induced osteoclast differentiation was inhibited by neutralizing antibody against CCN3. Specifically, CCN3 was found to induce osteoclastogenesis through the receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL)-dependent pathway, and the focal adhesion kinase/Akt/p38/NF-κB signal pathway was found to be involved in CCN3-mediated receptor activator of NF-κB expression and RANKL-dependent osteoclastogenesis.

We also show here that Trop-2 promotes prostate cancer cell migration on fibronectin, a phenomenon dependent on β(1) integrins.

Trop-2 effect is specific as this molecule does not modulate migration on vitronectin, does not associate with the major vitronectin receptor, α(v)β(3) integrin, and does not affect localization of α(v)β(3) integrin as well as vinculin in focal adhesions. We show that Trop-2 enhances directional prostate cancer cell migration, through modulation of Rac1 GTPase activity.

The Oncomine database revealed that these three genes are significantly upregulated in human prostate cancer versus normal tissue and correlate with Gleason scores ≥7. This correlation was further validated for IL-1β by immunodetection in prostate tissue arrays. Our study also shows that the exogenous overexpression of IL-1β in nonmetastatic cancer cells promotes their growth into large skeletal lesions in mice, whereas its knockdown significantly impairs the bone progression of highly metastatic cells. In addition, IL-1β secreted by metastatic cells induced the overexpression of COX-2 (PTGS2) in human bone mesenchymal cells treated with conditioned media from bone metastatic prostate cancer cells. Finally, we inspected human tissue specimens from skeletal metastases and detected prostate cancer cells positive for both IL-1β and synaptophysin while concurrently lacking prostate-specific antigen (PSA, KLK3) expression.

We hypothesized that, in metastatic prostate cancer, androgen deprivation therapy suppression of serum androgen to the castration level may also disrupt serum E2 level, and variation in serum E2 level might play a role in the development of castration-resistant prostate cancer. Our investigation was designed to observe the variation in circulating oestrogen and androgen levels in metastatic prostate cancer patients after combined androgen blockade, and to explore the possible clinical significance. We recruited 105 consecutive metastatic prostate cancer patients who were treated with combined androgen blockade from June to August 2011, and divided them into three groups according to different hormone-sensitivity status, including 58 hormone-sensitive prostate cancers, 27 after failure of first-line hormone therapy (androgen-independent prostate cancer) and 20 castration-resistant prostate cancers. Another 36 consecutive patients with treatment-naive metastatic prostate cancer during the same period were used as controls. Serum testosterone, E2 and E2/testosterone (E2/T) ratio were analysed and compared between the groups. After combined androgen blockade, testosterone was suppressed to a low level, regardless of different hormone sensitivity (p > 0.05). Mean serum testosterone was 4.07, 0.15, 0.11 and 0.09 ng/mL in treatment-naive, hormone-sensitive, androgen-independent and castration-resistant prostate cancer respectively. For each group, mean E2 was 33.06, 9.23, 9.13 and 15.05 pg/mL respectively. Mean E2/T was 9.58, 269.29, 292.06 and 996.67 respectively. Recovery of E2 and increased E2/T ratio were more significantly associated with combined androgen blockade failure, especially in castration-resistant prostate cancer (p < 0.001).

The potential benefit of COX-2-inhibiting non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for cancer treatment is however limited by their well-known cardiovascular side-effects. Therefore, targeting microsomal PGE synthase 1 (mPGES-1), the downstream enzyme in the COX-2-dependent pathway of PGE2 production might be attractive, although conflicting data regarding a potential tumor-supporting function of mPGES-1 were reported. We determined the impact of mPGES-1 in human DU145 prostate cancer cell growth. Surprisingly, knockdown of mPGES-1 did not alter growth of DU145 monolayer cells, but efficiently inhibited the growth of DU145 multicellular tumor spheroids (MCTS). Opposed to MCTS, monolayer cells did not secrete PGE2 due to a lack of COX-2 expression, which was induced during spheroid formation. Pharmacological inhibition of COX-2 and mPGES-1 supported the crucial role of PGE2 for growth of MCTS. The functionality of spheroid-derived PGE2 was demonstrated by its ability to inhibit cytotoxic T cell activation. When investigating mechanisms of spheroid-induced COX-2 induction, we observed that among microenvironmental factors neither glucose deprivation, hypoxia nor tumor cell apoptosis enhanced COX-2 expression. Interestingly, interfering with apoptosis in spheroids triggered a shift towards necrosis, thus augmenting COX-2 expression. We went on to demonstrate that necrotic cells induced COX-2 mRNA expression and PGE2 secretion from live tumor cells. In conclusion, necrosis-dependent COX-2 upregulation in MCTS promoted PGE2 -dependent tumor growth and inhibited activated cytotoxic T cells.

To comprehensively evaluate the association between genetic variation across this region and PrCa, we performed a fine-mapping analysis by genotyping 134 SNPs using a custom Illumina iSelect array or Sequenom MassArray iPlex, followed by imputation of 1094 SNPs in 22 301 PrCa cases and 22 320 controls in The PRACTICAL consortium. Multiple stepwise logistic regression analysis identified four signals in the promoter or intronic regions of TERT that independently associated with PrCa risk.

Recently, it was shown that up to 80% of prostate tumours harbour at least one such gene fusion, and that the most common fusion event, between the prostate-specific TMPRSS2 gene and the ERG oncogene, is a critical, and probably early factor in prostate cancer development. Here we demonstrate the presence and expression of this significant chromosomal rearrangement in prostate cancer stem cells. Moreover, we show that in the prostate epithelial hierarchy from both normal and tumour tissues, TMPRSS2 transcription is subjected to tight monoallelic regulation, which is retained upon asymmetric division and relaxed during epithelial cell differentiation. The presence and expression of TMPRSS2/ERG in prostate stem cells would provide ERG-driven survival advantages, allowing maintenance of this mutated genotype.""","""['Euan S Polson', 'John L Lewis', 'Hamza Celik', 'Vincent M Mann', 'Michael J Stower', 'Matthew S Simms', 'Greta Rodrigues', 'Anne T Collins', 'Norman J Maitland']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Nat Commun""","""['Prostate cancer: TMPRSS2:ERG--the root of the problem?', 'A fusion at the root of prostate cancer.', 'Detection of TMPRSS2:ERG fusion gene in circulating prostate cancer cells.', 'N-myc downstream regulated gene 1 (NDRG1) is fused to ERG in prostate cancer.', 'TMPRSS2:ERG fusion identifies a subgroup of prostate cancers with a favorable prognosis.', 'Fusion in the ETS gene family and prostate cancer.', 'Clinical applications of novel ERG immunohistochemistry in prostate cancer diagnosis and management.', 'Cancer Stem Cells and Prostate Cancer: A Narrative Review.', 'Prostate Cancer Stem Cells: Clinical Aspects and Targeted Therapies.', 'Potential drug discovery for COVID-19 treatment targeting Cathepsin L using a deep learning-based strategy.', 'Understanding and targeting prostate cancer cell heterogeneity and plasticity.', 'A Comprehensive Characterization of Monoallelic Expression During Hematopoiesis and Leukemogenesis via Single-Cell RNA-Sequencing.']"""

Faster model-based algorithms such as the anisotropic analytical algorithm (AAA) by the Eclipse treatment planning system and multigrid superposition (MGS) by the XiO treatment planning system are 2 commonly used algorithms. This study compared AAA and MGS against MC, as the gold standard, on brain, nasopharynx, lung, and prostate cancer patients. Computed tomography of 6 patients of each cancer type was used. The same hypothetical treatment plan using the same machine and treatment prescription was computed for each case by each planning system using their respective dose calculation algorithm. The doses at reference points including (1) soft tissues only, (2) bones only, (3) air cavities only, (4) soft tissue-bone boundary (Soft/Bone), (5) soft tissue-air boundary (Soft/Air), and (6) bone-air boundary (Bone/Air), were measured and compared using the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), which was a function of the percentage dose deviations from MC. Besides, the computation time of each treatment plan was recorded and compared. The MAPEs of MGS were significantly lower than AAA in all types of cancers (p<0.001). With regards to body density combinations, the MAPE of AAA ranged from 1.8% (soft tissue) to 4.9% (Bone/Air), whereas that of MGS from 1.6% (air cavities) to 2.9% (Soft/Bone). The MAPEs of MGS (2.6%±2.1) were significantly lower than that of AAA (3.7%±2.5) in all tissue density combinations (p<0.001). The mean computation time of AAA for all treatment plans was significantly lower than that of the MGS (p<0.001). Both AAA and MGS algorithms demonstrated dose deviations of less than 4.0% in most clinical cases and their performance was better in homogeneous tissues than at tissue boundaries.

STW 5 (Iberogast(®)), a combination of nine plant extracts, is widely used in the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders, including functional dyspepsia and irritable bowel syndrome for which the involvement of an inflammatory etiology is discussed. To investigate the possible anti-proliferative effects, STW 5 and its components have been tested by using the colon-carcinoma cell line HT-29. The analyses have been performed in comparison to acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and diclofenac (Diclo), which are well-known to reduce colon carcinoma risk.  Results:   STW 5 showed significant anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects on HT-29 cancer cells, similar to NSAIDs under test. However, using the LDH assay, STW 5 revealed significantly lower cytotoxicity than Diclo at same concentrations. In contrast to NSAIDs, STW 5 induced COX-1/COX-2, caspase-3 and Bax mRNA expressions in HT-29 and blocked LPS mediated translocation of the NF-κB p65 from the cytoplasm into the nucleus in PMA-differentiated THP-1 macrophages. These effects might be relevant, e.g. for prevention of undesirable side effects like gastric erosions.  Conclusion:   Our data suggest that the pro-apoptotic effect of STW 5 on HT-29 cells is involving multiple targets and is possibly due to an activation of the caspase cascade via mitochondrial destabilization. Active concentrations of STW 5 are, in relation to therapeutic doses, comparable to those of ASA and Diclo, suggesting a similar favorable effect on colon carcinoma risk.""","""['G A Bonaterra', 'O Kelber', 'D Weiser', 'R Kinscherf']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Phytomedicine""","""['In vitro anti-proliferative effects of the willow bark extract STW 33-I.', 'Dicaffeoylquinic acids in Yerba mate (Ilex paraguariensis St. Hilaire) inhibit NF-κB nucleus translocation in macrophages and induce apoptosis by activating caspases-8 and -3 in human colon cancer cells.', 'Anti-inflammatory effects of Phytodolor® (STW 1) and components (poplar, ash and goldenrod) on human monocytes/macrophages.', 'The role of apoptosis in therapy and prophylaxis of epithelial tumours by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).', 'STW 5 (Iberogast®)--a safe and effective standard in the treatment of functional gastrointestinal disorders.', 'Evaluating the Multitarget Effects of Combinations through Multistep Clustering of Pharmacological Data: the Example of the Commercial Preparation Iberogast.', 'Quantification Analysis and In Vitro Anti-Inflammatory Effects of 20-Hydroxyecdysone, Momordin Ic, and Oleanolic Acid from the Fructus of Kochia scoparia.', 'Anti-inflammatory Effects of Herbal Preparations STW5 and STW5-II in Cytokine-Challenged Normal Human Colon Cells.', 'Iberis amara Extract Induces Intracellular Formation of Reactive Oxygen Species and Inhibits Colon Cancer.']"""

In the present study, we aimed to investigate the correlation of microvessel density (MVD), a measure of angiogenesis, with nuclear pleomorphism, mitotic count, and vascular invasion in breast and prostate cancers at preclinical and clinical levels.  Methods:   Samples from xenograft tumors of luminal B breast cancer and prostate adenocarcinoma, established by BT-474 and PC-3 cell lines, respectively, and commensurate human paraffin-embedded blocks were obtained. To determine MVD, specimens were immunostained for CD-34. Nuclear pleomorphism, mitotic count, and vascular invasion were determined using hematoxylin and eosin (HandE)-stained slides.  Results:   MVD showed significant correlations with nuclear pleomorphism (r=0.68, P=0.03) and vascular invasion (r=0.77, P=0.009) in breast cancer. In prostate cancer, MVD was significantly correlated with nuclear pleomorphism (r=0.75, P=0.013) and mitotic count (r=0.75, P=0.012). In the breast cancer xenograft model, a significant correlation was observed between MVD and vascular invasion (r=0.87, P=0.011). In the prostate cancer xenograft model, MVD was significantly correlated with all three parameters (nuclear pleomorphism, r=0.95, P=0.001; mitotic count, r=0.91, P=0.001; and vascular invasion, r=0.79, P=0.017; respectively).

With the advent of gene expression arrays, many microarray studies have been conducted in prostate cancer, but the results have varied across different studies. To better understand the genetic and biologic mechanisms of prostate cancer, we conducted a meta-analysis of two studies on prostate cancer. Eight key genes were identified to be differentially expressed with progression.

Given the relative poor efficacy associated with current cancer vaccines, a novel vaccine platform called DepoVax(TM) (DPX) was developed. C3 tumor-challenged mice were immunized with HPV-E7 peptide in DPX- or conventional-emulsion- (CE-) based vaccine. While control mice showed marked increase in Treg/MDSCs in spleen and blood, in mice treated with DPX-E7 the levels remained similar to tumor-free naive mice. Such differences were also seen within the tumor. Antigen-specific IL10-secreting CD4/CD8 T cells and TGF- β (+)CD8(+) T cell frequencies were increased significantly in CE-treated and control mice in contrast to DPX-E7-immunized mice. Analysis of tumor-infiltrating cells revealed higher frequency of suppressor cells in untreated controls than in DPX-E7 group while the converse was true for tumor-infiltrating CD8 T cells. Immunization of tumor-bearing HLA-A2 transgenic mice with human vaccine DPX-0907, a peptide-based vaccine for breast/ovarian/prostate cancers, showed efficient induction of immune response to cancer peptides despite the presence of suppressor cells.

Patients and physicians must weigh the benefits of currently available therapies against the potential morbidity of these treatments. Herein we describe the development of a gene expression-based continuous risk index and a validation of this test in an independent, blinded cohort of post-radical prostatectomy (RP) patients. A gene expression signature, prognostic for prostate-specific antigen (PSA) recurrence, was identified through a bioinformatic analysis of the expression of 1,536 genes in malignant prostate tissue from a training cohort of consecutive patients treated with RP. The assay was transferred to a real-time RT-PCR platform, and a continuous risk index model was constructed based on the expression of 32 genes. This 32-gene risk index model was validated in an independent, blinded cohort of 270 RP patients. In multivariate analyses, the risk index was prognostic for risk of PSA recurrence and had added value over standard prognostic markers such as Gleason score, pathologic tumor stage, surgical margin status, and presurgery PSA (hazard ratio, 4.05; 95% confidence interval, 1.50-10.94; P = 0.0057). Furthermore, RP patients could be stratified based on the risk of PSA recurrence and the development of metastatic disease. The 32-gene signature identified here is a robust prognostic marker for disease recurrence.

In this study, we investigate the glucose reprogramming using HP (13) C pyruvate MR in a patient-derived prostate tissue slice culture (TSC) model.  Methods:   The steady-state metabolite concentrations in freshly excised human prostate TSCs were assessed and compared to those from snap-frozen biopsy samples. The TSCs were then applied to a perfused cell (bioreactor) platform, and the bioenergetics and the dynamic pyruvate flux of the TSCs were investigated by (31) P and HP (13) C MR, respectively.  Results:   The prostate TSCs demonstrated steady-state glycolytic and phospholipid metabolism, and bioenergetics that recapitulate features of prostate cancer in vivo. (13) C spectra following injection of HP (13) C pyruvate showed significantly increased pyruvate to lactate flux in malignant as compared to the benign prostate TSCs. This increased flux in the malignant prostate TSCs correlated with both increased expression of monocarboxylate transporters (MCT) and activity of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH).  Conclusions:   We provide the first mechanistic evidence for HP (13) C lactate as a prostate cancer biomarker in living human tissues, critical for the interpretation of in vivo studies.

PCa cells cocultured with PrSC showed reduced AKT phosphorylation more than with PCaSC. PCa cells cocultured with PrSC whose SPARC was knocked-down restored AKT phosphorylation. Moreover, PCa cells treated with SPARC led to reduced AKT phosphorylation. Immunoprecipitation with SPARC revealed interaction of SPARC and integrin β1 in PCa cells. Inhibited proliferation and migration of PCa cells by SPARC was restored by integrin β1 neutralizing antibody.

This study evaluated whether HGPIN was located close to PCa in whole radical prostatectomy specimens (RPSs).  Materials and methods:   We evaluated 1,374 prostate specimens from 1999 to 2010 using a cMDX-based map model of the prostate. The distribution of 10,439 PCa foci was analyzed and visualized on a heat map. The color gradient of the heat map was reduced to six colors representing the frequency classification of the relative frequency of PCa using an image posterization effect. We defined 22 regions in the prostate according to the frequency of PCa occurrence. Seven hundred ninety RPSs containing 6,374 PCa foci and 4,502 HGPIN foci were evaluated. The topographical association between PCa and HGPIN in the RPSs was analyzed by estimating the frequencies of PCa and HGPIN in 22 regions. A logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the odds ratios of HGPIN for the presence of PCa in 22 regions.  Results:   Fifty-eight percent of PCa specimens included HGPIN and had significantly more favorable Gleason scores, lower PSA levels and smaller relative tumor volumes than isolated PCa specimens. HGPIN (68%) and PCa (69%) were predominantly localized to the apical half of the prostate. HGPIN was mainly concentrated in the peripheral zone medial to regions with high PCa frequencies. Upon logistic regression analysis, HGPIN was a significant predictor of PCa co-existence in 11 regions.  Conclusions:   HGPIN was located adjacent to PCa in whole RPSs.

Because of their specific expression signature and their associations with tumor aggressiveness and poor outcomes, CT genes are considered to be useful biomarkers and they are also targets for the development of new anti-cancer immunotherapies. The aim of this study was to identify novel CT genes associated with hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (HSPC), and castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).  Methods:   To identify novel CT genes we screened genes for which transcripts were detected by RNA profiling specifically in normal testis and in either HSPC or CRPC as compared to normal prostate and 44 other healthy tissues using GeneChips. The expression and clinicopathological significance of a promising candidate--NR6A1--was examined in HSPC, CRPC, and metastatic site samples using tissue microarrays.  Results:   We report the identification of 98 genes detected in CRPC, HSPC and testicular samples but not in the normal controls. Among them, cellular levels of NR6A1 were found to be higher in HSPC compared to normal prostate and further increased in metastatic lesions and CRPC. Furthermore, increased NR6A1 immunoreactivity was significantly associated with a high Gleason score, advanced pT stage and cancer cell proliferation.  Conclusions:   Our results show that cellular levels of NR6A1 are correlated with disease progression in PCa.

However, it is only temporarily efficient. After a few months or years, the tumor relapses despite the absence of androgenic stimulation: a state referred to as hormone-refractory prostate cancer (HRPCa). Although autophagy confers chemoresistance in some cancers, its role in the development of HRPCa remains unknown.  Methods:   Autophagic flux was assayed by GFP-LC3 clustering, by LC3-I to LC3-II conversion and transmission electron microscopy. Cell death was detected by sub-G1 quantification and concomitant measurement of transmembrane mitochondrial potential and plasma membrane permeabilization. Inhibition of autophagy was achieved by siRNAs and pharmacological inhibitors.  Results:   Androgen deprivation or treatment with the anti-androgen bicalutamide promoted autophagy in HRPCa-derived LNCaP cells. This effect was dramatically reduced after depletion of Atg5 and Beclin-1, two canonical autophagy genes, and was associated with an inhibition of the androgen-induced mTOR pathway. The depletion of Atg5 and Beclin-1 significantly increased the level of cell death induced by androgen deprivation or bicalutamide. Finally, the safe anti-malarial drug chloroquine, an inhibitor of autophagy, dramatically increased cell death after androgen deprivation or bicalutamide treatment.  Conclusion:   Taken together, our data suggest that autophagy is a protective mechanism against androgen deprivation in HRPCa cells and that chloroquine could restore hormone dependence. This set of data could lead to the development of new therapeutic strategy against HRPCa.""","""['Benoît Boutin', 'Nicolas Tajeddine', 'Patrick Vandersmissen', 'Nadège Zanou', 'Monique Van Schoor', 'Ludivine Mondin', 'Pierre J Courtoy', 'Bertrand Tombal', 'Philippe Gailly']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Prostate cancer: Could an antimalarial drug delay the onset of CRPC?', 'Carbidopa enhances antitumoral activity of bicalutamide on the androgen receptor-axis in castration-resistant prostate tumors.', 'Antagonistic interaction between bicalutamide (Casodex) and radiation in androgen-positive prostate cancer LNCaP cells.', 'Chronic azacitidine treatment results in differentiating effects, sensitizes against bicalutamide in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells.', 'The use of Casodex (bicalutamide) in the treatment of disseminated prostatic cancer.', 'Complete Response of Metastatic Androgen Receptor-Positive Breast Cancer to Bicalutamide: Case Report and Review of the Literature.', 'Multi-omics characterization of autophagy-related molecular features for therapeutic targeting of autophagy.', 'Apalutamide and autophagy inhibition in a xenograft mouse model of human prostate cancer.', 'Targeting autophagy in prostate cancer: preclinical and clinical evidence for therapeutic response.', 'The HeyL-Aromatase Axis Promotes Cancer Stem Cell Properties by Endogenous Estrogen-Induced Autophagy in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Bruceantin targets HSP90 to overcome resistance to hormone therapy in castration-resistant prostate cancer.']"""

Our current study attempted to determine whether aberrant immune cell infiltration would have similar impact on colorectal cancer (CRC).  Materials and methods:   Tissue sections from 100 patients with primary CRC were assessed for the frequencies of focal basement membrane (BM) disruption, muscularis mucosa (MM) fragmentation, and tumor cell dissemination in epithelial structures adjacent and distal to infiltrating lymphoid aggregates using a panel of biomarkers and quantitative digital imaging.  Results:   Our study revealed: (1) epithelial structures adjacent to lymphoid follicles or aggregates had a significantly higher (p<0.001) frequency of focally disrupted BM, dissociated epithelial cells in the stroma, disseminated epithelial cells within lymphatic ducts or blood vessels, and fragmented MM than their distal counterparts, (2) a majority of dissociated epithelial cells within the stroma or vascular structures were immediately subjacent to or physically associated with infiltrating immune cells, (3) the junctions of pre-invasive and invasive lesions were almost exclusively located at sites adjacent to lymphoid follicles or aggregates, (4) infiltrating immune cells were preferentially associated with epithelial capsules that show distinct degenerative alterations, and (5) infiltrating immune cells appeared to facilitate tumor stem cell proliferation, budding, and dissemination.  Conclusions:   Aberrant immune cell infiltration may have the same destructive impact on the capsule of all epithelium-derived tumors.

We determined age-stratified associations of baldness with prostate cancer occurrence and severity defined by high stage (T3/T4) or high grade (Gleason 7+.) Associations of androgen metabolism genotypes (CYP3A4, CYP3A5, CYP3A43, AR-CAG, SRD5A2 A49T, and SRD5A2 V89L), family history, alcohol intake, and smoking were examined by baldness status and age group by using multivariable logistic regression models.

Results:   For each increase of 5 parts per billion of NO2, as estimated from the original land use regression model in 2006, the OR5ppb adjusted for personal factors was 1.44 (95% CI 1.21 to 1.73). Adding in contextual factors attenuated the OR5ppb to 1.27 (95% CI 1.03 to 1.58). One method for back-extrapolating concentrations of NO2 to 1996 (about 10 years before the index date) gave the following OR5ppb: 1.41 (95% CI 1.24 to 1.62) when personal factors were included, and 1.30 (95% CI 1.11 to 1.52) when contextual factors were added.  Conclusions:   Exposure to ambient concentrations of NO2 at the current address was associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer.

We assessed the relationship between serum testosterone levels after 6 months of LHRHA therapy and disease outcome in a consecutive series of patients with prostate cancer.  Patients and methods:   Serum testosterone levels were measured prospectively in a cohort of patients given LHRHA for 6 months. End points were time to progression (TTP) and overall survival (OS).  Results:   The study population was 153 patients: 54 with metastatic disease and 99 with biochemical failure. In multivariate analysis, adjustment for age, baseline serum prostatic specific antigen (PSA) levels, Gleason score, and disease stage, testosterone levels < 50 ng/dL failed to be associated with TTP and OS. A cutoff of < 20 ng/dL was associated with a nonsignificant lower risk of progression (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0.58; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.30-1.15; P = .12) and a significant lower risk of death (adjusted HR, 0.19; 95% CI, 0.04-0.76; P = .02). Only 25 patients attained serum testosterone levels < 20 ng/dL. Using a receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC), we found that a testosterone value of 30 ng/dL offered the best overall sensitivity and specificity for prediction of death. Serum testosterone levels < 30 ng/mL were associated with a significantly lower risk of death (adjusted HR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.22-0.94; P = .034.  Conclusions:   Serum testosterone levels lower than the currently adopted cutoff of 50 ng/dL have a prognostic role in patients with prostate cancer receiving LHRHA and are a promising surrogate parameter of LHRHA efficacy.""","""['Valentina Bertaglia', 'Marcello Tucci', 'Cristian Fiori', 'Emiliano Aroasio', 'Massimiliano Poggio', 'Consuelo Buttigliero', 'Susanna Grande', 'Andrea Saini', 'Francesco Porpiglia', 'Alfredo Berruti']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Clin Genitourin Cancer""","""['Testosterone levels in patients with metastatic prostate cancer treated with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone therapy: prognostic significance?', 'Effectiveness of cyproterone acetate in achieving castration and preventing luteinizing hormone releasing hormone analogue induced testosterone surge in patients with prostate cancer.', 'Determining dosing intervals for luteinizing hormone releasing hormone agonists based on serum testosterone levels: a prospective study.', 'Should we follow-up serum testosterone in patients with advanced prostate cancer?', 'Luteinizing hormone--releasing hormone agonists: a quick reference for prevalence rates of potential adverse effects.', 'Methods for Evaluating the Efficacy of Medical Castration: A Systematic Review.', 'Overall survival and cancer-specific survival were improved in local treatment of metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Testosterone Therapy in Advanced Prostate Cancer.', ""Subcutaneous in situ gel delivered leuprolide acetate's consistent and prolonged drug delivery maintains effective testosterone suppression independent of age and weight in men with prostate cancer."", 'Effectiveness and Distribution of Testosterone Levels within First Year of Androgen Deprivation Therapy in a Real-World Setting: Results from the Non-Interventional German Cohort LEAN Study.']"""

In addition, the effect of Plk-1 downregulation on the cancer cells chemosensitization to paclitaxel was further assessed. Downregulation of Plk-1 reduced cancer cells viability from 40 to 85% and up to 59% in endothelial cells. Regarding the latter, it compromised their ability to form new tube-like structures, decreasing the formation of network projections up to 46%. This suggested for the first time, PLK-1 as a valuable angiogenic molecular target. In combination with paclitaxel, anti-PLK-1 siRNA chemosensitized non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and prostate carcinoma cell lines, leading up to a 2-fold increase in the drug cytotoxic effect. Moreover, the sequential incubation of anti-PLK-1 siRNA and paclitaxel led to a decrease in the IC50 of the latter up to 2.7- and 4.1-fold, in A-549 and PC-3 cells, respectively. The combination of anti-PLK-1 siRNA with paclitaxel led to cell cycle arrest, increasing the number of cells at the G2/M and S phases to 1.5 and 1.3-fold in PC-3 cells, and to 1.6 and 1.4-fold in A-549 cells, respectively.

A major challenge for gene transfer is systemic delivery of nucleic acids directly into an affected tissue. Ultrasound (US) contrast agents (microbubbles) are viable candidates to enhance targeted delivery of systemically administered genes. Here we show that p53, pRB, and p130 gene transfer mediated by US cavitation of microbubbles at the tumor site resulted in targeted gene transduction and increased reduction in tumor growth compared to DU-145 prostate cancer cell xenografts treated intratumorally with adenovirus (Ad) or radiation alone. Microbubble-assisted/US-mediated Ad.p53 and Ad.RB treated tumors showed significant reduction in tumor volume compared to Ad.p130 treated tumors (p<0.05). Additionally, US mediated microbubble delivery of p53 and RB combined with external beam radiation resulted in the most profound tumor reduction in DU-145 xenografted nude mice (p<0.05) compared to radiation alone. These findings highlight the potential therapeutic applications of this novel image-guided gene transfer technology in combination with external beam radiation for prostate cancer patients with therapy resistant disease.""","""['Rounak Nande', 'Adelaide Greco', 'Michael S Gossman', 'Jeffrey P Lopez', 'Luigi Claudio', 'Marco Salvatore', 'Arturo Brunetti', 'James Denvir', 'Candace M Howard', 'Pier Paolo Claudio']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Curr Gene Ther""","""['Eradication of therapy-resistant human prostate tumors using an ultrasound-guided site-specific cancer terminator virus delivery approach.', 'Recombinant E1-deleted adenovirus-mediated gene therapy for cancer: efficacy studies with p53 tumor suppressor gene and liver histology in tumor xenograft models.', 'Induction of Oxidants Distinguishes Susceptibility of Prostate Carcinoma Cell Lines to p53 Gene Transfer Mediated by an Improved Adenoviral Vector.', 'INGN 201: Ad-p53, Ad5CMV-p53, adenoviral p53, p53 gene therapy--introgen, RPR/INGN 201.', 'Applications of Ultrasound-Mediated Drug Delivery and Gene Therapy.', 'Enhancing Targeted Therapy in Breast Cancer by Ultrasound-Responsive Nanocarriers.', 'Virus-Based Immuno-Oncology Models.', 'Microbubble-mediated delivery of human adenoviruses does not elicit innate and adaptive immunity response in an immunocompetent mouse model of prostate cancer.', 'Expression of p53 and its mechanism in prostate cancer.', 'Ultrasound-stimulated microbubble enhancement of radiation treatments: endothelial cell function and mechanism.']"""

We evaluated the association of dietary patterns and prostate cancer and low- and high-grade subgroups in Jamaican men. In a case-control study, we enrolled 243 incident cases and 273 urology controls in Jamaican clinics, March 2005-July 2007. Dietary patterns were identified using principal component analysis. Four food patterns were identified: a ""vegetable and legume"" pattern, a ""fast food"" pattern, a ""meat"" pattern, and a ""refined carbohydrate"" pattern. Men in the highest tertile for the refined carbohydrate pattern, characterized by high intakes of rice, pasta, sugar sweetened beverages, and sweet baked foods were at increased risk of total prostate cancer [odds ratio (OR) = 2.02; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.05-3.87 (Ptrend = 0.029)] and low-grade disease [OR = 2.91; 95% CI = 1.18-7.13 (Ptrend = 0.019)] compared with men in the lowest tertile. The vegetable and legumes pattern (healthy), meat pattern, or fast food pattern were not associated with prostate cancer risk.

This study aimed to evaluate the association of polymorphisms in three linkage disequilibrium (LD) blocks of the IGF-1 on the survival of metastatic PCa patients.  Methods:   A total of 215 patients with bone metastases at initial presentation were included in this study. The cytosine-adenine (CA) repeat polymorphism and rs12423791 were selected as representative polymorphisms in the LD blocks 1 and 2, respectively. Haplotype in the LD block 3 was analyzed using two tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), rs6220 and rs7136446. Cancer-specific survival rate was estimated from the Kaplan-Meier curve, and the survival data were compared using the log-rank test.  Results:   Cancer-specific survival was significantly associated with the CA repeat polymorphism, rs12423791, and rs6220 (P = 0.013, 0.014, and 0.014, respectively).

Originally approved as immunosuppressive agents preventing allograft rejection, inhibitors of mTOR signaling have recently entered the arena of cancer therapy. Using rapamycin derivative (RAD001) as a prototype inhibitor, we aimed to systematically analyze the molecular mechanisms underlying the pleiotropic effects of mTOR signaling. Using proliferation- and clonogenic survival assays, a preferential sensitivity of microvascular endothelial cells (HDMVEC) followed by fibroblasts and U87 gliblastoma to RAD001 treatment was found. In contrast, lung- and prostate tumor cells demonstrated relative resistance against RAD001 treatment. In co-culture with fibroblasts, RAD001 exerted potent antiangiogenic effects by inhibiting endothelial cell tube formation. Further, RAD001 treatment efficiently prevented tumor growth in U87 tumor xenografts. Integrative transcriptome analysis was performed to decipher the molecular mechanism underlying RAD001 -induced anti-tumor and antiangiogenic effects. The predominant expression pattern was downregulation of genes after RAD001 treatment in all three sensitive cell types. Among the RAD001 downregulated genes, a transcriptional network was discovered enriched for genes related to angiogenesis processes and extracellular matrix remodeling, e.g., VEGF, HIF1A, CXCLs, IL6, FN, PAI-1 or NRP1. Of note, key components of PI3K upstream (PDK1) as well as mTORC2 downstream signaling (SGK1, NDRG) were downregulated by RAD001. Decreased expression of IMPDH and 139 common gene targets between mycophenolic acid and RAD001 suggested in part shared mechanisms underlying their antiangiogenic and immunosuppressive effects. In summary, key genetic participants governing anti-tumor and anti-angiogenic effects of mTOR inhibition were identified.""","""['Sophie Domhan', 'Christian Schwager', 'Quanxiang Wei', 'Stefan Muschal', 'Claudia Sommerer', 'Christian Morath', 'Wolfgang Wick', 'Christian Maercker', 'Jurgen Debus', 'Martin Zeier', 'Peter E Huber', 'Amir Abdollahi']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Curr Pharm Des""","""['Akt and p53 are potential mediators of reduced mammary tumor growth by cloroquine and the mTOR inhibitor RAD001.', 'The mTOR inhibitor RAD001 sensitizes tumor cells to the cytotoxic effect of carboplatin in breast cancer in vitro.', 'Everolimus (RAD001) sensitizes prostate cancer cells to docetaxel by down-regulation of HIF-1α and sphingosine kinase 1.', 'mTOR inhibitor for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'Future directions in the treatment of hormone-sensitive advanced breast cancer: the RAD001 (Everolimus)-letrozole clinical program.', 'Klebsiella pneumoniae infection causes mitochondrial damage and dysfunction in bovine mammary epithelial cells.', 'The Enigmatic Role of Serum & Glucocorticoid Inducible Kinase 1 in the Endometrium.', 'Gene Expression, Network Analysis, and Drug Discovery of Neurofibromatosis Type 2-Associated Vestibular Schwannomas Based on Bioinformatics Analysis.', 'Serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase 1 and the response to cell stress.', 'Modeling and multiscale characterization of the quantitative imaging based fibrosis index reveals pathophysiological, transcriptome and proteomic correlates of lung fibrosis induced by fractionated irradiation.']"""
