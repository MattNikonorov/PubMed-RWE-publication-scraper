However, the in vivo role of PKCζ and its mechanisms of action in prostate cancer remain unclear. Here we demonstrate that the genetic inactivation of PKCζ in mice results in invasive prostate carcinoma in vivo in the context of phosphatase and tensin homolog deficiency. Bioinformatic analysis of human prostate cancer gene-expression sets revealed increased c-Myc transcriptional activity in PKCζ-inactive cells, which correlated with increased cell growth, invasion, and metastasis. Interestingly, PKCζ knockdown or the overexpression of a kinase-inactive mutant resulted in enhanced cell proliferation and invasion in vitro through increased c-Myc mRNA and protein levels and decreased Ser-373 phosphorylation of c-Myc. Analysis of prostate cancer samples demonstrated increased expression and decreased phosphorylation of c-Myc at Ser-373 in PKCζ knockout tumors. In vivo xenograft studies revealed that c-Myc phosphorylation by PKCζ is a critical event in the control of metastasis. Collectively, these results establish PKCζ as an important tumor suppressor and regulator of c-Myc function in prostate cancer.""","""['Ji Young Kim', 'Tania Valencia', 'Shadi Abu-Baker', 'Juan Linares', 'Sang Jun Lee', 'Tomoko Yajima', 'Jing Chen', 'Alexey Eroshkin', 'Elias A Castilla', 'Laurence M Brill', 'Mario Medvedovic', 'Michael Leitges', 'Jorge Moscat', 'Maria T Diaz-Meco']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A""","""['Pim1 promotes human prostate cancer cell tumorigenicity and c-MYC transcriptional activity.', 'Loss of Nkx3.1 leads to the activation of discrete downstream target genes during prostate tumorigenesis.', 'Ezrin mediates c-Myc actions in prostate cancer cell invasion.', 'Interactions between cells with distinct mutations in c-MYC and Pten in prostate cancer.', 'GLIPR1 suppresses prostate cancer development through targeted oncoprotein destruction.', 'Protein kinase Cλ/ι in cancer: a contextual balance of time and signals.', 'Development of a NanoBRET assay to validate inhibitors of Sirt2-mediated lysine deacetylation and defatty-acylation that block prostate cancer cell migration.', 'Methylation-mediated silencing of protein kinase C zeta induces apoptosis avoidance through ATM/CHK2 inactivation in dedifferentiated chondrosarcoma.', 'Glyoxalase 1 and protein kinase Cλ as potential therapeutic targets for late-stage breast cancer.', 'The PTEN Conundrum: How to Target PTEN-Deficient Prostate Cancer.']"""

Experimental design:   Genomic DNA from 39 prostate cancer specimens was hybridized to CpG island microarrays through differential methylation hybridization. We compared methylation profiles between Gleason score and ERG expression status as well as Gleason score stratified by ERG expression status. In addition, we compared results from our dataset to publicly available datasets of histone modifications in benign prostate cells.  Results:   We discovered hundreds of distinct differentially methylated regions (DMR) associated with increasing Gleason score and ERG. Furthermore, the number of DMRs associated with Gleason score was greatly expanded by stratifying samples into ERG-positive versus ERG-negative, with ERG-positive/GS-associated DMRs being primarily hypermethylated as opposed to hypomethylated. Finally, we found that there was a significant overlap between either Gleason score-related or ERG-hypermethylated DMRs and distinct regions in benign epithelial cells that have PcG signatures (H3K27me3, SUZ12) and lack active gene expression signatures (H3K4me3, RNA pol II).  Conclusions:   This work defines methylation landscapes of prostate cancer according to Gleason score, and suggests that initiating genetic events may influence the prostate cancer epigenome, which is further perturbed as prostate cancer progresses. Moreover, CpG islands with silent chromatin signatures in benign cells are particularly susceptible to prostate cancer-related hypermethylation.""","""['Ken Kron', 'Dominique Trudel', 'Vaijayanti Pethe', 'Laurent Briollais', 'Neil Fleshner', 'Theodorus van der Kwast', 'Bharati Bapat']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Clin Cancer Res""","""['Methylation profiling identified novel differentially methylated markers including OPCML and FLRT2 in prostate cancer.', 'Correlation of ERG expression and DNA methylation biomarkers with adverse clinicopathologic features of prostate cancer.', ""Interrogation of ERG gene rearrangements in prostate cancer identifies a prognostic 10-gene signature with relevant implication to patients' clinical outcome."", 'The prognostic role of ERG immunopositivity in prostatic acinar adenocarcinoma: a study including 454 cases and review of the literature.', 'The Genomic Impact of DNA CpG Methylation on Gene Expression; Relationships in Prostate Cancer.', 'The importance of personalized medicine in urological cancers.', 'Chromatin and Epigenetic Dysregulation of Prostate Cancer Development, Progression, and Therapeutic Response.', 'Circulating Tumor Cell Clustering Shapes DNA Methylation to Enable Metastasis Seeding.', 'Distinct transcriptional repertoire of the androgen receptor in ETS fusion-negative prostate cancer.', 'AMPK/α-Ketoglutarate Axis Dynamically Mediates DNA Demethylation in the Prdm16 Promoter and Brown Adipogenesis.']"""

Materials and methods:   We retrospectively analyzed the data of 517 men who underwent transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy between January 2008 and November 2010. Simple and multiple logistic regression analysis were performed to compare the result of prostate biopsy. Area under the receiver operating characteristics curves (AUC-ROC) and calibration plots were prepared for further analysis to compare the risk calculators and other clinical variables.  Results:   Prostate cancer was diagnosed in 125 (24.1%) men. For prostate cancer prediction, the area under curve (AUC) of the ERSPC-RC was 77.4%. This result was significantly greater than the AUCs of the PCPT-RC and the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) (64.5% and 64.1%, respectively, p<0.01), but not significantly different from the AUC of the PSA density (PSAD) (76.1%, p=0.540). When the results of the calibration plots were compared, the ERSPC-RC plot was more constant than that of PSAD.  Conclusion:   The ERSPC-RC was better than PCPT-RC and PSA in predicting prostate cancer risk in the present study. However, the difference in performance between the ERSPC-RC and PSAD was not significant. Therefore, the Western based prostate cancer risk calculators are not useful for urologists in predicting prostate cancer in the Korean population.""","""['Dong Hoon Lee', 'Ha Bum Jung', 'Jae Won Park', 'Kyu Hyun Kim', 'Jongchan Kim', 'Seung Hwan Lee', 'Byung Ha Chung']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Yonsei Med J""","""['Observational study comparing the accuracy/variability between the ERSPC and the PCPT risk calculators for the prediction of significant prostate cancer in patients with PSA <10 ng/mL.', 'European Randomised Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) risk calculators significantly outperform the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) 2.0 in the prediction of prostate cancer: a multi-institutional study.', 'Prostate cancer risk prediction using the novel versions of the European Randomised Study for Screening of Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) and Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) risk calculators: independent validation and comparison in a contemporary European cohort.', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen-Based Screening for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Evidence Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.', 'Do prostate cancer risk models improve the predictive accuracy of PSA screening?

Methods:   We investigated associations between dietary fats and fatty acids and risk of prostate cancer in the NIH-American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) Diet and Health Study. Diet was assessed at baseline with self-administered food-frequency questionnaires. Cases were determined by linkage with state cancer registries. HR and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated with Cox proportional hazards models.  Results:   Among 288,268 men with average follow-up of nine years, 23,281 prostate cancer cases (18,934 nonadvanced and 2,930 advanced including 725 fatal cases) were identified. Total fat and mono- and polyunsaturated fat intakes were not associated with incidence of prostate cancer. Saturated fat intake was related to increased risk of advanced prostate cancer (HRQuintile 5 vs. Qunitile 1 (Q1 vs. Q5), 1.21; 95% CI, 1.00-1.46; Ptrend = 0.03) and fatal prostate cancer (HRQ5 vs. Q1, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.01-2.15; Ptrend = 0.04). α-Linolenic acid (ALA) intake was related to increased risk of advanced prostate cancer (HRQ5 vs. Q1, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.04-1.31; Ptrend = 0.01). Eicosapentanoic acid (EPA) intake was related to decreased risk of fatal prostate cancer (HRQ5 vs. Q1, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.64-1.04; Ptrend = 0.02).  Conclusion:   Our study suggests that the associations of fat and fatty acids differ by prostate cancer severity.

We found that IL11 is a hypoxia-inducible, VHL-regulated gene in human cancer cells and that expression of IL11 mRNA was dependent, at least in part, on HIF-1. A cooperative interaction between HIF-1 and AP-1 mediated transcriptional activation of the IL11 promoter. Additionally, we found that human cancer cells expressed a functional IL-11Ra subunit, which triggered signal transduction either by exogenous recombinant human IL-11 or by autocrine production of IL-11 in cells cultured under hypoxic conditions. Silencing of IL11 dramatically abrogated the ability of hypoxia to increase anchorage-independent growth and significantly reduced tumor growth in xenograft models. Notably, these results were phenocopied by partial knockdown of STAT1 in a human prostate cancer cell line (PC3), suggesting that this pathway may play an important role in mediating the effects of IL-11 under hypoxic conditions. In conclusion, these results identify IL11 as an oxygen- and VHL-regulated gene and provide evidence of a pathway ""hijacked"" by hypoxic cancer cells that may contribute to tumor progression.""","""['Barbara Onnis', 'Nicole Fer', 'Annamaria Rapisarda', 'Victor S Perez', 'Giovanni Melillo']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Clin Invest""","""['Hypoxic signature of microRNAs in glioblastoma: insights from small RNA deep sequencing.', 'BAY 87-2243, a highly potent and selective inhibitor of hypoxia-induced gene activation has antitumor activities by inhibition of mitochondrial complex I.', 'Increased activation of the hypoxia-inducible factor pathway in varicose veins.', 'Molecular targets from VHL studies into the oxygen-sensing pathway.', 'Correlation of expression of hypoxia-related proteins with prognosis in oral squamous cell carcinoma patients.', 'Role of Interleukins and New Perspectives in Mechanisms of Resistance to Chemotherapy in Gastric Cancer.', 'Hypoxia shapes the immune landscape in lung injury and promotes the persistence of inflammation.', 'The IL6-like Cytokine Family: Role and Biomarker Potential in Breast Cancer.', 'JNK-mediated Ser27 phosphorylation and stabilization of SIRT1 promote growth and progression of colon cancer through deacetylation-dependent activation of Snail.', 'The HIF target MAFF promotes tumor invasion and metastasis through IL11 and STAT3 signaling.']"""

Concerns have been heightened by a recent revival in the use of metal-on-metal (MoM) hip prostheses.  Methods:   From a linked database of hospital discharge, cancer registration, and mortality records, we selected a cohort of patients who underwent primary THA (1990-2009) or primary resurfacing arthroplasty (mainly 2000-2009) in Scotland, with follow-up to the end of 2010. Available operation codes did not enable us to distinguish MoM THAs. Indirectly standardised incidence ratios (SIRs) were calculated for selected cancers with standardisation for age, sex, deprivation, and calendar period.  Results:   The study cohort included 71 990 patients yielding 547 001 person-years at risk (PYAR) and 13 946 cancers diagnosed during follow-up. For the total period of observation combined, the risks of all cancers (SIR: 1.05; 95% CI: confidence interval 1.04-1.07), prostate cancer (SIR: 1.07; 95% CI: 1.01-1.14), and multiple myeloma (SIR: 1.22; 95% CI: 1.06-1.41) were increased. These modest increases in risk emerged in the context of effectively multiple tests of statistical significance, and may reflect inadequate adjustment for confounding factors. For 1317 patients undergoing primary resurfacing arthroplasty between 2000 and 2009 (PYAR=5698), the SIR for all cancers (n=39) was 1.23 (95% CI: 0.87-1.68).  Conclusion:   In the context of previous research, these results do not suggest a major cause for concern. However, the duration of follow-up of patients receiving recently introduced, new-generation MoM prostheses is too short to rule out a genuinely increased risk of cancer entirely.""","""['D H Brewster', 'D L Stockton', 'A Reekie', 'G P Ashcroft', 'C R Howie', 'D E Porter', 'R J Black']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Br J Cancer""","""['Midterm risk of cancer with metal-on-metal hip replacements not increased in a Finnish population.', 'Periprosthetic Joint Infection in Hip Arthroplasty: Is There an Association Between Infection and Bearing Surface Type?', 'Increased Mortality in Metal-on-Metal versus Non-Metal-on-Metal Primary Total Hip Arthroplasty at 10 Years and Longer Follow-Up: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'Harris Hip Score and SF-36 following metal-on-metal total hip arthroplasty and hip resurfacing - a randomized controlled trial with 5-years follow up including 75 patients.', 'Understanding outcomes and toxicological aspects of second generation metal-on-metal hip implants: a state-of-the-art review.', 'No increased risk of cancer associated with metal-on-metal or ceramic-on-ceramic procedures compared to other bearing surfaces in patients with total hip arthroplasty: A nationwide linked registry cohort analysis of 167,837 patients.', 'Similar risk of cancer in patients younger than 55 years with or without a total hip arthroplasty (THA): a population- based cohort study on 18,771 exposed to THA and 87,683 controls.', 'A prospective study on cancer risk after total hip replacements for 41,402 patients linked to the Cancer registry of Norway.', 'Risk of mature B-cell neoplasms and precursor conditions after joint replacement: A report from the Haematological Malignancy Research Network.', 'No generally increased risk of cancer after total hip arthroplasty performed due to osteoarthritis.']"""

Central nervous system involvement is unusual and particularly the occurrence of leptomeningeal metastasis (LM) is extremely rare, with few cases described in the medical literature. The clinical presentation is characterized by multifocal neurological deficit and the prognosis is generally dismal, with survival ranging between 3 and 6 months. We report on a patient affected by LM due to prostate cancer who was treated with a combined-modality approach consisting of sequential chemotherapy and radiotherapy.  Methods:   A 70-year-old man was referred to our group for cognitive mental disorder, left-sided frontal headache and nausea; the patient had a previous history of metastatic prostate cancer. LM was diagnosed neuroradiologically with brain MRI and evidence of a detectable level of PSA in the cerebrospinal fluid. He was treated with docetaxel and prednisone for 3 cycles followed by external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) to the whole brain to a total dose of 30 Gy in 10 fractions with a simultaneous integrated boost to the macroscopic disease (total dose of 35 Gy in 10 fractions). No acute toxicity was observed.  Results:   A substantial clinical response was obtained after EBRT with neurological improvement and radiologically stable disease at post-treatment imaging until 10 weeks after radiation. The patient died of sudden general condition deterioration 3 months after EBRT.

Thus, MMP1 overexpression is a poor prognosis marker in a variety of advanced cancers, including colorectal, breast, and lung carcinomas. Moreover, MMP-1 plays a key role in the metastatic behavior of melanoma, breast, and prostate cancer cells. However, functional and mechanistic studies on the relevance of MMP-1 in cancer have been hampered by the absence of an in vivo model. In this work, we have generated mice deficient in Mmp1a, the murine ortholog of human MMP1. Mmp1a(-/-) mice are viable and fertile and do not exhibit obvious abnormalities, which has facilitated studies of cancer susceptibility. These studies have shown a decreased susceptibility to develop lung carcinomas induced by chemical carcinogens in Mmp1a(-/-) mice. Histopathological analysis indicated that tumors generated in Mmp1a(-/-) mice are smaller than those of wild-type mice, consistently with the idea that the absence of Mmp-1a hampers tumor progression. Proteomic analysis revealed decreased levels of chitinase-3-like 3 and accumulation of the receptor for advanced glycation end-products and its ligand S100A8 in lung samples from Mmp1a(-/-) mice compared with those from wild-type. These findings suggest that Mmp-1a could play a role in tumor progression by modulating the polarization of a Th1/Th2 inflammatory response to chemical carcinogens. On the basis of these results, we propose that Mmp1a knock-out mice provide an excellent in vivo model for the functional analysis of human MMP-1 in both physiological and pathological conditions.""","""['Miriam Fanjul-Fernández', 'Alicia R Folgueras', 'Antonio Fueyo', 'Milagros Balbín', 'María F Suárez', 'M Soledad Fernández-García', 'Steven D Shapiro', 'José M P Freije', 'Carlos López-Otín']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Biol Chem""","""['Matrix metalloproteinase Mmp-1a is dispensable for normal growth and fertility in mice and promotes lung cancer progression by modulating inflammatory responses.', 'Matrix metalloprotease-1a promotes tumorigenesis and metastasis.', 'Matrix metalloprotease 1a deficiency suppresses tumor growth and angiogenesis.', 'Mouse matrix metalloprotease-1a (Mmp1a) gives new insight into MMP function.', 'Matrix metalloproteinase-8 functions as a metastasis suppressor through modulation of tumor cell adhesion and invasion.', 'A matrix metalloprotease-PAR1 system regulates vascular integrity, systemic inflammation and death in sepsis.', 'Elucidating Cellular Metabolism and Protein Difference Data from DIGE Proteomics Experiments Using Enzyme Assays.', 'Nanoclay/Polymer-Based Hydrogels and Enzyme-Loaded Nanostructures for Wound Healing Applications.', 'MMP1 drives tumor progression in large cell carcinoma of the lung through fibroblast senescence.', 'The matrix in cancer.', 'In Vivo and In Vitro Mechanical Loading of Mouse Achilles Tendons and Tenocytes-A Pilot Study.']"""

Earlier studies have highlighted this technique as a useful diagnostic tool for the detection of noncutaneous malignancies like breast, prostate and thyroid cancer based on the principle that tumor cells present a higher stiffness compared to the adjacent normal tissue.  Objective:   The purpose of our study was to investigate the value of real-time tissue elastography for the differentiation of benign and metastatic peripheral lymph nodes (LN) in patients with cutaneous melanoma by comparing this technique with conventional B-mode sonography combined with power Doppler sonography (PDS).  Methods:   In this prospective study, 36 melanoma patients (23 females and 13 males, mean age 62.7 ± 11.1 years) undergoing LN excision at the Department of Dermatology and Allergy, University of Bonn, were included between July 2011 and July 2012. Real-time tissue elastography was planned prior to surgery and histopathological examination. Elasticity images had been qualitatively scored for the proportion of stiff areas from pattern 1-5 (soft to stiff) on the basis of a newly defined system for LNs.  Results:   A total of 42 LNs have been removed in 36 patients. Of these 42 LNs, 21 carried melanoma cells and 21 were benign LNs. Significant differences in elastographic patterns were found between metastatic and nonmetastatic LNs. In real-time tissue elastography, 19 (90.5%) of 21 metastatic LNs showed a pattern of 3, 4 or 5. Of all benign LNs, 76.2% had a pattern of 1 or 2 in their elastogram. Sensitivity and specificity of B-mode sonography combined with PDS were 80.9 and 76.2%, respectively, 90.5 and 76.2% for elastography and 95.2 and 76.2% for the combined evaluation.  Conclusion:   An elastography pattern ≥3 was identified as an independent significant factor, predicting a metastatic LN involvement.

Early detection of bone metastases (BM) is critical in the management of patients with high-risk PCa. The aim of this study is to establish a screening model to determine if bone scan should be performed for BM in Chinese patients at the time when PCa is diagnosed.  Materials and methods:   The study included 488 patients who were diagnosed with PCa between 2009 and 2011 at a single center. All patients received bone scans using technetium (99m)Tc methylene diphosphonate at the initial staging. If the bone scan finding was equivocal, computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging was performed to confirm the diagnosis. Age, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) at diagnosis, clinical stage assigned according to the TNM 2002 staging system and biopsy Gleason score were collected in all patients. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify statistically significant covariates and then receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated to identify optimal cut-off values. Using these cut-off values, a formula was devised to calculate an index value for BM screening at diagnosis. The model was cross-validated using the leave-one-out method.  Results:   Of the 488 patients, 65 patients (13.3%) had BM. The area under the ROC curve was 0.87 (95% confidence interval 0.83-0.94). The sensitivity of the cut-off point was 87.7% and the speciﬁcity was 73.1%. Bone scan is needed for all cT4 PCa patients, however, it is also advisable for cT1-T3 PCa patients who have a biopsy Gleason score ≤3 + 4 and a PSA >132.1, and for cT1-T3 patients having a Gleason score of ≥4 + 3 and PSA >44.5.

Time-dependent Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) of incident primary colorectal cancer associated with the use of ADT. Secondary analyses considered cumulative duration of use and specific ADTs.  Results:   The cohort included a total of 21,503 patients, of whom 184 were diagnosed with colorectal cancer during a mean (SD) follow-up 4.0 (3.0) years (rate 2.4/1,000 person-years). Overall, use of ADT was not associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer (HR 0.99, 95 % CI 0.73-1.35). Similarly, no association was observed in terms of duration use, although this secondary analysis may have been limited by statistical power. With respect to specific ADTs, bilateral orchiectomy was the only therapy associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer (HR 2.50, 95 % CI 1.13-5.52).  Conclusion:   Overall, the use of ADT is not associated with an increased risk of incident colorectal cancer. The increased risk observed with bilateral orchiectomy may possibly be due to the prolonged androgen suppression of this therapy.""","""['Jonathan Assayag', 'Hui Yin', 'Serge Benayoun', 'Michael N Pollak', 'Samy Suissa', 'Laurent Azoulay']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Cancer Causes Control""","""['Androgen Deprivation Therapy for Prostate Cancer and the Risk of Venous Thromboembolism.', 'Androgen-deprivation therapy in treatment of prostate cancer and risk of myocardial infarction and stroke: a nationwide Danish population-based cohort study.', 'Androgen-deprivation therapy and the risk of stroke in patients with prostate cancer.', 'Bone health in men receiving androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Increased risk of metabolic syndrome, diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular disease in men receiving androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Risk of colorectal adenocarcinoma in men receiving androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer; a nationwide cohort study.', 'Circulating Sex Hormones and Risk of Colorectal Adenomas and Serrated Lesions in Men.']"""

Methods:   A retrospective analysis of 521 consecutive radical prostatectomy procedures (January 2005 through to December 2011) performed at our institution without neoadjuvant hormonal therapy was performed. Eighty-four patients fulfilled the following criteria-clinical T1 or T2 disease, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level of ≤10 ng/ml, one or two positive biopsies, and Gleason score of <7. Clinicopathological features at diagnosis were compared between patients with and without reclassification after radical prostatectomy.  Results:   Forty of 84 patients (47.6 %) had a Gleason score of ≥7, and 8 (9.5 %) had upstaged disease (≥pT3). Seven patients with upstaged disease also showed upgraded reclassification. Two patients with reclassification showed biochemical recurrence at 59 and 89 months after surgery, respectively. Preoperative parameters evaluated included age, PSA level, PSA density (PSAD), clinical T stage, and number and percentage of positive prostate cores. Among 82 patients with complete data, univariate analysis showed that PSAD (ng/ml(2)) was a significant parameter to discriminate patients with reclassified disease and those without reclassified disease (p < 0.001).

However, there is still significant controversy regarding the order of events of these two changes during the carcinogenic process. We used immunohistochemistry (IHC) to determine ERG and PTEN status, and calculated the fraction of cases with homogeneous/heterogeneous ERG and PTEN staining in a given tumor.  Methods:   Using a single standard tissue section from the index tumor from radical prostatectomies (N=77), enriched for relatively high grade and stage tumors, we examined ERG and PTEN status by IHC. We determined whether ERG or PTEN staining was homogeneous (all tumor cells staining positive) or heterogeneous (focal tumor cell staining) in a given tumor focus.  Results:   Fifty-seven percent (N=44/77) of tumor foci showed ERG positivity, with 93% of these (N=41/44) cases showing homogeneous ERG staining in which all tumor cells stained positively. Fifty-three percent (N=41/77) of tumor foci showed PTEN loss, and of these 66% (N=27/41) showed heterogeneous PTEN loss. In ERG homogeneously positive cases, any PTEN loss occurred in 56% (N=23/41) of cases, and of these 65% (N=15/23) showed heterogeneous loss. In ERG-negative tumors, 51.5% (N=17/33) showed PTEN loss, and of these 64.7% (N=11/17) showed heterogeneous PTEN loss. In a subset of cases, genomic deletions of PTEN were verified by fluorescence in situ hybridization in regions with PTEN protein loss as compared with regions with intact PTEN protein, which did not show PTEN genomic loss.  Conclusions:   These results support the concept that PTEN loss tends to occur as a subclonal event within a given established prostatic carcinoma clone after ERG gene fusion. The combination of ERG and PTEN IHC staining can be used as a simple test to ascertain PTEN and ERG gene rearrangement status within a given prostate cancer in either a research or clinical setting.""","""['B Gumuskaya', 'B Gurel', 'H Fedor', 'H-L Tan', 'C A Weier', 'J L Hicks', 'M C Haffner', 'T L Lotan', 'A M De Marzo']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['Heterogeneity and chronology of PTEN deletion and ERG fusion in prostate cancer.', 'The prognostic value of SUMO1/Sentrin specific peptidase 1 (SENP1) in prostate cancer is limited to ERG-fusion positive tumors lacking PTEN deletion.', 'Genomic deletion of PTEN is associated with tumor progression and early PSA recurrence in ERG fusion-positive and fusion-negative prostate cancer.', 'The prognostic and predictive value of TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion and ERG protein expression in prostate cancer biopsies.', 'Genomic Rearrangements of PTEN in Prostate Cancer.', 'Correlations of PTEN and ERG Immunoexpression in Prostate Carcinoma and Lesions Related to Its Natural History: Clinical Perspectives.', 'MYC-driven increases in mitochondrial DNA copy number occur early and persist throughout prostatic cancer progression.', 'Association of self-identified race and genetic ancestry with the immunogenomic landscape of primary prostate cancer.', 'ETS factors in prostate cancer.', 'Genomic and Clinicopathologic Characterization of ATM-deficient Prostate Cancer.']"""

The aim of this study was to compare the potency recovery rate of patients with clinically localised prostate cancer treated by bilateral nerve-sparing (BNS) RARP or retropubic radical prostatectomy (RRP), and secondarily, the urinary continence recovery evaluation and the oncological efficacy. All patients treated with BNS-RARP or BNS-RRP for clinically localised prostate cancer, performed by a single dedicated surgeon, between January 2004 and December 2008, were enrolled in this non-randomised prospective comparative study. The International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) and erection hardness score (EHS), in the form of a questionnaire, were self-administered to each patient pre-operatively and after 12 months. The presence of surgical margins was considered as oncological outcome measure. Eighty-two patients underwent BNS-RARP while 48 underwent BNS-RRP. For BNS-RARP and BNS-RRP the median operative time was 221 and 103 min, respectively (P<0.001; df=128; t=721.43),and intra-operative blood loss was 280 and 565 ml, respectively (P<0.001; df=128; t=1742.44). At a mean follow-up period of 12.4±2.3 months, 12 patients (25%) in the BNS-RRP group and 22 (26.8%) in the BNS-RARP group were considered potent with or without drugs (P=0.81). Moreover, we did not find any statistically significant difference between the 2 groups in terms of IEFF and EHS scores after treatment (17.21 vs. 16.98; P=0.16 and 2.1 vs. 2.0; P=0.54). On the other hand, statistically significant differences between the 2 groups were found in terms of faster urinary continence recovery and the presence of positive surgical margins (P<0.001, P=0.009). Shorter catheterization duration (7 vs. 3 days) and post-operative hospital stays (8 vs. 4 days; P<0.001) were found in the BNS-RARP group compared to the BNS-RRP group.

Cell survival was determined by clonogenic assay, directly and 24 h after irradiation with doses ranging from 0 to 8 Gy. Irradiation was performed with a Siemens Stabilipan 250 KeV X-ray machine at a dose rate of approximately 3 Gy/min. Survival curves were analyzed using the linear-quadratic model S(D)/S(0)=exp-(αD+βD2). LNCaP cells clearly demonstrated potentially lethal damage repair (PLDR) which was assessed as increased survival levels after delayed plating as compared to cells plated immediately after irradiation. DU145 cells demonstrated only a slight PLDR and PC3 cells did not show PLDR at all.

Objective:   To analyze the nucleic acid quality and quantity isolated from open versus laparoscopic prostatectomies.  Design:   Nucleic acids were isolated from 10 open-obtained and 10 laparoscopic-obtained tissues stored in our prostate sample repository. Nucleic acid integrity was assessed via electrophoresis and polymerase chain reaction amplification of RNA and DNA targets ranging in size from 125 to 939 base pairs.  Results:   The DNA yield, integrity, and polymerase chain reaction amplification were identical between samples obtained from both surgical approaches. The RNA integrity number and yield were similar, as was β-2 microglobulin mRNA amplification up to 652 base pairs. However, 2 of 10 samples (20%) collected robotically showed decreased real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction amplification of prostate-specific antigen messenger RNA, especially with targets larger than 300 base pairs.  Conclusions:   Generally, the quality and quantity of nucleic acids isolated from prostate tissue obtained via open or laparoscopic approaches are equivalent, suggesting that procurement of tissues is appropriate from either procedure.

However, treatment failure persists due to the inability to achieve complete local control of the tumor and curtail metastatic spread. Vascular disrupting agents (VDAs) are a class of promising systemic agents that are known to synergistically enhance radiation, chemotherapy or thermal treatments of solid tumors. Unfortunately, there is still an unmet need for VDAs with more favorable safety profiles and fewer side effects. Recent work has demonstrated that conjugating VDAs to other molecules (polyethylene glycol, CNGRCG peptide) or nanoparticles (liposomes, gold) can reduce toxicity of one prominent VDA (tumor necrosis factor alpha, TNF-α). In this report, we show the potential of a gold conjugated TNF-α nanoparticle (NP-TNF) to improve multimodal cancer therapies with VDAs. In a dorsal skin fold and hindlimb murine xenograft model of prostate cancer, we found that NP-TNF disrupts endothelial barrier function and induces a significant increase in vascular permeability within the first 1-2 h followed by a dramatic 80% drop in perfusion 2-6 h after systemic administration. We also demonstrate that the tumor response to the nanoparticle can be verified using dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a technique in clinical use. Additionally, multimodal treatment with thermal therapies at the perfusion nadir in the sub- and supraphysiological temperature regimes increases tumor volumetric destruction by over 60% and leads to significant tumor growth delays compared to thermal therapy alone. Lastly, NP-TNF was found to enhance thermal therapy in the absence of neutrophil recruitment, suggesting that immune/inflammatory regulation is not central to its power as part of a multimodal approach. Our data demonstrate the potential of nanoparticle-conjugated VDAs to significantly improve cancer therapy by preconditioning tumor vasculature to a secondary insult in a targeted manner. We anticipate our work to direct investigations into more potent tumor vasculature specific combinations of VDAs and nanoparticles with the goal of transitioning optimal regimens into clinical trials.""","""['Mithun M Shenoi', 'Isabelle Iltis', 'Jeunghwan Choi', 'Nathan A Koonce', 'Gregory J Metzger', 'Robert J Griffin', 'John C Bischof']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Mol Pharm""","""['In vivo detection of the effects of preconditioning on LNCaP tumors by a TNF-α nanoparticle construct using MRI.', 'Enhancement of tumor thermal therapy using gold nanoparticle-assisted tumor necrosis factor-alpha delivery.', 'Nanoparticle preconditioning for enhanced thermal therapies in cancer.', 'Vascular disrupting agents: a new class of drug in cancer therapy.', 'Efficiency of recombinant human TNF in human cancer therapy.', 'A Dual Concentration-Tailored Cytokine-Chemo Nanosystem to Alleviate Multidrug Resistance and Redirect Balance of Cancer Proliferation and Apoptosis.', 'Nano-biotechnology in tumour and cancerous disease: A\xa0perspective review.', 'Image-guided percutaneous ablation for lung malignancies.', 'Targeting the Blood-Brain Tumor Barrier with Tumor Necrosis Factor-α.', 'Recent progress in cryoablation cancer therapy and nanoparticles mediated cryoablation.']"""

All patients underwent a bone scan and 18F-choline or 11C-acetate PET-CT at the time of diagnosis or relapse, showing regional and/or distant nodal and bone and/or visceral metastases in 33 and 17 patients, respectively. The median delivered effective dose was 64 Gy. All but one patient received neo-adjuvant and concomitant AD.  Results:   After a median follow-up of 31 months (range, 9-89) the three-year biochemical relapse-free survival (bRFS), clinical failure-free survival, and overall survival rates were 54.5%, 58.6% and 92%, respectively. No grade 3 toxicity was observed. Improved bRFS was found to be significantly associated with the number of OM. The three-year bRFS was 66.5% versus 36.4% for patients with 1 and > 1 OMs (p = 0.031). A normalised total dose (NTD in 2 Gy/fraction, alpha/beta = 2 Gy) above 64 Gy was also correlated with a better three-year bRFS compared to lower doses: 65% vs. 41.8%, respectively (p = 0.005). On multivariate analysis, only the NTD > 64 Gy retained statistical significance (HR: 0.37, 95% CI 0.15-0.93).  Conclusion:   Oligometastatic patients may be successfully treated with short AD and high-dose irradiation to the metastatic lesions. High dose improves bRFS. Such a treatment strategy may hypothetically succeed to prolong the failure-free interval between two consecutive AD courses.""","""['Ulrike Schick', 'Sandra Jorcano', 'Philippe Nouet', 'Michel Rouzaud', 'Hansjoerg Vees', 'Thomas Zilli', 'Osman Ratib', 'Damien C Weber', 'Raymond Miralbell']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Acta Oncol""","""['Factors affecting recurrence rates after prostatectomy or radiotherapy in localized prostate carcinoma patients with biopsy Gleason score 8 or above.', 'Recurrence-free survival rates after external-beam radiotherapy for patients with clinical T1-T3 prostate carcinoma in the prostate-specific antigen era: what should we expect?', 'External beam radiotherapy versus radical prostatectomy for clinical stage T1-2 prostate cancer: therapeutic implications of stratification by pretreatment PSA levels and biopsy Gleason scores.', 'Metastasis-directed therapy of regional and distant recurrences after curative treatment of prostate cancer: a systematic review of the literature.', 'Short-term androgen deprivation therapy for patients with intermediate-risk prostate cancer undergoing dose-escalated radiotherapy: the standard of care?', 'Retrospective Analysis of a Cohort of Patients with Metastatic Bladder Cancer with Metastatic Sites Limited to the Pelvis and Retroperitoneum Treated at a Single Institution between 2009 and 2020.', 'Assessment of oligometastasis status of prostate cancer following combined robot-assisted radical prostatectomy and androgen deprivation versus androgen deprivation therapy alone using PSA percentage decline rate.', 'Oligometastatic Prostate Cancer: Current Status and Future Challenges.', 'The 18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT performance on metastasis status and therapy assessment in oligo-metastasis prostate cancer.', 'Nodal and osseous oligometastatic prostate cancer: a cohort including the introduction of PSMA-PET/CT-guided stereotactic and hypofractionated radiotherapy with elective nodal therapy.']"""

Material and methods:   One hundred and fifty-seven men with NCCN high-risk (T3, PSA > 20, or Gleason ≥ 8) clinically localized prostate cancer treated between 1998 and 2010 met the inclusion criteria for the analysis. Eighty-two were treated with conventional WPRT with a conventionally fractionated sequential boost to the prostate (cRT), with the prostate receiving 75-77 Gy in 1.8-2.0 Gy fractions. Seventy-five were treated with pelvic IMRT with a hypofractionated simultaneous boost to the prostate (hRT), with the prostate receiving 70 Gy in 2.5 Gy fractions. The dose to the pelvic lymph nodes was 45 Gy in the cRT group and 50.4 Gy in the hRT group, both at 1.8 Gy per fraction. Ninety-two percent received neoadjuvant hormonal ablation therapy, typically beginning two months prior to the start of RT.  Results:   Median follow-up was 6.5 years for men receiving cRT and 3.7 years for those receiving hRT. The actuarial rate of biochemical control at four years was 88% for cRT and 94% for hRT (p = 0.82). The rates of early rectal and urinary grade ≥ 2 toxicities were 35% (29 of 82) and 49% (40 of 82) for the cRT group and 36% (27 of 75) and 44% (33 of 75) for the hRT group. The actuarial rate of late grade ≥ 2 rectal toxicity at four years was 25% for the cRT group and 13% for the hRT group (p = 0.037). The rate of late grade 3 rectal complications was 4% (3 of 82) for patients receiving cRT and 1% (1 of 75) for patients receiving hRT.

This study aimed to investigate whether DPP4 genetic variants are associated with baseline PSA levels. A cross-sectional study was performed on 2,074 Japanese men aged between 35 and 69 in the Shizuoka area from the Japan Multi-institutional Collaborative Cohort (J-MICC) Study. Three DPP4 tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were selected for genotyping: rs3788979 (A/G), rs7608798 (T/C), and rs2268889 (A/G). Higher mean serum PSA levels were significantly associated with an increase in the number of the rs7608798 C allele (p for trend = 0.02). A stratified analysis by age groups demonstrated that PSA levels had positive significant trends with the numbers of the minor alleles of rs3788979 or rs7608798 in the oldest group (men aged between 60 and 69) (p for trend=0.004 for rs3788979 and p for trend=0.001 for rs7608798).

Materials and methods:   The study population consisted of 324 patients who prospectively underwent prebiopsy multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging and then 3-dimensional 26-core prostate biopsy at a single institution. We defined transrectal 12-core negative cancer as cancer detected by transperineal 14-core but not transrectal 12-core prostate biopsy. We focused on cancer in the anterior region. Any findings suspicious for malignancy in the region anterior to the urethra on multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging were defined as an anterior lesion on imaging. Significant cancer was defined as a biopsy Gleason score of 4 + 3 or greater, a greater than 20% positive core and/or a maximum cancer length of 5 mm or greater. Associations between an anterior lesion on imaging and transrectal 12-core negative cancer were investigated.  Results:   The overall cancer detection rate on 3-dimensional 26-core prostate biopsy was 39% (128 of 324 cases), of which 28% (36 of 128) were transrectal 12-core negative cancers. An anterior lesion on prebiopsy multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging was identified in 20% of men overall (65 of 324). Of men with and without an anterior lesion on imaging 40% (26 of 65) and 3.8% (10 of 259), respectively, had transrectal 12-core negative cancer. Significant transrectal 12-core negative cancer was observed in 0.4% (1 of 259 men) without an anterior lesion on imaging. Prebiopsy multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging revealed an anterior lesion in 92% of cases (11 of 12) of significant transrectal 12-core negative cancer.

However, whether small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), a class of non-coding RNAs crucial in ribosomal RNA (rRNA) maturation and functionality, are involved in cancer remains elusive. We report that snoRNAs and fibrillarin (FBL, an enzymatic small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein, snoRNP) are frequently overexpressed in both murine and human breast cancer as well as in prostate cancers, and significantly, that this overexpression is essential for tumorigenicity in vitro and in vivo. We demonstrate that when the elevated snoRNA pathway is suppressed, the tumor suppressor p53 can act as a sentinel of snoRNP perturbation, the activation of which mediates the growth inhibitory effect. On the other hand, high level of FBL interferes with the activation of p53 by stress. We further show that p53 activation by FBL knockdown is not only regulated by the ribosomal protein-MDM2-mediated protein stabilization pathway, but also by enhanced PTB-dependent, cap-independent translation. Together, our data uncover an essential role of deregulated snoRNA biogenesis in tumors and a new mechanism of nucleolar modulation of p53.""","""['H Su', 'T Xu', 'S Ganapathy', 'M Shadfan', 'M Long', 'T H-M Huang', 'I Thompson', 'Z-M Yuan']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['Specific small nucleolar RNA expression profiles in acute leukemia.', 'Identification of protein factors and U3 snoRNAs from a Brassica oleracea RNP complex involved in the processing of pre-rRNA.', 'AtNUFIP, an essential protein for plant development, reveals the impact of snoRNA gene organisation on the assembly of snoRNPs and rRNA methylation in Arabidopsis thaliana.', 'Small nucleolar RNA and its potential role in breast cancer - A comprehensive review.', 'Beyond usual functions of snoRNAs.', 'The emerging role of snoRNAs in human disease.', 'The Importance of Being RNA-est: considering RNA-mediated ribosome plasticity.', 'Cryo-EM reconstruction of the human 40S ribosomal subunit at 2.15 Å resolution.', 'The roles of NOP56 in cancer and SCA36.', 'Midsize noncoding RNAs in cancers: a new division that clarifies the world of noncoding RNA or an unnecessary chaos?']"""

The antigen and mRNA levels of PAI-1 were down-regulated in cancer cells, especially in LNCaP and DU-145. In the presence of proinflammatory cytokines, an increase of PAI-1 mRNA levels was observed in PrEC, LNCaP and PC-3, but not in DU-145 cells. Treatment with demethylating agent, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine increased the level of PAI-1 transcript in DU-145 cells and restored the inducing effect of cytokines on PAI-1 expression. An aberrant methylation of PAI-1 promoter in DU-145 and LNCaP cells was shown by methylation-sensitive high resolution melting (MS-HRM) analysis. PAI-1 methylation was also significantly increased in tumor samples (23.2±1.7%) in comparison to adjacent non-tumor tissue (6.0±0.8%).

Our goal was to validate these results in a large independent cohort of PCa patients who underwent radical prostatectomy.  Experimental design:   A set of 1826 fully annotated prostate cancers treated by radical prostatectomy were analysed in a tissue microarray (TMA) format for NF-κB p65 immunohistochemistry-based protein expression. We performed standard Cox proportional hazard regression models for follow-up data, bootstrap procedure for model internal validation, Harrell's concordance index for model discrimination and graphical assessment of predicted versus actual outcomes for model calibration.  Results:   We observed a significant association between an increase in the nuclear frequency of NF-κB p65 and Gleason score (P<0.001), overall BCR (P<0.001) and development of metastases (P=0.001). NF-κB was found to be an independent predictor of BCR (P<0.001, Cox regression). However its contribution to the predictive accuracy of a multivariate model, which included preoperative PSA, Gleason score, extraprostatic extension, lymph node invasion, seminal vesicle involvement and surgical margin status, was modest.  Conclusions:   Our study offers validating results linking NF-κB p65 with disease progression using a large cohort of European men. However, the contribution of NF-κB to a post-surgical predictive model appears modest.

Objective:   To examine whether obesity is associated with enhanced PV growth measured by serial transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) measurements.  Design, setting, and participants:   We conducted a secondary analysis of the REduction by DUtasteride of prostate Cancer Events (REDUCE) trial, which was originally aimed at cancer risk reduction among high-risk men with a single negative prestudy biopsy.  Intervention:   Per-protocol randomization to placebo or dutasteride and mandatory TRUS-guided biopsies at 2 yr and 4 yr.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Percentage change in PV at 2 yr and 4 yr from baseline. We tested its association with baseline body mass index (BMI) groups of <25, 25-29.9, and ≥ 30 kg/m(2) using multivariable linear regression. Secondarily, we tested whether BMI was associated with the likelihood of having no PV reduction among men randomized to dutasteride using multivariable logistic regression.  Results and limitations:   Of 8122 participants, we analyzed 71.8% and 54.5% with complete 2-yr and 4-yr PV data, respectively. In multivariable analysis, men on placebo with BMI ≥ 30 versus < 25 kg/m(2) had enhanced PV growth from baseline (at 2 yr: 17.0% vs 10.7%, p<0.001; at 4 yr: 29.4% vs 20.1%; p=0.001). Men on dutasteride with BMI ≥ 30 versus < 25 kg/m(2) had attenuated PV reduction from baseline (at 2 yr: -14.3% vs -18.5%; p=0.002; at 4 yr: -13.2% vs -19.3%; p=0.001) and higher likelihood of having no PV reduction (at 2 yr: odds ratio [OR]: 1.44; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.08-1.93; p=0.014; at 4 yr: OR: 1.62; 95% CI, 1.18-2.22; p=0.003). We found no significant interactions between BMI and dutasteride on PV change at 2 yr and 4 yr (p interaction ≥ 0.36). No clinical outcomes or effects of weight change were assessed.  Conclusions:   Obesity enhanced PV growth and attenuated PV reduction by dutasteride.

Objective:   We propose a new risk stratification system for intermediate-risk PCa to aid in prognosis and therapeutic decision making.  Design, setting, and participants:   Between 1992 and 2007, 1024 patients with National Comprehensive Cancer Network intermediate-risk PCa and complete biopsy information were treated with definitive external-beam radiation therapy (EBRT) utilizing doses ≥ 81 Gy. Unfavorable intermediate-risk (UIR) PCa was defined as any intermediate-risk patient with a primary Gleason pattern of 4, percentage of positive biopsy cores (PPBC) ≥ 50%, or multiple intermediate-risk factors (IRFs; cT2b-c, prostate-specific antigen [PSA] 10-20, or Gleason score 7).  Intervention:   All patients received EBRT with ≥ 81 Gy with or without neoadjuvant and concurrent androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT).  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed using a Cox proportional hazards model for PSA recurrence-free survival (PSA-RFS) and distant metastasis (DM). PCa-specific mortality (PCSM) was analyzed using a competing-risk method.  Results and limitations:   Median follow-up was 71 mo. Primary Gleason pattern 4 (hazard ratio [HR]: 3.26; p<0.0001), PPBC ≥ 50% (HR: 2.72; p=0.0007), and multiple IRFs (HR: 2.20; p=0.008) all were significant predictors of increased DM in multivariate analyses. Primary Gleason pattern 4 (HR: 5.23; p<0.0001) and PPBC ≥ 50% (HR: 4.08; p=0.002) but not multiple IRFs (HR: 1.74; p=0.21) independently predicted for increased PCSM. Patients with UIR disease had inferior PSA-RFS (HR: 2.37; p<0.0001), DM (HR: 4.34; p=0.0003), and PCSM (HR: 7.39; p=0.007) compared with those with favorable intermediate-risk disease, despite being more likely to receive neoadjuvant ADT.

Data has suggested that HOXB13 expression levels are decreased in colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines indicating this gene may be involved in colorectal tumourigenesis.  Methods:   To evaluate a potential association of this mutation with CRC, we genotyped the mutation in 2695 CRC cases and 4593 controls from population-based registries in Canada and Australia.  Results:   The HOXB13 pGly84Glu mutation was more common in CRC cases than controls (0.48% vs. 0.17%, P=0.02) indicating a significant association between the HOXB13 variant and CRC risk (OR=2.8; 95%CI: 1.2-6.8). This association was attenuated but remained significant with the inclusion of previously published and publicly available genotype data. Pedigree analysis of cases and controls revealed that 7/21 HOXB13 mutation carriers had a family history of prostate cancer.

All patients were previously evaluated by a multiparametric MRI, interpreted by a single radiologist who attributed a Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) score to each lesion. A conventional 12-core randomized biopsy protocol was performed and 2 additional targeted biopsies were performed on suspicious area(s). The results of randomized and targeted biopsies were compared.  Results:   Among the 30 patients, suspicious area(s) were found on MRI in 20 cases (67%). Median procedure time was 23 minutes.

Materials and methods:   A total of 626 men were treated with curative-intent RT for prostate cancer from 1988 to 2008. Using the National Comprehensive Cancer Network risk category, the patients were considered to have low-risk (30%), intermediate-risk (42%), or high-risk (28%) prostate cancer. The median radiation dose was 74 Gy; 45% received androgen deprivation therapy for a median of 4 months. Late GU and GI Radiation Therapy Oncology Group toxicity was recorded prospectively at each visit after external beam RT. The median follow-up period was 55 months.  Results:   Of the 626 men, 102 (16%) had DM that was controlled by diet (8%), oral medications (52%), or insulin (39%). The patients with DM were more likely to receive intensity-modulated RT and androgen deprivation therapy and to have a shorter follow-up duration (P ≤.05 for all). Univariate analyses demonstrated that greater radiation dose, baseline urinary dysfunction, intensity-modulated RT, and DM were associated with grade 2 or greater GU toxicity, and transurethral resection of the prostate and DM were associated with grade 3 or greater GU toxicity. In addition, androgen deprivation therapy use, age ≥70 years, and anticoagulation were associated with grade 2 or greater GI toxicity, and age ≥70 years and anticoagulation were associated with grade 3 or greater GI toxicity. The multivariate analyses for late toxicity demonstrated a greater risk of grade 2 or greater (relative risk 1.36, P = .10) and grade 3 or greater GU toxicity (relative risk 2.74, P = .04) with DM.

The effect of weight change (SSD increase or decrease) on intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) or volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) dosimetry is not well known, and it is unclear when rescanning or replanning is needed. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of weight change (SSD increase or decrease) on IMRT or VMAT dose delivery in patients with prostate cancer and to determine the SSD change threshold for replanning. Whether IMRT or VMAT provides better dose stability under weight change conditions was also determined. We generated clinical IMRT and VMAT prostate and seminal vesicle treatment plans for varying SSDs for 10 randomly selected patients with prostate cancer.

Therefore present study was designed to determine the performance status of serum PSA in lower cut-off values. This hospital based prospective study was conducted in the Department of Urology of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU) and Comfort Nursing Home Pvt.

The test statistics used to analyze the data were descriptive statistics, sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value, ROC curve. For all analytical tests, the level of significance was set at 0.05 and p < 0.05 was considered significant. In 2.5-4 serum PSA range, 28.26% (13 out of 46) of all malignancy were found, which would be missed if we take cut off value 4. At 2.5 PSA cut-off, Sensitivity 91.3%, Specificity 14.37%, PPV 23.46%, NPV 85.18%, Efficacy 31.55%. At 4 PSA cut-off value, Sensitivity 71.73%, Specificity 46.25%, PPV 27.73%, NPV 85.05%, Efficacy 51.94%.

Furthermore, the influences of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and its duration on (18)F-FCH PET were assessed in this study.  Methods:   This prospective study included 250 prostate cancer patients with PSA relapse who underwent (18)F-FCH PET/CT. At the time of (18)F-FCH PET/CT imaging, the mean PSA level was 46.9 ± 314.7 ng/mL and 55.2% (138/250) of patients were receiving ADT. Overall, ADT was performed on 67.2% (168/250) of patients after initial treatment. Imaging was performed on an integrated PET/CT system. Acquisition started 1 min after intravenous injection of (18)F-FCH (4.07 MBq/kg of body weight) with dynamic PET images in the pelvic region during 8 min (1 min/frame) followed by a static semi-whole-body acquisition. The final diagnosis of positive PET lesions was based on histopathology or a consensus of clinical findings, additional imaging, or follow-up imaging modalities.  Results:   (18)F-FCH PET/CT was able to correctly detect malignant lesions in 74% (185/250) of patients but was negative in 26% (65/250). In 28% of patients, only 1 lesion was detected (69/250); from these, 65.2% (45 patients) had a local recurrence, 18.8% (13 patients) a single lymph node, and 15.9% (11 patients) a solitary bone metastasis. The sensitivity of the (18)F-FCH PET was significantly higher (P = 0.001) in patients with ongoing ADT (85%; confidence interval, 80%-91%) than in patients without ADT (59.5%; confidence interval, 50%-69%). (18)F-FCH PET sensitivity was 77.5%, 80.7%, 85.2%, and 92.8% for the trigger PSA levels of more than 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 4.0 ng/mL, respectively. Scan sensitivity was 33% in patients with a trigger PSA level of less than 0.3 ng/mL and 77% in patients with a trigger PSA level of greater than 0.3 ng/mL, respectively (P = 0.001). Using a binary logistic regression analysis model, we showed trigger PSA and ADT to be the only significant predictors of positive PET findings.  Conclusion:   (18)F-FCH PET/CT proved its potential as a noninvasive 1-stop diagnostic modality enabling us to correctly detect occult disease in 74% of patients and to differentiate localized from systemic disease. In patients with biochemical recurrence, it also guides to an optimal treatment approach after initial treatment. Trigger PSA and ADT are the 2 significant predictors of (18)F-FCH-positive PET lesions.

Estimates of absolute cancer risk after transplantation can inform prevention and screening.  Methods:   The Transplant Cancer Match Study links the US transplantation registry with 14 state/regional cancer registries. The authors used nonparametric competing risk methods to estimate the cumulative incidence of cancer after transplantation for 2 periods (1987-1999 and 2000-2008). For recipients from 2000 to 2008, the 5-year cumulative incidence, stratified by organ, sex, and age at transplantation, was estimated for 6 preventable or screen-detectable cancers. For comparison, the 5-year cumulative incidence was calculated for the same cancers in the general population at representative ages using Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data.  Results:   Among 164,156 recipients, 8520 incident cancers were identified. The absolute cancer risk was slightly higher for recipients during the period from 2000 to 2008 than during the period from 1987 to 1999 (5-year cumulative incidence: 4.4% vs. 4.2%; P = .006); this difference arose from the decreasing risk of competing events (5-year cumulative incidence of death, graft failure, or retransplantation: 26.6% vs. 31.9%; P < .001). From 2000 to 2008, the 5-year cumulative incidence of non-Hodgkin lymphoma was highest at extremes of age, especially in thoracic organ recipients (ages 0-34 years: range, 1.74%-3.28%; aged >50 years; range, 0.36%-2.22%). For recipients aged >50 years, the 5-year cumulative incidence was higher for colorectal cancer (range, 0.33%-1.94%) than for the general population at the recommended screening age (aged 50 years: range, 0.25%-0.33%). For recipients aged >50 years, the 5-year cumulative incidence was high for lung cancer among thoracic organ recipients (range, 1.16%-3.87%) and for kidney cancer among kidney recipients (range, 0.53%-0.84%). The 5-year cumulative incidence for prostate cancer and breast cancer was similar or lower in transplantation recipients than at the recommended ages of screening in the general population.

Methods:   Men who had a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level >4 ng/mL at any time during the study were included. The proportion of men who underwent follow-up evaluation with a repeat PSA, a prostate biopsy, or either test within 9 months was determined, and the authors tested for differences in follow-through according to race using mixed-effects multivariate models with a random effect for accrual site to account for clustering. Models were stratified according to age (<65 years and ≥65 years).  Results:   Among 6294 men who had a PSA elevation during the study period, 70% underwent a repeat PSA or prostate biopsy within 9 months. Non-Hispanic black men aged <65 years had 45% lower odds of undergoing a repeat PSA test or prostate biopsy compared with non-Hispanic white men (odds ratio, 0.55; 95% confidence interval, 0.37-0.82), whereas there was no racial difference in follow-through among older men.

SRC overexpression and overactivation occur in numerous human cancers and are associated with poor clinical outcomes and resistance to therapy. In prostate cancer (PC), the p160 SRCs play critical roles in androgen receptor transcriptional activity, cell proliferation, and resistance to androgen deprivation therapy. We recently demonstrated that the E3 ubiquitin ligase adaptor speckle-type poxvirus and zinc finger (POZ) domain protein (SPOP) interacts directly with SRC-3 and promotes its cullin 3-dependent ubiquitination and proteolysis in breast cancer, thus functioning as a potential tumor suppressor. Interestingly, somatic heterozygous missense mutations in the SPOP substrate-binding cleft recently were identified in up to 15% of human PCs (making SPOP the gene most commonly affected by nonsynonymous point mutations in PC), but their contribution to PC pathophysiology remains unknown. We now report that PC-associated SPOP mutants cannot interact with SRC-3 protein or promote its ubiquitination and degradation. Our data suggest that wild-type SPOP plays a critical tumor suppressor role in PC cells, promoting the turnover of SRC-3 protein and suppressing androgen receptor transcriptional activity. This tumor suppressor effect is abrogated by the PC-associated SPOP mutations.

FOXP2 data were also compared with pre-existing ERG fusion (by fluorescence in situ hybridisation and immunohistochemistry) and cell proliferation (Ki67 labelling index) data.  Results:   There was a moderate to strong FOXP2 protein expression in basal and secretory cells of normal prostatic glands. As compared with normal cells, FOXP2 expression was lost or reduced in 25% of cancers. Strong FOXP2 expression was linked to advanced tumour stage, high Gleason score, presence of lymph node metastases and early tumour recurrence (p<0.0001; each) in ERG fusion-negative, but not in ERG fusion-positive cancers. High FOXP2 expression was linked to high Ki67 labelling index (p<0.0001) in all cancers irrespective of ERG fusion status.  Conclusions:   These data demonstrate that similar high FOXP2 protein levels as in normal prostate epithelium exert a 'paradoxical' oncogenic role in 'non fusion-type' prostate cancer. It may be speculated that interaction of FOXP2 with members of pathways that are specifically activated in 'non fusion-type' cancers may be responsible for this phenomenon.""","""['Laura Stumm', 'Lia Burkhardt', 'Stefan Steurer', 'Ronald Simon', 'Meike Adam', 'Andreas Becker', 'Guido Sauter', 'Sarah Minner', 'Thorsten Schlomm', 'Hüseyin Sirma', 'Uwe Michl']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Clin Pathol""","""['Reduced CD147 expression is linked to ERG fusion-positive prostate cancers but lacks substantial impact on PSA recurrence in patients treated by radical prostatectomy.', 'Recurrent deletion of 3p13 targets multiple tumour suppressor genes and defines a distinct subgroup of aggressive ERG fusion-positive prostate cancers.', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae-like 1 overexpression is frequent in prostate cancer and has markedly different effects in Ets-related gene fusion-positive and fusion-negative cancers.', 'Clinical applications of novel ERG immunohistochemistry in prostate cancer diagnosis and management.', 'The prognostic role of ERG immunopositivity in prostatic acinar adenocarcinoma: a study including 454 cases and review of the literature.', 'Effect of FOXP2 transcription factor on immune infiltration of thyroid cancer and its potential clinical value.', 'A comprehensive in silico analysis of the deleterious nonsynonymous SNPs of human FOXP2 protein.', 'Molecular networks of FOXP family: dual biologic functions, interplay with other molecules and clinical implications in cancer progression.', 'High-level expression of protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor 12 is a strong and independent predictor of poor prognosis in prostate cancer.', 'Nuclear ELAC2 overexpression is associated with increased hazard for relapse after radical prostatectomy.']"""

Being an essential step prior to metastasis, blockage of micrometastasis can have potential applications in cancer therapy and metastasis prevention. Due to poorly known molecular mechanisms leading to micrometastasis, developing therapeutic strategies to target prostate cancer utilizing drugs that block micrometastasis is far from reality. Here, we demonstrate the potential benefits of simvastatin in the inhibition of prostate cancer micrometastasis and reveal the novel molecular mechanisms underlying this process. First, we showed that simvastatin inhibited the ability of human PC3 prostate cancer cells for transendothelial migration in vitro. Second, our data indicated that simvastatin modulates the expression of tumor-derived factors such as angiopoietins and VEGF-A at the mRNA and protein levels by the PC3 cells, thus preventing endothelial-barrier disruption. Third, simvastatin directly activated endothelial cells and enhances endothelial-barrier resistance. Apart from this, our study revealed that simvastatin-mediated effect on PC3 micrometastasis was mediated through inhibition of integrin αv β3 activity and suppression of interaction between prostate cancer cell integrin αv β3 with endothelial ICAM-1.""","""['Belal Al-Husein', 'Anna Goc', 'Payaningal R Somanath']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Cell Physiol""","""['Blocking αvβ3 integrin by a recombinant RGD disintegrin impairs VEGF signaling in endothelial cells.', 'Elevated AKR1C3 expression promotes prostate cancer cell survival and prostate cell-mediated endothelial cell tube formation: implications for prostate cancer progression.', 'Endothelial Akt1 loss promotes prostate cancer metastasis via β-catenin-regulated tight-junction protein turnover.', 'Discrete functions of GSK3α and GSK3β isoforms in prostate tumor growth and micrometastasis.', 'Simvastatin reduces tumor cell adhesion to human peritoneal mesothelial cells by decreased expression of VCAM-1 and β1 integrin.', 'Review and Application of Integrin Alpha v Beta 6 in the Diagnosis and Treatment of Cholangiocarcinoma and Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma.', 'A Novel Overall Survival Prediction Signature Based on Comprehensive Research in Prostate Cancer Bone Metastases.', 'Combined anticancer effects of simvastatin and arsenic trioxide on prostate cancer cell lines via downregulation of the VEGF and OPN isoforms genes.', 'Nodal pathway activation due to Akt1 suppression is a molecular switch for prostate cancer cell epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and metastasis.', 'The unconventional role of Akt1 in the advanced cancers and in diabetes-promoted carcinogenesis.']"""

Immunohistochemistry and cytoimmunofluorescence were subsequently used to determine the localization of Egfl7 in human epithelial tumor tissues and cell lines.

In addition, correlations between Egfl7 expression and clinicopathological features as well as prognosis of HCC and breast cancer were also analyzed on the basis of immunohistochemistry results.   Results:   Egfl7 was differentially expressed in 19 adult human normal tissues and was overexpressed in all 10 human epithelial tumor tissues. The serum Egfl7 level was also significantly elevated in cancer patients. The increased Egfl7 expression in HCC correlated with vein invasion, absence of capsule formation, multiple tumor nodes and poor prognosis. Similarly, upregulation of Egfl7 in breast cancer correlated strongly with TNM stage, lymphatic metastasis, estrogen receptor positivity, Her2 positivity and poor prognosis.

The dose-calculation accuracy of PB and MC was also assessed quantitatively with measurement using ionization chamber and Gafchromic films placed in solid water and heterogeneous phantoms. The dose was calculated using PB convolution and MC algorithms in the iPlan treatment planning system from BrainLAB. The dose calculation was performed on the patient's computed tomography images with lesions in various treatment sites including 5 lungs, 5 prostates, 4 brains, 2 head and necks, and 2 paraspinal tissues. A combination of conventional, conformal, and intensity-modulated radiation therapy plans was used in dose calculation. The leaf sequence from intensity-modulated radiation therapy plans or beam shapes from conformal plans and monitor units and other planning parameters calculated by the PB were identical for calculating dose with MC. Heterogeneity correction was considered in both PB and MC dose calculations. Dose-volume parameters such as V95 (volume covered by 95% of prescription dose), dose distributions, and gamma analysis were used to evaluate the calculated dose by PB and MC. The measured doses by ionization chamber and EBT GAFCHROMIC film in solid water and heterogeneous phantoms were used to quantitatively asses the accuracy of dose calculated by PB and MC. The dose-volume histograms and dose distributions calculated by PB and MC in the brain, prostate, paraspinal, and head and neck were in good agreement with one another (within 5%) and provided acceptable planning target volume coverage. However, dose distributions of the patients with lung cancer had large discrepancies. For a plan optimized with PB, the dose coverage was shown as clinically acceptable, whereas in reality, the MC showed a systematic lack of dose coverage. The dose calculated by PB for lung tumors was overestimated by up to 40%. An interesting feature that was observed is that despite large discrepancies in dose-volume histogram coverage of the planning target volume between PB and MC, the point doses at the isocenter (center of the lesions) calculated by both algorithms were within 7% even for lung cases. The dose distributions measured with EBT GAFCHROMIC films in heterogeneous phantoms showed large discrepancies of nearly 15% lower than PB at interfaces between heterogeneous media, where these lower doses measured by the film were in agreement with those by MC. The doses (V95) calculated by MC and PB agreed within 5% for treatment sites with small tissue heterogeneities such as the prostate, brain, head and neck, and paraspinal tumors. Considerable discrepancies, up to 40%, were observed in the dose-volume coverage between MC and PB in lung tumors, which may affect clinical outcomes. The discrepancies between MC and PB increased for 15MV compared with 6MV indicating the importance of implementation of accurate clinical treatment planning such as MC. The comparison of point doses is not representative of the discrepancies in dose coverage and might be misleading in evaluating the accuracy of dose calculation between PB and MC. Thus, the clinical quality assurance procedures required to verify the accuracy of dose calculation using PB and MC need to consider measurements of 2- and 3-dimensional dose distributions rather than a single point measurement using heterogeneous phantoms instead of homogenous water-equivalent phantoms.""","""['Imad Ali', 'Salahuddin Ahmad']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Med Dosim""","""['Dosimetric verification and clinical evaluation of a new commercially available Monte Carlo-based dose algorithm for application in stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) treatment planning.', 'Assessment of Monte Carlo algorithm for compliance with RTOG 0915 dosimetric criteria in peripheral lung cancer patients treated with stereotactic body radiotherapy.', 'Verification measurements and clinical evaluation of the iPlan RT Monte Carlo dose algorithm for 6 MV photon energy.', 'High-density dental implants and radiotherapy planning: evaluation of effects on dose distribution using pencil beam convolution algorithm and Monte Carlo method.', 'Report of the AAPM Task Group No. 105: Issues associated with clinical implementation of Monte Carlo-based photon and electron external beam treatment planning.', 'Investigation of tube voltage dependence on CT number and its effect on dose calculation algorithms using thorax phantom in Monaco treatment planning system for external beam radiation therapy.', 'Dosimetric comparison of pencil beam and Monte Carlo algorithms in conformal lung radiotherapy.', 'Dosimetric verification by using the ArcCHECK system and 3DVH software for various target sizes.']"""

NKX3.1 mediates the cellular response to DNA damage by interacting with ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) and by activation of topoisomerase I. In the present study we characterized the interaction between NKX3.1 and topoisomerase I. The NKX3.1 homeodomain binds to a region of topoisomerase I spanning the junction between the core and linker domains. Loss of the topoisomerase I N-terminal domain, a region for frequent protein interactions, did not affect binding to NKX3.1 as was shown by the activation of Topo70 (N-terminal truncated topoisomerase I) in vitro. In contrast, NKX3.1 interacts with the enzyme reconstituted from peptide fragments of the core and linker active site domains, but inhibits the DNA-resolving activity of the reconstituted enzyme in vitro. The effect of NKX3.1 on both Topo70 and the reconstituted enzyme was seen in the presence and absence of camptothecin. Neither NKX3.1 nor CPT (camptothecin) had an effect on the interaction of the other with topoisomerase I. Therefore the interactions of NKX3.1 and CPT with the linker domain of topoisomerase I are mutually exclusive.

This decision was based on Phase III results, which demonstrate that blocking this immune checkpoint provides a survival advantage in patients with advanced disease. As a single agent, ipilimumab is also being clinically evaluated in advanced (metastatic, castrate-resistant) prostate cancer and two randomized, placebo-controlled Phase III studies have recently completed accrual.  Methods:   We used a well-described genetically engineered mouse (GEM), autochronous prostate cancer model (Pro-TRAMP) to explore the relative sequencing and dosing of anti-CTLA-4 antibody when combined with a cell-based, GM-CSF-secreting vaccine (GVAX).  Results:   Our results show that combined treatment results in a dramatic increase in effector CD8 T cells in the prostate gland, and enhanced tumor-antigen directed lytic function. These effects are maximized when CTLA-4 blockade is applied after, but not before, vaccination. Additional experiments, using models of metastatic disease, show that incorporation of low-dose cyclophosphamide into this combined treatment regimen results in an additional pre-clinical benefit.

Prostate interventional therapy, such as cryotherapy and brachytherapy, is an effective treatment for prostate cancer. Its success relies on the correct needle implant position. This paper proposes a robust and efficient needle segmentation method, which acts as an aid to localize the needle in three-dimensional (3D) transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) guided prostate therapy.  Methods:   The procedure of locating the needle in a 3D TRUS image is a three-step process. First, the original 3D ultrasound image containing a needle is cropped; the cropped image is then converted to a binary format based on its histogram. Second, a 3D Hough transform based needle segmentation method is applied to the 3D binary image in order to locate the needle axis. The position of the needle endpoint is finally determined by an optimal threshold based analysis of the intensity probability distribution. The overall efficiency is improved through implementing a coarse-fine searching strategy. The proposed method was validated in tissue-mimicking agar phantoms, chicken breast phantoms, and 3D TRUS patient images from prostate brachytherapy and cryotherapy procedures by comparison to the manual segmentation. The robustness of the proposed approach was tested by means of varying parameters such as needle insertion angle, needle insertion length, binarization threshold level, and cropping size.  Results:   The validation results indicate that the proposed Hough transform based method is accurate and robust, with an achieved endpoint localization accuracy of 0.5 mm for agar phantom images, 0.7 mm for chicken breast phantom images, and 1 mm for in vivo patient cryotherapy and brachytherapy images. The mean execution time of needle segmentation algorithm was 2 s for a 3D TRUS image with size of 264 × 376 × 630 voxels.  Conclusions:   The proposed needle segmentation algorithm is accurate, robust, and suitable for 3D TRUS guided prostate transperineal therapy.""","""['Wu Qiu', 'Ming Yuchi', 'Mingyue Ding', 'David Tessier', 'Aaron Fenster']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Phase grouping-based needle segmentation in 3-D trans-rectal ultrasound-guided prostate trans-perineal therapy.', 'Needle and seed segmentation in intra-operative 3D ultrasound-guided prostate brachytherapy.', 'Oblique needle segmentation and tracking for 3D TRUS guided prostate brachytherapy.', 'Clinical evaluation of an MRI-to-ultrasound deformable image registration algorithm for prostate brachytherapy.', 'The role of transrectal ultrasound on prostatic cryotherapy and brachytherapy.', 'Automatic needle detection using improved random sample consensus in CT image-guided lung interstitial brachytherapy.', 'Enhancement of needle visualization and localization in ultrasound.', 'Multi-Needle Detection in 3D Ultrasound Images Using Unsupervised Order-Graph Regularized Sparse Dictionary Learning.', 'Accurate model-based segmentation of gynecologic brachytherapy catheter collections in MRI-images.', 'Intraoperative detection and localization of cylindrical implants in cone-beam CT image data.']"""

Various image registration algorithms have been developed for clinical application. However, validation of these algorithms in the current clinical setting remains subjective, relying on visual assessment and lacking a comparison to the ground-truth deformation. In this study, the authors propose a framework to quantitatively validate various image registration solutions by using patient-based synthetic quality assurance (QA) phantoms, which can be applied on a site-by-site basis.  Methods:   The computer-simulated deformation was first generated with virtual deformation QA software and further benchmarked using a physical pelvic phantom that was modeled after real patient CT images. After the validity of the virtual deformation was confirmed, a set of synthetic deformable images was produced to simulate various anatomical movements during radiotherapy based on real patient CT images. Three patients with head-and-neck, prostate, and spine cancer were included. The transformations included bladder filling, soft tissue deformation, mandible, and vertebral body movement, etc., which provided various ground-truth images to validate deformable registration. Several clinically available deformable registration algorithms were tested on these images with multiple registration setups, such as global or regional and single-pass or multipass optimization. The generated deformation fields and the ground-truth deformation are compared using voxel-by-voxel based analysis as well as regional based analysis.  Results:   Performance of registration algorithms varies with clinical sites. The voxel-by-voxel analysis showed the intensity-based free-form deformation by MIM generated the greatest accuracy for low-contrast small regions that underwent significant deformation, such as bladder expansion for prostate. However, for large field deformations with strong contrast, this approach may increase errors, which is especially evident in the cranial spinal irradiation (CSI) case. Both single-pass and multipass B-spline registrations performed well for the head-and-neck patient and CSI patients.  Conclusions:   QA for deformable image registration is essential to verify the cumulated dose for accurate adaptive radiotherapy. In this study, the authors develop a workflow that can validate image registration techniques for several different clinical sites and for various types of deformations using patient-based simulated deformations. This work could provide a reference for clinicians and radiation physicists on how to choose appropriate image registration algorithms for different situations.""","""['Ke Nie', 'Cynthia Chuang', 'Neil Kirby', 'Steve Braunstein', 'Jean Pouliot']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['A framework for deformable image registration validation in radiotherapy clinical applications.', 'Object-constrained meshless deformable algorithm for high speed 3D nonrigid registration between CT and CBCT.', 'Analysis of deformable image registration accuracy using computational modeling.', '""Patient-specific validation of deformable image registration in radiation therapy: Overview and caveats"".', 'Clinical evaluation of an MRI-to-ultrasound deformable image registration algorithm for prostate brachytherapy.', 'Development of a physical geometric phantom for deformable image registration credentialing of radiotherapy centers for a clinical trial.', 'Validation of accuracy deformable image registration contour propagation using a benchmark virtual HN phantom dataset.', 'Quantifying the accuracy of deformable image registration for cone-beam computed tomography with a physical phantom.', 'A multiparametric method to assess the MIM deformable image registration algorithm.', 'Validation of a deformable MRI to CT registration algorithm employing same day planning MRI for surrogate analysis.']"""

For effective application of these methods the exact positioning of the patient and the localization of the irradiated organ and surrounding structures is crucial. Especially with respect to the treatment of the prostate, ultrasound (US) allows for differentiation between soft tissue and was therefore applied by various repositioning systems, such as BAT or Clarity. The authors built a new system which uses 3D US at both sites, the CT room and the intervention room and applied a 3D/3D US/US registration for automatic repositioning.  Methods:   In a first step the authors applied image preprocessing methods to prepare the US images for an optimal registration process. For the 3D/3D registration procedure five different metrics were evaluated. To find the image metric which fits best for a particular patient three 3D US images were taken at the CT site and registered to each other. From these results an US registration error was calculated. The most successful image metric was then applied for the US/US registration process. The success of the whole repositioning method was assessed by taking the results of an ExacTrac system as golden standard.  Results:   The US/US registration error was found to be 2.99 ± 1.54 mm with respect to the mutual information metric by Mattes (eleven patients) which revealed to be the most suitable of the assessed metrics. For complete repositioning chain the error amounted to 4.15 ± 1.20 mm (ten patients).

Incorrect seed placement leads to both short and long term complications, including urethral and rectal toxicity. The authors present BrachyView, a novel concept of a fast intraoperative treatment planning system, to provide real-time seed placement information based on in-body gamma camera data. BrachyView combines the high spatial resolution of a pixellated silicon detector (Medipix2) with the volumetric information acquired by a transrectal ultrasound (TRUS). The two systems will be embedded in the same probe so as to provide anatomically correct seed positions for intraoperative planning and postimplant dosimetry. Dosimetric calculations are based on the TG-43 method using the real position of the seeds. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the feasibility of BrachyView using the Medipix2 pixel detector and a pinhole collimator to reconstruct the real-time 3D position of low dose-rate brachytherapy seeds in a phantom.  Methods:   BrachyView incorporates three Medipix2 detectors coupled to a multipinhole collimator. Three-dimensionally triangulated seed positions from multiple planar images are used to determine the seed placement in a PMMA prostate phantom in real time. MATLAB codes were used to test the reconstruction method and to optimize the device geometry.  Results:   The results presented in this paper show a 3D position reconstruction accuracy of the seed in the range of 0.5-3 mm for a 10-60 mm seed-to-detector distance interval (Z direction), respectively. The BrachyView system also demonstrates a spatial resolution of 0.25 mm in the XY plane for sources at 10 mm distance from Medipix2 detector plane, comparable to the theoretical value calculated for an equivalent gamma camera arrangement. The authors successfully demonstrated the capability of BrachyView for real-time imaging (using a 3 s data acquisition time) of different brachytherapy seed configurations (with an activity of 0.05 U) throughout a 60 × 60 × 60 mm(3) Perspex prostate phantom.

This study evaluates four different imaging modalities 3D ultrasound (US), kV planar images, cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT), and implanted electromagnetic transponders (Calypso/Varian) to assess inter- and intrafraction localization errors during intensity-modulated radiation therapy based treatment of prostate cancer.  Methods:   Twenty-seven prostate cancer patients were enrolled in a prospective IRB-approved study and treated to a total dose of 75.6 Gy (1.8 Gy/fraction). Overall, 1100 fractions were evaluated. For each fraction, treatment targets were localized using US, kV planar images, and CBCT in a sequence defined to determine setup offsets relative to the patient skin tattoos, intermodality differences, and residual errors for each patient and patient cohort. Planning margins, following van Herk's formalism, were estimated based on error distributions. Calypso-based localization was not available for the first eight patients, therefore centroid positions of implanted gold-seed markers imaged prior to and immediately following treatment were used as a motion surrogate during treatment. For the remaining 19 patients, Calypso transponders were used to assess prostate intrafraction motion.  Results:   The means (μ), and standard deviations (SD) of the systematic (Σ) and random errors (σ) of interfraction prostate shifts (relative to initial skin tattoo positioning), as evaluated using CBCT, kV, and US, averaged over all patients and fractions, were: [μ CBCT = (-1.2, 0.2, 1.1) mm, Σ CBCT = (3.0, 1.4, 2.4) mm, σ CBCT = (3.2, 2.2, 2.5) mm], [μkV = (-2.9, -0.4, 0.5) mm, Σ kV = (3.4, 3.1, 2.6) mm, σ kV = (2.9, 2.0, 2.4) mm], and [μ US = (-3.6, -1.4, 0.0) mm, Σ US = (3.3, 3.5, 2.8) mm, σ US = (4.1, 3.8, 3.6) mm], in the anterior-posterior (A/P), superior-inferior (S/I), and the left-right (L/R) directions, respectively. In the treatment protocol, adjustment of couch was guided by US images. Residual setup errors as assessed by kV images were found to be: μ residual = (-0.4, 0.2, 0.2) mm, Σ residual = (1.0, 1.0,0.7) mm, and σ residual = (2.5, 2.3, 1.8) mm. Intrafraction prostate motion, evaluated using electromagnetic transponders, was: μ intrafxn = (0.0, 0.0, 0.0) mm, Σ intrafxn = (1.3, 1.5, 0.6) mm, and σ intrafxn = (2.6, 2.4, 1.4) mm. Shifts between pre- and post-treatment kV images were: μ kV(post-pre) = (-0.3, 0.8, -0.2), Σ kV(post-pre) = (2.4, 2.7, 2.1) mm, and σ kV(post-pre) = (2.7, 3.2, 3.1) mm. Relative to skin tattoos, planning margins for setup error were within 10-11 mm for all image-based modalities. The use of image guidance was shown to reduce these margins to less than 5 mm. Margins to compensate for both residual setup (interfraction) errors as well as intrafraction motion were 6.6, 6.8, and 3.9 mm in the A/P, S/I, and L/R directions, respectively.  Conclusions:   Analysis of interfraction setup errors, performed with US, CBCT, planar kV images, and electromagnetic transponders, from a large dataset revealed intermodality shifts were comparable (within 3-4 mm). Interfraction planning margins, relative to setup based on skin marks, were generally within the 10 mm prostate-to-planning target volume margin used in our clinic. With image guidance, interfraction residual planning margins were reduced to approximately less than 4 mm.

Here we investigated the role of the transcription factor Gli1 in ovarian cancer. To this end, the expression profile of Gli1 was examined in normal ovaries, ovarian tumors, and ovarian cancer cell lines, and the in vitro effects of a specific Hh-pathway blocker, KAAD-cyclopamine, or a specific Gli1 inhibitor (GANT58) on cell proliferation and on Hh target gene expression were also assessed. Results obtained showed that epithelial cells in ovarian cancer tissue express significantly higher levels of nuclear Gli1 than in normal ovarian tissue, where the protein was almost undetectable. In addition, multivariate analysis showed that nuclear Gli1 was independently associated to poor survival in advanced serous ovarian cancer patients (HR = 2.2, 95%CI 1.0-5.1, p = 0.04). In vitro experiments demonstrated Gli1 expression in the three ovarian carcinoma cell lines tested, A2780, SKOV-3 and OVCAR-3. Remarkably, although KAAD-cyclopamine led to decreased cell proliferation, this treatment did not inhibit hedgehog target gene expression in any of the three ovarian cancer cell lines, suggesting that the inhibition of cell proliferation was a nonspecific or toxic effect. In line with these data, no differences on cell proliferation were observed when cell lines were treated with GANT58. Overall, our clinical data support the role of Gli1 as a prognostic marker in advanced serous ovarian cancer and as a possible therapeutic target in this disease. However, our in vitro findings draw attention to the need for selection of appropriate experimental models that accurately represent human tumor for testing future therapies involving Hh pathway inhibitors.""","""['Alessandra Ciucci', 'Ilaria De Stefano', 'Valerio Gaetano Vellone', 'Lucia Lisi', 'Carolina Bottoni', 'Giovanni Scambia', 'Gian Franco Zannoni', 'Daniela Gallo']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Inhibition of Hedgehog signaling antagonizes serous ovarian cancer growth in a primary xenograft model.', 'LKB1 inhibits breast cancer partially through repressing the Hedgehog signaling pathway.', 'Hedgehog signaling pathway regulates the growth of ovarian cancer spheroid forming cells.', 'Hedgehog Signaling and Truncated GLI1 in Cancer.', 'Reliable in vitro studies require appropriate ovarian cancer cell lines.', 'Traditional Chinese medicine for colorectal cancer treatment: potential targets and mechanisms of action.', 'Pilomatrix-like High-Grade Endometrioid Carcinoma of the Ovary: Case Report, Literature Review, and Differential Diagnosis.', 'Prognostic Value of Chemotherapy Response Score (CRS) Assessed on the Adnexa in Ovarian High-Grade Serous Carcinoma: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'Prognostic significance of CTNNB1 mutation in early stage endometrial carcinoma: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'The Role of Smoothened-Dependent and -Independent Hedgehog Signaling Pathway in Tumorigenesis.']"""

We have envisioned that potency of silybin could be further enhanced through suitable modification/s in its chemical structure. Accordingly, here, we synthesized and characterized a series of silybin derivatives namely 2,3-dehydrosilybin (DHS), 7-O-methylsilybin (7OM), 7-O-galloylsilybin (7OG), 7,23-disulphatesilybin (DSS), 7-O-palmitoylsilybin (7OP), and 23-O-palmitoylsilybin (23OP); and compared their anti-cancer efficacy using human bladder cancer HTB9, colon cancer HCT116 and prostate carcinoma PC3 cells. In all the 3 cell lines, DHS, 7OM and 7OG demonstrated better growth inhibitory effects and compared to silybin, while other silybin derivatives showed lesser or no efficacy. Next, we prepared the optical isomers (A and B) of silybin, DHS, 7OM and 7OG, and compared their anti-cancer efficacy. Isomers of these three silybin derivatives also showed better efficacy compared with respective silybin isomers, but in each, there was no clear cut silybin A versus B isomer activity preference. Further studies in HTB cells found that DHS, 7OM and 7OG exert better apoptotic activity than silibinin. Clonogenic assays in HTB9 cells further confirmed that both the racemic mixtures as well as pure optical isomers of DHS, 7OM and 7OG were more effective than silybin. Overall, these results clearly suggest that the anti-cancer efficacy of silybin could be significantly enhanced through structural modifications, and identify strong anti-cancer efficacy of silybin derivatives, namely DHS, 7OM, and 7OG, signifying that their efficacy and toxicity should be evaluated in relevant pre-clinical cancer models in rodents.""","""['Chapla Agarwal', 'Ritambhara Wadhwa', 'Gagan Deep', 'David Biedermann', 'Radek Gažák', 'Vladimír Křen', 'Rajesh Agarwal']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Identifying the differential effects of silymarin constituents on cell growth and cell cycle regulatory molecules in human prostate cancer cells.', 'Enhanced bioactivity of silybin B methylation products.', 'Significantly greater antioxidant anticancer activities of 2,3-dehydrosilybin than silybin.', 'Chemistry of silybin.', 'Silybin and silymarin--new and emerging applications in medicine.', 'Silybin Showed Higher Cytotoxic, Antiproliferative, and Anti-Inflammatory Activities in the CaCo Cancer Cell Line while Retaining Viability and Proliferation in Normal Intestinal IPEC-1 Cells.', '3-O-Carbamoyl-5,7,20-O-trimethylsilybins: Synthesis and Preliminary Antiproliferative Evaluation.', 'Chirality Matters: Biological Activity of Optically Pure Silybin and Its Congeners.', 'Dehydroflavonolignans from Silymarin Potentiate Transition Metal Toxicity In Vitro but Are Protective for Isolated Erythrocytes Ex Vivo.', 'Important Flavonoids and Their Role as a Therapeutic Agent.']"""

One of the consequences of ERG accumulation is modulation of the cell's gene expression profile. Tudor domain-containing protein 1 gene (TDRD1) was reported to be differentially expressed between TMPRSS2:ERG-negative and TMPRSS2:ERG-positive prostate cancer. The aim of our study was to provide a mechanistic explanation for the transcriptional activation of TDRD1 in ERG rearrangement-positive prostate tumors.  Methodology/principal findings:   Gene expression measurements by real-time quantitative PCR revealed a remarkable co-expression of TDRD1 and ERG (r(2) = 0.77) but not ETV1 (r(2)<0.01) in human prostate cancer in vivo. DNA methylation analysis by MeDIP-Seq and bisulfite sequencing showed that TDRD1 expression is inversely correlated with DNA methylation at the TDRD1 promoter in vitro and in vivo (ρ = -0.57). Accordingly, demethylation of the TDRD1 promoter in TMPRSS2:ERG-negative prostate cancer cells by DNA methyltransferase inhibitors resulted in TDRD1 induction. By manipulation of ERG dosage through gene silencing and forced expression we show that ERG governs loss of DNA methylation at the TDRD1 promoter-associated CpG island, leading to TDRD1 overexpression.  Conclusions/significance:   We demonstrate that ERG is capable of disrupting a tissue-specific DNA methylation pattern at the TDRD1 promoter. As a result, TDRD1 becomes transcriptionally activated in TMPRSS2:ERG-positive prostate cancer. Given the prevalence of ERG fusions, TDRD1 overexpression is a common alteration in human prostate cancer which may be exploited for diagnostic or therapeutic procedures.""","""['Lukasz A Kacprzyk', 'Mark Laible', 'Tatjana Andrasiuk', 'Jan C Brase', 'Stefan T Börno', 'Maria Fälth', 'Ruprecht Kuner', 'Hans Lehrach', 'Michal R Schweiger', 'Holger Sültmann']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Identification of TDRD1 as a direct target gene of ERG in primary prostate cancer.', 'The Germ Cell Gene TDRD1 as an ERG Target Gene and a Novel Prostate Cancer Biomarker.', 'Molecular subtyping of primary prostate cancer reveals specific and shared target genes of different ETS rearrangements.', 'The progress of TMPRSS2-ETS gene fusions and their mechanism in prostate cancer.', 'ERG protein expression as a biomarker of prostate cancer.', 'The cancer testis antigen TDRD1 regulates prostate cancer proliferation by associating with the snRNP biogenesis machinery.', 'The cancer testis antigen TDRD1 regulates prostate cancer proliferation by associating with snRNP biogenesis machinery.', 'Transcriptional network involving ERG and AR orchestrates Distal-less\xa0homeobox-1 mediated prostate cancer progression.', 'Re-Evaluate Fusion Genes in Prostate Cancer.', 'A Comprehensive Molecular and Clinical Analysis of the piRNA Pathway Genes in Ovarian Cancer.']"""

Current xenografts rely on tumor cell inoculation by intravesical instillation or direct injection into the bladder wall. Instillation is limited by the lack of cell lines that are tumorigenic when delivered in this manner. The invasive model inflicts morbidity on the mice by the need for laparotomy and mobilization of the bladder. Furthermore this procedure is complex and time-consuming. Three bladder cancer cell lines (UM-UC1, UM-UC3, UM-UC13) were inoculated into 50 athymic nude mice by percutaneous injection under ultrasound guidance. PBS was first injected between the muscle wall and the mucosa to separate these layers, and tumor cells were subsequently injected into this space. Bioluminescence and ultrasound were used to monitor tumor growth. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound was used to study changes in tumor perfusion after systemic gemcitabine/cisplatin treatment. To demonstrate proof of principle that therapeutic agents can be injected into established xenografts under ultrasound guidance, oncolytic virus (VSV) was injected into UM-UC3 tumors. Xenograft tissue was harvested for immunohistochemistry after 23-37 days. Percutaneous injection of tumor cells into the bladder wall was performed efficiently (mean time: 5.7 min) and without complications in all 50 animals. Ultrasound and bioluminescence confirmed presence of tumor in the anterior bladder wall in all animals 3 days later. The average tumor volumes increased steadily over the study period. UM-UC13 tumors showed a marked decrease in volume and perfusion after chemotherapy. Immunohistochemical staining for VSV-G demonstrated virus uptake in all UM-UC3 tumors after intratumoral injection.

In breast cancer, the strongest associations included either SNPs in or gene burden scores for genes LDLRAD1, SLC19A1, FGFBP3, CASP5, MMAB, SLC16A6, and INS-IGF2.

In addition to breast and prostate cancer, other cancer-related traits were examined (body mass index, PSA level, and alcohol drinking) with a number of known and potentially novel associations described. In general, these findings do not support there being many protein coding variants of moderate to high risk for breast and prostate cancer with odds ratios over a range that is probably required for protein coding variation to play a truly outstanding role in risk heritability.

The expression of miR-574-3p was significantly lower in PCa cell lines and clinical PCa tissues compared with normal prostate cells (RWPE-1) and adjacent normal tissues. Low expression level of miR-574-3p was correlated with advanced tumor stage and higher Gleason score in PCa specimens. Re-expression of miR-574-3p in PCa cells significantly inhibited cell proliferation, migration and invasion in vitro and in vivo. miR-574-3p restoration induced apoptosis through reducing Bcl-xL and activating caspase-9 and caspase-3. Using GeneCodis software analysis, several pathways affected by miR-574-3p were identified, such as 'Pathways in cancer', 'Jak-STAT signaling pathway', and 'Wnt signaling pathway'.

Quantitative real-time PCR and Western analysis showed that the mRNA and protein expression levels of the three target genes in PCa cells were markedly down-regulated with miR-574-3p. Loss-of-function studies demonstrated that the three target genes significantly affect cell proliferation, migration and invasion in PCa cell lines.

We have shown previously that NF-kB signaling is highly activated in these T/E fusion expressing cells via phosphorylation of NF-kB p65 Ser536 (p536). We therefore hypothesize that targeting NF-kB signaling may be an efficacious approach for the subgroup of PCas that carry T/E fusions. Celastrol is a well known NF-kB inhibitor, and thus may inhibit T/E fusion expressing PCa cell growth. We therefore evaluated Celastrol's effects in vitro and in vivo in VCaP cells, which express the T/E fusion gene. VCaP cells were treated with different concentrations of Celastrol and growth inhibition and target expression were evaluated. To test its ability to inhibit growth in vivo, 0.5 mg/kg Celastrol was used to treat mice bearing subcutaneous VCaP xenograft tumors. Our results show Celastrol can significantly inhibit the growth of T/E fusion expressing PCa cells both in vitro and in vivo through targeting three critical signaling pathways: AR, ERG and NF-kB in these cells. When mice received 0.5 mg/kg Celastrol for 4 times/week, significant growth inhibition was seen with no obvious toxicity or significant weight loss. Therefore, Celastrol is a promising candidate drug for T/E fusion expressing PCa. Our findings provide a novel strategy for the targeted therapy which may benefit the more than half of PCa patients who have T/E fusion expressing PCas.""","""['Longjiang Shao', 'Zhansong Zhou', 'Yi Cai', 'Patricia Castro', 'Olga Dakhov', 'Ping Shi', 'Yaoxia Bai', 'Huixiang Ji', 'Wenhao Shen', 'Jianghua Wang']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Function of phosphorylation of NF-kB p65 ser536 in prostate cancer oncogenesis.', 'ERG induces androgen receptor-mediated regulation of SOX9 in prostate cancer.', 'TMPRSS2-ERG fusions confer efficacy of enzalutamide in an in vivo bone tumor growth model.', 'Celastrol as an emerging anticancer agent: Current status, challenges and therapeutic strategies.', 'Current mouse and cell models in prostate cancer research.', 'SHP2 inhibition improves celastrol-induced growth suppression of colorectal cancer.', 'Quercetin and Its Nano-Scale Delivery Systems in Prostate Cancer Therapy: Paving the Way for Cancer Elimination and Reversing Chemoresistance.', 'Phytopharmaceuticals mediated Furin and TMPRSS2 receptor blocking: can it be a potential therapeutic option for Covid-19?', 'Natural Compounds in Prostate Cancer Prevention and Treatment: Mechanisms of Action and Molecular Targets.', 'Celastrol attenuates ventilator induced lung injury in mouse through inhibition of MAPK pathway.']"""

A recent phase II study of cabozantinib (100 mg daily) showed improved bone scans in subjects with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), but adverse events (AE) caused frequent dose reductions. This study was designed to determine the efficacy and tolerability of cabozantinib at lower starting doses.  Experimental design:   An adaptive design was used to determine the lowest active daily dose among 60, 40, and 20 mg. The primary endpoint was week 6 bone scan response, defined as ≥30% decrease in bone scan lesion area. The secondary endpoint was change in circulating tumor cells (CTC).  Results:   Among 11 evaluable subjects enrolled at 40 mg, there were 9 partial responses (PR), 1 complete response, and 1 stable disease (SD). Of 10 subjects subsequently enrolled at 20 mg, there were 1 PR, 5 SDs, and 4 with progressive disease. Among 13 subjects enrolled on the 40 mg expansion cohort, there were 6 PRs and 7 SDs. No subjects required dose reduction or treatment interruption at 6 or 12 weeks; 3 subjects at dose level 0 discontinued due to AEs by 12 weeks. At 40 mg, median treatment duration was 27 weeks. 58% of subjects with ≥5 CTCs/7.5 mL at baseline converted to <5.  Conclusions:   Cabozantinib 40 mg daily was associated with a high rate of bone scan response. Cabozantinib 40 mg daily was associated with better tolerability than previously reported for cabozantinib 100 mg daily.

There are three classes of PI3K, named class I-III, on the bases of the protein domain constituting and determining their specificity. The first one is the best characterized and includes a number of key elements for the integration of different cellular signals. Regulatory p85 subunit shares with the catalytic p110 subunit, a N-terminal SH3 domain showing homology with the protein domain Rho-GTP-ase. After cell stimulation, all class I PI3Ks are recruited to the inner face of the plasma membrane, where they generate phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate by direct phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate. All pathways trigger the control of different phenomena such as cell growth, proliferation, apoptosis, adhesion and migration through various downstream effectors. We have previously provided direct evidences that a Serine in position 83, adjacent to the N-terminal SH3 domain of regulatory subunit of PI3K, is a substrate of PKA. The aim of this work is to confirm the role of p85αPI3KSer83 in regulating cell proliferation, migration and invasion in prostate cancer cells LNCaP. To this purpose cells were transfected with mutant forms of p85, where Serine was replaced by Alanine, where phosphorylation is prevented, or Aspartic Acid, to mimic the phosphorylated residue.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the accuracy of self-reported tobacco use in newly diagnosed cancer patients.  Methods:   Tobacco use questionnaires and blood samples were collected from 233 newly diagnosed cancer patients (77 lung, 77 breast, and 79 prostate cancer). Blood was analyzed for cotinine levels using a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Patients with cotinine measurements exceeding 10 ng/mL were categorized as current smokers. Smoking status based upon cotinine levels was contrasted with self-report in current smokers, recent quitters (1 or less year since quit), non-recent quitters (>1 year since quit), and never smokers. Multivariate analyses were used to identify potential predictors of discordance between self-reported and biochemically confirmed smoking.  Results:   Cotinine confirmed 100 % accuracy in self-reporting of current and never smokers. Discordance in cotinine and smoking status was observed in 26 patients (15.0 %) reporting former tobacco use. Discordance in self-reported smoking was 12 times higher in recent (35.4 %) as compared with non-recent quitters (2.8 %). Combining disease site, pack-year history, and employment status predicted misrepresentation of tobacco use in 82.4 % of recent quitters.  Conclusions:   Self-reported tobacco use may not accurately assess smoking status in newly diagnosed cancer patients. Patients who claim to have recently stopped smoking within the year prior to a cancer diagnosis and lung cancer patients may have a higher propensity to misrepresent tobacco use and may benefit from biochemical confirmation.""","""['Nelson A Morales', 'Michelle A Romano', 'K Michael Cummings', 'James R Marshall', 'Andrew J Hyland', 'Alan Hutson', 'Graham W Warren']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Cancer Causes Control""","""['Accuracy of self-reported tobacco use status among hematopoietic SCT patients.', 'Short-term benefit of smoking cessation in patients with coronary heart disease: estimates based on self-reported smoking data and serum cotinine measurements.', 'Environmental tobacco smoke and risk of respiratory cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in former smokers and never smokers in the EPIC prospective study.', 'Validation of self-reported smokeless tobacco use by measurement of serum cotinine concentration among US adults.', 'Reporting of tobacco use and tobacco-related analyses in cancer cooperative group clinical trials: a systematic scoping review.', 'Verifying the accuracy of self-reported smoking behavior in female volunteer soldiers.', 'Association of Pack-Years of Cigarette Smoking With Survival and Tumor Progression Among Patients Treated With Chemoradiation for Head and Neck Cancer.', 'The Role of Electronic Patient-Reported Outcome Measures in Assessing Smoking Status and Cessation for Patients with Lung Cancer.', 'AhRR methylation contributes to disease progression in urothelial bladder cancer.', ""Associations between cancer diagnosis and patients' responses to an inpatient tobacco treatment intervention.""]"""

We used information on cancer patients diagnosed in 1978-2002 with vital status information available up to 31 December 2003, from 76 European cancer registries.  Results:   About 11.6 millions of Europeans with a history of one of the major considered cancers were alive on 1 January 2003. For breast and prostate cancers, about 1 out of 73 women and 1 out of 160 men were living with a previous diagnosis of breast and prostate cancers, respectively. The demographic variations alone will increase the number of prevalent cases to nearly 13 millions in 2010.  Conclusions:   Several factors (early detection, population aging and better treatment) contribute to increase cancer prevalence and push for the need of a continuous monitoring of prevalence indicators to properly plan needs, resource allocation to cancer and for improving health care programs for cancer survivors.

In urological cancers, expression of EP2R and EP4R can be significant predictors of survival for renal cell carcinoma (RCC). On the other hand, EP1R, EP2R, and EP4R are known to be associated with carcinogenesis and malignant aggressiveness in prostate cancer. In addition, EP4R has been associated with tumor progression and prognosis in urothelial cancer of the upper urinary tract. There is a general agreement that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can reduce the risk of several malignancies including colorectal cancer. However, NSAIDs often cause gastrointestinal injury and nephropathy. On the other hand, cyclooxygenase (COX)-2-selective inhibitors can reduce the progression of cancer via the suppression of cell proliferation angiogenesis without decreasing adverse reactions. However, COX-2-selective inhibitors might increase the risk of cardiovascular disease, including myocardial infarction. More selective and detailed control of COX-2-mediated signals is thus needed to improve anti-tumor effects and to decrease adverse reactions. EPRs are expected to serve as new therapeutic targets in urological cancer, because they are more selective in malignant phenotypes.

We used the Cox proportional hazard regression model to analyse the association between different risk factors and progression-free survival over successive biopsies.

Results:   The median follow-up of patients free of progression was 4.6 years. A total of 58 (28%) patients experienced progression. Factors significantly associated with progression were: overall number of positive cores in the diagnostic and first surveillance biopsies, race and prostate-specific antigen density. The bootstrapping concordance index of the nomogram including these variables was 81%. The nomogram tended to underestimate the probability of progression but it identified fairly accurately the distinct groups of patients at low, intermediate and high risk of progression.

Clinical experience suggests that patients view EFR as getting back to their baseline (BTB) erectile functioning (EF) without the use of medication.  Aim:   This study explores EFR defined as BTB.  Method:   Men pre-RP and 24 months post-RP completed the Erectile Function Domain (EFD) of the International Index of Erectile Function and one question on phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor (PDE5i) use. Men using a PDE5i at baseline were excluded.  Main outcome measures:   At 24 m, ""back to baseline"" was defined as achieving the baseline EFD score (within 1 point or higher). Analyses included descriptive statistics, chi-square, and logistic regression.  Results:   One hundred eighty men had an average age at RP of 59 (SD = 7) years. When including men who were using a PDE5i at 24 months, 43% (N = 78, 95% CI: 36-51%) returned BTB. When considering BTB without the use of a PDE5i, 22% (N = 39, 95% CI: 16% to 28%) returned BTB. When focusing on a subset of men with baseline EFD ≥ 24 (N = 132), 36% (N = 47, 95% CI: 28% to 44%) returned BTB at 24 months using a PDE5i and 16% (N = 21, 95% CI: 11% to 23%) without the use of a PDE5i. For this group, there was a significant difference by age (<60 years, 23% vs. ≥ 60 years, 4%, P < 0.001), which remained a significant predictor (OR = 6.25, 95% CI: 1.88 to 50, P < 0.001) in multivariable analysis.  Conclusions:   Twenty-two percent of the entire sample and 16% of the men with functional (EFD ≥ 24) baseline erections returned to BTB EF without the use of medication. Only 4% of men who were ≥ 60 years old with functional erections pre-surgery achieved BTB EF.

Background:   Men receiving treatments for localised prostate cancer experience symptoms of urinary incontinence, urinary obstruction/irritation, bowel difficulties and sexual dysfunction. Understanding patients' symptom experiences and identifying strategies that they use to manage these symptoms are imperative for symptom management planning.  Design:   A descriptive, cross-sectional study was conducted with a sample of 53 men, who were within three months of the initiation of their treatment.  Methods:   The Symptom Indexes and the Strategy and Effectiveness of Symptom Self-Management questionnaires were used to measure symptoms, symptom distress and symptom self-management. Descriptive statistics, t-tests, correlations and multiple regressions were used to analyse the data.  Results:   Symptoms were significantly correlated with symptom-related distress (r = 0·67, p < 0·01). Frequency of symptoms was significantly associated with symptom self-management strategies for urinary (β = 0·50, p < 0·01), bowel (β = 0·71, p < 0·01) and sexual problems (β = 0·28, p = 0·05). The most effective strategies were as follows: pads and doing Kegel exercise for managing urinary problems, rest and endurance for bowel symptoms, and expressing feelings and finding alternative ways to express affection for management of sexual dysfunction.  Conclusions:   Assessing symptom self-management among men with newly diagnosed prostate cancer can help healthcare providers develop strategies that will enhance health-related quality of life.  Relevance to clinical practice:   Results provide information on effective strategies that patients with prostate cancer found to reduce their symptoms. The strategies used provide a foundation for developing and testing interventions for personalised symptom management.""","""['Chao-Pin Hsiao', 'Ida M Ki Moore', 'Kathleen C Insel', 'Carrie J Merkle']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Clin Nurs""","""['High perceived stress is linked to afternoon cortisol levels and greater symptom distress in patients with localized prostate cancer.', 'Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite versus Incontinence Symptom Index and Sexual Health Inventory for Men to measure functional outcomes after prostatectomy.', 'Symptom indexes to assess outcomes of treatment for early prostate cancer.', 'Management of localised prostate cancer: watchful waiting, surgery or radiation therapy, depending on the natural course, which is often relatively slow.', 'Symptoms and symptom distress in localized prostate cancer.', 'An exploration of symptom burden and its management, in Saudi Arabian patients receiving haemodialysis, and their caregivers: a mixed methods study protocol.', 'An ecological momentary assessment of self-management in prostate cancer survivors.', 'Beliefs that contribute to delays in diagnosis of prostate cancer among Afro-Caribbean men in Trinidad and Tobago.', 'Adherence to Report and Patient Perception of an Interactive App for Managing Symptoms During Radiotherapy for Prostate Cancer: Descriptive Study of Logged and Interview Data.', 'Effects of an interactive mHealth innovation for early detection of patient-reported symptom distress with focus on participatory care: protocol for a study based on prospective, randomised, controlled trials in patients with prostate and breast cancer.']"""

Methods:   A total of 55 men scheduled for radical prostatectomy, with biopsy-proven cancer in hypoechoic foci located in the peripheral zone, were consecutively enrolled in the present prospective study. Each patient underwent grayscale ultrasound and contrast-enhanced transrectal ultrasonography of the prostate according to a standardized protocol. The maximum tumor diameter on grayscale imaging and contrast-enhanced transrectal ultrasonography was compared with that determined using histopathology.  Results:   A mean underestimation was documented to be approximately 3.9 mm and 0.6 mm for grayscale and contrast-enhanced transrectal ultrasonography imaging, respectively. Grayscale and contrast-enhanced transrectal ultrasonography imaging underestimated measurements by 76.67% (46 of 60) and 48.33% (29 of 60), whereas overestimated measurements were 20% (12 of 60) and 26.67% (16 of 60), respectively. A strong correlation was observed between contrast-enhanced transrectal ultrasonography and histopathological measurements (r = 0.91, P < 0.0001). A weak linear correlation was found between grayscale and histopathological measurements (r = 0.59, P < 0.0001).

Brachytherapy was given either as monotherapy (n = 169) or with external beam radiation therapy (EBRT; n = 67). Forty-four patients (19%) received neoadjuvant cytoreductive hormone therapy. The 'nadir+2' definition was used for prostate-specific antigen (PSA) recurrence. Common Terminology Criteria for Acute Events (CTCAE) v 3.0 was used to grade genitourinary (GU) and gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity. Potency was defined as the ability to obtain an erection suitable for intercourse or an International Index of Erectile Function score ≥ 22. The Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression were used for statistical analysis. The median follow-up was 83 months.  Results:   The 8-year PSA relapse-free survival (RFS), cancer-specific and overall survival rates for the entire cohort were 96, 99 and 96%, respectively. For patients with low-risk disease, the 8-year PSA RFS rate was 97% and for intermediate-risk patients it was 94% (P = 0.34). There was no difference in PSA RFS between BT alone and combined therapy (P = 0.17). Late grade ≥ 2 GU and GI toxicity was 14 and 3%, respectively.

Patients and methods:   We conducted a prospective study of 409 consecutive men who underwent TPB between December 2006 and June 2008 in a tertiary referral centre using a standardized 14-region technique. The procedure was performed as day surgery under general anaesthesia with fluoroquinolone antibiotic cover. Follow-up took place within 2 weeks, during which time men were interviewed using a standardized template. Results were compared with those of the Australian national prostate biopsy audits performed by the Urological Society of Australia and New Zealand (USANZ).  Results:   Indications for biopsy included elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level (75%), with a median PSA level of 6.5 ng/mL, abnormal digital rectal examination (8%) and active surveillance (AS) re-staging (18%). The mean patient age was 63 years and two-thirds of patients were undergoing their first biopsy. A positive biopsy was found in 232 men, 74% of whom had a Gleason score of ≥7. The overall cancer detection rate was 56.7% (USANZ 2005 national audit = 56.5%). Stratified between those having their first TPB or a repeat procedure (after a previous negative biopsy), the detection rates were 64.4 and 35.6%, respectively. Significantly higher detection rates were found in prostates <50 mL in volume than in larger prostates (65.2 vs 38.3%, respectively, P < 0.001). Haematuria was the most common side effect (51.7%). Others included dysuria (16.4%), acute urinary retention (4.2%) and fever (3.2%). One patient (0.2%) had septicaemia requiring i.v. antibiotics. Repeat biopsy was not associated with increased complication rates.  Conclusions:   TPB is a safe and efficacious technique, with a cancer detection rate of 56.7% in the present series, and a low incidence of major side effects. Stratified by prostate volume, the detection rate of TPB was higher in smaller glands. Given the relatively low rate of serious complications, clinicians could consider increasing the number of TPB biopsy cores in larger prostates as a strategy to improve cancer detection within this group. Conversely, in patients on AS programmes, a staging TPB may be a superior approach for patients undergoing repeat biopsy so as to minimize their risk of serious infection.""","""['James L Symons', 'Andrew Huo', 'Carlo L Yuen', 'Anne-Maree Haynes', 'Jayne Matthews', 'Robert L Sutherland', 'Phillip Brenner', 'Phillip D Stricker']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Transperineal magnetic resonance imaging--ultrasound fusion targeted biopsies (MRI-US FTB) of the prostate: the future of prostate diagnostics.', 'High detection rate of significant prostate tumours in anterior zones using transperineal ultrasound-guided template saturation biopsy.', 'Transperineal biopsy prostate cancer detection in first biopsy and repeat biopsy after negative transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy: the Victorian Transperineal Biopsy Collaboration experience.', 'Morbidity after transperineal prostate biopsy in 3000 patients undergoing 12 vs 18 vs more than 24 needle cores.', 'Prostate biopsy: who, how and when.

Brief questionnaires are advantageous to reduce patient burden. In large clinical trials, statistically significant small changes can be achieved; however, whether such change is clinically relevant is unknown. The purpose of this study was to determine the minimal important differences (MID) of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer quality of life core 15 palliative questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C15-PAL).  Methods:   Patients undergoing palliative radiotherapy completed the EORTC QLQ-C15-PAL at baseline and 1 month later. Anchor and distribution-based assessments were employed to determine the MID associated with this instrument. The anchor of overall QOL was used to determine meaningful change.  Results:   In all, 276 patients were included in MID calculation. Mean age was 65 years and primary lung, breast or prostate cancers were most common. Statistically significant MID for improvement was seen in emotional functioning and pain (20.9 and 15.6, respectively). MID for deterioration required a 20.4, 24.5, 17.1 and 23.0 change in physical functioning, fatigue, pain and appetite loss, respectively, to constitute meaningful change. Distribution-based estimates of MID were closest to the standard error of measurement. MID for brain and bone metastases patients yielded MID larger than previously determined in the incorporation of all patients.  Conclusion:   Meaningful change in the EORTC QLQ-C15-PAL is important for clinicians to determine the impact of treatment on the QOL of patients and can aid in determining the sample size required for clinical trials.

Recently, the European Association of Urology Robotic Urology Section (ERUS) supported the Pasadena Consensus Conference on best practices in RARP.  Subjects and methods:   This survey was performed in January 2012. A specific questionnaire was sent, by e-mail, to 145 robotic surgeons who were included in the mailing-list of ERUS members and working in different urological institutions. Participating surgeons were invited to answer a multiple-choice questionnaire including 24-items evaluating the main RARP surgical steps.  Results:   In all, 116 (79.4%) invited surgeons answered the questionnaire and accepted to participate to the ERUS survey. In all, 47 (40.5%) surgeons performed >100 RARPs; 41 (35.3%) between 50 and 100, and 28 (24.1%) <50 yearly. The transperitoneal, antegrade technique was the preferred approach. Minimising bladder neck dissection and the use of athermal dissection of the neurovascular bundles (NVBs) were also popular. There was more heterogeneity in the use of energy for seminal vesicle dissection, the preservation of the tips of the seminal vesicle and the choice between intra- and interfascial planes during the antero-lateral dissection of the NVBs. There was also large variability in the posterior and/or anterior reconstruction steps.  Conclusions:   The present study is the first international survey evaluating surgeon preferences during RARP.

Replacing androgens before progression of the disease is hypothesized to prolong androgen dependence.  Methods:   Men with newly diagnosed, metastatic, hormone-sensitive prostate cancer, a performance status of 0 to 2, and a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level of 5 ng per milliliter or higher received a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogue and an antiandrogen agent for 7 months. We then randomly assigned patients in whom the PSA level fell to 4 ng per milliliter or lower to continuous or intermittent androgen deprivation, with patients stratified according to prior or no prior hormonal therapy, performance status, and extent of disease (minimal or extensive). The coprimary objectives were to assess whether intermittent therapy was noninferior to continuous therapy with respect to survival, with a one-sided test with an upper boundary of the hazard ratio of 1.20, and whether quality of life differed between the groups 3 months after randomization.  Results:   A total of 3040 patients were enrolled, of whom 1535 were included in the analysis: 765 randomly assigned to continuous androgen deprivation and 770 assigned to intermittent androgen deprivation. The median follow-up period was 9.8 years. Median survival was 5.8 years in the continuous-therapy group and 5.1 years in the intermittent-therapy group (hazard ratio for death with intermittent therapy, 1.10; 90% confidence interval, 0.99 to 1.23). Intermittent therapy was associated with better erectile function and mental health (P<0.001 and P=0.003, respectively) at month 3 but not thereafter. There were no significant differences between the groups in the number of treatment-related high-grade adverse events.  Conclusions:   Our findings were statistically inconclusive. In patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer, the confidence interval for survival exceeded the upper boundary for noninferiority, suggesting that we cannot rule out a 20% greater risk of death with intermittent therapy than with continuous therapy, but too few events occurred to rule out significant inferiority of intermittent therapy. Intermittent therapy resulted in small improvements in quality of life.

Each one of these translocations results in deregulated expression of one of the ETS proteins. Here, we focus on the mechanism whereby overexpression of the ETV4 gene mediates oncogenesis in the prostate. By siRNA technology, we show that ETV4 inhibition in the PC3 cancer cell line reduces not only cell mobility and anchorage-independent growth, but also cell proliferation, cell cycle progression and tumor growth in a xenograft model. Conversely, ETV4 overexpression in the nonmalignant human prostate cell line (RWPE) increases anchorage-independent growth, cell mobility and cell proliferation, which is probably mediated by downregulation of p21, producing accelerated progression through the cell cycle. ETV4 overexpression is associated with changes in the pattern of E-cadherin and N-cadherin expression; the cells also become spindle-shaped, and these changes are characteristic of the so-called epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). In RWPE cells overexpressing ETV4 EMT results from a marked increase in EMT-specific transcription factors such as TWIST1, SLUG1, ZEB1 and ZEB2. Thus, whereas ETV4 shares with the other ETS proteins (ERG, ETV5 and ETV1) a major role in invasiveness and cell migration, it emerges as unique in that it increases at the same time also the rate of proliferation of PC cells. Considering the wide spectrum in the clinical course of patients with PC, it may be highly relevant that ETV4 is capable of inducing most and perhaps all of the features that make a tumor aggressive.""","""['A Pellecchia', 'C Pescucci', 'E De Lorenzo', 'C Luceri', 'N Passaro', 'M Sica', 'R Notaro', 'M De Angioletti']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""Oncogenesis""","""['The ETS gene ETV4 is required for anchorage-independent growth and a cell proliferation gene expression program in PC3 prostate cells.', 'Specific and redundant activities of ETV1 and ETV4 in prostate cancer aggressiveness revealed by co-overexpression cellular contexts.', 'Overexpression of ETV4 is associated with poor prognosis in prostate cancer: involvement of uPA/uPAR and MMPs.', 'Function and regulation of the PEA3 subfamily of ETS transcription factors in cancer.', 'ETV1, 4 and 5: an oncogenic subfamily of ETS transcription factors.', 'Prognostic Values of Gene Copy Number Alterations in Prostate Cancer.', 'Identification and characterization of novel ETV4 splice variants in prostate cancer.', 'Portrait of Molecular Signaling and Putative Therapeutic Targets in Prostate Cancer with ETV4 Fusion.', 'Reliable epithelial-mesenchymal transition biomarkers for colorectal cancer detection.', 'Allelic imbalance of chromatin accessibility in cancer identifies candidate causal risk variants and their mechanisms.']"""

The association of p53 codon72 polymorphism with prostate cancer has been widely reported; however, the results are inconsistent. To derive a more precise estimation of this relationship, we performed an updated meta-analysis from 10 case-control studies. We conducted a search in the PubMed database without a language limitation, covering all papers published until July 2010. Risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to assess the strength of the association. Ten studies including 1,196 cases and 1,704 controls were selected. Overall, no significant differences of total prostate cancer risk and p53 codon polymorphism was found (Pro/Pro vs Arg/Arg, RR = 1.12, 95%CI=0.74-1.70, P heterogeneity = 0.016, I (2) = 55.8%; Pro/Pro+Pro/Arg vs Arg/Arg, RR = 1.05, 95%CI=1.00-1.11, P heterogeneity = 0.077, I (2) = 51.1%). In the stratified analysis by ethnicity, the same results were found. However, in the control subgroup, there was a modest decreased association between prostate cancer risk and population-based control subjects under the recessive genetic model (RR = 0.31, 95%CI=0.10-0.91, P heterogeneity = 0.110, I (2) =60.8%).

While MMPs are thought to regulate the dynamics of extracellular matrix turnover, new evidence shows that these enzymes may play a critical regulatory role in inflammation. To investigate the role of MMP-26 in inflammation, three different variants of androgen repressed human prostate cancer (ARCaP) cells were investigated in the study: parental, MMP-26 sense cDNA-transfected, and MMP-26 antisense cDNA-transfected ARCaP cells. Protein lysates and RNA from control and genetically modified cells were analyzed by Western blotting and real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction on arrays of genes critical to the inflammatory response. In comparison to parental controls, up-regulation of MMP-26 expression in MMP-26 sense cDNA-transfected cells resulted in a decrease in inflammatory genes expression. Conversely, inflammatory genes were up-regulated in MMP-26 antisense cDNA-transfected cells. Therefore, modulation of MMP-26 levels significantly affects the expression of inflammatory genes, suggesting an anti-inflammatory role of MMP-26. To determine a possible mechanism of action, further analysis, at both transcript and protein levels, revealed a dramatic down-regulation of interleukin-10 receptor B (IL10RB) in MMP-26 antisense cDNA-transfected cells. The low level of IL10RB was inversely correlated with matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) expression. Collectively, our data suggest that the deficiency of MMP-26 may promote inflammation via inhibition of IL10RB-mediated signaling. These results propose a novel anti-inflammation function of MMP-26 and could provide novel molecular insight of therapeutic targeting.""","""['Zahraa I Khamis', 'Diego A R Zorio', 'Leland W K Chung', 'Qing-Xiang Amy Sang']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Cancer""","""['Evidence for a Proapoptotic Role of Matrix Metalloproteinase-26 in Human Prostate Cancer Cells and Tissues.', 'Activation of pro-gelatinase B by endometase/matrilysin-2 promotes invasion of human prostate cancer cells.', 'Effects of detergents on catalytic activity of human endometase/matrilysin 2, a putative cancer biomarker.', 'Calcium regulates tertiary structure and enzymatic activity of human endometase/matrilysin-2 and its role in promoting human breast cancer cell invasion.', 'Association of ets-related transcriptional factor E1AF expression with tumour progression and overexpression of MMP-1 and matrilysin in human colorectal cancer.', 'Combined Effects of MMP-7, MMP-8 and MMP-26 on the Risk of Ischemic Stroke.', 'Evidence for a Proapoptotic Role of Matrix Metalloproteinase-26 in Human Prostate Cancer Cells and Tissues.']"""

For localized PCa, 5-year CSS and MFS were significantly higher in noncarriers (96% v 82%; MVA P = .01; HR = 2.6%; and 93% v 77%; MVA P = .009; HR = 2.7, respectively). Subgroup analyses confirmed the poor outcomes in BRCA2 patients, whereas the role of BRCA1 was not well defined due to the limited size and follow-up in this subgroup.  Conclusion:   Our results confirm that BRCA1/2 mutations confer a more aggressive PCa phenotype with a higher probability of nodal involvement and distant metastasis. BRCA mutations are associated with poor survival outcomes and this should be considered for tailoring clinical management of these patients.""","""['Elena Castro', 'Chee Goh', 'David Olmos', 'Ed Saunders', 'Daniel Leongamornlert', 'Malgorzata Tymrakiewicz', 'Nadiya Mahmud', 'Tokhir Dadaev', 'Koveela Govindasami', 'Michelle Guy', 'Emma Sawyer', 'Rosemary Wilkinson', 'Audrey Ardern-Jones', 'Steve Ellis', 'Debra Frost', 'Susan Peock', 'D Gareth Evans', 'Marc Tischkowitz', 'Trevor Cole', 'Rosemarie Davidson', 'Diana Eccles', 'Carole Brewer', 'Fiona Douglas', 'Mary E Porteous', 'Alan Donaldson', 'Huw Dorkins', 'Louise Izatt', 'Jackie Cook', 'Shirley Hodgson', 'M John Kennedy', 'Lucy E Side', 'Jacqueline Eason', 'Alex Murray', 'Antonis C Antoniou', 'Douglas F Easton', 'Zsofia Kote-Jarai', 'Rosalind Eeles']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Clin Oncol""","""['Re: Germline BRCA mutations are associated with higher risk of nodal involvement, distant metastasis, and poor survival outcomes in prostate cancer.', 'Effect of BRCA Mutations on Metastatic Relapse and Cause-specific Survival After Radical Treatment for Localised Prostate Cancer.', 'The association of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations with prostate cancer risk, frequency, and mortality: A meta-analysis.', 'Re: Germline BRCA mutations are associated with higher risk of nodal involvement, distant metastasis, and poor survival outcomes in prostate cancer.', 'Clinical features and management of BRCA1 and BRCA2-associated prostate cancer.', 'Overall Survival and Clinical Characteristics of BRCA-Associated Cholangiocarcinoma: A Multicenter Retrospective Study.', 'Genomic and Phenotypic Biomarkers for Precision Medicine Guidance in Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'Performance of clinical risk scores and prediction models to identify pathogenic germline variants in patients with advanced prostate cancer.', 'Investigation of Clinically Significant Molecular Aberrations in Patients with Prostate Cancer: Implications for Personalized Treatment, Prognosis and Genetic Testing.', 'The Effect of Inactivating Heterozygous Mutation in NBS1 Gene on DNA Damage and Repair Markers and Apoptosis Markers in Mice.', 'Usefulness of BRCA and ctDNA as Prostate Cancer Biomarkers: A Meta-Analysis.']"""

PATIENTS AND METHODS In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase III study, patients received intravenous docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) on day 1 of 21-day cycles plus oral zibotentan 10 mg or placebo once daily. The primary end point was overall survival (OS). Secondary end points included time to pain and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression, pain and PSA response, progression-free survival, health-related quality of life, and safety. Results A total of 1,052 patients received study treatment (docetaxel-zibotentan, n = 524; docetaxel-placebo, n = 528). At the time of data cutoff, there had been 277 and 280 deaths, respectively. There was no difference in OS for patients receiving docetaxel-zibotentan compared with those receiving docetaxel-placebo (hazard ratio, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.84 to 1.18; P = .963). No significant differences were observed on secondary end points, including time to pain progression (median 9.3 v 10.0 months, respectively) or pain response (odds ratio, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.61 to 1.16; P = .283). The median time to death was 20.0 and 19.2 months for the zibotentan and placebo groups, respectively. The most commonly reported adverse events in zibotentan-treated patients were peripheral edema (52.7%), diarrhea (35.4%), alopecia (33.9%), and nausea (33.3%).

In this study, the isolation and characterization of a compound from the aromatic berries of Pimenta dioica (allspice) that silences AR is presented. Potential antitumor activities of an aqueous allspice extract (AAE) and a compound purified from the extract were tested on CaP cells. AAE inhibited tumor cell proliferation and colony formation (50% growth inhibition ∼40-85 µg/ml) but not the viability of quiescent normal fibroblasts or non-tumorigenic prostate cells. In tumor cells, AAE inhibited cell cycle progression at G1/S, induced apoptosis or autophagy. Apoptosis was by caspase-dependent poly (ADP ribose) polymerase cleavage. A caspase-independent, apoptosis-inducing factor-mediated mechanism of apoptosis caused cell death in castration-resistant AR-positive or AR-negative CaP cells, such as CWR22RV1, PC-3 or DU145 cells. Treatment with AAE decreased the levels of AR messenger RNA (mRNA), protein and silenced AR activity in AR-positive cells. AR depletion was due to inhibition of AR promoter activity and mRNA stability. Delayed tumor growth (~55%) without measurable systemic toxicity was observed in LNCaP tumor-bearing mice treated with AAE by oral or intraperitoneal routes. LNCaP tumor tissues from AAE-treated mice revealed increased apoptosis as a potential mechanism of antitumor activity of AAE. The chemical identity of bioactive compound in AAE was established through multistep high-performance liquid chromatography fractionation, mass and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopies. The compound, eugenol 5-O-β-(6'-galloylglucopyranoside) or ericifolin (EF), showed antiproliferative, pro-apoptosis and anti-AR transcription activities.

In all, 39 castrate-resistant prostate cancer patients were treated with 3-weekly docetaxel at 75 mg/m(2) and prednisolone 10 mg daily between January 2006 and December 2011 in Queen Elizabeth Hospital. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES. Prostate-specific antigen control rate, pain control rate, progression-free survival, overall survival, and complication rates. RESULTS. The prostate-specific antigen response rate was 36%, and 27 (69%) of the patients had improved pain control after chemotherapy. The median progression-free survival, cancer-specific survival, and overall survival was 7.8 (95% confidence interval, 4.9-10.8) months, 13.0 (95% confidence interval, 9.6-16.3) months, and 12.2 (95% confidence interval, 9.3-15.1) months, respectively.

Using available data, the U.S. Preventative Services Task Force recently recommended against PSA screening for prostate cancer. However, prostate cancer continues to kill over 30,000 men annually, and as such, completely abandoning screening for this disease is a disservice to many patients.

A total of 138 patients with prostate (55.6%), breast (32.5%), and other solid tumors (11.9%) were randomized to a home-based walking intervention or usual care. Exercise dose was assessed using a five-item subscale of the Cooper Aerobics Center Longitudinal Study Physical Activity Questionnaire. Primary outcomes of sleep quality, distress, and fatigue were compared between the two study arms. Results. The exercise group (n = 68) reported more vigor (p = .03) than control group participants (n = 58). In dose response models, greater participation in aerobic exercise was associated with 11% less fatigue (p < .001), 7.5% more vigor (p = .001), and 3% less emotional distress (p = .03), after controlling for intervention group assignment, age, and baseline exercise and fatigue levels. Conclusion. Patients who exercised during cancer treatment experienced less emotional distress than those who were less active. Increasing exercise was also associated with less fatigue and more vigor.

As PSA is the primary method for prostate cancer (PC) screening, this confounds any associations between statins and risk of being diagnosed with PC. Thus, we examined the association between statins and cancer and high-grade cancer in REDUCE, where biopsies were largely PSA-independent.  Methods:   Post-hoc secondary analysis of REDUCE, which was a prospective multinational randomized controlled trial of dutasteride vs placebo for 4 years among men aged 50-75 years with PSA of 2.5-10.0 ng ml(-1) and a negative biopsy at baseline, and included PSA-independent biopsies mandated at 2- and 4-years. Analyses were limited to men who underwent at least one biopsy while under study (n=6729). The association between baseline statin use and risk of overall, high-grade (Gleason ≥ 7) or low-grade (Gleason ≤ 6) PC vs no cancer was examined using multinomial logistic regression adjusting for age, race, baseline PSA, prostate volume, rectal examination findings, body mass index (BMI), comorbidities, smoking, alcohol intake and treatment arm.  Results:   Of 6729 men who had at least one biopsy while on study, 1174 (17.5%) were taking a statin at baseline. Men taking statins were older, had lower PSA levels, higher BMI values and lower serum testosterone and dihydrotestosterone levels, though differences, were slight. Statin use was not associated with overall PC diagnosis (multivariable OR 1.05, 95% CI 0.89-1.24, P=0.54). When stratified by grade, statin use was not associated with low-grade (multivariable OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.85-1.25, P=0.75) or high-grade cancer (multivariable OR 1.11, 95% CI 0.85-1.45, P=0.46).

The volumes of the targets coupled onto the beads and their complementary Abs were optimized. The suspension array standard curves correlated well with PCa biomarkers (R(2)>0.9968). PCa biomarker levels were quantified using median fluorescent intensities.

It is now clear that CSCs are involved in tumor growth and recurrence, and resistance to conventional treatments. The sonic hedgehog (Shh) pathway has a crucial role in stemness and tumorigenesis. Thus, the strategy that suppresses stemness and consequently tumorigenic potential of CSCs could be considered for the management of prostate cancer. The objectives of this study were to examine the molecular mechanisms, by which NVP-LDE-225/Erismodegib (smoothened inhibitor) regulates stem cell characteristics and tumor growth in prostate cancer. The effects of NVP-LDE-225 on CSC's viability, sphere formation, apoptosis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and tumor growth in NOD/SCID IL2Rγ null mice were examined. NVP-LDE-225 inhibited cell viability and spheroid formation, and induced apoptosis by activation of caspase-3 and cleavage of poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP). NVP-LDE-225 induced expression of Bax and Bak, and inhibited the expression of Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, XIAP, cIAP1, cIAP2 and survivin. NVP-LDE-225 inhibited Gli transcriptional activity, Gli-DNA interaction and the expression of Gli1, Gli2, Patched1 and Patched-2 in prostate CSCs. Interestingly, NVP-LDE-225 induced PDCD4 and apoptosis and inhibited cell viability by suppressing miR-21. Furthermore, NVP-LDE-225 inhibited pluripotency-maintaining factors Nanog, Oct-4, c-Myc and Sox-2. The inhibition of Bmi-1 by NVP-LDE-225 was regulated by upregulation of miR-128. NVP-LDE-225 suppressed EMT by upregulating E-cadherin and inhibiting N-cadherin, Snail, Slug and Zeb1 by regulating the miR-200 family. Finally, NVP-LDE-225 inhibited CSC tumor growth, which was associated with the suppression of Gli1, Gli2, Patched-1, Patched-2, Cyclin D1, Bmi-1 and PCNA and cleavage of caspase-3 and PARP in tumor tissues derived from NOD/SCID IL2Rγ null mice.

However, the distinct roles of the AKT isoforms in prostate cancer cells are largely unknown. In the present study, we demonstrate distinct roles for AKT1 and AKT2 in cell growth and migration. Ablation of AKT1 and AKT2 decreased the proliferation of the androgen-independent cell line PC-3, although by different mechanisms. AKT1 ablation induced loss of cell adhesion and subsequent apoptosis. AKT2 (but not AKT1) ablation promoted cell cycle arrest at G0/G1, associated with downregulation of cyclin D, CDK6 and CDK2, and upregulation and cytoplasmic-to-nuclear redistribution of p27. The increase of p27 protein levels was due to more gene transcription and an increase in protein stability. The increased stability of p27 was induced by delocalisation of Skp2 and a lower level of p27 phosphorylation at Thr187. AKT1 and AKT2 ablation inhibited and stimulated PC-3 cell migration, respectively. An AKT isoform-specific function could be associated with its subcellular localization. We found that AKT1 and AKT2 were mainly localised in the cytoplasm and nucleus, respectively. In androgen-sensitive cell line LNCaP, the ablation of AKT1 or AKT2 caused apoptosis but in androgen-independent LNCaP sublines, the effect of AKT1 ablation was lower; whereas no changes were observed after AKT2 ablation. Taken together, our data show that AKT1 and AKT2 have non-redundant roles in the regulation of PC-3 cell proliferation and migration. These could be explained by their subcellular localization and/or the specific regulation of downstream effectors. Furthermore, contribution of AKT isoforms to the progression of prostate cancer may change from an androgen-sensitive to a hormone-refractory stage. These findings may help design new targeted strategies for inhibiting AKT isoforms in prostate cancer.""","""['Ariel E Cariaga-Martinez', 'Pilar López-Ruiz', 'M Paz Nombela-Blanco', 'Omar Motiño', 'Ana González-Corpas', 'Javier Rodriguez-Ubreva', 'María V T Lobo', 'M Alicia Cortés', 'Begoña Colás']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Cell Signal""","""['Roles of AKT1 and AKT2 in non-small cell lung cancer cell survival, growth, and migration.', 'Role of PI3K and AKT specific isoforms in ovarian cancer cell migration, invasion and proliferation through the p70S6K1 pathway.', 'Akt isoform-specific inhibition of MDA-MB-231 cell proliferation.', 'Distinct functions of AKT isoforms in breast cancer: a comprehensive review.', 'Androgens as therapy for androgen receptor-positive castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'PTEN regulated PI3K-p110 and AKT isoform plasticity controls metastatic prostate cancer progression.', 'Diarylpentanoid (1,5-bis(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-1,4-pentadiene-3-one) (MS13) Exhibits Anti-proliferative, Apoptosis Induction and Anti-migration Properties on Androgen-independent Human Prostate Cancer by Targeting Cell Cycle-Apoptosis and PI3K Signalling Pathways.', 'Targeting Signaling Pathway Networks in Several Malignant Tumors: Progresses and Challenges.', 'miRNA-193a-3p Regulates the AKT2 Pathway to Inhibit the Growth and Promote the Apoptosis of Glioma Cells by Targeting ALKBH5.', 'Development and characterization of protein kinase B/AKT isoform-specific nanobodies.']"""

Vav3 enhances androgen receptor (AR) activity during progression to androgen independence in prostate cancer. We examined Vav3 small interfering RNA (siRNA) effects on cell proliferation and apoptosis in docetaxel-treated LNCaP cells under chronic hypoxia (LNCaPH).  Methods:   We examined individual and combined effects of Vav3 siRNA (si-Vav3) and docetaxel on cell growth and apoptosis under chronic hypoxia by cell proliferation, flow cytometric, DNA fragmentation, and immunoblot analyses. To clarify the molecular basis of si-Vav3- and docetaxel-induced apoptosis, we analyzed alterations in phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt, extracellular signal-regulate kinase (ERK), c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and AR pathways using kinase inhibitors in LNCaPH cells. The effects of si-Vav3/atelocollagen complex alone or in combination with docetaxel were assessed on xenografts in nude mice by tumor growth delay.  Results:   Vav3 overexpression was observed in LNCaPH compared with the expression under normoxia. Interrupting Vav3 signaling using siRNA enhanced docetaxel-induced cell growth suppression compared with that induced by docetaxel alone by inhibition of Akt and ERK phosphorylation, resulting in AR phosphorylation inhibition. In addition to increased B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) phosphorylation through JNK signaling in response to docetaxel, si-Vav3 enhanced docetaxel-induced apoptosis, as characterized by the accumulation of sub-G1 phase cells and DNA fragmentation, through Bcl-xL/Bcl-2-associated death promoter (Bad) dephosphorylation, resulting in increased caspase-9, caspase-3, and cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase activation. Xenograft tumor growth was slightly inhibited by si-Vav3/atelocollagen complex injection and combined use of si-Vav3/atelocollagen complex and docetaxel produced a greater effect than docetaxel alone.  Conclusions:   Interrupting Vav3 signaling enhances docetaxel-induced apoptosis in LNCaP cells under chronic hypoxia by inhibiting the PI3K/Akt, ERK, and AR signaling pathways.

Cell and gene specific regulation by the AR is determined by availability of and interaction with sets of key accessory cofactors. Ski-interacting protein (SKIP; SNW1, NCOA62) is a cofactor shown to interact with several NRs and a diverse range of other transcription factors. Interestingly, SKIP as part of the spliceosome is thought to link mRNA splicing with transcription. SKIP has not been previously shown to interact with the AR.  Results:   The aim of this study was to investigate whether SKIP interacts with the AR and modulates AR-dependent transcription. Here, we show by co-immunoprecipitation experiments that SKIP is in a complex with the AR. Moreover, SKIP increased 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) induced N-terminal/C-terminal AR interaction from 12-fold to almost 300-fold in a two-hybrid assay, and enhanced AR ligand-independent AF-1 transactivation. SKIP augmented ligand- and AR-dependent transactivation in PC3 prostate cancer cells. Live-cell imaging revealed a fast (half-time=129 s) translocation of AR from the cytoplasm to the nucleus upon DHT-stimulation. Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments suggest a direct AR-SKIP interaction in the nucleus upon translocation.

This is due in part to the emergence of castration- recurrent prostate cancer in patients with advanced disease who have failed androgen deprivation therapy. The androgen receptor is still a major player in castration-recurrent disease, and though much has been discovered since the early work of Huggins and Hodges regarding how prostate cancer cells manage to avoid the effects of androgen deprivation, survival times for men with advanced prostate cancer have changed only modestly. Research is now directed toward delineating the mechanisms of action of the androgen receptor under castrate conditions, whether through amplification of the AR, mutation, expression of splice variants, use of alternate signaling pathways, aberrant expression and activation of coregulators, or intratumoral androgen biosynthesis.

The aim of this study was to examine the prognostic impact of RBM3 expression in urinary bladder cancer.  Methods:   Immunohistochemical RBM3 expression was examined in tumours from 343 patients with urothelial bladder cancer. Chi-square and Spearman's correlation tests were applied to explore associations between RBM3 expression and clinicopathological characteristics. The impact of RBM3 expression on disease-specific survival (DSS), 5-year overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) was assessed by Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards modelling.  Results:   Reduced nuclear RBM3 expression was significantly associated with more advanced tumour (T) stage (p <0.001) and high grade tumours (p=0.004). Negative RBM3 expression was associated with a significantly shorter DSS (HR=2.55; 95% CI 1.68-3.86)) and 5-year OS (HR=2.10; 95% CI 1.56-2.82), also in multivariable analysis (HR=1.65; 95% CI 1.07-2.53 for DSS and HR=1.54; 95% CI 1.13-2.10 for 5-year OS). In patients with Ta and T1 tumours expressing reduced RBM3 levels, Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed a significantly shorter PFS (p=0.048) and 5-year OS (p=0.006).  Conclusion:   Loss of RBM3 expression is associated with clinically more aggressive tumours and an independent factor of poor prognosis in patients with urothelial bladder cancer and a potentially useful biomarker for treatment stratification and surveillance of disease progression.""","""['Karolina Boman', 'Ulrika Segersten', 'Göran Ahlgren', 'Jakob Eberhard', 'Mathias Uhlén', 'Karin Jirström', 'Per-Uno Malmström']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""BMC Urol""","""['Pre-clinical and clinical studies on the role of RBM3 in muscle-invasive bladder cancer: longitudinal expression, transcriptome-level effects and modulation of chemosensitivity.', 'High MCM3 expression is an independent biomarker of poor prognosis and correlates with reduced RBM3 expression in a prospective cohort of malignant melanoma.', 'Low RBM3 protein expression correlates with tumour progression and poor prognosis in malignant melanoma: an analysis of 215 cases from the Malmö Diet and Cancer Study.', 'Podocalyxin-like and RNA-binding motif protein 3 are prognostic biomarkers in urothelial bladder cancer: a validatory study.', 'Loss of aquaporin 3 protein expression constitutes an independent prognostic factor for progression-free survival: an immunohistochemical study on stage pT1 urothelial bladder cancer.', 'RNA-Binding Proteins in Bladder Cancer.', 'RNA Binding Motif Protein 3 Promotes Cell Metastasis and Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition Through STAT3 Signaling Pathway in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.', 'Pre-clinical and clinical studies on the role of RBM3 in muscle-invasive bladder cancer: longitudinal expression, transcriptome-level effects and modulation of chemosensitivity.', 'RNA-binding proteins RBM-HuR, RBM3 and PODXL expression in urothelial carcinoma of the urinary bladder.

Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors were found to be ""synthetic lethal"" in cells deficient in BRCA1 and BRCA2 that impair homologous recombination. However, since many tumors, including prostate cancer (PCa) rarely have on such mutations, there is considerable interest in finding alternative determinants of PARP inhibitor sensitivity. We evaluated the effectiveness of radiation in combination with the PARP inhibitor, rucaparib in PCa cells. The combination index for clonogenic survival following radiation and rucaparib treatments revealed synergistic interactions in a panel of PCa cell lines, being strongest for LNCaP and VCaP cells that express ETS gene fusion proteins. These findings correlated with synergistic interactions for senescence activation, as indicated by β--galactosidase staining. Absence of PTEN and presence of ETS gene fusion thus facilitated activation of senescence, which contributed to decreased clonogenic survival. Increased radiosensitivity in the presence of rucaparib was associated with persistent DNA breaks, as determined by χ-H2AX, p53BP1, and Rad51 foci. VCaP cells, which harbor the TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion and PC3 cells that stably express a similar construct (fusion III) showed enhanced sensitivity towards rucaparib, which, in turn, increased the radiation response to a similar extent as the DNA-PKcs inhibitor NU7441. Rucaparib radiosensitized PCa cells, with a clear benefit of low dose-rate radiation (LDR) administered over a longer period of time that caused enhanced DNA damage. LDR mimicking brachytherapy, which is used successfully in the clinic, was most effective when combined with rucaparib by inducing persistent DNA damage and senescence, leading to decreased clonogenic survival. This combination was most effective in the presence of the TMPRSS2-ERG and in the absence of PTEN, indicating clinical potential for brachytherapy in patients with intermediate and high risk PCa.""","""['Payel Chatterjee', 'Gaurav S Choudhary', 'Arishya Sharma', 'Kamini Singh', 'Warren D Heston', 'Jay Ciezki', 'Eric A Klein', 'Alexandru Almasan']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['The TMPRSS2-ERG Gene Fusion Blocks XRCC4-Mediated Nonhomologous End-Joining Repair and Radiosensitizes Prostate Cancer Cells to PARP Inhibition.', 'Targeted radiosensitization of ETS fusion-positive prostate cancer through PARP1 inhibition.', 'TMPRSS2/ERG fusion gene expression alters chemo- and radio-responsiveness in cell culture models of androgen independent prostate cancer.', 'The progress of TMPRSS2-ETS gene fusions and their mechanism in prostate cancer.', 'Autophagy and PTEN in DNA damage-induced senescence.', 'Distinct mechanisms mediating therapy-induced cellular senescence in prostate cancer.', 'PTEN Loss Enhances Error-Prone DSB Processing and Tumor Cell Radiosensitivity by Suppressing RAD51 Expression and Homologous Recombination.', 'Targeting senescence as an anticancer therapy.', 'Pro-Survival Factor EDEM3 Confers Therapy Resistance in Prostate Cancer.', 'From Therapy Resistance to Targeted Therapies in Prostate Cancer.']"""

Elevated levels of Pim1 kinase were first discovered in human leukemia and lymphomas. However, more recently Pim1 was found to be increased in solid tumors, including pancreatic and prostate cancers, and has been proposed as a prognostic marker. Although the Pim kinases have been identified as oncogenes in transgenic models, they have weak transforming abilities on their own. However, they have been shown to greatly enhance the ability of other genes or chemical carcinogens to induce tumors. To explore the role of Pim1 in prostate cancer, we generated conditional Pim1 transgenic mice, expressed Pim1 in prostate epithelium, and analyzed the contribution of PIM1 to neoplastic initiation and progression. Accordingly, we explored the effect of PIM1 overexpression in 3 different settings: upon hormone treatment, during aging, and in combination with the absence of one Pten allele. We have found that Pim1 overexpression increased the severity of mouse prostate intraepithelial neoplasias (mPIN) moderately in all three settings. Furthermore, Pim1 overexpression, in combination with the hormone treatment, increased inflammation surrounding target tissues leading to pyelonephritis in transgenic animals. Analysis of senescence induced in these prostatic lesions showed that the lesions induced in the presence of inflammation exhibited different behavior than those induced in the absence of inflammation. While high grade prostate preneoplastic lesions, mPIN grades III and IV, in the presence of inflammation did not show any senescence markers and demonstrated high levels of Ki67 staining, untreated animals without inflammation showed senescence markers and had low levels of Ki67 staining in similar high grade lesions.

Materials and methods:   LNCaP and PC3 cells were subcutaneously injected into the right flank of athymic nude mice. Mice with grown tumours were used for in vivo efficacy studies. Firstly, we applied different doses of AlOH-PC to less aggressive LNCaP tumours to determine the effective dose. In later studies, we focused on more aggressive prostate tumours (PC3) using doses of liposomal-AlOH-PC gel formulation. Topical application of photosensitizers was followed by PDT irradiation (600-700 nm, 635 nm peak). Tumour growth was measured three times-a-week.  Results:   Comparison of PDT of aggressive PC3 and less aggressive LNCaP prostate carcinomas showed that both tumour types are sensitive and treatable by liposomal formulation of AlOH-PC. For LNCaP tumours the efficient dose (100% experimental animals cured, n=8/8) was 4.5 mg/ml of AlOH-PC in the gel. Whereas, in the case of PC3 carcinomas, a dose of 4 mg/ml significantly postponed tumour growth, but no animals were cured (n=0/8); a sufficient curative dose (100% mice cured, n=8/8) was 6 mg/ml of AlOH-PC in the gel.

Results:   We received questionnaires and reviewed charts for 585 patients (mean age 72.6, 2-13 years postdiagnosis). Mean utility scores were as follows: PORPUS-U = 0.92, HUI2 = 0.85, and HUI3 = 0.78.

Vitamin K-2 is involved in mitochondrial electron transport, SXR nuclear hormone receptor signaling and redox cycling: together these functions may form the basis for tumor suppressor function. To gain further insight into mechanisms of growth suppression and enzymatic regulation of TERE1 we isolated TERE1 associated proteins and identified the WD40 repeat, mitochondrial protein TBL2. We examined whether disease specific mutations in TERE1 affected interactions with TBL2 and the role of each protein in altering mitochondrial function, ROS/RNS production and SXR target gene regulation. Biochemical binding assays demonstrated a direct, high affinity interaction between TERE1 and TBL2 proteins; TERE1 was localized to both mitochondrial and non-mitochondrial membranes whereas TBL2 was predominantly mitochondrial; multiple independent single amino acid substitutions in TERE1 which cause a human hereditary corneal disease reduced binding to TBL2 strongly suggesting the relevance of this interaction.

Up-regulated expression of the Hh ligands, Sonic (Shh) and Desert (Dhh), has been reported in androgen-deprived and castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). In a cohort of therapy naive, short- and long-term neoadjuvant hormone therapy-treated (NHT), and CRPC specimens, we observed elevated Dhh expression predominantly in long-term NHT specimens and elevated Shh expression predominantly in CRPC specimens. Together with previously demonstrated reciprocal signaling between Shh-producing prostate cancer (PCa) cells and urogenital mesenchymal fibroblasts, these results suggest that castration-induced Hh expression promotes CRPC progression through reciprocal paracrine signaling within the tumor microenvironment. We tested whether the orally available Smoothened (Smo) antagonist, TAK-441, could impair castration-resistant progression of LNCaP PCa xenografts by disrupting paracrine Hh signaling. Although TAK-441 or cyclopamine did not affect androgen withdrawal-induced Shh up-regulation or viability of LNCaP cells, castration-resistant progression of LNCaP xenografts was significantly delayed in animals treated with TAK-441. In TAK-441-treated xenografts, expression of murine orthologs of the Hh-activated genes, Gli1, Gli2 and Ptch1, was substantially suppressed, while expression of the corresponding human orthologs was unaffected. As androgen-deprived LNCaP cells up-regulate Shh expression, but are not sensitive to Smo antagonists, these studies indicate that TAK-441 leads to delayed castration-resistant progression of LNCaP xenografts by disrupting paracrine Hh signaling with the tumor stroma. Thus, paracrine Hh signaling may offer unique opportunities for prognostic biomarker development, drug targeting and therapeutic response monitoring of PCa progression.""","""['Naokazu Ibuki', 'Mazyar Ghaffari', 'Mitali Pandey', 'Irene Iu', 'Ladan Fazli', 'Masahide Kashiwagi', 'Hideaki Tojo', 'Osamu Nakanishi', 'Martin E Gleave', 'Michael E Cox']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Int J Cancer""","""['Paracrine sonic hedgehog signaling contributes significantly to acquired steroidogenesis in the prostate tumor microenvironment.', 'Hedgehog/Gli supports androgen signaling in androgen deprived and androgen independent prostate cancer cells.', 'Inhibition of the hedgehog pathway targets the tumor-associated stroma in pancreatic cancer.', 'Small-molecule modulators of the Sonic Hedgehog signaling pathway.', 'Hedgehog inhibition as an anti-cancer strategy.', 'Genetic alterations in MED12 promote castration-resistant prostate cancer through modulation of GLI3 signaling.', 'GLI3 Is Stabilized by SPOP Mutations and Promotes Castration Resistance via Functional Cooperation with Androgen Receptor in Prostate Cancer.', 'Smoothened loss is a characteristic of neuroendocrine prostate cancer.', 'Targeting the Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition in Cancer Stem Cells for a Better Clinical Outcome of Glioma.', 'Ciliary Genes in Renal Cystic Diseases.']"""

However, the PSA 'grey zone' in Asian men should be higher because the incidence of PCa in Asian men is relatively low. Therefore, we evaluated the association between PV and PCa detection rates in men with PSAs measuring 10-50 ng ml(-1). Men who underwent a 13-core prostatic biopsy with PV documentation participated in the study. A multivariate stepwise regression was used to evaluate whether the PV at time of prostate biopsy could predict the risk of PCa. The rates of PCa among men in different PSA ranges, stratified by PV medians (<60 and ≥60 ml), were calculated. There were 261 men included in the final analysis. PV was the strongest predictor of PCa risk (odds ratio, 0.02; P<0.001) compared to other variables. The PCa rates in men with PVs measuring <60 and ≥60 ml in the 10-19.9 ng ml(-1) PSA group were 40.6% and 15.1%, respectively, while the rates for men with PSAs measuring 20-50 ng ml(-1) were 65.1% and 26.8%. PV is an independent predictor of PCa in men with PSA measuring 10-50 ng ml(-1).

Vitamin D use was associated with improved BMD in the lumbar spine and in the first year.  Introduction:   Decreased BMD is a common side effect of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), leading to increased risk of fractures. Although loss of BMD appears to be greatest within the first year of starting ADT, there are few long-term studies of change in BMD, and risk factors for bone loss are not well-characterized.  Methods:   Men aged 50+ with nonmetastatic prostate cancer starting continuous ADT were enrolled in a prospective longitudinal study. BMD was determined by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry at baseline and yearly for 3 years. Matched controls were men with prostate cancer not receiving ADT. Multivariable regression analysis examined predictors of BMD loss.  Results:   Eighty ADT users and 80 controls were enrolled (mean age 69 years); 52.5 % had osteopenia and 8.1 % had osteoporosis at baseline. After 1 year, in adjusted models, ADT was associated with significant losses in lumbar spine BMD compared to controls (-2.57 %, p = 0.006), with a trend towards greater declines at the total hip (p = 0.09). BMD changes in years 2 and 3 were much smaller and not statistically different from controls. Use of vitamin D but not calcium was associated with improved BMD in the lumbar spine in year 1 (+6.19 %, p < 0.001) with smaller nonsignificant increases at other sites (+0.86 % femoral neck, +0.86 % total hip, p > 0.10) primarily in the first year.  Conclusions:   Loss of BMD associated with ADT is greatest at the lumbar spine and in the first year.

Although the primary mechanism of action of these drugs is well understood, the signaling pathways that confer resistance to these agents in certain types of cancer remain poorly understood. In particular, the association of p53 with the mechanism(s) of taxane-mediated cell death is still controversial. In this study, we showed that p53 has a profound inhibitory effect on docetaxel (Doc)-induced apoptosis in prostate and colorectal cancer cells and that caspases play a critical role in this process. Doc induced prostate cancer cell apoptosis at high levels in p53-null PC3 cells, at intermediate levels in p53-mutant DU145 cells and at low levels in p53 wild-type LNCaP cells. While transient overexpression of p53 in PC3 cells suppressed Doc-induced apoptosis, knockdown of p53 in LNCaP cells increased apoptosis. This finding was further confirmed using an isogenic pair of colorectal cancer cell lines, HCT-116 p53-/- and p53+/+, indicating that p53 inhibits induction of apoptosis by Doc.

The scope of this study was to distinguish the infrared spectra of carcinoma from normal tissue and necrosis and to use the infrared spectra of carcinoma to determine the primary tumor of brain metastasis. Data processing follows procedures that have previously been developed for the analysis of Raman images of these samples and includes the unmixing algorithm N-FINDR, segmentation by k-means clustering, and classification by support vector machines (SVMs). Upon comparison with the subsequent hematoxylin and eosin stained tissue sections of training specimens, correct classification rates of the first level SVM were 98.8% for brain tissue, 98.4% for necrosis and 94.4% for carcinoma. The primary tumors were correctly predicted with an overall rate of 98.7% for FTIR images of the training dataset by a second level SVM. Finally, the two level discrimination models were applied to four independent specimens for validation. Although the classification rates are slightly reduced compared to the training specimens, the majority of the infrared spectra of the independent specimens were assigned to the correct primary tumor.

Its transcription activation domain consists of the two transcription activation units called Tau-1 and Tau- 5. Tau-5 interacts with p160 coactivators like the transcription intermediary factor 2 (TIF2), which in their turn recruit histone modifiers and chromatin-remodelling complexes. The mechanism of action of Tau-1, however, remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate that transcription intermediary factor 1β (TIF1β) can induce the activity of the AR up to five fold when tested in vitro. Although there is no evidence for direct interactions between TIF1β and AR, mutation studies show that the activity of TIF1β depends on the integrity of Tau-1 in AR on the one hand, and the so-called tripartite motif domain in TIF1β on the other. Surprisingly, the coactivation by TIF1β via Tau-1 seems additive rather than cooperative with the AR coactivation by TIF2. Some mutations naturally occurring in androgen-insensitivity syndrome patients that reside in Tau-1 seem to impair the TIF1β coactivation of the AR, indicating that TIF1β could also be relevant for the in vivo androgen response in humans. Moreover, since TIF1β is well expressed in prostate cancer cells, its functional interaction with androgen signalling could in the long run be a therapeutic target for this disease.""","""['N Van Tilborgh', 'L Spans', 'C Helsen', 'L Clinckemalie', 'V Dubois', 'E Lerut', 'S Boonen', 'D Vanderschueren', 'F Claessens']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Endocrinol Invest""","""['Human androgen receptor mutation disrupts ternary interactions between ligand, receptor domains, and the coactivator TIF2 (transcription intermediary factor 2).', 'Interaction of beta-catenin and TIF2/GRIP1 in transcriptional activation by the androgen receptor.', 'Androgens modulate expression of transcription intermediary factor 2, an androgen receptor coactivator whose expression level correlates with early biochemical recurrence in prostate cancer.', 'Structural features discriminate androgen receptor N/C terminal and coactivator interactions.', 'Expression and function of androgen receptor coactivators in prostate cancer.', 'TRIM28 promotes luminal cell plasticity in a mouse model of prostate cancer.', 'TRIMming Down Hormone-Driven Cancers: The Biological Impact of TRIM Proteins on Tumor Development, Progression and Prognostication.', 'TRIM28 protects TRIM24 from SPOP-mediated degradation and promotes prostate cancer progression.', 'TRIM28 is overexpressed in glioma and associated with tumor progression.', 'Endogenous androgen receptor proteomic profiling reveals genomic subcomplex involved in prostate tumorigenesis.']"""

Aspirin use correlated with a clinically significant 4.7-point lower bowel summary score (95% CI 9.0-0.4, P=.03) and an increase in small, moderate, or big problems with bloody stools (2.8-fold; 95% CI 1.2-6.4, P=.018). Intensity modulated radiation therapy was associated with higher radiation therapy doses to the prostate and lower doses to the rectum but did not independently correlate with bowel HRQOL.  Conclusion:   After contemporary dose-escalated external beam radiation therapy up to 11% of patients have newly identified moderate/big problems with bowel HRQOL 2 years after treatment. Bowel HRQOL is related to baseline function, rectal V70, and aspirin use. Finally, our findings validate the commonly utilized cut-point of rectal V70 ≥25% as having significant impact on patient-reported outcomes.""","""['Daniel A Hamstra', 'Anna S C Conlon', 'Stephanie Daignault', 'Rodney L Dunn', 'Howard M Sandler', 'A Larry Hembroff', 'Anthony L Zietman', 'Irving Kaplan', 'Jay Ciezki', 'Deborah A Kuban', 'John T Wei', 'Martin G Sanda', 'Jeff M Michalski;PROSTQA Consortium Study Group']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Multinational Prospective Study of Patient-Reported Outcomes After Prostate Radiation Therapy: Detailed Assessment of Rectal Bleeding.', 'Dose to the inferior rectum is strongly associated with patient reported bowel quality of life after radiation therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Quality of life after whole pelvic versus prostate-only external beam radiotherapy for prostate cancer: a matched-pair comparison.', 'Dose-volume analysis of predictors for chronic rectal toxicity after treatment of prostate cancer with adaptive image-guided radiotherapy.', 'Quality of life study in prostate cancer patients treated with three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy: comparing late bowel and bladder quality of life symptoms to that of the normal population.', 'Patient reported outcomes for quality of life (QOL) by Expanded Prostate Cancer Index (EPIC) on average 15 years post treatment.', 'Feasibility of Same-Day Prostate Fiducial Markers, Perirectal Hydrogel Spacer Placement, and Computed Tomography and Magnetic Resonance Imaging Simulation for External Beam Radiation Therapy for Low-Risk and Intermediate-Risk Prostate Cancer.', ""Impact of Gastrointestinal Side Effects on Patients' Reported Quality of Life Trajectories after Radiotherapy for Prostate Cancer: Data from the Prospective, Observational Pros-IT CNR Study."", 'Inter-institutional analysis demonstrates the importance of lower than previously anticipated dose regions to prevent late rectal bleeding following prostate radiotherapy.', 'Implementing patient-reported outcome surveys as part of routine care: lessons from an academic radiation oncology department.']"""

Methods and materials:   A retrospective analysis of 575 patients treated with SRT after RP from a single institution. Of those, 250 patients experienced biochemical failure (BF), with the IBF defined as the time from commencement of SRT to BF. The IBF was evaluated by Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards models for its association with DM, PCSM, and OM.  Results:   The median follow-up time was 85 (interquartile range [IQR] 49.8-121.1) months, with a median IBF of 16.8 (IQR, 8.5-37.1) months. With a cutoff time of 18 months, as previously used, 129 (52%) of patients had IBF ≤18 months. There were no differences among any clinical or pathologic features between those with IBF ≤ and those with IBF >18 months. On log-rank analysis, IBF ≤18 months was prognostic for increased DM (P<.0001, HR 4.9, 95% CI 3.2-7.4), PCSM (P<.0001, HR 4.1, 95% CI 2.4-7.1), and OM (P<.0001, HR 2.7, 95% CI 1.7-4.1). Cox proportional hazards models with adjustment for other clinical variables demonstrated that IBF was independently prognostic for DM (P<.001, HR 4.9), PCSM (P<.0001, HR 4.0), and OM (P<.0001, HR 2.7). IBF showed minimal change in performance regardless of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) use.  Conclusion:   After SRT, a short IBF can be used for early identification of patients who are most likely to experience progression to DM, PCSM, and OM. IBF ≤18 months may be useful in clinical practice or as an endpoint for clinical trials.""","""['Skyler Johnson', 'William Jackson', 'Darren Li', 'Yeohan Song', 'Corey Foster', 'Ben Foster', 'Jessica Zhou', 'Jeffrey Vainshtein', 'Felix Feng', 'Daniel Hamstra']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Less advanced disease at initiation of salvage androgen deprivation therapy is associated with decreased mortality following biochemical failure post-salvage radiation therapy.', 'Interval to biochemical failure predicts clinical outcomes in patients with high-risk prostate cancer treated by combined-modality radiation therapy.', 'Larger maximum tumor diameter at radical prostatectomy is associated with increased biochemical failure, metastasis, and death from prostate cancer after salvage radiation for prostate cancer.', 'Interval to biochemical failure highly prognostic for distant metastasis and prostate cancer-specific mortality after radiotherapy.', 'Continued benefit to androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer patients treated with dose-escalated radiation therapy across multiple definitions of high-risk disease.', 'Markers of Toxicity and Response to Radiation Therapy in Patients With Prostate Cancer.', 'Time Interval to Biochemical Failure as a Surrogate End Point in Locally Advanced Prostate Cancer: Analysis of Randomized Trial NRG/RTOG 9202.', 'Less advanced disease at initiation of salvage androgen deprivation therapy is associated with decreased mortality following biochemical failure post-salvage radiation therapy.']"""

We aimed to determine whether frozen section analysis during radical prostatectomy reduces the incidence of positive surgical margins. We retrospectively analyzed a consecutive series of patients undergoing robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy performed at our institution between 2004 and 2011. We identified 2608 cases, including 1128 (43.3%) where intraoperative frozen section analysis was performed to assess surgical margins. Of the cases with positive (n = 60; 5.3%)/negative (n = 1029; 91.2%)/atypical or indeterminate (n = 39; 3.5%) frozen section analyses, 22 (36.7%)/83 (8.1%)/4 (10.3%) were found to have positive surgical margins on radical prostatectomy specimens, respectively. Thus, 109 (9.7%) of 1128 cases with frozen section analysis had positive surgical margins, compared with 163 (11.0%) of 1480 cases with no frozen section analysis (P = .264). When the patients were subgrouped by histopathologic characteristics, frozen section analysis led to a considerable reduction in the rate of positive surgical margins in cases with biopsy Gleason score 7 (12.4% → 8.7%; P = .087)/8 (28.6% → 16.3%; P = .048)/≥7 (15.3% → 10.1%; P = .012) tumor or pT3b (36.6% → 23.2%; P = .075)/≥pT3b (38.1% → 25.4%; P = .091) disease. Multivariate analysis further revealed that performing frozen section analysis in biopsy Gleason score 7 or higher tumors was an independent predictor of negative surgical margins (odds ratio, 0.61; P = .018). In addition, frozen section analysis of the distal urethra or apex of the prostate (7.5%, P = .035) as well as multiple negative frozen section analyses (≥2: 6.2%, P = .001; ≥4: 2.2%, P = .007) correlated with significantly lower rates of positive surgical margin, compared with no frozen section analysis. Overall, intraoperative frozen section analysis did not dramatically change surgical margin status of radical prostatectomy. Nonetheless, it could be useful in preventing incomplete tumor resection, especially in men with high-grade (Gleason score ≥7) tumor at the apex.""","""['Yasuhiro Kakiuchi', 'Bonnie Choy', 'Jennifer Gordetsky', 'Koji Izumi', 'Guan Wu', 'Hani Rashid', 'Jean V Joseph', 'Hiroshi Miyamoto']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Hum Pathol""","""['A comparison of the incidence and location of positive surgical margins in robotic assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy and open retropubic radical prostatectomy.', 'Intraoperative frozen section of the prostate decreases positive margin rate while ensuring nerve sparing procedure during radical prostatectomy.', 'Neurovascular structure-adjacent frozen-section examination (NeuroSAFE) increases nerve-sparing frequency and reduces positive surgical margins in open and robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy: experience after 11,069 consecutive patients.', 'Margin control in robotic and laparoscopic prostatectomy: what are the REAL outcomes?', 'Positive surgical margins after radical prostatectomy: a systematic review and contemporary update.', 'Practice Patterns of Korean Urologists Regarding Positive Surgical Margins after Radical Prostatectomy: a Survey and Narrative Review.', 'Novel imaging techniques for intraoperative margin assessment in surgical oncology: A systematic review.', 'The value of transperineal apical prostate biopsy in predicting urethral/apical margin status after radical prostatectomy.', 'NeuroSAFE robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy versus standard robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy for men with localised prostate cancer (NeuroSAFE PROOF): protocol for a randomised controlled feasibility study.', 'The Impact of Routine Frozen Section Assessment During Penectomy on Surgical Margin Status and Long-Term Oncologic Outcomes.']"""

The propensity of metastatic prostate cancer to spread to the bone has limited repeated sampling of tumor deposits. Hence, considerably less is understood about this lethal metastatic disease, as it is not commonly studied. Here we explored whole-genome sequencing of plasma DNA to scan the tumor genomes of these patients non-invasively.  Methods:   We wanted to make whole-genome analysis from plasma DNA amenable to clinical routine applications and developed an approach based on a benchtop high-throughput platform, that is, Illuminas MiSeq instrument. We performed whole-genome sequencing from plasma at a shallow sequencing depth to establish a genome-wide copy number profile of the tumor at low costs within 2 days. In parallel, we sequenced a panel of 55 high-interest genes and 38 introns with frequent fusion breakpoints such as the TMPRSS2-ERG fusion with high coverage. After intensive testing of our approach with samples from 25 individuals without cancer we analyzed 13 plasma samples derived from five patients with castration resistant (CRPC) and four patients with castration sensitive prostate cancer (CSPC).  Results:   The genome-wide profiling in the plasma of our patients revealed multiple copy number aberrations including those previously reported in prostate tumors, such as losses in 8p and gains in 8q. High-level copy number gains in the AR locus were observed in patients with CRPC but not with CSPC disease. We identified the TMPRSS2-ERG rearrangement associated 3-Mbp deletion on chromosome 21 and found corresponding fusion plasma fragments in these cases. In an index case multiregional sequencing of the primary tumor identified different copy number changes in each sector, suggesting multifocal disease. Our plasma analyses of this index case, performed 13 years after resection of the primary tumor, revealed novel chromosomal rearrangements, which were stable in serial plasma analyses over a 9-month period, which is consistent with the presence of one metastatic clone.  Conclusions:   The genomic landscape of prostate cancer can be established by non-invasive means from plasma DNA. Our approach provides specific genomic signatures within 2 days which may therefore serve as 'liquid biopsy'.""","""['Ellen Heitzer', 'Peter Ulz', 'Jelena Belic', 'Stefan Gutschi', 'Franz Quehenberger', 'Katja Fischereder', 'Theresa Benezeder', 'Martina Auer', 'Carina Pischler', 'Sebastian Mannweiler', 'Martin Pichler', 'Florian Eisner', 'Martin Haeusler', 'Sabine Riethdorf', 'Klaus Pantel', 'Hellmut Samonigg', 'Gerald Hoefler', 'Herbert Augustin', 'Jochen B Geigl', 'Michael R Speicher']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Genome Med""","""['A three-marker FISH panel detects more genetic aberrations of AR, PTEN and TMPRSS2/ERG in castration-resistant or metastatic prostate cancers than in primary prostate tumors.', 'Isolation and genomic analysis of circulating tumor cells from castration resistant metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Abnormal plasma DNA profiles in early ovarian cancer using a non-invasive prenatal testing platform: implications for cancer screening.', 'Using circulating cell-free DNA to monitor personalized cancer therapy.', 'The prognostic and predictive value of TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion and ERG protein expression in prostate cancer biopsies.', 'Circulating tumour DNA alterations: emerging biomarker in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.', 'Tumor-agnostic ctDNA levels by mFAST-SeqS in first-line HR-positive, HER2 negative metastatic breast cancer patients as a biomarker for survival.', 'Comparison of tumor-informed and tumor-naïve sequencing assays for ctDNA detection in breast cancer.', 'Dynamics of Sequence and Structural Cell-Free DNA Landscapes in Small-Cell Lung Cancer.', 'Circulating and urinary tumour DNA in urothelial carcinoma\xa0- upper tract, lower tract and metastatic disease.']"""

The hospitals were excluded from the count if brachytherapy was begun in a hospital within the given year, and thus was only available for part of the year. In 2004, 269 patients were treated by brachytherapy at only two hospitals. However, the numbers increased rapidly. A total of 1412 patients were treated at 23 hospitals in 2005, 2783 patients were treated at 83 hospitals in 2008, and 3793 patients were treated at 109 hospitals in 2011.

Material and methods:   We retrospectively analyzed 464 prostate cancer patients who underwent multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging before radical prostatectomy between 2006 and 2012. All the patients had clinically localized prostate cancer with Gleason score ≤6 and prostate-specific antigen ≤10 ng/ml. Of these patients, 238 were eligible for active surveillance (group A) and 226 were not. We divided these 226 patients into two groups according to the result of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging: 59 (26.1%) patients without visible tumor (group B) and 167 (73.9%) patients with visible tumor (group C). We evaluated the pathologic outcomes of organ-confined Gleason ≤6 disease and unfavorable disease in each group.  Results:   The proportions of organ-confined Gleason ≤6 disease and unfavorable disease were 63.9 and 11.3% in group A, 59.3 and 10.2% in group B, and 38.9 and 22.8% in Group C. Comparing group A and B, these proportions were not statistically different (P = 0.549 and P = 1.000, respectively). However, comparing group A and C, those were significantly different (P < 0.001 and P = 0.002, respectively). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, no visible tumor on multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging was an independent predictor of organ-confined Gleason score 6 disease (odds ratio 0.426, P = 0.007) but there was no statistically independent predictor for unfavorable disease.  Conclusions:   The tumor visibility on multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging could be a predictor of favorable disease for the prostate cancer patients who did not meet active surveillance criteria.

While this therapy is initially effective, nearly all PCs become refractory to it. As hormone receptors play a crucial role in this process, we constructed a tissue microarray consisting of PC samples from 107 hormone-naïve (HN) and 101 castration-resistant (CR) PC patients and analyzed the androgen receptor (AR) gene copy number and the protein expression profiles of AR, Serin210-phosphorylated AR (pAR(210)), estrogen receptor (ER)β, ERα and the proliferation marker Ki67. The amplification of the AR gene was virtually restricted to CR PC and was significantly associated with increased AR protein expression (P<0.0001) and higher tumor cell proliferation (P=0.001). Strong AR expression was observed in a subgroup of HN PC patients with an adverse prognosis. In contrast, the absence of AR expression in CR PC was significantly associated with a poor overall survival. While pAR(210) was predominantly found in CR PC patients (P<0.0001), pAR(210) positivity was observed in a subgroup of HN PC patients with a poor survival (P<0.05). Epithelial ERα expression was restricted to CR PC cells (9%). ERβ protein expression was found in 38% of both HN and CR PCs, but was elevated in matched CR PC specimens. Similar to pAR(210), the presence of ERβ in HN patients was significantly associated with an adverse prognosis (P<0.005). Our results strongly suggest a major role for pAR(210) and ERβ in HN PC.

In the search for new PCa biomarkers, analysis of the proportions of different groups of glycoforms of PSA is promising. Peaks of PSA, called isoforms and containing one or several glycoforms of the glycoprotein, can be separated by CE. For those samples in which PSA concentration is very low, a very sensitive detection technique, such as LIF, would be required. However, CE separation of fluorescently labeled isoforms of glycoproteins is challenging. In this work, three different methods of fluorescent derivatization of PSA were assayed with the aim of finding conditions allowing labeling of the glycoprotein compatible with CE resolution of its isoforms. NanoOrange, as a noncovalent label; 5-(iodoacetamide) fluorescein and BODIPY® FL C1 -IA, as covalent tags of thiol groups; and Chromeo™ P503, as a covalent tag of amino groups, were tried. Only the derivatization with the P503 fluorogenic dye led to the resolution by CE-LIF of several isoforms of labeled PSA.

Although 2-ME has been shown to activate c-Jun-NH2-kinase (JNK) and mitochondrial-dependent apoptotic signaling pathways, the underlying mechanisms, including downstream effectors, remain unclear. Here, we report that the human Bcl-2 homology 3 (BH3)-only protein harakiri (Hrk) is a critical effector of 2-ME-induced JNK/mitochondria-dependent apoptosis in prostate cancer cells. Hrk mRNA and protein are preferentially upregulated by 2-ME, and Hrk induction is dependent on the JNK activation of c-Jun. Hrk knockdown prevents 2-ME-mediated apoptosis by attenuating the decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential, subsequent cytochrome c (cyt c) release, and caspase activation. Involvement of the proapoptotic protein Bak in this process suggested the possible interaction between Hrk and Bak. Thus, Hrk activation by 2-ME or its overexpression displaced Bak from the complex with antiapoptotic protein Bcl-xL, whereas deletion of the Hrk BH3 domain abolished its interaction with Bcl-xL, reducing the proapoptotic function of Hrk. Finally, Hrk is also involved in the 2-ME-mediated reduction of X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis through Bak activation in prostate cancer cells. Together, our findings suggest that induction of the BH3-only protein Hrk is a critical step in 2-ME activation of the JNK-induced apoptotic pathway, targeting mitochondria by liberating proapoptotic protein Bak.""","""['Inik Chang', 'Shahana Majid', 'Sharanjot Saini', 'Mohd S Zaman', 'Soichiro Yamamura', 'Takeshi Chiyomaru', 'Varahram Shahryari', 'Shinichiro Fukuhara', 'Guoren Deng', 'Rajvir Dahiya', 'Yuichiro Tanaka']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Ther""","""['2-Methoxyestradiol-induced apoptosis in prostate cancer cells requires Smad7.', 'Roles of p38- and c-jun NH2-terminal kinase-mediated pathways in 2-methoxyestradiol-induced p53 induction and apoptosis.', 'Up-regulation of Bak and Bim via JNK downstream pathway in the response to nitric oxide in human glioblastoma cells.', 'The role of HRK gene in human cancer.', 'BCL-2 proteins and apoptosis: Recent insights and unknowns.', 'HRK inhibits colorectal cancer cells proliferation by suppressing the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway.', '2-Methoxyestradiol Damages DNA in Glioblastoma Cells by Regulating nNOS and Heat Shock Proteins.', 'The pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member Harakiri (HRK) induces cell death in glioblastoma multiforme.', '2-Methoxyestradiol Reverses the Pro-Carcinogenic Effect of L-Lactate in Osteosarcoma 143B Cells.', 'Effect of 2-methoxyestradiol on SK-LMS-1 uterine leiomyosarcoma cells.']"""

Despite its success, the duration of response is often limited. For previous antiandrogens, one mechanism of resistance is mutation of the androgen receptor (AR). To prospectively identify AR mutations that might confer resistance to enzalutamide, we performed a reporter-based mutagenesis screen and identified a novel mutation, F876L, which converted enzalutamide into an AR agonist. Ectopic expression of AR F876L rescued the growth inhibition of enzalutamide treatment. Molecular dynamics simulations performed on antiandrogen-AR complexes suggested a mechanism by which the F876L substitution alleviates antagonism through repositioning of the coactivator recruiting helix 12. This model then provided the rationale for a focused chemical screen which, based on existing antiandrogen scaffolds, identified three novel compounds that effectively antagonized AR F876L (and AR WT) to suppress the growth of prostate cancer cells resistant to enzalutamide.

Sulfotransferase 2B1b (SULT2B1b) (in short, SULT2B) is a prostate-expressed hydroxysteroid SULT that converts cholesterol, oxysterols, and DHEA to 3β-sulfates. DHEA metabolism involving sulfonation by SULT2B can potentially interfere with intraprostate androgen synthesis due to reduction of free DHEA pool and, thus, conversion of DHEA to androstenedione. Here we report that in prostatectomy specimens from treatment-naive patients, SULT2B expression is markedly reduced in malignant tissue (P < .001, Mann-Whitney U test) compared with robust expression in adjacent nonmalignant glands. SULT2B was detected in formalin-fixed specimens by immunohistochemistry on individual sections and tissue array. Immunoblotting of protein lysates of frozen cancer and matched benign tissue confirmed immunohistochemistry results. An in-house-developed rabbit polyclonal antibody against full-length human SULT2B was validated for specificity and used in the analyses. Ligand-activated vitamin D receptor induced the SULT2B1 promoter in vivo in mouse prostate and increased SULT2B mRNA and protein levels in vitro in prostate cancer cells. A vitamin D receptor/retinoid X receptor-α-bound DNA element (with a DR7 motif) mediated induction of the transfected SULT2B1 promoter in calcitriol-treated cells. SULT2B knockdown caused an increased proliferation rate of prostate cancer cells upon stimulation by DHEA.

The overall quality of each plan was compared using a virtual dose-escalation study. For US plans, rectal mean dose was inversely correlated with anterior score, but for PBS plans there was no association between rectal mean dose and anterior score. For both US and PBS plans, full bladder and empty bladder mean doses were correlated with anterior scores. For both US and PBS plans, femoral head mean doses were inversely correlated with anterior score. For US plans and a full bladder, 4 beam arrangements that included an anterior beam tied for the highest maximum prescription dose (MPD).

The expression level of the TMPRSS2-ERG gene was studied in various histological grades of prostate cancer and castration-resistant prostate cancer (CPRC).  Patients and methods:   GeneChip Affymetrix exon 1.0 ST arrays were used for expression profiling of ERG, erythroblast transformation-specific (ETS) variant gene 1 (ETV1), ETV4 and ETV5 genes in 67 prostate cancer tissue specimens. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis and in some cases DNA sequencing was used to validate the presence and the expression levels of TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusions.  Results:   In our series of patients with prostate cancer over expression of the ERG gene predicted the presence of TMPRSS2-ERG rearrangements in almost all cases. ETS expression by itself outmatched the diagnostic performance of the ERG exons ratioing allowing equal detection of the less frequent ETS gene fusion transcripts. The gene fusions were expressed at significantly lower levels in CPRC but occurred more frequently than in primary prostate cancer.  Conclusions:   ERG expression analysis using GeneChip arrays appears to be an excellent diagnostic tool for identifying gene rearrangements.

Methods:   We considered for this study all 371 prostate cancer patients recorded at the Geneva Cancer Registry diagnosed from 2004 to 2006 who underwent a radical prostatectomy. We used the kappa statistic to evaluate the Gleason score concordance from biopsy and prostatectomy specimens. Logistic regression was used to determine the parameters that predict the undergrading of the Gleason score in prostate biopsies.  Results:   The kappa statistic between biopsy and prostatectomy Gleason score was 0.42 (p < 0.0001), with 67% of patients exactly matched, and 26% (n = 95) patients with Gleason score underestimated by the biopsy. In a multi-adjusted model, increasing age, advanced clinical stage, having less than ten biopsy cores, and longer delay between the two procedures, were all independently associated with biopsy undergrading. In particular, the proportion of exact match increased to 72% when the patients had ten or more needle biopsy cores. The main limitation of the study is that both biopsy and prostatectomy specimens were examined by different laboratories.

The aim was to identify and quantify differences in the segmentation of target volumes and organs at risk (OARs) and to analyse the treatment plans and dose distributions.  Materials and methods:   Four patient cases were selected: Wilm's tumour, Hodgkin's disease, rhabdomyosarcoma of the prostate and chordoma of the skull base. The five participating centres received the same patient-related material. They introduced the cases in their treatment planning system, delineated target volumes and OARs and created treatment plans. Dose-volume histograms were retrieved for relevant structures and volumes and dose metrics were derived and compared, e.g. target volumes and their concordance, dose homogeneity index (HI), treated and irradiated volumes, remaining volume at risk and relevant Vx and Dx values.  Results:   We found significant differences in target segmentation in the majority of the cases. The planning target volumes (PTVs) varied two- to four-fold and conformity indices were in the range of 0.3-0.6. This resulted in large variations in dose distributions to OARs as well as in treated and irradiated volumes even though the treatment plans showed good conformity to the PTVs. Potential reasons for the differences in target delineation were analysed.  Conclusion:   Considerations of the growing child and difficulties in interpretation of the radiotherapy information in the treatment protocols were identified as reasons for the variation. As a result, clarified translated detailed radiotherapy guidelines for paediatric/adolescent patients have been recognised as a way to reduce this variation.""","""['Ingrid Kristensen', 'Måns Agrup', 'Per Bergström', 'Jacob Engellau', 'Hedda Haugen', 'Ulla Martinsson', 'Kristina Nilsson', 'Zahra Taheri-Kadkhoda', 'Jack Lindh', 'Per Nilsson']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Acta Oncol""","""['On the performances of different IMRT Treatment Planning Systems for selected paediatric cases.', 'Comparative treatment planning on localized prostate carcinoma conformal photon- versus proton-based radiotherapy.', 'A treatment planning comparison of combined photon-proton beams versus proton beams-only for the treatment of skull base tumors.', 'Review of skull base chordomas: prognostic factors and long-term results of proton-beam radiotherapy.', 'The SIOP-Renal Tumour Study Group consensus statement on flank target volume delineation for highly conformal radiotherapy.', 'Resection cavity auto-contouring for patients with pediatric medulloblastoma using only CT information.', 'A dose based approach for evaluation of inter-observer variations in target delineation.']"""

Although many studies indicate that the activation of NF-κB signaling appears to be correlated with advanced cancer and promotes tumor metastasis by influencing tumor cell migration and angiogenesis, the influence of altered NF-κB signaling in prostate cancer cells within boney metastatic lesions is not clearly understood. While C4-2B and PC3 prostate cancer cells grow well in the bone, LNCaP cells are difficult to grow in murine bone following intraskeletal injection. Our studies show that when compared to LNCaP, NF-κB activity is significantly higher in C4-2B and PC3, and that the activation of NF-κB signaling in prostate cancer cells resulted in the increased expression of the osteoclast inducing genes PTHrP and RANKL. Further, conditioned medium derived from NF-κB activated LNCaP cells induce osteoclast differentiation. In addition, inactivation of NF-κB signaling in prostate cancer cells inhibited tumor formation in the bone, both in the osteolytic PC3 and osteoblastic/osteoclastic mixed C4-2B cells; while the activation of NF-κB signaling in LNCaP cells promoted tumor establishment and proliferation in the bone. The activation of NF-κB in LNCaP cells resulted in the formation of an osteoblastic/osteoclastic mixed tumor with increased osteoclasts surrounding the new formed bone, similar to metastases commonly seen in patients with prostate cancer. These results indicate that osteoclastic reaction is required even in the osteoblastic cancer cells and the activation of NF-κB signaling in prostate cancer cells increases osteoclastogenesis by up-regulating osteoclastogenic genes, thereby contributing to bone metastatic formation.""","""['Renjie Jin', 'Julie A Sterling', 'James R Edwards', 'David J DeGraff', 'Changki Lee', 'Serk In Park', 'Robert J Matusik']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['CCN3 promotes prostate cancer bone metastasis by modulating the tumor-bone microenvironment through RANKL-dependent pathway.', 'RANKL acts directly on RANK-expressing prostate tumor cells and mediates migration and expression of tumor metastasis genes.', 'Therapeutic potential of curcumin in prostate cancer--V: Interference with the osteomimetic properties of hormone refractory C4-2B prostate cancer cells.', 'The role of osteoclastic activity in prostate cancer skeletal metastases.', 'Prostate cancer bone metastases promote both osteolytic and osteoblastic activity.', 'Antagonizing exosomal miR-18a-5p derived from prostate cancer cells ameliorates metastasis-induced osteoblastic lesions by targeting Hist1h2bc and activating Wnt/β-catenin pathway.', 'MAX: a simple, affordable, and rapid tissue clearing reagent for 3D imaging of wide variety of biological specimens.', ""Knockdown of USP8 inhibits prostate cancer cell growth, proliferation, and metastasis and promotes docetaxel's activity by suppressing the NF-kB signaling pathway."", 'Impact of STAT Proteins in Tumor Progress and Therapy Resistance in Advanced and Metastasized Prostate Cancer.', 'The Role of Inflammation in Breast and Prostate Cancer Metastasis to Bone.']"""

Recently, an indirect mechanism of androgen action in which effects of AR on CaP cells are mediated by Serum Response Factor (SRF) has been identified. This is the first mode of androgen action to be associated with aggressive CaP and disease recurrence. The manner in which androgen-responsive SRF activity controls aggressive CaP cell behavior is unknown. Here, the contribution of two representative SRF effector genes that are underexpressed, calponin 2 (CNN2), or overexpressed, sidekick-homolog 1 (SDK1), in clinical CaP specimens is studied. AR- and SRF- dependency of CNN2 and SDK1 expression was verified using synthetic and natural androgens, antiandrogens, and small interfering RNAs targeting AR or SRF, and evaluating the kinetics of androgen induction and SRF binding to endogenously and exogenously expressed regulatory gene regions in AR-positive CaP model systems that mimic the transition from androgen-stimulated to castration-recurrent disease. Small interfering RNA-mediated deregulation of CNN2 or SDK1 expression did not affect CaP cell proliferation or apoptosis but had marked effects on CaP cell morphology and actin cytoskeleton organization. Loss of CNN2 induced cellular protrusions and increased CaP cell migration, whereas silencing of SDK1 led to cell rounding and blunted CaP cell migration. Changes in cell migration did not involve epithelial-mesenchymal transition but correlated with altered β1-integrin expression. Taken together, individual androgen-responsive SRF target genes affect CaP cell behavior by modulating cell migration, which may have implications for therapeutic intervention downstream of AR and SRF.""","""['Alissa R Verone', 'Kelly Duncan', 'Alejandro Godoy', 'Neelu Yadav', 'Andrei Bakin', 'Shahriar Koochekpour', 'Jian-Ping Jin', 'Hannelore V Heemers']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Carcinogenesis""","""['Protein Kinase N1 control of androgen-responsive serum response factor action provides rationale for novel prostate cancer treatment strategy.', 'Identification of a RhoA- and SRF-dependent mechanism of androgen action that is associated with prostate cancer progression.', 'RhoA as a mediator of clinically relevant androgen action in prostate cancer cells.', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'The role of intracrine androgen metabolism, androgen receptor and apoptosis in the survival and recurrence of prostate cancer during androgen deprivation therapy.', 'Potential prognostic and immunotherapeutic value of calponin 1: A pan-cancer analysis.', 'Ectopic expression of CNN2 of colon cancer promotes cell migration.', 'Identification of Novel MeCP2 Cancer-Associated Target Genes and Post-Translational Modifications.', 'Global Gene Expression Characterization of Circulating Tumor Cells in Metastasic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'Crucial role of serum response factor in renal tubular epithelial cell epithelial-mesenchymal transition in hyperuricemic nephropathy.']"""

Prostate cancer risk was positively associated with %PPL saturated fatty acids (SFAs); HR [95% CI] = 1.51 [1.06, 2.16] (Q5 vs. Q1, fifth vs. first quintile); p-trend = 0.003. HRs (Q5 to Q2 vs. Q1) were significantly elevated for %PPL palmitic acid. %PPL oleic acid was inversely associated with risk, HR = 0.62 [0.43, 0.91] (Q5 vs. Q1); p-trend = 0.04. No statistically significant linear trends were observed for dietary intakes. The HRs were elevated for moderate intakes of linoleic acid (Q2 and Q3 vs. Q1, 1.58 [1.10, 2.28] and 1.70 [1.18, 2.46], respectively), but the increase was not significant for higher intakes (Q4 and Q5). No association varied significantly by tumour aggressiveness (all p-homogeneity > 0.1). Prostate cancer risk was positively associated with %PPL SFA, largely attributable to palmitic acid and inversely associated with %PPL monounsaturated fatty acids, largely attributable to oleic acid. Higher risks were also observed for dietary n-6 polyunsaturated fats, primarily linoleic acid.""","""['Julie K Bassett', 'Gianluca Severi', 'Allison M Hodge', 'Robert J MacInnis', 'Robert A Gibson', 'John L Hopper', 'Dallas R English', 'Graham G Giles']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Int J Cancer""","""['Plasma phospholipids fatty acids, dietary fatty acids, and breast cancer risk.', 'Dietary and biomarker estimates of fatty acids and risk of colorectal cancer.', 'Associations of whole-blood fatty acids and dietary intakes with prostate cancer in Jamaica.', 'Dietary fatty acids and colorectal and prostate cancers: epidemiological studies.', 'Dietary fatty acids and experimental carcinogenesis.', 'Serum Saturated Fatty Acids including Very Long-Chain Saturated Fatty Acids and Colorectal Cancer Risk among Chinese Population.', 'Association Between Dietary Fatty Acid Pattern and Risk of Oral Cancer.', 'N-6 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids and Risk of Cancer: Accumulating Evidence from Prospective Studies.', 'Effect of Palmitic Acid on Exosome-Mediated Secretion and Invasive Motility in Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Dietary Fat and Cancer-Which Is Good, Which Is Bad, and the Body of Evidence.']"""

However, patient responses are variable, and survival benefit remains relatively small. Developing effective modality to improve MDV3100 efficacy is urgently needed. Recent evidence suggests that constitutively active androgen receptor splice variants (AR-Vs) drive resistance to MDV3100. In our study, we show that methylselenol prodrug downregulates the expression and activity of both the full-length AR (AR-FL) and AR-Vs. The downregulation is independent of androgen and could be attributable to repressed transcription of the AR gene. Cotreatment with methylselenol prodrug and MDV3100 suppresses AR signaling more dramatically than either agent alone, and synergistically inhibits the growth of CRPC cells in vitro. The combinatorial efficacy is observed in not only AR-V-expressing cells but also cells expressing predominantly AR-FL, likely owing to the ability of the two drugs to block the AR signaling cascade at distinct steps. Ectopic expression of AR-FL or AR-V7 attenuates the combinatorial efficacy, indicating that downregulating AR-FL and AR-V7 is importantly involved in mediating the combinatorial efficacy. Significantly, methylselenol prodrug also downregulates AR-FL and AR-Vs in vivo and substantially improves the antitumor efficacy of MDV3100. These findings support a potential combination therapy for improving MDV3100 efficacy, and provide a rationale for evaluating the clinical application of combining methylselenol prodrug with MDV3100 for the treatment of CRPC.""","""['Yang Zhan', 'Bo Cao', 'Yanfeng Qi', 'Shuang Liu', 'Qi Zhang', 'Weidong Zhou', 'Duo Xu', 'Hua Lu', 'Oliver Sartor', 'Wei Kong', 'Haitao Zhang', 'Yan Dong']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Int J Cancer""","""['A novel antiandrogen, Compound 30, suppresses castration-resistant and MDV3100-resistant prostate cancer growth in vitro and in vivo.', 'Distinct transcriptional programs mediated by the ligand-dependent full-length androgen receptor and its splice variants in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Galectin-3 Is Implicated in Tumor Progression and Resistance to Anti-androgen Drug Through Regulation of Androgen Receptor Signaling in Prostate Cancer.', 'New hormonal therapies for castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Enzalutamide as a second generation antiandrogen for treatment of advanced prostate cancer.', 'Targeting INMT and interrupting its methylation pathway for the treatment of castration resistant prostate cancer.', 'Toxicology and pharmacology of synthetic organoselenium compounds: an update.', 'Mithramycin suppresses DNA damage repair via targeting androgen receptor in prostate cancer.', 'Role of GDF15 in methylseleninic acid-mediated inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis in prostate cancer cells.', 'Raddeanin A down-regulates androgen receptor and its splice variants in prostate cancer.']"""

Methods:   The medical records of a population-based sample of 777 North Carolina men with newly diagnosed prostate cancer were studied to assess the association among patient race, clinical factors, and National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guideline-concordant prostate cancer care.  Results:   African Americans presented with significantly higher Gleason scores (P = .025) and prostate-specific antigen levels (P = .008) than did Caucasian Americans. However, when clinical T stage was considered as well, difference in overall risk category only approached statistical significance (P = .055). Across risk categories, African Americans were less likely to have surgery (58.1% versus 68.0%, P = .004) and more likely to have radiation (39.0% versus 27.4%, P = .001) compared with Caucasian Americans. However, 83.5% of men received guideline-concordant care within 1 year of diagnosis, which did not differ by race in multivariable analysis (odds ratio = 0.83; 95% confidence interval = 0.54-1.25).

Here, we determine the therapeutic potential of eIF3b by examining the clinical relevance of its expression in human cancer tissues and its role in experimental tumor models.  Experimental design:   We examined mRNA expression of eIF3b in bladder (N = 317) and prostate (N = 566) tissue samples and protein expression by immunohistochemistry in 143 bladder tumor samples as a function of clinicopathologic features. The impact of eIF3b depletion by siRNA in human cancer lines was evaluated in regard to in vitro cell growth, cell cycle, migration, in vivo subcutaneous tumor growth, and lung colonization.  Results:   eIF3b mRNA expression correlated to tumor grade, stage, and survival in human bladder and prostate cancer. eIF3b protein expression stratified survival in human bladder cancer. eIF3b depletion reduced in vitro cancer cell growth; inhibited G1-S cell-cycle transition by changing protein but not RNA expression of cyclin A, E, Rb, and p27Kip1; inhibited migration; and disrupted actin cytoskeleton and focal adhesions. These changes were associated with decreased protein expression of integrin α5. Integrin α5 depletion phenocopied effects observed with eIF3b. eIF3b-depleted bladder cancer cells formed fewer subcutaneous tumors that grew more slowly and had reduced lung colonization.

Although this modified procedure attained the oracle properties, the resulting models tend to include a large number of ""false positives"" in practice. Here, we adapt the concept of local false discovery rates (lFDRs) so that it applies to the sequence, λn, of smoothing parameters for the adaptive Lasso. We define the lFDR for a given λn to be the probability that the variable added to the model by decreasing λn to λn-δ is not associated with the outcome, where δ is a small value. We derive the relationship between the lFDR and λn, show lFDR =1 for traditional smoothing parameters, and show how to select λn so as to achieve a desired lFDR.

Pooled plasma samples from patients with localized PCa or mCRPC (25 per group) were assayed using the Exiqon miRNA qPCR panel, and the differential expression of selected candidates was validated using qRT-PCR. We identified 63 miRNAs upregulated in mCRPC versus localized PCa, while only four were downregulated. Pearson's correlation analysis revealed two highly correlated groups: one consisting of miR-141, miR375 and miR-200c and the other including miR151-3p, miR423-3p, miR-126, miR152 and miR-21. A third group, containing miR-16 and miR-205, showed less correlation. One miRNA from each group (miR-141, miR151-3p and miR-16) was used for logistic regression analysis and proved to increase the sensitivity of the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test alone. While no miRNA alone differentiated localized PCa and mCRPC, combinations had greater sensitivity and specificity. The expression of these 10 candidates was assayed for association with clinical parameters of disease progression through the cBio portal.

The 3- and 5-year biochemical non-evidence of disease rates of all patients were 52.6% and 48.8%, respectively. The Gleason score (≥4 + 3, ≤3 + 4) and pre-intensity-modulated radiotherapy prostate-specific antigen level (≥0.5 ng/mL, <0.5 ng/mL) were significant predictive factors for biochemical non-evidence of disease in univariate analysis. In multivariate analysis, only the Gleason score was detected as a significant variable. The highest late genitourinary toxicities were grade 2 in 13% and grade 3 in 6% of patients. The highest late gastrointestinal toxicities were grade 2 in 6% and grade 3 in 3% of patients.  Conclusion:   Despite a relatively high radiation dose, intensity-modulated radiotherapy with an endorectal balloon can be delivered with acceptable toxicity and efficacy for patients developing biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy.""","""['Hiromichi Ishiyama', 'Bin S Teh', 'Angel I Blanco', 'Arnold C Paulino', 'Wei-Yuan Mai', 'James Caillouet', 'Bo Xu', 'E Brian Butler']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Int J Urol""","""['Editorial comment to salvage intensity modulated radiotherapy using endorectal balloon after radical prostatectomy: clinical outcomes.', 'High-dose salvage intensity-modulated radiotherapy with or without androgen deprivation after radical prostatectomy for rising or persisting prostate-specific antigen: 5-year results.', 'Salvage intensity-modulated radiotherapy for rising PSA after radical prostatectomy.', 'Salvage hypofractionated radiotherapy for biochemically recurrent prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy.', 'Adjuvant versus salvage radiotherapy following radical prostatectomy: do the AUA/ASTRO guidelines have all the answers?', 'Prostate cancer recurrence after radical prostatectomy and salvage radiotherapy.', 'The effects of PSA kinetics on the outcome of hypofractionated salvage radiotherapy for biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer after prostatectomy.', 'Post-Prostatectomy Image-Guided Radiotherapy: The Invisible Target Concept.', 'Rationale and development of image-guided intensity-modulated radiotherapy post-prostatectomy: the present standard of care?']"""

Androgen receptor (AR) activation was initially proposed as a vital signaling pathway in prostate cancer and consequent signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3)-AR complex led an important putative mechanism by which prostate cells are sensitized with growth factor signals. However, in SRC disease, no related study emerged.  Methods:   30 patients with SRC and 20 age-matched healthy controls were recruited. Puncture biopsy was performed to acquire cyst-adjacent kidney tissue and normal kidney tissues were from healthy kidney donor who received living-related donor nephrectomy. The expression of STAT3 and androgen receptor was determined by immunohistochemical staining and western blotting. The in-vitro effect of androgen on human HK-2 (an immortalized proximal tubule epithelial cell line from normal adult human kidney) cells' STAT3 expression was analyzed as well.  Results:   Activated STAT3 was strongly expressed in tubular epithelial cells from kidneys of SRC patients, while it was barely found in normal kidneys. Meanwhile, the androgen receptor positive cyst epithelial cells and adjacent normal renal tubule cells were observed in kidneys from SRC patients, however, AR was weakly expressed in normal healthy male kidneys, statistically significant differences existed. In-vitro experiment demonstrated that when treated with exogenous added androgen, the expression level of STAT3 in HK-2 cells was significantly elevated.  Conclusions:   Our data raised the possible novel evidence that androgen-STAT3 activation might contribute to gender disparity in human SRC disease and clarification the esoteric mechanisms will provide us attractive therapy target for cystic kidney disease.""","""['Min Liu', 'Yun-Fei Xu', 'Yuan Feng', 'Wei Zhai', 'Jian-Ping Che', 'Sheng-Qiang Xia', 'Guang-Chun Wang', 'Jun-Hua Zheng']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Int J Clin Exp Pathol""","""['Cyclic stretch-induced TGF-β1 and fibronectin expression is mediated by β1-integrin through c-Src- and STAT3-dependent pathways in renal epithelial cells.', 'Hepatitis B virus X protein modulates apoptosis in human renal proximal tubular epithelial cells by activating the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway.', 'Activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 correlates with cell proliferation and renal injury in human glomerulonephritis.', '1992 Homer Smith Award.

Recently, we and others have shown that URI/RMP is also important for progression of hepatocellular carcinoma, ovarian, and prostate cancers. To identify the mechanistic basis of URI/RMP during multiple cellular processes, we investigated URI/RMP expression in a tissue microarray (TMA) containing multiple normal human tissues. The results showed that URI/RMP is ubiquitously but differentially expressed in these human tissues which partially explains its multiple cellular functions. To elucidate the role of URI/RMP during oncogenesis of multiple malignancies, especially the tumors of reproductive system, we analyzed URI/RMP expression in a TMA containing multiple reproductive system tumors. We did not observe significant difference of URI/RMP expression between cancerous and adjacent tissues of the prostate, breast, ovarian, and endometrial cancers. However, increased URI/RMP expression was observed in two of the three cases of cervical SCC (squamous cell carcinoma) cells compared to their adjacent epithelial cells. Moreover, we detected significantly upregulated URI/RMP expression not only in cervical cancers but also in pre-cancerous CINs (cervical intra-epithelial neoplasias) in a TMA that covers the whole spectrum of normal cervix, CINs, and cervical cancers. No difference of URI/RMP expression was observed between CINs and cervical cancers. Given the high risk of CINs (especially CIN3) turning into cervical cancer if left untreated, the increased URI/RMP expression in CINs as well as in cervical cancers suggest a clinical relevance of URI/RMP upon cervical cancer tumorigenesis and worth further investigation.""","""['Junxia Gu', 'Xiaoyun Li', 'Yuting Liang', 'Longwei Qiao', 'Deyuan Ran', 'Yaojuan Lu', 'Xingang Li', 'Wenxiang Wei', 'Qiping Zheng']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Int J Clin Exp Pathol""","""['Expression analysis of URI/RMP gene in endometrioid adenocarcinoma by tissue microarray immunohistochemistry.', 'Altered expression of cellular membrane molecules of HLA-DR, HLA-G and CD99 in cervical intraepithelial neoplasias and invasive squamous cell carcinoma.', 'Nectin-1 expression in the normal and neoplastic human uterine cervix.', 'Enhanced expression of hedgehog signaling molecules in squamous cell carcinoma of uterine cervix and its precursor lesions.', 'The natural history of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia: an argument for intermediate endpoint biomarkers.', 'URI1 suppresses irradiation-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) by activating autophagy in hepatocellular carcinoma cells.', 'RPB5-mediating protein promotes the progression of non-small cell lung cancer by regulating the proliferation and invasion.', 'RMP promotes the proliferation and radioresistance of esophageal carcinoma.', 'The Expression of MicroRNA-598 Inhibits Ovarian Cancer Cell Proliferation and Metastasis by Targeting URI.', 'Values of miR-34a and miR-218 expression in the diagnosis of cervical cancer and the prediction of prognosis.']"""

Population isolates may have different sets of risk alleles for PrCa constituting unique population and individual risk profiles.  Methods:   To test this hypothesis, associations between 31 GWAS SNPs of PrCa were examined among 979 PrCa cases and 1,251 controls of Ashkenazic descent using logistic regression. We also investigated risks by age at diagnosis, pathological features of PrCa, and family history of cancer. Moreover, we examined associations between cumulative number of risk alleles and PrCa and assessed the utility of risk alleles in PrCa risk prediction by comparing the area under the curve (AUC) for different logistic models.  Results:   Of the 31 genotyped SNPs, 8 were associated with PrCa at p ≤ 0.002 (corrected p-value threshold) with odds ratios (ORs) ranging from 1.22 to 1.42 per risk allele. Four SNPs were associated with aggressive PrCa, while three other SNPs showed potential interactions for PrCa by family history of PrCa (rs8102476; 19q13), lung cancer (rs17021918; 4q22), and breast cancer (rs10896449; 11q13). Men in the highest vs. lowest quartile of cumulative number of risk alleles had ORs of 3.70 (95% CI 2.76-4.97); 3.76 (95% CI 2.57-5.50), and 5.20 (95% CI 2.94-9.19) for overall PrCa, aggressive cancer and younger age at diagnosis, respectively. The addition of cumulative risk alleles to the model containing age at diagnosis and family history of PrCa yielded a slightly higher AUC (0.69 vs. 0.64).  Conclusion:   These data define a set of risk alleles associated with PrCa in men of Ashkenazic descent and indicate possible genetic differences for PrCa between populations of European and Ashkenazic ancestry. Use of genetic markers might provide an opportunity to identify men at highest risk for younger age of onset PrCa; however, their clinical utility in identifying men at highest risk for aggressive cancer remains limited.""","""['Ilir Agalliu', 'Zhaoming Wang', 'Tao Wang', 'Anne Dunn', 'Hemang Parikh', 'Timothy Myers', 'Robert D Burk', 'Laufey Amundadottir']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Common genetic variants associated with disease from genome-wide association studies are mutually exclusive in prostate cancer and rheumatoid arthritis.', 'A genome-wide association study of prostate cancer in Latinos.', 'Validation of a prostate cancer polygenic risk score.', 'Genetic predisposition to prostate cancer.', 'A systematic review of replication studies of prostate cancer susceptibility genetic variants in high-risk men originally identified from genome-wide association studies.', 'Germline Variants in DNA Damage Repair Genes and HOXB13 Among Black Patients With Early-Onset Prostate Cancer.', 'Systematic identification of functionally relevant risk alleles to stratify aggressive versus indolent prostate cancer.', 'Risk Model for Prostate Cancer Using Environmental and Genetic Factors in the Spanish Multi-Case-Control (MCC) Study.', 'miRNA in Prostate Cancer: New Prospects for Old Challenges.', 'Genome-wide association studies and epigenome-wide association studies go together in cancer control.']"""

Methods:   The expression of miR-205 is measured by qRT-PCR and in situ hybridisation in a well-documented PCa cohort. An AGO2-based RIP-Chip assay is used to identify targets that are verified with western blots, luciferase reporter assay, ELISA and immunohistochemistry.  Results:   The expression of miR-205 is inversely correlated to the occurrence of metastases and shortened overall survival, and is lower in castration-resistant PCa patients. The miR-205 expression is mainly localised to the basal cells of benign prostate tissues. Genes regulated by miR-205 are enriched in, for example, the MAPK/ERK, Toll-like receptor and IL-6 signaling pathways. We demonstrate binding of miR-205 to the 3'UTR of androgen receptor (AR) and decrease of both AR transcript and protein levels. This finding was corroborated in the patient cohort were miR-205 expression inversely correlated to AR immunostaining in malignant prostate cells and to serum levels of prostate-specific antigen, an androgen-regulated protein.

First-line cisplatin and pemetrexed confers a survival benefit, with a median progression-free survival (PFS) of 5.7 months. Sorafenib inhibits tyrosine kinases, including receptors for vascular endothelial growth factor, which are implicated in mesothelioma pathogenesis by preclinical and clinical data.  Methods:   Sorafenib, at 400 mg twice daily, was assessed in a single-arm multicenter phase 2 study, using Simon's two-stage design. Eligible patients had received platinum combination chemotherapy earlier. The primary endpoint was PFS at 6 months, with secondary endpoints, including response rate and metabolic response, assessed using fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography. Published reference values for PFS in mesothelioma provide a benchmark for the null hypothesis of 28% progression-free at 6 months, and for moderate or significant clinical activity of 35% or 43% progression-free at 6 months, respectively.  Results:   Fifty-three patients (72%) were treated. Most had epithelioid histology. Ninety-three percent of patients had a performance status 0 or 1. Treatment was well tolerated with few grade 3 or 4 toxicities. Median PFS was 5.1 months, with 36% of patients being progression-free at 6 months. Nine percent of patients remained on study beyond 1 year. Changes in fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography parameters did not predict clinical outcome.  Conclusions:   Sorafenib is well tolerated in patients with mesothelioma after completion of platinum-containing chemotherapy.

High-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy as monotherapy is established to be a good treatment option for PC using extremely hypofractionated schemes. This hypofractionation can also be achieved with stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT). We report results on toxicity, PSA response, and quality of life (QOL) in patients treated with SBRT for favorable-risk PC.  Methods:   Over the last 4 years, 50 hormone-naïve patients with low- and intermediate-risk PC were treated with SBRT to a total dose of 38 Gy delivered in four daily fractions of 9.5 Gy. An integrated boost to 11 Gy per fraction was applied to the dominant lesion if visible on MRI. Toxicity and QoL was assessed prospectively using validated questionnaires.  Results:   Median follow-up was 23 months. The 2-year actuarial biochemical control rate was 100%. Median PSA nadir was 0.6 ng/ml. Median International Prostate Symptoms Score (IPSS) was 9/35 before treatment, with a median increase of 4 at 3 months and remaining stable at 13/35 thereafter. The EORTC/RTOG toxicity scales showed grade 2 and 3 gastrointestinal (GI) acute toxicity in 12% and 2%, respectively. The late grade 2 GI toxicity was 3% during 24 months FU. Genitourinary (GU) grade 2, 3 toxicity was seen in 15%, 8%, in the acute phase and 10%, 6% at 24 months, respectively. The urinary, bowel and sexual domains of the EORTC-PR25 scales recovered over time, showing no significant changes at 24 months post-treatment.  Conclusions:   SBRT to 38 Gy in 4 daily fractions for low- and intermediate-risk PC patients is feasible with low acute and late genitourinary and gastrointestinal toxicity.

Our previous studies demonstrated that in human prostate cancer the miRNA miR-125b is highly expressed, leading to a negative regulation of some tumor suppressor genes. In this study, we further extend our studies by showing that miR-125b represses the protein product of the ink4a/ARF locus, p14(ARF), in two prostate cancer cell lines, LNCaP (wild type-p53) and 22Rv1 (both wild type and mutant p53), as well as in the PC-346C prostate cancer xenograft model that lentivirally overexpressed miR-125b. Our results highlight that miR-125b modulates the p53 network by hindering the down-regulation of Mdm2, thereby affecting p53 and its target genes p21 and Puma to a degree sufficient to inhibit apoptosis. Conversely, treatment of prostate cancer cells with an inhibitor of miR-125b (anti-miR-125b) resulted in increased expression of p14(ARF), decreased level of Mdm2, and induction of apoptosis. In addition, overexpression of miR-125b in p53-deficient PC3 cells induced down-regulation of p14(ARF), which leads to increased cell proliferation through a p53-independent manner. Thus, we conclude that miR-125b acts as an oncogene which regulates p14(ARF)/Mdm2 signaling, stimulating proliferation of prostate cancer cells through a p53-dependent or p53-independent function.

Recruitment of inflammatory monocytes to the tumor site is mediated by C-C chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) through binding to its receptor CCR2. We hypothesized that androgen could modulate CCL2 expression in hormone-responsive prostate cancer cells and thereby promote recruitment of monocytes. Given the inhibitory effect of broccoli-derived compounds indole-3-carbinol (I3C) and 3,3'-diindolylmethane (DIM) on androgen-dependent pathways, we also reasoned that I3C and DIM could modulate the effect of androgen on CCL2-mediated pathways. Dihydrotestosterone was found to induce a time-dependent (0-72 hours) and concentration-dependent (0-1 nmol/L) increase in CCL2 mRNA levels in androgen-responsive human prostate cancer cells (LNCaP). This increase in CCL2 mRNA corresponded with increased secretion of CCL2 protein. The effect of dihydrotestosterone was mediated through an androgen receptor (AR)-dependent pathway as small inhibitor RNA against AR negated the induction of CCL2. Although dihydrotestosterone also induced TWIST1 mRNA, an epithelial-mesenchymal transition-related factor, and purported inducer of CCL2, blocking its expression with small inhibitor RNA did not inhibit dihydrotestosterone induction of CCL2 mRNA. Moreover, conditioned media from androgen-treated cells promoted human monocyte THP-1 cell migration and this effect was blocked by antibody against CCL-2. Both I3C and DIM inhibited promotional effects of dihydrotestosterone on CCL2 and migration. These results show that androgen may regulate CCL2 and promote inflammatory microenvironment in prostate tumors and that this process can be blocked by broccoli-derived compounds.""","""['Eun-Kyung Kim', 'Young S Kim', 'John A Milner', 'Thomas T Y Wang']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Cancer Prev Res (Phila)""","""[""Broccoli-derived phytochemicals indole-3-carbinol and 3,3'-diindolylmethane exerts concentration-dependent pleiotropic effects on prostate cancer cells: comparison with other cancer preventive phytochemicals."", 'Androgen receptor as a regulator of ZEB2 expression and its implications in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in prostate cancer.', 'Indole-3-carbinol inhibition of androgen receptor expression and downregulation of androgen responsiveness in human prostate cancer cells.', 'Multiple roles of chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 in promoting prostate cancer growth.', 'Molecular targets and anticancer potential of indole-3-carbinol and its derivatives.', 'Anti-cancer potential of synergistic phytochemical combinations is influenced by the genetic profile of prostate cancer cell lines.', 'Inhibition of Tumor Growth by Dietary Indole-3-Carbinol in a Prostate Cancer Xenograft Model May Be Associated with Disrupted Gut Microbial Interactions.', ""Elucidating the Role of CD84 and AHR in Modulation of LPS-Induced Cytokines Production by Cruciferous Vegetable-Derived Compounds Indole-3-Carbinol and 3,3'-Diindolylmethane."", 'Diallyl disulfide inhibits TNFα-induced CCL2 release by MDA-MB-231 cells.']"""

Our aim was to evaluate, whether iatrogenic impairment of the pelvic floor muscles after retropubic radical prostatectomy (RRP) causes detectable changes in fMRI in the early postoperative period. fMRI was performed at 3T in 22 patients before and after RRP with urge to void due to a filled bladder. In a non-voiding model they were instructed to contract or to relax the pelvic floor muscles repetitively. As previously reported in healthy men, contraction and relaxation of pelvic floor muscles induced strong activations in the brainstem and more rostral areas in our group of patients before and after RRP. In general, all of them had stronger activations during contraction than during relaxation in all regions before and after the operation. Even though there was no difference in the activation level when relaxing the pelvic floor before and after the operation, we found stronger activation during contraction when comparing the preoperative with the postoperative level in some of the regions. The results suggest that the same cortical and subcortical networks can be demonstrated for micturition control in patients with prostate cancer as in healthy subjects.

PAWR is a tumor suppressing gene essential for apoptosis and a cancer-selective target for cancer therapeutics. Here our study identified synthetic saRNAs that could activate the expression of PAWR in human cancer cells. Functional analysis of PAWR induction revealed that saRNA treatment induced growth inhibition and apoptosis of cancer cells, and predictably modulated the expression of known downstream target gene Bcl-2. New functional saRNAs can also be harvested by one or two-base shifting of the original target sites.

While primary care physicians, given their training, will likely be the locus of care under this model, there are certain conditions for which urologists are well suited to provide the continuous and comprehensive care called for by the patient centered medical home. To assess the feasibility of the urology based patient centered medical home, we analyzed national survey data.  Materials and methods:   For our measure of medical home infrastructure, we mapped items from the 2007 and 2008 NAMCS (National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey) to the NCQA (National Committee on Quality Assurance) standards for patient centered medical home recognition. We determined the proportion of urology practices in the United States that would achieve patient centered medical home recognition. Finally, we used NAMCS data to estimate the impact of consolidating genitourinary cancer (ie prostate, bladder, kidney and testis) followup care among the current supply of urologists.  Results:   Nearly three-quarters of urology practices meet NCQA standards for patient centered medical home recognition. At present, primary care physicians spend 9,295 cumulative workweeks providing direct and indirect care to survivors of genitourinary cancers. Off-loading half of this care to urology practices, in the context of the patient centered medical home, would generate an average of 0.73 additional workweeks for each practicing urologist.  Conclusions:   Urology practices may possess the capacity needed to direct medical homes for their patients with genitourinary cancers. Successful implementation of this model would likely require a willingness to manage some nonurological conditions.""","""['Joseph W Sakshaug', 'David C Miller', 'Brent K Hollenbeck', 'John T Wei', 'John M Hollingsworth']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) patient-centered medical home (PCMH) recognition is suboptimal even among innovative primary care practices.', 'The patient-centered medical home solution to the cost-quality conundrum.', 'Patient-centered medical homes in the United States.', 'Key aspects and health care benefits of patient-centered medical homes part 1 of 3.', 'The patient-centered medical home: history, components, and review of the evidence.', 'Differences in the Treatment of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia: Comparing the Primary Care Physician and the Urologist.', 'Anticipating the effect of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act for patients with urologic cancer.']"""

In this study, high-throughput analyses of concordant gene methylation and expression events were performed for 91 human prostate specimens, including prostate tumor (T), matched normal adjacent to tumor (AT), and organ donor (OD). Methylated DNA in genomic DNA was immunoprecipitated with anti-methylcytidine antibodies and detected by Affymetrix human whole genome SNP 6.0 chips. Among the methylated CpG islands, 11,481 islands were found located in the promoter and exon 1 regions of 9295 genes. Genes (7641) were methylated frequently across OD, AT, and T samples, whereas 239 genes were differentially methylated in only T and 785 genes in both AT and T but not OD. Genes with promoter methylation and concordantly suppressed expression were identified. Pathway analysis suggested that many of the methylated genes in T and AT are involved in cell growth and mitogenesis. Classification analysis of the differentially methylated genes in T or OD produced a specificity of 89.4% and a sensitivity of 85.7%. The T and AT groups, however, were only slightly separated by the prediction analysis, indicating a strong field effect. A gene methylation prediction model was shown to predict prostate cancer relapse with sensitivity of 80.0% and specificity of 85.0%.

To investigate the anticancer effect of a novel histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor MHY219, its efficacy was compared to that of suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) in human prostate cancer cells. The anticancer effects of MHY219 on cell viability, HDAC enzyme activity, cell cycle regulation, apoptosis and other biological assays were performed. MHY219 was shown to enhance the cytotoxicity on DU145 cells (IC₅₀, 0.36 μM) when compared with LNCaP (IC₅₀, 0.97 μM) and PC3 cells (IC₅₀, 5.12 μM). MHY219 showed a potent inhibition of total HDAC activity when compared with SAHA. MHY219 increased histone H3 hyperacetylation and reduced the expression of class I HDACs (1, 2 and 3) in prostate cancer cells. MHY219 effectively increased the sub-G1 fraction of cells through p21 and p27 dependent pathways in DU145 cells. MHY219 significantly induced a G2/M phase arrest in DU145 and PC3 cells and arrested the cell cycle at G0/G1 phase in LNCaP cells. Furthermore, MHY219 effectively increased apoptosis in DU145 and LNCaP cells, but not PC3 cells, according to Annexin V/PI staining and Western blot analysis.

Objective:   To determine whether overall survival (OS) on IHT (cyproterone acetate; CPA) is noninferior to OS on continuous MAB.  Design, setting, and participants:   This phase 3 randomised trial compared IHT and continuous MAB in patients with locally advanced or metastatic PCa.  Intervention:   During induction, patients received CPA 200 mg/d for 2 wk and then monthly depot injections of a luteinising hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH; triptoreline 11.25 mg) analogue plus CPA 200 mg/d. Patients whose prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was <4 ng/ml after 3 mo of induction treatment were randomised to the IHT arm (stopped treatment and restarted on CPA 300 mg/d monotherapy if PSA rose to ≥20 ng/ml or they were symptomatic) or the continuous arm (CPA 200 mg/d plus monthly LHRH analogue).  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Primary outcome measurement was OS. Secondary outcomes included cause-specific survival, time to subjective or objective progression, and quality of life. Time off therapy in the intermittent arm was recorded.  Results and limitations:   We recruited 1045 patients, of which 918 responded to induction therapy and were randomised (462 to IHT and 456 to continuous MAB). OS was similar between groups (p=0.25), and noninferiority of IHT was demonstrated (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.90; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.76-1.07). There was a trend for an interaction between PSA and treatment (p=0.05), favouring IHT over continuous therapy in patients with PSA ≤1 ng/ml (HR: 0.79; 95% CI, 0.61-1.02). Men treated with IHT reported better sexual function. Among the 462 patients on IHT, 50% and 28% of patients were off therapy for ≥2.5 yr or >5 yr, respectively, after randomisation. The main limitation is that the length of time for the trial to mature means that other therapies are now available. A second limitation is that T3 patients may now profit from watchful waiting instead of androgen-deprivation therapy.

Objective:   To evaluate everolimus, an inhibitor of mTOR, in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), and to explore potentially predictive serum biomarkers by proteomics, the significance of PTEN status in tumor tissue, and the impact of everolimus on immune cell subpopulations and function.  Design, setting, and participants:   A total of 37 chemotherapy-naive patients with mCRPC and progressive disease were recruited to this single-arm phase 2 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00976755).  Intervention:   Everolimus was administered continuously at a dose of 10mg daily.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS) at 12 wk defined as the absence of prostate-specific antigen (PSA), radiographic progression, or clinical progression. Groups were compared using Wilcoxon rank-sum tests or Fisher exact tests for continuous and discrete variables, respectively. Time-to-event end points were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and univariate Cox regression.  Results and limitations:   A total of 13 patients (35%; 95% confidence interval, 20-53) met the primary end point. Confirmed PSA response ≥50% was seen in two (5%), and four further patients (11%) had a PSA decline ≥30%. Higher serum levels of carboxypeptidase M and apolipoprotein B were predictive for reaching the primary end point. Deletion of PTEN was associated with longer PFS and response. Treatment was associated with a dose-dependent decrease of CD3, CD4, and CD8 T lymphocytes and CD8 proliferation and an increase in regulatory T cells. Small sample size was the major limitation of the study.  Conclusions:   Everolimus activity in unselected patients with mCRPC is moderate, but PTEN deletion could be predictive for response. Several serum glycoproteins were able to predict PFS at 12 wk. Prospective validation of these potential biomarkers is warranted.

Recent advances in biology demonstrate that direct reprogramming of somatic cells into pluripotent embryonic stem cell (ESC)-like cells is possible. These cells, termed induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), could theoretically generate adult prostate and bladder tissue, providing an alternative strategy to study differentiation.  Objective:   To generate human iPSCs derived from normal, ageing, human prostate (Pro-iPSC), and urinary tract (UT-iPSC) tissue and to assess their capacity for lineage-directed differentiation.  Design, setting, and participants:   Prostate and urinary tract stroma were transduced with POU class 5 homeobox 1 (POU5F1; formerly OCT4), SRY (sex determining region Y)-box 2 (SOX2), Kruppel-like factor 4 (gut) (KLF4), and v-myc myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog (avian) (MYC, formerly C-MYC) genes to generate iPSCs.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The potential for differentiation into prostate and bladder lineages was compared with classical skin-derived iPSCs. The student t test was used.  Results and limitations:   Successful reprogramming of prostate tissue into Pro-iPSCs and bladder and ureter into UT-iPSCs was demonstrated by characteristic ESC morphology, marker expression, and functional pluripotency in generating all three germ-layer lineages. In contrast to conventional skin-derived iPSCs, Pro-iPSCs showed a vastly increased ability to generate prostate epithelial-specific differentiation, as characterised by androgen receptor and prostate-specific antigen induction. Similarly, UT-iPSCs were shown to be more efficient than skin-derived iPSCs in undergoing bladder differentiation as demonstrated by expression of urothelial-specific markers: uroplakins, claudins, and cytokeratin; and stromal smooth muscle markers: α-smooth-muscle actin, calponin, and desmin. These disparities are likely to represent epigenetic differences between individual iPSC lines and highlight the importance of organ-specific iPSCs for tissue-specific studies.  Conclusions:   IPSCs provide an exciting new model to characterise mechanisms regulating prostate and bladder differentiation and to develop novel approaches to disease modelling.

This study has demonstrated that aptamer-conjugated unimolecular micelles can improve the in vivo tumor biodistribution of systemically administered anti-cancer drugs in prostate cancer expressing prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA). The aptamer-conjugated unimolecular micelles were formed by individual hyperbranched polymer molecules consisting of a hyperbranched H40 polymer core and approximately 25 amphiphilic polylactide-poly(ethlyene glycol) (PLA-PEG) block copolymer arms (H40-PLA-PEG-Apt). The unimolecular micelles with an average hydrodynamic diameter of 69 nm exhibited a pH-sensitive and controlled drug release behavior. The targeted unimolecular micelles (i.e., DOX-loaded H40-PLA-PEG-Apt) exhibited a much higher cellular uptake in PSMA positive CWR22Rν1 prostate carcinoma cells than non-targeted unimolecular micelles (i.e., DOX-loaded H40-PLA-PEG), thereby leading to a significantly higher cytotoxicity. The DOX-loaded unimolecular micelles up-regulated the cleavage of PARP and Caspase 3 proteins and increased the protein expression of Bax along with a concomitant decrease in Bcl2.

Margins accounting for setup uncertainties and intrafraction motion were determined.  Methods and materials:   The study included 17 patients undergoing prostate cancer radiation therapy. All patients received 3 fiducial gold markers implanted in the prostate and were then immobilized in the supine position with a knee support and treated with an ERB. Twelve patients with intermediate risk for pelvic lymph node metastases received intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), and 5 patients at low risk received a 4-field box treatment. After setup based on skin marks, patients were imaged with a stereoscopic imaging system. If the marker displacement exceeded a 3-mm tolerance relative to planning computed tomography, patients were shifted and verification images were taken. All patients underwent additional imaging after treatment; IMRT patients also received additional imaging at halftime of treatment. Prostate and bone drifts were evaluated as a function of treatment time for more than 600 fractions, and margins were extracted.  Results:   Patient motion evaluated by bone match was strongly patient dependent but in general was smallest in the superior-inferior (SI) direction. Prostate drifts were less patient dependent, showing an increase with treatment time in the SI and anterior-posterior (AP) directions. In the lateral (LAT) direction, the prostate stayed rather stable. Mean treatment times were 5.5 minutes for 4-field box, 10 minutes for 5-field boost IMRT, and 15 minutes or more for 9-field boost and 9-field pelvic IMRT treatments. Margins resulted in 2.2 mm, 3.9 mm, and 4.3 mm for 4-field box; 3.7 mm, 2.6 mm, and 3.6 mm for 5-field boost IMRT; 2.3 mm, 3.9 mm, and 6.2 mm for 9-field boost IMRT; and 4.2 mm, 5.1 mm, and 6.6 mm for 9-field pelvic IMRT in the LAT, SI, and AP directions, respectively.  Conclusion:   Intrafraction prostate and patient displacement increased with treatment time, showing different behaviors for the single directions of movement.

Methods and materials:   Longitudinal PSA data and various clinical parameters were examined in 157 consecutive patients treated with HDR monotherapy between 1996 and 2005. We used the following definition for PSA bounce: rise in PSA ≥threshold, after which it returns to the prior level or lower. Prostate-specific antigen failure was defined per the Phoenix definition (nadir +2 ng/mL).  Results:   A PSA bounce was noted in 67 patients (43%). The number of bounces per patient was 1 in 45 cases (67%), 2 in 19 (28%), 3 in 2 (3%), 4 in 0, and 5 in 1 (1%). The median time to maximum PSA bounce was 1.3 years, its median magnitude was 0.7, and its median duration was 0.75 years. Three patients (2%) were noted to have PSA failure. None of the 3 patients who experienced biochemical failure exhibited PSA bounce. In the fully adjusted model for predicting each bounce, patients aged <55 years had a statistically significant higher likelihood of experiencing a bounce (odds ratio 2.22, 95% confidence interval 1.38-3.57, P=.001). There was also a statistically significant higher probability of experiencing a bounce for every unit decrease in Gleason score (odds ratio 1.52, 95% confidence interval 1.01-2.04, P=.045).  Conclusions:   A PSA bounce occurs in a significant percentage of patients treated with HDR monotherapy, with magnitudes varying from <1 in 28% of cases to ≥1 in 15%.

Methods:   The most powerful of these prognostic factors, baseline prostate-specific antigen (PSA), was subdivided into quartiles to evaluate treatment effect patterns. Cox regression analyses were used to assess predictors of overall survival (OS) and sipuleucel-T treatment effect within PSA quartiles. Median OS was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method.  Results:   PSA was the strongest baseline prognostic factor (P <.0001). Furthermore, the sipuleucel-T treatment effect appeared greater with decreasing baseline PSA. The OS hazard ratio for patients in the lowest baseline PSA quartile (≤22.1 ng/mL) was 0.51 (95% confidence interval, 0.31-0.85) compared with 0.84 (95% confidence interval, 0.55-1.29) for patients in the highest PSA quartile (>134 ng/mL). Estimated improvement in median survival varied from 13.0 months in the lowest baseline PSA quartile to 2.8 months in the highest quartile. Estimated 3-year survival in the lowest PSA quartile was 62.6% for sipuleucel-T patients and 41.6% for control patients, representing a 50% relative increase.  Conclusion:   The greatest magnitude of benefit with sipuleucel-T treatment in this exploratory analysis was observed among patients with better baseline prognostic factors, particularly those with lower baseline PSA values.

However, little is known about non-AIDS-defining cancers (NADCs) without an infectious etiology. A total of 5,090 HIV-infected patients registered in the Local Health Authority (LHA) of Brescia and receiving primary care at our clinic were included in a retrospective (1999-2009) analysis. The cancer diagnoses were obtained through a record-linkage procedure between our database and the LHA general database and population-based Cancer Registry of LHA. We compared risks of these malignancies with those of the general population living in the same health area by using age-standardized incidence ratios (SIRs). Poisson regression analysis was used to assess factors associated with non-virus-related NADCs. We recorded an increase in the SIR of non-virus-related NADCs over time, with 138 cancers diagnosed in 131 patients. The mean incidence rate was 42.6/10,000 person years and the median age at the diagnosis was 49 (range, 28-78) years old. Stratifying for gender, only HIV-infected males had an increased risk of non-virus-related NADCs [SIR=1.86; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.55-2.26]. Risk was higher for lung (SIR=3.59; 95% CI, 2.36-5.45) and testis cancer (SIR=3.11; 95% CI, 1.48-6.52).

The only predictors of non-virus-related NADCs included older age [incidence rate ratio (IRR)=1.10; 95% CI, 1.08-1.12 per each additional year, p<0.001] and a shorter or no exposition to combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) (IRR=2.31; 95% CI, 1.38-3.89, p=0.002). A CD4⁺ count lower than 50/mm³ was significantly associated with cancers only in the univariate model (IRR=1.40; 95% CI, 0.99-1.98, p=0.057).

Recruitment is reported by major outreach strategy to inform the use of similar campaigns, either as primary recruitment efforts or to supplement ""in-reach"" recruitment within oncology settings.  Methods:   During a 33-month period, recruitment was tracked from the National Cancer Institute's Cancer Information Service (CIS), the American Cancer Society (ACS), Dr. Susan Love Research Foundation's Love/Avon Army of Women (AOW), Internet advertising, press releases, radio/television interviews, recruitment materials in community venues, and outreach to churches and cancer support organizations.  Results:   Across projects, the majority (89 %) of recruited participants (N = 2,134) was obtained from the CIS (n = 901, 19 months of recruitment), AOW (n = 869, 18 months), and ACS (n = 123, 12 months). Other efforts showed minimal gain in recruitment.  Conclusions:   Cancer information programs (e.g., CIS and ACS) and registries of individuals willing to participate in cancer-related research (e.g., AOW) can represent exceptional resources for outreach recruitment of cancer patients, especially when the eligibility criteria are highly restrictive. However, these resources do not yield samples representative of the larger population of adults diagnosed with cancer, and conclusions from such trials must be tempered accordingly.

We have analysed prostate tissue resections from patients with prostate cancer (PCa) and with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) for protein levels of uPA and PAI-1, and searched for distinctions between these two clinical manifestations.  Methods:   Prostate tissue was deep frozen in liquid N2 and homogenized in a stainless steel punch homogenizer. The tissue powder was extracted with a pH 8.5 TRIS/Triton X-100 buffer, and the extract analysed by FEMTELLE assay to generate uPA and PAI-1 readings in ng/mg protein. The uPA/PAI-1 ratio was calculated for each sample, and the mean ratios for the two diagnostic groups were compared.  Results:   The concentration of uPA (mean ± SD) was found to be 0.19 ± 0.04 ng/mg protein (range 0.05-0.72 ng/mg) and 0.15 ± 0.02 ng/mg protein (range 0.03-0.78 ng/mg) in PCa and BPH samples, respectively. The concentration of PAI-1 was found to be 4.93 ± 0.90 ng/mg (range 1.10-11.80 ng/mg) and 5.87 ± 0.70 ng/mg (range 0.2-25.0 ng/mg) in PCa and BPH samples, respectively. A consistent finding being that PAI-1 concentrations exceed uPA concentrations by far giving rise to characteristic uPA/PAI-1 ratios. In BPH samples, there was a trend of PAI-1 to increase with uPA content, while in PCa samples, PAI-1 remained fairly constant. The mean uPA/PAI-1 ratio in PCa samples was found to be 0.06 ± 0.01 and was significantly higher than in BPH samples where the mean uPA/PAI-1 ratio was 0.03 ± 0.003 (p = 0.0028). R(2) = 0.1389.  Conclusion:   Using a contingent of 62 patients of which 46 were BPH and 16 were PCa, we report definitive concentrations of uPA and PAI-1 in tumour tissue extracts and show that the uPA/PAI-1 ratio emerges as a candidate marker to distinguish between BPH and PCa.""","""['Lothar Böhm', 'Antonio Serafin', 'John Akudugu', 'Pedro Fernandez', 'Andre van der Merwe', 'Naseem A Aziz']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Cancer Res Clin Oncol""","""['Further evaluation of uPA and PAI-1 as biomarkers for prostatic diseases.', 'Influence of freeze-drying on the recovery of the tumour invasion markers uPA and PAI-1 from prostate cancer resections.', 'Urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) and plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) in tissue and serum of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients.', 'The urokinase plasminogen activation system in gastroesophageal cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'uPA and PAI-1 as biomarkers in breast cancer: validated for clinical use in level-of-evidence-1 studies.', 'Matriptase-2/NR4A3 axis switches TGF-β action toward suppression of prostate cancer cell invasion, tumor growth, and metastasis.', 'Roles of the Na+/H+ Exchanger Isoform 1 and Urokinase in Prostate Cancer Cell Migration and Invasion.', 'Role of pH Regulatory Proteins and Dysregulation of pH in Prostate Cancer.', 'Explication of the roles of prostate health index (PHI) and urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) as diagnostic and predictor tools for prostate cancer in equivocal PSA range of 4-10\xa0ng/mL.', 'Impacts of Cancer on Platelet Production, Activation and Education and Mechanisms of Cancer-Associated Thrombosis.']"""

The prostate-specific antigen (PSA), often found at high levels in the serum of PCa patients, has been used as a marker for PCa detection and as a target of immunotherapy. The murine IgG1 monoclonal antibody AR47.47, specific for human PSA, has been shown to enhance antigen presentation by human dendritic cells and induce both CD4 and CD8 T-cell activation when complexed with PSA. In this study, we explored the properties of a novel mouse/human chimeric anti-PSA IgE containing the variable regions of AR47.47 as a potential therapy for PCa. Our goal was to take advantage of the unique properties of IgE in order to trigger immune activation against PCa.  Methods:   Binding characteristics of the antibody were determined by ELISA and flow cytometry. In vitro degranulation was determined by the release of β-hexosaminidase from effector cells. In vivo degranulation was monitored in human FcεRIα transgenic mice using the passive cutaneous anaphylaxis assay. These mice were also used for a vaccination study to determine the in vivo anti-cancer effects of this antibody. Significant differences in survival were determined using the Log Rank test. In vitro T-cell activation was studied using human dendritic cells and autologous T cells.  Results:   The anti-PSA IgE, expressed in murine myeloma cells, is properly assembled and secreted, and binds the antigen and FcεRI. In addition, this antibody is capable of triggering effector cell degranulation in vitro and in vivo when artificially cross-linked, but not in the presence of the natural soluble antigen, suggesting that such an interaction will not trigger systemic anaphylaxis. Importantly, the anti-PSA IgE combined with PSA also triggers immune activation in vitro and in vivo and significantly prolongs the survival of human FcεRIα transgenic mice challenged with PSA-expressing tumors in a prophylactic vaccination setting.  Conclusions:   The anti-PSA IgE exhibits the expected biological properties and is capable of triggering immune activation and anti-tumor protection.

Methods:   During a 6-month period, 94 men with normal or suspicious digital rectal examination, normal or elevated prostate-specific antigen, or an increased prostate-specific antigen velocity were examined with Prostate HistoScanning. Based on these parameters and HistoScanning analysis, 41 men were referred for prostate biopsy under computer-aided ultrasonographic guidance. The number of random biopsy cores varied depending on the prostate volume. Targeted biopsies were taken in the case of computer-aided ultrasonographic area suspicious for malignancy. A logistic regression analysis was carried out to estimate the probability of resulting in a positive prostate biopsy based on the HistoScanning findings.  Results:   Following a logistic regression analysis, after adjusting for age, digital rectal examination, serum prostate-specific antigen level, prostate volume and tumor lesion volume, every cancer volume increase of 1 mL estimated by HistoScanning was associated with a nearly threefold increase in the probability of resulting in a positive biopsy (odds ratio 2.9; 95% confidence interval 1.2-7.0; P-value 0.02). Prostate cancer was found in 17 of 41 men (41%). In patients with cancer, computer-aided ultrasonography-guided biopsy was 4.5-fold more likely to detect cancer than random biopsy. The prostate cancer detection rate for random biopsy and directed biopsy was 13% and 58%, respectively. HistoScanning-guided biopsy significantly decreased the number of biopsies necessary (P-value <0.0001).  Conclusions:   Our findings suggest that Prostate HistoScanning might be helpful for the selection of patients in whom prostate biopsies are necessary.

However, the mechanism of action has not yet been determined. The nuclear transcription factor-kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway plays a critical role in tumor cell survival, proliferation, invasion, metastasis, and angiogenesis, so we determined the effects of PMS1077 and its structural analogs on tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) induced activation of NF-κB signaling. In this study, we found that PMS1077 inhibited TNF-α induced expression of the NF-κB regulated reporter gene in a dose dependent manner. Western blot assay indicated that PMS1077 suppressed the TNF-α induced inhibitor of κB-α (IκB-α) phosphorylation, IκB-α degradation, and p65 phosphorylation. PMS1077 consistently blocked TNF-α induced p65 nuclear translocation as demonstrated in the immunofluorescence assay used. Docking studies by molecular modeling predicted that PMS1077 might interact directly with the IκB kinase-β (IKK-β) subunit. These results suggested that PMS1077 might suppress the activation of NF-κB by targeting IKK-β involved in the NF-κB signaling pathway. Finally, we showed that PMS1077 sensitized cells to TNF-α induced apoptosis by suppressing the expression of NF-κB regulated anti-apoptotic genes.

The majority of prostate cancer studies focused on individual single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) while SNP-SNP interactions are suggested having a great impact on unveiling the underlying mechanism of complex disease. Using 1,151 prostate cancer patients in the Cancer Genetic Markers of Susceptibility (CGEMS) dataset, 2,651 SNPs in the angiogenesis genes associated with prostate cancer aggressiveness were evaluated. SNP-SNP interactions were primarily assessed using the two-stage Random Forests plus Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (TRM) approach in the CGEMS group, and were then re-evaluated in the Moffitt group with 1,040 patients. For the identified gene pairs, cross-evaluation was applied to evaluate SNP interactions in both study groups. Five SNP-SNP interactions in three gene pairs (MMP16+ ROBO1, MMP16+ CSF1, and MMP16+ EGFR) were identified to be associated with aggressive prostate cancer in both groups. Three pairs of SNPs (rs1477908+ rs1387665, rs1467251+ rs7625555, and rs1824717+ rs7625555) were in MMP16 and ROBO1, one pair (rs2176771+ rs333970) in MMP16 and CSF1, and one pair (rs1401862+ rs6964705) in MMP16 and EGFR. The results suggest that MMP16 may play an important role in prostate cancer aggressiveness. By integrating our novel findings and available biomedical literature, a hypothetical gene interaction network was proposed. This network demonstrates that our identified SNP-SNP interactions are biologically relevant and shows that EGFR may be the hub for the interactions.

The objective of this study was to determine the efficacy of dietary tomato and soy germ, alone and in combination, for the inhibition of PCa in the transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate (TRAMP) model. At 4 weeks of age, male C57BL/6 × FVB TRAMP mice (n = 119) were randomized to consume: AIN-93G control, 10% whole tomato powder (TP), 2% soy germ powder (SG), or 10% tomato powder with 2% soy germ powder (TP+SG) for 14 weeks. One hundred percent of mice fed the control diet had PCa, whereas PCa incidence was significantly lower in mice consuming TP (61%, P < 0.001), SG (66%, P < 0.001), and TP+SG (45%, P < 0.001). Although the protection offered by the combination of TP and SG was not synergistic, it was the most effective intervention. TP, SG, and TP+SG increased apoptotic index (AI) and modestly reduced the proliferative index (PI) in the prostate epithelium of TRAMP mice exhibiting primarily prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia. The dramatic reduction in the PI/AI ratio by the dietary interventions suggests that the control mice experience a stronger stimulus for malignant progression in the prostate microenvironment.

The goal of this research was to identify specific PDEF induced molecules that, like PDEF, show overexpression in breast tumors and a role in breast tumor progression. PDEF expression was down regulated by shRNA in MCF-7 human breast tumor cell line, and probes from PDEF down-regulated and control MCF-7 cells were used to screen the HG-U133A human gene chips. These analyses identified 1318 genes that were induced two-fold or higher by PDEF in MCF-7 cells. Further analysis of three of these genes, namely CEACAM6, S100A7 and B7-H4, in relation to PDEF in primary breast tumors showed that in 82% of ER+, 67% of Her2 overexpressing and 24% of triple-negative breast tumors both PDEF and CEACAM6 expression was elevated 10-fold or higher in comparison to normal breast tissue. Overall, 72% (94 of 131) of the primary breast tumors showed 10-fold or higher expression of both PDEF and CEACAM6. In contrast, S100A7 and B7-H4 failed to show concordant elevated expression with PDEF in primary tumors. To determine the significance of elevated PDEF and CEACAM6 expression to tumor phenotype, their expression was down regulated by specific siRNAs in human breast tumor cell lines. This resulted in the loss of viability of tumor cells in vitro, supporting an oncogenic role for both PDEF and CEACAM6 in breast cancer. Together, these findings show that PDEF-CEACAM6 is a highly active oncogenic axis in breast cancer and suggest that targeting of these molecules should provide novel treatments for most breast cancer patients.""","""['Alka Mukhopadhyay', 'Thaer Khoury', 'Leighton Stein', 'Protul Shrikant', 'Ashwani K Sood']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['PDEF and PDEF-induced proteins as candidate tumor antigens for T cell and antibody-mediated immunotherapy of breast cancer.', 'AR-PDEF pathway promotes tumour proliferation and upregulates MYC-mediated gene transcription by promoting MAD1 degradation in ER-negative breast cancer.', 'Prostate-derived Ets transcription factor (PDEF) downregulates survivin expression and inhibits breast cancer cell growth in vitro and xenograft tumor formation in vivo.', 'Prostate-derived Ets transcription factor overexpression is associated with nodal metastasis and hormone receptor positivity in invasive breast cancer.', 'Prostate-derived Ets factor, an oncogenic driver in breast cancer.', 'The subtype-specific molecular function of SPDEF in breast cancer and insights into prognostic significance.', 'Comparison of methods for the detection of outliers and associated biomarkers in mislabeled omics data.', 'Double Agent: SPDEF Gene with Both Oncogenic and Tumor-Suppressor Functions in Breast Cancer.', 'Upregulation of SPDEF is associated with poor prognosis in prostate cancer.', 'B7-H4 overexpression contributes to poor prognosis and drug-resistance in triple-negative breast cancer.']"""

Improved risk prediction models using genomic information may enable clinicians to better weigh the risk of metastasis and the morbidity and costs of treatment in a clinically heterogeneous population.  Purpose:   We present a clinical utility study that evaluates the influence on urologist treatment recommendations for patients at risk of metastasis using a genomic-based prediction model (DecipherTM).  Methods:   A prospective, pre-post design was used to assess urologist treatment recommendations following RP in both the adjuvant (without any evidence of PSA rise) and salvage (BCR) settings. Urologists were presented de-identified pathology reports and genomic classifier (GC) test results for 24 patients from a previously conducted GC validation study in high-risk post-RP men. Participants were fellowship trained, high-volume urologic oncologists (n=21) from 18 US institutions. Treatment recommendations for secondary therapy were made based solely on clinical information (pre-GC) and then with genomic biomarker information (post-GC). This study was approved by an independent IRB.  Results:   Treatment recommendations changed from pre-GC to post-GC in 43% of adjuvant, and in 53% of salvage setting case evaluations. In the adjuvant setting, urologists changed their treatment recommendations from treatment (i.e. radiation and/or hormones) to close observation post-GC in 27% of cases. For cases with low GC risk (more than 3% risk of metastasis), observation was recommended for 79% of the case evaluations post-GC. Consistent trends were observed in the salvage setting.  Conclusion:   These results indicate that urologists across a range of practice settings are likely to change treatment decisions when presented with genomic biomarker information following RP.

Objective:   The aim of this study was to analyze safety and tolerability of GX301 in an open-label, phase I/II trial. Immunological and clinical responses were also evaluated as secondary endpoints.  Experimental design:   GX301 was administered by intradermally injecting 500 μg of each peptide (dissolved in Montanide ISA-51) in the skin of the abdomen. Imiquimod was applied as a cream at the injection sites. The protocol included 8 administrations at days 1, 3, 5, 7, 14, 21, 35, 63. Eligible patients were affected with stage IV prostate or renal cancer resistant to conventional treatments. Patients were clinically and immunologically monitored up to 6 months from the first immunization.  Results:   No grade 3-4 adverse events were observed. Evidence of vaccine-specific immunological responses was detected in 100 % of patients. Disease stabilization occurred in 4 patients.

Methods:   Included in the study were 15 patients with biochemical relapse after initial radical treatment of prostate cancer. All the patients underwent anti-3-(18)F-FACBC PET/CT and (11)C-choline PET/CT within a 7-day period. The detection rates using the two compounds were determined and the target-to-background ratios (TBR) of each lesion are reported.  Results:   No adverse reactions to anti-3-(18)F-FACBC PET/CT were noted. On a patient basis, (11)C-choline PET/CT was positive in 3 patients and negative in 12 (detection rate 20%), and anti-3-(18)F-FACBC PET/CT was positive in 6 patients and negative in 9 (detection rate 40%). On a lesion basis, (11)C-choline detected 6 lesions (4 bone, 1 lymph node, 1 local relapse), and anti-3-(18)F-FACBC detected 11 lesions (5 bone, 5 lymph node, 1 local relapse). All (11)C-choline-positive lesions were also identified by anti-3-(18)F-FACBC PET/CT. The TBR of anti-3-(18)F-FACBC was greater than that of (11)C-choline in 8/11 lesions, as were image quality and contrast.  Conclusion:   Our preliminary results indicate that anti-3-(18)F-FACBC may be superior to (11)C-choline for the identification of disease recurrence in the setting of biochemical failure.

In the present study, we investigated the role of ATF3 SUMOylation on CCND activity and cellular proliferation in human prostate cancer cells. First, we showed that ATF3 can be SUMOylated endogenously in the overexpression system, and lysine 42 is the major SUMO site. Unlike normal prostate tissue and androgen-responsive LNCaP cancer cells, androgen-independent PC3 and DU145 cancer cells did not express ATF3 endogenously. Overexpression of ATF3 increased CCND1/2 expression in PC3 and DU145 cancer cells. Interestingly, we observed that SUMOylation is essential for ATF3-mediated CCND1/2 activation. Finally, we observed that SUMOylation plays a functional role in ATF3-mediated cellular proliferation in PC3 and DU145 cells.

Methods:   A total of 100 prostate cancer patients underwent RRP after preoperative complete urodynamic examination. Detrusor contractility was evaluated by bladder contractility index (BCI), power at maximum flow (WF-Qmax), and maximum velocity of detrusorial contraction (MVDC). Follow-up included uroflowmetry with bladder post-voiding volume evaluation at 3 and 6 months after surgery and repeated urodynamic examination at 12 months.

However, the mechanisms regulating HMGA2 expression remain incompletely understood. The objective of this study was to investigate whether mir-154 plays a critical role in EMT by regulating HMGA2. The expression levels of HMGA2 were examined in four samples of prostate cancer (PCa) tissue and adjacent non-tumorous tissue by Western blot analysis. The effects of forced expression of miR-154 or HMGA2 knockdown on PCa cells were evaluated by cell migration and invasion assays and Western blot analysis. HMGA2 was upregulated in the PCa tissue samples compared with the adjacent normal ones. Forced expression of miR-154 or HMGA2 knockdown significantly reduced the migratory and invasive capabilities of PCa cells in vitro and inhibited EMT gene expression, increased the levels of E-cadherin, an epithelial marker, and decreased the levels of vimentin, a mesenchymal marker. HMGA2 is a direct target gene of miR-154 by dual-luciferase reporter assay. Our findings suggest that miR-154 plays a role in regulating EMT by targeting HMGA2.

Despite a number of evidence-based studies which strongly suggest an association between cigarette smoking and prostate cancer, the underlying biological mechanism is largely unknown. Heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) has been implicated in maintaining cellular homeostasis, but also in tumor angiogenesis. Nuclear HO-1 protein expression has been observed in various types of tumors including prostate cancer. These studies, however, were reported as clinical and pathological observations, and failed to investigate nuclear HO-1 at the molecular level in cancer. The present study explores the relationship between cigarette smoke and nuclear HO-1-modulated promotion of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secretion. We have demonstrated that cigarette smoke medium (SM)-induced HO-1 mRNA expression and upregulated HO-1 protein levels in the prostate cancer cell lines DU145 and PC3. We also observed that SM significantly induced nuclear expression of HO-1, and enhanced secretion of VEGF in cells. Nuclear-directed expression of HO-1 activated the transcriptional activity of VEGF and promoted VEGF secretion in prostate cancer cells. This study provides new insights into the molecular mechanism by which cigarette smoke-induced nuclear translocation of HO-1 promotes VEGF secretion in prostate cancer cells. Nuclear HO-1 may, therefore, constitute an attractive therapeutic target to inhibit angiogenesis and the progression of prostate cancer.""","""['Gabriel Birrane', 'Huchun Li', 'Suping Yang', 'Souvenir D Tachado', 'Seyha Seng']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Int J Oncol""","""['Hypoxia-responsive microRNA-101 promotes angiogenesis via heme oxygenase-1/vascular endothelial growth factor axis by targeting cullin 3.', 'Camptothecin suppresses expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 and vascular endothelial growth factor in DU145 cells through PI3K/Akt-mediated inhibition of NF-κB activity and Nrf2-dependent induction of HO-1 expression.', 'Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression in prostate cancer cells modulates the oxidative response in bone cells.', 'Heme oxygenase-1: emerging target of cancer therapy.', 'Relationship between cigarette use and prostate cancer risk: what do we know and what should we do?', 'The impact of conventional smoking versus electronic cigarette on the expression of VEGF, PEMPA1, and PTEN in rat prostate.', 'Association of cigarette smoking habits with the risk of prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Pharmacological Significance of Heme Oxygenase 1 in Prostate Cancer.', 'Exposure to Heated Tobacco Products Aerosol Causes Acute Stress Responses in the Lung of Mouse.', 'The Nuclear Translocation of Heme Oxygenase-1 in Human Diseases.']"""

Methods:   In this study, we retrospectively analysed the clinical records and evaluated the VASH1 expression of tumour microvessels in 167 patients with PCa who underwent radical prostatectomy. We immunohistochemically examined the microvessels positive for anti-CD34 as microvessel density (MVD) and the microvessels with activated ECs positive for VASH1 density.  Results:   We found that the VASH1 expression was restricted to ECs in the tumour stroma. VASH1 density was significantly associated with pathological T stage, Gleason score and MVD. The 5-year PSA recurrence-free survival rate was 58.8% in patients with higher VASH1 density (≧12 per mm(2)) and 89.1% in patients with lower VASH1 density (<12 per mm(2)), respectively (P<0.001).

Multimeric targeting ligands may be produced by tethering multiple identical or two or more monomeric ligands of different binding specificities. Consequently, multimeric ligands may simultaneously bind to multiple receptor molecules. Previously, multimerization has been successfully applied on radiolabeled RGD peptides, which resulted in an improved tumor targeting activity in animal models. Multimerization of peptide-based ligands may improve the binding characteristics by increasing local ligand concentration and by improving dissociation kinetics. Here, we present a preclinical study on a novel radiolabeled bombesin (BN) homodimer, designated (111)In-DOTA-[(Aca-BN(7-14)]2, that was designed for enhanced targeting of gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR)-positive prostate cancer cells. A BN homodimer was conjugated with DOTA-NHS and labeled with (111)In. After HPLC purification, the GRPR targeting ability of (111)In-DOTA-[Aca-BN(7-14)]2 was assessed by microSPECT imaging in SCID mice xenografted with the human prostate cancer cell line PC-3.

To investigate the metabolism of degarelix in humans, in vitro metabolism was addressed in liver tissue and in vivo metabolism was studied in plasma and excreta samples collected in clinical studies. In addition, drug transporter interaction potential of degarelix with selected efflux transporters and uptake transporters was studied using in vitro membrane vesicle-based assays and whole cell-based assays. In vitro degradation was observed in fresh hepatocytes; less than 25% of the initial concentration of degarelix remained after incubation at 37°C for 2 hours. One metabolite was detected, representing a truncated nonapeptide of degarelix. The same metabolite was also detected at low concentrations in plasma. The in vivo investigations also showed that degarelix is excreted unchanged via the urine but is undergoing extensive sequential peptidic degradation during its elimination via the hepato-biliary pathway. No unique human metabolites of degarelix were detected in the circulation or in the excreta. Degarelix did not show any interaction with selected efflux transporters and uptake transporters up to concentrations representing 200 times the clinical concentration. Because degarelix does not seem to interact with the cytochrome P450 enzyme system as substrate, inhibitor, or inducer and does not show any interaction with hepatic and renal uptake and efflux transporters, the risk for pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions with this compound is highly unlikely.""","""['Anders Sonesson', 'Birgitte Buur Rasmussen']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Drug Metab Dispos""","""['Metabolite profiles of degarelix, a new gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor antagonist, in rat, dog, and monkey.', 'In vitro studies investigating the interactions between degarelix, a decapeptide gonadotropin-releasing hormone blocker, and cytochrome P450.', 'Gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor-targeted paclitaxel-degarelix conjugate: synthesis and in vitro evaluation.', 'Degarelix for prostate cancer.', 'Degarelix: a gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist for the management of prostate cancer.', 'Investigation of the GnRH antagonist degarelix isomerization in biological matrices.', 'Advances in the stability challenges of bioactive peptides and improvement strategies.', 'Degarelix versus luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonists for the treatment of prostate cancer.']"""

We report here the preclinical characteristics of cabazitaxel (XRP6258), a semisynthetic taxane developed to overcome taxane resistance.  Experimental design:   Cabazitaxel effects on purified tubulin and on taxane-sensitive or chemotherapy-resistant tumor cells were evaluated in vitro. Antitumor activity and pharmacokinetics of intravenously administered cabazitaxel were assessed in tumor-bearing mice.  Results:   In vitro, cabazitaxel stabilized microtubules as effectively as docetaxel but was 10-fold more potent than docetaxel in chemotherapy-resistant tumor cells (IC50 ranges: cabazitaxel, 0.013-0.414 μmol/L; docetaxel, 0.17-4.01 μmol/L). The active concentrations of cabazitaxel in these cell lines were achieved easily and maintained for up to 96 hours in the tumors of mice bearing MA16/C tumors treated with cabazitaxel at 40 mg/kg. Cabazitaxel exhibited antitumor efficacy in a broad spectrum of murine and human tumors (melanoma B16, colon C51, C38, HCT 116, and HT-29, mammary MA17/A and MA16/C, pancreas P03 and MIA PaCa-2, prostate DU 145, lung A549 and NCI-H460, gastric N87, head and neck SR475, and kidney Caki-1). Of particular note, cabazitaxel was active in tumors poorly sensitive or innately resistant to docetaxel (Lewis lung, pancreas P02, colon HCT-8, gastric GXF-209, mammary UISO BCA-1) or with acquired docetaxel resistance (melanoma B16/TXT).

However, the mechanism(s) through which stromal cells regulate epithelial cells and the differences among prostatic stromal cells of different histological/pathological origin in PCa progression remain unclear. Therefore, it is necessary to characterize the stromal cell populations present in benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and PCa. To this end, we used cultures from stromal cells obtained from BPH-derived (15 cases) and PCa-derived (30 cases) primary cultures. In culture, stromal cells are a mixture of fibroblasts, myofibroblasts (MFs) and muscle cells. Fibroblasts are characterized for the expression of vimentin, MFs for the co-expression of α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and vimentin, whereas muscle cells for the expression of α-SMA and desmin. Fibroblasts were present in large amounts in the BPH- compared to the PCa-derived cultures, whereas MFs were more representative of PCa- as opposed to BPH-derived cultures. Some α-SMA-positive cells retained the expression of basal cytokeratin K14. This population was defined as myoepithelial cells and was associated with senescent cultures. The percentage of MFs was higher in high-grade compared to moderate- and low-grade PCa-derived cultures, whereas the number of myoepithelial cells was lower in high-grade compared to moderate- and low-grade PCa-derived cultures. In addition, we analyzed the expression of p75NTR, as well as the expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, MMP-9 and tissue inhibitors of MMPs (TIMPs). p75NTR expression was elevated in the stromal cultures derived from PCa compared to those derived from BPH and in cultures derived from cases with Gleason scores ≥7 compared to those derived from cases with Gleason scores <7, as well as in cultures with a high concentration of MFs compared to those with a high concentration of fibroblasts. MMP-2 was secreted by all primary cultures, whereas MMP-9 secretion was observed only in some PCa-derived stromal cells, when the percentage of MFs was significantly higher compared to BPH-derived cultures. TIMP1, TIMP2 and TIMP3 were secreted in elevated amounts in the BPH- compared to the PCa-derived stromal cultures, suggesting the differential regulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation. When we used 22rv1 and PC3 PCa xenograft models for the isolation and characterization of murine cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) we noted that the angiogenic wave was concurrent with the appearance of a reactive stroma phenotype, as determined by staining for α-SMA, vimentin, tenascin, calponin, desmin and Masson's trichrome. In conclusion, MF stromal cells from PCa participate in the progression and metastasis of PCa, modualting inflammation, angiogenesis and epithelial cancer cell proliferation.""","""['Giovanni Luca Gravina', 'Andrea Mancini', 'Guido Ranieri', 'Boris Di Pasquale', 'Francesco Marampon', 'Luigi Di Clemente', 'Enrico Ricevuto', 'Claudio Festuccia']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Int J Oncol""","""['Expression of matrix metalloproteinase-2 and -9 and their inhibitors, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 and -2, in primary cultures of human prostatic stromal and epithelial cells.', 'Phenotypic differences of stroma cells in benign and malignant human prostate tissues.', 'Epithelial and prostatic marker expression in short-term primary cultures of human prostate tissue samples.', 'Role of stroma in carcinogenesis of the prostate.', 'Role of the stromal microenvironment in carcinogenesis of the prostate.', 'Mixture of Corni Fructus and Schisandrae Fructus improves testosterone-induced benign prostatic hyperplasia through regulating 5α-reductase 2 and androgen receptor.', 'Early Cell Cultures from Prostate Cancer Tissue Express Tissue Specific Epithelial and Cancer Markers.', 'Pilot Investigation on p75ICD Expression in Laryngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma.', 'The Role of the Metzincin Superfamily in Prostate Cancer Progression: A Systematic-Like Review.', 'Differential impact of paired patient-derived BPH and normal adjacent stromal cells on benign prostatic epithelial cell growth in 3D culture.']"""

Clinical trials have shown potential inhibitory effects of selenium in advanced or aggressive prostate cancer. However, its mechanism of action remains unclear. This study investigated the mechanism of action of sodium selenite in human prostate cancer PC-3 cells using proteomics. CCK-8 assays were used to detect cell viability and the inhibitory rate. Cell apoptosis was detected by annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide double staining using flow cytometry. Selenite inhibited the growth of PC-3 cells causing them to display morphological changes typical of apoptosis. The rate of cell apoptosis also increased. Proteomics identified a variety of differentially expressed proteins in PC-3 cells exposed to selenite. Eighteen protein spots were identified by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. These proteins were separated into those involved in redox balance, protein degradation and cellular energy metabolism. Three differently expressed proteins (SOD1, Stathmin and Erp29) were chosen for Western blot verification, together with several apoptosis-related proteins. Western blot analyses showed that selenite-induced apoptosis was accompanied by activation of caspase-8 and specific proteolytic cleavage of PARP. This led to an increase in the pro-apoptotic protein Bax, and to a decrease in the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and in hypoxia inducible factor-1α. Increased ROS generation and decreased mitochondrial membrane potential were consistent with reduced expression of antioxidative proteins identified by comparative proteomics. We therefore propose that sodium selenite induces the apoptosis of PC-3 cells mainly through the mitochondrial pathway, but also via ER stress and HIF-1α mediated pathways.""","""['Ping Chen', 'Lixiang Wang', 'Na Li', 'Qiong Liu', 'Jiazuan Ni']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Metallomics""","""['Proteomic study on sodium selenite-induced apoptosis of human cervical cancer HeLa cells.', 'The protection of selenium on ROS mediated-apoptosis by mitochondria dysfunction in cadmium-induced LLC-PK(1) cells.', 'Induction of apoptosis and autophagy by sodium selenite in A549 human lung carcinoma cells through generation of reactive oxygen species.', 'Bioeffects of low-intensity ultrasound in vitro: apoptosis, protein profile alteration, and potential molecular mechanism.', 'Sodium selenite and cancer related lymphedema: Biological and pharmacological effects.', 'Selenium-enriched plant foods: Selenium accumulation, speciation, and health functionality.', 'Biogenic Selenium Nanoparticles and Their Anticancer Effects Pertaining to Probiotic Bacteria-A Review.', 'Targeting regulated cell death in tumor nanomedicines.', 'H2Se Induces Reductive Stress in HepG2 Cells and Activates Cell Autophagy by Regulating the Redox of HMGB1 Protein under Hypoxia.', 'Biogenic selenium nanoparticles induce ROS-mediated necroptosis in PC-3 cancer cells through TNF activation.']"""

However, few data exist that quantify the chain of events following screening in clinical practice to better inform decisions.  Objective:   To quantify 5-year downstream outcomes following a PSA screening result exceeding 4.0 ng/mL in older men.  Design and setting:   Longitudinal cohort study in the national Veterans Affairs health care system.  Participants:   In total, 295,645 men 65 years or older who underwent PSA screening in the Veterans Affairs health care system in 2003 and were followed up for 5 years using national Veterans Affairs and Medicare data.  Main outcome measures:   Among men whose index screening PSA level exceeded 4.0 ng/mL, we determined the number who underwent prostate biopsy, were diagnosed as having prostate cancer, were treated for prostate cancer, and were treated for prostate cancer and were alive at 5 years according to baseline characteristics. Biopsy and treatment complications were also assessed.  Results:   In total, 25,208 men (8.5%) had an index PSA level exceeding 4.0 ng/mL. During the 5-year follow-up period, 8313 men (33.0%) underwent at least 1 prostate biopsy, and 5220 men (62.8%) who underwent prostate biopsy were diagnosed as having prostate cancer, of whom 4284 (82.1%) were treated for prostate cancer. Performance of prostate biopsy decreased with advancing age and worsening comorbidity (P < .001), whereas the percentage treated for biopsy-detected cancer exceeded 75% even among men 85 years or older, those with a Charlson-Deyo Comorbidity Index of 3 or higher, and those having low-risk cancer. Among men with biopsy-detected cancer, the risk of death from non-prostate cancer causes increased with advancing age and worsening comorbidity (P < .001). In total, 468 men (5.6%) had complications within 7 days after prostate biopsy. Complications of prostate cancer treatment included new urinary incontinence in 584 men (13.6%) and new erectile dysfunction 588 men (13.7%).  Conclusions and relevance:   Performance of prostate biopsy is uncommon in older men with abnormal screening PSA levels and decreases with advancing age and worsening comorbidity. However, once cancer is detected on biopsy, most men undergo immediate treatment regardless of advancing age, worsening comorbidity, or low-risk cancer. Understanding downstream outcomes in clinical practice should better inform individualized decisions among older men considering PSA screening.""","""['Louise C Walter', 'Kathy Z Fung', 'Katharine A Kirby', 'Ying Shi', 'Roxanne Espaldon', ""Sarah O'Brien"", 'Stephen J Freedland', 'Adam A Powell', 'Richard M Hoffman']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""JAMA Intern Med""","""['Screening for Prostate Cancer: US Preventive Services Task Force Recommendation Statement.', 'Clinician Factors Associated With Prostate-Specific Antigen Screening in Older Veterans With Limited Life Expectancy.', 'Low-Value Prostate Cancer Screening Among Older Men Within the Veterans Health Administration.', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen-Based Screening for Prostate Cancer: Evidence Report and Systematic Review for the US Preventive Services Task Force.', 'American Urological Association (AUA) guideline on prostate cancer detection: process and rationale.', 'Assessment of Care Cascades Following Low-Value Prostate-Specific Antigen Testing Among Veterans Dually Enrolled in the US Veterans Health Administration and Medicare Systems.', 'Low-Value Prostate-Specific Antigen Test for Prostate Cancer Screening and Subsequent Health Care Utilization and Spending.', '6-gene promoter methylation assay is potentially applicable for prostate cancer clinical staging based on urine collection following prostatic massage.', 'Yield of prostate cancer screening at a community based clinic in Saudi Arabia.', 'General health checks in adults for reducing morbidity and mortality from disease.']"""

Both genes lie adjacent on chromosome 3 and differ mostly by the presence of a transmembrane domain in RARRES1. Despite their homology, it is not known whether they possess similar regulatory mechanisms, cellular localization and function. Here, we identified RARRES1 and LXN as highly significantly downregulated genes in human prostate SCs, whose expression was induced by the pro-differentiation agent all-trans retinoic acid (atRA). AtRA induced expression in the most differentiated cells compared with the SC fraction, suggesting that this subpopulation was less responsive to atRA. Small interfering RNA suppression of RARRES1 and LXN enhanced the SC properties of primary prostate cultures, as shown by a significant increase in their colony-forming ability. Expression of both RARRES1 and LXN was co-ordinately repressed by DNA methylation in prostate cancer cell lines and inhibition of RARRES1 and LXN increased the invasive capacity of primary prostate cultures, which also fully rescued an inhibitory effect induced by atRA. Moreover, we showed that RARRES1 and LXN reside within different sub-cellular compartments, providing evidence that RARRES1 is not a plasma membrane protein as previously supposed but is located primarily in the endoplasmic reticulum; whereas LXN was detected in the nucleus of prostate epithelial cells. Thus, LXN and RARRES1 are potential tumour suppressor genes, which are co-ordinately regulated, SC-silenced genes functioning to suppress invasion and colony-forming ability of prostate cancer cells; yet the proteins reside within different sub-cellular compartments.""","""['E E Oldridge', 'H F Walker', 'M J Stower', 'M S Simms', 'V M Mann', 'A T Collins', 'D Pellacani', 'N J Maitland']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Oncogenesis""","""['The putative tumour suppressor protein Latexin is secreted by prostate luminal cells and is downregulated in malignancy.', 'The SNP rs6441224 influences transcriptional activity and prognostically relevant hypermethylation of RARRES1 in prostate cancer.', 'Latexin expression is downregulated in human gastric carcinomas and exhibits tumor suppressor potential.', 'Gene methylation in gastric cancer.', 'Complexity, retinoid-responsive gene networks, and bladder carcinogenesis.', 'Oxidative Stress Response Biomarkers of Ovarian Cancer Based on Single-Cell and Bulk RNA Sequencing.', 'Interaction of RARRES1 with ICAM1 modulates macrophages to suppress the progression of kidney renal clear cell carcinoma.', 'Bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) as an epigenetic regulator of fatty acid metabolism genes and ferroptosis.', 'Loss of RARRES1 function Promotes Follicular Lymphomagenesis and Inhibits B cell Differentiation in Mice.', 'Latexin deficiency attenuates adipocyte differentiation and protects mice against obesity and metabolic disorders induced by high-fat diet.']"""

Treatment with imiquimod induced cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase in TRMPA-C2 cells, confirmed by the changes of G2/M checkpoint regulators such as reduction of cyclin B1 expression and increase of phospho-CDC2 and p21 in TRAMP-C2 cells treated with imiquimod. Flow cytometry and western blot analysis revealed that imiquimod induced direct apoptosis in TRAMP-C2 cells via a mitochondrial‑dependent pathway.

Objective:   To elucidate the prevalence of lower urinary tract symptoms, urinary bother, and incontinence in elderly PCa survivors compared with peers without PCa.  Design, setting, and participants:   A cross-sectional analysis of 5990 participants in the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men Research Group, a cohort study of community-dwelling men ≥ 65 yr.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   We characterized urinary health using self-reported urinary incontinence and the American Urological Association Symptom Index (AUA-SI). We compared urinary health measures according to type of PCa treatment in men with PCa and men without PCa using multivariate log-binomial regression to generate prevalence ratios (PRs).  Results and limitations:   At baseline, 706 men (12%) reported a history of PCa, with a mean time since diagnosis of 6.3 yr. Of these men, 426 (60%) reported urinary incontinence. In adjusted analyses, observation (PR: 2.11; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.22-3.65; p=0.007), surgery (PR: 4.41; 95% CI, 3.79-5.13; p<0.0001), radiation therapy (PR: 1.49; 95% CI, 1.06-2.08; p=0.02), and androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) (PR: 2.02; 95% CI, 1.31-3.13; p=0.002) were each associated with daily incontinence. Daily incontinence risk increased with time since diagnosis independently of age. Observation (PR: 1.33; 95% CI, 1.00-1.78; p=0.05), surgery (PR: 1.25; 95% CI, 1.10-1.42; p=0.0008), and ADT (PR: 1.50; 95% CI, 1.26-1.79; p<0.0001) were associated with increased AUA-SI bother scores. Cancer stage and use of adjuvant or salvage therapies were not available for analysis.  Conclusions:   Compared with their peers without PCa, elderly PCa survivors had a two-fold to five-fold greater prevalence of urinary incontinence, which rose with increasing survivorship duration.

However, this clinical tool has never been validated externally.  Objective:   To validate CAPRA-S in a large, multi-institutional, external database.  Design, setting, and participants:   The Shared Equal Access Regional Cancer Hospital (SEARCH) database consists of 2892 men who underwent RP from 2001 to 2011. With a median follow-up of 58 mo, 2670 men (92%) had complete data to calculate a CAPRA-S score.  Intervention:   RP.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The main outcome was biochemical recurrence. Performance of CAPRA-S in detecting recurrence was assessed and compared with a validated postoperative nomogram by concordance index (c-index), calibration plots, and decision curve analysis. Prediction of cancer-specific mortality was assessed by Kaplan-Meier analysis and the c-index.  Results and limitations:   The mean age was 62 yr (standard deviation: 6.3), and 34.3% of men had recurrence. The 5-yr progression-free probability for those patients with a CAPRA-S score of 0-2, 3-5, and 6-10 (defining low, intermediate, and high risk) was 72%, 39%, and 17%, respectively. The CAPRA-S c-index was 0.73 in this validation set, compared with a c-index of 0.72 for the Stephenson nomogram. Although CAPRA-S was optimistic in predicting the likelihood of being free of recurrence at 5 yr, it outperformed the Stephenson nomogram on both calibration plots and decision curve analysis. The c-index for predicting cancer-specific mortality was 0.85, with the caveat that this number is based on only 61 events.

A weighted regression model for non-Hispanic whites, Hispanics, and African Americans is used with age-adjusted mortality (2004-2008 data combined) for each county as the dependent variable while independent variables include WI, percentage of the uninsured, and physician supply.  Results:   Higher mortality for breast, female genital system, lung, and all-type cancers is associated with higher WI among non-Hispanic whites and/or African Americans but with lower WI in Hispanics after adjusting for physician supply and percentage of the uninsured. Mortality for all the cancers studied is in the following order from high to low: African Americans, non-Hispanic whites, and Hispanics. Lung cancer mortality is particularly low in Hispanics, which is only 35% of African Americans' mortality and 40% of non-Hispanic whites' mortality.  Conclusions:   Higher degree of socioeconomic deprivation is associated with higher mortality of several cancers among non-Hispanic whites and African Americans, but with lower mortality among Hispanics in Texas. Also, mortality rates of all these cancers studied are the lowest in Hispanics. Further investigations are needed to better understand the mechanisms of the Hispanic Paradox.""","""['Billy U Philips Jr', 'Eric Belasco', 'Kyriakos S Markides', 'Gordon Gong']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Int J Equity Health""","""['Determinants of delayed detection of cancers in Texas counties in the United States of America.', 'Geographic Variations of Racial/Ethnic Disparities in Late-Stage Diagnosis of Childhood Cancer in Texas.', 'Effects of screening mammography on the comparative survival rates of African American, white, and Hispanic beneficiaries of a comprehensive health care system.', 'The influence of socioeconomic disparities on breast cancer tumor biology and prognosis: a review.', 'Differences in cancer incidence, mortality, and survival between African Americans and whites.', 'Social determinants of health and survival on Brazilian patients with glioblastoma: a retrospective analysis of a large populational database.', 'A Novel Prognostic Model for Patients with Primary Gastric Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma.', 'Blood cancer health disparities in the United States Hispanic population.', 'Racial and ethnic differences in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma survival among an underserved, urban population.', 'County-Level Poverty and Barriers to Breast and Cervical Cancer Screening in a Health Education and Patient Navigation Program for Rural and Border Texas Residents.']"""

Surprisingly, attenuation of ERK/MAP kinase signaling by genetic inactivation of Erk2, RNAi-mediated knockdown of ERK1 or ERK2, or MEK inhibitors prevented the activation of the senescence mechanism, allowing oncogenic ras to transform primary cells. Mechanistically, ERK-mediated senescence involved the proteasome-dependent degradation of proteins required for cell cycle progression, mitochondrial functions, cell migration, RNA metabolism, and cell signaling. This senescence-associated protein degradation (SAPD) was observed not only in cells expressing ectopic ras, but also in cells that senesced due to short telomeres. Individual RNAi-mediated inactivation of SAPD targets was sufficient to restore senescence in cells transformed by oncogenic ras or trigger senescence in normal cells. Conversely, the anti-senescence viral oncoproteins E1A, E6, and E7 prevented SAPD. In human prostate neoplasms, high levels of phosphorylated ERK were found in benign lesions, correlating with other senescence markers and low levels of STAT3, one of the SAPD targets.

However, the molecular basis for the oncogenic conversion of TGF-β1 function remains largely undefined. Here, we demonstrate that PPARδ is a direct transcription target of TGF-β1 and plays a critical role in oncogenic redirection of TGF-β1 signaling. Blockade of PPARδ induction enhances tumor cell response to TGF-β1-mediated growth inhibition, while its activation promotes TGF-β1-induced tumor growth, migration and invasion. PPARδ-mediated switch of TGF-β1 function is associated with down- and upregulation of Smad and ERK signaling, respectively, and tightly linked to its function to activate ABCA1 cholesterol transporter followed by caveolin-1 (Cav1) induction. Intriguingly, TGF-β1 activation of the PPARδ-ABCA1-Cav1 pathway facilitates degradation of TGF-β receptors (TβRs) and attenuates Smad but enhances ERK response to TGF-β1. Expression of PPARδ and Cav1 is tightly correlated in both prostate tissues and cell lines and significantly higher in cancer vs. normal tissues.

While cell responses to anticancer drugs are related to their ""mode of action"", it is obvious that some of the drugs used in the previous studies affect the cell cycle. For example, antimicrotubules disable the mitotic apparatus by disrupting the formation or the depolymerisation of microtubules. Cells are thus mostly blocked in the G2/M phase. On the other hand, it has been suggested that the changes observed in the cell spectra due to treatments could be related to the cell cycle. The aim of the present study is to examine this hypothesis and to investigate whether spectral variations induced by a treatment reflect the cell cycle behaviour or the metabolic perturbations induced by the drug. To answer this question, a method was developed that allows an unambiguous identification of the cell cycle phase for each individual cell. This method is based on the superimposition of three types of images: visible, infrared and propidium iodide fluorescence images. Propidium iodide intercalates the bases of the DNA. As the DNA amount in a cell is correlated with the cell cycle phase, the exact phase of each individual cell could be identified. On IR images, mean spectra corresponding to single cells were calculated and associated with the cycle stage defined using fluorescence images. Statistical analyses were applied on these IR spectra, first in order to compare spectra of cells from different stages of the cycle and second, to investigate to what extent the modifications related to the cell cycle contribute to the spectral variations due to paclitaxel treatment. Results demonstrate that the FTIR cell cycle signature is very small with respect to the changes induced by paclitaxel.""","""['Allison Derenne', 'Alix Mignolet', 'Erik Goormaghtigh']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Analyst""","""['The FTIR spectrum of prostate cancer cells allows the classification of anticancer drugs according to their mode of action.', 'Synchrotron FTIR analysis of drug treated ovarian A2780 cells: an ability to differentiate cell response to different drugs?', 'Effects of the confluence rate on the FTIR spectrum of PC-3 prostate cancer cells in culture.', 'Characterization of the hollow fiber assay for the determination of microtubule disruption in vivo.', 'FTIR spectral signature of anticancer drugs.

The aim of this study was to analyse the transcriptional and translational expression patterns of individual subunits of the PP2A holoenzyme during PCa progression.  Methods:   Immunohistochemistry (IHC), western blot, and real-time PCR was performed on androgen-dependent (AD) and androgen-independent (AI) PCa cells, and benign and malignant prostate tissues for all the three PP2A (scaffold, regulatory, and catalytic) subunits. Mechanistic and functional studies were performed using various biochemical and cellular techniques.  Results:   Through immunohistochemical analysis we observed significantly reduced levels of PP2A-A and -B'γ subunits (P<0.001 and P=0.0002) in PCa specimens compared with benign prostate. Contemporarily, there was no significant difference in PP2A-C subunit expression between benign and malignant tissues. Similar to the expression pattern observed in tissues, the endogenous levels of PP2A-A and B'γ subunits were abrogated from the low metastatic to high metastatic and AD to AI cell line models, without any change in the catalytic subunit expression. Furthermore, using in vitro studies we demonstrated that PP2A-Aα scaffold subunit has a role in dampening AKT, β-catenin, and FAK (focal adhesion kinase) signalling.

The reduction of androgen levels can be achieved by the inhibition of 3-oxo-5α-steroid-4-dehydrogenase (5α-reductase), which is responsible for the irreversible conversion of T into its more active metabolite DHT. In fact, the use of 5α-reductase inhibitors (RIs), like finasteride, can be a valuable strategy for the treatment of BPH and in chemoprevention of prostate tumors. In this work a new method based on a dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction (DLLME) procedure, followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), to evaluate the 5α-reductase activity, by measuring the conversion percentage of T into DHT was optimized and validated. Enzymatic assays were carried out in human prostate microsomes, using T as substrate. T and DHT were extracted by the developed DLLME technique and quantified, after silylation, by GC-MS. Variables affecting the extraction efficiency and derivatization of T and DHT were evaluated. The optimized method showed good linearity (with correlation coefficients over 0.9994 for T and 0.9995 for DHT), good recoveries (higher than 80%), and good intra- and inter-day precision (below 13%, 3 levels, n=6). The detection limits for T and DHT were 0.5 nM and the limits of quantification were 5 nM. The new GC-MS method is a good alternative to the already described methods, to evaluate 5α-reductase activity, since it avoids the use of radioactive compounds and corresponds to a fast and sensitive methodology with a good extraction efficiency, accuracy and high recovery. As this method allows the evaluation of 5α-reductase activity, also permits the study of inhibitory efficacy of new molecules as potential RIs.""","""['Cristina Amaral', 'Sara C Cunha', 'José O Fernandes', 'Elisiário Tavares da Silva', 'Fernanda M F Roleira', 'Natércia Teixeira', 'Georgina Correia-da-Silva']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Talanta""","""['New steroidal 17β-carboxy derivatives present anti-5α-reductase activity and anti-proliferative effects in a human androgen-responsive prostate cancer cell line.', 'Effects of competitive and noncompetitive 5α-reductase inhibitors on serum and intra-prostatic androgens in beagle dogs.', 'Validation and application of a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometric method for the simultaneous determination of testosterone and dihydrotestosterone in rat prostatic tissue using a 96-well format.', 'Dihydrotestosterone and the concept of 5alpha-reductase inhibition in human benign prostatic hyperplasia.', '5alpha-reductase activity in the prostate.']"""

Methods and materials:   Patients with low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancer were treated using 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy to a dose of 66 Gy in 22 daily fractions of 3 Gy without hormonal therapy. A uniform 7-mm margin was created around the prostate for the planning target volume, and treatment was prescribed to the isocenter.

However, effects of hydroxytyrosol on prostate cancer are largely unkown. We found that hydroxytyrosol preferentially reduces the viability of human prostate cancer cells (PC-3, DU145) compared to an immortalized non-malignant prostate epithelial cell line (RWPE-1). Exposure of PC-3 cells to 80 µmol/L hydroxytyrosol resulted in significant increases in both superoxide production and activation of apoptosis. These increases were accompanied by mitochondrial dysfunction, defects in autophagy, and activation of MAP kinases. Moreover, N-acetylcysteine (NAC), an efficient reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger, was able to reverse the hydroxytyrosol-induced effects of cell viability loss, defects in autophagy, and activation of apoptosis. This evidence suggests that ROS play a vital role in the loss of PC-3 cell viability. However, MAPK inhibitors including U0126 (for Erk1/2), SB203580 (for p38MAPK) and SP600125 (for JNK) did not decrease hydroxytyrosol-induced growth inhibition, suggesting that these kinases may not be required for the growth inhibitory effect of hydroxytyrosol. Moreover, addition of ROS scavengers (i.e. NAC, catalase, pyruvate, SOD) in the growth media can prevent hydroxytyrosol induced cell viability loss, suggesting that extracellular ROS (superoxide and hydrogen peroxide) facilitate the anti-proliferation effect of hydroxytyrosol in prostate cancer cells. The present work firstly shows that hydroxytyrosol induces apoptotic cell death and mitochondrial dysfunction by generating superoxide in PC-3 cells.

Adjusting for potential confounders, we used regression models to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and hazard ratios (HRs) for prostate cancer according to fish and fish oil consumption.  Results:   Among the 2268 men, we ascertained 214 prevalent and 133 incident prostate cancer cases, of which 63 had advanced disease. High fish consumption in early- and midlife was not associated with overall or advanced prostate cancer. High intake of salted or smoked fish was associated with a 2-fold increased risk of advanced prostate cancer both in early life (95% CI: 1.08, 3.62) and in later life (95% CI: 1.04, 5.00). Men consuming fish oil in later life had a lower risk of advanced prostate cancer [HR (95%CI): 0.43 (0.19, 0.95)], no association was found for early life or midlife consumption.  Conclusions:   Salted or smoked fish may increase risk of advanced prostate cancer, whereas fish oil consumption may be protective against progression of prostate cancer in elderly men. In a setting with very high fish consumption, no association was found between overall fish consumption in early or midlife and prostate cancer risk.""","""['Johanna E Torfadottir', 'Unnur A Valdimarsdottir', 'Lorelei A Mucci', 'Julie L Kasperzyk', 'Katja Fall', 'Laufey Tryggvadottir', 'Thor Aspelund', 'Orn Olafsson', 'Tamara B Harris', 'Eirikur Jonsson', 'Hrafn Tulinius', 'Vilmundur Gudnason', 'Hans-Olov Adami', 'Meir Stampfer', 'Laufey Steingrimsdottir']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Re: consumption of fish products across the lifespan and prostate cancer risk.', 'Rye bread consumption in early life and reduced risk of advanced prostate cancer.', 'Fish and fish-liver oil consumption in adolescence and midlife and risk of CHD in older women.', 'Re: consumption of fish products across the lifespan and prostate cancer risk.', 'Dietary factors and risk for advanced prostate cancer.', 'Fish-Derived Omega-3 Fatty Acids and Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review.', 'Evidence on Statins, Omega-3, and Prostate Cancer: A Narrative Review.', 'Factors that Influence 2-Year Progression-Free Survival Among Head and Neck Cancer Patients.', 'Adolescent animal product intake in relation to later prostate cancer risk and mortality in the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study.', 'Omega-3 Fatty Acids Survey in Men under Active Surveillance for Prostate Cancer: from Intake to Prostate Tissue Level.', 'Dietary intake is associated with risk of multiple myeloma and its precursor disease.']"""

Patients, materials and methods:   A prospective study 168 unscreened men who were referred for evaluation for CaP. They all had a 10-core extended transrectal prostatic needle biopsy using size 16 Tru Cut needle for either an elevated serum total PSA of > 4 ng/ml or abnormal DRE findings or both. Overall cancer detection rate was determined and detection rates were determined separately for patients with elevated PSA with normal DRE, abnormal DRE with normal PSA and those with both indications. The performances of each indication were determined separately and in combination in terms of their sensitivity, specificity, predictive values and accuracy. The results were compared amongst patients with different indications for biopsy.  Results:   The overall cancer detection rate was 44.0%. Detection rates in patients with elevated PSA with normal DRE and abnormal DRE with normal PSA were 30.0% and 17.4% respectively. There was statistically significant increased detection of 61.2% amongst patients with both indications. The overall sensitivities of PSA, DRE and combination of both were 94.6%, 75.7% and 70.3% respectively while the specificities were 20.2%, 44.7% and 64.9% respectively. The accuracies of PSA, DRE and combination of both indications were 53%, 58% and 67.3% respectively while the PPVs were 48.3%, 51.9% and 61.2% respectively.

Objective:   The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate cancer incidence in responders during the first 7 years after 11 September 2001.  Methods:   Cancers among 20,984 consented participants in the WTC Health Program were identified through linkage to state tumor registries in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, and Pennsylvania. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were calculated to compare cancers diagnosed in responders to predicted numbers for the general population. Multivariate regression models were used to estimate associations with degree of exposure.  Results:   A total of 575 cancers were diagnosed in 552 individuals. Increases above registry-based expectations were noted for all cancer sites combined (SIR = 1.15; 95% CI: 1.06, 1.25), thyroid cancer (SIR = 2.39; 95% CI: 1.70, 3.27), prostate cancer (SIR = 1.21; 95% CI: 1.01, 1.44), combined hematopoietic and lymphoid cancers (SIR = 1.36; 95% CI: 1.07, 1.71), and soft tissue cancers (SIR = 2.26; 95% CI: 1.13, 4.05). When restricted to 302 cancers diagnosed ≥ 6 months after enrollment, the SIR for all cancers decreased to 1.06 (95% CI: 0.94, 1.18), but thyroid and prostate cancer diagnoses remained greater than expected. All cancers combined were increased in very highly exposed responders and among those exposed to significant amounts of dust, compared with responders who reported lower levels of exposure.  Conclusion:   Estimates should be interpreted with caution given the short follow-up and long latency period for most cancers, the intensive medical surveillance of this cohort, and the small numbers of cancers at specific sites.

Methods:   Within a cohort of 6,692 men followed up after a biopsy or transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) with benign findings, a nested case-control study was conducted of 494 prostate cancer cases and controls matched on age, race, follow-up duration, biopsy versus TURP and date of procedure. Body mass index at the time of the initial procedure was abstracted from medical records, and initial biopsy specimens were reviewed for the presence of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN).  Results:   Obesity was associated with the presence of PIN in the initial benign specimen [OR = 2.15; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.13-4.11]. After adjustment for the matching variables, family history of prostate cancer, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels at the initial procedure, the number of PSA tests and digital rectal examinations during follow-up, obesity (OR = 1.57; 95% CI, 1.07-2.30) at the time of the initial procedure was associated with prostate cancer incidence during follow-up.

These nanoparticles are suitable for the optical detection of an enzyme and have the potential for application as a drug delivery system. Two different peptide sequences, one cleaved by trypsin (GFF), the other by hepsin (RQLRVVGG), a protease overexpressed in early stages of prostate cancer, are used as the central part of the triblock. For optical detection a fluorophore-quencher pair is introduced around the cleavage sequence. The solid phase synthesis is conduced such that two identical sequences are synthesized from one branching point. Eventually, carboxy-terminated polystyrene is introduced into the peptide synthesizer and coupled to the amino-termini of the branched sequence. Upon cleavage, a fragment is released from the triblock copolymer, which has the potential for use in drug delivery applications. Conducting the whole synthesis on a solid phase in the peptide synthesizer avoids solubility issues and post-synthetic purification steps. Due to the hydrophobic PS-chains, the copolymer can easily be formulated to form nanoparticles using a nanoprecipitation process. Incubation of the nanoparticles with the respective enzymes leads to a significant increase of the fluorescence from the incorporated fluorophore, thereby indicating cleavage of the peptide sequence and decomposition of the particles.""","""['Adrian V Fuchs', 'Niklas Kotman', 'Julien Andrieu', 'Volker Mailänder', 'Clemens K Weiss', 'Katharina Landfester']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Nanoscale""","""['Facile synthesis of polyester-PEG triblock copolymers and preparation of amphiphilic nanoparticles as drug carriers.', 'Intermolecular interaction and morphology investigation of drug loaded ABA-triblock copolymers with different hydrophilic/lipophilic ratios.', 'Catalytic peptide synthesis by trypsin modified with polystyrene in chloroform.', 'Synthesis, self-assembly, and in vitro doxorubicin release behavior of dendron-like/linear/dendron-like poly(epsilon-caprolactone)-b-poly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly(epsilon-caprolactone) triblock copolymers.', 'Controllable core-shell-type resin for solid-phase peptide synthesis.', 'Biocompatible Coatings from Smart Biopolymer Nanoparticles for Enzymatically Induced Drug Release.', 'Functional superhydrophobic surfaces made of Janus micropillars.', 'Nanoparticles from renewable polymers.']"""

However, without radiation, it still significantly drove its expression. To suppress expression while retaining its enhancement in response to radiation, we focused our attention on microRNAs (miRNAs). miRNAs are a group of non-coding RNAs approximately 22 nucleotides long that control gene expression by binding to a target sequence residing on the 3'-untranslated region (3'UTR) of a target gene. We identified 8 miRNAs that were downregulated in response to X-ray irradiation, and inserted artificial target sequences composed of randomly combined complementary sequences into 3 representative miRNAs into the 3'UTR of the luciferase gene.

In this study, we report that norcantharidin (NCTD) induces the degradation of Cdc6 in DU145 PCa cells and as a result, the assembly of pre-replication complexes (pre-RCs) was disturbed and DNA replication was inhibited. Furthermore, treatment with NCTD blocked ATR binding to chromatin and the cells progressed into mitosis under stress induced by hydroxyurea (HU), indicating that the ATR checkpoint was evaded. Aberrant mitosis and hence, apoptosis were also observed following treatment with NCTD. Finally, NCTD exerted strong synergistic cytotoxic effects in combination with another mitotic inhibitor, paclitaxel, [combination index (CI <1)]. These data suggest that NCTD not only inhibits DNA replication but also disables the ATR-dependent checkpoint pathway by inducing Cdc6 degradation, which leads to mitotic catastrophe in DU145 cells.

Methods:   The study population included 35,958 men aged 40+ years, with no prior diagnosis of prostate cancer, enrolled in 31 general practices in the Midland Cancer Network Region of New Zealand in 2010. Computerized practice records were searched for information, including reasons for testing, for men with elevated PSA test results in 2010. PSA results for 2007-2010 were obtained from community laboratories. Screened men were identified and screening rates calculated by age.  Results:   Of 9344 men who underwent one or more PSA tests in 2010, 84.9% were classified as having been screened. The overall screening rate was 22.1%, with 24.4% of men aged 70+ years screened. Elevated PSA levels were found in 2.1% of screened men. Of the men screened in 2010, 57.3% had had a screening test in the previous three years.

This study investigated whether prostate cancer is associated with prostatitis, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and other medical conditions in the low-incidence population.  Methods:   From the claims data obtained from the universal National Health Insurance of Taiwan, we identified 1184 patients with prostate cancer diagnosed from 1997 to 2008. Controls comprised 4736 men randomly selected from a cancer-free population. Both groups were 50 years of age or above. Medical histories between the two groups were compared.  Results:   Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that prostatitis and BPH had stronger association with prostate cancer than the other medical conditions tested. Compared with men without prostatitis and BPH, a higher odds ratio (OR) for prostate cancer was associated with BPH (26.2, 95% confidence interval (CI) 20.8-33.0) than with prostatitis (10.5, 95% CI=3.36-32.7). Men with both conditions had an OR of 49.2 (95% CI=34.7-69.9).  Conclusion:   Men with prostate cancer have strong association with prostatitis and/or BPH.

This study examined treatment effects in more comparable groups.  Methods:   From 2008-2011, 240 patients with localised prostate cancer were selected to be eligible for both radical prostatectomy (RP) and external beam radiotherapy (EBRT). Brachytherapy (BT) was a third option for some. Health-related quality of life was measured by expanded prostate cancer index composite (EPIC) up to 12 months after treatment.  Results:   In the sexual domain, RP led to worse summary scores (P<0.001) and more often to a clinically relevant deterioration from baseline than BT and EBRT (79%, 33%, 34%, respectively). In the urinary domain, RP also led to worse summary scores (P=0.014), and more deterioration from baseline (41%, 12%, 19%, respectively). Only on the irritative/obstructive urinary scale, more BT patients (40%) showed a relevant deterioration than RP (17%) and EBRT patients (11%). In the bowel domain, the treatment effects did not differ.  Conclusion:   This study provides a more unbiased comparison of treatment effects, as men were more comparable at baseline.

So far, there is no consensus regarding the optimum PID method, though the latest literature is in favor of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This study aims to simultaneously compare 3 PID techniques: (1) MRI-computed tomography (CT) fusion; (2) ultrasound (US)-CT fusion; and (3) manual target delineation on CT. The study comprised 10 patients with prostate cancer. CT/MR scans with urinary catheters in place for PID were done either on day 0 or day 1 postimplantation. The main parameter evaluated and compared among methods was target D90. The results show that CT-based D90s are lower than US-CT D90s (median difference,-6.85%), whereas MR-CT PID gives higher D90 than US-CT PID (median difference, 4.25%). Manual contouring on CT images tends to overestimate the prostate volume compared with transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) (median difference, 23.33%), whereas on US images the target is overestimated compared with MR-based contouring (median difference, 13.25%). Although there are certain differences among the results given by various PID techniques, the differences are statistically insignificant for this small group of patients. Any dosimetric comparison between 2 PID techniques should also account for the limitations of each technique, to allow for an accurate quantification of data.

Patients and methods:   We examined survivors of adult cancers from the 2010 National Health Interview Survey (N = 1,777). Multivariable logistic regression models examined factors associated with receipt of and satisfaction with psychosocial care.  Results:   Most survivors (55.1%) reported neither provider discussions nor use of PCSG; 31.4% reported provider discussion only, 4.4% reported use of PCSG only, and 8.9% reported both.

Methods:   CNAs in tumor DNA samples from 125 patients in the discovery cohort who underwent prostatectomy were assayed with high-resolution Affymetrix 6.0 single-nucleotide polymorphism microarrays and then analyzed using the Genomic Identification of Significant Targets in Cancer (GISTIC) algorithm.  Results:   The assays revealed 20 significant regions of CNAs, 4 of them novel, and identified the target genes of 4 of the alterations. By univariate analysis, 7 CNAs were significantly associated with early PCa-specific mortality. These included gains of chromosomal regions that contain the genes MYC, ADAR, or TPD52 and losses of sequences that incorporate SERPINB5, USP10, PTEN, or TP53. On multivariate analysis, only the CNAs of PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog) and MYC (v-myc myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog) contributed additional prognostic information independent of that provided by pathologic stage, Gleason score, and initial prostate-specific antigen level. Patients whose tumors had alterations of both genes had a markedly elevated risk of PCa-specific mortality (odds ratio = 53; 95% CI = 6.92-405, P = 1 × 10(-4)). Analyses of 333 tumors from 3 additional distinct patient cohorts confirmed the relationship between CNAs of PTEN and MYC and lethal PCa.

We found the expression of testicular nuclear receptor 4 (TR4) is significantly higher in PCa CD133(+) stem/progenitor cells compared with CD133(-) non-stem/progenitor cells. Knockdown of TR4 levels in the established PCa stem/progenitor cells and the CD133(+) population of the C4-2 PCa cell line with lentiviral TR4 siRNA led to increased drug sensitivity to the two commonly used chemotherapeutic drugs, docetaxel and etoposide, judging from significantly reduced IC50 values and increased apoptosis in the TR4 knockdown cells. Mechanism dissection studies found that suppression of TR4 in these stem/progenitor cells led to down-regulation of Oct4 expression, which, in turn, down-regulated the IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL1Ra) expression.

MAZ (Myc-associated zinc-finger protein) is a transcription factor that regulates the transcription of oncogenes, and the deregulated MAZ expression is closely related to the development and progression of a variety of cancers. In the present study, the role of MAZ in PCa tumorigenesis and its interaction with androgen receptor (AR), which is essential to PCa development in humans, were investigated. MAZ expression was found to be higher in clinical PCa specimens than in benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and adjacent normal tissues, and MAZ expression was positively correlated with AR expression, which was also observed in PCa cell lines. After knockdown of MAZ by siRNA, cell proliferation was notably inhibited, colony formation declined, the cell cycle was arrested at G0/G1 phase, and the number of cells in S phase decreased (p < 0.05). MAZ knockdown resulted in a significant decline in the migration and invasion capacity of the LNCaP-AD cell line. siRNA knockdown of AR significantly decreased MAZ expression, and knockdown of MAZ significantly increased the expression of AR and DHT-induced androgen response element (ARE). These results suggest that MAZ and AR are interrelated and that MAZ plays an important role in PCa pathogenesis, which could be a potential therapeutic target.""","""['Li Jiao', 'Yun Li', 'Dan Shen', 'Chuanliang Xu', 'Linhui Wang', 'Gang Huang', 'Lin Chen', 'Yinhui Yang', 'Chun Yang', 'Yongwei Yu', 'Yinghao Sun']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Med Oncol""","""['MAZ promotes prostate cancer bone metastasis through transcriptionally activating the KRas-dependent RalGEFs pathway.', 'Androgen receptor as a regulator of ZEB2 expression and its implications in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in prostate cancer.', 'CA916798 affects growth and metastasis of androgen-dependent prostate cancer cells.', 'SIRT7 depletion inhibits cell proliferation and androgen-induced autophagy by suppressing the AR signaling in prostate cancer.', 'Roles of Myc-associated zinc finger protein in malignant tumors.', 'TBK1 promotes thyroid cancer progress by activating the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway.', 'PCGF6/MAX/KDM5D facilitates MAZ/CDK4 axis expression and pRCC progression by hypomethylation of the DNA promoter.', 'Plasma and urinary extracellular vesicles as a source of RNA biomarkers for prostate cancer in liquid biopsies.', 'Identification and Somatic Characterization of the Germline PTEN Promoter Variant rs34149102 in a Family with Gastrointestinal and Breast Tumors.', 'Myc-associated zinc-finger protein promotes clear cell renal cell carcinoma progression through transcriptional activation of the MAP2K2-dependent ERK pathway.']"""

Magnetic resonance imaging/transrectal ultrasound fusion has shown encouraging results for detecting clinically significant prostate cancer. We critically evaluated magnetic resonance imaging targeted, transrectal ultrasound guided transperineal fusion biopsy in routine clinical practice.  Materials and methods:   Included in this prospective study were 347 consecutive patients with findings suspicious for prostate cancer. Median age was 65 years (range 42 to 84) and mean prostate specific antigen was 9.85 ng/ml (range 0.5 to 104). Of the men 49% previously underwent transrectal ultrasound guided biopsies, which were negative, and 51% underwent primary biopsy. In all patients 3 Tesla multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging was done. Systematic stereotactic prostate biopsies plus magnetic resonance imaging targeted, transrectal ultrasound guided biopsies were performed in those with abnormalities on magnetic resonance imaging. Imaging data and biopsy results were analyzed. A self-designed questionnaire was sent to all men on further clinical history and biopsy adverse effects.  Results:   Of 347 patients biopsy samples of 200 (58%) showed prostate cancer and 73.5% of biopsy proven prostate cancer were clinically relevant according to National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) criteria. On multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging 104 men had findings highly suspicious for prostate cancer. The tumor detection rate was 82.6% (86 of 104 men) with a Gleason score of 7 or greater in 72%. Overall targeted cores detected significantly more cancer than systematic biopsies (30% vs 8.2%). Of 94 patients without cancer suspicious lesions on magnetic resonance imaging 11 (11.7%) were diagnosed with intermediate risk disease. Regarding adverse effects, 152 of 300 patients (50.6%) reported mild hematuria, 26% had temporary erectile dysfunction and 2.6% needed short-term catheterization after biopsy. Nonseptic febrile urinary tract infections developed in 3 patients (1%).  Conclusions:   Magnetic resonance imaging targeted, transrectal ultrasound guided transperineal fusion biopsy provides high detection of clinically significant tumors. Since multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging still has some limitations, systematic biopsies should currently not be omitted.

We circumferentially performed 16 periurethral core bench biopsies on each radical prostatectomy specimen to evaluate the extent of periurethral inflammatory infiltrate and collagen and elastin amount. The clinical and urodynamic findings and the collagen and elastin periurethral amount in patients with or without inflammation were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test and the Pearson χ(2) test.

DR has been found to occur in up to 53% of patients treated for localized prostate cancer, and it may vary depending on treatment modality. DR after modern dose-escalated radiation therapy (DE-RT) has not been investigated previously, to our knowledge. Our primary aim was to evaluate DR in a cohort of patients treated with DE-RT.  Methods and materials:   We surveyed 257 consecutive patients with localized prostate cancer who had previously received DE-RT, by means of a validated questionnaire.  Results:   There were 220 responses (85.6% response rate). Image-guided intensity modulated radiation therapy was given in 85.0% of patients and 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy in 15.0%. Doses received included 73.8 Gy (34.5% patients), 74 Gy (53.6%), and 76 Gy (10.9%). Neoadjuvant androgen deprivation (AD) was given in 51.8% of patients and both neoadjuvant and adjuvant AD in 34.5%. The median follow-up time was 23 months (range, 12-67 months). In all, 3.8% of patients expressed DR for their choice of treatment. When asked whether they would choose DE-RT or AD again, only 0.5% probably or definitely would not choose DE-RT again, compared with 8.4% for AD (P<.01).  Conclusion:   Few patients treated with modern DE-RT express DR, with regret appearing to be lower than in previously published reports of patients treated with radical prostatectomy or older radiation therapy techniques. Patients experienced more regret with the AD component of treatment than with the radiation therapy component, with implications for informed consent.

Cine MV images acquisition was scheduled for single or multiple treatment fractions (between 1 and 8). A novel automatic fiducial detection algorithm that can handle irregular multileaf collimator apertures, field edges, fast leaf and gantry movement, and MV image noise and artifacts in patient anatomy was used. All sets of images (approximately 25,000 images in total) were analyzed to measure the positioning accuracy of implanted fiducial markers and assess the prostate movement.  Results:   Prostate motion can vary greatly in magnitude among different patients. Different motion patterns were identified, showing its unpredictability. The mean displacement and standard deviation of the intrafraction motion was generally less than 2.0 ± 2.0 mm in each of the spatial directions. In certain patients, however, the percentage of the treatment time in which the prostate is displaced more than 5 mm from its planned position in at least 1 spatial direction was 10% or more. The maximum prostate displacement observed was 13.3 mm.  Conclusion:   Prostate tracking and motion assessment was performed with MV imaging and an EPID.

For this study, 338 patients with idiopathic oligozoospermia or azoospermia and 382 fertile controls were recruited from an infertility clinic. Semen analysis was performed by computer-assisted semen analysis system. The functional polymorphism of MSMB gene was genotyped using TaqMan method. Sixty three seminal plasma samples were used to test the expression of MSMB by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The TT genotype and T allele were associated with an increased risk of idiopathic infertility with azoospermia (TT genotype: OR, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.03-2.95; T allele: OR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.03-1.75). However, no differences were found in risk for the TT genotype or T allele among men with oligozoospermia. In addition, idiopathic infertile males have significantly higher MSMB expression levels than fertile controls. We present the first epidemiologic evidence supporting the involvement of common genetic polymorphism in MSMB gene in spermatogenic failure.

Methods:   We performed a meta-analysis of relevant randomized controlled trials identified in Pubmed, Embase, and Cochrane databases. Abstracts presented at the conferences were also searched. Overall incidence rates, relative risk (RR), and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) were calculated employing fixed- or random-effects models depending on the heterogeneity of the included trials.  Results:   A total of 8963 patients with a variety of solid tumors from 7 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included for the meta-analysis. The overall incidence of ONJ in cancer patients receiving denosumab was 1.7 % [95 % CI: 0.9-3.1 %]. Also, the use of denosumab was associated with significantly increased risk of ONJ in comparison with bisphosphonates (BPs)/placebo treatment (RR 1.61, 95 % CI: 1.05-2.48, P = 0.029).

In the development of targeted PDT agents, a simple evaluation system of in vivo pharmacokinetics, as well as target cell uptake, is absolutely imperative. We hypothesized that (64)Cu chelation with porphyrin photosensitizer-biomacromolecule conjugates may become a simple and versatile labeling strategy for this purpose.  Methods:   Protoporphyrin IX (PPIX) and a bombesin (BBN) analog, that interacts with the gastrin-released peptide (GRP) receptor, were used as a photosensitizer and tumor-targeting peptide, respectively. Then, a conjugate of PPIX and BBN analog linked via short polyethylene glycol (PPIX-PEG6-BBN analog) was synthesized and used as a targeted PDT agent. In addition, a (64)Cu-chelated PPIX-PEG6-BBN analog was synthesized under optimized reaction conditions. Lastly, cell uptake study and PET image-based pharmacokinetic analyses of the PPIX-PEG6-BBN analog were carried out in a human prostate cancer cell line, PC-3, which highly expresses the GRP receptor, and PC-3 tumor-bearing mice.  Results:   It was confirmed that degradation (thought to be based on radiolysis) occurs, and large amounts of (64)Cu-labeling compounds are wasted in the reaction mixture. Interestingly, the addition of ethanol into the reaction mixture provides an effective solution for this problem. As for cell uptake study, the [(64)Cu]PPIX-PEG6-BBN analog demonstrated significantly higher uptake for PC-3 cells than [(64)Cu]PPIX and, in addition, the uptake of [(64)Cu]PPIX-PEG6-BBN analog was significantly inhibited by adding excess cold BBN analog peptide. PET image-based pharmacokinetic evaluation revealed that [(64)Cu]PPIX-PEG6-BBN analog and [(64)Cu]PPIX rapidly accumulate into the liver and kidney, circulate in blood for a long time compared with normal peptides, and distribute at a low level in the tumor. This result suggested that in vivo biodistribution of PPIX-PEG6-BBN analog is mainly dependent on the lipophilicity of PPIX. Ex vivo measurements of radioactivity distribution after PET studies showed that although there was no remarkable difference in the tumor/skin ratio of radioactivity between [(64)Cu]PPIX-PEG6-BBN analog and [(64)Cu]PPIX, the pancreas (an organ that also expresses GRP receptors)/skin ratio was significantly higher in the case of [(64)Cu]PPIX-PEG6-BBN analog.  Conclusion:   We report on the successful synthesis of (64)Cu-chelated porphyrin photosensitizers and their tumor-targeting peptide conjugates under conditions in which radiolysis is suppressed. This labeling strategy with porphyrin photosensitizers may be of value for the rapid development of ideal targeted PDT agents.""","""['Hidefumi Mukai', 'Yasuhiro Wada', 'Yasuyoshi Watanabe']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Ann Nucl Med""","""['Optimization, biological evaluation and microPET imaging of copper-64-labeled bombesin agonists, 64Cu-NO2A-(X)-BBN(7-14)NH2, in a prostate tumor xenografted mouse model.', 'Novel radiolabeled peptides for breast and prostate tumor PET imaging: (64)Cu/and (68)Ga/NOTA-PEG-D-Tyr(6),βAla(11),Thi(13),Nle(14)BBN(6-14).', 'Evaluation of 64Cu-labeled bifunctional chelate-bombesin conjugates.', '64Cu-1,4,7-Triazacyclononane-1,4-diacetic acid-9-aminonanoic acid-Gln-Trp-Ala-Val-Gly-His-Leu-Met-NH2.', '64Cu-1,4,7-Triazacyclononane-1,4-diacetic acid-6-aminohexanoic acid-Gln-Trp-Ala-Val-Gly-His-Leu-Met-NH2.', 'Increasing Reaction Rates of Water-Soluble Porphyrins for 64Cu Radiopharmaceutical Labeling.', 'Porphyrins as Chelating Agents for Molecular Imaging in Nuclear Medicine.', 'Distinctive detection of insulinoma using 18FFB(ePEG12)12-exendin-4 PET/CT.', 'Macrocyclic peptide-based inhibition and imaging of hepatocyte growth factor.', 'Porphyrins as ligands for 64copper: background and trends.']"""

Few reports emphasized the role of chemotherapy in the management of early stage prostate cancer. This study analyzed the safety and efficacy of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) plus chemotherapy as initial treatment for patients identified as local failures or not eligible for prostatectomy or radiation therapy due to advanced disease presentation.  Methods:   Enrolled patients received ADT in the form of leuprolide every 12 weeks for 24 months with bicalutamide initiating after the completion of chemotherapy. Chemotherapy consisted of ketoconazole and doxorubicin for weeks 1, 3, and 5 and estramustine and docetaxel and for weeks 2, 4 and 6. During weeks 7 and 8, no treatment was received.  Results:   Forty-six patients were enrolled, and forty-five patients were evaluable. Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 23.4 months. Median overall survival (OS) was 53.7 months.

Patients and methods:   Between May 2007 and December 2009, 95 patients with a total of 118 lesions underwent CBK-SRT (median dose 24 Gy in 3 fractions).  Inclusion criteria:   adult patients with limited volume cancer; suitability for SRT but not for other local therapies. Primary diagnoses included breast, lung, head and neck, gastrointestinal and other malignancies. Prostate cancer patients were excluded. Concomitant systemic therapy was given in 40 % of cases and median follow-up was 12 months. Toxicity and tumor response were evaluated using the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group/European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (RTOG/EORTC) Scale and Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors RECIST.  Results:   Toxicity was rare and observed mainly in patients with comorbidities or uncontrolled cancer. Out of 87 evaluable lesions, complete radiological response, partial response, stabilization and progressive disease were observed in 15 (17 %), 25 (29 %), 34 (39 %) and 13 (15 %) lesions, respectively. Upon restricting the analysis to lesions treated with CBK-SRT alone (no concomitant therapy), response- and local control (LC) rates remained similar.

Patients and methods:   Patients undergoing postprostatectomy RT for prostate-specific antigen (PSA) relapse or high-risk disease were enrolled in the study. Under transrectal ultrasound guidance, three fine gold markers were implanted in the prostate bed and the technical difficulties of insertion were documented. Patients received our self-designed questionnaires concerning complications and pain. The influence of anticoagulants and coumarins on bleeding was analyzed, as was the effect of potential risk factors on pain.  Results:   In 77 consecutive patients, failure of marker implantation or marker migration was seen in six cases. Rectal bleeding was reported by 10 patients and 1 had voiding complaints. No macroscopic hematuria persisting for more than 3 days was observed.

Targeting AR remains a focal point for designing new strategy of PCa therapy. Here, we have shown that DAB2IP, a novel tumor suppressor in PCa, can inhibit AR-mediated cell growth and gene activation in PCa cells via distinct mechanisms. DAB2IP inhibits the genomic pathway by preventing AR nuclear translocation or phosphorylation and suppresses the non-genomic pathway via its unique functional domain to inactivate c-Src. Also, DAB2IP is capable of suppressing AR activation in an androgen-independent manner. In addition, DAB2IP can inhibit several AR splice variants showing constitutive activity in PCa cells. In DAB2IP(-/-) mice, the prostate gland exhibits hyperplastic epithelia, in which AR becomes more active. Consistently, DAB2IP expression inversely correlates with AR activation status particularly in recurrent or metastatic PCa patients. Taken together, DAB2IP is a unique intrinsic AR modulator in normal cells, and likely can be further developed into a therapeutic agent for PCa.""","""['K Wu', 'J Liu', 'S-F Tseng', 'C Gore', 'Z Ning', 'N Sharifi', 'L Fazli', 'M Gleave', 'P Kapur', 'G Xiao', 'X Sun', 'O K Oz', 'W Min', 'G Alexandrakis', 'C-R Yang', 'C-L Hsieh', 'H-C Wu', 'D He', 'D Xie', 'J-T Hsieh']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['DAB2IP loss confers the resistance of prostate cancer to androgen deprivation therapy through activating STAT3 and inhibiting apoptosis.', 'Changes in androgen receptor nongenotropic signaling correlate with transition of LNCaP cells to androgen independence.', 'Oncogenic herpesvirus HHV-8 promotes androgen-independent prostate cancer growth.', 'Oxidative stress and androgen receptor signaling in the development and progression of castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'A sting in the tail: the N-terminal domain of the androgen receptor as a drug target.', 'The Tumor Suppressor DAB2IP Is Regulated by Cell Contact and Contributes to YAP/TAZ Inhibition in Confluent Cells.', 'Cypermethrin inhibits proliferation of Sertoli cells through AR involving DAB2IP/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in vitro.', 'DOC-2/DAB2 interactive protein destabilizes c-Myc to impair the growth and self-renewal of colon tumor-repopulating cells.', 'The AKR1C3/AR-V7 complex maintains CRPC tumour growth by repressing B4GALT1 expression.', 'miR-431 Promotes Metastasis of Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors by Targeting DAB2 Interacting Protein, a Ras GTPase Activating Protein Tumor Suppressor.']"""

In this study, tumor hyperthermia was utilized as a means to increase the active delivery of heat shock protein (HSP) targeted N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide (HPMA) copolymer-drug conjugates. Following hyperthermia, induced expression of cell surface heat shock protein (HSP) glucose regulated protein 78 kDa (GRP78) was utilized for targeted drug therapy. Conjugates bearing the anticancer agents aminohexylgeldanamycin (AHGDM), docetaxel (DOC), or cisplatin and the GRP78 targeting peptide WDLAWMFRLPVG were synthesized and characterized. Binding to cell surface expressed heat shock protein GRP78 on the surface of human prostate cancer DU145 cells was evaluated. HSP targeted AHGDM and DOC conjugates demonstrated active binding comparable to native targeting peptide. They were then assessed in vitro for the ability to synergistically induce cytotoxicity in combination with moderate hyperthermia (43 °C, 30 min). HSP targeted DOC conjugates exhibited high potency against DU145 cells with an IC₅₀ of 2.4 nM. HSP targeted AHGDM and DOC conjugates demonstrated synergistic effects in combination with hyperthermia with combination index values of 0.65 and 0.45 respectively. Based on these results, HSP targeted DOC conjugates were selected for in vivo evaluation. In DU145 tumor bearing mice, a single treatment of tumor hyperthermia, induced via gold nanorod mediated plasmonic photothermal therapy, and intravenous administration of HSP targeted HPMA copolymer-docetaxel at 10mg/kg resulted in maintained tumor regression for a period of 30 days. These results demonstrate the potential for tumor hyperthermia to increase the delivery of HSP targeted macromolecular chemotherapeutics.""","""['Nate Larson', 'Adam Gormley', 'Nick Frazier', 'Hamidreza Ghandehari']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Control Release""","""['Enhanced efficacy of combination heat shock targeted polymer therapeutics with high intensity focused ultrasound.', 'In vitro synergistic action of geldanamycin- and docetaxel-containing HPMA copolymer-RGDfK conjugates against ovarian cancer.', 'HPMA copolymer-aminohexylgeldanamycin conjugates targeting cell surface expressed GRP78 in prostate cancer.', 'Polymer decorated gold nanoparticles in nanomedicine conjugates.', 'HPMA copolymer-cyclic RGD conjugates for tumor targeting.', 'Progress in Polymeric Nano-Medicines for Theranostic Cancer Treatment.', 'Responsive Hybrid (Poly)peptide-Polymer Conjugates.', 'Enhanced efficacy of combination heat shock targeted polymer therapeutics with high intensity focused ultrasound.', 'Hyperthermia enhances 17-DMAG efficacy in hepatocellular carcinoma cells with aggravated DNA damage and impaired G2/M transition.', 'Comparative effect of gold nanorods and nanocages for prostate tumor hyperthermia.']"""

AE105 is a small linear peptide with high binding affinity to uPAR. We synthesized an N-terminal NOTA-conjugated version (NOTA-AE105) for development of the first (18)F-labeled uPAR positron-emission-tomography PET ligand using the Al(18)F radiolabeling method. In this study, the potential of (18)F-AlF-NOTA-AE105 to specifically target uPAR-positive prostate tumors was investigated.  Methods:   NOTA-conjugated AE105 was synthesized and radiolabeled with (18)F-AlF according to a recently published optimized protocol. The labeled product was purified by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography RP-HPLC. The tumor targeting properties were evaluated in mice with subcutaneously inoculated PC-3 xenografts using small animal PET and ex vivo biodistribution studies. uPAR-binding specificity was studied by coinjection of an excess of a uPAR antagonist peptide AE105 analogue (AE152).  Results:   NOTA-AE105 was labeled with (18)F-AlF in high radiochemical purity (>92%) and yield (92.7%) and resulted in a specific activity of greater than 20GBq/μmol. A high and specific tumor uptake was found. At 1h post injection, the uptake of (18)F-AlF-NOTA-AE105 in PC-3 tumors was 4.22 ± 0.13%ID/g. uPAR-binding specificity was demonstrated by a reduced uptake of (18)F-AlF-NOTA-AE105 after coinjection of a blocking dose of uPAR antagonist at all three time points investigated. Good tumor-to-background ratio was observed with small animal PET and confirmed in the biodistribution analysis. Ex vivo uPAR expression analysis on extracted tumors confirmed human uPAR expression that correlated close with tumor uptake of (18)F-AlF-NOTA-AE105.  Conclusion:   The first (18)F-labeled uPAR PET ligand, (18)F-AlF-NOTA-AE105, has successfully been prepared and effectively visualized noninvasively uPAR positive prostate cancer.

Apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in human tissues were assessed by immunohistochemical detection of Bcl2 and p21, respectively. Growth inhibition and apoptosis treatment with naftopidil and tamsulosin were assessed in cancer cell lines. Interference with transforming growth factor-β signaling was examined by western blot analysis.  Results:   Prostate cancer incidence was significantly lower in men who received naftopidil for 3 months or longer compared with tamsulosin (P = 0.035). Multivariate analysis confirmed a decreased hazard ratio, 0.46, for naftopidil use (P = 0.013), which was more evident with longer treatment. Immunohistochemical positivity for Bcl2, a marker for resistance to apoptosis, was less frequently detected in prostate cancer cells of men who received naftopidil compared with tamsulosin (P < 0.05). Naftopidil inhibited cancer cell growth, induced apoptosis and blocked Smad2 phosphorylation activated by transforming growth factor-β in cell lines, with a half maximal inhibitory concentration of 1.1 µmol/L.

Patients with metastatic castration-resistant PCA that does not respond to treatment with docetaxel have few therapeutic options. The OCT4-expressing PCA cells selected using the EOS system showed increased tumorigenicity and high resistance to docetaxel, both in vitro and in vivo. By using their gene expression data, expression signature-based prediction for compound candidates identified an antiviral drug, ribavirin, as a conversion modulator from drug resistance to sensitivity. Treatment of PCA cells with ribavirin decreased their resistance against treatment with docetaxel. This indicated that ribavirin reversed the gene expression, including that of humoral factors, in the OCT4-expressing PCA cells selected using the EOS system.

Estrogen's side effects on breast and uterine tissues leading to the potential increased risk of uterine and breast cancer limit widespread estrogen usage. Thus, there is a significant medical need for a therapy that protects against postmenopausal bone loss but is free of estrogen's negative effects on reproductive tissues. Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) have been investigated as an alternative to hormone replacement therapy. One such compound, raloxifene, has been approved for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. Lasofoxifene (LAS), a new, nonsteroidal, and potent SERM, is an estrogen antagonist or agonist depending on the target tissue. LAS selectively binds with high affinity to human estrogen receptors. In ovariectomized (OVX) rat studies, LAS prevented the decrease in femoral bone mineral density, tibial and lumbar vertebral trabecular bone mass at an ED100 of about 60 μg/kg/day. LAS inhibited the activation of trabecular and endocortical bone resorption and bone turnover in tibial metaphyses and diaphyses, and lumbar vertebral body in OVX rats. In addition, LAS decreased total serum cholesterol, inhibited body weight gain and increased soleus muscle weight in OVX rats. Similarly, LAS prevented bone loss induced by orchidectomy or aging in male rats by decreasing bone resorption and bone turnover while it had no effect in the prostate. Further, LAS decreased total serum cholesterol in intact aged male rats or in orchidectomized male rats. Synergestic skeletal effects were found with LAS in combination with bone anabolic agents such as prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), parathyroid hormone (PTH) or a growth hormone secretagoue (GHS) in OVX rats. In combination with estrogen, LAS inhibited the uterine stimulating effects of estrogen but did not block the bone protective effects of estrogen. In immature and aged female rats, LAS did not affect the uterine weight and uterine histology. In OVX adult female rats, LAS slightly but significantly increased uterine weight. These results demonstrated that LAS produced effects on the skeleton indistinguishable from estrogen in female and male rats. However, unlike estrogen, LAS had little effect on uterine weight and cellular proliferation of uterus in female rats. In preclinical anti-tumor studies, LAS inhibited human breast cancer growth in mice bearing MCF7 tumors, prevented NMU-induced mammary carcinomas and possessed chemotherapeutic effects in NMU-induced carcinomas in rats. Therefore, we conclude that LAS possesses the antiestrogenic effects in breast tissue and estrogenic effects in bone and serum cholesterol, but lacks estrogen's side effects on uterine tissue. These data support the therapeutic potential of LAS for the prevention and treatment of postmenopausal bone loss and mammary carcinomas in humans.""","""['H Z Ke', 'T A Brown', 'D D Thompson']""","""[]""","""2002""","""None""","""J Am Aging Assoc""","""['Lasofoxifene, a next generation estrogen receptor modulator: preclinical studies.', 'Lasofoxifene (CP-336,156) protects against the age-related changes in bone mass, bone strength, and total serum cholesterol in intact aged male rats.', 'Lasofoxifene (CP-336,156), a selective estrogen receptor modulator, prevents bone loss induced by aging and orchidectomy in the adult rat.', 'Effects of droloxifene on prevention of cancellous bone loss and bone turnover in the axial skeleton of aged, ovariectomized rats.', 'Next generation selective estrogen receptor modulators.', 'Therapeutic Treatments for Osteoporosis-Which Combination of Pills Is the Best among the Bad?', 'SERMs have substance-specific effects on bone, and these effects are mediated via ERαAF-1 in female mice.', 'Molecular analysis of the vaginal response to estrogens in the ovariectomized rat and postmenopausal woman.']"""

TRAMP mice were crossed to the eight progenitor strains of the Collaborative Cross recombinant inbred panel to address this. Tumor growth and metastasis burden were quantified in heterozygous transgene positive F1 male mice at 30 weeks of age.

Conversely, TRAMP x WSB/EiJ and TRAMP x PWK/PhJ F1 males displayed significant reductions in tumor growth. Interestingly, despite reduced tumor burden, TRAMP x WSB/EiJ males had an increased nodal metastasis burden. Patterns of distant pulmonary metastasis tended to follow the same patterns as that of local dissemination in each of the strains. All tumors and metastases displayed positive staining for NE markers, synaptophysin, and FOXA2.

While epidermal growth factor (EGF) is widely used in maintaining PCSC cells in vitro, the importance of EGF-dependent signaling and its downstream pathways in PCSC self-renewal are not well characterized. By investigating DU145 sphere cells, a population of prostate cancer cells with stem-like properties, we report here that epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling plays a critical role in the propagation of DU145 PCSCs. Activation of EGFR signaling via addition of EGF and ectopic expression of a constitutively-active EGFR mutant (EGFRvIII) increased sphere formation. Conversely, inhibition of EGFR signaling by using EGFR inhibitors (AG1478 and PD168393) and knockdown of EGFR significantly inhibited PCSC self-renewal. Consistent with the MEK-ERK pathway being a major target of EGFR signaling, activation of the MEK-ERK pathway contributed to EGFR-facilitated PCSC propagation. Modulation of EGFR signaling affected extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) activation. Inhibition of ERK activation through multiple approaches, including treatment with the MEK inhibitor U0126, ectopic expression of dominant-negative MEK1(K97M), and knockdown of either ERK1 or ERK2 resulted in a robust reduction in PCSC propagation.

Our aim in this present study was the specific quantitative expression analysis of the classical KLK15 mRNA transcript in prostate tumors and the examination of its clinical significance in prostate cancer.  Methods:   We isolated total RNA from 150 prostate tissue specimens and, following cDNA synthesis, the expression of KLK15 classical mRNA transcript was measured via quantitative Real-Time PCR using the TaqMan® chemistry. HPRT1 was used as a reference gene, and the absolute quantification approach, through the incorporation of standard curves, was applied for the calculation of normalized KLK15 expression.  Results:   KLK15 expression levels were significantly upregulated in malignant compared to benign samples (P < 0.001).

In the current study, the authors used these assessments to determine comorbidity and prognosis before prostate biopsy and the subsequent diagnosis of prostate cancer to identify those patients least likely to benefit from treatment.  Methods:   A prospective observational cohort study was performed of 104 participants aged 64.0 years ± 6.5 years from 3 institutions representing different health care delivery systems.

Associations between the comorbidity scores and nonelective hospital admissions were investigated using logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards models.  Results:   Among the 104 patients who underwent prostate biopsy, 2 died during the follow-up period. The overall hospital admission rate was 20% (21 of 104 patients). Higher scores on both the TIBI-CaP (≥ 9) and CCI (≥ 3) were found to be significantly associated with an increased odds for hospital admission (odds ratio, 11.3 [95% confidence interval (95% CI), 2.4-53.6] and OR, 5.7 [95% CI, 1.4-22.4]) and hazards ratios (HRs) for time to hospital admission (HR, 3.8 [95% CI, 1.3-11.2] and HR, 3.2 [95% CI, 1.1-9.1]), respectively.  Conclusions:   TIBI-CaP and CCI scores were found to successfully predict which patients were at high risk for nonelective hospital admission.

Patients harboring this genetic event are currently eligible for treatment with antifibroblast growth factor receptor small-molecule inhibitors in phase I clinical trials. This has the potential to significantly improve standard therapy for lung squamous cell carcinoma patients. The aim of this study was to elucidate whether fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 amplification is also a common genetic event in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. For this purpose, we assembled a cohort of 555 patients, including 264 with metastatic disease and 147 with recurrent disease. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded material of primary tumors, metastases and recurrences were assessed for fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 copy number status using fluorescence in situ hybridization. Human papilloma virus status was detected by p16 immunohistochemistry staining and PCR-ELISA. Molecular parameters were correlated with each other and with clinicopathological data. We found 15% of primary head and neck squamous cell carcinoma to display a fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 amplification. In nearly all cases, metastatic and recurrent tumor samples shared the same amplification status as the corresponding primary tumor. Fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 amplification was associated with nicotine and alcohol consumption, but was mutually exclusive with human papilloma virus infection. Amplification of the gene was associated with parameters of worse outcome. Our data identify fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 amplification as a frequent event in primary and metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and represents a potential biomarker for more aggressive disease. Fibroblast growth factor receptor 1-amplified tumors could potentially comprise a subset of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma against which targeted small-molecule inhibitors hold therapeutic efficacy.""","""['Friederike Göke', 'Maike Bode', 'Alina Franzen', 'Robert Kirsten', 'Diane Goltz', 'Antonia Göke', 'Rakesh Sharma', 'Diana Boehm', 'Wenzel Vogel', 'Patrick Wagner', 'Claudia Lengerke', 'Glen Kristiansen', 'Jutta Kirfel', 'Tobias Van Bremen', 'Friedrich Bootz', 'Lynn E Heasley', 'Andreas Schröck', 'Sven Perner']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Mod Pathol""","""['Prevalence of fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) amplification in squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck.', 'Fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 as a potential therapeutic target in sinonasal cancer.', 'Expression and role of the embryonic protein SOX2 in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.', 'Prognostic implications of FGFR1 and MYC status in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.', 'Molecular targeted therapies in the management of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma: recent developments and perspectives.', 'Diagnostic, Prognostic, and Therapeutic Role for Angiogenesis Markers in Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma: A Narrative Review.', 'Therapeutic Targeting of FGFR Signaling in Head and Neck Cancer.', 'Novel Systemic Treatment Modalities Including Immunotherapy and Molecular Targeted Therapy for Recurrent and Metastatic Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma.', 'Investigation of an FGFR-Signaling-Related Prognostic Model and Immune Landscape in Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma.', 'Prognostic value of FGFR1 expression and amplification in patients with HNSCC: A systematic review and meta-analysis.']"""

Methods:   We prospectively recruited data for consecutive patients treated by RARLP for PCa with an initial PSA level below 10 ng/mL between 2003 and 2011 at our institution. We divided the population into two groups: patients with a PSA level below 4 ng/mL (G1; n = 53) and patients with a PSA level between 4 and 10 ng/mL (G2; n = 371). Biochemical recurrence was defined as a single increase in PSA greater than 0.2 ng/mL after surgery. Multivariate analysis was used to assess prognostic factors of recurrence-free survival.  Results:   Overall, 424 patients were included, and the median age was 62 (58-67) years. The median PSA was 5.8 ng/mL (4.8-7.7 ng/mL). Overall, 6 patients from G1 and 34 patients from G2 experienced a biochemical recurrence. Overall, the 5-year recurrence-free survival rate was 86.6 %. The PSA level at diagnosis (under or over 4 ng/mL) was not significantly linked to recurrence-free survival (HR = 0.59, p = 0.25). However, positive margins and a Gleason score >7 on the specimen were significantly linked to recurrence-free survival with respective hazard ratios of 4.30 (p < 0.0001) and 6.18 (p < 0.0001), respectively.

An understanding of the natural history of node-positive prostate cancer (PCa) and identifying prognostic factors is needed.  Objective:   To assess outcomes for patients with LNM treated with RP and lymph node dissection (LND) alone.  Design, setting, and participants:   We analyzed data from a consecutive cohort of 369 men with LNM treated at a single institution from 1988 to 2010.  Intervention:   RP and extended LND.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Our primary aim was to model overall survival, PCa-specific survival, metastasis-free progression, and freedom from biochemical recurrence (BCR). We used univariate Cox proportional hazard regression models for survival outcomes. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression models were used for freedom from metastasis and freedom from BCR, with prostate-specific antigen, Gleason score, extraprostatic extension, seminal vesical invasion, surgical margin status, and number of positive nodes as predictors.  Results and limitations:   Sixty-four patients with LNM died, 37 from disease. Seventy patients developed metastasis, and 201 experienced BCR. The predicted 10-yr overall survival and cancer-specific survival were 60% (95% confidence interval [CI], 49-69) and 72% (95% CI, 61-80), respectively. The 10-yr probability of freedom from distant metastasis and freedom from BCR were 65% (95% CI, 56-73) and 28% (95% CI, 21-36), respectively. Higher pathologic Gleason score (>7 compared with ≤ 7; hazard ratio [HR]: 2.23; 95% CI, 1.64-3.04; p < 0.0001) and three or more positive lymph nodes (HR: 2.61; 95% CI, 1.81-3.76; p < 0.0001) were significantly associated with increased risk of BCR on multivariable analysis. The retrospective nature and single-center source of data are study limitations.  Conclusions:   A considerable subset of men with LNM remained free of disease 10 yr after RP and extended LND alone. Patients with pathologic Gleason score <8 and low nodal metastatic burden represent a favorable group.

Circulating MIF levels are elevated in several types of human cancer including prostate cancer. MIF is released presumably by both stromal and tumor cells and enhances malignant growth and metastasis by diverse mechanisms, such as stimulating tumor cell proliferation, suppressing apoptotic death, facilitating invasion of the extracellular matrix, and promoting angiogenesis. Recently described fully human anti-MIF antibodies were tested in vitro and in vivo for their ability to influence growth rate and invasion of the human PC3 prostate cancer cell line. In vitro, the selected candidate antibodies BaxG03, BaxB01, and BaxM159 reduced cell growth and viability by inhibiting MIF-induced phosphorylation of the central kinases p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase [extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1 and -2 (ERK1/2)] and protein kinase B (AKT). Incubation of cells in the presence of the antibodies also promoted activation of caspase-3/7. The antibodies furthermore inhibited MIF-promoted invasion and chemotaxis as transmigration through Matrigel along a MIF gradient was impaired. In vivo, pharmacokinetic parameters (half-life, volume of distribution, and bioavailability) of the antibodies were determined and a proof-of-concept was obtained in a PC3-xenograft mouse model. Treatment with human anti-MIF antibodies blunted xenograft tumor growth in a dose-dependent manner. We therefore conclude that the anti-MIF antibodies described neutralize some of the key tumor-promoting activities of MIF and thus limit tumor growth in vivo.""","""['Filza Hussain', 'Michael Freissmuth', 'Dirk Völkel', 'Michael Thiele', 'Patrice Douillard', 'Gerhard Antoine', 'Patrick Thurner', 'Hartmut Ehrlich', 'Hans-Peter Schwarz', 'Friedrich Scheiflinger', 'Randolf J Kerschbaumer']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Ther""","""['OxMIF: a druggable isoform of macrophage migration inhibitory factor in cancer and inflammatory diseases.', 'Macrophage migration inhibitory factor promotes osteosarcoma growth and lung metastasis through activating the RAS/MAPK pathway.', 'Inhibition of macrophage migration inhibitory factor or its receptor (CD74) attenuates growth and invasion of DU-145 prostate cancer cells.', 'Sea cucumber extract TBL-12 inhibits the proliferation, migration, and invasion of human prostate cancer cells through the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and intrinsic caspase apoptosis pathway.', 'Targeting the heat shock protein 90: a rational way to inhibit macrophage migration inhibitory factor function in cancer.', 'Preclinical Evaluation of ON203, A Novel Bioengineered mAb Targeting Oxidized Macrophage Migration Inhibitory Factor as an Anticancer Therapeutic.', 'CXCR7 as a novel therapeutic target for advanced prostate cancer.', 'OxMIF: a druggable isoform of macrophage migration inhibitory factor in cancer and inflammatory diseases.', 'Association between trichomoniasis and prostate and bladder diseases: a population-based case-control study.', 'TA-MSCs, TA-MSCs-EVs, MIF: their crosstalk in immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment.']"""

An accurate MC model of the Siemens OptiVue1000 EPID was first developed using the penelope code, integrating a non-uniform backscatter modelling. Two already existing denoising algorithms were then applied on simulated portal images, namely the iterative reduction of noise (IRON) method and the locally adaptive Savitzky-Golay (LASG) method. A third denoising method, based on a nonparametric Bayesian framework and called DPGLM (for Dirichlet process generalized linear model) was also developed. Performances of the IRON, LASG and DPGLM methods, in terms of smoothing capabilities and computation time, were compared for portal images computed for different values of the RMS pixel noise (up to 10%) in three different configurations, a heterogeneous phantom irradiated by a non-conformal 15 × 15 cm(2) field, a conformal beam from a pelvis treatment plan, and an IMRT beam from a prostate treatment plan. For all configurations, DPGLM outperforms both IRON and LASG by providing better smoothing performances and demonstrating a better robustness with respect to noise. Additionally, no parameter tuning is required by DPGLM, which makes the denoising step very generic and easy to handle for any portal image. Concerning the computation time, the denoising of 1024 × 1024 images takes about 1 h 30 min, 2 h and 5 min using DPGLM, IRON, and LASG, respectively. This paper shows the feasibility to predict within a few hours and with the same resolution as real images accurate portal images, combining MC simulations with the DPGLM denoising algorithm.""","""['D Lazaro', 'E Barat', 'C Le Loirec', 'T Dautremer', 'T Montagu', 'L Guérin', 'A Batalla']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['A comparison of Monte Carlo dose calculation denoising techniques.', 'Electron beam treatment verification using measured and Monte Carlo predicted portal images.', 'An investigation of the accuracy of Monte Carlo portal dosimetry for verification of IMRT with extended fields.', 'A literature review of electronic portal imaging for radiotherapy dosimetry.', 'From heuristic optimization to dictionary learning: a review and comprehensive comparison of image denoising algorithms.']"""

This study evaluated the safety and efficacy of an implantable and biodegradable balloon specifically designed to protect rectal tissue during radiotherapy by increasing the prostate-rectum interspace.  Patients and methods:   Balloons were transperineally implanted, under transrectal ultrasound guidance, into the prostate-rectum interspace in 27 patients with localized prostate cancer scheduled to undergo radiotherapy. Patients underwent two simulations for radiotherapy planning--the first simulation before implant, and the second simulation seven days post implant. The balloon position, the dimensions of the prostate, and the distance between the prostate and rectum were evaluated by CT/US examinations 1 week after the implant, weekly during the radiotherapy period, and at 3 and 6 months post implant. Dose-volume histograms of pre and post implantation were compared. Adverse events were recorded throughout the study period.  Results:   Four of 27 patients were excluded from the evaluation. One was excluded due to a technical failure during implant, and three patients were excluded because the balloon prematurely deflated. The balloon status was evaluated for the duration of the radiotherapy period in 23 patients. With the balloon implant, the distance between the prostate and rectum increased 10-fold, from a mean 0.22 ± 0.2 cm to 2.47 ± 0.47 cm. During the radiotherapy period the balloon length changed from 4.25 ± 0.49 cm to 3.81 ± 0.84 cm and the balloon height from 1.86 ± 0.24 cm to 1.67 ± 0.22 cm. But the prostate-rectum interspace distance remained constant from beginning to end of radiotherapy: 2.47 ± 0.47 cm and 2.41 ± 0.43 cm, respectively. A significant mean reduction in calculated rectal radiation exposure was achieved. The implant procedure was well tolerated. The adverse events included mild pain at the perineal skin and in the anus. Three patients experienced acute urinary retention which resolved in a few hours following conservative treatment. No infections or thromboembolic events occurred during the implant procedure or during the radiotherapy period.  Conclusion:   The transperineal implantation of the biodegradable balloon in patients scheduled to receive radiotherapy was safe and achieved a significant and constant gap between the prostate and rectum. This separation resulted in an important reduction in the rectal radiation dose. A prospective study to evaluate the acute and late rectal toxicity is needed.""","""['Eliahu Gez', 'Shmuel Cytron', 'Rahamin Ben Yosef', 'Daniel London', 'Benjamin W Corn', 'Shlomi Alani', 'Giovanni Scarzello', 'Fabrizio Dal Moro', 'Guido Sotti', 'Filiberto Zattoni', 'Ike Koziol', 'Taryn Torre', 'Matthew Bassignani', 'Shalom Kalnicki', 'Reza Ghavamian', 'Dukagjin Blakaj', 'Mitchell Anscher', 'Martin Sommerauer', 'Dieter Jocham', 'Corinna Melchert', 'Stefan Huttenlocher', 'Gyoergy Kovacs', 'Madhur Garg']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Radiat Oncol""","""['Interstitial biodegradable balloon for reduced rectal dose during prostate radiotherapy: results of a virtual planning investigation based on the pre- and post-implant imaging data of an international multicenter study.', 'Implantation of a biodegradable rectum balloon implant: tips, Tricks and Pitfalls.', 'Organ movements and dose exposures in teletherapy of prostate cancer using a rectal balloon.', 'Prostate-rectum spacers: optimization of prostate cancer irradiation.', 'Absorbable Hydrogel Spacer Use in Prostate Radiotherapy: A Comprehensive Review of Phase 3 Clinical Trial Published Data.', 'Application of Hydrogel Spacer SpaceOAR Vue for Prostate Radiotherapy.', 'Dose-escalated radiotherapy to 82\xa0Gy for prostate cancer following insertion of a peri-rectal hydrogel spacer: 3-year outcomes from a phase II trial.', 'Rectal Radiation Dose and Clinical Outcomes in Prostate Cancer Patients Treated With Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy With and Without Hydrogel.', 'Rectal Perforation by a Balloon Spacer: A Rare Cause of Rectal Perforation Addressed Endoscopically.', 'Use of a Biodegradable, Contrast-Filled Rectal Spacer Balloon in Intensity-Modulated Radiotherapy for Intermediate-Risk Prostate Cancer Patients: Dosimetric Gains in the BioPro-RCMI-1505 Study.']"""

Patient acceptance and results""","""Objectives:   To evaluate the acceptance of active monitoring by patients treated in our healthcare community and to report the clinical results of an active surveillance program in patients with low-risk prostate cancer.  Material and methods:   Prospective study of patients enrolled in an active surveillance programme at our centre between 2004 and 2012. The inclusion criteria were PSA <10 ng/ml, Gleason score ≤6, clinical stage T1c/T2a, ≤2 positive cores, and no more than 50% of the core being affected. Curative treatment was proposed when faced with pathological progression over the course of the monitoring.  Results:   In 2011, only 17% of the total number of potential candidate patients rejected their inclusion in a surveillance programme and were treated actively. We analysed a series of 144 patients included in our active surveillance protocol. The mean follow-up time was 3.22 years (SD 2.08). A total of 110 patients (76.3%) remained under active monitoring, with an estimated median treatment-free survival after diagnosis of 6.9 years (95% CI: 6.2-7.6). The percentage of patients who remained free of treatment at 2 and 5 years was 96.3% (95% CI: 92.8%-99.8%) and 70.9% (95% CI: 59.3%-85.5%), respectively. Thirty four patients (23.6%) required curative treatment. The mean time to treatment was 4.6 years (SD 2.3).

The aim of the present study is to explore the potential of VEGF (also known as VEGF-A) as a prognostic and predictive biomarker among men with locally advanced prostate cancer.  Methods:   The analysis was performed using patients enrolled on RTOG 8610, a phase III randomized control trial of radiation therapy alone (Arm 1) versus short-term neoadjuvant and concurrent androgen deprivation and radiation therapy (Arm 2) in men with locally advanced prostate carcinoma. Tissue samples were obtained from the RTOG tissue repository. Hematoxylin and eosin slides were reviewed, and paraffin blocks were immunohistochemically stained for VEGF expression and graded by Intensity score (0-3). Cox or Fine and Gray's proportional hazards models were used.  Results:   Sufficient pathologic material was available from 103 (23%) of the 456 analyzable patients enrolled in the RTOG 8610 study. There were no statistically significant differences in the pre-treatment characteristics between the patient groups with and without VEGF intensity data. Median follow-up for all surviving patients with VEGF intensity data is 12.2 years. Univariate and multivariate analyses demonstrated no statistically significant correlation between the intensity of VEGF expression and overall survival, distant metastasis, local progression, disease-free survival, or biochemical failure. VEGF expression was also not statistically significantly associated with any of the endpoints when analyzed by treatment arm.  Conclusions:   This study revealed no statistically significant prognostic or predictive value of VEGF expression for locally advanced prostate cancer.

Methods. The PC3 human prostate adenocarcinoma cell line was irradiated using a 6 MV x-ray beam to assess clonogenic cell deaths with the specific aim to investigate cell survival in a dose cold spot. Radiation-induced cell survival in a 20% lower dose region, compared to that of cells receiving 100% of the prescribed dose (2 Gy), was assessed for experimental set-ups when under-irradiated cells were either in direct contact with cells receiving 2 Gy or irradiated separately. In addition, the results were compared against non-irradiated controls. Results. A significant (p < 0.001) decrease in cell survival was found when cells, collocated in the same flask, received either 100% or 80% of the prescribed dose (the dose distribution contained a cold spot of 20% lower dose) compared to non-irradiated cells. However, in the experiment in which the entire flask was exposed to only 80% of the prescribed dose, the mean difference in cell survival compared to non-irradiated control was not significant (p > 0.05). This was contrary to a significant decrease (p < 0.001) in survival of cells receiving 100% of the prescribed dose versus the control. Additionally, significant reduction (p < 0.05) in cell survival was observed for cells which were under-irradiated by 20% but collocated in the same flask with cells receiving 100% dose compared to cells where the entire flask was irradiated with 80% of the prescribed dose. Conclusion. For the given cell line, under existing growing and treatment conditions, the cell survival in the dose cold spot region was significantly lower when under-irradiated cells were in contact with the cells receiving 100% of the prescribed dose compared to survival of cells under-irradiated by the same amount of radiation but treated separately to cells receiving 100% dose.""","""['Svetlana Sjostedt', 'Eva Bezak', 'Loredana Marcu']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Acta Oncol""","""['Experimental investigation of the cytotoxicity of medium-borne signals in human prostate cancer cell line.', 'Cellular response to modulated radiation fields.', 'Medium-mediated intercellular communication is involved in bystander responses of X-ray-irradiated normal human fibroblasts.', 'Radiosensitivity of Prostate Cancer Cell Lines for Irradiation from Beta Particle-emitting Radionuclide ¹⁷⁷Lu Compared to Alpha Particles and Gamma Rays.', 'Ionizing radiation-induced bystander effects, potential targets for modulation of radiotherapy.', 'High dose bystander effects in spatially fractionated radiation therapy.']"""

The objective is to achieve both high-efficiency and high-precision dose delivering by considering characteristics of leaf sequencing process. The key factor which affects total number of monitor units for the leaf sequencing optimization process is the max flow value of the digraph which formulated from the fluence maps. Therefore, we believe that one strategy for compromising dose conformity and total number of monitor units in dose delivery is to balance the dose distribution function and the max flow value mentioned above. However, there are too many paths in the digraph, and we don't know the flow value of which path is the maximum. The maximum flow value among the horizontal paths was selected and used in the objective function of the fluence map optimization to formulate the model. The model is a traditional linear constrained quadratic optimization model which can be solved by interior point method easily. We believe that the smoothed maps from this model are more suitable for leaf sequencing optimization process than other smoothing models. A clinical head-neck case and a prostate case were tested and compared using our proposed model and the smoothing model which is based on the minimization of total variance. The optimization results with the same level of total number of monitor units (TNMU) show that the fluence maps obtained from our model have much better dose performance for the target/non-target region than the maps from total variance based on the smoothing model. This indicates that our model achieves better dose distribution when the algorithm suppresses the TNMU at the same level. Although we have just used the max flow value of the horizontal paths in the diagraph in the objective function, a good balance has been achieved between the dose conformity and the total number of monitor units. This idea can be extended to other fluence map optimization model, and we believe it can also achieve good performance.""","""['Yihua Lan', 'Haozheng Ren', 'Cunhua Li', 'Zhifang Min', 'Jinxin Wan', 'Jianxin Ma', 'Chih-Cheng Hung']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Technol Cancer Res Treat""","""['A novel fluence map optimization model incorporating leaf sequencing constraints.', 'Using total-variation regularization for intensity modulated radiation therapy inverse planning with field-specific numbers of segments.', 'Simultaneous beam geometry and intensity map optimization in intensity-modulated radiation therapy.', 'Efficient IMRT inverse planning with a new L1-solver: template for first-order conic solver.', 'Intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) for the patient.']"""

It now shows promise as an anticancer drug and radiosensitizer. Proposed mechanisms of action include the induction of oxidative stress and inhibition of proteasome activity. Our purpose was to determine the potential of disulfiram to enhance the antitumor efficacy of external-beam γ-irradiation and (131)I-metaiodobenzylguanidine ((131)I-MIBG), a radiopharmaceutical used for the therapy of neuroendocrine tumors.  Methods:   The role of copper in disulfiram-induced toxicity was investigated by clonogenic assay after treatment of human SK-N-BE(2c) neuroblastoma and UVW/noradrenaline transporter (NAT) glioma cells. The synergistic interaction between disulfiram and radiotherapy was evaluated by combination-index analysis. Tumor growth delay was determined in vitro using multicellular tumor spheroids and in vivo using human tumor xenografts in athymic mice.  Results:   Escalating the disulfiram dosage caused a biphasic reduction in the surviving fraction of clonogens. Clonogenic cell kill after treatment with disulfiram concentrations less than 4 μM was copper-dependent, whereas cytotoxicity at concentrations greater than 10 μM was caused by oxidative stress. The cytotoxic effect of disulfiram was maximal when administered with equimolar copper. Likewise, disulfiram radiosensitization of tumor cells was copper-dependent. Furthermore, disulfiram treatment enhanced the toxicity of (131)I-MIBG to spheroids and xenografts expressing the noradrenaline transporter.  Conclusion:   The results demonstrate that the cytotoxicity of disulfiram was copper-dependent, the molar excess of disulfiram relative to copper resulted in attenuation of disulfiram-mediated cytotoxicity, copper was required for the radiosensitizing activity of disulfiram, and copper-complexed disulfiram enhanced the efficacy not only of external-beam radiation but also of targeted radionuclide therapy in the form of (131)I-MIBG. Therefore, disulfiram may have anticancer potential in combination with radiotherapy.""","""['Colin Rae', 'Mathias Tesson', 'John W Babich', 'Marie Boyd', 'Annette Sorensen', 'Robert J Mairs']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""['Inhibition of poly(ADP-Ribose) polymerase enhances the toxicity of 131I-metaiodobenzylguanidine/topotecan combination therapy to cells and xenografts that express the noradrenaline transporter.', 'Radiosensitization of noradrenaline transporter-expressing tumour cells by proteasome inhibitors and the role of reactive oxygen species.', '131Imeta-iodobenzylguanidine and topotecan combination treatment of tumors expressing the noradrenaline transporter.', 'Radiation quality-dependent bystander effects elicited by targeted radionuclides.', 'The combination of disulfiram and copper for cancer treatment.', 'Aldehyde dehydrogenase in solid tumors and other diseases: Potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets.', 'The Role of Copper Homeostasis in Brain Disease.', 'Improving the Therapeutic Efficacy of Sorafenib for Hepatocellular Carcinoma by Repurposing Disulfiram.', 'DSF/Cu induces antitumor effect against diffuse large B-cell lymphoma through suppressing NF-κB/BCL6 pathways.', 'Cytotoxic effect of disulfiram/copper on human cervical cancer cell lines and LGR5-positive cancer stem-like cells.']"""

Methods:   We analyzed an observational cohort from the population-based Prostate Cancer Outcomes Study, which included men aged 55 to 74 years diagnosed with localized PC between October 1994 and October 1995 who underwent either RP (n = 1164) or EBRT (n = 491) within 1 year of diagnosis. Patients were followed until death or study end (December 31, 2010). Overall and disease-specific mortality were assessed with multivariable survival analysis, with propensity scores to adjust for potential treatment selection confounders (demographics, comorbidities, and tumor characteristics). All statistical tests were two-sided.  Results:   After 15 years of follow-up, there were 568 deaths, including 104 from PC. RP was associated with statistically significant advantages for overall (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.60, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.53 to 0.70, P <.0001.) and disease-specific mortality (HR = 0.35, 95% CI = 0.26 to 0.49, P <.0001.). Mortality benefits for RP were also observed within treatment propensity quintiles, when subjects were pair-matched on propensity scores, and in subgroup analyses based on age, tumor characteristics, and comorbidity.  Conclusions:   Population-based observational data on men diagnosed with localized PC in the mid-1990s suggest a mortality benefit associated with RP vs EBRT. Possible explanations include residual selection bias or a true survival advantage. Results might be less applicable for men facing treatment decisions today.""","""['Richard M Hoffman', 'Tatsuki Koyama', 'Kang-Hsien Fan', 'Peter C Albertsen', 'Michael J Barry', 'Michael Goodman', 'Ann S Hamilton', 'Arnold L Potosky', 'Janet L Stanford', 'Antoinette M Stroup', 'David F Penson']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Natl Cancer Inst""","""['Is it time to reevaluate definitive therapy in prostate cancer?', 'Prostate cancer: to EBRT or not to EBRT: surgery or radiotherapy for localized prostate cancer?

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) are important in cancer progression and regulation of EMT. To explore the biological significance and regulatory mechanism of EMT, we determined the expression, the biological function and the signaling pathway of prostate transmembrane protein, androgen induced-1 (TMEPAI), during the induction of EMT and cell migration. Transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 significantly upregulated the expression of TMEPAI during EMT in human lung adenocarcinoma. Depletion of TMEPAI abolished TGF-β1-induced downregulation of ferritin heavy chain and the subsequent generation of ROS, thus suppressing TGF-β1-induced EMT and cell migration. In addition, increased ROS production and overexpression of TMEPAI downregulated the level of IRS-1. Both the addition of H2O2 and IRS-1 small interfering RNA rescued the ability of TGF-β1 to induce EMT in TMEPAI-depleted cells. Remarkably, the levels of TMEPAI in lung tumor tissues are very high, whereas its expression in normal lung epithelium is very low. Moreover, TMEPAI expression was positively correlated with the cell mesenchymal phenotype and migration potential. Our work reveals that TMEPAI contributes to TGF-β1-induced EMT through ROS production and IRS-1 downregulation in lung cancer cells.""","""['Ying Hu', 'Kai He', 'Dongmei Wang', 'Xinwang Yuan', 'Yi Liu', 'Hongbin Ji', 'Jianguo Song']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Carcinogenesis""","""['Insulin receptor substrate-1 suppresses transforming growth factor-beta1-mediated epithelial-mesenchymal transition.', 'Ferritin heavy chain-mediated iron homeostasis and subsequent increased reactive oxygen species production are essential for epithelial-mesenchymal transition.', 'GP73 promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition and invasion partly by activating TGF-β1/Smad2 signaling in hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'ROS-Nrf2 pathway mediates the development of TGF-β1-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition through the activation of Notch signaling.', 'Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in pancreatic adenocarcinoma.', 'Identification of a TGF-β signaling-related gene signature for prediction of immunotherapy and targeted therapy for lung adenocarcinoma.', 'Sex Hormones and Lung Inflammation.', 'Analysis of Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition Metabolism Identifies Possible Cancer Biomarkers Useful in Diverse Genetic Backgrounds.', 'PMEPA1 Gene Isoforms: A Potential Biomarker and Therapeutic Target in Prostate Cancer.', 'Smart Sorting of Tumor Phenotype with Versatile Fluorescent Ag Nanoclusters by Sensing Specific Reactive Oxygen Species.']"""

Materials and methods:   From consecutive MR-guided prostate biopsies (2008-2012) in our referral center, we retrospectively included patients from whom diffusion-weighted MR imaging ADC values were acquired during MR-guided biopsy and whose biopsy cores had a (cancer) core length 10 mm or greater and originated from the transition zone. Two radiologists, who were blinded to the ADC data, annotated regions of interest on biopsy sampling locations of MR-guided biopsy confirmation scans in consensus. Median ADC (mADC) of the regions of interest was related to histopathology outcome in MR-guided biopsy core specimens. Mixed model analysis was used to evaluate mADC differences between 7 histopathology categories predefined as MR-guided biopsy core specimens with primary and secondary GG 4-5 (I), primary GG 4-5 secondary GG 2-3 (II), primary GG 2-3 secondary GG 4-5 (III) and primary and secondary GG 2-3 cancer (IV), and noncancerous tissue without (V) or with degree 1 (VI) or degree 2 prostatitis (VII). Diagnostic accuracy was evaluated using areas under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC) curve.  Results:   Fifty-two patients with 87 cancer-containing biopsy cores and 53 patients with 101 non-cancerous biopsy cores were included. Significant mean mADC differences were present between cancers (mean mADC, 0.77-0.86 × 10 mm/s) and noncancerous transition zone without (1.12 × 10 mm/s) and with degree 1 to 2 prostatitis (1.05-1.12 × 10 mm/s; P < 0.0001-0.05). Exceptions were mixed primary and secondary GG cancers versus a degree 2 of prostatitis (P = 0.06-0.09). No significant differences were found between subcategories of primary and secondary GG cancers (P = 0.17-0.91) and between a degree 1 and 2 prostatitis and non-cancerous transition zone without prostatitis (P = 0.48-0.94).The mADC had an AUC of 0.84 to differentiate cancer versus non-cancerous transition zone. AUCs of 0.84 and 0.56 were found for mADC to differentiate prostatitis from cancer and from non-cancerous transition zone. The mADC had an AUC of 0.62 to differentiate a primary GG 4 versus GG 3 cancer.  Conclusions:   The mADC values can differentiate transition zone cancer from non-cancerous transition zone and from a degree 1, and from most cases of a degree 2 prostatitis. However, because of substantial overlap, mADC has a moderate accuracy to differentiate between different primary and secondary GG subcategories and cannot be used to differentiate non-cancerous transition zone from degrees 1 to 2 of prostatitis. Diffusion-weighted imaging ADC may therefore contribute in the detection of transition zone cancers; however, as a single functional MR imaging technique, diffusion-weighted imaging has a moderate diagnostic accuracy in separating higher from lower GG transition zone cancers and in differentiating prostatitis from non-cancerous transition zone.""","""['Caroline M A Hoeks', 'Eline K Vos', 'Joyce G R Bomers', 'Jelle O Barentsz', 'Christina A Hulsbergen-van de Kaa', 'Tom W Scheenen']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Invest Radiol""","""['Differentiation of prostatitis and prostate cancer by using diffusion-weighted MR imaging and MR-guided biopsy at 3 T.', 'Evaluation of diffusion-weighted MR imaging at inclusion in an active surveillance protocol for low-risk prostate cancer.', 'Quantitative Analysis of Diffusion Weighted Imaging May Improve Risk Stratification of Prostatic Transition Zone Lesions.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'The diagnostic accuracy and cost-effectiveness of magnetic resonance spectroscopy and enhanced magnetic resonance imaging techniques in aiding the localisation of prostate abnormalities for biopsy: a systematic review and economic evaluation.', 'Diagnosis of transition zone prostate cancer by multiparametric MRI: added value of MR spectroscopic imaging with sLASER volume selection.', 'Voxel-level Classification of Prostate Cancer on Magnetic Resonance Imaging: Improving Accuracy Using Four-Compartment Restriction Spectrum Imaging.', 'Improved Characterization of Diffusion in Normal and Cancerous Prostate Tissue Through Optimization of Multicompartmental Signal Models.', 'Comparative Study of Monoexponential, Intravoxel Incoherent Motion, Kurtosis, and IVIM-Kurtosis Models for the Diagnosis and Aggressiveness Assessment of Prostate Cancer.', 'MR Fingerprinting and ADC Mapping for Characterization of Lesions in the Transition Zone of the Prostate Gland.']"""

Methods:   Retrospective, single-center analysis of consecutive patients (n = 897) who underwent prostate biopsy (S1) with all 12 cores from far lateral areas (n = 269) or prostate biopsy (S2) with 6 cores from parasagittal and 6 from far lateral areas (n = 628).  Results:   Crude cancer detection rates with S1 and S2 were similar (39.0 and 38.9% for the first biopsy and 29.4 and 31.3% for repeated biopsies, respectively). Abnormal digital rectal exam, lower prostate volume and higher prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels were independently associated with higher odds of cancer detection. Regarding first biopsies (n = 747), there was significant interaction between biopsy scheme and PSA (p < 0.001). Overall, the adjusted odds of cancer detection were higher with S1 (S1/S2 odds ratio = 2.54, 95% CI: 1.12-5.74), but the S1-S2 relationship was conditional on PSA: odds ratios progressively increased with increasing PSA from 0.64 (95% CI: 0.40-1.02) at PSA 5 ng/ml to 39.1 (95% CI: 2.71-566) at 75 ng/ml.  Conclusion:   Higher PSA levels increase the probability of cancer detection with 12-core prostate biopsies, but relative efficiency of different procedures appeared conditional on the PSA level.

On presentation, the dog was nonweight bearing on the right rear limb and the right carpus was diffusely swollen. Synovial fluid analysis from the right carpus revealed a population of epithelial cells displaying marked anisocytosis, anisokaryosis, multinucleation, and prominent, variably sized nucleoli. A metastatic carcinoma with presumed prostatic or urothelial origin was diagnosed based on cytomorphology. Subsequent cytologic evaluation of peripheral lymph nodes revealed the presence of a similar neoplastic population. The dog was euthanized and synovial fluid from both stifle joints, as well as impression smears of the prostate gland, were collected. Carcinoma cells were identified in each stifle joint and in the prostate gland. Immunocytochemistry was performed on synovial fluid smears from 2 of the joints (right stifle and right carpus) and on impression smears of the prostate gland. The neoplastic population in the joints and prostate gland showed strong immunoreactivity to uroplakin III, a urothelial marker, indicating metastasis of a transitional cell carcinoma to multiple joints. In addition, evidence for epithelial to mesenchymal transition was identified using cytokeratin, an epithelial marker, and vimentin, a mesenchymal marker. A necropsy was performed and histopathology confirmed the presence of metastatic transitional cell carcinoma in various tissues. This case illustrates the importance of considering metastatic disease when a patient is presented with severe lameness and joint pain, and the clinical utility of synovial fluid cytology for diagnosis of metastasis in these cases.""","""['Sarah L Colledge', 'Rose E Raskin', 'Joanne B Messick', 'L Tiffany Reed', 'William L Wigle', 'Kelley A Balog']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Vet Clin Pathol""","""['Complex mammary carcinoma with metastases to lymph nodes, subcutaneous tissue, and multiple joints in a dog.', 'Cutaneous metastasis of transitional cell carcinoma in 12 dogs.', 'Metastatic carcinoma presenting as hind-limb lameness: diagnosis by synovial fluid cytology.', 'Synovial cell sarcoma in a dog: A misnomer-Cytologic and histologic findings and review of the literature.', 'Metastatic lymph node collision of a prostatic adenocarcinoma and an urothelial carcinoma and review of the literature.', 'Index case of synovial metastasis in a patient with transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder.', 'Uncommon skeletal metastasis secondary to transitional cell carcinoma.', 'Preanalytical Considerations for Joint Fluid Evaluation.']"""

The purpose of this study was to assess prostate cancer aggressiveness by metabolic profiling of prostatectomy tissue and to identify specific metabolites as biomarkers for aggressiveness. Prostate tissue samples (n = 158, 48 patients) with a high cancer content (mean: 61.8%) were obtained using a new harvesting method, and metabolic profiles of samples representing different Gleason scores (GS) were acquired by high resolution magic angle spinning magnetic resonance spectroscopy (HR-MAS). Multivariate analysis (PLS, PLS-DA) and absolute quantification (LCModel) were used to examine the ability to predict cancer aggressiveness by comparing low grade (GS = 6, n = 30) and high grade (GS≥7, n = 81) cancer with normal adjacent tissue (n = 47). High grade cancer tissue was distinguished from low grade cancer tissue by decreased concentrations of spermine (p = 0.0044) and citrate (p = 7.73·10(-4)), and an increase in the clinically applied (total choline+creatine+polyamines)/citrate (CCP/C) ratio (p = 2.17·10(-4)). The metabolic profiles were significantly correlated to the GS obtained from each tissue sample (r = 0.71), and cancer tissue could be distinguished from normal tissue with sensitivity 86.9% and specificity 85.2%. Overall, our findings show that metabolic profiling can separate aggressive from indolent prostate cancer. This holds promise for the benefit of applying in vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) within clinical MR imaging investigations, and HR-MAS analysis of transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsies has a potential as an additional diagnostic tool.""","""['Guro F Giskeødegård', 'Helena Bertilsson', 'Kirsten M Selnæs', 'Alan J Wright', 'Tone F Bathen', 'Trond Viset', 'Jostein Halgunset', 'Anders Angelsen', 'Ingrid S Gribbestad', 'May-Britt Tessem']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Spatially matched in vivo and ex vivo MR metabolic profiles of prostate cancer -- investigation of a correlation with Gleason score.', 'Ex vivo metabolic fingerprinting identifies biomarkers predictive of prostate cancer recurrence following radical prostatectomy.', 'TE\u2009=\u200932 ms vs TE\u2009=\u2009100 ms echo-time (1)H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy in prostate cancer: Tumor metabolite depiction and absolute concentrations in tumors and adjacent tissues.', 'Novel biomarker for prostate cancer diagnosis by MRS.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Characterization of metabolism-associated molecular patterns in prostate cancer.', 'Role of Metabolism and Metabolic Pathways in Prostate Cancer.', 'Improving the Effective Spatial Resolution in 1H-MRSI of the Prostate with Three-Dimensional Overdiscretized Reconstructions.', 'One-Carbon and Polyamine Metabolism as Cancer Therapy Targets.', 'Metabolic pathways enriched according to ERG status are associated with biochemical recurrence in Hispanic/Latino patients with prostate cancer.']"""

Between 0.1 and 10 mL of whole blood spiked with cells from tumor cell lines were passed through silicon nitride microsieves, polymer track-etched filters and metal TEM grids with various pore sizes. The recovery and size of 9 different culture cell lines was determined and compared to the size of EpCAM+CK+CD45-DNA+ CTC from patients with metastatic breast, colorectal and prostate cancer. The 8 µm track-etched filter and the 5 µm microsieve had the best performance on MDA-231, PC3-9 and SKBR-3 cells, enriching >80% of cells from whole blood. TEM grids had poor recovery of ∼25%. Median diameter of cell lines ranged from 10.9-19.0 µm, compared to 13.1, 10.7, and 11.0 µm for breast, prostate and colorectal CTC, respectively. The 11.4 µm COLO-320 cell line had the lowest recovery of 17%. The ideal filter for CTC enrichment is constructed of a stiff, flat material, is inert to blood cells, has at least 100,000 regularly spaced 5 µm pores for 1 ml of blood with a ≤10% porosity.

We determined Treg target antigens in UC. Fifty-six UC and 13 control patients were prospectively enrolled. Blood was drawn before and after routine treatment. Changes in Treg frequency were measured by fluorescence cytometry and the T effector cell (Teff) response against a set of nine tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) was monitored with an interferon-gamma ELISpot. Antigen specificity of Treg was determined by their increased capacity to inhibit after TAA-specific activation the proliferation of an autologous T cell population. The highest difference in the overall response rate for the total T cell population was observed for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) (UC: 23% and controls: 0%). After depleting Treg, also new york esophageal (NYES)O1 (19 and 0%) and MUC20 (27 and 0%) were more frequently recognized in UC patients. In metastasized patients, the TAA-directed T cell response was augmented by Treg depletion. Tumor resection seemed to diminish Treg suppression of TAA-specific immunity, whereas chemotherapy had no effect. We demonstrated the existence of TAA-specific Treg in UC, which share antigen specificities with Teff. The coexistence of TAA-specific Treg and Teff was very rare. Treg frequencies in the peripheral blood were not changed by therapy. In summary, we identified potentially immunologically relevant TAA in UC.

Galectin-3 is a tumor-associated protein; present in the seminal fluid and is a substrate for the PSA enzyme e.g., a chymotrypsin-like serine protease. We hypothesized that the cleavage status and level of galectin-3 in the prostate tissue and sera are associated with PCa. Thus, we compared galectin-3 levels obtained from sera of non-cancer urology patients to those of metastatic PCa patients. The data were confirmed by analyzing PCa tissue arrays. Here, we report that galectin-3 levels in the sera of patients with metastatic PCa were uniformly higher as compared to the non-cancer patient controls.

Thus, there is a strong imperative to identify mechanisms other than antioxidant protection to account for selenium's anti-cancer activity. In vivo work in dogs showed that dietary selenium supplementation decreased DNA damage but increased apoptosis in the prostate, leading to a new hypothesis: Organic selenium exerts its cancer preventive effect by selectively increasing apoptosis in DNA-damaged cells. Here, we test whether organic selenium (methylseleninic acid; MSA) triggers more apoptosis in human and canine prostate cancer cells that have more DNA damage (strand breaks) created by hydrogen-peroxide (H₂O₂) at noncytotoxic doses prior to MSA exposure. Apoptosis triggered by MSA was significantly higher in H₂O₂-damaged cells. A supra-additive effect was observed--the extent of MSA-triggered apoptosis in H₂O₂-damaged cells exceeded the sum of apoptosis induced by MSA or H₂O₂ alone. However, neither the persistence of H₂O₂-induced DNA damage, nor the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases was required to sensitize cells to MSA-triggered apoptosis. Our results document that selenium can exert a ""homeostatic housecleaning"" effect--a preferential elimination of DNA-damaged cells.

We report our experience with the use of HBOT for recurrent radiation-induced acute bowel obstruction.  Methods:   This is a retrospective case series. Radiological imaging had excluded the presence of recurrent or new cancer. Possible predisposing causes for acute obstruction had been treated and had not led to resolution of symptoms or had been excluded.  Results:   During 2007-2010, five patients with recurrent episodes of acute obstructive bowel symptoms following previous therapeutic pelvic irradiation were referred for HBOT (four females and one male; median age 56; range 48-72). The primary tumours sites were the endometrium (n = 2), ovary, cervix and prostate (n = 1 each), and patients were treated 2-17 (median 9) years previously with radiotherapy. Before HBOT, patients were experiencing acute obstructive bowel symptoms at 1-6 weekly intervals. Four patients had progressive weight loss. Patients received 100 % oxygen in a multiplace hyperbaric chamber at a pressure of 2.4 atm absolute for up to 90 min once a day, 5 to 7 days weekly. All patients were initially referred for 40 sessions of HBOT. Three patients required a further extra 20 sessions for complete resolution of bowel symptoms. HBOT was well tolerated with no side effects. Patients have remained well after 6-24 months of follow-up.

Methods:   Forty-one men (M age=66.62 years; SD=9.62) who had undergone radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy for localized prostate cancer within two years completed questionnaires, including assessments of EAC, at T1, and provided blood samples for immune assessments at T2.  Results:   When controlling for relevant biobehavioral controls, emotional processing predicted lower IL-6 (B=-.66, p<.01), sTNF-RII (B=-.43, p<.05), and CRP (B=-.43, p<.10), whereas emotional expression was significantly associated with higher levels of sTNF-RII (B=.55, p<.05). Associations of emotional expression and IL-6 (B=.38, p<.10), and CRP (B=.44, p<.10) approached significance. Probing interactions of emotional processing and expression (though only approaching significance) suggested that expression of emotion is associated with higher inflammation (CRP and sTNF-RII) only in the context of low emotional processing.  Conclusions:   Attempts at emotion regulation via emotional processing appear to modulate inflammatory processes. Understanding, making meaning of, and working through emotional experience may be a promising target of intervention to reduce inflammation with potential effects on psychological and cancer outcomes in men with prostate cancer.""","""['Michael A Hoyt', 'Annette L Stanton', 'Julienne E Bower', 'KaMala S Thomas', 'Mark S Litwin', 'Elizabeth C Breen', 'Michael R Irwin']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Brain Behav Immun""","""['Cancer-related masculine threat, emotional approach coping, and physical functioning following treatment for prostate cancer.', 'Approach and avoidance coping: diurnal cortisol rhythm in prostate cancer survivors.', 'From childhood trauma to elevated C-reactive protein in adulthood: the role of anxiety and emotional eating.', 'Coping through emotional approach: a new look at emotion, coping, and health-related outcomes.', 'Coping with prostate cancer: a meta-analytic review.', 'The influence of lifestyle changes (diet, exercise and stress reduction) on prostate cancer tumour biology and patient outcomes: A systematic review.', 'A Randomized Controlled Trial of Goal-Focused Emotion-Regulation Therapy for Young Adult Survivors of Testicular Cancer: Effects on Salivary and Inflammatory Stress Markers.', 'FAM64A is an androgen receptor-regulated feedback tumor promoter in prostate cancer.', 'Emotions matter: The role of emotional approach coping in chronic pain.', 'Transitions in coping profiles after breast cancer diagnosis: implications for depressive and physical symptoms.']"""

Although Cyr61 was found by us to be overproduced in androgen-independent PC-3 cells treated with N-acetylcysteine (NAC), its significance is still unclear. We therefore aimed to determine how and why Cyr61 protein is overexpressed in NAC-treated cells. Here, we found that Cyr61 protein level markedly increased in cells treated with NAC at high cell seeding density. Silencing of Cyr61 by siRNA induced enhanced activity of caspase-3/7, upregulation of the proapototic Bok, BimL and BimS, cleavage of apoptosis hallmarkers such as Bax, PARP and caspase-3, and downregulation of antiapoptotic Bcl2, Bcl-xL and Mcl-1 proteins. NAC treatment caused a reduction of extracellular medium pH to acidic and an increase in Akt phosphorylation, after which the replacement with NAC-free medium returned them to control levels within 24h. Acid stimulation increased the levels of Cyr61 and p-Akt proteins, whereas it suppressed the induction of proapoptotic and antiapoptotic proteins.

Materials and methods:   All eligible patients in the South Australian (SA) Prostate Cancer Clinical Outcomes registry were followed. 848 Patients treated by definitive EBRT with more than one PSA recorded in the two year post-treatment were included. We calculated PSAV by linear regression.  Results:   The mean number of PSA measurements in the 2year period was 4.4 (SD1.9). The median PSAVs across quartiles (Q1-Q4) were -4.17, -1.29, -0.38 and 0.20ng/ml/yr. In multivariable analysis, a U-shaped relationship was seen between PSAV and PCSM with Q1-Q4 hazard ratios (HR) being 3.82 (1.46-10.00), 3.07 (1.10-8.58), 1, 5.15 (1.99-13.30) respectively.

A rapid PSA decline in the first year was a strong predictor of PCSM. However, in the second year PSA increase was positively associated with PCSM.  Conclusion:   A rapid decline in PSA in the first year following EBRT is positively associated with PCSM.

Materials and methods:   We used a sample collected by the French cancer registries of 1840 cases (T1: 583; T2: 1257) diagnosed in 2001. The proportion of over-diagnosed and over-treated patients was estimated by comparing life expectancy (LE), including or not comorbidities, with natural LE with cancer, using several assumptions from the literature. We distinguished potential and actual over-treatment according to the treatment that patients actually received.  Results:   Among patients with T1 tumors the proportion of potential over-treatment using LE adjusted for comorbidity varied from 29.5% to 53.5%, using LE adjusted on comorbidities, and varied from 9.3% to 22.2% regarding actual over-treatment. Between 7.7% and 24.4% of patient's receiving a radical prostatectomy, and between 30.8% and 62.5% of those receiving radiotherapy, were over-treated. Among patients with T2 tumors, the proportions of potential and actual over-treatment were 0.9% and 2.0%. Two per cent of patients receiving a radical prostatectomy and 4.9% of those receiving radiotherapy were over-treated. Comorbidities dramatically increased these proportions to nearly 100% of patients, with more than two comorbidities being potentially over-treated and around 33% actually over-treated.

We propose a system to leverage the IMRT planning experience of larger institutions to automatically create high-quality plans for outside clinics. We explore feasibility by generating plans for patient datasets from an outside institution by adapting plans from our institution.  Methods and materials:   A knowledge database was created from 132 IMRT treatment plans for prostate cancer at our institution. The outside institution, a community hospital, provided the datasets for 55 prostate cancer cases, including their original treatment plans. For each ""query"" case from the outside institution, a similar ""match"" case was identified in the knowledge database, and the match case's plan parameters were then adapted and optimized to the query case by use of a semiautomated approach that required no expert planning knowledge. The plans generated with this knowledge-based approach were compared with the original treatment plans at several dose cutpoints.  Results:   Compared with the original plan, the knowledge-based plan had a significantly more homogeneous dose to the planning target volume and a significantly lower maximum dose. The volumes of the rectum, bladder, and femoral heads above all cutpoints were nominally lower for the knowledge-based plan; the reductions were significantly lower for the rectum. In 40% of cases, the knowledge-based plan had overall superior (lower) dose-volume histograms for rectum and bladder; in 54% of cases, the comparison was equivocal; in 6% of cases, the knowledge-based plan was inferior for both bladder and rectum.  Conclusions:   Knowledge-based planning was superior or equivalent to the original plan in 95% of cases.

Plans were averaged across the 10 patients and compared for mean dose, conformity, homogeneity, rectal and bladder doses, and monitor units.

Materials and methods:   The CTCs were enumerated using the CellSearch Food and Drug Administration-cleared CTC kit in 202 patients with prostate cancer. Variables, including metastatic site, prostate-specific antigen level, Gleason score, testosterone level, and use of androgen treatment, were tested for association with the CTC number. The probability of patient survival over time was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.  Results:   The baseline CTC numbers were strongly associated with survival (P <.0001), with overall survival significantly poorer in patients with ≥5 CTCs. Significantly greater CTC numbers were observed in patients with bone metastasis (mean 41.12 CTCs) than in those with lymph node metastasis (mean 2.53 CTC, P = .026). Analysis of the association between the CTC count and prostate-specific antigen level revealed a weak positive correlation (correlation coefficient r = 0.2695, P = .0007).

Much of the justification for its adoption was derived from earlier clinical results using high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy. We determine whether HDR's dosimetry can be achieved by virtual SBRT.  Methods and materials:   Patients with intermediate-risk prostate cancer on a prospective trial evaluating the efficacy of HDR monotherapy treated to dose of 9.5Gy×4 fractions were used for this study. A total of 5 patients were used in this analysis. Virtual SBRT plans were developed to reproduce the planning target volume (PTV) HDR dose distributions. Both normal tissue- and PTV-prioritized plans were generated.  Results:   From the normal tissue-prioritized plan, HDR and virtual SBRT achieved similar PTV V100 (93.8% vs. 93.1%, p=0.20) and V150 (40.3% vs. 42.9%, p=0.69) coverage. However, the PTV V200 was not attainable with SBRT (15.2% vs. 0.0%, p<0.001). The rectal Dmax was significantly lower with HDR (94.2% vs. 99.42%, p=0.05). The rectal D2 cc was also lower (60.8% vs. 71.1%, p=0.07). Difference in D1 cc urethral dose was not significantly different (87.7% vs. 75.2%, p=0.33). Comparing the PTV-prioritized plans, the rectal Dmax (94.2% vs. 111.1%, p=0.05) and mean dose (27.1% vs. 33.3%, p=0.03) were significantly higher using SBRT, and the rectal D2 cc was higher using SBRT (60.8% vs. 81.8%, p=0.07).

However, the enhanced visibility of the apex during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) may obviate this need, allowing for the preservation of maximal urethral length. We assessed pathologic findings of routine apical margin biopsy intraoperative frozen section (IFS) during RARP.  Patients and methods:   The Columbia University Robotic Database was retrospectively reviewed to identify men who underwent RARP with biopsy of the apical soft tissue (urethroprostatic junction). Both IFS and permanent section samples were analyzed. The clinical characteristics associated with IFS and permanent section histological findings were assessed.  Results:   In total, 335 men underwent RARP with apical biopsy from December 2007 to August 2011. Of these, 329 had IFS available for analysis. Median age and prostate-specific antigen level were 60 years (range, 42-78 years) and 5.2 ng/mL (interquartile range, 4.1-6.9 ng/mL), respectively. Of the 329 apical IFS cases, cancer was detected in 9 patients (2.7%), benign prostatic glands in 135 (41%), and nonprostatic tissue in 185 (56.3%). On permanent section, cancer was seen in 9 patients (2.7%), benign prostatic glands in 125 (38%), and nonprostatic tissue in 195 (59.3%). False-positive and false-negative rates of detecting cancer on IFS were 33% (3/9) and 1% (3/320), respectively. The overall positive surgical margin rate was 11%.  Conclusions:   Cancer is rarely detected by IFS analysis of routine biopsy of the apical margin during RARP. Although routine IFS may not be beneficial for all patients, selective utilization of IFS may be useful in directing apical dissection in men with apical tumors, allowing for the preservation of maximal urethral length.""","""['Chris O Wambi', 'Trushar Patel', 'Edan Y Shapiro', 'Oded Tal', 'Greg W Hruby', 'William T Berg', 'Mitchell C Benson', 'Ketan K Badani']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Laparoendosc Adv Surg Tech A""","""['Laparoscopic radical prostatectomy: the value of intraoperative frozen sections.', 'Robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: Multiparametric MR imaging-directed intraoperative frozen-section analysis to reduce the rate of positive surgical margins.', 'Role of intraoperative biopsies during radical retropubic prostatectomy.', 'Robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: inching toward gold standard.', 'Fine-tuning robot-assisted radical prostatectomy planning with MRI.']"""

For this, the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) derived from diffusion-weighted MR imaging (DWI) seems a useful tool. On voxel level, the relationship between ADC and histological presence of tumour is, however, ambiguous. Therefore, in this study the relationship between ADC and histological variables was investigated on voxel level to understand the strengths and limitations of DWI for prostate tumour delineation.  Material and methods:   Twelve radical prostatectomy patients underwent a pre-operative 3.0T DWI exam and the ADC was calculated. From whole-mount histological sections cell density and glandular area were retrieved for every voxel. The distribution of all variables was described for tumour, peripheral zone (PZ) and central gland (CG) on regional and voxel level. Correlations between variables and differences between regions were calculated.  Results:   Large heterogeneity of ADC on voxel level was observed within tumours, between tumours and between patients. This heterogeneity was reflected by the distribution of cell density and glandular area. On regional level, tumour was different from PZ having higher cell density (p = 0.007), less glandular area (p = 0.017) and lower ADCs (p = 0.017). ADC was correlated with glandular area (r = 0.402) and tumour volume (r = -0.608), but not with Gleason score. ADC tended to decrease with increasing cell density (r = -0.327, p = 0.073). On voxel level, correlations between ADC and histological variables varied among patients, for cell density ranging from r = -0.439 to r = 0.261 and for glandular area from r = 0.593 to r = 0.207.  Conclusions:   The variation in ADC can to a certain extent be explained by the variation in cell density and glandular area. The ADC is highly heterogeneous, which reflects the heterogeneity of malignant and benign prostate tissue. This heterogeneity might however obscure small tumours or parts of tumours.

Since the inventory of downregulated genes is incomplete, we performed in silico approaches to reveal the novel prostate cancer downregulated genes. Moreover, we also investigated for a possible link between the expression of the downregulated genes and tumor grade, recurrence, metastasis, or survival status in prostate cancer. Our results showed that the expression of GSTP1 and AOX1 are downregulated in prostate cancer, in concordance with previous reports.

Metformin is the most widely used anti-diabetic drug in the world, and there is increasing evidence of a potential efficacy of this agent as an anti-cancer drug. Metformin inhibits the proliferation of a range of cancer cells including prostate, colon, breast, ovarian, and glioma lines. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small, non- coding, single-stranded RNAs that downregulate gene expression. We aimed to evaluate the effects of metformin treatment on changes in miRNA expression in PC-3 cells, and possible associations with biological behaviour.  Materials and methods:   Average cell viability and cytotoxic effects of metformin were investigated at 24 hour intervals for three days using the xCELLigence system. The IC50 dose of metformin in the PC-3 cells was found to be 5 mM. RNA samples were used for analysis using custom multi-species microarrays containing 1209 probes covering 1221 human mature microRNAs present in miRBase 16.0 database.  Results:   Among the human miRNAs investigated by the arrays, 10 miRNAs were up-regulated and 12 miRNAs were down-regulated in the metformin-treated group as compared to the control group. In conclusion, expression changes in miRNAs of miR-146a, miR-100, miR-425, miR-193a-3p and, miR-106b in metformin-treated cells may be important.

Therefore, genetic variation in genes of enzymes which are involved could be of importance. The gene most interest is CYP17, whose enzyme product has an essential role in testosterone hormone synthesis. Some studies have indicated that the A2 allele polymorphism of CYP17 associated with increased risk of prostate cancer that could be affected by ethnicity. Therefore, the aim of this study was determination of presence or absence of the A2 allele in patients with prostate cancer.  Materials and methods:   We studied the association of A2 allele and prostate cancer among 74 patients with prostate cancer and 128 healthy men which were referred to hospitals of SBMU.  Results:   This study revealed a significant association between prostate cancer risk and the A2 allele in an Iranian population so that A1A2 and A2A2 genotypes were more common in cases than controls with P-values of 0.029 and 0.010, respectively.  Conclusions:   Results of our study support a possible role of the A2 allele in sporadic prostate cancer development in Iran, in line with findings elsewhere.""","""['Arezu Karimpur-Zahmatkesh', 'Farah Farzaneh', 'Farkhondeh Pouresmaeili', 'Jalil Hosseini', 'Eznollah Azarghashb', 'Mohammad Yaghoobi']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Asian Pac J Cancer Prev""","""['The relationship between a polymorphism in CYP17 with plasma hormone levels and prostate cancer.', 'Increased risk of prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia associated with a CYP17 gene polymorphism with a gene dosage effect.', 'A polymorphism in the CYP17 gene is associated with prostate cancer risk.', 'CYP17 polymorphisms in relation to risks of prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia: a population-based study in China.', 'Association of the CYP17 gene polymorphism with the risk of prostate cancer: a meta-analysis.', 'Genetic polymorphisms in the androgen metabolism pathway and risk of prostate cancer in low incidence Malaysian ethnic groups.']"""

Especially, MMP-2 has been shown to be related with benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer. Therefore, there is a need to make sensors with high sensitivity that can measure MMP-2 concentrations precisely. Silicon nanowires have been used in the development of high sensitive chemical sensors and biosensors. The high sensitivity of silicon nanowire based sensor originates in its high surface to volume ratio and ability to field-effect induced local charge transfers. In this study, 100 nm silicon nanowire based field-effect transistors (FET) device was fabricated by electron-beam lithography and MMP-2 was successfully measured by conductance versus time characteristics within 1 pM to 100 nM.""","""['Jin-Ha Choi', 'Han Kim', 'Hyun-Soo Kim', 'Soong Ho Um', 'Jeong-Woo Choi', 'Byung-Keun Oh']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Biomed Nanotechnol""","""['Signal enhancement of silicon nanowire-based biosensor for detection of matrix metalloproteinase-2 using DNA-Au nanoparticle complexes.', 'Effect of nanowire number, diameter, and doping density on nano-FET biosensor sensitivity.', 'Silicon Nanowire Field Effect Transistor Sensors with Minimal Sensor-to-Sensor Variations and Enhanced Sensing Characteristics.', 'Silicon nanowire field-effect-transistor based biosensors: from sensitive to ultra-sensitive.', 'Process Variability in Top-Down Fabrication of Silicon Nanowire-Based Biosensor Arrays.', 'Relation of Mean Platelet Volume (MPV) with Cancer: A Systematic Review with a Focus on Disease Outcome on Twelve Types of Cancer.', 'Rational Design of Field-Effect Sensors Using Partial Differential Equations, Bayesian Inversion, and Artificial Neural Networks.', 'Electrochemical sensory detection of Sus scrofa mtDNA for food adulteration using hybrid ferrocenylnaphthalene diimide intercalator as a hybridization indicator.', 'Biosensing based on field-effect transistors (FET): Recent progress and challenges.', 'Enhanced and Prolonged Antitumor Effect of Salinomycin-Loaded Gelatinase-Responsive Nanoparticles via Targeted Drug Delivery and Inhibition of Cervical Cancer Stem Cells.']"""

The prepared nanoparticles showed a size of 80-120 nm with an entrapment efficiency of 55 +/- 6.95%. In addition, blood compatibility, in vitro cytotoxicity, drug release and cellular uptake studies were also carried out. The drug release studies showed a sustained and pH dependent release pattern as a result, after 120 h about 66% drug release occurred at pH 7.4 and 78% release occurred in acidic pH. MTT (3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) and LDH (lactate dehydrogenase) experiments proved the preferential toxicity of drug loaded nanoparticles towards prostate cancer cells (PC3) unlike in normal cells, mouse fibroblast cells (L929). The cell death mechanism of drug loaded nanoparticles for a concentration of 50 and 75 nM showed 28 +/- 2 and 35.2 +/- 4% apoptosis in samples treated with the PC3 cells after 24 h. Fluorescent microscopic imaging and flow cytometry confirmed the preferential uptake of the nanoparticles (NPs) in the prostate cancer cells (PC3) unlike in normal (L929) cells. Hence the developed FLT loaded CS-DS NPs could be used as a promising system for controlled delivery in prostate cancer.""","""['A Anitha', 'Saji Uthaman', 'Shantikumar V Nair', 'R Jayakumar', 'Vinoth-Kumar Lakshmanan']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Biomed Nanotechnol""","""['Hydrophobic lapatinib encapsulated dextran-chitosan nanoparticles using a toxic solvent free method: fabrication, release property & in vitro anti-cancer activity.', 'Assessment of Poly (vinyl alcohol) Coated Flutamide Nanoparticulates and their Efficacy on Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Curcumin loaded fibrinogen nanoparticles for cancer drug delivery.', 'Folate-Targeted Polyacrylamide/Punicic Acid Nanomicelles for Flutamide Delivery in Prostate Cancer: Characterization, In Vitro Biological Evaluation, and its DFT Study.', 'Curcumin-loaded biocompatible thermoresponsive polymeric nanoparticles for cancer drug delivery.']"""
