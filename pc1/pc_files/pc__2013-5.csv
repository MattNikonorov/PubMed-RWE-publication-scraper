In this report, we use data from the Rhode Island Cancer Registry to look at commonly occurring metachronous cancers, their frequency over time, and the implications for cancer survivorship. Sequence two (refers to the chronologically second primary tumor diagnosed for a given patient) and higher primary malignant neoplasms were identified in cancer case reports made to the Rhode Island Cancer Registry, 1987-2009, and used to construct annual, age-adjusted, sequence-specific incidence rates for all cancers combined, and age-adjusted, site-specific incidence rates for common second and higher-order primary malignant neoplasms over the entire observational period. During the period of observation, the proportion of all cancers diagnosed as sequence two and higher primary tumors among males increased steadily from 11.5 to 20.3 percent, while the proportion of all cancers diagnosed as sequence two and higher primary tumors among females increased from 12.8 to 20.7 percent. A mere four cancer types--lung (and bronchus), colon (and rectum), breast, and prostate--account for over half of all sequence two and higher cancer diagnoses (54.3 percent). The average interval between first cancers and second cancers is 6.5 years for men and 4.8 years for women. Such is the ""career"" of a cancer survivor today that he or she has about a one in four chance of developing a second cancer. This statistic suggests the need for strong and lasting social support networks. Furthermore, the average interval between first and second cancers is substantial, and suggests opportunities for interventions (prevention and screening) that might reduce the burden of sequence two and higher cancers.""","""['Arvin S Glicksman', 'John P Fulton']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""R I Med J (2013)""","""['Prophylactic Oophorectomy: Reducing the U.S. Death Rate from Epithelial Ovarian Cancer.

The 4FISH-IF assay contains four probes complementary to chromosome 8 centromere, 8p telomere, 8p21, and 8q24, as well as an antibody targeting the basal cell marker p63 visualized by immunofluorescence. The major advantages of the 4FISH-IF include the distinction between benign and malignant glands directly on the 4FISH-IF slide and the control of truncation artifact. Importantly, this specialized and innovative combined multiprobe and immunofluorescence technique can be performed on diagnostic biopsy specimens, increasing its clinical relevance. Moreover, the assay can be easily performed in a standard clinical molecular pathology laboratory.

Thus, in the present study, the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in association with AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathways was demonstrated in beta-sitosterol-treated multiple myeloma U266 cells. Beta-sitosterol exerted cytotoxicity, increased sub-G1 apoptotic population and activated caspase-9 and -3, cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) followed by decrease in mitochondrial potential in U266 cells. Beta-sitosterol promoted ROS production, activated AMPK, acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and JNK in U266 cells. Also, beta-sitosterol attenuated the phosphorylation of AKT, mammalian target of rapamycin and S6K, and the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 and VEGF in U266 cells. Conversely, AMPK inhibitor compound C and JNK inhibitor SP600125 suppressed apoptosis induced by beta-sitosterol in U266 cells. Furthermore, ROS scavenger N-acetyl L-cysteine attenuated beta-sitosterol-mediated sub-G1 accumulation, PARP cleavage, JNK and AMPK activation in U266 cells.

Our objective was to analyze the influence of sex steroids levels on BTM in patients with PCa treated with or without ADT. We performed a cross-sectional study including 83 subjects with PCa (54% with ADT). BTM, bone mineral density (BMD), and sex steroids were determined. BTM were inversely related to serum level of estrogens. Tartrate-specific acid phosphatase (TRAP-5b) showed a negative correlation with free estradiol (Free E) (r = -0.274, p = 0.014) and Bio E (r = -0.256, p = 0.022) that remained after adjustment for age: Free E (β = -0.241, p = 0.03) and Bio E (β = -0.213, p = 0.063). Bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP) concentrations were inversely related to Free E (r = -0.281, p = 0.011, age-adjusted β = -0.256, p = 0.024). There was a negative correlation between osteocalcin (OC) levels and Free E (r = -0.195, p = 0.082; age-adjusted β = -0.203, p = 0.076) and Bio E (r = -0.215, p = 0.054; age-adjusted β = -0.240, p = 0.039). BTM and androgens were inversely related to TRAP-5b: total testosterone (total T) (r = -0.238, p = 0.033), Free T (r = -0.309, p = 0.05), and Bio T (r = -0.310, p = 0.05), but these correlations disappeared after age-adjustment. We did not find any relationship between BMD at different locations and sex steroids. In conclusion, in patients with PCa, estrogen levels influence bone resorption and bone formation whereas androgens may exert actions only in bone resorption. These results suggest that estradiol is the main sex steroid that regulates bone metabolism in males with prostate carcinoma.""","""['Mariela Varsavsky', 'Rebeca Reyes-García', 'Antonia García-Martín', 'Pedro Rozas-Moreno', 'Rocío González-Ramírez', 'Manuel Muñoz-Torres']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Bone Miner Metab""","""['Sclerostin serum levels in prostate cancer patients and their relationship with sex steroids.', 'Endogenous sex steroid, GH and IGF-I levels in normal elderly men: relationships with bone mineral density and markers of bone turnover.', 'Serum osteoprotegerin and sex steroid levels in patients with prostate cancer.', 'Sex steroid metabolism in the regulation of bone health in men.', 'Corticosteroid-induced bone loss in men.', 'Effect of androgen deprivation therapy on bone mineral density in patients with prostate cancer.', 'The effect of testosterone itself and in combination with letrozole on bone mineral density in male rats.', 'Effect of Androgen Deprivation Therapy on Bone Mineral Density in a Prostate Cancer Cohort in New Zealand: A Pilot Study.', 'Preservation of volumetric bone density and geometry in trans women during cross-sex hormonal therapy: a prospective observational study.']"""

Prostate cancer-associated ncRNA transcripts 1 (PCAT-1), a lncRNA, has been recently revealed involving in human prostate cancer progression. However, whether PCAT-1 could serve as novel biomarker to predict prognosis in colorectal cancer (CRC) or not is unknown. We therefore carried out the present study to explore the correlation between PCAT-1 expression and the progression of CRC. In this study, the expression of PCAT-1 in 108 cases of CRC tissues and matched 81 adjacent normal tissues were determined by quantitative real-time PCR. Furthermore, the copy number variation of PCAT-1 was also measured in 17 tumor tissues and matched normal tissues. Our results showed that PCAT-1 expression in CRC tissues was significantly upregulated compared with the matched normal tissues (p < 0.001) and the overexpression of PCAT-1(upregulated by more than 50 %) was found in 64 % (62/81) of CRC. Moreover, PCAT-1 gene copy number variation explains only a few percent of observed overexpression. In addition, there was a significant association between PCAT-1 expression and distant metastasis (p = 0.04), but not other clinical characteristics. More important, CRC patients with PCAT-1 higher expression have shown significantly poorer overall survival than those with lower PCAT-1 expression (p < 0.001). Also, multivariable Cox regression analysis identified PCAT-1 overexpression as an independent prognostic factor for CRC (p = 0.007, HR = 3.12 95 %CI = 1.355-7.185). In conclusion, our results suggest that high expression of PCAT-1 is involved in CRC progression and could be a novel biomarker of poor prognosis in patient with colorectal cancer.""","""['Xiaosong Ge', 'Yuanbin Chen', 'Xiaoyu Liao', 'Deqing Liu', 'Fangfang Li', 'Honglian Ruan', 'Weihua Jia']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Med Oncol""","""['Over-expression of lncRNA DANCR is associated with advanced tumor progression and poor prognosis in patients with colorectal cancer.', 'Upregulation of the long noncoding RNA PCAT-1 correlates with advanced clinical stage and poor prognosis in esophageal squamous carcinoma.', 'Upregulation of lncRNA BANCR associated with the lymph node metastasis and poor prognosis in colorectal cancer.', 'Association of long non-coding RNA HOTTIP with progression and prognosis in colorectal cancer.', 'Improving diagnosis, prognosis and prediction by using biomarkers in CRC patients (Review).', 'From Omic Layers to Personalized Medicine in Colorectal Cancer: The Road Ahead.', 'Unlocking the potential of non-coding RNAs in cancer research and therapy.', 'Targeting lncRNAs of colorectal cancers with natural products.', 'Exosomal lncRNA PCAT1 Promotes Tumor Circulating Cell-Mediated Colorectal Cancer Liver Metastasis by Regulating the Activity of the miR-329-3p/Netrin-1-CD146 Complex.', 'Apoptosis evasion via long non-coding RNAs in colorectal cancer.']"""

Similarly to (125)I or (103)Pd seed brachytherapy, (90)Y-avidin could be injected via the perineum under ultrasound image guidance. This study inspects the theoretical feasibility with a dosimetric model based on Monte Carlo simulation.  Methods:   A geometrical model of the prostate, urethra and rectum was designed. The linear-quadratic model was applied to convert (125)I absorbed dose prescription/constraints into (90)Y dose through biological effective dose (BED) calculation. The optimal (90)Y-avidin injection strategy for the present model was obtained. Dose distribution was calculated by Monte Carlo simulation (PENELOPE,GEANT4). Dose volume histograms (DVH) for the prostate, urethra and rectum were compared to typical DVHs of (125)I seed brachytherapy, used routinely in our institute.  Results:   With (90)Y-avidin, at least 95% of the prostate must receive more than 70 Gy. The absorbed dose to 10% of the urethra (D(10%_urethra)) and the maximum absorbed dose to the rectum (D(max_rectum)) must be lower than 122 Gy. For the present model, the optimum strategy consists in multiple injections of (90)Y-avidin 50 μl drops, for a total volume of 3.1 ml. The minimum activity to deliver the prescribed absorbed dose is 0.7 GBq, which also fully respects urethral and rectal constraints. The resulting dose map has a maximum in the central region with a sharp decrease towards the urethra and the prostate edge. Notably, D(10%_urethra) is 95 Gy and D(max_rectum) is below 2 Gy. Prostate absorbed dose is higher with (90)Y-avidin than (125)I seeds, although the total volume receiving the prescribed absorbed dose is 1-2% lower. Urethral DVH strictly depends on the (90)Y distribution, to be optimized according to prostate shape; in our model, BED(30%_urethra) is 90 Gy with (90)Y-avidin, whereas for patients receiving (125)I seeds it ranges between 150 and 230 Gy. The rectal DVH is always more favourable with (90)Y.  Conclusion:   The methodology is theoretically feasible and can deliver an effective treatment in T1-T2 prostate cancer. Pharmacokinetic and biodistribution studies in prostate cancer patients are needed for validation.""","""['Francesca Botta', 'Marta Cremonesi', 'Mahila E Ferrari', 'Ernesto Amato', 'Francesco Guerriero', 'Andrea Vavassori', 'Anna Sarnelli', 'Stefano Severi', 'Guido Pedroli', 'Giovanni Paganelli']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging""","""['Interventional nuclear medicine.', 'Dose escalation in permanent brachytherapy for prostate cancer: dosimetric and biological considerations.', 'Prostate seed implantation using 3D-computer assisted intraoperative planning vs. a standard look-up nomogram: Improved target conformality with reduction in urethral and rectal wall dose.', 'Acute genitourinary toxicity after high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy combined with hypofractionated external-beam radiation therapy for localized prostate cancer: correlation between the urethral dose in HDR brachytherapy and the severity of acute genitourinary toxicity.', 'Dosimetric and radiobiological investigation of permanent implant prostate brachytherapy based on Monte Carlo calculations.', 'Dosimetric evaluation of high-dose-rate interstitial brachytherapy boost treatments for localized prostate cancer.', 'After low and high dose-rate interstitial brachytherapy followed by IMRT radiotherapy for intermediate and high risk prostate cancer.', 'An analytical model for calculating internal dose conversion coefficients for non-human biota.', 'Interventional nuclear medicine.']"""

Our method avoids the definition of safety-margins by directly including the effect of geometrical uncertainties during optimization when objective functions are evaluated. Because the shape of the resulting dose distribution implicitly defines the robustness of the plan, the optimizer has much more flexibility than with a margin-based approach. We expect that this added flexibility helps to automatically strike a better balance between target coverage and dose reduction for surrounding healthy tissue, especially for cases where the planning target volume overlaps organs at risk. Prostate cancer treatment planning was chosen to develop our method, including a novel technique to include rotational uncertainties. Based on population statistics, translations and rotations are simulated independently following a marker-based IGRT correction strategy. The effects of random and systematic errors are incorporated by first blurring and then shifting the dose distribution with respect to the clinical target volume. For simplicity and efficiency, dose-shift invariance and a rigid-body approximation are assumed. Three prostate cases were replanned using our probabilistic objective functions. To compare clinical and probabilistic plans, an evaluation tool was used that explicitly incorporates geometric uncertainties using Monte-Carlo methods. The new plans achieved similar or better dose distributions than the original clinical plans in terms of expected target coverage and rectum wall sparing. Plan optimization times were only about a factor of two higher than in the original clinical system. In conclusion, we have developed a practical planning tool that enables margin-less probability-based treatment planning with acceptable planning times, achieving the first system that is feasible for clinical implementation.""","""['Román Bohoslavsky', 'Marnix G Witte', 'Tomas M Janssen', 'Marcel van Herk']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Treatment plan comparison between helical tomotherapy and MLC-based IMRT using radiobiological measures.', 'IMRT optimization including random and systematic geometric errors based on the expectation of TCP and NTCP.', 'Volumetric modulated arc therapy: planning and evaluation for prostate cancer cases.', ""Practical aspects of inverse-planned intensity-modulated radiation therapy for prostate cancer: a radiation treatment planner's perspective."", 'Robustness Analysis for External Beam Radiation Therapy Treatment Plans: Describing Uncertainty Scenarios and Reporting Their Dosimetric Consequences.', 'Parametric delineation uncertainties contouring (PDUC) modeling on CT scans of prostate cancer patients.', 'Voxel-level biological optimisation of prostate IMRT using patient-specific tumour location and clonogen density derived from mpMRI.', 'Dose escalation in the definite target volume.', 'Progress towards Patient-Specific, Spatially-Continuous Radiobiological Dose Prescription and Planning in Prostate Cancer IMRT: An Overview.', 'Dose prescription with spatial uncertainty for peripheral lung SBRT.']"""

Consequently, this effect can be inhibited pharmacologically by clinically established beta-blockers. Tumour cell migration is a prerequisite for metastasis formation, and accordingly we and others have shown that breast cancer patients, which take beta-blockers due to hypertension, have reduced metastasis formation and increased survival probability as compared to patients without hypertension or using other anti-hypertensive medication. Unlike the aforementioned tumour cells, pancreatic cancer cells show a reduced migratory activity upon norepinephrine treatment. By means of our three-dimensional, collagen-based cell migration assay, we have investigated the signal transduction pathways involved in this phenomenon. We have found that this conflicting effect of norepinephrine on pancreatic cancer cells is due to an imbalanced activation of the two pathways that usually mediate a pro-migratory effect of norepinephrine in other tumour cell types. Firstly, the inhibitory effect results from activation of a pathway which causes a strong increase of the secondary cell signalling molecule, cAMP. In addition, activation of phospholipase C gamma and the downstream protein kinase C alpha were shown to be already activated in pancreatic cancer cells and cannot be further activated by norepinephrine. We hypothesize that this constitutive activation of the phospholipase C gamma pathway is due to a cross-talk with receptor tyrosine kinase signalling, and this might also deliver an explanation for the unusual high spontaneous migratory activity of pancreatic cancer cells.""","""['Anna-Maria Stock', 'Desmond G Powe', 'Stephan A Hahn', 'Gabriele Troost', 'Bernd Niggemann', 'Kurt S Zänker', 'Frank Entschladen']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Exp Cell Res""","""['The inhibitory effect of norepinephrine on the migration of ES-2 ovarian carcinoma cells involves a Rap1-dependent pathway.', 'Carvedilol suppresses migration and invasion of malignant breast cells by inactivating Src involving cAMP/PKA and PKCδ signaling pathway.', 'The neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid is an inhibitory regulator for the migration of SW 480 colon carcinoma cells.', 'Adenylyl cyclase 3/adenylyl cyclase-associated protein 1 (CAP1) complex mediates the anti-migratory effect of forskolin in pancreatic cancer cells.', 'N-cadherin engagement provides a dominant stop signal for the migration of MDA-MB-468 breast carcinoma cells.', 'Roles of the nervous system in pancreatic cancer.', 'Norepinephrine inhibits migration and invasion of human glioblastoma cell cultures possibly via MMP-11 inhibition.', 'α2-Adrenergic Disruption of β Cell BDNF-TrkB Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Signaling.', 'Role of the nervous system in cancer metastasis.', 'Relationship between anti-depressant use and lung cancer survival.']"""

Various studies reported that Ca(2+), cytochrome c, and caspase activation play a role in Salinomycin-induced cytotoxicity. Furthermore, Salinomycin may target Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway to promote differentiation and thus elimination of cancer stem cells. In this study, we show a massive autophagic response to Salinomycin (substantially stronger than to commonly used autophagic inducer Rapamycin) in prostrate-, breast cancer cells, and to lesser degree in human normal dermal fibroblasts. Interestingly, autophagy induced by Salinomycin is a cell protective mechanism in all tested cancer cell lines. Furthermore, Salinomycin induces mitophagy, mitoptosis and increased mitochondrial membrane potential (∆Ψ) in a subpopulation of cells. Salinomycin strongly, and in time-dependent manner decreases cellular ATP level. Contrastingly, human normal dermal fibroblasts treated with Salinomycin show some initial decrease in mitochondrial mass, however they are largely resistant to Salinomycin-triggered ATP-depletion. Our data provide new insight into the molecular mechanism of preferential toxicity of Salinomycin towards cancer cells, and suggest possible clinical application of Salinomycin in combination with autophagy inhibitors (i.e. clinically-used Chloroquine).

Material and methods:   We measured total PSA (PSAt), free PSA (PSAl), complex PSA (PSAc), PSAl% and PSAc% levels in 158 patients. Of these, 98 (62%) were biopsied for presenting PSAt≥3 ng/dl and PSAl%<20, PSAt>10, suspicious rectal examination or suspicious ultrasound node. We performed linear regression and Passing-Bablok regression analyses. The ROC curves were calculated to study the sensitivity and specificity of PSAl% and PSAc% and were compared to each other. The prostate cancer diagnoses were analysed by PSAl% and PSAc% by applying the χ(2) test.  Results:   The correlation coefficient (r) was good (0.7447, P<.0001), and the index of determination (r(2)) was 0,5. The result of the Passing-Bablok analysis was a slope of 1.658 (1.452 to 1.897) and an intersection of 2.044 (-0,936 to 5.393). The optimal cutoff for PSAl% (≤14.7854) showed a sensitivity of 89.29% [95% CI, 0,642-0,823] and a specificity of 54.29% (95% CI, 0,642-0,823). The optimal cutoff for PSAc% (>89.7796) had a sensitivity of 71.43% (95% CI, 0,616-0,802) and a specificity of 71.43% (95% CI, 0,616-0,802). There were no significant differences when comparing the areas under the curve of both markers (P=.59). The PPV of PSAl% was less than that of PSAc% (45.7% vs. 71%).

Since altered cell cycle is a hallmark of human cancers, we investigated androgen regulation of Cdc25C protein in human prostate cancer (PCa) cells, including androgen-sensitive (AS) LNCaP C-33 cells and androgen-independent (AI) LNCaP C-81 as well as PC-3 cells. In the regular culture condition containing fetal bovine serum (FBS), Cdc25C protein levels were similar in these PCa cells. In a steroid-reduced condition, Cdc25C protein was greatly decreased in AS C-33 cells but not AI C-81 or PC-3 cells. In androgen-treated C-33 cells, the Cdc25C protein level was greatly elevated, following a dose- and a time-dependent manner, correlating with increased cell proliferation. This androgen effect was blocked by Casodex, an androgen receptor blocker. Nevertheless, epidermal growth factor (EGF), a growth stimulator of PCa cells, could only increase Cdc25C protein level by about 1.5-fold. Altered expression of Cdc25C in C-33 cells and PC-3 cells by cDNA and/or shRNA transfection is associated with the corresponding changes of cell growth and Cyclin B1 protein level. Actinomycin D and cycloheximide could only partially block androgen-induced Cdc25C protein level. Treatments with both proteasomal and lysosomal inhibitors resulted in elevated Cdc25C protein levels. Immunoprecipitation revealed that androgens reduced the ubiquitination of Cdc25C proteins. These results show for the first time that Cdc25C protein plays a role in regulating PCa cell growth, and androgen treatments, but not EGF, greatly increase Cdc25C protein levels in AS PCa cells, which is in part by decreasing its degradation. These results can lead to advanced PCa therapy via up-regulating the degradation pathways of Cdc25C protein.""","""['Yu-Wei Chou', 'Li Zhang', 'Sakthivel Muniyan', 'Humera Ahmad', 'Satyendra Kumar', 'Syed Mahfuzul Alam', 'Ming-Fong Lin']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Proteasome-mediated degradation of cell division cycle 25C and cyclin-dependent kinase 1 in phenethyl isothiocyanate-induced G2-M-phase cell cycle arrest in PC-3 human prostate cancer cells.', 'Increased acid ceramidase expression depends on upregulation of androgen-dependent deubiquitinases, USP2, in a human prostate cancer cell line, LNCaP.', 'Proteasome mediated degradation of CDC25C and Cyclin B1 in Demethoxycurcumin treated human glioma U87 MG cells to trigger G2/M cell cycle arrest.', 'Androgens stimulate fatty acid synthase in the human prostate cancer cell line LNCaP.', 'Androgen-induced Wnt signaling in preosteoblasts promotes the growth of MDA-PCa-2b human prostate cancer cells.', 'Gene Expression Analysis Reveals Key Genes and Signalings Associated with the Prognosis of Prostate Cancer.', 'Anti-tumor activity of BET inhibitors in androgen-receptor-expressing triple-negative breast cancer.', 'Protein kinase D1 induces G1-phase cell-cycle arrest independent of Checkpoint kinases by phosphorylating Cell Division Cycle Phosphatase 25.', 'Acetyl-macrocalin B, an ent-kaurane diterpenoid, initiates apoptosis through the ROS-p38-caspase 9-dependent pathway and induces G2/M phase arrest via the Chk1/2-Cdc25C-Cdc2/cyclin B axis in non-small cell lung cancer.', 'Differential effect of estradiol and bisphenol A on Set8 and Sirt1 expression in prostate cancer.']"""

Recent work has shown that prostate cancer (PCa) cell lines express the growth-arrest specific 6 (GAS6) receptors Axl, Tyro3, and Mer, and become growth arrested in response to GAS6. We therefore hypothesized that GAS6 signaling regulates the proliferative activity of DTCs in the marrow. To explore this possibility, in vivo studies were performed where it was observed that when Tyro3 expression levels exceed Axl expression, the PCa cells exhibit rapid growth. When when Axl levels predominate, PCa cells remain largely quiescent.

Here, we developed a ""breakpoint analysis"" pipeline to discover candidate gene fusions by tell-tale transcript level or genomic DNA copy number transitions occurring within genes. Mining data from 974 diverse cancer samples, we identified 198 candidate fusions involving annotated cancer genes. From these, we validated and further characterized novel gene fusions involving ROS1 tyrosine kinase in angiosarcoma (CEP85L/ROS1), SLC1A2 glutamate transporter in colon cancer (APIP/SLC1A2), RAF1 kinase in pancreatic cancer (ATG7/RAF1) and anaplastic astrocytoma (BCL6/RAF1), EWSR1 in melanoma (EWSR1/CREM), CDK6 kinase in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (FAM133B/CDK6), and CLTC in breast cancer (CLTC/VMP1). Notably, while these fusions involved known cancer genes, all occurred with novel fusion partners and in previously unreported cancer types. Moreover, several constituted druggable targets (including kinases), with therapeutic implications for their respective malignancies. Lastly, breakpoint analysis identified new cell line models for known rearrangements, including EGFRvIII and FIP1L1/PDGFRA.

This model has attracted considerable interest in recent years due to its implications in the prognosis and clinical management of cancer because CSCs mediate the occurrence, growth, and recurrence of tumors. OCT4 is central to embryonic stem cell self-renewal and differentiation into specific lineages and encodes two chief isoforms that are generated by alternative splicing--OCT4A and OCT4B. Their function in prostate cancer (PCa) is unknown. The prognostic function of OCT4 isoforms in PCa samples was examined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and sensitivity and specificity of the antibodies used were evaluated by molecular biology techniques. Biochemical and pathological data and specimens from 193 patients with PCa were evaluated retrospectively. IHC, western blot, immunofluorescence, and automated image analysis were also performed. IHC was performed on a tissue microarray, and western blot and immunofluorescence were performed using the PCa cell line DU-145. IHC expression of OCT4 isoforms correlated with biochemical and pathological parameters, particularly biochemical recurrence-free survival (BCRFS). Patients with higher levels of OCT4B had lower Gleason scores and decreased likelihood of experiencing biochemical recurrence (BR). OCT4A(+) OCT4B(-) patients had the shortest BCRFS, and positivity for OCT4B expression was an independent prognostic factor for BCRFS in the multivariate analysis. We conclude that the expression of OCT4B is a strong marker of good prognosis, and its presence is associated with a decreased likelihood of BR.

Polyinosine-polycytidylic acid (poly I:C) and polyadenylic-polyuridylic acid (poly A:U) are synthetic analogs of viral dsRNA and strong inducers of type I interferon (IFN). We describe here a novel effect of dsRNA analogs on cancer cells: besides their potential to induce cancer cell apoptosis through an IFN-β autocrine loop, dsRNA-elicited IFN-β production improves dendritic cell (DC) functionality. Human A549 lung and DU145 prostate carcinoma cells significantly responded to poly I:C stimulation, producing IFN-β at levels that were capable of activating STAT1 and enhancing CXCL10, CD40, and CD86 expression on human monocyte-derived DCs. IFN-β produced by poly I:C-activated human cancer cells increased the capacity of monocyte-derived DCs to stimulate IFN-γ production in an allogeneic stimulatory culture in vitro. When melanoma murine B16 cells were stimulated in vitro with poly A:U and then inoculated into TLR3(-/-) mice, smaller tumors were elicited. This tumor growth inhibition was abrogated in IFNAR1(-/-) mice. Thus, dsRNA compounds are effective adjuvants not only because they activate DCs and promote strong adaptive immunity, but also because they can directly act on cancer cells to induce endogenous IFN-β production and contribute to the antitumoral response.""","""['Gerardo Gatti', 'Nicolás Gonzalo Nuñez', 'David Andrés Nocera', 'Lien Dejager', 'Claude Libert', 'Constancio Giraudo', 'Mariana Maccioni']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Eur J Immunol""","""['Immunoadjuvant effects of polyadenylic:polyuridylic acids through TLR3 and TLR7.', 'In vitro-generated viral double-stranded RNA in contrast to polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid induces interferon-alpha in human plasmacytoid dendritic cells.', 'IFNβ produced by TLR4-activated tumor cells is involved in improving the antitumoral immune response.', 'Particulate formulations for the delivery of poly(I:C) as vaccine adjuvant.', 'TLR3: interferon induction by double-stranded RNA including poly(I:C).', 'Toll‑like receptor 3 ligands for breast cancer therapies (Review).', 'Direct and indirect effects of IFN-α2b in malignancy treatment: not only an archer but also an arrow.', 'Roles of Toll-Like Receptor 3 in Human Tumors.', 'The Toll-Like Receptor 3 Agonist Polyriboinosinic Polyribocytidylic Acid Increases the Numbers of NK Cells with Distinct Phenotype in the Liver of B6 Mice.', 'Photodynamic Modulation of Type 1 Interferon Pathway on Melanoma Cells Promotes Dendritic Cell Activation.']"""

Individual tumors show large differences in vascularity, but it is uncertain how these differences affect responsiveness to antiangiogenesis. We investigated this question using two closely related prostate cancer models that differ markedly in tumor vascularity: PC3, which has very low vascularity, and the PC3-derived cancer stem-like cell holoclone PC3/2G7, which forms tumors with high microvessel density, high tumor blood flow, and low hypoxia compared with parental PC3 tumors. Three angiogenesis inhibitors (axitinib, sorafenib, and DC101) all induced significantly greater decreases in tumor blood flow and microvessel density in PC3/2G7 tumors compared with PC3 tumors, as well as significantly greater decreases in tumor cell proliferation and cell viability and a greater increase in apoptosis. The increased sensitivity of PC3/2G7 tumors to antiangiogenesis indicates they are less tolerant of low vascularity and suggests they become addicted to their oxygen- and nutrient-rich environment. PC3/2G7 tumors showed strong upregulation of the proangiogenic factors chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) and VEGFA compared with PC3 tumors, which may contribute to their increased vascularity, and they have significantly lower endothelial cell pericyte coverage, which may contribute to their greater sensitivity to antiangiogenesis. Interestingly, high levels of VEGF receptor-2 were expressed on PC3 but not PC3/2G7 tumor cells, which may contribute to the growth static response of PC3 tumors to VEGF-targeted antiangiogenesis. Finally, prolonged antiangiogenic treatment led to resumption of PC3/2G7 tumor growth and neovascularization, indicating these cancer stem-like cell-derived tumors can adapt and escape from antiangiogenesis.""","""['Kexiong Zhang', 'David J Waxman']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Ther""","""['Nonclinical antiangiogenesis and antitumor activities of axitinib (AG-013736), an oral, potent, and selective inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases 1, 2, 3.', 'CXCR2 Inhibition Combined with Sorafenib Improved Antitumor and Antiangiogenic Response in Preclinical Models of Ovarian Cancer.', 'Differential sensitivity of prostate tumor derived endothelial cells to sorafenib and sunitinib.', 'Possibilities for inhibiting tumor-induced angiogenesis: results with multi-target tyrosine kinase inhibitors.', 'The role of antiangiogenesis therapy: bevacizumab and beyond.', 'Antitumor effect of axitinib combined with dopamine and PK-PD modeling in the treatment of human breast cancer xenograft.', 'Multi-modal characterization of vasculature and nanoparticle accumulation in five tumor xenograft models.', 'Feasibility of spatial frequency domain imaging (SFDI) for optically characterizing a preclinical oncology model.', 'A phase II evaluation of cediranib in the treatment of recurrent or persistent endometrial cancer: An NRG Oncology/Gynecologic Oncology Group study.', 'The osteoblastic and osteoclastic interactions in spinal metastases secondary to prostate cancer.']"""

Methods:   TLDs were combined with endorectal balloons to measure dose at the anterior rectal wall during daily proton treatment delivery. Radiopaque metallic markers were employed as surrogates for balloon position reproducibility in rotation and translation. The markers were utilized to guide the balloon orientation during daily treatment employing orthogonal x-ray image-guided patient positioning. TLDs were placed at the 12 o'clock position on the anterior balloon surface at the midprostatic plane. Markers were placed at the 3 and 9 o'clock positions on the balloon to align it with respect to the planned orientation. The balloon rotation along its stem axis, referred to as roll, causes TLD displacement along the anterior-posterior direction. The magnitude of TLD displacement is revealed by the separation distance between markers at opposite sides of the balloon on sagittal x-ray images.  Results:   A total of 81 in vivo TLD measurements were performed on six patients. Eighty-three percent of all measurements (65 TLD readings) were within +5% and -10% of the planning dose with a mean of -2.1% and a standard deviation of 3.5%. Examination of marker positions with in-room x-ray images of measured doses between -10% and -20% of the planned dose revealed a strong correlation between balloon roll and TLD displacement posteriorly from the planned position.

This approach could properly correct the balloon roll, resulting in TLD positioning within 2 mm along the anterior-posterior direction.

The authors describe a method to construct inhomogeneous fractional dose (IFD) distributions, and evaluate the potential gain in the therapeutic effect from their delivery in proton therapy delivered by pencil beam scanning.  Methods:   For 13 cases of prostate cancer, the authors considered hypofractionated courses of 60 Gy delivered in 20 fractions. (All doses denoted in Gy include the proton's mean relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of 1.1.) Two types of plans were optimized using two opposed lateral beams to deliver a uniform dose of 3 Gy per fraction to the target by scanning: (1) in conventional full-target plans (FTP), each beam irradiated the entire gland, (2) in split-target plans (STP), beams irradiated only the respective proximal hemispheres (prostate split sagittally). Inverse planning yielded intensity maps, in which discrete position control points of the scanned beam (spots) were assigned optimized intensity values. FTP plans preferentially required a higher intensity of spots in the distal part of the target, while STP, by design, employed proximal spots. To evaluate the utility of IFD delivery, IFD plans were generated by rearranging the spot intensities from FTP or STP intensity maps, separately as well as combined using a variety of mixing weights. IFD courses were designed so that, in alternating fractions, one of the hemispheres of the prostate would receive a dose boost and the other receive a lower dose, while the total physical dose from the IFD course was roughly uniform across the prostate. IFD plans were normalized so that the equivalent uniform dose (EUD) of rectum and bladder did not increase, compared to the baseline FTP plan, which irradiated the prostate uniformly in every fraction. An EUD-based model was then applied to estimate tumor control probability (TCP) and normal tissue complication probability (NTCP). To assess potential local RBE variations, LET distributions were calculated with Monte Carlo, and compared for different plans. The results were assessed in terms of their sensitivity to uncertainties in model parameters and delivery.  Results:   IFD courses included equal number of fractions boosting either hemisphere, thus, the combined physical dose was close to uniform throughout the prostate. However, for the entire course, the prostate EUD in IFD was higher than in conventional FTP by up to 14%, corresponding to the estimated increase in TCP to 96% from 88%. The extent of gain depended on the mixing factor, i.e., relative weights used to combine FTP and STP spot weights. Increased weighting of STP typically yielded a higher target EUD, but also led to increased sensitivity of dose to variations in the proton's range. Rectal and bladder EUD were same or lower (per normalization), and the NTCP for both remained below 1%. The LET distributions in IFD also depended strongly on the mixing weights: plans using higher weight of STP spots yielded higher LET, indicating a potentially higher local RBE.  Conclusions:   In proton therapy delivered by pencil beam scanning, improved therapeutic outcome can potentially be expected with delivery of IFD distributions, while administering the prescribed quasi-uniform dose to the target over the entire course. The biological effectiveness of IFD may be further enhanced by optimizing the LET distributions. IFD distributions are characterized by a dose gradient located in proximity of the prostate's midplane, thus, the fidelity of delivery would depend crucially on the precision with which the proton range could be controlled.""","""['Chuan Zeng', 'Drosoula Giantsoudi', 'Clemens Grassberger', 'Saveli Goldberg', 'Andrzej Niemierko', 'Harald Paganetti', 'Jason A Efstathiou', 'Alexei Trofimov']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['SU-E-T-552: Maximizing the Biological Effect of Proton Dose Delivered with Scanned Beam.', 'Inclusion of a variable RBE into proton and photon plan comparison for various fractionation schedules in prostate radiation therapy.', 'Radiobiological and dosimetric impact of RayStation pencil beam and Monte Carlo algorithms on intensity-modulated proton therapy breast cancer plans.', 'Hypofractionated proton therapy for non-small cell lung cancer: Ready for prime time?

We have previously shown that GT-oligo inhibits growth, arrests cell cycle, and induces apoptosis in ovarian, pancreatic, and prostate cancer cells. However, not all ovarian cancer cell lines are susceptible to GT-oligo exposure. GT-oligo was found to induce transcript expression of the tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) receptors DR-4 and DR-5, which are generally silenced in ovarian cancer cells, rendering them insensitive to TRAIL. Exposure of TRAIL- and GT-oligo-resistant cell lines to GT-oligo rendered them sensitive to the cytotoxic effects of TRAIL, producing more than additive inhibition of growth. An intracellular inhibitor of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway, FLICE-like Inhibitory Protein-Short (FLIPs), was down-regulated and Jun kinase (JNK) was activated by exposure to GT-oligo. JNK inhibition partially reversed the growth inhibition caused by the combination of GT-oligo and TRAIL indicating partial involvement of the Jun kinase pathway in the resulting cytotoxic effect. Both capase-8 and caspases 3/7 were activated by exposure to GT-oligo plus TRAIL, consistent with activation of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway.

NDRG1 phosphorylation is associated with inhibition of metastasis and Western blots indicate two bands at ~41 and ~46 kDa. Previous investigations by others suggest the higher band is due to NDRG1 phosphorylation. However, the current study using a dephosphorylation assay and the Phos-tag (phosphate-binding tag) SDS/PAGE assay, demonstrated that the 46 kDa NDRG1 protein band was not due to phosphorylation. Further experiments showed that the NDRG1 protein bands were not affected upon glycosidase treatment, despite marked effects of these enzymes on the glycosylated protein, fetuin. Analysis using RT-PCR (reverse transcriptase-PCR) demonstrated only a single amplicon, and thus, the two bands could not result from an alternatively spliced NDRG1 transcript. Western-blot analysis of prostate cancer cell lysates identified the 41 kDa band to be a truncated form of NDRG1, with MS confirming the full and truncated proteins to be NDRG1. Significantly, this truncated protein was not present in normal human PrECs (prostate epithelial cells). Western-blot analysis using anti-NDRG1 raised to its N-terminal sequence failed to detect the truncated protein, suggesting that it lacked N-terminus amino acids (residues 1-49).

EtBr inserts itself between the stacked bases in double-stranded DNA and specifically inhibits mtDNA transcription and replication by deleting RNA primers required for initiating mtDNA replication. In this study, the authors wanted to examine whether blocking mtDNA replication with EtBr could change the expression of stenmness genes and the expression of the immuneregulator B7-H3 in prostate cancer cell lines in vitro. Both PC-3 and DU145 prostate cancer cell lines were treated with 50 and 500 ng/mL of EtBr for 2 weeks. There was no difference in growth between EtBr-treated and control cells after 1 week. A slightly slower growth was observed for both cell lines during the second week of culture with EtBr compared to controls. After 2 weeks of culture with EtBr both cell lines showed increased expression of the stemness-related genes ABCG2, Oct3/4, Nanog1/Nanogp8, and CD44. Concomitantly, a dose-dependent increase of B7-H3 protein expression in both cell lines was identified and verified by both flow cytometry and immunocytochemistry. In conclusion, blocking mtDNA replication by EtBr induces increased expression of stemness genes, such as Oct3/4, Nanog, CD44, and ABCG2, in addition to the immune regulator B7-H3 in PC-3 and DU145 prostate cancer cell lines. The findings indicate that mitochondrial function may be associated with stemness of cancer cells and/or maintenance of a cancer stem cell phenotype.

Methods:   Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for Jagged-1 and Notch-1 was performed on tissue microarray (TMA) slides containing 286 formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue specimens with various prostatic pathologies, including benign changes, high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN), low- and high-grade PCas as well as metastatic PCa.  Results:   Cytoplasmic and membranous IHC scores for Jagged-1 in both metastatic PCa and high grade PCa were significantly higher than those in low grade PCa and in benign prostatic tissues. Similarly, cytoplasmic IHC scores of Notch-1 in both metastatic PCa and high grade PCa were significantly elevated compared with those observed in low grade PCa and in benign prostatic tissues. A statistically significant correlation was identified between the expression of Jagged-1 and Notch-1 in human prostatic tissues. Furthermore, significantly more highly expressed Jagged-1 in membrane was observed in Caucasian patients with high-grade or metastatic PCa (vs. African Americans) and in PCa patients with positive surgical margins (vs. negative surgical margins).

Consistent with our earlier report, sarcosine levels were significantly elevated in PCa urine sediments compared to controls, with a modest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.71. In addition, the expression of sarcosine biosynthetic enzyme, glycine N-methyltransferase (GNMT), was elevated in PCa tissues, while sarcosine dehydrogenase (SARDH) and pipecolic acid oxidase (PIPOX), which metabolize sarcosine, were reduced in prostate tumors. Consistent with this, GNMT promoted the oncogenic potential of prostate cells by facilitating sarcosine production, while SARDH and PIPOX reduced the oncogenic potential of prostate cells by metabolizing sarcosine. Accordingly, addition of sarcosine, but not glycine or alanine, induced invasion and intravasation in an in vivo PCa model.

Effectiveness and socioeconomic feasibility were evaluated according to quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER ; Δcost per ΔQALY), respectively. As a result, outcomes including cancer detection rates and stage shift suggested that these models well recapitulated actual prostate cancer mass screening. The meta-interval strategy was more cost-effective than the control strategy. The ICER for the control strategy with respect to the meta-interval strategy exceeded US$62, 000/QALY through the sensitivity analyses for every assumption. The meta-interval strategy was more effective and less expensive if the trade-off of impaired clinical outcomes caused by delayed detection was small.

The median EBRT dose was 74 gray (Gy). In univariate analysis, tobacco use and other prognostic factors were compared with disease control and toxicity. Multivariable analysis included tobacco use and the covariates that were associated with outcome on univariate analysis (P < .1).  Results:   The rate of 5-year freedom from biochemical failure (FFBF) was 76% for current smokers, 81% for prior smokers, and 87% for never smokers (P < .02). Risk group, the percentage of involved cores, and EBRT dose ≥74 Gy were associated with FFBF (all P < .01). On multivariable analysis, smoking was not associated with FFBF (P = .19). Factors that were associated with late grade ≥2 genitourinary toxicity on univariate analysis included positive tobacco history, intensity-modulated radiotherapy, and EBRT dose ≥74 Gy (all P < .05). Prior transurethral resection of the prostate (P < .01) and current smoking status (P = .06) were associated with grade ≥3 toxicity. On multivariable analysis, a positive tobacco history was associated with grade ≥2 toxicity (hazard ratio, 1.45; P < .02), and current smoking status was associated with grade ≥3 toxicity (hazard ratio, 3.02; P < .05). Tobacco use was not associated with late gastrointestinal toxicity.

South Africa, like many African countries, has no population-based screening for this disease.  Objective:   The purpose of this study was to develop and pilot test an intervention focused on the prevention and detection of prostate cancer in a resource-poor community in Tshwane, South Africa.  Intervention:   Personal invitations for screening were extended to 122 men 40 years or older. Those presenting for screening received health education on prostate cancer and were screened using digital rectal examination and a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test. Follow-up appointments were also arranged.  Results:   Only 53.3% (n = 65) of the invitees reported for screening, with 38 (58.5%) returning to the clinic to learn the results of the PSA test. Knowledge of prostate cancer improved significantly after the intervention. Abnormal findings were detected in 6.2% (n = 4) of the participants, and elevations in PSA levels, in 12.3% (n = 8).  Conclusions:   Disappointing results in terms of screening uptake and the number of men lost to follow-up were achieved. The strategies to improve knowledge were successful and resulted in a significant increase in knowledge of prostate cancer.  Implications for nursing practice:   The success of a cancer prevention and detection service is determined by participation and screening uptake. The reasons for not accepting the screening invitation and not returning to learn the findings of the PSA test should be explored.

The impact of two chemokine receptor gene polymorphisms, CCR2-64I (rs1799864) and CCR5-Δ32 (rs333), was evaluated in BPH and PCa. 385 DNA samples (130 BPH, 136 PCa, 119 healthy control) were genotyped. The allele frequencies were similar among control, BPH and PCa groups. Median of serum PSA levels was different between groups: 0.79, 1.45 and 6.91 ng/mL in control, BPH and PCa groups, respectively (all p<0.001). The prostate volume median was 20.00 cm(3) in the control group, thus, lower than BPH (35.35 cm(3)) and PCa (35.80 cm(3)) (both p<0.001), nevertheless no statistical significant difference was observed between BPH and PCa patients (p=0.172). Remarkably, CCR2-64I was a protective factor to PCa when compared with BPH (OR=0.550; 95%CI=0.311-0.975), although the statistically significant difference was lost after correction for multiple comparisons.

Methods:   CT scans of two prostate cancer patients ('benchmarking cases'), one high risk (HR) and one intermediate risk (IR), were sent to multiple radiotherapy centres for segmentation of prostate, rectum and bladder structures according to the TROG 03.04 ""RADAR"" trial protocol definitions. The same structures were automatically segmented using iPlan software for the same two patients, allowing structures defined by automatic segmentation to be quantitatively compared with those defined by multiple observers. A sample of twenty trial patient datasets were also used to automatically generate anatomical structures for quantitative comparison with structures defined by individual observers for the same datasets.  Results:   There was considerable agreement amongst all observers and automatic segmentation of the benchmarking cases for bladder (mean spatial variations < 0.4 cm across the majority of image slices). Although there was some variation in interpretation of the superior-inferior (cranio-caudal) extent of rectum, human-observer contours were typically within a mean 0.6 cm of automatically-defined contours. Prostate structures were more consistent for the HR case than the IR case with all human observers segmenting a prostate with considerably more volume (mean +113.3%) than that automatically segmented. Similar results were seen across the twenty sample datasets, with disagreement between iPlan and observers dominant at the prostatic apex and superior part of the rectum, which is consistent with observations made during quality assurance reviews during the trial.  Conclusions:   This study has demonstrated quantitative analysis for comparison of multi-observer segmentation studies. For automatic segmentation algorithms based on image-registration as in iPlan, it is apparent that agreement between observer and automatic segmentation will be a function of patient-specific image characteristics, particularly for anatomy with poor contrast definition. For this reason, it is suggested that automatic registration based on transformation of a single reference dataset adds a significant systematic bias to the resulting volumes and their use in the context of a multicentre trial should be carefully considered.""","""['John P Geraghty', 'Garry Grogan', 'Martin A Ebert']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Radiat Oncol""","""['A qualitative and a quantitative analysis of an auto-segmentation module for prostate cancer.', 'Automatic segmentation of thoracic and pelvic CT images for radiotherapy planning using implicit anatomic knowledge and organ-specific segmentation strategies.', 'Multi-observer contouring of male pelvic anatomy: Highly variable agreement across conventional and emerging structures of interest.', 'Investigation and benchmarking of U-Nets on prostate segmentation tasks.', 'Automatic Segmentation of Pelvic Cancers Using Deep Learning: State-of-the-Art Approaches and Challenges.', 'Methodological approach to create an atlas using a commercial auto-contouring software.', 'A Deep Learning-Based Automated CT Segmentation of Prostate Cancer Anatomy for Radiation Therapy Planning-A Retrospective Multicenter Study.', 'Synthetic MRI-aided multi-organ segmentation on male pelvic CT using cycle consistent deep attention network.', 'Autosegmentation of the rectum on megavoltage image guidance scans.', 'Registering prostate external beam radiotherapy with a boost from high-dose-rate brachytherapy: a comparative evaluation of deformable registration algorithms.']"""

Advantages over morphine sulphate and its alternatives include low cost, lack of active metabolites and efficacy against neuropathic pain.  Objectives:   To describe our experience with opioid rotation to methadone and compare the morphine to methadone ratios to previously published data; To discuss two commonly used rotation methods--the Edmonton and Morley-Makin methods.  Method:   We describe two cases with cancer pain successfully switched to methadone. In both cases the dose of the previous opioid was limited by development of opioid toxicity. We used the Morley-Makin conversion method and modified it by reducing the 'as required' dose by a third. The initial methadone doses for these cases were lower than predicted doses.  Conclusion:   In cases where cancer patients fail to respond or develop tolerance to opioids, conversion to methadone is a reasonable approach. Although equianalgesic tables may not always predict final methadone doses, when properly selected can be useful tools for the experienced clinician.

The common all-causality adverse events (all grades) in Japanese patients were dysphonia (68%), hypertension (64%), hand-foot syndrome (64%) and diarrhea (56%) for axitinib, and hand-foot syndrome (86%), hypertension (62%) and diarrhea (52%) for sorafenib. The safety profiles of axitinib and sorafenib in Japanese patients were generally similar to those observed in the overall population, with the exceptions of higher incidences of hypertension, dysphonia, hand-foot syndrome, hypothyroidism and stomatitis.

We have previously reported that a ""Western"" diet promotes PCa tumor growth in vivo. Presently, we report the effects of sustained aerobic exercise on PCa progression in animals fed a high-fat diet versus a standard diet.  Methods:   Athymic mice (n = 43) were inoculated subcutaneously with human PCa (LNCaP) cells, fed ad libitum with either a high-fat or a standard diet, and randomized into forced exercising and non-exercising groups. Body weight, tumor volume, and food consumption were recorded tri-weekly. Terminal serum samples and tumor biopsies were obtained for analysis.  Results:   Body weight differences were not observed between the groups over time. The high-fat diet with exercise (HF-Ex) group showed significantly increased tumor growth rate compared to all other groups (P < 0.0007). Tumor growth rate of the standard diet with exercise (Std-Ex) group was reduced significantly compared to the high-fat diet without exercise (HF-No Ex) group (P = 0.0008). Significant differences (P ≤ 0.012) were observed in energy consumption (kcal) between the groups over time. Exercising mice consumed significantly more kcal than non-exercising mice, and the HF-Ex group consumed significantly more than each of the other three groups (P < 0.0007). The expression levels of p27 and p21 were increased in exercising animals, while AR expression was elevated in the HF-Ex group versus the Std-Ex and HF-No Ex groups.  Conclusions:   Sustained aerobic exercise did not counteract the tumor-promotional effect of increased consumption of a high-fat diet, suggesting that diet is more influential in PCa progression than exercise. Combining exercise with a healthy diet reduced the rate of PCa progression in this model. This study may have implications for PCa risk reduction in humans.""","""['Avi D Vandersluis', 'Natalie A Venier', 'Alexandra J Colquhoun', 'Linda Sugar', 'Michael Pollak', 'Alex Kiss', 'Neil E Fleshner', 'Laurence H Klotz', 'Vasundara Venkateswaran']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Association of diet-induced hyperinsulinemia with accelerated growth of prostate cancer (LNCaP) xenografts.', 'Vitamin E inhibits the high-fat diet promoted growth of established human prostate LNCaP tumors in nude mice.', 'Effects of an ad libitum low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet on body weight, body composition, and fat distribution in older men and women: a randomized controlled trial.', 'Preclinical models relevant to diet, exercise, and cancer risk.', 'Mobilizing serum factors and immune cells through exercise to counteract age-related changes in cancer risk.', 'Targeting lipid metabolism in metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Impacts of exercise interventions on different diseases and organ functions in mice.', 'Research Evidence on High-Fat Diet-Induced Prostate Cancer Development and Progression.', 'Relationship Between Aerobic Fitness, the Serum IGF-1 Profiles of Healthy Young Adult African American Males, and Growth of Prostate Cancer Cells.']"""

Two variants, W106F- and K75A-cystatin C, showed that the internalization can be positively affected by engineering of the cystatin molecule. Microscopy revealed vesicular co-localization of internalized cystatin C with the lysosomal marker proteins cathepsin D and legumain. Activities of both cysteine cathepsins and legumain, possible target enzymes associated with cancer cell invasion and metastasis, were down-regulated in cell homogenates following cystatin C uptake. A positive effect on regulation of intracellular enzyme activity by a cystatin variant selected from uptake properties was illustrated by incubating cells with W106F-cystatin C. This resulted in more efficient down-regulation of intracellular legumain activity than when cells were incubated with wild-type cystatin C. Uptake experiments in prostate cancer cells corroborated that the cystatin C internalization is generally relevant and confirmed an increased uptake of W106F-cystatin C, in PC3 cells.

Recently, we demonstrated the growth-inhibitory and apoptosis-inducing properties of polyphenol-rich sweet potato greens extract (SPGE) in cell culture and in vivo prostate cancer xenograft models. However, the bioactive constituents remain elusive. Here, we report a bioactivity-guided fractionation of SPGE based upon differential solvent polarity using chromatographic techniques that led to the identification of a remarkably active polyphenol-enriched fraction, F5, which was ~100-fold more potent than the parent extract as shown by IC50 measurements in human prostate cancer cells. High-performance liquid chromatography-ultraviolet and mass spectrometric analyses of the seven SPGE fractions suggested varying abundance of the major phenols, quinic acid (QA), caffeic acid, its ester chlorogenic acid, and isochlorogenic acids, 4,5-di-CQA, 3,5-di-CQA and 3,4-di-CQA, with a distinct composition of the most active fraction, F5. Subfractionation of F5 resulted in loss of bioactivity, suggesting synergistic interactions among the constituent phytochemicals. Quantitative analyses revealed a ~2.6- and ~3.6-fold enrichment of QA and chlorogenic acid, respectively, in F5 and a definitive ratiometric relationship between the isochlorogenic acids. Daily oral administration of 400mg/kg body wt of F5 inhibited growth and progression of prostate tumor xenografts by ~75% in nude mice, as evidenced by tumor volume measurements and non-invasive real-time bioluminescence imaging.

In this novel interstitial CDF-DOT method, absolute light fluence per source strength (in unit of 1 cm(-2)) is used to separate absorption and scattering coefficients. A mathematical phantom and a solid prostate phantom including anomalies with known optical properties were used, respectively, to test the feasibility of reconstructing optical properties using interstitial CDF-DOT. Three dimension spatial distributions of the optical properties were reconstructed for both scenarios. Our studies show that absorption coefficient can be reliably extrapolated while there are some cross talks between absorption and scattering properties.

This data set features subjects divided into two groups (early versus advanced cancer), with one manifest variable (PSA), one covariate (Gleason score), and one stratification variable (hospital, taking three values). We present a nonparametric method for estimating a shift in median PSA score between the two groups, after adjusting for differences in Gleason score and stratifying on hospital. This method can also be extended to cases involving multivariate manifest variable.  Materials and methods:   Our method uses estimating equations derived from an existing rank-based estimator of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). This existing AUC estimator is adjusted for stratification and for covariates. We use the adjusted AUC estimator to construct a family of tests by shifting manifest variables in one of the treatment groups by an arbitrary constant. The null hypothesis for these tests is that the AUC is half. We report the set of shift values for which the null hypothesis is not rejected as the resulting confidence region.  Results:   Simulated data show performance consistent with the distributional approximations used by the proposed methodology. This methodology is applied to two examples. In the first example, the mean difference in PSA levels between advanced and nonadvanced prostate cancer patients is estimated, controlling for Gleason score. In the second example, to assess the degree to which age and baseline tumor size are prognostic factors for breast cancer recurrence, differences in age and tumor size between subjects with recurrent and nonrecurrent breast cancer, stratified on Tamoxifen treatment and adjusting for tumor grade, are estimated.

Methods and materials:   In the period 1997 to 2007, 483 patients with prostate carcinoma in stage T1-3 N0 (pN0) M0 were treated with definitive RT. Two groups of patients were defined for the analysis: the 3D-CRT group (n=305 patients) and the IMRT group (n=178 patients). In the entire cohort of 483 patients, the median follow-up time reached 4.4 years (range, 2.0-11.7 years). The cumulative absolute and relative volumes of irradiated rectum exposed to a given dose (area under the dose-volume curve, AUC) were estimated. The receiver operating characteristic analysis was then used to search for the optimal dose and volume cutoff points with the potential to distinguish patients with enhanced or escalated toxicity.  Results:   Despite the application of high doses (78-82 Gy) in the IMRT group, GI toxicity was lower in that group than in the group treated by 3D-CRT with prescribed doses of 70 to 74 Gy. Both RT methods showed specific rectal dose-volume distribution curves. The total AUC values for IMRT were significantly lower than those for 3D-CRT. Furthermore, IMRT significantly decreased the rectal volume receiving low to intermediate radiation doses in comparison with 3D-CRT; specific cutoff limits predictable for the level of GI toxicity are presented and defined in our work.  Conclusions:   Total area under the dose-volume profiles and specific cutoff points in low and intermediate dose levels have significant predictive potential toward the RT GI toxicity.

Method:   From 1988 to 2010, data pre- (age, clinical stage, preoperative PSA, biopsy Gleason score) and postoperative (prostate weight, pathologic stage TNM 2010, Gleason score, margin status) of 2765 total prostatectomies were collected prospectively. These data were compared according to existence or absence of tumor at the apex. The prognostic impact of tumor at the apex on biochemical recurrence-free survival (PSA>0.2 ng/mL) has been studied in univariate and multivariate models.  Results:   One thousand eight hundred seventeen tumors had a location at the apex (65.7%). In univariate analysis, there was a significant difference in the clinical stage, the biopsy and pathological Gleason score, the result of curage, the pathological stage and the margin status between apical tumors and others. With a mean decline of 34.6 months, 502 patients had a biochemical recurrence (18.1%). Disease-free survival at 10 years was 60.7% for tumor at the apex versus 65.9% in other cases. The location at the apex was significantly associated with biochemical recurrence on univariate analysis (P=0.01). After adjustment for clinical and pathological stage, PSA level, Gleason score and surgical margins, the apex was not anymore a pejorative independent predictor (P=0.0087).  Conclusion:   The existence of tumor in the prostatic apex was associated with more aggressive tumoral criteria and was an independent and pejorative predictor of biochemical recurrence-free survival at 10 years in univariate analysis.

The aim of this study was to test the feasibility of ngTMA for the investigation of biomarkers within the tumor microenvironment (tumor center and invasion front) of six tumor types, using CD3, CD8 and CD45RO as an example.  Methods:   Ten cases each of malignant melanoma, lung, breast, gastric, prostate and colorectal cancers were reviewed. The most representative H&E slide was scanned and uploaded onto a digital slide management platform. Slides were viewed and seven TMA annotations of 1 mm in diameter were placed directly onto the digital slide. Different colors were used to identify the exact regions in normal tissue (n=1), tumor center (n=2), tumor front (n=2), and tumor microenvironment at invasion front (n=2) for subsequent punching. Donor blocks were loaded into an automated tissue microarrayer. Images of the donor block were superimposed with annotated digital slides. Exact annotated regions were punched out of each donor block and transferred into a TMA block. 420 tissue cores created two ngTMA blocks. H&E staining and immunohistochemistry for CD3, CD8 and CD45RO were performed.  Results:   All 60 slides were scanned automatically (total time<10 hours), uploaded and viewed. Annotation time was 1 hour. The 60 donor blocks were loaded into the tissue microarrayer, simultaneously. Alignment of donor block images and digital slides was possible in less than 2 minutes/case. Automated punching of tissue cores and transfer took 12 seconds/core. Total ngTMA construction time was 1.4 hours. Stains for H&E and CD3, CD8 and CD45RO highlighted the precision with which ngTMA could capture regions of tumor-stroma interaction of each cancer and the T-lymphocytic immune reaction within the tumor microenvironment.  Conclusion:   Based on a manual selection criteria, ngTMA is able to precisely capture histological zones or cell types of interest in a precise and accurate way, aiding the pathological study of the tumor microenvironment. This approach would be advantageous for visualizing proteins, DNA, mRNA and microRNAs in specific cell types using in situ hybridization techniques.""","""['Inti Zlobec', 'Viktor H Koelzer', 'Heather Dawson', 'Aurel Perren', 'Alessandro Lugli']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Transl Med""","""['A next-generation tissue microarray (ngTMA) protocol for biomarker studies.', 'Prognostic value of immunoscore to identify mortality outcomes in adults with HBV-related primary hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'In situ localization of tumor cells associated with the epithelial-mesenchymal transition marker Snail and the prognostic impact of lymphocytes in the tumor microenvironment in invasive ductal breast cancer.', 'Practical methods for tissue microarray construction.', 'Tumour-infiltrating T-cell subsets, molecular changes in colorectal cancer, and prognosis: cohort study and literature review.', 'Programmed Death-Ligand 1 Expression in Lung Cancer and Paired Brain Metastases-a Single-Center Study in 190 Patients.', 'High-throughput proteomics: a methodological mini-review.', 'Interspatial Distribution of Tumor and Immune Cells in Correlation with PD-L1 in Molecular Subtypes of Gastric Cancers.', 'Integrated functional and spatial profiling of tumour immune responses induced by immunotherapy: the iPROFILER platform.', ""Co-Expression of Nogo-A in Dopaminergic Neurons of the Human Substantia Nigra Pars Compacta Is Reduced in Parkinson's Disease.""]"""

It is most variable in GS 7 PC.  Objective:   To determine clinicopathologic features associated with GS 7 PC with LN(+) compared with a control group without lymph node metastases (LN(-)).  Design:   We analyzed 184 GS 7 radical prostatectomies with LN(+) and the same number of LN(-) Gleason-matched controls. The LN(+) cases were GS 3 + 4 = 7 (n = 64; 34.8%), GS 4 + 3 = 7 (n = 66; 35.9%), GS 3 + 4 = 7 with tertiary 5 (n = 10; 5.4%), and GS 4 + 3 = 7 with tertiary 5 (n = 44; 23.9%).  Results:   The LN(+) cases demonstrated higher average values in preoperative prostate-specific antigen (12.2 versus 8.1 ng/mL), percentage of positive biopsy cores (59.1% versus 42.9%), prostate weight (54.4 versus 49.4 g), number of LNs submitted (12.7 versus 9.4), incidence of nonfocal extraprostatic extension (82.6% versus 63.6%), tumor volume (28.9% versus 14.8%), frequency of lymphovascular invasion (78.3% versus 38.6%), intraductal spread of carcinoma (42.4% versus 20.7%), incidence of satellite tumor foci (16.4% versus 4.3%), incidence of pT3b disease (49.5% versus 14.7%), and lymphovascular invasion in the seminal vesicles (52% versus 30%).

Results:   8-CPT-2Me-cAMP treatment caused a 2-2.5-fold increase of p-cPLA2(S505), COX-2, and PGE2 levels in human prostate cancer cell lines. Pretreatment of cells with the COX-2 inhibitor SC-58125 or the EP4 antagonist AH-23848, or with an inhibitor of mTORC1 and mTORC2, Torin1, significantly reduced the Epac1-dependent increase of p-cPLA2 and COX-2, p-S6-kinase(T389), and p-AKT(S473).

Unfortunately, within 10 years following surgery, 30% of patients experience local or distant relapse. Few data exist on the association of markers of angiogenesis and distant relapse after radical prostatectomy. By immunohistochemistry in tissue microarray, we compared the expression pattern of hypoxia inducible factor 1, alpha subunit (HIF1α) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptors in 45 patients with distant relapse and 68 patients without relapse after radical prostatectomy. Expressions of HIF1α and VEGF were assessed in prostate tumor cells and those of VEGFR1, VEGFR2 and neuropilin 1 in tumor and endothelial cells. The five molecules studied were expressed by all tumors, with the exception of neuropilin 1 in endothelial cells for one tumor. Strong endothelial expression of VEGFR1 appeared to be an independent predictor of distant relapse. A moderate to strong endothelial expression of neuropilin 1 was in turn an independent predictor of absence of distant relapse. No significant difference was found for HIF1α, VEGF, VEGFR1, VEGFR2 and neuropilin 1 expression in tumor cells, nor for VEGFR2 in endothelial cells, between the two groups. To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the prognostic value of VEGFR1, VEGFR2 and neuropilin 1 in endothelial cells in prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy. The evaluation by immunohistochemistry of endothelial expression of neuropilin 1 and VEGFR1 could be an additional tool in the assessment of tumor aggressiveness of clinically localized prostate cancer to better identify patients at high risk of distant relapse.""","""['Matthieu Talagas', 'Arnaud Uguen', 'Ronan Garlantezec', 'Georges Fournier', 'Laurent Doucet', 'Eric Gobin', 'Pascale Marcorelles', 'Alain Volant', 'Marc DE Braekeleer']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Anticancer Res""","""['Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 expression in pelvic lymph nodes predicts the risk of cancer progression after radical prostatectomy.', 'The prognostic value of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A and its receptor in clinically localized prostate cancer: a prospective evaluation in 100 patients undergoing radical prostatectomy.', 'Stromal cell-derived factor-1 and vascular endothelial growth factor as biomarkers for lymph node metastasis and poor cancer-specific survival in prostate cancer patients after radical prostatectomy.', 'Neuropilin-1 enforces extracellular matrix signalling via ABL1 to promote angiogenesis.', 'Decreased expression of lysophosphatidylcholine (16:0/OH) in high resolution imaging mass spectrometry independently predicts biochemical recurrence after surgical treatment for prostate cancer.', 'NRP1 promotes prostate cancer progression via modulating EGFR-dependent AKT pathway activation.', 'Deep Learning-Based Multi-Omics Integration Robustly Predicts Relapse in Prostate Cancer.', 'SEMAPHORINS and their receptors: focus on the crosstalk between melanoma and hypoxia.', 'Contrast-enhanced transrectal ultrasound can reduce collection of unnecessary biopsies when diagnosing prostate cancer and is predictive of biochemical recurrence following a radical prostatectomy in patients with localized prostate cancer.', 'Trends in Gene Expression Profiling for Prostate Cancer Risk Assessment: A Systematic Review.']"""

However, its role in urothelial tumours remains unknown. In the present study, we examined the role of BMP10 in urothelial cancer cells and the expression of BMP10 in human urethelial cancer of the bladder.  Materials and methods:   The expression of BMP10 was examined in human bladder tissues and in the T24 human bladder cancer cell line using immunochemical staining and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), respectively. The biological impact of modifying BMP10 expression, through genetic manipulation, in urothelial cancer cells was evaluated using in vitro models.  Results:   mRNA for BMP10 and receptors of BMPs was expressed in T24 cell lines. BMP10 protein expression was observed in normal urothelial and stromal cells, but was found to be decreased in or absent from urothelial cancer cells. The frequency of positive staining in normal tissues (9/9) was significantly higher than that in urothelial cancer tissues (6/15) (p=0.007). T24 cells were transfected with BMP10 expression plasmid. It was further demonstrated that overexpression of BMP10 reduced the growth rate of T24 cells, and markedly reduced the motility, and adhesion of T24 cells in vitro. No significant effects were seen on in vitro invasiveness of T24 cells following BMP10 transfection.  Conclusion:   Expression of BMP10 protein is reduced in cancer cells of bladder tumours. Overexpression of BMP10 has an inhibitory effect on the growth, adhesion, and migration of bladder cancer cells in vitro.

Such image registration is time-consuming while its real-time implementation is yet to be developed. To bypass this registration step, robotic needle biopsy systems can be used to place the US probe at the same position relative to the prostate during the 3D and 2D image acquisition to ensure similar prostate deformation. To have such similar deformation, only visual feedback is not sufficient as such feedback can be used to only guarantee that the whole prostate is within the field of view irrespective of the probe's orientation. As such, contact pressure feedback can be utilized to ensure consistent minimum contact between the probe and prostate.  Method:   A robotic system is proposed where a TRUS probe with pressure sensor array is used. The contact pressure can be measured during imaging and used to provide feedback in conjunction with an optimization algorithm for consistent probe positioning. The robotic system is driven by the feedback to position the probe such that pressure pattern of the sensors during 2D image acquisition is similar to the pressure pattern during 3D image acquisition. The proposed method takes into account the patient's body movement expected during image acquisition. In this study, an in silico phantom is used where the simulated contact pressure distribution required in the optimization algorithm is obtained using a prostate finite element model.  Result:   Starting from an arbitrary position where the probe contacts the phantom, this position was varied systematically until a position corresponding to maximum pressure pattern similarity between contact pressure patterns corresponding to the 2D and 3D imaging was achieved successfully.  Conclusion:   Results obtained from the in silico phantom study indicate that the proposed technique is capable of ensuring having only minimal relative prostate deformation between preoperative image acquisition and intraoperative imaging used for guiding needle biopsy, paving the way for faster and more accurate registration.""","""['Seyed Reza Mousavi', 'Kaamran Raahemifar', 'Stephen Pautler', 'Abbas Samani']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Int J Comput Assist Radiol Surg""","""['Real-time registration of 3D to 2D ultrasound images for image-guided prostate biopsy.', 'Assessment of image registration accuracy in three-dimensional transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy.', 'Technique for a hybrid system of real-time transrectal ultrasound with preoperative magnetic resonance imaging in the guidance of targeted prostate biopsy.', 'TRUS-MRI image registration: a paradigm shift in the diagnosis of significant prostate cancer.', 'Magnetic resonance imaging-transrectal ultrasound fusion image-guided prostate biopsy: Current status of the cancer detection and the prospects of tailor-made medicine of the prostate cancer.']"""

Although efficient therapy is available for early-stage PCa, treatment of advanced disease is mainly ineffective and remains a clinical challenge. microRNA (miRNA) dysregulation is associated with PCa development and progression. In fact, several studies have reported a widespread downregulation of miRNAs in PCa, which highlights the importance of studying compounds capable of restoring the global miRNA expression. The main aim of this study was to define the usefulness of enoxacin as an anti-tumoral agent in PCa, due to its ability to induce miRNA biogenesis in a TRBP-mediated manner. Using a panel of five PCa cell lines, we observed that all of them were wild type for the TARBP2 gene and expressed TRBP protein. Furthermore, primary prostate carcinomas displayed normal levels of TRBP protein.

The loss of p53 function is the main genetic alteration related to the development of high-grade muscle-invasive disease. Prima-1 is a small molecule that restores tumor suppressor function to mutant p53 and induces cancer cell death in various cancer types. Our aim was to investigate the ability of Prima-1 to induce apoptosis after DNA damage in bladder cancer cell lines.  Method:   The therapeutic effect of Prima-1 was studied in two bladder cancer cell lines: T24, which is characterized by a p53 mutation, and RT4, which is the wild-type for the p53 gene. Morphological features of apoptosis induced by p53, including mitochondrial membrane potential changes and the expression of thirteen genes involved in apoptosis, were assessed by microscopic observation and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR).  Results:   Prima-1 was able to reactivate p53 function in the T24 (p53 mt) bladder cancer cell line and promote apoptosis via the induction of Bax and Puma expression, activation of the caspase cascade and disruption of the mitochondrial membrane in a BAK-independent manner.  Conclusion:   Prima-1 is able to restore the transcriptional activity of p53. Experimental studies in vivo may be conducted to test this molecule as a new therapeutic agent for urothelial carcinomas of the bladder, which characteristically harbor p53 mutations.""","""['Camila B Piantino', 'Sabrina T Reis', 'Nayara I Viana', 'Iran A Silva', 'Denis R Morais', 'Alberto A Antunes', 'Nelson Dip', 'Miguel Srougi', 'Katia R Leite']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Clinics (Sao Paulo)""","""['Thymidylate synthase inhibition induces p53-dependent and p53-independent apoptotic responses in human urinary bladder cancer cells.', 'PRIMA-1 induces apoptosis by inhibiting JNK signaling but promoting the activation of Bax.', 'Radiation induces p53-dependent cell apoptosis in bladder cancer cells with wild-type- p53 but not in p53-mutated bladder cancer cells.', 'The p53 tumor suppressor gene and nuclear protein: basic science review and relevance in the management of bladder cancer.', 'TP53 in urologic tumors.', 'The Effect of Arbutin on The Expression of Tumor Suppressor P53, BAX/BCL-2 Ratio and Oxidative Stress Induced by Tert-Butyl Hydroperoxide in Fibroblast and LNcap Cell Lines.', 'p53 reactivation with induction of massive apoptosis-1 (PRIMA-1) inhibits amyloid aggregation of mutant p53 in cancer cells.', 'PRIMA-1 and PRIMA-1Met (APR-246): From Mutant/Wild Type p53 Reactivation to Unexpected Mechanisms Underlying Their Potent Anti-Tumor Effect in Combinatorial Therapies.', 'Mutant p53 Protein and the Hippo Transducers YAP and TAZ: A Critical Oncogenic Node in Human Cancers.', 'Molecular targets in urothelial cancer: detection, treatment, and animal models of bladder cancer.']"""

A novel anti-androgen enzalutamide that inhibits androgen receptor (AR) nuclear translocation has also been developed and tested in the clinic. AR coactivators exert specific cellular regulatory functions, however it is difficult to improve the treatment because of a large number of coregulators overexpressed in prostate cancer. AR itself is a target of several miRNAs which may cause its increased degradation, inhibition of proliferation, and increased apoptosis. Truncated AR occur in prostate cancer as a consequence of alternative splicing. They exhibit ligand-independent transcriptional activity.

Morphological changes of apoptotic body formation after juglone treatment were observed by Hoechst 33342 staining. This apoptotic induction was associated with loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, and caspase-3, -9 activation. Moreover, we found that juglone significantly inhibited the expression levels of androgen receptor (AR) and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in a dose-dependent manner, as well as abrogated up-regulation of AR and PSA genes with and/or without dihydrotestosterone (DHT).

Materials and methods:   In a prospectively collected institutional database, we identified 7,486 subjects eligible for active surveillance who underwent radical retropubic prostatectomy. Candidates were designated as being at low risk (stage T1c/T2a, prostate specific antigen 10 ng/ml or less, and Gleason score 6 or less) or very low risk (stage T1c, prostate specific antigen density 0.15 or less, Gleason score 6 or less, 2 or fewer positive biopsy cores, 50% or less cancer involvement per core) based on preoperative data. Adverse findings were Gleason score upgrade (score 7 or greater) and nonorgan confined cancer on surgical pathology. The relative risk of adverse findings in men at low risk with very low risk disease was evaluated in a multivariate model using Poisson regression.  Results:   A total of 7,333 subjects met the criteria for low risk disease and 153 had very low risk disease. The proportion of subjects at low risk found to have Gleason score upgrade or nonorgan confined cancer on final pathology was 21.8% and 23.1%, respectively.

Materials and methods:   We reviewed the charts of patients treated with radical prostatectomy between 1998 and 2011 at a total of 14 centers. Study inclusion criteria were radical prostatectomy for presumed localized prostate cancer, absent positive nodes and detectable prostate specific antigen, defined as prostate specific antigen 0.1 ng/ml or greater 6 weeks postoperatively. Of the 9,735 radical prostatectomy cases reviewed 496 (5.1%) were eligible for analysis. Predictive factors for oncologic outcomes were assessed in time dependent analyses using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression models.  Results:   At 6 weeks prostate specific antigen was 0.1 to 6.8 ng/ml. Biochemical progression was noted in 74.4% of patients and clinical metastasis was noted in 5%. The 2 most powerful predictors of general salvage treatment (vs radiotherapy) were postoperative prostate specific antigen greater than 1 ng/ml (OR 3.46, p=0.032) and prostate specific antigen velocity greater than 0.2 ng/ml per year (HR 6.01, p=0.001). Positive prostate specific antigen velocity was the single factor that independently correlated with the risk of failed salvage therapy (HR 2.6, p=0.001).

Unrepaired DSBs are thought to be one origin of micronuclei (MN), an indicator of genotoxic stress and chromosomal instability. Studies have detected γH2AX in IR-induced MN, indicating the presence of DSB in MN. Previously we reported that TGFβ downstream proteins Smad7 and phospho-Smad2 (pSmad2) co-localized with DDR proteins following radiation. Here we studied the status of Smad7 and pSmad2 in MN post high linear energy transfer (LET) radiation in human normal and cancerous cells. We observed γH2AX foci in IR-induced MN, whereas 53BP1 and ATF2 were absent. Interestingly, Smad7 foci, but not pSmad2, were detectable in both spontaneous and IR-induced MN. We compared the effect of particle track structures on the yield of MN using 5.6MeV/u boron (B) and 600MeV/u iron (Fe) particles with similar LET (200 and 180keV/μm, respectively) in human fibroblasts. The frequency of MN induced by B was lower than that by Fe particles, albeit the proportion of Smad7-positive to Smad7-negative MN remained constant. An increased frequency of spontaneous MN, with slightly higher ratio of Smad7 or γH2AX positive, was found in human prostate cancer cells (PC3) compared to normal cells. 24h after 1Gy of Fe particles exposure, the yield of MN increased, and the majority (∼70%) carried γH2AX and Smad7.

Unfortunately, quantitative tumor resection is often limited by a surgeon's ability to locate all malignant disease and distinguish it from healthy tissue. Fluorescence-guided surgery has emerged as a tool to aid surgeons in the identification and removal of malignant lesions. While nontargeted fluorescent dyes have been shown to passively accumulate in some tumors, the resulting tumor-to-background ratios are often poor, and the boundaries between malignant and healthy tissues can be difficult to define. To circumvent these problems, our laboratory has developed high affinity tumor targeting ligands that bind to receptors that are overexpressed on cancer cells and deliver attached molecules selectively into these cells. In this study, we explore the use of two tumor-specific targeting ligands (i.e., folic acid that targets the folate receptor (FR) and DUPA that targets prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA)) to deliver near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent dyes specifically to FR and PSMA expressing cancers, thereby rendering only the malignant cells highly fluorescent. We report here that all FR- and PSMA-targeted NIR probes examined bind cultured cancer cells in the low nanomolar range. Moreover, upon intravenous injection into tumor-bearing mice with metastatic disease, these same ligand-NIR dye conjugates render receptor-expressing tumor tissues fluorescent, enabling their facile resection with minimal contamination from healthy tissues.""","""['Lindsay E Kelderhouse', 'Venkatesh Chelvam', 'Charity Wayua', 'Sakkarapalayam Mahalingam', 'Scott Poh', 'Sumith A Kularatne', 'Philip S Low']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Bioconjug Chem""","""['Evaluation of a cholecystokinin 2 receptor-targeted near-infrared dye for fluorescence-guided surgery of cancer.', 'Evaluation of Novel Tumor-Targeted Near-Infrared Probe for Fluorescence-Guided Surgery of Cancer.', 'Enhanced tumor detection using a folate receptor-targeted near-infrared fluorochrome conjugate.', 'A review of NIR dyes in cancer targeting and imaging.', 'Tumor detection using folate receptor-targeted imaging agents.', 'Use of folic acid nanosensors with excellent photostability for hybrid imaging.', 'Targeted Dual-Modal PET/SPECT-NIR Imaging: From Building Blocks and Construction Strategies to Applications.', 'A Series of PSMA-Targeted Near-Infrared Fluorescent Imaging Agents.', 'Off-Peak Near-Infrared-II (NIR-II) Bioimaging of an Immunoconjugate Having Peak Fluorescence Emission in the NIR-I Spectral Region for Improving Tumor Margin Delineation.', 'Not so innocent: Impact of fluorophore chemistry on the in\xa0vivo properties of bioconjugates.']"""

Patients and methods:   One hundred and forty patients aged 45 to 70 years old, with a PSA level between 2.5 and 10 ng/mL and normal digital rectal examinations (DRE), were included in this study between June 2009 and November 2010. The patients were randomly assigned into two groups. The first group received oral levofloxacin 500 mg 1*1 for 21 days; the second, the control group, was given no treatment. Initially, total PSA, free PSA, a DRE, urinary ultrasonography (including prostate volume, postvoiding residual urine), uroflowmetry, International Prostate Symptom Score, National Institutes of Health Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index, and International Index of Erectile Function tests were performed. All of these were repeated at the end of 3 weeks of antibiotic treatment. An additional PSA measurement was also performed at day 10 of the treatment. All patients underwent transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS) guided prostate biopsy at day 21, just the day after the final (third) PSA sampling.  Results:   The mean age of the patients was 59.6 years. Overall, in 23 patients, prostate cancer was detected, including those found in the rebiopsies. Statistically, there were significant changes in values of PSA and its derivatives in the treatment group (from 5.31 to 4.69 and 4.58 ng/mL, consecutively). Focusing on prostate cancer patients in both the treatment and control groups, however, we did not detect any significant change in the same parameters.  Conclusion:   Antibiotic treatment given to the patients with a PSA level between 2.5 and 10 ng/mL can be beneficial, before a decision for TRUS guided prostate biopsy, just in a limited subgroup, by reducing the PSA levels below the threshold value. Considering the large population of patients in the gray zone, however, it still does not provide clear solid evidence for avoiding unnecessary prostate biopsies.""","""['Gokhan Toktas', 'Murat Demiray', 'Erkan Erkan', 'Ramazan Kocaaslan', 'Ugur Yucetas', 'Suleyman Erdinc Unluer']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Endourol""","""['Does free to total ratio of prostate-specific antigen alter decision-making on prostatic biopsy?', 'Analysis of the local control in lymph-node staged localized prostate cancer treated by external beam radiotherapy, assessed by digital rectal examination, serum prostate-specific antigen and biopsy.', 'Detection of prostatic carcinoma: the role of TRUS, TRUS guided biopsy, digital rectal examination, PSA and PSA density.', 'Evaluation of prostate specific antigen density and transrectal ultrasonography-guided biopsies in 100 consecutive patients with a negative digital rectal examination and intermediate serum prostate specific antigen levels.', 'Incidental carcinoma of the prostate.', 'The Relationship Between Prostate Biopsy Results and PSA and Free PSA Ratio Changes in Elevated Serum PSA Patients with and without Antibiotherapy.', 'Antibiotic therapy in patients with high prostate-specific antigen: Is it worth considering?

These AR variants are supposed to support PCa cell growth in an androgen-depleted environment, but their mode of action still remains unresolved. Moreover, recent studies indicate that constitutively active AR variants are expressed in primary prostate tumors and may contribute to tumor progression. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of constitutively active AR variants on the expression of tumor progression markers. N-cadherin expression was analyzed in LNCaP cells overexpressing the wild type AR or a constitutively active AR variant by qRT-PCR, Western blot and immunofluorescence. We showed here for the first time that N-cadherin expression was increased in the presence of constitutively active AR variants. These results were confirmed in C4-2B cells overexpressing these AR variants. Although N-cadherin expression is often associated with a downregulation of E-cadherin, this phenomenon was not observed in our model. Nevertheless, in addition to the increased expression of N-cadherin, an upregulation of other mesenchymal markers expression such as VIMENTIN, SNAIL and ZEB1 was observed in the presence of constitutively active variants.

One such mechanism may be through constitutive activation of the insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) signaling pathway, implicated in the development and progression of prostate cancer. Using the pre-neoplastic NRP-152 rat prostate cell line as a model, we showed that IGF-I induces Survivin expression, and that silencing Survivin by lentiviral-mediated small hairpin RNA (shRNA) represses IGF-I-stimulated cell growth, implicating Survivin as a mediator of this growth response. Moreover, our data support that the induction of Survivin by IGF-I occurs through a transcriptional mechanism that is mediated in part by the PI3K/Akt/mTORC1 pathway. Use of various Survivin promoter-luciferase constructs revealed that the CDE and CHR response elements in the proximal region of the Survivin promoter are involved in this IGF-I response. Transforming growth factor (TGF-β) signaling antagonists similarly activated the Surivin promoter and rendered cells refractory to further promoter activation by IGF-I. IGF-I suppressed levels of phospho-Smads 2 and 3 with kinetics similar to that of Survivin induction. Suppression of TGF-β signaling, either by TGF-β receptor kinase inhibitors or by silencing Smads 2 and 3, induced Survivin expression and promoted cell growth similar to that induced by IGF-I. TGF-β receptor antagonists also rescued cells from down-regulation of Survivin expression and growth suppression by pharmacological inhibitors of PI3K, Akt, MEK and mTOR. Sh-RNA gene silencing studies suggest that mTORC1 induces while mTORC2 represses the expression of Survivin by IGF-I. Taken together, these results suggest that IGF-I signaling through a PI3K/Akt/mTORC1 mechanism elevates expression of Survivin and promotes growth of prostate epithelial cells by suppressing Smad-dependent autocrine TGF-β signaling.""","""['Kyung Song', 'Eswar Shankar', 'Jiayi Yang', 'Kara L Bane', 'Reema Wahdan-Alaswad', 'David Danielpour']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Insulin-like growth factor-I inhibits transcriptional responses of transforming growth factor-beta by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt-dependent suppression of the activation of Smad3 but not Smad2.', 'Insulin-like growth factor I suppresses bone morphogenetic protein signaling in prostate cancer cells by activating mTOR signaling.', 'Rb/E2F4 and Smad2/3 link survivin to TGF-beta-induced apoptosis and tumor progression.', 'The anticancer effects of curcumin via targeting the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling pathway.', 'Growing knowledge of the mTOR signaling network.', 'Jagged-1 is induced by mTOR inhibitors in renal cancer cells through an Akt/ALK5/Smad4-dependent mechanism.', 'Significance of combined TGF-β1 and survivin expression on the prognosis of patients with triple-negative breast cancer.', 'Hypoxia represses early responses of prostate and renal cancer cells to YM155 independent of HIF-1α and HIF-2α.', 'Effects of a combined therapy of bortezomib and ionizing radiation on chondrosarcoma three-dimensional spheroid cultures.', 'Immunohistochemical expression of insulin-like growth factor-1Ec in primary endometrial carcinoma: Association with PTEN, p53 and survivin expression.']"""

To increase efficiency and specificity, we first performed a computational virtual screen of∼60000 compounds against the human Plk1 3-D structure docked to both its kinase and Polo box domain. 370 candidates with the top free-energy scores were subjected to zebrafish assay and 3 were shown to inhibit cell division. Compared to general screen for compounds inhibiting zebrafish embryonic cleavage, computation increased the efficiency by 11 folds. One of the 3 compounds, named I2, was further demonstrated to effectively inhibit multiple tumor cell proliferation in vitro and PC3 prostate cancer growth in Xenograft mouse model in vivo. Furthermore, I2 inhibited Plk1 enzyme activity in a dose dependent manner. The IC50 values of I2 in these assays are compatible to those of ON-01910, a Plk1 inhibitor currently in Phase III clinic trials. Our studies demonstrate that zebrafish assays coupled with computational screening significantly improves the efficiency of identifying specific regulators of biological targets. The PLK1 inhibitor I2, and its analogs, may have potential in cancer therapeutics.""","""['Jing Lu', 'Shengchang Xin', 'Huan Meng', 'Matt Veldman', 'David Schoenfeld', 'Chao Che', 'Ruibin Yan', 'Hanbing Zhong', 'Song Li', 'Shuo Lin']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Genetic approach to evaluate specificity of small molecule drug candidates inhibiting PLK1 using zebrafish.', 'Identification of a novel Polo-like kinase 1 inhibitor that specifically blocks the functions of Polo-Box domain.', 'Nonpeptidic, Polo-Box Domain-Targeted Inhibitors of PLK1 Block Kinase Activity, Induce Its Degradation and Target-Resistant Cells.', 'Plk1-targeted small molecule inhibitors: molecular basis for their potency and specificity.', 'Inhibitors of the Polo-Box Domain of Polo-Like Kinase 1.', 'The Polo-like kinase 1 inhibitor onvansertib represents a relevant treatment for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma resistant to cisplatin and radiotherapy.', 'Identification of Novel Anti-Liver Cancer Small Molecules with Better Therapeutic Index than Sorafenib via Zebrafish Drug Screening Platform.', 'Enrichment of chemical libraries docked to protein conformational ensembles and application to aldehyde dehydrogenase 2.']"""

The objective of this study was to examine serum estrogens and prostate tumor ERβ expression and examine their correlation with clinical and pathological parameters in African American (AA) versus Caucasian American (CA) men. The circulating 17β-estradiol (E2) was measured by enzyme immunoassay in blood procured from racially stratified normal subjects and PCa patients. Differential expression profile analysis of ERβ was analyzed by quantitative immunohistochemistry using ethnicity-based tissue microarray encompassing 300 PCa tissue cores. In situ ERβ expression was validated by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR in matched microdissected normal prostate epithelium and tumor cells and datasets extracted from independent cohorts. In comparison with normal age-matched subjects, circulating E2 levels were significantly elevated in all PCa patients. Further analysis demonstrates an increase in blood E2 levels in AA men in both normal and PCa in comparison with age- and stage-matched counterparts of CA decent. Histochemical score analysis reveals intense nuclear immunoreactivity for ERβ in tumor cores of AA men than in CA men. Gene expression analysis in microdissected tumors corroborated the biracial differences in ERβ expression. Gene expression analysis from independent cohort datasets revealed correlation between ERβ expression and PCa progression. However, unlike in CA men, adjusted multivariate analysis showed that ERβ expression correlates with age at diagnosis and low prostate-specific antigen recurrence-free survival in AA men. Taken together, our results suggest that E2-ERβ axis may have potential clinical utility in PCa diagnosis and clinical outcome among AA men.""","""['Zakaria Y Abd Elmageed', 'Krzysztof Moroz', 'Sudesh K Srivastav', 'Zhide Fang', 'Byron E Crawford', 'Krishnarao Moparty', 'Raju Thomas', 'Asim B Abdel-Mageed']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Carcinogenesis""","""['A Biopsy-based 17-gene Genomic Prostate Score Predicts Recurrence After Radical Prostatectomy and Adverse Surgical Pathology in a Racially Diverse Population of Men with Clinically Low- and Intermediate-risk Prostate Cancer.', 'Epigenetic analysis identifies factors driving racial disparity in prostate cancer.', 'Race-associated expression of MHC class I polypeptide-related sequence A (MICA) in prostate cancer.', 'Racial disparity in prostate cancer in the African American population with actionable ideas and novel immunotherapies.', 'Molecular basis for prostate cancer racial disparities.', 'Pseurotin A Validation as a Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Recurrence-Suppressing Lead via PCSK9-LDLR Axis Modulation.', 'Small extracellular vesicle-associated miR-6068 promotes aggressive phenotypes of prostate cancer through miR-6068/HIC2/SIRT1 axis.', 'Identification of novel biomarkers differentially expressed between African-American and Caucasian-American prostate cancer patients.', 'Transmembrane and Tetratricopeptide Repeat Containing 4 Is a Novel Diagnostic Marker for Prostate Cancer with High Specificity and Sensitivity.', 'Exosomes-Mediated Transfer of Itga2 Promotes Migration and Invasion of Prostate Cancer Cells by Inducing Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition.']"""

The molecular mechanisms underlying this process are poorly recognized. Our study aimed at testing in vitro the role of hASH-1, a transcription factor implicated in neuroendocrine differentiation, in the onset of neuroendocrine phenotype in prostate cancer cells.  Methods:   Androgen sensitive LNCAP, androgen insensitive PC-3, and three immortalized prostate cancer cell lines were cultured in standard and androgen deprivation conditions. Expression of hASH-1 was modulated by either specific lentiviral transduction or shRNA interference. Inhibitors of WNT-11, a WNT family member associated to the development of neuroendocrine differentiation in prostate cancer, were also used. Cell viability was measured using the MTS method. Neuroendocrine phenotype was assessed by morphology, immunohistochemistry and real time PCR for several neuroendocrine markers.  Results:   hASH-1 was up-modulated by androgen deprivation in LNCaP cells and in androgen-sensitive immortalized prostate cancer cells, and associated with the onset of a neuroendocrine phenotype. Silencing of hASH-1 prevented neuroendocrine differentiation, as did also the selective interference with the WNT-11 pathway. Moreover, hASH-1 over-expression in LNCaP cells was sufficient to promote neuroendocrine differentiation and increased cell viability at basal and androgen-deprived growth conditions.  Conclusion:   In summary, the present data support previous evidence that the acquisition of a neuroendocrine phenotype is linked to androgen responsiveness profiles and suggest a pivotal role of hASH-1 transcription factor, whose activity might be explored as a potential therapeutic target in prostate cancer, with special reference to hormone refractory disease.""","""['Ida Rapa', 'Marco Volante', 'Cristina Migliore', 'Antonella Farsetti', 'Alfredo Berruti', 'Giorgio Vittorio Scagliotti', 'Silvia Giordano', 'Mauro Papotti']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Androgen deprivation of the PC-310 correction of prohormone convertase-310 human prostate cancer model system induces neuroendocrine differentiation.', 'N-cadherin increases after androgen deprivation and is associated with metastasis in prostate cancer.', 'The influence of neuroendocrine differentiation on the growth and androgen receptor expression of prostate carcinoma cells.', 'The neuroendocrine phenotype in prostate cancer: basic and clinical aspects.', 'Neuroendocrine-like prostate cancer cells: neuroendocrine transdifferentiation of prostate adenocarcinoma cells.', 'ASCL1 activates neuronal stem cell-like lineage programming through remodeling of the chromatin landscape in prostate cancer.', 'Elevated ASCL1 activity creates de novo regulatory elements associated with neuronal differentiation.', 'Regulation of Neuroendocrine-like Differentiation in Prostate Cancer by Non-Coding RNAs.', 'Dephosphorylation of the Proneural Transcription Factor ASCL1 Re-Engages a Latent Post-Mitotic Differentiation Program in Neuroblastoma.', 'ASCL1 regulates neurodevelopmental transcription factors and cell cycle genes in brain tumors of glioma mouse models.']"""

There is also evidence to suggest progression of low-risk prostate cancer to develop higher grades and volumes of prostate cancer during active surveillance. It is unknown as to what affect a delay in referral of those men with abnormal screened-PSA levels have on subsequent Gleason grade.  Methods:   We identified 350 men through our rapid access prostate clinic who underwent TRUS biopsy for abnormal age-related PSA and/or abnormal clinical examination. Clinicopathological findings were compared for those with positive versus negative TRUS biopsies, and for those with initial delays in referral (<12 months, 12-18 months, and >18 months). We used ANOVA and Student's t-tests amongst other statistical tools to examine significance of clinical findings.  Results:   Of the 350 men who underwent TRUS biopsy, those with a delay in referral of 12 months or more were significantly associated with higher PSA titers, clinically palpable disease and likelihood of diagnosis with prostate cancer. A delay of 18 months or more led to a significantly higher risk of being diagnosed with a leading grade 4 prostate cancer, which was further supported using PSA velocity as a diagnostic tool (change >0.4 ng/ml/year).  Conclusion:   We recommend that repeated asymptomatic abnormal age-related PSA readings and/or abnormal clinical examination in the screened population be referred without delay to a urologist for further assessment, enrolment into an active surveillance program or definitive subsequent treatment.""","""[""Fardod O'Kelly"", 'Arun Thomas', 'Denise Murray', 'David Galvin', 'David Mulvin', 'David M Quinlan']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Early detection of high-grade prostate cancer using digital rectal examination (DRE) in men with a prostate-specific antigen level of <2.5 ng/mL and the risk of death.', 'Digital rectal examination in primary care is important for early detection of prostate cancer: a retrospective cohort analysis study.', 'Clinical value of prostate specific antigen screening in early detection of prostate cancer.', 'Prostate biopsy: who, how and when.

Among inflammatory regulators, toll-like receptors (TLRs) have a critical role in innate immune responses. However, it remains unclear whether variant TLR genes influence PCA risk among men of African descent. Therefore, we evaluated the impact of 32 TLR-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on PCA risk among African Americans and Jamaicans. SNP profiles of 814 subjects were evaluated using Illumina's Veracode genotyping platform. Single and combined effects of SNPs in relation to PCA risk were assessed using age-adjusted logistic regression and entropy-based multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) models. Seven sequence variants detected in TLR6, TOLLIP (Toll-interacting protein), IRAK4 (interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 4) and IRF3 (interferon regulatory factor 3) were marginally related to PCA. However, none of these effects remained significant after adjusting for multiple hypothesis testing. Nevertheless, MDR modeling revealed a complex interaction between IRAK4 rs4251545 and TLR2 rs1898830 as a significant predictor of PCA risk among US men (permutation testing P-value=0.001).

Increasing extracellular copper concentrations enhanced the therapeutic capacity of both Cu(II)(gtsm) and Cu(II)(atsm), and their ligands (H2gtsm and H2atsm) were toxic only toward cancerous prostate cells when combined with copper.

We examined the temporal relationship between DM and prostate cancer risk exploring the period of greatest risk starting from the prediabetic to the post-diabetic period using clinical and administrative data to accurately define the date of DM diagnosis.  Methods:   We identified 5,813 men who developed DM between January 1, 1995 and December 31, 2009 (reference date, date of DM onset or matched date for non-diabetic cohort) and 28,019 non-diabetic men matched by age, smoking history, residence, and reference date. Prostate cancer incidence before and after the reference date was assessed using Cox regression modeling adjusted for matching variables, body mass index, insurance status, and comorbidities. Primary outcomes included hazard ratio (HR) and number needed to be exposed to DM for one additional person to be harmed (NNEH) or benefit (NNEB) with respect to prostate cancer risk.  Results:   After full adjustment, the HR for prostate cancer before DM diagnosis was 0.96 (95% CI 0.85-1.08; P=0.4752), and the NNEB was 974 at DM diagnosis. After the reference date, the fully-adjusted HR for prostate cancer in diabetic men was 0.84 (95% CI 0.72-0.97, P=0.0167), and the NNEB 3 years after DM onset was 425.

We report herein that for aggressive prostate carcinoma, acknowledged to be reprogrammed toward an anabolic phenotype and to upload lactate to drive proliferation, extracellular acidification is mainly mediated by stromal cells engaged in a molecular cross-talk circuitry with cancer cells. Indeed, cancer-associated fibroblasts, upon their activation by cancer delivered soluble factors, rapidly express carbonic anhydrase IX (CA IX). While expression of CAIX in cancer cells has already been correlated with poor prognosis in various human tumors, the novelty of our findings is the upregulation of CAIX in stromal cells upon activation. The de novo expression of CA IX, which is not addicted to hypoxic conditions, is driven by redox-based stabilization of hypoxia-inducible factor-1. Extracellular acidification due to carbonic anhydrase IX is mandatory to elicit activation of stromal fibroblasts delivered metalloprotease-2 and -9, driving in cancer cells the epithelial-mesenchymal transition epigenetic program, a key event associated with increased motility, survival and stemness. Both genetic silencing and pharmacological inhibition of CA IX (with sulfonamide/sulfamides potent inhibitors) or metalloprotease-9 are sufficient to impede epithelial-mesenchymal transition and invasiveness of prostate cancer cells induced by contact with cancer-associated fibroblasts.

Semi-structured interviews were analysed with theoretical thematic analysis guided by a material discursive intra-psychic approach, recognising the materiality of sexual changes, men's intrapsychic experience of such changes within a relational context and the influence of the discursive construction of masculine sexuality. Material changes included erectile difficulty, decreased desire, and difficulty with orgasm. The use of medical aids to minimise the impact of erectile difficulties was shaped by discursive constructions of 'normal' masculine sexuality.

The utility of the M13 display platform is derived from the ability to encode phage protein fusions with display peptides at the genomic level. However, the genome of the phage is complicated by overlaps of key genetic elements. These overlaps directly couple the coding sequence of one gene to the coding or regulatory sequence of another, making it difficult to alter one gene without disrupting the other. Specifically, overlap of the end of gene VII and the beginning of gene IX has prevented the functional genomic modification of the N-terminus of p9. By redesigning the M13 genome to physically separate these overlapping genetic elements, a process known as ""refactoring,"" we enabled independent manipulation of gene VII and gene IX and the construction of the first N-terminal genomic modification of p9 for peptide display. We demonstrate the utility of this refactored genome by developing an M13 bacteriophage-based platform for targeted imaging of and drug delivery to prostate cancer cells in vitro. This successful use of refactoring principles to re-engineer a natural biological system strengthens the suggestion that natural genomes can be rationally designed for a number of applications.""","""['Debadyuti Ghosh#', 'Aditya G Kohli#', 'Felix Moser', 'Drew Endy', 'Angela M Belcher']""","""[]""","""2012""","""None""","""ACS Synth Biol""","""['General M13 phage display: M13 phage display in identification and characterization of protein-protein interactions.', 'Engineering M13 for phage display.', 'Biomimetic self-templating optical structures fabricated by genetically engineered M13 bacteriophage.', 'Investigation of intestinal transportation of peptide-displaying bacteriophage particles using phage display method.', 'Random sequence libraries displayed on phage: identification of biologically important molecules.', 'Understanding the Role of M13 Bacteriophage Thin Films on a Metallic Nanostructure through a Standard and Dynamic Model.', 'Engineered M13 phage as a novel therapeutic bionanomaterial for clinical applications: From tissue regeneration to cancer therapy.', 'Precision Killing of M2 Macrophages with Phage-Displayed Peptide-Photosensitizer Conjugates.', 'Forging the Frontiers of Image-Guided Neurosurgery-The Emerging Uses of Theranostics in Neurosurgical Oncology.', 'Generating dynamic gene expression patterns without the need for regulatory circuits.']"""

The presence of circulating prostate cells (CPCs) in men without evidence of BF may be useful to predict patients at risk for BF. We describe the frequency of CPCs detected after RP, relation with clinicopathological parameters, and association with biochemical failure.  Methods and patients:   Serial blood samples were taken during followup after RP, mononuclear cells were obtained by differential gel centrifugation, and CPCs identified using standard immunocytochemistry using anti-PSA monoclonal antibodies. Age, pathological stage (organ confined, nonorgan confined), pathological grade, margin status (positive, negative), extracapsular extension, perineural, vascular, and lymphatic infiltration (positive, negative) were compared with the presence/absence of CPCs and with and without biochemical failure. Kaplan Meier methods were used to compare the unadjusted biochemical failure free survival of patients with and without CPCs.  Results:   114 men participated, and secondary CPCs were detected more frequently in patients with positive margins, extracapsular extension, and vascular and lymphatic infiltration and were associated with biochemical failure independent of these clinicopathological variables, and with a shorter time to BF.  Conclusions:   Secondary CPCs are an independent risk factor associated with increased BF in men with a PSA <0.2 ng/mL after radical prostatectomy, but do not determine if the recurrence is due to local or systemic disease. These results warrant larger studies to confirm the findings.""","""['Nigel P Murray', 'Eduardo Reyes', 'Nelson Orellana', 'Cynthia Fuentealba', 'Leonardo Bádinez', 'Ruben Olivares', 'José Porcell', 'Ricardo Dueñas']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""ScientificWorldJournal""","""['Elimination of primary circulating prostate cells after radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer decreases the risk of future biochemical failure.', '10 Year Biochemical Failure Free Survival of Men with CD82 Positive Primary Circulating Prostate Cells Treated by Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Comparison of the Walz Nomogram and Presence of Secondary Circulating Prostate Cells for Predicting Early Biochemical Failure after Radical Prostatectomy for Prostate Cancer in Chilean Men.', 'The presence of secondary circulating prostate tumour cells determines the risk of biochemical relapse for patients with low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancer who are treated only with external radiotherapy.', 'Controversies associated with the evaluation of elderly men with localized prostate cancer when considering radical prostatectomy.', 'Application of Primary/Secondary Circulating Tumor Cells for the Prediction of Biochemical Recurrence in Nonmetastatic Prostate Cancer Patients following Radical Prostatectomy or Radiotherapy: A Meta-Analysis.', 'Position of Circulating Tumor Cells in the Clinical Routine in Prostate Cancer and Breast Cancer Patients.', 'Detection and isolation of disseminated tumor cells in bone marrow of patients with clinically localized prostate cancer.', 'Research landscape of liquid biopsies in prostate cancer.', 'Subtypes of minimal residual disease, association with Gleason score, risk and time to biochemical failure in pT2 prostate cancer treated with radical prostatectomy.']"""

We conducted a study to better profile the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and biodistribution of this agent.  Methods:   Ten patients received either 50, 100, or 200 kBq of ²²³Ra per kilogram of body weight. Subsequently, six of these ten patients received a second dose of 50 kBq/kg. Pharmacokinetics and biodistribution were assessed by serial blood sampling, planar imaging, and whole-body counting. Pharmacodynamic assessment was based on measurements of prostate-specific antigen, bone alkaline phosphatase, and serum N-telopeptide. Safety was also assessed.  Results:   Pharmacokinetic studies showed rapid clearance of ²²³Ra from the vasculature, with a median of 14% (range 9-34%), 2% (range 1.6-3.9%), and 0.5% (range 0.4-1.0%) remaining in plasma at the end of infusion, after 4 h, and after 24 h, respectively. Biodistribution studies showed early passage into the small bowel and subsequent fecal excretion with a median of 52% of administered ²²³Ra in the bowel at 24 h. Urinary excretion was relatively minor (median of 4% of administered ²²³Ra). Bone retention was prolonged. No dose-limiting toxicity was observed. Pharmacodynamic effects were observed (alkaline phosphatase and serum N-telopeptides) in a significant fraction of patients.

CXCR6 signalling stimulates the conversion of mesenchymal stem cells into cancer-associated fibroblasts, which secrete stromal-derived factor-1, also known as CXCL12.

It is also broadly expressed in many types of tissues. Recent studies have showed that CD73 is widely expressed on malignancies and is up-regulated in cancerous tissues. Consequently, we analyzed the expression of CD73 in prostate cancer tissue. The expression of the CD73 protein was evaluated by Immunohistochemistry staining in 116 tissue specimens. The expression was further examined by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western blot in the same set of patients. The intense cell membrane staining for the CD73 protein was observed. The expression of CD73 in lymph node non-metastasizing prostate cancer tissues can be seen at low levels, and is generally undetectable. RT-PCR and Western blot showed that the expression of CD73 in lymph node metastasizing prostate cancer was higher compared with non-metastasizing ones.

Information on the occurrence of prostate cancer was obtained through record linkages across the Icelandic Cancer Registry. We used Cox regression models with 95% confidence intervals (CI) to estimate HRs of prostate cancer by symptoms of sleep disruption.  Results:   During follow-up, 135 men (6.4%) were diagnosed with prostate cancer. Compared with men without sleep disruption, those with problems falling and staying asleep were at significantly increased risk of prostate cancer [HR, 1.7 (95% CI, 1.0-2.9) and 2.1 (95% CI, 1.2-3.7)], respectively, with increasing sleep disruption severity.

The results did not change after excluding from the analyses men who woke up during the night, indicative of nocturia, suggesting limited risk of reverse association.  Conclusions:   Our data suggest that certain aspects of sleep disruption may confer an increased risk of prostate cancer and call for additional, larger studies with longer follow-up times.

The reported magnitudes of the rotations, however, are often greater than the typical range of a six-degree treatment couch. The purpose of this study is to quantify geometric and dosimetric effects if the prostate rotations are not corrected (ROT_NC) and if they can be compensated with translational shifts (ROT_C). Forty-three kilovoltage cone-beam CTs (KV-CBCT) with implanted markers from five patients were available for this retrospective study. On each KV-CBCT, the prostate, bladder, and rectum were manually contoured by a physician. The prostate contours from the planning CT and CBCT were aligned manually to achieve the best overlaps. This contour registration served as the benchmark method for comparison with two marker registration methods: (a) using six degrees of freedom, but rotations were not corrected (ROT_NC); and (b) using three degrees of freedom while compensating rotations into the translational shifts (ROT_C). The center of mass distance (CMD) and overlap index (OI) were used to evaluate these two methods. The dosimetric effects were also analyzed by comparing the dose coverage of the prostate clinical target volume (CTV) in relation to the planning margins. According to our analysis, the detected rotations dominated in the left-right axis with systematic and random components of 4.6° and 4.1°, respectively. When the rotation angles were greater than 10°, the differences in CMD between the two registrations were greater than 5 mm in 85.7% of these fractions; when the rotation angles were greater than 6°, the differences of CMD were greater than 4 mm in 61.1% of these fractions. With 6 mm/4 mm posterior planning margins, the average difference between the dose to 99% (D99) of the prostate in CBCTs and the planning D99 of the prostate was -8.0 ± 12.3% for the ROT_NC registration, and -3.6 ± 9.0% for the ROT_C registration (p = 0.01). When the planning margin decreased to 4 mm/2 mm posterior, the average difference in D99 of the prostate was -22.0 ± 16.2% and -15.1 ± 15.2% for the ROT_NC and ROT_C methods, respectively (p &lt; 0.05). In conclusion, prostate rotation cannot be simply dismissed, and the impact of the rotational errors depends on the distance between the isocenter and the centroid of implanted markers and the rotation angle.""","""['Qingyang Shang', 'Lawrence J Sheplan Olsen', 'Kevin Stephans', 'Rahul Tendulkar', 'Ping Xia']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Appl Clin Med Phys""","""['A novel approach for evaluation of prostate deformation and associated dosimetric implications in IGRT of the prostate.', 'Pelvic nodal dosing with registration to the prostate: implications for high-risk prostate cancer patients receiving stereotactic body radiation therapy.', 'The potential failure risk of the cone-beam computed tomography-based planning target volume margin definition for prostate image-guided radiotherapy based on a prospective single-institutional hybrid analysis.', 'Geometric and dosimetric evaluations of an online image-guidance strategy for 3D-CRT of prostate cancer.', 'Adaptive optimization by 6 DOF robotic couch in prostate volumetric IMRT treatment: rototranslational shift and dosimetric consequences.', 'Impact of rotational errors of whole pelvis on the dose of prostate-based image-guided radiotherapy to pelvic lymph nodes and small bowel in high-risk prostate cancer.', 'Automated treatment planning of prostate stereotactic body radiotherapy with focal boosting on a fast-rotating O-ring linac: Plan quality comparison with C-arm linacs.', 'Volumetric-based image guidance is superior to marker-based alignments for stereotactic body radiotherapy of prostate cancer.', 'Target margins in radiotherapy of prostate cancer.', 'Comparison of manual and automatic MR-CT registration for radiotherapy of prostate cancer.']"""

The majority of brachytherapy implant volumes are not homogeneous media. Particularly, an implant with multiple seeds significantly changes homogeneity of the implant volume. Heterogeneities, such as attenuation by adjacent seeds or interseed attenuation (ISA), are neglected to this day in all BTPS. The goal of this project is to determine a novel analytical method to evaluate the impact of the dose perturbations (P-value) and/or interseed attenuation effect (ISA-value). This method will be validated for low- and high-energy brachytherapy seeds such as 125I and 192Ir using Monte Carlo (MC) simulation techniques. In this analytical model, determination of dose perturbation and interseed attenuation in a multisource brachytherapy implant is based on MC-simulated 3D kernels of P-values and ISA data for single active and single dummy configurations, arranged at different distances and orientations relative to each other. The accuracy of the final model in multisource implant configurations has been examined by a comparison of the calculated P-values and ISA-values with full Monte Carlo water simulations (FMCWS). This model enabled us to determine the total perturbation and ISA values for any multisource implant, and the results are in excellent agreement with the FMCWS data. The advantage of this model to FMCWS for daily clinical application is the speed of the calculations and ease of the implementation. The new perturbation and ISA formulism have shown a better accuracy for 192Ir than 125I due to Compton scattering and its independence of the atomic number of the chemical composition of the phantom materials. The maximum difference between the ISA model and FMCWS for all cases was less than 5%. This new model can provide inputs for brachytherapy planning software to consider the ISA effect in dose calculations based on TG-43U1 algorithm.

The novel RapidArc technique represents a further step forward because of the lower number of MUs per fraction and the shorter delivery time, compared to IMRT. This paper refers to MU optimization in RA plans for prostate cancer, using a tool incorporated in Varian TPS Eclipse. The goal was to get the lowest MU RA plan for each patient, keeping a well-defined level of PTV coverage and OAR sparing. Seven prostate RA plans (RA MU-Optimized) were retrospectively generated using the MU optimization tool in Varian Eclipse TPS. Dosimetric outcome and nontarget tissue sparing were, compared to those of RA clinical plans (RA Clinical) used to treat patients. Compared to RA Clinical, RA MU-Optimized plans resulted in an about 28% (p = 0.018) reduction in MU. The total integral dose (ID) to each nontarget tissue (but not the penile bulb) showed a consistent average relative reduction, statistically significant only for the femoral heads. Within the intermediate dose region (40-60 Gy), ID reductions (4%-17% p &lt; 0.05) were found for the rectum, while a slight but significant (0.4%-0.9%, p &lt; 0.05) higher ID was found for the whole body. Among the remaining data, the mean dose to the bladder was also reduced (-12%, p = 0.028). Plans using MU optimization are clinically applicable and more MU efficient, ameliorating the exposure of the rectum and the bladder to intermediate doses.""","""['Stefania Clemente', 'Mariella Cozzolino', 'Costanza Chiumento', 'Alba Fiorentino', 'Rocchina Caivano', 'Vincenzo Fusco']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Appl Clin Med Phys""","""['A dosimetric comparison of RapidArc and IMRT with hypofractionated simultaneous integrated boost to the prostate for treatment of prostate cancer.', 'Dosimetric study of different radiotherapy planning approaches for hippocampal avoidance whole-brain radiation therapy (HA-WBRT) based on fused CT and MRI imaging.', 'Radiotherapy treatment plans with RapidArc for prostate cancer involving seminal vesicles and lymph nodes.', 'Feasibility of the partial-single arc technique in RapidArc planning for prostate cancer treatment.', 'Intensity-modulated radiation therapy for pancreatic and prostate cancer using pulsed low-dose rate delivery techniques.', 'On the reduction of aperture complexity in kidney SABR.', 'Hybrid volumetric modulated arc therapy for hypofractionated radiotherapy of breast cancer: a\xa0treatment planning study.', 'Limiting treatment plan complexity by applying a novel commercial tool.', 'Performance of the eclipse monitor unit objective tool utilizing volumetric modulated arc therapy for rectal cancer.', 'Assessment of the Monitor Unit Objective tool for VMAT in the Eclipse treatment planning system.']"""

However, the extent of improvement on MU efficiency varies, depending on the implementation and design of one-step optimization. In this paper, we attempted to investigate MU efficiency issue in two methods of one-step optimization implemented in two commercial treatment planning systems (TPSs). Five patients with nasopharyngeal cancer and five patients with advanced prostate cancer were selected for this study. For these patients, clinically used IMRT plans were generated using the Direct Machine Parameter Optimization (DMPO) in the Pinnacle TPS. New IMRT plans were created using the Direct Aperture Optimization (DAO) method in the Panther TPS. For the purpose of this study, we used the similar planning dose objectives and beam configurations with a similar total number of segments in each pair of DMPO and DAO plans. With similar plan quality, DMPO plans required more MUs than DAO plans. The average number of MUs (expressed in mean ± 1 SD) for the DMPO and DAO plans was 1,169 ± 186 and 671 ± 135 for the nasopharynx cases, and 711 ± 48 and 400 ± 65 for the prostate cases, respectively. The average segment areas (expressed in mean ± 1 SD) for the DMPO plans were smaller than those for the DAO plans: 46.0 ± 7.6 cm2 vs. 100.9 ± 32.3 cm2 for the nasopharynx cases, and 58.3 ± 17.2 cm2 vs. 97.4 ± 35.0 cm2 for the prostate cases, respectively. In conclusion, two one-step optimization algorithms, DMPO and DAO, resulted in much different MU efficiency with the similar number of segments and optimization parameters. This MU difference is largely attributed to the fact that large area segments are used more often in DAO plans than in DMPO plans.""","""['Peng Qi', 'Ping Xia']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Appl Clin Med Phys""","""['Intensity-modulated radiotherapy of breast cancer using direct aperture optimization.', 'Parameter optimization in HN-IMRT for Elekta linacs.', 'Clinical evaluation of direct aperture optimization when applied to head-and-neck IMRT.', 'The impact of direct aperture optimization on plan quality and efficiency in complex head and neck IMRT.', 'Direct aperture optimization as a means of reducing the complexity of Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy plans.', 'Dosimetric sensitivity of leaf width on volumetric modulated arc therapy plan quality: an objective approach.', 'Beam complexity and monitor unit efficiency comparison in two different volumetric modulated arc therapy delivery systems using automated planning.', 'Limiting treatment plan complexity by applying a novel commercial tool.', 'Plan quality comparison for cervical carcinoma treated with Halcyon and Trilogy intensity-modulated radiotherapy.', 'An empirical method for automatic determination of maximum number of segments in DMPO-based IMRT for Head and Neck cases.']"""

Dosimetry and radiobiological model comparison between the single-arc and double-arc prostate VMAT plans were performed on five patients with prostate volumes ranging from 29-68.1 cm3. The prescription dose was 78 Gy/39 fractions and the photon beam energy was 6 MV. Dose-volume histogram, mean and maximum dose of targets (planning and clinical target volume) and normal tissues (rectum, bladder and femoral heads), dose-volume criteria in the treatment plan (D99% of PTV; D30%, D50%, V17Gy and V35Gy of rectum and bladder; D5% of femoral heads), and dose profiles along the vertical and horizontal axis crossing the isocenter were determined using the single-arc and double-arc VMAT technique. For comparison, the monitor unit based on the RapidArc delivery method, prostate tumor control probability (TCP), and rectal normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) based on the Lyman-Burman-Kutcher algorithm were calculated. It was found that though the double-arc technique required almost double the treatment time than the single-arc, the double-arc plan provided a better rectal and bladder dose-volume criteria by shifting the delivered dose in the patient from the anterior-posterior direction to the lateral. As the femoral head was less radiosensitive than the rectum and bladder, the double-arc technique resulted in a prostate VMAT plan with better prostate coverage and rectal dose-volume criteria compared to the single-arc. The prostate TCP of the double-arc plan was found slightly increased (0.16%) compared to the single-arc.

Material and methods:   Between 1995 and 2010, a total of 1,350 consecutive patients underwent radical prostatectomy. Patients were followed prospectively per protocol. No patients were lost to follow-up. Overall and cause-specific survival were described using Kaplan-Meier plots. Standardized relative survival and mortality ratio were calculated based on expected survival in the age-matched Danish population using the methods and macros described by Dickmann. The country-specific population mortality rates used for calculation of the expected survival were based on data from The Human Mortality Database.  Results:   The median follow-up was 3.4 years (range: 0-14.3 years). A total of 59 (4.4%) patients died during follow-up. In all, 17 (1.3%) patients died of prostate cancer. The estimated ten-year overall survival was 89.3%. The cancer-specific survival was estimated to 96.6% after ten years. Relative survival was 1.04 after five years and 1.14 after ten years. The standardized mortality ratio, i.e. observed mortality/expected mortality, was 0.61 and 0.39 at five and ten years, respectively.  Conclusion:   The overall and cancer-specific ten-year survival in a consecutive series of patients in a non-screened Danish population is ≥ 89%. The survival and mortality ratio is significantly better than expected in the age-matched background population. This finding is likely explained by selection bias.

IRS2 is associated with cancer cell motility and metastasis. Currently, there are no anticancer agents that target IRS1/2. We present new IGF-IR/IRS-targeted agents (NT compounds) that promote inhibitory Ser-phosphorylation and degradation of IRS1 and IRS2. Elimination of IRS1/2 results in long-term inhibition of IRS1/2-mediated signaling. The therapeutic significance of this inhibition in cancer cells was shown while unraveling a novel mechanism of resistance to B-RAF(V600E/K) inhibitors. We found that IRS1 is upregulated in PLX4032-resistant melanoma cells and in cell lines derived from patients whose tumors developed PLX4032 resistance. In both settings, NT compounds led to the elimination of IRS proteins and evoked cell death. Treatment with NT compounds in vivo significantly inhibited the growth of PLX4032-resistant tumors and displayed potent antitumor effects in ovarian and prostate cancers. Our findings offer preclinical proof-of-concept for IRS1/2 inhibitors as cancer therapeutics including PLX4032-resistant melanoma.

Changes in protein glycosylation are believed to occur in many diseases, particularly during cancer initiation and progression. The identification of biomarkers for human disease states is becoming increasingly important, as early detection is key to improving survival and recovery rates. To this end, the serum glycome has been proposed as a potential source of biomarkers for different types of cancers.High-throughput hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) technology for glycan analysis allows for the detailed quantification of the glycan content in human serum. However, the experimental data from this analysis is compositional by nature. Compositional data are subject to a constant-sum constraint, which restricts the sample space to a simplex. Statistical analysis of glycan chromatography datasets should account for their unusual mathematical properties.As the volume of glycan HILIC data being produced increases, there is a considerable need for a framework to support appropriate statistical analysis. Proposed here is a methodology for feature selection in compositional data. The principal objective is to provide a template for the analysis of glycan chromatography data that may be used to identify potential glycan biomarkers.  Results:   A greedy search algorithm, based on the generalized Dirichlet distribution, is carried out over the feature space to search for the set of ""grouping variables"" that best discriminate between known group structures in the data, modelling the compositional variables using beta distributions. The algorithm is applied to two glycan chromatography datasets. Statistical classification methods are used to test the ability of the selected features to differentiate between known groups in the data. Two well-known methods are used for comparison: correlation-based feature selection (CFS) and recursive partitioning (rpart). CFS is a feature selection method, while recursive partitioning is a learning tree algorithm that has been used for feature selection in the past.  Conclusions:   The proposed feature selection method performs well for both glycan chromatography datasets. It is computationally slower, but results in a lower misclassification rate and a higher sensitivity rate than both correlation-based feature selection and the classification tree method.""","""['Marie C Galligan', 'Radka Saldova', 'Matthew P Campbell', 'Pauline M Rudd', 'Thomas B Murphy']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""BMC Bioinformatics""","""['Novel glycan biomarkers for the detection of lung cancer.', 'Comprehensive native glycan profiling with isomer separation and quantitation for the discovery of cancer biomarkers.', 'Exploring serum and immunoglobulin G N-glycome as diagnostic biomarkers for early detection of breast cancer in Ethiopian women.', 'Glycans as cancer biomarkers.', 'Glycoproteins in the Sera of Oncological Patients.', 'Association Between Human Gut Microbiome and N-Glycan Composition of Total Plasma Proteome.', 'Factors influencing job preferences of health workers providing obstetric care: results from discrete choice experiments in Malawi, Mozambique and Tanzania.']"""

Although SRC-3 is highly expressed in advanced prostate cancer, its role in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) driven by PTEN mutation is unknown. We documented elevated SRC-3 in human CRPC and in PTEN-negative human prostate cancer. Patients with high SRC-3 and undetectable PTEN exhibited decreased recurrence-free survival. To explore the causal relationship in these observations, we generated mice in which both Pten and SRC-3 were inactivated in prostate epithelial cells (Pten3CKO mice), comparing them with mice in which only Pten was inactivated in these cells (PtenCKO mice). SRC-3 deletion impaired cellular proliferation and reduced tumor size. Notably, while castration of PtenCKO control mice increased the aggressiveness of prostate tumors relative to noncastrated counterparts, deletion of SRC-3 in Pten3CKO mice reversed all these changes. In support of this finding, castrated Pten3CKO mice also exhibited decreased levels of phospho-Akt, S6 kinase (RPS6KB1), and phosphorylated S6 protein (RPS6), all of which mediate cell growth and proliferation. Moreover, these tumors appeared to be more differentiated as evidenced by higher levels of Fkbp5, an AR-responsive gene that inhibits Akt signaling. Lastly, these tumors also displayed lower levels of certain androgen-repressed genes such as cyclin E2 and MMP10. Together, our results show that SRC-3 drives CRPC formation and offer preclinical proof of concept for a transcriptional coactivator as a therapeutic target to abrogate CRPC progression.""","""['Jean C-Y Tien', 'Zhaoliang Liu', 'Lan Liao', 'Fen Wang', 'Yixiang Xu', 'Ye-Lin Wu', 'Niya Zhou', 'Michael Ittmann', 'Jianming Xu']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Cancer Res""","""['Effect of dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids on castration-resistant Pten-null prostate cancer.', 'Patient-derived Hormone-naive Prostate Cancer Xenograft Models Reveal Growth Factor Receptor Bound Protein 10 as an Androgen Receptor-repressed Gene Driving the Development of Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'HOXC8 inhibits androgen receptor signaling in human prostate cancer cells by inhibiting SRC-3 recruitment to direct androgen target genes.', 'Deregulated PTEN/PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling in prostate cancer: Still a potential druggable target?', 'Oxidative stress and androgen receptor signaling in the development and progression of castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Mechanisms of Prostate Cancer Cells Survival and Their Therapeutic Targeting.', 'Prostate Cancer Epigenetic Plasticity and Enhancer Heterogeneity: Molecular Causes, Consequences and Clinical Implications.', 'CBP/p300: Critical Co-Activators for Nuclear Steroid Hormone Receptors and Emerging Therapeutic Targets in Prostate and Breast Cancers.', 'SRC-3, a Steroid Receptor Coactivator: Implication in Cancer.', 'Nuclear Receptor Coactivator NCOA3 Regulates UV Radiation-Induced DNA Damage and Melanoma Susceptibility.']"""

Yet, PrCS discussions remain complex, challenging and often emotional for physicians and average-risk men.  Objective:   In July 2011, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention convened a multidisciplinary expert panel to identify priorities for funding agencies and development groups to promote evidence-based, value-concordant decisions between men at average risk for prostate cancer and their physicians.  Design:   Two-day multidisciplinary expert panel in Atlanta, Georgia, with structured discussions and formal consensus processes.  Participants:   Sixteen panelists represented diverse specialties (primary care, medical oncology, urology), disciplines (sociology, communication, medical education, clinical epidemiology) and market sectors (patient advocacy groups, Federal funding agencies, guideline-development organizations).  Main measures:   Panelists used guiding interactional and evaluation models to identify and rate strategies that might improve PrCS discussions and decisions for physicians, patients and health systems/society. Efficacy was defined as the likelihood of each strategy to impact outcomes. Effort was defined as the relative amount of effort to develop, implement and sustain the strategy. Each strategy was rated (1-7 scale; 7 = maximum) using group process software (ThinkTank(TM)). For each group, intervention strategies were grouped as financial/regulatory, educational, communication or attitudinal levers. For each strategy, barriers were identified.  Key results:   Highly ranked strategies to improve value-concordant shared decision-making (SDM) included: changing outpatient clinic visit reimbursement to reward SDM; development of evidence-based, technology-assisted, point-of-service tools for physicians and patients; reframing confusing prostate cancer screening messages; providing pre-visit decision support interventions; utilizing electronic health records to promote benchmarking/best practices; providing additional training for physicians around value-concordant decision-making; and using re-accreditation to promote training.  Conclusions:   Conference outcomes present an expert consensus of strategies likely to improve value-concordant prostate cancer screening decisions.

We assessed the link between serum iron (SI), total-iron binding capacity (TIBC), and risk of cancer by levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) in a large population-based study (n = 220,642).  Methods:   From the Swedish Apolipoprotein Mortality Risk (AMORIS) study, we selected all participants (>20 years old) with baseline measurements of serum SI, TIBC, and CRP. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression was carried out for standardized and quartile values of SI and TIBC. Similar analyses were performed for specific cancers (pancreatic, colon, liver, respiratory, kidney, prostate, stomach, and breast cancer). To avoid reverse causation, we excluded those with follow-up <3 years.  Results:   We found a positive association between standardized TIBC and overall cancer [HR 1.03 (95% CI 1.01-1.05)]. No statistically significant association was found between SI and cancer risk except for postmenopausal breast cancer [HR for standardized SI 1.09 (95% CI 1.02-1.15)]. The association between TIBC and specific cancer was only statistically significant for colon cancer [i.e., HR for standardized TIBC: 1.17 (95% CI 1.08-1.28)]. A borderline interaction between SI and levels of CRP was observed only in stomach cancer.

Experimental design:   A 120-patient phase II trial of first-line carboplatin and docetaxel (CD) and second-line etoposide and cisplatin (EP) was designed to provide reliable clinical response estimates under a Bayesian probability model with early stopping rules in place for futility and toxicity.  Results:   Seventy-four of 113 (65.4%) and 24 of 71 (33.8%) were progression free after four cycles of CD and EP, respectively. Median overall survival (OS) was 16 months [95% confidence interval (CI), 13.6-19.0 months]. Of the seven ""anaplastic"" criteria, bulky tumor mass was significantly associated with poor outcome. Lactic acid dehydrogenase strongly predicted for OS and rapid progression. Serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) concentration strongly predicted OS but not rapid progression. Neuroendocrine markers did not predict outcome or response to therapy.  Conclusion:   Our findings support the hypothesis that patients with ""anaplastic"" prostate cancer are a recognizable subset characterized by a high response rate of short duration to platinum-containing chemotherapies, similar to SCPC.

A level of PSA 〉 4.0ng/m as a cut-off point or abnormal digital rectal examination (DRE) are used to indicate a prostate biopsy. Nevertheless, non-malignant pathologies can increase serum PSA level so that 70% of biopsies are negative for cancer, and thus potentially unnecessary, causing anxiety, costly clinical tests and prolonged follow-up. Thus the search for new biomarkers is important. Circulating primary prostate cells (CPCs) may be such a marker. We analyze a cohort of patients using CPCs to detect prostate cancer in men with a serum PSA 〉4.0ng/ml or abnormal DRE in terms of cost-benefit.  Methods:   A cohort of 263 patients with a PSA 〉4.0 ng/ml and a test to detect CPCs who underwent prostate biopsy were analyzed. The results of both tests were compared with biopsy results; sensibility, specificity, and predictive values were calculated. Costs of each test, process, drug costs and complications were determined as well as indirect costs.  Results:   Of the 263 patients, 77 (28.6%) had prostate cancer detected, for the test using CPCs there was a sensibility of 85.7%, specificity of 90.3% and negative predictive value of 93.9%. Thus men CPC negative may not need a prostate biopsy. Potential savings for the 263 patients were between €32,068 in a public health service and €69,253 for inpatient private health insurance patients. Follow up cost were higher in false-positive CPC patients but, as there were fewer false positive patients, total costs were lower.  Conclusions:   The use of primary CPC detection as a complementary test in men with a serum PSA 〉4.0ng/ml to indicate prostate biopsy is a specific, cost effective test, eliminating approximately 70% of prostate biopsies. This results in a significant health care saving both in direct and indirect costs, in the costs of complications. Implementation costs were minimal as equipment and reagents are part of the routine clinical laboratory.

Androgen ablation therapy (hormone therapy) has been shown to be effective for advanced prostate cancer. However, continuous hormone therapy often causes recurrence. This results from the progression of androgen-dependent cancer cells to androgen-independent cancer cells during the continuous hormone therapy. One possible method to prevent the progression to the androgen-independent state is intermittent androgen suppression (IAS) therapy, which ceases dosing intermittently. In this paper, we propose two methods to estimate the dynamics of prostate cancer, and investigate the IAS therapy from the viewpoint of optimality. The two methods that we propose for dynamics estimation are a variational Bayesian method for a piecewise affine (PWA) system and a Gaussian process regression method. We apply the proposed methods to real clinical data and compare their predictive performances. Then, using the estimated dynamics of prostate cancer, we observe how prostate cancer behaves for various dosing schedules. It can be seen that the conventional IAS therapy is a way of imposing high cost for dosing while keeping the prostate cancer in a safe state. We would like to dedicate this paper to the memory of Professor Luigi M.

Material and method:   From the prospective completion of the data base of our department, we analyzed 1012 patients operated on between 1986 and December 2009. Patients with neo- or adjuvant treatment and those with pre-operative PSA over 50 were excluded. The sample was divided into three groups: younger than 60, 60 to 69 and over 70. The clinical, pathological variables, biochemical course and need for rescue treatment were analyzed. We consider biochemical relapse as when the PSA values reached values greater than 0.4 in two consecutive measurements. Rescue was defined as the need for hormone treatment or radiotherapy. We then made a comparative study, a univariate survival analysis by Kaplan and Meyer Curves and multivariate by Cox's regression.  Results:   The median follow-up was 55.1 months. Of the 1012 patients included in the study, 317 patients (31.3%) had biochemical progression and 259 (25.6%) required rescue treatment. We observed that the groups with the older age had a significantly higher PSA and higher stages than the rest. No differences were observed in the Gleason score of the surgical specimen or in the state of the surgical margins. Biochemical relapse free survival at 5 years was 72.3% (CI 66.4-78.2) in patients under 60 years, 65.3% (CI 60.6-70.0) for patients under 70 and 62.2% (CI 53.2-71.1) for patients of 70 years or older; P<.05. In the univariate study, age was a factor that was significantly associated to biochemical relapse. However, it loses interest in the multivariate study and PSA, pathological state and Gleason score regain interest. Rescue treatment free survival did not differ by age groups.  Conclusions:   In the current study, worse biochemical evolution of patients over 70 was observed. However, this worse biochemical course was conditioned by clinically more aggressive tumors that, in our opinion, justifies the decision made in regards to the surgical approach taken with these patients.""","""['M Ramírez-Backhaus', 'J Rubio-Briones', 'A Collado', 'J Casanova', 'A Gómez-Ferrer', 'J Domínguez', 'J V Ricos', 'J L Monros', 'I Iborra', 'E Solsona']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Actas Urol Esp""","""['Impact of positive surgical margins on prostate-specific antigen failure after radical prostatectomy in adjuvant treatment-naïve patients.', 'Radical prostatectomy and positive surgical margins: relationship with prostate cancer outcome.', 'External beam radiotherapy versus radical prostatectomy for clinical stage T1-2 prostate cancer: therapeutic implications of stratification by pretreatment PSA levels and biopsy Gleason scores.', 'No difference in six-year biochemical failure rates with or without pelvic lymph node dissection during radical prostatectomy in low-risk patients with localized prostate cancer.', 'Long-term oncological outcomes after laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.', 'Is age an independent risk factor for medical complications following minimally invasive radical prostatectomy?

Materials and methods:   We performed a retrospective cohort study of 197 patients treated with salvage radiotherapy in the setting of detectable relapsed prostate specific antigen 1.0 ng/ml or less. Patients were excluded from analysis if they had lymph node involvement or received androgen deprivation therapy. Freedom from prostate specific antigen progression after salvage radiotherapy was analyzed by a Cox regression model.  Results:   Median relapsed prostate specific antigen was 0.33 ng/ml (range 0.07 to 1.0). There was 86% freedom from prostate specific antigen progression at a median followup of 52 months. Relapsed prostate specific antigen (HR 1.9, p = 0.004), Gleason score 8-10 (HR 5.2, p <0.001) and negative margin status (HR 2.0, p = 0.02) were independently associated with an increased risk of prostate specific antigen progression after salvage radiotherapy. We identified interaction between relapsed prostate specific antigen and Gleason score (p = 0.04) but not margin status. A significant association was noted between higher relapsed prostate specific antigen and prostate specific antigen progression after salvage radiotherapy in patients with Gleason score 8-10 but not 7 or less. In patients with Gleason score 8-10 the rate of freedom from prostate specific antigen progression at 53 months was 77% vs 26% when salvage radiotherapy was initiated at a relapsed prostate specific antigen of 0.33 or less vs 0.34 to 1.0 ng/ml (log rank p = 0.003).  Conclusions:   Different relapsed prostate specific antigen thresholds for unsuccessful salvage radiotherapy may exist based on Gleason score. These data suggest that patients with Gleason score 8-10 should be offered salvage radiotherapy at the earliest detectable relapsed prostate specific antigen, even 0.33 ng/ml or less. Those with Gleason score 7 or less may have the opportunity to be followed with serial prostate specific antigen measurements to improve risk stratification, and delay and/or avoid the potential toxicity of salvage radiotherapy.""","""['Jeremy D Karlin', 'Bridget F Koontz', 'Stephen J Freedland', 'Judd W Moul', 'Baruch M Grob', 'Wen Wan', 'Michael P Hagan', 'Mitchell S Anscher', 'Drew Moghanaki']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Impact of positive surgical margins on prostate-specific antigen failure after radical prostatectomy in adjuvant treatment-naïve patients.', 'Long-term outcomes after high-dose postprostatectomy salvage radiation treatment.', 'Salvage radiotherapy for isolated prostate specific antigen increase after radical prostatectomy: evaluation of prognostic factors and creation of a prognostic scoring system.', 'Early salvage radiotherapy following radical prostatectomy.', 'Use of androgen deprivation and salvage radiation therapy for patients with prostate cancer and biochemical recurrence after prostatectomy.', 'Drug development for noncastrate prostate cancer in a changed therapeutic landscape.', 'Factors influencing biochemical recurrence in patients who have received salvage radiotherapy after radical prostatectomy: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Salvage radiotherapy after radical prostatectomy: prediction of biochemical outcomes.', 'Current approaches, challenges and future directions for monitoring treatment response in prostate cancer.']"""

We previously showed that anti-FACBC is transported by amino acid transporters, especially by alanine-serine-cysteine transporter 2 (ASCT2), which is associated with tumor growth. We studied this affinity to assess the mechanism of anti-FACBC transport in prostate cancer cells.  Methods:   Kinetic assays for trans-1-amino-3-fluoro-[1-(14)C]cyclobutanecarboxylic acid ([(14)C]FACBC) were performed in Xenopus laevis oocytes over-expressing either ASCT2 or sodium-coupled neutral amino acid transporter 2 (SNAT2), both of which are highly expressed in prostate cancer cells. We also examined the kinetics of [(14)C]FACBC uptake using mammalian cell lines over-expressing system L amino acid transporter 1 or 2 (LAT1 or LAT2). Results: ASCT2 and SNAT2 transported [14C]FACBC with Michaelis–Menten kinetics Km values of 96.7 ± 45.2 μM and 196.5 ± 19.7 μM, respectively. [correted].

Methods:   We selected 164 high-risk patients from the trial population of 266 T1-T4N0M0 patients, randomized between rectangular (n=79) and conformal fields (n=85).

Method:   Using the planning CT and pre-treatment CBCTs from the first week of radiotherapy, four adaptive plans of different sizes were derived for each of eight post-prostatectomy patients. Four ROs collectively defined the reference answer, i.e. the plan of the day and isocentre correction for 40 CBCTs taken in weeks 2-6 of treatment for each patient. RTTs were randomly assigned five of these CBCTs; and asked to record their plan of the day selection and isocentre correction. RTT selection and reference answers were compared. The distance between the RTT selection and the reference answer was calculated.  Results:   A total of 33 RTTs took part in this study. The average difference in CTV volume (reference answer-RTT selection) was 1.32 cm(3) (SD 29 cm(3)) overall. The average difference between reference answer and RTT isocentre coordinates was SI 1mm (SD 4.8mm), LR 1.1mm (SD 4.0mm) and AP -0.2mm (SD 3.9 mm).

However, the mechanisms whereby ROS and the antioxidant system participate in cancer progression remain unclear. In order to clarify the influence of oxidative stress in prostate cancer progression, we performed this study in two human prostate cancer cell lines, PC3 and HPV10 (from metastasis and from localized cancer, respectively) and RWPE1 cells derived from normal prostate epithelium. Cells were treated with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and PC3 cells were also treated with diethyl maleate (DEM). The effect on cell growth, viability, mitochondria membrane potential and oxidative stress was analysed. Oxidative stress was evaluated based on ROS production, oxidative lesion of lipids (MDA) and on determination of antioxidants, including enzyme activity of glutathione peroxidase (Gl-Px), glutathione reductase (Gl-Red) and on the quantification of glutathione (GSH), glutathione-s-transferase (GST) and total antioxidant status (TAS). PC3 shows higher ROS production but also the highest GSH levels and Gl-Red activity, possibly contributing to oxidative stress resistance.

We further show that the delayed degradation is due to a delay in EGFR trafficking from early to late endosomes and not to a decrease in EGFR ubiquitination. Finally, we show that depletion of SGEF significantly inhibits epidermal growth factor-induced EGFR signaling cascade and cell migration in the prostate cancer cells.

Recently, several groups have reported on immunohistochemistry (IHC) to measure ERG expression, which is much more readily performed in clinical practice. However, the prior studies examining ERG expression by IHC had small sample sizes or they failed to clarify the association of ERG protein expression with important clinico-pathological features or prostate cancer-specific mortality.  Methods:   To address these deficits, we evaluated ERG expression by IHC in 208 radical prostatectomy samples from the Kaiser Permanente Molecular Epidemiology of Fatal Prostate Cancer (MEFPC) study, a case-control study of prostate cancer-specific mortality.  Results:   Nuclear ERG expression was seen in neoplastic prostate epithelia in 49 of the samples (23.7%).

Taxel-based chemotherapy is the current standard treatment for CRPC patients. Unfortunately, almost all patients eventually develop resistance toward this chemotherapy. Significantly, it was recently found that the anti-tumor effect of paclitaxel in CRPC is due to its inhibition of AR activity via its inhibition of microtubule dynamics. Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1), a critical regulator in many cell cycle events, is elevated in prostate cancer (PCa) and linked to tumor grades. Of note, we have previously shown that Plk1 phosphorylates CLIP-170 and p150(Glued) , two important regulators of microtubule dynamics.  Methods:   We compared paclitaxel-mediated phenotypes (inhibition of the AR signaling, decrease of microtubule dynamics and cell death) of PCa cells expressing different forms of CLIP-170 and p150(Glued) with different Plk1 phosphorylation states.  Results:   We show that Plk1 phosphorylation of CLIP-170 and p150(Glued) affects cellular responses to paclitaxel. Expression of Plk1-unphosphorylatable mutants of CLIP-170 and p150(Glued) results in increased paclitaxel-induced apoptosis, increased protein degradation of the AR, and decreased nuclear accumulation of the AR in response to androgen in prostate cancer cells. Finally, we show that cells expressing unphosphorylatable mutants of CLIP-170 have defective microtubule dynamics, thus providing a new mechanism to understand how Plk1-associated kinase activity promotes constitutive activation of AR signaling in CRPC.

The glucosinolate-derived phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC) has recently been demonstrated to reduce the risk of prostate cancer (PCa) and inhibit PCa cell growth. We previously reported that p300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF), a co-regulator for AR, is upregulated in PCa cells through suppression of the mir-17 gene. Here, we assessed the effects of PEITC on PCAF expression and AR-regulated transcriptional activity in PCa cells.  Methods and results:   Using AR-responsive LNCaP cells, we observed the inhibitory effects of PEITC on the dihydrotestosterone-stimulated AR transcriptional activity and cell growth of PCa cells. Interestingly, overexpression of PCAF attenuated the inhibitory effects of PEITC on dihydrotestosterone-stimulated AR transcriptional activity. Expression of PCAF was upregulated in PCa cells through suppression of miR-17. PEITC treatment significantly decreased PCAF expression and promoted transcription of miR-17 in LNCaP cells. Functional inhibition of miR-17 attenuated the suppression of PCAF in cells treated by PEITC.

We integrated data from Gene Expression Omnibus prostate cancer genes from the Dragon Database of Genes Implicated in Prostate Cancer, and used meta-analysis data to generate a panel of HNF1b-associated prostate cancer risk genes. An RT-PCR was used to assess expression levels in DU145, PC3, LNCaP, and RWEP-1 cells. Twelve genes (BAG1, DDR1, ERBB4, ESR1, HSPD1, IGFBP2, IGFBP5, NR4A1, PAWR, PIK3CG, RAP2A, and TPD52) were found to be associated with both HNF1b and prostate cancer risk. Six of them (BAG1, ERBB4, ESR1, HSPD1, NR4A1, and PIK3CG) were mapped to the KEGG pathway, and submitted to further gene expression assessment. HNF1b, NR4A1, and HSPD1 were found to be highly expressed in the LNCaP androgenic hormone-dependent cell line. Compared to expression levels in wild-type prostate cancer cells, NR4A1, HSPD1, ERBB4, and ESR1 expression levels were also found to be significantly increased in the HNF1b-transfected cells. We conclude that the mechanism of action of HNF1b in prostate cancer involves modulation of the association between androgenic hormone and prostate cancer cells.

Materials and methods:   Between January 2006 and December 2009, a period of 4 years, 72 new patients with prostate cancers were seen of which 43 patients had distant metastases. Only patients with histologic confirmation of prostate cancer and having metastases were included in the study irrespective of age, co-morbidity and performance status. Patients' folders were reviewed retrospectively with a structured pro forma. Information retrieved from patient's folder included age, histology, Gleason score, co-morbidities, interval between diagnosis and referral to oncology unit, interval between referral and presentation at oncology unit, PSA at diagnosis and presentation at oncology unit, sites of metastases, bones sites involved in bone metastases, types of treatment received and follow up status. Results were analysed using Epi Info soft ware Version 3.4.1; 2007 Edition.  Results:   43 patients had distant metastases from prostate cancer during initial evaluation at presentation in the radiotherapy and oncology centre. The mean age was 66.2 years (range, 47-82 years, median age 66 years and modal age group was 65-69 years). Co-morbidity was seen in 18 patients, with hypertension being the commonest (HT=14, DM=2 and HIV 2 patients). No morbidity seen in 25 patients. The range of duration from diagnosis to referral was 1-84 months. Only 20 patients presented at radiotherapy and oncology centre within 6 months of diagnosis and 18 patients presented after 12 months of diagnosis. 33 patients presented within 1 month of being referred for further management. 6 patients reported within 2 months and 2 patients within 3 months and another 2 patients within 4 months. Only 27 patients had PSA done at diagnosis. No PSA was done in 16 patients. The PSA range at diagnosis was 10.0-232 ng/ml, mean PSA was 67.46 ng/ml while only 40 patients did PSA on presentation for further management with a range of 1-245 ng/ml and a mean of 57.95 ng/ml. The histology report revealed adenocarcinoma and transitional carcinoma in 42 and 1 patients respectively. The Gleason score range was 6-10, with a mean score of 7.8. The Gleason score was not reported in 3 patients. Multiple organs involvement by metastases was seen in 16 patients. Bone metastases was the commonest (35), followed by lungs (8), liver (7), Virchow's lymph nodes (6), brain (5), and soft tissue (5). The lumbar vertebrae was the commonest site of bone metastases (32) followed by the sacrum (17), pelvis (11), and long bones (7). 3 patients had metastases to the ribs and 2 patients each to the skull, sternum and cervical spines. All the patients received hormonal therapy, 30 patients received palliative radiotherapy, 29 patients had surgical castration, 25 patients had radical radiotherapy to pelvis, 18 patients had systemic chemotherapy and definitive surgery was done in 16 patients. Only 6 patients received Ibandronate due to cost. 13 patients are alive and attending follow up, 11 confirmed dead and 19 lost to follow up.  Conclusion:   The patients were referred for management late after surgery. Bones, predominately the lumbosacral spines was the commonest organ involved in metastases. Skeletal survey with bone scan and plain x-rays especially lumbosacral spines should be part of the staging investigation for all patients with advanced stage.

It has been well known that the conventional split-focus scheme capable of generating multiple foci can increase a necrotic region in the lateral or elevational direction. To treat a deep-seated target, it is necessary to generate an expanded necrotic region in the axial direction. In this paper, a novel sonication scheme capable of producing an expanded coagulated region in the both lateral and axial directions is presented. The proposed method can generate multi-focal spots in the lateral and axial directions by using a dual concentric-sectored (DCS) HIFU transducer based on phase-shifted ultrasound excitation. A sound field simulation was employed for this investigation. Four electrical signals with identical center frequencies and different phases activated the DCS transducer, composed of a disc and an annular element with a confocal point. Four 4-MHz ultrasound signals with different phases were transmitted to the target simultaneously, resulting in generation of dual-focal spots in the lateral and axial directions. The sound field simulation results showed that the 0-6-dB lateral and axial beamwidths of the DCS transducer were maximally 79% and 91% broader than the single-element transducer. Subsequently, bio-heat transfer and thermal dose simulation results were matched to the sound field simulation. Hence, the DCS HIFU transducer combined with phase-shifted excitation may be a promising approach to treat a deep-seated target and to reduce treatment time for HIFU surgery.""","""['Jong Jeong']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""IEEE Trans Ultrason Ferroelectr Freq Control""","""['Phase-Inverted Multifrequency HIFU Transducer for Lesion Expansion: A Simulation Study.', ""Improved intercostal HIFU ablation using a phased array transducer based on Fermat's spiral and Voronoi tessellation: A numerical evaluation."", 'Adaptive HIFU noise cancellation for simultaneous therapy and imaging using an integrated HIFU/imaging transducer.', 'High-intensity focused ultrasound: principles, therapy guidance, simulations and applications.', 'Treatment with high intensity focused ultrasound: secrets revealed.', 'M-Bonacci Zone Plates for Ultrasound Focusing.']"""

Forty-six patients with oligometastases, defined as five or fewer clinical detectable metastases from any primary site, were treated on a phase I/II trial from February 2007 to September 2010. The majority of patients were treated with 37.5 mg sunitinib (days 1-28) and SBRT 50 Gy (days 8-12 and 15-19) and maintenance sunitinib was used in 39 % of patients. Median follow up for surviving patients is 3.6 years. The 4-year estimates for local control, distant control, progression-free and overall survival were 75 %, 40 %, 34 % and 29 %, respectively. At last follow-up, 26 % of patients were alive without evidence of disease, 7 % were alive with distant metastases, 48 % died from distant metastases, 2 % died from local progression, 13 % died from comorbid illness, and 4 % died from treatment-related toxicities. Patients with kidney and prostate primary tumors were associated with a significantly improved overall survival (hazard ratio = 0.25, p = 0.04).

Our previous mechanistic work shows that inhibition of transcription factor Stat5 by multiple alternative methods induces extensive rapid apoptotic death of Stat5-positive PCa cells in vitro and inhibits PCa xenograft tumor growth in nude mice. Furthermore, STAT5A/B induces invasive behavior of PCa cells in vitro and in vivo, suggesting involvement of STAT5A/B in PCa progression. Nuclear STAT5A/B protein levels are increased in high-grade PCas, CR PCas, and distant metastases, and high nuclear STAT5A/B expression predicts early disease recurrence and PCa-specific death in clinical PCas. Based on these findings, STAT5A/B represents a therapeutic target protein for advanced PCa. The mechanisms underlying increased Stat5 protein levels in PCa are unclear. Herein, we demonstrate amplification at the STAT5A/B gene locus in a significant fraction of clinical PCa specimens. STAT5A/B gene amplification was more frequently found in PCas of high histologic grades and in CR distant metastases.

Patients and methods:   Safety and efficacy data of all 5 Dutch centers participating in the cabazitaxel CUP were collected. Safety data were collected prospectively using the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3.0. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS), time to PSA progression (TTPP), and best clinical response were evaluated retrospectively.  Results:   Fifty-one patients were registered in the CUP; 49 received cabazitaxel. Forty-two of 49 patients [85.7%], 42 patients had ≥ 2 metastatic sites.

Methods:   A total of 1229 patients (median age 66 years) were treated with open sentinel-lymphadenectomy and prostatectomy between 2005 and 2009. Median preoperative prostate-specific antigen was 7.4 ng/mL. The rate of lymph node involvement was analyzed for D'Amico risk groups. Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate the probability of lymph node involvement. Predictor variables included preoperative prostate-specific antigen, clinical T-category and biopsy Gleason sum. Predictive accuracy has been quantified (area under the curve) and lymph node positive patients were verified under consideration of the recommended European threshold for lymphadenectomy (nomogram-predicted lymph node invasion risk of >7%).  Results:   The median number of lymph nodes removed was 10 (interquartile range 7-13). Overall, 17.1% of patients had lymph node involvement; 3.2% in low-, 14.8% in intermediate- and 37.4% in high-risk disease. The predicted risk for lymph node involvement ranged from 2% (prostate-specific antigen ≤4 ng/mL, T1, Gleason sum ≤6) to 87% (prostate-specific antigen >20 ng/mL, T3, Gleason sum ≥8). The predictive accuracy was 82.1%. According to the European guidelines, 15.9% of all lymph node involved cases would not have been detected.  Conclusions:   The rate of lymph node involvement seems to be higher in the examined sentinel collective than expected according to the European Guideline nomogram.

High amounts of omega-6 fatty acids have been linked with increased prostate cancer risk, whereas omega-3 fatty acids have been shown to inhibit PCa growth. However, because omega-3 and omega-6 are both essential fatty acids and part of a complete diet, it is more relevant to determine the ideal ratio of the two that would allow patients to benefit from the therapeutic properties of omega-3 fatty acids. LNCaP prostate cancer cells were treated with dietary-based ratios of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids under hormone-deprivation conditions, and effects on various cellular processes were determined. A low omega-6 to omega-3 PUFA ratio can delay the progression of cells toward castration-resistance by suppressing pathways involved in prostate cancer progression, such as the Akt/mTOR/NFκB axis. It also suppresses the expression of cyclin D1, and activation of caspase-3 and annexin V staining shows induction of proapoptotic events.

MTT and ATP viability assays were used to assess cell growth and flow cytometry to assess cell cycle status. In addition, immunofluorescence was used to detect γH2AX nuclear foci, indicative of DNA damage, and Western blotting to assess the induction of apoptosis and autophagy. The Pd complex showed a powerful growth-inhibitory effect against both cell lines and primary cultures. More importantly, it successfully reduced the viability of cancer stem cells as first reported in this study. The Pd complex induced DNA damage and differentially induced evidence of cell death, as well as autophagy. In conclusion, this novel agent may be promising for use against the bulk of the tumour cell population as well as the prostate cancer stem cells, which are thought to be responsible for the resistance of metastatic prostate cancer to chemotherapy. This study also indicates that the combined use of the Pd complex with an autophagy modulator may be a more promising approach to treat prostate cancer.

By using this novel peptide substrate microarray method we revealed high kinase activity mediated by signal transducer and activator of transcription 5A (STAT5A) in CR prostate cancer. Additionally, we uncovered high STAT5A kinase activity already in regressing ADL xenografts, before renewed CR growth was evidenced. Finally, since increased STAT5A kinase activity also was detected after exposing prostate carcinoma cells to hypoxia, we propose long-term ADT to induce tumor hypoxia and stimulate STAT5A kinase activity, subsequently leading to renewed CR tumor growth. Hence, the study detected STAT5A as a candidate to be further investigated for its potential as marker of advanced prostate cancer and as possible therapeutic target protein.""","""['Kathrine Røe', 'Åse Bratland', 'Ljiljana Vlatkovic', 'Harald Bull Ragnum', 'Marie Grøn Saelen', 'Dag Rune Olsen', 'Laure Marignol', 'Anne Hansen Ree']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Pharmacologic inhibition of Jak2-Stat5 signaling By Jak2 inhibitor AZD1480 potently suppresses growth of both primary and castrate-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Transcription factor signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 promotes growth of human prostate cancer cells in vivo.', 'Autocrine prolactin promotes prostate cancer cell growth via Janus kinase-2-signal transducer and activator of transcription-5a/b signaling pathway.', 'Signal transducer and activator of transcription 5A/B in prostate and breast cancers.', 'Signal transducer and activator of transcription 5a/b: biomarker and therapeutic target in prostate and breast cancer.', 'Kinomic profile in patient-derived glioma cells during hypoxia reveals c-MET-PI3K dependency for adaptation.', 'Prospects for Clinical Development of Stat5 Inhibitor IST5-002: High Transcriptomic Specificity in Prostate Cancer and Low Toxicity In Vivo.', 'Cytokines, JAK-STAT Signaling and Radiation-Induced DNA Repair in Solid Tumors: Novel Opportunities for Radiation Therapy.', 'Large-scale reduction of tyrosine kinase activities in human monocytes stimulated in vitro with N. meningitidis.', 'Expression levels of heat shock protein 27 and cellular FLICE-like inhibitory protein in prostate cancer correlate with Gleason score sum and pathologic stage.']"""

The matriptase-prostasin proteolytic cascade is tightly regulated by hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitor (HAI)-1 such that matriptase autoactivation and prostasin activation occur simultaneously and are followed immediately by the inhibition of both enzymes by HAI-1. However, the mechanisms whereby matriptase acts on extracellular substrates remain elusive. Here we report that some active matriptase can escape HAI-1 inhibition by being rapidly shed from the cell surface. In the pericellular environment, shed active matriptase is able to activate hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), accelerate plasminogen activation, and shed syndecan 1. The amount of active matriptase shed is inversely correlated with the amount of antithrombin (AT) bound to the surface of the keratinocytes. Binding of AT to the surface of keratinocytes is dependent on a functional heparin binding site, Lys-125, and that the N-glycosylation site Asn-135 be unglycosylated. This suggests that β-AT, and not α-AT, is responsible for regulation of pericellular matriptase activity in keratinocytes. Keratinocytes appear to rely on AT to regulate the level of pericellular active matriptase much more than breast and prostate epithelial cells in which AT regulation of matriptase activity occurs at much lower levels than keratinocytes. These results suggest that keratinocytes employ two distinct serine protease inhibitors to control the activation and processing of two different sets of matriptase substrates leading to different biological events: 1) HAI-1 for prostasin activation/inhibition, and 2) AT for the pericellular proteolysis involved in HGF activation, accelerating plasminogen activation, and shedding of syndecans.""","""['Ya-Wen Chen', 'Zhenghong Xu', 'Adrienne N H Baksh', 'Jehng-Kang Wang', 'Chiu-Yuan Chen', 'Richard Swanson', 'Steve T Olson', 'Hiroaki Kataoka', 'Michael D Johnson', 'Chen-Yong Lin']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Regulation of the matriptase-prostasin cell surface proteolytic cascade by hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitor-1 during epidermal differentiation.', 'Targeted deletion of HAI-1 increases prostasin proteolysis but decreases matriptase proteolysis in human keratinocytes.', 'The protease inhibitor HAI-2, but not HAI-1, regulates matriptase activation and shedding through prostasin.', 'The matriptase-prostasin proteolytic cascade in epithelial development and pathology.', 'Roles of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) activator and HGF activator inhibitor in the pericellular activation of HGF/scatter factor.', 'HAI-1 is required for the novel role of FGFBP1 in maintenance of cell morphology and F-actin rearrangement in human keratinocytes.', 'Bone Metastasis Phenotype and Growth Undergo Regulation by Micro-Environment Stimuli: Efficacy of Early Therapy with HGF or TGFβ1-Type I Receptor Blockade.', '3-Cl-AHPC inhibits pro-HGF maturation by inducing matriptase/HAI-1 complex formation.', 'Matriptase shedding is closely coupled with matriptase zymogen activation and requires de novo proteolytic cleavage likely involving its own activity.', 'Matriptase and prostasin are expressed in human skin in an inverse trend over the course of differentiation and are targeted to different regions of the plasma membrane.']"""

With modern conformal techniques for EBRT (three-dimensional conformal RT, intensity-modulated RT, and image-guided RT) and advanced computer-based planning systems for brachytherapy, the dose can be more precisely delivered to the prostate while reducing unnecessary radiation to normal tissue. The dominant intraprostatic tumor can be targeted with a higher dose, so-called dose painting. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging plays a pivotal role in pretreatment assessment of prostate cancer. Multiparametric MR imaging, a combination of anatomic and functional MR imaging techniques (diffusion-weighted imaging, dynamic contrast material-enhanced imaging, and MR spectroscopy), significantly improves the accuracy of tumor localization and local staging. For pretreatment planning, anatomic MR imaging provides highly accurate local staging information, particularly about extraprostatic extension and seminal vesicle invasion. The dominant intraprostatic tumor and local recurrence in the prostatectomy bed can be better localized with multiparametric MR imaging for dose painting.

AR relies on the molecular chaperone HSP90 for its function in both normal and malignant prostate cells, but the requirement for HSP90 in environments with aberrant AR expression is largely unknown. Here, we investigated the efficacy of three HSP90 inhibitors, 17-AAG, HSP990 and AUY922, against clinically-relevant AR missense mutants and truncated variants. HSP90 inhibition effectively suppressed the signaling of wild-type AR and all AR missense mutants tested. By contrast, two truncated AR variants, AR-V7 and ARv567es, exhibited marked resistance to HSP90 inhibitors. Supporting this observation, nuclear localization of the truncated AR variants was not affected by HSP90 inhibition and AR variant:HSP90 complexes could not be detected in prostate cancer cells. Interestingly, HSP90 inhibition resulted in accumulation of AR-V7 and ARv567es in both cell lines and human tumor explants. Despite the apparent independence of AR variants from HSP90 and their treatment-associated induction, the growth of cell lines with endogenous or enforced expression of AR-V7 or ARv567es remained highly sensitive to AUY922.

It is therefore expected that additional exposure to a low level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) will push cancer cells toward death, whereas normal cells might maintain redox homeostasis through adaptive antioxidant responses. We previously showed that parthenolide enhances ROS production in prostate cancer cells through activation of NADPH oxidase. The present study identifies KEAP1 as the downstream redox target that contributes to parthenolide's radiosensitization effect in prostate cancer cells. In vivo, parthenolide increases radiosensitivity of mouse xenograft tumors but protects normal prostate and bladder tissues against radiation-induced injury. Mechanistically, parthenolide increases the level of cellular ROS and causes oxidation of thioredoxin (TrX) in prostate cancer cells, leading to a TrX-dependent increase in a reduced state of KEAP1, which in turn leads to KEAP1-mediated PGAM5 and Bcl-xL (BCL2L1) degradation. In contrast, parthenolide increases oxidation of KEAP1 in normal prostate epithelial cells, leading to increased Nrf2 (NFE2L2) levels and subsequent Nrf2-dependent expression of antioxidant enzymes. These results reveal a novel redox-mediated modification of KEAP1 in controlling the differential effect of parthenolide on tumor and normal cell radiosensitivity.

Given the limited field of view of the surgical site in RALRP, several groups have proposed the integration of transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) imaging in the surgical workflow to assist with accurate resection of the prostate and the sparing of the neurovascular bundles (NVBs). We previously introduced a robotic TRUS manipulator and a method for automatically tracking da Vinci surgical instruments with the TRUS imaging plane, in order to facilitate the integration of intraoperative TRUS in RALRP. Rapid and automatic registration of the kinematic frames of the da Vinci surgical system and the robotic TRUS probe manipulator is a critical component of the instrument tracking system. In this paper, we propose a fully automatic registration technique based on automatic 3-D TRUS localization of robot instrument tips pressed against the air-tissue boundary anterior to the prostate. The detection approach uses a multiscale filtering technique to identify and localize surgical instrument tips in the TRUS volume, and could also be used to detect other surface fiducials in 3-D ultrasound. Experiments have been performed using a tissue phantom and two ex vivo tissue samples to show the feasibility of the proposed methods. Also, an initial in vivo evaluation of the system has been carried out on a live anaesthetized dog with a da Vinci Si surgical system and a target registration error (defined as the root mean square distance of corresponding points after registration) of 2.68 mm has been achieved.

Fruit and vegetable consumption is a novel, non-toxic therapeutic approach that can be used to prevent and treat prostate cancer. Citrus peels and their extracts have been reported to have potent pharmacological activities and health benefits due to the abundance of flavonoids in citrus fruits, particularly in the peels. Our previous studies demonstrated that oral administration of Gold Lotion (GL), an extract of multiple varieties of citrus peels containing abundant flavonoids, including a large percentage of polymethoxyflavones (PMFs), effectively suppressed azoxymethane (AOM)-induced colonic tumorigenesis. However, the efficacy of GL against prostate cancer has not yet been investigated. Here, we explored the anti-tumor effects of GL using a human prostate tumor xenograft mouse model. Our data demonstrated that treatment with GL by both intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection and oral administration dramatically reduced both the weights (57%-100% inhibition) and volumes (78%-94% inhibition) of the tumors without any observed toxicity. These inhibitory effects were accompanied by mechanistic down-regulation of the protein levels of inflammatory enzymes (inducible nitric oxide synthase, iNOS and cyclooxygenase-2, COX-2), metastasis (matrix metallopeptidase-2, MMP-2 and MMP-9), angiogenesis (vascular endothelial growth factor, VEGF), and proliferative molecules, as well as by the induction of apoptosis in prostate tumors.

Over-expression of different MMPs in tumor tissues can disturb the homeostasis and increase the level of various body fluids. Many MMPs including high molecular weights (HMWs) were detected in the urine of prostate and bladder cancer patients. Our aim here is to assess the usefulness of HMW MMPs as non invasive biomarkers in bilharzial bladder cancer in Egyptian patients.  Methods:   The activity of different MMPs including HMW species was determined using zymographic analysis technique in the urine samples procured from sixty six bladder cancer patients (bilharzial and non-bilharzial) as well as hundred healthy control subjects. Also, the correlation between these HMW MMPs activities and different clinico-pathological parameters was investigated.  Results:   High frequency of urine MMPs (uMMPs) activity was determined in 63.6% of examined tumor cases, however, none of the control cases showed any uMMPs activity. MMP-9 had the highest activity (62%) followed by MMP9/NGAL (60%), MMP-2 (54.5%), MMP-9 dimer (53%), ADAMTS (25.6%), and the lowest one was MMP-9/TIMP-1 (12%) only. There was no correlation between uMMPs and any of clinico-pathological parameters including age, gender, tumor size and type, bilharziasis, grade, lymph node involvement, and invasion to the prostate. A significant correlation was established only between MMP-9/TIMP-1 activities with the tumor size.

Methods:   Serum calcium and sex steroid hormones were measured for 1262 men in NHANES III. We calculated multivariable-adjusted geometric means of serum concentrations of total and estimated free testosterone and estradiol, androstanediol glucuronide (AAG), and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) by categories of calcium (lowest 5% [<1.16 mmol/L], mid 90%, top 5% [≥1.30 mmol/L]).

Here, we provide compelling evidence that BMI1 polycomb group protein and a stem cell factor plays a crucial role in determining the fate of tumors vis-à-vis chemotherapy. We show that progressive increase in the levels of BMI1 occurs during the progression of CaP disease in humans. We show that BMI1-rich tumor cells are non-responsive to chemotherapy whereas BMI1-silenced tumor cells are responsive to therapy. By employing microarray, ChIP, immunoblot and Luciferase reporter assays, we identified a unique mechanism through which BMI1 rescues tumor cells from chemotherapy. We found that BMI1 regulates (i) activity of TCF4 transcriptional factor and (ii) binding of TCF4 to the promoter region of anti-apoptotic BCL2 gene. Notably, an increased TCF4 occupancy on BCL2 gene was observed in prostatic tissues exhibiting high BMI1 levels. Using tumor cells other than CaP, we also showed that regulation of TCF4-mediated BCL2 by BMI1 is universal. It is noteworthy that forced expression of BMI1 was observed to drive normal cells to hyperproliferative mode. We show that targeting BMI1 improves the outcome of docetaxel therapy in animal models bearing chemoresistant prostatic tumors.

An alternative to continuous ADT is intermittent ADT (IADT), which allows recovery of testosterone during off-cycles to stimulate regrowth and differentiation of the regressed prostate tumor. IADT offers patients a reduction in side effects associated with ADT, improved quality of life, and reduced cost with no difference in overall survival. Our previous studies showed that IADT coupled with 5α-reductase inhibitor (5ARI), which blocks testosterone conversion to DHT could prolong survival of animals bearing androgen-sensitive prostate tumors when off-cycle duration was fixed. To further investigate this clinically relevant observation, we measured the time course of testosterone-induced regrowth of regressed LuCaP35 and LNCaP xenograft tumors in the presence or absence of a 5ARI. 5α-Reductase inhibitors suppressed the initial regrowth of regressed prostate tumors. However, tumors resumed growth and were no longer responsive to 5α-reductase inhibition several days after testosterone replacement. This finding was substantiated by bromodeoxyuridine and Ki67 staining of LuCaP35 tumors, which showed inhibition of prostate tumor cell proliferation by 5ARI on day 2, but not day 14, after testosterone replacement. 5α-Reductase inhibitors also suppressed testosterone-stimulated proliferation of LNCaP cells precultured in androgen-free media, suggesting that blocking testosterone conversion to DHT can inhibit prostate tumor cell proliferation via an intracrine mechanism. These results suggest that short off-cycle coupled with 5α-reductase inhibition could maximize suppression of prostate tumor growth and, thus, improve potential survival benefit achieved in combination with IADT.""","""['Khalid Z Masoodi', 'Raquel Ramos Garcia', 'Laura E Pascal', 'Yujuan Wang', 'Hei M Ma', ""Katherine O'Malley"", 'Kurtis Eisermann', 'Daniel H Shevrin', 'Holly M Nguyen', 'Robert L Vessella', 'Joel B Nelson', 'Rahul A Parikh', 'Zhou Wang']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Endocrinology""","""['5α-Reductase inhibition coupled with short off cycles increases survival in the LNCaP xenograft prostate tumor model on intermittent androgen deprivation therapy.', 'Inhibition of 5alpha-reductase enhances testosterone-induced expression of U19/Eaf2 tumor suppressor during the regrowth of LNCaP xenograft tumor in nude mice.', 'Growth of LAPC4 prostate cancer xenograft tumor is insensitive to 5α-reductase inhibitor dutasteride.', 'The rationale for inhibiting 5alpha-reductase isoenzymes in the prevention and treatment of prostate cancer.', 'Role of 5α-reductase inhibitors in prostate cancer prevention and treatment.', 'Prostate cancer patients can benefit from 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor treatment: a meta-analysis.', 'Inhibition of Androgen Receptor Function and Level in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Cells by 2-(isoxazol-4-ylmethyl)thio-1-(4-phenylpiperazin-1-yl)ethanone.', 'Inhibition of Androgen Receptor Nuclear Localization and Castration-Resistant Prostate Tumor Growth by Pyrroloimidazole-based Small Molecules.', 'Splicing Factor Prp8 Interacts With NES(AR) and Regulates Androgen Receptor in Prostate Cancer Cells.', '5α-Reductase inhibition coupled with short off cycles increases survival in the LNCaP xenograft prostate tumor model on intermittent androgen deprivation therapy.']"""

Recently, cancer incidence in smaller geographic regions such as counties, and local policy makers are increasingly interested with Federal Information Processing Standard code regions. The natural extension is to directly apply the JPM to county-level cancer incidence data. The direct application has several drawbacks and its performance has not been evaluated. To address the concerns, we developed a spatial random-effects JPM for county-level cancer incidence data. The proposed model was used to predict both cancer incidence rates and counts at the county level. The standard JPM and the proposed method were compared through a validation study.

Participants:   We used the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End-Results (SEER)-Medicare database to identify 84,036 men with prostate cancer initiating ADT from 1996 through 2008.  Main measures:   Rates of BMD testing within the period 12 months prior to 3 months after initiation of ADT were assessed and compared to matched controls without cancer and to men with prostate cancer not receiving ADT. A logistic regression model was performed predicting use of BMD testing, adjusted for patient demographics, indications for ADT use, year of diagnosis and specialty of the physician involved in the care of the patient.  Key results:   Rates of BMD testing increased steadily over time in men receiving ADT, diverging from the control groups such that by 2008, 11.5 % of men were receiving BMD testing versus 4.4 % in men with prostate cancer not on ADT and 3.8 % in the non-cancer controls. In the logistic regression model, year of diagnosis, race/ethnicity, indications for ADT use and geographic region were significant predictors of BMD testing. Patients with only a urologist involved in their care were significantly less likely to receive BMD testing as compared to those with both a urologist and a primary care physician (PCP) (odds ratio 0.71, 95 % confidence interval 0.64-0.80).

Patients were subdivided into four groups according to their PSA level: 1.0 < PSA ≤ 2.0 ng/ml (11 patients), 2.0 < PSA ≤ 4.0 ng/ml (16 patients), 4.0 < PSA ≤ 6.0 ng/ml (9 patients) and PSA > 6.0 ng/ml (10 patients). Correlation between ADT and PDR was investigated as well as between PSA and distribution of metastatic spread.  Results:   The overall PDR of ¹⁸F-CH PET/CT was 80.4% (37/46 patients), increasing with the increase of trigger PSA. PDR of ¹⁸F-CH PET/CT is not influenced by ADT (p = 0.710) even if PET performed under ADT demonstrated an overall higher PDR (82.6%). The majority of the patients (59%, 22/37 patients) showed local relapse only, confined to the prostatic bed; 22% of the PET/CT-positive patients (8/37 patients) showed distant relapse only (bone localizations in all of them), while the remaining 19% (7/37 patients) showed both local and distant (lymph node and bone) spread.  Conclusion:   ¹⁸F-CH PET/CT showed a high overall detection rate (80%), proportional to the trigger PSA (both for local and distant relapse) not influenced by ADT. ¹⁸F-CH PET/CT is proposed as a first-line imaging procedure in restaging prostate cancer patients primarily treated with radiotherapy.""","""['Sotirios Chondrogiannis', 'Maria Cristina Marzola', 'Alice Ferretti', 'Anna Margherita Maffione', 'Lucia Rampin', 'Gaia Grassetto', 'Cristina Nanni', 'Patrick M Colletti', 'Domenico Rubello']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging""","""['Is the detection rate of 18F-choline PET/CT influenced by androgen-deprivation therapy?', 'Is there a role for ¹¹C-choline PET/CT in the early detection of metastatic disease in surgically treated prostate cancer patients with a mild PSA increase <1.5 ng/ml?', 'Clinical utility of (18)F-fluorocholine positron-emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) in biochemical relapse of prostate cancer after radical treatment: results of a multicentre study.', 'The role of choline positron emission tomography/computed tomography in the management of patients with prostate-specific antigen progression after radical treatment of prostate cancer.', '11C-choline PET/CT and PSA kinetics.', 'Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-based imaging in localized and advanced prostate cancer: a narrative review.', 'F-18 fluorocholine positron emission tomography- computed tomography in initial staging and recurrence evaluation of prostate carcinoma: A prospective comparative study with diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging and whole-body skeletal scintigraphy.', 'Diagnostic performance of 18F-choline PET-CT in prostate cancer.', 'Trigger pSA predicting recurrence from positive choline PET/CT with prostate cancer after initial treatment.', 'Predictive factors of 18F-choline PET/CT positivity in patients with prostate cancer recurrence after radiation therapy: is the impact of PSA nadir underestimated?']"""

Previously, we identified GADD153 as a target of BRCA1 protein, which increases doxorubicin sensitivity in human p53 -/- PCa cells (PC3). Considering that p53 is a crucial target in cancer therapy, in this work we investigated p53 role in the regulation of transcription of GADD153.  Methods:   We performed reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), western blot and luciferase assays to analyze GADD153 and/or BRCA1 expression in response to ultraviolet or doxorubicin exposure in PC3 p53 stable-transfected cells and LNCaP (p53+/+) cells. BRCA1 protein recruitment to GADD153 promoter was studied by chromatin immunoprecipitation-qPCR. To assess expression of BRCA1 and/or p53 target genes, we used a panel of stable-transfected PCa cell lines. We finally analyzed these genes in vivo using BRCA1-depleted PCa xenograft models.  Results:   We found that GADD153 was highly induced by doxorubicin in PC3 cells; however, this response was totally abolished in LNCaP (p53wt) and in p53-restituted PC3 cells. Furthermore, BRCA1 protein associates to GADD153 promoter after DNA damage in the presence of p53. Additionally, we demonstrated that BRCA1 and/or p53 modulate genes involved in DNA damage and cell cycle regulation (cyclin D1, BLM, BRCA2, DDB2, p21(WAF1/CIP1), H3F3B, GADD153, GADD45A, FEN1, CCNB2), EMT (E-cadherin, β-catenin, vimentin, fibronectin, slug, snail) and Hedgehog pathways (SHH, IHH, DHH, Gli1, PATCH1). Furthermore, xenograft studies demonstrated that BRCA1 knockdown in PC3 cells increased tumor growth and modulated these genes in vivo.  Conclusions:   Although BRCA1 induces GADD153 in a p53 independent manner, p53 abolished GADD153 induction in response to DNA damage. In addition, several important PCa targets are modulated by BRCA1 and p53. Altogether, these data might be important to understand the therapy response of PCa patients.""","""['P De Luca', 'C P Moiola', 'F Zalazar', 'K Gardner', 'E S Vazquez', 'A De Siervi']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['BRCA1 loss induces GADD153-mediated doxorubicin resistance in prostate cancer.', 'Bim directly antagonizes Bcl-xl in doxorubicin-induced prostate cancer cell apoptosis independently of p53.', 'DNA damage induces BRCA1 distribution alteration in prostate cancer cell lines.', 'Involvement of the multiple tumor suppressor genes and 12-lipoxygenase in human prostate cancer.

However, it is unknown whether AOe specifically increases the risk of lethal PCa. The objective of this study was to determine the association between AOe and the risk of detecting high-grade PCa (HGPCa) (Gleason score ≥7) on biopsy in a US Veteran cohort.  Methods:   Risk factors included clinicodemographic and laboratory data from veterans who were referred for an initial prostate biopsy. Outcomes were defined as the presence versus the absence of PCa, HGPCa, or low-grade PCa (LGPCa) (Gleason score ≤6) in biopsy specimens. Risk among AOe veterans relative to unexposed veterans was estimated using multivariate logistic regression. Separate models were used to determine whether AOe was associated with an increased risk of PCa, HGPCa, or LGPCa.  Results:   Of 2720 veterans who underwent biopsy, PCa was diagnosed in 896 veterans (32.9%), and 459 veterans (16.9%) had HGPCa. AOe was associated with a 52% increase in the overall risk of detecting PCa (adjusted odds ratio, 1.52; 95% confidence interval, 1.07-2.13). AOe did not confer an increase in the risk of LGPCa (adjusted odds ratio, 1.24; 95% confidence interval, 0.81-1.91), although a 75% increase in the risk of HGPCa was observed (adjusted odds ratio, 1.75; 95% confidence interval, 1.12-2.74). AOe was associated with a 2.1-fold increase (95% confidence interval, 1.22-3.62; P < .01) in the risk of detecting PCa with a Gleason score ≥8.  Conclusions:   The current results indicated that an increased risk of PCa associated with AOe is driven by an increased risk of HGPCa in men who undergo an initial prostate biopsy.

Summary answer:   Mild analgesics induce multiple endocrine disturbances in the human adult testis in vitro.  What is known already:   Mild analgesics have recently been incriminated as potential endocrine disruptors. Studies of the effects of these widely used molecules on the androgenic status of men are limited and somewhat contradictory. This prompted us to investigate whether these compounds could alter the adult human testicular function. We therefore assessed in parallel the effects of paracetamol, aspirin and indomethacin on organo-cultured adult human testis and on the NCI-H295R steroid-producing human cell line.  Study design, size, duration:   Adult human testis explants or NCI-H295R adrenocortical human cells were cultured with 10(-4) or 10(-5) M paracetamol, aspirin or indomethacin for 24-48 h. The effect of 10(-5) M ketoconazole, used as an anti-androgenic reference molecule, was also assessed.  Participants/materials, setting, methods:   Testes were obtained from prostate cancer patients, who had not received any hormone therapy. The protocol was approved by the local ethics committee of Rennes, France and informed consent was given by the donors. Only testes displaying spermatogenesis, as assessed by transillumination, were used in this study. Hormone levels in the culture media were determined by radioimmunoassay (testosterone, insulin-like factor 3), Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (inhibin B) or Enzyme Immunosorbent Assay [prostaglandin (PG) D2, and PGE2]. Tissues were observed and cells counted using classical immunohistochemical methods.  Main results and the role of chance:   The three mild analgesics caused multiple endocrine disturbances in the adult human testis. This was particularly apparent in the interstitial compartment. Effective doses were in the same range as those measured in blood plasma following standard analgesic treatment. The production of testosterone and insulin-like factor 3 by Leydig cells was altered by exposure to all these drugs. Inhibin B production by Sertoli cells was marginally affected by aspirin only. Our experiments also revealed that mild analgesics display direct anti-PG activity, which varied depending on the drug used, the dose and the duration of exposure. Nevertheless, associations between the alteration of the PG and testosterone profiles were not systematically observed, suggesting that a combination of mechanisms of endocrine disruption is at play.  Limitations, reasons for caution:   Our studies were performed in vitro.  Wider implications of the findings:   We provide the first evidence that direct exposure to mild analgesics can result in multiple endocrine disturbances in the human adult testis. Caution, concerning the consumption of mild analgesics by men, should be strengthened, particularly in high-risk population subgroups such as elite athletes.""","""['O Albert', 'C Desdoits-Lethimonier', 'L Lesné', 'A Legrand', 'F Guillé', 'K Bensalah', 'N Dejucq-Rainsford', 'B Jégou']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Hum Reprod""","""['Paracetamol, aspirin, and indomethacin induce endocrine disturbances in the human fetal testis capable of interfering with testicular descent.', 'Paracetamol (acetaminophen), aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) and indomethacin are anti-androgenic in the rat foetal testis.', 'Parallel assessment of the effects of bisphenol A and several of its analogs on the adult human testis.', 'Human testicular insulin-like factor 3: in relation to development, reproductive hormones and andrological disorders.', 'Analgesia use during pregnancy and risk of cryptorchidism: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Dysregulation of Immature Sertoli Cell Functions by Exposure to Acetaminophen and Genistein in Rodent Cell Models.', 'The Role of Vitamin E in Protecting against Oxidative Stress, Inflammation, and the Neurotoxic Effects of Acute Paracetamol in Pregnant Female Rats.', 'Contaminants of Emerging Concern (CECs) and Male Reproductive Health: Challenging the Future with a Double-Edged Sword.', 'Potential adverse actions of prenatal exposure of acetaminophen to offspring.', 'Sex-specific neurobehavioral and prefrontal cortex gene expression alterations following developmental acetaminophen exposure in mice.']"""

The PI3K-AKT pathway plays a central role in various cellular processes supporting cell growth and survival of tumor cells. To date, therapeutic approaches to develop inhibitors targeting the PI3K-AKT pathway have failed in both pre-clinical and clinical trials. We showed that a novel AKT inhibitor, AZD5363, inhibits the AKT downstream pathway by reducing p-MTOR and p-RPS6KB/p70S6K. We specifically reported that AZD5363 monotherapy induces G2 growth arrest and autophagy, but fails to induce significant apoptosis in PC-3 and DU145 prostate cancer cell lines. Blocking autophagy using pharmacological inhibitors (3-methyladenine, chloroquine and bafilomycin A 1) or genetic inhibitors (siRNA targeting ATG3 and ATG7) enhances cell death induced by AZD5363 in these prostate cancer cells. Importantly, the combination of AZD5363 with chloroquine significantly reduces tumor volume compared with the control group, and compared with either drug alone in prostate tumor xenograft models. Taken together, these data demonstrate that AKT inhibitor AZD5363, synergizes with the lysosomotropic inhibitor of autophagy, chloroquine, to induce apoptosis and delay tumor progression in prostate cancer models that are resistant to monotherapy, with AZD5363 providing a new therapeutic approach potentially translatable to patients.""","""['Francois Lamoureux', 'Amina Zoubeidi']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Autophagy""","""['Blocked autophagy using lysosomotropic agents sensitizes resistant prostate tumor cells to the novel Akt inhibitor AZD5363.', 'Combination AZD5363 with Enzalutamide Significantly Delays Enzalutamide-resistant Prostate Cancer in Preclinical Models.', 'High Efficacy of Combination Therapy Using PI3K/AKT Inhibitors with Androgen Deprivation in Prostate Cancer Preclinical Models.', 'Novel Insights into Autophagy and Prostate Cancer: A Comprehensive Review.', 'The Two-Faced Role of Autophagy in Endometrial Cancer.', 'Modulating Glycolysis to Improve Cancer Therapy.', 'Quantitative LC-MS/MS uncovers the regulatory role of autophagy in immune thrombocytopenia.', 'Targeting autophagy in disease: established and new strategies.', 'Kinesin family member 18B regulates the proliferation and invasion of human prostate cancer cells.', 'Molecular docking identification for the efficacy of some zinc complexes with chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine against main protease of COVID-19.']"""

Methods:   Self-reported survey data from 3,466 registrants with type 2 diabetes from Australia's National Diabetes Services Scheme (NDSS) were analyzed to compare relevant variables between cancer survivors and cancer-free patients.

Results:   Five percent of diabetic women reported a history of breast cancer and 4.2% of men reported a history of prostate cancer. Diabetic patients with a history of breast or prostate cancer were older at time of survey and diabetes diagnosis, less likely to report metformin use (women), and more likely to have two or more comorbidities than their cancer-free peers. More diabetic prostate cancer survivors also reported problems with mobility and performing usual tasks. However, cancer-free diabetic subjects reported a lower diabetes-dependent quality of life than diabetic cancer survivors. There was no association between cancer survivorship and duration of diabetes, indices of glycemic control, obesity, or diabetic complications.

Materials and methods:   A total of 2,495 patients underwent brachytherapy with or without external beam radiation therapy for the diagnosis of prostate cancer between June 1990 and December 2009. Patients who underwent transurethral prostate resection before implantation were excluded from study. Overall 79 patients (3.3%) underwent channel transurethral resection of the prostate due to urinary retention or refractory obstructive urinary symptoms.

Estimates for time to urinary incontinence were determined using the Kaplan-Meier method with comparisons using logistic regression and Cox proportional hazard rates.  Results:   Median followup after implantation was 7.2 years. Median time to first transurethral prostate resection after implantation was 14.8 months.

To standardize risk stratification schemes the NCCN (National Comprehensive Cancer Network®) provides guidelines for the active surveillance option. We determined the effectiveness of expressed prostatic secretion biomarkers for detecting occult risk factors in NCCN active surveillance candidates.  Materials and methods:   Expressed prostatic secretion specimens were obtained before robot-assisted radical prostatectomy. Secretion capacity biomarkers, including total RNA and expressed prostatic secretion specimen volume, were measured by standard techniques. RNA expression biomarkers, including TXNRD1 mRNA, prostate specific antigen mRNA, TMPRSS2:ERG fusion mRNA and PCA3 mRNA, were measured by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction.  Results:   Of the 528 patients from whom expressed prostatic secretions were collected 216 were eligible for active surveillance under NCCN guidelines. Variable selection on logistic regression identified 2 models, including one featuring types III and VI TMPRSS2:ERG variants, and one featuring 2 secretion capacity biomarkers. Of the 2 high performing models the secretion capacity model was most effective for detecting cases in this group that were up-staged or up-staged plus upgraded. It decreased the risk of up-staging in patients with a negative test almost eightfold and decreased the risk of up-staging plus upgrading about fivefold while doubling the prevalence of up-staging in the positive test group.  Conclusions:   Noninvasive expressed prostatic secretion testing may improve patient acceptance of active surveillance by dramatically reducing the presence of occult risk factors among those eligible for active surveillance under NCCN guidelines.""","""['Christopher Whelan', 'Mark Kawachi', 'David D Smith', 'Jennifer Linehan', 'Gail Babilonia', 'Rosa Mejia', 'Timothy Wilson', 'Steven S Smith']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Performance of a single assay for both type III and type VI TMPRSS2:ERG fusions in noninvasive prediction of prostate biopsy outcome.', 'Combining urinary detection of TMPRSS2:ERG and PCA3 with serum PSA to predict diagnosis of prostate cancer.', 'Urine TMPRSS2:ERG fusion transcript stratifies prostate cancer risk in men with elevated serum PSA.', 'The prognostic and predictive value of TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion and ERG protein expression in prostate cancer biopsies.', 'Blood-based and urinary prostate cancer biomarkers: a review and comparison of novel biomarkers for detection and treatment decisions.', 'Active Surveillance in Prostate Cancer: Role of Available Biomarkers in Daily Practice.', 'Expression profile of microRNAs in expressed prostatic secretion of healthy men and patients with IIIA chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome.', 'Presurgical Biomarker Performance in the Detection of Gleason Upgrading in Prostate Cancer.', 'Potential Utility of Novel Biomarkers in Active Surveillance of Low-Risk Prostate Cancer.', 'Role for (11)C-choline PET in active surveillance of prostate cancer.']"""

CaP incidence in India is low, but rising like other countries. The reasons for this racial disparity are uncertain. The foremost reasons that may underlie regional/ethnic differences are genetic polymorphisms, altered hormonal status, socioeconomic status, and obesity. This study aimed at investigating the role of adipocytokines in stimulating the promotion and progression of CaP.  Methods:   A cross-sectional study on histopathologically proven prostate cancer (N=95) and benign prostatic hyperplasia (N=95) patients was undertaken. CaP patients were classified into high-grade (N=62) and low-grade (N=33), and high stage (N=31) and low stage (N=64) groups. The level of body mass index (BMI), waste to hip ratio (WHR), interleukin-6 (IL-6), leptin, and adiponectin were compared between BPH and CaP groups and between grades and stages of prostate cancer.  Results:   The level of BMI was significantly (p<0.001) higher in CaP patients (26.58±4.76) in comparison to BPH (22.15±2.90). Similarly, WHR was significantly (p<0.0001) higher in the CaP patients (1.08±0.37) in comparison to BPH (0.86±0.15). Leptin (BPH: 25.60, CaP: 56.00) and II-6 levels (BPH: 9.90, CaP: 32.30) were significantly higher, but adiponectin was significantly lower in CaP patients as compared to BPH. High grade CaP patients had significantly higher BMI and WHR in comparison to low grade, and WHR was also higher in high stage CaP. Leptin and IL-6 level were higher in high stage and high grade, but adiponectin was low in high stage and high grade groups in comparison to low stage and low grade groups.  Conclusions:   Higher BMI and WHR correlate with prostate cancer independently, suggesting obesity to be a promoter of poor prostate health. Leptin and IL-6 appear to have stimulating effect on prostate cancer cells inducing the promotion and progression of CaP, but adiponectin appears to be protective against prostate cancer.""","""['Reshu Tewari', 'Singh Rajender', 'S M Natu', 'Apul Goel', 'Divakar Dalela', 'M M Goel', 'Pushpa Tondon']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Cytokine""","""['Calculated fast-growing benign prostatic hyperplasia--a risk factor for developing clinical prostate cancer.', 'Obesity, adipokines, and prostate cancer in a prospective population-based study.', 'Serum leptin: a marker of prostate cancer irrespective of obesity.', 'Obesity and prostate cancer: a role for adipokines.', 'Obesity, adipokines, and prostate cancer (review).', 'The Influence of Ambient Temperature on Adipose Tissue Homeostasis, Metabolic Diseases and Cancers.', 'The ambiguous role of obesity in oncology by promoting cancer but boosting antitumor immunotherapy.', 'Circulating adiponectin and leptin and risk of overall and aggressive prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'The Body Weight Alteration and Incidence of Neoplasm in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes: A Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.', 'Appetite-regulating hormones-leptin, adiponectin and ghrelin-and the development of prostate cancer: a systematic review and exploratory meta-analysis.']"""

Objective:   The long-term oncologic and morbidity outcomes of primary HIFU therapy for localized PCa were evaluated in a prospective, single-arm, single-institution cohort study.  Design, setting, and participants:   Participants were patients treated with HIFU for localized PCa from 1997 to 2009. Excluded were patients with local recurrence following radiotherapy. A second HIFU session was systematically performed in patients with biopsy-proven local recurrence.  Intervention:   Whole-gland prostate ablation with transrectal HIFU.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Incontinence was assessed using the Ingelman-Sundberg score, and potency was assessed using the five-item version of the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5) scores. Primary outcomes were survival rates (biochemical-free, cancer-specific, metastasis-free, and overall survival). Secondary outcomes were morbidity rates. Median follow-up was 6.4 yr (range: 0.2-13.9). The Kaplan-Meier method was used to determine survival estimates, and multivariate analysis was used to determine predictive factors of biochemical progression.  Results and limitations:   A total of 1002 patients were included. The median nadir prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was 0.14 ng/ml, with 63% of patients reaching a nadir PSA ≤0.3 ng/ml. Sixty percent of patients received one HIFU session, 38% received two sessions, and 2% received three sessions. The 8-yr biochemical-free survival rates (Phoenix definition) were 76%, 63%, and 57% for low-, intermediate-, and high-risk patients, respectively (p < 0.001). At 10 yr, the PCa-specific survival rate and metastasis-free survival rate (MFSR) were 97% and 94%, respectively. Salvage therapies included external-beam radiation therapy (EBRT) (13.8%), EBRT plus androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) (9.7%), and ADT alone (12.1%). Severe incontinence and bladder outlet obstruction decreased with refinement in the technology, from 6.4% and 34.9% to 3.1% and 5.9%, respectively. Limitations included the fact that the study was a single-arm study without a comparison group, technological improvements, changes in surgical protocol during the study, and the use of ADT to downsize the prostate in 39% of patients.  Conclusions:   HIFU is a potentially effective treatment of localized PCa, with a low PCa-specific mortality rate and a high MFSR at 10 yr as well as acceptable morbidity.""","""['Sebastien Crouzet', 'Jean Yves Chapelon', 'Olivier Rouvière', 'Florence Mege-Lechevallier', 'Marc Colombel', 'Hélène Tonoli-Catez', 'Xavier Martin', 'Albert Gelet']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['High-intensity focused ultrasound for prostate cancer: tempering our enthusiasm.', 'Reply from author re: J.

Methods and materials:   From July 2003 to May 2010, 150 patients with prostate cancer underwent low-dose iodine-125 prostate brachytherapy as a monotherapy by the same medical team (one urologist and one radiation oncologist). Patients were divided into three periods: P1 (n = 64), P2 (n = 45), and P3 (n = 41) according to technical changes: use of an automatic stepper from P2, use of a high-frequency ultrasound probe in P3. Urinary toxicity was analyzed according to the incidence of acute urinary retention (AUR), Delta International Prostate Symptom Score (Δ IPSS) defined as IPPS maximal - IPSS at baseline, and proportion of patients with Δ IPSS ≥5 and IPSS total >15. The Radiation Therapy Oncology Group classification was used to evaluate the rectal morbidity.  Results:   The incidence of AUR (6% overall) decreased significantly with time: 12.5% (8/64) during P1, 2.2% (1/45) in P2, and 0% in P3 (p = 0.014). Mean Δ IPSS (11.6) remained stable during the three periods. Patients with Δ IPSS ≥5 and IPSS total >15 were 58.7%, 58.1%, and 56.1% for P1, P2, and P3 (p = 0.96), respectively. Grade 1 and 2 proctitis were observed in 15.3% and 9.3% of the patients without any significant difference between the three periods.  Conclusion:   The incidence of AUR decreased significantly with time. This was probably because of the experience of the practitioner and the use of an automatic stepper that allowed reducing prostatic traumatism.

We assessed the use of prostate sector analysis based on MRI for quality assurance after (103)Pd monotherapy.  Methods and materials:   Fifty men with intermediate-risk prostate cancer underwent (103)Pd monotherapy in a prospective phase II trial at MD Anderson Cancer Center. Dosimetric analyses on day 30 after the implant were done using both CT and fused CT/MRI scans. Dosimetric variables were assessed for the entire prostate and for each of three or six sectors. Volumes and dosimetric variables were compared with paired t tests.  Results:   Postimplant dosimetric variables for the entire prostate were significantly different on CT vs. CT/MRI (p = 0.019 for V100 and p < 0.01 for D90). Prostate volumes were smaller on the CT/MRI scans (p < 0.00001). The base sector contributed the greatest difference, with doses based on CT/MRI lower than those based on CT (p < 0.01 for V100 and D90). To date, these lower base doses have not affected biochemical outcomes for patients with disease in prostate base biopsy samples.  Conclusions:   CT/MRI is more precise than CT for prostate volume delineation and dosimetric quality assessment and thus provides superior heterogeneity control assessment after (103)Pd monotherapy implants.""","""['Vinita Takiar', 'Thomas J Pugh', 'David Swanson', 'Rajat J Kudchadker', 'Teresa L Bruno', 'Sarah McAvoy', 'Usama Mahmood', 'Steven J Frank']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Brachytherapy""","""['Improving prostate brachytherapy quality assurance with MRI-CT fusion-based sector analysis in a phase II prospective trial of men with intermediate-risk prostate cancer.', 'Effect of prostate size and isotope selection on dosimetric quality following permanent seed implantation.', 'MRI-assisted radiosurgery: A quality assurance nomogram for palladium-103 and iodine-125 prostate brachytherapy.', 'American Brachytherapy Society (ABS) recommendations for transperineal permanent brachytherapy of prostate cancer.', 'Review on the effectiveness of prostate cancer brachytherapy.', 'Fusion of Intraoperative Transrectal Ultrasound Images with Post-implant Computed Tomography and Magnetic Resonance Imaging.', 'Permanent prostate brachytherapy postimplant magnetic resonance imaging dosimetry using positive contrast magnetic resonance imaging markers.', 'Comparison of implant quality between intraoperatively built custom-linked seeds and loose seeds in permanent prostate brachytherapy using sector analysis.', 'Magnetic resonance image guided brachytherapy.']"""

Our report presents a 6-year update from 304 low- (n = 211), intermediate- (n = 81), and high-risk (n = 12) prostate cancer patients who received CyberKnife SBRT.  Methods:   The median PSA at presentation was 5.8 ng/ml. Fifty-seven patients received neoadjuvant hormonal therapy for up to one year. The first 50 patients received a total dose of 35 Gy in 5 fractions of 7 Gy. The subsequent 254 patients received a total dose of 36.25 Gy in 5 fractions of 7.25 Gy. Toxicity was assessed with the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite questionnaire and the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group urinary and rectal toxicity scale. Biochemical failure was assessed using the nadir + 2 definition.  Results:   No patients experienced Grade III or IV acute complications. Fewer than 5% of patients experienced any acute Grade II urinary or rectal toxicities. Late urinary Grade II complications were observed in 4% of patients treated to 35 Gy and 9% of patients treated to 36.25 Gy. Five (2%) late Grade III urinary toxicities occurred in patients who were treated with 36.25 Gy. Late Grade II rectal complications were observed in 2% of patients treated to 35 Gy and 5% of patients treated to 36.25 Gy. Bowel and urinary quality of life (QOL) scores initially decreased, but later returned to baseline values. An overall decrease of 20% in the sexual QOL score was observed. QOL in each domain was not differentially affected by dose. For patients that were potent prior to treatment, 75% stated that they remained sexually potent. Actuarial 5-year biochemical recurrence-free survival was 97% for low-risk, 90.7% for intermediate-risk, and 74.1% for high-risk patients. PSA fell to a median of 0.12 ng/ml at 5 years; dose did not influence median PSA levels.  Conclusions:   In this large series with long-term follow-up, we found excellent biochemical control rates and low and acceptable toxicity, outcomes consistent with those reported for from high dose rate brachytherapy (HDR BT).

Recently, it has been suggested that the p63 isoform p40 might be more specific as a basal cell marker. In this study we compare the staining characteristics of p63 and p40 in normal and malignant prostate tissues.  Methods and results:   A prostatectomy cohort (n = 640) in tissue microarray format was evaluated for p63 (clone 4A4) and for p40 (rabbit polyclonal) immunoreactivity in malignant and normal tissues. Immunoreactivity of basal and secretory cells was evaluated in a semiquantitative manner and compared case-wise. In normal tissues, p40 showed highly similar immunoreactivity compared to p63. The staining patterns were absolutely identical in 88% of cases. Additional cytoplasmic p40 staining in tumour cells occurred in 59.6% of cancer cases. Differences were seen in nuclear staining of carcinomas: 1.4% of carcinomas were p63-positive, whereas 0.6% were p40-positive.  Conclusions:   In most cases, p40 stains prostatic basal cells as reliably as p63, with only minor differences. Aberrant staining of tumour cells is seen more rarely than with p63 (clone 4A4), establishing its higher specificity.

We analyzed the activity of two novel androgen receptor antagonists, (S)-11 and (R)-9, in in vitro and in vivo experimental models of hormone-sensitive or castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). In vitro experiments were performed on LNCaP, LNCaP-AR, LNCaP-Rbic and VCaP human prostate cancer cells. Cytotoxic activity was assessed by SRB and BrdU uptake, AR transactivation by luciferase reporter assay and PSA levels by Real Time RT-PCR and ELISA assays. Cell cycle progression-related markers were evaluated by western blot. In vivo experiments were performed on SCID mice xenografted with cells with different sensitivity to hormonal treatment. In hormone-sensitive LNCaP and LNCaP-AR cells, the latter expressing high androgen receptor levels, (R)-9 and (S)-11 exhibited a higher cytotoxic effect compared to that of the reference compound ((R)-bicalutamide), also in the presence of the synthetic androgen R1881. Furthermore, the cytotoxic effect produced by (R)-9 was higher than that of (S)-11 in the two hormone-resistant LNCaP-AR and VCaP cells. A significant reduction in PSA levels was observed after exposure to both molecules. Moreover, (S)-11 and (R)-9 inhibited DNA synthesis by blocking the androgen-induced increase in cyclin D1 protein levels. In vivo studies on the toxicological profile of (R)-9 did not reveal the presence of adverse events. Furthermore, (R)-9 inhibited tumor growth in various in vivo models, especially LNCaP-Rbic xenografts, representative of recurrent disease.

The cold-inducible RNA-binding protein RBM3 is upregulated in several types of cancer, including prostate cancer, but its pathogenic contributions are undetermined. RBM3 is expressed at low basal levels in human fetal prostate or in CD133(+) prostate epithelial cells (PrEC), compared with the adult prostate or CD133-PrEC, and RBM3 is downregulated in cells cultured in soft agar or exposed to stress. Notably, RBM3 overexpression in prostate cancer cells attenuated their stem cell-like properties in vitro as well as their tumorigenic potential in vivo. Interestingly, either overexpressing RBM3 or culturing cells at 32°C suppressed RNA splicing of the CD44 variant v8-v10 and increased expression of the standard CD44 (CD44s) isoform. Conversely, silencing RBM3 or culturing cells in soft agar (under conditions that enrich for stem cell-like cells) increased the ratio of CD44v8-v10 to CD44s mRNA. Mechanistic investigations showed that elevating CD44v8-v10 interfered with MMP9-mediated cleavage of CD44s and suppressed expression of cyclin D1, whereas siRNA-mediated silencing of CD44v8-v10 impaired the ability of prostate cancer cells to form colonies in soft agar. Together, these findings suggested that RBM3 contributed to stem cell-like character in prostate cancer by inhibiting CD44v8-v10 splicing.

Reciprocal interactions between these 2 types of cells are critical for maintaining prostate homeostasis, whereas aberrant stromal cell proliferation can disrupt this balance and result in diseases such as benign prostatic hyperplasia. Although the androgen and estrogen receptors are relatively well studied for their functions in controlling stromal cell proliferation and differentiation, the role of the progesterone receptor (PR) remains unclear.  Objective:   The aim of the study was to investigate the expression and function of the PR in the prostate.  Design and setting:   Human prostate biopsies, renal capsule xenografts, and prostate stromal cells were used. Immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, real-time quantitative PCR, cell proliferation, flow cytometry, and gene microarray analyses were performed.  Results:   Two PR isoforms, PRA and PRB, are expressed in prostate stromal fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells, but not in epithelial cells. Both PR isoforms suppress prostate stromal cell proliferation through inhibition of the expression of cyclinA, cyclinB, and cdc25c, thus delaying cell cycling through S and M phases. Gene microarray analyses further demonstrated that PRA and PRB regulated different transcriptomes. However, one of the major gene groups commonly regulated by both PR isoforms was the one associated with regulation of cell proliferation.

Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for prostate cancer has been linked with increased cardiovascular risk, but the mechanisms are unclear. Is there evidence that endothelial dysfunction, as evidenced by reduced flow-mediated dilatation (FMD), is associated with ADT? What is the main finding and its importance? Reduction in FMD with preservation of glyceryl trinitrate-mediated dilatation indicates endothelial dysfunction in men with prostate cancer on long-term ADT compared with well-matched control subjects. Vascular endothelial dysfunction associated with long-term ADT for prostate cancer might explain the observed epidemiological increases in adverse cardiovascular events. Assessment of FMD may be useful in the monitoring of cardiovascular risk in men with prostate cancer on ADT. Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in men with prostate cancer has been linked to an increased incidence of cardiovascular events and mortality, but the underpinning mechanisms are unclear. Endothelial dysfunction is considered a precursor for cardiovascular disease. Previous studies have reported variably on the association between ADT and endothelial function. This blinded case-control study examined endothelial function, using high-resolution ultrasound to measure flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) and glyceryl trinitrate (GTN)-mediated-dilatation in the brachial artery, in 20 men with prostate cancer (69 ± 7 years old) treated by ADT (median duration 22 months, range 6-133 months) and 20 men without prostate cancer (69 ± 5 years old) matched for age, physical activity, coexistent cardiovascular disease and body mass index. The magnitude of dilatation was calculated traditionally and allometrically scaled, adjusting for baseline diameter. There were no differences between groups for resting vascular measures (means ± SD). Flow-mediated dilatation was lower in men on ADT than in control subjects (3.9 ± 2.1 versus 5.9 ± 3.8% for traditional, P = 0.047; 3.7 ± 2.7 versus 6.0 ± 2.7% for allometrically scaled, P = 0.023). Response to GTN was similar in both groups (12.2 ± 4.2 versus 14.8 ± 5.7% for traditional, P = 0.113; 12.3 ± 4.6 versus 14.4 ± 4.6% for allometrically scaled, P = 0.163). The magnitude of difference in mean FMD between groups was marginally altered to 2.4% (95% confidence interval 0.3-4.5) after adjustment for the difference in body fat mass and concomitant cardiovascular medication, with the difference in FMD remaining significant (P = 0.029). There is evidence of endothelial dysfunction in men with prostate cancer on long-term ADT.

Thus, the aim of this study is to investigate the expression patterns and the clinical significance of SOCSs in PCa. The expression changes of SOCSs at mRNA and protein levels in human PCa tissues compared with adjacent benign prostate tissues were, respectively, detected by using real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (QRT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry analyses. The associations of SOCSs expression with clinicopathological features and clinical outcome of PCa patients were further statistically analyzed. Among SOCSs, both QRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry analyses found that SOCS2 expression was upregulated (at mRNA level: change ratio = 1.98, P = 0.031; at protein level: 5.12 ± 0.60 vs. 2.68 ± 0.37, P = 0.016) and SOCS6 expression was downregulated (at mRNA level: change ratio = -1.65, P = 0.008; at protein level: 3.03 ± 0.32 vs. 4.0.72 ± 0.39, P = 0.004) in PCa tissues compared with those in non-cancerous prostate tissues. In addition, the upregulation of SOCS2 in PCa tissues was correlated with the lower Gleason score (P < 0.001), the absence of metastasis (P < 0.001) and the negative PSA failure (P = 0.009); the downregulation of SOCS6 tended to be found in PCa tissues with the higher Gleason score (P = 0.016), the advanced pathological stage (P = 0.007), the positive metastasis (P = 0.020), and the positive PSA failure (P = 0.032). Furthermore, both univariate and multivariate analyses showed that the downregulation of SOCS2 was an independent predictor of shorter biochemical recurrence-free survival.

Low contrast images of trans rectal ultrasound and presence of imaging artifacts like speckle, micro-calcifications, and shadow regions hinder computer aided automatic or semi-automatic prostate segmentation.

The model parameters are then modified with the prior knowledge of the optimization space to achieve optimal prostate segmentation. In contrast to traditional statistical models of shape and intensity priors, we use posterior probabilities of the prostate region determined from random forest classification to build our appearance model, initialize and propagate our model. Furthermore, multiple mean models derived from spectral clustering of combined shape and appearance parameters are applied in parallel to improve segmentation accuracies.

Hormone therapy is effective at early stage, but often fails with the eventual development of hormone-refractory tumors. We have been interested in developing therapeutics targeting specific metabolic deficiency of tumor cells. We recently showed that prostate tumor cells specifically lack an enzyme (argininosuccinate synthase, or ASS) involved in the synthesis of the amino acid arginine(1). This condition causes the tumor cells to become dependent on exogenous arginine, and they undergo metabolic stress when free arginine is depleted by arginine deiminase (ADI)(1,10). Indeed, we have shown that human prostate cancer cells CWR22Rv1 are effectively killed by ADI with caspase-independent apoptosis and aggressive autophagy (or macroautophagy)(1,2,3). Autophagy is an evolutionarily-conserved process that allows cells to metabolize unwanted proteins by lysosomal breakdown during nutritional starvation(4,5). Although the essential components of this pathway are well-characterized(6,7,8,9), many aspects of the molecular mechanism are still unclear - in particular, what is the role of autophagy in the death-response of prostate cancer cells after ADI treatment? In order to address this question, we required an experimental method to measure the level and extent of autophagic response in cells - and since there are no known molecular markers that can accurately track this process, we chose to develop an imaging-based approach, using quantitative 3D fluorescence microscopy(11,12). Using CWR22Rv1 cells specifically-labeled with fluorescent probes for autophagosomes and lysosomes, we show that 3D image stacks acquired with either widefield deconvolution microscopy (and later, with super-resolution, structured-illumination microscopy) can clearly capture the early stages of autophagy induction. With commercially available digital image analysis applications, we can readily obtain statistical information about autophagosome and lysosome number, size, distribution, and degree of colocalization from any imaged cell. This information allows us to precisely track the progress of autophagy in living cells and enables our continued investigation into the role of autophagy in cancer chemotherapy.""","""['Chun A Changou', 'Deanna L Wolfson', 'Balpreet Singh Ahluwalia', 'Richard J Bold', 'Hsing-Jien Kung', 'Frank Y S Chuang']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Vis Exp""","""['Arginine deiminase as a novel therapy for prostate cancer induces autophagy and caspase-independent apoptosis.', 'ADI, autophagy and apoptosis: metabolic stress as a therapeutic option for prostate cancer.', 'Arginine starvation-associated atypical cellular death involves mitochondrial dysfunction, nuclear DNA leakage, and chromatin autophagy.', 'Arginine deprivation, autophagy, apoptosis (AAA) for the treatment of melanoma.', 'Targeted cellular metabolism for cancer chemotherapy with recombinant arginine-degrading enzymes.', 'Excess sphingomyelin disturbs ATG9A trafficking and autophagosome closure.', 'Quantitative indices of autophagy activity from minimal models.']"""

In this study we examined the use of a study screener to enhance accrual and highlight bone health issues in a tertiary referral cancer center.  Patients and methods:   A study screener was introduced into 4 separate genitourinary clinics in a tertiary referral cancer center.

If these men had a reduced risk of pathologic progression, particularly grade related, the intensity of their follow-up could be decreased.  Objective:   To investigate if men with no cancer on B2 are less likely to undergo subsequent pathologic progression.  Design, setting, and participants:   Men were identified from our tertiary care center AS prostate cancer database (1995-2012). Eligibility criteria were prostate-specific antigen (PSA) ≤ 10, cT2 or lower, no Gleason grade 4 or 5, three or fewer positive cores, and no core >50% involved. Only patients with three or more biopsies were selected and then dichotomized on cancer status (yes or no) at B2.  Intervention as outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Pathologic progression was defined as grade (advancement in Gleason score) and/or volume (more than three positive cores, >50% core involved). Progression-free survival was compared. Predictors of progression were investigated using a Cox proportional hazards model.  Results and limitations:   Of the 286 patients remaining on AS after B2, 149 (52%) had no cancer and 137 (48%) had cancer. The median follow-up after B2 was 41 mo (interquartile range [IQR]: 26.5-61.9). Progression-free survival at 5 yr was 85.2% versus 67.3% for negative B2 versus cancer on B2, respectively (p = 0.002). Men with no cancer at B2 had a 53% reduction in risk of subsequent progression (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.47; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.29-0.77; p = 0.003). Subanalysis showed prognostic indicators of volume-related progression were absence of cancer (HR: 0.36; 95% CI, 0.20-0.62; p = 0.0006) and PSA density (HR: 1.79; 95% CI, 1.12-2.89; p = 0.01).

The TMPRSS2-ERG fusion is a common chromosomal rearrangement that occurs early in the development of invasive adenocarcinoma of the prostate and results in the expression of a truncated ERG protein. This fusion is present in 50% of adenocarcinomas and in 20% of high-grade prostate intraepithelial lesions. Until recently, fluorescent in situ hybridization was the only method available to detect these rearrangements. A specific anti-ERG antibody is now available for detecting ERG protein expression and serves as a useful marker for ERG rearrangements. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections of adenosis from cases of prostate biopsies (n = 30), transurethral resections of the prostate (n = 12), and radical prostatectomies (n = 3) were analyzed via immunohistochemistry for ERG. None (0%) of the foci of adenosis were positive for ERG protein expression. Of 40 cases of Gleason score 6 adenocarcinoma on a tissue microarray, 22 (55%) were positive for ERG protein. Of the positive cases, 14 (63.6%) were moderate in intensity, with the remaining 36.4% being weak.

These resultant wounds pose a significant problem in terms of morbidity and healthcare spend. Recently, an increasing volume of research has focused on the molecular perturbations underlying non-healing wounds.  Objectives:   This study investigates the effect of a novel cancer promoter, Ehm2, in wound healing. Ehm2 belongs to the FERM family of proteins, known to be involved in membrane-cytoskeletal interactions, and has been shown to promote cancer metastasis in melanoma, prostate cancer and breast cancer.  Methods:   Ehm2 mRNA levels were analysed using qRT-PCR, standardised to GAPDH, from either acute or chronic wounds, and normal skin. IHC analysis was also undertaken from wound edge biopsies. An anti-Ehm2 transgene was created and transfected into the HaCaT cell line. The effect of Ehm2 knockdown on migration, adhesion, growth, cell cycle progression and apoptosis was analysed using standard laboratory methods. Western Blot analysis was used to investigate potential downstream protein interactions.  Results:   Ehm2 is expressed nearly three times higher in acute wound tissues, compared to chronic wound tissues. Increased Ehm2 expression is found in wounds undergoing healing, especially at the leading wound edge. In vitro, Ehm2 knockdown reduces cellular adhesion, migration and motility, without affecting growth, cell cycle and apoptosis. Finally, Ehm2 knockdown results in reduced NWasp protein expression.  Conclusion:   These results suggest Ehm2 may be an important player in the wound healing process, and show that Ehm2 knockdown downregulates the expression of NWasp, through which it may have its effect on cellular migration.""","""['David C Bosanquet', 'Lin Ye', 'Keith G Harding', 'Wen G Jiang']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Dermatol Sci""","""['Clinical implications of the influence of Ehm2 on the aggressiveness of breast cancer cells through regulation of matrix metalloproteinase-9 expression.', 'Increased expression of the metastasis-associated gene Ehm2 in prostate cancer.', 'Expression of WAVEs, the WASP (Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein) family of verprolin homologous proteins in human wound tissues and the biological influence on human keratinocytes.', 'FERM family proteins and their importance in cellular movements and wound healing (review).', 'The modern approach to wound treatment.', 'Overlapping Interstitial Deletions of the Region 9q22.33 to 9q33.3 of Three Patients Allow Pinpointing Candidate Genes for Epilepsy and Cleft Lip and Palate.', 'Identifying key multifunctional components shared by critical cancer and normal liver pathways via SparseGMM.', 'A Genomic Study of Myxomatous Mitral Valve Disease in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels.', 'Inflammation markers in cutaneous melanoma - edgy biomarkers for prognosis.', 'Expression of Hepatocyte Growth Factor-Like Protein in Human Wound Tissue and Its Biological Functionality in Human Keratinocytes.']"""

The aim of this study was to determine which criteria predict late toxicity among various DVH parameters when contouring the entire solid bladder and its contents versus the bladder wall. The area under the histogram curve (AUHC) was also analyzed.  Methods and materials:   From 1993 to 2000, 503 men with prostate cancer received 3-dimensional conformal RT (median follow-up time, 71 months). The whole bladder and the bladder wall were contoured in all patients. The primary endpoint was grade ≥2 genitourinary (GU) toxicity occurring ≥3 months after completion of RT. Cox regressions of time to grade ≥2 toxicity were estimated separately for the entire bladder and bladder wall. Concordance probability estimates (CPE) assessed model discriminative ability. Before training the models, an external random test group of 100 men was set aside for testing. Separate analyses were performed based on the mean age (≤ 68 vs >68 years).  Results:   Age, pretreatment urinary symptoms, mean dose (entire bladder and bladder wall), and AUHC (entire bladder and bladder wall) were significant (P<.05) in multivariable analysis. Overall, bladder wall CPE values were higher than solid bladder values. The AUHC for bladder wall provided the greatest discrimination for late bladder toxicity when compared with alternative DVH points, with CPE values of 0.68 for age ≤68 years and 0.81 for age >68 years.  Conclusion:   The AUHC method based on bladder wall volumes was superior for predicting late GU toxicity. Age >68 years was associated with late grade ≥2 GU toxicity, which suggests that risk-adapted dose constraints based on age should be explored.""","""['Awad A Ahmed', 'Brian Egleston', 'Pino Alcantara', 'Linna Li', 'Alan Pollack', 'Eric M Horwitz', 'Mark K Buyyounouski']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Late toxicity after intensity-modulated radiation therapy for localized prostate cancer: an exploration of dose-volume histogram parameters to limit genitourinary and gastrointestinal toxicity.', 'Volume and hormonal effects for acute side effects of rectum and bladder during conformal radiotherapy for prostate cancer.', 'Role of principal component analysis in predicting toxicity in prostate cancer patients treated with hypofractionated intensity-modulated radiation therapy.', 'Dose-volume analysis of predictors for chronic rectal toxicity after treatment of prostate cancer with adaptive image-guided radiotherapy.', 'A focused review of statistical practices for relating radiation dose-volume exposure and toxicity.', 'Feature Importance Analysis of a Deep Learning Model for Predicting Late Bladder Toxicity Occurrence in Uterine Cervical Cancer Patients.', 'Predicting post-radiation genitourinary hospital admissions in patients with localised prostate cancer.', 'Urinary toxicity after salvage re-irradiation for prostate cancer local failure after definitive radiotherapy: a clinical and dosimetric prognostic factors analysis.', 'Incidence of genitourinary complications following radiation therapy for localised prostate cancer.', 'Development of a prediction model for late urinary incontinence, hematuria, pain and voiding frequency among irradiated prostate cancer patients.']"""

Loss of the Y chromosome is a common chromosomal abnormality observed in the human prostate cancer.  Results:   We screened 51 standard sequence tagged sites (STSs) corresponding to a male-specific region of the Y chromosome (MSY), sequenced the coding region of the SRY gene and assessed the status of the DYZ1 arrays in the human prostate cancer cell lines DU145 and LNCaP. The MSY was found to be intact and coding region of SRY showed no sequence variation in both the cell lines. However, DYZ1 arrays showed sequence and copy number variations. DU145 and LNCaP cells were found to carry 742 and 1945 copies of the DYZ1, respectively per 3.3 pg of genomic DNA. The DYZ1 copies detected in these cell lines are much below the average of that reported in normal human males. Similarly, the number of ""TTCCA"" repeat and its derivatives within the DYZ1 arrays showed variation compared to those of the normal males.  Conclusions:   Clearly, the DYZ1 is maximally affected in both the cell lines. Work on additional cell lines and biopsied samples would augment our understanding about the susceptibility of this region.

However, the mechanisms and signaling pathways that mediate these inhibitory effects are essentially unknown.  Methods:   MCF7 cell line was chosen as a model system to study the mechanisms by which OGR1 regulates cell migration, since it expresses very low levels of endogenous OGR1. Cell migratory activities were assessed using both wound healing and transwell migration assays. The signaling pathways involved were studied using pharmacological inhibitors and genetic forms of the relevant genes, as well as small G protein pull-down activity assays. The expression levels of various signaling molecules were analyzed by Western blot and quantitative PCR analysis.  Results:   Over-expression of OGR1 in MCF7 cells substantially enhanced activation of Rho and inhibition of Rac1, resulting in inhibition of cell migration. In addition, expression of the Gα12/13 specific regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) domain of p115RhoGEF, but not treatment with pertussis toxin (PTX, a Gαi specific inhibitor), could abrogate OGR1-dependent Rho activation, Rac1 inactivation, and inhibition of migration in MCF7 cells. The bioactive lipids tested had no effect on OGR1 function in cell migration.  Conclusion:   Our data suggest, for the first time, that OGR1 inhibits cell migration through a Gα12/13 -Rho-Rac1 signaling pathway in MCF7 cells. This pathway was not significantly affected by bioactive lipids and all the assays were conducted at constant pH, suggesting a constitutive activity of OGR1. This is the first clear delineation of an OGR1-mediated cell signaling pathway involved in migration.""","""['Jing Li', 'Bin Guo', 'Jing Wang', 'Xiaoyan Cheng', 'Yan Xu', 'Jianli Sang']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Mol Signal""","""['Ovarian cancer G protein-coupled receptor 1 inhibits A549 cells migration through casein kinase 2α intronless gene and neutral endopeptidase.', 'Ovarian cancer G protein-coupled receptor 1, a new metastasis suppressor gene in prostate cancer.', 'Effects of ovarian cancer G protein coupled receptor 1 on the proliferation, migration, and adhesion of human ovarian cancer cells.', 'The proton-sensing receptor ovarian cancer G-protein coupled receptor 1 (OGR1) in airway physiology and disease.', 'Molecular actions of ovarian cancer G protein-coupled receptor 1 caused by extracellular acidification in bone.', 'The impact of tumour pH on cancer progression: strategies for clinical intervention.', 'Cell-Type-Specific Effects of the Ovarian Cancer G-Protein Coupled Receptor (OGR1) on Inflammation and Fibrosis; Potential Implications for Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis.', 'Ogerin mediated inhibition of TGF-β(1) induced myofibroblast differentiation is potentiated by acidic pH.', 'Expression of GPR68, an Acid-Sensing Orphan G Protein-Coupled Receptor, in Breast Cancer.', 'pH and proton-sensitive receptors in brain ischemia.']"""

We then observed that BMP-7 inhibited cell proliferation of both cell lines in a protein concentration dependent manner in vitro. Additionally, when BMP-7-treated cells were implanted into the flank region of male nude mice, smaller tumors, compared to those formed with the untreated cells, were observed.

Methods:   F-18 choline PET/CT was performed in 45 patients for early staging of biopsy-proven prostate cancer. None of the examined patients had received therapy before the examination. In all of them a transrectal ultrasonography had been performed earlier to calculate the prostate volume and PSA density. The mean PSA value was 25.5 (±38.1) ng/ml, whereas the mean PSA density was 0.70 (±0.88).  Results:   Results of F-18 choline PET/CT were related to PSA and PSA density. PET/CT was positive for extraprostatic disease in 18/45 patients (40%) (mean PSA and PSA density were, respectively, 44.08 ng/ml and 1.08); PET/CT was negative for extraprostatic disease in 27/45 patients (60%) (mean PSA and PSA density were, respectively, 13.12 ng/ml and 0.4). PET/CT was positive in 13/18 patients (72%) with a PSA cutoff value greater than or equal to 18 ng/ml and in 5/21 (24%) with a PSA value less than 18 ng/ml (P=0.0017). PET/CT was positive in 16/18 patients (89%) with PSA density greater than or equal to 0.31 and in 2/18 (11%) with PSA density lower than 0.31 (P=0.0234).  Conclusion:   The possibility of detecting extraprostatic disease of prostate cancer with F-18 choline PET/CT is related to PSA and PSA density. In particular, F-18 choline PET/CT should be recommended only in patients with a PSA value of at least 18 ng/ml, whereas a PSA density of at least 0.31 ng/ml is more probably associated with distant metastases.""","""['Ferdinando Calabria', 'Agostino Chiaravalloti', 'Mario Tavolozza', 'Cristiana Ragano-Caracciolo', 'Orazio Schillaci']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Nucl Med Commun""","""['Impact of 18F-choline PET/CT in prostate cancer patients with biochemical recurrence: influence of androgen deprivation therapy and correlation with PSA kinetics.', 'Clinical utility of (18)F-fluorocholine positron-emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) in biochemical relapse of prostate cancer after radical treatment: results of a multicentre study.', 'Gleason score at diagnosis predicts the rate of detection of 18F-choline PET/CT performed when biochemical evidence indicates recurrence of prostate cancer: experience with 1,000 patients.', 'Imaging of prostate cancer with PET/CT and radioactively labeled choline derivates.', 'Diagnostic relevance of choline-PET\u200a/\u200aCT in patients with prostate cancer.', 'Initial prostate cancer diagnosis and disease staging--the role of choline-PET-CT.', 'Advanced imaging for the early diagnosis of local recurrence prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy.']"""

We hypothesized that these criteria may be excessively strict, precluding many men from active surveillance.  Materials and methods:   We studied pathological outcomes in men treated with radical prostatectomy between 1995 and 2012 who met 4 or more of the 5 active surveillance criteria. Outcomes included a definition of significant tumor (pathological Gleason 7 or greater, or nonorgan confined). We compared adverse pathology rates between men who met all 5 vs 4 of 5 active surveillance criteria.  Results:   Of 8,261 men 1,890 (22.9%) met all active surveillance eligibility criteria and 2,133 (25.8%) met 4. Men with values exceeding prostate specific antigen density and biopsy Gleason criteria were at increased risk for adverse pathological outcomes. Clinical stage greater than T1 was not associated with adverse pathological findings. The risk of significant tumors in men with clinical stage T2 lesions, 3 or fewer positive biopsy cores and less than 60% core involvement was comparable to that of men who met all active surveillance criteria.  Conclusions:   Prostate specific antigen density greater than 0.15 ng/ml and biopsy Gleason score 7 or greater are strongly associated with adverse pathological findings at radical prostatectomy. Our findings suggest that active surveillance criteria should be expanded to include men with clinical stage T2 lesions and a greater number of positive biopsy cores of low grade.

Materials and methods:   We evaluated a cohort of 183 patients who underwent 3 Tesla multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging, including T2-weighted, diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging and dynamic contrast enhanced sequences, with an endorectal coil before radical prostatectomy. Pathological stage at radical prostatectomy was used as standard reference for extraprostatic extension. The cohort was classified into low, intermediate and high risk groups according to the D'Amico criteria. We recorded prevalence of extraprostatic extension at radical prostatectomy and determined sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging for extraprostatic extension in each group. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify predictors of extraprostatic extension at radical prostatectomy.  Results:   The overall prevalence of extraprostatic extension at radical prostatectomy was 49.7% ranging from 24.7% to 77.1% between low and high risk categories. Overall staging accuracy of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging for extraprostatic extension was 73.8%, with sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of 58.2%, 89.1%, 84.1% and 68.3%, respectively. Positive predictive value of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging for extraprostatic extension was best in the high risk cohort with 88.8%. Negative predictive value was highest in the low risk cohort with 87.7%. With an odds ratio of 10.3 multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging is by far the best preoperative predictor of extraprostatic extension at radical prostatectomy.

Age, serum creatinine, estimated GFR, body mass index, total PSA (tPSA), free PSA (fPSA), per cent free PSA (%fPSA), comorbidities, biopsy Gleason sum and per cent positive core were retrospectively reviewed. All parameters were compared to show whether patients with GFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m(2) (group A) have higher risk of prostate cancer than patients with GFR ≥ 60 (group B). The primary endpoint was cancer detection rate and the secondary endpoints were differences in mean tPSA, fPSA, %fPSA and pathologic outcomes.  Results:   A total of 1092 men (243 cancer patients) were included. Mean age was 65.8 ± 7.7 years. No differences in mean age and tPSA were found between groups A and B.

This relationship has been found for several causes of death in Spanish cities in independent analyses (the MEDEA project). However, no joint analysis which pools the strength of this relationship across several cities has ever been undertaken. Such an analysis would determine, if appropriate, a joint relationship by linking the associations found.  Methods:   A pooled cross-sectional analysis of the data from the MEDEA project has been carried out for each of the causes of death studied. Specifically, a meta-analysis has been carried out to pool the relative risks in eleven Spanish cities. Different deprivation-mortality relationships across the cities are considered in the analysis (fixed and random effects models). The size of the cities is also considered as a possible factor explaining differences between cities.  Results:   Twenty studies have been carried out for different combinations of sex and causes of death. For nine of them (men: prostate cancer, diabetes, mental illnesses, Alzheimer's disease, cerebrovascular disease; women: diabetes, mental illnesses, respiratory diseases, cirrhosis) no differences were found between cities in the effect of deprivation on mortality; in four cases (men: respiratory diseases, all causes of mortality; women: breast cancer, Alzheimer's disease) differences not associated with the size of the city have been determined; in two cases (men: cirrhosis; women: lung cancer) differences strictly linked to the size of the city have been determined, and in five cases (men: lung cancer, ischaemic heart disease; women: ischaemic heart disease, cerebrovascular diseases, all causes of mortality) both kinds of differences have been found. Except for lung cancer in women, every significant relationship between deprivation and mortality goes in the same direction: deprivation increases mortality. Variability in the relative risks across cities was found for general mortality for both sexes.

Clinical experience suggests that surgeons may opt for non-NS RP in patients with impaired baseline EF.  Aim:   This study was performed to define if baseline EF is an independent predictor of NS status during RP.  Methods:   A total of 2,323 mean (mean age 59 ± 7 years) who underwent RP at a tertiary referral academic medical center were retrospectively evaluated. Patients who underwent preoperative radiation therapy or androgen deprivation treatment were excluded.  Main outcome measures:   Preoperative parameters evaluated included biopsy pathological characteristics, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, patient age, and EF. Baseline EF was graded on a validated five-point patient reported scale. NSS was graded intraoperatively by the surgeon, using a four-point NS score assigned to each nerve where 1 = fully preserved, 2 = partially preserved, 3 = minimally preserved, and 4 = resected. NS surgery was defined as NSS of 1 or 2 on both sides, and nerve resection surgery was defined as NSS of 3 or greater on both sides.  Results:   On univariate analysis, factors related to nerve resection surgery included (all P < 0.01): increasing age (r = 0.16), Gleason score (r = 0.19), EF score (r = 0.21), percentage biopsy cores positive (r = 0.11), higher preoperative PSA (relative risk [RR] 1.72, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.23-2.40), and clinical stage ≥T2 (RR 2.17, 95% CI 1.68-2.78). On multivariable analysis, factors independently predicting for non-NS surgery included (all P < 0.01): baseline EF (odds ratio [OR] 1.50, 95% CI 1.33-1.68), biopsy Gleason sum (OR 1.95, 95% CI 1.65-2.36), clinical T stage ≥T2 (OR 1.59, 95% CI 1.15-2.20), patient age (OR 1.07, 95% CI 1.04-1.09), and percentage of biopsy cores positive (OR 1.01, 95% CI 1.00-1.02).  Conclusions:   While unfavorable clinical and prostate biopsy characteristics predict less NS, we have shown that poorer baseline EF also independently predicts for nerve resection RP. For every point increase in EF score (that is, worsening EF) the odds of not receiving NS during surgery increase by a factor of 1.5. Although NS is not associated with worse cancer outcomes in appropriately selected patients, failure to spare nerves is associated with poor post-operative EF, urinary continence, and increased severity of cavernous venous leak. Patient anxiety related to cancer diagnosis and impending treatment may lead to falsely-worsened apparent EF when recent erections are assessed during a pre-operative planning visit. For these reasons prostatectomists should consider NS based solely on factors other than patient's baseline EF, even when it is impaired.""","""['Doron S Stember', 'Christian J Nelson', 'John P Mulhall']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Sex Med""","""['Recovery of erectile function after radical prostatectomy is quantitatively related to the response to intraoperative cavernous nerve stimulation.', 'Exploratory Decision-Tree Modeling of Data from the Randomized REACTT Trial of Tadalafil Versus Placebo to Predict Recovery of Erectile Function After Bilateral Nerve-Sparing Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Are We Improving Erectile Function Recovery After Radical Prostatectomy?

Previous small, cross-sectional studies reported positive associations between circulating nitrate/nitrite levels and cancer. Prospective studies examining the association between plasma nitrate and cancer, especially prostate cancer, are lacking.  Methods:   We conducted a nested case-control study within the Health Professionals Follow-up Study. Baseline blood samples were collected in 1994, and incident cases of prostate cancer were identified from 1997 to 2005. Baseline plasma levels of nitrate were measured in the 630 cases and 630 matched controls.  Results:   We have found that baseline levels of plasma nitrate were not associated with risk of prostate cancer. Compared to quintile 1, the relative risk from quintiles 2 to 5 were 1.13 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.78-1.63], 0.93 (95% CI, 0.63-1.38), 0.95 (95% CI, 0.65-1.39), and 0.99 (95% CI, 0.68-1.48); Ptrend was 0.9 after adjustment of multivariate risk factors. When analyses were restricted to men fasting more than 6 hours, the trend was similar. Furthermore, plasma nitrate seemed to be inversely associated with advanced-stage prostate cancer. The relative risk across extreme quartiles was 0.44 (95% CI, 0.17-1.12; Ptrend = 0.07) for the whole dataset and 0.30 (95% CI, 0.09-0.99; Ptrend = 0.05) for the fasting dataset.  Conclusions:   In summary, we did not find an increased risk of prostate cancer associated with higher plasma nitrate levels. A potential protective association between nitrate and aggressive forms of prostate cancer requires confirmation.

Those which suppress bcl-2 activity (in prostate cancer patients) have even reached clinical trials. We evaluated a set of oligos which targeted and comparably suppressed the expression of bcl-2, an apoptosis inhibitory protein. Our first study reported that LNCaP cells were adapted by suppression of caspase-3 (a promoter of apoptosis). In this study we evaluated additional proteins associated with tumor progression and found the expression of the androgen receptor, its p300 and IL-6 co-activators, as well as v-myc (oncogenic) and (unexpectedly) tumor suppressor p53 genes to be enhanced. We conclude that oligo treatment directed against bcl-2, intended to stimulate apoptosis, can be evaded through compensatory changes in gene activity associated with additional regulators of apoptosis, androgen sensitivity and oncogenesis.

Aberrant signaling through the interleukin 6/Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) axis in cancer cells has emerged as a major mechanism for cancer progression. In this study, we demonstrate that interleukin 6 induces both WASF3 expression and phosphoactivation in breast and prostate cancer cell lines through the JAK2/STAT3 pathway in two different ways. First, we show that STAT3 binds directly to the WASF3 promoter and increases transcription levels, which correlates with increased migration potential. Inactivation of STAT3 with short hairpin RNA, dominant negative constructs or S3I-201 leads to reduced WASF3 levels and reduced migration. Second, we have shown that JAK2, while activating STAT3, also interacts with and activates WASF3. Inhibition of JAK2 with short hairpin RNA or AG490 leads to loss of migration due to reduced WASF3 activation levels and prevention of its membrane localization. Together, these results define a novel signaling network whereby JAK2/STAT3 signaling creates a feed-forward loop to raise activated WASF3 levels that promote cancer cell motility.""","""['Yong Teng', 'Pushpankur Ghoshal', 'Lambert Ngoka', 'Yun Mei', 'John K Cowell']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Carcinogenesis""","""['SHOX2 cooperates with STAT3 to promote breast cancer metastasis through the transcriptional activation of WASF3.', 'Targeting WASF3 Signaling in Metastatic Cancer.', 'Inactivation of the WASF3 gene in prostate cancer cells leads to suppression of tumorigenicity and metastases.', 'Functional interrelationship between the WASF3 and KISS1 metastasis-associated genes in breast cancer cells.', 'The involvement of JAK-STAT3 in cell motility, invasion, and metastasis.', 'Drug resistance related genes in lung adenocarcinoma predict patient prognosis and influence the tumor microenvironment.', 'KLF4 suppresses the proliferation and metastasis of NSCLC cells via inhibition of MSI2 and regulation of the JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway.', 'SHOX2 cooperates with STAT3 to promote breast cancer metastasis through the transcriptional activation of WASF3.', 'Role of LncRNAs in the Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.', 'Phosphorylation of the proline-rich domain of WAVE3 drives its oncogenic activity in breast cancer.']"""

Growth Arrest-Specific 5 (GAS5) encodes multiple snoRNAs within its introns, while exonic sequences produce lncRNA which can act as a riborepressor of the glucocorticoid and related receptors. GAS5 negatively regulates the survival of lymphoid and breast cells, and is aberrantly expressed in several cancers. Although cellular GAS5 levels decline as prostate cancer cells acquire castration-resistance, the influence of GAS5 on prostate cell survival has not been determined. To address this question, prostate cell lines were transfected with GAS5-encoding plasmids or GAS5 siRNAs, and cell survival was assessed. Basal apoptosis increased, and cell survival decreased, after transfection of 22Rv1 cells with plasmids encoding GAS5 transcripts, including mature GAS5 lncRNA. Similar effects were observed in PC-3 cells. In stable clones of 22Rv1, cell death correlated strongly with cellular GAS5 levels. Induction of 22Rv1 cell death by UV-C irradiation and chemotherapeutic drugs was augmented in cells transiently transfected with GAS5 constructs, and attenuated following down-regulation of GAS5 expression. Again, in these experiments, cell death was strongly correlated with cellular GAS5 levels. Thus, GAS5 promotes the apoptosis of prostate cells, and exonic sequence, i.e. GAS5 lncRNA, is sufficient to mediate this activity. Abnormally low levels of GAS5 expression may therefore reduce the effectiveness of chemotherapeutic agents. Although several lncRNAs have recently been shown to control cell survival, this is the first report of a death-promoting lncRNA in prostate cells.""","""['M R Pickard', 'M Mourtada-Maarabouni', 'G T Williams']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Biochim Biophys Acta""","""['Reciprocal regulation of GAS5 lncRNA levels and mTOR inhibitor action in prostate cancer cells.', 'The hormone response element mimic sequence of GAS5 lncRNA is sufficient to induce apoptosis in breast cancer cells.', 'The long non-coding RNA, GAS5, enhances gefitinib-induced cell death in innate EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor-resistant lung adenocarcinoma cells with wide-type EGFR via downregulation of the IGF-1R expression.', 'The growth arrest-specific transcript 5 (GAS5): a pivotal tumor suppressor long noncoding RNA in human cancers.', 'The Growth-Arrest-Specific (GAS)-5 Long Non-Coding RNA: A Fascinating lncRNA Widely Expressed in Cancers.', ""The Biologist's Guide to the Glucocorticoid Receptor's Structure."", 'Role of non-coding RNAs in neuroblastoma.', 'Glyphosate and Aminomethylphosphonic Acid (AMPA) Modulate Glutathione S-Transferase in Non-Tumorigenic Prostate Cells.', 'TP63 Functions as a Tumor Suppressor Regulated by GAS5/miR-221-3p Signaling Axis in Human Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Cells.', 'Small molecule targeting long noncoding RNA GAS5 administered intranasally improves neuronal insulin signaling and decreases neuroinflammation in an aged mouse model.']"""

Results:   Mean age was 58.6 years; mean PSA was 6.6 ng/ml, predominant Gleason score was 6 (3+3), 76%were unilateral tumors and 90%were organ-confined, 10% had extracapsular extension, none had involvement of the seminal % vesicles, 15% of the patients had Gleason score >6 and surgical margins were positive in 30% of the specimens.

However, only approximately 30% of men with suspicion of cancer have it confirmed on prostate biopsy, and not all of these need treatment. Detection of circulating tumor cells in localized prostate cancer has given variable results, but it could be a useful complementary screening tool to detect prostate cancer in men with abnormal screening tests before the evaluation with prostate biopsy. This may be more so in subsequent biopsies where serum PSA has a decreased diagnostic yield. To evaluate the diagnostic yield of the detection of CPCs as a complementary PC screening test in a population fulfilling criteria for an initial, second and third prostate biopsy for suspicion of PC.  Methods:   A prospective screening study of consecutive patients aged 45-80 years presenting to the urologist for PC screening. Inclusion criteria were PSA >4.0 ng/ml, PSA velocity >0.35 ng/ml/year and/or DRE suspicious for cancer. Patients fulfilling inclusion criteria had blood taken for CPC detection and then underwent 12-core transrectal prostate biopsy. Double immune-his-tochemical staining with anti-PSA and anti-P504S was used to detect CPCs. Both cytologist and pathologist were blinded to the results of the biopsy, CPC results and clinical details. The diagnostic yield of the presence or absence of CPC was evaluated; the prostate biopsy was classified as cancer or no-cancer.  Results:   282 men participated, 83 undergoing of these undergoing a second and 38 a third biopsy, with a mean age of 66.2 ± 8.9 years and a median serum PSA of 5.10 ng/ml, 5.45 ng/ml and 6.45 ng/ml for first, second and third biopsies. Cancer was detected in 33,6%, 10.8% and 29.0% of first, second and third biopsies respectively, CPCs were detected in 36.9%, 21.7% and 36.8% of the patients.

Here, we show that global levels of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) and H3K27me3 are highly correlated across a variety of somatic tissues. In multiple hierarchically organized tissues, both marks showed almost identical cell-by-cell distribution patterns that exhibited a tight association with differentiation. In particular, tissue stem cell compartments were characterized by low levels of both marks, whereas differentiated cell compartments exhibited high levels of 5hmC and H3K27me3. This pattern of correlation between the two marks could be recapitulated in an in vitro model system of induced differentiation in prostate epithelial cells. While the correlation between 5hmC and H3K27me3 levels is also maintained in human cancers, the degree of correlation is reduced.

Because suppression of E-cadherin protein concomitant with induction of mesenchymal markers (e.g., vimentin) is a biochemical hallmark of epithelial-mesenchymal transition, a process implicated in cancer metastasis, we hypothesized that PEITC treatment was likely to suppress vimentin protein expression. Contrary to this prediction, exposure of human breast (MDA-MB-231) and prostate cancer cells (PC-3 and DU145) to PEITC resulted in a dose-dependent increase in vimentin protein level, which was observed as early as 6 h posttreatment and persisted for the duration of the experiment (24 h). RNA interference of vimentin resulted in a modest augmentation of PEITC-mediated inhibition of MDA-MB-231 and PC-3 cell migration as well as cell viability.

In this study, expression of cell surface and stromal proteoglycans (glypican-1, perlecan, syndecan-1, aggrecan, versican, NG2, brevican, decorin, and lumican) in normal tissue and prostate tumours was determined by RT-PCR analysis and immunostaining with core protein- and GAG-specific antibodies. In normal human prostate tissue, versican, decorin, and biglycan were predominant proteoglycans localised in tissue stroma, and syndecan-1 and glypican-1 were expressed mainly by epithelial cells. In prostate tumours, complex changes in proteoglycans occur, with a common trend towards decrease of decorin and lumican expression, overall increase of syndecan-1 and glypican-1 expression in tumour stroma along with its disappearance in tumour epithelial cells, and aggrecan and NG2 expressions in some prostate tumours.

Epsins are reportedly upregulated in several types of cancer including human skin, lung, and canine mammary cancers. However, whether their expression is elevated in prostate cancer is unknown. In this study, we investigated the potential role of epsins in prostate tumorigenesis using the wild type or epsin-deficient human prostate cancer cells, LNCaP, in a human xenograft model, and the spontaneous TRAMP mouse model in wild type or epsin-deficient background. Here, we reported that the expression of epsins 1 and 2 is upregulated in both human and mouse prostate cancer cells and cancerous tissues. Consistent with upregulation of epsins in prostate tumors, we discovered that depletion of epsins impaired tumor growth in both the human LNCaP xenograft and the TRAMP mouse prostate. Furthermore, epsin depletion significantly prolonged survival in the TRAMP mouse model. In summary, our findings suggest that epsins may act as oncogenic proteins to promote prostate tumorigenesis and that depletion or inhibition of epsins may provide a novel therapeutic target for future prostate cancer therapies.""","""['Kandice L Tessneer', 'Satish Pasula', 'Xiaofeng Cai', 'Yunzhou Dong', 'Xiaolei Liu', 'Lili Yu', 'Scott Hahn', 'John McManus', 'Yiyuan Chen', 'Baojun Chang', 'Hong Chen']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""ISRN Oncol""","""['Epsin Family of Endocytic Adaptor Proteins as Oncogenic Regulators of Cancer Progression.', 'Targeting Epsins to Inhibit Fibroblast Growth Factor Signaling While Potentiating Transforming Growth Factor-β Signaling Constrains Endothelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition in Atherosclerosis.', 'Endothelial epsin deficiency decreases tumor growth by enhancing VEGF signaling.', 'Epsin: inducing membrane curvature.', 'Epsins in vascular development, function and disease.', 'Endocytosis in cancer and cancer therapy.', 'Longitudinal analysis of individual cfDNA methylome patterns in metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Endocytic Adaptors in Cardiovascular Disease.', 'Epsins 1 and 2 promote NEMO linear ubiquitination via LUBAC to drive breast cancer development.', 'Epsin-mediated degradation of IP3R1 fuels atherosclerosis.']"""

Bone loss has been linked with human multiple myeloma, breast cancer, and prostate cancer and is usually treated with bisphosphonates, and recently approved denosumab, an antibody against receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL). Because of the numerous side effects of the currently available drugs, the search continues for safe and effective therapies for bone loss. RANKL, a member of the TNF superfamily, has emerged as a major mediator of bone loss via activation of osteoclastogenesis. We have identified cardamonin, a chalcone isolated from Alpinia katsumadai Hayata that can affect osteoclastogenesis through modulation of RANKL. We found that treatment of monocytes with cardamonin suppressed RANKL-induced NF-κB activation and this suppression correlated with inhibition of IκBα kinase and of phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα, an inhibitor of NF-κB. Furthermore, cardamonin also downregulated RANKL-induced phosphorylation of MAPK including ERK and p38 MAPK. Cardamonin suppressed the RANKL-induced differentiation of monocytes to osteoclasts in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner. We also found that an inhibitor of NF-κB essential modulator (NEMO) blocked RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis, indicating a direct link with NF-κB. Finally, osteoclastogenesis induced by human breast cancer cells or human multiple myeloma cells were completely suppressed by cardamonin. Collectively, our results indicate that cardamonin suppresses osteoclastogenesis induced by RANKL and tumor cells by suppressing activation of the NF-κB and MAPK pathway.""","""['Bokyung Sung', 'Sahdeo Prasad', 'Vivek R Yadav', 'Subash C Gupta', 'Simone Reuter', 'Norio Yamamoto', 'Akira Murakami', 'Bharat B Aggarwal']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Guggulsterone inhibits osteoclastogenesis induced by receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB ligand and by tumor cells by suppressing nuclear factor-kappaB activation.', 'Butein, a tetrahydroxychalcone, suppresses cancer-induced osteoclastogenesis through inhibition of receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB ligand signaling.', 'Calebin A downregulates osteoclastogenesis through suppression of RANKL signalling.', 'The Role of TAK1 in RANKL-Induced Osteoclastogenesis.', 'Effects of RANKL-Targeted Therapy in Immunity and Cancer.', 'Effect of pinocembrin isolated from Alpinia zerumbet on osteoblast differentiation.', 'Pinus Roxburghii essential oil anticancer activity and chemical composition evaluation.', 'Bone microstructure and regional distribution of osteoblast and osteoclast activity in the osteonecrotic femoral head.']"""

Objective:   The objective of the study was to determine whether NR2F2 plays a role in ovarian cancer and dissect its potential mechanisms of action.  Design, setting, and patients:   We examined NR2F2 expression in healthy ovary and ovarian cancers using quantitative PCR and immunohistochemistry. NR2F2 expression was targeted in established ovarian cancer cell lines to assess the impact of dysregulated NR2F2 expression in the epithelial compartment of ovarian cancers.  Results:   Our results indicate that NR2F2 is robustly expressed in the stroma of healthy ovary with little or no expression in epithelia lining the ovarian surface, clefts, or crypts. This pattern of NR2F2 expression was markedly disrupted in ovarian cancers, in which decreased levels of stromal expression and ectopic epithelial expression were frequently observed. Ovarian cancers with the most disrupted patterns of NR2F2 were associated with significantly shorter disease-free interval by Kaplan-Meier analysis. Targeting NR2F2 expression in established ovarian cancer cell lines enhanced apoptosis and increased proliferation. In addition, we found that NR2F2 regulates the expression of NEK2, RAI14, and multiple other genes involved in the cell cycle, suggesting potential pathways by which dysregulated expression of NR2F2 impacts ovarian cancer.

Therefore, the aim of our study was to assess expression of hTERT (human telomerase reverse transcriptase, a catalytic subunit of telomerase) and prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), both considered to be markers of tumor aggressiveness. 140 low advanced PC specimens from patients who underwent radical prostatectomy were studied. Protein expression was assessed immunohistochemically on tumor sections and expressed as labeling index (LI), i.e. the percentage of positively stained cells. In case of telomerase, only nuclear staining and in case of PSMA, membrane and cytoplasmic staining, were considered as positive. The mean age of the patients was 62.9 ± 6.2 years. There were 75 (53.6%) well differentiated tumors (Gleason score ≤ 6), 52 (37.1%) moderately differentiated tumors (Gleason score of 7) and 13 (9.3%) poorly differentiated tumors (Gleason score 8-10). The mean pre-operative serum PSA was 9.9 ± SE 5.5 ng/mL, and the mean LI were 18.0 ± 1.5% and 44.1 ± 1.9%, for hTERT and PSMA, respectively. With increase of pathological tumor stage and tumor grade statistically significant increase of PSA serum concentration (P < 0.011) and PSMA (P < 0.004) expression was noticed, however, for expression of telomerase the relation was opposite one. The observed in higher pTNM stages and tumor grades decrease in nuclear expression of hTERT was caused by translocation of the subunit to the cytoplasm, what may indicate extranuclear telomerase activity independent of telomere lengthening, hence, it cannot be considered as a marker of malignancy. Higher PSMA expression in higher pTNM stages and tumor grades suggest that PSMA may be a good marker of biological aggressiveness suitable for patients' selection for more aggressive treatment.""","""['Anna Gasinska', 'Elzbieta Luczynska', 'Waclaw Wilk', 'Anna Cichocka']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Folia Histochem Cytobiol""","""['Expression of Ki-67 (MIB-1) and GLUT-1 proteins in non-advanced prostatic cancer.', 'More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Microvessel density and expression of vascular endothelial growth factor in clinically localized prostate cancer.', '99mTechnetium-based Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen-radioguided Surgery in Recurrent Prostate Cancer.', 'Expression of prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) in prostatic adenocarcinoma and prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia.', 'Polyploid Giant Cancer Cells Are Frequently Found in the Urine of Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'Effect of Dickkopf-1 (Dkk-1) and SP600125, a JNK Inhibitor, on Wnt Signaling in Canine Prostate Cancer Growth and Bone Metastases.', 'Prognostic Significance of Serum PSA Level and Telomerase, VEGF and GLUT-1 Protein Expression for the Biochemical Recurrence in Prostate Cancer Patients after Radical Prostatectomy.']"""

Radiotherapy is indicated after prostatectomy in select patients who have adverse pathologic features and in those with recurrent disease.  Objectives:   To examine the patterns of use of intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), a newer, more expensive technology that may reduce radiation dose to adjacent organs compared with the older conformal radiotherapy (CRT) in the postprostatectomy setting, and to compare disease control and morbidity outcomes of these treatments.  Design and setting:   Data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare-linked database were used to identify patients with a diagnosis of prostate cancer who had received radiotherapy within 3 years after prostatectomy.  Participants:   Patients who received IMRT or CRT.  Main outcomes and measures:   The outcomes of 457 IMRT and 557 CRT patients who received radiotherapy between 2002 and 2007 were compared using their claims through 2009. We used propensity score methods to balance baseline characteristics and estimate adjusted incidence rate ratios (RRs) and their 95% CIs for measured outcomes.  Results:   Use of IMRT increased from zero in 2000 to 82.1% in 2009. Men who received IMRT vs CRT showed no significant difference in rates of long-term gastrointestinal morbidity (RR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.66-1.37), urinary nonincontinent morbidity (0.93; 0.66-1.33), urinary incontinence (0.98; 0.71-1.35), or erectile dysfunction (0.85; 0.61-1.19). There was no significant difference in subsequent treatment for recurrent disease (RR, 1.31; 95% CI, 0.90-1.92).  Conclusions and relevance:   Postprostatectomy IMRT and CRT achieved similar morbidity and cancer control outcomes. The potential clinical benefit of IMRT in this setting is unclear. Given that IMRT is more expensive, its use for postprostatectomy radiotherapy may not be cost-effective compared with CRT, although formal analysis is needed.""","""['Gregg H Goldin', 'Nathan C Sheets', 'Anne-Marie Meyer', 'Tzy-Mey Kuo', 'Yang Wu', 'Til Stürmer', 'Paul A Godley', 'William R Carpenter', 'Ronald C Chen']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""JAMA Intern Med""","""['Expanding utilization of intensity-modulated radiotherapy for prostate cancer: soaring costs, dubious benefits: comment on ""Comparative effectiveness of intensity-modulated radiotherapy and conventional conformal radiotherapy in the treatment of prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy"".', 'Treatment-related complications of radiation therapy after radical prostatectomy: comparative effectiveness of intensity-modulated versus conformal radiation therapy.', 'Intensity-modulated radiation therapy, proton therapy, or conformal radiation therapy and morbidity and disease control in localized prostate cancer.', 'Improved toxicity profile following high-dose postprostatectomy salvage radiation therapy with intensity-modulated radiation therapy.', 'Intensity-modulated radiotherapy for the treatment of prostate cancer: a systematic review and economic evaluation.', 'Cost of New Technologies in Prostate Cancer Treatment: Systematic Review of Costs and Cost Effectiveness of Robotic-assisted Laparoscopic Prostatectomy, Intensity-modulated Radiotherapy, and Proton Beam Therapy.', 'Comparison Between Dose-Escalated Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy and 3-Dimensional Conformal Radiation Therapy for Salvage Radiation Therapy After Prostatectomy.', 'Overall Survival After Treatment of Localized Prostate Cancer With Proton Beam Therapy, External-Beam Photon Therapy, or Brachytherapy.', 'Transitioning from conformal radiotherapy to intensity-modulated radiotherapy after radical prostatectomy: Clinical benefit, oncologic outcomes and incidence of gastrointestinal and urinary toxicities.', 'Impact of advanced radiotherapy techniques and dose intensification on toxicity of salvage radiotherapy after radical prostatectomy.', 'Treatment-Related Toxicity Using Prostate-Only Versus Prostate and Pelvic Lymph Node Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy: A National Population-Based Study.']"""

Many urologists have shifted from the open surgical approach to minimally invasive techniques. It is not clear whether the risk of post-prostatectomy incisional hernia varies by surgical approach.  Materials and methods:   In the linked Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER)-Medicare data set we identified men 66 years old or older who were treated with minimally invasive or open radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer diagnosed from 2003 to 2007. The main study outcome was incisional hernia repair, as identified in Medicare claims after prostatectomy. We also examined the frequency of umbilical, inguinal and other hernia repairs.  Results:   We identified 3,199 and 6,795 patients who underwent minimally invasive and open radical prostatectomy, respectively. The frequency of incisional hernia repair was 5.3% at a median 3.1-year followup in the minimally invasive group and 1.9% at a 4.4-year median followup in the open group, corresponding to an incidence rate of 16.1 and 4.5/1,000 person-years, respectively. Compared to the open technique, the minimally invasive procedure was associated with more than a threefold increased risk of incisional hernia repair when controlling for patient and disease characteristics (adjusted HR 3.39, 95% CI 2.63-4.38, p<0.0001). Minimally invasive radical prostatectomy was associated with an attenuated but increased risk of any hernia repair compared with open radical prostatectomy (adjusted HR 1.48, 95% CI 1.29-1.70, p<0.0001).  Conclusions:   Minimally invasive radical prostatectomy was associated with a significantly increased risk of incisional hernia compared with open radical prostatectomy. This is a potentially remediable complication of prostate cancer surgery that warrants increased vigilance with respect to surgical technique.""","""['Sigrid V Carlsson', 'Behfar Ehdaie', 'Coral L Atoria', 'Elena B Elkin', 'James A Eastham']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Editorial comment.', 'Words of wisdom.

Methods and materials:   Forty-seven failures and 47 controls were selected from 1006 consecutive low- and intermediate-risk patients treated with prostate (125)I brachytherapy (July 1998-October 2003). Median follow-up was 7.5 years. Ten-year actuarial disease-free survival was 94.1%. Controls were matched using age, initial prostate-specific antigen level, clinical stage, Gleason score, use of hormone therapy, and follow-up (all P nonsignificant). Seventy-eight specimens were successfully processed; 27 control and 20 failure specimens contained more than 100 tumor cells were used for the final analysis. The Feulgen-Thionin stained cytology samples from archived paraffin blocks were used to determine the DNA ploidy of each tumor by measuring integrated optical densities.  Results:   The samples were divided into diploid and aneuploid tumors. Aneuploid tumors were found in 16 of 20 of the failures (80%) and 8 of 27 controls (30%). Diploid DNA patients had a significantly lower rate of disease recurrence (P=.0086) (hazard ratio [HR] 0.256). On multivariable analysis, patients with aneuploid tumors had a higher prostate-specific antigen failure rate (HR 5.13). Additionally, those with ""excellent"" dosimetry (V100 >90%; D90 >144 Gy) had a significantly lower recurrence rate (HR 0.25). All patients with aneuploid tumors and dosimetry classified as ""nonexcellent"" (V100 <90%; D90 <144 Gy) (5 of 5) had disease recurrence, compared with 40% of patients with aneuploid tumors and ""excellent"" dosimetry (8 of 15). In contrast, dosimetry did not affect the outcome for diploid patients.  Conclusions:   Using core biopsy material from archived paraffin blocks, DNA ploidy correctly classified the majority of failures and nonfailures in this study. The results suggest that DNA ploidy can be used as a useful marker for aggressiveness of localized prostate cancer.

Methods and materials:   Twenty passively scattered proton lung cancer plans, 10 prostate, and 1 brain cancer scanning-beam proton plan(s) were analyzed. To account for the dose under uncertainties, we performed a comprehensive simulation in which the dose was recalculated 600 times per given plan under the influence of random and systematic setup errors and proton range errors. On the basis of simulation results, we determined the probability of dose variations and calculated the expected values and standard deviations of dose-volume histograms. The uncertainties in dose were spatially visualized on the planning CT as a probability map of failure to target coverage or overdose of critical structures.  Results:   The expected value of target coverage under the uncertainties was consistently lower than that of the nominal value determined from the clinical target volume coverage without setup error or range uncertainty, with a mean difference of -1.1% (-0.9% for breath-hold), -0.3%, and -2.2% for lung, prostate, and a brain cases, respectively. The organs with most sensitive dose under uncertainties were esophagus and spinal cord for lung, rectum for prostate, and brain stem for brain cancer.  Conclusions:   A clinically feasible robustness plan analysis tool based on direct dose calculation and statistical simulation has been developed. Both the expectation value and standard deviation are useful to evaluate the impact of uncertainties. The existing proton beam planning method used in this institution seems to be adequate in terms of target coverage.

To this end, a model system based on the prostate specific membrane antigen-targeting antibody J591, the positron-emitting radiometal (89)Zr, and the chelator desferrioxamine has been employed. The methodology consists of four steps: (1) the removal of sugars on the heavy chain region of the antibody to expose terminal N-acetylglucosamine residues; (2) the incorporation of azide-modified N-acetylgalactosamine monosaccharides into the glycans of the antibody; (3) the catalyst-free click conjugation of desferrioxamine-modified dibenzocyclooctynes to the azide-bearing sugars; and (4) the radiolabeling of the chelator-modified antibody with (89)Zr.

Methods:   We used immunohistochemistry based on a highly FSHR-specific monoclonal antibody to detect FSHR in cancer metastases from 6 major tumor types (lung, breast, prostate, colon, kidney, and leiomyosarcoma ) to 6 frequent locations (bone, liver, lymph node, brain, lung, and pleura) of 209 patients.  Results:   In 166 patients examined (79%), FSHR was expressed by blood vessels associated with metastatic tissue. FSHR-positive vessels were present in the interior of the tumors and some few millimeters outside, in the normally appearing tissue. In the interior of the metastases, the density of the FSHR-positive vessels was constant up to 7 mm, the maximum depth available in the analyzed sections. No significant differences were noticed between the density of FSHR-positive vessels inside vs. outside tumors for metastases from lung, breast, colon, and kidney cancers. In contrast, for prostate cancer metastases, the density of FSHR-positive vessels was about 3-fold higher at the exterior of the tumor compared to the interior. Among brain metastases, the density of FSHR-positive vessels was highest in lung and kidney cancer, and lowest in prostate and colon cancer. In metastases of breast cancer to the lung pleura, the percentage of blood vessels expressing FSHR was positively correlated with the progesterone receptor level, but not with either HER-2 or estrogen receptors. In normal tissues corresponding to the host organs for the analyzed metastases, obtained from patients not known to have cancer, FSHR staining was absent, with the exception of approx. 1% of the vessels in non tumoral temporal lobe epilepsy samples.

ESE1/ELF3 was induced by interleukin (IL)-1β through NF-κB and was a crucial mediator of the phenotypic and transcriptional changes induced by IL-1β in prostate cancer cells. This linkage was mediated by interaction of ESE1/ELF3 with the NF-κB subunits p65 and p50, acting by enhancing their nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity and by inducing p50 transcription. Supporting these findings, gene expression profiling revealed an enrichment of NF-κB effector functions in prostate cancer cells or tumors expressing high levels of ESE1/ELF3.

We examined the existing data on PCa patients treated with ADT plus anti-androgens to analyze ADT effects on primary tumor size, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) values, and metastatic incidence. We found that the current ADT with anti-androgens might lead to primary tumor reduction, with PSA decreased yet metastases increased in some PCa patients. Using in vitro and in vivo metastasis models with four human PCa cell lines, we evaluated the effects of the currently used anti-androgens, Casodex/bicalutamide and MDV3100/enzalutamide, and the newly developed anti-AR compounds, ASC-J9® and cryptotanshinone, on PCa cell growth and invasion. In vitro results showed that 10 μm Casodex or MDV3100 treatments suppressed PCa cell growth and reduced PSA level yet significantly enhanced PCa cell invasion. In vivo mice studies using an orthotopic xenograft mouse model also confirmed these results. In contrast, ASC-J9® led to suppressed PCa cell growth and cell invasion in in vitro and in vivo models. Mechanism dissection indicated these Casodex/MDV3100 treatments enhanced the TGF-β1/Smad3/MMP9 pathway, but ASC-J9® and cryptotanshinone showed promising anti-invasion effects via down-regulation of MMP9 expression.

The microenvironment is critical to the fate of CSCs. We have found that a normal stem cell (NSC) line from human prostate (WPE-stem) is recruited into CSC-like cells by nearby, but noncontiguous, arsenic-transformed isogenic malignant epithelial cells (MECs).  Objective:   It is unknown whether this recruitment of NSCs into CSCs by noncontact co-culture is specific to arsenic-transformed MECs. Thus, we used co-culture to examine the effects of neighboring noncontiguous cadmium-transformed MECs (Cd-MECs) and N-methyl-N-nitrosourea-transformed MECs (MNU-MECs) on NSCs.  Results:   After 2 weeks of noncontact Cd-MEC co-culture, NSCs showed elevated metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and MMP-2 secretion, increased invasiveness, increased colony formation, decreased PTEN expression, and formation of aggressive, highly branched duct-like structures from single cells in Matrigel, all characteristics typical of cancer cells. These oncogenic characteristics did not occur in NSCs co-cultured with MNU-MECs. The NSCs co-cultured with Cd-MECs retained self-renewal capacity, as evidenced by multiple passages (> 3) of structures formed in Matrigel. Cd-MEC-co-cultured NSCs also showed molecular (increased VIM, SNAIL1, and TWIST1 expression; decreased E-CAD expression) and morphologic evidence of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition typical for conversion to CSCs.

We conducted a 2-year prospective cohort study at a tertiary referral teaching hospital. Overall, 236 men (mean age 69.8 ± 7.1) commencing ADT for non-metastatic prostate cancer attended a baseline clinic visit between 2007 and 2011, and 153 men were eligible for follow-up after 2 years of continuous ADT. Of these, 113 men had data available for analysis at 2 years. At baseline, 87% of the men were overweight or obese, 61% had hypertension, 56% had hypercholesterolaemia, 27% prior cardiovascular disease, 11% osteoporosis and 40% osteopaenia. After 2 years of ADT, there was an increase in waist circumference (+2.8 ± 6.3 cm, p = 0.002), and, in men without diabetes, in HbA1c (+0.13 ± 0.34%, p = 0.019). Despite this, due to treatment, there were significant reductions in total cholesterol (-0.35 ± 1.00 mmol/L, p < 0.001), and blood pressure (systolic -7.6 ± 19.3 mmHg; diastolic -4.7 ± 11.6 mmHg, p < 0.001). After 2 years, men not receiving anti-resorptive therapy experienced a significant decline in lumbar spine (-0.042 ± 0.134 g/cm(2) , p = 0.012) and total hip bone mineral density (BMD) (-0.026 ± 0.036 g/cm(2) , p < 0.001), whereas bisphosphonate treatment maintained stable BMD. Prevalence of anaemia increased from 13.8 to 32.5%. Older age independently predicted a greater drop in haemoglobin (p = 0.005). We conclude that a structured approach to assess and treat men undergoing ADT effectively improves cardiovascular risk factors and prevents bone decay.

Here, we investigated the effects of brassinin (BSN), a phytoalexin first identified as a constituent of cabbage, on the PI3K/Akt/mTOR/S6K1 activation, cellular proliferation, and apoptosis in PC-3 human prostate cancer. BSN exerted a significant dose-dependent cytotoxicity and reduced constitutive phosphorylation of Akt against androgen-independent PC-3 cells as compared to androgen-dependent LNCaP cells. Moreover, knockdown of androgen receptor (AR) by small interfering RNA enhanced the potential effect of BSN on induction of apoptosis in LNCaP cells. BSN clearly suppressed the constitutive activation of PI3K/Akt/mTOR/S6K1 signaling cascade, which correlated with the induction of apoptosis as characterized by accumulation of cells in subG1 phase, positive Annexin V binding, TUNEL staining, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, down-regulation of antiapoptotic and proliferative proteins, activation of caspase-3, and cleavage of PARP. Additionally, BSN could block broad-spectrum inhibition of PI3K/Akt/mTOR/S6K1 axes, and aberrant Akt activation by pcDNA3-myr-HA-Akt1 plasmid could not prevent the observed suppressive effect of BSN on constitutive mTOR activation. Finally, overexpression of Bcl-2 also attenuated BSN-mediated apoptosis in PC-3 cells. Taken together, our findings suggest that BSN can interfere with multiple signaling cascades involved in tumorigenesis and might be provided as a potential therapeutic candidate for both the prevention and treatment of prostate cancer.""","""['Sung-Moo Kim', 'Jeong Ha Park', 'Ki Dong Kim', 'Dongwoo Nam', 'Bum Sang Shim', 'Sung-Hoon Kim', 'Kyoo Seok Ahn', 'Seung-Hoon Choi', 'Kwang Seok Ahn']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Phytother Res""","""['Embelin inhibits growth and induces apoptosis through the suppression of Akt/mTOR/S6K1 signaling cascades.', 'β-Caryophyllene oxide inhibits growth and induces apoptosis through the suppression of PI3K/AKT/mTOR/S6K1 pathways and ROS-mediated MAPKs activation.', 'mTOR is a fine tuning molecule in CDK inhibitors-induced distinct cell death mechanisms via PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling axis in prostate cancer cells.', 'The PI3K-AKT-mTOR Pathway and Prostate Cancer: At the Crossroads of AR, MAPK, and WNT Signaling.', 'Role of PI3K-AKT-mTOR Pathway as a Pro-Survival Signaling and Resistance-Mediating Mechanism to Therapy of Prostate Cancer.', 'Brassinin Induces Apoptosis, Autophagy, and Paraptosis via MAPK Signaling Pathway Activation in Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia Cells.', 'Design, Synthesis and Antiproliferative Evaluation of Bis-Indole Derivatives with a Phenyl Linker: Focus on Autophagy.', 'Assessing the Mechanism of Action of ""Fructus Ligustri Lucidi-Cuscutae Semen"" in Prostate Cancer Treatment Using Network Pharmacology and Molecular Docking.', 'FAM107A Inactivation Associated with Promoter Methylation Affects Prostate Cancer Progression through the FAK/PI3K/AKT Pathway.', 'Brassinin Promotes the Degradation of Tie2 and FGFR1 in Endothelial Cells and Inhibits Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Angiogenesis.']"""

Methods:   A total of 30 patients were included in the study. Nine men who underwent radical prostatectomy for organ-confined (pT2N0M0) cancer (OCC), 10 patients with clinically advanced cancer (CAC), and 11 controls with benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH).

Although γδ T lymphocytes can target a diversity of tumor cell types, their clinical manipulation is hampered by our limited knowledge of the molecular cues that determine γδ T cell migration toward tumors in vivo. In this study we set out to identify the chemotactic signals that orchestrate tumor infiltration by γδ T cells. We have used the preclinical transplantable B16 melanoma model to profile chemokines in tumor lesions and assess their impact on γδ TIL recruitment in vivo. We show that the inflammatory chemokine CCL2 and its receptor CCR2 are necessary for the accumulation of γδ TILs in B16 lesions, where they produce IFN-γ and display potent cytotoxic functions. Moreover, CCL2 directed γδ T cell migration in vitro toward tumor extracts, which was abrogated by anti-CCL2 neutralizing Abs. Strikingly, the lack of γδ TILs in TCRδ-deficient but also in CCR2-deficient mice enhanced tumor growth in vivo, thus revealing an unanticipated protective role for CCR2/CCL2 through the recruitment of γδ T cells. Importantly, we demonstrate that human Vδ1 T cells, but not their Vδ2 counterparts, express CCR2 and migrate to CCL2, whose expression is strongly deregulated in multiple human tumors of diverse origin, such as lung, prostate, liver, or breast cancer.

IL-6-type cytokine signalling additionally involves the recruitment and activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1 and ERK2. Both STATs and ERKs regulate responses mediated by members of the IL-6 family.

This does not simply reflect quantitative differences between ERK1 and ERK2, and the effects are not restricted to osteosarcoma cells, as they can be extended to several other cancer cell types analysed to date (such as breast, prostate, lung and cervical cancer cells). Importantly, ERK2 binds to the GP130 promoter, where it perhaps interacts with the transcriptional machinery. Indeed, its role in the transcriptional regulation of the GP130 gene was corroborated using luciferase reporter assays and messenger RNA stability experiments.

Genistein is one of the most active flavonoids in soybeans. Accumulating evidence suggests that genistein alters a variety of biological processes in estrogen-related malignancies, such as breast and prostate cancers. However, the molecular mechanism of genistein in the prevention of human colon cancer remains unclear. Here we attempted to elucidate the anticarcinogenic mechanism of genistein in human colon cancer cells. First we evaluated the growth inhibitory effect of genistein and two other isoflavones, daidzein and biochanin A, on HCT-116 and SW-480 human colon cancer cells. In addition, flow cyto-metry was performed to observe the morphological changes in HCT-116/SW-480 cells undergoing apoptosis or cell cycle arrest, which had been visualized using Annexin V-FITC and/or propidium iodide staining. Real-time PCR and western blot analyses were also employed to study the changes in expression of several important genes associated with cell cycle regulation. Our data showed that genistein, daidzein and biochanin A exhibited growth inhibitory effects on HCT-116/SW-480 colon cancer cells and promoted apoptosis. Genistein showed a significantly greater effect than the other two compounds, in a time- and dose-dependent manner. In addition, genistein caused cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase, which was accompanied by activation of ATM/p53, p21waf1/cip1 and GADD45α as well as downregulation of cdc2 and cdc25A demonstrated by q-PCR and immunoblotting assay. Interestingly, genistein induced G2/M cell cycle arrest in a p53-dependent manner. These findings exemplify that isoflavones, especially genistein, could promote colon cancer cell growth inhibition and facilitate apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase. The ATM/p53-p21 cross-regulatory network may play a crucial role in mediating the anticarcinogenic activities of genistein in colon cancer.""","""['Zhiyu Zhang', 'Chong-Zhi Wang', 'Guang-Jian Du', 'Lian-Wen Qi', 'Tyler Calway', 'Tong-Chuan He', 'Wei Du', 'Chun-Su Yuan']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Int J Oncol""","""['Anti-Colon Cancer Effects of 6-Shogaol Through G2/M Cell Cycle Arrest by p53/p21-cdc2/cdc25A Crosstalk.', 'Bendamustine induces G2 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in myeloma cells: the role of ATM-Chk2-Cdc25A and ATM-p53-p21-pathways.', 'Novel herbal flavonoids promote apoptosis but differentially induce cell cycle arrest in human colon cancer cell.', 'Genistein: A Potent Anti-Breast Cancer Agent.', 'Alkaloids and Colon Cancer: Molecular Mechanisms and Therapeutic Implications for Cell Cycle Arrest.', 'In Vitro Effects of Combining Genistein with Aromatase Inhibitors: Concerns Regarding Its Consumption during Breast Cancer Treatment.', 'The radioprotectant nano-genistein enhances radiotherapy efficacy of lung tumors in mice.', 'Evolution of Natural Product Scaffolds as Potential Proteasome Inhibitors in Developing Cancer Therapeutics.', 'Propolis: A Detailed Insight of Its Anticancer Molecular Mechanisms.', 'Downregulation of Lysosome-Associated Membrane Protein-2A Contributes to the Pathogenesis of COPD.']"""

Materials and methods:   From a cohort of 1,046 men, 159 post-RARP patients by a single surgeon with pathological G8 (N=79) and G9 (N=80) met our inclusion criteria. G9 cancers were sub-stratified into G4+5 (N=58) and G5+4 (N=22). Clinical and pathological outcomes were evaluated with the t test or Mann-Whitney U test for continuous variables and the Pearson χ2 test for categorical variables. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the biochemical recurrence-free survival (BCRFS), and survival curves were compared using the log-rank test. Multivariate analysis was performed with Cox regression analysis.  Results:   Baseline characteristics across all subgroups were similar except for number of positive cores on biopsy. There was a trend toward worse pathological and oncological outcomes in G9 cancers when compared with G8, although only tumor volume (TV), extracapsular extension (ECE) of tumor and lymph nodes involvement (LNI) achieved statistical significance. G4+5 PCa were statistically more likely to have ECE and a higher TV than G4+4 although the BCRFS were not significantly different. G5+4 cancers were associated with a significantly higher proportion of patients with LNI and had a statistically significant poorer BCRFS compared with G4+5 patients.

This is based on a utilitarian objective, being the greatest probability of local tumour control in the population of patients. A numerical simulation is developed and a clinical patient case-mix is used to determine the influence of the characteristics of the patient population on resulting optimal patient scheduling. With the utilitarian objective, large gains in tumour control probability (TCP) can be achieved for individuals or cohorts by prioritizing patients for that fraction of the patient population with relatively small sacrifices in TCP for a smaller fraction of the population. For a waiting list in steady state with five patients per day commencing treatment and leaving the list (and so with five patients per day entering the list), and a mean wait time of 35 days and a maximum of 90 days, optimized wait times ranged from a mean of one day for patients with tumour types with short effective doubling times to a mean of 66.9 days for prostate cancer patients. It is found that, when seeking the optimal daily order of patients on the waiting list in a constrained simulation, the relative rather than absolute value of TCP is the determinant of the resulting optimal waiting times. An increase in the mean waiting time mostly influences (increases) the optimal waiting times of patients with fast-growing tumours. The proportional representation of groups (separated by tumour type) in the patient population has an influence on the resulting distribution of optimal waiting times for patients in those groups, though has only a minor influence on the optimal mean waiting time for each group.""","""['M A Ebert', 'W Li', 'L Jennings', 'R Kearvell', 'S Bydder']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['An analytical solution to patient prioritisation in radiotherapy based on utilitarian optimisation.', 'Prioritization of radiotherapy in Australia and New Zealand.', 'Tumour control probability of stage III inoperable non-small cell lung tumours after sequential chemo-radiotherapy.', 'An audit of delays before and during radical radiotherapy for cervical cancer--effect on tumour cure probability.', 'Radiotherapy waiting time in Northern Nigeria: experience from a resource-limited setting.', 'Operations research for resource planning and -use in radiotherapy: a literature review.']"""

Nominal pencil beam widths (spot sizes) are recorded during treatment planning system commissioning. Due to changes in the beam-line optics, the actual spot sizes may differ from these commissioning values, leading to differences between planned and delivered dose. The purpose of this study was to analyse the dosimetric consequences of spot size variations in particle therapy treatment plans. For 12 patients with skull base tumours and 12 patients with prostate carcinoma, scanned-beam carbon ion and proton treatment plans were prepared and recomputed simulating spot size changes of (1) ±10% to simulate the typical magnitude of fluctuations, (2) ±25% representing the worst-case scenario and (3) ±50% as a part of a risk analysis in case of fault conditions. The primary effect of the spot size variation was a dose deterioration affecting the target edge: loss of target coverage and broadening of the lateral penumbra (increased spot size) or overdosage and contraction of the lateral penumbra (reduced spot size). For changes ≤25%, the resulting planning target volume mean 95%-isodose line coverage (CI-95%) deterioration was ranging from negligible to moderate.

It was later shown in the sixties that 11β-hydroxytestosterone (11OHT) was also produced by the human adrenal. Attention has shifted back to these adrenal androgens once more, as improved analytical techniques have enabled more accurate detection of steroid hormones. In this paper, we investigated the origin of these metabolites as well as their subsequent metabolism and examined a possible physiological role for 11OHA4 in prostate cancer cells. In H295R cells treated with forskolin and trilostane, etomidate, a reported cytochrome P450 11β-hydroxylase (CYP11B1) inhibitor, blocked the production of corticosterone, cortisol, 11OHA4 and 11OHT. The metabolism of androstenedione and testosterone by CYP11B1 and aldosterone synthase (CYP11B2) was assayed. Androstenedione was converted by CYP11B1, while the conversion by CYP11B2 was negligible. Both enzymes readily converted testosterone. The metabolism of these 11β-hydroxylated metabolites by 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11βHSD) types 1 and 2 was subsequently investigated. 11βHSD2 catalyzed the conversion of both 11OHA4 and 11OHT to their respective keto-steroids, while 11βHSD1 catalyzed the conversion of 11-ketoandrostenedione and 11-ketotestosterone to their respective hydroxy-steroids in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Investigating a functional role, steroid 5α-reductase types 1 and 2 converted 11OHA4 to 11β-hydroxy-5α-androstanedione (11OH-5α-dione), identified by accurate mass detection. UPLC-MS/MS analyses of 11OHA4 metabolism in LNCaP androgen-dependent prostate cancer cells, identified the 5α-reduced metabolite as well as 11-ketoandrostenedione and 11-ketotestosterone, with the latter indicating conversion by 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase. Downstream metabolism by 11βHSD2 and by 5α-reductase may therefore indicate a physiological role for 11OHA4 and/or 11OH-5α-dione in normal and prostate cancer cells.""","""['Amanda C Swart', 'Lindie Schloms', 'Karl-Heinz Storbeck', 'Liezl M Bloem', 'Therina du Toit', 'Jonathan L Quanson', 'William E Rainey', 'Pieter Swart']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Steroid Biochem Mol Biol""","""['Profiling adrenal 11β-hydroxyandrostenedione metabolites in prostate cancer cells, tissue and plasma: UPC2-MS/MS quantification of 11β-hydroxytestosterone, 11keto-testosterone and 11keto-dihydrotestosterone.', '11α-Hydroxyprogesterone, a potent 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase inhibitor, is metabolised by steroid-5α-reductase and cytochrome P450 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase to produce C11α-derivatives of 21-deoxycortisol and 11-hydroxyandrostenedione in vitro.', '11β-Hydroxydihydrotestosterone and 11-ketodihydrotestosterone, novel C19 steroids with androgenic activity: a putative role in castration resistant prostate cancer?', 'Pathways and genes involved in steroid hormone metabolism in male pigs: a review and update.', '11β-Hydroxyandrostenedione: Downstream metabolism by 11βHSD, 17βHSD and SRD5A produces novel substrates in familiar pathways.', 'The role of 11-oxygenated androgens in prostate cancer.', 'Advances in the Current Understanding of the Mechanisms Governing the Acquisition of Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Conversion of Classical and 11-Oxygenated Androgens by Insulin-Induced AKR1C3 in a Model of Human PCOS Adipocytes.', 'Molecular Characterization and Functional Analysis of Two Steroidogenic Genes TSPO and SMAD4 in Yellow Catfish.', 'Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasias Presenting in the Newborn and Young Infant.']"""

It was found that both 2-OHE2 and 4-OHE2 have more potent proliferation-enhancing effect than E2. Exposure to 2-OHE2, 4-OHE2 or E2 resulted in a significant increase in the protein abundance of cyclin D1 and c-myc. The treated cells exhibited a shift toward the proliferative phase as indicated by FACScan. BPH-1 cells treated with 4-OHE2 showed increased abundance of estrogen receptor-α (ERα) and its downstream IGF-1R. Reduced abundance of estrogen receptor-β (ERβ) and its downstream tumor suppressor FOXO-1 were observed in cells exposed to E2, 2-OHE2 and, to a greater extent, 4-OHE2. Comet assay revealed that CE, especially 4-OHE2, elicited significant genotoxic effects as compared to E2. 4-OHE2 showed greater ability to neoplastically transform BPH-1 cells as indicated by increased colony forming capacity in soft agar and matrix invasion. In conclusion, in vitro exposure to CE could neoplastically transform human prostatic epithelial cells.

We sought to determine whether the Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) and hypertension (HTN) are associated with overall survival (OS) independent of known clinical prognostic factors in mCRPC.  Patients and methods:   A retrospective analysis was conducted on 221 patients with mCRPC treated with docetaxel plus prednisone combined with AT-101 (bcl-2 antagonist) or placebo on a prospective randomized phase II trial. The Cox regression analysis was performed to identify whether the CCI or HTN or both (by medical history) independently predicted OS after adjusting for baseline variables known to be associated with OS. The Wilcoxon rank sum test and the Fisher exact test were used to compare data by comorbidity groups (CCI as a continuous variable, CCI = 6 vs. CCI ≥ 7 and HTN vs. no HTN).  Results:   The CCI was 6 in 116 patients (52.7%), 7 in 70 (31.8%), 8 in 23 (10.5%), 9 in 4 (1.8%), and 10 in 7 patients (3.2%). HTN was present in 107 (48.6%) patients. Patients with CCI of ≥ 7 were older and exhibited worse performance status and anemia than patients with CCI of 6 (P<0.05). The CCI was not independently predictive of OS on univariable and multivariable analyses. HTN alone or in combination with the CCI was borderline significantly associated with OS (P ~ 0.09) on both univariable and multivariable analyses.  Conclusions:   The CCI did not predict OS independent of known prognostic factors in mCRPC. Age, performance status, and anemia may adequately capture comorbidities in the context of mCRPC, given their association with higher CCI. Further prospective study of comorbidities in a larger data set may be warranted. The study of HTN in a larger data set may also be warranted given its borderline-independent association with OS.""","""['Jatinder Goyal', 'Gregory R Pond', 'Matthew D Galsky', 'Ryan Hendricks', 'Alexander Small', 'Che-Kai Tsao', 'Guru Sonpavde']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Efficacy of docetaxel-based chemotherapy following ketoconazole in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: implications for prior therapy in clinical trials.', 'Ability of C-reactive protein to complement multiple prognostic classifiers in men with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer receiving docetaxel-based chemotherapy.', 'Neutropenia as a potential pharmacodynamic marker for docetaxel-based chemotherapy in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: changing landscape with cabazitaxel.', 'Anemia is associated with poor outcomes of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, a systematic review and meta-analysis.', ""Can HALP score, a new prognostic tool, take the place of traditional scoring systems in Fournier's gangrene?"", 'Real-world comparison of Docetaxel versus new hormonal agents in combination with androgen-deprivation therapy in metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer descrying PSA Nadir\u2009≤\u20090.05\xa0ng/ml as marker for treatment response.', 'Adherence to Oral Treatments in Older Patients with Advanced Prostate Cancer, the ADHERE Study: A Prospective Trial of the Meet-URO Network.', 'A drug comorbidity index to predict mortality in men with castration resistant prostate cancer.', 'Treatment-Emergent Co-Morbidities and Survival in Patients With Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Receiving Abiraterone or Enzalutamide.']"""

Methods and materials:   We performed a single institution retrospective study comparing all 311 patients who received 74 Gy without fiducial markers in 2006 versus all 243 patients who received our updated regimen of 78 Gy with FMIGRT in 2008. Patient records were reviewed 27 months after completing radiotherapy. Biochemical failure was defined using the Phoenix definition. Details of late gastrointestinal and genitourinary toxicities were graded according to CTCAEv4. Moderate/severe toxicity was defined as a grade 2 or higher toxicity. Cumulative incidence and prevalence curves for moderate/severe toxicity were constructed and compared using multistate modeling while biochemical failure free survival was compared using the log rank test. A Cox regression model was developed to correct for confounding factors.  Results:   Median follow-up time for both groups was 22 months. The hazard ratio for moderate/severe late gastrointestinal toxicity in the non-FMIGRT group was 3.66 [95% CI (1.63-8.23), p=0.003] compared to patients in the FMIGRT group. There was no difference in the hazard ratio of moderate/severe late genitourinary toxicity between the two groups (0.44 [95% CI (0.19-1.00)]), but patients treated with FMIGRT did have a quicker recovery from their genitourinary toxicities HR=0.24 [95% CI (0.10-0.59)]. We were unable to detect any differences in biochemical failure free survival between the cohorts HR=0.60 [95% CI (0.30-1.20), p=0.143].

The aim of the present abstract and video is to detail our experience in the surgical management of a specific patient with a locally advanced symptomatic recurrence of penile sarcoma secondary to prostate cancer treated with primary brachytherapy.  Materials and methods:   A 70 year old male patient initially treated for localized prostate cancer with interstitial brachytherapy at an outside facility developed an unfortunate secondary malignancy consisting of a locally advanced penile sarcoma involving as well the prostate and base of the bladder. Despite our best efforts to control his pain, he developed a very symptomatic local recurrence with a secondary penile abscess and purulent periurethral drainage. At this time, it was felt a surgical resection consisting of a total penectomy, urethrectomy, cystoprostatectomy, and ileal conduit urinary diversion would be the best option for local cancer control in this particular patient.  Results:   The patient underwent the surgical resection without any complications as illustrated in this surgical video, with a jejunal intestinal mass identified at the time of surgery which was resected with a primary bowel anastomosis performed. The patient was discharged from hospital uneventfully with his symptomatic local recurrence being successfully managed and the patient no longer requiring oral narcotics for pain control. The pathological report confirmed a locally advanced sarcoma involving the penile, prostate, and bladder which was resected with negative surgical margins and the jejunal mass was confirmed to represent a small bowel sarcoma metastatic site.  Conclusion:   As highlighted in the present video, the treatment of a symptomatic sarcoma local recurrence contiguously involving the penis can be successfully managed provided the patient is informed of the potential morbidity and psychosocial implications imparted by performing a total penectomy and adjacent organ resection.""","""['Tariq S Hakky', 'Patrick Espiritu', 'Alejandro R Rodriguez', 'Nicholas Gould', 'Philippe E Spiess']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Int Braz J Urol""","""['Re-resection with brachytherapy for locally recurrent soft tissue sarcoma arising in a previously radiated field.', 'Palliative radiation therapy of symptomatic recurrent bladder cancer.', 'Management of soft tissue sarcomas in first isolated local recurrence: a retrospective study of 83 cases.', 'The role of high-dose rate brachytherapy in locally advanced prostate cancer.', 'Penile metastasis from primary bladder cancer: a study of 8 cases and review of the literature.']"""

However, this association is still incompletely understood and the results are divisive. The aim of this study was to analyze testosterone as a predictor of aggressive disease in subjects with clinically localized PCa.  Materials and methods:   A cohort was conducted including the patients submitted to radical prostatectomy in our institution during a period of four years. The patients had clinically localized disease and their total testosterone (TT) was routinely measured preoperatively in the morning before surgery. They were stratified in groups with low (< 300 ng/dL) and normal TT (≥ 300 ng/dL). Tumor aggressiveness was inferred based on preoperative PSA levels, pathological Gleason score (lower, equal or greater than 7), TNM stage and surgical margins status.  Results:   After analyzing 164 patients we found a significant association between mean preoperative TT and extraprostatic disease (379 for pT3 vs. 421 ng/for pT2 - p < 0.001, AUC > 0.99). Conversely, men with high Gleason score had similar mean TT compared to those with lower scores. Preoperative low TT (defined as TT < 300 ng/dL) could not be statistically correlated with either preoperative PSA levels, pathological Gleason score, extraprostatic extension, positive surgical margins or seminal vesicles involvement.  Conclusions:   This study indicates that testosterone may be a useful predictive tool once pathological extraprostatic extension was somewhat signaled by lower TT levels preoperatively. However, it does not consolidate a clear association between aggressive tumor biology and hypogonadism.""","""['Pedro Henrique Oliveira Cabral', 'Marcelo Wassano Iwamoto', 'Victor Silvestre Soares Fanni', 'Luciano da Rocha Barros', 'Sandro Nassar Cardoso', 'Luiz Figueiredo Mello', 'Sidney Glina']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Int Braz J Urol""","""['Low pretreatment serum total testosterone is associated with a high incidence of Gleason score 8-10 disease in prostatectomy specimens: data from ethnic Chinese patients with localized prostate cancer.', 'Low serum testosterone levels are associated with positive surgical margins in radical retropubic prostatectomy: hypogonadism represents bad prognosis in prostate cancer.', 'Impact of positive surgical margins on prostate-specific antigen failure after radical prostatectomy in adjuvant treatment-naïve patients.', 'Behavior of total and free serum testosterone as a predictor for the risk of prostate cancer and its aggressiveness.', 'Influence of plasmatic testosterone during natural history of prostate cancer: a review.', 'Serum testosterone and prostate cancer in men with germline BRCA1/2 pathogenic variants.', 'Post Radical Prostatectomy Erectile Dysfunction.

Objective:   To evaluate the ability of a panel of four kallikrein markers in blood-total prostate-specific antigen (PSA), free PSA, intact PSA, and kallikrein-related peptidase 2-to distinguish between pathologically insignificant and aggressive disease on pathologic examination of radical prostatectomy (RP) specimens as well as to calculate the number of avoidable surgeries.  Design, setting, and participants:   The cohort comprised 392 screened men participating in rounds 1 and 2 of the Rotterdam arm of the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer. Patients were diagnosed with PCa because of an elevated PSA ≥3.0 ng/ml and were treated with RP between 1994 and 2004.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   We calculated the accuracy (area under the curve [AUC]) of statistical models to predict pathologically aggressive PCa (pT3-T4, extracapsular extension, tumor volume >0.5cm(3), or any Gleason grade ≥4) based on clinical predictors (age, stage, PSA, biopsy findings) with and without levels of four kallikrein markers in blood.  Results and limitations:   A total of 261 patients (67%) had significant disease on pathologic evaluation of the RP specimen. While the clinical model had good accuracy in predicting aggressive disease, reflected in a corrected AUC of 0.81, the four kallikrein markers enhanced the base model, with an AUC of 0.84 (p < 0.0005). The model retained its ability in patients with low-risk and very-low-risk disease and in comparison with the Steyerberg nomogram, a published prediction model. Clinical application of the model incorporating the kallikrein markers would reduce rates of surgery by 135 of 1000 patients overall and 110 of 334 patients with pathologically insignificant disease. A limitation of the present study is that clinicians may be hesitant to make recommendations against active treatment on the basis of a statistical model.  Conclusions:   Our study provided proof of principle that predictions based on levels of four kallikrein markers in blood distinguish between pathologically insignificant and aggressive disease after RP with good accuracy.

One of these, miR-21, contributes to carcinogenesis in prostate and other cancers. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that NADPH oxidase-dependent reactive oxygen species (ROS) regulate the expression and function of miR-21 and its target proteins, maspin and programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4), in prostate cancer cells.  Results:   The highly aggressive androgen receptor negative PC-3M-MM2 prostate cancer cells demonstrated high expression of miR-21 and p47(phox) (an essential subunit of NADPH oxidase). Using loss-of-function strategy, we showed that transfection of PC-3M-MM2 cells with anti-miR-21- and p47(phox) siRNA (si-p47(phox)) led to reduced expression of miR-21 with concurrent increase in maspin and PDCD4, and decreased the invasiveness of the cells. Tail-vein injections of anti-miR-21- and si-p47(phox)-transfected PC-3M-MM2 cells in severe combined immunodeficient mice reduced lung metastases. Clinical samples from patients with advanced prostate cancer expressed high levels of miR-21 and p47(phox), and low expression of maspin and PDCD4. Finally, ROS activated Akt in these cells, the inhibition of which reduced miR-21 expression.  Innovation:   The levels of NADPH oxidase-derived ROS are high in prostate cancer cells, which have been shown to be involved in their growth and migration. This study demonstrates that ROS produced by this pathway is essential for the expression and function of an onco-miR, miR-21, in androgen receptor-negative prostate cancer cells.

However, some patients do not benefit, and those tumors that do initially respond to ADT eventually progress. One recently described mechanism of such an effect is growth and survival-promoting effects of the AR that are exerted independently of the AR ligands, testosterone and dihydrotestosterone. However, specific ligand-independent AR target genes that account for this effect were not well characterized. We show here that c-Myc, which is a key mediator of ligand-independent prostate cancer growth, is a key ligand-independent AR target gene. Using microarray analysis, we found that c-Myc and AR expression levels strongly correlated with each other in tumors from patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) progressing despite ADT. We confirmed that AR directly regulates c-Myc transcription in a ligand-independent manner, that AR and c-Myc suppression reduces ligand-independent prostate cancer cell growth, and that ectopic expression of c-Myc attenuates the anti-growth effects of AR suppression. Importantly, treatment with the bromodomain inhibitor JQ1 suppressed c-Myc function and suppressed ligand-independent prostate cancer cell survival.

ZOL has also demonstrated anticancer activities in preclinical models and, recently, in cancer patients, highlighting the interest in determining eventual mechanisms of resistance against this agent. In our study, we selected and characterised a resistant subline of prostate cancer (PCa) cells to better understand the mechanisms, by which tumour cells can escape the antitumour effect of ZOL. DU145R80-resistant cells were selected in about 5 months using stepwise increasing concentrations of ZOL from DU145 parental cells. DU145R80 cells showed a resistance index value of 5.5 and cross-resistance to another N-BP, pamidronate, but not to the non-nitrogen containing BP clodronate. Notably, compared with DU145 parental cells, DU145R80 developed resistance to apoptosis and anoikis, as well as overexpressed the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and oncoprotein c-Myc. Moreover, DU145R80 cells underwent epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and showed increased expression of the metalloproteases MMP-2/9, as well as increased invading capability. Interestingly, compared with DU145, DU145R80 cells also increased the gene expression and protein secretion of VEGF and the cytokines Eotaxin-1 and IL-12. At the molecular level, DU145R80 cells showed strong activation of the p38-MAPK-dependent survival pathway compared with parental sensitive cells. Moreover, using the p38-inhibitor SB203580, we completely reversed the resistance to ZOL, as well as EMT marker expression and invasion. Furthermore, SB203580 treatment reduced the expression of VEGF, Eotaxin-1, IL-12, MMP-9, Bcl-2 and c-Myc. Thus, for the first time, we demonstrate that the p38-MAPK pathway can be activated under continuous extensive exposure to ZOL in PCa cells and that the p38-MAPK pathway has a critical role in the induction of resistance, as well as in the acquisition of a more aggressive and invasive phenotype.""","""['M R Milone', 'B Pucci', 'F Bruzzese', 'C Carbone', 'G Piro', 'S Costantini', 'F Capone', 'A Leone', 'E Di Gennaro', 'M Caraglia', 'A Budillon']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Cell Death Dis""","""['Annexin A1 is involved in the acquisition and maintenance of a stem cell-like/aggressive phenotype in prostate cancer cells with acquired resistance to zoledronic acid.', 'Panobinostat synergizes with zoledronic acid in prostate cancer and multiple myeloma models by increasing ROS and modulating mevalonate and p38-MAPK pathways.', 'Inhibition of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase alters microRNA expression and reverses epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition.', 'Zoledronic acid - a multiplicity of anti-cancer action.', 'The new bisphosphonate, Zometa (zoledronic acid), decreases skeletal complications in both osteolytic and osteoblastic lesions: a comparison to pamidronate.', 'Natriuretic Peptides Regulate Prostate Cells Inflammatory Behavior: Potential Novel Anticancer Agents for Prostate Cancer.', 'Sonic hedgehog signaling is associated with resistance to zoledronic acid in CD133high/CD44high prostate cancer stem cells.', 'Targeting Histone Modifications in Bone and Lung Metastatic Cancers.', 'Synergistic antitumor interaction of valproic acid and simvastatin sensitizes prostate cancer to docetaxel by targeting CSCs compartment via YAP inhibition.', 'Integrated Analysis to Study the Relationship between Tumor-Associated Selenoproteins: Focus on Prostate Cancer.']"""

Tumours range from insignificant and not life threatening to high risk for relapse ones. Consequently, a large number of patients undergo unnecessary treatment. miR-145 is a well-documented tumour suppressor and its expression, which is regulated by the p53 pathway, has been found to be decreased in the majority of human malignancies. The aim of our study was to evaluate the clinical utility of miR-145 for the prognostication of PCa.  Methods:   Total RNA was isolated from 137 prostate tissue specimens obtained from 73 radical prostatectomy-treated PCa patients and 64 transurethral- or open prostatectomy-treated benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) patients. Following polyadenylation and reverse transcription, miR-145 levels were determined by quantitative real-time PCR assay, using SNORD48 (RNU48) for normalisation purposes.  Results:   Downregulated miR-145 expression was found in PCa compared with BPH patients. The reduction of miR-145 expression in PCa was correlated with higher Gleason score, advanced clinical stage, larger tumour diameter and higher prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and follow-up PSA levels. In addition, higher risk for biochemical recurrence and significantly shorter disease-free survival (DFS) was found for the PCa patients expressing lower miR-145. Focusing on 'low- and intermediate-recurrence risk' PCa patients, miR-145 loss was revealed to be a reliable predictor of biochemical relapse and poor DFS independent from Gleason score, clinical stage, PSA and patients' age.

This study investigates the association between levels of serum folate and prostate-specific antigen (PSA), a biomarker for prostate cancer detection.  Methods:   Using data from the 2007 to 2010 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a total of 3,293 men aged 40 years and older with serum PSA and folate measures were studied. Total PSA level (tPSA) and percent free/total PSA ratio (%fPSA) were major outcomes. The alternative cutpoints were used to categorize these measures as higher risks of prostate cancer (tPSA: ≥10, ≥4, and ≥2.5 ng/ml; %fPSA: ≤15 and ≤5 %). Serum folate level was analyzed as continuous and as quintiles. Association between serum folate and PSA levels were evaluated by multivariate linear and logistic regressions.  Results:   Higher serum folate levels were associated with decreased log10-transformed tPSA (β = -001, p = 0.061) and increased %fPSA (β = 0.064, p = 0.012). Adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, body mass index, and smoking status, higher serum folate (fifth quintile) was associated with lower odds of having higher tPSA (≥10 ng/ml) and lower %fPSA (≤25 %): (tPSA: odds ratio, OR associated with fifth to first quintile of folate level = 0.42; 95 % confidence interval, CI = 0.21, 0.83; p for trend = 0.022 and %fPSA: OR = 0.71; 95 % CI = 0.52, 0.95; p for trend = 0.044).

Methods:   We analyzed data from the SEER database (1973-2009). We compared EBRT versus no radiotherapy. Incidence rate ratios (IRR) and 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CI) of mesothelioma among prostate cancer patients were estimated with multilevel Poisson models adjusted by race, age, and calendar year. Confounding by asbestos was investigated using relative risk of mesothelioma in each case's county of residence as a proxy for asbestos exposure.  Results:   Four hundred and seventy-one mesothelioma cases (93.6 % pleural) occurred in 3,985,991 person-years. The IRR of mesothelioma was increased for subjects exposed to EBRT (1.28; 95 % CI 1.05, 1.55) compared to non-irradiated patients, and a population attributable fraction of 0.49 % (95 % CI 0.11, 0.81) was estimated.

The majority occurs in the gastrointestinal tract.  Aim:   To analyze the demographic factors, clinicopathologic features, treatment employed, prognostic factors and the oncologic results related to colorectal NETs.  Methods:   Between the period from 1996 to 2010 174 patients were treated. From these, 34 were localized in the colon and rectum. Demographic factors, stage, therapeutics and its results were analyzed. All patients were followed for more than three years with image exams, urinary 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid (5-HIIA), serum chromogranin A and prostatic acid phosphatase.  Results:   The median age was 54,4 years (22-76), the majority was female (64,7%). Out of the 12 patients with colon NETs, one (8.3%) patient was classified as Stage IA; one (8.3%) as Stage IB; three (25%) as Stage IIIB and seven (58.4%) as Stage IV. Out of the 22 patients with rectum NETs, six (27.3%) were classified as Stage IA; four (18.2%) as IB; three (13.6 %) as IIIA; one (4.5%) as IIIB and eight (36.4%) as IV. Of rectal NETs, nine (41%) were treated with endoscopic resection, six (27.2%) underwent conventional surgical treatment and six (27.2%) were treated with chemotherapy. Eleven patients with colon NETs (91.6%) were surgically treated, seven of them with palliative surgery, one (8.4%) was treated with endoscopic resection and no patient was submitted to chemotherapy. After an average follow-up of 55 months, 19 (55%) patients were alive. Analyzing the overall survival was obtained an average overall survival of 29 months in Stage IA, 62 months in IB, 12 months in IIIA, 31 months in IIIB and 39 months in IV.  Conclusion:   The treatment of colon and rectal NETs is complex, because it depends of the individuality of each patient.

Using androgen-deprived LNCaP cells, in which ERK1/2 activation occurs in strong correlation with AKT activation, we found that AKT-mediated B-Raf regulation is necessary for ERK1/2 activation. Specifically, in response to androgen deprivation, AKT upregulated B-Raf phosphorylation at Ser445 without affecting A-Raf or C-Raf-1. This effect of AKT was abolished by Arg25 to Ala mutation or truncating (∆4-129) the pleckstrin homology domain of AKT, indicating that the canonical AKT regulation is important for this signaling. Intriguingly, although a constitutively active AKT containing N-terminal myristoylation signal could sufficiently upregulate B-Raf phosphorylation at Ser445 in LNCaP cells, subsequent MEK/ERK activation still required hormone deprivation. In contrast, AKT activity was sufficient to induce not only B-Raf phosphorylation but also MEK/ERK activation in the hormone refractory LNCaP variant, C4-2. These data indicate that androgen depletion may induce MEK/ERK activation through a synergy between AKT-dependent and -independent mechanisms and that the latter may become deregulated in association with castration resistance. In support, consistent AKT-mediated B-Raf regulation was also detected in a panel of PCa lines derived from the cPten(-/-)L mice before and after castration. Our results also demonstrate that AKT regulates androgen receptor levels partly via the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway.

The results of two variants of block bootstrapping are compared with a parametric approximation based on the assumption of a Gaussian distribution of the numbers of points in deterministic subwindows of the original pattern. The studies were performed on patterns obtained by simulation of well-known point process models (Poisson process, two Matérn cluster processes, Matérn hardcore process, Strauss hardcore process). They were also performed on real histopathological data (point patterns of capillary profiles of 12 cases of prostatic cancer).

The co-existence of hormone responsive and irresponsive cells due to functional androgen receptor (AR) in prostate gland is the major obstacle in prostate cancer therapy models. Targeting aberrant cell cycle by novel cell cycle blocking agents is a promising strategy to treat various types of malignancies. Purvalanol and roscovitine are cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors able to activate apoptotic cell death by inducing cell cycle arrest at G1/S and G2/M phases in cancer cells. Polyamines are unique cationic amine derivatives involved in the regulation of cell proliferation. Although the elevated intracellular level of polyamines (putrescine, spermidine and spermine) is typical for prostate gland, abnormal regulation of polyamine metabolism might result in rapid cell proliferation and, thus in prostate cancer progression. Therefore, treatment with drug-induced depletion of intracellular polyamine levels through the activated polyamine catabolism is critical to achieve successful strategies for prostate cancer. In this study we aimed to investigate the apoptotic efficiency of CDK inhibitors in three prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP, DU145 and PC3), showing different AR expression profile. We found that both purvalanol and roscovitine were able to induce apoptosis at moderate cytotoxic concentrations by decreasing mitochondria membrane potential. The apoptotic effect of both CDK inhibitors was due to activation of caspases by modulating Bcl-2 family members. The efficiency of drugs was quite similar on the three prostate cell lines used in this study. However, DU145 cells were found the least sensitive against CDK inhibitors while purvalanol was more potent than roscovitine. Similarly to classical chemotherapeutic agents, both drugs could up-regulate polyamine catabolic enzymes (SSAT, SMO and PAO) in cell type dependent manner. Transient silencing of SSAT and/or inhibition of PAO/ SMO with MDL72527 prevented CDK inhibitors- induced apoptotic cell death in DU145 and PC3 cells. Although roscovitine was less effective in DU145 cells, pre-treatment with α-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), an inhibitor of ODC, enhanced the roscovitine-induced apoptotic cell death through the cleavage of caspase-9 and caspase-3. Therefore, we conclude that polyamine catabolism might have essential role in the cellular responses against CDK inhibitors in different androgen-responsive or irresponsive prostate cancer cells.""","""['Elif Damla Arisan', 'Pinar Obakan', 'Ajda Coker-Gurkan', 'Annarica Calcabrini', 'Enzo Agostinelli', 'Narcin Palavan Unsal']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Curr Pharm Des""","""['mTOR is a fine tuning molecule in CDK inhibitors-induced distinct cell death mechanisms via PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling axis in prostate cancer cells.', 'Inhibition of polyamine oxidase prevented cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor-induced apoptosis in HCT 116 colon carcinoma cells.', 'Silencing of the polyamine catabolic key enzyme SSAT prevents CDK inhibitor-induced apoptosis in Caco-2 colon cancer cells.', 'Dual action of the inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases: targeting of the cell-cycle progression and activation of wild-type p53 protein.', 'AR, the cell cycle, and prostate cancer.', 'A new 68Ga-labeled ornithine derivative for PET imaging of ornithine metabolism in tumors.', 'Cordycepin enhances radiosensitivity to induce apoptosis through cell cycle arrest, caspase pathway and ER stress in MA-10 mouse Leydig tumor cells.', 'The First Insight Into the Supramolecular System of D,L-α-Difluoromethylornithine: A New Antiviral Perspective.', 'CDK9: A Comprehensive Review of Its Biology, and Its Role as a Potential Target for Anti-Cancer Agents.', 'The Emerging Clinical Role of Spermine in Prostate Cancer.']"""

A series of recombinant proteins were prepared, and then, the male C57BL/6 mice were immunized subcutaneously by inoculation with RM-PSCA/Luc cells. The PSCA-specific cellular immune responses were monitored with ELISPOT and intracellular cytokines staining assay, and ELISA assay was used to detect humoral immune responses. The tumor growth was observed by in vivo bioluminescence imaging. The results showed that the mice vaccinated with PSCA-HSP could induce the PSCA-specific cellular and humoral immune responses. Tumor progression could be quantitatively monitored by in vivo bioluminescence imaging.

Despite all the progresses made in cancer prevention, diagnosis and treatment, mortality by cancer is on the second place after the one caused by cardiovascular diseases. The high mortality and the increasing incidence of certain cancers (lung, prostate, colorectal) justify a growing interest for the identification of new pharmacological agents efficient in cancer prevention and treatment. In the last fifty years many plant-derived agents (vinblastine, vincristine, vindesine, paclitaxel, docetaxel, topotecan, irinotecan, elliptinium) played a major role in cancer treatment. Other very promising plant-derived anticancer agents (combrestatins, betulinic acid, roscovitine, purvalanols, indirubins) are in clinical or preclinical trials. Curcumin, a liposoluble polyphenolic pigment isolated from the rhizomes of Curcuma longa L. (Zingiberaceae), is another potential candidate for new anticancer drug development. Curcumin has been reported to influence many cell-signaling pathways involved in tumor initiation and proliferation. Curcumin inhibits COX-2 activity, cyclin D1 and MMPs overexpresion, NF-kB, STAT and TNF-alpha signaling pathways and regulates the expression of p53 tumor suppressing gene. Curcumin is well-tolerated but has a reduced systemic bioavailability. Polycurcumins (PCurc 8) and curcumin encapsulated in biodegradable polymeric nanoparticles (NanoCurc) showed higher bioavailability than curcumin together with a significant tumor growth inhibition in both in vitro and in vivo studies.

LNCaP cells stably expressing NF-κB2/p52 exhibited higher survival rates than controls when treated with enzalutamide. C4-2B and CWR22Rv1 cells chronically treated with enzalutamide were found to express higher levels of NF-κB2/p52.

Analysis of the expression levels of AR splice variants by quantitative reverse transcription PCR and Western blotting revealed that LNCaP cells expressing p52 exhibit higher expression of AR splice variants. Downregulation of expression of NF-κB2/p52 in VCaP and CWR22Rv1 cells by short hairpin RNA abolished expression of splice variants. Downregulation of expression of either full-length AR or the splice variant AR-V7 led to an increase in sensitivity of prostate cancer cells to enzalutamide.

Sarcosine was quantified using high-throughput liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. A significantly increased risk of prostate cancer was observed with increasing levels of sarcosine (odds ratio [OR] for the highest quartile of exposure [Q4] versus the lowest quartile [Q1] = 1.30, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.02, 1.65; P-trend 0.03). When stratified by disease aggressiveness, we observed a stronger association for non-aggressive cases (OR for Q4 versus Q1 = 1.44, 95% CI: 1.11, 1.88; P-trend 0.006) but no association for aggressive prostate cancer (OR for Q4 versus Q1 = 1.03, 95% CI: 0.73, 1.47; P-trend 0.89). Although not statistically significant, temporal analyses showed a stronger association between sarcosine and prostate cancer for serum collected closer to diagnosis, suggesting that sarcosine may be an early biomarker of disease. Interestingly, the association between sarcosine and prostate cancer risk was stronger among men with diabetes (OR = 2.66, 95% CI: 1.04, 6.84) compared with those without reported diabetes (OR = 1.23, 95% CI: 0.95-1.59, P-interaction = 0.01).

Bone remodeling is orchestrated by the molecular triad RANK-RANKL-OPG. This process is dysregulated in bone metastases, mostly via induction of RANKL by tumor-derived factors. These factors increase expression of RANKL, which induce osteoclast formation, function, and survival, thereby increasing bone resorption. RANK is unexpectedly expressed by cancer cells, and the activation of RANKL-RANK pathway correlates with an increased invasive phenotype. To investigate the interaction between RANK expression in human breast and prostate cancer cells and their pro-metastatic phenotype we analyzed the activation of RANKL-RANK pathway and its effects on cell migration, invasion, gene expression in vitro, and osteolysis-inducing ability in vivo. RANKL activates kinase signaling pathways, stimulates cell migration, increases cell invasion, and up-regulates MMP-1 expression. In vivo, MMP-1 knockdown resulted in smaller x-ray osteolytic lesions and osteoclastogenesis, and decreased tumor burden. Therefore, RANKL inhibition in bone metastatic disease may decrease the levels of the osteoclastogenesis inducer MMP-1, contributing to a better clinical outcome.""","""['Sandra Casimiro', 'Khalid S Mohammad', 'Ricardo Pires', 'Joana Tato-Costa', 'Irina Alho', 'Rui Teixeira', 'António Carvalho', 'Sofia Ribeiro', 'Allan Lipton', 'Theresa A Guise', 'Luis Costa']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['RANKL acts directly on RANK-expressing prostate tumor cells and mediates migration and expression of tumor metastasis genes.', 'Expression profile of receptor activator of nuclear-κB (RANK), RANK ligand (RANKL) and osteoprotegerin (OPG) in breast cancer.', 'Differential expression of the RANKL/RANK/OPG system is associated with bone metastasis in human non-small cell lung cancer.', 'RANKL/RANK/OPG system beyond bone remodeling: involvement in breast cancer and clinical perspectives.', 'Receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa B ligand (RANKL) stimulates bone-associated tumors through functional RANK expressed on bone-associated cancer cells?', 'Effects of Epigallocatechin-3-Gallate on Matrix Metalloproteinases in Terms of Its Anticancer Activity.', 'Exploring new pathways in endocrine-resistant breast cancer.', 'The Signaling Pathways Associated With Breast Cancer Bone Metastasis.', 'Capecitabine inhibits epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and proliferation of colorectal cancer cells by mediating the RANK/RANKL pathway.', 'Molecular Mechanisms Leading from Periodontal Disease to Cancer.']"""

We have recently shown that testosterone exerts proapoptotic effects in prostate and colon cancer cells through a membrane-initiated mechanism. In addition, we have recently reported that dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) can control cell fate, activating nerve growth factor (NGF) receptors, namely tropomyosin-related kinase (Trk)A and p75 neurotrophin receptor, in primary neurons and in PC12 tumoral cells. NGF was recently involved in cancer cell proliferation and apoptosis. In the present study, we explored the cross talk between androgens (testosterone and DHEA) and NGF in regulating apoptosis of prostate and colon cancer cells. DHEA and NGF strongly blunted serum deprivation-induced apoptosis, whereas testosterone induced apoptosis of both cancer cell lines. The antiapoptotic effect of both DHEA and NGF was completely reversed by testosterone. In line with this, DHEA or NGF up-regulated, whereas testosterone down-regulated, the expression of TrkA receptor. The effects of androgens were abolished in both cell lines in the presence of TrkA inhibitor. DHEA induced the phosphorylation of TrkA and the interaction of p75 neurotrophin receptor with its effectors, Rho protein GDP dissociation inhibitor and receptor interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 2. Conversely, testosterone was unable to activate both receptors. Testosterone acted as a DHEA and NGF antagonist, by blocking the activation of both receptors by DHEA or NGF.

We report on the prognostic value of phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) loss in a cohort of 675 men with conservatively managed prostate cancer diagnosed by transurethral resection of the prostate.  Methods:   The PTEN status was assayed by immunohistochemistry (PTEN IHC) and fluorescent in situ hybridisation (PTEN FISH). The primary end point was death from prostate cancer.  Results:   The PTEN IHC loss was observed in 18% cases. This was significantly associated with prostate cancer death in univariate analysis (hazard ratio (HR)=3.51; 95% CI 2.60-4.73; P=3.1 × 10(-14)). It was highly predictive of prostate cancer death in the 50% of patients with a low risk score based on Gleason score, PSA, Ki-67 and extent of disease (HR=7.4; 95% CI 2.2-24.6; P=0.012) ), but had no prognostic value in the higher risk patients. The PTEN FISH loss was only weakly associated with PTEN IHC loss (κ=0.5). Both PTEN FISH loss and amplification were univariately predictive of death from prostate cancer, but this was not maintained in the multivariate analyses.  Conclusion:   In low-risk patients, PTEN IHC loss adds prognostic value to Gleason score, PSA, Ki-67 and extent of disease.""","""['J Cuzick', 'Z H Yang', 'G Fisher', 'E Tikishvili', 'S Stone', 'J S Lanchbury', 'N Camacho', 'S Merson', 'D Brewer', 'C S Cooper', 'J Clark', 'D M Berney', 'H Møller', 'P Scardino', 'Z Sangale;Transatlantic Prostate Group']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Br J Cancer""","""['ERG rearrangement is associated with prostate cancer-related death in Chinese prostate cancer patients.', 'Loss of PTEN Expression Detected by Fluorescence Immunohistochemistry Predicts Lethal Prostate Cancer in Men Treated with Prostatectomy.', 'A multicenter study shows PTEN deletion is strongly associated with seminal vesicle involvement and extracapsular extension in localized prostate cancer.', 'Which, when and why?

Here, we found that RB significantly inhibited activity of topoisomerase IIα (Topo IIα), leading to remarkable DNA damage in prostate cancer (PCa) cells as evidenced by a strong induction of γH2AX and DNA fragmentation. Activation of ATM and ATR sequentially led to induction of phospho-Chk1/2 and phospho-Cdc25 in response to RB. Blockade of ATM/ATR signaling resulted in the attenuation of RB-induced γH2AX, and partially rescued RB-mediated cell death. RB treatment also resulted in inactivation of DNA repair proteins such as phospho-BRCA1, impairment of HR, and NHEJ repair as indicated by DNA end-joining assays. Meanwhile, a stress-responsive gene activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) was noted for its predominant expression in response to RB-induced DNA damage. Knockdown of ATF3 inhibited the RB-induced expression changes of cell cycle- and apoptosis-related genes such as DR5, DDIT4, CDC25A, GADD45A, and partially blocked RB-mediated inhibition on cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis, suggesting the crucial involvement of ATF3 in this event. Microarray data displayed that RB caused changes of genes required for damaged-DNA binding and repair, as well as ATF3 and its target genes. Our data firstly demonstrated that RB was a novel DNA Topo II inhibitor and triggered cell death by inducing DNA damage and stress-response, suggesting a promising anticancer agent.""","""['Yongqing Liu', 'Fengbin Gao', 'Hanming Jiang', 'Leilei Niu', 'Yiling Bi', 'Charles Y F Young', 'Huiqing Yuan', 'Hongxiang Lou']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Cancer Lett""","""['A novel anticancer agent, retigeric acid B, displays proliferation inhibition, S phase arrest and apoptosis activation in human prostate cancer cells.', 'A novel small molecule hybrid of vorinostat and DACA displays anticancer activity against human hormone-refractory metastatic prostate cancer through dual inhibition of histone deacetylase and topoisomerase I.', 'The catalytic topoisomerase II inhibitor dexrazoxane induces DNA breaks, ATF3 and the DNA damage response in cancer cells.', 'Cytotoxic signalling by inhibitors of DNA topoisomerase II.', 'Role of activating transcription factor 3 and its interacting proteins under physiological and pathological conditions.', 'DDIT4 Facilitates Lymph Node Metastasis via the Activation of NF-κB Pathway and Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition.', 'The Effect of Surface-Modified Gold Nanorods on the Early Stage of Embryonic Development and Angiogenesis: Insight into the Molecular Pathways.', 'ASC-J9® suppresses prostate cancer cell proliferation and invasion via altering the ATF3-PTK2 signaling.', 'ATF3 inhibits the tumorigenesis and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma cells via upregulation of CYR61 expression.', 'Activating Transcription Factor 3 as a Novel Regulator of Chemotherapy Response in Breast Cancer.']"""

G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRK) directly regulate GPCR activity by phosphorylating activated agonist-bound receptors to desensitize signaling and internalize receptors through beta-arrestins. Recent studies in various cancers, including prostate and breast cancer, have highlighted the role of change in GRK expression to oncogenesis and tumor proliferation. In this study, we evaluated the expression of GRK5 in grade II to grade IV glioma specimens using immunohistochemistry and found that GRK5 expression levels are highly correlated with aggressiveness of glioma. We used culture conditions to selectively promote the growth of either glioblastoma cells with stem cell markers (GSC) or differentiated glioblastoma cells (DGC) from fresh GBM specimens. GSC are known to be highly invasive and mobile, and have the capacity to self-renew and are more resistant to chemotherapy and radiation compared to differentiated populations of GBM. We examined the expression of GRK5 in these two sets of culturing conditions for GBM cells and found that GRK5 expression is upregulated in GSC compared to differentiated GBM cells. To better understand the role of GRK5 in GBM-derived stem cells, we created stable GRK5 knockdown and evaluated the proliferation rate. Using an ATP chemiluminescence assay, we show, for the first time, that knocking down the expression of GRK5 decreased the proliferation rate of GSC in contrast to control.""","""['Gurvinder Kaur', 'Joseph Kim', 'Rajwant Kaur', 'Ili Tan', 'Orin Bloch', 'Matthew Z Sun', 'Michael Safaee', 'Michael C Oh', 'Michael Sughrue', 'Joanna Phillips', 'Andrew T Parsa']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Clin Neurosci""","""['Formylpeptide receptor FPR and the rapid growth of malignant human gliomas.', 'G-protein coupled receptor kinase 5 regulates prostate tumor growth.', 'Autocrine factors sustain glioblastoma stem cell self-renewal.', 'The role of basic fibroblast growth factor in glioblastoma multiforme and glioblastoma stem cells and in their in vitro culture.', 'Taking advantage of neural development to treat glioblastoma.', 'Differential Regulation of GPCRs-Are GRK Expression Levels the Key?', 'Identification of Candidate Biomarkers for Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura by Bioinformatics Analysis of Microarray Data.', 'Involvement of the Catecholamine Pathway in Glioblastoma Development.', 'The GRKs Reactome: Role in Cell Biology and Pathology.', 'Unraveling the Molecular Nexus between GPCRs, ERS, and EMT.']"""

Currently, androgen deprivation therapy is the gold standard treatment for advanced prostate cancer, but inevitably, a subpopulation of cancer cells survives and repopulates the tumor. Tumor cells that survive androgen withdrawal are critical therapeutic targets for more effective treatments, but current model systems cannot determine when they arise in disease progression and are unable to recapitulate variable patient response to treatment. A model system was developed in which stromal-supported xenografts from multiple patients with early-stage localized disease can be tested for response to castration. The histopathology of these xenografts mimicked the original tumors, and short-term host castration resulted in reduced proliferation and increased apoptosis in tumor cells. After 4 weeks of castration, residual populations of quiescent, stem-like tumor cells remained. Without subsequent treatment, these residual cells displayed regenerative potential, because testosterone readministration resulted in emergence of rapidly proliferating tumors. Therefore, this model may be useful for revealing potential cellular targets in prostate cancer, which exist before the onset of aggressive incurable disease. Specific eradication of these regenerative tumor cells that survive castration could then confer survival benefits for patients.""","""['Roxanne Toivanen', 'Mark Frydenberg', 'Declan Murphy', 'John Pedersen', 'Andrew Ryan', 'David Pook', 'David M Berman;Australian Prostate Cancer BioResource;Renea A Taylor', 'Gail P Risbridger']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Sci Transl Med""","""['To target or not to target the enemy within localized prostate cancer.', 'Testosterone boosts for treatment of castration resistant prostate cancer: an experimental implementation of intermittent androgen deprivation.', 'Endocrine treatment of prostate cancer.', 'Redefining clinically significant castration levels in patients with prostate cancer receiving continuous androgen deprivation therapy.', 'Carbidopa enhances antitumoral activity of bicalutamide on the androgen receptor-axis in castration-resistant prostate tumors.', 'Combined androgen blockade: the gold standard for metastatic prostate cancer.', 'The future of patient-derived xenografts in prostate cancer research.', 'The MURAL collection of prostate cancer patient-derived xenografts enables discovery through preclinical models of uro-oncology.', 'PDX: Moving Beyond Drug Screening to Versatile Models for Research Discovery.', 'Critical evaluation of the subcutaneous engraftments of hormone naïve primary prostate cancer.', 'Dying tumor cell-derived exosomal miR-194-5p potentiates survival and repopulation of tumor repopulating cells upon radiotherapy in pancreatic cancer.']"""

PCa is the second leading cause of male-related cancer death in Western societies. Although distinct pathologies, BPH and PCa are both characterized by extensive stromal remodeling, in particular fibroblast-to-myofibroblast differentiation, thought to be induced by elevated local production of TGFβ1. We previously showed that TGFβ1-mediated fibroblast-to-myofibroblast differentiation of primary human prostatic stromal cells resulted in the dsyregulation of several components of the IGF axis, including the induction of IGF binding protein 3 (IGFBP3). Using isoform-specific lentiviral-mediated knockdown, we demonstrate herein that IGFBP3 is essential for TGFβ1-mediated differentiation. Although recombinant human IGFBP3 alone was not sufficient to induce differentiation, IGFBP3 synergistically potentiated TGFβ1-mediated stromal remodeling predominantly via an IGF-independent mechanism. Consistent with these in vitro findings, IGFBP3 immunohistochemistry revealed elevated levels of IGFBP3 in the hyperplastic fibromuscular stroma of BPH specimens and in the tumor-adjacent stroma of high-grade PCa. Collectively these data indicate that the dysregulation of the stromal IGF axis, in particular elevated IGFBP3, plays a crucial role in fibroblast-to-myofibroblast differentiation in the diseased prostatic stroma and indicate the therapeutic potential of inhibiting stromal remodeling and the resulting dysregulation of the stromal IGF axis as a novel strategy for the treatment of advanced PCa and BPH.""","""['Natalie Sampson', 'Christoph Zenzmaier', 'Martin Heitz', 'Martin Hermann', 'Eugen Plas', 'Georg Schäfer', 'Helmut Klocker', 'Peter Berger']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Endocrinology""","""['ROS signaling by NOX4 drives fibroblast-to-myofibroblast differentiation in the diseased prostatic stroma.', 'Dickkopf-related protein 3 promotes pathogenic stromal remodeling in benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer.', 'Phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibition reverts prostate fibroblast-to-myofibroblast trans-differentiation.', 'Progesterone receptor in the prostate: A potential suppressor for benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer.', 'Therapeutic targeting of redox signaling in myofibroblast differentiation and age-related fibrotic disease.', 'Effect of Diabetes Mellitus on Symptomatic Improvement After Surgery for Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia in Patients With Lower Urinary Tract Symptom and its Relations With Prostatic Urethral Angulation.', 'A Novel Insight into the Immune-Related Interaction of Inflammatory Cytokines in Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia.', 'A Dynamic Transcriptome Map of Different Tissue Microenvironment Cells Identified During Gastric Cancer Development Using Single-Cell RNA Sequencing.', 'The relationship between glucose homeostasis status and prostate size in aging Chinese males with benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'Impact of α-adrenoceptor antagonists on prostate cancer development, progression and prevention.']"""

TV was categorized as minimal (≤1.0 ml), moderate (1.1-5.0 ml), or extensive (>5.0 ml). Cox regression analysis was performed to identify independent predictors of BCR. The predictive accuracies of Cox's proportional hazard regression models with and without TV were quantified and compared using time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curve analysis.  Results:   Increasing TV was associated with higher prostate specific antigen, pathological Gleason score, and pathologic tumor stage. TV was an independent predictor of BCR in multivariate analysis (p<0.001). When patients were stratified by organ-confined and nonorgan-confined tumor groups, TV remained an independent predictor of BCR in organ-confined tumors (p<0.001). In the nonorgan-confined tumor group, a significant difference was found only between extensive versus minimal TV (p=0.023). The predictive accuracy of the Cox regression model increased significantly by adding TV in organ-confined tumor group (0.748 vs. 0.704, p<0.05) but not in nonorgan-confined group (0.742 vs. 0.734, p>0.05).  Conclusions:   TV was an independent prognostic predictor of BCR in organ-confined prostate cancers and provided additional prognostic information with increased predictive accuracy.

Here, we report that the HBP is activated in prostate cancer cells and that OGT is a central regulator of c-Myc stability in this setting. HBP genes were overexpressed in human prostate cancers and androgen regulated in cultured human cancer cell lines. Immunohistochemical analysis of human specimens (n = 1987) established that OGT is upregulated at the protein level and that its expression correlates with high Gleason score, pT and pN stages, and biochemical recurrence. RNA interference-mediated siliencing or pharmacologic inhibition of OGT was sufficient to decrease prostate cancer cell growth. Microarray profiling showed that the principal effects of OGT inhibition in prostate cancer cells were related to cell-cycle progression and DNA replication. In particular, c-MYC was identified as a candidate upstream regulator of OGT target genes and OGT inhibition elicited a dose-dependent decrease in the levels of c-MYC protein but not c-MYC mRNA in cell lines. Supporting this relationship, expression of c-MYC and OGT was tightly correlated in human prostate cancer samples (n = 1306).

This study hypothesized that recently reported differences between predictions from the model and findings from other cohorts were due to how prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was entered into the statistical model, and to the inclusion of protocol end-of-study biopsies for which there was no clinical indication.  Methods:   Data was obtained from the 5088 PCPT participants and was used to construct the PCPT Risk Calculator. The relationship between PSA and the risk of a positive biopsy was modeled by using locally-weighted regression (lowess), an empirical estimate of actual risks observed which does not depend on a statistical model. Risks were estimated with and without the 3514 end-of-study biopsies.  Results:   For PSA levels above biopsy thresholds (∼4 ng/mL), the PCPT Risk Calculator greatly overestimated actual empirical risks (eg, 44% versus 26% at 5 ng/mL). The change in risk with increasing PSA was less among for-cause biopsies compared with the end-of-study biopsies (P = .001). Risk of high-grade disease was overestimated at PSA level of ≥ 6 ng/mL.  Conclusions:   The PCPT Risk Calculator overestimates risks for PSAs close to and above typical biopsy thresholds. Separating for-cause biopsies from end-of-study biopsies and using empirical rather than model-based risks reduces overall risk estimates and replicates prior findings that, in men who have been screened with PSA, there is no rapid increase in prostate cancer risk with higher PSA.

Methods:   A cohort of men with CRPC with and without metastases (M) treated with secondary hormonal therapy (2eHT) and/or chemotherapy (CT) was identified from the authors' institutional database. Associations of patient and disease characteristics at diagnosis, at androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) initiation, at CRPC index date, and survival were evaluated. CRPC index date was defined as the start date of either 2eHT or CT, whichever came first.  Results:   In the cohort of 622 men, 434 men (70%) had M-positive disease; 552 men (89%) received 2eHT and 70 men (11%) received CT as their initial CRPC treatment. There were 410 deaths (66%) at the time of analysis. Median overall survival (OS) was 35 months (quartile 1, quartile 3: 21 months, 61 months). In multivariate analyses, higher biopsy Gleason score, the presence of M at ADT initiation, shorter time from ADT start to CRPC, higher prostate-specific antigen and poorer Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status at CRPC and M at CRPC were predictive of shorter OS. Interestingly, whereas some men with biopsy Gleason scores of 6 died of their disease (N = 42), they had a longer OS after CRPC compared with those with a Gleason score ≥ 7.  Conclusions:   This large retrospective study of patients with CRPC in a tertiary cancer center shows that biopsy Gleason score of 6 is associated with a less aggressive CRPC course, and the impact that M at ADT initiation and CRPC have on outcome is quantified.""","""['Mari Nakabayashi', 'Julia Hayes', 'Mary-Ellen Taplin', 'Patrick Lefebvre', 'Marie-Helene Lafeuille', 'Mark Pomerantz', 'Christopher Sweeney', 'Mei Sheng Duh', 'Philip W Kantoff']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Cancer""","""['Reply to clinical predictors of survival in men with castration-resistant prostate cancer: evidence that Gleason score 6 cancer can evolve to lethal disease.', 'Clinical predictors of survival in men with castration-resistant prostate cancer: evidence that Gleason score 6 cancer can evolve to lethal disease.', 'Alkaline phosphatase velocity predicts overall survival and bone metastasis in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Predictive factor analysis of time to progression of castration-resistant prostate cancer after androgen deprivation therapy.', 'Prognostic value of ECOG performance status and Gleason score in the survival of castration-resistant prostate cancer: a systematic review.', 'Comparative pathology of dog and human prostate cancer.', 'Nonmetastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: Current Challenges and Trends.', 'Treatment Patterns Among Patients With Advanced Prostate Cancer in Brazil: An Analysis of a Private Healthcare System Database.', 'Treatment Landscape of Nonmetastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: A Window of Opportunity.', 'Patient and caregiver benefit-risk preferences for nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer treatment.', 'Budget Impact of Enzalutamide for Nonmetastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Predictors of skeletal-related events and mortality in men with metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer: Results from the Shared Equal Access Regional Cancer Hospital (SEARCH) database.']"""

We investigated the optimal metronomic dose of oral vinorelbine when given as monotherapy in patients with metastatic cancer.  Methods:   Patients with recurrent metastatic breast (BC), prostate (PC) or non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and adequate organ functions were randomly assigned to 30, 40 or 50 mg vinorelbine, taken orally three times a week. Treatment continued until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent or maximum 24 months. Primary endpoint was time-to-treatment failure (TTF) and secondary were progression-free survival (PFS), toxicity, changes in blood concentrations of angiogenesis-associated biomarkers and pharmacokinetics.  Results:   Seventy-three patients were enrolled. Four-month TTF rate did not differ between the three arms: 25.9% (11.1%-46.2% 95% Confidence Interval), 33.3% (15.6%-55.3%) and 18.2% (5.2%-40.3%) for the 30 mg, 40 mg and 50 mg arms (p-value = 0.56). Objective response was seen in 2 patients with NSCLC (treated at 30 and 50 mg respectively), one with BC (at 40 m g) and one with PC (at 50 mg) and lasted from 4 to 100 weeks, with maximum response duration achieved at 50 mg. Adverse events were mild and negligible and did not differ between the three arms. Blood levels of vinorelbine reached steady state from the second week of treatment and mean values for the 30, 40 and 50 mg were respectively 1.8 ng/ml (SD 1.10), 2.2 ng/ml (SD 1.87) and 2.6 ng/ml (SD 0.69). Low pre-treatment blood concentrations of FGF2 and IL8 predicted favorable response to therapy (p values 0.02 and 0.006, respectively), while high levels of TEK gene transcript predicted treatment resistance.  Conclusions:   Considering the antitumor activity and response duration, the negligible toxicity of the highest dose investigated and the lack of drug accumulation over time, we suggest that 50 mg given three times a week is the optimal dose for metronomic oral vinorelbine.

Herein, using a battery of biophysical tools, we show that the binding of EGR1 to DNA is tightly regulated by solution pH. Importantly, the binding affinity undergoes an enhancement of more than an order of magnitude with an increase in pH from 5 to 8, implying that the deprotonation of an ionizable residue accounts for such behavior. This ionizable residue is identified as His382 by virtue of the fact that its replacement by nonionizable residues abolishes the pH dependence of the binding of EGR1 to DNA. Notably, His382 inserts into the major groove of DNA, and stabilizes the EGR1-DNA interaction via both hydrogen bonding and van der Waals contacts. Remarkably, His382 is mainly conserved across other members of the EGR family, implying that histidine protonation-deprotonation may serve as a molecular switch for modulating the protein-DNA interactions that are central to this family of transcription factors. Collectively, our findings reveal an unexpected but a key step in the molecular recognition of the EGR family of transcription factors, and suggest that they may act as sensors of pH within the intracellular environment.""","""['David C Mikles', 'Vikas Bhat', 'Brett J Schuchardt', 'Brian J Deegan', 'Kenneth L Seldeen', 'Caleb B McDonald', 'Amjad Farooq']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""FEBS J""","""['Enthalpic factors override the polyelectrolyte effect in the binding of EGR1 transcription factor to DNA.', 'The electrostatic role of the Zn-Cys2His2 complex in binding of operator DNA with transcription factors: mouse EGR-1 from the Cys2His2 family.', 'Binding of the ERalpha nuclear receptor to DNA is coupled to proton uptake.', 'Studying allosteric regulation in metal sensor proteins using computational methods.', 'Secondary interactions involving zinc-bound ligands: roles in structural stabilization and macromolecular interactions.', 'Nucleic acid-induced dimerization of HIV-1 Gag protein.', 'DNA-protein interaction: identification, prediction and data analysis.', 'pH-Lemon, a Fluorescent Protein-Based pH Reporter for Acidic Compartments.', 'Ehrlichia chaffeensis TRP120 nucleomodulin binds DNA with disordered tandem repeat domain.', 'Nuclear proton dynamics and interactions with calcium signaling.']"""

The current use of single modality transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) for biopsy guidance has a limited sensitivity and specificity for accurately identifying cancerous lesions within the prostate. This study introduces a novel prostate cancer imaging method that combines TRUS with electrical impedance tomography (EIT) and reports on initial clinical findings based on in vivo measurements.  Methods:   The ultrasound system provides anatomic information, which guides EIT image reconstruction. EIT reconstructions are correlated with semiquantitative pathological findings. Thin plate spline warping transformations are employed to overlay electrical impedance images and pathological maps describing the spatial distribution of prostate cancer, with the latter used as reference for data analysis. Clinical data were recorded from a total of 50 men prior to them undergoing radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer treatment. Student's t-tests were employed to statistically examine the electrical property difference between cancerous tissue and benign tissue as defined through histological assessment of the excised gland.  Results:   Example EIT reconstructions are presented along with a statistical analysis comparing EIT and pathology. An average transformation error of 1.67% is found when 381 spatially coregistered pathological images are compared with their target EIT reconstructed counterparts. At EIT signal frequencies of 0.4, 3.2, and 25.6 kHz, paired-testing demonstrated that the conductivity of cancerous regions is significantly greater than that of benign regions ( p < 0.0304).

To evaluate the impact of MLC leaf width on the adaptive plan for each daily CBCT, three MLC shifted plans were created using three different leaf widths of MLCs (a total of 225 adaptive treatment plans). Selective dosimetric endpoints for the tumor volumes and organs at risk (OARs) were evaluated for these adaptive plans. Using the planning CT from a selected patient, MLC shifted plans for three hypothetical longitudinal shifts of 2, 4, and 8 mm were delivered on the three linear accelerators to test the deliverability of the shifted plans and to compare the dose accuracy of the shifted plans with the original IMRT plans.  Results:   Adaptive plans from 2.5 and 5 mm MLCs had inadequate dose coverage to the prostate (D99 < 97%, or D(mean) < 99% of the planned dose) in 6%-8% of the fractions, while adaptive plans from 10 mm MLC led to inadequate dose coverage to the prostate in 25.3% of the fractions. The average V56Gy of the prostate over the six patients was improved by 6.4% (1.6%-32.7%) and 5.8% (1.5%-35.7%) with adaptive plans from 2.5 and 5 mm MLCs, respectively, when compared with adaptive plans from 10 mm MLC. Pelvic lymph nodes were well covered for all MLC adaptive plans, as small differences were observed for D99, D(mean), and V(50.4Gy). Similar OAR sparing could be achieved for the bladder and rectum with all three MLCs for treatment adaptation. The MLC shifted plans can be accurately delivered on all three linear accelerators with accuracy similar to their original IMRT plans, where gamma (3%∕3 mm) passing rates were 99.6%, 93.0%, and 92.1% for 2.5, 5, and 10 mm MLCs, respectively. The percentages of pixels with dose differences between the measurement and calculation being less than 3% of the maximum dose were 85.9%, 82.5%, and 70.5% for the original IMRT plans from the three MLCs, respectively.  Conclusions:   Dosimetric advantages associated with smaller MLC leaves were observed in terms of the coverage to the prostate, when the treatment was adapted to account for daily prostate movement for concurrent irradiation of the prostate and pelvic lymph nodes. The benefit of switching the MLC from 10 to 5 mm was significant (p ≪ 0.01); however, switching the MLC from 5 to 2.5 mm would not gain significant (p = 0.15) improvement. IMRT plans with smaller MLC leaf widths achieved more accurate dose delivery.""","""['Qingyang Shang', 'Peng Qi', 'Samah Ferjani', 'Ping Xia']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Alignment focus of daily image guidance for concurrent treatment of prostate and pelvic lymph nodes.', 'Stereotactic IMRT for prostate cancer: dosimetric impact of multileaf collimator leaf width in the treatment of prostate cancer with IMRT.', 'Dosimetric study using different leaf-width MLCs for treatment planning of dynamic conformal arcs and intensity-modulated radiosurgery.', 'Evaluation of fluence-based dose delivery incorporating the spatial variation of dosimetric leaf gap (DLG).', 'Adaptive optimization by 6 DOF robotic couch in prostate volumetric IMRT treatment: rototranslational shift and dosimetric consequences.', 'A Comprehensive Evaluation of the Application of the Halcyon(2.0) IMRT Technique in Long-Course Radiotherapy for Rectal Cancer.', 'A Method of High-Resolution Radiotherapy Delivery Fluences with a Pair of Fields with Orthogonal Collimator Settings: A Study on Ten Head-and-Neck Cancer Patients.', 'Technological quality requirements for stereotactic radiotherapy : Expert review group consensus from the DGMP Working Group for Physics and Technology in Stereotactic Radiotherapy.', 'Is High Definition MLC Dosimetrically Superior to Standard Definition MLC for SIB-SBRT for Carcinoma Prostate.', 'Quality of tri-Co-60 MR-IGRT treatment plans in comparison with VMAT treatment plans for spine SABR.']"""

Distant metastasis represents the major lethal cause of prostate cancer. The most critical clinical challenge in the management of the patients is identifying those individuals at risk of developing metastatic disease. To understand the molecular mechanisms of prostate cancer metastasis and identify markers with metastatic potential, we have analyzed protein expression in two syngeneic prostate cancer cells lines PC3-N2 and PC3-ML2 using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation labeling and multi-dimensional protein identification technology liquid chromatography matrix assisted laser desorption ionization tandem mass spectrometry. PC3-N2 is lowly metastatic while PC3-ML2 highly metastatic. A total of 1,756 proteins were identified in the analyses with 130 proteins showing different expression levels (p<0.01) in the two cell lines. Out of these, 68 proteins were found to be significantly up-regulated while 62 are significantly down-regulated in PC3-ML2 cells compared with PC3-N2 cells. The upregulation of plectin and vimentin which were the most significantly differentially expressed were validated by Western blot and their functional relevance with respect to invasion and migration was determined by siRNA gene silencing.

Recently, abiraterone and cabazitaxel were approved for use after docetaxel failure, with improved survival. National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) preliminary recommendations were negative for both abiraterone (now positive in final recommendation) and cabazitaxel (negative in final recommendation).  Objective:   To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of abiraterone, cabazitaxel, mitoxantrone and prednisone for mCRPC treatment in US.  Methods:   A decision-tree model was constructed to compare the two mCRPC treatments versus two placebos over 18 months from a societal perspective. Chance nodes include baseline pain as a severity indicator, grade III/IV side-effects, and survival at 18 months. Probabilities, survival and health utilities were from published studies. Model cost inputs included drug treatment, side-effect management and prevention, radiation for pain, and death associated costs in 2010 US dollars.  Results:   Abiraterone is a cost-effective choice at $94K/QALY (quality adjusted life years) compared to placebo in our base-case analysis. Cabazitaxel and abiraterone are the most effective, yet also most expensive agents. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) at base-case are $101K/QALY (extended dominated) for mitoxantrone vs. placebo, $91K/QALY for abiraterone vs. mitoxantrone, $956K/QALY for cabazitaxel vs. abiraterone. Abiraterone becomes less cost-effective as its AWP increases, or if the cost of mitoxantrone side-effect management decreases. Increases in the percentage of patients with baseline pain leads to an increased ICER for both mitoxantrone and abiraterone, but mitoxantrone does relatively better. Cabazitaxel remains not cost-effective.  Conclusion:   Our base case model suggests that abiraterone is a cost-effective option in docetaxel-refractory mCRPC patients.

In DU145 and TRAMP-C1 prostate and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, we demonstrated that polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid-mediated activation of TLR3 induces microRNAs targeting DNA methyltransferases, leading to demethylation and reexpression of the oncosuppressor retinoic acid receptor beta (RARβ).

This ability is due to the maintenance of telomeres, erosion of which causes cellular senescence or death. While most cancer cells activate telomerase, a telomere-elongating enzyme, it remains elusive as to why cancer cells often maintain shorter telomeres than the cells in the surrounding normal tissues. Here, we show that forced telomere elongation in cancer cells promotes their differentiation in vivo. We elongated the telomeres of human prostate cancer cells that possess short telomeres by enhancing their telomerase activity. The resulting cells had long telomeres and retained the ability to form tumors in nude mice. Strikingly, these tumors exhibited many duct-like structures and reduced N-cadherin expression, reminiscent of well-differentiated adenocarcinoma. These changes were caused by telomere elongation and not by enhanced telomerase activity. Gene expression profiling revealed that tumor formation was accompanied by the expression of innate immune system-related genes, which have been implicated in maintaining tumor cells in an undifferentiated state and poor-prognosis cancers. In tumors derived from the telomere-elongated cells, upregulation of such gene sets is not observed.

Results:   Time from diagnosis to definitive (prostatectomy and radiation) treatment was longer for AA patients in all risk groups, and most pronounced in high-risk cancer (96 versus 105 days, P < .001). On multivariate analysis, racial differences to any and definitive treatment persisted (β = 7.3 and 7.6, respectively, for AA patients).

In agreement with the proteomic analysis, we found that COMP and periostin expressions were significantly increased in aggressive prostate tumors while VAP-1 expression was significantly decreased in aggressive tumor. In addition, the expression of these proteins in prostate metastases also follows the same pattern observed in the proteomic analysis.

Despite the large number of patients treated with RT, some issues about optimal techniques, doses, volumes, timing, and association with androgen deprivation are still subject of debate. The aim of this survey was to determine the patterns of choice of Italian radiation oncologists in two different clinical cases of prostate cancer patients treated with radical RT.  Study design:   During the 2010 Italian Association of Radiation Oncology (AIRO) National congress, four different clinical cases were presented to attending radiation oncologists. Two of them were prostate cancer cases that could be treated by RT +/- hormonal therapy (HT), different for T stage of primary tumour according to TNM, preoperative diagnostic procedures for staging, initial prostate specific antigen (iPSA), and Gleason Score sum of biopsy. For each clinical case, radiation oncologists were asked to: (a) give indication to pretreatment procedures for staging; (b) give indication to treatment; (c) define specifically, where indicated, total dose, type of fractionation, volumes of treatment, type of technique, type of image-guided setup control; (d) indicate if HT should be prescribed; (e) define criteria that particularly influenced prescription. A descriptive statistical analysis was performed.  Results:   Three hundred questionnaires were given to radiation oncologists attending the congress, 128 questionnaires were completed and considered for this analysis (41%). Some important differences were shown in prescribing and delivering RT, particularly with regards to treatment volumes and fractionation.  Conclusions:   Despite the results of clinical trials, several differences still exist among Italian radiation oncologists in the treatment of prostate cancer patients. These patients probably deserve a more uniform approach, based on upto-date, detailed, and evidence-based recommendations.""","""['Berardino De Bari', 'Filippo Alongi', 'Pierfrancesco Franco', 'Patrizia Ciammella', 'Tarik Chekrine', 'Lorenzo Livi', 'Barbara A Jereczek-Fossa', 'Andrea Riccardo Filippi;AIRO Young and AIRO Prostate cancer Working Group']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Radiol Med""","""['The PROCAINA (PROstate CAncer INdication Attitudes) Project (Part I): a survey among Italian radiation oncologists on postoperative radiotherapy in prostate cancer.', 'The INTER-ROMA project--a survey among Italian radiation oncologists on their approach to the treatment of bone metastases.', 'Attitudes, practices and perspectives on imaging strategies in prostate cancer: a national cross-sectional survey involving expert radiation oncologists on behalf of AIRO (Italian association of radiotherapy and clinical oncology) GU group.', 'Patterns of practice of androgen deprivation therapy combined to radiotherapy in favorable and unfavorable intermediate risk prostate cancer.

However, the contribution of AR to the progression of upper urinary tract urothelial carcinomas (UUTUC) has not been fully investigated. In the present study, we demonstrated that the AR is involved in the metastasis and invasiveness of UUTUC cells. We investigated the role of the AR in UUTUC by using UUTUC-derived BFTC 909 cells. The overexpression of AR promotes the migration and invasion of BFTC 909 cells. Expression of migration/invasion-related genes was increased in BFTC 909 cells overexpressing AR determined by qPCR and western blot analyses. The results showed that AR-enhanced migration and invasion of UUTUC cells are linked to the upregulation of the matrix-degrading enzyme MMP-9 and cyclooxygenase (COX)-2. Subsequently, the blocking of MMP-9 and COX-2 signaling by inhibitors suppressed AR-enhanced cell migration and invasion. The results of the present study provide evidence for the first time of the role of AR in the motility and invasion of UUT cancer cells and support the hypothesis that the AR may play a critical role in the establishment of the invasive phenotype in urothelial neoplasia of UUT.

Here, we report that transcription of the p21Waf1/Cip1 and JNK-1 genes is affected by inhibition of the early growth response-1 (Egr-1) in response to a small interfering RNA [siRNA)-Egr-1] in LNCaP and PC-3 prostate carcinoma cell lines. The expression levels of protein were determined by western blotting, and apoptosis was measured by propidium iodide staining and flow cytometric analysis. Inhibition of Egr-1, p21 and JNK-1 was carried out by siRNAs. LNCaP and PC-3 cells exhibited readily detectable Egr-1, JNK and p21, even in low serum medium without the addition of other exogenous agents. The expression of Egr-1, p21 and JNK was strongly increased after treatment of the cells with TPA, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) or arsenite. Suppression of Egr-1 expression by siRNA abrogated the ability of TPA to induce Egr-1 and JNK-1 activities, moderately increasing the p21 activity and abrogating the anti-apoptotic effect of Egr-1 observed in the prostate cancer cell lines. Moreover, blockade of p21 and JNK was unable to decrease the activity of Egr-1, while siRNA against p21 abrogated the pro‑apoptotic effect of p21.

Whether body mass index (BMI) differentially influences the risk across the stages of colorectal cancer development remains unclear. We evaluated the associations of BMI with colorectal adenoma incidence, adenoma recurrence, and cancer in the context of a large screening trial, in which cases and controls had an equal chance for disease detection.  Methods:   We prospectively evaluated the association between baseline BMI and the risk of incident distal adenoma (1,213 cases), recurrent adenoma (752 cases), and incident colorectal cancer (966 cases) among men and women, ages 55 to 74 years, randomly assigned to receive flexible sigmoidoscopy screening as part of the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial. We calculated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs for adenoma incidence and recurrence, and hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs for colorectal cancer incidence, using multivariable-adjusted models.  Results:   Compared with normal-weight men (18.5 to 24.9 kg/m(2)), obese men (≥ 30 kg/m(2)) had significantly higher risk of incident adenoma (OR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.06 to 1.65) and colorectal cancer (HR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.16 to 1.89) and a borderline increased risk of recurrent adenoma (OR, 1.50; 95% CI, 0.98 to 2.30). No associations were observed for either adenoma or cancer in women.

The anterior third only was involved in 21%, the middle third in 6.8% and the posterior third in 8.7% of positive cases, although in 75% of positive cases there was some anterior involvement. Comparing uniquely anterior tumours with the 15.5% found uniquely in either the middle or posterior thirds, there was no significant difference between number of positive cores (2 vs 1, P = 0.091), maximum percentage core involvement (30 vs 17.5%, P = 0.315) and maximum tumour length (3.5 vs 2 mm, P = 0.092). Fourteen patients (5.2%) developed AUR. On multivariate analysis, PSA density (PSAD) and pre-TTSB PSA predicted PCa diagnosis, whilst prostate volume, prebiopsy PSA and PSAD predicted AUR.  Conclusions:   Modified TTSB has a high cancer yield, especially in the anterior region, in patients with previously negative histology but onward suspicion of PCa. The modified TTSB technique provides a low risk of AUR without compromising cancer yield.""","""['Kingsley Ekwueme', 'Helen Simpson', 'Hani Zakhour', 'Nigel J Parr']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Re: Transperineal template-guided saturation biopsy using a modified technique: outcome of 270 cases requiring repeat prostate biopsy.', 'High detection rate of significant prostate tumours in anterior zones using transperineal ultrasound-guided template saturation biopsy.', 'Transperineal template-guided prostate saturation biopsies in men with suspicion of prostate cancer: a pilot study from Pakistan.', 'The role of transperineal template prostate biopsies in restaging men with prostate cancer managed by active surveillance.', 'Atypical small acinar proliferation (ASAP): Is a repeat biopsy necessary ASAP?

Patients and methods:   A total of 93 potential candidates for focal cryotherapy underwent grey-scale and Doppler TRUS-guided biopsy. All real-time TRUS images were recorded, allowing subsequent reviewing for the planning of targeted focal cryotherapy, and/or follow-up targeted biopsy. The spatial mapping of TRUS-visible lesions and targeted sampling areas were individually documented in schematic anatomic drawings of the prostate. Data from the baseline imaging-targeted biopsies were compared with systematic (non-targeted) biopsies. Of the 93 patients, 73 patients with low- to intermediate-risk disease were eventually considered to be candidates for hemi-ablative focal cryosurgery, i.e. cryoablation of one lobe.  Results:   Among the 93 patients, a total of 681 biopsy cores were available for analysis, including imaging-targeted (n = 256, 37.5%) and systematic (n = 425, 62.5%) cores. Of the 256 targeted biopsy cores, 65% (n = 167) were positive for cancer, compared with 6.2% (26/425) in systematic (non-targeted) cores (P < 0.001). A total of 88% (82/93) of the biopsy-proven cancer index lesions were TRUS-visible. When comparing TRUS-visible with image-invisible index lesions, the cancer-involved core length was 6.1 vs 1.5 mm (P < 0.001), respectively. Furthermore, the percent of core with involved cancer was 48 vs 16% (P < 0.001), and the mean Gleason score was 7.0 vs 6.2 (P < 0.001). With increasing TRUS-visible lesion size (<10, 11-15, 16-20, >20 mm), cancer-involved core length and percent of core with cancer also significantly increased (P = 0.009 and P = 0.008, respectively).  Conclusions:   TRUS-guided targeted biopsies significantly improved the detection and staging of higher grade and larger volume cancer, compared with image-blind (non-targeted systematic) biopsies.

The most potent are the marine-derived eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), which counteract the pro-inflammatory omega-6 FA. Americans take in an average of only 100 mg of EPA plus DHA per day resulting in a low omega-3:omega-6 intake ratio of 1:10 favoring inflammation. Cohort and/or case control studies suggest EPA and DHA are promising for breast, colon, and prostate cancer risk reduction. Mechanistic studies largely in preclinical models suggest EPA and DHA reduce synthesis of prostaglandin E2 and other inflammatory cytokines, decrease aromatase activity and proliferation, promote differentiation and apoptosis, and enhance insulin sensitivity. Animal models using 7% to 20% omega-3 added to chow are promising; however, this amount of omega-3 in a diet is unlikely to be acceptable to humans. The optimal EPA:DHA ratio or the lowest effective dose of EPA and DHA for cancer prevention is unclear, but it is likely to be more than 600 mg/day, which is six times the average American intake. Most phase II prevention trials use 1 to 3.3 g of EPA and DHA, which is safe and well tolerated. Two grams of EPA was associated with fewer polyps in individuals with familial adenomatous polyposis in a randomized, placebo-controlled trial.

Materials and methods:   A total of 1,642 consecutive prostate biopsy procedures during a 4-year period (2008 to 2012) were included in the study. Inclusion criteria consisted of pre-biopsy negative urine culture, bisacodyl enema and fluoroquinolone antibiotics (3 days). Formalin (10%) was used to disinfect the needle tip after each biopsy core. All patients were monitored for post-biopsy infection. The rate of infection was compared to that of a historical series of 990 procedures. Two ex vivo experiments were conducted to test the disinfectant effectiveness of formalin against fluoroquinolone resistant Escherichia coli, and another experiment was performed to quantitate formalin exposure.  Results:   Post-biopsy clinical sepsis with positive urine and blood cultures (quinolone resistant E. coli) developed in 2 patients (0.122%). Both patients were hospitalized, treated with intravenous antibiotics and had a full recovery without long-term sequelae. Mild uncomplicated urinary infection developed in 3 additional patients (0.183%). All were treated with outpatient oral antibiotics and had a complete recovery. The overall rate of urinary infection and sepsis using formalin disinfection was approximately a third of that of a prior series (0.30% vs 0.80%, p=0.13). Ex vivo experiments showed a complete lack of growth of fluoroquinolone resistant E. coli on blood and MacConkey agars after exposure to formalin. The amount of formalin exposure was negligible and well within the safe parameters of the Environmental Protection Agency.  Conclusions:   Formalin disinfection of the biopsy needle after each prostate biopsy core is associated with a low incidence of urinary infection and sepsis.

Here we have evaluated the effects of cholbut SLN on tumour cell growth using in vitro and in vivo models.  Experimental approach:   Cholbut SLNs were incubated with cultures of four tumour cell lines, and cell growth was analysed by assessing viability, clonogenic capacity and cell cycle. Effects on intracellular signalling was assessed by Western blot analysis of Akt expression. The in vivo anti-tumour activity was measured in two models of PC-3 cell xenografts in SCID/Beige mice.  Key results:   Cholbut SLN inhibited tumour cell line viability, clonogenic activity, Akt phosphorylation and cell cycle progression. In mice injected i.v. with PC3-Luc cells and treated with cholbut SLN, . in vivo optical imaging and histological analysis showed no metastases in the lungs of the treated mice. In another set of mice injected s.c. with PC-3 cells and treated with cholbut SLN when the tumour diameter reached 2 mm, analysis of the tumour dimensions showed that treatment with cholbut SLN substantially delayed tumour growth.

Methods:   We reviewed data from 38 patients with MSCC-induced paralysis from newly diagnosed prostate cancer who presented to our service between 1984 and 2010. Conservative treatment consisted of hormonal therapy with external radiation therapy (ERT). Patient demographic data, treatment details, involved spine MRI images, complications, and the course of neurologic recovery were investigated.  Results:   Twenty-five patients were treated conservatively. Mean follow-up period was 36.8 months.

After initiating conservative treatment, 75% (12 of 16) of these patients regained the ability to walk within 1 month, 88% (14 in 16) did so within 3 months, and all non-ambulatory patients did so within 6 months. No one had morbid complications. Four patients who did not regain the ability to walk at 1 month were found to have progressed to paraplegia rapidly, and tended to have severe compression as visualized on MRI, with a delay in the start of treatment in comparison with those who did so within 1 month (21.0 vs. 7.8 days).

This has fortunately led to an in-depth critical analysis of the available data. One advantage is the benefit on survival which increases with longer follow-up observation times. When carrying out studies the quantitative extent of this benefit can become obscured by prescreening, prevalent screening, lack of compliance, contamination and healthy screen bias. Nevertheless, the European randomized screening study of prostate cancer (ERSPC) study, for example, showed sufficient statistical power to confirm a screening benefit after 9 or 11 years (evidence level A). However, even for prostate cancer the internal problems of preventive medicine of overdiagnosis and overtherapy are also partially dependent on the age range of the screening population and the screening frequency (28-52%). Unnecessary deficits in the quality of life reduce the benefit of survival in these patients. By using a PSA fine tuning and risk stratification, approximately one third of diagnoses and therapies can be avoided.

Results:   There were 53 evaluable patients in the combined analysis: 20 (33%) achieved a PSA response, 16 (27%) achieved an erMRI partial response and 24 (40%) achieved an erMRI minor response. Median follow-up was 4.2 years, and 33 of 53 evaluable (62%) patients developed biochemical recurrence. On multivariable analysis, PSA response did not correlate with biochemical recurrence (hazard ratio=0.58, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.25-1.33) and paradoxically erMRI response was associated with a significantly shorter time to biochemical recurrence (hazard ratio=2.47, 95% CI 1.00-6.13).  Conclusions:   Response by 1.5T erMRI does not correlate with a decreased likelihood of biochemical recurrence in patients with high-risk localized prostate cancer treated with neoadjuvant docetaxel and may be associated with inferior outcomes. These data do not support the use of 1.5T erMRI response as a primary end point in neoadjuvant chemotherapy trials.""","""['M D Galsky', 'W Xie', 'M Nakabayashi', 'R W Ross', 'F M Fennessy', 'C M Tempany', 'T K Choueiri', 'K Khine', 'P W Kantoff', 'M-E Taplin', 'W K Oh']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['Phase 2 study of neoadjuvant docetaxel plus bevacizumab in patients with high-risk localized prostate cancer: a Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Consortium trial.', 'Docetaxel, bevacizumab, and androgen deprivation therapy for biochemical disease recurrence after definitive local therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) 90203: a randomized phase 3 study of radical prostatectomy alone versus estramustine and docetaxel before radical prostatectomy for patients with high-risk localized disease.', 'EAU guidelines on prostate cancer.

Objective:   To learn how patients describe the decision-making process for 10 common medical decisions, including 6 that are most often made in primary care.  Design:   A survey of a national sample of adults 40 years or older who in the preceding 2 years had either experienced or discussed with a health care provider 1 or more of 10 decisions: medication for hypertension, elevated cholesterol, or depression; screening for breast, prostate, or colon cancer; knee or hip replacement for osteoarthritis, or surgery for cataract or low back pain.  Setting:   Adults living in households in the United States in 2011.  Participants:   A national sample of adults drawn from a probability sample-based web panel developed by Knowledge Networks.  Main outcomes and measures:   Patients' perceptions of the extent to which the pros and cons were discussed with their health care providers, whether the patients were told they had a choice, and whether the patients were asked for their input.  Results:   Responses were obtained from 2718 patients, with a response rate of 58.3%. Respondents reported much more discussion of the pros than the cons of all tests or treatments; discussions about the surgical procedures tended to be more balanced than those about medications to reduce cardiac risks and cancer screening. Most patients (60%-78%) said they were asked for input for all but 3 decisions: medications for hypertension and elevated cholesterol and having mammograms (37.3%-42.7%). Overall, the reported decision-making processes were most patient centered for back or knee replacement surgery and least for breast and prostate cancer screening.

Recent in vitro studies suggested a complex mechanism of neuroepithelial interaction.  Objective:   The present study was intended to investigate whether the concept of neuroepithelial interaction can be supported by a quantitative analysis and planimetry of capsular nerves in relation to adjacent PCa foci.  Design, setting, and participants:   Whole-mount sections of the prostate were created from patients undergoing non-nerve-sparing laparoscopic radical prostatectomy. For each prostate, adjacent sections were created and stained both to identify capsular nerves (S100) and to localize cancer foci (hematoxylin and eosin).  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Computerized quantification and planimetry of capsular nerves (ImageJ software) were performed after applying a digital grid to define 12 capsular sectors. For statistical analyses, mixed linear models were calculated using the SAS 9.3 software package.  Results and limitations:   Specimens of 33 prostates were investigated. A total of 1957 capsular nerves and a total capsular nerve surface area of 26.44 mm(2) were measured. The major proportion was found in the dorsolateral (DL) region (p<0.001). Adjacent tumor was associated with a statistically significant higher capsular nerve count compared with the capsules of tumor-free sectors (p<0.005). Similar results were shown for capsular nerve surface area (p<0.006). Subsequent post hoc analyses at the sector level revealed that the effect of tumor on capsular nerve count or nerve surface area is most pronounced in the DL region.  Conclusions:   The presence of PCa foci resulted in a significantly increased capsular nerve count and capsular nerve surface area compared with tumor-free sectors. The present study supports former in vitro findings suggesting that the presence of PCa lesions may lead to complex neuroepithelial interactions resulting in PCa-induced nerve growth.""","""['Johannes Bründl', 'Sebastian Schneider', 'Florian Weber', 'Florian Zeman', 'Wolf F Wieland', 'Roman Ganzer']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Tumour innervation and neurosignalling in prostate cancer.', 'Topographical anatomy of periprostatic and capsular nerves: quantification and computerised planimetry.', 'Nerve quantification and computerized planimetry to evaluate periprostatic nerve distribution-does size matter?', 'Computer modeling technology to assess extracapsular tissue coverage of whole mount sections after retropubic and laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.', 'Nerve Dependence in Colorectal Cancer.', 'The Role of Perineural Invasion in Prostate Cancer and Its Prognostic Significance.', 'Objective quantification of nerves in immunohistochemistry specimens of thyroid cancer utilising deep learning.', 'Tumour innervation and neurosignalling in prostate cancer.', 'Perineural Invasion and Risk of Lethal Prostate Cancer.', 'Urinary nerve growth factor as an oncologic biomarker for prostate cancer aggressiveness.']"""

We investigated the potential role of BMP-6 in the context of macrophages and castration-resistant prostate cancer. When the androgen-responsive murine (Tramp-C1 and PTENCaP8) and human (LNCaP) CaP cell lines were cocultured with macrophages in the presence of dihydrotestosterone, BMP-6 increased androgen-responsive promoter activity and cell count significantly. Subsequent studies revealed that BMP-6 increased the expression level of androgen receptor (AR) mRNA and protein in CaP cell lines only in the presence of macrophages. Simultaneously, the AR antagonists bicalutamide and MDV3100 partially or completely blocked BMP-6-induced macrophage-mediated androgen hypersensitivity in CaP cells. Abolishing interleukin-6 signaling with neutralizing antibody in CaP/macrophage cocultures inhibited the BMP-6-mediated AR upregulation in CaP cells. Using Tramp-C1 and PTENCaP8 cells with a tetracycline-inducible expression of BMP-6, the induction of BMP-6 in vivo resulted in a significant resistance to castration. However, this resistance was blocked after the removal of macrophages with clodronate liposomes.

However, the target genes of hypoxia-induced metabolic alterations in the prostate remain uncertain. Mitochondrial aconitase (mACON) (ACONM) is an enzyme that is central to carbohydrate and energy metabolism and is responsible for the interconversion of citrate to isocitrate as part of the citric acid cycle in the human prostate. We evaluated the effects of the molecular mechanisms of hypoxia on mACON gene expression in PC-3 and LNCaP human prostate carcinoma cells. Immunoblotting assays revealed that hypoxia modulated mACON and lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) protein expression, while these effects were attenuated when HIF-1α was knocked down. Hypoxia induced fatty acid synthase (FASN) in PC-3 cells while hypoxia blocked FASN gene expression in LNCaP cells after 24-h incubation. Results of real-time RT-qPCR, immunoblotting, and transient gene expression assays revealed that hypoxia treatment or co-transfection with HIF-1α expression vector enhanced gene expression of mACON, implying that hypoxia modulated mACON at the transcriptional level. Hypoxia-induced mACON promoter activity is dependent on the DNA fragment located at -1013 to -842 upstream of the translation initiation site. l-mimosine, an iron chelator, stabilized HIF-1α but downregulated mACON gene expression, suggesting that iron chelation blocked the hypoxia-induced mACON gene expression.

While very popular in miRNA profiling studies, it remains unclear whether miRNA microarrays are suited or not to accurately detecting global miRNA decreases seen in cancers. In this work, we analyzed the miRNA profiles of samples with global miRNA decreases using Affymetrix miRNA microarrays following the inducible genetic deletion of Dicer1. Surprisingly, up to a third of deregulated miRNAs identified upon Dicer1 depletion were found to be up-regulated following standard robust multichip average (RMA) background correction and quantile normalization, indicative of normalization bias. Our comparisons of five preprocess steps performed at the probe level demonstrated that the use of cyclic loess relying on non-miRNA small RNAs present on the Affymetrix platform significantly improved specificity and sensitivity of detection of decreased miRNAs. These findings were validated in samples from patients with prostate cancer, where conjugation of robust normal-exponential background correction with cyclic loess normalization and array weights correctly identified the greatest number of decreased miRNAs, and the lowest amount of false-positive up-regulated miRNAs. These findings highlight the importance of miRNA microarray normalization for the detection of miRNAs that are truly differentially expressed and suggest that the use of cyclic loess based on non-miRNA small RNAs can help to improve the sensitivity and specificity of miRNA profiling in cancer samples with global miRNA decrease.""","""['Di Wu', 'Yifang Hu', 'Stephen Tong', 'Bryan R G Williams', 'Gordon K Smyth', 'Michael P Gantier']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""RNA""","""['Normalization of Affymetrix miRNA Microarrays for the Analysis of Cancer Samples.', 'Cancer-associated somatic DICER1 hotspot mutations cause defective miRNA processing and reverse-strand expression bias to predominantly mature 3p strands through loss of 5p strand cleavage.', 'Stop the dicing in hematopoiesis: what have we learned?', 'DICER1: mutations, microRNAs and mechanisms.', 'MicroRNAs in thyroid development, function and tumorigenesis.', 'A simple and efficient strategy for trace detection of ferroptosis-related miRNAs based on novel hydrophobic paper-based plasmonic substrate and ""inverse molecular sentinel (iMS)"" nanoprobes.', 'Induction of Apoptosis and Regulation of MicroRNA Expression by (2E,6E)-2,6-bis-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzylidene)-cyclohexanone (BHMC) Treatment on MCF-7 Breast Cancer Cells.', 'Dynamic mRNP Remodeling in Response to Internal and External Stimuli.', 'Normalization Methods for the Analysis of Unbalanced Transcriptome Data: A Review.', 'Metabolite-mediated TOR signaling regulates the circadian clock in Arabidopsis.']"""

The objectives of this study were to confirm the ability of 4,4'- and 7,7'-dibromo- and dichloro-substituted ring-DIMs to inhibit androgen-stimulated proliferation of androgen-dependent LNCaP human prostate cancer cells using a non-invasive, real-time monitoring technique. In addition, their ability to induce apoptotic and necrotic cell death in androgen-dependent as well as -independent (PC-3) prostate cancer cells was studied. Prostate cancer cells were treated with increasing concentrations of DIM and ring-DIMs (0.3-30 μM) and effects on cell proliferation were measured in real-time using an xCELLigence cellular analysis system. Chromatin condensation and loss of membrane integrity were determined by Hoechst and propidium iodide staining, respectively. Apoptotic protein markers were measured by immunoblotting and activation of caspases determined using selective fluorogenic substrates. Intra- and extracellular concentrations of DIM and ring-DIMs were assessed by electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. Ring-DIMs inhibited androgen-stimulated LNCaP cell proliferation and induced apoptosis and necrosis in LNCaP and PC-3 cells with 2-4 fold greater potencies than DIM. DIM and the ring-DIMs increased caspases -3, -8 and -9 activity, elevated expression of Fas, FasL, DR4 and DR5 protein, and induced PARP cleavage in both cell lines. The cytotoxicity of the most potent ring-DIM, 4,4'-dibromoDIM, but not the other compounds was decreased by an inhibitor of caspase -3. The 4,4'-dibromoDIM was primarily found in the extracellular medium, whereas all other compounds were present to a much larger extent in the cell. In conclusion, ring-DIMs inhibited prostate cancer cell growth and induced cell death in LNCaP and PC-3 cells with greater potencies than DIM; they also structure-dependently activated different cell death pathways suggesting that these compounds have clinical potential as chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic agents in prostate cancer, regardless of hormone-dependency.""","""['A A Goldberg', 'V I Titorenko', 'A Beach', 'K Abdelbaqi', 'S Safe', 'J T Sanderson']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Invest New Drugs""","""[""Antiandrogenic and growth inhibitory effects of ring-substituted analogs of 3,3'-diindolylmethane (ring-DIMs) in hormone-responsive LNCaP human prostate cancer cells."", 'Diindolylmethane and its halogenated derivatives induce protective autophagy in human prostate cancer cells via induction of the oncogenic protein AEG-1 and activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK).', ""3,3'-Diindolylmethane (DIM) and its ring-substituted halogenated analogs (ring-DIMs) induce differential mechanisms of survival and death in androgen-dependent and -independent prostate cancer cells."", 'Indole-3-carbinol and prostate cancer.', 'Targeting caspases in cancer therapeutics.', ""3,3'-Diindolylmethane and its derivatives: nature-inspired strategies tackling drug resistant tumors by regulation of signal transduction, transcription factors and microRNAs."", 'Synthesis, β-glucuronidase inhibition and molecular docking studies of cyano-substituted bisindole hydrazone hybrids.', 'Modulation of aryl hydrocarbon receptor inhibits esophageal squamous cell carcinoma progression by repressing COX2/PGE2/STAT3 axis.', 'Autophagy inhibition improves the chemotherapeutic efficacy of cruciferous vegetable-derived diindolymethane in a murine prostate cancer xenograft model.', 'Diindolylmethane and Lupeol Modulates Apoptosis and Cell Proliferation in N-Butyl-N-(4-Hydroxybutyl) Nitrosamine Initiated and Dimethylarsinic Acid Promoted rat Bladder Carcinogenesis.']"""

The goal of this study was to evaluate the potential use of a Lu-labeled RGD-BBN heterodimer for targeted prostate cancer therapy.  Materials and methods:   A 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid-conjugated RGD-BBN peptide (DO3A-RGD-BBN) was radiolabeled with Lu and purified by high-performance liquid chromatography. The in-vivo biodistribution study of Lu-DO3A-RGD-BBN was carried out in mice bearing human prostate cancer PC3 xenografts. The receptor-targeting specificity of the radiolabeled peptide was assayed by injecting the tracer with the unlabeled RGD-BBN peptide. Radiation absorbed doses in adult male patients, based on biodistribution data from mice, were also calculated.  Results:   DO3A-RGD-BBN peptides were successfully labeled with Lu, and high radiochemical purity (>95%) could be achieved after high-performance liquid chromatography purification. In human PC3 xenograft-bearing mice, the tumor accumulation of Lu-DO3A-RGD-BBN was 5.88±1.12, 2.77±0.30, 2.04±0.19, and 1.18±0.19%ID/g at 0.5, 2, 24, and 48 h, respectively. With rapid clearance from normal tissues, the radiolabeled probe displayed high tumor-to-blood and tumor-to-muscle ratios. On calculating the radiation absorbed doses for Lu-DO3A-RGD-BBN, we found that the prostate tumor and the pancreas were the organs receiving the highest radiation absorbed doses.

Toxicities induced by these drugs, however, including osteonecrosis of the jaw and hypocalcemia, may adversely affect therapy. The aim of this study was to identify additional therapeutic targets that can be combined with OPG/RANKL/RANK pathway inhibition in the treatment of prostate cancer bone metastasis. We established a stable transfectant that produces high levels of OPG mRNA and protein from PC-3 human prostate cancer cells (PC3-OPG). The culture medium of PC3-OPG cells significantly inhibited the differentiation of mouse monocytes into mature osteoclasts. Furthermore, when PC3-OPG cells were injected into the bones of nude mice, bone destruction and tumor-induced osteoclast formation were reduced. Injection into bone of the mixtures containing equal amounts of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing PC-3 cells (PC3-GFP) and PC3-OPG cells also reduced bone destruction, compared to the control mixture. PC3-GFP cells were subsequently isolated from bone tumors and used for microarray analysis to assess changes in gene expression following osteolytic tumor growth inhibition by OPG. We selected the top 10 upregulated genes based on results from microarrays and confirmed mRNA expression of each gene by RT-PCR. The expression patterns of retinol-binding protein 4 (RBP4) and placenta-specific 8 (PLAC8) were consistent with microarray results. Expression of these genes was also increased in the bone tumors of PC3-GFP/PC3-OPG-injected mice. Knockdown of both RBP4 and PLAC8 by siRNA inhibited the growth of PC-3 cells in vitro.

Recently, the TMPRSS2:ERG gene fusion, which results in the aberrant expression of the transcription factor ERG, has been shown to be the most common gene rearrangement in PCa. Previous studies have determined the contributions of this fusion in PCa disease initiation and/or progression in vitro and in vivo. In this study on TMPRSS2:ERG regulation in PCa, we used an androgen receptor and TMPRSS2:ERG fusion double-negative PCa cell model: PC3c. In three cell clones with different TMPRSS2:ERG expression levels, ectopic expression of the fusion resulted in significant induction of cell migration and invasion in a dose-dependent manner. In agreement with this phenotype, high-throughput microarray analysis revealed that a set of genes, functionally associated with cell motility and invasiveness, were deregulated in a dose-dependent manner in TMPRSS2:ERG-expressing cells. Importantly, we identified increased MMP9 (Metalloproteinase 9) and PLXNA2 (Plexin A2) expression in TMPRSS2:ERG-positive PCa samples, and their expression levels were significantly correlated with ERG expression in a PCa cohort. In line with these findings, there was evidence that TMPRSS2:ERG directly and positively regulates MMP9 and PLXNA2 expression in PC3c cells. Moreover, PLXNA2 upregulation contributed to TMPRSS2:ERG-mediated enhancements of PC3c cell migration and invasion. Furthermore, and importantly, PLXNA2 expression was upregulated in metastatic PCa tumors compared with localized primary PCa tumors. This study provides novel insights into the role of the TMPRSS2:ERG fusion in PCa metastasis.""","""['T V Tian', 'N Tomavo', 'L Huot', 'A Flourens', 'E Bonnelye', 'S Flajollet', 'D Hot', 'X Leroy', 'Y de Launoit', 'M Duterque-Coquillaud']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['Identification of TMPRSS2-ERG mechanisms in prostate cancer invasiveness: Involvement of MMP-9 and plexin B1.', 'Overexpression of prostate-specific TMPRSS2(exon 0)-ERG fusion transcripts corresponds with favorable prognosis of prostate cancer.', 'TMPRSS2-ERG fusion promotes prostate cancer metastases in bone.', 'Clinical applications of novel ERG immunohistochemistry in prostate cancer diagnosis and management.', 'Urine TMPRSS2: ERG Fusion Transcript as a Biomarker for Prostate Cancer: Literature Review.', 'Plexin-A2 enables the proliferation and the development of tumors from glioblastoma derived cells.', 'Extensive germline-somatic interplay contributes to prostate cancer progression through HNF1B co-option of TMPRSS2-ERG.', 'Profile of chimeric RNAs and TMPRSS2-ERG e2e4 isoform in neuroendocrine prostate cancer.', 'Downregulation of the FTO m6A RNA demethylase promotes EMT-mediated progression of epithelial tumors and sensitivity to Wnt inhibitors.', 'Transcriptomic Profiling Revealed Plexin A2 Downregulation With Migration and Invasion Alteration in Dacarbazine-Treated Primary Melanoma Cells.']"""

New nodes of therapeutic intervention are needed that can delay or combat the onset of malignancies. The antitumor properties and mechanistic functions of PD-0332991 (PD; a potent and selective CDK4/6 inhibitor) were investigated using human prostate cancer (PCa) models and primary tumors. PD significantly impaired the capacity of PCa cells to proliferate by promoting a robust G1-arrest. Accordingly, key regulators of the G1-S cell cycle transition were modulated including G1 cyclins D, E and A. Subsequent investigation demonstrated the ability of PD to function in the presence of existing hormone-based regimens and to cooperate with ionizing radiation to further suppress cellular growth. Importantly, it was determined that PD is a critical mediator of PD action. The anti-proliferative impact of CDK4/6 inhibition was revealed through reduced proliferation and delayed growth using PCa cell xenografts. Finally, first-in-field effects of PD on proliferation were observed in primary human prostatectomy tumor tissue explants. This study shows that selective CDK4/6 inhibition, using PD either as a single-agent or in combination, hinders key proliferative pathways necessary for disease progression and that RB status is a critical prognostic determinant for therapeutic efficacy.

The present study investigates the influence of MMP-1, MMP-9 and TIMP-2 on different clinicopathologic variables and disease-free survival (DFS) of patients with prostate carcinoma.  Methods:   Hundred and forty-five cases are included in the study, and levels of MMP/TIMP expressions are assessed in three tissue compartments (i.e., tumor, stroma and normal glands) with immunohistochemistry.  Results:   Matrix metalloproteinase-1 expression in tumor cells was associated with lower Gleason scores, pretreatment prostate-specific antigen levels and lower incidence of vascular, perineural and extracapsular invasions. Moreover, MMP-9 positivity and TIMP-2 expression in normal glands were correlated with lower Gleason patterns and early stage at presentation. Expression of MMP in tumor cells and the presence of TIMP-2 in normal glands were associated with better DFS.

Here, we report a compound, isoangustone A (IAA) in licorice that potently suppresses the growth of aggressive prostate cancer and sought to clarify its mechanism of action. We analyzed its inhibitory effects on the growth of PTEN-deleted human prostate cancer cells, in vitro and in vivo. Administration of IAA significantly attenuated the growth of prostate cancer cell cultures and xenograft tumors. These effects were found to be attributable to inhibition of the G1/S phase cell cycle transition and the accumulation of p27(kip1). The elevated p27(kip1) expression levels were concurrent with the decrease of its phosphorylation at threonine 187 through suppression of CDK2 kinase activity and the reduced phosphorylation of Akt at Serine 473 by diminishing the kinase activity of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Further analysis using recombinant proteins and immunoprecipitated cell lysates determined that IAA exerts suppressive effects against CDK2 and mTOR kinase activity by direct binding with both proteins. These findings suggested that the licorice compound IAA is a potent molecular inhibitor of CDK2 and mTOR, with strong implications for the treatment of prostate cancer.

Methods:   Serum β2M levels in 120 patients with PCa, 50 patients with benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) and 85 healthy age-matched controls were measured by enzyme immunoassay. The correlation of serum β2M with the clinicopathological features, therapy efficacy and the prognosis of PCa were subsequently assessed.  Results:   Our results showed that: (i) PCa patients had significantly higher levels of β2M compared to those of patients with BPH or those of healthy controls.

Materials and methods:   We analyzed the records of 1,476 patients without a history of prostatic adenocarcinoma. We determined the incidence of clinically significant prostatic adenocarcinoma, prostatic urothelial carcinoma and HGPIN in the total cohort and in select patient subgroups. Prostatic urothelial carcinoma was stratified as prostatic stromal and prostatic urethral/duct involvement. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed with multiple variables. Recurrence-free and overall survival rates were calculated. Median followup was 13.2 years.  Results:   Of the 1,476 patients 753 (51.0%) had cancer involving the prostate. Prostatic adenocarcinoma, clinically significant prostatic adenocarcinoma, prostatic urothelial carcinoma and HGPIN were present in 37.9%, 8.3%, 21.1% and 51.2% of patients, respectively. Of the 312 patients (21.1%) with prostatic urothelial carcinoma 163 (11.0%) had prostatic urethral/duct involvement only and 149 (10.1%) had prostatic stromal involvement. We identified risk factors for clinically significant prostatic adenocarcinoma, prostatic urothelial carcinoma and HGPIN but the absence of these risk factors did not rule out their presence. Ten-year overall survival in patients with no prostatic urothelial carcinoma, and prostatic urethral/duct and prostatic stromal involvement was 47.1%, 43.3% and 21.7%, respectively (p<0.001).

Conclusions:   More than half of the patients undergoing radical cystoprostatectomy had cancer involving the prostate. Prostatic urothelial carcinoma, particularly with prostatic stromal involvement, was associated with a worse prognosis, while clinically significant prostatic adenocarcinoma did not alter survival.

These side effects may be avoided through the use of new drug delivery systems such as nanoparticles, and paclitaxel-loaded PLGA nanoparticles up to 200 nm in size have shown encouraging results. As it is known that size affects the tissular penetration and distribution of tumors via the enhanced permeability and retention effect, so nanoparticles smaller than 100 nm are potentially interesting vehicles for improving paclitaxel delivery and efficacy. In this work, new paclitaxel-loaded small PLGA nanoparticles, between 49 nm and 95 nm in size and with positive or negative surface charges, were prepared without detergent. They were stable in the presence of serum, and HPLC showed that high paclitaxel loading and stability were achieved. Intracellular uptake of these nanoparticles was studied in PC3 cells by flow cytometry. Confocal studies confirmed a high tubulin destructuration at very low dose with these nanoparticles. This study suggests that both positively and negatively charged paclitaxel-loaded small PLGA nanoparticles deliver this drug into PC3 cells, and that this nanoparticle mode of delivery highly improves paclitaxel efficiency by up to two log-increase.

Methods:   We used linked Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare data to identify 149,354 men diagnosed with prostate cancer from 1992 to 2007. Of those, 2,237 men (1.5%) underwent testosterone replacement therapy before their prostate cancer diagnosis. Propensity scoring methods were used to assess cancer-specific outcomes of testosterone replacement vs no replacement therapy.  Results:   Testosterone replacement was associated with older age at cancer diagnosis, nonwhite race, and higher comorbidity (P <.001). No testosterone vs testosterone before the prostate cancer diagnosis was associated with higher grade (34% vs 30%, P <.0001) and more T4 (6.5% vs 4.3%, P <.0001) tumors. Mortality was decreased in men with ≥2 prostate-specific antigen (PSA) tests in the year before their cancer diagnosis. No significant difference was found between groups in overall survival, cancer-specific survival, or use of salvage androgen-deprivation therapy after initial treatment.  Conclusion:   Through our observational study design, we show that testosterone use was low throughout the study period. Testosterone use was not associated with aggressive prostate cancer and did not affect overall or disease-specific mortality.

Methods:   The medical records of patients enrolled in CaPSURE between 1999 and 2011 were evaluated. Baseline demographics, disease features, and imaging use were assessed. Mantel-Haenszel chi-square was used to test for trends across diagnostic years.  Results:   Between 1999 and 2011, a total of 9572 patients were diagnosed with prostate cancer and enrolled in CaPSURE at community (36), academic (3), and Veteran's Affairs (4) hospitals. Over the study period, mean age at diagnosis decreased, P <.01. In 2008-2011, a significant increase in diagnostic Gleason 7 or higher was observed relative to 1999-2001 (50% vs 36%, P <.01), congruent with recent guideline modifications of the Gleason classification system. An increase in the mean number of diagnostic biopsy cores (13.3 vs 8.3, P <.01) was also observed. A significant decrease in use of any imaging modality was seen (19% vs 45%, P <.01).

For delineation of the prostate several publications have shown decreased delineation variability using MR compared to computed tomography (CT). The purpose of the present work was to investigate the intra- and inter-physician delineation variability for prostate and seminal vesicles, and to investigate the influence of different MR sequence settings used clinically at the five centers participating in the study.  Methods:   MR series from five centers, each providing five patients, were used. Two physicians from each center delineated the prostate and the seminal vesicles on each of the 25 image sets. The variability between the delineations was analyzed with respect to overall, intra- and inter-physician variability, and dependence between variability and origin of the MR images, i.e. the MR sequence used to acquire the data.  Results:   The intra-physician variability in different directions was between 1.3 - 1.9 mm and 3 - 4 mm for the prostate and seminal vesicles respectively (1 std). The inter-physician variability for different directions were between 0.7 - 1.7 mm and approximately equal for the prostate and seminal vesicles. Large differences in variability were observed for individual patients, and also for individual imaging sequences used at the different centers. There was however no indication of decreased variability with higher field strength.  Conclusion:   The overall delineation variability is larger for the seminal vesicles compared to the prostate, due to a larger intra-physician variability. The imaging sequence appears to have a large influence on the variability, even for different variants of the T2-weighted spin-echo based sequences, which were used by all centers in the study.""","""['Tufve Nyholm', 'Joakim Jonsson', 'Karin Söderström', 'Per Bergström', 'Andreas Carlberg', 'Gunilla Frykholm', 'Claus F Behrens', 'Poul Flemming Geertsen', 'Redas Trepiakas', 'Scott Hanvey', 'Azmat Sadozye', 'Jawaher Ansari', 'Hazel McCallum', 'John Frew', 'Rhona McMenemin', 'Björn Zackrisson']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Radiat Oncol""","""['Definition of the prostate in CT and MRI: a multi-observer study.', 'Intra- and inter-observer variability in contouring prostate and seminal vesicles: implications for conformal treatment planning.', 'Magnetic resonance imaging in the radiation treatment planning of localized prostate cancer using intra-prostatic fiducial markers for computed tomography co-registration.', 'Seminal vesicle inter- and intra-fraction motion during radiotherapy for prostate cancer: A review.', 'Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) anatomy of the prostate and application of MRI in radiotherapy planning.', 'Accuracy of deformable image registration-based intra-fraction motion management in Magnetic Resonance-guided radiotherapy.', ""Parameters from site classification to harmonize MRI clinical studies: Application to a multi-site Parkinson's disease dataset."", 'Federated learning for multi-center imaging diagnostics: a simulation study in cardiovascular disease.', 'Dosimetric impact of deep learning-based CT auto-segmentation on radiation therapy treatment planning for prostate cancer.', 'The impact of image acquisition time on registration, delineation and image quality for magnetic resonance guided radiotherapy of prostate cancer patients.']"""

Our current study attempted to further verify our previous observations and determine the primary type(s) of infiltrating immune cells and the possible mechanism associated with physical destructions of the epithelial capsules.  Methods:   In total, the study was conducted with 250 primary breast and prostate tumors, the primary immune cell of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTL), Natural killer cells (NK) and Mast cells were analyzed by immunohistochemistry, fluorescent labeling and apoptosis assay. qRT-PCR was used for gene expression analysis. Our current study assessed the physical disruption of these immune cells and potential impact on the epithelial capsule of human breast and prostate tumors.  Results:   Our study yield several clinically-relevant findings that have not been studied before. (1) A vast majority of these infiltrating immune cells are distributed in the normal-appearing or pre-invasive tissue components rather than in invasive cancer tissues. (2) These cells often form rings or semilunar structures that either surround focally-disrupted basal cell layers or physically attach to the basal cells. (3) Basal cells physically associated with these immune cells generally displayed distinct signs of degeneration, including substantially elevated apoptosis, necrosis, and reduced tumor suppressor p63 expression. In contrast, luminal cells overlying focally disrupted basal cell layers had a substantially increased proliferation rate and elevated expression of stem cell markers compared to their adjacent morphologically similar counterparts that overlie a non-disrupted capsule.  Conclusion:   Our findings suggest that at the early stage of tumor invasion, CTL, NK and Mast cells are the main types of tumor infiltrating immune cells involved in focal degenerative products in the tumor capsules. The primary impact of these infiltrating immune cells is that they are associated with focal disruptions of the tumor capsule, which selectively favor tumor stem cells proliferation and invasion.""","""['Hongyan Yuan', 'Yi-Hsuan Hsiao', 'Yiyu Zhang', 'Jinlian Wang', 'Chao Yin', 'Rong Shen', 'Yiping Su']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Differential impact of tumor-infiltrating immune cells on basal and luminal cells: implications for tumor invasion and metastasis.', 'Focal degeneration of basal cells and the resultant auto-immunoreactions: a novel mechanism for prostate tumor progression and invasion.', 'Tumor-infiltrating immune cells: triggers for tumor capsule disruption and tumor progression?', 'The role of stromal mast cells in the modification of CD4+CD25+Foxp³ regulatory T cells, Th17 lymphocytes and cytotoxic lymphocytes Tc1 in the development and progression of tumor.', 'Mast cells as a potential prognostic marker in prostate cancer.', 'Targeting the chromatin effector Pygo2 promotes cytotoxic T cell responses and overcomes immunotherapy resistance in prostate cancer.', 'The most effective but largely ignored target for prostate cancer early detection and intervention.', 'Mast cell density in the primary tumor predicts lymph node metastases in patients with breast cancer.', 'Clinicopathological characteristics and prognostic analysis of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and DCIS with microinvasion (DCIS-Mi) of the breast.', 'Mast Cell-Tumor Interactions: Molecular Mechanisms of Recruitment, Intratumoral Communication and Potential Therapeutic Targets for Tumor Growth.']"""
