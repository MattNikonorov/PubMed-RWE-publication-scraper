Although developed to overcome resistance to conventional chemotherapy, metronomic chemotherapy is subject to resistance on its own. However, there is a paucity of information on mechanisms of resistance, on cross-resistance between metronomic regimens using different cytotoxic drugs, and on cross-resistance between metronomic versus conventional chemotherapy, or versus targeted antiangiogenic therapy. Herein we show that PC-3 human prostate cancer xenografts were sensitive to both metronomic cyclophosphamide and metronomic docetaxel, but resistant to metronomic topotecan. Conventional docetaxel was only moderately active in parental PC-3 and in metronomic cyclophosphamide resistant PC-3 tumors. However, in metronomic cyclophosphamide resistant PC-3 tumors combining conventional docetaxel or bolus cyclophosphamide therapy with continued metronomic cyclophosphamide was superior to each treatment alone. Furthermore, bevacizumab had single-agent activity against metronomic cyclophosphamide resistant PC-3 tumors. Microarray analyses identified altered regulation of protein translation as a potential mechanism of resistance to metronomic cyclophosphamide. Our results suggest that sensitivity to metronomic chemotherapy regimens using different cytotoxic drugs not only depends on shared mechanisms of action such as antiangiogenesis, but also on as yet unknown additional antitumor effects that appear to be drug-specific. As clinically observed with targeted antiangiogenic agents, the continued use of metronomic chemotherapy beyond progression may amplify the effects of added second-line therapies or vice versa. However, metronomic chemotherapy is no different from other systemic therapies in that predictive biomarkers will be essential to fully exploit this novel use of conventional chemotherapeutics.""","""['Annabelle Chow', 'Amy Wong', 'Giulio Francia', 'Shan Man', 'Robert S Kerbel', 'Urban Emmenegger']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Invest New Drugs""","""['Potent preclinical impact of metronomic low-dose oral topotecan combined with the antiangiogenic drug pazopanib for the treatment of ovarian cancer.', 'Analysis of acquired resistance to metronomic oral topotecan chemotherapy plus pazopanib after prolonged preclinical potent responsiveness in advanced ovarian cancer.', 'Tumors that acquire resistance to low-dose metronomic cyclophosphamide retain sensitivity to maximum tolerated dose cyclophosphamide.', ""The potential clinical promise of 'multimodality' metronomic chemotherapy revealed by preclinical studies of metastatic disease."", 'Low-dose metronomic chemotherapy: a systematic literature analysis.', 'Metronomic Anti-Cancer Therapy: A Multimodal Therapy Governed by the Tumor Microenvironment.', 'Metronomic chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide plus low dose of corticosteroids in advanced castration-resistant prostate cancer across the era of taxanes and new hormonal drugs.', 'Clinical response in patients with ovarian cancer treated with metronomic chemotherapy.', 'Resistance to metronomic chemotherapy and ways to overcome it.', 'Impact of CTLA-4 blockade in conjunction with metronomic chemotherapy on preclinical breast cancer growth.']"""

The GRPR ligands gastrin releasing peptide and bombesin can play a very significant role in cancer therapy and diagnostics. In this study we synthesized unlabeled bombesin BBN along with two conjugates in which the correct bombesin (BBN-Rhd) and a mutant bombesin (mBBN-Rhd) sequence was coupled to rhodamine, a fluorescent dye. These novel rhodamine fluorescent conjugates were used to study the targeting and uptake of bombesin on a cellular level. Nine different human cell lines including both tumor and healthy cells were examined using flow cytometry and confocal laser scanning microscopy. GRPR mRNA expression analysis was performed and it was found that the receptor is highly expressed in LNCaP and PC3 cells compared to the rest of other cell lines. Competition experiments were performed to verify the receptor dependence of the labeled conjugates using unmarked bombesin. The present study is a first attempt at direct fluorescence imaging of living cells using bombesin and its target, the GRPR.

In contrast to approaches of using side populations and cell-surface markers to isolate and characterize the putative PCSC, we hypothesize that androgen deprivation leads to functional enrichment of putative PCSC.  Methods and results:   Human prostate cancer lines LNCaP, LAPC4 and LAPC9 were depleted of androgen in cell cultures and in castrated SCID mice. The resultant androgen deprivation-resistant or castration-resistant populations, in particular in LNCaP and its derivative cell lines, displayed increased expression of pluripotency transactivators and significantly higher tumorigenicity. Individual tumor cell clones were isolated from castration-resistant bulk cultures of LNCaP (CR-LNCaP) and tested for tumorigenicity in male SCID mice under limiting dilution conditions. As few as 200 cells were able to form spheres in vitro, and generate tumors with similar growth kinetics as 10(6) LNCaP or 10(4) CR-LNCaP cells in vivo. These putative PCSC were CD44(+) /CD24(-) and lack the expression of prostate lineage proteins. When transplanted into the prostate of an intact male SCID mouse, these putative PCSC seemed to show limited differentiation into Ck5(+) , Ck8(+) , Ck5(+) /Ck8(+) , and AR(+) cells. On the other hand, stable transduction of LNCaP with retrovirus encoding Sox2 led to androgen-deprivation resistant growth and down-regulation of major prostate lineage gene products in vitro.  Conclusion:   Concurrence of overexpression of pluripotency transactivators and resistance to androgen deprivation supported the role of putative PCSC in the emergence of prostate cancer resistant to androgen deprivation.""","""['Daniel Seiler', 'Junying Zheng', 'Gentao Liu', 'Shunyou Wang', 'Joyce Yamashiro', 'Robert E Reiter', 'Jiaoti Huang', 'Gang Zeng']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Establishment and characterization of androgen-independent human prostate cancer cell lines, LN-REC4 and LNCaP-SF, from LNCaP.', 'Androgen deprivation induces selective outgrowth of aggressive hormone-refractory prostate cancer clones expressing distinct cellular and molecular properties not present in parental androgen-dependent cancer cells.', 'Down-regulation of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase 2 by androgen deprivation induces castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptor and prostate cancer stem cells: biological mechanisms and clinical implications.', 'Prostate cancer stem cells: the role of androgen and estrogen receptors.', 'The driver role of JAK-STAT signalling in cancer stemness capabilities leading to new therapeutic strategies for therapy- and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'BAZ2A-mediated repression via H3K14ac-marked enhancers promotes prostate cancer stem cells.', 'Crosstalk Between AR and Wnt Signaling Promotes Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Growth.', 'Cellular and Molecular Mechanisms Underlying Prostate Cancer Development: Therapeutic Implications.', 'Identification of an IL-1-induced gene expression pattern in AR+ PCa cells that mimics the molecular phenotype of AR- PCa cells.']"""

To identify very old candidates for radical prostatectomy with the highest probability of long-term survival, we studied 47 consecutive men who underwent radical prostatectomy between 1992 and 2005 at an age of 75 years or older. A heuristic approach was used to search for subgroups with particularly high long-term survival. Several two-sided comorbidity measures and combinations of these measures were investigated to find classifications best identifying healthy, long-living elderly candidates for radical prostatectomy. Four of the 25 two-sided comorbidity classifications or combinations reached the significance level with hazard ratios between 4.00 and 4.80. After 10 years, patients identified as healthy patients according to these comorbidity measurements had exhibited relative survival rates between 129% and 137% and overall survival rates between 86% and 95%, whereas those with comorbidities had exhibited relative survival rates of only 66%-84% and overall survival rates of 44%-58%.

Src inhibitors are currently being tested in clinical trials for such diseases. Understanding the molecular and cellular actions of Src inhibitors holds the key to future improvement of this line of therapy. Here we describe the microRNA expression profiles modulated by two Src inhibitors and demonstrate that the miR-30 family members are the most prominently induced species. Consistent with its tumor suppressor role, miR-30 is downmodulated by oncogenic signals such as epidermal growth factor (EGF) and hepatocyte growth factor, and is generally underexpressed in prostate cancer specimens. A number of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-associated genes are predicted targets of miR-30. Among these genes the Ets-related gene (ERG) is the most frequently overexpressed oncogene in prostate cancer activated by genomic fusion events between promoter upstream sequences of the TMPRSS2 and coding sequences of ERG. We showed by ERG 3' untranslated region reporter and mutagenesis assays that ERG is a direct target of miR-30. Overexpression of miR-30 in prostate cancer cells suppresses EMT phenotypes and inhibits cell migration and invasion. It also inhibits the in vitro and in vivo growth of VCaP cells, which depends on TMPRSS2-ERG for proliferation. TMPRSS2-ERG is generally regulated by androgen at the transcriptional level.

Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) force a malignant cross talk with cancer cells, culminating in their epithelial-mesenchymal transition and achievement of stemness traits. Herein, we demonstrate that stromal tumor-associated cells cooperate to favor malignancy of prostate carcinoma (PCa). Indeed, prostate CAFs are active factors of monocyte recruitment toward tumor cells, mainly acting through stromal-derived growth factor-1 delivery and promote their trans-differentiation toward the M2 macrophage phenotype. The relationship between M2 macrophages and CAFs is reciprocal, as M2 macrophages are able to affect mesenchymal-mesenchymal transition of fibroblasts, leading to their enhanced reactivity. On the other side, PCa cells themselves participate in this cross talk through secretion of monocyte chemotactic protein-1, facilitating monocyte recruitment and again macrophage differentiation and M2 polarization. Finally, this complex interplay among cancer cells, CAFs and M2 macrophages, cooperates in increasing tumor cell motility, ultimately fostering cancer cells escaping from primary tumor and metastatic spread, as well as in activation of endothelial cells and their bone marrow-derived precursors to drive de novo angiogenesis. In keeping with our data obtained in vitro, the analysis of patients affected by prostate cancers at different clinical stages revealed a clear increase in the M2/M1 ratio in correlation with clinical values.

Among these the calcium-binding annexin A1 protein (ANXA1) was chosen for further characterization given its role in protein secretion and cancer. SUMOylation of ANXA1 was confirmed by overexpressing SUMO-1 in LNCaP cells. Site-directed mutagenesis indicated that K257 located in a SUMOylation consensus motif in the C-terminal calcium-binding DA3 repeat domain is SUMOylated. Mutation of the N-terminal Y21 decreased markedly the SUMOylation signal while EGF stimulation increased ANXA1 SUMOylation. A structural analysis of ANXA1 revealed that K257 is located in a hot spot where Ca(2+) and SUMO-1 bind and where a nuclear export signal and a polyubiquitination site are also present. Also, Y21 is buried inside an α-helix structure in the Ca(2+)-free conformation implying that Ca(2+) binding, and the subsequent expelling of the N-terminal α-helix in a disordered conformation, is permissive for its phosphorylation. These results show for the first time that SUMOylation can be regulated by an external signal (EGF) and indicate the presence of a cross-talk between the N-terminal and C-terminal domains of ANXA1 through post-translational modifications.""","""['Danielle Caron', 'Halim Maaroufi', 'Sébastien Michaud', 'Robert M Tanguay', 'Robert L Faure']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Cell Signal""","""['The complex understanding of Annexin A1 phosphorylation.', 'Ubiquitination and SUMOylation of annexin A1 and helicase activity.', 'Molecular dynamic studies on the impact of mutations on the structure, stability, and N-terminal orientation of annexin A1: implications for membrane aggregation.', 'Specific association of annexin 1 with plasma membrane-resident and internalized EGF receptors mediated through the protein core domain.', 'Annexin A1 localization and its relevance to cancer.', 'Sirtuin 5 aggravates microglia-induced neuroinflammation following ischaemic stroke by modulating the desuccinylation of Annexin-A1.', 'SENP6 induces microglial polarization and neuroinflammation through de-SUMOylation of Annexin-A1 after cerebral ischaemia-reperfusion injury.', 'Annexin A1 Is a Potential Prognostic Marker for, and Enhances the Metastasis of, Cholangiocarcinoma.', 'Inhibition of SENP6 restrains cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury by regulating Annexin-A1 nuclear translocation-associated neuronal apoptosis.', 'Membrane-cytoplasm translocation of annexin A4 is involved in the metastasis of colorectal carcinoma.']"""

However, limited data exist on natural history, specifically in men with extraprostatic extension, and wide variability in outcomes has been reported. We evaluated long-term outcomes in patients with pT3aN0 disease and determined predictors of recurrence in these men.  Materials and methods:   We evaluated 20,744 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy at our clinic between 1987 and 2011. Of these men 1,073 with pT3aN0 disease were identified who did not receive neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy. Biochemical recurrence-free survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Multivariate stepwise selection was used to develop a prognostic model for biochemical recurrence.  Results:   Median followup after radical prostatectomy was 10.9 years, during which 449 patients experienced biochemical recurrence. On stepwise selection preoperative prostate specific antigen (HR 1.3, p=0.0003), clinical tumor stage (HR 1.2, p=0.001), pathological Gleason score (HR 1.9, p<0.0001), surgical margin status (HR 1.6, p<0.0001) and detectable first postoperative prostate specific antigen (HR 2.2, p<0.0001) were significantly associated with biochemical recurrence. Cumulative weighted scores of these variables were used to stratify patients into quintiles according to biochemical recurrence risk. The 15-year biochemical recurrence-free survival rate in the lowest to the highest risk group was 70%, 56%, 44%, 34% and 25%, respectively (p<0.0001). The c-index for this model was 0.69.

Materials and methods:   Prospectively 583 patients who underwent multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging and subsequent prostate biopsy at a single institution were evaluated. On multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging, lesions were identified and scored as low, moderate or high suspicion for prostate cancer based on a validated scoring system. Magnetic resonance/ultrasound fusion guided biopsies of magnetic resonance imaging lesions in addition to systematic 12-core biopsies were performed. Correlations between the highest assigned multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging suspicion score and presence of cancer and biopsy Gleason score on the first fusion biopsy session were assessed using univariate and multivariate logistic regression models. Sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value and positive predictive value were calculated and ROC curves were developed to assess the discriminative ability of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging as a diagnostic tool for various biopsy Gleason score cohorts.  Results:   Significant correlations were found between age, prostate specific antigen, prostate volume, and multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging suspicion score and the presence of prostate cancer (p<0.0001). On multivariate analyses controlling for age, prostate specific antigen and prostate volume, increasing multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging suspicion was an independent prognosticator of prostate cancer detection (OR 2.2, p<0.0001). Also, incremental increases in multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging suspicion score demonstrated stronger associations with cancer detection in patients with Gleason 7 or greater (OR 3.3, p<0.001) and Gleason 8 or greater (OR 4.2, p<0.0001) prostate cancer. Assessing multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging as a diagnostic tool for all prostate cancer, biopsy Gleason score 7 or greater, and biopsy Gleason score 8 or greater separately via ROC analyses demonstrated increasing accuracy of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging for higher grade disease (AUC 0.64, 0.69, and 0.72, respectively).

We examined contemporary trends in active surveillance and watchful waiting in the nationwide Swedish prostate cancer registry. We also examined factors associated with selection of deferred management, which might provide insight into the rational diffusion of this important management strategy.  Materials and methods:   We identified 57,713 men with very low risk (T1c, Gleason 6 or less, prostate specific antigen less than 10 ng/ml, prostate specific antigen density less than 0.20 ng/ml/cc, 2 or fewer positive biopsy cores or less than 25% of cores positive), low risk (T1-T2, Gleason 6 or less, and prostate specific antigen less than 10 ng/ml) and intermediate risk prostate cancer (T1-T2, Gleason 7 and/or prostate specific antigen 10 to 20 ng/ml) in the PCBaSe (Prostate Cancer database Sweden) from 1998 to 2011. Subclassification of very low risk disease, and active surveillance vs watchful waiting was possible beginning in 2007. We examined primary treatment selection by risk group and used logistic regression to evaluate factors associated with deferred treatment.  Results:   Overall 13,272 (46%) men with low risk and 8,695 (30%) with intermediate risk prostate cancer chose deferred treatment. Since 2007, 59%, 41% and 16% of very low, low and intermediate risk prostate cancer, respectively, chose active surveillance. Age was by far the strongest determinant of deferred treatment. Education, marital status and comorbidity were significantly but weakly associated with deferring treatment.

Results:   Group 1 consisted of 115 (61.2%) patients and group 2 included 73 (38.8%) patients. In group 1 magnetic resonance imaging was normal in 72 patients.

Age, race, hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, serum hormones and anthropometric parameters were also evaluated. Risk factors for erectile dysfunction were identified by logistic regression. The 333 men with at least mild to moderate erectile dysfunction (IIEF 16 or less) were included in a latent class model to identify relationships across erectile dysfunction risk factors.  Results:   Age, hypertension, diabetes, lower urinary tract symptoms and cardiovascular event were independent predictors of erectile dysfunction (p<0.05). We identified 3 latent classes of patients with erectile dysfunction (R2 entropy=0.82). Latent class 1 had younger men at low cardiovascular risk and a moderate/high prevalence of lower urinary tract symptoms.

Conclusions:   Risk factor interactions determined different severities of lower urinary tract symptoms and erectile dysfunction. The effect of lower urinary tract symptoms and cardiovascular risk outweighed that of age.

Methods:   In a single patient, an extended PLND was performed before prostatectomy. The external iliac lymph node (LN) group was dissected from the node of Cloquet to the ureteric crossing over the internal iliac artery. The vas deferens was then transected along its course medial to the external iliac artery. The vas deferens was subsequently grasped with bipolar forceps, passed under the external iliac vessels, lifted superiorly, and retracted medially in order to apply medial traction to the obturator nerve and external iliac artery and vein.  Results:   Retraction using the vas deferens permitted excellent visualization of the LN packets. The iliac vessels and obturator nerve were maintained far from the plane of the dissection and were retracted only using the vas deferens. This technique yielded 25 LNs and our median LN yield for high-risk individuals is 20. Surgical time was comparable to PLNDs performed using instruments for retraction.  Conclusion:   Use of the vas deferens for retraction during an extended PLND can be an excellent method to improve visibility without risk of damage to important structures with surgical tools and still achieve an adequate LN yield. Use of this technique in future surgeries will permit a more detailed understanding of outcomes.""","""['Wesley Ludwig', 'Ashutosh Tewari']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Urology""","""['Topography of lymph node metastases in prostate cancer patients undergoing radical prostatectomy and extended lymphadenectomy: results of a combined molecular and histopathologic mapping study.', 'Assessment of required nodal yield in a high risk cohort undergoing extended pelvic lymphadenectomy in robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy and its impact on functional outcomes.', 'Laparoscopic extended pelvic lymph node dissection for prostate cancer: description of the surgical technique and initial results.', 'Anatomical extent of pelvic lymphadenectomy in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy.', 'Lymph node dissection during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: where do we stand?', 'Extended versus limited pelvic lymph node dissection during bilateral nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy and its effect on continence and erectile function recovery: long-term results and trifecta rates of a comparative analysis.', 'Topographical relationships between the obturator nerve, artery, and vein in the lateral pelvic wall.']"""

The purpose of this work was to analyze if the combination of an androgen deprivation with the external irradiation could modify the position of the gold markers in the prostate.  Patients and methods:   Ten patients have been treated for a prostate cancer, using three implanted gold markers. The variations of the intermarker distances in the prostate were measured and collected on daily OBI(®) kilovoltage images acquired at 0° and 90°. Five patients had a 6-month androgen deprivation started before the external irradiation (H group) and five did not (NH group).  Results:   A total number of 1062 distances were calculated. No distance variation greater than 3.7mm was seen between two markers, in any of the two groups. The median standard deviations of the daily intermarker distance differences were 0.7mm (range 0.3-1.2mm) for the H group and 0.6mm (range 0.2-1.2mm) for the NH group. The intermarker distances variations were noted as greater than -2mm, between -2mm and 2mm and greater than 2mm in 16.4, 83.4 and 0.2% for the H group and 1.3, 98.5 and 0.2% for the NH group, respectively.  Conclusion:   The distance variations remained less than 4mm in both groups and for all the measurements. In the NH group, the variation of the distance between two markers remained below 2mm in 98.5%.

However, whether tumour-derived long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in plasma can be used as a novel approach to detect human prostate cancer (PCa) has not yet been established. The study was divided into three parts: (1) the characteristics of PCa-related lncRNA fragments were systematically studied in the plasma or serum of 25 patients; (2) the source of the circulating lncRNA fragments was explored in vitro and in vivo; and (3) the diagnostic performance of metastasis associated in lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT-1) derived (MD) miniRNA was validated in an independent cohort of 192 patients. The expression levels of lncRNAs were measured by quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The MD-miniRNA copies were calculated using a standard curve in an area under the ROC curve (AUC)-receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Genome-wide profiling revealed that MALAT-1 and prostate cancer gene 3 (PCA3) are overexpressed in PCa tissues. Plasma lncRNAs probably exist in the form of fragments in a stable form. MD-miniRNA enters cell culture medium at measurable levels, and MD-miniRNA derived from human PCa xenografts actually enters the circulation in vivo and can be measured to distinguish xenografted mice from controls. In addition, plasma MD-miniRNA levels are significantly elevated in PCa patients compared to non-PCa patients (p<0.001). At a cut-off of 867.8 MD-miniRNA copies per microlitre of plasma, the sensitivity is 58.6%, 58.6% and 43.5% and the specificity is 84.8%, 84.8% and 81.6% for discriminating PCa from non-PCa, positive biopsy from negative biopsy and positive biopsy from negative biopsy, respectively.

We evaluated whether population-based survival improved after this policy change.  Patients and methods:   Two cohorts comprising all patients with T3-T4 prostate cancer treated with curative-intent RT in BC were reviewed. The Early cohort (n=730) was all patients treated between 1993 and 1995, and the Late cohort (n=584) was all patients treated between 1999 and 2001. The BC Cancer Registry, which collects data on survival, was linked to RT and pharmacy databases. Duration of ADT, age, stage, grade, presenting PSA, and Charlson comorbidity index (CCI; none=0, minor=1, major=2+), were abstracted from charts.  Results:   Usage of ≥6 months and ≥18 months of neoadjuvant and adjuvant ADT increased from 14% and 1% to 97% and 59% (p<0.0001). Baseline characteristics were similar, except for lower Gleason score (G2-6: 45% vs. 20%, G7: 35% vs. 48%, G8-10: 19% vs. 32%; p<0.0001), higher T-stage (T4: 9% vs. 5%, p=0.004) and higher comorbidity (CCI 0: 62% vs. 71%, CCI 1: 26% vs. 20%, CCI 2+: 11% vs. 9%, p=0.002) in the Early cohort. Disease-specific survival adjusted for competing risks from other causes mortality was improved (90% vs. 86%, p=0.042). On multivariate analysis, the Late cohort was independently associated with improved 8-year overall survival (76% vs. 64%, p=0.0002).

Methods and materials:   Nine prostate cancer patients treated at our institution were randomly selected. For the AAP method, contours on each repeat CT image were automatically generated by mapping the contours from the simulation CT image using deformable image registration.

The cumulative dose-volume histograms (DVHs) of the target and critical structures were calculated based on the manual contours for all plans and compared with those of plans generated by the conventional method, that is, shifting the isocenters by aligning the images based on the center of the volume (COV) of prostate (prostate COV-aligned).  Results:   The target coverage from our AAP method for every patient was acceptable, while 1 of the 9 patients showed target underdosing from prostate COV-aligned plans.

Main outcome measures:   Quality-adjusted life-2013s (QALYs) and costs.  Results:   The harms of screening outweighed the benefits under a number of plausible scenarios. Conclusions were sensitive to the estimated quality-of-life impacts of prostate cancer treatment as well as the incidence of cancers not detected by screening tests (poorer prognosis) and those that were detected by screening tests (better prognosis). The base-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of PSA screening was $168,611 per QALY for men with average risk, $73,452 per QALY for men with two times the average risk, and $22,938 [corrected] per QALY for men with five times the average risk.  Conclusions:   PSA screening was not found to be cost-effective for men at an average-to-high risk of prostate cancer, but may be cost-effective for men at very high risk. Inexpensive approaches for identifying men at very high risk are needed, as is further research on the size of clinical benefit of early detection in this population.

Materials and methods:   The present retrospective study was carried out at the Tata Memorial Hospital (TMH), Mumbai, India. During years 1999-2002, some 850 prostate cancer cases, including 371 new cases, treated in TMH were considered as eligible entrants for the study. Five-year survival rates using actuarial and loss-adjusted (LAR) method were estimated.  Results:   The patient population was distributed uniformly over the three age groups. A larger proportion of the patients were diagnosed at 'metastatic stage' and hormone treatment was most common. 20% patients had history of diabetes and 40% with hypertension. The 5-year overall survival rate was 64%. Survival was 55%, 74% and 52% for ' <59 years', '60-69 years' and ' >70 years' respectively. Non-diabetic (70%), hypertensive (74%), with family history (80%) of cancer, with localized-disease (91%) and treated with surgery, either alone or in combination, (91%) had better survival.

Acute testicular torsion is the most important differential diagnosis of acute testicular pain especially in younger men. If there is any suspicion of testicular torsion, the patient should be referred to secondary care immediately as surgery is required within four to six hours. Patients who are in severe pain or systemically unwell should be referred for analgesia, IV antibiotics and hydration. Examination of a patient with acute EO classically reveals a swollen, tender testis with swelling of the epididymis which starts at the lower pole and moves up towards the head of the epididymis at the upper pole of the testes.

It accounts for nearly a quarter of all male cancer diagnoses and is the second most common cause of male cancer death. Despite a large increase in prostate cancer incidence, mortality rates have remained relatively constant through improvements in survival. Most patients present with localised disease, but there are still many who present with metastatic disease. Prostate cancers are driven by androgens, such as testosterone. Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), which is still the mainstay of systemic treatment, effectively reduces intraprostatic androgen levels resulting in reduced androgen receptor (AR) stimulation and increased apoptosis. Medical castration using LHRH analogues has become the gold standard in managing both locally advanced prostate cancer, in ombination with radiotherapy, and metastatic disease. Eventually most men with advanced prostate cancer become resistant to ADT. This is now called castrate refractory prostate cancer (CRPC), and is associated with a poor prognosis. There is now hope for patients who progress after chemotherapy with the emergence of several new agents that have been shown to benefit patients. The first AR-targeted drug to show a definite clinical benefit is abiraterone. It markedly decreases levels of androgens in CRPC and initial trials showed promising activity. Enzalutamide has a high affinity and selectivity for AR binding, blocks nuclear translocation and reduces recruitment of co-activators. Abiraterone, enzalutamide and other AR-targeted drugs are being studied in clinical trials for patients earlier in their disease, e.g. in addition to ADT at first presentation of metastatic disease, where it is likely that greater benefits will be seen.""","""['Simon Chowdhury', 'Roger Kirby']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Practitioner""","""['EAU guidelines on prostate cancer.

Androgen treatment is known to affect the expression and activity of other oncogenes including receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). In this study we report that AR-positive prostate cancer cell-lines express 50% higher levels of enzymes in the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway (HBP) than AR-negative prostate cell-lines. HBP produces hexosamines that are used by endoplasmic reticulum and golgi enzymes to glycosylate proteins targeted to plasma-membrane and secretion. Inhibition of O-linked glycosylation by ST045849 or N-linked glycosylation with tunicamycin decreased cell viability by 20%. In addition, tunicamycin inhibited the androgen-induced expression of AR target genes KLK3 and CaMKK2 by 50%. RTKs have been shown to enhance AR activity and we used an antibody array to identify changes in the phosphorylation status of RTKs in response to androgen stimulation. Hormone treatment increased the activity of Insulin like Growth Factor 1-Receptor (IGF-1R) ten-fold and this was associated with a concomitant increase in the N-linked glycosylation of the receptor, analyzed by lectin enrichment experiments. Glycosylation is known to be important for the processing and stability of RTKs. Inhibition of N-linked glycosylation resulted in accumulation of IGF-1R pro-receptor with altered mobility as shown by immunoprecipitation. Confocal imaging revealed that androgen induced plasma-membrane localization of IGF-1R was blocked by tunicamycin. In conclusion we have established that the glycosylation of IGF-1R is necessary for the full activation of the receptor in response to androgen treatment and that perturbing this process can break the feedback loop between AR and IGF-1R activation in prostate cells. Achieving similar results selectively in a clinical setting will be an important challenge in the future.""","""['Harri M Itkonen', 'Ian G Mills']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Androgens up-regulate the insulin-like growth factor-I receptor in prostate cancer cells.', 'UAP1 is overexpressed in prostate cancer and is protective against inhibitors of N-linked glycosylation.', 'Inhibitory effects of nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA) on the IGF-1 receptor and androgen dependent growth of LAPC-4 prostate cancer cells.', 'Interaction of IGF signaling and the androgen receptor in prostate cancer progression.', 'Crosstalk between IGF-1R and other tumor promoting pathways.', 'Castration-resistant prostate cancer cells are dependent on the high activity of CDK7.', 'O-GlcNAc transferase maintains metabolic homeostasis in response to CDK9 inhibition.', 'O-GlcNAc transferase couples MRE11 to transcriptionally active chromatin to suppress DNA damage.', 'Fucosyltransferase 8 modulates receptor tyrosine kinase activation and temozolomide resistance in glioblastoma cells.', 'Inhibition of CDK9 activity compromises global splicing in prostate cancer cells.']"""

Acoustophoresis holds great promise as a cell separation technique in several research and clinical areas. However, it has been suggested that the force acting upon cells undergoing acoustophoresis may impact cell viability, proliferation or cell function via subtle phenotypic changes. If this were the case, it would suggest that the acoustophoresis method would be a less useful tool for many cell analysis applications as well as for cell therapy.  Methods:   We investigate, for the first time, several key aspects of cellular changes following acoustophoretic processing. We used two settings of ultrasonic actuation, one that is used for cell sorting (10 Vpp operating voltage) and one that is close to the maximum of what the system can generate (20 Vpp). We used microglial cells and assessed cell viability and proliferation, as well as the inflammatory response that is indicative of more subtle changes in cellular phenotype. Furthermore, we adapted a similar methodology to monitor the response of human prostate cancer cells to acoustophoretic processing. Lastly, we analyzed the respiratory properties of human leukocytes and thrombocytes to explore if acoustophoretic processing has adverse effects.  Results:   BV2 microglia were unaltered after acoustophoretic processing as measured by apoptosis and cell turnover assays as well as inflammatory cytokine response up to 48 h following acoustophoresis. Similarly, we found that acoustophoretic processing neither affected the cell viability of prostate cancer cells nor altered their prostate-specific antigen secretion following androgen receptor activation. Finally, human thrombocytes and leukocytes displayed unaltered mitochondrial respiratory function and integrity after acoustophoretic processing.

The classical role for sGCα1 is to heterodimerize with the sGCβ1 subunit, forming sGC, the enzyme that mediates nitric oxide signaling by catalyzing the synthesis of cyclic guanosine monophosphate. Our published data show that sGCα1 can drive prostate cancer cell proliferation independent of hormone and provide cancer cells a pro-survival function, via a novel mechanism for p53 inhibition, both of which are independent of sGCβ1, NO, and cGMP. All of these properties make sGCα1 an important novel target for prostate cancer therapy. Thus, peptides were designed targeting sGCα1 with the aim of disrupting this protein's pro-cancer activities. One peptide (A-8R) was determined to be strongly cytotoxic to prostate cancer cells, rapidly inducing apoptosis. Cytotoxicity was observed in both hormone-dependent and, significantly, hormone-refractory prostate cancer cells, opening the possibility that this peptide can be used to treat the usually lethal castration-resistant prostate cancer. In mouse xenograft studies, Peptide A-8R was able to stop tumor growth of not only hormone-dependent cells, but most importantly from hormone-independent cells. In addition, the mechanism of Peptide A cytotoxicity is generation of reactive oxygen species, which recently have been recognized as a major mode of action of important cancer drugs. Thus, this paper provides strong evidence that targeting an important AR-regulated gene is a new paradigm for effective prostate cancer therapy.""","""['Shuai Gao', 'Chen-Lin Hsieh', 'Meenakshi Bhansali', 'Archana Kannan', 'Lirim Shemshedini']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Peptide B targets soluble guanylyl cyclase α1 and kills prostate cancer cells.', 'Androgen regulation of soluble guanylyl cyclasealpha1 mediates prostate cancer cell proliferation.', 'Soluble guanylyl cyclase α1 and p53 cytoplasmic sequestration and down-regulation in prostate cancer.', 'What is next in nitric oxide research?

Previous studies have reported the existence of HIF1A P582S and A588T missense polymorphisms in renal, urothelial and prostatic carcinomas, however the effects remain conflicting. Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis to assess the association between these sites and the susceptibility of urinary cancers.  Methods:   We searched the PubMed database without limits on language until Nov 25, 2012 for studies exploring the relationship of HIF1A P582S and A588T polymorphisms and urinary cancers. Still, article search was supplemented by screening the references of retrieved studies manually. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated to evaluate the strength of the associations between the two by RevMan 5.0 software. Simultaneously, publication bias was estimated by funnel plot and Begg's test with Stata 12.1 software.  Results:   Overall, 11 individual case-control studies with 5195 cases and 5786 controls for P582S polymorphism, and 9 studies with 3482 cases and 4304 controls for A588T polymorphism were respectively included in the final meta-analysis.

The J-CaP and CaPSURE Joint Initiative was established in 2007 with the objective of analyzing, reviewing, comparing and contrasting data for prostate cancer patients from Japan and the USA within the two important large-scale, longitudinal, observational databases-J-CaP and CaPSURE. Since this initial collaboration between teams in the USA and Japan, the initiative has now expanded to include representatives of other Asian countries, several of whom have either established or are planning their own national prostate cancer databases. Several key topics were considered at this Sixth Joint Meeting including the current status of the J-CaP and CaPSURE databases and opportunities for collaboration with the more recently developed Asian prostate cancer databases. The latest comparative data from J-CaP and CaPSURE regarding outcomes following androgen deprivation therapy and combined androgen blockade were also reviewed. The possibility of a global chemoprevention trial to investigate the influence of soy isoflavones on prostate cancer incidence was considered. In addition, the ongoing debate regarding the role of screening and the use of active surveillance as a treatment option in the USA was discussed. The collaborators agreed that sharing of data and treatment practices on a global scale would undoubtedly benefit the clinical management of prostate cancer patients worldwide.""","""['Hideyuki Akaza', 'Shiro Hinotsu', 'Matthew R Cooperberg', 'Byung-Ha Chung', 'Ji Youl Lee', 'Rainy Umbas', 'Taiji Tsukamoto', 'Mikio Namiki', 'Peter Carroll']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Jpn J Clin Oncol""","""['Seventh Joint Meeting of K-J-CaP and CaPSURE: extending the global initiative to improve prostate cancer management.', 'Fifth Joint Meeting of J-CaP and CaPSURE: advancing the global understanding of prostate cancer and its management.', 'Trans-Pacific variation in outcomes for men treated with primary androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) for prostate cancer.', 'Combined androgen blockade: the gold standard for metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer chemoprevention: current status and future directions for agent development.', 'The Use of Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT) and Chemotherapeutic Agents in New Zealand Men with Prostate Cancer.', 'Asian trends in primary androgen depletion therapy on prostate cancer.']"""

Plasma concentrations of cytokines may be related to these symptoms, but few studies have examined these relationships. The study purpose was to explore the association between prostate cancer symptoms and cytokine levels at pretreatment and posttreatment.  Method:   In this longitudinal, correlational study, 29 men with nonmetastatic prostate cancer completed symptom questionnaires at preradiation and postradiation treatment. Blood drawn at these same time points was used to determine levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukins-1β, 6, 10, and 4 (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, and IL-4).  Results:   Men reported symptom severity at pretreatment and posttreatment as low to moderate. There were significant differences from pretreatment to posttreatment in fatigue, insomnia, urinary irritative and incontinence, bowel, sexual, and hormonal problems. There were no significant differences in TNF-α, IL-6, IL-10, or IL-4. At pretreatment, TNF-α was associated with depression, anxiety, urinary irritative, and bowel problems, and IL-4 was related to urinary irritative symptoms. At posttreatment, IL-4 was associated with urinary irritative symptoms. Findings suggest that, in men with prostate cancer, there is no strong association between symptom reporting and cytokine levels. Ongoing research focused on neuroendocrine and genetic markers and their associations with symptoms is promising and may result in the provision of better markers for quantifying the symptom experience in patients with cancer.""","""['Shannon Ruff Dirksen', 'Kenneth Ferris Kirschner', 'Michael J Belyea']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Biol Res Nurs""","""['Three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy in prostate cancer patients: rise in interleukin 6 (IL-6) but not IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, tumor necrosis factor-α, MIP-1-α, and LIF levels.', 'Transitions in Symptom Cluster Subgroups Among Men Undergoing Prostate Cancer Radiation Therapy.', 'Postsurgical Depressive Symptoms and Proinflammatory Cytokine Elevations in Women Undergoing Primary Treatment for Breast Cancer.', 'The relationship between circulating testosterone and inflammatory cytokines in men.', 'Inflammation and neural signaling: etiologic mechanisms of the cancer treatment-related symptom cluster.', 'Circulating levels of IL-6 and TGF-β1 in patients with prostate cancer undergoing radiotherapy: associations with acute radiotoxicity and fatigue symptoms.', 'Systematic review of sleep and sleep disorders among prostate cancer patients and caregivers: a call to action for using validated sleep assessments during prostate cancer care.', 'Cancer-related inflammation and depressive symptoms: Systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Abscopal Effects in Metastatic Cancer: Is a Predictive Approach Possible to Improve Individual Outcomes?', 'Neutralizing interleukin-6 in tumor-bearing mice does not abrogate behavioral fatigue induced by Lewis lung carcinoma.']"""

Two dedicated uro-pathologists, blinded to the surgeons and the operating rooms' schedules, analyzed the pathological specimens according to the Stanford protocol. Both pathologists also determined the surgical approach used based on several criteria pertaining to the pathological specimen.  Results:   Overall, 117 patients with a median age of 63 years were included.

The AR N-terminal domain (NTD) is essential for AR activity, but targeting this domain with small-molecule inhibitors is complicated by its intrinsic disorder. Here we investigated EPI-001, a small-molecule antagonist of AR NTD that inhibits protein-protein interactions necessary for AR transcriptional activity. We found that EPI analogs covalently bound the NTD to block transcriptional activity of AR and its splice variants and reduced the growth of CRPC xenografts.

This study investigated whether site-specific cancer risks are also raised following enrolment in a disease management programme for type 2 diabetes mellitus (DMP-DM2).  Methods:   We linked records from a DMP-DM2 to population cancer registry data. The study period was from June 2003 to December 2009. Standardised incidence ratios (SIRs) were calculated for time intervals following DMP enrolment using the cancer incidence rates of the general source population. Additionally, Poisson regression with natural splines was used to assess time-dependent cancer incidence by diabetes duration.  Results:   There were 2,034 first invasive cancer cases identified over 163,738 person-years of follow-up. Pancreatic cancer risk was significantly increased mainly in the first year after enrolment (SIR 1.62); the increment was only seen for patients in whom diabetes had been diagnosed less than 1 year before DMP-DM2 enrolment. Risk of endometrial cancer was similarly raised in the first year after DMP-DM2 enrolment among individuals newly diagnosed with diabetes but decreased rapidly thereafter. There was no time dependence in the incidence of cancers of the liver, lung, colon, breast and prostate.  Conclusions/interpretation:   Enrolment in a DMP-DM2 did not appear to induce ascertainment bias for most cancers. Cancer risks were initially increased, especially for pancreatic cancer, potentially as a result of reverse causality.

Serum levels of bone alkaline phosphtase (BALP), aminoterminal propeptide of procollagen type I (P1NP) and beta-isomer of carboxiterminal telopeptide of collagen I (β-CTX) were analysed at all points in the study. Data on disease progression, SREs development and survival were recorded.  Results:   Cox regression models with clinical data and bone markers showed that the levels of the three markers studied were predictive of survival time, with β-CTX being especially powerful, in which a lack of normalisation in visit 1 (3 months after the beginning of treatment) showed a 6.3-times more risk for death than in normalised patients. Levels of these markers were also predictive for SREs, although in this case BALP and P1NP proved to be better predictors. We did not find any relationship between bone markers and disease progression.  Conclusion:   In patients with PCa and bone metastases treated with ZA, β-CTX and P1NP can be considered suitable predictors for mortality risk, while BALP and P1NP are appropriate for SREs.

Three hundred and twenty-three men with an elevated PSA (≥4 ng ml⁻¹) or an abnormal DRE underwent a prostate biopsy. All men were genotyped for three founder alleles in BRCA1 (5382insC, 4153delA and C61G), for four alleles in CHEK2 (1100delC, IVS2+1G>A, del5395 and I157T), for one allele in NBS1 (657del5), for one allele in HOXB13 (G84E), and for nine low-risk single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).  Results:   On the basis of an elevated PSA or an abnormal DRE, prostate cancer was diagnosed in 135 of 2907 men (4.6%).

In a population-based study, we investigated associations between age and non-receipt of curative treatment in men with localised prostate cancer, and the effect of clinical variables on this in different age groups.  Methods:   Clinically localised prostate cancers (T1-T2N0M0) diagnosed from 2002 to 2008 among men aged ≥ 40 years, with hospital in-patient episode(s) within 1 year post-diagnosis, were included (n=5456). Clinical and socio-demographic variables were obtained from cancer registrations. Comorbidity was determined from hospital episode data. Logistic regression was used to investigate associations between age and non-receipt of treatment, adjusting for confounders; the outcome was non-receipt of curative treatment (radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy).  Results:   The percentage who did not receive curative treatment was 9.2%, 14.3%, 48.2% and 91.7% for men aged 40-59, 60-69, 70-79 and 80+ years, respectively. After adjusting for clinical and socio-demographic factors, age remained the main determinant of treatment non-receipt. Men aged 70-79 had a significant five-fold increased risk of not having curative treatment compared with men aged 60-69 (odds ratio (OR)=5.5; 95% confidence interval 4.7, 6.5). In age-stratified analyses, clinical factors had a higher weight for men aged 60-69 than in other age strata. Over time, non-receipt of curative treatment increased among men aged 40-59 and decreased among men aged 70-79.  Conclusion:   Age remains the dominant factor in determining non-receipt of curative treatment.

Along with cancer centre volume, we examined each indicator's association with relevant outcomes: long-term cause-specific survival, urinary incontinence, and gastrointestinal and genitourinary late morbidities.  Materials and methods:   We conducted a population-based retrospective cohort study of 924 prostate cancer patients diagnosed between 1990 and 1998 who received RT within 9 months of diagnosis.

The associations between indicators and outcomes were analysed using regression techniques to control for potential confounders.  Results:   Practice patterns varied across the regional cancer centres for all indicators (p<0.0001). Incomplete pre-treatment assessment was associated with worse cause-specific survival although this result was not significant when adjusted for confounding (adjusted RR=1.78, 95% CI=0.79-3.98).

The evidence of the optimal age to stop screening, however, is limited.  Objective:   To examine the risk of PCa after the discontinuation of screening.  Design, setting, and participants:   In December 1994, 20 000 men in Göteborg, Sweden, between the ages of 50 and 65 yr were randomised to a screening arm (invited biennially to PSA testing) and a control arm (not invited). At the upper age limit (average: 69 yr), a total of 13 423 men (6449 and 6974 in the screening and control arms, respectively) were still alive without PCa. The incidence of PCa hereafter was established by matching with the Western Swedish Cancer Register. Participants were followed until a diagnosis of PCa, death, or final follow-up on June 30, 2012, or for a maximum of 12 yr after the last invitation.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Incidence rates and disease-free survival were calculated with life table models and Kaplan-Meier estimates. A competing risk model was also applied.  Results and limitations:   Postscreening, 173 cases of PCa were diagnosed in the screening arm (median follow-up: 4.8 yr) and 371 in the control arm (median follow-up: 4.9 yr). Up to 9 yr postscreening, all risk groups were more commonly diagnosed in the control arm, but after 9 yr the rates in the screening arm caught up, other than those for the low-risk group. PCa mortality also caught up after 9 yr.  Conclusions:   Nine years after the termination of PSA testing, the incidence of potentially lethal cancers equals that of nonscreened men. Considering the high PCa mortality rate in men >80 yr of age, a general age of 70 yr to discontinue screening might be too low. Instead, a flexible age to discontinue based on individual risk stratification should be recommended.""","""['Anna Grenabo Bergdahl', 'Erik Holmberg', 'Sue Moss', 'Jonas Hugosson']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Corrigendum to ""Incidence of Prostate Cancer After Termination of Screening in a Population-based Randomised Screening Trial"" Eur Urol 2013;64:703-9.', 'Prostate-specific antigen-based screening for prostate cancer: the irony of it all.', 'Outcome following active surveillance of men with screen-detected prostate cancer.

Despite the enormous efforts made for differential expression detection and biomarker discovery, few methods have been designed to model the gene expression level to tumor stage during malignancy progression. Such models could help us understand the dynamics and simplify or reveal the complexity of tumor progression.  Methods:   We have modeled an on-off state of gene activation per sample then per stage to select gene expression profiles associated to tumor progression. The selection is guided by statistical significance of profiles based on random permutated datasets.  Results:   We show that our method identifies expected profiles corresponding to oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes in a prostate tumor progression dataset. Comparisons with other methods support our findings and indicate that a considerable proportion of significant profiles is not found by other statistical tests commonly used to detect differential expression between tumor stages nor found by other tailored methods.

These complexes bind to two distinct receptors, namely, the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) and cell surface glucose-regulated protein [Mr ∼ 78000 (GRP78)]. The latter is a very high affinity receptor (Kd = 50-100 pM) whose ligation triggers pro-proliferative and anti-apoptotic signaling cascades. Despite its four binding sites, Scatchard analysis of binding of α2M* to cells does not yield a cooperative plot. We, therefore, hypothesize that a monomeric cloned and expressed α2M receptor binding domain (RBD) should trigger comparable signaling events. Indeed, RBD or its K1370A mutant that binds to GRP78 but cannot bind to LRP regulates DNA and protein synthesis by human prostate cancer cells in a manner comparable to that of α2M*. Akt and mTORC1 activation and signaling are also comparably upregulated by α2M*, RBD, or mutant K1370A. Antibodies directed against the carboxyl-terminal domain of GRP78 are antagonists that block α2M*-mediated effects on pro-proliferative and anti-apoptotic signaling cascades and protein and DNA synthesis. The effects of RBD and its mutant were similarly blocked by these antibodies. Finally, proteolysis of α2M at pH values from 5.7 to 7.0 causes production of free RBD and RBD-containing fragments. Thus, while α2M* ligates only one GRP78 receptor molecule per α2M*, it may potentially serve as a reservoir for release of up to four binding fragments per molecule.""","""['Uma Kant Misra', 'Sturgis Payne', 'Salvatore Vincent Pizzo']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Biochemistry""","""['Inhibition of NF-kappaB1 and NF-kappaB2 activation in prostate cancer cells treated with antibody against the carboxyl terminal domain of GRP78: effect of p53 upregulation.', 'Receptor-recognized α₂-macroglobulin binds to cell surface-associated GRP78 and activates mTORC1 and mTORC2 signaling in prostate cancer cells.', 'A novel receptor function for the heat shock protein Grp78: silencing of Grp78 gene expression attenuates alpha2M*-induced signalling.', 'GRP78 signaling hub a receptor for targeted tumor therapy.', 'Structural and functional insight into pan-endopeptidase inhibition by α2-macroglobulins.', 'Autophagy, molecular chaperones, and unfolded protein response as promoters of tumor recurrence.', 'Activated Alpha 2-Macroglobulin Is a Novel Mediator of Mesangial Cell Profibrotic Signaling in Diabetic Kidney Disease.', 'Identification of differentially expressed genes and biological pathways in para-carcinoma tissues of HCC with different metastatic potentials.', 'Ovostatin 2 knockdown significantly inhibits the growth, migration, and tumorigenicity of cutaneous malignant melanoma cells.', 'Effects of a systemic enzyme therapy in healthy active adults after exhaustive eccentric exercise: a randomised, two-stage, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial.']"""

HLA-A2-restricted CTL epitopes were identified using the following four-step procedure: (1) a computer program generated predicted epitopes from the amino acid sequence of human hepsin; (2) an HLA-A2-binding assay detected the affinity of the predicted epitopes to the HLA-A2 molecule; (3) the primary T cell response against the predicted epitopes was stimulated in vitro; and (4) the induced CTLs towards different types of hepsin- or HLA-A2-expressing prostate cancer cells were detected. Five candidate peptides were identified. The effectors that were induced by human hepsin epitopes containing residues 229 to 237 (Hpn229; GLQLGVQAV), 268 to 276 (Hpn268; PLTEYIQPV) and 191 to 199 (Hpn199; SLLSGDWVL) effectively lysed LNCaP prostate cancer cells that were hepsin-positive and HLA-A2 matched.

Algorithms to locate translocations may use next-generation sequencing (NGS) platform data. However, paired-end strategies do not accurately predict precise translocation breakpoints, and ""split-read"" methods may lose sensitivity if a translocation boundary is not captured by many sequenced reads. To address these challenges, we have developed ""Bellerophon"", a method that uses discordant read pairs to identify potential translocations, and subsequently uses ""soft-clipped"" reads to predict the location of the precise breakpoints. Furthermore, for each chimeric breakpoint, our method attempts to classify it as a participant in an unbalanced translocation, balanced translocation, or interchromosomal insertion.  Results:   We compared Bellerophon to four previously published algorithms for detecting structural variation (SV). Using two simulated datasets and two prostate cancer datasets, Bellerophon had overall better performance than the other methods. Furthermore, our method accurately predicted the presence of the interchromosomal insertions placed in our simulated dataset, which is an ability that the other SV prediction programs lack.  Conclusions:   The combined use of paired reads and soft-clipped reads allows Bellerophon to detect interchromosomal breakpoints with high sensitivity, while also mitigating losses in specificity. This trend is seen across all datasets examined. Because it does not perform assembly on soft-clipped subreads, Bellerophon may be limited in experiments where sequence read lengths are short.

Based on the observation that genes causing the same or similar phenotypes tend to correlate with each other in the protein-protein interaction network, a lot of network-based approaches were proposed based on different underlying models. A recent comparative study showed that diffusion-based methods achieve the state-of-the-art predictive performance.  Results:   In this paper, a new diffusion-based method was proposed to prioritize candidate disease genes. Diffusion profile of a disease was defined as the stationary distribution of candidate genes given a random walk with restart where similarities between phenotypes are incorporated. Then, candidate disease genes are prioritized by comparing their diffusion profiles with that of the disease. Finally, the effectiveness of our method was demonstrated through the leave-one-out cross-validation against control genes from artificial linkage intervals and randomly chosen genes. Comparative study showed that our method achieves improved performance compared to some classical diffusion-based methods.

To interpret high-throughout transcriptome profiling data, functional enrichment analysis is critical. However, existing functional analysis methods can only account for differential expression, leaving differential splicing out altogether.  Results:   In this work, we present a novel approach to derive biological insight by integrating differential expression and splicing from RNA-Seq data with functional gene set analysis. This approach designated SeqGSEA, uses count data modelling with negative binomial distributions to first score differential expression and splicing in each gene, respectively, followed by two strategies to combine the two scores for integrated gene set enrichment analysis. Method comparison results and biological insight analysis on an artificial data set and three real RNA-Seq data sets indicate that our approach outperforms alternative analysis pipelines and can detect biological meaningful gene sets with high confidence, and that it has the ability to determine if transcription or splicing is their predominant regulatory mechanism.

Inhibitors of FASN, such as orlistat, reportedly show antitumor effects against cancers that over-express FASN, making FASN a promising therapeutic target. However, large variations in FASN expression levels in individual tumors have been observed, and methods to predict FASN-targeted therapy outcome before treatment are required to avoid unnecessary treatment. In addition, how FASN inhibition affects tumor progression remains unclear. Here, we showed the method to predict FASN-targeted therapy outcome using radiolabeled acetate uptake and presented mechanisms of FASN inhibition with human prostate cancer cell lines, to provide the treatment strategy of FASN-targeted therapy. We revealed that tumor uptake of radiolabeled acetate reflected the FASN expression levels and sensitivity to FASN-targeted therapy with orlistat in vitro and in vivo. FASN-targeted therapy was noticeably effective against tumors with high FASN expression, which was indicated by high acetate uptake. To examine mechanisms, we established FASN knockdown prostate cancer cells by transduction of short-hairpin RNA against FASN and investigated the characteristics by analyses on morphology and cell behavior and microarray-based gene expression profiling. FASN inhibition not only suppressed cell proliferation but prevented pseudopodia formation and suppressed cell adhesion, migration, and invasion. FASN inhibition also suppressed genes involved in production of intracellular second messenger arachidonic acid and androgen hormones, both of which promote tumor progression. Collectively, our data demonstrated that uptake of radiolabeled acetate is a useful predictor of FASN-targeted therapy outcome. This suggests that [1-(11)C]acetate positron emission tomography (PET) could be a powerful tool to accomplish personalized FASN-targeted therapy by non-invasive visualization of tumor acetate uptake and selection of responsive tumors.

Viral integration sites were also detected in expressed transcripts using a novel approach. The detection capacity of RNA-Seq was compared to available clinical laboratory data. Human papillomavirus (HPV) transcripts were detected using RNA-Seq analysis in head-and-neck squamous cell carcinoma, uterine endometrioid carcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma of the lung. Detection of HPV by RNA-Seq correlated with detection by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry in squamous cell carcinoma tumors of the head and neck. Hepatitis B virus and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) were detected using RNA-Seq in hepatocellular carcinoma and gastric carcinoma tumors, respectively. Integration sites of viral genes and oncogenes were detected in cancers harboring HPV or hepatitis B virus but not in EBV-positive gastric carcinoma. Integration sites of expressed viral transcripts frequently involved known coding areas of the host genome. No DNA virus transcripts were detected in acute myeloid leukemia, cutaneous melanoma, low- and high-grade gliomas of the brain, and adenocarcinomas of the breast, colon and rectum, lung, prostate, ovary, kidney, and thyroid.

PC, which exhibits a slow growth rate and multiple potential target epitopes, is an ideal candidate for immunotherapy. GVAX for prostate cancer is a cellular immunotherapy, composed of PC-3 cells (CG1940) and LNCaP cells (CG8711). Each of the components is a prostate adenocarcinoma cell line that has been genetically modified to secrete granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Hypothesizing that GVAX for prostate cancer could be effective in a neoadjuvant setting in patients with locally advanced disease, we initiated a phase II trial of neoadjuvant docetaxel and GVAX. For the trial, the clinical effects of GVAX were assessed in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy (RP).  Methods:   Patients received docetaxel administered at a dose of 75 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks for 4 cycles. GVAX was administered 2-3 days after chemotherapy preoperatively for four courses of immunotherapy. The first dose of GVAX was a prime immunotherapy of 5×10(8) cells. The subsequent boost immunotherapies consisted of 3×10(8) cells. After RP, patients received an additional six courses of immunotherapy. Pathologic complete response, toxicity, and clinical response were assessed. The primary endpoint of the trial was a pathologic state of pT0, which is defined as no evidence of cancer in the prostate.  Results:   Six patients completed neoadjuvant docetaxel and GVAX therapy. No serious drug-related adverse events were observed. Median change in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) following neoadjuvant therapy was 1.47 ng/ml. One patient did not undergo RP due to the discovery of positive lymph nodes during exploration. Of the five patients completing RP, four had a downstaging of their Gleason score. Undetectable PSA was achieved in three patients at 2 months after RP and in two patients at 3 years after RP.  Conclusions:   Neoadjuvant docetaxel/GVAX is safe and well tolerated in patients with high-risk locally advanced PC. No evidence of increased intraoperative hemorrhage or increased length of hospital stay postoperatively was noted.

An underinvestigated component of the chaperone system is the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR)-containing cochaperone, which coordinates Hsp70/Hsp90 involvement on client proteins as well as having diverse individual actions. A potentially important cochaperone in prostate cancer (PCa) is small glutamine-rich TPR-containing protein alpha (SGTA), which interacts with the androgen receptor (AR) and other critical cancer-related client proteins. In this study, the authors used small interfering RNA coupled with genome-wide expression profiling to investigate the biological significance of SGTA in PCa and its influence on AR signaling. Knockdown of SGTA for 72 hr in PCa C4-2B cells significantly altered expression of >1,900 genes (58% decreased) and reduced cell proliferation (p < 0.05). The regulation of 35% of 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) target genes was affected by SGTA knockdown, with gene-specific effects on basal or DHT-induced expression or both. Pathway analysis revealed a role for SGTA in p53, generic PCa and phosphoinositol kinase (PI3K) signaling pathways; the latter evident by a reduction in PI3K subunit p100β levels and decreased phosphorylated Akt. Immunohistochemical analysis of 64 primary advanced PCa samples showed a significant increase in the AR:SGTA ratio in cancerous lesions compared to patient-matched benign prostatic hyperplasia tissue (p < 0.02).

Here, we describe a novel spheroid culture system that supports long-term growth of LuCaP cells in vitro.  Methods:   Xenografts were minced and digested with collagenase. Tissue dissociation was terminated while the majority of cells remained as clusters rather than single cells. The cell clusters were suspended in StemPro medium supplemented with R1881 and Y-27632, a Rho kinase inhibitor, and placed in ultralow attachment dishes for spheroid culture. Serial passage was achieved by partial digestion to small clusters with trypsin/EDTA in the presence of Y-27632. Cell viability, growth and phenotype were monitored with LIVE/DEAD®, MTS, qRT-PCR, and immunocytochemical assays.  Results:   Cells from six LuCaP xenografts formed proliferating spheroids that were serially passaged a minimum of three times and cryopreserved. Two of the cell lines, LuCaP 136 and LuCaP 147, were further passaged and characterized. Both expressed biomarkers characteristic of the xenografts of origin, were determined to be of independent origin by STR fingerprinting, and were free of mycoplasma.

Methods/patients:   Data have been provided by two population-based cancer registries, Girona and Tarragona, and the Catalan mortality registry. Cancer incidence in Catalonia has been estimated through modeling methods using data from these health structures.  Results:   During 2003-2007, there were 20,042 cancer cases and 9,842 deaths per year among men and 13,673 new cancer cases and 5,882 deaths among women. The most frequent incident cancers among men were prostate (N = 4,258), lung (N = 3,021), colorectal (N = 3,007) and bladder (N = 2,238), whereas among women they were breast (N = 3,907), colorectal (N = 2,088), corpus uteri (N = 734) and lung (N = 527). During 1993-2007, age-standardized incidence rates (ASIRs) rose 1.2 % per year among men [prostate (6.3 %), testis (5.7 %), kidney (2.9 %), liver (2.2 %) and colorectal (2.1 %)]. ASIRs decreased for stomach (-2.9 %), oral cavity and pharynx (-2.8 %), larynx (-2.7 %) and esophagus (-2 %). Among women, ASIRs only rose for lung (5.2 %), kidney (3.1 %), oral cavity and pharynx (2.6 %) and thyroid (1.6 %). ASIRs decreased for corpus uteri (-2.3 %), stomach (-1.7 %) and ovary (-1.6 %). Cancer mortality decreased -1.3 % per year among men and -2.1 % among women during the same period.  Conclusion:   Among men, the decrease of incidence/mortality of tobacco-related tumors was related to a reduction of smoking prevalence.

PCSCs were isolated from the human prostate cancer cell line LNcap by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS). EZH2 expression was compared between PCSCs and non-PCSCs. The association between EZH2 function and PCSC growth was investigated using siRNA-mediated knock-down of EZH2. Cell growth was investigated by MTT, cell cycle and apoptosis of PCSCs were explored by flow cytometric analysis. Finally, the upstream pathway miRNA level was determined via a luciferase reporter assay, and the downstream pathway cycle regulators were examined via reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. The results showed that LNcap cell line comprised a greater proportion of CD44+/CD133+ cells by comparison to the PC-3 cell line. EZH2 was up-regulated in PCSCs compared with non-PCSCs. Silence of EZH2 inhibited cell growth and the cell cycle and promoted the progression of apoptosis.

The aim of this study was to assess the biodistribution and pharmacokinetic characteristics of a novel choline-bound GNP (choline-GNP) stabilized with polyethelenimine (PEI).  Methods:   Choline bound to 27 nm diameter GNPs was characterized using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Toxicity of choline-GNPs was examined on DU-145 prostate cancer cells using an MTT assay. Using balb/c mice bearing flank DU-145 prostate tumors, choline-GNPs bio-distribution was measured using inductively coupled mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS). Blood, heart, lung, liver, spleen, brain, kidney and tumor gold content were examined at multiple time points over a 24-hour period after tail vein injection.  Results:   An MTT assay using DU-145 prostate cancer cells yielded a 95% cell viability 72 hours after choline-GNP administration. The tumor GNP area under the concentration-time curve during the first 4 hours (AUC0-4) was 2.2 µg/ml h, representing 13% of the circulating blood GNP concentration over the same time period. The maximum intra-tumor GNP concentration observed was 1.4% of the injected dose per gram of tumor tissue (%ID/g) one hour post injection.  Conclusions:   GNPs functionalized with choline demonstrates a viable future nanoparticle platform with increased intra-tumor uptake as compared to unconjugated GNPs. Decreased intra-hepatic accumulation appears to be the reason for the improved systemic bioavailability. The next logical translational investigation will incorporate external beam radiation with the observed maximum intra-tumor uptake.""","""['Rene Razzak', 'Joe Zhou', 'XiaoHong Yang', 'Nadim Pervez', 'Eric Lr Bédard', 'Ronald B Moore', 'Andrew Shaw', 'John Amanie', 'Wilson H Roa']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Clin Invest Med""","""['Enhanced intracellular translocation and biodistribution of gold nanoparticles functionalized with a cell-penetrating peptide (VG-21) from vesicular stomatitis virus.', 'Evaluation of cytotoxicity of a purified venom protein from Naja kaouthia (NKCT1) using gold nanoparticles for targeted delivery to cancer cell.', 'Prostate Cancer Targeted X-Ray Fluorescence Imaging via Gold Nanoparticles Functionalized With Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA).', 'Physical basis and biological mechanisms of gold nanoparticle radiosensitization.', 'Gold nanoparticle-conjugated nanomedicine: design, construction, and structure-efficacy relationship studies.', 'Meta-Analysis of Nanoparticle Delivery to Tumors Using a Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic Modeling and Simulation Approach.', 'Modeling gold nanoparticle-eluting spacer degradation during brachytherapy application with in situ dose painting.', 'Targeted polyethylene glycol gold nanoparticles for the treatment of pancreatic cancer: from synthesis to proof-of-concept in vitro studies.', 'Gold nanoparticles and their alternatives for radiation therapy enhancement.']"""

However formalin fixation results in chemical modification of RNA and increased RNA degradation. This can affect RNA yield and quality. A critical step when analysing gene expression is the conversion of RNA to complementary DNA (cDNA) using a reverse transcriptase (RT) enzyme. FFPE derived RNA may affect the performance and efficiency of the RT enzyme and cDNA synthesis. We directly compared three commonly used FFPE RNA isolation methods and measured RNA yield, purity and integrity. We also assessed the effectiveness of three commercially available Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus (M-MLV) RTs on cDNA synthesis and gene expression sensitivity when using FFPE RNA as a template. Our results show that gene detection sensitivity is dependent on the isolation method, RT and length of the PCR amplicon (<200bp) when using FFPE RNA. The use of an M-MLV RT enzyme with reduced RNaseH activity gave significantly increased qRT-PCR sensitivity when using FFPE RNA derived from prostate tissue. The choice of RT can also affect perceived changes in target gene expression and thus the same RT should be used when attempting to reproduce results from different studies. This study highlights the need to optimise and evaluate RNA isolation methods and RTs when using FFPE RNA as a template in order to maximise a successful outcome in PCR applications.""","""['Rachel M Hagen', 'Anthony Rhodes', 'Jon Oxley', 'Michael R Ladomery']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Exp Mol Pathol""","""['Real-time quantitative RT-PCR shows variable, assay-dependent sensitivity to formalin fixation: implications for direct comparison of transcript levels in paraffin-embedded tissues.', 'Higher random oligo concentration improves reverse transcription yield of cDNA from bioptic tissues and quantitative RT-PCR reliability.', 'Gene expression analysis of normal and colorectal cancer tissue samples from fresh frozen and matched formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens after manual and automated RNA isolation.', 'MicroRNA expression in formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue using real time quantitative PCR: the strengths and pitfalls.', 'Murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase: structural comparison with HIV-1 reverse transcriptase.', 'A comprehensive map of single-base polymorphisms in the hypervariable LPA kringle IV type 2 copy number variation region.', 'Intrinsic BET inhibitor resistance in SPOP-mutated prostate cancer is mediated by BET protein stabilization and AKT-mTORC1 activation.', 'The nitrobenzoxadiazole derivative MC3181 blocks melanoma invasion and metastasis.']"""

However, published PCa diagnostic markers share little overlap and are poorly validated using independent data. Therefore, we here developed an integrative proteomics and interaction network-based classifier by combining the differential protein expression with topological features of human protein interaction networks to enhance the ability of PCa diagnosis.  Methods and results:   By two-dimensional fluorescence difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) coupled with MS using PCa and adjacent benign tissues of prostate, a total of 60 proteins with the differential expression in PCa tissues were identified as the candidate markers. Then, their networks were analyzed by GeneGO Meta-Core software and three hub proteins (PTEN, SFPQ and HDAC1) were chosen. After that, a PCa diagnostic classifier was constructed by support vector machine (SVM) modeling based on the microarray gene expression data of the genes which encode the hub proteins mentioned above. Validations of diagnostic performance showed that this classifier had high predictive accuracy (85.96∼90.18%) and area under ROC curve (approximating 1.0). Furthermore, the clinical significance of PTEN, SFPQ and HDAC1 proteins in PCa was validated by both ELISA and immunohistochemistry analyses. More interestingly, PTEN protein was identified as an independent prognostic marker for biochemical recurrence-free survival in PCa patients according to the multivariate analysis by Cox Regression.  Conclusions:   Our data indicated that the integrative proteomics and interaction network-based classifier which combines the differential protein expression and topological features of human protein interaction network may be a powerful tool for the diagnosis of PCa.

Inflammation mediators related to radiation proctitis are partially elucidated, and neovascularization is thought to play a key role. Objectives. To investigate the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and CD31 as angiogenetic markers in postradiation rectal tissue. Methods. Rectal mucosa biopsies from 11 patients who underwent irradiation for prostate cancer were examined immunohistochemically for the expression of VEGF and CD31 at three time settings-before, at the completion of, and 6 months after radiotherapy. VEGF expressing vascular endothelial cells and CD31 expressing microvessels were counted separately in 10 high-power fields (HPFs). VEGF vascular index (VEGF-VI) and microvascular density (MVD) were calculated as the mean number of VEGF positive cells per vessel or the mean number of vessels per HPF, respectively. Histological features were also evaluated. Results. VEGF-VI was significantly higher at the completion of radiotherapy (0.17 ± 0.15 versus 0.41 ± 0.24, P = 0.001) declining 6 months after. MVD increased significantly only 6 months after radiotherapy (7.3 ± 3.2 versus 10.5 ± 3.1, P < 0.005).

We aimed to evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic potential of metabolites in prostate cancer (PCa) tissue after radical prostatectomy. In matched malignant and nonmalignant prostatectomy samples from 95 PCa patients, aminoadipic acid, cerebronic acid, gluconic acid, glycerophosphoethanolamine, 2-hydroxybehenic acid, isopentenyl pyrophosphate, maltotriose, 7-methylguanine and tricosanoic acid were determined within a global metabolite profiling study using gas chromatography/liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. The data were related to clinicopathological variables like prostate volume, tumor stage, Gleason score, preoperative prostate-specific antigen and disease recurrence in the follow-up. All nine metabolites showed higher concentrations in malignant than in nonmalignant samples except for gluconic acid and maltotriose, which had lower levels in tumors. Receiver -operating characteristics analysis demonstrated a significant discrimination for all metabolites between malignant and nonmalignant tissue with a maximal area under the curve of 0.86 for tricosanoic acid, whereas no correlation was observed between the metabolite levels and the Gleason score or tumor stage except for gluconic acid. Univariate Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier analyses showed that levels of aminoadipic acid, gluconic acid and maltotriose were associated with the biochemical tumor recurrence (prostate-specific antigen > 0.2 ng/mL). In multivariate Cox regression analyses, aminoadipic acid together with tumor stage and Gleason score remained in a model as independent marker for prediction of biochemical recurrence.

A large analysis of the SEER database estimates that approximately 16 % of new cancers reported to their registry represent a second or higher order malignancy. The purpose of this study is to estimate the number of MPM diagnoses and to define differences in synchronous and metachronous cancers in the Veterans Affairs (VA) population.  Methods:   The primary objective of this study was to determine the proportion of second or higher order cancers diagnosed at the Minneapolis VA Medical Center from 1 January 2005 to 31 December 2009. The secondary objectives were to analyze and compare correlative demographic, exposure, clinical, and tumor data among those with synchronous and metachronous malignancies. We included any patient with a diagnosis of a malignant cancer during the study period.  Result:   A total of 4,449 patients were diagnosed with malignancies during the study period. Of these, 506 patients (11.4 % of cancer diagnoses) had a diagnosis of a second or higher order malignancy. Of the 506 patients, 124 (24.3 %) had synchronous malignancies and 383 (75.5 %) had metachronous malignancies. The most common malignancy pairing was prostate cancer with bladder/ureter cancer (12 %) of MPM diagnoses. Differences between patients with synchronous and metachronous second occurrences were identified.  Conclusion:   Multiple primary malignancies are a growing area of interest in cancer survivorship. At our institution, approximately 1 in 9 new cancer diagnoses during the 5-year study period represented second-order malignancies.

In this study, we examined the therapeutic efficacy of a combined inhibition of the AR and the regulatory subunit type Iα (RIα) of protein kinase A with second generation antisense oligonucleotides (ODNs) in androgen-sensitive LNCaP and castration-resistant LNCaPabl tumors in vivo. We found that targeting the AR alone inhibited LNCaP, as well as LNCaPabl tumors. Combined inhibition resulted in an improved response over single targeting and even a complete tumor remission in LNCaPabl. Western blot analysis revealed that both ODNs were effective in reducing their target proteins when administered alone or in combination. In addition, treatment with the ODNs was associated with an induction of apoptosis. Our data suggest that dual targeting of the AR and PKARIα is more effective in inhibiting LNCaP and LNCaPabl tumor growth than single treatment and may give a treatment benefit, especially in castration-resistant prostate cancers.""","""['Iris E Eder', 'Martina Egger', 'Hannes Neuwirt', 'Christof Seifarth', 'Danilo Maddalo', 'Andreas Desiniotis', 'Georg Schäfer', 'Martin Puhr', 'Jasmin Bektic', 'Andrew C B Cato', 'Helmut Klocker']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Int J Mol Sci""","""['Enhanced antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects on prostate cancer cells by simultaneously inhibiting androgen receptor and cAMP-dependent protein kinase A.', 'PKA knockdown enhances cell killing in response to radiation and androgen deprivation.', 'Methylselenocysteine preventing castration-resistant progression of prostate cancer.', 'Dual targeting of androgen receptor and mTORC1 by salinomycin in prostate cancer.', 'Androgens as therapy for androgen receptor-positive castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Targeting Protein Kinases and Epigenetic Control as Combinatorial Therapy Options for Advanced Prostate Cancer Treatment.', 'Phosphorylation of HSP90 by protein kinase A is essential for the nuclear translocation of androgen receptor.', 'Development of Bag-1L as a therapeutic target in androgen receptor-dependent prostate cancer.', 'Sustained proliferation in cancer: Mechanisms and novel therapeutic targets.']"""

We identified patients in our referral institution database (1997-2009) with entry prostate-specific antigen <10 ng/mL, stage ≤cT2, Gleason sum ≤6, ≤3 cores positive for cancer, <50% of single core involved, and age ≤75 years (N = 272).

In some cases, circulating miRNAs have been evaluated as markers of the efficacy of anticancer treatment but it is not yet clear if miRNAs are actively released by tumor cells or derive from dead tumor cells.  Results:   We showed that a set of prostate cancer secretory miRNAs (PCS-miRNAs) were spontaneously released in the growth medium by DU-145 prostate cancer cells and that the release was greater after treatment with the cytotoxic drug fludarabine. We also found that the miRNAs were associated with exosomes, implying an active mechanism of miRNA release. It should be noted that in fludarabine treated cells the release of miR-485-3p, as well as its association with exosomes, was reduced suggesting that miR-485-3p was retained by surviving cells. Monitoring the intracellular level of miR-485-3p in these cells, we found that miR-485-3p was stably up regulated for several days after treatment. As a possible mechanism we suggest that fludarabine selected cells that harbor high levels of miR-485-3p, which in turn regulates the transcriptional repressor nuclear factor-Y triggering the transcription of topoisomerase IIα, multidrug resistance gene 1 and cyclin B2 pro-survival genes.  Conclusions:   Cytotoxic treatment of DU-145 cells enhanced the release of PCS-miRNAs with the exception of miR-485-3p which was retained by surviving cells. We speculate that the retention of miR-485-3p was a side effect of fludarabine treatment in that the high intracellular level of miR-485-3p plays a role in the sensitivity to fludarabine.""","""['Serena Lucotti', 'Giuseppe Rainaldi', 'Monica Evangelista', 'Milena Rizzo']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Mol Cancer""","""['miR-34a is an intracellular and exosomal predictive biomarker for response to docetaxel with clinical relevance to prostate cancer progression.', 'miR-199a-3p targets stemness-related and mitogenic signaling pathways to suppress the expansion and tumorigenic capabilities of prostate cancer stem cells.', 'Functional Passenger-Strand miRNAs in Exosomes Derived from Human Colon Cancer Cells and Their Heterogeneous Paracrine Effects.', 'Therapeutic potential of an anti-diabetic drug, metformin: alteration of miRNA expression in prostate cancer cells.', 'Regulation of the MIR155 host gene in physiological and pathological processes.', 'Comprehensive characterization of RNA cargo of extracellular vesicles in breast cancer patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy.', 'Diagnostic and prognostic significance of extracellular vesicles in prostate cancer drug resistance: A systematic review of the literature.', 'Extracellular Vesicles in Advanced Prostate Cancer: Tools to Predict and Thwart Therapeutic Resistance.', 'Identification of Ovine Serum miRNAs Following Bacterial Lipopolysaccharide Challenge.', 'Long-chain non-coding RNA MALAT1 regulates paclitaxel resistance of breast cancer cells by targeting miR-485-3p.']"""

Methods:   Four PSMA inhibitors derived from the glutamate-urea-glutamate or glutamate-urea-lysine pharmacophores conjugated to CIM or TIM chelators were radiolabeled with (99m)Tc and evaluated in vitro and in vivo.  Results:   High-affinity, saturable binding to PSMA on LNCaP cells was observed with Kd values of 0.64 ± 0.46 nM for (99m)Tc-MIP-1427, 1.07 ± 0.89 nM for (99m)Tc-MIP-1404, 1.75 ± 0.32 nM for (99m)Tc-MIP-1428, and 4.35 ± 0.35 nM for (99m)Tc-MIP-1405. (99m)Tc-labeled PSMA inhibitors did not bind human prostate cancer PC3 cells, which lack PSMA, demonstrating specificity, and binding was abolished with 2-(phosphonomethyl)pentanedioic acid (PMPA), a structurally unrelated PSMA inhibitor. (99m)Tc-labeled PSMA inhibitors were shown to internalize at 37 °C. Uptake in LNCaP xenografts ranged from 9.3% to 12.4% injected dose per gram at 1 h after injection and from 7.2% to 11.0% at 4 h, with tumor-to-blood ratios ranging from 29:1 to 550:1 and tumor-to-skeletal muscle ratios ranging from 31:1 to 157:1 at 4 h.

The target population was inhabitants of communities located on bedrock younger than 3.3 million years, utilizing hot-water supply generated from geothermal wells since 1972. The two reference populations were inhabitants of communities without this hot-water supply located on areas with less volcanic/geothermal activity, and bedrock older than 3.3 million years.

HR in the geothermal hot-water supply areas for all cancer was 1.15 (95% CI 1.05-1.25) as compared with nongeothermal areas. The HR for breast cancer was 1.40 (1.12-1.75), prostate cancer 1.61 (1.29-2.00), kidney cancer 1.64 (1.11-2.41), lymphatic and haematopoietic tissue cancers 1.45 (1.08-1.95), and for basal cell carcinoma (BCC) of the skin 1.46 (1.16-1.82).

Methods:   A previously developed survey was used to evaluate understanding of terms related to urinary, bowel, and sexual function. The survey was administered by trained evaluators at 2 safety net clinics that provide care for low-income, predominantly African American patients. Comprehension was assessed using semiqualitative methods coded by 2 independent investigators. Literacy and numeracy were also evaluated.  Results:   Among 109 patients who completed the study, only 5% understood the function of the prostate, and 15%, 29%, and 32% understood the terms ""incontinence,"" ""urinary function,"" and ""bowel habits,"" respectively. Lower levels of comprehension were observed for compound words, such as ""vaginal intercourse"" (58%), versus single words such as ""intercourse"" (95%), validating previous work. Median school level was 13 years, yet median literacy level was only ninth grade, and reading level was significantly correlated with comprehension. Only 30% of patients correctly calculated both a fraction and a percent.  Conclusions:   Lack of comprehension of prostate health terminology is pronounced in this patient population and may be widespread.

AC modulates the cellular balance between ceramide, sphingosine and sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P). These bioactive sphingolipids have diverse, powerful and often oppositional impacts on cell signaling, including the activation status of the oncogenic kinase Akt. Our studies show that AC expression correlates with phosphorylation of Akt in human prostate tumors, and elevation of phosphorylated Akt in tumor versus patient-matched benign tissue is contingent upon AC elevation. Investigation of the mechanism for AC-induced Akt activation revealed that AC activates Akt through sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1)-derived generation of S1P. This signaling pathway proceeds through S1P receptor 2 (S1PR2)-dependent stimulation of PI3K. Functionally, AC-overexpressing cells are insensitive to cytotoxic chemotherapy, however, these cells are more susceptible to targeted inhibition of Akt. AC-overexpressing cells proliferate more rapidly than control cells and form more colonies in soft agar; however, these effects are profoundly sensitive to Akt inhibition, demonstrating increased dependence on Akt signaling for the oncogenic phenotypes of AC-overexpressing cells.

In this article a new case of thyroid-like follicular carcinoma of kidney is described which was incidentally detected at autopsy. The 58-year-old patient died of complications of acute myeloid leukemia after chemotherapy and also had prostatic adenocarcinoma. The renal tumor in the left kidney had a diameter of 3 cm and showed a grey-brown cut surface. Histologically, the tumor presented with a typical thyroid-like microfollicular and macrofollicular structure filled with eosinophilic, colloid-like material with calcification.

Background:   Recent reports indicate an increase in the incidence of groin hernia repair after radical prostatectomy. Inadequate knowledge of the incidence of groin hernia in the general population makes this information hard to interpret.  Methods:   Information was retrieved from the Prostate Cancer Database (PCBaSe) and Swedish Hernia Register for events between 1998 and 2010. The incidence of groin hernia surgery was calculated for a group of men treated with radical prostatectomy (open and minimally invasive) and for a group treated with radiation therapy, and these were compared with the incidence in a control cohort of men matched for age and county of residence. Multivariate analysis was used to assess the hazard ratio (HR) of groin hernia repair according to age, tumor risk category, and Charlson Comorbidity Index.  Results:   A total of 28,608 cases and 105,422 controls were included in the study. Men treated with radical prostatectomy and radiation therapy had a significantly higher incidence of groin hernia repair than the control cohort: HR: 3.95 (95% confidence interval: 3.70-4.21) for retropubic prostatectomy, HR: 3.37 (95% confidence interval: 2.95-3.87) for minimally invasive prostatectomy, and HR: 1.84 (95% confidence interval: 1.66-2.04) for radiation therapy.  Conclusions:   An almost 4-fold increase in groin hernia repair was observed after radical prostatectomy compared with controls, and men who received radiation therapy had an almost 2-fold increase in incidence. As well as postoperative changes in the abdominal wall, increased vigilance for groin hernia seems to be important for the increased incidence of groin hernia repair seen after radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy for prostate cancer.""","""['Hanna Nilsson', 'Johan Stranne', 'Pär Stattin', 'Pär Nordin']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Ann Surg""","""['Patent processus vaginalis in adults who underwent robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy: predictive signs of postoperative inguinal hernia in the internal inguinal floor.', 'Postoperative inguinal hernia after radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer.', 'Comprehensive preoperative evaluation and repair of inguinal hernias at the time of open radical retropubic prostatectomy decreases risk of developing post-prostatectomy hernia.', 'High incidence of inguinal hernia after radical retropubic prostatectomy.', 'Outcomes of Minimally Invasive Inguinal Hernia Repair at the Time of Robotic Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Sex-specific genetic variants associated with adult-onset inguinal hernia in a Taiwanese population.', 'Outcome of inguinal hernia repair after previous radical prostatectomy: a registry-based analysis with 12,465 patients.', 'Acute, Subchronic, and Chronic Complications of Radical Prostatectomy Versus Radiotherapy With Hormone Therapy in Older Adults With High-Risk Prostate Adenocarcinoma.', 'Concurrent Inguinal Hernia Repair During Robot-Assisted Transperitoneal Radical Prostatectomy: Single Center Experience.', 'Consensus on international guidelines for management of groin hernias.']"""

However the influence of physical activity on the immunological level remains uncertain. Even prostate cancer patients undergoing palliative treatment often have a relatively long life span compared to other cancer entities. To optimize exercise programs and their outcomes it is essential to investigate the underlying mechanisms. Further, it is important to discriminate between different exercise protocols and therapy regimes.  Methods/design:   The ProImmun study is a prospective multicenter patient preference randomized controlled trial investigating the influence of a 24 week endurance exercise program in 80-100 prostate cancer patients by comparing patients undergoing Antiandrogen therapy combined with exercise (AE), Antiandrogen therapy without exercise (A), Chemotherapy with exercise(CE) or Chemotherapy without exercise (C). The primary outcome of the study is a change in prostate cancer relevant cytokines and hormones (IL-6, MIF, IGF-1, Testosterone). Secondary endpoints are immune cell ratios, oxidative stress and antioxidative capacity levels, VO2 peak, fatigue and quality of life. Patients of the intervention group exercise five times per week, while two sessions are supervised. During the supervised sessions patients (AE and CE) exercise for 33 minutes on a bicycle ergometer at 70-75% of their VO2 peak. To assess long term effects and sustainability of the intervention two follow-up assessments are arranged 12 and 18 month after the intervention.  Discussion:   The ProImmun study is the first trial which primarily investigates immunological effects of a six month endurance exercise program in prostate cancer patients during palliative care. Separating patients treated with Antiandrogen therapy from those who are additionally treated with Chemotherapy might allow a more specific view on the influence of endurance training interventions and the impact of different therapy protocols on the immune function.

In this paper, we estimate the prospective burden of disease arising from 27 cancer sites diagnosed in 2006, by sex and ethnicity; and determine how its distribution differs from that for incidence rates alone.  Methods:   Using a prospective approach, Markov and cancer disease models were used to estimate DALYs with inputs of population counts, incidence and excess mortality rates, disability weights, and background mortality. DALYs were discounted at 3.5% per year.  Results:   The age standardised Māori:non-Māori incidence rate ratios were 1.00 for males and 1.19 for females, whereas for DALYs they were greater at 1.42 for males and 1.68 for females. The total burden of cancer for 2006 incident cases (i.e. not age standardised) was estimated to be approximately 127,000 DALYs. Breast (27%), lung (14%) and colorectal (13%) cancers for females and lung (16%), colorectal (14%), and prostate (16%) cancers for males were the top contributors. By ethnicity, Māori experienced a substantially higher burden from lung cancer (around 25% for both sexes).  Conclusions:   Due to Māori both having higher rates of cancers with a worse survival (e.g. lung cancer), and tending to have worse survival for each cancer site, ethnic disparities in the age-standardised DALY burden were greater than those for incidence (rate ratios of 1.52 and 1.07 respectively, sexes pooled).""","""['Roy Costilla', 'Martin Tobias', 'Tony Blakely']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Aust N Z J Public Health""","""['Burden of disease due to cancer in England and Wales.', 'Global burden of cancer in 2008: a systematic analysis of disability-adjusted life-years in 12 world regions.', 'Burden of disease due to cancer in a Southern Brazilian state.', 'Global burden of disease in young people aged 10-24 years: a systematic analysis.', 'Global and regional burden of death and disability from peripheral artery disease: 21 world regions, 1990 to 2010.', 'Development of an Australia and New Zealand Lung Cancer Clinical Quality Registry: a protocol paper.', 'Disease-related income and economic productivity loss in New Zealand: A longitudinal analysis of linked individual-level data.', 'Health system costs for individual and comorbid noncommunicable diseases: An analysis of publicly funded health events from New Zealand.', 'Cancer-preventive Properties of an Anthocyanin-enriched Sweet Potato in the APCMIN Mouse Model.', 'Tuberculosis DALY-Gap: Spatial and Quantitative Comparison of Disease Burden Across Urban Slum and Non-slum Census Tracts.']"""

Methods:   Data from 1268 patients undergoing radical prostatectomy without neoadjuvant therapy between 2000 and 2009 at four urological centers in Japan were retrospectively reviewed. Changes in age at radical prostatectomy, prostate-specific antigen level, biopsy Gleason score, clinical T stage, D'Amico risk classification, organ-confined disease and tumor volume in surgical specimens were analyzed over time.

Conversely, Cav-1 expression in the stroma can decline in advanced and metastatic prostate cancer. In a large cohort of 724 prostate cancers, we observed significantly decreased levels of stromal Cav-1 in concordance with increased Gleason score (p = 0.012). Importantly, reduced expression of Cav-1 in the stroma correlated with reduced relapse-free survival (p = 0.009), suggesting a role for stromal Cav-1 in inhibiting advanced disease. Silencing of Cav-1 by shRNA in WPMY-1 prostate fibroblasts resulted in up-regulation of Akt phosphorylation, and significantly altered expression of genes involved in angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis, including a > 2.5-fold increase in TGF-β1 and γ-synuclein (SNCG) gene expression. Moreover, silencing of Cav-1 induced migration of prostate cancer cells when stromal cells were used as attractants. Pharmacological inhibition of Akt caused down-regulation of TGF-β1 and SNCG, suggesting that loss of Cav-1 in the stroma can influence Akt-mediated signalling in the tumour microenvironment. Cav-1-depleted stromal cells exhibited increased levels of intracellular cholesterol, a precursor for androgen biosynthesis, steroidogenic enzymes, and testosterone.

Although patients with metastatic presentation have an ominous outcome, the vast majority of PCs are diagnosed at an early stage. Nonetheless, even among patients with clinically localized disease the outcome may vary considerably. Other than androgen sensitivity, little is known about which other signaling pathways are deranged in aggressive, localized cancers. The elucidation of such pathways may help to develop innovative therapies aimed at specific molecular targets. We report that in a hormone-sensitive PC cell line, LNCaP, Notch3 was activated by hypoxia and sustained cell proliferation and colony formation in soft agar. Hypoxia also modulated cellular cholesterol content and the number and size of lipid rafts, causing a coalescence of small rafts into bigger clusters; under this experimental condition, Notch3 migrated from the non-raft into the raft compartment where it colocalized with the γ-secretase complex. We also looked at human PC biopsies and found that expression of Notch3 positively correlated with Gleason score and with expression of carbonic anhydrase IX, a marker of hypoxia. In conclusion, hypoxia triggers the activation of Notch3, which, in turn, sustains proliferation of PC cells.

The impact of sunshine on racial disparities in prostate cancer incidence and mortality is unknown.  Methods:   Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program database, the authors calculated age-adjusted prostate cancer incidence rates among black and white men aged ≥ 45 years by race and county between 2000 and 2009 (N = 906,381 men). Similarly, county-level prostate cancer mortality rates were calculated from the National Vital Statistics System (N = 288,874). These data were linked with the average monthly solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation index by county and data regarding health, wellness, and demographics. Multivariable regression analysis was used to assess whether increases in the UV index (in deciles) moderated the association between black race and the incidence and mortality of prostate cancer.  Results:   Compared with counties in the lowest UV index decile, prostate cancer incidence rates for white and black men were lower in counties with a higher UV index (all Ps ≤ 0.051). Incidence rates were higher for black men versus white men, but the difference by race was less for counties in the fourth to fifth UV index deciles versus those in the first decile (Ps ≤ 0.02). Mortality rates also were found to decrease with increasing UV index for white men (Ps ≤ 0.003), but increase for black men, and an unexplained increase in racial differences in mortality rates was observed with an increasing UV index.  Conclusions:   Racial disparities in the incidence of prostate cancer were larger in some areas with less sunshine.

Thymoquinone (TQ) is the major bioactive constituent of volatile oil of Nigella sativa and has been shown to exert various pharmacological properties, such as anti-inflammatory, cardiovascular, analgesic, anti-neoplastic, anticancer and chemopreventive. Although several mechanisms have been suggested for the chemopreventive and anticancer activity of TQ, a clear mechanism of action of TQ has not been elucidated. TQ is a known antioxidant at lower concentrations and most of the studies elucidating the mechanism have centered on the antioxidant property. However, recent publications have shown that TQ may act as a prooxidant at higher concentrations. It is well known that plant-derived antioxidants can switch to prooxidants even at low concentrations in the presence of transition metal ions such as copper. It is well established that tissue, cellular and serum copper levels are considerably elevated in various malignancies. Copper is an important metal ion present in the chromatin and is closely associated with DNA bases, particularly guanine. Using human peripheral lymphocytes and comet assay, we first show that TQ is able to cause oxidative cellular DNA breakage. Such a DNA breakage can be inhibited by copper-chelating agents, neocuproine and bathocuproine, and scavengers of reactive oxygen species. Further, it is seen that TQ targets cellular copper in prostate cancer cell lines leading to a prooxidant cell death. We believe that such a prooxidant cytotoxic mechanism better explains the anticancer activity of plant-derived antioxidants.""","""['H Zubair', 'H Y Khan', 'A Sohail', 'S Azim', 'M F Ullah', 'A Ahmad', 'F H Sarkar', 'S M Hadi']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Cell Death Dis""","""['The prooxidant action of dietary antioxidants leading to cellular DNA breakage and anticancer effects: implications for chemotherapeutic action against cancer.', 'Redox cycling of endogenous copper by ferulic acid leads to cellular DNA breakage and consequent cell death: A putative cancer chemotherapy mechanism.', 'Prooxidant DNA breakage induced by caffeic acid in human peripheral lymphocytes: involvement of endogenous copper and a putative mechanism for anticancer properties.', 'Catalytic therapy of cancer by ascorbic acid involves redox cycling of exogenous/endogenous copper ions and generation of reactive oxygen species.', 'A prooxidant mechanism for the anticancer and chemopreventive properties of plant polyphenols.', 'Disulfiram Enhances the Antineoplastic Activity and Sensitivity of Murine Hepatocellular Carcinoma to 5-FU via Redox Management.', 'Advances in research on the relationship between thymoquinone and pancreatic cancer.', 'Cell-penetrating peptide-conjugated copper complexes for redox-mediated anticancer therapy.', 'Thymoquinone Alleviates Cadmium Induced Stress in Germinated Lens culinaris Seeds by Reducing Oxidative Stress and Increasing Antioxidative Activities.', 'Chemopreventive Efficacy of Thymoquinone in Chemically Induced Urinary Bladder Carcinogenesis in Rat.']"""

Aflibercept is a recombinant human fusion protein that binds A and B isoforms of VEGF and placental growth factor, thereby inhibiting angiogenesis. We assessed whether the addition of aflibercept to docetaxel and prednisone would improve overall survival in men with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer compared with the addition of placebo to docetaxel and prednisone.  Methods:   VENICE was a phase 3, multicentre, randomised double-blind placebo-controlled parallel group study done in 31 countries (187 sites). Men with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer, adequate organ function, and no prior chemotherapy were treated with docetaxel (75 mg/m(2) intravenously every 3 weeks) and oral prednisone (5 mg twice daily) and randomly allocated (1:1) to receive aflibercept (6 mg/kg) or placebo, intravenously, every 3 weeks. Treatment allocation was done centrally via an interactive voice response system, using a computer-generated sequence with a permuted-block size of four and stratified according Eastern Co-operative Group performance status (0-1 vs 2). Patients, investigators, and other individuals responsible for study conduct and data analysis were masked to treatment assignment. Aflibercept or placebo vials were supplied in identical boxes.

Interpretation:   Aflibercept in combination with docetaxel and prednisone given as first-line chemotherapy for men with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer resulted in no improvement in overall survival and added toxicity compared with placebo.

In order to qualify the spacer gel for the clinical use in particle therapy, a variety of measurements were performed in order to ensure the biological compatibility of the gel, its physical stability during and after the irradiation, and a proper definition of the gel in terms of the Hounsfield Unit (HU) values for the treatment planning system. The potential for the use of the spacer gel for particle therapy monitoring with off-line Positron Emission Tomography (PET) was also investigated.  Results:   The spacer gel implanted to the prostate patient in direct neighbourhood to the clinical target volume does not interfere with the particle therapy treatment planning procedure applied at Heidelberg Ion Beam Therapy Centre (HIT). The performed measurements show that Bragg-peak position of the particles can be properly predicted on the basis of computed tomography imaging with the treatment planning system used at HIT (measured water equivalent path length of 1.011 ±0.011 (2σ), measured Hounsfield Unit of 28.9 ±6.1 (2σ)). The spacer gel samples remain physically unchanged after irradiation with a dose exceeding the therapeutic dose level. The independently measured Bragg-Peak position does not change within the time interval of 10 weeks.  Conclusions:   As a result of the presented experiments, the first clinical application of spacer gel implant during prostate cancer treatment with carbon ions and protons was possible at HIT in 2012. The reported pre-clinical investigations demonstrate that use of spacer gel is safe in particle therapy in presence of therapy target motion and patient positioning induced particle range variations. The spacer gel injected between prostate and rectum enlarge the distance between both organs, which is expected to clinically significantly decrease the undesirable exposure of the most critical organ at risk, i.e. rectal frontal wall. Further research on the composition of spacer gel material might lead to additional clinical benefits by validation of particle therapy of prostate via post-therapeutic PET-imaging or by patient positioning based on the gel as a radio-opaque marker.""","""['Antoni Ruciński', 'Julia Bauer', 'Patrick Campbell', 'Stephan Brons', 'Daniel Unholtz', 'Gregor Habl', 'Klaus Herfarth', 'Jürgen Debus', 'Christoph Bert', 'Katia Parodi', 'Oliver Jäkel', 'Thomas Haberer']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Radiat Oncol""","""['Ion therapy of prostate cancer: daily rectal dose reduction by application of spacer gel.', 'Acute Toxicity and Quality of Life in Patients With Prostate Cancer Treated With Protons or Carbon Ions in a Prospective Randomized Phase II Study--The IPI Trial.', 'Evaluation of different fiducial markers for image-guided radiotherapy and particle therapy.', 'Imaging issues specific to hadrontherapy (proton, carbon, helium therapy and other charged particles) for radiotherapy planning, setup, dose monitoring and tissue response assessment.', 'High-dose-rate brachytherapy for prostate cancer in a previously radiated patient with polyethylene glycol hydrogel spacing to reduce rectal dose: case report and review of the literature.', 'EUS-guided hydrogel microparticle injection in a cadaveric model.', 'Surgical spacer placement for proton radiotherapy in locally advanced pancreatic body and tail cancers: initial clinical results.', 'An abdominal spacer that does not require surgical removal and allows drainage of abdominal fluids in patients undergoing carbon ion radiotherapy.', 'SpaceOAR to improve dosimetric outcomes for monotherapy high-dose-rate prostate implantation in a patient with ulcerative colitis.', 'Interdisciplinary consensus statement on indication and application of a hydrogel spacer for prostate radiotherapy based on experience in more than 250 patients.']"""

However, no data are yet available for the effects of VC on ED incidence after prostate cancer radiotherapy (XRT).  Aim:   To investigate the influence of VC on post-XRT ED incidence and to further characterize ED incidence by racial groups.  Main outcome measures:   ED incidence.  Methods:   We reviewed 732 charts of patients (267 Caucasian and 465 African American [AA]) who received prostate XRT (external beam radiotherapy and/or brachytherapy) with or without hormone therapy between 1999 and 2010. The number of pre-XRT VC (0, 1, 2, or 3) was determined by medical history and medication list. ED (defined by use of erectile aids or by documentation of moderate or high sexual dysfunction on patient history) was determined pre-XRT as well as 1, 2, and 4 years post-XRT.  Results:   ED incidence progressively increased from 22% pre-XRT to 58% 4 years post-XRT (P < 0.01). Additionally, ED incidence significantly increased with number of VC-4-year incidence between patients with 1 vs. 0 (P = 0.02), 2 vs. 0 (P < 0.01), 3 vs. 0 (P < 0.01), 3 vs. 1 (P < 0.01), and 3 vs. 2 (P = 0.04) VC (2 vs. 1 VC was nonsignificant). Compared with the Caucasian patients, ED incidences were slightly higher for the AA group with 0, 1, 2, and 3 comorbidities at 4 years follow-up (but statistically nonsignificant).  Conclusions:   The number of VCs have a significant effect on development of post-XRT ED. Pre- and post-XRT ED appear to be independent of race when number of VCs are considered. Our results can be used to guide physicians in counseling patients on the incidence of ED by number of VC and as preliminary data for prospective efforts aimed at reducing post-XRT ED.""","""['Yuefeng Wang', 'Tian Liu', 'Peter J Rossi', 'Deborah Watkins-Bruner', 'Wayland Hsiao', 'Sherrie Cooper', 'Xiaofeng Yang', 'Ashesh B Jani']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Sex Med""","""['Erectile function following external beam radiotherapy for clinically organ-confined or locally advanced prostate cancer.', 'Prevalence of Baseline Erectile Dysfunction (ED) in an Australian Cohort of Men with Localized Prostate Cancer.', 'Erectile dysfunction after external beam radiotherapy for prostate cancer.', 'The Natural History of Erectile Dysfunction After Prostatic Radiotherapy: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'Sexual dysfunction after curietherapy and external radiotherapy of the prostate for localized prostate cancer.', 'Male sexual dysfunction and rehabilitation strategies in the settings of salvage prostate cancer treatment.', 'Pharmacologic and surgical therapies for sexual dysfunction in male cancer survivors.']"""

QoL in MSM may not be reflected by assessment tools designed for the heterosexual population.  Aims:   Our goals were to evaluate post-treatment QoL in PCa patients who are MSM, and to investigate the utility of current QoL assessment tool.  Methods:   PCa patients treated with surgery and/or radiation were recruited from the local MSM community. Each participant completed the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) questionnaire, Male Sexual Health Questionnaire (MSHQ), and a questionnaire focused on insertive and receptive roles of anal intercourse.  Main outcome measures:   Response scores were calculated based on questionnaire design and compared by treatment modality.  Results:   Seven participants treated with surgery (mean age 58) and eight participants treated with radiation (mean age 67) were recruited. No participant in the surgical group received androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) while two in radiation group were treated with ADT. The sample size of this study did not permit formal statistical analysis, although potential differences in Urinary and Bowel Domains from EPIC and Ejaculation Scale from MSHQ were observed. More participants from the radiation group seemed to be able to maintain both insertive and receptive anal intercourse roles after treatment compared to participants who received surgery.  Conclusions:   While the two validated assessment tools suggested similar QoL scores including sexual function for both surgical and radiation groups, post-treatment sexual function related to anal intercourse may be better in the radiation group, as compared to the surgical group.

This study is aimed at investigating the expression of GP73 and its relationship with clinical pathological characters in gastric cancer.  Methods:   GP73 mRNA level was determined by quantitative real-time RT-PCR in 41 pairs of matched gastric tumorous tissues and adjacent non-tumorous mucosal tissues. Western blotting was also performed to detect the GP73 protein level. GP73 protein expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry in 52 clinically characterized gastric cancer patients and 10 non-tumorous gastric mucosal tissue controls.  Results:   The mRNA and protein level of GP73 were significantly down-regulated in gastric tumorous tissues compared with the non-tumorous mucosal tissues. In non-tumorous mucosa, strong diffuse cytoplasmic staining can be seen in cells located at the surface of the glandular and foveolar compartment; while in tumorous tissues, the staining was much weaker or even absent, and mainly in a semi-granular dot-like staining pattern. The expression level of GP73 protein was associated with patients' gender and tumor differentiation.  Conclusions:   GP73 was normally expressed in non-tumorous gastric mucosa and down-regulated in gastric cancer.

In the present study, we aimed to ascertain how EGF and the HH signaling transcription factor GLI-1 are linked in prostate cancer invasiveness. ARCaP human prostate cancer cells, which included ARCaPE and ARCaPM cells, were used as a model in the present study. The expression of EGF receptor (EGFR) and the HH signaling transcriptional factor GLI-1 were detected in ARCaPE cells by immunofluorescence, and the ARCaPE cells were treated with human recombinant EGF protein (hrEGF) for 4 consecutive days in vitro. Transwell invasion assays were performed in the ARCaPE cells following treatment with DMSO (vehicle control), hrEGF, GATN61 (GLI-1-specific inhibitor), hrEGF plus GANT61 and in the ARCaPM cells. The expression of phosphorylated extracellular signal regulated kinase (p-ERK), total ERK and GLI-1 was detected by western blotting in ARCaPE cells at different time-points following treatment with hrEGF. The expression of EGFR and GLI-1 was detected in ARCaPE cells, which exhibited a cobblestone-like morphology, while after treatment with hrEGF, the cell morphology was altered to a spindle-shaped mesenchymal cell morphology. Transwell invasion assays demonstrated that hrEGF dramatically enhanced the invasive capability of the ARCaPE cells (p<0.05). Additionally, western blot assay demonstrated that the expression levels of p-ERK and GLI-1 in ARCaPE cells increased in a time-dependent manner after treatment with hrEGF (p<0.05); however, the expression levels of total ERK in the cells remained relatively unchanged. It also demonstrated that the GLI-1 inhibitor GANT61 could reverse the enhanced invasive effect induced by EGF in ARCaPE cells (p<0.05). Our preliminary in vitro study showed that EGF signaling may increase the invasive capability of ARCaPE human prostate cancer cells via upregulation of p-ERK and the HH signaling transcriptional factor GLI-1. Additionally, this enhanced cell invasive effect was reversed by a GLI-1-specific inhibitor in vitro. Consequently, it indicates that both EGF and HH signaling are synergistically involved in the progression of human prostate cancer ARCaP cells, and GlI-1 may be one of the important effectors, which is activated by EGF downstream signaling, to promote the invasiveness of ARCaPE prostate cancer cells.""","""['Guodong Zhu', 'Jiancheng Zhou', 'Wenbin Song', 'Dapeng Wu', 'Qiang Dang', 'Linlin Zhang', 'Lei Li', 'Xinyang Wang', 'Dalin He']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Oncol Rep""","""['GLI-1 is involved in EGF-regulated enhancement of the invasiveness of prostate cancer ARCaP(E) cells in vitro.', 'Differential roles of ERK and Akt pathways in regulation of EGFR-mediated signaling and motility in prostate cancer cells.', 'Selective modulation of Hedgehog/GLI target gene expression by epidermal growth factor signaling in human keratinocytes.', 'Mitogen-activated protein kinases and Hedgehog-GLI signaling in cancer: A crosstalk providing therapeutic opportunities?', 'Nonclassical hedgehog-GLI signaling and its clinical implications.', 'Structure-based virtual screening identifies an 8-hydroxyquinoline as a small molecule GLI1 inhibitor.', 'Transcriptomic and Functional Screens Reveal MicroRNAs That Modulate Prostate Cancer Metastasis.', 'Non-canonical Hedgehog Signaling Pathway in Cancer: Activation of GLI Transcription Factors Beyond Smoothened.', 'Non-Canonical Hh Signaling in Cancer-Current Understanding and Future Directions.', 'Regulation of sonic hedgehog expression by integrin β1 and epidermal growth factor receptor in intestinal epithelium.']"""

This concept offers the possibility of developing a selective therapeutic approach in which cancer stem cells are directly targeted and killed. In this work, aptamers selected against DU145 prostate cancer cells (aptamer CSC1) and their subpopulation of cancer stem cells (aptamer CSC13) were linked to the surfaces of gold nanorods (AuNRs), and the resulting conjugates were successfully used to target and kill both cancer cells and cancer stem cells by near-infrared (NIR) laser irradiation.

The present study describes the prevalence of psychological distress in men with prostate cancer and their partners, and the predictors of adjustment outcomes.  Methods/design:   A cross-sectional survey of 189 prostate cancer patients who were scheduled for or had undergone surgery for localised prostate cancer and their partners assessed socio-demographic variables, masculine self-esteem and social intimacy, psychological adjustment and quality of life.  Results:   Overall, patients and partners reported low distress; however, female partners were more anxious with 36 % reporting mild to severe anxiety. For men, masculine self-esteem and time since diagnosis were most strongly related to mental health status; urinary bother most influenced physical quality of life. For female partners, the man's psychological distress and his sexual bother were most strongly related to her mental health status; higher social intimacy was most strongly associated with physical quality of life.

Methods and materials:   The CCP score was derived retrospectively from diagnostic biopsy specimens of men diagnosed with prostate cancer from 1991 to 2006 (n=141). All patients were treated with definitive EBRT; approximately half of the cohort was African American. Outcome was time from EBRT to BCR using the Phoenix definition. Median follow-up for patients without BCR was 4.8 years. Association with outcome was evaluated by Cox proportional hazards survival analysis and likelihood ratio tests.  Results:   Of 141 patients, 19 (13%) had BCR. The median CCP score for patient samples was 0.12. In univariable analysis, CCP score significantly predicted BCR (P=.0017). The hazard ratio for BCR was 2.55 for 1-unit increase in CCP score (equivalent to a doubling of gene expression). In a multivariable analysis that included Gleason score, prostate-specific antigen, percent positive cores, and androgen deprivation therapy, the hazard ratio for CCP changed only marginally and remained significant (P=.034), indicating that CCP provides prognostic information that is not provided by standard clinical parameters. With 10-year censoring, the CCP score was associated with prostate cancer-specific mortality (P=.013). There was no evidence for interaction between CCP and any clinical variable, including ethnicity.

Further, cases with high expression levels of both biomarkers were much more likely to have a more severe form of the disease at diagnosis than those with low expression levels. The two biomarkers had additive effects, rather than an interaction, upon disease-specific survival.

Here, we evaluate the use of the insect virus, baculovirus (BV), as a novel vector for human prostate cancer gene therapy. Since prostate tumours represent a heterogeneous environment, a therapeutic approach that achieves long-term regression must be capable of targeting multiple transformed cell populations. Furthermore, discrimination in the targeting of malignant compared to non-malignant cells would have value in minimising side effects. We employed a number of prostate cancer models to analyse the potential for BV to achieve these goals. In vitro, both traditional prostate cell lines as well as primary epithelial or stromal cells derived from patient prostate biopsies, in two- or three-dimensional cultures, were used. We also evaluated BV in vivo in murine prostate cancer xenograft models. BV was capable of preferentially transducing invasive malignant prostate cancer cell lines compared to early stage cancers and non-malignant samples, a restriction that was not a function of nuclear import. Of more clinical relevance, primary patient-derived prostate cancer cells were also efficiently transduced by BV, with robust rates observed in epithelial cells of basal phenotype, which expressed BV-encoded transgenes faster than epithelial cells of a more differentiated, luminal phenotype. Maximum transduction capacity was observed in stromal cells. BV was able to penetrate through three-dimensional structures, including in vitro spheroids and in vivo orthotopic xenografts. BV vectors containing a nitroreductase transgene in a gene-directed enzyme pro-drug therapy approach were capable of efficiently killing malignant prostate targets following administration of the pro-drug, CB1954. Thus, BV is capable of transducing a large proportion of prostate cell types within a heterogeneous 3-D prostate tumour, can facilitate cell death using a pro-drug approach, and shows promise as a vector for the treatment of prostate cancer.""","""['Stephanie L Swift', 'Guillermo C Rivera', 'Vincent Dussupt', 'Regina M Leadley', 'Lucy C Hudson', 'Corrina Ma de Ridder', 'Robert Kraaij', 'Julie E Burns', 'Norman J Maitland', 'Lindsay J Georgopoulos']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Synthetic switch-based baculovirus for transgene expression control and selective killing of hepatocellular carcinoma cells.', 'Development of the hybrid Sleeping Beauty: baculovirus vector for sustained gene expression and cancer therapy.', 'Adaptive immune responses elicited by baculovirus and impacts on subsequent transgene expression in vivo.', 'New targets for therapy in prostate cancer: modulation of stromal-epithelial interactions.', 'Baculovirus: an insect-derived vector for diverse gene transfer applications.', 'Evaluation of Baculoviruses as Gene Therapy Vectors for Brain Cancer.', 'Scientific Opinion on the update of the list of QPS-recommended biological agents intentionally added to food or feed as notified to EFSA.', 'Synthetic switch-based baculovirus for transgene expression control and selective killing of hepatocellular carcinoma cells.', 'Baculovirus-assisted Reovirus Infection in Monolayer and Spheroid Cultures of Glioma cells.', 'Bone Marrow Mesenchymal Stem Cells Expressing Baculovirus-Engineered Bone Morphogenetic Protein-7 Enhance Rabbit Posterolateral Fusion.']"""

While it was identified as a putative tumor suppressor in prostate cancer, likely due to its function as an effector of TGF-β in the inhibition of cell proliferation, KLF5 is unacetylated and promotes cell proliferation in the absence of TGF-β. In this study, we evaluated the expression and function of KLF5 in prostatic epithelial homeostasis and tumorigenesis using mouse prostates and human prostate epithelial cells in 3-D culture. Histological and molecular analyses demonstrated that unacetylated-Klf5 was expressed in basal or undifferentiated cells, whereas acetylated-Klf5 was expressed primarily in luminal and/or differentiated cells. Androgen depletion via castration increased both the level of Klf5 expression and the number of Klf5-positive cells in the remaining prostate. Functionally, knockdown of KLF5 in the human RWPE-1 prostate cell line decreased the number of spheres formed in 3-D culture. In addition, knockout of Klf5 in prostate epithelial cells, mediated by probasin promoter-driven Cre expression, did not cause neoplasia but promoted cell proliferation and induced hyperplasia when one Klf5 allele was knocked out. Knockout of both Klf5 alleles however, caused apoptosis rather than cell proliferation in the epithelium. In castrated mice, knockout of Klf5 resulted in more severe shrinkage of the prostate. These results suggest that KLF5 plays a role in the proliferation and differentiation of prostatic epithelial cells, yet loss of KLF5 alone is insufficient to induce malignant transformation in epithelial cells.""","""['Changsheng Xing', 'Xiaoying Fu', 'Xiaodong Sun', 'Peng Guo', 'Mei Li', 'Jin-Tang Dong']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Klf5 acetylation regulates luminal differentiation of basal progenitors in prostate development and regeneration.', 'Krüppel-like Factor 5, Increased in Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma, Promotes Proliferation, Acinar-to-Ductal Metaplasia, Pancreatic Intraepithelial Neoplasia, and Tumor Growth in Mice.', 'Klf5 deletion promotes Pten deletion-initiated luminal-type mouse prostate tumors through multiple oncogenic signaling pathways.', 'Essential role of KLF5 transcription factor in cell proliferation and differentiation and its implications for human diseases.', 'Roles of Krüppel-like factor 5 in kidney disease.', 'AR imposes different effects on ZFHX3 transcription depending on androgen status in prostate cancer cells.', 'Krüppel-like factor (KLF)5: An emerging foe of cardiovascular health.', 'The roles and regulation of the KLF5 transcription factor in cancers.', 'Acetylation of KLF5 maintains EMT and tumorigenicity to cause chemoresistant bone metastasis in prostate cancer.', 'Post-Translational Modifications That Drive Prostate Cancer Progression.']"""

Both questions are closely related as, e.g. a possible excessive therapy will result in additional suffering due to stress incontinence. For the most common, troublesome and expensive consequences of prostatectomy it is of interest to know which factors play a role in treatment reality and which could possibly be avoided.  Patients and methods:   The hospital records of all patients who underwent follow-up treatment after prostatectomy in 2009 at the clinic in the spa park in Bad Wildungen-Reinhardshausen were evaluated with respect to relevant data on outcome and clinical endpoints.  Results:   Of the 1,750 patients 405 (23.1 %) were continent on admission and discharge and a further 189 (10.8 %) were continent on discharge so that a total of 594 patients (33.9 %) were continent on discharge. Of the 1,155 patients (66.0 %) who were incontinent on admission and discharge, this remained the same during the rehabilitation period for 727 (62.9 %) who were diurnally incontinent and 659 (57.1 %) who were nocturnally incontinent. For 387 patients (33.5 %) the incontinence decreased during the day and for 370 (32.0 %) during the night, for 34 (3.4 %) the incontinence increased during the day and for 45 (3.9 %) during the night. An age < 60 years was advantageous for maintaining continence and in contrast > 70 years was disadvantageous. Retention of nerves showed a significant effect on maintaining continence. Statistically significant differences between the results of operative procedures and the results of the type of clinic (KKP communal, confessional and private or UK university clinic) were not observed. However, the results of maintaining continence (up to termination of rehabilitation treatment) for the 594 patients (33.9 %) was only achieved by 94 (51 %) of all 183 clinics, i.e. 78 (49.7 %) of the KKP clinics and 14 (53.9 %) of UK clinics. For the certified prostate centers of KKP and UK clinics this amounted to 17 (81 %) and 5 (83.3 %), respectively.  Conclusions:   In treatment reality of follow-up treatment of patients after prostatectomy in rehabilitation clinics approximately one third (33.9 %) achieved retention of continence up to discharge. An age < 60 years was advantageous and > 70 years disadvantageous. Bilateral and unilateral retention of nerves significantly improved retention of continence. The operative procedure and type of clinic did not significantly affect the results. However, in approximately one third of patients (33.9 %) retention of continence was achieved by only approximately one half (51.4 %) of all clinics. This shows that in treatment reality, stress incontinence following prostatectomy is avoidably underdeveloped and can be demonstrably increased by suitable operative techniques for sphincter protection.""","""['V Lent', 'H M Schultheis', 'L Strauß', 'M K Laaser', 'S Buntrock']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Urologe A""","""['Treatment of stress urinary incontinence after radical prostatectomy: adjustable transobturator male system - results of a multicenter prospective observational study.', 'Urinary incontinence after radical prostatectomy: incidence by definition, risk factors and temporal trend in a large series with a long-term follow-up.', 'Do early injections of bulking agents following radical prostatectomy improve early continence?', 'Two-stage management of severe postprostatectomy bladder neck contracture associated with stress incontinence.', 'Operative therapy for stress urinary incontinence in men--from sling to artificial sphincter.', 'Economic importance of postoperative urinary incontinence.', 'Radical prostatectomy in a certified prostate cancer center: medical treatment and outcome.']"""

Objective:   To investigate existing practices for patient involvement in patient safety, and opportunities and barriers for further involvement.  Design:   A qualitative study of patient safety involvement practices in patient trajectories for prostate, uterine and colorectal cancer in Denmark. Observations from four hospital wards and interviews with 25 patients with cancer, 11 hospital doctors, 10 nurses, four general practitioners and two private practicing gynaecologists were conducted using ethnographic methodology.  Findings:   Patient safety was not a topic of attention for patients or dominant in communication between patients and healthcare professionals. The understanding of patient safety in clinical practice is almost exclusively linked to disease management. Involvement of patients is not systematic, but healthcare professionals and patients express willingness to engage. Invitation and encouragement of patients to become involved could be further systematised and developed. Barriers include limited knowledge of patient safety, of specific patient safety involvement techniques and concern regarding potential negative impact on doctor-patient relationship.  Conclusions:   Involvement of patients in patient safety must take into account that despite stated openness to the idea of involvement, patients and health professionals may not in practice show immediate concern. Lack of systematic involvement can also be attributed to limited knowledge about how to implement involvement beyond the focus of self-monitoring and compliance and a concern about the consequences of patient involvement for treatment outcomes.

However, studies evaluating this association using C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 as markers of inflammation have reported conflicting results. We investigated the associations of three common markers of inflammation (CRP, fibrinogen and leukocyte count) with the risk of prostate cancer in a prospective cohort of 2,571 men from Finland. During an average follow-up period of 24 years (21-26 years), 203 men from the cohort who developed prostate cancer were identified via linkage to the nationwide Finnish Cancer Registry. We investigated the associations between the markers and the risk of prostate cancer using Cox proportional hazards model, adjusting for potential confounders. Elevated prediagnostic leukocyte count was associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer. In multivariable adjusted model, the relative risk of prostate cancer among men in the highest tertile of leukocyte count compared to men in the lowest tertile was 1.60 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.10-2.29, p-trend = 0.01). Circulating CRP and fibrinogen were not associated with increased risk. The corresponding relative risks for elevated CRP and fibrinogen concentrations were 1.08 (95% CI: 0.74-1.60, p-trend = 0.56) and 1.25 (95% CI: 0.87-1.81, p-trend = 0.14), respectively.

Patients and methods:   A retrospective analysis was carried out for consecutive patients who underwent 1.5 Tesla eMRI for local staging before open radical prostatectomy. The cohort was dichotomized into patients with apparent or inapparent tumour on eMRI. The results were compared with final histopathology, and an analysis for presence of clinically significance PCa was performed.  Results:   A total of 385 patients were included in the study; in 85 patients (22 %), no apparent lesion suspicious for PCa was detected on eMRI, still final pathology revealed clinically significant PCa in 61 of these patients (72 %). In contrast, 256 (85 %) of the 300 patients with apparent tumour in eMRI harboured clinically significant PCa. eMRI could not differentiate clinically significant from insignificant PCa in neither of the groups (p > 0.6).  Conclusions:   Presence of clinically significant cancer cannot be excluded by high-resolution 1.5 Tesla T2-weighted eMRI.

African Americans have more aggressive tumors at every clinical stage of the disease, resulting in poorer prognosis and increased mortality. A major barrier to identifying crucial gene activity differences is heterogeneity, including tissue composition variation intrinsic to the histology of prostate cancer. We hypothesized that differences in gene expression in specific tissue types would reveal mechanisms involved in the racial disparities of prostate cancer. We examined 17 pairs of arrays for AAs and Caucasians that were formed by closely matching the samples based on the known tissue type composition of the tumors. Using pair-wise t-test we found significantly altered gene expression between AAs and CAs. Independently, we performed multiple linear regression analyses to associate gene expression with race considering variation in percent tumor and stroma tissue. The majority of differentially expressed genes were associated with tumor-adjacent stroma rather than tumor tissue. Extracellular matrix, integrin family and signaling mediators of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) pathways were all downregulated in stroma of AAs. Using MetaCore (GeneGo) analysis, we observed that 35% of significant (p < 10(-3)) pathways identified EMT and 25% identified immune response pathways especially for interleukins-2, -4, -5, -6, -7, -10, -13, -15 and -22 as the major changes.

Expectedly, a significant portion of these actions of P-Rex proteins must be related to their Rac regulatory properties. In addition, P-Rex proteins control signaling by the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) route by interacting with PTEN and mTOR. The interaction with PTEN inhibits its phosphatase activity, leading to AKT activation. The interaction with mTOR may be important in nutrient-stimulated Rac activation and migration. In humans, several studies have implicated P-Rex proteins in the pathophysiology of various neoplasias. Thus, overexpression of P-Rex proteins has been linked to poor patient outcome in breast cancer and may facilitate metastatic dissemination of prostate cancer cells. In addition, whole-genome sequencing described P-Rex2 as a significantly mutated gene in melanoma. Furthermore, expression in melanocytes of mutated forms of P-Rex2 found in patients with melanoma showed the protumorigenic role of these P-Rex mutations in melanoma genesis. These findings open interesting opportunities for P-Rex targeting in cancer. Moreover, the implication of P-Rex partner proteins such as Rac, mTOR, or PTEN in cancer has opened the possibility of acting on P-Rex to restrict protumorigenic signaling through these pathways.""","""['Atanasio Pandiella', 'Juan Carlos Montero']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Clin Cancer Res""","""['Phosphorylation of P-Rex1 at serine 1169 participates in IGF-1R signaling in breast cancer cells.', 'Structural analysis of the PTEN:P-Rex2 signaling complex reveals how cancer-associated mutations coordinate to hyperactivate Rac1.', 'A detailed immunohistochemical analysis of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway in lung cancer: correlation with PIK3CA, AKT1, K-RAS or PTEN mutational status and clinicopathological features.', 'P-Rex1 and P-Rex2 RacGEFs and cancer.', 'Targeting the translational apparatus to improve leukemia therapy: roles of the PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR pathway.', 'Comparative Transcriptomic Analysis of Archival Human Vestibular Schwannoma Tissue from Patients with and without Tinnitus.', 'Genomic Complexity Predicts Resistance to Endocrine Therapy and CDK4/6 Inhibition in Hormone Receptor-Positive (HR+)/HER2-Negative Metastatic Breast Cancer.', 'Distinct gene mutation profiles among multiple and single primary lung adenocarcinoma.', 'Nomogram model characterized by mutant genes and clinical indexes to identify high-risk patients with stage III/IV colorectal cancer.', 'PDCD4 limits prooncogenic neuregulin-ErbB signaling.']"""

An activatable optical imaging probe based on a cys-diabody targeting prostate-specific membrane antigen conjugated with the near-infrared fluorophore, indocyanine green (ICG), was designed such that it can only be activated when bound to the tumor, leading to high signal-to-background ratios. We employed short polyethylene glycol (PEG) linkers between the ICG and the reactive functional group (Sulfo-OSu group), resulting in covalent conjugation of ICG to the cys-diabody, which led to lower dissociation of ICG from cys-diabody early after injection, reducing hepatic uptake. However, unexpectedly, high and long-term fluorescence was observed in the kidneys, liver, and blood pool more than 1 h after injection of the cys-diabody PEG-ICG conjugate. A biodistribution study using I125-labeled cys-diabody-ICG showed immediate uptake in the kidneys followed by a rapid decrease, while gastric activity increased due to released radioiodine during rapid cys-diabody-ICG catabolism in the kidneys. To avoid this catabolic pathway, it would be preferable to use antibody fragments large enough not to be filtered through glomerulus or to conjugate the fragments with fluorescent dyes that are readily excreted into urine when cleaved from the cys-diabody to achieve high tumor-specific detection.""","""['Kohei Sano', 'Takahito Nakajima', 'Towhid Ali', 'Derek W Bartlett', 'Anna M Wu', 'Insook Kim', 'Chang H Paik', 'Peter L Choyke', 'Hisataka Kobayashi']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Biomed Opt""","""['Short PEG-linkers improve the performance of targeted, activatable monoclonal antibody-indocyanine green optical imaging probes.', 'Synthesis, Positron Emission Tomography Imaging, and Therapy of Diabody Targeted Drug Lipid Nanoparticles in a Prostate Cancer Murine Model.', 'Site-specific conjugation of monodispersed DOTA-PEGn to a thiolated diabody reveals the effect of increasing peg size on kidney clearance and tumor uptake with improved 64-copper PET imaging.', 'Activatable Alexa Fluor680-conjugated panitumumab and indocyanine green-conjugated trastuzumab cocktail.', ""64Cu-1,4,7,10-Tetraazacyclododecane-N,N',N'',N'''-tetraacetic acid-polyethylene glycol 12 anti–tumor-associated glycoprotein 72 diabody."", 'Mucins as contrast agent targets for fluorescence-guided surgery of pancreatic cancer.', 'The application of indocyanine green in guiding prostate cancer treatment.', 'Near-infrared fluorescence guided surgery: State of the evidence from a health technology assessment perspective.', 'Comparison of Five Near-Infrared Fluorescent Folate Conjugates in an Ovarian Cancer Model.', 'NIR fluorescence-guided tumor surgery: new strategies for the use of indocyanine green.']"""

Design, setting, and participants:   Prospective study of 4577 men with nonmetastatic prostate cancer in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (1986-2010).  Exposures:   Postdiagnostic intake of saturated, monounsaturated, polyunsaturated, trans, animal, and vegetable fat.  Main outcomes and measures:   Lethal prostate cancer (distant metastases or prostate cancer-specific death) and all-cause mortality.  Results:   We observed 315 events of lethal prostate cancer and 1064 deaths (median follow-up, 8.4 years). Crude rates per 1000 person-years for lethal prostate cancer were as follows (highest vs lowest quintile of fat intake): 7.6 vs 7.3 for saturated, 6.4 vs 7.2 for monounsaturated, 5.8 vs 8.2 for polyunsaturated, 8.7 vs 6.1 for trans, 8.3 vs 5.7 for animal, and 4.7 vs 8.7 for vegetable fat. For all-cause mortality, the rates were 28.4 vs 21.4 for saturated, 20.0 vs 23.7 for monounsaturated, 17.1 vs 29.4 for polyunsaturated, 32.4 vs 17.1 for trans, 32.0 vs 17.2 for animal, and 15.4 vs 32.7 for vegetable fat. Replacing 10% of energy intake from carbohydrate with vegetable fat was associated with a lower risk of lethal prostate cancer (hazard ratio [HR], 0.71; 95% CI, 0.51-0.98; P = .04) and all-cause mortality (HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.61-0.88; P = .001).

By screening the protective, recurrence-derived VSV-cDNA library, here we identify topoisomerase-IIα (TOPO-IIα) as a recurrence-specific tumor antigen against which tolerance can be broken. Tumor recurrences, in two different types of tumor (prostate and melanoma), which had evaded two different frontline treatments (immunotherapy or chemotherapy), significantly overexpressed TOPO-IIα compared with their primary tumor counterparts, which conferred a novel sensitivity to doxorubicin (DOX) chemotherapy upon the recurrent tumors. This was exploited in vivo using combination therapies to cure mice, which would otherwise have relapsed, after suboptimal primary therapy in both models. Our data show that recurrent tumors-across histologies and primary treatments-express distinct antigens compared with the primary tumor which can be identified using the VSV-cDNA library technology.

We conducted a retrospective multicenter study to determine the effect of body mass index (BMI) on the clinicopathological characteristics and biochemical recurrence of PCa in Japanese men who underwent RP.  Methods:   The medical records of 1257 men with PCa treated by RP without neoadjuvant therapy at four medical institutes between 2001 and 2009 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were categorized into four groups using the World Health Organization (WHO) BMI classification and BMI quartiles. Associations of the various BMI categories with clinicopathological characteristics and biochemical recurrences were statistically evaluated. Biochemical recurrence was defined as a PSA level of >0.2 ng ml(-1).  Results:   Of the 1257 patients, 230 (18.3%) experienced biochemical recurrence during the median follow-up period of 49 months. The median BMI was 23.8 kg m(-2), and 1.4% patients were underweight, 65.4% were of normal weight, 30.9% were overweight and 2.4% were obese (WHO classification). Preoperative PSA levels and PSA density (PSAD) tended to decrease as BMI increased. Pathological characteristics did not differ significantly among BMI categories. As per the WHO classification and quartile categories, biochemical recurrence rate was comparable among the BMI groups. After adjusting for other pre- and postoperative covariables, multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis revealed that a high BMI did not have an independent impact on biochemical recurrence-free survival.

Parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) is produced by PCa cells and intermittent PTHrP exposure has bone anabolic effects, suggesting that PTHrP could contribute to the excess bone mineralization. Wnts are bone-productive factors produced by PCa cells, and the Wnt inhibitor Dickkopfs-1 (DKK1) has been shown to promote PCa progression. These findings, in conjunction with the observation that PTHrP expression increases and DKK1 expression decreases as PCa progresses, led to the hypothesis that PTHrP could be a negative regulator of DKK1 expression in PCa cells and, hence, allow the osteoblastic activity of Wnts to be realized. To test this, we first demonstrated that PTHrP downregulated DKK1 mRNA and protein expression. We then found through multiple mutated DKK1 promoter assays that PTHrP, through c-Jun activation, downregulated the DKK1 promoter through a transcription factor (TCF) response element site. Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and re-ChIP assays revealed that PTHrP mediated this effect through inducing c-Jun to bind to a transcriptional activator complex consisting of β-catenin, which binds the most proximal DKK1 promoter, the TCF response element. Together, these results demonstrate a novel signaling linkage between PTHrP and Wnt signaling pathways that results in downregulation of a Wnt inhibitor allowing for Wnt activity that could contribute the osteoblastic nature of PCa.""","""['H Zhang', 'C Yu', 'J Dai', 'J M Keller', 'A Hua', 'J L Sottnik', 'G Shelley', 'C L Hall', 'S I Park', 'Z Yao', 'J Zhang', 'L K McCauley', 'E T Keller']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['Wnt signaling induces gene expression of factors associated with bone destruction in lung and breast cancer.', 'DKK1 promotes migration and invasion of non-small cell lung cancer via β-catenin signaling pathway.', ""Wnt/β-Catenin Signaling Activation beyond Robust Nuclear β-Catenin Accumulation in Nondysplastic Barrett's Esophagus: Regulation via Dickkopf-1."", 'Role of Wnts in prostate cancer bone metastases.', 'Drug Discovery of DKK1 Inhibitors.', 'Tumor microenvironment involvement in colorectal cancer progression via Wnt/β-catenin pathway: Providing understanding of the complex mechanisms of chemoresistance.', 'ZBTB38 suppresses prostate cancer cell proliferation and migration via directly promoting DKK1 expression.', 'HomeoboxC6 promotes metastasis by orchestrating the DKK1/Wnt/β-catenin axis in right-sided colon cancer.', 'Ras and Wnt Interaction Contribute in Prostate Cancer Bone Metastasis.', 'DKK1 and Kremen Expression Predicts the Osteoblastic Response to Bone Metastasis.']"""

The delivery of siRNA into specific cells is a key requirement for its clinical application. Recent reports have indicated that antibody-mediated siRNA delivery is an effective approach for targeted knockdown of specific genes in appropriate cells. Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is regarded as an ideal target for the delivery of therapeutic agents to prostate cancer cells. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate whether siRNA can be efficiently delivered into PSMA-positive prostate cancer cells using two fusion proteins, s-tP and sFH-tP. These fusion proteins are composed of an anti-PSMA single chain antibody (scFv, abbreviated as an ""s"") and a truncated protamine (tP); and in sFH-tP a furin cleavage site and an HA2 fragment sequence (FH) were inserted between the scFv and tP domains. Our results showed that siRNA can be specifically delivered into PSMA-positive LNCaP cells by these two fusion proteins, with the sFH-tP fusion protein being more effective. Efficient knockdown of Notch1 by siNotch1 delivered by either fusion protein was observed in PSMA-positive LNCaP cells and in LNCaP xenografted nude mice. Further experiments confirmed that the fusion protein-delivered siNotch1 could efficiently inhibit PSMA-positive LNCaP cell proliferation and promote apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo.

No patient had previously received 5α-reductase inhibitor, luteinizing hormone-releasing analogs or testosterone replacement treatment. The patient population was grouped according to the pGS as 6 = 3+3, 7 = 3+4, 7 = 4+3 and 8-10. Eight variables were simultaneously investigated in each group: prostate-specific antigen (PSA), TT, free testosterone, age, percentage of positive prostate biopsy cores (P+), biopsy Gleason score (bGS), overall cancer volume estimated as percentage of prostate volume (V+) and prostate weight (Wi). Univariate analysis of variance (ANOVA), multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) and multivariate discriminant analysis (MDA) were the statistical methods used for evaluating the data.  Results:   There were 89 patients in pGS 6 = 3+3, 84 in pGS 7 = 3+4, 24 in pGS 7 = 4+3 and 23 in pGS 8-10.

POTE protein is a newly identified cancer antigen that was found to be expressed in a wide variety of human cancers, including prostate, colon, lung, breast, ovary and pancreas. Here, we determined HLA-A2.1-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) epitopes in the POTE protein, and also designed enhanced epitopes by amino acid (AA) substitutions. Five 9-mer peptides were first selected and their binding affinity to HLA-A2 molecules was measured by the T2 binding assay. POTE 272-280 and POTE 323-331 showed the strongest HLA-A2 binding affinity. AA substituted peptides POTE 252-9V (with valine at position 9), POTE 553-1Y (with tyrosine at position 1) and POTE 323-3F (with phenylalanine at position 3) conferred higher affinity for HLA-A2, and induced CTL responses cross-reactive with wild type antigens. While POTE 252-9V was the strongest in this respect, POTE 323-3F had the greatest increase in immunogenicity compared to wild type. Importantly, two modified epitopes (POTE-553-1Y and POTE-323-3F) induced CTLs that killed NCI-H522, a POTE-expressing HLA-A2(+) human non-small cell lung cancer cell line, indicating natural endogenous processing of these epitopes. In conclusion, the immunogenicity of POTE epitopes can be enhanced by peptide modification to induce T cells that kill human cancer cells.

Secondary aims included examining physical activity (PA) levels by treatment type and domain (leisure, work, transport and domestic) and establishing a predictive model of the likelihood that men with PCa would meet NPAGA.  Methods:   A questionnaire was mailed to 638 men with PCa attending for treatment at the Alfred, Cabrini or Latrobe Regional Hospitals during 2010 and 2011, with a response rate of 59%. Measures included International Physical Activity Questionnaire, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Prostate and sociodemographic items. Inclusion criteria were English speaking men aged 40 to 80 years, who had undergone radiotherapy (RT) between 9 and 30 months prior to the survey.  Results:   Of 356 men with PCa, less than half were meeting NPAGA (41.9%). Lower education and quality of life (QoL), a higher number of comorbid conditions and symptoms of depression and anxiety were associated with decreased leisure-time PA. Patients treated with androgen deprivation therapy were significantly less active than patients treated with RT only. Logistic regression analyses indicated that the likelihood of meeting NPAGA was significantly lower with higher levels of depressive symptoms and lower levels of education.  Conclusions:   Meeting NPAGA is associated with higher QoL and psychosocial well-being in men with PCa. These findings contribute important information for targeting PA interventions to PCa survivors.""","""['Kelly Chipperfield', 'Jane Fletcher', 'Jeremy Millar', 'Joanne Brooker', 'Robin Smith', 'Mark Frydenberg', 'Tracy Oh', 'Sue Burney']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Psychooncology""","""['Predictors of depression, anxiety and quality of life in patients with prostate cancer receiving androgen deprivation therapy.', 'Evaluation of the association of prostate cancer-specific anxiety with sexual function, depression and cancer aggressiveness in men 1 year following surgical treatment for localized prostate cancer.', 'Comparison of self-estimation of disuric disorders gauged IPSS scale and qualities of lives QoL with self-estimation of sexual life gauged by IIEF-5 scale.', 'The impact of physical activity on psychosocial outcomes in men receiving androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer: a systematic review.', 'Living with untreated prostate cancer: predictors of quality of life.', 'Prognostic factors of adherence to home-based exercise therapy in patients with chronic diseases: A systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Antidepressant medication use and prostate cancer recurrence in men with depressive disorders.', 'Problem-solving skills training in adult cancer survivors: Bright IDEAS-AC pilot study.', 'Feasibility and Safety of Physical Exercise to Preserve Bone Health in Men With Prostate Cancer Receiving Androgen Deprivation Therapy: A Systematic Review.', 'Home-based Physical Activity to Alleviate Fatigue in Cancer Survivors: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.']"""

Aberrant microenvironments including hypoxia and acidic pH are common features of most solid tumors that have been long associated with enhanced metastasis and poor patient outcomes. Novel approaches to reduce metastatic incidences and improve overall survival of cancer patients clearly are needed. The crucial role of Cathepsin L (CTSL) in the dissemination of tumor cells has led to the development of novel cathepsin L inhibition strategies. The present study evaluated the ability of KGP94, a small molecule inhibitor of CTSL, to impair the metastatic phenotype of prostate (PC-3ML) and breast (MDA-MB-231) cancer cells both under normal and aberrant microenvironmental conditions. To assess the role of CTSL in hypoxia and acidosis triggered metastasis associated cell functions, secreted CTSL levels were determined under conditions pertinent to the tumor microenvironment. Acute exposures to hypoxic or acidic conditions significantly elevated secreted CTSL levels either through an increase in intracellular CTSL levels or through activation of lysosomal exocytosis or both, depending on the tumor type. Increases in CTSL secretion closely paralleled enhanced tumor cell migration and invasion suggesting that CTSL could be an essential factor in tumor microenvironment triggered metastasis. Importantly, KGP94 treatment led to marked attenuation of tumor cell invasion and migration under both normal and aberrant microenvironmental conditions suggesting that it may have significant utility as an anti-metastatic agent.""","""['Dhivya R Sudhan', 'Dietmar W Siemann']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Clin Exp Metastasis""","""['Cathepsin L inactivation leads to multimodal inhibition of prostate cancer cell dissemination in a preclinical bone metastasis model.', 'Cathepsin L in tumor angiogenesis and its therapeutic intervention by the small molecule inhibitor KGP94.', 'Synthesis and biological evaluation of a water-soluble phosphate prodrug salt and structural analogues of KGP94, a lead inhibitor of cathepsin L.', 'Cathepsin L targeting in cancer treatment.', 'Molecular insights into prostate cancer progression: the missing link of tumor microenvironment.', 'Cathepsins Trigger Cell Death and Regulate Radioresistance in Glioblastoma.', 'In Vitro Veritas: From 2D Cultures to Organ-on-a-Chip Models to Study Immunogenic Cell Death in the Tumor Microenvironment.', 'Methyltransferase-like 3 promotes cervical cancer metastasis by enhancing cathepsin L mRNA stability in an N6-methyladenosine-dependent manner.', 'Cysteine Cathepsins in Breast Cancer: Promising Targets for Fluorescence-Guided Surgery.', 'Formulation of a Thermosensitive Imaging Hydrogel for Topical Application and Rapid Visualization of Tumor Margins in the Surgical Cavity.']"""

To identify new approaches to treat androgen-dependent prostate cancer, we have performed a structure-activity analysis of lignan polyphenols for cancer cell specific sensitization to tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), a death ligand that has ability to induce tumor-specific cell death. In this study, we report that the lignan nortrachelogenin (NTG) is the most efficient of the 27 tested lignan compounds in sensitizing prostate cancer cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Importantly, pretreatment with NTG does not sensitize a non-malignant prostate cell line to TRAIL-induced cell death. The structural comparison of lignans reveals that the dibenzylbutyrolactone skeleton is required for the apoptosis-sensitizing activity, while substitutions at the aromatic rings do not seem to play a critical role in this lignan function. Our study also characterizes the cellular effects and molecular mechanisms involved in NTG anticancer activity. We previously reported that specific lignans inhibit the Akt survival-signaling pathway in concert with TRAIL sensitization. While NTG is also shown to be a effective inhibitor of Akt signaling, in this study we further demonstrate that NTG potently inhibits tyrosine kinase (RTK) activation in response to growth factors, such as insulin and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I).

However, the mechanism by which lycopene attenuates prostate cancer is not fully defined. In this study we examined the effect of lycopene on proliferation, survival, and biomarker gene expression in prostate cancer (PC-3) cells in culture. WST-1 assay showed that lycopene induces a biphasic effect on PC-3 cells with a modest increase in proliferation at 1-5 μM, no change at 10-25 μM and a decrease at 50-100 μM doses in culture. Interestingly, combination treatment with lycopene induced anti-proliferative effect of Temozolomide on PC-3 cells. Lycopene also augmented the anti-proliferative effect of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) agonists, but not Doxorubicin or Taxol, in prostate cancer.

Methods:   We evaluated ERG protein expression in 344 patients with PCa in 3 cohorts including localized, metastatic, and castration-resistant disease using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH).  Results:   ERG protein expression was detected exclusively in the neoplastic epithelium and was found in 6.8% and 46.3% of high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN) and localized PCa, respectively. In metastatic and locally advanced CRPC, ERG expression was significantly lower, occurring at 36.1% and 37.2%, respectively. In PCa with foamy gland morphology, ERG protein expression was detected in only 18.6% compared with reported rates of about 42%-48% in acinar PCa. Moreover, ERG protein expression and gene rearrangements showed an overall consistency rate of 90.6% (P <.0001). The consistency rate was 100% both in benign glands and HGPIN, and 96.1% in localized PCa. However, it was significantly lower at 76.9% and 85% in node metastatic and CRPC, respectively (P <.0001).  Conclusion:   ERG protein expression is restricted to neoplastic prostatic epithelium and is present at lower rates in metastatic and CRPC compared to localized PCa. IHC and FISH concordance rates were significantly lower in node metastatic and CRPC compared to localized PCa, which may suggest different biological and therapeutic implications.

Materials and methods:   Study subjects were men aged 54-67 years with an elevated PSA (≥4 ng/mL or 3-4 ng/mL and free to total PSA ratio ≤0.16 or positive digital rectal examination), but a benign biopsy result within the Finnish population-based randomised screening trial for PCa, which started in 1996. A total of 293 prostate biopsies without PCa or suspicion of malignancy from the first screening round in the Tampere centre were re-evaluated by a uropathologist to assess histological inflammation. Results of the subsequent screening rounds were obtained from the trial database and PCa diagnoses made outside the screening were obtained from the Finnish Cancer Registry. The median length of follow-up was 10.5 years. Cox regression analysis was used to assess PCa risk after the initial benign biopsy.  Results:   Histological inflammation was found in 66% of the biopsies. Subjects with inflammation at the biopsy had a slightly lower PCa risk in the second screening round (18 vs 27%, rate ratio 0.69, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.35-1.34) relative to men without inflammation. In further follow-up, the PCa risk remained nonsignificantly lower (hazard ratio [HR] 0.71, CI 0.46-1.10; P = 0.13). The risk was not appreciably affected by adjustment for age, PSA, prostate volume and family history of PCa (HR 0.67, CI 0.42-1.07; P = 0.092).

Patients and methods:   We examined the data of 524 patients treated with RP, between 2000 and 2012. All fulfilled at least one of four commonly used AS criteria. Regression models tested the relationship between positive cores spatial distribution, defined as the number of positive zones at biopsy (PBxZ) and tumour laterality at biopsy and two endpoints: (i) unfavourable prostate cancer at RP (Gleason score ≥ 4 + 3, and/or pT3 disease), and (ii) clinically significant prostate cancer (tumour volume ≥ 2.5 mL).  Results:   Unfavourable prostate cancer and clinically significant prostate cancer rates were 8 and 25%, respectively. Patients with more than one PBxZ had a 3.2-fold higher risk of harbouring unfavourable prostate cancer, and a 2.3-fold higher risk of harbouring clinically significant prostate cancer compared with their counterparts with one PBxZ (both P = 0.01). Patients with bilateral tumour at biopsy had a 3.3-fold higher risk of harbouring unfavourable prostate cancer and a 1.7-fold higher risk of harbouring clinically significant prostate cancer compared with their counterparts with unilateral tumour at biopsy (both P ≤ 0.04). Some of these results did not reach a statistically significant level, when the analyses were restricted to patients that fulfilled the most stringent AS criteria.  Conclusions:   Positive cores spatial distribution at biopsy should be considered, when advising patients about AS. The addition of this predictor to AS inclusion criteria can help identifying patients at a higher risk of progression, and reduce the rate of inappropriate surveillance of aggressive tumours. However, the most stringent AS criteria (namely John-Hopkins criteria and Prostate Cancer Research International: Active Surveillance criteria) might not benefit from the addition of this predictor.

To investigate whether a clinically meaningful PSA threshold for AS eligibility/ineligibility for men with low PSAD can be identified based on risk of subsequent biopsy reclassification.  Patients and methods:   We included men enrolled in the Johns Hopkins AS Study (JHAS) who had a PSAD of <0.15 ng/mL/g (640 men). We estimated the incidence rates (IRs; per 100 person years) and hazard ratios (HR) of biopsy reclassification (Gleason score ≥ 7, any Gleason pattern 4 or 5, ≥3 positive cores, or ≥50% cancer involvement/biopsy core) for categories of serum PSA concentration at the time of entry into AS. We generated predicted IRs using Poisson regression to adjust for age and prostate volume, mean percentage free PSA (ratio of free to total PSA) and maximum percentage biopsy core involvement with cancer.  Results:   The unadjusted IRs (per 100 person years) of biopsy reclassification across serum PSA concentration at entry into JHAS showed, in general, an increase; however, the pattern was not linear with higher IRs in the group ≥ 4 to <6 ng/mL (14.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] 11.8-17.2%) when compared with ≥6 to <8 ng/mL (8.4, 95% CI 5.7-12.3%) but almost similar IRs when compared with the group ≥ 8 to <10 ng/mL (14.8, 95% CI 8.4-26.1%). The adjusted predicted IRs of reclassification showed a similar non-linear increase in IRs, whereby the rates around 4 ng/mL were similar to the rates around 10 ng/mL.  Conclusion:   Risk for biopsy reclassification increased non-linearly across PSA concentration in men with low PSAD, whereby no obvious clinically meaningful threshold could be identified. This information could be incorporated into decision-making for AS.

Material and method:   One hundred twenty men underwent laparoscopic radical prostatectomy between October 2006 and December 2011. Four men were excluded due to open surgical conversions and fourteen men were excluded due to lacking of follow-up. The remaining 102 men had a mean preoperative prostate specific antigen of 21.4 ng/ml (ranging from 0.4 to 185) and Gleason score of 6.2 (ranging from 6 to 10). Stage was cT1b in one case (1%), cT1c in 66 (64.7%), cT2 in 28 (27. 5%), and cT3 in seven (6.9%). Immediate postoperative adjuvant therapy of twenty-six men was excluded from biochemical recurrence analysis.  Results:   Mean follow-up period was 19.7 months (median 16, ranging from 2 to 54.8). Pathological stage was pT0N0 in two men (2%), pT2N0 in 78 (76.5%), pT3N0 in 11 (10.8%), and pT2-3N1 in 11 (10.8%).

These assessments are extremely time consuming, highly subjective and prone to error, since immunohistochemically stained cancer tissues usually show high variability in cell sizes, morphological structures and staining quality. To facilitate reproducible analysis in clinical practice as well as for cancer research, objective computer assisted staining estimation is highly desirable.  Methods:   We employ machine learning algorithms as randomized decision trees and support vector machines for nucleus detection and classification. Superpixels as segmentation over the tissue image are classified into foreground and background and thereafter into malignant and benign, learning from the user's feedback. As a fast alternative without nucleus classification, the existing color deconvolution method is incorporated.  Results:   Our program TMARKER connects already available workflows for computational pathology and immunohistochemical tissue rating with modern active learning algorithms from machine learning and computer vision. On a test dataset of human renal clear cell carcinoma and prostate carcinoma, the performance of the used algorithms is equivalent to two independent pathologists for nucleus detection and classification.  Conclusion:   We present a novel, free and operating system independent software package for computational cell counting and staining estimation, supporting IHC stained tissue analysis in clinic and for research. Proprietary toolboxes for similar tasks are expensive, bound to specific commercial hardware (e.g. a microscope) and mostly not quantitatively validated in terms of performance and reproducibility.

To determine whether Ski-interacting protein (SKIP) regulates TGF- β 1-stimulated expression of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), and uPA Inhibitor (PAI-1) in the androgen-independent human prostate cancer cell model. Materials and Methods. PC-3 prostate cancer cell line was used. The role of SKIP was evaluated using synthetic small interference RNA (siRNA) compounds. The expression of uPA, MMP-9, and PAI-1 was evaluated by zymography assays, RT-PCR, and promoter transactivation analysis. Results. In PC-3 cells TGF- β 1 treatment stimulated uPA, PAI-1, and MMP-9 expressions. The knockdown of SKIP in PC-3 cells enhanced the basal level of uPA, and TGF- β 1 treatment inhibited uPA production. Both PAI-1 and MMP-9 production levels were increased in response to TGF- β 1. The ectopic expression of SKIP inhibited both TGF- β 1-induced uPA and MMP-9 promoter transactivation, while PAI-1 promoter response to the factor was unaffected. Conclusions. SKIP regulates the expression of uPA, PAI-1, and MMP-9 stimulated by TGF- β 1 in PC-3 cells.

STUDY PROCEDURES: We searched biomedical literature databases up to November 2011 and included epidemiological studies with description of long chain n-3 PUFA and incidence of prostate cancer in humans. Critical appraisal was done by two independent reviewers. Data were pooled using the general variance-based method with random-effects model; effect estimates were expressed as risk ratio with 95% confidence interval (CI). Heterogeneity was assessed by Chi(2) and quantified by I(2), publication bias was also determined.  Results:   In total, 12 studies were included. Significant negative association was noted between high serum level of n-3 PUFA doc-osapentaenoic acid (DPA) and total prostate cancer risk (RR:0.756; 95% CI 0.599, 0.955; p = 0.019). Likewise, a positive association between high blood level of fish oil contents, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and high-grade prostate tumour incidence (RR:1.381; 95% CI 1.050, 1.817; p = 0.021) was noted; however, this finding was evident only after adjustment was done on interstudy variability through the removal of a lower quality study from the pool.

We present an immunocytochemical study of the effect of androgen blockade on the expression of HER-2 and MMP-2 in bone marrow micrometastasis and the surrounding stromal cells in men with prostate cancer.  Methods and patients:   A cross-sectional study of men with prostate cancer. Touch preps were obtained from bone marrow biopsies of men with prostate cancer, before and after radical prostatectomy and during androgen blockade. Micrometastasis detected with anti-PSA immunocytochemistry underwent processing with anti-HER-2 and anti-MMP-2 immunocytochemistry. Patients were defined as HER-2 positive or negative, MMP-2 negative or an MMP-2 pattern described as border or central and stromal MMP-2 defined as positive or negative. The expression of the biomarkers was compared before and after primary treatment and during androgen blockade in relation to the serum PSA at the time of sampling and duration of androgen blockade.  Results:   191 men participated, 35 men before surgery and 43 after surgery; there were no significant differences in HER-2 expression between groups, there was no MMP-2 expression centrally or stromal expression of MMP-2. In men with androgen blockade, HER-2 expression was significantly higher; there was a trend for increasing HER-2 expression up to 5 years; central MMP-2 expression significantly increased after 3 years, while stromal MMP-2 significantly increased after 6 years. MMP-2 expression both in micrometastasis and stroma was significantly associated with HER-2 expression. Expression of MMP-2 at the border of the micrometastasis was not associated with HER-2 expression and occurred in the absence of androgen blockade.  Conclusions:   Androgen blockade decreases serum PSA by eliminating HER-2 negative prostate cancer cells. However, there is early selection of HER-2 positive cancer cells which leads to androgen independence and to increased expression of MMP-2 activity in the micrometastasis. The increased MMP-2 activity in the micrometastasis increases the expression of MMP-2 in the surrounding stromal cells and thus could promote angiogenesis and tumor growth resulting in macrometastatic androgen independent disease.""","""['N P Murray', 'E Reyes', 'L Badinez', 'N Orellana', 'C Fuentealba', 'R Olivares', 'J Porcell', 'R Dueñas']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""ScientificWorldJournal""","""['Positive HER-2 protein expression in circulating prostate cells and micro-metastasis, resistant to androgen blockage but not diethylstilbestrol.', 'Redefining micrometastasis in prostate cancer - a comparison of circulating prostate cells, bone marrow disseminated tumor cells and micrometastasis: Implications in determining local or systemic treatment for biochemical failure after radical prostatectomy.', 'Comparison between Use of PSA Kinetics and Bone Marrow Micrometastasis to Define Local or Systemic Relapse in Men with Biochemical Failure after Radical Prostatectomy for Prostate Cancer.', 'Prostate-specific antigen-producing cells in the bone marrow of a patient with early-stage prostate cancer.', 'Early versus deferred androgen suppression in the treatment of advanced prostatic cancer.', 'The expression of matrix-metalloproteinase-2 in bone marrow micro-metastasis is associated with the presence of circulating prostate cells and a worse prognosis in men treated with radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer.']"""

Loss of PTEN and activation of PI3K/Akt is frequently observed in prostate cancer, which may potentially inactivate FoxO activity. We therefore investigated the role of FoxO transcription factors in prostate cancer progression, in particular FoxO3a, in transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate (TRAMP) mice, which mimics progressive forms of human disease.  Methods:   Prostate cancer progression in TRAMP mice was followed from 8 to 28 weeks. Expression patterns of Akt, FoxO1a, FoxO3a, FoxO4, and their phosphorylated form, DNA binding activity and downstream signaling molecules during different stages of disease progression were examined by immunoblotting, immunoprecipitation, enzyme-linked immunoabsorbant assay (ELISA), and immunohistochemistry. Inhibition of FoxO3a activity was attained by using FoxO3a peptide treatment to TRAMP mice.  Results:   In TRAMP mice, FoxO3a activity is negatively regulated by Akt/PKB through post-translational modification. Progressive increase in Akt activation during prostate cancer progression led to increase phosphorylation of FoxO3a and binding with 14-3-3, which potentially affected its transcriptional activity in age-specific manner. Furthermore, blocking FoxO3a activity resulted in accelerated prostate cancer progression in these mice, which was associated with the loss of cell cycle control and increased proliferation and survival markers.

Sodium/glucose co-transporter 1 (SGLT1) is an active glucose transporter that is overexpressed in many cancers including prostate cancer. Previously, we found that EGFR interacts with and stabilizes SGLT1 in cancer cells.  Methods:   In this study, we determined the micro-domain of EGFR that is required for its interaction with SGLT1 and the effects of activation/inactivation of EGFR on EGFR-SGLT1 interaction, measured the expression of EGFR and SGLT1 in prostate cancer tissues, and tested the effect of inhibition of SGLT1 on the sensitivity of prostate cancer cells to EGFR tyrosine inhibitors.  Results:   We found that the autophosphorylation region (978-1210 amino acids) of EGFR was required for its sufficient interaction with SGLT1 and that this interaction was independent of EGFR's tyrosine kinase activity. Most importantly, the EGFR-SGLT1 interaction does not respond to EGFR tyrosine kinase modulators (EGF and tyrosine kinase inhibitors).

Conclusion:   These data suggest that EGFR in cancer cells can exist as either a tyrosine kinase modulator responsive status or an irresponsive status.

This study aimed to determine the effect of Dkk-3 on prostate stromal remodeling that is stromal proliferation, fibroblast-to-myofibroblast differentiation and expression of angiogenic factors in vitro.  Methods:   Lentiviral-delivered overexpression and shRNA-mediated knockdown of DKK3 were applied to primary human prostatic stromal cells (PrSCs). Cellular proliferation was analyzed by BrdU incorporation ELISA. Expression of Dkk-3, apoptosis-related genes, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors and angiogenic factors were analyzed by qPCR, Western blot analysis or ELISA. Fibroblast-to-myofibroblast differentiation was monitored by smooth muscle cell actin and insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 mRNA and protein levels. The relevance of Wnt/β-catenin and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways was assessed by cytoplasmic/nuclear β-catenin levels and phosphorylation of AKT.  Results:   Knockdown of DKK3 significantly attenuated PrSC proliferation as well as fibroblast-to-myofibroblast differentiation and increased the expression of the vessel stabilizing factor angiopoietin-1. DKK3 knockdown did not affect subcellular localization or levels of β-catenin but attenuated AKT phosphorylation in PrSCs. Consistently the PI3K/AKT inhibitor LY294002 mimicked the effects of DKK3 knockdown.  Conclusions:   Dkk-3 promotes fibroblast proliferation and myofibroblast differentiation and regulates expression of angiopoietin-1 in prostatic stroma potentially via enhancing PI3K/AKT signaling. Thus, elevated Dkk-3 in the stroma of the diseased prostate presumably regulates stromal remodeling by enhancing proliferation and differentiation of stromal cells and contributing to the angiogenic switch observed in BPH and PCa. Therefore, Dkk-3 represents a potential therapeutic target for stromal remodeling in BPH and PCa.""","""['Christoph Zenzmaier', 'Natalie Sampson', 'Eugen Plas', 'Peter Berger']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Dysregulation of Dkk-3 expression in benign and malignant prostatic tissue.', 'Stromal insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 (IGFBP3) is elevated in the diseased human prostate and promotes ex vivo fibroblast-to-myofibroblast differentiation.', 'Stromally expressed c-Jun regulates proliferation of prostate epithelial cells.', 'Molecular mechanisms of prostatic oncogenesis.', 'Stromal androgen receptor roles in the development of normal prostate, benign prostate hyperplasia, and prostate cancer.', 'Mechanism of Androgen-Independent Stromal Proliferation in Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia.', ""DKK3's protective role in prostate cancer is partly due to the modulation of immune-related pathways."", 'Dickkopf-3: An Update on a Potential Regulator of the Tumor Microenvironment.', 'Vitamin D sufficiency enhances differentiation of patient-derived prostate epithelial organoids.', 'The Suppressing Effects of Dkk3 Expression on Aggressiveness and Tumorigenesis of Colorectal Cancer.']"""

Among these events, invasion of prostate cancer cells into host tissues is possible to be assessed by means of an in vitro invasion model, and is thought to be coupled to altered expression of membrane proteins. Dysregulated functions of the factors regulating organogenesis during embryogenesis are known to facilitate metastasis of many types of cancers. PAX2 (paired box 2) is a member of the PAX transcription factor family, which regulates prostatic ductal growth and branching in organogenesis of mammalian prostates. However, the role of PAX2 in prostate cancer development remains to be determined.  Methods:   PAX2 expression in human prostate cancers and normal prostate epithelium were examined by quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. Matrigel invasion assay and a gene array analysis were performed using prostate cancer cell lines transfected with either control or PAX2 siRNA.  Results:   In human prostate cancers, PAX2 was hyper-expressed in metastatic cancers, but was expressed at lower levels in non-metastatic cancers. Consistent with this, PAX2 knockdown repressed cell growth and invasion in a Matrigel invasion assay.

In combination, these agents simultaneously target the bone stroma and cancer cell to optimize antitumor effects. The toxicity and efficacy when each agent is combined at full, recommended doses, in a repetitive fashion is not well established.  Methods:   Patients with progressive mCRPC and ≥ 3 bone lesions received (153) Sm-EDTMP (samarium-153 ethylene diamine tetramethylene phosphonate) at a dose of 1.0 mCi/kg every 9 weeks and docetaxel at a dose of 75 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks. In the absence of unacceptable toxicity, patients were allowed to continue additional cycles, defined by 9 weeks of treatment, until intolerance or biochemical/radiographic disease progression.  Results:   Of the 30 patients treated, approximately 50% were considered to be taxane-naive, 36.7% were taxane-refractory, and 13.3% had previously been exposed to taxanes but were not considered refractory. Patients received on average 2.5 cycles of treatment (6.5 doses of docetaxel and 2.5 doses of (153) Sm-EDTMP). Twelve patients (40%) demonstrated a decline in their prostate-specific antigen level of ≥ 50%. The median progression-free survival (biochemical or radiographic) was 7.0 months and the overall survival was 14.3 months. Nine patients (30%) did not recover platelet counts >100 K/mm(3) after a median of 3 cycles to allow for additional treatment, with 4 patients experiencing prolonged thrombocytopenia. The most common reasons for trial discontinuation were progressive disease and hematologic toxicity.  Conclusions:   The results of the current study indicate that (153) Sm-EDTMP can be safely combined with docetaxel at full doses on an ongoing basis in patients with mCRPC.

From that point of view, the high hopes put in proteomics have not been fulfilled yet. The key reasons for that is the complexity of the proteome and the limited technologies in terms of specificity and reproducibility. Thus, major focus is put on the development of novel innovative analytical techniques in the field of life science, using high-performance single- and multidimensional separation and enrichment methods, such as solid-phase extraction (SPE), liquid chromatography (HPLC), or capillary electrophoresis (CE) coupled to mass spectrometry (MS). A newly emerged technology, termed as material-enhanced laser desorption/ionization (MELDI) meets basic requirements and is applied to reduce the complexity of proteomic samples while liquid chromatography (LC) is used for separation and fractionation, followed by identification with MS/MS including database searching analysis. Different MELDI carriers are employed as support materials to specifically bind peptides and proteins from biofluids like serum or urine. The MELDI approach supports automated routine analysis by means of liquid handling robots for high-throughput applications leading to higher reproducibility, crucial for a successful identification of disease markers with MALDI-TOF MS.

Enzalutamide inhibits multiple steps of AR signaling: binding of androgens to AR, AR nuclear translocation, and association of AR with DNA. Here, we investigate the effects of enzalutamide on AR signaling, AR-dependent gene expression and cell apoptosis.  Methods:   The expression of AR target gene prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was measured in LnCaP and C4-2 cells. AR nuclear translocation was assessed in HEK-293 cells stably transfected with AR-yellow fluorescent protein. The in vivo effects of enzalutamide were determined in a mouse xenograft model of CRPC. Differential gene expression in LNCaP cells was measured using Affymetrix human genome microarray technology.  Results:   We found that unlike bicalutamide, enzalutamide lacked AR agonistic activity at effective doses and did not induce PSA expression or AR nuclear translocation. Additionally, it is more effective than bicalutamide at inhibiting agonist-induced AR nuclear translocation. Enzalutamide induced the regression of tumor volume in a CRPC xenograft model and apoptosis in AR-over-expressing prostate cancer cells. Finally, gene expression profiling in LNCaP cells indicated that enzalutamide opposes agonist-induced changes in genes involved in processes such as cell adhesion, angiogenesis, and apoptosis.

Definitive treatment included radical prostatectomy, daily external beam radiation for 5 to 8 weeks, brachytherapy, or combination external beam radiation/brachytherapy. Adjusted definitive treatment rates were calculated by rural-urban residence overall, and for different sociodemographic and cancer characteristics, and different states based on logistic regression analyses, using general estimating equation methods to account for clustering by county.  Results:   Adjusted definitive treatment rates were lower for rural (83.7%) than urban (87.1%) patients with early-stage prostate cancer (P ≤ .01). Rural men were more likely than urban men to receive non-definitive surgical treatment and no initial treatment.

Conclusions:   Between 2004 and 2006, this adjusted analysis found that men who were living in rural areas were less likely to receive definitive treatment for their early-stage prostate cancer than those living in urban areas.

The effect of CPO on STAT3 activation, associated protein kinases and phosphatase, STAT3-regulated gene products and apoptosis was investigated using both functional proteomics tumor pathway technology platform and different tumor cell lines. We found that CPO suppressed constitutive STAT3 activation in multiple myeloma (MM), breast and prostate cancer cell lines, with a significant dose- and time-dependent effects observed in MM cells. The suppression was mediated through the inhibition of activation of upstream kinases c-Src and JAK1/2. Also, vanadate treatment reversed CPO-induced down-regulation of STAT3, suggesting the involvement of a tyrosine phosphatase. Indeed, we found that CPO induced the expression of tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 that correlated with the down-regulation of constitutive STAT3 activation. Interestingly, deletion of SHP-1 gene by siRNA abolished the ability of CPO to inhibit STAT3 activation. The inhibition of STAT3 activation by CPO inhibited proliferation, induced apoptosis and abrogated the invasive potential of tumor cells.

The molecular signature associated with stromal sarcoma and STUMP has not been unraveled. The study was conducted to detect the chromosomal imbalances in stromal sarcoma and STUMP by using array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH). The study consisted of two cases of stromal nodule, eight cases of STUMP (three degenerative atypia type, three myxoid type, one hypercellular type, and one phyllodes type), and four cases of stromal sarcoma, including a distant metastasis developed metachronously after a primary stromal sarcoma of the prostate. DNA was extracted from the representative paraffin-embedded formalin-fixed specimens and was submitted for aCGH. All stromal sarcomas and seven STUMPs revealed chromosomal aberrations. Overall, the most common alteration was loss of chromosome 13 (10 cases), followed by loss of chromosome 14 (9 cases), and loss of chromosome 10 (7 cases).

Previous CRAds used in prostate cancer (PCa) gene therapy require androgens to activate prostate-specific promoters and induce viral replication. Unfortunately, these CRAds have reduced activity in patients on androgen-suppressive therapy. We describe a novel prostate-specific CRAd generated by fusing the E1A gene to the androgen receptor (AR) cDNA with a point mutation in codon 685 (C685Y). The E1A-AR fusion neutralizes the previously described mutual inhibition of E1A and AR, and the C685Y point mutation alters specificity of steroid ligand binding to the AR, such that both androgens and nonsteroidal anti-androgens can activate viral replication. We demonstrate that the mutated E1A-AR retained the ability to function in regulating AR-responsive genes and E1A-responsive viral genes. In combination therapy of virus, bicalutamide (anti-androgen) and radiation, a profound impact on cell death by viral oncolysis was seen both in vitro and tumor xenografts.

Materials and methods:   A total of 191 consecutive patients underwent TTMB of the prostate using an anatomic-based technique with sampling of 24 regions. All patients had elevated prostate-specific antigen on routine screening which was followed by a confirmatory prostate-specific antigen and none had undergone previous biopsy of the prostate. The locations of cancer involvement were recorded for each patient in an effort to approximate the percentage of men whose cancer would have been missed or Gleason score underestimated on a standard 12-core biopsy. The median number of submitted biopsy cores was 54.0.  Results:   Of the 191 study patients, 140 (73.3%) were diagnosed with cancer on TTMB. Among these biopsy-positive patients, 124 (88.6%) had clinically significant cancer. Eighty-nine of the biopsy-positive patients (64.6%) had a Gleason score of ≥7. A total of 34 of the 140 diagnosed cancers were identified exclusively in regions that fell outside of the theoretical 12-core biopsy scheme, suggesting that 24.3% of these cancers would have gone undiagnosed in the absence of TTMB. Among the 107 cancers that would have been diagnosed using a 12-core biopsy approach, 18 (16.8%) were upgraded to a Gleason score of ≥7 with mapping biopsy.  Conclusions:   TTMB appears to provide more detailed information about prostate cancer grade and location compared with standard 12-core biopsy scheme.

Such correlation is necessary in order for one to understand the mechanisms whereby glycoprotein structure elaborates the functions of myriad proteins. The accurate comparison of glycoforms and quantification of glycosites are essential steps in this direction. Mass spectrometry has emerged as a powerful analytical technique in the field of glycoprotein characterization. Its sensitivity, high dynamic range, and mass accuracy provide both quantitative and sequence/structural information. As part of the 2012 ABRF Glycoprotein Research Group study, we explored the use of mass spectrometry and ancillary methodologies to characterize the glycoforms of two sources of human prostate specific antigen (PSA). PSA is used as a tumor marker for prostate cancer, with increasing blood levels used to distinguish between normal and cancer states. The glycans on PSA are believed to be biantennary N-linked, and it has been observed that prostate cancer tissues and cell lines contain more antennae than their benign counterparts. Thus, the ability to quantify differences in glycosylation associated with cancer has the potential to positively impact the use of PSA as a biomarker. We studied standard peptide-based proteomics/glycomics methodologies, including LC-MS/MS for peptide/glycopeptide sequencing and label-free approaches for differential quantification. We performed an interlaboratory study to determine the ability of different laboratories to correctly characterize the differences between glycoforms from two different sources using mass spectrometry methods. We used clustering analysis and ancillary statistical data treatment on the data sets submitted by participating laboratories to obtain a consensus of the glycoforms and abundances.

We assessed the incidence of emergency department visits in men with lower urinary tract symptoms who presented to emergency departments in the United States and factors associated with an increased likelihood of hospitalization.  Materials and methods:   Emergency department visits from 2006 to 2009 associated with a primary diagnosis of lower urinary tract symptoms using established criteria were abstracted from the Nationwide Emergency Department Sample. Age adjusted incidence rates of emergency department visits and charges were calculated. We performed multivariable analysis to examine patient and hospital characteristics of those hospitalized and those with benign prostatic hyperplasia related adverse events.  Results:   A weighted estimate of 1,178,423 emergency department visits for lower urinary tract symptoms was recorded with a national incidence of 197.6/100,000 males per year. A total of 112,288 visits (9.5%) resulted in hospitalization. Adverse events were identified in 734,269 patients (62.3%). The most common adverse events were catheterization in 44.6% of cases, infection in 17.4%, hematuria in 9.6%, bladder stones in 1.7%, hydronephrosis in 1.2% and acute renal failure in 0.1%. On multivariable analysis independent predictors of hospital admission included comorbidities, socioeconomic status, hospital characteristics and adverse events such as sepsis, acute renal failure and hydronephrosis. Independent predictors of adverse events included patient age, year of visit, socioeconomic status, hospital characteristics and concomitant neurological disease. In 2009 total emergency department charges for lower urinary tract symptoms were $494,981,922.  Conclusions:   The number of men with lower urinary tract symptoms who visit the emergency department has remained stable, while emergency department charges have increased by 40%.

Incidence and relative survival for invasive cancers were computed using data from the cancer registries Geneva (1970-2009), St. Gallen - Appenzell (1980-2010), Grisons & Glarus (1989-2010), and Valais (1989-2010). We estimated prevalence for 1990-2010 using the Prevalence, Incidence Approach MODel (PIAMOD) method. We calculated trends in prevalence estimates by Joinpoint analysis. Projections were extrapolated using the above models and based on time trends of the period 2007-2010.  Results:   The estimated number of cancer survivors increased from 139'717 in 1990 (2.08% of the population) to 289'797 persons in 2010 (3.70%). The growth rate shows an exponential shape and was 3.3% per year in the period 2008 to 2010. Almost half of the survivors have a history of breast, prostate or colorectal cancer. Among cancer survivors, 55% are women but the increases have been more marked in men (p < 0.01, 3.9% annual increase in men vs. 2.7% in women since 2008).

This behavior of MSCs has been exploited as a tumor-targeting strategy for cell-based cancer therapy. However, the effects of MSCs on tumor growth are controversial. This study was designed to determine the effect of MSCs on the growth of breast and prostate tumors.  Methods:   Bone marrow-derived MSCs (BM-MSCs) were isolated and characterized. Effects of BM-MSCs on tumor cell proliferation were analyzed in a co-culture system with mouse breast cancer cell 4T1 or human prostate cancer cell DU145. Tumor cells were injected into nude mice subcutaneously either alone or coupled with BM-MSCs. The expression of cell proliferation and angiogenesis-related proteins in tumor tissues were immunofluorescence analyzed. The angiogenic effect of BM-MSCs was detected using a tube formation assay. The effects of the crosstalk between tumor cells and BM-MSCs on expression of angiogenesis related markers were examined by immunofluorescence and real-time PCR.  Results:   Both co-culturing with mice BM-MSCs (mBM-MSCs) and treatment with mBM-MSC-conditioned medium enhanced the growth of 4T1 cells. Co-injection of 4T1 cells and mBM-MSCs into nude mice led to increased tumor size compared with injection of 4T1 cells alone. Similar experiments using DU145 cells and human BM-MSCs (hBM-MSCs) instead of 4T1 cells and mBM-MSCs obtained consistent results. Compared with tumors induced by injection of tumor cells alone, the blood vessel area was greater in tumors from co-injection of tumor cells with BM-MSCs, which correlated with decreased central tumor necrosis and increased tumor cell proliferation. Furthermore, both conditioned medium from hBM-MSCs alone and co-cultures of hBM-MSCs with DU145 cells were able to promote tube formation ability of human umbilical vein endothelial cells. When hBM-MSCs are exposed to the DU145 cell environment, the expression of markers associated with neovascularization (macrophage inflammatory protein-2, vascular endothelial growth factor, transforming growth factor-beta and IL-6) was increased.  Conclusion:   These results indicate that BM-MSCs promote tumor growth and suggest that the crosstalk between tumor cells and BM-MSCs increased the expression of pro-angiogenic factors, which may have induced tumor cell proliferation and angiogenesis thereby increasing solid tumor growth.""","""['Ting Zhang', 'Yuk Wai Lee', 'Yun Feng Rui', 'Tin Yan Cheng', 'Xiao Hua Jiang', 'Gang Li']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Stem Cell Res Ther""","""['Mesenchymal stromal cells promote tumor growth through the enhancement of neovascularization.', 'Intravenous Anesthetics Enhance the Ability of Human Bone Marrow-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells to Alleviate Hepatic Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury in a Receptor-Dependent Manner.', 'Human Glioblastoma-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cell to Pericytes Transition and Angiogenic Capacity in Glioblastoma Microenvironment.', 'Mesenchymal stem cell secretome and regenerative therapy after cancer.', 'Bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells for diabetes therapy: touch, fuse, and fix?', 'The Effect of Stem Cells and Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor on Cancer Angiogenesis.', 'Cranial Neural Crest Cells Contribution to Craniofacial Bone Development and Regeneration.', 'Human Bone Marrow-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cell Applications in Neurodegenerative Disease Treatment and Integrated Omics Analysis for Successful Stem Cell Therapy.', 'Fibroblasts as Turned Agents in Cancer Progression.', 'Shining the light on mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes in breast cancer.']"""

Integrating PRISM with front-end IgY14 immunoaffinity depletion, sensitive detection of targeted proteins at 50-100 pg/mL levels in human blood plasma/serum was demonstrated. However, immunoaffinity depletion is often associated with undesired losses of target proteins of interest. Herein we report further evaluation of PRISM-SRM quantification of low-abundance serum proteins without immunoaffinity depletion. Limits of quantification (LOQ) at low ng/mL levels with a median coefficient of variation (CV) of ∼12% were achieved for proteins spiked into human female serum. PRISM-SRM provided >100-fold improvement in the LOQ when compared to conventional LC-SRM measurements. PRISM-SRM was then applied to measure several low-abundance endogenous serum proteins, including prostate-specific antigen (PSA), in clinical prostate cancer patient sera. PRISM-SRM enabled confident detection of all target endogenous serum proteins except the low pg/mL-level cardiac troponin T. A correlation coefficient >0.99 was observed for PSA between the results from PRISM-SRM and immunoassays.

The bombesin antagonist analog d-Phe-Gln-Trp-Ala-Val-Gly-His-Sta-Leu-NH2 ([d-Phe(6),Sta(13),Leu(14)]bombesin[6-14]) was synthesized and conjugated to 1,4,7-triazacyclononane-N,N',N″-triacetic acid (NOTA) via a diethylene glycol (PEG2) linker. The resulting conjugate, NOTA-PEG2-[d-Phe(6),Sta(13),Leu(14)]bombesin[6-14] (NOTA-P2-RM26), was labeled with (68)Ga (T1/2 = 68 min, positron emitter) and (111)In (T1/2 = 2.8 days, gamma emitter). The labeling stability, specificity, inhibition efficiency (IC50), and dissociation constant (KD) of both labeled compounds as well as their cellular retention and internalization were investigated. The pharmacokinetics of the dual isotope ((111)In/(68)Ga)-labeled peptide in both normal NMRI mice and PC-3 tumor-bearing Balb/c nu/nu mice was also studied. NOTA-P2-RM26 was labeled with (111)In and (68)Ga at a radiochemical yield of >98%. Both conjugates were shown to have high specificity and binding affinity for GRPR. The KD value was determined to be 23 ± 13 pM for the (111)In-labeled compound in a saturation binding experiment. In addition, (nat)In- and (nat)Ga-NOTA-P2-RM26 showed low nanomolar binding inhibition concentrations (IC50 = 1.24 ± 0.29 nM and 0.91 ± 0.19 nM, respectively) in a competitive binding assay. The internalization rate of the radiolabeled conjugates was slow. The radiometal-labeled tracers demonstrated rapid blood clearance via the kidney and GRPR-specific uptake in the pancreas in normal mice. Tumor targeting and biodistribution studies in mice bearing PC-3 xenografts displayed high and specific uptake in tumors (8.1 ± 0.4%ID/g for (68)Ga and 5.7 ± 0.3%ID/g for (111)In) and high tumor-to-background ratios (tumor/blood: 12 ± 1 for (68)Ga and 10 ± 1 for (111)In) after only 1 h p.i. of 45 pmol of peptide. The xenografts were visualized by gamma and microPET cameras shortly after injection. In conclusion, the antagonistic bombesin analog NOTA-PEG2-d-Phe-Gln-Trp-Ala-Val-Gly-His-Sta-Leu-NH2 (NOTA-P2-RM26) is a promisindg candidate for prostate cancer imaging using PET and SPECT/CT.""","""['Zohreh Varasteh', 'Irina Velikyan', 'Gunnar Lindeberg', 'Jens Sörensen', 'Mats Larhed', 'Mattias Sandström', 'Ram Kumar Selvaraju', 'Jennie Malmberg', 'Vladimir Tolmachev', 'Anna Orlova']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Bioconjug Chem""","""['A new (68)Ga-labeled BBN peptide with a hydrophilic linker for GRPR-targeted tumor imaging.', 'In vitro and in vivo evaluation of a (18)F-labeled high affinity NOTA conjugated bombesin antagonist as a PET ligand for GRPR-targeted tumor imaging.', 'The effect of macrocyclic chelators on the targeting properties of the 68Ga-labeled gastrin releasing peptide receptor antagonist PEG2-RM26.', '3-Cyano-4-18Ffluoro-benzoyl-Ala(SO3H)-Ala(SO3H)-Ava-Gln-Trp-Ala-Val-NMeGly-His-Sta-Leu-NH2.', '68Ga-DOTA-4-amino-1-carboxymethyl-piperidine-D-Phe-Gln-Trp-Ala-Val-Gly-His-Sta-Leu-NH2.', 'The effects of novel macrocyclic chelates on the targeting properties of the 68Ga-labeled Gastrin releasing peptide receptor antagonist RM2.', 'Phase I Trial of 99mTcTc-maSSS-PEG2-RM26, a Bombesin Analogue Antagonistic to Gastrin-Releasing Peptide Receptors (GRPRs), for SPECT Imaging of GRPR Expression in Malignant Tumors.', 'Production, Purification, and Applications of a Potential Theranostic Pair: Cobalt-55 and Cobalt-58m.', '66Ga-PET-imaging of GRPR-expression in prostate cancer: production and characterization of 66GaGa-NOTA-PEG2-RM26.', 'Preclinical Evaluation of the Copper-64 Labeled GRPR-Antagonist RM26 in Comparison with the Cobalt-55 Labeled Counterpart for PET-Imaging of Prostate Cancer.']"""

Methods:   A total of 180 patients with clinically localized prostate cancer underwent HIFU and were retrospectively reviewed. Of those 171 patients primarily treated with HIFU were included in the analysis. They were stratified by prostatic volume, neoadjuvant hormonal ablation (NHA), and post-treatment PSA nadir. PSA level was monitored every month during the first 6 months after the treatment and every 3 months thereafter. According to the latest Phoenix criteria, biochemical failure was defined by a PSA rise of2 ng/ml or more above the PSA nadir. Seventy-six (44.4%) patients were offered preoperative NHA in median duration of 3 months (IQR: 3-5.75). Preoperative transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) was performed in 56 (32.7%) patients having the calcification within the prostatic gland.  Results:   Mean patient age was 68.3 +/- 7.0. The median follow-up time was 43 months (IQR: 30-55). According to D'amico risk groups 52 (30.4%) patients were identified with low risk, 47 (27.5%) patients with intermediate risk, and 72 (42.1%) with high risk. The overall and cancer-specific survival rates at 5 years were 98.8% and 100%. The metastasis-free survival rate at 5 years was 99.4%. No significant differences were seen in biochemical failure-free survival when stratified according to preoperative prostatic volume and administration of preoperative NHA (p = 0.931 and p = 0.712, respectively). Regardless NHA administration, patients with smaller PSA nadir (0.2 ng/ml) achieved better biochemical failure-free survival ratio.

Telomeres are maintained by telomerase complexes, of which human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) is an essential component. A functional polymorphism, -1327C>T (rs2735940), located in the promoter of the hTERT gene is associated with telomere length in peripheral blood leukocytes. We hypothesized that this polymorphism might affect susceptibility to various epithelial malignancies. The -1327C>T polymorphism was examined in 1,551 consecutive autopsy cases (mean age, 80.3 years), and we focused on its effect on the risks of overall and each primary malignancies. The polymorphism was further studied in 391 clinical prostate cancer patients who were diagnosed via prostate biopsy, using autopsy cases as controls. In the autopsy cases, the risk of epithelial malignancy, after adjusting for age, sex, smoking, and drinking habits, was significantly lower for the TT genotype than the CC (reference) genotype (adjusted odds ratio = 0.61, 95% CI = 0.42-0.90). Among primary malignancies, latent prostate cancer, colorectal cancer, and lung cancer were the most strongly associated with the polymorphism. In the study using clinical prostate cancer patients, susceptibility to clinical prostate cancer was lower for -1327 T carriers than for -1327 T non-carriers, but this finding was not significant.

The objective of this study was to determine whether or not the stromal biomarkers detected with a thioredoxin-targeted nanodevice could be used to distinguish the stroma associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia from that associated with PCA. In this regard, we recently demonstrated that a thioredoxin-targeted nanodevice selectively binds to reactive stroma in frozen prostate tumor tissue sections. To accomplish this, random frozen prostate tissue sections from each of 35 patients who underwent resection were incubated with the nanodevice and graded for fluorescent intensity. An adjacent section from each case was stained with Hematoxylin & Eosin to confirm the diagnosis. Select cases were stained with Masson's Trichrome or immunohistochemically using antibodies to thioredoxin reductase 1, thioredoxin reductase 2 or peroxiredoxin 1. Our results demonstrate that the graded intensity of nanodevice binding to the stroma associated with PCA was significantly higher (p = 0.0127) than that of benign prostatic hyperplasia using the t-test. Immunohistochemical staining of adjacent sections in representative cases showed that none of the two commonly studied thioredoxin interacting protein partners mirrored the fluorescence pattern seen with the nanodevice. However, thioredoxin reductase 2 protein was clearly shown to be a biomarker of prostate cancer-associated reactive stroma whose presence distinguishes the stroma associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia from that associated with prostate cancer. We conclude that the signal detected by the nanodevice, in contrast to individual targets detected with antibodies used in this study, originates from multiple thioredoxin interacting protein partners that distinguish the M2 neutrophil and macrophage associated inflammatory response in prostate cancer-associated stroma from the CD4+ T-Lymphocyte linked inflammation in benign prostatic hyperplasia.""","""['Elizabeth Singer', 'Jennifer Linehan', 'Gail Babilonia', 'S Ashraf Imam', 'David Smith', 'Sofia Loera', 'Timothy Wilson', 'Steven Smith']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Biomarker identification with ligand-targeted nucleoprotein assemblies.', 'Mesonephric remnant hyperplasia involving prostate and periprostatic tissue: findings at radical prostatectomy.', 'Gray level entropy matrix is a superior predictor than multiplex ELISA in the detection of reactive stroma and metastatic potential of high-grade prostatic adenocarcinoma.', 'Sarcomas and related proliferative lesions of specialized prostatic stroma: a clinicopathologic study of 22 cases.', 'Molecular mechanisms of prostatic oncogenesis.', 'Nanomedicine and cancer immunotherapy: focus on indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase inhibitors.', 'Reactive stroma component COL6A1 is upregulated in castration-resistant prostate cancer and promotes tumor growth.', 'Senescent remodeling of the innate and adaptive immune system in the elderly men with prostate cancer.']"""

We have previously demonstrated that synthetic TLR9 ligands induce invasion in TLR9-expressing prostate cancer cells in vitro. However, the role of TLR9 in the pathophysiology of prostate cancer is unclear. The expression of TLR9 in radical prostatectomy samples (n=186) was studied using immunohistochemistry. TLR9 staining scores were compared with tumor stage, Gleason score and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) concentration prior to treatment and progression-free survival. Results revealed that 124 (66.7%) of the tumors were strongly positive, 59 (31.7%) were weakly positive and 3 (1.6%) were negative, for cytoplasmic TLR9 immunostaining in cancer cells. There was no significant association between cytoplasmic TLR9 expression and distributions of pT-class, prostatectomy sample margin status, Gleason score and preoperative PSA value. Prostate cancer-specific progression-free survival was significantly longer for patients whose tumors were graded as negative for cytoplasmic TLR9 expression, as compared with patients whose tumors were strongly immunopositive for cytoplasmic TLR9 (P=0.009). In the Cox regression analysis, high TLR9 expression was an independent marker of poor prognosis in prostate cancer.

Relatively little is known about the role of Par-4 in breast cancer cell apoptosis. In this study, we sought to investigate the effects of Par-4 expression on cell proliferation, apoptosis and drug sensitivity in breast cancer cells. MCF-7 cells were stably transfected with expression vectors for Par-4, or transiently transfected with siRNA for Par-4 knockdown. Cell proliferation assays were performed using MTT and apoptosis was evaluated using acridine orange staining, fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. Par-4 overexpression reduced MCF-7 proliferation rates. Conversely, Par-4 knockdown led to increased MCF-7 proliferation. Par-4 downregulation also led to increased BCL-2 and reduced BID expression. Par-4 overexpression did not affect the cell cycle profile. However, MCF-7 cells with increased Par-4 expression showed reduced ERK phosphorylation, suggesting that the inhibition of cell proliferation promoted by Par-4 may be mediated by the MAPK/ERK1/2 pathway. MCF-7 cells with increased Par-4 expression showed a marginal increase in early apoptotic cells.

One pharmacological approach to improve patient response is to design targeted therapies that exploit the cancer milieu by reductively activating prodrugs, which results in the selective release of the free drug in the tumor tissue. Previously, we characterized prodrugs of seco-CBI-indole 2 (CBI-indole 2) designed to be activated in hypoxic tumor microenvironments, wherein the tumor maintains higher concentrations of ""reducing"" nucleophiles capable of preferentially releasing the free drug by nucleophilic attack on a weak N-O bond. Of these prodrugs, BocNHO-CBI-indole 2 (BocNHO) surpassed the efficacy of the free drug, CBI-indole 2, when examined in vivo in the murine L1210 leukemia model and demonstrated reduced toxicity suggesting a targeted or sustained release in vivo. Herein, we further examine the biological activity of the BocNHO prodrug in murine breast cancer, as well as human prostate and lung cancer cell lines, in vitro. Notably, BocNHO manifests potent antiproliferative and cytotoxic activity in all three tumor cell lines. However, in comparison to the activity observed in the murine cancer cell line, the human cancer cell lines were less sensitive, especially at early timepoints for cytotoxicity. Based on these findings, BocNHO was tested in a more clinically relevant orthotopic lung tumor model, revealing significant efficacy and reduced toxicity compared with the free drug.

Design, setting, and participants:   We used the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results-Medicare linked database from 1994 to 2007 for patients diagnosed with localized prostate cancer (PCa). We used cancer stage and Gleason score to stratify patients into low and intermediate-high risks.  Intervention:   Radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy.

Objective:   To assess data on PCa-specific mortality in the Rotterdam section of the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) trial.  Design, setting, and participants:   A randomized controlled trial with randomization after signed, written informed consent (efficacy trial). In the period 1993-1999, a total of 42 376 men aged 54-74 yr were randomized to a screening arm (S-arm) (n = 21 210 with screening every 4 yr, applying a total prostate-specific antigen [PSA] level cut-off ≥ 3.0 ng/ml as biopsy indication) or a control arm (C-arm) (n = 21 166; no intervention).  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Number of PCas detected per arm depicted by predefined time periods and prognostic groups. PCa-specific mortality analyses using Poisson regression in age group 55-74 yr at randomization and separately in the predefined age group of 55-69 yr.  Results and limitations:   After a median follow-up of 12.8 yr, 19 765 men (94.2%) were screened at least once and 2674 PCas were detected (of which 561 [21.0%] were interval PCas). In the C-arm, 1430 PCas were detected, resulting in an excess incidence of 59 PCas per 1000 men randomized (61 PCas per 1000 in age group 55-69 yr). Thirty-two percent of all men randomized have died. PCa-specific mortality relative-risk (RR) reductions of 20.0% overall (age: 55-74 yr; p = 0.042) and 31.6% (age: 55-69 yr; p = 0.004) were found. A 14.1% increase was found in men aged 70-74 yr (not statistically significant). Absolute PCa mortality was 1.8 per 1000 men randomized (2.6 per 1000 men randomized in age group 55-69 yr). The number needed to invite and number needed to manage were 565 and 33, respectively, for age group 55-74 yr, and 392 and 24, respectively, for age group 65-69 yr. Given the slow natural history of the disease, follow-up might be too short.  Conclusions:   Systematic PSA-based screening reduced PCa-specific mortality by 32% in the age range of 55-69 yr. The roughly twofold higher incidence in the S-arm underlines the importance of tools to better identify those men who would benefit from screening.""","""['Monique J Roobol', 'Ries Kranse', 'Chris H Bangma', 'Arno G J L H van Leenders', 'Bert G Blijenberg', 'Ron H N van Schaik', 'Wim J Kirkels', 'Suzie J Otto', 'Theo H van der Kwast', 'Harry J de Koning', 'Fritz H Schröder;ERSPC Rotterdam Study Group']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Screening for prostate cancer: can we learn from the mistakes of the breast screening experience?', 'Reply from authors re: Michael Baum.

Fluorescent nuclear track detectors (FNTDs) based on Al₂O₃:C,Mg single crystals combined with confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) provide 3D information on ion tracks with a resolution limited by light diffraction. Here we report the development of next generation cell-fluorescent ion track hybrid detectors (Cell-Fit-HD).  Methods:   The biocompatibility of FNTDs was tested using six different cell lines, i.e. human non-small cell lung carcinoma (A549), glioblastoma (U87), androgen independent prostate cancer (PC3), epidermoid cancer (A431) and murine (VmDk) glioma SMA-560. To evaluate cell adherence, viability and conformal coverage of the crystals different seeding densities and alternative coating with extracellular matrix (fibronectin) was tested. Carbon irradiation was performed in Bragg peak (initial 270.55 MeV u⁻¹). A series of cell compartment specific fluorescence stains including nuclear (HOECHST), membrane (Glut-1), cytoplasm (Calcein AM, CM-DiI) were tested on Cell-Fit-HDs and a single CLSM was employed to co-detect the physical (crystal) as well as the biological (cell layer) information.  Results:   The FNTD provides a biocompatible surface. Among the cells tested, A549 cells formed the most uniform, viable, tightly packed epithelial like monolayer. The ion track information was not compromised in Cell-Fit-HD as compared to the FNTD alone. Neither cell coating and culturing, nor additional staining procedures affected the properties of the FNTD surface to detect ion tracks. Standard immunofluorescence and live staining procedures could be employed to co-register cell biology and ion track information.  Conclusions:   The Cell-Fit-Hybrid Detector system is a promising platform for a multitude of studies linking biological response to energy deposition at high level of optical microscopy resolution.""","""['Martin Niklas', 'Steffen Greilich', 'Claudius Melzig', 'Mark S Akselrod', 'Jürgen Debus', 'Oliver Jäkel', 'Amir Abdollahi']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Radiat Oncol""","""['Ion track reconstruction in 3D using alumina-based fluorescent nuclear track detectors.', 'Subcellular spatial correlation of particle traversal and biological response in clinical ion beams.', 'Registration procedure for spatial correlation of physical energy deposition of particle irradiation and cellular response utilizing cell-fluorescent ion track hybrid detectors.', 'Nanoscale measurements of proton tracks using fluorescent nuclear track detectors.', 'Fluence-based dosimetry of proton and heavier ion beams using single track detectors.', 'Biosensor Cell-Fit-HD4D for correlation of single-cell fate and microscale energy deposition in complex ion beams.', 'Biosensor for deconvolution of individual cell fate in response to ion beam irradiation.', 'Charged Particle and Conventional Radiotherapy: Current Implications as Partner for Immunotherapy.', 'Oncogene addiction and radiation oncology: effect of radiotherapy with photons and carbon ions in ALK-EML4 translocated NSCLC.', 'Next generation multi-scale biophysical characterization of high precision cancer particle radiotherapy using clinical proton, helium-, carbon- and oxygen ion beams.']"""

Here we analyzed a French cohort of 103 prostate cancer patients and developed a gene panel model predictive of outcome in this group of patients. The model comprised of a 15-gene TaqMan Low-Density Array (TLDA) card, with gene expressions compared to a standardized reference. The RQ value for each gene was calculated, and a scoring system was developed. Summing all the binary scores (0 or 1) corresponding to the 15 genes, a global score is obtained between 0 and 15. This global score can be compared to Gleason score (0 to 10) by recalculating it into a 0-10 scaled score. A scaled score ≥2 suggested that the patient is suffering from a prostate cancer, and a scaled score ≥7 flagged aggressive cancer. Statistical analyses demonstrated a strongly significant linear correlation (p=3.50E-08) between scaled score and Gleason score for this prostate cancer cohort (N=103). These results support the capacity of this designed 15 target gene TLDA card approach to predict outcome in prostate cancer, opening up a new avenue for personalized medicine through future independent replication and applications for rapid identification of aggressive prostate cancer phenotypes for early intervention.""","""['Nadège Rabiau', 'Yann Dantal', 'Laurent Guy', 'Marjolaine Ngollo', 'Aslihan Dagdemir', 'Jean-Louis Kemeny', 'Benoît Terris', 'Annick Vieillefond', 'Jean-Paul Boiteux', 'Yves-Jean Bignon', 'Dominique Bernard-Gallon']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""OMICS""","""['Correlation of a Commercial Genomic Risk Classifier with Histological Patterns in Prostate Cancer.', 'Immunohistochemical expression of Ets-related gene-transcriptional factor in adenocarcinoma prostate and its correlation with Gleason score.', 'Use of two gene panels for prostate cancer diagnosis and patient risk stratification.', 'Validation of a 10-gene molecular signature for predicting biochemical recurrence and clinical metastasis in localized prostate cancer.', 'Radiomics Features Measured with Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging Predict Prostate Cancer Aggressiveness.', 'Trends in Gene Expression Profiling for Prostate Cancer Risk Assessment: A Systematic Review.', 'The association between histone 3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) and prostate cancer: relationship with clinicopathological parameters.']"""

To explore whether race-based health disparities exist among men with very low-risk PCa, we evaluated oncologic outcomes of AA men with very low-risk PCa who were candidates for AS but elected to undergo radical prostatectomy (RP).  Patients and methods:   We studied 1,801 men (256 AA, 1,473 white men, and 72 others) who met National Comprehensive Cancer Network criteria for very low-risk PCa and underwent RP. Presenting characteristics, pathologic data, and cancer recurrence were compared among the groups. Multivariable modeling was performed to assess the association of race with upgrading and adverse pathologic features.  Results:   AA men with very low-risk PCa had more adverse pathologic features at RP and poorer oncologic outcomes. AA men were more likely to experience disease upgrading at prostatectomy (27.3% v 14.4%; P < .001), positive surgical margins (9.8% v 5.9%; P = .02), and higher Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment Post-Surgical scoring system (CAPRA-S) scores. On multivariable analysis, AA race was an independent predictor of adverse pathologic features (odds ratio, [OR], 3.23; P = .03) and pathologic upgrading (OR, 2.26; P = .03).  Conclusion:   AA men with very low-risk PCa who meet criteria for AS but undergo immediate surgery experience significantly higher rates of upgrading and adverse pathology than do white men and men of other races. AA men with very low-risk PCa should be counseled about increased oncologic risk when deciding among their disease management options.""","""['Debasish Sundi', 'Ashley E Ross', 'Elizabeth B Humphreys', 'Misop Han', 'Alan W Partin', 'H Ballentine Carter', 'Edward M Schaeffer']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Clin Oncol""","""['Urological cancer: Poorer prostate cancer outcomes in African American men.', 'Re-examining racial disparities in prostate cancer outcomes.', 'Words of wisdom.

Potential mechanisms include insulin and related proteins. We investigate whether a short-term caloric restriction diet in overweight/obese men with newly diagnosed PCa can lead to measurable changes in patient anthropometrics and insulin-related proteins.  Methods:   Overweight and obese PCa patients choosing active surveillance or radical prostatectomy were randomized to a 6-week, caloric-restricted diet or to continue their current diet. Changes from baseline to end of study in anthropometrics, dietary constituents and serum proteins (insulin, c-peptide, IGF-1, adiponectin, IGF-BP3) were compared between the intervention and control groups using a Generalized Estimating Equation model.  Results:   Nineteen patients were randomized to the intervention (N = 10) or control (N = 9) group. Men in the intervention group had a 1.7% (3.7 lbs) mean decline in weight versus 1.0% (2.0 lbs) in controls (P < 0.05), and a reduced intake of calories, total and saturated fat, protein and starch (all P < 0.1 compared to controls). There was a significant difference (P = 0.002) in mean serum IGFBP-3 between the intervention (+2.8%) and control group (-6.9%). Other biomarkers changed with the diet intervention to a degree similar to previous weight loss studies but were not statistically significant compared with controls.  Conclusion:   In this small pilot study, a 6-week caloric restricted diet in men with newly diagnosed PCa produced changes in weight, diet and serum proteins possibly related to prognosis. These results support larger-scale trials testing longer-term weight loss effects on potential PCa progression biomarkers.""","""['Jonathan L Wright', 'Stephen Plymate', ""Andrea D'Oria-Cameron"", 'Carolyn Bain', 'Kathy Haugk', 'Liren Xiao', 'Daniel W Lin', 'Janet L Stanford', 'Anne McTiernan']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Phase II prospective randomized trial of weight loss prior to radical prostatectomy.', 'Feasibility outcomes of a presurgical randomized controlled trial exploring the impact of caloric restriction and increased physical activity versus a wait-list control on tumor characteristics and circulating biomarkers in men electing prostatectomy for prostate cancer.', 'Effects of a caloric restriction weight loss diet and exercise on inflammatory biomarkers in overweight/obese postmenopausal women: a randomized controlled trial.', 'Weight loss interventions for chronic asthma.', 'WITHDRAWN: Advice on low-fat diets for obesity.', 'Construction and validation of a clinical predictive nomogram for intraductal carcinoma of the prostate based on Chinese multicenter clinical data.', 'Role of adipocyte browning in prostate and breast tumor microenvironment.', 'Optimising weight-loss interventions in cancer patients-A systematic review and network meta-analysis.', 'Feasibility of a Weight Management Program Tailored for Overweight Men with Localized Prostate Cancer - A Pilot Study.', 'Dietary Factors and Supplements Influencing Prostate Specific-Antigen (PSA) Concentrations in Men with Prostate Cancer and Increased Cancer Risk: An Evidence Analysis Review Based on Randomized Controlled Trials.']"""

However, the merits of taxanes remain modest, and efforts are needed to improve their therapeutic efficacy.  Methods:   We evaluated the sensitivity of prostate cancer cells to various agents using cytotoxicity assays. Gene and protein expression levels were evaluated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting analysis, respectively.  Results:   Hydrogen peroxide-resistant and castration-resistant cells that overexpressed Twist1 and Y-box binding protein-1 (YB-1) were cross-resistant to cytotoxic agents, including docetaxel. Twist1 regulated YB-1 expression in prostate cancer cells, supported by the induction of Twist1 and YB-1 by transforming-growth factor-β, which is critical for taxane resistance. Twist1 and/or YB-1 were activated in docetaxel-resistant prostate cancer cells, and YB-1 was activated by docetaxel treatment. Conversely, Twist1 and YB-1 knockdown sensitized prostate cancer cells to cytotoxic agents, including docetaxel. In addition, androgen receptor (AR) knockdown increased cellular sensitivity to docetaxel, though AR expression in docetaxel-resistant LNCaP cells was paradoxically lower than in parental cells. Intriguingly, androgen deprivation treatment was more effective in docetaxel-resistant LNCaP cells compared with parental cells.  Conclusions:   Twist1/YB-1 and AR signaling promote docetaxel resistance in CRPC cells. However, docetaxel-resistant cells were collaterally sensitive to androgen deprivation because of down-regulation of AR expression, suggesting that the therapeutic effect of initial taxane treatment in hormone-naïve prostate cancer may be superior to that of salvage taxane treatment in CRPC.""","""['Masaki Shiota', 'Eiji Kashiwagi', 'Akira Yokomizo', 'Ario Takeuchi', 'Takashi Dejima', 'Yoohyun Song', 'Katsunori Tatsugami', 'Junichi Inokuchi', 'Takeshi Uchiumi', 'Seiji Naito']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Castration resistance of prostate cancer cells caused by castration-induced oxidative stress through Twist1 and androgen receptor overexpression.', 'Targeting ribosomal S6 kinases/Y-box binding protein-1 signaling improves cellular sensitivity to taxane in prostate cancer.', 'Y-box binding protein-1 promotes castration-resistant prostate cancer growth via androgen receptor expression.', 'Exploitation of the Androgen Receptor to Overcome Taxane Resistance in Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'Targeting continued androgen receptor signaling in prostate cancer.', 'A comprehensive review of the functions of YB-1 in cancer stemness, metastasis and drug resistance.', 'Mechanisms of tRNA-derived fragments and tRNA halves in cancer treatment resistance.', 'Prognostic value of testosterone for the castration-resistant prostate cancer patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Cellular rewiring in lethal prostate cancer: the architect of drug resistance.', 'New Zampanolide Mimics: Design, Synthesis, and Antiproliferative Evaluation.']"""

Somatic missense mutations in the plexinB1 gene coupled with overexpression of the protein frequently occur in prostate tumors, indicating a role for plexinB1 in the pathogenesis of prostate cancer. However, the effect of semaphorin/plexin signaling is highly context dependent and whether plexinB1 acts as an inducer or inhibitor of prostate tumor progression in this context is not known.  Methods:   The response of prostate cancer cell lines to plexinB1 activation was assessed in migration, invasion, proliferation and protein phosphorylation assays. Expression was assessed by quantitative RTPCR and immunoblotting.  Results:   Different prostate cancer cell lines respond to Sema4D (the ligand for plexinB1) in diverse ways. Activation of endogenous plexinB1 enhances migration, invasion and anchorage-independent growth of LNCaP prostate cancer cells via activation of ErbB2 and Akt. In contrast, Sema4D-stimulation decreased the motility and proliferative capacity of PC3 cells. LNCaP has a missense mutation (Thr1697Ala) in the plexinB1 gene while LNCaP-LN3, a derivative of LNCaP, expresses high levels of wild-type plexinB1 only. Sema4D stimulation increases the motility and anchorage independent growth of both cell lines, showing that these responses are not dependent on the presence of the Thr1697Ala form of plexinB1. ErbB2 and plexinB1 are expressed in primary prostate epithelial cells.  Conclusions:   PlexinB1 signals via ErbB2 to increase the invasive phenotype of prostate cancer cells.

Methods:   To test these assumptions, serum total testosterone (TT) and free testosterone (FT) were determined longitudinally in groups (n > 20) of intact versus castrated adult male nude, NOG, and immune competent C57BL/6 mice.  Results:   In adult male mice, TT and FT varies by 30- to 100-fold within the same animal providing a microenvironment that is only equivalent to hypogonadal, not eugonadal, adult human males (TT is 1.7 ± 1.2 ng/ml [5.8 ± 4.1 nM] in nude and 2.5 ± 1.3 ng/ml [8.7 ± 4.4 nM] in NOG mice versus >4.2 ng/ml [14.7 nM] in eugonadal humans). This was confirmed based upon enhanced growth of androgen dependent human prostate cancer xenografts inoculated into mice supplemented with exogenous testosterone to elevate and chronically maintain serum TT at a level (5 ng/ml [18 nM]) equivalent to a 50-year-old eugonadal human male. In castrated mice, TT and FT range from 2 to 20 pg/ml (7-70 pM) and <0.8 pg/ml (<2.6 pM), respectively, which is equivalent to castrate resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) patients treated with abiraterone. This was confirmed based upon the inability of another CYP17A1 inhibitor, ketoconazole, to inhibit the growth of CRPC xenografts in castrated mice.

Entosis, which is a newly found homogeneous cell-in-cell phenomenon and a non-apoptosis cell death progress, has unclear function in prostate cancer progression. Here, we dissected mechanism of AR signaling related to entosis incidence in PCa progression.  Methods:   Two stable PCa cell lines, named LNCaP-ARsi and C4-2-ARsi were established with stably transfected AR-shRNA to knockdown AR mRNA expression in LNCaP and C4-2 cells, respectively. PC3-AR9 cell line was also established after stably transfecting full-length AR-cDNA into PC3 cells. All these cells were cultured in poly-HEME-coated plates to induce entosis, which is demonstrated via double staining.  Results:   Androgen-DHT could enhance entosis in LNCaP, C4-2 and PC3-AR9 PCa cells in a dose dependent manner. Knock-down of AR in LNCaP and C4-2 significantly suppressed entosis as compared to LNCaP-ARsc and C4-2-ARsc cells at both 1 and 10 nM DHT condition (P < 0.05). And suppression of Rho/ROCK expression resulted in interruption of AR-mediated entosis. Human PCa samples surveys demonstrated that entosis was found only in CRPC but not in BPH and ADPC where AR was less expressed as compared to CRPC.  Conclusions:   These results indicated that AR might play a negative role during PCa progression via influencing entosis by modulating Rho/ROCK pathway. This newly identified AR role of enhancing entosis might help us to better understand the multiple and opposite roles of AR, which could either promote or suppress PCa cell progression via different mechanisms.""","""['Simeng Wen', 'Zhiqun Shang', 'Shimiao Zhu', 'Chawnshang Chang', 'Yuanjie Niu']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Erratum.', 'Androgen receptor (AR) positive vs negative roles in prostate cancer cell deaths including apoptosis, anoikis, entosis, necrosis and autophagic cell death.', 'Changes in androgen receptor nongenotropic signaling correlate with transition of LNCaP cells to androgen independence.', 'Identification of novel androgen receptor target genes in prostate cancer.', 'Interruption of nuclear factor kappaB signaling by the androgen receptor facilitates 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbolacetate-induced apoptosis in androgen-sensitive prostate cancer LNCaP cells.', 'Entosis: Cell-in-Cell Formation that Kills Through Entotic Cell Death.', '3D-printing magnesium-polycaprolactone loaded with melatonin inhibits the development of osteosarcoma by regulating cell-in-cell structures.', 'Entosis is induced by ultraviolet radiation.', 'Mechanical tumor microenvironment and transduction: cytoskeleton mediates cancer cell invasion and metastasis.', 'Up regulation of Rho-associated coiled-coil containing kinase1 (ROCK1) is associated with genetic instability and poor prognosis in prostate cancer.', 'The molecular machinery of regulated cell death.']"""

The role of LCN2 in prostate-cancer cell migration and invasion was analyzed by cell-migration assay and Matrigel invasion assay. The effect of LCN2 knockdown on prostate tumor growth was assessed in a subcutaneous xenograft model.  Results:   LCN2 protein and mRNA expression are higher in PC3 and DU145 cells than in LNCaP and 22Rv cells, and prostate cancer tissue correlated significantly with tumor differentiation (P < 0.017) and Gleason's grade (P < 0.02). LCN2 knockdown in PC3 and DU145 cells decreased cell proliferation, colony formation, cell cycle arrest, migration, and invasion. Conversely, LCN2 overexpression in 22Rv cells produced the opposite effect. Subcutaneous xenografts in mice models showed decreased tumor growth in the LCN2-knockdown mice.

Identification of new molecular mechanisms that regulate PCa initiation and progression would provide targets for the development of new cancer treatments. The Foxm1 transcription factor is highly up-regulated in tumor cells, inflammatory cells, and cells of tumor microenvironment. However, its functions in different cell populations of PCa lesions are unknown. To determine the role of Foxm1 in tumor cells during PCa development, we generated two novel transgenic mouse models, one exhibiting Foxm1 gain-of-function and one exhibiting Foxm1 loss-of-function under control of the prostate epithelial-specific Probasin promoter. In the transgenic adenocarcinoma mouse prostate (TRAMP) model of PCa that uses SV40 large T antigen to induce PCa, loss of Foxm1 decreased tumor growth and metastasis. Decreased prostate tumorigenesis was associated with a decrease in tumor cell proliferation and the down-regulation of genes critical for cell proliferation and tumor metastasis, including Cdc25b, Cyclin B1, Plk-1, Lox, and Versican. In addition, tumor-associated angiogenesis was decreased, coinciding with reduced Vegf-A expression. The mRNA and protein levels of 11β-Hsd2, an enzyme playing an important role in tumor cell proliferation, were down-regulated in Foxm1-deficient PCa tumors in vivo and in Foxm1-depleted TRAMP C2 cells in vitro. Foxm1 bound to, and increased transcriptional activity of, the mouse 11β-Hsd2 promoter through the -892/-879 region, indicating that 11β-Hsd2 was a direct transcriptional target of Foxm1. Without TRAMP, overexpression of Foxm1 either alone or in combination with inhibition of a p19(ARF) tumor suppressor caused a robust epithelial hyperplasia, but was insufficient to induce progression from hyperplasia to PCa. Foxm1 expression in prostate epithelial cells is critical for prostate carcinogenesis, suggesting that inhibition of Foxm1 is a promising therapeutic approach for prostate cancer chemotherapy.""","""['Yuqi Cai', 'David Balli', 'Vladimir Ustiyan', 'Logan Fulford', 'Andrea Hiller', 'Vinko Misetic', 'Yufang Zhang', 'Andrew M Paluch', 'Susan E Waltz', 'Susan Kasper', 'Tanya V Kalin']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Biol Chem""","""['SPDEF inhibits prostate carcinogenesis by disrupting a positive feedback loop in regulation of the Foxm1 oncogene.', 'Increased levels of the FoxM1 transcription factor accelerate development and progression of prostate carcinomas in both TRAMP and LADY transgenic mice.', 'FOXM1 promotes the progression of prostate cancer by regulating PSA gene transcription.', 'FOXM1 (Forkhead box M1) in tumorigenesis: overexpression in human cancer, implication in tumorigenesis, oncogenic functions, tumor-suppressive properties, and target of anticancer therapy.', 'FOX(M1) news--it is cancer.', 'The Role of Polo-Like Kinase 1 in Regulating the Forkhead Box Family Transcription Factors.', 'FOXM1: A small fox that makes more tracks for cancer progression and metastasis.', 'Improving anti-tumor efficacy of low-dose Vincristine in rhabdomyosarcoma via the combination therapy with FOXM1 inhibitor RCM1.', 'Artemisinin Mediates Its Tumor-Suppressive Activity in Hepatocellular Carcinoma Through Targeted Inhibition of FoxM1.', 'Niclosamide exerts anticancer effects through inhibition of the FOXM1-mediated DNA damage response in prostate cancer.']"""

Serum values were measured for the following analytes: prostate-specific antigen (PSA), alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), cancer antigen 125 (CA125), carbohydrate antigen 15-3 (CA15-3), carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9), and cytokeratin 19 fragment (CYFRA 21-1). For the determination of CEA, AFP, and PSA, an automatic analyzer based on chemiluminescence was applied as reference method. To assess CYFRA 21-1, CA125, CA19-9, and CA15-3, an immunoradiometric manual system was employed. Method comparison by Passing-Bablok analysis resulted in slopes ranging from 0.9728 to 1.9089 and correlation coefficients from 0.9977 to 0.9335. The precision of each assay was assessed by testing six serum samples. Each sample was analyzed for all tumor biomarkers in duplicate and in three different runs. The coefficients of variation were less than 6.3 and 6.2 % for within-run and between-run variation, respectively. Our data suggest an overall good interassay agreement for all markers. The comparison with our reference methods showed good precision and reliability, highlighting its usefulness in clinical laboratory's routine.""","""['Renato Falzarano', 'Valentina Viggiani', 'Simona Michienzi', 'Flavia Longo', 'Silvestra Tudini', 'Luigi Frati', 'Emanuela Anastasi']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Tumour Biol""","""['The reference intervals for CA125, CA15-3, CA19-9, CA72-4, AFP, CEA, NSE and CYFRA21-1.', 'Evaluation of Lumipulse® G1200 for the measurement of six tumor markers: Comparison with AIA® 2000.', 'Comparison of LUMIPULSE(®) G1200 With Kryptor and Modular E170 for the Measurement of Seven Tumor Markers.', 'A novel immunoassay for the quantization of CYFRA 21-1 in human serum.', 'Serum cytokeratin fragment 21.1 (CYFRA 21.1) as tumour marker for breast cancer: comparison with carbohydrate antigen 15.3 (CA 15.3) and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA).', 'Diagnostic impact of CEA and CA 15-3 on chemotherapy monitoring of breast cancer patients.', 'Significance of serum carcinoembryonic antigen in metastatic breast cancer patients: A prospective study.', 'On-Site Detection of Carcinoembryonic Antigen in Human Serum.', 'Comparison of Four Automated Carcinoembryonic Antigen Immunoassays: ADVIA Centaur XP, ARCHITECT I2000sr, Elecsys E170, and Unicel Dxi800.', 'Serum CA125 is a predictive marker for breast cancer outcomes and correlates with molecular subtypes.']"""

Methods:   89 consecutive RALP cases and 105 recent ORP cases were enrolled. POIs were categorized according to CDC guideline criteria. Laboratory data relating to infection such as serum white blood cells (WBC) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were comparatively investigated before and after the surgeries.

The synthetic peptides inhibited the proliferation of prostate cancer cell lines, including PC-3 and DU-145 cells. Further investigations indicated that 8b-13 arrested the cell cycle at the G0/G1 phase, reduced the activation of the Erk1/2, P38, and Akt cascades, and down-regulated the expression of G1/S-specific cyclinD1. The suppression of DNA synthesis and the G1 to S phase transition due to the expression of proteins related to proliferation and cell cycle progression may contribute to the inhibitory effect of 8b-13 peptides on cellular proliferation.

ETV1 activity is highly regulated by phosphorylation, but the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Here we report that all 14-3-3 proteins, with the exception of the tumor suppressor 14-3-3σ, can bind to ETV1 in a condition manner dictated by its prominent phosphorylation site S216. Non-σ 14-3-3 proteins synergized with ETV1 to activate transcription of its target genes MMP-1 and MMP-7, which regulate extracellular matrix in the prostate tumor microenvironment. S216 mutation or 14-3-3τ downregulation was sufficient to reduce ETV1 protein levels in prostate cancer cells, indicating that non-σ 14-3-3 proteins protect ETV1 from degradation. Notably, S216 mutation also decreased ETV1-dependent migration and invasion in benign prostate cells. Downregulation of 14-3-3τ reduced prostate cancer cell invasion and growth in the same manner as ETV1 attenuation. Finally, we showed that 14-3-3τ and 14-3-3ε were overexpressed in human prostate tumors.

Because benign and malignant vascular endothelia retain the ERG expression, ERG is considered a useful marker for angiosarcomas and related tumors. ERG is also expressed in a subset of prostate carcinomas and Ewing sarcomas due to ERG-involved translocations; therefore, this marker is also of high interest in the study of these malignancies. In this study, we evaluated 109 epithelioid sarcomas for ERG expression, on the basis of an initial observation of an ERG-positive case. We also studied expression of other endothelial antigens in epithelioid sarcoma. ERG was expressed in 38% of epithelioid sarcomas (41/109), usually with a uniform nuclear staining, similar to that seen in angiosarcomas. However, all epithelioid sarcomas were negative for ERG gene rearrangement indicating that ERG expression is not likely related to ERG-involving translocations in epithelioid sarcoma. Other endothelial markers, CD31, claudin 5, and Prox1, were absent in epithelioid sarcomas. The only exception was a pulmonary metastasis of epithelioid sarcoma showing focal CD31 expression, which probably resulted from antigen adsorption onto tumor cell surfaces. However, podoplanin was commonly (7/9) expressed in epithelioid sarcoma; therefore, this marker is not useful in distinguishing epithelioid sarcoma from angiosarcoma. INI1/SMARCB1 gene product was absent in all epithelioid sarcomas (considered here a definitional feature) but was absent from only 1 epithelioid angiosarcoma, indicating its relative specificity for epithelioid sarcoma in this differential diagnostic setting. ERG expression is fairly common in epithelioid sarcoma and should be recognized as a diagnostic pitfall in the differential diagnosis of epithelioid sarcoma and epithelioid angiosarcoma. General lack of endothelial cell-specific markers in epithelioid sarcoma helps in this distinction.""","""['Markku Miettinen', 'Zengfeng Wang', 'Maarit Sarlomo-Rikala', 'Ziedulla Abdullaev', 'Svetlana D Pack', 'John F Fetsch']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Am J Surg Pathol""","""['ERG and SALL4 expressions in SMARCB1/INI1-deficient tumors: a useful tool for distinguishing epithelioid sarcoma from malignant rhabdoid tumor.', 'Effectiveness of Vascular Markers (Immunohistochemical Stains) in Soft Tissue Sarcomas.', 'ERG and FLI1 protein expression in epithelioid sarcoma.', 'Angiosarcoma arising in association with vascular Dacron grafts and orthopedic joint prostheses: clinicopathologic, immunohistochemical, and molecular study.', 'Persistent hemoptysis secondary to extensive epithelioid angiosarcoma.', 'The Recent Advances in Molecular Diagnosis of Soft Tissue Tumors.', 'Clinicopathological Characteristics, Treatment, and Survival in Patients Diagnosed With Proximal-Type Epithelioid Sarcoma: A Case Report and Systematic Review.', 'Beyond SMARCB1 Loss: Recent Insights into the Pathobiology of Epithelioid Sarcoma.', 'Angiosarcoma of the breast, the unknown-a review of the current literature.', 'Epithelioid Sarcoma of the External Auditory Canal: An Uncommon Tumor at an Unusual Site and a Brief Overview of the Literature.']"""

Early single centre prospective development studies using high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) have demonstrated encouraging genitourinary functional preservation and short-term cancer control. Large multi-centre trials are required to evaluate medium-term cancer control and reproduce functional recovery. We describe the study design of an investigator-led UK multi-centre, single arm trial using HIFU to deliver focal therapy for men with localised prostate cancer.  Methods:   One-hundred and forty men with histologically proven localised low or intermediate risk prostate cancer (PSA < 15, Gleason ≤ 7, ≤ T2cN0M0) will undergo precise characterisation of the prostate using a combination of multi-parametric (mp)MRI and transperineal template prostate mapping (TPM) biopsies. Unilateral dominant tumours, the so-called index lesion, will be eligible for treatment provided the contra-lateral side is free of 'clinically significant' disease (as defined by Gleason ≥ 7 or maximum cancer core length ≥4 mm). Patients will receive focal therapy using HIFU (Sonablate 500®). Treatment effect will be assessed by targeted biopsies of the treated area and TPM biopsies at 36-months.  Results:   Primary outcome is the absence of clinically significant disease based on 36-month post-treatment TPM biopsies. Secondary outcomes address a) genitourinary function using validated patient questionnaires (IPSS, IPSS-QoL, IIEF-15, EPIC-Urinary, EPIC-Bowel, FACT-P, EQ-5D), b) the predictive validity of imaging, and c) risk factors for treatment failure.

Materials and methods:   The US Census Bureau Current Population Survey, Small Area Health Insurance Estimates (2000) were used for the rates of uninsurance. Counties were divided into tertiles according to the uninsurance rates. The data were compared with the cancer incidence and survival for patients residing in counties captured by the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database (2000-2006). Aggregate patient data were collected of US adults (aged ≥18 y) diagnosed with the following cancers: pancreatic, esophageal, liver or bile duct, lung or bronchial, ovarian, colorectal, breast, prostate, melanoma, and thyroid. The outcomes included the stage at diagnosis, surgery, and survival. Univariate tests and proportional hazards were calculated.  Results:   The US uninsurance rate was 14.2%, and the range for the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results counties was 8.3%-24.1%. Overall, patients from lower uninsurance rate counties demonstrated longer median survival. Adjusting for patient characteristics and cancer stage (for each cancer), the patients in the higher uninsurance rate counties demonstrated greater mortality (8%-15% increased risk on proportional hazards). The county uninsurance rate was associated with the stage at diagnosis for all cancers, except pancreatic and esophageal, and was also associated with the likelihood of being recommended for cancer-directed surgery (for all cancers).  Conclusions:   Health insurance coverage at a community level appears to influence survival for patients with cancer. Additional investigations are needed to examine whether individual versus community associations exist and how best to surmount barriers to cancer care.""","""['Jillian K Smith', 'Sing Chau Ng', 'Zheng Zhou', 'James E Carroll', 'Theodore P McDade', 'Shimul A Shah', 'Jennifer F Tseng']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Surg Res""","""['The association of insurance and stage at diagnosis among patients aged 55 to 74 years in the national cancer database.', 'Spillover effects of community uninsurance on awareness, treatment, and control of hypertension among insured adults.', 'Association of insurance with cancer care utilization and outcomes.', 'Monitoring the consequences of uninsurance: a review of methodologies.', 'America’s Uninsured Crisis: Consequences for Health and Health Care.', 'Healthcare vulnerability disparities in pancreatic cancer treatment and mortality using the Korean National Sample Cohort: a retrospective cohort study.', 'Same Chance of Accessing Resection?

However, the differential expression of G protein α, β, and γ subunits by PCa cell lines and the precise combination of these proteins with CXCR5 has not been elucidated.  Methods:   We examined differences in G protein expression of normal prostate (RWPE-1) and PCa cell lines (LNCaP, C4-2B, and PC3) by western blot analysis. Further, we immunoprecipitated CXCR5 with different G protein subunits, and CXCR4, following CXCL13 stimulation. To investigate constitutive coupling of CXCR5 with CXCR4 and PAR-1 we performed invasion assay in PCa cells transfected with Gαq/i2 or Gα13 siRNA, following CXCL13 treatment. We also investigated Rac and RhoA activity by G-LISA activation assay in PCa cells following CXCL13/thrombin stimulation.  Result:   Of the 22 G proteins studied, Gαi1-3, Gβ1-4, Gγ5, Gγ7, and Gγ10 were expressed by both normal and PCa cell lines. Gαs was moderately expressed in C4-2B and PC3 cell lines, Gαq/11 was only present in RWPE-1 and LNCaP cell lines, while Gα12 and Gα13 were expressed in C4-2B and PC3 cell lines. Gγ9 was expressed only in PCa cell lines. Gα16, Gβ5, Gγ1-4, and Gγ13 were not detected in any of the cell lines studied. Surprisingly, CXCR4 co-immunoprecipitated with CXCR5 in PCa cell lines irrespective of CXCL13 treatment. We also identified specific G protein isoforms coupled to CXCR5 in its resting and active states. Gαq/11/Gβ3/Gγ9 in LNCaP and Gαi2/Gβ3/Gγ9 in C4-2B and PC3 cell lines, were coupled to CXCR5 and disassociated following CXCL13 stimulation. Interestingly, Gα13 co-immunoprecipitated with CXCR5 in CXCL13-treated, but not in untreated PCa cell lines. Inhibition of Gαq/i2 significantly decreased the ability of cells to invade, whereas silencing Gα13 did not affect CXCL13-dependent cell invasion. Finally, CXCL13 treatment significantly increased Rac activity in Gαq/i2 dependent manner, but not RhoA activity, in PCa cell lines.

Results:   The TT genotype in MnSOD Ile58Thr polymorphism, CC genotype in the CAT C-262T polymorphism and the GG genotype in the MPO G-463A polymorphism were the predominant genotypes amongst this Turkish male population. There was no association between MnSOD Ile58Thr polymorphism and prostate cancer. For the CAT C-262T polymorphism, the TT genotype had significantly increased prostate cancer risk compared with the CC genotype. Similarly, the TT genotype had a 1.94- and 3.83-fold increased risk for high-stage disease and metastasis, respectively, when compared with the CC genotype. For the MPO G-463A polymorphism, the GG genotype had 1.78-fold increased risk of prostate cancer compared with the AA genotype. However, no association was found regarding Gleason score, advanced and metastatic prostate cancer risk.  Conclusions:   It seems that there is no association of prostate cancer with MnSOD Ile58Thr polymorphism, whereas the TT genotype in the CAT C-262T polymorphism and the GG genotype in the MPO G-463A polymorphism may be associated with increased prostate cancer risk.

Patients and methods:   In total, 2427 patients with prostate adenocarcinoma were treated with definitive brachytherapy or brachytherapy with external beam radiation with or without ADT. Over the 20-year period of the present study (median follow-up of 78 months), patients were treated with a range of doses that were converted to the biological effective dose (BED) and/or ADT as the treatment paradigms were optimized. Using univariate and multivariate analysis, the relative impact on the biochemical control and post-treatment prostate biopsy results of BED vs ADT was determined.  Results:   The 10-year freedom from biochemical failure (FBF) was significantly affected by BED group: ≤150 Gy2 (64%), >150-200 Gy2 (88%), >200-220 Gy2 (89%) and >220 Gy2 (89.5%) (P < 0.001). When stratified into dose groups, ADT improved FPF on multivariate analysis for the BED group (<150 Gy2 , hazard ratio = 0.55; >150-200 Gy2 , hazard ratio = 0.39) but not for the higher BED groups. Among patients receiving ADT, a significant difference in 10-year FBF was seen when stratifying BED into groups ≤150 Gy2 (78%) vs >150 Gy2 (87%) (P = 0.01). On logistic regression, ADT had a significant impact on obtaining a negative biopsy (hazard ratio = 0.21) with BED <200 Gy2 , although there was no difference with BED >200 Gy2 .  Conclusions:   When treated with brachytherapy with or without EBT, ADT improves FBF only in the setting of lower doses.

Methylation specific PCR and pyrosequencing were used to determine the level of GST methylation. Pretreatment with demethylating agents enhanced the in vitro activity of brostallicin in LNCaP cells. Zebularine, in particular, induced an enhancement of activity in vivo comparable to that obtained by transfecting the human GSTP1 gene in LNCaP cells in vitro. Molecular analysis performed on tumor xenografts in mice pretreated with zebularine failed to detect re-expression of GST-pi and demethylation of GSTP1. However, we found demethylation in the GSTM1 gene, with consequent re-expression of GST-mu at the mRNA level. These results indicate that zebularine, both in vitro and in vivo, enhances the activity of brostallicin and that this enhancement correlates with re-expression of GST-pi and GST-mu. These findings highlight the potential therapeutic value of combining demethylating agents and brostallicin in tumors with GST methylation that poorly respond to brostallicin.""","""['Maria Antonietta Sabatino', 'Cristina Geroni', 'Monica Ganzinelli', 'Roberta Ceruti', 'Massimo Broggini']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Epigenetics""","""['Brostallicin, a novel anticancer agent whose activity is enhanced upon binding to glutathione.', 'Enhancement of in vivo antitumor activity of classical anticancer agents by combination with the new, glutathione-interacting DNA minor groove-binder, brostallicin.', 'Brostallicin (PNU-166196), a new minor groove DNA binder: preclinical and clinical activity.', 'Brostallicin: a new concept in minor groove DNA binder development.', 'Glutathione S-transferase pi (GSTP1) hypermethylation in prostate cancer: review 2007.', 'The paradigm of drug resistance in cancer: an epigenetic perspective.', 'DNA Methylation Malleability and Dysregulation in Cancer Progression: Understanding the Role of PARP1.', 'Understanding the Mechanisms by Which Epigenetic Modifiers Avert Therapy Resistance in Cancer.', 'Pan-Cancer Analysis Reveals the Functional Importance of Protein Lysine Modification in Cancer Development.', 'Targeting DNA Methyltranferases in Urological Tumors.']"""

Simulations were performed with the Monte-Carlo platform Gate/Geant4 for a spot-scanning proton therapy treatment and a PG camera prototype currently under investigation. The method first builds a learning set of perturbed situations corresponding to a range of patient translation. This set is then used to train a combined classifier using distal falloff and registered correlation measures. Classifier performances were evaluated using receiver operating characteristic curves and maximum associated specificity and sensitivity. A leave-one-out study showed that it is possible to detect discrepancies of 5 mm with specificity and sensitivity of 85% whereas using only distal falloff decreases the sensitivity down to 77% on the same data set. The proposed method could help to evaluate performance and to optimize the design of PG monitoring devices. It is generic: other learning sets of deviations, other measures and other types of classifiers could be studied to potentially reach better performance.

The last follow-up of the first two prospective and randomized screening studies for prostate cancer, namely the Quebec and ERSPC (European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer) clinical trials started in 1988 and 1991, respectively, have shown reductions of prostate cancer death of 62% (P<0.002) and 21% (P<0.001) (38% in the tenth and eleventh years of follow-up, P<0.003), respectively, while the PLCO (Prostate Lung Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer) screening trial reported no benefit. It has been estimated, however, that 85% of men in the planned 'non-screened' group of the US study have been screened. With such a serious flaw, the PLCO study does not have the statistical power to reach any valid conclusion. In the Quebec study, only 7.3% of men were screened in the control arm. The important benefit observed in the ERSPC study was achieved using a less than optimal 4-year PSA screening interval which misses a significant number of cancers while the Quebec study used the optimal 1-year interval.

We investigated the impact of microRNAs (miRs) in the transition of prostate cancer to CRPC. MiR-221/-222 was highly expressed in bone metastatic CRPC tumor specimens. We previously demonstrated that transient overexpression of miR-221/-222 in LNCaP promoted the development of the CRPC phenotype. In current study, we show that stably overexpressing miR-221 confers androgen independent (AI) cell growth in LNCaP by rescuing LNCaP cells from growth arrest at G1 phase due to the lack of androgen. Overexpressing of miR-221 in LNCaP reduced the transcription of a subgroup of androgen-responsive genes without affecting the androgen receptor (AR) or AR-androgen integrity. By performing systematic biochemical and bioinformatical analyses, we identified two miR-221 targets, HECTD2 and RAB1A, which could mediate the development of CRPC phenotype in multiple prostate cancer cell lines. Downregulation of HECTD2 significantly affected the androgen-induced and AR-mediated transcription, and downregulation of HECTD2 or RAB1A enhances AI cell growth. As a result of the elevated expression of miR-221, expression of many cell cycle genes was altered and pathways promoting epithelial to mesenchymal transition/tumor metastasis were activated. We hypothesize that a major biological consequence of upregulation of miR-221 is reprogramming of AR signaling, which in turn may mediate the transition to the CRPC phenotype.""","""['T Sun', 'X Wang', 'H H He', 'C J Sweeney', 'S X Liu', 'M Brown', 'S Balk', 'G-Sm Lee', 'P W Kantoff']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['miR-30a inhibits androgen-independent growth of prostate cancer via targeting MYBL2, FOXD1, and SOX4.', 'Src promotes castration-recurrent prostate cancer through androgen receptor-dependent canonical and non-canonical transcriptional signatures.', 'Androgen receptor-mediated downregulation of microRNA-221 and -222 in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptor: what we know and what we expect in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptor functions in castration-resistant prostate cancer and mechanisms of resistance to new agents targeting the androgen axis.', 'Molecular Mechanisms of Noncoding RNA in the Occurrence of Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Ki-67, topoisomerase IIα and miR-221 have a limited prostate cancer risk stratification ability on a medium-term follow-up: results of a high-risk radical prostatectomy cohort.', 'miR-221/222 as biomarkers and targets for therapeutic intervention on cancer and other diseases: A systematic review.', 'Wnt/β-catenin signal transduction pathway in prostate cancer and associated drug resistance.', 'Liver and Kidney Surgical Anatomy to Verify the Effect of miR-221 on Organ Damage in Septic Rats.']"""

Altered steroid hormone metabolism as induced by the inflammatory microenvironment may contribute to epithelial cancer progression.

We have previously reported that TGFβ1-induced reactive prostate stromal cells increase DHEA metabolism to active androgens and alter prostate cancer cell gene expression. While much of the focus on mechanisms of prostate cancer and steroid metabolism is in the epithelial cancer cells, this study focuses on TGFβ1-induced effects on DHEA metabolic pathways and enzymes in human prostate stromal cells. In DHEA-treated primary prostate stromal cells, TGFβ1 produced time- and dose-dependent increases in metabolism of DHEA to androstenedione and testosterone. Also TGFβ1-treated prostate stromal cells exhibited changes in the gene expression of enzymes involved in steroid metabolism including up-regulation of 3β hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (HSD), and down-regulation of 17βHSD5, and 17βHSD2.

We studied radical prostatectomy specimens from black and white men at very low risk to determine whether there are systematic pathological differences.  Materials and methods:   Radical prostatectomy specimens were evaluated in men with National Comprehensive Cancer Network® (NCCN) very low risk prostate cancer. At diagnosis all men underwent extended biopsy sampling (10 or more cores) and were treated in the modern Gleason grade era. We analyzed tumor volume, grade and location in 87 black and 89 white men. For each specimen the dominant nodule was defined as the largest tumor with the highest grade.  Results:   Compared to white men, black men were more likely to have significant prostate cancer (61% vs 29%), Gleason 7 or greater (37% vs 11%, each p <0.001) and a volume of greater than 0.5 cm(3) (45% vs 21%, p = 0.001).

Materials and methods:   A case-cohort design was used to sample 1,010 patients after radical prostatectomy at high risk for recurrence who were treated from 2000 to 2006. Patients had preoperative prostate specific antigen greater than 20 ng/ml, Gleason 8 or greater, pT3b or a Mayo Clinic nomogram score of 10 or greater. Patients with metastasis at diagnosis or any prior treatment for prostate cancer were excluded from analysis. A 20% random sampling created a subcohort that included all patients with metastasis. We generated 22-marker genomic classifier scores for 219 patients with available genomic data. ROC and decision curves, competing risk and weighted regression models were used to assess genomic classifier performance.  Results:   The genomic classifier AUC was 0.79 for predicting 5-year metastasis after radical prostatectomy. Decision curves showed that the genomic classifier net benefit exceeded that of clinical only models. The genomic classifier was the predominant predictor of metastasis on multivariable analysis. The cumulative incidence of metastasis 5 years after radical prostatectomy was 2.4%, 6.0% and 22.5% in patients with low (60%), intermediate (21%) and high (19%) genomic classifier scores, respectively (p<0.001).

However, the precise cellular mechanisms of the action of CL extracts remain unclear.  Aim of the study:   To examine the effects of CL samples on the anti-tumour activity of peritoneal murine macrophages.  Materials and methods:   The properties of three extracts (aqueous, flavonoid, alkaloid), one fraction (alkaloid), and one pure compound (6-hydroxycrinamidine) obtained from CL, were studied (i) for redox capacities (DPPH and bleaching beta-carotene assays), (ii) on murine peritoneal macrophages (MTT assay) and on lymphoma EL4-luc2 cells (luciferine assay) for cytotoxicity, (iii) on macrophage polarization (production of ROS and gene expression by PCR), and (iv) on the tumoricidal functions of murine peritoneal macrophages (lymphoma cytotoxicity by co-culture with syngeneic macrophages).  Results:   The total flavonoid extract with a high antioxidant activity (IC50=107.36 mg/L, DPPH assay) showed an inhibitory action on cancer cells. Alkaloid extracts inhibited the proliferation of lymphoma cells either by directly acting on tumour cells or by activating of the tumoricidal functions of syngeneic macrophages. The aqueous extract induced mRNA expression of tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) indicating differentiation of macrophages into pro-inflammatory M1 polarized macrophages. The total flavonoid, alkaloid extracts and an alkaloid fraction induced the expression of the formyl peptide receptor (FPR) on the surface of the polarized macrophages that could lead to the activation of macrophages towards the M1 phenotype. Aqueous and flavonoid extracts enhanced NADPH quinine oxido-reductase 1 (NQO1) mRNA expression in polarized macrophages which could play an important role in cancer chemoprevention.

Selenate acts by activating protein phosphatase 2A, which inhibits various signal transduction cascades, including the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway. The human colorectal carcinoma cell line DLD-1 harbors a constitutive active mutation in PIK3CA encoding the PI3K p110α catalytic subunit. Thus, we examined the anticancer effect of sodium selenate in DLD-1 cells. As expected, selenate significantly decreased cell viability and increased apoptosis at a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 0.88mM, whereas selenite was much more potent at an IC50 of 0.0061mM. Surprisingly, at lower concentrations (0.04-0.16mM), selenate induced changes in cell morphology and motility that are characteristic of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Moreover, selenate-induced EMT was associated with AKT activation, increased expression of the EMT-inducing transcription factor TWIST1 and the mesenchymal cell-specific intermediate filament vimentin, and decreased expression of the epithelial cell-specific adhesion molecule E-cadherin. The critical role of AKT activation in selenate-induced EMT was identified using the AKT inhibitor Akti-1/2, which suppressed EMT-associated cell motility and invasion. These results suggest that although sodium selenate is a potential anticancer drug, deleterious effects of EMT induction should be taken into careful consideration.""","""['Takanori Tsukamoto', 'Susumu Hama', 'Kentaro Kogure', 'Hiroyuki Tsuchiya']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Exp Cell Res""","""['Danusertib, a potent pan-Aurora kinase and ABL kinase inhibitor, induces cell cycle arrest and programmed cell death and inhibits epithelial to mesenchymal transition involving the PI3K/Akt/mTOR-mediated signaling pathway in human gastric cancer AGS and NCI-N78 cells.', ""3,5,4'-Trimethoxystilbene, a natural methoxylated analog of resveratrol, inhibits breast cancer cell invasiveness by downregulation of PI3K/Akt and Wnt/β-catenin signaling cascades and reversal of epithelial-mesenchymal transition."", 'miR-29b regulates Ang II-induced EMT of rat renal tubular epithelial cells via targeting PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.', 'Novel therapeutic strategies: targeting epithelial-mesenchymal transition in colorectal cancer.', 'The Role of PTEN in Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition.', 'Targeting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and RAF/MEK/ERK pathways for cancer therapy.', 'Therapeutic Benefits of Selenium in Hematological Malignancies.', 'Band 3/anion exchanger 1/solute carrier family 4 member 1 expression as determinant of cellular sensitivity to selenite exposure.', '5-FU inhibits migration and invasion of CRC cells through PI3K/AKT pathway regulated by MARCH1.', 'A short-term intervention with selenium affects expression of genes implicated in the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in the prostate.']"""

Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is associated with cancer invasion and metastasis promoted by pro-inflammatory cytokine TNFα. However, the mechanisms underlying TNFα-induced EMT in prostate cancer cells is not entirely clear. Here we showed that EMT induced by longstanding stimulation with TNFα in prostate cancer PC3 cells is mediated by up-regulation of the transcriptional repressor Snail. TNFα-mediated EMT was characterized by acquiring mesenchymal fusiform morphology, increasing the expression of Vimentin and decreasing the expression of E-cadherin. Exposure to TNFα increased the expression of transcription factor Snail via post-transcriptional regulation process and induced Snail nuclear localization in PC3 cells. Moreover, overexpressed Snail in PC3 cells induced EMT. Conversely, suppressing Snail expression abrogated TNFα-induced EMT, suggesting that Snail plays a crucial role in TNFα-induced EMT in prostate cancer cells. Finally, we showed that TNFα time-dependently activated NF-κB, AKT, ERK, p38 MAPK signaling pathways, and elevated Snail stability by activating AKT pathway that subsequently inhibited GSK-3β activity. Taken together, these results reveal that stabilization of Snail via AKT/GSK-3β signaling pathway is required for TNFα-induced EMT in prostate cancer cells.

Design, setting, and participants:   We reviewed 438 men with initial SPBx and 3338 men who underwent initial EPBx between January 2002 and October 2011.  Intervention:   Office-based SPBx under periprostatic local anesthesia.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The yield of SPBx was compared with EPBx. Multivariable logistic regression models addressed cancer detection (CD) and cancer characteristics.  Results and limitations:   Overall CD was 51.6% and 42.6% in men who underwent initial SPBx and EPBx, respectively. Multivariate analysis confirmed that SPBx was an independent predictor factor correlated with the CD (odds ratio [OR]: 1.66; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.30-1.92).

There was no significant difference in the detection of insignificant cancer (p = 0.223) or low-risk cancer (p = 0.077) between the two biopsy schemes. The limitation of our study is its retrospective nature and inhomogeneity.  Conclusions:   Compared with EPBx, SPBx significantly increases CD as an initial biopsy strategy in men with a PSA <10 ng/ml without a significant increase in the detection of insignificant cancer. These findings suggest that SPBx may merit further investigation as an initial biopsy strategy in men with a PSA <10 ng/ml in hopes of avoiding repeat biopsy for missed malignancy during the initial biopsy.""","""['Yong-Hong Li', 'Ahmed Elshafei', 'Jianbo Li', 'Michael Gong', 'Luay Susan', 'Khaled Fareed', 'J Stephen Jones']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Random biopsy: when, how many and where to take the cores?', 'Potential benefit of transrectal saturation prostate biopsy as an initial biopsy strategy: decreased likelihood of finding significant cancer on future biopsy.', 'A genetic score can identify men at high risk for prostate cancer among men with prostate-specific antigen of 1-3 ng/ml.', 'Saturation prostate needle biopsy and prostate cancer detection at initial and repeat evaluation.', 'Repeated biopsy in the detection of prostate cancer: when and how many cores.', 'The Influence of Serum Prostate-Specific Antigen on the Accuracy of Magnetic Resonance Imaging Targeted Biopsy versus Saturation Biopsy in Patients with Previous Negative Biopsy.', 'Random biopsy: when, how many and where to take the cores?']"""

Methods:   Four hundred sixty self-identified heterosexual and 96 self-identified nonheterosexual men completed an anonymous online survey. The men in the 2 groups were then compared using logistic regressions that controlled for differences among countries.  Results:   There were no significant differences in age at diagnosis for men in the 2 groups. However, Gleason scores at diagnosis were significantly lower for the nonheterosexual men (P = .02). There were no significant differences among men in the 2 groups in the proportion who receive different treatment modalities or in the incidence of urinary incontinence, who experience bone pain (as a marker of disease progression), who take antidepressants (as a proxy measure for mental health), or who experience erectile dysfunction after the treatment.

Perioperative or postoperative complications following RARP have been reported in some studies and severe postoperative bleeding after RARP is rare, but hemodynamic instability may necessitate open surgical exploration and be associated with considerable morbidity. We reported postoperative bleeding cases, which is a kind of complication associated with robotic surgery and requiring massive transfusion after RARP.  Patients and methods:   From August 2009 to May 2012, 317 consecutive patients who underwent RARP performed at our institution were analyzed. Patients with serious postoperative bleeding that caused hemodynamic instability after surgery were enrolled.  Results:   A total of 5 among 317 (1.6%) patients had bleeding requiring postoperative transfusion. In these cases, mean operative time was 114 min. The mean estimated blood loss was 110 ml during operation. In these patients, hematocrit (Hct) levels gradually fell after surgery and ecchymosis was detected on the side and posterior walls of the abdomen on the second day. The mean preoperative Hct was 44.3% and mean lowest Hct was 23.1%. All patients were successfully treatment without surgical exploration.

Multipresentation of a targeting molecule on a single entity has been recognized as a practical way for imaging sensitivity enhancement. Herein, we demonstrate a multivalent approach based on a (64)Cu-specific bifunctional chelator scaffold to overcome the endogenous phosphate competition thus enabling the utility of GPI conjugates for in vivo detection of PSMA and imaging quantification. Both monomeric (H2CBT1G) and dimeric (H2CBT2G) conjugates were synthesized and labeled with (64)Cu for in vitro and in vivo evaluations. A 4-fold enhancement of PSMA binding affinity was observed for H2CBT2G as compared to H2CBT1G from the PSMA competitive binding assays performed on LNCaP cells. In vivo PET imaging studies were conducted on mouse xenograft models established with a PSMA(+) cell line, LNCaP, and PSMA(-) PC3 and H2009 cell lines. (64)Cu-CBT2G showed significantly higher LNCaP tumor uptake than (64)Cu-CBT1G at 1, 4, and 24 h postinjection (p.i.) (p < 0.05). In addition, tumor uptake of (64)Cu-CBT2G remained steady out to 24 h p.i.

The PSMA imaging specificity of both H2CBT1G and H2CBT2G was demonstrated by their low uptake in PSMA(-) tumors (PC3 and H2009) and further confirmed by a significant signal reduction in PSMA(+) LNCaP tumors in the blockade study. In addition, the LNCaP tumor uptake (% ID/g) of (64)Cu-CBT2G was found to be in a positive linear correlation with the tumor size (R(2) = 0.92, 0.94, and 0.93 for 1 h, 4 h, and 24 h p.i.).

There is some evidence that a higher modified Glasgow Prognostic Score (mGPS) may be associated with poorer survival in patients with prostate cancer but it is not known whether this is independent of other established prognostic factors. Therefore the aim of this study was to describe the relationship between mGPS and survival in patients with prostate cancer after adjustment for other prognostic factors.  Methods:   Retrospective clinical series on patients in Glasgow, Scotland, for whom data from the Scottish Cancer Registry, including Gleason score, Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA), C-reactive protein (CRP) and albumin, six months prior to or following the diagnosis, were included in this study.  Results:   Seven hundred and forty four prostate cancer patients were identified; of these, 497 (66.8%) died during a maximum follow up of 11.9 years. Patients with mGPS of 2 had poorest 5-year and 10-year relative survival, of 32.6% and 18.8%, respectively. Raised mGPS also had a significant association with excess risk of death at five years (mGPS 2: Relative Excess Risk = 3.57, 95% CI 2.31-5.52) and ten years (mGPS 2: Relative Excess Risk = 3.42, 95% CI 2.25-5.21) after adjusting for age, socioeconomic circumstances, Gleason score, PSA and previous in-patient bed days.

Neither PI3K nor mTOR blockade could completely inhibit the pathway owing to paradoxical feedback, so we anticipate dual PI3K/mTOR blockade by NVP-BEZ235 to radiosensitize prostate cancer cells.  Methods:   We investigated into the radiosensitizing effect of NVP-BEZ235 on PC-3 cells, which are devoid of androgen receptors. Clonogenic survival and MTT assays were performed, and to pursue underlying cellular changes flow cytometric analysis of cell cycle and apoptosis as well as western blot were carried out.  Results:   Exposure to NVP-BEZ235 and irradiation caused a greater degree of survival inhibition than ionizing radiation (IR) or BEZ235 alone. Dual PI3K/mTOR blockade along with IR induced a G2/M arrest and enhanced proapoptotic effect. NVP-BEZ235 radiosensitized PC-3 cells through counteracting constitutive as well as IR-triggered activation of Akt/mTOR signaling.  Conclusions:   Our study demonstrated that the dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor NVP-BEZ235 prominently improved the radiosensitivity of PC-3 cells.

Elevated expression of IGFBP2 is associated with progression of tumors that include prostate, ovarian, glioma among others. Though implicated in the progression of breast cancer, the molecular mechanisms involved in IGFBP2 actions are not well defined. This study investigates the molecular targets and biological pathways targeted by IGFBP2 in breast cancer.  Methods:   Transcriptome analysis of breast tumor cells (BT474) with stable knockdown of IGFBP2 and breast tumors having differential expression of IGFBP2 by immunohistochemistry was performed using microarray. Differential gene expression was established using R-Bioconductor package. For validation, gene expression was determined by qPCR. Inhibitors of IGF1R and integrin pathway were utilized to study the mechanism of regulation of β-catenin. Immunohistochemical and immunocytochemical staining was performed on breast tumors and experimental cells, respectively for β-catenin and IGFBP2 expression.  Results:   Knockdown of IGFBP2 resulted in differential expression of 2067 up regulated and 2002 down regulated genes in breast cancer cells. Down regulated genes principally belong to cell cycle, DNA replication, repair, p53 signaling, oxidative phosphorylation, Wnt signaling. Whole genome expression analysis of breast tumors with or without IGFBP2 expression indicated changes in genes belonging to Focal adhesion, Map kinase and Wnt signaling pathways. Interestingly, IGFBP2 knockdown clones showed reduced expression of β- catenin compared to control cells which was restored upon IGFBP2 re-expression. The regulation of β-catenin by IGFBP2 was found to be IGF1R and integrin pathway dependent. Furthermore, IGFBP2 and β-catenin are co-ordinately overexpressed in breast tumors and correlate with lymph node metastasis.

In this study, tumorigenic potential was increased in the docetaxel-resistant residual prostate cancer cell lines (DRD, 1G7 and PC3DR) compared with parental cells (DU145 or PC3). Enhanced tumorigenic potential was conferred by oncogenic c-Myc, which was stabilized by constitutively activated ERK1/2 in DRD, 1G7, and PC3DR cells. Constitutively activated ERK1/2 was maintained by CXCR4, which was upregulated in DRD, 1G7, and PC3DR cells. In docetaxel-treated DU145 cells, transiently activated ERK1/2 induced CXCR4 expression by stabilizing c-Myc. Furthermore, constitutive activation of CXCR4, ERK1/2, and c-Myc signaling was evident in clinical tissue samples from human patients with docetaxel-resistant prostate cancer. In DTX-resistant residual prostate cancer cells, the enhanced tumorigenic potential was reduced by ERK1/2 inhibition, or by AMD3100, a CXCR4 antagonist. Thus, docetaxel treatment constitutively activated the CXCR4, ERK1/2, and c-Myc signaling loop in docetaxel-resistant residual prostate cancer cells.

Multiparametric prostate magnetic resonance imaging (MP-MRI) with ultrasound (US)-targeted fusion biopsy may better sample the true gland pathology.  Objective:   The rate of Gleason score upgrading from an MRI/US-fusion-guided prostate-biopsy platform is compared with a standard 12-core biopsy regimen alone.  Design, setting, and participants:   There were 582 subjects enrolled from August 2007 through August 2012 in a prospective trial comparing systematic, extended 12-core transrectal ultrasound biopsies to targeted MRI/US-fusion-guided prostate biopsies performed during the same biopsy session.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The highest Gleason score from each biopsy method was compared.  Interventions:   An MRI/US-fusion-guided platform with electromagnetic tracking was used for the performance of the fusion-guided biopsies.  Results and limitations:   A diagnosis of prostate cancer (PCa) was made in 315 (54%) of the patients. Addition of targeted biopsy led to Gleason upgrading in 81 (32%) cases. Targeted biopsy detected 67% more Gleason ≥4+3 tumors than 12-core biopsy alone and missed 36% of Gleason ≤3+4 tumors, thus mitigating the detection of lower-grade disease. Conversely, 12-core biopsy led to upgrading in 67 (26%) cases over targeted biopsy alone but only detected 8% more Gleason ≥4+3 tumors. On multivariate analysis, MP-MRI suspicion was associated with Gleason score upgrading in the targeted lesions (p<0.001).

Yet, its role in the biology of prostate cancer remains poorly understood.  Methods:   In this study we investigated the expression of four major autophagy proteins, namely the microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3A (LC3A), LC3B, Beclin 1, and p62, together with an enzyme of anaerobic metabolism, the lactate dehydrogenase 5 (LDH5), in relation to Gleason score and extraprostatic invasion. A series of 96 prostate adenocarcinomas was examined using immunohistochemical techniques and appropriate antibodies.  Results:   The LC3A protein was expressed in the form of ""stone-like"" structures, and diffuse cytoplasmic staining, the LC3B reactivity was solely cytoplasmic, whereas that of p62 and LDH5 was both cytoplasmic and nuclear. A median count of 0.90 ""stone-like"" structures per 200 × optical field (range 0-3.6) was highly associated with a high Gleason score. Similarly, a strong cytoplasmic LC3A, LC3B, and p62 expression, when extensive (present in>50% tumor cells per section), was significantly associated with LDH5 and a high Gleason score. In addition, extensive cytoplasmic p62 expression was related with LC3A and B reactivity and also with extraprostatic invasion. Extensive Beclin-1 expression was significantly linked with extraprostatic invasion and also with p62 and LDH5 expression.

Methods:   We studied a prospective cohort of solid cancer patients aged ≥70 years at referral to two geriatric oncology clinics between 2007 and 2010. Nutrition was evaluated using the Mini-Nutritional Assessment (MNA) using validated cut-offs (<17: malnutrition, 17-23.5: at-risk for malnutrition). Patients with non-digestive tumours (breast, prostate, urinary tract) and with digestive (colorectal, upper digestive tract and liver) were analysed separately using multinomial logistic regression.  Results:   Of 643 consecutive patients, 519 had available data (median age, 80; men, 48.2%; metastases, 46.3%; digestive cancer 47.8%). In non-digestive group, 13.3% had malnutrition versus 28.6% in digestive group. The link between metastasis and malnutrition was significantly higher in non-digestive group (adjusted odds ratio [ORa ], 25.25; 95%CI: 5.97-106.8) than in digestive group (ORa, 2.59; 1.08-6.24; p for heterogeneity = 0.04).

Because adaptive pathways activated by treatment facilitate development of acquired resistance, cotargeting the stress response, activated by AR inhibition and mediated through CLU, may create conditional lethality and improve outcomes. Here, we report that CLU is induced by AR antagonism and silencing using MDV3100 and antisense, respectively, to become highly expressed in castrate- and MDV3100-resistant tumors and cell lines. CLU, as well as AKT and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalosomes, increase in response to MDV3100-induced stress. Mechanistically, this stress response is coordinated by a feed-forward loop involving p90rsk (RPS6KA)-mediated phosphoactivation of YB-1 with subsequent induction of CLU. CLU inhibition repressed MDV3100-induced activation of AKT and MAPK pathways. In addition, when combined with MDV3100, CLU knockdown accelerated AR degradation and repressed AR transcriptional activity through mechanisms involving decreased YB-1-regulated expression of the AR cochaperone, FKBP52. Cotargeting the AR (with MDV3100) and CLU (with OGX-011) synergistically enhanced apoptotic rates over that seen with MDV3100 or OGX-011 monotherapy and delayed CRPC LNCaP tumor and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression in vivo. These data indicate that cotargeting adaptive stress pathways activated by AR pathway inhibitors, and mediated through CLU, creates conditional lethality and provides mechanistic and preclinical proof-of-principle to guide biologically rational combinatorial clinical trial design.""","""['Hiroaki Matsumoto', 'Yoshiaki Yamamoto', 'Masaki Shiota', 'Hidetoshi Kuruma', 'Eliana Beraldi', 'Hideyasu Matsuyama', 'Amina Zoubeidi', 'Martin Gleave']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Cancer Res""","""['siRNA Lipid Nanoparticle Potently Silences Clusterin and Delays Progression When Combined with Androgen Receptor Cotargeting in Enzalutamide-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Reciprocal feedback inhibition of the androgen receptor and PI3K as a novel therapy for castrate-sensitive and -resistant prostate cancer.', 'Galectin-3 Is Implicated in Tumor Progression and Resistance to Anti-androgen Drug Through Regulation of Androgen Receptor Signaling in Prostate Cancer.', 'Understanding the mechanisms of androgen deprivation resistance in prostate cancer at the molecular level.', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Chronic hypoxia favours adoption to a castration-resistant cell state in prostate cancer.', 'Cell-Type-Specific Signalling Networks Impacted by Prostate Epithelial-Stromal Intercellular Communication.', 'Recombinant Human Clusterin Seals Damage to the Ocular Surface Barrier in a Mouse Model of Ophthalmic Preservative-Induced Epitheliopathy.', 'AR Structural Variants and Prostate Cancer.', 'The role and function of CLU in cancer biology and therapy.']"""

Id4 is expressed in the normal prostate where its expression is also regulated by androgens. In this study we investigated the effect of loss of Id4 (Id4-/-) on adult prostate morphology.  Methods:   Histological analysis was performed on prostates from 6-8 weeks old Id4-/-, Id4+/- and Id4+/+ mice. Expression of Id1, Sox9, Myc, androgen receptor, Akt, p-Akt, Pten and Nkx3.1 was investigated by immunohistochemistry. Androgen receptor binding on NKX3.1 promoter was studied by chromatin immuno-precipitation. Id4 was either over-expressed or silenced in prostate cancer cell lines DU145 and LNCaP respectively followed by analysis of PTEN, NKX3.1 and Sox9 expression.  Results:   Id4-/- mice had smaller prostates with fewer tubules, smaller tubule diameters and subtle mPIN like lesions. Levels of androgen receptor were similar between wild type and Id4-/- prostate. Decreased NKX3.1 expression was in part due to decreased androgen receptor binding on NKX3.1 promoter in Id4-/- mice. The increase in the expression of Myc, Sox9, Id1, Ki67 and decrease in the expression of PTEN, Akt and phospho-AKT was associated with subtle mPIN like lesions in Id4-/- prostates. Finally, prostate cancer cell line models in which Id4 was either silenced or over-expressed confirmed that Id4 regulates NKX3.1, Sox9 and PTEN.  Conclusions:   Our results suggest that loss of Id4 attenuates normal prostate development and promotes hyperplasia/dysplasia with subtle mPIN like lesions characterized by gain of Myc and Id1 and loss of Nkx3.1 and Pten expression. One of the mechanisms by which Id4 may regulate normal prostate development is through regulating androgen receptor binding to respective response elements such as those on NKX3.1 promoter. In spite of these complex alterations, large neoplastic lesions in Id4-/- prostates were not observed suggesting the possibility of mechanisms/pathways such as loss of Akt that could restrain the formation of significant pre-cancerous lesions.""","""['Pankaj Sharma', 'Ashley Evans Knowell', 'Swathi Chinaranagari', 'Shravan Komaragiri', 'Peri Nagappan', 'Divya Patel', 'Mathew C Havrda', 'Jaideep Chaudhary']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Mol Cancer""","""['The helix-loop-helix transcriptional regulator Id4 is required for terminal differentiation of luminal epithelial cells in the prostate.', 'Loss of Nkx3.1 leads to the activation of discrete downstream target genes during prostate tumorigenesis.', 'MYC overexpression induces prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and loss of Nkx3.1 in mouse luminal epithelial cells.', 'Mechanisms of prostate tumorigenesis: roles for transcription factors Nkx3.1 and Egr1.', 'Cross-talk between the androgen receptor and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway in prostate cancer.', 'The Current State of Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) from FFPE Tissues.', 'Targeted Disruption of the Inhibitor of DNA Binding 4 (Id4) Gene Alters Photic Entrainment of the Circadian Clock.', 'The helix-loop-helix transcriptional regulator Id4 is required for terminal differentiation of luminal epithelial cells in the prostate.', 'Inhibitor of Differentiation 4 (ID4) represses mammary myoepithelial differentiation via inhibition of HEB.', 'TIP5 primes prostate luminal cells for the oncogenic transformation mediated by PTEN-loss.']"""

Subsequent to the discovery of XMRV, many additional cell lines that underwent xenotransplantation in mice have been shown to harbor murine gammaretroviruses. Such retroviral infection poses the threat of not only confounding experiments performed in these cell lines via virus-induced changes in cellular behavior but also the potential infection of other cell lines cultured in the same laboratory.

Treatment of cells with triol dose-dependently suppressed proliferation of LNCaP CDXR-3, DU-145, and PC-3 human prostate cancer cells and reduced colony formation in soft agar. Oral administration of triol at 20 mg/kg daily for three weeks significantly retarded the growth of PC-3 xenografts in nude mice. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that triol treatment at 10-40 µM caused G1 cell cycle arrest while the TUNEL assay indicated that triol treatment at 20-40 µM induced apoptosis in all three cell lines. Micro-Western Arrays and traditional Western blotting methods indicated that triol treatment resulted in reduced expression of Akt1, phospho-Akt Ser473, phospho-Akt Thr308, PDK1, c-Myc, and Skp2 protein levels as well as accumulation of the cell cycle inhibitor p27(Kip). Triol treatment also resulted in reduced Akt1 protein expression in PC-3 xenografts. Overexpression of Skp2 in PC-3 cells partially rescued the growth inhibition caused by triol. Triol treatment suppressed migration and invasion of DU-145, PC-3, and CDXR-3 cells. The expression levels of proteins associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition as well as focal adhesion kinase were affected by triol treatment in these cells. Triol treatment caused increased expression of E-cadherin protein levels but decreased expression of N-cadherin, vimentin, Slug, FAK, phospho-FAK Ser722, and phospho-FAK Tyr861 protein levels.

Survival curves based on Kaplan-Meier estimates are presented.  Results:   Among the 87 patients, 61 were dead at the time of last follow-up. Median OS was 16.5 mo (95% confidence interval [CI], 12.1-23.4 mo), and the OS probability at 24 mo was 39% ± 6%. For the univariate analysis, the hazard ratios associated with each unit increase were 1.01 (95% CI, 1.006-1.02) for sum of SUV(max) (P = 0.002), 1.11 (95% CI, 1.03-1.18) for maximum SUV(max) (P = 0.010), and 1.13 (95% CI, 0.99-1.30) for average SUV(max) (P = 0.095). For the multivariable analysis adjusting for relevant clinical parameters, the continuous parameter sum of SUV(max) remained significant (P = 0.053), with a hazard ratio of 1.01 (95% CI, 1.001-1.02). When sum of SUV(max) was grouped into quartile ranges, there was poorer survival probability for the patients in the fourth-quartile range than for those in the first-quartile range, with a univariate hazard ratio of 3.8 (95% CI, 1.8-7.9).  Conclusion:   Sum of SUV(max) derived from (18)F-FDG PET/CT contributes independent prognostic information on OS in men with castrate-resistant metastatic prostate cancer, and this information may be useful in assessing the comparative effectiveness of various conventional and emerging treatment strategies.""","""['Hossein Jadvar', 'Bhushan Desai', 'Lingyun Ji', 'Peter S Conti', 'Tanya B Dorff', 'Susan G Groshen', 'Jacek K Pinski', 'David I Quinn']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""['Prediction of Time to Hormonal Treatment Failure in Metastatic Castration-Sensitive Prostate Cancer with 18F-FDG PET/CT.', '18F-FDG PET and combined 18F-FDG-contrast CT parameters as predictors of tumor control for hepatocellular carcinoma after stereotactic ablative radiotherapy.', 'Prognosis Related to Metastatic Burden Measured by ¹⁸F-Fluorocholine PET/CT in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Prognostic value of metabolic tumor burden on 18F-FDG PET in nonsurgical patients with non-small cell lung cancer.', 'Imaging evaluation of prostate cancer with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose PET/CT: utility and limitations.', 'Prognostic value of pre-treatment FDG PET/CT SUVmax for metastatic lesions in de novo metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma following chemotherapy and locoregional radiotherapy.', ""Gene's expression underpinning the divergent predictive value of 18FF-fluorodeoxyglucose and prostate-specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography in primary prostate cancer: a bioinformatic and experimental study."", 'The Performance of FDA-Approved PET Imaging Agents in the Detection of Prostate Cancer.', 'Molecular Imaging Assessment of Androgen Deprivation Therapy in Prostate Cancer.', 'Beyond the Prognostic Value of 2-18FFDG PET/CT in Prostate Cancer: A Case Series and Literature Review Focusing on the Diagnostic Value and Impact on Patient Management.']"""

There is clear evidence that melanoma cells and stromal cells of tumor environment can induce lymphangiogenesis, e.g. growth of lymphatic vessels, and this phenomenon is correlated with lymph node metastases. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) C represents the most potent and well-recognized lymphangiogenic growth factor secreted in tumor milieu by melanoma cells and tumor-associated macrophages, however the mechanism underlying VEGF-C secretion is not completely understood. We demonstrate that an acidic extracellular pH promotes the expression of VEGF-C in A375P melanoma cells and in melanoma cells isolated from a human spontaneous metastatic lesion, through the NF-κB transcription factor. We also demonstrate that esomeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor which requires acidosis to be activated, is able to prevent VEGF-C expression in acidic melanoma cells by interfering with NF-κB activation. Furthermore, we show that esomeprazole abrogates the enhanced VEGF-C expression in tumor cells grown in a acidic medium and stimulated by IL-1β. On the whole, the present study reveals that acidity may be considered a strong promoter of VEGF-C expression in melanoma cells and provides a new pharmacological target to limit the development of tumor lymphangiogenesis.""","""['Silvia Peppicelli', 'Francesca Bianchini', 'Claudia Contena', 'Donatella Tombaccini', 'Lido Calorini']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Clin Exp Metastasis""","""['Lymphangiogenesis and its relationship with lymphatic metastasis and prognosis in malignant melanoma.', 'Vascular endothelial growth factor-C expression correlates with lymph node localization of human melanoma metastases.', 'RNAi-mediated gene silencing of vascular endothelial growth factor-C inhibits tumor lymphangiogenesis and growth of gastric cancer in vivo in mice.', 'Lipopolysaccharide increases the release of VEGF-C that enhances cell motility and promotes lymphangiogenesis and lymphatic metastasis through the TLR4- NF-κB/JNK pathways in colorectal cancer.', 'Tumor lymphangiogenesis and melanoma metastasis.', 'Effects of PPIs use on clinical outcomes of urothelial cancer patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy.', 'Physicochemical aspects of the tumour microenvironment as drivers of vasculogenic mimicry.', 'An Up-To-Date Investigation Into the Correlation Between Proton Pump Inhibitor Use and the Clinical Efficacy of Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors in Advanced Solid Cancers: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'uPAR Controls Vasculogenic Mimicry Ability Expressed by Drug-Resistant Melanoma Cells.', 'Acid-sensing ion channel 1 (ASIC1) mediates weak acid-induced migration of human malignant glioma cells.']"""

Design:   Historical cohort study.  Setting:   Oncology unit in a university teaching hospital in Hong Kong.  Patients:   Patients with clinically localised prostate cancer undergoing intensity-modulated radiation therapy in our institution between May 2001 and November 2009 were reviewed.  Main outcome measures:   The 5-year biochemical failure–free survival, 5-year overall survival, as well as acute/late gastro-intestinal toxicities and genito-urinary toxicities.  Results:   A total of 182 patients were treated with prostate intensitymodulated radiation therapy with or without whole-pelvic radiotherapy. The median follow-up was 44 months. The median patient age was 72 years. Overall survival of the cohort was 92% after 5 years. The favourable, intermediate, and unfavourable risk category distributions of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network were 21 (12%), 42 (23%), and 119 (65%), respectively. The 5-year actuarial biochemical failure–free survival rates for patients in these categories were 95%, 82%, and 80%, respectively. Multivariate analysis identified early tumour stage, low pre-treatment prostate-specific antigen levels, and the use of adjuvant androgen deprivation as independent prognostic factors for better biochemical failure–free survival. Grade 2 and 3 late gastro-intestinal/genito-urinary toxicities occurred in 8%/3% and 4%/3% of the patients, respectively.

In particular, miRNAs and mRNAs cooperate to affect biological processes, including tumorigenesis. The complexity of miRNA-mRNA interactions presents a major barrier to identifying their co-regulatory roles and functional effects. Thus, by computationally modeling these complex relationships, it may be possible to infer the gene interaction networks underlying complicated biological processes.  Results:   We propose a data-driven, hypergraph structural method for constructing higher-order miRNA-mRNA interaction networks from cancer genomic profiles. The proposed model explicitly characterizes higher-order relationships among genetic factors, from which cooperative gene activities in biological processes may be identified. The proposed model is learned by iteration of structure and parameter learning. The structure learning efficiently constructs a hypergraph structure by generating putative hyperedges representing complex miRNA-mRNA modules. It adopts an evolutionary method based on information-theoretic criteria. In the parameter learning phase, the constructed hypergraph is refined by updating the hyperedge weights using the gradient descent method. From the model, we produce biologically relevant higher-order interaction networks showing the properties of primary and metastatic prostate cancer, as candidates of potential miRNA-mRNA regulatory circuits.  Conclusions:   Our approach focuses on potential cancer-specific interactions reflecting higher-order relationships between miRNAs and mRNAs from expression profiles.

Material and methods:   In 2006 a multicentre Italian report on RP evaluated the surgical and functional characteristics of prostate cancer and RP outcomes. Age and waist circumference (WC) were recorded. Abdominal obesity was defined as a WC of at least 102 cm. International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) score, prostate-specific antigen, prostate volume, tumour characteristics, presence/absence of perioperative complications and the number of blood units transfused were recorded. Preoperative and postoperative continence status was evaluated. Spearman correlation coefficient and binary logistic regression analyses were conducted.  Results:   In total, 470 men were recruited. A significant negative correlation between WC and preoperative IIEF scores was observed (r = -0.032, p < 0.001). Non-obese patients presented a preoperative IIEF score of 18.8 ± 6.0 and obese patients an IIEF score of 16.0 ± 7.0 (p < 0.001). Obese men are at three-fold greater risk of intraoperative complications and blood transfusions than those with a WC below 102 cm [adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 3.116, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.281-16.348, p < 0.001, and OR = 2.763, 95% CI 0.518-3.843, p < 0.050, respectively]. A significant positive correlation between WC and postprostatectomy incontinence severity was observed. The risk of needing at least two pads per day is two and a half times greater in men with a WC of at least 102 cm than in those with a WC below 102 cm (adjusted OR = 2.435, 95% CI 0.321-7.668, p = 0.007).

Since 2005, the presence of the genetic rearrangement between transmembrane-serine protease gene (TMPRSS2) and the erythroblast transformation-specific (ETS) member ERG (v-ets erythroblastosis virus E26 oncogene homolog avian) has been demonstrated in almost half of PCa cases. Both FISH and RT-PCR are useful tools for detecting these rearrangements, but very few comparatives between both techniques have been published. In this study, we included FFPE tumors from 294 PCa patients treated with radical prostatectomy with more than 5 years of followup. We constructed a total of 20 tissue microarrays in order to perform break-apart and tricolor probe FISH approaches that were compared with RT-PCR, showing a concordance of 80.6% (P < 0.001). The presence of TMPRSS2-ERG rearrangement was observed in 56.6% of cases. No association between TMPRSS2-ERG status and clinicopathological parameters nor biochemical progression and clinical progression free survival was found.

As CSCs demonstrate resistance to chemoradiation therapy relative to other cancer cells, this allows the enrichment of CSC populations by killing apoptosis-susceptible cancer cells. In this study, three commonly used human prostate cancer (PCa) cell lines (DU145, PC-3 and LNCaP) were examined for their expression of the putative stem cell markers CD133 and CD44 via flow cytometric analysis. Under normal culture conditions, CD133(+)/CD44(+) cells were only present in the DU145 cell line, and comprised only a minor percentage (0.1% ± 0.01%) of the total population. However, the proportion of these CD133(+)/CD44(+) prostate CSCs could be increased in these cell lines via culture in serum-free medium (SFM), or through chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Indeed, after culture in SFM, the proportion of CD133(+)/CD44(+) cells in DU145 and PC-3 had increased to 10.3% and 3.0%, respectively. Moreover, the proportion had increased to 9.8% enriched by chemotherapy and 3.5% by radiotherapy in DU145. Colony-formation tests, cell invasion assays, and tumor xenografts in BALB/c nude mice were used to evaluate the stem cell properties of CD133(+)/CD44(+) PCa cells that were isolated via fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). CD133(+)/CD44(+) cells had an enhanced colony-formation capability and invasive ability in vitro, and displayed greater tumorigenic properties in vivo. These results demonstrate the presence of CD133(+)/CD44(+) prostate CSCs in established PCa cell lines and that populations of these cells can be enriched by culture in SFM or chemoradiotherapy. Finding novel therapies to override chemoradiation resistance in the prostate CSCs is the key to improve long-term results in PCa management.""","""['Lei Wang', 'Xing Huang', 'Xinmin Zheng', 'Xinghuan Wang', 'Shiwen Li', 'Lin Zhang', 'Zhonghua Yang', 'Zhiping Xia']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Int J Biol Sci""","""['Evaluation of CD44 and CD133 as cancer stem cell markers for colorectal cancer.', 'ALDH activity selectively defines an enhanced tumor-initiating cell population relative to CD133 expression in human pancreatic adenocarcinoma.', 'Isolation, Culture and Identification of Choriocarcinoma Stem-Like Cells from the Human Choriocarcinoma Cell-Line JEG-3.', 'CD133-targeted niche-dependent therapy in cancer: a multipronged approach.', 'Cancer stem cells in lung cancer: Evidence and controversies.', 'Suspension culture strategies to enrich colon cancer stem cells.', 'Distinct Expression of Surface and Genetic Biomarkers in Prostate Cancer Cell Lines.', 'Prostate Cancer Stem Cells: The Role of CD133.', 'Silencing of Fused Toes Homolog (FTS) Increases Radiosensitivity to Carbon-Ion Through Downregulation of Notch Signaling in Cervical Cancer Cells.', 'The microRNA-210-Stathmin1 Axis Decreases Cell Stiffness to Facilitate the Invasiveness of Colorectal Cancer Stem Cells.']"""

The laboratory and clinical study of cancer immunotherapy is rapidly advancing. However, in the clinical setting, the results of cancer immunotherapy are mixed. We therefore contend that cancer immunotherapy should be customized to each patient individually based on their immune status and propose an integrative immunotherapy approach with second-generation group-specific component macrophage activating factor (GcMAF)-containing human serum.  Patients and methods:   The standard protocol of our integrative cancer immunotherapy is as follows: i) 0.5 ml GcMAF-containing human serum is administered intramuscularly or subcutaneously once or twice per week for the duration of cancer therapy until all cancer cells are eradicated; ii) hyper T/natural killer (NK) cell therapy is given once per week for six weeks; iii) high-dose vitamin C is administered intravenously twice per week; iv) alpha lipoic acid (600 mg) is administered orally daily; v) vitamin D3 (5,000-10,000 IU) is administered orally daily.  Results:   By March 2013, Saisei Mirai have treated over 345 patients with GcMAF.

The primary aim of this study was to assess the prognostic impact of NLR in a clinically annotated cohort of patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). We hypothesised that elevated NLR would be associated with worse prognosis. Between 2004 and 2009, 137 patients had surgery for GBM and were assessed for consideration of adjuvant therapy at our institution. Of these, 84 patients with an evaluable pre-corticosteroid full blood count result were identified and included in the final analysis. Median overall survival was 9.3 months (range 0.7-82.1). On univariate analysis, age >65 years, gender, ECOG performance status ≥2, frontal tumour, extent of surgical resection, completion of adjuvant chemoradiation protocol and NLR > 4 were significantly correlated with overall survival. Patients with NLR > 4, had a worse median overall survival at 7.5 months versus 11.2 months in patients with NLR ≤ 4 (hazard ratio 1.6, 95 % CI 1.00-2.52, p = 0.048). On multivariate analysis NLR > 4 remained an independent prognostic indicator for poor outcome. These data are an important reminder of the potential relevance of host immunity in GBM. In our cohort, NLR > 4 conferred a worse prognosis independent of other well established prognostic factors. If validated in other cohorts NLR may prove to be a useful addition in predicting prognosis in GBM patients.

To identify the molecular mechanisms underlying acquired resistance, we developed and characterized cell lines resistant to ARN-509 and enzalutamide. In a subset of cell lines, ARN-509 and enzalutamide exhibit agonist activity due to a missense mutation (F876L) in the ligand-binding domain of the androgen receptor (AR). AR F876L is sufficient to confer resistance to ARN-509 and enzalutamide in in vitro and in vivo models of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Importantly, the AR F876L mutant is detected in plasma DNA from ARN-509-treated patients with progressive CRPC. Thus, selective outgrowth of AR F876L is a clinically relevant mechanism of second-generation antiandrogen resistance that can potentially be targeted with next-generation antiandrogens.  Significance:   A missense mutation in the ligand-binding domain of the androgen receptor F876L confers resistance to the second-generation antiandrogens enzalutamide and ARN-509 in preclinical models of AR function and prostate cancer and is detected in plasma DNA from ARN-509-treated patients with progressive disease.

Thus, tissue-based markers are urgently needed to improve treatment and surveillance decision-making. Given that shortened telomeres enhance chromosomal instability and such instability is a hallmark of metastatic lesions, we hypothesized that alterations in telomere length in the primary cancer would predict risk of progression to metastasis and prostate cancer death. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a prospective cohort study of 596 surgically treated men who participated in the ongoing Health Professionals Follow-up Study. Men who had the combination of more variable telomere length among prostate cancer cells (cell-to-cell) and shorter telomere length in prostate cancer-associated stromal (CAS) cells were substantially more likely to progress to metastasis or die of their prostate cancer. These findings point to the translational potential of this telomere biomarker for prognostication and risk stratification for individualized therapeutic and surveillance strategies.

Methods:   We retrospectively analyzed 253 radical prostatectomy cases performed between 2006 and 2011. The patients were divided into 4 groups for the data analysis and dichotomized according to the preoperative PSA, <10 ng/mL and ≥10 ng/mL. A p-score <0.05 was considered significant.  Results:   The average patient age was 63.3±7.8 years. The median PSA level was 9.3±4.9 ng/mL. The overall concordance between the Gleason scores was 52%. Patients presented preoperative PSA levels <10 ng/mL in 153 of 235 cases (65%) and ≥10 ng/mL in 82 of 235 cases (35%). The Gleason scores were identical in 86 of 153 cases (56%) in the <10 ng/mL group and 36 of 82 (44%) cases in the ≥10 ng/mL group (p=0.017). The biopsy underestimated the Gleason score in 45 (30%) patients in the <10 ng/mL group and 38 (46%) patients in the ≥10 ng/mL (p=0.243). Specifically, the patients with Gleason 3 + 3 scores according to the biopsies demonstrated global concordance in 56 of 110 cases (51%). In this group, the patients with preoperative PSA levels <10 ng/dL had higher concordance than those with preoperative PSA levels ≥10 ng/dL (61% x 23%, p=0.023), which resulted in 77% upgrading after surgery in those patients with PSA levels ≥10 ng/dl.  Conclusion:   The Gleason scores of needle prostate biopsies and those of the surgical specimens were concordant in approximately half of the global sample.

We have found that miRNA-100 is underexpressed in metastatic prostate cancer compared to localized disease. Conversely higher levels of miR-100 are related to biochemical recurrence after surgery. This suggests that miR-100 may be a context-dependent miRNA, acting as oncogene or tumor suppressor miRNA. Our aim is to demonstrate the role of miR-100 in the control of predicted target genes in prostate cancer cell lines.  Methods:   Cell lines DU145 and PC3 were transfected with miR-100, antimiR-100 and after 24 h and 48 h of exposure, qRT-PCR and western blot were performed for mTOR, FGFR3, THAP2, SMARCA5 and BAZ2A.  Results:   There was reduction in mTOR (p=0.025), THAP2 (p=0.038), SMARCA5 (p=0.001) and BAZ2A (p=0.006) mRNA expression in DU145 cells after exposure to miR-100. In PC3 cells, mTOR expression was decreased by miR-100 (p=0.01). There was a reduction in the expression levels of proteins encoded by studied genes, ranging from 34% to 69%.  Conclusions:   We demonstrate that miR-100 is a context-dependent miRNA controlling BAZ2, mTOR, FGFR3, SMARCA5 and THAP2 that might be involved in PC progression.

Accumulating studies have demonstrated that these two proteins are attractive targets for specific delivery of functional molecules to advanced PC, not merely as potential sensitive markers for PC detection. In this study, we constructed a dual-modified liposome that incorporated PSA-responsive and PSMA-mediated liposomes and potentially offers double selectivity for PC. The folate moiety binds quickly to PSMA-positive tumors, and the PSA-responsive moiety is cleaved by PSA that was enriched in tumor tissues. The activated liposomes (folate and cell-penetrating peptides dual-modifications) are subsequently taken up by the tumor cells via polyarginine's penetrating effects and receptor-mediated endocytosis. To corroborate these assumptions, a series of experiments were conducted, including PSA-responsive peptide hydrolysis kinetics, cellular uptake, internalization mechanism and escape from endosomes in PC-3 and/or 22Rv1 cells, biodistribution and antitumor activity of siRNA-loaded liposomes after systemic administration, gene silencing and cell apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. The results reveal that multivalent interactions play a key role in enhancing PC cell recognition and uptake while reducing nonspecific uptake. The dual-modified liposomes carrying small interfering RNA (siRNA) have significant advantages over the control liposomes, including single-modified (folate, CPP, PSA-responsive only) and non-modified liposomes. The dual-modified liposomes elevated cellular uptake, downregulated expression of polo-like kinase 1 (PLK-1) and augmented cell apoptosis in prostate tumor cells. The entry of the dual-modified liposomes into 22Rv1 cells occurred via multiple endocytic pathways, including clathrin-mediated endocytosis and macropinocytosis, followed by an effective endosomal escape of the entrapped siRNA into the cytoplasm. In vivo studies conducted on a 22Rv1 xenograft murine model demonstrated that the dual-modified liposomes demonstrated the maximized accumulation, retention and knockdown of PLK-1 in tumor cells, as well as the strongest inhibition of tumor growth and induction of tumor cell apoptosis. In terms of targeting capacity and therapeutic potency, the combination of a PSA-responsive and PSMA-mediated liposome presents a promising platform for therapy and diagnosis of PSMA/PSA-positive PC.""","""['Bai Xiang', 'Da-Wen Dong', 'Nian-Qiu Shi', 'Wei Gao', 'Zhen-Zhen Yang', 'Yi Cui', 'De-Ying Cao', 'Xian-Rong Qi']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Biomaterials""","""['Enhancing siRNA-based cancer therapy using a new pH-responsive activatable cell-penetrating peptide-modified liposomal system.', 'PSMA specific single chain antibody-mediated targeted knockdown of Notch1 inhibits human prostate cancer cell proliferation and tumor growth.', 'A Novel ¹¹¹In-Labeled Anti-Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen Nanobody for Targeted SPECT/CT Imaging of Prostate Cancer.', 'Efficacy Against Human Prostate Cancer by Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen-specific, Transforming Growth Factor-β Insensitive Genetically Targeted CD8+ T-cells Derived from Patients with Metastatic Castrate-resistant Disease.', 'Insight into the heterogeneity of prostate cancer through PSA-PSMA prostate clones: mechanisms and consequences.', 'Nanomedicine in cancer therapy.', 'Cell-Penetrating Peptide-Based Delivery of Macromolecular Drugs: Development, Strategies, and Progress.', 'Overcoming the cellular barriers and beyond: Recent progress on cell penetrating peptide modified nanomedicine in combating physiological and pathological barriers.', 'Multistage pH-responsive codelivery liposomal platform for synergistic cancer therapy.', 'Peptide-Folding Triggered Phase Separation and Lipid Membrane Destabilization in Cholesterol-Rich Lipid Vesicles.']"""

The concept of optoacoustic imaging using home-made functionalized gold nanoparticles coupled to an antibody targeting PSMA (prostate specific membrane antigen) was evaluated on different cancer cell lines to demonstrate the specificity of the designed platform. Two commonly used microscopy techniques (indirect fluorescence and scanning electron microscopy) showed their straightforwardness and versatility for the nanoparticle binding investigations regardless the composition of the investigated nanoobjects. Moreover most of the research laboratories and centers are equipped with fluorescence microscopes, so indirect fluorescence using Quantum dots can be used for any active targeting nanocarriers (polymers, ceramics, metals, etc.). The second technique based on backscattered electron is not only limited to gold nanoparticles but also suits for any study of metallic nanoparticles as the electronic density difference between the nanoparticles and binding surface stays high enough.

Objective:   To investigate the multidrug resistance (MDR) reversal effects and its possible mechanism of R. rubescens extracts on human breast cancer cell line MCF-7/Adr (Michigan Cancer Foundation--7/adriamycin resistance).  Materials and methods:   Rabdosia rubescens were extracted by reflux extraction method with different solvent such as petroleum ether, chloroform, ethyl acetate, n-butyl alcohol and water in order and obtain petroleum ether fraction (PEF), chloroform fraction (CF), ethyl acetate fraction (EAF), n-butyl alcohol fraction (BAF) and aqueous fraction (AF). The active extract fractions of R. rubescens were screened by rhodamine123 (Rh123) accumulation assay. Cytotoxicity of the effect fraction was examined by the MTT assay; the intracellular accumulation of adriamycin and expression of P-gp were examined by flow cytometry; the gene transcription of MDR1 was determined by RT-PCR.  Results:   CF and EAF fractions could increase the intracellular accumulation of adriamycin in MCF-7/Adr cells, PEF, BAF and AF fractions showed little effect on the intracellular accumulation of adriamycin or Rh123. When adriamycin was used in combination with CF and EAF fractions at non-toxic concentration on MCF-7/Adr cells, CF and EAF fractions can reverse MDR of MCF-7/Adr cells, and the reverse folds were 2.16 (CF, 4 μg/mL), 4.60 (CF, 20 μg/mL), 1.87 (EAF, 4 μg/mL) and 4.02 (EAF, 20 μg/mL), respectively. After treatment with CF (4.20 μg/mL) and EAF (4.20 μg/mL) for 48 h, the MDR1 gene expression level in MCF-7/Adr cells was decreased by 40.17, 48.14, 33.86 and 42.52%, and the abundance of P-gp also decreased by 8.63, 24.53, 27.50 and 34.91% in MCF-7/Adr cells, respectively.

Randomized selection from each group assured there would be equal representation for analysis of Hawaiians, Filipinos, Japanese, and Whites and even numbers over all time intervals. Five professionals extracted data from these case records on demographics, type/stage of cancer, diagnosis and treatment dates, barriers, and navigator actions. Clients had breast (30.0%), lung (15.8%), esophageal (6.7%), colon (5.8%), ovarian (4.2%), prostate (3.3%), and other cancers (34.2%). The median number of actions taken on behalf of a client was 4 (range 1-83), and the median number of days a case was open was 14 (range 1-216). High intensity cases (those receiving more assistance over longer periods of time) were more likely than low-intensity cases to need help with education and reassurance, transportation, care coordination, and covering costs. Although there were no demographic differences across intensity groups, Neighbor Island patients from Hawai'i, Maui, Moloka'i, Lana'i and Kaua'i were more likely to need help with arranging travel, care coordination, and costs associated with getting treatment (all at P=.05), and patients on public insurance were more likely to have stage 4 cancer (P=.001) and to need help with costs (P=.006).

In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of selective peripheral approach to lesion biopsies for diagnostic sensitivity of liver masses.  Materials and methods:   Between June 2007 and March 2011, totally 88 patients (50 male, 38 female), referred to our Interventional Radiology Department for sonographically guided Tru-cut biopsies for liver lesions, were examined.All biopsies were performed by an experienced radiologist with an 18-gauge Tru-cut biopsy needle with a spring-loaded biopsy gun under sonographic guidance. We describe two locations (peripheral and central) for liver lesions, with the inner 2/3 part of the mass as central and the outer 1/3 part as peripheral. We obtained biopsy from both of these locations, and samples were transferred to the Pathology Department separately.  Results:   According to pathological and immunohistochemistry studies, there were 42 hepatocellular carcinomas and 46 metastases. All of the metastatic tumors were stained by cytokeratin (10 lung adenocarcinoma, 15 breast adenocarcinoma, 16 gastrointestinal tract, 4 prostate, and 1 malignant melanoma of these 46 metastases were reported as primary). According to histopathological results, diagnostic sensitivity was 97.7% in peripherally located biopsies and 86.3% in biopsies taken from the center of the masses (p=0.0063).

Material and methods:   At out Outpatient Clinic for patients after heart transplantation we analyzed all 324 patients transplanted from 1987-2011 for the presence of malignancies. The end-point of the analysis was determined by malignancy diagnosis, patient death, or end of the observation period (December 12, 2011).  Results:   We detected 31 malignancies in 29 of 324 patients (8.95%). In 2 patients we found 2 types of malignancies. The dominant type of malignancy was pulmonary carcinoma, diagnosed in 11/29 (37.93%) patients. Skin carcinoma was recognized in 7 patients (24.14%). Fourteen (48.3%) patients died (12 men and 2 women): 5 of them in the course of pulmonary carcinoma (35.7%), 3 of skin carcinoma (21.4), 3 in the course of lymphoma, 1 in the course of renal carcinoma, 1 in the course of stomach carcinoma, 1 of colorectal carcinoma, and 1 of prostatic carcinoma.  Conclusions:   The risk of malignancy development is many times higher for HT patients than in the general population.

Having previously demonstrated the importance of the Lin28/let-7/Myc axis in CaP, we tested the hypothesis that Lin28 is overexpressed in CaP and that it activates AR and promotes growth of CaP cells. We analyzed human clinical CaP samples for the expression of Lin28 by quantitative real-time RT-PCR, Western blot analysis, and IHC. Growth characteristics of CaP cell lines transiently and stably expressing Lin28 were examined. The clonogenic ability of CaP cells expressing Lin28 was determined by colony formation and soft agar assays. Increase in expression of AR and subsequent increase in transcription of AR-target genes were analyzed by quantitative real-time RT-PCR, luciferase assays, and ELISA. LNCaP cells stably expressing Lin28 were injected into nude mice, and tumorigenesis was monitored. We found that Lin28 is overexpressed in clinical CaP compared to benign prostates. Overexpression of Lin28 enhanced, while down-regulation reduced, growth of CaP cells. Lin28 enhanced the ability of CaP cells to form colonies in anchorage-dependent and anchorage-independent conditions. LNCaP cells stably expressing Lin28 exhibited significantly higher tumorigenic ability in vivo. Lin28 induced expression of the AR and its target genes such as PSA and NKX3.1.

Cohort mortality studies in PCB-exposed workers reported elevated risks for the following causes of death: liver, stomach, digestive, brain, prostate cancers and non-Hodgkin lymphoma.  Objectives:   The purpose of this study was to update as of December 2006 the mortality experience of two Italian cohorts of workers employed in the manufacture of capacitors impregnated with PCBs.  Methods:   Age-gender-and calendar period adjusted Standardized Mortality Ratios (SMRs) and 95% Confidence Intervals (CI) were calculated using regional rates. Analyses by duration of employment and time since first employment were performed Results: Vital status was ascertained for 98.9% of the study subjects. Mortality from biliary tract cancer among males (SMR 3.91; 95%CI 1.47-10.41), digestive cancer ""not otherwise specified"" in the whole cohort (SMR 2.54; 95%CI 1.21-5.34), and brain cancer in Plant I (SMR 2.13; 95%CI 1.02-4.48), were significantly increased. Increased risks were also observed for Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. No linear associations between mortality and duration of employment or latency were observed for these cancers. Mortality from stomach cancer did not differ from expectation in the whole cohort, however an increasing risk with increasing duration of employment was detected (p for trend=0.02).  Conclusions:   The current update suggests possibly increased cancer risks in PCB-exposed workers, affecting in particular the digestive system, brain, and lymphohemopoietic tissue. However the limited sample size, the lack of clear trends with duration of employment or with latency period, preclude to derive definite conclusions about PCB exposure and the increased cancer risks.""","""['Angela Cecilia Pesatori', 'P Grillo', 'D Consonni', 'M Caironi', 'G Sampietro', 'Leonella Olivari', 'Silvia Ghisleni', 'P A Bertazzi']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Med Lav""","""['Update: cohort mortality study of workers highly exposed to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) during the manufacture of electrical capacitors, 1940-1998.', 'Mortality and exposure response among 14,458 electrical capacitor manufacturing workers exposed to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs).', 'Mortality among workers exposed to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in an electrical capacitor manufacturing plant in Indiana: an update.', 'Weight of evidence evaluation of potential human cancer risks from exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls: an update based on studies published since 2003.', 'Occupational exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls and cancer risk.', 'Mortality in Yusho patients exposed to polychlorinated biphenyls and polychlorinated dibenzofurans: a 50-year retrospective cohort study.', 'Plasma levels of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) and the risk of soft tissue sarcoma.', 'Gut Microbiota Modulates Interactions Between Polychlorinated Biphenyls and Bile Acid Homeostasis.', 'Mortality among capacitor workers exposed to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), a long-term update.', 'Mortality among 24,865 workers exposed to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in three electrical capacitor manufacturing plants: a ten-year update.']"""

In order to determine the accuracy of the verification method used to establish patient position, it is necessary to establish the possible marker migration range during planning and treatment with radiation therapy.  Material and method:   An analysis of the migration of GoldAnchorTM fiducial markers implanted in the prostate conducted on a group of 29 patients treated with image-guided radiation therapy at the Radiotherapy Department of the Cancer Centre and Institute of Oncology in Gliwice. The migration value was determined based on a comparison of the marker's location with the use of spiral computer tomography and cone-beam computer tomography done on the treatment device.  Results:   The average values of the given fiducial marker's migration in the superior-inferior (SI), left-right (LR) and anterior-posterior (AP) directions were: 0.07 cm (SD=0.1 cm); 0.06 cm (SD=0.07 cm) and 0.11 cm (SD=0.11 cm), respectively. The average value of the displacement vector computed according to the Pythagorean theorem and using the Euclidean norm was 0.17 cm with SD= 0.13 cm.  Conclusion:   The analysis indicates that migration of markers implanted in the prostate occurs during radiation treatment planning but probably it is not clinically relevant. Because a correlation was determined between the migration value and the time of carrying out the CT as well as the time that had passed from the implantation to the CBCT examination, it is reasonable to start radiation therapy promptly and to control the marker's location during radiation therapy.""","""['Dawid Bodusz', 'Grzegorz Głowacki', 'Wojciech Leszczyński', 'Wioletta Miśta', 'Leszek Miszczyk']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Przegl Lek""","""['Image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT) for prostate cancer comparing kV imaging of fiducial markers with cone beam computed tomography (CBCT).', 'Registration accuracy and possible migration of internal fiducial gold marker implanted in prostate and liver treated with real-time tumor-tracking radiation therapy (RTRT).', 'Interfractional position variation of pancreatic tumors quantified using intratumoral fiducial markers and daily cone beam computed tomography.', 'Fiducial markers and spacers in prostate radiotherapy: current applications.', 'Image guided radiation therapy for prostate cancer; how, when and why?.', 'CyberKnife-based prostate cancer patient radioablation - early results of irradiation in 200 patients.']"""

We have mapped the 3p13 deletion locus using SNP array analysis and performed fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis to search for associations between 3p13 deletion, prostate cancer phenotype and patient prognosis in a tissue microarray containing more than 3200 prostate cancers. SNP array analysis of 72 prostate cancers revealed a small deletion at 3p13 in 14 (19%) of the tumours, including the putative tumour suppressors FOXP1, RYBP and SHQ1. FISH analysis using FOXP1-specific probes revealed deletions in 16.5% and translocations in 1.2% of 1828 interpretable cancers. 3p13 deletions were linked to adverse features of prostate cancer, including advanced stage (p < 0.0001), high Gleason grade (p = 0.0125), and early PSA recurrence (p = 0.0015). In addition, 3p13 deletions were linked to ERG(+) cancers and to PTEN deletions (p < 0.0001 each). A subset analysis of ERG(+) tumours revealed that 3p13 deletions occurred independently from PTEN deletions (p = 0.3126), identifying tumours with 3p13 deletion as a distinct molecular subset of ERG(+) cancers. mRNA expression analysis confirmed that all 3p13 genes were down regulated by the deletion. Ectopic over-expression of FOXP1, RYBP and SHQ1 resulted in decreased colony-formation capabilities, corroborating a tumour suppressor function for all three genes.

We determined the effects of androgen, cadmium, and arsenic on MT1/2 and MT3 in prostate carcinoma cells, and evaluated the functional effects of MT3 on cell proliferation, invasion, and tumorigenesis.  Methods:   We determined the expression of MT1/2 and MT3 in prostate carcinoma cells by immunoblotting assays or real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reactions. The effects of ectopic MT3 overexpression or MT3-knockdown on cell proliferation, invasion, and tumorigenesis were determined by (3) H-thymidine incorporation, matrigel invasion, and murine xenograft studies. The effects of androgen, cadmium, and arsenic on target genes were assessed using immunoblotting and reporter assays.  Results:   Androgen, cadmium, and arsenic treatments enhanced gene expression of MT1/2 and MT3 in prostate carcinoma LNCaP cells. Results of immunohistochemical staining indicated MT3 overexpression was found predominantly in the nuclear areas of PC-3 cells overexpressing MT3. Overexpression of MT3 significantly increased cell proliferation, invasion, and tumorigenic activities in PC-3 cells in vitro and in vivo. MT3 overexpression downregulated the gene expressions of N-myc downstream regulated gene 1 (Ndrg1) and maspin, and attenuated blocking effects of doxorubicin in PC-3 cells on cell proliferation. MT3-knockdown enhanced Ndrg1 and maspin expressions in LNCaP cells.  Conclusions:   The experiments indicate that MT3 is an androgen-upregulated gene, and promotes tumorigenesis of prostate carcinoma cells.

Methods:   The subjects were 87 patients with low-risk prostate cancer who were under AS between 2000 and 2010. The eligibility criteria for AS were T1c, Gleason score ≤ 6, prostate-specific antigen level ≤ 10 ng/ml, one or two positive biopsies, maximum cancer involvement ≤ 50 %, and age ≤ 80 years old.  Results:   Of the 87 patients, 48 underwent the first surveillance biopsy (55.2 %). In this biopsy, no cancer was found in 33.3 % of cases, 27.1 % remained eligible for AS, and 39.6 % did not meet the AS criteria (up-grade 22.9 %, up-volume 16.7 %). A second surveillance-biopsy was performed at 1.9 years after the first biopsy. No cancer was found in 20.0 % of cases, 40.0 % remained eligible for AS, and 40.0 % did not meet the AS criteria (up-grade 26.7 %, up-volume 13.3 %). A total of 50 patients received treatment by 1.7 years after starting AS, mainly due to an up-grade or up-volume. However, some patients underwent radiotherapy despite biopsy results indicating no cancer or eligibility for AS. The active treatment-free survival rate was 64.1 % after 2 years.  Conclusions:   Surveillance biopsy is important for identifying patients who require active treatment. The results in this study allowed determination of the active treatment-free survival rate and are informative for making treatment decisions.""","""['Katsuyoshi Hashine', 'Hiroyuki Iio', 'Yoshiteru Ueno', 'Shohei Tsukimori', 'Iku Ninomiya']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Int J Clin Oncol""","""['Pathological upgrading and up staging with immediate repeat biopsy in patients eligible for active surveillance.', 'Biopsy features associated with prostate cancer progression in active surveillance patients: comparison of three statistical models.', 'Role of immediate confirmatory prostate biopsy to ensure accurate eligibility for active surveillance.', 'Prostate biopsy: who, how and when.

A significant number of tumors advance to a highly invasive and metastatic stage, which is typically resistant to traditional cancer therapeutics. In order to identify chromosomal structural variants that may contribute to prostate cancer progression we sequenced the genomes of a HPV-18 immortalized nonmalignant human prostate epithelial cell line, RWPE1, and compared it to its malignant, metastatic derivative, WPE1-NB26. There were a total of 34 large (> 1 Mbp) and 38 small copy number variants (<100 kbp) in WPE1-NB26 that were not present in the precursor cell line. We also identified and validated 46 structural variants present in the two cell lines, of which 23 were unique to WPE1-NB26. Structural variants unique to the malignant cell line inactivated: (1) the neurofibromin2 (NF2) gene, a known tumor suppressor; (2) its neighboring gene NIPSNAP1, another putative tumor suppressor that inhibits TRPV6, an anti-apoptotic oncogene implicated in prostate cancer progression; (3) UGT2B17, a gene that inactivates dihydrotestosterone, a known activator of prostate cancer progression; and (4) LPIN2, a phosphatidic acid phosphatase and a co-factor of PGC1a that is important for lipid metabolism and for suppressing autoinflammation.

Here, we showed that PCa cells could recruit BM-MSCs and consequently the metastatic ability of PCa cells was increased. We also found that the increased metastatic ability of PCa cells could be due to the increased PCa stem cell population. Mechanism dissection studies found that the upregulation of Chemokine ligand 5 (CCL5) expression in BM-MSCs and PCa cells, after MSCs infiltrated into the PCa cells, subsequently downregulated androgen receptor (AR) signaling, which was due to inhibition of AR nuclear translocation. Interruption of such signaling led to suppression of the BM-MSCs-induced PCa stem cell population increase and thereby inhibited the metastatic ability of PCa cells. The PCa stem cell increase then led to the upregulation of matrix metalloproteinase 9, ZEB-1, CD133 and CXCR4 molecules, and enhanced the metastatic ability of PCa cells. Therefore, we conclude that the BM-MSCs-mediated increased metastatic ability of PCa cells can be due to the PCa stem cell increase via alteration of the CCL5-AR signaling pathway. Together, these results uncover the important roles of BM-MSCs as key components in the prostate tumor microenvironment to promote PCa metastasis and may provide a new potential target to suppress PCa metastasis by blocking BM-MSCs infiltration into PCa.""","""['J Luo', 'S Ok Lee', 'L Liang', 'C-K Huang', 'L Li', 'S Wen', 'C Chang']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['Infiltrating bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) increase prostate cancer cell invasion via altering the CCL5/HIF2α/androgen receptor signals.', 'BM-MSCs promote prostate cancer progression via the conversion of normal fibroblasts to cancer-associated fibroblasts.', 'Autocrine CCL5 signaling promotes invasion and migration of CD133+ ovarian cancer stem-like cells via NF-κB-mediated MMP-9 upregulation.', 'Androgen receptor and prostate cancer stem cells: biological mechanisms and clinical implications.', 'Cancer stem cell and mesenchymal cell cooperative actions in metastasis progression and hormone resistance in prostate cancer: Potential role of androgen and gonadotropin‑releasing hormone receptors (Review).', 'Cranial Neural Crest Cells Contribution to Craniofacial Bone Development and Regeneration.', 'Osteoid cell-derived chemokines drive bone-metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Identification of molecularly unique tumor-associated mesenchymal stromal cells in breast cancer patients.', 'The role of tumor microenvironment reprogramming in primary liver cancer chemotherapy resistance.', 'Tumor-targeted miRNA nanomedicine for overcoming challenges in immunity and therapeutic resistance.']"""

Accordingly, stromal cells do not equally promote PCa in older males and younger males. Therefore, it is also possible that the expression of androgen receptors (ARs) by prostatic stromal cells in older versus younger males plays different roles in PCa progression. Using a gene knockdown technique and coculture system, we found that the knockdown of the AR in prostatic stromal cells obtained from younger males could promote the invasiveness and metastasis of cocultured PC3/LNCaP cells in vitro. By contrast, the invasiveness and metastasis of LNCaP cells was inhibited when cocultured with prostatic stromal cells from older males that when AR expression was knocked down. Moreover, after targeting AR expression with small hairpin RNA (shRNA), matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) expression in stromal cells was observed to increase in the younger group, but decreased or remained unchanged in the older group. One exception, however, was observed with MMP9. In vivo, after knocking down AR expression in prostatic stromal cells, the incidence of metastatic lymph nodes was observed to increase in the younger age group, but decreased in the older age group. Together, these data suggest that the AR in prostatic stromal cells played opposite roles in PCa metastasis for older versus younger males. Therefore, collectively, the function of the AR in prostatic stromal cells appears to change with age, and this may account for the increased incidence of PCa in older males.""","""['You-Yi Lu', 'Bo Jiang', 'Fu-Jun Zhao', 'Di Cui', 'Qi Jiang', 'Jun-Jie Yu', 'En-Hui Li', 'Xiao-Hai Wang', 'Bang-Min Han', 'Shu-Jie Xia']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Asian J Androl""","""['Aging up-regulates ARA55 in stromal cells, inducing androgen-mediated prostate cancer cell proliferation and migration.', 'Androgen receptor and invasion in prostate cancer.', 'Infiltrating T cells promote prostate cancer metastasis via modulation of FGF11→miRNA-541→androgen receptor (AR)→MMP9 signaling.', 'Stromal androgen receptor roles in the development of normal prostate, benign prostate hyperplasia, and prostate cancer.', 'Stromal androgen receptor in prostate development and cancer.', 'Aging up-regulates ARA55 in stromal cells, inducing androgen-mediated prostate cancer cell proliferation and migration.']"""

No other patient had clonal aberrations, but this patient showed ring chromosomes in the range of 21-25% of lymphocytes. He received 5 cycles of 5-fluorouracil/folic acid for chemotherapy of sigmoid colon carcinoma in 2003, three years before radiotherapy of prostate cancer. Blood samples were irradiated ex vivo with Cs-137 γ-rays (0.7Gy/min) in the G0-phase of the cell cycle. 100 FISH painted metaphases were analysed for the control and the irradiated samples each. Multicolour in situ hybridisation techniques like mFISH and mBand as well as MYC locus, telomere and centromere painting probes were used to characterise ring metaphases. Metaphase search and autocapture was performed with a Zeiss Axioplan 2 imaging microscope followed by scoring and image analysis using Metafer 4/ISIS software (MetaSystems). In 2009 chromosome 8 rings were found in about 25% of lymphocytes. Rings were stable over time and increased to about 30% until 2012. The ring chromosome 8 always lacked telomere signals and a small amount of rings displayed up to four centromere signals. In aberrant metaphases 8pter and 8qter were either translocated or deleted. Further analyses revealed that the breakpoint at the p arm is localised at 8p21.2-22. The breakpoint at the q arm turned out to be distal from the MYC locus at 8q23-24. We hypothesise that the ring chromosome 8 has been developed during the 5 FU/folic acid treatments in 2003.

The prostate cancer detection rate of systematic 12-core transrectal ultrasound guided biopsy is between 30% and 40%. For prostates greater than 40 cc this decreases to 30% or less. Magnetic resonance-ultrasound fusion biopsy has shown superior prostate cancer detection rates. We defined the detection rate of magnetic resonance-ultrasound fusion biopsy in men with an enlarged prostate gland.  Materials and methods:   We retrospectively analyzed the records of patients who underwent multiparametric prostate magnetic resonance imaging followed by magnetic resonance-ultrasound fusion biopsy at our institution. Whole prostate volumes were calculated using magnetic resonance imaging reconstructions. Detection rates were analyzed with respect to age, prostate specific antigen and whole prostate volumes. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess these parameters as independent predictors of prostate cancer detection.  Results:   We analyzed 649 patients with a mean±SD age of 61.8±7.9 years and a median prostate specific antigen of 6.65 ng/ml (IQR 4.35-11.0). Mean whole prostate volume was 58.7±34.3 cc. The overall detection rate of the magnetic resonance-ultrasound fusion platform was 55%. For prostates less than 40 cc the detection rate was 71.1% compared to 57.5%, 46.9%, 46.9% 33.3%, 36.4% and 30.4% for glands 40 to 54.9, 55 to 69.9, 70 to 84.9, 85 to 99.9, 100 to 114.9 and 115 cc or greater, respectively (p<0.0001). Multivariable logistic regression showed a significant inverse association of magnetic resonance imaging volume with prostate cancer detection, controlling for age and prostate specific antigen.  Conclusions:   Transrectal ultrasound guided and fusion biopsy cancer detection rates decreased with increasing prostate volume.

Blocking αv integrins may be an effective strategy for inhibiting prostate cancer (PCa) metastasis.  Objective:   Evaluate EMD 525797 safety/tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK) in castration-resistant PCa patients. Secondary objectives included antitumor activity assessments.  Design, setting, and participants:   A phase 1 open-label study in 26 patients (four European centers). Eligible patients (≥ 18 yr) had histologically proven PCa with bone metastases after prior chemotherapy and evidence of progressive disease (PD) based on prostate-specific antigen (PSA) values.  Intervention:   Patients received three intravenous EMD 525797 infusions (250, 500, 1000, or 1500 mg every 2 wk).  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were assessed. PK parameters were calculated according to noncompartmental standard methods. Antitumor activity measures were response after 6 wk, changes in PSA levels, and pain interference total score. Descriptive statistics were used.  Results and limitations:   Patients were treated for a mean of 16.8 ± 16.7 wk. No DLTs were reported in any of the cohorts. All patients experienced TEAEs, which were considered drug-related in 11 patients. Four deaths occurred during the trial and were considered not related to EMD 525797. EMD 525797 showed dose-dependent, nonlinear PK. Eighteen of 26 patients did not show PD for ≥ 18 wk. Two patients (500-mg cohort), treated for 42.4 and 76.3 wk, had clinically significant PSA reductions and pain relief, including one patient with confirmed partial response. This trial was not specifically designed to assess clinical activity, and further investigations are needed in randomized controlled trials.  Conclusions:   No DLTs were reported in any of the evaluated cohorts. There was evidence of clinical activity. For the currently ongoing phase 2 trial, EMD 525797 doses of 750 and 1500 mg every 3 wk were chosen.

To this end, radiation therapy (RT) induced DNA double-strand-breaks and the resulting chromosomal damage were assessed in peripheral blood T-lymphocytes of prostate cancer (PCa) patients applying γH2AX foci and G0 micronucleus (MN) assays.  Methods and materials:   The study comprised 33PCa patients. A blood sample was taken before start of therapy and after the 1st and 3rd RT fraction to determine respectively the RT-induced γH2AX foci and MN. The equivalent total body dose (D(ETB)) was calculated based on treatment planning data.  Results:   A linear dose response was obtained for γH2AX foci yields versus D(ETB) while MN showed a linear-quadratic dose response. Patients treated with large volume (LV) VMAT show a significantly higher level of induced γH2AX foci and MN compared to IMRT and small volume (SV) VMAT (p<0.01). Assuming a linear-quadratic relationship, a satisfactory correlation was found between both endpoints (R(2) 0.86).

Despite extensive research on blood perfusion imaging aimed at angiogenesis detection, the diagnosis of prostate cancer still requires systematic biopsies. This may be due to the complex relationship between angiogenesis and microvascular perfusion. Analysis of ultrasound-contrast-agent dispersion kinetics, determined by multipath trajectories in the microcirculation, may provide better characterization of the microvascular architecture. We propose the physical rationale for dispersion estimation by an existing spatiotemporal similarity analysis. After an intravenous ultrasound-contrast-agent bolus injection, dispersion is estimated by coherence analysis among time-intensity curves measured at neighbor pixels. The accuracy of the method is increased by time-domain windowing and anisotropic spatial filtering for speckle regularization. The results in 12 patient data sets indicated superior agreement with histology (receiver operating characteristic curve area = 0.88) compared with those obtained by reported perfusion and dispersion analyses, providing a valuable contribution to prostate cancer localization.""","""['M P J Kuenen', 'T A Saidov', 'H Wijkstra', 'M Mischi']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Ultrasound Med Biol""","""['Angiogenesis imaging by spatiotemporal analysis of ultrasound contrast agent dispersion kinetics.', 'Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound Angiogenesis Imaging by Mutual Information Analysis for Prostate Cancer Localization.', 'Spatiotemporal correlation of ultrasound contrast agent dilution curves for angiogenesis localization by dispersion imaging.', 'An EFSUMB introduction into Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound (DCE-US) for quantification of tumour perfusion.', 'Quantitative evaluation of microvascular blood flow by contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS).', 'Clinical Trial Protocol: Developing an Image Classification Algorithm for Prostate Cancer Diagnosis on Three-dimensional Multiparametric Transrectal Ultrasound.', 'The evolving role of contrast-enhanced ultrasound in urology: a review.', 'The unique second wave phenomenon in contrast enhanced ultrasound imaging with nanobubbles.', 'Interpretable Machine Learning for Characterization of Focal Liver Lesions by Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound.', 'Automated multiparametric localization of prostate cancer based on B-mode, shear-wave elastography, and contrast-enhanced ultrasound radiomics.']"""

Methods:   Between March 2005 and April 2007, 109 patients with a prostate volume of less than 60 mL were recruited and randomized to treatment: 57 underwent holmium laser ablation of the prostate (HOLAP) and 52 underwent photoselective vaporization of the prostate (PVP) using an 80-W potassium titanyl phosphate laser. The changes in subjective (International Prostate Symptom Score quality of life and International Index of Erectile Function-15) and objective (postvoid residual urine maximal flow rate) outcome parameters were compared. The long-term outcome, timing, and predictors of negative outcome were assessed. Cost analysis was included.  Results:   After a median of 71.3 months, significant comparable improvement was documented in all subjective and objective urinary parameters from baseline measures at different points of follow-up. Retreatment for infravesical obstruction was 19.2% in HOLAP and 25% in PVP (P >.05). Smaller prostate volume was significantly associated with bladder neck contracture (BNC) after laser ablation, regardless the type of laser used. BNC and de novo urethral stricture seem to be the main causes for an early (first-year) reintervention. Redo treatment for recurring prostate adenoma was associated with less postoperative prostate-specific antigen reduction (<20%). Procedure costs were CaD $200.45 higher in the PVP group (P >.05).  Conclusion:   PVP and HOLAP seem to be equally effective and safe, with similar long-term outcome data, including cost. Regardless the laser wavelength, at least 1 of 5 patients will need retreatment. BNC is a more prevalent cause of early retreatment in smaller glands with both lasers.

The model is capable of simulating demand at the local level. This article investigates the local and regional level variation in predicted demand with respect to Breast and Prostate cancer, the two tumour types responsible for the majority of radiotherapy treatment workload in England.  Materials and methods:   Simulations were performed using the Malthus model, using base population incidence data for the period from 2007-2009. Simulations were carried out at the level of Primary Care Trusts, Cancer Networks, and nationwide, with annual projections for 2012, 2016 and 2020. Benchmarking was undertaken against previously published models from the UK, Canada and Australia.  Results:   For breast cancer, the fraction burden for 2012 varied from 5537 fractions per million in Tower Hamlets PCT to 18 896 fractions per million in Devon PCT (national mean - 13 592 fractions per million). For prostate cancer, the fraction burden for 2012 varied from 4874 fractions per million in Tower Hamlets PCT to 23 181 fractions per million in Lincolnshire PCT (national mean - 15 087 fractions per million). Predictions of population growth by age cohort for 2016 and 2020 result in the regional differences in radiotherapy demand becoming greater over time.

Methods and materials:   Twelve men enrolled and completed a phase 1 single-institution trial between 2006 and 2010. Eligibility required a previously untreated diagnosis of localized but high-risk prostate cancer. Median follow-up was 46 months (range, 14-74 months). Radiation therapy was dose-escalated in a 3 × 3 design with dose levels of 39.6, 45, 50.4, and 54 Gy. The pelvic lymph nodes were treated up to 45 Gy with any additional dose given to the prostate and seminal vesicles. Radical prostatectomy was performed 4-8 weeks after RT completion. Primary outcome measure was intraoperative and postoperative day-30 morbidity. Secondary measures included late morbidity and oncologic outcomes.  Results:   No intraoperative morbidity was seen. Chronic urinary grade 2+ toxicity occurred in 42%; 2 patients (17%) developed a symptomatic urethral stricture requiring dilation. Two-year actuarial biochemical recurrence-free survival was 67% (95% confidence interval 34%-86%). Patients with pT3 or positive surgical margin treated with neoadjuvant RT had a trend for improved biochemical recurrence-free survival compared with a historical cohort with similar adverse factors.  Conclusions:   Neoadjuvant RT is feasible with moderate urinary morbidity. However, oncologic outcomes do not seem to be substantially different from those with selective postoperative RT.

Accordingly, we examined the expression of TLR7 during tumour progression of TRMAP (transgenic mouse model for prostate cancer) mice and its role on cell growth.  Method of study:   Toll-like receptor7 expression was examined by RT-polymerase chain reaction (PCR), Western blot, and immunohistochemistry. Cell growth was examined by MTT assay. Colony formation was investigated by crystal violet staining.  Results:   Strong expression of TLR7 was detected in the normal prostate epithelia of Wild-type (WT) mice, but not in TLR7-deficient mice. In contrast, TLR7 expression was weak in transgenic adenocarcinoma of mouse prostate (TRAMP)-C2 cells, as compared with murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs). Moreover, TLR7 mRNA was markedly expressed in RWPE-1 cells (non-cancerous prostate epithelial cells), but not in PC3 and DU145 (prostate cancer cells). Immunohistochemically, TLR7 expression gradually decreased in TRAMP mice depending on the pathologic grade of the prostate cells. TLR7 agonists increased both the gene and protein expression of TLR7 and promoted production of proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines and IFN-β gene expression in prostate cancer cell lines. Moreover, loxoribine inhibited the growth and colony formation of TRAMP-C2 cells dependent of TLR7.

Therefore, an explanation of this difference is lacking. Serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is a valuable marker used to select patients who should undergo prostate biopsies, although the manner in which it is used may require adjustments based on the ethnic population in question. We investigated racial differences in the PCa detection rate between Canadian and Saudi populations. A retrospective analysis was performed of data collected prospectively over 5 consecutive years in urology clinics at the McGill University Health Center (MUHC) and King Saud University Hospital (KSUH). Men who had high (>4'ng/mL) or rising PSA levels and a negative digital rectal examination were eligible. A total of 1403 Canadian and 414 Saudi patients were evaluated for the study; 717 and 158 men, median age 64 and 68 years, were included in the MUHC and KSUH cohorts, respectively, P<0.0001).

CIMP has been reported to be useful for predicting prognosis and response to treatment in a variety of tumor types, but it remains unclear whether or not CIMP is a universal phenomenon across human neoplasia or if there should be cancer-specific definitions of the phenotype. Recently, it was shown that somatic isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 (IDH1) mutations, frequently observed in gliomas, establish CIMP in primary human astrocytes by remodeling the methylome. Interestingly, somatic IDH1 and IDH2 mutations, and loss-of-function mutations in ten-eleven translocation (TET) methylcytosine dioxygenase-2 (TET2) associated with a hypermethylation phenotype, are also found in multiple enchondromas of patients with Ollier disease and Mafucci syndrome, and leukemia, respectively. These data provide the first clues for the elucidation of a molecular basis for CIMP. Although CIMP appears as a phenomenon that occurs in various cancer types, the definition is poorly defined and differs for each tumor.

Thus, there remains a strong rationale to suppress AR activity as the single most important therapeutic goal in CRPC treatment. Although the expression of ligand-independent AR splice variants confers resistance to AR-targeted therapy and progression to lethal castrate-resistant cancer, the molecular regulators of AR activity in CRPC remain unclear, in particular those pathways that potentiate the function of mutant AR in CRPC. Here, we identify FHL2 as a novel coactivator of ligand-independent AR variants that are important in CRPC. We show that the nuclear localization of FHL2 and coactivation of the AR is driven by calpain cleavage of the cytoskeletal protein filamin, a pathway that shows differential activation in prostate epithelial versus prostate cancer cell lines. We further identify a novel FHL2-AR-filamin transcription complex, revealing how deregulation of this axis promotes the constitutive, ligand-independent activation of AR variants, which are present in CRPC. Critically, the calpain-cleaved filamin fragment and FHL2 are present in the nucleus only in CRPC and not benign prostate tissue or localized prostate cancer. Thus, our work provides mechanistic insight into the enhanced AR activation, most notably of the recently identified AR variants, including AR-V7 that drives CRPC progression. Furthermore, our results identify the first disease-specific mechanism for deregulation of FHL2 nuclear localization during cancer progression. These results offer general import beyond prostate cancer, given that nuclear FHL2 is characteristic of other human cancers where oncogenic transcription factors that drive disease are activated like the AR in prostate cancer.""","""['Meagan J McGrath', 'Lauren C Binge', 'Absorn Sriratana', 'Hong Wang', 'Paul A Robinson', 'David Pook', 'Clare G Fedele', 'Susan Brown', 'Jennifer M Dyson', 'Denny L Cottle', 'Belinda S Cowling', 'Birunthi Niranjan', 'Gail P Risbridger', 'Christina A Mitchell']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Cancer Res""","""['Transcription of Nrdp1 by the androgen receptor is regulated by nuclear filamin A in prostate cancer.', 'Nucleoporin 62 and Ca(2+)/calmodulin dependent kinase kinase 2 regulate androgen receptor activity in castrate resistant prostate cancer cells.', 'Androgen induction of the androgen receptor coactivator four and a half LIM domain protein-2: evidence for a role for serum response factor in prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'The concept and mechanisms of castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Cellular specificity of androgen receptor, coregulators, and pioneer factors in prostate cancer.', 'The Crucial Role of AR-V7 in Enzalutamide-Resistance of Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'How (Epi)Genetic Regulation of the LIM-Domain Protein FHL2 Impacts Multifactorial Disease.', 'ARVib suppresses growth of advanced prostate cancer via inhibition of androgen receptor signaling.', 'INPP4B promotes PI3Kα-dependent late endosome formation and Wnt/β-catenin signaling in breast cancer.']"""

The downregulation of ARHI was regulated by miR-221 in prostate cancer cell lines. However, it has not been reported whether ARHI is regulated by miR-221 in breast cancer. Here, we reported that the ARHI protein level was downregulated in breast cancer tissues and breast cancer cell lines. The overexpression of ARHI could inhibit cell proliferation and invasion and induce cell apoptosis. To address whether ARHI is regulated by miR-221 in breast cancer cell lines, the results in this study showed that a significant inverse correlation existed between ARHI and miR-221. MiR-221 displayed an upregulation in breast cancer tissues and breast cancer cell lines. The inhibition of miR-221 induced a significant upregulation of ARHI in MCF-7 cells. To prove a direct interaction between miR-221 and ARHI mRNA, ARHI 3'UTR, which includes the potential target site for miR-221, was cloned downstream of the luciferase reporter gene of the pMIR-REPORT vector to generate the pMIR-ARHI-3'UTR vector. The results confirmed a direct interaction of miR-221 with a target site on the 3'UTR of ARHI. In conclusion, ARHI is a tumor suppressor gene that is downregulated in breast cancer.

We estimated inorganic arsenic exposure as the sum of inorganic and methylated species in urine. Cancer deaths (386 overall, 78 lung, 34 liver, 18 prostate, 26 kidney, 24 esophagus/stomach, 25 pancreas, 32 colon/rectal, 26 breast, and 40 lymphatic/hematopoietic) were assessed by mortality surveillance reviews.

Results:   Median (interquartile range) urine concentration for inorganic plus methylated arsenic species was 9.7 (5.8-15.6) μg/g creatinine. The adjusted HRs [95% confidence interval (CI)] comparing the 80th versus 20th percentiles of arsenic were 1.14 (0.92-1.41) for overall cancer, 1.56 (1.02-2.39) for lung cancer, 1.34 (0.66, 2.72) for liver cancer, 3.30 (1.28-8.48) for prostate cancer, and 0.44 (0.14, 1.14) for kidney cancer. The corresponding hazard ratios were 2.46 (1.09-5.58) for pancreatic cancer, and 0.46 (0.22-0.96) for lymphatic and hematopoietic cancers. Arsenic was not associated with cancers of the esophagus and stomach, colon and rectum, and breast.  Conclusions:   Low to moderate exposure to inorganic arsenic was prospectively associated with increased mortality for cancers of the lung, prostate, and pancreas.

A retrospective analysis was made of patient age and gender, clinical characteristics of metastatic lesions, location of the primary tumor, and time elapsed from diagnosis to the death of a patient.  Results:   There were 13 male and 3 female patients (mean age, 58.8 years).

Conditional survival can provide relevant information for cancer survivors, their family and oncologists.  Methods:   We used the period approach to estimate the latest 10-year survival of 38,439 patients with stomach, colorectal, lung, breast and prostate cancer diagnosed between 1990 and 2004 and followed-up from 2000-04 in Osaka, Japan. Conditional survival is an estimate, with the pre-condition of having already survived a certain length of time. Conditional five-year relative survival of one to five years after diagnosis was calculated by site, age and stage for survivors under the age of 70.  Results:   Five-year relative survival for stomach cancer was 60%. Conditional five-year relative survival was 77% one year after diagnosis and 97% five years after diagnosis. This means that 97% of patients who survive five years after diagnosis can survive a further five years. Conditional five-year relative survival improved successively with each additional year that patients lived after diagnosis for stomach, colorectal and lung cancer. These figures for breast and prostate cancer were stable at high survival. Liver cancer did not show an increase in conditional five-year survival.

Methods:   For 20 cancer sites, 5-year cancer prevalence, incidence, and survival were observed and age standardised for the mid 2000s in the United States, Nordic European Countries, Italy, Australia, and France.  Results:   In Italy, 5-year crude prevalence for all cancers was 1.9% in men and 1.7% in women, while it was ∼1.5% in all other countries and sexes. After adjustment for the different age distribution of the populations, cancer prevalence in the United States was higher (20% in men and 10% in women) than elsewhere. For all cancers combined, the geographic heterogeneities were limited, though relevant for specific cancers (e.g., prostate, showing >30% higher prevalence in the United States, or lung, showing >50% higher prevalence in USA women than in other countries).

Many men are tested without this discussion. Prostate cancer screening decision aids increase patient knowledge and participation in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing decisions under ideal circumstances but are often resource intensive and elaborate. There is a need for evaluation of interventions that are low cost, low literacy, and practical for widespread distribution. The authors evaluated the effect of a mailed low-literacy informational patient flyer about the PSA test on measures of shared decision making.  Methods:   A pragmatic randomized controlled trial comparing the mailed flyer versus usual care was conducted among 303 men aged 50 to 74 years who were scheduled for annual health maintenance exams in 2 general internal medicine clinics (University of Colorado and University of Colorado Hospital). Charts were reviewed after the visits for documentation of PSA screening discussions and PSA testing rates. Follow-up patient surveys assessed include perceived participation in PSA screening decisions, knowledge of the PSA test, and flyer acceptability.  Results:   Rates of chart-documented PSA discussions were low with no difference between the flyer and control groups (17.7% and 13.6%, respectively; P = .28). Rates of PSA testing were also similar in both groups (62.5% vs 58.5%; P = .48). Rates of patient-reported PSA discussions were higher than the documented rates but also without differences between the groups (71.8% vs 62.3%; P = .22). The intervention had no effect in the PSA knowledge scores (3.5/5 vs 3.3/5, P = .60). Patients found the flyer to be highly acceptable.  Conclusions:   A mailed low-literacy informational flyer was well received by patients but had no effect on rates of PSA discussions, PSA testing, or patient knowledge of prostate cancer screening.""","""['Alison R Landrey', 'Daniel D Matlock', 'Laura Andrews', 'Michael Bronsert', 'Tom Denberg']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Prim Care Community Health""","""['A patient recall program to enhance decisions about prostate cancer screening: a feasibility study.', 'National evidence on the use of shared decision making in prostate-specific antigen screening.', 'Do Men Receive Information Required for Shared Decision Making About PSA Testing?

MicroRNAs, being important regulators of gene expression, are promising biomarkers in various cancer entities, though the impact as prognostic predictors in PCa is poorly understood. The aim of this study was to identify specific miRNAs as potential prognostic markers in high-risk PCa and to validate their clinical impact.  Methodology and principal findings:   We performed miRNA-microarray analysis in a high-risk PCa study group selected by their clinical outcome (clinical progression free survival (CPFS) vs. clinical failure (CF)). We identified seven candidate miRNAs (let-7a/b/c, miR-515-3p/5p, -181b, -146b, and -361) that showed differential expression between both groups. Further qRT-PCR analysis revealed down-regulation of members of the let-7 family in the majority of a large, well-characterized high-risk PCa cohort (n = 98). Expression of let-7a/b/and -c was correlated to clinical outcome parameters of this group. While let-7a showed no association or correlation with clinical relevant data, let-7b and let-7c were associated with CF in PCa patients and functioned partially as independent prognostic marker. Validation of the data using an independent high-risk study cohort revealed that let-7b, but not let-7c, has impact as an independent prognostic marker for BCR and CF. Furthermore, we identified HMGA1, a non-histone protein, as a new target of let-7b and found correlation of let-7b down-regulation with HMGA1 over-expression in primary PCa samples.  Conclusion:   Our findings define a distinct miRNA expression profile in PCa cases with early CF and identified let-7b as prognostic biomarker in high-risk PCa. This study highlights the importance of let-7b as tumor suppressor miRNA in high-risk PCa and presents a basis to improve individual therapy for high-risk PCa patients.""","""['Maria Schubert', 'Martin Spahn', 'Susanne Kneitz', 'Claus Jürgen Scholz', 'Steven Joniau', 'Philipp Stroebel', 'Hubertus Riedmiller', 'Burkhard Kneitz']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['A TMEFF2-regulated cell cycle derived gene signature is prognostic of recurrence risk in prostate cancer.', 'The association of let-7c, miR-21, miR-145, miR-182, and miR-221 with clinicopathologic parameters of prostate cancer in patients diagnosed with low-risk disease.', 'Meta-analysis of miRNA expression profiles for prostate cancer recurrence following radical prostatectomy.', 'The potential of microRNAs as human prostate cancer biomarkers: A meta-analysis of related studies.', 'Primary tumor microRNA signature predicts recurrence and survival in patients with locally advanced esophageal adenocarcinoma.', 'MicroRNA analysis of Natural Killer cell-derived exosomes: the microRNA let-7b-5p is enriched in exosomes and participates in their anti-tumor effects against pancreatic cancer cells.', 'miRNA in Molecular Diagnostics.', 'IL-36β promotes anti-tumor effects in CD8+ T cells by downregulating micro-RNA let-7c-5p.', 'The Metabolism Reprogramming of microRNA Let-7-Mediated Glycolysis Contributes to Autophagy and Tumor Progression.', 'Regulation of Neuroendocrine-like Differentiation in Prostate Cancer by Non-Coding RNAs.']"""

They result from loss of heterozygosity (LOH) for the PTEN gene on chromosome 10q23. Previous studies reported that various drugs, chemicals, and foods can up-regulate PTEN mRNA and protein expression in different cell lines, and they may be useful in the future prevention and/or treatment of these cancers. PTEN has also been observed to have prognostic significance and is gradually being accepted as an independent prognostic factor. This will help in monitoring disease progression and/or recurrence, with a view to improving treatment outcomes and reducing the associated morbidity and mortality from these cancers. Neprilysin (NEP) is a zinc-dependent metallopeptidase that cleaves and inactivates some biologically active peptides thus switching off signal transduction at the cell surface. Decreased NEP expression in many cancers has been reported. NEP can form a complex with PTEN and enhance PTEN recruitment to the plasma membrane as well as stabilize its phosphatase activity. MicroRNA-21 (miR-21) post-transcriptionally down-regulates the expression of PTEN and stimulates growth and invasion in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (lung Ca), suggesting that this may be a potential therapeutic target in the future treatment of NSCLC.

The treatment margins estimated for the first 1, 2, 3 and 5 min were compared with those for the regular IMRT treatment to quantify the reduction of the motion. If the treatment can be completed within 5 (3) min, the standard deviation of the prostate displacement could be reduced by up to 45% and the required treatment margins could be reduced to 1.2 (1.1), 0.9 (0.8), 2.2 (1.9), 1.9 (1.5), 1.9 (1.7) and 2.8 (2.4) mm from 1.5, 1.1, 2.8, 3.0, 2.4 and 3.9 mm in the left, right, superior, inferior, anterior and posterior directions, respectively.

Previous work has shown that there is reciprocal feedback regulation of PI3K and AR signaling in PCa, suggesting that cotargeting both pathways may enhance therapeutic efficacy. Here we show that proteins encoded by two androgen-regulated genes, kallikrein related peptidase 4 (KLK4) and promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF), integrate optimal functioning of AR and mTOR signaling in PCa cells. KLK4 interacts with PLZF and decreases its stability. PLZF in turn interacts with AR and inhibits its function as a transcription factor. PLZF also activates expression of regulated in development and DNA damage responses 1, an inhibitor of mTORC1. Thus, a unique molecular switch is generated that regulates both AR and PI3K signaling. Consistently, KLK4 knockdown results in a significant decline in PCa cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo, decreases anchorage-independent growth, induces apoptosis, and dramatically sensitizes PCa cells to apoptosis-inducing agents. Furthermore, in vivo nanoliposomal KLK4 siRNA delivery in mice bearing PCa tumors results in profound remission.

However, results after external beam radiotherapy have improved significantly through dose escalation and the use of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). This report describes long-term findings after low-dose (< 75.6 Gy) or high-dose (≥ 75.6 Gy) external beam radiation, with or without ADT.  Methods:   This analysis included 741 men with high-risk prostate cancer (clinical classification ≥ T3, Gleason score ≥ 8, or prostate-specific antigen level ≥ 20 ng/mL) treated with external beam radiotherapy at a single tertiary institution from 1987 through 2004. The radiation dose ranged from 60 to 79.3 Gy (median, 70 Gy); 295 men had received ADT for ≥ 2 years, and the median follow-up time was 8.3 years.  Results:   The 5- and 10-year actuarial overall survival rates were significantly better for men treated with the higher radiation dose (no ADT plus ≥ 75.6 Gy, 87.3% and 72.0%, respectively; and ADT plus ≥ 75.6 Gy, 92.3% and 72%, respectively) (P = .0035). The corresponding 5- and 10-year biochemical failure-free survival rates were significantly better for patients treated with both ADT and higher radiation dose (82% and 77%, P < .0001). At 5 years, men who had not received ADT and had received radiation dose < 75.6 Gy had higher clinical local failure rates than those given ADT and radiation dose ≥ 75.6 Gy (24.2% versus 0%, P < .0001). The 10-year symptomatic local failure rate was only 2% for all patients.  Conclusions:   Contrary to lingering historical perceptions, treatment of high-risk prostate cancer with modern, high-dose, external beam radiotherapy and ADT can produce better biochemical, clinical, and survival outcomes over those from previous eras.

In order to define randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that can address this issue, this study examined factors associated with the risk of death following PSA failure.  Methods:   Of 206 men randomized to RT with or without 6 months of androgen suppression therapy (AST), 108 sustained PSA failure and began AST when PSA approached 10 ng/mL and formed the study cohort. Cox regression multivariable analysis was used to determine factors associated with death following PSA failure.  Results:   After a median follow-up of 10.3 years of 108 men with PSA failure, 64 (59%) died, with 22 (34%) dying of prostate cancer (PC). Increasing PSA velocity at recurrence was associated with a significant increase in the risk of death (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.21; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-1.45; P = .03). Among men with no/minimal versus moderate/severe comorbidity, PC comprised 42% (20 of 48) versus 12.5% (2 of 16) of all deaths, respectively.

Methods:   We performed a population-based nested case–control retrospective analysis on the Longitudinal Health Insurance Database 2000 and Registry for Catastrophic Illness Patients of Taiwan. This study is based on a malignancy cohort of 31 611 patients without a history of stroke, and 1208 patients who subsequently developed stroke served as the stroke group. Four controls of matched age, sex, entry year and entry month for each case were selected from the malignancy cohort from the non-stroke group. We used logistic regression to estimate the odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals, and applied the multivariable model to control for age, sex, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia and cardiovascular disease.  Results:   Cancer patients who received morphine had a 12% higher risk of developing stroke than non-morphine users. However, the difference was nonsignificant. A significant difference only appears in prostate cancer patients, where morphine users have a 3.02-fold (4.24- and 2.90-fold for hemorrhagic and ischemic strokes, respectively) higher risk of suffering from stroke. The risk increased significantly as the morphine dosage increased to 170 mg/year of treatment.

The incidence and Gleason grade of foamy gland carcinoma in a large prostate needle biopsy series have not been established. Foamy gland carcinoma may be deceptively benign appearing and missed on needle biopsy. Immunohistochemical staining for basal cells and α-methylacyl-CoA racemase (AMACR) can support a diagnosis of foamy gland carcinoma, but the sensitivity of AMACR for foamy gland carcinoma has been reported to be lower than that for usual acinar carcinoma. The utility of ERG immunohistochemistry in the diagnosis of foamy gland carcinoma has not been explored. The aim of this study was to characterize the incidence and Gleason grade of foamy gland carcinoma in a large consecutive series of prostate needle biopsy cases. We also assessed ERG expression in foamy gland carcinoma, in comparison with AMACR expression, to determine whether ERG expression provides added diagnostic value beyond AMACR expression. We evaluated a consecutive series of 476 prostatic adenocarcinoma needle core biopsy cases for presence, linear extent, and Gleason grade of foamy gland carcinoma. A selected block from each case containing foamy gland carcinoma was evaluated for AMACR and ERG expression by immunohistochemistry. Of the 476 cases, 17% contained a foamy gland carcinoma component, with 2% of the cases showing pure foamy gland carcinoma. Two cases of pure foamy gland carcinoma had a total linear extent of <3 mm. The majority (80%) of cases had a Gleason score 3+3=score of 6. Sensitivity of AMACR for foamy gland carcinoma was 92%, and sensitivity of ERG was 42%. No AMACR-negative case was ERG positive. Low AMACR expression was detected in 24 of 72 cases (33%), and of these cases ERG was positive in 5 (21%). In summary, foamy gland carcinoma features are relatively common in prostate needle core biopsies, the foamy gland carcinoma is admixed with usual acinar carcinoma in the majority of cases, and is usually not of high Gleason grade, although 20% are Gleason score 7 or greater. ERG immunohistochemistry did not provide added value beyond AMACR expression in most cases, suggesting that it need not be initially utilized in addition to basal cell markers and AMACR when immunohistochemistry is needed to substantiate a diagnosis of foamy gland malignancy. This is an important consideration in this era of cost-consciousness in application of immunohistochemistry. Sensitivity of AMACR for foamy gland carcinoma was comparable to that seen in studies of usual acinar carcinoma and is an excellent marker for foamy gland carcinoma of the prostate.

However, in physiopathological situations, cell migration typically occurs within a 3-dimensional (3D) environment, and little is known about the role of Arp2/3 and associated proteins in 3D cell migration. Using time resolved live-cell imaging and HT1080, a fibrosarcoma cell line commonly used to study cell migration, we find that the Arp2/3 complex and associated proteins N-WASP, WAVE1, cortactin, and Cdc42 regulate 3D cell migration. We report that this regulation is caused by formation of multigeneration dendritic protrusions, which mediate traction forces on the surrounding matrix and effective cell migration. The primary protrusions emanating directly from the cell body and prolonging the nucleus forms independent of Arp2/3 and dependent on focal adhesion proteins FAK, talin, and p130Cas. The Arp2/3 complex, N-WASP, WAVE1, cortactin, and Cdc42 regulate the secondary protrusions branching off from the primary protrusions. In 3D matrices, fibrosarcoma cells as well as migrating breast, pancreatic, and prostate cancer cells do not display lamellipodial structures. This study characterizes the unique topology of protrusions made by cells in a 3D matrix and show that these dendritic protrusions play a critical role in 3D cell motility and matrix deformation.

We estimated the risks of primary cancers other than colorectal cancer following a diagnosis of colorectal cancer in mutation carriers.  Methods:   We obtained data from the Colon Cancer Family Registry for 764 carriers of an MMR gene mutation (316 MLH1, 357 MSH2, 49 MSH6, and 42 PMS2), who had a previous diagnosis of colorectal cancer. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate their cumulative risk of cancers 10 and 20 years after colorectal cancer. We estimated the age-, sex-, country- and calendar period-specific standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) of cancers following colorectal cancer, compared with the general population.  Results:   Following colorectal cancer, carriers of MMR gene mutations had the following 10-year risk of cancers in other organs: kidney, renal pelvis, ureter, and bladder (2%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1% to 3%); small intestine, stomach, and hepatobiliary tract (1%, 95% CI = 0.2% to 2%); prostate (3%, 95% CI = 1% to 5%); endometrium (12%, 95% CI = 8% to 17%); breast (2%, 95% CI = 1% to 4%); and ovary (1%, 95% CI = 0% to 2%). They were at elevated risk compared with the general population: cancers of the kidney, renal pelvis, and ureter (SIR = 12.54, 95% CI = 7.97 to 17.94), urinary bladder (SIR = 7.22, 95% CI = 4.08 to 10.99), small intestine (SIR = 72.68, 95% CI = 39.95 to 111.29), stomach (SIR = 5.65, 95% CI = 2.32 to 9.69), and hepatobiliary tract (SIR = 5.94, 95% CI = 1.81 to 10.94) for both sexes; cancer of the prostate (SIR = 2.05, 95% CI = 1.23 to 3.01), endometrium (SIR = 40.23, 95% CI = 27.91 to 56.06), breast (SIR = 1.76, 95% CI = 1.07 to 2.59), and ovary (SIR = 4.19, 95% CI = 1.28 to 7.97).

An analysis of a Japanese national database""","""WHAT'S KNOWN ON THE SUBJECT? AND WHAT DOES THE STUDY ADD?: Recently, the ineffectiveness of bowel mechanical preparation prior to colorectal surgery was focused on. Although its effectiveness was widely accepted in laparoscopic prostatectomy, the data were limited. This retrospective multicentre study compared laparoscopic prostatectomy cases with and without bowel preparation and did not demonstrate the preparation's preferable effect in operation time and complication incidence, which suggested justification of the omission of bowel preparation.  Objective:   To evaluate the effect of mechanical bowel preparation (MBP) prior to laparoscopic radical prostatectomy on peri-operative outcomes.  Patients and methods:   Patients undergoing laparoscopic radical prostatectomy for T1-T2 tumours between 2008 and 2010 were identified in the Japanese Diagnosis Procedure Combination database. Patients were classified into a preoperative MBP group and a non-MBP group. The effects of MBP were evaluated by multivariate regression analysis of overall complication rate, operation time, postoperative length of stay (PLOS) and total costs with generalized estimating equations adjustment involving age, body mass index, Charlson score, hospital academic status and hospital volume.  Results:   Comparing the 154 non-MBP and 580 MBP patients, overall complication rate, operation time, PLOS and total costs were 6.5% vs 6.9% (P = 0.860), 222 vs 250 min (P = 0.001), 11 vs 10 days (P < 0.001) and 18,941 vs 19,015 US dollars (P = 0.032), respectively. In the multivariate analyses, no significant differences were observed for the four outcomes (P = 0.961, 0.194, 0.383 and 0.993, respectively). Complications were more frequently observed in older patients, and operation time tended to be longer in patients with higher body mass index and in hospitals with lower volumes. Longer PLOS and higher total costs were associated with older age, higher Charlson score and lower hospital volume.  Conclusions:   We could not find any superiority of MBP on overall complications, operation time, PLOS and total costs in laparoscopic radical prostatectomy. The results support that MBP can be omitted prior to laparoscopic radical prostatectomy for T1-T2 prostate cancer.""","""['Toru Sugihara', 'Hideo Yasunaga', 'Hiromasa Horiguchi', 'Tetsuya Fujimura', 'Hiroaki Nishimatsu', 'Haruki Kume', 'Kazuhiko Ohe', 'Shinya Matsuda', 'Kiyohide Fushimi', 'Yukio Homma']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Does mechanical bowel preparation improve quality of laparoscopic nephrectomy?

These measures were completed at baseline, within 1 year, and between 1 and 3 years from baseline. Mixed model repeated measures analysis was used to examine associations between mental health at baseline and sexual and urinary outcomes in a subset of RP patients with complete follow-up.  Results:   Among 679 men who comprised the study cohort, baseline prevalence of moderate or higher levels of depression or anxiety were low (<5%), while levels of mild depression or anxiety ranged from 3-16% over time.

Such registration is challenging due to the change in volume and deformation of the prostate during excision and fixation. One approach towards this problem involves the use of an ex vivo MRI of the excised prostate specimen, followed by in vivo to ex vivo MRI registration of the prostate. We propose a novel registration method that uses a patient-specific biomechanical model acquired using magnetic resonance elastography to deform the in vivo volume and match it to the surface of the ex vivo specimen. The forces that drive the deformations are derived from a region-based energy, with the elastic potential used for regularization. The incorporation of elastography data into the registration framework allows inhomogeneous elasticity to be assigned to the in vivo volume. We show that such inhomogeneity improves the registration results by providing a physical regularization of the deformation map.

Methods:   This prospective comparative study enrolled 248 consecutive male patients 70 years of age or younger with clinically localized prostate cancer [PCa: age ≤ 70 years, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) ≤ 10 ng/ml, biopsy Gleason score ≤ 7] who were fully continent, potent, and candidates for bilateral nerve-sparing (BNS) LRP or RALP.

Results:   In the final analysis, 91 LRP and 136 RALP patients were evaluated. The median follow-up period was 21 months for the 91 LRP patients and 18 months for the 136 RALP patients (p = 0.07). Of the 227 patients, 87 reached pentafecta [25 LRP patients (27.5 %) vs 62 RALP patients (45.6 %), p = 0.006]. Of the 140 patients who failed pentafecta, 90 (64.3 %) missed a single parameter. In these cases, erectile deficit was the leading cause of pentafecta failure, with a significant [corrected] difference between groups (80 % LRP cases that missed potency recovery [corrected] vs 53.3 % RALP, p = 0.007). Lower age, lower pathologic stage, and RALP are significantly associated with pentafecta as independent factors. For the pT3 disease, the two techniques did not differ significantly.  Conclusions:   Patients submitted to BNS RP have low possibilities of achieving pentafecta. Use of the robotic platform by a single surgeon significantly enhances the possibility of achieving pentafecta independently of age and pathologic stage. Potency was the most difficult outcome to reach after surgery, and it was the main factor leading to pentafecta failure.

The polymorphisms in the VDR gene have been hypothesized to alter the risk of prostate cancer. However, studies investigating the association between VDR polymorphisms (BsmI and FokI) and prostate cancer (PCa) risk report conflicting results , therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis to re-examine the controversy. Published literatures from PubMed, Embase, Google Scholar, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) were searched (updated to March 9, 2013). According to our inclusion criteria, studies that observed the association between VDR BsmI and FokI polymorphisms and PCa risk were included. The principal outcome measure was the odds ratio (OR) with 95 % confidence interval (CI) for PCa risk associated with VDR BsmI and FokI polymorphisms. Thirty-four studies involving 10,267 cases and 11,489 controls were recruited. Overall, we did not find evidence to support an association between any of the VDR polymorphisms and PCa risk. For BsmI, the pooled OR was 0.894 (95 % CI 0.773 to 1.034) for the Bb vs. bb genotypes, 1.002 (95 % CI 0.869 to 1.157) for the BB vs. bb genotypes, 0.922 (95 % CI 0.798 to 1.065) for the dominant model (BB/Bb vs. bb), and 1.018 (95 % CI 0.936 to 1.107) for the recessive model (BB vs. Bb/bb). ORs for the FokI polymorphisms were similar. The results suggest that the VDR BsmI and FokI polymorphisms are not related to PCa risk.

We examined and compared the methods of three companies (23andMe, deCODEme, and Navigenics) that have offered direct-to-consumer personal genome testing.  Methods:   We simulated genotype data for 100,000 individuals on the basis of published genotype frequencies and predicted disease risks using the methods of the companies. Predictive ability for six diseases was assessed by the AUC.  Results:   AUC values differed among the diseases and among the companies. The highest values of the AUC were observed for age-related macular degeneration, celiac disease, and Crohn disease. The largest difference among the companies was found for celiac disease: the AUC was 0.73 for 23andMe and 0.82 for deCODEme. Predicted risks differed substantially among the companies as a result of differences in the sets of single nucleotide polymorphisms selected and the average population risks selected by the companies, and in the formulas used for the calculation of risks.

Protein microarrays have enabled the identification of proteins, some of which associated with apoptosis, that may play a role in the development of such a tumor. Inhibition of apoptosis is a co-factor that contributes to the onset and progression of prostate cancer, though the molecular mechanisms are not entirely understood. Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP-1) gene is required for translocation of the apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) from the mitochondria to the nucleus. Hence, it is involved in programmed cell death. Different PARP-1 gene expression has been observed in various tumors such as glioblastoma, lung, ovarian, endometrial, and skin cancers. We evaluated the expression of PARP-1 protein in prostatic cancer and normal prostate tissues by immunohistochemistry in 40 men with prostate cancer and in 37 normal men. Positive nuclear PARP-1 staining was found in all samples (normal prostate and prostate cancer tissues). No cytoplasmic staining was observed in any sample. PARP-1-positive cells resulted significantly higher in patients with prostate carcinoma compared with controls (P&lt;0.001). PARP-1 over-expression in prostate cancer tissue compared with normal prostate suggests a greater activity of PARP-1 in these tumors.

Two of the most prominent techniques for rare cancer cell separation, immunocapture and dielectrophoresis (DEP), are currently limited by a performance tradeoff between high efficiency and high purity. The development of a platform capable of these two performance criteria can potentially be facilitated by incorporating both DEP and immunocapture. We present a hybrid DEP-immunocapture system to characterize how DEP controls the shear-dependent capture of a prostate cancer cell line, LNCaP, and the nonspecific adhesion of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Characterization of cell adhesion with and without DEP effects was performed in a Hele-Shaw flow cell that was functionalized with the prostate-specific monoclonal antibody, J591. In this model system designed to make nonspecific PBMC adhesion readily apparent, we demonstrate LNCaP enrichment from PBMCs by precisely tuning the applied AC electric field frequency to enhance immunocapture of LNCaPs and reduce nonspecific adhesion of PBMCs with positive and negative DEP, respectively. Our work shows that DEP and immunocapture techniques can work synergistically to improve cancer cell capture performance, and it informs the design of future hybrid DEP-immunocapture systems with improved CTC capture performance to facilitate research on cancer metastasis and drug therapies.""","""['Chao Huang', 'He Liu', 'Neil H Bander', 'Brian J Kirby']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Biomed Microdevices""","""['Characterization of a hybrid dielectrophoresis and immunocapture microfluidic system for cancer cell capture.', 'Characterization of microfluidic shear-dependent epithelial cell adhesion molecule immunocapture and enrichment of pancreatic cancer cells from blood cells with dielectrophoresis.', 'On the design of deterministic dielectrophoresis for continuous separation of circulating tumor cells from peripheral blood cells.', 'Microfluidic devices for the isolation of circulating rare cells: a focus on affinity-based, dielectrophoresis, and hydrophoresis.', 'Highlighting the uniqueness in dielectrophoretic enrichment of circulating tumor cells.', 'On-chip modeling of tumor evolution: Advances, challenges and opportunities.', 'Protein Dielectrophoresis with Gradient Array of Conductive Electrodes Sheds New Light on Empirical Theory.', 'Real-Time Detection of Tumor Cells during Capture on a Filter Element Significantly Enhancing Detection Rate.', 'Development and Clinical Prospects of Techniques to Separate Circulating Tumor Cells from Peripheral Blood.', 'Dielectric Characterization and Separation Optimization of Infiltrating Ductal Adenocarcinoma via Insulator-Dielectrophoresis.']"""

The FPANs do not initially fluoresce in the spectral region associated with the fluorophore, due to the quenching effect of the Au nanoparticles. When PSA was added to a solution containing the FPANs, PSA recognized and cleaved the specific sequence of the peptides attached to the Au nanoparticles. As a result, FITCs were separated from the Au nanoparticles and emitted strong fluorescence in their spectral region. Using this detection method, PSA was successfully detected as a function of concentration (10 pM-100 nM).

Linear mixed regression models were used to account for variations in time-on-treatment and baseline body mass index (BMI).  Results:   Fifty-five patients received a median of 7.5 months abiraterone followed by 5.4 months abiraterone and dexamethasone. Muscle loss was observed on single-agent abiraterone (maximal in patients with baseline BMI >30, -4.3%), but no further loss was observed after addition of dexamethasone. Loss of visceral fat was also observed on single-agent abiraterone, (baseline BMI >30 patients -19.6%). In contrast, addition of dexamethasone led to an increase in central visceral and total fat and BMI in all the patients.

A report from the SEARCH database group""","""Objective:   To examine the ability of various postoperative nomograms to predict prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM) and to validate that they could predict aggressive biochemical recurrence (BCR). Prostate-specific antigen (PSA), grade, and stage are the classic triad used to predict BCR after radical prostatectomy (RP). Multiple nomograms use these to predict risk of BCR. A previous study showed that several nomograms could predict aggressive BCR (prostate-specific antigen doubling time [PSADT] <9 months) more accurately than BCR. However, it remains unknown if they can predict more definitive endpoints, such as PCSM.  Methods:   We performed Cox analyses to examine the ability of 4 postoperative nomograms, the Duke Prostate Center (DPC) nomogram, the Kattan postoperative nomogram, the Johns Hopkins Hospital (JHH) nomogram, and the joint Center for Prostate Disease Research(CPDR)/Cancer of the Prostate Strategic Urologic Research Endeavor (CaPSURE) nomogram to predict BCR and PCSM among 1778 men in the Shared Equal Access Regional Cancer Hospital (SEARCH) database who underwent RP between 1990 and 2009. We also compared their ability to predict BCR and aggressive BCR in a subset of men. We calculated the c-index for each nomogram to determine its predictive accuracy for estimating actual outcomes.  Results:   We found that each nomogram could predict aggressive BCR and PCSM in a statistically significant manner and that they all predicted PCSM more accurately than they predicted BCR (ie, with higher c-index values).  Conclusion:   Currently available nomograms used to predict BCR accurately predict PCSM and other more clinically relevant endpoints. Moreover, not only do they significantly predict PCSM, but do so with generally greater accuracy than BCR.""","""['Anna E Teeter', 'Joseph C Presti Jr', 'William J Aronson', 'Martha K Terris', 'Christopher J Kane', 'Christopher L Amling', 'Stephen J Freedland']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Urology""","""['Editorial comment.', 'Nomogram Predicting Prostate Cancer-specific Mortality for Men with Biochemical Recurrence After Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Are biochemical recurrence outcomes similar after radical prostatectomy and radiation therapy?

Methods:   The black rice pericarp extract was used to treat the PC-3 cells. The inhibitory effect of black rice pericarp extract on cells proliferation of PC-3 was tested by MTT method. Cell apoptosis rates and cell cycle were measured by flow cytometric assay (FCM). Western blot was used to study the protein expression levels of p38, p-p38, JNK, p-JNK.  Results:   A dose-dependent and time-dependent proliferation inhibition of black rice pericarp extract was demonstrated in PC-3. The most prominent experiment condition was inhibitory concentration with 300microg/ml and treated for 72 h. The experiment result of flow cytometry analysis demonstrates that the apoptosis rate of PC-3 cells increased along with the increasing of black rice pericarp extract concentration, and a G1-S cell cycle arrest was induced in a dose-dependent manner. After PC-3 cell was treated with black rice pericarp extract for 72 h, the expressions of p-p38, p-JNK protein increased.  Conclusion:   Black rice pericarp extract could inhibit proliferation, change the cell cycle distributions and induce apoptosis in human prostatic cancer cell PC-3.

Data from large cohort studies usually exhibit subsets of regressors that are missing for some study subjects. Furthermore, such studies often give rise to censored data. In this article, a carefully formulated likelihood-based technique for the regression analysis of right-censored competing risks data when two of the covariates are discrete and partially missing is developed. The approach envisaged here comprises two models: one describes the covariate effects on both long-term incidence and conditional latencies for each cause of death, whilst the other deals with the observation process by which the covariates are missing. The former is formulated with a well-established mixture model and the latter is characterised by copula-based bivariate probability functions for both the missing covariates and the missing data mechanism. The resulting formulation lends itself to the empirical assessment of non-ignorability by performing sensitivity analyses using models with and without a non-ignorable component.

The purpose of this study is to determine whether this stromal signature, termed the ""DTF fibroblast"" (desmoid-type fibromatosis) signature, is specific to breast cancer or is a common stromal response found in different types of cancer.  Experimental designs:   The DTF fibroblast signature was applied to gene expression profiles from five ovarian, five lung, two colon, and three prostate cancer expression microarray datasets. In addition, two different tissue microarrays of 204 ovarian tumors and 140 colon tumors were examined for the expression of previously characterized protein markers of DTF fibroblast signature. The DTF fibroblast stromal response was then correlated with clinicopathologic features.  Results:   The DTF fibroblast signature is robustly present in ovarian, lung, and colon carcinomas. Both expression microarray data and immunohistochemistry show that the subset of ovarian tumors with strong DTF fibroblast signature expression has statistically significant, worse survival outcomes. No reproducible survival differences were found in either the lung or the colon cancers. The prostate cancers failed to show a DTF fibroblast signature. Multivariant analysis showed that DTF fibroblast signature was significantly more prognostic than the proliferation status in ovarian carcinomas.  Conclusions:   Our results suggest that the DTF fibroblast signature is a common tumor stroma signature in different types of cancer, including ovarian, lung, and colon carcinomas. Our findings provide further insight into the DTF fibroblast stromal responses across different types of carcinomas and their potential as prognostic and therapeutic targets.""","""['Julia L-Y Chen', 'Iñigo Espinosa', 'Albert Y Lin', 'Olivia Y-W Liao', 'Matt van de Rijn', 'Robert B West']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Clin Cancer Res""","""['Stromal responses among carcinomas--letter.', 'Stromal responses among carcinomas--response.', 'The fibromatosis signature defines a robust stromal response in breast carcinoma.', 'Next generation sequencing-based expression profiling identifies signatures from benign stromal proliferations that define stromal components of breast cancer.', 'Analysis of stromal signatures in the tumor microenvironment of ductal carcinoma in situ.', 'Stem cell origin of death-from-cancer phenotypes of human prostate and breast cancers.', 'Stromal cell regulation of inflammatory responses.', 'A mathematical-descriptor of tumor-mesoscopic-structure from computed-tomography images annotates prognostic- and molecular-phenotypes of epithelial ovarian cancer.', 'Targeting the tumour stroma to improve cancer therapy.', 'Repurposed drug screen identifies cardiac glycosides as inhibitors of TGF-β-induced cancer-associated fibroblast differentiation.', 'Genetic instability in the tumor microenvironment: a new look at an old neighbor.', 'Clinically Relevant Molecular Subtypes in Leiomyosarcoma.']"""

Additionally, the carcinogenic effects of their co-exposure are not known. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of chronic exposure to arsenic, estrogen, and their combination, on cell growth and transformation, and identify the mechanism behind these effects.  Methods:   RWPE-1 human prostate epithelial cells were chronically exposed to arsenic and estrogen alone and in combination. Cell growth was measured by cell count and cell cycle, whereas cell transformation was evaluated by colony formation assay. Gene expression was measured by quantitative real-time PCR and confirmed at protein level by Western blot analysis. MLH1 promoter methylation was determined by pyrosequencing method.  Results:   Exposure to arsenic, estrogen, and their combinations increases cell growth and transformation in RWPE-1 cells. Increased expression of Cyclin D1 and Bcl2, whereas decreased expression of mismatch repair genes MSH4, MSH6, and MLH1 was also observed. Hypermethylation of MLH1 promoter further suggested the epigenetic inactivation of MLH1 expression in arsenic and estrogen treated cells. Arsenic and estrogen combination caused greater changes than their individual treatments.  Conclusions:   Findings of this study for the first time suggest that arsenic and estrogen exposures cause increased cell growth and survival potentially through epigenetic inactivation of MLH1 resulting in decreased MLH1-mediated apoptotic response, and consequently increased cellular transformation.""","""['Justin Treas', 'Tulika Tyagi', 'Kamaleshwar P Singh']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Chronic coexposure to arsenic and estrogen potentiates genotoxic estrogen metabolic pathway and hypermethylation of DNA glycosylase MBD4 in human prostate epithelial cells.', 'Molecular events associated with arsenic-induced malignant transformation of human prostatic epithelial cells: aberrant genomic DNA methylation and K-ras oncogene activation.', 'Effects of chronic exposure to arsenic and estrogen on epigenetic regulatory genes expression and epigenetic code in human prostate epithelial cells.', 'Environmental arsenic exposure and DNA methylation of the tumor suppressor gene p16 and the DNA repair gene MLH1: effect of arsenic metabolism and genotype.', 'Promoter hypermethylation of DNA repair genes MLH1 and MSH2 in adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas of the lung.', 'Estrogen Receptor-β Gene Cytosine-Adenine (ESR2-CA) Repeat Polymorphism in Postmenopausal Colon Cancer.', 'Nanoplastics and Arsenic Co-Exposures Exacerbate Oncogenic Biomarkers under an In Vitro Long-Term Exposure Scenario.', 'Crosstalk between Environmental Inflammatory Stimuli and Non-Coding RNA in Cancer Occurrence and Development.', 'Cell cycle pathway dysregulation in human keratinocytes during chronic exposure to low arsenite.', 'A Tox21 Approach to Altered Epigenetic Landscapes: Assessing Epigenetic Toxicity Pathways Leading to Altered Gene Expression and Oncogenic Transformation In Vitro.']"""

Our results indicate that BK enhances the migration of prostate cancer cells by increasing ICAM-1 expression through a signal transduction pathway that involves the B2 receptor, PI3K, Akt, and AP-1.

Aim:   To quantify MMP-11 expression in prostatic adenocarcinoma tissues and to determine whether its overexpression correlates with survival outcome, and to assess its potential as a new prognostic marker.  Materials and methods:   Expression of MMP-11 was analyzed using immunohistochemistry in 103 Thai patients with prostatic adenocarcinoma. Overall survival was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier methods and Cox regression models.  Results:   Immunoreactivity of MMP-11 was seen in the stroma of prostatic adenocarcinoma tissue samples, high expression being significantly correlated with poor differentiation in Gleason grading, pathologic tumor stage 4 (pT4), and positive-bone metastasis (p<0.05), but not age and prostatic-specific antigen (PSA) level.

Patient demographic data, levels of PSA at diagnosis, Gleason score for the biopsy core, T-staging as well as the lymph node status were recorded and analysed.  Results:   258 men were included. The mean age of those 90 men (34.9%) with bone metastasis was 69.2 ± 7.3 years. Logistic regression found that PSA level (P=0.000) at diagnosis and patient's nodal-stage (P=0.02) were the only two independent variables able to predict the probability of bone metastasis among the newly diagnosed prostate cancer patients. Among those with a low PSA level less than 20 ng/ml, and less than 10 ng/ml, bone metastasis were detected in 10.3% (12 out of 117) and 9.7% (7 out of 72), respectively. However, by combining PSA level of 10 ng/ml or lower, and nodal negative as the two criteria to predict negative bone scan, a relatively high negative predictive value of 93.8% was obtained. The probability of bone metastasis in prostate cancer can be calculated with this formula: -1.069+0.007(PSA value, ng/ml) +1.021(Nodal status, 0 or 1)=x Probability of bone metastasis=2.718 x/1+2.718 x.

Methods:   Protein expression of REPS2 in ESCCs and adjacent non-cancerous tissues from 120 patients was analyzed by immunohistochemistry and correlated with clinicopathological parameters and patient outcome. Additionally, thirty paired ESCC tissues and four ESCC cell lines and one normal human esophageal epithelial cell line were evaluated for REPS2 mRNA and protein expression levels by quantitative RT-PCR and Western blotting.  Results:   REPS2 mRNA and protein expression levels were down-regulated in ESCC tissues and cell lines.

Results:   A total of 1,521 males more than 50 years of age were assessed and screened after meeting the inclusion criteria. The vast majority of individuals, 1,452 (96.2%), had PSA ≤4.0 ng/ml. Abnormal PSA (>4 ng/ml) was found in 58 (3.8%). Abnormal DRE was found in 26 (1.72%). DRE and PSA were both abnormal in 26 (1.72%) individuals. On the basis of raised PSA or abnormal DRE 58 (3.84%) individuals were subjected to digitally guided trucut biopsy. Biopsy report revealed benign prostatic hyperplasia in 47 (3.11%) and adenocarcinoma prostate in 11 (0.73%). The specificity of DRE was 66.0%with a sensitivity of 90.9% and a positive predictive value of 38.5%. The sensitivity of PSA more than 4ng/ml in detecting carcinoma prostate was 100% and the positive predictive value for serum PSA was 19.0%  Conclusions:   The overall cancer detection rate in this study was 0.73% and those detected were locally advanced. Larger community-based studies are highly warranted specially among high-risk groups.""","""['Narayan Prasad Belbase', 'Chandra Shekhar Agrawal', 'Paras Kumar Pokharel', 'Sudha Agrawal', 'Madhab Lamsal', 'Vikal Chandra Shakya']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Asian Pac J Cancer Prev""","""['An evaluation of usefulness of prostate specific antigen and digital rectal examination in the diagnosis of prostate cancer in an unscreened population:experience in a Nigerian teaching hospital.', 'Digital rectal examination in primary care is important for early detection of prostate cancer: a retrospective cohort analysis study.', 'Prostate cancer screening in a Saudi population: an explanatory trial study.', 'Status of PSA determination for early detection of prostate carcinoma.', 'Early management of prostate cancer: how to respond to an elevated PSA?', 'The Clinical Efficacy of Prostate Cancer Screening in Worldwide and Iran: Narrative Review.', 'Prostate cancer screening in Europe and Asia.', 'A hospital based study on reference range of serum prostate specific antigen levels.']"""

Methods:   This was a prospective single-center, case-control study. A total of 40 consecutive patients with organ-confined prostate cancer were submitted to radical prostatectomy with the preservation of the muscular internal sphincter and the proximal urethra (group 1), and their outcomes were compared with those of 40 patients submitted to a standard procedure (group 2). Continence rates were assessed using a self-administrated questionnaire at 3, 7 and 30 days, and 3 and 12 months after removal of the catheter.  Results:   Group 1 had a faster recovery of early continence than group 2 at day 3 (45% vs 22%; P = 0.029) and at day 7 (75% vs 50%; P = 0.018). Considering the number of pads, group 1 had a faster recovery of continence at 3, 7 and 30 days, and also had less incidence of severe incontinence. There was no statistically significant difference in terms of continence at 3 and 12 months among the two groups. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that surgical technique and young age were significantly associated with earlier time to continence at 3 and 7 days. The two groups had no significant differences in terms of surgical margins.  Conclusions:   Our modified technique of radical retropubic prostatectomy with preservation of the smooth muscular internal sphincter, as well as of the proximal urethra during bladder neck dissection, results in a significantly increased urinary continence at 3, 7 and 30 days after catheter removal, with a minor incidence of severe incontinence. The technique is also oncologically safe, and it does not increase the operative duration of the procedure.""","""['Eugenio Brunocilla', 'Riccardo Schiavina', 'Cristian Vincenzo Pultrone', 'Marco Borghesi', 'Martina Rossi', 'Matteo Cevenini', 'Giuseppe Martorana']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Int J Urol""","""['Editorial comment to Preservation of the smooth muscular internal (vesical) sphincter and of the proximal urethra for the early recovery of urinary continence after retropubic radical prostatectomy: a prospective case-control study.', 'Preservation of the internal vesical sphincter and proximal urethra during retropubic radical prostatectomy may improve earlier recovery of continence in selected patients.', 'Preservation of the smooth muscular internal (vesical) sphincter and of the proximal urethra during retropubic radical prostatectomy: a technical modification to improve the early recovery of continence.', 'The early recovery of continence after retropubic radical prostatectomy is possible: preservation of the smooth muscular internal (vescical) sphincter and of the proximal urethra.', 'Simplified vesico-urethral anastomosis after radical retropubic prostatectomy for cancer.
