Molecular pathway-level mechanisms are intrinsically more stable and more robust than an individual gene. The Functional Analysis of Individual Microarray Expression (FAIME) we developed allows distinctive sample-level pathway measurements with utility for correlation with continuous phenotypes (e.g. survival). Further, we and others have previously demonstrated that pathway-level classifiers can be as accurate as gene-level classifiers using curated genesets that may implicitly comprise ascertainment biases (e.g. KEGG, GO). Here, we hypothesized that transformation of individual prostate cancer patient gene expression to pathway-level mechanisms derived from automated high throughput analyses of genomic datasets may also permit personalized pathway analysis and improve prognosis of recurrent disease.  Results:   Via FAIME, three independent prostate gene expression arrays with both normal and tumor samples were transformed into two distinct types of molecular pathway mechanisms: (i) the curated Gene Ontology (GO) and (ii) dynamic expression activity networks of cancer (Cancer Modules). FAIME-derived mechanisms for tumorigenesis were then identified and compared. Curated GO and computationally generated ""Cancer Module"" mechanisms overlap significantly and are enriched for known oncogenic deregulations and highlight potential areas of investigation. We further show in two independent datasets that these pathway-level tumorigenesis mechanisms can identify men who are more likely to develop recurrent prostate cancer (log-rank_p = 0.019).  Conclusion:   Curation-free biomodules classification derived from congruent gene expression activation breaks from the paradigm of recapitulating the known curated pathway mechanism universe.""","""['James L Chen', 'Alexander Hsu', 'Xinan Yang', 'Jianrong Li', 'Younghee Lee', 'Gurunadh Parinandi', 'Haiquan Li', 'Yves A Lussier']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""BMC Med Genomics""","""['Single sample expression-anchored mechanisms predict survival in head and neck cancer.', 'miRNA-mRNA correlation-network modules in human prostate cancer and the differences between primary and metastatic tumor subtypes.', 'Development and Validation of an Individualized Immune Prognostic Signature for Recurrent Prostate Cancer.', 'A TMEFF2-regulated cell cycle derived gene signature is prognostic of recurrence risk in prostate cancer.', 'Integrated Analysis Revealed Prognostic Factors for Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'Genome-wide whole blood transcriptome profiling in a large European cohort of systemic sclerosis patients.', ""Developing a 'personalome' for precision medicine: emerging methods that compute interpretable effect sizes from single-subject transcriptomes."", 'A genome-by-environment interaction classifier for precision medicine: personal transcriptome response to rhinovirus identifies children prone to asthma exacerbations.', 'Analysis of aggregated cell-cell statistical distances within pathways unveils therapeutic-resistance mechanisms in circulating tumor cells.', 'COPD Hospitalization Risk Increased with Distinct Patterns of Multiple Systems Comorbidities Unveiled by Network Modeling.']"""

Multiparametric prostate magnetic resonance imaging (MP-MRI) may help better select AS candidates.  Methods:   We reviewed a cohort of men who underwent MP-MRI with MRI/Ultrasound fusion-guided prostate biopsy and selected potential AS patients at entry using Johns Hopkins criteria. MP-MRI findings were assessed, including number of lesions, dominant lesion diameter, total lesion volume, prostate volume, and lesion density (calculated as total lesion volume/prostate volume). Lesions were assigned a suspicion score for cancer by MRI. AS criteria were reapplied based on the confirmatory biopsy, and accuracy of MP-MRI in predicting AS candidacy was assessed. Logistic regression modeling and chi-square statistics were used to assess associations between MP-MRI interpretation and biopsy results.  Results:   Eighty-five patients qualified for AS with a mean age of 60.2 years and mean prostate-specific antigen level of 4.8 ng/mL. Of these, 25 patients (29%) were reclassified as not meeting AS criteria based on confirmatory biopsy. Number of lesions, lesion density, and highest MRI lesion suspicion were significantly associated with confirmatory biopsy AS reclassification. These MRI-based factors were combined to create a nomogram that generates a probability for confirmed AS candidacy.  Conclusion:   As clinicians counsel patients with PCa, MP-MRI may contribute to the decision-making process when considering AS. Three MRI-based factors (number of lesions, lesion suspicion, and lesion density) were associated with confirmatory biopsy outcome and reclassification. A nomogram using these factors has promising predictive accuracy for which future validation is necessary. Cancer 2013;119:3359-66. Published 2013.

Methods:   A total of 575 patients who underwent primary RP for localized prostate cancer and subsequently received SRT at a tertiary medical institution were reviewed retrospectively. Primary outcomes of interest were biochemical failure (BF), distant metastasis (DM), and prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM), which were assessed via univariate analysis and Fine and Grays competing risks multivariate models.  Results:   On pathologic evaluation, 563 (98%) patients had a documented Gleason score (GS). The median follow-up post-SRT was 56.7 months. A total of 60 (10.7%) patients had primary, secondary, or tertiary GP5. On univariate analysis, the presence of GP5 was prognostic for BF (hazard ratio [HR] 3.3; P < .0001), DM (HR:11.1, P < .0001), and PCSM (HR:8.8, P < .0001). Restratification of the Gleason score to include GP5 as a distinct entity resulted in improved prognostic capability. Patients with GP5 had clinically worse outcomes than patients with GS8(4+4). On multivariate analysis, the presence of GP5 was the most adverse pathologic predictor of BF (HR 2.9; P < .0001), DM (HR 14.8; P < .0001), and PCSM (HR 5.7; P < .0001).

This phase 2 study evaluated the efficacy of intravenous (IV) panobinostat in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) who had previously received chemotherapy. The primary end point was 24-week progression-free survival. Secondary end points included safety, tolerability, and the proportion of patients with a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) decline.  Methods:   IV panobinostat (20 mg/m(2)) was administered to patients on days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle.

Materials and methods:   From November 2004 to December 2007, patients referred to our clinic with a PSA ! 4 ng/ml or an abnormal digital rectal examination (DRE) were scheduled for trans-rectal ultrasound (TRUS) guided 12-core prostate biopsy.

Results:   A total of 650 patients underwent 12 cores transrectal ultrasound prostatic biopsy in the study period.

Widespread HGPIN on a second biopsy was significantly associated with PCa on further biopsy (!2 = 4.04, p = 0.04). Moreover, the presence of widespread HGPIN significantly predicted the risk of PCa on crude and adjusted logistic regressions.

While parity reduced ovarian cancer risk, no differences were found for other risk factors by parity. Among ever users of hormone therapy, body mass index suggestively increased the risk of ovarian cancer by 1.5-fold in nulliparous but not parous women (P-heterogeneity=0.08).

However, the relationship between MetS and prostate cancer remains to be definitively assessed. We evaluated the association between obesity and MetS with prostate cancer pathology and surgical and functional outcomes.  Materials and methods:   A total of 2,639 patients underwent robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP) for localized prostate cancer between March 2003 and July 2012. Of them, 186 patients met the criteria for MetS as defined by the presence of obesity (body mass index [BMI] ≥ 30 kg/m(2)) in conjunction with 2 or more of the following: hypertension (HTN), dyslipidemia (D), and diabetes (DM). Additionally, reference cohorts of (1) 663 nonobese men without HTN, D, or DM; (2) 184 obese patients without HTN, D, or DM; and (3) 211 obese men with solitary risk factors were identified for comparison. Demographic, histopathologic, and perioperative clinical parameters were compared.  Results:   In comparison with patients without MetS, patients with MetS had larger prostates (Odds Ratio (OR) = 1.609, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) = 1.04-2.49, P = 0.03), increased blood loss (OR = 1.592, 95% CI = 1.15-2.21, P = 0.01), and surgical complexity (OR = 4.940, 95% CI = 2.29-10.69, P<0.001). There was no statistical difference observed between these groups in regard to complication rates, pathologic grade, stage, and postoperative continence or erectile function. With the exception of larger prostates found among men with MetS, men with obesity alone and obesity with 1 additional risk factor appeared similar to those with MetS.  Conclusions:   Patients with MetS had similar perioperative, histopathologic, and functional outcomes compared with reference cohorts undergoing RALP.

Historical findings from this area are often used as the basis for calculating the risk of lymph node metastasis in patients with prostate cancer. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to determine whether this sampling is a realistic representation of actual risk of lymphatic spread. This is important for risk assessment as well as for targeting lymphatics in treatment.  Materials and methods:   We attempted to reconcile historical anatomic descriptions with contemporary imaging and surgical experience to try to obtain an accurate description of the lymphatic drainage of the prostate.  Results and conclusions:   Although obturator lymph nodes are clearly one of the possible sites of spread of prostate cancer, their sampling was never intended to be a definitive description of the routes of lymphatic cancer or the absolute incidence of lymph node metastasis. There are multiple other lymphatic areas at risk, with drainage primarily from the periprostatic area to the deep branches of the internal iliac lymphatics. The subsequent spread is to the perirectal and lower sacral vessel lymphatics, the proximal external iliac, the obturator, the upper sacral, common iliacs, and, ultimately, the para-aortic lymphatics. Describing the risk of lymphatic spread of prostate cancer based on obturator lymph node dissection alone is not totally accurate and probably underestimates the actual risk by 50% or more. A better understanding of the routes of drainage should make therapy that targets the lymphatics more effective.""","""['Gregory P Swanson', 'John K Hubbard']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Clin Genitourin Cancer""","""['Visualisation of the lymph node pathway in real time by laparoscopic radioisotope- and fluorescence-guided sentinel lymph node dissection in prostate cancer staging.', 'Lymphatic spread of nodal metastases in high-risk prostate cancer: The ascending pathway from the pelvis to the retroperitoneum.', 'Pelvic lymph node dissection for prostate cancer: frequency and distribution of nodal metastases in a contemporary radical prostatectomy series.', 'Lymphatic drainage and CTV in carcinoma of the prostate.', 'Unusual localizations of sentinel lymph nodes in early stage cervical cancer: a review.', 'In vivo prostate cancer research: Key interspecies prostate anatomical features for translation medicine.', 'Mesorectal Lymph Node Metastases as Index Lesion in 68Ga-PSMA-PET/CT Imaging for Recurrent Prostate Cancer.', 'What are the odds?

Materials and methods:   REDEEM was a 3-year, randomized, double-blind study of patients in 65 North American academic centers. Eligible men were 48 to 82 years old, with low risk prostate cancer (T1c-T2a), Gleason score 6 or less, 3 or fewer cores positive, tumor less than 50% of any 1 core, serum prostate specific antigen 11 ng/ml or less, life expectancy greater than 5 years and undergoing active surveillance. Entry biopsies (10 cores or more) were required. The analysis included 276 patients with 1 biopsy or more after the start of study treatment. Patients received dutasteride 0.5 mg per day or placebo for 3 years. Time to pathological progression (volume [4 or more cores positive or 50% or greater of 1 core] or grade progression [Gleason score 7 or greater]) in a post-baseline biopsy (not preceded by therapeutic intervention), and baseline variables were analyzed using a Cox proportional hazard model.  Results:   In total 94 of 276 patients with a post-baseline biopsy (34.1%) had pathological progression, 54 (19.6%) had volume progression only, 19 (6.9%) had grade progression only and 21 (7.6%) had both types of progression. Older age (HR 1.05, 95% CI 1.01-1.08, p=0.009) and higher prostate specific antigen density (HR 1.06, 95% CI 1.04-1.09, p<0.001) were associated with pathological progression. Post-baseline prostate specific antigen identified grade, but not volume progression in patients treated with placebo and dutasteride.

We defined the impact of pseudocapsular invasion on the risk of post-prostatectomy biochemical recurrence.  Materials and methods:   Patients with pT2-3a prostate cancer were identified from a prospectively recorded database. Those with pT2 disease were categorized according to pseudocapsular invasion presence or absence. The impact of pseudocapsular invasion on biochemical recurrence was determined by univariable and multivariable Cox regression analysis.  Results:   In a cohort of 1,338 patients we identified 595 with organ confined cancer positive for pseudocapsular invasion. Compared to tumors without evidence of invasion, pseudocapsular invasion was positively associated with higher Gleason grade and tumor volume (1.2 vs 1.9 cc, each p<0.001). On univariable analysis there was no difference in biochemical recurrence-free survival between patients with vs without pseudocapsular invasion, although those with extraprostatic extension had significantly lower biochemical recurrence-free survival (p<0.001). This was confirmed on multivariable analysis, which revealed that extraprostatic extension was a significant independent predictor of biochemical recurrence (HR 1.53, p=0.018). The presence of pseudocapsular invasion had no effect (HR 0.81, p=0.33).  Conclusions:   Pseudocapsular invasion is not a pathological feature associated with an adverse outcome after prostatectomy. Thus, the depth of tumor invasion is not a continuum of risk and access to periprostatic adipose tissue is a more important determinant of disease behavior than an invasive phenotype.""","""['Jada Kapoor', 'Benjamin Namdarian', 'John Pedersen', 'Chris Hovens', 'Daniel Moon', 'Justin Peters', 'Anthony J Costello', 'Paul Ruljancich', 'Niall M Corcoran']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Reply by authors.', 'Editorial comment.', 'Lymphovascular invasion is an independent prognostic factor in prostatic adenocarcinoma.', 'Radial distance of extraprostatic extension measured by ocular micrometer is an independent predictor of prostate-specific antigen recurrence: A new proposal for the substaging of pT3a prostate cancer.', 'The significance of positive surgical margin in areas of capsular incision in otherwise organ confined disease at radical prostatectomy.', 'Perineural invasion as a predictor of extraprostatic extension of prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Periprostatic adipose tissue and prostate cancer progression: new insights into the tumor microenvironment.', 'Obesity and prostate cancer - microenvironmental roles of adipose tissue.', 'Mechanisms of Prostate Cancer Cells Survival and Their Therapeutic Targeting.', 'Lymphatic Dissemination in Prostate Cancer: Features of the Transcriptomic Profile and Prognostic Models.', 'Emerging Hallmarks of Metabolic Reprogramming in Prostate Cancer.', ""Role of Lipids and Lipid Metabolism in Prostate Cancer Progression and the Tumor's Immune Environment.""]"""

Methods:   Patients (n=396) completed the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ) Bone Metastases module (BM22) at baseline. The EORTC QLQ-BM22 consists of four scales: painful site (PS), pain characteristics (PC), functional interference (FI), and psychosocial aspect (PA) scales. EORTC QLQ-BM22 data, together with sociodemographic and medical factors were analyzed by univariate analysis of variance (ANOVA). Items of significance were determined through backward selection, which were then put through multivariate analysis to determine further significance.  Results:   Through ANOVA analysis, KPS>80 and breast primary histology were predictive of better HRQOL in the PS scale, while KPS>80, female gender, and breast primary histology were predictive of better HRQOL in the PC and FI scales. KPS>80 and prostate primary histology were predictive of better HRQOL in the PA scale. KPS>80 and primary cancer site were confirmed as significant predictive factors in multivariate analysis.  Recommendations:   This study identified baseline factors of gender, performance status, and primary histology as determinants of HRQOL in patients with bone metastases.

Patients and methods:   A nested pilot study of 26 consecutive men with a visible discrete focus on mpMRI, correlating with positive histology on transperineal template mapping biopsy, who underwent focal HIFU (Sonablate 500®) within a prospective, Ethics Committee-approved multicentre trial ('INDEX'). Non-rigid image registration software developed in our institution was used to transfer data on the location and limits of the index lesion as defined by mpMRI. Manual contouring of the prostate capsule and histologically confirmed MR-visible lesion was performed preoperatively by a urologist and uro-radiologist. A deformable patient-specific computer model, which captures the location of the target lesion, was automatically generated for each patient and registered to a 3D transrectal ultrasonography (US) volume using a small number (10-20) of manually defined capsule points. During the focal HIFU, the urologist could add additional sonications after image-registration if it was felt that the original treatment plan did not cover the lesion sufficiently with a margin.  Results:   Prostate capsule and lesion contouring was achieved in <5 min preoperatively. The mean (range) time taken to register images was 6 (3-16) min.

Materials and methods:   Between 2001 and 2010, 89 patients for untreated high-risk clinically localized prostate cancer on the risk classification as defined by D'Amico, underwent retropubic radical prostatectomy and extended pelvic lymphadenectomy. Boundaries of the pelvic lymph node dissection field divided into external iliac vessels, obturator fossa, and internal iliac vessels. We investigated mainly the postoperative outcome of 84 patients without any adjuvant therapies. PSA recurrence-free survival among the pretreatment variables was estimated using Kaplan-Meier plots, and the statistical significance was determined by log rank test.  Results:   In 89 high-risk patients, 32.7% had pT3-pT4 tumors, 16.9% positive surgical margin, 6.7% positive lymph node metastases and 30.3% Gleason score 8-10 at the pathological examination. A median of 13 nodes (mean 14.0, range 9-25 nodes) were removed per patient. In 96.6% cases, postoperative PSA values decreased less than 0.2 ng/ml. The median observation period after operation was 1,819 days. Median PSA recurrence-free survival rates, overall survival and cancer cause-specific survival rates at 5 year, in 84 high-risk patients without any adjuvant therapies, were 73.8%, 100% and 100%, respectively. Median PSA recurrence-free survival rates according to pathological T stage and surgical margin status were statistically significant, but that according to preoperative 3 factors (clinical T stage, Gleason score at biopsy, preoperative PSA values) were statistically insignificant. Moreover, that according to both the number of positive preoperative 3 factors (1 vs. 2 positive factors) and the number of removed lymph nodes (< or =13 vs. > or = 14), were statistically insignificant.

Associations between prostate adenocarcinoma-specific endpoints and CRP in patients who are treated for localized disease remain unknown.  Methods:   In total, 206 patients who received radiation therapy for adenocarcinoma of the prostate had at least 1 CRP measured in follow-up and were analyzed. The primary outcome was biochemical failure-free survival. In addition, associations were examined between CRP and prostate-specific antigen (PSA).  Results:   On univariate analysis, higher CRP levels were associated significantly with shorter biochemical failure-free survival for patients who received radiation therapy after undergoing radical prostatectomy. For patients who were managed with definitive radiation therapy alone, higher CRP levels also were associated significantly with shorter biochemical failure-free survival on univariate and multivariable analyses (hazard ratio, 2.03; 95% confidence interval, 1.19-3.47; P = .009). In addition, CRP levels were associated significantly with PSA after radical prostatectomy for patients who had Gleason scores ≥ 8 (P = .037), for high-risk patients (P = .008), and for those with pretreatment PSA levels > 20 ng/mL (P = .05).

Furthermore, alterations in energy metabolism are a hallmark of prostate cancer cells. However, the actions of inflammatory factors on the energy metabolism of prostate epithelial cells have not been previously investigated. This is the first study to report on the effect of the inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) on the glycolytic and oxidative metabolism, and the mitochondrial function of widely used prostate epithelial cells.  Methods:   Pre-malignant RWPE-1 and cancerous LNCaP and PC-3 cells were treated with low-dose TNFα. Glycolytic and oxidative metabolism was quantified by measuring extracellular acidification and oxygen consumption rates, respectively. ATP content and lactate export were measured by luminescence and fluorescence, respectively. Mitochondrial content and the expression of glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor co-activator 1 alpha (PGC-1α), and Cytochrome C were measured by flow cytometry.  Results:   Our data suggest that TNFα increases glycolysis, ATP production, and lactate export, while it reduces oxidative metabolism and mitochondrial function in prostate epithelial cells. The highly aggressive PC-3 cells tend to be less responsive to the actions of TNFα than the pre-malignant RWPE-1 and the non-aggressive LNCaP cells.  Conclusions:   Cellular energetics, that is, glycolytic and oxidative metabolism is significantly influenced by low-level inflammation in prostate epithelial cells. In widely used prostate epithelial cell models, the micro-environmental inflammatory cytokine TNFα induces aerobic glycolysis while inhibiting oxidative metabolism. This supports the hypothesis that low-level inflammation can induce Warburg metabolism in prostate epithelial cells, which may promote cancer formation and progression.""","""['Roger A Vaughan', 'Randi Garcia-Smith', 'Kristina A Trujillo', 'Marco Bisoffi']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Tumor necrosis factor alpha induces Warburg-like metabolism and is reversed by anti-inflammatory curcumin in breast epithelial cells.', 'Tumor microenvironment and metabolic synergy in breast cancers: critical importance of mitochondrial fuels and function.', 'Androgen-responsive and nonresponsive prostate cancer cells present a distinct glycolytic metabolism profile.', 'Leucine treatment enhances oxidative capacity through complete carbohydrate oxidation and increased mitochondrial density in skeletal muscle cells.', 'Revisiting the Warburg effect: historical dogma versus current understanding.', 'Effect of LDHA Inhibition on TNF-α-Induced Cell Migration in Esophageal Cancers.', 'Metabolic Modifications by Common Respiratory Viruses and Their Potential as New Antiviral Targets.', 'Inflammatory metabolic profile of South African patients with prostate cancer.', 'Quercetin Antagonizes Glucose Fluctuation Induced Renal Injury by Inhibiting Aerobic Glycolysis via HIF-1α/miR-210/ISCU/FeS Pathway.', 'MYD88 signals induce tumour-initiating cell generation through the NF-κB-HIF-1α activation cascade.']"""

The protective roles of the whey-acid-motif-4-disulphide core (WFDC) proteins, secretory leukoproteinase inhibitor (SLPI) and WFDC2, in the prostate were also examined.  Methods:   UTI recurrence was assessed retrospectively in men following initial UTI by patient interview. PSA, SLPI, and WFDC2 gene expression were assessed using biopsy samples. LNCaP and DU145 in vitro prostate cell models were utilized to assess the effects of an Escherichia coli challenge on PSA and WFDC gene expression, and bacterial invasion of the prostate epithelium. The effects of PSA on WFDC antimicrobial properties were studied using recombinant peptides and time-kill assays.  Results:   Men presenting with PSA >4 ng/ml at initial UTI were less likely to have recurrent (r) UTI than those with PSA <4 ng/ml [2/15 (13%) vs. 7/10 (70%), P < 0.01]. Genes encoding PSA, SLPI and WFDC2, were expressed in prostatic epithelium, and the PSA and SLPI proteins co-localized in vivo. Challenging LNCaP (PSA-positive) cells with E. coli increased PSA, SLPI, and WFDC2 gene expression (P < 0.05), and PSA synthesis (P < 0.05), and reduced bacterial invasion. Pre-incubation of DU145 (PSA-negative) cells with PSA also decreased bacterial invasion. In vitro incubation of recombinant SLPI and WFDC2 with PSA resulted in peptide proteolysis and increased E. coli killing.

The aim of this study is to assess the oncologic outcomes of patients who underwent RARP at least 5 years ago, with an emphasis on biochemical recurrence-free survival (BCRFS).  Materials and methods:   In 2004, RARP was introduced at our institutions. Records of all patients having RARP were prospectively collected in a dedicated database as part of the NUVOLA-BAUS project. For the present study, we selected only patients who had a follow-up of at least 5 years. Endpoints were BCRFS rate and 5-year cancer-specific survival (CSS).  Results:   Overall, we identified 175 patients; 61.7 % of patients had Gleason 7-9 disease and 26.9 % had pT ≥ 3 disease at final pathology. Eight patients (4.5 %) had biochemical recurrence at follow-up. Overall 5-year BCRFS rate was 95.4 %, while it was 97.6, 91 and 50 % in pT2, pT3 and pT4 diseases, respectively. Among the patients who recurred, the mean time to recurrence was 22.1 ± 8.8 months. These patients received salvage external beam radiation treatment combined with hormonal therapy (anti-androgen + LHRH analogue) or hormonal therapy alone. 5-year CSS was 98.3 % (172/175): in 2 cases, the specimen showed pT4 cancer, while lymph node metastasis was noted in one case.

Thus, we quantified PML using preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and evaluated its impact on base surgical margin (BSM) status during RALP.  Methods:   The clinical data of consecutive patients who underwent RALP were retrieved from a prospectively registered database. Of the 655 eligible men, 9 patients were excluded because they did not undergo MRI. PML was measured in a T2-weighted mid-sagittal scan. We performed univariate and multiple logistic regression analyses.  Results:   The mean PML was 8.3 ± 3.6 mm. The rate of positive surgical margins was 17.3 % (73/423) in pathologic stage T2 and 34.6 % (226/646) in all cases. The BSMs were positive in 10.1 % (66/646) of cases. A logistic regression analysis revealed that PML was significantly correlated with BSM positivity in all cases (odds ratio [OR] 1.080, p = 0.026). In particular, they had a stronger correlation with pathologic stage T3 or higher (OR 1.1143, p = 0.004). PML was an independent predictor of BSM positivity (OR 1.113, p = 0.046) in pathologic stage T3 or higher, as were preoperative prostate-specific antigen, prostate size, and pathologic stage.

Results:   A total of 9 guidelines (ovarian, colorectal, pancreatic, gastric, breast, prostate, oral cancer, melanoma and Hodgkin lymphoma) were included in our analysis. The total number of statements is highly diverse, ranging from 35 to 150. Only few statements and recommendations are given regarding supportive, psychosocial or complementary therapy. Regarding conventional treatments, only two guidelines (ovarian and oral cancer) have more than 50 % statements and recommendations on level 1. Considering supportive treatments, the LoE is lower, except the guideline on pancreatic cancer (40 % level 1). In breast cancer, all statements are based on expert consensus. Four guidelines do not include any statement at all. All guidelines beside that on Hodgkin lymphoma include at least one statement or recommendation on psychosocial therapy. Most recommendations are GCP.CAM is discussed in 8 guidelines; LoE is low with GCP statements dominating.  Discussion:   There may be different reasons for the low number of statements and recommendations on supportive, psychosocial and CAM therapies. Often, these topics are considered less important, and evidence is assumed as being low. In the GGPO, guidelines focusing on psychosocial and supportive therapy are under development. Thus, cancer-specific guidelines will be able to refer to these guidelines and only include recommendations on psychosocial care and supportive therapy which are specific for the type of cancer. A national guideline on CAM would close the gap of information for physicians and patients. In case of missing or low evidence, a transparent description of this uncertainty would be valuable information to professionals and patients.""","""['J Huebner', 'M Follmann']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Cancer Res Clin Oncol""","""['Recommendations on complementary and alternative medicine within S3 guidelines in oncology: systematic quality assessment of underlying methodology.', 'The future of Cochrane Neonatal.', 'An interpretive review of consensus statements on clinical guideline development and their application in the field of traditional and complementary medicine.', 'Moving from evidence to developing recommendations in guidelines: article 11 in Integrating and coordinating efforts in COPD guideline development.

All patients were randomly allocated into two groups: SOA alone (group A) or SOA combined with tegafur-uracil (group B). The mRNA expression of four enzymes, including thymidylate synthase (TS), dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD), orotate phospho-ribosyltransferase (OPRT) and thymidine phosphorylase (TP), in prostate cancer cells was analyzed by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Fifty-two patients were enrolled in this study. The median age was 77 (range: 47-92) years. The PSA response rate in group B (61.5%) tended to be higher compared to that in group A (34.6%) (p=0.095). Group B (median: 15.9 months) had a significantly longer time to PSA progression (TTP) compared to group A (6.4 months) (p=0.014). In patients with a lower TS expression or a higher OPRT expression, group B demonstrated a higher PSA response rate compared to group A (p=0.019 and p=0.041, respectively). In addition, in the patients with a lower TS expression, group B demonstrated a significantly longer TTP compared to group A (p=0.018). There were no severe adverse events in either treatment group.

Methods:   The study population comprised 32 patients with prostate cancer who underwent a single-injection dual-imaging protocol with PET/CT and subsequent PET/MR. PET/CT scans were performed applying standard clinical protocols (5 min after injection of 793 ± 69 MBq [(11)C]choline, 3 min per bed position, intravenous contrast agent). Subsequently (52 ± 15 min after injection) PET/MR was performed (4 min per bed position). PET images were reconstructed iteratively (OSEM 3D), scatter and attenuation correction of emission data and regional allocation of [(11)C]choline foci were performed using CT data for PET/CT and segmented Dixon MR, T1 and T2 sequences for PET/MR. Image quality of the respective PET scans and PET alignment with the respective morphological imaging modality were compared using a four point scale (0-3). Furthermore, number, location and conspicuity of the detected lesions were evaluated. SUVs for suspicious lesions, lung, liver, spleen, vertebral bone and muscle were compared.  Results:   Overall 80 lesions were scored visually in 29 of the 32 patients. There was no significant difference between the two PET scans concerning number or conspicuity of the detected lesions (p not significant). PET/MR with T1 and T2 sequences performed better than PET/CT in anatomical allocation of lesions (2.87 ± 0.3 vs. 2.72 ± 0.5; p = 0.005). The quality of PET/CT images (2.97 ± 0.2) was better than that of the respective PET scan of the PET/MR (2.69 ± 0.5; p = 0.007). Overall the maximum and mean lesional SUVs exhibited high correlations between PET/CT and PET/MR (ρ = 0.87 and ρ = 0.86, respectively; both p < 0.001).  Conclusion:   Despite a substantially later imaging time-point, the performance of simultaneous PET/MR was comparable to that of PET/CT in detecting lesions with increased [(11)C]choline uptake in patients with prostate cancer. Anatomical allocation of lesions was better with simultaneous PET/MR than with PET/CT, especially in the bone and pelvis.

The nomogram, however, has not been validated in an independent dataset, especially in a series out of clinical trials. Thus, the objective of the current study was to validate the TAX 327 nomogram in a community setting in China. A total of 146 patients with mCRPC who received first-line chemotherapy (docetaxel or mitoxantrone) were identified. Because clinical trials are limited in mainland China, those patients did not receive investigational treatment after the failure of first-line chemotherapy. The predicted overall survival rate was calculated from the TAX 327 nomogram. The validity of the model was assessed with discrimination, calibration and decision curve analysis. The median survival of the cohort was 21 months (docetaxel) and 19 months (mitoxantrone) at last follow-up. The predictive c-index of the TAX 327 nomogram was 0.66 (95% CI: 0.54-0.70). The calibration plot demonstrated that the 2-year survival rate was underestimated by the nomogram. Decision curve analysis showed a net benefit of the nomogram at a threshold probability greater than 30%.

Robust ERG-mediated transcriptional changes, observed only in the setting of Pten loss, included the restoration of AR transcriptional output and upregulation of genes involved in cell death, migration, inflammation and angiogenesis. Similarly, ETS variant 1 (ETV1) positively regulated the AR cistrome and transcriptional output in ETV1-translocated, PTEN-deficient human prostate cancer cells. In two large clinical cohorts, expression of ERG and ETV1 correlated with higher AR transcriptional output in PTEN-deficient prostate cancer specimens.

The unusual organization of INK4A-ARF has long led to speculation of a need for coordinated regulation of p14(ARF) and p16. We now show that p14(ARF) (ARF) regulates the stability of p16 protein in human cancer cell lines, as well as in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). In particular, ARF promotes rapid degradation of p16 protein, which is mediated by the proteasome and, more specifically, by interaction of ARF with one of its subunits, REGγ. Furthermore, this ARF-dependent destabilization of p16 can be abrogated by knockdown of REGγ or by pharmacologic blockade of its nuclear export. Thus, our findings have uncovered a novel crosstalk of 2 key tumor suppressors mediated by a REGγ-dependent mechanism. The ability of ARF to control p16 stability may influence cell-cycle function.

In this article, we investigate the relationship between baseline serum androgen (SA) levels and OS.  Patients and methods:   COU-AA-301 is a randomized, double-blind study of AA (1,000 mg every day) plus P (5 mg by mouth twice daily; n = 797) versus P alone (n = 398). Randomization was stratified by Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (0 to 1 v 2), pain (Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form over past 24 hours: 4 to 10, present; v 0 to 3, absent), prior chemotherapy (1 v 2), and progression (prostate-specific antigen v radiographic). Association of baseline SA (testosterone, androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate), was measured by ultrasensitive liquid-liquid extraction or protein precipitation and two-dimensional liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry, with OS determined by bivariate and multivariable Cox models. OS was examined with SA as greater than median and less than or equal to the median.  Results:   Median survival increased with each quartile increase in testosterone level regardless of treatment arm. SA levels at baseline strongly associated with survival (P < .0001) in bivariate and multivariable analyses.

We demonstrate the clinical utility of the NanoVelcro Chip by performing serial enumerations of CTCs in prostate cancer patients after undergoing systemic therapy. Changes in CTC numbers after 4-10 weeks of therapy were compared with their clinical responses. We observed a statistically significant reduction in CTCs counts in the clinical responders. We performed long-term follow up with serial CTC collection and enumeration in one patient observing variations in counts correlating with treatment response.

Patients and methods:   Baseline mGPS and NLR were calculated in a prospective cohort of chemotherapy-naive patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) (AT-101-CS-205 trial) who received docetaxel and prednisone ± AT101. Cox proportional hazards regression models estimated their effects on overall survival (OS).  Results:   Of 220 eligible patients, mGPS and neutrophil and lymphocyte counts were available for 184, 193, and 112 patients, respectively.

Conclusion:   Our results demonstrate the prognostic role of the mGPS in mCRPC over variables previously identified. mGPS is inexpensive, easily measured, and could be incorporated into routine clinical testing if our results are confirmed in a subsequent validation study.

However, very little is known about its expression and regulation in human tissues. The purpose of this study was to characterize the expression pattern of PDF in cancerous tissues and to identify mechanisms that regulate its expression.  Methods:   The mRNA expression levels of PDF and methionine aminopeptidase 1D (MAP1D), an enzyme involved in a related pathway with PDF, were determined using tissue panels containing cDNA from patients with various types of cancer (breast, colon, kidney, liver, lung, ovarian, prostate, or thyroid) and human cell lines. Protein levels of PDF were also determined in 2 colon cancer patients via western blotting. Colon cancer cells were treated with inhibitors of ERK, Akt, and mTOR signaling pathways and the resulting effects on PDF and MAP1D mRNA levels were determined by qPCR for colon and lung cancer cell lines. Finally, the effects of a PDF inhibitor, actinonin, on the proliferation of breast, colon, and prostate cell lines were determined using the CyQUANT assay.  Results:   PDF and MAP1D mRNA levels were elevated in cancer cell lines compared to non-cancer lines. PDF mRNA levels were significantly increased in breast, colon, and lung cancer samples while MAP1D mRNA levels were increased in just colon cancers. The expression of PDF and MAP1D varied with stage in these cancers. Further, PDF protein expression was elevated in colon cancer tissue samples. Inhibition of the MEK/ERK, but not PI3K or mTOR, pathway reduced the expression of PDF and MAP1D in both colon and lung cancer cell lines. Further, inhibition of PDF with actinonin resulted in greater reduction of breast, colon, and prostate cancer cell proliferation than non-cancer cell lines.  Conclusions:   This is the first report showing that PDF is over-expressed in breast, colon, and lung cancers, and the first evidence that the MEK/ERK pathway plays a role in regulating the expression of PDF and MAP1D. The over-expression of PDF in several cancers and the inhibition of cancer cell growth by a PDF inhibitor suggest this enzyme may act as an oncogene to promote cancer cell proliferation.""","""['Harsharan Randhawa', 'Shireen Chikara', 'Drew Gehring', 'Tuba Yildirim', 'Jyotsana Menon', 'Katie M Reindl']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['MAP1D, a novel methionine aminopeptidase family member is overexpressed in colon cancer.', 'Specific overexpression of OLFM4(GW112/HGC-1) mRNA in colon, breast and lung cancer tissues detected using quantitative analysis.', 'Opposite regulation by PI3K/Akt and MAPK/ERK pathways of tissue factor expression, cell-associated procoagulant activity and invasiveness in MDA-MB-231 cells.', 'An unusual peptide deformylase features in the human mitochondrial N-terminal methionine excision pathway.', 'SRPKs: a promising therapeutic target in cancer.', 'Impact of Protein Nα-Modifications on Cellular Functions and Human Health.', 'Therapeutic potential of human serum albumin nanoparticles encapsulated actinonin in murine model of lung adenocarcinoma.', 'Kinetic control of nascent protein biogenesis by peptide deformylase.', 'Targeting Mitochondrial Protein Expression as a Future Approach for Cancer Therapy.', 'RPSAP52 lncRNA Inhibits p21Waf1/CIP Expression by Interacting With the RNA Binding Protein HuR.']"""

While the incidence of CRC in the United States is among the highest in the world (approximately 52/100,000), its incidence in countries in India is among the lowest (approximately 7/100,000), suggesting that lifestyle factors may play a role in development of the disease. Whereas obesity, excessive alcohol consumption, a high-calorie diet, and a lack of physical activity promote this cancer, evidence indicates that foods containing folates, selenium, Vitamin D, dietary fiber, garlic, milk, calcium, spices, vegetables, and fruits are protective against CRC in humans. Numerous agents from ""mother nature"" (also called ""nutraceuticals,"") that have potential to both prevent and treat CRC have been identified. The most significant discoveries relate to compounds such as cardamonin, celastrol, curcumin, deguelin, diosgenin, thymoquinone, tocotrienol, ursolic acid, and zerumbone. Unlike pharmaceutical drugs, these agents modulate multiple targets, including transcription factors, growth factors, tumor cell survival factors, inflammatory pathways, and invasion and angiogenesis linked closely to CRC. We describe the potential of these dietary agents to suppress the growth of human CRC cells in culture and to inhibit tumor growth in animal models. We also describe clinical trials in which these agents have been tested for efficacy in humans.

While mechanisms enabling recurrent activity of androgen receptor (AR) are certainly involved in the development of CRPC, there may be factors that contribute to the process including acquired neuroendocrine (NE) cell-like behaviors working through alternate (non-AR) cell signaling systems or AR-dependent mechanisms. In this study, we explore the potential relationship between the AR axis and a novel putative marker of NE differentiation, the human male protocadherin-PC (PCDH-PC), in vitro and in human situations. We found evidence for an NE transdifferentiation process and PCDH-PC expression as an early-onset adaptive mechanism following ADT and elucidate AR as a key regulator of PCDH-PC expression. PCDH-PC overexpression, in turn, attenuates the ligand-dependent activity of the AR, enabling certain prostate tumor clones to assume a more NE phenotype and promoting their survival under diverse stress conditions. Acquisition of an NE phenotype by PCa cells positively correlated with resistance to cytotoxic agents including docetaxel, a taxane chemotherapy approved for the treatment of patients with metastatic CRPC.

The most common upstream fusion partner described is the androgen-regulated prostate-specific gene TMPRSS2, most frequently with ERG, but additional 5' fusion partners have been described. We performed 5' rapid amplification of cDNA ends in 18 PCas with ETV1, ETV4, or ETV5 outlier expression to identify the 5' fusion partners. We also evaluated the exon-level expression profile of these ETS genes in 14 cases. We identified and confirmed by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction the two novel chimeric genes OR51E2-ETV1 and UBTF-ETV4 in two PCas. OR51E2 encodes a G-protein-coupled receptor that is overexpressed in PCas, whereas UBTF is a ubiquitously expressed gene encoding an HMG-box DNA-binding protein involved in ribosome biogenesis. We additionally describe two novel gene fusion combinations of previously described genes, namely, SLC45A3-ETV4 and HERVK17-ETV4. Finally, we found one PCa with TMPRSS2-ETV1, one with C15orf21-ETV1, one with EST14-ETV1, and two with 14q133-q21.1-ETV1. In nine PCas (eight ETV1 and one ETV5), exhibiting ETS outlier expression and genomic rearrangement detected by FISH, no 5' fusion partner was found. Our findings contribute significantly to characterize the heterogeneous group of ETS gene fusions and indicate that all genes described as 5' fusion partners with one ETS gene can most likely be rearranged with any of the other ETS genes involved in prostate carcinogenesis.""","""['João D Barros-Silva', 'Paula Paulo', 'Anne Cathrine Bakken', 'Nuno Cerveira', 'Marthe Løvf', 'Rui Henrique', 'Carmen Jerónimo', 'Ragnhild A Lothe', 'Rolf Inge Skotheim', 'Manuel R Teixeira']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Neoplasia""","""['A fluorescence in situ hybridization screen for E26 transformation-specific aberrations: identification of DDX5-ETV4 fusion protein in prostate cancer.', 'Novel RNA hybridization method for the in situ detection of ETV1, ETV4, and ETV5 gene fusions in prostate cancer.', 'Specific and redundant activities of ETV1 and ETV4 in prostate cancer aggressiveness revealed by co-overexpression cellular contexts.', 'ETV1, 4 and 5: an oncogenic subfamily of ETS transcription factors.', 'ETS fusion genes in prostate cancer.', 'UBTF tandem duplications define a distinct subtype of adult de novo acute myeloid leukemia.', 'Analysis of rare driving events in pediatric acute myeloid leukemia.', 'Concurrent CDX2 cis-deregulation and UBTF::ATXN7L3 fusion define a novel high-risk subtype of B-cell ALL.', 'Overview of research on fusion genes in prostate cancer.', 'E26 transformation-specific variant 4 as a tumor promotor in human cancers through specific molecular mechanisms.']"""

The discovery of small molecule inhibitors that selectively target PI3K or PI3K and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) provides an opportunity to pharmacologically determine the contribution of these key signaling nodes in VEGF-A-driven tumor angiogenesis in vivo. This study used an array of micro-vascular imaging techniques to monitor the antivascular effects of selective class I PI3K, mTOR, or dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors in colorectal and prostate cancer xenograft models. Micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) angiography, dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI), vessel size index (VSI) MRI, and DCE ultrasound (DCE-U/S) were employed to quantitatively evaluate the vascular (structural and physiological) response to these inhibitors. GDC-0980, a dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor, was found to reduce micro-CT angiography vascular density, while VSI MRI demonstrated a significant reduction in vessel density and an increase in mean vessel size, consistent with a loss of small functional vessels and a substantial antivascular response. DCE-MRI showed that GDC-0980 produces a strong functional response by decreasing the vascular permeability/perfusion-related parameter, K (trans). Interestingly, comparable antivascular effects were observed for both GDC-980 and GNE-490 (a selective class I PI3K inhibitor). In addition, mTOR-selective inhibitors did not affect vascular density, suggesting that PI3K inhibition is sufficient to generate structural changes, characteristic of a robust antivascular response.

Thus, in the present study, the molecular mechanism of autophagic cell death by Tan IIA was investigated in KBM-5 leukemia cells. Tan IIA significantly increased the expression of microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3) II as a hallmark of autophagy in western blotting and immunofluorescence staining. Tan IIA augmented the phosphorylation of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and attenuated the phosphorylation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and p70 S6K in a dose-dependent manner. Conversely, autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine partly reversed the cytotoxicity and the phosphorylation of AMPK, mTOR and p70 S6K induced by Tan IIA in KBM-5 leukemia cells. In addition, Tan IIA dramatically activated the extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathway including Raf, ERK and p90 RSK in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner. Consistently, ERK inhibitor PD184352 suppressed LC3-II activation induced by Tan IIA, whereas PD184352 and PD98059 did not affect poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage and sub-G1 accumulation induced by Tan IIA in KBM-5 leukemia cells. Furthermore, Tan IIA could induce autophagy via LC3-II activation in various cancer cells such as prostate (PC-3), multiple myeloma (U266), lung (NCI-H460), and breast (MDA-MB-231) cells. Overall, these findings suggest that Tan IIA induces autophagic cell death via activation of AMPK and ERK and inhibition of mTOR and p70 S6K in KBM-5 cells as a potent natural compound for leukemia treatment.""","""['Sun-Mi Yun', 'Ji Hoon Jung', 'Soo-Jin Jeong', 'Eun Jung Sohn', 'Bonglee Kim', 'Sung-Hoon Kim']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Phytother Res""","""['Mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitors restore anoikis sensitivity in human breast cancer cell lines with a constitutively activated extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway.', 'Tanshinone IIA inhibits gastric carcinoma AGS cells through increasing p-p38, p-JNK and p53 but reducing p-ERK, CDC2 and cyclin B1 expression.', 'Lycorine Induces Apoptosis of A549 Cells via AMPK-Mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR)-S6K Signaling Pathway.', 'p70 S6 kinase as a therapeutic target in cancers: More than just an mTOR effector.', 'TOR action in mammalian cells and in Caenorhabditis elegans.', 'New Visions on Natural Products and Cancer Therapy: Autophagy and Related Regulatory Pathways.', 'Targeting mTOR as a Cancer Therapy: Recent Advances in Natural Bioactive Compounds and Immunotherapy.', 'Adenosine monophosphate activated protein kinase contributes to skeletal muscle health through the control of mitochondrial function.', 'Salvia miltiorrhiza in cancer: Potential role in regulating MicroRNAs and epigenetic enzymes.', 'Molecular Mechanism of Tanshinone against Prostate Cancer.']"""

These drugs may possess off-target effects on the androgen receptor (AR) due to their structural similarity to DHT.  Methods:   A total of four human prostate cancer cell models were examined: LNCaP (T877A mutant AR), 22Rv1 (H874Y mutant AR), LAPC4 (wild-type AR), and VCaP (wild-type AR). Cells were cultured in 10% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum, either with or without DHT added to the medium. AR activity was evaluated using the ARE-luciferase assay or the expression of AR regulated genes.  Results:   Dutasteride was more potent than finasteride in interfering with DHT-stimulated AR signaling. Disruption of AR function was accompanied by decreased cell growth. Cells that rely on DHT for protection against death were particularly vulnerable to dutasteride. Different prostate cancer cell models exhibited different sensitivities to dutasteride and finasteride. LNCaP was most sensitive, LAPC4 and VCaP were intermediate, while 22Rv1 was least sensitive. Regardless of the AR genotype, if AR was transfected into drug-sensitive cells, AR was inhibited by drug treatment; and if AR was transfected into drug-resistant cells, AR was not inhibited.  Conclusions:   The direct inhibitory effect of dutasteride or finasteride on AR signaling is cell line specific.

Factors affecting intracellular androgen levels and the androgen receptor (AR) signaling axis need to be examined systematically in order to fully understand the outcome of interventions using these drugs.  Methods:   The expression of three 5α-reductase isozymes, as determined by immunohistochemistry and qRT-PCR, was studied in five human prostate cancer cell lines. Intracellular testosterone and DHT were analyzed using mass spectrometry. A luciferase reporter assay and AR-regulated genes were used to evaluate the modulation of AR activity.  Results:   Prostate cancer cells were capable of accumulating testosterone to a level 15-50 times higher than that in the medium. The profile and expression of 5α-reductase isozymes did not predict the capacity to convert testosterone to DHT. Finasteride and dutasteride were able to depress testosterone uptake in addition to lowering intracellular DHT. The inhibition of AR activity following drug treatment often exceeded the expected response due to reduced availability of DHT. The ability to maintain high intracellular testosterone might compensate for the shortage of DHT.

Finally, Pim-2 SiRNA was transfected into DU-145 cells and Pim-2 was transfected into RWPE-1 cells, and the level of Pim-2 and phosphorylated eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (p-eIF4B) were detected, as well as the apoptosis rate.  Results:   The Pim-2 mRNA and protein level were significantly higher in PCA tissues than those in BPH tissues. The Pim-2 mRNA and protein level in DU-145 and LNCaP cells were significantly higher than those in RWPE-1 and PNT1a cells. Pim-2 and eIF4B could co-express in DU-145 cells. Pim-2 level determined the phosphorylation level of eIF4B and the apoptosis rate of prostatic cells. The higher Pim-2 expressed, the more eIF4B phosphorylated, then the less cell got apoptosis, and vice versa.  Conclusion:   Pim-2 was over-expressed in PCA cell lines and tissues. It may inhibit the apoptosis of PCA cells through phosphorylating eIF4B, thus promote the tumorigenesis of PCA.""","""['Ke Ren', 'Xin Gou', 'Mingzhao Xiao', 'Ming Wang', 'Chaodong Liu', 'Zhaobing Tang', 'Weiyang He']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Pim-2 Cooperates with Downstream Factor XIAP to Inhibit Apoptosis and Intensify Malignant Grade in Prostate Cancer.', 'Pim-2 upregulation: biological implications associated with disease progression and perinueral invasion in prostate cancer.', 'Detection of pim-1 mRNA in prostate cancer diagnosis.', 'Pathophysiological roles of Pim-3 kinase in pancreatic cancer development and progression.', 'Laser microdissection in the molecular oncology of prostate cancer.', 'An XBP1s-PIM-2 positive feedback loop controls IL-15-mediated survival of natural killer cells.', 'The Role of Alternative Splicing Factors hnRNP G and Fox-2 in the Progression and Prognosis of Esophageal Cancer.', 'Prostate cancer resistance leads to a global deregulation of translation factors and unconventional translation.', 'PP2A promotes apoptosis and facilitates docetaxel sensitivity via the PP2A/p-eIF4B/XIAP signaling pathway in prostate cancer.', 'PIM kinase inhibition: co-targeted therapeutic approaches in prostate cancer.']"""

When conservative therapy has failed, surgical intervention with transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) may be performed, but carries a significant risk of incontinence, ranging from 18% to 70% in reported literature. We reviewed a cohort of men previously treated with radiation or brachytherapy, who underwent laser prostatectomy.  Methods:   From February 2004 to October 2011, 12 patients (Six = brachytherapy and Six = external beam radiation) underwent 532 nm GreenLight™ laser prostatectomy by a single surgeon (BBC) for chronic retention or debilitating obstructive symptoms. Preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative parameters were collected prospectively and reviewed retrospectively. Statistical analysis was performed with a Wilcox Rank sum test with significance defined as P < 0.05.  Results:   The median patient age was 77.4 (Interquartile range (IQR) 73.9, 79.1). Prior to surgery, five patients were catheter dependent. Intraopertively, the median operative time was 48 minutes (IQR 35, 67); median lasing time was 28 minutes (IQR 23, 44); median Joules used was 126,873 (IQR 95,030, 222,336) J. Postoperative median follow up was 22.9 (IQR 13.4, 41.7) months. Significant improvements were noted in IPSS, QoL scores, PVR, and Qmax after PVP treatment. At 12 months, the median decrease in IPSS, QoL scores, and PVR was 15 (IQR 14.5, 22) to 10 (IQR 5.5, 13.5), 5 (IQR 3.5, 5) to 2 (IQR 1, 3.5), 200 (IQR 171, 327.5) to 5 (IQR 1.25, 8), respectively (P < 0.05 for all). Similarly, at 12 months, the median increase in Qmax (ml/second) was 4 (IQR 3, 10) to 15.9 (IQR 11, 16) (P = 0.04). There were no reportable complications at 12 months. None of the 12 patients that underwent 532 nm GreenLight™ laser prostatectomy developed stress urinary incontinence. One patient developed metastatic prostate cancer and the remaining patients had no evidence of biochemical recurrence.  Conclusion:   In this pilot study, 532 nm GreenLight™ laser prostatectomy is feasible and safe in patients who have undergone prior radiotherapy for prostate cancer. Laser prostatectomy provides a durable response while maintaining continence in this cohort suffering from severe lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) or retention. Larger, randomized trials comparing GreenLight™ laser prostatectomy to traditional TURP are necessary to confirm non-inferiority.""","""['David No', 'E Charles Osterberg', 'Brandon Otto', 'Izolda Naftali', 'Benjamin Choi']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Lasers Surg Med""","""['Holmium:YAG transurethral incision versus laser photoselective vaporization for benign prostatic hyperplasia in a small prostate.', 'Outcomes after photoselective vaporization of the prostate and transurethral resection of the prostate in patients who develop prostatic obstruction after radiation therapy.', 'Feasibility of holmium laser enucleation of the prostate (HoLEP) for recurrent/residual benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).', 'Urinary morbidity and incontinence following transurethral resection of the prostate after brachytherapy.', 'Management of localised prostate cancer: watchful waiting, surgery or radiation therapy, depending on the natural course, which is often relatively slow.', 'Bipolar button-electrode plasma vaporization of the prostate: An effective option for patients with post-brachytherapy retention.', 'Comparison of Patients Undergoing PVP Versus TURP for LUTS/BPH.', 'Optical feedback-induced light modulation for fiber-based laser ablation.']"""

PC patients were subdivided into an aggressive (Gleason Score 8 or higher, and/or T3/T4 and/or N+/M+) and non-aggressive (all others) form of PC. Furthermore, we correlated the two datasets, as genes whose varied expression is due to a chromosomal alteration, may suggest a causal implication of these genes in the disease.

Results:   We confirmed several common altered chromosomal regions as well as recently discovered loci such as deletions on chromosomes 3p14.1-3p13 and 13q13.3-13q14.11 supporting a possible role for RYBP, RGC32, and ELF1 in tumor suppression. Integrative analysis of expression and CN data combined with data retrieved from online databases propose PTP4A3 and ELF1 as possible factors for tumor progression.

Approaches for HDAC inhibitors to improve activity against solid tumors are necessary.  Methods:   Sulforhodamine B assay and flow cytometric analysis detected cell proliferation and cell-cycle progression, respectively. Protein expression was determined by Western blotting. Comet assay and DNA end-binding activity of Ku proteins detected DNA damage and DNA repair activity, respectively. siRNA technique was used for knockdown of specific cellular target.  Results:   WJ25591 displayed inhibitory activity against HDAC1 and cell proliferation in human hormone-refractory prostate cancers PC-3 and DU-145. WJ25591 caused an arrest of cell-cycle at both G1- and G2-phase and increased protein expressions of p21 and cyclin E, followed by cell apoptosis. WJ25591-induced Bcl-2 down-regulation and activation of caspase-9, -8, and -3, suggesting apoptotic execution through both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways. WJ25591 also significantly inhibited DNA repair activity but not directly induced DNA damage. Moreover, the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 dramatically sensitized WJ25591-induced cell apoptosis. The siRNA technique demonstrated that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, in particular CHOP/GADD153 up-regulation, contributed to the synergistic effect.  Conclusions:   The data suggest that WJ25591 inhibited HDAC activity, leading to cell-cycle arrest and inhibition of DNA repair. Caspase cascades are subsequently triggered to execute cell apoptosis.

RUNX1 and CBFβ are the most common targets of chromosomal rearrangements in leukemia. CBF has been implicated in other cancer types; for example RUNX1 and RUNX2 are implicated in cancers of epithelial origin, including prostate, breast, and ovarian cancers. In these tumors, CBF is involved in maintaining the malignant phenotype and, when highly over-expressed, contributes to metastatic growth in bone. Herein, lentiviral delivery of CBFβ-specific shRNAs was used to achieve a 95% reduction of CBFβ in an ovarian cancer cell line. This drastic reduction in CBFβ expression resulted in growth inhibition that was not associated with a cell cycle block or an increase in apoptosis. However, CBFβ silencing resulted in increased autophagy and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Since sphingolipid and ceramide metabolism regulates non-apoptotic cell death, autophagy, and ROS production, fumonsin B1 (FB1), an inhibitor of ceramide synthase, was used to alter ceramide production in the CBFβ-silenced cells. FB1 treatment inhibited the CBFβ-dependent increase in autophagy and provided a modest increase in cell survival. To document alterations to sphingolipids in the CBFβ-silenced cells, ceramide, and lactosylceramide levels were directly examined by mass spectrometry. Substantial increases in ceramide species and decreases in lactosylceramides were identified. Altogether, this report provides evidence that CBF transcriptional pathways control cellular survival, at least in part, through sphingolipid metabolism.""","""['Adam H Greer', 'Thomas Yong', 'Katie Fennell', 'Yara W Moustafa', 'Marcie Fowler', 'Floyd Galiano', 'Shu-Wing Ng', 'Ross S Berkowitz', 'James Cardelli', 'Shari Meyers', 'J Nathan Davis']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Cell Physiol""","""['Association of core-binding factor β with the malignant phenotype of prostate and ovarian cancer cells.', 'The core binding factor CBF negatively regulates skeletal muscle terminal differentiation.', 'Core Binding Factor-β Knockdown Alters Ovarian Gene Expression and Function in the Mouse.', 'Proleukemic RUNX1 and CBFbeta mutations in the pathogenesis of acute leukemia.', 'Core binding factor genes and human leukemia.', 'Transcriptional activation of CBFβ by CDK11p110 is necessary to promote osteosarcoma cell proliferation.', 'RUNX3 Promotes the Tumorigenic Phenotype in KGN, a Human Granulosa Cell Tumor-Derived Cell Line.', 'Small molecule inhibition of the CBFβ/RUNX interaction decreases ovarian cancer growth and migration through alterations in genes related to epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition.', 'The histone deacetylase inhibitor cambinol prevents acidic pHe-induced anterograde lysosome trafficking independently of sirtuin activity.', 'Characterization of CADD522, a small molecule that inhibits RUNX2-DNA binding and exhibits antitumor activity.']"""

NF-κB has a role in tumorigenesis and tumor growth, as well as promotion of metastases. Mechanisms responsible for abnormal NF-κB activation are not fully elucidated; however, RelA phosphorylation, particularly at serine residues S536 and S276, is critical for RelA function. Kinases that phosphorylate RelA promote oncogenic behaviors, suggesting that phosphatases targeting RelA could have tumor-inhibiting activities; however, few RelA phosphatases have been identified. Here, we identified tumor inhibitory and RelA phosphatase activities of the protein phosphatase 2C (PP2C) phosphatase family member, PPM1A. We show that PPM1A directly dephosphorylated RelA at residues S536 and S276 and selectively inhibited NF-κB transcriptional activity, resulting in decreased expression of monocyte chemotactic protein-1/chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 and interleukin-6, cytokines implicated in cancer metastasis. PPM1A depletion enhanced NF-κB-dependent cell invasion, whereas PPM1A expression inhibited invasion. Analyses of human expression data revealed that metastatic prostate cancer deposits had lower PPM1A expression compared with primary tumors without distant metastases. A hematogenous metastasis mouse model revealed that PPM1A expression inhibited bony metastases of prostate cancer cells after vascular injection. In summary, our findings suggest that PPM1A is a RelA phosphatase that regulates NF-κB activity and that PPM1A has tumor suppressor-like activity. Our analyses also suggest that PPM1A inhibits prostate cancer metastases and as neither gene deletions nor inactivating mutations of PPM1A have been described, increasing PPM1A activity in tumors represents a potential therapeutic strategy to inhibit NF-κB signaling or bony metastases in human cancer.""","""['X Lu', 'H An', 'R Jin', 'M Zou', 'Y Guo', 'P-F Su', 'D Liu', 'Y Shyr', 'W G Yarbrough']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['PPM1A and PPM1B act as IKKbeta phosphatases to terminate TNFalpha-induced IKKbeta-NF-kappaB activation.', 'The serine phosphatase SerB of Porphyromonas gingivalis suppresses IL-8 production by dephosphorylation of NF-κB RelA/p65.', 'Negative regulation of RelA phosphorylation: emerging players and their roles in cancer.', 'WIP1 phosphatase is a negative regulator of NF-kappaB signalling.', 'A comprehensive overview of PPM1A: From structure to disease.', 'Gypenosides Synergistically Reduce the Extracellular Matrix of Hepatic Stellate Cells and Ameliorate Hepatic Fibrosis in Mice.', 'Discovery of Novel Small-Molecule Scaffolds for the Inhibition and Activation of WIP1 Phosphatase from a RapidFire Mass Spectrometry High-Throughput Screen.', 'Ampelopsin Suppresses Stem Cell Properties Accompanied by Attenuation of Oxidative Phosphorylation in Chemo- and Radio-Resistant MDA-MB-231 Breast Cancer Cells.', 'Metal dependent protein phosphatase PPM family in cardiac health and diseases.', 'The protein phosphatase PPM1A dephosphorylates and activates YAP to govern mammalian intestinal and liver regeneration.']"""

Our goal was to design a small peptide that possesses similar functions to an antibody drug conjugate with regard to targeting and killing cancer cells, but that overcomes size restrictions.  Materials and methods:   We designed a novel cancer-specific killer peptide created by fusion of the toxic peptide (KLAKLAK)2 with the cancer recognition peptide LTVSPWY.  Results:   This bi-functional peptide showed toxicity to breast cancer, prostate cancer, and neuroblastoma cell lines. Only low toxicity to non-cancer cells, colon cancer, lung cancer, and lymphoma cell lines was observed. In vivo injections of the bi-functional peptide caused tumor growth retardation compared to mice treated with control peptides. The bi-functional peptide caused retardation of MDA-MB-435S tumors in vivo and increased survival to 80% at day 100 after tumor implantation, whereas all control animals died at day 70. Previous reports showed that the recognition moiety LTVSPWY targets the tumor-associated antigen HER2. Here we found that our new peptide TP-Tox also excerts toxic effects on HER2-negative cell lines. Therefore, we searched for the molecular target of the bi-specific peptide using immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry. Our data suggest a possible interaction with RAS GTPase-activating protein binding protein 1 (G3BP1).  Conclusion:   We designed a bi-functional peptide of 23 amino acids and demonstrated its ability to bind and kill several cancer cell lines in vitro and to strongly increase survival in breast cancer bearing mice in vivo.

By providing nutrition and an escape route from the primary site, angiogenesis is also required for tumor metastasis. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3Ks) are well known to play important roles in tumorigenesis as well as metastasis. ZSTK474 is a specific PI3K inhibitor developed for solid tumor therapy. In the present report, antimetastatic activities of ZSTK474 were investigated in vitro by determining the effects on the main metastatic processes. ZSTK474 exhibited inhibitory effects on migration, invasion and adhesive ability of prostate cancer PC3 cells. Furthermore, ZSTK474 inhibited phosphorylation of Akt substrate-Girdin, and the secretion of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP), both of which were reported to be closely involved in migration and invasion.

In previous research, it was found that urolithins could mainly inhibit prostate cancer and colon cancer cell growth. However, there is no report about bladder cancer therapy of urolithins. In this paper, three urolithin-type compounds (urolithin A, urolithin B, 8-OMe-urolithin A) and ellagic acid were evaluated for antiproliferative activity in vitro against human bladder cancer cell lines T24. The IC₅₀ values for T24 cell inhibition were 43.9, 35.2, 46.3 and 33.7 μM for urolithin A, urolithin B, 8-OMe-urolithin A and ellagic acid, respectively. After the administration of urolithins and ellagic acid, we found these compounds could increase mRNA and protein expression of Phospho-p38 MAPK, and decrease mRNA and protein expression of MEKK1 and Phospho-c-Jun in T24 cells. Caspase-3 was also activated and PPAR-γ protein expression increased in drug-induced apoptosis. And what's more, the antioxidant assay afforded by three urolithins and EA treatments were associated with decreases in the intracellular ROS and MDA levels, and increased SOD activity in H₂O₂-treated T24 cells. The results suggested that these compounds could inhibit cell proliferation by p38-MAPK and/or c-Jun medicated caspase-3 activation and reduce the oxidative stress status in bladder cancer.""","""['Zhenpeng Qiu', 'Benhong Zhou', 'Long Jin', 'Honglian Yu', 'Lijuan Liu', 'Youyi Liu', 'Chengchen Qin', 'Shuixiang Xie', 'Fan Zhu']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Food Chem Toxicol""","""['In vitro antiproliferative and antioxidant effects of urolithin A, the colonic metabolite of ellagic acid, on hepatocellular carcinomas HepG2 cells.', 'Urolithins impair cell proliferation, arrest the cell cycle and induce apoptosis in UMUC3 bladder cancer cells.', 'Description of urolithin production capacity from ellagic acid of two human intestinal Gordonibacter species.', 'Ellagic Acid-Derived Urolithins as Modulators of Oxidative Stress.', 'Promising remedies for cardiovascular disease: Natural polyphenol ellagic acid and its metabolite urolithins.', 'In Silico and In Vitro Study of Antioxidant Potential of Urolithins.', 'Recent Advances and Perspectives on the Health Benefits of Urolithin B, A Bioactive Natural Product Derived From Ellagitannins.', 'GDC-0941 activates integrin linked kinase (ILK) expression to cause resistance to GDC-0941 in breast cancer by the tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α signaling pathway.', 'Ellagic acid attenuates interleukin-1β-induced oxidative stress and exerts protective effects on chondrocytes through the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1)/ Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway.', 'Ellagic Acid: A Review on Its Natural Sources, Chemical Stability, and Therapeutic Potential.']"""

Methods:   Analyses included 176,520 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) associated with 23 metabolic traits. We examined the association between SNPs and prostate cancer in 871 cases and 906 controls, including 427 high-grade cases with Gleason ≥ 7. Genetic risk scores (GRS) for body mass index (BMI) and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) were also created by summing alleles associated with increasing BMI or WHR.  Results:   Prostate cancer was associated with five loci, including cyclin M2, with P values less than 1 × 10(-4). In addition, the WHR GRS was associated with high-grade prostate cancer versus controls [OR, 1.05; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.00-1.11; P = 0.048] and high-grade prostate cancer versus low-grade prostate cancer (OR, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.01-1.13; P = 0.03). None of these findings exceeds the threshold for significance after correction for multiple testing.  Conclusions:   Variants in genes known to be associated with metabolism and obesity may be associated with prostate cancer. We show evidence for pleiotropy between WHR GRS and prostate cancer grade. This finding is consistent with the function of several WHR genes and previously described relationships with cancer traits.  Impact:   Limitations in standard obesity measures suggest alternative characterizations of obesity may be needed to understand the role of metabolic dysregulation in prostate cancer. The underlying genetics of WHR or other Metabochip SNPs, while not statistically significant beyond multiple testing thresholds within our sample size, support the metabolic hypothesis of prostate carcinogenesis and warrant further investigation in independent samples.""","""['Todd L Edwards', 'Ayush Giri', 'Saundra Motley', 'Wynne Duong', 'Jay H Fowke']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev""","""['Genetic Risk Score Mendelian Randomization Shows that Obesity Measured as Body Mass Index, but not Waist:Hip Ratio, Is Causal for Endometrial Cancer.', 'Genetic predisposition to obesity and lifestyle factors--the combined analyses of twenty-six known BMI- and fourteen known waist:hip ratio (WHR)-associated variants in the Finnish Diabetes Prevention Study.', 'Pleiotropic effects of obesity-susceptibility loci on metabolic traits: a meta-analysis of up to 37,874 individuals.', 'Inflammation polymorphisms and prostate cancer risk in Jamaican men: Role of obesity/body size.', 'Comprehensive identification of pleiotropic loci for body fat distribution using the NHGRI-EBI Catalog of published genome-wide association studies.', 'Association Analysis between Body Mass Index and Genomic DNA Methylation across 15 Major Cancer Types.', 'The effects of height and BMI on prostate cancer incidence and mortality: a Mendelian randomization study in 20,848 cases and 20,214 controls from the PRACTICAL consortium.', 'Genetic Determinants of Metabolism and Benign Prostate Enlargement: Associations with Prostate Volume.']"""

Niraparib (MK4827) is an oral potent, selective PARP-1 and PARP-2 inhibitor that induces synthetic lethality in preclinical tumour models with loss of BRCA and PTEN function. We investigated the safety, tolerability, maximum tolerated dose, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles, and preliminary antitumour activity of niraparib.  Methods:   In a phase 1 dose-escalation study, we enrolled patients with advanced solid tumours at one site in the UK and two sites in the USA. Eligible patients were aged at least 18 years; had a life expectancy of at least 12 weeks; had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 2 or less; had assessable disease; were not suitable to receive any established treatments; had adequate organ function; and had discontinued any previous anticancer treatments at least 4 weeks previously. In part A, cohorts of three to six patients, enriched for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers, received niraparib daily at ten escalating doses from 30 mg to 400 mg in a 21-day cycle to establish the maximum tolerated dose. Dose expansion at the maximum tolerated dose was pursued in 15 patients to confirm tolerability. In part B, we further investigated the maximum tolerated dose in patients with sporadic platinum-resistant high-grade serous ovarian cancer and sporadic prostate cancer. We obtained blood, circulating tumour cells, and optional paired tumour biopsies for pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic assessments. Toxic effects were assessed by common toxicity criteria and tumour responses ascribed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Circulating tumour cells and archival tumour tissue in prostate patients were analysed for exploratory putative predictive biomarkers, such as loss of PTEN expression and ETS rearrangements. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00749502.  Findings:   Between Sept 15, 2008, and Jan 14, 2011, we enrolled 100 patients: 60 in part A and 40 in part B. 300 mg/day was established as the maximum tolerated dose. Dose-limiting toxic effects reported in the first cycle were grade 3 fatigue (one patient given 30 mg/day), grade 3 pneumonitis (one given 60 mg/day), and grade 4 thrombocytopenia (two given 400 mg/day). Common treatment-related toxic effects were anaemia (48 patients [48%]), nausea (42 [42%]), fatigue (42 [42%]), thrombocytopenia (35 [35%]), anorexia (26 [26%]), neutropenia (24 [24%]), constipation (23 [23%]), and vomiting (20 [20%]), and were predominantly grade 1 or 2. Pharmacokinetics were dose proportional and the mean terminal elimination half-life was 36·4 h (range 32·8-46·0). Pharmacodynamic analyses confirmed PARP inhibition exceeded 50% at doses greater than 80 mg/day and antitumour activity was documented beyond doses of 60 mg/day. Eight (40% [95% CI 19-64]) of 20 BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation carriers with ovarian cancer had RECIST partial responses, as did two (50% [7-93]) of four mutation carriers with breast cancer. Antitumour activity was also reported in sporadic high-grade serous ovarian cancer, non-small-cell lung cancer, and prostate cancer. We recorded no correlation between loss of PTEN expression or ETS rearrangements and measures of antitumour activity in patients with prostate cancer.  Interpretation:   A recommended phase 2 dose of 300 mg/day niraparib is well tolerated. Niraparib should be further assessed in inherited and sporadic cancers with homologous recombination DNA repair defects and to target PARP-mediated transcription in cancer.

In this study we evaluated the effect of metformin on survival and pathologic outcomes in established prostate cancer.  Materials and methods:   We retrospectively identified 12,052 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy between 1997 and 2010 at Mayo Clinic. Among these, 885 (7.3%) were diabetics, including 323 taking and 562 not taking metformin. Kaplan-Meier method was utilized to calculate rates of biochemical recurrence (BCR), systemic progression (SP), and all-cause mortality (ACM). Cox models were used to estimate the metformin hazard ratio (HR) adjusted for clinical and pathologic variables.  Results and conclusions:   Median follow-up was 5.1 years. In univariate analysis, metformin HR (95% confidence intervals) was not significant for BCR (1.13 [0.84, 1.52]; P = 0.40), SP (1.37 [0.69, 2.72]; P = 0.37), and ACM (1.32 [0.84, 2.05]; P = 0.23).

The indication for rigid cystoscopy in the operating room was noted independently by either observer. Findings after rigid cystoscopy were correlated with the results of flexible water and air cystoscopy using the Pearson correlation and Student t-test.  Results:   Included in the study were 57 patients with active hematuria, of whom 36 had bladder cancer, and 257 with a history of bladder tumor. The cause of bleeding was clearly identified on water cystoscopy in 22 patients (38%), including tumors in 17 and prostate bleeding in 5, and by air cystoscopy in 49 (86%), including tumors in 32 and prostate bleeding in 17. For diagnosing bladder tumors air cystoscopy had higher sensitivity than water cystoscopy (88% vs 47%, p=0.003) and similar specificity (97% vs 100%, p=0.93). In the 295 patients without hematuria there was no difference in the indication compared to that identified on rigid cystoscopy (43 vs 43, p=1.0). Water cystoscopy revealed more small papillary tumors than air cystoscopy but the number was not significantly different (76 vs 67, p=0.26). All such implants identified on water cystoscopy alone were less than 2 mm. No complication specifically related to air cystoscopy was noted.

Prostate cancer alone accounts for 29% of all cancers in men and is the sixth leading cause of death in men. It is estimated that up to 30% of patients with cancer will develop metastatic disease, the spine being one of the most frequently affected sites in patients with prostate cancer.  Purpose:   To study this condition in a preclinical setting, we have created a novel animal model of human metastatic prostate cancer to the spine and have characterized it histologically, functionally, and via bioluminescence imaging.  Study design:   Translational science investigation of animal model of human prostate cancer in the spine.  Methods:   Luciferase-positive human prostate tumor cells PC3 (PC3-Luc) were injected in the flank of athymic male rats. PC3-Luc tumor samples were then implanted into the L5 vertebral body of male athymic rats (5 weeks old). Thirty-two rats were randomized into three surgical groups: experimental, control, and sham. Tumor growth was assessed qualitatively and noninvasively via bioluminescence emission, upon luciferin injection. To determine the functional impact of tumor growth in the spine, rats were evaluated for gait abnormalities during gait locomotion using video-assisted gait analysis. Rats were euthanized 22 days after tumor implantation, and spines were subjected to histopathological analyses.  Results:   Twenty days after tumor implantation, the tumor-implanted rats showed distinct signs of gait disturbances: dragging tail, right- or left-hind limb uncoordination, and absence of toe clearance during forward limb movement. At 20 days, all rats experienced tumor growth, evidenced by bioluminescent signal. Locomotion parameters negatively affected in tumor-implanted rats included stride length, velocity, and duration. At necropsy, all spines showed evidence of tumor growth, and the histological analysis found spinal cord compression and peritumoral osteoblastic reaction characteristic of bony prostate tumors. None of the rats in the sham or control groups demonstrated any evidence of bioluminescence signal or signs of gait disturbances.  Conclusions:   In this project, we have developed a novel animal model of metastatic spine cancer using human prostate cancer cells. Tumor growth, evaluated via bioluminescence and corroborated by histopathological analyses, affected hind limb locomotion in ways that mimic motor deficits present in humans afflicted with metastatic spine disease. Our model represents a reliable method to evaluate the experimental therapeutic approaches of human tumors of the spine in animals. Gait locomotion and bioluminescence analyses can be used as surrogate noninvasive methods to evaluate tumor growth in this model.""","""['Rachel Sarabia-Estrada', 'Patricia L Zadnik', 'Camilo A Molina', 'Ismael Jimenez-Estrada', 'Mari L Groves', 'Ziya L Gokaslan', 'Ali Bydon', 'Timothy F Witham', 'Jean-Paul Wolinsky', 'Daniel M Sciubba']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Spine J""","""['Metastatic human breast cancer to the spine produces mechanical hyperalgesia and gait deficits in rodents.', 'Delayed onset of paralysis and slowed tumor growth following in situ placement of recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein 2 within spine tumors in a rat model of metastatic breast cancer.', 'Epidural compression of the spinal cord caused by vertebral osteoblastic metastasis of prostate carcinoma.

Materials and methods:   From a database of 1046 patients, 344 post-RARP patients with biopsy Gleason scores ≤ 6 prostate cancer (PCa) without neoadjuvant therapy were included. Six AS protocols were identified and evaluated for pathological and oncological end points. Four new AS criteria were proposed and evaluated. The probabilities of each end point were estimated using logistic regression modeling. Areas under the receiver operating curve were calculated for each protocol and end point.  Results:   Across all the selected protocols, biochemical recurrence occurred in 0 to 1.9% of patients; extracapsular extension (ECE) in 0 to 5.9%; lymph node involvement (LNI) in 0 to 1.3%; and upgrading to Gleason score ≥ 7 in 12.9% to 36.4%.

Published reports of anti-proliferative effects of synthetic LXR ligands on breast, prostate, ovarian, lung, skin, and colorectal cancer cells suggest that LXRs are potential targets in cancer prevention and treatment.  Methods:   To further determine the effects of LXR ligands and identify their potential mechanisms of action in breast cancer cells, we carried out microarray analysis of gene expression in four breast cancer cell lines following treatments with the synthetic LXR ligand GW3965. Differentially expressed genes were further subjected to gene ontology and pathway analyses, and their expression profiles and associations with disease parameters and outcomes were examined in clinical samples. Response of E2F target genes were validated by real-time PCR, and the posited role of E2F2 in breast cancer cell proliferation was tested by RNA interference experiments.  Results:   We observed cell line-specific transcriptional responses as well as a set of common responsive genes. In the common responsive gene set, upregulated genes tend to function in the known metabolic effects of LXR ligands and LXRs whereas the downregulated genes mostly include those which function in cell cycle regulation, DNA replication, and other cell proliferation-related processes. Transcription factor binding site analysis of the downregulated genes revealed an enrichment of E2F binding site sequence motifs. Correspondingly, E2F2 transcript levels are downregulated following LXR ligand treatment. Knockdown of E2F2 expression, similar to LXR ligand treatment, resulted in a significant disruption of estrogen receptor positive breast cancer cell proliferation. Ligand treatment also decreased E2F2 binding to cis-regulatory regions of target genes. Hierarchical clustering of breast cancer patients based on the expression profiles of the commonly downregulated LXR ligand-responsive genes showed a strong association of these genes with patient survival.  Conclusions:   Taken together, these results indicate that LXR ligands target gene networks, including those regulated by E2F family members, are critical for tumor biology and disease progression and merit further consideration as potential agents in the prevention and treatment of breast cancers.""","""['Trang Nguyen-Vu', 'Lise-Lotte Vedin', 'Ka Liu', 'Philip Jonsson', 'Jean Z Lin', 'Nicholes R Candelaria', 'Lindsay P Candelaria', 'Sridevi Addanki', 'Cecilia Williams', 'Jan-Åke Gustafsson', 'Knut R Steffensen', 'Chin-Yo Lin']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Breast Cancer Res""","""['A nuclear receptor corepressor-dependent pathway mediates suppression of cytokine-induced C-reactive protein gene expression by liver X receptor.', 'Antiproliferative effects and mechanisms of liver X receptor ligands in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells.', 'Expression of LXR-β in human gastric cancer tissue and the effect of GW3965 on the proliferation of gastric cancer cell line SGC-7901.', 'Liver X receptor as a drug target for the treatment of breast cancer.', 'The liver X receptor: control of cellular lipid homeostasis and beyond Implications for drug design.', 'Endogenous estrogen receptor modulating oxysterols and breast cancer prognosis: Results from the MARIE patient cohort.', 'Liver X Receptor Inverse Agonist GAC0001E5 Impedes Glutaminolysis and Disrupts Redox Homeostasis in Breast Cancer Cells.', 'Computing microRNA-gene interaction networks in pan-cancer using miRDriver.', 'Structural overview and perspectives of the nuclear receptors, a major family as the direct targets for small-molecule drugs.', 'Akt/mTOR and AMPK signaling pathways are responsible for liver X receptor agonist GW3965-enhanced gefitinib sensitivity in non-small cell lung cancer cell lines.']"""

Survival of a hospital cohort""","""Prostate cancer incidence has tripled in Luxembourg as in many other western countries. From 1982 to 2006, new cases increased from 80 to 309 per year, while the incidence (world stand.pop.) rose from 29.5 to 85 per 100 000 men. Since 1991 prostate cancer is the most frequent male cancer in Luxembourg, exceeding colo-rectal, lung and stomach cancer. Prostate cancer deaths have diminished from 64 in 1982 to 45 in 2006. This represents less than 10% of male cancer related deaths; it represents the third most frequent cancer death, behind lung and colo-rectal cancers. Annual mortality rate has decreased from 29 to 10 per 100 000 men during the same period, this difference between incidence and mortality is explained on the one hand by the widespread use of PSA since the 1990's and on the other hand by a better local control as well as a multidisciplinary approach of advanced disease. The increase of the incidence is particularly important in the 60 to 70 age group, while for men older than 70, the peak incidence was reached in 2002. A lowering of the age at diagnosis is confirmed by the 5-year age group analysis. The hospital cohort consists of 628 patients from the urological department of the Centre Hospitalier de Luxembourg diagnosed with prostate cancer between 1st January 1982 and 31st December 2006; follow-up ended 31st December 2011. During this period, age at diagnosis decreased from 71.5 to 68.9 years whereas the proportion of localized clinical stages increased from 44 to 70%. Median PSA dropped from 14.5 to 9 ng/ml. Furthermore the analysis of cancer specific mortality confirms the negative effects of an advanced clinical stage (10-year survival: 90% for localized disease, 60% for advanced disease) or a high PSA level at diagnosis (10-year survival: 97% if PSA < 4 ng/nl, 94% if 4 < PSA < 10, and 72% if PSA > 10 ng/ml), as well as a poor differentiation (60% 10-year survival compared to 90% for differentiated tumors).

For 10 patients with locally advanced head and neck (H&N) cancer and 10 with high-risk prostate cancer (PC) a VMAT plan was generated for PTV initial that included lymph node regions, delivering 50 Gy (IsoE) for H&N and 50.4 Gy (IsoE) for PC patients. Furthermore, separate boost plans (VMAT, IMPT and IMIT) were created to boost PTV boost up to 70 Gy (IsoE) and 78 Gy (IsoE) for H&N and PC cases, respectively. Doses to brainstem, myelon, larynx and parotid glands were assessed for H&N cases. Additionally, various OARs (e.g. cochlea, middle ear, masticator space) were evaluated that are currently discussed with respect to quality of life after treatment. For PC cases, bladder, rectum and femoral heads were considered as OARs. For both tumour sites target goals were easily met. Looking at OAR sparing, generally VMAT + VMAT was worst. VMAT + IMIT had the potential to spare some structures in very close target vicinity (such as cochlea, middle ear, masticator space ) significantly better than VMAT + IMPT. Mean doses for rectal and bladder wall were on average 4 Gy (IsoE) and 1.5 Gy (IsoE) higher, respectively, compared to photons plus particles scenarios.

Instead of using one planning image only, multiple scans are taken on different days. The target and organs at risk (OARs) are delineated on each images. The proposed PTV is generated from a union of those target contours on the planning images, excluding voxels of the OARs, and is denoted the PTV 'GP-OAR' (global prostate-organs at risk). The study is performed using 'plan of the day' adaptive workflow, which selects a daily plan from a library of plans based on a similarity comparison between the daily scan and planning images. The daily plans optimized for GP-OAR volumes are compared with those optimized for PTVs generated from a single prostate contour (PTV SP). Four CT serials of prostate cancer patient datasets are included in the test, and in total 28 fractions are simulated. The results show that the daily chosen GP-OAR plans provide excellent target coverage, with V95 values of the prostate mostly > 95%. In addition, dose delivered to the OARs as calculated from applying daily chosen GP-OAR plans is slightly increased but comparable to that calculated from applying daily SP plans. In general, the PTV GP-OARs are able to cover possible target variations while keeping dose delivered to the OARs at a similar level to that of the PTV SPs.""","""['Wenjing Chen', 'Alexander Gemmel', 'Eike Rietzel']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Radiat Res""","""['Optimization of treatment planning workflow and tumor coverage during daily adaptive magnetic resonance image guided radiation therapy (MR-IGRT) of pancreatic cancer.', 'Assessment and management of interfractional variations in daily diagnostic-quality-CT guided prostate-bed irradiation after prostatectomy.', 'Target miss using PTV-based IMRT compared to robust optimization via coverage probability concept in prostate cancer.', 'The role of adaptive planning in margin-reduced, MRI-guided stereotactic body radiotherapy to the prostate bed following radical prostatectomy: Post-hoc analysis of a phase II clinical trial.', 'Motion management in gastrointestinal cancers.', 'Value of Three-Dimensional Imaging Systems for Image-Guided Carbon Ion Radiotherapy.', 'Management of organ motion in scanned ion beam therapy.', 'Scanned ion beam therapy for prostate carcinoma: Comparison of single plan treatment and daily plan-adapted treatment.']"""

A special chamber has been developed to perform irradiations under different levels of oxygenation. The oxygen concentrations used were normoxia (air), hypoxia (94.5% N2, 5% CO2, 0.5% O2) and anoxia (95% N2, 5% CO2). Cells were exposed to X-rays and to C-, N- or O-ions with linear energy transfer (LET) values ranging from 100-160 keV/µm. The oxygen enhancement ratio (OER) and relative biological effectiveness (RBE) values have been calculated from the measured clonogenic survival curves. For both cell lines, the X-ray OER depended on the survival level. For particle irradiation, OER was not dependent on the survival level but decreased with increasing LET. The RBE of CHO cells under oxic conditions reached a plateau for LET values above 100 keV/µm, while it was still increasing under anoxia. In conclusion, the results demonstrated that our chamber could be used to measure radiosensitivity under intermediate hypoxia. Measurements suggest that ions heavier than carbon could be of additional advantage in the irradiation, especially of radioresistant hypoxic tumor regions.""","""['Walter Tinganelli', 'Ning-Yi Ma', 'Cläre Von Neubeck', 'Andreas Maier', 'Corinna Schicker', 'Wilma Kraft-Weyrather', 'Marco Durante']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Radiat Res""","""['DNA Repair Deficient Chinese Hamster Ovary Cells Exhibiting Differential Sensitivity to Charged Particle Radiation under Aerobic and Hypoxic Conditions.', 'Influence of chronic hypoxia and radiation quality on cell survival.', 'Inactivation of aerobic and hypoxic cells from three different cell lines by accelerated (3)He-, (12)C- and (20)Ne-ion beams.', 'Repair kinetics of DNA-DSB induced by X-rays or carbon ions under oxic and hypoxic conditions.', 'Biological effectiveness of (12)C and (20)Ne ions with very high LET.', 'Does particle radiation have superior radiobiological advantages for prostate cancer cells?

Our objective was to determine whether racial disparities are attributable to undertreatment, overtreatment, or both.  Methods:   Using the SEER-Medicare dataset, we identified men 67–84 years-old diagnosed with localized prostate cancer from 1998 to 2007. We stratified men into clinical benefit groups using tumor aggressiveness and life expectancy. Low-benefit was defined as low-risk tumors and life expectancy <10 years; high-benefit as moderate-risk tumors and life expectancy ≥10 years; all others were intermediate-benefit. Logistic regression modeled the association between race and treatment (radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy) across benefit groups.  Results:   Of 68,817 men (9.8% black and 90.2% white), 56.2% of black and 66.3% of white men received treatment (adjusted odds ratio (OR)=0.65; 95% CI, 0.62–0.69). The percent of low-, intermediate-, and high-benefit men who received treatment was 56.7%, 68.4%, and 79.6%, respectively (P=<0.001). In the low-benefit group, 51.9% of black vs. 57.2% of white patients received treatment (OR=0.74; 95% CI, 0.67–0.81) compared to 57.2% vs. 69.6% in the intermediate-benefit group (OR=0.64; 95% CI, 0.59–0.70). Racial disparity was largest in the high-benefit group (64.2% of black vs. 81.4% of white patients received treatment; OR=0.57; 95% CI, 0.48–0.68). The interaction between race and clinical benefit was significant (P<0.001).  Conclusion:   Racial disparities were largest among men most likely to benefit from treatment.

However, few papers have made clear associations among BSI, bone metabolic markers, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA). This retrospective study aimed to examine these relationships in prostate cancer patients with bone metastases.  Methods:   A total of 158 scans from 52 patients (number of median examinations/person 3, range 1-8; median age 71 years, age range 46-86) were included. The intervals between bone scans and blood examinations were 0-16 days (median 0 day). The serum markers of PSA, pyridinoline cross-linked carboxy-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (1-CTP), bone alkaline phosphatase (BAP), and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-5b (TRACP-5b) were examined. Subjects were divided into 4 groups according to BSI; Group A: 0 to <2, Group B: 2 to <4, Group C: 4 to <8, and Group D: over 8. BSI, which corresponded to the amount of metastatic lesion, was automatically calculated by BONENAVI(®) software (FUJIFILM RI Pharma, Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan; Exini Bone, Exini Diagnostics, Sweden).  Results:   All bone scans showed high uptake with bone metastases. BSI was correlated significantly with the serum 1-CTP, serum BAP, serum TRACP-5b, logBAP, logTRACP-5b, and logPSA (r = 0.39, 0.66, 0.69, 0.71, 0.62 and 0.41, respectively). BSI did not correlate significantly with the serum PSA. The statistical F value was 11 in the serum 1-CTP, 31 in serum BAP, 29 in logBAP, 19 in serum TRACP-5b, 14 in logTRACP-5b, 3 in serum PSA, and 9 in logPSA by analysis of variance. Comparison by Dunnett's test showed significantly higher values in Group D for all original bone metabolic markers and the logPSA, Group C for the serum BAP, logBAP, serum TRACP-5b, and logTRACP-5b, and Group B for the logTRACP-5b compared with Group A.  Conclusion:   The changes in BSI showed a close relationship with all bone metabolic markers but not with the serum PSA.

Our earlier studies showed that red beetroot (Beta vulgaris L.) extract (B), approved by Food and Drug Administration and European Union as red food color E162, reduced multi-organ tumor formations in various animal models when administered in drinking water. This led us to postulate that a long-term daily exposure to low doses of B through diet might be safe and sufficient to produce cancer chemopreventive effect in humans. Further, our recent comparative cytotoxic investigation with B and D in several human cancer cell lines indicated their potential for synergistic activity. Since B is considered safe for human use with no known toxicity, we conducted the present study to evaluate its synergistic antiproliferative activity with D against pancreatic (PaCa), breast (MCF-7) and prostate (PC-3) tumor cells of human origin. Different concentrations of B and D (0.29-290 μg/ml) and in various combinations (B:D ratio = 1:0, 1:1, 5:1, 1:5 and 0:1) were tested for cytotoxic effects against the three cancer cells. The viability of cells was assessed after 72 h incubation with various combinations of B and D using the trypan-blue staining method. The cytotoxic data were analyzed by the combination index method of Chou and Talalay to establish synergy between B and D. The results indicated that an overall positive reduction in drug concentration was achieved by D when combined with B in its cytotoxicity profile in the three human cancer cells tested. The synergistic cytotoxicity was best when the B:D ratio of 1:5 was used in PaCa cells at IC50, IC75 and IC90 dose levels and in MCF-7 cells at IC90 dose level.

Intra-operative and postoperative complications, assessed according to the modified Clavien system, were recorded and peri-operative and functional outcome data were analysed. All patients were followed up for a minimum of 12 months postoperatively through PSA detection, daily pads, the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF)-6 score and urography.  Results:   All of the 16 STLRP procedures were successfully completed. The mean (range) operation duration was 105 (75-180) min, and the mean (range) estimated blood loss was 130 (75-500) mL. No patients had positive surgical margins. Postoperative complications occurred in five patients, including three cases of urinary infection and two cases of haematuria (grade II). Catheters were removed after a mean (range) time of 11.2 (9-14) days with cystography. The mean (range) hospital stay was 12.7 (10-15) days. Of the 16 patients, 13 were immediately continent (0 pads/day), and three had mild incontinence (2-3 pads/day) after catheter removal. All patients were observed as continent 3 months postoperatively. In total, 10/16 and 12/16 patients achieved a satisfactory erection at 6 and 12 months follow-up postoperatively, respectively, with an IIEF-6 score ≥ 18. The mean postoperative PSA levels at 3, 6 and 12 months were 0.015 ng/mL, 0.017 ng/mL and 0.016 ng/mL, respectively. No patients were identified with biochemical recurrence in this series. No patients demonstrated vesico-urethral stricture during follow-up for 12-24 months.  Conclusions:   We conclude that STLRP is technically feasible for patients with low-risk organ-confined prostate cancer and demonstrates promising functional outcomes regarding continence and potency.""","""['Xin Gao', 'Jun Pang', 'Jie Si-tu', 'Yun Luo', 'Hao Zhang', 'Liao-yuan Li', 'Yan Zhang']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Operative details and oncological and functional outcome of robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy: 400 cases with a minimum of 12 months follow-up.', 'Functional outcomes of transvesical single-site versus extraperitoneal laparoscopic radical prostatectomy for low-risk prostate cancer.', 'Transvesical single-site laparoscopic radical prostatectomy of 39 cases: technique and clinical outcomes.', 'Long-term oncological outcomes after laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.', 'Extraperitoneal radical prostatectomy Da Vinci.', 'Transvesical Versus Posterior Approach to Retzius-Sparing Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy: A Retrospective Comparison With a 12-Month Follow-Up.', 'Prostate cancer in Asia: A collaborative report.', 'Laparoscopic Approach for Intravesical Surgery Using Pneumovesicum in Urology: Literature Review.', 'Single port radical prostatectomy: current status.']"""

Patients and methods:   This parallel, two-group, multicentre, randomised controlled feasibility trial enrolled men with histologically confirmed localised, low-risk prostate cancer and good performance status from five UK hospitals. Participants were randomly allocated (1:1) by remote computer allocation to receive a decision aid (DA) DVD or standard information (control group), followed by a second randomisation (1:1) to brachytherapy or RP. There was no 'blinding' of staff or patients. Primary outcome was feasibility: a recruitment rate of six patients per centre over the last 6 months of recruitment would deem a phase III trial feasible.  Results:   Between May 2009 and May 2011, 30 patients were randomised (15 in the DA group and 15 in the control group), and four continued to the second treatment randomisation (one from the DA group and three from the control group). One patient was allocated and received brachytherapy and three RP. SABRE 1 closed early due to poor recruitment. All patients were analysed. Screening logbook analysis showed that the main reasons for declining trial entry were a wish to choose treatment or opting for active monitoring. Results from the DA questionnaire (completed by 10 men) showed that four of the men 'felt surgery and radiotherapy had been proven in a high quality trial' and seven felt 'they should make their treatment decision while knowing their doctors opinion'.  Conclusion:   Recruitment to a RP vs brachytherapy trial in localised prostate cancer was not feasible by the use of this two-step randomisation using a DA and previous trials in early prostate cancer have had similar difficulties in recruitment, with only a few achieving their accrual target. The best treatment method for treating low-risk prostate cancer is still unproven in a head-to-head trial and the increasing number of options will make choices correspondingly more difficulty without good quality comparative research. More sophisticated techniques for recruitment may be more successful in future trials in this patient population.""","""['Bryony K Eccles', 'William Cross', 'Derek J Rosario', 'Andrew Doble', 'Chris Parker', 'John Logue', 'Louisa Little', 'Louise Stanton', 'David Bottomley']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Management of localised prostate cancer: watchful waiting, surgery or radiation therapy, depending on the natural course, which is often relatively slow.', 'Partial ablation versus radical prostatectomy in intermediate-risk prostate cancer: the PART feasibility RCT.', 'Active monitoring, radical prostatectomy and radical radiotherapy in PSA-detected clinically localised prostate cancer: the ProtecT three-arm RCT.', 'Choice between prostatectomy and radiotherapy when men are eligible for both: a randomized controlled trial of usual care vs decision aid.', 'Controversies in prostate cancer radiotherapy: consensus development.', 'Direct Comparison of Two Different Definitions with Biochemical Recurrence after Low-Dose-Rate Brachytherapy for Prostate Cancer.', 'Direct comparison of low-dose-rate brachytherapy versus radical prostatectomy using the surgical definition of biochemical recurrence for patients with intermediate-risk prostate cancer.', 'Recruitment strategies in randomised controlled trials of men aged 50 years and older: a systematic review.', 'The comparative oncologic effectiveness of available management strategies for clinically localized prostate cancer.', 'Focal salvage therapy for local prostate cancer recurrences after primary radiotherapy: a comprehensive review.']"""

To evaluate the potential reduction in unnecessary biopsies and the characteristics of potentially missed cases of PCa that would result from using serum p2PSA, %p2PSA and PHI.  Patients and methods:   The analysis consisted of a nested case-control study from the PRO-PSA Multicentric European Study, the PROMEtheuS project. All patients had a first-degree relative (father, brother, son) with PCa. Multivariable logistic regression models were complemented by predictive accuracy analysis and decision-curve analysis.  Results:   Of the 1026 patients included in the PROMEtheuS cohort, 158 (15.4%) had a first-degree relative with PCa. p2PSA, %p2PSA and PHI values were significantly higher (P < 0.001), and free/total PSA (%fPSA) values significantly lower (P < 0.001) in the 71 patients with PCa (44.9%) than in patients without PCa. Univariable accuracy analysis showed %p2PSA (area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve [AUC]: 0.733) and PHI (AUC: 0.733) to be the most accurate predictors of PCa at biopsy, significantly outperforming total PSA ([tPSA] AUC: 0.549), free PSA ([fPSA] AUC: 0.489) and %fPSA (AUC: 0.600) (P ≤ 0.001). For %p2PSA a threshold of 1.66 was found to have the best balance between sensitivity and specificity (70.4 and 70.1%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 58.4-80.7 and 59.4-79.5 respectively). A PHI threshold of 40 was found to have the best balance between sensitivity and specificity (64.8 and 71.3%, respectively; 95% CI 52.5-75.8 and 60.6-80.5). At 90% sensitivity, the thresholds for %p2PSA and PHI were 1.20 and 25.5, with a specificity of 37.9 and 25.5%, respectively. At a %p2PSA threshold of 1.20, a total of 39 (24.8%) biopsies could have been avoided, but two cancers with a Gleason score (GS) of 7 would have been missed. At a PHI threshold of 25.5 a total of 27 (17.2%) biopsies could have been avoided and two (3.8%) cancers with a GS of 7 would have been missed. In multivariable logistic regression models, %p2PSA and PHI achieved independent predictor status and significantly increased the accuracy of multivariable models including PSA and prostate volume by 8.7 and 10%, respectively (P ≤ 0.001). p2PSA, %p2PSA and PHI were directly correlated with Gleason score (ρ: 0.247, P = 0.038; ρ: 0.366, P = 0.002; ρ: 0.464, P < 0.001, respectively).

Patients and methods:   From March 2003 to August 2010, 50 men with biopsy-proven unilateral (n = 25) or bilateral (n = 25) radio-recurrent PCa underwent SFC or STC, respectively. Patients were assessed after treatment by prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing, transrectal ultrasonography, biopsy and questionnaires. Biochemical failure (BF) was defined using the Phoenix criteria (PSA nadir + 2 mg/mL). Data were prospectively collected and retrospectively analysed.  Results:   The median pre-cryoablation PSA level and Gleason score were, respectively, 2.8 ng/mL and 7 for SFC, and 3.9 ng/mL and 7 for STC. The median follow-up was 31 and 53 months (P = 0.004) for SFC and STC, respectively. Oncological outcomes were as follows: no patient died; one patient who underwent STC developed bone metastases; eight patients who underwent SFC and three who underwent STC had BF and the 5-year BF-free survival rates were 54 and 86%, respectively. In those patients without BF, the mean PSA decreased by 86% for SFC and 90% for STC within the first year and remained stable. Functional outcomes were as follows: new onset urinary incontinence occurred in three (13%) patients in the STC group, whereas no patient in the SFC group developed incontinence (P = 0.10); Two of seven patients in the SFC group retained postoperative potency, but none of the four potent patients in the STC group recovered potency postoperatively (P = 0.48); one (4%) patient in the STC group developed a recto-urethral fistula, but none occurred in the SFC group (P = 0.48).  Conclusions:   SFC and STC are feasible and safe with acceptable mid-term oncological outcomes. For carefully selected patients, SFC is an option that could be associated with lower treatment-related morbidity compared with STC.

In this study, we identified the tumor suppressor Deleted in liver cancer 1 (DLC1) as a target of repression by EZH2-mediated H3K27me3. DLC1 is a GTPase-activating protein for Rho family proteins. Inactivation of DLC1 results in hyper-activated Rho/ROCK signaling and is implicated in actin cytoskeleton reorganization to promote cancer metastasis. By chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, we demonstrated that H3K27me3 was significantly enriched at the DLC1 promoter region of a DLC1-nonexpressing HCC cell line, MHCC97L. Depletion of EZH2 in MHCC97L by shRNA reduced H3K27me3 level at DLC1 promoter and induced DLC1 gene re-expression. Conversely, transient overexpression of GFP-EZH2 in DLC1-expressing Huh7 cells reduced DLC1 mRNA level with a concomitant enrichment of EZH2 on DLC1 promoter. An inverse relation between EZH2 and DLC1 expression was observed in the liver, lung, breast, prostate, and ovarian cancer tissues. Treating cancer cells with the EZH2 small molecular inhibitor, 3-Deazaneplanocin A (DZNep), restored DLC1 expression in different cancer cell lines, indicating that EZH2-mediated H3K27me3 epigenetic regulation of DLC1 was a common mechanism in human cancers. Importantly, we found that DZNep treatment inhibited HCC cell migration through disrupting actin cytoskeleton network, suggesting the therapeutic potential of DZNep in targeting cancer metastasis. Taken together, our study has shed mechanistic insight into EZH2-H3K27me3 epigenetic repression of DLC1 and advocated the significant pro-metastatic role of EZH2 via repressing tumor and metastasis suppressors.""","""['Sandy Leung-Kuen Au', 'Carmen Chak-Lui Wong', 'Joyce Man-Fong Lee', 'Chun-Ming Wong', 'Irene Oi-Lin Ng']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['LINC00114 stimulates growth and glycolysis of esophageal cancer cells by recruiting EZH2 to enhance H3K27me3 of DLC1.', 'EZH2-induced H3K27me3 is associated with epigenetic repression of the ARHI tumor-suppressor gene in ovarian cancer.', 'Curcumin inhibits the growth of triple-negative breast cancer cells by silencing EZH2 and restoring DLC1 expression.', 'EZH2: a novel target for cancer treatment.', 'EZH2-Targeted Therapies in Cancer: Hype or a Reality.', 'Depletion of enhancer zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) directs transcription factors associated with T cell differentiation through epigenetic regulation of Yin Yang 1(YY1) in combating non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).', 'LINC00114 stimulates growth and glycolysis of esophageal cancer cells by recruiting EZH2 to enhance H3K27me3 of DLC1.', 'Inhibition of cytoplasmic EZH2 induces antitumor activity through stabilization of the DLC1 tumor suppressor protein.', 'Inhibition of EZH2 enhances the therapeutic effect of 5-FU via PUMA upregulation in colorectal cancer.', 'Small Ones to Fight a Big Problem-Intervention of Cancer Metastasis by Small Molecules.']"""

We hypothesized that seminal plasma is a robust source of novel prostate cancer (PCa) biomarkers with the potential to improve primary diagnosis of and to distinguish advanced from indolent disease.  Methodology/principal findings:   In an open-label case/control study 125 patients (70 PCa, 21 benign prostate hyperplasia, 25 chronic prostatitis, 9 healthy controls) were enrolled in 3 centres. Biomarker panels a) for PCa diagnosis (comparison of PCa patients versus benign controls) and b) for advanced disease (comparison of patients with post surgery Gleason score <7 versus Gleason score >7) were sought. Independent cohorts were used for proteomic biomarker discovery and testing the performance of the identified biomarker profiles. Seminal plasma was profiled using capillary electrophoresis mass spectrometry. Pre-analytical stability and analytical precision of the proteome analysis were determined. Support vector machine learning was used for classification. Stepwise application of two biomarker signatures with 21 and 5 biomarkers provided 83% sensitivity and 67% specificity for PCa detection in a test set of samples. A panel of 11 biomarkers for advanced disease discriminated between patients with Gleason score 7 and organ-confined (<pT3a) or advanced (≥pT3a) disease with 80% sensitivity and 82% specificity in a preliminary validation setting. Seminal profiles showed excellent pre-analytical stability. Eight biomarkers were identified as fragments of N-acetyllactosaminide beta-1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase, prostatic acid phosphatase, stabilin-2, GTPase IMAP family member 6, semenogelin-1 and -2.

In a recent genome-wide analysis of prostate cancer cells we identified distinctive gene expression profiles controlled by individual PKC isozymes and highlighted a prominent role for PKCδ in transcriptional activation.  Principal findings:   Here we carried out a thorough bioinformatics analysis to dissect transcriptional networks controlled by PKCα, PKCδ, and PKCε, the main diacylglycerol/phorbol ester PKCs expressed in prostate cancer cells. Despite the remarkable differences in the patterns of transcriptional responsive elements (REs) regulated by each PKC, we found that c-Rel represents the most frequent RE in promoters regulated by all three PKCs. In addition, promoters of PKCδ-regulated genes were particularly enriched with REs for CREB, NF-E2, RREB, SRF, Oct-1, Evi-1, and NF-κB. Most notably, by using transcription factor-specific RNAi we were able to identify subsets of PKCδ-regulated genes modulated by c-Rel and CREB. Furthermore, PKCδ-regulated genes condensed under the c-Rel transcriptional regulation display significant functional interconnections with biological processes such as angiogenesis, inflammatory response, and cell motility.  Conclusion/significance:   Our study identified candidate transcription factors in the promoters of PKC regulated genes, in particular c-Rel was found as a key transcription factor in the control of PKCδ-regulated genes.

A training set was used to develop a random forest classifier of 22 markers to predict for cases--men with early clinical metastasis after rising PSA. Performance of GC was compared to prognostic factors such as Gleason score and previous gene expression signatures in a withheld validation set.  Results:   Expression profiles were generated from 545 unique patient samples, with median follow-up of 16.9 years. GC achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.75 (0.67-0.83) in validation, outperforming clinical variables and gene signatures. GC was the only significant prognostic factor in multivariable analyses. Within Gleason score groups, cases with high GC scores experienced earlier death from prostate cancer and reduced overall survival. The markers in the classifier were found to be associated with a number of key biological processes in prostate cancer metastatic disease progression.  Conclusion:   A genomic classifier was developed and validated in a large patient cohort enriched with prostate cancer metastasis patients and a rising PSA that went on to experience metastatic disease. This early metastasis prediction model based on genomic expression in the primary tumor may be useful for identification of aggressive prostate cancer.""","""['Nicholas Erho', 'Anamaria Crisan', 'Ismael A Vergara', 'Anirban P Mitra', 'Mercedeh Ghadessi', 'Christine Buerki', 'Eric J Bergstralh', 'Thomas Kollmeyer', 'Stephanie Fink', 'Zaid Haddad', 'Benedikt Zimmermann', 'Thomas Sierocinski', 'Karla V Ballman', 'Timothy J Triche', 'Peter C Black', 'R Jeffrey Karnes', 'George Klee', 'Elai Davicioni', 'Robert B Jenkins']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Combined value of validated clinical and genomic risk stratification tools for predicting prostate cancer mortality in a high-risk prostatectomy cohort.', 'Validation of a genomic classifier that predicts metastasis following radical prostatectomy in an at risk patient population.', 'Tissue-based Genomics Augments Post-prostatectomy Risk Stratification in a Natural History Cohort of Intermediate- and High-Risk Men.', 'Individual Patient-Level Meta-Analysis of the Performance of the Decipher Genomic Classifier in High-Risk Men After Prostatectomy to Predict Development of Metastatic Disease.', 'Validation of proposed prostate cancer biomarkers with gene expression data: a long road to travel.', 'Genomic and Phenotypic Biomarkers for Precision Medicine Guidance in Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'A harmonized resource of integrated prostate cancer clinical, -omic, and signature features.', 'Radiogenomic profiling of prostate tumors prior to external beam radiotherapy converges on a transcriptomic signature of TGF-β activity driving tumor recurrence.', 'Accurate prognosis for localized prostate cancer through coherent voting networks with multi-omic and clinical data.', 'ZNF750: A Novel Prognostic Biomarker in Metastatic Prostate Cancer.']"""

However, the application of age-specific PSA remains poorly understood in China.  Methods:   Between 2003 and 2012, 1,848 men over the age of 40, underwent prostate biopsy for prostate cancer (PCa) at Huashan Hospital, Shanghai, China. Clinical information and blood samples were collected prior to biopsy for each patient. Men were divided into three age groups (≤60, 61 to 80, and >80) for analyses. Digital rectal examination (DRE), transrectal ultrasound (prostate volume and nodule), total PSA (tPSA), and free PSA (fPSA) were also included in the analyses. Logistic regression was used to build the multi-variate model.  Results:   Serum tPSA levels were age-dependent (P = 0.008), while %fPSA (P = 0.051) and PSAD (P = 0.284) were age-independent. At a specificity of 80%, the sensitivities for predicting PCa were 83%, 71% and 68% with tPSA cutoff values of 19.0 ng/mL (age≤60),21.0 ng/mL (age 61-80), and 23.0 ng/mL (age≥81). Also, sensitivities at the same tPSA levels were able to reach relatively high levels (70%-88%) for predicting high-grade PCa. Area (AUC) under the receive operating curves (ROCs) of tPSA, %fPSA, PSAD and multi-variate model were different in age groups. When predicting PCa, the AUC of tPSA, %fPSA, PSAD and multi-variate model were 0.90, 0.57, 0.93 and 0.87 respectively in men ≤60 yr; 0.82, 0.70, 0.88 and 0.86 respectively in men 61-80 yr; 0.79, 0.78, 0.87 and 0.88 respectively in men>80 yr. When predicting Gleason Score ≥7 or 8 PCa, there were no significant differences between AUCs of each variable.  Conclusion:   Age-specific PSA cutoff values for prostate biopsy should be considered in the Chinese population. Indications for prostate biopsies (tPSA, %fPSA and PSAD) should be considered based on age in the Chinese population.""","""['Rong Na', 'Yishuo Wu', 'Jianfeng Xu', 'Haowen Jiang', 'Qiang Ding']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Outcomes and trends of prostate biopsy for prostate cancer in Chinese men from 2003 to 2011.', 'Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) isoform p2PSA significantly improves the prediction of prostate cancer at initial extended prostate biopsies in patients with total PSA between 2.0 and 10 ng/ml: results of a prospective study in a clinical setting.', 'Complexed prostate-specific antigen, complexed prostate-specific antigen density of total and transition zone, complexed/total prostate-specific antigen ratio, free-to-total prostate-specific antigen ratio, density of total and transition zone prostate-specific antigen: results of the prospective multicenter European trial.', 'Performance of serum prostate-specific antigen isoform -2proPSA (p2PSA) and the prostate health index (PHI) in a Chinese hospital-based biopsy population.', 'Prostate health index vs percent free prostate-specific antigen for prostate cancer detection in men with ""gray"" prostate-specific antigen levels at first biopsy: systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Phi-based risk calculators performed better in the prediction of prostate cancer in the Chinese population.', 'Evaluation of PSA-age volume score in predicting prostate cancer in Chinese population.', 'The Huashan risk calculators performed better in prediction of prostate cancer in Chinese population: a training study followed by a validation study.', 'Influence of age on seven putative prostate tumor markers: a cohort study in Chinese men.', 'Influence of age on predictiveness of genetic risk score for prostate cancer in a Chinese hospital-based biopsy cohort.']"""

The apoptotic effects of lovastatin were regulated in part by the integrated stress response (ISR) that regulates cellular responses to a wide variety of stress inducers. A key regulator of the ISR apoptotic response is activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) and its target gene CHOP/GADD153. In our study, we demonstrate that in multiple lovastatin-resistant clones of the squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cell line SCC9, lovastatin treatment (1-25 μM, 24 hr) in contrast to the parental line failed to significantly induce ATF3 expression. Furthermore, the SCC-derived cell lines SCC25 and HeLa that are sensitive to lovastatin-induced apoptosis also preferentially induce ATF3 expression compared to resistant breast (MCF-7) and prostate carcinoma (PC3)-derived cell lines. In HeLa cells shRNA targeting ATF3 expression as well as in ATF3-deficient murine embryonic fibroblasts, lovastatin-induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis were attenuated. In ex vivo HNSCC tumors, lovastatin also induced ATF3 mRNA expression in two of four tumors evaluated. Salubrinal, an agent that can sustain the activity of a key regulator of the ISR eIF2α, further increased the expression of ATF3 and demonstrated synergistic cytotoxicity in combination with lovastatin in SCC cells. Taken together, our results demonstrate preferential induction of ATF3 in lovastatin-sensitive tumor-derived cell lines that regulate lovastatin-induced apoptosis.

Because the treatment is given by indication, estimating the effect of the hormone therapy is challenging. In a previous paper we described two methods for estimating the treatment effect, called two-stage and sequential stratification. The two-stage method involved modeling the longitudinal and survival data. The sequential stratification method involves contrasts within matched sets of people, where each matched set includes people who did and did not receive hormone therapy. In this paper, we evaluate the properties of these two methods and compare and contrast them with the marginal structural model methodology. The marginal structural model methodology involves a weighted survival analysis, where the weights are derived from models for the time of hormone therapy. We highlight the different conditional and marginal interpretations of the quantities being estimated by the three methods. Using simulations that mimic the prostate cancer setting, we evaluate bias, efficiency, and accuracy of estimated standard errors and robustness to modeling assumptions. The results show differences between the methods in terms of the quantities being estimated and in efficiency.

We recently demonstrated that the tumor suppressor role of TMEFF2 correlates, in part, with its ability to interact with sarcosine dehydrogenase (SARDH) and modulate sarcosine level. TMEFF2 overexpression inhibits sarcosine-induced invasion. Here, we further characterize the functional interaction between TMEFF2 and SARDH and their link with one-carbon (1-C) metabolism and invasion.  Methods:   RNA interference was used to study the effect of SARDH and/or TMEFF2 knockdown (KD) in invasion, evaluated using Boyden chambers. The dependence of invasion on 1-C metabolism was determined by examining sensitivity to methotrexate. Real-time PCR and Western blot of subcellular fractions were used to study the effect of SARDH KD or TMEFF2 KD on expression of enzymes involved in one-carbon (1-C) metabolism and on TMEFF2 expression and localization. Protein interactions were analyzed by mass spectrometry. Cell viability and proliferation were measured by cell counting and MTT analysis.  Results:   While knocking down SARDH affects TMEFF2 subcellular localization, this effect is not responsible for the increased invasion observed in SARDH KD cells. Importantly, SARDH and/or TMEFF2 KD promote increased cellular invasion, sensitize the cell to methotrexate, render the cell resistant to invasion induced by sarcosine, a metabolite from the folate-mediated 1-C metabolism pathway, and affect the expression level of enzymes involved in that pathway.

Recent studies have identified a biochemical signature of prostate cancer metastasis, including increased sarcosine abundance. This study examined the association of tissue metabolites with other clinically significant findings.  Methods:   A state of the art metabolomics platform analyzed prostatectomy tissues (331 prostate tumor, 178 cancer-free prostate tissues) from two independent sites. Biochemicals were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Statistical analyses identified metabolites associated with cancer aggressiveness: Gleason score, extracapsular extension, and seminal vesicle and lymph node involvement.  Results:   Prostate tumors had significantly altered metabolite profiles compared to cancer-free prostate tissues, including biochemicals associated with cell growth, energetics, stress, and loss of prostate-specific biochemistry. Many metabolites were further associated with clinical findings of aggressive disease. Aggressiveness-associated metabolites stratified prostate tumor tissues with high abundances of compounds associated with normal prostate function (e.g., citrate and polyamines) from more clinically advanced prostate tumors. These aggressive prostate tumors were further subdivided by abundance profiles of metabolites including NAD+ and kynurenine. When added to multiparametric nomograms, metabolites improved prediction of organ confinement (AUROC from 0.53 to 0.62) and 5-year recurrence (AUROC from 0.53 to 0.64).

Piperine, a major alkaloid constituent of black pepper, has previously been reported to have anti-cancer activity in variety of cancer cell lines. The effect of piperine against prostate cancer is not currently known. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the anti-tumor mechanisms of piperine on androgen dependent and androgen independent prostate cancer cells. Here, we show that piperine inhibited the proliferation of LNCaP, PC-3, 22RV1 and DU-145 prostate cancer cells in a dose dependent manner. Furthermore, Annexin-V staining demonstrated that piperine treatment induced apoptosis in hormone dependent prostate cancer cells (LNCaP). Using global caspase activation assay, we show that piperine-induced apoptosis resulted in caspase activation in LNCaP and PC-3 cells. Further studies revealed that piperine treatment resulted in the activation of caspase-3 and cleavage of PARP-1 proteins in LNCaP, PC-3 and DU-145 prostate cancer cells. Piperine treatment also disrupted androgen receptor (AR) expression in LNCaP prostate cancer cells. Our evaluations further show that there is a significant reduction of Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) levels following piperine treatment in LNCaP cells. NF-kB and STAT-3 transcription factors have previously been shown to play a role in angiogenesis and invasion of prostate cancer cells. Interestingly, treatment of LNCaP, PC-3 and DU-145 prostate cancer cells with piperine resulted in reduced expression of phosphorylated STAT-3 and Nuclear factor-κB (NF-kB) transcription factors. These results correlated with the results of Boyden chamber assay, wherein piperine treatment reduced the cell migration of LNCaP and PC-3 cells. Finally, we show that piperine treatment significantly reduced the androgen dependent and androgen independent tumor growth in nude mice model xenotransplanted with prostate cancer cells. Taken together, these results support further investigation of piperine as a potential therapeutic agent in the treatment of prostate cancer.""","""['Abhilash Samykutty', 'Aditya Vittal Shetty', 'Gajalakshmi Dakshinamoorthy', 'Mary Margaret Bartik', 'Gary Leon Johnson', 'Brian Webb', 'Guoxing Zheng', 'Aoshuang Chen', 'Ramaswamy Kalyanasundaram', 'Gnanasekar Munirathinam']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Piperine blocks voltage gated K+ current and inhibits proliferation in androgen sensitive and insensitive human prostate cancer cell lines.', 'Potential of piperine in modulation of voltage-gated K+ current and its influences on cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in human prostate cancer cells.', 'Piperine Inhibits Cell Proliferation and Induces Apoptosis of Human Gastric Cancer Cells by Downregulating Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase (PI3K)/Akt Pathway.', 'Black pepper and its bioactive constituent piperine: promising therapeutic strategies for oral lichen planus.', 'Piper nigrum and piperine: an update.', 'Research Trend and Detailed Insights into the Molecular Mechanisms of Food Bioactive Compounds against Cancer: A Comprehensive Review with Special Emphasis on Probiotics.', 'Phytochemicals in Inhibition of Prostate Cancer: Evidence from Molecular Mechanisms Studies.', 'Combination Anticancer Therapies Using Selected Phytochemicals.', 'Gambogic Acid and Piperine Synergistically Induce Apoptosis in Human Cholangiocarcinoma Cell via Caspase and Mitochondria-Mediated Pathway.', 'Molecular and pharmacological aspects of piperine as a potential molecule for disease prevention and management: evidence from clinical trials.']"""

Pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for rs198977 and PCa were calculated in a fixed-effects model (the Mantel-Haenszel method) and a random-effects model (the DerSimonian and Laird method) when appropriate.

Follow-up prostate-specific antigen and death data were obtained via record linkage to pathology laboratories and the Victorian Registry of Births, Deaths and Marriages. Poisson regression models with PCSM as the outcome were fit to the data. Models included age at surgery, Gleason score and tumour stage as covariates.  Results:   Median post-surgery and post-BCR follow-up was 10.3 and 7.5 years, respectively. 695 men (33 %) experienced BCR during follow-up, of which 82 % occurred within 5 years of RP; 66 men died from prostate cancer. Men with combined high Gleason sum (≥4 + 3) and extra-prostatic (≥pT3a) disease had substantially increased mortality rate with early BCR, while those experiencing BCR after a longer interval had significantly lower mortality. Men with combined low Gleason sum (≤3 + 4) and organ-confined disease (≤pT2c) risk disease were not at any substantial risk of death in this time frame regardless of timing of BCR following RP.  Conclusions:   This study evaluates the temporal relationship between BCR and PCSM using a whole-of-population cohort of men treated with RP. Men with low-risk features of prostate cancer at time of RP have low mortality even if they experience early BCR.

Early results in patients with local failure of prostate cancer after radiation therapy""","""Purpose:   To assess the overall clinical outcome of protocol-based image-guided salvage pulsed-dose-rate brachytherapy for locally recurrent prostate cancer after radiotherapy failure particularly regarding feasibility and side effects.  Patients and methods:   Eighteen consecutive patients with locally recurrent prostate cancer (median age, 69 years) were treated during 2005-2011 with interstitial PDR brachytherapy (PDR-BT) as salvage brachytherapy after radiotherapy failure. The treatment schedule was PDR-BT two times with 30 Gy (pulse dose 0.6 Gy/h, 24 h per day) corresponding to a total dose of 60 Gy. Dose volume adaptation was performed with the aim of optimal coverage of the whole prostate (V100 > 95 %) simultaneously respecting the protocol-based dose volume constraints for the urethra (D0.1 cc < 130 %) and the rectum (D2 cc < 50-60 %) taking into account the previous radiation therapy. Local relapse after radiotherapy (external beam irradiation, brachytherapy with J-125 seeds or combination) was confirmed mostly via choline-PET and increased PSA levels. The primary endpoint was treatment-related late toxicities--particularly proctitis, anal incontinence, cystitis, urinary incontinence, urinary frequency/urgency, and urinary retention according to the Common Toxicity Criteria. The secondary endpoint was PSA-recurrence-free survival.  Results:   We registered urinary toxicities only. Grade 2 and grade 3 toxicities were observed in up to 11.1 % (2/18) and 16.7 % (3/18) of patients, respectively. The most frequent late-event grade 3 toxicity was urinary retention in 17 % (3/18) of patients. No late gastrointestinal side effects occurred. The biochemical PSA-recurrence-free survival probability at 3 years was 57.1 %. The overall survival at 3 years was 88.9 %; 22 % (4/18) of patients developed metastases. The median follow-up time for all patients after salvage BT was 21 months (range, 8-77 months).  Conclusion:   Salvage PDR-brachytherapy of the prostate following local failure after radiation therapy is a treatment option with a low rate of genitourinary side effects and no late gastrointestinal side effects.

We hypothesized that combining calorie restriction with IGF-1R blockade would have an additive effect on prostate cancer growth. Severe combined immunodeficient mice were subcutaneously injected with 22Rv1 cells and randomized to: (1) Ad libitum feeding/intraperitoneal saline (Ad-lib); (2) Ad-lib/20 mg/kg twice weekly, intraperitoneal ganitumab [anti-IGF-1R antibody (Ad-lib/Ab)]; (3) 40% calorie restriction/intraperitoneal saline (CR); (4) CR/ intraperitoneal ganitumab, (CR/Ab). CR and ganitumab treatment were initiated one week after tumor injection. Euthanasia occurred 19 days post treatment. Results showed that CR alone decreased final tumor weight, plasma insulin and IGF-1 levels, and increased apoptosis. Ganitumab therapy alone reduced tumor growth but had no effect on final tumor weight. The combination therapy (CR/Ab) further decreased final tumor weight and proliferation, increased apoptosis in comparison to the Ad-lib group, and lowered plasma insulin levels relative to the Ad-lib and Ad-lib/Ab groups. Tumor AKT activation directly correlated with plasma IGF-1 levels. In conclusion, whereas ganitumab therapy modestly affected 22Rv1 tumor growth, combining IGF-1R blockade with calorie restriction resulted in a significant decrease in final tumor weight and improved metabolic profile.""","""['Colette Galet', 'Ashley Gray', 'Jonathan W Said', 'Brandon Castor', 'Junxiang Wan', 'Pedro J Beltran', 'Franck J Calzone', 'David Elashoff', 'Pinchas Cohen', 'William J Aronson']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Int J Mol Sci""","""['Effect of a low-fat diet combined with IGF-1 receptor blockade on 22Rv1 prostate cancer xenografts.', 'Targeting IGF-IR with ganitumab inhibits tumorigenesis and increases durability of response to androgen-deprivation therapy in VCaP prostate cancer xenografts.', 'A novel calcium-dependent mechanism of acquired resistance to IGF-1 receptor inhibition in prostate cancer cells.', 'Ganitumab (AMG 479) inhibits IGF-II-dependent ovarian cancer growth and potentiates platinum-based chemotherapy.', 'Targeting the IGF-1R in prostate and colorectal cancer: reasons behind trial failure and future directions.', 'Emerging Role of IGF-1 in Prostate Cancer: A Promising Biomarker and Therapeutic Target.', 'White adipose tissue-derived factors and prostate cancer progression: mechanisms and targets for interventions.', 'Do Cancer and Cancer Treatments Accelerate Aging?', 'Avenues of research in dietary interventions to target tumor metabolism in osteosarcoma.', 'The Role of Diet in Cancer Prevention and Chemotherapy Efficacy.']"""

The high-resolution crystal structures of two different crystal forms of isoform II verified the β-trefoil fold of CrataBL and have shown the presence of dimers consisting of two almost identical molecules making extensive contacts (∼645 Å(2)). The structure differs from those of the most closely related proteins by the lack of the N-terminal β-hairpin.

Methods:   A total of 236 patients who underwent SRT without receiving concomitant androgen deprivation therapy at a single institution after BR post-RP were retrospectively reviewed. The Kaplan-Meier methods and log-rank analysis were used to determine the MFS rates.  Results:   Median follow-up post-SRT was 7.1 years. As of last follow-up, 59 men (25%) had developed metastasis. On univariate analysis, both GS and PSADT predicted MFS (P<0.001). Five- and 10-year rates of MFS were calculated for patients with GS 2 to 6, 7, and 8 to 10 and for patients with PSADT < 3, 3 to 9, 9 to 15, and >15 months, who received no additional salvage therapy until the development of metastases. The 5- and 10-year MFS for GS 8 to 10 were 62% and 50%, respectively, compared with 94% at both 5 and 10 years for GS 2 to 6. The 5- and 10-year MFS for PSADT < 3 months were 70% and 61%, respectively, compared with 100% and 90% at 5 and 10 years, respectively, for PSADT >15 months.  Conclusions:   After BR post-RP, SRT results in low 5- and 10-year rates of metastasis after initial BR. Importantly, a substantial proportion of patients with high-risk disease (GS 8 to 10 or PSADT < 3 mo) are free from metastasis at these same time points.

Accurate positioning of the source is essential in delivering the desired dose to the target area while avoiding radiation injury to the surrounding tissue. In this paper, HDR BrachyView, a novel inbody dosimetric imaging system for real time monitoring and verification of the radioactive seed position in HDR prostate brachytherapy treatment is introduced. The current prototype consists of a 15 × 60 mm(2) silicon pixel detector with a multipinhole tungsten collimator placed 6.5 mm above the detector. Seven identical pinholes allow full imaging coverage of the entire treatment volume. The combined pinhole and pixel sensor arrangement is geometrically designed to be able to resolve the three-dimensional location of the source. The probe may be rotated to keep the whole prostate within the transverse plane. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the efficacy of the design through computer simulation, and to estimate the accuracy in resolving the source position (in detector plane and in 3D space) as part of the feasibility study for the BrachyView project.  Methods:   Monte Carlo simulations were performed using the GEANT4 radiation transport model, with a (192)Ir source placed in different locations within a prostate phantom. A geometrically accurate model of the detector and collimator were constructed. Simulations were conducted with a single pinhole to evaluate the pinhole design and the signal to background ratio obtained. Second, a pair of adjacent pinholes were simulated to evaluate the error in calculated source location.  Results:   Simulation results show that accurate determination of the true source position is easily obtainable within the typical one second source dwell time. The maximum error in the estimated projection position was found to be 0.95 mm in the imaging (detector) plane, resulting in a maximum source positioning estimation error of 1.48 mm.  Conclusions:   HDR BrachyView is a feasible design for real-time source tracking in HDR prostate brachytherapy. It is capable of resolving the source position within a subsecond dwell time. In combination with anatomical information obtained from transrectal ultrasound imaging, HDR BrachyView adds a significant quality assurance capability to HDR brachytherapy treatment systems.""","""['M Safavi-Naeini', 'Z Han', 'D Cutajar', 'S Guatelli', 'M Petasecca', 'M L F Lerch', 'D R Franklin', 'J Jakubek', 'S Pospisil', 'J Bucci', 'M Zaider', 'A B Rosenfeld']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Radiation dose enhancement at tissue-tungsten interfaces in HDR brachytherapy.', 'BrachyView, a novel in-body imaging system for HDR prostate brachytherapy: Experimental evaluation.', 'BrachyView: proof-of-principle of a novel in-body gamma camera for low dose-rate prostate brachytherapy.', 'The emerging role of high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy as monotherapy for prostate cancer.', 'AAPM and GEC-ESTRO guidelines for image-guided robotic brachytherapy: report of Task Group 192.', 'Preliminary Monte Carlo Investigation of Using Ir-192 as the Source for Real Time Imaging Purpose.', 'In vivo dosimetry: trends and prospects for brachytherapy.']"""

As a result, hypofractionation is expected to improve the therapeutic ratio in prostate radiation therapy. However, with the use of fewer, larger fractions, the accuracy of treatment dose delivery becomes more influenced by the physical uncertainties resulting from motion and radiobiological uncertainties in the α/β ratio of the prostate tumor. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of interfractional motion on treatment dose delivery within the likely range of the tumor α/β ratio.  Methods:   Serial CT images acquired at simulation and daily treatment for three prostate patients were studied retrospectively. A conventional 3D-conformal proton plan was created for each patient, delivering 25 fractions of 2 Gy to ITV1 (internal target volume, expanded from the prostate and clinically involved seminal vesicles) followed by 14 fractions to ITV2 (expanded from the prostate). The plans were renormalized for a series of hypofractionated protocols of between five and 28 fractions. The fractional doses were computed on daily CT and were mapped onto simulation CT using deformable registration. In each course, the doses from the fractions with the lowest D97% of the ITV2 were summed to approximate the lower limit (worst case) of target coverage. The uncertainty in dose and coverage was estimated as the deviation of the worst case from the nominal plan.  Results:   For treatments in 28 to five fractions, the uncertainty arising from interfractional motion ranged from ≈ 1% to 4% for V100% and ≈ 2% to 6% for D100% of the ITV2. The uncertainties in V95% and D95% were both minimal (<1%) for all protocols. For tumors with a low α/β of 1.0 Gy, the treatment in five fractions could deliver an additional 21.0 and 17.4 GyEQD2 to 95% and 100% of the ITV2, respectively, compared to that in 28 fractions. This advantage disappeared for tumors with α/β > 2.5 Gy, assuming the worst case for interfractional motion.  Conclusions:   In hypofractionated proton therapy for prostate cancer, the dosimetric uncertainties due to interfractional motion were minimal for the ITV2 coverage at 95% isodose level and the dose received by 95% of the ITV2. Although hypofractionation could yield an increase in equivalent dose to the target for tumors with low α/β, the gain was cancelled out by the uncertainty due to interfractional motion for tumors with α/β > 2.5 Gy.""","""['Yi Wang', 'Jason A Efstathiou', 'Hsiao-Ming Lu', 'Gregory C Sharp', 'Alexei Trofimov']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['MO-A-213AB-09: Hypofractionated Proton Therapy of the Prostate: The Impact of the Uncertainties in Dose Delivery and Alpha/Beta Ratio on Tumor Dose Escalation.', 'Evaluation of the dosimetric impact of interfractional anatomical variations on prostate proton therapy using daily in-room CT images.', 'Probabilistic dose distribution from interfractional motion in carbon ion radiation therapy for prostate cancer shows rectum sparing with moderate target coverage degradation.', 'Seminal vesicle inter- and intra-fraction motion during radiotherapy for prostate cancer: A review.', 'Hypofractionation in prostate cancer: radiobiological basis and clinical appliance.', 'Proton therapy- the modality of choice for future radiation therapy management of Prostate Cancer?', 'Proton beam therapy: clinical utility and current status in prostate cancer.', 'Investigating the Implications of a Variable RBE on Proton Dose Fractionation Across a Clinical Pencil Beam Scanned Spread-Out Bragg Peak.', 'The influence of patient positioning uncertainties in proton radiotherapy on proton range and dose distributions.']"""

Methods:   A beamlet-based inverse planning system was enhanced to combine the advantages of VMAT and IMRT into one comprehensive technique. In the hybrid strategy, baseline single-arc VMAT plans are optimized and then the current cost function gradients with respect to the beamlets are used to define a metric for predicting which beam angles would benefit from further intensity modulation. Beams with the highest metric values (called the gradient factor) are converted from VMAT apertures to IMRT fluence, and the optimization proceeds with the mixed variable set until convergence or until additional beams are selected for conversion. One phantom and two clinical cases were used to validate the gradient factor and characterize the FusionArc strategy. Comparisons were made between standard IMRT, single-arc VMAT, and FusionArc plans with one to five IMRT∕hybrid beams.  Results:   The gradient factor was found to be highly predictive of the VMAT angles that would benefit plan quality the most from beam modulation. Over the three cases studied, a FusionArc plan with three converted beams achieved superior dosimetric quality with reductions in final cost ranging from 26.4% to 48.1% compared to single-arc VMAT. Additionally, the three beam FusionArc plans required 22.4%-43.7% fewer MU∕Gy than a seven beam IMRT plan. While the FusionArc plans with five converted beams offer larger reductions in final cost--32.9%-55.2% compared to single-arc VMAT--the decrease in MU∕Gy compared to IMRT was noticeably smaller at 12.2%-18.5%, when compared to IMRT.  Conclusions:   A hybrid VMAT∕IMRT strategy was implemented to find a high quality compromise between gantry-angle and intensity-based degrees of freedom. This optimization method will allow patients to be simultaneously planned for dosimetric quality and delivery efficiency without switching between delivery techniques. Example phantom and clinical cases suggest that the conversion of only three VMAT segments to modulated beams may result in a good combination of quality and efficiency.""","""['Martha M Matuszak', 'Jennifer M Steers', 'Troy Long', 'Daniel L McShan', 'Benedick A Fraass', 'H Edwin Romeijn', 'Randall K Ten Haken']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['A comprehensive formulation for volumetric modulated arc therapy planning.', 'Feasibility of a unified approach to intensity-modulated radiation therapy and volume-modulated arc therapy optimization and delivery.', 'Quality of treatment plans and accuracy of in vivo portal dosimetry in hybrid intensity-modulated radiation therapy and volumetric modulated arc therapy for prostate cancer.', 'The use of Hybrid Techniques in Whole-Breast Radiotherapy: A Systematic Review.', 'Artificial intelligence applications in intensity modulated radiation treatment planning: an overview.', 'A fast optimization approach for treatment planning of volumetric modulated arc therapy.', 'Optimization of rotational arc station parameter optimized radiation therapy.', 'An IMRT/VMAT Technique for Nonsmall Cell Lung Cancer.', 'Optimization approaches to volumetric modulated arc therapy planning.', 'Use dose bricks concept to implement nasopharyngeal carcinoma treatment planning.']"""

IMRT optimization and/or multileaf collimator (MLC) sequencing schemes can be modified to generate more efficient treatment delivery, but the effect those modifications have on plan quality is often difficult to quantify. In this work, the authors present a method for quantitative assessment of overall plan quality degradation due to tradeoffs between delivery efficiency and treatment plan quality, illustrated using comparisons between plans developed allowing different numbers of intensity levels in IMRT optimization and/or MLC sequencing for static segmental MLC IMRT plans.  Methods:   A plan quality degradation method to evaluate delivery efficiency and plan quality tradeoffs was developed and used to assess planning for 14 prostate and 12 head and neck patients treated with static IMRT. Plan quality was evaluated using a physician's predetermined ""quality degradation"" factors for relevant clinical plan metrics associated with the plan optimization strategy. Delivery efficiency and plan quality were assessed for a range of optimization and sequencing limitations. The ""optimal"" (baseline) plan for each case was derived using a clinical cost function with an unlimited number of intensity levels. These plans were sequenced with a clinical MLC leaf sequencer which uses >100 segments, assuring delivered intensities to be within 1% of the optimized intensity pattern. Each patient's optimal plan was also sequenced limiting the number of intensity levels (20, 10, and 5), and then separately optimized with these same numbers of intensity levels. Delivery time was measured for all plans, and direct evaluation of the tradeoffs between delivery time and plan degradation was performed.  Results:   When considering tradeoffs, the optimal number of intensity levels depends on the treatment site and on the stage in the process at which the levels are limited. The cost of improved delivery efficiency, in terms of plan quality degradation, increased as the number of intensity levels in the sequencer or optimizer decreased. The degradation was more substantial for the head and neck cases relative to the prostate cases, particularly when fewer than 20 intensity levels were used. Plan quality degradation was less severe when the number of intensity levels was limited in the optimizer rather than the sequencer.  Conclusions:   Analysis of plan quality degradation allows for a quantitative assessment of the compromises in clinical plan quality as delivery efficiency is improved, in order to determine the optimal delivery settings. The technique is based on physician-determined quality degradation factors and can be extended to other clinical situations where investigation of various tradeoffs is warranted.""","""['Joel R Wilkie', 'Martha M Matuszak', 'Mary Feng', 'Jean M Moran', 'Benedick A Fraass']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Impact of leaf motion constraints on IMAT plan quality, deliver accuracy, and efficiency.', 'Treatment plan comparison between helical tomotherapy and MLC-based IMRT using radiobiological measures.', 'Efficiency of biological versus physical optimization for single-arc VMAT for prostate and head and neck cases.', 'Direct aperture optimization as a means of reducing the complexity of Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy plans.', 'Online adaptive planning methods for intensity-modulated radiotherapy.']"""

Methods:   Thirteen prostate patients underwent multiple US scans during treatment. A total of 376 US-scans and 817 matches were used to determine the intra- and interoperator variability. Additionally, eight other patients underwent daily prostate localization using both US and electronic portal imaging (EPI) with FMs resulting in 244 combined US-EPI scans. Scanning was performed with minimal probe pressure and a correction for the speed of sound aberration was performed. Uncertainties of both US and FM methods were assessed. User variability of the US method was assessed.  Results:   The overall US user variability is 2.6 mm. The mean differences between US and FM are: 2.5 ± 4.0 mm (LR), 0.6 ± 4.9 mm (SI), and -2.3 ± 3.6 mm (AP). The intramodality character of this US system mitigates potential errors due to transducer pressure and speed of sound aberrations.  Conclusions:   The overall accuracy of US (3.0 mm) is comparable to our FM workflow (2.2 mm). Since neither US nor FM can be considered a gold standard no conclusions can be drawn on the superiority of either method. Because US imaging captures the prostate itself instead of surrogates no invasive procedure is required. It requires more effort to standardize US imaging than FM detection. Since US imaging does not involve a radiation burden, US prostate imaging offers an alternative for FM EPI positioning.""","""['Skadi van der Meer', 'Esther Bloemen-van Gurp', 'Jolanda Hermans', 'Robert Voncken', 'Denys Heuvelmans', 'Carol Gubbels', 'Davide Fontanarosa', 'Peter Visser', 'Ludy Lutgens', 'Francis van Gils', 'Frank Verhaegen']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Evaluation of gold fiducial marker manual localisation for magnetic resonance-only prostate radiotherapy.', 'The potential failure risk of the cone-beam computed tomography-based planning target volume margin definition for prostate image-guided radiotherapy based on a prospective single-institutional hybrid analysis.', '3D ultrasound for prostate localization in radiation therapy: a comparison with implanted fiducial markers.', 'The impact of the three degrees-of-freedom fiducial marker-based setup compared to soft tissue-based setup in hypofractionated intensity-modulated radiotherapy for prostate cancer.', 'Fiducial marker guided prostate radiotherapy: a review.', '3D dosimetric validation of ultrasound-guided radiotherapy with a dynamically deformable abdominal phantom.', 'Analyses of the factors influencing the accuracy of three-dimensional ultrasound in comparison with cone-beam CT in image-guided radiotherapy for prostate cancer with or without pelvic lymph node irradiation.', 'Technical Note: Characterization of clinical linear accelerator triggering latency for motion management system development.', 'A patient-specific three-dimensional couplant pad for ultrasound image-guided radiation therapy: a feasibility study.', 'Acoustic Radiation Force Based Ultrasound Elasticity Imaging for Biomedical Applications.']"""

Methods:   All plans were generated fully automatically (i.e., no human trial-and-error interactions) using iCycle, the authors' in-house developed algorithm for multicriterial selection of beam angles and optimization of fluence profiles, allowing objective comparison of planning strategies. For 18 prostate cancer patients (eight with bilateral hip prostheses, ten with a right-sided unilateral prosthesis), two planning strategies were evaluated: (i) full exclusion of beams containing beamlets that would deliver dose to the target after passing a prosthesis (IMRT remove) and (ii) exclusion of those beamlets only (IMRT cut). Plans with optimized coplanar and noncoplanar beam arrangements were generated. Differences in PTV coverage and sparing of organs at risk (OARs) were quantified. The impact of beam number on plan quality was evaluated.  Results:   Especially for patients with bilateral hip prostheses, IMRT cut significantly improved rectum and bladder sparing compared to IMRT remove. For 9-beam coplanar plans, rectum V60 Gy reduced by 17.5% ± 15.0% (maximum 37.4%, p = 0.036) and rectum D mean by 9.4% ± 7.8% (maximum 19.8%, p = 0.036). Further improvements in OAR sparing were achievable by using noncoplanar beam setups, reducing rectum V 60Gy by another 4.6% ± 4.9% (p = 0.012) for noncoplanar 9-beam IMRT cut plans. Large reductions in rectum dose delivery were also observed when increasing the number of beam directions in the plans. For bilateral implants, the rectum V 60Gy was 37.3% ± 12.1% for coplanar 7-beam plans and reduced on average by 13.5% (maximum 30.1%, p = 0.012) for 15 directions.  Conclusions:   iCycle was able to automatically generate high quality plans for prostate cancer patients with prostheses.

HIP1 overexpression increases levels of the RTK epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and transforms fibroblasts. Here we report that HIP1 is tyrosine phosphorylated in the presence of EGFR and platelet-derived growth factor β receptor (PDGFβR) as well as the oncogenic derivatives EGFRvIII, HIP1/PDGFβR (H/P), and TEL/PDGFβR (T/P). We identified a four-tyrosine ""HIP1 phosphorylation motif"" (HPM) in the N-terminal region of HIP1 that is required for phosphorylation mediated by both EGFR and PDGFβR but not by the oncoproteins H/P and T/P. We also identified a tyrosine residue (Y152) within the HPM motif of HIP1 that inhibits HIP1 tyrosine phosphorylation. The HPM tyrosines are conserved in HIP1's only known mammalian relative, HIP1-related protein (HIP1r), and are also required for HIP1r phosphorylation. Tyrosine-to-phenylalanine point mutations in the HPM of HIP1 result in proapoptotic activity, indicating that an intact HPM may be necessary for HIP1's role in cellular survival.

Prostasomes are exosome-like vesicles that are secreted by the prostatic epithelium and have multiple proposed functions in normal reproduction and prostate cancer. In the current study, galectin-3 binding ligands in human prostasomes were identified and characterized with the goal to investigate galectin-3 function in prostasomes. Galectin-3 binding proteins were isolated by affinity column chromatography. Candidate ligands identified by MS/MS were PSA, prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP), zinc alpha-2-glycoprotein (ZAG), dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (CD26), aminopeptidase N (CD13), neprilysin, clusterin, antibacterial protein (FALL-39) and alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (ORM1). Biochemical methods were used to characterize the ability of galectin-3 to bind to selected ligands, and galectin-3 cleavage assays were utilized to investigate the protease(s) in prostasomes that cleaves galectin-3. CD26, CD13, PSA, PAP and ZAG immunoreactivity were detected in extracts of purified prostasomes. One-dimensional electroblot analysis of prostasomes demonstrated that CD26, PAP and CD13 immunoreactivity co-migrated with galectin-3-reactive protein bands. PSA and ZAG were found to be associated with the surface of prostasomes. Both intact and cleaved galectin-3 were detected in prostate and prostasome extracts. Cleavage and inhibition assays indicated that PSA in prostasomes proteolytically cleaves galectin-3.

We used saRNA as a molecular tool to examine NKX3-1's role as a tumor suppressor and tested in vitro and in vivo antitumor effects of NKX3-1 induction by saRNA.  Materials and methods:   NKX3-1 saRNA was transfected into human prostate cancer cells including LNCaP, CWR22R, PC-3, CWR22RV1, DuPro, LAPC4, and DU145. The transfected cells were used for analysis of gene expression by RT-PCR and immunoblotting, proliferation, apoptosis and cell cycle distribution. PC-3 xenograft models were established in immunocompromised mice and treated with NKX3-1 saRNA.  Results:   NKX3-1 saRNA induced NKX3-1 expression in different prostate cancer cell lines, resulting in inhibited cell proliferation and survival, cell cycle arrest and apoptotic cell death. These effects were partly mediated by NKX3-1's regulation of several downstream genes including the upregulation of p21 and p27, and the inhibition of VEGFC expression. Treatment of mouse xenograft prostate tumors with intratumoral delivery of NKX3-1 saRNA formulated in lipid nanoparticles significantly inhibited tumor growth and prolonged animal survival.  Conclusions:   By revealing several important target genes of NKX3-1, our findings corroborated NKX3-1's role as a tumor suppressor gene through direct regulation of the cell cycle and growth/survival pathways.

It is considered that epithelial stem cells are involved in the etiology and development of both diseases. To distinguish aberrant from normal cells, the knowledge about primary epithelial stem/progenitor cells (ES/P) is essential. The aim of this study was to examine the role of surface markers to distinguish between different subsets of prostate basal epithelium.  Methods:   The expression pattern of prostate tissue single cell suspensions was analyzed by flow cytometry using different markers. Sorted cell populations were examined for their clonogenic capacity and the resulted colonies were analyzed with flow cytometry, Western blot, and qPCR for stem cell, basal, and luminal epithelium markers. Additionally, the histological localization of the examined markers was determined using immunofluorescence.  Results:   Using the combination of CD49f, Trop-2, and surface CD24, basal cell subsets with distinct differentiation capacities were dissected (CD49f(+) Trop-2(+) CD24(-) and CD49f(+) Trop-2(+) CD24(+) ). Although cells from the two subsets gave rise to similar basal colonies, qPCR of primary tissue revealed that higher levels of basal marker expression were detected in the CD49f(+) Trop-2(+) CD24(-) subset. Immunofluorescence analysis showed a prominent expression of CD24 by luminal and basal cells.  Conclusions:   Subsets with distinct differentiation capacities within the basal epithelium (CD49f(+) Trop-2(+) CD24(-) and CD49f(+) Trop-2(+) CD24(+) ) can be distinguished in human prostate. CD24 is a marker expressed on the basal transit-amplifying cells (transition cells) and may play a role in the differentiation and migration of ES/P cells to the luminal layer.

This trial was a standard 3 + 3 dose escalation with 6 patients each in cohorts 4 and 5 to gather more immunologic data. Nineteen of 21 patients enrolled had locally recurrent prostate cancer after definitive radiation therapy, and 2 had no local therapy. All cohorts received initial subcutaneous vaccination with recombinant vaccinia (rV)-PSA-TRICOM and intraprostatic booster vaccinations with recombinant fowlpox (rF)-PSA-TRICOM. Cohorts 3-5 also received intraprostatic rF-GM-CSF. Cohort 5 received additional subcutaneous boosters with rF-PSA-TRICOM and rF-GM-CSF. Patients had pre- and post-treatment prostate biopsies, and analyses of peripheral and intraprostatic immune cells were performed. There were no dose-limiting toxicities, and the maximum tolerated dose was not reached. The most common grade 2 adverse events were fever (38%) and subcutaneous injection site reactions (33%); the single grade 3 toxicity was transient fever. Overall, 19 of 21 patients on trial had stable (10) or improved (9) PSA values. There was a marked increase in CD4+ (p = 0.0002) and CD8+ (p = 0.0002) tumor infiltrates in post- versus pre-treatment tumor biopsies. Four of 9 patients evaluated had peripheral immune responses to PSA or NGEP. Intraprostatic administration of PSA-TRICOM is safe and feasible and can generate a significant immunologic response.

The patients were screened with colonoscopy, mammography, thyroid and prostate ultrasonography. Malignancy was found in 34 (21.3%) patients. No significant difference was observed in the distribution of malignancy among sexes (20.3% in F vs. 22.2% in M). Thyroid cancer was the most frequent (n = 17, 10.6%) followed by the breast cancer (n = 4, 2.5%) and colorectal cancer (n = 3, 1.8%). Renal cell cancer in two patients, bladder cancer in two patients, periampullary tumor, rectal carcinoid tumor, malignant melanoma, prostate cancer, lung cancer, parotid mucoepidermoid carcinoma and malignant mesenchymal tumor in brain in one patient were detected. One patient had both thyroid and renal cell cancer. Age of patients at diagnosis of acromegaly was significantly higher in patients with cancer (45.8 ± 9.9 vs. 40.9 ± 11.3 years, p < 0.05). No significant difference was found in duration of the disease, initial GH levels and IGF-1% upper limit of normal values, the prevalence of diabetes, hypertension, coronary heart disease, hyperlipidemia and treatment modalities between the patients with/without cancer. In logistic regression analysis, older age at diagnosis was associated with malignancy risk. The risk of cancer in acromegaly especially the thyroid cancer risk seems to be more increased than known in the literature.

The aim was to evaluate the actual difference between early and late imaging.  Patients and methods:   Treatment planning computed tomography (CT) was performed shortly after injection of 10 ml hydrogel (CT1) and 1-2 weeks later (CT2) for 3 patients. The hydrogel was injected via the transperineal approach after dissecting the space between the prostate and rectum with a saline/lidocaine solution of at least 20-ml. Hydrogel volume and distances between the prostate and rectal wall were compared. Intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) plans up to a dose of 78 Gy were generated (rectum V70 < 20 %, rectum V50 < 50 %; with the rectum including hydrogel volume for planning).  Results:   A mean planning treatment volume of 104 cm(3) resulted for a prostate volume of 37 cm(3). Hydrogel volumes of 30 and 10 cm(3) were determined in CT1 and CT2, respectively. Distances between the prostate and rectal wall at the levels of the base, middle, and apex were 1.7 cm, 1.6 cm, 1.5 cm in CT1 and 1.3 cm, 1.2 cm, 0.8 cm in CT2, respectively, corresponding to a mean decrease of 24, 25, and 47 %.

Vγ9Vδ2 T cells are specifically activated by phosphorylated isoprenoid pathway metabolites called ""phosphoagonists."" Accordingly, pharmacologic inhibitors of the mevalonate pathway, such as aminobisphosphonates (NBP) that upregulate the intracellular production of phosphoagonists, increase antitumor Vγ9Vδ2 T cell responses. Immunotherapeutic protocols exploiting GMP-grade agonist molecules targeting human Vγ9Vδ2 T lymphocytes have yielded promising, yet limited, signs of antitumor efficacy and therefore need to be improved for next-generation immunotherapies. In this study, we used a model of s.c. human tumor xenografts in severely immunodeficient mice to assess the antitumor efficacy of systemic NBP treatments when combined with the adoptive transfer of human Vγ9Vδ2 T cells. We show that infusion of Vγ9Vδ2 T cells, 24 h after systemic NBP treatment, efficiently delays tumor growth in mice. Importantly, our results indicate efficient but transient in vivo NBP-induced sensitization of tumor cells to human Vγ9Vδ2-T cell recognition. Accordingly, repeated and combined administrations of both NBP and γδ T cells yielded improved antitumor responses in vivo.

Most primary care physicians, however, routinely order a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test with little or no discussion about whether they believe the potential benefits justify the risk of harm. We sought to assess whether educating primary care physicians and activating their patients to ask about prostate cancer screening had a synergistic effect on shared decision making, rates and types of discussions about prostate cancer screening, and the physician's final recommendations.  Methods:   Our study was a cluster randomized controlled trial among primary care physicians and their patients, comparing usual education (control), with physician education alone (MD-Ed), and with physician education and patient activation (MD-Ed+A). Participants included 120 physicians in 5 group practices, and 712 male patients aged 50 to 75 years. The interventions comprised a Web-based educational program for all intervention physicians and MD-Ed+A patients compared with usual education (brochures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention). The primary outcome measure was patients' reported postvisit shared decision making regarding prostate cancer screening; secondary measures included unannounced standardized patients' reported shared decision making and the physician's recommendation for prostate cancer screening.  Results:   Patients' ratings of shared decision making were moderate and did not differ between groups. MD-Ed+A patients reported that physicians had higher prostate cancer screening discussion rates (MD-Ed+A = 65%, MD-Ed = 41%, control=38%; P <.01). Standardized patients reported that physicians seeing MD-Ed+A patients were more neutral during prostate cancer screening recommendations (MD-Ed+A=50%, MD-Ed=33%, control=15%; P <.05). Of the male patients, 80% had had previous PSA tests.  Conclusions:   Although activating physicians and patients did not lead to significant changes in all aspects of physician attitudes and behaviors that we studied, interventions that involved physicians did have a large effect on their attitudes toward screening and in the discussions they had with patients, including their being more likely than control physicians to engage in prostate cancer screening discussions and more likely to be neutral in their final recommendations.""","""['Michael S Wilkes', 'Frank C Day', 'Malathi Srinivasan', 'Erin Griffin', 'Daniel J Tancredi', 'Julie A Rainwater', 'Richard L Kravitz', 'Douglas S Bell', 'Jerome R Hoffman']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Ann Fam Med""","""['Physician communication regarding prostate cancer screening: analysis of unannounced standardized patient visits.', 'National evidence on the use of shared decision making in prostate-specific antigen screening.', 'Do Men Receive Information Required for Shared Decision Making About PSA Testing?

We undertook a study to determine the prevalence of shared decision making in both PSA screening and nonscreening, as well as patient characteristics associated with shared decision making.  Methods:   A nationally representative sample of 3,427 men aged 50 to 74 years participating in the 2010 National Health Interview Survey responded to questions on the extent of shared decision making (past physician-patient discussion of advantages, disadvantages, and scientific uncertainty associated with PSA screening), PSA screening intensity (tests in past 5 years), and sociodemographic and health-related characteristics.  Results:   Nearly two-thirds (64.3%) of men reported no past physician-patient discussion of advantages, disadvantages, or scientific uncertainty (no shared decision making); 27.8% reported discussion of 1 to 2 elements only (partial shared decision making); 8.0% reported discussion of all 3 elements (full shared decision making). Nearly one-half (44.2%) reported no PSA screening, 27.8% reported low-intensity (less-than-annual) screening, and 25.1% reported high-intensity (nearly annual) screening. Absence of shared decision making was more prevalent in men who were not screened; 88% (95% CI, 86.2%-90.1%) of nonscreened men reported no shared decision making compared with 39% (95% CI, 35.0%-43.3%) of men undergoing high-intensity screening. Extent of shared decision making was associated with black race, Hispanic ethnicity, higher education, health insurance, and physician recommendation. Screening intensity was associated with older age, higher education, usual source of medical care, and physician recommendation, as well as with partial vs no or full shared decision making.  Conclusions:   Most US men report little shared decision making in PSA screening, and the lack of shared decision making is more prevalent in nonscreened than in screened men. Screening intensity is greatest with partial shared decision making, and different elements of shared decision making are associated with distinct patient characteristics. Shared decision making needs to be improved in decisions for and against PSA screening.""","""['Paul K J Han', 'Sarah Kobrin', 'Nancy Breen', 'Djenaba A Joseph', 'Jun Li', 'Dominick L Frosch', 'Carrie N Klabunde']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Ann Fam Med""","""['Pairing physician education with patient activation to improve shared decisions in prostate cancer screening: a cluster randomized controlled trial.', 'Do Men Receive Information Required for Shared Decision Making About PSA Testing?

The current treatment planning system (TPS) for IMPT disregards deliverable MU constraints in the SIO routine. It performs a post-processing procedure on an optimized plan to enforce deliverable MU values that are required by the spot scanning proton delivery system. This procedure can create a significant dose distribution deviation between the optimized and post-processed deliverable plans, especially when small spot spacings are used. In this study, we introduce a two-stage linear programming approach to optimize spot intensities and constrain deliverable MU values simultaneously, i.e., a deliverable SIO (DSIO) model. Thus, the post-processing procedure is eliminated and the associated optimized plan deterioration can be avoided. Four prostate cancer cases at our institution were selected for study and two parallel opposed beam angles were planned for all cases. A quadratic programming based model without MU constraints, i.e., a conventional SIO (CSIO) model, was also implemented to emulate commercial TPS. Plans optimized by both the DSIO and CSIO models were evaluated for five different settings of spot spacing from 3 to 7 mm. For all spot spacings, the DSIO-optimized plans yielded better uniformity for the target dose coverage and critical structure sparing than did the CSIO-optimized plans. With reduced spot spacings, more significant improvements in target dose uniformity and critical structure sparing were observed in the DSIO than in the CSIO-optimized plans. Additionally, better sparing of the rectum and bladder was achieved when reduced spacings were used for the DSIO-optimized plans. The proposed DSIO approach ensures the deliverability of optimized IMPT plans that take into account MU constraints. This eliminates the post-processing procedure required by the TPS as well as the resultant deteriorating effect on ultimate dose distributions. This approach therefore allows IMPT plans to adopt all possible spot spacings optimally. Moreover, dosimetric benefits can be achieved using smaller spot spacings.""","""['Wenhua Cao', 'Gino Lim', 'Xiaoqiang Li', 'Yupeng Li', 'X Ronald Zhu', 'Xiaodong Zhang']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Intensity modulated proton therapy treatment planning using single-field optimization: the impact of monitor unit constraints on plan quality.', 'Integrated beam orientation and scanning-spot optimization in intensity-modulated proton therapy for brain and unilateral head and neck tumors.', 'TH-A-BRCD-01: Electron Radiotherapy: Past, Present, and Future.', 'Use of single-energy proton pencil beam scanning Bragg peak for intensity-modulated proton therapy FLASH treatment planning in liver-hypofractionated radiation therapy.', 'Uncertainty incorporated beam angle optimization for IMPT treatment planning.', 'A treatment plan optimization method with direct minimization of number of energy jumps for proton arc therapy.', 'An iterative convex relaxation method for proton LET optimization.', 'Delivery of intensity-modulated electron therapy by mechanical scanning: An algorithm study.', 'A Review of Proton Therapy - Current Status and Future Directions.', 'TVL1-IMPT: Optimization of Peak-to-Valley Dose Ratio Via Joint Total-Variation and L1 Dose Regularization for Spatially Fractionated Pencil-Beam-Scanning Proton Therapy.']"""

Methods:   ARSB immunostaining was performed on two tissue microarrays (TMAs) and analyzed by digital image analysis, generating ARSB H-scores for prevalence and intensity of epithelial, stromal and combined epithelial and stromal immunostaining. Also, paired malignant and normal prostate tissues were analyzed for ARSB activity, C4S, total sulfated glycosaminoglycans and versican content. The quantities of C4S and of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) that co-immunoprecipitated with versican were determined in the normal and malignant paired prostate tissues.  Results:   Forty-four cases of prostate cancer were paired by age (± 5 years), race, Gleason score (in order) and pathological TNM (tumor, node, metastasis) score. The pairs differed by recurrence vs non-recurrence of elevated PSA at ≥ 4 years. When TMA cores were analyzed for ARSB H-score, 18 of the 22 pairs had lower ARSB H-scores in the recurrent member of the pair, whereas higher initial PSA values were associated with recurrence in only 65% of the paired cases. In a second TMA, Gleason scores 6 and 7 were associated with higher ARSB H-scores than Gleason scores 8 and 9 for stroma, epithelium and stroma and epithelium combined (P=0.052, P=0.015, P<0.0001, respectively) and were inversely correlated (r=-0.98, -0.97 and -0.99, respectively). In other paired normal and malignant prostate tissues, ARSB activity was significantly higher in the normal tissues, and C4S and versican values were lower (P<0.0001). C4S that co-immunoprecipitated with versican was greater in the malignant than in the normal tissue, whereas total EGFR that co-immunoprecipitated with versican was reduced.

The differences in the systematic and random errors between the modalities were within 0.2 mm in all directions. The LoA analysis revealed a 95% agreement limit of the modalities of 2 to 3.5 mm in any given translational direction. Deming regression analysis demonstrated that constant biases existed in the shifts computed by the modalities in the superior-inferior (SI) direction, but no significant proportional biases were identified in any direction.

This study consists of 20 patients who underwent ultrasound-based real-time HDR brachytherapy of the prostate using the treatment planning system called Oncentra Prostate (SWIFT version 3.0). The treatment plans for all patients were optimized using inverse dose-volume histogram-based optimization followed by graphical optimization (GRO) in real time. The GRO is manual manipulation of isodose lines slice by slice. The quality of the plan heavily depends on planner expertise and experience. The data for all patients were retrieved later, and treatment plans were created and optimized using HIPO algorithm with the same set of dose constraints, number of catheters, and set of contours as in the real-time optimization algorithm. The HIPO algorithm is a hybrid because it combines both stochastic and deterministic algorithms. The stochastic algorithm, called simulated annealing, searches the optimal catheter distributions for a given set of dose objectives. The deterministic algorithm, called dose-volume histogram-based optimization (DVHO), optimizes three-dimensional dose distribution quickly by moving straight downhill once it is in the advantageous region of the search space given by the stochastic algorithm. The PTV receiving 100% of the prescription dose (V100) was 97.56% and 95.38% with GRO and HIPO, respectively. The mean dose (D(mean)) and minimum dose to 10% volume (D10) for the urethra, rectum, and bladder were all statistically lower with HIPO compared to GRO using the student pair t-test at 5% significance level. HIPO can provide treatment plans with comparable target coverage to that of GRO with a reduction in dose to the critical structures.""","""['Shyam Pokharel', 'Suresh Rana', 'Joseph Blikenstaff', 'Amir Sadeghi', 'Bradley Prestidge']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Appl Clin Med Phys""","""['Comparison of dose and catheter optimization algorithms in prostate high-dose-rate brachytherapy.', 'A comparison of inverse optimization algorithms for HDR/PDR prostate brachytherapy treatment planning.', 'Investigating the role of constrained CVT and CVT in HIPO inverse planning for HDR brachytherapy of prostate cancer.', 'Use of three-dimensional radiation therapy planning tools and intraoperative ultrasound to evaluate high dose rate prostate brachytherapy implants.', 'Paradigm Shift in Radiation Treatment Planning Over Multiple Treatment Modalities.', 'Comparative analysis of dosimetric and radiobiological models of IPSA and HIPO algorithms in combined intra-cavitary/interstitial brachytherapy for cervical cancer.', 'Commissioning of GPU-based multi-criteria optimizer combined with plan navigation tools for high-dose-rate brachytherapy.', 'Assessment of efficacy in automated plan generation for Varian Ethos intelligent optimization engine.', 'Comparison of two inverse planning algorithms for cervical cancer brachytherapy.', 'Does inverse planning improve plan quality in interstitial high-dose-rate breast brachytherapy?']"""

IMRT has the ability to deliver highly conformal dose to the target while lowering irradiation of critical organs around the prostate. Volumetric-modulated arc therapy is able to reduce treatment time, but its impact on organ sparing is still controversial when compared to static gantry IMRT. We compared the two techniques in simultaneous integrated boost plans. Ten patients with locally advanced prostate cancer were included. The planning target volume (PTV) 1 was defined as the pelvic lymph nodes, the prostate, and the seminal vesicles plus setup margins. The PTV2 consisted of the prostate with setup margins. The prescribed doses to PTV1 and PTV2 were 54 Gy in 37 fractions and 74 Gy in 37 fractions, respectively. We compared simultaneous integrated boost plans by means of either a seven coplanar static split fields IMRT, or a one-arc (RA1) and a two-arc (RA2) RapidArc planning. All three techniques allowed acceptable homogeneity and PTV coverage. Static IMRT enabled a better homogeneity for PTV2 than RapidArc techniques. Sliding window IMRT and VMAT permitted to maintain doses to OAR within acceptable levels with a low risk of side effects for each organ. VMAT plans resulted in a clinically and statistically significant reduction in doses to bladder (mean dose IMRT: 50.1 ± 4.6Gy vs. mean dose RA2: 47.1 ± 3.9 Gy, p = 0.037), rectum (mean dose IMRT: 44± 4.5 vs. mean dose RA2: 41.6 ± 5.5 Gy, p = 0.006), and small bowel (V30 IMRT: 76.47 ± 14.91% vs. V30 RA2: 47.49 ± 16.91%, p = 0.002).

Forty-four patients were enrolled and randomized to receive a single dose of ZA given 1 week before beginning ADT (arm 1), a single dose of ZA given 6 months after beginning ADT (arm 2), or monthly administration of ZA starting 6 months after beginning ADT, for a total of 6 doses (arm 3).

On multivariate analysis a PSADT <6 months predicted BF (HR:2.0, [95%CI: 1.4-2.9], p=0.0001), DM (HR:2.0, [95%CI: 1.2-3.4], p=0.01), and PCSM (HR:2.6, [95%CI: 1.1-5.9], p=0.02).  Conclusions:   A pre-SRT PSADT <6 months was a strong predictor of outcomes in our data set, including PCSM. The most common nomogram for SRT uses a 10-month PSADT threshold for assigning points used to assess BF following SRT. If validated, our findings suggest that a PSADT threshold of <6 months should be considered for stratification of patients in future clinical trials in this setting.""","""['William C Jackson', 'Skyler B Johnson', 'Darren Li', 'Corey Foster', 'Benjamin Foster', 'Yeohan Song', 'Matthew Schipper', 'Mark Shilkrut', 'Howard M Sandler', 'Todd M Morgan', 'Ganesh S Palapattu', 'Daniel A Hamstra', 'Felix Y Feng']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Radiat Oncol""","""['Less advanced disease at initiation of salvage androgen deprivation therapy is associated with decreased mortality following biochemical failure post-salvage radiation therapy.', 'Larger maximum tumor diameter at radical prostatectomy is associated with increased biochemical failure, metastasis, and death from prostate cancer after salvage radiation for prostate cancer.', 'The interval to biochemical failure is prognostic for metastasis, prostate cancer-specific mortality, and overall mortality after salvage radiation therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Use of androgen deprivation and salvage radiation therapy for patients with prostate cancer and biochemical recurrence after prostatectomy.', 'What is the possible role of PSA doubling time (PSADT) and PSA velocity (PSAV) in the decision-making process to initiate salvage radiotherapy following radical prostatectomy in patients with prostate cancer?', ""A critical review on oligometastatic disease: a radiation oncologist's perspective."", 'Optimal Definition of Biochemical Recurrence in Patients Who Receive Salvage Radiotherapy Following Radical Prostatectomy for Prostate Cancer.', 'Salvage therapy for prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy.', 'Tissue- and Liquid-Based Biomarkers in Prostate Cancer Precision Medicine.', 'Metastatic Spread in Prostate Cancer Patients Influencing Radiotherapy Response.']"""

Patients and methods:   Between August 2006 and August 2011, 200 patients with prostate cancer underwent RARP and were enrolled in this study. We prospectively collected the demographic data and analyzed the pathologic and functional outcomes. The operative outcomes analyzed were total operative time, estimated blood loss (EBL), positive surgical margin (PSM), incontinence, and perioperative complications. We also evaluated the relationship between the surgeon's experience and operative variables.  Results:   The sloping learning curve for this surgeon showed that total operative time was strongly correlated with the accumulation of experience for the initial 25 cases (|rs|=0.71, P<0.001). The average EBL was not strongly correlated with additional experience (|rs|<0.7). The PSM rate for the first 50 cases was significantly higher than that of the next 150 cases (34.8% vs 19.4%, P=0.035). The complication rate among the first 50 patients was significantly higher than that among the remaining 150 patients (32% vs 12.7%, P=0.002). The incontinence rate at 12 months was significantly higher for the first 100 cases compared with that for the next 100 cases (9.0% vs 1.0%, P=0.009). For the surgeon to optimize total operative time, PSM rate, complication rate, and incontinence rate, slope learning curves of 25, 50, 50, and 100 cases were needed.  Conclusions:   The functional and pathologic results of this minimally invasive procedure seemed to be promising. Distinct learning curves were observed with respect to operative time, PSM, complication rate, and incontinence rate.

Five common subtypes of depression were defined from the wider literature, and patients' depressive symptomatology was used to determine their scores on each of the five depression subtypes. Nearly half of the patients had scores which could be classified as clinically significant for at least one of the five depression subtypes, with some patients showing clinically significant scores for multiple depression subtypes. Different depression subtypes were predicted by different prostate-cancer-related stressors.

Results:   Age-specific prevalence of PSA testing was similar in 2005 and 2010. In 2010, 44.1% of men aged ≥70 years had PSA testing. Only 27.2% (95% confidence interval, 22.2-32.9) of them reported having discussions about both advantages and disadvantages of testing. Multiple regression analyses showed that PSA-based screening was positively associated with discussions of advantages only (P < .001) and with discussions of both advantages and disadvantages (P < .001) compared with no discussion. Discussion of scientific uncertainties was not associated with PSA testing.  Conclusions:   Efforts are needed to increase physicians' awareness of and adherence to PSA-based screening recommendations.

Certain pesticides have been shown to deregulate vitamin D's anticarcinogenic properties. We hypothesize that certain pesticides may be linked to prostate cancer via an interaction with vitamin D genetic variants.  Methods:   We evaluated interactions between 41 pesticides and 152 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in nine vitamin D pathway genes among 776 prostate cancer cases and 1,444 male controls in a nested case-control study of Caucasian pesticide applicators within the Agricultural Health Study. We assessed Pinteraction values using likelihood ratio tests from unconditional logistic regression and a false discovery rate (FDR) to account for multiple comparisons.  Results:   Five significant interactions (P < 0.01) displayed a monotonic increase in prostate cancer risk with individual pesticide use in one genotype and no association in the other. These interactions involved parathion and terbufos use and three vitamin D genes (VDR, RXRB, and GC). The exposure-response pattern among participants with increasing parathion use with the homozygous CC genotype for GC rs7041 compared with unexposed participants was noteworthy [low vs. no exposure: OR, 2.58, 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.07-6.25; high vs. no exposure: OR, 3.09, 95% CI, 1.10-8.68; Pinteraction = 3.8 × 10(-3)].  Conclusions:   In this study, genetic variations in vitamin D pathway genes, particularly GC rs7041, an SNP previously linked to lower circulating vitamin D levels, modified pesticide associations with prostate cancer risk.

However, to date, few causative mutations have been identified.  Methods:   To identify rare mutations for prostate cancer, we conducted whole-exome sequencing (WES) in multiple kindreds (n = 91) from 19 hereditary prostate cancer (HPC) families characterized by aggressive or early-onset phenotypes. Candidate variants (n = 130) identified through family- and bioinformatics-based filtering of WES data were then genotyped in an independent set of 270 HPC families (n = 819 prostate cancer cases; n = 496 unaffected relatives) for replication. Two variants with supportive evidence were subsequently genotyped in a population-based case-control study (n = 1,155 incident prostate cancer cases; n = 1,060 age-matched controls) for further confirmation. All participants were men of European ancestry.  Results:   The strongest evidence was for two germline missense variants in the butyrophilin-like 2 (BTNL2) gene (rs41441651, p.Asp336Asn and rs28362675, p.Gly454Cys) that segregated with affection status in two of the WES families. In the independent set of 270 HPC families, 1.5% (rs41441651; P = 0.0032) and 1.2% (rs28362675; P = 0.0070) of affected men, but no unaffected men, carried a variant.

Methods:   Among consecutive men who received robot-assisted or open retropubic RP between 2004 and 2011, 872 (74.7 %) and 296 (25.3 %) were randomly assigned to subcohorts for the development of nomograms and for the split-sample external validation. The final multivariate model was selected based on the stepwise procedure, and the regression coefficient-based nomograms were developed based on final models.  Results:   Age at surgery, membranous urethral length (MUL), and robot-assisted RP were significant for RC at 1, 3, and 12 months. Saving the neurovascular bundle (NVB) and prostate volume were significant only for RC at 12 months. Odds ratios for age and MUL were constant over time, whereas the odds ratio for robot-assisted surgery decreased over time. Each developed nomogram was reasonably well fitted to the ideal line of the calibration plot. The split-sample external validation of nomograms indicated 63, 65, 71 % accuracy for each RC time point.

Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), a heterodimer consisting of HIF-1α and HIF-1β (also known as aromatic hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT)) subunits, is an important regulator of angiogenesis in prostate cancer (PC) through the enhancement of VEGF-A expression. In this study, we first confirmed the ability of LPA to induce VEGF-A expression in PC-3 cells and then validated that LPA-induced VEGF-A expression was regulated by HIF-1α and ARNT through phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activation. Aromatic hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), a receptor for dioxin-like compounds, functions as a transcription factor through dimerization with ARNT and was found to inhibit prostate carcinogenesis and vanadate-induced VEGF-A production. Since ARNT is a common dimerization partner of AHR and HIF-1α, we hypothesized that AHR might suppress LPA-induced VEGF-A expression in PC-3 cells by competing with HIF-1α for ARNT. Here we demonstrated that overexpression and ligand activation of AHR inhibited HIF-1-mediated VEGF-A induction by LPA treatment of PC-3 cells. In conclusion, our results suggested that AHR activation may inhibit LPA-induced VEGF-A expression in PC-3 cells by attenuating HIF-1α signaling, and subsequently, suppressing angiogenesis and metastasis of PC.

We assessed patient outcomes for combined vs single device implantation at a single institution.  Materials and methods:   We retrospectively reviewed the records of all patients who underwent inflatable penile prosthesis and artificial urinary sphincter insertion at our hospital from January 2000 to December 2011. A total of 55 combined procedures were performed compared to the single insertion of 336 inflatable penile prostheses and 279 artificial urinary sphincters.  Results:   The surgical approach consisted of penoscrotal incisions for inflatable penile prostheses and transperineal incisions for artificial urinary sphincter cuff placement with a secondary lower abdominal incision for reservoir placement. Men treated with combined implantation had greater mean age and were at greater risk for prostate cancer diagnosis and treatment, and at lesser risk for Peyronie disease than men who received an inflatable penile prosthesis alone (each p<0.05). Although operative time was significantly longer for the combined procedure than for the inflatable penile prosthesis alone and the AUS alone (mean 218.1 vs 145.9 and 114.7 minutes, respectively, p<0.0001), the rate of device infection, erosion or malfunction was not increased irrespective of combined or staged procedures (p>0.05).  Conclusions:   Combined inflatable penile prosthesis-artificial urinary sphincter implantation and staged prosthesis implantation are feasible without an increased risk of adverse outcomes compared to implantation of a single prosthesis. Patients with concomitant erectile dysfunction and stress urinary incontinence should be counseled about the possible advantages of this surgical option, which include a single anesthesia event and faster resumption of sexual activity and urinary control.""","""['Robert L Segal', 'Mercelo R Cabrini', 'Elaine D Harris', 'Jacek L Mostwin', 'Trinity J Bivalacqua', 'Arthur L Burnett']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['A Contemporary Analysis of Dual Inflatable Penile Prosthesis and Artificial Urinary Sphincter Outcomes.', 'Patient satisfaction after dual implantation of inflatable penile and artificial urinary sphincter prostheses.', 'Management of end-stage erectile dysfunction and stress urinary incontinence after radical prostatectomy by simultaneous dual implantation using a single trans-scrotal incision: surgical technique and outcomes.', 'Experience with the penile prosthesis and artificial urinary sphincter.', 'Artificial urinary sphincter surgery in the special populations: neurological, revision, concurrent penile prosthesis and female stress urinary incontinence groups.', 'Simultaneous implant of inflatable penile prosthesis and artificial urinary sphincter: a single high-volume center experience.', 'Climacturia: what treatment options do we offer to those with and without concomitant erectile dysfunction?', 'Editorial Comment: A Contemporary Analysis of Dual Inflatable Penile Prosthesis and Artificial Urinary Sphincter Outcomes.', 'Comparing Risk Factors for Adverse Outcomes in Virgin Inflatable Penile Prosthesis Implantations and Revisions: A Retrospective Cohort Study.', 'Concurrent Penile Prosthesis and Artificial Urinary Sphincter versus Penile Prosthesis and Male Sling: A National Multi-Institutional Analysis of National Surgical Quality Improvement Program Database Comparing Postoperative Morbidity.']"""

Methods:   Thirty-seven patients underwent placement of an ATUS from 2008 to 2010. Patients with and without a history of preoperative XRT were retrospectively compared in regard to their demographical, preoperative, perioperative, and postoperative details.  Results:   The median follow-up was 17.3 months. Preoperative pad usage was significantly higher in the XRT patient group (P = .03). Overall, 19 patients (51.4%) used no pads, 10 patients (27.0%) were improved, 4 patients (10.8%) had no change, and 4 patients (10.8%) experienced worsening incontinence after the surgery. In patients with and without a history of XRT, 0 (0%) and 19 (63.3%) used no pads, 2 (28.6%) and 8 (26.7%) were improved, 2 (28.6%) and 2 (6.7%) showed no change, and 3 (42.9%) and 1 (3.3%) were worse, respectively.

Methods:   The Columbia University Urologic Oncology database identified patients that underwent CS after resection. Patient demographics, surgical details, prostate volume, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, biopsy results, major complications, and BCR were recorded.  Results:   Prior resection for benign prostatic hyperplasia was identified in 32 patients who underwent CS. Median age was 70.7 years (range 54.9-83.1 years). Median prostate volume before and after resection was 40 (range 30-90) and 20 cm(3) (range 9-54), respectively. Median time from resection to CS was 50.4 months (range 0-178.1 months).

Radiotherapy is a commonly used modality for palliation of symptoms, and we investigated whether we could predict differences in overall survival after the first course of palliative radiotherapy using routinely available data.  Materials and methods:   We examined variations in survival in 1226 patients after their first course of palliative radiotherapy in relation to cancer type, site treated, age, gender and socioeconomic status, and developed a multivariate model based on these.  Results:   The median overall survival after the first course of palliative radiotherapy was 5.2 months. Large differences in survival were seen, depending on the primary tumour and the site treated. Survival was much better in those with breast (median overall survival 11.4 months) or prostate cancer (8.4 months, hazard ratio = 1.3) than in those with oesophageal/gastro-oesophageal junctional tumours (4.6 months, hazard ratio = 2.3) or lung (3.9 months, hazard ratio = 2.5). The treated site was an important prognostic factor (primary tumour versus bone metastases, hazard ratio = 1.3; versus brain metastases, hazard ratio = 2.1).  Conclusions:   The median overall survival after a first course of palliative radiotherapy was less than 6 months. Simple data, provided as part of routine radiotherapy practice, clearly discriminate between patients with very different prognoses.

Temsirolimus blocks mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)/target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1), a key signaling node in this pathway; its activity in men with advanced castration-resistant metastatic prostate cancer (mCRPC) is unknown.  Methods:   We conducted a single-arm trial of weekly intravenous temsirolimus administration in men with chemorefractory mCRPC who had ≥ 5 circulating tumor cells (CTCs) at baseline. The primary end point was the change in CTCs at 8 weeks; secondary end points were composite progression-free survival (PFS) (excluding prostate-specific antigen [PSA]), PSA and radiographic response rates, safety, and survival. At PSA/CTC progression, an anti-androgen could be added while continuing temsirolimus.  Results:   Eleven patients were accrued out of a planned 20; the trial was stopped prematurely because of lack of efficacy/feasibility. Median age was 61 years, with 55% African-Americans and 36% Caucasian patients. Median baseline PSA level was 390 ng/dL, median baseline number of CTCs was 14 cells; 50% of patients had pain, and 63% had undergone ≥ 2 previous chemotherapy regimens. Median CTC decline was 48% and 3 patients experienced decline in CTCs to < 5. However, 73% of men had a persistently unfavorable number of CTCs (≥ 5) and only 1 patient had a ≥ 30% PSA decline.

However the search for SNPs from this data is generally performed on a study-by-study case without any specific hypothesis of the location for SNPs that are predictive for the phenotype. We have designed a method whereby very large SNP lists (several gigabytes in size), combining several genotyping studies at once, can be sorted and traced back to their ultimate consequence in protein structure. Given a working hypothesis, researchers are able to easily search whole genome genotyping data for SNPs that link genetic locations to phenotypes. This allows a targeted search for correlations between phenotypes and potentially relevant systems, rather than utilizing statistical methods only. HyDn-SNP-S returns results that are less data dense, allowing more thorough analysis, including haplotype analysis. We have applied our method to correlate DNA polymerases to cancer phenotypes using four of the available cancer databases in dbGaP. Logistic regression and derived haplotype analysis indicates that ~80SNPs, previously overlooked, are statistically significant. Derived haplotypes from this work link POLL to breast cancer and POLG to prostate cancer with an increase in incidence of 3.01- and 9.6-fold, respectively. Molecular dynamics simulations on wild-type and one of the SNP mutants from the haplotype of POLL provide insights at the atomic level on the functional impact of this cancer related SNP.

We computed incidence rates of NPCs per 10,000 person years (PY) and associated 95% confidence intervals (CI), and used Cox proportional hazards regression to compute hazard ratios (HRs) and 95%CI, adjusting for comorbidities. In order to obviate any impact of shorter survival among prostate cancer patients, we censored comparator patients when the matched prostate cancer patient died or was censored.  Results:   Follow-up spanned 113,487PY and 462,982PY in the PC and comparison cohorts, respectively. 65% of the cohorts were aged >70 years at diagnosis. Among PC patients, 51% had distant/unspecified stage, and 63% had surgery as primary treatment. The PC cohort had lower incidence of NPCs than their comparators. The adjusted HR of NPC among men with PC versus the comparators was 0.84 (95%CI=0.80, 0.88). Lowest HRs were among older men, those with distant stage, and were particularly evident for cancers of the brain, liver, pancreas, respiratory, upper gastrointestinal, and urinary systems.  Conclusions:   We find no evidence of an increased risk of NPCs among men with PC. The deficit of NPCs among men with PC may be a true effect but is more likely due to lower levels of risk factors (e.g., smoking) in PC patients versus comparators, clinical consideration of cancers at new organs as metastases rather than new primaries, or under-recording/under-reporting of NPCs among PC patients.""","""['D P Cronin-Fenton', 'S Antonsen', 'K Cetin', 'A Daniels', 'M Borre', 'J Acquavella', 'T L Lash']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Cancer Epidemiol""","""['Prostate cancer in Denmark 1978-2009--trends in incidence and mortality.', 'Association of clinical benign prostate hyperplasia with prostate cancer incidence and mortality revisited: a nationwide cohort study of 3,009,258 men.', 'Prostate cancer mortality in the Finnish randomized screening trial.', 'Is prostate cancer incidence worldwide linked to artificial light at night exposures?

Herein, we show that ITGA7 binds to tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 3 (TIMP3) in prostate cancer cells. The ITGA7-TIMP3 binding led to a decreased protein level of tumor necrosis factor α, cytoplasmic translocation of NF-κB, and down-regulation of cyclin D1. These changes led to an accumulation of cells in G0/G1 and a dramatic suppression of cell growth. Knocking down TIMP3 or ITGA7/TIMP3 binding interference largely abrogated the signaling changes induced by ITGA7, whereas a mutant ITGA7 lacking TIMP3 binding activity had no tumor-suppressor activity. Interestingly, knocking down ITGA7 ligand laminin β1 enhanced ITGA7-TIMP3 signaling and the downstream tumor-suppressor activity, suggesting the existence of a counterbalancing role between extracellular matrix and integrin signaling. As a result, this report demonstrates a novel and critical signaling mechanism of ITGA7, through the TIMP3/NF-κB/cyclin D1 pathway.""","""['Lang-Zhu Tan', 'Yang Song', 'Joel Nelson', 'Yan P Yu', 'Jian-Hua Luo']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Am J Pathol""","""['Integrin alpha 7 interacts with high temperature requirement A2 (HtrA2) to induce prostate cancer cell death.', 'Epigenetic down-regulation of integrin α7 increases migratory potential and confers poor prognosis in malignant pleural mesothelioma.', 'Interaction of integrin-linked kinase and miniature chromosome maintenance 7-mediating integrin {alpha}7 induced cell growth suppression.', 'Circular RNA circITGA7 inhibits colorectal cancer growth and metastasis by modulating the Ras pathway and upregulating transcription of its host gene ITGA7.', 'Integrin α7 high expression correlates with deteriorative tumor features and worse overall survival, and its knockdown inhibits cell proliferation and invasion but increases apoptosis in breast cancer.', 'Integrated Analysis of mRNAs and Long Non-Coding RNAs Expression of Oviduct That Provides Novel Insights into the Prolificacy Mechanism of Goat (Capra hircus).', 'Integrins and Epithelial-Mesenchymal Cooperation in the Tumor Microenvironment of Muscle-Invasive Lethal Cancers.', ""Decrease in ITGA7 Levels Is Associated with an Increase in α-Synuclein Levels in an MPTP-Induced Parkinson's Disease Mouse Model and SH-SY5Y Cells."", 'Integrin α7 knockdown suppresses cell proliferation, migration, invasion and EMT in hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'MAb NJ001 inhibits lung adenocarcinoma invasiveness by directly regulating TIMP-3 promoter activity via FOXP1 binding sites.']"""

Materials and methods:   Fifty-six male patients underwent CT examination with spectral imaging during arterial phase (AP), venous phase (VP), and parenchymal phase (PP) of enhancement. Iodine concentrations of lesions were measured and normalized to that of the obturator internus muscle. Lesion CT values at 75 keV (corresponding to the energy of polychromatic images at 120 kVp) were measured and also normalized; their differences between AP and VP, VP and PP, and PP and AP were also obtained. The two-sample t-test was performed for comparisons. A receiver operating characteristic curve was generated to establish the threshold for normalized iodine concentration (NIC).  Results:   Fifty-two peripheral lesions were found, which were confirmed by biopsy as 28 cases of PCa and 24 BPHs. The NICs of prostate cancers significantly differed from those of the BPHs: 2.38 ± 1.72 compared with 1.21 ± 0.72 in AP, respectively, and 2.67 ± 0.61 compared with 2.27 ± 0.77 in VP. Receiver operating characteristic analysis indicated that an NIC of 1.24 in the AP provided a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 71% for differentiating PCa from BPH.

Methods:   This was a multi-institution, retrospective study of a random sample of patients undergoing radiotherapy (RT) for prostate cancer in Canada. Patterns of care were determined by abstracting details of the patients' management from original records. The quality of patient's technical care was measured against a previously published, comprehensive suite of quality indicators.  Results:   32 of the 37 RT centres participated. The total study population of 810 patients included 25% low-risk, 44% intermediate-risk, and 28% high-risk cases. 649 received external beam RT (EBRT) only, for whom compliance with 12 indicators of the quality of pre-treatment assessment ranged from 56% (sexual function documented) to 96% (staging bone scan obtained in high-risk patients). Compliance with treatment-related indicators ranged from 78% (dose to prostate ≥74 Gy in intermediate risk patients not receiving hormone therapy) to 100% (3DCRT or IMRT plan). Compliance varied among centres; no centre demonstrated 100% compliance on all indicators and every centre was 100% compliant on at least some indicators. The number of assessment-related indicators (n=13) with which a given centre was 100% compliant ranged from 4 to 11 (median 7) and the number of the treatment-specific indicators (n=8) with which a given centre was 100% compliant ranged from 6 to 8 (median 8). ADT therapy was utilised in most high-risk cases (191, 92.3%).  Conclusions:   While patterns of prostate cancer care in Canada vary somewhat, compliance on the majority of quality indicators is very high. However, all centres showed room for improvement on several indicators and few individual patients received care that met target benchmarks on all quality measures. This variation is particularly important for indicators such as delivered dose where impact on disease outcome is known to exist, and suggests that quality improvement programmes have the potential to further improve quality of care.""","""['Michael Brundage', 'Brita Danielson', 'Robert Pearcey', 'Brenda Bass', 'Tom Pickles', 'Jean-Paul Bahary', 'Yingwei Peng', 'David Wallace', 'William Mackillop']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Radiother Oncol""","""[""Quality indicators for prostate radiotherapy: are patients disadvantaged by receiving treatment in a 'generalist' centre?"", 'Quality of care indicators and their related outcomes: a population-based study in prostate cancer patients treated with radiotherapy.', 'Treatment choice and quality of care for men with localized prostate cancer.', ""External beam radiotherapy in bone metastatic prostate cancer: impact on patients' pain relief and quality of life."", 'Assessing the quality of prostate cancer care.', 'Inappropriate use of clinical practices in Canada: a systematic review.', 'A population-based study of administrative data linkage to measure melanoma surgical and pathology quality.', 'Utilization of Prostate Cancer Quality Metrics for Research and Quality Improvement: A Structured Review.', 'Contemporary prostate cancer radiation therapy in the United States: Patterns of care and compliance with quality measures.', 'Quality assessment in prostate cancer centers certified by the German Cancer Society.']"""

Previously, we identified a rare intronic mutation on EMSY (11q13.5) that increases the risk of aggressive PrCa and associates with familial PrCa. Here, we further study the genetic structure and variants of the PrCa susceptibility region 11q13.5.  Methods:   This study included 2716 unselected hospital-based PrCa cases, 1318 cases of a screening trial and 908 controls of Finnish origin. We imputed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and structural variants from the 1000 Genomes Project and validated the associations of the variants in two PrCa patient sets by genotyping. Genetic structure was studied with haplotype analysis.  Results:   Two independent regions at 11q13.5 were associated with PrCa risk. The most significant association was at EMSY (rs10899221, odds ratio (OR) 1.29-1.40, P=3.5 × 10(-4)-0.002) near the previously identified mutation. Correlated intronic SNPs rs10899221 and rs72944758 formed with other EMSY variants common and rare haplotypes that were associated with increased risk (P=4.0 × 10(-4)) and decreased risk (P=0.01) of PrCa, respectively. The other associated region was intergenic. Among the six validated variants, rs12277366 was significant in both patient sets (OR 1.15-1.17, P=0.01). Haplotypes associated with an increased risk (P=0.02) and a decreased risk (P=0.02) were identified. In addition, the intergenic region was strongly associated with PrCa death, with the most significant association at rs12277366 (OR=0.72, P=4.8 × 10(-5)).

The 24 patients were then replanned to obtain maximally reduced rectum D35. Next, the newly derived plans were added to the database to replace the original clinical plans, and new predictions of the lowest achievable rectum D35 were made.  Results:   After replanning, the rectum D35 reduced by 9.3 Gy±6.1 (average±1 SD; p<0.001) compared to the original plan. The first predictions of the rectum D35 were 4.8 Gy±4.2 (average±1 SD; p<0.001) too high when evaluated with the new plans.

Human endogenous retrovirus K (HERV-K) of the HML2 subtype is the most recently integrated and most intact retrovirus in the human genome, with many of the viral genomes encoding full- or partial-length viral proteins. To assess transcripts of HERV-K in prostate cancer cell lines and identify the specific HERV-K elements in the human genome that are transcribed, reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) and cDNA sequencing were undertaken. Strand-specific RT-PCR, plasmid subcloning, and cDNA sequencing detected the presence of HERV-K(HML2) coding strand transcripts within four prostate cell lines (LNCaP, DU145, PC3, and VCaP). RT-PCR across splice junctions revealed splicing variants for env gene mRNA in three cell lines, two involving previously undescribed alternative splice sites. To determine the HERV-K loci from which the transcripts arose, RepeatMasker was used to compile a list of over 200 HERV-K internal genome segment fragments and over 1,000 HERV-K solo long terminal repeat (LTR) fragments in the human genome. Surprisingly, the sequences identified from internal positions of the viral genome were mostly smaller segments, while the LTRs were relatively intact. Possible reasons for this are discussed. The transcripts in the cell lines tested, arose from several HERV-K loci, with some proviruses being detected in multiple cell lines and others in only one of the four used. In some instances, transcripts from viral antisense strands was also detected. In addition, transcripts from both strands of solo LTRs were detected. These data show that transcripts from HERV-K loci commonly occur in prostate cancer cell lines and that transcription of either strand can occur. They also emphasize the importance of single nucleotide level analysis to identify the specific, individual HERV-K loci that are transcribed, and indicate that HERV-K expression in prostate cancer warrants further study.""","""['Lorenzo Agoni', 'Chandan Guha', 'Jack Lenz']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Front Oncol""","""['Variant splicing and influence of ionizing radiation on human endogenous retrovirus K (HERV-K) transcripts in cancer cell lines.', 'Expression of human endogenous retrovirus k envelope transcripts in human breast cancer.', 'Human endogenous retrovirus HERV-K14 families: status, variants, evolution, and mobilization of other cellular sequences.', 'Molecular biology of type A endogenous retrovirus.', 'HERV-K: the biologically most active human endogenous retrovirus family.', 'Human endogenous retrovirus K contributes to a stem cell niche in glioblastoma.', 'Origin and functional role of antisense transcription in endogenous and exogenous retroviruses.', 'Expression of Human Endogenous Retrovirus Group K (HERV-K) HML-2 Correlates with Immune Activation of Macrophages and Type I Interferon Response.', 'Human Endogenous Retroviruses: Friends and Foes in Urology Clinics.', 'A Systems Biology Approach on the Regulatory Footprint of Human Endogenous Retroviruses (HERVs).']"""

We prospectively compared PCa prevalence in CAU and ASI men from specific populations with low penetrance of prostate-specific antigen screening.  Methods:   Prostate glands were prospectively obtained during autopsy from men who died from causes other than PCa in Moscow, Russia (CAU), and Tokyo, Japan (ASI). Prostates were removed en-block and analyzed in toto. We compared across the 2 populations PCa prevalence, number and Gleason score (GS) of tumour foci, pathological stage, spatial location, and tumor volume using χ(2), Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon tests, and multiple logistic regression. All statistical tests were two-sided.  Results:   Three hundred twenty prostates were collected, 220 from CAU men and 100 from ASI mean. The mean age was 62.5 in CAU men and 68.5 years in ASI men (P < .001). PCa prevalences of 37.3% in CAU men and 35.0% in ASI men were observed (P = .70). Average tumor volume was 0.303cm(3). In men aged greater than 60 years, PCa was observed in more than 40% of prostates, reaching nearly 60% in men aged greater than 80 years. GS 7 or greater cancers accounted for 23.1% and 51.4% of all PCa in CAU and ASI men, respectively, (P = .003). When adjusted for age and prostate weight, ASI men still had a greater probability of having GS 7 or greater PCa (P = .03).  Conclusions:   PCa is found on autopsy in a similar proportion of Russian and Japanese men. More than 50% of cancers in ASI and nearly 25% of cancers in CAU men have a GS of 7 or greater.

The Cox proportional hazard regression was used for inferences about the relationship of time to BF and GS. Harrell's C-index (HCI) was used to assess concordance in the Cox regression between predicted and observed events. The discordance rate was 26% for any change in either major or minor Gleason pattern. In the RI GS 2 through 6 group, 79 (8%) patients were upgraded to GS 7. Twenty percent of patients with RI GS 7 were downgraded and 2% were upgraded. In the RI GS 8 through 9 group, 58% were downgraded to GS 6 (12%) or GS 7 (88%). The FCCC GS altered the NCCN risk group assignment in 144 men (9%): 92 (64%) men to lower risk and 52 (36%) to higher risk. FCCC GS was a stronger predictor of BF; the hazard ratios for GS 2 through 6 (ref), 3+4, 4+3, and 8 through 9 were 1.00 (ref), 1.82, 4.14, and 2.92, respectively.

Use of statin drugs, which are prescribed to lower cholesterol and appear to reduce inflammation, may decrease the incidence or progression of LUTS. The associations of statin drug use with LUTS incidence and progression were prospectively evaluated in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study from 1992 to 2008. Hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals of incident LUTS (from no or a low International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) of 0-7 to a moderate or worse IPSS of ≥15; n = 5,790 cases in 24,715 men) and of LUTS progression (from modest IPSS of 8-14 to severe IPSS of ≥20; n = 2,238 cases in 8,709 men) were calculated comparing current statin use with nonuse. The hazard ratios of LUTS incidence and progression comparing current use to nonuse were greater than 1. However, when comparisons were restricted to participants who used drugs to treat hypertension (a surrogate for uptake of medical care), statin use was not associated with LUTS incidence (hazard ratio = 1.02, 95% confidence interval: 0.94, 1.12) or progression (hazard ratio = 0.98, 95% confidence interval: 0.85, 1.13).

Caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) is a promising component of propolis that possesses SERM activity. This study aimed at investigating the modulatory impact of CAPE on docetaxel (DOC) and paclitaxel (PTX) cytotoxicity in prostate cancer cells and exploring the possible underlying mechanisms for this chemomodulation. CAPE significantly increased DOC and PTX potency in PC-3, DU-145 and LNCaP prostate cancer cells. Combination index calculations showed synergistic interaction of CAPE/DOC and CAPE/PTX cotreatments in all the tested cell lines. Subsequent mechanistic studies in PC-3 cells indicated that cyclin D1 and c-myc were significantly reduced in the combined treatment groups with concurrent increase in p27kip. DNA-ploidy analysis indicated a significant increase in the percentage of cells in pre-G1 in CAPE/DOC and CAPE/PTX cotreatments. Decreased Bcl-2/Bax ratio together with increased caspase-3 activity and protein abundance were observed in the same groups. Estrogen receptor-β (ER-β) and its downstream tumor suppressor forkhead box O1 levels were significantly elevated in CAPE and combination groups compared to DOC or PTX-alone. ER-α and insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor protein abundance were reduced in the same groups. CAPE significantly reduced AKT, ERK and ER-α (Ser-167) phosphorylation in PC-3 cells. CAPE-induced inhibition of AKT phosphorylation was more prominent (1.7-folds higher) in cells expressing ER-α such as PC-3 compared to LNCaP. In conclusion, CAPE enhances the antiproliferative and cytotoxic effects of DOC and PTX in prostate cancer cells. This can be, at least partly, attributed to CAPE augmentation of DOC and PTX proapoptotic effects in addition to CAPE-induced alterations in ER-α and ER-β abundance.""","""['Mai F Tolba', 'Ahmed Esmat', 'Ahmed M Al-Abd', 'Samar S Azab', 'Amani E Khalifa', 'Hisham A Mosli', 'Sherif Z Abdel-Rahman', 'Ashraf B Abdel-Naim']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""IUBMB Life""","""['Combination treatment of docetaxel with caffeic acid phenethyl ester suppresses the survival and the proliferation of docetaxel-resistant prostate cancer cells via induction of apoptosis and metabolism interference.', 'Inhibiting the NF-κB pathway enhances the antitumor effect of cabazitaxel by downregulating Bcl-2 in pancreatic cancer.', 'Caffeic acid phenethyl ester induced cell cycle arrest and growth inhibition in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells via regulation of Skp2, p53, p21Cip1 and p27Kip1.', 'The anticancer mechanism of caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE): review of melanomas, lung and prostate cancers.', 'Caffeic Acid phenethyl ester is a potential therapeutic agent for oral cancer.', 'STEAP1 Knockdown Decreases the Sensitivity of Prostate Cancer Cells to Paclitaxel, Docetaxel and Cabazitaxel.', 'Propolis: A Detailed Insight of Its Anticancer Molecular Mechanisms.', 'Identification of new benzimidazole-triazole hybrids as anticancer agents: multi-target recognition, in\xa0vitro and in silico studies.', 'Design and synthesis of novel quinazolinone-based derivatives as EGFR inhibitors with antitumor activity.', 'Combination treatment of docetaxel with caffeic acid phenethyl ester suppresses the survival and the proliferation of docetaxel-resistant prostate cancer cells via induction of apoptosis and metabolism interference.']"""

Methods and materials:   A total of 2752 patients were treated for prostate cancer between October 1990 and April 2007 with either low-dose-rate brachytherapy alone or in combination with androgen depletion therapy (ADT) or external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) and were followed for a median of 5.86 years (minimum 1.0 years; maximum 19.19 years). We investigated the 10-year incidence, nature, and treatment of acute and chronic rectal toxicities following BT. Using univariate, and multivariate analyses, we determined the treatment and comorbidity factors predisposing to rectal toxicities. We also outline the most common and effective management for these toxicities.  Results:   Actuarial risk of ≥ grade 2 rectal bleeding was 6.4%, though notably only 0.9% of all patients required medical intervention to manage this toxicity. The majority of rectal bleeding episodes (72%) occurred within the first 3 years following placement of BT seeds. Of the 27 patients requiring management for their rectal bleeding, 18 underwent formalin treatment and nine underwent cauterization. Post-hoc univariate statistical analysis revealed that coronary artery disease (CAD), biologically effective dose, rectal volume receiving 100% of the prescription dose (RV100), and treatment modality predict the likelihood of grade ≥2 rectal bleeding. Only CAD, treatment type, and RV100 fit a Cox regression multivariate model.  Conclusions:   Low-dose-rate prostate brachytherapy is very well tolerated and rectal bleeding toxicities are either self-resolving or effectively managed by medical intervention.

The aim of this study was to examine the role of CCL2 in integrin expression and migratory activity in prostate cancers.  Methods:   Prostate cancer migration was examined using Transwell, wound healing, and invasion assay. The PKCδ and c-Src phosphorylations were examined by using western blotting. The qPCR was used to examine the mRNA expression of integrins. A transient transfection protocol was used to examine AP-1 activity.  Results:   Stimulation of prostate cancer cell lines (PC3, DU145, and LNCaP) induced migration and expression of integrin αvβ3. Treatment of cells with αvβ3 antibody or siRNA abolished CCL2-increased cell migration. CCL2-increased migration and integrin expression were diminished by CCR2 but not by CCR4 inhibitors, suggesting that the CCR2 receptor is involved in CCL2-promoted prostate cancer migration. CCL2 activated a signal transduction pathway that includes PKCδ, c-Src, and AP-1. Reagents that inhibit specific components of this pathway each diminished the ability of CCL2 to effect cell migration and integrin expression.  Conclusions:   Interaction between CCL2 and CCR2 enhances migration of prostate cancer cells through an increase in αvβ3 integrin production.  General significance:   CCL2 is a critical factor of prostate cancer metastasis.""","""['Tien-Huang Lin', 'Hsin-Ho Liu', 'Tsung-Hsun Tsai', 'Chi-Cheng Chen', 'Teng-Fu Hsieh', 'Shang-Sen Lee', 'Yuan-Ju Lee', 'Wen-Chi Chen', 'Chih-Hsin Tang']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Biochim Biophys Acta""","""['BKCa promotes growth and metastasis of prostate cancer through facilitating the coupling between αvβ3 integrin and FAK.', ""Indole-3-carbinol and 3',3'-diindolylmethane modulate androgen's effect on C-C chemokine ligand 2 and monocyte attraction to prostate cancer cells."", 'Bradykinin enhances cell migration in human prostate cancer cells through B2 receptor/PKCδ/c-Src dependent signaling pathway.', 'Multiple roles of chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 in promoting prostate cancer growth.', 'CCL2/CCR2 signaling in cancer pathogenesis.', 'The Emerging Role of Cell Adhesion Molecules on Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia.', 'Serum CCL2 Is a Prognostic Biomarker for Non-Metastatic Castration-Sensitive Prostate Cancer.', 'The Key Network of mRNAs and miRNAs Regulated by HIF1A in Hypoxic Hepatocellular Carcinoma Cells.', 'Thromboinflammatory Processes at the Nexus of Metabolic Dysfunction and Prostate Cancer: The Emerging Role of Periprostatic Adipose Tissue.', 'Plasma Chemokine C-C Motif Ligand 2 as a Potential Biomarker for Prostate Cancer.']"""

We also studied the therapeutic effects of MALAT-1 silencing on castration resistant prostate cancer cells in vitro and in vivo.  Materials and methods:   Quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction was used to detect MALAT-1 expression in prostate cancer tissues and cell lines. siRNA against MALAT-1 was designed and the silencing effect was examined by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. The biological effects of MALAT-1 siRNA on cells were investigated by examining cell proliferation using a cell counting kit and cell colony assays as well as cell migration by in vitro scratch assay, cell invasion by Transwell® invasion assay and cell cycle by flow cytometry. We further investigated the effect of therapeutic siRNA targeting MALAT-1 on castration resistant prostate cancer in vivo.  Results:   MALAT-1 was up-regulated in human prostate cancer tissues and cell lines. Higher MALAT-1 expression correlated with high Gleason score, prostate specific antigen, tumor stage and castration resistant prostate cancer. MALAT-1 down-regulation by siRNA inhibited prostate cancer cell growth, invasion and migration, and induced castration resistant prostate cancer cell cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phases. Importantly, intratumor delivery of therapeutic siRNA targeting MALAT-1 elicited delayed tumor growth and reduced metastasis of prostate cancer xenografts in castrated male nude mice, followed by the concomitant prolongation of survival of tumor bearing mice.  Conclusions:   MALAT-1 may be needed to maintain prostate tumorigenicity and it is involved in prostate cancer progression.

One of the main functions of 17β-HSD5 is to catalyze the conversion of the weak androgen, androstenedione, to the potent androgen, testosterone. The concentration of intraprostatic 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in patients following chemical or surgical castration has been reported to remain as high as 39% of that of healthy men, with 17β-HSD5 shown to be involved in this androgen synthesis. Inhibition of 17β-HSD5 therefore represents a promising target for the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). To investigate this, we conducted high-throughput screening (HTS) and identified compound 2, which displayed a structure distinct from known 17β-HSD5 inhibitors. To optimize the inhibitory activity of compound 2, we first introduced a primary alcohol group. We then converted the primary alcohol group to a tertiary alcohol, which further enhanced the inhibitory activity, improved metabolic stability, and led to the identification of compound 17. Oral administration of compound 17 to castrated nude mice bearing the CWR22R xenograft resulted in the suppression of androstenedione (AD)-induced intratumoral testosterone production.

This study aimed to compare the dosimetric results from the new partial-single arc (p-SA) technique with those from the f-SA technique in RapidArc planning for prostate cancer treatment. In this study, 10 patients with low-risk prostate cancer were selected. For each patient, two sets of RapidArc plans (f-SA and p-SA) were created in the Eclipse treatment planning system. The f-SA plan was created using one full arc, and the p-SA plan was created using planning parameters identical to those of the f-SA plan but with anterior and posterior avoidance sectors. Various dosimetric parameters of the f-SA and p-SA plans were evaluated and compared for the same target coverage and identical plan optimization parameters. The f-SA and p-SA plans showed an average difference of ±1% for the doses to the planning target volume (PTV), and there were no clear differences in dose homogeneity or plan conformity. In comparison to the f-SA technique, the p-SA technique reduced the doses to the rectum by approximately 6.1% to 21.2%, to the bladder by approximately 10.3% to 29.5%, and to the penile bulb by approximately 2.2%. In contrast, the dose to the femoral heads, the integral dose, and the number of monitor units were higher in the p-SA plans by approximately 34.4%, 7.7%, and 9.2%, respectively. In conclusion, it is feasible to use the p-SA technique for RapidArc planning for prostate cancer treatment.

Aim:   To assess pharmacists' ability to detect ED and encourage patients to seek medical evaluation.  Methods:   This observational study conducted in Greece and Spain included men without a valid prescription for an ED medication but with a history indicating ED risk and/or who consulted a pharmacist about ED. Pharmacists completed a questionnaire about the patient. Patients completed the Sexual Health Inventory for Men (SHIM); men with a score ≤21 (cutoff for ED) were educated (by case pharmacists) and referred and encouraged to see a physician (by case and control pharmacists).  Main outcome measures:   Proportion of men with a SHIM score ≤21 and, of those, the proportion who visited a physician and credited the pharmacist for their visit. ANCOVA and chi-square test were used for continuous and categorical data, respectively.  Results:   Among the 451 men (mean ± SD age, 54.9 ± 12.9 years) questioned about ED, 90% had a risk factor (usually hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, or diabetes), 28% had a previous diagnosis, 36% sought internet information, 38% self-medicated, 10% took medication obtained outside the pharmacy setting, and the first health care professional approached was a pharmacist (50%), physician (18%), or nurse (1%) at a median of 6 (range, 0-360) months after symptom onset. The SHIM score was ≤21 in 348 (77%) men. A lower score (indicating increased ED severity) was associated with increased age and with benign prostate hyperplasia, depression, diabetes, or prostate cancer. In the minority of men contacted for follow-up, less than one-third had visited their physician, despite pharmacist encouragement.  Conclusions:   Pharmacists are often the first health care contact regarding ED and are highly accurate in its detection. Further research is needed to optimize the pharmacist's role in early detection, education, and motivating patients to be evaluated by a physician.""","""['Antonio Martin Morales', 'Dimitris Hatzichristou', 'Joan Ramon Lladós', 'Virginia Pascual Renedo', 'Apostolia Pimenidou']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Sex Med""","""['The EPIFARM study: an observational study in 574 community pharmacies in Spain characterizing patient profiles of men asking for erectile dysfunction medication.', 'A feasibility study comparing pharmacist and physician recommendations for sildenafil treatment.', ""Characterization of patients' requests and pharmacists' professional practice in oropharyngeal condition in Spain."", 'Erectile dysfunction in the cardiac patient: how common and should we treat?', ""Pharmacists' Knowledge and Perceptions of Health Literacy."", 'Sexual and reproductive health services provided by community pharmacists: a scoping review.', 'm-Health views and perception among Malaysian: findings from a survey among individuals living in Selangor.', 'Role and impact of pharmacists in Spain: a scoping review.', 'Is there potential for the future provision of triage services in community pharmacy?']"""

When the endpoints are survival outcomes, the study of agreement becomes more challenging given the special characteristics of time-to-event data. In this article, we propose a new framework for assessing agreement based on survival processes that can be viewed as a natural representation of time-to-event outcomes. Our new agreement measure is formulated as the chance-corrected concordance between survival processes. It provides a new perspective for studying the relationship between correlated survival outcomes and offers an appealing interpretation as the agreement between survival times on the absolute distance scale.

Little is known about the role of primary cilia in preinvasive and invasive prostate cancer. However, reduced cilia expression has been observed in human cancers including pancreatic cancer, renal cell carcinoma, breast cancer, cholangiocarcinoma, and melanoma. The aim of this study was to characterize primary cilia expression in preinvasive and invasive human prostate cancer, and to investigate the correlation between primary cilia and the Wnt signaling pathway. Human prostate tissues representative of stages of prostate cancer formation (normal prostate, prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN), and invasive prostate cancer (including perineural invasion)) were stained for ciliary proteins. The frequency of primary cilia was determined. A decrease in the percentage of ciliated cells in PIN, invasive cancer and perineural invasion lesions was observed when compared to normal. Cilia lengths were also measured to indirectly test functionality. Cilia were shorter in PIN, cancer, and perineural invasion lesions, suggesting dysfunction. Primary cilia have been shown to suppress the Wnt pathway. Increased Wnt signaling has been implicated in prostate cancer. Therefore, we investigated a correlation between loss of primary cilia and increased Wnt signaling in normal prostate and in preinvasive and invasive prostate cancer. To investigate Wnt signaling in our cohort, serial tissue sections were stained for β-catenin as a measure of Wnt signaling. Nuclear β-catenin was analyzed and Wnt signaling was found to be higher in un-ciliated cells in the normal prostate, PIN, a subset of invasive cancers, and perineural invasion. Our results suggest that cilia normally function to suppress the Wnt signaling pathway in epithelial cells and that cilia loss may play a role in increased Wnt signaling in some prostate cancers. These results suggest that cilia are dysfunctional in human prostate cancer, and increase Wnt signaling occurs in a subset of cancers.""","""['Nadia B Hassounah', 'Ray Nagle', 'Kathylynn Saboda', 'Denise J Roe', 'Bruce L Dalkin', 'Kimberly M McDermott']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in a subpopulation of murine prostate luminal epithelial cells induces high grade prostate intraepithelial neoplasia.', 'Characterization of Notch Signalling Pathway Members in Normal Prostate, Prostatic Intraepithelial Neoplasia (PIN) and Prostatic Adenocarcinoma.', 'The metastasis suppressor CD82/KAI1 represses the TGF-β 1 and Wnt signalings inducing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition linked to invasiveness of prostate cancer cells.', 'Precursors of prostate cancer.', 'Exploring the Wnt Pathway as a Therapeutic Target for Prostate Cancer.', 'Cilia and Cancer: From Molecular Genetics to Therapeutic Strategies.', 'Signaling Switching from Hedgehog-GLI to MAPK Signaling Potentially Serves as a Compensatory Mechanism in Melanoma Cell Lines Resistant to GANT-61.', 'Cholesterol in the ciliary membrane as a therapeutic target against cancer.', 'An actin filament branching surveillance system regulates cell cycle progression, cytokinesis and primary ciliogenesis.', 'Analysis of Primary Cilium Expression and Hedgehog Pathway Activation in Mesothelioma Throws Back Its Complex Biology.']"""

Thiosulfate is a naturally occurring product of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) metabolism. H2S is involved in many physiological and pathological processes including inflammation and tumorigenesis.  Methods:   The determination of thiosulfate in the urine of PCa patients and healthy controls was performed by reverse-phased liquid chromatography using 2-chloro-1-methylquinolinium tetrafluoroborate as a derivatization reagent. Thiosulfate concentrations were normalized to urinary creatinine levels to compensate for variable diuresis.  Results:   In the urine samples of PCa patients, the mean thiosulfate level was almost 50 times higher than in the control groups and five times higher than in the benign prostatic hyperplasia group. The level of thiosulfate did not correlate with the serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level or PSA density. Neither tumor stage nor tumor grade was associated with thiosulfate level.  Conclusions:   The results suggest that thiosulfate concentration in urine may be a good facilitator in the diagnostics of PCa.

This case-cohort study examines associations between plasma phospholipid fatty acids and prostate cancer risk among participants in the Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial.  Methods:   Case subjects were 834 men diagnosed with prostate cancer, of which 156 had high-grade cancer. The subcohort consisted of 1393 men selected randomly at baseline and from within strata frequency matched to case subjects on age and race. Proportional hazards models estimated hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for associations between fatty acids and prostate cancer risk overall and by grade. All statistical tests were two-sided.  Results:   Compared with men in the lowest quartiles of LCω-3PUFA, men in the highest quartile had increased risks for low-grade (HR = 1.44, 95% CI = 1.08 to 1.93), high-grade (HR = 1.71, 95% CI = 1.00 to 2.94), and total prostate cancer (HR = 1.43, 95% CI = 1.09 to 1.88). Associations were similar for individual long-chain ω-3 fatty acids. Higher linoleic acid (ω-6) was associated with reduced risks of low-grade (HR = 0.75, 95% CI = 0.56 to 0.99) and total prostate cancer (HR = 0.77, 95% CI = 0.59 to 1.01); however, there was no dose response.  Conclusions:   This study confirms previous reports of increased prostate cancer risk among men with high blood concentrations of LCω-3PUFA.

It was the aim of this study to further study the clinical relevance of SPINK1 expression and its relationship with other key genomic alterations of prostate cancer.  Methods:   A tissue microarray containing more than 10,000 prostate cancers with clinical follow-up was used for immunohistochemical SPINK1 analysis. Data on ERG status as well as PTEN, 6q, 5q, and 3p deletions were available for comparison.  Results:   SPINK1 expression was absent in benign prostate glands and detectable in 5.9% of 9,503 interpretable prostate cancers. Presence of SPINK1 expression was markedly more frequent in ERG negative (10.4%) than in ERG positive cancers (0.3%; P < 0.0001). However, SPINK1 expression was unrelated to tumor phenotype and biochemical recurrence in all cancers and in the subgroup of ERG negative cancers.

The goal of the current study was to examine patterns of care in patients with a pathologic indication for postprostatectomy radiotherapy (RT) using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare-linked database.  Methods:   A total of 3460 men treated with radical prostatectomy for localized prostate cancer between 2000 and 2006 with at least 1 adverse pathologic factor and at least 3 years of claims data after surgery were included. Medicare claims through December 31, 2009 were examined. Rates of postprostatectomy hormonal therapy, RT, or both were examined. Logistic regression analysis examined potential factors associated with the receipt and timing of RT.  Results:   Within 3 years after surgery, 1076 patients (31%) received some form of further therapy, including 850 (25%) who received RT. Receipt of RT was < 35% in all subgroups including every year of study. Fewer than one-half of patients who received RT (43%) did so within 6 months of surgery. On multivariate analysis, pathologic T classification and tumor grade were associated with receipt of RT within 6 months or 3 years of surgery, as were younger age, geographic region, and population density.

MDV3100 (enzalutamide), an antagonist of the androgen receptor (AR), was approved for clinical use in men with metastatic CRPC. Although this compound showed clinical efficacy, many initial responders later developed resistance. To uncover relevant resistant mechanisms, we developed a model of spontaneous resistance to MDV3100 in LNCaP prostate cancer cells. Detailed characterization revealed that emergence of an F876L mutation in AR correlated with blunted AR response to MDV3100 and sustained proliferation during treatment. Functional studies confirmed that AR(F876L) confers an antagonist-to-agonist switch that drives phenotypic resistance. Finally, treatment with distinct antiandrogens or cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)4/6 inhibitors effectively antagonized AR(F876L) function. Together, these findings suggest that emergence of F876L may (i) serve as a novel biomarker for prediction of drug sensitivity, (ii) predict a ""withdrawal"" response to MDV3100, and (iii) be suitably targeted with other antiandrogens or CDK4/6 inhibitors.

Although local tumor control is important, for most human cancers, new therapies must also target metastatic disease if they are to have an impact on survival. Here, we test the hypothesis that adding cytokine gene therapy to our multimodal platform improves both local and metastatic tumor control in a preclinical model of prostate cancer. An oncolytic adenovirus (Ad5-yCD/mutTKSR39rep-mIL12) expressing two suicide genes and mouse interleukin-12 (IL-12) was generated. Relative to an adenovirus lacking IL-12 (Ad5-yCD/mutTKSR39rep), Ad5-yCD/mutTKSR39rep-mIL12 improved local and metastatic tumor control in the TRAMP-C2 prostate adenocarcinoma model, resulting in a significant increase in survival. Ad5-yCD/mutTKSR39rep-mIL12 resulted in high levels of IL-12 and interferon gamma in serum and tumor, increased natural killer (NK) and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte lytic activities, and the development of tumor-specific antitumor immunity. Immune cell depletion studies indicated that both the innate and adaptive arms of immunity were required for maximal Ad5-yCD/mutTKSR39rep-mIL12 activity.

Participants were followed up until first cancer diagnosis, death, transfer out of the database or end of available records.  Results:   The mean age of the sample was 71.6 years (SD 9.0), 73% were female. Median follow-up time was 7.8 years (IQR 3.4, 12.3). 667 (23.2%) people with a PMR diagnosis developed cancer compared with 1938 (19.5%) of those without PMR. There was an interaction between PMR status and time. In the first 6 months after diagnosis, those with a PMR diagnosis were significantly more likely to receive a cancer diagnosis (adjusted HR (95% CI): 1.69 (1.18 to 2.42)). The number of events was small, but occurrences of prostate, blood, lymph nodes, female reproductive and nervous system cancers may be more common in those with PMR in the first 6 months after PMR diagnosis.  Conclusions:   An increase in the rate of cancer diagnoses was noted in the first 6 months of observation, but we were unable to determine whether the cancer incidence in PMR was different from controls, beyond this time point. Clinicians should ensure they fully exclude cancer as a cause of PMR-like symptoms and monitor patients for possible malignancies.""","""['Sara Muller', 'Samantha L Hider', 'John Belcher', 'Toby Helliwell', 'Christian D Mallen']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Ann Rheum Dis""","""['Incidence, prevalence and treatment burden of polymyalgia rheumatica in the UK over two decades: a population-based study.', 'Comorbidities in patients with polymyalgia rheumatica prior to and following diagnosis: A case control and cohort study.', 'Risk of vascular events in patients with polymyalgia rheumatica.', 'The real evidence for polymyalgia rheumatica as a paraneoplastic syndrome.', 'Polymyalgia rheumatica and risk of coronary artery disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies.', 'A Case of Localized Prostate Cancer Associated with Polymyalgia Rheumatica with Marked Symptomatic Improvement after Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy.', 'The fast-track outpatient clinic significantly decreases hospitalisation rates among polymyalgia rheumatica patients.', '""The added value of 18f-FDG PET/CT in the assessment of onset and steroid resistant polimyalgia rheumatica"".', 'Polymyalgia rheumatica: A case series from Colombia and analysis of Latin America.', 'The frequency of occult solid malignancy in patients with polymyalgia rheumatica-like symptoms.']"""

Method:   By using deidentified administrative databases at the Manitoba Centre for Health Policy, a 1:3 matched cohort of decedents aged ≥ 10 years in fiscal years April 1995-March 2008 (n = 3,943 with schizophrenia; n = 11,827 without schizophrenia) was selected and matched on age, sex, geography, and date of death ± 2 months. Schizophrenia was defined as ICD-9-CM code 295 or ICD-10-CA codes F20, F21, F23.2, or F25 in hospital/physician files at least once within 12 years of death.  Results:   The median age at death was 77 years. The attributable percentage of deaths was higher for respiratory illnesses (all ages) and suicide (age 10-59 years only), similar for circulatory illnesses, and lower for cancer in decedents with schizophrenia compared to matched controls. For cancer deaths, decedents with schizophrenia were equally likely to die of gastrointestinal, breast, or prostate cancer, but more likely to die of lung cancer at ages 10-59 (32.5% versus 20.6%, P < .004). Place of death was more likely a nursing home (29.7% vs 13.9%) and less likely a hospital (55.5% vs 70.5%) (P < .0001) for decedents with schizophrenia overall and by specific cause, with the exception of suicide deaths showing no difference by place. Except for those who died in nursing homes, decedents with schizophrenia had higher general practitioner but lower specialist rates and inpatient hospital separations.

This study examined whether choice of operation and results of surgery for rectourethral fistula are influenced by prior radiotherapy.  Method:   Male patients undergoing surgery for rectourethral fistula were identified from a prospectively maintained database. Data regarding aetiology, surgical treatment and outcomes were analysed.  Results:   Fifty patients (median age = 65.5 years) were identified. Radiation was received by 29 patients for prostate or rectal cancer, and 21 patients developed a fistula following prostatectomy, Crohn's disease or pelvic fracture (without radiation). Prior to definitive surgery, 30 patients underwent fecal diversion and 37 underwent urinary diversion. In total, 57 repairs were performed (44 patients had one repair, five patients had two and one patient had three). Definitive surgery was approached predominantly abdominally in radiated patients (90.6 vs 9.3%, P < 0.001) and perineally in nonradiated patients (80 vs 20%, P < 0.001). Successful primary fistula repair was more frequent in the nonradiated group compared with the radiated group (80.9 vs 0%, P < 0.001).

However, androgen-refractory PC cells inevitably emerge from the androgen-responsive tumor, leading to incurable disease. Recent studies have shown AD induces cellular senescence, a phenomenon that is cell-autonomously tumor-suppressive but which confers tumor-promoting adaptations that can facilitate the advent of senescence-resistant malignant cell populations. Because androgen-refractory PC cells emerge clonally from the originally androgen-responsive tumor, we sought to investigate whether AD-induced senescence (ADIS) affects acquisition of androgen-refractory behavior in androgen-responsive LNCaP and LAPC4 prostate cancer cells. We find that repeated exposure of these androgen-responsive cells to senescence-inducing stimuli via cyclic AD leads to the rapid emergence of ADIS-resistant, androgen-refractory cells from the bulk senescent cell population. Our results show that the ADIS phenotype is associated with tumor-promoting traits, notably chemoresistance and enhanced pro-survival mechanisms such as inhibition of p53-mediated cell death, which encourage persistence of the senescent cells. We further find that pharmacologic enforcement of p53/Bax activation via Nutlin-3 prior to establishment of ADIS is required to overcome the associated pro-survival response and preferentially trigger pervasive cell death instead of senescence during AD. Thus our study demonstrates that ADIS promotes outgrowth of androgen-refractory PC cells and is consequently a suboptimal tumor-suppressor response to AD.""","""['Dominick G A Burton', 'Maria G Giribaldi', 'Anisleidys Munoz', 'Katherine Halvorsen', 'Asmita Patel', 'Merce Jorda', 'Carlos Perez-Stable', 'Priyamvada Rai']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Nkx3.1 and p27(KIP1) cooperate in proliferation inhibition and apoptosis induction in human androgen-independent prostate cancer cells.', 'MDM2 antagonists boost antitumor effect of androgen withdrawal: implications for therapy of prostate cancer.', 'CCAAT/Enhancer binding protein β controls androgen-deprivation-induced senescence in prostate cancer cells.', 'Sex steroid hormone metabolism and prostate cancer.', 'Androgen action in the prostate gland.', 'A GATA2-CDC6 axis modulates androgen receptor blockade-induced senescence in prostate cancer.', 'Androgen Deprivation Freezes Hormone-Sensitive Prostate Cancer Cells in a Reversible, Genetically Unstable Quasi-Apoptotic State, Bursting into Full Apoptosis upon Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibition.', 'Distinct mechanisms mediating therapy-induced cellular senescence in prostate cancer.', 'Targeting senescence as an anticancer therapy.', 'SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 subunit protein-mediated increase of beta-secretase 1 (BACE1) impairs human brain vessel cells.']"""

Here, we report the results of a clinical study on CTCs of advanced lung cancer patients in which we compared the MCA system with the CellSearch system, which employs the conventional EpCAM-based method.  Methods:   Paired peripheral blood samples were collected from 43 metastatic lung cancer patients to enumerate CTCs using the CellSearch system according to the manufacturer's protocol and the MCA system by immunolabeling and cytomorphological analysis. The presence of CTCs was assessed blindly and independently by both systems.  Results:   CTCs were detected in 17 of 22 NSCLC patients using the MCA system versus 7 of 22 patients using the CellSearch system. On the other hand, CTCs were detected in 20 of 21 small cell lung cancer (SCLC) patients using the MCA system versus 12 of 21 patients using the CellSearch system.

Here, we demonstrated the cell line specificity of integrin-linked kinase (ILK) versus mTORC2 as PDK2 in LNCaP and PC-3 prostate and MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells, of which the PTEN-negative status allowed the study of Ser473-Akt phosphorylation independent of external stimulation. PC-3 and MDA-MB-468 cells showed upregulated ILK expression relative to LNCaP cells, which expressed a high abundance of mTOR. Exposure to Ku-0063794, a second-generation mTOR inhibitor, decreased Ser473-Akt phosphorylation in LNCaP cells, but not in PC-3 or MDA-MB-468 cells. In contrast, treatment with T315, a novel ILK inhibitor, reduced the phosphorylation of Ser473-Akt in PC-3 and MDA-MB-468 cells without affecting that in LNCaP cells. This cell line specificity was verified by comparing Ser473-Akt phosphorylation status after genetic knockdown of rictor, ILK, and other putative Ser-473-Akt kinases. Genetic knockdown of rictor, but not ILK or the other kinases examined, inhibited Ser473-Akt phosphorylation in LNCaP cells. Conversely, PC-3 and MDA-MB-468 cells were susceptible to the effect of ILK silencing on Ser473-Akt phosphorylation, while knockdown of rictor or any of the other target kinases had no appreciable effect. Co-immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated the physical interaction between ILK and Akt in PC-3 cells, and T315 blocked ILK-mediated Ser473 phosphorylation of bacterially expressed Akt. ILK also formed complexes with rictor in PC-3 and MDA-MB-468 cells that were disrupted by T315, but such complexes were not observed in LNCaP cells. In the PTEN-functional MDA-MB-231 cell line, both T315 and Ku-0063794 suppressed EGF-induced Ser473-Akt phosphorylation.

Although the current cost of next generation sequencing is still exceeding that of microarray approaches, the rapid advances in NGS will likely make it the platform of choice for future research in differential gene expression. Connectivity mapping is a procedure for examining the connections among diseases, genes and drugs by differential gene expression initially based on microarray technology, with which a large collection of compound-induced reference gene expression profiles have been accumulated. In this work, we aim to test the feasibility of incorporating NGS RNA-Seq data into the current connectivity mapping framework by utilizing the microarray based reference profiles and the construction of a differentially expressed gene signature from a NGS dataset. This would allow for the establishment of connections between the NGS gene signature and those microarray reference profiles, alleviating the associated incurring cost of re-creating drug profiles with NGS technology. We examined the connectivity mapping approach on a publicly available NGS dataset with androgen stimulation of LNCaP cells in order to extract candidate compounds that could inhibit the proliferative phenotype of LNCaP cells and to elucidate their potential in a laboratory setting. In addition, we also analyzed an independent microarray dataset of similar experimental settings. We found a high level of concordance between the top compounds identified using the gene signatures from the two datasets. The nicotine derivative cotinine was returned as the top candidate among the overlapping compounds with potential to suppress this proliferative phenotype. Subsequent lab experiments validated this connectivity mapping hit, showing that cotinine inhibits cell proliferation in an androgen dependent manner. Thus the results in this study suggest a promising prospect of integrating NGS data with connectivity mapping.""","""['Darragh G McArt', 'Philip D Dunne', 'Jaine K Blayney', 'Manuel Salto-Tellez', 'Sandra Van Schaeybroeck', 'Peter W Hamilton', 'Shu-Dong Zhang']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Next generation mapping reveals novel large genomic rearrangements in prostate cancer.', 'Next-generation sequencing in the clinic: promises and challenges.', 'A gene-signature progression approach to identifying candidate small-molecule cancer therapeutics with connectivity mapping.', 'Ten years of next-generation sequencing technology.', 'Rational experiment design for sequencing-based RNA structure mapping.', 'Patient-Derived Organoid Serves as a Platform for Personalized Chemotherapy in Advanced Colorectal Cancer Patients.', 'A Three-Genes Signature Predicting Colorectal Cancer Relapse Reveals LEMD1 Promoting CRC Cells Migration by RhoA/ROCK1 Signaling Pathway.', 'COMMD4 functions with the histone H2A-H2B dimer for the timely repair of DNA double-strand breaks.', 'Impact of Variable RNA-Sequencing Depth on Gene Expression Signatures and Target Compound Robustness: Case Study Examining Brain Tumor (Glioma) Disease Progression.', 'Systems healthcare: a holistic paradigm for tomorrow.']"""

The aim of the study is to identify potential biomarkers for early diagnosis of prostate cancer (PCa) among androgen-regulated genes (ARG) and to evaluate comparative expression of these genes in normal prostate and normal prostate-related androgen-sensitive tissues that do not (or rarely) give rise to cancer.  Methods:   ARG were selected in non-neoplastic adult human prostatic epithelial RWPE-1 cells stably expressing an exogenous human androgen receptor, using RNA-microarrays and validation by qRT-PCR. Expression of 48 preselected genes was quantified in tissue samples (seminal vesicles, prostate transitional zones and prostate cancers, benign prostatic hypertrophy obtained from surgical specimens) using TaqMan® low-density arrays. The diagnostic performances of these potential biomarkers were compared to that of genes known to be associated with PCa (i.e. PCA3 and DLX1).  Results and discussion:   By crossing expression studies in 26 matched PCa and normal prostate transitional zone samples, and 35 matched seminal vesicle and PCa samples, 14 genes were identified. Similarly, 9 genes were overexpressed in 15 benign prostatic hypertrophy samples, as compared to PCa samples. Overall, we selected 8 genes of interest to evaluate their diagnostic performances in comparison with that of PCA3 and DLX1. Among them, 3 genes: CRYAB, KCNMA1 and SDPR, were overexpressed in all 3 reference non-cancerous tissues. The areas under ROC curves of these genes reached those of PCA3 (0.91) and DLX1 (0.94).  Conclusions:   We identified ARG with reduced expression in PCa and with significant diagnostic values for discriminating between cancerous and non-cancerous prostatic tissues, similar that of PCA3. Given their expression pattern, they could be considered as potentially protective against prostate cancer. Moreover, they could be complementary to known genes overexpressed in PCa and included along with them in multiplex diagnostic tools.""","""['Dogus Murat Altintas', 'Nathalie Allioli', 'Myriam Decaussin', 'Simon de Bernard', 'Alain Ruffion', 'Jacques Samarut', 'Virginie Vlaeminck-Guillem']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Validation of Novel Biomarkers for Prostate Cancer Progression by the Combination of Bioinformatics, Clinical and Functional Studies.', 'Expression profile of an androgen regulated prostate specific homeobox gene NKX3.1 in primary prostate cancer.', 'The performance and limitations of PCA3, TMPRSS2:ERG, HOXC6 and DLX1 urinary markers combined in the improvement of prostate cancer diagnostics.', 'New targets for therapy in prostate cancer: differential display code 3 (DD3(PCA3)), a highly prostate cancer-specific gene.', 'New biomarkers in serum and urine for detection of prostate cancer.', 'Detection of genes with differential expression dispersion unravels the role of autophagy in cancer progression.', 'Immunomodulatory Role of Surfactant Protein-D in a Transgenic Adenocarcinoma of Mouse Prostate (TRAMP) Model.', 'Gene expression feature selection for prostate cancer diagnosis using a two-phase heuristic-deterministic search strategy.', 'The androgen receptor expression and its activity have different relationships with prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'Effect of upregulation of DD3 on early detection and prognosis in prostate cancer.']"""

It is expressed at elevated levels in prostate cancer. In view of the correlation between the expression levels of PSMA and disease grade and stage, PSMA is considered to be one of the most promising biomarkers in the diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer. In LNCaP cells PSMA undergoes internalization via clathrin-coated pits followed by accumulation in the endosomes. PSMA associates with different types of detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs) along the secretory pathway. Its mature form is mainly insoluble in Lubrol WX, but does not associate with Triton X-100-DRMs. To understand the mechanism of PSMA internalization we investigated its association during internalization with DRMs. For this purpose, internalization was induced by antibody cross-linking. We demonstrate at the biochemical and cell biological levels that: [i] exclusively homodimers of PSMA are associated with Lubrol WX-DRMs, [ii] antibody-induced cross-linking of PSMA molecules results in a time-dependent partitioning into another DRMs type, namely Triton X-100-DRMs, and [iii] concomitant with its association with Triton-X-100-DRMs internalization of PSMA occurs along tubulin filaments. In a previous work (Colombatti et al. (2009) PLoS One 4: e4608) we demonstrated that the small GTPases RAS and RAC1 and the MAPKs p38 and ERK1/2 are activated during antibody cross-linking. As downstream effects of this activation we observed a strong induction of NF-kB associated with an increased expression of IL-6 and CCL5 genes and that IL-6 and CCL5 enhanced the proliferative potential of LNCaP cells synergistically. These observations together with findings reported here hypothesize a fundamental role of DRMs during activation of PSMA as platforms for trafficking, endocytosis and signalling. Understanding these mechanisms constitutes an essential prerequisite for utilization of PSMA as a therapeutically suitable target in prostate cancer.""","""['Sonja Schmidt', 'Birthe Gericke', 'Giulio Fracasso', 'Dunia Ramarli', 'Marco Colombatti', 'Hassan Y Naim']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Different glycoforms of prostate-specific membrane antigen are intracellularly transported through their association with distinct detergent-resistant membranes.', 'The prostate specific membrane antigen regulates the expression of IL-6 and CCL5 in prostate tumour cells by activating the MAPK pathways.', 'Constitutive and antibody-induced internalization of prostate-specific membrane antigen.', 'Tumor target prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) and its regulation in prostate cancer.', 'Structure of detergent-resistant membrane domains: does phase separation occur in biological membranes?', 'The Potential of PSMA as a Vascular Target in TNBC.', 'Advances in PSMA theranostics.', 'The Multiple Roles and Therapeutic Potential of Molecular Chaperones in Prostate Cancer.', 'Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) assembles a macromolecular complex regulating growth and survival of prostate cancer cells ""in vitro"" and correlating with progression ""in vivo"".', 'The association between expressions of Ras and CD68 in the angiogenesis of breast cancers.']"""

Design, setting, and participants:   Randomized, double-blind trial conducted from July 1997 to May 2010 at 7 US centers comparing daily consumption of a soy protein supplement vs placebo in 177 men at high risk of recurrence after radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer. Supplement intervention was started within 4 months after surgery and continued for up to 2 years, with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) measurements made at 2-month intervals in the first year and every 3 months thereafter.  Intervention:   Participants were randomized to receive a daily serving of a beverage powder containing 20 g of protein in the form of either soy protein isolate (n=87) or, as placebo, calcium caseinate (n=90).  Main outcomes and measures:   Biochemical recurrence rate of prostate cancer (defined as development of a PSA level of ≥0.07 ng/mL) over the first 2 years following randomization and time to recurrence.  Results:   The trial was stopped early for lack of treatment effects at a planned interim analysis with 81 evaluable participants in the intervention group and 78 in the placebo group. Overall, 28.3% of participants developed biochemical recurrence within 2 years of entering the trial (close to the a priori predicted recurrence rate of 30%).

Its expression in cancers other than prostate, and its mechanism of activation, has not been reported. In silico analyses reveal that MAGEA11 is frequently expressed in human cancers, is increased during tumor progression, and correlates with poor prognosis and survival. In prostate and epithelial ovarian cancers (EOC), MAGEA11 expression was associated with promoter and global DNA hypomethylation, and with activation of other CG genes. Pharmacological or genetic inhibition of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) and/or histone deacetylases (HDACs) activated MAGEA11 in a cell line specific manner. MAGEA11 promoter activity was directly repressed by DNA methylation, and partially depended on Sp1, as pharmacological or genetic targeting of Sp1 reduced MAGEA11 promoter activity and endogenous gene expression. Importantly, DNA methylation regulated nucleosome occupancy specifically at the -1 positioned nucleosome of MAGEA11. Methylation of a single Ets site near the transcriptional start site (TSS) correlated with -1 nucleosome occupancy and, by itself, strongly repressed MAGEA11 promoter activity. Thus, DNA methylation regulates nucleosome occupancy at MAGEA11, and this appears to function cooperatively with sequence-specific transcription factors to regulate gene expression.

Methods:   PC3 prostate cancer cells were transfected with select Rab GTPase wild-type and dominant negative constructs. Effects of each Rab GTPase on endogenous cell surface expression of the individual receptors, along with the overexpressed CXCR4/CCR2 heterodimer, were determined by biotin-streptavidin cell surface assays.

Previous studies have shown an association between p53 gene mutations and cancer. However, the role of somatic TP53 mutations in the steep rise in cancer rates with aging has not been investigated at a population level. This relationship was quantified using the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) TP53 and GLOBOCAN cancer databases. The power function exponent of the cancer rate was calculated for 5-y age-standardized incidence or mortality rates for up to 25 cancer sites occurring in adults of median age 42 to 72 y. Linear regression analysis of the mean percentage of a cancer's TP53 mutations and the corresponding cancer exponent was conducted for four populations: worldwide, Japan, Western Europe, and the United States. Significant associations (P ≤ 0.05) were found for incidence rates but not mortality rates. Regardless of the population studied, positive associations were found for all cancer sites, with more significant associations for solid tumors, excluding the outlier prostate cancer or sex-related tumors. Worldwide and Japanese populations yielded P values as low as 0.002 and 0.005, respectively. For the United States, a significant association was apparent only when analysis utilized the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. This study found that TP53 mutations accounts for approximately one-quarter and one-third of the aging-related rise in the worldwide and Japanese incidence of all cancers, respectively. These significant associations between TP53 mutations and the rapid rise in cancer incidence with aging, considered with previously published literature, support a causal role for TP53 according to the Bradford-Hill criteria. However, questions remain concerning the contribution of TP53 mutations to neoplastic development and the role of factors such as genetic instability, obesity, and gene deficiencies other than TP53 that reduce p53 activity.""","""['Richard B Richardson']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Cell Cycle""","""['Clinicopathologic characteristics of brain tumors are associated with the presence and patterns of TP53 mutations: evidence from the IARC TP53 Database.', 'TP53 mutations as potential prognostic markers for specific cancers: analysis of data from The Cancer Genome Atlas and the International Agency for Research on Cancer TP53 Database.', 'Sarcomas in TP53 germline mutation carriers: a review of the IARC TP53 database.', 'TP53 Variations in Human Cancers: New Lessons from the IARC TP53 Database and Genomics Data.', 'Analysis of TP53 mutation spectra reveals the fingerprint of the potent environmental carcinogen, aristolochic acid.', 'Profound synchrony of age-specific incidence rates and tumor suppression for different cancer types as revealed by the multistage-senescence model of carcinogenesis.', 'Helicobacter pylori: a stealth assassin.', 'High-fluence light emitting diode-red light inhibits cell cycle progression in human dermal fibroblasts.', 'Studying nanoscale structural alterations in cancer cells to evaluate ovarian cancer drug treatment, using transmission electron microscopy imaging.', 'Tumor metabolism regulating chemosensitivity in ovarian cancer.']"""

The pain has dual origin: from the insertion of the probe as well as the biopsy itself. Periprostatic nerve block (PPNB) is currently the gold standard modality for decreasing pain of prostate biopsy but it does not alleviate the pain of probe insertion. A randomised controlled trial was performed to test the efficacy and safety of the combination of topical application of diltiazem gel and PPNB for pain control during transrectal ultrasonography guided prostate biopsy.  Methods:   A total of 73 patients who were to undergo their first prostate biopsy were randomised to receive either 2ml of 2% topical diltiazem gel or a placebo 15 minutes before the biopsy. All the patients then had a PPNB using 1% lignocaine. A ten- point visual analogue scale was used to record the pain immediately after the insertion of the probe and during the biopsy. Any adverse effects were also recorded.  Results:   There was no significant difference in the mean age and prostate volumes between the groups. There was a significantly lower mean pain score due to probe insertion in those patients who received topical diltiazem than in the placebo group (p<0.0001). There was no significant difference between the pain scores during the biopsy itself between the two groups.

Methods:   We analyzed the outcomes of 1599 patients with complete data regarding the sides of positive Bx and LN (lymph-node). By dividing each prostate into two separate sides, we assessed the accuracy of the side-specific Bx details in determining the side of positive nodes; the area under the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) (AUCs) was used. For patients with unilateral positive Bx, we assessed the risk of homolateral and contralateral LNMs according to the number of total Bx taken and the preoperative risk of LN invasion.  Results:   Considering the 3198 prostate sides, there was a strict correlation between the side of positive Bx and the side of LNMs. The ratio of positive/total Bx was more informative than the number of positive core. The AUC for ipsilateral LNMs was significantly higher than that for contralateral LNMs (P = 0.039). In the 805 patients with unilateral positive Bx, the percentage of contralateral LNMs was >30% even considering a more meticulous biopsy scheme and increased in the patients at a higher clinical risk for LN invasion.  Conclusion:   PCa preferentially metastasizes to ipsilateral LNs but >30% of contralateral LNMs are present.

Materials and methods:   We performed stereotactic biopsies on two prostate phantoms, which incorporate three randomly placed TRUS-visible lesions. Four stereotactic biopsies per lesion were taken under live-ultrasound guidance through a template: two biopsies with conventional beveled needles and two biopsies with novel trocar-sharpened needles. The procedural targeting error (PTE) between the virtually planned biopsy trajectory and the manually registered 3D needle position of every single biopsy core taken was calculated.  Results:   The absolute overall targeting error using the novel needle-tip design was 0.13 mm (SD: ± 0.15 mm) with the highest PTE in the sagittal plane (0.18 ± 0.16 mm), followed by the coronal (0.13 ± 0.17 mm) and axial (0.09 ± 0.05 mm) planes. Comparing the PTE of the novel trocar-shaped needles with conventional beveled needles, there was a statistically significant difference in the axial plane [p (overall) = 0.47, p(axial) = 0.03].  Conclusion:   The targeting error of stereotactic biopsies using trocar-sharpened needles is significantly lower than the targeting error of classical beveled needles. Thus, trocar-tip configurations improve the accuracy of computer-assisted biopsies and allow precise assessment of suspicious lesions in the prostate and in other organs accessible to image-guided biopsy.""","""['Timur H Kuru', 'Tobias Simpfendörfer', 'Matthias Roethke', 'Markus Hohenfellner', 'Boris A Hadaschik']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Urol Int""","""['Trocar-sharpened needles for image-guided prostate biopsy improve sample quality and performance: first clinical results.', 'Phantom study of a novel stereotactic prostate biopsy system integrating preinterventional magnetic resonance imaging and live ultrasonography fusion.', 'Magnetic resonance imaging-targeted, 3D transrectal ultrasound-guided fusion biopsy for prostate cancer: Quantifying the impact of needle delivery error on diagnosis.', 'Conventional transrectal ultrasound guided biopsy.

However, it is still unknown how YB-1 affects cancer biology, especially its correlations with the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. Therefore, we aimed to examine the interaction between YB-1 and the MAPK pathway in prostate cancer.  Experimental design:   Quantitative real-time PCR, Western blotting, and co-immunoprecipitation assay were conducted in prostate cancer cells. YB-1, phosphorylated YB-1 (p-YB-1), and ERK2 protein expressions in 165 clinical specimens of prostate cancer were investigated by immunohistochemistry. YB-1, p-YB-1, and ERK2 nuclear expressions were compared with clinicopathologic characteristics and patient prognoses.  Results:   EGF upregulated p-YB-1, whereas MEK inhibitor (U0126, PD98059) decreased p-YB-1. Inversely, silencing of YB-1 using siRNA decreased the expression of ERK2 and phosphorylated MEK, ERK1/2, and RSK. Furthermore, YB-1 interacted with ERK2 and Raf-1 and regulated their expressions, through the proteasomal pathway. Immunohistochemical staining showed a significant correlation among the nuclear expressions of YB-1, p-YB-1, and ERK2. The Cox proportional hazards model revealed that high ERK2 expression was an independent prognostic factor [HR, 7.947; 95% confidence interval (CI), 3.527-20.508; P<0.0001].  Conclusion:   We revealed the functional relationship between YB-1 and MAPK signaling and its biochemical relevance to the progression of prostate cancer. In addition, ERK2 expression was an independent prognostic factor.

Until now, the mechanism and predictive marker for chemoresistance are poorly understood.  Experimental design:   Immortalized normal prostate and cancer cell lines stably manipulated with different DAB2IP expression levels were used and treated with chemotherapeutic drugs commonly used in prostate cancer therapy. Cell proliferation was measured using MTT assay; Western blot, quantitative PCR, and luciferase reporter assays were used to analyze Clusterin gene regulation by DAB2IP. Immunohistochemical analysis was conducted for evaluating DAB2IP, Clusterin and Egr-1 expression in human prostate cancer tissue.  Results:   DAB2IP Knockdown (KD) cells exhibited resistance to several chemotherapeutic drugs, whereas increased DAB2IP in C4-2 cells restored the drug sensitivity. Parallel, DAB2IP KD cells exhibited higher expression of Clusterin, an antiapoptotic factor, whereas elevated DAB2IP in C4-2 cells decreased Clusterin expression. Functionally, knocking down Clusterin by short-hairpin RNA or antisense oligonucleotide OGX-011 decreased drug resistance, whereas overexpressing Clusterin in C4-2 D2 enhanced drug resistance. Mechanistically, DAB2IP blocked the cross-talk between Wnt/β-catenin and IGF-I signaling, leading to the suppression of Egr-1 that is responsible for Clusterin expression. A similar result was observed in the prostate of DAB2IP knockout animals. In addition, we observed a significantly inverse correlation between DAB2IP and Egr-1 or Clusterin expression from clinical tissue microarray.  Conclusions:   This study unveils a new regulation of the Egr-1/Clusterin signaling network by DAB2IP. Loss of DAB2IP expression in CRPC cells signifies their chemoresistance.

To assess the impact of these changes on acute urinary retention (AUR) and dosimetric outcome.  Methods:   We analyzed 149 hormone-naïve patients. Measurements of the prostate volume were done using three-dimensional transrectal ultrasound (3D-TRUS) in the operating room before insertion of any needle (V1), after the insertion of 2 fixation needles with a harpoon (V2) and upon completion of the implant (V3). The quality of the implant was analyzed with the D90 (minimum dose in Grays received by 90% of the prostate volume) at day 30.  Results:   Mean baseline prostate volume (V1) was 37.4 ± 9.6 cc. A volume increase of >5% was seen in 51% between V1-V2 (mean = 2.5 cc, p < 0.01), in 42% between V2-V3 (mean = 1.9 cc, p < 0.01) and in 71% between V1-V3 (mean = 4.5 cc, p < 0.01). Pvol changes caused by insertion of the fixation needles were not statistically different than those caused by the implant itself (p = 0.23).In multivariate linear regression analysis, baseline Pvol is predictive of Pvol changes between V2 and V1 and V3 and V1 but not between V3 and V2. The extent of prostate swelling had an influence on D90. An increase of 10% in prostate volume between V1 and V2 results in an increase of D90 at Day 30 by 11.7%. Baseline Pvol (V1) was the only predictor of the duration of urinary retention in both univariate and multivariate (p = 0.04) regression analysis.

Increased expression of MAGE-A11 enhances androgen receptor transcriptional activity and promotes prostate cancer cell growth. Further investigation into the mechanisms of MAGE-A11 function in prostate cancer demonstrated interactions with the retinoblastoma-related protein p107 and Rb tumor suppressor but no interaction with p130 of the Rb family. MAGE-A11 interaction with p107 was associated with transcriptional repression in cells with low MAGE-A11 and transcriptional activation in cells with higher MAGE-A11. Selective interaction of MAGE-A11 with retinoblastoma family members suggested the regulation of E2F transcription factors. MAGE-A11 stabilized p107 by inhibition of ubiquitination and linked p107 to hypophosphorylated E2F1 in association with the stabilization and activation of E2F1. The androgen receptor and MAGE-A11 modulated endogenous expression of the E2F1-regulated cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27(Kip1). The ability of MAGE-A11 to increase E2F1 transcriptional activity was similar to the activity of adenovirus early oncoprotein E1A and depended on MAGE-A11 interactions with p107 and p300. The immunoreactivity of p107 and MAGE-A11 was greater in advanced prostate cancer than in benign prostate, and knockdown with small inhibitory RNA showed that p107 is a transcriptional activator in prostate cancer cells.

Recent evidence suggests that it may possess antitumoral properties. The aim of this study was to test the association between metformin use and risk of prostate cancer and its grade among men with diabetes.  Methods:   Data were obtained from population-based health-care administrative databases in Ontario, Canada. This retrospective cohort study used a nested case-control approach to examine the relationship between metformin exposure and the risk of prostate cancer within a cohort of incident diabetic men aged 66 years or older. We conducted four case-control analyses, defining case subjects as 1) any prostate cancer, 2) high-grade, 3) low-grade, and 4) biopsy-diagnosed. In each analysis, case subjects were matched to five control subjects on age and cohort entry date. Metformin exposure was determined based on prescriptions before cancer diagnosis, and adjusted odds ratios (aOR) were estimated using conditional logistic regression. All statistical tests were two-sided.  Results:   Within our cohort of 119 315 men with diabetes, there were 5306 case subjects with prostate cancer and 26 530 matched control subjects. Within the cancer case subjects, 1104 had high- grade cancer, 1719 had low-grade cancer, and 3524 had biopsy-diagnosed cancer. There was no association between metformin use and risk of any prostate cancer (aOR = 1.03, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.96 to 1.1), high-grade cancer (aOR = 1.13, 95% CI = 0.96 to 1.32), low-grade cancer (aOR = 0.94, 95% CI = 0.82 to 1.06), or biopsy-diagnosed cancer (aOR = 0.98, 95% CI = 0.84 to 1.02).

Since 2000, the National Prostate Cancer Register (NPCR) of Sweden has led an effort to decrease national rates of inappropriate prostate cancer imaging by disseminating utilization data along with the latest imaging guidelines to urologists in Sweden. We sought to determine the temporal and regional effects of this effort on prostate cancer imaging rates.  Methods:   We performed a retrospective cohort study among men diagnosed with prostate cancer from the NPCR from 1998 to 2009 (n = 99 879). We analyzed imaging use over time stratified by clinical risk category (low, intermediate, high) and geographic region. Generalized linear models with a logit link were used to test for time trend.  Results:   Thirty-six percent of men underwent imaging within 6 months of prostate cancer diagnosis. Overall, imaging use decreased over time, particularly in the low-risk category, among whom the imaging rate decreased from 45% to 3% (P < .001), but also in the high-risk category, among whom the rate decreased from 63% to 47% (P < .001). Despite substantial regional variation, all regions experienced clinically and statistically (P < .001) significant decreases in prostate cancer imaging.  Conclusions:   A Swedish effort to provide data on prostate cancer imaging use and imaging guidelines to clinicians was associated with a reduction in inappropriate imaging over a 10-year period, as well as slightly decreased appropriate imaging in high-risk patients.

Toward developing better model systems for studying human prostate carcinogenesis, we and others have taken advantage of the unique pro-prostatic inductive potential of embryonic rodent prostate stroma, termed urogenital sinus mesenchyme (UGSM). When recombined with certain pluripotent cell populations such as embryonic stem cells, UGSM induces the formation of normal human prostate epithelia in a testosterone-dependent manner. Such a human model system can be used to investigate and experimentally test the ability of candidate prostate cancer susceptibility genes at an accelerated pace compared to typical rodent transgenic studies. Since Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) can be genetically modified in culture using inducible gene expression or siRNA knock-down vectors prior to tissue recombination, such a model facilitates testing the functional consequences of genes, or combinations of genes, which are thought to promote or prevent carcinogenesis. The technique of isolating pure populations of UGSM cells, however, is challenging and learning often requires someone with previous expertise to personally teach. Moreover, inoculation of cell mixtures under the renal capsule of an immunocompromised host can be technically challenging. Here we outline and illustrate proper isolation of UGSM from rodent embryos and renal capsule implantation of tissue mixtures to form human prostate epithelium. Such an approach, at its current stage, requires in vivo xenografting of embryonic stem cells; future applications could potentially include in vitro gland formation or the use of induced pluripotent stem cell populations (iPSCs).""","""['Yi Cai', 'Steven Kregel', 'Donald J Vander Griend']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Vis Exp""","""['Isolation and characterization of an immortalized mouse urogenital sinus mesenchyme cell line.', 'Permissive and instructive induction of adult rodent prostatic epithelium by heterotypic urogenital sinus mesenchyme.', 'In vivo regeneration of murine prostate from dissociated cell populations of postnatal epithelia and urogenital sinus mesenchyme.', 'Prostate stromal and urogenital sinus mesenchymal cell lines for investigations of stromal-epithelial interactions.', 'Development of the human prostate.', 'Propagation of human prostate tissue from induced pluripotent stem cells.', 'Genome-wide analysis of androgen receptor binding and transcriptomic analysis in mesenchymal subsets during prostate development.', 'Contribution of Caudal Müllerian Duct Mesenchyme to Prostate Development.', 'Tbx18 Regulates the Differentiation of Periductal Smooth Muscle Stroma and the Maintenance of Epithelial Integrity in the Prostate.']"""

However, the molecular mechanism by which AR-V7 is generated remains unclear. In this manuscript, we demonstrated that RNA splicing of AR-V7 in response to ADT was closely associated with AR gene transcription initiation and elongation rates. Enhanced AR gene transcription by ADT provides a prerequisite condition that further increases the interactions between AR pre-mRNA and splicing factors. Under ADT conditions, recruitment of several RNA splicing factors to the 3' splicing site for AR-V7 was increased. We identified two RNA splicing enhancers and their binding proteins (U2AF65 and ASF/SF2) that had critical roles in splicing AR pre-mRNA into AR-V7.

Recent studies have revealed downregulation or hemizygous loss of Dicer in many tumor models and demonstrated that suppressing Dicer activity enhances tumorigenic activities of lung and breast cancer cells, which support Dicer as a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor in these cancer models. Surprisingly, we found that knocking down Dicer expression suppresses the growth and tumorigenic capacity of human prostate cancer cell lines, but enhances migratory capacities of some prostate cancer cell lines. Dicer is upregulated in human prostate cancer specimens, but lower Dicer expression portends a shorter time to recurrence. Complete ablation of Dicer activity in a Pten null mouse model for prostate cancer significantly halts tumor growth and progression, demonstrating that microRNAs have a critical role in maintaining cancer cell fitness. In comparison, hemizygous loss of Dicer in the same model also reduces primary tumor burden, but induces a more locally invasive phenotype and causes seminal vesicle obstruction at high penetrance. Disrupting Dicer activity leads to an increase in apoptosis and senescence in these models, presumably through upregulation of P16/INK4a and P27/Kip1.

Androgen-dependent prostate cancer is reliant on the function of AR for growth and progression. Most castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) remains dependent on AR signaling for survival and growth. Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is essential for both androgen-dependent and castration-resistant growth of prostate cancer cells. During androgen-dependent growth of prostate cells, androgen-AR signaling leads to the accumulation of rRNA. However, the mechanism by which AR regulates rRNA transcription is unknown. Here, investigation revealed that angiogenin (ANG), a member of the secreted ribonuclease superfamily, is upregulated in prostate cancer and mediates androgen-stimulated rRNA transcription in prostate cancer cells. Upon androgen stimulation, ANG undergoes nuclear translocation in androgen-dependent prostate cancer cells, where it binds to the rDNA promoter and stimulates rRNA transcription. ANG antagonists inhibit androgen-induced rRNA transcription and cell proliferation in androgen-dependent prostate cancer cells. Interestingly, ANG also mediates androgen-independent rRNA transcription through a mechanism that involves its constitutive nuclear translocation in androgen-insensitive prostate cancer cells, resulting in a constant rRNA overproduction and thereby stimulating cell proliferation. Critically, ANG overexpression in androgen-dependent prostate cancer cells enables castration-resistant growth of otherwise androgen-dependent cells. Thus, ANG-stimulated rRNA transcription is not only an essential component for androgen-dependent growth of prostate cancer but also contributes to the transition of prostate cancer from androgen-dependent to castration-resistant growth status.  Implications:   The ability of angiogenin to regulate rRNA transcription and prostate cancer growth makes it a viable target for therapy.""","""['Shuping Li', 'Miaofen G Hu', 'Yeqing Sun', 'Norie Yoshioka', 'Soichiro Ibaragi', 'Jinghao Sheng', 'Guangjie Sun', 'Koji Kishimoto', 'Guo-Fu Hu']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Res""","""['NDRG2 acts as a negative regulator downstream of androgen receptor and inhibits the growth of androgen-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Orphan nuclear receptor TLX contributes to androgen insensitivity in castration-resistant prostate cancer via its repression of androgen receptor transcription.', 'Restoration of the cellular secretory milieu overrides androgen dependence of in\xa0vivo generated castration resistant prostate cancer cells overexpressing the androgen receptor.', 'Androgen receptor-dependent and -independent mechanisms driving prostate cancer progression: Opportunities for therapeutic targeting from multiple angles.', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Prostate-specific antigen reduction after capecitabine plus oxaliplatin chemotherapy: A case report.', 'Ribonuclease 4 is associated with aggressiveness and progression of prostate cancer.', 'Angiogenin and plexin-B2 axis promotes glioblastoma progression by enhancing invasion, vascular association, proliferation and survival.', 'Angiogenin negatively regulates the expression of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and inhibits bFGF promoter activity.', 'Chemosensitization of prostate cancer stem cells in mice by angiogenin and plexin-B2 inhibitors.']"""

We describe the development, validation and application of a stable isotope dilution liquid chromatography electrospray ionization selected reaction monitoring mass spectrometry (SID-LC/ESI/SRM/MS) method for quantification of serum keto-androgens and their sulfate and glucuronide conjugates using Girard-T oxime derivatives. The method is robust down to 0.2-4pg on column, depending on the androgen metabolite quantified, and can also quantify dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) in only 1μL of serum. The clinical utility of this method was demonstrated by analyzing serum androgens from patients enrolled in a clinical trial assessing combinations of pharmacological agents to maximally suppress gonadal and adrenal androgens (Targeted Androgen Pathway Suppression, TAPS clinical trial). The method was validated by correlating the results obtained with a hydroxylamine derivatization procedure coupled with tandem mass spectrometry using selected reaction monitoring that was conducted in an independent laboratory.""","""['Daniel Tamae', 'Michael Byrns', 'Brett Marck', 'Elahe A Mostaghel', 'Peter S Nelson', 'Paul Lange', 'Daniel Lin', 'Mary-Ellen Taplin', 'Steven Balk', 'William Ellis', 'Larry True', 'Robert Vessella', 'Bruce Montgomery', 'Ian A Blair', 'Trevor M Penning']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Steroid Biochem Mol Biol""","""['Simultaneous quantitation of nine hydroxy-androgens and their conjugates in human serum by stable isotope dilution liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry.', 'Androgen glucuronides analysis by liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry: could it raise new perspectives in the diagnostic field of hormone-dependent malignancies?', 'The DHEA-sulfate depot following P450c17 inhibition supports the case for AKR1C3 inhibition in high risk localized and advanced castration resistant prostate cancer.', 'Validation of highly sensitive simultaneous targeted and untargeted analysis of keto-steroids by Girard P derivatization and stable isotope dilution-liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry.', 'Testicular vs adrenal sources of hydroxy-androgens in prostate cancer.', 'Androgen Metabolism and Response in Prostate Cancer Anti-Androgen Therapy Resistance.', 'Conversion of Classical and 11-Oxygenated Androgens by Insulin-Induced AKR1C3 in a Model of Human PCOS Adipocytes.', 'A sensitive approach for simultaneous quantification of carbonyl and hydroxyl steroids using 96-well SPE plates based on stable isotope coded-derivatization-UPLC-MRM: method development and application.', 'Derivatization with 2-hydrazino-1-methylpyridine enhances sensitivity of analysis of 5α-dihydrotestosterone in human plasma by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry.', 'Determination of Intraprostatic and Intratesticular Androgens.']"""

In the context of prostate cancer histopathology, gland morphology is an integral component of the Gleason grading system which enables discrimination between low and high grade disease. However, clinicians are often unable to distinguish between subtle differences in object morphology, as evidenced by high inter-observer variability in Gleason grading. Boundary-based morphologic descriptors, such as the variance in the distance from points on the boundary of an object to its center, may not have the requisite discriminability to separate objects with subtle shape differences. In this paper, we present a set of novel explicit shape descriptors (ESDs) which are capable of distinguishing subtle shape differences between prostate glands of intermediate Gleason grades (grades 3 and 4) on prostate cancer histopathology. Calculation of ESDs involves: (1) representing object morphology using an explicit shape model (e.g. medial axis); (2) aligning the shape models via a non-rigid registration scheme with a diffeomorphic constraint and quantifying shape model dissimilarity; and (3) applying a non-linear dimensionality reduction scheme (e.g. Graph Embedding) to learn a low dimensional projection encoding the shape differences between objects. ESDs are hence the principal eigenvectors in the reduced embedding space. In this work we demonstrate that ESDs in conjunction with a Support Vector Machine classifier are able to correctly distinguish between 888 prostate glands corresponding to different Gleason grades (benign, grade 3, or grade 4) of prostate cancer from 58 needle biopsy specimens with a maximum accuracy of 0.89 and corresponding area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.78.""","""['Rachel Sparks', 'Anant Madabhushi']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Med Image Anal""","""['Novel morphometric based classification via diffeomorphic based shape representation using manifold learning.', 'Selective invocation of shape priors for deformable segmentation and morphologic classification of prostate cancer tissue microarrays.', 'Statistical Shape Model for Manifold Regularization: Gleason grading of prostate histology.', 'The 2014 International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) Consensus Conference on Gleason Grading of Prostatic Carcinoma: Definition of Grading Patterns and Proposal for a New Grading System.', 'Computer-Aided Prostate Cancer Diagnosis From Digitized Histopathology: A Review on Texture-Based Systems.', 'Genetic architecture of variation in Arabidopsis thaliana rosettes.', 'Computer extracted gland features from H&E predicts prostate cancer recurrence comparably to a genomic companion diagnostic test: a large multi-site study.', ""Deep Learning for Whole-Slide Tissue Histopathology Classification: A Comparative Study in the Identification of Dysplastic and Non-Dysplastic Barrett's Esophagus."", 'Artificial intelligence at the intersection of pathology and radiology in prostate cancer.', 'Stable and discriminating features are predictive of cancer presence and Gleason grade in radical prostatectomy specimens: a multi-site study.']"""

TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion appears to be a highly specific alteration in prostatic carcinoma that is frequently shared by small cell carcinoma. In adenocarcinoma, immunohistochemistry for the ERG protein product has been reported to correlate well with the presence of the gene fusion, although in prostatic small cell carcinoma, this relationship is not completely understood. We evaluated 54 cases of small cell carcinoma of the prostate and compared TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion status by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to immunohistochemical staining with antibody to ERG. Of 54 cases of prostatic small cell carcinoma, 26 (48%) were positive for TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion by FISH and 12 (22%) showed overexpression of ERG protein by immunohistochemistry. Of the 26 cases positive by FISH, 11 were also positive for ERG protein by immunohistochemistry. One tumor was positive by immunohistochemistry but negative by FISH. Urinary bladder small cell carcinoma (n = 25) showed negative results by both methods; however, 2 of 14 small cell carcinomas of other organs (lung, head, and neck) showed positive immunohistochemistry but negative FISH. Positive staining for ERG by immunohistochemistry is present in a subset of prostatic small cell carcinomas and correlates with the presence of TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion.

Objective:   To develop a model that allows quantification of the likelihood that a pathologically node-negative patient is indeed free of nodal metastasis.  Design, setting, and participants:   Data from patients treated with RP and pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND; n=7135) for PCa between 2000 and 2011 were analyzed. For external validation, we used data from patients (n=4209) who underwent an anatomically defined extended PLND.  Intervention:   RP and PLND.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   We developed a novel pathologic (postoperative) nodal staging score (pNSS) that represents the probability that a patient is correctly staged as node negative based on the number of examined nodes and the patient's characteristics.  Results and limitations:   In the development and validation cohorts, the probability of missing a positive node decreases with an increasing number of nodes examined. Whereas in pT2 patients, a 90% pNSS was achieved with one single examined node in both the development and validation cohort, a similar level of nodal staging accuracy was achieved in pT3a patients by examining five and nine nodes, respectively. The pT3b/T4 patients achieved a pNSS of 80% and 70% when 17 and 20 nodes in the development and validation cohort were examined, respectively. This study is limited by its retrospective design and multicenter nature. The number of nodes removed was not directly correlated with the extent/template of PLND.  Conclusions:   Every patient needs PLND for accurate nodal staging. However, a one-size-fits-all approach is too inaccurate.

Due to the increased life expectancy and more sensitive diagnostic techniques in the Western world, prostate cancer is diagnosed more frequently and with rapidly increasing incidence and prevalence rates. However, age above 65 or 70 years has been an exclusion criterion in clinical trials for decades and the knowledge about chemotherapy tolerance in elderly is limited.  Methods:   We performed a retrospective analysis of data acquired from the recently published Netherlands Prostate Study (NePro) to evaluate the influence of advanced age on docetaxel therapy in elderly men (>70 years) with castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and bone metastases. Statistical analyses were performed stratified for age into four categories: <70 (n=315), 70-74 (n=150), 75-79 (n=85), and ≥80 years old (n=18).  Results:   We analysed 568 patients (median age 68.1 years, range 46-89 years, 44.5% aged ≥70 years). There was no relation between dosage and age (p=0.60). We found no significant differences between the number of dose reductions, time to progression (TTP), overall survival, chemotherapy tolerance and toxicity up to the age of 80 years. However, when compared to younger men, men aged 80 years or above more frequently experienced grade 3/4 toxicity and were five times less likely to complete the first three treatment cycles at the intended dose (Odds ratio (OR) 5.34, p=0.0052) and showed decreased overall survival (15.3 months versus 24.5 months in <80 years group, p=0.020).

Methods and materials:   Real-time intrafraction prostate motion was observed using Calypso 4-dimensional (4D) nonradioactive electromagnetic tracking system. We report the results from a total of 1024 fractions from 31 prostate cancer patients. First, the correlation of prostate motion in right/left (RL), anteroposterior (AP), and superoinferior (SI) direction were determined using Pearson's correlation of coefficient. Then the spatial distribution of prostate motion was analyzed for individual fraction, individual patient including all fractions, and all patients including all fractions. The displacement in RL, AP, SI, oblique, or total direction is fitted into a Gaussian distribution, and a Lilliefors test was used to evaluate the validity of the hypothesis that the displacement is normally distributed.  Results:   There is high correlation in AP/SI direction (61% of fractions with medium or strong correlation). This is consistent with the longitudinal oblique motion of the prostate, and likely the effect from respiration on an organ confined within the genitourinary diaphragm with the rectum sitting posteriorly and bladder sitting superiorly. In all directions, the non-Gaussian distribution is more common for individual fraction, individual patient including all fractions, and all patients including all fractions. The spatial distribution of prostate motion shows an elongated shape in oblique direction, indicating a higher range of motion in the AP and SI directions.  Conclusions:   Our results showed that the prostate motion is highly correlated in AP and SI direction, indicating an oblique motion preference. In addition, the spatial distribution of prostate motion is elongated in an oblique direction, indicating that the organ motion dosimetric modeling using Gaussian kernel may need to be modified to account for the particular organ motion character of prostate.""","""['Yuting Lin', 'Tian Liu', 'Wells Yang', 'Xiaofeng Yang', 'Mohammad K Khan']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Respiratory-induced prostate motion using wavelet decomposition of the real-time electromagnetic tracking signal.', 'Determination of Intrafraction Prostate Motion During External Beam Radiation Therapy With a\xa0Transperineal 4-Dimensional Ultrasound Real-Time Tracking System.', 'An endorectal balloon reduces intrafraction prostate motion during radiotherapy.', 'Assessment of planning target volume margins for intensity-modulated radiotherapy of the prostate gland: role of daily inter- and intrafraction motion.', 'Determination of action thresholds for electromagnetic tracking system-guided hypofractionated prostate radiotherapy using volumetric modulated arc therapy.', 'Urethra Sparing With Target Motion Mitigation in Dose-Escalated Extreme Hypofractionated Prostate Cancer Radiotherapy: 7-Year Results From a Phase II Study.', 'The effect of prostate motion during hypofractionated radiotherapy can be reduced by using flattening filter free beams.', 'Analysis of intra-fraction prostate motion and derivation of duration-dependent margins for radiotherapy using real-time 4D ultrasound.', 'Adaptive Imaging Versus Periodic Surveillance for Intrafraction Motion Management During Prostate Cancer Radiotherapy.', 'Respiratory-induced prostate motion using wavelet decomposition of the real-time electromagnetic tracking signal.']"""

Methods and materials:   Three patient cohorts treated using a commercially available image guided radiation therapy (IGRT) system that uses 2-dimensional to 3-dimensional (2D-3D) image registration were retrospectively analyzed: a group of 100 cranial radiation therapy patients, a group of 100 prostate cancer patients, and a group of 83 patients treated for spinal lesions. The setup images were acquired using fixed in-room kilovoltage imaging systems. In the prostate and cranial patient groups, localizations using image registration were performed between computed tomography (CT) simulation images from radiation therapy planning and setup x-ray images corresponding both to the same patient and to different patients. For the spinal patients, localizations were performed to the correct vertebral body, and to an adjacent vertebral body, using planning CTs and setup x-ray images from the same patient. An image similarity measure used by the IGRT system image registration algorithm was extracted from the IGRT system log files and evaluated as a discriminant for error detection.  Results:   A threshold value of the similarity measure could be chosen to separate correct and incorrect patient matches and correct and incorrect vertebral body localizations with excellent accuracy for these patient cohorts.

Methods:   From November 2003 to July 2009, 164 patients with locally advanced prostate carcinoma were sequentially enrolled and treated with 34 or 36 Gy in 4 fractions and 31.5 Gy in 3 fractions of (192)Ir HDR-BT alone. The median follow-up time was 71 months. Gland size was not considered in the selection criteria for this study. Estimates of freedom from biochemical relapse (FFbR) and late morbidity, stratified by median clinical target volume (CTV), were obtained, and differences were compared.  Results:   The median CTV volume was 60 cc (range, 15-208 cc). Dose-volume parameters D90 and V100 (ie, minimum dose to 90% of the prostate volume and volume receiving 100% of the prescribed isodose) achieved in patients with glands ≥60 cc were not significantly different from those with glands <60 cc (P≥.2). Nonetheless, biochemical control in patients with larger CTV was significantly higher (91% vs 78% at 6 years; P=.004). In univariate and multivariate analysis, CTV was a significant predictor for risk of biochemical relapse. This was not at the expense of an increase in either moderate (P=.6) or severe (P=.3) late genitourinary toxicity. The use of hormonal therapy was 17% lower in the large gland group (P=.01).  Conclusions:   Prostate gland size does not affect dosimetric parameters in HDR-BT assessed by D90 and V100. In patients with larger glands, a significantly higher biochemical control of disease was observed, with no difference in late toxicity. This improvement cannot be attributed to differences in dosimetry.

This study evaluates the association between literacy, compliance with screening, and biopsy findings in a large Brazilian screening study.  Materials and methods:   We analyzed 17,571 men screened for PCa with digital rectal examination (DRE) and total and free prostate-specific antigen (PSA) from January 2004 to December 2007. Of those, 17,558 men had information regarding literate status. Full urological evaluation in a specialized cancer center was recommended in the case of: a) suspicious DRE, b) PSA > 4.0 ng/mL, or c) PSA 2.5-3.9 ng/mL and free/total PSA (f/tPSA) ratio 15%.

They also act as cell adhesion molecules that are responsible for the maintenance of the normal epithelial phenotype. Some studies have reported a correlation between carcinogenesis and changes in integrin expression, especially β1 integrin, however its role in prostate cancer (PC) is unclear. The aim of our study was to evaluate the expression of β1 integrin in localized PC and to correlate the pattern of expression with recurrence after surgical treatment. Methods For this case-control study, we retrospectively selected surgical specimens from 111 patients with localized PC who underwent radical prostatectomy. Recurrence was defined as a PSA level exceeding 0.2 ng/mL after surgery, and the median follow-up was 123 months. Integrin expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in a tissue microarray containing two samples from each tumor. We employed a semiquantitative analysis and considered a case as positive when the expression was strong and diffusely present.  Results:   There was a loss of 11 cases during the tissue micro array assembling. β1 expression was positive in 79 of the 100 evaluated cases (79%). The univariate and multivariate analyses showed that the negative expression of β1 integrin was associated with biochemical recurrence (p = 0.047) and time to recurrence after radical prostatectomy (p = 0.023).

Enzalutamide is a second-generation nonsteroidal antiandrogen that has recently been approved for the same indication.  Objective:   This is the first study to evaluate the effectiveness of enzalutamide after failure of abiraterone.  Design, setting, and participants:   Thirty-five patients were identified as having received sequential therapy with abiraterone followed by enzalutamide. All patients had undergone prior docetaxel chemotherapy, and no patient had received ketoconazole.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Posttreatment changes in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) were used to determine the activity of enzalutamide in patients who had received prior abiraterone.  Results and limitations:   The median duration of abiraterone treatment was 9.0 mo (range: 2.0-19.0 mo). Of the 35 patients, 16 (45.7%) achieved a >50% decline in PSA, and 14 (40%) had a rising PSA as the best response. The median duration of subsequent enzalutamide treatment was 4.9 mo (Kaplan-Meier estimate; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.4-7.4). Seven of 16 CRPC patients who were initially abiraterone-sensitive (43.8%) and 3 of 19 CRPC patients who were initially abiraterone-insensitive (15.8%) showed a >50% PSA decline while taking enzalutamide. Of the 35 patients, 17 (48.6%) were primarily enzalutamide-resistant and showed a rising PSA as the best response. Median time to progression was 4.0 mo (95% CI, 2.0-6.0) for 18 of 35 patients with at least one declining PSA value while taking enzalutamide (51.4%). Of the 17 patients who were assessable radiologically, only 1 (2.9%) attained a confirmed partial response. Small sample size was the major limitation.  Conclusions:   Enzalutamide treatment achieved only a modest response rate in patients progressing after abiraterone.

However, the molecular mechanisms that contribute to prostatic inflammation remain largely unexplored. Recent studies have indicated that the IFN-inducible AIM2 protein is a cytosolic DNA sensor in macrophages and keratinocytes. Upon sensing DNA, AIM2 recruits the adaptor ASC and pro-CASP1 to assemble the AIM2 inflammasome. Activation of the AIM2 inflammasome cleaves pro-interleukin (IL)-1β and pro-IL-18 and promotes the secretion of IL-1β and IL-18 proinflammatory cytokines. Given that human prostatic infections are associated with chronic inflammation, the development of BPH is associated with an accumulation of senescent cells with a proinflammatory phenotype, and the development of prostate cancer is associated with the loss of IFN signaling, the role of AIM2 in mediating the formation of prostatic diseases was investigated. It was determined that IFNs (α, β, or γ) induced AIM2 expression in human prostate epithelial cells and cytosolic DNA activated the AIM2 inflammasome. Steady-state levels of the AIM2 mRNA were higher in BPH than in normal prostate tissue. However, the levels of AIM2 mRNA were significantly lower in clinical tumor specimens. Accordingly, constitutive levels of AIM2 mRNA and protein were lower in a subset of prostate cancer cells as compared with BPH cells. Further, the cytosolic DNA activated the AIM2 inflammasome in the androgen receptor-negative PC3 prostate cancer cell line, suggesting that AIM2-mediated events are independent of androgen receptor status.  Implications:   The AIM2 inflammasome has a fundamental role in the generation of human prostatic diseases.""","""['Larissa Ponomareva', 'Hongzhu Liu', 'Xin Duan', 'Eric Dickerson', 'Hui Shen', 'Ravichandran Panchanathan', 'Divaker Choubey']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Res""","""['Human Prostate Epithelial Cells Activate the AIM2 Inflammasome upon Cellular Senescence: Role of POP3 Protein in Aging-Related Prostatic Inflammation.', 'HPV16 activates the AIM2 inflammasome in keratinocytes.', 'Expression analysis of thrombospondin 2 in prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'Differentiation pathways and histogenetic aspects of normal and abnormal prostatic growth: a stem cell model.', ""Type I interferon (IFN)-inducible Absent in Melanoma 2 proteins in neuroinflammation: implications for Alzheimer's disease."", 'Macrophage IL-1β contributes to tumorigenesis through paracrine AIM2 inflammasome activation in the tumor microenvironment.', 'Relationship between pyroptosis-mediated inflammation and the pathogenesis of prostate disease.', 'Pyroptosis in urinary malignancies: a literature review.', 'Construction of Pyroptosis-Related Prognostic and Immune Infiltration Signature in Bladder Cancer.', 'Cell-Free DNA in the Pathogenesis and Therapy of Non-Infectious Inflammations and Tumors.']"""

Gleason score upgrading (GSU) between biopsy and surgical pathology specimens has been reported as high as 50 % and presents a challenge in counseling low-risk patients. While recent studies have investigated predictors of GSU, populations in these studies have been largely Caucasian. We report our analysis of predictors of GSU in a large urban African-American population.  Methods:   A total of 959 patients with D'Amico low-risk prostate cancer underwent radical prostatectomy at Georgetown University or Washington Hospital Center between January 2005 and July 2012. Race, age, PSA, body mass index (BMI), cancer of the prostate risk assessment (CAPRA) score, and transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) biopsy characteristics (percent of biopsy cores showing adenocarcinoma, highest percent of biopsy core involved with cancer, and measured TRUS prostate volume) were analyzed with both univariate and multivariate analyses to identify significant predictors of GSU while controlling for clinical parameters.  Results:   Of the 959 cases, 288 (30.0 %) were upgraded on final pathologic specimen with approximately 38 % (133/355) of African-American patients experiencing GSU. BMI (P = 0.02), percent positive biopsy cores (P < 0.01) and percent of core involved with cancer (P < 0.01), increasing CAPRA score, and serum PSA were independent predictors of GSU on both uni- and multivariate regression analyses. African Americans had a 73 % increase in the incidence of GSU over other races.  Conclusion:   More than a quarter of low-risk prostate cancer patients were upgraded on final pathology in our series. Higher BMI, serum PSA, CAPRA score, percent of cores positive, and percent of cores involved were independent predictors of GSU. Individuals with those clinical parameters may harbor occult high-grade disease and should be carefully counseled on treatment decisions.""","""['Anup Vora', 'Tim Large', 'Jenny Aronica', 'Sherod Haynes', 'Andrew Harbin', 'Daniel Marchalik', 'Hanaa Nissim', 'John Lynch', 'Gaurav Bandi', 'Kevin McGeagh', 'Keith Kowalczyk', 'Reza Ghasemian', 'Krishnan Venkatesan', 'Mohan Verghese', 'Jonathan Hwang']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Int Urol Nephrol""","""['Analysis of risk factors for Gleason score upgrading after radical prostatectomy in a Chinese cohort.', 'Predictors for clinically relevant Gleason score upgrade in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy.', 'Biopsy core number represents one of foremost predictors of clinically significant gleason sum upgrading in patients with low-risk prostate cancer.', 'Pathology of premalignant lesions and carcinoma of the prostate in African-American men.', 'Is active surveillance a suitable option for African American men with prostate cancer?

However, the mechanism underlying this cellular response remains unclear. In the course of investigating the suppressive effect of the energy restriction-mimetic agent CG-5 on IGF-IR expression in prostate cancer cells, we identified a novel posttranscriptional mechanism by which the RNA-binding protein human antigen R (HuR) regulates IGF-IR expression through messenger RNA (mRNA) stabilization. Previously, we demonstrated that Sp1 and HuR proteins were concomitantly targeted for ubiquitin-dependent degradation by β-transducin repeat-containing protein in response to CG-5. Although this loss of Sp1 expression contributed to CG-5-mediated IGF-IR downregulation, enforced specific protein 1 (Sp1) expression could only partially protect cells from the drug effect. The small interfering RNA-mediated silencing of HuR suppressed IGF-IR expression by reducing mRNA stability, whereas ectopic HuR expression increased IGF-IR mRNA stability and protein expression and, when coexpressed with Sp1, blocked CG-5-mediated IGF-IR ablation. RNA pull-down and immunoprecipitation analyses indicated that HuR selectively bound to the distal region of the IGF-IR 3' untranslated region (UTR), whereas no interaction with the 5'UTR was noted. Evaluation of a series of truncated HuR mutants revealed that the RNA recognition motifs (RRM2 and RRM3) were involved in IGF-IR 3'UTR binding and the consequent increase in IGF-IR mRNA stability. Although these data contrast with a previous report that HuR acted as a translation repressor of IGF-IR mRNA through 5'UTR binding, our finding is consistent with the reported oncogenic role of HuR in conferring stability to target mRNAs encoding tumor-promoting proteins.""","""['Po-Chen Chu', 'Samuel K Kulp', 'Ching-Shih Chen']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Carcinogenesis""","""['Corrigendum.', 'Retraction: Insulin-like growth factor-I receptor is suppressed through transcriptional repression and mRNA destabilization by a novel energy restriction-mimetic agent.', ""The ELAV RNA-stability factor HuR binds the 5'-untranslated region of the human IGF-IR transcript and differentially represses cap-dependent and IRES-mediated translation."", 'Hu antigen R and tristetraprolin: counter-regulators of rat apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter by way of effects on messenger RNA stability.', 'Alterations in RNA-binding activities of IRES-regulatory proteins as a mechanism for physiological variability and pathological dysregulation of IGF-IR translational control in human breast tumor cells.', 'Mechanisms coordinating ELAV/Hu mRNA regulons.', 'Properties of the Regulatory RNA-Binding Protein HuR and its Role in Controlling miRNA Repression.', 'Post-transcriptional regulation of cytokine expression and signaling.', 'Cooperative Repression of Insulin-Like Growth Factor Type 2 Receptor Translation by MicroRNA 195 and RNA-Binding Protein CUGBP1.', 'Downregulation of HuR Inhibits the Progression of Esophageal Cancer through Interleukin-18.', 'Post-transcriptional regulation of cytokine and growth factor signaling in cancer.']"""

Cases were all Danish individuals with a histologically verified first-time diagnosis of malignant melanoma, breast, or prostate cancer during 2000-2009. For each case, we selected four cancer-free controls matched for age, sex, and year of first disulfiram prescription using risk set sampling. Similarly, for secondary analyses, we selected case-control populations for selected tobacco-related and alcohol-related cancer types, that is, cancers of the buccal cavity, liver, lung, and colorectal cancer. Disulfiram use 1 year before cancer diagnosis and the corresponding date for controls were disregarded. We estimated crude and adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for cancer associated with long-term (≥500 daily defined doses) versus one-time (one prescription) use of disulfiram. Among 53 856 disulfiram users, we identified 166, 644, and 464 cases, respectively, of melanoma, breast, or prostate cancer.

We assessed the efficacy and safety of radium-223 as compared with placebo, in addition to the best standard of care, in men with castration-resistant prostate cancer and bone metastases.  Methods:   In our phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, we randomly assigned 921 patients who had received, were not eligible to receive, or declined docetaxel, in a 2:1 ratio, to receive six injections of radium-223 (at a dose of 50 kBq per kilogram of body weight intravenously) or matching placebo; one injection was administered every 4 weeks. In addition, all patients received the best standard of care. The primary end point was overall survival. The main secondary efficacy end points included time to the first symptomatic skeletal event and various biochemical end points. A prespecified interim analysis, conducted when 314 deaths had occurred, assessed the effect of radium-223 versus placebo on survival. An updated analysis, when 528 deaths had occurred, was performed before crossover from placebo to radium-223.  Results:   At the interim analysis, which involved 809 patients, radium-223, as compared with placebo, significantly improved overall survival (median, 14.0 months vs. 11.2 months; hazard ratio, 0.70; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.55 to 0.88; two-sided P=0.002). The updated analysis involving 921 patients confirmed the radium-223 survival benefit (median, 14.9 months vs. 11.3 months; hazard ratio, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.58 to 0.83; P<0.001). Assessments of all main secondary efficacy end points also showed a benefit of radium-233 as compared with placebo. Radium-223 was associated with low myelosuppression rates and fewer adverse events.  Conclusions:   In this study, which was terminated for efficacy at the prespecified interim analysis, radium-223 improved overall survival.

An analysis of both In-room Times (IRT) and technical interventions of 5 years of treatments was performed, during which more than 1600 patients were treated for various indications, including liver (21%), lung (29%), intracranial (13%), head and neck (11%) and prostate (7%). Technical interventions were recorded along with the time of the failure, time to the intervention, and the complexity and duration of the repair. Analyses of Time Between Failures (TBF) and Service Disrupting TBF(disr) were performed. Treatment time data and variability per indication and following different system upgrades were evaluated. Large variations of IRTs were found between indications, but also large variations for each indication. The combination of the time reduction Tool (using Iris(r)) and Improved Stop Handling was of major impact to shortening of treatment times. The first implementation of the Iris collimator alone did not lead to significantly shorter IRTs for us except during prostate treatments. This was mostly due to the addition at the same time of larger rotational compensation for prostate treatments (58 instead of 1.58). Significant differences of duration between the first fraction and following fractions of a treatment, representing the necessity of defining imaging parameters and explanation to patients, were found for liver (12 min) and lung treatments using Xsight(r) Spine (5 min). Liver and lung treatments represent the longest IRT's and involve the largest variability's in IRT. The malfunction rate of the system followed a Weibull distribution with the shape and scale parameters of 0.8 and 39.7. Mean TBF(disr) was 68 work hours. 60 to 80% of the service disrupting interventions were resolved within 30-60 min, 5% required external intervention and 30% occurred in the morning. The presented results can be applied in the evaluation of the required machine time in order to implement robotic radiosurgery for different indications.

Data were gathered using individual semi-structured interviews, audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. Coherent stories were drawn from each transcript and analyzed using iterative and interpretive methods. van Manen's lifeworld existentials provided a framework for interpreting across the research text. Three notions emerged: Getting started, Having a routine and Being with music. Together they reveal what drew the participants to exercising regularly despite the challenges associated with their cancer and treatments. This study provides insights into the benefits of, and what it means for, older men with prostate cancer to regularly exercise individually.

Patient satisfaction may be relevant for improving African American men's use of regular care, thus improving the early detection of prostate cancer and attenuating racial disparities in prostate cancer outcomes.  Methods:   This descriptive correlation study examined relationships of individual characteristics that influence patient satisfaction using data from 505 African American men from North Carolina, who prospectively enrolled in the North Carolina-Louisiana Prostate Cancer Project from September 2004 to November 2007. Analyses consisted of univariate statistics, bivariate analysis, and multiple regression analysis.  Results:   The variables selected for the final model were: participation in religious activities, mistrust, racism, and perceived access to care. In this study, both cultural variables, mistrust (p=<.0001, F=95.58) and racism (p=<.002, F=5.59), were significantly negatively associated with patient satisfaction and accounted for the majority of the variability represented by individual characteristics.  Conclusion:   Mistrust and racism are cultural factors that are extremely important and have been negatively associated with patient satisfaction and decreased desires to utilize health care services for African American men.

We evaluated the ability of phi and PCA3 to identify prostate cancer (PCa) at initial prostate biopsy in men with total PSA range of 2-10 ng/ml. The performance of phi and PCA3 were evaluated in 300 patients undergoing first prostate biopsy. ROC curve analyses tested the accuracy (AUC) of phi and PCA3 in predicting PCa. Decision curve analyses (DCA) were used to compare the clinical benefit of the two biomarkers. We found that the AUC value of phi (0.77) was comparable to those of %p2PSA (0.76) and PCA3 (0.73) with no significant differences in pairwise comparison (%p2PSA vs phi p = 0.673, %p2PSA vs. PCA3 p = 0.417 and phi vs. PCA3 p = 0.247). These three biomarkers significantly outperformed fPSA (AUC = 0.60), % fPSA (AUC = 0.62) and p2PSA (AUC = 0.63). At DCA, phi and PCA3 exhibited a very close net benefit profile until the threshold probability of 25%, then phi index showed higher net benefit than PCA3. Multivariable analysis showed that the addition of phi and PCA3 to the base multivariable model (age, PSA, %fPSA, DRE, prostate volume) increased predictive accuracy, whereas no model improved single biomarker performance. Finally we showed that subjects with active surveillance (AS) compatible cancer had significantly lower phi and PCA3 values (p<0.001 and p = 0.01, respectively).

Long-term exercise is known to reduce serum levels of growth stimulating hormones. In contrast, the endocrine effects of acute endurance exercise include increased levels of mitogenic factors such as GH and IGF-1. It can be speculated that the elevation of serum growth factors may be detrimental to prostate cancer progression into malignancy. The incentive of the current study is to evaluate the effect of acute exercise serum on prostate cancer cell growth. We designed an exercise intervention where 10 male individuals performed 60 minutes of bicycle exercise at increasing intensity. Serum samples were obtained before (rest serum) and after completed exercise (exercise serum). The established prostate cancer cell line LNCaP was exposed to exercise or rest serum. Exercise serum from 9 out of 10 individuals had a growth inhibitory effect on LNCaP cells. Incubation with pooled exercise serum resulted in a 31% inhibition of LNCaP growth and pre-incubation before subcutaneous injection into SCID mice caused a delay in tumor formation. Serum analyses indicated two possible candidates for the effect; increased levels of IGFBP-1 and reduced levels of EGF.

However, relapse eventually occurs due to the development of resistance to docetaxel. To unravel the mechanism of acquired docetaxel resistance, we established docetaxel-resistant prostate cancer cells, TaxR, from castration-resistant C4-2B prostate cancer cells. The IC50 for docetaxel in TaxR cells was about 70-fold higher than parental C4-2B cells. Global gene expression analysis revealed alteration of expression of a total of 1,604 genes, with 52% being upregulated and 48% downregulated. ABCB1, which belongs to the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family, was identified among the top upregulated genes in TaxR cells. The role of ABCB1 in the development of docetaxel resistance was examined. Knockdown of ABCB1 expression by its specific shRNA or inhibitor resensitized docetaxel-resistant TaxR cells to docetaxel treatment by enhancing apoptotic cell death. Furthermore, we identified that apigenin, a natural product of the flavone family, inhibits ABCB1 expression and resensitizes docetaxel-resistant prostate cancer cells to docetaxel treatment. Collectively, these results suggest that overexpression of ABCB1 mediates acquired docetaxel resistance and targeting ABCB1 expression could be a potential approach to resensitize docetaxel-resistant prostate cancer cells to docetaxel treatment.""","""['Yezi Zhu', 'Chengfei Liu', 'Nagalakshmi Nadiminty', 'Wei Lou', 'Ramakumar Tummala', 'Christopher P Evans', 'Allen C Gao']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Ther""","""['Antiandrogens Inhibit ABCB1 Efflux and ATPase Activity and Reverse Docetaxel Resistance in Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'Activation of the ABCB1 Amplicon in Docetaxel- and Cabazitaxel-Resistant Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'MicroRNA-181a promotes docetaxel resistance in prostate cancer cells.', 'PIM1 kinase as a target in prostate cancer: roles in tumorigenesis, castration resistance, and docetaxel resistance.', 'Emerging targets to monitor and overcome docetaxel resistance in castration resistant prostate cancer (review).', 'Nicardipine is a putative EED inhibitor and has high selectivity and potency against chemoresistant prostate cancer in preclinical models.', 'Polysaccharides from Lentinus edodes prevent acquired drug resistance to docetaxel in prostate cancer cells by decreasing the TGF-β1 secretion of cancer-associated fibroblasts.', 'Bromocriptine monotherapy overcomes prostate cancer chemoresistance in preclinical models.', 'Comprehensive Evaluation of Multiple Approaches Targeting ABCB1 to Resensitize Docetaxel-Resistant Prostate Cancer Cell Lines.', 'New Guanidine Alkaloids Batzelladines O and P from the Marine Sponge Monanchora pulchra Induce Apoptosis and Autophagy in Prostate Cancer Cells.']"""

This study characterized the impact of comorbidity on treatment and survival in men with differing tumor risks.  Methods:   The researchers sampled 1482 men with nonmetastatic prostate cancer at 2 Veterans Affairs hospitals between 1998 and 2004, using multivariate probit regression to determine probabilities of aggressive treatment among men with differing Charlson comorbidity scores within D'Amico tumor risk strata. Using competing-risks regression, a comparison was made of 8-year cancer-specific mortality for men treated aggressively and nonaggressively among Charlson score-tumor risk pairs.  Results:   The study sample comprised 516 men (36%) with low-risk, 475 men (33%) with intermediate-risk, and 432 men (30%) with high-risk prostate cancer. Men with high-risk disease tended to have lower probability of aggressive treatment than other risk strata, regardless of comorbidity. Among men with Charlson scores 3+, probabilities of aggressive treatment did not increase with higher tumor risk (0.48, 0.61, 0.49 for low-, intermediate-, and high-risk disease, respectively). In competing-risks analysis, aggressive treatment was not associated with cancer-specific survival benefit in men with multiple comorbidities (Charlson scores of 2 or 3+) and low- and intermediate-risk disease, but there was a strong trend toward survival advantage in such men with high-risk disease.  Conclusions:   Aggressiveness of treatment is poorly matched with tumor risk in men with significant comorbidity.

However, the testosterone suppression associated with this therapy may lead to a hypogonadal condition that can have detrimental effects on renal function, thus raising the hypothesis that ADT-induced hypogonadism could potentially lead to acute kidney injury (AKI).  Objective:   To determine whether the use of ADT is associated with an increased risk of AKI in patients newly diagnosed with prostate cancer.  Design and setting:   A nested case-control analysis using medical information extracted from the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink linked to the Hospital Episodes Statistics database.  Participants:   Men newly diagnosed with nonmetastatic prostate cancer between January 1, 1997, and December 31, 2008, were selected and followed up until December 31, 2009. Cases were patients with incident AKI during follow-up who were randomly matched with up to 20 controls on age, calendar year of prostate cancer diagnosis, and duration of follow-up.  Main outcomes and measures:   Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs of AKI associated with the use of ADT. ADT was categorized into 1 of 6 mutually exclusive groups: gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists, oral antiandrogens, combined androgen blockade, bilateral orchiectomy, estrogens, and combination of the above. RESULTS A total of 10,250 patients met the study inclusion criteria. During a mean follow-up of 4.1 (SD, 2.9) years, 232 incident cases of AKI were identified (rate, 5.5/1000 person-years). Overall, current use of any ADT was associated with an increased risk of AKI when compared with never use (OR, 2.48 [95% CI, 1.61-3.82]), generating a rate difference of 4.43/1000 persons per year (95% CI, 1.54-7.33). This association was mainly driven by a combined androgen blockade consisting of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists with oral antiandrogens (OR, 4.50 [95% CI, 2.61-7.78]), estrogens (OR, 4.00 [95% CI, 1.06-15.03]), other combination therapies (OR, 4.04 [95% CI, 1.88-8.69]), and gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists (OR, 1.93 [95% CI, 1.20-3.10]).  Conclusions and relevance:   In a cohort of patients with newly diagnosed nonmetastatic prostate cancer, the use of ADT was significantly associated with an increased risk of AKI.

While biologic explanations are plausible, the association may in part arise from more frequent prostate cancer screening among those with a diabetes diagnosis. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the association between diabetes and prostate cancer screening.  Methods:   We examined differences in prostate cancer screening (prostate-specific antigen and/or digital rectal examination) testing practices after a diabetes diagnosis among lower-income persons living in the southeastern United States and enrolled in the Southern Community Cohort Study between 2002 and 2009. Baseline in-person interviews collected information on history of diabetes and prostate cancer screening from 18,809 black and 6,404 white men aged 40-79 years.  Results:   After adjustment for confounding, diabetic black [odds ratio (OR) 1.12, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.01-1.25] and white (OR 1.25, 95 % CI 1.03-1.51) men were more likely to undergo recent prostate cancer screening compared to non-diabetic men of the same race. The increased risk for prostate cancer screening, however, occurred primarily within the first 12 months after diabetes diagnosis.  Conclusions:   Our results suggest that a diabetes diagnosis modestly increases the likelihood of having a prostate cancer screening test for both black and white men. The prevalence of screening was higher nearer to the time of diabetes diagnosis, which may contribute to an early increase in prostate cancer detection followed by lower prostate cancer detection after an extended time.""","""['Maureen Sanderson', 'Jay H Fowke', 'Loren Lipworth', 'Xijing Han', 'Flora Ukoli', 'Ann L Coker', 'William J Blot', 'Margaret K Hargreaves']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Cancer Causes Control""","""['Demographic, Social Support, and Community Differences in Predictors of African-American and White Men Receiving Prostate Cancer Screening in the United States.', 'The association of diabetes and obesity with prostate cancer aggressiveness among Black Americans and White Americans in a population-based study.', 'Determinants of Prostate Specific Antigen Screening among Black Men in the United States in the Contemporary Era.', 'Investigating Black-White differences in prostate cancer prognosis: A systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Prostate cancer disparities in South Carolina: early detection, special programs, and descriptive epidemiology.', 'The Effect of Metformin on Male Reproductive Function and Prostate: An Updated Review.', 'Diabetes and cancer: Epidemiological and biological links.', 'The association of diabetes with risk of prostate cancer defined by clinical and molecular features.', 'Discordance in perceived risk and epidemiological outcomes of prostate cancer among African American men.', 'Diabetes, prostate cancer screening and risk of low- and high-grade prostate cancer: an 11\xa0year historical population follow-up study of more than 1 million men.']"""

This characteristic has been exploited for the development of diagnostic and therapeutic methods. As an example, prostatic acid phosphatase was the first marker for metastatic prostate cancer diagnosis and the dysregulation of tartrate resistant acid phosphatase is associated with abnormal bone resorption linked to osteoporosis. The pioneering crystallization studies on prostatic acid phosphatase and mammalian tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase conformed significant milestones towards the elucidation of the mechanisms followed by these enzymes (Schneider et al., EMBO J 12:2609-2615, 1993). Acid phosphatases are also found in nonmammalian species such as bacteria, fungi, parasites, and plants, and most of them share structural similarities with mammalian acid phosphatase enzymes. Acid phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.2) enzymes catalyze the hydrolysis of phosphate monoesters following the general equation. Phosphate monoester + H2O -->/<-- alcohol + phosphate. The general classification ""acid phosphatase"" relies only on the optimum acidic pH for the enzymatic activity in assay conditions using non-physiological substrates. These enzymes accept a wide range of substrates in vitro, ranging from small organic molecules to phosphoproteins, constituting a heterogeneous group of enzymes from the structural point of view. These structural differences account for the divergence in cofactor dependences and behavior against substrates, inhibitors, and activators. In this group only the tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase is a metallo-enzyme whereas the other members do not require metal-ion binding for their catalytic activity. In addition, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase and erythrocytic acid phosphatase are not inhibited by L-(+)-tartrate ion while the prostatic acid phosphatase is tartrate-sensitive. This is an important difference that can be exploited in in vitro assays to differentiate between different kinds of phosphatase activity. The search for more sensitive and specific methods of detection in clinical laboratory applications led to the development of radioimmunoassays (RIA) for determination of prostatic acid phosphatase in serum. These methods permit the direct quantification of the enzyme regardless of its activity status. Therefore, an independent structural classification exists that helps to group these enzymes according to their structural features and mechanisms. Based on this we can distinguish the histidine acid phosphatases (Van Etten, Ann N Y Acad Sci 390:27-51, 1982), the low molecular weight protein tyrosine acid phosphatases and the metal-ion dependent phosphatases. A note of caution is worthwhile mentioning here. The nomenclature of acid phosphatases has not been particularly easy for those new to the subject. Unfortunately, the acronym PAP is very common in the literature about purple acid phosphatases and prostatic acid phosphatase.

Daily displacements of the calcification within the prostate relative to pelvic bony structures were calculated by the ExacTrac X-ray system. The average displacement and standard deviation (SD) in each of the left-right (LR), anterior-posterior (AP), and superior-inferior (SI) directions were calculated for each patient.

In total, 899 data measurements from 24 patients were obtained. The average prostate displacements ± SD relative to bony structures were 2.8 ± 3.3, -2.0 ± 2.0 and 0.2 ± 0.4 mm, in the SI, AP and LR directions, respectively. The required PTV margins were 9.7, 6.1 and 1.4 mm in the SI, AP and LR directions, respectively. The clinical target volumes of 21 patients (87.5%) were located within the PTV for 90% or more of all treatment sessions. Interfractional prostate motion in the prone position with a thermoplastic shell was equivalent to that reported for the supine position.

Therefore, we investigated patients' and urologists' preferences for treatment alternatives for early prostate cancer (PC).  Methods:   A discrete choice experiment was conducted among 150 patients who were waiting for their biopsy results, and 150 urologists. Regression analysis was used to determine patients' and urologists' stated preferences using scenarios based on PC treatment modality (radiotherapy, surgery, and active surveillance (AS)), and risks of urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction.  Results:   The response rate was 110 out of 150 (73%) for patients and 50 out of 150 (33%) for urologists. Risk of urinary incontinence was an important determinant of both patients' and urologists' stated preferences for PC treatment (P<0.05). Treatment modality also influenced patients' stated preferences (P<0.05), whereas the risk of erectile dysfunction due to radiotherapy was mainly important to urologists (P<0.05). Both patients and urologists preferred AS to radical treatment, with the exception of patients with anxious/depressed feelings who preferred radical treatment to AS.  Conclusion:   Although patients and urologists generally may prefer similar treatments for PC, they showed different trade-offs between various specific treatment aspects.

Men with naturally red hair were significantly less likely to develop prostate cancer (HR=0.46, 95% CI 0.24-0.89) than men with light brown hair (reference).  Conclusion:   The red hair phenotype, which results from polymorphisms in the melanocortin-1-receptor (MC1R) gene, is associated with lower risk of prostate cancer.

In our previous study, HCA was also found to exhibit antiproliferative activity against a variety of cancer cells. However, the precise mechanism of action of HCA in the antitumor activity remains to be elucidated. In the present study, we identified the antimetastatic activity of HCA in the highly metastatic PC3 human prostate cancer cells. HCA showed potent growth inhibitory activity of the PC3 cells with an IC50 value of 0.81 µM. Further analysis revealed that HCA suppressed the expression of a potential metastatic biomarker, phosphatase of regenerating liver-3 (PRL-3), in PC3 cells. The suppression of PRL-3 by HCA sequentially down-regulates the expression of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) subunits p85 and p110. The antimetastatic effect of HCA was also correlated with the down-regulation of matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) and the modulation of cadherin switches N-cadherin and E-cadherin. In addition, HCA also effectively suppressed the migration and invasion of PC3 cells.

Our chief aim was to investigate a plausible mechanism for this phenomenon.  Materials and methods:   Growth of cultured human cancer cells, DU145 and Jurkat, exposed to power frequency magnetic field (MF) (60 Hz, 1 mT) for 3 days, was determined using a 2-(4-Iodophenyl)- 3-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-(2,4-disulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (WST-1) assay and a trypan blue exclusion assay. This experiment was repeated at incubators long-term monitoring period up to 5.3 years. A periodogram analysis was performed to investigate periodic patterns in the MF and sham effects on cell growth.  Results:   Unlike conventional assumptions, the MF effect on growth in both cell types was promotive or suppressive in a period-dependent manner. The converse cell growth induced by the MF was consistent in incubators, with little variation.  Conclusions:   Spatiotemporal evidence suggests that the period-dependent converse cell growth by the MF may contribute to the poor reproducibility and explain the adverse effects observed in previous experimental and epidemiological investigations. Additionally, the novel approach of this study may be applied to design features required to experimentally determine the effects of EMF on living organisms in a convincing manner.""","""['Ji-Eun Bae', 'Ji-Yeon Do', 'Soon-Hwan Kwon', 'Sang-Dae Lee', 'Yong Woo Jung', 'Soo-Chan Kim', 'Kwon-Seok Chae']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Biol""","""['A 60-Hz sinusoidal magnetic field induces apoptosis of prostate cancer cells through reactive oxygen species.', 'Evaluation of genotoxic and/or co-genotoxic effects in cells exposed in vitro to extremely-low frequency electromagnetic fields.', 'Extremely low frequency electromagnetic field enhances human keratinocyte cell growth and decreases proinflammatory chemokine production.', 'Extremely low frequency electromagnetic fields as effectors of cellular responses in vitro: possible immune cell activation.', 'Electromagnetic effects - From cell biology to medicine.', 'Magnetic Fields and Cancer: Epidemiology, Cellular Biology, and Theranostics.', 'Positive geotactic behaviors induced by geomagnetic field in Drosophila.']"""

The aim of this study was to compare cytotoxic effects of DATS on prostate cancer cells PC-3 and noncancerous human prostate epithelial cells PNT1A. PC-3 prostate cancer and noncancerous human prostate epithelial cells PNT1A were used in the study. We observed that PNT1A cells had higher resistance to DATS-induced cell death than PC-3 cells. Investigating signaling pathways involved in the cell death we observed that p66Shc phosphorylation at serine 36 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 activation induced by DATS, were significantly attenuated in PNT1A cells as compared to PC-3 cells. Moreover, DATS-induced Akt inactivation was also significantly reduced in PNT1A cells. In addition to that, DATS-induced reactive oxygen species generation was nearly completely abolished in PNT1A cells. Interestingly, DATS induced only slight decrease in the level of ferritin H, whereas ferritin L was elevated. These data suggest that cytotoxicity of DATS toward PNT1A cells is strongly reduced as opposed to PC-3 cancer cells, which corresponds to the lower activation of prodeath signaling pathway mediated by the adaptor protein p66Shc in the noncancerous PNT1A cells.""","""['Andzelika Borkowska', 'Narcyz Knap', 'Jędrzej Antosiewicz']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Nutr Cancer""","""['Diallyl trisulfide-induced prostate cancer cell death is associated with Akt/PKB dephosphorylation mediated by P-p66shc.', 'P66Shc mediated ferritin degradation--a novel mechanism of ROS formation.', 'c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase signaling axis regulates diallyl trisulfide-induced generation of reactive oxygen species and cell cycle arrest in human prostate cancer cells.', 'Anticancer effects of diallyl trisulfide derived from garlic.', 'The interplay between p66Shc, reactive oxygen species and cancer cell metabolism.', 'In Vitro Toxicity Studies of Bioactive Organosulfur Compounds from Allium spp. with Potential Application in the Agri-Food Industry: A Review.', 'The chemoprevention of spirulina platensis and garlic against diethylnitrosamine induced liver cancer in rats via amelioration of inflammatory cytokines expression and oxidative stress.', 'Postbiotics, Metabolic Signaling, and Cancer.', 'Organosulfur Compounds: A Review of Their Anti-inflammatory Effects in Human Health.', 'Comparison of Organosulfur and Amino Acid Composition between Triploid Onion Allium cornutum Clementi ex Visiani, 1842, and Common Onion Allium cepa L., and Evidences for Antiproliferative Activity of Their Extracts.']"""

To facilitate biomarker validation, we previously developed a chromatography-free stable isotope standards and capture by antipeptide antibodies (SISCAPA)-MALDI assay allowing rapid, high-throughput quantification of protein analytes in large sample sets. Here we applied this assay to the measurement of a surrogate proteotypic peptide from protein C inhibitor (PCI) in sera from patients with prostate cancer.  Methods:   A 2-plex SISCAPA-MALDI assay for quantification of proteotypic peptides from PCI and soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) was used to measure these peptides in 159 trypsin-digested sera collected from 51 patients with prostate cancer. These patients had been treated with radiation with or without neoadjuvant androgen deprivation.  Results:   Patients who experienced biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer showed decreased serum concentrations of the PCI peptide analyte within 18 months of treatment. The PCI peptide concentrations remained increased in the sera of patients who did not experience cancer recurrence. Prostate-specific antigen concentrations had no predictive value during the same time period.  Conclusions:   The high-throughput, liquid chromatography-free SISCAPA-MALDI assay is capable of rapid quantification of proteotypic PCI and sTfR peptide analytes in complex serum samples. Decreased serum concentrations of the PCI peptide were found to be related to recurrence of prostate cancer in patients treated with radiation with or without hormone therapy.

The aim of this study was to optimize serum isolation protocol to reduce the consumption of chemicals and sample volume. The following factors were optimized: amounts of (i) paramagnetic particles, (ii) oligo(dT)20 probe, (iii) serum, and (iv) the binding sequence (SMPs, oligo(dT)20 , serum vs. oligo(dT)20 , serum and SMPs). RNA content was measured, and the expression of metallothionein-2A as possible prostate cancer marker was analyzed to demonstrate measurable RNA content with ability for RT-PCR detection. Isolation is possible on serum volume range (10-200 μL) without altering of efficiency or purity. Amount of SMPs can be reduced up to 5 μL, with optimal results within 10-30 μL SMPs. Volume of oligo(dT)20 does not affect efficiency, when used within 0.1-0.4 μL.

However, PTK6 translocates from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in human prostate tumor cells. Here, we show that while PTK6 is located primarily within the cytoplasm, the pool of active PTK6 in prostate cancer cells localizes to membranes. Ectopic expression of membrane-targeted active PTK6 promoted epithelial-mesenchymal transition in part by enhancing activation of AKT, thereby stimulating cancer cell migration and metastases in xenograft models of prostate cancer. Conversely, siRNA-mediated silencing of endogenous PTK6 promoted an epithelial phenotype and impaired tumor xenograft growth. In mice, PTEN deficiency caused endogenous active PTK6 to localize at membranes in association with decreased E-cadherin expression. Active PTK6 was detected at membranes in some high-grade human prostate tumors, and PTK6 and E-cadherin expression levels were inversely correlated in human prostate cancers. In addition, high levels of PTK6 expression predicted poor prognosis in patients with prostate cancer.

We recently developed a new approach for RARP, passing through the pouch of Douglas and avoiding all the Retzius structures involved in continence and potency preservation.  Objective:   To report the functional and oncologic results of our first 200 patients operated on using this new approach.  Design, setting, and participants:   This was a prospective, noncontrolled case series including the first 200 consecutive patients undergoing this kind of surgery (January the 1st, 2010 to December the 31st, 2011).  Surgical procedure:   Retzius-sparing RARP.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   All perioperative, oncologic, and functional data were prospectively recorded. Potency was defined as an International Index of Erectile Function-5 questionnaire score >17; continence was defined as use of no pad or of one safety liner. Oncologic results were reported as positive surgical margins (PSM) and 1-yr biochemical disease-free survival (1y-bDFS). Recurrence was defined as a repeated prostate-specific antigen >0.2 ng/ml. Complications were graded according to the Clavien-Dindo system. The first 100 patients (group 1) were compared with the second 100 (group 2) to evaluate the learning curve effects.  Results and limitations:   The median patient age was 65 yr. Comparing the two groups, transfusions were needed in 8% versus 4% of cases in groups 1 and 2, respectively (p=0.02). There was one Clavien-Dindo grade 3b in group 1 versus one grade 3a complication in group 2. In patients with pT2 disease, PSMs were recorded in 22.4% of those in group 1 versus 10.1% in group 2 (p=0.045). 1y-bDFS was 89% in group 1 versus 92% in group 2. For groups 1 and 2, respectively, immediate continence was reached in 92% versus 90% of patients, and the 1-yr continence rate was 96% versus 96%. Considering the 77 potent patients aged <65 yr who underwent bilateral intrafascial nerve-sparing surgery, 40.4% of those in group 1 versus 40% of those in group 2 reached their first intercourse within 1 mo; at 1 yr of follow-up, these figures had increased to 81% versus 71%, respectively (p=0.162). The main limitation of this study is its noncontrolled nature.  Conclusions:   We demonstrated Retzius-sparing RARP to be oncologically safe and to result in high early continence and potency rates. Long-term, prospective, comparative, and possibly randomized studies are needed.""","""['Antonio Galfano', 'Dario Di Trapani', 'Francesco Sozzi', 'Elena Strada', 'Giovanni Petralia', 'Manuela Bramerio', 'Assunta Ascione', 'Marcello Gambacorta', 'Aldo Massimo Bocciardi']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Prostate cancer: Oncological vs functional outcomes for RARP--finding a balance.']"""

Adrenal 11OHA4 metabolism in CRPC is, however, unknown. We present a novel pathway for 11OHA4 metabolism in CRPC leading to the production of 11ketoT (11KT) and novel 5α-reduced C19 steroids - 11OH-5α-androstanedione, 11keto-5α-androstanedione, 11OHDHT and 11ketoDHT (11KDHT). The pathway was validated in the androgen-dependent prostate cancer cell line, LNCaP. Androgen receptor (AR) transactivation studies showed that while 11KT and 11OHDHT act as a partial AR agonists, 11KDHT is a full AR agonist exhibiting similar activity to DHT at 1nM. Our data demonstrates that, while 11OHA4 has negligible androgenic activity, its metabolism to 11KT and 11KDHT yields androgenic compounds which may be implicated, together with A4 and DHEA(S), in driving CRPC in the absence of testicular T.""","""['Karl-Heinz Storbeck', 'Liezl M Bloem', 'Donita Africander', 'Lindie Schloms', 'Pieter Swart', 'Amanda C Swart']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Mol Cell Endocrinol""","""['Profiling adrenal 11β-hydroxyandrostenedione metabolites in prostate cancer cells, tissue and plasma: UPC2-MS/MS quantification of 11β-hydroxytestosterone, 11keto-testosterone and 11keto-dihydrotestosterone.', '11β-hydroxyandrostenedione, the product of androstenedione metabolism in the adrenal, is metabolized in LNCaP cells by 5α-reductase yielding 11β-hydroxy-5α-androstanedione.', '11-Ketotestosterone and 11-Ketodihydrotestosterone in Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer: Potent Androgens Which Can No Longer Be Ignored.', '11β-Hydroxyandrostenedione: Downstream metabolism by 11βHSD, 17βHSD and SRD5A produces novel substrates in familiar pathways.', 'A new dawn for androgens: Novel lessons from 11-oxygenated C19 steroids.', 'The role of 11-oxygenated androgens in prostate cancer.', 'Interplay of Cortisol, Testosterone, and Abdominal Fat Mass in Normal-weight Women With Polycystic Ovary Syndrome.', 'Circulating adrenal 11-oxygenated androgens are associated with clinical outcome in endometrial cancer.', 'Adrenal gland involvement in 11-ketotestosterone production analyzed using LC-MS/MS.', 'Antiandrogenic Effects of a Polyphenol in Carex kobomugi through Inhibition of Androgen Synthetic Pathway and Downregulation of Androgen Receptor in Prostate Cancer Cell Lines.']"""

Materials and methods:   Patients were selected from a randomized trial for intermediate-risk prostate cancer. Of the patients entered on trial with mature follow-up, 3% developed grade 3 late proctitis. Blood samples were taken from this radiosensitive cohort along with matched control patients with no late proctitis. Whole blood samples were exposed to 0 or 4 Gy and cultured according to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) recommended methods. Colour junctions were evaluated in the resulting metaphases and scored according to the Protocol for Aberration Identification and Nomenclature Terminology (PAINT) system.  Results:   Both groups were statistically similar at 0 Gy. After 4 Gy in vitro radiation, the radiosensitive group had significantly higher rates of chromosome damage in the number of colour junctions per cell (p = 0.002), the number of deletions per cell (p = 0.01) and the number of dicentrics per cell (p = 0.005).

Prostate cancer and fracture characteristics and concomitant medications were recorded. Fracture patients with prior prostate cancer diagnosis were compared to control patients from the Tampere University prostate cancer database and the risk factors for fracture were analysed by binary logistic regression analysis.  Results:   In total, 133 patients (11.0% of hip fractures) had a prostate cancer diagnosis prior to fracture; of these, 111 (84.1%) had osteoporotic, 14 (10.6%) pathological and seven (5.3%) high-energy fractures.

Nine Latino men had prostate cancer, two had brain cancer, two had colorectal cancer, and two had lung cancer. Emerging themes involved the suddenness of the diagnosis, fear of dying, expectations of diagnosis-related communication, reliance on physicians for treatment decisions, limited information pertaining to ACP, family support, and role changes. Latino men's limited knowledge of cancer diagnosis and treatment options coupled with their fear led them to immediately believe that they were going to die. Knowledge gaps regarding diagnosis-related communication, treatment decisions, and ACP varied among the men.

Genetic counseling practitioners often discuss strategies for reducing the risk of cancer for patients at high risk due to their genetic background. Addressing modifiable health habits is one such strategy. Unfortunately, modifiable risk factors for prostate cancer have only been documented in the general population and have not yet been studied in the BRCA carrier subpopulation. Therefore, this study aimed to identify modifiable risk factors for prostate cancer in BRCA carriers. We examined prostate cancer risk factors in 74 men who were part of families with a BRCA mutation. This study examined nine dichotomous variables including: exercise, history of vasectomy, smoking history, alcohol use, finasteride use, statin use, aspirin use, coffee use, and vitamin use. The survey was sent to all cases of prostate cancer in the Hereditary Cancer Center Database at Creighton University with a known BRCA status. This study confirmed the protective benefits of daily aspirin use, which have been observed in previous studies of the general population, and suggests its benefit in BRCA carriers.

All these RBPs have an impact on RNA metabolism. Until recently, the PKP-associated RBPs have not been analyzed in prostate cancer. In the current study, we showed by affinity purification that the PKP3-associated RBPs were also binding partners of PKP1. We examined the expression of PKP1/3-associated RBPs and PKP1/3 in prostate cell lines, tumor-free prostate, and 136 prostatic adenocarcinomas by immunofluorescence and immunoblot. All four RBPs G3BP, FXR1, UPF1, and PABPC1 were expressed in the glandular epithelium of the normal prostate. PKP1 and FXR1 were strongly reduced in tumor tissues with Gleason score >7 and diminished expression of PKP1 and FXR1 also appeared to be associated with a metastatic phenotype. Additionally, the predominant nuclear localization of UPF1 in normal glandular cells and low grade tumors was switched to a more cytoplasmic pattern in carcinomas with Gleason score >7. Our findings suggest that PKP1 and FXR1 may have a tumor-suppressive function and are downregulated in more aggressive tumors. Collectively, PKP1/3-associated RBPs FXR1 and UPF1 may have a functional role in prostate cancer progression and metastasis and highlight the potential importance of posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression and nonsense-mediated decay in cancer.""","""['Cheng Yang', 'Philipp Ströbel', 'Alexander Marx', 'Ilse Hofmann']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Virchows Arch""","""['Plakophilins 1 and 3 bind to FXR1 and thereby influence the mRNA stability of desmosomal proteins.', 'Identification of the junctional plaque protein plakophilin 3 in cytoplasmic particles containing RNA-binding proteins and the recruitment of plakophilins 1 and 3 to stress granules.', 'Plakophilin 1-deficient cells upregulate SPOCK1: implications for prostate cancer progression.', 'Up-frameshift protein 1 (UPF1): multitalented entertainer in RNA decay.', 'UPFront and center in RNA decay: UPF1 in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay and beyond.', 'UPF1-From mRNA Degradation to Human Disorders.', 'Circulating Tumor Cell-Free DNA Genes as Prognostic Gene Signature for Platinum Resistant Ovarian Cancer Diagnosis.', 'Identification of PKP 2/3 as potential biomarkers of ovarian cancer based on bioinformatics and experiments.', 'The RNA-binding protein FXR1 modulates prostate cancer progression by regulating FBXO4.', 'Identification of molecular genetic contributants to canine cutaneous mast cell tumour metastasis by global gene expression analysis.']"""

By performing AFA on gene expression data from prostate cancer cell lines DU-145 (an HDACi-sensitive cell line) and PC3 (a relatively HDACi-resistant cell line) treated with HDACis valproic acid or vorinostat, we identified biological processes that are affected by HDACis and are therefore potential treatment targets for combination therapy. Our analysis revealed that HDAC-inhibition resulted among others in upregulation of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes and deregulation of the mitotic spindle checkpoint by downregulation of genes involved in mitosis. These findings were confirmed by AFA on publicly available data sets from HDACi-treated prostate cancer cells.

PRDX-3 is a member of the peroxiredoxin family that are responsible for neutralising reactive oxygen species.  Experimental design:   PRDX-3 expression was examined in tissue from 32 patients using immunohistochemistry. Subcellular distribution was determined using confocal microscopy. PRDX-3 expression was determined in antiandrogen-resistant cell lines by western blotting and quantitative RT-PCR. The pathways of PRDX-3 overexpression and knockdown on apoptosis and response to oxidative stress were investigated using protein arrays.  Results:   PRDX-3 is upregulated in a number of endocrine-regulated tumours; in particular in PCa and prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia. Although the majority of PRDX-3 is localised to the mitochondria, we have confirmed that PRDX-3 at the cell membrane is androgen regulated. In antiandrogen-resistant LNCaP cell lines, PRDX-3 is upregulated at the protein but not RNA level. Resistant cells also possess an upregulation of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) pathway and resistance to H₂O₂-induced apoptosis through a failure to activate pro-apoptotic pathways. Knockdown of PRDX-3 restored H₂O₂ sensitivity.  Conclusion:   Our results suggest that PRDX-3 has an essential role in regulating oxidation-induced apoptosis in antiandrogen-resistant cells.

This pilot study evaluated the role of dose escalation and appropriate target volume margin. Here, we report long-term follow-up.  Methods:   Eligible patients had T1b-T3b N0 M0 PC. After neoadjuvant AS, they were randomised to CFRT, giving (a) 64 Gy with either a 1.0- or 1.5-cm margin and (b) ±10 Gy boost to the prostate alone.  Results:   One hundred and twenty-six men were randomised and treated. Median follow-up was 13.7 years. The median age was 66.6 years at randomisation. Median presenting prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was 14 ng ml(-1). Sixty-four out of 126 patients developed PSA failure. Forty-nine out of 126 patients restarted AS, 34 out of 126 developed metastases and 28 out of 126 developed castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Fifty-one out of 126 patients died; 19 out of 51 died of PC. Median overall survival (OS) was 14.4 years. Although escalated dose results were favourable, no statistically significant differences were seen between the randomised groups; PSA control (hazard ratio (HR): 0.77 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.47-1.26)), development of CRPC (HR: 0.81 (95% CI: 0.40-1.65)), PC-specific survival (HR: 0.59 (95% CI:0.23-1.49)) and OS (HR: 0.81 (95% CI: 0.47-1.40)).

Therefore, we planned transcriptome characterisation of adult prostate SCs as a strategy to consider new targets for cancer treatment.  Methods:   Intuitive pathway analysis was used for putative target discovery in 12 matched selections of human prostate SCs, transiently amplifying cells and terminally differentiated cells. These were pooled into three groups according to the stage of differentiation for mRNA microarray analysis.

Results:   A deficiency in class 1 UDP glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzymes (UGT1A) was identified in prostate SCs, which are involved in androgen catabolism. Class 1 UGT enzyme expression was also downregulated in cancer SCs and during progression to metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Reduction of UGT1A expression in vitro was seen to improve cell survival and increase androgen receptor (AR) activity, as shown by upregulation of prostate-specific antigen expression.

The measurements of the positron activation induced in a preoperative rectal cancer patient and a prostate cancer patient following 50 MV photon treatments are presented. A total dose of 5 and 8 Gy, respectively, were delivered to the tumors. Imaging was performed with a 64-slice PET/CT scanner for 30 min, starting 7 min after the end of the treatment. The CT volume from the PET/CT and the treatment planning CT were coregistered by matching anatomical reference points in the patient. The treatment delivery was imaged in vivo based on the distribution of the induced positron emitters produced by photonuclear reactions in tissue mapped on to the associated dose distribution of the treatment plan. The results showed that spatial distribution of induced activity in both patients agreed well with the delivered beam portals of the treatment plans in the entrance subcutaneous fat regions but less so in blood and oxygen rich soft tissues. For the preoperative rectal cancer patient however, a 2 ± (0.5) cm misalignment was observed in the cranial-caudal direction of the patient between the induced activity distribution and treatment plan, indicating a beam patient setup error. No misalignment of this kind was seen in the prostate cancer patient. However, due to a fast patient setup error in the PET/CT scanner a slight mis-position of the patient in the PET/CT was observed in all three planes, resulting in a deformed activity distribution compared to the treatment plan. The present study indicates that the induced positron emitters by high energy photon beams can be measured quite accurately using PET imaging of subcutaneous fat to allow portal verification of the delivered treatment beams. Measurement of the induced activity in the patient 7 min after receiving 5 Gy involved count rates which were about 20 times lower than that of a patient undergoing standard (18)F-FDG treatment. When using a combination of short lived nuclides such as (15)O (half-life: 2 min) and (11)C (half-life: 20 min) with low activity it is not optimal to use clinical reconstruction protocols. Thus, it might be desirable to further optimize reconstruction parameters as well as to address hardware improvements in realizing in vivo treatment verification with PET/CT in the future. A significant improvement with regard to (15)O imaging could also be expected by having the PET/CT unit located close to the radiation treatment room.""","""['Sara Janek Strååt', 'Björn Andreassen', 'Cathrine Jonsson', 'Marilyn E Noz', 'Gerald Q Maguire', 'Peder Näfstadius', 'Ingemar Näslund', 'Frederic Schoenahl', 'Anders Brahme']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['In vivo verification of proton beam path by using post-treatment PET/CT imaging.', 'Development of dose delivery verification by PET imaging of photonuclear reactions following high energy photon therapy.', 'Volumetric modulated arc therapy planning for primary prostate cancer with selective intraprostatic boost determined by 18F-choline PET/CT.', 'Biologically optimized 3-dimensional in vivo predictive assay-based radiation therapy using positron emission tomography-computerized tomography imaging.', 'Recent advances in light ion radiation therapy.']"""

Epidemiological studies have suggested that use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may protect against PC. Inborn variations in genes involved in the inflammatory response may modulate the risk of PC and interact with NSAIDs. The aims of this study were 1) to evaluate whether polymorphisms and haplotypes of the inflammation-related genes COX-2, Il1B, NFKB1, and PPARG are associated with risk of PC; 2) to investigate gene-environment interactions between polymorphisms and NSAID use; and 3) to examine whether the studied polymorphisms were associated with the aggressiveness of PC. The study population consisted of 370 cases of PC and 370 risk-set matched (age) controls nested within the prospective Danish ""Diet, Cancer, and Health"" cohort. Carriers of the variant deletion allele of NFKB1 -94ins/delATTG had a tendency toward a reduced risk of PC (incidence rate ratio (IRR), 0.73; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.52-1.04). A lowered risk for PC was also found for carriers of variant allele NFKB1 -94ins/delATTG among non-users of NSAIDs (IRR 0.68; 95% CI 0.47-0.99), for non-aggressive disease (IRR 0.64; 95% CI 0.42-0.99), and among men with a body mass index above 30 kg/m(2) (IRR 0.56; 95% CI 0.27-1.16), although the latter estimate was based on small numbers.

Ghrelin is modified by a unique acylation required for it to activate its cognate receptor, the growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR), which mediates many of the actions of ghrelin. Recently, the enzyme responsible for adding the fatty acid residue (octanoyl/acyl group) to the third amino acid of ghrelin, GOAT (ghrelin O-acyltransferase), was identified.  Methods:   We used cell culture, quantitative real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR and immunohistochemistry to demonstrate the expression of GOAT in prostate cancer cell lines and tissues from patients. Real-time RT-PCR was used to demonstrate the expression of prohormone convertase (PC)1/3, PC2 and furin in prostate cancer cell lines. Prostate-derived cell lines were treated with ghrelin and desacyl ghrelin and the effect on GOAT expression was measured using quantitative RT-PCR.  Results:   We have demonstrated that GOAT mRNA and protein are expressed in the normal prostate and human prostate cancer tissue samples. The RWPE-1 and RWPE-2 normal prostate-derived cell lines and the LNCaP, DU145, and PC3 prostate cancer cell lines express GOAT and at least one other enzyme that is necessary to produce mature, acylated ghrelin from proghrelin (PC1/3, PC2 or furin). Finally, ghrelin, but not desacyl ghrelin (unacylated ghrelin), can directly regulate the expression of GOAT in the RWPE-1 normal prostate derived cell line and the PC3 prostate cancer cell line. Ghrelin treatment (100nM) for 6 hours significantly decreased GOAT mRNA expression two-fold (P < 0.05) in the PC3 prostate cancer cell line, however, ghrelin did not regulate GOAT expression in the DU145 and LNCaP prostate cancer cell lines.  Conclusions:   This study demonstrates that GOAT is expressed in prostate cancer specimens and cell lines. Ghrelin regulates GOAT expression, however, this is likely to be cell-type specific. The expression of GOAT in prostate cancer supports the hypothesis that the ghrelin axis has autocrine/paracrine roles.

Local treatments of primary prostate cancer are defined as radical retropubic prostatectomy (RRP) or external beam radiation therapy (EBRT).  Patients and methods:   Patient records were reviewed in five different hospitals in Sydney, Australia, and 263 men with CRPC were identified. Eligible patients comprised men who had progressive disease during androgen deprivation therapy with castrate levels of testosterone. Clinical and pathological data were reviewed and evaluated using the chi-squared test and relative risk analysis to determine the relationship between previous local prostate treatment and complications secondary to local disease. The end-point was complications and morbidity attributed to cancer progression locally (i.e. from the prostate).  Results:   Primary treatment of the prostate by either RRP or EBRT significantly reduces the incidence of local complications compared to no primary treatment (32.6% vs 54.6%; P = 0.001). RRP showed a significantly lower level of local complications compared to EBRT (20.0% vs 46.7%; P = 0.007). The most common local complications were bladder outlet obstruction (35.0%) and ureteric obstruction (15.2%).

CBCT image quality is limited by low contrast and imaging artifacts, but few data have been reported about inter-observer variability of bladder boundary delineation on CBCT. The aim of this work was to analyze and evaluate the inter-observer contouring uncertainties of bladder boundary delineation on CBCT images in a prospective fashion.  Methods:   Five radiation oncologists contoured 10 bladders using the CBCT datasets of consecutive 10 patients (including 4 females) who were irradiated to the pelvic region. Prostates were also contoured in male patients. Patients who had had prostatectomy were excluded. The coefficient of variation (COV), conformity index (CI(gen)), and coordinates of center-of-mass (COM) of the bladder and prostate were calculated for each patient.  Results:   The mean COV for the bladder and prostate was 0.08 and 0.20, respectively. The mean CI(gen) of the bladder and prostate was 0.81 and 0.66, respectively. The root mean square (RMS) of the inter-observer standard deviation (σ) of the COM displacement in the left-right (LR) and anterior-posterior (AP) direction was 0.79, 0.87 and 0.54 for the bladder and 0.63, 0.99 and 1.72 for the prostate. Regarding the mean COV and CI(gen) for the bladder, the differences between males and females were not significant.

In addition, E-cadherin expression was studied within the concept of epithelial mesenchymal plasticity.  Material and methods:   Seventy-five patients with clinically localized PCa who underwent a superextended lymphadenectomy followed by radical prostatectomy (RP) were included in this study. Preoperative plasma/serum levels of endoglin, transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), osteopontin, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), and E-cadherin were measured using commercially available enzyme immunoassays in 47/75 patients and correlated with clinicopathological parameters. E-cadherin expression in the diagnostic biopsies (n = 63), RP specimens (n = 75) and LN metastases (n = 106) was examined by immunohistochemical analysis.  Results:   Occult LN metastases were present in almost half of the patients (37/75), with a total of 106 affected LN. Preoperative levels of endoglin, TGF-β1, osteopontin, VEGF, VCAM-1 nor E-cadherin were significantly associated with LN status. Only a positive correlation between plasma endoglin and serum prostate-specific antigen was found (Spearman's r = 0.44; p = 0.002). The majority of biopsies (91.9%) and RP specimens (79.7%) showed strong E-cadherin expression, while in the LN this was found to be much weaker (28.9%). While the staining pattern in the isolated tumor cells (ITC) and micrometastases was mainly homogenous, the macrometastases showed a much more heterogeneous pattern (χ², p < 0.0001).  Conclusion:   In this study, none of the blood-based markers tested could be used for nodal staging in PCa, nor could E-cadherin expression in the tissue. However, the difference in E-cadherin expression pattern between the ITC/micrometastases and the macrometastases may point to another biological behavior. The specific staining pattern seen in the macrometastases could indicate an ongoing mesenchymal epithelial transition, presumed to be a mechanism for metastatic colonization. As the latter is the rate-limiting step in the metastatic process, evaluation of the E-cadherin expression pattern could have potential therapeutic implications.""","""['Sofie Isebaert', 'Karin Haustermans', 'Laura Van den Bergh', 'Steven Joniau', 'Piet Dirix', 'Raymond Oyen', 'Christophe M Deroose', 'Hendrik Van Poppel', 'Evelyne Lerut']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Acta Oncol""","""['Radical prostatectomy improves progression-free and cancer-specific survival in men with lymph node positive prostate cancer in the prostate-specific antigen era: a confirmatory study.', 'Does increasing the nodal yield improve outcomes in contemporary patients without nodal metastasis undergoing radical prostatectomy?', 'Use of preoperative plasma endoglin for prediction of lymph node metastasis in patients with clinically localized prostate cancer.', 'Staging of women with breast cancer after introduction of sentinel node guided axillary dissection.', 'Anatomical extent of pelvic lymphadenectomy in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy.', 'Preoperative plasma level of endoglin as a predictor for disease outcomes after radical cystectomy for nonmetastatic urothelial carcinoma of the bladder.', 'Update on histopathological evaluation of lymphadenectomy specimens from prostate cancer patients.', 'Is there still a role for computed tomography and bone scintigraphy in prostate cancer staging?

DIR based on image intensities alone is promising for online applications, but is challenged in regions with low intensity gradients. In this study we have investigated the performance of intensity- based DIR applied to contour propagation of the rectum and bladder, focusing on the consequences in terms of dose/volume parameters.  Material and methods:   The rectum and bladder volumes were delineated in the planning computed tomography (pCT) scan and in 8-9 repeat CTs (Vmanual) for nine prostate cancer patients. The volumes from the pCT were propagated onto the repeat CTs using intensity-based DIR (Vprop). Dose/volume parameters for Vmanual and Vprop were derived by dose re-calculations following rigid registration on prostate fiducials. Linear regression was used to identify qualitative and quantitative volumetric measures of the DIR performance being associated with the differences in dose/volume parameters.  Results:   The median differences in dose/volume parameters assessed for Vprop and Vmanual were modest, but individual differences ~7 Gy were seen. The observed differences in dose/volume parameters showed strong correlations to the measures of the DIR performance as well as with the volume variations, most pronounced for the rectum (R(2) = 0.63-0.85; p ≤ 0.05).

We retrospectively analyzed the surgical outcomes including EF, continence, and perioperative complications.  Results:   At 6 months after surgery, EF recovery rate was 28.5% in group 1 and 17.4% in group 2 (P=0.006). In a subgroup analysis consisting of 225 patients with a preoperative International Index of Erectile Function Short Survey (IIEF)-5 score ≥20, the difference in EF recovery at 6 months was significant with 62.8% in group 1 and 27.0% in group 2 (P=0.002), respectively. HACM use was an independent predictor for EF recovery at 6 months after surgery (odds ratio, 2.735; 95% confidence interval, 1.613-4.638; P<0.001). Age and preoperative IIEF-5 were also independent predictors. No differences in continence at 6 months or perioperative complications were found between the two groups.

Results:   In the 101 674 men reporting no prior diagnosis of prostate cancer, 39.31% (95% CI, 39.01%-39.61%) had no ED, 25.14% (95% CI, 24.87%-25.40%) had mild ED (ie, experienced ED sometimes), 18.79% (95% CI, 18.55%-19.03%) had moderate (ie, usually experienced) ED and 16.77% (95% CI, 16.55%-17.00%) had complete ED. After adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics, the odds of moderate/complete ED increased by 11.30% (OR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.11-1.12) each year from the age of 45 years. Overall, the risk of moderate/complete ED was higher among men with low socioeconomic status, high body mass index, those who were sedentary, current smokers and those with diseases including diabetes, heart disease, and depression/anxiety, compared with men without these risk factors. Moderate alcohol consumption was associated with a significantly reduced risk of ED in men aged 45-54 years, but not in older men. Almost all men aged 75 or older reported moderate/severe ED; however, increased physical activity was associated with a lower odds of ED in this group.

Recent investigations using housekeeping and virulence genes have revealed that the species consists of three major evolutionary clades (types I, II, and III). In order to investigate protein expression differences between these phylogroups, proteomic profiles of 21 strains of P. acnes were investigated. The proteins extracted from cells cultured under anaerobic and aerobic conditions were analysed using a SELDI-TOF mass spectrometer, high-resolution capillary gel electrophoresis, and LC-MS/ MS. The SELDI spectral profiles were visualised as a heat map and a dendrogram, which resulted in four proteomic groups. Strains belonging to type I were represented in the proteome Group A, while Group B contained type III strains. Groups C and D contained mixtures of types I and II. Each of these groups was not influenced by differences in culture conditions.

Purpose:   To prospectively investigate a scoring system for functional prostate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using in-bore MR-guided prostate biopsy at 3-T.  Material and methods:   Prostate MRI examinations of 59 patients (between February 2011 and May 2012) with no known prostate cancer, elevated prostate specific antigen (PSA) level, and unsuspicious digital rectal examination were included in the study. In each patient up to three lesions were defined and scored using a 5-point scoring system for each MR sequence (T2-weighted images, diffusion-weighted imaging, dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging). Following MRI-guided in-bore biopsy these lesions were correlated to the histopathological findings.  Results:   A total number of 144 lesions were defined in 59 patients. In 28 patients (51 lesions) MR-guided in-bore biopsy was positive for tumor (Gleason grade 6 or higher). A cut-off limit of 10 or more points in summation of the individual scores of all three sequences was used, leading to a 90% sensitivity, 63% specificity, 58% positive predictive value, and 92% negative predictive value.

We investigated the association of toenail selenium, reflecting long-term selenium exposure, and advanced PCa risk in a population from the Netherlands where low selenium status is widespread.  Methods:   The analysis was conducted in the prospective Netherlands Cohort Study, which included 58 279 men aged 55 to 69 years at baseline in 1986. All cohort members completed a baseline questionnaire, and approximately 79% of participants provided toenail clippings, which were used for toenail selenium measurements using instrumental neutron activation analysis. Incident advanced PCa case subjects from the entire cohort were identified during 17.3 years of follow-up. The study employed a case-cohort design for which a random subcohort was sampled at baseline. Hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using Cox proportional hazards regression models. All tests were two-sided.  Results:   Complete toenail selenium data were available for 898 advanced (International Union Against Cancer stage III/IV) PCa case subjects and 1176 subcohort members. The average toenail selenium concentration of subcohort members was 0.550 µg/g. Toenail selenium was associated with a reduced risk of advanced PCa; adjusted hazard ratio for the highest vs lowest quintile was 0.37 (95% CI = 0.27 to 0.51; P trend < .001). For stage IV PCa, men in the highest vs lowest quintile of toenail selenium had an adjusted hazard ratio of 0.30 (95% CI = 0.21 to 0.45; P trend < .001).

Methods:   Cancer incidence data from 1990 through 2008 were obtained from 13 Surveillance, Epidemiology, End Results (SEER) registries. Incidence rates from 1990 through 2008 and average percentage change were computed using SEER*Stat and Joinpoint software. The annual percentage change (APC) in incidence rates was estimated with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) calculated for both the rate and APC estimates. Rates for non-Hispanic whites are presented for comparison.  Results:   Prostate cancer was the most common malignancy among most groups, followed by lung, colorectal, liver, and stomach cancers. Breast cancer was generally the most common cancer in women, followed by colorectal and lung cancers; liver, cervix, thyroid, and stomach cancers also ranked highly.

In vivo studies further showed that PTEN(+/-) mice lacking macrophage AR developed far fewer prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) lesions, supporting an in vivo role for macrophage AR during prostate tumorigenesis. CCL4-neutralizing antibody effectively blocked macrophage-induced prostate tumorigenic signaling and targeting AR via an AR-degradation enhancer, ASC-J9, reduced CCL4 expression, and xenografted tumor growth in vivo. Importantly, CCL4 upregulation was associated with increased Snail expression and downregulation of p53/PTEN in high-grade PIN and prostate cancer.

We hypothesize that many modifications in cellular macromolecules, observed in cancer progression, may be caused by redox imbalance. Recent biochemical data suggest that human prostate cancer cell lines show a redox imbalance (oxidizing) compared with benign primary prostate epithelial cells; the degree of oxidation varied with aggressive behavior of each cell line. Our recent data suggest that human breast cancer tissues show a redox imbalance (reducing) compared with benign adjacent breast tissues. Accumulating data summarized in this article suggest that redox imbalance may regulate gene expression and alter protein stability by posttranslational modifications, in turn modulating existing cellular programs. Despite significant improvements in cancer therapeutics, resistance occurs, and redox imbalance may play a role in this process. Studies show that some cancer therapeutic agents increase generation of reactive oxygen/nitrogen species and antioxidant enzymes, which may alter total antioxidant capacity, cause cellular adaptation, and result in reduced effectiveness of treatment modalities. Approaches involving modulations of intra- and extracellular redox states, in combination with other therapies, may lead to new treatment options, especially for patients who are resistant to standard treatments.""","""['Tonia C Jorgenson', 'Weixiong Zhong', 'Terry D Oberley']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Cancer Res""","""['Reactive Oxygen and Nitrogen Species-Induced Protein Modifications: Implication in Carcinogenesis and Anticancer Therapy.', 'Thioredoxin 1 as a subcellular biomarker of redox imbalance in human prostate cancer progression.', 'Programmed cell death, redox imbalance, and cancer therapeutics.', 'The variable chemotherapeutic response of Malabaricone-A in leukemic and solid tumor cell lines depends on the degree of redox imbalance.', 'Redox Mechanisms in Neurodegeneration: From Disease Outcomes to Therapeutic Opportunities.', 'Antitumor effect of selenium-rich Brazil nuts and selenomethionine dietary supplementation on pre-existing 4T1 mammary tumor growth in mice.', 'Bioimaging agents based on redox-active transition metal complexes.', 'Redox homeostasis modulation using theranostic AIE nanoparticles results in positive-feedback drug accumulation and enhanced drug penetration to combat drug-resistant cancer.', 'Drug-induced tumor-specific cytotoxicity in\xa0a whole tissue\xa0ex vivo\xa0model of human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.', ""APE1 redox function is required for activation of Yes-associated protein 1 under reflux conditions in Barrett's-associated esophageal adenocarcinomas.""]"""

Ectopic expression of SND1 has been observed in various tumors including colon cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), indicating a positive role of SND1 in tumor initiation and progression. However, the exact role of SND1 in cancers has not been thoroughly investigated. In the present study, we investigated the role of SND1 in HCC. Immunohistochemistry analysis revealed that the expression level of SND1 was higher in HCC tissues than in adjacent nontumor tissues. Stable knock-down of SND1, performed on the HCC cell line SMMC-7721 using shRNA lentiviral expression system, led to reduced cell proliferation, clone formation and tumor formation in nude mice. The insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling pathway was frequently dysregulated in HCC, which could facilitate tumor progression. Screening of gene expression levels of the IGF pathway, using real-time PCR, revealed that a decrease in SND1 expression could increase the expression of IGF-binding protein 3 (IGFBP3), which can negatively regulate activation of the IGF pathway by restricting interactions between IGF and IGF receptors. Results from previous studies showed that the downregulation of IGFBP3 expression is a common feature in HCC, and the upregulation of IGFBP3 expression could suppress HCC cells proliferation. We further confirmed that stable knock-down of IGFBP3 could promote SMMC-7721 cells proliferation.

Patients were required to have a second prescription of the same insulin within 180 days and to be free of cancer. We balanced cohorts on risk factors for cancer outcomes based on comorbidities, comedication, and health care use during the prior 12 months using inverse probability of treatment weighting. Incident cancer was defined as having two claims for cancer (any cancer) or the same cancer (breast, prostate, colon) within 2 months. We estimated adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and their 95% CI using weighted Cox models censoring for stopping, switching, or augmenting insulin treatment, end of enrollment, and mortality.  Results:   More patients initiated glargine (43,306) than NPH (9,147). Initiators of glargine (NPH) were followed for 1.2 (1.1) years and 50,548 (10,011) person-years; 993 (178) developed cancer.

In the present study, the apoptotic mechanism of action of RG003 (2'-hydroxy-4-methylsulfonylchalcone) and RG005 (4'-chloro-2'-hydroxy-4-methylsulfonylchalcone) in association with intracellular signalling pathways was investigated in the hormone-independent prostate carcinoma cells PC-3 and DU145.

Furthermore, in regard to our results, it is clear that the simultaneous inhibition of Akt and NF-κB signalling can significantly contribute to the anticancer effects of RG003 and RG005 in PC-3 prostate cancer cells.

The effect on polymerase activity is unexpected because the point mutations that comprise the triple mutant are not part of the active site. Herein, we demonstrate the mechanism of this loss-of-function. In order to understand the effect of the individual point mutations we biochemically analyzed all single and double mutants that comprise the triple mutant. We found that the p.I298T mutation is responsible for a marked instability of the triple mutant protein at 37˚C. At room temperature the triple mutant's low efficiency is also due to a decrease in the apparent binding affinity for the dNTP substrate, which is due to the p.T292A mutation. Furthermore, the triple mutant displays lower fidelity for transversions in vitro, due to the p.T292A mutation.

To our knowledge, no study has yet compared the effect of multiple different fats on PCa progression. We sought to systematically compare the effect of fish oil, olive oil, corn oil and animal fat on PCa progression.  Methods:   A total of 96 male severe combined immunodeficient mice were injected with LAPC-4 human PCa cells. Two weeks following injection, mice were randomized to a Western diet based on fish oil, olive oil, corn oil or animal fat (35% kilocalories from fat). Animals were euthanized when tumor volumes reached 1000 mm(3). Serum was collected at death and assayed for PSA, insulin, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), IGF-1-binding protein-3 and prostaglandin E-2 (PGE-2) levels. Tumors were also assayed for PGE-2 and cyclooxygenase-2 levels, and global gene expression was analyzed using Affymetrix microarrays.  Results:   Mice weights and tumor volumes were equivalent across groups at randomization. Overall, fish oil consumption was associated with improved survival relative to other dietary groups (P=0.014). On gene expression analyses, the fish oil group had decreased signal in pathways related to mitochondrial physiology and insulin synthesis/secretion.  Conclusions:   In this xenograft model, we found that consuming a diet in which fish oil was the only fat source slowed tumor growth and improved survival compared with that in mice consuming diets composed of olive oil, corn oil or animal fat. Although prior studies showed that the amount of fat is important for PCa growth, this study suggests that the type of dietary fat consumed may also be important.""","""['J C Lloyd', 'E M Masko', 'C Wu', 'M M Keenan', 'D M Pilla', 'W J Aronson', 'J-Ta Chi', 'S J Freedland']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['Carbohydrate restriction, prostate cancer growth, and the insulin-like growth factor axis.', 'The effects of varying dietary carbohydrate and fat content on survival in a murine LNCaP prostate cancer xenograft model.', 'Effect of isocaloric low-fat diet on human LAPC-4 prostate cancer xenografts in severe combined immunodeficient mice and the insulin-like growth factor axis.', 'Dietary fat and colon cancer: animal model studies.', 'Dietary fat, calories, and mammary gland tumorigenesis.', 'CircRNA MBOAT2 promotes intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma progression and lipid metabolism reprogramming by stabilizing PTBP1 to facilitate FASN mRNA cytoplasmic export.', 'Effects of dietary omega-3 fatty acids on orthotopic prostate cancer progression, tumor associated macrophages, angiogenesis and T-cell activation-dependence on GPR120.', 'Effects of Dietary n-3 and n-6 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids in Inflammation and Cancerogenesis.', 'Dietary intake and prostate cancer, continued pursuit for evidence.', 'Omega-3 Fatty Acids Survey in Men under Active Surveillance for Prostate Cancer: from Intake to Prostate Tissue Level.']"""

It is thus essential to identify novel therapeutic targets for taxane resistance in CRPC patients. We investigated the role of the chemokine (C-C motif) receptor 1 (CCR1) and its ligand, chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 5 (CCL5), in taxane-resistant CRPC using paclitaxel-resistant prostate cancer cells (PC3PR) established from PC3 cells. We found that the expression levels of CCR1 mRNA and protein were up-regulated in PC3PR cells compared to PC3 cells. In order to investigate the role of increased CCR1 in PC3PR cells, we stimulated cells with CCL5, one of the chemokine ligands of CCR1. In CCL5-stimulated PC3PR cells, siRNA-mediated knockdown of CCR1 expression reduced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and Rac1/cdc42. Furthermore, CCR1 knockdown and MEK1/2 inhibition decreased CCL5-stimulated secretion of MMPs 2 and 9, which play important roles in cancer cell invasion and metastasis. In the Matrigel invasion assay, knockdown of CCR1 and inhibition of the ERK and Rac signaling pathways significantly decreased the number of invading cells. Finally, the serum CCL5 protein level as measured by ELISA was not different among the three groups of patients: those with negative prostate biopsy, those at initial diagnosis of prostate cancer, and those with taxane-resistant prostate cancer. These results demonstrated for the first time that the interaction of CCR1 with CCL5 caused by increased expression of CCR1 promotes invasion of PC3PR cells by increasing secretion of MMPs 2 and 9 and by activating ERK and Rac signaling.

The reference GTV-dataset was contoured by a radiologist with expertise in diagnostic imaging of prostate cancer using MRI. Subsequent GTV-delineation was performed by 5 radiation oncologists who received teaching of MRI-features of primary prostate cancer before starting contouring session. GTV-datasets were contoured using Oncentra Masterplan® and iplan® Net. For purposes of comparison GTV-datasets were imported to the Artiview® platform (Aquilab®), GTV-values and the similarity indices or Kappa indices (KI) were calculated with the postulation that a KI > 0.7 indicates excellent, a KI > 0.6 to < 0.7 substantial and KI > 0.5 to < 0.6 moderate agreement. Additionally all observers rated difficulties of contouring for each MRI-sequence using a 3 point rating scale (1 = easy to delineate, 2 = minor difficulties, 3 = major difficulties).  Results:   GTV contouring using T2w (KI-T2w = 0.61) and DCE images (KI-DCE = 0.63) resulted in substantial agreement. GTV contouring using DWI images resulted in moderate agreement (KI-DWI = 0.51). KI-T2w and KI-DCE was significantly higher than KI-DWI (p = 0.01 and p = 0.003). Degree of difficulty in contouring GTV was significantly lower using T2w and DCE compared to DWI-sequences (both p < 0.0001).

Fructose-6P, glutamine, and acetyl-CoA are central metabolites and substrates of the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway (HBP) to UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc), an essential high-energy donor for protein glycosylation. Golgi and cytosolic glycosylation pathways are sensitive to UDP-GlcNAc levels, which in turn regulates metabolic homeostasis in a poorly understood manner. To study the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway in cancer cells, we developed a targeted approach for cellular metabolomics profiling by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Human cervical (HeLa) and prostate cancer (PC-3) cell lines were cultured in medium with increasing concentrations of glucose, glutamine, or GlcNAc to perturb the metabolic network. Principal component analysis indicated trends that were further analyzed as individual metabolites and pathways. HeLa cell metabolism was predominantly glycolytic, while PC-3 cells showed a greater dependency on extracellular glutamine. In both cell lines, UDP-GlcNAc levels declined with glucose but not glutamine starvation, whereas glutamine abundance increased UDP-GlcNAc levels 2-3-fold. GlcNAc supplementation increased UDP-GlcNAc 4-8-fold in both HeLa and PC-3 cells. GlcNAc supplementation in HeLa cells induced nonmonotonic changes in NADH/NAD+, NADPH/NADP+, reactive oxygen species, and reduced/oxidized glutathione. In PC-3 cells, GlcNAc supplementation also increased glucose and glutamine uptake and catabolism.

The β2-microglobulin (β2-M)/hemochromatosis (HFE) complex plays an important role in cancer development and bone metastasis. We demonstrated previously that overexpression of β2-M in prostate, breast, lung and renal cancer leads to increased bone metastasis in mouse models. Therefore, we hypothesized that β2-M is a rational target to treat prostate cancer bone metastasis.  Results:   In this study, we demonstrate the role of β2-M and its binding partner, HFE, in modulating radiation sensitivity and chemo-sensitivity of prostate cancer. By genetic deletion of β2-M or HFE or using an anti-β2-M antibody (Ab), we demonstrate that prostate cancer cells are sensitive to radiation in vitro and in vivo. Inhibition of β2-M or HFE sensitized prostate cancer cells to radiation by increasing iron and reactive oxygen species and decreasing DNA repair and stress response proteins. Using xenograft mouse model, we demonstrate that anti-β2-M Ab sensitizes prostate cancer cells to radiation treatment. Additionally, anti-β2-M Ab was able to prevent tumor growth in an immunocompetent spontaneous prostate cancer mouse model. Since bone metastasis is lethal, we used a bone xenograft model to test the ability of anti-β2-M Ab and radiation to block tumor growth in the bone. Combination treatment significantly prevented tumor growth in the bone xenograft model by inhibiting β2-M and inducing iron overload. In addition to radiation sensitive effects, inhibition of β2-M sensitized prostate cancer cells to chemotherapeutic agents.  Conclusion:   Since prostate cancer bone metastatic patients have high β2-M in the tumor tissue and in the secreted form, targeting β2-M with anti-β2-M Ab is a promising therapeutic agent.

Methods:   From two cohorts of consecutive prostate cancer patients diagnosed at one pathology ward in Turin, Italy, we selected 157 patients with available NTAT and followed them up for more than 14 years. We obtained DNA from NTAT in paraffin-embedded prostate tumour tissues and used probe real-time PCR to analyse methylation of the glutathione S-transferase (GSTP1) and adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene promoters.  Results:   Prevalence of APC and GSTP1 methylation in the NTAT was between 40 and 45%. It was associated with methylation in prostate tumour tissue for the same two genes as well as with a high Gleason score. The hazard ratio (HR) of prostate cancer mortality was 2.38 (95% confidence interval: 1.23-4.61) for APC methylation, and 2.92 (1.49-5.74) for GSTP1 methylation in NTAT. It changed to 1.91 (1.03-3.56) and 1.60 (0.80-3.19) after adjusting for Gleason score and methylation in prostate tumour tissue. Comparison of 2 vs. 0 methylated genes in NTAT revealed a HR of 4.30 (2.00-9.22), which decreased to 2.40 (1.15-5.01) after adjustment.

Human plasma kallikrein, encoded by the KLKB1 gene on locus 4q34-35, functions in the blood coagulation pathway, and in regulating blood pressure. The human tissue kallikrein and kallikrein-related peptidases (KLKs) have diverse expression patterns and physiological roles, including cancer-related processes such as cell growth regulation, angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA), the product of the KLK3 gene, is the most widely used biomarker in clinical practice today. A total of 15 KLKs are encoded by the largest contiguous cluster of protease genes in the human genome (19q13.3-13.4), which makes them ideal for evolutionary analysis of gene duplication events. Previous studies on the evolution of KLKs have traced mammalian homologs as well as a probable early origin of the family in aves, amphibia and reptilia. The aim of this study was to address the evolutionary and functional relationships between tissue KLKs and plasma kallikrein, and to examine the evolution of alternative splicing isoforms. Sequences of plasma and tissue kallikreins and their alternative transcripts were collected from the NCBI and Ensembl databases, and comprehensive phylogenetic analysis was performed by Bayesian as well as maximum likelihood methods. Plasma and tissue kallikreins exhibit high sequence similarity in the trypsin domain (>50%). Phylogenetic analysis indicates an early divergence of KLKB1, which groups closely with plasminogen, chymotrypsin, and complement factor D (CFD), in a monophyletic group distinct from trypsin and the tissue KLKs. Reconstruction of the earliest events leading to the diversification of the tissue KLKs is not well resolved, indicating rapid expansion in mammals. Alternative transcripts of each KLK gene show species-specific divergence, while examination of sequence conservation indicates that many annotated human KLK isoforms are missing the catalytic triad that is crucial for protease activity.""","""['Vassiliki Lila Koumandou', 'Andreas Scorilas']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Evolutionary history of tissue kallikreins.', 'Overview of tissue kallikrein and kallikrein-related peptidases in breast cancer.', 'Kallikrein-related peptidases (KLKs) as emerging therapeutic targets: focus on prostate cancer and skin pathologies.', 'Structure of plasma and tissue kallikreins.', 'Kallikrein-related peptidases (KLKs): a gene family of novel cancer biomarkers.', 'Early reduction of SARS-CoV-2-replication in bronchial epithelium by kinin B2 receptor antagonism.', 'Remodelling of the tumour microenvironment by the kallikrein-related peptidases.', 'Co-option of the same ancestral gene family gave rise to mammalian and reptilian toxins.', 'Differences in the Inhibitory Specificity Distinguish the Efficacy of Plant Protease Inhibitors on Mouse Fibrosarcoma.', 'An ancient, conserved gene regulatory network led to the rise of oral venom systems.']"""

The balance between the MMPs and their natural inhibitors (tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases; TIMP) seem to be an important factor related to its role. The purpose of this study was to evaluate polymorphisms in the MMP-3 and TIMP-3 genes for their associations with prostate cancer (PCa) risk in North Indians.  Materials and methods:   Genotypes were determined by PCR-RFLP (Polymerase Chain Reaction Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism) method in 150 PCa patients and 200 age matched controls of similar ethnicity.  Results:   We found significant association in the MMP-3(1171)5A/6A and TIMP-3 (1298) C/T polymorphism with PCa risk. Variant genotype (5A/5A) of MMP-3(1171)5A/6A polymorphism had a high PCa risk (p=0.037, OR=3.52, 95%CI=1.08-11.5). Individuals with TIMP-3 (1298) CT genotype as well as T allele showed reduced risk of PCa (p<0.001; OR=0.31; 95%CI=0.18-0.52, and p=0.001; OR=0.49; 95%CI=0.32-0.75). This effect was even more evident in case of T allele carrier (CT+TT) (p<0.001; OR=0.36; 95%CI=0.22-0.59). Overall no significant association was observed statistically in MMP-3 and TIMP-3 with any of the grading stages and smoking habits in PCa. Haplotype analysis of MMP-3 showed that A-5A-A was associated with three folds (OR=3.06; 95%CI=1.71-5.47; p<0.001) increased risk in PCa patients.  Conclusion:   This is the first reported association between polymorphisms in the MMP-3 and TIMP-3 gene and PCa risk and supports the hypothesis that the protease/antiprotease balance has an important role.

IGRT was delivered with 3D-conformal or intensity-modulated radiation therapy with a median dose of 77.4 Gy. For HDR-B, the whole pelvis received a median 46 Gy, and the prostate 2 implants of 9.5 Gy (n = 71), 10.5 Gy (n = 155), or 11.5 Gy (n = 56).  Results:   Median followup was 3.7 years for IGRT and 8.0 years for HDR-B (p < 0.001).

We propose a bioeffect model may be used to target an ablative dose to the tumor with a lower, therapeutic dose to low-risk regions to maintain high rates of tumor control with reduced toxicity. We report on the validation of the model and derivation of the optimal cutpoint value of tumor control probability (TCP) that predicts for freedom from biochemical failure.  Methods and materials:   The TCP was calculated from postimplant dosimetry data for 423 prostate cancer patients from three Australian institutions. To apply the model, the prostate was mathematically divided into 12 subsections with tumor characteristics, including a nonuniform distribution of tumor cell density, derived from the literature.  Results:   When TCP values were above and below 0.62, the 5-year freedom from biochemical failure were 93.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 90.4, 96.4%) and 88.8% (95% confidence interval, 81.3, 94.5%), respectively (p = 0.004).  Conclusions:   Using postimplant dosimetry data, the TCP model was able to predict for freedom from biochemical failure.

DU145 treated with 1μM of 2d for 72h showed p21(Cip1) induction and suppression of Akt signaling together with induction of Rb. From a computational point of view, two different approaches were used in order to study topology and electronic properties of the novel compounds and to shed light on their drug-likeness properties.

Atrasentan, an endothelin receptor antagonist, has shown activity in prostate cancer. We therefore assessed its effect on survival in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer with bone metastases.  Methods:   In a double-blind phase 3 trial, men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, stratified for progression type (prostate-specific antigen or radiological), baseline pain, extraskeletal metastases, and bisphosphonate use, were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to docetaxel (75 mg/m(2) every 21 days, intravenously) with atrasentan (10 mg/day, orally) or placebo for up to 12 cycles and treated until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who did not progress on treatment were permitted to continue atrasentan or placebo for up to 52 weeks. Coprimary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00134056.  Findings:   498 patients were randomly assigned to the atrasentan group and 496 to the placebo group. The trial was halted early for futility in April, 2011, after a planned interim analysis. Median PFS was 9·2 months (95% CI 8·5-9·9) in the atrasentan group and 9·1 months (8·4-10·2) in the placebo group (hazard ratio 1·02, 0·89-1·16; p=0·81). Median overall survival was 17·8 months (16·4-19·8) in the atrasentan group versus 17·6 months (16·4-20·1) in the placebo group (1·04, 0·90-1·19; p=0·64). 278 (57%) of 492 patients in the atrasentan group had grade 3 and greater toxicity compared with 294 (60%) of 486 in the placebo group (p=0·22). Three deaths in the atrasentan group and seven in the placebo group were judged to be possibly or probably due to protocol treatment.  Interpretation:   Atrasentan, when added to docetaxel, does not improve overall survival or PFS in men with castration-resistant prostate cancer and bone metastases; therefore, single-agent docetaxel should remain as one of the standard treatments.

Methods and materials:   Real-time intrafraction motion is observed with the Calypso 4-dimensional nonradioactive electromagnetic tracking system (Calypso Medical Technologies, Inc. Seattle, Washington). We report the results from a total of 1024 fractions from 31 prostate cancer patients. Wavelet transform was used to decompose the signal to extract and isolate the respiratory-induced prostate motion from the total prostate displacement.  Results:   Our results show that the average respiratory motion larger than 0.5 mm can be observed in 68% of the fractions. Fewer than 1% of the patients showed average respiratory motion of less than 0.2 mm, whereas 99% of the patients showed average respiratory-induced motion ranging between 0.2 and 2 mm. The maximum respiratory range of motion of 3 mm or greater was seen in only 25% of the fractions. In addition, about 2% patients showed anxiety, indicated by a breathing frequency above 24 times per minute.  Conclusions:   Prostate motion is influenced by respiration in most fractions. Real-time intrafraction data are sensitive enough to measure the impact of respiration by use of wavelet decomposition methods. Although the average respiratory amplitude observed in this study is small, this technique provides a tool that can be useful if one moves to smaller treatment margins (≤5 mm). This also opens ups the possibility of being able to develop patient specific margins, knowing that prostate motion is not unpredictable.""","""['Yuting Lin', 'Tian Liu', 'Xiaofeng Yang', 'Yuenan Wang', 'Mohammad K Khan']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['The non-Gaussian nature of prostate motion based on real-time intrafraction tracking.', 'Effect of intrafraction prostate motion on proton pencil beam scanning delivery: a quantitative assessment.', 'Determination of Intrafraction Prostate Motion During External Beam Radiation Therapy With a\xa0Transperineal 4-Dimensional Ultrasound Real-Time Tracking System.', 'Toward submillimeter accuracy in the management of intrafraction motion: the integration of real-time internal position monitoring and multileaf collimator target tracking.', 'Relationship of imaging frequency and planning margin to account for intrafraction prostate motion: analysis based on real-time monitoring data.', 'Evaluating the potential benefit of reduced planning target volume margins for low and intermediate risk patients with prostate cancer using real-time electromagnetic tracking.', 'A system to use electromagnetic tracking for the quality assurance of brachytherapy catheter digitization.']"""

However, attention has been drawn to the safety of using high levels of soy isoflavones in humans, which is especially the concern for consumers taking regular soy isoflavone dietary supplements. The main objective of this study is thus to identify a soy isoflavone combination with lower levels of daidzein and genistein to be a more efficacious and safer chemo-preventive agent for PCa. The anticancer effects of daidzein and genistein, and their combinations on early-stage androgen-dependent PCa cells (LNCaP) and bone metastatic LNCaP-derivative PCa cells (C4-2B) were compared. Cells were treated with varying concentrations of daidzein, genistein (25-200 μM) or their combinations (25 or 50 μM) and cell proliferation, apoptosis, cell cycles and cellular uptakes of the isoflavones were measured after 48 h. Daidzein and genistein showed a synergistic effect on inhibiting cell proliferation and inducing apoptosis of both PCa cells. Twenty-five μM daidzein/50 μM genistein and 50 μM daidzein/50 μM genistein significantly increased the apoptotic effects on C4-2B cells although they did not show any effect when used individually. Except 50 μM daidzein/50 μM genistein, all other combinations had no impacts on cell cycles. For treatment with soy isoflavone combination, genistein was always better taken up than daidzein by both LNCaP and C4-2B cells.""","""['Xin Dong', 'Wenqing Xu', 'Robert A Sikes', 'Changqing Wu']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Food Chem""","""['Apoptotic effects of cooked and in vitro digested soy on human prostate cancer cells.', 'Soy isoflavones augment the effect of TRAIL-mediated apoptotic death in prostate cancer cells.', 'Differential effects of whole soy extract and soy isoflavones on apoptosis in prostate cancer cells.', 'Mechanisms underlying the dualistic mode of action of major soy isoflavones in relation to cell proliferation and cancer risks.', 'Soy isoflavone genistein in prevention and treatment of prostate cancer.', 'Microbial Community Variations and Bioconversion Improvements during Soybean-Based Fermentation by Kefir Grains.', 'Soybean (Glycine max) isoflavone conjugate hydrolysing β-glucosidase (GmICHG): a promising candidate for soy isoflavone bioavailability enhancement.', 'The Involvement of Natural Polyphenols in Molecular Mechanisms Inducing Apoptosis in Tumor Cells: A Promising Adjuvant in Cancer Therapy.', 'Chemopreventive Potential of Dietary Nanonutraceuticals for Prostate Cancer: An Extensive Review.', 'Enhanced total flavonoid accumulation and alleviated growth inhibition of germinating soybeans by GABA under UV-B stress.']"""

Certain single-nucleotide-polymorphisms have been found to correlate with PCa risk; however uncertainty remains regarding their clinical utility and how to best incorporate this information into clinical decision-making. Genetic testing is available directly to consumers and both patients and healthcare providers are becoming more aware of this technology. Purchasing online allows patients to bypass their healthcare provider yet patients may have difficulty interpreting test results and providers may be called upon to interpret results. Determining optimal ways to educate both patients and providers, and strategies for appropriately incorporating this information into clinical decision-making are needed.  Methods:   A mixed-method study was conducted in Utah between October 2011 and December 2011. Eleven focus group discussions were held and surveys were administered to 23 first-degree relatives of PCa patients living in Utah and 24 primary-care physicians and urologists practicing in Utah to present specific information about these assessments and determine knowledge and attitudes regarding health implications of using these assessments.  Results:   Data was independently coded by two researchers (relative Kappa = .88; provider Kappa = .77) and analyzed using a grounded theory approach. Results indicated differences in attitudes and behavioral intentions between patient and provider. Despite the test's limitations relatives indicated interest in genetic testing (52%) while most providers indicated they would not recommend the test for their patients (79%). Relatives expected providers to interpret genetic test results and use results to provide personalized healthcare recommendations while the majority of providers did not think the information would be useful in patient care (92%) and indicated low-levels of genetic self-efficacy.

In particular, the ability of saponins to enhance the cytotoxicity of chemotherapeutic drugs opened perspectives for their application in combined cancer chemotherapy. Here, we used human prostate cancer DU-145 cells as an in vitro model to elucidate the synergy of the interactions between biological activities of an oleanane type 13β,28-epoxy triterpene saponoside (Lclet 4) and mitoxantrone, which is a cytostatic drug commonly used in prostate cancer therapy. No cytotoxic or pro-apoptotic effect of Lclet 4 and mitoxantrone administered at the concentrations between 0.05 and 0.1 µg/ml could be seen. In contrast, cocktails of these agents exerted synergistic pro-apoptotic effects, accompanied by the activation of the caspase 3/7 system. This effect was paralleled by attenuating effects of Lclet 4/mitoxantrone cocktails on the invasive potential, metalloproteinase expression and motility of DU-145 cells. Multifaceted and additive effects of Lclet 4 and mitoxantrone on basic cellular traits crucial for prostate cancer progression indicate that the combined application of both agents at systemically neutral concentrations may provide the basis for new promising strategies of prostate cancer chemotherapy.""","""['Paulina Koczurkiewicz', 'Irma Podolak', 'Katarzyna Anna Wójcik', 'Agnieszka Galanty', 'Zbigniew Madeja', 'Marta Michalik', 'Jarosław Czyż']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Acta Biochim Pol""","""['Synergistic Cytotoxic and Anti-invasive Effects of Mitoxantrone and Triterpene Saponins from Lysimachia ciliata on Human Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Triterpene saponosides from Lysimachia ciliata differentially attenuate invasive potential of prostate cancer cells.', 'A triterpene saponin from Lysimachia thyrsiflora L.', 'Multidirectional effects of triterpene saponins on cancer cells - mini-review of in vitro studies.', 'Saponins as chemosensitizing substances that improve effectiveness and selectivity of anticancer drug-Minireview of in vitro studies.', 'Saponin Fraction CIL1 from Lysimachia ciliata L.

DP regulated the expression of Bcl-2 and Bax, which were mitochondrial pathway proteins, to decrease MMP, and DP promoted the transcription of Bax and inhibited Bcl-2. Apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) and cytochrome c which localized in mitochondrial in physiological condition were released into cytoplasm when MMP was decreased. DP activated caspase-9, which was the downstream of mitochondrial pathway.

Main strategies to ablate AR function are androgen depletion and direct receptor blockade by AR antagonists. However, incurable castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) develops resistance mechanisms to cope with trace amounts of androgen including AR overexpression and mutation in the AR ligand binding domain.  Methods:   The CRPC cell model VCaP derivative of a prostate cancer bone metastasis was used in vitro and in nude mice in vivo to examine the effects of immediate testosterone boost on CRPC cells. In addition, a testosterone tolerant cell model was established by incremental acclimatization of VCaP cells to 1 nM testosterone. The effects of androgen withdrawal and testosterone boosts on gene expression were assessed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, ELISA, and Western blots. Tumor cell proliferation was evaluated with a BrdU test.  Results:   Testosterone boosts on CRPC VCaP cells eliminate tumor cells to a higher extent than androgen withdrawal in androgen tolerant cells. The pronounced decrease of tumor cell proliferation was accompanied by a marked downregulation of AR expression regarding full-length AR and splice variant AR V7.

We evaluated whether these SNPs can independently predict outcomes of prostate biopsy, and improve the predictive performance of existing clinical variables.  Methods:   Three hundred eight consecutive patients that underwent prostate biopsy for detection of PCa at Huashan Hospital, Shanghai, China between April 2011 and August 2012 were recruited. Clinical variables such as serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels and peripheral blood samples were collected prior to a 10-core biopsy. A genetic score based on these 24 PCa associated SNPs was calculated for each individual.  Results:   Among 308 patients underwent prostate biopsy, 141 (45.8%) were diagnosed with PCa. Genetic score was significantly higher in patients with PCa (median = 1.30) than without (median = 0.89), P = 3.81 × 10(-6). The difference remained significant after adjusting for age and total PSA, P = 0.007. The PCa detection rate increased with increasing genetic score; 26.3%, 43.2%, and 60.0% for men with lower (<0.5), average (0.5-1.5), and higher (>1.5) genetic score, respectively, P(-trend) = 0.0003. For patients with moderately elevated PSA levels (1.6-20 ng/ml), the PCa detection rate was 31.2% overall and was 16.7%, 31.2%, and 40.9% for men with lower (<0.5), average (0.5-1.5), and higher (>1.5) genetic score, respectively, P(-trend) = 0.03. For patients with PSA ≥ 20 ng/ml, however, the PCa detection rates were high (>69%) regardless of genetic score.

This service implements recommendations outlined by the National Cancer Control Programme. The RAPAC was introduced at Galway University Hospital, Galway, Ireland in June 2009, aiming to structure GP referral of patients with suspected prostate cancer to a urology service.  Aims:   The aims of this study are to assess our initial experience with particular emphasis on access times, patient demographics, detection rates and treatment outcomes.  Methods:   Data on all patients presenting to the RAPAC during the preliminary 2-year period have been gathered prospectively and analysed using standard parametric analysis methods.  Results:   A total of 1,106 patients were reviewed at 278 clinic sessions during the initial 2-year period. The average waiting time to first clinic visit was 18 days (12-39 days). The mean age of referral to the clinic is 65 years (44-88 years). The mean PSA is 16.31 g/dL (0.4-845 g/dL). Of the 1106 patients undergoing TRUS biopsies, 503 (45.5 %) patients were diagnosed with prostate cancer. Further analysis patient demographics and cancer grading is presented in the article. Seventy-one patients (14.1 %) underwent radical retropubic prostatectomy. Sixty-seven patients (13.3 %) are being followed on an active monitoring programme, whilst 235 (56.7 %) received primary treatment with external beam radiotherapy and 68 (13.5 %) received brachytherapy.

A total of 135 adenomas (65 left colon and 70 right colon) were profiled for epigenome-wide DNA methylation using the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. A principal components analysis was performed to examine the association between variability in DNA methylation and adenoma location. Linear regression and linear mixed effects models were used to identify locus-specific differential DNA methylation in adenomas of right and left colon. A significant association was present between the first principal component and adenoma location (P=0.007), even after adjustment for subject age and gender (P=0.009). A total of 168 CpG sites were differentially methylated between right- and left-colon adenomas and these loci demonstrated enrichment of homeobox genes (P=3.0 × 10(-12)). None of the 168 probes were associated with CIMP genes. Among CpG loci with the largest difference in methylation between right- and left-colon adenomas, probes associated with PRAC (prostate cancer susceptibility candidate) gene showed hypermethylation in right-colon adenomas whereas those associated with CDX2 (caudal type homeobox transcription factor 2) showed hypermethylation in left-colon adenomas. A subgroup of left-colon adenomas enriched for current smokers (OR=6.1, P=0.004) exhibited a methylation profile similar to right-colon adenomas.

In vivo replication of oHSV-NIS in tumors was noninvasively monitored by computed tomography/single-photon emission computed tomography imaging of the biodistribution of pertechnetate and was confirmed. LNCap xenografts in nude mice were eradicated by intratumoral administration of oHSV-NIS. Systemic administration of oHSV-NIS prolonged the survival of tumor-bearing mice, and the therapeutic effect was further enhanced by administration of (131)I after the intratumoral spread of the virus had peaked. oHSV-NIS has the potential to substantially enhance the outcomes of standard therapy for patients with prostate cancer.""","""['H Li', 'H Nakashima', 'T D Decklever', 'R A Nace', 'S J Russell']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Cancer Gene Ther""","""['Oncolytic vaccinia virus as a vector for therapeutic sodium iodide symporter gene therapy in prostate cancer.', 'Noninvasive imaging and radiovirotherapy of prostate cancer using an oncolytic measles virus expressing the sodium iodide symporter.', 'Preclinical efficacy of the oncolytic measles virus expressing the sodium iodide symporter in iodine non-avid anaplastic thyroid cancer: a novel therapeutic agent allowing noninvasive imaging and radioiodine therapy.', 'Replication and Spread of Oncolytic Herpes Simplex Virus in Solid Tumors.', 'The use of the NIS reporter gene for optimizing oncolytic virotherapy.', 'Atrx deletion impairs CGAS/STING signaling and increases sarcoma response to radiation and oncolytic herpesvirus.', 'Vaccinia virus and peptide-receptor radiotherapy synergize to improve treatment of peritoneal carcinomatosis.', 'Selective sodium iodide symporter (NIS) genetherapy of glioblastoma mediatedby EGFR-targeted lipopolyplexes.', 'The Evolution and Future of Targeted Cancer Therapy: From Nanoparticles, Oncolytic Viruses, and Oncolytic Bacteria to the Treatment of Solid Tumors.', 'Evolving Role of Oncolytic Virotherapy: Challenges and Prospects in Clinical Practice.']"""

Herein, we identify the receptor activity-modifying protein 1 (RAMP1) as a direct NKX3.1 target gene through analysis of chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled to massively parallel sequencing and gene expression data. RAMP1 is a coreceptor for certain G-protein-coupled receptors, such as the calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor, to the plasma membrane. We found that RAMP1 expression is specifically elevated in human prostate cancer relative to other tumor types. Furthermore, RAMP1 mRNA and protein levels are significantly higher in human prostate cancer compared with benign glands. We identified multiple NKX3.1 binding sites in the RAMP1 locus in human prostate cancer cells and in the normal mouse prostate. Analyses of Nkx3.1 knockout mice and human prostate cancer cell lines indicate that NKX3.1 represses RAMP1 expression. Knockdown of RAMP1 by shRNA decreased prostate cancer cell proliferation and tumorigenicity in vitro and in vivo. By using gene expression profiling and pathway analyses, we identified several cancer-related pathways that are significantly altered in RAMP1 knockdown cells, including the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway. Further experiments confirmed a reduction in MAP2KI (MEK1) expression and phosphorylated-extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 levels in RAMP1 knockdown cells.

In particular, the snoRNA U50, mediating the methylation of C2848 in 28S rRNA, has been suggested as a potential tumor suppressor-like gene playing a role in breast and prostate cancers and B-cell lymphoma. Indeed, we observed the downregulation of U50 in colon cancer cell lines as well as tumors. We then investigated the relationship between U50 and proliferation in lymphocytes stimulated by phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and observed a strong decrease in U50 levels associated with a reduced C2848 methylation. This reduction was due to an alteration of U50 stability and to an increase of its consumption. Indeed, the blockade of ribosome biogenesis induced only an early decrease in U50 followed by a stabilization of U50 levels when ribosome biogenesis was almost completely blocked. Similar results were found with other snoRNAs. Lastly, we observed that U50 modulation affects ribosome efficiency in IRES-mediated translation, demonstrating that changes in the methylation levels of a single specific site on 28S rRNA may alter ribosome function. In conclusion, our results link U50 to the cellular proliferation rate and ribosome biogenesis and these findings may explain why its levels are often greatly reduced in cancers.""","""['Annalisa Pacilli', 'Claudio Ceccarelli', 'Davide Treré', 'Lorenzo Montanaro']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Int J Mol Sci""","""['Small Nucleolar Noncoding RNA SNORA23, Up-Regulated in Human Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma, Regulates Expression of Spectrin Repeat-Containing Nuclear Envelope 2 to Promote Growth and Metastasis of Xenograft Tumors in Mice.', 'Arabidopsis small nucleolar RNA monitors the efficient pre-rRNA processing during ribosome biogenesis.', 'Generation of a mouse model with down-regulated U50 snoRNA (SNORD50) expression and its organ-specific phenotypic modulation.', 'Tuning the ribosome: The influence of rRNA modification on eukaryotic ribosome biogenesis and function.', ""The role of OncoSnoRNAs and Ribosomal RNA 2'-O-methylation in Cancer."", 'The emerging role of snoRNAs in human disease.', 'SnoRNA and lncSNHG: Advances of nucleolar small RNA host gene transcripts in anti-tumor immunity.', 'Dysregulation of Small Nucleolar RNAs in B-Cell Malignancies.', 'Small nucleolar RNAs and SNHGs in the intestinal mucosal barrier: Emerging insights and current roles.', 'snoRNAs: functions and mechanisms in biological processes, and roles in tumor pathophysiology.']"""

In this study, we used a dissociated prostate tissue recombination system to interrogate the role of interleukin 6 (IL6) and the related cytokine oncostatin-M (OSM) in the initiation and progression of prostate cancer. We identified that prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) lesions induced by PTEN loss of function (PTEN(LOF)) progress to invasive adenocarcinoma following paracrine expression of either cytokine. Increased expression of OSM was also able to drive progression of benign human epithelium when combined with constitutively activated AKT. Malignant progression in the mouse was associated with invasion into the surrounding mesenchyme and increased activation of STAT3 in PTEN(LOF) grafts expressing IL6 or OSM. Collectively, our work indicates that pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL6 or OSM could activate pathways associated with prostate cancer progression and synergize with cell-autonomous oncogenic events to promote aggressive malignancy.

Purpose:   The purpose of this study was to assess men's awareness of the new recommendation, and their responses to it.  Methods:   This study comprised a web survey of men aged 40-74 years that was conducted through GfK Custom Research, LLC's Knowledge Panel® from November 22 to December 2, 2011. Chi-square tests and logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify factors associated with disagreement with and intention to follow the recommendation. Data were analyzed in March 2012.  Results:   The survey sample included 1089 men without a history of prostate cancer. After reviewing the recommendation, 62% agreed with the recommendation. Age and worry about getting prostate cancer were significantly related to disagreement with the recommendation. Only 13% of respondents were intenders (they planned to follow the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation and not get a prostate-specific antigen test in the future); 54% were non-intenders (they planned to not follow the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation and get a prostate-specific antigen test in the future; and 33% were undecided. Black race, higher income, having a PSA test in the past 2 years, and being somewhat/very worried about getting prostate cancer were all positively associated with being a non-intender.  Conclusions:   Study findings suggest that consumers are favorably disposed to PSA testing, despite new evidence suggesting that the harms outweigh the benefits.

Materials and methods:   In total 53 patients with prostata cancer (PCa) were included, who received a radical prostatectomy after multiparametric MRI of the prostate including DCE-MRI. Using circular regions of interests normal peripheral zone (PZ) and PCa foci > 5 mm in diameter (42 and 34 foci in Gd-DTPA and gadobutrol group, respectively) were analysed in DCE-MRI. Enhancement curves (Type I, II and III) and pharmacokinetic parameters were analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively and compared using mixed linear models (two sided p-values < 0.05 were regarded significant).  Results:   There was no significant difference in frequencies of curve types I, II or III in the normal PZ (p = 0.63) or in PCa foci (p = 0.75). PCa with a Gleason score ≥ 7 had in comparison to Gleason ≤ 6 significantly more often a Wash-Out-curve (Type III) with both CM (p = 0.02).

Alternative treatment options include thermal ablation strategies such as high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU).  Patients and methods:   96 patients with low-risk PCa (D'Amico) were treated at 2 HIFU centres with different expertise (n=48, experienced centre Lyon/France; n=48 inexperienced centre Charité Berlin/Germany). Matched pairs were formed and analysed with regard to biochemical disease-free survival (BDFS) as well as postoperative functional parameters (micturition, erectile function). The matched pairs were discriminated as to whether they had received HIFU treatment alone or a combination of HIFU with transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). Patients of the Lyon group were retrospectively matched through the @-registry database whereas patients of the Berlin group were prospectively evaluated. In the latter patients quality of life assessment was additionally inquired.  Results:   Postoperative PSA-Nadir was lower in the Berlin group for patients with HIFU only (0.007 vs. Lyon 0.34 ng/ml; p=0.037) and HIFU+TURP (0.25 vs. Lyon 0.42 ng/ml; p=0.003). BDFS was comparable in both groups for HIFU only (Berlin 4.77, Lyon 5.23 years; p=0.741) but patients with combined HIFU+TURP in the Berlin group showed an unfavourable BDFS as compared to the Lyon group (Berlin 3.02, Lyon 4.59 years; p=0.05). In an analysis of Berlin subgroups especially patients who had received HIFU and TURP (n=4) within the same narcosis had an unfavourable BDFS (p=0.009). Median follow-up was 3.36 years for HIFU only and 2.26 years for HIFU+TURP. Neither HIFU only (p=0.117) nor HIFU+TURP (p=0.131) showed an impact on postoperative micturition. Erectile function was negatively influenced (HIFU: p=0.04; HIFU+TURP: p=0.036). There was no measurable change in quality of life after the treatment.  Conclusion:   The 4-year BDFS after HIFU and HIFU+TURP is comparable to that of the standard therapies. The erectile function is sustainably negatively influenced whereas postoperative micturition and quality of life were not affected by HIFU or HIFU+TURP. These results are strongly limited by the low patient count and the short follow-up period and require validation in prospective multicentre studies with higher number of cases.""","""['D Baumunk', 'C Andersen', 'U Heile', 'J Ebbing', 'H Cash', 'M Porsch', 'U-B Liehr', 'A Janitzky', 'J J Wendler', 'D Schindele', 'S Blaschke', 'K Miller', 'M Schostak']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Aktuelle Urol""","""['Evolution and outcomes of 3 MHz high intensity focused ultrasound therapy for localized prostate cancer during 15 years.', 'Single application of high-intensity focused ultrasound as a first-line therapy for clinically localized prostate cancer: 5-year outcomes.', 'PSA nadir is a significant predictor of treatment failure after high-intensity focussed ultrasound (HIFU) treatment of localised prostate cancer.', 'High-intensity focused ultrasound for the treatment of localized prostate cancer: 5-year experience.', 'High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) for definitive treatment of prostate cancer.', 'Whole-gland high-intensity focused ultrasound ablation and transurethral resection of the prostate in the patients with prostate cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Magnetic resonance imaging-guided transurethral ultrasound ablation of prostate tissue in patients with localized prostate cancer: single-center evaluation of 6-month treatment safety and functional outcomes of intensified treatment parameters.', 'Bortezomib sensitizes thyroid cancer to BRAF inhibitor in vitro and in vivo.', 'Single high intensity focused ultrasound session as a whole gland primary treatment for clinically localized prostate cancer: 10-year outcomes.', 'Primary Zonal High Intensity Focused Ultrasound for Prostate Cancer: Results of a Prospective Phase IIa Feasibility Study.']"""

To date, many studies have evaluated associations between the CYP17 MspA1 polymorphism and prostate cancer risk; however, the results were controversial. Therefore, the aim of this study was to perform a meta-analysis to investigate the association between the CYP17 MspA1 polymorphism and the risk of prostate cancer.  Material and methods:   By searching the Pubmed, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, EBSCO databases, 36 studies including 14 494 cases and 15 971 controls were collected.

Results:   The overall results showed no significant association between the CYP17 MspA1 polymorphism and the risk of prostate cancer (OR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.92-1.25 for A2/A2 vs. A1/A1; OR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.92-1.12 for A1/A2 vs. A1/A1; OR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.94-1.22 for A2/A2 vs. A1/A2+A1/A1; OR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.93-1.14 for A1/A2+A2/A2 vs. A1/A1). In the stratified analysis according to ethnicity, no significant associations were observed in Asian, European, and African populations in all genetic models. In the stratified analysis by the source of controls and inpatients were found to have an increased risk of prostate cancer in all genetic models.

Here, we show that cell cycle and apoptosis regulator 1 (CCAR1) functions as an AR co-activator. CCAR1 interacted with and enhanced the transcriptional activity of AR. Depletion of CCAR1 caused reduction in androgen-dependent expression of a subset of AR target genes. We further showed that CCAR1 is required for recruitment of AR, MED1 and RNA polymerase II to the enhancers of AR target genes and for androgen-induced long-range prostate specific antigen enhancer-promoter interaction. The molecular mechanism underlying CCAR1 function in AR-mediated transcription involves CCAR1-mediated enhanced recruitment of GATA2, a pioneer factor for AR, to AR-binding sites. CCAR1 stabilized the interaction between AR and GATA2 by interacting directly with both proteins, thereby facilitating AR and GATA2 occupancy on the enhancers. Furthermore, CCAR1 depletion inhibited the growth, migration, invasion of prostate cancer cells and reduced the tumorigenicity of prostate cancer cells in vivo.

Currently, a sufficient pathological distinction between patients requiring further treatment and those for which active surveillance remains an option is still lacking, which leads to the problem of overtreatment. Cell proliferation is routinely assessed by detecting Ki-67 antigen. While Ki-67 is expressed throughout the interphase of proliferating cells, phosphorylation of the chromatin constituent histone H3 occurs only during the late G2 phase and mitosis thus providing a more strict assessment of the mitotic activity. We undertook this study to test whether expression of the recently introduced proliferation marker phospho-histone H3 (pHH3) in prostate carcinoma tissue sections exhibits prognostic significance in comparison with Ki-67.  Methods:   Protein expression of pHH3 and Ki-67 was assessed on TMA consisting of paraffin-embedded tissue from men that had undergone radical prostatectomy. The analysis included triplicate tissue cores of a total of 339 tumor foci. Immunohistochemical staining of pHH3 and Ki-67 was performed and analyzed using Definiens imaging software.  Results:   Prostate cancer tissue exhibited a significantly higher frequency of pHH3-positive cells compared to benign prostate tissue. pHH3 expression was significantly correlated with Ki-67 expression. Furthermore, statistical analysis revealed positive correlation between pHH3 expression and PSA levels at diagnosis and in addition negatively correlated with overall survival. In contrast to Ki-67 staining, pHH3 expression did not correlate with Gleason grade.  Conclusion:   Our data point to a conceivable role of pHH3 as prognostic biomarker in prostate carcinoma.""","""['Michael Nowak', 'Maria A Svensson', 'Jessica Carlsson', 'Wenzel Vogel', 'Moritz Kebschull', 'Nicolas Wernert', 'Glen Kristiansen', 'Ove Andrén', 'Martin Braun', 'Sven Perner']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""World J Urol""","""['Prognostic relevance of proliferation markers (Ki-67, PHH3) within the cross-relation of ERG translocation and androgen receptor expression in prostate cancer.', 'Ki-67 expression is superior to mitotic count and novel proliferation markers PHH3, MCM4 and mitosin as a prognostic factor in thick cutaneous melanoma.', 'Ki-67 proliferation index but not mitotic thresholds integrates the molecular prognostic stratification of lower grade gliomas.', 'Paradoxical results obtained with Ki67-labeling and PHH3-mitosis index in glial tumors: a literature analysis.', 'Angiogenesis, p53, bcl-2 and Ki-67 in the progression of prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy.', 'The Complete Loss of p53 Expression Uniquely Predicts Worse Prognosis in Colorectal Cancer.', 'PBK Enhances Cellular Proliferation With Histone H3 Phosphorylation and Suppresses Migration and Invasion With CDH1 Stabilization in Colorectal Cancer.', 'Quantitative Assessment of Epithelial Proliferation in Rat Mammary Gland Using Artificial Intelligence Independent of Choice of Proliferation Marker.', 'Identification of Morphologic Criteria Associated with Biochemical Recurrence in Intraductal Carcinoma of the Prostate.', 'Prostate cancer.']"""

Accumulating evidence indicate that GRP78 is overexpressed in many cancer cell lines, and contributes to the invasion and metastasis in many human tumors. Besides, GRP78 upregulation is detected in response to different ER stress-inducing anticancer therapies, including photodynamic therapy (PDT). This study demonstrates that GRP78 mRNA and protein levels are elevated in response to PDT in various cancer cell lines. Stable overexpression of GRP78 confers resistance to PDT substantiating its cytoprotective role. Moreover, GRP78-targeting subtilase cytotoxin catalytic subunit fused with epidermal growth factor (EGF-SubA) sensitizes various cancer cells to Photofrin-mediated PDT. The combination treatment is cytotoxic to apoptosis-competent SW-900 lung cancer cells, as well as to Bax-deficient and apoptosis-resistant DU-145 prostate cancer cells. In these cells, PDT and EGF-SubA cytotoxin induce protein kinase R-like ER kinase and inositol-requiring enzyme 1 branches of UPR and also increase the level of C/EBP (CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein) homologous protein, an ER stress-associated apoptosis-promoting transcription factor. Although some apoptotic events such as disruption of mitochondrial membrane and caspase activation are detected after PDT, there is no phosphatidylserine plasma membrane externalization or DNA fragmentation, suggesting that in DU-145 cells the late apoptotic events are missing. Moreover, in SW-900 cells, EGF-SubA cytotoxin potentiates PDT-mediated cell death but attenuates PDT-induced apoptosis. In addition, the cell death cannot be reversed by caspase inhibitor z-VAD, confirming that apoptosis is not a major cell death mode triggered by the combination therapy. Moreover, no typical features of necrotic or autophagic cell death are recognized. Instead, an extensive cellular vacuolation of ER origin is observed. Altogether, these findings indicate that PDT and GRP78-targeting cytotoxin treatment can efficiently kill cancer cells independent on their apoptotic competence and triggers an atypical, non-apoptotic cell death.""","""['M Firczuk', 'M Gabrysiak', 'J Barankiewicz', 'A Domagala', 'D Nowis', 'M Kujawa', 'E Jankowska-Steifer', 'M Wachowska', 'E Glodkowska-Mrowka', 'B Korsak', 'M Winiarska', 'J Golab']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Cell Death Dis""","""['Low dose of GRP78-targeting subtilase cytotoxin improves the efficacy of photodynamic therapy in vivo.', 'Targeting the unfolded protein response in glioblastoma cells with the fusion protein EGF-SubA.', 'Design, purification and assessment of GRP78 binding peptide-linked Subunit A of Subtilase cytotoxic for targeting cancer cells.', 'Novel Aspects of the SubA Subunit of the Subtilase Cytotoxin.', 'Glucose regulated protein 78: a critical link between tumor microenvironment and cancer hallmarks.', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress in the Brain Tumor Immune Microenvironment.', 'Comparative Transcriptomics and Proteomics of Cancer Cell Lines Cultivated by Physiological and Commercial Media.', 'Bioprospecting the microbiome of Red Sea Atlantis II brine pool for peptidases and biosynthetic genes with promising antibacterial activity.', 'Targeting GRP78 enhances the sensitivity of HOS osteosarcoma cells to pyropheophorbide-α methyl ester-mediated photodynamic therapy via the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.', 'GRP78 in lung cancer.']"""

To explore this association, we compared tumour TNM characteristics among aspirin users with those among non-users.  Methods:   From the Swedish Cancer Register, we identified patients diagnosed with colorectal, lung, prostate and breast cancers between 2006 and 2009 and matched them to the Swedish Prescribed Drug Register to obtain information on low-dose aspirin use prior to diagnosis. Contingency table and logistic regression analyses were used to test for association and obtain odds ratios (ORs).  Results:   We identified 17,041 colorectal, 9766 lung, 29,770 prostate and 20,299 breast cancer patients. The proportion of low-dose aspirin users was ~26% among colorectal, lung and prostate cancer patients and ~14% among breast cancer patients. Adjusted for age, gender, education level and place of residence, low-dose aspirin use was associated with lower tumour extent (T) for colorectal and lung cancers (P<0.0001) but not for prostate and breast cancers. The adjusted OR of aspirin use for the T4 vs T1 categories was ~0.7 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.6-0.8). For all cancers, we found no evidence of association of aspirin use with nodal involvement (N). Except for a borderline result in prostate cancer (OR ~0.9; 95% CI 0.8-1.0), aspirin use was associated with a lower rate of metastatic disease (ORs ~0.6-0.8). Among the histological subgroups of lung cancer, significant differences in tumour extent were observed most clearly within the adenocarcinoma subgroup (OR ~0.6, 95% CI 0.5-0.8), although numbers of other subtypes were more limited; and there was a significant reduction of ~20-30% in the odds of metastasis among the aspirin users across the subgroups.

In ERG-negative and -positive prostate cancers, KPNA2 immunostaining was significantly associated with advanced pathological tumor stage (pT3b/pT4), high Gleason grade and early biochemical recurrence (P<0.0001 each). Multivariate analysis including all established prognostic criteria available after surgery revealed that the prognostic role of KPNA2 (P=0.001) was independent of high Gleason grade, advanced pathological tumor stage, high preoperative prostate-specific antigen level and positive surgical margin status (P<0.0001 each). The comparison of KPNA2 expression with deletions of PTEN, 5q21, 6q15 and 3p13 in ERG-positive and -negative cancers revealed a strong link to PTEN deletions in both subgroups (P<0.0001). In conclusion, the strong independent prognostic impact of KPNA2 expression raises the possibility that measurement of KPNA2 expression alone or in combination with other molecular parameters might possibly result in clinically useful information.

Materials and methods:   Eighty-seven consecutive patients (mean age, 65.0 years; mean prostate-specific antigen, 13.3 ng/mL) with at least one prior negative TRUS-guided biopsy and persistent suspicion of prostate cancer were included in this study. All patients underwent MRI-guided biopsy after a diagnostic multiparametric MRI examination at 1.5 Tesla. Specimens were immediately fixated and subsequently evaluated by an experienced uropathologist. Prostate cancer detection rates were calculated. Prostate cancer-positive and -negative cores were compared. Correlation between number of prior biopsies and presence of prostate cancer was evaluated.  Results:   Cancer detection rates for patients with one (n=24), two (n=25), three (n=18), and four or more (n=20) negative TRUS-guided biopsies were 29.2%, 40.0%, 66.7%, and 35.0%, respectively (P = 0.087). The median number of removed cores per patient was 3 (range, 1-8) without a significant difference between patients with and without cancer (P = 0.48). Thirty of 36 cancer patients were at intermediate or high risk according to the D´Amico clinical risk score. Eleven of 15 high risk cancers were localized in the transition zone (P = 0.002).  Conclusions:   This study demonstrates high cancer detection rates of MRI-guided biopsy independent of the number of previous TRUS-guided biopsies and the number of taken prostate cores.

Data were collected pre- and post-insertion and patients followed-up until definitively treated.  Results:   16 patients had the Spanner inserted following use of the Surveyor. All insertions were uncomplicated. 14 patients were able to void satisfactorily immediately post-insertion with a mean Qmax of 15.0 ml/s and post-void residual of 51.3 ml. No symptomatic infection was reported. The stents stayed in situ for a median of 10 days. 12 stents were removed prematurely due to severe symptoms or retention. A total of 12 stents had to be removed endoscopically.  Conclusions:   The Spanner is easy to insert. Stent removal via the retrieval suture has been difficult necessitating the use of endoscopy in the majority of cases. Possible causes of stent failure include underestimation of the prostatic urethral length by the Surveyor leading to obstruction by apical prostatic tissue, excessive suture length between the stent and distal anchor permitting proximal migration or inadequate suture length leading to urinary incontinence.

Methods and materials:   From an institutional cohort of 575 patients treated with SRT, data on MTD were retrospectively collected. The impact of MTD on biochemical failure (BF), metastasis, and prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM) was assessed on univariate and multivariate analysis using Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards models.  Results:   In the 173 patients with MTD data available, median follow-up was 77 months (interquartile range, 47-104 months) after SRT, and median MTD was 18 mm (interquartile range, 13-22 mm). Increasing MTD correlated with increasing pT stage, Gleason score, presence of seminal vesicle invasion, and lymph node invasion. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis identified MTD of >14 mm to be the optimal cut-point. On univariate analysis, MTD >14 mm was associated with an increased risk of BF (P=.02, hazard ratio [HR] 1.8, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2-2.8), metastasis (P=.002, HR 4.0, 95% CI 2.1-7.5), and PCSM (P=.02, HR 8.0, 95% CI 2.9-21.8). On multivariate analysis MTD >14 mm remained associated with increased BF (P=.02, HR 1.9, 95% CI 1.1-3.2), metastasis (P=.02, HR 3.4, 95% CI 1.2-9.2), and PCSM (P=.05, HR 9.7, 95% CI 1.0-92.4), independent of extracapsular extension, seminal vesicle invasion, positive surgical margins, pre-RT PSA value, Gleason score, and pre-RT PSA doubling time.  Conclusions:   For patients treated with SRT for a rising PSA value after prostatectomy, MTD at time of radical prostatectomy is independently associated with BF, metastasis, and PCSM.

The effects of small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of TIM-3 (TIM-3 siRNA) in two human prostate cancer cell lines were also evaluated.  Results:   TIM-3 expression was higher in prostate cancer tissue than in the adjacent benign tissue (P<0.001). High TIM-3 expression was an independent predictor of both recurrence-free survival and progression-free survival. TIM-3 protein was expressed in both prostate cancer cell lines and knockdown suppressed their proliferation and invasion capacity.  Conclusions:   TIM-3 expression is associated with a poor prognosis in prostate cancer.

Material and methods:   From 1987 to 2004, 309 men (median age 62 years, range 40-74 years) were prostatectomized for localized prostate cancer at a tertiary referral cancer centre. Slightly modified D'Amico risk groups were identified. PSA relapse was defined as PSA ≥ 4 μg/l before 2000, and thereafter as PSA > 0.2 μg/l. Radical prostatectomy (RP) 3-12 months after diagnosis represented ""deferred"" RP. PCSM was assessed with competing risk modelling. The level of significance was set at p < 0.05.  Results:   After a median of 12 years, 41 men were dead from prostate cancer and 68 due to other causes [15-year PCSM 15%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 10-19%], with no significant difference in PCSM between the low- and intermediate-risk groups, and the ""conventional"" high-risk group having 24% PCSM (95% CI 16-32%).

Deferral of RP for up to 1 year had no impact on PCSM for all patients combined.  Conclusions:   Approximately one in seven men with localized prostate cancer, prostatectomized before the PSA era, will die from the disease within the 15 years post-RP.

Under pathological hypoxia, the catalytic activities of JMJD2A, JMJD2C and Jumonji/ARID domain-containing protein 1B (JARID1B) were blocked due to the lack of their substrate, i.e. oxygen. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses showed that hypoxia increased the appearance of H3K9me3 and H3K4me3, substrates of JMJD2s and JARID1B, respectively, in the PSA enhancer. In contrast, JMJD1A, which demethylates both H3K9me2 and H3K9me1, maintained its catalytic activity even under severe hypoxia. Furthermore, hypoxia increased the expression of JMJD1A. Hypoxia and androgen additively increased the recruitment of JMJD1A and p300 on the enhancer region of PSA through interaction with the hypoxia-inducible factor-1α and AR, both of which bind the PSA enhancer. Thus, hypoxia enhanced the demethylation of H3K9me2 and H3K9me1, leading to provide unmethylated H3K9 residues that are substrates for histone acetyltransferase, p300.

These can also be achieved by implementing in vitro and in vivo preclinical models by taking advantage of prostate cancer stem cells (PCSCs). The best-characterized mouse model of prostate cancer is the transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate (TRAMP) model. TRAMP mice develop a progressive lesion called prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia that evolves into adenocarcinoma (AD) between 24 and 30 weeks of age. ADs often metastasize to lymph nodes, lung, bones, and kidneys. Eventually, approximately 5% of the mice develop an androgen-independent neuroendocrine adenocarcinoma. Here we report the establishment of long-term self-renewing PCSC lines from the different stages of TRAMP progression by application of the neurosphere assay. Stage-specific prostate cell lines were endowed with the critical features expected from malignant bona fide cancer stem cells, namely, self-renewal, multipotency, and tumorigenicity. Notably, transcriptome analysis of stage-specific PCSCs resulted in the generation of well-defined, meaningful gene signatures, which identify distinct stages of human tumor progression.

Summary of background data:   rhBMP is commonly used to promote bone union after spinal surgery. BMP receptors are present on multiple cancer types, but the risk of cancer after receiving rhBMP has not been well studied.  Methods:   We identified 146,278 subjects aged 67 years and older who underwent surgery in 2003 to 2008 and were followed through 2010 for a new diagnosis of 1 of 26 cancers. Proportional hazards models were used to determine cancer risk associated with rhBMP use.  Results:   rhBMP was administered in 15.1% of the cohort. After an overall average follow-up of 4.7 years, 15.4% of rhBMP-treated and 17.0% of untreated patients had a new cancer diagnosis, with most commonly recorded types as prostate, breast, lung, and colorectal. In a multivariate proportional hazards model, there was no association of rhBMP with cancer risk (hazard ratio: 0.99, 95% confidence interval: 0.95-1.02). There was also no association of rhBMP with the risk of any individual cancer types. The results were consistent in analyses using 2 secondary definitions of incident cancer.

This study evaluated the long-term (>10 year) impact of PSMs on biochemical recurrence after RP in adjuvant treatment-naïve pT2-pT4 N0 men and determined predictors of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) failure.  Material and methods:   The institutional registry of 1276 patients who underwent RP at Henri Mondor Hospital from 1988 to 2001 was reviewed, identifying 403 patients with regular follow-up at the time of analysis. The study included 108 patients with PSMs who did not receive neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy before PSA relapse. Median follow-up was 12.2 years. PSA failure was defined by a PSA rising by more than 0.2 ng/ml and biochemical recurrence-free survival (RFS) was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to analyse clinicopathological variables associated with biochemical recurrence.  Results:   Biochemical recurrence 10 years after RP was 33.5% for patients regardless of the margin status. The 10-year biochemical RFS was 73% in men with negative margins compared to 49% in the case of PSM (p < 0.001). In multivariate analysis, margin status was a significantly predictive for PSA failure (hazard ratio 1.46, p = 0.04). After stratification by pathological stage, margin status was significantly predictive for biochemical RFS in pT2 (p < 0.001) and pT3a (p < 0.001), whereas the impact of PSM did not reach significance in pT3b (p = 0.16).

Besides, its enzymatic product-sarcosine has been recognized as a marker for prognosis of PCa. The goals of this study were to determine whether GNMT is regulated by androgen and to map its AREs (androgen response elements). Real-time PCR analyses showed that R1881, a synthetic AR (androgen receptor) agonist induced GNMT expression in AR-positive LNCaP cells, but not in AR-negative DU145 cells. In silico prediction showed that there are four putative AREs in GNMT-ARE1, ARE2 and ARE3 are located in the intron 1 and ARE4 is in the intron 2. Consensus ARE motif deduced from published AREs was used to identify the fifth ARE-ARE5 in the coding region of exon 1. Luciferase reporter assay found that only ARE5 mediated the transcriptional activation of R1881. ARE3 overlaps with a YY1 [Yin and Yang 1 (motif (CaCCATGTT, +1118/+1126)] that was further confirmed by antibody supershift and ChIP (chromatin immunoprecipitation) assays. EMSA (electrophoretic mobility shift assay) and ChIP assay confirmed that AR interacts with ARE5 in vitro and in vivo. In summary, GNMT is an AR-targeted gene with its functional ARE located at +19/+33 of the first exon.

Materials and methods:   The growth inhibition on PNT2, TRAMP-C1 and B16F10 cells in the combined treatments with bisphosphonates (zoledronic acid, ibandronate and pamidronate) and IR in the presence and absence of apigenin was studied using a cell viability test.  Results:   Zoledronic acid had a cytotoxic effect on PNT2, TRAMP-C1 and B16F10 cells (p<0.001). However, ibandronate and pamidronate had a cytotoxic effect only on PNT2 cells (p<0.001). The administration of apigenin in combined treatment with bisphosphonates and IR showed: a decrease in the cytotoxic effect on TRAMP-C1 and B16F10 cells in the treatment with ibandronate; a protective effect on normal PNT2 and melanoma cells, but not on TRAMP-C1 cells in the treatment with zoledronic acid; and provided protection only to PNT2 cells in the treatment with pamidronate.  Conclusion:   The use of the antioxidant produced a greater decrease in the cytotoxic effect on the non-tumor than in tumor cells when treated with bisphosphonates-alone and could be used in non-tumor pathologies.

The leucine-rich repeat containing G-protein-coupled receptors (Lgr) have been identified as important stem cell markers in various tissues. Here, we investigated the roles of Lgr4/Gpr48 in prostate stem cells (PSCs) and development. Lgr4 was ubiquitously expressed during early prostate development prior to lineage specification, with adult expression restricted to a few basal cells (principally Lin(-)Sca1(+)CD49f(+)). Lgr4(-/-) mice had compromised branching morphogenesis and delayed epithelial differentiation, leading to decreased prostate size and impaired luminal cell function. In vitro prostate sphere culture revealed that Lgr4(-/-) Lin(-)/Sca1(+)/CD49f(+) cells failed to generate p63(low) cells, indicating a differentiation deficiency. Furthermore, Lgr4 ablation arrested PSC differentiation of in vivo kidney capsule prostate grafts, suggesting that Lgr4 modulates PSC properties independent of hormonal and mesenchymal effects. Analysis of neonatal prostates and prostate spheres revealed a decrease in Wnt, Sonic Hedgehog, and Notch1 expression in Lgr4(-/-) cells. Lgr4 loss blocked differentiation of prostate sphere p63(hi) cells to p63(low). Treatment with exogenous Sonic Hedgehog partially restored the differentiation of p63(hi) cells in Lgr4(-/-) spheres.

The objective of this study was to determine what factors are associated with patients' participation or willingness to participate and whether these factors vary by race/ethnicity.  Design:   or  Methods:   . White, Hispanic, and black participants were obtained through the Florida cancer registry and who were diagnosed with breast, lung, colorectal, or prostate cancer (N = 1100). Participants were surveyed via telephone to obtain demographic information, past participation, and willingness to participate in clinical trials, as well as barriers and facilitators to participation. Logistic and Poisson regressions were performed.  Results:   . Respondents were on average 67.4 years old, 42.7% were male, and 50.1% were married. In this population, 7.7% of respondents had participated in a clinical trial, and 36.5% stated that they would be willing to participate. In multivariate models, blacks and Hispanics were equally likely as whites to be willing to participate in cancer trials, but Hispanics were less likely to have participated, and this was especially more likely in non-English-speaking Hispanics compared with English-speaking Hispanics. Notable barriers across race/ethnicity were mistrust and lack of knowledge of clinical trials. Limitations. Cross-sectional design limits cause-and-effect conclusions.  Conclusions:   . There are racial differences in participation rates but not in willingness to participate. We hypothesize that willingness to participate is not very high because people are uninformed about participating, particularly in non-English-speaking Hispanics. Barriers and facilitators to participation vary by race.

Objective:   To assess the effectiveness of 2 decision aids in helping men make informed PCa screening decisions.  Design, setting, and participants:   A racially diverse group of male outpatients aged 45 to 70 years from 3 sites were interviewed by telephone at baseline, 1 month, and 13 months, from 2007 through 2011. We conducted intention-to-treat univariate analyses and multivariable linear and logistic regression analyses, adjusting for baseline outcome measures.  Intervention:   Random assignment to print-based decision aid (n = 628), web-based interactive decision aid (n = 625), or usual care (UC) (n = 626).  Main outcomes and measures:   Prostate cancer knowledge, decisional conflict, decisional satisfaction, and whether participants underwent PCa screening.  Results:   Of 4794 eligible men approached, 1893 were randomized. At each follow-up assessment, univariate and multivariable analyses indicated that both decision aids resulted in significantly improved PCa knowledge and reduced decisional conflict compared with UC (all P <.001). At 1 month, the standardized mean difference (Cohen’s d) in knowledge for the web group vs UC was 0.74, and in the print group vs UC, 0.73. Decisional conflict was significantly lower for web vs UC (d = 0.33) and print vs UC (d = 0.36). At 13 months, these differences were smaller but remained significant. At 1 month, high satisfaction was reported by significantly more print (60.4%) than web participants (52.2%; P = .009) and significantly more web (P = .001) and print (P = .03) than UC participants (45.5%). At 13 months, differences in the proportion reporting high satisfaction among print (55.7%) compared with UC (49.8%; P = .06) and web participants (50.4%; P = .10) were not significant. Screening rates at 13 months did not differ significantly among groups.  Conclusions and relevance:   Both decision aids improved participants’ informed decision making about PCa screening up to 13 months later but did not affect actual screening rates.

Methods:   PubMed was reviewed for phase III randomized trials in patients with CRPC progressed after docetaxel chemotherapy. Characteristics of each study and the relative hazard ratio (HR) for overall survival and 95% confidence interval (CI) were collected. Summary HR was calculated using random- or fixed-effects models depending on the heterogeneity of included studies.  Results:   A total of 3,149 patients was available for meta-analysis. In the overall population, the experimental treatments decrease the risk of death by 31% (HR=0.69; 95% CI: 0.63-0.76; P<0.001).

Cytosine methylation of CpG-rich promoter DNA is an important mechanism of epigenetic gene inactivation in PCa. There is considerable amount of data to suggest that DNA methylation-based biomarkers may be useful for the early detection and diagnosis of PCa. In addition, candidate gene-based studies have shown an association between specific gene methylation and alterations and clinicopathologic indicators of poor prognosis in PCa.  Methods:   To more comprehensively identify DNA methylation alterations in PCa initiation and progression, we examined the methylation status of 485 577 CpG sites from regions with a broad spectrum of CpG densities, interrogating both gene-associated and non-associated regions using the recently developed Illumina 450K methylation platform.  Results:   In all, we selected 33 promoter-associated novel CpG sites that were differentially methylated in high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and PCa in comparison with benign prostate tissue samples (false discovery rate-adjusted P-value <0.05; β-value 0.2; fold change >1.5). Of the 33 genes, hierarchical clustering analysis demonstrated BNC1, FZD1, RPL39L, SYN2, LMX1B, CXXC5, ZNF783 and CYB5R2 as top candidate novel genes that are frequently methylated and whose methylation was associated with inactivation of gene expression in PCa cell lines. Pathway analysis of the genes with altered methylation patterns identified the involvement of a cancer-related network of genes whose activity may be regulated by TP53, MYC, TNF, IL1 and 6, IFN-γ and FOS in prostate pathogenesis.

Methods:   We studied the progression to CRPC for the SLCO1B3 rs4149117 and SLCO2B1 rs12422149 genotypes in 87 prostate cancer patients who received androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Data were analyzed using the χ(2) test, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox proportional hazard model.  Results:   SLCO3B1 genotypes were not significantly associated with the time to progression (TTP); however, patients carrying the active androgen transport SLCO2B1 genotype (GG allele) exhibited a median TTP that was 7 months shorter than that of patients with impaired androgen-transporting activity SLCO2B1 polymorphisms (GA/AA alleles) (10.0 vs 17.0 months, P=0.004). Active androgen transport genotypes of SLCO2B1 (GG allele) occurred more frequently in African and Caucasian populations than in Japanese and Han Chinese populations (P<0.001).  Conclusions:   These data suggest that SLCO2B1 rs12422149 variants could provide prognostic value for prostate cancer patients treated with ADT and influence ethnic differences in response to ADT.

Biomarkers of metabolic-symbiosis are excellent predictors of tumor recurrence, metastasis, and drug resistance, as well as poor patient survival. New pre-clinical models of metabolic-symbiosis have been generated and they genetically validate that catabolic fibroblasts promote tumor growth and metastasis. Over 30 different stable lines of catabolic fibroblasts and >10 different lines of anabolic cancer cells have been created and are well-characterized.

Taken together, these studies provide >40 novel validated targets, for new drug discovery and anti-cancer therapy. Since anabolic cancer cells amplify their capacity for oxidative mitochondrial metabolism, we should consider therapeutically targeting mitochondrial biogenesis and OXPHOS in epithelial cancer cells.

In an attempt to increase the effectiveness of diagnostic or radiotherapeutic agents, we have begun to explore the incorporation of the hypoxia-selective prodrug 2-nitroimidazole into receptor-targeted peptides. Hypoxia is a well-known characteristic of many solid tumors, including breast, prostate, and pancreatic cancers. The aim of this approach is to use the hypoxia-trapping capability of 2-nitroimidazoles to increase the retention of the agent in hypoxic, BB2r-positive tumors. We have demonstrated that incorporation of one or more 2-nitroimidazoles into the BB2r-targeted peptide significantly increases the in vitro retention of the agent in hypoxic prostate cancer cells. The study described herein represents our first investigation of the in vivo properties of these hypoxia-enhanced BB2r-targeted agents in a PC-3 xenograft mouse model.  Methods:   Four (111)In-labeled BB2r-targeted conjugates--(111) IN-1, (111) IN-2, (111) IN-3, and (111) IN-4, composed of 2-nitroimidazole moieties of 0, 1, 2, and 3, respectively--were synthesized, labeled, and purified. The BB2r binding affinities, externalization, and protein-association properties of these radioconjugates were assessed using the BB2r-positive PC-3 human prostate cancer cell line under hypoxic and normoxic environments. The in vivo biodistribution and micro-SPECT/CT imaging of the (111) IN-1, (111) IN-2, and (111) IN-4 radioconjugates were investigated in PC-3 tumor-bearing severely combined immunodeficient mice.  Results:   All conjugates and (nat)In-conjugates demonstrated nanomolar binding affinities. (111) IN-1, (111) IN-2, (111) IN-3, and (111) IN-4 demonstrated 41.4%, 60.7%, 69.1%, and 69.4% retention, correspondingly, of internalized radioactivity under hypoxic conditions relative to 34.8%, 35.3%, 33.2%, and 29.7% retention, respectively, under normoxic conditions. Protein-association studies showed significantly higher levels of association under hypoxic conditions for 2-nitroimidazole-containing BB2r-targeted radioconjugates than for controls. On the basis of the initial 1-h uptake in the PC-3 tumors, (111) IN-1, (111) IN-2, and (111) IN-4 demonstrated tumor retentions of 1.5%, 6.7%, and 21.0%, respectively, by 72 h after injection. Micro-SPECT/CT imaging studies of (111) IN-1, (111) IN-2, and (111) IN-4 radioconjugates resulted in clear delineation of the tumors.  Conclusion:   On the basis of the in vitro and in vivo studies, the BB2r-targeted agents that incorporated 2-nitroimidazole moieties demonstrated improved retention. These results indicate that further exploration into the potential of hypoxia-selective trapping agents for BB2r-targeted agents, as well as other targeted compounds, is warranted.""","""['Zhengyuan Zhou', 'Nilesh K Wagh', 'Sunny M Ogbomo', 'Wen Shi', 'Yinnong Jia', 'Susan K Brusnahan', 'Jered C Garrison']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""['Development of hypoxia enhanced 111In-labeled Bombesin conjugates: design, synthesis, and in vitro evaluation in PC-3 human prostate cancer.', 'Evaluation of the pharmacokinetic effects of various linking group using the 111In-DOTA-X-BBN(7-14)NH2 structural paradigm in a prostate cancer model.', 'Receptor-binding, biodistribution, dosimetry, and micro-SPECT/CT imaging of 111In-DTPA(1), Lys(3), Tyr(4)-bombesin analog in human prostate tumor-bearing mice.', 'Bombesin-Targeted PET of Prostate Cancer.', 'Gastrin releasing peptide (GRP) receptor targeted radiopharmaceuticals: a concise update.', 'Human Absorbed Dose Estimation of 111In-DOTA-PR81 as a Novel High Potential Agent for Breast Cancer Imaging.', 'Imaging of Tumor Hypoxia With Radionuclide-Labeled Tracers for PET.', 'Bombesin-functionalized superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles for dual-modality MR/NIRFI in mouse models of breast cancer.', 'Development of Improved Tumor-Residualizing, GRPR-Targeted Agents: Preclinical Comparison of an Endolysosomal Trapping Approach in Agonistic and Antagonistic Constructs.', 'Comparative Study of Subcutaneous and Orthotopic Mouse Models of Prostate Cancer: Vascular Perfusion, Vasculature Density, Hypoxic Burden and BB2r-Targeting Efficacy.']"""

Materials and methods:   We conducted a systematic search of several bibliographic systems to identify all RCTs of IADT in men with newly diagnosed metastatic or biochemical only prostate cancer. We abstracted outcome data, study characteristics, and participant demographics. We performed heterogeneity tests and calculated the summarized risk differences (RD) and risk ratios at 95% confidence intervals (CI), using inverse variance methods in random-effects approaches.  Results:   We identified 8 RCTs (N = 4664) comparing mortality between IADT and CADT. For all men combined, we observed small but nonsignificant differences in all-cause mortality (RD = 0.02, 95% CI = -0.02, 0.06), disease-specific mortality (RD = 0.04, 95% CI = -0.01, 0.08), and disease progression (RD = -0.03, 95% CI = -0.09, 0.04).

Aim:   The aim of the authors was to assess the reproducibility of Gleason grading among pathologists using the same needle biopsy samples.  Method:   23 pathologists examined 37 prostate cancer biopsies stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Gleason scores were categorised into 4 groups (2-4, 5-6, 7 and 8-10). Kappa statistics were used to reflect interobserver agreement.  Results:   Considering all participating pathologists, grouping into one of the 4 categories resulted in an overall kappa value of 0.49. For the individual categories, the worst agreement (kappa = 0.15) was seen with well differentiated carcinomas, and the best (kappa = 0.65) with poorly differentiated ones.  Conclusions:   These results suggest that Gleason grading in biopsy samples is moderately reproducible. The kappa values vary according to the differentiation of the cancer, and there is not much difference between the results of the present study and those published in the literature.

TCTP expression was previously shown to be deregulated in prostate cancer, but its function in prostate cancer cells is largely unknown. Here we show that TCTP expression is regulated by androgens in LNCaP prostate cancer cells in vitro as well as human prostate cancer xenografts in vivo. Knockdown of TCTP reduced colony formation and increased apoptosis in LNCaP cells, implicating it as an important factor for prostate cancer cell growth. Global gene expression profiling in TCTP knockdown LNCaP cells showed that several interferon regulated genes are regulated by TCTP, suggesting that it may have a role in regulating immune function in prostate cancer.

We searched for copy number variants in all KLK genes using quantitative PCR analysis and analysis of inheritance patterns of single nucleotide polymorphisms. Two deletions were identified: one 2235-bp deletion in KLK9 present in 1.2% of alleles, and one 3394-bp deletion in KLK15 present in 4.0% of alleles. Each deletion eliminated one complete exon and created out-of-frame coding that eliminated the catalytic triad of the resulting truncated gene product, which therefore likely is a non-functional protein. Deletion breakpoints identified by DNA sequencing located the KLK9 deletion breakpoint to a long interspersed element (LINE) repeated sequence, while the deletion in KLK15 is located in a single copy sequence. To search for an association between each deletion and risk of prostate cancer (PC), we analyzed a cohort of 667 biopsied men (266 PC cases and 401 men with no evidence of PC at biopsy) using short deletion-specific PCR assays. There was no association between evidence of PC in this cohort and the presence of either gene deletion. Haplotyping revealed a single origin of each deletion, with most recent common ancestor estimates of 3000-8000 and 6000-14 000 years for the deletions in KLK9 and KLK15, respectively. The presence of the deletions on the same haplotypes in 1000 Genomes data of both European and African populations indicate an early origin of both deletions.

Inhibition of NF-κB-dependent transcription was used as an anticancer strategy for the development of the first clinically approved 26S proteasome inhibitor, bortezomib (BZ). Even though BZ has shown remarkable antitumor activity in hematological malignancies, it has been less effective in prostate cancer and other solid tumors; however, the mechanisms have not been fully understood. In this article, we report that proteasome inhibition by BZ unexpectedly increases IL-8 expression in androgen-independent prostate cancer PC3 and DU145 cells, whereas expression of other NF-κB-regulated genes is inhibited or unchanged. The BZ-increased IL-8 expression is associated with increased in vitro p65 NF-κB DNA binding activity and p65 recruitment to the endogenous IL-8 promoter. In addition, proteasome inhibition induces a nuclear accumulation of IκB kinase (IKK)α, and inhibition of IKKα enzymatic activity significantly attenuates the BZ-induced p65 recruitment to IL-8 promoter and IL-8 expression, demonstrating that the induced IL-8 expression is mediated, at least partly, by IKKα.

This study was designed to systematically analyze molecular effects of systemic in vivo blockade of α1-adrenergic receptors (α1-ADRs) on stress-induced disturbance of cAMP/cGMP signaling in testosterone-producing Leydig cells using the following parameters (i) level of circulating stress hormones, LH and testosterone; (ii) level of main molecular markers of Leydig cell functionality (testosterone, Insl3, cAMP); (iii) expression of cAMP signaling (cAMP 'producers'/'effectors'/'removers') and (iv) expression of NO-cGMP signaling (NO-cGMP 'producers'/'effectors'/'removers'). The results showed that oral administration of α1-ADR blocker before stress increased cGMP and diminished stress-reduced cAMP production in Leydig cells. In the same cells, stress-induced effects on cAMP/cGMP signaling pathways elements were changed. Sustained in vivo α1-ADR blockade completely abolished stress-increased transcription of most abundantly expressed phosphodiesterase that remove cAMP (Pde4b) and potentiated stress-increased expression of PRKA, the main stimulator of Leydig cell steroidogenesis. In the same Leydig cells, stress-decreased NOS3 expression was abolished, while stress-increased GUCY1 (cGMP 'producer') and PRKG1 (cGMP 'effector') were potentiated. It is possible that all molecules mentioned could contribute, at least in part, in recovery of Leydig cell testosterone production. Presented data provide new role of α1-ADRs in stress-triggered disturbance of cAMP/cGMP signaling, and new molecular insights into the relationship between stress and mammalian reproduction.

In the regression model, total direct costs increased with age, comorbidity, and Gleason score (all P < 0.0001). Radical prostatectomy was the most costly primary treatment health state ($4676 per 100 days). Radical prostatectomy, hormone-refractory metastatic disease ($6398 per 100 days), and final (predeath) ($13,739 per 100 days) health states were significantly more costly (P < 0.05) than nontreated nonmetastatic PC ($3440 per 100 days), whereas the postprostatectomy ($732 per 100 days) and postradiation ($1556 per 100 days) states cost significantly less (P < 0.0001).  Conclusions:   This study used an innovative but labor-intensive approach linking chart and administrative data to estimate health care costs. Researchers should weigh the potential benefits of this method against what is involved in implementation. Modifications in methodology may achieve similar gains with less outlay in individual studies. However, we believe that this is a promising approach for researchers wishing to advance the quality of costing in state transition modeling.""","""['Murray D Krahn', 'Karen E Bremner', 'Brandon Zagorski', 'Shabbir M H Alibhai', 'Wendong Chen', 'George Tomlinson', 'Nicholas Mitsakakis', 'Gary Naglie']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Med Decis Making""","""['Patient time and out-of-pocket costs for long-term prostate cancer survivors in Ontario, Canada.', 'Economic evaluation of denosumab compared with zoledronic acid in hormone-refractory prostate cancer patients with bone metastases.', 'Healthcare costs associated with prostate cancer: estimates from a population-based study.', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA)-Based Population Screening for Prostate Cancer: An Economic Analysis.', 'Health-related quality of life, satisfaction, and economic outcome measures in studies of prostate cancer screening and treatment, 1990-2000.', 'Health Care Costs Attributable to Prostate Cancer in British Columbia, Canada: A Population-Based Cohort Study.', 'Multi-gene Pharmacogenomic Testing That Includes Decision-Support Tools to Guide Medication Selection for Major Depression: A Health Technology Assessment.', 'Cost-Utility Analysis of Radiation Treatment Modalities for Intermediate-Risk Prostate Cancer.', 'Economic evaluation of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy compared to open radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer treatment in Ontario, Canada.', 'Abiraterone vs. docetaxel for metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer: A microsimulation model.']"""

Until now, the stromal androgen receptor (AR) functions in the BPH development, and the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here we used a genetic knockout approach to ablate stromal fibromuscular (fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells) AR in a probasin promoter-driven prolactin transgenic mouse model (Pb-PRL tg mice) that could spontaneously develop prostate hyperplasia to partially mimic human BPH development. We found Pb-PRL tg mice lacking stromal fibromuscular AR developed smaller prostates, with more marked changes in the dorsolateral prostate lobes with less proliferation index. Mechanistically, prolactin mediated hyperplastic prostate growth involved epithelial-stromal interaction through epithelial prolactin/prolactin receptor signals to regulate granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor expression to facilitate stromal cell growth via sustaining signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 activity. Importantly, the stromal fibromuscular AR could modulate such epithelial-stromal interacting signals.

Despite substantial research on factors affecting treatment decisions, recurrence, and mortality, little is known about whether men receive guideline-concordant surveillance testing or whether receipt varies by year of diagnosis, time since treatment, or other individual characteristics.  Methods:   Surveillance testing following radical prostatectomy among elderly men was examined using Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results cancer registry data linked to Medicare claims. Multivariate logistic regression was used to examine the effect of demographic, tumor, and county-level characteristics on the odds of receiving surveillance testing within a given 1-year period following treatment.  Results:   Overall, receipt of surveillance testing was high, with 96% of men receiving at least one test the first year after treatment and approximately 80% receiving at least one test in the fifth year after treatment. Odds of not receiving a test declined with time since treatment. Nonmarried men, men with less-advanced disease, and non-Hispanic blacks and Hispanics had higher odds of not receiving a surveillance test. Year of diagnosis did not affect the receipt of surveillance tests.  Conclusions:   Most men receive guideline-concordant surveillance PSA testing after prostatectomy, although evidence of a racial disparity between non-Hispanic whites and some minority groups exists. The decline in surveillance over time suggests the need for well-designed long-term surveillance plans following radical prostatectomy.

However, flushes in men with prostate cancer, which commonly occur following androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), remain under-researched. This study is a qualitative exploration of flush-related cognitive appraisals and behavioural reactions reported by a sample of these men.  Methods:   Semi-structured, in-depth interviews were conducted with 19 men who were experiencing flushes after receiving ADT for prostate cancer. Framework analysis was used to generate and categorise emergent themes and explore associations between themes.  Results:   Five main cognitive appraisals included the following: changes in oneself, impact on masculinity, embarrassment/social-evaluative concerns, perceived control and acceptance/adjustment. There were men who held beliefs about the impact of flushes on their perceptions of traditional gender roles, who experienced shame and embarrassment due to concerns about the salience of flushes and perceptions by others and who experienced feelings of powerlessness over flushes. Powerlessness was associated with beliefs about the potentially fatal consequences of discontinuing treatment. Two other dominant themes included awareness/knowledge about flushes and management strategies. Experiences of flushes appeared to be influenced by upbringing and general experiences of prostate cancer and ADT.  Conclusions:   The range of men's appraisals of, and reactions to, flushes generated from this qualitative exploration were broadly similar to those of menopausal women but differed in terms of the influence of masculinity beliefs.

The AR mediates cellular responses in association with chromatin complexes and kinase cascades. Here we report that the nuclear matrix protein, scaffold attachment factor B1 (SAFB1), regulates AR activity and AR levels in a manner that suggests its involvement in PCa. SAFB1 mRNA expression was lower in PCa in comparison with normal prostate tissue in a majority of publicly available RNA expression data sets. SAFB1 protein levels were also reduced with disease progression in a cohort of human PCa that included metastatic tumors. SAFB1 bound to AR and was phosphorylated by the MST1 (Hippo homolog) serine-threonine kinase, previously shown to be an AR repressor, and MST1 localization to AR-dependent promoters was inhibited by SAFB1 depletion. Knockdown of SAFB1 in androgen-dependent LNCaP PCa cells increased AR and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, stimulated growth of cultured cells and subcutaneous xenografts and promoted a more aggressive phenotype, consistent with a repressive AR regulatory function. SAFB1 formed a complex with the histone methyltransferase EZH2 at AR-interacting chromatin sites in association with other polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) proteins.

Methods:   Human prostate cancer PC3 and LNCaP cells were tested. Cell viability was analyzed with MTT assay. Cell apoptosis, ROS level and mitochondrial transmembrane potential (mtΔψ) were measured with flow cytometry. Autophagy- and apoptosis-related proteins were studied using Western blotting. GFP-LC3B puncta, mitochondrial swelling and mitophagy were examined morphologically. Quantitative RT-PCR was used to measure LC3B mRNA level, and siRNA was used to knock down LC3BII.  Results:   In both PC3 and LNCaP cells, RAB (15 μmol/L) increased ROS accumulation and decreased mtΔψ in a time-dependent manner. Furthermore, RAB induced mitochondrial swelling and mitophagy, significantly increased LC3B expression and conversion of LC3BI to LC3BII, and the elimination of mitochondria by LC3BII-containing autophagolysosomes. In addition, RAB suppressed the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway activation. Pretreatment of PC3 cells with autophagy inhibitor 3-MA (5 mmol/L) or the lysosomal protease inhibitor CQ (10 μmol/L) significantly increased RAB-induced apoptosis. Similar results were obtained in RAB-treated PC3 cells with LC3B knocked down.  Conclusion:   RAB induces mitochondrial damage and mitophagy that attenuates RAB-induced prostate cancer cell death.

Methods:   A panel of human rhabdomyosarcoma Rh30 cells stably expressing myristoylation (Myr)-tagged one of class I PI3K p110 subunits was established. PI3K activity was analyzed by measuring phosphorylated Akt with Western blotting, and isoform-specific PI3K activities were validated with PI3K isoform-selective inhibitors. The growth of prostate cancer PC-3 cells and B cell type leukemia Raji cells was determined using SRB assay and CCK-8 assay, respectively.  Results:   The phosphorylation of Akt in Rh30-Myr-p110α, β, γ, δ cells was preferentially inhibited by PI3K isoform-selective inhibitors A66 (PI3Kα), TGX221 (PI3Kβ), AS604850 (PI3Kγ) and CAL-101 (PI3Kδ), respectively. A newly obtained PI3K inhibitor WJD008 (10 μmol/L) completely abrogated Akt phosphorylation by all the isoforms of class I PI3Ks, thus acted as a pan-PI3K inhibitor. In prostate cancer PC-3 cells, the PI3K isoform-selective inhibitors were much less potent than WJD008 in suppression of the proliferation. In B cell type leukemia Raji cells, inhibition of PI3Kδ alone or all the isoforms of class I PI3Ks displayed similar potency against the cell proliferation, whereas selective inhibition of individual PI3Kα/β/γ isoforms resulted in negligible activity.  Conclusion:   Rh30-Myr-p110α, β, γ, δ cells are a useful cell model to identify the selectivity of PI3K inhibitors.

Purpose:   To investigate the utility of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), quantitative DCE-MRI, and the two techniques combined at 3.0 T in detecting prostate cancer of the peripheral zone (PZ).  Material and methods:   DTI and DCE-MRI of 33 patients was acquired prior to prostate biopsy. Regions of interest (ROIs) were drawn according to biopsy zones which were apex, mid-gland, and base on each side of the PZ. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), fractional anisotropy (FA), volume transfer constant (K(trans)), and rate constant (kep) values of cancerous sextants and non-cancerous sextants in PZ were calculated. Logistic regression models were generated for DTI, DCE-MRI, and DTI + DCE-MRI. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to compare the ability of these models to differentiate cancerous sextants from non-cancerous sextants of PZ.  Results:   There were significant differences in the ADC, FA, K(trans), and kep values between cancerous sextants and non-cancerous sextants in PZ (P < 0.0001, P < 0.0001, P < 0.0001, and P < 0.0001, respectively).

A substantial proportion of men in this PSA span have prostate cancer (PCa), but biomarkers to determine who should undergo a prostate biopsy are lacking.  Objective:   To evaluate whether a genetic risk score identifies men in the PSA range of 1-3 ng/ml who are at higher risk for PCa.  Design, setting, and participants:   Men aged 50-69 yr with PSA 1-3 ng/ml and without a previous prostate biopsy were selected from the STHLM2 cohort. Of 2696 men, 49 SNPs were genotyped, and a polygenic risk score was calculated. Of these men, 860 were invited according to risk score, and 172 underwent biopsy.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The risk of PCa was assessed using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis.  Results and limitations:   PCa was diagnosed in 47 of 172 participants (27%), with Gleason sum 6 in 36 of 47 men (77%) and Gleason sum ≥7 in 10 of 47 men (21%); one man had intraductal cancer. The genetic score was a significant predictor of a positive biopsy (p=0.028), even after adjusting for PSA, ratio of free to total PSA, prostate volume, age, and family history. There was an increase in the odds ratio of 1.60 (95% confidence interval, 1.05-2.45) with increasing genetic risk score. The absolute risk difference of positive biopsy was 19 percentage points, comparing the high and low genetic risk group (37% vs 18%).  Conclusions:   A risk score based on SNPs predicts biopsy outcome in previously unbiopsied men with PSA 1-3 ng/ml. Introducing a genetic-based risk stratification tool can increase the proportion of men being classified in line with their true risk of PCa.""","""['Tobias Nordström', 'Markus Aly', 'Martin Eklund', 'Lars Egevad', 'Henrik Grönberg']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Transrectal saturation technique may improve cancer detection as an initial prostate biopsy strategy in men with prostate-specific antigen <10 ng/ml.', 'Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) isoform p2PSA significantly improves the prediction of prostate cancer at initial extended prostate biopsies in patients with total PSA between 2.0 and 10 ng/ml: results of a prospective study in a clinical setting.', 'Predictors of unfavourable repeat biopsy results in men participating in a prospective active surveillance program.', 'A multiparametric approach to improve upon existing prostate cancer screening and biopsy recommendations.', 'Recent advances in prostate cancer pathology: Gleason grading and beyond.', 'Dose outside of the prostate is associated with improved outcomes for high-risk prostate cancer patients treated with brachytherapy boost.', 'Complexities of Prostate Cancer.', 'External Validation of the Prostate Biopsy Collaborative Group Risk Calculator and the Rotterdam Prostate Cancer Risk Calculator in a Swedish Population-based Screening Cohort.', 'Germline Genetics of Prostate Cancer: Prevalence of Risk Variants and Clinical Implications for Disease Management.', 'Comprehensive Analysis of Multiple Cohort Datasets Deciphers the Utility of Germline Single-Nucleotide Polymorphisms in Prostate Cancer Diagnosis.']"""

We used the BBN-based radiopharmaceutical (99m)Technetium-HYNIC(tricine/TPPTS)-Aca-Bombesin(7-14) ((99m)Tc-HABBN) to perform a first-in-man clinical pilot study to evaluate the feasibility of (99m)Tc-HABBN SPECT/CT for detection of prostate cancer in patients.  Methods:   Eight patients with biopsy-proven prostate cancer who were scheduled for either radical prostatectomy or external beam radiotherapy underwent (99m)Tc-HABBN scintigraphy and SPECT/CT prior to treatment. Serial blood samples were taken to assess blood radioactivity and to determine in vivo metabolic stability. Clinical parameters were measured and reported side effects, if present, were recorded. Prostate cancer specimens of all patients were immunohistochemically stained for GRPR.  Results:   (99m)Tc-HABBN was synthesized with high radiochemical yield, purity and specific activity. There were no significant changes in clinical parameters, and there were no adverse or subjective side effects. Low metabolic stability was observed, as less than 20% of (99m)Tc-HABBN was intact after 30 min. Immunohistochemical staining for GRPR was observed in the prostate cancer specimens in all patients. (99m)Tc-HABBN scintigraphy and SPECT/CT did not detect prostate cancer in patients with proven disease.  Conclusions:   (99m)Tc-HABBN SPECT/CT for visualization of prostate cancer is safe but hampered by an unexpected low in vivo metabolic stability in man. The difference between the excellent in vitro stability of (99m)Tc-HABBN in human serum samples determined in our previous study regarding (99m)Tc-HABBN and the low in vivo metabolic stability determined in this study, is striking.

Most prostate tumors arise in the peripheral zone (70-75%) and in the transition zone (20-25%) while only 10% arise in the central zone. The aim of this study was to investigate if differences in miRNA expression could be a possible explanation for the difference in propensity of tumors in the zones of the prostate.  Methods:   Patients with prostate cancer were included in the study if they had a tumor with Gleason grade 3 in the PZ, the TZ, or both (n=16). Normal prostate tissue was collected from men undergoing cystoprostatectomy (n=20). The expression of 667 unique miRNAs was investigated using TaqMan low density arrays for miRNAs. Student's t-test was used in order to identify differentially expressed miRNAs, followed by hierarchical clustering and principal component analysis (PCA) to study the separation of the tissues. The ADtree algorithm was used to identify markers for classification of tissues and a cross-validation procedure was used to test the generality of the identified miRNA-based classifiers.  Results:   The t-tests revealed that the major differences in miRNA expression are found between normal and malignant tissues. Hierarchical clustering and PCA based on differentially expressed miRNAs between normal and malignant tissues showed perfect separation between samples, while the corresponding analyses based on differentially expressed miRNAs between the two zones showed several misplaced samples. A classification and cross-validation procedure confirmed these results and several potential miRNA markers were identified.  Conclusions:   The results of this study indicate that the major differences in the transcription program are those arising during tumor development, rather than during normal tissue development. In addition, tumors arising in the TZ have more unique differentially expressed miRNAs compared to the PZ. The results also indicate that separate miRNA expression signatures for diagnosis might be needed for tumors arising in the different zones.

On multivariable analysis, PSM was an independent prognostic factor for BCR (adjusted hazard ratio: 2.14 for PSMs vs negative surgical margins (NSMs); 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.86-2.45; P < 0.001). Other independent predictors for BCR were preoperative PSA, date of surgery, pT stage, Gleason score and lymph node involvement (all P < 0.001). The 5-year BCR-free probability was 80.6% (95% CI: 79-82.2) for NSMs vs 51% (95% CI: 47-55) for PSMs (log-rank P < 0.001). Patients with pT2 and pT3a PSMs had a similar prognosis to those with pT3a and pT3b NSMs, respectively (log-rank P ≥ 0.05).  Conclusion:   A PSM after MIRP is associated with 2.14-fold increased risk of BCR. In patients with pT2 and pT3a disease, a PSM could be considered a pathological upstaging.""","""['Adil Ouzzane', 'François Rozet', 'Rafael Sanchez Salas', 'Marc Galiano', 'Eric Barret', 'Dominique Prapotnich', 'Xavier Cathelineau']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Impact of positive surgical margins on prostate-specific antigen failure after radical prostatectomy in adjuvant treatment-naïve patients.', 'Prognostic significance of positive surgical margins after radical prostatectomy among pT2 and pT3a prostate cancer.', 'Short (≤ 1 mm) positive surgical margin and risk of biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy.', 'Long-term oncological outcomes after laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.', 'Radical prostatectomy for clinically localised prostate cancer at Rigshospitalet 1995-2011 - an analysis of surgical and oncological outcome.', 'Radical or Not-So-Radical Prostatectomy: Do Surgical Margins Matter?', 'Predictive Factors for Positive Surgical Margins in Patients With Prostate Cancer After Radical Prostatectomy: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'Wrong to be Right: Margin Laterality is an Independent Predictor of Biochemical Failure After Radical Prostatectomy.']"""

Our aim was to stratify EPE into prognostic groups.  Methods and results:   We reviewed 1051 radical prostatectomy (RP) specimens from 1998 to 2005. EPE was classified according to the extent, laterality and presence of perineural invasion (PNI) at the site of EPE. Cox regression was used to explore associations with biochemical recurrence. EPE was observed in 470 cases (44.7%), and predicted a higher progression rate than for organ-confined cancer [hazard ratio (HR) 1.4, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1-1.8, P = 0.007]. Focal versus established EPE according to Epstein (HR 2.0, 95% CI 1.1-3.5, P = 0.027) and Wheeler (HR 2.2, 95% CI 1.2-3.9, P = 0.010), and the radial distance of EPE dichotomized by the median (1.1 mm) (HR 1.5, 95% CI 1.1-2.2, P = 0.015), were all predictive of recurrence; but PNI at the site of EPE, circumferential length of EPE, number of sections and foci with EPE, and bilateral versus unilateral EPE were not.  Conclusions:   The radial extent of EPE predicts recurrence after RP, but circumferential extent, PNI at the site of EPE, number of sections or foci of EPE, and laterality do not. If validated, the proposed radial extent method may allow for more reproducible quantitation of EPE.""","""['Daniela Danneman', 'Fredrik Wiklund', 'Nils Peter Wiklund', 'Lars Egevad']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Histopathology""","""['Quantification of extraprostatic extension in prostate cancer: different parameters correlated to biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy.', 'Radial distance of extraprostatic extension measured by ocular micrometer is an independent predictor of prostate-specific antigen recurrence: A new proposal for the substaging of pT3a prostate cancer.', 'Evidence of perineural invasion on prostate biopsy specimen and survival after radical prostatectomy.', 'Prognostic significance of tumor volume in radical prostatectomy and needle biopsy specimens.', 'Perineural invasion as a predictor of extraprostatic extension of prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Negative mpMRI Rules Out Extra-Prostatic Extension in Prostate Cancer before Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Revisiting extraprostatic extension based on invasion depth and number for new algorithm for substaging of pT3a prostate cancer.', 'The relationship between amount of extra-prostatic extension and length of capsular contact: performances from MR images and radical prostatectomy specimens.', 'Assessing Extraprostatic Extension with Multiparametric MRI of the Prostate: Mehralivand Extraprostatic Extension Grade or Extraprostatic Extension Likert Scale?', 'The role of T2-weighted images in assessing the grade of extraprostatic extension of the prostate carcinoma.']"""

Material and methods:   Between 2006 and 2010, 441 patients with biopsy GS 7 underwent RP at Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark. Favourable histopathological features were defined as pT2 margin-negative cancer, RP specimen GS ≤ 3+4 and no lymph-node metastasis. Adverse histopathological features were defined as advanced pT3/4 cancer or pT2 margin-positive cancer and/or RP specimen GS ≥ 4+3 and/or positive lymph nodes. Biochemical failure was defined as the first prostate-specific antigen (PSA) ≥ 0.2 ng/ml.  Results:   A total of 344 patients (78.0%) had GS 3+4 in biopsies, while 97 patients (22.0%) had GS 4+3. No difference in age, PSA, percentage of biopsies with cancer, clinical tumour stage or volume on transrectal ultrasonography was found. Primary Gleason pattern 4 was associated with worse pathological stage (p = 0.049). On multivariate analysis, primary Gleason pattern 4 (p < 0.0001), cT stage (p = 0.024), PSA (p < 0.0001) and age (p = 0.009) predicted adverse histopathological features. In univariate analysis, Gleason score 3+4 had a significantly lower biochemical failure rate compared with Gleason score 4+3 (p = 0.0035). PSA (p < 0.0001), primary Gleason pattern 4 (p = 0.001) and percentage of biopsies with cancer (p = 0.02) were independently associated with risk of biochemical failure.  Conclusions:   In biopsies with GS 7, a primary Gleason pattern 4 was associated with significantly elevated risk of adverse histopathological features and biochemical failure compared to pattern 3 in patients undergoing RP.

Because aberrant DNA methylation associated with inappropriate gene-silencing is a common feature of PCa, DNA methylation inhibitors might constitute an alternative therapy. In this study we aimed to evaluate the anti-cancer properties of RG108, a novel non-nucleoside inhibitor of DNA methyltransferases (DNMT), in PCa cell lines.  Methods:   The anti-tumoral impact of RG108 in LNCaP, 22Rv1, DU145 and PC-3 cell lines was assessed through standard cell viability, apoptosis and cell cycle assays. Likewise, DNMT activity, DNMT1 expression and global levels of DNA methylation were evaluated in the same cell lines. The effectiveness of DNA demethylation was further assessed through the determination of promoter methylation and transcript levels of GSTP1, APC and RAR-β2, by quantitative methylation-specific PCR and RT-PCR, respectively.  Results:   RG108 led to a significant dose and time dependent growth inhibition and apoptosis induction in LNCaP, 22Rv1 and DU145. LNCaP and 22Rv1 also displayed decreased DNMT activity, DNMT1 expression and global DNA methylation. Interestingly, chronic treatment with RG108 significantly decreased GSTP1, APC and RAR-β2 promoter hypermethylation levels, although mRNA reexpression was only attained for GSTP1 and APC.  Conclusions:   RG108 is an effective tumor growth suppressor in most PCa cell lines tested. This effect is likely mediated by reversion of aberrant DNA methylation affecting cancer related-genes epigenetically silenced in PCa. However, additional mechanism might underlie the anti-tumor effects of RG108. In vivo studies are now mandatory to confirm these promising results and evaluate the potential of this compound for PCa therapy.""","""['Inês Graça', 'Elsa J Sousa', 'Tiago Baptista', 'Mafalda Almeida', 'João Ramalho-Carvalho', 'Carlos Palmeira', 'Rui Henrique', 'Carmen Jerónimo']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Curr Pharm Des""","""['RG108 induces the apoptosis of endometrial cancer Ishikawa cell lines by inhibiting the expression of DNMT3B and demethylation of HMLH1.', 'Pharmacological inhibition of DNA methylation attenuates pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy in rats.', 'RG108 increases NANOG and OCT4 in bone marrow-derived mesenchymal cells through global changes in DNA modifications and epigenetic activation.', 'DNA methyltransferase-1 inhibitors as epigenetic therapy for cancer.', 'DNA methylation as a target of epigenetic therapeutics in cancer.', 'Deciphering the potential ability of RG108 in cisplatin-induced HEI-OC1 ototoxicity: a research based on RNA-seq and molecular biology experiment.', 'DNA Methylation: Genomewide Distribution, Regulatory Mechanism and Therapy Target.', 'S100A8 and S100A12 Proteins as Biomarkers of High Disease Activity in Patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis That Can Be Regulated by Epigenetic Drugs.', 'Inhibitors of DNA Methylation.', 'An Epigenetic Role of Mitochondria in Cancer.']"""

In this report, the results demonstrated that the tanshinone II A, a key component of Salvia miltiorrhiza bunge, when it is combined with the cytotoxic drug cisplatin showed synergistic antitumor effects on human prostate cancer PC3 cells and LNCaP cells in vitro. Antiproliferative effects were detected with MTT assay. Cell cycle distribution and apoptosis were detected by flow cytometer. Protein expression was detected by Western blotting. The intracellular concentration of cisplatin was detected by high performance liquid chromatography. The results demonstrated that tanshinone II A significantly enhanced the antiproliferative effects of cisplatin on human prostate cancer PC3 cells and LNCaP cells with the increase of the intracellular concentration of cisplatin. These effects were correlated with cell cycle arrested at S phase and cell apoptosis. The apoptosis might be achieved through death receptor pathway and mitochondrial pathway. Furthermore, the Bcl-2 family members were also involved in this apoptotic process.
