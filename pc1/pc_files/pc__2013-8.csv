The relative contribution of local and circulating fibronectin to blood vessel formation in vivo remains unknown despite evidence for unexpected roles of circulating fibronectin in various diseases. Using transgenic mouse models, we established that circulating fibronectin facilitates the growth of bone metastases by enhancing blood vessel formation and maturation. This effect is more relevant than that of fibronectin produced by endothelial cells and pericytes, which only exert a small additive effect on vessel maturation. Circulating fibronectin enhances its local production in tumors through a positive feedback loop and increases the amount of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) retained in the matrix. Both fibronectin and VEGF then cooperate to stimulate blood vessel formation. Fibronectin content in the tumor correlates with the number of blood vessels and tumor growth in the mouse models. Consistent with these results, examination of three separate arrays from patients with breast and prostate cancers revealed that a high staining intensity for fibronectin in tumors is associated with increased mortality. These results establish that circulating fibronectin modulates blood vessel formation and tumor growth by modifying the amount of and the response to VEGF. Furthermore, determination of the fibronectin content can serve as a prognostic biomarker for breast and prostate cancers and possibly other cancers.""","""['Anja von Au', 'Matthaeus Vasel', 'Sabrina Kraft', 'Carla Sens', 'Norman Hackl', 'Alexander Marx', 'Philipp Stroebel', 'Jörg Hennenlotter', 'Tilman Todenhöfer', 'Arnulf Stenzl', 'Sarah Schott', 'Hans-Peter Sinn', 'Antoinette Wetterwald', 'Justo Lorenzo Bermejo', 'Marco G Cecchini', 'Inaam A Nakchbandi']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Neoplasia""","""['Suppression of heat shock protein 27 induces long-term dormancy in human breast cancer.', 'Cyclin A1 modulates the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor and promotes hormone-dependent growth and angiogenesis of breast cancer.', 'CD93 promotes β1 integrin activation and fibronectin fibrillogenesis during tumor angiogenesis.', 'Pristimerin Inhibits Prostate Cancer Bone Metastasis by Targeting PC-3 Stem Cell Characteristics and VEGF-Induced Vasculogenesis of BM-EPCs.', 'Hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha and vascular endothelial growth factor expression in circulating tumor cells of breast cancer patients.', 'FNDC1 is highly expressed in lung adenocarcinoma and closely related with poor prognosis.', 'Multimodal imaging demonstrates enhanced tumor exposure of PEGylated FUD peptide in breast cancer.', 'A Label-Free Segmentation Approach for Intravital Imaging of Mammary Tumor Microenvironment.', 'The Functional Role of Extracellular Matrix Proteins in Cancer.', 'Fibronectin and Its Receptors in Hematopoiesis.']"""

Materials and methods:   The study included 10 patients with biopsy-proven prostate cancer who underwent 3 Tesla prostate MRI. Diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) data were acquired at b = 0, 750, and 1500 s/mm(2) . For each b-value, data were acquired at TEs of 47, 75, and 100 ms. ADC and T2 were measured as a function of b-value and TE, respectively, in 15 cancer and 10 normal regions of interest (ROIs). The Friedman test was used to test the significance of changes in ADC as a function of TE and of T2 as a function of b-value.  Results:   In normal prostate ROIs, the ADC at TE of 47 ms is significantly smaller than ADC at TE of 100 ms (P = 0.0003) and T2 at b-value of 0 s/mm(2) is significantly longer than T2 at b-value of 1500 s/mm(2) (P = 0.001). In cancer ROIs, average ADC and T2 values do not change as a function of TE and b-value, respectively. However, in many cancer pixels, there are large decreases in the ADC as a function of TE and large increases in T2 as a function of b-value. Cancers are more conspicuous in ADC maps at longer TEs.  Conclusion:   Parameters derived from hybrid imaging that depend on coupled/associated values of ADC and T2 may improve the accuracy of MRI in diagnosing prostate cancer.""","""['Shiyang Wang', 'Yahui Peng', 'Milica Medved', 'Ambereen N Yousuf', 'Marko K Ivancevic', 'Ibrahim Karademir', 'Yulei Jiang', 'Tatjana Antic', 'Steffen Sammet', 'Aytekin Oto', 'Gregory S Karczmar']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Magn Reson Imaging""","""['Pilot Study of the Use of Hybrid Multidimensional T2-Weighted Imaging-DWI for the Diagnosis of Prostate Cancer and Evaluation of Gleason Score.', 'High and ultra-high b-value diffusion-weighted imaging in prostate cancer: a quantitative analysis.', 'Apparent diffusion coefficient for prostate cancer imaging: impact of B values.', 'Relationship between T2 relaxation and apparent diffusion coefficient in malignant and non-malignant prostate regions and the effect of peripheral zone fractional volume.', 'Molecular multimodal hybrid imaging in prostate and bladder cancer.', 'Detection of prostate cancer using diffusion-relaxation correlation spectrum imaging with support vector machine model - a feasibility study.', 'Comparing Radiologist Performance in Diagnosing Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer with Multiparametric versus Hybrid Multidimensional MRI.', 'Emerging MR methods for improved diagnosis of prostate cancer by multiparametric MRI.', 'Physically implausible signals as a quantitative quality assessment metric in prostate diffusion-weighted MR imaging.', 'Improved diffusion parameter estimation by incorporating T2 relaxation properties into the DKI-FWE model.']"""

In the endometrium, excess estrogen relative to progesterone produces a net proliferative stimulus, which may result in endometrial thickening. Therefore, the hypothesis that endometrial thickness is a biological marker of excess estrogen stimulation that is associated with risk of breast and endometrial carcinomas was tested. Endometrial thickness was measured in 1,272 postmenopausal women, aged 55-74 years, who underwent transvaginal ultrasound (TVU) screening as part of the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial. Serial endometrial thickness measurements were available for a subset of women at 1 year (n = 1,018), 2 years (n = 869) and 3 years (n = 641) after baseline. The associations between endometrial thickness and breast (n = 91) and endometrial (n = 14) carcinoma were evaluated by estimating relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using Cox proportional hazards regression with age as the time metric. Models incorporating baseline endometrial thickness and as a time-varying covariate using all measurements were examined. Median follow-up among study participants was 12.5 years (range: 0.3-13.8 years). Compared to baseline endometrial thickness of 1.0-2.99 mm, women with baseline endometrial thickness greater than or equal to 5.0 mm had an increased risk of breast (RR = 2.00, 95% CI = 1.15-3.48) and endometrial (RR = 5.02, 95% CI = 0.96-26.36) carcinomas in models adjusted for menopausal hormone use and BMI.

Emerging data indicate that Wip1 is amplified or overexpressed in various human tumors, and its detection implies a poor prognosis. In this study, we show that Wip1 interacts with and dephosphorylates BAX to suppress BAX-mediated apoptosis in response to γ-irradiation in prostate cancer cells. Radiation-resistant LNCaP cells showed dramatic increases in Wip1 levels and impaired BAX movement to the mitochondria after γ-irradiation, and these effects were reverted by a Wip1 inhibitor. These results show that Wip1 directly interacts with and dephosphorylates BAX. Dephosphorylation occurs at threonines 172, 174 and 186, and BAX proteins with mutations at these sites fail to translocate efficiently to the mitochondria following cellular γ-irradiation. Overexpression of Wip1 and BAX, but not phosphatase-dead Wip1, in BAX-deficient cells strongly reduces apoptosis. Our results suggest that BAX dephosphorylation of Wip1 phosphatase is an important regulator of resistance to anticancer therapy.

Method:   This study examined the associations of treatment regret, general QOL (36-item Short Form Health Survey physical and mental health (MCS) composite scores), and prostate-specific QOL (Prostate Cancer QOL sexual, urinary, bowl functioning, and cancer worry subscales) in 95 men who underwent RP for prostate cancer.  Results:   Multiple regression analyses indicated that poorer sexual and urinary functioning was associated with poorer MCS. Additionally, men with lower sexual and urinary functioning reported greater treatment regret. Treatment regret was also associated with lower MCS.

The objectives of this study were to quantitatively analyze the noise and the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) in cDWI as a function of b value by numerical simulations and by measurements in patients with prostate cancer and to compare cDWI to directly measured DWI at a b value of 1400 s/mm2.  Materials and methods:   Numerical simulations were performed to assess image noise and CNR in both cDWI and regular DWI. Forty-two patients with prostate cancer (age, 51-73 years; prostate specific antigen level, 0.5-30 ng/mL; and biopsy Gleason score, 6-9) received 2 DWI examinations at 3.0 T (one with b values of 100, 500, and 1400 s/mm2 and another with b values of 0, 100, 400, and 800 s/mm2) to create cDWI images at arbitrary b values, both with and without incorporating a b value of 0 s/mm2 in their calculation. Regions of interest were drawn to compare the scan time adjusted CNR (CNR eff) between cDWI and directly measured DWI at b = 1400 s/mm2 on tumor-suspicious lesions and normal-appearing regions.  Results:   In the numerical simulations, noise depended strongly on the b value, the diffusion coefficient, and the signal intensity at a b value of 0 s/mm2 in cDWI but not in regular DWI. The CNR between simulated tumor and normal regions showed a continuous increase with increasing b value. Both these findings were also observed in tumor-suspicious and normal-appearing regions in in vivo data. In vivo prostate DWI at a b value of 1400 s/mm2 showed a similar CNR eff between the tumor-suspicious regions and the normal-appearing tissue in cDWI as in the directly measured DWI (P = 0.395).  Conclusions:   The CNR eff between tumor-suspicious and normal-appearing prostate tissue in DWI images at a b value of 1400 s/mm2 is comparable in cDWI and directly measured DWI. Computed DWI at even higher b values, calculated from measured images with b values between 0 and 800 s/mm2, yields higher CNR eff than measured DWI, which may be of clinical aid in the management of prostate cancer.""","""['Marnix C Maas', 'Jurgen J Fütterer', 'Tom W J Scheenen']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Invest Radiol""","""['Evaluation of Exponential ADC (eADC) and Computed DWI (cDWI) for the Detection of Prostate Cancer.', 'High-b-value diffusion-weighted imaging at 3 T to detect prostate cancer: comparisons between b values of 1,000 and 2,000 s/mm2.', 'Evaluation of Diffusion Kurtosis Imaging Versus Standard Diffusion Imaging for Detection and Grading of Peripheral Zone Prostate Cancer.', 'Computed Diffusion-Weighted Imaging in Prostate Cancer: Basics, Advantages, Cautions, and Future Prospects.', 'Introduction to the Technical Aspects of Computed Diffusion-weighted Imaging for Radiologists.', 'Enhanced Image Processing Using Complex Averaging in Diffusion-Weighted Imaging of the Prostate: The Impact on Image Quality and Lesion Detectability.', 'A feasibility study of reduced full-of-view synthetic high-b-value diffusion-weighted imaging in uterine tumors.', 'Bosniak classification of cystic renal masses, version 2019: Is it helpful to incorporate the diffusion weighted imaging characteristic of lesions into the guideline?', 'Computed diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging with high b-values in the diagnosis of gallbladder lesions.', 'Physically implausible signals as a quantitative quality assessment metric in prostate diffusion-weighted MR imaging.']"""

Methods and materials:   A total of 124 kilovoltage cone-beam computed tomography (kV-CBCT) images from 6 patients were studied. For each KV-CBCT, 4 plans were retrospectively created using an isocenter shifting method with 2 different alignment focuses (prostate, PLN), an MLC shifting method, and the ART method. The selected dosimetric endpoints were compared among these plans.  Results:   For the isoshift contour, isoshift bone, MLC shift, and ART plans, D99 of the prostate was ≥97% of the prescription dose in 97.6%, 73.4%, 98.4%, and 96.8% of 124 fractions, respectively. Accordingly, D99 of the PLN was ≥97% of the prescription dose in 98.4%, 98.4%, 98.4%, and 100% of 124 fractions, respectively. For the rectum, D5 exceeded 105% of the planned D5 (and D5 of ART plans) in 11% (4%), 10% (2%), and 13% (5%) of 124 fractions, respectively. For the bladder, D5 exceeded 105% of the planned D5 (and D5 of ART) plans in 0% (2%), 0% (2%), and 0% (1%) of 124 fractions, respectively.  Conclusion:   For concurrent treatment of the prostate and PLN, with a planning margin to the prostate of 8 mm/6 mm posterior and a planning margin of 5 mm to the PLN, aligning to the prostate soft tissue can achieve adequate dose coverage to the both target volumes; aligning to the pelvic bone would result in underdosing to the prostate in one-third of fractions.

Methyl-β-cyclodextrin cholesterol extraction of all primary human tumor frozen sections tested (ovarian, testicular, neuroblastoma, prostate, breast, colon, pheochromocytoma and ganglioneuroma), unmasked previously ""invisible"" membrane GSLs for immunodetection. In ovarian carcinoma, globotriaosyl ceramide (Gb3), the GSL receptor for the antineoplastic Escherichia coli-derived verotoxin, was increased throughout the tumor. In colon carcinoma, Gb3 detection was vastly increased within the neovasculature and perivascular stroma. In tumors considered Gb3 negative (neuroblastoma, Leydig testicular tumor and pheochromocytoma), neovascular Gb3 was unmasked. Tumor-associated GSL stage-specific embryonic antigen (SSEA)-1, SSEA-3, SSEA-4 and globoH were unmasked according to tumor: SSEA-1 in prostate/colon; SSEA-3 in prostate; SSEA-4 in pheochromocytoma/some colon tumors; globoH in prostate/some colon tumors. In colon, anti-SSEA-1 was tumor cell specific. Within the GSL-cholesterol complex, filipin-cholesterol binding was also reduced. These results may relate to the ill-defined benefit of statins on cancer prognosis, for example, prostate carcinoma. We found novel anti-tumor GSL antibodies circulating in 3/5 statin-treated, but not untreated, prostate cancer patients. Lowering tumor membrane cholesterol may permit immune recognition of otherwise unavailable tumor-associated GSL carbohydrate, for more effective immunosurveillance and active/passive immunotherapy.

IL-6/pSTAT3 appears critical as elevated IL-6 and pSTAT3 correlate with CRPC and poor prognosis. We previously reported on the Fer tyrosine kinase being an integral component of the IL-6 pathway in PC by controlling STAT3. Since IL-6 also controls androgen receptor (AR) signaling via pSTAT3, we tested if Fer participates in this cross-talk. We report for the first time that in addition to STAT3, Fer is required for IL-6 mediated AR activation by phosphorylating AR tyrosine 223 and binding via its SH2 domain. Fer controls IL-6 induced growth response and PSA expression, while modestly contributing to EGF and IGF-1 effects. Finally, Fer, AR and pSTAT3 co-localize in the PC cell nucleus, including in prostate tissues from CRPC patients.

Our previous studies showed that Sema3s are also involved in the lymph node metastasis of prostate cancer, and are likely to modulate the behavior of prostate cancer with a pro-tumoral or an anti-tumoral effect, depending on their subtypes. However, no study has critically investigated the value of Sema3s expression in preoperative biopsy samples for the prediction of biochemical recurrence (BCR) after radical prostatectomy. In this study, we evaluated Sema3s expression by immunohistochemistry on 198 prostate biopsies with low- and intermediate-risk localized prostate cancer. The median follow-up was 42 months (range, 6-60) for all patients. Our results showed that Sema3A (OR: 0.19, P<0.001), Sema3B (OR: 0.38, P=0.003), Sema3E (OR: 0.39, P=0.007), and Sema3C (OR: 2.31, P=0.014) staining were independent predictors of BCR on multivariable analysis.

Our findings suggested that Sema3A, 3B, 3C, and 3E immunostaining in prostate biopsies, as supplements to clinicopathological parameters, could be used for predicting BCR in low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancer patients after radical prostatectomy.

Finally, numerical simulations of a tumor growing in 2-dimensions with radial symmetry are carried in order to evaluate the therapeutic potential of different treatment strategies. These simulations are able to reproduce a variety of clinically observed responses to treatment, and suggest treatment strategies that may result in tumor remission, underscoring our model's potential to make a significant contribution in the field of prostate cancer therapeutics.""","""['Avner Friedman', 'Harsh Vardhan Jain']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Math Biosci Eng""","""['Systemic therapeutic strategies for prostate cancer.', 'A nonlinear model with competition between prostate tumor cells and its application to intermittent androgen suppression therapy of prostate cancer.', 'Immunomagnetic quantification of circulating tumor cells as a prognostic factor of androgen deprivation responsiveness in patients with hormone naive metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Mathematical modelling of prostate cancer growth and its application to hormone therapy.', 'The utility of prostate-specific antigen in the management of advanced prostate cancer.', 'A PDE Model of Breast Tumor Progression in MMTV-PyMT Mice.', 'Combination therapy for mCRPC with immune checkpoint inhibitors, ADT and vaccine: A mathematical model.']"""

Methods:   From January 2006 to December 2009, 3000 patients underwent a 21-core transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy at Henri Mondor Hospital (Créteil, France) and were prospectively followed. All patients had a fluoroquinolone antimicrobial prophylaxis for 7 days. The primary study end-point was to evaluate the incidence of iatrogenic acute prostatitis within 1 month after the biopsy. The secondary end-point was to analyze the clinical and the bacterial features of the prostatitis.  Results:   Overall, 20 patients of the entire study population (0.67%) had an acute bacterial prostatitis within 2.90 ± 1.77 days (range 1-7 days) after the transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy. The groups of patients with (n = 20) and without (n = 2980) infection were similar in terms of age, prostate-specific antigen level and prostate volume. Escherichia coli was the only isolated bacteria. The subsequent tests for antibiotic susceptibility showed a 95% resistance for fluroquinolone and amoxicillin. Resistance to amoxiclav, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, third generation cephalosporin and amikacin was 70%, 70%, 25% and 5% respectively. No resistance to imipenem was reported. They were all admitted for treatment without the need of intensive care unit referral. Complete recovery was achieved after 21.4 ± 7 days of antibiotic treatment.  Conclusions:   A fluroquinolone-based regimen still represents an appropriate prophylaxis protocol to minimize the risk of acute prostatitis secondary to prostate biopsy. Patients should be provided the appropriate care soon after the onset of the symptoms. An intravenous third generation cephalosporin or imipenem-based therapy seem to provide satisfying results.""","""['Alexandre Campeggi', 'Idir Ouzaid', 'Evanguelos Xylinas', 'Philippe Lesprit', 'Andras Hoznek', 'Dimitri Vordos', 'Claude-Clément Abbou', 'Laurent Salomon', 'Alexandre de la Taille']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Int J Urol""","""['Editorial comment to Acute bacterial prostatitis after transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy: epidemiological, bacterial and treatment patterns from a 4-year prospective study.', 'Prevalence of fluoroquinolone-resistant Escherichia coli before and incidence of acute bacterial prostatitis after prostate biopsy.', 'Incidence of acute prostatitis caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli after transrectal prostate biopsy.', 'Selective culture of Escherichia coli to prevent infective complications of transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy: Clinical efficacy and analysis of characteristics of quinolone-resistant Escherichia coli.', 'Levofloxacin resistant Escherichia coli sepsis following an ultrasound-guided transrectal prostate biopsy: report of four cases and review of the literature.', 'Infection after transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy.', 'Rectal Culture-Based Versus Empirical Antibiotic Prophylaxis to Prevent Infectious Complications in Men Undergoing Transrectal Prostate Biopsy: A Randomized, Nonblinded Multicenter Trial.', 'Acute prostatitis associated with noncancerous prostate at the Lubumbashi University Clinics: epidemioclinical and therapeutic features.', 'Acute prostatitis after prostate biopsy under ciprofloxacin prophylaxis with or without ornidazole and pre-biopsy enema: analysis of 3.479 prostate biopsy cases.', 'Bacterial Urinary Tract Infection after Transrectal Placement of Fiducial Markers prior to Proton Radiotherapy for Prostate Cancer.', 'Surgical and functional outcomes of radical retropubic prostatectomy after biopsy-related acute prostatitis.']"""

The main obstacles associated with the transfer of this activity to general practice include lack of experience and uncertainty as to whether general practitioners (GPs) can handle follow-up.  Material and methods:   A Steering Committee was established in collaboration with health-care professionals to devise a strategy for a shared care model. An action plan was designed that included 1) the development of a shared care model for follow-up and treatment, 2) implementation of the shared care model in cooperation between the parties involved, 3) design of procedures for re-referral, and 4) evaluation of effect, change processes and contextual factors.  Results:   A total of 2,585 patients with PC were included in the study: 1,172 had disseminated disease, 754 had no recurrence after curative treatment, 244 who had been treated with a curative intent were being treated for relapse, 186 underwent watchful waiting, 135 underwent active surveillance, while other scenarios applied in the remaining 94 cases. A total of 530 patients were transferred to follow-up with a GP and 2,055 were not transferred to their GP. The main reason why patients were considered not suitable for transfer to primary health care was the patients' own desire (33%), followed by clinical or biochemical disease progression (33%). The evaluation found that 96% of the patients were very comfortable with the permanent or temporary closure of the hospital course.

Case presentation:   We present the case of M.I., a 74-year-old male admitted in our surgical unit with diffuse left lumbar pain, low urinary tract symptoms and slow increase in abdomen volume in the past 4 years. Computer tomography scan and ecography showed a large left lumbar cyst like mass with a dilated supernumerary ureter with ectopic ureteral orifice in the prostatic urethra and apparently normal anatomic inferior renal unit. The goal was the excision of the ""cyst like"" mass (superior left renal unit) but because of the anatomical particularities (extensive fibrosis and local topographical changes) total nephrectomy was performed.  Conclusions:   Given a normal contralateral kidney, the discovery of a urinary abnormality can be a real challenge, their evolution being a silent one.

A total of 116 patients with PC, 120 patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and 120 healthy controls were enrolled in this study. PC patients were divided into bone metastasis (BM) group (n=56) and non-bone metastasis (NBM) group (n=60). Serum BSP was detected by Sandwich ELISA. Severity of bone pain was evaluated using visual analogue score (VAS). Serum f-PSA and t-PSA levels were measured by using electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA). PSADT was calculated according to the formula: PSADT=lg(2)/[log(PSA2)-log(PSA1)]. The mean serum BSP level in PC patients with BM was significantly higher than in PC patients without BM, BPH patients and controls (P<0.001 for all). Pearson's analysis showed that serum BSP level was positively correlated with VAS in PC patients with BM (P<0.05). Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis demonstrated that BSP discriminated patients with BM from those without BM at the cutoff value of 33.26 ng/mL. The sensitivity and specificity were 78.21% and 79.28%, respectively. The optimal cutoff value of PSADT was 131 days, with sensitivity of 85.69% and specificity of 85.36%. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that subjects with higher BSP levels/shorter PSADT had a shorter BM-free period than those with lower BSP levels/longer PSADT. Serum BSP and PSADT are useful biomarkers for the diagnosis of BM from PC, and can be regarded as independent factors for predicting the prognosis of BM from PC.

Methods:   Two focus groups were conducted, consisting of six ADT and eight non-ADT men, respectively.

However, not all themes were present in both the ADT and the non-ADT sub-groups.  Conclusions:   These results further highlight the link between physical activity and quality of life in prostate cancer survivors and how they use physical activity as a part of their survivorship process.

We found that sclerostin levels are significantly increased in PC patients, particularly in those with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), and there is an inverse relationship between sclerostin levels and testosterone.  Introduction:   Recent studies have evaluated sclerostin levels in bone diseases as osteoporosis. However, there are few data in PC patients, particularly in patients with hypogonadism related to ADT. The aim of the present study was to compare serum sclerostin levels in ADT/non-ADT-treated PC patients and healthy controls and to evaluate their relationship with sex steroids and bone metabolism.  Methods:   We performed a cross-sectional study involving 81 subjects: 25 ADT-treated PC patients, 34 PC patients without ADT treatment, and 22 healthy controls. We measured serum sclerostin levels, bone turnover markers, bone mineral density (BMD) in all individuals, and sex steroids levels in PC patients.  Results:   Serum sclerostin levels were significantly higher in PC patients compared to those in control subjects. ADT-treated patients had significantly higher sclerostin levels than PC patients without ADT treatment: ADT 64.52 ± 27.21 pmol/L, non-ADT 48.24 ± 15.93 pmol/L, healthy controls 38.48 ± 9.19 pmol/L, p < 0.05. In PC patients, we found a negative relationship between serum sclerostin levels and androgens after age adjustment (total testosterone: r = -0.309, p = 0.029; bioavailable testosterone: r = -0.280, p = 0.049; free testosterone: r = -0.299, p = 0.035). We did not observe any relationship between sclerostin levels and bone turnover markers or BMD in any group.  Conclusions:   Circulating sclerostin levels are significantly increased in patients with PC and particularly in those receiving ADT.

Loss of the tumor suppressor PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog) is frequently observed in cancer, resulting in the deregulation of cell survival, growth, and proliferation. We hypothesize that loss of PTEN and subsequent activation of Akt, frequent occurrences in prostate cancer, regulate the CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling axis in tumor growth and bone metastasis.  Methods:   Murine prostate epithelial cells from PTEN+/+, PTEN+/-, and PTEN-/- (prostate specific knockdown) mice as well as human prostate cancer cell lines C4-2B, PC3, and DU145 were used in gene expression and invasion studies with Akt inhibition. Additionally, HA-tagged Akt1 was overexpressed in DU145, and tumor growth in subcutaneous and intra-tibia bone metastasis models were analyzed.  Results:   Loss of PTEN resulted in increased expression of CXCR4 and CXCL12 and Akt inhibition reversed expression and cellular invasion. These results suggest that loss of PTEN may play a key role in the regulation of this chemokine activity in prostate cancer. Overexpression of Akt1 in DU145 resulted in increased CXCR4 expression, as well as increased proliferation and cell cycle progression. Subcutaneous injection of these cells also resulted in increased tumor growth as compared to neo controls. Akt1 overexpression reversed the osteosclerotic phenotype associated with DU145 cells to an osteolytic phenotype and enhanced intra-osseous tumor growth.  Conclusions:   These results suggest the basis for activation of CXCL12 signaling through CXCR4 in prostate cancer driven by the loss of PTEN and subsequent activation of Akt. Akt1-associated CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling promotes tumor growth, suggesting that Akt inhibitors may potentially be employed as anticancer agents to target expansion of PC bone metastases.""","""['M Katie Conley-LaComb', 'Allen Saliganan', 'Pridvi Kandagatla', 'Yong Q Chen', 'Michael L Cher', 'Sreenivasa R Chinni']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Mol Cancer""","""['CXCR4 and PTEN are involved in the anti-metastatic regulation of anethole in DU145 prostate cancer cells.', 'Tumor-derived CXCL8 signaling augments stroma-derived CCL2-promoted proliferation and CXCL12-mediated invasion of PTEN-deficient prostate cancer cells.', 'Loss of PTEN permits CXCR4-mediated tumorigenesis through ERK1/2 in prostate cancer cells.', 'The CXCR4/SDF-1 chemokine axis: a potential therapeutic target for bone metastases?', 'Demystifying the CXCR4 conundrum in cancer biology: Beyond the surface signaling paradigm.', 'MiR-30e-5p overexpression promotes proliferation and migration of colorectal cancer cells by activating the CXCL12 axis via downregulating PTEN.', 'Activation of the IL-17 signalling pathway by the CXCL17-GPR35 axis affects drug resistance and colorectal cancer tumorigenesis.', 'Obesity and prostate cancer - microenvironmental roles of adipose tissue.', 'Myricetin: a potential plant-derived anticancer bioactive compound-an updated overview.', 'Extracellular Vesicles and Their Zeta Potential as Future Markers Associated with Nutrition and Molecular Biomarkers in Breast Cancer.']"""

SMIP004 decreased the levels of positive cell cycle regulators, upregulated cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, and resulted in G1 arrest, inhibition of colony formation in soft agar, and cell death. However, the mechanism of SMIP004-induced cancer cell selective apoptosis remained unknown. Here, we used chemical genomic and proteomic profiling to unravel a SMIP004-induced pro-apoptotic pathway, which initiates with disruption of mitochondrial respiration leading to oxidative stress. This, in turn, activates two pathways, one eliciting cell cycle arrest by rapidly targeting cyclin D1 for proteasomal degradation and driving the transcriptional downregulation of the androgen receptor, and a second pathway that activates pro-apoptotic signaling through MAPK activation downstream of the unfolded protein response (UPR).

As a result, several targeting agents are being investigated. However, the efficacy of current regimens is generally insufficient for their toxicity and poor overall response rates. We have recently reported that naftopidil exerts growth-inhibitory effects on human prostate cancer cells. In this study, we investigated the biochemical mechanisms by which naftopidil produces growth-inhibitory and antiangiogenic effects on RCC. We first tested the effects of naftopidil on the proliferation of ACHN and Caki-2 RCC cells. Next, we set up a model simulating the tumor microenvironment, in which ACHN cells were grafted onto the renal capsule of mice. We then tested the effects of naftopidil on human umbilical vein endothelial cells' cell proliferation and Matrigel plug vascularization. Finally, to establish the antitumor activity of naftopidil on RCC, we tested the antitumor effects of naftopidil on excised tumor specimens from 20 patients with RCC that were grafted beneath the renal capsule of mice. Naftopidil showed similar in vitro growth-inhibitory effects on all cell lines. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis revealed an increase in G1 cell-cycle arrest in all naftopidil-treated cell lines. In vivo tumorigenic studies showed a significant reduction of ACHN tumor weight, Ki-67 index, and microvessel density (MVD) in naftopidil-treated mice. Naftopidil attenuated neovascularization in an in vivo Matrigel plug assay. Studies in mouse xenograft models also showed a significant MVD reduction in naftopidil-treated excised human RCC. The growth-inhibitory effects of naftopidil suggest it may be a novel anticancer agent and a potential preventive option for RCC.""","""['Yoichi Iwamoto', 'Kenichiro Ishii', 'Takeshi Sasaki', 'Manabu Kato', 'Hideki Kanda', 'Yasushi Yamada', 'Kiminobu Arima', 'Taizo Shiraishi', 'Yoshiki Sugimura']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Cancer Prev Res (Phila)""","""['Naftopidil, a selective {alpha}1-adrenoceptor antagonist, suppresses human prostate tumor growth by altering interactions between tumor cells and stroma.', 'BMP-2 inhibits tumor growth of human renal cell carcinoma and induces bone formation.', 'Naftopidil, a selective alpha-1 adrenoceptor antagonist, inhibits growth of human prostate cancer cells by G1 cell cycle arrest.', 'Renal cell carcinoma management: A step to nano-chemoprevention.', 'Phytochemicals for the Prevention and Treatment of Renal Cell Carcinoma: Preclinical and Clinical Evidence and Molecular Mechanisms.', 'Repurposed Drugs in Gastric Cancer.', 'Role of α- and β-adrenergic signaling in phenotypic targeting: significance in benign and malignant urologic disease.', 'Classification of Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma based on Tumor Suppressor Genomic Profiling.', 'Repurposing of α1-Adrenoceptor Antagonists: Impact in Renal Cancer.', 'Drug Repositioning of the α1-Adrenergic Receptor Antagonist Naftopidil: A Potential New Anti-Cancer Drug?']"""

After treating LNCaP-LN3 cells with pargyline or tranylcypromine, we examined cell proliferation, cell cycle pattern, apoptosis and the expression levels of apoptosis-related genes. The proliferation of cells exposed to pargyline decreased in a dose- and time-dependent manner, while tranylcypromine-treated cells showed the opposite results. Treatment with pargyline significantly induced cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase compared to the control and tranylcypromine-treated cells. In addition, pargyline induced an increase in the cell death rate by promoting apoptosis; however, tranylcypromine had no effect on LNCaP-LN3 cells.

Methods:   The charts of 138 prostate cancer patients without enlarged lymph nodes on CT, in whom a pre-treatment MRL was performed were reviewed. Endpoints were distant metastases-free survival and overall survival. Relation between the following factors and outcome were investigated: T-stage, PSA value at diagnosis, Gleason score, diameter (short axis and long axis) of the largest MRL-positive lymph node, number of MRL-positive lymph nodes, the presence of extra-pelvic nodal disease, and the extent of resection of the positive lymph nodes. Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed to estimate the survival functions.  Results:   Of the 138 patients, 24 (17%) had a positive MRL. Patients with a short axis of the largest positive lymph node of ≤8 mm had a significantly better 5-year distant metastases-free (79% vs 16%) and overall survival (81% vs 36%) than patients with larger positive lymph nodes.

Despite this, injection anxiety and pain related to injection are significant barriers to its use.  Aims:   This study aims to examine injection anxiety and injection pain in patients using ICI.  Methods:   Men starting ICI therapy post radical pelvic surgery completed questionnaires at initial visit, at each of the two ICI training sessions and at a 4-month follow-up visit.  Main outcome measures:   Injection Anxiety Scale, Injection Pain Scale, Injection Reaction Inventory, and the Erectile Function Domain of the International Index of Erectile Function.  Results:   Average age of the 68 men was 60±8 years. At 4 months, the self-reported frequency of ICI use was: 29%<1/week, 26% 1/week, 40% 2/week, and 5% 3/week. Mean injection anxiety score at first injection was 5.7±2.8 (range 0-10) and significantly decreased to a 4.1±3 at 4 months (P<0.001). At first injection, 65% reported high injection anxiety (≥5) and this significantly decreased to 42% (P=0.003) at 4 months. Anxiety at first injection was negatively related to ICI frequency at 4 months (r=-0.23, P=0.08). Mean injection pain score at first injection was low (2.2±1.8, range 0-10) and 59% rated injection pain≤2. Injection pain remained consistent across time periods. At first injection, injection anxiety (assessed prior to injection) was related to injection pain (r=0.21, P=0.04) and subjects (n=21) who reported high injection anxiety (≥5) across time points, reported an increase in injection pain scores from first injection to 4 months (2.7 vs. 3.7, P=0.05).  Conclusions:   Although injection anxiety decreased with ICI use, mean injection anxiety remained at a moderate level (4.4) and 42% of men continued to report ""high"" injection anxiety at 4 months. While injection pain was low, injection anxiety and pain were related.

Resveratrol-evoked Ca(2+) entry was not inhibited by nifedipine, econazole, SKF96365 and the protein kinase C inhibitor GF109203X, but was nearly abolished by the protein kinase C activator phorbol 12-myristate 13 acetate. In Ca(2+)-free medium, treatment with the endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) pump inhibitor 2,5-di-tert-butylhydroquinone decreased resveratrol-evoked rise in [Ca(2+)]i. Conversely, treatment with resveratrol inhibited BHQ-evoked rise in [Ca(2+)]i. Inhibition of phospholipase C with U73122 did not alter resveratrol-evoked rise in [Ca(2+)]i. Previous studies showed that resveratrol between 10 and 100 µM induced cell death in various cancer cell types including PC3 cells. However, in this study, resveratrol (1-10 μM) increased cell viability, which was abolished by chelating cytosolic Ca(2+) with 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetra-acetic acid-acetoxymethyl ester (BAPTA/AM). Therefore, it is suggested that in PC3 cells, resveratrol had a dual effect on viability: at low concentrations (1-10 µM) it induced proliferation, whereas at higher concentrations it caused cell death. Collectively, our data suggest that in PC3 cells, resveratrol-induced rise in [Ca(2+)]i by evoking phospholipase C-independent Ca(2+) release from the endoplasmic reticulum and Ca(2+) entry, via protein kinase C-regulated mechanisms. Resveratrol at 1-10 µM also caused Ca(2+)-dependent cell proliferation.""","""['Hong-Tai Chang', 'Chiang-Ting Chou', 'I-Li Chen', 'Wei-Zhe Liang', 'Daih-Huang Kuo', 'Jong-Khing Huang', 'Pochuen Shieh', 'Chung-Ren Jan']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Recept Signal Transduct Res""","""['Mechanisms of resveratrol-induced changes in cytosolic free calcium ion concentrations and cell viability in OC2 human oral cancer cells.', 'The mechanism of protriptyline-induced Ca2+ movement and non-Ca2+-triggered cell death in PC3 human prostate cancer cells.', 'Effect of caffeic acid on Ca(2+) homeostasis and apoptosis in SCM1 human gastric cancer cells.', 'Resveratrol and calcium signaling: molecular mechanisms and clinical relevance.', 'Resveratrol commonly displays hormesis: occurrence and biomedical significance.', 'Molecular Basis of Prostate Cancer and Natural Products as Potential Chemotherapeutic and Chemopreventive Agents.', 'Establishment of malignantly transformed dendritic cell line SU3-ihDCTC induced by Glioma stem cells and study on its sensitivity to resveratrol.', 'Resveratrol increases nitric oxide production in the rat thick ascending limb via Ca2+/calmodulin.', 'Prostate cancer prophylaxis by dietary supplements: more than just an illusion?.']"""

Here, we identify six novel candidate DNA methylation markers for PC with promising diagnostic and prognostic potential.  Methods:   Microarray-based screening and bisulfite sequencing of 20 nonmalignant and 29 PC tissue specimens were used to identify new candidate DNA hypermethylation markers for PC. Diagnostic and prognostic potential was evaluated in 35 nonmalignant prostate tissue samples, 293 radical prostatectomy (RP) samples (cohort 1, training), and 114 malignant RP samples (cohort 2, validation) collected in Denmark, Switzerland, Germany, and Finland. Sensitivity and specificity for PC were evaluated by receiver operating characteristic analyses. Correlations between DNA methylation levels and biochemical recurrence were assessed using log-rank tests and univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses.  Results:   Hypermethylation of AOX1, C1orf114, GAS6, HAPLN3, KLF8, and MOB3B was highly cancer specific (area under the curve, 0.89 to 0.98). Furthermore, high C1orf114 methylation was significantly (P < .05) associated with biochemical recurrence in multivariate analysis in cohort 1 (hazard ratio [HR], 3.10; 95% CI, 1.89 to 5.09) and was successfully validated in cohort 2 (HR, 3.27; 95% CI, 1.17 to 9.12).

Patients and methods:   We used a population-based retrospective cohort design. Data were obtained from several Ontario health care administrative databases. Within a cohort of men older than age 66 years with incident diabetes who subsequently developed PC, we examined the effect of duration of antidiabetic medication exposure after PC diagnosis on all-cause and PC-specific mortality. Crude and adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated by using a time-varying Cox proportional hazard model to estimate effects.  Results:   The cohort consisted of 3,837 patients. Median age at diagnosis of PC was 75 years (interquartile range [IQR], 72 to 79 years). During a median follow-up of 4.64 years (IQR, 2.7 to 7.1 years), 1,343 (35%) died, and 291 patients (7.6%) died as a result of PC. Cumulative duration of metformin treatment after PC diagnosis was associated with a significant decreased risk of PC-specific and all-cause mortality in a dose-dependent fashion. Adjusted HR for PC-specific mortality was 0.76 (95% CI, 0.64 to 0.89) for each additional 6 months of metformin use. The association with all-cause mortality was also significant but declined over time from an HR of 0.76 in the first 6 months to 0.93 between 24 and 30 months.

CXCR4 expression is transcriptionally regulated in cancer cells and is associated with aggressive prostate cancer phenotypes. Previously, we and others have shown that the transcription factor ERG regulates CXCR4 expression in prostate cancer cells and that androgens modulate CXCR4 expression via increasing ERG expression. Herein, the molecular mechanisms of ERG-mediated CXCR4 promoter activation, phosphorylation of ERG by intracellular kinases and subsequent CXCR4 expression, as well as the status of ERG and CXCR4 in human prostate cancer specimens were investigated. Using multiple molecular strategies, it was demonstrated that (i) ERG expressed in TMPRSS2-ERG fusion positive VCaP cells selectively binds to specific ERG/Ets bindings sites in the CXCR4 promoter; (ii) distal binding sites mediate promoter activation; (iii) exogenously expressed ERG promotes CXCR4 expression; (iv) ERG is phosphorylated at Serine-81 and -215, by both IKK and Akt kinases, and Akt mediates CXCR4 expression; (v) ERG-induced CXCR4 drives CXCL12-dependent adhesion to fibronectin; and (vi) ERG and CXCR4 were coexpressed in human prostate cancer tissue, consistent with ERG-mediated transcriptional activation of CXCR4. These data demonstrate that ERG activates CXCR4 expression by binding to specific ERG/Ets responsive elements and via intracellular kinases that phosphorylate ERG at discrete serine residues.

To test this hypothesis, we examined whether TMPRSS2-ERG status was associated with biochemical failure after clinical induction of DNA damage following image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT).  Methods:   Pretreatment biopsies from two cohorts of patients with intermediate-risk prostate cancer [T1/T2, Gleason score (GS) < 8, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) < 20 ng/mL; >7 years follow-up] were analyzed: (i) 126 patients [comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) cohort] with DNA samples assayed by array CGH (aCGH) for the TMPRSS2-ERG fusion; and (ii) 118 patients [immunohistochemical (IHC) cohort] whose biopsy samples were scored within a defined tissue microarray (TMA) immunostained for ERG overexpression (known surrogate for TMPRSS2-ERG fusion). Patients were treated with IGRT with a median dose of 76 Gy. The potential role of TMPRSS2-ERG status as a prognostic factor for biochemical relapse-free rate (bRFR; nadir + 2 ng/mL) was evaluated in the context of clinical prognostic factors in multivariate analyses using a Cox proportional hazards model.  Results:   TMPRSS2-ERG fusion by aCGH was identified in 27 (21%) of the cases in the CGH cohort, and ERG overexpression was found in 59 (50%) patients in the IHC cohort. In both cohorts, TMPRSS2-ERG status was not associated with bRFR on univariate or multivariate analysis.  Conclusions:   In two similarly treated IGRT cohorts, TMPRSS2-ERG status was not prognostic for bRFR, in disagreement with the hypothesis that these prostate cancers have DNA repair defects that render them clinically more radiosensitive.

Using an inducible Cre driver to simultaneously inactivate Pten while activating oncogenic Kras and a fluorescent reporter allele in the prostate epithelium, we performed lineage tracing in vivo to define the temporal and spatial occurrence of prostate tumors, disseminated tumor cells, and metastases. These analyses revealed that though disseminated tumors cells arise early following the initial occurrence of prostate tumors, there is a significant temporal lag in metastasis, which is temporally coincident with the up-regulation of Etv4 expression in primary tumors. Functional studies showed that knockdown of Etv4 in a metastatic cell line derived from the mouse model abrogates the metastatic phenotype but does not affect tumor growth. Notably, expression and activation of ETV4, but not other oncogenic ETS genes, is correlated with activation of both PI3-kinase and Ras signaling in human prostate tumors and metastases.

By using an ex vivo enrichment process against freshly disaggregated tumors to purge the repertoire, in combination with in vivo biopanning at optimized phage circulation time, we have identified a human domain antibody capable of mediating selective localization of phage to human prostate cancer xenografts. Affinity chromatography followed by mass spectrometry analysis showed that the antibody recognizes the proteasome activator complex PA28. The specificity of soluble antibody was confirmed by demonstrating its binding to the active human PA28αβ complex. Whereas systemically administered control phage was confined in the lumen of blood vessels of both normal tissues and tumors, the selected phage spread from tumor vessels into the perivascular tumor parenchyma. In these areas, the selected phage partially colocalized with PA28 complex. Furthermore, we found that the expression of the α subunit of PA28 [proteasome activator complex subunit 1 (PSME1)] is elevated in primary and metastatic human prostate cancer and used anti-PSME1 antibodies to show that PSME1 is an accessible marker in mouse xenograft tumors.

In our previous studies, we found that PSMA suppresses the metastasis of PCa, yet the underlying mechanism remains unknown. To identify the genes related to tumor metastasis possibly regulated by PSMA, we performed tumor metastasis PCR array assay to analyze the differentially expressed tumor metastasis-related genes. Eighty-four tumor metastasis related genes were screened in si-PSMA LNCap cells (PSMA silenced by siRNA)/LNCap cells and in PC-3/LNcap cells, respectively. Expression levels of possible related genes were verified by real-time PCR in 4 prostate cancer cell lines (LNCap, 22RV1, PC-3 and DU145) and in 85 clinical samples (12 normal, 26 benign prostatic hypertrophy and 47 prostate cancer tissues). The results showed that 10 genes (including CDH6 and CXCL12) were upregulated and 4 genes (CCL7, ITGB3, MDM2 and MMP2) were downregulated in the si-PSMA LNCap cells. There were 41 genes significantly upregulated and 15 genes downregulated in PC-3 cells when compared with LNCap cells. Eight common genes were found in both the si-PSMA and PSMA(-) groups. CDH6, MMP3, MTSS1 were further identified as PSMA-related genes in the prostate cancer cell lines and clinical samples, and their expression showed a negative correlation with the stage of prostate cancer (P<0.0001) and PSMA level (P<0.05) in clinical samples, indicating their possible involvement in PSMA-related PCa metastasis regulation.

Six of these genes had previously been reported as mutated in prostate cancer. The analysis also found significantly mutated androgen receptor (AR) cofactors and linked proteins, including FOXA1 and MLL2. Another finding concerned an aberration in CHD1.

These patients experience significant functional impairment and muscle atrophy, which may lead to an increased likelihood of skeletal complicaTIOns (i.e., pathological fracture, bone pain) and/or falls. Safe resistance exercise prescription may counteract this effect. The aim of this feasibility trial was to determine the safety and efficacy of resistance exercise by prostate cancer survivors with bone metastatic disease.  Methods:   Twenty men with established bone metastases secondary to prostate cancer were randomly assigned to a 12-week resistance exercise program in which exercise prescription was based on the location of bone lesions (n=10) or usual care (n=10). Outcomes included safety and tolerance of the exercise program, physical function, physical activity level, body composition, fatigue, quality of life and psychological distress. Outcomes were compared between groups using analysis of covariance adjusted for baseline values.  Results:   Participants had significant disease load with 65% of participants presenting with two or more regions affected by bone metastases and an average Gleason score of 8.2±0.9. Five participants (exercise=2; usual care=3) did not complete the intervention, three of which were due to advancing disease (exercise=2; usual care=1). No adverse events or skeletal complications occurred during the supervised exercise sessions. The exercise program was well tolerated as evidenced by high attendance (83%) and compliance rates (93%), and the ability of the participants to exercise at an intensity within the target range for cancer survivors (rating of perceived exertion =13.8±1.5). The change in physical function (muscle strength ∼11%; submaximal aerobic exercise capacity ∼5% and ambulation ∼12%), physical activity level (∼24%) and lean mass (∼3%) differed significantly between groups following the intervention, with favorable changes in the exercise group compared with the usual care group. No significant between-group differences were observed for fatigue, quality of life or psychological distress.  Conclusions:   This initial evidence involving a small sample size suggests that appropriately designed and supervised resistance exercise may be safe and well tolerated by prostate cancer patients with bone metastatic disease and can lead to improvements in physical function, physical activity levels and lean mass. Future trials involving larger sample sizes are required to expand these preliminary findings.""","""['P Cormie', 'R U Newton', 'N Spry', 'D Joseph', 'D R Taaffe', 'D A Galvão']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['Safety and efficacy of resistance exercise in prostate cancer patients with bone metastases.', 'Can supervised exercise prevent treatment toxicity in patients with prostate cancer initiating androgen-deprivation therapy: a randomised controlled trial.', 'Exercise Preserves Physical Function in Prostate Cancer Patients with Bone Metastases.', 'Functional benefits are sustained after a program of supervised resistance exercise in cancer patients with bone metastases: longitudinal results of a pilot study.', 'Effects of exercise on treatment-related adverse effects for patients with prostate cancer receiving androgen-deprivation therapy: a systematic review.', 'The development of an evidence-based physical self-management rehabilitation programme for cancer survivors.', 'Feasibility of home-based exercise training during adjuvant treatment for metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer patients treated with an androgen receptor pathway inhibitor (EXACT).', 'Dose-response relationship of resistance training for muscle morphology and strength in elderly cancer patients: A meta-analysis.', 'ExPeCT: a randomised trial examining the impact of exercise on quality of life in men with metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Exercise Intervention for Bone Metastasis: Safety, Efficacy and Method of Delivery.', 'Therapeutic validity and effectiveness of exercise interventions after lower limb-salvage surgery for sarcoma: a systematic review.']"""

Methods:   Of 175 men who underwent RARP between 2010 and 2011, 140 men completed the EPIC questionnaire preoperatively and 3, 6 and 12 months postoperatively. On the basis of the EPIC question no. 32 (item number 80), patients were divided into four groups according to the pattern of satisfaction change at postoperative 3 and 12 months: satisfied to satisfied (group 1); satisfied to dissatisfied (group 2); dissatisfied to satisfied (group 3); and dissatisfied to dissatisfied (group 4). Longitudinal changes in EPIC scores over time in each group and differences in EPIC scores of each domain subscale between groups at each follow-up were analyzed. A linear mixed model with generalized estimating equation approach was used to identify independent factors that influence overall satisfaction among repeated measures from same patients.  Results:   On the basis of the pattern of satisfaction change, groups 1, 2, 3 and 4 had 103 (74.3%), 21 (15.0%), 11 (7.9%) and 5 (2.9%) patients, respectively.

Although upregulation of SOX4 has been described in human prostate cancer (PCa), the prognostic value of SOX4 and its exact role in PCa progression remain unclear.  Methods:   Three tissue microarrays were constructed from 241 Chinese PCa patients who underwent TURP. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to detect the expression of SOX4. Genetic aberrations of epidermal growth factor receptor and HER2 were detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization. The effect of SOX4 on proliferation was evaluated by MTT (methyl thiazolyl tetrazelium), and cell migration and invasion were evaluated by transwell and wound-healing assays. The distribution of cell-cycle phase was analyzed by flow cytometry. Real-time PCR and western blot were used to study transcript and protein levels.  Results:   Using tissue microarray, we found that SOX4 was overexpressed in 33.0% (76/230) Chinese PCa patients by IHC. SOX4 overexpression was significantly associated with high Gleason scores (P=0.009) and the presence of distant metastasis (P=0.023). Additionally, SOX4 overexpression was significantly correlated with high Ki67 labeling index (P=0.005) and tended to associate with amplification of HER2 (P=0.052) in our cohort. Notably, SOX4 was correlated with cancer-specific mortality of PCa patients by Kaplan-Meier analysis (P=0.001). Multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that SOX4 was an unfavorable independent prognostic factor in Chinese PCas (P=0.017). SOX4 overexpression enhanced proliferation of Vcap cells and siRNA knockdown of SOX4 significantly decreased Vcap cell migration and invasion, suggesting a role of SOX4 in cancer metastasis. Additionally, flow cytometry DNA analysis revealed that siRNA SOX4 leads to significant accumulation of cells in the S phase and marked decrease of cells in the G2/M phase. Further in vitro study revealed that SOX4 silencing could inhibit TGF-β (transforming growth factor-β)-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in Vcap cells. Overexpression of SOX4 could promote the EMT phenotype in Vcap cells.  Conclusions:   Our results define an important role for SOX4 in the progression of PCa by orchestrating EMT and may serve as a prognostic marker for PCa patients.""","""['L Wang', 'J Zhang', 'X Yang', 'Y W Y Chang', 'M Qi', 'Z Zhou', 'J Zhang', 'B Han']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['MicroRNA-132/212 Upregulation Inhibits TGF-β-Mediated Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition of Prostate Cancer Cells by Targeting SOX4.', 'ERG-SOX4 interaction promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition in prostate cancer cells.', 'Metformin inhibits epithelial-mesenchymal transition in prostate cancer cells: involvement of the tumor suppressor miR30a and its target gene SOX4.', 'SOX4 is activated by C-MYC in prostate cancer.', 'SOXC Transcription Factors as Diagnostic Biomarkers and Therapeutic Targets for Arthritis.', 'New insights into KLFs and SOXs in cancer pathogenesis, stemness, and therapy.', 'Circ-ABCC4 contributes to prostate cancer progression and radioresistance by mediating miR-1253/SOX4 cascade.', 'FN1 promotes prognosis and radioresistance in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma: From radioresistant HNSCC cell line to integrated bioinformatics methods.', 'RUVBL1 promotes enzalutamide resistance of prostate tumors through the PLXNA1-CRAF-MAPK pathway.', 'Epithelial-mesenchymal transition and its transcription factors.']"""

The members include androgen receptor (AR), estrogen receptor (ER), glucocorticoid receptor (GR), mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), and progesterone receptor (PR). Phylogenetic studies demonstrate that AR, GR, MR, and PR are most closely related, falling into subgroup 3C. ER is more distantly related, falling into subgroup 3A. To determine the quantitative basis by which receptors generate their unique transcriptional responses, we are systematically dissecting the promoter-binding energetics of all receptors under a single ""standard state"" condition. Here, we examine the self-assembly and promoter-binding energetics of full-length AR and a mutant associated with prostate cancer, T877A. We first demonstrate that both proteins exist only as monomers, showing no evidence of dimerization. Although this result contradicts the traditional understanding that steroid receptors dimerize in the absence of DNA, it is fully consistent with our previous work demonstrating that GR and two PR isoforms either do not dimerize or dimerize only weakly. Moreover, both AR proteins exhibit substantial cooperativity between binding sites, again as seen for GR and PR. In sharp contrast, the more distantly related ER-α dimerizes so strongly that energetics can only be measured indirectly, yet cooperativity is negligible. Thus, homologous receptors partition their promoter-binding energetics quite differently. Moreover, since receptors most closely related by phylogeny partition their energetics similarly, such partitioning appears to be evolutionarily conserved. We speculate that such differences in energetics, coupled with different promoter architectures, serve as the basis for generating receptor-specific promoter occupancy and thus function.""","""['Rolando W De Angelis', 'Qin Yang', 'Michael T Miura', 'David L Bain']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Mol Biol""","""['Thermodynamic dissection of estrogen receptor-promoter interactions reveals that steroid receptors differentially partition their self-association and promoter binding energetics.', 'Glucocorticoid receptor-promoter interactions: energetic dissection suggests a framework for the specificity of steroid receptor-mediated gene regulation.', 'Homologous steroid receptors assemble at identical promoter architectures with unique energetics of cooperativity.', 'Non-canonical dimerization of the androgen receptor and other nuclear receptors: implications for human disease.', 'Hormone receptors in breast cancer: more than estrogen receptors.', 'Predicting the Activation of the Androgen Receptor by Mixtures of Ligands Using Generalized Concentration Addition.', 'Generalized concentration addition for ligands that bind to homodimers.', 'Steroid receptor-DNA interactions: toward a quantitative connection between energetics and transcriptional regulation.']"""

Methods:   Sixty-five patients with elevated serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and/or abnormal digital rectal examination (DRE) were assessed using transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) and CE-TRUS. In all the patients, CE-TRUS was performed with intravenous injection of contrast agent (SonoVue, 2.4 ml) before biopsy. The cancer detection rates of the two techniques were compared. False-positive and false-negative findings related to CE-TRUS were analyzed in comparison to the pathological results of biopsy or radical prostatectomy. The targeted biopsy to abnormal CE-TRUS areas was also compared to systematic biopsy.  Results:   Prostate cancer was detected in 29 of the 65 patients. CE-TRUS showed rapid focal enhancement or asymmetric vessels of peripheral zones in 28 patients; 23 of them had prostate cancer. CE-TRUS had 79.3% sensitivity, compared to 65.5% of TRUS (P<0.05). There were five false-positive and six false-negative findings from CE-TRUS. Benign prostate hyperplasia, and acute and chronic prostatitis were important causes related to the false-positive results of CE-TRUS. Prostate cancer originating from the transition zone or peripheral zone with lower PSA levels, small-size foci, and moderately or well-differentiated tumor was missed by CE-TRUS. The cancer detection rate of targeted biopsy (75%, 33/44 cores) was significantly higher than one of systematic biopsy (48.2%, 162/336) in those 28 cases (P<0.05). In addition, no significant correlation was found between the cancer detection rate with CE-TRUS and serum PSA levels.  Conclusion:   CE-TRUS may improve the detection rate of prostate cancer through targeted biopsy of contrast-enhanced abnormalities. Our findings indicate that systematic biopsies should not be eliminated on the basis of false-positive and false-negative findings related to CE-TRUS.""","""['Han-Xue Zhao', 'Chun-Xia Xia', 'Hong-Xia Yin', 'Ning Guo', 'Qiang Zhu']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Eur J Radiol""","""['Contrast-enhanced transrectal ultrasonography for the detection of diffuse prostate cancer.', 'Contrast-enhanced transrectal ultrasound (CE-TRUS) with cadence-contrast pulse sequence (CPS) technology for the identification of prostate cancer.', 'Real-time contrast-enhanced transrectal US-guided prostate biopsy: diagnostic accuracy in men with previously negative biopsy results and positive MR imaging findings.', 'MRI for troubleshooting detection of prostate cancer.', 'Contrast-enhanced versus systematic transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate cancer detection: an overview of techniques and a systematic review.', 'Novel non-MRI imaging techniques for primary diagnosis of prostate cancer: micro-ultrasound, contrast-enhanced ultrasound, elastography, multiparametric ultrasound, and PSMA PET/CT.', 'Focal cryotherapy for prostate cancer: a contemporary literature review.', 'Multiparametric ultrasound of prostate: role in prostate cancer diagnosis.', 'Application of Multiple Ultrasonic Techniques in the Diagnosis of Prostate Cancer.', 'Contrast-enhanced ultrasound evaluation of the prostate before transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy can improve diagnostic sensitivity: A STARD-compliant article.']"""

However, up to now only one certified treatment planning system supports mARC planning. We therefore present a conversion algorithm capable of converting IMRT plans created by any treatment planning system into mARC plans, with the hope of expanding the availability of mARC to a larger range of clinical users and researchers. As additional advantages, our implementation offers improved functionality for planning hybrid arcs and provides an equivalent step-and-shoot plan for each mARC plan, which can be used as a back-up concept in institutions where only one linac is equipped with mARC.  Methods:   We present a feasibility study to outline a practical implementation of mARC plan conversion using Philips Pinnacle and Prowess Panther. We present examples for three different kinds of prostate and head-and-neck plans, for 6 MV and flattening-filter-free (FFF) 7 MV photon energies, which are dosimetrically verified.  Results:   It is generally more difficult to create good quality IMRT plans in Pinnacle using a large number of beams and few segments. We present different ways of optimization as examples. By careful choosing the beam and segment arrangement and inversion objectives, we achieve plan qualities similar to our usual IMRT plans. The conversion of the plans to mARC format yields functional plans, which can be irradiated without incidences. Absolute dosimetric verification of both the step-and-shoot and mARC plans by point dose measurements showed deviations below 5% local dose, mARC plans deviated from step-and-shoot plans by no more than 1%. The agreement between GafChromic film measurements of planar dose before and after mARC conversion is excellent. The comparison of the 3D dose distribution measured by PTW Octavius 729 2D-Array with the step-and-shoot plans and with the TPS is well above the pass criteria of 90% of the points falling within 5% local dose and 3 mm distance to agreement. For all plans, the treatment time was noticeably reduced by conversion to mARC.  Conclusions:   We present the feasibility test for converting IMRT step-and-shoot plans from the RTP-output of any treatment planning system (Philips Pinnacle and Prowess Panther, in our case) into mARC plans. The feasibility and dosimetric equivalence is demonstrated for the examples of a prostate and a head-and-neck patient.""","""['Yvonne Dzierma', 'Frank Nuesken', 'Norbert Licht', 'Christian Ruebe']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Radiat Oncol""","""['VMAT to arclet plan conversion in a treatment planning system : Feasibility and dosimetric relationship between VMAT, arclet, and stationary fields.', 'mARC vs. IMRT radiotherapy of the prostate with flat and flattening-filter-free beam energies.', 'Treatment plan comparison between helical tomotherapy and MLC-based IMRT using radiobiological measures.', 'mARC prostate treatment planning with Varian Eclipse for flat vs. FFF beams.', 'Implementation of automatic plan optimization in Italy: Status and perspectives.', 'Monte Carlo verification of radiotherapy treatments with CloudMC.', 'VMAT to arclet plan conversion in a treatment planning system : Feasibility and dosimetric relationship between VMAT, arclet, and stationary fields.', 'Planning for mARC treatments with the Eclipse treatment planning system.', 'Erratum to: Evolution of educational inequalities in mortality among young adults in an urban setting.', 'mARC vs. IMRT radiotherapy of the prostate with flat and flattening-filter-free beam energies.']"""

In order to detect time trends and quality improvements between an early patient population (2003/2004) and a later reference group (2007/2008) data was analysed with regards to epidemiologic parameters, differences in diagnostics and the type and ranking of the recommended therapies taking into account changes to Gleason Grading System and implementation of new therapeutic strategies, particularly Active surveillance, in 2005.  Methods:   Data from all 496 consecutive patients who received consultation in 2003/2004 (n = 280) and 2007/2008 (n = 216) was retrospectively evaluated. Categorical variables were compared using the Chi-square test. Dependent variables were analysed using the unpaired Students´ t-test and the Mann-Whitney U-test.  Results:   The cohorts were comparable concerning clinical stage, initial PSA, prostate volume, comorbidities and organ confined disease. Patients in Cohort I were younger (66.44 vs. 69.31y; p < .001) and had a longer life expectancy (17.22 vs. 14.75y; p < .001). 50.9%, 28.2% and 20.9% in Cohort I and 37.2%, 39.6% and 23.2% in Cohort II showed low-, intermediate- and high-risk disease (D´Amico) with a trend towards an increased risk profile in Cohort II (p = .066). The risk-adapted therapy recommended as first option was radical prostatectomy for 91.5% in Cohort I and 69.7% in Cohort II, radiation therapy for 83.7% in Cohort I and 50.7% in Cohort II, and other therapies (brachytherapy, Active surveillance, Watchful waiting, high-intensity focused ultrasound) for 6.5% in Cohort I and 6.9% in Cohort II (p < .001). Radiation therapy was predominant in both cohorts as second treatment option (p < .001). Time trends showing quality improvement involved an increase in biopsy cores (9.95 ± 2.38 vs. 8.43 ± 2.29; p < .001) and an increased recommendation for bilateral nerve sparing (p < .001).  Conclusion:   In the earlier years, younger patients with a more favourable risk profile presented for interdisciplinary consultation.

Nevertheless, for some applications, bivalent antibodies perform much better, and for this, an Fc chain can be fused to the VHH domain, resulting in a bivalent homodimeric VHH-Fc complex. However, the production of bivalent antibodies in Escherichia coli is rather inefficient. Therefore, we compared the production of VHH7 and VHH7-Fc as antibodies of interest in Arabidopsis seeds for detecting prostate-specific antigen (PSA), a well-known biomarker for prostate cancer in the early stages of tumour development. The influence of the signal sequence (camel versus plant) and that of the Fc chain origin (human, mouse or pig) were evaluated. The accumulation levels of VHHs were very low, with a maximum of 0.13% VHH of total soluble protein (TSP) in homozygous T3 seeds, while VHH-Fc accumulation levels were at least 10- to 100-fold higher, with a maximum of 16.25% VHH-Fc of TSP. Both the camel and plant signal peptides were efficiently cleaved off and did not affect the accumulation levels. However, the Fc chain origin strongly affected the degree of proteolysis, but only had a slight influence on the accumulation level. Analysis of the mRNA levels suggested that the low amount of VHHs produced in Arabidopsis seeds was not due to a failure in transcription, but rather to translation inefficiency, protein instability and/or degradation. Most importantly, the plant-produced VHH7 and VHH7-Fc antibodies were functional in detecting PSA and could thus be used for diagnostic applications.""","""['Sylvie De Buck', 'Jonah Nolf', 'Thomas De Meyer', 'Vikram Virdi', 'Kirsten De Wilde', 'Els Van Lerberge', 'Bart Van Droogenbroeck', 'Ann Depicker']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Plant Biotechnol J""","""['Comparison of VHH-Fc antibody production in Arabidopsis thaliana, Nicotiana benthamiana and Pichia pastoris.', 'Production of camel-like antibodies in plants.', 'In vivo neutralization of α-cobratoxin with high-affinity llama single-domain antibodies (VHHs) and a VHH-Fc antibody.', 'Introduction to heavy chain antibodies and derived Nanobodies.', 'Expression of single-domain antibody in different systems.', 'Immunotherapeutic effects of recombinant colorectal cancer antigen produced in tomato fruits.', 'Reteplase Fc-fusions produced in N. benthamiana are able to dissolve blood clots ex vivo.', 'The Instability of Dimeric Fc-Fusions Expressed in Plants Can Be Solved by Monomeric Fc Technology.', 'Optimization of the human colorectal carcinoma antigen GA733-2 production in tobacco plants.', 'Applications of nanobodies in plant science and biotechnology.']"""

Studies to date have shown important roles of ERG in inducing oncogenic properties of prostate cancer. Its molecular mechanisms of action, however, are yet to be fully understood. Here, we report that ERG activates Wnt/LEF1 signaling cascade through multiple mechanisms. ERG bound to the promoters of various Wnt genes to directly increase ligand expression. Consequently, ERG overexpression increased active β-catenin level in the cells and enhanced TCF/LEF1 luciferase reporter activity, which could be partially blocked by WNT-3A inhibitor IWP-2. Most importantly, our data defined LEF1 as a direct target of ERG and that LEF1 inhibition fully abolished ERG-induced Wnt signaling and target gene expression. Furthermore, functional assays showed that Wnt/LEF1 activation phenocopied that of ERG in inducing cell growth, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and cell invasion, whereas blockade of Wnt signaling attenuated these effects.

The purpose of this study was to elucidate if these tumors harbor amplifications of the fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) gene, which has recently been identified as a potential therapeutic target in squamous cell lung cancer.  Methods:   One hundred twelve primary tumors (including squamous cell carcinoma [SCC], carcinoma associated with an inverted papilloma, sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma [SNUC], adenocarcinoma, adenoid cystic carcinoma [ACC], esthesioneuroblastoma, and 9 corresponding lymph node metastases) were assessed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for FGFR1 copy number status. Human papillomavirus (HPV) status was assessed by p16 immunohistochemical as a surrogate marker.  Results:   FGFR1 amplification was found in subsets of sinonasal SCCs (20%), carcinomas associated with an inverted papilloma (33%), and SNUCs (5%). In all cases, metastatic tumor samples shared the same FGFR1 amplification status as the corresponding primary tumor tissue. None of the FGFR1-amplified tumors expressed p16.

Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) trial 90401 (Alliance), a phase 3 trial in patients with mCRPC who received docetaxel-based chemotherapy, offered the opportunity to evaluate effect of prior ketoconazole, an earlier generation ASI, on clinical outcomes after docetaxel.  Methods:   In CALGB trial 90401, 1050 men with chemotherapy-naive mCRPC were randomized to receive treatment with docetaxel and prednisone that included either bevacizumab or placebo. In total, 1005 men (96%) had data available regarding prior ketoconazole therapy. The observed effects of prior ketoconazole on overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), prostate-specific antigen (PSA) decline, and the objective response rate (ORR) were assessed using proportional hazards and Poisson regression methods adjusted for validated prognostic factors and treatment arm.  Results:   Baseline characteristics between patients who did (N=277) and did not (N=728) receive prior ketoconazole therapy were similar. There were no statistically significant differences between patients who did and those who did not receive prior ketoconazole therapy with respect to OS (median OS, 21.1 months vs 22.3 months, respectively; stratified log-rank P=.635), PFS (median PFS, 8.1 months vs 8.6 months, respectively; stratified log-rank P=.342), the proportion achieving a decline ≥ 50% in PSA (61% vs 66%, respectively; relative risk, 1.09; adjusted P=.129), or ORR (39% vs 43%, respectively; relative risk, 1.11; adjusted P=.366).  Conclusions:   As measured by OS, PFS, PSA, and the ORR, there was no evidence that prior treatment with ketoconazole had an impact on the clinical outcomes of patients with mCRPC who received subsequent docetaxel-based therapy.

For these reasons, the authors investigated the degree to which these barriers impact the quality of prostate cancer care.  Methods:   The Veterans Affairs Central Cancer Registry was used to identify all men who were diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2008. Patient residence was characterized using Rural Urban Commuting Area codes. The authors then examined whether rural residence, compared with urban residence, was associated with less access to cancer-related resources and worse quality of care for 5 prostate cancer quality measures.  Results:   Approximately 25% of the 11,368 patients who were diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2008 lived in either a rural area or a large town. Rural patients tended to be white (62% urban vs 86% rural) and married (47% urban vs 63% rural), and they tended to have slightly higher incomes (all P<.01) but similar tumor grade (P=.23) and stage (P=.12) compared with urban patients. Rural patients were significantly less likely to be treated at facilities with comprehensive cancer resources, although they received a similar or better quality of care for 4 of the 5 prostate cancer quality measures. The time to prostate cancer treatment was similar (rural patients vs urban patients, 96.6 days vs 105.7 days).  Conclusions:   Rural patients with prostate cancer had less access to comprehensive oncology resources, although they received a similar quality of care, compared with their urban counterparts in the Veterans Health Administration integrated delivery system.

The cytokine interleukin 6 (IL6) can influence progression, differentiation, survival, and angiogenesis of PCa. To identify novel pathways that are triggered by IL6, we performed a gene expression profiling of two PCa cell lines, LNCaP and MDA PCa 2b, treated with 5 ng/ml IL6. Interferon (IFN) regulatory factor 9 (IRF9) was identified as one of the most prevalent IL6-regulated genes in both cell lines. IRF9 is a mediator of type I IFN signaling and acts together with STAT1 and 2 to activate transcription of IFN-responsive genes. The IL6 regulation of IRF9 was confirmed at mRNA and protein levels by quantitative real-time PCR and western blot respectively in both cell lines and could be blocked by the anti-IL6 antibody Siltuximab. Three PCa cell lines, PC3, Du-145, and LNCaP-IL6+, with an autocrine IL6 loop displayed high expression of IRF9. A tissue microarray with 36 PCa tissues showed that IRF9 protein expression is moderately elevated in malignant areas and positively correlates with the tissue expression of IL6. Downregulation and overexpression of IRF9 provided evidence for an IFN-independent role of IRF9 in cellular proliferation of different PCa cell lines. Furthermore, expression of IRF9 was essential to mediate the antiproliferative effects of IFNα2.

Methods:   The Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER)-Medicare linked database and the American Medical Association Physician Masterfile were used in a retrospective analysis of 5531 patients with low-risk, clinically localized prostate cancer who were diagnosed between 2004 and 2007, and the 708 ROs who treated them. Hierarchical logistic regression analyses were used to evaluate the relationship between patient and RO characteristics and the use of combined therapy within 6 months of diagnosis.  Results:   Overall, 356 patients (6.4%) received combined therapy. Nonclinical factors were found to be associated with combined therapy. After adjusting for patient and RO characteristics, the odds of receiving combined therapy for patients residing in Georgia were found to be significantly greater than for all other SEER regions. Black patients were significantly less likely to receive combined therapy (odds ratio, 0.62; 95% confidence interval, 0.40-0.96 [P= .03]) compared with white patients. In addition, ROs accounted for 36.6% of the variation in patients receiving combined therapy.

Tumor-to-tumor metastasis was found in five of six renal cell carcinomas (83 %), one of eight thyroid papillary carcinomas (13 %), one of three adrenocortical adenomas (33 %), one of three pancreatic endocrine microadenomas (33 %), and another lung cancer (one of six cases of multiple lung cancers, 17 %).

However, prostate cancer cells with a propensity for bone metastasis express high levels of cadherin-11 and reduced levels of E-cadherin. Downregulation of cadherin-11 inhibits interaction of prostate cancer cells with osteoblasts in vitro and homing of prostate cancer cells to bone in an animal model of metastasis. These findings indicate that targeting cadherin-11 may prevent prostate cancer bone metastasis. To explore this possibility, a panel of 21 monoclonal antibodies (mAb) was generated against the extracellular (EC) domain of cadherin-11. Two antibodies, mAbs 2C7 and 1A5, inhibited cadherin-11-mediated cell-cell aggregation in vitro using L-cells transfected with cadherin-11. Both antibodies demonstrated specificity to cadherin-11, and neither antibody recognized E-cadherin or N-cadherin on C4-2B or PC3 cells, respectively. Furthermore, mAb 2C7 inhibited cadherin-11-mediated aggregation between the highly metastatic PC3-mm2 cells and MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts. Mechanistically, a series of deletion mutants revealed a unique motif, aa 343-348, in the cadherin-11 EC3 domain that is recognized by mAb 2C7 and that this motif coordinated cell-cell adhesion. Importantly, administration of mAb 2C7 in a prophylactic setting effectively prevented metastasis of PC3-mm2 cells to bone in an in vivo mouse model.

The microchannel surface was firstly modified with a prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA) monoclonal antibody as the recognition element for prostate cancer cells (PC-3). As a result of the antigen-antibody specific affinity interactions, PC-3 cells could be selectively captured on the microchannel surface. After cell capture, nano-sized graphene oxide-poly(ethylene glycol) bis(amine) (NGO-PEG) was employed as a quencher and carrier of a signal tag, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled antisense oligonucleotide (F-S1), which is complementary to part of survivin mRNA (target survivin mRNA), to transfect into the captured PC-3 cells. Upon the selective binding of S1 to intracellular survivin mRNA, F-S1 will be released from the NGO-PEG, inducing the fluorescence recovery of FITC. This antibody-based microfluidic device enables simple and inexpensive monitoring of the amount of survivin mRNA in single captured cell without the need for sample pretreatment. The survivin mRNA content in each PC-3 cell was estimated to be (4.8 ± 1.8) × 10(6) copies. This strategy opens a different perspective for ultrasensitive survivin mRNA detection, which may facilitate the early screening for malignancy.""","""['Xiang-Ling Li', 'Shu Shan', 'Meng Xiong', 'Xing-Hua Xia', 'Jing-juan Xu', 'Hong-Yuan Chen']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Lab Chip""","""[""Switchable 'on-off-on' electrochemical technique for direct detection of survivin mRNA in living cells."", 'Sensitive electrochemiluminescence detection of c-Myc mRNA in breast cancer cells on a wireless bipolar electrode.', 'Visual and high-throughput detection of cancer cells using a graphene oxide-based FRET aptasensing microfluidic chip.', 'Toward early cancer detection: Focus on biosensing systems and biosensors for an anti-apoptotic protein survivin and survivin mRNA.', 'Target Confinement in Small Reaction Volumes Using Microfluidic Technologies: A Smart Approach for Single-Entity Detection and Analysis.', 'Advances in Electrochemical Nano-Biosensors for Biomedical and Environmental Applications: From Current Work to Future Perspectives.', 'Advances in Cancer Diagnosis: Bio-Electrochemical and Biophysical Characterizations of Cancer Cells.', 'A Two-Dimensional Affinity Capture and Separation Mini-Platform for the Isolation, Enrichment, and Quantification of Biomarkers and Its Potential Use for Liquid Biopsy.']"""

This iterative trial-and-error nature of radiotherapy treatment planning results in an inefficient planning process and in order to reduce such inefficiency, plans can be accepted without achieving the best attainable quality. We propose a quality assessment method based on data envelopment analysis (DEA) to address this inefficiency. This method compares a plan of interest to a set of past delivered plans and searches for evidence of potential further improvement. With the assistance of DEA, planners will be able to make informed decisions on whether further planning is required and ensure that a plan is only accepted when the plan quality is close to the best attainable one. We apply the DEA method to 37 prostate plans using two assessment parameters: rectal generalized equivalent uniform dose (gEUD) as the input and D95 (the minimum dose that is received by 95% volume of a structure) of the planning target volume (PTV) as the output. The percentage volume of rectum overlapping PTV is used to account for anatomical variations between patients and is included in the model as a non-discretionary output variable. Five plans that are considered of lesser quality by DEA are re-optimized with the goal to further improve rectal sparing. After re-optimization, all five plans improve in rectal gEUD without clinically considerable deterioration of the PTV D95 value. For the five re-optimized plans, the rectal gEUD is reduced by an average of 1.84 Gray (Gy) with only an average reduction of 0.07 Gy in PTV D95. The results demonstrate that DEA can correctly identify plans with potential improvements in terms of the chosen input and outputs.""","""['Kuan-Min Lin', 'John Simpson', 'Giuseppe Sasso', 'Andrea Raith', 'Matthias Ehrgott']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Volumetric modulated arc therapy: planning and evaluation for prostate cancer cases.', 'Biological optimization in volumetric modulated arc radiotherapy for prostate carcinoma.', 'Simultaneous beam geometry and intensity map optimization in intensity-modulated radiation therapy.', 'Considerations for using data envelopment analysis for the assessment of radiotherapy treatment plan quality.', 'Benefit of using biologic parameters (EUD and NTCP) in IMRT optimization for treatment of intrahepatic tumors.', 'Automation in intensity modulated radiotherapy treatment planning-a review of recent innovations.']"""

This study developed a mathematical model to estimate future changes in urologic oncologic surgeon (UOS) manpower and analyzed the effect of those changes on per-UOS case volumes.  Materials and methods:   SUO fellowship program directors were queried as to the number of positions available on an annual basis. Current US UOS manpower was estimated from the SUO membership list. Future manpower was estimated on an annual basis by linear senescence of existing manpower combined with linear growth of newly trained surgeons. Case-volume estimates for the 4 surgical disease sites (prostate, kidney/renal pelvis, bladder, and testes) were obtained from the literature. The future number of major cases was determined from current volumes based upon the US population growth rates and the historic average annual change in disease incidence. Two models were used to predict future per-UOS major case volumes. Model 1 assumed the current distribution of cases between nononcologic surgeons and UOS would continue. Model 2 assumed a progressive redistribution of cases over time such that in 2043 100% of major urologic cancer cases would be performed by UOSs.  Results:   Over the 30-year period to ""manpower steady-state"" SUO-accredited UOSs practicing in the United States have the potential to increase from approximately 600 currently to 1,650 in 2043. During this interval, case volumes are predicted to change 0.97-, 2.4-, 1.1-, and 1.5-fold for prostatectomy, nephrectomy, cystectomy, and retroperitoneal lymph node dissection, respectively. The ratio of future to current total annual case volumes is predicted to be 0.47 and 0.9 for models 1 and 2, respectively. The number of annual US practicing graduates necessary to achieve a future to current case-volume ratio greater than 1 is 25 and 49 in models 1 and 2, respectively.  Conclusions:   The current number of SUO fellowship trainees has the potential to decrease future per-UOS case volumes relative to current levels.

We aimed to assess trends in PSA screening frequency amongst primary care physicians (PCPs) surrounding the May 2012 USPSTF recommendation.  Methods and materials:   The electronic data warehouse was used to identify men aged between 40 and 79 years with no history of prostate cancer or urology visit who were evaluated by an internal medicine or family practice physician between 2007 and 2012. Analyses were directed toward PSA testing within 6-month time period from June to November, with particular focus on the 2011 (pre-USPSTF recommendation) and 2012 (post-USPSTF recommendation) cohorts. The primary outcome measure was proportion of men with at least 1 PSA test during the 6-month pre- and post-USPSTF recommendation periods.  Results:   A total of 112,221 men met inclusion criteria. There was a significant decrease in screening frequency between the 2011 and 2012 cohorts (8.6% vs. 7.6%, P = 0.0001; adjusted odds ratio 0.89, 95% confidence interval 0.83-0.95).

Methods and materials:   We studied 25 patients with PV <25 cc (range, 15.1-24.8) and 65 patients with PV ≥25 cc (range, 25.0-66.2) based on three-dimensional ultrasound contours who underwent brachytherapy monotherapy with intraoperative planning. Postoperative Days 1 and 30 dosimetry was done by CT-MRI fusion.  Results:   Small PVs had greater Day 1 swelling than large PVs (32.5% increase in volume vs. 23.7%, p = 0.04), but by Day 30, swelling was minimal and not significantly different (p = 0.44). Small PVs had greater seed and needle densities at implant (p < 0.001). Rectal and urethral doses were nearly identical by Day 30 (small PV rectum receiving 100% of the prescription dose [145 Gy] [V100] = 0.32 cc; large PV rectum V100 = 0.33 cc, p = 0.99; small PV urethra receiving 150% of the prescription dose [145 Gy] [V150] = 0.20, large PV urethra V150 = 0.20, p = 0.91). Swelling at Day 1 created some cool implants (rate dose that covers 90% of the prostate volume [D90 <140 Gy = 12.0% and 9.4% for the small and large PV groups, respectively, p = 0.71), but Day 30 planning target volume coverage was excellent (rate D90 <140 Gy = 0% for both groups).  Conclusions:   Although smaller prostates have greater Day 1 swelling, good Day 30 dosimetry can be achieved, making them excellent candidates for (125)I seeds (half-life [t½] = 60 days).

Furthermore, the data were used to define a bivariate logistic regression model in which the presence (>50% collagen amount for each patients) or absence (≤50% collagen amount) of fibrosis was analyzed after adjusting for clinical and pathological variables.  Results:   A significant difference was found between the two groups in terms of International Prostatic Symptoms Score (P < 0.05) and urodynamics findings (all P < 0.05).

Using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), the purity and content of crocin were determined. All cells were incubated with different concentrations of SE or crocin for 48 h. Cell cycle and apoptosis were also evaluated. In a time- and concentration-dependent manner, both SE and crocin reduced cell proliferation in all malignant cell lines with IC50 values ranging between 0.4 and 4 mg/ml for SE and between 0.26 and 0.95 mM/ml for crocin. Nonmalignant cells were not affected. Flow cytometry profiles revealed that most cells were arrested at G0/G1 phase with a significant presence of apoptotic cells. Western blot analysis revealed that the expression of Bcl-2 was strikingly downregulated, whereas Bax was upregulated. Analysis of caspase activity indicated a caspase-dependent pathway with involvement of caspase-9 activation, suggesting an intrinsic pathway. Based on these findings, it can be concluded that both SE and crocin can inhibit cell proliferation, arrest cell cycle progression, inducing apoptosis in prostate cancer.

In the kidney, this mechanism regulates serum 25D3 levels and production of 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (1,25D3) by CYP27B1 for systemic use. Previously, we showed that mammary epithelial cells expressing CYP27B1 express megalin and Dab2 and internalize DBP by endocytosis, indicating 25D3 was accessible for conversion to 1,25D3 in extra-renal tissues. Moreover, induction of megalin and Dab2 (protein and mRNA abundance) by all-trans-retinoic acid (RA) enhanced DBP uptake. This suggests megalin and Dab2 play a central role in uptake of vitamin D and may predict actions of vitamin D in extra-renal tissues. Here, we characterized megalin and Dab2 expression and uptake of DBP in transformed human prostate and colon epithelial cells. Megalin and Dab2 were expressed in prostate and colon epithelial cells, which was markedly enhanced following treatment with RA. Furthermore, DBP uptake was stimulated by low-dose RA supplementation in LNCaP, PC-3, and Caco-2 cells. Taken together, these are the first studies to our knowledge that have demonstrated modulated expression of megalin and Dab2, as well as an association between increased expression of endocytic proteins with DBP uptake in prostate and colon cells.""","""['Shantel B Ternes', 'Matthew J Rowling']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Nutr Cancer""","""['Megalin and Vitamin D Metabolism-Implications in Non-Renal Tissues and Kidney Disease.', 'Retinoids modulate expression of the endocytic partners megalin, cubilin, and disabled-2 and uptake of vitamin D-binding protein in human mammary cells.', 'Dietary resistant starch prevents urinary excretion of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol and vitamin D-binding protein in type 1 diabetic rats.', 'Cubilin-, megalin-, and Dab2-dependent transcription revealed by CRISPR/Cas9 knockout in kidney proximal tubule cells.', 'Proximal tubule endocytic apparatus as the specific renal uptake mechanism for vitamin D-binding protein/25-(OH)D3 complex.', 'Expression Pattern of DAB Adaptor Protein 2 in Left- and Right-Side Colorectal Carcinoma.', 'Nongenomic Activities of Vitamin D.', 'Megalin and Vitamin D Metabolism-Implications in Non-Renal Tissues and Kidney Disease.', 'Prediagnostic Circulating Concentrations of Vitamin D Binding Protein and Survival among Patients with Colorectal Cancer.', 'Vitamin D-Related Genes, Blood Vitamin D Levels and Colorectal Cancer Risk in Western European Populations.']"""

Qualitative research indicates the importance of increased compassion as a result of struggling with challenges presented by cancer and treatments. However, current PTG measures may not adequately assess compassion.  Methods:   A cross-sectional survey of 514 prostate cancer survivors assessed the PTGI and Dispositional Positive Emotional Scale (DPES). Five additional PTG items were derived from previous qualitative research to assess increased compassion.  Results:   After removing eight items with complex loadings, a principal components analysis with oblimin rotation revealed a six-component structure. A clear delineation was seen between components relating to compassion, new possibilities, relating to others, personal strength, appreciation of life and spiritual change. Compassion accounted for 48.9 % of variance in data, with the overall model accounting for 79.9 % of variance. Strong factorability was demonstrated through Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (0.92) and Bartlett's test of sphericity (approximate χ (2) = 5,791.85, df 153, p < 0.001). The six-component structure was validated with a confirmatory factor analysis. Strong internal consistency was evidenced through Cronbach's alpha coefficients ranging from 0.74 to 0.90 for subscales, and item-to-total correlations and inter-item correlations exceeded accepted thresholds of 0.50 and 0.30, respectively.

Methods:   Since May 2012, 17 prostate cancer patients were treated with helical tomotherapy. The exclusion criteria used are the following: Gleason score ≥8, PSA >20 ng/ml, cT3b-4, IPSS ≥20 and history of acute urinary retention. CTV included the prostate gland and 1 cm of seminal vesicles in the low-risk group (LR) or the seminal vesicles completely in the intermediate (IR) and high-risk (HR) NCCN groups. CTV margins ranged from 2 to 8 mm, while PTV margins were 2 to 9 mm. Patients received eight fractions of 5.48 Gy (LR) or 5.65 Gy (IR, HR) on alternate days. Total equivalent doses at 2 Gy per fraction are 87.4 for LR and 92.3 Gy for IR-HR using an α/β value of 1.5. Correspondent figures for a α/β of 3 are 74.3 Gy and 78.2 Gy, respectively.

Using human (C4-2B/THP1) and mouse (TRAMP-C1/RAW264.7) PCa cells-macrophages co-culture systems, we found currently used anti-androgens, MDV3100 (enzalutamide) or Casodex (bicalutamide), promoted macrophage migration to PCa cells that consequently led to enhanced PCa cell invasion. In contrast, the AR degradation enhancer, ASC-J9, suppressed both macrophage migration and subsequent PCa cell invasion. Mechanism dissection showed that Casodex/MDV3100 reduced the AR-mediated PIAS3 expression and enhanced the pSTAT3-CCL2 pathway. Addition of CCR2 antagonist reversed the Casodex/MDV3100-induced macrophage migration and PCa cell invasion.

These findings were confirmed in the in vivo mouse model with orthotopically injected TRAMP-C1 cells. Together, these results may raise the potential concern about the currently used ADT with anti-androgens that promotes PCa metastasis and may provide some new and better therapeutic strategies using ASC-J9 alone or a combinational therapy that simultaneously targets androgens/AR signaling and PIAS3-pSTAT3-CCL2 signaling to better battle PCa growth and metastasis at castration-resistant stage.""","""['T-H Lin', 'K Izumi', 'S O Lee', 'W-J Lin', 'S Yeh', 'C Chang']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Cell Death Dis""","""['Differential androgen deprivation therapies with anti-androgens casodex/bicalutamide or MDV3100/Enzalutamide versus anti-androgen receptor ASC-J9(R) Lead to promotion versus suppression of prostate cancer metastasis.', 'ASC-J9(®), and not Casodex or Enzalutamide, suppresses prostate cancer stem/progenitor cell invasion via altering the EZH2-STAT3 signals.', 'Targeting fatty acid synthase with ASC-J9 suppresses proliferation and invasion of prostate cancer cells.', 'A review of the effects and molecular mechanisms of dimethylcurcumin (ASC-J9) on androgen receptor-related diseases.', 'Darolutamide as a Second-Generation Androgen Receptor Inhibitor in the Treatment of Prostate Cancer.', 'Osteoid cell-derived chemokines drive bone-metastatic prostate cancer.', 'The Role of MRE11 in the IL-6/STAT3 Pathway of Lung Cancer Cells.', 'Suppression of androgen receptor signaling induces prostate cancer migration via activation of the CCL20-CCR6 axis.', 'AR Structural Variants and Prostate Cancer.', 'CC Chemokine Ligand-2: A Promising Target for Overcoming Anticancer Drug Resistance.']"""

Here, we demonstrate that Mar potently inhibited chymotrypsin-like and peptidyl-glutamyl peptide-hydrolyzing activities of 20S proteasome both in in vitro and intracellular systems and significantly induced the accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins in PCa cells. The computational modeling analysis suggested that Mar non-covalently bound to active sites of proteasome β5 and β1 subunits, resulting in a non-competitive inhibition. Proteasome inhibition by Mar subsequently resulted in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, as evidenced by elevated glucose-regulated protein 78 and CHOP, increased phospho-eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α (eIF(2α)), splicing of X-box-binding protein-1 and dilation of the ER. However, Mar-mediated cell death was not completely impaired by a pan inhibitor of caspases. Further studies revealed that the Mar-induced cell death was greatly associated with the activation of autophagy, as indicated by the significant induction of microtubule-associated protein-1 light chain-3 beta (LC3B) expression and conversion. Electron microscopic and green fluorescent protein-tagged LC3B analyses further demonstrated the ability of autophagy induction by Mar. Time kinetic studies revealed that Mar induced a rapid and highly sustained processing of LC3B in treated cells and simultaneously decreased the expression of p62/SQSTM1. Pharmacological blockade or knockdown of LC3B and Atg5 attenuated Mar-mediated cell death. The autophagic response triggered by Mar required the activation of RNA-dependent protein kinase-like ER kinase/eIF(2α) and suppression of the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin axis via preventing activation and expression of Akt.

It induces differentiation and apoptosis in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) cells. The NO prodrug O(2) -(2,4-dinitrophenyl)1-((4-ethoxycarbonyl)piperazin-1-yl)diazen-1-ium-1,2-diolate, or JS-K, has potent antileukaemic activity. JS-K is also active in vitro and in vivo against multiple myeloma, prostate cancer, non-small-cell lung cancer, glioma and liver cancer. Using the Pluronic P123 polymer, we have developed a micelle formulation for JS-K to increase its solubility and stability. The goal of the current study was to investigate the cellular distribution of JS-K in AML cells.  Methods:   We investigated the intracellular distribution of JS-K (free drug) and JS-K formulated in P123 micelles (P123/JS-K) using HL-60 AML cells. We also studied the S-glutathionylating effects of JS-K on proteins in the cytoplasmic and nuclear cellular fractions.  Key findings:   Both free JS-K and P123/JS-K accumulate primarily in the nucleus. Both free JS-K and P123/JS-K induced S-glutathionylation of nuclear proteins, although the effect produced was more pronounced with P123/JS-K. Minimal S-glutathionylation of cytoplasmic proteins was observed.  Conclusions:   We conclude that a micelle formulation of JS-K increases its accumulation in the nucleus. Post-translational protein modification through S-glutathionylation may contribute to JS-K's antileukaemic properties.""","""['Imit Kaur', 'Moises Terrazas', 'Ken M Kosak', 'Steven E Kern', 'Kenneth M Boucher', 'Paul J Shami']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Pharm Pharmacol""","""['Effect of a Pluronic(®) P123 formulation on the nitric oxide-generating drug JS-K.', 'JS-K, a glutathione/glutathione S-transferase-activated nitric oxide donor of the diazeniumdiolate class with potent antineoplastic activity.', 'Nitric oxide-releasing prodrug triggers cancer cell death through deregulation of cellular redox balance.', 'The nitric oxide prodrug JS-K and its structural analogues as cancer therapeutic agents.', 'Recent progress in drug delivery of pluronic P123: pharmaceutical perspectives.', 'Opportunities for Nitric Oxide in Potentiating Cancer Immunotherapy.', 'Glutathione-S-Transferases as Potential Targets for Modulation of Nitric Oxide-Mediated Vasodilation.', 'A review of the relatively complex mechanism of JS-K induced apoptosis in cancer cells.', 'Role of human glutathione transferases in biotransformation of the nitric oxide prodrug JS-K.', 'Glutathione S-transferase π: a potential role in antitumor therapy.']"""

Some of these analogues may be useful as antineoplastic agents after appropriate targeting as peptide conjugated prodrugs to cancer cells. With this in mind, this study evaluates the effect on LNCaP androgen-sensitive cancer cells of thapsigargin substituted with 12-aminododecanoyl linkers and Leu (Leu-8ADT), aspartate (Asp-8ADT) or Boc-8ADT. Our results show that both Leu-8ADT and Asp-8ADT result in rapid ER calcium depletion and an influx of calcium across the plasma membrane by activation of store-operated calcium entry. By contrast, ER Ca(2+) depletion by Boc-8ADT is a very slow process that does not perceptibly increase cytosolic Ca(2+) and activate store-operated calcium entry, because the inhibition of SERCA with this compound is very slow. Nevertheless, we find that Boc-8ADT is a more efficient inducer of apoptosis than both Tg and Leu-8ADT. Compared with Tg and the other analogues, apoptosis induced by Asp-8ADT is very modest, although this compound also activates store-operated calcium entry and at high concentrations (1 μm) causes severe morphological changes, reflecting decreased cell viability. We conclude that many factors need to be considered for optimization of these compounds in antineoplastic drug design. Among these ER stress induced by Ca(2+) endoplasmic reticulum mobilization seems particularly important, whereas the early cytosolic increase of Ca(2+) concentration preceding the executive phase of apoptosis appears to be of no, or little, consequence for a subsequent apoptotic effect.""","""['Charlotte Dubois', 'Fabien Vanden Abeele', 'Pankaj Sehgal', 'Claus Olesen', 'Steffen Junker', 'Søren B Christensen', 'Natalia Prevarskaya', 'Jesper V Møller']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""FEBS J""","""['Inhibition of the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+-ATPase by thapsigargin analogs induces cell death via ER Ca2+ depletion and the unfolded protein response.', 'The role of calcium, pH, and cell proliferation in the programmed (apoptotic) death of androgen-independent prostatic cancer cells induced by thapsigargin.', 'Role of endoplasmic reticulum calcium content in prostate cancer cell growth regulation by IGF and TNFalpha.', 'Targeting thapsigargin towards tumors.', 'The SERCA pump as a therapeutic target: making a ""smart bomb"" for prostate cancer.', 'Thapsigargin-From Traditional Medicine to Anticancer Drug.', 'Various Aspects of Calcium Signaling in the Regulation of Apoptosis, Autophagy, Cell Proliferation, and Cancer.', ""Co-targeting Mitochondrial Ca2+ Homeostasis and Autophagy Enhances Cancer Cells' Chemosensitivity."", 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Calcium Pumps and Tumor Cell Differentiation.', 'Blockade of Oncogenic NOTCH1 with the SERCA Inhibitor CAD204520 in T Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia.']"""

Here, the authors demonstrate the efficacy of ultrasound at a clinically relevant frequency to quantitatively detect changes in tumors in response to cancer therapies using preclinical mouse models.  Methods:   Conventional low-frequency and corresponding high-frequency ultrasound (ranging from 4 to 28 MHz) were used along with quantitative spectroscopic and signal envelope statistical analyses on data obtained from xenograft tumors treated with chemotherapy, x-ray radiation, as well as a novel vascular targeting microbubble therapy.  Results:   Ultrasound-based spectroscopic biomarkers indicated significant changes in cell-death associated parameters in responsive tumors. Specifically changes in the midband fit, spectral slope, and 0-MHz intercept biomarkers were investigated for different types of treatment and demonstrated cell-death related changes. The midband fit and 0-MHz intercept biomarker derived from low-frequency data demonstrated increases ranging approximately from 0 to 6 dBr and 0 to 8 dBr, respectively, depending on treatments administrated. These data paralleled results observed for high-frequency ultrasound data. Statistical analysis of ultrasound signal envelope was performed as an alternative method to obtain histogram-based biomarkers and provided confirmatory results. Histological analysis of tumor specimens indicated up to 61% cell death present in the tumors depending on treatments administered, consistent with quantitative ultrasound findings indicating cell death. Ultrasound-based spectroscopic biomarkers demonstrated a good correlation with histological morphological findings indicative of cell death (r2=0.71, 0.82; p<0.001).

Methods:   The reconstruction problem is formulated as a least-square L1-type optimization problem, with the tensor framelet for the image regularization, which is a generalization of L1, total variation, and wavelet. The high-order derivatives of the image are simultaneously regularized in L1 norm at multilevel along the x, y, and z directions. This convex formulation is efficiently solved using the Split Bregman method. In addition, a GPU-based parallel algorithm was developed to accelerate image reconstruction. The new method was compared with the filtered backprojection and the total variation based method in both phantom and patient studies with full or partial projection views.  Results:   The tensor framelet based method improved the image quality from the filtered backprojection and the total variation based method. The new method was robust when only 25% of the projection views were used. It required ∼2 min for the GPU-based solver to reconstruct a 40-slice 1 mm-resolution 350×350 3D image with 200 projection views per slice and 528 detection pixels per view.  Conclusions:   The authors have developed a GPU-based tensor framelet reconstruction method with improved image quality for the megavoltage CT imaging on TomoTherapy with full or undersampled projection views.

In this paper, Co-60 tomotherapy's conformal dose delivery potential is evaluated by delivering conformal dose plans on a cylindrical homogeneous phantom containing clinical structures similar to those found in a typical head and neck (H&N) cancer. Also, the clinical potential of Co-60 tomotherapy is investigated by generating 2D clinical treatment plans for H&N and prostate anatomical regions. These plans are compared with the 6 MV based treatment plans for modalities such as linear accelerator-based tomotherapy and broad beam IMRT, and 15 MV based 3D conformal radiation therapy (3DCRT).  Methods:   For experimental validation studies, clinical and nonclinical conformal dose patterns were delivered on circular, homogeneous phantoms containing GafChromic film. For clinical planning study, dose calculations were performed with the EGSnrc Monte Carlo program, where a Theratronics 780C Co-60 unit and a 6 MV linear accelerator were modeled with a MIMiC binary multileaf collimator. An inhouse inverse treatment planning system was used to optimize tomotherapy plans using the same optimization parameters for both Co-60 and 6 MV beams. The IMRT and 3DCRT plans for the clinical cases were generated entirely in the Eclipse treatment planning system based on inhouse IMRT and 3DCRT site specific protocols.  Results:   The doses delivered to the homogeneous phantoms agreed with the calculations, indicating that it is possible to deliver highly conformal doses with the Co-60 unit. The dose distributions for Co-60 tomotherapy clinical plans for both clinical cases were similar to those obtained with 6 MV based tomotherapy and IMRT, and much more conformal compared to 3DCRT plans. The dose area histograms showed that the Co-60 plans achieve the dose objectives for the targets and organs at risk.  Conclusions:   These results confirm that Co-60 tomotherapy is capable of providing state-of-the-art conformal dose delivery and could be used for the treatment of targets in both small and larger separation anatomical regions.""","""['Sandeep Dhanesar', 'Johnson Darko', 'Chandra P Joshi', 'Andrew Kerr', 'L John Schreiner']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Clinical implementation of intensity-modulated arc therapy.', 'Comparative analysis of 60Co intensity-modulated radiation therapy.', 'Aperture superposition dose model versus pencil beam superposition dose model for a finite size Cobalt-60 source for tomotherapy deliveries.', 'Intensity modulated radiotherapy with dynamic multileaf collimator.

Results:   The authors show by experimental comparisons, carried out retrospectively for a set of prostate cancer patients, that their proposed model corresponds well with constraining dosimetric indices. All modifications of the parameters in the authors' model yield the expected result.

Results:   As2 O3 inhibited the proliferation of PC-3 cells in a concentration- and time-dependent manner, and quickly activated P38 phosphorylation, thus giving full play to its biological activities. After 24 hours of treatment with As2 O3 at the concentrations of 2, 10 and 20 micromol/L, the apoptosis rates of the PC-3 cells were (18.9 +/- 0.43), (24.7 +/- 0.29) and (49.7 +/- 1.79)%, respectively, which were reduced to (14.8 +/- 0.81), (22.1 +/- 0.51) and (39.6 +/- 1.74)% after interfering the P38 pathway with SB203580.

Aims:   To observe the effects of the RAPC on prostate cancer diagnosis, primary treatment and overall workload.  Methods:   Using a prospectively designed patient database, the records of all prostate cancer patients between 2007 and 2011 were retrieved and analysed. Data were obtained for age, PSA, biopsy Gleason score and primary treatment modality and charted for the observation and comparison of trends.  Results:   Seven hundred and eighty-nine patients had a new diagnosis of prostate cancer between 2007 and 2011. The median PSA prior to the RAPC was 9.7-13.1 ng/ml, which decreased to 7.79-9 ng/ml after the RAPC. Prior to the RAPC, 77-81 biopsies were performed annually versus 149-271 in the post-RAPC era. Annual requirements for radical prostatectomy also increased from 12 to 27 in the post-RAPC era. Conversely, an initially increasing percentage of patients for radiotherapy was reversed in the post-RAPC period. An increasing trend for higher grade PCa (Gleason score 4 + 4 and higher) was also reversed.  Conclusions:   The introduction of a RAPC improves the overall pathological characteristics of patients with prostate cancer. However, RAPCs are also associated with a considerable increase in surgical workload. These are important considerations for units considering the incorporation of a similar facility in their institutions.""","""['S F Oon', 'I M Cullen', 'D Moran', 'E M Bolton', 'T McDermott', 'R Grainger', 'T H Lynch']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Ir J Med Sci""","""['The effect of Rapid Access Prostate Clinics on the outcomes of Gleason 7 prostate cancer: does earlier diagnosis lead to better outcomes?', 'A rapid access diagnostic clinic for prostate cancer: the experience after one year.', 'Management of localised prostate cancer: watchful waiting, surgery or radiation therapy, depending on the natural course, which is often relatively slow.', 'Comparison of Pathological and Oncologic Outcomes of Favorable Risk Gleason Score 3 + 4 and Low Risk Gleason Score 6 Prostate Cancer: Considerations for Active Surveillance.', 'Contemporary grading for prostate cancer: implications for patient care.', ""Oncological Outcomes of Open Radical Retropubic Prostatectomy in Ireland: A Single Surgeon's 5-Year Experience."", 'How do the characteristics of breast cancer diagnostic assessment programmes influence service delivery: A mixed methods study.', 'The effect of Rapid Access Prostate Clinics on the outcomes of Gleason 7 prostate cancer: does earlier diagnosis lead to better outcomes?']"""

We then knocked down their AR with siRNA and co-cultured the resultant CAFs with PCa cell line PC3. The MTT, invasion, and colony formation assays were performed to study the PC3 biological behavior. The results showed that the PCa epithelial growth, invasion, and colony formation abilities decreased when knocking down the CAFs AR. By using the real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, we found the IGF1, FGF7, FGF10, SDF1, HGF, and TGFb2 expression levels decreased in the AR knocked down CAFs.

This study evaluates the prevalence of UI and the impact on HRQOL among older cancer survivors.  Methods:   The prevalence of UI among cancer survivors (breast, prostate, bladder, colorectal, lung, and endometrial/uterine cancers) and those without cancer was estimated using the SEER-MHOS database. Factors associated with UI were investigated using logistic regression and the impact of UI on SF-36 scores was determined using linear regression.  Results:   Over 36% of SEER-MHOS beneficiaries without cancer reported UI and higher prevalence was noted among cancer survivors (37%-54% depending on cancer type). History of bladder, breast, endometrial/uterine, or prostate cancer was associated with higher prevalence of UI. UI was independently associated with both lower physical component scores (PCS) (-1.27; 95%CI:-1.34,-1.20) and mental component scores (MCS) (-1.75; 95%CI -1.83, -1.68). A suggested decreasing trend in the prevalence of UI was associated with a longer time since cancer diagnosis.

Fortunately, the prognosis is excellent if detected at an early stage. Hence, the detection and localization of prostate cancer is crucial for diagnosis, as well as treatment via targeted focal therapy. New imaging techniques can potentially be invaluable tools for improving prostate cancer detection and localization.  Methods:   In this study, we introduce a new form of diffusion magnetic resonance imaging called correlated diffusion imaging, where the tissue being imaged is characterized by the joint correlation of diffusion signal attenuation across multiple gradient pulse strengths and timings. By taking into account signal attenuation at different water diffusion motion sensitivities, correlated diffusion imaging can provide improved delineation between cancerous tissue and healthy tissue when compared to existing diffusion imaging modalities.  Results:   Quantitative evaluation using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, tissue class separability analysis, and visual assessment by an expert radiologist were performed to study correlated diffusion imaging for the task of prostate cancer diagnosis. These results are compared with that obtained using T2-weighted imaging and standard diffusion imaging (via the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC)). Experimental results suggest that correlated diffusion imaging provide improved delineation between healthy and cancerous tissue and may have potential as a diagnostic tool for cancer detection and localization in the prostate gland.  Conclusions:   A new form of diffusion magnetic resonance imaging called correlated diffusion imaging (CDI) was developed for the purpose of aiding radiologists in cancer detection and localization in the prostate gland.

We have recently demonstrated that cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) elicit a redox-dependent epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in prostate cancer (PCa) cells, driven by cycloxygenase-2/hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1)/nuclear factor-κB pathway and enhancing tumor aggressiveness. Here, we investigated the involvement of microRNAs (miRNAs) in tumor-stroma interplay to identify possible tools to counteract oxidative stress and metastasis dissemination.  Results:   We found that miR-205 is the most downmodulated miRNA in PCa cells upon CAF stimulation, due to direct transcriptional repression by HIF-1, a known redox-sensitive transcription factor. Rescue experiments demonstrated that ectopic miR-205 overexpression in PCa cells counteracts CAF-induced EMT, thus impairing enhancement of cell invasion, acquisition of stem cell traits, tumorigenicity, and metastatic dissemination. In addition, miR-205 blocks tumor-driven activation of surrounding fibroblasts by reducing pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion.  Innovation:   Overall, such findings suggest miR-205 as a brake against PCa metastasis by blocking both the afferent and efferent arms of the circuit between tumor cells and associated fibroblasts, thus interrupting the pro-oxidant and pro-inflammatory circuitries engaged by reactive stroma.

Material and methods:   Tissue sections from 110 resected prostatic lesions distributed as 80 cases of prostatic adenocarcinoma and 30 cases of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) were evaluated for Snail and Maspin proteins expression by immunohistochemistry.  Results:   Snail protein expression was detected in 53.8% of prostatic adenocarcinomas versus none of BPH cases (p = < 0.001). A significant positive correlation of Snail expression to cancer grade (p = 0.015), lymph node metastasis (p = 0.026) and pTNM stage (p = 0.036).

Methods:   Tissue sections from 39 prostatectomies were Feulgen-stained and digitally scanned (400×), providing maps of DNA content per pixel. PCa and benign epithelial nuclei were randomly selected for measurement of 52 basic morphometric features. Logistic regression models discriminating benign from PCa nuclei, and benign from malignant nuclear populations, were built and cross-validated by AUC analysis. Nuclear populations were randomly collected <1 mm or >5 mm from cancer foci, and from cancer-free prostates, HGPIN, and PCa Gleason grade 3-5. Nuclei also were collected from negative biopsy subjects who had a subsequent diagnosis of PCa and age-matched cancer-free controls (20 pairs).  Results:   A multi-feature nuclear score discriminated cancer from benign cell populations with AUCs of 0.91 and 0.79, respectively, in training and validation sets of patients.

In negative biopsies, a validated model with 5 variance features yielded significantly higher scores in cases than controls (P = 0.026).  Conclusions:   A multifeature nuclear morphometric score, obtained by automated digital analysis, was validated for discrimination of benign from cancer nuclei. This score demonstrated field effects in benign epithelial nuclei at varying distance from PCa lesions, and was associated with subsequent PCa detection in negative biopsies.  Impact:   This nuclear score shows promise as a risk predictor among men with negative biopsies and as an intermediate biomarker in Phase II chemoprevention trials. The results also suggest that subvisual disturbances in nuclear structure precede the development of pre-neoplastic lesions.""","""['Peter H Gann', 'Ryan Deaton', 'Anup Amatya', 'Mahesh Mohnani', 'Erika Enk Rueter', 'Yirong Yang', 'Viju Ananthanarayanan']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['DNA Ploidy as surrogate for biopsy gleason score for preoperative organ versus nonorgan-confined prostate cancer prediction.', 'Nuclear Shape and Architecture in Benign Fields Predict Biochemical Recurrence in Prostate Cancer Patients Following Radical Prostatectomy: Preliminary Findings.', 'Atypical cribriform lesions of the prostate: relationship to prostatic carcinoma and implication for diagnosis in prostate biopsies.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Atypical small acinar proliferation (ASAP): Is a repeat biopsy necessary ASAP?

However, CaP eventually progresses to grow in a castration-resistant state due to aberrant activation of androgen receptor (AR). Understanding the mechanisms leading to the aberrant activation of AR is critical to develop effective therapy. We have previously identified Rho GDP Dissociation Inhibitor alpha (GDIα) as a novel suppressor in prostate cancer. In this study, we examine the effect of GDIα on AR signaling in prostate cancer cells.  Methods:   GDIα was transiently or stably transfected into several prostate cancer cell lines including LNCaP, C4-2, CWR22Rv1, and DU145. The regulation of AR expression by GDIα was analyzed by qRT-PCR and Western blot. AR activity was measured by luciferase reporter assays and electrophoretic mobility shift analysis (EMSA). Immunofluorescence assay was performed to study AR nuclear translocation. The interaction between GDIα and AR was examined by co-immunoprecipitation assays.  Results:   In this study, we have identified GDIα as a negative regulator of AR signaling pathway. Overexpression of GDIα downregulates AR expression at both mRNA and protein levels. Overexpression of GDIα is able to prevent AR nuclear translocation and inhibit transactivation of AR target genes. Co-immunoprecipitation assays showed that GDIα physically interacts with the N-terminal domain of AR.  Conclusions:   GDIα suppresses AR signaling through inhibition of AR expression, nuclear translocation, and recruitment to androgen-responsive genes. GDIα regulatory pathway may play a critical role in regulating AR signaling and prostate cancer growth and progression.""","""['Yezi Zhu', 'Chengfei Liu', 'Ramakumar Tummala', 'Nagalakshmi Nadiminty', 'Wei Lou', 'Allen C Gao']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['RhoGDIα suppresses growth and survival of prostate cancer cells.', 'Androgen receptor promotes tamoxifen agonist activity by activation of EGFR in ERα-positive breast cancer.', 'Hedgehog/Gli supports androgen signaling in androgen deprived and androgen independent prostate cancer cells.', 'Targeting androgen receptor action for prostate cancer treatment: does the post-receptor level provide novel opportunities?', 'Maintaining and reprogramming genomic androgen receptor activity in prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptor-modulatory microRNAs provide insight into therapy resistance and therapeutic targets in advanced prostate cancer.', 'RhoGDIα suppresses self-renewal and tumorigenesis of glioma stem cells.', 'RAB8A a new biomarker for endometrial cancer?']"""

When the expression of GRP78 was silenced using a GRP78-specific small interfering RNA in PC-3 cells, the growth rate and adhesive ability were reduced. Cell migration was dramatically decreased in GRP78-depleted cells. Dissection of the involved signal pathways revealed that maspin expression was upregulated after silencing GRP78 expression.

It is downregulated in most forms of cancers and inhibits malignant growth by repressing genes involved in processes such as proliferation, anti-apoptosis, stemness, and migration. We have previously reported downregulation and tumour suppressive properties for miR-34c in prostate cancer (PCa).  Methods:   In this study, we set out to further characterize the mechanisms by which miR-34c deregulation contributes to PCa progression. The genes regulated by miR-34c in the PCa cell line PC3 were identified by microarray analyses and were found to be enriched in cell death, cell cycle, cellular growth, and cellular movement pathways. One of the identified targets was MET, a receptor tyrosine kinase activated by hepatocyte growth factor, that is crucial for metastatic progression.  Results:   We confirmed the inhibitory effect of miR-34c on both MET transcript and protein levels. The binding of miR-34c to two binding sites in the 3'-UTR of MET was validated using luciferase reporter assays and target site blockers. The effect of this regulation on the miR-34c inhibition of the migratory phenotype was also confirmed. In addition, a significant inverse correlation between miR-34c expression levels and MET immunostaining was found in PCa patients.

However, its effect on apoptosis in prostate cancer cells has not been addressed. Thus, we examined the effects of isoalantolactone on prostate cancer cells. It was found that isoalantolactone inhibits growth of both androgen-sensitive (LNCaP) as well as androgen-independent (PC3 and DU-145) prostate cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, our results indicate that isoalantolactone-induced apoptosis in prostate cancer PC3 cells is associated with the generation of ROS and dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm). In addition, isoalantolactone triggers apoptosis in prostate cancer cells via up-regulation of Bax, down-regulation of Bcl-2, survivin, and significant activation of caspase-3. Isoalantolactone-induced apoptosis is markedly abrogated when the cells were pretreated with N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a specific ROS inhibitor, suggesting that the apoptosis-inducing effect of isoalantolactone in prostate cancer cells is mediated by reactive oxygen species.

We aimed to assess the use of serum angiogenin as a prostate cancer diagnostic tool among candidates for biopsy. We selected 252 patients referred for ultrasound-guided transrectal prostate biopsy on the basis of an abnormal digital rectal examination and/or elevated total PSA. Serum angiogenin was quantitatively analyzed by solid-phase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results of the prostatic pathology assessment (cancer vs. noncancer) were defined by biopsy. The median serum angiogenin levels were significantly higher in patients with prostate cancer (median: 487,500 vs. 414,800 pg/ml, P=0.008). Among patients with baseline tPSA of 4.0 ng/ml or less, 37.5% had serum angiogenin less than 389,000 pg/ml (sensitivity: 88.9%; specificity: 45.2%), and the probability of having prostate cancer varied from 22.5% before testing to 6.7% among those with low angiogenin levels. When further restricting the analyses to a group of patients with even lower probability of having cancer, on the basis of tPSA and f/t PSA values, the evaluation of serum angiogenin did not contribute toward a meaningful variation in the post-test probability of cancer. In conclusion, serum angiogenin levels may be useful to distinguish between cancer and noncancer patients among the candidates for prostatic biopsy in regular clinical practice.

Epigenetic alterations are reversible, and much research has been focused on understanding these alterations with the aim of developing effective therapies. Prostate-derived Ets factor (PDEF) is a member of the Ets family of transcription factors and has long been under investigation for its key role in tumor development and progression. To date, no studies have been conducted to elucidate the epigenetic modifications of PDEF in cancer progression. Using breast and prostate cancer cells, we investigated the effect of the methylation inhibitor 5' azacytidine (AZA) on the expression of PDEF in these cells. The inhibition of methylation observed was specific to breast cancer cells as experiments with prostate cells did not exhibit any significant change. Notably, the expression of p21, a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor 1 and also a target gene of PDEF, was found to be positively correlated with PDEF expression following 5'AZA treatment. Inhibition of methylation led to a decrease in the proliferation rate of MDA-MB-468 cells as revealed by MTT proliferation assay. Other epigenetic alterations such as histone modifications were not observed in these breast cancer cells following treatment with specific HDAC inhibitors. Our data suggest the possibility of epigenetic modification of PDEF due to DNA methylation and involvement of the cell cycle inhibitor p21.

Materials and methods:   A multi-institutional search identified 63 patients with incidental TURP-diagnosed prostate cancer from 2001 to 2010, who underwent subsequent TRUSBx or radical prostatectomy (RP). The Gleason scores from TURP were compared to those from TRUSBx or RP. Whole mount maps from RP were analysed to provide an anatomical basis for the correlation observed. To determine the clinical impact of this problem, the incidence of TURP-diagnosed prostate cancer in the population was also determined.  Results:   Of 22 patients who underwent TRUSBx, the rates of Gleason score concordance, upgrading and downgrading were 32, 14 and 54% respectively (Spearman correlation coefficient 0.20). Most cases of pathological downgrading consisted of benign cores at biopsy. Therefore, TRUSBx did not give additional Gleason score (GS) information in 86% of patients. Of 41 RP patients, the respective rates were 61, 22 and 17% (Spearman correlation coefficient 0.15). The majority of them retained a similar or lower GS between TURP and RP. Of 13 whole mount maps analysed, 6 (46%) were found with anterior/transitional zone (AZ/TZ) tumours, 6 (46%) with multifocal tumours and 1 (8%) with a large peripheral zone (PZ) tumour extending into the TZ. Regional population data show that despite a gradual reduction in the proportion of TURP-diagnosed cases over the past decade, they still account for 8.5-13% of all new cases.

Consequently, inhibition of the CXCR7/CXCR4/SDF-1α axis may assist in controlling prostate tumor growth and progression. To facilitate the development of potential therapeutics, further clarification of CXCR7 function is required, specifically in relation to CXCR4. In this study, we report that CXCR7 and CXCR4 were co-expressed in LNCaP, DU145 and PC3 cell lines in 2D culture. When cultured in 3D using Matrigel, a marked up-regulation of both receptors was observed in PC3 cells. Interestingly, both CXCR7 and CXCR4 co-localized within radiating cellular structures, termed stellate projections, which protruded outward into the matrix. The stellate projections were rich in the expression of pro-invasive integrin β1, β-laminin and MMP-11 proteins. The development of the stellate projections was mediated by integrin β1-mediated interactions with the ECM, which also regulated the expression of CXCR7 and CXCR4. Taken together, these results demonstrate that integrin-mediated cell-ECM interactions can modulate tumor cell morphology, and regulate the expression of chemokine receptors which are associated with the invasive phenotype and progression of PCa.""","""['Debra L Kiss', 'Louisa C E Windus', 'Vicky M Avery']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Cytokine""","""['Androgen receptor and chemokine receptors 4 and 7 form a signaling axis to regulate CXCL12-dependent cellular motility.', 'The disparate twins: a comparative study of CXCR4 and CXCR7 in SDF-1α-induced gene expression, invasion and chemosensitivity of colon cancer.', 'Expression and function of CXCL12/CXCR4/CXCR7 in thyroid cancer.', 'CXCL12-CXCR4/CXCR7 Axis in Colorectal Cancer: Therapeutic Target in Preclinical and Clinical Studies.', 'Biological/pathological functions of the CXCL12/CXCR4/CXCR7 axes in the pathogenesis of bladder cancer.', 'Applications and Advances of Multicellular Tumor Spheroids: Challenges in Their Development and Analysis.', 'Implications of Three-Dimensional Cell Culture in Cancer Therapeutic Research.', 'Three-dimensional models: a novel approach for lymphoma research.', 'Promotion of gastric tumor initiating cells in a 3D collagen gel culture model via YBX1/SPP1/NF-κB signaling.', 'Halfway between 2D and Animal Models: Are 3D Cultures the Ideal Tool to Study Cancer-Microenvironment Interactions?']"""

In turn, this results in enhanced tumor cell invasion in low nutrients and metastatic dissemination to bone or liver in disease models in mice. Moreover, we found that phosphorylated ULK1 levels were correlated with shortened overall survival in patients with non-small cell lung cancer.

We systematically evaluated 15 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within NF-κB binding sites those were predicted using a genome-wide database in a cohort of 1024 prostate cancer patients.

We found that PSMD7 rs2387084 and MYCN rs1429409 were significantly related to earlier onset of prostate cancer and advanced clinical stage, respectively. No SNPs were significantly associated with disease recurrence after RP. Four and three SNPs were notably associated with prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM) and all-cause mortality (ACM), respectively, after ADT.

We aim to identify the causes of death and factors predictive for mortality in this population.  Methods and materials:   A total of 660 patients with high-risk prostate cancer were treated with definitive high-dose external beam radiation therapy (≥ 74 Gy) and androgen deprivation (AD) between 1996 and 2009 at a single institution. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was conducted to determine factors predictive of survival.  Results:   The median radiation dose was 78 Gy, median duration of AD was 6 months, and median follow-up was 74 months. The 10-year overall survival (OS) was 60.6%. Prostate cancer was the leading single cause of death, with 10-year mortality of 14.1% (95% CI 10.7-17.6), compared with other cancers (8.4%, 95% CI 5.7-11.1), cardiovascular disease (7.3%, 95% CI 4.7-9.9), and all other causes (10.4%, 95% CI 7.2-13.6). On multivariate analysis, older age (HR 1.55, P=.002) and Charlson comorbidity index score (CS) ≥ 1 (HR 2.20, P<.0001) were significant factors predictive of OS, whereas Gleason score, T stage, prostate-specific antigen, duration of AD, radiation dose, smoking history, and body mass index were not. Men younger than 70 years of age with CS = 0 were more likely to die of prostate cancer than any other cause, whereas older men or those with CS ≥ 1 more commonly suffered non-prostate cancer death. The cumulative incidences of prostate cancer-specific mortality were similar regardless of age or comorbidities (P=.60).  Conclusions:   Men with high-risk prostate cancer are more likely to die of causes other than prostate cancer, except for the subgroup of men younger than 70 years of age without comorbidities.

To identify drugs capable of targeting treatment-resistant cancer cells, we screened small-molecule kinase inhibitor libraries for compounds that decrease the viability of apoptosis-resistant human MCF7-Bcl-2 breast cancer cells. SU11652, a multitargeting receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, emerged as the most potent compound in the screen. In addition to MCF7-Bcl-2 cells, it effectively killed HeLa cervix carcinoma, U-2-OS osteosarcoma, Du145 prostate carcinoma, and WEHI-S fibrosarcoma cells at low micromolar concentration. SU11652 accumulated rapidly in lysosomes and disturbed their pH regulation and ultrastructure, eventually leading to the leakage of lysosomal proteases into the cytosol. Lysosomal destabilization was preceded by an early inhibition of acid sphingomyelinase, a lysosomal lipase that promotes lysosomal membrane stability. Accordingly, Hsp70, which supports cancer cell survival by increasing lysosomal acid sphingomyelinase activity, conferred partial protection against SU11652-induced cytotoxicity. Remarkably, SU11652 killed multidrug-resistant Du145 prostate cancer cells as effectively as the drug-sensitive parental cells, and subtoxic concentrations of SU11652 effectively inhibited multidrug-resistant phenotype in Du145 prostate cancer cells. Notably, sunitinib, a structurally almost identical and widely used antiangiogenic cancer drug, exhibited similar lysosome-dependent cytotoxic activity, albeit with significantly lower efficacy. The significantly stronger lysosome-targeting activity of SU11652 suggests that it may display better efficacy in cancer treatment than sunitinib, encouraging further evaluation of its anticancer activity in vivo.

Current evidence suggests that CRPC cells can produce their own androgens from endogenous sterol precursors that act in an intracrine manner to stimulate tumor growth. The mechanisms by which CRPC cells become steroidogenic during tumor progression are not well defined. Herein we describe a novel link between the elevated cholesterol phenotype of CRPC and the TERE1 tumor suppressor protein, a prenyltransferase that synthesizes vitamin K-2, which is a potent endogenous ligand for the SXR nuclear hormone receptor. We show that 50% of primary and metastatic prostate cancer specimens exhibit a loss of TERE1 expression and we establish a correlation between TERE1 expression and cholesterol in the LnCaP-C81 steroidogenic cell model of the CRPC. LnCaP-C81 cells also lack TERE1 protein, and show elevated cholesterol synthetic rates, higher steady state levels of cholesterol, and increased expression of enzymes in the de novo cholesterol biosynthetic pathways than the non-steroidogenic prostate cancer cells. C81 cells also show decreased expression of the SXR nuclear hormone receptor and a panel of directly regulated SXR target genes that govern cholesterol efflux and steroid catabolism. Thus, a combination of increased synthesis, along with decreased efflux and catabolism likely underlies the CRPC phenotype: SXR might coordinately regulate this phenotype. Moreover, TERE1 controls synthesis of vitamin K-2, which is a potent endogenous ligand for SXR activation, strongly suggesting a link between TERE1 levels, K-2 synthesis and SXR target gene regulation. We demonstrate that following ectopic TERE1 expression or induction of endogenous TERE1, the elevated cholesterol levels in C81 cells are reduced. Moreover, reconstitution of TERE1 expression in C81 cells reactivates SXR and switches on a suite of SXR target genes that coordinately promote both cholesterol efflux and androgen catabolism.

We propose that TERE1 controls the CPRC phenotype by regulating the endogenous levels of Vitamin K-2 and hence the transcriptional control of a suite of steroidogenic genes via the SXR receptor.

Methods:   Baseline data collected as part of a randomized controlled trial evaluating a nurse-led supportive care intervention for men with prostate cancer commencing radiotherapy at a specialist cancer hospital in Melbourne, Australia. Measures assessed global distress (DT), anxious and depressive symptomatology (HADS), prostate-cancer specific quality of life (EPIC-26), unmet supportive care needs (SCNS-SF34R) and cancer treatment-related concerns (CATS). Following descriptive and correlational analysis, hierarchical multiple regression was employed to examine the contribution of variable sets to explaining variance in DT scores.  Results:   Less than 20% of men reported DT scores of 4 or higher, indicating overall low distress. The DT accurately identified almost all men reporting HADS score indicative of anxious or depressive symptomatology, suggesting it accurately identifies psychological morbidity. Importantly, the DT identified a further group of distressed men, not identified by HADS, whose distress related to unmet needs and prostate cancer-specific issues, indicating the DT is superior in identifying other forms of distress. While the hierarchical multiple regression confirmed anxious and depressive symptomatology as the best predictor of distress score, many other scales are also good predictors of DT scores, supporting the argument that distress is multi-determined.  Significance of results:   Nurses can be confident that the DT accurately identifies patients with psychological morbidity and importantly identifies other patients with distress who may require intervention. A distress score of 4 or higher identified participants with higher physical symptomatology, higher unmet needs, more concerns about treatment and poorer quality of life. The low prevalence of distress reaching cut off scores suggests nurses would not be overwhelmed by the outcomes of screening and could use the score to prioritise the patients who need greater attention at entry to radiotherapy services.""","""['Kerryann Lotfi-Jam', 'Karla Gough', 'Penelope Schofield', 'Sanchia Aranda']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Palliat Support Care""","""['What to do with screening for distress scores?

However, rising life expectancy has increased the number of PWH suffering from other malignancies. This study aimed to collect cancer occurrence data in PWH followed in five European haemophilia treatment centres (Brussels, Geneva, Marseille, Montpellier and Paris-Bicêtre) over the last 10 years and to analyse some particular features of cancer occurring in PWH. In total, 45 malignancies were diagnosed in 1067 PWH. The most common malignancies were hepatocellular carcinoma (12/45) and urogenital tract tumours (9/45). Bleeding at presentation or changes in bleeding pattern was indicative of cancer in four patients. Three patients with mild haemophilia developed anti-factor VIII inhibitors after intensive substitution therapy prior to surgery or invasive procedures. There was no bleeding associated with chemotherapy or radiotherapy. A few bleeding complications occurred following invasive (3/39) or surgical procedures (2/27) as a result of insufficient hemostatic coverage or in spite of adequate substitution. No bleeding was noted after liver or prostate biopsies. Following cancer diagnosis, five patients were switched from on-demand to prolonged prophylaxis substitution. In the majority of cases, the standard cancer treatment protocol was not modified on account of concomitant haemophilia. Thus, oncological treatments are not contraindicated and should not be withheld in PWH assuming that adequate haemostasis correction is undertaken. As shown by our study results, a change in bleeding pattern in adult PWH should raise suspicion of a malignancy.

Background:   With early detection and improved treatments, prostate cancer survivors are living longer with the disease and the side-effects of treatment. How they cope affects their long-term physical and mental health.  Design:   A prospective, longitudinal, exploratory design using both qualitative and quantitative methods was used in this study.  Method:   Between September 2006-September 2007 149 men who were about to undergo radical radiotherapy ± androgen deprivation for localized prostate cancer in Northern Ireland were recruited to the study. They completed the Brief Cope scale at four time-points.  Results:   Acceptance, positive reframing, emotional support, planning and, just getting on with it, were the most common ways of coping. Fewer men used coping strategies less at 6 months and 1 year after radiotherapy in comparison to pre-treatment and 4-6 weeks after radiotherapy. Interviews with these men demonstrated that men adapted to a new norm, with the support of their wives/partners and did not readily seek professional help. A minority of men used alcohol, behavioural disengagement and self blame as ways of coping.  Conclusion:   Men used a variety of ways of coping to help them deal with radiotherapy and neo-adjuvant androgen deprivation for up to 12 months after radiotherapy.

Thus, this mutation abrogates the ability of PAK1 to induce changes in cell morphology and motility and to promote malignant transformation of prostate epithelial cells.

Studies were performed to determine the effects of a model statin, atorvastatin (ATO), on the proliferation and differentiation of prostate cancer cells, and to identify possible mechanisms of ATO action. ATO inhibited the in vitro proliferation of both LNCaP and PC3 human prostate cancer cells in a dose- and time-dependent fashion. The greater inhibitory activity of ATO in PC3 cells was associated with induction of autophagy in that cell line, as demonstrated by increased expression of LC3-II. miR-182 was consistently upregulated by ATO in PC3 cells, but not in LNCaP cells. ATO upregulation of miR-182 in PC3 cells was p53-independent and was reversed by geranylgeraniol. Transfection of miR-182 inhibitors decreased expression of miR-182 by >98% and attenuated the antiproliferative activity of ATO. miR-182 expression in PC3 cells was also increased in response to stress induced by serum withdrawal, suggesting that miR-182 upregulation can occur due to nutritional stress. Bcl2 and p21 were identified to be potential target genes of miR-182 in PC3 cells. Bcl2 was downregulated and p21 was upregulated in PC3 cells exposed to ATO.

It has been shown that genistein inhibits many type of cancers including prostate cancer (PCa) by regulating several cell signaling pathways and microRNAs (miRNAs). Recent studies suggest that the long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are also involved in many cellular processes. At present there are no reports about the relationship between gensitein, miRNAs and lncRNAs. In this study, we focused on miRNAs, lncRNA that are regulated by genistein and investigated their functional role in PCa.  Method:   Microarray (SurePrint G3 Human GE 8×60K) was used for expression profiling of genistein treated and control PCa cells (PC3 and DU145). Functional assay (cell proliferation, migration, invasion, apoptosis and cell cycle assays) were performed with the PCa cell lines, PC3 and DU145. Both in vitro and in vivo (nude mouse) models were used for growth assays. Luciferase reporter assays were used for binding of miR-34a to HOTAIR.  Results:   LncRNA profiling showed that HOTAIR was highly regulated by genistein and its expression was higher in castration-resistant PCa cell lines than in normal prostate cells. Knockdown (siRNA) of HOTAIR decreased PCa cell proliferation, migration and invasion and induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. miR-34a was also up-regulated by genistein and may directly target HOTAIR in both PC3 and DU145 PCa cells.  Conclusions:   Our results indicated that genistein inhibited PCa cell growth through down-regulation of oncogenic HOTAIR that is also targeted by tumor suppressor miR-34a.

The SNP genotyping was made in a Biotrove OpenArray® NT Cycler.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Comparisons of genotypic and allelic frequencies among populations, as well as haplotype analyses were determined using the web-based environment SNPator. Principal component analysis was made using the SnpMatrix and XSnpMatrix classes and methods implemented as an R package.

Results and limitations:   We observed that genotype distribution of 4 out 10 SNPs was statistically different among the studied populations, showing the greatest differences between Andalusia and Catalonia. These observations were confirmed in cluster analysis, principal component analysis and in the differential distribution of haplotypes among the populations. Because tumor characteristics have not been taken into account, it is possible that some polymorphisms may influence tumor characteristics in the same way that it may pose a risk factor for other disease characteristics.

Using the conditional PTEN deletion mouse model, we previously reported that survivin levels increase with prostate tumor growth. Here we evaluated the functional role of survivin in prostate tumor growth. First, we demonstrated that mice lacking the survivin gene in prostate epithelium were fertile and had normal prostate growth and development. We then serially, from about 10-56 weeks of age, evaluated histopathologic changes in the prostate of mice with PTEN deletion combined with survivin mono- or bi-allelic gene deletion. While within this time period most of the animals with wild-type or monoallelic survivin deletion developed adenocarcinomas, the most severe lesions in the biallelic survivin deleted mice were high-grade prostatic intra-epithelial neoplasia with distinct histopathology. Many atypical cells contained large hypertrophic cytoplasm and desmoplastic reaction in the prostatic intra-epithelial neoplasia lesions of this group was minimal until the late ages.

Here we used miRNA profiling to identify cancer-associated miRNAs that are differentially expressed in sera from patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) as compared to healthy controls. Of 365 miRNAs profiled, we identified five serum miRNAs (miR-141, miR-200a, miR-200c, miR-210 and miR-375) that were elevated in cases compared to controls across two independent cohorts. One of these, miR-210, is a known transcriptional target of the hypoxia-responsive HIF-1α signaling pathway. Exposure of cultured prostate cancer cells to hypoxia led to induction of miR-210 and its release into the extracellular environment. Moreover, we found that serum miR-210 levels varied widely amongst mCRPC patients undergoing therapy, and correlated with treatment response as assessed by change in PSA.

While several models predict absolute risk of breast cancer, there are few models for ovarian cancer in the general population, and none for endometrial cancer.  Methods and findings:   Using data on white, non-Hispanic women aged 50+ y from two large population-based cohorts (the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial [PLCO] and the National Institutes of Health-AARP Diet and Health Study [NIH-AARP]), we estimated relative and attributable risks and combined them with age-specific US-population incidence and competing mortality rates. All models included parity. The breast cancer model additionally included estrogen and progestin menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) use, other MHT use, age at first live birth, menopausal status, age at menopause, family history of breast or ovarian cancer, benign breast disease/biopsies, alcohol consumption, and body mass index (BMI); the endometrial model included menopausal status, age at menopause, BMI, smoking, oral contraceptive use, MHT use, and an interaction term between BMI and MHT use; the ovarian model included oral contraceptive use, MHT use, and family history or breast or ovarian cancer. In independent validation data (Nurses' Health Study cohort) the breast and ovarian cancer models were well calibrated; expected to observed cancer ratios were 1.00 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.96-1.04) for breast cancer and 1.08 (95% CI: 0.97-1.19) for ovarian cancer. The number of endometrial cancers was significantly overestimated, expected/observed = 1.20 (95% CI: 1.11-1.29). The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs; discriminatory power) were 0.58 (95% CI: 0.57-0.59), 0.59 (95% CI: 0.56-0.63), and 0.68 (95% CI: 0.66-0.70) for the breast, ovarian, and endometrial models, respectively.  Conclusions:   These models predict absolute risks for breast, endometrial, and ovarian cancers from easily obtainable risk factors and may assist in clinical decision-making. Limitations are the modest discriminatory ability of the breast and ovarian models and that these models may not generalize to women of other races.

Several of these variants demonstrate associations with multiple cancers, suggesting pleiotropic effects and shared biological mechanisms across some cancers. We hypothesised that SNPs previously associated with other cancers may additionally be associated with colorectal cancer. In a large-scale study, we examined 171 SNPs previously associated with 18 different cancers for their associations with colorectal cancer.  Design:   We examined 13 338 colorectal cancer cases and 40 967 controls from three consortia: Population Architecture using Genomics and Epidemiology (PAGE), Genetic Epidemiology of Colorectal Cancer (GECCO), and the Colon Cancer Family Registry (CCFR).

Greater screening rates coupled with improved detection methods have caused a controversial upsurge in the number of men undergoing prostate biopsy and subsequent treatment. However, current diagnostic techniques generally suffer from limited ability to identify which seemingly indolent cancers are biologically aggressive.  Methods:   We collected prostatic fluid from 778 post-radical prostatectomy specimens and randomly selected samples from both the clinically confirmed aggressive (n = 50) and non-aggressive (n = 50) prostate cancer populations. We measured the level of proteolytic enzyme activity of PSA (aPSA) in each sample and used receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to correlate aPSA levels with prostate cancer aggressiveness.  Results:   We found aPSA in prostatic fluid to be inversely proportional to disease stage, such that patients with the most aggressive PCa have on average significantly reduced aPSA compared to those with less aggressive disease. Significantly, our results suggest that many (22% in our study population) of the diagnosed patients with non-aggressive PCa could have averted or delayed radical prostatectomy.

Genetic polymorphism in Apolipoprotein (Apo) E, a key cholesterol regulatory protein may effect changes in systemic cholesterol levels. In this investigation, we determined whether variants of the Apo E gene can trigger defective intracellular cholesterol efflux, which could promote aggressive prostate cancer. ApoE genotypes of weakly (non-aggressive), moderate and highly tumorigenic (aggressive) prostate cancer cell lines were characterized, and we explored whether the ApoE variants were associated with tumor aggressiveness generated by intra-cellular cholesterol imbalance, using the expression of caveolin-1 (cav-1), a pro-malignancy surrogate of cholesterol overload. Restriction isotyping of ApoE isoforms revealed that the non-aggressive cell lines carried ApoE ε3/ε3 or ε3/ε4 alleles, while the aggressive cell lines carried the Apoε2/ε4 alleles. Our data suggest a contrast between the non-aggressive and the aggressive prostate cancer cell lines in the pattern of cholesterol efflux and cav-1 expression.

NF2 is characterized by formation of multiple schwannomas, meningiomas and ependymomas. Merlin loss-of-function is associated with increased activity of Rac and p21-activated kinases (PAKs) and deregulation of cytoskeletal organization. LIM domain kinases (LIMK1 and 2) are substrate for Cdc42/Rac-PAK and modulate actin dynamics by phosphorylating cofilin at serine-3. This modification inactivates the actin severing and depolymerizing activity of cofilin. LIMKs also translocate into the nucleus and regulate cell cycle progression. Significantly, LIMKs are overexpressed in several tumor types, including skin, breast, lung, liver and prostate. Here we report that mouse Schwann cells (MSCs) in which merlin function is lost as a result of Nf2 exon2 deletion (Nf2(ΔEx2)) exhibited increased levels of LIMK1, LIMK2 and active phospho-Thr508/505-LIMK1/2, as well as phospho-Ser3-cofilin, compared with wild-type normal MSCs. Similarly, levels of LIMK1 and 2 total protein and active phosphorylated forms were elevated in human vestibular schwannomas compared with normal human Schwann cells (SCs). Reintroduction of wild-type NF2 into Nf2(ΔEx2) MSC reduced LIMK1 and LIMK2 levels. We show that pharmacological inhibition of LIMK with BMS-5 decreased the viability of Nf2(ΔEx2) MSCs in a dose-dependent manner, but did not affect viability of control MSCs. Similarly, LIMK knockdown decreased viability of Nf2(ΔEx2) MSCs.

As mature caveolin-1 resides in caveolae, invaginated lipid raft domains at the plasma membrane, caveolae have been suggested as a tumor-promoting signaling platform in prostate cancer. However, caveola formation requires both caveolin-1 and cavin-1 (also known as PTRF; polymerase I and transcript release factor). Here, we examined the expression of cavin-1 in prostate epithelia and stroma using tissue microarray including normal, non-malignant and malignant prostate tissues. We found that caveolin-1 was induced without the presence of cavin-1 in advanced prostate carcinoma, an expression pattern mirrored in the PC-3 cell line. In contrast, normal prostate epithelia expressed neither caveolin-1 nor cavin-1, while prostate stroma highly expressed both caveolin-1 and cavin-1. Utilizing PC-3 cells as a suitable model for caveolin-1-positive advanced prostate cancer, we found that cavin-1 expression in PC-3 cells inhibits anchorage-independent growth, and reduces in vivo tumor growth and metastasis in an orthotopic prostate cancer xenograft mouse model. The expression of α-smooth muscle actin in stroma along with interleukin-6 (IL-6) in cancer cells was also decreased in tumors of mice bearing PC-3-cavin-1 tumor cells. To determine whether cavin-1 acts by neutralizing caveolin-1, we expressed cavin-1 in caveolin-1-negative prostate cancer LNCaP and 22Rv1 cells. Caveolin-1 but not cavin-1 expression increased anchorage-independent growth in LNCaP and 22Rv1 cells. Cavin-1 co-expression reversed caveolin-1 effects in caveolin-1-positive LNCaP cells. Taken together, these results suggest that caveolin-1 in advanced prostate cancer is present outside of caveolae, because of the lack of cavin-1 expression. Cavin-1 expression attenuates the effects of non-caveolar caveolin-1 microdomains partly via reduced IL-6 microenvironmental function. With circulating caveolin-1 as a potential biomarker for advanced prostate cancer, identification of the molecular pathways affected by cavin-1 could provide novel therapeutic targets.""","""['H Moon', 'C S Lee', 'K L Inder', 'S Sharma', 'E Choi', 'D M Black', 'K-A Lê Cao', 'C Winterford', 'J I Coward', 'M T Ling;Australian Prostate Cancer BioResource;D J Craik', 'R G Parton', 'P J Russell', 'M M Hill']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['PTRF-cavin-1 expression decreases the migration of PC3 prostate cancer cells: role of matrix metalloprotease 9.', 'PTRF/Cavin-1 decreases prostate cancer angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis.', 'Expression of PTRF in PC-3 Cells modulates cholesterol dynamics and the actin cytoskeleton impacting secretion pathways.', 'Caveola-forming proteins caveolin-1 and PTRF in prostate cancer.', 'Caveola-forming proteins and prostate cancer.', 'Proteomics of High-Grade Serous Ovarian Cancer Models Identifies Cancer-Associated Fibroblast Markers Associated with Clinical Outcomes.', 'SPECHT: Self-tuning Plausibility based object detection Enables quantification of Conflict in Heterogeneous multi-scale microscopy.', 'Caveolar and non-Caveolar Caveolin-1 in ocular homeostasis and disease.', 'Deformation of caveolae impacts global transcription and translation processes through relocalization of cavin-1.', 'Caveolae-Associated Molecules, Tumor Stroma, and Cancer Drug Resistance: Current Findings and Future Perspectives.']"""

Herein, we tested whether one AE37 boost can induce long-lasting immunological memory in these patients. Twenty-three patients from the phase I study received one AE37 boost 6-month post-primary vaccinations. Local/systemic toxicities were evaluated following the booster injection. Immunological responses were monitored 1-month (long-term booster; LTB) and 3-year (long-term immunity; LTI) post-booster by delayed-type hypersensitivity, IFN-γ ELISPOT and proliferation assays. Regulatory T cell (Treg) frequencies, plasma transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and indoleamine 2,3-deoxygenase (IDO) activity levels were also determined at the same time points. The AE37 booster was safe and well tolerated. Immunological monitoring revealed vaccine-specific long-term immunity in most of the evaluated patients during both LTB and LTI, although individual levels of immunity during LTI were decreased compared with those measured 3 years earlier during LTB. This was paralleled with increased Tregs, TGF-β levels and IDO activity. One AE37 booster generated long-term immunological memory in HER-2/neu (+) prostate cancer patients, which was detectable 3 years later, albeit with a tendency to decline. Boosted patients had favorable clinical outcome in terms of overall and/or metastasis-free survival compared with historical groups with similar clinical characteristics at diagnosis.

The urologist point of view""","""About 40% of all patients undergoing radical treatment for localized prostate cancer (PCa) develop biochemical relapse (BCR) during lifetime but only 10-20% of them will show clinically detectable recurrences. Prostatic bed, pelvic or retroperitoneal lymph nodes (LN) and bones (especially the spine) are the sites where we must focus our attention in the early phase of PSA relapse. Time to PSA relapse, PSA kinetics, pathological Gleason score and pathological stage are the main factors related to the likelihood of local vs. distant relapse. Before an extensive diagnostic work-up in patients with BCR, is mandatory to understand if there is a therapeutic consequence or not for the patient. Current imaging techniques have some potential but many limits are yet encountered in the diagnosis of disease relapse. Transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) and Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) have low accuracy in the detection of the recurrence. Today, Choline PET/CT may visualize the site of recurrence earlier, with better accuracy than conventional imaging, in a single step and even in the presence of low PSA level. In recent years, the new radiotracer (18)F-FACBC has been proposed as a possible alternative radiopharmaceutical to detect PCa relapse. From a clinical point of view, first clinical studies showed very promising and reproducible results with an improvement in sensitivity is about 20-25% with respect to Choline PET/CT, rendering the FACBC the possible radiotracer of the future for PCa. In conclusion, many improvements have been recently achieved in imaging techniques for PCa restaging, essentially in Nuclear Medicine and MRI, but negative results remain in many cases.

Differentially expressed pathways were further evaluated in a series of primary or early-stage vs metastatic or recurrent cancer samples from 389 ovarian, prostate, and oral cancer patients. Metastasis pathways were also evaluated for associations with survival in 9 independent clinicogenomic datasets from 1691 ovarian, breast, colon, brain, and lung cancer and leukemia patients. The inhibitory effects of 1 pathway (transforming growth factor [TGF]-WNT) on in vitro OVCA cell migration were studied.  Results:   Pelvic and extrapelvic OVCA implants demonstrated similar patterns of signaling pathway expression and identical p53 mutations. However, we identified 3 molecular pathways/cellular processes that were differentially expressed between pelvic and extrapelvic OVCA samples and between primary/early-stage and metastatic/advanced or recurrent ovarian, oral, and prostate cancers. Furthermore, their expression was associated with overall survival from ovarian cancer (P = .006), colon cancer (1 pathway at P = .005), and leukemia (P = .05). Artesunate-induced TGF-WNT pathway inhibition impaired OVCA cell migration.  Conclusion:   Advanced-stage OVCA has a unifocal origin in the pelvis.

Therefore, the actions of these hormones can be antagonized by preventing the irreversible conversion of T into DHT by inhibiting 5α-reductase (5α-R). This has been a useful therapeutic approach for the referred diseases and can be achieved by using 5α-reductase inhibitors (RIs). Steroidal RIs, finasteride and dutasteride, are used in clinic for BPH treatment and were also proposed for chemoprevention of prostate cancer. Nevertheless, due to the increase in bone and muscle loss, impotency and occurrence of high-grade prostate tumours, it is important to seek for other potent and specific molecules with lower side effects. In the present work, we designed and synthesized steroids with the 3-keto-Δ(4) moiety in the A-ring, as in the 5α-R substrate T, and with carboxamide, carboxyester or carboxylic acid functions at the C-17β position. The inhibitory 5α-R activity, in human prostate microsomes, as well as the anti-proliferative effects of the most potent compounds, in a human androgen-responsive prostate cancer cell line (LNCaP cells), were investigated. Our results showed that steroids 3, 4 and 5 are good RIs, which suggest that C-17β lipophylic amides favour 5α-R inhibition.

FKBP52 specifically enhances the signaling of steroid hormone receptors, modulates ion channels and regulates neuronal outgrowth dynamics. In turn, small-molecule ligands of FKBP52 have been suggested as potential neurotrophic or anti-prostate cancer agents. The usefulness of available ligands is however limited by a lack of selectivity. The immunophilin FKBP52 is composed of three domains, an FK506-binding domain with peptidyl-prolyl isomerase activity, an FKBP-like domain of unknown function and a TPR-clamp domain, which recognizes the C-terminal peptide of Hsp90 with high affinity. The herein reported crystal structures of FKBP52 reveal that the short linker connecting the FK506-binding domain and the FKBP-like domain acts as a flexible hinge. This enhanced flexibility and its modulation by phosphorylation might explain some of the functional antagonism between the closely related homologs FKBP51 and FKBP52. We further present two co-crystal structures of FKBP52 in complex with the prototypic ligand FK506 and a synthetic analog thereof. These structures revealed the molecular interactions in great detail, which enabled in-depth comparison with the corresponding complexes of the other cytosolic FKBPs, FKBP51 and FKBP12.

Recent studies suggest that the expression levels of miRNAs that act as tumor suppressors are frequently reduced in cancers because of chromosome deletions, epigenetical changes, aberrant transcription, and disturbances in miRNA processing. MiR-143 and -145 are well-recognized miRNAs that are highly expressed in several tissues, but down-regulated in most types of cancers. However, the mechanism of this down-regulation has not been investigated in detail. Here, we show that DEAD-box RNA helicase 6, DDX6 (p54/RCK), post-transcriptionally down-regulated miR-143/145 expression by prompting the degradation of its host gene product, NCR143/145 RNA. In human gastric cancer cell line MKN45, DDX6 protein was abundantly expressed and accumulated in processing bodies (P-bodies). DDX6 preferentially increased the instability of non-coding RNA, NCR143/145, which encompasses the miR-143/145 cluster, and down-regulated the expression of mature miR-143/145. In human monocytic cell line THP-1, lipopolysaccharide treatment promoted the assembly of P-bodies and down-regulated the expression of NCR143/145 and its miR-143/145 rapidly. In these cells, cycloheximide treatment led to a loss of P-bodies and to an increase in NCR143/145 RNA stability, thus resulting in up-regulation of miR-143/145 expression. These data demonstrate that DDX6 contributed to the control of NCR143/145 RNA stability in P-bodies and post-transcriptionally regulated miR-143/145 expression in cancer cells.""","""['Akio Iio', 'Takeshi Takagi', 'Kohei Miki', 'Tomoki Naoe', 'Atsuo Nakayama', 'Yukihiro Akao']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Biochim Biophys Acta""","""['Regulation of the MIR155 host gene in physiological and pathological processes.', 'DEAD-Box Protein RNA-Helicase DDX6 Regulates the Expression of HER2 and FGFR2 at the Post-Transcriptional Step in Gastric Cancer Cells.', 'Translation repression in human cells by microRNA-induced gene silencing requires RCK/p54.', 'Oncogene RNA helicase DDX6 promotes the process of c-Myc expression in gastric cancer cells.', 'DDX6 and its orthologs as modulators of cellular and viral RNA expression.', 'Characterization of 7-Methylguanosine Identified Biochemical Recurrence and Tumor Immune Microenvironment in Prostate Cancer.', 'Human Amniotic Epithelial Cells as a Tool to Investigate the Effects of Cyanidin 3-O-Glucoside on Cell Differentiation.', 'The DEAD-box protein family of RNA helicases: sentinels for a myriad of cellular functions with emerging roles in tumorigenesis.', 'Hypoxia activated long non-coding RNA HABON regulates the growth and proliferation of hepatocarcinoma cells by binding to and antagonizing HIF-1 alpha.', 'Potential role of ACE2-related microRNAs in COVID-19-associated nephropathy.']"""

Objective:   Based on the long-term results of European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) trial 30891, we questioned if differences in time to progression predict for survival differences.  Design, setting, and participants:   EORTC trial 30891 compared immediate ADT (n=492) with orchiectomy or luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analog with deferred ADT (n=493) initiated upon symptomatic disease progression or life-threatening complications in randomly assigned T0-4 N0-2 M0 PCa patients.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Time to first objective progression (documented metastases, ureteric obstruction, not PSA rise) and time to objective castration-resistant progressive disease were compared as well as PCa mortality and overall survival.  Results and limitations:   After a median of 12.8 yr, 769 of the 985 patients had died (78%), 269 of PCa (27%). For patients receiving deferred ADT, the overall treatment time was 31% of that for patients on immediate ADT. Deferred ADT was significantly worse than immediate ADT for time to first objective disease progression (p<0.0001; 10-yr progression rates 42% vs 30%). However, time to objective castration-resistant disease after deferred ADT did not differ significantly (p=0.42) from that after immediate ADT. In addition, PCa mortality did not differ significantly, except in patients with aggressive PCa resulting in death within 3-5 yr after diagnosis. Deferred ADT was inferior to immediate ADT in terms of overall survival (hazard ratio: 1.21; 95% confidence interval, 1.05-1.39; p [noninferiority]=0.72, p [difference] = 0.0085).  Conclusions:   This study shows that if hormonal manipulation is used at different times during the disease course, differences in time to first disease progression cannot predict differences in disease-specific survival.

We aimed to evaluate whether core length is a significant biopsy parameter in the detection of cancer, especially in the low risk cancer category group.  Materials and methods:   We retrospectively analyzed pathology reports of 197 patients (2196 biopsy cores) undergoing initial transrectal ultrasound guided biopsy. A multivariate analysis of age, total prostate-specific antigen (PSA) concentration, prostate gland volume, total number of cores and length of biopsy cores was performed. Secondary analyses included stratification by Gleason score. Single core analysis was done to calculate a workable cut off value for core length with optimal sensitivity and specificity in carcinoma detection.  Results:   Mean age, PSA, prostate volume, and total number of cores were 66.9 years, 12.6 ng/mL, 47.2 cc and 11.1 cores, respectively. Whereas detection of cancer was significantly associated with advanced age (p < 0.01) and smaller prostate volumes (p < 0.001), PSA levels (p = 0.40) and number of cores (p = 0.20) were not significant predictive factors. Assessment of biopsy core lengths showed that cores harboring cancer (n = 307, average length 14.1 mm) were significantly longer than benign cores (n = 1889, average length = 13.2 mm) (p < 0.001). Core length analysis yielded 13 mm cores have an optimal sensitivity (42.8%) and specificity (76.5%) for detection of carcinoma (odds ratio: 2.43). Secondary analyses of Gleason score did not show any difference with respect to core length.

However, it is unknown whether prostate tumors arise well differentiated and then progress to less differentiated forms or if Gleason grade is an early and largely unchanging feature. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening has reduced the proportion of tumors diagnosed at advanced stage, which allows assessment of this question on a population level. If Gleason grade progresses as stage does, one would expect a similar reduction in high-grade tumors. We studied 1,207 Physicians' Health Study and Health Professionals Follow-up Study participants diagnosed with prostate cancer from 1982 to 2004 and treated with prostatectomy. We compared the distribution of grade and clinical stage across the pre-PSA and PSA screening eras. We re-reviewed grade using the ISUP 2005 revised criteria. The proportion of advanced stage tumors dropped more than six-fold, from the earliest period (12/1982-1/1993), 19.9% stage ≥ T3, to the latest (5/2000-12/2004), 3% stage T3, none T4. The proportion of Gleason score ≥ 8 decreased substantially less, from 25.3% to 17.6%. A significant interaction between stage and diagnosis date predicting grade (P = 0.04) suggests that the relationship between grade and stage varies by time period. As the dramatic shift in stage since the introduction of PSA screening was accompanied by a more modest shift in Gleason grade, these findings suggest that grade may be established early in tumor pathogenesis. This has implications for the understanding of tumor progression and prognosis, and may help patients diagnosed with lower grade disease feel more comfortable choosing active surveillance.""","""['Kathryn L Penney', 'Meir J Stampfer', 'Jaquelyn L Jahn', 'Jennifer A Sinnott', 'Richard Flavin', 'Jennifer R Rider', 'Stephen Finn', 'Edward Giovannucci', 'Howard D Sesso', 'Massimo Loda', 'Lorelei A Mucci', 'Michelangelo Fiorentino']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Cancer Res""","""['Should we replace the Gleason score with the amount of high-grade prostate cancer?', 'Gleason inflation 1998-2011: a registry study of 97,168 men.', 'Risk of Pathologic Upgrading or Locally Advanced Disease in Early Prostate Cancer Patients Based on Biopsy Gleason Score and PSA: A Population-Based Study of Modern Patients.', 'Radical prostatectomy for impalpable prostate cancer: the Johns Hopkins experience with tumors found on transurethral resection (stages T1A and T1B) and on needle biopsy (stage T1C).', 'Prostate cancer staging and grading at radical prostatectomy over time.', 'Grade Group accuracy is improved by extensive prostate biopsy sampling, but unrelated to prostatectomy specimen sampling or use of immunohistochemistry.', 'Neighbourhood social deprivation and risk of prostate cancer.', 'LncRNA/miRNA/mRNA Network Introduces Novel Biomarkers in Prostate Cancer.', 'Association of Prostate-Specific Antigen Levels with Prostate Cancer Risk in a Multiethnic Population: Stability Over Time and Comparison with Polygenic Risk Score.', 'Differences in Prostate Cancer Transcriptomes by Age at Diagnosis: Are Primary Tumors from Older Men Inherently Different?']"""

Intermediate end points are needed in order to conduct such trials within a more feasible time frame.  Patients and methods:   This is a retrospective analysis of 450 men with BRPC following prostatectomy treated at a single institution between 1981 and 2010, of which 140 developed subsequent metastases. Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) was deferred until after the development of metastases. Cox regression models were developed to investigate factors influencing OS.  Results:   Median metastasis-free survival (MFS) was 10.2 years [95% confidence interval (CI) 7.6-14.0 years]; median OS after metastasis was 6.6 years (95%CI 5.8-8.4 years). Multivariable Cox regressions identified four independently prognostic variables for OS: MFS (HR 0.77; 95% CI 0.63-0.94), number of metastases (≤3 versus ≥4; HR 0.50; 95% CI 0.29-0.85), pain (absent versus present; HR 0.43; 95% CI 0.25-0.72), and bisphosphonate use (yes versus no; HR 0.60; 95% CI 0.37-0.98).

Imaging living systems with hyperpolarized agents can result in more than 10,000-fold enhancement in signal relative to conventional magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. When combined with the rapid acquisition of in vivo ¹³C MR data, it is possible to evaluate the distribution of agents such as [1-¹³C]pyruvate and its metabolic products lactate, alanine, and bicarbonate in a matter of seconds. Preclinical studies in cancer models have detected elevated levels of hyperpolarized [1-¹³C]lactate in tumor, with the ratio of [1-¹³C]lactate/[1-¹³C]pyruvate being increased in high-grade tumors and decreased after successful treatment. Translation of this technology into humans was achieved by modifying the instrument that generates the hyperpolarized agent, constructing specialized radio frequency coils to detect ¹³C nuclei, and developing new pulse sequences to efficiently capture the signal. The study population comprised patients with biopsy-proven prostate cancer, with 31 subjects being injected with hyperpolarized [1-¹³C]pyruvate. The median time to deliver the agent was 66 s, and uptake was observed about 20 s after injection. No dose-limiting toxicities were observed, and the highest dose (0.43 ml/kg of 230 mM agent) gave the best signal-to-noise ratio for hyperpolarized [1-¹³C]pyruvate. The results were extremely promising in not only confirming the safety of the agent but also showing elevated [1-¹³C]lactate/[1-¹³C]pyruvate in regions of biopsy-proven cancer.

The androgen receptor regulates a large repertoire of genes central to the identity and behaviour of prostate cancer cells, and functions in a ligand-independent fashion in many prostate cancers when they become hormone refractory after initial androgen deprivation therapy. Here we report that two lncRNAs highly overexpressed in aggressive prostate cancer, PRNCR1 (also known as PCAT8) and PCGEM1, bind successively to the androgen receptor and strongly enhance both ligand-dependent and ligand-independent androgen-receptor-mediated gene activation programs and proliferation in prostate cancer cells. Binding of PRNCR1 to the carboxy-terminally acetylated androgen receptor on enhancers and its association with DOT1L appear to be required for recruitment of the second lncRNA, PCGEM1, to the androgen receptor amino terminus that is methylated by DOT1L. Unexpectedly, recognition of specific protein marks by PCGEM1-recruited pygopus 2 PHD domain enhances selective looping of androgen-receptor-bound enhancers to target gene promoters in these cells. In 'resistant' prostate cancer cells, these overexpressed lncRNAs can interact with, and are required for, the robust activation of both truncated and full-length androgen receptor, causing ligand-independent activation of the androgen receptor transcriptional program and cell proliferation. Conditionally expressed short hairpin RNA targeting these lncRNAs in castration-resistant prostate cancer cell lines strongly suppressed tumour xenograft growth in vivo. Together, these results indicate that these overexpressed lncRNAs can potentially serve as a required component of castration-resistance in prostatic tumours.""","""['Liuqing Yang#', 'Chunru Lin#', 'Chunyu Jin', 'Joy C Yang', 'Bogdan Tanasa', 'Wenbo Li', 'Daria Merkurjev', 'Kenneth A Ohgi', 'Da Meng', 'Jie Zhang', 'Christopher P Evans', 'Michael G Rosenfeld']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Nature""","""['Gene regulation: Long RNAs wire up cancer growth.', 'Long and noncoding RNAs (lnc-RNAs) determine androgen receptor dependent gene expression in prostate cancer growth in vivo.', 'Long noncoding RNA-mediated activation of androgen receptor in prostate cancer.', 'Re: lncRNA-dependent mechanisms of androgen-receptor-regulated gene activation programs.', 'Long and noncoding RNAs (lnc-RNAs) determine androgen receptor dependent gene expression in prostate cancer growth in vivo.', 'The long non-coding RNA PCGEM1 is regulated by androgen receptor activity in vivo.', 'A long noncoding RNA connects c-Myc to tumor metabolism.', 'Long non-coding RNA: A newly deciphered ""code"" in prostate cancer.', ""Long noncoding RNAs and prostate carcinogenesis: the missing 'linc'?"", 'HOXDeRNA activates a cancerous transcription program and super-enhancers genome-wide.', 'Pan-cancer whole-genome comparison of primary and metastatic solid tumours.', 'Long non-coding RNAs in bone metastasis: progresses and perspectives as potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers.', 'Aid or Antagonize: Nuclear Long Noncoding RNAs Regulate Host Responses and Outcomes of Viral Infections.', 'Importance of long non-coding RNAs in the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of prostate cancer.']"""

Immunohistochemistry measured Androgen receptor expression phosphorylated at serine residues 94 (pAR94), 308 (pAR308), 650(pAR650) and 791 (pAR791). No correlations with clinical parameters were observed for pAR94 or pAR650 in HNPC or CRPC tumours. In contrast to our previous observation with serine 213, high pAR308 is significantly associated with a longer time to disease specific death (p = 0.011) and high pAR791 expression significantly associated with a longer time to disease recurrence (p = 0.018) in HNPC tumours and longer time to death from disease recurrence (p = 0.040) in CRPC tumours. This observation in CRPC tumours was attenuated in high apoptotic tumours (p = 0.022) and low proliferating tumours (p = 0.004).

Management is based on small-cell lung carcinoma. Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) is not routinely administered in EPSCC. This study investigates the role of PCI in EPSCC, by analyzing the incidence, treatment, and survival of patients with brain metastases in a national cohort. Disease biology and epidemiology are also investigated.  Methods:   Patients diagnosed with primary EPSCC from the National Cancer Registry of Ireland from 1995 to 2007 were identified. The number of patients who developed brain metastases, their survival, and treatment data were documented. Patients who received PCI were investigated. Patient and disease characteristics, treatment, and survival data were stratified by stage and primary site.  Results:   Two hundred eighty patients were identified; 141 (50.4%) were men and 139 (49.6%) were women. One hundred eighty six patients (66.4%) had extensive-stage disease, 65 (23.2%) had limited-stage disease, and in 29 patients (10.3%) the stage was unknown. Eighteen patients (6.4%) developed brain metastases, with a median overall survival of 10.1 months. Eleven (61%) received cranial irradiation, and 12 (67%) received palliative chemotherapy. Two patients in the entire cohort (0.17%) received PCI. The most common primary sites included the esophagus (n = 43; 15.4%), cervix uteri (n = 17; 6.0%), bladder (n = 13; 4.6%), and prostate (n = 10; 3.6%). Median overall survival was 15.2 months (10.2-20.6) for limited-stage disease, 2.3 months (1.7-3.1) for extensive-stage EPSCC, and 3.7 months (1.3-8.3) for disease of unknown stage.  Conclusion:   Brain metastases were uncommon in EPSCC compared with small-cell lung carcinoma.

Downstaging was noted in 36.4 and 0% of cT1c-2N0M0 patients and in 74.1 and 20.0% of cT3N0M0 patients in the NHT and SA groups, respectively. For both cT1c-2N0M0 and cT3N0M0 patients, the downstaging rate was significantly higher in the NHT group than in the SA group (p＜0.01). Positive resection margin rates were significantly lower in the NHT group (34.2%) than in the SA group (65.7%) (p＜0.01). The overall prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression-free rate did not differ significantly between the 2 groups in both pT0-2N0M0 and pT3N0M0 patients. However, in pT0-2N0M0 patients with negative resection margins, the 5-year PSA progression-free rate was significantly lower in the NHT group than in the SA group (p＜0.01), whereas this rate did not differ significantly between the groups in both pT0-2N0M0 and pT3N0M0 patients with positive resection margins. Although NHT seemed to have some effect on downstaging, its pathological effects could be underestimated. Thus, NHT was considered to have no significant effect on biochemical failure.""","""['Masayuki Kobayashi', 'Yoshitaka Saito', 'Atsushi Komaru', 'Satoshi Fukasawa', 'Takahito Suyama', 'Koichiro Akakura', 'Tomohiko Ichikawa', 'Takeshi Ueda']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Hinyokika Kiyo""","""['Update on Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center studies of neoadjuvant hormonal therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Effect of total androgen ablation on pathologic stage and resection limit status of prostate cancer.

With up to 18 years of follow-up, we analyzed rates of survival among all study participants and among those with prostate cancer.  Methods:   We collected data on the incidence of prostate cancer among PCPT participants for an additional year after our first report was published in 2003 and searched the Social Security Death Index to assess survival status through October 31, 2011.  Results:   Among 18,880 eligible men who underwent randomization, prostate cancer was diagnosed in 989 of 9423 (10.5%) in the finasteride group and 1412 of 9457 (14.9%) in the placebo group (relative risk in the finasteride group, 0.70; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.65 to 0.76; P<0.001). Of the men who were evaluated, 333 (3.5%) in the finasteride group and 286 (3.0%) in the placebo group had high-grade cancer (Gleason score, 7 to 10) (relative risk, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.37; P=0.05). Of the men who died, 2538 were in the finasteride group and 2496 were in the placebo group, for 15-year survival rates of 78.0% and 78.2%, respectively. The unadjusted hazard ratio for death in the finasteride group was 1.02 (95% CI, 0.97 to 1.08; P=0.46). Ten-year survival rates were 83.0% in the finasteride group and 80.9% in the placebo group for men with low-grade prostate cancer and 73.0% and 73.6%, respectively, for those with high-grade prostate cancer.  Conclusions:   Finasteride reduced the risk of prostate cancer by about one third. High-grade prostate cancer was more common in the finasteride group than in the placebo group, but after 18 years of follow-up, there was no significant between-group difference in the rates of overall survival or survival after the diagnosis of prostate cancer.

However, the accuracy of clinical prediction of minimal prostate cancer (MPC) is unclear.  Objectives:   To define preoperative predictors for MPC in prostatectomy specimens and to examine the accuracy of such prediction.  Methods:   Data collected on 1526 consecutive radical prostatectomy patients operated in a single center between 2003 and 2008 included: age, body mass index, preoperative prostate-specific antigen level, biopsy Gleason score, clinical stage, percentage of positive biopsy cores, and maximal core length (MCL) involvement. MPC was defined as < 5% of prostate volume involvement with organ-confined Gleason score < or = 6. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to define independent predictors of minimal disease. Classification and Regression Tree (CART) analysis was used to define cutoff values for the predictors and measure the accuracy of prediction.  Results:   MPC was found in 241 patients (15.8%). Clinical stage, biopsy Gleason's score, percent of positive biopsy cores, and maximal involved core length were associated with minimal disease (OR 0.42, 0.1, 0.92, and 0.9, respectively). Independent predictors of MPC included: biopsy Gleason score, percent of positive cores and MCL (OR 0.21, 095 and 0.95, respectively). CART showed that when the MCL exceeded 11.5%, the likelihood of MPC was 3.8%. Conversely, when applying the most favorable preoperative conditions (Gleason < or = 6, < 20% positive cores, MCL < or = 11.5%) the chance of minimal disease was 41%.  Conclusions:   Biopsy Gleason score, the percent of positive cores and MCL are independently associated with MPC. While preoperative prediction of significant prostate cancer was accurate, clinical prediction of MPC was incorrect 59% of the time.

This study establishes pain characteristics in the mCRPC population using a PRO measure.  Materials and methods:   Patients with prostate cancer participated in an anonymous survey at five US comprehensive cancer centers in the Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Consortium that incorporated the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), analgesic use, and interference with daily activities. Prevalence and severity of cancer-related pain and analgesic use were tabulated according to castration-resistant status and exposure to docetaxel chemotherapy.  Results:   Four hundred sixty-one patients with prostate cancer participated, of whom 147 had mCRPC involving bone (61% [89 of 147] docetaxel exposed, 39% [58 of 147] docetaxel naive). Pain of any level was more common among docetaxel-exposed versus docetaxel-naive patients with mCRPC (70% [62 of 89] v 38% [22 of 58], respectively; P<.001). BPI score≥4 was reported by 38% (34 of 89) of docetaxel-pretreated and 24% (14 of 58) of docetaxel-naive patients with mCRPC; 40% of these patients with pain intensity≥4 reported no current narcotic analgesic.  Conclusion:   Pain prevalence and severity were higher in patients with prior docetaxel exposure. Analgesics were underutilized.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the patterns of delivery of palliative RT across the United States.  Methods:   Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare linked database, 51,610 patients were identified with incident stage IV breast, prostate, lung, or colorectal cancer diagnosed between 2000 and 2007 and observed through 2009. Multivariate logistic regression determined predictors of palliative RT.  Results:   Forty-one percent of the study population received palliative RT, including 53% of patients with lung cancer, followed by those with breast (42%), prostate (40%), and colorectal cancers (12%). Multivariate analysis revealed that older patients (P<.001) and those with higher Charlson comorbidity scores (P<.001) were less likely to receive palliative RT. Black patients with prostate cancer were 20% less likely (P<.001), and black patients with colorectal cancer were 28% less likely (P<.001), than white patients to receive palliative RT. Among those treated with RT, 23% of patients with lung cancer died within 2 weeks of completing treatment, followed by those with colorectal (12%), breast (11%), and prostate cancers (8%). In addition to tumor site, significant predictors (P<.05) of death within 2 weeks of receiving RT included increased age, increased comorbidity, and male sex.  Conclusion:   Inequality in the receipt of palliative RT exists among the elderly and patients with comorbid conditions and varies with race. In addition, a significant number of patients die shortly after receiving RT. Understanding these patterns of care, along with further research into the underlying causes, will improve access and quality of palliative RT.""","""['James D Murphy', 'Lorene M Nelson', 'Daniel T Chang', 'Loren K Mell', 'Quynh-Thu Le']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Oncol Pract""","""['Age disparity in palliative radiation therapy among patients with advanced cancer.', 'Radiation therapy at the end of life: a population-based study examining palliative treatment intensity.', 'Use of palliative radiotherapy among patients with metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer.', 'Treatment disparities for disabled medicare beneficiaries with stage I non-small cell lung cancer.', 'Palliative Radiation Therapy: The Role of Radiation Therapy in Palliative and End-of-Life Care.', 'Palliative Radiotherapy for Symptomatic Locally Advanced Breast Cancer.', 'Palliative Care Delivery Systems and Integration With Palliative Care Teams.', ""Pilot Study Evaluating Cross-Disciplinary Educational Material to Improve Patients' Knowledge of Palliative Radiation Therapy."", 'Safety and Feasibility of Radiation Therapy Combined with CDK 4/6 Inhibitors in the Management of Advanced Breast Cancer.', 'Quality of life improvement in patients with bone metastases undergoing palliative radiotherapy.']"""

Results from prior studies have been mixed but generally support an association between circadian disruption and prostate cancer. Our aim was to investigate the relationship between shiftwork and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test obtained as part of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) study.  Methods:   We combined three NHANES surveys (2005-2010) to obtain current work schedule among employed men aged 40 to 65 years with no prior history of cancer (except nonmelanoma skin cancer). Men who reported working regular night shifts or rotating shifts were considered shiftworkers. We obtained the total and percentage free PSA test results for these men and dichotomized total PSA into less than 4.0 ng/mL or 4.0 ng/mL or greater and total PSA of 4.0 ng/mL or greater combined with percentage free PSA less than or equal to 25%. Using multivariable logistic regression models, we compared PSA level among current shiftworkers and nonshiftworkers. All statistical tests were two-sided.  Results:   We found a statistically significant, age-adjusted association between current shiftwork and elevated PSA at the 4.0 ng/mL or greater level (odds ratio = 2.48, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.08 to 5.70; P = .03). The confounder-adjusted odds ratio was 2.62 (95% CI = 1.16 to 5.95; P = .02). The confounder-adjusted odds ratio for those with total PSA of 4.0 ng/mL or greater and free PSA less than or equal to 25% was 3.13 (95% CI = 1.38 to 7.09; P = .01).  Conclusions:   We observed a strong positive association with shiftwork and elevated PSA level.

Mutation analysis confirmed a non-classical 21-hydroxylase deficiency, that is, a mild form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). To suppress adrenocorticotrophic hormone and the excess adrenal androgen secretion, treatment with hydrocortisone and prednisolone was started with success.

Methods:   TAX-3501 was a randomized, phase 3, adjuvant study post-radical prostatectomy (RP) in high-risk patients with prostate cancer (n=228) comparing 18 months of HT with (CHT) without docetaxel chemotherapy either immediately (I) or deferred (D). High-risk disease was defined as a 5-year freedom-from-disease-progression rate of ≤ 60% as predicted by a post-RP nomogram. Progression-free survival (PFS), including prostate-specific antigen disease recurrence, was the primary endpoint. The authors also assessed the accuracy of the nomogram and analyzed testosterone recovery in 108 patients treated with HT who had at least 1 posttreatment testosterone value.  Results:   Between December 2005 and September 2007, 228 patients were randomized between the treatment cohorts. TAX-3501 was terminated prematurely because of enrollment challenges, leaving it underpowered to detect differences in PFS. After a median follow-up of 3.4 years (interquartile range, 2.3-3.8 years), 39 of 228 patients (17%) demonstrated PSA disease progression, and metastatic disease progression occurred in 1 patient. The median time to baseline testosterone recovery after the completion of treatment was prolonged at 487 days (95% confidence interval, 457-546 days). The nomogram's predicted versus observed freedom from disease progression was significantly different for the combination D(HT) and D(CHT) group (P<.00001).  Conclusions:   TAX-3501 illustrated several difficulties involved in conducting postoperative adjuvant systemic trials in men with high-risk prostate cancer: the lack of consensus regarding patient selection and treatment, the need for long follow-up time, nonvalidated intermediate endpoints, evolving standard approaches, and the need for long-term research support.

Especially in tumors of higher grade malignancy, dose escalation up to 80,0 Gy seems to be an advantage; however rectum toxicity can be a problem. By injecting a synthetic hydrogel (SpaceOAR®) as a spacer between the prostate and rectum, rectal toxicity can be reduced. We report on our experiences with 47 patients and an average follow-up of 241 days.  Methods:   From February 2012 to November 2012, 47 patients were included in the study series. Before external radiotherapy the hydrogel was injected between prostate and rectum in the so-called Denovier space. This interdisciplinary procedure was carried out with the patient under general anesthesia using transrectal ultrasound guidance and video documentation. The patients were hospitalized for 1 day. The exact position of the gel was assessed by means of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Radiotherapy was initiated 7-14 days after gel application in a dose escalation manner by means of intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) up to a dose of 80,0 Gy. Average follow-up was 241 (100-386, SD 91) days.  Results:   No early side effects specific for the application were observed. The achieved distance between rectum and the mid-plane of the prostate gland was on average 13.8 (6-24, SD=3.8) mm. Calculated V70 (rectal volume irradiated with 70.0 Gy or more) could be reduced to an average of 1.5 (0-8, SD=1.7) %. One patient showed an asymptomatic lesion of the rectal mucosa after irradiation with 38,0 Gy. This lesion was closely controlled and gel penetration was found. As a result radiotherapy was discontinued. Without further treatment the necrosis had completely healed 3 months later.  Conclusions:   Hydrogel application between prostate and rectum allows dose escalation up to 80,0 Gy and seems to reduce morbidity in patients with localized prostate cancer receiving radiotherapy. However, before final judgement of the new technique further studies must follow.""","""['T Klotz', 'M J Mathers', 'Y Lazar', 'B Gagel']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Urologe A""","""['Hydrogel Spacer Prospective Multicenter Randomized Controlled Pivotal Trial: Dosimetric\xa0and Clinical Effects of Perirectal Spacer Application in Men Undergoing Prostate\xa0Image Guided Intensity Modulated Radiation\xa0Therapy.', 'Prospective evaluation of a hydrogel spacer for rectal separation in dose-escalated intensity-modulated radiotherapy for clinically localized prostate cancer.', 'Feasibility of and rectal dosimetry improvement with the use of SpaceOAR® hydrogel for dose-escalated prostate cancer radiotherapy.', 'Prostate-rectum spacers: optimization of prostate cancer irradiation.', 'High-dose-rate brachytherapy for prostate cancer in a previously radiated patient with polyethylene glycol hydrogel spacing to reduce rectal dose: case report and review of the literature.', 'Dose-escalated radiotherapy to 82\xa0Gy for prostate cancer following insertion of a peri-rectal hydrogel spacer: 3-year outcomes from a phase II trial.', 'Rectal Perforation by a Balloon Spacer: A Rare Cause of Rectal Perforation Addressed Endoscopically.', 'Rectum-spacer related acute toxicity - endoscopy results of 403 prostate cancer patients after implantation of gel or balloon spacers.', 'Interdisciplinary consensus statement on indication and application of a hydrogel spacer for prostate radiotherapy based on experience in more than 250 patients.', 'Rectal ulcer associated with SpaceOAR hydrogel insertion during prostate brachytherapy.']"""

Thrombospondin-4 (THBS4) is known to have roles in cellular migration, adhesion and attachment, as well as proliferation in different contexts. Data to support a role in cancer biology is increasing, including for gastrointestinal and prostate tumours. Here, using a combination of immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence and analysis of publicly available genomic and expression data, we present the first study describing the pattern of expression of THBS4 in normal breast and breast cancer. THBS4 was located to the basement membrane of large ducts and vessels in normal breast tissue, but was absent from epithelium and extracellular matrix. There was a significant induction in expression in cancer-associated stroma relative to normal stroma (P = 0.0033), neoplastic epithelium (P < 0.0001) and normal epithelium (P < 0.0001). There was no difference in stromal expression of THBS4 between invasive ductal carcinomas (IDC) and invasive lobular carcinomas (ILC). The THBS4 mRNA levels were variable yet were generally highest in tumours typically rich in stromal content (ILC, ER positive low grade IDC; luminal A and normal-like subtypes). Genomic alterations of the THBS4 gene (somatic mutations and gene copy number) are rare suggesting this dramatic activation in expression is most likely dynamically regulated through the interaction between invading tumour cells and stromal fibroblasts in the local microenvironment. In summary, THBS4 expression in breast cancer-associated extracellular matrix contributes to the activated stromal response exhibited during tumour progression and this may facilitate invasion of tumour cells.""","""['Amy E McCart Reed', 'Sarah Song', 'Jamie R Kutasovic', 'Lynne E Reid', 'Jordan M Valle', 'Ana Cristina Vargas', 'Chanel E Smart', 'Peter T Simpson']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Virchows Arch""","""['THBS4, a novel stromal molecule of diffuse-type gastric adenocarcinomas, identified by transcriptome-wide expression profiling.', 'The clinicopathological significance of Thrombospondin-4 expression in the tumor microenvironment of gastric cancer.', 'Gene expression profiling of tumour epithelial and stromal compartments during breast cancer progression.', 'Tumor-associated stromal cells as key contributors to the tumor microenvironment.', 'Stromal cells in tumor microenvironment and breast cancer.', 'Unusual Suspects: Bone and Cartilage ECM Proteins as Carcinoma Facilitators.', 'Using publicly available datasets to identify population-based transcriptomic landscape contributing to the aggressiveness of breast cancer in young women.', 'A 9‑gene expression signature to predict stage development in resectable stomach adenocarcinoma.', 'Comprehensive characterisation of immunogenic cell death in melanoma revealing the association with prognosis and tumor immune microenvironment.', 'Diagnosing pleural effusions using mass spectrometry-based multiplexed targeted proteomics quantitating mid- to high-abundance markers of cancer, infection/inflammation and tuberculosis.']"""

We previously provided proof-of-concept that Stat5a/b is a therapeutic target protein for prostate cancer. Here, we show that pharmacologic targeting of Jak2-dependent Stat5a/b signaling by the Jak2 inhibitor AZD1480 blocks castrate-resistant growth of prostate cancer.  Experimental design:   Efficacy of AZD1480 in disrupting Jak2-Stat5a/b signaling and decreasing prostate cancer cell viability was evaluated in prostate cancer cells. A unique prostate cancer xenograft mouse model (CWR22Pc), which mimics prostate cancer clinical progression in patients, was used to assess in vivo responsiveness of primary and castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) to AZD1480. Patient-derived clinical prostate cancers, grown ex vivo in organ explant cultures, were tested for responsiveness to AZD1480.  Results:   AZD1480 robustly inhibited Stat5a/b phosphorylation, dimerization, nuclear translocation, DNA binding, and transcriptional activity in prostate cancer cells. AZD1480 reduced prostate cancer cell viability sustained by Jak2-Stat5a/b signaling through induction of apoptosis, which was rescued by constitutively active Stat5a/b. In mice, pharmacologic targeting of Stat5a/b by AZD1480 potently blocked growth of primary androgen-dependent as well as recurrent castrate-resistant CWR22Pc xenograft tumors, and prolonged survival of tumor-bearing mice versus vehicle or docetaxel-treated mice. Finally, nine of 12 clinical prostate cancers responded to AZD1480 by extensive apoptotic epithelial cell loss, concurrent with reduced levels of nuclear Stat5a/b.  Conclusions:   We report the first evidence for efficacy of pharmacologic targeting of Stat5a/b as a strategy to inhibit castrate-resistant growth of prostate cancer, supporting further clinical development of Stat5a/b inhibitors as therapy for advanced prostate cancer.""","""['Lei Gu', 'Zhiyong Liao', 'David T Hoang', 'Ayush Dagvadorj', 'Shilpa Gupta', 'Shauna Blackmon', 'Elyse Ellsworth', 'Pooja Talati', 'Benjamin Leiby', 'Michael Zinda', 'Costas D Lallas', 'Edouard J Trabulsi', 'Peter McCue', 'Leonard Gomella', 'Dennis Huszar', 'Marja T Nevalainen']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Clin Cancer Res""","""['Structure-Based Screen Identifies a Potent Small Molecule Inhibitor of Stat5a/b with Therapeutic Potential for Prostate Cancer and Chronic Myeloid Leukemia.', 'STAT5A/B Blockade Sensitizes Prostate Cancer to Radiation through Inhibition of RAD51 and DNA Repair.', 'Inhibition of STAT3 with orally active JAK inhibitor, AZD1480, decreases tumor growth in Neuroblastoma and Pediatric Sarcomas In vitro and In vivo.', 'Androgen receptor-dependent and -independent mechanisms driving prostate cancer progression: Opportunities for therapeutic targeting from multiple angles.', 'Transcription factor Stat5a/b as a therapeutic target protein for prostate cancer.', 'Expression and prognostic role of STAT5a across cancer types.', 'Novel biomarkers predict prognosis and drug-induced neuroendocrine differentiation in patients with prostate cancer.', 'Down-regulation of hepatic expression of GHR/STAT5/IGF-1 signaling pathway fosters development and aggressiveness of HCV-related hepatocellular carcinoma: Crosstalk with Snail-1 and type 2 transforming growth factor-beta receptor.', 'Choosing Kinase Inhibitors for Androgen Deprivation Therapy-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Second-Generation Jak2 Inhibitors for Advanced Prostate Cancer: Are We Ready for Clinical Development?']"""

Our previous results indicated that Cdk5 activates androgen receptor (AR) and supports prostate cancer growth. We also found that STAT3 is a target of Cdk5 in promoting thyroid cancer cell growth, whereas STAT3 may play a role as a regulator to AR activation under cytokine control. In this study, we investigated the regulation of Cdk5 and its activator p35 on STAT3/AR signaling in prostate cancer cells. Our results show that Cdk5 biochemically interacts with STAT3 and that this interaction depends on Cdk5 activation in prostate cancer cells. The phosphorylation of STAT3 at Ser⁷²⁷ (p-Ser⁷²⁷-STAT3) is regulated by Cdk5 in cells and xenograft tumors. The mutant of STAT3 S727A reduces its interaction with Cdk5. We further show that the nuclear distribution of p-Ser⁷²⁷-STAT3 and the expression of STAT3-regulated genes (junB, c-fos, c-myc, and survivin) are regulated by Cdk5 activation. STAT3 mutant does not further decrease cell proliferation upon Cdk5 inhibition, which implies that the role of STAT3 regulated by Cdk5 correlates to cell proliferation control. Interestingly, Cdk5 may regulate the interaction between STAT3 and AR through phosphorylation of Ser⁷²⁷-STAT3 and therefore upregulate AR protein stability and transactivation. Correspondingly, clinical evidence shows that the level of p-Ser⁷²⁷-STAT3 is significantly correlated with Gleason score and the levels of upstream regulators (Cdk5 and p35) as well as downstream protein (AR). In conclusion, this study demonstrates that Cdk5 regulates STAT3 activation through Ser⁷²⁷ phosphorylation and further promotes AR activation by protein-protein interaction in prostate cancer cells.""","""['Fu-Ning Hsu', 'Mei-Chih Chen', 'Kuan-Chia Lin', 'Yu-Ting Peng', 'Pei-Chi Li', 'Eugene Lin', 'Ming-Ching Chiang', 'Jer-Tsong Hsieh', 'Ho Lin']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Am J Physiol Endocrinol Metab""","""['Regulation of androgen receptor and prostate cancer growth by cyclin-dependent kinase 5.', 'Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 acts as a critical determinant of AKT-dependent proliferation and regulates differential gene expression by the androgen receptor in prostate cancer cells.', 'Future Aspects of CDK5 in Prostate Cancer: From Pathogenesis to Therapeutic Implications.', 'Stress kinase signaling regulates androgen receptor phosphorylation, transcription, and localization.', 'Regulatory processes affecting androgen receptor expression, stability, and function: potential targets to treat hormone-refractory prostate cancer.', 'Antrodia salmonea Extracts Regulate p53-AR Signaling and Apoptosis in Human Prostate Cancer LNCaP Cells.', 'Cdk5 regulates IP3R1-mediated Ca2+ dynamics and Ca2+-mediated cell proliferation.', 'Physical Interaction between Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 5 (CDK5) and Clock Factors Affects the Circadian Rhythmicity in Peripheral Oscillators.', 'RET Regulates Human Medullary Thyroid Cancer Cell Proliferation through CDK5 and STAT3 Activation.', 'The Role of CDK5 in Tumours and Tumour Microenvironments.']"""

Increased LPCAT1 expression was associated with advanced tumor stage (pT3b/T4) (p < 0.0001), high Gleason score (≥4 + 4) (p < 0.0001), positive nodal involvement (p = 0.0002), positive surgical margin (p = 0.0005), and early PSA recurrence (p < 0.0001). High LPCAT1 expression was strongly linked to ERG-fusion type prostate cancer. Strong LPCAT1 staining was detected in 45.3% of ERG positive but in only 16.7% of ERG negative tumors (p < 0.0001). Within ERG negative cancers, LPCAT1 staining was strongly increased within the subgroup of PTEN deleted cancers (p < 0.0001). Further subgroup analyses revealed that associations of high LPCAT1 expression with PSA recurrence and unfavorable tumor phenotype were largely driven by ERG negative cancers (p < 0.0001) while these effects were substantially mitigated in ERG positive cancers (p = 0.0073).

This difficulty is accentuated in patients with distal tumors and high body mass index (BMI), in which the surgical margins and the hypogastric nerves may be affected. Therefore, robotic surgery aims to overcome these limitations that conspire against the mininvasive surgical approach of rectal cancer. We present an obese (BMI = 32 kg/m2) 82-year-old man with a history of smoking and prostate cancer that was recently diagnosed with a middle rectal adenocarcinoma at 9 cm from the anal verge. Rectal examination evidenced a mobile lesion. Computed tomography scan ruled out metastases and at the local staging by MRI, the tumor was considered as T3-N0 with free circumferential margins. Surgical treatment was decided and a hybrid technique was used combining an initial laparoscopic approach followed by the robotic TME. The patient had a full recovery and was discharged three days after surgery without complications. Pathological examination revealed a low-grade adenocarcinoma with mesorectal invasion, free circumferential and distal margins, and 24 negative lymph nodes (pT3-pN0-pM0/Stage II).

In LNCaP and PC-3 cells, LCA triggered the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis and cell death induced by LCA was partially dependent on the activation of caspase-8 and -3. Moreover, LCA increased cleavage of Bid and Bax, down-regulation of Bcl-2, permeabilization of the mitochondrial outer membrane and activation of caspase-9. The cytotoxic actions of LCA occurred despite the inability of this bile acid to enter the prostate cancer cells with about 98% of the nominal test concentrations present in the extracellular culture medium.

The genomic region 13q14 is frequently deleted in tumour tissues of both sporadic and familial PCa patients and is consequently recognised as a possible locus of tumour suppressor gene(s). Deletions of this region have been found in many other cancers. Recently, we showed that homozygous carriers for the T442C variant of the ARLTS1 gene (ADP-ribosylation factor-like tumour suppressor protein 1 or ARL11, located at 13q14) are associated with an increased risk for both unselected and familial PCa. Furthermore, the variant T442C was observed in greater frequency among malignant tissue samples, PCa cell lines and xenografts, supporting its role in PCa tumourigenesis. In this study, 84 PCa cases and 15 controls were analysed for ARLTS1 expression status in blood-derived RNA. A statistically significant (p = 0.0037) decrease of ARLTS1 expression in PCa cases was detected. Regulation of ARLTS1 expression was analysed with eQTL (expression quantitative trait loci) methods. Altogether fourteen significant cis-eQTLs affecting the ARLTS1 expression level were found.

Abnormally increased expression of mTOR was associated with carcinogenesis, and its functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) may regulate the expression of mTOR and thus contribute to cancer risk.  Methodology/principal findings:   In a hospital-based case-control study of 1004 prostate cancer (PCa) cases and 1051 cancer-free controls, we genotyped six potentially functional SNPs of mTOR (rs2536 T>C, rs1883965 G>A, rs1034528 G>C, rs17036508 T>C, rs3806317 A>G, and rs2295080 T>G) and assessed their associations with risk of PCa by using logistic regression analysis.  Conclusions/significances:   In the single-locus analysis, we found a significantly increased risk of PCa associated with mTOR rs2536 CT/CC and rs1034528 CG/CC genotypes [adjusted OR = 1.42 (1.13-1.78), P = 0.003 and 1.29 (1.07-1.55), P = 0.007), respectively], compared with their common homozygous genotypes, whereas mTOR rs2295080 GT/GG genotypes were associated with a decreased risk of PCa [adjusted OR = 0.76 (0.64-0.92), P = 0.003], compared with wild-type TT genotypes. In the combined analysis of the six SNPs, we found that individuals carrying two or more adverse genotypes had an increased risk of PCa [adjusted OR = 1.24 (1.04-1.47), P = 0.016], compared with individuals carrying less than two adverse genotypes. In the multiple dimension reduction analysis, body mass index (BMI) was the best one-factor model with the highest CVC (100%) and the lowest prediction error (42.7%) among all seven factors. The model including an interaction among BMI, rs17036508, and rs2536 was the best three-factor model with the highest CVC (100%) and the lowest prediction error of 41.9%.

Androgens function via the androgen receptor (AR), a ligand-dependent transcription factor. To assay and localise AR activity in vivo we generated the transgenic ""ARE-Luc"" mouse, expressing a luciferase reporter gene under the control of activated endogenous AR. In vivo imaging of androgen-mediated luciferase activity revealed several strongly expressing tissues in the male mouse as expected and also in certain female tissues. In males the testes, prostate, seminal vesicles and bone marrow all showed high AR activity. In females, strong activity was seen in the ovaries, uterus, omentum tissue and mammary glands. In both sexes AR expression and activity was also found in salivary glands, the eye (and associated glands), adipose tissue, spleen and, notably, regions of the brain. Luciferase protein expression was found in the same cell layers as androgen receptor expression. Additionally, mouse AR expression and activity correlated well with AR expression in human tissues. The anti-androgen bicalutamide reduced luciferase signal in all tissues. Our model demonstrates that androgens can act in these tissues directly via AR, rather than exclusively via androgen aromatisation to estrogens and activation of the estrogen receptor. Additionally, it visually demonstrates the fundamental importance of AR signalling outside the normal role in the reproductive organs.

EF24 induces apoptosis in these cells apparently by inhibiting miR-21 expression, and also enhances the expression of several miR-21 target genes, PTEN and PDCD4. EF24 treatment significantly suppressed the growth of DU145 prostate cancer xenografts in immunocompromised mice and resulted in tumor regression. EF24 enhanced the expression of the miR-21 target PTEN in DU145 tumor tissue, but suppressed the expression of markers of proliferating cells (cyclin D1 and Ki67). In syngeneic mice injected with B16 cells, EF24 treatment inhibited the formation of lung metastasis, prolonged animal survival, inhibited miR-21 expression and increased the expression of miR-21 target genes. Expression profiling of miRNAs regulated by EF24 in vitro and in vivo showed that the antitumor activity of EF24 reflected the enhanced expression of potential tumor suppressor miRNAs as well as the suppressed expression of oncogenic miRNAs, including miR-21.

Aberrant E2F regulatory activity is often caused by impairment of control through pRB function, but little is known about the interplay of other oncoproteins with E2F. Here we show that ETS transcription factor fusions resulting from disease driving rearrangements in Ewing sarcoma (ES) and prostate cancer (PC) are one such class of oncoproteins. We performed an integrative study of genome-wide DNA-binding and transcription data in EWSR1/FLI1 expressing ES and TMPRSS2/ERG containing PC cells. Supported by promoter activity and mutation analyses, we demonstrate that a large fraction of E2F3 target genes are synergistically coregulated by these aberrant ETS proteins. We propose that the oncogenic effect of ETS fusion oncoproteins is in part mediated by the disruptive effect of the E2F-ETS interaction on cell cycle control. Additionally, a detailed analysis of the regulatory targets of the characteristic EWSR1/FLI1 fusion in ES identifies two functionally distinct gene sets. While synergistic regulation in concert with E2F in the promoter of target genes has a generally activating effect, EWSR1/FLI1 binding independent of E2F3 is predominantly associated with repressed differentiation genes.

Transwell assays revealed that VEGF-C receptor, VEGFR-3, as well as chemokine CCL21 receptor, CC chemokine receptor 7 (CCR7), were responsible for the migration of PC3 cells toward hypoxia preconditioned MSCs. Knock-in Ccr7 in PC3 cells also improved cell migration in vitro. Furthermore, when PC3 cells were labeled using the hrGfp-lentiviral vector, and were combined with hypoxia preconditioned MSCs for xenografting, it resulted in an enhancement of lymph node metastases accompanied by up-regulation of VEGFR-3 and CCR7 in primary tumors. Both PI3K/Akt/IκBα and JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathways were activated in xenografts in the presence of hypoxia-preconditioned MSCs. Unexpectedly, the p-VEGFR-2/VEGFR-2 ratio was attenuated accompanied by decreased JAK1 expression, indicating a switching-off of potential vascular signal within xenografts in the presence of hypoxia-preconditioned MSCs. Unlike results from other studies, VEGF-C maintained a stable expression in both conditions, which indicated that hypoxia preconditioning of MSCs did not influence VEGF-C secretion.

The present study reveals, for the first time, that the prominent antiestrogen, tamoxifen, is a pan-effective AC inhibitor in the low, single digit micromolar range, as demonstrated in a wide spectrum of cancer cell types, prostate, pancreatic, colorectal, and breast. Prostate cancer cells were chosen for the detailed investigations. Treatment of intact PC-3 cells with tamoxifen produced time- and dose-dependent inhibition of AC activity. Tamoxifen did not impact cell viability nor did it inhibit AC activity in cell-free assays. In pursuit of mechanism of action, we demonstrate that tamoxifen induced time-, as early as 5min, and dose-dependent, as low as 5μM, increases in lysosomal membrane permeability (LMP), and time- and dose-dependent downregulation of AC protein expression. Assessing various protease inhibitors revealed that a cathepsin B inhibitor blocked tamoxifen-elicited downregulation of AC protein; however, this action failed to restore AC activity unless assayed in a cell-free system at pH4.5. In addition, pretreatment with tamoxifen inhibited PC-3 cell migration. Toremifene, an antiestrogen structurally similar to tamoxifen, was also a potent inhibitor of AC activity.

The tumor-bearing mice were randomly divided into 2 groups: the control group and the experimental group. When the tumor volume grew to about 300 mm(3), the plasmids prepared previously were injected into the tail veins of the mice once at the dose of 2 μg/g in the experimental group, whereas the mice in the control group was injected with the same amount of saline as control. The tumor volumes were monitored every other day until 14 days after the treatment.At the endpoint,the mice were sacrificed and the tumors were excised, weighed, fixed in buffered-formalin, and embedded in paraffin for the immunohistochemical analysis of AR,Ki-67 (a marker of proliferative cell) levels and apoptotic cell labeling by TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transterase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling) assay. A semiquantitative immunohistochemical scoring system, HSCORE system, was used to evaluate the expression of AR and proliferative index/Ki-67 labeling index (PI/Ki-67 LI) and apoptotic index (AI) were used to assess the cell proliferation and cell apoptosis, respectively.  Results:   Compared with the control group, the treatment induced an evident inhibitory effect on the tumor growth in the nude mice with prostate cancer. At the endpoint, the tumor volume of (1 199.56±86.48) mm(3) in the experimental group was significantly smaller than that of (1 742.02±98.16) mm3 in the control group (P=0.002). The tumor weight of (1 006.2±79.1) mg in the experimental group significantly decreased compared with that of (1 383.4±74.8) mg in the control group (P=0.005). The AR HSCORE,PI and AI in the experimental group were 25.8±6.7, (26.0±3.1)%, (55.6±7.9)%, respectively, and those in the control group were 268.8± 18.7, (87.6±7.9)%, (27.2±3.9)%, respectively. There were significant differences between the two groups (all P<0.01).  Conclusion:   AR shRNA could be injected intravenously to suppress the expression of AR in vivo and hence inhibit the growth of human prostate cancer xenograft in nude mice.""","""['Tian Wang', 'Qing-quan Xu', 'Xiao-bo Huang', 'Xiao-feng Wang']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Beijing Da Xue Xue Bao Yi Xue Ban""","""['Effect and mechanism of gene therapy of lentivirus mediated RhoA shRNA on ovarian cancer xenograft in vivo.', 'Adeno-associated virus-delivered short hairpin-structured RNA for androgen receptor gene silencing induces tumor eradication of prostate cancer xenografts in nude mice: a preclinical study.', 'Effects of anti-gene and antisense therapeutics on human prostate cancer xenograft in nude mice.', 'Inhibitory effect of silencing hTERT gene by short hairpin RNA on growth of human laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma xenograft in nude mice.', 'Use of nude mouse xenograft models in prostate cancer research.']"""

Methods:   The clinical features of 32 NA patients were obtained. Each case underwent microscopic observation and immumohistochemical staining.

The present study sought to identify patient, tumor and treatment characteristics associated with the pre-RT PSA in prostate cancer patients.  Methods:   We reviewed the charts of all patients diagnosed with intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer and treated with a combination of neoadjuvant (median, 2.2 and 2.5 months, respectively), concurrent, and adjuvant ADT and RT between 1990 and 2011.  Results:   A total of 170 intermediate- and 283 high-risk patients met inclusion criteria. On multivariate analysis, both intermediate- and high-risk patients with higher pre-treatment PSA (iPSA) were significantly less likely to achieve a pre-RT PSA <0.5 ng ml(-1) (iPSA 10.1-20 ng ml(-1): P=0.005 for intermediate risk; iPSA 10.1-20 ng ml(-1): P=0.005, iPSA >20 ng ml(-1): P<0.001 for high risk). High-risk patients undergoing total androgen blockade were more likely to achieve a pre-RT PSA <0.5 ng ml(-1) (P=0.031). We observed an interaction between race and type of neoadjuvant ADT (P=0.074); whereas African-American men on total androgen blockade reached pre-RT PSA <0.5 ng ml(-1) as frequently as other men on total androgen blockade (P=0.999), African-American men on luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LH-RH) agonist monotherapy/orchiectomy were significantly less likely to reach pre-RT PSA <0.5 ng ml(-1) compared with other men on LH-RH monotherapy/orchiectomy (P=0.001).  Conclusions:   Our findings suggest that total androgen blockade in the neoadjuvant period may be beneficial compared with LH-RH monotherapy for achieving a pre-RT PSA <0.5 ng ml(-1) in African-American men with high-risk prostate cancer. In addition, men with higher iPSA are more likely to have a pre-RT PSA greater than 0.5 ng ml(-1) in response to neoadjuvant ADT and are therefore candidates for clinical trials testing newer, more aggressive hormone-ablative therapies.""","""['J Z Cerne', 'S E McGuire', 'S R Grant', 'M F Munsell', 'A K Lee', 'R J Kudchadker', 'S L Choi', 'U Mahmood', 'K E Hoffman', 'T J Pugh', 'S J Frank', 'D A Kuban']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['PSA response to neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy is a strong independent predictor of survival in high-risk prostate cancer in the dose-escalated radiation therapy era.', 'Neoadjuvant hormonal therapy in prostate cancer - impact of PSA level before radiotherapy.', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen After Neoadjuvant Androgen Suppression in Prostate Cancer Patients Receiving Short-Term Androgen Suppression and External Beam Radiation Therapy: Pooled Analysis of Four NRG Oncology Radiation Therapy Oncology Group Randomized Clinical Trials.', 'EAU guidelines on prostate cancer.

Piperine treatment resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of the proliferation of these cell lines. Cell cycle arrest at G₀/G₁ was induced and cyclin D1 and cyclin A were downregulated upon piperine treatment. Notably, the level of p21(Cip1) and p27(Kip1) was increased dose-dependently by piperine treatment in both LNCaP and DU145 but not in PC-3 cells, in line with more robust cell cycle arrest in the former two cell lines than the latter one. Although piperine induced low levels of apoptosis, it promoted autophagy as evidenced by the increased level of LC3B-II and the formation of LC3B puncta in LNCaP and PC-3 cells. The piperine-induced autophagic flux was further confirmed by assaying LC3-II accumulation and LC3B puncta formation in the presence of chloroquine, a well-known autophagy inhibitor.

Whilst inhibitory I-Smad7 was found to be the preferred substrate for full-length WWP2-FL and a WWP2-C isoform, WWP2-FL also formed a stable complex with an N-terminal WWP2 isoform (WWP2-N) in the absence of TGFβ, and rapidly stimulated activating Smad2/3 turnover. Here, using stable knockdown experiments we show that specific depletion of individual WWP2 isoforms impacts differentially on Smad protein levels, and in WWP2-N knockdown cells we unexpectedly find spontaneous expression of the EMT marker vimentin. Re-introduction of WWP2-N into WWP2-N knockout cells also repressed TGFβ-induced vimentin expression. In support of the unique role for WWP2-N in regulating TGFβ/Smad functional activity, we then show that a novel V717M-WWP2 mutant in the MZ7-mel melanoma cell line forms a stable complex with the WWP2-N isoform and promotes EMT by stabilizing Smad3 protein levels. Finally, we report the first analysis of WWP2 expression in cancer cDNA panel arrays using WWP2 isoform-specific probes and identify unique patterns of WWP2 isoform abundance associated with early/advanced disease stages. WWP2-N is significantly downregulated in stage IIIC melanoma and up-regulated in stage II/III prostate cancer, and we also find isolated examples of WWP2-FL and WWP2-C overexpression in early-stage breast cancer. Together, these data suggest that individual WWP2 isoforms, and particularly WWP2-N, could play central roles in tumourigenesis linked to aberrant TGFβ-dependent signalling function, and also have potential as both prognostic markers and molecular therapeutic targets.""","""['Surinder M Soond', 'Paul G Smith', 'Lloyd Wahl', 'Tracey E Swingler', 'Ian M Clark', 'Andrew M Hemmings', 'Andrew Chantry']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Biochim Biophys Acta""","""['Smad7 Binds Differently to Individual and Tandem WW3 and WW4 Domains of WWP2 Ubiquitin Ligase Isoforms.', 'Selective targeting of activating and inhibitory Smads by distinct WWP2 ubiquitin ligase isoforms differentially modulates TGFβ signalling and EMT.', 'WWP2 ubiquitin ligase and its isoforms: new biological insight and promising disease targets.', 'E3 Ubiquitin Ligases: Key Regulators of TGFβ Signaling in Cancer Progression.', 'Reprogramming during epithelial to mesenchymal transition under the control of TGFβ.', 'miR-328-5p Induces Human Intervertebral Disc Degeneration by Targeting WWP2.', 'E2UbcH5B-derived peptide ligands target HECT E3-E2 binding site and block the Ub-dependent SARS-CoV-2 egression: A computational study.', 'The HECT family of E3 ubiquitin ligases and PTEN.', 'Incorporating genetic networks into case-control association studies with high-dimensional DNA methylation data.', 'Smad7 Binds Differently to Individual and Tandem WW3 and WW4 Domains of WWP2 Ubiquitin Ligase Isoforms.']"""

A total of 100 preoperatively potent men, aged <65 years, with scores on the Erectile Function domain of the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-EF) ≥26, underwent nerve-sparing surgery. The patients were randomized to either nightly sildenafil and on-demand placebo (nightly sildenafil group), or on-demand sildenafil and nightly placebo (on-demand sildenafil group; maximum on-demand dose six tablets/month) for 12 months. Patients then underwent a 1-month washout period.

Patients and methods:   Prostate cancer cases were identified from the database and digoxin exposure at prostate cancer diagnosis was identified from prescription claims. Digoxin users were matched to non-users using a propensity score to identify men with similar cardiovascular comorbidity. Adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated for the association between digoxin exposure and all-cause and prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM). Analyses were repeated in the propensity score-matched cohort. Effect modification of treatment with radiation or androgen-deprivation therapy by digoxin exposure was also assessed.  Results:   In all, 5732 men with a prostate cancer diagnosis (2001-2006) were identified (digoxin exposed, 391). The median follow-up was 4.3 years. Digoxin exposure was associated with a small non-significant increase in PCSM in the full cohort (HR 1.13, 95% CI 0.91, 1.42) and the propensity. score-matched cohort (HR 1.17, 95% CI 0.88, 1.57). Adjusted HRs for all-cause mortality were increased for digoxin exposed men (HR 1.24, 95% CI 1.07, 1.43). Interactions with treatments received were not significant.

Patients and methods:   Eligibility criteria for PRAP include age 35-69 years with a family history of prostate cancer, African-American ethnicity regardless of family history, and known BRCA gene mutations. The genome-wide association study markers assessed included rs2736098 (5p15.33), rs10993994 (10q11), rs10788160 (10q26), rs11067228 (12q24), rs4430796 (17q12) and rs17632542 (19q13.33).

The biopsy trajectories of every core taken were documented in three dimensions (3D) in a 3D-prostate model. Every core was evaluated separately for prostate cancer and the performed biopsy trajectories were projected on mpMRI images. PIRADS scores of 1177 cores were then assessed by a histology 'blinded' uro-radiologist in T2-weighted (T2W), dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE), diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS).  Results:   The PIRADS score was significantly higher in cores positive for cancer than in negative cores. There was a significant correlation between the PIRADS score and histopathology for every modality.

The TGFβ1 and its receptors have an important role in tumor progression, being the pro-apoptotic function modulated by the expression of TGFBR2. A single nucleotide polymorphism -875 G > A in TGFBR2 gene has been described, which may influence the expression levels of the receptor. Our purpose was to investigate the potential role of TGFBR2-875G>A in PC risk and in the response to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). TGFBR2-875G>A polymorphism was studied by allelic discrimination using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in 891 patients with PC and 874 controls. A follow-up study was undertaken to evaluate response to ADT. The TGFBR2 and SMAD7 mRNA expression were analyzed by a quantitative real-time PCR. We found that TGFBR2-875GG homozygous patients present lower expression levels of TGFBR2 mRNA (AA/AG: 2(-ΔΔCT) =1.5, P=0.016). GG genotype was also associated with higher Gleason grade (OR=1.51, P=0.019) and increased risk of an early relapse after ADT (HR=1.47, P=0.024).

The TGFBR2-875G>A contribution to an early relapse in ADT patients, due to changes in mRNA expression, supports the involvement of TGFβ1 pathway in CRPC.

In this study, the diagnostic and prognostic properties of miR-96 expression levels were investigated by qRT-PCR in two well documented prostate cancer cohorts. The miR-96 expression was found to be significantly higher in prostate cancer patients and correlate with WHO grade, and decreased overall survival time; patients with low levels of miR-96 lived 1.5 years longer than patients with high miR-96 levels. The therapeutic potential was further investigated in vitro, showing that ectopic levels of miR-96 enhances growth and cellular proliferation in prostate cancer cells, implying that miR-96 has oncogenic properties in this setting. We demonstrate that miR-96 expression decreases the transcript and protein levels of FOXO1 by binding to one of two predicted binding sites in the FOXO1 3'UTR sequence. Blocking this binding site completely inhibited the growth enhancement conveyed by miR-96. This finding was corroborated in a large external prostate cancer patient cohort where miR-96 expression inversely correlated to FOXO1 expression. Taken together these findings indicate that miR-96 plays a key role in prostate cancer cellular proliferation and can enhance prostate cancer progression.

We studied mitochondria isolated from normal prostate epithelial cells (PrEC), metastatic prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP, PC-3, DU145; and non-prostate cancer cells - human fibrosarcoma HT1080 cells; and normal human lymphoblastoid cells. PrEC cells contained 2 to 4 times less mitochondria per gram of cells than the three PC cell lines. Respiratory activities of PrEC cell mitochondria were 5-20-fold lower than PC mitochondria, depending on substrates and the metabolic state, due to lower content and lower activity of the respiratory enzyme complexes. Mitochondria from the three metastatic prostate cancer cell lines revealed several features that are distinctive only to these cells: low affinity of Complex I for NADH, 20-30 mV higher electrical membrane potential (ΔΨ). Unprotected with cyclosporine A (CsA) the PC-3 mitochondria required 4 times more Ca²⁺ to open the permeability transition pore (mPTP) when compared with the PrEC mitochondria, and they did not undergo swelling even in the presence of alamethicin, a large pore forming antibiotic. In the presence of CsA, the PC-3 mitochondria did not open spontaneously the mPTP. We conclude that the low apoptotic potential of the metastatic PC cells may arise from inhibition of the Ca²⁺-dependent permeability transition due to a very high ΔΨ and higher capacity to sequester Ca²⁺. We suggest that due to the high ΔΨ, mitochondrial metabolism of the metastatic prostate cancer cells is predominantly based on utilization of glutamate and glutamine, which may promote development of cachexia.""","""['Alexander Panov', 'Zulfiya Orynbayeva']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Expression of estrogen receptor (ER)-alpha and ER-beta in normal and malignant prostatic epithelial cells: regulation by methylation and involvement in growth regulation.', 'Chemosensitization of androgen-independent prostate cancer with neutral endopeptidase.', 'Constitutively active Akt is an important regulator of TRAIL sensitivity in prostate cancer.', 'Overexpression of BCL-X(L) underlies the molecular basis for resistance to staurosporine-induced apoptosis in PC-3 cells.', 'STAMPing into Mitochondria.', 'Immunoproteasome-specific subunit PSMB9 induction is required to regulate cellular proteostasis upon mitochondrial dysfunction.', 'High resolution respirometry of isolated mitochondria from adult Octopus maya (Class: Cephalopoda) systemic heart.', 'Sex as Biological Variable in Cardiac Mitochondrial Bioenergetic Responses to Acute Stress.', 'Defining the interactome of the human mitochondrial ribosome identifies SMIM4 and TMEM223 as respiratory chain assembly factors.', 'Curcumin and Carnosic Acid Cooperate to Inhibit Proliferation and Alter Mitochondrial Function of Metastatic Prostate Cancer Cells.']"""

We recently demonstrated that a key transcription factor for lipogenesis, sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 (SREBP-1), induced fatty acid and lipid accumulation and androgen receptor (AR) transcriptional activity, and also promoted prostate cancer cell growth and castration resistance. SREBP-1 was overexpressed in human prostate cancer and castration-resistant patient specimens. These experimental and clinical results indicate that SREBP-1 is a potential oncogenic transcription factor in prostate cancer. In this study, we identified two miRNAs, miR-185 and 342, that control lipogenesis and cholesterogenesis in prostate cancer cells by inhibiting SREBP-1 and 2 expression and down-regulating their targeted genes, including fatty acid synthase (FASN) and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase (HMGCR). Both miR-185 and 342 inhibited tumorigenicity, cell growth, migration and invasion in prostate cancer cell culture and xenograft models coincident with their blockade of lipogenesis and cholesterogenesis. Intrinsic miR-185 and 342 expression was significantly decreased in prostate cancer cells compared to non-cancerous epithelial cells.

In order to further understand how miRNA expression may contribute to prostate tumour growth and progression, we evaluated expression of miRNA in two invasive prostate tumour lines, PC3 and DU145, and compared it to that in normal prostate epithelial cells. Although a number of miRNAs were differentially expressed, we focused our analysis on miR-105, a novel miRNA not previously linked to prostate cancer. miR-105 levels were significantly decreased in both tumour cell lines in comparison to normal prostate epithelial cells. To determine its potential role in prostate cancer pathogenesis, we overexpressed miR-105 in both PC3 and DU145 cells and determined its effect on various tumourigenic properties. miR-105 overexpression inhibited tumour cell proliferation, tumour growth in anchorage-independent three-dimensional conditions and tumour invasion in vitro, properties of highly aggressive tumour cells.

We further identified CDK6 as a putative target of miR-105 which is likely a main contributor to the inhibition of tumour cell growth observed in our assays.

More experimentally validated miRNA-disease associations have been accumulated recently. On the basis of these associations, it is essential to predict disease miRNAs for various human diseases. It is useful in providing reliable disease miRNA candidates for subsequent experimental studies.  Methodology/principal findings:   It is known that miRNAs with similar functions are often associated with similar diseases and vice versa. Therefore, the functional similarity of two miRNAs has been successfully estimated by measuring the semantic similarity of their associated diseases. To effectively predict disease miRNAs, we calculated the functional similarity by incorporating the information content of disease terms and phenotype similarity between diseases. Furthermore, the members of miRNA family or cluster are assigned higher weight since they are more probably associated with similar diseases. A new prediction method, HDMP, based on weighted k most similar neighbors is presented for predicting disease miRNAs. Experiments validated that HDMP achieved significantly higher prediction performance than existing methods. In addition, the case studies examining prostatic neoplasms, breast neoplasms, and lung neoplasms, showed that HDMP can uncover potential disease miRNA candidates.  Conclusions:   The superior performance of HDMP can be attributed to the accurate measurement of miRNA functional similarity, the weight assignment based on miRNA family or cluster, and the effective prediction based on weighted k most similar neighbors.

Case series of salvage cryotherapy (SCT) in RRPC have reported promising disease free survival (DFS) outcomes and acceptable toxicity profile. While many men receive SCT, no predictive factors for treatment induced side effects are known. The aim of this study is to validate the oncologic outcome of SCT in a large multi-centre patient cohort and to identify potential parameters associated with an increased risk of micturition symptoms.  Patients and methods:   In this retrospective analysis, we studied 283 consecutive patients with RRPC treated by SCT in three independent U.K. centres (between 2001 and 2011). Two freeze-thaw cycles of transperineal cryotherapy were performed under transrectal ultrasound guidance by a single surgeon in each of the 3 sites. We analysed clinico-pathological factors against tumour response. Functional outcomes were assessed by continence status and IPSS questionnaire. Predictive factors for SCT-induced micturition symptoms were analysed in a sub-group (n=42) of consecutive cases.  Results:   We found that nadir post-SCT PSA levels strongly associated with DFS. The DFS rates at 12- and 36-month were 84% and 67% for the ≤ 1 ng/ml group and 56% and 14% for the >1 ng/ml group, respectively (p<0.001). Correlative analysis revealed highly significant association between patients' post-SCT micturition status with prostate gland and iceball lengths following SCT. Finally, in a reduction model, both gland length and maximal length of iceball were highly associated with patients' IPSS outcome (p<0.001).  Conclusion:   We report the largest European patient cohort treated with SCT for RRPC. Oncologic outcome guided by nadir PSA of <1 ng/ml is consistent with earlier single-centre series. For the first time, we identified physical parameters to predict micturition symptoms following SCT. Our data will directly assist on-going and future trial design in cryotherapy in prostate cancer.""","""['Imran Ahmad', 'Gabriela Kalna', 'Mohamed Ismail', 'Fiona Birrell', 'Sue Asterling', 'Elaine McCartney', 'Damien Greene', 'John Davies', 'Hing Y Leung']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Disease-free survival following salvage cryotherapy for biopsy-proven radio-recurrent prostate cancer.', 'Salvage cryotherapy for radiation-recurrent prostate cancer: outcomes and complications.', 'Percutaneous MR-guided focal cryoablation for recurrent prostate cancer following radiation therapy: retrospective analysis of iceball margins and outcomes.', 'Salvage cryoablation of the prostate: followup and analysis of predictive factors for outcome.', 'Local tumor control with salvage cryotherapy for locally recurrent prostate cancer after external beam radiotherapy.', 'Functional Outcomes after Local Salvage Therapies for Radiation-Recurrent Prostate Cancer Patients: A Systematic Review.', 'Salvage Therapy Options for Local Prostate Cancer Recurrence After Primary Radiotherapy: a Literature Review.', 'Comparative morbidity of ablative energy-based salvage treatments for radio-recurrent prostate cancer.', 'Decision analytic cost-effectiveness model to compare prostate cryotherapy to androgen deprivation therapy for treatment of radiation recurrent prostate cancer.', 'Feasibility study of a randomised controlled trial to compare (deferred) androgen deprivation therapy and cryotherapy in men with localised radiation-recurrent prostate cancer.']"""

Activation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), type 1 insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF1R), and crosstalk between these two signaling pathways have been implicated in the development of radiation resistance in PC. This study assessed the effects of targeting both receptors on the regulation of radio-sensitivity in PC cells. Specific inhibitors of EGFR and IGF1R, Erlotinib and AG1024, as well as siRNA targeting EGFR and IGF1R, were used to radio-sensitize PC cells. Our results showed that co-inhibiting both receptors significantly dampened cellular growth and DNA damage repair, and increased radio-sensitivity in PC cells. These effects were carried out through synergistic inhibition of homologous recombination-directed DNA repair (HRR), but not via inhibition of non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). Furthermore, the compromised HRR capacity was caused by reduced phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) and its subsequent interaction with Rad51. The synergistic effect of the EGFR and IGF1R inhibitors was also confirmed in nude mouse xenograft assay. This is the first study testing co-inhibiting EGFR and IGF1R signaling in the context of radio-sensitivity in PC and it may provide a promising adjuvant therapeutic approach to improve the outcome of PC patients to radiation treatment.""","""['Yong Wang', 'Jian Lin Yuan', 'Yun Tao Zhang', 'Jian Jun Ma', 'Peng Xu', 'Chang Hong Shi', 'Wei Zhang', 'Yu Mei Li', 'Qiang Fu', 'Guang Feng Zhu', 'Wei Xue', 'Yong Hua Lei', 'Jing Yu Gao', 'Juan Ying Wang', 'Chen Shao', 'Cheng Gang Yi', 'He Wang']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Genistein and AG1024 synergistically increase the radiosensitivity of prostate cancer cells.', 'STAT5A/B Blockade Sensitizes Prostate Cancer to Radiation through Inhibition of RAD51 and DNA Repair.', 'IGF-1R inhibition enhances radiosensitivity and delays double-strand break repair by both non-homologous end-joining and homologous recombination.', 'Targeting nonhomologous end-joining through epidermal growth factor receptor inhibition: rationale and strategies for radiosensitization.', 'IGF1R signalling and its inhibition.', 'Nuclear IGF1R interacts with NuMA and regulates 53BP1‑dependent DNA double‑strand break repair in colorectal cancer.', 'Improving the Efficacy of Tumor Radiosensitization Through Combined Molecular Targeting.', 'microRNAs identified in prostate cancer: Correlative studies on response to ionizing radiation.', 'New Phosphorylation Sites of Rad51 by c-Met Modulates Presynaptic Filament Stability.', 'Genistein and AG1024 synergistically increase the radiosensitivity of prostate cancer cells.']"""

Yet, identification of causal variants within an established region of association remains a challenge. Counter-intuitively, certain factors that increase power to detect an associated region can decrease power to localize the causal variant. First, combining GWAS with imputation or low coverage sequencing to achieve the large sample sizes required for high power can have the unintended effect of producing differential genotyping error among SNPs. This tends to bias the relative evidence for association toward better genotyped SNPs. Second, re-use of GWAS data for fine-mapping exploits previous findings to ensure genome-wide significance in GWAS-associated regions. However, using GWAS findings to inform fine-mapping analysis can bias evidence away from the causal SNP toward the tag SNP and SNPs in high LD with the tag. Together these factors can reduce power to localize the causal SNP by more than half. Other strategies commonly employed to increase power to detect association, namely increasing sample size and using higher density genotyping arrays, can, in certain common scenarios, actually exacerbate these effects and further decrease power to localize causal variants. We develop a re-ranking procedure that accounts for these adverse effects and substantially improves the accuracy of causal SNP identification, often doubling the probability that the causal SNP is top-ranked. Application to the NCI BPC3 aggressive prostate cancer GWAS with imputation meta-analysis identified a new top SNP at 2 of 3 associated loci and several additional possible causal SNPs at these loci that may have otherwise been overlooked.

YAP is a transcriptional coactivator that controls cellular responses through interaction with TEAD transcription factors in the nucleus, while its transcriptional functions are inhibited by phosphorylation-dependent translocation to the cytosol. YAP overexpression has been associated with different types of cancer, such as lung, skin, prostate, ovary and liver cancer. Recently, YAP was linked to E-cadherin-dependent regulation of contact inhibition in breast cancer cells.  Results:   In this study we examined YAP protein expression and cellular localization in 237 cases of human invasive breast cancer by immunohistochemistry and related its expression to clinicopathological features and E-cadherin expression. We observed that invasive lobular carcinoma is characterized by higher expression levels of both nuclear and cytosolic YAP (p < 0.001). Nuclear YAP expression did not associate with other variables such as lymph node involvement, tumor grade, tumor size, mitotic activity or the molecular sub-types of invasive breast cancer. We observed that high nuclear and cytosolic YAP expression are associated with the E-cadherin deficient breast cancer subtype ILC (p < 0.001) and cell lines derived from human breast cancers and conditional mouse models of human lobular breast cancer.  Conclusions:   Since our data indicate that nuclear YAP localization is more common in breast cancers lacking functional adherens junctions, it suggests that YAP-mediated transcription may be involved in the development and progression of invasive lobular breast cancer.""","""['Eva J Vlug', 'Robert A H van de Ven', 'Jeroen F Vermeulen', 'Peter Bult', 'Paul J van Diest', 'Patrick W B Derksen']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Cell Oncol (Dordr)""","""['Nuclear Kaiso expression is associated with high grade and triple-negative invasive breast cancer.', 'Low shear stress induces ERK nuclear localization and YAP activation to control the proliferation of breast cancer cells.', 'YAP expression in normal and neoplastic breast tissue: an immunohistochemical study.', 'Expression of YES-associated protein (YAP) and its clinical significance in breast cancer tissues.', ""Angiomotin'g YAP into the nucleus for cell proliferation and cancer development."", 'Verteporfin reverses progestin resistance through YAP/TAZ-PI3K-Akt pathway in endometrial carcinoma.', 'Irigenin inhibits glioblastoma progression through suppressing YAP/β-catenin signaling.', 'Chromatin accessibility landscape and active transcription factors in primary human invasive lobular and ductal breast carcinomas.', 'MICAL2 Contributes to Gastric Cancer Cell Proliferation by Promoting YAP Dephosphorylation and Nuclear Translocation.', 'Emerging Perspectives on Leukemia Inhibitory Factor and its Receptor in Cancer.']"""

This research will address this limitation by leveraging membrane-targeting mechanisms that increase lethal membrane permeabilization. Methods that directly modify membrane properties or change the pulse delivery timing are proposed that do not rely on cytotoxic agents. This work shows that significant enhancement (67-75% more cell destruction in vitro and >100% treatment volume increase in vivo) can be achieved using membrane-targeting approaches for IRE cancer destruction. The methods introduced are surfactants (i.e., DMSO) and pulse timing which are low cost, non-toxic, and easy to be incorporated into existing clinical use.

Materials and methods:   The CBCT data from six prostate cancer patients treated with hypofractionated intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) were independently reviewed off-line by four observers (one radiation oncologist, one junior and two senior RTTs) and benchmarked with on-line CBCT positioning performed by a radiation oncologist immediately prior to treatment. CBCT positioning was based on manual soft-tissue registration. Agreement between observers was evaluated using weighted Cohen's kappa statistics.  Results:   In total, 152 CBCT-based prostate positioning procedures were reviewed by each observer. The mean (± standard deviation) of the differences between off- and on-line CBCT-simCT registration translations along the three directions (antero-posterior, latero-lateral and cranio-caudal) and rotation around the antero-posterior axis were -0.7 (3.6) mm, 1.9 (2.7) mm, 0.9 (3.6) mm and -1.8 (5.0) degrees, respectively. Satisfactory interobserver agreement was found, being substantial (weighted kappa >0.6) in 10 of 16 comparisons and moderate (0.41-0.60) in the remaining six comparisons.  Conclusions:   CBCT interpretation performed by RTTs is comparable to that of radiation oncologists.

According to PRNCR1 gene sequence, siRNA fragments (PRNCR1-siRNA) were designed and synthesized to transfect C4-2 cells, and 48 h later, the expression of PRNCR1 mRNA was detected again by qRT-PCR to confirm the silence of PRNCR1. Thereafter, we determined the expression level of androgen receptor (AR) using Western blotting, and observed the change in the proliferation, apoptosis and invasion ability of C4-2 cells by means of MTT, flow cytometry and Transwell cell invasion assay, respectively.  Results:   Compared with LNCaP cells, the expression level of PRNCR1 mRNA in C4-2 cells increased significantly. After transfected with PRNCR1-siRNA to silence the PRNCR1 mRNA expression, the C4-2 cells showed the inhibited expression of AR protein, the depressed proliferation and invasion abilities and the increased apoptosis rate.

Generally, brassinosteroids are known for their cell expansion and cell division-promoting roles. Recently, EBR was shown as a potential apoptotic inducer in various cancer cells without affecting the non-tumor cell growth. Androgen signaling controls cell proliferation through the interaction with the androgen receptor (AR) in the prostate gland. Initially, the development of prostate cancer is driven by androgens. However, in later stages, a progress to the androgen-independent stage is observed, resulting in metastatic prostate cancer. The androgen-responsive or -irresponsive cells are responsible for tumor heterogeneity, which is an obstacle to effective anti-cancer therapy. Polyamines are amine-derived organic compounds, known for their role in abnormal cell proliferation as well as during malignant transformation. Polyamine catabolism-targeting agents are being investigated against human cancers. Many chemotherapeutic agents including polyamine analogs have been demonstrated to induce polyamine catabolism that depletes polyamine levels and causes apoptosis in tumor models. In our study, we aimed to investigate the mechanism of apoptotic cell death induced by EBR, related with polyamine biosynthetic and catabolic pathways in LNCaP (AR+), DU145 (AR-) prostate cancer cell lines and PNT1a normal prostate epithelial cell line. Induction of apoptotic cell death was observed in prostate cancer cell lines after EBR treatment. In addition, EBR induced the decrease of intracellular polyamine levels, accompanied by a significant ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) down-regulation in each prostate cancer cell and also modulated ODC antizyme and antizyme inhibitor expression levels only in LNCaP cells. Catabolic enzymes SSAT and PAO expression levels were up-regulated in both cell lines; however, the specific SSAT and PAO siRNA treatments prevented the EBR-induced apoptosis only in LNCaP (AR+) cells. In a similar way, MDL 72,527, the specific PAO and SMO inhibitor, co-treatment with EBR during 24 h, reduced the formation of cleaved fragments of PARP in LNCaP (AR+) cells.""","""['Pinar Obakan', 'Elif Damla Arisan', 'Annarica Calcabrini', 'Enzo Agostinelli', 'Sehnaz Bolkent', 'Narçin Palavan-Unsal']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Amino Acids""","""['Epibrassinolide-induced apoptosis regardless of p53 expression via activating polyamine catabolic machinery, a common target for androgen sensitive and insensitive prostate cancer cells.', 'CDK inhibitors induce mitochondria-mediated apoptosis through the activation of polyamine catabolic pathway in LNCaP, DU145 and PC3 prostate cancer cells.', 'Metabolic and antiproliferative consequences of activated polyamine catabolism in LNCaP prostate carcinoma cells.', 'Polyamine metabolism and cancer.', 'Inhibitors of polyamine metabolism: review article.', 'Gemcitabine in combination with epibrassinolide enhanced the apoptotic response in an ER stress-dependent manner and reduced the epithelial-mesenchymal transition in pancreatic cancer cells.', 'Epibrassinolide activates AKT to trigger autophagy with polyamine metabolism in SW480 and DLD-1 colon cancer cell lines.', 'Reduction of oxidative stress and ornithine decarboxylase expression in a human prostate cancer cell line PC-3 by a combined treatment with α-tocopherol and naringenin.', 'Therapeutic Potential of Brassinosteroids in Biomedical and Clinical Research.', 'SILAC-Based Mass Spectrometry Analysis Reveals That Epibrassinolide Induces Apoptosis via Activating Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress in Prostate Cancer Cells.']"""

Cox proportional hazards regression modeling was used to examine the relationship between glycemic control, including medication use, and cancer risk. The results varied by cancer type and medication exposure. There was no association between glycemic control and breast or colon cancer; however, prostate cancer risk was significantly higher with better glycemic control (hemoglobin A1c ≤ 7.0%).

Objective:   To determine whether the traditional Med-Diet pattern is associated with risk of incident advanced or lethal PCa and with PCa-specific and overall mortality among men with PCa.  Design, setting, and participants:   We prospectively followed 47 867 men in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study followed from 1986 to 2010. The case-only analysis included 4538 men diagnosed with nonmetastatic PCa, followed from diagnosis to lethal outcome or to January 2010.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   We used Cox proportional hazards models to examine traditional and alternative Med-Diet scores in relation to PCa incidence outcomes (advanced and lethal disease). In a case-only survival analysis, we examined postdiagnostic Med-Diet and risk of lethal (metastases or PCa death) and fatal PCa as well as overall mortality among men diagnosed with nonmetastatic disease.  Results and limitations:   Between 1986 and 2010, 6220 PCa cases were confirmed. The Med-Diet was not associated with risk of advanced or lethal PCa. In the case-only analysis, there was no association between the Med-Diet after diagnosis and risk of lethal or fatal PCa. However, there was a 22% lower risk of overall mortality (hazard ratio: 0.78; 95% confidence interval, 0.67-0.90; p(trend)=0.0007) among men with greater adherence to the Med-Diet after PCa diagnosis.

Material and method:   This was a cross-sectional study at the Health Check-up Clinic of Srinagarind Hospital between July 2008-2009. Recruits included 129 patients > 45 years of age. Prostatic specific antigen (PSA) was measured and patients with a high PSA level were counseled to undergo a transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided biopsy. The cancer detection rate was calculated and the specificity of the diagnostic test determined using the ROC curve. The Spearman correlation between the PSA level and the Gleason score was established.  Results:   The respective mean age and PSA level was 61 and 2.3 ng/ml. Thirteen patients had a PSA level > 4 ng/ml; all of whom underwent TRUS-guided biopsy; eight were positive for prostate adenocarcinoma. The prevalence of prostate cancer was thus 6.2% (8/129 patients). The specificity of the cut-off PSA level at 4 ng/ml as per the ROC curve was 40%.

Metastases locally disrupt normal bone remodeling. Although metastases from prostate cancer have been classified as osteoblastic based on the radiographic appearance of the lesion, data gleaned from a rapid autopsy program indicate that the same prostate cancer patient may have evidence of both osteolytic and osteoblastic disease as shown by histologic examinations. Thus, bone metastases are heterogeneous, requiring combined treatment targeting on both osteolytic and osteoblastic lesions. While Samarium-153 (Sm-153) oxabifore treatment is widely used for the relief of pain in patients with osteoblastic metastatic bone lesions, Xgeva (Denosumab) is indicated for the prevention of skeletal-related events in patients with bone metastases from solid tumors. It is a fully human monoclonal antibody that has been designed to target receptor activator of nuclear factor-kB ligand (RANKL), a protein that acts as the primary signal to promote bone removal. In many bone loss conditions, RANKL overwhelms the body's natural defense against bone destruction. The main objectives of the current pilot study were to estimate the effectiveness of bone metastases treatment by a combination of Sm-153 oxabifore and Xgeva (Denosumab). Five patients (four female and one male, aged 35-64, mean age 50.8) with multiple skeletal metastases from prostatic carcinoma (1) and breast carcinoma (4) were studied. Their mean objective pain score according to visual analog scoring system on a 1-10 scoring system was 7.8 ± 0.5 (range 6-9). Sm-153 oxabifore was administered at the standard bone palliation dose of 37 MBq/kg body weight. Xgeva (Denosumab) was administered at a dosage of 120 mg every 4 weeks, with the monitoring of calcium level and administration of calcium, magnesium, and vitamin D. Whole body (WB) bone scan was performed before and 3 months after treatment in all patients. After Sm-153 oxabifore administration, pain relief occurred within 4.4 ± 1.25 days (range 2-9 days) and the objective pain score decreased to 0.2 ± 0.2 (range 0-1). There was statistically significant difference found, according to the pain score system, before and after treatment (P < 0.0001). WB bone scan showed that in one patient, there was significant reduction in the number and intensity of bone metastases, and in four patients, there was no evidence of bone metastases found.

IGFs and their binding proteins (IGFBPs) are important mediators of the effects of nutrition on growth and play a key role in the development of PCa. We used DU145, PC3 and LNCaP PCa cell lines to examine how hyperglycaemia altered their response to docetaxel. Trypan Blue dye-exclusion assay was used to determine the percentage of cell death. Protein abundance was determined using western immunoblotting. Levels of IGFBP2 were measured using an ELISA. IGFBP2 gene silencing was achieved using siRNA technology. DNA methylation was assessed using combined bisulphide restriction analysis. Acetylation status of histones H3 and H4 associated with IGFBP2 gene was assessed using chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Hyperglycaemia reduced docetaxel-induced apoptosis by 40% for DU145 cells and by 88% for LNCaP cells. This reduced cell death was mediated by a glucose-induced up-regulation of IGFBP2, as silencing IGFBP2 negated the survival effect of high glucose. Glucose increased IGFBP2 via increasing the acetylation of histones associated with the IGFBP2 gene promoter.

Although many mechanisms for its anticancer activity have been proposed, tumor suppressor gene re-expression through promoter demethylation emerged as one of the more plausible.  Methods:   We conducted an open-label, dose escalation trial of disulfiram in men with non-metastatic recurrent PCa after local therapy. Dose escalation occurred if a demethylating 'response' (that is, 10% decrease in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) global 5-methyl cytosine (5(me)C) content) was observed in <3 patients in cohort 1. Cohorts 1 and 2 received disulfiram 250 mg and 500 mg daily, respectively. The primary end point was the proportion of subjects with a demethylation response. Secondary end points included the rate of PSA progression at 6 months, changes in PSA doubling time and safety/tolerability.  Results:   Changes in global 5(me)C content were observed in two of nine patients (22.2%) in cohort 1 and 3 of 10 (30.0%) in cohort 2. Only five subjects were on trial for 6 months, all were in cohort 1 and all had PSA progression by 6 months. No changes in PSA kinetics were observed in either cohort. Disulfiram was poorly tolerated with six patients experiencing grade 3 adverse events (three per cohort). Three of the responders displayed pretreatment instability in their 5(me)C content.  Conclusions:   A minority of patients had transient global PBMC demethylation changes. Instability in 5(me)C may limit the reproducibility of these findings, limiting our ability to confirm our hypothesis. Given the toxicities and no clinical benefits, further development of disulfiram should not be pursued in this population.""","""['M T Schweizer', 'J Lin', 'A Blackford', 'A Bardia', 'S King', 'A J Armstrong', 'M A Rudek', 'S Yegnasubramanian', 'M A Carducci']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['Disulfiram is a DNA demethylating agent and inhibits prostate cancer cell growth.', 'A phase I study to repurpose disulfiram in combination with temozolomide to treat newly diagnosed glioblastoma after chemoradiotherapy.', 'Activity and safety of ODM-201 in patients with progressive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (ARADES): an open-label phase 1 dose-escalation and randomised phase 2 dose expansion trial.', 'Azacitidine favorably modulates PSA kinetics correlating with plasma DNA LINE-1 hypomethylation in men with chemonaïve castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'A non-comparative randomized phase II study of 2 doses of ATN-224, a copper/zinc superoxide dismutase inhibitor, in patients with biochemically recurrent hormone-naïve prostate cancer.', 'Co-delivery of a tumor microenvironment-responsive disulfiram prodrug and CuO2 nanoparticles for efficient cancer treatment.', 'Recent progress in DNA methyltransferase inhibitors as anticancer agents.', 'Effect of Disulfiram and Copper Plus Chemotherapy vs Chemotherapy Alone on Survival in Patients With Recurrent Glioblastoma: A Randomized Clinical Trial.', 'Cuproptosis: mechanisms and links with cancers.', 'Mouse pharmacokinetics and metabolism of the phenylurea thiocarbamate NSC 161128.']"""

To address this, we conducted two nested case-control studies within prospective cohorts of men undergoing radical prostatectomy for newly diagnosed PCa.  Methods:   We identified 1817 men with BMI 30 kg m(-2) (cases) and 1244 men with BMI <25 kg m(-2) (controls) who underwent surgery to treat PCa at Mayo Clinic in Rochester between 2000 and 2009.

We employed logistic regression models to evaluate the association of pathologic features of aggressiveness with obesity status.  Results:   After adjusting for age and PSA level, we noted that obese men in the Rochester population are more likely to present with Gleason grade 8-10 tumors (OR= 1.50; 95% CI 1.14-1.96; P=0.003) and pT3, pT4, pTxN+ stage disease (OR=1.30; 95% CI 1.05-1.62).

For the discovery phase, prostatectomy samples were dichotomized to high-risk (n = 27, biochemical failure <36 months after prostatectomy) and low-risk groups (n = 14, ≥ 36 months without biochemical failure). Expression of 754 mature miRNAs was compared between the 2 groups. Linear regression models were built to accurately predict biochemical failure risk. miRNA mimics were transfected into PCa model cell lines to test effects on proliferation and to deduce responding signaling pathways.  Results:   We identified 25 differentially expressed miRNAs between the biochemical failure risk groups. Based on the expression of 2-3 miRNAs, 3 logistic regression models were developed, each with a high positive predictive value. Candidate miRNAs and the best-performing model were also verified on an independent PCa set. miRNA-152, featured in the models, was further investigated by using cell line models and was shown to affect cell proliferation.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the NUCB2 expression in PCa tissues and adjacent non-cancerous tissues and its potential relevance to clinicopathological variables and prognosis.  Methods:   NUCB2 mRNA expression was determined by real-time quantitative real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction in 180 pairs of fresh frozen PCa tissues and corresponding non-cancerous tissues. Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to investigate the correlation between NUCB2 expression and prognosis of PCa patients.  Results:   Our results showed that the expression level of NUCB2 mRNA in PCa tissues was significantly higher than those in non-cancerous tissues. Our results indicated that the high expression of NUCB2 in PCa was associated with lymph node metastasis, preoperative PSA, Gleason score, and angiolymphatic invasion. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that patients with high NUCB2 expression have shorter biochemical recurrence (BCR)-free survival time compared to patients with low NUCB2 expression.

Methods and materials:   A cohort of 10 prostate patients was treated with PBS using a bilateral single-field uniform dose (SFUD) modality. Bilateral intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) plans were generated for comparison. Because beam-on time in PBS was intermittent, the actual beam-on time was determined from treatment logs. Prostate motion was generalized according to real-time Calypso tracking data from our previously reported prospective photon trial. We investigated potential dose deviations by considering the interplay effect resulting from the worst-case scenario motion and the PBS delivery sequence.  Results:   For both bilateral-field SFUD and IMPT plans, clinical target volume (CTV) D99% coverage was degraded <2% owing to prostate intrafraction motion when averaged over the course of treatment, but was >10% for the worst fraction. The standard deviation of CTV D99% distribution was approximately 1.2%. The CTV coverage of individual fields in SFUD plans degraded as time elapsed after the initial alignment, owing to prostate drift. Intensity-modulated proton therapy and SFUD demonstrated comparable results when bilateral opposed fields were used. Single-field SFUD plans that were repainted twice, which could reduce half of the treatment time, resulted in similar CTV coverage as bilateral-field plans.  Conclusions:   Intrafraction prostate motion affects the actual delivered dose to CTV; however, when averaged over the course of treatment, CTV D99% coverage degraded only approximately 2% even for the worst-case scenario. The IMPT plan results are comparable to those of the SFUD plan, and similar coverage can be achieved if treated by SFUD 1 lateral field per day when rescanning the field twice to shorten the treatment time and mitigate intrafraction motion.""","""['Shikui Tang', 'Curtiland Deville', 'James McDonough', 'Zelig Tochner', 'Ken Kang-Hsin Wang', 'Neha Vapiwala', 'Stefan Both']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Impact of intrafraction and residual interfraction effect on prostate proton pencil beam scanning.', 'Comparison of prostate proton treatment planning technique, interfraction robustness, and analysis of single-field treatment feasibility.', 'A dosimetric comparison of intensity-modulated proton therapy optimization techniques for pediatric craniopharyngiomas: a clinical case study.', 'Robust radiotherapy planning.', 'Proton beam therapy for the treatment of prostate cancer.', 'Prostate Cancer Treatment with Pencil Beam Proton Therapy Using Rectal Spacers sans Endorectal Balloons.', 'Dosimetric advantages of daily adaptive strategy in IMPT for high-risk prostate cancer.', 'Dosimetric effects of quality assurance-related setup errors in passive proton therapy for prostate cancer with and without a hydrogel spacer.', 'Analysis of intra-fraction prostate motion and derivation of duration-dependent margins for radiotherapy using real-time 4D ultrasound.', 'The Potential Role of Intensity-Modulated Proton Therapy in Hepatic Carcinoma in Mitigating the Risk of Dose De-Escalation.']"""

Little is known about the long-term impact of RP on continence.  Objective:   To elucidate the long-term progression of continence after RP.  Design, setting, and participants:   From October 2000 through September 2012, 1788 men undergoing open RP for clinically localized prostate cancer by a single surgeon at an urban tertiary care center prospectively signed consent to be followed before RP and at 3, 6, 12, 24, 96, and 120 mo after RP. A consecutive sampling method was used and all men were included in this study.  Intervention:   Men underwent open RP.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Regression models controlled for preoperative University of California, Los Angeles-Prostate Cancer Index urinary function score (UCLA-PCI-UFS), age, prostate-specific antigen level, Gleason score, stage, nerve-sparing status, race, and marital status were used to evaluate the association of time since RP with two dependent variables: UCLA-PCI-UFS and continence status.  Results and limitation:   The mean UCLA-PCI-UFS declined between 2 yr and 8 yr (83.8 vs 81.8; p=0.007) and marginally between 8 yr and 10 yr (81.8 vs 79.6; p=0.036) after RP, whereas continence rate did not significantly change during these intervals. Men ≥ 60 yr old experienced a decline in mean UCLA-PCI-UFS between 2 yr and 8 yr (p=0.002) and a marginal decline in continence rate between 2 yr and 10 yr (p=0.047), whereas these variables did not change significantly in men <60 yr old.

With abiraterone recently becoming available in the predocetaxel setting, it is warranted to identify subgroups of patients who may obtain the greatest benefit from docetaxel and particularly qualify for receiving docetaxel as first-line treatment for mCRPC.  Objective:   We aimed to identify factors that could characterize subgroups of patients who obtain the greatest benefit from the use of docetaxel.  Design, setting, and participants:   TAX327 was multinational, randomized, phase 3 study that was conducted from 2000 to 2002 in 1006 men with mCRPC.  Intervention:   Patients were randomized to receive docetaxel every 3 wk (D3), weekly docetaxel (D1), or mitoxantrone every 3 wk (M3), each with prednisone.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   We investigated whether patients with poorly differentiated tumors (Gleason score ≥7) at diagnosis had greater benefit from D3 compared with M3 than patients with better differentiated tumors (Gleason score ≤6). Using a Cox model, we compared overall survival (OS) between the treatment groups within each subgroup of Gleason score.  Results and limitations:   The TAX 327 data showed that the OS benefit of D3 versus M3 was greater in patients with high-grade tumors (median OS: 18.9 vs 14.5 mo; p=0.009) than in patients with low-grade tumors (median OS: 21.6 vs 20.7 mo; p=0.674). Limitations of a retrospective analysis apply.  Conclusions:   The survival benefit obtained with docetaxel is most pronounced in patients with high-Gleason-score tumors (Gleason ≥7). In a time of shifting paradigms in mCRPC, with abiraterone becoming available prior to docetaxel chemotherapy, Gleason score may help in selecting patients who obtain the greatest benefit from docetaxel as first-line treatment for mCRPC.

To ensure negative surgical margins and safely preserve the ureteral orifices during bladder neck transection, we propose the use of the transurethral resectoscope for making the incision in the bladder neck before initiating RALP. Thus, we developed a technique for bladder neck transection to facilitate this operation in such patients.  Case presentation:   Two Japanese men, aged 61 and 63 years, who were diagnosed with prostate cancer, received a transurethral marking incision of the bladder neck before starting RALP; prostate cancer developed in one patient after TUR-P and the other patient had cancer protruding into the bladder neck. A transurethral resectoscope was used to closely observe the ureteral orifices and bladder necks; the bladder necks were marked to indicate the depth from the mucosa to the muscular layer. During the RALP, the bladder necks were dissected to indicate the depth of the marking incision. The surgical margins were negative and perioperative complications did not occur. The Foley catheters were removed on postoperative day 6, according to the usual protocol. No urinary leakage from the anastomosis sites was observed.  Conclusion:   This technique, involving the use of an ordinary transurethral resectoscope, may be an easy procedure to ensure negative surgical margins, safely preserve the ureteral orifices, avoid increasing the bladder neck diameter, and achieve a good quality vesicourethral anastomosis that prevents the risk of suture-related tissue tears.""","""['Satoshi Kurokawa', 'Keiichi Tozawa', 'Yukihiro Umemoto', 'Takahiro Yasui', 'Kentaro Mizuno', 'Atsushi Okada', 'Noriyasu Kawai', 'Yutaro Hayashi', 'Kenjiro Kohri']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""BMC Urol""","""['Management of an enlarged median lobe with ureteral orifices at the margin of bladder neck during robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy.', 'Continence outcomes after bladder neck preservation during robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP).', 'An analysis of the causes of bladder neck contracture after open and robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.', 'Robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Laparascopic radical prostatectomy.']"""

The questionnaire design provides a novel approach of assessment of side effects of prostate radiotherapy, by enabling measurement of patient-perceived change in symptoms.  Material and methods:   The eight-item GISEQ was administered to 130 prostate cancer patients referred to radiotherapy. Patients completed the GISEQ at four, eight and 15 weeks after start of radiotherapy. The psychometric properties including validity, reliability, responsiveness and feasibility were evaluated. The EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-PR25 were chosen as comparative measures.  Results:   Expert opinion supported content validity. For concurrent validity, correlation between the GISEQ and matching items in the EORTC questionnaires was moderate but significant (r > 0.41, p < 0.001). The responsiveness was adequate, indicated by changes in GISEQ scores over time corresponding to the effects of radiation. Internal consistency was satisfactory (overall Cronbach's α> 0.70).

Conclusions:   The GISEQ showed satisfactory internal consistency and adequate content validity, concurrent validity and responsiveness. It is brief, easy to use and can be quickly evaluated, making it useful not only for research but possibly also for clinical settings.

Denmark introduced radical prostatectomy (RP) as the last of the Nordic countries in 1995. However, a rapid increment in the Danish incidence of PCa is indicative of a shift in attitude with increasing opportunistic PSA testing. This had led to an increasing number of RPs being performed in Denmark. The objective of this study was to analyze changes in preoperative characteristics over time for the complete cohort of 6489 men who underwent RP between 1995 and 2011. Our hypothesis was that an increasing amount of men undergo RP for lower risk PCa.  Material and methods:   All patients operated from 1995 to 2011 were identified via patient files and registries. Changes over time in age at surgery, preoperative PSA, clinical T-category, biopsy Gleason score (GS), and D'Amico classification are described. Tests for statistically significant changes were performed.  Results:   Median age increased from 61.4 to 64.8 years (p < 0.0001) during the 16-year period. Median PSA declined from 11.5 to 7.9 ng/ml (p < 0.0001). Distribution of biopsy GS changed significantly, especially after 2005. Biopsy GS = 7 was found in 20.2% of the patients in 2005 compared to 57.1% in 2011. The proportion of T1 disease increased from 32% to 56%. Significant changes in percentage of patients according to the D'Amico classification were found. After 2005 the proportion of intermediate-risk patients increased significantly. The proportion of patients age 70 or above increased from 2% to 13% in the period studies.  Conclusion:   Significant preoperative stage- and Gleason grade migration was found in this complete Danish nationwide cohort of patients undergoing RP during the past 16 years.

Discovery of tissue-specific markers may promote the development of novel targets for immunotherapy of prostate cancer. In the present study, the staining pattern and clinical significance of NGEP were evaluated in a series of prostate tissues composed of 123 prostate cancer, 19 high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and 44 samples of benign prostate tissue included in tissue microarrays using immunohistochemistry. Our study demonstrated that NGEP localized mainly in the apical and lateral membranes and was also partially distributed in the cytoplasm of epithelial cells of normal prostate tissue. All of the examined prostate tissues expressed NGEP with a variety of intensities; the level of expression was significantly more in the benign prostate tissues compared to malignant prostate samples (P value <0.001). Among prostate adenocarcinoma samples, a significant and inverse correlation was observed between the intensity of NGEP expression and increased Gleason score (P = 0.007). Taken together, we found that NGEP protein is widely expressed in low-grade to high-grade prostate adenocarcinomas as well as benign prostate tissues, and the intensity of expression is inversely proportional to the level of malignancy. NGEP could be an attractive target for immune-based therapy of prostate cancer patients as an alternative to the conventional therapies particularly in indolent patients.""","""['Monireh Mohsenzadegan', 'Zahra Madjd', 'Mojgan Asgari', 'Maryam Abolhasani', 'Mehdi Shekarabi', 'Jaleh Taeb', 'Ahmad Shariftabrizi']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Cancer Immunol Immunother""","""['NGEP, a prostate-specific plasma membrane protein that promotes the association of LNCaP cells.', 'Study of NGEP expression pattern in cancerous tissues provides novel insights into prognostic marker in prostate cancer.', 'Expression of prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA) in prostate cancer: a tissue microarray study of Iranian patients.', 'NGEP, a gene encoding a membrane protein detected only in prostate cancer and normal prostate.', 'Prostate cancer research: The next generation; report from the 2019 Coffey-Holden Prostate Cancer Academy Meeting.', 'Prostate cancer autoantibodies - applications in diagnosis, prognosis, monitoring disease progression and immunotherapy.', 'Transcripts of the Prostate Cancer-Associated Gene ANO7 Are Retained in the Nuclei of Prostatic Epithelial Cells.', 'The variant rs77559646 associated with aggressive prostate cancer disrupts ANO7 mRNA splicing and protein expression.', 'Reduced anoctamin 7 (ANO7) expression is a strong and independent predictor of poor prognosis in prostate cancer.', 'Trends in Gene Expression Profiling for Prostate Cancer Risk Assessment: A Systematic Review.']"""

Registries must achieve a high level of completeness of case ascertainment.  Aim:   Completeness of case ascertainment for the National Cancer Registry (NCR) in Ireland was estimated.  Methods:   For all invasive cancers, and the four most common sites, we used two quantitative methods which use information from death certificates to obtain estimates of completeness of registration-the Lincoln-Petersen (LP) estimator (which provides a lower bound estimate) and the flow method (which estimates completeness at a fixed time-point, in this case 5 years). Data were extracted at the end of 2010. Independent case ascertainment was used to assess completeness of breast cancer registration in the 50-64 age group and of rectal cancer in surgical patients diagnosed in 2007.  Results:   Completeness of case ascertainment was >99 % for the breast screening age-group and for surgical rectal cancer cases. A lower bound on completeness of case ascertainment for all invasive cancers excluding non-melanoma skin cancers is 94.3 % using the LP estimator. The estimate from the flow method is 97 % after 5 years, [95 % confidence interval (96.2 %, 97.7 %)]. Five-year levels of completeness for the four commonest cancers using the flow method were: colorectal, 97.4 %; lung, 98.7 %; prostate, 95.8 % and breast, 98.0 %.  Conclusion:   The estimated levels of completeness for the NCR are satisfactory.

Here we report preclinical data on BAY 1075553 (a 9:1 mixture of (2S,4S)- and (2R,4S)-2-[(18)F]fluoro-4-phosphonomethyl-pentanedioic acid), a novel (18)F-labelled small molecule inhibitor of PSMA enzymatic activity, which can be efficiently synthesized from a direct radiolabelling precursor.  Methods:   The (18)F-radiolabelled stereoisomers of 2-[(18)F]fluoro-4-(phosphonomethyl)-pentanedioic acid were synthesized from their respective isomerically pure precursors dimethyl 2-{[bis(benzyloxy)phosphoryl]methyl}-4-(tosyloxy)pentanedioate. In vivo positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and biodistribution studies were conducted in mice bearing LNCaP, 22Rv1 and PC-3 tumours. Pharmacokinetic parameters and dosimetry estimates were calculated based on biodistribution studies in rodents. For non-clinical safety assessment (safety pharmacology, toxicology) to support a single-dose human microdose study, off-target effects in vitro, effects on vital organ functions (cardiovascular in dogs, nervous system in rats), mutagenicity screens and an extended single-dose study in rats were conducted with the non-radioactive racemic analogue of BAY 1075553.  Results:   BAY 1075553 showed high tumour accumulation specific to PSMA-positive tumour-bearing mice and was superior to other stereoisomers tested. Fast clearance of BAY 1075553 resulted overall in low background signals in other organs except for high uptake into kidney and bladder which was mainly caused by renal elimination of BAY 1075553. A modest uptake into bone was observed which decreased over time indicating organ-specific uptake as opposed to defluorination of BAY 1075553 in vivo. Biodistribution studies found highest organ doses for kidneys and the urinary bladder wall resulting in a projected effective dose (ED) in humans of 0.0219 mSv/MBq. Non-clinical safety studies did not show off-target activity, effects on vital organs function or dose-dependent adverse effects.  Conclusion:   BAY 1075553 was identified as a promising PET tracer for PSMA-positive prostate tumours in preclinical studies. BAY 1075553 can be produced using a robust, direct radiosynthesis procedure.

Methods:   We applied data from the Family and Cancer Therapy Selection study, a three-wave self-administered survey among patients diagnosed with localized prostate cancer and their partner caregivers in multiple clinics in the USA. Time spent was measured by the sum of working hours lost, informal caregiving hours performed, and hours spent on household chores. The national median income for women 55 years or older was used to calculate costs associated with the time spent using the opportunity cost method.

We analyzed the specificity, selectivity and versatility of desglucoanagalloside B effects on human prostate cancer cells derived from prostate cancer metastases to brain (DU-145 cells) and bone (PC-3 cells). Prominent growth arrest and apoptotic response of both cell types was observed in the presence of sub-micromolar desglucoanagalloside B concentrations. This was accompanied by cytochrome c release and caspase 3/7 activation. A relatively low cytostatic and pro-apoptotic response of cancer cells to a desglucoanagalloside B analog, anagallosaponin IV, illustrated the specificity of the effects of desglucoanagalloside B, whereas the low sensitivity of normal prostate PNT2 cells to desglucoanagalloside B showed the selectivity of its action. Inhibition of cancer cell motility was observed in the presence of both saponins, however only desglucoanagalloside B attenuated cancer cell invasive potential, predominantly through an effect on cell elastic properties. These data demonstrate the versatility of its effects on prostate cancer cells. In contrast to PNT2 cells, cancer cells tested in this study were relatively resistant to mitoxantrone.

Radical prostatectomy has been shown to relieve lower urinary tract symptoms at short-term followup but the long-term effect of radical prostatectomy on lower urinary tract symptoms is unclear.  Materials and methods:   We performed a prospective cohort study of 1,788 men undergoing radical prostatectomy. The progression of scores from the self-administered AUASS (American Urological Association symptom score) preoperatively, and at 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 60, 84, 96 and 120 months was analyzed using models controlling for preoperative AUASS, age, prostate specific antigen, pathological Gleason score and stage, nerve sparing, race and marital status. This model was also applied to patients stratified by baseline clinically significant (AUASS greater than 7) and insignificant (AUASS 7 or less) lower urinary tract symptoms.  Results:   Men exhibited an immediate worsening of lower urinary tract symptoms that improved between 3 months and 2 years after radical prostatectomy. Overall the difference between mean AUASS at baseline and at 10 years was not statistically or clinically significant. Men with baseline clinically significant lower urinary tract symptoms experienced immediate improvements in lower urinary tract symptoms that lasted until 10 years after radical prostatectomy (13.5 vs 8.81, p <0.001). Men with baseline clinically insignificant lower urinary tract symptoms experienced a statistically significant but clinically insignificant increase in mean AUASS after 10 years (3.09 to 4.94, p <0.001). The percentage of men with clinically significant lower urinary tract symptoms decreased from baseline to 10 years after radical prostatectomy (p = 0.02).  Conclusions:   Radical prostatectomy is the only treatment for prostate cancer shown to improve and prevent the development of lower urinary tract symptoms at long-term followup.

We recently reported that the activated PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway induced by docetaxel explains resistance to docetaxel in castration resistant prostate cancer. In this study we explored the efficacy of NVP-BEZ235, a dual PI3K and mTORC1/2 inhibitor, for docetaxel resistant castration resistant prostate cancer.  Materials and methods:   We used the 2 human castration resistant prostate cancer cell lines C4-2 and C4-2AT6. At our laboratory C4-2AT6 cells were established from C4-2 under androgen ablated treatment for 6 months. We investigated the efficacy of NVP-BEZ235 monotherapy and NVP-BEZ235 combined with docetaxel in vitro and in vivo.  Results:   Increased phosphorylated Akt in C4-2AT6 cells was significantly inhibited by NVP-BEZ235 in a dose and time dependent manner. WST cell proliferation assay results in C4-2AT6 cells revealed that combined administration of NVP-BEZ235 and docetaxel had significant, synergistically greater cytotoxicity than NVP-BEZ235 or docetaxel monotherapy. Combined NVP-BEZ235 (40 mg/kg) and docetaxel (4 mg/kg) in vivo in a castrated mouse xenograft model inhibited C4-2AT6 tumor growth to a greater degree than in the monotherapy groups.

Materials and methods:   Fifteen patients with high-risk localised prostate cancer were studied. Sequential treatment was used. The initial planning target volume (PTV-L) included the prostate, seminal vesicles and pelvic lymphatics, whereas the prostate boost PTV (PTV-P) included the prostate and seminal vesicles only. The total prescription dose was 76 Gy (44 Gy to PTV-L, 32 Gy to PTV-P; 2 Gy/fraction). Two separate planning techniques were generated for each patient: seven static-field IMRT versus two-arc RapidArc. Dose-volume parameters for the organs at risk, conformity index and homogeneity index for the PTVs, the calculated monitor units and treatment delivery time for both techniques were compared.  Results:   RapidArc gave more conformal plans than IMRT for both PTVs. RapidArc gave a higher homogeneity index to the PTV-P and a similar homogeneity index to the PTV-L. The two techniques gave similar dosimetric results for the rectum, bladder and femoral heads. The mean dose (Dmean) and the maximum dose (Dmax) of the bowel space were reduced by 3.06 and 2.83%, respectively, with RapidArc. The V20 Gy, V30 Gy and V40 Gy for healthy tissues were reduced by 7.77, 14.25 and 17.55%, respectively, with RapidArc. The calculated treatment delivery time and monitor units were reduced by 74.09%/60.93% and 68.32%/48.06% for the PTV-L/PTV-P, respectively, with RapidArc.

Reliable biopsy identification of Tz tumors would allow targeted surgical approaches more likely to preserve erectile function without compromising surgical margins. Previous studies have demonstrated the presence of eosinophilic cytoplasmic granules (prostate secretory granules, or PSGs) after glutaraldehye fixation, with apparent depletion in neoplasia. We investigated PSG content, columnar cells, pale cytoplasm, and luminal secretions of both Pz and Tz tumors in 44 radical prostatectomies (RPs) and 135 biopsies fixed with gluteraldehyde-based fixative. Retention of PSG is characteristic of Tz carcinoma and infrequently seen in Pz tumors, and a combination of PSG greater than 30% with either columnar cells, pale cells, or secretions in biopsies is a reliable marker for Tz origin. When these criteria were prospectively applied to 3929 cases with follow-up RP, 510 Tz tumors were correctly identified on biopsy (sensitivity, 21.4%; specificity, 97.4%). Biopsy-identified Tz tumors had higher volumes (mean, 3.48 versus 1.81 cm(3); P < .001) and higher rates of margin positivity (22.5% versus 17.5%; P = .008) than did Tz tumors not identified preoperatively. Mean Tz tumor length in biopsies was 2.0 mm, with no correlation between tumor volume at RP and tumor length on biopsy. Tz tumors are reliably identified on biopsy, based on a combination of PSG retention with either columnar cells, pale cells, or secretion.

Objective:   To determine whether detecting enhanced transcripts for PCa in whole blood using an analytically valid assay has prognostic significance relative to circulating tumor cell (CTC) enumeration.  Design, setting, and participants:   The detection of KLK3, KLK2, HOXB13, GRHL2, and FOXA1 in whole blood by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was studied in 97 men with metastatic castration-resistant PCa (mCRPC) as a prognostic factor for overall survival.  Intervention:   The 2.5 ml of blood was collected in PAXgene tubes for total RNA extraction and 7.5 ml for CTC enumeration from patients with progressive mCRPC.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   PCa-enriched genes were detected using a sensitive RT-PCR assay in whole blood from patients with mCRPC. Analytical validity of the assay was established in a clinical laboratory environment. The frequency of detecting transcripts was compared to CTC enumeration using CellSearch in an independent data set and survival associations were explored by concordance probability estimate (CPE).  Results and limitations:   Two or more genes were detected by PCR in 53% of patients (51 of 97; 95% confidence interval [CI], 43-63%), and unfavorable CTC counts (five of more cells) were seen in 46% (45 of 97; 95% CI, 36-56%). Importantly, transcripts were detectable in 11 of 52 patients with favorable CTC counts (21%; 95% CI, 8-35%). Transcript detection predicted overall survival in a proportional hazards model. Significantly, the predictive accuracy of RT-PCR detection in combination with CTC enumeration had a CPE of 0.752 (standard error: 0.038), although this was limited by the number of patients evaluated.  Conclusions:   This validated RT-PCR assay detecting prostate-specific RNA in whole blood is prognostic for survival and may assess patient risk in tandem with CellSearch CTC enumeration.

The effect of screening for individuals, however, is diluted by nonattendance and contamination in the trial arms.  Objective:   To determine the prostate cancer (PCa) mortality reduction from screening after adjustment for nonattendance and contamination.  Design, setting, and participants:   A total of 34,833 men in the core age group, 55-69 yr, were randomized to a screening or control arm in the Rotterdam section of the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC). Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing was offered to all men in the screening arm at 4-yr intervals. A prostate biopsy was offered to men with an elevated PSA. The primary end point was PCa-specific mortality.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Nonattendance was defined as nonparticipation in the screening arm. Contamination in the control arm was defined as receiving asymptomatic PSA testing or a prostate biopsy in the absence of symptoms. Relative risks (RRs) were calculated with an intention to screen (ITS) analysis and after correction for nonattendance and contamination using a method that preserves the benefits obtained by randomization.  Results and limitations:   The ITS analysis resulted in an RR of 0.68 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.53-0.89) in favor of screening at a median follow-up of 13 yr. Correction for both nonattendance and contamination resulted in an RR of 0.49 (95% CI, 0.27-0.87) in favor of screening.  Conclusions:   PCa screening as conducted in the Rotterdam section of the ERSPC can reduce the risk of dying from PCa up to 51% for an individual man choosing to be screened repeatedly compared with a man who was not screened. This benefit of screening should be balanced against the harms of overdiagnosis and subsequent overtreatment.

Objective:   To evaluate the pathologic outcomes of patients who underwent RP following initial AS.  Design, setting, and participants:   We analyzed the records of 67 patients who underwent RP following initial AS begun between 1993 and 2011. All patients underwent confirmatory biopsy to reassess eligibility for AS. RP was recommended for disease progression suggested by follow-up biopsies or imaging.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Unfavorable disease was defined as having at least one of the following pathologic findings: Gleason score (GS) ≥4+3, extracapsular extension of tumor, seminal vesicle invasion, or lymph node involvement. A descriptive analysis was performed to assess pathologic features.  Results and limitations:   Median time from confirmatory biopsy to RP was 1.7 yr (range: 0.3-7.8). Reasons for discontinuing AS to undergo RP included evidence of increased tumor volume or grade on follow-up biopsy, patient preference/anxiety, and findings on follow-up imaging in 46 patients (68.7%), 17 patients (25.3%), and 4 patients (6.0%), respectively. Pathologic analyses revealed organ-confined disease in 55 patients (82.1%), and GS was ≥4+3 in 9 (13.4%). Positive nodes were observed in three patients (4.4%) and positive surgical margin in two (3.0%). Overall, 19 patients (28.4%) had unfavorable disease. Of the biopsy criteria for triggering RP, Gleason patterns >3 were the most frequently associated with unfavorable disease (43.3%). One patient (1.5%) experienced biochemical recurrence during postoperative follow-up (median: 3.2 yr). Our study may be limited by its retrospective and single-institution nature.

Methods and materials:   Data for first 1006 consecutive LDR-PB implants (1998-2003) were extracted from a prospective database. Patients had low- (58%) or intermediate (42%)-risk disease. Three months neoadjuvant and 3 months concomitant androgen deprivation therapy were used in 65% of cases. The Phoenix definition was modified to ""unfail"" patients who had a benign prostate-specific antigen (PSA) bounce.  Results:   The median followup is 7.5 years. The median PSA at latest followup for disease-free patients was 0.04 ng/mL. The Phoenix definition yielded 5- and 10-year Kaplan-Meier DFS estimates of 96.5 ± 1.2% and 93.7 ± 2.0%, respectively.

There is widespread geographical variation in the quality of care. Few data are available on national screening rates in South Africa and how these vary across the provinces.  Objective:   To examine screening rates for chronic diseases of lifestyle (CDL), HIV and cancer in a privately insured population for a single insurer across all nine provinces in South Africa, and to determine whether or not there are any differences between the provinces.  Method:   Screening rates were calculated as the proportion of eligible members who had received screening tests during 2011 in each province. Mean screening rates were compared between Gauteng and the other eight provinces.  Results:   Nationwide screening rates were 20.5% for CDL, 8.2% for HIV and 31.9% for cancer. Despite similar insurance coverage, screening rates ranged from 0.3% to 0.95% lower in other provinces compared with Gauteng. Of all the provinces, Gauteng had the highestannual screening rates for CDL, breast cancer, prostate cancer and HIV (p < 0.001), while the Western Cape had the highest rate for cervical cancer (p < 0.001).  Conclusion:   There is much variation in preventive care utilisation across the provinces within this health-insured population. Provinces with more abundant healthcare resources have higher screening rates. Further research is required to understand the reasons for the variation, given equal payment access.""","""['L Adonis', 'R An', 'J Luiz', 'A Mehrotra', 'D Patel', 'D Basu', 'R Sturm']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""S Afr Med J""","""['Screening for chronic diseases in South Africa.', 'Predictors of adherence to screening guidelines for chronic diseases of lifestyle, cancers, and HIV in a health-insured population in South Africa.', 'Screening for chronic diseases in South Africa.', 'The South African HIV epidemic, reflected by nine provincial epidemics, 1990-1996.', 'Predictors of screening for breast, cervical, colorectal, and prostatic cancer among community-based primary care practices.', 'Care of Patients With HIV Infection: Primary Care.', 'Use of Machine Learning and Statistical Algorithms to Predict Hospital Length of Stay Following Colorectal Cancer Resection: A South African Pilot Study.', 'Progress towards the 2020 targets for HIV diagnosis and antiretroviral treatment in South Africa.', 'Cervical cancer prevention and treatment research in Africa: a systematic review from a public health perspective.', 'Health care access dimensions and cervical cancer screening in South Africa: analysis of the world health survey.', 'Predictors of adherence to screening guidelines for chronic diseases of lifestyle, cancers, and HIV in a health-insured population in South Africa.']"""

However, the existence of cells with high ALDH activity (ALDH(bright)) in primary prostate cancer specimens has not been shown so far. We investigated the presence, phenotype, and clinical significance of ALDH(bright) populations in clinical prostate cancer specimens.  Experimental design:   We used ALDEFLUOR technology and fluorescence-activated cell-sorting (FACS) staining to identify and characterize ALDH(bright) populations in cells freshly isolated from clinical prostate cancer specimens. Expression of genes encoding ALDH-specific isoforms was evaluated by quantitative real-time PCR in normal prostate, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and prostate cancer tissues. ALDH1A1-specific expression and prognostic significance were assessed by staining two tissue microarrays that included more than 500 samples of BPH, prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN), and multistage prostate cancer.  Results:   ALDH(bright) cells were detectable in freshly excised prostate cancer specimens (n = 39) and were mainly included within the EpCAM((+)) and Trop2((+)) cell populations. Although several ALDH isoforms were expressed to high extents in prostate cancer, only ALDH1A1 gene expression significantly correlated with ALDH activity (P < 0.01) and was increased in cancers with high Gleason scores (P = 0.03). Most importantly, ALDH1A1 protein was expressed significantly more frequently and at higher levels in advanced-stage than in low-stage prostate cancer and BPH. Notably, ALDH1A1 positivity was associated with poor survival (P = 0.02) in hormone-naïve patients.

Here we aimed to determine whether P2Y2, one subtype of P2Y receptors, was involved in the invasion and metastasis of prostate cancer cells, and elucidated the underlying mechanism.  Methods:   RNAi was introduced to silence the expression of P2Y2. In vitro invasion and migration assays and in vivo experiments were carried out to examine the role of P2Y2 receptor in cell invasion and metastasis. cDNA microarray was performed to identify the differentially expressed genes downstream of ATP treatment.  Results:   P2Y2 was significantly expressed in the prostate cancer cells. Knockdown of P2Y2 receptor suppressed cell invasion and metastasis in vitro and in vivo. Further experiments identified that ATP could promote IL-8 and Snail expression and inhibit E-cadherin and Claudin-1 expression. Knockdown of P2Y2 receptor affected the expression of these EMT/invasion-related genes in vitro and in vivo.

GRP receptors are overexpressed in a variety of human cancers including prostate cancer. Radiolabeled BBN derivatives are promising diagnostic probes for molecular imaging of GRP receptor-expressing prostate cancer. This study describes the synthesis and radiopharmacological evaluation of various metabolically stabilized fluorobenzoylated bombesin analogues (BBN-1, BBN-2, BBN-3).  Methods:   Three fluorobenzoylated BBN analogues containing an aminovaleric (BBN-1, BBN-2), or an aminooctanoic acid linker (BBN-3) were tested in a competitive binding assay against (125)I-[Tyr(4)]-BBN for their binding potency to the GRP receptor. Intracellular calcium release in human prostate cancer cells (PC3) was measured to determine agonistic or antagonistic profiles of fluorobenzoylated BBN derivatives. Bombesin derivative BBN-2 displayed the highest inhibitory potency toward GRP receptor (IC50 = 8.7 ± 2.2 nM) and was subsequently selected for radiolabeling with fluorine-18 ((18)F) through acylation with N-succinimidyl-4-[(18)F]fluorobenzoate ([(18)F]SFB). The radiopharmacological profile of (18)F-labeled bombesin [(18)F]BBN-2 was evaluated in PC3 tumor-bearing NMRI nude mice involving metabolic stability studies, biodistribution experiments and dynamic small-animal PET studies.  Results:   All fluorobenzoylated BBN derivatives displayed high inhibitory potency toward the GRP receptor (IC50=8.7-16.7 nM), and all compounds exhibited antagonistic profiles as determined in an intracellular calcium release assay. The (18)F-labeled BBN analogue [(18)F]BBN-2 was obtained in 30% decay-corrected radiochemical yield with high radiochemical purity >95% after semi-preparative HPLC purification. [(18)F]BBN-2 showed high metabolic stability in vivo with 65% of the radiolabeled peptide remaining intact after 60 min p.i. in mouse plasma. Biodistribution experiments and dynamic small-animal PET studies demonstrated high tumor uptake of [(18)F]BBN-2 in PC3 xenografts (2.75 ± 1.82 %ID/g after 5 min and 2.45 ± 1.25 %ID/g after 60 min p.i.). Specificity of radiotracer uptake in PC3 tumors was confirmed by blocking experiments.  Conclusion:   The present study demonstrates that (18)F-labeled BBN analogue [(18)F]BBN-2 is a suitable PET radiotracer with favorable metabolic stability in vivo for molecular imaging of GRP receptor-positive prostate cancer.""","""['Susan Richter', 'Melinda Wuest', 'Stephanie S Krieger', 'Buck E Rogers', 'Matthias Friebe', 'Ralf Bergmann', 'Frank Wuest']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Nucl Med Biol""","""['18F-labeled bombesin analogs for targeting GRP receptor-expressing prostate cancer.', 'microPET and autoradiographic imaging of GRP receptor expression with 64Cu-DOTA-Lys3bombesin in human prostate adenocarcinoma xenografts.', 'PET of tumors expressing gastrin-releasing peptide receptor with an 18F-labeled bombesin analog.', 'Nuclear imaging of prostate cancer with gastrin-releasing-peptide-receptor targeted radiopharmaceuticals.', '111In-DOTA-Aminohexanoyl-D-Phe6,Leu-NHCH2CH2CH313,desMet14 BBN6-14.', 'GMP-compliant production of 68GaGa-NeoB for positron emission tomography imaging of patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumor.', 'Gastrin-releasing peptide receptor-targeted gadolinium oxide-based multifunctional nanoparticles for dual magnetic resonance/fluorescent molecular imaging of prostate cancer.', 'A human GRPr-transfected Ace-1 canine prostate cancer model in mice.', 'Comparison of (11)CCholine ((11)CCHO) and (18)FBombesin (BAY 86-4367) as Imaging Probes for Prostate Cancer in a PC-3 Prostate Cancer Xenograft Model.', 'Positron-emission tomography in urooncology.']"""

Several clinical studies in cancer patients have shown that the elevated levels of survivin correlate with aggressiveness of the disease and resistance to radiation and chemotherapeutic treatments. Survivin is an integral component of chromosomal passenger complex (CPC) where it binds to borealin and INCENP through its dimerization interface. Thus, disruption of functional survivin along its dimer interface with a small molecule is hypothesized to inhibit the proliferation of cancer cells and sensitize them to therapeutic agents and radiation. Recently, a small molecule (Abbott8) was reported to bind at the dimerization interface of survivin. Further development of this compound was accomplished by computational modeling of the molecular interactions along the dimerization interface, which has led to the design of promising survivin dimerization modulators.

Cellular uptake of NPs was then evaluated in PCa cell lines DU-145, PC-3, and LNCaP using confocal fluorescence microscopy, and antiproliferative efficacy was assessed using MTT assay. With encapsulation efficiencies ranging from 74% to 98%, RSV was successfully loaded in PCL:PLGA-PEG-COOH NPs, which showed an average diameter of 150 nm. NPs were able to control the RSV release at pH 6.5 and 7.4, mimicking the acidic tumoral microenvironment and physiological conditions, respectively, with only 55% of RSV released within 7 h. In gastrointestinal simulated fluids, NPs released about 55% of RSV in the first 2 h in acidic medium, and their total RSV content within the subsequent 5 h at pH 7.4. Confocal fluorescence microscopy observations revealed that NPs were efficiently taken up by PCa cell lines. Furthermore, nano-RSV significantly improved the cytotoxicity compared to that of free RSV toward all three cell lines, at all tested concentrations (from 10 μM to 40 μM), proving a consistent sensitivity toward both the androgen-independent DU-145 and hormone-sensitive LNCaP cells.

There is a growing interest in extending care pathways into primary care. There is little evidence on the relationship between care pathways across the primary-hospital care continuum and improvement in quality of care. Members of primary and hospital care services in the region of Bruges (Belgium) developed a care pathway for radical prostatectomy patients. An evaluation of this care pathway encountered some problems.  Aim:   To assess if a revision of the care pathway would improve quality of care enhancing patient outcomes.  Methods:   An exploratory trial was performed to test the feasibility of quality measurement, the possible intervention effect and recruitment. A pre-post-intervention postal survey was used. Quality of care was translated into process and outcome indicators. These indicators were measured in two groups receiving a postal questionnaire: one group before (pre-intervention) and another group after implementation (post-intervention). A Fisher's exact test was used to compare differences for dichotomous variables, and a Mann-Whitney U-test to compare ordinal and continuous variables.  Results:   Observed improvements in process and outcome indicators were not statistically significant after correcting for multiple testing: 95.1% of patients received the information pack during the pre-operative consultation (versus 81.0% in the pre-intervention), 86.0% of the patients consulted a physiotherapist who specialised in pelvic floor muscle exercise treatment (versus 56.0% in the pre-intervention) and no patients experienced pain (versus 13.6% in the pre-intervention). No changes were observed for communication and co-ordination between caregivers.

Understanding how that process is regulated is therefore critical. We previously demonstrated that endoglin, a type III transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) superfamily receptor, suppresses human PCa cell invasion and metastasis. Endoglin-mediated suppression of invasion was also shown by us to be dependent upon the type I TGFβ receptor, activin receptor-like kinase 2 (ALK2), and the downstream effector, Smad1. In this study we demonstrate for the first time that two type II TGFβ receptors are required for endoglin-mediated suppression of invasion: activin A receptor type IIA (ActRIIA) and bone morphogenetic protein receptor type II (BMPRII). Downstream signaling through these receptors is predominantly mediated by Smad1. ActRIIA stimulates Smad1 activation in a kinase-dependent manner, and this is required for suppression of invasion. In contrast BMPRII regulates Smad1 in a biphasic manner, promoting Smad1 signaling through its kinase domain but suppressing it through its cytoplasmic tail. BMPRII's Smad1-regulatory effects are dependent upon its expression level. Further, its ability to suppress invasion is independent of either kinase function or tail domain. We demonstrate that ActRIIA and BMPRII physically interact, and that each also interacts with endoglin. The current findings demonstrate that both BMPRII and ActRIIA are necessary for endoglin-mediated suppression of human PCa cell invasion, that they have differential effects on Smad1 signaling, that they make separate contributions to regulation of invasion, and that they functionally and physically interact.""","""['Michael J Breen', 'Diarmuid M Moran', 'Wenzhe Liu', 'Xiaoke Huang', 'Calvin P H Vary', 'Raymond C Bergan']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Endoglin suppresses human prostate cancer metastasis.', 'Endoglin inhibits prostate cancer motility via activation of the ALK2-Smad1 pathway.', 'Rapid Activation of Bone Morphogenic Protein 9 by Receptor-mediated Displacement of Pro-domains.', 'Bone morphogenetic proteins.', 'Signal transduction pathway through activin receptors as a therapeutic target of musculoskeletal diseases and cancer.', 'Endoglin in the Spotlight to Treat Cancer.', 'Genistein treatment duration effects biomarkers of cell motility in human prostate.', 'CFTR dysfunction increases endoglin and TGF-β signaling in airway epithelia.', 'Precision therapeutic targeting of human cancer cell motility.', 'Cancer incidence in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia.']"""

It has been well established that the increased acidity will induce cell death of normal cells but not cancer cells. The main question we address here is: how cancer cells deal with the increased acidity to avoid the activation of apoptosis. We have carried out a comparative analysis of transcriptomic data of six solid cancer types, breast, colon, liver, two lung (adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma) and prostate cancers, and proposed a model of how cancer cells utilize a few mechanisms to keep the protons outside of the cells. The model consists of a number of previously, well or partially, studied mechanisms for transporting out the excess protons, such as through the monocarboxylate transporters, V-ATPases, NHEs and the one facilitated by carbonic anhydrases. In addition we propose a new mechanism that neutralizes protons through the conversion of glutamate to γ-aminobutyrate, which consumes one proton per reaction.

Mechanistically, we found that single agent AZD5363 induces increase of AR binding to androgen response element, AR transcriptional activity, and AR-dependent genes such as PSA and NKX3.1 expression.

Compared with other metastatic cancer cells tested, RCC and STS cells exhibited increased levels of expression of fibronectin and an activated form of the integrin αvβ3, which coordinately supported the generation of an elaborate fibronectin matrix and actin stress fibers in fibrin-embedded tumor cells. Together, fibronectin and αvβ3 induced upregulation of the transcription factor Slug, which mediates epithelial-mesenchymal transition as well as fibrin invasion and lung metastasis. This mechanism is clinically significant, because primary cancer cells from patients with metastatic RCC strongly invaded fibrin and this correlated with fibronectin matrix formation and Slug expression. In contrast, tumor cells from patients with localized RCC were largely noninvasive.

The present study examined the anti-cancer effect of fucoidan obtained from Undaria pinnatifida in PC-3 cells, human prostate cancer cells. Fucoidan induced the apoptosis of PC-3 cells by activating both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways. The induction of apoptosis was accompanied by the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK1/2 MAPK) and the inactivation of p38 MAPK and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt. In addition, fucoidan also induced the up-regulation of p21Cip1/Waf and down-regulation of E2F-1 cell-cycle-related proteins. Furthermore, in the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, fucoidan activated GSK-3β that resulted in the decrease of β-catenin level, followed by the decrease of c-myc and cyclin D1 expressions, target genes of β-catenin in PC-3 cells. These results suggested that fucoidan treatment could induce intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis pathways via the activation of ERK1/2 MAPK, the inactivation of p38 MAPK and PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, and the down-regulation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in PC-3 prostate cancer cells.

The likelihood that a hospital would acquire a robotic facility and the rates of radical prostatectomy relative to the prevalence of robots in geographic market areas were assessed using multivariable analysis.  Results:   Hospitals in areas where a higher proportion of other hospitals had already acquired a robot were more likely to acquire one (P=0.012), as were those with more than 300 beds (P<0.0001) and teaching hospitals (P<0.0001). There was a significant association between years with a robot and the change in the number of radical prostatectomies (P<0.0001). More radical prostatectomies were performed in areas where the number of robots per 100,000 men was higher (P<0.0001). Adding a single robot per 100,000 men in an area was associated with a 30% increase in the rate of radical prostatectomies.

Simulations of target shapes from each PCA-model were used to calculate iso-coverage levels, which were converted to contours. The levels were analyzed for sensitivity and precision.  Results:   A union of the simulated shapes was able to cover at least 97%, 97% and 95% of the volumes of the evaluated CTV shapes for PCA-models using six, five and four DVFs as input, respectively.

Septins are a highly conserved family of GTP-binding cytoskeletal proteins. Mammalian septins are involved in diverse cellular processes including tumorigenesis. We have been studying the interaction between septin 9 isoform 1 (SEPT9_i1) and hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), the oxygen regulated subunit of HIF-1. HIF-1 is a key transcription factor in the hypoxic responses pathway, and its activation has been observed in carcinogenesis and numerous cancers. SEPT9_i1/HIF-1α interaction plays an important role in upregulation of HIF-1 transcriptional activity by preventing HIF-1α's ubiquitination and degradation leading to increased tumor growth and angiogenesis. We tested the hypothesis whether FCF affects SEPT9_i1 filamentous structures and consequently HIF-1 pathway in cancer cells. We showed that FCF suppresses tumorigenic properties, including proliferation, migration and transformation, in prostate cancer cells. FCF did not alter SEPT9_i1 steady state protein expression levels but it affected its filamentous structures and subcellular localization. FCF induced degradation of HIF-1α protein in a dose- and time-dependent manner. This inhibition was also shown in other common cancer types tested. Rapid degradation of HIF-1α protein levels was accompanied by respective inhibition in HIF-1α transcriptional activity. Moreover, HIF-1α protein half-life was markedly decreased in the presence of FCF compared with that in the absence of FCF. The FCF-induced degradation of HIF-1α was mediated in a significant part via the proteasome. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of specific manipulation of septin filaments by pharmacological means having downstream inhibitory effects on the HIF-1 pathway.""","""['Dikla Vardi-Oknin', 'Maya Golan', 'Nicola J Mabjeesh']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['SEPT9_i1 is required for the association between HIF-1α and importin-α to promote efficient nuclear translocation.', 'Targeted knockdown of SEPT9_v1 inhibits tumor growth and angiogenesis of human prostate cancer cells concomitant with disruption of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 pathway.', 'Imaging of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α and septin 9 interaction by bimolecular fluorescence complementation in live cancer cells.', 'HIF-1alpha modulates energy metabolism in cancer cells by inducing over-expression of specific glycolytic isoforms.', 'Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1)alpha: its protein stability and biological functions.', 'Contribution of septins to human platelet structure and function.', 'Forchlorfenuron and Novel Analogs Cause Cytotoxic Effects in Untreated and Cisplatin-Resistant Malignant Mesothelioma-Derived Cells.', 'Septins in Infections: Focus on Viruses.', 'Development of Potent Forchlorfenuron Analogs and Their Cytotoxic Effect in Cancer Cell Lines.', 'A Septin Cytoskeleton-Targeting Small Molecule, Forchlorfenuron, Inhibits Epithelial Migration via Septin-Independent Perturbation of Cellular Signaling.']"""

The data on prostate cancer is conflicting and reports on long-term cancer specific survival are lacking.  Methods:   In a retrospective, single-center study, outcomes of 148 consecutive patients with locally advanced prostate cancer pT3/4 who underwent retropubic radical prostatectomy (RRP) with general anesthesia combined with intra- and postoperative epidural analgesia (n=67) or with postoperative ketorolac-morphine analgesia (n=81) were reviewed. The median observation time was 14.00 years (range 10.87-17.75 yrs). Biochemical recurrence (BCR)-free, local and distant recurrence-free, cancer-specific, and overall survival were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier technique. Multivariate Cox proportional-hazards regression models were used to analyze clinicopathologic variables associated with disease progression and death.  Results:   The survival estimates for BCR-free, local and distant recurrence-free, cancer-specific survival and overall survival did not differ between the two groups (P=0.64, P=0.75, P=0.18, P=0.32 and P=0.07).

Previous work with functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated altered prefrontal cortical activations in cognitive control, with undetectable changes in behavioral performance. Given the utility of brain imaging in identifying the potentially deleterious effects of ADT on brain functions, the current study examined the effects of ADT on cerebral structures using high resolution MRI and voxel-based morphometry (VBM).  Methods:   High resolution T1 weighted image of the whole brain were acquired at baseline and six months after ADT for 12 prostate cancer patients and 12 demographically matched non-exposed control participants imaged at the same time points. Brain images were segmented into gray matter, white matter and cerebral ventricles using the VBM toolbox as implemented in Statistical Parametric Mapping 8.  Results:   Compared to baseline scan, prostate cancer patients undergoing ADT showed decreased gray matter volume in frontopolar cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and primary motor cortex, whereas the non-exposed control participants did not show such changes. In addition, the decrease in gray matter volume of the primary motor cortex showed a significant correlation with longer reaction time to target detection in a working memory task.  Conclusions:   ADT can affect cerebral gray matter volumes in prostate cancer patients.

Since the subcellular localization of UBIAD1 varies in different cell types, characterization of the exact subcellular localization of UBIAD1 in specific human disease is vital for understanding its molecular mechanism. As UBIAD1 suppresses bladder carcinoma, we studied its subcellular localization in human bladder carcinoma cell line T24. Since fluorescent images of UBIAD1-EGFP in T24, human prostate cancer cell line PC-3, human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293 and human hepatocyte cell line L02 are similar, these four cell lines were used for present study. Using a combination of fluorescent microscopy and immunohistochemistry, it was found that UBIAD1 localized on the Golgi and endoplasmic reticulum (ER), but not on the plasma membrane, of T24 and HEK293 cells. Using scanning electron microscopy and western blot analysis, we found that UBIAD1 is enriched in the Golgi fraction extracted from the L02 cells, verifying the Golgi localization of UBAID1. Site-directed mutagenesis showed that the RPWS motif, which forms an Arginine finger on the UBIAD1 N terminus, serves as the Golgi retention signal. With both cycloheximide and brefeldin A inhibition assays, it was shown that UBIAD1 may be transported from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi by a COPII-mediated mechanism. Based upon flow cytometry analysis, it is shown that mutation of the RPWS motif reduced the UBIAD1-induced apoptosis of T24 cells, indicating that the proper Golgi localization of UBIAD1 influences its tumor suppressant activity.

A specific set of mRNAs as internal control reference genes is considered as the preferred strategy to normalize RT-qPCR data. Proper selection of reference genes is a critical issue, especially in cancer cells that are subjected to different in vitro manipulations. These manipulations may result in dramatic alterations in gene expression levels, even of assumed reference genes. In this study, we evaluated the expression levels of 11 commonly used reference genes as internal controls for normalization of 19 experiments that include neuroblastoma, T-ALL, melanoma, breast cancer, non small cell lung cancer (NSCL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), prostate cancer, colorectal cancer, and cervical cancer cell lines subjected to various perturbations.  Results:   The geNorm algorithm in the software package qbase+ was used to rank the candidate reference genes according to their expression stability. We observed that the stability of most of the candidate reference genes varies greatly in perturbation experiments. Expressed Alu repeats show relatively stable expression regardless of experimental condition.

WISP1 was also elevated in the mouse prostate cancer model TRAMP in the hypoplastic diseased tissue that develops prior to advanced carcinoma formation. When the ability of anti-WISP1 antibodies to reduce the spread of PC3-Luc cells to distant sites was tested it showed that twice weekly injections of anti-WISP1 antibodies reduced the number and overall size of distant tumors developed after intracardiac (IC) injection of PC3-Luc cells in mice. The ability of antibodies against WISP1 to inhibit growth of PC3-Luc cancer cells in mice was also evaluated and showed that twice weekly injections of anti-WISP1 antibodies reduced local tumor growth when examined in xenografts. To better understand the mechanism of action, the migration of PC3-Luc cells through membranes with or without a Matrigel™ barrier showed the cells were attracted to WISP1, and that this attraction was inhibited by treatment with anti-WISP1 antibodies. We also show the expression of WISP1 at the bone-tumor interface and in the stroma of early grade cancers suggested WISP1 expression is well placed to play roles in both fostering growth of the cancer and its spread to bone.

However, the molecular phenotype of the recruited MSCs at the tumor microenvironment and the genetic programs underlying their role in cancer progression remains largely unknown. By using a three-dimensional rotary wall vessel coculture system in which human MSCs were grown alone or in close contact with LNCaP, C4-2 or PC3 prostate cancer cell lines, we established in vitro matched pairs of normal and cancer-associated MSC derivatives to study the stromal response of MSCs to prostate cancer. We observed that prostate cancer-associated MSCs acquired a higher potential for adipogenic differentiation and exhibited a stronger ability to promote prostate cancer cell migration and invasion compared with normal MSCs both in vitro and in experimental animal models. The enhanced adipogenesis and the pro-metastatic properties were conferred by the high levels of IL-6 secretion by cancer-associated MSCs and were reversible by functionally inhibiting of IL-6. We also found that IL-6 is a direct target gene for the let-7 microRNA, which was downregulated in cancer-associated MSCs. The overexpression of let-7 via the transfection of let-7 precursors decreased IL-6 expression and repressed the adipogenic potential and metastasis-promoting activity of cancer-associated MSCs, which was consistent with the inhibition of IL-6 3'UTR luciferase activity. Conversely, the treatment of normal MSCs with let-7 inhibitors resulted in effects similar to those seen with IL-6. Taken together, our data demonstrated that MSCs co-evolve with prostate cancer cells in the tumor microenvironment, and the downregulation of let-7 by cancer-associated MSCs upregulates IL-6 expression. This upregulation triggers adipogenesis and facilitates prostate cancer progression.

Methods:   A population-based, community-dwelling, geographically diverse sample of long-term (2-13 years) PC survivors in Ontario, Canada, was identified from the Ontario Cancer Registry and contacted through their referring physicians. We obtained data on demographics, health care resource use, and OOP costs through mailed questionnaires and conducted chart reviews to obtain clinical data. We compared mean annual time and OOP costs (2006 Canadian dollars) across clinical and sociodemographic characteristics and examined the association between costs and four groups of predictors (patient, disease, system, symptom) using two-part regression models.  Results:   Patients' (N = 585) mean age was 73 years; 77 % were retired, and 42 % reported total annual incomes less than $40,000. Overall, mean time costs were $838/year and mean OOP costs were $200/year. Although generally low, total costs represented approximately 10 % of income for lower income patients. No demographic variables were associated with costs. Radical prostatectomy, younger age, poor urinary function, current androgen deprivation therapy, and recent diagnosis were significantly associated with increased likelihood of incurring any costs, but only urinary function significantly affected total amount.  Conclusions:   Time and OOP costs are modest for most long-term PC survivors but can represent a substantial burden for lower income patients. Even several years after diagnosis, PC-specific treatments and treatment-related dysfunction are associated with increased costs.  Implications for cancer survivors:   Time and out-of-pocket costs are generally manageable for long-term PC survivors but can be a significant burden mainly for lower income patients.

The questionnaire was sent to 895 eligible survivors who assessed symptom occurrence and QoL in the previous 6 months.  Results:   We received a filled-in questionnaire from 874 (89 %) men. For the long-term gastrointestinal symptoms, 11/13 were associated with the perception of fecal body odor. For the long-term urinary symptoms, 11/11 were associated with the perception of urine body odor. Men who perceived fecal or urine body odor had a lower quality of life, a lower physical health, and more frequent feelings of depression compared with those who did perceive such body odor.  Conclusion:   Long-term gastrointestinal and urinary symptoms after prostate irradiation are associated with the perception of fecal or urine body odor leading to a reduced quality of life.  Implications for cancer survivors:   Disabling body odor after pelvic irradiation needs to be acknowledged in the clinic. Interventions to prevent long-term symptoms may serve the benefit of avoiding fecal or urine body odor after radiation therapy for prostate cancer.""","""['D Alsadius', 'C Olsson', 'N Pettersson', 'S L Tucker', 'U Wilderäng', 'G Steineck']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Cancer Surviv""","""['Partnership status affects the association between gastrointestinal symptoms and quality of life after radiation therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Patient-reported gastrointestinal symptoms among long-term survivors after radiation therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Prospective evaluation of quality of life 54 months after high-dose intensity-modulated radiotherapy for localized prostate cancer.', 'Quality of life after radiotherapy for prostate cancer.', 'Quality of life study in prostate cancer patients treated with three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy: comparing late bowel and bladder quality of life symptoms to that of the normal population.', 'A Preparatory Study for a Randomized Controlled Trial of Dietary Fiber Intake During Adult Pelvic Radiotherapy.', 'Identifying classes of the pain, fatigue, and depression symptom cluster in long-term prostate cancer survivors-results from the multi-regional Prostate Cancer Survivorship Study in Switzerland (PROCAS).']"""

Purpose:   We examined the effects of ambient ultraviolet-B radiation (UVB) at time of diagnosis, season of diagnosis and latitude of residence on survival outcome from prostate cancer.  Method:   Regression models for relative survival were used to estimate relative excess risks (RER) of death after diagnosis of prostate cancer from cancer registries in Eastern Australia (Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania).  Results:   Relative excess risks was increased with diagnosis in summer (RER = 1.20; 95 % CI 1.14-1.26) relative to winter, high ambient UVB at the time of diagnosis (>60 mW/m(2); RER = 1.10; 95 % CI 1.05-1.15) relative to low SUV (<30 mW/m(2)), and with residence in high latitudes (35°S-43°S; RER = 1.20; 95 % CI 1.14-1.26) relative to low latitudes (9°S-29.9°S). RER was highest for summer diagnosis in all three latitude bands, after adjusting for age, follow-up period, and socioeconomic status.

Astrocyte elevated gene-1(AEG-1) as a novel transmembrane protein is predominantly located in the perinuclear region and endoplasmic reticulum. It has been found that AEG-1 upregulation increases the invasive ability of glioma and prostate cancer. Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), cyclooxygenases-2 (COX-2), and adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) are very important in tumor progression as well.  Materials and methods:   This study included 97 radical prostatectomy specimens. IHC stains for bFGF, MMP-9, COX-2, APC, and AEG-1 were performed on the tissue microarray using standard procedures. For each patient, the age, Gleason score, tumor volume, lymphovascular invasion, lymph node metastasis, surgical margin, and the invasion of vesiculoseminalis areas were assessed. Analyses were performed using the statistical PASW (ver. 18).  Results:   Statistically significant positive relationships were found MMP-9 and COX-2 (r = 0.242 and P = 0.017), between MMP-9 and APC (r = 0.207 and P = 0.043), and between bFGF and AEG-1 (r = 0.295 and P = 0.004). However, the relationships between age and staining results and tumor volume and staining results were not found to be significant. Although a positive correlation was found between the Gleason score and tumor volume and the Gleason score and age (r = 0.415 and P = 0.0001; r = 0.246 and P = 0.015, respectively), we did not find a statistically significant relationship between other stains and other prognostic parameters (lymphovascular invasion, lymph node metastasis, surgical margin, or vesiculoseminalis invasion).

In the 308 evaluable patients (211 with breast cancer, 97 with prostate cancer), clinical follow-up was used as the gold standard. Bone metastases were confirmed in 72 patients and excluded in 236. Multistep analyses per lesion and per patient were performed. Clinical relevance was expressed in terms of downstaging and upstaging rates on a per-patient basis.  Results:   In the total patient group, sensitivities, specificities, and negative and positive predictive values on a per-patient basis were 93 %, 78 %, 95 % and 59 % for WBS, 94 %, 71 %, 97 % and 53 % for SPECT, and 97 %, 94 %, 97 % and 88 % for SPECT/CT, respectively.

In the present study, we demonstrated that the growth inhibitory effect of let-7a1 is directly related to targeting IGF1R gene expression in PC-3 cells. TargetScan predicted three potential target sites (T1, T2 and T3) of let-7a in the 3' untranslational region (3' UTR) of IGF1R mRNA. Real-time PCR, Western blot and luciferase reporter assays were used to detect the effects of let-7a1 overexpression or let-7a1 inhibitor on the IGF1R gene expression in PC-3 cells. The results indicated that let-7a1 could inhibit IGF1R expression by directly targeting the T1 and T2 sites in the 3' UTR of the IGF1R mRNA. We then used RT-PCR, luciferase reporter assays, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5- diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, flow cytometry and Hoechst 33342 staining to examine whether let-7a1-mediated inhibition of IGF1R expression also affects the IGF1R-mediated signalling events, including Elk1 activity and c-fos gene expression, proliferation, apoptosis and cell cycle. We demonstrated that let-7a1-mediated IGF1R downregulation was accompanied by attenuation of Elk1 activity and c-fos expression, inhibition of cell proliferation, enhanced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest, and that loss function of let-7a1 via inhibition can upregulate IGF1R accompanied by an increase of Elk1 activity and c-fos expression, thereby enhancing cell proliferation.

In the present study, microRNA microarray analysis suggested that the expression of miR-205 was significantly decreased in advanced PCa compared with early PCa. Real-time PCR analysis also indicated that miR-205 expression was significantly decreased in PCa tissues compared with non-cancerous tissues. Moreover, the expression of miR-205 has been demonstrated to be associated with the clinicopathological stage and total/free prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level of PCa. Functional analyses showed that both the overexpression of miR-205 and the knockdown of c-SRC in PCa cell lines could inhibit cell growth, colony formation, migration, invasion and the cell cycle as well as induce cell apoptosis in vitro. Furthermore, over-expressing miR-205 reduced tumorigenicity in vivo. Through a luciferase activity assay and Western blotting, c-SRC was identified as a target of miR-205 in cells.

Delineating the aberrant epigenome produced during toxicant-mediated malignant transformation will help identify the underlying epigenetic drivers of environmental toxicant-induced carcinogenesis. Gene promoter DNA methylation and gene expression profiling of arsenite-transformed prostate epithelial cells showed a negative correlation between gene expression changes and DNA methylation changes; however, less than 10% of the genes with increased promoter methylation were downregulated. Studies described herein confirm that a majority of the DNA hypermethylation events occur at H3K27me3 marked genes that were already transcriptionally repressed. In contrast to aberrant DNA methylation targeting H3K27me3 pre-marked silent genes, we found that actively expressed C2H2 zinc finger genes (ZNFs) marked with H3K9me3 on their 3' ends, were the favored targets of DNA methylation linked gene silencing. DNA methylation coupled, H3K9me3 mediated gene silencing of ZNF genes was widespread, occurring at individual ZNF genes on multiple chromosomes and across ZNF gene family clusters. At ZNF gene promoters, H3K9me3 and DNA hypermethylation replaced H3K4me3, resulting in a widespread downregulation of ZNF gene expression, which accounted for 8% of all the downregulated genes in the arsenical-transformed cells. In summary, these studies associate toxicant exposure with widespread silencing of ZNF genes by DNA hypermethylation-linked H3K9me3 spreading, further implicating epigenetic dysfunction as a driver of toxicant associated carcinogenesis.""","""['Paul L Severson', 'Erik J Tokar', 'Lukas Vrba', 'Michael P Waalkes', 'Bernard W Futscher']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Epigenetics""","""['Agglomerates of aberrant DNA methylation are associated with toxicant-induced malignant transformation.', ""Characterization of the contradictory chromatin signatures at the 3' exons of zinc finger genes."", 'Global profiling of histone and DNA methylation reveals epigenetic-based regulation of gene expression during epithelial to mesenchymal transition in prostate cells.', 'Gene methylation in gastric cancer.', 'Design and Application of 6mA-Specific Zinc-Finger Proteins for the\xa0Readout of DNA Methylation.', 'Targeted DNA demethylation of the ZNF334 promoter inhibits colorectal cancer growth.', 'Disruption of ZNF334 promotes triple-negative breast carcinoma malignancy through the SFRP1/ Wnt/β-catenin signaling axis.', 'Arsenic Exposure and Cancer-Related Proteins in Urine of Indigenous Bolivian Women.', 'ZNF577 Methylation Levels in Leukocytes From Women With Breast Cancer Is Modulated by Adiposity, Menopausal State, and the Mediterranean Diet.', 'Co-occurrence and Mutual Exclusivity Analysis of DNA Methylation Reveals Distinct Subtypes in Multiple Cancers.']"""

RARP has been linked to an increased use of adjuvant treatments. If RARP would result in an increased local recurrence rate, response rates to SRT could be expected to be better after RARP than after more conventional methods of prostatectomy. The incidence and efficacy of SRT in a RARP population were compared with nomogram prediction.  Methods:   Patient data were prospectively registered. Biochemical recurrence (BCR) was defined as a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) ≥0.1 ng/mL. SRT was offered to men with BCR after RARP. The Stephenson nomogram predictions were compared with outcome after SRT.  Results:   Of 1087 men, 157 (14.4%) received SRT for BCR or persistent PSA levels during a median follow-up of 1078 days after RARP. Median PSA level before SRT was 0.2 ng/mL. Three-year BCR-free rate was 64% for men after SRT. pN (pNx, pN0, pN1) and PSA level before SRT were independent predictors of the BCR interval after SRT. Men with more extensive fascia preservation were more likely to respond favorably to SRT. The Stephenson nomogram prediction showed a concordance rate of 0.66 in this RARP population. Limitations of the study are the retrospective design and limited follow-up duration.  Conclusion:   In our RARP series, the use and efficacy of SRT were comparable with open prostatectomy series.

Advances in understanding the molecular mechanisms of prostate cancer progression, however, have not translated well to the clinic. Patients with metastatic and hormone-refractory disease have only palliative options for treatment, as chemotherapy seldom produces durable or complete responses, highlighting the need for novel therapeutic approaches. T-oligo, a single-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid with partial sequence homology to human telomeric DNA, has elicited cytostatic and/or cytotoxic effects in multiple cancer cell types. In contrast, normal primary cells of varying tissue types are resistant to cytotoxic actions of T-oligo, underscoring its potential utility as a novel targeted cancer therapeutic. Mechanistically, T-oligo is hypothesized to interfere with normal telomeric structure and form G-quadruplex structures, thereby inducing genomic stress in addition to aberrant upregulation of DNA damageresponse pathways. Here, we present data demonstrating the enhanced effectiveness of a deoxyguanosine-enriched sequence of T-oligo, termed (GGTT)4, which elicits robust cytotoxic effects in prostate cancer cells at lower concentrations than the most recent T-oligo sequence (5'-pGGT TAG GTG TAG GTT T 3') described to date and used for comparison in this study, while exerting no cytotoxic actions on nontransformed human prostate epithelial cells.

Two observers independently reviewed DCE-MRI data using three methodologies: qualitative, in which kinetic curves of signal intensity versus time were generated for foci showing rapid enhancement on subtracted contrast-enhanced images; semiquantitative, in which a biexponential heuristic model was used to generate color-coded maps depicting maximum slope and washout of contrast enhancement; and quantitative, in which a Tofts model was used to generate color-coded influx rate transfer constant (Ktrans) and efflux rate transfer constant (Kep) maps. Findings were stratified by whether suspicious foci showed evidence of washout with each method and compared with histopathologic results in each sextant.  Results:   There was similar accuracy for the semiquantitative and quantitative models for both observers irrespective of requiring evidence of washout. For the more experienced observer, requiring washout resulted in lower sensitivity and higher specificity for the qualitative and semiquantitative models. Also for the more experienced observer, use of either a semiquantitative or quantitative model provided greater sensitivity compared with a qualitative model when requiring washout. There was no association between tumor detection and Gleason score for any DCE-MRI methodology for either reader.

Methods:   19 PC with dominant Gleason grade ≥ 8 were studied. Expression of PSA, PSMA, RKIP, Raf-1, MEK-1, ERK-1, ERK-2, p-Akt (T308), p-Akt (S473), NF- κ B p50, and NF- κ Bp65 were detected immunohistochemically.  Results:   . Loss of RKIP in the most immunoexpressed PC (PSA+, PSMA+) profile was associated with increased levels of PSA and PSMA expression. Intensities of immunoreactions to PSA and PSMA were higher in cancer cells negative for RKIP (12.51 ± 1.6 and 34.95 ± 1.92) compared to those positive for RKIP (4.68 ± 1.11 and 28.56 ± 0.91). In parallel, missing RKIP expression in PC patients with PSA+, PSMA+ profile was connected with increased components of both Raf-1/MEK/ERK and NF- κ B (p65/p50), whereas Akt is activated independently of RKIP.  Conclusions:   Although characterized by the same (PSA+, PSMA+) profile, PC phenotype missing the RKIP related to invasive potential and greater biological aggressiveness reflected in overexpression of components of Raf-1/MEK/ERK and NF- κ B (p65/p50) in which Akt is activated independently of RKIP. Taking into account the PC phenotypes according to RKIP among PSA-PSMA profiles may improve distinguishing them from cancers that will become more aggressive and therefore adapt the therapeutic strategies in those patients.""","""['Awatef Ben Jemaa', 'Yosra Bouraoui', 'Sataa Sallami', 'Yassine Nouira', 'Ridha Oueslati']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Biomed Res Int""","""['PSMA-PSA clones controlled by full Akt phosphorylation (T308+,S473+) recapitulate molecular features of human prostate cancer.', 'Cellular distribution and heterogeneity of Psa and Psma expression in normal, hyperplasia and human prostate cancer.', 'PSA-PSMA profiles and their impact on sera PSA levels and angiogenic activity in hyperplasia and human prostate cancer.', 'Prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) ligands for diagnosis and therapy of prostate cancer.', 'The biology of a prostate cancer metastasis suppressor protein: Raf kinase inhibitor protein.', 'Insights of RKIP-Derived Suppression of Prostate Cancer.', 'Molecular regulation of bone marrow metastasis in prostate and breast cancer.']"""

The purpose of the study was to investigate the in vitro effect of LBH589 alone and in combination with RT on the growth and survival of CaP cell lines and the possible mechanisms of radiosensitization of this combination therapy. The effect of LBH589 alone or in combination with RT on two CaP cell lines (PC-3 and LNCaP) and a normal prostatic epithelial cell line (RWPE-1) was studied by MTT and clonogenic assays, cell cycle analysis, western blotting of apoptosis-related and cell check point proteins, and DNA double strand break (DSB) repair markers. The immunofluorescence staining was used to further confirm DSB expression in treated CaP cells. Our results indicate that LBH589 inhibited proliferation in both CaP and normal prostatic epithelial cells in a time-and-dose-dependent manner; low-dose of LBH589 (IC20) combined with RT greatly improved efficiency of cell killing in CaP cells; compared to RT alone, the combination treatment with LBH589 and RT induced more apoptosis and led to a steady increase of sub-G1 population and abolishment of RT-induced G2/M arrest, increased and persistent DSB, less activation of non-homologous end joining (NHEJ)/homologous recombination (HR) repair pathways and a panel of cell cycle related proteins.

However, molecular mechanisms by which endocrine-related pathways and VEGF signalling cooperatively promote breast cancer progression remain poorly understood. In the present study, we show that the A-type cyclin, cyclin A1, known for its important role in the initiation of leukemia and prostate cancer metastasis, is highly expressed in primary breast cancer specimens and metastatic lesions, in contrasting to its barely detectable expression in normal human breast tissues. There is a statistically significant correlation between cyclin A1 and VEGF expression in breast cancer specimens from two patient cohorts (p<0.01). Induction of cyclin A1 overexpression in breast cancer cell line MCF-7 results in an enhanced invasiveness and a concomitant increase in VEGF expression. In addition, there is a formation of protein-protein complexes between cyclin A1 and estrogen receptor ER-α cyclin A1 overexpression increases ER-α expression in MCF-7 and T47D cells.

However, these tumors eventually relapse resulting in recurrent castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Currently, there is no effective therapy for CRPC and the molecular mechanisms that lead to the development of CRPC are not well understood. Here, we evaluated the hypothesis that combined inhibition of Hedgehog (Hh) and androgen receptor (AR) signaling will synergistically attenuate the growth of CRPC in vitro and in vivo. Androgen deprivation induced full-length androgen receptor protein levels in CRPC cells, but decreased its nuclear localization and transcriptional activity. However, androgen deprivation also increased a truncated form of androgen receptor (lacking ligand-binding domain) that possessed transcriptional activity in CRPC cells. Androgen deprivation also promoted the expression of Hh signaling components in CRPC cells, xenograft tumors, and the prostate glands of castrated mice. Importantly, although inhibition of either Hh or androgen receptor signaling alone was only moderately effective in blocking CRPC cell growth, combination of an Hh pathway inhibitor and a noncompetitive androgen receptor inhibitor synergistically suppressed the growth of CRPC cells in vitro and in vivo.

Design:   Cross-sectional, descriptive.  Setting:   Ambulatory care clinic of a large medical center.  Sample:   135 men receiving ADT.  Methods:   A structured interview with a systematic procedure was used to elicit preferences for physical activity.  Main research variables:   Exercise preferences and acceptability; evidence-based exercise intervention.  Findings:   Participants expressed high levels of acceptability of and willingness to participate in aerobic (64% and 79%) and muscle-strengthening (79% and 81%) programs. Preferences were expressed for muscle-strengthening activities performed at home, either alone or in the company of a family member. Flexible, spontaneous, and self-paced programs were preferred. Significant associations were identified for distance, age, obesity, duration of ADT, and meeting American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) and American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines. Nineteen percent of the study population met the guidelines for weekly physical activity.  Conclusions:   High levels of expressed acceptance of and willingness to participate in physical activity programs as well as the small number of participants meeting ACSM and AHA guidelines suggest feasibility of and support the need for the development of exercise programs in this population.

Simulations assume a joint null hypothesis of no effect of either the risk factor or screening on the preclinical incidence of cancer, and then quantify the bias as the risk-factor odds ratio (OR) from this null study. This bias can be used as a factor to adjust observed OR in the actual study.  Results:   For this particular study design, as average preclinical duration increased, the bias in the total-physical activity OR monotonically increased from 1% to 22% above the null, but the smoking OR monotonically decreased from 1% above the null to 5% below the null.

It is considered to be involved in the cell-proliferation inhibition and/or cell-death induction activity. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the role of PSCA gene polymorphisms in gallbladder cancer risk in North Indian population.  Methodology:   A total of 405 gallbladder cancer patients and 247 healthy controls were included in the case-control study for risk prediction. We examined the association of two functional SNPs, rs2294008 and rs2978974 in PSCA gene by genotyping using Taqman allelic discrimination assays. Statistical analysis was done using SPSS software, version 17. Linkage disequilibrium and haplotype analysis was done with the help of SNPstats software. FDR test was used to correct for multiple comparisons.  Results:   No significant associations of rs2294008 and rs2978974 genetic variants of the PSCA gene were found with GBC risk at allele, genotype or haplotype levels. Stratifying the subjects on the basis of gallstone also did not show any significant result. However, on gender stratification, we found a significant association of Trs2294008-Grs2978974 haplotype with higher risk of GBC in females (FDR Pcorr=0.021, OR=1.6). In contrary, Trs2294008-A rs2978974 haplotype conferred significant lower risk in males (FDR Pcorr=0.013; OR=0.25).

Methods:   Three PIVOT Endpoints Committee members, blinded to randomized treatment assignments, reviewed medical records and death certificates when available to assign a cause of death using a primary and a secondary adjudication question. Initial disagreements were resolved through discussion. The level of initial agreement among committee members was examined, as well as guesses at randomized treatment assignments for a convenience sample of cases. Final cause of death determinations were compared to death certificates.  Results:   Complete agreement on cause of death by all three committee members before any discussion was achieved in 200/354 (56%) cases on the primary and 209/354 (59%) cases on the secondary. However, complete agreement on the primary rose to 306/354 (86%) when 'definite' and 'probably' categories were collapsed, as planned a priori. The three committee members' proportions of correct guesses of randomized treatment assignment were 82/121 (68%), 113/148 (76%), and 99/134 (74%). Using the committee's final adjudications as a gold standard, death certificates had suboptimal sensitivities, specificities, or predictive values depending on how they were used to determine cause of death.  Limitations:   There was no separate 'gold standard' by which to judge the accuracy of the final endpoints committee adjudications, and useful death certificates could not be obtained on about a third of PIVOT participants who died.

Technical considerations:   Six consecutive patients with intractable hematuria not responding to standard treatment underwent intravesical instillation of a hemostatic bovine-derived gelatin matrix mixed with a human-derived thrombin component. The technical aspects of this approach are described in detail. The mean age of the patients was 70 ± 4 years (median 71, range 50-79). All patients had pelvic malignancy: 5 had prostate cancer, and 1, cervical cancer. Mean duration of hematuria before intervention was 6 ± 1 days (median 6, range 2-9). Mean preoperative hemoglobin level was 9.2 ± 0.5 g/dL (median 9.0, range 8.0-10.2). Complete control of bleeding was achieved in 5 patients (83%) and all 6 patients (100%) on day 1 and 7, respectively. At a mean follow-up of 10 ± 6 months (median 13, range 1-15), permanent control of bleeding was achieved in 5 of 6 patients (83%).

Methods:   Patients were identified who underwent an open radical prostatectomy by one of two surgeons at the Johns Hopkins Hospital between 1992 and 2003. The first surgeon routinely performed a limited pelvic LN dissection (LPLND), whereas the second performed an EPLND. Men with positive LNs from each cohort were compared for differences in oncologic outcomes.  Results:   Positive LNs were found in 94 men (2.2%), 21 (22.3%) with an LPLND and 73 (77.7%) with an EPLND. On average, LPLND and EPLND yielded 11.4 and 14.6 nodes, respectively (P = .022). The two groups were similar in terms of the number of positive LNs (1.4 vs 1.8, P = .223) and the proportion of patients with <15% positive nodes (57.1% vs 69.9%, P = .300). At a median follow-up of 10.5 years, patients who underwent an EPLND had superior oncologic outcomes compared with the LPLND group: 5-year biochemical recurrence-free survival of 30.1% vs 7.1% (P = .018), 10-year metastasis-free survival of 62.2% vs 22.2% (P = .035), and 10-year cancer-specific survival of 83.6% vs 52.6% (P = .199).

Expression of functional voltage-gated Na(+) channels (Nav) is implicated in the metastatic potential of breast, prostate, lung and colon cancer cells. However, the cellular mechanisms that regulate Nav expression in cancer remain largely unknown. Growth factors are attractive candidates; they not only play crucial roles in cancer progression but are also key regulators of ion channel expression and activity in non-cancerous cells. Here, we examine the role of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signalling and Nav in non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) cell lines. We show unequivocally, that functional expression of the α subunit Nav1.7 promotes invasion in H460 NSCLC cells. Inhibition of Nav1.7 activity (using tetrodotoxin) or expression (by using small interfering RNA), reduces H460 cell invasion by up to 50%. Crucially, non-invasive wild type A549 cells lack functional Nav, whereas exogenous overexpression of the Nav1.7 α subunit is sufficient to promote TTX-sensitive invasion of these cells. EGF/EGFR signalling enhances proliferation, migration and invasion of H460 cells but we find that, specifically, EGFR-mediated upregulation of Nav1.7 is necessary for invasive behaviour in these cells. Examination of Nav1.7 expression at mRNA, protein and functional levels further reveals that EGF/EGFR signalling via the ERK1/2 pathway controls transcriptional regulation of channel expression to promote cellular invasion. Immunohistochemistry of patient biopsies confirms the clinical relevance of Nav1.7 expression in NSCLC. Thus, Nav1.7 has significant potential as a new target for therapeutic intervention and/or as a diagnostic or prognostic marker in NSCLC.""","""['Thomas M Campbell', 'Martin J Main', 'Elizabeth M Fitzgerald']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Cell Sci""","""['Voltage-gated sodium channels potentiate the invasive capacities of human non-small-cell lung cancer cell lines.', 'Derlin-1 is overexpressed in non-small cell lung cancer and promotes cancer cell invasion via EGFR-ERK-mediated up-regulation of MMP-2 and MMP-9.', 'SRC promotes survival and invasion of lung cancers with epidermal growth factor receptor abnormalities and is a potential candidate for molecular-targeted therapy.', 'Molecular pharmacology of voltage-gated sodium channel expression in metastatic disease: clinical potential of neonatal Nav1.5 in breast cancer.', 'Structure-based assessment of disease-related mutations in human voltage-gated sodium channels.', 'Voltage-gated sodium channels: from roles and mechanisms in the metastatic cell behavior to clinical potential as therapeutic targets.', 'Ion Channels as Potential Tools for the Diagnosis, Prognosis, and Treatment of HPV-Associated Cancers.', 'Voltage imaging reveals the dynamic electrical signatures of human breast cancer cells.', ""From HDAC to Voltage-Gated Ion Channels: What's Next?

Although anoikis resistance has been recognized as one of the hallmarks of metastatic prostate malignancies, the molecular events that cause anoikis resistance are poorly understood. In this study, we found that the detachment of PC-3 prostate cancer cells caused a time-dependent increase in the expression level of the leukotriene B4 receptor-2 (BLT2) and that BLT2 played a critical role in establishing anoikis resistance in these cells. Blocking BLT2 with the pharmacological inhibitor LY255283 or with RNAi knockdown clearly abolished anoikis resistance and resulted in severe apoptotic death. Additionally, we demonstrated that the activation of NADPH oxidase (NOX) and subsequent generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were downstream of BLT2 signaling and led to the activation of NF-κB, thus establishing anoikis resistance during cell detachment. Furthermore, we observed that the ectopic expression of BLT2 in normal prostate PWR-1E cells rendered the cells resistant to anoikis and apparently diminished apoptotic cell death following detachment. Taken together, our results suggest that BLT2-NOX-ROS-NF-κB cascade induction during detachment confers a novel mechanism of anoikis resistance in prostate cancer cells and potentially contributes to prostate cancer progression.""","""['Jin-Wook Lee', 'Jae-Hong Kim']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Biol Chem""","""['Ras promotes transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition via a leukotriene B4 receptor-2-linked cascade in mammary epithelial cells.', 'BLT2 promotes the invasion and metastasis of aggressive bladder cancer cells through a reactive oxygen species-linked pathway.', 'Up-regulation of BLT2 is critical for the survival of bladder cancer cells.', 'Role of Leukotriene B4 Receptor-2 in Mast Cells in Allergic Airway Inflammation.', 'BLT2, a leukotriene B4 receptor 2, as a novel prognostic biomarker of triple-negative breast cancer.', 'Hepatic stellate cell stearoyl co-A desaturase activates leukotriene B4 receptor 2 - β-catenin cascade to promote liver tumorigenesis.', 'Anoikis in phenotypic reprogramming of the prostate tumor microenvironment.', 'LMP1 promotes nasopharyngeal carcinoma metastasis through NTRK2-mediated anoikis resistance.', 'Structure of the agonist 12-HHT in its BLT2 receptor-bound state.', 'Biological functions of 12(S)-hydroxyheptadecatrienoic acid as a ligand of leukotriene B4 receptor 2.']"""

Triptolide treatment increased VSV replication in the human prostate cancer cell line PC3 and in other VSV-resistant cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, triptolide (TPL) inhibited the innate antiviral response by blocking type I interferon (IFN) signaling, downstream of IRF3 activation. Furthermore, triptolide-enhanced VSV-induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent fashion in VSV-resistant cells, as measured by annexin-V, cleaved caspase-3, and B-cell lymphoma 2 staining. In vivo, using the TSA mammary adenocarcinoma and PC3 mouse xenograft models, combination treatment with VSV and triptolide delayed tumor growth and prolonged survival of tumor-bearing animals by enhancing viral replication.

Methods:   Based on a case-control study, 124 patients with prostate cancer and 138 age-matched control subjects were recruited. Information of clinical phenotype and life style, etc. in the prostate cancer patients was collected. We compared the differences of allele and genotype frequencies of TET2 (rs7679673, A), LMTK2 (rs6465657, T) and FAM84B (rs12543663, C) gene expressions between the two groups for the allele and genotype frequencies, and explored the relationship between different genotypes and clinical features such as patient age, BMI, Gleason score, PSA level and tumor stage, by Chi-square test in patients with PCa. Multifactor dimensionality reduction was used to detect the gene-gene interactions.  Results:   The FAM84B (rs12543663, C) C carriers frequency had significant difference between the case group and the control group (χ(2) = 3.980 P = 0.046; OR = 1.883; 95%CI = 1.006-3.526).

Higher serum Ct levels are associated with larger tumor size, distant metastases, and prognosis. We report herein a case of prostate and multiple bone metastases of nonfamilial MTC with mildly elevated Ct levels.  Patient findings:   A 73-year-old man who was found to have a 2.5 cm MTC in the left thyroid lobe with cervical lymph node metastases presented with confused mental status because of severe hypercalcemia (albumin-modified serum calcium concentration 15.2 mg/dL) associated with multiple bone metastases. Prostate biopsy was performed because the patient had frequent urination with mildly elevated serum prostate-specific antigen (5.297 ng/mL). Histologically, the prostate was diagnosed as MTC metastasis, forming a tissue architecture closely resembling the previously diagnosed MTC, and the cells were positive for Ct, carcinoembryonic antigen, and thyroid transcription factor 1. Although the patient had multiple MTC metastases, basal and calcium-stimulated serum Ct levels were not significantly elevated, measuring 22.7 pg/mL (normal <10 pg/mL) and 22.1 pg/mL, respectively.  Conclusions:   A chronic hypercalcemic state may exhaust Ct reserves and diminish the Ct response to an acute intravenous calcium injection. Therefore, the Ct level of a patient in a hypercalcemic state should be carefully interpreted.

However, the discovery of curative therapies for HRPCa is hampered by the lack of authentic preclinical models.  Methods:   We improved upon tumorgraft models that have been shown to predict drug response in other cancer types by implanting thin, precision-cut slices of HRPCa under the renal capsule of immunodeficient mice. Tissue slice grafts (TSGs) from 6 cases of HRPCa were established in mice. Following androgen deprivation by castration, TSGs were recovered and the presence and phenotype of cancer cells were evaluated.  Results:   High-grade cancer in TSGs generated from HRPCa displayed characteristic Gleason patterns and biomarker expression. Response to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) was as in humans, with some cases exhibiting complete pathologic regression and others showing resistance to castration. As in humans, ADT decreased cell proliferation and prostate-specific antigen expression in TSGs. Adverse pathological features of parent HRPCa were associated with lack of regression of cancer in corresponding TSGs after ADT. Castration-resistant cancer cells remaining in TSGs showed upregulated expression of androgen receptor target genes, as occurs in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) in humans. Finally, a rare subset of castration-resistant cancer cells in TSGs underwent epithelial-mesenchymal transition, a process also observed in CRPC in humans.  Conclusions:   Our study demonstrates the feasibility of generating TSGs from multiple patients and of generating a relatively large number of TSGs from the same HRPCa specimen with similar cell composition and histology among control and experimental samples in an in vivo setting. The authentic response of TSGs to ADT, which has been extensively characterized in humans, suggests that TSGs can serve as a surrogate model for clinical trials to achieve rapid and less expensive screening of therapeutics for HRPCa and primary CRPC.""","""['Hongjuan Zhao', 'Alan Thong', 'Rosalie Nolley', 'Stephen W Reese', 'Jennifer Santos', 'Alexandre Ingels', 'Donna M Peehl']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Transl Med""","""['N-cadherin increases after androgen deprivation and is associated with metastasis in prostate cancer.', 'Androgen deprivation causes epithelial-mesenchymal transition in the prostate: implications for androgen-deprivation therapy.', 'Inhibition of LSD1 by Pargyline inhibited process of EMT and delayed progression of prostate cancer in\xa0vivo.', 'Oxidative stress and androgen receptor signaling in the development and progression of castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Experimental in vitro, ex\xa0vivo and in vivo models in prostate cancer research.', 'Harnessing the Utility of Ex Vivo Patient Prostate Tissue Slice Cultures.', 'Characterization of a castrate-resistant prostate cancer xenograft derived from a patient of West African ancestry.', 'PDX: Moving Beyond Drug Screening to Versatile Models for Research Discovery.', 'Dynamics of Cellular Plasticity in Prostate Cancer Progression.']"""

The purpose of this study was to implement and experimentally validate a method for time-resolved motion including dose reconstruction for volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) treatments delivered with and without DMLC tracking.  Material and methods:   Tracking experiments were carried out on a linear accelerator (Trilogy, Varian) with a prototype DMLC tracking system. A motion stage carrying a biplanar dosimeter phantom (Delta4PT, Scandidos) reproduced eight representative clinical tumor trajectories (four lung, four prostate). For each trajectory, two single-arc 6 MV VMAT treatments with low and high modulation were delivered to the moving phantom with and without DMLC tracking. An existing in-house developed program that adds target motion to treatment plans was extended with the ability to split an arc plan into any number of sub-arcs, allowing the calculated dose for different parts of the treatment to be examined individually. For each VMAT sub-arc, reconstructed and measured doses were compared using dose differences and 3%/3 mm γ-tests.  Results:   For VMAT sub-arcs the reconstructed dose distributions had a mean root-mean-square (rms) dose difference of 2.1% and mean γ failure rate of 2.0% when compared with the measured doses. For final accumulated doses the mean rms dose difference was 1.6% and the γ failure rate was 0.7%.

However, UA presents a low solubility in aqueous medium, which presents a barrier to its biological applications. In this context, the use of liposomes presents a promising strategy to deliver UA and allow for its intravenous administration. In this work, long-circulating and pH-sensitive liposomes containing UA (SpHL-UA) were developed, and their chemical and physicochemical properties were evaluated. SpHL-UA presented adequate properties, including a mean diameter of 191.1 ± 6.4 nm, a zeta potential of 1.2 ± 1.4 mV, and a UA entrapment of 0.77 ± 0.01 mg/mL.

Recent evidence suggest that targeted blockade of multiple immunosuppressive pathways can induce synergistic antitumor responses.  Experimental design:   In this study, we investigated whether targeted blockade of CD73, an ectonucleotidase that catabolizes the hydrolysis of extracellular adenosine monophosphate (AMP) to adenosine, can enhance the antitumor activity of anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 mAbs against transplanted and chemically induced mouse tumors.  Results:   Anti-CD73 mAb significantly enhanced the activity of both anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 mAbs against MC38-OVA (colon) and RM-1 (prostate) subcutaneous tumors, and established metastatic 4T1.2 breast cancer. Anti-CD73 mAb also significantly enhanced the activity of anti-PD-1 mAb against 3-methylcholanthrene (MCA)-induced fibrosarcomas. Gene-targeted mice revealed that single-agent therapies and combinatorial treatments were dependent on host IFN-γ and CD8(+) T cells, but independent of perforin.

It is less clear that loss of PTEN also increases the risk of cancer mortality. We investigated the association between PTEN expression and prostate cancer mortality and the potential effect modification by IGF-IR, a direct activator of the phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) pathway.  Methods:   Protein expression in tumor was evaluated using tumor tissues obtained from 805 participants of the Physicians' Health and the Health Professionals Follow-up studies who were diagnosed with prostate cancer and underwent radical prostatectomy. Proportional hazard models were used to assess PTEN expression and its interaction with IGF-IR, in relation to lethal prostate cancer (cancer-specific death or distant metastases).  Results:   Low PTEN expression was associated with an increased risk of lethal prostate cancer [HR, 1.7; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.98-3.2; Ptrend = 0.04]. The association was attenuated after adjustment for Gleason grade, tumor stage, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) at diagnosis. A significant negative interaction between PTEN and IGF-IR was found (Pinteraction = 0.03). Either reduction in PTEN or increase in IGF-IR expression was sufficient to worsen prognosis. Models including PTEN and IGF-IR expression offer additional predicting power to prostate cancer survival, compared to those only including demographic and clinical factors.

However, its linkage to androgen receptor (AR)-mediated PCa progression remains unclear. Here, we identified a previously unrecognized regulation: targeting AR with siRNA in PCa cells increased macrophage recruitment via CCL2 up-regulation, which might then result in enhancing PCa invasiveness. Molecular mechanism dissection revealed that targeting PCa AR with siRNA promoted PCa cell migration/invasion via CCL2-dependent STAT3 activation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) pathways. Importantly, pharmacologic interruption of the CCL2/CCR2-STAT3 axis suppressed EMT and PCa cell migration, providing a new mechanism linking CCL2 and EMT. Simultaneously targeting PCa AR with siRNA and the CCL2/CCR2-STAT3 axis resulted in better suppression of PCa growth and metastasis in a xenograft PCa mouse model. Human PCa tissue microarray analysis suggests that increased CCL2 expression may be potentially associated with poor prognosis of PCa patients.

In this meta-analysis, we aimed to evaluate the effects of (CAG)n repeat genetic polymorphisms on the incidence of prostate cancer, particularly as regards race, study design and the number of (CAG)n repeats. To collect articles published on the association between CAG repeats and prostate cancer, publications were identified from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database of epidemiological studies published up to October 2011; our identification of publications was not limited by a language barrier. The following search keywords were used: prostate cancer risk, CAG repeat polymorphism, androgen receptor gene and human. Stata version 10 was used for the meta-analysis and the publication bias was measured through the Begg's test and Egger's test. This meta-analysis included 47 studies with 13,346 cases and 15,172 control or non-cases and consisted of 31 reports based on Caucasians, ten on Asians, one on Hispanics and four on combined ethnic groups. The carriers of a shorter CAG repeat sequence had an increased risk of prostate cancer (OR 1.21, 95% CI 1.10-1.34 for all subjects; OR 1.21, 95% CI 1.10-1.34 for prospective studies; OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.15-1.51 for retrospective studies) regardless of the exact length of the CAG repeat, compared with carriers of a longer repeat sequence. In terms of race, the risk of carrying a shorter CAG repeat sequence was 1.10- and 1.83-fold higher than that of a longer repeat sequence in Caucasians and Asians, respectively. For the specific number of CAG repeat polymorphisms, carriers of <22 repeats were observed to have a higher risk of prostate cancer (OR 1.16, 95% CI 1.04-1.29) compared with carriers with ≥ 22 CAG repeat polymorphisms, particularly for Asians (OR 2.06, 95% CI 1.00-4.24).

The emergence of androgen-independent cells, however, leads to a tumor relapse under a condition of long-term androgen deprivation. Clinical trials suggest that intermittent androgen suppression (IAS) with alternating on- and off-treatment periods can delay the relapse when compared with continuous androgen suppression (CAS). In this paper, we propose a mathematical model for prostate tumor growth under IAS therapy. The model elucidates initial hormone sensitivity, an eventual relapse of a tumor under CAS therapy, and a delay of a relapse under IAS therapy, which are due to the coexistence of androgen-dependent cells, androgen-independent cells resulting from reversible changes by adaptation, and androgen-independent cells resulting from irreversible changes by genetic mutations. The model is formulated as a free boundary problem of partial differential equations that describe the evolution of populations of the abovementioned three types of cells during on-treatment periods and off-treatment periods. Moreover, the model can be transformed into a piecewise linear ordinary differential equation model by introducing three new volume variables, and the study of the resulting model may help to devise optimal IAS schedules.""","""['Youshan Tao', 'Qian Guo', 'Kazuyuki Aihara']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Math Biol""","""['A new protocol for intermittent androgen suppression therapy of prostate cancer with unstable saddle-point dynamics.', 'Nonlinear system identification for prostate cancer and optimality of intermittent androgen suppression therapy.', 'Intermittent androgen suppression delays progression to androgen-independent regulation of prostate-specific antigen gene in the LNCaP prostate tumour model.', 'Mathematical modelling of prostate cancer growth and its application to hormone therapy.', 'Mathematically modelling and controlling prostate cancer under intermittent hormone therapy.', 'Extracting Mutual Interaction Rules Using Fuzzy Structured Agent-based Model of Tumor-Immune System Interactions.', 'Mathematical Modelling for the Role of CD4+T Cells in Tumor-Immune Interactions.']"""

Structure-function relationships of Twist1 to cancer-related phenotypes are underappreciated, so we studied the requirement of the conserved Twist box domain for metastatic phenotypes in prostate cancer. Evidence suggests that Twist1 is overexpressed in clinical specimens and correlated with aggressive/metastatic disease. Therefore, we examined a transactivation mutant, Twist1-F191G, in prostate cancer cells using in vitro assays, which mimic various stages of metastasis. Twist1 overexpression led to elevated cytoskeletal stiffness and cell traction forces at the migratory edge of cells based on biophysical single-cell measurements. Twist1 conferred additional cellular properties associated with cancer cell metastasis including increased migration, invasion, anoikis resistance, and anchorage-independent growth. The Twist box mutant was defective for these Twist1 phenotypes in vitro. Importantly, we observed a high frequency of Twist1-induced metastatic lung tumors and extrathoracic metastases in vivo using the experimental lung metastasis assay. The Twist box was required for prostate cancer cells to colonize metastatic lung lesions and extrathoracic metastases. Comparative genomic profiling revealed transcriptional programs directed by the Twist box that were associated with cancer progression, such as Hoxa9. Mechanistically, Twist1 bound to the Hoxa9 promoter and positively regulated Hoxa9 expression in prostate cancer cells. Finally, Hoxa9 was important for Twist1-induced cellular phenotypes associated with metastasis. These data suggest that the Twist box domain is required for Twist1 transcriptional programs and prostate cancer metastasis.

To explore whether loss of P53 influences the invasion and metastasis ability of prostate cancer cells, we first compared the invasion ability of si-P53 treated cells and control cells by wound healing, transwell assay, and adhesion assay. We next tested the activity of MMP-2, MMP-9, and MMP-14 by western blot and gelatin zymography. Moreover, we employed WB and IF to identify the EMT containing E-cad, N-cad, vimentin, etc. We also examined the expression of cortactin, cytoskeleton, and paxillin by immunofluorescence, and tested the expression of ERK and JNK by WB. Finally, we applied WB to detect the expression of FAK, Src, and the phosphorylation of them to elucidate the mechanism of si-P53 influencing invasion and metastasis. According to the inhibition rate of si-P53, we choose the optimized volume of si-P53. With the volume, we compare the invasion and metastasis ability of Du145 and si-P53 treated cells. We find si-P53 promotes the invasion and metastasis in prostate cancer cells, increases the expression and activity of MMP-2/9 and MMP-14. Also, si-P53 promotes EMT and cytoskeleton rearrangement.

Although its mode of action is not fully understood, tasquinimod presumably exerts its unique anti-tumor action through inhibition of angiogenesis and immunomodulation. In clinical studies, tasquinimod demonstrated anti-tumor activity in prostate cancer in combination with a mild-to-moderate side effect profile. With single-agent tasquinimod, dose-limiting toxicity was amylase elevation without signs of pancreatitis and sinus tachycardia. The maximum tolerated dose in Phase I studies in patients with CRPC was once daily administration of 0.5-1-mg tasquinimod orally. In a Phase II trial, significant clinical activity has been demonstrated in asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic, chemotherapy-naive, metastatic CRPC (mCRPC) patients. Men were randomized to tasquinimod or placebo in a 2:1 fashion; treatment with tasquinimod resulted in significant improvement of median progression-free survival (7.6 vs 3.3 months with placebo; p = 0.0042). Based on these encouraging effects, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in men with minimally symptomatic mCRPC has been designed. This large Phase III trial, powered for a primary end point of progression-free survival, has now enrolled the target number of 1200 men.

Patients and methods:   We performed a retrospective analysis of 599 patients who underwent robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) by a single surgeon (DIL). All bladder neck dissections were graded between 1 and 4; higher grades corresponded to an increasing degree of robot-assisted bladder neck preservation (R-BNP). After grouping patients by R-BNP grade, postoperative continence and positive surgical margin (PSM) rates were compared. The association between R-BNP and continence was also assessed using multivariate binary logistic regression models.  Results:   Similar outcomes were seen for two definitions of continence (0 pads per day [ppd]; 0 ppd or security pad, respectively). A higher proportion of patients were continent at 3 months postoperatively who received grade 4 compared with grade 1 (P=0.043; P=0.001) and grade 2 (P=0.006; P=0.009); and grade 3 compared with grade 1 (P=0.048; P=0.002) and grade 2 (P=0.009; P=0.030) R-BNP. There was no difference between grade 1 and 2 (P=0.541; P=0.064), and grade 3 and 4 (P=0.898; P=0.584) R-BNP. At 1 year postoperatively, there was no difference among the four groups in continence rate (P=0.771; P=0.411). R-BNP was an independent predictor of continence at 3 months (odds ratio [OR] [95% confidence interval (CI)]=1.33 [1.06-1.67]; OR [95% CI]=1.45 [1.1-1.82]), but not at 1 year (OR [95% CI]=1.07 [0.82-1.39]; OR (95% CI)=1.30 [0.92-1.85]).

Several forms of cancer, including lung, prostate, breast, and colon over-express receptors for bombesin-like peptides. Therefore, radiolabeled bombesin analogs might be useful for tumor identification. Nevertheless, it is well known that higher tumor uptake can yield images in higher quality. Hence, drug delivery systems, such as liposomes, can be used to achieve a higher concentration of radiotracer in tumor site, and also improve the radiotracer stability, since peptides can suffer easily degradation in vivo by natural plasma and tissue peptides. In this paper, we prepared long-circulating, pH-sensitive liposomes and long-circulation, non-pH sensitive liposomes. Both formulations were able to encapsulate the radiolabeled bombesin derivative (99mTc-BBN(7_14)), and also showing high in vitro stability. Biodistribution studies were performed in Ehrlich tumor bearing-mice to compare the ability of pH-sensitive and non-pH sensitive liposomes to deliver 99mTc-BBN(7_14) to tumor site. Results showed higher tumor uptake (2-fold) when pH-sensitive liposomes were used, suggesting that these vesicles can facilitate the access to the tumor by releasing the diagnostic agent into the ideal area. As a result, tumor-to-muscle ratio achieved with pH-sensitive liposomes was higher than that obtained with non-pH-sensitive formulation. In addition, scintigraphic images for pH-sensitive liposomes showed evident tumor uptake, corroborating with biodistribution data. Therefore, the results presented in this paper suggest that pH-sensitive liposomes are able to deliver more efficiently the radiolabeled bombesin analog. This finding poses a new possibility to improve images quality, since the tumor-to-muscle ratio was strongly enhanced.""","""['André Luís Branco de Barros', 'Luciene das Graças Mota', 'Daniel Crístian Ferreira Soares', 'Cristina Maria de Souza', 'Geovanni Dantas Cassali', 'Mônica Cristina Oliveira', 'Valbert Nascimento Cardoso']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Biomed Nanotechnol""","""['Bombesin Encapsulated in Long-Circulating pH-Sensitive Liposomes as a Radiotracer for Breast Tumor Identification.', 'Tumor bombesin analog loaded long-circulating and pH-sensitive liposomes as tool for tumor identification.', 'Radiolabeled bombesin analogs for prostate cancer diagnosis: preclinical studies.', 'Bombesin derivative radiolabeled with technetium-99m as agent for tumor identification.', 'On the formulation of pH-sensitive liposomes with long circulation times.', 'Nanostrategies for Therapeutic and Diagnostic Targeting of Gastrin-Releasing Peptide Receptor.', 'Nanostructured Graphdiyne: Synthesis and Biomedical Applications.', 'Folate-coated, long-circulating and pH-sensitive liposomes enhance doxorubicin antitumor effect in a breast cancer animal model.', 'Nanoconjugation and Encapsulation Strategies for Improving Drug Delivery and Therapeutic Efficacy of Poorly Water-Soluble Drugs.', 'Functional biomimetic nanoparticles for drug delivery and theranostic applications in cancer treatment.']"""

Little is known about the global gene expression and epigenetic regulation in tumor endothelial cells. The identification of gene expression and epigenetic difference between human prostate tumor-derived endothelial cells (TdECs) and those in normal tissues may uncover unique biological features of TdEC and facilitate the discovery of new anti-angiogenic targets. We established a method for isolation of CD31+ endothelial cells from malignant and normal prostate tissue obtained at prostatectomy. TdECs and normal-derived ECs (NdECs) showed >90% enrichment in primary culture and demonstrated microvascular endothelial cell characteristics such as cobblestone morphology in monolayer culture, diI-acetyl-LDL uptake and capillary-tube like formation in Matrigel®. In vitro primary cultures of ECs maintained expression of endothelial markers such as CD31, von Willebrand factor, intercellular adhesion molecule, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1, and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2. We then conducted a pilot study of transcriptome and methylome analysis of TdECs and matched NdECs from patients with prostate cancer. We observed a wide spectrum of differences in gene expression and methylation patterns in endothelial cells, between malignant and normal prostate tissues. Array-based expression and methylation data were validated by qRT-PCR and bisulfite DNA pyrosequencing. Further analysis of transcriptome and methylome data revealed a number of differentially expressed genes with loci whose methylation change is accompanied by an inverse change in gene expression. Our study demonstrates the feasibility of isolation of ECs from histologically normal prostate and prostate cancer via CD31+ selection. The data, although preliminary, indicates that there exist widespread differences in methylation and transcription between TdECs and NdECs. Interestingly, only a small proportion of perturbed gene was overlapped between American (AA) and Caucasian American (CA) patients with prostate cancer. Our study indicates that identifying gene expression and/or epigenetic differences between TdECs and NdECs may provide us with new anti-angiogenic targets. Future studies will be required to further characterize the isolated ECs and determine the biological features that can be exploited in the prognosis and therapy of prostate cancer.""","""['Wei Luo', 'Qiang Hu', 'Dan Wang', 'Kristin K Deeb', 'Yingyu Ma', 'Carl D Morrison', 'Song Liu', 'Candace S Johnson', 'Donald L Trump']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['Novel role of Snail 1 in promoting tumor neoangiogenesis.', 'In vitro analysis of human periodontal microvascular endothelial cells.', 'Angiogenic properties of endometrial mesenchymal stromal cells in endothelial co-culture: an in vitro model of endometriosis.', 'WOMEN IN CANCER THEMATIC REVIEW: Diverse functions of DNA methylation: implications for prostate cancer and beyond.', 'Role of androgen and vitamin D receptors in endothelial cells from benign and malignant human prostate.', 'Endothelial cell plasticity at the single-cell level.', 'Tumor Endothelial Cells (TECs) as Potential Immune Directors of the Tumor Microenvironment - New Findings and Future Perspectives.', 'Epigenetic analysis identifies factors driving racial disparity in prostate cancer.', 'Interleukin-6-mediated epigenetic control of the VEGFR2 gene induces disorganized angiogenesis in human breast tumors.', 'The Epigenetic Profile of Tumor Endothelial Cells.

Using the largest CTV margins (10/7 mm), the D95 values accumulated over 35 fractions were within 2% of the planned value, regardless of the adaptive strategy used. For tighter margins (5 mm), the average D95 values dropped to approximately 73.0 Gy even with frequent repositioning, and daily replanning was necessary to correct this deficit. When personalized margins were applied to an adaptive CTV derived from the first 6 treatment fractions using the STAPLE (Simultaneous Truth and Performance Level Estimation) algorithm, target coverage could be maintained using a single replan 1 week into therapy. For all approaches, normal tissue parameters (rectum V(70Gy) and NTCP) remained within acceptable limits.  Conclusions:   The frequency of adaptive interventions depends on the size of the CTV combined with target margins used during IMRT optimization. The application of adaptive target margins (<5 mm) to an adaptive CTV determined 1 week into therapy minimizes the need for subsequent dose replanning.""","""['Jerry J Battista', 'Carol Johnson', 'David Turnbull', 'Jeff Kempe', 'Karl Bzdusek', 'Jacob Van Dyk', 'Glenn Bauman']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Assessment and management of interfractional variations in daily diagnostic-quality-CT guided prostate-bed irradiation after prostatectomy.', 'Strategies for online organ motion correction for intensity-modulated radiotherapy of prostate cancer: prostate, rectum, and bladder dose effects.', 'Evaluation of online/offline image guidance/adaptation approaches for prostate cancer radiation therapy.', 'Current status of intensity-modulated radiation therapy for prostate cancer: History, clinical results and future directions.', 'A review of adaptive radiotherapy for bladder cancer.', 'Dosimetric benefits of daily treatment plan adaptation for prostate cancer stereotactic body radiotherapy.', 'A Simulated Dosimetric Study of Contribution to Radiotherapy Accuracy by Fractional Image Guidance Protocol of Halcyon System.', 'Online daily assessment of dose change in head and neck radiotherapy without dose-recalculation.', 'Target margins in radiotherapy of prostate cancer.']"""

Previously, we demonstrated that TMPRSS4 mediates tumor cell invasion, migration, and metastasis. However, the mechanisms by which TMPRSS4 contributes to invasion are not fully understood. Here, we demonstrated that TMPRSS4 induced the transcription of the urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) gene through activating the transcription factors Sp1, Sp3, and AP-1 in mainly a JNK-dependent manner and that the induction of uPA was required for TMPRSS4-mediated cancer cell invasion and signaling events. In addition, the uPA receptor was involved in TMPRSS4-induced signaling activation and subsequent uPA expression probably through its association with TMPRSS4 on the cell surface. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that uPA expression was significantly correlated with TMPRSS4 expression in human lung and prostate cancers. These observations suggest that TMPRSS4 is an important regulator of uPA gene expression; the upregulation of uPA by TMPRSS4 contributes to invasion and may represent a novel mechanism for the control of invasion.""","""['Hye-Jin Min', 'Yunhee Lee', 'Xue-Feng Zhao', 'Young-Kyu Park', 'Myung Kyu Lee', 'Jung Weon Lee', 'Semi Kim']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Cell Signal""","""['TMPRSS4 induces cancer cell invasion through pro-uPA processing.', 'TMPRSS4 induces invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition through upregulation of integrin alpha5 and its signaling pathways.', 'TMPRSS4 induces invasion and proliferation of prostate cancer cells through induction of Slug and cyclin D1.', ""Osteopontin: it's role in regulation of cell motility and nuclear factor kappa B-mediated urokinase type plasminogen activator expression."", 'The urokinase plasminogen activator system in breast cancer invasion and metastasis.', 'TMPRSS4, a type II transmembrane serine protease, as a potential therapeutic target in cancer.', 'Genome-wide identification of A-to-I RNA editing events provides the functional implications in PDAC.', 'TMPRSS4 promotes cancer stem-like properties in prostate cancer cells through upregulation of SOX2 by SLUG and TWIST1.', 'An Integrated Microarray Analysis Reveals Significant Diagnostic and Prognostic Biomarkers in Pancreatic Cancer.', 'HNF‑4α downregulation promotes tumor migration and invasion by regulating E‑cadherin in renal cell carcinoma.']"""

Although routine PSA screening is not recommended in Denmark, testing without clinical indication increased during the past decade. We evaluated associations between socio-demographic or clinical characteristics and PSA testing without clinical indication.  Material and methods:   In the Danish Diet, Cancer and Health Cohort, we identified 1051 men with PC diagnosed in 1993-2008. Diagnostic and clinical characteristics were obtained from medical records, and socio-demographic information was retrieved from administrative registers. We used general logistic regression analysis to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for associations between socio-demographic or clinical characteristics and PSA testing without clinical indication. Cox regression analysis was used to examine associations with mortality.  Results:   PSA testing without clinical indication was less likely among patients > 67 years (OR 0.7; 0.5-1.0). Men who were, PSA tested without clinical indication, were more likely to have vocational training (OR 1.8; 1.1-2.9) or higher education (OR 1.5; 0.9-2.5) and less likely to have advanced disease (OR 0.6; 0.4-0.9). PSA testing without clinical indication more often preceded therapy with curative intent (OR 1.8; 1.1-2.9) and less often palliative treatment (OR 0.6; 0.3-1.0). Men who were PSA tested without clinical indication had non-significantly lower overall and PC-specific mortality [hazard ratios 0.8 (0.5-1.2) and 0.6 (0.3-1.1), respectively].  Conclusions:   PSA testing without clinical indication was associated with higher educational level. PC detected by PSA testing with no clinical indication was more often localized and treated with curative intent.""","""['Randi V Karlsen', 'Signe B Larsen', 'Jane Christensen', 'Klaus Brasso', 'Søren Friis', 'Anne Tjønneland', 'Susanne Oksbjerg Dalton']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Acta Oncol""","""['Variation in general practice prostate-specific antigen testing and prostate cancer outcomes: an ecological study.', 'Early detection of high-grade prostate cancer using digital rectal examination (DRE) in men with a prostate-specific antigen level of <2.5 ng/mL and the risk of death.', 'Correlates of prostate-specific antigen testing in a large multiethnic cohort.', 'Screening for prostate cancer with PSA testing: current status and future directions.', 'Prostatic specific antigen and bone scan in the diagnosis and follow-up of prostate cancer.

A comparative retrospective study: brachytherapy versus robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy versus active surveillance""","""Purpose:   To investigate the quality of life (QoL) after different treatment modalities for low-risk prostate cancer, including brachytherapy, robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP), and active surveillance (AS) with validated questionnaires.  Materials and methods:   From a prospective database, we selected a total of 144 men with low-grade localized prostate cancer including 65 (45.1%) patients with RALP, 29 (20.2%) with brachytherapy, and 50 (34.7%) whose cancer was managed with AS. QoL was routinely evaluated with validated questionnaires: The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC-QLQ-C30), EORTC-QLQ-Prostate Module (PR)25, International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF)-15, International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire Short Form (ICIQ-SF) with a minimum follow-up of 1 year.  Results:   In comparison with baseline scores, the brachytherapy group showed a significant decrease of QoL domain scores of voiding complaints (P=0.010), use of incontinence aids (P=0.011), sexual functioning domain (P=0.011), and erectile function (P≤0.001). In the RALP group, sexual function (P≤0.001), incontinence (P≤0.001), and erectile function were significantly affected. A decrease in sexual function was observed in 71% of men after RALP and 59% after brachytherapy. In 30% of men under AS, a decrease of erectile function score during follow-up was reported. Overall, no significant decrease in general QoL was observed neither for men under AS nor for men treated by brachytherapy or RALP. Clinical factors such as age, prostate size, prostate-specific antigen level, and nerve preservation during RALP were nonpredictive of overall QoL after treatment for the individual patient (P=0.676).  Conclusion:   Patients with low-risk prostate cancer who are treated with brachytherapy or RALP report deterioration of QoL of specific domains such as voiding, continence, and sexual functioning in comparison with AS patients. A decrease of erectile function was also observed during AS. Overall QoL was similar for all three treatments options.""","""['Cenk Acar', 'Cecile C Schoffelmeer', 'Corin Tillier', 'Willem de Blok', 'Erik van Muilekom', 'Henk G van der Poel']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Endourol""","""['Validated Prospective Assessment of Quality of Life After Robot-Assisted Laparoscopic Prostatectomy: Beyond Continence and Erections.', 'Impact on quality of life of radical prostatectomy after initial active surveillance: more to lose?', 'Interview-based versus questionnaire-based quality of life outcomes before and after prostatectomy.', 'Quality of life after low-dose rate-brachytherapy for prostate carcinoma - long-term results and literature review on QLQ-C30 and QLQ-PR25 results in published brachytherapy series.', 'Quality of Life Outcomes after Primary Treatment for Clinically Localised Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review.', 'The health-related quality of life in patients with prostate cancer managed with active surveillance using the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite survey: Systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Radical prostatectomy versus deferred treatment for localised prostate cancer.', 'Health-related quality of life and rates of toxicity after high-dose-rate brachytherapy in combination with external beam radiation therapy for high-risk prostate cancer.', 'The Quality of Life among Men Receiving Active Surveillance for Prostate Cancer: An Integrative Review.', 'Comparative Effectiveness of Conservative Management Compared to Cryotherapy in Localized Prostate Cancer Patients.']"""

Mechanical properties of prostate tissue are promising for distinguishing prostate cancer from healthy prostate tissue. The aim was to investigate the indentation loading response of a resonance sensor for discriminating prostate cancer tissue from normal tissue. Indentation measurements were done on prostate tissue specimens ex vivo from 10 patients from radical prostatectomy. The measurement areas were analysed using standard histological methods. The stiffness parameter was linearly dependent on the loading force (average R(2 )= 0.90) and an increased loading force caused a greater stiffness contrast of prostate cancer vs normal tissue. The accuracy of the stiffness contrast was assessed by the ROC curve with the area under the curve being 0.941 for a loading force of 12.8 mN.

In addition, their relationships with medical factors (e.g., cancer sites, treatments) and possible consequences (e.g., functioning) have yet to be established. This prospective study assessed the presence of clusters of patients in 828 participants scheduled to undergo surgery for cancer.  Methods:   The patients completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Insomnia Severity Index, the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory, the EORTC Quality-of-Life-Questionnaire-C30, and a physical symptoms questionnaire at baseline and 2, 6, 10, 14, and 18 months later.  Results:   Cluster analyses identified between five and eight clusters of patients depending on the time point. The ""Low Symptoms"" cluster was the most common (24.8 to 35.0% of the sample), whereas one with predominant nausea and vomiting symptoms was among the least common (1.6 to 3.5%). Significant differences were found between cancer sites, treatment regimens, quality of life, and functioning scores. Prostate cancer patients and those treated by surgery only were overrepresented in the ""Low"" cluster, whereas breast cancer patients were more likely to fall into the ""Moderate - Night Sweats"" cluster. Clusters with more severe psychological symptoms were associated with lower functioning and quality of life.  Conclusions:   This study revealed distinct clusters of patients that varied in number during cancer treatments.
