Recently, however, evidence has accumulated that, even for these patients, the oncologic outcome after radical prostatectomy is not uniformly poor.  Methods:   13 262 evaluable patients with prostate cancer were treated with radical prostatectomy from 1992 to 2012. 4391 had a locally advanced stage, lymphogenous metastases, and/or unfavorable histopathological tumor characteristics. The endpoints of this retrospective, monocentric study were biochemical recurrence-free survival (postoperative PSA value less than 0.2 ng/mL), carcinoma-specific survival, and overall survival.  Results:   The rates of biochemical recurrence-free survival, carcinoma-specific survival, and overall survival at 10 years were 53%, 98%, and 89% for patients with extraprostatic tumor growth (tumor stage pT3a, 2675 patients); 19%, 87%, and 79% for patients with demonstrated invasion of the seminal vesicle (pT3b, 1373 patients); and 3%, 77%, and 69% for patients with tumor invasion of neighboring organs (pT4, 53 patients). The corresponding figures were 14%, 81%, and 71% for patients with lymph node metastases (682 patients); 32%, 93%, and 85% for those with a preoperative PSA value above 20 ng/mL (728 patients); and 25%, 70%, and 58% for those with a prostatectomy Gleason score of 8 or more points (559 patients).  Conclusion:   Even patients with locally advanced, nodally metastasized, or localized high-risk prostate cancer do not necessarily have a poor outcome. Although most such patients have a biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy, their carcinoma-specific mortality within ten years of radical prostatectomy ranges from 2% to 30% depending on the risk constellation, while their overall survival rate over the same period ranges from 58% to 89%.""","""['Hendrik Isbarn', 'Hartwig Huland', 'Markus Graefen']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Dtsch Arztebl Int""","""['Impact of positive surgical margins on prostate-specific antigen failure after radical prostatectomy in adjuvant treatment-naïve patients.', 'Radical prostatectomy represents an effective treatment in patients with specimen-confined high pathological Gleason score prostate cancer.', 'Prostate-specific antigen persistence after radical prostatectomy as a predictive factor of clinical relapse-free survival and overall survival: 10-year data of the ARO 96-02 trial.', 'Long-term oncological outcomes after laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.', 'Enhancing the efficacy of radical prostatectomy in locally advanced prostate cancer.', 'Differential expression of E-cadherin and P-cadherin in pT3 prostate cancer: correlation with clinical and pathological features.', 'Intermediate-term outcome after PSMA-PET guided high-dose radiotherapy of recurrent high-risk prostate cancer patients.', 'Social medicine assessment of patients with prostate cancer.', 'Improved prostate cancer treatment in certified centers : Is the strategic vision realistic?.', 'The Significance of Accurate Determination of Gleason Score for Therapeutic Options and Prognosis of Prostate Cancer.']"""

Bone-targeted therapies such as denosumab or intravenous bisphosphonates (IVBs) reduce the risk of these complications. This study characterized patterns of IVB use in these patients in the USA.  Methods:   This was a retrospective, observational study using the Truven Health MarketScan(®) Commercial and Medicare databases (2002-2011). Subjects with ≥1 claims of diagnosis of breast, lung, or prostate cancer (BC, LC, or PC) and ≥1 claims of BMets diagnosis were included. The date of first BMet diagnosis claim was the ""index date."" Key exclusion criteria were diagnosis of other primary cancer, receipt of IVB, or <6 months continuous enrollment pre-index. Cumulative incidence of treatment initiation, interruption, and discontinuation were estimated. Proportions of IVB claims with chemotherapy administered on the same day and with renal monitoring within 2 weeks prior were summarized. Multivariate regressions assessing factors associated with IVB initiation were conducted.  Results:   Cumulative incidence of IVB initiation at 12 months post-index was greatest for BC followed by PC and LC, and it declined with age in all tumor types, e.g., in BC from 62 % at age <50 years to 47 % at age ≥75 years. At 12 months, IVB treatment interruption ranged from 16 % (LC) to 31 % (PC), with discontinuation ranging from 46 % (BC) to 83 % (LC).  Conclusions:   IVBs are used more frequently in patients with BMets secondary to BC than PC or LC. Many patients interrupt or discontinue IVB therapy within 12 months of initiation potentially impacting effectiveness.""","""['May Hagiwara', 'Thomas E Delea', 'Ze Cong', 'Karen Chung']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Support Care Cancer""","""['Use of intravenous bisphosphonates in patients with breast, lung, or prostate cancer and metastases to bone: a 15-year study in two large US health systems.', 'Real-world use of denosumab and bisphosphonates in patients with solid tumours and bone metastases in Germany.', 'Natural history of skeletal-related events in patients with breast, lung, or prostate cancer and metastases to bone: a 15-year study in two large US health systems.', 'Bisphosphonates and other bone agents for breast cancer.', 'Bisphosphonates and other bone agents for breast cancer.', 'Incidence of Bone Metastases and Skeletal-Related Events in Patients With EGFR-Mutated NSCLC Treated With Osimertinib.', 'Beta tricalcium phosphate, either alone or in combination with antimicrobial photodynamic therapy or doxycycline, prevents medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw.', 'Reporting of Incidence and Outcome of Bone Metastases in Clinical Trials Enrolling Patients with Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Mutated Lung Adenocarcinoma-A Systematic Review.', 'Antiresorptive drug-related changes of the mandibular bone densitiy in medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw patients.', 'Treatment patterns of prostate cancer with bone metastasis in Beijing: A real-world study using data from an administrative claims database.']"""

However, most patients progress and become chemoresistant, which remains a major challenge in the management of advanced PCa. In this study, we investigated whether genistein, an isoflavone abundant in soy products, could sensitize mCRPC cells to cabazitaxel treatment in experimental models.  Methods:   The in vitro and in vivo effect of genistein in enhancing the response of mCRPC cells to cabazitaxel chemotherapy was evaluated in experimental models.  Results:   Genistein increases the expression of pro-apoptotic protein Bax, activates apoptotic signals, and enhances the response to cabazitaxel treatment in mCRPC cells. In a PC3-luciferase xenograft model, the combined treatment with genistein and cabazitaxel significantly retarded the growth of mCRPC when compared to vehicle control, cabazitaxel, or genistein. Tissue staining confirmed the in vivo effect of genistein on the induction of Bax and activation of apoptosis.  Conclusion:   This study provided the first preclinical evidence supporting that genistein could be beneficial in improving cabazitaxel chemotherapy in mCRPC.""","""['Shumin Zhang', 'Yanru Wang', 'Zhengjia Chen', 'Sungjin Kim', 'Shareen Iqbal', 'Andrew Chi', 'Chad Ritenour', 'Yongqiang A Wang', 'Omer Kucuk', 'Daqing Wu']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Cabazitaxel regimens inhibit the growth of prostate cancer cells and enhances the anti-tumor properties of PEDF with various efficacy and toxicity.', 'Lack of combination effects of soy isoflavones and taxane chemotherapy of castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Cabazitaxel Remains Active in Patients Progressing After Docetaxel Followed by Novel Androgen Receptor Pathway Targeted Therapies.', 'Taxane-based Combination Therapies for Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Progression of metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer: impact of therapeutic intervention in the post-docetaxel space.', 'Eprinomectin: a derivative of ivermectin suppresses growth and metastatic phenotypes of prostate cancer cells by targeting the β-catenin signaling pathway.', 'Chemopreventive Potential of Dietary Nanonutraceuticals for Prostate Cancer: An Extensive Review.', 'A Mini-Review of Flavone Isomers Apigenin and Genistein in Prostate Cancer Treatment.', 'Chitosan as possible inhibitory agents and delivery systems in leukemia.', 'Restraining the Proliferation of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Cells by Genistein through Up-regulation of B-cell Translocation Gene-3 at Transcription Level.']"""

Specifically, LH expression in PCa tissues has been associated with metastatic disease with a poor prognosis, while FSH has been shown to stimulate prostate cell growth in hormone-refractory PCa cell lines. Gonadotropin-realizing hormone (GnRH) analogues are common agents used for achieving androgen deprivation in the treatment for PCa. GnRH analogues include LH-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists and GnRH antagonists, both of which exhibit distinct mechanisms of action that may be crucial in terms of their overall clinical efficacy. LHRH agonists are typically used as the primary therapy for most patients and function via a negative-feedback mechanism. This mechanism involves an initial surge in testosterone levels, which may worsen clinical symptoms of PCa. GnRH antagonists provide rapid and consistent hormonal suppression without the initial surge in testosterone levels associated with LHRH agonists, thus representing an important therapeutic alternative for patients with PCa. The concentrations of testosterone and dihydrotestosterone are significantly reduced after treatment with both LHRH agonists and GnRH antagonists. This reduction in testosterone concentrations to castrate levels results in significant, rapid, and consistent reductions in prostatic-specific antigen, a key biomarker for PCa. Evidence suggests that careful maintenance of testosterone levels during androgen deprivation therapy provides a clinical benefit to patients with PCa, emphasizing the need for constant monitoring of testosterone concentrations throughout the course of therapy.""","""['Luis A Kluth', 'Shahrokh F Shariat', 'Christian Kratzik', 'Scott Tagawa', 'Guru Sonpavde', 'Malte Rieken', 'Douglas S Scherr', 'Karl Pummer']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""World J Urol""","""['Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) receptor agonists vs antagonists: a matter of the receptors?', 'Bench-to-bedside development of agonists and antagonists of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone for treatment of advanced prostate cancer.', 'A comparative study on the efficacies of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist and GnRH antagonist in neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy combined with transperineal prostate brachytherapy for localized prostate cancer.', 'The gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist abarelix depot versus luteinizing hormone releasing hormone agonists leuprolide or goserelin: initial results of endocrinological and biochemical efficacies in patients with prostate cancer.', 'Abarelix and other gonadotrophin-releasing hormone antagonists in prostate cancer.', 'Investigation of the GnRH antagonist degarelix isomerization in biological matrices.', 'Personalizing approaches to the management of metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer: role of advanced imaging, genetics and therapeutics.', 'The Association of Prostate Cancer and Urinary Tract Infections: A New Perspective of Prostate Cancer Pathogenesis.', 'Preclinical models of prostate cancer - modelling androgen dependency and castration resistance in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo.', 'Hypothalamic connectivities predict individual differences in ADT-elicited changes in working memory and quality of life in prostate cancer patients.']"""

Materials and methods:   Ethics board approval was received for this retrospective study of 87 men who underwent 1.5-Tesla conventional prostate MRI with a combination of endorectal and body phased-array coils for suspected prostate cancer before their first systematic 12-core TRUS-guided biopsy. Three radiologists independently analyzed the images, dividing the prostate into 12 regions corresponding to the biopsy scheme and scoring each region for the presence of prostate cancer on a 5-point scale. Results were analyzed by prostate region. ROC analysis was done and descriptive statistics were calculated. The negative predictive value, specificity, sensitivity and positive predictive value were calculated using dichotomized scores (benign tissue = scores of 1 and 2; malignant tissues = scores of 3, 4, and 5).  Results:   Biopsy revealed cancer in 47/87 patients (26 low-grade [Gleason score 6]; 21 high-grade [Gleason score ≥ 3 + 4]), and 184/1044 cores (77 low-grade and 107 high-grade) with a median of 3 positive cores per cancer patient (range 1 - 12). The areas under ROC curves were 0.65 - 0.67 for cancer detection by region overall and 0.75 - 0.76 for the detection of high-grade cancer by region. Statistic figures for the detection of all cancers/high-grade cancers by region were as follows: negative predictive value, 87.4 - 88.2 %/92.6 - 93.1 %; specificity, 72.3 - 79.4 %/71.5 - 79.8 %; sensitivity, 49.5 - 54.8 %/62.6 - 69.2 %; and positive predictive value, 29.3 - 34.0 %/29.4 - 34.7 %.  Conclusion:   In patients with suspected prostate cancer, negative MRI findings indicate the absence of high-grade prostate cancer on subsequent TRUS-guided 12-core biopsy with high probability.

A urethral warming catheter is placed to protect the prostatic urethra from cryo-injury. Thus tissue within certain depth beneath the urethral mucosa, including PCa in that zone, is not cryoablated. Preoperative predictors of PCa-to-urethra distance are important for urologists and patients to decide if undergoing cryoablation.  Methods:   A total of 267 consecutive radical prostatectomy specimens were reviewed by a pathologist and the shortest PCa-to-urethra distance was recorded as 0 (PCa at urethra), 0.1-1 mm, 1.1-2 mm, 2.1-3 mm, 3.1-4 mm, 4.1-5 mm and >5 mm. Preoperative serum PSA (iPSA) and prostate biopsy (Bx) parameters such as highest Bx Gleason score (BxGS), number of positive cores, highest percentage of PCa/cores, bilateral disease, perineural invasion (PNI) and PCa location were also recorded. The PCa-to-urethra distance subdivided into two (3 and >3 mm) and all seven categories was correlated with iPSA and Bx parameters. Logistic and linear regression were used to analyze the data.  Results:   Patients' median age and iPSA were 59 years and 5.28 ng ml(-1), respectively. PCa-to-urethra distance was <5 mm in 163 (61%) patients, 3 mm in 48% of patients. Significant univariate associations were found between shorter PCa-to-urethra distance and increasing iPSA (P<0.0001), BxGS (P=0.0016), number of positive cores (P< 0.0001), highest percentage of PCa/cores (P< 0.0001), bilateral disease (P=0.0003), PNI (P=0.01) and PCa detected in biopsies from apex (P< 0.0001), base (P=0.001) and base/medial base (P= 0.0006). In multivariate analysis, the iPSA (log), highest percentage of PCa/cores and PCa detected in the apex were significantly associated (P<0.0001) with both versions of PCa-to-urethra distance.  Conclusions:   Increasing iPSA, highest percentage of PCa/cores and PCa detected in the apex were associated with a shorter PCa-to-urethra distance. Inclusion of these preoperative parameters in a nomogram will help estimating the PCa-to-urethra distance and identifying better candidates for cryoablation.""","""['M M Padilha', 'J Stephen Jones', 'K Streator Smith', 'M Zhou', 'E Walker', 'C Magi-Galluzzi']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['External validation of the updated nomogram predicting lymph node invasion in patients with prostate cancer undergoing extended pelvic lymph node dissection.', 'The percent of cores positive for cancer in prostate needle biopsy specimens is strongly predictive of tumor stage and volume at radical prostatectomy.', 'Prostate needle biopsies: multiple variables are predictive of final tumor volume in radical prostatectomy specimens.', 'Cryotherapy III, bibliographic review.

Pain is a common and often severe pathological feature of cancers in bone, and is a significant impediment to the maintenance of quality of life of patients living with bone metastases. Cancer cell lines have been demonstrated to release significant amounts of the neurotransmitter and cell-signalling molecule l-glutamate via the system xC(-) cystine/glutamate antiporter. We have developed a novel mouse model of breast cancer bone metastases to investigate the impact of inhibiting cancer cell glutamate transporters on nociceptive behaviour. Immunodeficient mice were inoculated intrafemorally with the human breast adenocarcinoma cell line MDA-MB-231, then treated 14days later via mini-osmotic pumps inserted intraperitoneally with sulfasalazine, (S)-4-carboxyphenylglycine, or vehicle. Both sulfasalazine and (S)-4-carboxyphenylglycine attenuated in vitro cancer cell glutamate release in a dose-dependent manner via the system xC(-) transporter. Animals treated with sulfasalazine displayed reduced nociceptive behaviours and an extended time until the onset of behavioural evidence of pain. Animals treated with a lower dose of (S)-4-carboxyphenylglycine did not display this reduction in nociceptive behaviour. These results suggest that a reduction in glutamate secretion from cancers in bone with the system xC(-) inhibitor sulfasalazine may provide some benefit for treating the often severe and intractable pain associated with bone metastases.""","""['Robert G Ungard', 'Eric P Seidlitz', 'Gurmit Singh']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Pain""","""['The cystine/glutamate antiporter system xc- drives breast tumor cell glutamate release and cancer-induced bone pain.', 'xCT knockdown in human breast cancer cells delays onset of cancer-induced bone pain.', 'Inhibiting STAT3 in a murine model of human breast cancer-induced bone pain delays the onset of nociception.', 'Oxidative stress and cancer pain.', 'Glutamate receptors and nociception: implications for the drug treatment of pain.', 'Amino Acid Metabolism in Bone Metastatic Disease.', 'Ligand-Gated Ion Channels as Targets for Treatment and Management of Cancers.', 'Chronic Sulfasalazine Treatment in Mice Induces System xc - - Independent Adverse Effects.', 'Response to pregabalin and progesterone differs in male and female rat models of neuropathic and cancer pain.', 'Animal Models of Cancer-Related Pain: Current Perspectives in Translation.']"""

Exercise improves blood sugar regulation, and resistance exercise increases or maintains muscle mass and is associated with improved cognitive function. On the other hand, evidence for anti-oxidant supplements increasing longevity in humans is lacking. On the contrary, transient hormetic increases in reactive oxygen species (ROS), for example, associated with exercise, are actually associated with increased mammalian health span and life span. Recent studies in humans suggest that anti-oxidants such as vitamins C, E, resveratrol, and acetyl-N-cysteine blunt the beneficial effects of exercise on glucose sensitivity and blood sugar regulation, likely through direct inhibition of ROS signaling. Alternately, other studies suggest that vitamin C has beneficial effects on exercise-associated dysfunction, inhibiting exercise-induced bronchioconstriction. These data suggest that there are tradeoffs between potential benefits and harm from anti-oxidant dietary supplementation. Specific biomolecular interactions for each antioxidant also will be important. Omega-3 (n-3) polyunsaturated fattty acids (PUFAs) have anti-inflammatory activity that is not mediated through direct ROS inhibition. Although data are limited in humans, n-3 PUFAs do not seem to blunt blood sugar regulatory benefits of aerobic exercise and actually increase anabolic activity in skeletal muscle. However, another kind of tradeoff may exist with PUFAs, at least for men. A recent large clinical trial demonstrates an association of omega-3 fatty acids blood levels with increased incidence of prostate cancer, especially aggressive prostate cancer. Together these results suggest that there are significant tradeoffs in the use of dietary supplementation for prevention and treatment of diseases associated with aging. Such tradeoffs may result from underlying intertwined homeostatic mechanisms. For most individuals, moderate exercise is of significant benefit. Careful attention to individual and family medical history and personal genomic data may prove essential to make wise dietary and supplement choices to be combined with exercise.""","""['Andrew R Mendelsohn', 'James W Larrick']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Rejuvenation Res""","""['Response to exercise in older adults who take supplements of antioxidants and/or omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids: A systematic review.', 'A Randomized Trial of the Effects of Dietary n3-PUFAs on Skeletal Muscle Function and Acute Exercise Response in Healthy Older Adults.', 'Supplementation of omega 3 fatty acids improves oxidative stress in activated BV2 microglial cell line.', 'Effects of nutrients (in food) on the structure and function of the nervous system: update on dietary requirements for brain.

Genotyping of promoter polymorphisms was performed by bi-directional DNA sequencing, and for 894G>T by RFLP analysis. There was no significant association between the alleles and genotypes of these genetic variants and PCa risk. For -786T>C polymorphism, we found that C allele is associated with absence of metastases, assuming dominant genetic model (P = 0.049; OR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.25-1.00). It was found that, compared with NOS3 -690C>T variant CC genotype, CT and TT genotypes confer decreased risk of developing metastases (dominant model, P = 0.015, OR, 0.24; 95% CI, 0.07-0.88) and show association with low clinical tumour stage, compared with stages T3 and T4 (dominant model, P = 0.046, OR, 0.20; 95% CI, 0.04-1.02). Genetic variants -764A>G, -714G>T, -649G>A were not detected in our study group. There is evidence of an inverse correlation of the NOS3 894G>T minor allele with high serum PSA (>20 ng/ml) (dominant model, P = 0.013, OR, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.17-0.82).

Glycine N-methyltransferase (GNMT) is a S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransferase that has been recently identified as a novel androgen-regulated gene in prostate cancer cells. Although the importance of this protein in prostate cancer progression has been extensively addressed, little is known about the mechanism of its androgen regulation. Here, we show that GNMT expression is stimulated by androgen in androgen receptor (AR) expressing cells and that the stimulation occurs at the mRNA and protein levels. We have identified an androgen response element within the first exon of the GNMT gene and demonstrated that AR binds to this element in vitro and in vivo. Together, these studies identify GNMT as a direct transcriptional target of the AR. As this is an evolutionarily conserved regulatory element, this highlights androgen regulation as an important feature of GNMT regulation.""","""['Silvia Ottaviani', 'Greg N Brooke', ""Ciara O'Hanlon-Brown"", 'Jonathan Waxman', 'Simak Ali', 'Laki Buluwela']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Mol Endocrinol""","""['Androgen response element of the glycine N-methyltransferase gene is located in the coding region of its first exon.', 'c-Myc Antagonises the Transcriptional Activity of the Androgen Receptor in Prostate Cancer Affecting Key Gene Networks.', 'The important role of glycine N-methyltransferase in the carcinogenesis and progression of prostate cancer.', 'Androgen action in the prostate gland.', 'Molecular regulation of androgen action in prostate cancer.', 'Dual contribution of the mTOR pathway and of the metabolism of amino acids in prostate cancer.', 'The Integration of Metabolomics with Other Omics: Insights into Understanding Prostate Cancer.', 'PI3K-regulated Glycine N-methyltransferase is required for the development of prostate cancer.', 'Genome-wide association analysis reveals regulation of at-risk loci by DNA methylation in prostate cancer.', 'In Silico Prediction of Metabolic Fluxes in Cancer Cells with Altered S-adenosylmethionine Decarboxylase Activity.']"""

It is sometimes difficult to distinguish between a recurrent malignant lymph node and lymphadenopathy due to sarcoidosis in patients who develop lymphadenopathy after surgery for a malignant tumor.  Methods:   Between December 2009 and October 2012, we performed endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration in 13 selected patients with a suspected recurrence in the mediastinum and/or hilum of the lung after surgical resection of a malignant tumor. We examined their medical records to obtain information on the diagnosis, the sizes of lymph nodes, the number of needle passes and other complications.  Results:   Definitive diagnoses were made using endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration in 10 patients (three lung adenocarcinomas, one prostate carcinoma, one renal cell carcinoma, one neuroendocrine tumor and four sarcoidosis). Pathological specimens showing non-caseating granulomas led to the diagnosis of sarcoidosis in four patients; their previous malignancies had been papillary adenocarcinoma of the thyroid, carcinoma of the gingiva, thymoma and bladder cancer, but no recurrences were observed. The median of the longest diameter in 15 lymph nodes was 22 mm (range 13-35), and the median number of needle passes was two times (range 1-5) without severe complications.

Our analysis of serum samples also revealed the existence of hydroxylated metabolites of PCB11 in human blood. Because PCBs and PCB metabolites have been suggested to induce oxidative stress, this study sought to determine whether environmental exposure to PCB11 and its 4-hydroxyl metabolite could induce alterations in steady-state levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cytotoxicity in immortalized human prostate epithelial cells (RWPE-1). This study also examines if antioxidants could protect the cells from PCB11-induced cytotoxicity. Exponentially growing RWPE-1 cells were exposed to PCB11 and its metabolite, 3,3'-dichlorobiphenyl-4-ol (4-OH-PCB11), as well as an airborne PCB mixture resembling the Chicago ambient air congener profile, every day for 5 days. Results showed that 4-OH-PCB11 could significantly induce cell growth suppression and decrease the viability and plating efficiency of RWPE-1 cells. 4-OH-PCB11 also significantly increased steady-state levels of intracellular superoxide, O₂•⁻), as well as hydroperoxides. Finally, treatment with the combination of polyethylene glycol-conjugated CuZn superoxide dismutase and catalase added 1h after 4-OH-PCB11 exposures, significantly protected RWPE-1 cells from PCB toxicity. The results strongly support the hypothesis that exposure to a hydroxylated metabolite of PCB11 can inhibit cell proliferation and cause cytotoxicity by increasing steady-state levels of ROS. Furthermore, antioxidant treatments following PCBs exposure could significantly mitigate the PCB-induced cytotoxicity in exponentially growing human prostate epithelial cells.""","""['Yueming Zhu', 'Kranti A Mapuskar', 'Rachel F Marek', 'Wenjin Xu', 'Hans-Joachim Lehmler', 'Larry W Robertson', 'Keri C Hornbuckle', 'Douglas R Spitz', 'Nukhet Aykin-Burns']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Toxicol Sci""","""['Polychlorinated-biphenyl-induced oxidative stress and cytotoxicity can be mitigated by antioxidants after exposure.', 'Hydroxylated polychlorinated biphenyls increase reactive oxygen species formation and induce cell death in cultured cerebellar granule cells.', 'The fate of inhaled (14)C-labeled PCB11 and its metabolites in vivo.', 'Metabolism and metabolites of polychlorinated biphenyls.', 'A Critical Review of Polychlorinated Biphenyls Metabolism, Metabolites, and Their Correlation with Oxidative Stress.', 'Inadvertently Generated PCBs in Consumer Products: Concentrations, Fate and Transport, and Preliminary Exposure Assessment.', 'Dynamics of Metabolic Pathways and Stress Response Patterns during Human Neural Stem Cell Proliferation and Differentiation.', 'The influence of sex, genotype, and dose on serum and hippocampal cytokine levels in juvenile mice developmentally exposed to a human-relevant mixture of polychlorinated biphenyls.', ""3,3'-Dichlorobiphenyl Is Metabolized to a Complex Mixture of Oxidative Metabolites, Including Novel Methoxylated Metabolites, by HepG2 Cells."", 'Polychlorinated Biphenyls in Food.']"""

We evaluated how well a custom designed clinically deployable electrical property sensing biopsy needle is able to discriminate between these tissue types in an ex vivo prostate model.  Methods:   An electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) sensing biopsy (Bx) needle was developed to record resistive (ρR) and reactive (ρX) components of electrical impedance from 100 Hz to 1 MHz. Standard twelve-core biopsy protocols were followed, in which the EIS-Bx device was used to gauge electrical properties prior to extracting tissue cores through biopsy needle firing from 36 ex vivo human prostates. Histopathological assessment of the cores was statistically compared to the impedance spectrum gauged from each core.  Results:   The magnitudes of the mean resistive and reactive components were significantly higher in cancer tissues (P < 0.05). ROC curves showed that ρR at 63.09 kHz was optimal for discriminating cancer from benign tissues; this parameter had 75.4% specificity, 76.1% sensitivity, and ROC AUC of 0.779. Similarly, 251.1 kHz was optimal when using ρX to discriminate cancer from benign tissues; this parameter had a 77.9% specificity, 71.4% sensitivity, and ROC AUC of 0.79.  Conclusion:   Significant electrical property differences noted between benign and malignant prostate tissues suggest the potential efficacy an EIS-Bx device would provide for cancer detection in a clinical setting.

Although serum testosterone (T) is reduced by androgen deprivation therapy, intratumoral T levels in CRPC are comparable to those in prostate tissue of eugonadal men. These levels could originate from intratumoral conversion of adrenal androgens and/or from de novo steroid synthesis. However, the relative contribution of de novo steroidogenesis to AR-driven cell growth is unknown.  Methods:   The relative contribution of androgen biosynthetic pathways to activate androgen receptor (AR)-regulated cell growth and expression of PSA, FKBP5, and TMPRSS2 was studied at physiologically relevant levels of adrenal androgen precursors and intermediates of de novo androgen biosynthesis in human prostate cancer cell lines, PC346C, VCaP, and LNCaP.  Results:   In PC346C and VCaP, responses to pregnenolone and progesterone were absent or minimal, while large effects of adrenal androgen precursors were found. VCaP CRPC clones overexpressing CYP17A1 did not acquire an increased ability to use pregnenolone or progesterone to activate AR. In contrast, all precursors stimulated growth and gene expression in LNCaP cells, presumably resulting from the mutated AR in these cells.

Key points:   • Diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging is increasingly used to diagnose prostatic cancer • Reduced signal intensity (SI) on apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) mapping is characteristic • Prostatic tumours usually exhibit increased SI on high b-value images • But benign lesions can also yield increased SI on high b-value images.""","""['Michael Quentin', 'Lars Schimmöller', 'Christian Arsov', 'Robert Rabenalt', 'Gerald Antoch', 'Peter Albers', 'Dirk Blondin']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Eur Radiol""","""['Signal Intensity of High B-value Diffusion-weighted Imaging for the Detection of Prostate Cancer.', 'Prostate cancer vs. post-biopsy hemorrhage: diagnosis with T2- and diffusion-weighted imaging.', 'High-b-value diffusion-weighted MRI for the detection of prostate cancer at 3 T.', 'Evaluation of Diffusion Kurtosis Imaging Versus Standard Diffusion Imaging for Detection and Grading of Peripheral Zone Prostate Cancer.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Potential of diffusion-weighted imaging in magnetic resonance enterography to identify neoplasms in the ileocecal region: Use of ultra-high b-value diffusion-weighted imaging.', 'Usefulness of diffusion-weighted MR imaging for differentiating between benign and malignant superficial soft tissue tumours and tumour-like lesions.', 'Feasibility of multiparametric prostate magnetic resonance imaging in the detection of cancer distribution: histopathological correlation with prostatectomy specimens.', 'MR-sequences for prostate cancer diagnostics: validation based on the PI-RADS scoring system and targeted MR-guided in-bore biopsy.', 'Multiparametric MRI in prostate cancer management.']"""

Methods:   3 cohorts of 10 patients had different dietary interventions: no bowel preparation, high-fibre diet information leaflet and daily microenemas. The available cone beam CT (CBCT) scans of each patient were used to quantify interfractional changes in rectal distension (measured using average cross-sectional area-CSA), prostate shifts relative to bony anatomy compared with that at CT planning scan and rates of geometric miss (i.e. shifts of ≥5 mm). 85 CBCT scans were available in the pre-leaflet cohort, 89 scans in the post-leaflet, and 89 scans in the post-enema group.  Results:   Mean rectal CSA in the post-enema group was reduced compared with both pre-leaflet (p=0.010) and post-leaflet values (p=0.031). The magnitude of observed mean prostate shifts was significantly reduced in the post-enema group compared with the pre-leaflet group (p=0.014). The proportion of scans showing geometric miss (i.e. shift >5 mm) in the post-enema group (31%) was significantly lower than in the pre-leaflet (62%, p<0.001) or post-leaflet groups (56%, p<0.001).  Conclusion:   This study indicates microenema to be an effective measure to achieve reduction in rectal CSA, prostate shift and reduce geometric miss of ≥5 mm.

Methods:   RapidArc, 7-f IMRT and 9-f IMRT plans were created for 21 consecutive patients treated for high-risk prostate cancer using the Eclipse™ treatment planning system (Varian Medical Systems).

Target coverage and sparing of organs at risk (OARs) were compared across techniques. The total number of monitor units (MUs) and the treatment time were used to assess treatment delivery efficiency.  Results:   RapidArc resulted in slightly superior conformity and homogeneity of prostate PTV, whereas all plans were comparable with respect to dose to the nodal PTV.

AKR1C3 converts weaker 17-keto androgenic precursors to more potent 17-hydroxy androgens and is consistently the major upregulated gene in CRPC. The studies in the manuscript were undertaken to examine the role of AKR1C3 in AR function and CRPC.  Experimental design:   LNCaP cells stably transfected with AKR1C3 and VCaP cells endogenously expressing AKR1C3 were used to understand the effect of AKR1C3 on prostate cancer cell and tumor growth in nude mice. Chromatin immunoprecipitation, confocal microscopy, and co-immunoprecipitation studies were used to understand the recruitment of AKR1C3, intracellular localization of AKR1C3 and its interaction with AR in cells, tumor xenograft, and in Gleason sum 7 CRPC tissues. Cells were transiently transfected for AR transactivation. Novel small-molecule AKR1C3-selective inhibitors were synthesized and characterized in androgen-dependent prostate cancer and CRPC models.  Results:   We identified unique AR-selective coactivator- and prostate cancer growth-promoting roles for AKR1C3. AKR1C3 overexpression promotes the growth of both androgen-dependent prostate cancer and CRPC xenografts, with concomitant reactivation of androgen signaling. AKR1C3 interacted with AR in prostate cancer cells, xenografts, and in human CRPC samples and was recruited to the promoter of an androgen-responsive gene. The coactivator and growth-promoting functions of AKR1C3 were inhibited by an AKR1C3-selective competitive inhibitor.

Several splicing factors, including SAM68, have pro-oncogenic functions, and their increased expression often correlates with human cancer development and progression. Herein, we have identified using mass spectrometry proteins that interact with endogenous SAM68 in prostate cancer (PCa) cells. Among other interesting proteins, we have characterized the interaction of SAM68 with SND1, a transcriptional co-activator that binds spliceosome components, thus coupling transcription and splicing. We found that both SAM68 and SND1 are upregulated in PCa cells with respect to benign prostate cells. Upregulation of SND1 exerts a synergic effect with SAM68 on exon v5 inclusion in the CD44 mRNA. The effect of SND1 on CD44 splicing required SAM68, as it was compromised after knockdown of this protein or mutation of the SAM68-binding sites in the CD44 pre-mRNA. More generally, we found that SND1 promotes the inclusion of CD44 variable exons by recruiting SAM68 and spliceosomal components on CD44 pre-mRNA. Inclusion of the variable exons in CD44 correlates with increased proliferation, motility and invasiveness of cancer cells. Strikingly, we found that knockdown of SND1, or SAM68, reduced proliferation and migration of PCa cells. Thus, our findings strongly suggest that SND1 is a novel regulator of alternative splicing that promotes PCa cell growth and survival.""","""['M Cappellari', 'P Bielli', 'M P Paronetto', 'F Ciccosanti', 'G M Fimia', 'J Saarikettu', 'O Silvennoinen', 'C Sette']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['c-MYC empowers transcription and productive splicing of the oncogenic splicing factor Sam68 in cancer.', 'The RNA-binding and adaptor protein Sam68 modulates signal-dependent splicing and transcriptional activity of the androgen receptor.', 'Genotoxic stress causes the accumulation of the splicing regulator Sam68 in nuclear foci of transcriptionally active chromatin.', 'The RNA-binding protein Sam68 is a multifunctional player in human cancer.', 'RNA splicing and splicing regulator changes in prostate cancer pathology.', 'The RNA-binding protein Snd1/Tudor-SN regulates hypoxia-responsive gene expression.', 'Effectors and effects of arginine methylation.', 'Inhibition of SND1 overcomes chemoresistance in\xa0bladder cancer cells by promoting ferroptosis.', 'DNA Damage Regulates the Functions of the RNA Binding Protein Sam68 through ATM-Dependent Phosphorylation.', 'Inhibition of RNA Binding in SND1 Increases the Levels of miR-1-3p and Sensitizes Cancer Cells to Navitoclax.']"""

However, progression from HGPIN to invasive cancer occurs slowly, suggesting that tumorigenesis is subject to restraint. We show that Pten deletion, or constitutive activation of the downstream kinase AKT, activates the transforming growth factor (TGF)β pathway in prostate epithelial cells. TGFβ signaling is known to have a tumor suppressive role in many cancer types, and reduced expression of TGFβ receptors correlates with advanced human prostate cancer. We demonstrate that in combination either with loss of Pten or expression of constitutively active AKT1, inactivation of TGFβ signaling by deletion of the TGFβ type II receptor gene relieves a restraint on tumorigenesis. This results in rapid progession to lethal prostate cancer, including metastasis to lymph node and lung. In prostate epithelium, inactivation of TGFβ signaling alone is insufficient to initiate tumorigenesis, but greatly accelerates cancer progression. The activation of TGFβ signaling by Pten loss or AKT activation suggests that the same signaling events that have key roles in tumor initiation also induce the activity of a pathway that restrains disease progression.""","""['G A Bjerke', 'C-S Yang', 'H F Frierson', 'B M Paschal', 'D Wotton']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['TGFβ signaling limits lineage plasticity in prostate cancer.', 'Prostate cancer induced by loss of Apc is restrained by TGFβ signaling.', 'Inactivation of TGF-β signaling and loss of PTEN cooperate to induce colon cancer in vivo.', 'Interplay Among PI3K/AKT, PTEN/FOXO and AR Signaling in Prostate Cancer.', 'The TGF-beta, PI3K/Akt and PTEN pathways: established and proposed biochemical integration in prostate cancer.', 'Establishment and characterization of prostate organoids from treatment-naïve patients with prostate cancer.', 'Post-Transcriptional Regulation of PARP7 Protein Stability Is Controlled by Androgen Signaling.', 'Opposing roles and potential antagonistic mechanism between TGF-β and BMP pathways: Implications for cancer progression.', 'Deregulation of Negative Controls on TGF-β1 Signaling in Tumor Progression.', 'TGFβ signaling limits lineage plasticity in prostate cancer.']"""

Therefore, we examined whether an association exists between cytotoxicity and the metabolism of these drugs in cell lines from nine different tissues. Cytotoxicity studies using MTT [3-(4,5-dimethythiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide] cell viability assays revealed that four cell lines [HepG2 (liver), HCT-15 (colon), NCI-H460 (lung), and A-498 (kidney)] were more tolerant to DAUN and DOX than the five remaining cell lines [H9c2 (heart), PC-3 (prostate), OVCAR-4 (ovary), PANC-1 (pancreas), and MCF-7 (breast)], based on significantly higher LC50 values at incubation times of 6, 24, and 48 hours. Each cell line was also assessed for its efficiency at metabolizing DAUN and DOX. The four drug-tolerant cell lines converted DAUN/DOX to DAUNol/DOXol more rapidly than the five drug-sensitive cell lines. We also determined whether exposure to DAUN or DOX induced an increase in metabolic activity among any of these nine different cell types. All nine cell types showed a significant increase in their ability to metabolize DAUN or DOX in response to pre-exposure to the drug. Western blot analyses demonstrated that the increased metabolic activity toward DAUN and DOX correlated with a greater abundance of eight aldo-keto and two carbonyl reductases following exposure to either drug.

Although platinum(II)-based chemotherapy and other strategies grow in interest to treat castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), they still exhibit modest activity on CRPC and overall patient survival. In this study, we designed and prepared new combi-molecules using 17β-acetyl-testosterone and amino acid platinum(II) complexes linked at the position 7α to target and to improve the antiproliferative activity of platinum(II)-based chemotherapy on prostate cancer cells. Twelve chemical intermediates and six new combi-molecules were prepared and characterized.

Moreover, stereochemistry of the amino acid involved in the platinum complexes had only minor effects on the antiproliferative activity whereas pyridinyl (10a and b) and thiazolyl (10f) complexes exhibited the highest cytocidal activities that are significantly superior to that of cisplatin used as control on human prostate adenocarcinoma LNCaP (AR+), PC3 (AR-) and DU145 (AR-).

We demonstrate the feasibility of an automated multiplexing four-color quantum dot fluorophores in situ hybridization assay comprised of four genomic probes each labeled with unique haptens, four anti-hapten antibodies each conjugated with quantum dot fluorophores with distinct emission spectrum, protocols for their use on a fully automated tissue staining platform, and direct observation of multiple signals using conventional filter-based fluorescent microscopy.

The evidence of PDT efficacy for androgen-refractory prostate cancer will be especially meaningful for the patients resistant to hormone therapy.  Methods:   Pheophorbide a (PhA) as a photosensitizer was employed to evaluate the photodynamic efficacy in androgen-insensitive PC-3 prostate cancer cells in culture by cell viability assay, reactive oxygen species (ROS) measurement and cell cycle test. Characteristics of apoptosis and autophagy were investigated via DNA fragmentation electrophoresis and immune-fluorescence staining, acidic vesicle determination and detection of LC3B in puncta form by fluorescence microscopy, Western blotting of autophagy-related (Atg) proteins and detailed phenotype shown by electron microscopy.  Results:   PhA exerted significant photo-cytotoxicity toward androgen-insensitive prostate cancer PC-3 cells in photosensitizer-dose and light-dose dependent manners. The photoactivation immediately initiated hyperproduction of ROS, the depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential and the arrest of the cell cycle in the G0/G1 phase.

Material and methods:   A software platform was developed to achieve 3D co-registration. This software was prospectively applied to three patients who underwent radical prostatectomy. Data comprised in-vivo mpMRI [T2-weighted, dynamic contrast-enhanced weighted images (DCE); apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC)], ex-vivo T2-weighted imaging, 3D-rebuilt pathological specimen, and digital histology. Internal landmarks from zonal anatomy served as reference points for assessing co-registration accuracy and precision.  Results:   Applying a method of deformable transformation based on 22 internal landmarks, a 1.6 mm accuracy was reached to align T2-weighted images and the 3D-rebuilt pathological specimen, an improvement over rigid transformation of 32% (p = 0.003). The 22 zonal anatomy landmarks were more accurately mapped using deformable transformation than rigid transformation (p = 0.0008). An automatic method based on mutual information, enabled automation of the process and to include perfusion and diffusion MRI images. Evaluation of co-registration accuracy using the volume overlap index (Dice index) met clinically relevant requirements, ranging from 0.81-0.96 for sequences tested. Ex-vivo images of the specimen did not significantly improve co-registration accuracy.  Conclusion:   This preliminary analysis suggests that deformable transformation based on zonal anatomy landmarks is accurate in the co-registration of mpMRI and histology. Including diffusion and perfusion sequences in the same 3D space as histology is essential further clinical information.

Following chemical or surgical castration, prostate cancers usually shrink owing to testosterone deprivation. However, tumors often recur, forming castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Here, we show that CRPC sometimes expresses a gain-of-stability mutation that leads to a gain-of-function in 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (3βHSD1), which catalyzes the initial rate-limiting step in conversion of the adrenal-derived steroid dehydroepiandrosterone to DHT. The mutation (N367T) does not affect catalytic function, but it renders the enzyme resistant to ubiquitination and degradation, leading to profound accumulation. Whereas dehydroepiandrosterone conversion to DHT is usually very limited, expression of 367T accelerates this conversion and provides the DHT necessary to activate the AR.

Among the 376 patients treated with gentamicin, 160 mg infection rate was 2.7% (P = .27). The sepsis rate dropped significantly to 0.6% (P = .04) among the 169 patients who received 240 mg gentamicin during the biopsy.  Conclusion:   Addition of a single dose of gentamicin 240 mg resulted in a significant drop in infection rates after TRUS-PB. However, addition of 80 mg or 160 mg gentamicin had no significant effect on the infection rates.

These vesicles include both a common set of membrane and cytosolic proteins and origin-specific subsets of proteins that likely correlated to cell type-associated functions. To confirm the presence of EVs in the preparations, researchers have identified so-called EV marker proteins, including the tetraspanin family proteins and such cytosolic proteins as heat shock 70 kDa protein 4 (HSP70) and tumour susceptibility gene 101 (TSG101). However, studies have shown that some EV markers are not always present in all EVs, which not only complicates the identification of EVs but also precludes the quantitative evaluation of EV proteins. Thus, it is strongly required to explore well-conserved EV marker proteins that are present at similar levels, regardless of their tissue or cellular origin. In this study, we compared the presence of 11 well-known EV marker proteins by immunoblotting using EVs isolated from 4 human prostate cell lines and 5 human breast cell lines, including cancer cells with different phenotypes. We found that all the tested EVs were positive for CD9 and CD81, with similar abundance that was irrespective of the EV origin. In contrast, other EV marker proteins, such as TSG101, Rab-5b and CD63, were detected in an inconsistent manner, depending on the origin of the EVs.

Exposure to uranium and potentially carcinogenic chemicals was assessed with a plant-specific job-exposure matrix. Mortality hazard ratios (HRs) for cancers of the lung, lymphohematopoietic system, kidney and bladder, brain and central nervous system (BCNS), and prostate were estimated for each specific chemical exposure, with Cox regression models stratified for sex and calendar period and adjusted for socioeconomic status. Additional adjustments enabled us to examine the effect of co-exposure to uranium and other chemicals.  Results:   Exposure to aromatic solvents was associated with increased risk of BCNS malignancies after adjustment for other chemicals (HR=6.53, 95% CI=1.14-37.41; n=6) and for other chemicals and uranium (HR=7.26, 95% CI=0.90-58.19) in the annual exposure status model.

Adjusted risks of post-transplant cancer were analyzed using Cox proportional hazards regression model. All models were adjusted for baseline characteristics, comorbid diseases, transplant year, and exposure to immunosuppressive agents.  Results:   Among 642 renal transplant patients, 54 cancers (8.4 %) were identified. The median time between transplant and cancer diagnosis was 46.2 (range 8.5-107.4) months. Cancers of kidney and other unspecified urinary organs was the most common cancer sites, accounted for 18.5 % of the malignancies diagnosed. The next most common cancer sites were trachea, bronchus, and lung (14.8 %), bladder (13.0 %), liver and intrahepatic bile ducts (11.1 %), colon (5.6 %), and prostate (5.6 %). Age at transplantation was a statistically significant risk factor of post-transplant cancer in our study. Increased risks of post-transplant cancer were observed in patients who received immunosuppression agents (cyclosporine (HR 1.26, 95 % CI 0.58-2.77, p = 0.5603), tacrolimus (HR 1.99, 95 % CI 0.66-6.00, p = 0.2197), and mycophenolate (HR 1.00, 95 % CI 0.40-2.45, p = 0.9874)) although the estimates were not statistically significant.  Conclusions:   Our population-based cohort study offers additional insight into post-transplant cancers in Asian population. Further studies are warranted to assess the association between specific immunosuppression agents and post-transplant cancers.""","""['F Y Hsiao', 'W W Y Hsu']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Int Urol Nephrol""","""['The effect of maintenance immunosuppression medication on the change in kidney allograft function.', 'De Novo Malignancy After Heart, Kidney, and Liver Transplant: A Nationwide Study in Taiwan.', 'Renal cell cancer after kidney transplantation.', 'Impact of Mycophenolate Mofetil Dose Reduction on Allograft Outcomes in Kidney Transplant Recipients on Tacrolimus-Based Regimens: A Systematic Review.', 'Treatment strategies in pediatric solid organ transplant recipients with calcineurin inhibitor-induced nephrotoxicity.', 'Risk of Prostate Cancer in Chronic Kidney Disease Patient: A Meta-Analysis using Observational Studies.', 'Native Kidney Hydronephrosis Is Associated with Upper Urinary Tract Urothelial Carcinoma in Post-Kidney Transplantation Patients.', 'The effect of subsequent immunosuppressant use in organ-transplanted patients on prostate cancer incidence: a retrospective analysis using the Korean National Health Insurance Database.', 'Antitumor pharmacotherapy of colorectal cancer in kidney transplant recipients.', 'Gender differences in cancer risk after kidney transplantation.']"""

Aims:   To compare the cellular distribution and heterogeneity of PSA and PSMA expression in normal prostate (NP), benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and primary prostatic tumors and to analyze their relation with the angiogenic activity according to Gleason grade (low, medium and high) in primary PC.  Methods:   The study was carried out in 6 NP, 44 BPH and 39 PC. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed. Monoclonal antibodies 3E6 and ER-PR8 were used to assess PSMA and PSA expression respectively. The evaluation of angiogenesis was made by CD34 immune marker.  Results:   In our study we noticed differences in the intracellular localization of the PSMA immunostaining which seem to be related to the normal and pathological context. A significant number of primary tumors presented with apical pattern of PSMA (28/39); whereas a relevant part of NP samples and BPH samples showed cytoplasmic localization (4/6 and 30/44,respectively) in luminal epithelial cells. Compared to PSMA, PSA was preferentially localized in cytoplasmic compartment in all type of prostate. A direct correlation between histological grade, PSMA expression and angiogenic activity could be demonstrated in primary PC.  Conclusions:   Simultaneous stains with PSA and PSMA in individual prostate tissue will greatly improve the detection rate and identify a high risk PC that could progress to metastatic phenotype. Our findings clearly support the feasibility but also direct the potential of PSMA-targeted in vivo therapeutic approaches in PC patients rather than PSA especially those with poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma.""","""['Awatef Ben Jemaa', 'Yosra Bouraoui', 'Sataa Sallami', 'Ahmed Banasr', 'Yassine Nouira', 'Ali Horchani', 'Ridha Oueslati']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Tunis Med""","""['PSA-PSMA profiles and their impact on sera PSA levels and angiogenic activity in hyperplasia and human prostate cancer.', 'PSMA/PSA ratio evaluated by immunohistochemistry may improve diagnosis of prostate cancer.', 'PSMA-PSA clones controlled by full Akt phosphorylation (T308+,S473+) recapitulate molecular features of human prostate cancer.', 'Insight into the heterogeneity of prostate cancer through PSA-PSMA prostate clones: mechanisms and consequences.', 'Current Status of Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen Targeting in Nuclear Medicine: Clinical Translation of Chelator Containing Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen Ligands Into Diagnostics and Therapy for Prostate Cancer.', '177Lu-PSMA-RLT of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: limitations and improvements.', 'Correlation between Intraprostatic PSMA Uptake and MRI PI-RADS of 68GaGa-PSMA-11 PET/MRI in Patients with Prostate Cancer: Comparison of PI-RADS Version 2.0 and PI-RADS Version 2.1.', 'Establishing a novel prediction model for improving the positive rate of prostate biopsy.', 'Investigating PSMA-Targeted Radioligand Therapy Efficacy as a Function of Cellular PSMA Levels and Intratumoral PSMA Heterogeneity.', 'Diagnostic performance of 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT in the detection of prostate cancer prior to initial biopsy: comparison with cancer-predicting nomograms.']"""

Methods:   In this phase II open label study, eligible patients received IV temsirolimus at 25 mg weekly until objective disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or investigator's discretion. Toxicity was assessed every 4 weeks and responses every 8 weeks. Primary end point was calculating the overall response (OR) rate as well as measuring stable disease (SD) to assess the overall clinical benefit calculated as OR+SD. Secondary end points included prostatic-specific antigen (PSA) changes and time to progression biochemically and radiographically. Correlative studies included prospective assessment of quality of life (QoL) using two previously validated scales.  Results:   Although the sponsor halted the study early, 21 patients were enrolled of which, 15 were evaluable for efficacy and OR.

Objective:   To analyze 14 BCR definitions for their association with subsequent PSA and treatment progression among subgroups of patients at varying risk of prostate cancer-specific mortality.  Design, setting, and participants:   The subsequent risk of PSA and treatment progression after BCR based on 14 BCR definitions (six standard definitions and eight definitions requiring one or more successive PSA rises ≤0.1 ng/ml) was analyzed according to various clinicopathologic risk criteria among 2348 patients with a detectable PSA ≥0.03 ng/ml at least 6 wk after radical prostatectomy.  Intervention:   Radical prostatectomy.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Probability of subsequent PSA progression after BCR, defined as a PSA rise >0.1 ng/ml above BCR PSA, initiation of secondary treatment, or clinical progression.  Results and limitations:   Using standard BCR definitions, the risk of PSA progression was >70%, regardless of clinicopathologic features. A single PSA ≤0.1 ng/ml was associated with PSA progression in only 30-55% of patients but ranged from 18-25% to 73-88% for patients without and with adverse pathologic features, respectively. Based on discrimination and calibration analysis, the optimal BCR definition for patients with 5-yr progression-free probability of <50%, 50-75%, 76-90%, and >90% was a single PSA ≥0.05 ng/ml, two or more rising PSAs ≥0.05 ng/ml, PSA ≥0.2 ng/ml and rising, and PSA ≥0.4 ng/ml and rising.

Objective:   To determine the long-term effect of RP on male SF and EF over 10 yr of follow-up.  Design, setting, and participants:   This was a prospective, longitudinal outcomes study in 1836 men following RP at a university hospital. Men were invited to complete the University of California, Los Angeles, Prostate Cancer Index SF survey at baseline, 3, 6, 12, 24, 96, and 120 mo postoperatively and a survey at 4 and 7 yr postoperatively assessing global changes in their EF over the preceding 2 yr.  Intervention:   All men underwent open RP.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Multiple, generalized linear regression models were used to evaluate the association between time following RP and SF and EF scores controlling for age, prostate-specific antigen, Gleason scores, stage, nerve sparing, race, and marital status.  Results and limitations:   After an expected initial decline, time-dependent improvements in SF and EF were observed through 2 yr postoperatively. Overall, SF and EF were both generally stable between 2 and 10 yr following RP. The subgroups of younger men and men with better preoperative function were more likely to maintain their EF and SF through 10 yr following RP. The primary limitation is the potential bias attributable to nonresponders.  Conclusions:   The recovery of EF can extend well beyond 2 yr. There is a significant association between younger age and better preoperative function and the likelihood of experiencing improvements beyond 2 yr.

Therefore, an accurate delineation is a prerequisite for efficient treatment. Accurate automated prostate segmentation methods facilitate the delineation of the CTV without inter-observer variation. The purpose of this study is to present an automated three-dimensional (3D) segmentation of the prostate using an active appearance model.  Material and methods:   Axial T2-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) scans were used to build the active appearance model. The model was based on a principal component analysis of shape and texture features with a level-set representation of the prostate shape instead of the selection of landmarks in the traditional active appearance model. To achieve a better fit of the model to the target image, prior knowledge to predict how to correct the model and pose parameters was incorporated. The segmentation was performed as an iterative algorithm to minimize the squared difference between the target and the model image.  Results:   The model was trained using manual delineations from 30 patients and was validated using leave-one-out cross validation where the automated segmentations were compared with the manual reference delineations.

To do so, we carried out a randomized trial comparing hypofractionated and conventionally fractionated image-guided intensity modulated radiotherapy (IG-IMRT) in high-risk prostate cancer. Here, we report on acute toxicity and quality of life (QOL) for the first 124 randomized patients.  Methods:   The trial compares 76 Gy in 38 fractions (5 fractions/week) (Arm 1) to 63 Gy in 20 fractions (4 fractions/week) (Arm 2) (IG-IMRT). Prophylactic pelvic lymph node irradiation with 46 Gy in 23 fractions sequentially (Arm 1) and 44 Gy in 20 fractions simultaneously (Arm 2) was applied. All patients had long term androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) started before RT. Both physician-rated acute toxicity and patient-reported QOL using EPIC questionnaire are described.  Results:   There were no differences in overall maximum acute gastrointestinal (GI) or genitourinary (GU) toxicity. Compared to conventional fractionation (Arm 1), GI and GU toxicity both developed significantly earlier but also disappeared earlier in the Arm 2, reaching significant differences from Arm 1 at week 8 and 9. In multivariate analyses, only parameter shown to be related to increased acute Grade ≥1 GU toxicity was the study Arm 2 (p = 0.049). There were no statistically significant differences of mean EPIC scores in any domain and sub-scales. The clinically relevant decrease (CRD) in EPIC urinary domain was significantly higher in Arm 2 at month 1 with a faster recovery at month 3 as compared to Arm 1.  Conclusions:   Hypofractionation at 3.15 Gy per fraction to 63 Gy within 5 weeks was well tolerated.

Three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of prostate histology facilitates these registration-based evaluations by reintroducing 3D spatial information lost during histology processing. Because the reconstruction accuracy may constrain the clinical questions that can be answered with these data, it is important to assess the tradeoffs between minimally disruptive methods based on intrinsic image information and potentially more robust methods based on extrinsic fiducial markers.  Methods:   Ex vivo magnetic resonance (MR) images and digitized whole-mount histology images from 12 radical prostatectomy specimens were used to evaluate four 3D histology reconstruction algorithms. 3D reconstructions were computed by registering each histology image to the corresponding ex vivo MR image using one of two similarity metrics (mutual information or fiducial registration error) and one of two search domains (affine transformations or a constrained subset thereof). The algorithms were evaluated for accuracy using the mean target registration error (TRE) computed from homologous intrinsic point landmarks (3-16 per histology section; 232 total) identified on histology and MR images, and for the sensitivity of TRE to rotational, translational, and scaling initialization errors.  Results:   The algorithms using fiducial registration error and mutual information had mean ± standard deviation TREs of 0.7 ± 0.4 and 1.2 ± 0.7 mm, respectively, and one algorithm using fiducial registration error and affine transforms had negligible sensitivities to initialization errors. The postoptimization values of the mutual information-based metric showed evidence of errors due to both the optimizer and the similarity metric, and variation of parameters of the mutual information-based metric did not improve its performance.  Conclusions:   The extrinsic fiducial-based algorithm had lower mean TRE and lower sensitivity to initialization than the intrinsic intensity-based algorithm using mutual information. A model relating statistical power to registration error for certain imaging validation study designs estimated that a reconstruction algorithm with a mean TRE of 0.7 mm would require 27% fewer subjects than the method used to initialize the algorithms (mean TRE 1.3 ± 0.7 mm), suggesting the choice of reconstruction technique can have a substantial impact on the design of imaging validation studies, and on their overall cost.""","""['E Gibson', 'M Gaed', 'J A Gómez', 'M Moussa', 'C Romagnoli', 'S Pautler', 'J L Chin', 'C Crukley', 'G S Bauman', 'A Fenster', 'A D Ward']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Registration of prostate histology images to ex vivo MR images via strand-shaped fiducials.', 'Intraoperative fiducial-less patient registration using volumetric 3D ultrasound: a prospective series of 32 neurosurgical cases.', 'Assessment of image registration accuracy in three-dimensional transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy.', 'Algorithms for radiological image registration and their clinical application.', 'Histological Validation of MRI: A Review of Challenges in Registration of Imaging and Whole-Mount Histopathology.', 'Three-Dimensional Presentation of Tumor Histopathology: A Model Using Tongue Squamous Cell Carcinoma.', 'Optimized SIFTFlow for registration of whole-mount histology to reference optical images.', 'Computer-aided Detection of Prostate Cancer with MRI: Technology and Applications.', 'A Method for 3D Histopathology Reconstruction Supporting Mouse Microvasculature Analysis.']"""

Methods:   The system utilizes a comprehensive physics-based model to generate a series of predicted transit EPID image frames as a reference dataset and compares these to measured EPID frames acquired during treatment. The two datasets are using MLC aperture comparison and cumulative signal checking techniques. The system operation in real-time was simulated offline using previously acquired images for 19 IMRT patient deliveries with both frame-by-frame comparison and cumulative frame comparison. Simulated error case studies were used to demonstrate the system sensitivity and performance.  Results:   The accuracy of the synchronization method was shown to agree within two control points which corresponds to approximately ∼1% of the total MU to be delivered for dynamic IMRT.

The method is capable of producing arbitrary x-ray spectra by varying the pressure of the modulating gas and the peak kilovoltage (kVp) of the x-ray beams whose energy is being modulated.  Methods:   An aluminum chamber was machined with a 0.5 cm wall thickness, designed to withstand pressures of more than 80 atm. A pressure sensor and electrovalves were used to monitor and regulate the gas pressure. Argon was used as the modulating gas. A CdTe spectrometer was used to measure x-ray spectra for different combinations of kVp and gas pressure, thus obtaining a set of basis x-ray functions. An arbitrary x-ray spectrum can then be formed by the linear combination of such basis functions. In order to show one possible application of the modulation method, a contrast-enhanced radiotherapy prostate treatment was optimized with respect to the x-ray beam energy, without restrictions on the possible shape of the resultant x-ray spectra.  Results:   The x-ray spectra basis functions obtained display a smooth and gradual variation of their average energy as a function of the gas pressure for a given kVp, sometimes in the order of 1 or 2 keV. This gradual variation would be difficult to obtain with a conventional aluminum or copper filters, as the change in thickness necessary to reproduce the data presented would be in the order of micrometers, making necessary the use of a large number of such filters. Using the modulation method presented here, the authors were able to reconstruct the optimized x-ray spectra from the measured basis functions, for different optimization objectives.  Conclusions:   A method has been developed that allows for the controlled modulation of the energy contents of kilovoltage x-ray spectra. The method has been shown to be able to reproduce spectra of arbitrary shape, such as those obtained from the optimization of contrast-enhanced radiotherapy. The method may have other applications as well, such as in the precise matching of diagnostic x-ray catalog spectra.""","""['E L Facundo-Flores', 'H M Garnica-Garza']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Use of a laser-guided collimation system to perform direct kilovoltage x-ray spectra measurements on a linear accelerator onboard imager.', 'Treatment planning considerations in contrast-enhanced radiotherapy: energy and beam aperture optimization.', 'Feasibility of an image planning system for kilovoltage image-guided radiation therapy.', 'Monte Carlo modeling of converging small-field contrast-enhanced radiotherapy of prostate.', 'A monte carlo comparison of three different media for contrast enhanced radiotherapy of the prostate.']"""

However, a large disadvantage of using multiple atlases is the large computation time that is involved in registering atlas images to the target image. This paper aims to reduce the computation load of multiatlas-based segmentation by heuristically selecting atlases before registration.  Methods:   To be able to select atlases, pairwise registrations are performed for all atlas combinations. Based on the results of these registrations, atlases are clustered, such that each cluster contains atlas that registers well to each other. This can all be done in a preprocessing step. Then, the representatives of each cluster are registered to the target image. The quality of the result of this registration is estimated for each of the representatives and used to decide which clusters to fully register to the target image. Finally, the segmentations of the registered images are combined into a single segmentation in a label fusion procedure.  Results:   The authors perform multiatlas segmentation once with postregistration atlas selection and once with the proposed preregistration method, using a set of 182 segmented atlases of prostate cancer patients. The authors performed the full set of 182 leave-one-out experiments and in each experiment compared the result of the atlas-based segmentation procedure to the known segmentation of the atlas that was chosen as a target image. The results show that preregistration atlas selection is slightly less accurate than postregistration atlas selection, but this is not statistically significant.  Conclusions:   Based on the results the authors conclude that the proposed method is able to reduce the number of atlases that have to be registered to the target image with 80% on average, without compromising segmentation accuracy.""","""['Thomas R Langerak', 'Floris F Berendsen', 'Uulke A Van der Heide', 'Alexis N T J Kotte', 'Josien P W Pluim']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Multi-atlas segmentation of the whole hippocampus and subfields using multiple automatically generated templates.', 'Enhancing atlas based segmentation with multiclass linear classifiers.', 'Low-complexity atlas-based prostate segmentation by combining global, regional, and local metrics.', 'A review of atlas-based segmentation for magnetic resonance brain images.', 'Multi-atlas image registration of clinical data with automated quality assessment using ventricle segmentation.', 'Deep convolutional neural network for hippocampus segmentation with boundary region refinement.', 'Auto-segmentation for total marrow irradiation.', 'Automated major psoas muscle volumetry in computed tomography using machine learning algorithms.', 'Machine Learning for Head and Neck Cancer: A Safe Bet?-A Clinically Oriented Systematic Review for the Radiation Oncologist.', 'Automated Motion Analysis of Bony Joint Structures from Dynamic Computer Tomography Images: A Multi-Atlas Approach.']"""

To identify a molecular signature reflective of the downstream effects of ERG-mediated transcriptional regulation with prognostic implication in patients with prostate cancer (PCA).  Material and methods:   We used a singular value decomposition (SVD) bioinformatics approach to re-analyse gene expression data previously generated from 46 prostate tumours, and identified an ERG-like gene signature. The signature was validated on several patient cohorts and individual genes were correlated to ERG expression and PCA progression.  Results:   An ERG-like 10-gene signature was identified and validated in PCA cohorts of the physician health study (p115) (n = 110) in addition to three independent public datasets, and was significantly associated with disease progression, biochemical recurrence and PCA-specific mortality. Patients with the ERG-like signature were significantly associated with disease recurrence on univariate (hazard ratio [HR] 2.6; 95% confidence interval [CI]:1.3-5.2; P = 0.004) and multivariate analysis (HR 2.3; 95% CI:1.1-4.6, P = 0.016) compared with patients without this signature. Within the group of patients with Gleason score (GS) 6 and 7 PCA, the signature added prognostic value beyond GS and identified patients at higher risk of cancer deaths more accurately than GS alone or in combination with ERG status. Protein expression of the 10 genes were significantly associated with ERG and disease progression regardless of ERG status.  Conclusion:   The characterized ERG-like signature was reflective of aggressive features of ERG-mediated transcription and was prognostically robust. The combination of this signature with clinicopathological variables should be validated prospectively to explore its clinical utility in stratifying patients with PCA and in identifying those at higher risk of metastatic and lethal disease.""","""['Tarek A Bismar', 'Mohammed Alshalalfa', 'Lars F Petersen', 'Liang Hong Teng', 'Travis Gerke', 'Ashraf Bakkar', 'Amal Al-Mami', 'Shuhong Liu', 'Michael Dolph', 'Lorelei A Mucci', 'Reda Alhajj']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['ERG protein expression reflects hormonal treatment response and is associated with Gleason score and prostate cancer specific mortality.', 'Characterization of 1577 primary prostate cancers reveals novel biological and clinicopathologic insights into molecular subtypes.', 'PTEN genomic deletion is an early event associated with ERG gene rearrangements in prostate cancer.', 'ERG expression in prostate cancer: biological relevance and clinical implication.', 'Dangerous liaisons in prostate cancer.

This finding increases risk of recurrence and cancer-specific mortality. Validated clinical tools that are available preoperatively are needed to improve the ability to recognize likelihood of upgrading in patients with low-risk PC.  Methods:   More than 30 clinicopathologic parameters were assessed in consecutive patients with Gleason 6 PC upon biopsy who underwent radical prostatectomy. A nomogram for predicting upgrading (Gleason ≥ 7) on final pathology was generated using multivariable logistic regression in a development cohort of 431 patients. External validation was performed in 2 separate cohorts consisting of 1151 patients and 392 patients. Nomogram performance was assessed using receiver operating characteristic curves, calibration, and decision analysis.  Results:   On multivariable analysis, variables predicting upgrading were prostate-specific antigen density using ultrasound (odds ratio [OR] = 229, P = .003), obesity (OR = 1.90, P = .05), number of positive cores (OR = 1.23, P = .01), and maximum core involvement (OR = 0.02, P = .01). On internal validation, the bootstrap-corrected predictive accuracy was 0.753. External validation revealed a predictive accuracy of 0.677 and 0.672. The nomogram demonstrated excellent calibration in all 3 cohorts and decision curves demonstrated high net benefit across a wide range of threshold probabilities. The nomogram demonstrated areas under the curve of 0.597 to 0.672 for predicting upgrading in subsets of men with very low-risk PC who meet active surveillance criteria (all P < .001), allowing further risk stratification of these individuals.

The same approaches were used to analyze the effects of external migration stimuli, actin polymerization inhibitors or deletion of the isoform-specific amino- and/or carboxy termini on cell migration and actin bundle formation. Results indicate that the termini of the myopodin isoforms differentially alter the formation of morphologically distinct F-actin networks that also differ in their myosin and myopodin staining patterns. Furthermore, enhanced cell migration was reduced by >50% when actin bundle formation was impaired by myopodin-truncation, low concentrations of an actin polymerization inhibitor, or in the absence of an external migration stimulus.

To explore this provocative concept, we derived androgen-sensitive and -insensitive prostate epithelial cells persistently infected with human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8), an oncogenic herpesvirus that has been detected in normal prostate epithelium, prostate adenocarcinoma, and biologic fluids of patients with prostate cancer, to explore its effects on transition to hormone-refractory disease. Strikingly, we found that HHV-8 infection of androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cells conferred the capacity for androgen-independent growth. This effect was associated with altered expression and transcriptional activity of the androgen receptor (AR). However, HHV-8 infection bypassed AR signaling by promoting enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2)-mediated epigenetic silencing of tumor-suppressor genes, including MSMB and DAB2IP that are often inactivated in advanced disease. Furthermore, we found that HHV-8 triggered epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Although HHV-8 has not been linked etiologically to prostate cancer, virologic outcomes revealed by our study provide mechanistic insight into how intraprostatic infections could constitute risk for progression to androgen-independent metastatic disease where EZH2 has been implicated.

Although antioxidant activity is commonly associated with direct radical scavenging activity, an alternative way to increase the antioxidant status of a cell is to enhance the endogenous (phase II) defense system consisting of cytoprotective antioxidant enzymes, including NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1). These enzymes are transcriptionally regulated by the antioxidant response element (ARE) via the transcription factor Nrf2. Extracts derived from cultivated Ulva sp., a green alga regarded as a marine vegetable (sea lettuce), potently activated the Nrf2-ARE pathway in IMR-32 neuroblastoma and LNCaP prostate cancer cells. RNA interference studies showed that Nrf2 and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) are essential for the phase II response in IMR-32 cells. Activity-enriched fractions induced Nrf2 nuclear translocation and target gene transcription, and boosted the cellular glutathione level and therefore antioxidant status. A single-dose gavage feeding of Ulva-derived fractions increased Nqo1 transcript levels in various organs. Nqo1 induction spiked in different tissues, depending on the specific chemical composition of each administered fraction.

This paper investigates how the number of PSA tests has developed over time in Norwegian counties, and relates this development to the incidence of cancer in the various counties and the rates of prostate cancer surgery.  Method:   Data on incidence, survival and mortality were obtained from public registers. The numbers of PSA tests carried out were acquired from Norwegian laboratories. The PSA testing rates per county and correlation with prostate cancer incidence rates and surgery rates were surveyed. Developments in Sogn og Fjordane, which has the highest incidence of prostate cancer in Norway, were examined separately. A net-based survey of primary doctors' attitudes and practice was carried out.  Results:   The number of PSA tests increased substantially in the period 1999-2011 and in 2011 corresponded to testing of 45% of the total male population aged over 40 in Norway. The number of PSA tests in 2011 correlated with the incidence by county of prostate cancer in the previous period (Pearson's r = 0.41). The correlation between the incidence of cancer and surgical procedures was 0.66. In Sogn og Fjordane, the prostate cancer incidence and survival are rising steeply, while mortality is at the same level as in Norway generally. Primary doctors often comply with their patients' wish for PSA testing and find it difficult not to refer them to specialists if values are elevated.  Interpretation:   There is probably a correlation between the increased incidence of prostate cancer and the amount of PSA testing. Compliance with the guidelines for testing should be better and clinicians could practice more watchful waiting with regard to further treatment in cases of elevated PSA values.""","""['Hans Johan Breidablik', 'Eivind Meland', 'Kristin Moberg Aakre', 'Olav Helge Førde']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Tidsskr Nor Laegeforen""","""['Overuse of PSA testing in healthy men.', 'Re: PSA measurement and prostate cancer--overdiagnosis and overtreatment?.', ""Factors influencing primary care physicians' decision to order prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test for men without prostate cancer."", 'Timely screening routines for prostatic cancer by Norwegian physicians.', 'Discrepancies between guidelines and clinical practice regarding prostate-specific antigen testing.', 'Prostate-specific antigen tests and prostate cancer screening: an update for primary care physicians.', 'Focus on the screening for prostate cancer by PSA.', ""Men's perception of information and psychological distress in the diagnostic phase of prostate cancer: a comparative mixed methods study."", ""General practitioners' reflections on using PSA for diagnosis of prostate cancer.

Both tasks entail a substantial coding effort and demand advanced knowledge of the intricacies of the Monte Carlo system being used.  Methods:   PRIMO, a new Monte Carlo system that allows the effortless simulation of most Varian and Elekta linacs, including their multileaf collimators and electron applicators, is introduced. PRIMO combines (1) accurate physics from the PENELOPE code, (2) dedicated variance-reduction techniques that significantly reduce the computation time, and (3) a user-friendly graphical interface with tools for the analysis of the generated data. PRIMO can tally dose distributions in phantoms and computerized tomographies, handle phase-space files in IAEA format, and import structures (planning target volumes, organs at risk) in the DICOM RT-STRUCT standard.  Results:   A prostate treatment, conformed with a high definition Millenium multileaf collimator (MLC 120HD) from a Varian Clinac 2100 C/D, is presented as an example. The computation of the dose distribution in 1.86×3.00×1.86 mm3 voxels with an average 2% standard statistical uncertainty, performed on an eight-core Intel Xeon at 2.67 GHz, took 1.8 h-excluding the patient-independent part of the linac, which required 3.8 h but it is simulated only once.  Conclusion:   PRIMO is a self-contained user-friendly system that facilitates the Monte Carlo simulation of dose distributions produced by most currently available linacs.

However, recent studies have reported increased adverse events and/or reduced survival in patients receiving both EPO and chemotherapy, potentially related to EPO-induced cancer progression. Additional preclinical studies that elucidate the possible mechanism underlying EPO cellular growth stimulation are needed.  Methods:   Using commercial tissue microarray (TMA) of a variety of cancers and benign tissues, EPO and EPO receptor immunohistochemical staining was performed. Furthermore using a panel of human renal cells (Caki-1, 786-O, 769-P, RPTEC), in vitro and in vivo experiments were performed with the addition of EPO in normoxic and hypoxic states to note phenotypic and genotypic changes.  Results:   EPO expression score was significantly elevated in lung cancer and lymphoma (compared to benign tissues), while EPOR expression score was significantly elevated in lymphoma, thyroid, uterine, lung and prostate cancers (compared to benign tissues). EPO and EPOR expression scores in RCC and benign renal tissue were not significantly different. Experimentally, we show that exposure of human renal cells to recombinant EPO (rhEPO) induces cellular proliferation, which we report for the first time, is further enhanced in a hypoxic state. Mechanistic investigations revealed that EPO stimulates the expression of cyclin D1 while inhibiting the expression of p21cip1 and p27kip1 through the phosphorylation of JAK2 and ERK1/2, leading to a more rapid progression through the cell cycle. We also demonstrate an increase in the growth of renal cell carcinoma xenograft tumors when systemic rhEPO is administered.

Many questions about its implementation, safety, and number of procedures required to achieve competence and improvement of outcomes with the technique remain unclear, and a learning curve study is crucial to investigate the acceptable performance of this advanced, minimally invasive procedure.  Subjects and methods:   Between 2004 and 2011, 240 consecutive patients underwent an LRP performed by a single surgeon and were divided into the first, second, and third groups of 80 patients each. Perioperative and oncologic outcomes were compared across the groups to assess the impact of the learning curve for LRP. All surgical complications were classified using the Clavien-Dindo system (CDS).  Results:   Mean (range) patient age was 61 (43-78) years. The mean (range) level of prostate-specific antigen was 6.47 (3-18) ng/mL. The mean (range) Gleason sum was 6 (5-9). There was a significant reduction in the mean operative time (P<.001), mean anastomosis time (P<.001), mean blood loss (P<.001), mean hospital stay (P<.001), and mean minor CDS complications (P<.01) among the three groups as the series progressed. The D'Amico tumor stage was an independent factor for positive surgical margin across the learning curve (P<.001).  Conclusions:   Our study demonstrated safety and low morbidity of the LRP technique since the beginning of a learning curve development, in which up to 80 cases were necessary to create a plateau to improve faster perioperative parameters, although, from the plateau created, it requires a very large number of surgeries for slightly better, additional overall benefits. In spite of its complexity and steep learning curve, new surgeons can be encouraged in the LRP technique with mentorship training without compromising overall outcomes, permitting the wide spread of an alternative minimally invasive procedure in low-volume centers.""","""['Ricardo F Di Gioia', 'Mauricio Rubinstein', 'Luciane Velasque', 'Irineu Rubinstein']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Laparoendosc Adv Surg Tech A""","""['Developing a laparoscopic radical prostatectomy service: defining the learning curve.', 'Evaluating the learning curve of experienced laparoscopic surgeons in robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', ""The first 1000 cases of laparoscopic radical prostatectomy in the UK: evidence of multiple 'learning curves'."", 'Long-term oncological outcomes after laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.', 'Laparoscopic radical prostatectomy: is it feasible and reasonable?', 'The learning curves of major laparoscopic and robotic procedures in urology: a systematic review.', 'Learning curves in laparoscopic and robot-assisted prostate surgery: a systematic search and review.', 'Editorial Comment: Training of Brazilian urology residents in laparoscopy: results of a national survey.', 'The influence of previous robotic experience in the initial learning curve of laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.', '4-Ports endoscopic extraperitoneal radical prostatectomy: preliminary and learning curve results.']"""

Among such processes is chromatin remodeling via histone proteins, controlled by opposing histone deacetylase (HDAC) and histone acetyltransferase (HAT) enzymes. Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) show great promise in preclinical cancer models, but clinical trials treating solid tumors have failed to improve patient survival. This is due in part to an inability of HDACi to effectively accumulate in cancerous cells. To address this problem we designed HDACi with secondary pharmacophores to facilitate selective accumulation in malignant cells. We present the first example of HDACi compounds targeted to prostate tumors by equipping them with the additional ability to bind the androgen receptor (AR) with nonsteroidal antiandrogen moieties. Leads among these new dual-acting molecules bind to the AR and halt AR transcriptional activity at lower concentrations than clinical antiandrogens. They inhibit key isoforms of HDAC with low nanomolar potency. Fluorescent microscopy reveals varying degrees of AR nuclear localization in response to these compounds that correlates with their HDAC activity. These biological properties translate into potent anticancer activity against hormone-dependent (AR+) LNCaP and to a lesser extent against hormone-independent (AR-) DU145 prostate cancer, while having greatly reduced toxicity in noncancerous cells. This illustrates that engaging multiple biological targets with a single chemical probe can achieve both potent and cell-type-selective responses.""","""['Berkley E Gryder', 'Michelle J Akbashev', 'Michael K Rood', 'Eric D Raftery', 'Warren M Meyers', 'Paulette Dillard', 'Shafiq Khan', 'Adegboyega K Oyelere']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""ACS Chem Biol""","""['Hybrid Enzalutamide Derivatives with Histone Deacetylase Inhibitor Activity Decrease Heat Shock Protein 90 and Androgen Receptor Levels and Inhibit Viability in Enzalutamide-Resistant C4-2 Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Targeting prostate cancer cells with enzalutamide-HDAC inhibitor hybrid drug 2-75.', 'Formation of AR-SMRT binding in prostate cancer cells treated with natural histone deacetylase inhibitor.', 'Improving Strategies in the Development of Protein-Downregulation-Based Antiandrogens.', 'Antiandrogens in prostate cancer endocrine therapy.', 'Antiandrogen-Equipped Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors Selectively Inhibit Androgen Receptor (AR) and AR-Splice Variant (AR-SV) in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC).', 'Epigenetics in prostate cancer: clinical implications.', 'Shifting the paradigm in treating multi-factorial diseases: polypharmacological co-inhibitors of HDAC6.', 'Discovery of a novel AR/HDAC6 dual inhibitor for prostate cancer treatment.', 'Liver-Targeting Class I Selective Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors Potently Suppress Hepatocellular Tumor Growth as Standalone Agents.']"""

This needs to incorporate clinically related organ specific constraints, Monte Carlo (MC) dose calculations, and large-scale plan optimization. This paper describes our first steps toward a web-based real-time radiation treatment planning system in a cloud computing environment (CCE). The Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) with a master node (named m2.xlarge containing 17.1 GB of memory, two virtual cores with 3.25 EC2 Compute Units each, 420 GB of instance storage, 64-bit platform) is used as the backbone of cloud computing for dose calculation and plan optimization. The master node is able to scale the workers on an 'on-demand' basis. MC dose calculation is employed to generate accurate beamlet dose kernels by parallel tasks. The intensity modulation optimization uses total-variation regularization (TVR) and generates piecewise constant fluence maps for each initial beam direction in a distributed manner over the CCE. The optimized fluence maps are segmented into deliverable apertures. The shape of each aperture is iteratively rectified to be a sequence of arcs using the manufacture's constraints. The output plan file from the EC2 is sent to the simple storage service. Three de-identified clinical cancer treatment plans have been studied for evaluating the performance of the new planning platform with 6 MV flattening filter free beams (40 × 40 cm(2)) from the Varian TrueBeam(TM) STx linear accelerator. A CCE leads to speed-ups of up to 14-fold for both dose kernel calculations and plan optimizations in the head and neck, lung, and prostate cancer cases considered in this study. The proposed system relies on a CCE that is able to provide an infrastructure for parallel and distributed computing. The resultant plans from the cloud computing are identical to PC-based IMRT and VMAT plans, confirming the reliability of the cloud computing platform. This cloud computing infrastructure has been established for a radiation treatment planning. It substantially improves the speed of inverse planning and makes future on-treatment adaptive re-planning possible.""","""['Yong Hum Na', 'Tae-Suk Suh', 'Daniel S Kapp', 'Lei Xing']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['A comprehensive formulation for volumetric modulated arc therapy planning.', 'Treatment plan comparison between helical tomotherapy and MLC-based IMRT using radiobiological measures.', 'Moving GPU-OpenCL-based Monte Carlo dose calculation toward clinical use: Automatic beam commissioning and source sampling for treatment plan dose calculation.', 'Direct aperture optimization as a means of reducing the complexity of Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy plans.', 'Planning and delivery of intensity-modulated radiation therapy.', 'Internet-based computer technology on radiotherapy.', 'Use of proximal operator graph solver for radiation therapy inverse treatment planning.', 'A scoping review of cloud computing in healthcare.']"""

Accompanied with the knockdown of PTPRK, increased expression of caspase-3, caspase-8 and p53, and a decreased ID1 expression were evident in the cells. Furthermore, an increased tyrosine phosphorylated c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) was seen in the PTPRK knockdown cells. The effect on apoptosis was diminished by a JNK inhibitor. In conclusion, PTPRK knockdown resulted in increased apoptosis leading to the inhibition of in vitro growth of prostate cancer cells. PTPRK is a key factor in coordinating apoptosis via the regulation of MAPK pathways, in particular the JNK pathway in prostate cancer cells.""","""['Ping-Hui Sun', 'Lin Ye', 'Malcolm D Mason', 'Wen G Jiang']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Int J Oncol""","""['Inhibition of JNK-1 by small interfering RNA induces apoptotic signaling in PC-3 prostate cancer cells.', 'PTPRK negatively regulates transcriptional activity of wild type and mutated oncogenic beta-catenin and affects membrane distribution of beta-catenin/E-cadherin complexes in cancer cells.', 'The mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase vaccinia H1-related protein inhibits apoptosis in prostate cancer cells and is overexpressed in prostate cancer.', 'Mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase 1 is overexpressed in prostate cancers and is inversely related to apoptosis.', 'The role of JNK in prostate cancer progression and therapeutic strategies.', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases: Mechanisms in Cancer.', 'OPN promotes the aggressiveness of non-small-cell lung cancer cells through the activation of the RON tyrosine kinase.', 'Protein tyrosine phosphatases: promising targets in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.', 'PTPRK suppresses progression and chemo-resistance of colon cancer cells via direct inhibition of pro-oncogenic CD133.', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases as Potential Regulators of STAT3 Signaling.']"""

ARN-509 inhibits AR nuclear translocation and AR binding to androgen response elements and, unlike bicalutamide, does not exhibit agonist properties in the context of AR overexpression. This first-in-human phase I study assessed safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and antitumor activity of ARN-509 in men with metastatic CRPC.  Patients and methods:   Thirty patients with progressive CRPC received continuous daily oral ARN-509 at doses between 30 and 480 mg, preceded by administration of a single dose followed by a 1-week observation period with pharmacokinetic sampling. Positron emission tomography/computed tomography imaging was conducted to monitor [(18)F]fluoro-α-dihydrotestosterone (FDHT) binding to AR in tumors before and during treatment. Primary objective was to determine pharmacokinetics, safety, and recommended phase II dose.  Results:   Pharmacokinetics were linear and dose proportional. Prostate-specific antigen declines at 12 weeks (≥ 50% reduction from baseline) were observed in 46.7% of patients. Reduction in FDHT uptake was observed at all doses, with a plateau in response at ≥ 120-mg dose, consistent with saturation of AR binding. The most frequently reported adverse event was grade 1/2 fatigue (47%). One dose-limiting toxicity event (grade 3 abdominal pain) occurred at the 300-mg dose. Dose escalation to 480 mg did not identify a maximum-tolerated dose.  Conclusion:   ARN-509 was safe and well tolerated, displayed dose-proportional pharmacokinetics, and demonstrated pharmacodynamic and antitumor activity across all dose levels tested. A maximum efficacious dose of 240 mg daily was selected for phase II exploration based on integration of preclinical and clinical data.""","""['Dana E Rathkopf', 'Michael J Morris', 'Josef J Fox', 'Daniel C Danila', 'Susan F Slovin', 'Jeffrey H Hager', 'Peter J Rix', 'Edna Chow Maneval', 'Isan Chen', 'Mithat Gönen', 'Martin Fleisher', 'Steven M Larson', 'Charles L Sawyers', 'Howard I Scher']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Clin Oncol""","""['ARN-509: a novel antiandrogen for prostate cancer treatment.', 'Activity and safety of SHR3680, a novel antiandrogen, in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: a phase I/II trial.', 'Phase 2 Study of the Safety and Antitumor Activity of Apalutamide (ARN-509), a Potent Androgen Receptor Antagonist, in the High-risk Nonmetastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer Cohort.', 'Androgen receptor antagonists in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Apalutamide: the established and emerging roles in the treatment of advanced prostate cancer.', 'Metabolism-Guided Selective Androgen Receptor Antagonists: Design, Synthesis, and Biological Evaluation for Activity against Enzalutamide-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Prostate Cancer-PET Imaging Update.', 'Nuclear Receptor Imaging In Vivo-Clinical and Research Advances.', 'Comprehensive clinical evaluation of CAR-T cell immunotherapy for solid tumors: a path moving forward or a dead end?', 'Simulating androgen receptor selection in designer yeast.']"""

Accuracy was defined by the proportions of patients with an observed survival time bounded by prespecified multiples of their estimated survival time. We expected 50% to live longer (or shorter) than their oncologist's estimate (calibration), 50% to live from half to double their estimate (typical scenario), 5% to 10% to live ≤ one quarter of their estimate (worst-case scenario), and 5% to 10% to live three or more times their estimate (best-case scenario). Estimates within 0.67 to 1.33 times observed survival were deemed precise. Discriminative value was assessed with Harrell's C-statistic and prognostic significance with proportional hazards regression.  Results:   Median survival time was 11 months.

Because there is no documented consensus supporting any one of the primary treatment modalities-surgery, external beam radiation, and brachytherapy-over the others, patient and physician preferences can significantly influence treatment approach. This can lead to substantial variation in treatment practices at the level of individual hospitals. In this context, it is informative for individual hospitals, especially small community hospitals that lack substantial quality assurance resources, to compare their prostate cancer care to that provided by cohort groups of hospitals. This study compares prostate cancer treatment modalities at Falmouth Hospital (FH), a 95-bed community hospital located in Falmouth, Massachusetts, to those at hospitals in 3 cohort groups: 1) US hospitals of all types, 2) Massachusetts hospitals of all types, and 3) Massachusetts community hospitals. It also compares survival outcomes for FH prostate cancer patients to national averages. All data for these comparisons were obtained from the National Cancer Data Base (NCDB) Hospital Comparison Benchmark Reports and Survival Reports applications. This study's main finding is that FH performed markedly less surgery and more radiation, specifically brachytherapy, than the cohort groups of hospitals.

The effective design, implementation, and evaluation of such programs require population-based cancer registries. Ghana's second largest medical center, the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital (KATH) in Kumasi, has made initial progress at developing a cancer registry. This registry, however, is housed in the medical oncology/radiotherapy center at KATH and does not currently include data from other departments that also interact with cancer patients. The aim of this study was to improve KATH cancer registration by compiling cancer data from other major departments that see cancer patients. Using recent population estimates, we calculated crude cancer incidence rates of the ""minimally-reported cases"" for the Ashanti region. The most common cancers found in this study were breast (12.6 per 100,000), cervix (9.2 per 100,000), and prostate (8.8 per 100,000). These cancers occur at similar crude incidence rates in other West African countries. Females had overall higher incidence rates than males, which is consistent throughout the West African region. This study identified a number of methodological challenges facing cancer registries in Ghana that can be addressed to improve the quality of cancer registries in other resource-limited settings. Such registries should be tailored to the local health system context. A lack of coordination among the sources reporting cancer cases and a lack of understanding of local health-care systems and payment plans may interfere with the quality, completeness, and comparability of data from cancer registries in resource-limited settings.

In the last years, obesity has been studied as a potential risk factor for prostate disease and recently a link has been demonstrated between visceral adiposity with prostate volume. The aim of this study was to analyze the relationship between obesity and prostate volume and growth during testosterone therapy in KS subjects.  Design and methods:   We evaluated reproductive hormones, metabolic parameters, anthropometric measures, PSA, and prostate volume in 121 naïve non-mosaic KS patients and 60 age-matched healthy male controls. Fifty-six KS hypogonadic subjects were treated with testosterone-gel 2% and reevaluated after 18 months of treatment.  Results:   Prostate volume in KS was positively related to waist circumference (WC). The KS group with WC ≥94 cm had significantly higher prostate volume, BMI, insulin plasma levels, homeostasis model assessment index, total cholesterol, triglycerides, and glycemia with respect to the KS group with WC <94 cm. After testosterone replacement therapy, only hypogonadic KS men with WC ≥94 cm had a statistically significant increase in prostate volume. Furthermore, in untreated KS subjects, prostate volume showed a statistically significant increase after 18 months of follow-up only in subjects with WC ≥94 cm.  Conclusions:   This study showed that visceral obesity, insulin resistance, and lipid and glucose metabolism alterations are associated with prostate volume and growth during testosterone replacement therapy in KS, independently from androgen or estrogen levels.

We describe our extended lymphadenectomy (e-PLND) and the pathological outcome with a modified template as described by Briganti and compare it with L-PLND.  Material and methods:   This was a retrospective study of 44 patients who underwent e-PLND and 36 patients who underwent L-PLND. The lymph node dissection regions were divided into: I the external iliac field, II the obturator field and III the internal iliac field.  Results:   The mean age was 70.2 years for e-PLND and 68.9 years for L-PLND. There was no significant difference in preoperative prostate-specific antigen (PSA), Gleason score or clinical stage between the two cohorts of patients. The mean operative time was 95 min.

The present study demonstrates how mahanine, a plant-derived carbazole alkaloid, restores RASSF1A expression by down-regulating specific members of the DNMT family of proteins in prostate cancer cells.  Results:   Using methylation-specific PCR we establish that mahanine restores the expression of RASSF1A by inducing the demethylation of its promoter in prostate cancer cells. Furthermore, we show that mahanine treatment induces the degradation of DNMT1 and DNMT3B, but not DNMT3A, via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway; an effect which is rescued in the presence of a proteasome inhibitor, MG132. The inactivation of Akt by wortmannin, a PI3K inhibitor, results in a similar down-regulation in the levels DNMT1 and DNMT3B. Mahanine treatment results in a decline in phospho-Akt levels and a disruption in the interaction of Akt with DNMT1 and DNMT3B. Conversely, the exogenous expression of constitutively active Akt inhibits the ability of mahanine to down-regulate these DNMTs, suggesting that the degradation of DNMT1 and DNMT3B by mahanine occurs via Akt inactivation.  Conclusions:   Taken together, we show that mahanine treatment induces the proteasomal degradation of DNMT1 and DNMT3B via the inactivation of Akt, which facilitates the demethylation of the RASSF1A promoter and restores its expression in prostate cancer cells. Therefore, mahanine could be a potential therapeutic agent for advanced prostate cancer in men when RASSF1A expression is silenced.""","""['Soumik Agarwal', 'Karishma S Amin', 'Shankar Jagadeesh', 'Gokul Baishay', 'Paruchuri G Rao', 'Nabin C Barua', 'Samir Bhattacharya', 'Partha P Banerjee']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Mol Cancer""","""['Mahanine reverses an epigenetically silenced tumor suppressor gene RASSF1A in human prostate cancer cells.', 'Tumor suppressor gene inactivation during cadmium-induced malignant transformation of human prostate cells correlates with overexpression of de novo DNA methyltransferase.', 'Epigenetic reactivation of RASSF1A by phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC) and promotion of apoptosis in LNCaP cells.', 'DNA methyltransferases in hematological malignancies.', 'Gene methylation in gastric cancer.', 'E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF180 prevents excessive PCDH10 methylation to suppress the proliferation and metastasis of gastric cancer cells by promoting ubiquitination of DNMT1.', 'Novel Paired Normal Prostate and Prostate Cancer Model Cell Systems Derived from African American Patients.', 'Downregulation of CAMK2N1 due to DNA Hypermethylation Mediated by DNMT1 that Promotes the Progression of Prostate Cancer.', 'Natural Products as Anticancer Agents: Current Status and Future Perspectives.', 'Inhibition of colorectal cancer tumorigenesis by ursolic acid and doxorubicin is mediated by targeting the Akt signaling pathway and activating the Hippo signaling pathway.']"""

From 2005 to 2011 a total of 15 patients were treated with HIFU as primary radical treatment. Between July 2011 and February 2013, all 15 patients presented biochemical relapse after HIFU and 11C choline PET documenting intrapostatic-only failure. Salvage EBRT was performed with moderate hypofractionation schedule in 28 fractions with volumetric modulation arc therapy (VMAT). Genito-urinary (GU) and rectal and bowel toxicity were scored by common terminology criteria for adverse events version 4 (CTCAE V.4) scale. Biochemical response was assessed by ASTRO Phoenix criteria. Median age of patients was 67 years (range: 53-85). The median Gleason score was 7 (range: 6-9). The median prostate specific antigen (PSA) at the time of biochemical relapse after HIFU was 5.2 ng/mL (range: 2-64.2). Seven of the 15 patients received androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) started after HIFU failure, interrupted before 11C choline PET and radiotherapy. Median prescribed dose was 71.4 Gy (range: 71.4-74.2 Gy) in 28 fractions. No radiation related major upper gastrointestinal (GI), rectal and GU toxicity were experienced. GU, acute grade 1 and grade 2 toxicities were recorded in 7/15 and 4/15 respectively; bowel acute grade 1 and grade 2 toxicities in 4/15 and 1/15; rectal acute grade 1 and grade 2 toxicities in 3/15 and 2/15 respectively. No grade 3 or greater acute or late toxicities occurred. Biochemical control was assessed in 12/15 (80%) patients. With a median follow up of 12 months, three out of 15 patients, with biochemical relapse, showed lymph-nodal recurrence. Our early clinical results and biochemical data confirm the feasibility and show a good tolerance of the 11C choline PET guided salvage radiation therapy after HIFU failure.

Microbubbles stimulated by ultrasound have recently been demonstrated as a radiation enhancer when used with different cancer models including PC3. Here, photoacoustics imaging technique was used to assess this treatment's effects on haemoglobin levels and oxygen saturation. Correlations between this modality and power doppler assessments of blood flow, and histology measurements of vascular integrity and cell death were also investigated. Xenograft prostate tumours in SCID mice were treated with 0, 2, or 8 Gy radiation combined with microbubbles exposed to 500 kHz ultrasound at a peak negative pressure of 0, 570, and 750 kPa. Tumours were assessed and levels of total haemoglobin, oxygen saturation were measured using photoacoustics before and 24 hours after treatment along with power doppler measured blood flow. Mice were then sacrificed and tumours were assessed for cell death and vascular composition using immunohistochemistry. Treatments using 8 Gy and microbubbles resulted in oxygen saturation decreasing by 28 ± 10% at 570 kPa and 25 ± 29% at 750 kPa, which corresponded to 44 ± 9% and 40 ± 14% respective decreases in blood flow as measured with power doppler. Corresponding histology indicated 31 ± 5% at 570 kPa and 37 ± 5% at 750 kPa in terms of cell death. There were drops in intact vasculature of 15 ± 2% and 20 ± 2%, for treatments at 570 kPa and 750 kPa. In summary, photoacoustic measures of total haemoglobin and oxygen saturation paralleled changes in power doppler indicators of blood flow. Destruction of tumour microvasculature with microbubble-enhanced radiation also led to decreases in blood flow and was associated with increases in cell death and decreases in intact vasculature as detected with CD31 labeling.""","""['K Briggs', 'A Al Mahrouki', 'J Nofiele', 'A El-Falou', 'M Stanisz', 'H C Kim', 'M C Kolios', 'G J Czarnota']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Technol Cancer Res Treat""","""['Quantitative ultrasound characterization of tumor cell death: ultrasound-stimulated microbubbles for radiation enhancement.', 'Microbubble-based enhancement of radiation effect: Role of cell membrane ceramide metabolism.', 'Cellular characterization of ultrasound-stimulated microbubble radiation enhancement in a prostate cancer xenograft model.', 'Ultrasound-stimulated microbubble enhancement of radiation response.', 'Italian Society of Cardiovascular Echography (SIEC) Consensus Conference on the state of the art of contrast echocardiography.', 'Ultrasound-stimulated microbubbles enhancement of fractionated radiation for tumor treatment.', 'Focused Ultrasound Stimulation of Microbubbles in Combination With Radiotherapy for Acute Damage of Breast Cancer Xenograft Model.', 'Involvement of Ceramide Signalling in Radiation-Induced Tumour Vascular Effects and Vascular-Targeted Therapy.', 'Application of Ultrasound Combined with Microbubbles for Cancer Therapy.', 'Effect of Ultrasound-Stimulated Microbubbles and Hyperthermia on Tumor Vasculature of Breast Cancer Xenograft.']"""

Set-up corrections from 60 prostate cancer patients treated on helical tomotherapy (HT) were used to simulate four types of image-guidance protocols which were based on: (i) a limited number of imaging sessions (IG-1), (ii) reduced registration tasks during daily imaging (IG-2), or (iii) and (iv) mixed methods of imaging (IG-3, IG-4). Each protocol was evaluated for three referencing scenarios based on the first fraction, first three fractions and first five fractions. Residual set-up error, the difference between the average set-up correction and the actual correction required, was used to evaluate the accuracy of each protocol. The first five fractions referencing scenario provides the highest reduction of the margins for each image-guidance protocol evaluated in this study. The first type of protocol is the shortest way to the effective correction of the systematic component of set-up error. For the second type of the protocol, the control of the residual errors is better and, as a result, the reduction of the margins is more significant than that obtained for the first one. Moreover, the second type of the protocol provides the highest accuracy of delivered dose. The result obtained for the fourth type of protocol does not decrease the calculated margins or increase their accuracy in correspondence to the no image guidance scheme. The fourth type of the protocol is not recommended as a protocol to be used to increase the conformity of the dose. The choice of the rest protocols should be validated in the context of (i) institutional practice regarding patient set-up procedure and its time consumption, (ii) acceptable balance between the amount of the dose delivered to the organ at risk and the additional imaging dose and (iii) patient anatomical conditions.""","""['T Piotrowski', 'K Kaczmarek', 'T Bajon', 'A Ryczkowski', 'A Jodda', 'J Kaźmierska']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Technol Cancer Res Treat""","""['Evaluating the Need for Daily Image Guidance in Head and Neck Cancers Treated with Helical Tomotherapy: A Retrospective Analysis of a Large Number of Daily Imaging-based Corrections.', 'Evaluation of image-guidance strategies with helical tomotherapy for localised prostate cancer.', 'Image guidance in prostate cancer - can offline corrections be an effective substitute for daily online imaging?', 'Image-guided intensity-modulated radiotherapy of prostate cancer: Analysis of interfractional errors and acute toxicity.', 'Evaluation of multiple image-based modalities for image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT) of prostate carcinoma: a prospective study.', 'Treatment-integrated imaging, radiomics, and personalised radiotherapy: the future is at hand.', 'Forecasting of the composite dose for organs at risk and solid targets with random movements during different image-guided scenarios of the photon radiation therapy.

SOX7 is a transcription factor important to development, and its down-regulation has been reported in tumor tissues and cell lines of prostate, colon, and lung cancers. However, the regulation of SOX7 expression and its functional role in breast cancer have not been reported. The current study demonstrates that SOX7 mRNA and protein expression are down-regulated in breast cancer tissues and cell lines compared with adjacent normal tissues and nontumorigenic cells, respectively. The SOX7 promoter is hypermethylated in breast cancer cell lines compared with nontumorigenic cells, and the inhibition of DNA methylation increases SOX7 mRNA levels. With shRNA-mediated SOX7 silencing, nontumorigenic immortal breast cells display increased proliferation, migration, and invasion and form structures that resemble that of breast cancer cells in a three-dimensional culture system. Conversely, ectopic SOX7 expression inhibits proliferation, migration, and invasion of breast cancer cells in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. Importantly, we discovered that SOX7 transcript levels positively correlated with clinical outcome of 674 breast cancer patients.

Materials and methods:   We identified 342 men on active surveillance whose first biopsy occurred between 2000 and 2009. We investigated erectile function using patient reported outcomes, namely the 6 erectile function questions from the IIEF-6 (International Index of Erectile Function). We estimated the change in erectile function with time using locally weighted scatterplot smoothing.  Results:   The median (IQR) patient age in this cohort was 64 years (58-68). Median followup on active surveillance was 3.5 years (2.3-5.0) and the median number of biopsies was 5 (3-6). During the first 4 years on active surveillance erectile function decreased 1.0 point per year (95% CI 0.2, 1.7) on the IIEF-6 (scale 1 to 30). When stratified by comorbidities or number of biopsies we see an almost identical decrease in erectile function with time.

These phenomena are also closely associated with terminal phases of megakaryocyte maturation.  Materials and methods:   In Dami cells, MTT and trypan blue assays were used to investigate cell viability and proliferation effects of hNUDC, and flow cytometry was used to analyse cell cycle and DNA content. Real-time RT-PCR was employed to detect mRNA expression. Activations of caspase-3, ERK, Akt and Stat-5 were determined by immunoblotting. May-Grünwald-Giemsa staining was performed to reveal cell morphology.  Results and conclusion:   Functional studies using adenovirus-mediated hNUDC overexpression led to inhibition of megakaryocyte proliferation via cell cycle arrest in G2/M transition phase. This process could have been be mediated by upregulation of p21 and downregulation of its downstream targets, including cyclin B1, cyclin B2 and c-myc. Enhanced apoptosis in turn ensued, characterized by increased caspase-3 activation, upregulation of pro-apoptotic Bax and downregulation of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2. Furthermore, hNUDC overexpression elevated the level of megakaryocyte maturation, associated with increased polyploidy, cell morphological changes and increased expression of cell surface differentiation markers, including CD10, CD44, CD41 and CD61. Our results further suggest that the ERK signalling pathway was involved in hNUDC overexpression-induced apoptosis. Taken together, this study provides experimental evidence for overexpression of hNUDC in Dami cells and suggests that activation of apoptotic machinery may be involved in megakaryocytic differentiation.""","""['Y Xiao', 'Y Zheng', 'P Tan', 'P Xu', 'Q Zhang']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Cell Prolif""","""['Interference RNA (RNAi)-based silencing of endogenous thrombopoietin receptor (Mpl) in Dami cells resulted in decreased hNUDC-mediated megakaryocyte proliferation and differentiation.', 'hNUDC promotes the cell proliferation and differentiation in a leukemic cell line via activation of the thrombopoietin receptor (Mpl).', 'Semi-purified extracts of Commelina benghalensis (Commelinaceae) induce apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in Jurkat-T cells.', 'Regulation of cell differentiation by hNUDC via a Mpl-dependent mechanism in NIH 3T3 cells.', 'Gadd45 in the response of hematopoietic cells to genotoxic stress.', 'Epigenetic regulation of miR-129-2 and its effects on the proliferation and invasion in lung cancer cells.']"""

For diagnosis, predicting the outcome of the disease, and for assessing potential new biomarkers, pathologists and researchers routinely analyze histological samples. Morphological and molecular information may be integrated by aligning microscopic histological images in a multiplex fashion. This process is usually time-consuming and results in intra- and inter-user variability. The aim of this study is to investigate the feasibility of using modern image analysis methods for automated alignment of microscopic images from differently stained adjacent paraffin sections from prostatic tissue specimens.  Methods:   Tissue samples, obtained from biopsy or radical prostatectomy, were sectioned and stained with either hematoxylin & eosin (H&E), immunohistochemistry for p63 and AMACR or Time Resolved Fluorescence (TRF) for androgen receptor (AR). Image pairs were aligned allowing for translation, rotation and scaling. The registration was performed automatically by first detecting landmarks in both images, using the scale invariant image transform (SIFT), followed by the well-known RANSAC protocol for finding point correspondences and finally aligned by Procrustes fit. The Registration results were evaluated using both visual and quantitative criteria as defined in the text.  Results:   Three experiments were carried out. First, images of consecutive tissue sections stained with H&E and p63/AMACR were successfully aligned in 85 of 88 cases (96.6%). The failures occurred in 3 out of 13 cores with highly aggressive cancer (Gleason score ≥ 8). Second, TRF and H&E image pairs were aligned correctly in 103 out of 106 cases (97%).The third experiment considered the alignment of image pairs with the same staining (H&E) coming from a stack of 4 sections. The success rate for alignment dropped from 93.8% in adjacent sections to 22% for sections furthest away.  Conclusions:   The proposed method is both reliable and fast and therefore well suited for automatic segmentation and analysis of specific areas of interest, combining morphological information with protein expression data from three consecutive tissue sections. Finally, the performance of the algorithm seems to be largely unaffected by the Gleason grade of the prostate tissue samples examined, at least up to Gleason score 7.""","""['Giuseppe Lippolis', 'Anders Edsjö', 'Leszek Helczynski', 'Anders Bjartell', 'Niels Chr Overgaard']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['An artificial intelligence algorithm for prostate cancer diagnosis in whole slide images of core needle biopsies: a blinded clinical validation and deployment study.', 'Immunohistochemical biomarker validation in highly selective needle biopsy microarrays derived from mpMRI-characterized prostates.', 'A systems-based modelling approach using transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) specimens yielded incremental prognostic significance to Gleason when predicting long-term outcome in men with localized prostate cancer.', 'The 2014 International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) Consensus Conference on Gleason Grading of Prostatic Carcinoma: Definition of Grading Patterns and Proposal for a New Grading System.', 'Computer-Aided Prostate Cancer Diagnosis From Digitized Histopathology: A Review on Texture-Based Systems.', 'Statistical Considerations and Tools to Improve Histopathologic Protocols with Spectroscopic Imaging.', 'Image fusion of IR and optical microscopy for mapping of biomolecules in tissue.', 'AI applications in renal pathology.', 'HISTOBREAST, a collection of brightfield microscopy images of Haematoxylin and Eosin stained breast tissue.', 'Digital staining through the application of deep neural networks to multi-modal multi-photon microscopy.']"""

It was mainly motivated by the fact that pathological tissue presents an increased stiffness when compared to surrounding normal tissue. In the last two decades, research on elasticity imaging has been an international and interdisciplinary pursuit aiming to map the viscoelastic properties of tissue in order to provide clinically useful information. As a result, several modalities of elasticity imaging, mostly based on ultrasound but also on magnetic resonance imaging and optical coherence tomography, have been proposed and applied to a number of clinical applications: cancer diagnosis (prostate, breast, liver), hepatic cirrhosis, renal disease, thyroiditis, arterial plaque evaluation, wall stiffness in arteries, evaluation of thrombosis in veins, and many others. In this context, numerical methods are applied to solve forward and inverse problems implicit in the algorithms in order to estimate viscoelastic linear and nonlinear parameters, especially for quantitative elasticity imaging modalities. In this work, an introduction to elasticity imaging modalities is presented. The working principle of qualitative modalities (sonoelasticity, strain elastography, acoustic radiation force impulse) and quantitative modalities (Crawling Waves Sonoelastography, Spatially Modulated Ultrasound Radiation Force (SMURF), Supersonic Imaging) will be explained. Subsequently, the areas in which numerical methods can be applied to elasticity imaging are highlighted and discussed.

Little is known, however, as to how the HSC niche may regulate dormancy in cancer cells. In this study, we investigated the effects of TANK binding kinase 1 (TBK1) on PCa dormancy in the BM niche. We found that binding with niche osteoblasts induces the expression of TBK1 in PCa cells PC3 and C4-2B. Interestingly, TBK1 interacts with mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and inhibits its function. Rapamycin, an mTOR inhibitor, induces cell cycle arrest of PCa cells and enhances chemotherapeutic resistance of PCa cells.

Continued activation of androgen receptor (AR) signaling is attributed as one of the most important mechanisms underlying failure of therapy. Recently, the discovery of constitutively active AR splice variants (AR-Vs) adds more credence to this idea. Expression of AR-Vs in metastases portends a rapid progression of the tumor. However, the precise role of the AR-Vs in CRPC still remains unknown. ARv567es is one of the two AR variants frequently found in human CRPC xenografts and metastases. Herein, we developed a probasin (Pb) promoter-driven ARv567es transgenic mouse, Pb-ARv567es, to evaluate the role of ARv567es in both autonomous prostate growth and progression to CRPC. We found that expression of ARv567es in the prostate results in epithelial hyperplasia by 16 weeks and invasive adenocarcinoma is evident by 1 year of age. The underlying genetic cellular events involved a cell cycle-related transcriptome and differential expression of a spectrum of genes that are critical for tumor initiation and progression. These findings indicate that ARv567es could induce tumorigenesis de novo and signifies the critical role of AR-Vs in CRPC.

Here, discovery of a biochemical circuit linking hormone signaling to DNA repair and therapeutic resistance is reported. Findings show that androgen receptor (AR) activity is induced by DNA damage and promotes expression and activation of a gene expression program governing DNA repair. Subsequent investigation revealed that activated AR promotes resolution of double-strand breaks and resistance to DNA damage both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNAPKcs) was identified as a key target of AR after damage, controlling AR-mediated DNA repair and cell survival after genotoxic insult. Finally, DNAPKcs was shown to potentiate AR function, consistent with a dual role in both DNA repair and transcriptional regulation.

However, the validity of the DT in men with prostate cancer and over differing time points from diagnosis has not been well examined.  Method:   Receiver operating characteristics analyses were used to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the DT compared with three commonly used standardised scales in two prospective and one cross-sectional survey of men with prostate cancer (n = 740, 189 and 463, respectively). Comparison scales included the Impact of Event Scale - Revised (IES-R, Study 1), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS, Study 2) and the Brief Symptom Inventory-18 (BSI-18, Study 3).  Results:   Study 1: the DT showed good accuracy against the IES-R at all time points (area under curves (AUCs) ranging from 0.84 to 0.88) and sensitivity was high (>85%). Study 2: the DT performed well against both the anxiety and depression subscales for HADS at baseline (AUC = 0.84 and 0.82, respectively), but sensitivity decreased substantially after 12 months. Study 3: validity was high for the anxiety (AUC = 0.90, sensitivity = 90%) and depression (AUC = 0.85, sensitivity = 74%) subscales of the BSI-18 but was poorer for somatization (AUC = 0.67, sensitivity = 52%). A DT cut-off between ≥3 and ≥6 maximised sensitivity and specificity across analyses.  Conclusions:   The DT is a valid tool to detect cancer-specific distress, anxiety and depression among prostate cancer patients, particularly close to diagnosis. A cut-off of ≥4 may be optimal soon after diagnosis, and for longer-term assessments, ≥3 was supported. © 2013 The Authors.

Using gene set enrichment analysis, we identified a 19-gene signature enriched in indolent prostate tumors. We then further classified this signature with a decision tree learning model to identify three genes--FGFR1, PMP22, and CDKN1A--that together accurately predicted outcome of low Gleason score tumors. Validation of this three-gene panel on independent cohorts confirmed its independent prognostic value as well as its ability to improve prognosis with currently used clinical nomograms.

However, epidemiologic findings have been inconsistent. In an attempt to confirm and expand the findings that the PCa risk increased in men carrying G84E, we therefore performed a meta-analysis to clarify the association between the germline G84E mutation and PCa risk. We also aim to verify the increased PCa risk with respect to diagnostic age, family history, and disease aggressiveness. Comprehensive search of databases was carried out, and other relevant articles were also identified. Then, the meta-analyses were conducted according to the standard guidelines. A total of 11 studies with 120,167 participants were included on the basis of inclusion criteria. The G84E allele carrier frequencies ranged from 0.1 to 4.9 % in the patients with PCa, as compared with 0 to 1.4 % in control subjects. Men with the HOXB13 G84E variant had a 4.51-fold higher relative risk of PCa compared with non-carriers (95 % CI 3.28-6.20). The much higher risks were observed in individuals with early onset (odds ratio (OR) = 9.73, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 6.57-14.39), more than two affected relatives (OR = 7.27, 95 % CI 4.02-13.15), and highly aggressive disease (OR = 5.81, 95 % CI 3.72-9.08). Our findings provide further evidences that the rare mutation in HOXB13 contributes to both hereditary and sporadic PCa risk.

However, most studies did not control adequately for confounders and included cardiac patients. Furthermore, the validity of this prognostic role needs to be tested in different types of cancer. The present study tested the prognostic role of HRV in prostate cancer (PC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, using a historical prospective design. HRV was derived from brief 10 sec ECGs obtained at approximately the time of diagnosis in 113 PC patients and 133 NSCLC patients. Outcomes included prostate-specific antigen (PSA) at 6 and 24 months in PC, and overall survival (OS) (for the full sample) and survival time (for the deceased patients) in NSCLC. Furthermore, the possible mediating role of C-reactive protein (CRP) was tested (in NSCLC), as well as whether age and stage moderated the relationship between HRV and prognosis in both types of cancer. In the PC patients, HRV significantly inversely predicted PSA levels at 6 and 24 months, independent of confounders. Furthermore, this was particularly significant in metastatic PC patients, indicating moderation by stage. In NSCLC patients, HRV did not predict OS and survival time, but it did positively predict survival time in patients under the age of 65, independent of confounders. Additionally, CRP was not found to mediate the relationship between HRV and OS or survival time in NSCLC. The present results partly support previous studies and extend them to two additional common types of cancer, using a more rigorous control over confounders. Together with recent experimental findings, these results propose a modulatory role of vagal nerve activity in cancer.

The relationship between time to PSA nadir (TTN) and PSA halving time with time to PSA progression and overall chemotherapy response duration was analysed. TTN was a strong predictor of the duration of chemotherapy response and time to PSA progression.

Nanoparticulate paclitaxel (Crititax®, CTI52010) is paclitaxel that consists only of nanoparticulate drug in saline. Our objective was to examine the effect of nanoparticulate paclitaxel on prostate cancer cells derived from castration-resistant prostate cancer in men and dogs, as companion dogs represent a unique naturally occurring model of castration-resistant prostate cancer. We hypothesized that nanoparticulate paclitaxel would be effective in affecting cell viability, colony forming ability, apoptosis, and induction of structural changes to the microtubules of prostate cancer cells.  Methods:   Human PC3 and canine Ace-1 cells were treated with 0.001-1.0 μm concentrations of paclitaxel and nanoparticulate paclitaxel. Cell viability, apoptosis, and colony forming assays were analyzed and compared in the presence of both drugs. Microtubule structure was examined by fluorescence microscopy following incubation with drug.  Results:   Nanoparticulate paclitaxel was as effective as standard paclitaxel in decreasing cell viability, decreasing colony forming ability, and inducing apoptosis in human and canine prostate cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner. Fluorescence microscopy confirmed the microtubule target of nanoparticulate paclitaxel.  Conclusions:   Nanoparticulate paclitaxel is as effective as paclitaxel in decreasing cell viability, initiating apoptosis, decreasing cell survival, and causing rigidity of microtubules in both human and canine castration-resistant prostate cancer.

After preliminary evaluation of the sensitivity and spatial resolution using a Derenzo phantom, a real small-field head and neck treatment plan was simulated, with and without introducing patient displacements. No wash-out was taken into account. 3D maps of the annihilation photon locations were deduced from the PET data acquired right after the treatment session (5 min acquisition) using a dedicated OS-EM reconstruction algorithm. Detection sensitivity at the center of the field-of-view (FOV) varied from 5.2% (45° dual-head system) to 7.0% (full-ring PET).

Inhibition of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and disruption of the adrenergic receptors, specifically Ardβ 2, resulted in the prevention of primary PCa tumor development in mice. The authors found that inhibition of the SNS is only successful in preventing murine tumor development if completed early enough, and the parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) predominates in later stages of PCa.

That paradigm subsequently changed, and several PP2A protein inhibitors have been discovered. (2) The protein I2PP2A (SET) is considered to be oncogenic, i.e., PP2A is a tumor suppressor, and is overexpressed in many tumor cell types (ref. 3, and refs. therein). I2PP2A also has other targets besides PP2A, e.g., DNA exonucleases and modification of histone acetylation.

We aimed to study the prevalence of intrusive thoughts about prostate cancer and their association with quality-of-life outcomes before and after radical prostatectomy.  Methods:   During the first year of the LAPPRO-trial, 971 men scheduled for radical prostatectomy were prospectively included from 14 urological centers in Sweden. Of those, 833 men responded to two consecutive study-specific questionnaires before and three months after surgery (participation rate 86%). The association of intrusive thoughts with three quality-of-life outcomes, i.e. self-assessed quality of life, depressive mood and waking up with anxiety was estimated by prevalence ratios that were calculated, together with a 95% confidence interval, at the same time-point as well as over time. Fisher's exact-test was used to analyze differences between respondents and non-respondents. Wilcoxon signed-ranks and Cochran-Armitage trend tests were used for analysis of change over time. To validate new questions on intrusive thoughts, written answers to open-ended questions were read and analyzed by qualitative content analysis.  Results:   Before surgery, 603 men (73%) reported negative intrusive thoughts about their cancer at some time in the past month and 593 men (59%) reported such thoughts three months after surgery. Comparing those reporting intrusive thoughts at least weekly or once a week before surgery with those who did not, the prevalence ratio (95% confidence interval), three months after surgery, for waking up in the middle of the night with anxiety was 3.9 (2.7 to 5.5), for depressed mood 1.8 (1.6 to 2.1) and for impaired self-assessed quality of life 1.3 (1.2 to 1.5).

Understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in the therapeutic responsiveness of HDACI is needed before its clinical application. This study aimed to determine if a potent HDACI, LBH589 (Panobinostat), had differential therapeutic responsiveness towards LNCaP and PC-3 prostate cancer (PCa) cells. The former showed prometaphase arrest with subsequent apoptosis upon LBH589 treatment, while the latter was less sensitive and had late G2 arrest. The LBH589 treatment down-regulated HDAC6 and sustained ERK activation, and contributed to prometaphase arrest. Mechanistically, LBH589 inhibited HDAC6 activity, caused its dissociation from protein phosphatase PP1α, and increased 14-3-3ζ acetylation. Acetylated 14-3-3ζ released its mask effect on serine 259 of c-Raf and serine 216 of Cdc25C subsequent to de-phosphorylation by PP1α, which contributed to ERK activation. Enhanced ERK activity by LBH589 further down-regulated HDAC6 protein levels and sustained ERK activation by free-forward regulation. The sustained Cdc25C and ERK activation resulted in early M-phase (prometaphase) arrest and subsequent apoptosis in the most sensitive LNCaP cells but not in PC-3 cells. This study provides pre-clinical evidence that HDAC6 may serve as a sensitive therapeutic target in the treatment of prostate cancer with HDACI LBH589 for clinical translation.

Patients and methods:   In intensity-modulated radiotherapy of prostate cancer patients were positioned according to internal fiducials in six dimensions by the use of ExacTrac/Novalis Body™ (ET/NB) System and a robotic couch. Intrafractional displacement of both, prostate and patient were analyzed in 427 treatment fractions of 13 patients. Systematic and random components were specified and used for intra-treatment margin calculation. The potential reduction of treatment margins, and intrafractional repositioning by use of the ET Snap Verification presumed, was simulated.  Results:   The mean treatment duration was 14.2±2.6 min. Standard deviations (SDs) of the effective intrafractional target displacement in superior-inferior (SI) and anterior-posterior (AP) axes were 2.4 mm and 2.1 mm, respectively. Systematic errors for patient were 1.8 and 1.7 mm, and for prostate movement were 2.1 and 2.0 mm in SI and AP, respectively.

Many retrospective studies on its etiology and pathogenesis have been carried out to explain pathological mechanisms; most of them just take a close look at the issue of dosage and application. Recently, attempts have been made, to identify co-factors which might promote the development of BRONJ.  Patients and methods:   The present study is based on data of 169 patients with osseous metastatic malignancies. All patients received intravenous bisphosphonate therapy. On the basis of medical history, malignancy, and primary treatment, the modality of bisphosphonate therapy, and existing comorbidities and medication were analyzed. The role of immunosuppressive drugs, influence of underlying diseases, and general factors such as age and gender were examined. The predictability of necrotic involvement, influenced by the underlying malignancy and its specific therapy, e.g. radiation and cytostatic therapy were analyzed and statistically evaluated.  Results:   A total of 8.9% (n=15) of patients developed BRONJ. The average time between diagnosis of malignancy and BRONJ was 80 months. Nine patients suffered from breast cancer, five had prostate cancer and one renal cancer. Separation into stage and histological subtype did not show any significant correlation, nor did age or gender, to the occurrence of BRONJ. However statistical analysis did show a significant correlation concerning monocytostatic (p=0.0215) and triple-cytostatic therapy (p=0.0137). The majority of patients with BRONJ (60%) received a bisphosphonate therapy including zoledronate. Single application with one bisphosphonate was administered in 28 cases; 44 patients had a medical history of different use of bisphosphonate. Concomitant medication did not suggest possible correlation, nor did accompanying diseases, arterial hypertension (33.33%) or arterial microcirculatory disturbances (20%).  Conclusion:   The evaluation of our results is pioneering. The influence of cytostatics and combined therapy of cytotoxic drugs on the pathogenesis of BRONJ is demonstrated here statistically. We confirmed a drug- and dose-dependent occurrence of BRONJ.

We have hypothesized that degeneration and/or apoptosis of metastatic PCa cells in pelvic lymph nodes can distinguish between aggressive and non-aggressive metastatic disease in patients. Our objective was to define the relationship between metastatic cell lysis and the presence of immune cells.  Materials and methods:   We studied archival primary PCa (n=38) and cancer-positive regional pelvic nodes (n=32) from the same patients undergoing radical retropubic prostatectomy at the Minneapolis Veterans Affairs Medical Center.  Results:   Using morphological and immunohistochemical features of immune and metastatic cancer cells, we have identified progression of metastasis in the nodal compartments. Nodal parenchyma contained small, intermediate and large metastatic nodules/tumors. Immune surveillance occurred primarily in small tumors and surveillance was either absent or greatly reduced in intermediate and large tumors in nodes. Metastatic nodules/cells were lysed or became apoptotic when under immune-surveillance, as indicated by pyknotic nuclei and cytoplasm, the latter still had remnants of prostate specific antigen (PSA) staining. Metastatic cells without surveillance did not exhibit morphological features of cell degeneration (lysis) or apoptosis. Metastatic cells under immune-surveillance had an inverse relationship with those without immune-surveillance. This relationship differed from node to node and patient to patient.  Conclusion:   We have shown that at least two populations of metastatic cells were present in the nodes; the first group of cells was under immune surveillance, as indicated by limited to wide-spread cell lysis/apoptosis, and the second group did not exhibit morphological evidence of cell lysis indicating emergence of surveillance-unresponsive (resistant) metastatic cells. These criteria can be used to distinguish metastatic cancer that is expected to be responsive to immunotherapy from that which would show little or no benefit from such treatment. Enhancement of immune surveillance and other treatments can be used to treat surveillance-unresponsive (resistant) disease to improve survival of patients.""","""['Akhouri A Sinha', 'Eduardo T Fernandes', 'Stephen L Ewing', 'Michael J Wilson']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Anticancer Res""","""['Prediction of pelvic lymph node metastasis by the ratio of cathepsin B to stefin A in patients with prostate carcinoma.', 'Robotic extended pelvic lymphadenectomy for intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer.', 'Extended pelvic lymphadenectomy in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy: high incidence of lymph node metastasis.', 'Anatomical extent of pelvic lymphadenectomy in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy.', 'Immune reaction by cytoreductive prostatectomy.']"""

In 42 tumor foci, the associations of the ADC values with the clinicopathological characteristics and Ki-67 labeling index (LI) were analyzed.  Results:   High-grade cancers (Gleason score [GS] ≥ 4 + 3), larger cancers (maximum diameter (MD) ≥ 16 mm), and highly proliferating cancers (Ki-67 LI ≥ 4.43 %) had significantly lower ADC values, respectively (P < .001, P = .008, and P = .044, respectively). There was no significant difference in ADC value according to age, prostate-specific antigen, presence of extra-prostatic extension, and intra-tumoral stroma proportion. Multivariate analysis showed that GS, Ki-67 LI, and MD had independent and significant correlations with ADC value (P < .001, P = .006, and P = .002, respectively). Low ADC tumors (<0.52 × 10(-3) mm(2)/s) are likely to be high-grade cancer foci compared with high ADC tumors (relative risk: 65.2). The sensitivity and specificity of the ADC value to predict high-grade cancer foci are 81.8 and 93.5 %, respectively.

As cis-eQTLs are highly tissue-specific, we asked if GWAS-identified prostate cancer risk loci are cis-eQTLs in human prostate tumor tissues. We investigated 50 prostate cancer samples for their genotype at 59 prostate cancer risk-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and performed cis-eQTL analysis of transcripts from paired primary tumors within two megabase windows. We tested 586 transcript-genotype associations, of which 27 were significant (false discovery rate ≤10%). An equivalent eQTL analysis of the same prostate cancer risk loci in lymphoblastoid cell lines did not result in any significant associations. The top-ranked cis-eQTL involved the IRX4 (Iroquois homeobox protein 4) transcript and rs12653946, tagged by rs10866528 in our study (P=4.91 × 10(-5)). Replication studies, linkage disequilibrium, and imputation analyses highlight population specificity at this locus.

However, data on CAR expression in cancer types are conflicting and several entities have not been analysed to date.  Methods:   The expression of CAR was assessed by immunohistochemical staining of tissue microarrays (TMA) containing 3714 specimens derived from 100 malignancies and from 273 normal control tissues.  Results:   The expression of CAR was detected in all normal organs, except in the brain. Expression levels, however, displayed a broad range from being barely detectable (for example, in the thymus) to high abundance expression (for example, in the liver and gastric mucosa). In malignancies, a high degree of variability was notable also, ranging from significantly elevated CAR expression (for example, in early stages of malignant transformation and several tumours of the female reproductive system) to decreased CAR expression (for example, in colon and prostate cancer types).  Conclusion:   Our results provide a comprehensive insight into CAR expression in neoplasms and indicate that CAR may offer a valuable target for adenovirus-based therapy in a subset of carcinomas.

For evaluation purposes, predictions were also performed using the patients' planning CTs (pCT).  Methods:   To get reliable CBCT electron densities for PDI predictions, Hounsfield units from the pCT were mapped onto the CBCT, while accounting for non-rigidity in patient anatomy in an approximate way. PDI prediction accuracy was first validated for an anatomical phantom, using IMRT treatment plans of ten prostate cancer patients. Clinical performance was studied using data acquired for 50 prostate cancer patients. For each patient, 4-5 CBCTs were available, resulting in a total of 1413 evaluated images. Measured and predicted PDIs were compared using γ-analyses with 3% global dose difference and 3 mm distance to agreement as reference criteria. Moreover, the pass rate for automated PDI comparison was assessed. To quantify improvements in IMRT fluence verification accuracy results from multiple fractions were combined by generating a γ-image with values halfway the minimum and median γ values, pixel by pixel.  Results:   For patients, CBCT-based PDI predictions showed a high agreement with measurements, with an average percentage of rejected pixels of 1.41% only. In spite of possible intra-fraction motion and anatomy changes, this was only slightly larger than for phantom measurements (0.86%). For pCT-based predictions, the agreement deteriorated (average percentage of rejected pixels 2.98%), due to an enhanced impact of anatomy variations. For predictions based on CBCT, combination of the first 2 fractions yielded gamma results in close agreement with pre-treatment analyses (average percentage of rejected pixels 0.63% versus 0.35%, percentage of rejected beams 0.6% versus 0%). For the pCT-based approach, only combination of the first 5 fractions resulted in acceptable agreement with pre-treatment results.  Conclusion:   In-room acquired CBCT scans can be used for high accuracy IMRT fluence verification based on in-vivo measured EPID images. Combination of γ results for the first 2 fractions can largely compensate for small accuracy reductions, with respect to pre-treatment verification, related to intra-fraction motion and anatomy changes.""","""['Ali Sam Ali', 'Maarten L P Dirkx', 'Ruud M Cools', 'Ben J M Heijmen']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Radiat Oncol""","""['Clinical experience with EPID dosimetry for prostate IMRT pre-treatment dose verification.', ""Evaluation of the 'dose of the day' for IMRT prostate cancer patients derived from portal dose measurements and cone-beam CT."", 'Replacing pretreatment verification with in vivo EPID dosimetry for prostate IMRT.', 'Quantitative cone-beam CT imaging in radiation therapy using planning CT as a prior: first patient studies.', 'Dosimetric verification of IMRT and 3D conformal treatment delivery using EPID.', 'Investigating the effectiveness of monitoring relevant variations during IMRT and VMAT treatments by EPID-based 3D in vivo verification performed using planning CTs.', 'Surface refraction of sound waves affects calibration of three-dimensional ultrasound.', 'A comparative assessment of prostate positioning guided by three-dimensional ultrasound and cone beam CT.']"""

In contrast to the FDA-approved CellSearch system, VACV detects circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in a cancer biomarker-independent manner, thus, free of any bias related to the use of antibodies, and can be potentially a universal system for detection of live CTCs of any tumor type, not limited to CTCs of epithelial origin. Furthermore, we demonstrate for the first time that VACV was effective in preventing and reducing circulating tumor cells in mice bearing human tumor xenografts. Importantly, a single intra-peritoneal delivery of VACV resulted in a dramatic decline in the number of tumor cells in the ascitic fluid from a patient with gastric cancer.

However, targeting AR alone can result in drug resistance and disease recurrence. Therefore, simultaneous targeting of multiple pathways could in principle be an effective approach to treating prostate cancer. Here we provide proof-of-concept that a small-molecule inhibitor of nuclear β-catenin activity (called C3) can inhibit both the AR and β-catenin-signaling pathways that are often misregulated in prostate cancer. Treatment with C3 ablated prostate cancer cell growth by disruption of both β-catenin/T-cell factor and β-catenin/AR protein interaction, reflecting the fact that T-cell factor and AR have overlapping binding sites on β-catenin. Given that AR interacts with, and is transcriptionally regulated by β-catenin, C3 treatment also resulted in decreased occupancy of β-catenin on the AR promoter and diminished AR and AR/β-catenin target gene expression. Interestingly, C3 treatment resulted in decreased AR binding to target genes accompanied by decreased recruitment of an AR and β-catenin cofactor, coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1 (CARM1), providing insight into the unrecognized function of β-catenin in prostate cancer. Importantly, C3 inhibited tumor growth in an in vivo xenograft model and blocked renewal of bicalutamide-resistant sphere-forming cells, indicating the therapeutic potential of this approach.""","""['Eugine Lee', 'Aviv Madar', 'Gregory David', 'Michael J Garabedian', 'Ramanuj Dasgupta', 'Susan K Logan']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A""","""['Activation of β-Catenin Cooperates with Loss of Pten to Drive AR-Independent Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Inhibition of the Wnt/β-Catenin Pathway Overcomes Resistance to Enzalutamide in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'p68/DdX5 supports β-catenin & RNAP II during androgen receptor mediated transcription in prostate cancer.', 'Revisiting the role of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in prostate cancer.', 'Multifaceted interaction between the androgen and Wnt signaling pathways and the implication for prostate cancer.', 'Bipolar Androgen Therapy: When Excess Fuel Extinguishes the Fire.', 'Glucocorticoid Receptor and β-Catenin Interact in Prostate Cancer Cells and Their Co-Inhibition Attenuates Tumorsphere Formation, Stemness, and Docetaxel Resistance.', 'Stromal androgen signaling acts as tumor niches to drive prostatic basal epithelial progenitor-initiated oncogenesis.', 'CARM1-mediated methylation of ASXL2 impairs tumor-suppressive function of MLL3/COMPASS.', 'Aberrant androgen action in prostatic progenitor cells induces oncogenesis and tumor development through IGF1 and Wnt axes.']"""

To investigate whether famotidine can reduce hematologic toxicity in patients treated with radiotherapy for prostate cancer.  Methods:   A total of 36 patients undergoing radiotherapy for prostate cancer were randomized to receive either placebo or famotidine tablets. Participants were pretreated with 40 mg of oral famotidine or placebo tablets twice daily, 4 and 3 hr before each radiotherapy fraction. The patients received external-beam radiotherapy up to 70 Gy. Complete blood counts with differential, platelet counts, and hemoglobin levels were obtained at baseline, biweekly during the treatment and once 4 weeks after the end of radiotherapy course. Magnitude of changes from baseline in the hematological parameters was determined and compared using Repeated Measures ANOVA.  Results:   Famotidine was well tolerated. A total of 112 blood samples were evaluated. A significant reduction in radiation-induced lymphocytopenia was noted in patients receiving famotidine than in patients receiving placebo (P = 0.006). No significant difference was observed between two groups for the decline in platelets, erythrocytes and leucocytes. For both groups, neutrophil, monocyte, eosinophil, and hemoglobin levels did not change significantly during the treatment.  Conclusions:   Our results indicate that famotidine could result in a significant reduction in radiation-induced lymphocytopenia and may consequently increase radiotherapy efficacy as well as survival times.

Of 135 patients with a unilateral tumor, 80 (59.3%), 28 (20.7%), and 15 (11.1%) had ipsilateral, contralateral, and bilateral positive LN. 15-year biochemical-recurrence free, metastases-free and cancer-specific survival was 7.1%, 41.5%, and 57.5%, respectively. Predictors of biochemical-recurrence, metastases and death from PC in multivariate analysis included Gleason sum at RP, the number and percent of positive LN; notably total number of LN dissected did not predict outcome.  Conclusions:   In this highly-selected RP cohort, men found to have N1PC disease at RP can experience a durable long-term metastases-free and cancer-specific survival. Predictors of survival include Gleason sum, number, and percentage of positive LN. While total number of LN dissected was not predictive, approximately 30% of men with N1PC will have positive LN contralateral to the primary prostatic lesion highlighting the importance of a thorough, bilateral pelvic LN dissection.""","""['Phillip M Pierorazio', 'Michael A Gorin', 'Ashley E Ross', 'Zhaoyong Feng', 'Bruce J Trock', 'Edward M Schaeffer', 'Misop Han', 'Jonathan I Epstein', 'Alan W Partin', 'Patrick C Walsh', 'Trinity J Bivalacqua']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Re: pathological and oncologic outcomes for men with positive lymph nodes at radical prostatectomy: the Johns Hopkins Hospital 30-year experience.', 'Radical prostatectomy improves progression-free and cancer-specific survival in men with lymph node positive prostate cancer in the prostate-specific antigen era: a confirmatory study.', 'Radical prostatectomy represents an effective treatment in patients with specimen-confined high pathological Gleason score prostate cancer.', 'Long-term outcome after radical prostatectomy for patients with lymph node positive prostate cancer in the prostate specific antigen era.', 'Long-term oncological outcomes after laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.', 'Contemporary role of salvage lymphadenectomy in patients with recurrence following radical prostatectomy.', 'Prediction of pelvic lymph node metastases and PSMA PET positive pelvic lymph nodes with multiparametric MRI and clinical information in primary staging of prostate cancer.', 'Utility of diffusion weighted imaging-based radiomics nomogram to predict pelvic lymph nodes metastasis in prostate cancer.', 'Adjuvant Treatment Approaches after Radical Prostatectomy with Lymph Node Involvement.', 'Applied anatomy of pelvic lymph nodes and its clinical significance for prostate cancer:a single-center cadaveric study.', 'Considering the role of radical prostatectomy in 21st century prostate cancer care.']"""

FEOJ suppressed cancer cell motility and invasiveness at the concentrations where FEOJ did not show anti-proliferative activity. FEOJ increased transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) associated with tightening TJs, and suppressed expression of claudin proteins. Furthermore, FEOJ suppressed the activities of MMP-2 and -9 in a dose-dependent manner, which came from the activation of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) by FEOJ. FEOJ suppressed migration and invasion by suppressing PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Taken together, this study suggest that FEOJ suppresses cancer migration and invasion by tightening TJs through the suppression of claudin expression, and by suppressing MMPs in LnCaP human prostate cancer cells, which at least in part results from the suppression of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.""","""['Dong Yeok Shin', 'Won Sup Lee', 'Ji Hyun Jung', 'Su Hyun Hong', 'Cheol Park', 'Hye Jung Kim', 'Gi-Young Kim', 'Hye Jin Hwang', 'Gon Sup Kim', 'Jin-Myung Jung', 'Chung Ho Ryu', 'Sung Chul Shin', 'Soon Chan Hong', 'Yung Hyun Choi']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Int J Mol Sci""","""['Flavonoids from Orostachys japonicus A.

As the prostate is an androgen-dependent organ, we investigated the effect of the use of tamsulosin in combination with ketoconazole in cases of acute urinary retention (AUR) due to benign prostatic obstruction (BPO).  Methods:   We recruited patients with AUR secondary to BPO but those with hepatic or renal impairment were excluded. Following urethral catheterization, the participants were randomized into two equal groups. The first group received tamsulosin (0.4 mg o.d.) and ketoconazole (200 mg t.d.s.) while the second one had tamsulosin and placebo. The drugs were maintained for 7 days and then the patients were put on trial without catheter (TWOC). The successful cases were assessed with peak flow rate (PFR) and the post-void residual urine volume (PVRV) was also estimated.  Results:   We included 106 men with a mean age of 64.1±5.2 years and a mean prostate size of 61.6±14.6 g in the two groups. The received medications were well tolerated by all patients and none of them had discontinued the prescribed drugs. The incidence of the successful TWOC was significantly higher in the combined treatment group (77.35%) compared to the tamsulosin group (58.84%; P=0.01). Among those who had a successful TWOC, the PFR and the PVRV were also significantly better in the combined treatment group compared to the other one (P=0.001).

In this study, we determined the levels of dioxin biological toxicity using toxic equivalency (TEQ) values and examined the impact of dioxin-TEQ level on BCR.  Methods:   A total of 93 men who underwent RP, with a median of 5.3 years of postoperative follow-up, were included in the study. The dioxin-TEQ level of each patient was measured using intraoperatively harvested abdominal subcutaneous fat. The dichotomous categorization of dioxin-TEQ by the 50th percentile (low<50% vs high 50%) was also used to regroup the patient cohort, regardless of the previous history of AO exposure. Comparisons between the dioxin-TEQ levels, clinicopathological characteristics and BCR in AO-exposed and -unexposed men were made to allocate possible risk factors. The multivariable logistic regression model was used to identify significant risk factors associated with BCR, adjusting for other confounding factors.  Results:   The median dioxin-TEQ level in 37 AO-exposed patients was significantly higher than that in 56 unexposed patients (22.3 vs 15.0 pg g(-1) fat, respectively, P<0.001). The men with AO exposure were more likely to have a high dioxin-TEQ level (P<0.001). Neither AO exposure nor the level of dioxin-TEQ was associated with BCR. Tumor stage (T3/T4 vs T2) and Gleason grade (Gleason 3+4) were independent risk factors for BCR after RP.  Conclusions:   Exposure to AO significantly increases the adipose level of dioxin-TEQ in patients treated with RP. However, exposure to AO or a high dioxin-TEQ level was not associated with an increased risk of BCR after RP. This lack of association supports the current conclusion that the evidence of carcinogenicity of AO in prostate cancer patients is not sufficient and remains 'limited'.""","""['Q Li', 'L Lan', 'Z Klaassen', 'S R Shah', 'K A Moses', 'M K Terris']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['Agent Orange and long-term outcomes after radical prostatectomy.', 'Agent Orange exposure, Vietnam War veterans, and the risk of prostate cancer.', 'Exposure to Agent Orange is a significant predictor of prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-based recurrence and a rapid PSA doubling time after radical prostatectomy.', 'Does Agent Orange cause birth defects?', 'Agent Orange.

However, whether NKG2D ligands contribute to tumor suppression or progression clinically remains controversial. Here, we have described 2 novel lines of ""humanized"" bi-transgenic (bi-Tg) mice in which native human NKG2D ligand MHC class I polypeptide-related sequence B (MICB) or the engineered membrane-restricted MICB (MICB.A2) was expressed in the prostate of the transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate (TRAMP) model of spontaneous carcinogenesis. Bi-Tg TRAMP/MICB mice exhibited a markedly increased incidence of progressed carcinomas and metastasis, whereas TRAMP/MICB.A2 mice enjoyed long-term tumor-free survival conferred by sustained NKG2D-mediated antitumor immunity. Mechanistically, we found that cancer progression in TRAMP/MICB mice was associated with loss of the peripheral NK cell pool owing to high serum levels of tumor-derived soluble MICB (sMICB). Prostate cancer patients also displayed reduction of peripheral NK cells and high sMIC levels. Our study has not only provided direct evidence in ""humanized"" mouse models that soluble and membrane-restricted NKG2D ligands pose opposite impacts on cancer progression, but also uncovered a mechanism of sMIC-induced impairment of NK cell antitumor immunity.

We evaluated the impact of smoking exposure on cancer specific survival in patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma treated with surgery.  Materials and methods:   From a prospectively maintained database at a single center we collected the characteristics of 1,625 patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma treated with surgery between 1995 through 2012. We determined the associations of smoking status with advanced disease, defined as AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) stage greater than 2, and with cancer specific survival.  Results:   The prevalence rate of current, former and never smoking at diagnosis was 16%, 30% and 54%, respectively. Of the patients 62% reported a smoking history of 20 pack-years or greater. Median followup in survivors was 4.5 years (IQR 2.2-7.9). On univariable analysis a smoking history of 20 pack-years or greater was associated with a significantly increased risk of advanced disease (OR 1.43, 95% CI 1.02-2.00). However, it did not achieve an independent association after adjusting for age and gender. Pathological stage and Fuhrman grade adversely affected cancer specific survival on multivariable competing risks analysis. Although the association between smoking and cancer specific survival did not achieve statistical significance on multivariable analysis, the direction of the central estimate (HR 1.5, 95% CI 0.89-2.52) suggested that smoking adversely impacts cancer specific survival. Current smokers faced a higher risk of death from another cause than never smokers (HR 1.93, 95% CI 1.29-2.88).

Of these men 403 were previously diagnosed with prostate cancer and were included in this study. They underwent a 14-core transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy as part of an active surveillance regimen. A nurse contacted all men within 14 days of biopsy, and information was collected on potential complications, antibiotics received and bacterial culture results.  Results:   Fourteen patients (3.5%) had infectious complications including 13 requiring hospitalization. Five patients had positive urine cultures, and fluoroquinolone resistant isolates were identified in 4 patients, including 2 with extended spectrum beta-lactamase producing isolates.

Comparison of genomic analyses (DNA) with paired transcriptomic studies (mRNA) is critical to evaluating the pathogenic processes that give rise to human disease. The ability to analyze both DNA and mRNA from the same sample is not only important for biologic interrogation but also to minimize variance (e.g., sample loss) unrelated to the biology. Existing methods for RNA and DNA purification from a single sample are typically time-consuming and labor intensive or require large sample sizes to split for separate RNA and DNA extraction procedures. Thus, there is a need for more efficient and cost-effective methods to purify both RNA and DNA from a single sample. To address this need, we have developed a technique, termed SNARE (Selective Nucleic Acid Removal via Exclusion), that uses pinned oil interfaces to simultaneous purify mRNA and DNA from a single sample. A unique advantage of SNARE is the elimination of dilutive wash and centrifugation processes that are fundamental to conventional methods where sample is typically discarded. This minimizes loss and maximizes recovery by allowing nondilutive reinterrogation of the sample. We demonstrate that SNARE is more sensitive than commercially available kits, robustly and repeatably achieving mRNA and DNA purification from extremely low numbers of cells for downstream analyses. In addition to sensitivity, SNARE is fast, easy to use, and cost-effective and requires no laboratory infrastructure or hazardous chemicals. We demonstrate the clinical utility of the SNARE with prostate cancer circulating tumor cells to demonstrate its ability to perform both genomic and transcriptomic interrogation on rare cell populations that would be difficult to achieve with any current method.""","""['Lindsay Strotman', ""Rachel O'Connell"", 'Benjamin P Casavant', 'Scott M Berry', 'Jamie M Sperger', 'Joshua M Lang', 'David J Beebe']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Anal Chem""","""['Centrifugation-Assisted Immiscible Fluid Filtration for Dual-Bioanalyte Extraction.', 'Reliability and performance of commercial RNA and DNA extraction kits for FFPE tissue cores.', 'Isolation of RNA and DNA from single preimplantation embryos and a small number of Mammalian oocytes for imprinting studies.', 'DNA, RNA, and protein extraction: the past and the present.', 'Miniaturization of molecular biological techniques for gene assay.', 'On-Chip Nucleic Acid Purification Followed by ddPCR for SARS-CoV-2 Detection.', 'SEEMLIS: a flexible semi-automated method for enrichment of methylated DNA from low-input samples.', 'A lab-on-a-chip platform for integrated extraction and detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in resource-limited settings.', 'Prospective Evaluation of Clinical Outcomes Using a Multiplex Liquid Biopsy Targeting Diverse Resistance Mechanisms in Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Phase II Multicenter Study of Enzalutamide in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer to Identify Mechanisms Driving Resistance.']"""

In this study, we investigated the role of suppressor of cytokine signaling 2 (SOCS2) as mediator of the cross talk between androgens and GH signals in the prostate and its potential role as tumor suppressor in prostate cancer (PCa). We observed that SOCS2 protein levels assayed by immunohistochemistry are elevated in hormone therapy-naive localized prostatic adenocarcinoma in comparison with benign tissue. In contrast, however, castration-resistant bone metastases exhibit reduced levels of SOCS2 in comparison with localized or hormone naive, untreated metastatic tumors. In PCa cells, SOCS2 expression is induced by androgens through a mechanism that requires signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 protein (STAT5) and androgen receptor-dependent transcription. Consequentially, SOCS2 inhibits GH activation of Janus kinase 2, Src and STAT5 as well as both cell invasion and cell proliferation in vitro. In vivo, SOCS2 limits proliferation and production of IGF-1 in the prostate in response to GH. Our results suggest that the use of GH-signaling inhibitors could be of value as a complementary treatment for castration-resistant PCa.

The canine model is primarily utilized for the study of the PCa molecular mechanisms and provides a natural animal model for the study of potential therapies. In humans, the PCa frequently exhibits mutations in the C-MYC and a reduced expression of the E-cadherin and NKX3.1 proteins. This study's objective was to evaluate the NKX3.1, C-MYC, and E-cadherin expression in the canine normal prostate, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), proliferative inflammatory atrophy (PIA) and PCa and to verify differences in expression and subcellular localization of these proteins in the prostatic carcinogenesis. A tissue microarray (TMA) slide was constructed, and immunohistochemistry with antibodies raised against C-MYC, NKX3.1, E-cadherin and p63 was performed using the peroxidase and DAB methods. The C-MYC protein expression was elevated in the cytoplasm and nuclei of the canine PCa and PIA compared with the normal prostate (P = 0.004. The NKX3.1 protein expression was reduced in 94.75% of the PCa and 100% of the PIA compared with the normal prostate (P = 0.0022). In fact, the expression of E-cadherin trended towards a decrease in carcinomas when compared to normal prostate and PIA. By immunohistochemistry, more p63-positive basal cells were observed in the PCa and PIA when compared with the normal prostate (P = 0.0002).

Some GH actions are mediated by the elaboration of IGF-1, which exerts effects by binding and activating the heterotetrameric tyrosine kinase growth factor receptor, IGF-1R. In addition to this GH-GHR-IGF-1-IGF-1R scheme, we have demonstrated in primary osteoblasts and in islet β-cells that then deletion or silencing of IGF-1R results in diminished GH-induced STAT5 phosphorylation, suggesting that the presence of IGF-1R may facilitate GH signaling. In this study, we explore potential roles for protein tyrosine phosphatase activity in modulating GH-induced signaling, comparing conditions in which IGF-1R is present or diminished. We confirm that in mouse primary osteoblasts harboring loxP sites flanking the IGF-1R gene, infection with an adenovirus that expresses the Cre recombinase results in IGF-1R deletion and diminished acute GH-induced STAT5 phosphorylation. Furthermore, we present a new model of IGF-1R silencing, in which expression of short hairpin RNA directed at IGF-1R greatly reduces IGF-1R abundance in LNCaP human prostate cancer cells. In both models, treatment with a chemical inhibitor of protein tyrosine phosphatase-1B (PTP-1B), but not one of src homology region 2 domain-containing phosphotase-1 (SHP-1) and SHP-2, reverses the loss of GH-induced STAT5 phosphorylation in cells lacking IGF-1R but has no effect in cells with intact IGF-1R. Furthermore, expression of either a dominant-negative PTP-1B or the PTP-1B-interacting inhibitory protein, constitutive photomorphogenesis 1, also rescues acute GH-induced STAT5 signaling in IGF-1R-deficient cells but has no effect in IGF-1R replete cells. By expressing a substrate-trapping mutant PTP-1B, we demonstrate that tyrosine phosphorylated Janus kinase-2 is a PTP-1B substrate only in cells lacking IGF-1R. Collectively, our data suggest that IGF-1R positively regulates acute GH signaling by preventing access of PTP-1B activity to Janus kinase 2 and thereby preventing PTP-1B-mediated suppression of GH-induced STAT5 activation.""","""['Yujun Gan', 'Yue Zhang', 'Ashiya Buckels', 'Andrew J Paterson', 'Jing Jiang', 'Thomas L Clemens', 'Zhong-Yin Zhang', 'Keyong Du', 'Yingzi Chang', 'Stuart J Frank']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Mol Endocrinol""","""['Human GH receptor-IGF-1 receptor interaction: implications for GH signaling.', 'Functional collaboration of insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R), but not insulin receptor (IR), with acute GH signaling in mouse calvarial cells.', 'Deletion of IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR) in primary osteoblasts reduces GH-induced STAT5 signaling.', 'Growth hormone pulse-activated STAT5 signalling: a unique regulatory mechanism governing sexual dimorphism of liver gene expression.', 'Human growth disorders associated with impaired GH action: Defects in STAT5B and JAK2.', 'Second-Generation Jak2 Inhibitors for Advanced Prostate Cancer: Are We Ready for Clinical Development?', 'Classical and novel GH receptor signaling pathways.', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factors Are Key Regulators of T Helper 17 Regulatory T Cell Balance in Autoimmunity.', 'New Insights from IGF-IR Stimulating Activity Analyses: Pathological Considerations.', 'Autocrine/paracrine actions of growth hormone in human melanoma cell lines.']"""

To evaluate the safety and quality of life after TOOKAD(®) Soluble VTP treatment in patients with localised prostate cancer.  Patients and methods:   Men (aged >18 years) diagnosed with localised prostate cancer, who were suitable for active surveillance, were invited to take part in the study. Patients who had received prior or current treatment for their cancer were excluded. There were two parts to the study: in part one, patients were assigned to one of two treatment groups based on the size of their prostates (patients with prostate size <60 mL would receive 4 mg/kg TOOKAD(®) Soluble and patients with prostate size ≥60 mL would receive 6 mg/kg TOOKAD(®) Soluble both activated with 200 J/cm light). In part two, patients were assigned to one of two treatment groups based on predefined criteria and received either 4 or 6 mg/kg TOOKAD(®) Soluble and 200 or 300 J/cm light. VTP was conducted under general anaesthesia using TOOKAD(®) Soluble administered intravenously and activated by light-diffusing fibres within the prostate via the perineum. Follow-up was conducted for 6 months. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) carried out at 1 week after VTP and transrectal prostate biopsy at 6 months were the key endpoints. Adverse event (AE) recording and patient-reported outcome measures were collected.  Results:   In all, 86 patients were enrolled in the study and 85 patients received treatment. Of the 85 treated patients, one patient discontinued (due to withdrawal of consent). At 6 months, 61/83 (74%) patients who underwent prostate biopsy had histopathology that was negative for prostate cancer (95% confidence interval (CI) 62.7-82.6%). Considering patients who received 4 mg/kg TOOKAD(®) Soluble and 200 J/cm light (unilateral), which are considered optimal treatment parameters, 38/46 (83%) patients had histopathology from the biopsies that was negative for prostate cancer at 6 months (95% CI 68.6-92.2%; P < 0.001). The mean percentage of necrosis of the targeted prostate tissue at 7 days after VTP was 78% overall (83 patients) with extraprostatic necrosis reported in 76% (63/83) of patients. Considering patients who received 4 mg/kg TOOKAD(®) Soluble and 200 J/cm light (unilateral), the mean 7-day necrosis percentage was 88% (46 patients) with extraprostatic necrosis reported in 72% (33/46) of patients. All occurrences of extraprostatic necrosis were considered clinically acceptable and none were associated with any clinical sequelae. The mean percentage prostate necrosis at 7 days was statistically significantly higher (P < 0.001) in patients treated with a therapeutic light density index (LDI) of ≥1 than those treated with a LDI of <1. The percentage of patients with negative biopsies at 6 months was also higher in patients treated with a therapeutic LDI of ≥1 than those treated with a LDI of <1 (78.6% and 63.0%, respectively). In all, 87% (75/86) of patients reported at least one treatment-emergent AE during the study. Most AEs were mild or moderate in intensity and considered related to the technical procedures of the study. No treated patients had hypotension or discontinued due to AEs. Eight patients (9.3%) had serious AEs; none resulted in discontinuation from the study.  Conclusions:   Biopsy data, post-treatment dynamic contrast-enhancement MRI at 1 week after VTP and analysis of the safety data have shown that 4 mg/kg TOOKAD(®) Soluble and 200 J/cm light are the optimal treatment conditions for the VTP procedure resulting in >80% of patients treated with this regimen having a negative biopsy at 6 months.

IL-27 is the most recently characterized member of the family of heterodimeric IL-12-related cytokines and has shown promise in halting tumor growth and mediating tumor regression in several cancer models, including prostate cancer. Prostate cancer is frequently associated with metastases to the bone, where the tumor induces a vicious cycle of communication with osteoblasts and osteoclasts to induce bone lesions, which are a significant cause of pain and skeletal-related events for patients, including a high fracture risk. We describe our findings in the effects of IL-27 gene delivery on prostate cancer cells, osteoblasts, and osteoclasts at different stages of differentiation. We applied the IL-27 gene delivery protocol in vivo utilizing sonoporation (sonodelivery) with the goal of treating and reducing the growth of prostate cancer at a bone metastatic site in vivo. We used a new model of immune-competent prostate adenocarcinoma and characterized the tumor growth reduction, gene expression, and effector cellular profiles. Our results suggest that IL-27 can be effective in reducing tumor growth, can help normalize bone structure, and can promote enhanced accumulation of effector cells in prostate tumors. These results are promising, because they are relevant to developing a novel IL-27-based strategy that can treat both the tumor and the bone, by using this simple and effective sonodelivery method for treating prostate tumor bone metastases.""","""['Olga Zolochevska', 'Jayne Ellis', 'Sangram Parelkar', 'Delphine Chan-Seng', 'Todd Emrick', 'Jingna Wei', 'Igor Patrikeev', 'Massoud Motamedi', 'Marxa L Figueiredo']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Hum Gene Ther""","""['Ligand-Mediated Targeting of Cytokine Interleukin-27 Enhances Its Bioactivity In\xa0Vivo.', 'Sonoporation delivery of interleukin-27 gene therapy efficiently reduces prostate tumor cell growth in vivo.', 'Interleukin-27 expression modifies prostate cancer cell crosstalk with bone and immune cells in vitro.', 'Pathogenesis and treatment of prostate cancer bone metastases: targeting the lethal phenotype.', 'Bone metastases in prostate cancer: a targeted approach.', 'Advances in the Development and the Applications of Nonviral, Episomal Vectors for Gene Therapy.', 'Reengineering Tumor Microenvironment with Sequential Interleukin Delivery.', 'Sonodelivery in Skeletal Muscle: Current Approaches and Future Potential.', 'In vivo gene delivery mediated by non-viral vectors for cancer therapy.', 'Ligand-Mediated Targeting of Cytokine Interleukin-27 Enhances Its Bioactivity In\xa0Vivo.']"""

This study, based in the quantification of approximately 280 molecular lipid species, provides the most extensive lipid analysis of cells and exosomes to date. Interestingly, major differences were found in the lipid composition of exosomes compared to parent cells. Exosomes show a remarkable enrichment of distinct lipids, demonstrating an extraordinary discrimination of lipids sorted into these microvesicles. In particular, exosomes are highly enriched in glycosphingolipids, sphingomyelin, cholesterol, and phosphatidylserine (mol% of total lipids). Furthermore, lipid species, even of classes not enriched in exosomes, were selectively included in exosomes. Finally, it was found that there is an 8.4-fold enrichment of lipids per mg of protein in exosomes.

In the present study, we reevaluated the usefulness of serum degradome analyses for searching peptide cancer biomarker candidates. Particular attention was paid to pre-analytical factors influencing the variability of determined peptide levels, including clotting time and control group selection. Studies were conducted on 44 and 86 serum samples collected from cancer patients and healthy individuals, respectively, using liquid chromatography electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS)-based analyses. We identified 1373 unique peptides, nearly 40% of which originated from five blood proteins: fibrinogen alpha chain, apolipoprotein A-IV (APOA4), complement C3, apolipoprotein A-I, and alpha-1-antitrypsin. A set of 118 and 88 peptides exhibited highly significant differences (adjusted p-value ≤ 0.01 and fold change ≥ 2) in pair-wise comparisons of control vs. prostate cancer and control vs. colorectal cancer, respectively, with 37 peptides displaying a consistent direction of change for these pair-wise comparisons. The levels of 67 peptides differed significantly in serum samples collected from healthy individuals immediately prior to colonoscopy and those who underwent colonoscopic examination at least four weeks earlier. Of them, 49 peptides originated from APOA4. Whereas earlier studies, including ours, have utilized fragments of fibrinopeptide A (FPA) to distinguish cancer from healthy cases, here we show that their absolute abundance is a sensitive indicator of clotting time.

It usually occurs as a complication of prostatic cancer treatment, whether this is by radiation therapy or surgery. It can also occur in patients with benign pathology of the prostate, inflammatory bowel disease, or Fournier's gangrene, and following pelvic trauma. RUF represents a challenge for the surgeon because spontaneous closure is a rare event. Several techniques have been described for surgical repair of fistula. The goal of the present study was to demonstrate that the York Mason posterior, transrectal correction of an iatrogenic RUF is a reliable approach that offers good postoperative outcomes.  Methods:   We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 39 patients who underwent York Mason repair from 1998 to 2012 at the University of Southern California (USC) and Campus Bio-Medico University of Rome (UCBM). The most frequent common causes of RUF were itemized, and statistical analysis was performed to determine correlations between the fistula's etiology and surgical outcome. Patients were then divided into two different cohorts: those who had undergone only one previous procedure (group 1) and those who had undergone two or more surgeries (group 2). We performed a statistical analysis between the two groups and calculated the percentage of fistula repair by means of the posterior trans-sphincteric approach with the York Mason technique in each groups We evaluated the presence of comorbidities (diabetes and infection) and their influence on the surgical outcome. Finally, we reported patient outcomes during follow-up.  Results:   In the present series, the RUF was iatrogenic in every case. The onset of the fistula followed prostate cancer treatment, most commonly after laparoscopic procedures. The success rate of fistula repair was found to be independent of the fistula's etiology. Diabetes and infections did not influence the surgical outcome. Overall, more than 50 % of patients treated with the York Mason posterior, transanal, transrectal approach remained free of fistula during follow-up. Almost 90 % of those who were previously operated only once remained free of fistula.  Conclusions:   The posterior trans-sphincteric approach of the York Mason technique is effective in treating RUF.""","""['Cristina Falavolti', 'Federico Sergi', 'Ervin Shehu', 'Maurizio Buscarini']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""World J Surg""","""['York Mason procedure to repair iatrogenic rectourinary fistula.', 'Outcome of a modified York Mason technique in men with iatrogenic urethrorectal fistula after radical prostatectomy.', 'Mid term functional results following surgical treatment of recto-urinary fistulas postprostate cancer treatment.', 'Modified York-Mason technique for repair of iatrogenic rectourinary fistula: the montsouris experience.', 'Recto-urethral fistula secondary to prostate cancer.', 'Surgical treatment of rectourinary fistulas: review of the literature.', 'Outcomes of gracilis muscle interposition for rectourethral fistulas caused by treatment of prostate cancer.', 'Urorectal fistula repair using different approaches: operative results and quality of life issues.', 'Endoscopic Closure of a Large Rectovesical Fistula Following Robotic Prostatectomy.', 'Fistula surgery.', 'Rectourethral Fistula Secondary to Transurethral Resection of the Prostate.']"""

Despite the many medical treatments for erectile dysfunction, many couples report that they are dissatisfied with their sexual relationship and eventually cease sexual relations altogether. We sought to understand what distinguishes successful couples from those who are not successful in adjusting to changes in sexual function subsequent to PrCa treatment. Ten couples who maintained satisfying sexual intimacy after PrCa treatment and seven couples that did not were interviewed conjointly and individually. Interviews were transcribed and analyzed using grounded theory methodology. The theory that resulted suggests that individuals are motivated to engage in sex primarily because of physical pleasure and relational intimacy. The couples who valued sex primarily for relational intimacy were more likely to successfully adjust to changes in sexual function than those who primarily valued sex for physical pleasure. The attributes of acceptance, flexibility, and persistence helped sustain couples through the process of adjustment. Based on these findings, a new theory, the Physical Pleasure-Relational Intimacy Model of Sexual Motivation (PRISM) is presented. The results elucidate the main motives for engaging in sexual activity-physical pleasure and/or relational intimacy-as a determining factor in the successful maintenance of satisfying sexual intimacy after PrCa treatment. The PRISM model predicts that couples who place a greater value on sex for relational intimacy will better adjust to the sexual challenges after PrCa treatment than couples who place a lower value on sex for relational intimacy. Implications of the model for counselling are discussed. This model remains to be tested in future research.""","""['Andrea M Beck', 'John W Robinson', 'Linda E Carlson']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Arch Sex Behav""","""[""What couples say about their recovery of sexual intimacy after prostatectomy: toward the development of a conceptual model of couples' sexual recovery after surgery for prostate cancer."", 'Mood, sexuality, and relational intimacy after starting androgen deprivation therapy: implications for couples.', 'Prostate cancer patients and their partners: differences in satisfaction indices and psychological variables.', 'Sexual intimacy in heterosexual couples after prostate cancer treatment: What we know and what we still need to learn.', 'A biopsychosocial approach to sexual recovery after prostate cancer surgery: the role of grief and mourning.', 'Focusing on sexual rehabilitation besides penile rehabilitation following radical prostatectomy is important.', ""Psychosocial contributors to patients' and partners' postprostate cancer sexual recovery: 10 evidence-based and practical considerations."", ""The Ecology of Patients' Sexual Health Adjustment After Prostate Cancer Treatment: The Influence of the Social and Healthcare Environment."", 'On the Relationship Between Erectile Function and Sexual Distress in Men with Prostate Cancer.', 'Sexual motivations during the menopausal transition among Iranian women: a qualitative inquiry.']"""

We assess the impact of emergency presentation (EP) on the excess mortality in England over the course of the year following diagnosis.  Methods:   All colorectal and cervical cancers presenting in England and all breast, lung, and prostate cancers in the East of England in 2006-2008 are included. The variation in the likelihood of EP with age, stage, sex, co-morbidity, and income deprivation is modelled. The excess mortality over 0-1, 1-3, 3-6, and 6-12 months after diagnosis and its dependence on these case-mix factors and presentation route is then examined.  Results:   More advanced stage and older age are predictive of EP, as to a lesser extent are co-morbidity, higher income deprivation, and female sex. In the first month after diagnosis, we observe case-mix-adjusted excess mortality rate ratios of 7.5 (cervical), 5.9 (colorectal), 11.7 (breast ), 4.0 (lung), and 20.8 (prostate) for EP compared with non-EP.  Conclusion:   Individuals who present as an emergency experience high short-term mortality in all cancer types examined compared with non-EPs. This is partly a case-mix effect but EP remains predictive of short-term mortality even when age, stage, and co-morbidity are accounted for.""","""['S McPhail', 'L Elliss-Brookes', 'J Shelton', 'A Ives', 'M Greenslade', 'S Vernon', 'E J A Morris', 'M Richards']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Br J Cancer""","""['Stage at diagnosis and early mortality from cancer in England.', 'Diagnostic intervals and its association with breast, prostate, lung and colorectal cancer survival in England: historical cohort study using the Clinical Practice Research Datalink.', 'Impact of socioeconomic status on cancer incidence and stage at diagnosis: selected findings from the surveillance, epidemiology, and end results: National Longitudinal Mortality Study.', 'Risk factors for emergency presentation with lung and colorectal cancers: a systematic review.', 'Screening of cancer of the most frequent localizations.', 'Regional variation in routes to diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma in England from 2006 to 2017.', 'Colorectal Surgery Outcomes in the United States During the COVID-19 Pandemic.', 'Influence of COVID-19 Pandemic on Colorectal Cancer Presentation, Management and Outcome during the COVID-19 Pandemic.', 'The Consequences of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Emergency Surgery for Colorectal Cancer.', 'Diagnosing cancer earlier: what progress is being made?']"""

Height and weight were measured to compute BMI, PV was measured by transrectal ultrasound, and the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) questionnaire was administered. After stratified bivariate analyses, multiple linear regression and ordinal logistic regression models were used to assess the independent effect of BMI on PV and IPSS, respectively.  Results:   The cohort included 1613 patients, and mean BMI was 27.1 kg/m(2). Patients with a BMI of <25.0, 25.0-29.9, and 30.0-34.9 had a median PV of 44.0 mL, 48.0 mL, and 52.0 mL, respectively.

Methods and materials:   In the database, 4547 patients underwent brachytherapy (3094 for (125)I, 1437 for (103)Pd, and 16 for (131)Cs). The original prostate postimplant dosimetry was reported using the maximum dose covering 90% of the prostate volume (D90) and the percentage of the prostate volume covered by the prescription dose (V100). Retrospectively, the dosimetry of all implants was recalculated after segmenting the prostate into 12 sectors (anterior, left and right lateral and posterior, about the center of gravity, and subdivided lengthwise into three-base, midgland, and apex). The dosimetric quality of each sector and combinations of sectors was compared across radionuclides.  Results:   For each radionuclide, there was no significant difference between monotherapy and boost in terms of V100 or D90. When classified as excellent (V100 ≥ 90%), standard (V100 ≥ 80%), or minimal (V100 < 80%), 33.0%, 4.6%, and 10.5% of all base, midgland, and apical sectors, respectively, were of minimal quality. Specifically, 59.2% of the anterior base and 30.3% of the posterior base sectors were minimal. At the anterior midgland and apex, 22% and 19% of sectors were minimal. Excellent quality was observed in more than 90% of lateral and posterior midgland sectors and in >70% of lateral and posterior sectors. When stratified by (103)Pd vs. (125)I, sector analysis did not result in clinically significant dosimetric differences.  Conclusions:   Coverage of base sectors was inferior to midgland and apical sectors, and coverage of anterior sectors was notably inferior to lateral and posterior sectors. Further critique of brachytherapy planning and intraoperative technique is necessary for brachytherapists to minimize these dosimetric differences.""","""['Gregory S Merrick', 'Wayne M Butler', 'Peter Grimm', 'Mallory Morris', 'Jonathan H Lief', 'Abbey Bennett', 'Ryan Fiano']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Brachytherapy""","""['Effect of prostate size and isotope selection on dosimetric quality following permanent seed implantation.', 'Sector analysis provides additional spatial information on the permanent prostate brachytherapy learning curve.', 'Initial analysis of Pro-Qura: a multi-institutional database of prostate brachytherapy dosimetry.', 'Dosimetric differences between intraoperative and postoperative plans using Cs-131 in transrectal ultrasound-guided brachytherapy for prostatic carcinoma.', 'The American Brachytherapy Society recommendations for permanent prostate brachytherapy postimplant dosimetric analysis.', 'Correlations of post-implant regional dosimetric parameters at 24 hours and one month, with clinical results of low-dose-rate brachytherapy for localized prostate cancer.', 'Comparison of implant quality between intraoperatively built custom-linked seeds and loose seeds in permanent prostate brachytherapy using sector analysis.', 'Multisector dosimetry in the immediate post-implant period: significant under dosage of the prostate base.', 'Permanent prostate brachytherapy extracapsular radiation dose distributions: analysis of a multi-institutional database.']"""

One-directional lateral scan SECM was used as a rapid and reproducible tool for simultaneous mapping of cell topography and reactive oxygen species (ROS) release. Fluorescence microscopy was used in tandem to monitor the tip position, in addition to providing information on intracellular ROS content via the use of ROS-reactive fluorescent dyes. A unique tip current (iT) vs lateral distance profile was observed when the tip potential (ET) was set at -0.65 V. This profile reflects the combined effects of topographical change and ROS release at the PC3 cell surfaces. Differentiation between topographical-related and ROS-induced current change was achieved by comparing the scans collected at -0.65 and -0.85 V. The effects of other parameters such as tip to cell distance, solvent oxygen content, and scan direction on the profile of the scan were systematically evaluated. Cells treated with tert-butyl hydroperoxide, a known ROS stimulus, were also evaluated using the lateral scanning approach. Overall, the SECM results correlate well with the fluorescence results. The extracellular ROS level detected at the SECM tip was found to be similar to the intracellular ROS level monitored using fluorescence microscopy. While the concentration of each contributing ROS species has not been determined and is thus part of the future study, here we have successfully demonstrated the use of a simple two-potential lateral scan approach for analysis of ROS released by living cells under real physiological conditions.""","""['S Ehsan Salamifar', 'Rebecca Y Lai']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Anal Chem""","""['Deconvoluting topography and spatial physiological activity of live macrophage cells by scanning electrochemical microscopy in constant-distance mode.', 'Cisplatin effects on evolution of reactive oxygen species from single human bladder cancer cells investigated by scanning electrochemical microscopy.', '4D shearforce-based constant-distance mode scanning electrochemical microscopy.', 'Single live cell topography and activity imaging with the shear-force-based constant-distance scanning electrochemical microscope.', 'Electrochemical quantification of reactive oxygen and nitrogen: challenges and opportunities.', ""Enhancing scanning electrochemical microscopy's potential to probe dynamic co-culture systems via hyperspectral assisted-imaging."", 'Nanoelectrochemical quantification of single-cell metabolism.', 'Scanning electrochemical microscopy and its potential for studying biofilms and antimicrobial coatings.', 'Electrochemical Response of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Corresponds to Cell Viability upon Exposure to Dioclea reflexa Seed Extracts and Antifungal Drugs.', 'Biological imaging with scanning electrochemical microscopy.']"""

However, the technique of extirpation can differ based on the usage of thermal energy and coagulation during RARP, which may alter the risk of finding a positive surgical margin (PSM) as cautery may destroy residual cancer cells. We sought to evaluate whether the method of surgery (RP vs RARP) affects the rate of biochemical recurrence (BCR) in patients with PSMs.  Materials & methods:   The Columbia University Urologic Oncology Database was reviewed to identify patients who underwent RP and RARP from 2000 to 2010 and had a PSM on final pathology. BCR was defined as a postoperative prostate-specific antigen (PSA) ≥0.2 ng/mL. The Kaplan-Meier analysis was utilized to calculate BCR rates based on the method of surgery. Cox regression analysis was performed to determine if the method of surgery was associated with BCR.  Results:   We identified 3267 patients who underwent prostatectomy, of which 910 (28%) had a PSM. Of those with a PSM, 337 patients had available follow-up data, including 229 who underwent RP (68%) and 108 who underwent RARP (32%). At a mean follow-up time of 37 months for the RP group, 103 (46%) patients demonstrated BCR; at a mean follow-up time of 44 months for the RARP group, 62 (57%) patients had a BCR (p=0.140). Two-year BCR-free rates for RP vs RARP were 65% and 49%, respectively (log-rank p<0.001). However, after controlling for age, PSA, grade, and year of surgery, the surgical method was not significantly associated with increased risk of BCR (HR 1.25; p=0.29).  Conclusion:   Our results confirm the noninferiority of RARP to RP with regard to patients with PSMs. As such, all patients with a PSM at RP are at high risk for BCR and should be followed in the same manner regardless of the surgical approach.""","""['Edan Y Shapiro', 'Kyle Scarberry', 'Trushar Patel', 'Ari Bergman', 'Jennifer J Ahn', 'Nilesh Sahi', 'Arindam RoyChoudhury', 'Israel Deutch', 'James M McKiernan', 'Mitchell C Benson', 'Ketan K Badani']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Endourol""","""['Predictive factors and oncological outcomes of persistently elevated prostate-specific antigen in patients following robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Favorable risk factors in patients with positive surgical margin after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Learning curve of minimally invasive radical prostatectomy: Comprehensive evaluation and cumulative summation analysis of oncological outcomes.', 'Systematic review and meta-analysis of studies reporting oncologic outcome after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Positive surgical margins in radical prostatectomy: outlining the problem and its long-term consequences.', 'Biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy: Current status of its use as a treatment endpoint and early management strategies.', 'Prostatectomies for localized prostate cancer: a mixed comparison network and cumulative meta-analysis.', 'Robotic vs. Retropubic radical prostatectomy in prostate cancer: A systematic review and an meta-analysis update.', 'Wrong to be Right: Margin Laterality is an Independent Predictor of Biochemical Failure After Radical Prostatectomy.']"""

Methods:   We retrospectively identified 79 consecutive patients who received docetaxel-based chemotherapy at our institution. The treatment protocols included docetaxel 75 mg/m² every 21 days, with either prednisone 5 mg twice daily or estramustine 280 mg three times daily on days 1-5; treatment with dexamethasone preceded docetaxel therapy. All PSA values were determined before every cycle of docetaxel-based treatment.  Results:   According to changes in tPSA level, 79 patients were divided into 3 groups: response (group 1), progression (group 2) and flare-up (group 3). fPSA and tPSA levels showed different patterns in groups 1, 2 and 3. Changes in fPSA level were independent of the changes in tPSA level in group 3, which decreased during chemotherapy. However, comparing with fPSA changes in group 3, changes in fPSA level were in accordance with tPSA changes in groups 1 and 2.

Median survival for patients in groups 1 (P = 0.008 vs group 2) and 3 (P = 0.029 vs group 2) is significantly longer than for patients who experienced progressive disease under therapy. However, there was no statistically significant difference in survival between groups 1 and 3.

We explored the mechanisms of cell death induced by Tan-IIA treatment in prostate cancer cells in vitro and in vivo.  Methods:   Cells were treated with Tan-IIA and growth inhibition was assessed. Cell cycle profiles after Tan-IIA treatment were determined by flow cytometry. Expression levels of cell cycle regulatory proteins and apoptosis-related proteins were determined after Tan-IIA treatment. Expression levels of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-regulated genes were determined to investigate their role in Tan-IIA-induced cell death. GADD153 expression was knocked down by small interfering RNA (siRNA) transfection. Rate of cell death and proliferation was obtained by 3-(4,5-dimethyl thizol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide assay. Antitumor activity of Tan-IIA was performed in LNCaP xenograft model.  Results:   Our results showed that Tan-IIA caused prostate cancer cell death in a dose-dependent manner, and cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase was noted, in LNCaP cells. The G0/G1 phase arrest correlated with increase levels of CDK inhibitors (p16, p21 and p27) and decrease of the checkpoint proteins. Tan-IIA also induced ER stress in prostate cancer cells: activation and nuclear translocation of GADD153/CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-homologous protein (CHOP) were identified, and increased expression of the downstream molecules GRP78/BiP, inositol-requiring protein-1α and GADD153/CHOP were evidenced. Blockage of GADD153/CHOP expression by siRNA reduced Tan-IIA-induced cell death in LNCaP cells. Tan-IIA also suppressed LNCaP xenograft tumor growth, causing 86.4% reduction in tumor volume after 13 days of treatment.  Conclusions:   Our findings suggest that Tan-IIA causes G0/G1 cell cycle arrest in LNCaP cells and its cytotoxicity is mediated at least partly by ER stress induction. These data provide evidence supporting Tan-IIA as a potential anticancer agent by inducing ER stress in prostate cancer.""","""['S C Chiu', 'S Y Huang', 'S P Chen', 'C C Su', 'T L Chiu', 'C Y Pang']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['Tanshinone IIA inhibits BT-20 human breast cancer cell proliferation through increasing caspase 12, GADD153 and phospho-p38 protein expression.', 'Activation of p53 signaling and inhibition of androgen receptor mediate tanshinone IIA induced G1 arrest in LNCaP prostate cancer cells.', 'Tanshinone IIA inhibits human gastric carcinoma AGS cell growth by decreasing BiP, TCTP, Mcl‑1 and Bcl‑xL and increasing Bax and CHOP protein expression.', 'Antitumor effect of traditional Chinese herbal medicines against lung cancer.', 'Traditional Chinese medicine targeting apoptotic mechanisms for esophageal cancer therapy.', 'Tanshinone IIA targeting cell signaling pathways: a plausible paradigm for cancer therapy.', 'Marine Natural Products with Activities against Prostate Cancer: Recent Discoveries.', 'Salvia miltiorrhiza in cancer: Potential role in regulating MicroRNAs and epigenetic enzymes.', 'The endoplasmic reticulum stress response in prostate cancer.', 'Ribosome-Directed Therapies in Cancer.']"""

The aim of this study was to evaluate the distribution of the different treatment options in Germany.  Patients and methods:   Between October 2010 and May 2012 a questionnaire was sent to urologists in outpatient, general and university hospitals and rehabilitation hospitals in Germany. The survey consisted of various questions concerning, e.g. if and what kind of therapy urologists choose to support rehabilitation of EF after nsRP. Further questions dealt with the frequency, duration and optimal start of the chosen therapy.  Results:   Currently 188 urologists have completed and returned the questionnaire. The distribution was urologists in hospitals n=79 and outpatient/ambulatory n=106, with 24 % performing surgical treatment and urologists in rehabilitation hospitals n=3. The question about the rehabilitation concept showed 39 different forms of treatment within this group. To increase EF after nsRP PDE5 inhibitors were mostly administered (88 %) with 45 % on request compared to 55 %on a daily or regular basis ≥ 3 times/week. The use of penile injection therapy, medicated urethral system for erection (MUSE) and vacuum constriction devices (VCD) was prescribed by 32 %, 6 % and 30 % of urologists, respectively. Only 14 % of the urologists did not choose any active kind of rehabilitation treatment for EF recovery after nsRP.  Conclusion:   Many different therapeutic concepts are currently performed in Germany to increase EF recovery after nsRP. The use of PDE5 inhibitors is the most commonly chosen treatment option.

Here, we used two cell lines, one (E8) isolated from a primary tumor and the other (cE1) from a recurrent tumor arising at the primary site, both from the conditional Pten deletion mouse model of prostatic adenocarcinoma. Over-expression of the BMP antagonist noggin inhibited proliferation of cE1 cells in vitro while enhancing their ability to migrate. On the other hand, cE1/noggin grafts grown in vivo showed a greater mass and a higher proliferation index than the cE1/control grafts. For suppression of BMP activity in the context of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), we used noggin-transduced CAFs from the same mouse model to determine their effect on E8- or cE1-induced tumor growth. CAF/noggin led to increased tumor mass and greater de-differentiation of the E8 cell when compared with tumors formed in the presence of CAF/control cells. A trend of increase in the size of the tumor was also noted for cE1 cells when inoculated with CAF/noggin. Together, the results may point to a potential inhibitory role of BMP in the growth or re-growth of prostate tumor at the primary site. Additionally, results for cE1/noggin, and cE1 mixed with CAF/noggin, suggested that suppression of BMP activity in the cancer cells may have a stronger growth-enhancing effect on the tumor than its suppression in the fibroblastic compartment of the tumor microenvironment.""","""['Linda Kim Pham', 'Mengmeng Liang', 'Helty A Adisetiyo', 'Chun-Peng Liao', 'Michael B Cohen', 'Stanley M Tahara', 'Baruch Frenkel', 'Noriyuki Kasahara', 'Pradip Roy-Burman']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Endocr Relat Cancer""","""['Influence of BMPs on the formation of osteoblastic lesions in metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Exploration of Shh and BMP paracrine signaling in a prostate cancer xenograft.', 'A novel bone morphogenetic protein signaling in heterotypic cell interactions in prostate cancer.', 'Overexpression of noggin inhibits BMP-mediated growth of osteolytic prostate cancer lesions.', 'Prostate cancer dormancy and recurrence.', 'Mimicking Tumor Cell Heterogeneity of Colorectal Cancer in a Patient-derived Organoid-Fibroblast Model.', 'Signaling pathways in cancer-associated fibroblasts and targeted therapy for cancer.', 'Exosomes Released by Gastric Cancer Cells Induce Transition of Pericytes Into Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts.', 'Strategies to avoid treatment-induced lineage crisis in advanced prostate cancer.', 'Identification of Androgen Receptor Splice Variants in the Pten Deficient Murine Prostate Cancer Model.']"""

To characterize the registration uncertainties between the two imaging modalities and explore the possibility of performing the procedure solely on TRUS.  Methods and materials:   Patients were treated with a TRUS/CBCT-based HDR brachytherapy procedure. For 100 patients, dosimetric results were analyzed. For 40 patients, registration uncertainties were examined by determining differences in fiducial marker positions on TRUS and registered CBCT. The accuracy of needle reconstruction on TRUS was investigated by determining the position differences of needle tips on TRUS and CBCT. The dosimetric impact of reregistration and needle reconstruction on TRUS only was studied for 8 patients.  Results:   The average prostate V100 was 97.8%, urethra D10 was 116.3%, and rectum D1 cc was 66.4% of the prescribed dose. For 85% of the patients, registration inaccuracies were within 3 mm. Large differences were found between needle tips on TRUS and CBCT, especially in cranial-caudal direction, with a maximum of 10.4 mm. Reregistration resulted in a maximum V100 reduction of 0.9%, whereas needle reconstruction on TRUS only gave a maximum reduction of 9.4%.  Conclusions:   HDR prostate brachytherapy based on TRUS combined with CBCT is an accurate method.

Here we demonstrate that OSU-A9, an I3C derivative with improved anticancer potency, induces cytotoxicity in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines (HL-60 and THP-1) and primary leukemia cells from AML patients in a dose-responsive manner. Normal human bone marrow cells were less sensitive to OSU-A9 than leukemia cells. OSU-A9 induces caspase activation, PARP cleavage, and autophagy but not autophagic cell death. Interestingly, pretreatment of AML cell lines and primary AML cells with N-acetylcysteine or glutathione rescues them from apoptosis (and concomitant PARP cleavage) and Akt hypophosphorylation, implicating a key role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in OSU-A9-related cytotoxicity. Importantly, the anticancer utility of OSU-A9 is extended in vivo as it, administered intraperitoneally, suppresses the growth of THP-1 xenograft tumors in athymic nude mice without obvious toxicity.

The chiral inversion pathway consists of conversion of the drug to the coenzyme A ester (by an acyl-CoA synthetase) followed by chiral inversion by α-methylacyl-CoA racemase (AMACR; P504S). The enzymes responsible for hydrolysis of the product S-2-APA-CoA ester to the active S-2-APA drug have not been identified. In this study, conversion of a variety of 2-APA-CoA esters by human acyl-CoA thioesterase-1 and -2 (ACOT-1 and -2) was investigated. Human recombinant ACOT-1 and -2 (ACOT-1 and -2) were both able to efficiently hydrolyse a variety of 2-APA-CoA substrates. Studies with the model substrates R- and S-2-methylmyristoyl-CoA showed that both enzymes were able to efficiently hydrolyse both of the epimeric substrates with (2R)- and (2S)- methyl groups. ACOT-1 is located in the cytosol and is able to hydrolyse 2-APA-CoA esters exported from the mitochondria and peroxisomes for inhibition of cyclo-oxygenase-1 and -2 in the endoplasmic reticulum. It is a prime candidate to be the enzyme responsible for the pharmacological action of chiral inverted drugs. ACOT-2 activity may be important in 2-APA toxicity effects and for the regulation of mitochondrial free coenzyme A levels.

One of the main reasons for the ineffective anti-prostate cancer treatments is the failure to deplete cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) - a subset of cancer cells with enhanced tumorigenic capacity. Thus, combination of agents against both CSCs and bulk tumor cells may offer better therapeutic benefits. Several molecules with anti-cancer stem/progenitor cell activities have been under preclinical evaluations. However, their low solubility and nonspecific toxicity limit their clinical translation. Herein, we designed a combination macromolecular therapy containing two drug conjugates: HPMA copolymer-cyclopamine conjugate (P-CYP) preferentially toxic to cancer stem/progenitor cells, and HPMA copolymer-docetaxel conjugate (P-DTX) effective in debulking the tumor mass. Both conjugates were synthesized using RAFT (reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer) polymerization resulting in narrow molecular weight distribution. The killing effects of the two conjugates against bulk tumor cells and CSCs were evaluated in vitro and in vivo. In PC-3 or RC-92a/hTERT prostate cancer cells, P-CYP preferentially kills and impairs the function of CD133+ prostate cancer stem/progenitor cells; P-DTX was able to kill bulk tumor cells instead of CSCs. In a PC-3 xenograft mice model, combination of P-DTX and P-CYP showed the most effective and persistent tumor growth inhibitory effect. In addition, residual tumors contained less CD133+ cancer cells following combination or P-CYP treatments, indicating selective killing of cancer cells with stem/progenitor cell properties.""","""['Yan Zhou', 'Jiyuan Yang', 'Johng S Rhim', 'Jindřich Kopeček']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Control Release""","""['Selective inhibitory effect of HPMA copolymer-cyclopamine conjugate on prostate cancer stem cells.', 'Combination therapy of prostate cancer with HPMA copolymer conjugates containing PI3K/mTOR inhibitor and docetaxel.', 'Spacer length impacts the efficacy of targeted docetaxel conjugates in prostate-specific membrane antigen expressing prostate cancer.', 'The Utility of Chemotherapy in the Treatment of Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Ex vivo culture of human prostate tissue and drug development.', 'State-of-the-art therapeutic strategies for targeting cancer stem cells in prostate cancer.', 'Natural Products-Based Nanoformulations: A New Approach Targeting CSCs to Cancer Therapy.', 'Perspectives of nano-carrier drug delivery systems to overcome cancer drug resistance in the clinics.', 'Recent advances in drug delivery systems for targeting cancer stem cells.', 'Polymer Therapeutics: Biomarkers and New Approaches for Personalized Cancer Treatment.']"""

Although diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) have good diagnostic performance, perfect tumour detection is challenging. In this study, we investigated the variation in prostate tissue characteristics Gleason score (GS), cell density (CD) and microvessel density (MVD) to explain the limitations in tumour voxel detection with a MRI-based logistic regression model.  Material and methods:   Twelve radical prostatectomy patients underwent a pre-operative 3.0T DWI and DCE-MRI exam. The MRI scans were used to calculate voxel-wise tumour probability with a logistic regression model for the peripheral zone (PZ) of the prostate. Tumour probability maps were correlated and validated with whole-mount histology. Additionally, from the whole-mount histological sections CD, MVD and GS were retrieved for every single voxel. GS, CD and MVD of true- and false-positive voxels and of true- and false-negative voxels were compared using Mann-Whitney U-tests.  Results:   False-negative tumour voxels had significantly lower CD and MVD (p < 0.0001) and were similar to non-tumour PZ. True-positive detected tumour voxels had high CDs and MVDs (p < 0.0001). In addition, tumour voxels with higher GS showed a trend towards more frequent detection (p = 0.06). Tumour voxels with GS ≥ 3 + 4 showed higher CD and MVD compared to tumour voxels with GS 3 + 3 (p < 0.0001).  Conclusion:   Tumour voxels with low CD and MVD resemble healthy tissue and are limiting tumour voxel detection using DWI and DCE-MRI. Nevertheless, the most aggressive tumour voxels, containing high CD, MVD and GS, are more likely to be detected and can therefore be treated with high dose using focal therapy or focal boosting.""","""['Alie Borren', 'Greetje Groenendaal', 'Maaike R Moman', 'Arto E Boeken Kruger', 'Paul J van Diest', 'Marco van Vulpen', 'Marielle E P Philippens', 'Uulke A van der Heide']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Acta Oncol""","""['Why prostate tumour delineation based on apparent diffusion coefficient is challenging: an exploration of the tissue microanatomy.', 'Usefulness of diffusion-weighted imaging and dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging in the diagnosis of prostate transition-zone cancer.', 'Prostate cancer detection with multi-parametric MRI: logistic regression analysis of quantitative T2, diffusion-weighted imaging, and dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI.', 'Advances in magnetic resonance imaging: how they are changing the management of prostate cancer.', 'Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging of the prostate: technical aspects and role in clinical management.', 'Robust dose-painting-by-numbers vs. nonselective dose escalation for non-small cell lung cancer patients.', 'Histopathological features of prostate cancer conspicuity on multiparametric MRI: protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Conspicuity of prostate cancer on multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging: A cross-disciplinary translational hypothesis.', 'Use of Imaging to Optimise Prostate Cancer Tumour Volume Assessment for Focal Therapy Planning.', 'Analysis of outcomes after non-contour-based dose painting of dominant intra-epithelial lesion in intra-operative low-dose rate brachytherapy.']"""

The EphA1 transcript expression in prostate cancer cell lines was detected by Quantitative real-time PCR. The expression of EphA1 protein in 138 prostate cancer tissue samples and 21 benign prostate hyperplasia samples were checked by using immunohistochemical staining. EphA1 mRNA was high expressed in LNCap, moderately expressed in 22RV1 and Du145, and lost in PC3. Loss of expression of EphA1 transcript was related to hypermethylation of CpG island around the translation start site. EphA1 protein was differentially expressed in prostate cancers and hyperplasia. Increased expression of EphA1 protein was more frequently detected in prostate cancers than in hyperplasia (P = 0.02), and more often detected in prostate cancer with high Gleason score (P < 0.001).

The Rac and Cdc42 pathways promote the uncontrolled proliferation, invasion and metastatic properties of human cancer cells. We synthesized the novel compound AZA1 based on structural information of the known Rac1 inhibitor NSC23766. In the current study we investigated the effects of inhibition of these pathways by AZA1 on prostate tumorigenicity by performing preclinical studies using a xenograft mouse model of prostate cancer. In androgen-independent prostate cancer cells, AZA1 inhibited both Rac1 and Cdc42 but not RhoA GTPase activity in a dose-dependent manner and blocked cellular migration and proliferation. Cyclin D1 expression significantly decreased following Rac1/Cdc42 inhibition in prostate cancer cells. AZA1 treatment also down-regulated PAK and AKT activity in prostate cancer cells, associated with induction of the pro-apoptotic function of BAD by suppression of serine-112 phosphorylation. Daily systemic administration of AZA1 for 2 weeks reduced growth of human 22Rv1 prostate tumor xenografts in mice and improved the survival of tumor-bearing animals significantly. These data suggest a role of AZA1 in blocking Rac1/Cdc42-dependent cell cycle progression, cancer cell migration and increase of cancer cell apoptosis involving down-regulation of the AKT and PAK signaling pathway in prostate cancer cells.

BMCC1 was initially annotated as two genes (C9orf65/PRUNE and BNIPXL) on either side of PCA3 but our data suggest that it represents a single gene coding for a high molecular weight protein. Here we demonstrate for the first time the expression of a >300 kDa BMCC1 protein (BMCC1-1) in prostate cancer and melanoma cell lines. This protein was found exclusively in the microsomal fraction and localised to cytoplasmic vesicles. We also observed expression of BMCC1 protein in prostate cancer sections using immunohistology. GST pull down, immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry protein interaction studies identified multiple members of the Adaptor Related Complex 2 (AP-2) as BMCC1 interactors. Consistent with a role for BMCC1 as an AP-2 interacting endosomal protein, BMCC1 co-localised with β-adaptin at the perinuclear region of the cell. BMCC1 also showed partial co-localisation with the early endosome small GTP-ase Rab-5 as well as strong co-localisation with internalised pulse-chase labelled transferrin (Tf), providing evidence that BMCC1 is localised to functional endocytic vesicles.

As regular green tea consumption has been associated with improved prognosis of breast cancer patients, including decreased risk of recurrence, here the effects of the green tea polyphenol epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) were tested on two IBC lines: SUM-149 and SUM-190. EGCG decreased expression of genes that promote proliferation, migration, invasion, and survival. Consistently, growth, invasive properties, and survival of IBC cells were reduced by EGCG treatment. EGCG also reduced lymphangiogenesis-promoting genes, in particular VEGF-D. Conditioned media from EGCG-treated IBC cells displayed decreased VEGF-D secretion and reduced ability to promote lymphangiogenesis in vitro as measured by hTERT-HDLEC lymphatic endothelial cell migration and tube formation. Tumorsphere formation by SUM-149 cells was robustly inhibited by EGCG, suggesting effects on self-renewal ability. Stem-like SUM-149 cells with high aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity, previously implicated in poor patient prognosis, were isolated. EGCG treatment reduced growth and induced apoptosis of the stem-like SUM-149 cells in culture. In an orthotopic mouse model, EGCG decreased growth of pre-existing tumors derived from ALDH-positive stem-like SUM-149 cells and their expression of VEGF-D, which correlated with a significant decrease in peritumoral lymphatic vessel density. Thus, EGCG inhibits the overall aggressive IBC phenotype. Reduction of the stem-like cell compartment by EGCG may explain the decreased risk of breast cancer recurrence among green tea drinkers. Recent clinical trials demonstrate the efficacy of green tea polyphenol extracts in treatment of prostate cancer and lymphocytic leukemia with low toxicity. Given the poor prognosis of IBC patients, our findings suggest further exploration of EGCG or green tea in combinatorial treatments against active IBC disease or in maintenance regimens to avoid recurrence is warranted.""","""['Nora D Mineva', 'K Eric Paulson', 'Stephen P Naber', 'Amy S Yee', 'Gail E Sonenshein']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['(-)-Epigallocatechin-3-gallate inhibits growth of gastric cancer by reducing VEGF production and angiogenesis.', 'Anti-cancer activities of tea epigallocatechin-3-gallate in breast cancer patients under radiotherapy.', 'Green tea polyphenols and its constituent epigallocatechin gallate inhibits proliferation of human breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo.', 'Inhibition of tumour invasion and angiogenesis by epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), a major component of green tea.', 'Green tea polyphenols: biology and therapeutic implications in cancer.', 'Anticarcinogenic potentials of tea catechins.', 'Green Tea Epigallocatechin-3-Gallate Regulates Autophagy in Male and Female Reproductive Cancer.', 'Targeting Breast Cancer Stem Cells Using Naturally Occurring Phytoestrogens.', 'Mechanistic evaluation of phytochemicals in breast cancer remedy: current understanding and future perspectives.', 'Regular Intake of Green Tea Polyphenols Suppresses the Development of Nonmelanoma Skin Cancer through miR-29-Mediated Epigenetic Modifications.']"""

The primary objective of this study was to determine if analysis of a large-sample of anonymous internet conversations (ICs) could be utilized to identify unmet public needs regarding AS.  Methods:   English-language ICs regarding prostate cancer (PC) treatment with AS from 2002-12 were identified using a novel internet search methodology. Web spiders were developed to mine, aggregate, and analyze content from the world-wide-web for ICs centered on AS. Collection of ICs was not restricted to any specific geographic region of origin. NLP was used to evaluate content and perform a sentiment analysis. Conversations were scored as positive, negative, or neutral. A sentiment index (SI) was subsequently calculated according to the following formula to compare temporal trends in public sentiment towards AS: [(# Positive IC/#Total IC)-(#Negative IC/#Total IC) x 100].  Results:   A total of 464 ICs were identified. Sentiment increased from -13 to +2 over the study period. The increase sentiment has been driven by increased patient emphasis on quality-of-life factors and endorsement of AS by national medical organizations. Unmet needs identified in these ICs include: a gap between quantitative data regarding long-term outcomes with AS vs. conventional treatments, desire for treatment information from an unbiased specialist, and absence of public role models managed with AS.  Conclusions:   This study demonstrates the potential utility of online patient communications to provide insight into patient preferences and decision-making. Based on our findings, we recommend that multidisciplinary clinics consider including an unbiased specialist to present treatment options and that future decision tools for AS include quantitative data regarding outcomes after AS.""","""['Mark V Mishra', 'Michele Bennett', 'Armon Vincent', 'Olivia T Lee', 'Costas D Lallas', 'Edouard J Trabulsi', 'Leonard G Gomella', 'Adam P Dicker', 'Timothy N Showalter']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['The experience of adults who choose watchful waiting or active surveillance as an approach to medical treatment: a qualitative systematic review.', 'Web Conversations About Complementary and Alternative Medicines and Cancer: Content and Sentiment Analysis.', 'SentiHealth-Cancer: A sentiment analysis tool to help detecting mood of patients in online social networks.', 'A systematic review of the unmet supportive care needs of men on active surveillance for prostate cancer.', 'An evidence review of active surveillance in men with localized prostate cancer.', ""Factors that influence clinicians' decisions to decrease active surveillance monitoring frequency or transition to watchful waiting for localised prostate cancer: a qualitative study."", 'Sentiment Analysis in Health and Well-Being: Systematic Review.', 'Is there any association between prostate-specific antigen screening frequency and uptake of active surveillance in men with low or very low risk prostate cancer?', 'Machine learning to support social media empowered patients in cancer care and cancer treatment decisions.', ""Factors Influencing Men's Choice of and Adherence to Active Surveillance for Low-risk Prostate Cancer: A Mixed-method Systematic Review.""]"""

However controversy persists regarding use of these parameters in cancer detection. Our aim is to evaluate PSAV as a predictor of PCa and intermediate/high grade PCa (HGPCa).  Methods:   We included 682 patients that underwent repeat transrectal ultrasound guided biopsy after initial negative biopsy. Univariate and multivariate analyses as well as area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC) were performed to assess predictive accuracy regarding detection of PCa and intermediate/HGPCa (Gleason score ≥ 7).

However, three large randomized controlled trials have reported conflicting results. Thus, we examined circulating vitamin E and vitamin E-related genes in relation to risk of high-grade prostate cancer and prostate cancer recurrence among men initially diagnosed with clinically organ-confined disease.  Methods:   We measured circulating α- and γ-tocopherol and genotyped 30 SNPs in SOD1, SOD2, SOD3, TTPA, and SEC14L2 among 573 men with organ-confined prostate cancer who underwent radical prostatectomy. We examined associations between circulating vitamin E, genotypes, and risk of high-grade prostate cancer (Gleason grade ≥ 8 or 7 with primary score ≥ 4; n = 117) using logistic regression, and risk of recurrence (56 events; 3.7 years median follow-up) using Cox proportional hazards regression.  Results:   Circulating γ-tocopherol was associated with an increased risk of high-grade prostate cancer (Q4 v. Q1 odds ratio [OR] = 1.87; 95% confidence intervals [CI]: 0.97-3.58; P trend =0.02). The less common allele in SOD3 rs699473 was associated with an increased risk of high-grade disease (T > C: OR = 1.40, 95% CI: 1.04-1.89). Two independent SNPs in SOD1 were inversely associated with prostate cancer recurrence in additive models (rs17884057 hazard ratio [HR] = 0.49, 95%CI: 0.25-0.96; rs9967983 HR = 0.62, 95% CI: 0.40-0.95).

However, little is known about the loss of AR gene expression itself and the possible contribution of AR negative cells to CRPC.  Methods:   Human and murine prostate cancer tissue microarrays (TMAs) were evaluated with antibodies specific for E2F1, DNA methyltransferase 1 or AR. The human prostate cancer TMA consisted of clinical samples ranging from normal tissue to samples of metastatic disease. The murine TMA was comprised of benign, localized or metastatic prostate cancer acquired from TRAMP mice treated with castration and/or 5'-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5Aza).  Results:   Immunohistochemical analysis revealed increased nuclear DNMT1 staining in localized PCa (P < 0.0001) and metastatic PCa (P < 0.0001) compared to normal tissue. Examination of specific diagnoses revealed that Gleason seven tumors exhibited greater nuclear DNMT1 staining than Gleason six tumors (P < 0.05) and that metastatic tissue exhibited greater levels of nuclear DNMT1 than Gleason seven tumors (P < 0.01). Evaluation of the murine tissue cores revealed that 8.2% and 8.1% of benign tissue cores stained positive for E2F1 and DNMT1 respectively, while 97.0% were AR positive. Conversely, 81% and 100% of tumors were positive for E2F1 and DNMT1 respectively. This was in stark contrast to only 18% of tumors positive for AR.

The etiology of prostate cancer is unknown, although both animal and epidemiologic data suggest that early life exposures to various toxicants, may impact DNA methylation status during development, playing an important role.  Methods:   We have developed a xenograft model to characterize the growth and differentiation of human fetal prostate implants (gestational age 12-24 weeks) that can provide new data on the potential role of early life stressors on prostate cancer. The expression of key immunohistochemical markers responsible for prostate maturation was evaluated, including p63, cytokeratin 18, α-smooth muscle actin, vimentin, caldesmon, Ki-67, prostate-specific antigen, estrogen receptor-α, and androgen receptor. Xenografts were separated into epithelial and stromal compartments using laser capture microdissection (LCM), and the DNA methylation status was assessed in >480,000 CpG sites throughout the genome.  Results:   Xenografts demonstrated growth and maturation throughout the 200 days of post-implantation evaluation. DNA methylation profiles of laser capture microdissected tissue demonstrated tissue-specific markers clustered by their location in either the epithelium or stroma of human prostate tissue. Differential methylated promoter region CpG-associated gene analysis revealed significantly more stromal than epithelial DNA methylation in the 30- and 90-day xenografts. Functional classification analysis identified CpG-related gene clusters in methylated epithelial and stromal human xenografts.

Estrogen in synergy with androgen is essential for cell growth of the normal and malignant prostate. However, the exact role that estrogen and the estrogen receptor play in prostate carcinogenesis remains unclear. We have previously demonstrated the metastasis-promoting effect of an estrogen receptor beta (ERβ) agonist (genistein) in a patient-derived PCa xenograft model mimicking localized and metastatic disease.  Methods:   To test the hypothesis that the tumor-promoting activity of genistein was due to its estrogenic properties, we treated the xenograft-bearing mice with genistein and an anti-estrogen compound (ICI 182, 780) and compared the differential gene expression using microarrays.  Results:   Using a second xenograft model which was derived from another patient, we showed that genistein promoted disease progression in vivo and ICI 182, 780 inhibited metastatic spread. The microarray analysis revealed that the metallothionein (MT) gene family was differentially expressed in tumors treated by these compounds. Using qRT-PCR, the differences in expression levels were validated in the metastatic and non-metastatic LTL313 PCa xenograft tumor lines, both of which were originally derived from the same PCa patient.

We performed a systematic analysis of the literature to ascertain the incidence and risk for alopecia in patients receiving endocrine therapies.

The cancer detection rate rose with the number of SNP risk alleles from 29% for men with no variant to 63% for men who carried seven or more risk alleles (OR = 4.2; p = 0.002). The SNP data did not improve the predictive power of clinical factors (age, PSA and DRE) for detecting prostate cancer (AUC: 0.726 vs. 0.735; p = 0.4). We were unable to define a group of men with a sufficiently low prevalence of prostate cancer that a biopsy might have been avoided.

Recently, stromal cell lines of the prostate, such as P21, were also introduced. Here we investigate a basic and important mechanism of living cells: Ca(2+) homeostasis in PC3, DU 145, and P21.  Methods:   We examined Ca(2+) clearance mechanisms by monitoring the kinetics of recovery from histamine stimulation under conditions which inhibit prospect mechanisms for storing or extrusion of Ca(2+) from the cytosol by photometry.  Results:   Despite the fact that in all three cell lines the Ca(2+) ATPase of the plasma membrane and the SERCA are most important for Ca(2+) homeostasis, inhibition of PMCA in epithelial cells has a greater effect than in stromal cells. Furthermore, the proportion of PMCA and SERCA differs in PC3 and DU145 cells. PMCA is most effective at reaching resting [Ca(2+) ]i in the final recovery stage. In contrast to DU 145 and P21 cells, PC3 are the only cells substantially affected by the inhibition of the mitochondrial uniporter. In all cell lines the role of the sodium calcium exchanger is marginal.  Conclusion:   These results demonstrate that not only cancer and stromal cell lines show significant differences in the modes and extent of their use of Ca(2+) clearance mechanisms, but also the cancer cell lines themselves.""","""['Anne Wolf', 'Gunther Wennemuth']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Interaction of ligand-receptor system between stromal-cell-derived factor-1 and CXC chemokine receptor 4 in human prostate cancer: a possible predictor of metastasis.', 'Role of hepatocyte growth factor in invasion of prostate cancer cell lines through tumor-stromal interaction.', 'Signal transducer and activator of transcription-6 (STAT6) is a constitutively expressed survival factor in human prostate cancer.', 'Adenosine induces cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis in androgen-dependent and -independent prostate cancer cell lines, LNcap-FGC-10, DU-145, and PC3.', 'Immortalized and tumorigenic adult human prostatic epithelial cell lines: characteristics and applications.

Methods:   A total of 667 consecutive patients that underwent prostate biopsy for detection of PCa at Huashan Hospital and Changhai Hospital, Shanghai, China were recruited. Genetic scores were calculated for each patient using various combinations of 29 PCa risk-associated SNPs. Performance of these genetic scores for discriminating prostate biopsy outcomes were compared using the area under a receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).  Results:   The discriminative performance of genetic score derived from a panel of all 29 SNPs (24 previous and 5 new) was similar to that derived from the 24 previously established SNPs, the AUC of which were 0.60 and 0.61, respectively (P = 0.72).

Although the biological activity of PSP94 is unclear, one of its hypothesized functions is to protect prostatic cells from pathogens. Number of sexual partners and a history of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) have been positively associated with PCa risk, and these associations may be related to pathogen-induced chronic prostatic inflammation. Based on these observations, we investigated whether MSMB genotype modifies the PCa-sexual history association.  Methods:   We estimated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between number of sexual partners and PCa by fitting logistic regression models, stratified by MSMB genotype, and adjusted for age, family history of PCa, and PCa screening history among 1,239 incident cases and 1,232 controls.  Results:   Compared with 1-4 female sexual partners, men with ≥ 15 such partners who carried the variant T allele of rs10993994 were at increased risk for PCa (OR = 1.32; 95% CI, 1.03-1.71); no association was observed in men with the CC genotype (OR = 1.03; 95% CI, 0.73-1.46; P = 0.05 for interaction).

However, the mechanism by which cancer cells downregulate TGFβ receptors in prostate is not clear. Here, we showed that coordinated action of miR-21 and androgen receptor (AR) signaling had a critical role in inhibiting TGFβ receptor II (TGFBR2) expression in prostate cancer cells. Our results revealed that miR-21 suppresses TGFBR2 levels by binding to its 3'-UTR and AR signaling further potentiates this effect in both untransformed and transformed human prostate epithelial cells as well as in human prostate cancers. Analysis of primary prostate cancers showed that increased miR-21/AR expression parallel a significantly reduced expression of TGFBR2. Manipulation of androgen signaling or the expression levels of AR or miR-21 negatively altered TGFBR2 expression in untransformed and transformed human prostate epithelial cells, human prostate cancer xenografts and mouse prostate glands. Importantly, we demonstrated that miR-21 and AR regulated each other's expression resulting in a positive feedback loop. Our results indicated that miR-21/AR mediate its tumor-promoting function by attenuating TGFβ-mediated Smad2/3 activation, cell growth inhibition, cell migration and apoptosis. Together, these results suggest that the AR and miR-21 axis exerts its oncogenic effects in prostate tumors by downregulating TGFBR2, hence inhibiting the tumor-suppressive activity of TGFβ pathway.

Recently, rectal NETs have been noted to exhibit immunohistochemical (IHC) positivity for Islet 1 and PAX8, which are generally considered markers for NETs of pancreatic origin. In this study, we sought to characterize the IHC staining profile of rectal NETs and determine whether there was any correlation between the histologic pattern of rectal NETs and their IHC profile. Fifty-six primary rectal NETs were histologically reviewed and stained with antibodies against Islet 1, PAX8, CDX2, chromogranin A, and synaptophysin. In a subset of 31 cases, immunoreactivity for serotonin, pancreatic polypeptide (PP), and prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP) was also studied. By morphology, the tumors studied included 55 % trabecular, 27 % solid nested, 4 % acinar, and 14 % mixed patterns. Islet 1 was positive in 89 % and PAX8 in 79 % of cases. CDX2 was negative in all 56 cases. Cytoplasmic staining was observed for chromogranin A in 30 % of cases and for synaptophysin in all 56 cases. Cytoplasmic staining for serotonin, PP, and PAP was present in 16, 61, and 97 % of cases, respectively. There was no correlation between histologic pattern and IHC staining pattern with any of the antibodies studied. We have demonstrated that Islet 1 and PAX8 are not entirely specific for NETs of pancreatic origin, as they are expressed in a majority of rectal NETs. Since rectal NETs may show an IHC staining profile which mirrors that of pancreatic NETs (Islet 1 and PAX8-positive, CDX2-negative), a metastatic rectal NET should be considered in the differential diagnosis and ruled out clinically in the work-up of a metastatic NET of unknown primary origin which exhibits this staining profile.""","""['Jamie Koo', 'Xiaoyan Zhou', 'Elizabeth Moschiano', 'Mariza De Peralta-Venturina', 'Richard B Mertens', 'Deepti Dhall']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Endocr Pathol""","""['Value of Islet 1 and PAX8 in identifying metastatic neuroendocrine tumors of pancreatic origin.', 'Positivity for SATB2 distinguishes Islet1 positive rectal neuroendocrine tumours from pancreaticoduodenal neuroendocrine tumours.', 'Value of SATB2, ISL1, and TTF1 to differentiate rectal from other gastrointestinal and lung well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors.', 'Unusual staining of immunohistochemical markers PAX8 and CDX2 in breast carcinoma: a potential diagnostic pitfall.', 'Selected markers (chromogranin A, neuron-specific enolase, synaptophysin, protein gene product 9.5) in diagnosis and prognosis of neuroendocrine pulmonary tumours.', 'Immunoreactivity of HOXB13 in Neuroendocrine Neoplasms Is a Sensitive and Specific Marker of Rectal Well-Differentiated Neuroendocrine Tumors.', 'Metastatic Neuroendocrine Neoplasms of Unknown Primary: Clues from Pathology Workup.', 'An analysis of 130 neuroendocrine tumors G3 regarding prevalence, origin, metastasis, and diagnostic features.', 'Pathology Reporting in Neuroendocrine Neoplasms of the Digestive System: Everything You Always Wanted to Know but Were Too Afraid to Ask.', 'Biomarkers for Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Neoplasms (PanNENs) Management-An Updated Review.']"""

Anthropometric measures of abdominal adiposity were measured from T2-weighted sagittal localisation images from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for 413 (56.3%) patients. Patient clinical and pathological characteristics were compared across body mass index (BMI) groups. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression models were used to address the influence of the preoperative total testosterone level and anthropometric measures of obesity on pathological outcomes. In the multivariate analysis, BMI was not significantly associated with any pathological outcomes. However, the percentage of visceral adipose tissue (VAT%) was an independent predictor of a pathological Gleason score ≥8 (P<0.001), extracapsular extension (ECE; P=0.002) and seminal vesicle invasion (SVI; P=0.007). More importantly, we found that the preoperative total testosterone level was significantly correlated with the VAT% (Pearson's correlation coefficient: -0.485, P<0.001) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT; Pearson's correlation coefficient: 0.413, P<0.001). In conclusion, the results of this study suggest that abdominal fat distribution, and particularly VAT%, is associated with a risk of advanced PCa.

The chi-squared test was used to compare survival rates between older and younger (n=197) patients. All patients were followed up.

Our aims were to assess the associations of a CRP genetic risk score (CRP-GRS) created from single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with colorectal cancer risk, as well as examine plasma CRP and CRP-GRS in relation to common cancers in the ARIC cohort.  Methods:   Cox proportional hazards models were used to prospectively estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) of total, colorectal, lung, prostate, and breast cancers in relation to: (1) CRP-GRS among 8,657 Whites followed in 1987-2006 and (2) log-transformed plasma CRP among 7,603 Whites followed in 1996-2006. A weighted CRP-GRS was comprised of 20 CRP-related SNPs located in/near CRP, APOC1, HNF1A, LEPR, and 16 other genes that were identified in genome-wide association studies.  Results:   After multivariable adjustment, one standard deviation increment of the CRP-GRS was associated with colorectal cancer risk (HR 1.19; 95 % CI 1.03-1.37), but not with any other cancer. One unit of log-transformed plasma CRP was associated with the risk of total, colorectal, lung, and breast cancers: HRs (95 % CIs) were 1.08 (1.01-1.15), 1.24 (1.01-1.51), 1.29 (1.08-1.54), and 1.27 (1.07-1.51), respectively. HRs remained elevated, although lost statistical significance for all but breast cancer, after excluding subjects with <2 years of follow-up.

The overall mean error of the registration-based correction of the planning target volume was comparable to the interobserver variability of manual target volume definition. The correction by affine image fusion was inferior to the results of elastic registration. The maximal deviation for the interobserver segmentation was 15.4 mm, 10.5 mm for the affine and 8.0 mm for the elastic registration.

Today, there are no objective criteria to determine whether an optimal treatment plan has been achieved, and physicians rely on their personal experience to evaluate the plan's quality. In this study, we propose a method for determining rectal and bladder dose constraints achievable for a given patient's anatomy. We expect that this method will improve the overall plan quality and consistency, and facilitate comparison of clinical outcomes across different institutions. The 3D proximity of the organs at risk to the target is quantified by means of the expansion-intersection volume (EIV), which is defined as the intersection volume between the target and the organ at risk expanded by 5 mm. We determine a relationship between EIV and relevant dosimetric parameters, such as the volume of bladder and rectum receiving 75% of the prescription dose (V75%). This relationship can be used to establish institution-specific criteria to guide the treatment planning and evaluation process. A database of 25 prostate patients treated with CyberKnife SBRT is used to validate this approach. There is a linear correlation between EIV and V75% of bladder and rectum, confirming that the dose delivered to rectum and bladder increases with increasing extension and proximity of these organs to the target. This information can be used during the planning stage to facilitate the plan optimization process, and to standardize plan quality and consistency. We have developed a method for determining customized dose constraints for prostate patients treated with robotic SBRT. Although the results are technology specific and based on the experience of a single institution, we expect that the application of this method by other institutions will result in improved standardization of clinical practice.""","""['Martina Descovich', 'Mauro Carrara', 'Sara Morlino', 'Dilini S Pinnaduwage', 'Daniel Saltiel', 'Jean Pouliot', 'Marc B Nash', 'Emanuele Pignoli', 'Riccardo Valdagni', 'Mack Roach rd', 'Alexander R Gottschalk']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Appl Clin Med Phys""","""['Interfraction Anatomical Variability Can Lead to Significantly Increased Rectal Dose for Patients Undergoing Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy for Prostate Cancer.', 'A knowledge-based approach to improving and homogenizing intensity modulated radiation therapy planning quality among treatment centers: an example application to prostate cancer planning.', 'Improved robotic stereotactic body radiation therapy plan quality and planning efficacy for organ-confined prostate cancer utilizing overlap-volume histogram-driven planning methodology.', 'Strict bladder filling and rectal emptying during prostate SBRT: Does it make a dosimetric or clinical difference?', 'Plan quality and dosimetric association of patient-reported rectal and urinary toxicities for prostate stereotactic body radiotherapy.', 'Largely reduced OAR doses, and planning and delivery times for challenging robotic SBRT cases, obtained with a novel optimizer.', 'A method of using deep learning to predict three-dimensional dose distributions for intensity-modulated radiotherapy of rectal cancer.', 'A new plan quality objective function for determining optimal collimator combinations in prostate cancer treatment with stereotactic body radiation therapy using CyberKnife.', 'SBRT planning for spinal metastasis: indications from a\xa0large multicentric study.', 'Clinical usefulness of MLCs in robotic radiosurgery systems for prostate SBRT.']"""

To monitor the positional reproducibility of patient breathing against a 4D CT simulation, we developed a real-time motion verification system (RMVS) using an optical tracking technology. The system in the treatment room was integrated with a real-time position management system. To test the system, an anthropomorphic phantom that was mounted on a motion platform moved on a programmed breathing pattern and then underwent a 4D CT simulation with RPM. The phase-resolved anterior surface lines were extracted from the 4D CT data to constitute 4D reference lines. In the treatment room, three infrared reflective markers were attached on the superior, middle, and inferior parts of the phantom along with the body midline and then RMVS could track those markers using an optical camera system. The real-time phase information extracted from RPM was delivered to RMVS via in-house network software. Thus, the real-time anterior-posterior positions of the markers were simultaneously compared with the 4D reference lines. The technical feasibility of RMVS was evaluated by repeating the above procedure under several scenarios such as ideal case (with identical motion parameters between simulation and treatment), cycle change, baseline shift, displacement change, and breathing type changes (abdominal or chest breathing). The system capability for operating under irregular breathing was also investigated using real patient data. The evaluation results showed that RMVS has a competence to detect phase-matching errors between patient's motion during the treatment and 4D CT simulation. Thus, we concluded that RMVS could be used as an online quality assurance tool for phase-based gating treatments.""","""['Yang-Kyun Park', 'Tae-geun Son', 'Hwiyoung Kim', 'Jaegi Lee', 'Wonmo Sung', 'Il Han Kim', 'Kunwoo Lee', 'Young-bong Bang', 'Sung-Joon Ye']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Appl Clin Med Phys""","""['SU-E-J-166: Development of Real-Time Motion Verification System for Respiratory-Gated Radiotherapy.', 'From phase-based to displacement-based gating: a software tool to facilitate respiration-gated radiation treatment.', 'Geometric validation of self-gating k-space-sorted 4D-MRI vs 4D-CT using a respiratory motion phantom.', 'Quantifying the impact of respiratory-gated 4D CT acquisition on thoracic image quality: a digital phantom study.', 'Simulation of dosimetry impact of 4DCT uncertainty in 4D dose calculation for lung SBRT.', 'Technical Note: Evaluation of audiovisual biofeedback smartphone application for respiratory monitoring in radiation oncology.', 'Dynamic gating window technique for the reduction of dosimetric error in respiratory-gated spot-scanning particle therapy: An initial phantom study using patient tumor trajectory data.', 'Visual and Quantitative Analysis Methods of Respiratory Patterns for Respiratory Gated PET/CT.', 'Development and clinical evaluation of a simple optical method to detect and measure patient external motion.', 'Combination effects of tissue heterogeneity and geometric targeting error in stereotactic body radiotherapy for lung cancer using CyberKnife.']"""

We report here a significant upregulation of SOX2 at both mRNA and protein levels in DU145 PCSCs propagated as suspension spheres in vitro. The expression of SOX2 in DU145 PCSCs is positively regulated by epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling. Activation of EGFR signaling, following the addition of epidermal growth factor (EGF) or ectopic expression of a constitutively-active EGFR mutant (EGFRvIII), increased SOX2 expression and the self-renewal of DU145 PCSCs. Conversely, a small molecule EGFR inhibitor (AG1478) blocked EGFR activation, reduced SOX2 expression and inhibited PCSC self-renewal activity, implicating SOX2 in mediating EGFR-dependent self-renewal of PCSCs. In line with this notion, ectopic SOX2 expression enhanced EGF-induced self-renewal of DU145 PCSCs, while SOX2 knockdown reduced PCSC self-renewal with EGF treatment no longer capable of enhancing their propagation. Furthermore, SOX2 knockdown reduced the capacity of DU145 PCSCs to grow under anchorage-independent conditions. Finally, DU145 PCSCs generated xenograft tumors more aggressively with elevated levels of SOX2 expression compared to xenograft tumors derived from non-PCSCs. Collectively, we provide evidence that SOX2 plays a critical role in EGFR-mediated self-renewal of DU145 PCSCs.""","""['Adrian P Rybak', 'Damu Tang']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Cell Signal""","""['Propagation of human prostate cancer stem-like cells occurs through EGFR-mediated ERK activation.', 'Characterization of sphere-propagating cells with stem-like properties from DU145 prostate cancer cells.', 'Prostate cancer stem-like cells proliferate slowly and resist etoposide-induced cytotoxicity via enhancing DNA damage response.', 'Biology and clinical applications of pancreatic cancer stem cells.', 'Prostate cancer stem cells: deciphering the origins and pathways involved in prostate tumorigenesis and aggression.', 'Signaling pathways and targeted therapies in lung squamous cell carcinoma: mechanisms and clinical trials.', 'Transcriptomic Signature and Growth Factor Regulation of Castration-Tolerant Prostate Luminal Progenitor Cells.', 'Cancer Stem Cell Markers for Urinary Carcinoma.', 'TMPRSS4 promotes cancer stem-like properties in prostate cancer cells through upregulation of SOX2 by SLUG and TWIST1.', 'The role of Trop2 in prostate cancer: an oncogene, biomarker, and therapeutic target.']"""

Few models of the normal and malignant human prostate that maintain stromal-epithelial interactions in vivo exist in which to study DNA damage responses. We evaluated the feasibility of maintaining tissue slice grafts at subcutaneous vs subrenal capsular sites in RAG2(-/-)γC(-/-) mice to study the DNA damage responses of normal and malignant glands.  Materials and methods:   We compared the take rate and histology of tissue slice grafts from fresh, precision cut surgical specimens that were maintained for 1 to 4 weeks in subcutaneous vs subrenal capsular sites. Induction of γH2AX, p53, ATM and apoptosis was evaluated as a measure of the DNA damage response after irradiation.  Results:   The take rate of subcutaneous tissue slice grafts was higher than typically reported but lower than at the subrenal capsular site. Subcutaneous tissue slice grafts frequently showed basal cell hyperplasia, squamous metaplasia and cystic atrophy, and cancer did not survive. In contrast, normal and malignant histology was well maintained in subrenal capsular tissue slice grafts. Regardless of implantation site the induction of γH2AX and ATM occurred in tissue slice graft epithelium 1 hour after irradiation and decreased to basal level by 24 hours, indicating DNA damage recognition and repair. As observed previously in prostatic ex vivo models, p53 was not activated. Notably, tumor but not normal cells responded to irradiation by undergoing apoptosis.  Conclusions:   To our knowledge this is the first study of DNA damage responses in a patient derived prostate tissue graft model.

Objective:   To examine the association of clinical and pathologic characteristics, as well as patterns of surveillance biopsy results, with the risk of progression in men on AS.  Design, setting, and participants:   The retrospective study consisted of men with PCa who were on AS in the prospectively maintained University of California, San Francisco, institutional database from 1996 to 2011. Strict criteria for AS were prostate-specific antigen (PSA) ≤10 ng/ml, clinical stage T1 or T2, biopsy Gleason grade 6, <33% positive cores, and <50% tumor in any single core. Men were then categorized based on results of their confirmatory surveillance biopsy.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Disease progression was defined as an increase in Gleason grade and/or biopsy volume beyond prespecified cut points. Serial biopsy patterns over the course of surveillance were stratified by confirmatory biopsy findings: negative, positive without progression, and positive with progression. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to evaluate predictors of progression during AS.  Results and limitations:   A total of 465 men met inclusion criteria (median follow-up: 51 mo). Of these men, 23% had negative confirmatory biopsies. Only 3% of the men (1 of 30) progressed by the fourth surveillance biopsy following a biopsy pattern of negative confirmatory and negative third biopsy findings. Negative confirmatory biopsy and lower PSA density (both p<0.01) were independently associated with decreased odds of biopsy progression at 3 yr. The main limitation of this study is its observational nature.  Conclusions:   The patterns of surveillance biopsy results yield additional important information in AS.

However, the association between PSMs and prostate cancer-specific mortality (CSM) is poorly defined.  Objective:   Analyze the association of PSMs with CSM, adjusting for fixed and time-dependent parameters.  Design, setting, and participants:   Fine and Gray competing risk regression analysis was used to model the clinical data and follow-up information of 11,521 patients treated by RP between 1987 and 2005. Two extended models were used that adjusted for the use of postoperative radiotherapy, which was handled as a time-dependent covariate. Postoperative radiotherapy was modeled as a single parameter and also as early and late therapy, based on the prostate-specific antigen level at the start of treatment (≤0.5 vs >0.5 ng/ml).  Intervention:   RP for clinically localized prostate cancer and selective use of secondary local and/or systemic therapy.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The outcome measure was prostate cancer-specific mortality.  Results and limitations:   The 15-yr CSM rates for patients with PSMs and negative surgical margins were 10% and 6%, respectively (p<0.001). No significant association between PSM and CSM was observed in the conventional model with fixed covariates (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.04; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.7-1.5; p=0.8) or in the two extended models that adjusted for postoperative radiotherapy (HR: 0.96; 95% CI, 0.7-1.4; p=0.9), or early and late postoperative radiotherapy (HR: 1.01; 95% CI, 0.7-1.4; p=0.9).  Conclusions:   PSMs alone are not associated with a significantly increased risk of CSM within 15 yr of RP.

Methods and materials:   Thirty-nine patients, 35 men and 4 women with a mean age of 71 (range, 35-84) years were included after informed consent and institutional ethics approval. They had all been treated with radiation therapy for prostate (n=34), cervix (n=2), or rectal (n=3) cancer using external beam radiation at a dose of 25 to 75 Gy. Patients with hematuria requiring blood transfusion were excluded. The HBOT was delivered with 100% oxygen for 90 minutes at 2.0 to 2.4 atmospheres (ATA). Mean number of treatments was 36 (28-40). Symptoms were prospectively assessed using the Expanded Prostate Index Composite score before, during, and 6 to 12 months after HBOT.  Results:   The HBOT was successfully conducted, and symptoms were alleviated in 76% for patients with radiation cystitis, 89% for patients with radiation proctitis, and 88% of patients with combined cystitis and proctitis. Symptom reduction was demonstrated by an increased Expanded Prostate Index Composite score in the urinary domain from 50±16 to 66±20 after treatment (P<.001) and in the bowel domain from 48±18 to 68±18 after treatment (P<.001). For 31% of the patients with cystitis and 22% with proctitis, there were only trivial symptoms after HBOT. The improvement was sustained at follow-up in both domains 6 to 12 months after HBOT. No severe side effects were observed related to HBOT, and treatment compliance was high.

Methods and materials:   Gene expression profiles of volume-matched androgen-exposed and androgen-deprived CWR22 xenografts, with similar pimonidazole-positive fractions, were compared. Direct targets of androgen receptor (AR) and HIF1 transcription factors were identified among the differentially expressed genes by using published lists. Biological processes affected by ADT were determined by gene ontology analysis. HIF1α protein expression in xenografts and biopsy samples from 35 patients receiving neoadjuvant ADT was assessed by immunohistochemistry.  Results:   A total of 1344 genes showed more than 2-fold change in expression by ADT, including 35 downregulated and 5 upregulated HIF1 targets. Six genes were shared HIF1 and AR targets, and their downregulation was confirmed with quantitative RT-PCR. Significant suppression of the biological processes proliferation, metabolism, and stress response in androgen-deprived xenografts was found, consistent with tumor regression. Nineteen downregulated HIF1 targets were involved in those significant biological processes, most of them in metabolism. Four of these were shared AR and HIF1 targets, including genes encoding the regulatory glycolytic proteins HK2, PFKFB3, and SLC2A1. Most of the downregulated HIF1 targets were induced by hypoxia in androgen-responsive prostate cancer cell lines, confirming their role as hypoxia-responsive HIF1 targets in prostate cancer. Downregulation of HIF1 targets was consistent with the absence of HIF1α protein in xenografts and downregulation in patients by ADT (P<.001).  Conclusions:   AR repression by ADT may lead to downregulation of HIF1 signaling independently of hypoxic fraction, and this may contribute to tumor regression.

Methods:   Tissue microarrays were constructed from 42 consecutive radical prostatectomy specimens with minute prostatic adenocarcinoma. Standard immunohistochemistry analysis for mTOR pathway members PTEN, phos-S6, phos-4E-BP1, phos-mTOR, phos-AKT, p27, and ERG was performed. For all markers, histologic expression score was calculated as the sum of intensity × extent of expression. In addition, for PTEN, presence of ""markedly decreased"" expression (any focal absence of expression) was also assessed. Expression status of all biomarkers was compared between tumor and paired benign tissue. Intercorrelation among markers was also performed.  Results:   PTEN expression was seen in all 36 evaluable minute prostatic adenocarcinoma.

Materials and methods:   Semiautomatic MR compatible biopsy needles with a diameter of 16 G (Group A) or 18 G (Group B) were used to perform MRGB in 88 patients with suspected prostate cancer. After embedding and staining, length and width of all specimens (140 cores in Group A, 143 in Group B) were measured. Fragmentation, squeezing artifacts, and overall evaluability were evaluated using a quality score from 0 (no tissue) to 3 (optimal tissue quality). Groups were statistically compared; p-values <0.05 were regarded as significant.  Results:   Demographic data were not significantly different between Group A and B with a mean age of 63 ± 7.3 and 67 ± 5.7 years; and a mean prostate-specific antigen of 12.6 ± 10.3 ng/ml and 13.8 ± 11.6 ng/ml, respectively (p=0.70).

However, there were significantly more cores without prostate tissue with 18 cores (12.9%) versus 3 cores (2.1%) in Groups A and B, respectively (p=0.004). Fragmentation, squeezing artifacts, and overall evaluability were not statistically different between the two groups. The rate of prostate cancer in the cores was also not significantly different between Groups A and B (22.1% and 24.5%; p=0.77).  Conclusion:   16 G biopsy needles do not provide a relevant diagnostic advantage over 18 G needles in MRGB.

The standard treatments validated by the French Association of Urology are the radical prostatectomy and the external beam radiotherapy.  Objectives:   We retrospectively compared the carcinologic results of the radical prostatectomy±adjuvant treatment (RP) and the external beam radiotherapy combining high dose (75.6 Gy) and short hormonotherapy (RH), in the treatment of intermediate risk prostate cancer. The series consisted of 143 patients treated between 2000 and 2006 in the department of Urology and Kidney transplantation of the Conception Hospital, Marseilles. The main assessment criteria was the survival without biological recurrence (SBR).  Results:   The median follow-up was 90 months [59-51]. The 5 years and 8 years SBR were 85% and 73% in the RH group, versus 74% and 65% with RP (P=0.196). There was a significant difference between the series: on the age of diagnosis (63.9 versus 73.3 years, P<0.001), the Charlson score of comorbidity (2 versus 3, P<0.001) and the number of intermediate criteria per patients (one intermediate criteria: RP 74% versus 57%, P<0.01).  Conclusion:   According to our study, there was no superiority of the radical prostatectomy±adjuvant treatment or the external radiotherapy combining high dose and concomitant short hormonotherapy on the survival without biological recurrence at 5 and 8 years.

The objective of this study was to test a hypothesis that insulin and IGF1 enhance IL-17-induced expression of inflammatory chemokines/cytokines through a glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3B)-dependent mechanism, which can be inhibited by melatonin. We found that insulin/IGF1 and lithium chloride enhanced IL-17-induced expression of C-X-C motif ligand 1 (Cxcl1) and C-C motif ligand 20 (Ccl20) in the Gsk3b(+/+) , but not in Gsk3b(-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells. IL-17 induced higher levels of Cxcl1 and Ccl20 in the Gsk3b(-/-) MEF cells, compared with the Gsk3b(+/+) MEF cells. Insulin and IGF1 activated Akt to phosphorylate GSK3B at serine 9, thus inhibiting GSK3B activity. Melatonin inhibited Akt activation, thus decreasing P-GSK3B at serine 9 (i.e., increasing GSK3B activity) and subsequently inhibiting expression of Cxcl1 and Ccl20 that was induced either by IL-17 alone or by a combination of insulin and IL-17. Melatonin's inhibitory effects were only observed in the Gsk3b(+/+) , but in not Gsk3b(-/-) MEF cells. Melatonin also inhibited expression of Cxcl1, Ccl20, and Il-6 that was induced by a combination of insulin and IL-17 in the mouse prostatic tissues. Further, nighttime human blood, which contained high physiologic levels of melatonin, decreased expression of Cxcl1, Ccl20, and Il-6 in the PC3 human prostate cancer xenograft tumors.

Methods:   We evaluated how recommending the inclusion of walnuts (75 g day(-1) ) in the diet affected energy and nutrient intake in men (45-75 years; mean body mass index = 27.6 kg m(-2) ; n = 19) at risk for developing prostate cancer. Guidance was provided about incorporating walnuts isocalorically in a healthy diet. Three-day food records and body weight were collected at baseline and after two 8-week diet periods (usual versus walnut supplement diets).  Results:   Energy intake on the walnut supplement diet exceeded the usual diet, although body weight was maintained. Energy intake was lower on the actual walnut supplement diet than the calculated walnut diet [10,865 kJ (2595 kcal) versus 11,325 kJ (2705 kcal) per day, respectively] and contributed 23% less energy than 75 g of walnuts. Approximately, 86% and 85% of the total fat and saturated fatty acids from walnuts were not displaced, whereas the increase in fibre from the usual diet to the actual walnut supplement diet represented less than one-half (39%) of the fibre provided by 75 g of walnuts. Walnuts were substituted, in part, for other foods, and the nutrient profile of the diet was improved, however, the beneficial effect of walnuts on the diet quality was not optimized.

However, the relationship between CXCL14 and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unclear. Therefore, the exact function of CXCL14, which may modulate antitumor immune responses in certain cancers, was evaluated. CXCL14 was downregulated in HCC tissues compared to adjacent normal tissues. Moreover, overexpression of CXCL14 had an inhibitory effect on cell proliferation, induced apoptosis and inhibited the invasion of HCC cells in vitro. Upregulation of CXCL14 by lentivirus also significantly suppressed the growth of subcutaneous tumors in nude mice in vivo. We further demonstrated that the loss of CXCL14 expression was regulated by promoter hypermethylation. CXCL14 induced tumor cell apoptosis through both the mitochondrial and nuclear apoptosis pathways.

Methods:   Patients included in the intermediate-risk group were those presenting clinical stage T1c to T2c (by magnetic resonance imaging staging), Gleason score 3 + 4 or lower and/or prostate-specific antigen less than 20 ng/mL, whereas those with clinical stage T1c to T2a, Gleason score 3 + 3 and prostate-specific antigen less than 10 ng/mL represented the low-risk group, and were used as controls. In the intermediate-risk group, therapy with a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analog was continued for at least 6 months before and after permanent brachytherapy.  Results:   A total of 147 low-risk group patients and 139 intermediate-risk group patients were included in the study. The median follow up was 51 and 52 months for the intermediate-risk group and low-risk group, respectively. The 5-year overall, cause-specific and distant-metastasis-free survival rates in the low-risk group and intermediate-risk group were 97.6/99.2, 100/100 and 100/100%, respectively.

A sizable body of reports has presented evidences to indicate the involvement of PRL in the pathogenic process of cancers of the reproductive system, such as prostate and breast cancers. PRL exerts its effects by dimerizing its receptor (PRLR) on the plasma membrane, and initiating cellular Jak-Stat signal pathway. We have previously cloned from prostate cancer cells a natural variant of PRLR in which the S2 subdomain of the extracellular domain is missing (ΔS2). Our preliminary data showed that ΔS2 PRLR was able to dimerize and to constitutively activate the β-casein promoter (in the absence of its ligand, PRL) in breast and prostate epithelial cells. Enhancer of zeste homologue 2 (EZH2), an important histone-modifying enzyme, is able to trimethylate histone 3 on lysine 27 (H3K27Me3), consequently leading to gene silencing, especially silencing of tumor suppressor genes such as p53. We hypothesized that ΔS2 PRLR played an important pathogenic role in prostate cancer through, at least partly, alterations in the expression of EZH2 and the trimethylation of histone 3 on lysine 27. In the present study, overexpression of ΔS2 PRLR in prostate epithelial cells was achieved by infection with an adenoviral vector carrying the cDNA. The viable cell number overexpressing ΔS2 PRLR was assessed using MTS reagent. Western blot, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay and acid histone extraction were applied to detect expression of EZH2 as well as trimethylation of histone 3, respectively. In prostate epithelial cells, overexpression of ΔS2 PRLR increased the levels of EZH2 methyltransferase mRNA and protein, induced EZH2 methyltransferase recruitment to chromatin, increased the trimethylation of histone 3 on lysine 27, and decreased expression of the p53 gene. We concluded that ΔS2 PRLR plays an important pathogenic role in prostate cancer through epigenetic covalent modification leading to chromatin remodeling. Hypertrimethylation on H3K27 of the p53 gene promoter region due to elevated expression of ΔS2 PRLR by alternative splicing of the pre-mRNA in its full-length form might serve as a new mechanism underlying human prostate cancer.""","""['Dunyong Tan', 'Si Tan', 'Jie Zhang', 'Peizhi Tang', 'Jianjun Huang', 'Weihua Zhou', 'Shijun Wu']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Chin J Physiol""","""['Expression of a constitutively active prolactin receptor causes histone trimethylation of the p53 gene in breast cancer.', 'Histone 3 Trimethylation of IGFBP-7 Gene Promoter by Expression of D5 Stat5a in Breast Epithelial Cells.', 'The association between histone 3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) and prostate cancer: relationship with clinicopathological parameters.', 'Multifaceted role of EZH2 in breast and prostate tumorigenesis: epigenetics and beyond.', 'Mutations and deletions of PRC2 in prostate cancer.', 'Tumor- and metastasis-promoting roles of miR-488 inhibition via HULC enhancement and EZH2-mediated p53 repression in gastric cancer.', 'Functional regulations between genetic alteration-driven genes and drug target genes acting as prognostic biomarkers in breast cancer.', 'Prolactin Receptor Signaling Regulates a Pregnancy-Specific Transcriptional Program in Mouse Islets.', 'Effects of histone methyltransferase inhibition in endometriosis.', 'The Cytokinome Profile in Patients with Hepatocellular Carcinoma and Type 2 Diabetes.']"""

Material and methods:   A total of 171 prostate cancer patients recurring after RP undergoing erMRI before SRT were analyzed. A median dose of 64 Gy was delivered to the prostatic bed (PB) with, in addition, a boost of 10 Gy to the suspected relapse as visualized on erMRI in 131 patients (76.6%).

LAT1 and LAT3 are overexpressed at different stages of prostate cancer, and they are responsible for increasing nutrients and stimulating cell growth.  Methods:   We examined LAT3 protein expression in human prostate cancer tissue microarrays. LAT function was inhibited using a leucine analog (BCH) in androgen-dependent and -independent environments, with gene expression analyzed by microarray. A PC-3 xenograft mouse model was used to study the effects of inhibiting LAT1 and LAT3 expression. Results were analyzed with the Mann-Whitney U or Fisher exact tests. All statistical tests were two-sided.  Results:   LAT3 protein was expressed at all stages of prostate cancer, with a statistically significant decrease in expression after 4-7 months of neoadjuvant hormone therapy (4-7 month mean = 1.571; 95% confidence interval = 1.155 to 1.987 vs 0 month = 2.098; 95% confidence interval = 1.962 to 2.235; P = .0187). Inhibition of LAT function led to activating transcription factor 4-mediated upregulation of amino acid transporters including ASCT1, ASCT2, and 4F2hc, all of which were also regulated via the androgen receptor. LAT inhibition suppressed M-phase cell cycle genes regulated by E2F family transcription factors including critical castration-resistant prostate cancer regulatory genes UBE2C, CDC20, and CDK1. In silico analysis of BCH-downregulated genes showed that 90.9% are statistically significantly upregulated in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. Finally, LAT1 or LAT3 knockdown in xenografts inhibited tumor growth, cell cycle progression, and spontaneous metastasis in vivo.

Dietary intake of nutrients is considered crucial for preventing the initiation of events leading to the development of carcinoma. Many dietary compounds have been considered to contribute to cancer prevention including zinc, which has a pivotal role in modulating apoptosis. However, the mechanism for zinc-mediated prostate cancer chemoprevention remains enigmatic. In this study, we investigated the therapeutic effect of zinc in prostate cancer chemoprevention for the first time. Exposure to zinc induced apoptosis and resulted in transactivation of p21(WAF1/Cip1) in a Smad-dependent and p53-independent manner in prostate cancer cells. Smad2 and PIAS1 proteins were significantly upregulated resulting in dramatically increased interactions between Smad2/4 and PIAS1 in the presence of zinc in LNCaP cells. Furthermore, it was found that the zinc-induced Smad4/2/PIAS1 transcriptional complex is responsible for Smad4 binding to SBE1 and SBE3 regions within the p21(WAF1/Cip1) promoter. Exogenous expression of Smad2/4 and PIAS1 promotes zinc-induced apoptosis concomitant with Smad4 nuclear translocation, whereas endogenous Smad2/4 silencing inhibited zinc-induced apoptosis accompanying apparent p21(WAF1/Cip1) reduction. Moreover, the knockdown of PIAS1 expression attenuated the zinc-induced recruitment of Smad4 on the p21(WAF1/Cip1) promoter. The colony formation experiments demonstrate that PIAS1 and Smad2/4 silencing could attenuate zinc apoptotic effects, with a proliferation of promoting effects. We further demonstrate the correlation of apoptotic sensitivity to zinc and Smad4 and PIAS1 in multiple cancer cell lines, demonstrating that the important roles of PIAS1, Smad2, and Smad4 in zinc-induced cell death and p21(WAF1/Cip1) transactivation were common biological events in different cancer cell lines. Our results suggest a new avenue for regulation of zinc-induced apoptosis, and provide a model that demonstrates zinc endorses the Smad2/4/PIAS1 complex to activate the p21(WAF1/Cip1) gene that mediates apoptosis.""","""['N Yang', 'B Zhao', 'A Rasul', 'H Qin', 'J Li', 'X Li']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Cell Death Dis""","""['PIAS1 is increased in human prostate cancer and enhances proliferation through inhibition of p21.', 'Transcriptional inhibition of p21WAF1/CIP1 gene (CDKN1) expression by survivin is at least partially p53-dependent: evidence for survivin acting as a transcription factor or co-factor.', 'Role of Smad proteins and transcription factor Sp1 in p21(Waf1/Cip1) regulation by transforming growth factor-beta.', 'p21Waf1/Cip1: its paradoxical effect in the regulation of breast cancer.', 'Differential effects of cell cycle regulatory protein p21(WAF1/Cip1) on apoptosis and sensitivity to cancer chemotherapy.', 'Post-Translational Modifications in Atopic Dermatitis: Current Research and Clinical Relevance.', 'The E3 Ligase PIAS1 Regulates p53 Sumoylation to Control Stress-Induced Apoptosis of Lens Epithelial Cells Through the Proapoptotic Regulator Bax.', 'Functional genomics study of protein inhibitor of activated STAT1 in mouse hippocampal neuronal cells revealed by RNA sequencing.', 'Advances of Zinc Signaling Studies in Prostate Cancer.', 'Dexamethasone induced apoptosis of A549 cells via the TGF-β1/Smad2 pathway.']"""

Methods:   The effect of EL102 and/or docetaxel on PC-3, DU145, 22Rv1 and CWR22 prostate cancer cells was assessed using cell viability, cell cycle analysis and PARP cleavage assays. Tubulin polymerisation and immunofluorescence assays were used to assess tubulin dynamics. CWR22 xenograft murine model was used to assess effects on tumour proliferation.

Methods:   Patients treated with postprostatectomy radiation therapy with pT3 tumors, or pT2 with positive surgical margins, were identified. Cumulative freedom from biochemical failure (FFBF), freedom from metastatic failure (FFMF), and overall survival rates were estimated utilizing the Kaplan-Meier method. Multivariate analyses were performed to determine independent prognostic factors correlated with study endpoints. Propensity score analyses were performed to adjust for confounding because of nonrandom treatment allocation.  Results:   A total of 186 patients with adverse pathologic features treated with ART or SRT were identified. The median follow-up time after radical prostatectomy was 103 and 88 months after completion of radiation therapy. The Kaplan-Meier estimates for 10-year FFBF was 73% and 41% after ART and SRT, respectively (log-rank, P=0.0001). Ten-year FFMF was higher for patients who received ART versus SRT (98.6% vs. 80.9%, P=0.0028). On multivariate analyses there was no significant difference with respect to treatment group in terms of FFBF, FFMF, and overall survival after adjusting for propensity score.  Conclusions:   Although unadjusted analyses showed improved FFBF with ART, the propensity score-adjusted analyses demonstrated that long-term outcomes of patients treated with ART and SRT do not differ significantly.

We previously found an association between 3 months of comprehensive lifestyle changes and increased telomerase activity in human immune-system cells. We followed up participants to investigate long-term effects.  Methods:   This follow-up study compared ten men and 25 external controls who had biopsy-proven low-risk prostate cancer and had chosen to undergo active surveillance. Eligible participants were enrolled between 2003 and 2007 from previous studies and selected according to the same criteria. Men in the intervention group followed a programme of comprehensive lifestyle changes (diet, activity, stress management, and social support), and the men in the control group underwent active surveillance alone. We took blood samples at 5 years and compared relative telomere length and telomerase enzymatic activity per viable cell with those at baseline, and assessed their relation to the degree of lifestyle changes.  Findings:   Relative telomere length increased from baseline by a median of 0·06 telomere to single-copy gene ratio (T/S)units (IQR-0·05 to 0·11) in the lifestyle intervention group, but decreased in the control group (-0·03 T/S units, -0·05 to 0·03, difference p=0·03). When data from the two groups were combined, adherence to lifestyle changes was significantly associated with relative telomere length after adjustment for age and the length of follow-up (for each percentage point increase in lifestyle adherence score, T/S units increased by 0·07, 95% CI 0·02-0·12, p=0·005). At 5 years, telomerase activity had decreased from baseline by 0·25 (-2·25 to 2·23) units in the lifestyle intervention group, and by 1·08 (-3·25 to 1·86) units in the control group (p=0·64), and was not associated with adherence to lifestyle changes (relative risk 0·93, 95% CI 0·72-1·20, p=0·57).  Interpretation:   Our comprehensive lifestyle intervention was associated with increases in relative telomere length after 5 years of follow-up, compared with controls, in this small pilot study. Larger randomised controlled trials are warranted to confirm this finding.

Climacturia (leakage of urine during orgasm) has been reported after prostatectomy but studies have been limited by multiple factors. In this study we examine the prevalence, causes and impact on orgasm function of climacturia after definitive treatment of prostate cancer with surgery or radiation.  Materials and methods:   A total of 906 anonymous surveys were sent to patients with prostate cancer treated with surgery and/or radiation. Respondents were asked about the presence of urinary leakage, climacturia and various elements related to sexual and orgasmic function. We estimated the prevalence of climacturia, evaluated the differences between those with and without climacturia, and assessed the impact of climacturia on orgasmic function.  Results:   Overall 412 surveys were returned and available for analysis, and of these respondents 75.2% were sexually active or experiencing orgasms. Climacturia was reported by 22.6% of these respondents, and by 28.3%, 5.2% and 28.6% of those treated with surgery, radiation, or both, respectively (p <0.001). The use of aides to obtain an erection (OR 2.24, 95% CI 1.08-4.93, p = 0.035) and the presence of urinary incontinence (OR 3.09, 95% CI 1.66-5.88, p <0.001) were also associated with climacturia in a multivariate logistic regression model. Climacturia had no significant impact on orgasmic function and satisfaction.  Conclusions:   Climacturia is experienced by a substantial proportion of men after undergoing definitive treatment of prostate cancer. We found a complex relationship between stress urinary incontinence and climacturia, and noted that the presence of climacturia does not necessarily negatively impact sexual satisfaction.""","""[""Brock B O'Neil"", 'Angela Presson', 'John Gannon', 'Robert A Stephenson', 'William Lowrance', 'Christopher B Dechet', 'Jonathan D Tward', 'Jeremy B Myers', 'William O Brant']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Bother Associated With Climacturia After Radical Prostatectomy: Prevalence and Predictors.', 'Climacturia following radical prostatectomy: prevalence and risk factors.', 'Prevalence and Predictors of Climacturia and Associated Patient/Partner Bother in Patients With History of Definitive Therapy for Prostate Cancer.', 'Orgasmic Dysfunction Following Radical Prostatectomy: Review of Current Literature.', 'Management of Climacturia During Inflatable Penile Prosthesis Surgery.', 'Sexual health and treatment-related sexual dysfunction in sexual and gender minorities with prostate cancer.', 'Climacturia: what treatment options do we offer to those with and without concomitant erectile dysfunction?', 'Mapping the prevalence and use of questionnaires to detect the neglected sexual side effects after prostate cancer treatment: a scoping review.', 'Radical Prostatectomy: Sequelae in the Course of Time.', 'Focusing on sexual rehabilitation besides penile rehabilitation following radical prostatectomy is important.']"""

We evaluated the utilization of BT, EBRT, and combination BT+EBRT by the year of diagnosis and performed a multivariable analysis to determine the predictors of BT as treatment choice.  Results:   Between 2004 and 2009, EBRT monotherapy use increased from 55.8% to 62.0%, whereas all BT use correspondingly decreased from 44.2% to 38.0% (BT-only use decreased from 30.4% to 25.6%, whereas BT+EBRT use decreased from 13.8% to 12.3%).

Multivariable analysis found that age, race, marital status, SEER registry, median county income, and National Comprehensive Cancer Network risk category were independent predictors of BT as treatment choice (all p<0.001). Moreover, after controlling for all available patient and tumor characteristics, there was decreasing utilization of BT with increasing year of diagnosis (odds ratio for BT=0.920, 95% confidence interval: 0.911-0.929, p<0.001).

The resulting fusion proteins can efficiently self-assemble into a well-defined parallel homotrimer with high stability. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis of the trimeric targeting ligands demonstrated significantly enhanced target-binding strength compared with the corresponding monomers. Cellular-binding studies confirmed that the trimeric targeting ligands have superior binding strength toward their respective receptors. Significantly, the EGFR-binding tribody was considerably accumulated in the tumor of mice bearing xenografted EGFR-positive tumors, indicating its effective cancer-targeting feature under in vivo conditions.

The biological functions of caveolin-1 in cancer are compound, multifaceted, and depend on cell type, tumour grade and cancer stage. The AT1-R-caveolin complex in caveolae may coordinate angiotensin II (Ang II) induced signalling. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of the angiotensin II receptor type 1 blocker candesartan on caveolin expression in human metastatic prostate adenocarcinoma cells PC-3.  Material and methods:   WST-1 and BrdU assays were used as indicators of cell viability and proliferation after angiotensin II and/or candesartan stimulation. Real-time RT-PCR and western blot were used to study the effect of Ang II and/or candesartan on the expression of Cav-1 and AT1-R in PC-3 cells.  Results:   We found that the expression of caveolin-1 mRNA in the PC-3 cells treated with CV was significantly decreased in comparison with the control (2.9 ±0.17, 4.7 ±0.6, p < 0.05), whereas a higher caveolin-1 mRNA expression was observed in those after Ang II treatment (6.0 ±0.43, 4.7 ±0.6, p < 0.05). Protein analysis indicate that the expression of caveolin-1 protein in the PC-3 cells treated with candesartan was significantly decreased when compared with the control (0.69 ±0.05, 1.6 ±0.12, p < 0.05), whereas higher caveolin-1 protein expression was observed after Ang II treatment (2.5 ±0.20, 1.6 ±0.12, p < 0.05).

Using BMI <22.5 as a reference, we observed inverse associations between BMI 22.5 to <25 at age 20 and all prostate cancer subtypes (ORs in the range 0.72-0.82), and between mean adult BMI 25 to <27.5 and low-intermediate-risk disease (OR 0.75, 95 % CI 0.55-1.02). Moderate adult weight gain increased the risk of disease in men with low BMI at start and in short men.  Conclusions:   Our comprehensive life-course approach revealed no convincing associations between anthropometric measures and prostate cancer risk. However, we found some leads that deserve further investigation, particularly for early-life body size.

Materials and methods:   This study included 389 patients who underwent RARP at a single institution with a follow-up period of at least 1 year. Preoperative findings were compared with biochemical recurrence (BCR). Predictors of BCR-free survival (BCRFS) were evaluated by univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard model analyses, and a risk stratification model based on the relative risks of BCR was established.  Results:   Fifty incidences of BCR were noted during a median follow-up period of 28.7 months (range, 12.1-80.0 months). The BCRFS rate for the entire cohort at the median follow-up time was 85.9 %; the 1-, 3-, and 5-year estimates were 91.0, 85.1, and 81.1 %, respectively. From univariate analyses, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), PSA density, biopsy Gleason score, and percent positive core were significantly associated with BCR. Multivariate analysis showed that PSA [hazard ratio (HR), 2.75; p = 0.001], percent positive core (HR, 2.22; p = 0.001), and biopsy Gleason score (HR, 2.61; p = 0.007) were independent predictors of BCR.  Conclusion:   This study at a single Japanese center demonstrates that RARP provides a satisfactory BCRFS rate. This report provides a framework with which to estimate oncological outcomes in patients who underwent RARP for localized prostate cancer. Our results support the increased use of RARP for the treatment of localized prostate cancer in Japan.""","""['Takeshi Hashimoto', 'Kunihiko Yoshioka', 'Tatsuo Gondo', 'Choichiro Ozu', 'Yutaka Horiguchi', 'Kazunori Namiki', 'Yoshio Ohno', 'Makoto Ohori', 'Jun Nakashima', 'Masaaki Tachibana']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Int J Clin Oncol""","""['Predictive factors and oncological outcomes of persistently elevated prostate-specific antigen in patients following robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Oncologic Outcomes After Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy: A Large European Single-centre Cohort with Median 10-Year Follow-up.', 'Oncologic outcomes at 10 years following robotic radical prostatectomy.', 'Long-term cancer control outcomes of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer treatment: a meta-analysis.', 'Systematic review and meta-analysis of studies reporting oncologic outcome after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Robot-assisted radical prostatectomy has lower biochemical recurrence than laparoscopic radical prostatectomy: Systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Robotic Prostatectomy Has a Superior Outcome in Larger Prostates and PSA Density Is a Strong Predictor of Biochemical Recurrence.']"""

We have therefore studied the effect of terfenadine (an H1-histamine receptor antagonist) in prostate cancer cell lines. Our data demonstrate that terfenadine was effective against PC-3 and DU-145 cells (two prostate cancer cell lines). In contrast, based on the sulforhodamine B assay, loratadine had less potency while fexofenadine and diphenhydramine had little effect. Terfenadine induced the cleavage of Mcl-1 cleavage into a pro-apoptotic 28-kDa fragment and up-regulation of Bak, resulting in the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) and the release of cytochrome c and apoptosis-inducing factor into the cytosol. The activation of caspase cascades was detected to be linked to terfenadine action. Bak up-regulation was also examined at both the transcriptional and translational levels, and Bak activation was validated based on conformational change to expose the N terminus. Terfenadine also induced an indirect-but not direct-DNA damage response through the cleavage and activation of caspase-2, phosphorylation and activation of Chk1 and Chk2 kinases, phosphorylation of RPA32 and acetylation of Histone H3; these processes were highly correlated to severe mitochondrial dysfunction and the activation of caspase cascades. In conclusion, terfenadine induced apoptotic signaling cascades against HRPCs in a sequential manner. The exposure of cells to terfenadine caused the up-regulation and activation of Bak and the cleavage of Mcl-1, leading to the loss of ΔΨm and activation of caspase cascades which further resulted in DNA damage response and cell apoptosis.""","""['Wei-Ting Wang', 'Yen-Hui Chen', 'Jui-Ling Hsu', 'Wohn-Jenn Leu', 'Chia-Chun Yu', 'She-Hung Chan', 'Yunn-Fang Ho', 'Lih-Ching Hsu', 'Jih-Hwa Guh']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch Pharmacol""","""['H1-receptor antagonists terfenadine and loratadine inhibit spontaneous growth of neoplastic mast cells.', 'Farnesyltransferase inhibitor BMS-214662 induces apoptosis in myeloma cells through PUMA up-regulation, Bax and Bak activation, and Mcl-1 elimination.', 'Terfenadine-induced apoptosis in human melanoma cells is mediated through Ca2+ homeostasis modulation and tyrosine kinase activity, independently of H1 histamine receptors.', 'Erlotinib induces mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis in human H3255 non-small-cell lung cancer cells with epidermal growth factor receptorL858R mutation through mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation-dependent activation of BAX and BAK.', 'Histamine and histamine receptor antagonists in cancer biology.', 'N-Heterocyclic Carbenes and Their Metal Complexes Based on Histidine and Histamine Derivatives of Bacteriopurpurinimide for the Combined Chemo- and Photodynamic Therapy of Cancer.', 'The Multidirectional Effect of Azelastine Hydrochloride on Cervical Cancer Cells.', 'Identification of hub genes associated with COVID-19 and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis by integrated bioinformatics analysis.', 'Huanglianjiedu Decoction as an effective treatment for oral squamous cell carcinoma based on network pharmacology and experimental validation.', 'Pathophysiological Roles of Histamine Receptors in Cancer Progression: Implications and Perspectives as Potential Molecular Targets.']"""

An oncogenic function of cell surface GRP78 has been attributed to the activation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway. We intend to use a novel anti-GRP78 monoclonal antibody (MAb159) to attenuate PI3K signaling and inhibit tumor growth and metastasis.  Experimental design:   MAb159 was characterized biochemically. Antitumor activity was tested in cancer cell culture, tumor xenograft models, tumor metastasis models, and spontaneous tumor models. Cancer cells and tumor tissues were analyzed for PI3K activity. MAb159 was humanized and validated for diagnostic and therapeutic application.  Results:   MAb159 specifically recognized surface GRP78, triggered GRP78 endocytosis, and localized to tumors but not to normal organs in vivo. MAb159 inhibited tumor cell proliferation and enhanced tumor cell death both in vitro and in vivo. In MAb159-treated tumors, PI3K signaling was inhibited without compensatory MAPK pathway activation. Furthermore, MAb159 halted or reversed tumor progression in the spontaneous PTEN-loss-driven prostate and leukemia tumor models, and inhibited tumor growth and metastasis in xenograft models. Humanized MAb159, which retains high affinity, tumor specific localization, and the antitumor activity, was nontoxic in mice, and had desirable pharmacokinetics.

We recently designed a set-up to exploit the destructive nature of hydrodynamic cavitation for biomedical purposes. We have previously shown that hydrodynamic cavitation could kill leukemia cells and erode kidney stones. In this study, we analyzed the effects of cavitation on prostate cells and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) tissue. We showed that hydrodynamic cavitation could kill prostate cells in a pressure- and time-dependent manner. Cavitation did not lead to programmed cell death, i.e. classical apoptosis or autophagy activation. Following the application of cavitation, we observed no prominent DNA damage and cells did not arrest in the cell cycle. Hence, we concluded that cavitation forces directly damaged the cells, leading to their pulverization. Upon application to BPH tissues from patients, cavitation could lead to a significant level of tissue destruction.

One component of communication, patient-clinician information engagement (PCIE), predicts improved short-term patient-reported outcomes, such as treatment satisfaction, through perceptions of feeling informed. However, to the authors' knowledge, the relation between PCIE and longer term cancer-related problems has not been examined previously. The authors examined the influence of PCIE on self-reported problems associated with cancer diagnosis and treatment based on a longitudinal survey among a randomly selected sample from the 2005 Pennsylvania Cancer Registry.  Methods:   In total, 1293 respondents were surveyed who were diagnosed with colorectal, breast, or prostate cancers during 2006 and 2007. The baseline response rate was 64%, and the retention rate was 65%. The authors predicted an index of cancer-related problems at 1-year follow-up with the baseline cancer-related problem index and PCIE, controlling for demographic and clinical factors using regression analyses. The mean age of participants was 65 years, approximately 50% were women, and 86% were white.  Results:   Having more cancer-related problems and PCIE at baseline significantly predicted more cancer-related problems at follow-up. In addition, baseline cancer-related problems and PCIE interacted significantly (P = .01): PCIE was associated with more cancer-related problems at follow-up among participants who reported more symptoms rather than fewer symptoms at baseline.  Conclusions:   If respondents reported engaging more with their physicians at baseline, then they reported experiencing more cancer-related issues at follow-up; this pattern was stronger among those who reported more baseline problems. The current results indicated that increased discussion of cancer information with physicians may maintain the salience of these problems in cancer survivors' minds over time.""","""['Andy S L Tan', 'Angel Bourgoin', 'Stacy W Gray', 'Katrina Armstrong', 'Robert C Hornik']""","""[]""","""2011""","""None""","""Cancer""","""['Patient-clinician information engagement improves adherence to colorectal cancer surveillance after curative treatment: results from a longitudinal study.', 'Patient-clinician information engagement increases treatment decision satisfaction among cancer patients through feeling of being informed.', 'A longitudinal study on engagement with dieting information as a predictor of dieting behavior among adults diagnosed with cancer.', 'Exercise interventions on health-related quality of life for people with cancer during active treatment.', 'A national survey of oncology survivors examining nutrition attitudes, problems and behaviours, and access to dietetic care throughout the cancer journey.', 'Physician perspectives on colorectal cancer surveillance care in a changing environment.', 'The role of patient-clinician information engagement and information seeking from nonmedical channels in fruit and vegetable intake among cancer patients.', ""Does the number of cancer patients' close social ties affect cancer-related information seeking through communication efficacy?

Methods:   We used the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results program to identify 1,260,898 patients diagnosed in 2004 through 2008 with lung, colorectal, breast, pancreatic, prostate, liver/intrahepatic bile duct, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, head/neck, ovarian, or esophageal cancer. We used multivariable logistic and Cox regression to analyze the 734,889 patients who had clinical and follow-up information available.  Results:   Married patients were less likely to present with metastatic disease (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 0.83; 95% CI, 0.82 to 0.84; P < .001), more likely to receive definitive therapy (adjusted OR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.51 to 1.56; P < .001), and less likely to die as a result of their cancer after adjusting for demographics, stage, and treatment (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.79 to 0.81; P < .001) than unmarried patients.

Materials and methods:   Prospectively collected longitudinal data of 277 RRP and 730 RARP cases over a 5-year period were retrospectively analyzed. The RARP series were divided into 3 subgroups (1st, <250 cases; 2nd, 250-500; and 3rd, >500) according to the surgical period. The positive surgical margin (PSM) and biochemical recurrence-free survival (BCRFS) rates were compared at each pathological stage.  Results:   The pT2 PSM rates showed no significant difference between the RRP (7.8%) and RARP series (1st, 9.5%; 2nd, 14.1%; and 3rd, 9.8%) throughout the study period (P = 0.689, 0.079, and 0.688, respectively).

In observational studies, patients may receive additional therapy by choice; the time to metastasis without any therapy is often a potential outcome and not always observed.

Methods:   The Prostate Cancer Risk Assessment Program (PRAP) is a longitudinal screening program for high-risk men. The eligibility includes men aged between 35 and 69 years with a family history of prostate cancer or African descent. Participants with 1 follow-up visit were included in the analyses (n=477).

Materials and methods:   In this study we analyzed serum levels of these inflammatory markers along with prostate-specific antigens (PSA) in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH, n = 55), localized prostate cancers (PCa, n = 55), and metastatic prostate cancers (mPCa, n = 27) using immunological assays.  Results:   We found that in comparison to healthy individuals (n = 55), patients with BPH, PCa and mPCa have elevated serum levels of SAA, sPLA₂-IIA, and CRP, in addition to elevated levels of PSA. Significant differences with respect to inflammatory biomarkers were found between localized and metastatic PCa (p < 0.001), suggesting a prognostic value of these parameters. In addition, serum concentrations of SAA and sPLA₂-IIA positively correlate with CRP in BPH patients (p < 0.05) and in patients with PCa and mPCa (p < 0.001), but not with PSA levels, Gleason score, or tumor stage, emphasizing a role of SAA and sPLA₂-IIA as circulating biomarkers of inflammation rather than of neoplastic transformation. In contrast to PSA, which differed significantly between BPH and localized PCa patients (p < 0.01), such a difference was not found for SAA, sPLA₂-IIA, and CRP. In order to elucidate whether the elevated levels of SAA and sPLA₂-IIA can be caused by cancer cell-associated synthesis, in vitro studies were performed. These analyses demonstrated the expression of SAA and sPLA₂-IIA in LNCaP and PC-3 prostate cell lines, which can be further upregulated by pro-inflammatory cytokines in a cell type-dependent manner. This might suggest that, in addition to the hepatic origin, SAA and sPLA₂-IIA can also be synthesized and secreted by prostatic cancer tissue itself.  Conclusion:   The results of the present study emphasize the utility of SAA, sPLA₂-IIA, and CRP as circulating biomarkers of inflammation during BPH development and PCa progression.""","""['Mario Menschikowski', 'Albert Hagelgans', 'Susanne Fuessel', 'Olga A Mareninova', 'Liana Asatryan', 'Manfred P Wirth', 'Gabriele Siegert']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Inflamm Res""","""['Serum levels of secreted group IIA phospholipase A(2) in benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer: a biomarker for inflammation or neoplasia?', 'Differential expression of secretory phospholipases A2 in normal and malignant prostate cell lines: regulation by cytokines, cell signaling pathways, and epigenetic mechanisms.', 'Secretory phospholipase A2, group IIA is a novel serum amyloid A target gene: activation of smooth muscle cell expression by an interleukin-1 receptor-independent mechanism.', 'The Association of Acute Phase Proteins in Stress and Inflammation-Induced T2D.', 'Phloretin in Benign Prostate Hyperplasia and Prostate Cancer: A Contemporary Systematic Review.', 'SAA1 identified as a potential prediction biomarker for metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma via multi-omics approaches.', 'SAA1 Expression as a Potential Prognostic Marker of the Tumor Microenvironment in Glioblastoma.', 'Biomarkers That Differentiate Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia from Prostate Cancer: A Literature Review.', 'P. acnes-Driven Disease Pathology: Current Knowledge and Future Directions.', 'Serum amyloid A1 is upregulated in human glioblastoma.']"""

Materials and methods:   All patients who underwent radical prostatectomy at two high-volume United States academic institutions at separate geographic locations between 1990 and 2011 were identified. Demographic data, pre-operative Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA), biopsy Gleason score, pathology Gleason score, pathology Stage, margin status, and node status were collected. In addition to SA men, African American (AA) men were identified and used for comparative analysis as a high-risk cohort.  Results:   A total of 69 SA men were identified in Cohort 1 and 24 men were identified in Cohort 2. When comparing SA men against the entire cohort, no significant difference was found for age, year of surgery, biopsy Gleason score, or path Gleason score for either cohort. However, significant differences were found in pre-operative PSA (P = 0.01), pathologic stage (P<0.01), and positive node status (P = 0.04) for SA men in Cohort 1. Whereas in Cohort 2, SA men had a significantly higher proportion of positive surgical margins (P = 0.04). In all significant comparisons, characteristics were worse in SA men and similar to that of AA men.

We compared the transient activity of the MUASMSCP promoter in tobacco/Arabidopsis protoplasts and in whole plant (Petunia hybrida) with the same that obtained from CaMV35S and MUAS35SCP promoters individually. The MUASMSCP promoter showed 1.1 and 1.5 times stronger GUS-activities over that obtained from MUAS35SCP and CaMV35S promoters respectively, in tobacco (Xanthi Brad) protoplasts. In transgenic tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum, var. Samsun NN), the MUASMSCP promoter showed 1.1 and 2.2 times stronger activities than MUAS35SCP and CaMV35S(2) promoters respectively. We observed a fair correlation between MUASMSCP-, MUAS35SCP- and CaMV35S(2)-driven GUS activities with the corresponding uidA-mRNA level in transgenic plants. X-gluc staining of transgenic germinating seed-sections and whole seedlings also support above findings. Protein-extracts made from tobacco protoplasts expressing GFP and human-IL-24 genes driven individually by the MUASMSCP promoter showed enhanced expression of the reporters compared to that obtained from the CaMV35S promoter. Furthermore, MUASMSCP-driven protoplast-derived human IL-24 showed enhanced cell inhibitory activity in DU-145 prostate cancer cells compared to that obtained from the CaMV35S promoter.

However, to our knowledge a new concept called prostate specific antigen velocity risk count, recently validated in a screening cohort, has not been investigated in an active surveillance cohort.  Materials and methods:   We evaluated a cohort of men from 1995 to 2012 with prostate cancer on active surveillance. They had stage T1c disease, prostate specific antigen density less than 0.15 ng/ml, Gleason score 6 or less, 2 or fewer biopsy cores and 50% or less involvement of any core with cancer. The men were observed by semiannual prostate specific antigen measurements, digital rectal examinations and an annual surveillance biopsy. Treatment was recommended for biopsy reclassification. Patients with 30 months or greater of followup and 3 serial prostate specific antigen velocity measurements were used in primary analysis by logistic regression, Cox proportional hazards, Kaplan-Meier analysis and performance parameters, including the AUC of the ROC curve.  Results:   Primary analysis included 275 of 668 men who met very low risk inclusion criteria, of whom 83 (30.2%) were reclassified at a median of 57.1 months. Reclassification risk increased with risk count, that is a risk count of 3 (HR 4.63, 95% CI 1.54-13.87) and 2 (HR 3.73, 95% CI 1.75-7.97) compared to zero. Results were similar for Gleason score reclassification (HR 7.45, 95% CI 1.60-34.71 and 3.96, 95% CI 1.35-11.62, respectively). On secondary analysis the negative predictive value (risk count 1 or less) was 91.5% for reclassification in the next year. Adding the prostate specific antigen velocity risk count improved the AUC in a model including baseline prostate specific antigen density (0.7423 vs 0.6818, p = 0.025) and it outperformed the addition of overall prostate specific antigen velocity (0.7423 vs 0.6960, p = 0.037).

Screening of 2 × 109 clone landscape phage library provides a reliable avenue for generating protein ligands specific for tumor cells. It was shown that selective phage proteins derived from landscape phage libraries against breast and prostate cancer cells are able to navigate drug or siRNA loaded liposomes to corresponding cancer cells with minimal toxicity to non-neoplastic cells. In an alternative platform, glioma cell-specific phage proteins were used for assembling in vivo cancer-specific phage-like particles, named 'phagemid infective particles' as targeted gene-delivery vehicles.  Methods:   To extend the panel of anticancer cell phages, we have screened a 2 × 109 clone landscape phage library f8/8 to select phage clones specific for metastatic prostate cancer cell PC-3M. The phage clones were characterized for their selective interaction with PC-3M cells using phage capture assay, immunofluorescence microscopy and electron microscopy. A prostate cancer selective phage was converted to phage-like particles harboring emerald green fluorescent protein.  Results:   Phage clone EPTHSWAT (designated by the sequence of inserted peptide) was found to be most selective for PC-3M cells and was observed to internalize PC-3M cells as revealed by immunofluorescence microscopy and electron microscopy. Conversion of this phage to phage-like particles harboring emerald green fluorescent protein and the expression of emerald green fluorescent protein in the phage-like particles treated PC-3M cells showed potential of adoption of this phage-like particle in prostate cancer therapeutic gene delivery.  Conclusion:   Successful employment of phage-like particles expressing emerald green fluorescent protein genes targeted to prostate cancer cells PC-3M confirms a prospect of their use for targeted delivery of therapeutic genes to cancer cells.""","""['Olusegun A Fagbohun', 'Robert A Kazmierczak', 'Valery A Petrenko', 'Abraham Eisenstark']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Nanobiotechnology""","""['Cell targeted phagemid rescued by preselected landscape phage.', 'Preparation of peptide-targeted phagemid particles using a protein III-modified helper phage.', 'Ectopic expression of the ATP synthase β subunit on the membrane of PC-3M cells supports its potential role in prostate cancer metastasis.', 'Targeting of phage display vectors to mammalian cells.', 'Evolving phage vectors for cell targeted gene delivery.', 'Bacteriophages as Therapeutic and Diagnostic Vehicles in Cancer.', 'Combinatorial Avidity Selection of Mosaic Landscape Phages Targeted at Breast Cancer Cells-An Alternative Mechanism of Directed Molecular Evolution.', ""Paradigm shift in bacteriophage-mediated delivery of anticancer drugs: from targeted 'magic bullets' to self-navigated 'magic missiles'."", 'Genetically Engineered Phages: a Review of Advances over the Last Decade.', 'Beyond phage display: non-traditional applications of the filamentous bacteriophage as a vaccine carrier, therapeutic biologic, and bioconjugation scaffold.']"""

Materials and methods:   Fifty-five patients who underwent a 3-T prostate MRI examination using a pelvic phased-array coil and incorporating T2-weighted imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging, and dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging were included in the study. Three radiologists (6, 4, and 1 year of experience) independently scored 18 regions (12 in the peripheral zone [PZ] and six in the transition zone [TZ]) using PI-RADS (range, 3-15) and Likert (range, 1-5) scales, which were based on fixed criteria and overall impression, respectively. Interreader reproducibility was evaluated using the concordance correlation coefficient (CCC), which assesses exact agreement between scores (minimal, < 0.2; poor, 0.2-<0.4; moderate, 0.4-<0.6; strong, 0.6-<0.8; almost perfect, ≥ 0.8).  Results:   Agreement between experienced readers was strong in the PZ and TZ combined and in the PZ for both the PI-RADS and Likert scales (CCC = 0.608-0.677), moderate in the TZ for the Likert scale (CCC = 0.519), and poor in the TZ for PI-RADS (CCC = 0.376). Agreement between experienced and inexperienced readers was moderate to poor in the PZ and TZ combined for PI-RADS (CCC = 0.340-0.477), moderate in the PZ and TZ combined for the Likert scale (CCC = 0.471-0.497), moderate in the PZ for PI-RADS and Likert scales (CCC = 0.472-0.542), minimal to poor in the TZ for PI-RADS (CCC = 0.094-0.283), and poor in the TZ for the Likert scale (CCC = 0.287-0.400).

Materials and methods:   Fifty-eight active surveillance candidates (prostate-specific antigen concentration, < 10 ng/mL; clinical tumor category less than T2a; Gleason score, 3 + 3; ≤ 25% of biopsy cores positive for tumor; ≤ 50% tumor involvement of any individual core; ≤ 20% tumor involvement across all cores) who underwent prostatectomy and preoperative 3-T MRI including diffusional kurtosis imaging (b values, 0, 500, 1000, 1500, and 2000 s/mm(2)) were included. Adverse pathologic features at prostatectomy were defined using two schemes of varying stringency. One scheme (less stringent) was presence of a Gleason score greater than 6 or extracapsular extension (n = 19). The other scheme (more stringent) was presence of a Gleason score greater than 6, extracapsular extension, or an index tumor 10 mm or larger (n = 35). Parametric maps displaying standard apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), kurtosis (K) representing nongaussian diffusion behavior, and diffusion (D) representing a diffusion coefficient adjusted for nongaussian (kurtosis) behavior were reviewed, and the most abnormal region was recorded for each metric. Associations between these metrics and the presence of adverse final pathologic findings were assessed with unpaired Student t tests and receiver operating characteristic analyses.  Results:   For both schemes, only D was significantly lower in patients with adverse final pathologic findings (p = 0.006, p = 0.025). K tended to be greater in patients with adverse final pathologic findings for the more stringent scheme (p = 0.072). ADC was not significantly different in the presence of adverse final pathologic findings for either scheme (p = 0.357, p = 0.383). With either scheme, D had a larger area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) for predicting adverse final pathologic results (AUC, 0.691 and 0.743) than did ADC (AUC, 0.569 and 0.655) or K (AUC, 0.617 and 0.714), but the difference was not significant (p = 0.183, p = 0.734).

Docetaxel, an antimitotic drug that is the first-line treatment strategy for CRPC, is known to provide a small survival benefit. However, docetaxel chemotherapy alone is not enough to counteract the high levels of Bcl-2/Bcl-xL/Mcl-1 present in CRPC. ABT-737 is a small molecule that binds to Bcl-2/Bcl-xL (but not Mcl-1) with high affinity and disrupts their interaction with pro-apoptotic Bax/Bak, thus enhancing apoptosis. Our results indicate that ABT-737 can sensitize androgen-dependent LNCaP and CRPC PC3 cells to docetaxel- and to the novel antimitotic ENMD-1198-mediated caspase-dependent apoptosis. CRPC DU145 cells, however, are more resistant to ABT-737 because they are Bax null and not because they express the highest levels of anti-apoptotic Mcl-1 (associated with ABT-737 resistance). Knockdown of Bax or Bak in LNCaP indicates that ABT-737-induced antimitotic enhancement of apoptosis is more dependent on the levels of Bax than Bak. Furthermore, we find that the ability of docetaxel to increase cyclin B1/Cdk1-mediated phosphorylation of Bcl-2/Bcl-xL and decrease Mcl-1 is required for ABT-737 to enhance apoptosis in PC3 cells, as determined by addition of Cdk1 inhibitor purvalanol A and expression of shRNA specific for cyclin B1. Overall, our data suggests that the high levels of anti-apoptotic proteins in Bax-expressing CRPC cells can be overcome by targeting Bcl-2/Bcl-xL with ABT-737 and Mcl-1 with antimitotics.""","""['Ricardo Parrondo', 'Alicia de Las Pozas', 'Teresita Reiner', 'Carlos Perez-Stable']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""PeerJ""","""['Mcl-1 down-regulation potentiates ABT-737 lethality by cooperatively inducing Bak activation and Bax translocation.', 'Induction of Noxa sensitizes human colorectal cancer cells expressing Mcl-1 to the small-molecule Bcl-2/Bcl-xL inhibitor, ABT-737.', 'MCL-1 and BCL-xL-dependent resistance to the BCL-2 inhibitor ABT-199 can be overcome by preventing PI3K/AKT/mTOR activation in lymphoid malignancies.', 'Combining paclitaxel with ABT-263 has a synergistic effect on paclitaxel resistant prostate cancer cells.', 'Targeting multiple arms of the apoptotic regulatory machinery.', 'Protein Levels of Anti-Apoptotic Mcl-1 and the Deubiquitinase USP9x Are Cooperatively Upregulated during Prostate Cancer Progression and Limit Response of Prostate Cancer Cells to Radiotherapy.', 'Repurposing BCL-2 and Jak 1/2 inhibitors: Cure and treatment of HIV-1 and other viral infections.', 'Novel BH4-BCL-2 Domain Antagonists Induce BCL-2-Mediated Apoptosis in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer.', 'Mechanisms of cancer cell death induction by paclitaxel: an updated review.', 'Novel Therapies in Myeloproliferative Neoplasms: Beyond JAK Inhibitor Monotherapy.']"""

However, many studies failed to detect XMRV and to verify these disease associations. Data suggesting the contamination of specimens in particular by PCR-based methods and recent reports demonstrating XMRV generation via recombination of two murine leukemia virus precursors raised serious doubts about XMRV being a genuine human pathogen. To elucidate cell tropism of XMRV, we generated replication competent XMRV reporter viruses encoding a green fluorescent protein or a secretable luciferase as tools to analyze virus infection of human cell lines or primary human cells. Transfection of proviral DNAs into LNCaP prostate cancer cells resulted in readily detectably reporter gene expression and production of progeny virus. Inoculation of known XMRV susceptible target cells revealed that these virions were infectious and expressed the reporter gene, allowing for a fast and highly sensitive quantification of XMRV infection. Both reporter viruses were capable of establishing a spreading infection in LNCaP and Raji B cells and could be easily passaged. However, after inoculation of primary human blood cells such as CD4 T cells, macrophages or dendritic cells, infection rates were very low, and a spreading infection was never established. In line with these results we found that supernatants derived from these XMRV infected primary cell types did not contain infectious virus. Thus, although XMRV efficiently replicated in some human cell lines, all tested primary cells were largely refractory to XMRV infection and did not support viral spread. Our results provide further evidence that XMRV is not a human pathogen.""","""['Christina Martina Stürzel', 'David Palesch', 'Mohammad Khalid', 'Silke Wissing', 'Nicole Fischer', 'Jan Münch']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Severe restriction of xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus replication and spread in cultured human peripheral blood mononuclear cells.', 'Restricted replication of xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus in pigtailed macaques.', 'Inhibition of xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus by APOBEC3 proteins and antiviral drugs.', 'Evidence and controversies on the role of XMRV in prostate cancer and chronic fatigue syndrome.', 'Recombinant origin, contamination, and de-discovery of XMRV.', 'Frequent infection of human cancer xenografts with murine endogenous retroviruses in vivo.', 'Prevention of contamination by xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus: susceptibility to alcohol-based disinfectants and environmental stability.']"""

For this purpose LNCaP cells were used for in vitro experiments and nude mice in which PAC120 (hormone-dependent human prostate cancer) xenografts had been implanted were used for in vivo examinations. We provide evidence that increasing glucose concentrations downregulate androgen receptor (AR) mRNA and protein levels through NF-κB activation in LNCaP cells. Moreover, there was a synergic effect of glucose and TNFα in downregulating the AR in LNCaP cells. By contrast, insulin had no effect on AR regulation. In vivo experiments showed that streptozotocin-induced diabetes (STZ-DM) produces tumor growth retardation and a significant reduction in AR expression in PAC120 prostate cancer mice.

We measured epinephrine levels in blood samples collected immediately prior to prostate biopsies and measured phosphorylation of S133CREB (PKA site), S112BAD, T202/Y204ERK, and S473 Akt in prostate biopsy tissue samples.  Methods:   Tissue samples and 3 ml of blood were obtained from men (n = 20) recruited from the patients scheduled for prostate biopsies. Epinephrine levels were measured by ELISA. Proteins were extracted from biopsied tissue, and protein phosphorylation was measured by Western blotting with phospho-specific antibodies. Pearson and Spearman's rank correlations were analyzed to assess relationships between blood epinephrine levels and phosphorylation of CREB, BAD, AKT, and ERK.  Results:   Epinephrine levels above 1 nM were detected in 5 of 20 patients. A strong positive correlation was observed between increased epinephrine levels and CREB phosphorylation. In contrast, no correlation was observed between epinephrine levels and phosphorylation of ERK, BAD, or AKT.

On multivariate analysis, GS, nadir PSA (nPSA) and a pre-EBRT PSA ≤5 ng/mL significantly affected bDFS, while Gleason score (GS) and T stage significantly affected distant metastases onset. No factors affected CSS at multivariate analysis.  Conclusions:   EBRT may be a suitable therapeutic option, able to provide an excellent loco-regional control and to obtain a systemic disease control in up to 60 % of patients at 5 years, especially in patients presenting with lower Gleason score and T stage at diagnosis and lower pre-RT PSA and nPSA post-RT.""","""['Angela Botticella', 'Alessia Guarneri', 'Andrea Riccardo Filippi', 'Niccolò Giaj Levra', 'Fernando Munoz', 'Riccardo Ragona', 'Paolo Gontero', 'Umberto Ricardi']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Cancer Res Clin Oncol""","""['Unification of a common biochemical failure definition for prostate cancer treated with brachytherapy or external beam radiotherapy with or without androgen deprivation.', 'PSA nadir predicts biochemical and distant failures after external beam radiotherapy for prostate cancer: a multi-institutional analysis.', 'Predictors of poor response to first-generation anti-androgens as criteria for alternate treatments for patients with non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Intermediate-risk localized prostate cancer in the PSA era: radiotherapeutic alternatives.', 'Unmet needs in the prediction and detection of metastases in prostate cancer.', 'Nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer treated with salvage focal brachytherapy after external beam radiotherapy.', 'Outcome of loco-regional radiotherapy in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients treated with abiraterone acetate.', 'Long-term outcomes of definitive external-beam radiotherapy for non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'External beam radiation for the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer following primary hormonal therapy with androgen ablation: Analysis and outcome of 21 patients.', 'Nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.']"""

Here, we report that miR-26a enhances miRNA biogenesis, which acts as a common mechanism partially accounting for miR-26a function in diverse cancers including melanoma, prostate and liver cancer. miR-26a was broadly reduced in multiple cancers, and overexpression of miR-26a significantly suppressed tumor growth and metastasis both in vitro and in vivo, including melanoma, prostate and liver cancers. Notably, miR-26a overexpression was accompanied by global upregulation of miRNAs, especially let-7, and let-7 expression was concordant with miR-26a expression in cancer cell lines, xenograft tumors and normal human tissues, underscoring their biological relevance. We showed that miR-26a directly targeted Lin28B and Zcchc11-two critical repressors of let-7 maturation. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that Zcchc11 promoted tumor growth and metastasis, and it was prominently overexpressed in human cancers. Our findings thus provide a novel mechanism by which a miRNA acts as a modulator of miRNA biogenesis. These results also define a role of the miR-26a and Zcchc11 in tumorigenesis and metastasis and have implications to develop new strategies for cancer therapy.""","""['X Fu', 'Z Meng', 'W Liang', 'Y Tian', 'X Wang', 'W Han', 'G Lou', 'X Wang', 'F Lou', 'Y Yen', 'H Yu', 'R Jove', 'W Huang']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['miR-203 enhances let-7 biogenesis by targeting LIN28B to suppress tumor growth in lung cancer.', 'miR-26a suppresses EMT by disrupting the Lin28B/let-7d axis: potential cross-talks among miRNAs in IPF.', 'MicroRNA-26a regulates tumorigenic properties of EZH2 in human lung carcinoma cells.', 'The role of LIN28B in tumor progression and metastasis in solid tumor entities.', 'The emerging role of miR-653 in human cancer.', 'Circular RNAs in hepatocellular carcinoma: biogenesis, function, and pathology.', 'Follicular Fluid-Derived Small Extracellular Vesicles Alleviate DHEA-Induced Granulosa Cell Apoptosis by Delivering LINC00092.', 'RNA splicing factor Rbm25 underlies heterogeneous preleukemic clonal expansion in mice.', 'miR-26a-5p Regulates Adipocyte Differentiation via Directly Targeting ACSL3 in Adipocytes.', 'A miRNA-mediated attenuation of hepatocarcinogenesis in both hepatocytes and Kupffer cells.']"""

Infections, mostly by encapsulated organisms, are the most well-known complications following splenectomy. Recently, thrombosis and cancer have become recognized as potential adverse outcomes post-splenectomy. Among more than 4 million hospitalized USA veterans, we assessed incidence and mortality due to infections, thromboembolism, and cancer including 8,149 cancer-free veterans who underwent splenectomy with a follow-up of up to 27 years. Relative risk estimates and 95% confidence intervals were calculated using time-dependent Poisson regression methods for cohort data. Splenectomized patients had an increased risk of being hospitalized for pneumonia, meningitis, and septicemia (rate ratios=1.9-3.4); deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism (rate ratios=2.2); certain solid tumors: buccal, esophagus, liver, colon, pancreas, lung, and prostate (rate ratios =1.3-1.9); and hematologic malignancies: non-Hodgkin lymphoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, multiple myeloma, acute myeloid leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, chronic myeloid leukemia, and any leukemia (rate ratios =1.8-6.0). They also had an increased risk of death due to pneumonia and septicemia (rate ratios =1.6-3.0); pulmonary embolism and coronary artery disease (rate ratios =1.4-4.5); any cancer: liver, pancreas, and lung cancer, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, and any leukemia (rate ratios =1.3-4.7).

AR is a key protein in growth and development of both normal and malignant prostate, making it a common therapeutic target in prostate cancer. AR is regulated by an interplay of multiple post-translational modifications including ubiquitination. We and others have shown that the AR is ubiquitinated by a number of E3 ubiquitin ligases, including MDM2, CHIP, and NEDD4, which can result in its proteosomal degradation or enhanced transcriptional activity. As ubiquitination of AR causes a change in AR activity or stability and impacts both survival and growth of prostate cancer cells, deubiquitination of these sites has an equally important role. Hence, deubiquitinating enzymes could offer novel therapeutic targets. We performed an siRNA screen to identify deubiquitinating enzymes that regulate AR; in that screen ubiquitin-specific protease 12 (Usp12) was identified as a novel positive regulator of AR. Usp12 is a poorly characterized protein with few known functions and requires the interaction with two cofactors, Uaf-1 and WDR20, for its enzymatic activity. In this report we demonstrate that Usp12, in complex with Uaf-1 and WDR20, deubiquitinates the AR to enhance receptor stability and transcriptional activity.

Aim. This study estimates the costs of identifying a new case of PCa by screening asymptomatic men.  Methods:   Men aged 40+, who had PSA tests in 31 general practices in the Midland Cancer Network region during 2010, were identified. Asymptomatic men without a history of PCa were eligible for this study. A decision tree was constructed to estimate the screening costs. We assumed GPs spent 3 minutes of the initial consultation on informed consent of PCa screening.  Results:   About 70.7% of the estimated costs were incurred in general practice. The screening costs per cancer detected were NZ$10 777 (€5820; £4817). The estimated costs for men aged 60-69 were NZ$6268 compared to NZ$24 290 for men aged 40-49, NZ$30 022 for 50-59 and NZ$10 957 for those aged 70+. The costs for Māori were NZ$7685 compared to NZ$11 272 for non-Māori. The costs for men without PSA testing history in 2007-09 were NZ$8887 compared to NZ$13 870 if the men had PSA tests in 2007-09. If we assumed a PSA test involved a full 15-minute general practice consultation, the estimated costs increased to NZ$26 877 per PCa identified.  Conclusions:   Screening of asymptomatic men for PCa is widely practiced. Most of the costs of screening were incurred in general practice. Calls for men to receive increased information on the harms and benefits of screening will substantially increase the costs. The current costs could be reduced by better targeting of screening.""","""['Chunhuan Lao', 'Charis Brown', 'Zuzana Obertová', 'Richard Edlin', 'Paul Rouse', 'Fraser Hodgson', 'Michael Holmes', 'Peter Gilling', 'Ross Lawrenson']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Fam Pract""","""['Screening for prostate cancer in New Zealand general practice.', 'Current and projected annual direct costs of screening asymptomatic men for prostate cancer using prostate-specific antigen.', ""PSA screening in New Zealand: total population results and general practitioners' current attitudes and practices."", 'Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA)-Based Population Screening for Prostate Cancer: An Economic Analysis.', 'The economics of prostate cancer screening.', 'Development and demonstration of a state model for the estimation of incidence of partly undetected chronic diseases.']"""

The molecular mechanism of STS gene expression, however, is still not clear. Growth factors are known to increase STS activity but the changes in STS expression have not been completely understood. To determine whether insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-II can induce STS gene expression, the effects of IGF-II on STS expression were studied in PC-3 human prostate cancer cells. RT-PCR and Western blot analysis showed that IGF-II treatment significantly increased the expression of STS mRNA and protein in concentration- and time-dependent manners. To understand the signaling pathway by which IGF-II induces STS gene expression, the effects of specific PI3-kinase/Akt and NF-κB inhibitors were determined. When the cells were treated with IGF-II and PI3-kinase/Akt inhibitors, such as LY294002, wortmannin, or Akt inhibitor IV, STS expression induced by IGF-II was significantly blocked. Moreover, we found that NF-κB inhibitors, such as MG-132, bortezomib, Bay 11-7082 or Nemo binding domain (NBD) binding peptide, also strongly prevented IGF-II from inducing STS gene expression. We assessed whether IGF-II activates STS promoter activity using transient transfection with a luciferase reporter. IGF-II significantly stimulated STS reporter activity. Furthermore, IGF-II induced expression of 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (HSD) 1 and 3, whereas it reduced estrone sulfotransferase (EST) gene expression, causing enhanced estrone and β-estradiol production. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that IGF-II induces STS expression via a PI3-kinase/Akt-NF-κB signaling pathway in PC-3 cells and may induce estrogen production and estrogen-mediated carcinogenesis.""","""['Chul-Hoon Sung', 'Hee-Jung Im', 'Nahee Park', 'Yeojung Kwon', 'Sangyun Shin', 'Dong-Jin Ye', 'Nam-Hyeon Cho', 'Young-Shin Park', 'Hyung-Kyoon Choi', 'Donghak Kim', 'Young-Jin Chun']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Toxicol Lett""","""['Induction of steroid sulfatase expression by tumor necrosis factor-α through phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt signaling pathway in PC-3 human prostate cancer cells.', 'Lipopolysaccharide enhances Wnt5a expression through toll-like receptor 4, myeloid differentiating factor 88, phosphatidylinositol 3-OH kinase/AKT and nuclear factor kappa B pathways in human dental pulp stem cells.', 'Insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-II regulates CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha expression via phosphatidyl-inositol 3 kinase in human hepatoblastoma cell lines.', 'New development in intracrinology of breast carcinoma.', 'Steroid sulfatase and estrogen sulfotransferase in human carcinomas.', 'Steroid sulfatase deficiency causes cellular senescence and abnormal differentiation by inducing Yippee-like 3 expression in human keratinocytes.', 'Dysregulated androgen synthesis and anti-androgen resistance in advanced prostate cancer.', 'Human steroid sulfatase induces Wnt/β-catenin signaling and epithelial-mesenchymal transition by upregulating Twist1 and HIF-1α in human prostate and cervical cancer cells.', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I Receptor (IGF-IR) Ligands and BMI in Squamous Intra-Epithelial Lesion (SIL) of Cervix.', 'The Important Roles of Steroid Sulfatase and Sulfotransferases in Gynecological Diseases.']"""

Many patients develop castration resistance (castration-resistant PCa [CRPC]) after approximately 2-3 yr, with a poor prognosis. The molecular mechanisms underlying CRPC progression are unclear.  Objective:   To undertake quantitative tumour transcriptome profiling prior to and following ADT to identify functionally important androgen-regulated pathways or genes that may be reactivated in CRPC.  Design, setting, and participants:   RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was performed on tumour-rich, targeted prostatic biopsies from seven patients with locally advanced or metastatic PCa before and approximately 22 wk after ADT initiation. Differentially regulated genes were identified in treatment pairs and further investigated by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) on cell lines and immunohistochemistry on a separate CRPC patient cohort. Functional assays were used to determine the effect of pathway modulation on cell phenotypes.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   We searched for gene expression changes affecting key cell signalling pathways that may be targeted as proof of principle in a CRPC in vitro cell line model.  Results and limitations:   We identified ADT-regulated signalling pathways, including the Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway, and observed overexpression of β-catenin in a subset of CRPC by immunohistochemistry. We validated 6 of 12 (50%) pathway members by qRT-PCR on LNCaP/LNCaP-AI cell RNAs, of which 4 (67%) demonstrated expression changes consistent with RNA-seq data. We show that the tankyrase inhibitor XAV939 (which promotes β-catenin degradation) reduced androgen-independent LNCaP-AI cell line growth compared with androgen-responsive LNCaP cells via an accumulation of cell proportions in the G0/G1 phase and reduction in the S and G2/M phases. Our biopsy protocol did not account for tumour heterogeneity, and pathway inhibition was limited to pharmacologic approaches.  Conclusions:   RNA-seq of paired PCa samples revealed ADT-regulated signalling pathways. Proof-of-principle inhibition of the Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway specifically delays androgen-independent PCa cell cycle progression and proliferation and warrants further investigation as a potential target for therapy for CRPC.""","""['Prabhakar Rajan', 'Ian M Sudbery', 'M Eugenia M Villasevil', 'Ernest Mui', 'Janis Fleming', 'Mark Davis', 'Imran Ahmad', 'Joanne Edwards', 'Owen J Sansom', 'David Sims', 'Chris P Ponting', 'Andreas Heger', 'Rhona M McMenemin', 'Ian D Pedley', 'Hing Y Leung']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Molecular characterization of prostate cancer following androgen deprivation: the devil in the details.', 'Pre-existing Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer-like Cells in Primary Prostate Cancer Promote Resistance to Hormonal Therapy.', 'Transcript Levels of Androgen Receptor Variant 7 and Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzyme 2C in Hormone Sensitive Prostate Cancer and Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'EAU guidelines on prostate cancer.

The goal of this study was to determine whether these findings could be independently confirmed in the Caucasian population from the South Texas area.  Methods and materials:   The study subjects consisted of participants of the San Antonio Biomarkers of Risk for PCa cohort and additional cases ascertained in the same metropolitan area. We genotyped all 7 of the reported copy number variants using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction in 1,536 (317 cases and 1,219 controls) non-Hispanic Caucasian men, and additionally, we genotyped 632 (191 cases and 441 controls) Hispanic Caucasian men for one of these variants, a deletion on 2p24.3.  Results:   Association of the deletion on 2p24.3 with overall PCa risk did not meet our significance criteria but was consistent with previous reports (odds ratio, 1.40; 95% confidence interval 0.99-2.00; P = 0.06). Among Hispanic Caucasians, this deletion is much less prevalent (minor allele frequencies of 0.059 and 0.024 in non-Hispanic and Hispanic Caucasians, respectively) and did not show evidence of association with risk for PCa. Interestingly, among non-Hispanic Caucasians, carrying a homozygous deletion of 2p24.3 was significantly associated with high-grade PCa as defined by Gleason score sum ≥8 (odds ratio, 27.99; 95% confidence interval 1.99-392.6; P = 0.007 [the Fisher exact test]). The remaining 6 copy number variable regions either were not polymorphic in our cohort of non-Hispanic Caucasians or showed no evidence of association.  Conclusions:   Our findings are consistent with the reported observation that a heritable deletion on 2p24.3 is associated with PCa risk in non-Hispanic Caucasians. Additionally, our observations indicate that the 2p24.3 variant is associated with risk for high-grade PCa in a recessive manner.

These studies revealed a reverse correlation between the likelihood of prostate cancer risk and the use of L-type calcium channel blockers among men without family history but the mechanism was not clear. In this study, we examined the expression profiles of multiple L-type calcium channel genes in prostate cancers and determined their functional roles in androgen receptor (AR) transactivation and cell growth. By reanalyzing the ONCOMINE database, we found that L-type calcium channel CACNA1D gene expression levels in cancer tissues were significantly higher than noncancer tissues in 14 of 15 published complementary deoxyribonucleic acid microarray data sets, of which 9 data sets showed an increase of 2- to 17-folds. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunostaining experiments revealed that CACNA1D gene and its coding protein α1D were highly expressed in prostate cancers, especially in castration-resistant diseases, compared with benign prostate tissues. Consistent with the notion of CACNA1D as an ERG-regulated gene, CACNA1D gene expression levels were significantly higher in prostate cancers with TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion compared with the cases without this gene fusion. Blocking L-type channel's function or knocking down CACNA1D gene expression significantly suppressed androgen-stimulated Ca(2+) influx, AR transactivation, and cell growth in prostate cancer cells. Taken together, these data suggest that CACNA1D gene overexpression is associated with prostate cancer progression and might play an important role in Ca(2+) influx, AR activation, and cell growth in prostate cancer cells.""","""['Ruibao Chen', 'Xing Zeng', 'Ruitao Zhang', 'Jiaoti Huang', 'Xiangxing Kuang', 'Jun Yang', 'Jihong Liu', 'Ossama Tawfik', 'James Brantley Thrasher', 'Benyi Li']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Calcium channel blockers and prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptor-dependent regulation of Bcl-xL expression: Implication in prostate cancer progression.', 'Peroxiredoxin 2 in the nucleus and cytoplasm distinctly regulates androgen receptor activity in prostate cancer cells.', 'c-Jun enhancement of androgen receptor transactivation is associated with prostate cancer cell proliferation.', 'Molecular regulation of androgen action in prostate cancer.', 'De novo CACNA1D Ca2+ channelopathies: clinical phenotypes and molecular mechanism.', 'Calcium signalling pathways in prostate cancer initiation and progression.', 'CACNA1D overexpression and voltage-gated calcium channels in prostate cancer during androgen deprivation.', 'The Role οf Ion Channels in the Development and Progression of Prostate Cancer.', 'Alterations in the Ca2+ toolkit in oesophageal adenocarcinoma.', 'Calcium and calcium-related proteins in endometrial cancer: opportunities for pharmacological intervention.']"""

The aim of our study was to provide a clinically relevant and detailed assessment of survival following surgical excision in patients with RCC of all stages according to age, stage, and grade.  Materials and methods:   A retrospective population-based analysis of 42,090 patients in the United States who were treated with partial nephrectomy (PN) or radical nephrectomy (RN) for RCC of all stages between the years 1988 and 2008 was performed. Competing-risks Poisson regression analyses focusing on cancer-specific mortality (CSM) or other-cause mortality (OCM) were executed. Stratification was performed according to age groups (≤ 59, 60-69, 70-79, and ≥ 80 y), the American Joint Committee on Cancer stage (I, II, III, and IV), and the Fuhrman grade (I-II and III-IV).  Results:   Increasing stage was associated with higher CSM rates (from 2%-9% to 54%-79% for stage I and IV), regardless of age. Similarly, high tumor grade was associated with higher CSM rates (from 2%-64% to 6%-79% for low and high grade). However, OCM was nonnegligible amongst persons aged 70 to 79 years (11%-24%) and ≥ 80 years (17%-44%), regardless of stage and grade. In subanalyses focusing on stage I RCC, CSM (3%-10%) rates were slightly higher for RN-treated patients, regardless of age and grade. However, in individuals aged 70 to 79 years with high-grade RCC, OCM rates were slightly higher for PN relative to RN (25.5% vs. 23.5%). In those aged ≥ 80 years, OCM rates were higher for PN compared with RN, both for low-grade (39.4% vs. 32.7%) and high-grade disease (52.0% vs. 42.8%).  Conclusions:   Tumor grade and American Joint Committee on Cancer stage represent important prognostic factors for the prediction of CSM, despite adjustment for patient age.

Comparing expression (mRNA) of many fatigue-related genes in patients with ADT-treated prostate cancer versus with CFS versus healthy controls, and correlating mRNA with fatigue severity may clarify the differing pathways underlying fatigue in these conditions.  Methods:   Quantitative real-time PCR was performed on leukocytes from 30 fatigued, ADT-treated prostate cancer patients (PCF), 39 patients with CFS and 22 controls aged 40-79, together with ratings of fatigue and pain severity. 46 genes from these pathways were included: (1) adrenergic/monoamine/neuropeptides, (2) immune, (3) metabolite-detecting, (4) mitochondrial/energy, (5) transcription factors.  Results:   PCF patients showed higher expression than controls or CFS of 2 immune transcription genes (NR3C1 and TLR4), chemokine CXCR4, and mitochondrial gene SOD2. They showed lower expression of 2 vasodilation-related genes (ADRB2 and VIPR2), 2 cytokines (TNF and LTA), and 2 metabolite-detecting receptors (ASIC3 and P2RX7). CFS patients showed higher P2RX7 and lower HSPA2 versus controls and PCF. Correlations with fatigue severity were similar in PCF and CFS for only DBI, the GABA-A receptor modulator (r=-0.50, p<0.005 and r=-0.34, p<0.05). Purinergic P2RY1 was correlated only with PCF fatigue and pain severity (r=+0.43 and +0.59, p=0.025 and p=0.001).

To assess the impact of phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor (PDE5i) use on penile length changes.  Patients and methods:   Men undergoing RP were enrolled in this prospective study before surgery. Demographic, clinical and PDE5i frequency-of-use data were collected. Erectile function was measured using the erectile function domain (EFD) of the International Index of Erectile Function. A single evaluator measured stretched flaccid penile length (SFPL) before RP, and at 2 and 6 months after RP. Repeated measures analysis was used to test differences in SFPL between timepoints. Pearson correlation was used for univariate analyses and multiple regression was used for multivariable analysis.  Results:   A total of 118 patients were evaluated at baseline, with 76 and 63 patients evaluated at 2 and 6 months, respectively. At 2 months, there was a 2.4-mm mean decrease in SFPL, while at 6 months there was no significant difference. At 6 months, those subjects who took a daily PDE5i had no SFPL loss (n = 36, 1±6.7 mm gain, P = 0.37 compared with baseline), while those subjects who did not consistently take a PDE5i had SFPL loss (n = 27, 4.4±6.6 mm loss, P < 0.002 compared with baseline).

Patients and methods:   From January 2009 to March 2012, patients with localized PCa who refused active surveillance were assigned to a FC protocol. This was a prospective, single-arm cohort study. Inclusion criteria were: unilateral disease, clinical stage T1c to T2a, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) concentration <10 ng/mL, low volume index lesion and Gleason score ≤6 (3+3). Hemi-ablation was carried out using the Precise(TM) cryoablation system (Galil Medical, Inc., Arden Hills, MN, USA). Oncological (PSA values) and functional (International Prostate Symptom Score and International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF)-5 score) outcomes were analysed at 3-, 6- and 12-month follow-up. The primary endpoint for oncological efficacy, no cancer in ipsilateral side, was based on the 12-month mandatory biopsy.  Results:   A total of 48 consecutive patients with a mean age of 67 years were included. The median (interquartile range) follow-up was 13.2 (7.4-26.5) months. Follow-up prostate biopsies were negative for the treated lobe in 86% of patients. The mean PSA concentration dropped significantly at 3 months (by 55%) but did not correlate well with positive biopsy results. Urinary symptoms were unchanged. A slight decrease in the IIEF-5 score was present at 3 months, but did not differ significantly from baseline at 6-month follow-up. There were 15% grade 1 and 4% grade 2 complications (Clavien classification).  Conclusions:   Focal cryoablation is a low-morbidity option in selected patients with low-risk PCa. We showed PSA concentration to be an unreliable marker for monitoring FC and recommend a protocol of mandatory biopsies for follow-up.

Contraindications for ON were impaired renal function (serum creatinine >2 mg/dL), chronic inflammatory bowel disease, previous bowel resection and tumour involvement at the bladder neck/prostatic urethra. Patients who did not have these contraindications chose to undergo either IC or ONB reconstruction, after impartial counselling. Baseline characteristics, including demographic profile, body mass index, comorbidities, histopathology of the cystoprostatectomy (with lymph nodes) specimen, pathological tumour stage, postoperative complications, adjuvant therapy and relapse, were recorded and compared.

Many studies have addressed the predominant colonizer of sebaceous follicles of the skin, Propionibacterium acnes, and investigated its association with the skin disorder acne vulgaris, and lately with prostate cancer. Much less is known about two other propionibacterial species frequently found on human tissue sites, Propionibacterium granulosum and Propionibacterium avidum. Here we analyzed two and three genomes of P. granulosum and P. avidum, respectively, and compared them to two genomes of P. acnes; we further highlight differences among the three cutaneous species with proteomic and microscopy approaches.  Results:   Electron and atomic force microscopy revealed an exopolysaccharide (EPS)-like structure surrounding P. avidum cells, that is absent in P. acnes and P. granulosum. In contrast, P. granulosum possesses pili-like appendices, which was confirmed by surface proteome analysis. The corresponding genes were identified; they are clustered with genes encoding sortases. Both, P. granulosum and P. avidum lack surface or secreted proteins for predicted host-interacting factors of P. acnes, including several CAMP factors, sialidases, dermatan-sulphate adhesins, hyaluronidase and a SH3 domain-containing lipoprotein; accordingly, only P. acnes exhibits neuraminidase and hyaluronidase activities. These functions are encoded on previously unrecognized island-like regions in the genome of P. acnes.  Conclusions:   Despite their omnipresence on human skin little is known about the role of cutaneous propionibacteria. All three species are associated with a variety of diseases, including postoperative and device-related abscesses and infections. We showed that the three organisms have evolved distinct features to interact with their human host. Whereas P. avidum and P. granulosum produce an EPS-like surface structure and pili-like appendices, respectively, P. acnes possesses a number of unique surface-exposed proteins with host-interacting properties. The different surface properties of the three cutaneous propionibacteria are likely to determine their colonizing ability and pathogenic potential on the skin and at non-skin sites.""","""['Tim N Mak', 'Monika Schmid', 'Elzbieta Brzuszkiewicz', 'Guanghong Zeng', 'Rikke Meyer', 'Karen S Sfanos', 'Volker Brinkmann', 'Thomas F Meyer', 'Holger Brüggemann']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""BMC Genomics""","""['Porphyrin Production and Regulation in Cutaneous Propionibacteria.', 'Production of hyaluronidase by propionibacteria from different origins.', 'Effects of pH on biomass, maximum specific growth rate and extracellular enzyme production by three species of cutaneous propionibacteria grown in continuous culture.', 'Unravelling the eco-specificity and pathophysiological properties of Cutibacterium species in the light of recent taxonomic changes.', 'Clinical and Biological Features of Cutibacterium (Formerly Propionibacterium) avidum, an Underrecognized Microorganism.', 'Acne conglobata caused by Cutibacterium avidum.', 'Solution Structure of the Cutibacterium acnes-Specific Protein RoxP and Insights Into Its Antioxidant Activity.', 'Anatomy promotes neutral coexistence of strains in the human skin microbiome.', 'Prostate Microbiota and Prostate Cancer: A New Trend in Treatment.', 'A Janus-Faced Bacterium: Host-Beneficial and -Detrimental Roles of Cutibacterium acnes.']"""

Results:   The median age of patients in the CRPC group was 74 years, and the median prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level at the time of the urodynamic study was 90 ng/mL. According to the BOO index, three patients (14%) were obstructed, three were equivocally obstructed (14%) and 15 were unobstructed. DO was seen in 12 patients (57%).

Conclusions:   This study generates the hypothesis that only a minority of CRPC patients with LUTS have BOO, and that more than half of patients have DO. LUTS in CRPC may therefore be seldom attributable to BOO, but are, at least in part, related to DO and reduced cystometric capacity.

Patients and methods:   We evaluated BCR-free survival in men with LN metastases after RP and pelvic LN dissection performed in six high-volume centres. Multivariable Cox regression tested the role of ENE and diameter of largest LN metastasis in predicting eBCR after adjusting for clinicopathological variables. We compared the discrimination of multivariable models including ENE, the size of largest LN metastasis and the number of positive LNs.  Results:   Overall, 484 patients were included. The median (interquartile range, IQR) follow-up was 16.1 (6-27.5) months. The median (IQR) number of removed LNs was 10 (4-14), and the median (IQR) number of positive LNs was 1 (1-2). ENE was present in 280 (58%) patients, and 211 (44%) had their largest metastasis >10 mm. Patients with ENE and/or largest metastasis of >10 mm had significantly worse eBCR-free survival (all P < 0.01). On multivariable analysis, number of positive LNs (≤2 vs >2) and the diameter of LN metastasis (≤10 vs >10 mm), but not ENE, were significant predictors of eBCR (all P < 0.003).

To determine the most appropriate estimation method for current clinical practice.  Patients and methods:   Radical prostatectomy (RP) specimens from multiple institutions were analysed by a single uro-pathologist between September 2009 and May 2011. Tumour properties including thickness, width and length were collected and TV was established using computer-assisted image analysis (CAIA). TV estimation methods including; square, cuboidal and ellipsoidal estimations were calculated using previously reported formulae. The estimation methods were compared against the 'gold-standard' and the accuracy of identifying clinically significant tumours of TV ≥0.5 cc was determined.  Results:   In all, 299 consecutive specimens were analysed by a single uropathologist. The median index TV on CAIA was 1.42 cc. Of the four estimation methods, the ellipsoid methods produced the closest correlation with the gold-standard (r(2) 0.91, P = 0.71). This correlation lost accuracy when larger tumours (TV >4 cc) were excluded from the analysis (r(2) = 0.73, P = 0.003). Sensitivity and specificity for identifying clinically significant tumours was 94% and 92% respectively, when using the ellipsoid estimation.  Conclusions:   In current uro-pathology, the ellipsoidal estimation method appears to be the most suitable for estimating TV in prostate cancers. This method is cheap, reproducible and sensitive and can be safely used as a surrogate for CAIA volumes when such technology is not available.""","""['Marlon Perera', 'Nathan Lawrentschuk', 'Damien Bolton', 'David Clouston']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Tumour volume is an independent predictor of prostate-specific antigen recurrence in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy for clinically localized prostate cancer.', 'Tumor volume in radical prostatectomy specimens assessed by digital image analysis software correlates with other prognostic factors.', 'The ability of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) density to predict an upgrade in Gleason score between initial prostate biopsy and prostatectomy diminishes with increasing tumour grade due to reduced PSA secretion per unit tumour volume.', 'Gleason grading of prostate cancer in needle biopsies or radical prostatectomy specimens: contemporary approach, current clinical significance and sources of pathology discrepancies.', 'Prognostic significance of tumor volume in radical prostatectomy and needle biopsy specimens.', 'Machine learning-based analysis of a semi-automated PI-RADS v2.1 scoring for prostate cancer.', 'Comparison of malignancy and spatial distribution between latent and clinical prostate cancer: an 8-year biopsy study.', 'Histological characteristics of the largest and secondary tumors in radical prostatectomy specimens and implications for focal therapy.', 'The transverse and vertical distribution of prostate cancer in biopsy and radical prostatectomy specimens.', 'Measurement of tumor volume is not superior to diameter for prediction of lymph node metastasis in early gastric cancer with minute submucosal invasion.']"""

Patients and methods:   In the period from February 2011 to June 2012, 127 consecutive patients were included in the study. We used a Hitachi Preirus with Hi-RTE module, a prostate end-fire transrectal probe was used for RTE and for targeted biopsies, and a simultaneous biplane probe was used for the standard systematic biopsies. The peripheral zone of the prostate was divided into six regions, and each biopsy obtained was referred to a specific region. All patients were first examined with RTE and, if cancer was suspected, targeted biopsies were taken. A standard systematic 10-core biopsy was then taken in all patients.  Results:   In all, 64 (50%) patients were diagnosed with prostate cancer in the initial biopsy setting. Three patients were diagnosed solely on RTE-targeted biopsies, 31 were found only in systematic biopsies, and 30 were correctly diagnosed with both methods. In the RTE-positive group there was a significantly higher frequency of positive cores, a lower prostate volume, a higher Gleason score, and a higher fraction of cancer tissue in each core. In a multiple regression model RTE was an independent marker for high-risk cancer. The sensitivity of 42% for all prostate cancers increased to 60% for high-grade prostate cancers. Similarly, the negative predictive value increased from 79% to 97%. An additional eight patients were diagnosed with prostate cancer during the study period.

Clinical and oncological data from men with localised prostate adenocarcinoma were also assessed and compared with RHAMM expression data.  Patients and methods:   Data from 367 men who underwent histological evaluation of the prostate were retrospectively evaluated under six conditions: (i) benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), (ii) BPH treated with finasteride, (iii) prostate cancer without ADT, (iv) prostate cancer treated with neoadjuvant ADT before prostatectomy (cyproterone 200 mg/day), (v) castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), and (vi) normal peritumoral prostate tissue. Tissue microarrays were constructed and 1354 cores were evaluated for immunohistochemical RHAMM expression.  Results:   There was no RHAMM expression in any tissue from normal patients or those with BPH or prostate cancer without ADT. There was RHAMM expression in 39.4% of prostate cancer tissues treated with ADT and in 46.2% of CRPC samples (P = 0.001). There was a significant increase in RHAMM expression with increased ADT duration in group 4, with a marked increase in RHAMM expression after 6-12 months of ADT (P = 0.04). No prognostic or clinical factors related to prostate cancer were associated with RHAMM expression.  Conclusions:   RHAMM expression in prostate cancer is directly associated with ADT. Significant RHAMM expression occurs as early as after 1 month of ADT and progressively increases with ADT duration. When prostate cancer becomes CRPC, RHAMM expression is higher. RHAMM expression was not associated with prostate cancer prognostic factors.

Purpose of this work is to study clinical and dosimetric parameters impacting on late GI toxicity after prostate external beam radiotherapy (RT) and to establish multivariate normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) model for radiation-induced GI complications.  Methods:   A total of 57 men who had undergone definitive RT for prostate cancer were evaluated for GI events classified using the RTOG/EORTC scoring system. Their median age was 73 years (range 53-85). The patients were assessed for GI toxicity before, during, and periodically after RT completion. Several clinical variables along with rectum dose-volume parameters (Vx) were collected and their correlation to GI toxicity was analyzed by Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (Rs). Multivariate logistic regression method using resampling techniques was applied to select model order and parameters for NTCP modeling. Model performance was evaluated through the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).  Results:   At a median follow-up of 30 months, 37% (21/57) patients developed G1-2 acute GI events while 33% (19/57) were diagnosed with G1-2 late GI events. An NTCP model for late mild/moderate GI toxicity based on three variables including V65 (OR = 1.03), antihypertensive and/or anticoagulant (AH/AC) drugs (OR = 0.24), and acute GI toxicity (OR = 4.3) was selected as the most predictive model (Rs = 0.47, p < 0.001; AUC = 0.79). This three-variable model outperforms the logistic model based on V65 only (Rs = 0.28, p < 0.001; AUC = 0.69).  Conclusions:   We propose a logistic NTCP model for late GI toxicity considering not only rectal irradiation dose but also clinical patient-specific factors. Accordingly, the risk of G1-2 late GI increases as V65 increases, it is higher for patients experiencing previous acute toxicity and it is lower for patients who take AH/AC drugs.

Patients and methods:   We examined the data of 595 men treated with RP for non-metastatic high-risk prostate cancer between 1992 and 2011 at two European tertiary care centres. Kaplan-Meier analyses were used to graphically depict 2-year BCR-free survival. Multivariable Cox regression models addressed early BCR. We tested whether addition of %TV and %HGTV to a multivariable Cox regression model helps to increase a model's predictive accuracy (PA) for prediction of early BCR.  Results:   In all, 32 men (10%) with specimen-confined prostate cancer (pT2-pT3a, negative surgical margin, pN0) and 67 men (24%) with non-specimen-confined prostate cancer had early BCR. After stratification according to %HGTV (%HGTV threshold: ≤33.33 vs >33.33%), the 2-year BCR-free survival rates were respectively 93 vs 60% (log-rank P < 0.001). In multivariable Cox regression models %HGTV emerged as an independent predictor of early BCR (P < 0.001), whereas %TV did not (P > 0.05). However, adding %HGTV (regardless of its coding) to other covariates in multivariable Cox regression analysis did not increase the model's PA in a meaningful fashion compared with the use of the detailed Gleason grading system (6 vs 7a vs 7b vs 8 vs 9-10).  Conclusions:   In a large cohort of patients with high-risk prostate cancer, %HGTV and %TV did not improve prediction of early BCR after RP substantially, although %HGTV was an independent predictor of early BCR. Therefore, sophisticated TV/HGTV measurements do not seem to have additional benefit for early BCR prediction relative to the use of Gleason grading.

All patients underwent preoperative MRI, including T2-weighted, diffusion-weighted, and dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging, as well as radical prostatectomy (RP) between June 2005 and December 2011. Imaging results were correlated with pathological findings to evaluate the ability of MRI to select patients for AS.  Results:   In 35 (11.7%) patients, no discrete cancer was visible on MRI, while in the remaining 263 (88.3%) patients, a discrete cancer was visible.

Operative time assessment is inherent to defining surgeon learning curves and evaluating quality of care.  Subjects/patients and methods:   Population-based observational cohort study using USA Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare linked data of men diagnosed with prostate cancer during 2003-2007 who underwent robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP, 3458 men) and retropubic RP (RRP, 6993) through to 2009. We obtained median operative time using anaesthesia administrative data for RP and used median regression to assess the contribution of patient, surgeon, and hospital factors to operative times.  Results:   The median RARP operative time decreased from 315 to 247 min from 2003 to 2008-2009 (P < 0.001), while the median RRP operative time remained similar (195 vs 197 min, P = 0.90).

Methods:   We investigated CRPC by analysing compounds in phase I to phase III clinical trials between 1998 and April 2011. Drug development failures were classified as medical or commercial and were compared with industry expectations. Compounds were excluded from analysis if their phase I occurred before 1998, if they targeted patients that were did not have hormone-refractory prostate cancer, or if they did not assess outcomes such as overall survival, time to disease progression, or prostate-specific antigen levels.  Results:   Thorough searches of clinicaltrial.gov and other databases yielded 77 compounds that met the inclusion criteria. The cumulative pass rate for first-line compounds in CRPC was 3% and was far below aggregate industry expectations. In total, there were nearly equivalent numbers of commercial and medical failures. Biological products were found to have had greater relative success than small-molecule drugs and biotechnology firms had been slightly more successful than pharmaceutical firms in this disease indication. Phase III failures were high, despite equally high failures during phase II.  Conclusions:   Currently, one in 33 compounds that enters clinical testing will be awarded US Food and Drug Administration approval. This appears to be the highest risk indication investigated to date, based on clinical trial studies alone, with an average cost of $1.411bn to bring a new drug to market when adjusted for risk.

The Victorian cancer registry was used to obtain Gleason scores. Age-standardized and age-specific rates were calculated, along with the incidence of PCa, and correlated with Gleason scores.  Results:   A total 5 174 031 PSA tests detected 128 167 PCas in the period 2001-2008.

This is the first report showing that S100A4 is not merely a metastatic protein but also an oncoprotein that plays a critical role in the development of tumors. We earlier showed that S100A4 expression progressively increases in prostatic tissues with the advancement of prostate cancer (CaP) in TRAMP, an autochthonous mouse model. To study the functional significance of S100A4 in CaP, we generated a heterozygously deleted S100A4 (TRAMP/S100A4(+/-)) genotype by crossing TRAMP with S100A4(-/-) mice. TRAMP/S100A4(+/-) did not show a lethal phenotype, and transgenes were functional. As compared to age-matched TRAMP littermates, TRAMP/S100A4(+/-) mice exhibited 1) an increased tumor latency period (P < 0.001), 2) a 0% incidence of metastasis, and 3) reduced prostatic weights (P < 0.001). We generated S100A4-positive clones from S100A4-negative CaP cells and tested their potential. S100A4-positive tumors grew at a faster rate than S100A4-negative tumors in vitro and in a xenograft mouse model. The S100A4 protein exhibited growth factor-like properties in multimode (intracellular and extracellular) forms. We observed that 1) the growth-promoting effect of S100A4 is due to its activation of NFκB, 2) S100A4-deficient tumors exhibit reduced NFκB activity, 3) S100A4 regulates NFκB through the RAGE receptor, and 4) S100A4 and RAGE co-localize in prostatic tissues of mice.

Castration is commonly used to treat prostate cancer. Although the disease initially responds to androgen blockade strategies, it often becomes castration-resistant (CRPC for Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer). Most of the murine models of mixed lesions derived from prostate cancer cells are androgen sensitive. Thus, we established a new model of CRPC (androgen receptor (AR) negative) that causes mixed lesions in bone.  Methods:   PC3 and its derived new cell clone PC3c cells were directly injected into the tibiae of SCID male mice. Tumor growth was analyzed by radiography and histology. Direct effects of conditioned medium of both cell lines were tested on osteoclasts, osteoblasts and osteocytes.  Results:   We found that PC3c cells induced mixed lesions 10 weeks after intratibial injection. In vitro, PC3c conditioned medium was able to stimulate tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP)-positive osteoclasts. Osteoprotegerin (OPG) and endothelin-1 (ET1) were highly expressed by PC3c while dikkopf-1 (DKK1) expression was decreased. Finally, PC3c highly expressed bone associated markers osteopontin (OPN), Runx2, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), bone sialoprotein (BSP) and produced mineralized matrix in vitro in osteogenic conditions.  Conclusions:   We have established a new CRPC cell line as a useful system for modeling human metastatic prostate cancer which presents the mixed phenotype of bone metastases that is commonly observed in prostate cancer patients with advanced disease. This model will help to understand androgen-independent mechanisms involved in the progression of prostate cancer in bone and provides a preclinical model for testing the effects of new treatments for bone metastases.""","""['Anaïs Fradet', 'Hélène Sorel', 'Baptiste Depalle', 'Claire Marie Serre', 'Delphine Farlay', 'Andrei Turtoi', 'Akeila Bellahcene', 'Hélène Follet', 'Vincent Castronovo', 'Philippe Clézardin', 'Edith Bonnelye']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Bone Cell Activity in Clinical Prostate Cancer Bone Metastasis and Its Inverse Relation to Tumor Cell Androgen Receptor Activity.', 'A novel patient-derived intra-femoral xenograft model of bone metastatic prostate cancer that recapitulates mixed osteolytic and osteoblastic lesions.', 'Osteoblasts stimulate the osteogenic and metastatic progression of castration-resistant prostate cancer in a novel model for in vitro and in vivo studies.', 'Bone-targeting agents in prostate cancer.', 'Animal models of bone metastasis.', 'Nano-Hydroxyapatite/PLGA Mixed Scaffolds as a Tool for Drug Development and to Study Metastatic Prostate Cancer in the Bone.', 'SFRP2 Overexpression Induces an Osteoblast-like Phenotype in Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Targeting the BMP Pathway in Prostate Cancer Induced Bone Disease.', 'Use of FVB Myc-CaP cells as an immune competent, androgen receptor positive, mouse model of prostate cancer bone metastasis.', 'Prostate Cancer Cell Extracellular Vesicles Increase Mineralisation of Bone Osteoblast Precursor Cells in an In Vitro Model.']"""

Methods:   We searched PubMed, EMBASE, and MEDLINE database for case-control and cohort studies that assessed the association of dietary cadmium intake and cancer risk. We performed a meta-analysis using eight eligible studies to summarize the data and summary relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using a random effects model.  Results:   Overall, dietary cadmium intake showed no statistically significant association with cancer risk (RR = 1.10; 95% CI: 0.99-1.22, for highest vs. lowest dietary cadmium group). However, there was strong evidence of heterogeneity, and subgroup analyses were conducted using the study design, geographical location, and cancer type. In subgroup analyses, the positive associations between dietary cadmium intake and cancer risk were observed among studies with Western populations (RR = 1.15; 95% CI: 1.08-1.23) and studies investigating some hormone-related cancers (prostate, breast, and endometrial cancers).  Conclusion:   Our analysis found a positive association between dietary cadmium intake and cancer risk among studies conducted in Western countries, particularly with hormone-related cancers. Additional experimental and epidemiological studies are required to verify our findings.""","""['Young Ae Cho', 'Jeongseon Kim', 'Hae Dong Woo', 'Moonsu Kang']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Dietary exposure to cadmium and risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal women: A systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Associations between dietary patterns and the risk of breast cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies.', 'Association between dietary cadmium exposure and breast cancer risk: an updated meta-analysis of observational studies.', 'Cadmium exposure and risk of breast cancer: A dose-response meta-analysis of cohort studies.', 'Association between dietary nitrate and nitrite intake and sitespecific cancer risk: evidence from observational studies.', 'Cadmium exposure and risk of breast cancer: A meta-analysis.', 'Drivers of cadmium accumulation in Theobroma cacao L. beans: A quantitative synthesis of soil-plant relationships across the Cacao Belt.', 'Exposure to airborne cadmium and breast cancer stage, grade and histology at diagnosis: findings from the E3N cohort study.', 'A Narrative Review of the Role of Diet and Lifestyle Factors in the Development and Prevention of Endometrial Cancer.', 'Developmental toxicity of cadmium in infants and children: a review.']"""

Here, we found that RD induced cell cycle arrest in G2/M phase in PC-3 cells, and caused remarkable DNA damage as evidenced by induction of γH2AX foci, micronuclei, and DNA fragmentation in Comet assay. Time kinetic and dose-dependent studies showed that ATM/Chk2 and ATR/Chk1 signaling pathways were sequentially activated in response to RD. Blockage of ATM/ATR signaling led to the attenuation of RD-induced γH2AX, and to the partial recovery of cell proliferation. Furthermore, RD exposure resulted in the inactivation of BRCA1, suppression of HR and NHEJ repair activity, and downregulation of the expressions and DNA-end binding activities of Ku70/86. Consistent with the observations, microarray data displayed that RD triggered the changes in genes responsible for cell proliferation, cell cycle, DNA damage and repair, and apoptosis. Administration of RD to xenograft mice reduced tumor growth, and coordinately caused alterations in the expression of genes involved in DNA damage and repair, along with cell apoptosis. Thus, this finding identified a novel mechanism by which RD affects DNA repair and acts as a DNA damage agent in prostate cancer.""","""['Zhongyi Hu', 'Feng Kong', 'Manfei Si', 'Keli Tian', 'Lin Xi Yu', 'Charles Y F Young', 'Huiqing Yuan', 'Hongxiang Lou']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Induction of DNA damage and p21-dependent senescence by Riccardin D is a novel mechanism contributing to its growth suppression in prostate cancer cells in vitro and in vivo.', 'Galiellalactone induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis through the ATM/ATR pathway in prostate cancer cells.', 'Inhibitory effect of riccardin D on growth of human non-small cell lung cancer: in vitro and in vivo studies.', 'The ATM-Chk2 and ATR-Chk1 pathways in DNA damage signaling and cancer.', 'DNA damage checkpoint kinases in cancer.', 'Natural Compounds as Anticancer Agents Targeting DNA Topoisomerases.', 'Synthesis, characterization and DNA interaction studies of new triptycene derivatives.']"""

Treatment options are limited and in order to develop more targeted therapies, improved understanding of the complex mechanisms that lead to bone lesion development are warranted. Interestingly, whilst prostate-derived bone metastases are characterised by mixed or osteoblastic lesions, breast-derived bone metastases are characterised by osteolytic lesions, suggesting unique regulatory patterns. This study aimed to measure the changes in bone formation and bone resorption activity at two time-points (18 and 36 days) during development of the bone lesion following intratibial injection of MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells into the left tibiae of Severely Combined Immuno-Deficient (SCID) mice. The contralateral tibia was used as a control. Tibiae were extracted and processed for undecalcified histomorphometric analysis. We provide evidence that the early bone loss observed following exposure to MDA-MB-231 cells was due to a significant reduction in mineral apposition rate, rather than increased levels of bone resorption. This suggests that osteoblast activity was impaired in the presence of breast cancer cells, contrary to previous reports of osteoclast-dependent bone loss. Furthermore mRNA expression of Dickkopf Homolog 1 (DKK-1) and Noggin were confirmed in the MDA-MB-231 cell line, both of which antagonise osteoblast regulatory pathways. The observed bone loss following injection of cancer cells was due to an overall thinning of the trabecular bone struts rather than perforation of the bone tissue matrix (as measured by trabecular width and trabecular separation, respectively), suggesting an opportunity to reverse the cancer-induced bone changes. These novel insights into the mechanisms through which osteolytic bone lesions develop may be important in the development of new treatment strategies for metastatic breast cancer patients.""","""['Laura S Gregory', 'Wilson Choi', 'Leslie Burke', 'Judith A Clements']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Mixed metastatic lung cancer lesions in bone are inhibited by noggin overexpression and Rank:Fc administration.', 'Prostate cancer cells promote osteoblastic bone metastases through Wnts.', 'Lack of noggin expression by cancer cells is a determinant of the osteoblast response in bone metastases.', 'Parathyroid hormone-related protein and bone metastases.', 'Basic mechanisms responsible for osteolytic and osteoblastic bone metastases.', 'Morpholino-driven blockade of Dkk-1 in osteosarcoma inhibits bone damage and tumour expansion by multiple mechanisms.', 'Osteoblasts are ""educated"" by crosstalk with metastatic breast cancer cells in the bone tumor microenvironment.', 'PTH1R-CaSR Cross Talk: New Treatment Options for Breast Cancer Osteolytic Bone Metastases.', 'Sclerostin: an Emerging Target for the Treatment of Cancer-Induced Bone Disease.', 'Intra-iliac Artery Injection for Efficient and Selective Modeling of Microscopic Bone Metastasis.']"""

Methods:   Data from 1268 patients undergoing radical prostatectomy between 2000 and 2009 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were classified according to whether they were of age <70 or ≥70 years at radical prostatectomy. Patient characteristics, pathological and oncological outcomes were compared among the groups.  Results:   Of the total population, 31.4% (398 of 1268) of patients were ≥70 years of age. The median age in patients <70 and ≥70 years of age was 64 (45-69) and 72 (70-83) years. The proportion of low-risk disease was significantly lower among those ≥70 years of age than in those <70 years, while the proportion of high-risk disease was significantly higher among those ≥70 years of age than in those <70 years (P < 0.001). The proportions of pathological high-risk disease (≥T3b, GS ≥8, positive surgical margin or lymph node invasion) in patients <70 and ≥70 years of age were 42.0 and 50.0%, respectively (P = 0.008).

We tried to investigate the distribution of bone metastases in common cancers using bone scintigraphy.  Material and methods:   160 consecutive patients with malignancy (prostate cancer: 32, breast cancer: 107, lung cancer:8, and gastrointestinal cancers: 13) underwent bone scan.  Results:   From the 160 patients, 58 patients (36.3%) had abnormal bone scans attributable to metastatic tumor. Bone metastases were found in 32.7%, 40.6%, 38.5% and 62.5% of patients with breast, prostate, GI and lung cancers, respectively (P = 0.35). The most frequently involved area was the spine, followed by ribs and pelvic bones. Spine was the most frequent site of bone metastases in breast and GI cancers. Except for the spine, common locations of bone metastases from breast cancer were ribs and sternum. In prostate cancer, the most frequent site were spine and pelvis, with similar incidences. In lung cancer, ribs followed by spine were most frequent sites of bone metastases. 97 (60.6%) of the cancer patients studied had symptoms of bone pain. The highest incidence was associated with metastatic lesions in bone scan (P = 0.004). Significant correlation between location of bone pain and evidence of bone metastasis in the same region was noticed in the pelvis (P =0.001), skull (P = 0.04), sternum (P = 0.01), spine (P = 0.003) and femur (P < 0.001).  Conclusions:   Our results indicate that the spine and pelvis in prostate carcinoma and the spine, ribs and sternum in breast carcinoma as well as ribs and spine in lung cancer are most frequently invaded.

Disruption of FoxO activity due to loss of phosphatase and tensin homolog and activation of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt are frequently observed in prostate cancer. Apigenin, a naturally occurring plant flavone, exhibits antiproliferative and anticarcinogenic activities through mechanisms, which are not fully defined. In the present study, we show that apigenin suppressed prostate tumorigenesis in transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate (TRAMP) mice through the PI3K/Akt/FoxO-signaling pathway. Apigenin-treated TRAMP mice (20 and 50 μg/mouse/day, 6 days/week for 20 weeks) exhibited significant decrease in tumor volumes of the prostate as well as completely abolished distant organ metastasis. Apigenin treatment resulted in significant decrease in the weight of genitourinary apparatus (P < 0.0001), dorsolateral (P < 0.0001) and ventral prostate (P < 0.028), compared with the control group. Apigenin-treated mice showed reduced phosphorylation of Akt (Ser473) and FoxO3a (Ser253), which correlated with its increased nuclear retention and decreased binding of FoxO3a with 14-3-3. These events lead to reduced proliferation as assessed by Ki-67 and cyclin D1, along with upregulation of FoxO-responsive proteins BIM and p27/Kip1. Complementing in vivo results, similar observations were noted in human prostate cancer LNCaP and PC-3 cells after apigenin treatment. Furthermore, binding of FoxO3a with p27/Kip1 was markedly increased after 10 and 20 μM apigenin treatment resulting in G0/G1-phase cell cycle arrest, which was consistent with the effects elicited by PI3K/Akt inhibitor, LY294002.

Here, the authors propose a general framework for repositioning drug by incorporating various functional information. The framework starts with the identification of differentially expressed gene sets under disease state and drug treatment. Then the disease and drug are associated by the overlap of these two gene sets via biological function. The authors provide two strategies to assess the functional overlap. In the first strategy, functional relevance are evaluated by leveraging genes' lethality information to reveal drug's potential of curing diseases. In the second strategy, biological process perturbation profiles are identified by mapping differentially expressed genes into pathways and gene ontology (GO) terms. Their associations are assessed and used to rank drugs' potential of curing diseases.

To this end, we quantified the major fatty acids (laurate, myristate, palmitate, stearate, oleate, linoleate) and phytosterols (campesterol, stigmasterol, β-sitosterol) in 20 commercially available saw palmetto supplements using GC-FID and GC-MS, respectively.

Depletion of endogenous SEPT9_i1 or the exogenous expression of N 25 fragment reduces nuclear HIF-1α levels accompanied by reciprocal accumulation of HIF-1α in the cytoplasm. Mechanistically, SEPT9_i1 binds to importin-α through N 25 depending on its bipartite nuclear localization signal, to scaffold the association between HIF-1α and importin-α, which leads to facilitating HIF-1α nuclear translocation.

We question the commonly used practice of applying selenium concentrations found in human blood to in vitro studies and evaluated the utility of biomarkers, e.g., glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPx1) and thioredoxin reductase 1 (TrxR1), to determine appropriate selenium levels for in vitro work. Furthermore, we investigated the effects of Se-methylselenocysteine (SeMSC) on prostate cancer cell migration and invasion. After excluding cytotoxicity, we demonstrated that prostate cancer cell lines respond differently to selenium treatment as observed through biomarker assessment. We found that the maximum levels of GPx1 activity and TrxR1 expression were reached at lower selenium concentrations in LNCaP compared to PC3 cells, and PC3 compared to DU145 cells. Therefore the use of selenium concentrations extrapolated from human studies for in vitro work may be applicable when further informed using a readout of selenium repletion including use of selenium responsive biomarkers. No effect on PC3 migration or invasion was observed after long term SeMSC treatment; however a slight increase was found when treatment was solely administered during the assay. The opposite could be observed when cells were cultured under low serum conditions, with a significant increase in migration upon long term but not upon acute SeMSC treatment. To conclude, these findings indicate that it is imperative to study the selenium sensitivity of an in vitro model preferably using biomarkers before investigating any effects on biological processes, or before comparing models.""","""['Wouter Hendrickx', 'Julie Decock', 'Francis Mulholland', 'Yongping Bao', 'Susan Fairweather-Tait']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Front Oncol""","""['A selenium-deficient Caco-2 cell model for assessing differential incorporation of chemical or food selenium into glutathione peroxidase.', 'The von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor-suppressor gene is down-regulated by selenium deficiency in Caco-2 cells and rat colon mucosa.', 'Effect of selenium sources on the expression of cellular glutathione peroxidase and cytoplasmic thioredoxin reductase in the liver and kidney of broiler breeders and their offspring.', 'Selenium, selenoproteins and human health: a review.', 'Part of the series: from dietary antioxidants to regulators in cellular signaling and gene regulation.

DNA methylation in body fluids is a stable, easily detectable and promising PC biomarker. The major advantages of urine-based assays are their noninvasive nature and the ability to monitor PC with heterogeneous foci. The aim of this study was to determine the diagnostic value of the recently identified candidate PC biomarker HIST1H4K.  Methods:   We investigated DNA methylation of HIST1H4K in urine samples from 57 PC patients, 29 controls with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and 50 young asymptomatic men (YAM) by MethyLight real-time PCR.  Results:   The frequency of HIST1H4K promoter hypermethylation significantly discriminated PC patients from YAM (AUC =0.763; 95% CI 0.672-0.839; p<0.0001), but did not show any statistical difference between PC patients and BPH controls (AUC=0.513, 95% CI 0.402-0.622; p=0.8255). HIST1H4K could not outperform the prostatic specific antigen (PSA) in our sample (AUC=0.785; 95% CI 0.679-0.870; p<0.0001). Methylation of HIST1H4K showed significant correlation with aging (r=0.5418; p<0.0001), but with no other clinicopathological characteristics.  Conclusion:   The results suggest that the promoter hypermethylation of HIST1H4K is rather due to aging than related to prostate carcinogenesis.

Methods:   A survey was conducted among a volunteer sample of 1001 men with prostate cancer living in seven European countries.  Results:   At the time of the survey, 81% of the men had some unmet supportive care needs including psychological, sexual and health system and information needs. Logistic regression indicated that lack of post-treatment nursing care significantly predicted unmet need. Critically, men's contact with nurses and/or receipt of advice and support from nurses, for several different aspects of nursing care significantly had an impact on men's outcomes.

Methods:   nPSA and TnPSA were available for 410 patients. nPSA and TnPSA's impact on freedom from biochemical failure, freedom from metastasis, and prostate cancer-specific survival was assessed on univariate and multivariate analysis using Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards regression. Outcomes were also evaluated relative to the time since achieving nPSA and not relative to the time of RT, given the intrinsic time bias in TnPSA.  Results:   Median nPSA was 0.7 ng/mL (interquartile range: 0.4 to 1.1), with a median TnPSA of 25.0 months (IQR: 15.0 to 40.0). On univariate analysis both nPSA and TnPSA were predictive of all endpoints: freedom from biochemical failure, freedom from metastasis, and prostate cancer-specific survival, as categorical (all P<0.0001) and continuous (all P<0.01) variables. However, after adjusting for immortal-time bias the benefit of long TnPSA was mostly lost. On Cox proportional hazards, a TnPSA<12 months did have worse prognosis for biochemical failure and distant metastasis as compared with longer TnPSA, but for those who achieved nadir >12 months from the time of RT the TnPSA was no longer prognostic.

Furthermore, Wnt5a participates in the progression of several types of malignant tumor. This study investigates the role of Wnt5a in the migration of the prostate cancer (PCa) cell line PC3 toward bone marrow stromal cell (BMSC)‑conditioned medium (CM). The expression of 22 genes associated with bone metastasis was measured in three PCa cell lines (LNCaP, PC3 and DU145). Subsequently, the proliferation and migration capacities of PC3 cells treated either with small interfering RNA (siRNA) against Wnt5a or with recombinant mouse (rm) Wnt5a were analyzed with alamarBlue and transwell assays. BMSC‑CM was collected to evaluate its effect on PC3 cell migration. Also, the expression of Wnt5a in BMSCs was knocked down prior to collection of the CM to evaluate its effects on the migration of PC3 cells. Significantly higher levels of Wnt5a mRNA expression were identified in the PC3 cells, compared with those in LNCaP and DU145 cells. Silencing Wnt5a expression with siRNA reduced the migration capacity of PC3 cells by 50%. The addition of rmWnt5a improved the migration capacity of PC3 cells in a concentration‑dependent manner.

We studied impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and other markers of insulin-glucose metabolism in the Framingham Heart Study-Offspring Cohort, which uniquely tracks these markers and cancer >37 years.  Methods:   Participants were recruited between 1971 and 1975 and followed until 2008 (n = 4,615; mean age 66.8 years in 2008). Serum glucose, insulin, and hemoglobin A1c were determined from fasting blood in quart-annual exams. Lifestyle and demographic information was self-reported. HRs and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of cancer risk were computed using time-dependent survival analysis (SASv9.3), while accounting for temporal changes for relevant variables.  Results:   We identified 787 obesity-related cancers, including 136 colorectal, 217 breast, and 219 prostate cancers. Absence versus presence of IFG 10 to 20 years and 20+ years before the event or last follow-up was associated with 44% (95% CI, 1.15-1.79) and 57% (95% CI, 1.17-2.11) increased risk of obesity-related cancers, respectively. When time-dependent variables were used, after adjusting for age, sex, smoking, alcohol, and body mass index, IFG was associated with a 27% increased risk of obesity-related cancer (HR = 1.27; CI, 1.1-1.5). Associations were stronger in smokers (HR = 1.41; CI, 1.13-1.76). Increased risk was noted among persons with higher insulin (HR = 1.47; CI, 1.15-1.88) and hemoglobin A1c (HR = 1.54; CI, 1.13-2.10) for the highest (≥ 5.73%) versus lowest (≤ 5.25%) category. A >2-fold increase in colorectal cancer risk was observed for all blood biomarkers of insulin-glucose metabolism, particularly with earlier IFG exposure. Nonsignificant increased risk of breast and prostate cancer was observed for blood biomarkers.  Conclusions:   Earlier IFG exposure (>10 years before) increased obesity-related cancer risk, particularly for colorectal cancer.

In vitro studies were performed to analyze the degree of Ad infectivity after application of US-stimulated gene therapy. A luciferase-based Ad on a ubiquitous cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter (Ad5/3-CMV-Luc) was used in an animal model of prostate cancer (bilateral tumor growth) to evaluate Ad transduction efficiency after US-stimulated therapy. Bioluminescence imaging was employed for in vivo analysis to quantify Ad infection within the tumor. In vitro studies revealed no difference in Ad transduction between groups receiving US-stimulated therapy using high, low or sham US intensity exposures at various multiplicities of infection (MOIs) (p = 0.80). In vivo results indicated that tumors receiving US-stimulated therapy after intra-tumoral injection of Ad5/3-CMV-Luc (1 × 10(6) plaque-forming units) exhibited a 95.1% enhancement in tumor delivery compared with control tumors receiving sham US (p = 0.03).

Methods:   Visceral fat area (VFA) and periprostatic fat area (PPFA) were used as index of visceral obesity. In addition to VFA and PPFA, age, body mass index (BMI), prostate weight, cross-section area of Retzius space, history of previous abdominal surgery, repeated transrectal needle biopsy, and neoadjuvant hormone therapy were recorded. LRP was separated into 7 steps (1: port insertion and lymph node dissection, 2: endopelvic fascia incision, 3: dorsal vein complex ligation, 4: prostate dissection from bladder neck, 5: dissection of seminal vesicle and vas deferens, 6: prostate dissection from rectum, and 7: vesicourethral anastomosis). Potential factors that prolonged total operative time (OT), pneumoperitoneum time, and duration of each step were assessed by multivariate logistic regression analysis. The association between visceral obesity and other surgical outcomes was also evaluated.  Results:   One hundred sixteen LRPs were performed by a single experienced surgeon. High PPFA and prostate weight were independent factors that prolonged total OT and pneumoperitoneum time. High BMI was not a factor. PPFA affected steps 1, 4, 5, and 6, and prostate weight affected prolonged steps 5 and 6.

Although it is an important epidemiological tool allowing temporal or geographical comparisons, it cannot inform on the ""crude"" probability of death of cancer patients; i.e., when taking into account other possible causes of deaths.  Methods:   In this work, we provide estimates of the crude probabilities of death from cancer and from other causes as well as the probability of being alive up to ten years after cancer diagnosis according to the age and year of diagnosis. Based on a flexible excess hazard model providing unbiased estimates of net survival, our methodology avoids the pitfalls associated with the use of the cause of death. We used data from FRANCIM, the French network of cancer registries, and studied five common cancer sites: head and neck, breast, prostate, lung, and colorectal cancers.  Results:   For breast, prostate, and colorectal cancers, the impact of the other causes on the total probability of death increased with the age at diagnosis whereas it remained negligible for lung and head and neck cancers whatever the age. For breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer, the more recently was the cancer diagnosed, the less was the probability of death from cancer.

Myc is a transcription factor having a central function in stem cell biology and in human cancers. Hence, Myc represents an attractive target to develop CSC-specific therapies. Recent findings suggest that Myc transcription can be silenced using an RNA interference (RNAi)-based strategy that targets noncoding promoter-associated RNA (paRNA) overlapping the transcription start site. In this study, we investigated the effects of silencing Myc transcription on prostate CSC in cell culture and xenograft models of human prostate cancer. Treatment with an effective promoter-targeting siRNA reduced the fraction of CSCs, leading to reduced self-renewal, tumor-initiating, and metastatic capability. Combined analysis of stem-like cells and senescence markers indicated that Myc silencing triggered a phenotypic shift and senescence in the CSC subpopulation. Notably, systemic delivery of the promoter-targeting siRNA in the xenograft model produced a striking suppression in the development of prostate tumors. Our results support a pivotal role for Myc in CSC maintenance and show that Myc targeting via RNAi-based transcriptional silencing can trigger CSC senescence and loss of their tumor-initiating capability.

The aim of the present study was to determine the lncRNA expression profile in gastric cancer and its potential clinical value.  Methods:   The global lncRNA expression profile in gastric cancer was measured by lncRNA microarray. Levels of two representative lncRNAs, H19 and uc001lsz, were confirmed by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. The relationship between their levels and clinicopathological factors of patients with gastric cancer was explored. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was constructed for differentiating gastric cancer from benign gastric diseases.  Results:   Total of 135 lncRNAs, which differential expression levels between tumor and non-tumorous tissues were more than twofold, were found (GEO No. GSE47850). The most down-regulated lncRNAs in gastric cancer tissues were FER1L4, uc001lsz, BG491697, AF131784, uc009ycs, BG981369, AF147447, HMlincRNA1600, and AK054588; while the most up-regulated ones were H19, HMlincRNA717, BM709340, BQ213083, AK054978, and DB077273. H19 was found highly expressed in stomach and liver cancer cell lines, while lowly expressed in lung cancer and prostate cancer cell lines. Uc001lsz was lowly expressed in gastric, lung and liver cancer cell lines, while highly expressed in prostate cancer. The areas under ROC curves were up to 0.613, 0.751, and 0.761 for H19, uc001lsz, and the combination, respectively.  Conclusions:   The lncRNA expression profile in gastric cancer suggests the potential roles of lncRNAs in gastric cancer occurrence and development. The overexpression of H19 in gastric cancer suggests that H19 may be participated in gastric cancer. The reduced expression of uc001lsz in gastric cancer cell lines and tissues, its associations with TNM stage, and its dysregulation in early cancer and precancerous lesions suggest that uc001lsz may be a potential marker for the diagnosis of early gastric cancer.""","""['Haojun Song', 'Weiliang Sun', 'Guoliang Ye', 'Xiaoyun Ding', 'Zhong Liu', 'Sijie Zhang', 'Tian Xia', 'Bingxiu Xiao', 'Yang Xi', 'Junming Guo']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Transl Med""","""['Analysis of Long Non-Coding RNA Expression Profile and Functional Study of LOC389332 in Early Gastric Cancer.', 'Global expression profiling of metabolic pathway-related lncRNAs in human gastric cancer and the identification of RP11-555H23.1 as a new diagnostic biomarker.', 'H19 serves as a\xa0diagnostic biomarker and up-regulation of H19 expression contributes to poor prognosis in patients with gastric cancer.', 'Roles of long noncoding RNAs in gastric cancer and their clinical applications.', 'The Interplay of LncRNA-H19 and Its Binding Partners in Physiological Process and Gastric Carcinogenesis.', 'Chromatin and noncoding RNA-mediated mechanisms of gastric tumorigenesis.', 'Epigenetic regulation in myocardial infarction: Non-coding RNAs and exosomal non-coding RNAs.', 'A prognostic signature model for unveiling tumor progression in lung adenocarcinoma.', 'Long noncoding RNA ZNFX1-AS1 promotes the invasion and proliferation of gastric cancer cells by regulating LIN28 and CAPR1N1.', 'Curcumin against gastrointestinal cancer: A review of the pharmacological mechanisms underlying its antitumor activity.']"""

We hypothesized that mechanisms of peripheral tolerance dampen immune responses against mD52, thus limiting the protective effects of vaccination. To test this hypothesis, mice were depleted of CD25+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) and subcutaneously immunized with mD52 prior to a tumor challenge. The subcutaneous immunization failed to induce protective antitumor immunity unless accompanied by Treg depletion, which resulted in a rate of protection of 70% as compared with.""","""['Jennifer D Bright', 'Heather N Schultz', 'Jennifer A Byrne', 'Robert K Bright']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Oncoimmunology""","""['Overexpressed oncogenic tumor-self antigens.', 'Vaccination with metastasis-related tumor associated antigen TPD52 and CpG/ODN induces protective tumor immunity.', 'Memory and cellular immunity induced by a DNA vaccine encoding self antigen TPD52 administered with soluble GM-CSF.', 'Induction of tumorigenesis and metastasis by the murine orthologue of tumor protein D52.', 'Regulatory T cells in tumor immunity.', 'Selective depletion of regulatory T cells enhances the immunogenicity of a recombinant-based vaccine against Sporothrix spp.', 'Vaccination with a shared oncogenic tumor-self antigen elicits a population of CD8+ T cells with a regulatory phenotype.', 'Analysis of the CD8+ IL-10+ T cell response elicited by vaccination with the oncogenic tumor-self protein D52.', 'Dendritic cell-based vaccine efficacy: aiming for hot spots.', 'Overexpressed oncogenic tumor-self antigens.']"""

In vitro cell culture models simulating tissue or tumor microenvironment are necessary tools to delineate epithelial-stromal interactions including paracrine function, yet an ideal three-dimensional (3D) tumor model specifically studying paracrine function is currently lacking. In order to fill this void we developed a novel 3D co-culture model in double-layered alginate hydrogel microspheres, incorporating prostate cancer epithelial and stromal cells in separate compartments of the microspheres. The cells remained confined and viable within their respective spheres for over 30 days. As a proof of principle regarding paracrine function of the model, we measured shedded component of E-cadherin (sE-cad) in the conditioned media, a major membrane bound cell adhesive molecule that is highly dysregulated in cancers including prostate cancer. In addition to demonstrating that sE-cad can be reliably quantified in the conditioned media, the time course experiments also demonstrated that the amount of sE-cad is influenced by epithelial-stromal interaction. In conclusion, the study establishes a novel 3D in vitro co-culture model that can be used to study cell-cell paracrine interaction.""","""['Xiaolan Fang', 'Sivanandane Sittadjody', 'Kenneth Gyabaah', 'Emmanuel C Opara', 'Kethandapatti C Balaji']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Differential impact of paired patient-derived BPH and normal adjacent stromal cells on benign prostatic epithelial cell growth in 3D culture.', 'Stromal-epithelial crosstalk provides a suitable microenvironment for the progression of ovarian cancer cells in vitro.', 'Stromal transforming growth factor-beta signaling mediates prostatic response to androgen ablation by paracrine Wnt activity.', 'New targets for therapy in prostate cancer: modulation of stromal-epithelial interactions.', 'Key participants of the tumor microenvironment of the prostate: an approach of the structural dynamic of cellular elements and extracellular matrix components during epithelial-stromal transition.', '3D bioprinting and its innovative approach for biomedical applications.', '3D Cancer Models: Depicting Cellular Crosstalk within the Tumour Microenvironment.', '3D-culture models as drug-testing platforms in canine lymphoma and their cross talk with lymph node-derived stromal cells.', 'Differential impact of paired patient-derived BPH and normal adjacent stromal cells on benign prostatic epithelial cell growth in 3D culture.', 'Recent Advances in Cancer Plasticity: Cellular Mechanisms, Surveillance Strategies, and Therapeutic Optimization.']"""

To overcome this limitation, we recently introduced the concept of nanochemoprevention by encapsulating useful bioactive food components for their slow and sustained release. Here, we report the synthesis, characterization and efficacy assessment of a nanotechnology-based oral formulation of chitosan nanoparticles encapsulating epigallocatechin-3-gallate (Chit-nanoEGCG) for the treatment of prostate cancer (PCa) in a preclinical setting. Chit-nanoEGCG with a size of <200nm diameter and encapsulating EGCG as determined by dynamic light scattering and transmission electron microscope showed slow release of EGCG in simulated gastric juice acidic pH and faster release in simulated intestinal fluid. The antitumor efficacy of Chit-nanoEGCG was assessed in subcutaneously implanted 22Rν1 tumor xenografts in athymic nude mice. Treatment with Chit-nanoEGCG resulted in significant inhibition of tumor growth and secreted prostate-specific antigen levels compared with EGCG and control groups. In tumor tissues of mice treated with Chit-nanoEGCG, compared with groups treated with EGCG and controls, there was significant (i) induction of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerases cleavage, (ii) increase in the protein expression of Bax with concomitant decrease in Bcl-2, (iii) activation of caspases and (iv) reduction in Ki-67 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen.

In two xenograft models of prostate cancer, levels of tumor-derived PTHrP correlated with CD11b(+)Gr1(+) cell recruitment and microvessel density in the tumor tissue, with evidence for mediation of CD11b(+)Gr1(+) cell-derived MMP-9 but not tumor-derived VEGF-A. CD11b(+)Gr1(+) cells isolated from mice with PTHrP-overexpressing tumors exhibited relatively increased proangiogenic potential, suggesting that prostate tumor-derived PTHrP potentiates this activity of CD11b(+)Gr1(+) cells. Administration of neutralizing PTHrP monoclonal antibody reduced CD11b(+)Gr1(+) cells and MMP-9 in the tumors. Mechanistic investigations in vivo revealed that PTHrP elevated Y418 phosphorylation levels in Src family kinases in CD11b(+)Gr1(+) cells via osteoblast-derived interleukin-6 and VEGF-A, thereby upregulating MMP-9.

However, choline metabolism is not increased in a considerable number of cases, whereas prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is overexpressed in most PCs. Therefore, a (68)Ga-labelled PSMA ligand could be superior to choline tracers by obtaining a high contrast. The aim of this study was to compare such a novel tracer with standard choline-based PET/CT.  Methods:   Thirty-seven patients with biochemical relapse of PC [mean prostate-specific antigen (PSA) 11.1 ± 24.1 ng/ml, range 0.01-116] were retrospectively analysed after (18)F-fluoromethylcholine and (68)Ga-PSMA PET/CT within a time window of 30 days. Radiotracer uptake that was visually considered as PC was semi-quantitatively analysed by measuring the maximum standardized uptake values (SUVmax) of the scans acquired 1 h after injection of (68)Ga-PSMA complex solution (median 132 MBq, range 59-263 MBq) and (18)F-fluoromethylcholine (median 237 MBq, range 114-374 MBq), respectively. In addition, tumour to background ratios were calculated.  Results:   A total of 78 lesions characteristic for PC were detected in 32 patients using (68)Ga-PSMA PET/CT and 56 lesions were detected in 26 patients using choline PET/CT. The higher detection rate in (68)Ga-PSMA PET/CT was statistically significant (p=0.04). In five patients no lesion was found with both methods. All lesions detected by (18)F-fluoromethylcholine PET/CT were also seen by (68)Ga-PSMA PET/CT. In (68)Ga-PSMA PET/CT SUVmax was clearly (>10 %) higher in 62 of 78 lesions (79.1 %) and the tumour to background ratio was clearly (>10 %) higher in 74 of 78 lesions (94.9 %) when compared to (18)F-fluoromethylcholine PET/CT.

Specifically, it confers resistance to typically pro-oxidant agents, such as cisplatin (CDDP) and doxorubicin (Doxo), and to taxanes. USP2a overexpression protects from drug-induced oxidative stress by reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and stabilizing the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨ), thus impairing downstream p38 activation and triggering of apoptosis. The molecular mediator of the USP2a protective function is the glutathione (GSH). Through miR-34b/c-driven c-Myc regulation, USP2a increases intracellular GSH content, thus interfering with the oxidative cascade triggered by chemotherapeutic agents.

To address this, we interrogated a regional cancer registry for temporal changes in presenting disease characteristics.  Methods:   Prostate cancers diagnosed from 2000 to 2010 in the Anglian Cancer Network (n=21,044) were analysed. Risk groups (localised disease) were assigned based on NICE criteria. Age standardised incidence rates (IRs) were compared between 2000-2005 and 2006-2010 and plotted for yearly trends.  Results:   Over the decade, overall IR increased significantly (P<0.00001), whereas metastasis rates fell (P<0.0007). For localised disease, IR across all risk groups also increased but at different rates (P<0.00001). The most striking change was a three-fold increase in intermediate-risk cancers. Increased IR was evident across all PSA and stage ranges but with no upward PSA or stage shift. In contrast, IR of histological diagnosis of low-grade cancers fell over the decade, whereas intermediate and high-grade diagnosis increased significantly (P<0.00001).  Conclusion:   This study suggests evidence of a significant upward migration in intermediate and high-grade histological diagnosis over the decade. This is most likely to be due to a change in histological reporting of diagnostic prostate biopsies. On the basis of this data, increasing proportions of newly diagnosed cancers will be considered eligible for radical treatment, which will have an impact on health resource planning and provision.""","""['D C Greenberg', 'K A Wright', 'A Lophathanon', 'K R Muir', 'V J Gnanapragasam']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Br J Cancer""","""['Diagnostic characteristics of lethal prostate cancer.', 'Metastatic Prostate Cancer Incidence and Prostate-specific Antigen Testing: New Insights from the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer.', 'Incidence trends of prostate cancer in East Anglia, before and during the era of PSA diagnostic testing.', 'Population-based prostate cancer trends in the United States: patterns of change in the era of prostate-specific antigen.', 'Prostate cancer in East Asia: evolving trend over the last decade.', ""DKK3's protective role in prostate cancer is partly due to the modulation of immune-related pathways."", 'Models predicting survival to guide treatment decision-making in newly diagnosed primary non-metastatic prostate cancer: a systematic review.', 'Literature review of the burden of prostate cancer in Germany, France, the United Kingdom and Canada.', 'Individual prognosis at diagnosis in nonmetastatic prostate cancer: Development and external validation of the PREDICT Prostate multivariable model.', 'Factors influencing job loss and early retirement in working men with prostate cancer-findings from the population-based Life After Prostate Cancer Diagnosis (LAPCD) study.']"""

We developed the inguinal hernia prevention procedure based on our prior study. Patent processus vaginalis is an independent predictor of inguinal hernia after robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.  Materials and methods:   We reviewed 74 patients (98 groins) with patent processus vaginalis during robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy between May 2007 and April 2013. Of these patients 38 (47 groins) did not undergo the inguinal hernia prevention procedure and 36 (51 groins) were treated with this procedure. For the inguinal hernia prevention the lateral side internal inguinal floor of the patent processus vaginalis was incised and dissected along the spermatic cord. Hemostatic agents were plugged into the end of the dissected canal. After plugging, the internal inguinal floor was closed. We compared the incidence of postoperative inguinal hernia between the 2 groups.  Results:   Among the 47 groins of the patients who did not undergo the inguinal hernia prevention procedure, postoperative inguinal hernia occurred in 16 groins (34.0%) and developed by a mean of 13.8 ± 8.5 months. In contrast, none of the patients who underwent the inguinal hernia prevention procedure experienced postoperative inguinal hernia during the followup of 11.8 ± 6.2 months. This inguinal hernia prevention procedure required approximately 3 extra minutes. During followup there were no intraoperative or postoperative complications related to the inguinal hernia prevention procedure.  Conclusions:   Using our simple inguinal hernia prevention procedure, the preventive effect was remarkable. However, studies in a larger patient population with a longer followup should be performed to prove the ultimate clinical impact of this inguinal hernia prevention procedure.""","""['Dong Hoon Lee', 'Kyo Chul Koo', 'Seung Hwan Lee', 'Byung Ha Chung']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Patent processus vaginalis in adults who underwent robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy: predictive signs of postoperative inguinal hernia in the internal inguinal floor.', 'Long-Term Results of the Plugging Method with Regard to the Prevention of a Postoperative Inguinal Hernia After Robot-Assisted Laparoscopic Prostatectomy: A Retrospective Study.', 'The processus vaginalis transection method is superior to the simple prophylactic procedure for prevention of inguinal hernia after radical prostatectomy.', 'The impact of previous laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair on radical prostatectomy.', 'Current status of robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy: how does it compare with other surgical approaches?', 'Impact of Pelvic Anatomical Changes Caused by Radical Prostatectomy.', 'A low subcutaneous fat mass is a risk factor for the development of inguinal hernia after radical prostatectomy.', 'Postoperative inguinal hernia after robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer: evaluation of risk factors and recommendation of a convenient prophylactic procedure.', 'Robot-assisted radical prostatectomy may induce inguinal hernia within the first 2 years: An 11-year single-surgeon experience of >400 cases.', 'Scrotal pain and ulceration post HIPEC: a case report.']"""

However, the limited literature is dominated by the use of the Cyberknife platform. This led to an international phase III study comparing outcomes for Cyberknife SBRT with both surgery and conventionally fractionated intensity-modulated radiotherapy (the PACE study). We aim to compare Cyberknife delivery with Rapidarc, a more widely available treatment platform.  Materials and methods:   The scans of six previous prostate radiotherapy patients with a range of prostate sizes were chosen. The clinical target volume was defined as the prostate gland, with 3 mm added for the Cyberknife planning target volume (PTV) and 5 mm for the Rapidarc PTV. Accuray multiplan v. 4.5 was used for planning with delivery on a Cyberknife VSI system v9.5; Varian Eclipse v10 was used for Rapidarc planning with delivery using a Varian 21EX linear accelerator. Both systems attempted to deliver at least 35 Gy to the PTV in five fractions with PTV heterogeneity <12%.  Results:   All organ at risk (OAR) constraints were achieved by both platforms, whereas the Cyberknife failed to achieve the desired PTV homogeneity constraint in two cases. In other OARs without constraints, Cyberknife delivered higher doses. The volume of the 35 Gy isodose was slightly larger with Rapidarc, but conversely at doses <35 Gy normal tissues received higher doses with Cyberknife. The mean planning and delivery time was in favour of Rapidarc.  Conclusions:   We have shown that there is no discernible dosimetric advantage to choosing Cyberknife over Rapidarc for SBRT delivery in prostate cancer. Given the significant benefits of Rapidarc in terms of availability, planning and delivery time, the authors suggest that phase III trials of SBRT should include Rapidarc or equivalent rotational delivery platforms.""","""['N D Macdougall', 'C Dean', 'R Muirhead']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Clin Oncol (R Coll Radiol)""","""['New horizons and hurdles for UK radiotherapy: can prostate stereotactic body radiotherapy show the way?', 'Dosimetric comparison of two arc-based stereotactic body radiotherapy techniques for early-stage lung cancer.', 'Dosimetric advantages and superior treatment delivery efficiency of RapidArc over conventional intensity-modulated radiotherapy in high-risk prostate cancer involving seminal vesicles and pelvic nodes.', 'Dosimetric Comparison and Evaluation of 4 Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy Techniques for the Treatment of Prostate Cancer.', 'Current role of image-guided robotic radiosurgery (Cyberknife(®) ) for prostate cancer treatment.', 'Emerging technologies in stereotactic body radiotherapy.', 'Plan comparison of prostate stereotactic radiotherapy in spacer implant patients.', 'Development of raster scanning IMRT using a robotic radiosurgery system.', 'Prostate Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy With Halcyon 2.0: Treatment Plans Comparison Based on RTOG 0938 Protocol.', 'Prostate SBRT using O-Ring Halcyon Linac - Plan quality, delivery efficiency, and accuracy.', 'Dosimetric comparison among cyberknife, helical tomotherapy and VMAT for hypofractionated treatment in localized prostate cancer.']"""

We decided to explore the in vitro and in vivo effect of PPRHs in cancer choosing survivin as a target since it is involved in apoptosis, mitosis and angiogenesis, and overexpressed in different tumors. We designed four PPRHs against the survivin gene, one of them directed against the template strand and three against different regions of the coding strand. These PPRHs were tested in PC3 prostate cancer cells in an in vitro screening of cell viability and apoptosis. PPRHs against the promoter sequence were the most effective and caused a decrease in survivin mRNA and protein levels. We confirmed the binding between the selected PPRHs and their target sequences in the survivin gene. In addition we determined that both the template- and the coding-PPRH targeting the survivin promoter were interfering with the binding of transcription factors Sp1 and GATA-3, respectively. Finally, we conducted two in vivo efficacy assays using the Coding-PPRH against the survivin promoter and performing two routes of administration, namely intratumoral and intravenous, in a subcutaneous xenograft tumor model of PC3 prostate cancer cells. The results showed that the chosen Coding-PPRH proved to be effective in decreasing tumor volume, and reduced the levels of survivin protein and the formation of blood vessels. These findings represent the preclinical proof of principle of PPRHs as a new silencing tool for cancer gene therapy.""","""['Laura Rodríguez', 'Xenia Villalobos', 'Sheila Dakhel', 'Laura Padilla', 'Rosa Hervas', 'Jose Luis Hernández', 'Carlos J Ciudad', 'Véronique Noé']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Biochem Pharmacol""","""['Polypurine Reverse Hoogsteen Hairpins as a Gene Silencing Tool for Cancer.', 'Effect of Polypurine Reverse Hoogsteen Hairpins on Relevant Cancer Target Genes in Different Human Cell Lines.', 'Improved design of PPRHs for gene silencing.', 'Stability and immunogenicity properties of the gene-silencing polypurine reverse Hoogsteen hairpins.', 'Nucleic acids therapeutics using PolyPurine Reverse Hoogsteen hairpins.', 'In Vitro and In Vivo Effects of the Combination of Polypurine Reverse Hoogsteen Hairpins against HER-2 and Trastuzumab in Breast Cancer Cells.', 'Trioleyl Pyridinium, a Cationic Transfection Agent for the Lipofection of Therapeutic Oligonucleotides into Mammalian Cells.', 'Multi-Functionalized Heteroduplex Antisense Oligonucleotides for Targeted Intracellular Delivery and Gene Silencing in HeLa Cells.', 'Targeting KRAS Regulation with PolyPurine Reverse Hoogsteen Oligonucleotides.', 'Gene Correction of Point Mutations Using PolyPurine Reverse Hoogsteen Hairpins Technology.']"""

Reduced INPP4B expression is associated with poor outcomes for breast, prostate, and ovarian cancer patients. INPP4B contains a CX5R catalytic motif characteristic of dual-specificity phosphatases, such as PTEN. Lipid phosphatase activity of INPP4B has previously been described. In this report we show that INPP4B can dephosphorylate para-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP) and 6,8-difluoro-4-methylumbelliferyl (DiFMUP), synthetic phosphotyrosine analogs, suggesting that INPP4B has protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) activity. Using mutagenesis, we examined the functional role of specific amino acids within the INPP4B C842KSAKDR catalytic site. The K843M mutant displayed increased pNPP hydrolysis, the K846M mutant lost lipid phosphatase activity with no effect on PTP activity, and the D847E substitution ablated PTP activity and significantly reduced lipid phosphatase activity. Further, we show that INPP4B but not PTEN is able to reduce tyrosine phosphorylation of Akt1 and both the lipid and PTP activity of INPP4B likely contribute to the reduction of Akt1 phosphorylation. Taken together our data identified key residues in the INPP4B catalytic domain associated with lipid and protein phosphatase activities and found a robust downstream target regulated by INPP4B but not PTEN.""","""['Sandra M Lopez', 'Myles C Hodgson', 'Charles Packianathan', 'Ozlem Bingol-Ozakpinar', 'Fikriye Uras', 'Barry P Rosen', 'Irina U Agoulnik']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Biochem Biophys Res Commun""","""['INPP4B and PTEN Loss Leads to PI-3,4-P2 Accumulation and Inhibition of PI3K in TNBC.', 'The INPP4B paradox: Like PTEN, but different.', 'Regulation of PI3K effector signalling in cancer by the phosphoinositide phosphatases.', 'INPP4B Is a PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 Phosphatase That Can Act as a Tumor Suppressor.', 'Evidence that SHIP-1 contributes to phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate metabolism in T lymphocytes and can regulate novel phosphoinositide 3-kinase effectors.', 'INPP4B protects from metabolic\xa0syndrome and associated disorders.', 'Novel Small-Molecule Inhibitor for the Oncogenic Tyrosine Phosphatase SHP2 with Anti-Breast Cancer Cell Effects.', 'Deletion of inositol polyphosphate 4-phosphatase type-II B affects spermatogenesis in mice.', 'Inositol polyphosphate 4-phosphatase type II regulation of androgen receptor activity.', 'INPP4B promotes cell survival via SGK3 activation in NPM1-mutated leukemia.']"""

Patient exposure to toxic environmental chemicals and other stressors is ubiquitous, and preconception and prenatal exposure to toxic environmental agents can have a profound and lasting effect on reproductive health across the life course.Prenatal exposure to certain chemicals has been documented to increase the risk of cancer in childhood; adult male exposure to pesticides is linked to altered semen quality, sterility, and prostate cancer; and postnatal exposure to some pesticides can interfere with all developmental stages of reproductive function in adult females, including puberty, menstruation and ovulation, fertility and fecundity, and menopause. Many environmental factors harmful to reproductive health disproportionately affect vulnerable and underserved populations,which leaves some populations, including underserved women, more vulnerable to adverse reproductive health effects than other populations. The evidence that links exposure to toxic environmental agents and adverse reproductive and developmental health outcomes is sufficiently robust, and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Society for Reproductive Medicine join leading scientists and other clinical practitioners in calling for timely action to identify and reduce exposure to toxic environmental agents while addressing the consequences of such exposure.""","""['ACOG Committee Opinion No ']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Fertil Steril""","""['Exposure to toxic environmental agents.', 'International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics opinion on reproductive health impacts of exposure to toxic environmental chemicals.', 'Toxic environmental chemicals: the role of reproductive health professionals in preventing harmful exposures.', 'Science linking environmental contaminant exposures with fertility and reproductive health impacts in the adult female.', 'Promoting Risk Identification and Reduction of Cardiovascular Disease in Women Through Collaboration With Obstetricians and Gynecologists: A Presidential Advisory From the American Heart Association and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.', 'Invited Perspective: Toxic Metals and Hypertensive Disorders of Pregnancy.', 'Constitutive Androstane Receptor Agonist, TCPOBOP: Maternal Exposure Impairs the Growth and Development of Female Offspring in Mice.', 'Urinary Phenols in Early to Midpregnancy and Risk of Gestational Diabetes Mellitus: A Longitudinal Study in a Multiracial Cohort.', 'Maternal dietary patterns during pregnancy and exposure to persistent endocrine disrupting chemicals in two European birth cohorts.', ""Phenols, Parabens, Phthalates and Puberty: a Systematic Review of Synthetic Chemicals Commonly Found in Personal Care Products and Girls' Pubertal Development.""]"""

However, direct genetic evidence of OLFM4 gene alteration in human prostate cancer has not yet been obtained. In this study, we investigated the genetics, protein expression, and functions of the OLFM4 gene in human prostate cancer. We found overall 25% deletions within the OLFM4 gene in cancerous epithelial cells compared with adjacent normal epithelial cells that were microdissected from 31 prostate cancer specimens using laser-capture microdissection and genomic DNA sequencing. We found 28% to 45% hemizygous and 15% to 57% homozygous deletions of the OLFM4 gene via fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis from 44 different prostate cancer patient samples. Moreover, homozygous deletion of the OLFM4 gene significantly correlated with advanced prostate cancer. By using immunohistochemical analysis of 162 prostate cancer tissue array samples representing a range of Gleason scores, we found that OLFM4 protein expression correlated inversely with advanced prostate cancer, consistent with the genetic results. We also showed that a truncated mutant of OLFM4 that lacks the olfactomedin domain eliminated suppression of PC-3 prostate cancer cell growth. Together, our findings indicate that OLFM4 is a novel candidate tumor-suppressor gene for chromosome 13q and may shed new light on strategies that could be used for the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of prostate cancer patients.""","""['Hongzhen Li', 'Jaime Rodriguez-Canales', 'Wenli Liu', 'Jianqiong Zhu', 'Jeffrey C Hanson', 'Svetlana Pack', 'Zhengping Zhuang', 'Michael R Emmert-Buck', 'Griffin P Rodgers']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Am J Pathol""","""['Olfactomedin 4 downregulation is associated with tumor initiation, growth and progression in human prostate cancer.', 'Olfactomedin 4 suppresses prostate cancer cell growth and metastasis via negative interaction with cathepsin D and SDF-1.', 'Olfactomedin 4 deficiency promotes prostate neoplastic progression and is associated with upregulation of the hedgehog-signaling pathway.', 'Olfactomedin 4 expression and functions in innate immunity, inflammation, and cancer.', 'Olfactomedin 4, a\xa0novel marker for the differentiation and progression of gastrointestinal cancers.', 'Characterization of olfactomedin 4+ cells in prostate and urethral-tube epithelium during murine postnatal development and in adult mice.', 'Olfactomedin 4 produces dysplasia but suppresses metastasis of colon cancer.', 'Olfactomedin 4 mediation of prostate stem/progenitor-like cell proliferation and differentiation via MYC.', 'High expression of olfactomedin-4 is correlated with chemoresistance and poor prognosis in pancreatic cancer.', 'OLFM4 Enhances STAT3 Activation and Promotes Tumor Progression by Inhibiting GRIM19 Expression in Human Hepatocellular Carcinoma.']"""
