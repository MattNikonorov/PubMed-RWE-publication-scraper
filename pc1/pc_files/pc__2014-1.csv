Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in blood may employ different pathways to cross blood endothelial barrier and establish a metastatic niche. Several studies provide evidence that prostate cancer (PCa) cell tethering and rolling on microvascular endothelium via E-selectin/E-selectin ligand interactions under shear flow theoretically promote extravasation and contribute to the development of metastases. However, it is unknown if CTCs from PCa patients interact with E-selectin expressed on endothelium, initiating a route for tumor metastases. Here we report that CTCs derived from PCa patients showed interactions with E-selectin and E-selectin expressing endothelial cells. To examine E-selectin-mediated interactions of PCa cell lines and CTCs derived from metastatic PCa patients, we used fluorescently-labeled anti-prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) monoclonal antibody J591-488 which is internalized following cell-surface binding. We employed a microscale flow device consisting of E-selectin-coated microtubes and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) on parallel-plate flow chamber simulating vascular endothelium. We observed that J591-488 did not significantly alter the rolling behavior in PCa cells at shear stresses below 3 dyn/cm(2). CTCs obtained from 31 PCa patient samples showed that CTCs tether and stably interact with E-selectin and E-selectin expressing HUVECs at physiological shear stress. Interestingly, samples collected during disease progression demonstrated significantly more CTC/E-selectin interactions than samples during times of therapeutic response (p=0.016). Analysis of the expression of sialyl Lewis X (sLe(x)) in patient samples showed that a small subset comprising 1.9-18.8% of CTCs possess high sLe(x) expression. Furthermore, E-selectin-mediated interactions between prostate CTCs and HUVECs were diminished in the presence of anti-E-selectin neutralizing antibody. CTC-Endothelial interactions provide a novel insight into potential adhesive mechanisms of prostate CTCs as a means to initiate metastasis.""","""['Gunjan Gakhar', 'Vicente N Navarro', 'Madelyn Jurish', 'Guang Yu Lee', 'Scott T Tagawa', 'Naveed H Akhtar', 'Marco Seandel', 'Yue Geng', 'He Liu', 'Neil H Bander', 'Paraskevi Giannakakou', 'Paul J Christos', 'Michael R King', 'David M Nanus']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Analysis of glycosyltransferase expression in metastatic prostate cancer cells capable of rolling activity on microvascular endothelial (E)-selectin.', 'Rolling of human bone-metastatic prostate tumor cells on human bone marrow endothelium under shear flow is mediated by E-selectin.', 'Enhanced tumor cell isolation by a biomimetic combination of E-selectin and anti-EpCAM: implications for the effective separation of circulating tumor cells (CTCs).', 'SA-Lea and tumor metastasis: the old prediction and recent findings.', 'Circulating tumor cell-blood cell crosstalk: Biology and clinical relevance.', 'Long Non-Coding RNAs as Novel Targets for Phytochemicals to Cease Cancer Metastasis.', 'TRAIL-coated leukocytes to kill circulating tumor cells in the flowing blood from prostate cancer patients.', 'Metastatic Spread in Prostate Cancer Patients Influencing Radiotherapy Response.', ""MicroRNA-128 Confers Anti-Endothelial Adhesion and Anti-Migration Properties to Counteract Highly Metastatic Cervical Cancer Cells' Migration in a Parallel-Plate Flow Chamber."", 'Endothelial Glycocalyx-Mediated Intercellular Interactions: Mechanisms and Implications for Atherosclerosis and Cancer Metastasis.']"""

The FDA recently concluded that the increased prevalence of high-grade tumors among 5-ARI-treated patients must not be neglected, and they decided to disallow the use of 5-ARIs for prostate cancer prevention. This study was conducted to verify the effects of finasteride on prostate cell migration and invasion and the related enzymes/proteins in normal human and tumoral prostatic cell lines.  Materials and methods:   RWPE-1, LNCaP, PC3 and DU145 cells were cultivated to 60% confluence and exposed for different periods to either 10 µM or 50 µM finasteride that was diluted in culture medium. The conditioned media were collected and concentrated, and MMP2 and MMP9 activities and TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 protein expression were determined. Cell viability, migration and invasion were analyzed, and the remaining cell extracts were submitted to androgen receptor (AR) detection by western blotting techniques. Experiments were carried out in triplicate.  Results:   Cell viability was not significantly affected by finasteride exposure. Finasteride significantly downregulated MMP2 and MMP9 activities in RWPE-1 and PC3 cells and MMP2 in DU145 cells. TIMP-2 expression in RWPE-1 cells was upregulated after exposure. The cell invasion of all four tested cell lines was inhibited by exposure to 50 µM of finasteride, and migration inhibition only occurred for RWPE-1 and LNCaP cells. AR was expressed by LNCaP, RWPE-1 and PC3 cells.  Conclusions:   Although the debate on the higher incidence of high-grade prostate cancer among 5-ARI-treated patients remains, our findings indicate that finasteride may attenuate tumor aggressiveness and invasion, which could vary depending on the androgen responsiveness of a patient's prostate cells.""","""['Andrei Moroz', 'Flávia K Delella', 'Rodrigo Almeida', 'Lívia Maria Lacorte', 'Wágner José Fávaro', 'Elenice Deffune', 'Sérgio L Felisbino']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Crude extract of Euphorbia formosana inhibits the migration and invasion of DU145 human prostate cancer cells: The role of matrix metalloproteinase-2/9 inhibition via the MAPK signaling pathway.', 'Differential regulation of matrix metalloproteinase-9, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) and TIMP-2 expression in co-cultures of prostate cancer and stromal cells.', 'Fibronectin induces MMP2 expression in human prostate cancer cells.', 'Finasteride.', 'Prostate cancer prevention with 5-alpha reductase inhibitors: concepts and controversies.', 'Changes in the expression of cancer- and metastasis-related genes and proteins after metformin treatment under different metabolic conditions in endometrial cancer cells.', 'Comparative Cytotoxic Activity of Hydroxytyrosol and Its Semisynthetic Lipophilic Derivatives in Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Cell-free DNA promotes malignant transformation in non-tumor cells.', 'Dihydrotestosterone Induces Proliferation, Migration, and Invasion of Human Glioblastoma Cell Lines.', 'Neddylation inactivation represses androgen receptor transcription and inhibits growth, survival and invasion of prostate cancer cells.']"""

It is classically thought to be mainly synthesized in the liver and then secreted into the circulating system, where it binds to sex steroids with a high affinity and modulates the bio-availability of the hormones. Other organs known to produce SHBG include brain, uterus, testis, prostate, breast and ovary, and the local expressed SHBG may play an important role in tumor development. However, SHBG expression status and its clinicopathological significance in ovarian cancer cells are not reported yet. In our present study, we examined and found the variable SHBG expression in four ovarian cancer cell lines (OV-90, OVCAR-3, SKOV-3 and ES-2) by immunocytochemistry and Western blotting. We then extended our study to 248 ovarian carcinoma samples, which were collected at The Norwegian Radium Hospital, Oslo University Hospital with complete clinical information, and discovered that SHBG was variably expressed in these ovarian carcinomas. Higher level of SHBG expression was significantly associated with more aggressive histological subtype (p = 0.022), higher FIGO stage (p = 0.018) and higher histological grade (grade of differentiation, p = 0.020), although association between SHBG expression and OS/PFS was not observed.

Here, we demonstrate that the αvβ6 integrin is upregulated in human prostate cancer bone metastasis. In prostate cancer cells, this integrin is a functionally active receptor for fibronectin and latency-associated peptide-TGF-β1; it mediates attachment and migration upon ligand binding and is localized in focal contacts. Given the propensity of prostate cancer cells to form bone metastatic lesions, we investigated whether the αvβ6 integrin promotes this type of metastasis. We show for the first time that αvβ6 selectively induces matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2) in vitro in multiple prostate cancer cells and promotes osteolysis in vivo in an immunodeficient mouse model of bone metastasis through upregulation of MMP2, but not MMP9. The effect of αvβ6 on MMP2 expression and activity is independent of androgen receptor in the analyzed prostate cancer cells. Increased levels of parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP), known to induce osteoclastogenesis, were also observed in αvβ6-expressing cells. However, by using MMP2 short hairpin RNA, we demonstrate that the αvβ6 effect on bone loss is due to upregulation of soluble MMP2 by the cancer cells, not due to changes in tumor growth rate. Another related αv-containing integrin, αvβ5, fails to show similar responses, underscoring the significance of αvβ6 activity. Overall, these mechanistic studies establish that expression of a single integrin, αvβ6, contributes to the cancer cell-mediated program of osteolysis by inducing matrix degradation through MMP2.

Prevention and treatment of this terminal phase of prostate cancer requires improved molecular understanding of the process as well as markers indicative of molecular progression. Through biochemical analyses and loss-of-function in vivo studies, we demonstrate that the cell adhesion molecule, activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule (ALCAM), is actively shed from metastatic prostate cancer cells by the sheddase ADAM17 in response to TGF-β. Not only is this posttranslational modification of ALCAM a marker of prostate cancer progression, the molecule is also required for effective metastasis to bone. Biochemical analysis of prostate cancer cell lines reveals that ALCAM expression and shedding is elevated in response to TGF-β signaling. Both in vitro and in vivo shedding is mediated by ADAM17. Longitudinal analysis of circulating ALCAM in tumor-bearing mice revealed that shedding of tumor, but not host-derived ALCAM is elevated during growth of the cancer. Gene-specific knockdown of ALCAM in bone-metastatic PC3 cells greatly diminished both skeletal dissemination and tumor growth in bone. The reduced growth of ALCAM knockdown cells corresponded to an increase in apoptosis (caspase-3) and decreased proliferation (Ki67).

Materials and methods:   We retrospectively analyzed oncologic and urological outcomes of 11 consecutive patients treated at our institution between 1998 and 2012.  Results:   Two patients underwent urethrectomy and placement of a heterotopic catheterizable ileal neobladder. The membranous urethra was preserved in 9 patients, 6 underwent primary Padua ileal neobladder at radical cystectomy, 2 underwent delayed Padua ileal neobladder and 1 underwent bilateral cutaneous ureterostomy. Four of these 9 patients experienced disease recurrence, including local recurrence in 2 despite negative intraoperative biopsies. Survivors undergoing heterotopic catheterizable ileal neobladder or primary Padua ileal neobladder learned to empty the bladder to completion without long-term upper tract deterioration. Both cases managed by delayed Padua ileal neobladder required clean intermittent catheterization eventually. Erections were reported in 5 of 6 surviving males.  Conclusions:   The Padua ileal neobladder allowed preservation of volitional urethral voiding in all survivors in whom it was placed at radical cystectomy. Nevertheless, local recurrence was noted in 2 of the 9 cases where the membranous urethra was preserved. By comparison, patients undergoing delayed Padua ileal neobladder after attaining disease-free status never achieved voiding per urethra.

The prevalence and consequences of bone metastases (BM) have been examined across tumor sites using healthcare claims data however the reliability of these claims-based BM measures has not been investigated.  Methods:   This retrospective cohort study utilized linked registry and claims (SEER-Medicare) data on men diagnosed with incident stage IV M1 PCa between 2005 and 2007. The SEER-based measure of incident BM was cross-tabulated with three separate Medicare claims approaches to assess concordance. Sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value (PPV) were calculated to assess the concordance between registry- and claims-based measures.  Results:   Based on 2,708 PCa patients in SEER-Medicare, there is low to moderate concordance between the SEER- and claims-based measures of incident BM. Across the three approaches, sensitivity ranged from 0.48 (0.456 - 0.504) to 0.598 (0.574 - 0.621), specificity ranged from 0.538 (0.507 - 0.569) to 0.620 (0.590 - 0.650) and PPV ranged from 0.679 (0.651 - 0.705) to 0.690 (0.665 - 0.715). A comparison of utilization patterns between SEER-based and claims-based measures suggested avenues for improving sensitivity.

Methods:   The efficacy and tolerability of Enz were investigated in men with progressive, metastatic, castrate-resistant prostate cancer who previously received Doc and AA. Toxicity, progression-free survival, time to prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression, and overall survival were retrospectively evaluated.  Results:   Sixty-one patients were included in the analysis. The median age was 69 years (interquartile range [IQR], 64-74 years), 57 patients (93%) had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status from 0 to 2, 48 patients (79%) had bone metastases, 33 patients (54%) had lymph node metastases, and 13 patients (21%) had visceral metastases. The median duration of Enz treatment was 14.9 weeks (IQR, 11.1-20.0 weeks), and 13 patients (21%) had a maximum PSA decline ≥50%.

Methods:   A comparison was performed of prospectively collected QOL data using the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) questionnaire. QOL data were collected during the first 2 years after treatment for men who received PT and IMRT. PT was delivered to 1243 men at a single center at doses from 76 grays (Gy) to 82 Gy. IMRT was delivered to 204 men who were included in the Prostate Cancer Outcomes and Satisfaction with Treatment Quality Assessment (PROSTQA) study in doses from 75.6 Gy to 79.4 Gy. The Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to compare EPIC outcomes by modality using baseline-adjusted scores at different time points. Individual questions were assessed by converting to binary outcomes and testing with generalized estimating equations.  Results:   No differences were observed in summary score changes for bowel, urinary incontinence, urinary irritative/obstructive, and sexual domains between the 2 cohorts. However, more men who received IMRT reported moderate/big problems with rectal urgency (P = 0.02) and frequent bowel movements (P = 0.05) than men who received PT.  Conclusions:   There were no differences in QOL summary scores between the IMRT and PT cohorts during early follow-up (up to 2-years).

Forced expression of miR-224 suppressed PCa cell proliferation, invasion and migration, and promoted cell apoptosis by downregulating TRIB1. Moreover, the expression level of miR-224 in PCa tissues was negatively correlated with that of TRIB1. miR-224 downregulation was frequently found in PCa tissues with metastasis, higher PSA level and clinical stage, whereas TRIB1 upregulation was significantly associated with metastasis. Both miR-224 downregulation and TRIB1 upregulation were significantly associated with poor biochemical recurrence-free survival of patients with PCa.

We used the Netherlands Cancer Registry data of 1,313,232 cancer survivors who were at risk to be subsequently diagnosed with CLL between 1989 and 2008. Cancer survivors were categorized based on gender, age, time since diagnosis of EPM and type of EPM. CLL was regarded synchronous when diagnosed within 3 months after diagnosis of EPM; metachronous CLLs were those diagnosed later. Overall, we found that cancer survivors had a 90 % higher risk to be diagnosed with CLL than the general population. In the first year after diagnosis, we found a more than four-fold increased risk of CLL (standardized incidence ratio (SIR), 4.4; 95 % confidence interval (CI), 4.1-4.8); however, no increased risk was observed after excluding synchronous cases. After 1 year, the excess risk of subsequent CLL ranged from 1.2 to 1.8. An increased risk for metachronous CLL was found in prostate (SIR 1.3; 95 % CI 1.1-1.5) and squamous cell skin cancer survivors (SIR 2.3; 95 % CI 1.9-2.7). Intensive clinical checkups after/around diagnosis of the EPM seemed to be the main cause for the increased risk of CLL among cancer survivors. However, possible shared risk factors between prostate cancer and CLL and skin cancer and CLL cannot be excluded. Further clinical research aimed at CLL as subsequent primary malignancy (SPM) is warranted to elucidate possible shared biological and predisposing risk factors.""","""['E C van den Broek', 'L Liu', 'E F M Posthuma', 'M L G Janssen-Heijnen', 'J W W Coebergh', 'I Soerjomataram']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Ann Hematol""","""['Risk of prostate cancer among cancer survivors in the Netherlands.', 'Risk of second cancer after chronic lymphocytic leukemia.', 'Risk of second malignancies in survivors of retinoblastoma: more than 40 years of follow-up.', 'Late effects in childhood cancer survivors: a review with a framing effect bias?', 'Second primary malignancy among cancer survivors - epidemiology, prognosis and clinical relevance.', 'Common genetic polymorphisms contribute to the association between chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and non-melanoma skin cancer.', 'fMRI and DTI in delayed development of number processing.']"""

Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining was performed for all selected blocks to detect HPV infection. The rate of infection was compared in the two studied groups.  Results:   Totally, HPV was detected in four blocks. HPV infection was positive in 10% (3/30) of cases with adenocarcinoma and 1.1% (1/90) of cases with BPH (P = 0.04, OR = 9.88, CI 95%). Mean age of patients with positive and negative HPV infection was 61.75 ± 8.3 and 68.51 ± 11.7 years, respectively.  Conclusion:   Considering the higher prevalence of HPV infection in prostatic adenocarcinoma, it is suggested that HPV could be probable risk factor for prostatic adenocarcinoma. It is recommended to investigate the prevalence of HPV infection in Iranian men and the outcome of prevention and treatment of HPV infection on prostatic adenocarcinoma.""","""['Mojgan Mokhtari', 'Faegheh Taghizadeh', 'Mohsen Hani']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Res Med Sci""","""['Human Papilloma Virus Detection by INNOLiPA HPV in Prostate Tissue from Men of Northeast Mexico.', 'Frequency and Type Distribution of Human Papilloma Virus in Patients with Prostate Cancer, Kerman, Southeast of Iran.', 'Evaluation of human papillomavirus infections in prostatic disease: a cross-sectional study in Iran.', 'Epidemiology of cervical cancer and human papilloma virus infection among Iranian women - analyses of national data and systematic review of the literature.', 'Human papilloma virus and genitourinary cancers: a narrative review.', 'Multiple pathogens and prostate cancer.', 'Evidence for a causal role by human papillomaviruses in prostate cancer - a systematic review.', 'Worldwide Prevalence of Human Papillomavirus and Relative Risk of Prostate Cancer: A Meta-analysis.']"""

In this study, the 20q13 region was shown to be frequently co-amplified with the androgen receptor (AR) in metastatic prostate cancer. Furthermore, the AR signaling axis, which plays an essential role in the pathogenesis of prostate cancer, was demonstrated to be central to the regulation of the 20q13 common amplified region (CAR). High-resolution mapping analyses revealed hot spots of AR recruitment to response elements in the vicinity of most genes located on the 20q13 CAR. Moreover, amplification of AR significantly co-occurred with CAR amplification on 20q13 and it was confirmed that the majority of AR-bound genes on the 20q13 CAR were indeed regulated by androgens. These data reveal that amplification of the AR is tightly linked to amplification of the AR-regulated CAR region on 20q13. These results suggest that the cross-talk between gene amplification and gene transcription is an important step in the development of castration-resistant metastatic disease.  Implications:   These novel results are a noteworthy example of the cross-talk between gene amplification and gene transcription in the development of advanced prostate cancer.""","""['David P Labbé', 'Dawid G Nowak', 'Geneviève Deblois', 'Laurent Lessard', 'Vincent Giguère', 'Lloyd C Trotman', 'Michel L Tremblay']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Res""","""['A three-marker FISH panel detects more genetic aberrations of AR, PTEN and TMPRSS2/ERG in castration-resistant or metastatic prostate cancers than in primary prostate tumors.', 'Angiogenin mediates androgen-stimulated prostate cancer growth and enables castration resistance.', 'The NLR-related protein NWD1 is associated with prostate cancer and modulates androgen receptor signaling.', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptor: what we know and what we expect in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Refinement of the androgen response element based on ChIP-Seq in androgen-insensitive and androgen-responsive prostate cancer cell lines.', 'PTP1B Deficiency Enables the Ability of a High-Fat Diet to Drive the Invasive Character of PTEN-Deficient Prostate Cancers.', 'Increased PTP1B expression and phosphatase activity in colorectal cancer results in a more invasive phenotype and worse patient outcome.', 'MYC Drives Pten/Trp53-Deficient Proliferation and Metastasis due to IL6 Secretion and AKT Suppression via PHLPP2.']"""

The aim of this study is to evaluate the long-term outcomes of external beam irradiation using three-dimensional two-dynamic conformal arc therapy, combined with neoadjuvant hormonal therapy, in patients with T1c-T2N0M0 prostate cancer.  Methods:   Between March 2003 and August 2007, 150 Japanese patients with T1c-T2N0M0 prostate cancer were definitively treated with three-dimensional two-dynamic conformal arc therapy. The median age, pretreatment prostate-specific antigen values and neoadjuvant hormonal therapy period were 73 years, 9.4 ng/ml and 6 months, respectively. In principle, 74 Gy was delivered to the planning target volume, although the total dose was reduced to 70 Gy in patients with unfavorable risk factors, such as severe diabetes mellitus or anticoagulant therapy. No adjuvant hormonal therapy was given to any patient. Salvage hormonal therapy was started when the prostate-specific antigen value exceeded 4 ng/ml in a monotonically increasing manner.  Results:   The median follow-up period was 79 months. Salvage hormonal therapy was initiated in 10 patients and the median prostate-specific antigen value at the initiation was 4.7 ng/ml. The 5-year Kaplan-Meier estimates of the biochemical relapse-free survival rate, the salvage hormonal therapy -free rate and the overall survival rate were 83.3% (95% confidence interval = 77.1-89.6%), 94.3% (95% confidence interval = 90.4-98.1%) and 96.3% (95% confidence interval = 93.1-99.5%), respectively. The 5-year cumulative incidence rates of developing more than Grade 2 late rectal and urinary toxicities were 5.5 and 2.9%, respectively.

Objective:   To identify efficient computed tomography (CT) screening scenarios in which relatively more lung cancer deaths are averted for fewer CT screening examinations.  Design:   Comparative modeling study using 5 independent models.  Data sources:   The National Lung Screening Trial; the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening trial; the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program; and the U.S. Smoking History Generator.  Target population:   U.S. cohort born in 1950.  Time horizon:   Cohort followed from ages 45 to 90 years.  Perspective:   Societal.  Intervention:   576 scenarios with varying eligibility criteria (age, pack-years of smoking, years since quitting) and screening intervals.  Outcome measures:   Benefits included lung cancer deaths averted or life-years gained. Harms included CT examinations, false-positive results (including those obtained from biopsy/surgery), overdiagnosed cases, and radiation-related deaths.  Results of best-case scenario:   The most advantageous strategy was annual screening from ages 55 through 80 years for ever-smokers with a smoking history of at least 30 pack-years and ex-smokers with less than 15 years since quitting. It would lead to 50% (model ranges, 45% to 54%) of cases of cancer being detected at an early stage (stage I/II), 575 screening examinations per lung cancer death averted, a 14% (range, 8.2% to 23.5%) reduction in lung cancer mortality, 497 lung cancer deaths averted, and 5250 life-years gained per the 100,000-member cohort. Harms would include 67,550 false-positive test results, 910 biopsies or surgeries for benign lesions, and 190 overdiagnosed cases of cancer (3.7% of all cases of lung cancer [model ranges, 1.4% to 8.3%]).  Results of sensitivity analysis:   The number of cancer deaths averted for the scenario varied across models between 177 and 862; the number of overdiagnosed cases of cancer varied between 72 and 426.  Limitations:   Scenarios assumed 100% screening adherence. Data derived from trials with short duration were extrapolated to lifetime follow-up.  Conclusion:   Annual CT screening for lung cancer has a favorable benefit-harm ratio for individuals aged 55 through 80 years with 30 or more pack-years' exposure to smoking.

MMP-9 is secreted in both the monomeric and dimeric form. Although there is little research on MMP-9 dimers, some studies have shown the dimer to be associated with more aggressive tumor progression. Our objective was to study the relative secretion patterns of MMP-9 monomer and dimer in a variety of cancer cell lines and the effect of a nutrient mixture (NM) containing lysine, proline, ascorbic acid and green tea extract on MMP-9 secretion. The cancer cell lines were grown in their respective media, supplemented with 10% FBS, penicillin (100 U/ml) and streptomycin (100 µg/ml) in 24-well tissue culture plates. At near confluence, the cells were treated with NM at 0,10, 50, 100, 500 and 1000 µg/ml. Parallel sets of cultures were treated with PMA (100 ng/ml) for induction of MMP-9. Cell MMP-9 secretion was assayed by gelatinase zymography. MMP-9 dimer secretion patterns of cancer cells fell into different categories. We observed no MMP-9 dimer in prostate DU-145 and PC-3, pancreatic MIA-Pa-Ca2, colon HCT-116, bladder T-24, head and neck FaDu, glioblastoma A-172, T-98 and LN-18 and leukemia HL-60, Jurkat, and Raji cell lines. MMP-dimer secretion only with PMA induction was seen in breast MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231, uterine SK-UT-1, lung A-549, tongue SC-25, melanoma A2058, osteosarcoma U-2OS, rhabdomyosarcoma, fibrosarcoma HT-1080, chondrosarcoma SW-1350 and liposarcoma SW-872. Cervical HeLa and DoTc 2 4510, renal 786-0 and HCC SK-Hep-1 cells exhibited MMP-9 dimer without PMA treatment and increased secretion with PMA treatment. Sarcomas had the highest levels of MMP-9 monomer and dimer with and without PMA among these cancer cell lines. Cervical, uterine and male breast cancer cell lines showed the next highest levels of MMP-9, followed by breast cancer cell lines. Melanoma, renal, lung, head and neck and HCC showed lower levels and prostate, glioblastoma, bladder and leukemia cell lines the lowest. NM showed dose-dependent inhibition of MMP-9 monomer and dimer in all cell lines tested. In conclusion, high MMP-9 and dimer secretion levels correlated with the most aggressive cancer cell lines. NM was effective in inhibiting MMP-9 and dimer secretion in all cell lines tested, suggesting its therapeutic potential as an antimetastatic agent.""","""['M W Roomi', 'T Kalinovsky', 'M Rath', 'A Niedzwiecki']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Int J Oncol""","""['Down-regulation of urokinase plasminogen activator and matrix metalloproteinases and up-regulation of their inhibitors by a novel nutrient mixture in human prostate cancer cell lines PC-3 and DU-145.', 'Modulation of uPA, MMPs and their inhibitors by a novel nutrient mixture in human glioblastoma cell lines.', 'Modulation of u-PA, MMPs and their inhibitors by a novel nutrient mixture in adult human sarcoma cell lines.', ""Osteopontin: it's role in regulation of cell motility and nuclear factor kappa B-mediated urokinase type plasminogen activator expression."", 'Micronutrient synergy--a new tool in effective control of metastasis and other key mechanisms of cancer.', 'Tetrahexyldecyl Ascorbate (THDC) Degrades Rapidly under Oxidative Stress but Can Be Stabilized by Acetyl Zingerone to Enhance Collagen Production and Antioxidant Effects.', 'Merkel Cell Polyomavirus Small Tumor Antigen Activates Matrix Metallopeptidase-9 Gene Expression for Cell Migration and Invasion.', 'A bi-specific inhibitor targeting IL-17A and MMP-9 reduces invasion and motility in MDA-MB-231 cells.', 'XTEN as Biological Alternative to PEGylation Allows Complete Expression of a Protease-Activatable Killin-Based Cytostatic.', 'Failure of matrix metalloproteinase-9 dimer induction by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate in normal human cell lines.']"""

The present cross-sectional study investigates whether calprotectin, the heterodimer of S100A8/S100A9 may serve as a urinary biomarker for the detection of urothelial bladder cancer.  Methods:   Urinary calprotectin concentrations were assessed in a population of 181 subjects including 46 cases of bladder cancer. 41 cases of renal cell cancer, 54 cases of prostate cancer, and 40 healthy subjects served as control. Acute kidney injury, urinary tract infection, previous BCG-treatment and secondary transurethral resection of the bladder tumor were defined as exclusion criteria. Assessment was performed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunohistochemistry detecting calprotectin.  Results:   Median calprotectin concentrations (ng/ml) were significantly higher in patients with bladder cancer than in healthy controls (522.3 vs. 51.0, p < 0.001), renal cell cancer (90.4, p < 0.001), and prostate cancer (71.8, p < 0.001). In urothelial carcinoma prominent immunostaining occurred in a subset of tumor cells and in infiltrating myeloid cells. Receiver operating characteristic analysis provided an area under the curve of 0.88 for the differentiation of bladder cancer and healthy control. A cut-off value of 140 ng/ml (determined by Youden's index) resulted in sensitivity and specificity values of 80.4 and 92.5 %. Low grade tumors were associated with significantly lower calprotectin concentrations than high grade tumors (351.9 vs. 1635.2 ng/ml, p = 0.004).

Results:   Nineteen patients were enrolled. No dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was seen with docetaxel doses up to 25 mg/m(2). At the 30 mg/m(2) level, 2 of 4 patients experienced DLTs of both grade 3 fatigue and dyspepsia.

Interest in integrating multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance-guided biopsy (MRGB) into the diagnostic pathway to reduce overdiagnosis and improve grading is gaining ground, but it remains uncertain whether this image-based strategy is cost-effective.  Objective:   To determine the cost-effectiveness of multiparametric MRI and MRGB compared with TRUSGB.  Design, setting, and participants:   A combined decision tree and Markov model for men with elevated prostate-specific antigen (>4 ng/ml) was developed. Input data were derived from systematic literature searches, meta-analyses, and expert opinion.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and health care costs of both strategies were modelled over 10 yr after initial suspicion of PCa. Probabilistic and threshold analyses were performed to assess uncertainty.  Results and limitations:   Despite uncertainty around the presented cost-effectiveness estimates, our results suggest that the MRI strategy is cost-effective compared with the standard of care. Expected costs per patient were € 2423 for the MRI strategy and € 2392 for the TRUSGB strategy. Corresponding QALYs were higher for the MRI strategy (7.00 versus 6.90), resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of € 323 per QALY. Threshold analysis revealed that MRI is cost-effective when sensitivity of MRGB is ≥ 20%. The probability that the MRI strategy is cost-effective is around 80% at willingness to pay thresholds higher than € 2000 per QALY.  Conclusions:   Total costs of the MRI strategy are almost equal with the standard of care, while reduction of overdiagnosis and overtreatment with the MRI strategy leads to an improvement in quality of life.  Patient summary:   We compared costs and quality of life (QoL) of the standard ""blind"" diagnostic technique with an image-based technique for men with suspicion of prostate cancer.

An in-house library of compounds tested on PRK1 was docked into the ATP binding site of the generated models. In most cases a correct pose of the inhibitors could be identified by ensemble docking, while there is still a challenge of finding a reasonable scoring function that is able to rank compounds according to their biological activity. We estimated the binding free energy for our data set of structurally diverse PRK1 inhibitors using the MM-PB(GB)SA and QM/MM-GBSA methods. The obtained results demonstrate that a correlation between calculated binding free energies and experimental IC50 values was found to be usually higher than using docking scores. Furthermore, the developed approach was tested on a set of diverse PRK1 inhibitors taken from literature, which resulted in a significant correlation.

The present study compared the anticancer effects of PGJ2 on estrogen receptor alpha (ERα)-positive (MCF-7) and ERα-negative (MDA-MB-231) human breast cancer cells. Based on the reported signalling cross-talk between PPARγ and ERα, the effect of the ERα ligand, 17β-estradiol (E2) on the anticancer activities of PGJ2 in both types of cells was also explored. Here we report that PGJ2 inhibited proliferation of both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells by inducing apoptotic cell death with active involvement of mitochondria. The presence of E2 potentiated PGJ2-induced apoptosis in MCF-7, but not in MDA-MB-231 cells. The PPARγ antagonist, GW9662, failed to block PGJ2-induced activities but potentiated its effects in MCF-7 cells, instead. Interestingly, GW9662 also proved capable of inducing apoptotic cell death.

MeOH-PYO-PRE was the most cytotoxic and inhibited HepG2 cell growth more than that of LNCaP cells but was not toxic to NIH3T3 cells. When PREs were combined with paclitaxel or vinblastine, they showed additive cytotoxic effects on HepG2 and LNCaP cells, except for MeOH-PYO-PRE which showed synergistic effects on HepG2 cells when combined with vinblastine.

However, this is still in the pioneering stage considering the challenging nature of the surgical procedures. We have therefore focused on reduced port surgery, using only 2-ports. In this study, we compared 2-port laparoendoscopic radical prostatectomy (2-port RP) and conventional 5-port laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (LRP) for clinically localized prostate carcinoma and evaluated the potential advantages of each.  Materials and methods:   From January 2010 to December 2010, all 23 patients with clinically localized prostate cancer underwent LRP. Starting November, 2010, when we introduced the reduced port approach, we performed this procedure for 22 consecutive patients diagnosed with early-stage prostate cancer (cT1c, cT2N0). The patients were matched 1:1 to 2-port RP or LRP for age, preoperative serum PSA level, clinical stage, biopsy and pathological Gleason grade, surgical margin status, pad-free rates and post-operative pain.  Results:   There was a significant difference in operative time between the 2-port RP and LRP groups (286.5 ± 63.3 and 351.8 ± 72.4 min: p=0.0019, without any variation in blood loss (including urine) (945.1 ± 479.6 vs 1271.1 ± 871.8 ml: p=0.13). The Foley catheter indwelling period was shorter in the 2 port RP group, but without significance (5.6 ± 1.8 vs 8.0 ± 5.6 days: p=0.057) and the total perioperative complication rates for 2 port RP and LRP were comparable at 4.5% and 8.7% (p=0.58). There was an improvement in pad-free rates up to 6 months follow-up (p=0.090), and significantly improvement at 1 year (p=0.040). PSA recurrence was 1 (4.5%) in 2-port RP and 2 (8.7%) in LRP. Continuous epidural anesthesia was used in most of LRP patients (95.7%) and in early 2-port RP patients (40.9%). In these patients, average total amount of Diclofenac sodium was 27.8 mg/patient in 2-port RP and 50.0mg/patient in LRP.  Conclusions:   Thus the reduced port approach is as efficacious as LRP in terms of many outcome measures, with significant cosmetic advantages and reduction in post surgical pain. This method can be readily performed safely and therefore can be recommended as a standard laparoscopic surgery for prostate cancer in the future.""","""['Hidetoshi Akita', 'Akihiro Nakane', 'Ryosuke Ando', 'Kenji Yamada', 'Takahiro Kobayashi', 'Takehiko Okamura', 'Kejiro Kohri']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Asian Pac J Cancer Prev""","""['Feasibility of a novel extraperitoneal two-port laparoendoscopic approach for radical prostatectomy: an initial study.', 'Propensity score comparison of the various radical surgical techniques for high-risk prostate cancer.', 'Retrospective study of laparoscopic radical prostatectomy for localized prostate cancer after transurethral resection of the prostate compared with retropubic radical prostatectomy at the same institution.', 'Comparison of perioperative, functional, and oncologic outcomes between standard laparoscopic and robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy: a systemic review and meta-analysis.', 'Long-term oncological outcomes after laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.']"""

In this study, we are developing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques that provide therapy monitoring and early assessment of tumor response to PDT. We generated human prostate cancer xenografts in athymic nude mice. For the imaging experiments, we used a high-field 9.4-T small animal MR scanner (Bruker Biospec). High-resolution MR images were acquired from the treated and control tumors pre- and post-PDT and 24 hr after PDT. We utilized multi-slice multi-echo (MSME) MR sequences. During imaging acquisitions, the animals were anesthetized with a continuous supply of 2% isoflurane in oxygen and were continuously monitored for respiration and temperature. After imaging experiments, we manually segmented the tumors on each image slice for quantitative image analyses. We computed three-dimensional T2 maps for the tumor regions from the MSME images. We plotted the histograms of the T2 maps for each tumor pre- and post-PDT and 24 hr after PDT. After the imaging and PDT experiments, we dissected the tumor tissues and used the histologic slides to validate the MR images. In this study, six mice with human prostate cancer tumors were imaged and treated at the Case Center for Imaging Research. The T2 values of treated tumors increased by 24 ± 14% 24 hr after the therapy. The control tumors did not demonstrate significant changes of the T2 values. Inflammation and necrosis were observed within the treated tumors 24 hour after the treatment. Preliminary results show that Pc 4-PDT is effective for the treatment of human prostate cancer in mice.

To date, many studies have examined the association between CYP1A1 MspI and Ile462Val polymorphisms and cancer risk in various populations, but their results have been conflicting rather than consistent.  Methods:   To assess this relationship more precisely, a meta-analysis based on 198 publications was performed. Odds ratios (OR) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to assess the association. The statistical heterogeneity across studies was examined with a chi-square-based Q-test.  Results:   Overall, a significant elevated risk of cancer was associated with CYP1A1 MspI and Ile462Val polymorphisms for all genetic models studied. Further stratified analysis by cancer types revealed that the MspI polymorphism may increase the risk of lung cancer and cervical cancer whereas the Ile462Val polymorphism may contribute to a higher risk of lung cancer, leukemia, esophageal carcinoma, and prostate cancer. In the subgroup analysis by ethnicity, obvious associations were found in the Asian population for the MspI polymorphism while an increased risk of cancer was observed in Asians and Caucasians for the Ile462Val polymorphism.  Conclusions:   The results of this meta-analysis suggest that CYP1A1 MspI and Ile462Val polymorphisms contribute to increased cancer susceptibility among Asians. Additional comprehensive system analyses are required to validate this association and other related polymorphisms.""","""['Bin Wu', 'Kang Liu', 'Huaxing Huang', 'Jun Yuan', 'Wanqing Yuan', 'Shangqian Wang', 'Tingting Chen', 'Hu Zhao', 'Changjun Yin']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['The cytochrome P4501A1 gene polymorphisms and endometriosis: a meta-analysis.', 'CYP1A1 MspI and exon7 gene polymorphisms and lung cancer risk: an updated meta-analysis and review.', 'The effect of CYP1A1 polymorphisms on the risk of lung cancer: a global meta-analysis based on 71 case-control studies.', 'CYP1A1 MspI polymorphism is associated with prostate cancer susceptibility: evidence from a meta-analysis.', 'Does cytochrome P450 1A1 MspI polymorphism increase acute lymphoblastic leukemia risk?

Recent evidence has shown that miRNAs target entire functionally related proteins such as protein complexes and biological pathways. However, characterizing the influence of miRNAs on genes whose encoded proteins are part of protein complexes has not been studied in the context of disease. We propose an entropy-based framework to identify miRNA-mediated dysregulation of functionally related proteins during prostate cancer progression. The proposed framework uses experimentally verified miRNA-target interactions, functionally related proteins and expression data to identify miRNA-influenced protein complexes in prostate cancer, and identify genes that are dysregulated as a result. The framework constructs correlation matrixes between functionally related proteins and miRNAs that have targets in the complex, and assesses the changes in the Shannon entropy of the modules across different stages of prostate cancer. Results reveal that SMAD4 and HDAC containing protein complexes are highly affected and disrupted by miRNAs, particularly miRNA-1 and miRNA-16. Using biological pathways to define functionally related proteins reveals that NF-kB-, RAS-, and Syndecan-mediated pathways are dysregulated due to miRNA-1- and miRNA-16-mediated regulation. These results suggest that miRNA-1 and miRNA-16 are important master regulators of miRNA-mediated regulation in prostate cancer. Moreover, results reveal that miRNAs with high-influence on the disrupted protein complexes are diagnostic and prognostic biomarker candidates for prostate cancer progression. The observation of miRNA-mediated protein complex regulation and miRNA-mediated pathway regulation, with partial experimental verification from previous studies, demonstrates that our framework is a promising approach for the identification of novel miRNAs and protein complexes related to disease progression.""","""['Mohammed Alshalalfa', 'Gary D Bader', 'Tarek A Bismar', 'Reda Alhajj']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Detecting microRNAs of high influence on protein functional interaction networks: a prostate cancer case study.', 'miRNA-mRNA correlation-network modules in human prostate cancer and the differences between primary and metastatic tumor subtypes.', 'miR-888 is an expressed prostatic secretions-derived microRNA that promotes prostate cell growth and migration.', 'Recent scenario of microRNA as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers of prostate cancer.', 'MicroRNAs in prostate cancer: Functional role as biomarkers.', 'The Role of Nucleases Cleaving TLR3, TLR7/8 and TLR9 Ligands, Dicer RNase and miRNA/piRNA Proteins in Functional Adaptation to the Immune Escape and Xenophagy of Prostate Cancer Tissue.', 'ceRNA crosstalk stabilizes protein expression and affects the correlation pattern of interacting proteins.', 'A statistically inferred microRNA network identifies breast cancer target miR-940 as an actin cytoskeleton regulator.', 'Polymorphism in miRNA-1 target site and circulating miRNA-1 phenotype are associated with the decreased risk and prognosis of coronary artery disease.', 'Regulation of human growth hormone receptor expression by microRNAs.']"""

First, conventionally fractionated radiation therapy decreased tumor cell proliferation and increased cell death with kinetics comparable to human prostate cancer radiotherapy. Secondly, the injection of Hoechst 33342 or fluorescent-dextrans showed an increased tumor perfusion within 14 days in irradiated tumors, which was correlated with a clear reduction of hypoxia.

Therefore, novel biomarkers are needed. Unfortunately, the complexity of body fluids often hampers biomarker discovery. An attractive alternative approach is the isolation of small vesicles, i.e. exosomes, ∼100 nm, which contain proteins that are specific to the tissue from which they are derived and therefore can be considered as treasure chests for disease-specific biomarker discovery.  Materials and methods:   Exosomes were isolated from 2 immortalized primary prostate epithelial cells (PNT2C2 and RWPE-1) and 2 PCa cell lines (PC346C and VCaP) by ultracentrifugation. After tryptic digestion, proteomic analyses utilized a nanoLC coupled with an LTQ-Orbitrap operated in tandem MS (MS/MS) mode. Accurate Mass and Time (AMT) tag approach was employed for peptide identification and quantitation. Candidate biomarkers were validated by Western blotting and Immunohistochemistry.  Results:   Proteomic characterization resulted in the identification of 248, 233, 169, and 216 proteins by at least 2 peptides in exosomes from PNT2C2, RWPE-1, PC346C, and VCaP, respectively. Statistical analyses revealed 52 proteins differently abundant between PCa and control cells, 9 of which were more abundant in PCa. Validation by Western blotting confirmed a higher abundance of FASN, XPO1 and PDCD6IP (ALIX) in PCa exosomes.

Methods:   A 21-question survey was sent through SurveyMonkey to members of the American Society of Radiation Oncology.  Results:   A total of 999 ROs responded. Threshold rPSA values to initiate SRT ranged from 0.1 to 1 ng/mL. The highest dose prescribed by ROs ranged from <60 to >70.2 Gy.

Methods:   Initial therapy for 8229 nonmetastatic prostate cancer cases diagnosed in 2004 from cancer registries in 7 states was abstracted as part of the Centers for Disease Control's Patterns of Care Breast and Prostate Cancer study conducted during 2007 to 2009.

A multivariable model was used to determine risk factors associated with receipt of nonguideline-concordant care.  Results:   Nearly 80% with nonmetastatic prostate cancer received guideline-concordant care for initial therapy. Receipt of nonguideline-concordant care (including receiving either less aggressive therapy or more aggressive therapy than indicated) was related to older age, African American race/ethnicity, being unmarried, rural residence, and especially to being in the high recurrence risk group where receiving less aggressive therapy than indicated occurred more often than receiving more aggressive therapy (adjusted OR=4.2; 95% CL, 3.5-5.2 vs. low-risk group). Compared with life table estimates adjusted for comorbidity, physicians tended to underestimate LE.  Conclusions:   Receipt of less aggressive therapy than indicated among high-risk group men with >5-year LE based on life table estimates adjusted for comorbidity was a concern. Physicians may tend to underestimate 5-year survival among this group and should be alerted to the importance of recommending aggressive therapy when warranted. However, based on more recent guidelines, among those with low-risk disease, the proportion considered to be receiving less aggressive therapy than indicated may now be lower because active surveillance is now considered appropriate.""","""['Ann S Hamilton', 'Steven T Fleming', 'Dian Wang', 'Michael Goodman', 'Xiao-Cheng Wu', 'Jean B Owen', 'Mary Lo', 'Alex Ho', 'Roger T Anderson', 'Trevor Thompson']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Am J Clin Oncol""","""['Race/ethnicity and the receipt of watchful waiting for the initial management of prostate cancer.', 'Receipt of National Comprehensive Cancer Network guideline-concordant prostate cancer care among African American and Caucasian American men in North Carolina.', 'Influence of Age on Guideline-Concordant Cancer Care for Elderly Patients in the United States.', 'Management of localised prostate cancer: watchful waiting, surgery or radiation therapy, depending on the natural course, which is often relatively slow.', 'Active surveillance of prostate cancer in African American men.', 'Adherence to Treatment Guidelines and Associated Survival in Older Patients with Prostate Cancer: A Prospective Multicentre Cohort Study.', 'Increased curative treatment is associated with decreased prostate cancer-specific and overall mortality in senior adults with high-risk prostate cancer; results from a national registry-based cohort study.', 'Examining Urban and Rural Differences in How Distance to Care Influences the Initiation and Completion of Treatment among Insured Cervical Cancer Patients.', 'Evaluating the urban-rural paradox: The complicated relationship between distance and the receipt of guideline-concordant care among cervical cancer patients.', 'The Role of Provider Characteristics in the Selection of Surgery or Radiation for Localized Prostate Cancer and Association With Quality of Care Indicators.']"""

Immunohistochemical stains showed a phenotype consistent with a primary lung tumor (ie, TTF1+/CK7+), with negative results for other markers. Molecular analysis in six cases showed that none harbored an EGFR-activating mutation. KRAS mutation was detected in one case, and an ALK1 and ROS1 gene rearrangement were each detected in an additional two cases.

Molecular imaging of FSHR is beneficial for prognosis and therapy of cancer. FSHβ(33-53) (YTRDLVYKDPARPKIQKTCTF), denoted as FSH1, is a FSHR antagonist. In the present study, maleimide-NOTA conjugate of FSH1 (NOTA-MAL-FSH1) was designed and labeled with [(18)F] aluminum fluoride. The resulting tracer, (18)F-Al-NOTA-MAL-FSH1, was preliminarily evaluated in PET imaging of FSHR-positive tumor.  Procedures:   NOTA-MAL-FSH1 was synthesized and radiolabeled with Al(18)F complex. The tumor-targeting potential and pharmacokinetic profile of the (18)F-labeled compound were evaluated in vitro and in vivo using a PC3 human prostate tumor model.  Results:   (18)F-Al-NOTA-MAL-FSH1 can be efficiently produced within 30 min with a non-decay-corrected yield of 48.6 ± 2.1 % and a radiochemical purity of more than 95 %. The specific activity was at least 30 GBq/μmol. The radiotracer was stable in phosphate-buffered saline and human serum for at least 2 h. The IC50 values of displacement (18)F-Al-NOTA-MAL-FSH1 with FSH1 were 252 ± 1.12 nM. The PC3 human prostate tumor xenografts were clearly visible with high contrast after injection of (18)F-Al-NOTA-MAL-FSH1 via microPET. At 30, 60 and 120 min postinjection, the tumor uptakes were 2.98 ± 0.29 % injected dose (ID)/g, 2.53 ± 0.20 %ID/g and 1.36 ± 0.12 %ID/g, respectively. Dynamic PET scanning showed that tumor uptake reached a plateau by about 6 min. Heart peaked earlier and then cleared quickly. Biodistribution studies confirmed that the normal organs except kidney uptakes were all below 1 %ID/g at 1 h p.i. The tumor-to-blood and tumor-to-muscle ratio at 10 min, 0.5, 1, and 2 h after injection were 1.64 ± 0.36, 2.97 ± 0.40, 9.31 ± 1.06, and 13.59 ± 2.33 and 7.05 ± 1.10, 10.10 ± 1.48, 16.17 ± 3.29, and 30.88 ± 4.67, respectively. The tracer was excreted mainly through the renal system, as evidenced by high levels of radioactivity in the kidneys. FSHR-binding specificity was also demonstrated by reduced tumor uptake of (18)F-Al-NOTA-MAL-FSH1 after coinjection with an excess of unlabeled FSH1 peptide.  Conclusion:   NOTA-MAL-FSH1 could be labeled rapidly and efficiently with (18)F using one step method.

Methods:   Using data from two large US health systems, we identified all patients aged ≥ 18 years with primary BC, LC, or PC and newly diagnosed BM between 1/1/1995 and 12/31/2009. Starting with the diagnosis of BM, we reviewed medical and administrative records for evidence of receipt of IV bisphosphonates (zoledronic acid or pamidronate) and occurrence of SREs. Initiation of IV bisphosphonates prior to occurrence of an SRE was designated ""primary prophylaxis""; use following an SRE was designated ""secondary prophylaxis"".  Results:   We identified a total of 1,193 patients with newly diagnosed BM, including 400 with BC, 332 with LC, and 461 with PC. Use of IV bisphosphonates was substantially higher in BC (55.8 % of all patients) than in LC (14.8 %) or PC (20.2 %). Use of IV bisphosphonates was fairly evenly split between primary and secondary prophylaxis in BC (26.3 vs. 29.5 %, respectively) and PC (10.6 vs 9.5 %); in LC, however, primary prophylaxis was much less common than secondary prophylaxis (4.8 vs 9.9 %).  Conclusions:   Almost one half of all patients with BM due to BC, and substantially more with LC and PC, do not receive IV bisphosphonates.

Purpose:   To examine cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between light-intensity activity and physical function in older cancer survivors at increased risk for age- and treatment-related comorbidities, including accelerated functional decline.  Methods:   The analysis included data from 641 breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer survivors (54% female) age 65 yr and older who participated in a 1-yr home-based diet and exercise intervention designed to reduce the rate of physical function decline. ANCOVA was used to compare means of physical function across levels of PA intensity (low-light [LLPA]: 1.5-2.0 METs; high-light [HLPA]: 2.1-2.9 METs; MVPA: ≥3.0 METs).  Results:   In cross-sectional analyses, increasing tertiles of light-intensity activity were associated with higher scores for all three measures of physical function (all P values <0.005), after adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, comorbidity, symptoms, and MVPA. Associations were stronger for HLPA than for LLPA. Compared with survivors who had decreased MVPA or maintained stable MVPA and HLPA at the postintervention follow-up, those who had increased HLPA, but had decreased MVPA or maintained stable MVPA, reported higher physical function scores (LS means [95% confidence interval]: SF-36 Physical Function Subscale: -5.58 [-7.96 to -3.20] vs -2.54 [-5.83 to 0.75], P = 0.14; Basic Lower Extremity Function: -2.00 [-3.45 to -0.55] vs 0.28 [-1.72 to 2.28], P = 0.07; Advanced Lower Extremity Function: -2.58 [-4.00 to -1.15] vs 0.44 [-1.52 to 2.40], P = 0.01).

We then investigated the methylation status of the gene promoter and determined the cellular responses of PC3 and LNCaP after transfection with β-hexosaminidase α subunit. We found that each prostate cancer cell line had a decrease in total hexosaminidase activity and that the lack of hexosaminidase A activity, observed in PC3 and LNCaP cells, was associated with mRNA disappearance. The HEXA promoter region in LNCaP and PC3 cell lines had methylated CpG islands, as confirmed by 5'-Aza-2'-deoxycitidine treatment, in PC3 cells, used as cell cancer model.

Notably, the action of decorin in regulating the IGF-I system differs between normal and transformed cells. In normal cells, decorin binds with high affinity to both the natural ligand IGF-I and the IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR) and positively regulates IGF-IR activation and downstream signaling. In contrast, in transformed cells, decorin negatively regulates ligand-induced IGF-IR activation, downstream signaling and IGF-IR-dependent biological responses. Whether decorin may bind another member of the IGF-I system, the insulin receptor A isoform (IR-A) and its cognate ligands, insulin, IGF-II and proinsulin, have not been established. Here we show that decorin bound with high affinity insulin and IGF-II and, to a lesser extent, proinsulin and IR-A. We utilized as a cell model system mouse embryonic fibroblasts homozygous for a targeted disruption of the Igf1r gene (designated R(-) cells) which were stably transfected with a human construct harboring the IR-A isoform of the receptor. Using these R(-)/IR-A cells, we demonstrate that decorin did not affect ligand-induced phosphorylation of the IR-A but enhanced IR-A downregulation after prolonged IGF-II stimulation without affecting insulin and proinsulin-dependent effects on IR-A stability. In addition, decorin significantly inhibited IGF-II-mediated activation of the Akt pathways, without affecting insulin and proinsulin-dependent signaling. Notably, decorin significantly inhibited IGF-II-mediated cell proliferation of R(-)/IR-A cells but affected neither insulin- nor proinsulin-dependent mitogenesis. Collectively, these results suggest that decorin differentially regulates the action of IR-A ligands.

We sought to determine the access, imaging protocols, and indications for MRI imaging of the prostate in the United States.  Methods:   A brief survey was sent through mailing lists to members of the Society of Abdominal Radiology and Texas Radiological Society.  Results:   Thirty-six academic centers responded to the survey, 88.9% of which routinely perform prostate MRI. Nine centers routinely performed imaging at 1.5T with an endorectal coil (25%), 11 performed at 3.0T without an endorectal coil (31%), and 10 performed at 3.0T with an endorectal coil (28%). All institutions used T1-weighted axial and orthogonal T2-weighted sequences. Most groups used diffusion-weighted imaging (94.7%) and dynamic contrast enhancement (81.6%). Only 21.1% of groups performing prostate MRI routinely performed MR spectroscopy as part of their protocol.  Conclusions:   Prostate MRI is becoming a commonly performed examination at academic institutions, with most locations performing prostate MRI at minimum standards. There is a need to educate nonacademic practices regarding the addition of functional MRI techniques to anatomic techniques, increase the number of institutions that regularly perform prostate MRI, and increase access to direct MRI-guided biopsy in institutions that perform prostate MRI on a regular basis.""","""['James L Leake', 'Rulon Hardman', 'Vijayanadh Ojili', 'Ian Thompson', 'Alampady Shanbhogue', 'Javier Hernandez', 'Jelle Barentsz']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Am Coll Radiol""","""['Practice Patterns and Challenges of Performing and Interpreting Prostate MRI: A Survey by the Society of Abdominal Radiology Prostate Disease-Focused Panel.', 'Current beliefs and practice patterns among urologists regarding prostate magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance-targeted biopsy.', 'Current practice and access to prostate MR imaging in France.', 'The diagnostic accuracy and cost-effectiveness of magnetic resonance spectroscopy and enhanced magnetic resonance imaging techniques in aiding the localisation of prostate abnormalities for biopsy: a systematic review and economic evaluation.', 'The role of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in focal therapy for prostate cancer: recommendations from a consensus panel.', 'MAS-UNet: a U-shaped network for prostate segmentation.', 'Joint Cancer Segmentation and PI-RADS Classification on Multiparametric MRI Using MiniSegCaps Network.', 'Prostate imaging features on magnetic resonance imaging of young patients.', 'Prostate MRI using a rigid two-channel phased-array endorectal coil: comparison with phased array coil acquisition at 3\u2009T.', 'Machine Learning in Prostate MRI for Prostate Cancer: Current Status and Future Opportunities.']"""

The system consisted of a salt bridge-linked reaction cell and a capacitor/DMM-joined electronic circuit. A sandwich-type immunoreaction with target PSA between the immobilized primary antibody and glucose oxidase (GOx)-labeled detection antibody was initially carried out in one of the two half-cells. Accompanying the sandwiched immunocomplex, the conjugated GOx could catalyze the oxidation of glucose, simultaneously resulting in the conversion of [Fe(CN)6](3-) to [Fe(CN)6](4-). The difference in the concentrations of [Fe(CN)6](3-)/[Fe(CN)6](4-) in two half-cells automatically produced a voltage that was utilized to charge an external capacitor. With the closing circuit switch, the capacitor discharged through the DMM, which could provide a high instantaneous current. Under the optimal conditions, the resulting currents was indirectly proportional to the concentration of target PSA in the dynamic range of 0.05-7 ng mL(-1) with a detection limit (LOD) of 6 pg mL(-1). The reproducibility, precision, and selectivity were acceptable. In addition, the methodology was validated by analyzing 12 clinical serum specimens, receiving a good accordance with the referenced values for the detection of PSA.""","""['Dianping Tang', 'Bing Zhang', 'Bingqian Liu', 'Guonan Chen', 'Minghua Lu']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Biosens Bioelectron""","""['Enzymatic Oxydate-Triggered Self-Illuminated Photoelectrochemical Sensing Platform for Portable Immunoassay Using Digital Multimeter.', 'Ultrasensitive electrochemical immunosensor for PSA biomarker detection in prostate cancer cells using gold nanoparticles/PAMAM dendrimer loaded with enzyme linked aptamer as integrated triple signal amplification strategy.', 'Simultaneous immobilization of glucose oxidase on the surface and cavity of hollow gold nanospheres as labels for highly sensitive electrochemical immunoassay of tumor marker.', 'Early detection of prostate cancer: is PSA a reliable option?', 'Prostate-specific antigen as a tumor marker of prostate carcinoma.', 'Capacitive biosensor based on vertically paired electrodes for the detection of SARS-CoV-2.']"""

The SERPINA5 was reported to be deregulated in renal, breast, prostate and ovarian cancers. However, the roles of SERPINA5 in cancer remain greatly elusive. In this study, we found that the DNA dosage and expression level of the SERPINA5 gene were significantly decreased in HCC by quantitative real-time PCR. Notably, the expression levels of SERPINA5 negatively correlated with malignant progression of HCC. The SERPINA5 gene was further observed to reduce in vitro and in vivo metastatic potential of HCC cells. Moreover, secreted SERPINA5 protein also could inhibit the metastatic ability of HCC cells. Finally, we discovered that one of the mechanisms explaining SERPINA5 inhibition of HCC metastasis is through direct interaction with fibronectin and disruption of the fibronectin-integrin signaling pathway.

The aim of the present study was to determine whether such therapy can be improved by combining docetaxel with Aneustat (OMN54), a multivalent botanical drug candidate shown to have anti-prostate cancer activity in preliminary in vitro experiments, which is currently undergoing a Phase-I Clinical Trial. Human metastatic, androgen-independent C4-2 prostate cancer cells and NOD-SCID mice bearing PTEN-deficient, metastatic and PSA-secreting, patient-derived subrenal capsule LTL-313H prostate cancer tissue xenografts were treated with docetaxel and Aneustat, alone and in combination. In vitro, Aneustat markedly inhibited C4-2 cell replication in a dose-dependent manner. When Aneustat was combined with docetaxel, the growth inhibitions of the drugs were essentially additive. In vivo, however, the combination of docetaxel and Aneustat enhanced anti-tumor activity synergistically and very markedly, without inducing major host toxicity. Complete growth inhibition and shrinkage of the xenografts could be obtained with the combined drugs as distinct from the drugs on their own. Analysis of the gene expression of the xenografts using microarray indicated that docetaxel + Aneustat led to expanded anticancer activity, in particular to targeting of cancer hallmarks that were not affected by the single drugs. Our findings, obtained with a highly clinically relevant prostate cancer model, suggest, for the first time, that docetaxel-based therapy of advanced human prostate cancer may be improved by combining docetaxel with Aneustat.""","""['Sifeng Qu', 'Kendric Wang', 'Hui Xue', 'Yuwei Wang', 'Rebecca Wu', 'Chengfei Liu', 'Allen C Gao', 'Peter W Gout', 'Colin C Collins', 'Yuzhuo Wang']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Mol Oncol""","""['Treatment with docetaxel in combination with Aneustat leads to potent inhibition of metastasis in a patient-derived xenograft model of advanced prostate cancer.', 'Aneustat (OMN54) has aerobic glycolysis-inhibitory activity and also immunomodulatory activity as indicated by a first-generation PDX prostate cancer model.', 'Antitumor and antimetastatic activities of docetaxel are enhanced by genistein through regulation of osteoprotegerin/receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB (RANK)/RANK ligand/MMP-9 signaling in prostate cancer.', 'Taxane-based Combination Therapies for Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'The potential of DMXAA (ASA404) in combination with docetaxel in advanced prostate cancer.', 'Synergistic effects of natural products in combination with anticancer agents in prostate cancer: A scoping review.', 'Patient-derived xenograft models in hepatopancreatobiliary cancer.', 'Targeting treatment options for castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Development of patient-derived xenograft models of prostate cancer for maintaining tumor heterogeneity.', 'Systematic Review of Patient-Derived Xenograft Models for Preclinical Studies of Anti-Cancer Drugs in Solid Tumors.']"""

A model that assesses the risk of ECE in the specimen considering the clinical, histological and imaging findings is defined.  Material and methods:   prospective study in 85 patients with prostate cancer treated with radical prostatectomy. Prostate biopsy was performed 4 weeks before multiparametric study (mpMRI). mpMRI included T2-weighted endorectal magnetic resonance imaging (T2W-MRI), diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) and dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI). The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) was also measured. A study of consistency (k) was assessed comparing receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and area under the curve (AUC), which were obtained in each case (Z). Finally, a regression model was performed to predict ECE.  Results:   the mean age was 63.7 ± 6.9 years and the mean value of PSA 12.6 ± 13.8. In 31.7% of cases, digital rectal examination was suspicious for malignancy. Prostatectomy specimen showed pT2a in 12 cases (14%), pT2b in 3 (3%), pT2c in 37 (43%), pT3a in 19(22%) and pT3b 14 cases (17%). ECE was evidenced in 33 (39%) of the specimens, seminal vesicle invasion in 14 (16.5%) and pelvic node involvement in 5 patients (6%). The consistency in the evaluation of ECE (image and pathological studies) was .35 for MRI (sensitivity .33, specificity .96) and .62 for mpMRI (sensitivity .58, specificity .98). Mean value of ADC was .76 ± .2 in patients with ECE. This value was not associated with Gleason score (P = .2) or with PSA value (P = .6). AUC value as predictor of ECE was of 65% for MRI, 78% for mpMRI and 50% ADC (Z = .008). Univariate analysis demonstrated that ECE probability increases with each Gleason score point, whilst this probability increases 1.06 times with each PSA point, and decreases .3 times with each point of ADC. Multivariate analysis confirmed that ADC value is a slight protective factor against ECE (OR = .01; CI 95% .002-.14). The consistency in the evaluation of seminal vesicles was .43 for MRI and .67 for mpMRI. AUC was 69% and 82% respectively (Z = .02). The consistency in the evaluation of positive lymph nodes was .4 for MRI and .7 for mpMRI. AUC was 68% and 88% respectively (Z = .36).

However, the mechanism remains largely unclear.  Methods:   Lung cancer cells were treated with parthenolide and the cell lysates were prepared to detect the given proteins by Western Blot analysis, and the cell survival was assayed by SRB and MTT assay. Cell cycle was evaluated by DNA flow cytometry analysis. TNFRSF10B, PMAIP1, ATF4 and DDIT3 genes were knocked down by siRNA technique. Apoptosis was evaluated by using Annexin V-FITC/PI staining and flow cytometry analysis.  Results:   Parthenolide (PTL) induces apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in human lung cancer cells. Moreover, PTL treatment in NSCLC cells increases expression of TNFRSF10B/DR5 and PMAIP1/NOXA. Silencing of TNFRSF10B or PMAIP1 or overexpression of CFLAR /c-FLIP (long form) could protect cells from PTL-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, PTL could increase the levels of endoplasmic reticulum stress hallmarks such as ERN1, HSPA5, p-EIF2A, ATF4 and DDIT3. Knockdown of ATF4 and DDIT3 abrogated PTL-induced apoptosis, which suggested that PTL induced apoptosis in NSCLC cells through activation of endoplasmic reticulum stress pathway. More importantly, we found that ATF4, DDIT3, TNFRSF10B and PMAIP1 were up-regulated more intensively, while CFLAR and MCL1 were down-regulated more dramatically by PTL in A549/shCDH1 cells than that in control cells, suggesting that PTL preferred to kill cancer stem cell-like cells by activating more intensive ER stress response in cancer stem cell-like cells.  Conclusion:   We showed that parthenolide not only triggered extrinsic apoptosis by up-regulating TNFRSF10B and down-regulating CFLAR, but also induced intrinsic apoptosis through increasing the expression of PMAIP1 and decreasing the level of MCL1 in NSCLC cells. In addition, parthenolide triggered stronger ER stress response in cancer stem cell-like cells which leads to its preference in apoptotic induction. In summary, PTL induces apoptosis in NSCLC cells by activating endoplasmic reticulum stress response.""","""['Xiaofei Zhao', 'Xiangguo Liu', 'Ling Su']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Exp Clin Cancer Res""","""['DDIT3 and KAT2A Proteins Regulate TNFRSF10A and TNFRSF10B Expression in Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress-mediated Apoptosis in Human Lung Cancer Cells.', 'Active mixture of serum-circulating small molecules selectively inhibits proliferation and triggers apoptosis in cancer cells via induction of ER stress.', 'Salermide up-regulates death receptor 5 expression through the ATF4-ATF3-CHOP axis and leads to apoptosis in human cancer cells.', 'Down-regulation of intracellular anti-apoptotic proteins, particularly c-FLIP by therapeutic agents; the novel view to overcome resistance to TRAIL.', 'The Emerging Potential of Parthenolide Nanoformulations in Tumor Therapy.', 'Bioactive Phytoconstituents and Their Therapeutic Potentials in the Treatment of Haematological Cancers: A Review.', 'Trends in parthenolide research over the past two decades: A bibliometric analysis.', 'Bioinformatics Analysis of the Prognostic Significance of VPS16 in Hepatocellular Carcinoma and Its Role in Drug Screening.', 'New Visions on Natural Products and Cancer Therapy: Autophagy and Related Regulatory Pathways.', 'Extracellular vesicles from gastric epithelial GES-1 cells infected with Helicobacter pylori promote changes in recipient cells associated with malignancy.']"""

Methods:   Using a simplified model of prostate cancer focal target, and focal laser ablation region shapes, Monte Carlo simulations of needle placement error were performed to estimate the probability of completely ablating a region of target tissue.  Results:   Graphs of the probability of complete focal target ablation are presented over clinically relevant ranges of focal target sizes and shapes, ablation region sizes, and levels of needle placement uncertainty. In addition, a table is provided for estimating the maximum target size that is treatable. The results predict that targets whose length is at least 5 mm smaller than the diameter of each ablation region can be confidently ablated using, at most, four laser fibers if the standard deviation in each component of needle placement error is less than 3 mm. However, targets larger than this (i.e., near to or exceeding the diameter of each ablation region) require more careful planning. This process is facilitated by using the table provided.  Conclusions:   The probability of completely ablating a focal target using FLA is sensitive to the level of needle placement uncertainty, especially as the target length approaches and becomes greater than the diameter of ablated tissue that each individual laser fiber can achieve. The results of this work can be used to help determine individual patient eligibility for prostate FLA, to guide the planning of prostate FLA, and to quantify the clinical benefit of using advanced systems for accurate needle delivery for this treatment modality.""","""['Jeremy Cepek', 'Uri Lindner', 'Sean R H Davidson', 'Masoom A Haider', 'Sangeet Ghai', 'John Trachtenberg', 'Aaron Fenster']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Toward mechatronic MRI-guided focal laser ablation of the prostate: Robust registration for improved needle delivery.', 'Evaluation of tumor coverage after MR-guided prostate focal laser ablation therapy.', 'Design and validation of an MRI-compatible mechatronic system for needle delivery to localized prostate cancer.', 'Focal laser ablation as clinical treatment of prostate cancer: report from a Delphi consensus project.', 'Target ablation--image-guided therapy in prostate cancer.', 'Optimization of laser dosimetry based on patient-specific anatomical models for the ablation of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma tumor.', 'MRI-Guided Robotically Assisted Focal Laser Ablation of the Prostate Using Canine Cadavers.', 'MRI-guided biopsies and minimally invasive therapy for prostate cancer.']"""

In this study the authors convert MRI intensity values into Hounsfield units (HUs) in the male pelvis and thus enable accurate MRI-based RTP for prostate cancer patients with varying tissue anatomy and body fat contents.  Methods:   T1/T2*-weighted MRI intensity values and standard computed tomography (CT) image HUs in the male pelvis were analyzed using image data of 10 prostate cancer patients. The collected data were utilized to generate a dual model HU conversion technique from MRI intensity values of the single image set separately within and outside of contoured pelvic bones. Within the bone segment local MRI intensity values were converted to HUs by applying a second-order polynomial model. This model was tuned for each patient by two patient-specific adjustments: MR signal normalization to correct shifts in absolute intensity level and application of a cutoff value to accurately represent low density bony tissue HUs. For soft tissues, such as fat and muscle, located outside of the bone contours, a threshold-based segmentation method without requirements for any patient-specific adjustments was introduced to convert MRI intensity values into HUs. The dual model HU conversion technique was implemented by constructing pseudo-CT images for 10 other prostate cancer patients. The feasibility of these images for RTP was evaluated by comparing HUs in the generated pseudo-CT images with those in standard CT images, and by determining deviations in MRI-based dose distributions compared to those in CT images with 7-field intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) with the anisotropic analytical algorithm and 360° volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT) with the Voxel Monte Carlo algorithm.  Results:   The average HU differences between the constructed pseudo-CT images and standard CT images of each test patient ranged from -2 to 5 HUs and from 22 to 78 HUs in soft and bony tissues, respectively. The average local absolute value differences were 11 HUs in soft tissues and 99 HUs in bones. The planning target volume doses (volumes 95%, 50%, 5%) in the pseudo-CT images were within 0.8% compared to those in CT images in all of the 20 treatment plans. The average deviation was 0.3%. With all the test patients over 94% (IMRT) and 92% (VMAT) of dose points within body (lower than 10% of maximum dose suppressed) passed the 1 mm and 1% 2D gamma index criterion. The statistical tests (t- and F-tests) showed significantly improved (p ≤ 0.05) HU and dose calculation accuracies with the soft tissue conversion method instead of homogeneous representation of these tissues in MRI-based RTP images.  Conclusions:   This study indicates that it is possible to construct high quality pseudo-CT images by converting the intensity values of a single MRI series into HUs in the male pelvis, and to use these images for accurate MRI-based prostate RTP dose calculations.""","""['Juha Korhonen', 'Mika Kapanen', 'Jani Keyriläinen', 'Tiina Seppälä', 'Mikko Tenhunen']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Feasibility of MRI-only treatment planning for proton therapy in brain and prostate cancers: Dose calculation accuracy in substitute CT images.', 'T1/T2*-weighted MRI provides clinically relevant pseudo-CT density data for the pelvic bones in MRI-only based radiotherapy treatment planning.', 'Absorbed doses behind bones with MR image-based dose calculations for radiotherapy treatment planning.', 'Systematic Review of Synthetic Computed Tomography Generation Methodologies for Use in Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Only Radiation Therapy.', 'A review of substitute CT generation for MRI-only radiation therapy.', 'Synthetic computed tomography based dose calculation in prostate cancer patients with hip prostheses for magnetic resonance imaging-only radiotherapy.', 'Dose accumulation for MR-guided adaptive radiotherapy: From practical considerations to state-of-the-art clinical implementation.', 'Feasibility of artificial-intelligence-based synthetic computed tomography in a magnetic resonance-only radiotherapy workflow for brain radiotherapy: Two-way dose validation and 2D/2D kV-image-based positioning.', 'Emergence of MR-Linac in Radiation Oncology: Successes and Challenges of Riding on the MRgRT Bandwagon.', 'The Promise of Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Radiation Oncology Practice in the Management of Brain, Prostate, and GI Malignancies.']"""

Therapies with androgen receptor (AR) antagonists and androgen withdrawal initially regress tumors but development of compensatory mechanisms including AR bypass signaling leads to re-growth of tumors. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small regulatory RNAs that are involved in maintenance of cell homeostasis but are often altered in tumor cells.  Results:   In this study, we determined the association of genome wide miRNA expression (1113 unique miRNAs) with development of resistance to ADT. We used androgen sensitive prostate cancer cells that progressed to ADT and AR antagonist Casodex (CDX) resistance upon androgen withdrawal and treatment with CDX. Validation of expression of a subset of 100 miRNAs led to identification of 43 miRNAs that are significantly altered during progression of cells to treatment resistance. We also show a correlation of altered expression of 10 proteins targeted by some of these miRNAs in these cells.  Conclusions:   We conclude that dynamic alterations in miRNA expression occur early on during androgen deprivation therapy, and androgen receptor blockade. The cumulative effect of these altered miRNA expression profiles is the temporal modulation of multiple signaling pathways promoting survival and acquisition of resistance. These early events are driving the transition to castration resistance and cannot be studied in already developed CRPC cell lines or tissues.

Castration-recurrent (CR)-CaP is likely driven by the activation of androgen receptor (AR) through multiple mechanisms including induction of AR coregulators, AR mutants or splice variants, and AR posttranslational modification such as phosphorylation by Src-family and Ack1 tyrosine kinases. Here, we address whether Src is required for the CR growth of human CWR22 CaP xenografts. The shRNA-mediated Src knockdown or treatment with the Src inhibitors, dasatinib or KXO1, reduced CaP recurrence over controls and increased time-to-recurrence following castration. Moreover, CR-CaP [Src-shRNA] tumors that recurred had similar Src protein and activation levels as those of parental cells, strengthening the notion that Src activity is required for progression to CR-CaP. In contrast, the ability of dasatinib or KXO1 to inhibit Src kinase activity in vitro did not correlate with their ability to inhibit serum-driven in vitro proliferation of CR and androgen-dependent stable cell lines derived from CWR22 tumors (CWR22Rv1 and CWR22PC, respectively), suggesting that the in vitro proliferation of these CaP lines is Src independent. Taken together, these findings strongly suggest that Src is a potent and specific therapeutic target for CR-CaP progression.""","""['Bing Su', 'Bryan Gillard', 'Lingqiu Gao', 'Kevin H Eng', 'Irwin H Gelman']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Cancer Med""","""['Dasatinib inhibits site-specific tyrosine phosphorylation of androgen receptor by Ack1 and Src kinases.', 'Identification and validation of phospho-SRC, a novel and potential pharmacodynamic biomarker for dasatinib (SPRYCEL), a multi-targeted kinase inhibitor.', 'Targeting Src-mediated Tyr216 phosphorylation and activation of GSK-3 in prostate cancer cells inhibit prostate cancer progression in vitro and in vivo.', 'Androgen receptor activation in castration-recurrent prostate cancer: the role of Src-family and Ack1 tyrosine kinases.', 'Dasatinib: a potent SRC inhibitor in clinical development for the treatment of solid tumors.', 'PTEN regulated PI3K-p110 and AKT isoform plasticity controls metastatic prostate cancer progression.', 'Reduced NCOR2 expression accelerates androgen deprivation therapy failure in prostate cancer.', 'Constitutive Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor Signaling in Prostate Cancer Progression.', 'Randomized Phase II Trial of Abiraterone Alone or With Dasatinib in Men With Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC).', 'Simultaneous inhibition of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and Src abolishes androgen receptor signaling.']"""

This study is devoted to compare the occurrences and rank correlations of SPCs between Germany and Sweden. Patients diagnosed with 10 common first primaries between 1997 and 2006 from the Swedish Family-Cancer Database and 10 German cancer registries were included in this population-based study. Spearman's rank correlation coefficients were used to evaluate the strength of the relationship of SPCs between the German and Swedish datasets. Spearman's rank correlation coefficients suggested a strong positive correlation between the German and Swedish datasets based on the ranks of thirty possible SPCs after all selected first cancers. This was also true when we compared the rankings and proportions of the five most common SPCs after site-specific first primaries between the two populations. For kidney cancer, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and leukemia the components of the five most common SPCs was exactly the same. Also, the ranking and the proportions for the three most common SPCs (i.e., colorectal, bladder, and lung cancers) after prostate cancer were identical in the two populations, as were those after most other primary cancers. The strikingly consistent patterns of SPCs in the two populations provide excellent opportunities for joint studies and they also suggest that many underlying reasons for SPC may have universal and tangible causes that await mechanistic dissection.""","""['Hao Liu', 'Kari Hemminki', 'Jan Sundquist', 'Bernd Holleczek', 'Alexander Katalinic', 'Katharina Emrich', 'Lina Jansen', 'Hermann Brenner;GEKID Cancer Survival Working Group']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Cancer Med""","""['Impact of family history of cancer on risk and mortality of second cancers in patients with prostate cancer.', 'Second primary cancers after cancer of unknown primary in Sweden and Germany: efficacy of the modern work-up.', 'Risk of second primary cancers in women diagnosed with endometrial cancer in German and Swedish cancer registries.', 'Risk of extracolonic second primary cancers following a primary colorectal cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Is there a role for IGF-1 in the development of second primary cancers?', 'Clinical characteristics and survival of second primary breast carcinoma with extramammary malignancies.', 'A comprehensive analysis of renal cell carcinoma as first and second primary cancers.', 'Second Primary Renal Cell Carcinoma With Nonrenal Malignancies: An Analysis of 118 Cases and a Review of Literature.', 'Second Primary Cancers After Gastric Cancer, and Gastric Cancer as Second Primary Cancer.']"""

A tumor suppressor function has been demonstrated for GLCE in breast and lung carcinogenesis; however, no data are available as to the expression and regulation of the gene in prostate cancer. In this study, decreased GLCE expression was observed in 10% of benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) tissues and 53% of prostate tumors, and increased GLCE mRNA levels were detected in 49% of BPH tissues and 21% of tumors. Statistical analysis showed a positive correlation between increased GLCE expression and Gleason score, TNM staging, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level in the prostate tumors (Pearson correlation coefficients GLCE/Gleason = 0.56, P < 0.05; GLCE/TNM = 0.62, P < 0.05; and GLCE/PSA = 0.88, P < 0.01), suggesting GLCE as a candidate molecular marker for advanced prostate cancer. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed an intratumoral heterogeneity of GLCE protein levels both in BPH and prostate cancer cells, resulting in a mixed population of GLCE-expressing and nonexpressing epithelial cells in vivo. A model experiment on normal (PNT2) and prostate cancer (LNCaP, PC3, DU145) cell lines in vitro showed a 1.5- to 2.5-fold difference in GLCE expression levels between the cancer cell lines and an overall decrease in GLCE expression in cancer cells. Methyl-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR), bisulfite sequencing, and deoxy-azacytidin (aza-dC) treatment identified differential GLCE promoter methylation (LNCaP 70-72%, PC3 32-35%, DU145, and PNT2 no methylation), which seems to contribute to heterogeneous GLCE expression in prostate tumors.

This is due to the increased expression of a number of growth factors, cytokines, and proteases which collectively drive the metastatic cascade in general and increased propensity to develop skeletal metastasis in particular. While a number of signaling pathways have been implicated in PCa progression, the highly complex wnt/β-catenin pathway is unique due to its ability to regulate gene expression, cell invasion, migration, survival, proliferation, and differentiation to contribute in the initiation and progression of PCa. Members of the wnt family bind to the Frizzle proteins or lipoprotein-related receptor proteins 5, 6 (LRP5, -6) to activate this key pathway. In the current study, we have investigated the role of wnt/β-catenin pathway in PCa progression, skeletal metastasis, and gene expression using the dominant negative plasmid of LRP5 (DN-LRP5) and human PCa cells PC-3. Inactivation of LRP5 resulted in mesenchymal to epithelial shift, lack of translocation of β-catenin to cell surface, increased tumor cell proliferation, decreased colony formation, migration and invasion in vitro. These effects were attributed to decreased expression of pro-invasive and pro-metastatic genes. In in vivo studies, PC-3-DN-LRP5 cells developed significantly smaller tumors and a marked decrease in skeletal lesion area and number as determined by X-ray, micro (μ) CT and histological analysis.

The role of Dyn2 in cell invasiveness was assessed by in vitro and in vivo experiments using androgen-responsive and refractory PCA preclinical models. Dyn2 expression was significantly increased across advanced stages of PCA compared to benign prostate tissue (P < 0.0001). In the CRPC cohort, high Dyn2 was associated with higher Gleason score (P = 0.004) and marginally with cancer-specific mortality (P = 0.052). In preclinical models, Dyn2 gene silencing significantly reduced cell migration and invasion in vitro, as well as tumor size and lymph node metastases in vivo. In isolated PCA cells, Dyn2 was found to regulate focal adhesion turnover, which is critical for cell migration; this mechanism requires full Dyn2 compared to mutants deficient in GTPase activity.

Combination therapy is a new approach in the treatment of cancers that do not respond to current therapies. These therapies have many advantages over conventional therapies, such as fewer side-effects and greater efficiency. Research efforts using natural compounds for the elimination or growth suppression of the cancer arise from studies on methylsulfonylmethane (MSM). MSM is a natural sulfur compound with no side-effects. AG490 is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that has been extensively used for inhibiting Jak2 in vitro and in vivo. In our study, the combinatorial effect of these two agents on human bladder cancer cell lines and xenografts was analyzed. We observed that the combination of AG490 and MSM inhibited cancer cell viability and cell migration in vitro. This combination inhibited VEGF mRNA expression in bladder cancer cell lines. In vivo experiments showed that oral administration of AG490 and MSM combination significantly inhibited the growth of tumor xenografts in mice. Our study clearly demonstrates that the predominant effect of this combination is the reduction of signaling molecules including STAT3, STAT5b, IGF-1R, VEGF and VEGF-R2 which are involved in the growth, progression and metastasis of human bladder cancer.

Materials and methods:   Nineteen consecutive patients with IBD (14 with ulcerative colitis, 5 with Crohn disease) who were treated with abdominal or pelvic external beam radiation therapy at Stanford University from 1997 to 2011 were identified. Fourteen patients were treated with IMRT and 5 were treated with 3D-CRT. Treated sites included prostate (n=8), gastric/esophageal (n=5), rectal/anal (n=3), and liver (n=3) tumors. Charts were reviewed and toxicity was graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Acute Events version 4.0. Median follow-up was 32.5 months. Fisher exact test was used to determine if any clinical and/or treatment factors were associated with toxicity outcomes.  Results:   Acute grade ≥3 toxicity occurred in 2 patients (11%). Late grade ≥3 toxicity occurred in 1 patient (6%). Acute grade ≥2 toxicity occurred in 28% of patients treated with IMRT versus 100% of patients treated with 3D-CRT (P=0.01). Acute grade ≥2 gastrointestinal toxicity was lower in patients treated with IMRT versus 3D-CRT (14% vs. 100%, respectively, P=0.002). Late grade ≥2 toxicity occurred in 21% of patients.

We sought to examine these parameters in a contemporary cohort.  Patients and methods:   From 2011 to 2013, patients undergoing RARP were prospectively enrolled in a study to examine various pain parameters and carefully monitor opiate and other analgesic medication use while the patient recovered in the hospital. After discharge, the patients were asked to fill out a daily questionnaire regarding their pain parameters and self-report opiate usage. All questionnaires were based on the Wong-Baker FACES pain rating scale (0-10). Opiate dosages were converted to the approximate oral morphine sulfate equivalent dose (MSE).  Results:   A total of 60 patients, mean age 61 years, were enrolled in the study, underwent RARP, and completed follow-up questionnaires. None had a history of chronic narcotic use. Intraoperative opiate use was 94.1 mg MSE. There were 73.3% who received immediate postoperative ketorolac. After RARP, the main source of pain/discomfort was abdominal/incisional, followed by urethral catheter-related, penile, and bladder spasm-related discomfort. Abdominal pain was generally moderate for most patients and decreased significantly after about 4 days. Penile and urethral catheter-related discomfort was mild throughout the study period. Opiate analgesic medication use quickly decreased as the subjective pain scores improved.  Conclusions:   After RARP, most patients experience mild/moderate abdominal discomfort, which improves steadily over several days. There is also a quick decline in the average opiate pain medication use that corresponds to the subjective improvement in pain symptoms. This information is useful for clinicians counseling patients on the pain associated with RARP and can serve as a reference to compare the convalescence associated with the other options for treatment of patients with localized prostate cancer.""","""['Solomon L Woldu', 'Aaron C Weinberg', 'Ari Bergman', 'Edan Y Shapiro', 'Ruslan Korets', 'Piruz Motamedinia', 'Ketan K Badani']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Endourol""","""['Early Catheter Removal after Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy: Surgical Technique and Outcomes for the Aalst Technique (ECaRemA Study).', 'Dorsal penile nerve block for robot-assisted radical prostatectomy catheter related pain: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.', 'Long-term follow-up of patients undergoing percutaneous suprapubic tube drainage after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP).', 'Suprapubic Versus Urethral Catheter for Urinary Drainage After Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Outcomes of robotic assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Comparison of a Non-Opioid Multimodal Analgesia Protocol with Opioid-Based Patient-Controlled Analgesia for Pain Control Following Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy: A Randomized, Non-Inferiority Trial.', 'Ultrasound-guided posterior quadratus lumborum block for postoperative pain control after minimally invasive radical prostatectomy: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.', 'Opioid use after uro-oncologic surgeries in time of opioid crisis.', 'Minimizing opioid consumption following robotic surgery.', 'Comparative effectiveness of robotic and open radical prostatectomy.']"""

Methods:   This retrospective study examined prospectively collected data on 219 robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomies performed from May 2011 to February 2013. Patients were divided into four groups based on pathologic prostate weight: <30 g, 30-49 g, 50-79 g, and ≥80 g. Continence and sexual function were assessed using validated questionnaires.  Results:   Of the 219 patients, 19, 143, 51, and 6 had prostates weighing <30 g, 30-49 g, 50-79 g, and ≥80 g, respectively. Significant differences were found between the preoperative Gleason scores, total operative times, and robotic times of the groups. Both estimated blood loss and anastomosis time tended to be greater in the higher prostate weight groups, but the differences were not significant. No significant differences were observed in transfusion rate, length of catheterization, complication incidence, or positive surgical margins. The return of urinary function, as determined by questionnaire scores, was not affected by prostate weight.  Conclusions:   Robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy can be performed safely and with similar perioperative outcomes, regardless of prostate weight.

Consequently, rates of active surveillance, the preferred management modality per the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) for patients with low- and very low-risk disease and a life expectancy of less than 10 and less than 20 years, respectively, are low. We sought to determine whether consultation with a medical oncologist is associated with increased rates of active surveillance in men with low-risk prostate cancer.  Methods:   We identified 188 patients with low-risk prostate cancer undergoing active surveillance at one of three referral centers in Boston, MA in 2009. Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine whether consultation with a medical oncologist was associated with selection of active surveillance. The data were reanalyzed for patients with low- and very low-risk disease and a life expectancy of less than 10 and less than 20 years, respectively.  Results:   Consultation with a medical oncologist was associated with increased rates of active surveillance (37% v 21%, P = .01), an association that remained significant on multivariable logistic regression (odds ratio [OR] = 2.70; 95% CI, 1.27 to 5.75; P = .01).

The purpose of this study is to use age, Gleason score, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level to help inform patients with screen-detected prostate cancers about the chances their cancers were overdiagnosed.  Methods:   A computer microsimulation model of prostate cancer natural history was used to generate virtual life histories in the presence and absence of PSA screening, including an indicator of whether screen-detected cancers are overdiagnosed. A logistic regression model was fit to nonmetastatic patients diagnosed by screening with PSA less than 10 ng/mL, and a nomogram was created to predict the individualized risk of overdiagnosis given age, Gleason score, and PSA at diagnosis.  Results:   The calibrated microsimulation model closely reproduces observed incidence trends in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registries by age, stage, and Gleason score. The fitted logistic regression predicts risks of overdiagnosis among PSA-detected patients with an area under the curve of 0.75. Chances of overdiagnosis range from 2.9% to 88.1%.

Nonetheless, the underlying mechanism of ursolic acid in prostate cancer cells still remains unclear. To investigate the antitumor mechanism, the apoptotic mechanism of ursolic acid via Wnt/β-catenin signaling was examined in PC-3 prostate cancer cells.  Methods:   Cytotoxicity assay, flow cytometry, immunofluorescence assay and western blotting were performed.  Results:   Ursolic acid showed cytotoxicity against PC-3, LNCaP and DU145 prostate cancer cells with IC50 of 35 μM, 47 μM and 80 μM, respectively. Also, ursolic acid significantly increased the number of ethidium homodimer stained cells and apoptotic bodies, and dose-dependently enhanced the sub-G1 apoptotic accumulation in PC-3 cells. Consistently, western blotting revealed that ursolic acid effectively cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), activated caspase-9 and -3, suppressed the expression of survival proteins such as Bcl-XL, Bcl-2 and Mcl-1, and upregulated the expression of Bax in PC-3 cells. Interestingly, ursolic acid suppressed the expression of Wnt5α/β and β-catenin, and enhanced the phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase 3 β (GSK3β). Furthermore, the GSK3β inhibitor SB216763 or Wnt3a-conditioned medium (Wnt3a-CM) reversed the cleavages of caspase-3 and PARP induced by ursolic acid in PC-3 cells.  Conclusions:   Our findings suggest that ursolic acid induces apoptosis via inhibition of the Wnt5/β-catenin pathway and activation of caspase in PC-3 prostate cancer cells.

Four percent of centenarians die from cancer. It is therefore important to understand which cancers affect them in order to devise better methods to prevent and treat them. The aim of this study was to investigate the top cancers that affect centenarians.  Material and methods:   We identified 1385 cases with the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Result (SEER) database. Our study included centenarians age 100-115 years diagnosed with the 5 most common cancers between 1973 and 2007 in the United States. Observed survival (OS) was calculated for each cancer type. The Kaplan-Meier (KM) method was used to calculate OS at 1-month intervals for the first 40 months after diagnosis using SEER*Stat version 7.04. A log rank test was performed on KM survival output and a Cox proportional hazard model was used to calculate hazard ratios. All statistical analyses were performed with 95% confidence intervals with significance determined at P<0.05. Cox proportional hazard analysis was done using GraphPad Prism version 5.04.  Results:   There were 879 (63.47%) females and 506 (36.53%) males. There were 1118 (80.72%) whites, 159 (11.48%) blacks, and 108 (7.80%) other. The top cancers were 405 (29.24%) breast, 267 (19.28%) colorectal, 254 (18.34%) prostate, 247 (17.83%) lung and bronchus, and 212 (15.31%) urinary and kidney cancer cases.

The TGFβ type I receptor (TβRI) is proteolytically cleaved in the ectodomain region. Cleavage requires the combined activities of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) and TNF-α-converting enzyme (TACE). The cleavage event occurs selectively in cancer cells and generates an intracellular domain (ICD) of TβRI, which enters the nucleus to mediate gene transcription. Presenilin 1 (PS1), a γ-secretase catalytic core component, mediates intramembrane proteolysis of transmembrane receptors, such as Notch. We showed that TGFβ increased both the abundance and activity of PS1. TRAF6 recruited PS1 to the TβRI complex and promoted lysine-63-linked polyubiquitination of PS1, which activated PS1. Furthermore, PS1 cleaved TβRI in the transmembrane domain between valine-129 and isoleucine-130, and ICD generation was inhibited when these residues were mutated to alanine. We also showed that, after entering the nucleus, TβRI-ICD bound to the promoter and increased the transcription of the gene encoding TβRI. The TRAF6- and PS1-induced intramembrane proteolysis of TβRI promoted TGFβ-induced invasion of various cancer cells in vitro. Furthermore, when a mouse xenograft model of prostate cancer was treated with the γ-secretase inhibitor DBZ {(2S)-2-[2-(3,5-difluorophenyl)-acetylamino]-N-(5-methyl-6-oxo-6,7-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[b,d]azepin-7-yl)-propionamide}, generation of TβRI-ICD was prevented, transcription of the gene encoding the proinvasive transcription factor Snail1 was reduced, and tumor growth was inhibited.

The Prostate Cancer in a Black Population (PCBP) Study, a large case-control investigation including 1,007 incident PC cases and 1,005 controls, performed DARC testing on a subset of 1,295 participants (641 cases, 654 controls). The relationship between DARC expressivity and PC risk was evaluated using logistic regression models and findings are presented as odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals. More than three-quarters (76.5%) of African-Barbadian men lacked DARC expression, whereas almost three-fifths (59.3%) of White participants tested positive for the Duffy a and b alleles.

It was recently discovered that the Kank1 gene is a new cancer suppressor, and its expression is significantly downregulated or it is not expressed in kidney cancer, bladder cancer, prostate cancer, lung cancer and breast cancer. However, no report on the role of Kank1 in the genesis of brain glioma is available to date. In this study, we found significantly lower expression of the Kank1 gene in human brain glioma cells compared to the other cells evaluated. We used RNA interference techniques to silence Kank1 gene expression and found acceleration of tumor cell proliferation. However, when the Kank1 gene was upregulated, cell apoptosis occurred and the cell cycle was blocked in the G0/G1 phase. Also, we found that upregulating the Kank1 gene may result in the change of mitochondrial membrane potential, and the regulation of Bax and Bcl-2 may promote the mitochondria to release cytochrome C so as to activate Caspase-9 and -3.

The budget impact analysis of dutasteride vs finasteride in BPH-treated patient was performed.  Results:   From an initial cohort of about 1.5 million of Italian men, 19620 were selected. The overall hospitalization for BPH-non surgical reasons, for BPH-related surgery and for new detection of PCa incidence rates (IRs) were 8.20 (95% CI, 7.62-8.23), 18.0 (95% CI, 17.12-18.93) and 8.62 (95% CI, 8.03-9.26) per 1000 person-years, respectively. The multivariate analysis after the propensity score-matching showed that dutasteride was associated with an independent reduced likelihood of hospitalization for BPH-related surgery (HR 0.82; 95% CI 0.73-0.93; p = 0.0025) and of newly detected PCa (HR: 0.76,95% CI, 0.65-0.85; p = 0.0116). The IR for BPH-non surgical reasons was 8.07 (95% CI, 7.10-9.17) and 9.25 (95% CI, 8.19-10.44) per 1000 person-years, respectively. The IR for BPH-related surgery was 18.28 (95% CI, 17.17-20.32) and 21.28 (95% CI, 19.24-23.06) per 1000 person-years among patients under dutasteride compared with those under finasteride, respectively. For new-onset PCa, the IR was 8.01 (95% CI, 7.07-9.08) and 9.38 (95% CI, 8.32-10.58) per 1000 person-years The pharmacoeconomical evaluation showed that the net budget impact of the use of dutasteride vs. finasteride in 1000 BPH-treated patient for 1 year induces a saving of 3933 €.  Conclusions:   The clinical effects of dutasteride and finasteride are slightly different. The likelihood of hospitalization for BPH-related surgery and of newly detected PCa seems to be in favor of dutasteride. The budget impact analyses showed a slightly benefit for dutasteride. Comparative prospective studies are necessary to confirm these results.""","""['Luca Cindolo', 'Francesco Berardinelli', 'Caterina Fanizza', 'Marilena Romero', 'Luisella Pirozzi', 'Fabiola Raffaella Tamburro', 'Fabrizio Pellegrini', 'Fabio Neri', 'Andrea Pitrelli', 'Luigi Schips']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Arch Ital Urol Androl""","""['The effects of dutasteride and finasteride on BPH-related hospitalization, surgery and prostate cancer diagnosis: a record-linkage analysis.', 'A 5-year retrospective analysis of 5α-reductase inhibitors in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia: finasteride has comparable urinary symptom efficacy and prostate volume reduction, but less sexual side effects and breast complications than dutasteride.', 'Rates of prostate surgery and acute urinary retention for benign prostatic hyperplasia in men treated with dutasteride or finasteride.', 'Current Pharmacological Treatment for Male LUTS due to BPH: Dutasteride or Finasteride?', 'A systematic review of the effects and mechanisms of preoperative 5α-reductase inhibitors on intraoperative haemorrhage during surgery for benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'BPH: Why Do Patients Fail Medical Therapy?', 'Comparing Clinical and Economic Outcomes Associated with Early Initiation of Combination Therapy of an Alpha Blocker and Dutasteride or Finasteride in Men with Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia in the United States.', 'Efficacy and safety of dutasteride for the treatment of symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH): a systematic review and meta-analysis.']"""

A preliminary report obtained by using Adnagene platform""","""Objective:   Prostate cancer (PCa) represents one of the most important medical problems for males, being the second major cause of cancer death. Routinely, PCa patients are followed up with both periodic evaluation of serum PSA levels and imaging. Recently, alternative laboratory methods were proposed for PCa patients' monitoring, with contrasting results. Aim of the present study was to evaluate the usefulness of a new commercially CE-IVD kit for detection of prostate circulating tumour cells. Our intention was to verify the Adnagene platform usefulness to identify patients with disease progression, whatever treatment ongoing, in order to modify the therapeutic process even before treatment failure is evident with imaging methods.  Materials and methods:   Twenty-one patients were enrolled and subdivided into three groups: n = 10 high risk tumor PCa patients; n = 6 low risk PCa patients; n = 5 sbjects without any signs of PCa. AdnaTest Prostate Cancer kit was used for enrichment and molecular characterization of prostate circulating tumour cells.  Results:   Healthy subjects (with BPH) and patients without metastases resulted as negative, while 3 out of 10 high risk PCa patients were positive at least for one molecular marker like PSA, while only two showed positivity for PSMA mRNA. Our results indicate that the test specificity is 100% and the sensitivity is 100%; of course the sample is too small to give it statistical validity. In detail we verified that only the ""not responder"" patients resulted positive for AdnaTest.  Conclusions:   The present preliminary report provides evidence that isolation and detection of circulating tumour cells (CTCs) is feasible and it may be useful in the follow-up of patients with advanced prostate cancer. If the results of this preliminary study would be confirmed by a large prospective cohort study, it could be demonstrated that this test is a rapid diagnostic method, based on the analysis of a blood sample and useful to the clinician to decide when to change therapy for patients resistant to castration or able to confirm that, at that time, the therapy is effective.""","""['Giuseppe Albino', 'Francesca Vendittelli', 'Carmela Paolillo', 'Cecilia Zuppi', 'Ettore Capoluongo']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Arch Ital Urol Androl""","""['Expression of tumour progression-associated genes in circulating tumour cells of patients at different stages of prostate cancer.', 'Circulating tumor cells as a predictive biomarker in patients with hormone-sensitive prostate cancer.', 'Detection of Circulating Tumor Cells in Locally Advanced High-risk Prostate Cancer During Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy and Radical Prostatectomy.', 'The current role of circulating tumor cells in the diagnosis and management of bone metastases in advanced prostate cancer.', 'Contemporary role of prostate cancer antigen 3 in the management of prostate cancer.', 'Liquid Biopsy Potential Biomarkers in Prostate Cancer.', 'When Prostate Cancer Circulates in the Bloodstream.']"""

Their involvement in crucial DNA associated-processes, such as replication, transcription and repair, mark them as a target of chemotherapeutic drugs such as camptothecins (CPTs). Therefore, finding other agents that may alter their activity is of great importance. Previous data showed that certain tyrosine kinase antagonists, tyrphostins, inhibit the catalytic activity of the cellular topoisomerase I (topo I). We examined the effect of clinically used tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), erlotinib and gefitinib, on topo I in breast and prostate cancer cells. While erlotinib and gefitinib inhibit cellular topo I in treated cells without affecting the levels of the enzyme protein, in vitro assays show that erlotinib, but not gefitinib, inhibits the DNA relaxation activity of purified topo I. Erlotinib was found to reduce the DNA-binding ability of topo I, however, the reduction in topo I activity in gefitinib-treated cells is probably due to post-translational modifications of the enzyme protein. A combined treatment of either erlotinib or gefitinib with CPT increased the effect of CPT on the activity of cellular topo I, which supports the increased anticancer effect observed in MCF7 cells. These results suggest that topo I is a novel target of erlotinib and a combination of TKIs with topo I inhibitors may be an effective treatment for breast cancer.""","""['Refael Peleg', 'Dmitri Bobilev', 'Esther Priel']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Int J Oncol""","""['Modification of topoisomerases in mammospheres derived from breast cancer cell line: clinical implications for combined treatments with tyrosine kinase inhibitors.', 'DNA topoisomerase I as one of the cellular targets of certain tyrphostin derivatives.', 'TCH-1030 targeting on topoisomerase I induces S-phase arrest, DNA fragmentation, and cell death of breast cancer cells.', '3-Arylisoquinolines as novel topoisomerase I inhibitors.', 'Strategies Targeting DNA Topoisomerase I in Cancer Chemotherapy: Camptothecins, Nanocarriers for Camptothecins, Organic Non-Camptothecin Compounds and Metal Complexes.', 'CIB1 depletion with docetaxel or TRAIL enhances triple-negative breast cancer cell death.', 'Modification of topoisomerases in mammospheres derived from breast cancer cell line: clinical implications for combined treatments with tyrosine kinase inhibitors.', 'Afatinib circumvents multidrug resistance via dually inhibiting ATP binding cassette subfamily G member 2 in vitro and in vivo.', 'Polyphenols as key players for the antileukaemic effects of propolis.']"""

Methods:   From October 2007 to March 2012, 52 patients underwent PDR during eLRP for HRPCa. Fifty-four patients who underwent eLRP for HRPCa with no PDR were considered as historical controls. Mean operative time (MOT), mean catheterization time (MCT), % continence and quality of life (QoL) at a scheduled follow-up, % anastomotic leakage, % adjuvant therapy were compared between the groups. Percentage of continence and QoL were prospectively assessed by self-administered validated questionnaires (ICI-Q-SF; SF-36) at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months.  Results:   PDR was associated wither higher continence rates at 1 and 3 mo (P = .028, P = .006), a lower incidence of cystographic leakage (P = .002), and an increased adjuvant radiotherapy rate (P = .008).

Conclusions:   PDR is associated with a lower degree of anastomotic leakage, and it significantly enhances urinary continence at 1 and 3 mo.

Folic acid was conjugated to poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) polymer to facilitate active targeting to cancer cells. Two different methods for the conjugation of PLGA to folic acid were employed utilizing polyethylene glycol (PEG) as a spacer. Characterization of the conjugates was performed using FTIR and (1)H NMR studies. The PEG and folic acid content was independent of the conjugation methodology employed. PEGylation has shown to reduce the size of the nanocapsule; moreover, zeta-potential was shown to be polymer-type dependent. Comparative studies on the cytotoxicity and cellular uptake of the different formulations by HeLa cells, in the presence and absence of excess folic acid, were carried out using MTT assay and Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy, respectively.

Patients and methods:   A total of 95 consecutive patients underwent laparoscopic RP for clinically localized prostate cancer (PC) by an experienced single surgeon from October 2009 to December 2012. Baseline characteristics, perioperative and pathologic variables, and continence data at 3 months after surgery were retrospectively reviewed from a prospectively maintained database. Categoric and continuous variables were compared using chi-square, Student t, and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests, as appropriate.  Results:   A total of 29 patients underwent laparoscopic RP using a 3D display system and 66 patients underwent laparoscopic RP using a 2D display system. The two groups were comparable for all clinical and pathologic variables. Mean total operative time for the 3D group was 131 minutes (standard deviation [SD]±18) compared with 190 (SD±31) for the 2D group (P<0.001). Mean time to perform the urethrovesical anastomosis was 28 minutes (SD±6) for the 3D group compared with 87 minutes (SD±17) for the 2D group (P<0.001). Blood loss was lower in the 3D group, and the difference was statistically significant (P<0.001). A statistically significant higher number of patients in the 3D group had early recovery of continence compared with patients in the 2D group (14/28 (50%) patients in the 3D group vs 16/64 (25%) patients in the 2D group, P=0.02).  Conclusions:   Laparoscopic RP aided by a new-generation 3D display system is associated with shorter operative times, reduced blood loss, and higher early continence rates in comparison with that aided by a 2D display system.

Materials and methods:   Using a novel flood source construct, we performed a direct comparison of genome-wide gene expression regulations resulting from exposure of primary human prostate fibroblast cultures to acute (10 cGy and 200 cGy) and longer-term chronic (1.0-2.45 cGy cumulative over 24 h) exposures.  Results:   Expression profiling showed significant differential regulation of 396 genes with no measureable changes in the acute 10 cGy dose. However, there were 106 genes in common between samples given an acute 200 cGy dose compared to those given chronic doses, most of which were decreased and related to cell cycle or chromosomal movement in M-phase. Biological pathway analysis showed decreases in cell cycle, chromosomal movement, cell survival and DNA replication, recombination and repair as well as a predicted activation of transcriptional regulators TP53, RB1 and CDKN2A. In agreement with these results, prostate epithelial cells given 200 cGy or chronic doses displayed functional decreases in proliferation and mitotic cells.  Conclusions:   In summary, we showed a contrast to the common observation of constant or reduced effect per unit dose as the dose (acute) was diminished, that even very low total doses delivered chronically could rival the perturbing effect of acute doses 100 times as intense. Underscored is the importance of the means of dose delivery, shown to be as important as dose size when considering biologic effect.""","""['J Tyson McDonald', 'Christine Briggs', 'Heather Szelag', 'Michael Peluso', 'Douglas Schneider', 'Aleksandr Perepletchikov', 'Giannoula Lakka Klement', 'Ingolf Tuerk', 'Lynn Hlatky']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Biol""","""['Cell cycle arrest and aberration yield in normal human fibroblasts.

Methods:   Retrospective analysis of all patients with a history of negative prebiopsies, who underwent 3 Tesla multiparametric MRI from October 2011 to April 2013 (n = 143): PI-RADS scores for each single modality were defined. To generate the overall PI-RADS score, an algorithm based approach summing up each single-modality score to a sum-score was compared to a more subjective approach, weighting the single modalities dependent on the radiologist's impression. Because of ongoing cancer suspicion 73 patients underwent targeted mpMRI-ultrasound image fusion rebiopsy. For this group thresholds for tumor incidences and malignancy were calculated.  Results:   39 (53%) out of 73 targeted rebiopsies were cancer positive. The PI-RADS score correlated well with tumor incidence (AUC of 0.86, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.94) and malignancy (AUC 0.84, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.99). Regarding the sum-score a threshold of ≥ 10 turned out to be reliable for cancer detection (sensitivity 90%, specificity 62%) and for ≥ 13 for indicating higher malignancy (Gleason ≥ 4 + 3) (sensitivity 80%, specificity 86%). To generate the overall PI-RADS score, the use of an algorithm based approach was more reliable than that of the approach based on the radiologist's impression.

Two cancer treatments where labile iron may contribute to their mechanism of action are pharmacological ascorbate and ionizing radiation (IR). Pharmacological ascorbate has been shown to have tumor-specific toxic effects due to the formation of hydrogen peroxide. By catalyzing the oxidation of ascorbate, labile iron can enhance the rate of formation of hydrogen peroxide; labile iron can also react with hydrogen peroxide. Here we have investigated the magnitude of the labile iron pool in tumor and normal tissue. We also examined the ability of pharmacological ascorbate and IR to change the size of the labile iron pool. Although a significant amount of labile iron was seen in tumors (MIA PaCa-2 cells in athymic nude mice), higher levels were seen in murine tissues that were not susceptible to pharmacological ascorbate. Pharmacological ascorbate and irradiation were shown to increase the labile iron in tumor homogenates from this murine model of pancreatic cancer. As both IR and pharmacological ascorbate may rely on labile iron for their effects on tumor tissues, our data suggest that pharmacological ascorbate could be used as a radio-sensitizing agent for some radio-resistant tumors.""","""['Justin C Moser', 'Malvika Rawal', 'Brett A Wagner', 'Juan Du', 'Joseph J Cullen', 'Garry R Buettner']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Redox Biol""","""['Labile iron potentiates ascorbate-dependent reduction and mobilization of ferritin iron.', 'Pharmacological Ascorbate Radiosensitizes Pancreatic Cancer.', 'O2⋅- and H2O2-Mediated Disruption of Fe Metabolism Causes the Differential Susceptibility of NSCLC and GBM Cancer Cells to Pharmacological Ascorbate.', 'Treatment of Pancreatic Cancer with Pharmacological Ascorbate.', 'Ascorbate and ferritin interactions: Consequences for iron release in vitro and in vivo and implications for inflammation.', 'Pyroptosis, ferroptosis, and autophagy cross-talk in glioblastoma opens up new avenues for glioblastoma treatment.', 'Magnetite nanoparticles as a kinetically favorable source of iron to enhance GBM response to chemoradiosensitization with pharmacological ascorbate.', 'Chronic High-Altitude Hypoxia Alters Iron and Nitric Oxide Homeostasis in Fetal and Maternal Sheep Blood and Aorta.', 'Parenteral high‑dose ascorbate - A possible approach for the treatment of glioblastoma (Review).', 'The latency of peroxisomal catalase in terms of effectiveness factor for pancreatic and glioblastoma cancer cell lines in the presence of high concentrations of H2O2: Implications for the use of pharmacological ascorbate in cancer therapy.']"""

We investigated the effects of the latest series of improved, highly potent GHRH antagonists--MIA-602, MIA-606, and MIA-690--on the growth of androgen-dependent as well as castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) cells in vitro and in vivo. GHRH-R and its splice variant, SV1, were present in 22Rv1, LNCaP, and VCaP human prostate cancer cell lines. Androgen-dependent LNCaP and VCaP cells expressed higher levels of GHRH-R protein compared with castration-resistant 22Rv1 cells; however, 22Rv1 expressed higher levels of SV1. In vitro, MIA-602 decreased cell proliferation of 22Rv1, LNCaP, and VCaP prostate cancer cell lines by 70%, 61%, and 20%, respectively (all P < 0.05), indicating direct effects of MIA-602. In vivo, MIA-602 was more effective than MIA-606 and MIA-690 and decreased 22Rv1 xenograft tumor volumes in mice by 63% after 3 wk (P < 0.05). No noticeable untoward effects or changes in body weight occurred. In vitro, the VCaP cell line was minimally inhibited by MIA-602, but in vivo, this line showed a substantial reduction in growth of xenografts in response to MIA-602, indicating both direct and systemic inhibitory effects.

Methods:   To explore the importance of embryonic stem cell (ESC) gene signatures, we identified 641 ESC gene predictors (ESCGPs) using published microarray data sets. ESCGPs were selected in a stepwise manner, and were combined with reported genes. Selected genes were analyzed by multiplex quantitative polymerase chain reaction using prostate fine-needle aspiration samples taken at diagnosis from a Swedish cohort of 189 PCa patients diagnosed between 1986 and 2001. Of these patients, there was overall and PCa-specific survival data available for 97.9%, and 77.9% were primarily treated by hormone therapy only. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard ratios and Kaplan-Meier plots were used for the survival analysis, and a k-nearest neighbor (kNN) algorithm for estimating overall survival.  Results:   An expression signature of VGLL3, IGFBP3 and F3 was shown sufficient to categorize the patients into high-, intermediate- and low-risk subtypes. The median overall survival times of the subtypes were 3.23, 4.00 and 9.85 years, respectively. The difference corresponded to hazard ratios of 5.86 (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.91-11.78, P<0.001) for the high-risk subtype and 3.45 (95% CI: 1.79-6.66, P<0.001) for the intermediate-risk compared with the low-risk subtype. The kNN models that included the gene expression signature outperformed the one designed on clinical parameters alone.  Conclusions:   The expression signature can potentially be used to estimate overall survival time. When validated in future studies, it could be integrated in the routine clinical diagnostic and prognostic procedure of PCa for an optimal treatment decision based on the estimated survival benefit.""","""['Z Peng', 'L Skoog', 'H Hellborg', 'G Jonstam', 'I-L Wingmo', 'M Hjälm-Eriksson', 'U Harmenberg', 'G C Cedermark', 'K Andersson', 'L Ahrlund-Richter', 'S Pramana', 'Y Pawitan', 'M Nistér', 'S Nilsson', 'C Li']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['Improving the Prediction of Prostate Cancer Overall Survival by Supplementing Readily Available Clinical Data with Gene Expression Levels of IGFBP3 and F3 in Formalin-Fixed Paraffin Embedded Core Needle Biopsy Material.', 'Exploration of the Tumor Mutational Burden as a Prognostic Biomarker and Related Hub Gene Identification in Prostate Cancer.', 'A TMEFF2-regulated cell cycle derived gene signature is prognostic of recurrence risk in prostate cancer.', 'Identification of a candidate prognostic gene signature by transcriptome analysis of matched pre- and post-treatment prostatic biopsies from patients with advanced prostate cancer.', 'MicroRNA-21 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells as a novel biomarker in the diagnosis and prognosis of prostate cancer.', 'Prostate cancer resistance leads to a global deregulation of translation factors and unconventional translation.', 'The Prognostic Signature and Therapeutic Value of Phagocytic Regulatory Factors in Prostate Adenocarcinoma (PRAD).', 'A Novel Risk Score (P-score) Based on a Three-Gene Signature, for Estimating the Risk of Prostate Cancer-Specific Mortality.', 'A Review of Prostate Organogenesis and a Role for iPSC-Derived Prostate Organoids to Study Prostate Development and Disease.', 'Comprehensive gene cluster analysis of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma TCGA RNA-seq data defines B cell immunity-related genes as a robust survival predictor.']"""

Objective:   Previously, we have isolated and identified some chemical constituents from this plant. Furthermore, these compounds showed significant inhibition of the proliferation of human pancreatic PANC-1, human lung A549, human gastrointestinal carcinoma SGC 7901, human breast MCF-7, and human prostate PC-3 cancer cells. In the present paper, a major resorcinol derivative called ardisiphenol D was further studied for its antitumor mechanism.  Materials and methods:   MTT assay was used to detect the proliferation of A549 cancer cells. Apoptosis induced by ardisiphenol D was observed by Hoechst 33258 fluorescence staining. Caspase-3 enzyme activity was measured by a commercial caspase-3 enzyme activity detection kit. Protein expression of bax, bcl-2, and caspase-3 was tested by Western blots. In vivo antitumor activity of ardisiphenol D was evaluated by determination of A549 tumor growth in nude mice.  Results:   Ardisiphenol D significantly inhibited the proliferation of A549 cells with an IC50 of 0.997 μM with a 48 h treatment. Hoechst 33258 fluorescence staining results indicated the apoptosis of A549 cells induced by 3.125 μM of ardisiphenol D. About 0.39 and 0.78 μM of ardisiphenol D also potently increased the caspase-3 enzyme activity in 24 h. Furthermore, 0.39-3.125 μM of ardisiphenol D induced the activation of caspase-3 protein and the up-regulation of the ratio of bax/bcl-2 protein expression in A549 cells. After i.p. injection, ardisiphenol D (5 mg/kg) also strongly suppressed the A549 tumor growth in nude mice.  Discussion and conclusion:   Ardisiphenol D induced apoptosis of A549 cells via activation of caspase-3 and up-regulation of the ratio of bax/bcl-2 protein expression. Ardisiphenol D also strongly suppressed the A549 tumor growth in nude mice and exerted antitumor activity in vivo.""","""['Feng Zhao', 'Yuan Hu', 'Chuanke Chong', 'Minghui Lu', 'Liping Chen', 'Weijuan Kan', 'Lei Chen', 'Hongwei Liu']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Pharm Biol""","""['Antitumor effect of resorcinol derivatives from the roots of Ardisia brevicaulis by inducing apoptosis.', 'Paris saponin I induces apoptosis via increasing the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and caspase-3 expression in gefitinib-resistant non-small cell lung cancer in vitro and in vivo.', 'Inhibition effect and its mechanism of nobiletin on proliferation of lung cancer cells.', 'Ocimum sanctum induces apoptosis in A549 lung cancer cells and suppresses the in vivo growth of Lewis lung carcinoma cells.', 'Effect of ZGDHu-1 on proliferation and apoptosis of A549 cells in vitro and antitumor activity in vivo.', 'The complete chloroplast genome of Ardisia brevicaulis Diels 1900, one traditional medicinal plant in southern China.', 'Yiqi Chutan Tang Reduces Gefitinib-Induced Drug Resistance in Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer by Targeting Apoptosis and Autophagy.']"""

Multiple molecules of PSMA-binding small molecule glutamate urea (GLA; targeting agent) and the drug methotrexate (MTX) were conjugated to generation 5 PAMAM dendrimer (G5) through Cu-free ""click"" chemistry. The GLA was conjugated through a stable amide bond, and the MTX was conjugated either through ester (Es)- or amide (Am)-coupling, to generate G5-GLA(m)-(Es)MTX(n) and G5-GLA(m)-(Am)MTX(n), respectively. In serum-containing medium, free MTX was slowly released from ""G5-GLA(m)-(Es)MTX(n)"", with ~8% MTX released from the dendrimer in 72 h, whereas the MTX on G5-GLA(m)-(Am)MTX(n) was completely stable. The G5-GLA(m)-(Am)MTX(n) bound and internalized into PSMA-expressing LNCaP cells, but not into PSMA-negative PC3 cells. The conjugate-inhibited recombinant dihydrofolate reductase and induced potent cytotoxicity in the LNCaP cells, but not in the PC3 cells. Similar to the action of free GLA, stable amide-linked dendrimer-GLA was capable of inhibiting the enzyme N-acetylated α-linked acidic dipeptidase (NAALADase) activity of PSMA.

In prostate cancer, osseous metastasis poses a major clinical challenge. We developed a preclinical orthotopic model of Ewing sarcoma, reflecting the biology of the tumour-bone interactions in human disease and allowing in vivo monitoring of disease progression, and compared this with models of osteosarcoma and prostate carcinoma. Human tumour cell lines were transplanted into non-obese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient (NSG) and Rag2(-/-/)γc(-/-) mice by intrafemoral injection. For Ewing sarcoma, minimal cell numbers (1000-5000) injected in small volumes were able to induce orthotopic tumour growth. Tumour progression was studied using positron emission tomography, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and bioluminescent imaging. Tumours and their interactions with bones were examined by histology. Each tumour induced bone destruction and outgrowth of extramedullary tumour masses, together with characteristic changes in bone that were well visualised by computed tomography, which correlated with post-mortem histology. Ewing sarcoma and, to a lesser extent, osteosarcoma cells induced prominent reactive new bone formation. Osteosarcoma cells produced osteoid and mineralised ""malignant"" bone within the tumour mass itself. Injection of prostate carcinoma cells led to osteoclast-driven osteolytic lesions. Bioluminescent imaging of Ewing sarcoma xenografts allowed easy and rapid monitoring of tumour growth and detection of tumour dissemination to lungs, liver and bone. Magnetic resonance imaging proved useful for monitoring soft tissue tumour growth and volume. Positron emission tomography proved to be of limited use in this model. Overall, we have developed an orthotopic in vivo model for Ewing sarcoma and other primary and secondary human bone malignancies, which resemble the human disease.

However, validation of (11)C-choline PET/CT findings scarcely relied on histologic findings, and prognostic implications of (11)C-choline PET/CT are currently unknown. The aim of this study was to assess whether (11)C-choline PET/CT predicts survival in PCa patients.  Methods:   This retrospective study included 195 PCa patients treated with radical prostatectomy who underwent (11)C-choline PET/CT from December 1, 2004, to July 31, 2007, due to biochemical failure (prostate-specific antigen > 0.2 mg/mL) during androgen-deprivation therapy. PCa-specific survival was computed as the interval from radical prostatectomy to PCa-specific death.  Results:   The median interval after radical prostatectomy was 8.9 y (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.7-18.9 y). The median follow-up after (11)C-choline PET/CT was 4.5 y (95% CI, 0.4-8.5 y). (11)C-choline PET/CT results were positive in 57% of patients. The median PCa-specific survival was 16.4 y (95% CI, 14.0-18.8 y) in patients with negative (11)C-choline PET/CT results and 11.2 y (95% CI, 9.8-12.6 y) in patients with positive (11)C-choline PET/CT results (log-rank: χ(2) = 19.3, P < 0001). At multivariate analysis, statistical significance was obtained for (11)C-choline PET/CT (hazard ratio, 2.53; 95% CI, 1.41-4.53; P = 0.002), prostate-specific antigen (hazard ratio, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.00-1.05; P = 0.037), and Gleason score (>7: hazard ratio, 2.49; 95% CI, 1.25-4.95; P = 0.009). Patients with pathologic (11)C-choline uptake in the prostatic bed or in pelvic or retroperitoneal lymph nodes had longer PCa-specific survival (median, 12.1 y; 95% CI, 10.5-13.7 y) in comparison to patients with pathologic tracer uptake in the skeleton (median, 9.9 y; 95% CI, 6.8-13.1 y) (log-rank: χ(2) = 6.5, P = 0.010). Two internally validated nomograms predicted 10- and 15-y PCa-specific survival probability with an accuracy of 76% and 74%, respectively. In an ancillary analysis, we also showed that (11)C-choline PET/CT predicts PCa-specific survival after PET/CT, with similar statistical power.  Conclusion:   (11)C-choline PET/CT predicts PCa-specific survival in PCa patients treated with radical prostatectomy who develop biochemical failure during androgen-deprivation therapy.

The expression of ZDHHC14, a putative protein palmitoyltransferase with unknown cellular function, was decreased at both RNA and protein levels in testicular germ cell tumours. ZDHHC14 expression was also significantly decreased in a panel of prostate cancer samples and cell lines. In addition to our findings of genetic and protein expression changes in clinical samples, inducible overexpression of ZDHHC14 led to reduced cell viability and increased apoptosis through the classic caspase-dependent apoptotic pathway and heterozygous knockout of ZDHHC14 increased [CORRECTED] cell colony formation ability. Finally, we confirmed our in vitro findings of the tumour suppressor role of ZDHHC14 in a mouse xenograft model, showing that overexpression of ZDHHC14 inhibits tumourigenesis. Thus, we have identified a novel tumour suppressor gene that is commonly down-regulated in testicular germ cell tumours and prostate cancer, as well as given insight into the cellular functional role of ZDHHC14, a potential protein palmitoyltransferase that may play a key protective role in cancer.""","""['Marc Yeste-Velasco', 'Xueying Mao', 'Richard Grose', 'Sakunthala C Kudahetti', 'Dongmei Lin', 'Jacek Marzec', 'Natasa Vasiljević', 'Tracy Chaplin', 'Liyan Xue', 'Maojia Xu', 'Julie M Foster', 'Santi S Karnam', 'Sharon Y James', 'Athina-Myrto Chioni', 'David Gould', 'Attila T Lorincz', 'R Tim D Oliver', 'Claude Chelala', 'Gareth M Thomas', 'Janet M Shipley', 'Stephen J Mather', 'Daniel M Berney', 'Bryan D Young', 'Yong-Jie Lu']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Pathol""","""['New links between S-acylation and cancer.', 'New links between S-acylation and cancer.', 'Tumor-suppressive function of protein-tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 23 in testicular germ cell tumors is lost upon overexpression of miR142-3p microRNA.', 'A p53-dominant transcriptional response to cisplatin in testicular germ cell tumor-derived human embryonal carcinoma.', 'Molecular pathogenesis and prognostic factors in testicular tumor.', 'The testicular germ cell tumour transcriptome.', 'Palmitoyl acyltransferase ZDHHC7 inhibits androgen receptor and suppresses prostate cancer.', 'Repositioning Lomitapide to block ZDHHC5-dependant palmitoylation on SSTR5 leads to anti-proliferation effect in preclinical pancreatic cancer models.', 'Rare CNVs and Known Genes Linked to Macrocephaly: Review of Genomic Loci and Promising Candidate Genes.', 'Post-Translational Modifications by Lipid Metabolites during the DNA Damage Response and Their Role in Cancer.', 'Protein palmitoylation in cancer: molecular functions and therapeutic potential.']"""

We also sought to determine the optimal timing of a post-biopsy MRI. A total of 184 patients who had undergone MRI before radical prostatectomy at an institution without a predetermined schedule for MRI after a prostate biopsy were enrolled. The mean interval from the biopsy to the MRI was 30.8 ± 18.6 days. The accuracy of the MRI for simplifi ed tumor location (right, left, bilateral and none) was 44.6%. In the group with discordant pathologic and MRI fi ndings, the most common reason recorded was 'MRI predicted a unilateral lesion, but pathology revealed bilateral lesions' (58.3%), followed by 'MRI predicted no lesion, but pathology revealed the presence of a lesion' (32.0%). Multivariable analysis showed that the discordant group had a shorter interval (25.0 ± 14.3 vs 38.1 ± 20.6 days, P < 0.01) preceding the MRI and a higher rate of hemorrhage as observed by MRI (80.4% vs 54.8%, P < 0.01) in comparison with the accordant group. In receiver operating characteristics analysis, the area under the curve of the MRI interval in accurate prediction of the tumor location was 0.707 (P < 0.001). At the MRI interval's cutoff of 28.5 days, the sensitivity was 73.2% and the specificity was 63.7%.

TMPRSS2-ERG is the most common gene fusion in conventional prostatic adenocarcinoma, identified in about 40-70% of cases. In this study, we compared the expression of ERG in intraductal carcinoma of the prostate and adjacent conventional prostatic adenocarcinoma. Thirty-one confirmed cases of intraductal carcinoma of the prostate, with adjacent conventional prostatic adenocarcinoma and available tissue blocks, were identified at our institution. Immunohistochemical stains were performed for ERG using a rabbit anti-ERG monoclonal antibody. The ERG expression in the intraductal carcinoma of the prostate component was compared with that in the adjacent conventional prostatic adenocarcinoma. Mean patient age was 65 years (range: 48-79 years). Positive ERG expression was identified in 11/31 (35%) cases of intraductal carcinoma of the prostate.

However, whether it indeed helps cancer cells tolerate apoptosis stress in cancer tissues remains unknown. TFDP3 expression was assessed by RT-PCR, in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry in normal human tissues, cancer tissues and prostate cancer tissues. The association between TFDP3 and E2F1 in prostate cancer development was analyzed in various stages. Apoptosis was evaluated with annexin-V and propidium iodide staining and flow-cytometry. The results show that, in 96 samples of normal human tissues, TFDP3 could be detected in the cerebrum, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, bronchus, breast, ovary, uterus, and skin, but seldom in the lung, muscles, prostate, and liver. In addition, TFDP3 was highly expressed in numerous cancer tissues, such as brain-keratinous, lung squamous cell carcinoma, testicular seminoma, cervical carcinoma, skin squamous cell carcinoma, gastric adenocarcinoma, liver cancer, and prostate cancer. Moreover, TFDP3 was positive in 23 (62.2%) of 37 prostate cancer samples regardless of stage. Furthermore, immunohistochemistry results show that TFDP3 was always expressed in coordination with E2F1 at equivalent expression levels in prostate cancer tissues, and was highly expressed particularly in samples of high stage. When E2F1 was extrogenously expressed in LNCap cells, TFDP3 could be induced, and the apoptosis induced by E2F1 was significantly decreased. It was demonstrated that TFDP3 was a broadly expressed protein corresponding to E2F1 in human tissues, and suggested that TFDP3 is involved in prostate cancer cell survival by suppressing apoptosis induced by E2F1.""","""['Yueyun Ma', 'Yijuan Xin', 'Rui Li', 'Zhe Wang', 'Qiaohong Yue', 'Fengjing Xiao', 'Xiaoke Hao']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Gene""","""['TFDP3 as E2F Unique Partner, Has Crucial Roles in Cancer Cells and Testis.', 'Effects of TFDP3 on regulating the autophagy and apoptosis of LNCaP cells.', 'TFDP3 inhibits E2F1-induced, p53-mediated apoptosis.', 'Hypoxia inducible factor 2 alpha inhibits hepatocellular carcinoma growth through the transcription factor dimerization partner 3/ E2F transcription factor 1-dependent apoptotic pathway.', 'The E2F1/Rb and p53/MDM2 pathways in DNA repair and apoptosis: understanding the crosstalk to develop novel strategies for prostate cancer radiotherapy.', 'hMSH2 coordinated with the expression of E2F1 promotes platinum response in epithelial ovarian cancer.', 'TFDP3 as E2F Unique Partner, Has Crucial Roles in Cancer Cells and Testis.', 'Overexpression of GDP dissociation inhibitor 1 gene associates with the invasiveness and poor outcomes of colorectal cancer.', 'Cancer testis antigens in myelodysplastic syndromes revisited: a targeted RNA-seq approach.', 'Identification of prognostic risk factors for pancreatic cancer using bioinformatics analysis.']"""

We have proven that chemokine (C-C) motif ligand 2 (CCL2) is involved in the growth and invasion of PCa. In this study, we studied whether CC chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2), the receptor of CCL2, also contributes to PCa progression. We constructed the recombinant plasmid pGCsi-CCR2 and investigated the effects of pGCsi-CCR2 on proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and invasion of PC-3M cells. RT-PCR and Western blot assay showed that transfection with the plasmid pGCsi-CCR2 successfully inhibited the CCR2 expression. The cell proliferation rate was significantly slow, and the apoptotic rate was increased in PC-3M cells treated with CCR2-siRNA, indicated by MTT cell viability and TUNEL assay, respectively. As expected, CCR2 knockdown also reduced the migration and invasion of PC-3M cells, as illustrated through wound-healing assay and Transwell assay. The possible molecular mechanism was the regulation of several signal pathways involved in survival, apoptosis, migration, and metastasis.

The biological interaction between stromal (mesenchymal) stem cells (MSCs) and cancer cells remains incompletely understood. Herein, we investigated the effects of tumor cells' secreted factors as represented by a panel of human cancer cell lines (breast (MCF7 and MDA-MB-231); prostate (PC-3); lung (NCI-H522); colon (HT-29) and head & neck (FaDu)) on the biological characteristics of MSCs.  Methods:   Morphological changes were assessed using fluorescence microscopy. Changes in gene expression were assessed using Agilent microarray and qRT-PCR. GeneSpring 12.1 and DAVID tools were used for bioinformatic and signaling pathway analyses. Cell migration was assessed using a transwell migration system. SB-431542, PF-573228 and PD98059 were used to inhibit transforming growth factor β (TGFβ), focal adhesion kinase (FAK), and mitogen activated protein kinase kinase (MAPKK) pathways, respectively. Interleukin-1β (IL1β) was measured using ELISA.  Results:   MSCs exposed to secreted factors present in conditioned media (CM) from FaDu, MDA-MB-231, PC-3 and NCI-H522, but not from MCF7 and HT-29, developed an elongated, spindle-shaped morphology with bipolar processes. In association with phenotypic changes, genome-wide gene expression and bioinformatics analysis revealed an enhanced pro-inflammatory response of those MSCs. Pharmacological inhibitions of FAK and MAPKK severely impaired the pro-inflammatory response of MSCs to tumor CM (approximately 80% to 99%, and 55% to 88% inhibition, respectively), while inhibition of the TGFβ pathway was found to promote the pro-inflammatory response (approximately 3-fold increase). In addition, bioinformatics and pathway analysis of gene expression data from tumor cell lines combined with experimental validation revealed tumor-derived IL1β as one mediator of the pro-inflammatory phenotype observed in MSCs exposed to tumor CM.  Conclusions:   Our data revealed tumor-derived IL1β as one mediator of the pro-inflammatory response in MSCs exposed to tumor CM, which was found to be positively regulated by FAK and MAPK signaling and negatively regulated by TGFβ signaling. Thus, our data support a model where MSCs could promote cancer progression through becoming pro-inflammatory cells within the cancer stroma.""","""['Mashael Al-toub', 'Abdulaziz Almusa', 'Mohammed Almajed', 'May Al-Nbaheen', 'Moustapha Kassem', 'Abdullah Aldahmash', 'Nehad M Alajez']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Stem Cell Res Ther""","""['Biological effects of cancer-secreted factors on human mesenchymal stem cells.', 'CDH1 and IL1-beta expression dictates FAK and MAPKK-dependent cross-talk between cancer cells and human mesenchymal stem cells.', 'Regulation of the inflammatory profile of stromal cells in human breast cancer: prominent roles for TNF-α and the NF-κB pathway.', 'N-cadherin mediates the migration of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells toward breast tumor cells.', 'Carcinoma-Associated Mesenchymal Stem/Stromal Cells: Architects of the Pro-tumorigenic Tumor Microenvironment.', 'Assessing the effect of human mesenchymal stem cell-derived conditioned media on human cancer cell lines: A systematic review.', 'Bladder Cancer Cells Exert Pleiotropic Effects on Human Adipose-Derived Stem Cells.', 'Roles of mesenchymal stromal cells in the head and neck cancer microenvironment.', 'Association of Inflammation-Related Gene Polymorphisms With Susceptibility and Radiotherapy Sensitivity in Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma Patients in Northeast China.', 'Role of Focal Adhesion Kinase in Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma and Its Therapeutic Prospect.', 'Interaction of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cells and mesenchymal stem cells under hypoxia and normoxia.']"""

Methods:   In the current study, the stem cell characteristics were determined in cells isolated from human prostate cell lines and clinical prostate specimens based upon the ALDEFLUOR™ assay. Cells isolated based on the ALDEFLUOR™ assay were compared to cells isolated based on ATP binding cassette transporter G2 (ABCG2) activity using the side population assay. To test for stem cell characteristics of self-renewal and multipotency, cells with high and low ALDH1A1 activity, based on the ALDEFLUOR™ assay (ALDHHi and ALDH Low), were isolated from prostate clinical specimens and were recombined with rat urogenital sinus mesenchyme to induce prostate gland formation.  Results:   The percentage of ALDH Hi cells in prostate cell lines (RWPE-1, RWPE-2, CWR-R1, and DU-145) was 0.5 to 6%, similarly in non-tumor and tumor clinical specimens the percentage of ALDH Hi cells was 0.6 to 4%. Recombinants using ALDH Hi cells serially generated prostate tissue up to three generations with as few as 250 starting cells. Immunohistochemical analysis of the recombinants using ALDHHi cells contained prostatic glands frequently expressing androgen receptor (AR), p63, chromogranin A, ALDH1A1, ABCG2, and prostate specific antigen (PSA), compared to their ALDH Low counterparts. Inhibition of ALDH resulted in the reduction of sphere formation capabilities in the CWR-R1, but not in the RWPE-2 and DU-145, prostate cell lines. ABCG2 inhibition resulted in a more robust decrease of sphere formation in androgen sensitive cell lines, CWR-R1 and RWPE-2, but not androgen insensitive DU-145. ALDH1A1 expression was enriched in ALDH Hi cells and non-side population cells. ABCG2 expression was only enriched in side population cells.  Conclusions:   The percentage of ALDHHi cells in prostate cell lines and prostate tissue was consistently higher compared to cells with high ABCG2 activity, identified with the side population assay. The expression of the stem and differentiation markers indicates the ALDH Hi recombinants contained cells with self-renewal and multipotency activity. When the two assays were directly compared, cells with the side population phenotype demonstrated more stem cell potential in the tissue recombination assay compared to ALDH Hi cells. The increased stem cell potential of side population cells in the tissue recombination assay and the decrease in sphere formation when ABCG2 is inhibited indicates that the side population enriches for prostate stem cells.""","""['Kalyan J Gangavarapu', 'Gissou Azabdaftari', 'Carl D Morrison', 'Austin Miller', 'Barbara A Foster', 'Wendy J Huss']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Stem Cell Res Ther""","""['Human prostate side population cells demonstrate stem cell properties in recombination with urogenital sinus mesenchyme.', 'ABCG2-mediated DyeCycle Violet efflux defined side population in benign and malignant prostate.', 'Esophageal cancer tumorspheres involve cancer stem-like populations with elevated aldehyde dehydrogenase enzymatic activity.', 'ABCG2: a potential marker of stem cells and novel target in stem cell and cancer therapy.', 'Multidrug resistance in cancer chemotherapy and xenobiotic protection mediated by the half ATP-binding cassette transporter ABCG2.', 'Targeting aldehyde dehydrogenase for prostate cancer therapies.', 'Prostate Cancer Stem Cells: Clinical Aspects and Targeted Therapies.', 'Role of prostate stem cells and treatment strategies in benign prostate hyperplasia.', 'Expansion of mouse castration-resistant intermediate prostate stem cells in vitro.', 'Transcriptional Expressions of ALDH1A1/B1 as Independent Indicators for the Survival of Thyroid Cancer Patients.']"""

However, challenges concerning the missing information on electron density, necessary for dose calculation and patient setup on bony anatomy are introduced. This study presents a possible statistical approach to evaluate, if deviations based on MRI-only radiotherapy as compared to the CT based radiotherapy are acceptable.  Methods:   18 head-and-neck, 21 prostate, 10 vesica and 8 pelvic patients were included in the study. Data from each patient contained a CT and a T2-weighted MRI scan, a structure set and a clinically approved CT based treatment plan, which was re-calculated with identical parameters on the density corrected MRI scans. A statistical analysis including a 95% confidence interval was performed in clinically relevant DVH points.  Results:   The mean differences in the investigated DVH points were in the order of 1.5% for the PTV and up to 4.2% for organs at risk. In addition, a proposed criterion of 2% dose difference in the PTV coverage for 95% of the patients was fulfilled for all diagnostic groups for a bulk segmented MRI in the DVH points, D(median) and D2%, while only head-and-neck and prostate further fulfilled the criterion in D98%.  Conclusion:   Here, we suggested a method for establishing a reliable use of MRI-only radiotherapy. A population-based study comparing CT based dose calculations with those obtained on a suggested segmentation of MRI should be initiated and acceptable deviations in clinically relevant DVH points should be established. Such a population-based approach could form a part of the clinical commissioning of MRI-only radiotherapy.""","""['Marie E Korsholm', 'Line W Waring', 'Jens M Edmund']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Radiat Oncol""","""['An atlas-based electron density mapping method for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-alone treatment planning and adaptive MRI-based prostate radiation therapy.', 'Retrospective study comparing MR-guided radiation therapy (MRgRT) setup strategies for prostate treatment: repositioning vs. replanning.', 'MR-PROTECT: Clinical feasibility of a prostate MRI-only radiotherapy treatment workflow and investigation of acceptance criteria.', 'Regression and statistical shape model based substitute CT generation for MRI alone external beam radiation therapy from standard clinical MRI sequences.', 'Adaptive radiotherapy strategies for pelvic tumors - a systematic review of clinical implementations.', 'Synthetic computed tomography for low-field magnetic resonance-only radiotherapy in head-and-neck cancer using residual vision transformers.', 'Patient-specific quality assurance strategies for synthetic computed tomography in magnetic resonance-only radiotherapy of the abdomen.', 'Synthetic CTs for MRI-only brain RT treatment: integration of immobilization systems.', 'Synthetic computed tomography generation for abdominal adaptive radiotherapy using low-field magnetic resonance imaging.', 'Synthetic computed tomography for low-field magnetic resonance-guided radiotherapy in the abdomen.']"""

Methods:   A total of 3006 patients identified from the database of the Japan Study Group of Prostate Cancer were included in the analysis according to the following entry criteria: age of 75 years or less and stage IV disease. These patients were stratified into three groups: young (aged ≤ 55 years); middle-aged (aged ≧ 56 and ≤ 65 years); and elderly (aged ≧ 66 and ≤ 75 years). Their prognoses were analyzed both within age groups and according to whether or not there was metastasis.  Results:   The proportion of lymph node metastasis was significantly higher in the young group than in the elderly group (P = 0.007), and there were no significant differences in other factors among age groups. The overall survival rate at 5 years in the young group was significantly worse than that in the middle-aged and elderly groups (26.6%, 59.7% and 55.3%, respectively) in patients with stage IV disease with metastasis, although there was no difference among age groups in patients with stage IV disease without metastasis.

This mixed-methods study aimed to identify couples' preprostatectomy barriers to sexual recovery. Interviews about anticipated sexual recovery were paired with surveys: the Dyadic Assessment Scale, the Protective Buffering Scale, the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite, the Sexual Experience Questionnaire (men), and the Female Sexual Function Index. Potential barriers were derived using Grounded Theory. Quantitative data triangulated qualitative findings. Heterosexual couples (N = 28) participated. Men's average age was 62 years and their partners' average age was 58 years. Preexisting and diagnosis-related barriers included aging-related sexual dysfunction, inadequate sexual problem-solving skills, stressors, worry, avoidance of planning for sexual recovery, and dislike of artificially assisted sex. Participants endorsed moderate/high marital satisfaction (DAS: for men, M = 110.0, SD = 11.4; for partners, M = 114.1, SD = 12.1) and communication (PBS: for men, M = 24.5.2, SD = 6.1; for partners, M = 25.1, SD ± 6.2). Men reported mild erectile dysfunction and incontinence (EPIC sexual function M = 76.6, SD = 21.5, urinary incontinence M = 88.4, SD = 18.2). Men's couple sexual satisfaction was lowest (Sexual Experience Questionnaire: M = 60.1, SD = 26.9). Mean total Female Sexual Function Index was low (M = 21.6, SD = 7.8). Heterosexual couples face prostatectomy-related sexual side-effects having experienced developmental sexual losses. Couples use avoidant strategies to defend against worry about cancer and anticipated prostatectomy-related sexual changes.

One major mechanism mediating the hypoxic response involves up-regulation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) expression, which controls reprogramming of energy metabolism and angiogenesis. Oestrogen-related receptor-α (ERRα) is a pivotal regulator of cellular energy metabolism and many biosynthetic pathways, and has also been proposed to be an important factor promoting the Warburg effect in advanced cancer. We and others have previously shown that ERRα expression is increased in prostate cancer and is also a prognostic marker. Here we show that ERRα is oncogenic in prostate cancer and also a key hypoxic growth regulator. ERRα-over-expressing prostate cancer cells were more resistant to hypoxia and showed enhanced HIF-1α protein expression and HIF-1 signalling. These effects could also be observed in ERRα-over-expressing cells grown under normoxia, suggesting that ERRα could function to pre-adapt cancer cells to meet hypoxia stress. Immunoprecipitation and FRET assays indicated that ERRα could physically interact with HIF-1α via its AF-2 domain. A ubiquitination assay showed that this ERRα-HIF-1α interaction could inhibit ubiquitination of HIF-1α and thus reduce its degradation. Such ERRα-HIF-1α interaction could be attenuated by XCT790, an ERRα-specific inverse agonist, resulting in reduced HIF-1α levels. In summary, we show that ERRα can promote the hypoxic growth adaptation of prostate cancer cells via a protective interaction with HIF-1α, suggesting ERRα as a potential therapeutic target for cancer treatment.""","""['Chang Zou', 'Shan Yu', 'Zhenyu Xu', 'Dinglan Wu', 'Chi-Fai Ng', 'Xiaoqiang Yao', 'David T Yew', 'Jean-Marc Vanacker', 'Franky L Chan']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Pathol""","""['The Role of the Estrogen-Related Receptor Alpha (ERRa) in Hypoxia and Its Implications for Cancer Metabolism.', 'Ion channel TRPM8 promotes hypoxic growth of prostate cancer cells via an O2 -independent and RACK1-mediated mechanism of HIF-1α stabilization.', 'Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, P276-00, inhibits HIF-1α and induces G2/M arrest under hypoxia in prostate cancer cells.', 'Therapeutic delivery of siRNA silencing HIF-1 alpha with micellar nanoparticles inhibits hypoxic tumor growth.', 'Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 in human breast and prostate cancer.', 'The Role of the Estrogen-Related Receptor Alpha (ERRa) in Hypoxia and Its Implications for Cancer Metabolism.', 'Multifaceted Transcriptional Network of Estrogen-Related Receptor Alpha in Health and Disease.', 'Estrogens revert neutrophil hyperplasia by inhibiting Hif1α-cMyb pathway in zebrafish myelodysplastic syndromes models.', 'Long noncoding RNA MIR210HG is induced by hypoxia-inducible factor 1α and promotes cervical cancer progression.', 'Role of HIF-1α/ERRα in Enhancing Cancer Cell Metabolism and Promoting Resistance of Endometrial Cancer Cells to Pyroptosis.']"""

In the current study, we investigated whether MHY-449 has anticancer effect in prostate cancer cells, and if so, what the molecular mechanisms are. We examined the growth inhibitory effect of MHY-449 on p53 wild‑type (p53-wt) LNCaP (androgen‑dependent) and p53-null PC3 (androgen-independent) prostate cancer cells. MHY-449 treatment in androgen-independent and p53-null PC3 cells resulted in inhibition of cell growth and induction of apoptosis in a concentration-dependent manner. However, MHY-449 did not show any significant effects on the growth inhibition and apoptotic cell death in androgen-dependent and p53-wt LNCaP cells. Therefore, we used PC3 cells for further studies. The induction of apoptosis in PC3 cells was observed by decreased viability, DNA fragmentation, cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase, activations of caspase-3, -8 and -9, and alteration in the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 protein expression. In addition, MHY-449 induced increase of late apoptosis and sub-G1 DNA which were observed by flow cytometry analysis. Furthermore, MHY-449 reduced the phosphorylation of Akt and FoxO1 and induced the translocation of FoxO1 from cytoplasm to nucleus as shown by western blot analysis. MHY-449 treatment activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling in a concentration-dependent manner. MHY-449-induced apoptosis was partially prevented by pretreatment with the ERK inhibitor PD98059 suggesting involvement of ERK in the MHY-449-induced apoptosis.

Prostate‑specific membrane antigen (PSMA) has been validated as an important tumor marker for prostate cancer progression including angiogenesis and metastasis. As a type II membrane protein, PSMA can be constitutively internalized from the cell surface into endosomes. Early endosomes can fuse with multivesicular bodies (MVB) to form and secrete exosomes (40-100 nm) into the extracellular environment. Herein, we tested whether some of the endosomal PSMA could be transferred to exosomes as an extracellular resource for PSMA. Using PSMA-positive LNCaP cells, the secreted exosomes were collected and isolated from the cultured media. The vesicular structures of exosomes were identified by electron microscopy, and exosomal marker protein CD9 and tumor susceptibility gene (TSG 101) were confirmed by western blot analysis. Our present data demonstrate that PSMA can be enriched in exosomes, exhibiting a higher content of glycosylation and partial proteolysis in comparison to cellular PSMA.

During malignant transformation, normal epithelial cells undergo genetic and morphological changes known as epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Several regulatory genes and specific marker proteins are involved in PC EMT. Recently, syndecans have been associated with malignancy grade and Gleason score in PC. Considering that SNAIL is mainly a gene repressor increased in PC and that syndecan promoters have putative binding sites for this repressor, we propose that SNAIL might regulate syndecan expression during PC EMT. The aim of this study was to analyze immunochemically the expression of SNAIL, syndecans 1 and 2 and other EMT markers in a tissue microarray (TMA) of PC samples and PC cell lines. The TMAs included PC samples of different Gleason grade and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) samples, as non‑malignant controls. PC3 and LNCaP cell lines were used as models of PC representing different tumorigenic capacities. Semi-quantitative immunohistochemistry was performed on TMAs and fluorescence immunocytochemistry and western blot analysis were conducted on cell cultures. Results show that SNAIL exhibits increased expression in high Gleason specimens compared to low histological grade and BPH samples. Accordingly, PC3 cells show higher SNAIL expression levels compared to LNCaP cells. Conversely, syndecan 1, similarly to E-cadherin (a known marker of EMT), shows a decreased expression in high Gleason grades samples and PC3 cells. Interestingly, syndecan 2 shows no changes associated to histological grade. It is concluded that increased SNAIL levels in advanced PC are associated with low expression of syndecan 1. The mechanism by which SNAIL regulates the expression of syndecan 1 remains to be investigated.""","""['Cristian E Poblete', 'Juan Fulla', 'Marcela Gallardo', 'Valentina Muñoz', 'Enrique A Castellón', 'Ivan Gallegos', 'Hector R Contreras']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Int J Oncol""","""['SNAIL expression correlates with the translocation of syndecan‑1 intracellular domain into the nucleus in prostate cancer cell lines.', 'Syndecan-1 up-regulates microRNA-331-3p and mediates epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in prostate cancer.', 'The expression of syndecan-1 and -2 is associated with Gleason score and epithelial-mesenchymal transition markers, E-cadherin and beta-catenin, in prostate cancer.', 'Syndecans in the diagnosis and prognosis of prostate cancer.', 'The role of Snail in prostate cancer.', 'Cancer Stemness/Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition Axis Influences Metastasis and Castration Resistance in Prostate Cancer: Potential Therapeutic Target.', 'Proteoglycans Determine the Dynamic Landscape of EMT and Cancer Cell Stemness.', 'Molecular mechanisms of neuroendocrine differentiation in prostate cancer progression.', 'Syndecan-1 (CD138), Carcinomas and EMT.', 'Increased Cytoplasmic CD138 Expression Is Associated with Aggressive Characteristics in Prostate Cancer and Is an Independent Predictor for Biochemical Recurrence.']"""

In the present study, we investigated the association between common polymorphisms in the genes for FAS and FASL and the risk of late side effects after radiotherapy for prostate cancer.  Patients and methods:   The role of FAS (- 1377G > A, rs2234767 and - 670A > G, rs1800682) and FASL (- 844C > T, rs763110) gene polymorphisms in the development of high-grade late rectal and/or urinary toxicity (defined as late toxicity EORTC/RTOG grade ≥ 2) was analyzed in 607 prostate cancer patients treated with radiotherapy. DNA was isolated and the selected polymorphisms were determined by 5'-nuclease (TaqMan) assays.  Results:   After a median follow-up time of 82 months, high-grade late rectal and/or urinary toxicity was observed in 175 patients (29.7 %). Univariate analysis revealed a significantly decreased risk of high-grade late toxicity in carriers of the FASL - 844T allele. After adjusting for covariates, patients harboring at least one - 844T allele (CT or TT genotype) remained at decreased risk of high-grade late toxicity compared with patients harboring the CC genotype [hazard ratio (HR) 0.585, 95 %CI 0.39-0.878; p = 0.010]. For patients with the - 844TT genotype, the HR was 0.404 (95 %CI 0.171-0.956; p = 0.039) in multivariate analysis. No significant associations were found for the remaining polymorphisms analyzed.

Therefore, the consequences of translational positioning corrections and of morphological changes in the patient anatomy can be quantified for prostate cancer patients.  Materials and methods:   The organs at risk were newly contoured on the CBCT data sets of 7 patients so as to evaluate the actual applied dose. The daily dose to the planning target volume (PTV) was recalculated with and without the translation data, which result from the real patient repositioning.  Results:   A CBCT-based dose recalculation with uncertainties less than 3 % is possible. The deviations between the planning CT and the CBCT without the translational positioning correction vector show an average dose difference of - 8 % inside the PTV. An inverse proportional relation between the mean bladder dose and the actual volume of the bladder could be established. The daily applied dose to the rectum is about 1-54 % higher than predicted by the planning CT.  Conclusion:   A dose calculation based on CBCT data is possible. The daily positioning correction of the patient is necessary to avoid an underdosage in the PTV.

Purpose:   The aim of this study is to determine whether a 3-month supervised resistance exercise program results in any sustained functional benefits in prostate and breast cancer patients with bone metastatic disease.  Methods:   Twenty men and women with bone metastatic disease secondary to prostate or breast cancer completed a 3-month supervised resistance exercise program followed by a 6-month observation period. Outcomes were assessed at baseline, post-exercise, and 6-month follow-up.  Results:   Fourteen participants completed the follow-up observation period. Significant improvements in physical function (4-6 %), physical activity levels (~160 min/week), lean mass (3-4 %), and quality of life (5-7 %) were observed at the completion of the exercise program. At the 6-month follow-up, significant improvements in ambulation (4 %), physical activity level (~105 min/week), whole body lean mass (2 %), and quality of life (13 %) remained.  Conclusions:   An appropriately designed and supervised 3-month resistance exercise program may lead to significant improvements in functional ability, physical activity level, lean mass, and quality of life that remain 6 months after completion of the program in cancer patients with bone metastases.

However, ASCs can exert profound effects on biological behavior of tumor cells. Our study aimed to examine the influence of ASCs on gene expression and epigenetic methylation profiles of prostate cancer cells as well as the impact of expressing a therapeutic gene on modifying the interaction between ASCs and prostate cancer cells.  Methods:   ASCs were modified by lentiviral transduction to express either green fluorescent protein as a control or pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) as a therapeutic molecule. PC3 prostate cancer cells were cultured in the presence of ASC culture-conditioned media (CCM), and effects on PC3 or DU145. Ras cells were examined by means of real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, EpiTect methyl prostate cancer-focused real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction arrays, and luciferase reporter assays.  Results:   ASCs transduced with lentiviral vectors were able to mediate expression of several tumor-inhibitory genes, some of which correlated with epigenetic methylation changes on cocultured PC3 prostate cancer cells. When PC3 cells were cultured with ASC-PEDF CCM, we observed a shift in the balance of gene expression toward tumor inhibition, which suggests that PEDF reduces the potential tumor-promoting activity of unmodified ASCs.  Conclusions:   These results suggest that ASC-PEDF CCM can promote reprogramming of tumor cells in a paracrine manner. An improved understanding of genetic and epigenetic events in prostate cancer growth in response to PEDF paracrine therapy would enable a more effective use of ASC-PEDF, with the goal of achieving safer yet more potent anti-tumor effects.""","""['Olga Zolochevska', 'Joseph Shearer', 'Jayne Ellis', 'Valentina Fokina', 'Forum Shah', 'Jeffrey M Gimble', 'Marxa L Figueiredo']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Cytotherapy""","""['Pigment epithelial-derived factor and melanoma differentiation associated gene-7 cytokine gene therapies delivered by adipose-derived stromal/mesenchymal stem cells are effective in reducing prostate cancer cell growth.', 'Exosomes derived from PEDF modified adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells ameliorate cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury by regulation of autophagy and apoptosis.', 'Therapeutic potential of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells producing pigment epithelium-derived factor in lung carcinoma.', 'Cancer cell apoptotic pathways mediated by PEDF: prospects for therapy.', 'The increasing role of pigment epithelium-derived factor in metastasis: from biological importance to a promising target.', 'Pigment Epithelium-Derived Factor and Sex Hormone-Responsive Cancers.', 'Tumor-Targeted Immunotherapy by Using Primary Adipose-Derived Stem Cells and an Antigen-Specific Protein Vaccine.', 'Epigenome-wide DNA methylation profiling of periprostatic adipose tissue in prostate cancer patients with excess adiposity-a pilot study.', 'A dock derived compound against laminin receptor (37 LR) exhibits anti-cancer properties in a prostate cancer cell line model.', 'Corneal Mesenchymal Stromal Cells Are Directly Antiangiogenic via PEDF and sFLT-1.']"""

Methods:   The 385 patients included were invited to complete a 26-symptom questionnaire 3 and 6 months after the start of treatment, among which eighteen symptoms were also assessed by physicians, reported in medical records and graded using the Common Toxicity Criteria of the National Cancer Institute. Positive and negative agreements as well as Kappa concordance coefficients were computed.  Findings:   Data were available for 220 and 165 patients at 3 and 6 months respectively. Physicians systematically under-reported patients' symptoms. Positive agreement rates (at respectively 3 and 6 months) for the five most commonly reported symptoms were: 61.0% and 64.3% hot flushes, 50.0% and 43.6% fatigue, 29.4% and 31.1% sexual dysfunction, 24.4% and 14.4% weigh gain/loss, 16.7% and 19.3% for joint/muscle pain.

To determine whether the human prostate is similarly sensitive to BPA, the current study used human prostate epithelial stem-like cells cultured from prostates of young, disease-free donors. Similar to estradiol-17β (E2), BPA increased stem-progenitor cell self-renewal and expression of stem-related genes in a dose-dependent manner. Further, 10 nM BPA and E2 possessed equimolar membrane-initiated signaling with robust induction of p-Akt and p-Erk at 15 minutes. To assess in vivo carcinogenicity, human prostate stem-progenitor cells combined with rat mesenchyme were grown as renal grafts in nude mice, forming normal human prostate epithelium at 1 month. Developmental BPA exposure was achieved through oral administration of 100 or 250 μg BPA/kg body weight to hosts for 2 weeks after grafting, producing free BPA levels of 0.39 and 1.35 ng/mL serum, respectively. Carcinogenesis was driven by testosterone plus E2 treatment for 2 to 4 months to model rising E2 levels in aging men. The incidence of high-grade prostate intraepithelial neoplasia and adenocarcinoma markedly increased from 13% in oil-fed controls to 33% to 36% in grafts exposed in vivo to BPA (P < .05). Continuous developmental BPA exposure through in vitro (200 nM) plus in vivo (250 μg/kg body weight) treatments increased high-grade prostate intraepithelial neoplasia/cancer incidence to 45% (P < .01).

Insufficient evidence of the mechanisms by which GATA2 contributes to this process precludes complete understanding of a key determinant of tissue-specific AR activity. Our observations suggest that GATA2 facilitates androgen-responsive gene expression by three distinct modes of action. By occupying novel binding sites within the AR gene locus, GATA2 positively regulates AR expression before and after androgen stimulation. Additionally, GATA2 engages AR target gene enhancers prior to hormone stimulation, producing an active and accessible chromatin environment via recruitment of the histone acetyltransferase p300. Finally, GATA2 functions in establishing and/or sustaining basal locus looping by recruiting the Mediator subunit MED1 in the absence of androgen. These mechanisms may contribute to the generally positive role of GATA2 in defining AR genome-wide binding patterns that determine androgen-responsive gene expression profiles.

The measurements were performed using standard detector density (standard resolution; SR) and a doubled detector density (high resolution; HR) by merging regular with shifted measurements. SR and HR measurements were fed into the 3DVH software and ROI (region of interest), planning target volume (PTV), and organ at risk (OAR)) dose statistics (D95, Dmean, and Dmax) were determined for each. Differences of the dose statistics normalized to prescription dose for ROIs between original planning and PDP-perturbed planning were calculated for SR (ΔDSR) and HR (ΔDHR), and difference between ΔDSR and ΔDHR (ΔDSR-HR = ΔDSR - ΔDHR) was also calculated. In addition, 2D and 3D γ passing rates (GPRs) were determined for both resolutions, and a correlation between GPRs and ΔDSR or ΔDHR for PTV dose metrics was determined. No considerably high mean differences between ΔDSR and ΔDHR were found for almost all ROIs and plans (&lt; 2%); however, |ΔDSR|, |ΔDHR|, and |ΔDSR-HR| for PTV were found to significantly increase as the PTV size decreased (e.g., PTV size &lt; 5 cc). And statistically significant differences between SR and HR were observed for OARs proximal to targets in large brain target and H&amp;N cases. As plan modulation represented by fractional MU/prescription dose (MU/cGy) became more complex, the 2D/3D GPRs tended to decrease; however, the modulation complexity did not make any noticeable distinctions in the DVH statistics of PTV between SR and HR, excluding the small brain cases whose PTVs were extremely small (PTV = 11.0 ± 10.1 cc). Moderate to strong negative correlations (-1 &lt; r &lt; -0.3) between GPRs and PTV dose metrics indicated that small clinical errors for PTV occur at the higher GPRs. In conclusion, doubling the detector density of the MapCHECK 2 device is recommended for small targets (i.e., PTV &lt; 5 cc) and multiple targets with complex geometry with minimum setup error in the DVH-based plan evaluation.""","""['Vance P Keeling', 'Salahuddin Ahmad', 'Ozer Algan', 'Hosang Jin']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Appl Clin Med Phys""","""['Initial experience of ArcCHECK and 3DVH software for RapidArc treatment plan verification.', '3D DVH-based metric analysis versus per-beam planar analysis in IMRT pretreatment verification.', 'Accuracy of one algorithm used to modify a planned DVH with data from actual dose delivery.', 'Analysis of direct clinical consequences of MLC positional errors in volumetric-modulated arc therapy using 3D dosimetry system.', 'Robust optimization in lung treatment plans accounting for geometric uncertainty.', 'Comprehensive evaluation of the high-resolution diode array for SRS dosimetry.', 'Evaluating the Impact of Various Parameters on the Gamma Index Values of 2D Diode Array in IMRT Verification.', 'Three-dimensional dose prediction and validation with the radiobiological gamma index based on a relative seriality model for head-and-neck IMRT.', 'Organ-specific modulation complexity score for the evaluation of dose delivery.', 'Evaluation of the radiobiological gamma index with motion interplay in tangential IMRT breast treatment.']"""

Therefore, in this region is extremely important to study the possible impact of adverse environmental factors on the occurrence of pathological processes, especially cancer in the population. The aim of the study was to investigate the possible factors influencing the prostate cancer morbidity among the general population in different areas of Sumy region. Screening analysis of prostate cancer morbidity among the population of Sumy region was conducted and the data of the Sumy Regional Oncology Center on the prevalence of cancer among the population of the Sumy region in the last 10 years were studied. The environmental situation of the Sumy region in recent years was studied; areas with the highest pollution of surface waters and soils were identified. Comparison of pollution of Sumy regions and prostate cancer morbidity were conducted The study of the ecological situation in Sumy region and analysis of the level of environmental pollution in some areas showed that the highest incidence of prostate cancer observed in areas with poor ecological state of water resources and soil.

This amoeboid transformation is accompanied by increased tumor cell migration, invasion, and metastasis. DIAPH3 silencing also promotes the formation of atypically large (> 1 μm) membrane blebs that can be shed as extracellular vesicles (EV) containing bioactive cargo. Whether loss of DIAPH3 also stimulates the release of nano-sized EV (e.g., exosomes) is not established. Here we examined the mechanism of release and potential biological functions of EV shed from DIAPH3-silenced and other prostate cancer cells. We observed that stimulation of LNCaP cells with the prostate stroma-derived growth factor heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF), combined with p38MAPK inhibition caused EV shedding, a process mediated by ERK1/2 hyperactivation. DIAPH3 silencing in DU145 cells also increased rates of EV production. EV isolated from DIAPH3-silenced cells activated AKT1 and androgen signaling, increased proliferation of recipient tumor cells, and suppressed proliferation of human macrophages and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. DU145 EV contained miR-125a, which suppressed AKT1 expression and proliferation in recipient human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and macrophages. Our findings suggest that EV produced as a result of DIAPH3 loss or growth factor stimulation may condition the tumor microenvironment through multiple mechanisms, including the proliferation of cancer cells and suppression of tumor-infiltrating immune cells.""","""['Jayoung Kim', 'Samantha Morley', 'Minh Le', 'Denis Bedoret', 'Dale T Umetsu', 'Dolores Di Vizio', 'Michael R Freeman']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Cancer Biol Ther""","""['Oncosome formation in prostate cancer: association with a region of frequent chromosomal deletion in metastatic disease.', 'DIAPH3 governs the cellular transition to the amoeboid tumour phenotype.', 'High-density lipoprotein induces proliferation and migration of human prostate androgen-independent cancer cells by an ABCA1-dependent mechanism.', 'Role of Exosomes in Prostate Cancer Metastasis.', 'Application of extracellular vesicles in the diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer: Implications for clinical practice.', 'Folylpolyglutamate synthetase mRNA G-quadruplexes regulate its cell protrusion localization and enhance a cancer cell invasive phenotype upon folate repletion.', 'Extracellular signals regulate the biogenesis of extracellular vesicles.', 'CircRNA/miRNA/mRNA axis participates in the progression of partial bladder outlet obstruction.', 'Exosomal MicroRNAs as Novel Cell-Free Therapeutics in Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine.', 'Role of extracellular vesicles in osteosarcoma.']"""

Nonetheless, there are considerable concerns about its indiscriminate use as a surrogate endpoint for cell growth or survival. We hypothesized that treatment with a luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) analog would decrease PSA levels even in the absence of malignant disease.  Methods:   We determined testosterone and PSA levels in 30 healthy volunteers after a single intramuscular injection of a LHRH depot formulation. Testosterone and PSA levels were quantified by radioimmunoassay and electrochemi-luminescence immunoassay, respectively.  Results:   After an initial flare-up during the first 3 days testosterone decreased reaching castration levels in 18 of the 30 young men (60%). After the nadir on day 28, testosterone levels increased to normal again. Changes in PSA paralleled those of testosterone. Castration reduced PSA levels by 29% (95% CI 19%-39%) compared to baseline (p<0.0001).  Conclusions:   LHRH superagonists decrease PSA levels by testosterone deprivation. Conferring these findings to tumor patients, decreases in PSA after treatment with LHRH analogs might not only reflect disease regression but also a direct testosterone mediated effect on PSA.

Methods:   A total of 286 patients with organ-confined prostate cancer and a preoperative prostate volume that could be estimated by transrectal ultrasound underwent laparoscopic radical prostatectomy between 2006 and 2011 at our institution. We examined whether NHT was associated with pneumoperitoneum time (PT) or estimated blood loss during laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.  Results:   NHT was performed in 80 patients; the mean duration of NHT was 5.2 ± 0.2 months. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that history of NHT and no NHT were not independent predictors of prolonged PT or higher estimated blood loss. Next, we evaluated 57 patients whose estimated preoperative baseline prostate volume was over 50 mL. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that no history of NHT (P = 0.011) was an independent predictor of prolonged PT. PT was significantly shorter in the NHT group (164.5 ± 39.0 min, n = 26) than in the non-NHT group (184.0 ± 36.7 min, n = 31) (P = 0.048). In the NHT group, mean prostate volume was reduced from 63.7 ± 16.0 mL to 42.1 ± 18.6 mL (33.9% reduction) by NHT.

To date, there have been no published data regarding the role of NUCB2 protein expression in prostate cancer (PCa). Therefore, this study was performed to investigate the correlations between NUCB2 protein expression and prognosis in patients with PCa.  Methods:   Through immunohistochemistry, NUCB2 protein expression was evaluated in 60 benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) specimens and 180 PCa specimens. The correlation of NUCB2 protein expression with clinicopathological parameters was assessed using χ2 analysis. Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to investigate the correlation between NUCB2 protein expression and prognosis of PCa patients.  Results:   The immunohistochemistry results showed that the expression level of NUCB2 in PCa cases was significantly higher than that in BPH tissues (P < 0.001). Moreover, statistical analysis also showed that high NUCB2 protein expression was positively related to seminal vesicle invasion, lymph node metastasis, angiolymphatic invasion, higher Gleason score, biochemical recurrence (BCR), and higher preoperative prostate-specific antigen (PSA). Furthermore, it was also shown that patients with high NUCB2 protein expression had significantly poorer overall survival and BCR- free survival compared with patients with low expression of NUCB2 protein. Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that high NUCB2 protein expression level was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival and BCR-free survival of patients with PCa.  Conclusions:   NUCB2 protein expression showed a strong association with the potencies of BCR and progression of PCa, and that may be applied as a novel biomarker for the prediction of BCR, and helpful for improving the diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of PCa.""","""['Hongtuan Zhang', 'Can Qi', 'Andi Wang', 'Bing Yao', 'Liang Li', 'Yuzhuo Wang', 'Yong Xu']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""J Exp Clin Cancer Res""","""['NUCB2: roles in physiology and pathology.', 'Clinical significance of NUCB2 mRNA expression in prostate cancer.', 'High expression of nucleobindin 2 mRNA: an independent prognostic factor for overall survival of patients with prostate cancer.', 'Overexpression of LAPTM4B-35: a novel marker of poor prognosis of prostate cancer.', 'Semen as a rich source of diagnostic biomarkers for prostate cancer: latest evidence and implications.', 'Ki-67, topoisomerase IIα and miR-221 have a limited prostate cancer risk stratification ability on a medium-term follow-up: results of a high-risk radical prostatectomy cohort.', 'NUCB2: roles in physiology and pathology.', 'Nucleobindin-2/Nesfatin-1-A New Cancer Related Molecule?', 'The Multifaceted Nature of Nucleobindin-2 in Carcinogenesis.', 'Nucleobindin-2 enhances the epithelial-mesenchymal transition in renal cell carcinoma.']"""

Methods:   From 2009 to 2011, 40 patients with high-risk prostate cancer after prostatectomy with pT3 R0/1 M0 or pT2 R1 M0 or a PSA recurrence and either > 20% risk of lymph node involvement and inadequate lymphadenectomy or pN + were enrolled. Patients received two months of antihormonal treatment (AT) before radiotherapy. AT continuation was mandatory during radiotherapy and was recommended for another two years. IMRT of the pelvic lymph nodes (51.0 Gy) with a simultaneous integrated boost to the prostate bed (68.0 Gy) was performed in 34 fractions.

Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped by using PCR followed by restriction fragment length (PCR-RFLP) analysis. We conducted meta-analysis of published studies regarding association of these SNPs with PCa risk. Evidence of positive association between the AC genotype of the SNP rs3760511 and BPH risk for the best-fitting overdominant model of association (BPH vs. controls comparison, p = 0.026; odds ratio [OR] = 1.58; 95% confidence interval [95%CI] 1.05-2.36) were obtained. The association between T allele of rs7501939 and PCa risk was determined in PCa versus controls comparison (p = 0.0032; OR = 0.66, 95%CI 0.50-0.87) with the best-fitting model of inheritance being log-additive. This variant was also found to be associated with the risk of BPH (p = 0.0023; OR = 0.65, 95%CI 0.49-0.86). We found no association between parameters of PCa progression and the analyzed SNPs. Meta-analysis showed strong association between these variants and PCa risk. Our study shows association between SNPs at locus 17q12 and the risk of prostatic diseases in Serbian population.

Methods:   One hundred and forty-five patients with localized prostate cancer (Tlb-T2c) underwent laparoscopic radical prostatectomy in our center from July 2006 to May 2010, including 59 cases treated with bladder neck preservation (BNP group) and 86 cases with bladder neck resection (non-BNP group). All cases were diagnosed as prostate cancer by transrectal ultrasonography-guided prostate biopsy preoperatively, in which localized tumors were confirmed by CT or MRI and distant metastases were ruled out by ECT bone scan. All patients had no history of incontinence and no radiation therapy preoperatively. All the 145 operations were performed by the same surgeon. The bladder neck preservation was defined as a procedure of direct suturing of the bladder neck on the urethra without repair and reconstruction of the bladder neck. Both procedures of neurovascular bundle preservation and external striated urethral sphincter preservation were carried out on all cases. Urinary continence was evaluated using the International Continence Society questionnaire at 1, 3 and 6 months postoperatively. Positive surgical margins rates were compared between the two groups. Postoperative continence was defined as the absence of need for pads or the use of one pad daily.  Results:   At 1, 3 and 6 months, the urinary continence rates were 42.4%, 74.6% and 86.4% in BNP group, respectively, while 25.6%, 58.1% and 80.2% in non-BNP group, respectively. There were statistically significant differences in continence at 1 and 3 months between two groups (P <0.05), while no significant differences were observed at 6 months postoperatively (P=0.331). There were no significant differences in overall rate of positive surgical margins between two groups (10.1% Compared with 10.4% P=0.954) and both groups had one case with positive surgical margins at bladder neck.

Methods:   We used the Clinical Practice Research Datalink and linked English Hospital Episode Statistics to perform a population-based cohort study. Adult incident cases with a diagnosis of cirrhosis between January 1998 and December 2009 were identified. We described trends in incidence by sex and etiology. We performed a direct standardization to estimate the number of people being newly diagnosed with cirrhosis in 2009, and calculated the change in incidence between 1998 and 2009.  Results:   A total of 5,118 incident cases of cirrhosis were identified, 57.9% were male. Over the 12-year period, crude incidence increased by 50.6%. Incidence increased for both men and women and all etiology types.

Cancer mortality rates in the population do not accomplish this objective. We sought a measure that would reveal the effects of changing mortality rates from other diseases.  Methods:   We obtained annual breast, colorectal, lung, and prostate cancer mortality rates from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registries; we obtained noncancer mortality rates from national death certificates, 1975 to 2005. We used life-table methods to calculate the burden of cancer mortality as the average person-years of life lost (PYLL) as a result of cancer (cancer-specific PYLL) and quantify individual-and perhaps offsetting-contributions of the two factors that affect cancer-specific PYLL: mortality rates as a result of cancer and other-cause mortality.  Results:   Falling cancer mortality rates reduced the burden of mortality from leading cancers, but increasing cancer incidence as a result of decreasing other-cause mortality rates partially offset this progress. Between 1985 and 1989 and between 2000 and 2004, the burden of lung cancer in males declined by 0.1 year of life lost. This decline reflects the sum of two effects: decreasing lung cancer mortality rates that reduced the average burden of lung cancer mortality by 0.33 years of life lost and declining other-cause mortality rates that raised it by 0.23 years. Other common cancers showed similar patterns.  Conclusion:   By using a measure that accounts for increased cancer incidence as a result of improvements in CVD mortality, we find that prior assessments have underestimated the impact of cancer interventions.""","""['Samir Soneji', 'Hiram Beltrán-Sánchez', 'Harold C Sox']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Clin Oncol""","""['Annual Report to the Nation on the Status of Cancer, 1975-2012, featuring the increasing incidence of liver cancer.', 'Estimates and projections of value of life lost from cancer deaths in the United States.', 'Recent cancer trends in the United States.', 'Annual report to the nation on the status of cancer, 1975-2000, featuring the uses of surveillance data for cancer prevention and control.', 'Aspirin Use in Adults: Cancer, All-Cause Mortality, and Harms: A Systematic Evidence Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.', 'Development of a nomogram for preoperative prediction of lymph node metastasis in non-small cell lung cancer: a SEER-based study.', 'Incorporating competing risk theory into evaluations of changes in cancer survival: making the most of cause of death and routinely linked sociodemographic data.', 'Evolution of Cancer Pharmacological Treatments at the Turn of the Third Millennium.', 'Benchmarking life expectancy and cancer mortality: global comparison with cardiovascular disease 1981-2010.', 'Use of the Prostate Core Mitomic Test in Repeated Biopsy Decision-Making: Real-World Assessment of Clinical Utility in a Multicenter Patient Population.']"""

Methods:   Expression analysis of RasGRP3 was accomplished using immunohistochemical staining of PCa and BPH tissues. Pearson's χ2 test was used to analyze the association between RasGRP3 expression and specific clinical parameters. Survival and PSA relapse curves were evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank tests, and the differences were assessed using the Cox regression methods. In addition, human PCa cell lines PC-3, DU145, LNCaP, PC3M-1E8, PC3M-2B4 and BPH-1 were examined for expression of RasGRP3 using western blot and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR) analysis. After PC-3 cells were transfected by small interfering RNA targeting RasGRP3, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide and migratory assays were employed to determine the vitality and aggressive capability of tumor cell in vitro.  Results:   Expression of RasGRP3 was significantly correlated (P=0.038 and P=0.021) with Gleason score (< or =6 versus > or =7) and T stage (T1-T2 versus T3-T4), respectively. PCa with RasGRP3-positive expression may increase the risk of PSA recurrence and decrease cancer-specific survival (P=0.0291 and P=0.0044). The expression of RasGRP3 was also associated with PSA recurrence and cancer-specific survival in univariate (P<0.001 and P<0.001) and multivariate analyses (P<0.001 and P=0.003). RasGRP3 mRNA and proteins were found to be positively expressed in PCa cell lines. There was higher expression of RasGRP3 in PC-3, DU145 and PC3M-1E8 than in LNCaP, PC3M-2B4 and BPH-1. Knockdown of RasGRP3 inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasion capabilities of PC-3 cells.  Conclusions:   These data suggested that elevated RasGRP3 expression may play a key role in the malignant progression of PCa, especially in invasion and metastasis, and may be a potential marker of biochemical recurrence.""","""['X Zeng', 'Z Hu', 'Z Wang', 'J Tao', 'T Lu', 'C Yang', 'B Lee', 'Z Ye']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['PPM1D as a novel biomarker for prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy.', 'Human antigen R is positively associated with malignant aggressiveness via upregulation of cell proliferation, migration, and vascular endothelial growth factors and cyclooxygenase-2 in prostate cancer.', 'Golgi phosphoprotein\xa03 expression predicts poor prognosis in patients with prostate cancer undergoing radical prostatectomy.', 'Upregulation of Talin-1 expression associates with advanced pathological features and predicts lymph node metastases and biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer.', 'Defining prostate cancer risk after radical prostatectomy.', 'Advances in Molecular Regulation of Prostate Cancer Cells by Top Natural Products of Malaysia.', 'UBE2S as a novel ubiquitinated regulator of p16 and β-catenin to promote bone metastasis of prostate cancer.', 'Ras and Wnt Interaction Contribute in Prostate Cancer Bone Metastasis.', 'Cancer Stem Cells: Emergent Nature of Tumor Emergency.', 'Importance of the REM (Ras exchange) domain for membrane interactions by RasGRP3.']"""

Orteronel (TAK-700) is an investigational, oral, nonsteroidal, selective, reversible inhibitor of 17,20-lyase, a key enzyme in the production of androgenic hormones.  Experimental design:   We conducted a phase I/II study in men with progressive, chemotherapy-naïve, metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, and serum testosterone <50 ng/dL. In the phase I part, patients received orteronel 100 to 600 mg twice daily or 400 mg twice a day plus prednisone 5 mg twice a day. In phase II, patients received orteronel 300 mg twice a day, 400 mg twice a day plus prednisone, 600 mg twice a day plus prednisone, or 600 mg once a day without prednisone.  Results:   In phase I (n = 26), no dose-limiting toxicities were observed and 13 of 20 evaluable patients (65%) achieved ≥50% prostate-specific antigen (PSA) decline from baseline at 12 weeks. In phase II (n = 97), 45 of 84 evaluable patients (54%) achieved a ≥50% decline in PSA and at 12 weeks, substantial mean reductions from baseline in testosterone (-7.5 ng/dL) and dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate (-45.3 μg/dL) were observed. Unconfirmed partial responses were reported in 10 of 51 evaluable phase II patients (20%). Decreases in circulating tumor cells were documented. Fifty-three percent of phase II patients experienced grade ≥3 adverse events irrespective of causality; most common were fatigue, hypokalemia, hyperglycemia, and diarrhea.

Segmentation is useful for various tasks, e.g. to accurately localize prostate boundaries for radiotherapy or to initialize multi-modal registration algorithms. In the past, it has been difficult for research groups to evaluate prostate segmentation algorithms on multi-center, multi-vendor and multi-protocol data. Especially because we are dealing with MR images, image appearance, resolution and the presence of artifacts are affected by differences in scanners and/or protocols, which in turn can have a large influence on algorithm accuracy. The Prostate MR Image Segmentation (PROMISE12) challenge was setup to allow a fair and meaningful comparison of segmentation methods on the basis of performance and robustness. In this work we will discuss the initial results of the online PROMISE12 challenge, and the results obtained in the live challenge workshop hosted by the MICCAI2012 conference. In the challenge, 100 prostate MR cases from 4 different centers were included, with differences in scanner manufacturer, field strength and protocol. A total of 11 teams from academic research groups and industry participated. Algorithms showed a wide variety in methods and implementation, including active appearance models, atlas registration and level sets. Evaluation was performed using boundary and volume based metrics which were combined into a single score relating the metrics to human expert performance. The winners of the challenge where the algorithms by teams Imorphics and ScrAutoProstate, with scores of 85.72 and 84.29 overall. Both algorithms where significantly better than all other algorithms in the challenge (p<0.05) and had an efficient implementation with a run time of 8min and 3s per case respectively. Overall, active appearance model based approaches seemed to outperform other approaches like multi-atlas registration, both on accuracy and computation time. Although average algorithm performance was good to excellent and the Imorphics algorithm outperformed the second observer on average, we showed that algorithm combination might lead to further improvement, indicating that optimal performance for prostate segmentation is not yet obtained.

In prostate cancer ERG protooncogene frequently gains hormonal control by seizing gene regulatory elements of TMPRSS2 through genomic fusion events. Although, the androgenic activation of TMPRSS2 gene has been established, little is known about other elements that may interact with TMPRSS2 promoter sequences to modulate ERG expression in TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion context.  Methods:   Comparative genomic analyses of the TMPRSS2 promoter upstream sequences and pathway analyses were performed by the Genomatix Software. NKX3.1 and ERG genes expressions were evaluated by immunoblot or by quantitative Real-Time PCR (qRT-PCR) assays in response to siRNA knockdown or heterologous expression. QRT-PCR assay was used for monitoring the gene expression levels of NKX3.1-regulated genes. Transcriptional regulatory function of NKX3.1 was assessed by luciferase assay. Recruitment of NKX3.1 to its cognate elements was monitored by Chromatin Immunoprecipitation assay.  Results:   Comparative analysis of the TMPRSS2 promoter upstream sequences among different species revealed the conservation of binding sites for the androgen inducible NKX3.1 tumor suppressor. Defects of NKX3.1, such as, allelic loss, haploinsufficiency, attenuated expression or decreased protein stability represent established pathways in prostate tumorigenesis. We found that NKX3.1 directly binds to TMPRSS2 upstream sequences and negatively regulates the expression of the ERG protooncogene through the TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion.

More recently, its levels were found to be affected by androgen deprivation therapies and bisphosphonates. We investigated the role of P1NP as a surrogate marker of sub-radiological skeletal metastases in prostate cancer patients with biochemical failure (BF).  Methods:   BePrepared is a prospective longitudinal substudy of RADAR trial in which serial P1NPs were collected at regular intervals for 123 patients who had completed RADAR protocol treatment.  Results:   There was no trend identified in P1NP levels prior to diagnosis of BM. We found that there was no difference in P1NP concentrations at the time of diagnosis of BM in the group that developed BM compared with P1NP levels in groups with only nodal metastases or BF. In the group of patients who did not experience BF, P1NP was affected by previous luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone-agonist and bisphosphonate therapy. Hence, patients who received an 18-month course of androgen deprivation without bisphosphonates had significantly higher P1NP values than patients with shorter androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) course combined with a course of bisphosphonates.  Conclusion:   P1NP is not a sensitive serum marker of early BM in high-risk prostate cancer patients with BF and low prostate-specific antigen levels as its levels are affected by prior history of bone remodelling therapies such as ADT and bisphosphonates.""","""['Eka Moseshvili', 'David J Joseph', 'Nigel A Spry', 'Ronald J Cohen', 'Alberta Abreu', 'Allison Kautto', 'James W Denham']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Med Imaging Radiat Oncol""","""['Procollagen type 1 amino-terminal propeptide: a marker for bone metastases in prostate carcinoma.', 'Serum bone turnover markers (PINP and ICTP) for the early detection of bone metastases in patients with prostate cancer: a longitudinal approach.', 'Value of procollagen type 1 amino-terminal propeptide in patients with renal cell carcinoma.', 'Preserving bone health in patients with hormone-sensitive prostate cancer: the role of bisphosphonates.', 'Understanding treatments for bone loss and bone metastases in patients with prostate cancer: a practical review and guide for the clinician.']"""

The effects of low-dose ionizing radiation on plant growth have been studied extensively, yet few studies have investigated the effect of high-dose, hypofractionated radiotherapy on plant growth development.  Materials and methods:   A total of 150 plants from the genus Capsicum annuum were randomized to receive fractionated radiotherapy (5 doses of 10 Gy each), single high-dose (SHD) radiotherapy (single 50 Gy dose), or no radiotherapy (control group). Irradiation was delivered via linear accelerator and all samples were followed daily for 26 days to assess and compare daily growth.  Results:   On day 26, plants in the control, fractionated, and SHD groups had grown to a mean height of 7.55 cm, 4.32 cm, and 2.94 cm, respectively. These differences in overall growth were highly significant (P = 0.005). The SHD group showed the least amount of growth.  Conclusions:   SHD effectively stunts plant growth and development. Despite the evident differences between plant and animal cells, ionizing radiation is believed to work in a similar manner in all biological cells. These findings highlight the need to continue investigating the use of hypofractionated schemes in humans to improve cancer treatment outcomes.""","""['Marc Guedea', 'Antoni Castel', 'Marc Arnalte', 'Alex Mollera', 'Victor Muñoz', 'Ferran Guedea']""","""[]""","""2013""","""None""","""Rep Pract Oncol Radiother""","""['Ultra-hypofractionated versus conventionally fractionated radiotherapy for prostate cancer: 5-year outcomes of the HYPO-RT-PC randomised, non-inferiority, phase 3 trial.', 'External beam radiation dose escalation for high grade glioma.', 'Acute histopathological responses of testicular tissues after different fractionated abdominal irradiation in rats.', 'Hypofractionated Radiotherapy for Localized Prostate Cancer: A Challenging Accelerated Hypofractionated Radiotherapy.', 'Hypofractionated radiotherapy in non small cell lung cancer: a review of the current literature.']"""

Pin1 can co-operate with activated ErbB2 or Ras to enhance tumorigenesis. It does so by regulating the activity of proteins that are essential for gene expression and cell proliferation. Several targets of Pin1 such as c-Myc, the Androgen Receptor, Estrogen Receptor-alpha, Cyclin D1, Cyclin E, p53, RAF kinase and NCOA3 are deregulated in cancer. At the posttranscriptional level, emerging evidence indicates that Pin1 also regulates mRNA decay of histone mRNAs, GM-CSF, Pth, and TGFβ mRNAs by interacting with the histone mRNA specific protein SLBP, and the ARE-binding proteins AUF1 and KSRP, respectively. To understand how Pin1 may affect mRNA abundance on a genome-wide scale in mammalian cells, we used RNAi along with DNA microarrays to identify genes whose abundance is significantly altered in response to a Pin1 knockdown. Functional scoring of differentially expressed genes showed that Pin1 gene targets control cell adhesion, leukocyte migration, the phosphatidylinositol signaling system and DNA replication. Several mRNAs whose abundance was significantly altered by Pin1 knockdown contained AU-rich element (ARE) sequences in their 3' untranslated regions. We identified HuR and AUF1 as Pin1 interacting ARE-binding proteins in vivo. Pin1 was also found to stabilize all core histone mRNAs in this study, thereby validating our results from a previously published study. Statistical analysis suggests that Pin1 may target the decay of essential mRNAs that are inherently unstable and have short to medium half-lives. Thus, this study shows that an important biological role of Pin1 is to regulate mRNA abundance and stability by interacting with specific RNA-binding proteins that may play a role in cancer progression.""","""['Nithya Krishnan', 'Mark A Titus', 'Roopa Thapar']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['The prolyl isomerase Pin1 targets stem-loop binding protein (SLBP) to dissociate the SLBP-histone mRNA complex linking histone mRNA decay with SLBP ubiquitination.', 'The peptidyl-prolyl isomerase Pin1 regulates the stability of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor mRNA in activated eosinophils.', 'Pin1 regulates TGF-beta1 production by activated human and murine eosinophils and contributes to allergic lung fibrosis.', 'Regulation of AU-Rich Element RNA Binding Proteins by Phosphorylation and the Prolyl Isomerase Pin1.', 'Roles of Prolyl Isomerases in RNA-Mediated Gene Expression.', 'Transcriptome-Wide Association Analysis Identifies Novel Candidate Susceptibility Genes for Prostate-Specific Antigen Levels in Men Without Prostate Cancer.', 'The Role of KH-Type Splicing Regulatory Protein (KSRP) for Immune Functions and Tumorigenesis.', 'Pinning Down the Transcription: A Role for Peptidyl-Prolyl cis-trans Isomerase Pin1 in Gene Expression.', 'Nuclear Tau, p53 and Pin1 Regulate PARN-Mediated Deadenylation and Gene Expression.', 'Oncogenic Hijacking of the PIN1 Signaling Network.']"""

Other molecular mechanisms that regulate the Wnt signaling pathway in prostate cancer remain to be identified. Here, it is demonstrated that KIF3a, a subunit of kinesin-II motor protein, functions as an agonist of the Wnt signaling pathway in prostate cancer. KIF3a is upregulated in the majority of human prostate cancer cell lines and primary tumor biopsies. The expression levels of KIF3a correlate with a higher Gleason score, tumor-node-metastasis stage, and metastatic status of prostate cancer. Moreover, exogenous expression of KIF3a promoted cell growth in the benign prostate cells, whereas silencing KIF3a in cancer cells decreased cell proliferation, anchorage-independent cell growth, and cell migration/invasion. Mechanistically, KIF3a increases CK1-dependent DVL2 phosphorylation and β-catenin activation in prostate cancer cells, leading to transactivation of the Wnt-signaling target genes such as cyclin D1, HEF1, and MMP9.

However, the clinical significance and biological role of AKIP1 in cancer progression remain largely unknown. Herein, we report that AKIP1 is markedly overexpressed in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) cell lines and clinical ESCC samples. AKIP1 expression significantly correlates with ESCC progression and patients' shorter survival time. Furthermore, we find that overexpressing AKIP1 induces, whereas silencing AKIP1 reduces, ESCC angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, we demonstrate that AKIP1 transcriptionally upregulates vascular endothelial growth factor-C (VEGF-C) via interaction with its promoter through cooperation with multiple transcriptional factors, including SP1, AP2 and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB). Importantly, significant correlation between levels of AKIP1 and VEGF-C is observed in a cohort of human ESCC, as well as in non-small cell lung cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma and ovarian cancer. Hence, these findings indicate an important role for AKIP1 in ESCC angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis, and uncover a novel mechanism for the upregulation of VEGF-C in cancers.""","""['C Lin', 'L Song', 'A Liu', 'H Gong', 'X Lin', 'J Wu', 'M Li', 'J Li']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['Nkx2-8 downregulation promotes angiogenesis and activates NF-κB in esophageal cancer.', 'Increased expression of EIF5A2, via hypoxia or gene amplification, contributes to metastasis and angiogenesis of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.', 'AKIP1 promotes angiogenesis and tumor growth by upregulating CXC-chemokines in cervical cancer cells.', 'BRCA1-Associated Protein Increases Invasiveness of Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma.', 'WISP-1 promotes VEGF-C-dependent lymphangiogenesis by inhibiting miR-300 in human oral squamous cell carcinoma cells.', 'IL-1RA inhibits esophageal carcinogenesis and lymphangiogenesis via downregulating VEGF-C and MMP9.', 'The angiogenic genes predict prognosis and immune characteristics in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma: Evidence from multi-omics and experimental verification.', 'A-kinase interacting protein 1 regulates the cell proliferation, invasion, migration and angiogenesis of clear cell renal cell carcinoma cells and affects the ERK/c-Myc signaling pathway by binding to Rac1.', 'A-Kinase Interacting Protein 1 Knockdown Restores Chemosensitivity via Inactivating PI3K/AKT and β-Catenin Pathways in Anaplastic Thyroid Carcinoma.', 'Elevated AKIP1 expression is associated with tumor invasion, shorter survival time and decreased chemosensitivity in endometrial carcinoma.']"""

In the current study, we demonstrated that Src kinase itself phosphorylates δ-catenin on its tyrosine residues in prostate cancer cells and further illustrated that Y1073, Y1112 and Y1176 of δ-catenin are predominant sites responsible for tyrosine phosphorylation mediated by c-Src. Apart from c-Src, other Src family kinases, including Fgr, Fyn and Lyn, can also phosphorylate δ-catenin. We also found that c-Src-mediated Tyr-phosphorylation of δ-catenin increases its stability via decreasing its affinity to GSK3β and enhances its ability of inducing nuclear distribution of β-catenin through interrupting the integrity of the E-cadherin.

Objective:   To evaluate treatment with metformin in patients with castration-resistant PCa (CRPC) and the effect of the treatment on progression-free survival (PFS) and PSA doubling time (PSA DT).  Design, setting, and participants:   Forty-four men with progressive metastatic CRPC from 10 Swiss centers were included in this single-arm phase 2 trial between December 2010 and December 2011.  Intervention:   Patients received metformin 1000 mg twice daily until disease progression.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The primary end point was the absence of disease progression at 12 wk. Simon two-stage optimal design was applied. With a 5% significance level and 90% power, 44 patients were required to test PFS at 12 wk ≤ 15% (H0) compared with ≥ 35% (H1).  Results and limitations:   Thirty-six percent of patients were progression-free at 12 wk, 9.1% were progression-free at 24 wk, and in two patients a confirmed ≥ 50% prostate-specific antigen (PSA) decline was demonstrated. In 23 patients (52.3%) we observed a prolongation of PSA DT after starting metformin. The homeostatic model assessment index fell by 26% from baseline to 12 wk, indicating an improvement in insulin sensitivity. There was a significant change in insulin-like growth factor-1 and insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 from baseline to 12 wk. Sample size and lack of a control arm are the limitations of this trial; analyses are therefore exploratory.  Conclusions:   Treatment with metformin is safe in nondiabetic patients, and it yields objective PSA responses and may induce disease stabilization. The activity of metformin in PCa, along with its low cost, favorable toxicity profile, and positive effect on metabolic parameters, suggests that further investigation of metformin as therapy for patients with PCa is of interest.  Patient summary:   In this trial we assessed the use of the diabetes mellitus drug metformin in patients with advanced prostate cancer. We found disease stabilization and prolongation of prostate-specific antigen doubling time in some patients as well as effects on metabolic parameters.

Overall, 21 patients with prostate cancer were treated radically with 78Gy in 39 fractions had in total 418 CBCTs, each acquired at the end of the first 5 fractions and then every alternate fraction. The PRV was generated from the Boolean sum volume of the rectum obtained from first 5 fractions (PRV-CBCT-5) and from all CBCTs (PRV-CBCT-All). The PRV margin was compared at the superior, middle, and inferior slices of the contoured rectum to compare PRV-CBCT-5 and PRV-CBCT-All. We also compared the dose received by the planned rectum (Rectum-computed tomography [CT]), PRV-CBCT-5, PRV-CBCT-All, and average rectum (CBCT-AV-dose-volume histogram [DVH]) at critical dose levels. The average measured rectal volume for all 21 patients for Rectum-CT, PRV-CBCT-5, and PRV-CBCT-All was 44.3 ± 15.0, 92.8 ± 40.40, and 121.5 ± 36.7cm(3), respectively. For PRV-CBCT-All, the mean ± standard deviation displacement in the anterior, posterior, right, and left lateral directions in centimeters was 2.1 ± 1.1, 0.9 ± 0.5, 0.9 ± 0.8, and 1.1 ± 0.7 for the superior rectum; 0.8 ± 0.5, 1.1 ± 0.5, 1.0 ± 0.5, and 1.0 ± 0.5 for the middle rectum; and 0.3 ± 0.3; 0.9 ± 0.5; 0.4 ± 0.2, and 0.5 ± 0.3 for the inferior rectum, respectively. The first 5 CBCTs did not predict the PRV for individual patients. Our study shows that the PRV margin is different for superior, middle, and the inferior parts of the rectum, it is wider superiorly and narrower inferiorly.

In this study we addressed the potential of NAD(+) depletion as an anti-cancer strategy and assessed the combination with radiation.  Methods:   The anticipated radiosensitizing property of APO866 was investigated in prostate cancer cell lines PC3 and LNCaP in vitro and in PC3 xenografts in vivo.  Results:   We show that APO866 treatment leads to NAD(+) depletion. Combination experiments with radiation lead to a substantial decrease in clonogenic cell survival in PC3 and LNCaP cells. In PC3 xenografts, treatment with APO866 resulted in reduced intratumoral NAD(+) levels and induced significant tumor growth delay. Combined treatment of APO866 and fractionated radiation was more effective than the single modalities. Compared with untreated tumors, APO866 and radiation alone resulted in tumor growth delays of 14 days and 33 days, respectively, whereas the combination showed a significantly increased tumor growth delay of 65 days.

Objective:   We evaluated the rate and extension of PLND in patients who underwent robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP). We tested the adherence of the indication for PLND to the European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines.  Design, setting, and participants:   Our study was a multi-institutional retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data on 2985 consecutive patients who underwent RARP at five high-volume European institutions. Patients were stratified according to preoperative cancer risk group.  Intervention:   RARP.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The rate and extent of PLND across different institutions were analyzed. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression models evaluated the association between preoperative variables and the probability of receiving PLND, as well as the presence of lymph node invasion (LNI). Finally, the probability of LNI was calculated for each patient, and the indication for PLND was compared with the EAU guidelines' indications.  Results and limitations:   A lymph node dissection was performed in 1777 patients (59.7%; 34.5% of low-risk patients, 64.9% of intermediate-risk patients, and 91.2% of high-risk patients). These rates were different across institutions: 5.0-41.4% in low-risk patients (p<0.001), 31.3-81.4% in intermediate-risk patients (p<0.001), and 84.6-96.4% in high-risk patients (p=0.06). The mean and median number of nodes removed was 10.8, and 122 patients (4.1%) had nodal metastases. At multivariable analysis, the institution represented an independent predictor of PLND (p<0.001). Of patients with current indication for PLND (EAU guidelines), 77.8% actually received the procedure. Limitations were the retrospective study design with different pathologic assessment and lack of follow-up data.  Conclusions:   PLND is performed in a high proportion of patients undergoing RARP in high-volume centers in Europe for whom the procedure is indicated by the EAU guidelines, but significant differences exist among institutions. An effort toward a more rigorous standardization of PLND is advocated.  Patient summary:   In this paper, we investigated the indication for and extension of pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND) in different institutions in Europe.

Heat shock protein (Hsp) 90 inhibition is a rational therapeutic strategy for CRPC that targets key proteins such as androgen receptor (AR) and protein kinase B (Akt); however, most Hsp90 inhibitors trigger elevation of stress proteins like Hsp27 that confer tumor cell survival and treatment resistance.

Design, setting, and participants:   Inducible and constitutive Hsp27 and other HSPs were measured by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and immunoblot assays. The combinations of OGX-427 with Hsp90 inhibitors were evaluated in vitro for LNCaP cell growth and apoptosis and in vivo in CRPC LNCaP xenograft models.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Tumor volumes were compared using the Kruskal-Wallis test. Overall survival was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier curves, and statistical significance was assessed with the log-rank test.  Results and limitations:   Hsp90 inhibitors induced expression of HSPs in tumor cells and tissues in a dose- and time-dependent manner; in particular, Hsp27 mRNA and protein levels increased threefold. In vitro, OGX-427 synergistically enhanced Hsp90 inhibitor-induced suppression of cell growth and induced apoptosis by 60% as measured by increased sub-G1 fraction and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage. These biologic events were accompanied by decreased expression of HSPs, Akt, AR, and prostate-specific antigen, and induction of ER stress markers (cleaved activating transcription factor 6, glucose-regulated protein 78, and DNA-damage-inducible transcript 3). In vivo, OGX-427 potentiated the anticancer effects of Hsp90 inhibitor PF-04929113 (orally, 25mg/kg) to inhibit tumor growth and prolong survival in CRPC LNCaP xenografts.  Conclusions:   HSP90 inhibitor-mediated induction of Hsp27 expression can be attenuated by OGX-427, resulting in increased ER stress and apoptosis, and synergistic inhibition of CRPC tumor growth.  Patient summary:   This study supports the development of targeted strategies using OGX-427 in combination with Hsp90 inhibitors to improve patient outcome in CRPC.""","""['François Lamoureux', 'Christian Thomas', 'Min-Jean Yin', 'Ladan Fazli', 'Amina Zoubeidi', 'Martin E Gleave']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Corrigendum re: ""Suppression of Heat Shock Protein 27 Using OGX-427 Induces Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress and Potentiates Heat Shock Protein 90 Inhibitors to Delay Castrate-resistant Prostate Cancer"" Eur Urol 2014;66:145-55.', 'Clusterin inhibition using OGX-011 synergistically enhances Hsp90 inhibitor activity by suppressing the heat shock response in castrate-resistant prostate cancer.', 'A novel HSP90 inhibitor delays castrate-resistant prostate cancer without altering serum PSA levels and inhibits osteoclastogenesis.', 'Co-targeting AR and HSP90 suppresses prostate cancer cell growth and prevents resistance mechanisms.', 'Heat shock and other apoptosis-related proteins as therapeutic targets in prostate cancer.', 'HSP27, 70 and 90, anti-apoptotic proteins, in clinical cancer therapy (Review).', 'The endoplasmic reticulum stress response in prostate cancer.', 'Targeting Heat-Shock Protein 90 in Cancer: An Update on Combination Therapy.', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress of Gut Enterocyte and Intestinal Diseases.', 'HSP90-Specific nIR Probe Identifies Aggressive Prostate Cancers: Translation from Preclinical Models to a Human Phase I Study.', 'The role of heat shock proteins in neoplastic processes and the research on their importance in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer.']"""

The sequential activity of these agents has not been studied and treatment sequencing remains a key dilemma for clinicians.  Objective:   To describe the antitumour activity of cabazitaxel after docetaxel and next-generation endocrine agents.  Design, setting, and participants:   We report on a cohort of 59 men with progressing CRPC treated with cabazitaxel, 37 of whom had received prior abiraterone and 9 of whom had received prior enzalutamide.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Changes in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level were used to determine activity on abiraterone, enzalutamide, and cabazitaxel treatment. Radiologic tumour regressions according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) and symptomatic benefit were evaluated for cabazitaxel therapy.  Results and limitations:   The post-endocrine-therapy patients received abiraterone (n=32), sequential abiraterone and enzalutamide (n=5) or enzalutamide (n=4). These patients received a median of 7 mo of abiraterone and 11 mo of enzalutamide. A median of six cabazitaxel cycles (range: 1-10 cycles) were delivered, with ≥ 50% PSA declines in 16 of 41 (39%) patients, soft tissue radiologic responses in 3 of 22 (14%) evaluable patients, and symptomatic benefit in 9 of 37 evaluable patients (24%). Median overall survival and progression-free survival were 15.8 and 4.6 mo, respectively. Antitumor activity on cabazitaxel was less favourable in the abiraterone- and enzalutamide-naïve cohort (n=18), likely reflecting biologic differences in this cohort. These data were obtained from a retrospective analysis.  Conclusions:   This is the first report of cabazitaxel activity in CRPC progressing after treatment with docetaxel and abiraterone or enzalutamide. We demonstrate significant cabazitaxel activity in this setting.  Patient summary:   We looked at the antitumour activity of the chemotherapy drug cabazitaxel in men previously treated with docetaxel chemotherapy and the hormonal drugs abiraterone and enzalutamide. Cabazitaxel appeared active when given after abiraterone and enzalutamide.

We investigated the relationships between clinicopathologic variables across racial and socioeconomic lines following robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy.  Materials and methods:   We assessed treatment decisional regret using a validated questionnaire in a total of 484 white and 72 AA patients with PCa who were followed up for a median of 16.6 months post-robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy.

Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were used to evaluate the influence of race, aggregate SES, and other clinical and demographic characteristics on decisional regret.  Results:   The majority (87.7%) of the population was not regretful of their decision to undergo treatment. However, a greater proportion of AA vs. white patients were regretful (20.6% vs. 11.2%, respectively; P = 0.03). AA and white men were similar on all functional, clinical, and pathologic features with the exception of younger age among AA men (56 vs. 60 y, respectively; P<0.001). Although there were significant differences in SES by race (P<0.001), regret did not differ by SES (β =-1.53; P = 0.15).

The aim of our study was to re-assess the impact of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) on the utilization rate of PLND and its extent in the post-dissemination period.  Methods:   Relying on the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Medicare-linked database, 5804 patients with non-metastatic PCa undergoing open radical prostatectomy (ORP) or RARP between years 2008 and 2009 were identified. Uni- and multivariable logistic regression analyses tested the relationship between surgical approach (RARP vs. ORP) and: 1 - the rate of PLND (pNx vs. pN0-1); and 2 - the extent of PLND (limited vs. extended).  Results:   Overall, 3357 (57.8%) patients underwent a PLND. The proportion of patients treated with PLND was significantly higher among ORP vs. RARP patients: 71.2 vs. 48.6%, respectively (P < 0.001). In addition, the median number of lymph nodes removed was significantly higher for patients treated with ORP vs. RARP: 5 vs. 4, respectively (P < 0.001). In multivariable analyses, ORP was associated with 2.7- and 1.3-fold higher odds of undergoing PLND and of receiving an extended PLND compared to RARP, respectively (both P ≤ 0.001). Stratified analyses according to disease risk classifications revealed similar trends.

Methods and materials:   As part of a phase 2 study of hypofractionated radiation therapy (62 Gy in 20 fractions), the patients received a transperineal injection of 10 cc HA between the rectum and the prostate. A dosimetric computed tomographic (CT) scan was systematically performed before (CT1) and after (CT2) the injection. Two 9-beam intensity modulated radiation therapy-SBRT plans were optimized for the first 10 patients on both CTs according to 2 dosage levels: 5 × 6.5 Gy (PlanA) and 5 × 8.5 Gy (PlanB). Rectal wall parameters were compared with a dose-volume histogram, and the prostate-rectum separation was measured at 7 levels of the prostate on the center line of the organ.

Methods and materials:   A total of 268 patients who underwent intensity modulated radiation therapy to a prescribed dose of 86.4 Gy in 48 fractions during June 2004-December 2008 were evaluated with the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) questionnaire. Dose-volume histograms of the whole bladder, bladder wall, urethra, and bladder trigone were analyzed. The primary endpoint for GU toxicity was an IPSS sum increase ≥10 points over baseline. Univariate and multivariate analyses were done by the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazard models, respectively.  Results:   Median follow-up was 5 years (range, 3-7.7 years). Thirty-nine patients experienced an IPSS sum increase ≥10 during follow-up; 84% remained event free at 5 years. After univariate analysis, lower baseline IPSS sum (P=.006), the V90 of the trigone (P=.006), and the maximal dose to the trigone (P=.003) were significantly associated with an IPSS sum increase ≥10. After multivariate analysis, lower baseline IPSS sum (P=.009) and increased maximal dose to the trigone (P=.005) remained significantly associated. Seventy-two patients had both a lower baseline IPSS sum and a higher maximal dose to the trigone and were defined as high risk, and 68 patients had both a higher baseline IPSS sum and a lower maximal dose to the trigone and were defined as low risk for development of an IPSS sum increase ≥10. Twenty-one of 72 high-risk patients (29%) and 5 of 68 low-risk patients (7%) experienced an IPSS sum increase ≥10 (P=.001; odds ratio 5.19).

Results:   Guideline concordance was 79%-89% for patients with low- or intermediate-risk disease. Among high-risk patients, 66.6% of those aged 66-69 years received guideline-concordant management, compared with 51.9% of those aged 75-79 years. Discordance was mainly due to conservative management-no treatment or hormone therapy alone. Among the subgroup of patients aged ≤76 years with no measured comorbidity, findings were similar. On multivariable analysis, older age (75-79 vs 66-69 years, odds ratio 0.51, 95% confidence interval 0.50-0.57) was associated with a lower likelihood of guideline concordance for high-risk prostate cancer, but comorbidity was not.

Studies have identified multiple genetic risk loci for PCa incidence, but it is unknown whether they could be used as biomarkers for PCa-specific mortality (PCSM).  Objective:   To examine the association of 47 established PCa risk single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with PCSM.  Design, setting, and participants:   We included 10 487 men who had PCa and 11 024 controls, with a median follow-up of 8.3 yr, during which 1053 PCa deaths occurred.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The main outcome was PCSM. The risk allele was defined as the allele associated with an increased risk for PCa in the literature. We used Cox proportional hazards regression to calculate the hazard ratios of each SNP with time to progression to PCSM after diagnosis. We also used logistic regression to calculate odds ratios for each risk SNP, comparing fatal PCa cases to controls.  Results and limitations:   Among the cases, we found that 8 of the 47 SNPs were significantly associated (p<0.05) with time to PCSM. The risk allele of rs11672691 (intergenic) was associated with an increased risk for PCSM, while 7 SNPs had risk alleles inversely associated (rs13385191 [C2orf43], rs17021918 [PDLIM5], rs10486567 [JAZF1], rs6465657 [LMTK2], rs7127900 (intergenic), rs2735839 [KLK3], rs10993994 [MSMB], rs13385191 [C2orf43]). In the case-control analysis, 22 SNPs were associated (p<0.05) with the risk of fatal PCa, but most did not differentiate between fatal and nonfatal PCa. Rs11672691 and rs10993994 were associated with both fatal and nonfatal PCa, while rs6465657, rs7127900, rs2735839, and rs13385191 were associated with nonfatal PCa only.  Conclusions:   Eight established risk loci were associated with progression to PCSM after diagnosis. Twenty-two SNPs were associated with fatal PCa incidence, but most did not differentiate between fatal and nonfatal PCa. The relatively small magnitudes of the associations do not translate well into risk prediction, but these findings merit further follow-up, because they may yield important clues about the complex biology of fatal PCa.  Patient summary:   In this report, we assessed whether established PCa risk variants could predict PCSM. We found eight risk variants associated with PCSM: One predicted an increased risk of PCSM, while seven were associated with decreased risk. Larger studies that focus on fatal PCa are needed to identify more markers that could aid prediction.""","""['Irene M Shui', 'Sara Lindström', 'Adam S Kibel', 'Sonja I Berndt', 'Daniele Campa', 'Travis Gerke', 'Kathryn L Penney', 'Demetrius Albanes', 'Christine Berg', 'H Bas Bueno-de-Mesquita', 'Stephen Chanock', 'E David Crawford', 'W Ryan Diver', 'Susan M Gapstur', 'J Michael Gaziano', 'Graham G Giles', 'Brian Henderson', 'Robert Hoover', 'Mattias Johansson', 'Loic Le Marchand', 'Jing Ma', 'Carmen Navarro', 'Kim Overvad', 'Fredrick R Schumacher', 'Gianluca Severi', 'Afshan Siddiq', 'Meir Stampfer', 'Victoria L Stevens', 'Ruth C Travis', 'Dimitrios Trichopoulos', 'Paolo Vineis', 'Lorelei A Mucci', 'Meredith Yeager', 'Edward Giovannucci', 'Peter Kraft']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Genetic variants in predicting aggressive prostate cancer: ""ready for prime time?"".', 'Confirmation of genetic variants associated with lethal prostate cancer in a cohort of men from hereditary prostate cancer families.', 'Germline variants in IL4, MGMT and AKT1 are associated with prostate cancer-specific mortality: An analysis of 12,082 prostate cancer cases.', 'Circulating vitamin D, vitamin D-related genetic variation, and risk of fatal prostate cancer in the National Cancer Institute Breast and Prostate Cancer Cohort Consortium.', 'Association of gene polymorphisms of KLK3 and prostate cancer: A meta-analysis.', 'A meta-analysis of influence of MSMB promoter rs10993994 polymorphisms on prostate cancer risk.', 'Precision intervention for prostate cancer: Re-evaluating who is at risk.', 'Inherited risk assessment and its clinical utility for predicting prostate cancer from diagnostic prostate biopsies.', 'Long Non-Coding RNAs at the Chromosomal Risk Loci Identified by Prostate and Breast Cancer GWAS.', 'Associations between LncRNA MALAT1 Polymorphisms and Lymph Node Metastasis in Prostate Cancer.', 'Non-Coding Variants in Cancer: Mechanistic Insights and Clinical Potential for Personalized Medicine.']"""

In da Vinci robot-assisted prostatectomy (DVP), this approach is often avoided due to suspected difficulties in harvesting the prostate, loss in pneumoperitoneum, increased blood loss, and prolonged operating room (OR) time.  Objective:   To provide a detailed description of the technique, feasibility, and impact of the NeuroSAFE technique on OR time, blood loss, frequency of nerve sparing (NS), and positive surgical margins (PSMs) in DVP.  Design, setting, and participants:   We analyzed 1570 consecutive patients undergoing DVP from 2004 to 2012. NeuroSAFE was performed in 1178 patients.  Surgical procedure:   The prostate was intraoperatively harvested via an extension of the camera trocar incision without undocking the robotic arms. Blood spillage from the dorsal vein complex due to the loss of pneumoperitoneum was avoided by upward traction on the transurethral catheter. After prostate removal, pneumoperitoneum was reestablished by closing the extended incision with running sutures and repositioning the optical trocar. The NeuroSAFE procedure consisted of intraoperative bilateral frozen sections covering the entire neurovascular bundles adjacent prostate surface.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   We compared OR time, blood loss, NS frequency, and PSMs in non-NeuroSAFE versus NeuroSAFE DVP.  Results and limitations:   There was no significant difference in blood loss (253.5 ± 204.4 ml vs 265.8 ± 246.7 ml; p=0.49) and OR time (220 min ± 51 vs 224 min ± 64; p=0.22). No complications associated with specimen harvesting occurred. NS rate increased significantly with versus without NeuroSAFE (overall 97% vs 81%; pT2 99% vs 90%, pT3a 94% vs 74%, pT3b 91% vs 30). PSM rate dropped significantly with NeuroSAFE (overall 16% vs 24%; pT2 8% vs 15%, pT3a 22% vs 39%, pT3b 49% vs 67%; all p<0.05).  Conclusions:   We demonstrate a time-efficient and safe adaption of the NeuroSAFE technique to DVP.  Patient summary:   We describe a feasible and secure adaption of the neurovascular structure-adjacent frozen section examination (NeuroSAFE) procedure for da Vinci robot-assisted prostatectomy.

The impact of urinary incontinence on HRQoL was most pronounced 6 months after radiotherapy and gradually decreased over time. The impact of rectal discomfort on HRQoL was predominant at 6 months after radiotherapy, decreased at 12 months and increased again 2 years after radiotherapy. No significant impact on HRQoL was observed for any of the other toxicity endpoints, or non-toxicity related factors such as hormonal therapy, radiotherapy technique or age.

Methods and materials:   Clinical intensity modulated radiation therapy plans were created for 15 prostate cancer cases. To simulate a clinically relevant heterogeneous temperature distribution, hyperthermia treatment planning was performed for heating with the AMC-8 system. The temperature-dependent parameters α (Gy(-1)) and β (Gy(-2)) of the linear-quadratic model for prostate cancer were estimated from the literature. No thermal enhancement was assumed for normal tissue. The intensity modulated radiation therapy plans and temperature distributions were exported to our in-house-developed radiation therapy treatment planning system, APlan, and equivalent dose distributions without hyperthermia were calculated voxel by voxel using the linear-quadratic model.  Results:   The planned average tumor temperatures T90, T50, and T10 in the planning target volume were 40.5°C, 41.6°C, and 42.4°C, respectively. The planned minimum, mean, and maximum radiation therapy doses were 62.9 Gy, 76.0 Gy, and 81.0 Gy, respectively. Adding hyperthermia yielded an equivalent dose distribution with an extended 95% isodose level. The equivalent minimum, mean, and maximum doses reflecting the radiosensitization by hyperthermia were 70.3 Gy, 86.3 Gy, and 93.6 Gy, respectively, for a linear increase of α with temperature. This can be considered similar to a dose escalation with a substantial increase in tumor control probability for high-risk prostate carcinoma.

Methods and materials:   Clinical parameters of 61 prostate cancer patients, 34 with (overresponding, OR) and 27 without (non-responding, NR) severe late radiation toxicity were assembled. In addition, for a matched subset the DNA damage repair kinetics (γ-H2AX assay) and expression profiles of DNA repair genes were determined in ex vivo irradiated lymphocytes.  Results:   Examination of clinical data indicated none of the considered clinical parameters to be correlated with the susceptibility of patients to develop late radiation toxicity. Although frequencies of γ-H2AX foci induced immediately after irradiation were similar (P=.32), significantly higher numbers of γ-H2AX foci were found 24 hours after irradiation in OR compared with NR patients (P=.03). Patient-specific γ-H2AX foci decay ratios were significantly higher in NR patients than in OR patients (P<.0001). Consequently, NR patients seem to repair DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) more efficiently than OR patients. Moreover, gene expression analysis indicated several genes of the homologous recombination pathway to be stronger induced in NR compared with OR patients (P<.05). A similar trend was observed in genes of the nonhomologous end-joining repair pathway (P=.09). This is congruent with more proficient repair of DNA DSBs in patients without late radiation toxicity.  Conclusions:   Both gene expression profiling and DNA DSB repair kinetics data imply that less-efficient repair of radiation-induced DSBs may contribute to the development of late normal tissue damage. Induction levels of DSB repair genes (eg, RAD51) may potentially be used to assess the risk for late radiation toxicity.""","""['Bregje van Oorschot', 'Suzanne E Hovingh', 'Perry D Moerland', 'Jan Paul Medema', 'Lukas J A Stalpers', 'Harry Vrieling', 'Nicolaas A P Franken']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Radiotherapy: DNA repair--a marker of late toxicity.', 'Prostate Cancer Patients with Late Radiation Toxicity Exhibit Reduced Expression of Genes Involved in DNA Double-Strand Break Repair and Homologous Recombination.', 'DNA double-strand break repair and induction of apoptosis in ex vivo irradiated blood lymphocytes in relation to late normal tissue reactions following breast radiotherapy.', 'Predicting Radiosensitivity with Gamma-H2AX Foci Assay after Single High-Dose-Rate and Pulsed Dose-Rate Ionizing Irradiation.', 'The influence of heterochromatin on DNA double strand break repair: Getting the strong, silent type to relax.', 'Gamma histone 2AX (γ-H2AX)as a predictive tool in radiation oncology.', 'Assessment of Individual Radiosensitivity in Breast Cancer Patients Using a Combination of Biomolecular Markers.', 'Quantification of radiation-induced DNA double strand break repair foci to evaluate and predict biological responses to ionizing radiation.', ""Improving Patients' Life Quality after Radiotherapy Treatment by Predicting Late Toxicities."", 'A Comparison between Patient- and Physician-Reported Late Radiation Toxicity in Long-Term Prostate Cancer Survivors.', 'miR-29b-3p Increases Radiosensitivity in Stemness Cancer Cells via Modulating Oncogenes Axis.']"""

Methods:   A total of 1104 patients who had undergone trans-rectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided 12 + 1-core prostate biopsy were retrospectively evaluated in the first stage of the study. Age, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), the free/total PSA ratio (f/t), digital rectal examination (DRE) findings, the presence of a hypoechoic mass revealed using ultrasound, ultrasonic detection of microcalcifications, prostate volume (PV) and PSA density were considered as predictive factors. Multiple logistic regression analysis involving a backward elimination selection procedure was used to select independent predictors. We compared positive rates regarding 6-core and 12-core biopsy schemes at different risk levels. In the second stage of the study, 238 cases were evaluated using our nomogram. In higher risk patients, we employed a 6 + 1 core biopsy. Positive rates in the first and second stages of the study were compared.  Results:   Age, the baseline median natural logarithm of PSA (Ln[PSA]), Ln(PV), f/t, rate of abnormal DRE findings and rate of hypoechoic masses detected using TRUS were the factors that were finally submitted into our nomogram. A significantly greater area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve was obtained for the nomogram than for PSA level alone (0.853 vs. 0.761). A cancer probability cutoff value of 0.5 suggested no significant difference between the 6-core and 12-core biopsy schemes at higher risk levels. In the second stage of the study we verified that in patients with a cancer probability cutoff value >0.5, a 6 + 1-core biopsy could be used without a reduction in the positive detection rate, and significantly reducing the number of biopsy cores required.  Conclusions:   A nomogram based on data from Chinese males was developed to predict the positive detection rate, ratio of positive cores and Gleason score at each risk level. According to this nomogram, a reasonable biopsy strategy could be constituted to reduce the number of biopsy cores required in subjects at high risk.""","""['Yuan Huang', 'Gong Cheng', 'Bianjiang Liu', 'Pengfei Shao', 'Chao Qin', 'Jie Li', 'Lixin Hua', 'Changjun Yin']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""BMC Urol""","""['Developing a model for forecasting Gleason score ≥7 in potential prostate cancer patients to reduce unnecessary prostate biopsies.', 'The optimal number of initial prostate biopsy cores in daily practice: a prospective study using the Nara Urological Research and Treatment Group nomogram.', 'Prediction of the risk of harboring prostate cancer by a prebiopsy nomogram based on extended biopsy protocol.', 'A nomogram for prediction of prostate cancer on multi-core biopsy using age, serum prostate-specific antigen, prostate volume and digital rectal examination in Singapore.', 'Developing a follow-up strategy for patients with PSA ranging from 4 to 10 ng/ml via a new model to reduce unnecessary prostate biopsies.', 'Development and validation of a multi-parameter nomogram for predicting prostate cancer: a retrospective analysis from Handan Central Hospital in China.', 'MRI-Based Nomogram of Prostate Maximum Sectional Area and Its Zone Area for Prediction of Prostate Cancer.', 'Development and internal validation of a prediction model of prostate cancer on initial transperineal template-guided prostate biopsy.', 'Multivariable Models Incorporating Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging Efficiently Predict Results of Prostate Biopsy and Reduce Unnecessary Biopsy.', 'The prediction value of PI-RADS v2 score in high-grade Prostate Cancer: a multicenter retrospective study.']"""

This demands a precise target definition and knowledge on target location and extension during treatment. It is unclear how increase in fraction size affects changes in prostate volume during treatment. Our aim was to study prostate volume changes during extreme hypo-fractionation (7 × 6.1 Gy) by using sequential MRIs.  Methods:   Twenty patients treated with extreme hypo-fractionation were recruited from an on-going prospective randomized phase III trial. An MRI scan was done before start of treatment, at mid treatment and at the end of radiotherapy. The prostate was delineated at each MRI and the volume and maximum extension in left-right, anterior-posterior and cranial-caudal directions were measured.  Results:   There was a significant increase in mean prostate volume (14%) at mid treatment as compared to baseline. The prostate volume remained enlarged (9%) at the end of radiotherapy. Prostate swelling was most pronounced in the anterior-posterior and cranial-caudal directions.  Conclusions:   Extreme hypo-fractionation induced a significant prostate swelling during treatment that was still present at the time of last treatment fraction. Our results indicate that prostate swelling is an important factor to take into account when applying treatment margins during short extreme hypo-fractionation, and that tight margins should be applied with caution.""","""['Adalsteinn Gunnlaugsson', 'Elisabeth Kjellén', 'Oskar Hagberg', 'Camilla Thellenberg-Karlsson', 'Anders Widmark', 'Per Nilsson']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Radiat Oncol""","""['Evaluation of margins in pelvic lymph nodes and prostate radiotherapy and the impact of bladder and rectum on prostate position.', 'A randomized trial comparing hypofractionated and conventionally fractionated three-dimensional external-beam radiotherapy for localized prostate adenocarcinoma : a report on acute toxicity.', 'Changes in target volumes definition by using MRI for prostate bed radiotherapy planning--preliminary results.', 'Magnetic resonance imaging for delineation of prostate in radiotherapy: monocentric experience and review of literature.', 'IMRT for prostate cancer: defining target volume based on correlated pathologic volume of disease.', 'Practice-based training strategy for therapist-driven prostate MR-Linac adaptive radiotherapy.', 'Dosimetric Impact of Intrafraction Prostate Motion and Interfraction Anatomical Changes in Dose-Escalated Linac-Based SBRT.', 'Assessment of delivered dose in prostate cancer patients treated with ultra-hypofractionated radiotherapy on 1.5-Tesla MR-Linac.', 'Case Report: MR-Guided Adaptive Radiotherapy, Some Room to Maneuver.', 'Dosimetric comparison of MR-guided adaptive IMRT versus 3DOF-VMAT for prostate stereotactic radiotherapy.']"""

That suggests development of more flexible targeting platforms that incorporate multiple moieties enabling concurrent targeting to a variety of putative markers. We report the synthesis, biochemical, in vitro, and preliminary in vivo evaluation of a new heterobivalent (HtBv) imaging agent targeting both the prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) and integrin-αvβ3 surface markers, each of which can be overexpressed in certain tumor epithelium and/or neovasculature.

DOTA-conjugated HtBv probe 9 bound to PSMA or αvβ3 with affinities similar to those of monovalent (Mnv) compounds designed to bind to their targets independently. In situ energy minimization experiments support a model describing the conformations adapted by 9 that enable it to bind both targets. IRDye800-conjugated HtBv probe 10 demonstrated target-specific binding to either PSMA or integrin-αvβ3 overexpressing xenografts.

Biasing of conformational populations through substitution on the tetrahydroisoquinoline core at C1 and C3 has a profound effect on the antiproliferative activity against various cancer cell lines. The C3 methyl-substituted sulfamate (±)-7-methoxy-2-(3-methoxybenzyl)-3-methyl-6-sulfamoyloxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline (6 b), for example, was found to be ∼10-fold more potent than the corresponding non-methylated compound 7-methoxy-2-(3-methoxybenzyl)-6-sulfamoyloxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline (4 b) against DU-145 prostate cancer cells (GI50 values: 220 nM and 2.1 μM, respectively). Such compounds were also found to be active against a drug-resistant MCF breast cancer cell line. The position and nature of substitution of the N-benzyl group in the C3-substituted series was found to have a significant effect on activity. Whereas C1 methylation has little effect on activity, introduction of C1 phenyl and C3-gem-dimethyl substituents greatly decreases antiproliferative activity.

This hinders analysis of nativity-related cancer disparities. In the current study, the authors evaluated multiple imputation of nativity status among Hispanic patients diagnosed with cervical, prostate, and colorectal cancer and demonstrated the effect of multiple imputation on apparent nativity disparities in survival.  Methods:   Multiple imputation by logistic regression was used to generate nativity values (US-born vs foreign-born) using a priori-defined variables. The accuracy of the method was evaluated among a subset of cases. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to illustrate the effect of imputation by comparing survival among US-born and foreign-born Hispanics, with and without imputation of nativity.  Results:   Birthplace was missing for 31%, 49%, and 39%, respectively, of cases of cervical, prostate, and colorectal cancer. The sensitivity of the imputation strategy for detecting foreign-born status was ≥90% and the specificity was ≥86%. The agreement between the true and imputed values was ≥0.80 and the misclassification error was ≤10%. Kaplan-Meier survival curves indicated different associations between nativity and survival when nativity was imputed versus when cases with missing birthplace were omitted from the analysis.

The authors defined numeric cutpoints for fatigue severity based on functional interference and described the prevalence and characteristics of fatigue in patients with cancer and survivors.  Methods:   In a multicenter study, outpatients with breast, prostate, colorectal, or lung cancer rated their fatigue severity and symptom interference with functioning on the M. D. Anderson Symptom Inventory numeric scale of 0 to 10. Ratings of symptom interference guided the selection of numeric rating cutpoints between mild, moderate, and severe fatigue levels. Regression analysis identified significant factors related to reporting moderate=severe fatigue .  Results:   The statistically optimal cutpoints were 4 for moderate fatigue and 7 for severe fatigue. Moderate=severe fatigue was reported by 983 of 2177 patients (45%) undergoing active treatment and was more likely to occur in patients receiving treatment with strong opioids (odds ratio [OR], 3.00), those with a poor Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (OR, 2.00), those who had >5% weight loss within 6 months (OR, 1.60), those who were receiving >10 medications (OR, 1.58), those with lung cancer (OR, 1.55), and those with a history of depression (OR, 1.42). Among survivors (patients with complete remission or no evidence of disease, and not currently receiving cancer treatment), 29% of patients (150 of 515 patients) had moderate=severe fatigue that was associated with poor performance status (OR, 3.48) and a history of depression (OR, 2.21).

Methods:   Fluorescence in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry were utilized to detect ERG rearrangement and SOX4 expression. Cellular function was evaluated by transwell, wound healing assays, and cell adhesion assay, respectively. Interaction between ERG and SOX4 was arrayed by co-immunoprecipitation, Real-time PCR, Western blot, and siRNA. Direct binding of ERG to the promoter of SOX4, as well as epigenetic modifications of their promoters after TGF-β1 treatment was monitored by chromatin immunoprecipitation.  Results:   ERG regulated SOX4 expression via binding to its promoter. Silencing both of them showed duplicate effects on restoring the epithelial characteristics, increasing cellular adhesion and decreasing capacity of cellular migration and invasion. ERG and SOX4 have cooperative roles in TGF-β1-induced epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) process. In addition, TGF-β1 stimulation increased levels of chromatin marks associated with active genes (H3K4me3, H416ac), and decreased levels of repressive marks (H3K27me3) at their promoters. 5-aza and TSA treatment changed expressions of ERG and SOX4.

Methods:   HETEs were determined using ultrahigh pressure liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS).

The goal of the present study was to evaluate the prognostic value of VEGF single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and haplotypes for clinical recurrence after definitive radiotherapy for prostate cancer.  Patients and methods:   The association of seven VEGF-A polymorphisms and their haplotypes with clinical recurrence (defined as the occurrence of local recurrence and/or distant metastases) in 496 prostate cancer patients treated with definitive radiotherapy were investigated. Genotypes were determined by 5'-nuclease (TaqMan) assays; haplotypes were analyzed using the Haploview program.  Results:   Within a median follow-up time of 80 months, 44 patients (9 %) developed clinical recurrences. Haplotype analysis showed two separate blocks of high-linkage disequilibrium, formed by five polymorphisms (- 2578C > A, - 2489C > T, - 1498C > T, - 634G > C, - 7C > T) upstream of the coding sequence (CCCCC, ATTGC, CCCGC, ATTGT) and two polymorphisms (936C > T, 1612G > A) downstream of the coding sequence (CA, CG, TG). Carriers of at least 1 copy of the ATTGC haplotype were at higher risk of recurrence (hazard ratio [HR] 3.83; 95 %CI 1.48-9.90, p = 0.006); for carriers of 2 copies, the HR was 4.85 (95 %CI 1.72-13.6; p = 0.003). In multivariate analysis, patients harboring at least one copy of the ATTGC haplotype remained at increased risk of recurrence (HR 3.63, 95 %CI 1.38-9.55, p = 0.009); in patients carrying 2 copies, the HR was 4.72 (95 %CI 1.64-13.6, p = 0.004).

Unfortunately, many cell line studies have only involved single cell lines, partially characterized cell lines or were performed without controls, and this may have been detrimental to effective biomarker discovery. We have analyzed a panel of prostate cancer and nonmalignant control cell lines using current biomarkers and then investigated a set of prospective endosomal and lysosomal proteins to search for new biomarkers.  Methods:   Western blotting was used to define the amount of protein and specific molecular forms in cell extracts and culture media from a panel of nonmalignant (RWPE-1, PNT1a, PNT2) and prostate cancer (22RV1, CaHPV10, DU-145, LNCaP) cell lines. Gene expression was determined by qRT-PCR.  Results:   HPV-18 transfected cell lines displayed a different pattern of protein and gene expression when compared to the other cell lines examined, suggesting that these cell lines may not be the most optimal for prostate cancer biomarker discovery. There was an increased amount of prostatic acid phosphatase and kallikrein proteins in LNCaP cell extracts and culture media, but variable amounts of these proteins in other prostate cancer cell lines. There were minimal differences in the amounts of lysosomal proteins detected in prostate cancer cells and culture media, but two endosomal proteins, cathepsin B and acid ceramidase, had increased gene and protein expression, and certain molecular forms showed increased secretion from prostate cancer cells (P ≤ 0.05). LIMP-2 gene and protein expression was significantly increased in prostate cancer compared to nonmalignant cell lines (P ≤ 0.05).  Conclusions:   While the existing prostate cancer biomarkers and lysosomal proteins investigated here were not able to specifically differentiate between a panel of nonmalignant and prostate cancer cell lines, endosomal proteins showed some discriminatory capacity. LIMP-2 is a critical regulator of endosome biogenesis and the increased expression observed in prostate cancer cells indicated that other endosome related proteins may also be upregulated and could be investigated as novel biomarkers.""","""['Ian R Johnson', 'Emma J Parkinson-Lawrence', 'Lisa M Butler', 'Doug A Brooks']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Suppression of LNCaP prostate cancer xenograft tumors by a prostate-specific protein tyrosine phosphatase, prostatic acid phosphatase.', 'Integrative analysis of N-linked human glycoproteomic data sets reveals PTPRF ectodomain as a novel plasma biomarker candidate for prostate cancer.', 'MicroRNAs and zinc metabolism-related gene expression in prostate cancer cell lines treated with zinc(II) ions.', 'The role of tissue microarrays in prostate cancer biomarker discovery.', 'Immortalized and tumorigenic adult human prostatic epithelial cell lines: characteristics and applications.

However, a detailed underlying mechanism by which EGF induces EMT and prostate cancer cell progression remained to be answered. Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α and TWIST1 are transcription factors implicated in EMT and cancer metastasis. The purpose of this study is to determine the underlying mechanism of EGF-induced TWIST1 expression and prostate cancer invasion.  Methods:   siRNAs were used to silence genes. Immunoblotting, quantitative RT-PCR and immunofluorescence analysis were used to examine protein or mRNA expression. Modified Boyden chamber and invasion assay kit with Matrigel-coated inserts were used to determine prostate cancer cell migration and invasion, respectively.  Results:   We observed that EGF induced HIF-1α expression and morphological change of prostate cancer epithelial cells to mesenchymal cells. Silencing HIF-1α expression dramatically reduced EGF-induced TWIST1 expression and prostate cancer cell EMT. Conversely, transfection of the cells with HIF-1α siRNA reversed the reduced E-cadherin expression by EGF. Pretreatment of the cells with pharmacological inhibitors of reactive oxygen species [ROS, N-acetylcysteine (NAC)] and STAT3 (WP1066) but not p38 MAPK (SB203580) significantly reduced EGF-induced HIF-1α mRNA and protein expression. Further, pretreatment of the cells with NAC attenuated EGF-induced STAT3 phosphorylation. In addition, we showed that TWIST1 mediated EGF-induced N-cadherin expression, leading to prostate cancer invasion.

However, the process of in vivo passage itself may result in gene expression changes that could confound the analysis of such resistant cell variants compared to their parental cell lines.  Methods:   We compared the expression profiles of parental PC-3 human prostate cancer cells and PC-3 cells re-derived after in vivo passage in athymic nude mice. Whole transcriptome information was obtained using the SOLiD 4 system (Applied Biosystems). Differentially expressed genes were mapped to genes in the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery for gene enrichment and functional annotation analysis. The expression of a panel of these genes was validated using quantitative RT-PCR.  Results:   Altogether, 21,032 distinct transcripts were found in PC-3 and/or NS1.1. Of these, 906 were differentially regulated (≥2-fold) in NS1.1 versus PC-3. 337 transcripts were upregulated, and 569 were downregulated, including genes previously associated with various aspects of prostate carcinogenesis such as TLR4 and IGFBP5, respectively. Gene ontology analysis of the differentially expressed transcripts revealed enrichment for biological processes such as cell adhesion, migration, and angiogenesis.

It uses multiple radiation beams targeted to the tumor, however, large volumes of the body receive low doses of irradiation. Using γ-H2AX and global genome expression analysis, we studied the biological responses induced by low doses of ionizing radiation in prostate cancer patients following IMRT. By means of different bioinformatics analyses, we report that IMRT induced an inflammatory response via the induction of viral, adaptive, and innate immune signaling. In response to growth factors and immune-stimulatory signaling, positive regulation in the progression of cell cycle and DNA replication were induced. This denotes pro-inflammatory and pro-survival responses. Furthermore, double strand DNA breaks were induced in every patient 30 min after the treatment and remaining DNA repair and damage signaling continued after 18-24 h. Nine genes belonging to inflammatory responses (TLR3, SH2D1A and IL18), cell cycle progression (ORC4, SMC2 and CCDC99) and DNA damage and repair (RAD17, SMC6 and MRE11A) were confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR.

There is limited information available on Medicare costs associated with treating SREs. The objective of this study was to ascertain SRE-related costs among older men with metastatic prostate cancer in the US.  Methods:   We analysed patients aged 66 years or older who were diagnosed with incident stage IV (M1) prostate cancer between 2000 and 2007 from the linked Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER)-Medicare dataset. A propensity score for the incidence of an SRE was estimated using a logistic regression model including demographic and clinical baseline variables. Patients with SREs (cases) were matched to patients without SREs (controls) based on the propensity score, length of follow-up (i.e. date of prostate cancer diagnosis to last date of observation) and death. Health resource utilization cost differences between cases and controls over time were compared using generalized linear models. Healthcare costs were examined by type of SRE (pathological fracture only, pathological fracture with concurrent surgery, spinal cord compression only, spinal cord compression with concurrent surgery, and bone surgery only) and by source of care (inpatient, physician/non-institutional provider, skilled nursing facility, outpatient and hospice). All costs were adjusted to 2009 US dollars, using the medical care component of the Consumer Price Index.  Results:   Application of the inclusion criteria resulted in 1,131 metastatic prostate cancer patients with SREs and 6,067 patients without SREs during follow-up. The average age of the sample was 79 years, and 14 % were African American. A total of 928 patients with SREs were matched to 928 patients without SREs. The average health care utilization cost of patients with SREs was US$29,696 (95 % confidence interval [CI] US$24,730-US$34,662) higher than that of the controls. The most expensive SRE group was spinal cord compression with concurrent surgery (US$82,868: 95 % CI US$67,472-US$98,264) followed by bone surgery only (US$37,496: 95 % CI US$29,684-US$45,308), pathological fracture with concurrent surgery (US$34,169: 95 % CI US$25,837-US$ 42,501), spinal cord compression only (US$25,793: 95 % CI US$20,933-US$30,653) and pathological fracture only (US$14,649: 95 % CI US$6,537-US$22,761). The largest cost difference by source of care was observed for hospitalizations (p < 0.01).  Conclusion:   Metastatic prostate cancer patients with SREs incur higher costs compared to similar patients without SREs.

In addition to its normal spectrum of metabolic effects, insulin can act as a growth factor and has the ability to promote mitogenic activity. Thus, hyperinsulinemia is regarded as a potentially important cancer risk factor among diabetic patients. However, the mechanisms of action of insulin in the specific context of prostate cancer (PCa) and, in particular, the specific receptor that mediates its actions have not been elucidated yet. The aims of this study were to investigate whether insulin can directly induce mitogenic activities in PCa-derived cell lines and to examine the mechanisms responsible for these actions. To this end, we used several PCa-derived cell lines, representing early and advanced stages of the disease. Our results indicated that insulin induces cell proliferation in a dose-dependent fashion in the LNCaP, C4-2, and P69 cell lines. We also demonstrated that insulin enabled LNCaP and C4-2 cells to progress through the cell cycle. Immunoprecipitation assays revealed that insulin activated the insulin receptor (INSR), but not the IGF1 receptor (IGF1R). In addition, INSR was able to compensate for and mediate IGF1 mitogenic signals following IGF1R inhibition. In conclusion, insulin exhibits direct mitogenic activities in PCa cells, which are mediated exclusively through the INSR.

Piperlongumine (PL), a natural alkaloid present in the fruit of the Long pepper, is known to exhibit notable anticancer effects. Here we investigate the impact of PL on Akt/mTOR signalling.  Methods:   We examined Akt/mTOR signalling in cancer cells of various origins including prostate, kidney and breast after PL treatment. Furthermore, cell viability after concomitant treatment with PL and the autophagy inhibitor, Chloroquine (CQ) was assessed. We then examined the efficacy of in vivo combination treatment using a mouse xenograft tumour model.  Results:   We demonstrate for the first time that PL effectively inhibits phosphorylation of Akt target proteins in all tested cells. Furthermore, the downregulation of Akt downstream signalling resulted in decrease of mTORC1 activity and autophagy stimulation. Using the autophagy inhibitor, CQ, the level of PL-induced cellular death was significantly increased. Moreover, concomitant treatment with PL and CQ demonstrated notable antitumour effect in a xenograft mouse model.

These formulations minimize systemic exposure; however, unfortunately, therapeutic efficacy has remained limited due to the slow diffusion of liposomal particles within the tumor and limited release or uptake of the encapsulated drug. Here, the carboxyl-terminated CRPPR peptide, with affinity for the receptor neuropilin-1 (NRP), which is expressed on both endothelial and cancer cells, was conjugated to liposomes to enhance the tumor accumulation. Using a pH sensitive probe, liposomes were optimized for specific NRP binding and subsequent cellular internalization using in vitro cellular assays. Liposomes conjugated with the carboxyl-terminated CRPPR peptide (termed C-LPP liposomes) bound to the NRP-positive primary prostatic carcinoma cell line (PPC-1) but did not bind to the NRP-negative PC-3 cell line, and binding was observed with liposomal peptide concentrations as low as 0.16mol%. Binding of the C-LPP liposomes was receptor-limited, with saturation observed at high liposome concentrations. The identical peptide sequence bearing an amide terminus did not bind specifically, accumulating only with a high (2.5mol%) peptide concentration and adhering equally to NRP positive and negative cell lines. The binding of C-LPP liposomes conjugated with 0.63mol% of the peptide was 83-fold greater than liposomes conjugated with the amide version of the peptide. Cellular internalization was also enhanced with C-LPP liposomes, with 80% internalized following 3h incubation. Additionally, fluorescence in the blood pool (~40% of the injected dose) was similar for liposomes conjugated with 0.63mol% of carboxyl-terminated peptide and non-targeted liposomes at 24h after injection, indicating stable circulation. Prior to doxorubicin treatment, in vivo tumor accumulation and vascular targeting were increased for peptide-conjugated liposomes compared to non-targeted liposomes based on confocal imaging of a fluorescent cargo, and the availability of the vascular receptor was confirmed with ultrasound molecular imaging. Finally, over a 4-week course of therapy, tumor knockdown resulting from doxorubicin-loaded, C-LPP liposomes was similar to non-targeted liposomes in syngeneic tumor-bearing FVB mice and C-LPP liposomes reduced doxorubicin accumulation in the skin and heart and eliminated skin toxicity. Taken together, our results demonstrate that a carboxyl-terminated RXXR peptide sequence, conjugated to liposomes at a concentration of 0.63mol%, retains long circulation but enhances binding and internalization, and reduces toxicity.""","""['Eric E Paoli', 'Elizabeth S Ingham', 'Hua Zhang', 'Lisa M Mahakian', 'Brett Z Fite', 'M Karen Gagnon', 'Sarah Tam', 'Azadeh Kheirolomoom', 'Robert D Cardiff', 'Katherine W Ferrara']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Control Release""","""['Targeted vs. non-targeted delivery systems: reduced toxicity over efficacy.', ""Combined delivery and magnetic resonance imaging of neural cell adhesion molecule-targeted doxorubicin-containing liposomes in experimentally induced Kaposi's sarcoma."", 'Sonosensitive theranostic liposomes for preclinical in vivo MRI-guided visualization of doxorubicin release stimulated by pulsed low intensity non-focused ultrasound.', 'Temperature-sensitive liposomes for doxorubicin delivery under MRI guidance.', 'Polyethylene glycol-coated (pegylated) liposomal doxorubicin.

Methods:   This was a retrospective, single-institution study of 115 prostatectomy patients with suspected tumor recurrence who underwent both (11)C-choline PET/CT and multiparametric MR imaging with endorectal coil. The reference standard included histopathology, treatment change, and imaging follow-up for determination of locally recurrent tumor, lymph node (LN) metastases, and skeletal metastases. Two nuclear medicine and 2 genitourinary radiologists independently and in a masked manner reviewed PET/CT and multiparametric MR imaging, respectively. The reviewers assessed for local recurrence in the prostatectomy bed as well as LN and bone metastases, rating their diagnostic confidence with a 5-point scoring system for each location. Receiver-operating-characteristic analysis was used to compare the 2 modalities.  Results:   The standard of reference (either positive or negative) for the diagnosis of local recurrence and pelvic LN and bone metastases was met in 87, 70, and 95 patients, respectively. Documented local recurrence and pelvic LN and bone metastases was present in 61 of 87 (70.1%), 50 of 70 (71.4%), and 16 of 95 (16.8%) patients, respectively. Patient-based area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curves of multiparametric MR imaging versus PET/CT for the diagnosis of local recurrence and pelvic LN and bone metastases were 0.909 versus 0.761 (P = 0.0079), 0.812 versus 0.952 (P = 0.0064), and 0.927 versus 0.898 (P = 0.69), respectively. Among 61 patients with local recurrence, 32 patients (52.4%) were correctly diagnosed as having local recurrence by both multiparametric MR imaging and PET/CT, 22 (36.1%) were correctly diagnosed by multiparametric MR imaging only, 6 (9.8%) could not be diagnosed by either modality, and 1 (1.6%) was correctly diagnosed by PET/CT only. The patient-based sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of multiparametric MR imaging for diagnosing local recurrence were 88.5% (54/61), 84.6% (22/26), and 87.4% (76/87) whereas those of PET/CT for detecting body LN or bone metastases were 92.3% (72/78), 100% (18/18), and 93.8% (90/96), respectively.  Conclusion:   Multiparametric MR imaging with endorectal coil is superior for the detection of local recurrence, PET/CT is superior for pelvic LN metastasis, and both were equally excellent for pelvic bone metastasis.

In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of NKX3.1 in DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair. We demonstrate that the DNA damage induced by CPT-11 (irinotecan, a topo I inhibitor), doxorubicin (a topo II inhibitor), and H2O2 (a mediator of oxidative damage), but not by etoposide (another topo II inhibitor), is negatively influenced by NKX3.1 expression. We also examined γH2AX((S139)) foci formation and observed that the overexpression of NKX3.1 resulted a remarkable decrease in the formation of γH2AX((S139)) foci. Intriguingly, we observed in NKX3.1 silencing studies that the depletion of NKX3.1 correlated with a significant decrease in the levels of p-ATM((S1981)) and γH2AX((S139)). The data imply that the DNA damage response (DDR) can be altered, perhaps via a decrease in the topoisomerase I re-ligation function; this is consistent with the physical association of NKX3.1 with DDR mediators upon treatment of both PC-3 and LNCaP cells with CPT-11. Furthermore, the depletion of NKX3.1 resulted in a G1/S progression via the facilitation of an increase in E2F stabilization concurrent with the suppressed DDR. Thus, the topoisomerase I inhibitor-mediated DNA damage enhanced the physical association of NKX3.1 with γH2AX((S139)) on the chromatin in LNCaP cells, whereas NKX3.1 in the soluble fraction was associated with p-ATM((S1981)) and RAD50 in these cells. Overall, the data suggest that androgens and NKX3.1 expression regulate the progression of the cell cycle and concurrently activate the DDR. Therefore, androgen withdrawal may augment the development of an error-prone phenotype and, subsequently, the loss of DNA damage control during prostate cancer progression.""","""['Burcu Erbaykent-Tepedelen', 'Selda Karamil', 'Ceren Gonen-Korkmaz', 'Kemal S Korkmaz']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Steroid Biochem Mol Biol""","""['Targeting DNA Damage Response in Prostate and Breast Cancer.', 'NKX3.1 contributes to S phase entry and regulates DNA damage response (DDR) in prostate cancer cell lines.', 'NKX3.1 activates cellular response to DNA damage.', 'Rac1 protein signaling is required for DNA damage response stimulated by topoisomerase II poisons.', 'Cytometry of ATM activation and histone H2AX phosphorylation to estimate extent of DNA damage induced by exogenous agents.', 'Reciprocal deregulation of NKX3.1 and AURKA axis in castration-resistant prostate cancer and NEPC models.', 'LIMK2-NKX3.1 Engagement Promotes Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Targeting DNA Damage Response in Prostate and Breast Cancer.', 'CRISPR/Cas9-Mediated Point Mutation in Nkx3.1 Prolongs Protein Half-Life and Reverses Effects Nkx3.1 Allelic Loss.', 'Homeodomain Proteins Directly Regulate ATM Kinase Activity.']"""

Since T plays an important role in androgen-sensitive diseases, this enzyme is thus an interesting therapeutic target. In an attempt to design compounds to lower the level of T, we synthesized androsterone derivatives substituted at position 3 as inhibitors of 17β-HSD3, and selected one of the most potent compounds for additional studies. In an enzymatic assay in homogenized and whole HEK-293 cells overexpressing 17β-HSD3, the inhibitor RM-532-105 efficiently inhibited the conversion of natural substrate 4-dione (50nM) into T with an IC50 of 26nM and 5nM, respectively.

We compared treatment plans developed with 2 different Elekta multileaf collimators (MLC): Beam Modulator micro-MLC (mMLC) (4-mm leaf width at the isocenter) and standard MLC (10-mm leaf width at the isocenter). The comparison was performed for 15 patients with localized prostate cancer in 3DCRT and IMRT delivery; a total of 60 treatment plans were processed. The dose-volume histograms were used to provide the quantitative comparison between plans. In particular, we analyzed differences between rectum and bladder sparing in terms of a set of appropriate Vx (percentage of organ at risk [OAR] volume receiving the x dose) and differences between target conformity and coverage in terms of coverage factor and conformation number. Our analysis demonstrates that in 3DCRT there is an advantage in the use of Elekta Beam Modulator mMLC in terms of organ sparing; in particular, a significant decrease in rectal V60 and V50 (p = 0.001) and in bladder V70 and V65 (p = 0.007 and 0.002, respectively) was found. Moreover, a better target dose conformity was obtained (p = 0.002). IMRT plans comparison demonstrated no significant differences between the use of the 4 or 10-mm MLCs.

In the cell, arginine is converted to nitric oxide (NO). We have reported that up-regulation of CPD mRNA/protein levels by 17β-estradiol and prolactin (PRL) in breast cancer cells, and by testosterone in prostate cancer cells, increased NO production and cell survival. The CPD promoter contains a consensus γ-interferon-activated sequence (GAS) and 3 putative androgen response elements (ARE.1, ARE.2, ARE.3) that could potentially bind PRL-activated transcription factor Stat5 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 5) and the liganded androgen receptor (AR), respectively. This study showed that synthetic androgen R1881 and PRL elevated CPD mRNA/protein levels in human MCF-7 and T47D breast cancer cells in a time-/dose-dependent manner. PRL/R1881-elevated CPD expression was blocked by actinomycin-D, and a CPD promoter construct containing these GAS and AREs was stimulated by PRL or R1881, indicating transcriptional regulation by both hormones. Luciferase reporter assays showed that GAS and the adjacent ARE.1 only were active. Mutation of GAS in the ΔGAS-CPD construct (ARE.1 intact) abolished CPD promoter activity in response to PRL and, surprisingly, to R1881 as well. ΔGAS-CPD promoter activity was restored by PRL+R1881 in combination, and enhanced by ectopic Stat5, but abolished by Stat5 gene knockdown. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis confirmed binding of activated Stat5 and liganded AR to GAS and ARE.1, respectively. Activated Stat5 also induced binding of unliganded AR to ARE.1, and liganded AR induced binding of unactivated Stat5 to GAS. In summary, PRL and R1881, acting through Stat5 and AR, act cooperatively to stimulate CPD gene transcription in breast cancer cells.""","""['Samir Koirala', 'Lynn N Thomas', 'Catherine K L Too']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Mol Endocrinol""","""['Prolactin and androgen R1881 induce pro-survival carboxypeptidase-D and EDD E3 ligase in triple-negative and HER2+ breast cancer.', 'Synergistic action of prolactin (PRL) and androgen on PRL-inducible protein gene expression in human breast cancer cells: a unique model for functional cooperation between signal transducer and activator of transcription-5 and androgen receptor.', 'Prolactin- and testosterone-induced carboxypeptidase-D correlates with increased nitrotyrosines and Ki67 in prostate cancer.', 'Prolactin/androgen-inducible carboxypeptidase-D increases with nitrotyrosine and Ki67 for breast cancer progression in vivo, and upregulates progression markers VEGF-C and Runx2 in vitro.', 'Prolactin-induced prostate tumorigenesis.', 'The Relevant Participation of Prolactin in the Genesis and Progression of Gynecological Cancers.', 'Prolactin and androgen R1881 induce pro-survival carboxypeptidase-D and EDD E3 ligase in triple-negative and HER2+ breast cancer.', 'Prolactin-inducible EDD E3 ubiquitin ligase promotes TORC1 signalling, anti-apoptotic protein expression, and drug resistance in breast cancer cells.']"""

Results:   HIV followed by alcoholism and mental disorders among 18-45-years old, and heart failure, diabetes, IHD and cancer among those ≥ 65 years old were associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality. Many conditions were associated with increased risk for all-cause hospitalizations, but the increased risk was consistent across all ages for mental disorders.

Orally fed GE showed 2.4-fold higher tumor growth-inhibitory efficacy than Mix in human prostate tumor xenografts. Pharmacokinetic evaluations and bioavailability measurements addressed the efficacy differences between GE and Mix. Plasma concentration-time profiles revealed multiple peaking phenomenon for ginger constituents when they were fed as GE as opposed to Mix, indicating enterohepatic recirculation.

The FASN level in colorectal cancer patients' serum is significantly higher than that in healthy persons' serum. FASN levels in the serum of colorectal cancer patients are associated with tumor extent, lymph node metabasis status, distant metastasis, and tumor clinical stage. The 5-year overall survival rate and 5-year disease-free survival rate among patients with low FASN levels in serum are significantly higher than those among patients with high FASN levels in serum (log-rank P = 0.003).

We investigated predictors of MESCC, its treatment, and its impact on hospital length of stay for patients with advanced prostate cancer.  Methods:   We used the SEER-Medicare database to identify patients >65 years with stage IV (n = 14,800) prostate cancer. We used polytomous logistic regression to compare those with and without MESCC and those hospitalized for treatment with surgical decompression and/or RT.  Results:   MESCC developed in 711 (5 %) of patients, among whom 359 (50 %) received RT and 107 (15 %) underwent surgery ± RT. Median survival was 10 months. MESCC was more likely among patients who were black (OR 1.75, 95 %CI 1.39-2.19 vs. white) and had high-grade tumors (OR 3.01, 95 %CI 1.14-7.94), and less likely in those younger; with prior hormonal therapy (OR 0.73, 95 %CI 0.62-0.86); or with osteoporosis (OR 0.63, 95 %CI 0.47-0.83). Older patients were less likely to undergo either RT or surgery, as were those with ≥1 comorbidity. Patients with high-grade tumors were more likely to undergo RT (OR 1.92, 95 %CI 1.25-2.96). Those who underwent RT or surgery spent an additional 11 and 29 days, respectively, hospitalized.  Conclusions:   We found that black men with metastatic prostate cancer are more likely to develop MESCC than whites.

This study examined the VD margins in radical prostatectomy patients to report the incidence of PSM and their clinical staging.  Methods and results:   A total of 2701 consecutive specimens (1995-2009) were reviewed for tumour infiltration of the VD margin and correlated with clinicopathological data. Forty-one of 2701 cases (1.5%) had a positive VD margin. Thirteen cases had bilateral infiltration. All tumours were locally advanced [pT3a (n = 1), pT3b (n = 34), pT4 (n = 6)]; 15 (37%) had lymph node metastases. While Gleason scores ranged from 7 to 9, mean PSA was 22.3 ng/ml (1.68-127 ng/ml). In all cases with seminal vesicle infiltration (40 of 41) the PSM of the VD was seen ipsilaterally. In 11 of 15 patients (73%) with pN1 status, seminal vesicle infiltration and PSM of the VD were seen on the same side. In 16 cases (39%) the VD was the only PSM.  Conclusions:   A PSM of the VD is an infrequent finding, but might appear as the only PSM. Histological evaluation of the VD therefore seems reasonable, especially as biochemical recurrence has been reported with positive VD margins, and awareness of them might assist in making clinical decisions for adjuvant therapy.""","""['Matthias Saar', 'Jörn Kamradt', 'Christian Sauer', 'Michael Stöckle', 'Rainer Grobholz']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Histopathology""","""['Impact of positive surgical margins on prostate-specific antigen failure after radical prostatectomy in adjuvant treatment-naïve patients.', 'Do margins matter?

RARP, however, necessitates patients to be placed in a steep Trendelenberg position, which presents multiple opportunities for complications relating to the positioning of the patient. Our study aims to study the prevalence and demographic predictors of these positioning complications and assess their impacts on length of stay (LOS) and total cost.  Patients and methods:   We included patients who underwent RP from 2008 to 2009 using data extracted from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample database. Positioning complications (eye, nerve, compartment syndrome/rhabdomyolysis) were identified using patient-level diagnosis and procedural International Classification of Disease, 9th edition, Clinical Modification codes. Logistic regression models assessed relationships between demographic factors and occurrence of complications and the effects of them on prolonged LOS and total inpatient cost.  Results:   Positioning complications occurred in 0.4% of cases with eye complications contributing the most to this frequency. Laparoscopic RP procedure (odds ratio [OR]=2.88, P<0.01) and comorbidities (OR=2.34, P<0.01) were highly associated with increased odds of positioning complication occurrence, whereas RARP procedures (OR=0.93, P>0.4) were not associated with positioning complications. Having positioning complications increased a patient's odds of having increased inpatient costs and extended LOS by almost 400% and 300%, respectively.  Conclusion:   The steep Trendelenberg position used in RARP was not shown to be associated with patient positioning-related complications in this sample.

In multivariable models, higher total T was associated with lower age, BMI and C-reactive protein, and with higher creatinine and haemoglobin, independently of SHBG. Higher DHT was associated with lower age, BMI and glucose level, and higher creatinine and haemoglobin. E2 was positively associated with age, BMI and haemoglobin.

Among the hits identified, Torrubiellutins (3a) showed good anticancer potential across the cells used in screening assays. Torrubiellutins are isolated from fungal insects Torrubiella luteorostrata and diverse pharmacological effects for these have been reported. However, it is not known as to how Torrubiellutins act through signaling pathways inhibiting the growth of eukaryotic cells. The current study aimed to determine the anticancer potential of Torrubiellutins by defining the molecular mechanism of cytotoxicity using DU145 cells. The results showed that the inhibition of prostate cancer cell growth by 3a was associated with inhibition of anchorage-independent growth, cell migration, and, to a small extent, apoptosis-mediated cell death by caspase activation. The growth-inhibitory effects of 3a are supported by inactivation of prosurvival pathways. Immunoblot analysis showed that the treatment of DU145 cells with 3a resulted in specific downregulation of AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and its downstream effector proteins p70S6K, GSK3β, and STAT3. On the basis of these findings, we propose that the changes observed in the AKT/mTOR signaling axis are new targets of 3a that are involved in its inhibitory activity on the proliferation of prostate cancer cells, suggesting its potential for further investigation as a promising anticancer agent.""","""['Ashita Singh', 'Bodugam Mahipal', 'Srivari Chandrasekhar', 'Ramesh Ummanni']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Anticancer Drugs""","""['Heat shock protein 90 is a promising target for effective growth inhibition of gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumors.', 'mTOR is a fine tuning molecule in CDK inhibitors-induced distinct cell death mechanisms via PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling axis in prostate cancer cells.', 'Mycotoxin verrucarin A inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in prostate cancer cells by inhibiting prosurvival Akt/NF-kB/mTOR signaling.', 'An α-acetoxy-tirucallic acid isomer inhibits Akt/mTOR signaling and induces oxidative stress in prostate cancer cells.', 'CWF-145, a novel synthetic quinolone derivative exerts potent antimitotic activity against human prostate cancer: Rapamycin enhances antimitotic drug-induced apoptosis through the inhibition of Akt/mTOR pathway.']"""

Mean follow-up was 33 months. Endpoint was biochemical progression-free (bPFS) survival. The impact of margin status and characteristics was assessed in time-dependent analyses using Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier methods.  Results:   PSM was reported in 26.7 % of patients. The predominant PSM locations were apex and posterior locations. Median PSM length was 4.0 mm. The 2-year bPFS was 73.7 % in PSM patients as compared to 93.0 % in NSM patients (p < 0.001).

In univariable analysis, extent and number of PSM were significantly linked to outcomes. None of PSM subclassifications significantly influenced the bPFS rates in the subgroup of pT2 disease patients. Conversely, stratification by PSM location (apex vs. other locations, p = 0.008), by PSM number (p = 0.006), and by PSM length (p < 0.001) showed significant differences in pT3-4 cancer patients.

Chromosomal rearrangements involving ETS transcription factors, such as ERG and ETV1, occur frequently in prostate cancer. How they contribute to tumorigenesis and whether they play similar or distinct in vivo roles remain elusive. Here we show that in mice with ERG or ETV1 targeted to the endogenous Tmprss2 locus, either factor cooperated with loss of a single copy of Pten, leading to localized cancer, but only ETV1 appeared to support development of invasive adenocarcinoma under the background of full Pten loss. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that ERG and ETV1 control a common transcriptional network but largely in an opposing fashion. In particular, while ERG negatively regulates the androgen receptor (AR) transcriptional program, ETV1 cooperates with AR signaling by favoring activation of the AR transcriptional program. Furthermore, we found that ETV1 expression, but not that of ERG, promotes autonomous testosterone production. Last, we confirmed the association of an ETV1 expression signature with aggressive disease and poorer outcome in patient data. The distinct biology of ETV1-associated prostate cancer suggests that this disease class may require new therapies directed to underlying programs controlled by ETV1.""","""['Aria F Olumi']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['ETV1 directs androgen metabolism and confers aggressive prostate cancer in targeted mice and patients.', 'ETV1 directs androgen metabolism and confers aggressive prostate cancer in targeted mice and patients.', 'Interaction of the Androgen Receptor, ETV1, and PTEN Pathways in Mouse Prostate Varies with Pathological Stage and Predicts Cancer Progression.', 'Distinct classes of chromosomal rearrangements create oncogenic ETS gene fusions in prostate cancer.', 'Emerging biological observations in prostate cancer.', 'ETS fusion genes in prostate cancer.', 'Dissecting the expression landscape of RNA-binding proteins in human cancers.']"""

Objective:   Our objective was to determine the effects of oral vitamin D3 on vitamin D metabolites and PCa proliferative activity in prostate tissue.  Design and setting:   We conducted a double-blind randomized clinical trial at surgical oncology clinics in Toronto, Canada.  Patients:   PCa patients (Gleason 6 or 7) participated in the study. Of 66 subjects who were enrolled, 63 completed the dosing protocol.  Intervention:   Vitamin D3 (400, 10000, or 40000 IU/d) was orally administered before radical prostatectomy.  Main outcome measures:   We evaluated vitamin D metabolite levels and Ki67 labeling in surgical prostate tissue. Safety measures, PTH, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) were also assessed.  Results:   Prostate tissue and serum levels of vitamin D metabolites, including calcitriol, increased dose dependently (P<.03) and were significantly higher in the 40000-IU/d group than in every other dose group (P<.03). Prostate vitamin D metabolites correlated positively with serum levels (P<.0001). Ki67 measures did not differ significantly among vitamin D dose groups. However, cross-sectional analysis indicated that the calcitriol level attained in prostate was inversely associated with Ki67 intensity and Ki67 (3+) percent positive nuclei in PCa and benign tissue (P<.05). Safety measures did not change adversely with dosing. Compared with the 400-IU/d group, serum PTH and PSA were lower in the combined higher-dose groups at the end of the study (P< .02).  Conclusions:   Oral vitamin D3 raised prostate calcitriol levels (level 1 evidence) and modestly lowered both PSA and PTH. Although Ki67 expression did not differ among dose groups, its levels correlated inversely with prostate calcitriol.

Radiation Therapy for prostate cancer can increase the risk for the development of second cancers after treatment. This study highlights the fact that such second cancers within the pelvis do occur but are not as common as previously reported. In this report we also note that even among patients who develop second cancers, if detected earlier, the majority are alive 5 years after the diagnosis.  Objective:   To report on the incidence of secondary malignancy (SM) development after external-beam radiotherapy (EBRT) and brachytherapy (BT) for prostate cancer and to compare this with a cohort contemporaneously treated with radical prostatectomy (RP).  Materials and methods:   Between 1998 and 2001, 2658 patients with localized prostate cancer were treated with RP (n = 1348), EBRT (n = 897) or BT (n = 413). Using the RP cohort as a control we compared the incidence of SMs, such as rectal or bladder cancers noted within the pelvis, and the incidence of extrapelvic SMs.  Results:   The 10-year SM-free survival for the RP, BT and EBRT cohorts were 89%, 87%, and 83%, respectively (RP vs EBRT, P = 0.002; RP vs BT, P = 0.37). The 10-year likelihoods for bladder or colorectal cancer SM development in the RP, BT and EBRT groups were 3%, 2% and 4%, respectively (P = 0.29). Multivariate analysis of predictors for development of all SMs showed that older age (P = 0.01) and history of smoking (P<0.001) were significant predictors for the development of a SM, while treatment intervention was not found to be a significant variable. Among 243 patients who developed a SM, the 5-year likelihood of SM-related mortality among patients with SMs in the EBRT and BT groups was 43.7% and 15.6%, respectively, compared with 26.3% in the RP cohort; (P = 0.052).  Conclusions:   The incidence of SM after radiotherapy was not significantly different from that after RP when adjusted for patient age and smoking history. The incidence of bladder and rectal cancers was low for both EBRT- and BT-treated patients.

Epub ahead of print""","""WHAT'S KNOWN ON THE SUBJECT? AND WHAT DOES THE STUDY ADD?: The recently published Prostate Cancer Intervention versus Observation Trial (PIVOT) did not identify differences in prostate cancer-specific mortality or all-cause mortality among patients with low-risk disease managed conservatively vs those managed definitively; however, recently published data suggest that older men may harbour more aggressive disease than is identified at biopsy owing to sampling error and undergrading. Whether older men with apparent low-risk disease are placed at risk of prostate cancer-specific mortality when managed conservatively remains unknown. The study used population-level data to show that non-curative approaches for older men with low-risk prostate cancer do result in an increased risk of prostate cancer-specific mortality. Differences between our study and the PIVOT trial include the fact that we included a larger sample size, analysed the data using an 'as-treated' approach, and included a healthier cohort of men as evinced by lower 4-year all-cause mortality estimates in our study than in the PIVOT. Our results suggest that older men with apparent low-risk prostate cancer are at risk of undergrading, which probably explains the differences in prostate cancer-specific mortality observed between men managed conservatively vs those managed definitively. Our study suggests that alternative approaches to excluding occult, high grade prostate cancer are needed in such men.  Objective:   To evaluate whether older age in men with low-risk prostate cancer increases the risk of prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM) when non-curative approaches are selected as initial management.  Patients and methods:   The study cohort consisted of 27 969 men, with a median age of 67 years, with prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-detected, low-risk prostate cancer (clinical category T1c, Gleason score≤6, and PSA≤10) identified by the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results programme between 2004 and 2007. Fine and Gray's competing risk regression analysis was used to evaluate whether management with non-curative vs curative therapy was associated with an increased risk of PCSM after adjusting for PSA level, age at diagnosis and year of diagnosis.  Results:   After a median follow-up of 2.75 years, 1121 men died, 60 (5.4%) from prostate cancer. Both older age (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR] 1.05; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02-1.08; P<0.001) and non-curative treatment (AHR 3.34; 95% CI 1.97-5.67; P<0.001) were significantly associated with an increased risk of PCSM. Men>the median age experienced increased estimates of PCSM when treated with non-curative as opposed to curative intent (P<0.001); this finding was not seen in men≤the median age (P = 0.17).  Conclusion:   Pending prospective validation, our study suggests that non-curative approaches for older men with 'low-risk' prostate cancer result in an increased risk of PCSM, suggesting the need for alternative approaches to exclude occult, high grade prostate cancer in these men.""","""['Mark A Ritter']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Initial management of prostate-specific antigen-detected, low-risk prostate cancer and the risk of death from prostate cancer.', 'Initial management of prostate-specific antigen-detected, low-risk prostate cancer and the risk of death from prostate cancer.', 'Advancing age within established Gleason score categories and the risk of prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM).', 'Early detection of high-grade prostate cancer using digital rectal examination (DRE) in men with a prostate-specific antigen level of <2.5 ng/mL and the risk of death.', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen-Based Screening for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Evidence Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.', 'Global update on defining and treating high-risk localized prostate cancer with leuprorelin: a USA perspective--identifying men at diagnosis who are at high risk of prostate cancer death after surgery or radiation therapy.', 'Endosomal gene expression: a new indicator for prostate cancer patient prognosis?']"""

In this study, we measured time-resolved autofluorescence in tumours and healthy tissues of the oral cavity ex vivo and calculated the corresponding fractal dimension which was significantly higher in tumours than in healthy tissues (1.8 vs. 1.6, P < 0.001, unpaired t-test) with non-overlapping 95% confidential intervals 1.88-1.84 and 1.57-1.69, respectively.

Thirty-nine patients with prostate cancer (median age, 77.9 years) with progressive disease after standard hormonal therapy were enrolled. Etoposide (25 mg, twice daily) and prednisone (5 mg, twice daily) were administered orally. Each cycle comprised 21 consecutive days of treatment followed by a 7-day drug holiday. All patients previously treated with an antiandrogen were required to undergo antiandrogen withdrawal prior to entry into the study. A total of 226 cycles were administered with a median of 6.7 cycles per patient (range, 1-18 cycles). Sixteen of 39 patients (41%) with elevated PSA levels at baseline achieved at least a 50% reduction in PSA levels. Median progression-free survival for all patients was 5.9 months (range, 1-17 months). No Grade 4 toxicities were observed. The predominant toxicities were mucositis, nausea, fatigue, and anemia in twelve, nine, eight, and seven patients, respectively. Hematologic toxicity was infrequent, with no episodes of febrile neutropenia.

Testosterone replacement therapy is effective in treating hypogonadism. However, for the millions of men with a history of prostate cancer, exogenous testosterone has long been considered contraindicated, even though little data in such men are available. Clarification of this safety issue could allow treatment to be considered for a sizeable segment of the aging male population.  Aim:   The aim of this study is to examine population-based utilization and impact of testosterone replacement therapy in men with prostate cancer.  Methods:   Using linked Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare data, we identified 149,354 men diagnosed with prostate cancer from 1992 to 2007. Of those, 1181 (0.79%) men received exogenous testosterone following their cancer diagnosis. We used propensity scoring analysis to examine the effect of testosterone replacement on the use of salvage hormone therapy and overall and prostate cancer-specific mortality.  Main outcome measures:   We assessed overall mortality, cancer-specific mortality, and the use of salvage hormone therapy.  Results:   Following prostate cancer diagnosis, testosterone replacement was directly related to income and educational status and inversely related to age (all P < 0.001). Men undergoing radical prostatectomy and men with well-differentiated tumors were more likely to receive testosterone (all P < 0.001). On adjusted analysis, testosterone replacement therapy was not associated with overall or cancer-specific mortality or with the use of salvage hormone therapy.  Conclusions:   In this population-based observational study of testosterone replacement therapy in men with a history of prostate cancer, treatment was not associated with increased overall or cancer-specific mortality. These findings suggest testosterone replacement therapy may be considered in men with a history of prostate cancer, but confirmatory prospective studies are needed.""","""['Alan L Kaplan', 'Quoc-Dien Trinh', 'Maxine Sun', 'Stacey C Carter', 'Paul L Nguyen', 'Ya-Chen Tina Shih', 'Leonard S Marks', 'Jim C Hu']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Sex Med""","""['Use of testosterone replacement therapy in the United States and its effect on subsequent prostate cancer outcomes.', 'Testosterone replacement therapy in men with prostate cancer: a time-varying analysis.', 'Testosterone replacement therapy in patients with prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy.', 'Testosterone Therapy Among Prostate Cancer Survivors.', 'Testosterone replacement therapy and the risk of prostate cancer.', 'The Role of Testosterone in the Elderly: What Do We Know?', 'A Selective Androgen Receptor Modulator (OPK-88004) in Prostate Cancer Survivors: A Randomized Trial.', 'Hypogonadism and its treatment among prostate cancer survivors.', 'Testosterone Replacement Therapy in Men with Untreated or Treated Prostate Cancer: Do We Have Enough Evidences?', 'Testosterone therapy does not increase the risks of prostate cancer recurrence or death after definitive treatment for localized disease.']"""

Our objective was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of PSA screening, with and without adjustment for quality of life, for the British Columbia (BC) population. We adapted an existing natural history model using BC incidence, treatment, cost and mortality patterns. The modeled mortality benefit of screening derives from a stage-shift mechanism, assuming mortality reduction consistent with the European Study of Randomized Screening for Prostate Cancer. The model projected outcomes for 40-year-old men under 14 combinations of screening ages and frequencies. Cost and utility estimates were explored with deterministic sensitivity analysis. The incremental cost-effectiveness of regular screening ranged from $36,300/LYG, for screening every four years from ages 55 to 69 years, to $588,300/LYG, for screening every two years from ages 40 to 74 years. The marginal benefits of increasing screening frequency to 2 years or starting screening at age 40 years were small and came at significant cost. After utility adjustment, all screening strategies resulted in a loss of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs); however, this result was very sensitive to utility estimates. Plausible outcomes under a range of screening strategies inform discussion of prostate cancer screening policy in BC and similar jurisdictions. Screening may be cost-effective, but the sensitivity of results to utility values suggests individual preferences for quality versus quantity of life should be a key consideration.""","""['Reka Pataky', 'Roman Gulati', 'Ruth Etzioni', 'Peter Black', 'Kim N Chi', 'Andrew J Coldman', 'Tom Pickles', 'Scott Tyldesley', 'Stuart Peacock']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Int J Cancer""","""['Cost-effectiveness of prostate cancer screening: a simulation study based on ERSPC data.', 'The Cost-Effectiveness of Prostate Cancer Detection with the Use of Prostate Health Index.', 'Economic Analysis of Prostate-Specific Antigen Screening and Selective Treatment Strategies.', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA)-Based Population Screening for Prostate Cancer: An Economic Analysis.', 'Cost-effectiveness of prostate cancer screening: a systematic review of decision-analytical models.', 'Health Care Costs Attributable to Prostate Cancer in British Columbia, Canada: A Population-Based Cohort Study.', 'Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Prostate Cancer Screening in the UK: A Decision Model Analysis Based on the CAP Trial.', 'China county-based prostate specific antigen screening for prostate cancer and a cost-effective analysis.', 'Cost-Effectiveness of the Use of Gold Anchor™ Markers in Prostate Cancer.', 'Assessment of harms, benefits, and cost-effectiveness of prostate cancer screening: A micro-simulation study of 230 scenarios.']"""

It is a promising prostate cancer treatment due to sparing of the tissues associated with morbidity risk from conventional therapies. IRE effects depend on electric field strength and tissue properties. These characteristics are organ-dependent, affecting IRE treatment outcomes. This study characterizes the relevant properties to improve treatment planning and outcome predictions for IRE prostate cancer treatment.  Methods:   Clinically relevant IRE pulse protocols were delivered to a healthy canine and two human cancerous prostates while measuring electrical parameters to determine tissue characteristics for predictive treatment simulations. Prostates were resected 5 hr, 3 weeks, and 4 weeks post-IRE. Lesions were correlated with numerical simulations to determine an effective prostate lethal IRE electric field threshold.  Results:   Lesions were produced in all subjects. Tissue electrical conductivity increased from 0.284 to 0.927 S/m due to IRE pulses. Numerical simulations show an average effective prostate electric field threshold of 1072 ± 119 V/cm, significantly higher than previously characterized tissues. Histological findings in the human cases show instances of complete tissue necrosis centrally with variable tissue effects beyond the margin.  Conclusions:   Preliminary experimental IRE trials safely ablated healthy canine and cancerous human prostates, as examined in the short- and medium-term. IRE-relevant prostate properties are now experimentally and numerically defined. Importantly, the electric field required to kill healthy prostate tissue is substantially higher than previously characterized tissues.

This malignancy is highly locally invasive, rarely metastatic and resistant to current therapies. Little is known about the distinct molecular biology of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) in terms of initiation and progression.

Homeodomain (HD) transcription factors play central roles in the expression of genomic information in all known eukaryotes. The TGIFX homeobox gene was originally discovered in human adult testes. Our previous study showed implications of TGIFLX in prostate cancer and azoospermia, although the molecular mechanism by which TGIFLX acts is unknown. Moreover, studies reported that HD proteins are involved in normal and abnormal brain developments. We examined the expression pattern of TGIFLX in different human brain tumor cell lines including U87MG, A172, Daoy and 1321N1. Interestingly, real time RT-PCR and western blot analysis revealed a high level of TGIFLX expression in A172 cells but not in the other cell lines. We subsequently cloned the entire coding sequence of TGIFLX gene into the pEGFP-N1 vector, eukaryotic expression vector encoding eGFP, and transfected into the U-87 MG cell line. The TGIFLX-GFP expression was confirmed by real time RT-PCR and UV-microscopic analysis. Upon transfection into U87 cells, fusion protein TGIFLX-GFP was found to locate mainly in the nucleus.

Materials and methods:   All newly diagnosed PCa patients with LNI treated with radiotherapy as primary therapy or after surgery, each with and without hormonal therapy (HT) between 1988 and 2009 were included.Thirty-five patients (38%) were managed with external beam radiotherapy alone (eRT), 18 patients (20%) with radical prostatectomy (RP)+adjuvant radiotherapy, and 38 patients (42%) with RP+salvage radiotherapy. Overall 82% of the study sample received HT with similar proportions among radiation therapy (RT) subsets (P=0.83).  Results:   The median follow-up (FU) was 65, 42, and 86 months for patients treated with eRT, adjuvant radiotherapy, and salvage radiotherapy, respectively.The 10-year estimates from start of primary therapy for patients with LNI for overall survival (OS) was 78% (95% confidence interval [CI], 62%-88%) and for cause-specific survival was 89% (95% CI, 78%-95%). The 5-year estimates from the start of RT for biochemically no evidence of disease was 68% (95% CI, 56%-78%) and for disease-free survival was 67% (95% CI, 54%-77%). There was no difference in any of these outcomes among the 3 RT groups.Patients treated with HT were more likely to have a better 10-year OS (82% vs. 66%; log rank: P=0.001).Multivariate analysis indicated that only age and Gleason score were significant predictors for biochemically no evidence of disease and OS.

Prostate cancer exosomes triggered TGFβ1-dependent fibroblast differentiation, to a distinctive myofibroblast phenotype resembling stromal cells isolated from cancerous prostate tissue; supporting angiogenesis in vitro and accelerating tumour growth in vivo.

However, the transition mechanism from androgen-dependent to -independent PCa after androgen depletion remains unclear. We investigated the distinct roles of small leucine zipper protein (sLZIP) in proliferation of androgen-dependent and -independent PCa cells. Cyclin D3 is known to interact with AR and attenuates the ligand-dependent function of AR in PCa cells. sLZIP regulates the transcription of cyclin D3 by binding directly to the AP-1 region in the cyclin D3 promoter. sLZIP represses AR transcriptional activity by interaction with AR that is phosphorylated by cyclin D3/cyclin-dependent kinase11(p58), leading to the suppression of androgen-dependent proliferation of PCa cells. The expression level of sLZIP is elevated in androgen-independent PCa cells and advanced human prostate tumors. Knockdown of endogenous sLZIP suppresses proliferation of androgen-independent PCa cells. LNCaP cells transformed to androgen-independent PCa cells exhibit increased expressions of sLZIP and cyclin D3. Tumor formation is inhibited in nude mouse xenografts from two androgen-independent PCa cells that are stably transfected with sh-sLZIP. Our findings indicate that sLZIP negatively regulates AR transactivation in androgen-dependent PCa cells and functions as a positive regulator in tumor progression of androgen-independent PCa. sLZIP contributes to the malignant phenotype of PCa and constitutes a novel therapeutic target for human PCa.""","""['Y Kim', 'J Kim', 'S-W Jang', 'J Ko']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['Cyclin D3 action in androgen receptor regulation and prostate cancer.', 'Nrdp1-mediated regulation of ErbB3 expression by the androgen receptor in androgen-dependent but not castrate-resistant prostate cancer cells.', 'Unique targeting of androgen-dependent and -independent AR signaling in prostate cancer to overcome androgen resistance.', 'Androgen action in the prostate gland.', 'The role of androgens and the androgen receptor in prostate cancer.', 'Small leucine zipper protein functions as a modulator for metabolic reprogramming of colorectal cancer cells by inducing nutrient stress-mediated autophagy.', 'Development of a novel transcription factors-related prognostic signature for serous ovarian cancer.', 'Posttranslational regulation of androgen dependent and independent androgen receptor activities in prostate cancer.', 'miR-138-5p suppresses glioblastoma cell viability and leads to cell cycle arrest by targeting cyclin D3.', 'Prognostic significance of cyclin D3 expression in malignancy patients: a meta-analysis.']"""

In this study, we propose a new approach to estimate the spatial geometric uncertainty of DIR using statistical sampling techniques that can be applied to the resulting deformation vector fields (DVFs) for a given registration. The proposed DIR performance metric, the distance discordance metric (DDM), is based on the variability in the distance between corresponding voxels from different images, which are co-registered to the same voxel at location (X) in an arbitrarily chosen 'reference' image. The DDM value, at location (X) in the reference image, represents the mean dispersion between voxels, when these images are registered to other images in the image set. The method requires at least four registered images to estimate the uncertainty of the DIRs, both for inter- and intra-patient DIR. To validate the proposed method, we generated an image set by deforming a software phantom with known DVFs. The registration error was computed at each voxel in the 'reference' phantom and then compared to DDM, inverse consistency error (ICE), and transitivity error (TE) over the entire phantom. The DDM showed a higher Pearson correlation (Rp) with the actual error (Rp ranged from 0.6 to 0.9) in comparison with ICE and TE (Rp ranged from 0.2 to 0.8). In the resulting spatial DDM map, regions with distinct intensity gradients had a lower discordance and therefore, less variability relative to regions with uniform intensity. Subsequently, we applied DDM for intra-patient DIR in an image set of ten longitudinal computed tomography (CT) scans of one prostate cancer patient and for inter-patient DIR in an image set of ten planning CT scans of different head and neck cancer patients. For both intra- and inter-patient DIR, the spatial DDM map showed large variation over the volume of interest (the pelvis for the prostate patient and the head for the head and neck patients). The highest discordance was observed in the soft tissues, such as the brain, bladder, and rectum, due to higher variability in the registration. The smallest DDM values were observed in the bony structures in the pelvis and the base of the skull. The proposed metric, DDM, provides a quantitative tool to evaluate the performance of DIR when a set of images is available. Therefore, DDM can be used to estimate and visualize the uncertainty of intra- and/or inter-patient DIR based on the variability of the registration rather than the absolute registration error.""","""['Ziad H Saleh', 'Aditya P Apte', 'Gregory C Sharp', 'Nadezhda P Shusharina', 'Ya Wang', 'Harini Veeraraghavan', 'Maria Thor', 'Ludvig P Muren', 'Shyam S Rao', 'Nancy Y Lee', 'Joseph O Deasy']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['A multiple-image-based method to evaluate the performance of deformable image registration in the pelvis.', 'An automated, quantitative, and case-specific evaluation of deformable image registration in computed tomography images.', 'A multivariable study of deformable image registration evaluation metrics in 4DCT of thoracic cancer patients.', '""Patient-specific validation of deformable image registration in radiation therapy: Overview and caveats"".', 'Evaluation of DIR algorithm performance in real patients for radiotherapy treatments: A systematic review of operator-dependent strategies.', 'Dose accumulation for MR-guided adaptive radiotherapy: From practical considerations to state-of-the-art clinical implementation.', 'An Open-Source Package for Thermal and Multispectral Image Analysis for Plants in Glasshouse.', 'Towards mid-position based Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy using online magnetic resonance imaging guidance for central lung tumours.', 'MIRSIG position paper: the use of image registration and fusion algorithms in radiotherapy.', 'A 3D cine-MRI acquisition technique and image analysis framework to quantify bowel motion demonstrated in gynecological cancer patients.']"""

Following androgen stimulation, Hic-5 rapidly translocates to the nucleus, coincident with increased phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase. As a coregulator, Hic-5 acted to amplify or inhibit regulation of approximately 50% of AR target genes, affected androgen regulation of growth, cell adhesion, motility and invasion. These data suggest Hic-5 as a transferable adaptor between focal adhesions and the nucleus of prostate myofibroblasts, where it acts a key mediator of the specificity and sensitivity of AR signaling.

We aimed to assess other important complications associated with these treatments for prostate cancer.  Methods:   We did a population-based retrospective cohort study, in which we used administrative hospital data, physician billing codes, and cancer registry data for men who underwent either surgery or radiotherapy alone for prostate cancer between 2002 and 2009 in Ontario, Canada. We measured the 5-year cumulative incidence of five treatment-related complication endpoints: hospital admissions; urological, rectal, or anal procedures; open surgical procedures; and secondary malignancies.  Findings:   In the 32 465 patients included in the study, the 5-year cumulative incidence of admission to hospital for a treatment-related complication was 22·2% (95% CI 21·7-22·7), but was 2·4% (2·2-2·6) for patients whose length of stay was longer than 1 day. The 5-year cumulative incidence of needing a urological procedure was 32·0% (95% CI 31·4-32·5), that of a rectal or anal procedure was 13·7% (13·3-14·1), and that of an open surgical procedure was 0·9% (0·8-1·1). The 5-year cumulative incidence of a second primary malignancy was 3·0% (2·6-3·5). These risks were significantly higher than were those of 32 465 matched controls with no history of prostate cancer. Older age and comorbidity at the time of index treatment were important predictors for a complication in all outcome categories, but the type of treatment received was the strongest predictor for complications. Patients who were given radiotherapy had higher incidence of complications for hospital admissions, rectal or anal procedures, open surgical procedures, and secondary malignancies at 5 years than did those who underwent surgery (adjusted hazard ratios 2·08-10·8, p<0·0001). However, the number of urological procedures was lower in the radiotherapy than in the surgery group (adjusted hazard ratio 0·66, 95% CI 0·63-0·69; p<0·0001) INTERPRETATION: Complications after prostate cancer treatment are frequent and dependent on age, comorbidity, and the type of treatment.

Materials and methods:   Men with a body mass index of less than 40 kg/m(2) who had newly diagnosed prostate cancer and elected robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy were included in analysis. Block randomization by surgeon was used and randomization assignment was done after completing the urethrovesical anastomosis.

Methods:   Human prostate cancer cell lines (PC3, CWR22Rv1, LNCaP, and DU145) were incubated for 2 h and 24 h in glucose-containing (5.5 mM) Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) with varying concentrations of the free fatty acid palmitate (0-1.0 mM). Then the cells were incubated with [(18)F]-FDG (1 μCi/mL; 0.037 MBq/mL) in DMEM either in presence or absence of glucose and in presence of varying concentrations of palmitate for 1 h. Standardized procedures regarding cell counting and measuring for (18)F radioactivity were applied. Cell uptake studies with (14)C-1-acetate under the same conditions were performed on PC3 cells.  Results:   In glucose containing media there was significantly increased FDG uptake after 24 h incubation in all cell lines, except DU145, when upper physiological levels of palmitate were added. A 4-fold increase of FDG uptake in PC3 cells (15.11% vs. 3.94%/10(6) cells) was observed in media with 1.0 mM palmitate compared to media with no palmitate. The same tendency was observed in PC3 and CWR22Rv1 cells after 2 h incubation. In glucose-free media no significant differences in FDG uptake after 24 h incubation were observed. The significant differences after 2 h incubation all pointed in the direction of increased FDG uptake when palmitate was added. Acetate uptake in PC3 cells was significantly lower when palmitate was added in glucose-free DMEM. No clear tendency when comparing FDG or acetate uptake in the same media at different time points of incubation was observed.  Conclusions:   Our results indicate a FFA dependent metabolic boost/switch of glucose uptake in PCa, with patterns reflecting the true heterogeneity of the disease.""","""['Kim Francis Andersen', 'Vadim Divilov', 'Kuntalkumar Sevak', 'Jacek Koziorowski', 'Jason S Lewis', 'NagaVarakishore Pillarsetty']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Nucl Med Biol""","""['Antilipolytic drug boosts glucose metabolism in prostate cancer.', 'Do androgens control the uptake of 18F-FDG, 11C-choline and 11C-acetate in human prostate cancer cell lines?', 'Dominant uptake of fatty acid over glucose by prostate cells: a potential new diagnostic and therapeutic approach.', 'Effect of hypoxia on the uptake of methyl-3Hcholine, 1-14C acetate and 18FFDG in cultured prostate cancer cells.', 'Imaging of cardiac metabolism using radiolabelled glucose, fatty acids and acetate.', 'Can the Mitochondrial Metabolic Theory Explain Better the Origin and Management of Cancer than Can the Somatic Mutation Theory?', 'An Amplified Fatty Acid-Binding Protein Gene Cluster in Prostate Cancer: Emerging Roles in Lipid Metabolism and Metastasis.', 'On the Origin of ATP Synthesis in Cancer.', 'The FABP12/PPARγ pathway promotes metastatic transformation by inducing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and lipid-derived energy production in prostate cancer cells.', 'Free Fatty Acids Promote the Development of Prostate Cancer by Upregulating Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor Gamma.']"""

Material and methods:   A prospective intervention clinical study was designed in 16 patients with indication of RP who were randomized into two groups. The Control Group received routine pre-surgical education (hygienic-dietary measures). The intervention group received a training session with supervised PFMT, three times a day, for four weeks, 30 days before the PR. Muscle function of the external urethral sphincter, contraction pressure of the levator ani, urinary continence and quality of life related to health (HRQoL) were evaluated before and after the intervention. At the end of the intervention and day of the surgery, samples of residual muscle tissue were obtained from the external sphincter muscle of the urethra for histomorphometric analysis.  Results:   After the intervention, those participants who carried out PFMT showed an increase in the cross-sectional area of the muscle fibers of the external urethral sphincter (1,313 ± 1,075 μm(2)vs. 1,056 ± 844 μm(2), P=.03) and higher pressure contraction of the levator ani (F=9.188; P=.010). After catheter removal, 62% of patients in the experimental group and 37% in the control group showed no incontinence. After removal of the catheter, 75% of the experimental group did not require any pad compared to 25% in the control group (p=NS). There were no significant differences between the two groups in any of the HRQoL domains studied.

However, reports suggest that obtaining procedure prices remains challenging and highly variable.  Materials and methods:   We used 2011-2012 US News and World Report rankings to identify a cohort of 100 hospitals making an effort to include an equal distribution of both academic and private centers, city size, and geographic region. Each hospital was called and the essence of the script included a caller stating he was a healthy, uninsured 55-year-old man recently diagnosed with Gleason 3 + 4 prostatic adenocarcinoma with no metastases. Facility, surgeon, and anesthesia fees were solicited.  Results:   Seventy hospitals provided facility prices. Facility estimates averaged $34,720 (±20,335; range, $10,100-$135,000), which was statistically higher at academics centers. No significant differences were seen by region, population, or hospital ranking. Surgeon and anesthesia fees were provided by 10%, averaging $8280 (±$4282; range, $4028-$18,720). Thirty-three hospitals provided discounted fees for prompt payment averaging 34% (±16%; range, 10%-80%).  Conclusion:   There is wide variation in pricing for RP, with higher rates found in academic centers. Wide variation in facility costs were observed, and nearly all were unable to provide surgeon and/or anesthesia fees.

In Spain, follow-up is usually carried out in oncology services, but knowledge of cancer survivors' health care needs in this context is limited. The purpose of this study was to ascertain the health status of long-term survivors of breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer and to characterize their use of health care services.  Methods:   Retrospective multicenter cohort study. We collected data from patients' clinical histories and through telephone interviews, using a specially designed questionnaire that included the SF-36v2 Quality of Life and Nottingham Health Profile scales.  Results:   The questionnaire was completed by 51.2% (n= 583) of the potential sample. No significant differences were observed between 5-year and 10-year survivors. Overall, more than 80% of respondents were undergoing drug treatment for morbidity related to advanced age. Quality of life was good in most patients, and cancer-related morbidity was low and of little complexity. For the most part, participants reported using primary care services for care of chronic diseases and opportunistic treatment of sequelae related to the cancer treatment. Oncological follow-up was centralized at the hospital.  Conclusions:   Survivors of breast, prostate and colorectal cancer with tumoral detection at an early stage and without recurrences or second neoplasms experienced little morbidity and enjoyed good quality of life.

Objective:   The purpose of this study was to evaluate the possible association between alopecia and thyroid cancer among Taiwanese women.  Methods:   We used data from the National Health Insurance system of Taiwan. The alopecia cohort comprised 4534 women, and each woman was randomly frequency matched by age, index month, and index year with 4 women from the general population without alopecia. A Cox proportional hazard regression analysis with Bonferroni correction was conducted to estimate the effects of alopecia on the risk of thyroid cancer.  Results:   In women with alopecia, the overall risk for developing cancer was 22% higher than for subjects without alopecia, but the difference was not significant [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.22, 97.5% confidence interval (97.5% CI) = 0.87-1.70]. However, the risk for developing thyroid cancer among women with alopecia was significantly higher (HR = 2.39, 97.5% CI = 1.05-5.42). Further analyses determined that the alopecia group had a higher incidence of Graves' disease, but not Hashimoto thyroiditis.

Methods:   We used linked national Veterans Affairs and Medicare data to determine the value of the first screening PSA test (ng/mL) of 327,284 men older than 65 years who underwent PSA screening in the Veterans Affairs health care system in 2003. We calculated the proportion of men with an abnormal PSA result based on age, race, and common PSA thresholds.  Results:   Among men older than 65 years, 8.4% had a PSA >4.0 ng/mL. The percentage of men with a PSA >4.0 ng/mL increased with age and was highest in black men (13.8%) vs white (8.0%) or Latino men (10.0%) (P <.001). Combining age and race, the probability of having a PSA >4.0 ng/mL ranged from 5.1% of Latino men aged 65-69 years to 27.4% of black men older than 85 years. Raising the PSA threshold from >4.0 ng/mL to >10.0 ng/mL reclassified the greatest percentage of black men older than 85 years (18.3% absolute change) and the lowest percentage of Latino men aged 65-69 years (4.8% absolute change) as being under the biopsy threshold (P <.001).  Conclusion:   Age, race, and PSA threshold together affect the pretest probability of an abnormal screening PSA result. Based on screening PSA distributions, stopping screening among men whose PSA <3 ng/mL means more than 80% of white and Latino men older than 70 years would stop further screening, and increasing the biopsy threshold to >10 ng/mL has the greatest effect on reducing the number of older black men who will face biopsy decisions after screening.""","""['Roxanne Espaldon', 'Katharine A Kirby', 'Kathy Z Fung', 'Richard M Hoffman', 'Adam A Powell', 'Stephen J Freedland', 'Louise C Walter']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Urology""","""['Editorial comment.', 'Total, free, and percent free prostate-specific antigen levels among U.S. men, 2001-04.', 'Understanding PSA and its derivatives in prediction of tumor volume: Addressing health disparities in prostate cancer risk stratification.', 'Prostate-specific antigen testing in black and white men: an analysis of medicare claims from 1991-1998.', 'Prostate-specific antigen concentration in young men: new estimates and review of the literature.', 'Age-specific distribution of serum prostate-specific antigen in a community-based study of African-American men.', 'Ethnic differences in prostate-specific antigen levels in men without prostate cancer: a systematic review.', 'Molecular mechanisms of curcumin and its semisynthetic analogues in prostate cancer prevention and treatment.', 'Racial disparities in prostate cancer incidence rates by census division in the United States, 1999-2008.']"""

We have recently identified TMEPAI as a direct target gene of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)/Smad signaling that participates in negative feedback control of the duration and intensity of TGF-β/Smad signaling. TMEPAI is constitutively and highly expressed in many types of cancer and is associated with poor prognosis. Here, we report that TMEPAI is highly expressed in the lung adenocarcinoma cell lines Calu3, NCI-H23, and RERF-LC-KJ. Expression of TMEPAI in these cancer cells was significantly suppressed by a TGF-β receptor kinase antagonist, SB208, and by TGF-β neutralizing antibodies. These results suggest that constitutive expression of TMEPAI in these cancer cells depends on autocrine TGF-β stimulation. Knockdown of TMEPAI in Calu3 and NCI-H23 cells enhanced levels of Smad2 phosphorylation and significantly suppressed cell proliferation in the presence of TGF-β, indicating that highly expressed TMEPAI suppresses levels of Smad phosphorylation in these cancer cells and reduces the growth inhibitory effects of TGF-β/Smad signaling. Furthermore, knockdown of TMEPAI in Calu3 and NCI-H23 cells suppressed sphere formation in vitro and tumor formation in s.c. tissues and in lungs after tail vein injection in NOD-SCID mice in vivo.

Interestingly, the F-actin cross-linking and stabilizing protein L-plastin, originally described as a leukocyte specific protein, is aberrantly expressed in several non-hematopoietic malignant tumors. Therefore, it has been discussed as a tumor marker. However, systematic in vivo analyses of the functional relevance of L-plastin for tumor cell metastasis were so far lacking.  Methods:   We investigated the relevance of L-plastin expression and phosphorylation by ectopical expression of L-plastin in human melanoma cells (MV3) and knock-down of endogenous L-plastin in prostate cancer (PC3M). The growth and metastatic potential of tumor cells expressing no L-plastin, phosphorylatable or non-phosphorylatable L-plastin was analyzed in a preclinical mouse model after subcutaneous and intracardial injection of the tumor cells.  Results:   Knock-down of endogenous L-plastin in human prostate carcinoma cells led to reduced tumor cell growth and metastasis. Vice versa, and in line with these findings, ectopic expression of L-plastin in L-plastin negative melanoma cells significantly increased the number of metastases. Strikingly, the metastasis promoting effect of L-plastin was not observed if a non-phosphorylatable L-plastin mutant was expressed.  Conclusions:   Our data provide the first in vivo evidence that expression of L-plastin promotes tumor metastasis and, importantly, that this effect depends on an additionally required phosphorylation of L-plastin. In conclusion, these findings imply that for determining the importance of tumor-associated proteins like L-plastin a characterization of posttranslational modifications is indispensable.""","""['Selina M Riplinger', 'Guido H Wabnitz', 'Henning Kirchgessner', 'Beate Jahraus', 'Felix Lasitschka', 'Bianca Schulte', 'Gabri van der Pluijm', 'Geertje van der Horst', 'Günter J Hämmerling', 'Inaam Nakchbandi', 'Yvonne Samstag']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Mol Cancer""","""['L-plastin Ser5 phosphorylation is modulated by the PI3K/SGK pathway and promotes breast cancer cell invasiveness.', 'Phosphorylation of ectopically expressed L-plastin enhances invasiveness of human melanoma cells.', 'Quantitative kinetic study of the actin-bundling protein L-plastin and of its impact on actin turn-over.', 'Plastins: versatile modulators of actin organization in (patho)physiological cellular processes.', 'The actin-bundling protein L-plastin supports T-cell motility and activation.', 'The Potential Role of Exosomal Proteins in Prostate Cancer.', 'Allosteric regulation controls actin-bundling properties of human plastins.', 'L-Plastin Phosphorylation: Possible Regulation by a TNFR1 Signaling Cascade in Osteoclasts.', 'L-plastin Ser5 phosphorylation is modulated by the PI3K/SGK pathway and promotes breast cancer cell invasiveness.', 'T-Plastin reinforces membrane protrusions to bridge matrix gaps during cell migration.']"""

Experimental therapy with CAR-engineered T cells has also shown promising results on solid tumors. The prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA) is a protein expressed on the surface of prostate epithelial cells as well as in primary and metastatic prostate cancer cells and therefore a promising target for immunotherapy of prostate cancer.  Methods:   We developed a third-generation CAR against PSCA including the CD28, OX-40 and CD3 ζ signaling domains. T cells were transduced with a lentivirus encoding the PSCA-CAR and evaluated for cytokine production (paired Student's t-test), proliferation (paired Student's t-test), CD107a expression (paired Student's t-test) and target cell killing in vitro and tumor growth and survival in vivo (Log-rank test comparing Kaplan-Meier survival curves).  Results:   PSCA-CAR T cells exhibit specific interferon (IFN)-γ and interleukin (IL)-2 secretion and specific proliferation in response to PSCA-expressing target cells.

This IGF-IR up-regulation is not blocked by classical antiandrogens and sensitizes cells to IGF-I-induced biological effects. Metformin exerts complex antitumoral functions in various models and may inhibit CREB activation in hepatocytes. We, therefore, evaluated whether metformin may affect androgen-dependent IGF-IR up-regulation. In the AR(+) LNCaP prostate cancer cells, we found that metformin inhibits androgen-induced CRE activity and IGF-IR gene transcription. CRE activity requires the formation of a CREB-CREB binding protein-CREB regulated transcription coactivator 2 (CRTC2) complex, which follows Ser133-CREB phosphorylation. Metformin inhibited Ser133-CREB phosphorylation and induced nuclear exclusion of CREB cofactor CRTC2, thus dissociating the CREB-CREB binding protein-CRTC2 complex and blocking its transcriptional activity. Similarly to metformin action, CRTC2 silencing inhibited IGF-IR promoter activity. Moreover, metformin blocked membrane-initiated signals of AR to the mammalian target of rapamycin/p70S6Kinase pathway by inhibiting AR phosphorylation and its association with c-Src. AMPK signals were also involved to some extent. By inhibiting androgen-dependent IGF-IR up-regulation, metformin reduced IGF-I-mediated proliferation of LNCaP cells. These results indicate that, in prostate cancer cells, metformin inhibits IGF-I-mediated biological effects by disrupting membrane-initiated AR action responsible for IGF-IR up-regulation and suggest that metformin could represent a useful adjunct to the classical antiandrogen therapy.""","""['Roberta Malaguarnera', 'Antonella Sacco', 'Alaide Morcavallo', 'Sebastiano Squatrito', 'Antimo Migliaccio', 'Andrea Morrione', 'Marcello Maggiolini', 'Antonino Belfiore']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Endocrinology""","""['Androgens up-regulate the insulin-like growth factor-I receptor in prostate cancer cells.', 'Role of cyclic AMP response element-binding protein in insulin-like growth factor-i receptor up-regulation by sex steroids in prostate cancer cells.', 'Changes in androgen receptor nongenotropic signaling correlate with transition of LNCaP cells to androgen independence.', 'Interaction of IGF signaling and the androgen receptor in prostate cancer progression.', 'Expression and function of androgen receptor coactivators in prostate cancer.', 'Systematic review of antitumour efficacy and mechanism of metformin activity in prostate cancer models.', 'Metformin regulates multiple signaling pathways within castration-resistant human prostate cancer cells.', 'Insulin-like growth factor role in determining the anti-cancer effect of metformin: RCT in prostate cancer patients.', 'Metformin and Covid-19: Focused Review of Mechanisms and Current Literature Suggesting Benefit.', 'Inhibition of Janus Kinase 1 synergizes docetaxel sensitivity in prostate cancer cells.']"""

Nested case-control studies were conducted in the Breast and Prostate Cancer Cohort Consortium (BPC3), consisting of nine cohorts. The analyses included over 10726 post-menopausal breast and 7532 prostate cancer cases with matched controls. Logistic regression models were used to evaluate associations with risk, and proportional hazard models were used for survival outcomes. We did not observe significant interactions between polymorphisms in MnSOD and GPX-1, or between mitochondrial polymorphisms and alcohol intake and risk of either breast (p-interaction of 0.34 and 0.98, respectively) or prostate cancer (p-interaction of 0.49 and 0.50, respectively). We observed a weak inverse association between prostate cancer risk and GPX-1 Leu198Leu carriers (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.79-0.97, p = 0.01). Overall survival among women with breast cancer was inversely associated with G10398 carriers who consumed alcohol (HR 0.66 95% CI 0.49-0.88).

In this study, HSP27 expression according to the prostate cancer malignancy level was evaluated, and HSP27 expression was also analyzed after inducing apoptosis by doxazosin treatment of the prostate cancer cell lines.  Materials and methods:   Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunofluorescence staining of the HSP27 was implemented by the culture of RWPE-1, LNCaP, androgen-independent human prostate cancer cells (PC-3), and TSU-Pr1 cell lines. Analysis was separately conducted in the control group, control vector group treated by dimethyl sulfoxide, and groups treated with 10 µM or 25 µM doxazosin. The expression of HSP27 in RT-PCR and immunofluorescence staining was observed and evaluated after conversion to numerical values.  Results:   In the RT-PCR results, depending on the cell type, LNCaP, TSU-Pr1 showed the highest HSP27 expression followed by PC-3, LNCaP and RWPE-1 in sequence. After doxazosin treatment, the expression detected by RT-PCR was stronger at a 25-µM doxazosin concentration compared to that at a 10-µM concentration, and the result was similar by immunofluorescence staining.  Conclusions:   HSP27 expression increased depending on the prostate cancer cell line. This meant that HSP27 expression was related to the prostate cancer malignancy level.

Recent reports indicate that adipose stromal cells (ASCs) play an important role in breast cancer development and progression by producing estrogens and tumor-promoting cytokines. Furthermore, circulating ASCs have been uniquely detected in obese individuals, which is likely due to increased tissue remodeling and cell mobilization. The number of circulating ASCs is even more prominent in obese patients with colon and prostate cancers, both of which are exacerbated by obesity. To determine whether a similar association exists for breast cancer, we collected blood samples from a cohort of breast cancer survivors and enumerated circulating ASCs by flow cytometry on the basis of the previously established ASC-associated immunophenotype (CD34+/CD31-/CD45-). We found significantly higher levels of circulating ASCs (p<0.001) in breast cancer survivors with body mass index (BMI)≥30 kg/m2 than their non-obese counterparts (BMI<30). We also compared circulating ASCs before and after exercise of only the obese subjects enrolled in a 6-month individualized exercise program, but found no statistically significant difference, likely due to limited number of subjects in the study.

Results:   A confirmed PSA response was observed in 44 out of 108 assessable patients (41%, 95% confidence interval 31%-50%). In univariate analysis, lower pre-abiraterone baseline levels of lactate dehydrogenase, an NLR ≤ 5 and restricted metastatic spread to either bone or lymph nodes were each associated with PSA response. In multivariable analysis, only low NLR and restricted metastatic spread remained statistically significant. A score derived as the sum of these two categorical variables was associated with response to abiraterone (P = 0.007). Logistic regression analysis on an independent validation cohort of 245 patients verified that this score was associated with response to abiraterone (P = 0.003).

The serine/threonine kinase casein kinase 2 (CK2) has a well-reported role in prostate cancer resistance to apoptotic agents or anticancer drugs. However, the mechanistic understanding on how CK2 supports survival is far from complete. In this work, we demonstrate both in rat and humans that (i) Par-4 is a new substrate of the survival kinase CK2 and (ii) phosphorylation by CK2 impairs Par-4 proapoptotic functions. We also unravel different levels of CK2-dependent regulation of Par-4 between species. In rats, the phosphorylation by CK2 at the major site, S124, prevents caspase-mediated Par-4 cleavage (D123) and consequently impairs the proapoptotic function of Par-4. In humans, CK2 strongly impairs the apoptotic properties of Par-4, independently of the caspase-mediated cleavage of Par-4 (D131), by triggering the phosphorylation at residue S231. Furthermore, we show that human Par-4 residue S231 is highly phosphorylated in prostate cancer cells as compared with their normal counterparts. Finally, the sensitivity of prostate cancer cells to apoptosis by CK2 knockdown is significantly reversed by parallel knockdown of Par-4. Thus, Par-4 seems a critical target of CK2 that could be exploited for the development of new anticancer drugs.""","""['A de Thonel', 'A Hazoumé', 'V Kochin', 'K Isoniemi', 'G Jego', 'E Fourmaux', 'A Hammann', 'H Mjahed', 'O Filhol', 'O Micheau', 'P Rocchi', 'V Mezger', 'J E Eriksson', 'V M Rangnekar', 'C Garrido']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Cell Death Dis""","""['Role of protein kinase CK2 in the regulation of tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis inducing ligand-induced apoptosis in prostate cancer cells.', 'Influence of casein kinase II in tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand-induced apoptosis in human rhabdomyosarcoma cells.', 'Intracellular hydrogen peroxide production is an upstream event in apoptosis induced by down-regulation of casein kinase 2 in prostate cancer cells.', 'CK2 signaling in androgen-dependent and -independent prostate cancer.', 'Casein kinase 2, the versatile regulator of cell survival.', 'Structural Analysis of the cl-Par-4 Tumor Suppressor as a Function of Ionic Environment.', ""Prostate apoptosis response-4 and tumor suppression: it's not just about apoptosis anymore."", 'In Vivo Evaluation of Combined CK2 Inhibition and Irradiation in Human WiDr Tumours.', 'Coordinated targeting of CK2 and KIT in gastrointestinal stromal tumours.', 'Par-4 overexpression impedes leukemogenesis in the Eµ-TCL1 leukemia model through downregulation of NF-κB signaling.']"""

Cells were assessed by Western blot analysis, MTT in vitro proliferation assay, and ELISA.  Results:   Group 2 showed stronger reactivity for AR and HOXB13 than those of the group 1. MTT assay showed death of LNCaP cells at 25uM of 5ARI. At the same time, ELISA assay for PSA showed that 5ARI inhibited secretion of PSA in LNCaP cells. Western blot analysis showed that 5ARI did not greatly alter AR expression but it stimulated the expression of HOXB13.

Among them, 249 patients with single positive core PCa were followed up, and the clinical and pathological parameters influencing prognosis were analyzed.

Several surgical methods to improve continence have been described however with contradictory results.  Objective:   To determine whether a modified surgical technique during laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (LRP) improves postoperative continence.  Patients and methods:   This is a prospective nonrandomized study with two consecutive series of 100 patients in each group. The first group from 2005 to 2008 underwent a standard LRP. The second group from 2009 to 2011 was subjected to a modified LRP by sparing of puboprostatic ligaments, including the preservation of arcus tendineous, and using a simple posterior tension-releasing suture adapting the urethra stump to the bladder before the anastomosis. The patients had the same preoperative work-up and comparable preoperative baseline characteristics. The 2-year follow-up of the patients included a continence questionnaire and International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS). Urinary peak flow (Qmax) and post-void residual (PVR) volume were assessed at 3 months. Continence was defined as 0-1 pad/day.  Results:   Only 99 patients were evaluated in each group. The patients had comparable operative characteristics. The continence rates after the modified technique vs the standard were 33% vs 16%, p=0.007 at 1 month; 66% vs 44%, p=0.002 at 3 months; 81% vs 67%, p=0.034 at 6 months; 92% vs 80%, p=0.024 at 12 months; and 95% vs 86%, p=0.05 at 2 years. No significant differences were found regarding voiding functions, the Qmax, the PVR volume, or the IPSS. Three patients developed urethral stricture in the standard group compared with none in the modified group. The negative margin rates were unchanged.

It has been shown in transfected cells that accessory proteins known as Receptor Activity Modifying Proteins (RAMPs), specifically RAMPs 1 and 3, are required for cell-surface trafficking of the CaSR. These effects have only been demonstrated in transfected cells, so their physiological relevance is unclear. Here we explored CaSR/RAMP interactions in detail, and showed that in thyroid human carcinoma cells, RAMP1 is required for trafficking of the CaSR. Furthermore, we show that normal RAMP1 function is required for intracellular responses to ligands. Specifically, to confirm earlier studies with tagged constructs, and to provide the additional benefit of quantitative stoichiometric analysis, we used fluorescence resonance energy transfer to show equal abilities of RAMP1 and 3 to chaperone CaSR to the cell surface, though RAMP3 interacted more efficiently with the receptor. Furthermore, a higher fraction of RAMP3 than RAMP1 was observed in CaSR-complexes on the cell-surface, suggesting different ratios of RAMPs to CaSR. In order to determine relevance of these findings in an endogenous expression system we assessed the effect of RAMP1 siRNA knock-down in medullary thyroid carcinoma TT cells, (which express RAMP1, but not RAMP3 constitutively) and measured a significant 50% attenuation of signalling in response to CaSR ligands Cinacalcet and neomycin. Blockade of RAMP1 using specific antibodies induced a concentration-dependent reduction in CaSR-mediated signalling in response to Cinacalcet in TT cells, suggesting a novel functional role for RAMP1 in regulation of CaSR signalling in addition to its known role in receptor trafficking. These data provide evidence that RAMPs traffic the CaSR as higher-level oligomers and play a role in CaSR signalling even after cell surface localisation has occurred.""","""['Aditya J Desai', 'David J Roberts', 'Gareth O Richards', 'Timothy M Skerry']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Receptor-activity-modifying proteins are required for forward trafficking of the calcium-sensing receptor to the plasma membrane.', 'Regulation of calcium sensing receptor trafficking by RAMPs.', 'Structure-function analysis of amino acid 74 of human RAMP1 and RAMP3 and its role in peptide interactions with adrenomedullin and calcitonin gene-related peptide receptors.', 'Identification of N-terminal receptor activity-modifying protein residues important for calcitonin gene-related peptide, adrenomedullin, and amylin receptor function.', 'Calcium-Sensing Receptor: Trafficking, Endocytosis, Recycling, and Importance of Interacting Proteins.', 'Elucidating the Interactome of G Protein-Coupled Receptors and Receptor Activity-Modifying Proteins.', 'Accelerated Development With Increased Bone Mass and Skeletal Response to Loading Suggest Receptor Activity Modifying Protein-3 as a Bone Anabolic Target.', 'RAMPs as allosteric modulators of the calcitonin and calcitonin-like class B G protein-coupled receptors.', 'Dawn of a New RAMPage.', 'RAMP3 determines rapid recycling of atypical chemokine receptor-3 for guided angiogenesis.']"""

Here we identified pre-operative predictors of early BCR within a surgical cohort who recurred.  Methods:   An institutional prostate cancer (PCa) database containing over 20,000 patients was queried to identify 1,471 men who had BCR after RP, and pre-operative predictors of early versus late BCR were assessed. Early BCR was defined as recurrence within 1 year after RP. Within the recurrence cohort, those with National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) high-risk features were more likely to experience early BCR. Therefore, in all NCCN high-risk men in the database, we abstracted detailed pathologic biopsy data. Among 753 high-risk men, 41 alternate multivariable criteria were assessed for their ability to predict early BCR in crude and adjusted logistic regression models.  Results:   The criteria that best identified those likely to experience early BCR are primary Gleason pattern 5 on biopsy or ≥4 cores containing pattern 4 (odds ratio 3.17, P < 0.001). These criteria included 26.7% of NCCN high-risk men. Additionally, these criteria selected for men within the high-risk classification who were at significantly higher risk of subsequent metastasis (adjusted hazard ratio 3.04, P < 0.001) and cancer-specific death (adjusted hazard ratio 3.27, P < 0.001).  Conclusions:   In men with PCa who present with high-risk features, pre-operative criteria have the ability to discriminate the subgroup most likely to experience early BCR after RP.

In this study, we explored the effect of small hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting LASS2/TMSG1 on the invasion and metastasis of human prostate carcinoma cell line PC-3M-2B4 with low metastatic potential and its functional interaction with V-ATPase. Silencing of LASS2/TMSG1 gene in PC-3M-2B4 cells increased V-ATPase activity, extracellular hydrogen ion concentration and in turn the activation of secreted MMP-2 and MMP-9, which coincided with enhancing cell proliferation, cell survival, and cell invasion in vitro, as well as acceleration of prostate cancer (PCA) growth and lymph node metastases in vivo.

These data indicate that atorvastatin modulates invasiveness via P2X7, EHBP1 and P-Rex1. Interestingly, the interaction between EHBP1 and P-Rex1 was not induced by extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the endogenous P2X7 ligand, and statins counteracted invasiveness stimulated by extracellular ATP.

Since pre-cancerous lesions, i.e., the high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN), can be detected years before progression to PC, early diagnosis and chemoprevention are targeted strategies to reduce PC rates. Animal studies have shown that lycopene, a carotenoid contained in tomatoes, is a promising candidate for the chemoprevention of PC. However, its efficacy in humans remains controversial. The present study aimed to investigate the relevance of plasma and prostate concentration of lycopene after a lycopene-enriched diet in patients diagnosed with HGPIN. Thirty-two patients diagnosed with HGPIN were administered a lycopene-enriched diet (20-25 mg/day of lycopene; through 30 g/day of triple concentrated tomato paste) for 6 months. A 6-month follow-up prostate biopsy assessed progression to PC. Patients were classified into three groups according to the histopathological features of the 6-month follow-up biopsy results: prostatitis; HGPIN and PC. PSA and plasma lycopene levels were measured before and after the dietary lycopene supplementation. Prostatic lycopene concentration was only assessed after the supplementation diet. Only prostatic lycopene concentration showed significant differences between the three groups (p = 0.03). Prostatic lycopene concentration below a 1 ng/mg threshold was associated with PC at 6-month follow-up biopsy (p = 0.003). We observed no overall benefits from a 6-month lycopene supplementation, as the rate of HGPIN progression to PC in our population (9/32, 28%) was similar to rates reported in the literature. Baseline PSA levels also showed no significant changes after a lycopene-enriched diet. Our findings point to prostatic lycopene concentration as a promising biomarker of PC. Further prospective longitudinal studies are needed to assess the prognostic role of prostatic lycopene in PC.""","""['Simone Mariani', 'Luana Lionetto', 'Michele Cavallari', 'Andrea Tubaro', 'Debora Rasio', 'Cosimo De Nunzio', 'Gena M Hong', 'Marina Borro', 'Maurizio Simmaco']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Int J Mol Sci""","""['Lycopene as a chemopreventive agent in the treatment of high-grade prostate intraepithelial neoplasia.', 'Chemoprevention of prostate cancer in men with high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN): a systematic review and adjusted indirect treatment comparison.', 'A randomized double-blind placebo controlled phase I-II study on clinical and molecular effects of dietary supplements in men with precancerous prostatic lesions.

Experimental design:   Prostate cancer xenografts were examined to identify mechanism of progression after castration and abiraterone.  Results:   AR reactivation in abiraterone-resistant VCaP xenografts was not associated with restoration of intratumoral androgens or alterations in AR coregulators. In contrast, mRNA encoding full-length AR (AR-FL) and a constitutively active splice variant (AR-V7) were increased compared with xenografts before castration, with an increase in AR-V7 relative to AR-FL. This shift toward AR-V7 was due to a feedback mechanism whereby the androgen-liganded AR stimulates expression of proteins that suppress generation of AR-V7 relative to AR-FL transcripts. However, despite the increases in AR-V7 mRNA, it remained a minor transcript (<1%) relative to AR-FL in resistant VCaP xenografts and CRPC clinical samples. AR-V7 protein expression was similarly low relative to AR-FL in castration-resistant VCaP xenografts and androgen-deprived VCaP cells, but the weak basal AR activity in these latter cells was further repressed by AR-V7 siRNA.  Conclusions:   AR-V7 at these low levels is not adequate to restore AR activity, but its rapid induction after androgen deprivation allows tumors to retain basal AR activity that may be needed for survival until more potent mechanisms emerge to activate AR. Agents targeting AR splice variants may be most effective when used very early in conjunction with therapies targeting the AR ligand-binding domain.""","""['Ziyang Yu', 'Sen Chen', 'Adam G Sowalsky', 'Olga S Voznesensky', 'Elahe A Mostaghel', 'Peter S Nelson', 'Changmeng Cai', 'Steven P Balk']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Clin Cancer Res""","""['Words of wisdom.

However, limited information is available for composite on-line evaluation of these tools. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the dosimetric verification of IMAT treatment plans using a 2D diode array detector (2D array), radiochromic film (RCF) and radiosensitive polymer gel dosimeter (RPGD). The specific verification plans were created for IMAT for two prostate cancer patients by use of the clinical treatment plans. Accordingly, the IMAT deliveries were performed with the 2D array on a gantry-mounting device, RCF in a cylindrical acrylic phantom, and the RPGD in two cylindrical phantoms. After the irradiation, the planar dose distributions from the 2D array and the RCFs, and the 3D dose distributions from the RPGD measurements were compared with the calculated dose distributions using the gamma analysis method (3% dose difference and 3-mm distance-to-agreement criterion), dose-dependent dose difference diagrams, dose difference histograms, and isodose distributions. The gamma passing rates of 2D array, RCFs and RPGD for one patient were 99.5%, 96.5% and 93.7%, respectively; the corresponding values for the second patient were 97.5%, 92.6% and 92.9%. Mean percentage differences between the RPGD measured and calculated doses in 3D volumes containing PTVs were -0.29 ± 7.1% and 0.97 ± 7.6% for the two patients, respectively. In conclusion, IMAT prostate plans can be delivered with high accuracy, although the 3D measurements indicated less satisfactory agreement with the treatment plans, mainly due to the dosimetric inaccuracy in low-dose regions of the RPGD measurements.""","""['Naoki Hayashi', 'Ryan L Malmin', 'Yoichi Watanabe']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Radiat Res""","""['Experimental measurements and Monte Carlo simulations for dosimetric evaluations of intrafraction motion for gated and ungated intensity modulated arc therapy deliveries.', 'Feasibility study on dosimetry verification of volumetric-modulated arc therapy-based total marrow irradiation.', 'IMAT-SIM: a new method for the clinical dosimetry of intensity-modulated arc therapy (IMAT).', 'Clinical experience with EPID dosimetry for prostate IMRT pre-treatment dose verification.', 'Clinical implementation of intensity-modulated arc therapy.', 'Validation of a secondary dose check tool against Monte Carlo and analytical clinical dose calculation algorithms in VMAT.', 'Three-dimensional dose comparison of flattening filter (FF) and flattening filter-free (FFF) radiation therapy by using NIPAM gel dosimetry.', 'Patient-Specific Quality Assurance Protocol for Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy using Dose Volume Histogram.', 'Three-dimensional radiation dosimetry using polymer gel and solid radiochromic polymer: From basics to clinical applications.']"""

Model cell lines have been recently developed to study canine prostate cancer but their PSMA expression and enzymatic activity have not been elucidated. The present study was focused on determining PSMA expression in these model canine cell lines and the use of fluorescent small-molecule enzyme inhibitors to detect canine PSMA expression by flow cytometry.  Methods:   Western blot and RT-PCR were used to determine the transcriptional and translational expression of PSMA on the canine cell lines Leo and Ace-1. An endpoint HPLC-based assay was used to monitor the enzymatic activity of canine PSMA and the potency of enzyme inhibitors. Flow cytometry was used to detect the PSMA expressed on Leo and Ace-1 cells using a fluorescently tagged PSMA enzyme inhibitor.  Results:   Canine PSMA expression on the Leo cell line was confirmed by Western blot and RT-PCR, the enzyme activity, and flow cytometry. Kinetic parameters Km and Vmax of PSMA enzymatic activity for the synthetic substrate (PABGγG) were determined to be 393 nM and 220 pmol min(-1) mg protein(-1) , respectively. The inhibitor core 1 and fluorescent inhibitor 2 were found to be potent reversible inhibitors (IC50 = 13.2 and 1.6 nM, respectively) of PSMA expressed on the Leo cell line. Fluorescent labeling of Leo cells demonstrated that the fluorescent PSMA inhibitor 2 can be used for the detection of PSMA-positive canine prostate tumor cells. Expression of PSMA on Ace-1 was low and not detectable by flow cytometry.  Conclusions:   The results described herein have demonstrated that PSMA is expressed on canine prostate tumor cells and exhibits similar enzymatic characteristics as human PSMA. The findings show that the small molecule enzyme inhibitors currently being studied for use in diagnosis and therapy of human prostate cancer can also be extended to include canine prostate cancer. Importantly, the findings demonstrate that the potential of the inhibitors for use in diagnosis and therapy can be evaluated in an immunocompetent animal model that naturally develops prostate cancer before use in humans.""","""['Lisa Y Wu', 'Jacqueline M Johnson', 'Jessica K Simmons', 'Desiree E Mendes', 'Jonathan J Geruntho', 'Tiancheng Liu', 'Wessel P Dirksen', 'Thomas J Rosol', 'William C Davis', 'Clifford E Berkman']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Overexpression of prostate specific membrane antigen by canine hemangiosarcoma cells provides opportunity for the molecular detection of disease burdens within hemorrhagic body cavity effusions.', 'Cloning and characterization of canine prostate-specific membrane antigen.', 'Flow cytometric detection of prostate tumor cells using chemoaffinity labels.', 'Radiolabeled enzyme inhibitors and binding agents targeting PSMA: Effective theranostic tools for imaging and therapy of prostate cancer.', 'Current Status of Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen Targeting in Nuclear Medicine: Clinical Translation of Chelator Containing Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen Ligands Into Diagnostics and Therapy for Prostate Cancer.', 'Investigating PSMA differential expression in canine uroepithelial carcinomas to aid disease-based stratification and guide therapeutic selection.', 'An RNA-Seq-Based Framework for Characterizing Canine Prostate Cancer and Prioritizing Clinically Relevant Biomarker Candidate Genes.', 'Overexpression of prostate specific membrane antigen by canine hemangiosarcoma cells provides opportunity for the molecular detection of disease burdens within hemorrhagic body cavity effusions.', 'The therapeutic and diagnostic potential of the prostate specific membrane antigen/glutamate carboxypeptidase II (PSMA/GCPII) in cancer and neurological disease.', 'A human GRPr-transfected Ace-1 canine prostate cancer model in mice.']"""

FRK rs171866 remained as a significant predictor for disease progression; DAB2 rs268091 and EXOC4 rs1149558 remained as significant predictors for prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM); and EXOC4 rs1149558 remained as a significant predictor for all-cause mortality after ADT in multivariate models that included clinicopathologic predictors. In addition, the numbers of protective genotypes at DAB2 rs268091 and EXOC4 rs1149558 showed a cumulative effect on PCSM (P for trend = 0.002).

Six candidate master regulatory genes were identified, including GATA2, a gene encoding a pioneer factor, a special transcription factor facilitating the recruitment of additional transcription factors. Elevated GATA2 expression in metastatic prostate cancer tissues correlated with poor patient prognosis. Furthermore, GATA2 gene silencing in human prostate cancer LNCaP cells led to a marked reduction in cell migration, tissue invasion, focal adhesion disassembly and to a dramatic change in cell transcriptomes, indicating that GATA2 plays a critical role in prostate cancer metastasis.

The latter may be due to up-regulation of mouse double minute 2 homologue (MDM2), which functions both as an E3 ubiquitin ligase to degrade P53 protein via the proteasome and an inhibitor of P53 transcriptional activation. Zinc plays a crucial role in stabilizing the P53 DNA binding domain, but PCa cells often lack the ability to accumulate sufficient zinc. In the present study, we explore the optimal approach to retention of P53 function. To restore the defective P53 pathway in PCa, we have explored a combined treatment of Pmp53 [a plasmid containing both mdm2 small interfering RNA (Si-MDM2) and the wild-type p53 gene] with zinc. This treatment retains the wild-type P53 conformation and function in PCa in vitro and in vivo. Combined treatments significantly inhibited tumour xenograft growth, retaining wild-type P53 conformation and enhancing its transcriptional regulation of p21 and bax gene expression, leading to the decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis. These in vivo findings were confirmed by in vitro culture of PCa PC-3 (p53 null) or DU145 (mutant p53) cells and showed a positive effect of the combined therapy on cell cycle arrest and massive apoptosis. Our findings suggest that the combined therapy of Pmp53 with zinc is an effective strategy that may open a new therapeutic avenue in some cancers expressing low levels of zinc and a defective P53 status.""","""['Junlian Gu', 'Bo Wang', 'Yanan Liu', 'Lingzhi Zhong', 'Yufeng Tang', 'Hua Guo', 'Tao Jiang', 'Liwei Wang', 'Yang Li', 'Lu Cai']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Eur J Cancer""","""['Synergistic suppression of prostatic cancer cells by coexpression of both murine double minute 2 small interfering RNA and wild-type p53 gene in vitro and in vivo.', 'A novel apoptotic mechanism of genetically engineered adenovirus-mediated tumour-specific p53 overexpression through E1A-dependent p21 and MDM2 suppression.', 'MicroRNA-340 inhibits prostate cancer cell proliferation and metastasis by targeting the MDM2-p53 pathway.', 'The regulation of MDM2 oncogene and its impact on human cancers.', 'Chemosensitization by antisense oligonucleotides targeting MDM2.', 'Advances of Zinc Signaling Studies in Prostate Cancer.', 'Study on the cellular internalization mechanisms and in\xa0vivo anti-bone metastasis prostate cancer efficiency of the peptide T7-modified polypeptide nanoparticles.', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 21 Attenuates Diabetes-Induced Renal Fibrosis by Negatively Regulating TGF-β-p53-Smad2/3-Mediated Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition via Activation of AKT.', 'Zinc cooperates with p53 to inhibit the activity of mitochondrial aconitase through reactive oxygen species accumulation.', 'Design of indole- and MCR-based macrocycles as p53-MDM2 antagonists.']"""

To begin to address this issue, we developed a novel tumorigenesis model by reducing the expression of multiple selenoproteins (SPs) in mouse prostatic epithelium. This was accomplished via the prostate-specific deletion of Trsp, a gene that encodes a transfer RNA (Sec tRNA) required for the insertion of selenocysteine residues into SPs during their translation. By 6 weeks of age, Trsp-deficient mice exhibited widespread prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia lesions in all prostatic lobes, which then progressed to high-grade dysplasia and microinvasive carcinoma by 24 weeks. In contrast to other murine prostate cancer models, Trsp-deficient mice required neither the deletion of a tumor suppressor nor the transgenic introduction of an oncogene for prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia lesion development. In keeping with the antioxidant functions of several SPs, we found increases in lipid peroxidation markers in Trsp-deficient epithelial cells.

Immobilization systems and their corresponding set-up errors influence the clinical target volume to planning target volume (CTV-PTV) margins and thus may result in undesirable treatment outcomes. This study compared the reproducibility of patient positioning with Hipfix system and whole body alpha cradle with respect to localized prostate cancer and investigated the existing CTV-PTV margins in the clinical oncology departments of two hospitals.  Methods:   Forty sets of data of patients with localized T1-T3 prostate cancer were randomly selected from two regional hospitals, with 20 patients immobilized by a whole-body alpha cradle system and 20 by a thermoplastic Hipfix system. Seven sets of the anterior-posterior (AP), cranial-caudal (CC) and medial-lateral (ML) deviations were collected from each patient. The reproducibility of patient positioning within the two hospitals was compared using a total vector error (TVE) parameter. In addition, CTV-PTV margins were computed using van Herk's formula. The resulting values were compared to the current CTV-PTV margins in both hospitals.  Results:   The TVE values were 5.1 and 2.8 mm for the Hipfix and the whole-body alpha cradle systems respectively. TVE associated with the whole-body alpha cradle system was found to be significantly less than the Hipfix system (p < 0.05). The CC axis in the Hipfix system attained the highest frequency of large (23.6%) and serious (7.9%) set-up errors. The calculated CTV to PTV margin was 8.3, 1.9 and 2.3 mm for the Hipfix system, and 2.1, 3.4 and 1.8 mm for the whole body alpha cradle in CC, ML and AP axes respectively. All but one (CC axis using Hipfix) margin calculated did not exceed the corresponding hospital protocol. The whole body alpha cradle system was found to be significantly better than the Hipfix system in terms of reproducibility (p < 0.05), especially in the CC axis.  Conclusions:   The whole body alpha cradle system was more reproducible than the Hipfix system. In particular, the difference in CC axis contributed most to the results and the current CC margin for the Hipfix system might be considered as inadequate.""","""['Peter White', 'Chui Ka Yee', 'Lee Chi Shan', 'Lee Wai Chung', 'Ng Ho Man', 'Yik Shing Cheung']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Radiat Oncol""","""['A prospective comparison of three systems of patient immobilization for prostate radiotherapy.', 'Set-up error in supine-positioned patients immobilized with two different modalities during conformal radiotherapy of prostate cancer.', 'Evaluation of dosimetric margins in prostate IMRT treatment plans.', 'Patient positioning using in-room kV CT for image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT) of prostate cancer.', 'IMRT for prostate cancer: defining target volume based on correlated pathologic volume of disease.', 'Development and results of a patient-reported treatment experience questionnaire on a 1.5\xa0T MR-Linac.', ""Development and psychometric testing of an instrument to measure the patient's experience of external radiotherapy: The Radiotherapy Experience Questionnaire (RTEQ)."", 'Couch modeling optimization for tomotherapy planning and delivery.', 'A Noninvasive Method to Reduce Radiotherapy Positioning Error Caused by Respiration for Patients With Abdominal or Pelvic Cancers.', 'Immobilization versus no immobilization for pelvic external beam radiotherapy.']"""

Patients and methods:   The study included 199 consecutive patients with biopsy confirmed prostate cancer randomised to MRI before radical prostatectomy from December 2009 to July 2012. MRI-detected tumours (MRTs) were ranked from 1 to 3 according to decreasing volume and were compared with histologically detected tumours (HTs) ranked from 1 to 3, with HT 1 = index tumour. Whole-mount section histology was used as a reference standard. The TVs of true-positive MRTs (MRTVs 1-3) were compared with the TVs found by histology (HTVs 1-3). All tumours were registered on a 30-sector map and by classifying each sector as positive/negative, the rate of true-positive and -negative sectors was calculated.  Results:   The detection rate for the HT 1 (index tumour) was 92%; HT 2, 45%; and HT 3, 37%.

Methods:   PCA-1-siRNA and control siRNA were transfected into LNCaP cells with lipofectamine 2000. The cell cycle, proliferation and migration were determined by methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay, flow cytometry and Transwell chambers, respectively. Western blotting was used to detect the expression of cyclin E, matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP-9) and p21. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect the expression of PCA-1 protein in 126 cases of prostate cancer and 88 cases of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).

The hydrogels were synthesized using chemically modified hyaluronic acid (HA) carrying acrylate groups (HA-AC) or reactive thiols (HA-SH). The crosslinked hydrogel networks exhibited an estimated pore size of 70-100 nm, similar to the spacing of the extracellular matrices (ECM) surrounding tumor tissues. LNCaP PCa cells entrapped in the HA matrices formed distinct tumor-like multicellular aggregates with an average diameter of 50 μm after 7 days of culture. Compared to cells grown on two-dimensional (2D) tissue culture plates, cells from the engineered tumoroids expressed significantly higher levels of multidrug resistance (MDR) proteins, including multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP1) and lung resistance-related protein (LRP), both at the mRNA and the protein levels. Separately, Dox-NPs with an average diameter of 54 ± 1 nm were prepared from amphiphilic block copolymers based on poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) bearing pendant cyclic ketals. Dox-NPs were able to diffuse through the hydrogel matrices, penetrate into the tumoroid and be internalized by LNCaP PCa cells through caveolae-mediated endocytosis and macropinocytosis pathways. Compared to 2D cultures, LNCaP PCa cells cultured as multicellular aggregates in HA hydrogel were more resistant to Dox and Dox-NPs treatments. Moreover, the NP-based Dox formulation could bypass the drug efflux function of MRP1, thereby partially reversing the resistance to free Dox in 3D cultures.

The technology relies on hybridization of genomic fragments to probes on the chip. However, certain genomic factors may compromise the ability to measure methylation using the array such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), small insertions and deletions (INDELs), repetitive DNA, and regions with reduced genomic complexity. Currently, there is no clear method or pipeline for determining which of the probes on the HM450K bead array should be retained for subsequent analysis in light of these issues.  Results:   We comprehensively assessed the effects of SNPs, INDELs, repeats and bisulfite induced reduced genomic complexity by comparing HM450K bead array results with whole genome bisulfite sequencing.

Patients and methods:   Between 1997 and 2010, 870 consecutive patients with intermediate-risk prostate cancer were treated at our institution with either 86.4 Gy of IMRT alone (n = 470) or combo-RT consisting of brachytherapy combined with 50.4 Gy of IMRT (n = 400). Brachytherapy consisted of low-dose-rate permanent interstitial implantation in 260 patients and high-dose-rate temporary implantation in 140 patients. The median (range) follow-up for the entire cohort was 5.3 (1-14) years.  Results:   For IMRT alone vs combo-RT, 7-year actuarial prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-relapse-free survival (PSA-RFS) rates were 81.4 vs 92.0% (P < 0.001), and distant metastases-free survival (DMFS) rates were 93.0 vs 97.2% (P = 0.04), respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that combo-RT was associated with better PSA-RFS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.40 [95% confidence interval, 0.24-0.66], P < 0.001), and better DMFS (HR, 0.41 [0.18-0.92], P = 0.03). A higher incidence of acute genitourinary (GU) grade 2 (35.8 vs 18.9%; P < 0.01) and acute GU grade 3 (2.3 vs 0.4%; P = 0.03) toxicities occurred in the combo-RT group than in the IMRT-alone group. Most acute toxicity resolved. Late toxicity outcomes were similar between the treatment groups. The 7-year actuarial late toxicity rates for grade 2 gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity were 4.6 vs 4.1% (P = 0.89), for grade 3 GI toxicity 0.4 vs 1.4% (P = 0.36), for grade 2 GU toxicity 19.4 vs 21.2% (P = 0.14), and grade 3 GU toxicity 3.1 vs 1.4% (P = 0.74) for the IMRT vs the combo-RT group, respectively.  Conclusions:   Enhanced dose escalation using combo-RT was associated with superior PSA-RFS and DMFS outcomes for patients with intermediate-risk prostate cancer compared with high-dose IMRT alone at a dose of 86.4 Gy. While acute GU toxicities were more prevalent in the combo-RT group, the incidence of late GI and GU toxicities was similar between the treatment groups.""","""['Daniel E Spratt', 'Zachary S Zumsteg', 'Pirus Ghadjar', 'Marisa A Kollmeier', 'Xin Pei', 'Gilad Cohen', 'William Polkinghorn', 'Yoshiya Yamada', 'Michael J Zelefsky']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Radiation dose escalation for localized prostate cancer: intensity-modulated radiotherapy versus permanent transperineal brachytherapy.', 'Comparing morbidity and cancer control after 3D-conformal (70/74 Gy) and intensity modulated radiotherapy (78/82 Gy) for prostate cancer.', 'External beam radiation therapy with or without low-dose-rate brachytherapy: Analysis of favorable and unfavorable intermediate-risk prostate cancer patients.', 'Intensity-modulated radiotherapy for the treatment of prostate cancer: a systematic review and economic evaluation.', 'Late toxicity rates following definitive radiotherapy for prostate cancer.', 'Toxicity of dose-escalated radiotherapy up to 84\xa0Gy for prostate cancer.', 'Determining Combined Modality Dosimetric Constraints by Integration of IMRT and LDR Prostate Brachytherapy Dosimetry and Correlation with Toxicity.', 'A Contemporary Report of Low-Dose-Rate Brachytherapy for Prostate Cancer Using MRI for Risk Stratification: Disease Outcomes and Patient-Reported Quality of Life.', 'Real-world utilisation of brachytherapy boost and patient-reported functional outcomes in men who had external beam radiation therapy for prostate cancer in Australia.', 'Role of Brachytherapy Boost in Clinically Localized Intermediate and High-Risk Prostate Cancer: Lack of Benefit in Patients with Very High-Risk Factors T3b-4 and/or Gleason 9-10.']"""

In contrast to our previous finding in human prostate cancer LNCaP cells having a lack of P53 activation by MSeA, induction of G2 arrest in PANC-1 cells was accompanied by increased mutant P53 Ser15 phosphorylation, upregulation of P53-targets P21Cip1 and GADD45 and G2 checkpoint kinase (Chk2) activation, suggestive of DNA damage responses. A rapid inhibition of AKT phosphorylation was followed by reduced mTOR signaling and increased autophagy in PANC-1 cells attenuating caspase-mediated apoptosis execution. Furthermore, daily oral treatment with MSeA (3 mg Se/kg body weight) significantly suppressed growth of subcutaneously inoculated PANC-1 xenograft in SCID mice. Immunohistochemical analyses detected increased p-Ser15 P53, P21Cip1, pS139-H2AX (DNA damage responses), and caspase-3 cleavage and decreased pSer473AKT and Ki67 proliferative index and reduced intratumor vascular density in MSeA-treated xenograft.

The transducer is designed as a drop-in probe with a flexible cord for insertion through a laparoscopic port, and is controlled by a robotic arm with the ultrasonographic image shown as a console Tile-pro display. Intraoperative localization of the biopsy-proven cancerous hypoechoic lesion was feasible in four out of four cases. The microtransducer facilitated identification of the bladder neck as well as the appropriate level of neurovascular bundle release. Negative surgical margin was achieved in all 10 cases (100%), even though five of 10 patients (50%) had extraprostatic (pT3) disease. Recovery of erectile function and continence was encouraging.

The essential autophagy gene ATG6/BECN1 encoding the Beclin1 protein has been implicated as a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor in breast, ovarian, and prostate cancers. The proximity of BECN1 to the known breast and ovarian tumor suppressor breast cancer 1, early onset, BRCA1, on chromosome 17q21, has made this determination equivocal. Here, the mutational status of BECN1 was assessed in human tumor sequencing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and other databases. Large deletions encompassing both BRCA1 and BECN1, and deletions of only BRCA1 but not BECN1, were found in breast and ovarian cancers, consistent with BRCA1 loss being a primary driver mutation in these cancers. Furthermore, there was no evidence for BECN1 mutation or loss in any other cancer, casting doubt on whether BECN1 is a tumor suppressor in most human cancers.  Implications:   Contrary to previous reports, BECN1 is not significantly mutated in human cancer and not a tumor-suppressor gene, as originally thought.

RANK-mediated signaling established a premetastatic niche through a feed-forward loop, involving the induction of RANKL and c-Met, but repression of androgen receptor (AR) expression and AR signaling pathways. Site-directed mutagenesis and transcription factor (TF) deletion/interference assays identified common TF complexes, c-Myc/Max, and AP4 as critical regulatory nodes. RANKL-RANK signaling activated a number of master regulator TFs that control the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (Twist1, Slug, Zeb1, and Zeb2), stem cell properties (Sox2, Myc, Oct3/4, and Nanog), neuroendocrine differentiation (Sox9, HIF1α, and FoxA2), and osteomimicry (c-Myc/Max, Sox2, Sox9, HIF1α, and Runx2). Abrogating RANK or its downstream c-Myc/Max or c-Met signaling network minimized or abolished skeletal metastasis in mice. RANKL-expressing LNCaP cells recruited and induced neighboring non metastatic LNCaP cells to express RANKL, c-Met/activated c-Met, while downregulating AR expression. These initially non-metastatic cells, once retrieved from the tumors, acquired the potential to colonize and grow in bone.

Methods:   A total of 35,427 Hispanic men diagnosed with invasive prostate cancer from 1995 through 2008 in the California Cancer Registry were studied; vital status data were available through 2010. Block group-level neighborhood measures were developed from US Census data. Stage-stratified Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the effect of nativity and ethnic enclave on prostate cancer survival.  Results:   In models adjusted for neighborhood socioeconomic status and other individual factors, foreign-born Hispanics were found to have a significantly lower risk of prostate cancer survival (hazards ratio [HR], 0.81; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.75-0.87).

Aberrant expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) has been associated with the pathogenesis of various cancers, including PCa. Circulatory forms of miRNAs have been detected in serum and hold promise as minimally invasive cancer biomarkers. This study aimed to identify potential circulatory miRNAs that can provide insights into new mechanisms for clinical diagnosis of PCa and can serve as potential biomarkers and/or therapeutic targets. Candidate serum miRNAs were detected by using PCR microarray in a learning set of six African American (AA) and six Caucasian American (CA) PCa patients. Discriminating performance of candidate miRNAs was validated by qRT-PCR in serum samples from 36 AA (24 PCa patients and 12 controls) and 36 CA (16 PCa patients and 20 controls). From the miRNA profiling experiments, three differentially expressed miRNAs (miR-25, miR-101, and miR-628-5p) were selected for future validation.

We evaluated the long-term results of radical prostatectomy and immediate adjuvant androgen deprivation therapy in Japanese patients with pT3N0M0 prostate cancer.  Methods:   We retrospectively reviewed 128 patients with pT3N0M0 prostate cancer who underwent radical prostatectomy at our institute from 2000 to 2006. All pT3N0 patients were treated with adjuvant androgen deprivation therapy shortly after radical prostatectomy. Immediate adjuvant androgen deprivation therapy was continued for at least 5 years. Twenty-three were excluded because of preoperative hormonal therapy, missing data, or others. Death from any cause, death from prostate cancer, clinical recurrence and hormone-refractory biochemical progression were analyzed by Kaplan-Meier graphs. Relative risks of progression were estimated using Cox proportional hazards models with 95% confidence intervals.  Results:   The 10-year hormone-refractory biochemical progression-free survival rate was 88.3% and the cancer-specific survival rate was 96.3% after a median follow-up period of 8.2 years (range 25.6-155.6 months).

Multivariate analyses identified Gleason score at biopsy (p = 0.027) and seminal vesicle invasion (p = 0.030) as independent prognostic factors for hormone-refractory biochemical progression. None of the patients with clinical T1 cancers (n = 20), negative surgical margin (n = 12), or negative perineural invasion (n = 11) experienced hormone-refractory biochemical progression.

Computed tomography, bone scintigraphy, and magnetic resonance imaging showed systemic lymph node and osteoblastic bone metastases. Digital rectal examination revealed a small, soft prostate without nodules. Ten-core transrectal prostate biopsy yielded negative results. Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) was started because of the patient's severe symptoms. Twelve-core repeat transrectal prostate biopsy performed 2 months later, and transurethral resection biopsy performed 5 months later, both yielded negative results. The patient refused further cancer screening because ADT effectively relieved his symptoms.

We, therefore, investigated the density of infiltrating B cells within human PCa utilizing a quantitative computational method.  Methods:   Archived radical prostatectomy specimens from 53 patients with known clinical outcome and D'Amico risk category were obtained and immunohistochemically (IHC) stained for the B cell marker, CD20. Slides were reviewed by a genitourinary pathologist who manually delineated the tumoral regions of PCa. Slides were digitally scanned and a computer algorithm quantified the area of CD20 stained B-cells as a measure of B cell density within the outlined regions of prostate cancer (intra-tumoral region), versus extra-tumoral prostate tissue. Correlations were analyzed between B-cell density and demographic and clinical variables, including D'Amico risk groups and disease recurrence.  Results:   For the entire cohort, the mean intra-tumoral B cell density was higher (3.22 SE = 0.29) than in the extra-tumoral region of each prostatectomy section (2.24, SE = 0.19) (paired t test; P < 0.001). When analyzed according to D'Amico risk group, the intra-tumoral B cell infiltration in low risk (0.0377 vs. 0.0246; p = 0.151) and intermediate risk (0.0260 vs. 0.0214; p = 0.579) patient prostatectomy specimens did not show significantly more B-cells within the PCa tumor. However, patient specimens from the high-risk group (0.0301 vs. 0.0197; p < 0.001) and from those who eventually had PCa recurrence or progression (0.0343 vs. 0.0246; p = 0.019) did show significantly more intra-tumoral CD20+ B-cell staining. Extent of B-cell infiltration in the prostatectomy specimens did not correlate with any other clinical parameters.  Conclusions:   Our study shows that higher B-cell infiltration was present within the intra-tumoral PCa regions compared to the extra-tumoral benign prostate tissue regions in prostatectomy sections. For this study we developed a new method to measure B-cells using computer-assisted digitized image analysis. Accurate, consistent quantitation of B-cells in prostatectomy specimens is essential for future clinical trials evaluating the effect of B cell ablating antibodies.

Design:   All of relevant studies were identified by searching PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science, and were assessed by further quality evaluation. Pooled hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of total and stratified analyses, for overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS), were calculated to investigate the association between high miR-221 expression and cancer prognosis.  Results:   We found that high miR-221 expression can predict a poor OS in malignant tumors (pooled HR = 1.55, P = 0.017) but has no significant association with RFS (pooled HR = 1.02, P = 0.942). Further in stratified analyses, high miR-221 expression was significantly associated with a poor OS in Asians (pooled HR = 2.04, P = 0.010) or serum/ plasma subgroup (pooled HR = 2.28, P<0.001), and even showed significantly poor OS (pooled HR = 1.80, P<0.001) and RFS (pooled HR = 2.43, P = 0.010) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) subgroup, but was correlated to a favorable RFS in prostate cancer subgroup (pooled HR = 0.51, P = 0.004).  Conclusions:   Our findings demonstrate that miR-221 is more suitable to predict cancer prognosis in Asians, and it is a promising prognostic biomarker for HCC.

Even when cisplatin treatment is successful the patient is often left with a residual teratoma at the site of the primary tumor suggesting that cisplatin may trigger differentiation in some tumors. Using the human embryonal carcinoma cell line NTera2/D1, we confirmed that exposure to the differentiating agent retinoic acid produced a reduction in pluripotency markers NANOG and POU5F1 (Oct3/4) and an acute concentration-dependent increase in resistance to both cisplatin and paclitaxel that reached as high as 18-fold for cisplatin and 61-fold for paclitaxel within four days. A two day exposure to cisplatin also produced a concentration-dependent decrease in the expression of the NANOG and POU5F1 and increased expression of three markers whose levels increase with differentiation including Nestin, SCG10 and Fibronectin. In parallel, exposure to cisplatin induced up to 6.2-fold resistance to itself and 104-fold resistance to paclitaxel. Paclitaxel did not induce differentiation or resistance to either itself or cisplatin. Neither retinoic acid nor cisplatin induced resistance in cervical or prostate cancer cell lines or other germ cell tumor lines in which they failed to alter the expression of NANOG and POU5F1. Forced expression of NANOG prevented the induction of resistance to cisplatin by retinoic acid.

The use of potential cardenolide glycosides may be a worthwhile approach in anticancer research. Reevesioside A, a cardenolide glycoside isolated from the root of Reevesia formosana, displayed potent anti-proliferative activity against human hormone-refractory prostate cancers. A good correlation (r² = 0.98) between the expression of Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase α₃ subunit and anti-proliferative activity suggested the critical role of the α₃ subunit. Reevesioside A induced G1 arrest of the cell cycle and subsequent apoptosis in a thymidine block-mediated synchronization model. The data were supported by the down-regulation of several related cell cycle regulators, including cyclin D1, cyclin E and CDC25A. Reevesioside A also caused a profound decrease of RB phosphorylation, leading to an increased association between RB and E2F1 and the subsequent suppression of E2F1 activity. The protein and mRNA levels of c-myc, which can activate expression of many downstream cell cycle regulators, were dramatically inhibited by reevesioside A. Transient transfection of c-myc inhibited the down-regulation of both cyclin D1 and cyclin E protein expression to reevesioside A action, suggesting that c-myc functioned as an upstream regulator. Flow cytometric analysis of JC-1 staining demonstrated that reevesioside A also induced the significant loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. In summary, the data suggest that reevesioside A inhibits c-myc expression and down-regulates the expression of CDC25A, cyclin D1 and cyclin E, leading to a profound decrease of RB phosphorylation. G1 arrest is, therefore, induced through E2F1 suppression.

Our results showed ectopic expression of RUNX3 in prostate cancer tissues when compared with tumor adjacent normal prostate tissues, and reduced RUNX3 staining was significantly correlated with TNM stage. Moreover, we demonstrated that RUNX3 overexpression inhibited prostate cancer cell migration and invasion resulting from the elevated upregulation of tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (TIMP-2), which subsequently inhibited metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) expression and activity in vitro. Knock down of RUNX3 expression broke up the balance of TIMP-2/MMP-2, whereas silence of TIMP-2 resulted in the inhibition of MMP-2 expression in prostate cells. We also showed that restoration of RUNX3 decreased vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secretion and suppressed endothelial cell growth and tube formation. Strikingly, RUNX3 was demonstrated to inhibit tumor metastasis and angiogenesis in vivo. Altogether, our results support the tumor suppressive role of RUNX3 in human prostate cancer, and provide insights into development of targeted therapy for this disease.""","""['Feifei Chen', 'Meng Wang', 'Jin Bai', 'Qinghua Liu', 'Yaguang Xi', 'Wang Li', 'Junnian Zheng']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['RUNX3 suppresses migration, invasion and angiogenesis of human renal cell carcinoma.', 'RUNX3 inhibits the metastasis and angiogenesis of colorectal cancer.', 'SPAG9 expression is increased in human prostate cancer and promotes cell motility, invasion and angiogenesis in vitro.', 'RUNX3 inhibits glioma survival and invasion via suppression of the β-catenin/TCF-4 signaling pathway.', 'p53 Deficiency-Dependent Oncogenicity of Runx3.', 'RUNX3 Transcript Variants Have Distinct Roles in Ovarian Carcinoma and Differently Influence Platinum Sensitivity and Angiogenesis.', 'Circulating prostate cancer cells have differential resistance to fluid shear stress-induced cell death.', 'MicroRNAs in treatment-induced neuroendocrine differentiation in prostate cancer.', 'Gene expression analysis of human prostate cell lines with and without tumor metastasis suppressor CD82.', 'Long Noncoding RNA (lncRNA) MT1JP Suppresses Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) in vitro.']"""

We investigated primary tumors of 437 patients diagnosed between 1989 and 2006 by Sanger sequencing. Mutations were detected in 38.7% of patients and were associated with age, histological subtype as well as mitotic rate. The mutational rate was 36.7% in patients with disease-free course and 51.7% in those with subsequent distant metastasis (p = 0.031). No difference in overall survival (p = 0.119) but a trend for worse distant-metastasis-free survival (p = 0.061) was observed in BRAF mutant compared to BRAF wild-type patients. Independent prognostic factors for overall survival were tumor thickness, mitotic rate and ulceration. An interesting significant prognostic impact was observed in patients with tumor thickness of 1 mm or less, with the mutation present in 6 of 7 patients dying from melanoma. In conclusion, no significant survival differences were found according to BRAF-V600 tumor mutations in patients with primary melanoma but an increasing impact of the mutational status was observed in the subgroup of patients with tumor thickness of 1 mm or less.

The three-step analgesic ladder framework of the World Health Organisation (WHO) provides no guidance on multiple opioid prescribing and there is little epidemiological data available to inform practice. This study aims to investigate the time trend of such cases and the associated factors.  Methods:   Strong opioid prescribing in the last three months of life of cancer patients were extracted from the General Practice Research Database (GPRD). The outcome variable was the number of different types of prescribed non-rescue doses of opioids (1 vs 2-4, referred to as a complex case). Associated factors were evaluated using prevalence ratios (PR) derived from multivariate log-binomial model, adjusting for clustering effects and potential confounding variables.  Results:   Overall, 26.4% (95% CI: 25.6-27.1%) of 13,427 cancer patients (lung 41.7%, colorectal 19.1%, breast 18.6%, prostate 15.5%, head and neck 5.0%) were complex cases. Complex cases increased steadily over the study period (1.02% annually, 95%CI: 0.42-1.61%, p = 0.048) but with a small dip (7.5% reduction, 95%CI: -0.03 to 17.8%) around the period of the Shipman case, a British primary care doctor who murdered his patients with opioids. The dip significantly affected the correlation of the complex cases with persistent increasing background opioid prescribing (weighted correlation coefficients pre-, post-Shipman periods: 0.98(95%CI: 0.67-1.00), p = 0.011; 0.14 (95%CI: -0.85 to 0.91), p = 0.85). Multivariate adjusted analysis showed that the complex cases were predominantly associated with year of death (PRs vs 2000: 1.05-1.65), not other demographic and clinical factors except colorectal cancer (PR vs lung cancer: 1.24, 95%CI: 1.12-1.37).  Conclusion:   These findings suggest that prescribing behaviour, rather than patient factors, plays an important role in multiple opioid prescribing at the end of life; highlighting the need for training and education that goes beyond the well-recognised WHO approach for clinical practitioners.""","""['Wei Gao', 'Martin Gulliford', 'Michael I Bennett', 'Fliss E M Murtagh', 'Irene J Higginson']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Opioid prescribing for cancer pain during the last 3 months of life: associated factors and 9-year trends in a nationwide United Kingdom cohort study.', 'Cohort protocol paper: the Pain and Opioids In Treatment (POINT) study.', 'Opioid prescribing for chronic musculoskeletal pain in UK primary care: results from a cohort analysis of the COPERS trial.', 'Patterns of regional variation of opioid prescribing in primary care in England: a retrospective observational study.', 'Time trends and prescribing patterns of opioid drugs in UK primary care patients with non-cancer pain: A retrospective cohort study.', 'Opioid Use at End-Of-Life Among Nova Scotia Patients With Cancer.', 'Opioid safety recommendations in adult palliative medicine: a North American Delphi expert consensus.', 'High-Intensity End-of-Life Care Among Patients With GI Cancer in Puerto Rico: A Population-Based Study.', 'Cognition and Sociodemographic Determinants for Effective Pain Control in Patients with Cancer Pain: a Cross-sectional Survey in China.', 'Colorectal cancer.']"""

We investigated whether there were urban-rural variations in the incidence of 18 cancers, after adjusting for socioeconomic status. Cancers diagnosed between 1995 and 2007 were extracted from the population-based National Cancer Registry Ireland and Northern Ireland Cancer Registry and categorised by urban-rural status, based on population density of area of residence at diagnosis (rural <1 person per hectare, intermediate 1-15 people per hectare, urban >15 people per hectare). Relative risks (RR) were calculated by negative binomial regression, adjusting for age, country and three area-based markers of socioeconomic status. Risks were significantly higher in both sexes in urban than rural residents with head and neck (males RR urban vs. rural = 1.53, 95 % CI 1.42-1.64; females RR = 1.29, 95 % CI 1.15-1.45), esophageal (males 1.21, 1.11-1.31; females 1.21, 1.08-1.35), stomach (males 1.36, 1.27-1.46; females 1.19, 1.08-1.30), colorectal (males 1.14, 1.09-1.18; females 1.04, 1.00-1.09), lung (males 1.54, 1.47-1.61; females 1.74, 1.65-1.84), non-melanoma skin (males 1.13, 1.10-1.17; females 1.23, 1.19-1.27) and bladder (males 1.30, 1.21-1.39; females 1.31, 1.17-1.46) cancers. Risks of breast, cervical, kidney and brain cancer were significantly higher in females in urban areas. Prostate cancer risk was higher in rural areas (0.94, 0.90-0.97). Other cancers showed no significant urban-rural differences. After adjusting for socioeconomic variation, urban-rural differences were evident for 12 of 18 cancers.

Aim of the study is to evaluate the outcome of radical prostatectomy in case of specimen-confined (SC) disease and to compare it with patients with pathological locally-advanced disease.  Materials and methods:   Data from 176 consecutive patients with high-risk prostate cancer who underwent RP as initial therapy were analyzed, identifying subjects with specimen-confined disease (i.e. negative margins and negative lymph-nodes) in which RP was considered as monotherapy, and comparing oncological outcomes to patients with pathological non-SC disease, in which RP was considered as the first step of a multimodal approach.  Results:   In high-risk prostate cancer, pathological report showed the presence of specimen-confined disease in 28.3% of cases. At univariate analysis, age and PSA correlate with the presence of SC disease at radical prostatectomy, while at multivariate analysis only PSA was a significant predictor of SC disease. At 5 years, Kaplan-Meier estimation of biochemical-free and cancer-specific survival was 56.2% and 97.7% vs 40.8% and 92.8% in specimen-confined disease and non-specimen-confined disease, respectively.  Conclusions:   High-risk prostate cancer presents challenges for uro-oncologists since standard treatment is still under debate.

Methods:   From December 2009 to May 2010, three patients underwent salvage BT due to local recurrences of high risk PCa after extrafascial RRP without additional adjuvant therapies. Local recurrence was confirmed by prostate biopsy and the relapse was well defined by endorectal ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging. Metastatic screening was negative. The patients were followed-up according to the American Brachytherapy Society guidelines.  Results:   The median dose delivered to 90% of the local relapse (D90) was 115 Gy. The three patients reached a prostate specific antigen (PSA) nadir value within the first year that remained stable at a mean follow-up of 32 months. As regards morbidity, moderate de novo urgency was reported by only one patient.  Conclusions:   We think that our data confirms the feasibility and safety of salvage BT as a possible alternative option to external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) for the treatment of locally recurrent PCa in selected patients when performed by experienced centers.

However, although mutations in DSB repair proteins are common in hereditary cancers, mechanisms of impaired DSB repair in sporadic cancers remain incompletely understood. Here, we describe the first role for a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) in DSB repair in prostate cancer. We identify PCAT-1, a prostate cancer outlier lncRNA, which regulates cell response to genotoxic stress.

Since the dose received from pre-treatment imaging can be significant, the incorporation of this dose at the planning stage of treatment has been suggested.  Methods:   The impact of imaging dose incorporation on cell survival was investigated by clonogenic assay of irradiated DU-145 prostate cancer, H460 non-small-cell lung cancer and AGO-1522b normal tissue fibroblast cells. Clinically relevant imaging-to-treatment times of 7.5 and 15 min were chosen for this study. The theoretical magnitude of the loss of radiobiological efficacy due to sublethal damage repair was investigated using the Lea-Catcheside dose protraction factor model.  Results:   For the cell lines investigated, the experimental data showed that imaging dose incorporation had no significant impact on cell survival. These findings were in close agreement with theoretical results.  Conclusion:   For the conditions investigated, the results suggest that allowance for the imaging dose at the planning stage of treatment should not adversely affect treatment efficacy.  Advances in knowledge:   There is a paucity of data in the literature on imaging effects in radiotherapy. This article presents a systematic study of imaging dose effects on cancer and normal cell survival, providing both theoretical and experimental evidence for clinically relevant imaging doses and imaging-to-treatment times.

CTCE-9908 is a known inhibitor of CXCR4. Herein, we tested the efficacy of CTCE-9908 in inhibiting prostate cancer cell growth, invasion, and metastasis.  Methods:   We used a panel of in vitro assays utilizing human prostate cancer cell lines and an in vivo orthotopic prostate cancer model to assess the anti-tumoral activity of CTCE-9908.  Results:   We demonstrated that (a) CTCE-9908 treatment resulted in no significant change in the growth of PC-3 and C4-2B cells; (b) 50 μg/ml of CTCE-9908 inhibited the invasive properties of PC-3 cells; (c) 25 mg/kg of CTCE-9908 did not alter primary tumor growth but it did significantly reduce total tumor burden in the animal including the growth of prostate and soft tissue metastases to lymph node and distant organ tissues. Histological analysis showed that CTCE-9908 treatment resulted in tumor necrosis in primary prostate tumors and no significant change in proliferation of tumor cells as measured by Ki-67 staining; (d) CTCE-9908 inhibited the tumor angiogenesis as measured by CD34 positive vessels in tumors.  Conclusions:   These data suggest that CXCR4 inhibition by CTCE-9908 decreases the invasion potential in vitro, which then translated to a reduction of tumor spread with associated reduction in angiogenesis. Hence, CTCE-9908 may prove to be an efficacious novel agent to prevent and treat the spread of metastatic prostate cancer.""","""['Donald Wong', 'Pridvi Kandagatla', 'Walter Korz', 'Sreenivasa R Chinni']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""BMC Urol""","""['A CXCR4 antagonist CTCE-9908 inhibits primary tumor growth and metastasis of breast cancer.', 'Effects of CXCR4 antagonist CTCE-9908 on prostate tumor growth.', 'Effective inhibition of metastases and primary tumor growth with CTCE-9908 in esophageal cancer.', 'The association of CXCR4 expression with clinicopathological significance and potential drug target in prostate cancer: a meta-analysis and literature review.', 'The involvement of a chemokine receptor antagonist CTCE-9908 and kynurenine metabolites in cancer development.', 'CXCR4-Targeted Necrosis-Inducing Peptidomimetic for Treating Breast Cancer.', 'CXCR7 as a novel therapeutic target for advanced prostate cancer.', 'Therapeutic Perspectives of HIV-Associated Chemokine Receptor (CCR5 and CXCR4) Antagonists in Carcinomas.', 'CircSMARCC1 facilitates tumor progression by disrupting the crosstalk between prostate cancer cells and tumor-associated macrophages via miR-1322/CCL20/CCR6 signaling.', 'Recent Advances in CXCL12/CXCR4 Antagonists and Nano-Based Drug Delivery Systems for Cancer Therapy.']"""

Patients and methods:   A total of 360 men from two Italian institutions who had undergone at least two PCA3 assessments were selected. Of these, 97.5% were scheduled for first or repeat prostate biopsy because of elevated PSA level and/or positive digital rectal examination (DRE). We compared the PCA3 scores in men with a negative biopsy (normal parenchyma, benign prostatic hyperplasia [BPH], chronic prostatitis, high-grade prostate intraepithelial neoplasia [HG-PIN]) with those in men with a positive biopsy. We evaluated PCA3 repeated measures biological variability and its possible association with basic patient characteristics (age, family history of prostate cancer, DRE, prostate volume, BPH, prostatitis and HG-PIN). Three different thresholds were used to evaluate the possible changes in risk class: the standard threshold (a PCA3 score of 35), a US Food and Drug Administation-approved PCA3 threshold of 25 and a threshold selected based on our previous research which was a PCA3 score of 50.  Results:   The PCA3 scores varied significantly (P < 0.001) when comparing men with a negative biopsy with those with a positive biopsy (median [range] PCA3 score: 25 [2-276] vs 43 [7-331]). There was no significant difference in PCA3 scores in men with chronic prostatitis and HG-PIN compared with other men with negative biopsies. The median (range) time between the two PCA3 assessments was 16.2 (3-53.7) months. No association was found between PCA3 repeated measures modifications and age, family history of prostate cancer, DRE, BPH, prostatitis, HG-PIN and use of 5-α-reductase inhibitors. The variability of PCA3 scores on repeated measures confirmed the risk class for about 80% of patients; of the remaining 20% of patients, the risk class was upgraded in two thirds and downgraded in one third.  Conclusion:   PCA3 score can be considered a stable marker over time in most cases but there is a group of men among whom there is clinically notable risk class change.

Materials & methods:   The LaF3:Ce(3+)/DMSO nanoparticles have a strong green emission with a peak at approximately 520 nm, which is effectively overlapped with the absorption of protoporphyrin IX (PPIX). The nanoparticles were encapsulated into poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide (PLGA) microspheres along with PPIX.

The study objective was to identify prognostic factors associated with survival in patients with symptomatic SBM and to create a validated risk stratification model.  Methods:   All patients who were treated for symptomatic SBM between 2001 and 2010 were included in this single center retrospective study. Medical records were reviewed for type of primary cancer, performance status, presence of visceral, brain and bone metastases, number and location of spinal metastases, and neurological functioning. Performance status was assessed with the Karnofsky performance score and neurological functioning with the Frankel scale. Analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier curves, univariate log-rank tests, Cox regression models, and Harrell's C statistic.  Results:   A total of 1 043 patients were studied. The most prevalent tumors were those of breast (n = 299), lung (n = 250), and prostate (n = 215). Median follow-up duration was 6.6 years, and 6 patients were lost to follow-up. Based on the results of the uni- and multivariate analyses, 4 categories were created. Median survival in category A was 31.2 months (95% CI, 25.2-37.3 months), 15.4 months (95% CI, 11.9-18.2 months) for category B, 4.8 months (95% CI, 4.1-5.4 months) for category C, and 1.6 months (95% CI, 1.4-1.9 months) for category D.

(2) Is the bone turnover (BT) of the jaw overly altered after BP intake? (3) Are there gender- or entity-specific differences in BT before and after BP intake?  Methods:   Bone scintigraphies of 42 patients with prostate cancer were retrospectively analyzed (n = 21 with BP intake; n = 21 no BP). All patients received bone scintigraphy prior to the therapy and in the course of the treatment (after 12 and 24 months). Data were quantitatively analyzed using six predetermined regions of interest and compared with a breast cancer cohort.  Results:   The mandible revealed a similar BT as the femur and a significant lower BT compared with the maxilla. All investigated bone regions showed no significant changes under BP administration. Inter-gender differences revealed significantly lower BT values for the prostate cancer compared with the female breast cancer cohort, changes over the course of time could not be found.  Conclusions:   The finding that the mandible revealed a significant lower BT than the maxilla and the fact that 2/3 of the BRONJ cases occur in the mandible are inconsistent with the investigated hypothesis. Furthermore, the BT in the jawbone is not overly suppressed by BP.

However, its connection to nonmelanotic invasive skin cancer is unclear. This study investigated whether 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzodioxin exposure increases the incidence of this cancer.  Methods:   The authors retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 100 consecutive male patients with Fitzpatrick skin types I through IV who enrolled in the Agent Orange registry at the Veterans Affairs Hospital of Washington, D.C., between August of 2009 and January of 2010.  Results:   The study population's mean age was 65.7 years (range, 56 to 80 years). 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzodioxin exposure included living or working in contaminated areas (56 percent), actively spraying it (30 percent), or traveling in contaminated areas (14 percent). Fifty-one percent of patients had nonmelanotic invasive skin cancer; 43 percent had chloracne; and 26 percent had other malignancies, such as prostate (14 percent), colon (3 percent), or bladder cancer (2 percent). The nonmelanotic invasive skin cancer incidence rate in the study population (51 percent) was significantly higher than the national age-matched incidence rate (23.8 percent; p < 0.001). High Fitzpatrick skin type score (p = 0.010) and dark eye color (p = 0.036) were associated with a decreased incidence of the cancer. Exposure by means of active spraying (73 percent versus 67 percent; p = 0.003) and presence of chloracne (81 percent versus 28 percent; p < 0.001) were associated with increased nonmelanotic invasive skin cancer incidence rates.  Conclusions:   2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzodioxin exposure appears to be associated with the development of nonmelanotic invasive skin cancer.

By screening 102 lung adenocarcinomas negative for known oncogenic alterations, we found four additional fusion-positive tumors, all of which were of the invasive mucinous subtype. Mechanistically, CD74-NRG1 leads to extracellular expression of the EGF-like domain of NRG1 III-β3, thereby providing the ligand for ERBB2-ERBB3 receptor complexes. Accordingly, ERBB2 and ERBB3 expression was high in the index case, and expression of phospho-ERBB3 was specifically found in tumors bearing the fusion (P < 0.0001). Ectopic expression of CD74-NRG1 in lung cancer cell lines expressing ERBB2 and ERBB3 activated ERBB3 and the PI3K-AKT pathway, and led to increased colony formation in soft agar. Thus, CD74-NRG1 gene fusions are activating genomic alterations in invasive mucinous adenocarcinomas and may offer a therapeutic opportunity for a lung tumor subtype with, so far, no effective treatment.

Herein, we evaluated the association of TV with prostate cancer mortality following radical prostatectomy (RP), and assessed the additive prognostic value of TV to an established predictive model.  Methods:   We identified 13,687 patients who underwent RP without preoperative therapy between 1987 and 2009. TV was estimated using the prolate ellipsoid formula. Survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared with the log-rank test. Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to evaluate the association of TV with mortality. The ability of TV to enhance the performance of an established prognostic model (Mayo Clinic GPSM (Gleason, PSA, seminal vesicle and margin status) score) was assessed using the c-index.  Results:   Median TV was 1.57 cm(3) (interquartile range (IQR) 0.48-4.19). Increasing TV was associated with significantly higher risks of seminal vesicle invasion (hazard ratio (HR) 1.58; P<0.0001), positive surgical margins (HR 1.28; P<0.0001) and lymph node involvement (HR 1.26; P<0.0001). Median postoperative follow-up was 9.4 years (IQR 5.0-14.5). Patient grouping into quartiles according to TV resulted in a significant stratification of outcome, as the 15-year cancer-specific survival by TV quartile was 99%, 98%, 95% and 88%, respectively (P<0.0001). Moreover, on multivariate analysis, greater TV remained associated with significantly increased risks of systemic progression (HR 1.27; P<0.0001), death from prostate cancer (HR 1.29; P<0.0001) and all-cause mortality (HR 1.05; P<0.0001). Meanwhile, addition of TV to the GPSM score increased the c-index for the model's prediction of prostate cancer mortality from 0.803 to 0.822.  Conclusions:   TV is associated with survival following RP, and enhances, although modestly, the performance of an established prediction model. As such, TV warrants continued assessment in risk stratification tools.""","""['J J Knoedler', 'R J Karnes', 'R H Thompson', 'L J Rangel', 'E J Bergstralh', 'S A Boorjian']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['The presence of extracapsular extension is associated with an increased risk of death from prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy for patients with seminal vesicle invasion and negative lymph nodes.', 'Impact of positive surgical margins on prostate-specific antigen failure after radical prostatectomy in adjuvant treatment-naïve patients.', 'Larger maximum tumor diameter at radical prostatectomy is associated with increased biochemical failure, metastasis, and death from prostate cancer after salvage radiation for prostate cancer.', 'The Role of Prostate-specific Antigen Persistence After Radical Prostatectomy for the Prediction of Clinical Progression and Cancer-specific Mortality in Node-positive Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'Assessing the Optimal Timing for Early Salvage Radiation Therapy in Patients with Prostate-specific Antigen Rise After Radical Prostatectomy.', 'MRI-derived tumor volume as a predictor of biochemical recurrence and adverse pathology in patients after radical prostatectomy: a propensity score matching study.', 'The Quantitative Assessment of Using Multiparametric MRI for Prediction of Extraprostatic Extension in Patients Undergoing Radical Prostatectomy: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'Algorithms applied to spatially registered multi-parametric MRI for prostate tumor volume measurement.', ""Prostate cancer measurements on serial MRI during active surveillance: it's time to be PRECISE."", 'Effect of observation size and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value in PI-RADS v2.1 assessment category 4 and 5 observations compared to adverse pathological outcomes.']"""

Methods:   We retrospectively reviewed the clinical records of 115 patients who underwent multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging before radical prostatectomy. We used Epstein's criteria of insignificant disease with and without a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) parameter (apparent diffusion coefficient) to calculate sensitivity, specificity, as well as negative and positive predictive values [NPV and PPV] across varying definitions of clinically significant cancer based on Gleason grade and tumor volume (0.2 mL, 0.5 mL, and 1.3 mL) on whole-mount prostate specimens. Logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the incremental benefit of MRI in delineating significant cancer.  Results:   The majority had a prostate-specific antigen from 4.1-10.0 (67%), normal rectal examinations (90%), biopsy Gleason score ≤ 6 (68%), and ≤ 2 cores positive (55%). Of the 58 patients pathologically staged with Gleason 7 or pT3 disease at prostatectomy, Epstein's criteria alone missed 12 patients (sensitivity of 79% and NPV of 68%). Addition of apparent diffusion coefficient improved the sensitivity and NPV for predicting significant disease at prostatectomy to 93% and 84%, respectively. MRI improved detection of large Gleason 6 (≥ 1.3 mL, P = .006) or Gleason ≥ 7 lesions of any size (P <.001).

NMF reduces the dimensionality of non-negative data by decomposing it into two smaller non-negative factors with physical interpretation for class discovery. The NMF algorithm, however, assumes a deterministic framework. In particular, the effect of the data noise on the stability of the factorization and the convergence of the algorithm are unknown. Collected data, on the other hand, is stochastic in nature due to measurement noise and sometimes inherent variability in the physical process. This paper presents new theoretical and applied developments to the problem of non-negative matrix factorization (NMF). First, we generalize the deterministic NMF algorithm to include a general class of update rules that converges towards an optimal non-negative factorization. Second, we extend the NMF framework to the probabilistic case (PNMF). We show that the Maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the non-negative factors is the solution to a weighted regularized non-negative matrix factorization problem. We subsequently derive update rules that converge towards an optimal solution. Third, we apply the PNMF to cluster and classify DNA microarrays data. The proposed PNMF is shown to outperform the deterministic NMF and the sparse NMF algorithms in clustering stability and classification accuracy.""","""['Belhassen Bayar', 'Nidhal Bouaynaya', 'Roman Shterenberg']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Bioinform Comput Biol""","""['Multiplicative update rules for concurrent nonnegative matrix factorization and maximum margin classification.', 'Non-negative matrix factorization of gene expression profiles: a plug-in for BRB-ArrayTools.', 'Metagenes and molecular pattern discovery using matrix factorization.', 'Application of non-negative matrix factorization in oncology: one approach for establishing precision medicine.', 'Comparison and evaluation of integrative methods for the analysis of multilevel omics data: a study based on simulated and experimental cancer data.', 'Role of epithelial cell-mesenchymal transition regulators in molecular typing and prognosis of colon cancer.', 'High dimensionality reduction by matrix factorization for systems pharmacology.', 'Attention-Based Multi-NMF Deep Neural Network with Multimodality Data for Breast Cancer Prognosis Model.', 'A sequential Monte Carlo approach to gene expression deconvolution.']"""

This is the first study to date that has investigated the potential role of exercise in preventing ADT toxicity rather than recovering from established toxicities.  Patients and methods:   Sixty-three men scheduled to receive ADT were randomly assigned to a 3-month supervised exercise programme involving aerobic and resistance exercise sessions commenced within 10 days of their first ADT injection (32 men) or usual care (31 men). The primary outcome was body composition (lean and fat mass). Other study outcomes included bone mineral density, physical function, blood biomarkers of chronic disease risk and bone turnover, general and prostate cancer-specific quality of life, fatigue and psychological distress. Outcomes were compared between groups using analysis of covariance adjusted for baseline values.  Results:   Compared to usual care, a 3-month exercise programme preserved appendicular lean mass (P = 0.019) and prevented gains in whole body fat mass, trunk fat mass and percentage fat with group differences of -1.4 kg (P = 0.001), -0.9 kg (P = 0.008) and -1.3% (P < 0.001), respectively.

Paclitaxel (PTX) is one of the well-known choice as antineoplasitic agent used for the treatment of different types of human cancers such as non-small-cell lung, head and neck cancers, leukemia, breast, ovarian and melanoma. Lactoferrin (Lf), a ""multifunctional protein"" is crucial for natural immunity which is secreted by exocrine glands. Lf receptors are expressed on the apical surface on bronchial epithelial cells. These over-expressed LF receptors can be utilized for the transportation of Lf-conjugated drug or nanocarrier devices. The present study was aimed to develop PTX-loaded Lf-coupled solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) for the treatment of lung cancer. PTX-loaded SLNs were prepared, characterized and then coupled with Lf using carbodiimide chemistry. The formulations were characterized by transmission electron microscopy, particle size, polydispersity index and zeta potential, whereas Lf conjugation was confirmed by FT-IR and ¹H NMR and efficiency of prepared system was evaluated by in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo evaluations. The ex vivo cytotoxicity studies on human bronchial epithelial cell lines, BEAS-2B, revealed superior anticancer activity of Lf-coupled SLNs than plain SLNs and free PTX.

Our aims were to investigate the interobserver variability of this diagnosis among experts in uropathology and to define diagnostic criteria.  Methods and results:   Photomicrographs of 21 carcinomas with ductal features were distributed among 20 genitourinary pathologists from eight countries. DAC was diagnosed by 18 observers (mean 13.2 cases, range 6-19). In 11 (52%) cases, a 2/3 consensus was reached for a diagnosis of DAC, and in five (24%) there was consensus against. In DAC, the respondents reported papillary architecture (86%), stratification of nuclei (82%), high-grade nuclear features (54%), tall columnar epithelium (53%), elongated nuclei (52%), cribriform architecture (40%), and necrosis (7%). The most important diagnostic feature reported for DAC was papillary architecture (59%), whereas nuclear and cellular features were considered to be most important in only 2-11% of cases. The most common differential diagnoses were intraductal prostate cancer (52%), high-grade PIN (37%), and acinar adenocarcinoma (17%). The most common reason for not diagnosing DAC was lack of typical architecture (33%).  Conclusions:   Papillary architecture was the most useful diagnostic feature of DAC, and nuclear and cellular features were considered to be less important.""","""['Amanda H Seipel', 'Brett Delahunt', 'Hemamali Samaratunga', 'Mahul Amin', 'Joel Barton', 'Daniel M Berney', 'Athanase Billis', 'Liang Cheng', 'Eva Comperat', 'Andrew Evans', 'Samson W Fine', 'David Grignon', 'Peter A Humphrey', 'Cristina Magi-Galluzzi', 'Rodolfo Montironi', 'Isabell Sesterhenn', 'John R Srigley', 'Kiril Trpkov', 'Theo van der Kwast', 'Murali Varma', 'Ming Zhou', 'Amar Ahmad', 'Sue Moss', 'Lars Egevad']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Histopathology""","""['Ductal adenocarcinoma of the prostate: histogenesis, biology and clinicopathological features.', 'High-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasialike ductal adenocarcinoma of the prostate: a clinicopathologic study of 28 cases.', 'Histopathological features of ductal adenocarcinoma of the prostate in 1,051 radical prostatectomy specimens.', 'Intraductal carcinoma of the prostate: interobserver reproducibility survey of 39 urologic pathologists.', 'Optimizing the diagnosis and management of ductal prostate cancer.', 'Cribriform Patterned Lesions in the Prostate Gland with Emphasis on Differential Diagnosis and Clinical Significance.', 'WHO Classification of Tumours fifth edition: evolving issues in the classification, diagnosis, and prognostication of prostate cancer.', 'Ductal adenocarcinoma of the prostate: A systematic review and meta-analysis of incidence, presentation, prognosis, and management.', 'Infiltrative growth pattern of prostate cancer is associated with lower uptake on PSMA PET and reduced diffusion restriction on mpMRI.', 'Oncological outcomes of patients with ductal adenocarcinoma of the prostate receiving radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy.']"""

In the present study, we have investigated whether ketoconazole affects the cellular uptake and hydrolysis of the endogenous cannabinoid receptor ligand anandamide (AEA).  Methodology/principal findings:   The effects of ketoconazole upon endocannabinoid uptake were investigated using HepG2, CaCo2, PC-3 and C6 cell lines. Fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) activity was measured in HepG2 cell lysates and in intact C6 cells. Ketoconazole inhibited the uptake of AEA by HepG2 cells and CaCo2 cells with IC50 values of 17 and 18 µM, respectively. In contrast, it had modest effects upon AEA uptake in PC-3 cells, which have a low expression of FAAH. In cell-free HepG2 lysates, ketoconazole inhibited FAAH activity with an IC50 value (for the inhibitable component) of 34 µM.  Conclusions/significance:   The present study indicates that ketoconazole can inhibit the cellular uptake of AEA at pharmacologically relevant concentrations, primarily due to its effects upon FAAH.

In prostate cancer (PCa) cells, ADT may enhance AR activity through induction of oxidative stress. Herein, we investigated the roles of Nrf1 and Nrf2, transcription factors that regulate antioxidant gene expression, on hormone-mediated AR transactivation using a syngeneic in vitro model of androgen dependent (LNCaP) and castration resistant (C4-2B) PCa cells. Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) stimulated transactivation of the androgen response element (ARE) was significantly greater in C4-2B cells than in LNCaP cells. DHT-induced AR transactivation was coupled with higher nuclear translocation of p65-Nrf1 in C4-2B cells, as compared to LNCaP cells. Conversely, DHT stimulation suppressed total Nrf2 levels in C4-2B cells but elevated total Nrf2 levels in LNCaP cells. Interestingly, siRNA mediated silencing of Nrf1 attenuated AR transactivation while p65-Nrf1 overexpression enhanced AR transactivation. Subsequent studies showed that Nrf1 physically interacts with AR and enhances AR's DNA-binding activity, suggesting that the p65-Nrf1 isoform is a potential AR coactivator. In contrast, Nrf2 suppressed AR-mediated transactivation by stimulating the nuclear accumulation of the p120-Nrf1 which suppressed AR transactivation. Quantitative RT-PCR studies further validated the inductive effects of p65-Nrf1 isoform on the androgen regulated genes, PSA and TMPRSS2. Therefore, our findings implicate differential roles of Nrf1 and Nrf2 in regulating AR transactivation in PCa cells. Our findings also indicate that the DHT-stimulated increase in p65-Nrf1 and the simultaneous suppression of both Nrf2 and p120-Nrf1 ultimately facilitates AR transactivation in CRPC cells.""","""['Michelle A Schultz', 'Sharika S Hagan', 'Amrita Datta', 'Yiguo Zhang', 'Michael L Freeman', 'Suresh C Sikka', 'Asim B Abdel-Mageed', 'Debasis Mondal']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['The nrf1 and nrf2 balance in oxidative stress regulation and androgen signaling in prostate cancer cells.', 'RELA is sufficient to mediate interleukin-1 repression of androgen receptor expression and activity in an LNCaP disease progression model.', 'Regulatory effect of Skp2 on the expression and transactivation of the androgen receptor in the progression of castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptor: what we know and what we expect in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Unravelling the role of NFE2L1 in stress responses and related diseases.', '5-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic Acid Controls Androgen Reduction in Diverse Types of Human Epithelial Cells.', 'The ERα-NRF2 signalling axis promotes bicalutamide resistance in prostate cancer.', 'NRF2: A crucial regulator for mitochondrial metabolic shift and prostate cancer progression.', 'Combination of the NRF2 Inhibitor and Autophagy Inhibitor Significantly Inhibited Tumorigenicity of Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.']"""

Phytochemicals such as sulforaphane (SFN) and 3,3'-diindolylmethane (DIM) are promising chemopreventive agents for the treatment of prostate cancer. Both have been shown to induce re-expression of genes, including tumor suppressor genes silenced in cancer cells, via modulation of epigenetic marks including DNA methylation. However, it remained unclear the effects SFN and DIM on DNA methylation at a genomic scale. The goal of this study was to determine the genome-wide effects of SFN and DIM on promoter methylation in normal prostate epithelial cells and prostate cancer cells. Both SFN and DIM treatment decreased DNA methyltransferase expression in normal prostate epithelial cells (PrEC), and androgen-dependent (LnCAP) and androgen-independent (PC3) prostate cancer cells. The effects of SFN and DIM on promoter methylation profiles in normal PrEC, LnCAP and PC3 prostate cancer cells were determined using methyl-DNA immunoprecipitation followed by genome-wide DNA methylation array. We showed widespread changes in promoter methylation patterns, including both increased and decreased methylation, in all three prostate cell lines in response to SFN or DIM treatments. In particular, SFN and DIM altered promoter methylation in distinct sets of genes in PrEC, LnCAP, and PC3 cells, but shared similar gene targets within a single cell line. We further showed that SFN and DIM reversed many of the cancer-associated methylation alterations, including aberrantly methylated genes that are dysregulated or are highly involved in cancer progression. Overall, our data suggested that both SFN and DIM are epigenetic modulators that have broad and complex effects on DNA methylation profiles in both normal and cancerous prostate epithelial cells.

We have previously identified and electrophysiologically characterized a novel Ca(2+)-permeable channel activated during apoptosis in the androgen-independent prostate epithelial cancer cell line, LNCaP. In addition, we reported for the first time the cloning and characterization of this channel-like molecule named apoptosis regulated protein 2 (ARP2) associated to a lethal influx of Ca(2+) in Xenopus oocytes. In the present study, LNCaP cells and Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO cell line) transfected with arp2-cDNA are induced to undergo apoptosis showing an important impact on cell viability and activation of caspases 3 and 7 when compared to serum deprived grown cells and ionomycin treated cells. The subcellular localization of ARP2 in CHO cells undergoing apoptosis was studied using confocal microscopy. While apoptosis progresses, ARP2 initially localized in the peri-nuclear region of cells migrates with time towards the plasma membrane region. Based on the present results and those of our previous studies, the fact that ARP2 constitutes a novel cation channel is supported.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether PTHrP could promote epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process implicated in cancer stem cells that is critically involved in cancer invasion and metastasis. EMT was observed in DU 145 prostate cancer cells stably overexpressing either the 1-141 or 1-173 isoform of PTHrP, where there was upregulation of Snail and vimentin and downregulation of E-cadherin relative to parental DU 145. By contrast, the opposite effect was observed in PC-3 prostate cancer cells where high levels of PTHrP were knocked-down via lentiviral siRNA transduction. Increased tumor progression was observed in PTHrP-overexpressing DU 145 cells while decreased progression was observed in PTHrP-knockdown PC-3 cells. PTHrP-overexpressing DU 145 formed larger tumors when implanted orthoptopically into nude mice and in one case resulted in spinal metastasis, an effect not observed among mice injected with parental DU 145 cells. PTHrP-overexpressing DU 145 cells also caused significant bone destruction when injected into the tibiae of nude mice, while parental DU 145 cells caused little to no destruction of bone. Together, these results suggest that PTHrP may work through EMT to promote an aggressive and metastatic phenotype in prostate cancer, a pathway of importance in cancer stem cells. Thus, continued efforts to elucidate the pathways involved in PTHrP-induced EMT as well as to develop ways to specifically target PTHrP signaling may lead to more effective therapies for prostate cancer.""","""['Weg M Ongkeko', 'Doug Burton', 'Alan Kiang', 'Eric Abhold', 'Selena Z Kuo', 'Elham Rahimy', 'Meng Yang', 'Robert M Hoffman', 'Jessica Wang-Rodriguez', 'Leonard J Deftos']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['The involvement of FBP1 in prostate cancer cell epithelial mesenchymal transition, invasion and metastasis by regulating the MAPK signaling pathway.', 'An hTERT/ZEB1 complex directly regulates E-cadherin to promote epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in colorectal cancer.', 'Nuclear localization of parathyroid hormone-related peptide confers resistance to anoikis in prostate cancer cells.', 'TGF-β1 promotes epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and stemness of prostate cancer cells by inducing PCBP1 degradation and alternative splicing of CD44.', 'The role of Snail in prostate cancer.', 'Prostate cancer bone metastases biology and clinical management (Review).', 'Compressed Prostate Cancer Cells Decrease Osteoclast Activity While Enhancing Osteoblast Activity In Vitro.', 'Endocrine and paracrine characteristics of neuroendocrine prostate cancer.', 'Involvement of Met receptor pathway in aggressive behavior of colorectal cancer cells induced by parathyroid hormone-related peptide.', 'Parathyroid Hormone-Related Protein Inhibition Blocks Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Expansion in Bone Through Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition Reversal.']"""

Interestingly, no prognostic gene classes were identified in squamous cell lung carcinoma or head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Next, a specific 31 gene cell cycle proliferation (CCP) signature, previously derived in prostate tumors was evaluated and found predictive of outcome in BL and LUAD cohorts in univariate and multivariate analyses. Specifically, CCP score significantly enhanced the predictive ability of multivariate models based on standard clinical variables for progression in BL patients and survival in LUAD patients in multiple cohorts. We then generated random CCP signatures of various sizes and found sets of 10-15 genes had robust performance in these BL and LUAD cohorts, a finding that was confirmed in an independent cohort.

The aim of this retrospective study is to identify factors affecting the UR after HoLEP.  Materials and methods:   336 patients, which underwent HoLEP for a symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia between July 2008 and March 2012, were included in this study. Urethral catheters were routinely removed one or two days after surgery. UR was defined as the need for an indwelling catheter placement following a failure to void after catheter removal. Demographic and clinical parameters were compared between the UR (n = 37) and the non-urinary retention (non-UR; n = 299) groups.  Results:   The mean age of patients was 68.3 (±6.5) years and the mean operative time was 75.3 (±37.4) min. Thirty seven patients (11.0%) experienced a postoperative UR. UR patients voided catheter free an average of 1.9 (±1.7) days after UR. With regard to the causes of UR, 24 (7.1%) and 13 (3.9%) patients experienced a blood clot-related UR and a non-clot related UR respectively. Using multivariate analysis (p<0.05), we found significant differences between the UR and the non-UR groups with regard to a morcellation efficiency (OR 0.701, 95% CI 0.498-0.988) and a bleeding-related complication, such as, a reoperation for bleeding (OR 0.039, 95% CI 0.004-0.383) or a transfusion (OR 0.144, 95% CI 0.027-0.877). Age, history of diabetes, prostate volume, pre-operative post-void residual, bladder contractility index, learning curve, and operative time were not significantly associated with the UR (p>0.05).  Conclusions:   De novo UR after HoLEP was found to be self-limited and it was not related to learning curve, patient age, diabetes, or operative time.

Recent studies have identified new membrane-bound EpCAM variants. To evaluate the prevalence of two membranous EpCAM variants in human tumours, we performed a large-scale expression analysis using specific antibodies against the extracellular domain EpEX (MOC-31 clone) and the intracellular domain EpICD (9-2 clone) of the EpCAM antigen by immunohistochemistry.  Material and methods:   Two multi-tissue microarrays (TMA) series containing 1564 tissue samples each of 53 different histological tumour types were stained and compared. One TMA was stained for EpEX and one for EpICD.

Here, a role for AnxA1 in prostate adenocarcinoma was determined using primary cultures and a tumor cell line (cE1), all derived from the conditional Pten deletion mouse model of prostate cancer. AnxA1 secretion by prostate-derived cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) was significantly higher than by normal prostate fibroblasts (NPF). Prostate tumor cells were sorted to enrich for epithelial subpopulations based on nonhematopoietic lineage, high SCA-1, and high or medium levels of CD49f. Compared with controls, AnxA1 enhanced stem cell-like properties in high- and medium-expression subpopulations of sorted cE1 and primary cells, in vitro, through formation of greater number of spheroids with increased complexity, and in vivo, through generation of more, larger, and histologically complex glandular structures, along with increased expression of p63, a basal/progenitor marker. The differentiated medium-expression subpopulations from cE1 and primary cells were most susceptible to gain stem cell-like properties as shown by increased spheroid and glandular formation. Further supporting this increased plasticity, AnxA1 was shown to regulate epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in cE1 cells. These results suggest that CAF-secreted AnxA1 contributes to tumor stem cell dynamics via two separate but complementary pathways: induction of a dedifferentiation process leading to generation of stem-like cells from a subpopulation of cancer epithelial cells and stimulation of proliferation and differentiation of the cancer stem-like cells.  Implications:   AnxA1 participates in a paradigm in which malignant prostate epithelial cells that are not cancer stem cells are induced to gain cancer stem cell-like properties.""","""['Lauren A Geary', 'Kevin A Nash', 'Helty Adisetiyo', 'Mengmeng Liang', 'Chun-Peng Liao', 'Joseph H Jeong', 'Ebrahim Zandi', 'Pradip Roy-Burman']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Res""","""['Dependence of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) stem cells on CRPC-associated fibroblasts.', 'Contextual effect of repression of bone morphogenetic protein activity in prostate cancer.', 'Annexin A1 is involved in the acquisition and maintenance of a stem cell-like/aggressive phenotype in prostate cancer cells with acquired resistance to zoledronic acid.', 'Annexin A1 localization and its relevance to cancer.', 'Annexin A1 as a Regulator of Immune Response in Cancer.', 'Cellular and Genetic Background of Osteosarcoma.', 'Cancer-associated fibroblasts: The chief architect in the tumor microenvironment.', 'Annexin A1 affects tumor metastasis through epithelial-mesenchymal transition: a narrative review.', 'Glioma stem cell signature predicts the prognosis and the response to tumor treating fields treatment.', 'Identification of novel biomarkers differentially expressed between African-American and Caucasian-American prostate cancer patients.']"""

Curcumin, a curcuminoid present in Curcuma longa, shown to exhibit antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anticarcinogenic properties. Present study, we aimed to analyze inhibitory properties of curcumin towards virulent proteins for various cancers by computer aided virtual screening. Based on literature studies, twenty two receptors were selected which have critical virulent functions in various cancer. The binding efficiencies of curcumin towards selected targets were studied by molecular docking. Out of all, curcumin showed best results towards epidermal growth factor (EGF), virulent protein of gastric cancer; glutathione-S-transferase Pi gene (GST-PI), virulent protein for prostate cancer; platelet-derived growth factor alpha (PDGFA), virulent protein for mesothelioma and glioma compared with their natural ligands. The calculated binding energies of their docked conformations with curcumin found to be -7.59 kcal/mol, -7.98 kcal/mol and -7.93 kcal/mol respectively. Further, a comparative study was performed to screen binding efficiency of curcumin with two conventional antitumor agents, litreol and triterpene. Docking studies revealed that calculated binding energies of docked complex of litreol and EGF, GST-PI and PDGFA were found to be -5.08 kcal/mol, -3.69 kcal/mol and -1.86 kcal/mol respectively. The calculated binding energies of triterpene with EGF and PDGFA were found to be -4.02 kcal/mol and -3.11 kcal/mol respectively, whereas GST-PI showed +6.07 kcal/mol, indicate poor binding. The predicted pharmacological features of curcumin found to be better than litreol and triterpene.

Aberrant activation of canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway has been observed in colon cancer. In contrast, the non-canonical Wnt signaling functions remain obscure. Wnt5a is a representative non-canonical Wnt ligand which has gained extensive attention nowadays. Wnt5a has been shown to play an important role in EMT in prostate cancer and melanoma, but its role in colon cancer is still ambiguous. Here we have evaluated Wnt5a expression in a large cohort of 217 colon cancers by immunohistochemistry and analyzed its correlation with clinicopathologic characteristics. We found that expression of Wnt5a was diminished significantly in majority of primary colon cancers and negatively related with EMT biomarkers. To further enlighten the mechanism which Wnt5a regulates EMT in vitro, we established ectopic Wnt5a expression models. Protein analysis demonstrated that Wnt5a inhibited EMT and antagonized canonical Wnt signaling in colon cancer cells. Overexpression of Wnt5a impaired cell motility and invasion and inhibited cell proliferation by manipulating Bax. Moreover, Wnt5a suppressed the tumor growth in nude mice and impaired tumorigenicity in vivo. Wnt5a also induced intracellular calcium and activated non-canonical Wnt/Ca(2+) signaling in colon cancer. In summary, although Wnt5a was down-regulated in majority of colon cancers, enhanced Wnt5a expression predict preferable outcome in colon cancer patients. Our findings indicate that Wnt5a might act as tumor suppressor by inhibiting cell proliferation and attenuating EMT in colon cancer cells. Wnt5a could be used as a novel prognostic marker and/or therapeutic target for colon cancer in the future.""","""['Runfen Cheng', 'Baocun Sun', 'Zhiyong Liu', 'Xiulan Zhao', 'Lisha Qi', 'Yixian Li', 'Qiang Gu']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""J Cell Physiol""","""['Wnt5a promotes human colon cancer cell migration and invasion but does not augment intestinal tumorigenesis in Apc1638N mice.', 'The non-canonical Wnt ligand, Wnt5a, is upregulated and associated with epithelial to mesenchymal transition in epithelial ovarian cancer.', 'Upregulation of Wnt5a promotes epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and metastasis of pancreatic cancer cells.', 'Can Wnt5a and Wnt non-canonical pathways really mediate adipocyte de-differentiation in a tumour microenvironment?', 'WNT5A in tumor development and progression: A comprehensive review.', 'Aberrant expression of UBE2C in endometrial cancer and its correlation to epithelial mesenchymal transition.', 'The Roles of Secreted Wnt Ligands in Cancer.', 'Using PDX animal models to identify and stratify adenoid cystic carcinoma patients presenting an enhanced response to HDAC inhibitors.', 'Advances of Wnt Signalling Pathway in Colorectal Cancer.', 'Integrated analysis of necroptosis-related genes for evaluating immune infiltration and colon cancer prognosis.']"""

For instance, in medical imaging, radiologists often delineate malignant and benign tissues without access to the histological ground truth, leading to uncertain data sets. This paper addresses the pattern classification problem arising when available target data include some uncertainty information. Target data considered here are both qualitative (a class label) or quantitative (an estimation of the posterior probability). In this context, usual discriminative methods, such as the support vector machine (SVM), fail either to learn a robust classifier or to predict accurate probability estimates. We generalize the regular SVM by introducing a new formulation of the learning problem to take into account class labels as well as class probability estimates. This original reformulation into a probabilistic SVM (P-SVM) can be efficiently solved by adapting existing flexible SVM solvers. Furthermore, this framework allows deriving a unique learned prediction function for both decision and posterior probability estimation providing qualitative and quantitative predictions. The method is first tested on synthetic data sets to evaluate its properties as compared with the classical SVM and fuzzy-SVM. It is then evaluated on a clinical data set of multiparametric prostate magnetic resonance images to assess its performances in discriminating benign from malignant tissues. P-SVM is shown to outperform classical SVM as well as the fuzzy-SVM in terms of probability predictions and classification performances, and demonstrates its potential for the design of an efficient computer-aided decision system for prostate cancer diagnosis based on multiparametric magnetic resonance (MR) imaging.""","""['Émilie Niaf', 'Rémi Flamary', 'Olivier Rouvière', 'Carole Lartizien', 'Stéphane Canu']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""IEEE Trans Image Process""","""['Combined unsupervised-supervised classification of multiparametric PET/MRI data: application to prostate cancer.', 'Automated detection of prostatic adenocarcinoma from high-resolution ex vivo MRI.', 'A fully automatic computer aided diagnosis system for peripheral zone prostate cancer detection using multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging.', 'A framework for optimal kernel-based manifold embedding of medical image data.', 'Integrated diagnostics: a conceptual framework with examples.', 'An Automated Two-step Pipeline for Aggressive Prostate Lesion Detection from Multi-parametric MR Sequence.', 'Predicting clinically significant prostate cancer from quantitative image features including compressed sensing radial MRI of prostate perfusion using machine learning: comparison with PI-RADS v2 assessment scores.', 'Objective risk stratification of prostate cancer using machine learning and radiomics applied to multiparametric magnetic resonance images.', 'MRI-based prostate cancer detection with high-level representation and hierarchical classification.', 'Computer-aided Detection of Prostate Cancer with MRI: Technology and Applications.']"""

In order to image and treat both PSMA positive and negative tissues PSMA targeting probes need to be extended by a further specificity. Since prostate cancer cells usually express both PSMA and gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR) a bispecific low-molecular heterodimeric molecule, addressing both targets at the same time, may significantly improve prostate cancer imaging and therapy.  Methods:   The nonapeptide BZH3 representing the GRPR binding part was combined with the urea-based PSMA inhibitor Glu-urea-Lys(Ahx)-HBED-CC. The syntheses of the compounds were performed according to standard Fmoc-solid phase peptide synthesis. The binding properties were analyzed by competitive cell binding and internalization experiments. The in vivo targeting properties were investigated by means of biodistribution studies.  Results:   Cell binding experiments revealed high binding affinities to both GRPR and PSMA expressing cell lines. The heterodimer bound with IC50 -values essentially matching the IC50 values of the respective monomers (25.0 ± 5.4 nM for PSMA and 9.0 ± 1.8 nM for GRPR, respectively). In vivo, the heterodimer showed dual targeting of PSMA (5.4%ID/g for PSMA-positive tumors) and GRPR receptors (3.3% ID/g for GRPR-positive tumors) while exhibiting fast pharmacokinetic properties. The clearance from background was comparable to the monomeric PSMA-targeting reference.

Thus, DTC's may be a productive target for preventing prostate cancer metastasis progression. Our prior research showed that PHSCN peptide (Ac-PHSCN-NH2) targets activated α5β1 integrin to prevent invasion and metastasis in preclinical adenocarcinoma models, and disease progression in Phase I clinical trial. Here, we report that D-stereoisomer replacement of histidine and cysteine in PHSCN produces a highly potent derivative, Ac-PhScN-NH2 (PhScN). PhScN was 27,000- to 150,000-fold more potent as an inhibitor of basement membrane invasion by DU 145 and PC-3 prostate cancer cells. A large increase in invasion-inhibitory potency occurred after covalent modification of the sulfhydryl group in PHSCN to prevent disulfide bond formation; while the potency of covalently modified PhScN was not significantly increased. Thus PhScN and PHSCN invasion inhibition occurs by a noncovalent mechanism. These peptides also displayed similar cell surface binding dissociation constants (Kd), and competed for the same site. Consistent with its increased invasion-inhibitory potency, PhScN was also a highly potent inhibitor of lung extravasation and colonization in athymic nude mice: it was several hundred- or several thousand-fold more potent than PHSCN at blocking extravasation by PC-3 or DU 145 cells, and 111,000- or 379,000-fold more potent at inhibiting lung colonization, respectively. Furthermore, systemic 5 mg/kg PhScN monotherapy was sufficient to cause complete regression of established, intramuscular DU 145 tumors.

Unfortunately, opsonins are also adsorbed. These proteins are immediately recognized by the phagocyte system with rapid clearance of the NPs from the bloodstream. Polyethyleneglycol (PEG) coating of NPs (PEGylation) is the most efficient anti-opsonization strategy. Linear chains of PEG, grafted onto the NP surface, are able to create steric hindrance, resulting in a significant inhibition of protein adsorption and less recognition by macrophages. However, excessive PEGylation can lead to a strong inhibition of cellular uptake and less efficient binding with protein targets, reducing the potential of the delivery system. To reach a compromise in this regard we employed a multi-component (MC) lipid system with uncommon properties of cell uptake and endosomal escape and increasing length of PEG chains. Nano liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (nanoLC-MS/MS) analysis allowed us to accurately determine the corona composition showing that apolipoproteins are the most abundant class in the corona and that increasing the PEG length reduced the protein adsorption and the liposomal surface affinity for apolipoproteins. Due to the abundance of apolipoproteins, we exploited the ""protein corona effect"" to deliver cationic liposome-human plasma complexes to human prostate cancer PC3 cells that express a high level of scavenger receptor class B type 1 in order to evaluate the cellular uptake efficiency of the systems used.

Methods:   Among 49898 male health professionals, we obtained dietary information through questionnaires and ascertained total and lethal prostate cancer cases from 1986 through January 31, 2010. Cox regression was used to estimate multivariable hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Tissue microarrays and immunohistochemistry were used to assess tumor biomarker expression in a subset of men. Two-sided χ(2) tests were used to calculate the P values.  Results:   Higher lycopene intake was inversely associated with total prostate cancer and more strongly with lethal prostate cancer (top vs bottom quintile: HR = 0.72; 95% CI = 0.56 to 0.94; P(trend) = .04). In a restricted population of screened participants, the inverse associations became markedly stronger (for lethal prostate cancer: HR = 0.47; 95% CI = 0.29 to 0.75; P trend = .009). Comparing different measures of dietary lycopene, early intake, but not recent intake, was inversely associated with prostate cancer. Higher lycopene intake was associated with biomarkers in the cancer indicative of less angiogenic potential.  Conclusions:   Dietary intake of lycopene was associated with reduced risk of lethal prostate cancer and with a lesser degree of angiogenesis in the tumor.

An (111)In labeled HPMA copolymer system for single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) was developed to observe the biodistribution changes associated with hyperthermia. Efficacy studies were conducted in prostate tumor bearing mice using the (90)Y HPMA copolymer with hyperthermia.  Methods:   HPMA copolymers containing 1, 4, 7, 10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid (DOTA) were synthesized by reversible addition-fragmentation transfer (RAFT) copolymerization and subsequently labeled with either (111)In for imaging or (90)Y for efficacy studies. Radiolabel stability was characterized in vitro with mouse serum. Imaging and efficacy studies were conducted in DU145 prostate tumor bearing mice. Imaging was performed using single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT). Localized mild tumor hyperthermia was achieved by plasmonic photothermal therapy using gold nanorods.  Results:   HPMA copolymer-DOTA conjugates demonstrated efficient labeling and stability for both radionuclides. Imaging analysis showed a marked increase of radiolabeled copolymer within the hyperthermia treated prostate tumors, with no significant accumulation in non-targeted tissues. The greatest reduction in tumor growth was observed in the hyperthermia treated tumors with (90)Y HPMA copolymer conjugates. Histological analysis confirmed treatment efficacy and safety.

Development of mitochondria-addressed compounds highly specific for chemical processes is one of the most promising ways to develop approaches to the treatment of inherited and age-related diseases with mitochondrial etiology. Correlation of structure and chemical activity of the test compounds from a class of lipophilic cations revealed the key role of substituents in the aromatic ring of 1,4-benzoquinones in the manifestation of high antioxidant properties. In this work, it is shown that a synthesized benzoquinone derivative conjugated in position 6 with membrane-penetrating cation of decyltriphenylphosphonium and with substituents at position 2, 3, and 5 (SkBQ) has much lower antioxidant and significantly higher prooxidant activity in comparison with similar derivatives of plasto- and toluquinone SkQ1 and SkQT1 in experiments on isolated mitochondria. At the same time, SkBQ, like SkQ1 and SkQT1, can be reduced by the respiratory chain in the center i of complex III and decrease the mitochondrial membrane potential. In cell cultures of human fibroblasts, it was revealed that SkBQ does not protect cells from apoptosis induced by hydrogen peroxide. Under the same conditions, SkQ1 and SkQT1 exhibit a powerful protective effect. Thus, SkBQ can be seen as a mitochondria-addressed prooxidant.

Morphologic alterations suggest that cytoskeleton damage is likely responsible for the superficial cytoplasmic changes, including major changes in cell shape and size and the self-excising phenomena. Unlike apoptotic bodies, the excised pieces contain ribonucleoproteins, but not organelles. These deleterious events cause a progressive, significant reduction in the tumor cell size. During nuclear alterations, the nuclei maintain their envelope during chromatolysis and karyolysis until cell death, while nucleoli undergo a characteristic segregation of their components.

To facilitate the delineation procedure, the paper proposes an intuitive approach for 3D modeling of the prostate by slice-wise best fitting ellipses.  Methods:   The proposed estimate is initialized by the definition of a few control points in a new patient. The method is not restricted to particular image modalities but assumes a smooth shape with elliptic cross sections of the object. A training data set of 23 patients was used to calculate a prior shape model. The mean shape model was evaluated based on the manual contour of 10 test patients. The patient records of training and test data are based on axial T1-weighted 3D fast-field echo (FFE) sequences. The manual contours were considered as the reference model. Volume overlap (Vo), accuracy (Ac) (both ratio, range 0-1, optimal value 1) and Hausdorff distance (HD) (mm, optimal value 0) were calculated as evaluation parameters.  Results:   The median and median absolute deviation (MAD) between manual delineation and deformed mean best fitting ellipses (MBFE) was Vo (0.9 ± 0.02), Ac (0.81 ± 0.03) and HD (4.05 ± 1.3)mm and between manual delineation and best fitting ellipses (BFE) was Vo (0.96 ± 0.01), Ac (0.92 ± 0.01) and HD (1.6 ± 0.27)mm. Additional results show a moderate improvement of the MBFE results after Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) method.  Conclusions:   The results emphasize the potential of the proposed method of modeling the prostate by best fitting ellipses. It shows the robustness and reproducibility of the model.

Results:   During the 8-year study period, 16,801 new cancer cases were registered. Based on the computed ASRs, the five most frequent malignancies in females were breast (26.4 per 100,000), skin (13.6), colorectal (5.72), stomach (4.31) and bladder(4.07) and in males, the five most frequent were skin (16.0 per 100,000), bladder (10.7),prostate (7.64), stomach (7.17), and colorectal (6.32).The ASR for all malignancies in women was 92.5 per 100,000, and that for men was 87.4.

This can be challenging if organ-at-risk (OAR) dose data are incomplete, i.e. due to a limited ultrasound imaging field-of-view in the HDR BT procedure. This work proposes a method that provides estimates of composite OAR doses for such situations.  Material and methods:   Original EBRT, simulated HDR BT, and composite dose-volume histograms (DVHs) for 10 pelvic OARs in 30 prostate cancer cases were used for method implementation and evaluation (EBRT: 25×2.0 Gy+BT: 2×10.0 Gy). The proposed method used information from the EBRT DVH to estimate OAR BT doses (with or without fractionation correction). Coefficients of determination (R2) were calculated for linear relationships between several EBRT DVH parameters and a BT DVH parameter of interest. The largest R2 value decided the relationship that best predicted the BT DVH parameter. The composite dose value was then calculated by adding the EBRT DVH and the estimated BT DVH parameter values and was compared to the reference composite value (in 1200 OAR/patient/parameter cases).  Results:   The linear relationships had an average R2 of 0.68 (range 0.42-0.88). Only one ninth of the 1200 estimated composite DVH values differed more than 2 Gy from their reference values.  Conclusion:   Given a successful implementation, the proposed method only requires original or simulated BT plan data for a subset of patients to estimate composite doses for large study populations in a time-efficient manner. This can assist in evaluating radiation-induced late toxicity in multimodality treatments with limited OAR dose data.""","""['Niclas Pettersson', 'Karl-Axel Johansson', 'David Alsadius', 'Susan L Tucker', 'Gunnar Steineck', 'Caroline Olsson']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Acta Oncol""","""[""Patient's specific integration of OAR doses (D2\xa0cc) from EBRT and 3D image-guided brachytherapy for cervical cancer."", 'Accumulation of rectum dose-volume metrics for prostate external beam radiotherapy combined with brachytherapy: Evaluating deformably registered dose distribution addition using parameter-based addition.', 'Acute genitourinary toxicity after high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy combined with hypofractionated external-beam radiation therapy for localized prostate cancer: correlation between the urethral dose in HDR brachytherapy and the severity of acute genitourinary toxicity.', 'High dose rate brachytherapy in the treatment of prostate cancer.', 'Use of three-dimensional radiation therapy planning tools and intraoperative ultrasound to evaluate high dose rate prostate brachytherapy implants.', 'Methodology of dose calculation for external beam radiation combined with high dose rate brachytherapy in the era of 3-dimensional treatment planning system.', 'Urinary bladder dose-response relationships for patient-reported genitourinary morbidity domains following prostate cancer radiotherapy.']"""
